At Santa Cruz (ca &apos;81) we had a<br/>Buchla hybrid system, an analog synth with a touch sensitive keyboard hooked<br/>up to a rudimentary computer with a hexadecimal keypad for entry and a<br/>cassette recorder for memory.  Entering a minute-long sequence in machine<br/>code meant perhaps 8 hours (and small hours they were, in the middle of the<br/>night), and error correction was done by listening to the cassette and<br/>re-recording.</p><p>(To keep this on topic, the Buchla&apos;s oscillators were 2.4v/octave, in steps<br/>of .1v, thus quartertones were possible; I made a piece in 8tet).</p><p>While there was an emerging scene at places like Santa Cruz, Mills, or<br/>Wesleyan which involved small computers, almost all the big money was going<br/>into the mainframes (Stanford, IRCAM etc.). The time-sharing arrangements on<br/>the (then-)big machines seemed predestined to lead to conflicts, with the<br/>power-plays over computer time now legendary and precious little in the way<br/>of composition was actually finished.</p><p>Fortunately, for musical applications, the differences between small and<br/>large platforms are basically gone.  Music-politics-wise, though, I have my<br/>doubts...</p><p>I do stand by my statement that:</p><p>&quot;Indeed, I would not be surprised if the csound users&apos; community was largely<br/>made up of people who started out to compose and then became progressively<br/>more engaged with technical issues.&quot;</p><p>Again and again, I have come into contact with people in the computer music<br/>world who identify themselves as composers, and I take them at their word<br/>(however they may be trained or employed).  But -- when asked what they are<br/>up to at the moment, it is usually the case that some technical problem had<br/>once again got in the way of actually composing and their energies and<br/>attentions were reserved for the technical issue.</p><p>But maybe I&apos;m being to hard on this particular community.  I would wager<br/>that if one were to take a &quot;where are they now?&quot; survey of graduates from<br/>composition seminars at major music schools or universities in the States,<br/>one would find that the vast majority were not active as composers ten years<br/>later.  (And recalling those seminar days, there were always a good number<br/>then who already had trouble producing finished works, meeting deadlines, or<br/>simply got terminally blocked).</p><p>Daniel Wolf<br/>Zeneszerz&iuml;&iquest;&half;&quot;<br/>Budapest/Magyarors&iuml;&iquest;&half;g</p></div><h3><a id=17337 href="#17337">ðŸ”—</a>Joseph Pehrson &#x3C;josephpehrson@compuserve.com&#x3E;</h3><span>1/9/2001 6:14:44 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@egroups.com">tuning@egroups.com</a>, &quot;Daniel Wolf&quot; &lt;djwolf1@m...&gt; wrote:</p><p><a href="http://www.egroups.com/message/tuning/17334">http://www.egroups.com/message/tuning/17334</a></p><p>&gt; But maybe I&apos;m being to hard on this particular community.

Another<br/>&quot;upside&quot; for the music-science types could be the fact that, unlike<br/>some of the composition graduates, the musicians with the technical<br/>and mathematical expertise to do advanced computer music could<br/>probably readily find some other decent paying jobs of one kind or<br/>another, regardless of whether they managed, as some undoubtedly did,<br/>to continue their compositional pursuits....</p><p>______ _____ ____ _<br/>Joseph Pehrson</p></div><h3><a id=17435 href="#17435">ðŸ”—</a>J.P.FFITCH@MATHS.BATH.AC.UK</h3><span>1/12/2001 10:10:23 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Sometimes one reads ones own obituary, and sometimes one overhears the<br/>world&apos;s view of oneself.

As a<br/>Csound user for about 10 years, and a contributer of a microtonal<br/>piece to the Csound Book CD, I realise that my personal aesthetic is<br/>way out of line with most of this list. As Daniel Wolf said:<br/>&quot;Indeed, I would not be surprised if the csound users&apos; community was<br/>largely made up of people who started out to compose and then became<br/>progressively more engaged with technical issues.&quot;</p><p>Many of my Csound friends do not fit that pattern (and I guess some<br/>do).  I started life as a mathematician (well I was by 3, and I was the<br/>youngest of a family in which only my mother lacks a mathematics<br/>degree).  I was 9 or 13 before I started writing down compositions,<br/>and 16 before I spent significant amounts of time on it.  Meeting<br/>musicians and composers at College (we had a near-professional choir<br/>and the like) I was disheartened and concentrated on mathematics and<br/>later computing and astronomy.  Csound has changed all that for me, as<br/>I can now hear what I write, and I have been able to free myself from<br/>the major-minor prison I so dislike.</p><p>My current aim with Csound is twofold: first to realise the pieces in<br/>my head, finish my 1990 piece (oh that I could!), start the opera, etc<br/>etc (and I know that the chances are that none of my output will every<br/>be performed); and secondly to provide a computer system for free to<br/>any composer who wants it so they will not have to become (bad)<br/>techies.  I deal with a number of composers in my e-mail, from many<br/>different gendres, and I seek as far as I can and as far as I have time<br/>to provide them with the facilities they request; I do not require a<br/>quality test, as anyway I am no judge of jazz, and even less of pop,<br/>dancem or whatever it is caled.  There are of course technically<br/>competent composers who can and do look after themselves, but I think<br/>you underestimate quite how much is happening out there.  Much is not<br/>in the USA for example.<br/>  I did write support for nET tuning, and Pierce scale, and irregular<br/>tuning (Lydia said there was no need for JI support).

Hello Mr. ffitch!  May I politely say that I don&apos;t see how you<br/>could infer an assessment of your esthetic from anything that has<br/>appeared on this list, at least within this last year!  I also<br/>enjoyed your CSOUND piece &quot;Drums and Different Canons,&quot; but you have<br/>to admit it is not a lengthy piece... let&apos;s say like Bill Alves<br/>masterwork, and that was the only reason your name didn&apos;t come up.</p><p>Strictly speaking, from a composer point of view, if I may be so<br/>narcissistic as to offer one, a composer needs a tool that can be<br/>pretty easily operable, thereby offering maximum compositional time<br/>proportional to learning and operational effort.  Time is composition<br/>time and my feeling, at present, is that CSOUND is not truly a<br/>&quot;finished&quot; product in this sense.</p><p>For example, even our own Robert Walker spends hours and hours<br/>debugging code on his Fractal Tune Smithy in order to make the<br/>operation smooth.  However, on CSOUND, I find that half of the time<br/>things will not &quot;render&quot; without some kind of error messages.  It&apos;s<br/>very &quot;flakey&quot; in this respect.</p><p>Of course, the resultant sounds are very beautiful and, naturally,<br/>the glissandos and echos and all the rest can certainly not be done<br/>in MIDI.</p><p>The fact is, MIDI is a lot easier to operate and time can be spent<br/>actually COMPOSING rather than programming.  Sure, there has been a<br/>lot of bad music written in the genre, but that applies to<br/>practically everything....  I don&apos;t believe an overall &quot;categorical&quot;<br/>assessment of the composers due to the medium is applicable.  You<br/>certainly would be appalled if one were ever to try any such thing<br/>concerning CSOUND composers!</p><p>I continue to work at learning CSOUND.  HOWEVER, I still feel that<br/>the time investment may not be the best use of my own particular<br/>abilities and interests.  I want to &quot;get going&quot; on the creation end,<br/>not necessarily the technical end... although, admittedly that can be<br/>fun at times.</p><p>Pat Pagano was mentioning that there was a certain &quot;freedom&quot; in<br/>having a &quot;do it yourself&quot; product.  There is some truth to this.<br/>However, a more &quot;commercial&quot; product, i.e. one that has been<br/>engineered better so that it is &quot;friendlier&quot; for composers in the<br/>time-management sense, could be just as beneficial if not moreso...<br/>since time, for the composing set, may not be money, but time is<br/>still<br/>t  i  m  e.</p><p>________ ________ ______ _<br/>Joseph Pehrson</p></div>
