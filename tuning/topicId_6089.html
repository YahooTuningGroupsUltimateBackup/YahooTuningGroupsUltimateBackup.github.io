That means that we&apos;d have</p><p>         D       1<br/>         F       19/16<br/>         A       5/3<br/>&gt;&gt;</p><p>You must mean:</p><p>D 1/1<br/>F 19/16<br/>A 3/2</p><p>&lt;&lt;<br/> Although D is clearly the root, as opposed to Bb (8/5 relative to D), I<br/> don&apos;t think that that&apos;s what good singers would do, because of the large<br/> third between F and A involving the primes 3, 5, and 19.<br/>&gt;&gt;</p><p>The interval between F and A is 24/19. No 5&apos;s.</p><p>&lt;&lt;<br/>Also, this tuning<br/> does not have the property of the minor triad being formed by the swapping<br/> of thirds of two different sizes (unless you think a D major triad would<br/> tune as 1 80/57 3/2). Furthermore, the tuning you suggest would not easily<br/> allow the addition of C and E to make D-7 and D-9, so I&apos;m not convinced.<br/>  &gt;&gt;</p><p>While the minor triad 16:19:24 is very much more pleasant (it was either Lou<br/>Harrison or Tom Stone who called the 19:16  &quot;nature&apos;s own minor third&quot;) than<br/>the Major triad found by inversion:<br/>38:48:57, the latter is extremely close to the 12tet and certainly better<br/>than the pythagorean 64:81:96!</p></div>
