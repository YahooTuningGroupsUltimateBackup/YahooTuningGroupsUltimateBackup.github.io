I understand<br/>you&apos;re thinking of an interval like 5:4, but 5:4 is no more otonal<br/>than utonal. From an otonal perspective, it&apos;s the fourth and fifth<br/>harmonics, with the fourth harmonic octave equivalent to, and closer<br/>to, the implied fundamental. From a utonal perspective, it&apos;s the<br/>fourth and fifth subharmonics, with the fourth subharmonic octave<br/>equivalent to, and closer to, the guide tone. Partch, who introduced<br/>the terms otonal and utonal, makes it very clear that any ratio is<br/>equally otonal and utonal, and it is only with triads and larger<br/>chords where a more otonal or more utonal character can be discerned.</p><p>Not that I believe in duality, but the terms otonal and utonal do<br/>relate to a dualistic perspective, and I think it would be best to<br/>avoid clouding their meaning.</p></div><h3>Paul Erlich &#x3C;paul@stretch-music.com&#x3E;</h3><span>5/27/2001 10:30:13 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In tuning@y..., BVAL@I... wrote:</p><p>&gt; otonal dyads</p><p>Hi Bob, I&apos;m being a complete anal-retentive picky doofus, but see my<br/>last message to Dan on this subject. Partch was nice enough to give<br/>us the language we&apos;re speaking; let&apos;s honor his memory by trying to<br/>retain clarity when using it.
