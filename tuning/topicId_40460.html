Usually a loose pin in the bridge.  Most<br/>times, I have been able to completely remove a false beat with a light<br/>tapping down of the string at the bridge or the bridgepin itself.  On a grand<br/>piano, this is very simple and like all instant gratifications, I try this<br/>first.<br/>    I often must accomodate the &quot;false beat&quot; by detuning the other strings of<br/>the unison so that whatever phase relationships I am fecklessly maneuvering<br/>around will cancel, or at least, hide,  the beating.  This sometimes allows<br/>me to produce a clean sounding unison where none really exists, but other<br/>times, I simply end up with a weird note.<br/>   Oddly enough, when the false-beating unison sounds clean, it also may<br/>refuse to sound in-tune with certain intervals.  It may be a fifth that will<br/>not allow an &quot;in-step&quot; progression octaves, or it may be that the double or<br/>triple octave is whacked when the single is bearable.</p></div><h3><a id=40467 href="#40467">ðŸ”—</a>wallyesterpaulrus &#x3C;wallyesterpaulrus@yahoo.com&#x3E;</h3><span>11/1/2002 11:55:28 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In tuning@y..., a440a@a... wrote:<br/>&gt;  Carl Lumma wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt; On a loosely-related topic, sometimes a single string develops<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt; what are called false beats -- a deformation in the metal<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt; moves a node or some such, and the string by itself will beat.<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt; Sometimes, this can be completely tuned out by changing the<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt; tuning of another unison string in the group.
