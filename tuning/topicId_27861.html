Then figure out by hand<br/>which scale degree becomes which under your transformation and use<br/>this to change keyboard mapping A into keyboard mapping B. Then<br/>retune MIDI file A with the same scale and keyboard mapping B to<br/>produce MIDI file C which is your transformed piece.</p><p>Manuel</p></div><h3><a id=27912 href="#27912">ðŸ”—</a>genewardsmith@juno.com</h3><span>9/6/2001 10:37:09 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In tuning@y..., &lt;manuel.op.de.coul@e...&gt; wrote:</p><p>&gt; Gene wrote:<br/>&gt; &gt;But the scale may have nothing to do with the retuning in question.<br/>&gt; &gt;Suppose I have a scale<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;1 - 9/8 - 6/5 - 5/4 - 4/3 - 3/2 - 8/5 - 9/5 - 15/8 - (2),<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;and I have written a piece of music in it.
