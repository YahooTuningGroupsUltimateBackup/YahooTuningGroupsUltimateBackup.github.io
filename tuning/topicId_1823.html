A very few musicians will insist on the best<br/>intonation and maintain their instruments to play in that intonation while<br/>the vast majority either get by without giving the matter a lot of thought<br/>or even could care less. I would wager that the Siberian piano tuning<br/>recently described is closer to the norm than one of Ed Foote&apos;s<br/>masterpieces.

In the<br/>popular Arabesque repertoire, some saz players get by with a 14-tone subset<br/>of the 17, although this is generally heard as a restriction.

It is only in Turkey -- the<br/>&gt; &gt;major<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt;Islamicate country closest culturally to Europe -- where non-tempered<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt;tunings have maintained their monopoly in both classical, folk, and<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt;arabesque repertoires.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;Though I think Daniel&apos;s right, it should be mentioned that Turkish<br/>&gt; &gt;theory recognizes a division of the octave into 53 equal parts. However,<br/>&gt; &gt;the difference between 53-equal and Just/Pythagorean versions of Turkish<br/>&gt; &gt;scales is exceedingly small -- on the order of 0.1 to 1 cent -- far<br/>&gt; &gt;smaller than the deviations that would occur in even the most ideal<br/>&gt; &gt;musical circumstances. I&apos;ve played on a Turkish saz with very unevenly<br/>&gt; &gt;spaced frets but the smallest intervals were eighth-tones (approximately<br/>&gt; &gt;1/53 octave) and these tended to occur in pairs, dividing in half the<br/>&gt; &gt;second smallest interval (quartertones or 2/53 octave). The placing of<br/>&gt; &gt;these frets was surely too approximate to distinguish between 53-equal<br/>&gt; &gt;and JI/Pythagorean (by the latter I could mean either JI extended much<br/>&gt; &gt;farther along the 3-axis than the 5-axis, or Pythagorean with schismatic<br/>&gt; &gt;approximations to 5-limit intervals).<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>&gt; &gt;Start a new hobby.

The most recent model was<br/>&gt; proposed by Huseyin Sadettin Arel where the octave is partitioned into 24<br/>&gt; unequal sub-intervals.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I am trying to determine the nature of the modal scales by making direct<br/>&gt; measurements<br/>&gt; on improvisations given by indisputable master musicians coming from the<br/>&gt; &apos;dergah&apos; tradition.</p><p>As I stated in another post I have been told that there are regional tuning<br/>differences of all kinds despite the fact that the tunings share the same<br/>theoretical scale</p><p>&gt; My findings are several light years away from the 24<br/>&gt; unequally tempered deterministic model suggested by Arel and company . The<br/>&gt; &apos;scales&apos; that are emerging from my research are not even deterministic.<br/>&gt; Instead, they are sound clusters along the pitch axis in the form of<br/>&gt; distributions with statistical characteristics. In view of my findings so<br/>&gt; far, I am inclined to think a search for a &apos;magic&apos; deterministic scale is<br/>&gt; going to be a futile attempt on the part of the researchers.<br/>&gt; Dr. Can Akkoc<br/>&gt; Alabama School of Mathematics and Science<br/>&gt; 1255 Dauphin Street<br/>&gt; Mobile, AL 36604<br/>&gt; USA</p><p>-- Kraig Grady<br/>North American Embassy of Anaphoria Island<br/><a href="http://www.anaphoria.com">www.anaphoria.com</a></p></div><h3><a id=1845 href="#1845">ðŸ”—</a>Can Akkoc &#x3C;akkoc@xxxx.xxxx&#x3E;</h3><span>3/18/1999 10:53:02 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>At 18:22 3/17/99 -0500, you wrote:<br/>&gt;From: Daniel Wolf &lt;<a href="mailto:DJWOLF_MATERIAL@compuserve.com">DJWOLF_MATERIAL@compuserve.com</a>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;Dr. Akkoc is probably describing the same statistical situation you will<br/>&gt;find in most music cultures.

In a<br/>typical improvisation the musician seems to be using scales that are<br/>inspired at the spur of the moment depending, among others, on the<br/>spiritual state he/she is in, where the music has been before coming to<br/>that particular point in the improvisation, the evolution the improvisation<br/>has gone through since the beginning, etc. It appears musical scales have<br/>&apos;memory&apos; which allows them to evolve in time. However, the situation is not<br/>chaotic at all. There seems to be non deterministic (stochastic) patterns<br/>which carry the &apos;finger print&apos; or &apos;genetic code&apos; for the underlying maqam.<br/>A master musician is capable of recognizing the finger print after hearing<br/>a few sounds no matter how chaotic or random they may sound to a pedestrian.</p><p>Since the musicians seem to be creating their own non-deterministic<br/>stochastic scales in the form of distributions, why not make an attempt to<br/>construct mathematical characterizations in a stochastic setting? An<br/>analogy could be that of someone trying very hard to make a stream flow in<br/>a user-prescribed river bed, while the rives wants to meander and deviate<br/>from the pre-assigned bed, sometimes displaying significant variations,<br/>while trying to carve its own.</p><p>I appreciate Mr. Wolf taking time to inform the people in this circle about<br/>trends in Turkish music, and look forward to more interaction along this<br/>venue. Since music is a universal endeavour, there must be interconnections<br/>linking all musics on this planet in some mysterious way.</p><p>Regards,<br/>Dr. Can Akkoc<br/>Alabama School of Mathematics and Science<br/>1255 Dauphin Street<br/>Mobile, AL 36604<br/>USA</p><p>Phone:  (334) 441-2126<br/>  Fax:  (334) 441-3290<br/>  Web:  <a href="http://199.20.31.100/GIFT/">http://199.20.31.100/GIFT/</a></p></div>
