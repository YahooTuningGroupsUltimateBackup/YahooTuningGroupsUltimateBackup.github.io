Did you write within the ranges<br/>of the quartet instruments?  Did you give any player a chord<br/>that can&apos;t be played?  Did you write a ton of phrases that<br/>require awkward bowing?  Do your melodic jumps serve the<br/>glissandi and portamenti that naturally arise in stringed-<br/>instrument phrasing?  Did you fail to use any of the special<br/>effects that string instruments are capable of (tremelo,<br/>pizzicato, etc. etc.)?</p><p>-Carl</p></div><h3><a id=64068 href="#64068">ðŸ”—</a>Carl Lumma &#x3C;clumma@yahoo.com&#x3E;</h3><span>2/6/2006 7:33:24 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>&gt; &gt; We have a fully-functional polyphonic<br/>&gt; &gt; microtonal instrument: the guitar.
