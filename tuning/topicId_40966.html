Instead,<br/>they change the pitch bend range, and also remap all the pitch bends<br/>in the file in accordance with the new range.</p><p>One could perhaps imagine that maybe there are two parts<br/>to it - a pre-processor and the player itself, so that the<br/>output for the other player has been through the pre-processor first</p><p>But then, if it is like that, why does it get changed to a range<br/>which doesn&apos;t match up with their documentation for Quicktime?</p><p>Anyway I did sone measurements using FFT - and it was within around half a cent<br/>or so of the correct pitches for a 30 second major chord, so not too bad<br/>for a wavetable soft synth.</p><p>Robert</p></div>
