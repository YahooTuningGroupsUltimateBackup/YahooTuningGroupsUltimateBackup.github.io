That gets<br/>you up to 17 notes, on a gamut ranging from Gb to A#. You<br/>then need to add B#/Cb to be between B and C, and E#/Fb to<br/>be between E and F. Hence, you split all the black keys,<br/>and add an extra black key between E and F, and B and C.<br/>I think this would make more sense to keyboardists--any<br/>keyboard players want to comment?</p></div><h3>Gene Ward Smith &#x3C;genewardsmith@sbcglobal.net&#x3E;</h3><span>3/29/2007 2:51:00 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;Aaron Krister Johnson&quot; &lt;aaron@...&gt;<br/>wrote:</p><p>&gt; Any thoughts?</p><p>Sorry, I didn&apos;t see the subject line.
