But, it&apos;s<br/>sure a big world of music, with lots of viewpoints, which is fine with<br/>me...I have been scrolling through the list a lot, recently, but<br/>obviously, some folks are really into the current threads. And, I don&apos;t<br/>care if there&apos;s a bunch of tuning lists...seems like a healthy sign;<br/>maybe this movement is really growing and diversifying...nothing wrong<br/>with that.<br/>   What&apos;s meaningful to me? Well, theory can surely spark real musical<br/>sounds, so I&apos;m hoping those who are really into these new scale<br/>discoveries will whomp our booties with profound music soon, and for<br/>years to come. If not, then it is of little meaning to me. For me,<br/>practical means that I&apos;ve just spent the last 2 and 1/2 months playing<br/>34 tone guitar in a play, that has been seen/heard by thousands of<br/>folks; it means that I have a new microtonal CD coming out in the next<br/>few months, my 4th (and a 12 tone, jazz CD too...); it means that I have<br/>plans for many more, plans which will be put into reality as soon as the<br/>$$$ comes around....which I know it will, sooner or later. Practical<br/>means finding ways to increase my understanding of not only tunings, but<br/>the art of composition, and the technical/imaginative skills I need to<br/>create what I hear...and that, I hate to say, has always been the<br/>weakest part of a lot of microtonal music I&apos;ve heard over the years. In<br/>fact, imagination is in pretty short supply these days, in almost every<br/>category of life on this planet...it would be nice to see that change. I<br/>say folks should follow their passions, whether theory or performance,<br/>and live full, honorable lives...what else is there?</p><p>Hstick</p></div>
