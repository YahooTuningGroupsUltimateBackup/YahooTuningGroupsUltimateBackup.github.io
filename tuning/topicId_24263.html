I&apos;m a fan of Novaro too. BTW,<br/>he also wrote a short work around 1927 which Mark Rankin was able to<br/>track down at the Library of Congress ( ML3805.N69). It&apos;s titled&quot;<br/>Systema Natural base del Natura-Aproximado.&quot; Among other treasures, it<br/>includes a scale identical to the 9-limit Tonality Diamond, constructed<br/>from the union of all &apos;modes&apos; of the series 1/1 9/8 5/4 3/2 7/4 2/1 plus<br/>a couple of &quot;secondary ratios&quot; 16/15 and 21/20 and their inversions to<br/>produce a 23-tone scale.</p><p>In Systema Natural de la Musica, he even describes his invention of a<br/>mechanical finger to play the keyboard. Truly a remarkable inventor.</p><p>--John</p></div><h3><a id=74883 href="#74883">ðŸ”—</a>John Chalmers &#x3C;JHCHALMERS@UCSD.EDU&#x3E;</h3><span>1/16/2008 9:37:42 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>It was the 1953 book that I saw in Carrillo&apos;s home.</p><p>My understanding is that Novaro self-published his books, even setting the type himself.</p><p>Carrillo became very well-connected in Mexican society-- he was invited to play violin at some graduation ceremony and the President of Mexico got him a scholarship to study music in Europe. IIRC, it was at that period that he discovered the &quot;13th tone.&quot; His son Nabor was head of the Mexican Atomic Energy Commission and Julia&apos;n himself held important positions in Mexican musical life. I&apos;m sorry that I don&apos;t recall the details of his life, but he came a long way from being a poor Indian boy in San Luis Poto&apos;si.</p><p>--John</p></div>
