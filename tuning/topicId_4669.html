A 12-note keyboard does not allow this<br/>feature to be exploited fully in even one key without encountering wolves<br/>(e.g., the B-F# in D major).

One string that all the<br/>keys operate plus an extra string to be plucked as a drone. Assuming it<br/>existed historically it would have been circa 1400, and Pythagorean tuning<br/>is the received wisdom for that. But in addition, i discovered a wonderful<br/>note of simplicity: using Pythagirean tuning, all the tangent placements<br/>could be determined using only a pair of dividers!</p><p>Judith Conrad, Clavichord Player (<a href="mailto:jconrad@tiac.net">jconrad@tiac.net</a>)<br/>Music Minister, Calvary Baptist Church, Providence, RI<br/>Director of Fall River Fipple Fluters<br/>Piano and Harpsichord Tuner-Technician</p></div><h3>D.Stearns &#x3C;stearns@xxxxxxx.xxxx&#x3E;</h3><span>9/7/1999 8:04:42 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>[Johnny Reinhard:]<br/>&gt; The AFMM is now planning to record Joshua Pierce playing the Concord<br/>Sonata on 3 Discklaviers (Yamaha) to get the full range of<br/>intonational implications.

I&apos;m really interested to know the (exact)<br/>process (or general philosophy) your using to assign specific<br/>intervals to &quot;the full range of intonational implications&quot; in a piece<br/>like the Concord...
