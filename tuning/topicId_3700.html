Sadly, what he had to tell me doesn&apos;t make the<br/>LA boys look too hot. Basically, when this man attempted to chat with<br/>some of the performers after the show, he felt that they were<br/>uninterested in talking to him, and seemed rather elitist...he said they<br/>kept to themselves, and were not interested in talking about their music<br/>or the tunings involved. He said he left depressed, and with a bad<br/>feeling about the scene in LA. And this is a man who has a real interest<br/>in learning about the world of tunings, the type of guy who wants to be<br/>involved as a performer (he is a musician, with an involvement in<br/>Chinese music).<br/>    Remember, this is his opinion, formulated on his experience at the<br/>Microfest...I don&apos;t feel he had any axe to grind; he genuinely was<br/>disappointed at the response he got. This bums me out immensely...first,<br/>elitism of any kind, in any field, sucks...second, I hate to hear of<br/>such an occurrence in the small world of microtones because we need all<br/>the help we can get to make this happen on a wider scale. And, if this<br/>dude was depressed, it&apos;s likely that others have had the same sort of<br/>experience as well. Too bad.<br/>   Also, a smaller point...he said no one talked about the tunings they<br/>used, or any of the theory behind why they did what they did...he was<br/>interested in learning about what was happening, but came away with<br/>little new knowledge. I put this post up as a public service to my<br/>fellow microtonalists, so perhaps we can avoid alienating people in the<br/>future at our gigs...Hstick</p></div><h3><a id=3706 href="#3706">ðŸ”—</a>David Beardsley &#x3C;xouoxno@xxxx.xxxx&#x3E;</h3><span>6/21/1999 12:24:56 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>I wasn&apos;t in LA but all the Microtonalists I know in California<br/>have been good to me.

At<br/>the first concert, I hung around and talked to several composers and<br/>performers. They were quite friendly and happy to answer questions. I<br/>remember a group of people asking questions of John Schneider until he had<br/>to excuse himself to pack up. After the second concert, I talked to several<br/>interested people, and I saw that the other composers did as well. I am<br/>genuinely perplexed because, even allowing for my involvement and<br/>acquaintance with some others involved, I could hardly have had a more<br/>different impression than your friend.</p><p>As far as the details of the tunings, program notes were more extensive<br/>than many concerts that I attend. Writers of program notes walk a line<br/>between turning off the layperson by being too technical (or giving the<br/>false impression that that&apos;s what the music is &quot;about&quot;) and satisfying the<br/>curiosity of the specialist or curious novice.</p><p>Personally, I prefer to err on the side of the former, in part because I<br/>don&apos;t want people to think I&apos;m snooty or elitist! A impenetrable series of<br/>numbers and technical words just give many people more reason to think<br/>we&apos;re a self-ordained priesthood churning out esoterica from arcane<br/>formulas. And why just tuning? There are at least as many technical details<br/>I could talk about in my music in terms of rhythm, mode, non-West<br/>influences, etc.</p><p>For the specialist, I have already written about the tuning and other<br/>particulars associated with the piece of mine that was performed. That info<br/>can be found at: <a href="http://www2.hmc.edu/~alves/pleng.html">http://www2.hmc.edu/~alves/pleng.html</a>. Kraig has also<br/>posted much information about his music, and John Schneider published the<br/>details of his experience with Barstow. If your friend has any questions or<br/>would like to discuss my piece, I would be more than happy to correspond<br/>with him. If you or anyone else has any suggestions about how to avoid<br/>giving such false impressions or improving microtonal concerts, I would be<br/>happy to discuss those as well.</p><p>Bill</p><p>^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^<br/>^ Bill Alves                                      email: <a href="mailto:alves@hmc.edu">alves@hmc.edu</a> ^<br/>^ Harvey Mudd College                 URL: <a href="http://www2.hmc.edu/~alves/">http://www2.hmc.edu/~alves/</a> ^<br/>^ 301 E.
