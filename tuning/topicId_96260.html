Perhaps &quot;semitonal&quot; is a good<br/>word for these types of structures. &quot;Quasi-rooted&quot; triads are an<br/>interesting class of these sonorities. A triad like 10:12:15 is<br/>quasi-rooted; it sounds like it refers to 5 more 1. These triads tend<br/>to resolve to a certain note, but don&apos;t really fully &quot;make sense,&quot; or<br/>resolve fully; they&apos;re a bit higher in entropy and I believe related<br/>to the perception of &quot;minorness.&quot; At the very least they sound really<br/>complex and interesting.</p><p>An abstract extension of the concept of the quasi-rooted triad, and a<br/>technique that generates loads of semi-tonal sounds right off the bat,<br/>is to use the harmonic series as a patchwork quilt. You start with a<br/>structure, take a chunk out of it, and replace it with another chunk<br/>that has the same outer dyad. I&apos;ll give you an example:</p><p>- Start with 2:4:6:8:9:10:11:12.<br/>- Now take that 8:9:10:11:12 chunk - see how the outer dyad is a 3/2?<br/>- Now replace that chunk with another chunk of the harmonic series in<br/>which the outer dyad is also a 3/2.<br/>- Let&apos;s try the following options: 6:7:8:9, 10:11:12:13:14:15,<br/>14:16:17:19:21, 18:20:22:24:27. Pop the 8:9:10:11:12 out and snap<br/>these pieces in there instead.<br/>- This leads to the following chords: 3:6:9:12:14:16:18,<br/>5:10:15:20:22:24:26:28:30, 7:14:21:28:32:34:38:42, and<br/>9:18:27:36:40:44:48:54.<br/>- Note the very subtle difference between second and third one.<br/>- If you tend to hate cluster chords and don&apos;t like critical band<br/>effects, feel free to take subsets of the above chords.</p><p>Those sounded fairly familiar, so here&apos;s a more xenharmonic example:<br/>- Start with 2:4:6:7:8<br/>- Check out the 6:7:8, note that it has an outer dyad of 4/3.<br/>- Now pop that 6:7:8 out and give it a 9:10:11:12 transplant. Try<br/>12:13:15:16 too. Try 21:23:25:28 and 21:23:26:28 too.<br/>- This gives you 3:6:9:10:11:12, 4:8:12:13:14:15:16 (this one is<br/>actually rooted, can you hear the difference?), 7:14:21:23:25:28, and<br/>7:14:21:23:26:28.</p><p>Some interesting neutral sounds here. Can we make &quot;sad&quot; sounds? Let&apos;s<br/>see if we can&apos;t create a &quot;minor&quot; sounding chord that actually is as<br/>sad as 5-limit minor:<br/>- Start with 2:4:7:8:9:11.<br/>- Go back to the original chord, and this time replace the 7:8:9:11<br/>with 14:16:19:22. This is 4:8:14:16:19:22. I flip that 19 back and<br/>forth from 18 and hear major, minor, major, minor.<br/>- Go back to the original chord, and this time replace the 7:8:9:11<br/>with 14:17:18:20:22. This is 4:8:14:16:17:19:22. A bit less restful.<br/>- Go back to the original chord, and this time replace the 7:8:9:11<br/>with 504:576:693:792. This is the utonal inverse of 7:9:11, with the 8<br/>left alone. This is 144:288:504:576:616:792. To me this sounds pretty<br/>dissonant.<br/>- Go back to the original chord, and this time replace the 7:8:9:11<br/>with 504:616:693:792. This is utonal inverse of 7:8:9:11 in which 8 is<br/>flipped upside down as well. This is 144:288:504:616:693:792. Still<br/>sounds somewhat minor to me. It&apos;s interesting to compare this to<br/>4:8:14:16:19:22 and see how they relate.</p><p>I find these sounds very interesting. They produce xenharmonic &quot;minor&quot;<br/>chords, in an abstract sense, as is 4:7:9:11 a xenharmonic &quot;major&quot;<br/>chord. They differ in &quot;minorness&quot; and some are more sad-sounding than<br/>others. There are probably ways to create chords that feel similar<br/>that don&apos;t involve this particular &quot;patchwork&quot; approach as well.</p><p>In this sense, both 10:15:20:24:30 and 10:15:20:26:30 can be thought<br/>of as semitonal sonorities that build off of 2:3:4:6, where the 4:6 is<br/>replaced with 10:12:15 and 10:13:15. The 2:3:4:6 resolves to one VF,<br/>and the 10:12:15 and 10:13:15 don&apos;t fit perfectly into that. Of the<br/>two, 10:12:15 sounds more &quot;minor&quot; to me. This could be because it&apos;s<br/>higher in entropy, or because it&apos;s also the utonal version of 4:5:6.<br/>You decide.</p><p>-Mike</p></div>
