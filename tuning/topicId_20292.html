Not wacky, not wild, completely ordinary<br/>in appearance with a gentle bulge.</p><p>But appearences can be deceiving.</p><p>It is definately extremely harmonic sounding.<br/>So I learned something because I didn&apos;t think I would hear<br/>much of that at such a high limit. I also was surprised<br/>that the &apos;just&apos; feel of the scale was strongly felt even<br/>across wide expanses of notes (surprising to me since the<br/>harmonic series switches directions and the repeat is at<br/>the oddball interval of 261/169).</p><p>Melodies are obviously very easy with this scale with<br/>all semitones, but I didn&apos;t expect how extremely<br/>resonant they would sound as the decays of the notes<br/>overlap. The sound it made reminded me of the sound of<br/>a floor harp/zither I have, where the strings are<br/>sympathetically resonanting with one another. That type of<br/>sound is really present in this scale.</p><p>At first I got a kind of middle-eastern feel melodically<br/>but then it seemed kind of Irish but then it seemed both<br/>and neither.</p><p>There are a lot of very consonant chords in here and<br/>ones that work well with whatever melody are easy to<br/>find. I found that strumming like a harp on a plucky<br/>patch with enough decay worked well.</p><p>It&apos;s a very string instrument oriented tuning it seems:<br/>harp, piano...</p><p>My brain got kind of a feeling on the top of it.<br/>The same weird feeling when looking at a 3D random dot<br/>stereogram -- your brain is perceiving something,<br/>but can tell that something is not right, it is being<br/>fooled.</p><p>I think it is because the harmonic series points in<br/>different directions in different areas. The brain<br/>recognizes something going on there and is able to<br/>partially assemble it -- but at a certain point it can&apos;t<br/>fit it all together. It&apos;s perceptually confounded. So it<br/>registers the &apos;very harmonic&apos; awareness but there is<br/>cognitive dissonance because the fundamental is<br/>inconsistent. With something like 12tET, the sound is so<br/>inharmonic that the brain doesn&apos;t even try to coalesce the<br/>sounds of any chord. But with this 19-limit harmonic<br/>mirror, it has so much &apos;harmony&apos; that the brain says &quot;I<br/>know what this is!&quot; and tries to coalesce the sounds but<br/>can&apos;t do it completely and can&apos;t figure out what is wrong<br/>so you get this feeling of dissonance but it is happening<br/>not in the audio dissonance area but in some sort of<br/>perceptual dissonance area and that is the weird feeling I<br/>am having.</p><p>So there you go. Very interesting and a quite<br/>useful scale. Thanks! Once again I find myself<br/>challenged, confounded, respectful, and<br/>intrigued by your scales.</p><p>- Jeff</p></div>
