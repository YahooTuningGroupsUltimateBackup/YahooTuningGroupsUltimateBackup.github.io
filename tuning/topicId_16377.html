For instance, what would be the maximally beating point<br/>&gt;between 6/5 and 5/4, or between 4/3 and 3/2? Is there, or could there<br/>&gt;be, a number of them between certain intervals?</p><p>&gt;I realize this would somewhat be dependent upon the timbre being<br/>&gt;used, but let&apos;s say for ease of discussion, it&apos;s a harmonic timbre<br/>&gt;under consideration. Or perhaps it&apos;s better to consider only a sine<br/>&gt;wave?</p><p>Of course, for a sine wave the question is meaningless -- no beats will<br/>occur at all, unless the dyad is played in a low register and the tones<br/>actually beat against one another, in which case the beating will simply<br/>decrease smoothly as one moves from 6/5 to 5/4. For a harmonic timbre,<br/>though, the answer depends on both the amplitudes of the partials, and on<br/>how you define &quot;maximally beating&quot; (presumably each instance of beating is<br/>to be weighted by both its amplitude and rate, but the details of the<br/>calculation are pretty subjective, though a proper treatment will have to<br/>take into account the critical band of the human ear, which varies according<br/>to register).</p><p>You may recall the &quot;golden mediant&quot; Margo and Dave K. described some time<br/>ago:</p><p><a href="http://www.egroups.com/message/tuning/12915">http://www.egroups.com/message/tuning/12915</a></p><p>&quot;As a solution of the above quadratic one finds that Phi is (sqrt(5)+1)/2 or<br/>approximately 1.61803398874989484820459.</p><p>Thus we can find the Golden Mediant for the region of maximum complexity<br/>between two simpler intervals by setting x=1, y=Phi. For two such interval<br/>ratios i:j and m:n where i:j is the simpler ratio:</p><p>                                        (i + Phi * m)<br/>         GoldenMediant(i/j, m/n)    =   -------------<br/>                                        (j + Phi * n) &quot;</p><p>That could be a useful catch-all in many situations -- in other words it<br/>usually (but not always) will be close to the right answer regardless of<br/>specifics.</p><p>So, for your 6/5 - 5/4 example, the golden mediant is about 339.3439 cents,<br/>and for your 4/3 - 3/2 example, the golden mediant is about 560.0666 cents.</p></div><h3>Dave Keenan &#x3C;D.KEENAN@UQ.NET.AU&#x3E;</h3><span>12/9/2000 6:23:18 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Good question Jacky.</p><p>Paul, thanks for pointing folks to Margo&apos;s and my post.</p><p>Just a reminder that Margo and I later agreed that it should be called<br/>the &quot;noble mediant&quot;. Note that the most complex of the two ratios is<br/>always the one that gets &quot;phi-weighted&quot;. And as Paul mentioned, it<br/>doesn&apos;t always work. Notably it fails near the unison, octave and<br/>perfect fifth.</p><p>The noble mediant formula of course gives a frequency ratio, not cents<br/>or a fraction of an octave, so to get cents you still have to apply<br/>ln(x)/ln(2)*1200 to the result. Any decimal places in such cent values<br/>are totally irrelevant, as are most of the decimal places we gave for<br/>phi.</p><p>Regards,</p></div>
