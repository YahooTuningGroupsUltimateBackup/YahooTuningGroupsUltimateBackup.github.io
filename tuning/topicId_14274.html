But, to review the<br/>process and perhaps clarify,</p><p>   . Before any springs are generated, I decide what target tuning to<br/>     use at each moment in time.  To pick an ideal target tuning, each<br/>     tuning file in each possible key is compared against the set of<br/>     notes now sounding.  Chords like, say, augmented triads show great<br/>     pain on the &quot;backside&quot; of JI, and so are shunted into 12-tET<br/>     tuning, where major thirds are painful but consistent.</p><p>   . The program used to stop there, but around Jan 2000 I added a<br/>     spring layer of processing.  What I&apos;ve done up till now is, when<br/>     a 12-tET tuning is chosen as best, 12-tET was also the target<br/>     tuning of the vertical springs.  Now it&apos;s not.  (I leave minor<br/>     seconds, major seconds, and tritones at 12-tET target tunings,<br/>     100, 200 and 600 cents respectively, but reduce the importance of<br/>     exact adherence to boost the other intervals&apos; influence).</p><p>If it&apos;s confusing what I&apos;m saying about the tuning files, just visualize<br/>that they give an offset for each pitch12, with dyad tuning implied<br/>from that.
