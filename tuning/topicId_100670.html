It was found that all of them have the same value and close to 3/2. That is, 12 fifths per TRUE octave. Other basic relations were also calculated.</p><p>Now I know that this finding will at least improve the musical expression everywhere.</p><p>You are the skilled people needed to extend and give out its musical properties.</p><p>I will tune the piano the coming July 16.</p><p>Full information follows.</p><p>C.
