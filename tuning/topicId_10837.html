I recall meeting one composer, I think his name was Bruce<br/>&gt;Hemmingway, who told me that his goal, and one that he thought all<br/>&gt;composers should share, was to create pieces that would hold a listener&apos;s<br/>&gt;interest for more than four minutes. He admitted that he had never done<br/>&gt;it, and didn&apos;t think any contemporary composer in the electronic/computer<br/>&gt;realm had either.  This &quot;four-minute rule&quot; is one I subscribe to, and I am<br/>&gt;reminded of some of the rather lengthy symphonic pieces that hold my<br/>&gt;interest, for example, the Shostakovich 11th symphony, which, plus or<br/>&gt;minus some conductors&apos; tempo digressions, runs about 65 minutes. So, can<br/>&gt;someone recommend a piece over four minutes that is xenharmonic or<br/>&gt;xentonal (or both) that holds *your* interest? Surely in the years since<br/>&gt;1977, someone has written something.</p><p>My number-one recommendation is going to be Marcus Hobbs&apos; _From on High_.<br/>If you like electronic music, you will love it.  I promise.  It may even<br/>get you into groove.  <a href="http://www.marcussatellite.com/">http://www.marcussatellite.com/</a></p><p>From the catagory of more &apos;involved&apos; music, David Doty has no fewer than<br/>six cuts on his album _Uncommon Practice_ which are over four minutes.<br/><a href="http://www.syntonic-rec.com/">http://www.syntonic-rec.com/</a></p><p>Does it have to be electronic?  Paul E. already mentioned Partch and the<br/>Catler Bros. (both of which I whole-heartedly second).  I believe<br/>Haverstick has at least one 4+ cut on _Acoustic Stick_.</p><p>How fast do you need to be held?  Michael Harrison and Kraig Grady both<br/>have astonishing long works in JI (see _Ancient Worlds_ and _The Creation<br/>of the Worlds_ respectively).<br/><a href="http://www.newalbion.com/NA042/">http://www.newalbion.com/NA042/</a><br/>(E-mail Kraig off-list for info.)</p><p>Also in the &apos;minimal&apos; catagory, but back to the electronic realm (and<br/>with video!), Bill Alves&apos; recent post should be investigated.<br/><a href="http://www2.hmc.edu/~alves/hiway70.html">http://www2.hmc.edu/~alves/hiway70.html</a> (one of three!)  Lastly, for<br/>instant gratification, and available only in mp3, try Prent Rodgers&apos;<br/>stuff: <a href="http://32.97.166.75/music1/">http://32.97.166.75/music1/</a> (speaking into the air, Rock10, and<br/>Mino9 are all over 4 minutes).</p><p>Hard to believe, but it&apos;s all worth a listen.  Bet you didn&apos;t bargain<br/>for _that_!  :)  Incidentally, I love Shosty 11!</p><p>-=Carl</p></div>
