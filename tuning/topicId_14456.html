But what is tuning<br/>theory: some abstraction?  No, it is an attempt to figure out how to<br/>wrest the most possible beauty out of music.  I do not think of myself<br/>as a &quot;theorist&quot; in any case; I am someone who loves music and wants to<br/>maximize my enjoyment of a given performance of it.  Getting chords to<br/>tend toward JI is a big help, as far as my perception goes.  You are<br/>right to say that tuning theory does not focus on any one composer vs.<br/>another, but certain tradeoffs are applicable to many composers.</p><p>Of course, I don&apos;t deny that discordance is an integral part of some<br/>pieces of music; these would be ill-served by attempts to move their<br/>tuning toward JI.  As far as I can tell, however, this does not apply to<br/>Mozart or to many other composers over a broad range of time.</p><p>JdL</p></div><h3><a id=14516 href="#14516">ðŸ”—</a>Joseph Pehrson &#x3C;pehrson@pubmedia.com&#x3E;</h3><span>10/17/2000 12:34:16 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@egroups.com">tuning@egroups.com</a>, &quot;John A. deLaubenfels&quot; &lt;jdl@a...&gt; wrote:</p><p><a href="http://www.egroups.com/message/tuning/14498">http://www.egroups.com/message/tuning/14498</a></p><p>&gt; I do agree that the greatest achievements of non-12-tET music have<br/>yet to come; like probably most on this list, I have a desire to<br/>participate in generating new compositions to wow the world.

The total experience of being an<br/>original listener of Mozart&apos;s,  I don&apos;t want.<br/>   I want it in a clean mix, through a set of balanced speakers and plenty of<br/>RMS, with the fridge nearby.  Or a comfortable chair in a cool auditorium,<br/>listening to someone maneuver a big Steinway through the repertoire.  I only<br/>want the good parts of the score.<br/>   It was an epiphany many years ago, when here in Nashville, I walked over<br/>to the Parthenon one night.  (We have a full scale replication of the<br/>original here),  The lights were on, making the special surface material look<br/>like the original did in daylight.  I realized that I was looking at the<br/>western end of the building from a small hill,  seeing a perspective that the<br/>original designers, builder, and users had NEVER been privilidged to see.<br/>The building&apos;s perfection was still beautifully evident, even though this<br/>particular perspective hadn&apos;t been available with the original.<br/>     So it may also be with the temperaments. Some would hold that the true<br/>beauty of Mozart requires equal temperament.  I don&apos;t agree, but I don&apos;t need<br/>to.  There are alternatives that are far more descriptive than words.  Today<br/>we can make comparisons that Mozart never had.  We can decide for ourselves<br/>if this or that intonation creates more of an emotional response.  And that<br/>is what I think we are mainly looking for,  the creation of emotional events.<br/> If certain changes in the tempering, coupled with the compositions that<br/>happened at their times, increases the emotional pull, then I begin shoveling<br/>value judgements around.  I have done this with Beethoven, and now Mozart and<br/>the five others,  and am convinced that ET is the lesser tuning for most<br/>piano music.  I will wait to hear what others might get from it.</p><p>&gt;&gt;Since we CANNOT, I believe, listen to ANYTHING of the past with the<br/>ears of the past, why not try different LISTENING LENSES on past<br/>musics??  It will not, ultimately, make any difference, but will only<br/>add to our present experience, since the veracity of the listening OF<br/>THAT TIME is unattainable...&gt;&gt;</p><p>I agree, I like the idea of lenses, so wait till we can talk about the Chopin<br/>#66 we  have recorded on the DeMorgan Temperament!

I personally<br/>worked pretty hard to<br/>get John to listen to and accomodate my views about what is and is<br/>not appropriate for<br/>various composers. Although we have just begun along this path, I<br/>truly believe that<br/>many of the examples John has produced are both faithful to the<br/>composer&apos;s intentions,<br/>and ideal in terms of the tradeoff of harmonic and melodic<br/>considerations. Think of it as<br/>the way a wind, brass, or string ensemble would perform the piece if<br/>they had<br/>superhuman pitch control and sensitivity to prior and future events<br/>in the score.</p><p>The idea of adaptive tuning goes back to Vicentino in 1555, who<br/>proposed the two chains<br/>of 1/4-comma meantone tuning a pure fifth (or equivalently, a pure<br/>minor third, or 1/4<br/>comma) apart. This proposal would never compromise the melodic<br/>integrity of the chain<br/>of identical (in this case, meantone) fifths by more than a<br/>melodically inaudible interval,<br/>1/4-comma, while attaining perfect vertical JI in all triads. To me,<br/>this amounts to audibly<br/>&quot;perfect&quot; tuning within the Renaissance theoretical ideal (as<br/>expressed by, say, Zarlino),<br/>and much of the subsequent repertoire well into the 18th century --<br/>until enharmonic<br/>equivalents began to be used. Though Vicentino&apos;s two-keyboard<br/>implementation was not<br/>practical at the time, with computers (or, perhaps, AFMM performers),<br/>we can acheive<br/>his goals, and even surpass him in cases where his proposal runs into<br/>difficulties.</p><p>I would add a belated comment to John deLaubenfels -- in cases where<br/>a late 15th<br/>through early 18th century piece has more than 12 notated pitches,<br/>his program still<br/>leaves something to be desired relative to Vicentino&apos;s method -- as,<br/>if I recall correctly,<br/>he touched upon when considering 13-pitch schemes (John, what exactly<br/>did you look at<br/>as regards 13 notated pitches -- is it obsolete now)?</p></div><h3><a id=14646 href="#14646">ðŸ”—</a>John A. deLaubenfels &#x3C;jdl@adaptune.com&#x3E;</h3><span>10/19/2000 4:30:02 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>[Johnny Reinhard:]<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt;Granted, we have modern ears (and imaginations, and tolerances), but<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt;it does not negate what the appropriate tuning offers the music.

The tuning of the<br/>&gt; open strings is completely &apos;user-definable&apos;, but Robin generally<br/>&gt; uses tunings which produce a nice rich JI chord on the open strings.</p><p>To the best of my recollection, he tuned this particular &apos;Jinto&apos;<br/>guitar to a pseudo-JI &apos;major 9th&apos; chord, giving the following<br/>fretboard tuning for the first 14 frets (in Semitones):</p><p>open str: 0.00      3.85      7.00     10.85    12+2.00   12+5.85</p><p>0.70       0.70      4.55      7.70     11.55  12+ 2.70  12+ 6.55<br/>1.15       1.85      5.70      8.85  12+ 0.70  12+ 3.85  12+ 7.70<br/>0.85       2.70      6.55      9.70  12+ 1.55  12+ 4.70  12+ 8.55<br/>1.15       3.85      7.70     10.85  12+ 2.70  12+ 5.85  12+ 9.70<br/>1.15       5.00      8.85  12+ 0.00  12+ 3.85  12+ 7.00  12+10.85<br/>0.85       5.85      9.70  12+ 0.85  12+ 4.70  12+ 7.85  12+11.70<br/>1.15       7.00     10.85  12+ 2.00  12+ 5.85  12+ 9.00  24+ 0.85<br/>0.70       7.70     11.55  12+ 2.70  12+ 6.55  12+ 9.70  24+ 1.55<br/>1.15       8.85  12+ 0.70  12+ 3.85  12+ 7.70  12+10.85  24+ 2.70<br/>0.85       9.70  12+ 1.55  12+ 4.70  12+ 8.55  12+11.70  24+ 3.55<br/>1.15      10.85  12+ 2.70  12+ 5.85  12+ 9.70  24+ 0.85  24+ 4.70<br/>1.15   12+ 0.00  12+ 3.85  12+ 7.00  12+10.85  24+ 2.00  24+ 5.85<br/>0.85   12+ 0.85  12+ 4.70  12+ 7.85  12+11.70  24+ 2.85  24+ 6.70<br/>1.15   12+ 2.00  12+ 5.85  12+ 9.00  24+ 0.85  24+ 4.00  24+ 7.85</p><p>If one *were* to try to tune the open strings to the &apos;regular&apos;<br/>tuning strictly according the notes available on the fretboard,<br/>however, there would be a discrepancy of approximately a comma<br/>on the higher strings, as I illustrate here with a diagram<br/>giving the first 5 frets:</p><p>open:  0.00   5.00    10.00   12+ 3.00  12+ 6.85   12+11.85</p><p>0.70   0.70   5.70     10.70  12+ 3.70  12+ 7.55   24+ 0.55<br/>1.15   1.85   6.85     11.85  12+ 4.85  12+ 8.70   24+ 1.70<br/>0.85   2.70   7.70  12+ 0.70  12+ 5.70  12+ 9.55   24+ 2.55<br/>1.15   3.85   8.85  12+ 1.85  12+ 6.85  12+ 10.70  24+ 3.70<br/>1.15   5.00  10.00  12+ 3.00  12+ 8.00  12+ 11.85  24+ 4.85</p><p>Tuning the 5th string to 12+6.85 Semitones gives a &apos;B&apos; which<br/>is darn close to the 5/4 above the &apos;G&apos;-string, but it&apos;s also<br/>~17 cents flatter than the &apos;B&apos; which would be an &apos;8ve&apos;+ 3/2<br/>above the &apos;low E&apos;-string, and the frets on that &apos;B&apos; string<br/>give a &apos;high-E&apos; which is also ~15 cents flat in relation to<br/>the &apos;low-E&apos;.</p><p>One could certainly tune the open strings to a &apos;regular&apos;<br/>tuning where the &apos;B&apos; is sharper than what the fretboard<br/>gives, and also tune the &apos;high-E&apos; string an exact 2 &apos;8ves&apos;<br/>above the &apos;low-E&apos;, but then you end up with notes that<br/>are unrelated to those on the fretboard (which might not<br/>necessarily be a problem...).</p><p>My guess is that Robin decided on using JI-chord open tunings<br/>at least partly to avoid this kind of thing.</p><p>I haven&apos;t really devoted much time to studying what this guitar<br/>can do, and others guitar players who I&apos;ve shown it to have been<br/>baffled.  I hope to eventually make a webpage about it after I&apos;ve<br/>played it more.</p><p>-monz<br/><a href="http://www.ixpres.com/interval/monzo/homepage.html">http://www.ixpres.com/interval/monzo/homepage.html</a></p></div><h3><a id=14666 href="#14666">ðŸ”—</a>Paul H.
