I also thought it might be Alpha (one of Wendy Carlos&apos; non-octave scales) with octaves added. But I couldn&apos;t get either of those to work out.</p><p>They both seem 22-ish, but that&apos;s not much to go on. I can play along with a 22-ET keyboard, but the notes don&apos;t quite match.

Superpyth, magic, and orwell are the most likely possibilities.</p><p>Orwell has a generator around 271 cents; the 3/1 is divided into 7 equal parts. Magic has a major third as a generator. The other one that might fit with either of these two is superpyth. The generator is a slightly flat fourth (or sharp fifth). But orwell and magic are more accurate temperaments. I suspect if you didn&apos;t like hedgehog for tempering out 50/49, superpyth (which tempers out 64/63) is probably also not one that you&apos;d pick.</p></div><h3>Petr Pa&#x159;&#xED;zek &#x3C;p.parizek@chello.cz&#x3E;</h3><span>12/28/2007 2:15:31 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Herman wrote:</p><p>&gt; They both seem 22-ish, but that&apos;s not much to go on.

The scale in the first melody is one that fits keemun fairly well, but I couldn&apos;t get the harmonic progressions to work. Magic is also a modified 19, which may be why magic seemed like a better fit.</p><p>&gt; OTOH, I found some similarities between hedgehog and 22-EDO, which I never &gt; thought about earlier.<br/>&gt; &gt; PS: What is porcupine?</p><p>Porcupine tempers out 250/243. The generator (around 162 cents) divides the minor sixth into five equal parts.</p><p>Here&apos;s a generator mapping for semisixths (the 5-limit version or sensipent) and porcupine for comparison:</p><p>sensipent [&lt;1, -1, -1], &lt;0, 7, 9]&gt;<br/>porcupine [&lt;1, 2, 3], &lt;0, -3, -5]&gt;</p><p>What this does is describe the mapping of the three prime intervals: 2/1, 3/1, and 5/1; from these you can map any rational interval into a tempered interval. To keep it simple, we can ignore the octaves and look at the last two numbers: it takes 7 generators up to reach a 3/1 (or a 3/2) in sensi, and 9 generators up to reach 5/1 (or 5/4). Porcupine on the other hand has 3 generators down for a 3/2 and 5 generators down for a 5/4.</p></div><h3>Petr Pa&#x159;&#xED;zek &#x3C;p.parizek@chello.cz&#x3E;</h3><span>12/29/2007 2:34:46 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Herman wrote:</p><p>&gt; This seems to be semisixths temperament (a.k.a. sensipent).

Probably didn&apos;t like the URL with the numbers in it or something.</p><p>In any case, the page I mentioned can be found by googling for +hedgehog +keemun. The name of the page is &quot;Seven-limit temperament names&quot;, or &quot;Seven Limit Named Temperaments&quot;. I also mentioned Paul Erlich&apos;s paper (which Dave Keenan mentioned yesterday). Most of the best 5- and 7-limit rank 2 temperaments are listed in Paul&apos;s paper, with the generator mappings and other useful data, but there are a few others that, even though they might not be as good, still have interesting musical uses. Gene&apos;s page, on the other hand, while it lists a huge number of temperaments, only provides the wedgie, which isn&apos;t much to go on. There&apos;s a handful of 11-limit and higher temperaments that have been named, but I don&apos;t know if there&apos;s a convenient list of them anywhere.</p><p>It happens that most useful rank 2 temperaments can be described as combinations of ET&apos;s. Graham Breed has a page which takes two ET&apos;s and finds a generator mapping (<a href="http://x31eq.com/temper/twoet.html">http://x31eq.com/temper/twoet.html</a>). I&apos;ve gone through Gene&apos;s big list and looked up all the wedgies, and most of them were already in a list I have of ET combinations. An ET combination isn&apos;t a unique identifier like the wedgie (many temperaments have more than one possible combination of ETs that generates them), but it&apos;s easier to get a feel for what the temperament might be useful for. About the only useful thing you can get out of a wedgie without a lot of complicated manipulation of the numbers is a general idea of the temperament&apos;s complexity.</p><p>So here&apos;s a list of ET combinations for each of the named temperaments in Gene&apos;s list, with asterisks by those that weren&apos;t in my list. (Keep in mind that some of these may have more than one name.) You can then draw a line on an ET chart like the one on the Tonalsoft web site (<a href="http://tonalsoft.com/enc/e/equal-temperament.aspx">http://tonalsoft.com/enc/e/equal-temperament.aspx</a>) or the one in Paul Erlich&apos;s paper, or plug the numbers into Graham Breed&apos;s temperament finder to get a generator mapping and suggested size for the generator.</p><p>46&amp;53   Amity &lt;&lt;5
