Can you give your definition of near-MOS again, because I thought it was the same thing.</p><p>I think they are the same thing. On the xenharmonic wiki, I called the<br/>new page &quot;near-MOS&quot; because that was the term that I first heard when<br/>Carl introduced the concept to me ages ago. If you were calling it<br/>MODMOS first before I joined the list then let&apos;s change it to that.</p><p>Right now I have near-MOS defined very loosely: any time you start<br/>with an MOS and start chromatically altering notes, that&apos;s a near-MOS<br/>(provided you don&apos;t just alter them to give you another MOS). The idea<br/>is, however, that if you start making too many alterations, your scale<br/>will stop looking like a chromatically altered version of the original<br/>MOS, and start looking like another scale. I haven&apos;t defined any<br/>cutoff for when it stops being a near-MOS of the original scale and<br/>starts being a new scale; what you want to call it is up to you.</p><p>Here&apos;s an example, if you start with 12-tet mixolydian - C D E F G A<br/>Bb C - and you alter the F to F#, giving you mixo #4/lydian dominant,<br/>which is a mode of melodic minor - C D E F# G A Bb C - and then you<br/>decide you also want to sharp the 2, you now end up with C D# E F# G A<br/>Bb C, which is an improper scale that probably makes more sense if<br/>viewed as a subset of the octatonic scale, C C# D# E F# G A Bb C,<br/>which is proper. And this is precisely what jazz musicians tend to do<br/>in this situation: if I&apos;m given a C7#9#11nat13 chord, I&apos;m going to<br/>play the C octatonic scale over that, or else Shelly Berg will fail me<br/>for the semester (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shelly_Berg">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shelly_Berg</a>). So in<br/>this case, the second alteration makes more sense if it&apos;s thought of<br/>as transforming the scale into a subset of the octatonic scale, but<br/>you can still think of it as a near-MOS of meantone if you want. This<br/>situation obviously runs up more often if you&apos;re working within an<br/>equal temperament.</p><p>I&apos;ve just suggested that, as a rough guideline, that if you make more<br/>than two scale alterations to a scale, it&apos;s probably best to start<br/>viewing it as a separate scale instead of a near-MOS. This might be<br/>too restrictive for something like miracle[10], though.</p><p>-Mike</p></div><h3><a id=97034 href="#97034">ðŸ”—</a>cityoftheasleep &#x3C;igliashon@...&#x3E;</h3><span>3/13/2011 11:37:24 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;genewardsmith&quot; &lt;genewardsmith@...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; --- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;lobawad&quot; &lt;lobawad@&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; I&apos;m guess 27, 24, 26, 36.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; If the first one is 27, then it&apos;s possible to produce what strikes me as a Middle Eastern<br/>&gt; sound in 27, which would be interesting to know.<br/>&gt;</p><p>I&apos;ll tell you if it is or not after Mike&apos;s done the test.</p><p>-Igs</p></div><h3><a id=97037 href="#97037">ðŸ”—</a>Mike Battaglia &#x3C;battaglia01@...&#x3E;</h3><span>3/14/2011 12:43:21 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>On Sun, Mar 13, 2011 at 6:47 PM, cityoftheasleep<br/>&lt;igliashon@...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Hi Gang,<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; In my folder in the &quot;files&quot; section, you will find four .mp3 files called &quot;Neutral 1&quot;, &quot;Neutral 2&quot;, &quot;Neutral 3&quot;, and &quot;Neutral 4&quot;.

So it seems that, even as westerners, we are able to discriminate rather fine differences in melodic organization, even absent a drone.  This is good to know!</p><p>However, the point was less about our ability to discriminate and more that all of these tunings sound &quot;vaguely middle eastern&quot; enough that they could work as &quot;landmarks&quot; just as well as 24-EDO, with the expectation being that performers would make the proper intonational adjustments for each maqam.  My hypothesis is that the use of 24-EDO as a landmark has less to do with any superiority of approximation and more to do with its ability to help shoe-horn maqam music into a Western framework.

These are just some short little melodic diddles in a variety of neutral-esque scales, meant to see if people can actually tell by listening how the neutral intervals are tuned. I used four EDO-based scales:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; My guess is:<br/>&gt; 1) 27-EDO<br/>&gt; 2) 24-EDO<br/>&gt; 3) 26-EDO<br/>&gt; 4) 36-EDO<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I made the following charts for reference:<br/>&gt; 24-EDO:  150 200 150 200 150 200 150 - sLsLsLs<br/>&gt; 26-EDO:  138 231 138 186 138 231 138 - sLsMsLs<br/>&gt; 27-EDO:  133 222 133 222 133 222 133 - sLsLsLs<br/>&gt; 36-EDO:  133 233 133 200 133 233 133 - sLsMsLs<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I went by whether that interval in the middle was an M or just another<br/>&gt; L, and also if the first trichord sounded more to me like C Db E or C<br/>&gt; Dv E. I will admit that it was a pretty hard exercise; I&apos;m not all<br/>&gt; that familiar with 26-EDO. In contrast, the 27-EDO one seemed obvious.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; This was fun, although I don&apos;t see how what point this proves about<br/>&gt; maqam intonation - this is kind of like saying that western music<br/>&gt; isn&apos;t in meantone by playing examples in Werckmeister I-IV or<br/>&gt; something. And as far as barging in with a western mentality and<br/>&gt; making a wreck of maqam theory goes, at <a href="http://maqamworld.com">maqamworld.com</a>, which is a<br/>&gt; site that&apos;s maintained by actual maqam practitioners, they just talk<br/>&gt; about using a whole step in both cases, so I don&apos;t know if they&apos;d be<br/>&gt; down to use two different sizes of whole tone. I&apos;m also curious to see<br/>&gt; what they&apos;d make of the examples. But this was a fun exercise, thanks<br/>&gt; for posting this.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; -Mike<br/>&gt;</p></div><h3><a id=97061 href="#97061">ðŸ”—</a>Michael &#x3C;djtrancendance@...&#x3E;</h3><span>3/14/2011 12:11:12 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Igs&gt;&quot;The 36 and the 27 you guys got backwards, and that&apos;s interesting to me, because the 27 is MOS but the 36 is not.&quot;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp; There you go with a hyper-MOS (rank 3, if I have it correctly) in 36 EDO.&nbsp; As you might figure, I&apos;m amused by this, because many of the irregular temperaments I like have 3, 4, and sometimes even 5 interval sizes.&nbsp; Not to say strict two-interval-size MOS is worse than &quot;hyper MOS&quot;...but, rather...I wish people here would consider taking hyper-MOS scales with the same level of seriousness as MOS scales (especially strictly proper hyper MOS scales, which have so many of MOS scales&apos; desirable properties).</p><p>&gt;&quot;My hypothesis is that the use of 24-EDO as a landmark has less to do<br/>with any superiority of approximation and more to do with its ability to<br/> help shoe-horn maqam music into a Western framework.  &quot;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp; My two cents: agreed, 24EDO is &quot;the 12TET of Middle Eastern music&quot;.&nbsp; If we wanted to optimize the accuracy diatonic scale, for example, we would probably be using something like 31EDO instead.&nbsp; Far as optimizing for Maqams and the like (which cover many more different interval types/sizes than Western music), I can easily see how inaccurate 24EDO would be unable to create truly &quot;recognizable&quot; Maqams.</p><p>&gt;&quot;So it seems that, even as westerners, we are able to discriminate<br/>rather fine differences in melodic organization, even absent a drone.<br/>This is good to know!  &quot;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp; If I have it right, this seems to say melody and harmony are linked...and melodic intervals are interpreted by the brain in a way JUST as picky as the way it picks harmonic intervals.&nbsp;</p></div><h3><a id=97062 href="#97062">ðŸ”—</a>lobawad &#x3C;lobawad@...&#x3E;</h3><span>3/14/2011 12:29:20 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;cityoftheasleep&quot; &lt;igliashon@...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Well, you got the 24 and the 26.

Long after the Middle East has established peace, people will be bickering about this. :-)</p><p>Anyway the whole deal with regular temperaments and maqam musics is oriented (ouch) toward polyphony.

On guitar, size isn&apos;t everything, and 36&apos;s relationship with 12 could make it easier than, say, 31.  Especially if every 3rd fret was painted or marked in some way.  Or every even fret to mark out 18-EDO, which is another fave.  For me, it&apos;s more a question of what I&apos;d want to use it for that I couldn&apos;t get in a smaller EDO.  I&apos;m sure when I start looking at temperaments in 36 I&apos;ll find some cool things to use it for.</p><p>-Igs</p></div>
