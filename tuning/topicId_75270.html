Does  anyone know of any earlier example of the usage<br/>&gt; of No. 3, or even  No. 1 as others had it, before Barbour?</p><p>Well, certainly both Sorge and Marpurg attributed that same one of<br/>C-G-D-A and B-F# (1/4 PC each) back to Werckmeister.</p><p>And according to Barbour&apos;s 1947 article &quot;Bach and the Art of<br/>Temperament&quot; (Musical Quarterly 33:1, 1947), there was a 1925 article<br/>&quot;Akustik&quot; by a K. E. Schumann also doing so.  This 1947 article by<br/>Barbour gives an appendix that includes &quot;Werckmeister&apos;s &apos;correct&apos;<br/>temperaments&quot; that he himself (Barbour) numbers from 1 to 3, and it&apos;s<br/>#1 here.</p><p>In Barbour&apos;s 1948 article &quot;Irregular systems of temperament&quot; (JAMS<br/>1:3), Barbour again called it &quot;Werckmeister&apos;s First &apos;Correct&apos;<br/>Temperament&quot;.  (On the same page, incidentally, Barbour offered an<br/>absurd criticism of Marpurg&apos;s Temperament G: &quot;In G the comma is<br/>supposed to be divided into five equal parts, but 5 x 5 is 25!  To<br/>have come out even, Marpurg should have made the altered fifths 4.8<br/>cents flat, instead of 5 cents.&quot;  What, Marpurg used cents, years<br/>ahead of his time?!)</p><p>Turning to Barbour&apos;s 1965-6 article &quot;Temperatur und Stimmung&quot; in MGG,<br/>the article has more technical proofreados than his book did; really a<br/>mess for an article that is barely over seven pages, crammed in.<br/>Tables 11, 12, 13, 20, and 21 (at least) have printing errors, and I<br/>haven&apos;t spent so much time checking the earlier pages where there<br/>might be more.  The Werckmeister temp given here is table 20, but the<br/>B has a +1/4 superscript instead of a 0.  And the text about this has<br/>yet another howler: &quot;In seiner bekanntesten werden die vier Quinten<br/>C-G, G-D, D-A und H-Fis durch 1/3 Komma temperiert, die acht uebrigen<br/>Quinten sind rein.  Die beiden besten grossen Terzen erscheinen um 1/4<br/>Komma zu hoch (390 C), und die drei schlechtesten sind pythagoraeisch<br/>(408 C; s. Tab. 20).&quot;  Whoever typeset his article didn&apos;t exhibit much<br/>care with numerals, giving 1/4 as 1/3.  But anyway, that temperament<br/>is not given any name here other than &quot;bekanntesten&quot; (most familiar).</p><p>Brad Lehman</p></div><h3>Afmmjr@aol.com</h3><span>2/29/2008 6:25:10 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Thanks, for getting back, Brad.</p><p>But it is not certain at all for Sorge.

WIII is a  natural<br/>consequence of<br/>&gt; meantone with the precise purpose of escaping wolves, a  modified<br/>meantone</p><p>I disagree. In order to merely &quot;escape wolves&quot;, Werckmeister need only<br/>do what he did in his continuo temperament. Actually, he could have<br/>saved a lot more time and money had he simply tweaked the pipes for F,<br/>G, D, A, E, B, F# by the max allowed for by cone tuning, reducing the<br/>tempering of the fifths they produce as much as possible, leaving the<br/>others to be either cut or lengthened to follow a typical scheme of<br/>pure or slightly larger than pure fifths to smooth out the wolves.</p><p>Obviously, he was more concerned with rationally eliminating the<br/>Pythagorean comma, which is generally considered to be the essence of<br/>what differentiates circulating or &quot;Well&quot; temperaments from meantones.</p><p>Actually, between his continuo temperament and Copperplate III (to use<br/>the modern invention), there is no difference in &quot;escaping wolves&quot;, at<br/>least not as long as you are using the modern invention of calling the<br/>fifths the wolves and not the thirds.</p><p>;-)</p><p>Seriously, though, I consider these two points to be the essence of<br/>ANY meantone, modified or not:</p><p>(1) A basis of an unbroken chain of consistently tempered fifths,<br/>located in the natural keys, whose degree of tempering is specified<br/>(either numerically or qualitatively) by the quality of the major<br/>third that four of them produce. It is precisely this unbroken chain<br/>from whence comes the name, for only when there are four fifths of the<br/>same size in a row is the natural and unavoidable result a whole<br/>&quot;tone&quot; which is the geometric &quot;mean&quot; of the major third.</p><p>(2) The adherence to a long uninterrupted cycle of such fifths causes<br/>a cumulative over-compensation relative the Pythagorean comma (what<br/>Jorgenson rather amusingly calls &quot;harmonic waste&quot;). In regular<br/>meantones, it is concentrated in 1 wold fifths, 4 wolf major thirds<br/>and 3 wolf minor thirds. In modified meantones, the chain is shorter<br/>and the wolves are diced up more or less so that they seem merely<br/>misbehaved puppies who piss on the carpet and chew the drapes rather<br/>than gnawing off your leg as real wolves do.</p><p>Note that none of the copperplate temperaments exhibit either of<br/>these. IV and V do have over-compensation, but it is not produced by<br/>contiguous fifths. Most notably, the tone C-D in Copperplate III is<br/>NOT the geo mean of C-E, and therefore in my book cannot be called any<br/>sort of meantone. Of the three, one could argue that IV is a meantone<br/>derivative, because all he&apos;s really done is taken a garden variety 1/6<br/>comma modified meantone and concentrated the total tempering of two<br/>adjacent fifths into every other fifth. Therefore, the tone generally<br/>IS the mean, either through the pattern of t-p-t-p or p-t-p-t.</p><p>&gt;<br/>&gt; Surely, after you have your coffee perhaps, no one on this  List<br/>should feel<br/>&gt; censured in questioning the meaning of terms,</p><p>Well, it&apos;s always healthy to question terminology, coffee or no. And<br/>in the absence of some international oversight committee, there may be<br/>some disagreement of terms. Generally, though, there is an agreed-upon<br/>meaning which a large body of those who use the term would recognize<br/>instantly, as in the case with &quot;pure&quot;, Brad&apos;s aberration not<br/>withstanding.

Whenever somebody says &quot;the Pythagorean scale&quot; I always say,<br/>&quot;Which one?&quot;</p><p>&gt;<br/>&gt; Your definition for modified meantone was very much  appreciated,<br/>but seemed<br/>&gt; a bit overwrought...a bit of a wrestle.

I  just don&apos;t feel it.</p><p>For me, the essence is expressed in Rameau&apos;s tuning directions, where<br/>he tells yo to start &quot;the division&quot;, which is tuning a row of four<br/>narrow fifths such that yo arrive at a pure third, and you carry on<br/>until &quot;a certain point&quot; where you abandon &quot;the division&quot;.<br/>Werckmeister&apos;s instruction is essentially a German translation of the<br/>same thing. The point being that instruction to set meantone would<br/>have been exactly the same, except carrying on with &quot;the division&quot;.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Paul:  I disagree.

It actually<br/>has less Pythaogrean thirds, of corse at the slight cost to the purity<br/>of the &quot;good&quot;thirds. But everything is plenty usuable, and there is<br/>more variation because you don&apos;t have that long chain of pure fifths,<br/>which has always been my complaint about CPIII.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Paul: Obviously, he was more concerned with rationally  eliminating the<br/>&gt; Pythagorean comma, which is generally considered to be the  essence of<br/>&gt; what differentiates circulating or &quot;Well&quot; temperaments from  meantones.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Johnny: With all due respect, he couldn&apos;t care less about the  comma.</p><p>Funny, then, that he went to all that trouble of working out the<br/>string lengths dividing the P comma. Oh well, one of those quirky<br/>things about history, I guess.</p><p>Funny also how in his continuo temperament, he specifically says in<br/>this particular instance he doesn&apos;t want to talk about this or that<br/>comma, because he wants to keep it simple for the beginning player.<br/>Implying, of course, that in other instances, directed toward a more<br/>sophisticated audience, he DOES deal with this or that particular comma.</p><p>&gt; Werckmeister III is all about escaping wolves.  Another small<br/>point, what is<br/>&gt; &quot;generally considered&quot; has not been very reliable  sometimes.</p><p>Well, mixing what is reliable and what is generally undrstood is<br/>mixing apples and oranges. I know that it is totaly unreliable that<br/>Bach wrote the WTC for equal temperament, yet there is STILL a large<br/>number of people who tink it is so, so when speaking to the Great<br/>Unwashed, I know I have to be careful about what is generally understood.</p><p>  As you know, I am<br/>&gt; working with some new categories.  For  example, I want to always<br/>distinguish<br/>&gt; between irregular tuning that is not a  full circle, and irregular<br/>tuning that is<br/>&gt; in a full circle.  To that  effect, irregular tuning that is a full<br/>circle is<br/>&gt; the definition of well  temperament.  Logically, there is now a<br/>complete<br/>&gt; difference between  irregular tuning and well temperament.</p><p>Well temperament. Another term that drives me around the bend,<br/>especially since I speak German. What a bogus term, invented by a<br/>bunch of dummies who don&apos;t know the difference between an adjective<br/>and an adverb.</p><p>That much aside, I frankly don&apos;t know what the general perception is<br/>about the meaning of well temperament. I always tell my students not<br/>to use it, and everybody else seems foggy on the notion. &quot;You know,<br/>like Werckmeister, or Vallotti/Young, or Kirnberger&quot; is generally the<br/>level of sophistication I encounter.</p><p>&gt;<br/>&gt; By your definition, I can see why you protest against  WIII being<br/>considered<br/>&gt; a modified meantone.  And I thank you for your  evaluations.  It<br/>helps to get<br/>&gt; feedback.  But the words &quot;modified  meantone&quot; as with other List<br/>discussions<br/>&gt; that argue terms still mean little but  a pedigree, often<br/>controversial, and<br/>&gt; relatively meaningless to the music  listener.</p><p>I disagree, since many modified meantones SOUND completely meantoney<br/>in the home keys. You only notice it&apos;s NOT meantone when the music<br/>wanders into zones normally populated by wolves, or when harmonies<br/>that ought to have pure thirds end up have somewhat wide thirds.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I suspect Werckmeister would have been surprised that  his natural<br/>&gt; consequence of meantone would not be considered a  modification.</p><p>Who knows?

I assume you mean WIII and not IV or V, but in<br/>regards to them all you could say the point is to make all keys usable<br/>will keeping the natural keys purer than the accidental keys, and the<br/>logic is dividing the Pythagorean comma in a small number of parts<br/>which distributed according to a very irregular scheme, including the<br/>over-distribution which requires the introductin of larger than pure<br/>fifths for correction. ET, on the other hand, intends to make ALL keys<br/>exactly the same, and it does so by distributing the Pythagorean comma<br/>in the most regular method imaginable, and not allowing any<br/>overcompensation t all. Other than the fact that they are both Pyth<br/>comma systems, I don&apos;t see any grounds for arguing that the one is a<br/>modified form of the other; for me they are cabbage and strawberries.<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; Is not meantone &quot;modified just intonation&quot;?</p><p>No. The essence of any form of JI is pure intervals. No prisoners<br/>taken. Those impure intervals which inevitably result are like<br/>collateral casualties, the unfortunate victims of the necessity of<br/>achieving a Higher Case, rigidly following an extremist ideology. It<br/>is a Tuning. Meantone, on the other hand, in any of its various forms,<br/>is a Temperament, and its very essence lies in the idea of compromise.<br/>It&apos;s basic approach is the purposeful DEtuning of certain important<br/>consonances in order to arrive at a pure version or near pure (another<br/>compromise) version of other important consonances. JI does not<br/>include an purposeful detuning of anything; some intervals<br/>accidentally end up detuned, but their detuning is an inherent part of<br/>neither the logic nor the methodology.</p><p>Actually, I would say that all Tunings are diametrically opposed to<br/>all Temperaments in every possible way.<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; Is not Pythagorean &quot;modified just intonation&quot;?<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>No. Pythagorean is a subclass of JI. It is 3-limit JI, or to be true<br/>to the original Pythagoreans, it is 4-limit JI in keeping with the<br/>precepts of the Tetrakyts. 5-limit and 7-limit are also a subclasses<br/>of JI. Saying that Pythagorean is modified JI is like saying a cat is<br/>a modified mammal. You&apos;re confusing levels in the hierarchical<br/>classification system.</p><p>Now, about modified meantones. All meantones use an unbroken chain of<br/>purposely detuned fifths, the size of which is determined by the<br/>desire to arrive at a consistently pure or close to pure major third.<br/>The resulting gap is irrelevant because the resulting bad thirds (the<br/>original wolves) are not intended to be used, except perhaps for<br/>dramatic effect. The temperaments I call modified meantones generally<br/>exhibit a structure which is mostly meantone with a slight variation<br/>in that there is exactly the same long chain intentionally tempered<br/>fifths, the size of which is determined by the desire to arrive at a<br/>consistently pure or close to pure major third, but with the inclusion<br/>of several fifths which do not adhere to this principle, applied to<br/>reduce the harshness of the wolf thirds, making them usable without<br/>the listener cringing, wherein lies the modification both in logic and<br/>intent.</p><p>I could also say that in the case of Preatorius, the  logic AND intent<br/>are both literally explained as modifications of regular meantone. One<br/>could argue the same for Schlick. Rameau also describes how at a<br/>certain point, one deviates from &quot;the division&quot;, i.e. the normal<br/>meantone scheme of dividing the S comma among four consecutive fifths.<br/>So there we&apos;ve got two and maybe three original sources which say<br/>start with meantone (admittedly without using that modern word) but<br/>modify it at a certain point. Werkmeister says nothing of the sort in<br/>regards to any of the 3 copperplate &quot;richtige temperaturen&quot;; they are<br/>created anew.</p><p>On the other hand, his instructions for the continuo temperament can<br/>quite easily be construed to be a deviation from a meantone scheme, in<br/>that the tuner is told to temper ALL of the primary fifths by the same<br/>amount so as to arrive at a certain consistent quality of &quot;good&quot; major<br/>third. This logic is consistently adhered to until the point at which<br/>one modifies it to avoid the appearance of wolves, which is another<br/>thing he literally says in the form of wanting to arrive at<br/>multifunctional thirds produced by the accidentals, which is THE<br/>historical meaning of &quot;avoiding wolves&quot;.</p><p>That&apos;s my take on it.

In<br/>other words, suppose someone had already set a beautiful, flawless 1/4<br/>regular meantone on a instrument. Could I go and very quickly, with a<br/>minimum of retuning, say only retouching a few notes, &quot;modify&quot; the<br/>existing temperament so as to arrive at one or another of the<br/>temperaments which I call &quot;modified meantones&quot;? The answer is clearly<br/>yes, as long as it is one of those based on 1/4 comma mean (like<br/>Rameau). The same holds try for Werckmeister&apos;s modified meantone (the<br/>1698 continuo temperament) if the instrument has been tuned in any<br/>regular meantone milder than 1/5 comma. In all cases, one only need<br/>tweak a small handful of fifths.</p><p>&gt; Is not equal temperament &quot;modified Werckmeister&quot;?</p><p>The same cannot be said for &quot;modifying&quot; Werckmeister III, IV, or V so<br/>as to produce Equal, at least not if you are adhering to the<br/>historical practice of keeping C as the unmoving reference (and I have<br/>to say I don&apos;t think any other approach has any relevance to the<br/>discussion, as there is no doubt that C was THE starting point for<br/>Werckmeister, as well as many others, including Neidhardt and Sorge,<br/>just to name a few). The fact the tempering is always heavily<br/>concentrated in a small number of fifths on the right half of the<br/>circle mean you are going to have to do a lot of pushing things around<br/>before you can even beginning to reset anything. In fact, not one<br/>single note other than C can be left in its original position. You may<br/>as well chuck the whole thing out and start over again from C. I fail<br/>to see how such a drastic alteration can be viewed as a &quot;modification&quot;.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Is not meantone &quot;modified just intonation&quot;?</p><p>Exactly the same argument holds here. The only notes which need no<br/>modifying are C and E. ALL of the rest require alterations, and their<br/>JI positions are of no assistance to arriving at their new positions.<br/>In fact, the usual &quot;Just Intonation&quot; of the diatonic scale doesn&apos;t<br/>even begin to address the location of the sharps. Once again, except<br/>for the pure third on C-E, you&apos;re no worse off if the instrument is<br/>completely out-of-tune when you begin.</p><p>Anyway, curious about your logic.</p><p>Ciao,</p><p>P</p></div><h3>Caleb Morgan &#x3C;calebmrgn@yahoo.com&#x3E;</h3><span>3/3/2008 5:40:36 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>newbie question:  Are some people here are using the<br/>terms temperament and tuning in a more precise way<br/>than usual?

Not all the intervals which result will be pure or &quot;in<br/>tune&quot;, mind, it&apos;s just that ALL the specific intervals you use to<br/>define ALL of the notes are all pure. The opposite is a temperament,<br/>which is produced by purposely detuning certain intervals, i.e.<br/>&quot;tempering&quot; them. So you can &quot;tune&quot; a harpsichord in any temperament,<br/>or yo can tune it i a tuning.

Will it never end?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; It wasn&apos;t intended to be sarcastic, Oz, I really wanted Johhny to<br/>&gt; explain his thoughts. I mean, I could say something like &quot;Is not<br/>&gt; Goerge Bush a modern Mussollini?&quot;, and I&apos;m sure lots of people these<br/>&gt; days would agree with me instantly. But I haven&apos;t really said anything<br/>&gt; at all, have I? So what would they be agreeing to?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; To argue against Johnny&apos;s hypothetical equations, I would say that the<br/>&gt; word &quot;modified&quot; in any application has to indicate a basic<br/>&gt; characteristic which remains unchanged in some manner AND a variation<br/>&gt; in form which does not go so far as to create something completely<br/>&gt; different. Thus genetically modified corn can only be called such as<br/>&gt; long as it doesn&apos;t begin to look like cabbage or taste like strawberries.<br/>&gt;</p><p>Got yer drift. Your analogies are bizzarre and funny though.</p><p>&gt; A temperament or tuning can be classified in several ways:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; (1) the basic acoustical intent, i.e. producing pure thirds, closing<br/>&gt; the circle, or as Johnny likes to say, avoiding wolves - or a<br/>&gt; combination of more than one intent<br/>&gt;</p><p>OK.</p><p>&gt; (2) a basic structural logic, i.e. distributing the Pythagorean comma,<br/>&gt; distributing the Syntonic comma, not dealing with any comma, regular<br/>&gt; distribution, irregular distribtuion, etc.<br/>&gt;</p><p>Distribtuion, not!</p><p>&gt; (3) a historical development<br/>&gt;</p><p>How can a tuning or temperament develop (as implying continuity of action)?<br/>Let alone historically? After the theorist designs it, it stays as it is.<br/>The slightest modification thereto automatically qualifies it as another<br/>tuning. Maybe you mean &quot;extension to the tuning&quot; as in going forward by the<br/>generator interval such as is the case with negative meantone temperaments<br/>surpassing 12 regular tones?</p><p>&gt; (4) whether it is a tuning or a temperament<br/>&gt;</p><p>Good point.</p><p>&gt; That&apos;s all I can think of at the moment, maybe there are more.<br/>&gt;</p><p>Suppose there is, such as the inharmonicity factor, or presence of<br/>relatively strong overtones to achieve beating or the lack thereof.</p><p>&gt; I suppose one could argue the original/modified dichotomy in regards<br/>&gt; to any one aspect, but I would posit that the term becomes the more<br/>&gt; convincing the more different aspects you can point to.<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Is not equal temperament &quot;modified Werckmeister&quot;?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I don&apos;t see how. I assume you mean WIII and not IV or V, but in<br/>&gt; regards to them all you could say the point is to make all keys usable<br/>&gt; will keeping the natural keys purer than the accidental keys, and the<br/>&gt; logic is dividing the Pythagorean comma in a small number of parts<br/>&gt; which distributed according to a very irregular scheme, including the<br/>&gt; over-distribution which requires the introductin of larger than pure<br/>&gt; fifths for correction. ET, on the other hand, intends to make ALL keys<br/>&gt; exactly the same, and it does so by distributing the Pythagorean comma<br/>&gt; in the most regular method imaginable, and not allowing any<br/>&gt; overcompensation t all. Other than the fact that they are both Pyth<br/>&gt; comma systems, I don&apos;t see any grounds for arguing that the one is a<br/>&gt; modified form of the other; for me they are cabbage and strawberries.</p><p>Surely, a twelve-tone layout can be modified in certain ways to result in<br/>another twelve-tone layout. The process of modification can involve many<br/>steps and pitch manipulations without endangering the concept of<br/>modification.</p><p>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Is not meantone &quot;modified just intonation&quot;?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; No. The essence of any form of JI is pure intervals. No prisoners<br/>&gt; taken. Those impure intervals which inevitably result are like<br/>&gt; collateral casualties, the unfortunate victims of the necessity of<br/>&gt; achieving a Higher Case, rigidly following an extremist ideology. It<br/>&gt; is a Tuning. Meantone, on the other hand, in any of its various forms,<br/>&gt; is a Temperament, and its very essence lies in the idea of compromise.<br/>&gt; It&apos;s basic approach is the purposeful DEtuning of certain important<br/>&gt; consonances in order to arrive at a pure version or near pure (another<br/>&gt; compromise) version of other important consonances. JI does not<br/>&gt; include an purposeful detuning of anything; some intervals<br/>&gt; accidentally end up detuned, but their detuning is an inherent part of<br/>&gt; neither the logic nor the methodology.<br/>&gt;</p><p>One can surely modify a tuning so that it becomes a temperament. A 12-tone<br/>Pythagorean tuning can be altered in just 2 notes (Eb, Bb) by 2/3 and 1/3<br/>PCs respectively to make it a cyclic temperament. Further modification will<br/>yield other tunings. Thereby, meantone is just as much a modified JI as it<br/>is a modified Pythagorean tuning.</p><p>&gt; Actually, I would say that all Tunings are diametrically opposed to<br/>&gt; all Temperaments in every possible way.<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Is not Pythagorean &quot;modified just intonation&quot;?<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; No. Pythagorean is a subclass of JI. It is 3-limit JI, or to be true<br/>&gt; to the original Pythagoreans, it is 4-limit JI in keeping with the<br/>&gt; precepts of the Tetrakyts. 5-limit and 7-limit are also a subclasses<br/>&gt; of JI. Saying that Pythagorean is modified JI is like saying a cat is<br/>&gt; a modified mammal. You&apos;re confusing levels in the hierarchical<br/>&gt; classification system.<br/>&gt;</p><p>I agree with you here.</p><p>&gt; Now, about modified meantones. All meantones use an unbroken chain of<br/>&gt; purposely detuned fifths, the size of which is determined by the<br/>&gt; desire to arrive at a consistently pure or close to pure major third.<br/>&gt; The resulting gap is irrelevant because the resulting bad thirds (the<br/>&gt; original wolves) are not intended to be used, except perhaps for<br/>&gt; dramatic effect. The temperaments I call modified meantones generally<br/>&gt; exhibit a structure which is mostly meantone with a slight variation<br/>&gt; in that there is exactly the same long chain intentionally tempered<br/>&gt; fifths, the size of which is determined by the desire to arrive at a<br/>&gt; consistently pure or close to pure major third, but with the inclusion<br/>&gt; of several fifths which do not adhere to this principle, applied to<br/>&gt; reduce the harshness of the wolf thirds, making them usable without<br/>&gt; the listener cringing, wherein lies the modification both in logic and<br/>&gt; intent.<br/>&gt;</p><p>This definition is perfectly suitable for the category of meantone<br/>temperaments that we dub &quot;modified&quot; according to the primary and historical<br/>intent. It does not mean we cannot utilize the concept of modification in<br/>other ways.</p><p>&gt; I could also say that in the case of Preatorius, the  logic AND intent<br/>&gt; are both literally explained as modifications of regular meantone. One<br/>&gt; could argue the same for Schlick. Rameau also describes how at a<br/>&gt; certain point, one deviates from &quot;the division&quot;, i.e. the normal<br/>&gt; meantone scheme of dividing the S comma among four consecutive fifths.<br/>&gt; So there we&apos;ve got two and maybe three original sources which say<br/>&gt; start with meantone (admittedly without using that modern word) but<br/>&gt; modify it at a certain point. Werkmeister says nothing of the sort in<br/>&gt; regards to any of the 3 copperplate &quot;richtige temperaturen&quot;; they are<br/>&gt; created anew.<br/>&gt;</p><p>So, he does not modify a meantone temperament in his original approach to<br/>acquire WIII. That does not mean one cannot arrive at WIII through<br/>modification (no matter how complicated or tedious the procedure may be) of<br/>a meantone temperament.</p><p>&gt; On the other hand, his instructions for the continuo temperament can<br/>&gt; quite easily be construed to be a deviation from a meantone scheme, in<br/>&gt; that the tuner is told to temper ALL of the primary fifths by the same<br/>&gt; amount so as to arrive at a certain consistent quality of &quot;good&quot; major<br/>&gt; third. This logic is consistently adhered to until the point at which<br/>&gt; one modifies it to avoid the appearance of wolves, which is another<br/>&gt; thing he literally says in the form of wanting to arrive at<br/>&gt; multifunctional thirds produced by the accidentals, which is THE<br/>&gt; historical meaning of &quot;avoiding wolves&quot;.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; That&apos;s my take on it. Now I&apos;d be interested in Johhny&apos;s.<br/>&gt;</p><p>See: This definition is perfectly suitable for the category of meantone<br/>temperaments that we dub &quot;modified&quot; according to the primary and historical<br/>intent.

Here&apos;s the Wikipedia definition:</p><p>&quot;In color reproduction, including computer graphics and photography,<br/>the gamut, or color gamut, is a certain complete subset of colors. The<br/>most common usage refers to the subset of colors which can be<br/>accurately represented in a given circumstance, such as within a given<br/>color space or by a certain output device.&quot;</p><p>In organology, gamut is commonly used to describe the range of pitches<br/>an instrument is capable of producing, say FF-f4 for example (using<br/>the most common organological pitch notation) for a typical Viennese<br/>piano of 1815.</p><p>In the field of tuning/temperament, pitch gamut is restricted to an<br/>octave (unless its a system which doesn&apos;t repeat at the octave) can be<br/>either virtual or actual. Most western instruments which have fixed or<br/>semi-fixed pitches have a practical gamut which reproduces the<br/>theoretical gamut, but you might just as well have an extended<br/>theoretical system which goes way beyond the standard 12 note gamut,<br/>but the instrument may be capable of producing only a small select<br/>subset of those notes. Your standard kanun is a good example of an<br/>instrument which has a practical gamut which is only a selected subset<br/>from the virtual gamut, a subset which must be chosen before you begin<br/>playing (which of course can be somewhat modified during performance<br/>by the mandals). Another example is an archicembalo, which may<br/>reproduce a limited extension of a much larger theoretical gamut of<br/>extended meantone.</p><p>&gt;<br/>&gt; As a _tuning_ it&apos;s a tuning of some unnamed<br/>&gt; well temperament (class).</p><p>What is a &quot;well&quot; temperament?

Generally, I hear it used by people who have so little real<br/>knowledge of historical temperaments (present company excluded), that<br/>the only thing I can say is that for them it means not meantone, not<br/>Pythagorean, and not Equal. It&apos;s just a big bargain basement grab bag<br/>into which they toss anything else, which usually only means WIII,<br/>Kinrberger III, and the ubiquitous two-headed hydra &quot;Vallotti/Young&quot;.<br/>If pressed, they will say something like, &quot;It means you can use all<br/>the keys.&quot; Some will ad that no fifth can be larger than pure<br/>(harmonically-efficient according to Jorgenson?).

That isn&apos;t what I&apos;d expect from someone who<br/>&gt; wrote a paper declaring a new paradigm in music theory.  Any<br/>&gt; new paradigm has the right and probably the obligation to<br/>&gt; practice a precise terminology, using terms either invented<br/>&gt; or suitably adapted, and then to extract and publish<br/>&gt; definitions from that practice.  Gene did the extracting and<br/>&gt; monz did the publishing, and there followed 7 years of further<br/>&gt; use that seems to be consistent.  As Paul points out, in<br/>&gt; early some circles a temperament means a 12-tone well temperament.<br/>&gt; We can certainly let them.</p><p>I wrote a web page explaining the paradigm using terminology that you say is inconsistent with the paradigm.  Surely I can speak up about that!</p><p>There are cases where terms need to be adapted when they&apos;re applied to new things.  We do plenty of that (tunings with an infinite number of notes, temperaments with rational intervals, temperaments of inharmonic timbres) but there&apos;s no need to make gratuitous changes.</p><p>What practice did Gene &quot;extract&quot; definitions from?  It looked like he was making up his own definitions.</p><p>What did Monz publish?  His encyclopedia lists Gene&apos;s definition along with three (one of them mine) that say a temperament is a tuning.</p><p>What further use?  Gene didn&apos;t get much beyond the definitions.  A Middle Path talks about tunings, but also says they&apos;re not essential, suggesting the terminology wasn&apos;t fixed then.  I&apos;ve written a web page and a PDF that use &quot;temperament class&quot; and another PDF nearly finished. George Secor talks about the meantone temperament (properly, with the article) as a single tuning.  There are also references in the archives that you seem blind to.

So you weren&apos;t specifying a tuning.</p><p>No, not just an ordering.  I was pointedly not requiring a tuning, which ties in with usages like &quot;the diatonic scale&quot; or &quot;the blackjack scale&quot; but it&apos;d hardly be surprising if other usages conflict with that.  I don&apos;t know how other people understand it.</p><p>&gt;&gt; Is there any controversy about &quot;tuning&quot;?<br/>&gt; &gt; Lots of people call things like Valotti and 12-ET &quot;tunings&quot;.<br/>&gt; Probably the most common term among piano tuners.  So you<br/>&gt; see, in the world at large terminology is not consistent.<br/>&gt; But in each school, it is more consistent.  And within a<br/>&gt; music theory school heavily dependent on 1. math and 2. e-mail<br/>&gt; for communication, ours should be the most consistent.</p><p>And they are tunings, aren&apos;t they?</p><p>&gt;&gt; What have &quot;temperament classes&quot; got to do with anything?<br/>&gt; &gt; They&apos;re this term you invented and keep using even though<br/>&gt; nobody else is.</p><p>It looks like other people are using it, but if it&apos;s under some kind of duress, what of it?</p><p>&gt;&gt; In &gt;&gt; fact I was using them before, and you found a reference.  So &gt;&gt; presumably you had a tasty bug ready.<br/>&gt; &gt; It wasn&apos;t clear from the context of that message.  But if you&apos;ll<br/>&gt; confirm it, I will eat a bug.  However I could probably find on<br/>&gt; your website plenty of examples of the Gene&apos;s terminology.  Oh,<br/>&gt; bother...<br/>&gt; The only place I find &quot;temperament class&quot; is on your regular<br/>&gt; mapping paradigm page.  I see plenty of examples of &quot;meantone<br/>&gt; temperament&quot; to mean the class, though to be fair you just<br/>&gt; about as often use the phrase &quot;meantone temperaments&quot; as well.</p><p>I don&apos;t remember using the term that early, but the archive clearly shows that I did.  The reference I gave above is unambiguous.  As is this one from 2001:</p><p><a href="http://www.robertinventor.com/tuning-math/s___2/msg_1275-1299.html">http://www.robertinventor.com/tuning-math/s___2/msg_1275-1299.html</a></p><p>But then in 2001 I was also using &quot;temperament&quot; to mean the same thing and &quot;temperament family&quot; for something similar. It&apos;s only in 2002 that I can find a reference for &quot;linear temperament family&quot; which is the term I thought I used until it got redefined by the collective.  And I was clearly using &quot;temperament class&quot; as well.</p><p>I try to be more conservative about the terminology I use on web pages because they&apos;re more permanent.  Hence the only reference to &quot;temperament class&quot; on an HTML page is on the one I wrote after consciously changing the terminology.  But it&apos;s also used in <a href="http://regular.zip">regular.zip</a>, primerr.pdf, and complete.pdf so that&apos;s hardly the only place on my website.  Before the great shift I would have tried to fit what I wanted to say around the word &quot;temperament&quot; with the occasional &quot;family&quot;.</p><p>&gt; Here&apos;s a &quot;Catalog of Linear Temperaments&quot;<br/>&gt; <a href="http://x31eq.com/catalog.htm">http://x31eq.com/catalog.htm</a><br/>&gt; not a &quot;catalog of linear temperament classes&quot;.</p><p>Right, that&apos;s a page from 2001, before I had anything else to call them.  And it&apos;s what I was discussing with Dave when we talked about temperaments being defined by mappings.  At that stage the terminology was unclear (consistent with the crisis preceding a paradigm shift).</p><p>Also, they should be &quot;rank 2 temperament classes&quot; with the current, strict definition of &quot;linear temperament&quot;.</p><p>&gt; You *do* seem to be using your tuning-invariant definition<br/>&gt; of &quot;scale&quot;, FWIW.</p><p>But I may not specify the ordering.</p><p>What I think we need is a disambiguation of &quot;pitch&quot;.  In psychoacoustic terms, it&apos;s a subjective quantity associated with a frequency.  But isn&apos;t it also used in music for things like &quot;C#&quot; or &quot;Gb&quot; where a tuning isn&apos;t specified?  So the definition of &quot;scale&quot; isn&apos;t a problem because a scale&apos;s always a list of pitches.  The problem is that &quot;pitch&quot; can mean different things.</p><p>Unfortunately &quot;pitch class&quot; won&apos;t do although I&apos;m sure I heard a definition that was pretty close.  I&apos;ve been using &quot;note&quot; but that&apos;s probably not at all accepted.  Perhaps it&apos;s what you meant by &quot;letter names&quot;.</p><p>&gt;&gt; Perhaps 2006 was when &gt;&gt; I was told to stop using &quot;temperament family&quot;.  I don&apos;t &gt;&gt; remember.<br/>&gt; &gt; Yes, because Gene had already published a web page and a<br/>&gt; dozen messages to tuning-math using the term for something<br/>&gt; else.</p><p>There are still some references to &quot;family&quot; on my website, but I don&apos;t think they conflict.  It looks like Gene and I were using the term with different meanings in 2004 so the switch to &quot;temperament class&quot; must have been around then. But I had to use a borrowed internet connection late 2004 and early 2005, and then I was in hospital for a month, and had various other disruptions, so it&apos;s quite possible I didn&apos;t start talking about temperament classes until 2006.</p><p>                 Graham</p></div><h3>Carl Lumma &#x3C;carl@lumma.org&#x3E;</h3><span>3/6/2008 11:57:40 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>&gt; &gt; What term are you referring to?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &quot;Meantone temperament is a temperament&quot; with respect to &quot;The<br/>&gt; Article&quot;.</p><p>If I said that it was strictly a mistake (probably the<br/>result of someone talking to me while I was writing it).</p><p>&gt; That looks like a special-case definition for a<br/>&gt; mathematically based theory we haven&apos;t seen yet.

It talks &gt;&gt; about real numbers, which suggests a relationship to &gt;&gt; frequencies, but doesn&apos;t define it.<br/>&gt; &gt; Some of his proofs may require (or later assume) you&apos;ve<br/>&gt; got reals.  Certainly you limit the kinds of caculations<br/>&gt; you can do when calculating scales.<br/>&gt; &gt; He says they&apos;re log-pitch.  He also goes on in that<br/>&gt; message to define things like &quot;periodic scale&quot;, &quot;periodic<br/>&gt; reduced scale&quot;, and &quot;epimorphic scale&quot;.</p><p>Okay.  It&apos;s over-precise then.</p><p>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; What are Scala files supposed to embody?<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt; They meet Gene&apos;s definition, and they&apos;re called &quot;scale<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt; files&quot;.<br/>&gt;&gt; They meet pretty much any definition.<br/>&gt; &gt; Not at all.  You can&apos;t put &quot;meantone&quot; in a scale file.</p><p>There&apos;s a difference between scale files containing scales and all scales being compatible with a scale file.</p><p>&gt;&gt; What else was Manuel &gt;&gt; supposed to call them back when he started writing Scala?<br/>&gt; &gt; How would the era in which he did it matter?  He obviously<br/>&gt; felt the abstraction was worth defining a file format around,<br/>&gt; and he used the closest existing term for a name, which<br/>&gt; turned out to be close enough not to confuse anybody.  All<br/>&gt; of which mirrors what Gene did.</p><p>We were talking about usage in the context of the regular mapping paradigm.  It makes a great deal of difference whether the regular mapping paradigm was in existence. Scala files are an excellent way of recording microtonal scales.</p><p>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; They&apos;re certainly ordered, which was the issue before.<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt; Yes but you seemed to be talking about just an ordering,<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt; i.e. letter names.  So you weren&apos;t specifying a tuning.<br/>&gt;&gt; No, not just an ordering.  I was pointedly not requiring a &gt;&gt; tuning, which ties in with usages like &quot;the diatonic scale&quot; &gt;&gt; or &quot;the blackjack scale&quot; but it&apos;d hardly be surprising if &gt;&gt; other usages conflict with that.<br/>&gt; &gt; So exactly how *do* you define it?  I know you&apos;ve used<br/>&gt; xL + ys notation, but that doesn&apos;t get you all the way to<br/>&gt; &quot;the blackjack scale&quot; (you need to specify L and s and<br/>&gt; miracle temperament, or L and s and the distribution of<br/>&gt; L &amp; s, or something).</p><p>Why do I need to specify miracle temperament?  Why do I need to define anything?</p><p>&gt; And &quot;the blackjack scale&quot; is something you&apos;re apparently<br/>&gt; making up.  People usually just say &quot;blackjack&quot; (42 vs. 8<br/>&gt; matches in my tuning list archives from &apos;03-05).</p><p><a href="http://tonalsoft.com/enc/b/blackjack.aspx">http://tonalsoft.com/enc/b/blackjack.aspx</a></p><p><a href="http://tonalsoft.com/monzo/blackjack/blackjack.aspx">http://tonalsoft.com/monzo/blackjack/blackjack.aspx</a></p><p>What is it then?</p><p>&gt;&gt; I don&apos;t know how other &gt;&gt; people understand it.<br/>&gt; &gt; As Kraig just explained, Wilson starts with Gene&apos;s def.<br/>&gt; and further requires either MOS or a CS in JI.</p><p>Reference?</p><p>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Is there any controversy about &quot;tuning&quot;?<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt; Lots of people call things like Valotti and 12-ET &quot;tunings&quot;.<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt; Probably the most common term among piano tuners.  So you<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt; see, in the world at large terminology is not consistent.<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt; But in each school, it is more consistent.  And within a<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt; music theory school heavily dependent on 1. math and<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt; 2. e-mail for communication, ours should be the most<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt; consistent.<br/>&gt;&gt; And they are tunings, aren&apos;t they?<br/>&gt; &gt; You could argue that a restriction to the 12-ET patent val<br/>&gt; mapping is taken for granted among piano tuners.  In that<br/>&gt; case it would be valid usage.</p><p>When wouldn&apos;t it be?</p><p>&gt;&gt; Before the &gt;&gt; great shift I would have tried to fit what I wanted to say &gt;&gt; around the word &quot;temperament&quot; with the occasional &quot;family&quot;.<br/>&gt; &gt; So you consciously changed it.  Did you tell anybody about<br/>&gt; your decision at the time?</p><p>I thought I was following the consensus from tuning-math.  I don&apos;t have the reference.  I don&apos;t even remember whose suggestion it was.</p><p>&gt;&gt; What I think we need is a disambiguation of &quot;pitch&quot;.  In &gt;&gt; psychoacoustic terms, it&apos;s a subjective quantity associated &gt;&gt; with a frequency.<br/>&gt; &gt; The term could either mean a sound subjectively characterized<br/>&gt; by a frequency (and perhaps a confidence interval), or the<br/>&gt; class of all sounds someone or some group of people have<br/>&gt; or would characterize by a certain frequency (and confidence<br/>&gt; interval).  The usage isn&apos;t consistent.</p><p>There you go.</p><p>&gt; The terms floating around in this space are &quot;tone&quot;, &quot;note&quot;,<br/>&gt; and &quot;pitch&quot;.  We could try to standardize them so they make<br/>&gt; sense (assign them to 3 concepts that are as different from<br/>&gt; one another as possible without breaking a large majority<br/>&gt; of prior usage of the term).  And then 7 years later somebody<br/>&gt; will come along and say we did it all wrong.</p><p>7 years is pretty good going for tuning terminology.  How long before we get a replacement for &quot;unison vector&quot;?</p><p>&gt;&gt; Unfortunately &quot;pitch class&quot; won&apos;t do although I&apos;m sure I &gt;&gt; heard a definition that was pretty close.<br/>&gt; &gt; &quot;Pitch class&quot; is well defined, on the other hand, by<br/>&gt; Babbit or whoever.  It&apos;s the latter meaning of pitch I gave<br/>&gt; above plus octave equivalence.</p><p>That&apos;s what I thought I read, but other people say the only defining feature is octave equivalence.</p><p>                  Graham</p></div><h3>Klaus Schmirler &#x3C;KSchmir@online.de&#x3E;</h3><span>3/7/2008 6:00:19 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Graham Breed schrieb:<br/>&gt; Klaus Schmirler wrote:<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt; May I kindly ask the parties to consider what &quot;to temper&quot; means and &gt;&gt; what it might be that is tempered?<br/>&gt; &gt; Toast toast toast toast<br/>&gt; Toast toast toast toast<br/>&gt; Toast toast toast toast<br/>&gt; Toast toast toast toast<br/>&gt; Toast toast toast toast<br/>&gt; Toast toast toast toast<br/>&gt; Toast toast toast toast<br/>&gt; Toast toast toast toast<br/>&gt; Toast toast toast toast<br/>&gt; &gt; What do you put in a toaster?</p><p>What do you put in a temperer, if not a tuning?

Did he do tuning on the side?</p><p>&gt; But maybe you&apos;re just not interested in historical temperaments, in<br/>&gt; which case I could understand. Admittedly, the whole lot of them is<br/>&gt; pretty boring and simplistic, compared to more interesting stuff.</p><p>There are plenty of things I take an interest in without being an expert.</p><p>&gt;&gt;&gt; I assume they are still rank 1, but are they regular or irregular? I<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt; would assume the late, but then why don&apos;t you call them &quot;well<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt; temperaments&quot;? Maybe you do.<br/>&gt;&gt; If they&apos;re modified I take it they aren&apos;t regular any more.<br/>&gt; &gt; Now that&apos;s a no brainer!</p><p>Unless, of course, the modification&apos;s that the fifths are all a different size.</p><p>&gt;&gt;   Meantone is rank 2 even if you take a finite subset within &gt;&gt; the octave.  There&apos;s a distinction between perfect fifths &gt;&gt; and wolves, for example.<br/>&gt; &gt; The so-called &quot;wolf&quot; fifth is not a fifth, its either a dimisihed 6th<br/>&gt; or an augmented 3rd. Actually, all correct intervals in meantone<br/>&gt; (those that can be spelled correctly using the nonenhamronic functions<br/>&gt; of the accidentals) are all of the same size, so isn&apos;t that rank 1, or<br/>&gt; do I misunderstand the ranking of ranks?</p><p>No, that&apos;s a sign of rank 2.  Not all intervals of the same number of steps are treated the same.  If the wolf could be taken as a fifth, it&apos;d be rank 1.  And all intervals so described being the same size means it&apos;s a regular temperament.</p><p>&gt; Meantone is open-ended, a system which never closes. It just keeps<br/>&gt; spiraling. It only &quot;closes&quot; with a &quot;wolf fifth&quot; if you impose the idea<br/>&gt; of a 12-tone circular system upon it. The survival of many keyboard<br/>&gt; instruments which were tuned in regular meantone and provided with any<br/>&gt; number of subsemitones shows that old musicians knew that the 12-tone<br/>&gt; version was just a small chunk out of an infinite spiral.</p><p>Right, being &quot;open ended&quot; is another property of the rank being higher than 1.  Rank 2 temperaments are a generalization of meantone.</p><p>&gt;&gt; If you modify them enough for all<br/>&gt;&gt; intervals of a given number of steps to be acceptable, then &gt;&gt; it&apos;d count as rank 1.<br/>&gt; &gt; And how do we define &quot;acceptable&quot;? In other words, playing within the<br/>&gt; variations allowed for by Werckmeister&apos;s instructions, at what point<br/>&gt; do we arrive at a version which makes &quot;all intervals of a given number<br/>&gt; of steps acceptable&quot;? The advantage to calling it a modified meantone<br/>&gt; is because that name tells you something valid about both its<br/>&gt; structure and the practical methodology of actually setting it, yet<br/>&gt; doesn&apos;t get trapped in any such boggy value judgements.</p><p>It&apos;s a subjective judgement, and depends on the person using it.

I know you&apos;ve used<br/>&gt; &gt; xL + ys notation, but that doesn&apos;t get you all the way to<br/>&gt; &gt; &quot;the blackjack scale&quot; (you need to specify L and s and<br/>&gt; &gt; miracle temperament, or L and s and the distribution of<br/>&gt; &gt; L &amp; s, or something).<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Why do I need to specify miracle temperament?  Why do I need<br/>&gt; to define anything?</p><p>&quot;blackjack&quot; means 1. twenty-one 2. adjacent 3. miracle<br/>generators with 4. octave equivalence.  If you want to call<br/>that a &quot;scale&quot; then your definition of &quot;scale&quot; needs to<br/>demand all four of those elements in one way or another.</p><p>If I were using the terms &quot;blackjack&quot; and &quot;scale&quot; together,<br/>I&apos;d say &quot;a blackjack scale&quot; not &quot;the blackjack scale&quot;.</p><p>&gt; &gt; And &quot;the blackjack scale&quot; is something you&apos;re apparently<br/>&gt; &gt; making up.

So you<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; see, in the world at large terminology is not consistent.<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; But in each school, it is more consistent.  And within a<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; music theory school heavily dependent on 1. math and<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; 2. e-mail for communication, ours should be the most<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; consistent.<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt; And they are tunings, aren&apos;t they?<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; You could argue that a restriction to the 12-ET patent val<br/>&gt; &gt; mapping is taken for granted among piano tuners.

The usage isn&apos;t consistent.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; There you go.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; The terms floating around in this space are &quot;tone&quot;, &quot;note&quot;,<br/>&gt; &gt; and &quot;pitch&quot;.

And then 7 years later somebody<br/>&gt; &gt; will come along and say we did it all wrong.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; 7 years is pretty good going for tuning terminology.

How did you tune it?&quot; &quot;I used the quarter<br/>comma meantime temperament.&quot; Now, one could just as easily and as far<br/>as I&apos;m concerned CORRECTLY say, &quot;Oh yeah? What tuning did you use?&quot; &quot;I<br/>used the quarter comma meantime temperament.&quot; In this context, they<br/>both mean exactly the same thing: what kind of plan or scheme or<br/>template or whatever you want to call it you used to decide exactly<br/>where the notes should be in the process of tuning of the harpsichord.</p><p>I personally also maintain that within the specific bounds of talking<br/>about the structural logic of different systems, the word &quot;tuning&quot; can<br/>be used to describe any system by which ALL of the pitches are defined<br/>by intervals which have simple ratios. This of course does not mean<br/>that all of the INTERVALS of the system have simple ratios, nor that<br/>all of these simple generating intervals are taken from the generating<br/>note. Granted, the definition gets fuzzy if we move out into the<br/>further reaches of what many would call extended JI. But almost every<br/>definition or logical system can be pushed to a point where it begins<br/>to break down. So what?</p><p>As to what is a temperament and what is being &quot;tempered&quot;, I&apos;m plenty<br/>happy with the original meaning as implied (if not precisely stated)<br/>by Werckmeister. Go read either the original German:</p><p><a href="http://harpsichords.pbwiki.com/Werckmeister_Anmerckungen_1698">http://harpsichords.pbwiki.com/Werckmeister_Anmerckungen_1698</a></p><p>... or my translation:</p><p><a href="http://polettipiano.com/Pages/werckengpaul.html">http://polettipiano.com/Pages/werckengpaul.html</a></p><p>Remember that this is in the context of traditional western white man<br/>harmony of the 17th century, i.e. what folks here would call 5-limit.<br/>So when he says, &quot;it is not possible to have all the consonances pure<br/>if one moves from one chord to another,&quot; he simply means you can&apos;t<br/>have all our major and minor triads in all keys pure. So what else is<br/>new? So what do we do? We take from the one and give to the other,<br/>i.e. we accept some impurity in some consonances in order to give a<br/>little improvement to the ones that turn out badly distorted.</p><p>Now, what precisely is being &quot;tempered&quot;, i.e. diluted, softened,<br/>qualified, moderated, etc., all the normal meanings of the word<br/>temper? Is it the hard, rigid stability of the pure intervals, or is<br/>it the harshness of those which come out like hideously deformed<br/>freaks? Hard to know. I would argue that Werckmeister means to<br/>&quot;temper&quot; the rigidity of simple proportions, since at the top of his<br/>tables in the 1681 treatise he says, &quot;hereby the tempering<br/>(temperatur) or hovering (schweben) can be found out in different<br/>ways.&quot; And what specific information does said table provide? The<br/>deviation from pure of all of the fifths and major thirds, specified<br/>in fractions of a comma. Seems pretty clear to me. He does not say,<br/>&quot;hereby the improvement of malformed consonances can be found out in<br/>different way,&quot; now does he? Ultimately, though, I think it doesn&apos;t<br/>really matter as long as we realize we are creating an approximation<br/>of an unreachable ideal, that being the use of pure consonances for<br/>every triad.</p><p>I think it is wrong to ask which specific system or which specific<br/>tuning Werckeister had in mind as the starting point to deviate from.<br/>The answer is NO system, just an idealized consistent use of pure<br/>consonances, which is on any instrument which is comprise of discrete<br/>fixed pitch oscillators is unobtainable, unless there are lots and<br/>lots of &apos;em. That&apos;s why I don&apos;t agree that a temperament is always an<br/>approximation of some definite tuning. If pressed, I would have to say<br/>that all traditional temperaments are approximations of an<br/>unrestrained flexible 5-limit JI applied independently to each and<br/>every harmony.

In der<br/>Musiktheorie der Renaissance wurde der Begriff wieder aufgenommen und<br/>unterschiedlich verwendet. In der Musik des 16. Jahrhunderts finden<br/>wir daher zweierlei Bedeutungen.[1]</p><p>    * Zum einen waren beispielsweise in der neunzehnstufigen Stimmung<br/>bei Guillaume Costeley mit enharmonischen T&ouml;nen T&ouml;ne unterschiedlicher<br/>H&ouml;he gemeint.<br/>    * Zum anderen gab es in den als gleichstufig bezeichneten<br/>Lautenstimmungen derselben Zeit eine Enharmonik mit jeweils denselben<br/>Tonorten.</p><p>Gegen Ende des 17. Jahrhundert erm&ouml;glichten die Wohltemperierten<br/>Stimmungen s&auml;mtliche enharmonischen Verwechslungen auf jeweils<br/>denselben Tonorten. Mit der M&ouml;glichkeit, - &uuml;ber die Begrenzungen der<br/>mittelt&ouml;nigen Stimmungen hinaus - auch Cis und Des, Es und Dis, F und<br/>Eis, Fis und Ges, Gis und As, B und Ais sowie C und His enharmonisch<br/>nicht nur in melodischem, sondern auch in harmonischem Zusammenhang zu<br/>verwenden, standen nun s&auml;mtliche Tonarten des Quintenzirkels und deren<br/>Akkorde sogar f&uuml;r ein Musikst&uuml;ck zur Verf&uuml;gung. Die Rezitative des<br/>Sp&auml;tbarock sind geradezu gepr&auml;gt durch ihre intensive Ausnutzung<br/>enharmonischer Fortschreitungen. Als bedeutendes Element der<br/>Modulation mit Hilfe der enharmonischen Verwechslung wurde der<br/>Verminderte Septakkord entdeckt, dessen vier T&ouml;ne jeweils eine<br/>klingende kleine Terz auseinander stehen und sich vielf&auml;ltig umdeuten<br/>lassen.</p><p>Ob eine Enharmonische Verwechslung durchgef&uuml;hrt werden konnte, hing<br/>also vom verwendeten Stimmungssystem ab. Je n&auml;her dieses der<br/>Wohltemperierten Stimmung und schlie&szlig;lich der Gleichstufigen Stimmung<br/>kam, desto zahlreicher und f&uuml;r das Geh&ouml;r tolerierbarer lie&szlig;en sich<br/>Enharmonische Verwechslungen verwenden.</p><p>In der Musik der Romantik wurde die Tonalit&auml;t immer mehr erweitert und<br/>begann sich im Laufe des 19. Jahrhunderts bei einigen Komponisten<br/>aufzul&ouml;sen. Dabei spielte die Enharmonik eine bestimmende Rolle, so z.<br/>B. bei Franz Schubert, Franz Liszt, und Richard Wagner und<br/>weiterf&uuml;hrend in das 20. Jahrhundert hinein z. B. bei Gabriel Faur&eacute;,<br/>Claude Debussy, Alexander Nikolajewitsch Skrjabin, Max Reger und dem<br/>fr&uuml;hen Arnold Sch&ouml;nberg, denen beispielsweise die enharmonische<br/>Umdeutung alterierter Akkorde fast grenzenlose Modulationen und eine<br/>nicht mehr unbedingt an einen Grundton gebundene Harmonik erm&ouml;glichte.[2]</p><p>In der weiteren Entwicklung hin zur Atonalit&auml;t (speziell in der<br/>Dodekaphonie und der ihr folgenden seriellen Kompositionsweise) verlor<br/>die Enharmonik jedoch weitgehend ihre bisherige funktionale Bedeutung.<br/>Bei enharmonischen Verwechslungen ging es oft nur noch um eine<br/>m&ouml;glichst pragmatische Notation und weniger um eine harmonische<br/>Umdeutungen eines Tones.[3] Folgerichtig wurden neue, zw&ouml;lfstufige<br/>Notationssysteme erfunden und teilweise in der Praxis verwendet, die<br/>keine enharmonischen T&ouml;ne mehr enthielten....&quot;</p><p>Altavista&apos;s<br/><a href="http://de.babelfish.yahoo.com/translate_txt">http://de.babelfish.yahoo.com/translate_txt</a><br/>converts that content almost literally into absolute nonsensial<br/><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pidgin">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pidgin</a><br/>in a disharmonic way:</p><p>&apos;Enharmoni mistake from Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia changes too:<br/>Navigation, search One calls Enharmoni mistake in the music<br/>kompositorische practice to regard tones as other tones, which have<br/>equivalent height, however different names to reinterpret e.g. Fis<br/>than Ges or His than C in equivalent tendency. Thus the musical<br/>connection and the function of the tones can be changed to cause e.g.<br/>in order the change into another kind of clay/tone (modulation). The<br/>term is only limited to equate with the term Enharmonik (see below),<br/>the one by far greater meaning importance einnimmt.[1 ] The twelve<br/>half-tones of the ascending, chromatically enriched c-Dur-Tonleiter<br/>are confounded in the second note line, the tones standing one above<br/>the other sound enharmonisch directly: align=left Here the different<br/>designations for the twelve tones of the level scale; Naturals are<br/>emphasized: His C Deses Hisis Cis of the Cisis D Eses Dis it Feses<br/>Disis E Fes ice F Geses Eisis Fis Ges Fisis G Ases (Asas) Gis As Gisis<br/>A Heses (!) Ais B (!) Ceses Aisis H Ces (this table can theoretical be<br/>extended after both sides; like that e.g. Gis and As are alike<br/>sounding with Fisisis and Heseses.) History of the Enharmonik and the<br/>Enharmoni mistake [ work on ] Enharmonik was in that antique music<br/>teachings beside Diatonik and Chromatik a name for a kind of the scale<br/>formation. In the music theory of the Renaissance the term was again<br/>taken up and used differently. In the music 16. Century find we<br/>therefore two different Bedeutungen.[1 ] * On the one hand were for<br/>example in the nineteen-level tendency meant with Guillaume Costeley<br/>with enharmonischen tones of tones of different height. * On the other<br/>hand there was a Enharmonik with in each case the same clay/tone<br/>places to than level designated sound tendencies the the same time.<br/>Toward end 17. The tendencies well-being-kept at a moderate<br/>temperature all enharmonischen mistakes on in each case the same<br/>clay/tone places made century possible. With the possibility, - beyond<br/>the delimitations of the mitteltoenigen tendencies - also Cis and, it<br/>and Dis, F and ice, Fis and Ges, Gis and As, B and Ais as well as C<br/>and His enharmonisch not only in melodischem of using but also in<br/>harmonious connection stood now all kinds of clay/tone of the<br/>Quintenzirkels and their chords even for a music piece to the<br/>Verfuegung.[1 ] the Rezitative of the late baroque are almost<br/>coined/shaped by their intensive utilization of enharmonischer<br/>spreads. As important element of the modulation with the help of the<br/>enharmonischen mistake the decreased Septakkord was discovered, whose<br/>four tones in each case a sounding small third can be reinterpreted<br/>apart and variously. Whether a Enharmoni mistake could be<br/>accomplished, depended thus on the used tendency system. The more near<br/>this the tendency well-being-kept at a moderate temperature and<br/>finally the equallevel tendency came, the more numerously and for the<br/>hearing could more tolerable Enharmoni mistakes be used.

He lists their equivalent names, but there is no &gt;&gt; mention of a temperament. In &quot;System der 53 reinen Intervalle&quot; he &gt;&gt; introduces the &quot;Focker block&quot; you see in figure III, where tones at &gt;&gt; the ends of a row differ by a schisma, and tones at the ends of a &gt;&gt; column differ by a kleisma. Only then does he propose a 53 tone &gt;&gt; temperament. He admits it is best realized by simply dividing the &gt;&gt; octave, but he meant to show that the 53 comma tuning is not just a &gt;&gt; place where the circle of fifths approximates closure, but that its &gt;&gt; necessity arises from &quot;harmony&quot;.<br/>&gt; &gt; He shows a chain of minor thirds, so he has the basic &gt; property of kleismatic temperament.  Maybe he didn&apos;t think &gt; of tempering it but the unison vector (presumably what the &gt; Verwechselung indicates) is in enough to define a &gt; temperament class.<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; There&apos;s also a rather obscure book by Liberty Manik that &gt;&gt;&gt; discusses the history of the term &quot;schismatische Verwechselung&quot;.<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt;  From Google Books, it appears Ellis translated &gt;&gt;&gt; &quot;schismatische Verwechse?lung&quot; as &quot;the skhismatic system&quot;. &gt;&gt;&gt; There&apos;s also a reference to &quot;[a] skhismatic temperament&quot; &gt;&gt;&gt; (but not plain &quot;skhismatic temperament&quot;).<br/>&gt;&gt; Since it means systematically taking one note for the other, why not?<br/>&gt; &gt; It loses the meaning of equivalence, though. Why? &quot;Verwechslung&quot; basically means &quot;mistaken identity&quot; The mistaking can be a matter of course (if the identity is indeed given in a temperament), or it can be between different, but negligibly different, entities. Ellis looks at the whole picture, where all the skhismata have a definite distance in the interval grid, already having in mind it will be bridged, Tanaka just lists where skhismata occur.</p><p>I have the feeling that enharmonic equivalence is used less in English than in German. This may be because I learned to read music in German. But if it&apos;s true, it could motivate a translator to look for another word that also conveys the idea. &quot;System&quot; can be a general stand-in for so much ...</p><p>Hence<br/>&gt; &quot;schismatic temperament&quot; became the term in English instead &gt; of &quot;schismatic equivalence&quot;.  What would it be in German?</p><p>I could be ... or ...

But as it could also apply to equal temperament families it isn&apos;t definitively wrong.  Depending on what a &quot;family&quot; of equal temperaments actually is.  See below.</p><p>&gt; Honestly, at this point i&apos;m totally confused about any<br/>&gt; difference (if there is one) between a temperament &quot;class&quot;<br/>&gt; and a temperament &quot;family&quot;. I wrote a page about &quot;family&quot;<br/>&gt; in my Encyclopedia early on, in hopes that it would help<br/>&gt; to standardize the terminology. But when Graham introduced<br/>&gt; &quot;class&quot; i think i was mostly on hiatus from these lists<br/>&gt; (which has happened several times in the last 3 years as<br/>&gt; i&apos;ve had to work on my website and on Tonescape) and i<br/>&gt; missed it.</p><p>Unfortunately I&apos;m now getting confused as well.  I thought &quot;equal temperament family&quot; and &quot;rank 2 temperament class&quot; were roughly synonymous, but now I&apos;m not so sure.</p><p>&gt; Any help in clarifying would be appreciated -- specifically,<br/>&gt; with a view towards my putting a &quot;class&quot; page into the<br/>&gt; Encyclopedia with a good explanation of the differences<br/>&gt; between &quot;class&quot; and &quot;family&quot; ... or an explanation of<br/>&gt; why both terms are used if they do mean the same thing.</p><p>You can add &quot;temperament class&quot; and I think &quot;a set of tempered tunings with the same mapping from just intonation&quot; is good enough as a definition.  At least, its meaning isn&apos;t in question.</p><p>The new meaning of &quot;family&quot; is Gene&apos;s, and so you&apos;ll have to defer to his definition.  But it&apos;s the next level of abstraction beyond &quot;class&quot;.  Temperament classes of the same family will have the same mapping for most, but not all, primes.  For example, in <a href="http://x31eq.com/diaschis.htm">http://x31eq.com/diaschis.htm</a> I talk about different 7-limit mappings.  So you could describe them as different temperament classes of the diaschismic family.</p><p>Now, there&apos;s *another* meaning of &quot;equal temperament family&quot; as I alluded to above.  Here, it consists of different equal temperaments that belong to the same higher rank class. Hence 12, 19, 31, e.t.c. belong to the meantone family. This is a term I still use on my website.  I don&apos;t intend to make revisionist changes so they&apos;ll have to count as obsolete usages if this is deemed to be obsolete.</p><p>I assumed that Gene&apos;s idea of temperament families was a natural extension of equal temperament families to a higher rank.  Maybe it is if you think about unison vectors (or whatever we&apos;re supposed to call them this week).  Equal temperaments belonging to the same rank 2 class will share unison vectors, as will different rank 2 temperament classes belonging to the same family.</p><p>The older meaning of &quot;linear temperament family&quot; isn&apos;t something you need to document because it was never widely used and is no longer accepted.  There are probably all kinds of uses of the word &quot;family&quot; for different things in the archives.  Another is a family of MOS scales (or equivalent terms) which means they share the same pattern of large and small intervals but different tunings.</p><p>                 Graham</p><p>P.S.

In tuning theory, this usually means one or more just intervals maps to a tempered interval.  For example, in 12 tone equal temperament 3:2 maps to 7 steps and 5:4 maps to 4 steps.  In meantone, 3:2 maps to a perfect fifth and 5:4 maps to a major third.</p><p>2) Gene&apos;s definition of &quot;prime mapping&quot; can go here.</p><p>Thanks to Carl for pointing out the ambiguity.

The term &quot;temperament class&quot; is unambiguous,<br/>because it has been around for a relatively short time and therefore<br/>has a precise meaning.  By contrast, the term &quot;temperament&quot; has been<br/>around for a very long time and has multiple meanings, the most usual<br/>being: 1) the process of altering just intervals to approximations<br/>thereof; and 2) a tempered tuning.  &quot;Temperament class&quot; (as Graham<br/>uses it) means neither of those, so your statement (because it uses a<br/>very general term to attempt to &quot;explain&quot; the meaning of a much more<br/>precise one) will almost certainly be misunderstood by (or, at least,<br/>would seem very odd to) anyone new to this list -- something like<br/>saying that &quot;pitch class&quot; is a term which means &quot;pitch&quot;. ;-(</p><p>&gt; &quot;Temperament family&quot; is a term coined by Gene, about<br/>&gt; which you can see his web pages (use <a href="http://archive.org">archive.org</a> for now)<br/>&gt; or search the archives.

Without reading<br/>Gene&apos;s web pages, I would be thinking that a &quot;temperament family&quot; is<br/>a set of &quot;temperaments&quot; (i.e., tempered tunings) having primes<br/>(especially those higher than 5) mapped the same way.</p><p>As an illustration of where I&apos;m coming from (and getting at), I think<br/>that this would be a good opportunity to put up one of the articles I<br/>wrote for Xenharmonikon 18 (prior to this discussion, and also prior<br/>to my exposure to the term &quot;temperament class&quot;):<br/><a href="http://xenharmony.wikispaces.com/space/showimage/Miracle.pdf">http://xenharmony.wikispaces.com/space/showimage/Miracle.pdf</a><br/>(Unless you were an XH subscriber or contributor, you probably<br/>haven&apos;t seen this yet!)</p><p>In my discussion of temperaments in general (and Miracle in<br/>particular), I used the word &quot;family&quot; 14 times to refer to various<br/>temperament classes.</p><p>Also, if you check the occurrences of the word &quot;temperament&quot; in that<br/>article, the only ones in which you *might think* I was using it to<br/>refer to a *temperament class* are those in which it was preceded by<br/>the word &quot;Miracle&quot;.

That<br/>Joseph&apos;s composition was in 72-ET rather than Miracle temperament<br/>(i.e., the minimax tuning) was a technicality that I was willing to<br/>overlook, inasmuch as I recognized that the difference between the<br/>blackjack scale in those two tunings was so small as to be<br/>insignificant (i.e., inaudible in this particular instance).  Had<br/>Joseph created &quot;Blackjack&quot; using a subset of 31-ET or 41-ET, I would<br/>not have made such a statement, because: 1) I had already tried both<br/>31-ET and 41-ET, and 2) I didn&apos;t consider either of those two tunings<br/>to be the Miracle temperament.</p><p>The fact remains that I was using &quot;Miracle temperament&quot; to refer to a<br/>tuning, not a temperament class (or &quot;temperament family&quot;).

If I had &gt; intended to discuss the latter, I would probably have used the &gt; term &quot;Miracle family&quot; (as I would now advocate &quot;Miracle class&quot; for &gt; that purpose).</p><p>I originally thought of &quot;starling temperament&quot; as a specific tuning, with generators of 312 and 388 cents. I notice my &quot;Warped Canon&quot; page uses the phrase &quot;meantone temperaments&quot;, but it alternates between &quot;porcupine temperaments&quot; and &quot;porcupine temperament&quot;. So I must already have been thinking of porcupine as a system of tempering, rather than a specific tuning.</p><p>&gt; Does the term &quot;equal temperament&quot; suggest a temperament class/family &gt; or a tempered tuning?  What about &quot;meantone temperament&quot; in general &gt; music dictionaries?</p><p>I suspect for most people outside this list, &quot;equal temperament&quot; means specifically what we call 12-EDO.</p><p>&gt; Is &quot;Werckmeister III&quot; a temperament?  Is &quot;meantone&quot; is a &gt; temperament?  What do you mean by each of those statements?  What &gt; will a music theorist outside this forum think you mean?</p><p>&quot;Werckmeister III&quot; is a temperament in the sense that it&apos;s a set of instructions for tempering. I think that might be a good enough definition to encompass all the things we&apos;ve been calling temperaments. Some temperaments (e.g. quarter-comma meantone) are very specific as to the tuning details, while others (like Werckmeister III) are described according to how you set up the tuning on an instrument. The set of instructions for setting up something like keemun or porcupine temperament allow for variation in the size of the generators.</p><p>&gt; I&apos;ve asked the foregoing questions to demonstrate that &quot;temperament&quot; &gt; is, outside of this forum, generally understood to mean &quot;tempered &gt; tuning&quot; but, within certain contexts (mostly in this forum), may also &gt; mean &quot;temperament class&quot;.  In other words, &quot;temperament&quot; is too &gt; general a term to use for a set of temperaments that have the same &gt; mapping, so you need some other term (such as &quot;temperament class&quot;) to &gt; clearly indicate that you&apos;re talking about *multiple tempered &gt; tunings*.</p><p>We used to call them &quot;linear temperaments&quot;, until it wasn&apos;t clear whether some of the things we were talking about actually fit the definition of &quot;linear temperament&quot;.</p></div><h3>monz &#x3C;joemonz@yahoo.com&#x3E;</h3><span>3/17/2008 6:11:49 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Hi George,</p><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;George D.

It would be ill-advised to redefine those in<br/>such a way as to exclude those meanings.</p><p>&gt; ...<br/>&gt; Even Wilson stressed the importance of maps, saying that 12-ET<br/>&gt; had both the schismatic and meantone maps within it.  That&apos;s<br/>&gt; extremely consistent with what we did on tuning-math.  And<br/>&gt; maybe I should ask: do you consider 12-ET to be in the<br/>&gt; meantone or schismatic temperament classes?</p><p>Both (although it&apos;s more usually identified with the meantone class,<br/>since that mapping spans fewer tones in the generator chain).  (But<br/>it seems that Graham thinks that an ET should not be a member of a<br/>rank 2 temperament class.)</p><p>&gt; ...<br/>&gt; Mathematicians have terms like &quot;pencil&quot;, &quot;flag&quot;, &quot;field&quot;,<br/>&gt; &quot;ring&quot;, &quot;space&quot;, to name a few.  They don&apos;t mean what they<br/>&gt; do in everyday life.  And IIRC, the math use of &quot;pencil&quot;<br/>&gt; predates the common one.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Today, academic music theory is owned by the &quot;music set<br/>&gt; theorists&quot;, formerly called &quot;serialists&quot; or &quot;the Vienna<br/>&gt; school&quot;.  What they do is not set theory in the mathematical<br/>&gt; sense, and is not very good music theory either.

As I just argued on tuning-math,<br/>&gt; this is a Good Thing when it improves our *understanding*<br/>&gt; of the phenomenon being discussed.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; In math class, you learned &quot;algebra&quot;.  It corresponded to<br/>&gt; something that had been called &quot;algebra&quot; for a very long<br/>&gt; time.  But in the 19th century, some folks came along and<br/>&gt; redefined the meaning of the word.

Maybe there&apos;s a problem with my simplistic distinction of classes and families but I think we understand what a class is.</p><p>Sometimes I do talk about equal temperament mappings as &quot;belonging to&quot; a rank 2 class.  I&apos;m not sure what the proper terminology for that should be.</p><p>&gt;&gt; But strictly speaking I&apos;m happy to say that equal &gt;&gt; temperaments as such don&apos;t belong to rank 2 classes, but may &gt;&gt; be identical with &quot;tunings&quot; or &quot;instances&quot; of them.  In &gt;&gt; practice that distinction&apos;s too picky to observe.<br/>&gt; &gt; It&apos;s possible to define an isosceles triangle in such a way that the &gt; definition doesn&apos;t exclude an equilateral triangle.

For us, then, &quot;family&quot; is the next category up from &quot;class&quot;.  That may be the wrong way round biologically (keep pots clean or family gets sick) but no matter.</p><p>&gt;&gt; As I understand it, in loose terms, a temperament is a &gt;&gt; tuning with a mapping from just intonation.<br/>&gt; &gt; Yes, and it&apos;s interesting that you said that without mentioning &gt; irrational ratios.</p><p>Ah, I certainly don&apos;t think it&apos;s helpful to exclude rational tunings, although there&apos;s a history of doing so.</p><p>&gt; The most serious objection I have with defining &quot;temperament&quot; in the &gt; way that you&apos;re defining &quot;temperament class&quot; is that it goes contrary &gt; to traditional usage of the word by *excluding* tempered tunings from &gt; the definition.  In other words, such historical tunings as 12-tone &gt; equal temperament, 1/4-comma meantone temperament, and Young&apos;s &gt; Temperament No. 2 would no longer be considered temperaments!  This &gt; would create a &quot;vast gap&quot; (as Cameron put it) between ourselves and &gt; folks outside the alternative tunings movement, and we&apos;d be opening &gt; ourselves up to ridicule -- which is the last thing we need.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; If Carl wants to refer to an entire class of tempered tunings by &gt; terms such as &quot;miracle temperament&quot; or &quot;schismatic temperament&quot; &gt; (which, in effect, *broadens* the definition of &quot;temperament&quot; to &gt; *include* abbreviation of the term &quot;temperament class&quot;), then that&apos;s &gt; okay with me (inasmuch as the qualifiers &quot;miracle&quot; and &quot;schismatic&quot; &gt; should make that clear).  But let&apos;s not *narrow* the definition &gt; of &quot;temperament&quot; to *exclude* tempered tunings, which is what the &gt; rest of the musical world has understood the term to mean for a great &gt; many years.</p><p>This is where I come in with my articles.  The term &quot;miracle temperament&quot; is certainly used as an idiom in these parts for the miracle temperament class.  But usually it&apos;s lacking an article.  So I don&apos;t think it can involve the definition of &quot;a temperament&quot; we&apos;re talking about here.  You could say it suggests a new term &quot;temperament&quot; as an uncountable noun, which I have no problem with.  The meaning would be something like &quot;all ways of tempering&quot;.  You could also argue that &quot;temperament&quot; should be a verb and any usage as an uncountable noun is irregular.  In which case anybody writing formal publications would have to be careful about it.  In these parts there&apos;s an informal usage of &quot;miracle temperament&quot; as an uncountable noun.  It doesn&apos;t broaden the definition of &quot;a temperament&quot; as a singular noun.</p><p>&gt; Nevertheless, I would be very wary about using the term &quot;meantone &gt; temperament&quot; to refer to a temperament class, because that term has a &gt; very long history of being used to specify the 1/4-comma tuning.  If &gt; one wants to abbreviate &quot;meantone temperament class&quot;, it would be &gt; better to say &quot;meantone class&quot;, so as not to be misunderstood.</p><p>No, &quot;meantone class&quot; on it&apos;s own is irregular.  You should say &quot;the meantone class&quot;.  Which is a bit of a mouthful as &quot;meantones&quot; should do.  Similarly, if you want to refer to a single temperament you should say &quot;the meantone temperament&quot;.  I don&apos;t know how common it is to lose the article in that case.  Fortunately the English language provides us with definite articles so it&apos;s possible to use them to remove the ambiguity as long as your readers understand what you&apos;re doing.</p><p>It&apos;s only with &quot;meantone&quot; that I think there&apos;s any ambiguity (and I thought we concluded before that the new meaning has a history older than these lists).  For other temperaments names have always been understood to refer to classes even if there wasn&apos;t a way to say so.  And in the context of multiple temperament classes you should always assume &quot;meantone&quot; is a class because that&apos;s the most helpful meaning.</p><p>&gt; In other words, let&apos;s formulate our definitions to reflect the way &gt; the terms have actually been used (both here and elsewhere).</p><p>Both here and elsewhere certain terms have been used inconsistently.</p><p>                     Graham</p></div><h3>Carl Lumma &#x3C;carl@lumma.org&#x3E;</h3><span>3/19/2008 10:11:41 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Graham wrote...</p><p>&gt; but the 72<br/>&gt; note equal temperament class can&apos;t belong to miracle because<br/>&gt; rank 2 classes can only contain rank 2 temperaments (however<br/>&gt; that&apos;s interpreted).</p><p>Dare I ask what an &quot;equal temperament class&quot; is?</p><p>&gt; Yes.

Now, if we&apos;re describing miracle temperament as a set of instructions for tuning an instrument, with suitable generator values you can follow those instructions to obtain a 72-equal tuning.

I can live with<br/>&gt; &quot;temperament class&quot;, but I think &quot;abstract temperament&quot; is<br/>&gt; obviously better.  If you&apos;re asking me.</p><p>Yes, I was asking.  Then would you approve of &quot;concrete temperament&quot;,<br/>and do you think that term is obviously better than &quot;tempered tuning&quot;?</p><p>The problem I have with the term &quot;concrete temperament&quot; is that it&apos;s<br/>not as clear as &quot;tempered tuning&quot; in pointing out the fact that the<br/>concept refers to a concrete *tuning*, as opposed to temperament in<br/>the &quot;abstract&quot; sense (whatever that means).  Likewise, the<br/>term &quot;abstract temperament&quot; would seem to be less clear<br/>than &quot;temperament class&quot;, inasmuch as it makes one think of<br/>temperament in general, without giving any clue that *classification*<br/>of temperaments is what this is all about.</p><p>&gt; ...<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; You seem to be under the misapprehension that you must -- or<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; are even in the position to -- coin terms.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; If new terms are being coined, or existing ones redefined, then<br/>&gt; &gt; *somebody* must be doing it.  If others here are doing it; why<br/>&gt; &gt; shouldn&apos;t I?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; The use of the term &quot;temperament&quot; to mean &quot;abstract temperament&quot;<br/>&gt; happened organically here since the mid &apos;90s.  Gene did provide<br/>&gt; precise definitions to capture that but coined no new terms<br/>&gt; where there was an existing one that would fit.  He did coin<br/>&gt; new terms for entirely new constructs, and then he was<br/>&gt; relentlessly attacked for making the terms too numerous.  Nobody<br/>&gt; but me seems to appreciate that he gave us precise definitions<br/>&gt; that for the first time enabled us to communicate and even do<br/>&gt; proofs without confusing eachother to pieces.  You can see in<br/>&gt; this thread Graham even confuses himself working out the<br/>&gt; terminology you&apos;re advocating!</p><p>FWIW, I didn&apos;t get the impression that he was confusing himself, and<br/>I think I understood perfectly well what he was saying.</p><p>OTOH, it seems to me that a lot of the terminology that Gene has<br/>suggested leaves more than a few of us scratching our heads.</p><p>If you&apos;re insisting that aspiring microtonal rock guitarist Joe<br/>Bloefish master the intricacies of Gene-speak in order to understand<br/>how porcupine or pajara are related to 22-equal, then I think we have<br/>a problem.  If you think that alternative tunings should be the<br/>exclusive property of a bunch of academic snobs, then maybe that&apos;s<br/>okay; but if not, then we ought to make a decent effort to use terms<br/>that will help to explain some of these things to folks who grew up<br/>in a pop culture (and just might want to expand their horizons a bit).</p><p>&gt; &gt; &gt; I did not coin<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; the use of the term &quot;temperament&quot; here over the last decade+,<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; I am merely pointing it out.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; But when someone like me, who&apos;s been around alternate tunings for<br/>&gt; &gt; decades, shows up here more recently, it&apos;s a bit disconcerting to<br/>&gt; &gt; discover that the tuning list is an isolated island on which<br/>&gt; &gt; tuning language has been evolving independently of the outside<br/>&gt; &gt; world and that some terms don&apos;t mean the same thing here as they<br/>&gt; &gt; do out there.<br/>&gt; &gt; That can make communication with the outside world much more<br/>&gt; &gt; difficult.  Is that what we want?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I&apos;ve never had any terminology problems communicating about<br/>&gt; tunings with the outside world, including early music<br/>&gt; specialists and performers, classically-trained musicians,<br/>&gt; rock musicians, people off the street, people in the music<br/>&gt; instrument business, piano tuners, and...</p><p>Why, then, don&apos;t you ask a few of those folks what they<br/>think &quot;meantone temperament&quot; and &quot;equal temperament&quot; are (as isolated<br/>terms, apart from any specific context) and see if their answers<br/>always agree with your (abstract) definition?</p><p>--George</p></div><h3>Carl Lumma &#x3C;carl@lumma.org&#x3E;</h3><span>3/24/2008 9:01:17 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>George - I&apos;m going to respectfully bow out of this thread.<br/>I&apos;ve said my peace.
