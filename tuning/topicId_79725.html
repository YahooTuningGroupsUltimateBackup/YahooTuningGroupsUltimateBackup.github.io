So that&apos;s<br/>what the focus has been on.</p><p>&gt; &gt; The n*d rule has been investigated substantially on this<br/>&gt; &gt; list, tuning-math, and the harmonic_entropy list in many<br/>&gt; &gt; listening tests. The rule is actually geomean(a*b*<br/>&gt; &gt; c...) for a chord a:b:c..., which includes sqrt(n*d) for<br/>&gt; &gt; dyads.  The largest listening test we did was actually<br/>&gt; &gt; done on tetrads.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Now if only we knew how to find those past experiments.</p><p>You can download the chords here:<br/><a href="http://www.soundclick.com/bands/page_music.cfm?bandID=105485">http://www.soundclick.com/bands/page_music.cfm?bandID=105485</a><br/>WARNING: Spoilers.

Surely the single notes do have<br/>this relation, that evokes something like consonance/dissonance.<br/>But in coming up with all-purpose rules of thumb like n*d,<br/>the goal is to take musical context out of the picture, and<br/>just compare whatever is inherent to the dyads.  To come up<br/>with something that works regardless of what pitches one roots<br/>them on.  So I&apos;m not sure if your analysis here is directly<br/>comparable to an effort like what we were discussing.</p><p>&gt; C G is 3 to 2 with one first order difference tone of 1. that<br/>&gt; gives us 6 if you add them all together. 7 is just the 7th<br/>&gt; harmonic by itself.</p><p>Gotcha.  Let me think.  3*2 = 6 and 3+2+(3-2)=6.  So they<br/>agree.  But in general, does</p><p>n * d = n + d + (n - d)</p><p>n * d = 2n</p><p>So the values are only the same when the denominator is 2.</p><p>But do they give the same ranking?  No.  Your measure is the<br/>same as twice the numerator, which is the same ranking as just<br/>using the numerator.  Not a bad ranking, but in comprehensive<br/>tests done in 1999 (involving me, monz, Dave K., Paul E,<br/>Daniel Wolf, Eduardo Sabat-Garibaldi, and others), we found<br/>that both the numerator and denominator contribute.</p><p>-Carl</p></div>
