Or<br/>&gt; is the presence of the 5th harmonic or a 5-limit interval in the<br/>&gt; scale (while everything else may have been fiddled with) reason<br/>&gt; enough to call the whole thing &quot;5-limit&quot;?

If they&apos;re tuned just, you call it &quot;5-limit<br/>JI&quot;.  5-limit scales are a fuzzier concept.  Some say any scale with<br/>5-limit intervals is a 5-limit scale, others that all notes have to be<br/>connected by 5-limit intervals.</p><p>               Graham</p></div><h3><a id=24502 href="#24502">ðŸ”—</a>klaus schmirler &#x3C;KSchmir@z.zgs.de&#x3E;</h3><span>6/7/2001 7:00:46 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Paul Erlich schrieb:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; --- In tuning@y..., klaus schmirler &lt;KSchmir@z...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; What are the language regulations for &quot;5-limit harmony&quot;, explained<br/>&gt; &gt; for a pedant?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; The term &quot;limit&quot; comes from Harry Partch. He primarily meant, &quot;all<br/>&gt; intervals using ratios with odd numbers up to and including 5 are<br/>&gt; considered consonant; other ratios are considered dissonant&quot;. Others<br/>&gt; after Harry Partch have tended to use &quot;limit&quot; to refer to the highest<br/>&gt; _prime_ number in a tuning system, rather than the highest _odd_<br/>&gt; number in a consonant chord. But this is a departure from Partch&apos;s<br/>&gt; primary usage. When the question is one of verticality, I think the<br/>&gt; odd specification makes a lot more sense than the prime one (since<br/>&gt; you can approximate _any_ interval with arbitrary accuracy using 5-<br/>&gt; prime-limit ratios -- thus the prime limit doesn&apos;t really tell you<br/>&gt; anything about the kind of harmonic sounds a composer may wish to<br/>&gt; use).

Secondary 5-limit ratios are ones which are not 5-odd-limit<br/>but can be formed by combining two 5-odd-limit ratios. You might also<br/>say that 34-tET uniquely articulates the primary intervals in (1 3 5<br/>9) -- that is, the intervals where the highest odd factor in the<br/>numerator is either 1, 3, 5, or 9, and the highest odd factor in the<br/>denominator is either 1, 3, 5, or 9 -- while 12-tET does not.</p></div>
