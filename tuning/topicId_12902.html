My schedule were modified by<br/>illness. I&apos;ll comment here your posts on August 22 and 24 that were pick<br/>out by research on word &quot;Pierre&quot;.</p><p>[Paul wrote (Aug 24) :]</p><p>&lt;&lt; Now, in anticipation of future discussions with Pierre, I&apos;ll do the same<br/>thing for an equiheptatonic (7-tET) scale. &gt;&gt;</p><p>I don&apos;t comment now for reason that scales and macrotonality will be theme<br/>on which I&apos;ll focus on my next posting session, later in september, with<br/>return of good shape.</p><p>[Paul wrote (Aug 22) :]</p><p>&lt;&lt; It is, at this point, a dyadid discordance measure, which certainly<br/>conforms to Pierre Lamothe&apos;s partial ordering for simple ratios &gt;&gt;</p><p>I&apos;ll post in block my last remarks on microtonality mainly about locally<br/>concordant tetrads that were described by Paul. I did&apos;nt yet theorize on<br/>microtonality. I was hoping to feed my thoughts by discussion on that but<br/>language barrier is too high for now. It&apos;s why I&apos;ll concentrate later,<br/>after these last microtonal posts, on what I can most contribute :<br/>coherence in algebraic macrotonal approach and musical modes hidden structure.</p><p>Next posts follow.</p><p>Pierre Lamothe</p></div>
