While some<br/>instruments are tuned so that octaves will beat (and tuned in<br/>stretched as well as narrowed octaves) there are plenty of examples<br/>of _pleng_, where the interval has been tuned beatless, a 2:1<br/>interval. It&apos;s a matter of the instrument tuner&apos;s and the patron&apos;s<br/>taste, the qualities of the individual pieces of metal, and also, a<br/>question of maintenance and laziness (bars, for example, are<br/>generally cast too high in pitch, so must be ground down, often a<br/>lazy tuner will just tune down enough to bring it into the<br/>neighborhood of an octave...). In any case, the assumption in the<br/>music itself, which could be thought of as simultaneous variation<br/>upon a single, unplayed, melody in several octaves, is that pitches<br/>separated by octaves, yes the pitch classes, belong to a single<br/>perceptual class.</p><p>Daniel Wolf<br/>Budapest<br/>--- End forwarded message ---</p></div><h3>jpehrson@rcn.com</h3><span>6/8/2001 12:30:26 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In tuning@y..., &quot;Paul Erlich&quot; &lt;paul@s...&gt; wrote:</p><p><a href="http://groups.yahoo.com/group/tuning/message/24431">http://groups.yahoo.com/group/tuning/message/24431</a></p><p>&gt; --- In metatuning@y..., &quot;Daniel James Wolf&quot; &lt;djwolf1@m...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; While the real or &quot;virtual&quot; pitch continuum and its harmonic<br/>&gt; combinatorial possibilities are available to any musician, we do<br/>have<br/>&gt; to deal with the prospect that the harmonic series, or a segment<br/>&gt; thereof, appears to be built into the programming or organic<br/>&gt; structure that evolution gave us for both music and language.

That&apos;s the problem with so many<br/>lists... some things are going to get lost in the &quot;shuttle...&quot;</p><p>Well, &quot;psychoacoustic graffiti&quot; is the way &quot;classical modernists&quot; of<br/>the 50&apos;s and 60&apos;s would view it.  I remember a concert of George<br/>Perle&apos;s music at Merkin Hall, where one of the string players played<br/>a major triad on the piano to &quot;tune up&quot; and the audience of mostly<br/>composers laughed.</p><p>Well... the PERFORMER was still using it, so, essentially it was so<br/>ingrained that it was no &quot;laughing matter...&quot;</p><p>________ ________ ______<br/>Joseph Pehrson</p></div>
