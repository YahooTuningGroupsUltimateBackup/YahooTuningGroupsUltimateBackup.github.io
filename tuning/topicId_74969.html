You can see how the construction works with the hexany in the hypercube - in the diagram on the new wkipedia page:<br/><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hexany#Tuning">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hexany#Tuning</a><br/>scale the whole thing down by a scale factor of 1/2 about the origin (blue vertex) and the octahedron vertices will all lie on the midpoints of the edges of the tetrahedron.</p><p>If that&apos;s not immediately obvious - note that each vertex is originally at the far vertex of a square away from the origin (with one blue, one yellow and two red vertices) , so scaling the whole diagram by a factor of 1/2 takes the yellow vertex to the midpoint of the  original square and that also takes it to the midpoints of the edges of the tetrahedron with the red vertices.</p><p>Similarly in 5-dimensions, after a 1/2 saling, the dekany vertices will lie on the midpoints of the edges of the 4-simplex and in six dimensions, after the same scaling, the pentadekany vertices will lie on the mid points of the edges of the 5-simplex, and so on in all the higher dimensions.</p><p>Perhaps I&apos;ll add a note to the article to that effect.</p><p>I&apos;ve done a web search for uniform dodecatetron, and nothing has turned up. Do you know any more about it?</p><p>I think names of five and higher dimensional solids belong to a fairly recondite area of geometry, apart from the hypercube, simplex (generalised tetrahedron) and cross set (generalised octahedron). So it&apos;s perhaps not too surprising that nothing turned up.</p><p>So, in Dave Keenan&apos;s figure you can replace the ?? by rectified 5-simplex, (or rectified hexateron).</p><p>I&apos;ve usually seen it written as 5-simplex rather than 5D simplex. But a search for &quot;5D simplex&quot; turns up a fair number of results so I expect they are alternate spellings. 5-simplex seems to be the one most commonly used at least on the web.</p><p>Thanks,</p><p>Robert</p></div><h3><a id=74978 href="#74978">ðŸ”—</a>Robert walker &#x3C;robertwalker@robertinventor.com&#x3E;</h3><span>2/7/2008 5:41:39 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Hi Daniel,</p><p>Yes, sounds great. As it&apos;s wikipedia you can add those yourself if you like.</p><p>I&apos;m not going to do too much on it myself, until I see what happens to it. (Anyway I&apos;ve still got rather a lot on right now, I mean more than usual for me - lots of immediate post release things to do to do with the web site).</p><p>I gather that often articles on Wikipedia may get deleted, or cut right down to a single paragraph, so it doesn&apos;t make much sense to work too much on it until we find out if that happens or not.</p><p>I think the reference to the article in 1/1 may &quot;tick the right boxes&quot; for someone who looks at it to see if it is a candidate for deletion, since it is a reference to a printed article in a journal subject to editorial review. At least I hope so. But it mightn&apos;t prevent someone from deciding it is too long and should be just a single paragraph.</p><p>Yes I agree a separate article on CPS makes sense, but again, idea was to start small. If it is left untouched for a few months maybe it can become a seed for more articles on the subject.</p><p>The link to Combination Product Sets from Erv Wilson&apos;s page was broken, so I redirected it to the hexany for now. Perhaps there used to be an article on CPS that has already been deleted? Though I can&apos;t find anything in the wayback machine.</p><p>There must be lots of good material that got deleted from wikipedia. It would be interesting if they had a &quot;wikipedia rejects&quot; site though one can understand why they don&apos;t as it would be an invitation for contributors to add even more material that doesn&apos;t belong.</p><p>Anyway don&apos;t want to discourage anyone else from editing it - and improving it. Pariticularly I expect the more references one can add to it the better, especially if they are printed articles in a journal with an editor. I don&apos;t know if I&apos;m being over cautious there - I&apos;ve been somewhat warned off doing too much work on it for the time being by some of the posts I&apos;ve seen here about deleted material on wikipedia. But the current banner I think isn&apos;t too serious - looked it up and it means that whoever added it feels it is probably suitable for inclusion, but just needs more work on it. That was before I added the 1/1 ref.</p><p>Robert</p></div><h3><a id=74979 href="#74979">ðŸ”—</a>Robert walker &#x3C;robertwalker@robertinventor.com&#x3E;</h3><span>2/7/2008 5:48:03 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Hi Krag,</p><p>I&apos;ve just expanded the section that explains why you can easily see from the diagram that the octahedron is regular. That was the main reason for including a diagram there, which perhaps wasn&apos;t clear, the reason for putting it in.</p><p>The idea was to show its four dimensional context, particularly, and make it easy to see that the polyhedra are regular - well as easy as could be expected - which I think it does reasonably well??</p><p>One expects to find the projection baffling, if one tries to make sense of it, tries to fit it all together into a single picture - unless one happens to be one of the very very few people who are able to think four dimensionally, such as Alicia Stott.</p><p>Also one can see that by just rotating the diagram around, then there are four ways of finding the octahedron corresponding to the four major diagonals of the hypercube. Though I don&apos;t know if that has any musical significance particularly. There may be other things that it may be useful for, that particular projection, it&apos;s a very commonly used projection of the hypercube, very symmetrical. well expect you know that, anyway that may perhaps make it easier to see some things.</p><p>As it&apos;s wikipedia anyone who wants to add more material or better versions, or edit anything that&apos;s confusing can just go ahead and do it.</p><p>BTW the quality I&apos;m sure could be improved too.
