The mkii countpart<br/>also is known to have a somewhat sluggish keyboard due to some processing<br/>problems, so the TX802 is probably your best bet as Mr. Lumma suggests since<br/>sluggish processing isn&apos;t really known to be a problem on the TX802.</p><p>As far as a controlling keyboard, you will probably want a keyboard of at<br/>least 61 keyboard to have some room to play. I really wouldn&apos;t suggest a<br/>keyboard any smaller unless you play strictly in &quot;step&quot;. Fatar makes some<br/>so-so controller keyboards, but if you have some money to spend, I would eye<br/>a used 76 or 88 controller keyboard (Yamaha, Peavey, Oberheim, and Kurzweil<br/>all made one). In my opinion, since the keyboard is the part you will be<br/>&quot;hanging onto&quot; for awhile, it may be where you should spend most of your<br/>money, since it is the part you will be dealing with the most.</p><p>If you don&apos;t mind limitations to the octave for scaling, you should be able<br/>to get 650 +/- cents for each note in that octave on Kurzweil&apos;s K1000/K1200<br/>keyboards and 1000 AX,PX,SX,GX and HX modules (the difference is the sounds<br/>onboard). I like Kurzweil equipment, although the limitation of an octave<br/>can be a tad irritating.</p><p>&gt; Carl Lumma &lt;<a href="mailto:CLUMMA@NNI.COM">CLUMMA@NNI.COM</a>&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;&gt; My parents are ready to buy me a microtunable synthesizer/keyboard of my<br/>&gt;&gt; choice.
