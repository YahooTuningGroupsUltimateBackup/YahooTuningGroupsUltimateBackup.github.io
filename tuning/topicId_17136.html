No. :-)</p><p>Tee hee. Thanks for a good chuckle Joseph.</p><p>It was one of those ideas that come while you&apos;re lying in bed<br/>intending to go to sleep. I knew if it was a dumb idea, someone on the<br/>lsit would tell me so, in the nicest possible way. And they did.<br/>Thanks Paul and John.</p><p>I haven&apos;t done the experiment with the sinker yet. But I see now the<br/>nonlinearity John referred to. Good experiment. It&apos;d have to be a very<br/>small one down near the bridge-end though, and crimped tightly to the<br/>string. You can even get split sinkers so you wouldn&apos;t have to take<br/>the string off to thread it on.</p><p>The questions then are:<br/>1. By what proportion would you have to incresse the diameter of the<br/>string uniformly above the first fret in order to lower its pitch by<br/>29 cents (the difference between 25/24 and a 12-tET semitone).<br/>Probably way too much.<br/>2. How bad will the inharmonicities be (we&apos;d use conical tapers or<br/>something between sections)<br/>3. How standard are guitar necks? Certainly absolute pitch is well<br/>standardised. How much would the string stretch as it aged. Could we<br/>compensate to some degree by taking up slack at the bridge?</p><p>I think number 1 is the real killer since it affects how much the<br/>other two matter.</p><p>Regards,<br/>-- Dave Keenan</p></div><h3>Paul Erlich &#x3C;PERLICH@ACADIAN-ASSET.COM&#x3E;</h3><span>1/6/2001 8:47:12 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@egroups.com">tuning@egroups.com</a>, &quot;Joseph Pehrson&quot; &lt;pehrson@p...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt; Am I following this correctly, but David Keenan suggested making<br/>&gt; guitar strings with different and varying densities through there<br/>&gt; lengths, and Paul Erlich countered by affirming that there would be<br/>&gt; incredible inharmonicity in such an arrangement?
