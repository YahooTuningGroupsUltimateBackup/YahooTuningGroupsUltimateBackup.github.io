In this<br/>case, I&apos;d usually play something like C-G-E-Bb, which would sound kind<br/>of like a 7-limit bluesy dominant 7 chord, and then I&apos;d throw the B-F#<br/>on top of it and it&apos;d &quot;activate&quot; a new sound I&apos;d never heard before,<br/>connecting things in different ways.</p><p>If you don&apos;t think that 12-equal is accurate enough to really give you<br/>7-limit harmony, you can try for yourself loading it up in 22-equal or<br/>31-equal and seeing that the &quot;feeling&quot; stays the same, while the<br/>intonation improves. For example, I did a similar excursion here, at<br/>the end of this porcupine-tempered Happy Birthday piece:</p><p><a href="http://soundcloud.com/mikebattagliamusic/happy-birthday">http://soundcloud.com/mikebattagliamusic/happy-birthday</a></p><p>I played a few trippy chords like this when I went up to Paul Erlich&apos;s<br/>place a while ago. I&apos;m now realizing that what I discovered without<br/>knowing it were higher-limit &quot;dyadic chords,&quot; and that the way that<br/>they mix flavors together is similar to the way that an<br/>875/864-tempered diminished chord mixes the flavor of &quot;diminished&quot; and<br/>&quot;rooted/otonal&quot; together (because three 6/5&apos;s makes a 7/4, giving you<br/>7/4 on the outer dyad).</p><p>Such explorations in 12-equal have generally been known as<br/>&quot;polytonality,&quot; but a lot of the most beautiful polytonal harmonies<br/>seem to make sense as higher-limit necessarily tempered harmonies in<br/>this way. I note that Stravinsky managed to hit these sorts of<br/>sonorities more than other people, who treated polytonality more<br/>aleatorically and didn&apos;t &quot;get it.&quot; So it might be worthwhile to go<br/>back through some polytonal compositions and see how they lay out in<br/>this fashion, retuning the &quot;polytonal chords&quot; as higher-limit tempered<br/>chords with greater accuracy.</p><p>-Mike</p></div>
