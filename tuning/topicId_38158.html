Seems a rather limited view<br/>Science is always right? It all depends who is doing it and for what purpose.<br/>Is the Big Bang repeatable?<br/>the same condition are never the same. the water is not the same water nor are we in the same<br/>place in the universe.<br/>What is consciousness?<br/>Are GMO good and safe, the scientist says that pollen will not go a mile down the road while it<br/>circles the globe. This is science, it is never separate from politics or money.<br/>You assume that religion is in books<br/>I don&apos;t read holy books because these are for the most part books of ethics having nothing to do<br/>with religion. the bible has more statements about now having sex with animals (I guess the<br/>followers needed to be told this ) than any cosmological syntax.<br/>    Science applied to music has ran across a brick wall. It just won&apos;t behave and the rationalist<br/>can stand it so they would rather impose their &quot;interaction of formal relations&quot; and drive those<br/>of their tribe to more furtive ground than admit science limitations. It works well with Beethoven<br/>but fails with Tchaikovsky (and most people prefer the latter)<br/> What i am talking about is science&apos;s limit not that it hasn&apos;t produced good result. When it is<br/>believed it can be applied to everything and is infallible it becomes indistinguishable from a<br/>religion.</p><p>Mark Gould wrote:</p><p>&gt; And there was me thinking it was a systematic body of provable, repeatable<br/>&gt; relationships between quantifiable properties of material objects.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Tell me, which holy books have you been reading lately...<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Next, we&apos;ll be told that fossils were Divine fiction.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; From: <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a><br/>&gt; &gt; Reply-To: <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a><br/>&gt; &gt; Date: 23 Jun 2002 09:08:24 -0000<br/>&gt; &gt; To: <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a><br/>&gt; &gt; Subject: [tuning] Digest Number 2121<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; Science is a religion.

The difference between science and most (but<br/>not all) religion is that in science _all_ ideas are fair game. But<br/>scientists are human, and many individuals and sometimes large groups<br/>get stuck in a rut for a long time, but science as a whole and science<br/>as a method is all about recognising and avoiding the many ways that<br/>we fool ourselves, and never stays stuck for very long.</p><p>Mark Gould:<br/>&gt; &gt; And there was me thinking it was a systematic body of provable,<br/>repeatable<br/>&gt; &gt; relationships between quantifiable properties of material objects.</p><p>This goes too far in the other direction.
