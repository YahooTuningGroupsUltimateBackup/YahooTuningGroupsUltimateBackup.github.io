But I do not<br/>think that it is due a physical coupling.</p><p>I think it is only the skill of the players that makes JI possible<br/>(more or less like in polyphonic singing). As far as I know,<br/>the fine tuning is made with the lips on single reeds and brasses.<br/>I am not sure for double reeds, flute and recorders, but I think<br/>that the fine tuning is always under the absolute control of the<br/>player.</p><p>Bad beginners can easilly miss a simple unison and stay consistentl<br/>out of tune on sustained notes (if you ever heard a class of kids<br/>in their first year of clarinet, you know what I mean). If there<br/>as such thing as a significant physical coupling that would not be<br/>possible.</p><p>It may be true that once JI is reach, sound production is more<br/>efficient, but I do not know if they are physically more efficient<br/>(less random destructive interference), psychoacousticaly more<br/>efficient (sound louder) or if it is only an effect feeled by<br/>the player and not really by the audience.</p><p>I have some doubt about constructive interference, because even<br/>if we make the hypothesis that perfect phase synchronisation<br/>between instruments can be achieved, phase reinforcement<br/>can increase loudness only if the distance between different<br/>sources is much shorter than wavelength. If distance between<br/>sources is greater, interference is not uniform in space:<br/>depending on the location of the auditor, interference is<br/>constructive or destructive.</p><p>For a real world wind ensemble, the critical distance may be<br/>respected if instrument are really close: it may the case for a<br/>fundamental frequency of an unison in mid range: 400-500 Hz -&gt;<br/>wavelength around 75-150cm. For a given distance<br/>between sources, coupling should more and more efficent<br/>as pitch goes down.</p><p>But critical distance goes down if we talk about JI interval more<br/>complex than unison. For instance for a JI fifth, critical distance<br/>is 3 time less than for unison, for a fourth, it is 4 time less, major<br/>third 5 time less etc. Physical coupling become less and less likely</p><p>Further, the way you experience the coupling is certainly quite<br/>different when you are player/singer than when you are in the<br/>audience. As a choir bass, I experienced the wonderful feeling<br/>of being coupled in a perfect unison with a church organ playing<br/>full-stops. In that case you have the impression to sing louder<br/>because you feel the resonance of the other instrument.<br/>In that case you can get in phase with the organ sound wave at<br/>the location where you vocal tract is: a few meters away (at most),<br/>phase is totally random and the effect diseappears.</p><p>I have no idea to substanciate the hypothesis that in tune<br/>nstruments may sound louder for psyhoaccoustic reasons.<br/>But may be I miss something.</p><p>In conclusion, as you state, it is probably the assurance effect that<br/>may be the most important one.</p><p>yours truly</p><p>Fran&ccedil;ois Laferri&egrave;re</p><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, Carl Lumma &lt;ekin@l...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt; What actually happens when winds play together in JI, verses<br/>&gt; being a some cps off?

The idea was more or less dismissed but for the major<br/>thirds (which are only one pipe away due to the symetrical setup of<br/>the pipes). But maybe, coupling of more distant pipes is still<br/>possible<br/>by wave propagation through the wood of the buffet?</p><p>If I could have a sound example of pipe organ let say with separate<br/>C, E, G (or equivalent intervals),<br/>then CE, CG EG sustained long enough, that would be sufficient to<br/>check if such coupling exists. If somebody think of such an exemple<br/>in one Bach piece, I would be able to analyse it from a commercial<br/>CD from my collection and check if pitch shift is measureable.</p><p>By the way there are astounding exemples of biological phase locking<br/>for low frequencies.

Biolumiscent insects on a tree,<br/>bioluminescent plancton).</p><p>On very low frequency side, a very peculiar long term synchronisation<br/>of hormonal cycles has observed on groups of ewes.</p><p>It seems that phase locking is everywhere, given that it is<br/>physically possible to do wrt critical distance.</p><p>yours truly</p><p>Fran&ccedil;ois Laferri&egrave;re</p></div>
