I presume he &quot;overdubbed&quot; the entire thing rather than<br/>using a sequencer... they weren&apos;t much in use with computers in<br/>1980...  Also wonder about the way he used his *greater than 12*<br/>scales on the *physical* keyboard.</p><p>Getting to the *esthetic* part of this, though, I feel after<br/>listening and thinking about this for a while that Blackwood is<br/>primarily intent on viewing these various octave-division scales<br/>through the prism of our traditional harmony and diatonicism.</p><p>There&apos;s nothing particularly wrong with that, but I feel it is a<br/>clear bias.  Hence, many of his comments in the CD liner that such<br/>and such a scale has &quot;bad&quot; triads or &quot;bad&quot; linear scales and so on,<br/>so he&apos;ll work around them or direct the piece a different way...</p><p>And, this means more than just using sonorities that follow the<br/>overtone series as 12-tET does... I think he&apos;s even intent on<br/>following traditional *functional harmony* to as great an extent as<br/>is possible in any given scale.</p><p>For this reason, I believe a listener will find that the scales that<br/>*allow* the greatest traditional harmonic manipulation, such as 19-<br/>tET get the *most* conservative treatment of them all... in this case<br/>the piece sounds like Bach...</p><p>It&apos;s basically like looking at ETs with &quot;traditional 12-equal<br/>functional harmonic&quot; glasses.</p><p>Nothing particularly wrong with that, but it certainly contrasts with<br/>somebody who finds all the particular *strengths* of a tuning, be it<br/>traditional or not, and &quot;runs with it&quot; to make something entirely new.</p><p>Blackwood is also *very* light on the metric variation end (makes<br/>some of my *own* music, incredibly, seem like Elliott Carter or some<br/>such.. :) and he&apos;s also very light on timbral variation, when<br/>compared to any of our *real* electronic composers, not that that is<br/>what he&apos;s after.</p><p>So, in the end, the works seem more like fascinating *studies* than<br/>as fully developed and competent works of microtonal music.</p><p>Of course, maybe that&apos;s why they&apos;re called &quot;Etudes!&quot;</p><p>Very enjoyable and interesting, though.</p><p>Anybody else have a similar &quot;take?&quot;</p><p>Joe Pehrson</p></div><h3><a id=41616 href="#41616">ðŸ”—</a>Kyle Gann &#x3C;kgann@earthlink.net&#x3E;</h3><span>12/22/2002 3:52:03 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Hi Joe,</p><p>I concur about Blackwood&apos;s etudes.
