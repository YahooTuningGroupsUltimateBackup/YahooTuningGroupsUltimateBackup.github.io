Therefore it *had* to be<br/>Werckmeister. Adn not only that, it had to be Werck III.</p><p>3) combinations of the above, ad nauseum....</p><p>Tom, Aaron, others say:</p><p>1) Just because some tuning was published doesn&apos;t mean Bach didn&apos;t<br/>have an unpublished solution. Do we really think Bach is so mechanical<br/>and unoriginal that he would, hmmm---experiment? In fact, Johnny even<br/>goes to great lengths to insist Bach was cocky. Let&apos;s say we agree he<br/>was &apos;cocky&apos;--taken at face value, why would he simply copy an existing<br/>tradition without &quot;putting his stamp&quot; on it?</p><p>ANSWER:  The above is hogwash, fantasy land.  Bach did not order a retuning of any organ as far as history is concerned.  He walked into situations where there was an organ ALREADY tuned.  You are the cocky one, Aaron.</p><p>2) CPE Bach said &quot;temper most fifths&quot; --a decidly UN-Werckmeister III<br/>description. Johnny will have to explain why the ultra-orthodox (his<br/>view, not ours) Bach family would suddenly change its tempering<br/>habits. CPE spoke for Papa Bach in more ways than one---for instance,<br/>insisting his Dad (and he, the bearer of the tradition) were<br/>anti-Rameau harmonic theory.</p><p>ANSWER:  CPE was writing at a different time, for a different court, when music had moved to the classical paradigm of melody over chords.  CPE is irrelevant to the question of Bach&rsquo;s tuning.  Similarly, Kirnberger shifted his tuning for the SAME reasons as CPE, if with different results.</p><p>3) If Bach cared, if he thought his music would be spoiled by the<br/>&quot;wrong temperament&quot;, he would have left detailed instructions on how<br/>to set the right temperament.</p><p>JR:  Exactly!</p><p>A:  The horrible truth Johnny, it hurts you<br/>we know, is that Bach&apos;s music is _greater than tuning_. Believe it or<br/>not, it is not an error to enjoy the countless non-AFMM recordings in<br/>non-Werckmeister out there. Nor is at error to (gasp!) enjoy Bach in<br/>12-equal (horrors!!!). If not, let&apos;s burn all the lute music he wrote<br/>in error, for certainly 12-equal is a mistake. Let&apos;s not forget that<br/>it is *we* who are in the tuning group caring so much about something<br/>that most of the time matters the least about music. Tuning is NOT a<br/>foreground feature of Bach&apos;s music, like it is in say Partch, or<br/>Renaissance vocal music. It is UTTERLY INSANE to argue otherwise. It<br/>would be equivalent to saying it utterly fails in 12-equal, which it<br/>doesn&apos;t---Renaissance music I agree mostly fails in 12-equal--not Bach.</p><p>ANSWER:   You are ranting.  And you are wrong.<br/>From a historical point of view, the Bach family preferring to use well-temperament, before it had ever been written about, is entirely a tuning issue.  Your purview of tuning as based off of a non-12 ET paradigm is inappropriate for this list.   It offers nothing on Bach.  That Bach works in ET is no surprise, it works in any tuning.</p><p>4) &apos;It&apos; (assuming there is ONE HOLY TUNING---an error---see below)<br/>doesn&apos;t have to be Neidhardt, it could be related or whatever.</p><p>Johnny:  You think this is good scholarship?</p><p>Aaron:  We will<br/>never know exactly. It&apos;s ok to be ok with not knowing. Not knowing<br/>keeps mystery in life. We don&apos;t need to know everything. That<br/>said--Neidhardt *might* (again the tentative nature of all speculative<br/>thought is emphasized---how radical!) represent a later publishing of<br/>a distillation of cultural trends for well-temperament that were alive<br/>in some way, *perhaps* in musical families like Bach&apos;s, especially<br/>given that Neidhardt had contact with Bach family members.</p><p>Johnny:  It seems that you may have a chronological malady.  Maybe you think Bach used time travel to go to the future to meet Neidhardt, only to return to an earlier date to use it, possibly to inform his whole family.</p><p>Aaron:  So, it&apos;s quite possible that Neidhardt tuning recipe(s) might be the closest<br/>published tuning(s) at the time to what Bach&apos;s personal recipe(s)<br/>might have been.</p><p>Johnny: In bizzarro world.  Rather than accept what is there in history -WIII (and which works as pointed out by Gene and Carl), you would rather deny its likelihood for the fantasy of unknown experiments.</p><p>Aaron:  Not to radical a statement really, given the way the<br/>world works when you really look at it. The anachronism doesn&apos;t<br/>necessarily apply---an idea may be around for decades before someone<br/>publishes, after all. You&apos;d have to prove that all ideas are published<br/>AS SOON AS POSSIBLE to disagree.</p><p>ANSWER:  Actually, no.  I have only to produce excellent performances, or to aid in the production of excellent performances.  I have already volunteered that musicologists have failed on this issue.  In fact, universities, colleges, and conservatories have all failed to incorporate what we on this list take for granted.</p><p>5) The plurals in parentheses above really bring us around to the main<br/>issue one might have Johnny&apos;s ultra-fascist conception---Why does Bach<br/>need ONE HOLY TUNING? Jesus, why does anyone? Can&apos;t the guy like<br/>variety? Do we screw ONLY in missionary position? There is not one<br/>compelling reason for Bach to feel like there was a single &apos;holy<br/>grail&apos; temperament, to be used always and forever, Amen.</p><p>ANSWER:  First off, your religious allegory (no doubt related to personal trauma in your family) is inappropriate here, as I have said to you before.  Secondly, my musical practice is to include all tunings, including ET.  I am sorry that you have an inability to be flexible on this issue, only to conclude that I must be inflexible.  You also fail to recognize that WIII contains different tunings within its variegation.  And you misunderstand the Bach family involvement, at a time in Thuringia when they were the cutting edge chromaticists.  They were microtonalists for their age.  Everyone else was in meantone.</p><p>Bach is critical to a proper understanding of what we call Western Art Music.<br/>I am truly disappointed that this appears as ad nauseum to some.</p><p>Aaron:  Ok, this is tiring. It really has gotten beyond lame. This thread MUST<br/>DIE. Sorry for keeping it alive well beyond what it ultimately merits.</p><p>-A.</p><p>ANSWER:  If there is no further interest, I retire from the list.</p><p>Johnny<br/>________________________________________________________________________<br/>Check out the new AOL.

In resonse to your comments:</p><p> &quot;At this stage, I don&apos;t see how anyone can be<br/>*certain* what JS Bach&apos;s preferred tunings were<br/>but I do believe that the intuitions of performers<br/>and scholars alike are valuable indicators in<br/>assessing the probability of him using one or<br/>another tuning. Still, it can&apos;t hurt any of us<br/>to continue to listen to other viewpoints with an<br/>open mind.&quot;</p><p>J: That&apos;s fair.  Essentially, as a result of following up my thesis paper called Bach&apos;s Tuning with further research and performances, I became more confident.  /thanks for listening!</p><p>&quot;What seems to me to be of paramount importance<br/>in choosing a tuning is to first determine the<br/>musical objectives of its use: What are the music-<br/>ians (composer, performer, conductor) trying to<br/>achieve? And it&apos;s also necessary to at least try<br/>to understand what motivates them: What are the<br/>driving forces behind their music? Which musical<br/>issues are they exploring and which are they<br/>ignoring? Without gaining a feeling for these<br/>things, I think that any speculation is just<br/>academic hot air.  Regards, Yahya&quot;</p><p>J: Yes, there is a superior value for using WIII in counterpoint that goes well with the rules about not crossing voices.  Each line has a greater etching, and more recognizeability.  ET fails this dimension of listening.  And its sequences sound trite in comparison.  As a practical musician, it seems almost silly that the obvously known tuning in a very small pool of musicians, amongst a decimated population (e.g., 30 years war, plague), would not be used as the defacto tuning for Bach.</p><p>And this is the reasons that musicians are tuning instruments in Werckmeister III.  I guess I have a different set of expectations of what people would constitute in this musical situation.  I can say that I have personally visited all the Bach cities.  It really does confirm what I have been saying.  You can see the unequalness represented on the Quedlinberg Church door (supposed the same door used by Werckmeister).</p><p>all best with all inquiries, Johnny<br/>________________________________________________________________________<br/>Check out the new AOL.
