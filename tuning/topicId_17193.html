How could one dislike a scale, or any musical<br/>phenomenon, by looking at equations? When one hears what Dan can do with<br/>the materials he works with, I think it&apos;s a good case for saying, as<br/>Ellington did about music in general, that there&apos;s no good or bad<br/>tunings, only good/bad music...Hstick</p></div>
