She<br/>&gt;expressed an  interest in them...<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;                      Maybe I&apos;ll just send her a copy of a couple of the<br/>&gt;Ben Johnston  quartets to get a reaction...<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;                      She&apos;ll probably just say they sound &quot;out of tune...&quot;<br/>&gt;</p><p>&#x9;Well, to be honest, if you&apos;re talking about the old CRI recordings<br/>of those pieces, they *do* sound &quot;out of tune&quot; for the most part.  Now, it<br/>could be that my ears aren&apos;t &quot;attuned&quot; enough to JI to know the<br/>difference,  but I think that JI has a &quot;sound&quot;---a kind of &quot;buzz&quot; or<br/>&quot;purr&quot;  to it (not &quot;buzz&quot; in the sense that Kyle Gann means with 12-tet (I<br/>find it  odd that he uses that word actually---what I find lame about<br/>12tet is the  lack of anything in particular that you hear in it--it<br/>just sounds empty in comparison to JI, with it&apos;s hummy purring).   Any<br/>time I put on  computer-generated JI stuff I can definitely hear that JI<br/>sound.   When I&apos;m  listening to PArtch on chromelodeon (as opposed to the<br/>inharmonic metallic  and wood timbres) also.  And La Monte Young&apos;s and<br/>???? Harrison&apos;s pianos.  And this &quot;JI sound&quot; is something I heard and<br/>recognized immediately---the first time I put on the Well-Tuned Piano<br/>(which was, to my best recollection, the first JI piece I ever heard)---I<br/>didn&apos;t have to &quot;learn it.&quot;</p><p>&#x9;But I&apos;m afraid I rarely get this from the B Johnston quartets,<br/>(the recordings) at least, #2 and #6.     I&apos;m not knocking the<br/>pieces----that little MIDI exceprt that Joe Monzo has on his website of<br/>the 8th quartet  is truely AWESOME in what it&apos;s weirdness does to my<br/>brain.  yum yum.  And I can hear the &quot;purr&quot; in every chord (doesn&apos;t it go<br/>up to the 37th limit or such?)</p><p>&#x9;Incidentally, Paul ERlich mentioned &quot;seasickness.&quot; I think this is<br/>something positive, something to aim for in microtonality in general.  The<br/>feeling that your whole sense of pitch-world is being warped.  I get that<br/>from Ben Johnston&apos;s 8th, in MIDI, and Paul Erlich&apos;s TIBIA, and many<br/>others.  That&apos;s a sensation to treasure in my opinion.</p><p>&#x9;On the other hand, there&apos;s sounding &quot;out of tune.&quot;  That means<br/>that the music sounds plain old wrong.  Someting about the tuning you&apos;re<br/>hearing ---the player&apos;s intonation of it, or the tuning itself---isn&apos;t<br/>strong enough to twist your stomach.   So you just think it sounds &quot;out of<br/>tune.&quot;</p><p>&#x9;Of course there are always details and subtleties that more<br/>experienced folks will catch and others won&apos;t. But there has to be<br/>something immediate.  When I put on Well-Tuned-Piano, I don&apos;t need to<br/>listen to more than a few seconds to hear that the tuning GELS, coheres.</p><p>&#x9;Sadly, I don&apos;t get this from the 2nd and 6th Quartet recordings of<br/>Johnston.  Something is wrong.  If it&apos;s my &quot;lack of experience&quot; as a<br/>listener, than the music is no better than the old modernist stuff that<br/>insists on experience before one can &quot;appreciate the rows&quot; or whatever.<br/>But I dont&apos; think that&apos;s the problem.  I think it&apos;s the performances.</p><p>&#x9;I should add that I have the Johnston &quot;piano album&quot;, and it all<br/>works like gangbusters----it doesn&apos;t sound &quot;out of tune&quot; at all.</p><p>C Bailey</p></div><h3><a id=40946 href="#40946">ðŸ”—</a>wallyesterpaulrus &#x3C;wallyesterpaulrus@yahoo.com&#x3E;</h3><span>11/16/2002 11:27:27 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In tuning@y..., Christopher Bailey &lt;cb202@c...&gt; wrote:</p><p>&gt; could be that my ears aren&apos;t &quot;attuned&quot; enough to JI to know the<br/>&gt; difference,  but I think that JI has a &quot;sound&quot;---a kind of &quot;buzz&quot; or<br/>&gt; &quot;purr&quot;  to it (not &quot;buzz&quot; in the sense that Kyle Gann means with<br/>12-tet (I<br/>&gt; find it  odd that he uses that word actually---what I find lame<br/>about<br/>&gt; 12tet is the  lack of anything in particular that you hear in it--it<br/>&gt; just sounds empty in comparison to JI, with it&apos;s hummy<br/>purring).</p><p>i find that curious. i certainly know the ji &quot;buzz&quot; that you&apos;re talking<br/>about -- the sychrony of all the combinational tones, etc. -- but<br/>when moving away from ji, this &quot;buzz&quot; turns into at least as<br/>noticeable a &quot;noise&quot;, and of course you get the beating too. so to<br/>my ears, it&apos;s *definitely* the just intervals that sound &quot;empty&quot; in<br/>comparison with their tempered counterparts. &quot;empty&quot; is of<br/>course a very useful quality to have at your disposal, artistically<br/>speaking . . .</p><p>i don&apos;t remember the details of the ben johnston string quartet<br/>recordings that joseph, myself, and several other list members<br/>were fortunate enough to obtain copies of through this list. i think<br/>some of the details were posted here. but there are many, many<br/>moments on the middle few quartets, and almost the entirety of<br/>quartet #6, where the ji &quot;buzz&quot; is well in evidence.</p><p>&gt; &#x9;But I&apos;m afraid I rarely get this from the B Johnston quartets,<br/>&gt; (the recordings) at least, #2 and #6.</p><p>i suspect we may be listening to different recordings of #6, then.<br/>#2, i believe, is in a much more atonal, serialist-oriented style,<br/>so there is a lot less &quot;justness&quot; in evidence . . .</p></div><h3><a id=40953 href="#40953">ðŸ”—</a>Alison Monteith &#x3C;alison.monteith3@which.net&#x3E;</h3><span>11/17/2002 7:04:21 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Christopher Bailey wrote:</p><p>Incidentally, Paul ERlich mentioned &quot;seasickness.&quot; I think this is something positive, something<br/>to aim for in microtonality in general.

Quite frankly, I wasn&apos;t even aware<br/>that these pieces are out on CRI.  I wonder if they&apos;re still<br/>available? (most of CRI&apos;s stuff stays in production I believe).  No,<br/>I got a recording of all the quartets from Johnston himself, and I&apos;m<br/>not having such problems.  I wonder if these are different<br/>performances...</p><p>The question about performance is somewhat complicated by the fact<br/>that Johnston doesn&apos;t mention who the performers are on the CD...</p><p>(Haven&apos;t *I* also done the same thing as a composer??  Not a good<br/>practice, though...)</p><p>Certainly, I agree about the peculiar JI &quot;purr...&quot;</p><p>&gt; &#x9;Incidentally, Paul ERlich mentioned &quot;seasickness.&quot; I think<br/>this is something positive, something to aim for in microtonality in<br/>general.

That&apos;s a sensation to treasure in<br/>my opinion.<br/>&gt;</p><p>****Thanks, Chris, for mentioning this, and it&apos;s also one of the<br/>reasons *I&apos;m* interested in microtonality.  I like the change<br/>into &quot;new sound worlds&quot;... without getting too emblematic...</p><p>I guess I shouldn&apos;t fault the NY Philharmonic violinist so much.  The<br/>more I thought about it, I&apos;m beginning to realize that probably in<br/>order to get a job with the Philharmonic, a person has to be a<br/>neurotic about traditional Western pitch practices, as well as with<br/>the traditional *dramatic* nature of Western music.  I think that<br/>organ, per se, is emblematic of these practices.</p><p>Therefore, it&apos;s not surprising that some, if not all, of the<br/>musicians would be like this.  It&apos;s not just the microtonality, by<br/>the way, that concerns me, but the insistence on the kind<br/>of &quot;knock &apos;em out, slam bam&quot; dramatic style of particularly Western<br/>composition that it implies.  Believe me, I could certainly write<br/>such a work, and probably one that would please this person.<br/>However, it would be almost a *parody*... certainly not what I&apos;m<br/>interested in doing now and, from my present point of view, more like<br/>a &quot;student&quot; work.  I&apos;m not very interested in this, of course...</p><p>J.
