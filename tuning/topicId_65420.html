But I&apos;ll add that lots of pop a cappella does<br/>not use many 7th chords.  They have lots of fifths and even suspended 9ths<br/>and 4ths and such.  But the striving is clearly for beatless harmonies a la<br/>JI.  I&apos;ll add that in relation to my recent project, I just am seemingly going<br/>to get the opportunity to get 95% isolated separate voice tracks for our<br/>recent championship quartet &quot;Realtime,&quot; which I&apos;ll be able to analyze and<br/>work with.  I&apos;ll certainly share the results, and I&apos;m very excited about this.<br/>They are a quartet beyond even many other recent champions as far as<br/>blend and not oversinging.

Of course,<br/>as you all know, the dominant seventh chord is very important in<br/>western music. It&apos;s interesting that the tempered major third<br/>is 14 cents sharp, and the minor seventh 32 cents sharp, so 7/5<br/>is only off by 18 cents. 10/7 is off by exactly the same amount,<br/>therefore, tritones do the Escher-shift thing, sometimes sounding<br/>like F#/C and sometimes Gb/C but I am certainly preaching to the<br/>choir here!<br/>&gt;</p></div><h3><a id=65449 href="#65449">ðŸ”—</a>Carl Lumma &#x3C;clumma@yahoo.com&#x3E;</h3><span>3/15/2006 1:20:08 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>&gt; &gt; &gt; I just am seemingly going to get the opportunity to get 95%<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; isolated separate voice tracks for our recent championship<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; quartet &quot;Realtime,&quot; which I&apos;ll be able to analyze and work<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; with.
