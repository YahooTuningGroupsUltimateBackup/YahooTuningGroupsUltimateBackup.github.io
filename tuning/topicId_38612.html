Johnny</p><p>&gt; I&apos;m sorry about the unavoidable association with the worst excesses of<br/>&gt; &gt; Religious Fundamentalism, but the term &quot;fundamentalism&quot; has a meaning<br/>&gt; &gt; independent of what the beliefs are about.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; They may not post, but they certainly make claims on their websites.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; etc.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Well said, Dave ! There are many more examples to support this.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Off-hand I offer the following<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Johnny Reinhard: &apos;For true composition, I implore people on this<br/>&gt; list, please, don&apos;t compromise. If you really want to use Just<br/>&gt; for its qualitative properties...timelessness, ringing, partials<br/>&gt; and harmonics, basis of brass sound, basis the timbre of the<br/>&gt; human voice, of strings. The true home: Om.&apos;<br/>&gt;</p><p>Joel, I am completely irreligious.  I use &quot;Om&quot; as the reverse hum that most<br/>easily generates the harmonics of the voice.  I&apos;m talking about Hoomi singing<br/>or overtone singing.  Before that I was merely descriptive.  The true home in<br/>the sense of the Picardy third outlining of the major chord of the overtone<br/>series that was favored as the finalis in earlier days.  It is also the<br/>tonic/fundamental of the generating of harmonics.  There is no voodoo<br/>religion or JI fundamentalism here at all.</p><p>&gt; Johnny at &lt;<a href="http://www.newmusicbox.org/hymn/sep00/reinhard.html">http://www.newmusicbox.org/hymn/sep00/reinhard.html</a>&gt; :<br/>&gt; &apos;Just Intonation is arguably definitive consonance, or the key<br/>&gt; to the relationship between numbers and pitch, or the natural<br/>&gt; universal that jump starts the diversity of music around the<br/>&gt; world. And yet its melodies lose their angularity in the<br/>&gt; harmonic blend that produced them.&apos;<br/>&gt;</p><p>Joel, I believe you have completely misunderstood me here.  Please notice I<br/>said &quot;arguably,&quot; followed by an &quot;or&quot; and another &quot;or.&quot;  If you are interested<br/>I can pass on a copy of my Phenomenology and Its Application to Microtonality<br/>paper.  This is where I define my terms regarding &quot;essential&quot; intervals as<br/>they regard just intonation.  The above in context is about using stranger<br/>notes, quite like Julia in this particular instance.</p><p>&gt; Johnny may keep saying &apos;polymicrotonality&apos;, but you&apos;d be<br/>&gt; surprised at how many times he mentions JI, see<br/>&gt; &lt;<a href="http://stereosociety.com/body_jrpolymi.html">http://stereosociety.com/body_jrpolymi.html</a>&gt;, an article which<br/>&gt; purportedly is about &apos;polymicrotonality&apos;.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;</p><p>Why is it so difficult to imagine that someone that is deeply in just<br/>intonation is also deeply into all other intervalic relationships?  Why is it<br/>that JI people think that I don&apos;t truly yet feet the all-encompassing way of<br/>the pure just aficionado?  Why is that the multi-tempered out there think<br/>true JI feelings are threatening?  It&apos;s like my getting kicked out of the<br/>ethnomusicology department because I knew too much Western music.  What&apos;s a<br/>left brain without a right brain?</p><p>&gt;<br/>&gt; The following is a serious question, which I seriously hope<br/>&gt; someone has an answer to:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; When and where was the term that has come to be called &apos;Just<br/>&gt; Intonation&apos; coined, what was the original term, and in what<br/>&gt; language was it in ?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;</p><p>I believe it was tracked to Thomas Morely in Renaissance England contained in<br/>his monograph on good singing.</p><p>Hope you&apos;re feeling better.</p><p>Sincerely, Johnny Reinhard</p></div>
