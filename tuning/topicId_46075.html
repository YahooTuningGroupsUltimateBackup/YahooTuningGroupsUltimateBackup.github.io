Quasi, because I<br/>didn&apos;t use flattened octaves.  However, I did use an<br/>electronic tuner, and enforced 1200-cent unstretched<br/>octaves.  So they are flatter than they&apos;d usually be on<br/>a piano.  Observations:</p><p>() It sounds a lot better than it did.</p><p>() This piano is a piece of &amp;*#*@).</p><p>() I still had to touch it up at the end.  Really, a<br/>bearing plan is the only way to tune.  Every string is<br/>different.  Perhaps one of the more expensive digital<br/>tuners (such as <a href="http://www.verituneinc.com">www.verituneinc.com</a>) can really do the<br/>job.  I haven&apos;t tried one.</p><p>() It would be better to apply a real stretch formula<br/>to Alaska 5 rather than just attempting pure octaves<br/>everywhere.  Hmmm... how to keep the tuning procedure<br/>from getting unwieldy when you can&apos;t rely on beatless<br/>octaves. . .</p><p>() I used a Peterson V-SAM.  Not recommended.  I&apos;m<br/>returning it.  While they got a lot right, this tuner<br/>has the following limitations:</p><p>&#x9;() No volume control for the audio output!<br/>&#x9;It&apos;s unusably loud.</p><p>&#x9;() Only 2 user-programmable tunings!</p><p>&#x9;() Not really readable over the claimed range, at<br/>&#x9;least on piece-of-*$*($# pianos.&#x9;</p><p>&#x9;() Does not support stretched/contracted octaves.</p><p>&#x9;() The plastic used on the blue rubber boot has a<br/>&#x9;noticeably foul smell.</p><p>-Carl</p></div>
