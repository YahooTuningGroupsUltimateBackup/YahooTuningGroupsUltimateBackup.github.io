What happens after that is up<br/>to Yahoo.</p><p>&gt;    It cannot be otherwise -- for Schoenberg&apos;s<br/>&gt; vision of music is fundamentally repressive, it<br/>&gt; is based on the rigid and brutal avoidance of<br/>&gt; basic human behaviors...tonality, functional<br/>&gt; harmony, diatonic melodies.</p><p>Wrong again.  Schoenberg&apos;s vision of music (specifically,<br/>his vision of it from around 1905-1913, which is the<br/>period I&apos;m interested in and I write about) is based<br/>on the desire to eliminate restrictions that had been<br/>&quot;enforced&quot; by standard music-theory, and to liberate<br/>composers&apos;s musical imagination from such restrictions.</p><p>&gt;    Like the repressive Soviet state that could<br/>&gt; only maintain its rigid rules by crushing its<br/>&gt; citizens and oppressing them, Schoenberg&apos;s ideas<br/>&gt; can only be maintained and popularized in music<br/>&gt; by using totalitarian methods.<br/>&gt;    And that&apos;s exactly what was done in American<br/>&gt; university music departments after WW II.<br/>&gt; Schoenberg&apos;s ideas were forced upon students<br/>&gt; and other faculty using totalitarian methods --<br/>&gt; censorship of opposing points of view, the<br/>&gt; crushing of freedom of speech, and purges<br/>&gt; designed to eliminate non-Schonbergian ideas<br/>&gt; from the university music departments.</p><p>The use other people made of Schoenberg&apos;s ideas,<br/>and the style they used to teach them, cannot be<br/>blamed on Schoenberg.</p><p>&gt;     Thus we would expect Joe Mozno to attempt to<br/>&gt; use the totalitarian methods of censorship to<br/>&gt; crush me, to silence me, to blot out my words<br/>&gt; before anyone can read them, since Joe Monzo is<br/>&gt; the most devout Schoenberg cultist on this tuning<br/>&gt; list.<br/>&gt;     Study carefully Joe Monzo&apos;s abject pleas to<br/>&gt; censor my words, ladies and gentlemen.

Why<br/>&gt; does Joe Monzo shrink in terror from the open<br/>&gt; debate of a free society?</p><p>Wrong again.</p><p>Joe Monzo is fearless and does not &quot;shrink in terror&quot;<br/>from anything at all, least of all from &quot;the open debate<br/>of a free society&quot;.</p><p>&gt;     Could it be because Joe Monzo has been<br/>&gt; infected with the totalitarian ideology<br/>&gt; Schoenberg preached?<br/>&gt;     Could it be that Joe Monzo has been so<br/>&gt; thoroughly indoctrinated in Schoenberg systems<br/>&gt; of thought that his only reponse to criticism of<br/>&gt; his musical commissar is the knee-jerk cry for<br/>&gt; censorship characteristic of all toadies who<br/>&gt; have sacrificed their consciences on the altar<br/>&gt; of a totalitarian ideology?</p><p>Could it be that Joe Monzo is really tired of reading<br/>posts by Brian McLaren in which he hopes that his eyes<br/>catch genuine useful scientific or musical information<br/>as the vast bulk of the post -- filled with errors, insults,<br/>name-calling, pointless off-topic references to Nazis and<br/>Soviet ideology, and very little relevance to the post by<br/>Monzo to which this is supposed to be a response --<br/>zooms past as he searches for the good stuff?</p><p>Yes, it could be this, and it is this.</p><p>There&apos;s nothing wrong with using strong language in a<br/>debate, but gratuitous harrassment of a list subscriber<br/>is a clear violation of the policy that all of us have<br/>agreed to in order to carry on discussion here.<br/>The evidence of his posts shows that Brian McLaren is<br/>*repeatedly* guilty of this behavior.</p><p>-monz<br/><a href="http://www.monz.org">http://www.monz.org</a><br/>&quot;All roads lead to n^0&quot;</p><p>_________________________________________________________<br/>Do You Yahoo!?<br/>Get your free @... address at <a href="http://mail.yahoo.com">http://mail.yahoo.com</a></p></div><h3><a id=689 href="#689">ðŸ”—</a>jpehrson@...</h3><span>7/23/2001 1:55:57 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In crazy_music@y..., xed@e... wrote:</p><p><a href="/crazy_music/topicId_unknown.html#666">/crazy_music/topicId_unknown.html#666</a><br/>&gt;    And that&apos;s exactly what was done in American<br/>&gt; university music departments after WW II.<br/>&gt; Schoenberg&apos;s ideas were forced upon students<br/>&gt; and other faculty using totalitarian methods --<br/>&gt; censorship of opposing points of view, the<br/>&gt; crushing of freedom of speech, and purges<br/>&gt; designed to eliminate non-Schonbergian ideas<br/>&gt; from the university music departments.</p><p>As someone who was in the university systems at that time (late 60&apos;s)<br/>I can vouch that this part is absolutely true....
