Unless you&apos;ve changed it since then.</p><p>Now, anyone can take take this scale for themselves and play it (remember that 833.09030 is the &quot;octave&quot; here), and they will discover that two steps down from 1/1 the tone forms an interval of 466.x cents (1.309...) with 1/1.</p><p>So this statement:</p><p>&gt;there is no creation of 1.309 &gt;as a tone in the mode of this scale &gt;based from the root tone.</p><p>is simply, demonstratably, incorrect.</p><p>Also, all that stuff about avoiding critical band conflicts and intervals smaller than so and so simply goes out the window as soon as you extend the scale beyond one &quot;phiave&quot;.

The only statement made about this, if I recall correctly, was to the completely opposite effect, when I pointed out that you had simply taken a few sections then stopped and called it a scale.</p><p>&gt;    I simply consider it a way of taking consecutive PHI-ths between &gt;2/1 and 1/1 in (and only in) the<br/>&gt;  direction toward 1/1, but several people said I should be calling &gt;this splitting method (which I admittedly borrowed directly from &gt;architecture) &quot;taking golden sections&quot;.</p><p>One person called it taking successive golden sections.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;    How should I phrase this (or not?) without pissing people &gt;off?  &gt;I&apos;ve heard so many different  (often conflicting) suggestions &gt;on what the proper terminology is for this it&apos;s not even funny.</p><p>There is no set &quot;proper terminology&quot;, you could call it &quot;Walloon ensquadultion&quot; if you wanted to. The only real requirement for being &quot;proper&quot; is that others understand what you are talking about.</p><p>&gt;<br/>&gt; 2)   What other scales beside A, B, and the silver-section scale &gt;(using 2.414 as the generator...)   what other scales can you think &gt;of using a (1/number)^x+1 type generation system and/or what papers &gt;do you know of related to research of such a construction?</p><p>Sorry but this statement reveals that either you simply do not know what you are talking about, or seriously misrepresent what you&apos;re thinking when you write it down.</p><p>Start with the Means of ancient Greece, and go from there.</p><p>&gt; Hopefully I can finally reach some sort of consensus about all of &gt;this (without pissing people off)...<br/>&gt;</p><p>Noone is pissed off about anything.
