I also<br/>feel that the 1-3#5 serves as a good (i.e., positive) example of the<br/>potential possibilities that can rise outside the compass of just<br/>intonational organizing, thinking, and referencing. Of course this is not<br/>to say that there&apos;s anything &apos;wrong&apos; with JI organizing, thinking, and<br/>referencing...** Only that I believe there are indeed other fundamentally<br/>valid (structural) possibilities to at least be considered (and hopefully<br/>mined).</p><p>Dan</p><p>*This [&apos;creatures of temperament...&apos;] is also mentioned (in the context of<br/>the augmented triad) by Ellis in Helmholtz&apos; &quot;On the Sensation of Tone.&quot;<br/>&quot;From what follows it is evident that the transformation could only take<br/>place in tempered intonation. The tones confounded are all 42 cents apart,<br/>and could not possibly have been confounded in just intonation.&quot; [Alexander<br/>J. Ellis, footnote pg. 339, _On the Sensation of Tone_]</p><p>**I&apos;ve posted about recasting the augmented chord in interval ratios of 19<br/>a couple of times... TD 74: &quot;One of my very favorite 12-tET [single octave]<br/>chords is the 1-3-#5-7 (@3+3+b3), which to my ear[s] &apos;needs&apos; a &gt;15/8 (or<br/>13/7) major seventh to retain its (personally desirable) 12-tET<br/>character... So I personally prefer a +19/15 + 5/4 for the augmented triad<br/>with a +6/5 on top (+19/15 + 5/4 + 6/5 @ 1/1, 19/15, 19/12, 19/10).&quot; And TD<br/>75 pertaining to a 1-3-#5-7 + 1-3-5-7 set @ 240 : 304 : 380 : 456 : 570 :<br/>684 : 855 : 912, where +19/15, +5/4, +6/5, +5/4, +6/5, +5/4, +16/15 = 1:1,<br/>19:15, 19:12, 19:10, 19:8, 19:6&amp;2/3rds (57/20), 19:5&amp;1/3rd (57/16), 19:5.</p></div>
