Clearly either of these formulae will<br/>rate 3:5 as more consonant than 5:6 and 4:5 as more consonant than 5:8<br/>etc.</p><p>Sometimes we adopt octave-equivalence as a simplifying measure, but<br/>everyone knows (I hope) that this is only an approximation and not<br/>real. The above of course refers to sensory consonance, not stylistic<br/>consonance.</p><p>Kraig, I am very interested in what formulae you have found useful for<br/>predicting the consonance of chords.
