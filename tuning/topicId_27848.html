I tuned it up when you guys first<br/>published it like I do most scales that get published<br/>around here. Played with it a bit.</p><p>It was interesting in a way but didn&apos;t really catch<br/>fire with me at the time. I understand BlackJacky#1 was<br/>very microtonal but I didn&apos;t have a chance to grab it<br/>before it went down.</p><p>Let me change my question. Mathematical analysis aside<br/>(as it is meaningless - that is partly why I wrote that<br/>very common-practice sounding piece in 13tET months<br/>back that got everyone in an uproar), does Jacky<br/>consider that piece microtonal and do other people hear<br/>it as microtonal?</p><p>If there is a consensus that that is what microtonality<br/>sounds like then I will step back and admit I have been<br/>confused and stop using that label regarding my own<br/>work.</p><p>Which I probably should anyway. Xenharmonic (or maybe<br/>xentonal since I try to work more on the contrapuntal<br/>side of things rather than the harmonic one in my own<br/>opinion) is a better word anyway -- more descriptive,<br/>more meaningful, less ambiguous. If microtonal means<br/>anything you want it to then it really doesn&apos;t mean<br/>anything at all and should be withdrawn from usage.</p><p>- Jeff</p></div><h3><a id=27858 href="#27858">ðŸ”—</a>jpehrson@rcn.com</h3><span>9/3/2001 7:08:49 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In tuning@y..., &quot;X.
