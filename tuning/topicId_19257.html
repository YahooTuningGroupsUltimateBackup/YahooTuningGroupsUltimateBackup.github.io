For years, I<br/>have gotten off-list postings asking for guidance about one topic or another,<br/>and this list reflects that experience. I do find that the list often bogs down<br/>with having to start from scratch, so this seems like a reasonable approach.  I<br/>have deliberately not pushed topics favored by individuals, including my own<br/>favorites (you won&apos;t find a word about Gamelan Selonding, for example), I have<br/>included topics that interest me not at all (Blues, Haba) and have sought out<br/>the most encompassing terminology, thus &quot;mixing alternative tunings&quot; rather than<br/>&quot;polymicrotonality&quot;.  Neither have I included articles on particular performers,<br/>organizations, or composers, only a list of theorists, some of whom are also<br/>composers.

It is not the usual in every geographical area in every<br/>time period.&quot;</p><p>Please read my draft. I believe I used the past tense properly, and that my<br/>characterization of quarter-comma MT as standard is true. Further, to quote<br/>Barber: &quot;Strictly, there is only one meantone temperament.&quot; And by that he means<br/>quarter-comma MT, where the wholetones are indeed, means.</p><p>&quot;The first meantone was not exactly 1/4 comma (Pietro Aaron).&quot;</p><p>Aron&apos;s tuning description can be reasonable read as an eleven tone quarter-comma<br/>MT, albeit with limited precision other than (a paraphrase): make C-E &quot;sonorous<br/>and just&quot;, make the fifth C-G &quot;a little flat&quot;, flatter G-D similarly, and tune A<br/>so that D-A and A-E are equal. Then tune the fifths Eb-Bb-F-C exactly the same<br/>as the previous fifths. Then tune F# and C# as pure thirds to D and A.  I<br/>realise that this limited precision is problematic, but not enough so to keep<br/>this from being an adequate, non-numerical decription of the MT principle.</p><p>&quot;Could we explain the roots of the word &quot;meantone&quot; as in identical whole tones<br/>in a finite number of keys with only 12 keys per octave at the top of the<br/>answer, explaining all the while the tie in with the word &quot;temperament&quot;?&quot;</p><p>No, the top of my article is suffiently clear.

Music is<br/>traditionally the ultimate ineffable experience, though this contrasts with<br/>some of the more glib on this list.&quot;</p><p>Come on. When you want to be glib (e.g. on Schoenberg&apos;s row forms and his brush<br/>strokes), you are.  You have derived tunings of your own on numerical grounds<br/>(i.e. the presence of a given prime number in the ratio).

Less is more, IMHO. &quot;</p><p>Ligeti (certainly not my favorite composer, even less my favorite person) and<br/>Leedy are included on the grounds that they have published works explicitly in<br/>quarter-comma MT, taking advantages of features unique to MT (for the record,<br/>Ligeti&apos;s _Passacaglia Ungharese_ features the pure thirds, while the pieces in<br/>Leedy&apos;s _Harpsichord Book_ use a variety of atributes among them the black-key<br/>slendro approximation in &quot;Lou Harrison&apos;s Round&quot;).  To my knowledge, Leedy has<br/>also published the only article (in PNM) specifically on the use of MT in<br/>contemporary music. I have composed an entire opera in fifth-comma, and have<br/>deliberately not included it; I have never heard the Carlos, so have not<br/>included that.</p><p>The question of whether 31-tone is modern quarter-comma MT, or even, as Fokker<br/>had it, a form of JI is definitely a debate, into the potential fisticuffs<br/>thereof I shall not gladly walk.*</p><p>&quot;Perhaps we could have a primary writer, keeping it short, and then single<br/>sentence add ons by others who sign their name to their even shorter<br/>contributions.&quot;</p><p>No objection.</p><p>There.

I mean them as abstract reactions to<br/>what I have seen.  Thank you for indicating again &quot;And need I repeat that my<br/>list was only that, a list off the top of my head, with an open invitation to<br/>revision, addition, or comment?&quot;  That&apos;s all I was doing.  I never mentioned<br/>your name.</p><p>I would invite the inclusion of Gamelan Selonding, for example.  Yet you are<br/>not responding in such a way to invite &quot;comment&quot; let alone addition, or<br/>revision (&quot;No, the top of my article is sufficiently clear&quot;).  You wrote a<br/>single essay, and others are encouraged to write them as well.  Is there no<br/>opportunity to discuss methodology?  I hope not.</p><p>It was of great interest to read why you chose certain things.  Your reason<br/>to leave out your own meantone-tuned opera was similar to that of Walther<br/>(who was certainly deserving of being included in his Lexikon, but chose not<br/>to mention himself in his monumental work.</p><p>Perhaps we need to depersonalize the dabates.  Daniel, you didn&apos;t need to<br/>clarify that Ligeti was &quot;not my favorite composer, even less my favorite<br/>person.&quot;  And with all reported glibness, you needn&apos;t invent &quot;a Reinhard<br/>exception: We go with facts or consensus except when Johnny Reinhard<br/>disagrees.&quot;  My experiences can be valuable to this discussion even though<br/>I&apos;m like Cheney from Wyoming with 1 vote. (You saw how that changed with the<br/>Bush election. :)</p><p>My objections need to be examined as does that of everyone who posts on this<br/>list.  Intimidation works many ways, overt and subtle and invisible, and it<br/>needs to be weeded out, but not by being silenced.  My concern remains that<br/>we could create problems we as yet do not foresee with a FAQ growing on<br/>automatic.  Thank you Daniel Wolf for your good natured engagement.  Please<br/>try to believe that I mean what I am saying.</p><p>Best, Johnny Reinhard</p><p>To JdL: I will try to give examples as time permits.

(or, WHAT IS MICROTONAL MUSIC?)</p><p>I know, I know... but it&apos;s as frequently asked a question as I know<br/>of, and as long as it covers the two basic camps in an easily<br/>understandable, to-the-point way, then I couldn&apos;t see it being any<br/>sort of a real big problem! This could also be a way to frame &apos;there&apos;s<br/>more than quartertones&apos; or whatever needs to be said in that regard.</p><p>2) HOW DID TWELVE-TONE EQUAL TEMPERMENT ACHIEVE ITS PREDOMINANT<br/>STATUS -- OR DID IT?</p><p>This, or something like it, could be used to both chronicle the<br/>history (and yes, address questions like &apos;what tuning did Bach use&apos;,<br/>etc.), as well as shed light on 12-tET in a wider, more global<br/>perspective...</p><p>3) WHAT&apos;S WITH ALL THE MATH?</p><p>This could be a way to quickly go over some of the basics and briefly<br/>shed some light on the Pythagorean/Helmholtz type duality that so<br/>often seems to shadow tuning related issues... especially the<br/>theoretical end.</p><p>4) WHERE CAN I HEAR MICROTONAL MUSIC?</p><p>Some simple (i.e., jazz, classical, world, and whatever else needs to<br/>be listed without hopelessly dissipating a positive impact)<br/>categorized internet links and discography lists would probably be the<br/>best way to handle this type of a question... ? It&apos;s one I hear a lot.</p><p>Again, I think the FAQ idea is a good one. And Paul Erlich, Daniel<br/>Wolf and Margo Schulter all strike me as good candidates to draft or<br/>organize and edit something that&apos;s technically sound as well as easily<br/>understandable... so hopefully everybody can agree on something in the<br/>end, even if it takes a while.</p><p>--Dan Stearns</p></div><h3><a id=19283 href="#19283">ðŸ”—</a>PERLICH@ACADIAN-ASSET.COM</h3><span>2/22/2001 3:00:37 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>As you all know, I&apos;m no longer receiving e-mail from this list. But<br/>I&apos;m checking the Web to check up on the development of the FAQ -- so<br/>keep FAQ in the subject line of all relevant messages.</p><p>Johnny wrote,</p><p>&gt; FAQ is supposed to mean Frequently Asked Questions.  I do  not see<br/>the list<br/>&gt; of topics in any way reflecting this.</p><p>&gt; No one would ask questions on these topics, nor would they read<br/>through<br/>&gt; lengthy and &quot;opinionated&quot; or &quot;biased&quot; or &quot;ideological&quot; positions.<br/>Any hint<br/>&gt; of impropriety will throw sludge on the topic.  If we are<br/>attempting an<br/>&gt; exhaustive encyclopedia, we will fail.  Perhaps as short an answer<br/>without<br/>&gt; giving an incomplete meaning.  All attempts at pushing a view have<br/>to be<br/>&gt; curtailed.</p><p>These comments flabbergasted me. I don&apos;t see where any of it came<br/>from, I&apos;ve seen myriad questioners on this list asking for<br/>clarification on these very topics, and disagree with the suggestion<br/>that anyone&apos;s trying to push their agenda through this FAQ. Notice<br/>how helpful many people found the very first attempt at a FAQ entry<br/>by Daniel Wolf -- clearly this was an area in need of clarification<br/>for many! Anyway, no harm in trying to anticipate new questions that<br/>might be asked in the future.</p><p>Another FAQ topic I&apos;ll suggest, given how often the newbie questions<br/>come up:</p><p>SUBHARMONICS</p><p>&gt; In this difficult subject involvement, we ought not hurry.  In<br/>&gt; fact, we should not finalize any faster than needed to hold the<br/>line on<br/>&gt; misunderstanding due to any FAQ produced.</p><p>&gt;<br/>&gt; About the meantone response, is it necessary to say that quarter-<br/>comma<br/>&gt; meantone is the usual?  It is not the usual in every geographical<br/>area in<br/>&gt; every time period.</p><p>Who said it was?</p><p>&gt; The first meantone was not exactly 1/4 comma (Pietro<br/>&gt; Aaron).</p><p>Do you know _exactly_ what Aron&apos;s tuning was?</p><p>&gt; Could we explain the roots of the word &quot;meantone&quot; as in identical<br/>whole tones</p><p>Makes sense, as long as you&apos;re sure to clarify that you mean &quot;major<br/>seconds&quot; and explain why they&apos;re different from, say, diminished<br/>thirds.</p><p>&gt; in a finite number of keys with only 12 keys per octave at the top<br/>of the<br/>&gt; answer, explaining all the while the tie in with the<br/>word &quot;temperament&quot;?</p><p>There is absolutely no reason to invoke 12 keys per octave. And I<br/>think if you leave &quot;whole tones&quot; in there, it can be confusing, since<br/>Norbert Newbie might walk over to his Korg, dial up a meantone<br/>tuning, and notice that the whole tone from F# to G# is smaller than<br/>the whole tone from G# to Bb.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; It is a great opportunity for any of us to spend our valuable time<br/>on joint<br/>&gt; purpose.  Sometimes it is just not possible.  Some of us are<br/>naturally<br/>&gt; extroverted and it is easier to fill bandwidth with words.</p><p>I see nothing but positive, collaborative effort so far. Why the<br/>negativity?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I don&apos;t think the FAQ is the place to plug anything.</p><p>I don&apos;t think you&apos;ll get any argument there!</p><p>&gt; Preferences are always<br/>&gt; made to dead people.  Living people are a delicate commodity.  If<br/>you mention<br/>&gt; only Ligeti and Leedy is clearly the result of stylistic<br/>preferences, as well<br/>&gt; as based on physical familiarity with the music.  What about Wendy<br/>Carlos<br/>&gt; using 1/5th comma meantone? What about how 31-tone music is modern<br/>1/4 comma<br/>&gt; meantone...or is this a debate?  Less is more, IMHO.</p><p>Johnny, clearly you will have a great deal to contribute to this FAQ.<br/>Naturally, all your suggestions will be considered by everyone, and,<br/>unless there are sound objections, will be included in the final<br/>result. Why not just make your contributions, and leave out the venom?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Perhaps we could have a primary writer, keeping it short, and then<br/>single<br/>&gt; sentence add ons by others who sign their name to their even<br/>shorter<br/>&gt; contributions.</p><p>I see nothing wrong with the collaborative process as it is evolving<br/>now -- each topic has a primary writer, and we all make our<br/>contributions and criticisms and throw them around a bit, until the<br/>writer comes up with something satisfactory to everyone. There could<br/>be dozens of contributors for a given topic, but no need to weigh<br/>down the FAQ with our names.</p></div><h3><a id=19286 href="#19286">ðŸ”—</a>Dave Keenan &#x3C;D.KEENAN@UQ.NET.AU&#x3E;</h3><span>2/22/2001 3:14:53 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In tuning@y..., &quot;Daniel Wolf&quot; &lt;djwolf1@m...&gt; wrote:<br/>Dave Keenan -- CONSONANCE-DISSONANCE MEASURES, and a bit more<br/>broadly-drawn JUST INTONATION</p><p>I&apos;m sorry.

and fill in the fields.</p><p>It&apos;s probably best if none of the text uses the character &apos;;&apos;.</p><p>If you need one, then do it as $z, and if you need to write<br/>$z in the description (don&apos;t imagine that anyone will), double<br/>up the dollar sign as $$z.</p><p>This is just for the titles, folder names and urls in the tree, so I think<br/>perhaps it isn&apos;t too restrictive to have to use $z if one does ever<br/>need a semicolon.</p><p>I&apos;ll explain why that is in a minute.</p><p>Here is how it works with &quot;Import Records&quot;.</p><p>-------------Adding entries or folders------------</p><p>If you just want to add a new folder, with nothing in it yet, you give<br/>the parent folder, and the folder, all on one line:</p><p>main; Calculations<br/>Calculations; Cents to from ratios</p><p>You can use :,; or tab as the delimiter when entering data.</p><p>Now to add a new entry to a folder, you give them in this order.</p><p>Calculations; Cents to from ratios; Cents to ratios and back again; Converting cents to<br/>ratios and back; <a href="http://homepage.ntlworld.com/robertwalker/tree/cents_to_from_ratios.htm;">homepage.ntlworld.com/robertwalker/tree/cents_to_from_ratios.htm;</a> Robert<br/>Walker</p><p>Again, they have to be all on one line.</p><p>i.e<br/>parent folder;folder;short title;title;url;author</p><p>The url can optionally leave out the http:// part.</p><p>There&apos;s an optional last field called &quot;anything else you want to add&quot;.</p><p>The database also accepts entries in quotes like this:<br/>&quot;Calculations&quot;;&quot;Cents to from ratios&quot;</p><p>(e.g. because you are exporting them from your own database program).</p><p>---------------Why its best not to use &quot;;&quot; in entries--------------------------</p><p>Here we need a work around for an eccentricity of the system,<br/>as the data is exported in comma delimited format as<br/>&quot;Calculations&quot;,&quot;Cents to from ratios&quot;</p><p>So far, fine, but if one of the entries has a comma in it, even within the<br/>quotes, it gets broken up when the table is re-entered.</p><p>Calculations; Cents, to from ratios<br/>will be exported as<br/>&quot;Calculations&quot;,&quot;Cents, to from ratios&quot;<br/>and re-imported as<br/>Calculations; Cents,; to from ratios</p><p>However, that&apos;s probably not a major problem.</p><p>If one wants to export the entire table, and then re-import it,<br/>thing to do when re-importing is to use tab or ; as the delimiter.</p><p>Clearly , is ruled out. : might also be needed in titles,<br/>but main reason for that is that if someone cuts and pastes<br/>a url into the url field, it may well include the http:// part</p><p>; is a less often used character, especially for titles.</p><p>Tabs would be fine, but maybe not everyone will want to use them.</p><p>Reason is that they mightn&apos;t be using a database program at all, or<br/>may have a simple one that only has comma delimited format,<br/>and one can&apos;t do a search and replace of &quot;,&quot; by &quot;\t&quot; in, say,<br/>Wordpad (where \t here means the tab character)</p><p>-----------------------re-arranging the whole tree----------------------</p><p>If anyone wants to re-arrange the whole tree, they can export it, delete<br/>the tree, then re-make it with the same column headings (the exported<br/>tree has the column headings in it.</p><p>Presumably we&apos;d have some discussion of that for major changes.</p><p>An example of when one might want to do that: perhaps one wants<br/>to change the name of one of the sub folders. To do that one<br/>would export the tree, do a search and replace of, say,<br/>&quot;Cents, to from ratios&quot; by some preferred title, then re-make the<br/>tree.</p><p>To make re-arranging the tree a bit easier, I&apos;d write a little<br/>program that reads the data, and makes a system of folders on your<br/>hard disk exactly matching the structure of the tree, with the lists<br/>of urls for each folder as a text file in each.</p><p>Then to re-arrange the tree, one would just move the folders around<br/>in Explorer.</p><p>Then I&apos;d do another little program that would read the directory<br/>structure and make it back into the url tree.</p><p>That&apos;s just for Windows, but anyone with a Mac / Linux could do the<br/>same thing easily - just find a friendly programamer to write a program<br/>to do it for you, if you aren&apos;t sure how to write one yourself.</p><p>I suggest that anyone who needs to re-arrange the whole tree creates<br/>a new dummy database called</p><p>&quot;FAQ tree is about to be re-arranged, please suspend adding urls for<br/>the moment&quot;<br/>in the database folder</p><p>Then and wait a little while before re-arranging it, in case someone<br/>is in the middle of adding data to it.</p><p>-----------------------------------------------------------------</p><p>Then I&apos;d also do another little program that would read the database<br/>and convert it into the text file for the tree control.</p><p>Since it is all database, then one could export it in any other format<br/>too, e.g. to make a web site from it with some preferred navigation<br/>system.</p><p>Eventually hopefully there will be a special web page for each folder<br/>in the tree which will introduce it, and organise its contents.<br/>- perhaps listed first in the tree control.</p><p>To mark an entry as the introductory one for the folder, prefix the url in<br/>the url field with []</p><p>I&apos;ve added a copy of the section of this message describing how to add<br/>new entries to the tree, under a new section &quot;info&quot;, which I suggest<br/>we use for anything to do with how the tree itself works.</p><p>Robert</p></div><h3><a id=19614 href="#19614">ðŸ”—</a>jpehrson@rcn.com</h3><span>3/1/2001 2:07:03 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In tuning@y..., &quot;Robert Walker&quot; &lt;robert_walker@r...&gt; wrote:</p><p><a href="/tuning/topicId_19257.html#19606">/tuning/topicId_19257.html#19606</a></p><p>&gt;<br/>&gt; See the database section:<br/>&gt; <a href="/tuning/database">/tuning/database</a><br/>&gt; I&apos;ve added a new database &quot;FAQ tree&quot;.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Anyone can add / delete entries or export the whole table, or import<br/>&gt; records, or delete the whole table (see later for the reason for<br/>that).<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; It&apos;s probably slightly faster to use the &quot;Import Records&quot;,<br/>especially if you have several records to add at once.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; However you can also just use &quot;Add Record&quot; and fill in the fields.<br/>&gt;</p><p>Hi Robert!</p><p>I&apos;m not quite sure how to get to your &quot;calculator&quot; URLS from this<br/>database.
