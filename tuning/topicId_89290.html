Today, for the first time ever, I was finally able to play my &quot;triharmonic&quot; scale which I first thought of back in 2006 and &quot;classified&quot; in 2008! (Indeed, it&apos;s been that long since.) At that time, I had no option to try it out. But today, someone was showing me some software synths at school. And together we found that one of them actually supported MTS. So I made some MIDI files with Scala and sent them to that synth. And it worked. The only problem was that there was a delay of more than 100 ms in the output so I had to be very careful when playing (or trying to play) faster passages on the MIDI keyboard. Finally, we picked up something like a filtered sawtooth sound (sorry for the loud overtones, I just wanted them to be clearly audible). We even didn&apos;t use any reverb or other &quot;spatial enhancing&quot; effects. FYI: These are absolute improvs, I made a few obvious mistakes while playing, but you know how it is ... I was just so-o-o-o happy that I could play those non-octave scales ...
