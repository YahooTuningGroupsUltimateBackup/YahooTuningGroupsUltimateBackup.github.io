Along the<br/>way, anybody who cares should wind up with at least one copy of this<br/>Rothenberg stuff that he can read and print with a clear conscience....</p><p>The model concerns a code that can be used to extract information from huge<br/>stimulus spaces despite the limitations of the human memory system...</p><p>&#x9;We have hypothesized that when a listener is presented with a series<br/>&#x9;of unfamiliar tonal stimuli, he must mentally construct a reference<br/>&#x9;frame, P, to which all such stimuli are referred.  Many proper P may<br/>&#x9;satisfy this requirement.  If the stimuli are sufficiently unfamiliar<br/>&#x9;(as when one listens to music of an alien culture) many repeated<br/>&#x9;hearings may be necessary during which a listener replaces a familiar<br/>&#x9;P with one more appropriate for classifying the stimuli heard.  The<br/>&#x9;cardinality of the constructed P will depend upon the numbers of<br/>&#x9;distinctions required by the particular musical language or, if the<br/>&#x9;stimuli are not musical, upon the fineness of discrimination required<br/>&#x9;by the recognition task to be performed.</p><p>Once an appropriate P has been found, the next step is to locate a stimulus<br/>within it...</p><p>&#x9;Given any &quot;interval&quot; (pair) in P, the listener is able to recognize<br/>&#x9;the possible positions its elements might occupy in P.  In effect,<br/>&#x9;given any pair of elements he can mentally supply (interpolate) a<br/>&#x9;possible set of remaining elements of P which satisfy the equivalence<br/>&#x9;class and tuning he has learned.  Such an interpolation becomes unique<br/>&#x9;after a sufficient number of elements of P are heard.  This is<br/>&#x9;equivalent to the identification of x (key) in a give P(x).</p><p>&#x9;For example, the major triad [C E G] is not a sufficient subset of the<br/>&#x9;C-major scale since there are two other major scales (namely G and F)<br/>&#x9;in which it occurs.  But C-major is the only major scale which<br/>&#x9;contains the four notes [G B D F], so the &quot;dominant seventh chord&quot; is<br/>&#x9;a sufficient subset of C-major.  A minimal set is a sufficient set<br/>&#x9;with no sufficient subsets.  Thus, [G B D F] is not a minimal set, but<br/>&#x9;[G B F] is, as there is no major scale except C which contains [G B<br/>&#x9;F], while each of its proper subsets [G B] [G F] [B F] are included in<br/>&#x9;some other major scale (G, F, and F# respectively).</p><p>&#x9;It is straightforward to verify that sufficient (and therefore<br/>&#x9;minimal) sets are invariants of equivalence.  They depend only on the<br/>&#x9;equivalence class, not on the particular tuning.</p><p>A measure is developed for this locating...</p><p>&#x9;Consider a language whose alphabet consists of n letters (or<br/>&#x9;phonemes).  How many distinct words can be formed using this<br/>&#x9;alphabet?  Certain restrictions may exist which can limit the<br/>&#x9;sequences of letters that can occur.  The more distinct words that can<br/>&#x9;be formed whose length is less than or equal to some maximal value,<br/>&#x9;the more efficient the alphabet is said to be.</p><p>&#x9;A similar situation applies when &quot;words&quot; are formed from sequences of<br/>&#x9;intervals.  Since interval sequences are formed from tone sequences,<br/>&#x9;we consider sequences of the elements of some P.  Also, since no new<br/>&#x9;intervals are formed when an element is repeated, only non-repeating<br/>&#x9;sequences will be considered.  Since we are here concerned only with<br/>&#x9;properties deriving from the structure of P, we will use the following<br/>&#x9;criterion for the termination of a &quot;word&quot; (other criteria apply when<br/>&#x9;&quot;motifs&quot; are considered): When all remaining elements of P are<br/>&#x9;determined by a sequence of some of its elements, the addition of<br/>&#x9;elements will impart no further information of this type, and the<br/>&#x9;&quot;word&quot; will be considered terminated.  That is, any sequence will be<br/>&#x9;considered complete as soon as a sufficient set occurs in it.</p><p>&#x9;We now ask, given a particular equivalence class, how many distinct<br/>&#x9;words can be formed using k elements where k varies from 1 to n.<br/>&#x9;Consider all non-repeating sequences of n points (there are n! such<br/>&#x9;sequences).  Let S_i be the number of elements in each such sequence<br/>&#x9;which must appear before a sufficient set is encountered.  The F(P) is<br/>&#x9;defined as the average,</p><p>&#x9;n!<br/>&#x9;Sigma(S_i) / n!<br/>&#x9;i=1</p><p>&#x9;F(P) may be interpreted as the average number of elements in a non-<br/>&#x9;repeating sequence of n elements of P(x) required to determine the<br/>&#x9;key, x.  Efficiency, E, is defined as F(P)/n and Redundancy, R, as 1 -<br/>&#x9;F(P)/n.  Both numbers lie between 0 and 1.</p><p>&#x9;It should be noted that this kind of efficiency and redundancy differs<br/>&#x9;from the meanings these terms assume in information theory.  The<br/>&#x9;distinction is important and applies to alphabets in spoken natural<br/>&#x9;languages as well as to musical scales.  The redundancy of information<br/>&#x9;theory refers to a redundancy in the message, not in the code.  In our<br/>&#x9;discussion here, that property of the code which determines whether<br/>&#x9;efficient messages _can_ be constructed (if such are desired) is<br/>&#x9;considered.  This property is inherent in the code itself, and does<br/>&#x9;not apply to the message.</p><p>Rothenberg outlines six scenarios...</p><p>&#x9;  Scale type  Stability    Efficiency<br/>&#x9;(a)  proper       high         high<br/>&#x9;(b)  proper       high         low<br/>&#x9;(c)  proper       low          high<br/>&#x9;(d)  proper       low          low<br/>&#x9;(e)  improper     ----         high<br/>&#x9;(f)  improper     ----         low</p><p>And discusses them...</p><p>&#x9;Notice that in Figure 1, all scales in 12tET with which we are most<br/>&#x9;familiar (the major, minor, and Chinese pentatonic) conform to<br/>&#x9;situation (a).  In fact, the major scale (of which the &quot;natural&quot; minor<br/>&#x9;is a mode) is far higher in both stability and efficiency than any<br/>&#x9;other 7-tone scale.  Next among 7-tone scales is the &quot;melodic&quot; minor<br/>&#x9;(2,2,2,2,1,2,1).  The Chinese pentatonic stands out among scales of 5<br/>&#x9;and 6 tones.</p><p>&#x9;However, situation (b) applies to many scales with which we are<br/>&#x9;familiar, such as the &quot;whole-tone&quot; and &quot;12-tone&quot; scales.  Note that<br/>&#x9;while these are strictly proper scales, from the hearing of a<br/>&#x9;sufficient set (any element) alone, it is not possible to code the<br/>&#x9;elements of P into scale degrees.  That is, although PxP is coded by<br/>&#x9;the proper mapping, there is no way to index elements of P except by<br/>&#x9;arbitrary choice.  __Thus, since in these cases intervals are coded<br/>&#x9;but tones are not, composition with these scales must involve<br/>&#x9;relations which make use of motivic similarities rather than relations<br/>&#x9;between scale degrees.__  Hence the tone row basis of 12-tone music<br/>&#x9;(which is essentially motivic in concept) is not surprising.  An<br/>&#x9;examination of&#x9;Debussy&apos;s whole-tone piano prelude &quot;Violes&quot; show<br/>&#x9;similar motivic&#x9;dependency.</p><p>&#x9;Now consider improper scales.  PxP is not coded except by the<br/>&#x9;employment of proper subsets or a fixed tonic.  __Hence information is<br/>&#x9;primarily communicated by the scale degrees.__  Thus it is important<br/>&#x9;that P be coded as quickly as possible, which is indicated by a high<br/>&#x9;redundancy (low efficiency) as in case (f).  It would be expected that<br/>&#x9;scales characterized by case (e) would be extremely difficult to use,<br/>&#x9;except when the tonic is fixed by a drone or similar device and, in<br/>&#x9;fact, we have not discovered such scales in any musical culture<br/>&#x9;examined thus far.  In general, the use of motivic sequences on<br/>&#x9;different scale degrees of improper scales would not be expected<br/>&#x9;(except within proper subsets of such scales), and this is strongly<br/>&#x9;supported by examination of Indian and other music using improper<br/>&#x9;scales.</p><p>&#x9;We would also expect that proper scales characterized by low stability<br/>&#x9;would tend to be used as improper scales, so that case (c) would<br/>&#x9;resemble case (e), and (d) resemble (f), and similar remarks apply.</p><p>Makes cross-cultural observations...</p><p>&#x9;In Java there exist two scale systems, &quot;Slendro&quot; and &quot;Pelog&quot;, each<br/>&#x9;containing a variety of scales.  It has been observed that all scales<br/>&#x9;in the &quot;Slendro&quot; class are strictly proper and that all in the &quot;Pelog&quot;<br/>&#x9;class are improper.  In a study conducted with the assistance of Mr.<br/>&#x9;Surya Brata of the Ministry of Education and Culture, Jakarta, the<br/>&#x9;uses of these scale systems were observed to be in accord with the<br/>&#x9;predictions of this model.</p><p>References to the Javanese study...</p><p>&#x9;Kunst, J.

These &quot;scales&quot; can vary considerably from one set of<br/>instruments to another, so it&apos;s difficult to make sweeping generalizations.</p><p>Kunst 1949 and Hood 1966 give some tuning data for certain gamelan. In his<br/>pioneering ethnomusicological study of many aspects of Javanese music (not<br/>just tuning), Kunst gives just the middle octave of a single instrument of<br/>a select number of gamelan. Hood (his student) found this approach<br/>insufficient because of the stretching and compression of octaves. That&apos;s<br/>mainly what his 1966 article is about. The 1954 book (basically his<br/>dissertation) is mostly an empirical study of how melodic formulae help<br/>define the patet (roughly, &quot;modes&quot;) of Javanese music. However, the largest<br/>set empirical data of gamelan tunings is in:</p><p>Surjodiningrat, Wasisto, P. J. Sudarjana, and Adhi Susanto.

I have seen this hypothesis,<br/>together with a kind of cycle of &quot;fifths,&quot; proposed by both Javanese and<br/>Western writers. Dan Wolf had some very interesting speculations along<br/>these lines in a Xenharmonikon article, though I remain skeptical about the<br/>9TET connection.</p><p>Though slendro approaches 5TET, very closely in some cases, the differences<br/>are very deliberate and give each version of slendro a different quality.<br/>Tuners and musicians describe these qualities as favoring one patet over<br/>another, thus suggesting that the tunings are being tempered in various<br/>ways to favor (or flavor) different modes, much as irregular temperaments<br/>of the European Baroque favored different keys to a greater or lesser<br/>degree.</p><p>Bill</p><p>^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^<br/>^ Bill Alves                                      email: <a href="mailto:alves@hmc.edu">alves@hmc.edu</a> ^<br/>^ Harvey Mudd College                 URL: <a href="http://www2.hmc.edu/~alves/">http://www2.hmc.edu/~alves/</a> ^<br/>^ 301 E.
