Because 63/32 is present in the<br/>&gt; chord, you get the same 8:9:12 proportions between<br/>&gt; Bb 7/4 - C 63/32 - F 21/16 that you get between<br/>&gt; C 1/1 - D 9/8 - G 3/2.<br/>&gt;<br/>An interesting observation and certainly helpful to fully understanding the<br/>context. However, my delight was simply that the major triad that resulted<br/>sounded quite like &quot;my&quot; high-third major triad (as you acknowledge below).<br/>The fact that the fifth was easy to lock was additional to my main focus.</p><p>Monz continues:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; If you sang the F 21/16 correctly, which as I show above<br/>&gt; you probably did, because it&apos;s easy to hear, then you most<br/>&gt; certainly did hear the 14:18:21 &apos;major triad with high 3rd&apos;.</p><p>Later, responding to my quote:</p><p>&gt;&gt; Bottom line: If that was the 7:9 third, it sounds very close<br/>&gt;&gt; to what I have been calling the &quot;high third.&quot;</p><p>Monz said:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; OK.  But if you&apos;re hearing 7:9 as the &apos;high 3rd&apos; here, you<br/>&gt; should also be hearing it as the &apos;high 3rd&apos; in my MIDI-file<br/>&gt; of your experiment, because it&apos;s exactly the same interval!<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I suggest that the context is playing tricks on you here.</p><p>Something is clearly playing tricks here, but I doubt very much that it has<br/>anything to do with context. I would recognize the locked-in high-third<br/>triad in a hurricane (don&apos;t hold me to that, please). I would think it has<br/>more to do with the transmission and/or playing of the MIDI file. Although I<br/>somewhat agree with your expressed preference for items 3 and 4 (if I<br/>remember correctly), the later items (as played here) sound like something<br/>from Mars. The pitches you identify as 7:9 in the last item on the MIDI file<br/>sound (as played here) nothing like the 7:9 in the drone chord discussed<br/>above--context considered.</p><p>Pending my getting some recordings posted, we could, if you like, let the<br/>matter rest (unless, of course, a brilliant idea flashes).</p><p>Thanks,</p><p>Jerry</p></div><h3>Paul H.

I often<br/>&gt; perform this demonstration (or a close approximation) on my meantone piano<br/>&gt; and my 22-tET guitar. Hopefully, Joe Monzo or someone else will help create<br/>&gt; a MIDI file that will once and for all dispell all doubts that these<br/>&gt; intervals are really one and the same. I strongly encourage the rest of you<br/>&gt; to go over to your synth and try it yourself.</p><p>Okay. Lead on.</p><p>&gt; Report back to us on what you<br/>&gt; hear.</p><p>Will do.</p><p>&gt; Everyone&apos;s been strangely silent on this issue!</p><p>Silent????? Not everyone. :-)<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; First, use 7:9 in a major triad, 7:9:10.5 (aka 14:18:21). Hold this for a<br/>&gt; while. Then drop out the upper voice, and introduce three lower voices,<br/>&gt; forming a 4:5:6:7:9 with the 7:9 held constant. Voila! The interval that was<br/>&gt; once so dissonant is now quite consonant.</p><p>But my synth won&apos;t play ratios--only cents. What now? Okay, I&apos;ll try it<br/>anyway, to see if I can hear the effect you&apos;re talking about.</p><p>&gt; What&apos;s going on here? Just another<br/>&gt; demonstration that context is everything. If the ear can understand the 7:9<br/>&gt; as the seventh and ninth partials of a clear fundamental, it is hearing<br/>&gt; something it is very familiar with. Almost every instrumental timbre has<br/>&gt; seventh and ninth partials -- though they normally go by unnoticed, they can<br/>&gt; be clearly heard if one focuses one&apos;s attention on them. However, in the<br/>&gt; triad 14:18:21, the numbers are too high to unambiguously represent familiar<br/>&gt; partials of a fundamental at 1, 2, 4, 8, or 16 (which would correspond to<br/>&gt; the _second_</p><p>the &quot;second&quot;? Can you use pitch names to help clarify?</p><p>&gt; of this chord).</p><p>of what chord?</p><p>&gt; The ear (actually the brain&apos;s central pitch<br/>&gt; processor) is confused -- it thinks it might be hearing a 4:5:6,</p><p>I believe I can tell the difference between a 4:5:6 and a &quot;high third&quot;<br/>triad. However, I do remember the &quot;illusion&quot; I reported in regard to Joe&apos;s<br/>MIDI experiment. Keep talking.</p><p>&gt; or maybe<br/>&gt; 7:9:11,</p><p>which sounds roughly &quot;augmented&quot; to me. The 2:3 fifth is crucial to a<br/>well-tuned major triad, I would think.</p><p>&gt; or maybe 5:6:7;</p><p>No way! You are kidding, aren&apos;t you?</p><p>&gt; 14:18:21 might even enter in as a weak contender</p><p>Weak????? I thought this was a high possibility in your early posts on this<br/>subject? What changed your thinking? The Monzo MIDI file?</p><p>&gt; if it&apos;s in a high enough register.</p><p>Why high? Midrange chords are easier to hear in tune.</p><p>&gt; This confusion corresponds to a high degree<br/>&gt; of what I call &quot;harmonic entropy&quot;, which is an important component of what<br/>&gt; we call dissonance.</p><p>Paul, I will do the experiment you describe (as best I can) because I<br/>respect your opinion.

And<br/>how utonal chords must above all be played _quietly_. The acoustic guitar<br/>over the phone probably fulfilled both conditions. Listening to Harry Partch<br/>or David Canright at low levels often do too.</p><p>&gt;Why didn&apos;t Joe&apos;s MIDI file?</p><p>The utonal chord has a beautiful configuration of overtones. But when trying<br/>to figure out what the 1/9:1/7:1/6 chord is a set of overtones _of_, the ear<br/>gets pretty confused -- it mainly wants to hear a 4:5:6 major triad, but the<br/>5 (aka major third) is off by 3%. The brain&apos;s central pitch processor, which<br/>is what provides a sensation of &quot;pitch&quot; at the fundamental of every overtone<br/>series it encounters (even if the fundamental is physically absent), and<br/>according to Parncutt provides a sensation of a &quot;root&quot; to chords, has an<br/>accuracy of about 1%. So a 1% deviation from 4:5:6 (as in the 1/24:1/19:1/16<br/>chord) is not a big threat to the clarity of the perception of a fundamental<br/>1 below 4:5:6, while a 3% deviation threatens it greatly.</p><p>The 7:9 interval on its own is generally regarded as falling on the side of<br/>dissonance, especially if not in a high register. The beating and roughness<br/>of the fourth partial of the lower note against the third partial of the<br/>upper note, and especially the fifth partial of the lower note against the<br/>fourth partial of the upper note, tend to be excruciating. However, the<br/>roughness seems to dissolve into a pleasant &quot;periodicity buzz&quot; when a 4:5:6<br/>is placed beneath the 7:9, making for an extremely clear virtual pitch<br/>sensation. In other words, the notes of the chord all blend into one big<br/>note, two octaves below the 4, at 1. This latter effect is what I suggested<br/>someone demonstrate in a MIDI file. Tones resembling Joe&apos;s oboe-like ones<br/>would do nicely.</p></div><h3>Paul H.

An interval within those parameters many be a &quot;perfect<br/>fifth&quot; by concept, but not by a 2:3 by concept.</p><p>If the Harvard Dictionary article is correct that 2:3 is only 2-cents from<br/>tempered and that we can&apos;t perceive such a small difference, then I&apos;m likely<br/>not listening to &quot;cents&quot; when I lock in an acoustic perfect fifth. What&apos;s<br/>more, I can easily tell the difference between a piano fifth and a 2:3 fifth<br/>(assuming that that&apos;s why it appears to lock). In short, if your ear seems<br/>to tolerate a 7 cent deviation from an acoustically tuned 2:3 and it all<br/>sounds &quot;perfectly fine&quot; you cannot be listening to the same 2:3 fifth I am.</p><p>When I sound a tempered fifth on the synth and then adjust the top pitch by<br/>1-cent increments, there is no point at which I hear a locked acoustic<br/>perfect fifth. I can, as you appear to be doing, recognize the interval as a<br/>&quot;perfect fifth&quot; (in the &quot;what is this interval&quot; sense) as opposed to a minor<br/>sixth or augmented fourth. (How different does a dog have to be to begin<br/>resembling a bear? Of course, there is no perfect dog; but there is a<br/>perfect [apparently]) fifth.</p><p>Play a simple-timbre low pitch and hum the fifth (better yet, the twelfth)<br/>above, moving it slightly up and down until it finds &quot;peace&quot; (the very<br/>bottom of Helmholtz&quot;s &quot;trough.&quot; There is very little (if any) room to be<br/>moving around, particularly 7 cents worth.</p><p>I suspect that your &quot;perfectly fine&quot; is referring to recognition of a<br/>&quot;perfect fifth,&quot; not to a perceptually locked 2:3 consonance. Right? Wrong?<br/>I&apos;m all ears.</p><p>&gt; I can get a 7:9 (which sounds &quot;locked&quot; when I use distortion to<br/>&gt; help bring out the missing fundamental) anywhere on my 22-tone guitar -- the<br/>&gt; fact that it&apos;s 1 cent sharp doesn&apos;t bother me in the least.</p><p>Perhaps you are experiencing the psychological correction you referred to<br/>elsewhere in which the ear &quot;improves&quot; the tuning. In such a case, you would<br/>&quot;hear&quot; the 7:9 &quot;concept&quot; just so long as the pitches are in that vicinity.<br/>Your experience with 7:9 would then allow you to &quot;hear&quot; the implied root<br/>even when the 7:9(?) tuning is slightly off.</p><p>I understand the principle that well-tuned intervals (apparently with<br/>considerable deviation) will &quot;suggest&quot; an implied fundamental to an<br/>experienced ear. However, such intervals can also lock acoustically (shall<br/>we say) with the kind of precision I described above. For example, over a<br/>sustained pitch hum a locked major third (4:5), then slide the hummed pitch<br/>downward extremely slowly and listen to the lock points at 5:6 (implying the<br/>third and fifth of a major triad), at 6:7 (implying the fifth and<br/>flat-seventh of a dominant seventh chord), at 7:8 (implying the &quot;blue&quot;<br/>seventh below a tonic), at 8:9 (implying tonic and supertonic).</p><p>Similarly, slide the well-tuned upper pitch of 4:5 slowly upward to lock in<br/>a 7:9. There is a very precise spot at which it locks, just like the others.</p><p>Here is my reasoning. Please tell me (and I know by now that you will) if<br/>this logic misfires in any way. Just as we can lock in the flat-3 when<br/>sliding the third of a major third downward to transform the chord to minor,<br/>I suspect that we can lock in a &quot;high third&quot; by sliding the 4:5 third of a<br/>major chord upward to lock in what seems to be a 7:9 &quot;third.&quot;</p><p>What remains of this &quot;mystery,&quot; is to explain why singers move the 4:5 third<br/>upward (above tempered) when the fifth is sounding.

Most synths that I am aware of have a true internal tuning table that<br/>divides the octave into 512 or 768 equal parts. Cents values on the front<br/>panel are rounded internally to one of those systems. So most likely, your<br/>synth&apos;s &quot;702&#xFFFD; interval&quot; is actually being &quot;rounded&quot; to 703.125&#xFFFD; or<br/>701.5625&#xFFFD;. These values correspond to beat rates between the third partial<br/>of A-440 and the second partial of the approximate E-660 of 0.9 Hz and 0.3<br/>Hz respectively. You should be able to hear this beating clearly on your<br/>synth (first, make sure you&apos;re using a tone with no chorus effects or<br/>anything; then, play the chord and concentrate on hearing out the pitch of<br/>the high E partial; then, count how many seconds it takes to beat -- about<br/>once per second or once per three seconds?).

When an interval is sung or played on<br/>instruments of variable pitch, there is a large amount of unsteadiness in<br/>pitch levels. (Portamento, vibrato, chorus effects etc., whether intended or<br/>accidental are almost inevitable).  The target interval of the players is<br/>often not really hit but passed through by the transient signals. My<br/>impression is that in such situations, listeners, in effect, &quot;sample&quot; the<br/>interval at the optimum, &quot;locking&quot;, position.</p><p>In contrast, listeners respond to intervals played on instruments of fixed<br/>pitch much less forgivingly because there is none of the gray area around<br/>the intervals found with voices or variable-pitch instruments.

It seems a<br/>&gt;&gt; real stretch to me to think that human ears hear in such terms.<br/>&gt;<br/>and then Bob Valentine commented:</p><p>&gt; But your own &apos;high third&apos; appears AFTER a fifth is introduced. Somehow, the<br/>&gt; fifth influences the singers choice of third.</p><p>Bob, the topic was the _Pythagorean third, which requires that the third is<br/>high because of the piling of four 2:3 fifths. My &quot;demo&quot; suggests that the<br/>ear prefers the high third upon the sounding of _one third.</p><p>Incidentally, I mentioned recently that once conditioned to the high third a<br/>performer can use it consistently whether or not the fifth is sounding. The<br/>focus of my &quot;research&quot; here is to find out why experienced singers and<br/>string players hear the high third as a &quot;lock&quot; and whether the &quot;demo&quot;<br/>contains a clue in that novice ears consistently move the 4:5 third up to<br/>the high position when the fifth is introduced.</p><p>Bob continues:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Now for a few changes of subject.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I&apos;m very interested in how some of these issues<br/>&gt; are dealt with in the melody. For instance, singing in C, if the melody goes<br/>&gt; C-D-E, do you give any consideration to evening out the two &apos;tones?&apos;</p><p>Everything is dependent on the prevailing harmony. If the C-D-E is sung by a<br/>tuning-aware singer, it is the C and the E that is structural. The common<br/>view of melody as simply &quot;a series of pitches&quot; is short sighted. In tonal<br/>music, melody anchors to the prevailing harmony. I teach my students to be<br/>aware of implied harmony as they sight read a tonal melody.</p><p>In the case you cite above, if the D is sung quickly as a passing tone, it<br/>may or may not be treated as an 8:9, depending on the care and experience of<br/>the singer. If the D is sustained for any appreciable duration, it is more<br/>likely to be tuned to 8:9, I would think.</p><p>Regarding &quot;evening out&quot; the two steps, I have observed that beginning<br/>students have far more trouble singing whole and half steps accurately than<br/>singing thirds and fifths. I think the traditional method of &quot;teaching&quot;<br/>scales before skips goes against the way we &quot;naturally&quot; perceive pitch<br/>relationships--namely, by acoustic intervals. My beginning students have a<br/>much easier time with 1-3-5 than with 1-2-3.</p><p>Incidentally, a tuning-aware singer can tune &quot;acoustically&quot; (largely by<br/>memory and habit) when performing with a piano or guitar just so long as the<br/>accompaniment stays off the melody line (a practice followed by any good<br/>accompanist to allow the singer rhythmic freedom as well as tuning freedom).</p><p>&gt; Does this<br/>&gt; contribut to arriving at a &apos;high third&apos;?</p><p>I don&apos;t think &quot;evening out&quot; the steps would contribute to arriving at the<br/>high third. I think the tuning of the E is anticipated by the singer even<br/>before the D is sounded. However, the reverse may be true: that once the E<br/>is imagined, the D is simply &quot;plopped&quot; in somewhere around the middle of the<br/>major third.</p><p>&gt; Similarly, in C, if the melody is<br/>&gt; going G-A-B, lets assume a V chord, are the &apos;tones&apos; even and is the B a &apos;high<br/>&gt; third&apos; to the G?</p><p>The same considerations would apply to the tuning of the dominant seventh<br/>chord members.</p><p>&gt; And how do you deal with punning? For instance, the end of the bridge to<br/>&gt; the song &quot;All the Things you are&quot; has a sustained G# which crosses from the<br/>&gt; key of E (where the bridge ended) to the #5 on a C7 chord and becomes an Ab<br/>&gt; on the F- chord which is the vi in the orginal key (Ab) that we&apos;ve returned<br/>&gt; to. Would you interpret the &quot;E&quot; as Fb and the C7#5 is a C7b13???</p><p>In our (LA Jazz Choir singers) experience, pitches often &quot;float&quot; a bit when<br/>chords are connected with distantly related roots. Assuming an a cappella<br/>situation, I can imagine two scenarios. In the first, the melody&apos;s G#/Ab is<br/>sung so forcefully that the other singers simply adjust to that pitch. Also,<br/>a pitch-aware singer(s) might purposefully sing the the G# in a &quot;low third&quot;<br/>tuning, remembering where the original key was, anticipating the Ab needed<br/>for the return.</p><p>In the second scenario, the singers collectively compromise (including the<br/>lead line), intuitively locking the modulatory chord (C7#5/C7b13) to the<br/>destination tonality. In this case the G# might &quot;float&quot; into the Ab as the<br/>ensemble moves back to the original key. Fortunately for them, singers and<br/>string players don&apos;t have to make these decisions consciously, as<br/>microtonalists clearly must. By some miracle they manage to end up in the<br/>same key they started in. (Elsewhere, I described the 2.5 minutes of a<br/>cappella &quot;Midnight Sun,&quot; a highly chromatic song, that held tonic _every<br/>time it was sung. I would love to post it but that much music would be a<br/>very large file and I&apos;m over my Earthlink limit.)</p><p>I hope this is helpful, Bob. Remember, it is simply my opinion based on<br/>considerable experience and some knowledge of acoustics and music theory and<br/>is not offered as &quot;Truth.&quot;</p><p>Jerry</p></div><h3>Carl Lumma &#x3C;CLUMMA@NNI.COM&#x3E;</h3><span>2/25/2000 6:32:56 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>&gt;&gt;I saw a post on Usenet recently where somebody said that parallel major<br/>&gt;&gt;thirds increase the tension.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;Parallel _major_ thirds would be a very non-diatonic phenomenon (q.v. _Close<br/>&gt;to the Edge_ by Yes) and increase tension due to its borrowing from distant<br/>&gt;keys.</p><p>Woohoo!</p><p>&gt;In normal music, thirds are hidden away inside chords.

I doubt it.</p><p>Locking is a relative thing. If you&apos;re holding a fifth and moving the third<br/>around, you will notice greater and lesser degrees of locking at different<br/>intervals, as lower or higher harmonics become beatless. If you just play a<br/>triad with a given third, it&apos;s hard to know whether it&apos;s locked or not,<br/>since in addition to the beatless harmonics, there will be many beating<br/>ones. I think it would be possible with some timbres, if one consciously<br/>listens to the harmonic four octaves above the fifth, to tune a<br/>1/24:1/19:1/16 triad by ear. When experimenting with dyads using sawtooth<br/>waves, I recorded all intervals at which I heard a &quot;lock&quot; and the most<br/>complex was 17:13. With triads, I suspect higher numbers (maybe as high as<br/>24) could enter the picture. Ken Wauchope reported tuning ratios with<br/>numbers up to 24 (those with numbers 19-24 he termed &quot;difficult&quot;) in his<br/>careful listening experiments.</p><p>If Jerry is right and singers produce locked triads with just fifths, but<br/>major thirds significantly higher than 12-tET, then this seems like the best<br/>candidate for an explanation. If the &quot;locking&quot; is illusory, but the<br/>sharpness relative to 12-tET is real, then perhaps a Pythagorean explanation<br/>based on some sort of extended reference via imagined tones is a possible<br/>hypothesis that can be entertained. I&apos;d be very skeptical, though.</p></div><h3>Gerald Eskelin &#x3C;stg3music@earthlink.net&#x3E;</h3><span>2/27/2000 5:13:35 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>To my comment:</p><p>&gt;&gt;As I mentioned to some members off-List, I guess I had initially assumed<br/>&gt;&gt;that many here would have already experienced the &quot;high third&quot; phenomenon.<br/>&gt;&gt;It soon was clear that most of the members approach tuning from a<br/>&gt;&gt;historical/keyboard point of view and that this was not the case.</p><p>Carl Lumma responded:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Jerry, I&apos;ve sung in choirs for years, and I&apos;m sure I&apos;ve sung many thirds<br/>&gt; sharper than any interval you&apos;d care to name... but I can&apos;t say I have ever<br/>&gt; noticed a &quot;pull&quot; for harmonic major thirds other than 5/4.
