He speaks as if tonality was nothing more than one chord, the tonic<br/>chord. As you know, I (perhaps indoctrinated by contemporary theory :))<br/>believe that tonality is founded, instead, on not only the tonicity of the<br/>tonic chord but also the resolving tendencies of the notes in the scale.<br/>While Partch might lead you to believe that the major-minor duality in<br/>Western music is nothing more than the Otonal-Utonal duality in the<br/>particular case of the 5-limit, the fact of the matter is that we had not<br/>two but six or seven equally viable modes in Western music, and it was only<br/>through the increasing use of dissonance in the Baroque period that the<br/>tritone achieved its pivotal role as the characteristic dissonance of the<br/>diatonic scale, and the resolving tendencies of the tritone reduced the<br/>number of viable modes to two: major and minor. The fact that this duality,<br/>by conicidence, appears parallel to the otonal-utonal duality, and that this<br/>parallelism is linguistically supported, may have misled Partch, and may be<br/>misleading you now.</p><p>Just my humble opinion.</p></div>
