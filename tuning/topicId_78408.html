I&apos;m finally getting better acquinated with XHTML and CSS, many years late.</p><p>Anyway, this is what I was talking about earlier - my own system of accidentals for 72 equal temperament. The GIF file is a rough draft.</p><p><a href="http://www.geocities.com/dawier/xtc_acc.gif">http://www.geocities.com/dawier/xtc_acc.gif</a></p><p>The name XTC stands for &quot;eXtended Tartini-Couper&quot;, and is pronounced like &apos;ecstasy&apos;. I simply took Tartini-Couper accidentals, which represent pitch shifts of a multiple of three twelfth-tones (50 cents in 72et); up and down arrows affixed to an accidental indicates the pitch is shifted up or down one twelfth of a tone (16 2/3 cents).</p><p>I could also call it TCB, for &quot;Tartini-Couper-Bart&iuml;&iquest;&half;k&quot;, since the Hungarian composer used arrows to indicate small adjustments in pitch for folk melodies. (TCB, as you should know, also stands for &quot;taking care of business&quot;.)</p><p>And Ozan, you could use this for your 79-tone tuning if you want.</p><p>I&apos;m also wondering about this document:</p><p><a href="http://www.scribd.com/doc/4438359/Introduction-to-QuarterTone-Music">http://www.scribd.com/doc/4438359/Introduction-to-QuarterTone-Music</a></p><p>On page 14, the author, whose name I can&apos;t find, cites the same system as &quot;Skinner&quot;, listing a comparison of these accidentals with those of Blackwood, H&iuml;&iquest;&half;ba and Wyschnegradsky. I&apos;m Googling for anyone named Skinner that ever worked in quarter-tone music, and found a dissertation written by one Myles Skinner: <a href="http://www.tierceron.com/diss/diss.html">http://www.tierceron.com/diss/diss.html</a>. (Is he claiming Tartini-Couper accidentals as his own?)</p><p>Anyway, this is what I&apos;m using in my scores for now. I&apos;m already used to using TC quarter-tone accidentals, so adding arrows was just a logical extension.</p><p>~D.</p></div>
