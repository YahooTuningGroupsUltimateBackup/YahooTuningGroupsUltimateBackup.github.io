After I got back, I<br/>was enthusiastic about learning more about Kyle Gann&apos;s and David<br/>Doty&apos;s Just Intonation notation.  (Should we call it &quot;Intonotation?&quot;)</p><p>So, that led to a fascinating reappraisal of Ben Johnston&apos;s Just<br/>notation and his beautiful String Quartets and well as the<br/>interesting Perspectives of New Music article you suggested.</p><p>From there, the suggestion of emulating Just through 72-tET started,<br/>but I wanted a smaller set to work with, and was hoping for a set of<br/>(about) 19-tones per octave which emulated Just through 72-tET.</p><p>Some of our &quot;geniuses&quot;  (well, I was called one *too* once, ha,<br/>ha...) got working and, from the womb of the Tuning List, 21-note<br/>*Blackjack* tuning was born along with a consensus ascii version of<br/>Sims 72-tET notation.</p><p>And the world has never been the same....  :)</p><p>JP</p></div><h3><a id=34500 href="#34500">ðŸ”—</a>D.Stearns &#x3C;STEARNS@CAPECOD.NET&#x3E;</h3><span>2/19/2002 8:58:56 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Hi Joe,</p><p>Whatever you think is best and would like to do there is fine with<br/>me--I use the crosshatch modified Sims-Maneri accidentals on scores<br/>and whatever best fits with what everyone else is using for ascii<br/>email purposes.
