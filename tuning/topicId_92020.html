For those who may find it more convenient to download a<br/>Scala file directly rather than to cut and paste from this post, I&apos;ve<br/>included a URL:</p><p>&lt;<a href="http://www.bestII.com/~mschulter/simplemint24.scl">http://www.bestII.com/~mschulter/simplemint24.scl</a>&gt;</p><p>! simplemint24.scl<br/>!<br/>Rank 3 temperament (2-3-7-9-11-13), 704c 5th, 58c spacing (1200-EDO)<br/> 24<br/>!<br/> 58.00000<br/> 128.00000<br/> 186.00000<br/> 208.00000<br/> 266.00000<br/> 288.00000<br/> 346.00000<br/> 416.00000<br/> 474.00000<br/> 496.00000<br/> 554.00000<br/> 624.00000<br/> 682.00000<br/> 704.00000<br/> 762.00000<br/> 832.00000<br/> 890.00000<br/> 912.00000<br/> 970.00000<br/> 992.00000<br/> 1050.00000<br/> 1120.00000<br/> 1178.00000<br/> 2/1</p><p>One lesson of this tuning for me is that 1200-EDO doesn&apos;t have to mean<br/>&quot;inaccurate.&quot; We&apos;ll see, using for example George Secor&apos;s High<br/>Tolerance Temperament in 29 notes (HTT-29) with its tolerance of about<br/>3.25 cents as a standard, that lots of intervals of 2-3-7-9-11-13 are<br/>within that tolerance.</p><p>How do we give an overview, at a glance, of what resources are<br/>available? Scala&apos;s SHOW INTERVALS or SHOW /LINE INTERVALS provide one<br/>handy solution, of course: but here are some ideas for one alternative<br/>format for sharing some information about a rank 3 system.</p><p>We might begin by listing the three generators of a rank 3 temperament:</p><p>  (r3=   g1     g2     g3<br/>       1200.0, 704.0, 58.0 )</p><p>The next thing we might want to know is what intervals we&apos;ll find, and<br/>how many of them in a tuning of a specific size, here 24. The<br/>following two &quot;family analysis&quot; tables do this. The first takes the<br/>bottom note of the lower 12-note chain as the 1/1 (actually the<br/>288-cent step, step 6 in the Scala file) and lists the intervals we<br/>get first moving through this chain (itself a rank 2 temperament), and<br/>then moving from the bottom to the top of the second chain:</p><p>  families:<br/>  [ FAM1-r2:  704  208  912  416 1120  624<br/>    FAM2-r2:  128  832  336 1040  544<br/>    FAM3-r3:   58  762  266  970  474<br/>    FAM4-r3: 1178  682  186  890  394  1098 602 ]</p><p>Note that the intervals are grouped into four &quot;families.&quot; The first<br/>has the &quot;regular diatonic&quot; intervals; the second the &quot;Zalzalian&quot; or<br/>neutral intervals (singly augmented or diminished in conventional<br/>naming); the third the &quot;septimal&quot; intervals; and the fourth the more<br/>remote intervals, which sometimes have a 5-limit or meantone flavor.<br/>While the first two families are present in a single 12-note chain<br/>(rank 2), the third and fourth involve the 58-cent generator of the<br/>rank 3 system.</p><p>Additionally, there are some intervals not encountered above which we<br/>can find by setting our 1/1 as the note at the high end of the first<br/>12-note chain of fifths, and then moving from the bottom to the top of<br/>the second chain. These &quot;supplemental&quot; intervals follow the same sequence as the rank 2 intervals of the first and second families in the previous<br/>table, with each of these intervals 10 cents larger than its rank 2<br/>counterpart above, except for the 58-cent generator itself which is<br/>the last interval in this table, and in a system with longer rank 2<br/>chains would have the 48-cent enharmonic diesis formed from 12 fifths up<br/>as its counterpart, thus also fitting this pattern:</p><p>  families (supplemental r3, from +11=544.0)<br/>    [ 714  218  922   426  1130  634<br/>      138  842  346  1050   554   58 ]</p><p>Some of these are very important: our approximations of 13/9, 13/12,<br/>13/8, 11/9, 11/6, and 11/8 -- and all within 3 cents of just.</p><p>Of course, there are the prime approximations! The following table<br/>lists the relevant primes (2-3-7-11-13), shows the rank 2 or rank 3<br/>chain or combination of generators to best approximate each prime, the size of the tempered interval in cents used for each<br/>approximation, the difference from JI in cents, and the _number_ of<br/>locations at which this approximation is available.</p><p>  primes:<br/>  &lt;     2        3       7        11       13<br/>        r2       r2      r3       r3       r3<br/>      period     +1    +3/+g3   -1/+g3   -4/+g3<br/>    1200.000  704.000  970.000  554.000  842.000<br/>        J      +2.045   +1.174   +2.682   +1.472<br/>                n=22     n=9      n=11     n=8    &gt;</p><p>The third line of this table, showing chain or combination of<br/>generators for each approximated prime, may call for explanation. For<br/>a rank 2 approximation, within a single chain of fifths, we simply<br/>show the number of fifths up (+) or down (-). For rank 3, we show two<br/>factors: the number of fifths to move up or down on a single chain,<br/>plus the addition or subtraction of the third generator (g3), here at<br/>58 cents (+g3 or -g3).</p><p>Thus to get a 7/4 minor seventh, we move up three fifths (+3),<br/>arriving at a 912-cent major sixth; plus up the third generator (+g3)<br/>of 58 cents, arriving at 970 cents. The +g3 sign tells us that we must<br/>be able to add this 58 cent generator, and thus we must start from a<br/>note on the _lower_ 12-note chain, and more specifically one which has<br/>a major sixth at 3 fifths up (+3), of which there are 9.</p><p>The last item, the number of locations where an interval is available,<br/>is something that David Keenan rightly pointed to as a very important<br/>factor in assessing &quot;chain-of-fifth&quot; tunings; and it is relevant to<br/>rank 2 and rank 3 temperaments alike, especially for smaller tuning<br/>sets. (And on this list, 24 might still be considered a &quot;small&quot; set.)</p><p>Finally, in addition to primes, we just might be looking for things<br/>like neutral or middle seconds at or close to superparticular ratios. The following</p><p>  superparticular middle seconds:<br/>  {  14:13     13:12     12:11     11:10<br/>       r2        r3        r3        r2<br/>       +7     -5/+g3    +2/-g3      -10<br/>    128.000   138.000   150.000   160.000<br/>     -0.298    -0.573    -0.637    -5.004<br/>      n=10      n=7       n=10      n=4   }</p><p>Again, the third line tells us, if the approximation is available in a<br/>single rank 2 chain, how many fifths we must move up or down -- for<br/>example, +7 for 14:13 (the apotome or chromatic semitone). And for<br/>rank 3 approximations, we have first motion along a single chain, and<br/>then the addition or subtraction of the 58-cent generator. Thus to get<br/>a 13:12 approximation, we first move 5 fifths down (arriving at a<br/>limma or diatonic semitone at 80 cents), and then up by 58 cents (+g3)<br/>to arrive at 138 cents.</p><p>Similarly, to approximate 12:11, we start by moving up two fifths (+2)<br/>on the chain of fifths, arriving at a 208-cent tone or major second,<br/>and then down by the 58-cent third generator (-g3) to arrive at 150<br/>cents.</p><p>As with the prime approximations, it&apos;s helpful to know not only how,<br/>and how accurately, an interval is approximated, but at how many<br/>locations, and this information is duly included on the last line of<br/>the table.</p><p>Best,</p><p>Margo Schulter<br/>mschulter@...</p></div><h3>genewardsmith &#x3C;genewardsmith@...&#x3E;</h3><span>8/27/2010 5:35:49 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, Margo Schulter &lt;mschulter@...&gt; wrote:</p><p>&gt;    primes:<br/>&gt;    &lt;     2        3       7        11       13<br/>&gt;          r2       r2      r3       r3       r3<br/>&gt;        period     +1    +3/+g3   -1/+g3   -4/+g3<br/>&gt;      1200.000  704.000  970.000  554.000  842.000<br/>&gt;          J      +2.045   +1.174   +2.682   +1.472<br/>&gt;                  n=22     n=9      n=11     n=8    &gt;</p><p>Another way to denote this is<br/>[&lt;1  0 * 1  4  6|,<br/> &lt;0  1 * 3 -1 -4|,<br/> &lt;0  0 * 3  1  1|]</p><p>Here the asterisks mean the 5 is omitted, though alternatively you could map to 0. This leads to a rank three no-fives system tempering out 352/351 and 364/363 (and hence their product, 896/891.) Or you could leave 5 in it and get a rank four system instead, which Graham seems to be calling 34 &amp; 41 &amp; 58 &amp; 87.</p></div>
