If the vibrato is a function of a synth patch, the patch<br/>can be reprogrammed. If the vibrato is part of a sample, then one<br/>might need to try a different sample. And one can always make vibrato<br/>on a note controlable by a midi control message, thereby allowing one<br/>to not only turn it on and off, but increase or reduce it by gradual<br/>degrees, returning it to it&apos;s function as an expressive element.</p><p>Didn&apos;t mean to use your original posting to leap into the realm of<br/>ultra-drudgery, but the topic of appropriate realism in orchestral<br/>mock-ups is one that gets revisited occasionally, especially as our<br/>tools improve - though microtonality is still lagging behind 12tet<br/>electronic compositing...</p><p>Cheers,<br/>Jon</p></div>
