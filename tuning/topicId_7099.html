Just because Paul E mentioned it maybe 86 times?<br/>&gt;&gt;Okay, I guess that&apos;s important enough. Did Forte actually say<br/>&gt;&gt;something significant? Perhaps I was too young to notice.</p><p>[Paul Erlich:]<br/>&gt;Look, you can drop the attitude -- John said he hadn&apos;t studied<br/>&gt;classical tonal analysis and I thought I&apos;d give him an example where he<br/>&gt;could learn about diatonic chord functions, linear harmonic devices,<br/>&gt;etc., in the context of the Western common-practice repertoire. I<br/>&gt;suppose you&apos;d do away with all classical tonal analysis and replace it<br/>&gt;with . . . ?</p><p>I don&apos;t know if Gerald meant his comment in an &quot;attitude&quot; way, but...<br/>What&apos;s ironic is that I of all people may be the biggest &quot;out with the<br/>old and in with the new&quot; guy on this whole list.  OK, so that&apos;s an<br/>exaggeration, and, right, Margo, I&apos;ve gotta emphasize that the &quot;old&quot; is<br/>just fine too...  BUT, I&apos;d be really dumb not to want to tap into<br/>significant bits of theory here and there, stuff that was in the heads<br/>of people as they composed in the past.  I respect Paul&apos;s knowledge,<br/>and since I wanted to read something of the sort, it seems smart to take<br/>his recommendation.  If I decide it&apos;s not useful to what I&apos;m trying to<br/>do, at least I&apos;ll be able to answer Paul&apos;s posts better than I can now!</p><p>BTW, the Australian Connection for Forte&apos;s &quot;Tonal Harmony in Concept and<br/>Practice&quot; fell thru: turned out someone else beat me to it!  But John<br/>Starrett in Denver has offered to loan me his till I find one.</p><p>JdL</p></div>
