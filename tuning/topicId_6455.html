Erlich &#x3C;PErlich@xxxxxxxxxxxxx.xxxx&#x3E;</h3><span>11/30/1999 9:47:43 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>I wrote,</p><p>&gt;&gt;Though I would agree (perhaps strongly) with Margo, it should be pointed<br/>out<br/>&gt;&gt;that there is no record of Bach ever mentioning a subtly graduated scale<br/>of<br/>&gt;&gt;tension among the keys. Although quantitative studies of the WTC appear to<br/>&gt;&gt;reveal that its composition was indeed informed by such a tuning,</p><p>Carl Lumma wrote,</p><p>&gt;I&apos;ve read this in several places, but can&apos;t remember any convincing<br/>&gt;examples.</p><p>The studies to this effect assumed that a fixed set of 12 pitches applied to<br/>all the pieces, optimized the tuning of consonant intervals weighted by<br/>frequency and duration, and came out with some kind of irregular<br/>well-temperament that favored the &quot;easy&quot; keys.</p><p>&gt;I am more inclined to accept Everett Hafner&apos;s thesis, that the<br/>&gt;tuning wrench was to be used before each piece.  Two points on Hafner&apos;s<br/>&gt;article:</p><p>&gt;1. He suggests that if the WTC was performed by order of 5ths rather than<br/>&gt;number it would support his thesis, but the WTC was not meant to be<br/>&gt;performed as a whole at all, and almost certainly was not during Bach&apos;s<br/>&gt;lifetime.</p><p>&gt;2. The second book is much less forgiving than the first as far a staying<br/>&gt;within the consonant areas of one 12-tone meantone key.  And what was Bach<br/>&gt;to do at the organ -- his organ book is the most chromatic of all his<br/>output.</p><p>It sounds like you&apos;re not agreeing with Hafner at all. Why are you inclined<br/>to accept his thesis, then?</p><p>&gt;Some points of interest here: 1. Was the composition then so tailored to<br/>&gt;the specific key of irregular temperament?</p><p>I don&apos;t believe it was tailored at all, let alone &quot;so tailored&quot;.</p><p>&gt;&gt;All we know for sure is that, once he had adopted the premise of a closed<br/>12<br/>&gt;&gt;tone temperament, Bach instructed that the major thirds be tuned sharp in<br/>&gt;&gt;order to achieve that end.</p><p>&gt;Bach is definitely on record for preferring closed temperament.  There&apos;s<br/>&gt;even a story relayed by Bosanquet of Bach playing in the worst keys on a<br/>&gt;meantone organ when its builder was around, to annoy him.</p><p>Exactly. However, let&apos;s not forget that Bach had a long career as a<br/>composer, and through the early part of that career, his music was<br/>restricted to the ordinary meantone gamut of pitches; and only when his<br/>music became more abstract and keyboard-oriented did he modulate so much<br/>that a closed temperament became necessary.</p></div>
