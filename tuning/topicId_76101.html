First Promethean, which<br/>uses all of the unaccented symbols, then Herculean which introduces<br/>left accents corresponding to a 5-schisma shift (approx 2 cents).</p><p>Then we have the realm of the gods, the Olympian level, which<br/>introduces the right accents, both single and double, which correspond<br/>to various schisminas of around 0.3 cents. We expect that mere mortals<br/>will only use this level for theoretical purposes.</p><p>-- Dave Keenan</p></div>
