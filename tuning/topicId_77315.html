I don&apos;t know how a Linux kernel can be proprietary.  It also has its own GUI which you can run on a standard Linux kernel and is in the Debian repositories.</p><p>Yes, it uses Csound.  The description&apos;s here:</p><p><a href="http://wiki.laptop.org/go/Csound">http://wiki.laptop.org/go/Csound</a></p><p>Why do you want a Scala file plug-in?  Csound&apos;s pitch support is much more flexible than what Scala files provide.</p><p>The application for children is here:</p><p><a href="http://wiki.laptop.org/go/TamTam">http://wiki.laptop.org/go/TamTam</a></p><p>I can&apos;t find any mention of the standard tuning.  As the target instruments from (among other countries) Nigeria and Thailand, we shouldn&apos;t assume equal temperament.  If they use it anyway, no problem, you can go in and change the Csound orchestras.</p><p>It does, indeed, have an unfinished look and they&apos;re working on group improvisations.</p><p>Most significantly for the microtonal community, the OLPC project has given us a Csound sample library:</p><p><a href="http://wiki.laptop.org/go/Sound_samples">http://wiki.laptop.org/go/Sound_samples</a></p><p>Prent said on MMM (I think) that this is all microtonal friendly.  And, indeed, I&apos;ve heard that the Csound that the XO ships with doesn&apos;t include the Fluid opcodes, which handle SoundFonts in an evil, not-easily-microtunable way. That means anything it can do must be tunable.</p><p>This is an excellent resource for all those microtonalists who weren&apos;t using Csound before because it didn&apos;t have a standard instrument library.</p><p>                      Graham</p></div>
