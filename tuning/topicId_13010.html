Because adjacent strings are tuned to pure fifths, not 12t-<br/>ET fifths, I figured quite a few open string notes would be out of<br/>tune if I tried to play with a pianist.  In practicing my C, D, and G<br/>major scales from the first position -all of which use the open<br/>string notes extensively - I too have heard open string notes to be<br/>slightly out of tune with respect to the original fundamental.</p><p>I&apos;ve pondered the same issues with my fretless guitar and, soon,<br/>fretless bass guitar.  If I just tune one of the strings to A=440<br/>then tune the other strings to beatless harmonics, then the<br/>instrument being tuned would be in tune only for music with A=440 as<br/>the fundamental.  So I&apos;ve &quot;relapsed&quot; into tuning the open strings to<br/>12t-ET notes as I haven&apos;t settled on a specific scale to use on the<br/>instrument.</p><p>Paolo</p></div><h3><a id=13048 href="#13048">ðŸ”—</a>Paul H.

Anyway, upon<br/>rereading it, I have a much better understanding of the comma problem.</p><p>I have to admit I know very little about meantone and in the process<br/>of reviewing the material on Kyle Gann&apos;s and Graham Breed&apos;s<br/>websites.  I suppose after I am done I will have to decide on a<br/>reference pitch to use and on some mapping issues (the material<br/>appears to be piano-oriented with discussion centering on C-reference<br/>pitch scales).  Who knows, maybe I&apos;ll just end up using the E, A, D,<br/>and G pitches as tuned to 1/4 comma meantone on C reference.  I&apos;ll<br/>figure out what to do with that B string...  At least my fretless<br/>bass will be covered.</p><p>Thanks for the suggestion of meantone, Paul.  I&apos;m looking into it.</p><p>Paolo</p></div>
