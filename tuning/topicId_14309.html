At a party, I heard and made a recording of an amazing band<br/>of terrific musicians. I posted a copy of one of their pieces on<br/><a href="http://MP3.com">MP3.com</a> yesterday, in the Mariachi section, under<br/><a href="http://www.mp3.com/OmarBandeleros">http://www.mp3.com/OmarBandeleros</a> .  Take a listen and let me know<br/>what you think; I swear I hear some 7:4&apos;s 11:8&apos;s, and other<br/>microtones in their playing.</p><p>Omar y los Bandeleros play every Friday night for the wealthy retired<br/>Americans in Ajijic, mostly Mariachi Music in the Moonlight at the<br/>Posada in town. But on Saturday nights they move to the school gym<br/>off the town square and step up the tempo.</p><p>Omar is the band&apos;s leader, and tuba player. His wife Angelina plays<br/>the piccolo. Omar is tall and thin and has a neatly trimmed mustache.<br/>Angelina has let her weight get away from her, and is pushing 120<br/>kilos, easy. Earlier, on the night these recordings were made,<br/>Angelina and Omar had been fighting over something. Enrique, the lead<br/>trumpeter said it was over Omar losing money at the cock fights.<br/>Roberto, the bongo player, felt that Angelina was angry over Omar<br/>spending all Friday afternoon helping the new guitar player, Rosa,<br/>learn the changes in his shuffle. Angelina felt the new changes were<br/>not all for the good, if you know what I mean.</p><p>Omar wanted to diffuse the situation by playing some romantic music<br/>with Angelina, and that is how this tune starts. Francesco the<br/>marimba player begins the tune with a gently rocking ostinato in C<br/>major otonality. Omar entices Angelina to join in with a sweet bass<br/>line on his tuba. Hector and his trombone section join in to<br/>complement the sound. When Rosa joins in on guitar, the pace quickens<br/>rapidly. Pretty soon the tempo and the heat rise as it becomes clear<br/>Angelina wants more than sweet music from Omar. The group is rocking<br/>through some bizarre changes at 150 bpm.</p><p>After this recording was made, Omar left the stage with Angelina, and<br/>the remainder of the band finished out the set without them. Rosa was<br/>asked to leave the band the next day, and has been hanging out in<br/>Colorado with a guy named Nelson in Durango, driving a Suburban into<br/>town every day to pick up her mail and her royalty checks. Omar<br/>continues to lead the band every weekend, but Angelina is thinking of<br/>quitting to join the Guadalajara Philharmonic. She says she is going<br/>to be the next Latin Herbie Mann, with or without Omar.</p><p>I&apos;m not sure where the group first learned to tune their marimba to<br/>the Partch 43 tone scale. Rosa the guitarist found her axe in a<br/>dumpster outside Peteluma and quickly fell in love with the big<br/>chords made possible with the otonality. Omar just likes the chance<br/>to show off his embouchure, if you know what I mean.</p><p>I hope to post more recording of Omar, once I&apos;ve cleaned the<br/>tequila out of my Sony Minidisc recorder. %}</p><p>Prent Rodgers<br/>Mercer Island, WA<br/>The Milli Vanilli Capital of the Northwest</p></div><h3><a id=14310 href="#14310">ðŸ”—</a>Paul H.

What a group!  Amazing, too: I counted at least 24 band<br/>members in the group picture, yet they keep their music very tight,<br/>almost as if far fewer instruments were playing.</p><p>I think we should send the <a href="http://mp3.com">mp3.com</a> people down to Ajijic to get more<br/>recordings of this amazing blend of Mariachi and microtonal.

How can we be<br/>optimistic when at every turn these same tortured tribulations transpire<br/>without end?</p><p>Yet, I suppose, considering the beauty of the music coming out of<br/>Ajijic (that&apos;s pronounced &quot;ah-hee-heek&quot;, right Prent?), we should simply<br/>focus on the good, the lurking human desire to transcend.  Beyond this,<br/>we can always hope that Omar will decide to keep his embouchure under<br/>control, instead of seeking constantly for new instruments upon which to<br/>apply it.</p><p>JdL</p></div><h3><a id=14347 href="#14347">ðŸ”—</a>David J.
