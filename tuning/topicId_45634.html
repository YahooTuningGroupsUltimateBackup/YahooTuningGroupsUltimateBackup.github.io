His protege is Manfred Stahnke, my vote for the most prodigious microtonal composer in Germany (if not all of Europe).  Ligeti told me is he always searching for some kind of microtonal connection with science formulas.  He hoped I would be &quot;proud&quot; of some of his usage in the 2nd Violin Concerto (which I still haven&apos;t actually heard).</p><p>Ligeti is trying to come up with the quintessential microtonal contribution, while desperately trying to fulfill a load of commissions before his life expires.  (yes, he worries)</p><p>He does have a beautiful solo for harpsichord intended for quarter comma meantone.  And there is the trio for natural horn, violin, and ET piano.  But we all await a definitive microtonal statement.</p><p>best, Johnny Reinhard</p></div>
