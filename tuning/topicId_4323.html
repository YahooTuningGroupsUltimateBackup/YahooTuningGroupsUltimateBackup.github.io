DarthSynr is not to be found on AOL any longer.</p><p>I like to think that my music is in part a form of<br/>&quot;applied science fiction&quot; as well as a preser-<br/>vation of Just Intonation scales:<br/>&quot;The difference in sound between the two tuning types [Just Intonation<br/>&amp; Equal Temperament] might seem a subtle one. But the change from<br/>the variegated interval spacings and harmonies of ratio-based tunings<br/>to the uniformity of equal temperament was culturally and philosophical-<br/>ly significant. As western material culture moved into an age of mass pro-<br/>duction, the technology of interchangable parts was applied to the build-<br/>ing blocks of music as well.
