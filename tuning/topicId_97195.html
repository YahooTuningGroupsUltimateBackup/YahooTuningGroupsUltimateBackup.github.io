Classifying the MODMOS&apos;s of fractional-period<br/>scales is a bit over my head right now, so here they are in step form<br/>without recourse to the alterations made to the periodicity blocks.</p><p>12-equal is nearly ideal to tune for this, but I&apos;ll put this out in<br/>45-equal because it has 7-limit implications. 15-equal is no good,<br/>because the scale becomes improper. Replace every 4 with 1 and every 7<br/>with 2 to get the 12-equal version.</p><p>The .&apos;s are just to break things up and make it easier to read.</p><p>Starting with augmented[9] - 4 7 4 . 4 7 4 . 4 7 4</p><p>&quot;Major&quot; 9-note pentachordal scale - Augmented[9]#7<br/>Augmented[9] MODMOS view: 4 7 4 . 4 7 4 . 7 4 4<br/>Tetrachordally symmetric mode: 4 7 4 4 . 7 . 4 7 4 4<br/>&quot;Major&quot; mode: 7 4 4 4 . 7 . 4 4 7 4</p><p>The major mode has 4:5:6 chords lying 3/2 away from the root in both<br/>directions. A major 7 chord over the root, if transposed<br/>&quot;albitonically&quot; up and down the scale, will turn into a dominant 7<br/>chord with a raised 7th approximating 9/5 when it&apos;s lying on top of<br/>the &quot;V&quot; chord, which of course would no longer have the number V here.</p><p>&quot;Minor&quot; 9-note pentachordal scale - Augmented[9]b8<br/>Augmented[9] MODMOS view: 4 7 4 . 4 7 4 . 4 4 7<br/>Tetrachordally symmetric mode: 4 4 7 4 . 7 . 4 4 7 4<br/>&quot;Minor&quot; mode:  7 4 4 4 . 7 . 4 7 4 4</p><p>The minor chord has 10:12:15 chords lying 3/2 away from the root in<br/>both directions. Additionally, over the &quot;V&quot; chord there&apos;s a dominant 7<br/>chord with a raised 7th again approximating 9/5.</p><p>These seem very useful in the sense that they might be used to set up<br/>&quot;xenharmonic&quot; 5-limit tonal structures that extend on the diatonic one<br/>and also have remained buried within 12-tet, as did 22-equal&apos;s. Has<br/>anyone explored these before? Might there be some interesting subgroup<br/>one could set up over this to bring higher-limit harmonies into the<br/>fold?</p><p>-Mike</p></div>
