I have a concern which I&apos;m going to have a go at answering myself:</p><p>I&apos;ve noticed on this list that most posts can be divided into roughly two topics: a) variations on 12-tone scales, and b) non-12-tone scales.</p><p>What concerns me slightly is the use of &quot;cents&quot; in both cases to describe scale intervals. It seems to me that a) cents only really fit 12-tone scales, and b) cents are a linear &quot;difference&quot; of what is actually a geometric relationship - they don&apos;t scale correctly for higher octave divisions.</p><p>I&apos;ve been doing basic scale calculations with a spreadsheet, and cents don&apos;t seem to be a useful concept in that context. I found that a simple error percentage calculation was a better guide to how consonant intervals sound (or don&apos;t). I wrote a long article on this topic, with several tables, but thought better of inflicting it on the list - this is the version that cuts to the chase!</p><p>The table below compares the perfect fifth (3/2) to the &quot;fret positions&quot; calculated under 12ET (7), 19ET (11) and 22ET (13), using two different error measurements: cents difference, or % error. For 19ET and 22ET, I&apos;ve chosen to divide the octave up into 1900 and 2200 respectively, which makes the numbers easier to compare by eye, but not affecting the result.</p><p>&quot;dec.ratio&quot; is the ET ratio  calculated using 2^(n/12), while &quot;Rcents&quot; is 3/2 coverted to cents using log2(3/2) and multiplied by 1200, 1900 and 2200 as appropriate. %diff is the error ratio between dec.ratio and 3/2 (1.5) .</p><p>Scale&#x9;ETcents  Rcents&#x9; c.err&#x9;dec.rat  %diff&#x9;330Hz beat<br/>12ET&#x9;700&#x9; 701.96&#x9;  1.96&#x9;1.4983&#x9;-0.113%&#x9;0.372Hz<br/>19ET&#x9;1100&#x9;1111.43&#x9; 11.43&#x9;1.4938&#x9;-0.416%&#x9;1.373Hz<br/>22ET&#x9;1300&#x9;1286.92 -13.08&#x9;1.5062&#x9; 0.413%&#x9;1.363Hz</p><p>By the cents measurement, 22ET looks worse than 19ET, while using the % error measurement, it&apos;s marginally better. If we take beat frequency between the ideal and the actual as a measure of fit, the beat frequencies follow the %diff ratios (19ET has approx 4 times the beat frequency as 12ET). I&apos;ve tried generating these intervals using CoolEdit, and as best as I can measure on screen and hear the relationship holds true in practice.</p><p>So, that&apos;s my point - cents is of use in a historical context and with primitive* instruments, but it doesn&apos;t help when searching for the lost chord..! 8{</p><p>Cheers,</p><p>Brian Thomson, London UK<br/><a href="mailto:bnt@email.com">bnt@email.com</a></p><p>* You know what I mean, right?<br/>-----------------------------------------------<br/>FREE!

Ellis)<br/>has stuck us with only one type of cent -- that of<br/>which there are 1200 in a 2:1 octave. 19-tET has steps of<br/>63.16 cents, and 22-tET has steps of 54.55 cents. The 3:2<br/>(&quot;fifth&quot;) is 7.22 cents flat in 19-tET, and 7.14 cents sharp<br/>in 22-tET.</p></div>
