What I wonder is if there is any literature or studies into the perception of intonation and the aural development of the listener.</p><p>On this list a while ago there were some posts with Ravel&apos;s Pavane in different EDOs, and the listener was expected to comment on the effects. At the time i think id had something to do with enharmonics, etc.</p><p>anyhow, I&apos;ve been roped in to give some advice, and I thought - the kind members of the tuning list might have something in mind.</p><p>Mark</p></div>
