It&apos;s<br/>even possible to get a stretched 12-tET version.  I&apos;m using the curve<br/>that Monz quoted in</p><p>   <a href="/tuning/topicId_13830.html#13830">/tuning/topicId_13830.html#13830</a></p><p>And that Allan Myhara cleverly turned into a simple expression in</p><p>   <a href="/tuning/topicId_13830.html#13879">/tuning/topicId_13830.html#13879</a></p><p>Right around middle C, there&apos;s very little stretch per octave, but at<br/>both extremes the change gets steeply intense.  From the lowest to the<br/>highest note, there is a full 50 cents of stretch.</p><p>Two list members sent me piano sequences - thanks, guys!!  I&apos;ll be<br/>returning stretched and tuned versions, and maybe even a<br/>double-stretched and negatively stretched version for listening.  I&apos;m<br/>still doing sanity checks on the output, but so far it seems to be<br/>working correctly.</p><p>What does it sound like?  To my ear, using my rather rough piano voice,<br/>about like it did before stretch!  Even a file I made up with C&apos;s all<br/>up and down the line sounds quite alike to me on first hearing.  I&apos;m<br/>going to make a file with the notes arpeggiated and see if that makes it<br/>clearer.  And/or, try another piano voice.</p><p>One very strange thing is happening to the files I&apos;ve run through so<br/>far: the overall tuning range tends to move downward rather than being<br/>more extreme.  In other words, high and low notes tend to be the ones<br/>that are tuned downward from 12-tET; notes in the middle of the keyboard<br/>tend to be tuned upward from 12-tET.  This could be a bug, though my<br/>spot checks look ok.  Or it could be an anomaly in the fairly small<br/>sample set.  It DOESN&apos;T seem to be that the pieces have only low notes<br/>in them.</p><p>Method note: when the piece is tuned, it is tuned as before, without<br/>regard to stretch (or even the knowledge of what octave each pitch<br/>degree resides in).  Then stretch is added in at the last moment, with<br/>knowledge of actual pitch locations.  I did have to modify the channel<br/>assignment logic so that notes of the same pitch class can&apos;t share a<br/>channel unless the pitch is IDENTICAL (same octave).  That makes<br/>channels scarcer than ever!  But for solo piano, it should usually work.</p><p>JdL</p></div><h3><a id=23792 href="#23792">ðŸ”—</a>Paul Erlich &#x3C;paul@stretch-music.com&#x3E;</h3><span>5/25/2001 9:54:46 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In tuning@y..., &quot;John A. deLaubenfels&quot; &lt;jdl@a...&gt; wrote:</p><p>&gt; One very strange thing is happening to the files I&apos;ve run through so<br/>&gt; far: the overall tuning range tends to move downward rather than<br/>being<br/>&gt; more extreme.
