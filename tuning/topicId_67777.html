Hexanies and<br/>eikosanies are JI, and 11 explores a system of subgroup-type harmony,<br/>in effect, I think. 7 strikes me as a boring alternative to the<br/>diatonic scale, and 13 is weird.</p><p>Yes of course, I meant them as an example of a wide variety of different<br/>scales that need a completely different approach. Also indeed<br/>various traditional musics like Indian music.</p><p>Yes I agree that 13 is pretty weird, and seems to work better with<br/>some timbres than with others, more timbre dependent than<br/>many tunings. I am fond of 7-et myself, and think perhaps<br/>it is one of those where you can approach it with a different<br/>mind set and then maybe it will work .</p><p>&gt; 53 is a schismatic system and not suitable for common practice music.<br/>It would be great for medieval music, though.</p><p>Rightio, thanks for the correction.</p><p>&gt; &gt; So anyway, yes I think 17-et is a very lyrical tuning (amongst<br/>others) and some time it would be nice to really explore it and try<br/>and bring out what I feel seems to come across when improvising in it.</p><p>&gt; Is it lyrical in a sense 19, say, isn&apos;t? They don&apos;t sound the same,<br/>certainly.</p><p>Yes I&apos;d say so, I don&apos;t want to say anyone else is wrong if<br/>they think it is the other way around or whatever. The small<br/>semitone of just the right size may be partly to do with it as<br/>George says in his paper. Maybe it depends on how one feels<br/>about that or something, I&apos;m not very analytical about such<br/>things myself so can&apos;t answer easily if asked what<br/>it is that makes it feel so lyrical.</p><p>It is lyrical in a tender soaring way I feel.<br/>Other tunings are lyrical in their own ways.</p><p>If this is right, and there is anything to this<br/>feeling of lyricism to the tuning that  some<br/>17-et enthusiasts have, maybe someone<br/>some day  will be inspired to write something<br/>really overwhelmingly lyrical in 17-et and then<br/>we will all hear what its real potential is.</p><p>I&apos;m  sure there are lots of tunings that await<br/>appropriate pieces to be written for them before<br/>we can really appreciate their true potential<br/>:-).</p><p>Robert</p></div><h3><a id=67778 href="#67778">ðŸ”—</a>Gene Ward Smith &#x3C;genewardsmith@coolgoose.com&#x3E;</h3><span>10/24/2006 2:04:43 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;Robert walker&quot; &lt;robertwalker@...&gt; wrote:</p><p>&gt; I&apos;m  sure there are lots of tunings that await<br/>&gt; appropriate pieces to be written for them before<br/>&gt; we can really appreciate their true potential<br/>&gt; :-).</p><p>Speaking of 17 note scales, the convex closure of the 7-limit dimond in<br/>the breed plane, tuned to 130-et, is getting a tryout in my next piece,<br/>along with various other scales. Quite an interesting scale, though the<br/>step sizes are a long way from being equal.</p></div>
