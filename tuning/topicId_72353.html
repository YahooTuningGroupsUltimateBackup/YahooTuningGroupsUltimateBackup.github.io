As I<br/>said, the deadline for announcing intent to write for the concert was<br/>June 22nd.</p><p>I have the following people:</p><p>myself<br/>Chris Bailey<br/>Joel Mandelbaum<br/>Jacob Barton<br/>Tim Polachek<br/>Gene Ward Smith<br/>Carl Lumma</p><p>I know there were a handful of others, and I forget his name, but a<br/>Russian guy sent me a piece....</p><p>So, anyway, can you all finalize your intent with me? If you don&apos;t<br/>have my personal email, don&apos;t use the Yahoo! one, I&apos;ll never checkit...instead, use my web interface at<br/><a href="http://www.akjmusic.com/contact.html---that">http://www.akjmusic.com/contact.html---that</a> way you&apos;ll get through my<br/>spam firewall and potentially be whitelisted.</p><p>And remember, the deadline to receive a composition (in PDF please) is<br/>August 15th. This does not imply a guaranteed performance----if you<br/>want to guarantee a performance, first off, write a great piece,<br/>secondly, make it on the easier side, as I have 3 pianists currently,<br/>am looking for more, do not a lot of money yet, and a rehearsal time<br/>of about a month or so.</p><p>Thanks,<br/>Aaron.</p></div>
