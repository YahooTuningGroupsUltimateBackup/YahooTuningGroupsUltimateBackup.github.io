Also those musical languages that are speech based are not in anyway come out toward 12 or 5 limit. Look at<br/>your balophones scales in africa. Here it is interested to note that upper octaves do not correspond with the lower<br/>octaves mainly because as a person get excited his intonations raised and the interval size change. You find the same<br/>thing on these balaphones where notes in lower octaves are different than ones in lower. Also let us also notice that<br/>those languages which have tonal elements, their choices are not either 5 limit or ant 12 tone matrix. Both of these<br/>are more the result of working with sine tones. aAlso the recognition of &quot;consonance&quot; is not universal unless you ask<br/>the people to pick intervals that don&apos;t beat. which of course you will get the result you want. I have never heard<br/>anyone talk in 5 limit ofr in 12 ET.</p><p>-- -Kraig Grady<br/>North American Embassy of Anaphoria Island<br/> <a href="http://www.anaphoria.com">http://www.anaphoria.com</a><br/>The Wandering Medicine Show<br/> KXLU 88.9 FM WED 8-9PM PST</p></div><h3><a id=46370 href="#46370">ðŸ”—</a>Graham Breed &#x3C;graham@microtonal.co.uk&#x3E;</h3><span>8/11/2003 6:26:51 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>kraig grady wrote:</p><p>&gt; We forget from the offset that Partch could not duplicate speech in 12 at all and had to go toward something closer<br/>&gt; to 41.
