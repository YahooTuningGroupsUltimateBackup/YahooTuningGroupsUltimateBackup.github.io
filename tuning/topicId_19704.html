Check to see if the file name has spaces in it, if so<br/>replace them by underlines. Then note down the url.</p><p>Now go to the database area, and the FAQ_tree database.</p><p>Fill in all the fields.</p><p>First one is the Destination folder in the url tree</p><p>- this means the folder you see in the tree control - the one<br/>you want to add your entry into.</p><p>This isn&apos;t a _real_ folder, it only means anything in the context<br/>of the tree control, as a way of organising the faq tree.</p><p>---------------------------------------------------------<br/>It isn&apos;t the folder you put it in in the files area, nor is it<br/>the actual destination folder in the web site.</p><p>That&apos;s to make it possible to move entries around in the tree<br/>and then remake the database, without disturbing the urls of<br/>the files.</p><p>You don&apos;t need to know why it can work (makes me a bit dizzy to<br/>to kind of think about it too) just that it is possible.</p><p>But basically, the thing that keeps the tree together as a tree<br/>is the database, and particularly, the first Folder field.</p><p>This is the sort of thing programs are particularly good at,<br/>for once.</p><p>Robert</p></div>
