I once was listening to mysterious mountain on the radio at<br/>&gt; &gt; work and a co-worker came in and started talking about how this reminded him of when he lived<br/>&gt; &gt; on Mt. Shasta. Neither of us knew the piece and were impressed when we heard the title at the<br/>&gt; &gt; end. but you are the only one who has mentioned him on this list (glad you did).<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Alan Hovhaness.  There, I&apos;ve mentioned him, too.  I first met Hovhaness<br/>&gt; in Detroit of all places when I was about 15 years old.  I had gone to<br/>&gt; the symphony all by myself and asked Hovhaness for his autograph outside<br/>&gt; the concert hall.  He was very startled that someone so young would be<br/>&gt; &quot;stalking&quot; him and asking for an autograph.  I was also amazed at the<br/>&gt; fact that he was ALWAYS composing, even in a rehearsal, which is what I<br/>&gt; happened to see.<br/>&gt; __________ ____ ___ _ _<br/>&gt; Joseph Pehrson<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;</p><p>-- Kraig Grady<br/>North American Embassy of Anaphoria island<br/><a href="http://www.anaphoria.com">www.anaphoria.com</a></p></div>
