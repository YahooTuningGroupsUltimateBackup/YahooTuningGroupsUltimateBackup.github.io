Which one did you use?</p><p>Well, what I did was this. I tuned 4 fifths, starting with c: c-g-d-a-e. I<br/>checked the third c-e to make sure it was a little bigger than pure but<br/>considerably smaller than in ET; then I tuned fifths mostly pure but if<br/>anything a little small e-b-f#-c#-g# and c-f-bb-eb; I checked the fifth<br/>g#-eb to make sure it was usable. And as I practiced the exact program I<br/>moved notes hither and yon as it seemed to me some note would have sounded<br/>better in an important place in one piece or another. Until something had<br/>evolved that worked quite nicely with what I was playing on that program.</p><p>If I had needed to do any major tuning instead of just a couple of unisons<br/>during intermission, I would have used the Werckmeister III setting on my<br/>Sanderson Accutuner. It would have been fine, and pretty similar to what<br/>it was at.</p><p>Judy</p></div>
