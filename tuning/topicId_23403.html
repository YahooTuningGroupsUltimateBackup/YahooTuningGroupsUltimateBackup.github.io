You obviously can&apos;t discuss the particulars of<br/>tunings themselves without involving math.  You can&apos;t quantify<br/>a specific tuning without math.  However, you can invent and<br/>explore tunings, and discuss how you apply tunings to music, without<br/>more than incidental references to the most rudimentary math, not<br/>counting lists of ratios and cents and scale degrees.  That&apos;s what the<br/>Practicalmicro list (I still think &quot;Applied&quot; would be more accurate<br/>than &quot;Practical&quot;) is all about.</p><p>David J.
