It is a model for my through composed<br/>works that explore microtones especially the string quartet White.</p><p>Five Movements starts out by exploring the immediate crevices around<br/>one pitch in movement one. Movement 2 expands that by exploring the<br/>beat relationships produced when harmonics of that same pitch are<br/>produced on different strings.  In movement 3 the microtonality is<br/>incidental - characteristic of the sound but not the structure,<br/>movement 4 is pretty much diatonic, and movement 5 takes that very<br/>focused beam of the first movement and diffuses it into a kind of<br/>undulating cloud - so here again the microtones are more coloristic<br/>than formal.&quot;</p><p>Dan</p></div>
