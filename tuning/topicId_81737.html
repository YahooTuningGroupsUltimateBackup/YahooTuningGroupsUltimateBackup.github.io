And I get the strong<br/>impression that trying to think of 7-limit JI in 5-limit JI terms is<br/>far from optimal in the same way using 3-limit terms for 5-limit JI is.</p><p>******************************<br/>   So, just as a starter&apos;s guide, what are some good 7-limit JI chords<br/>and what&apos;s a good way of defining how consonant a 7-limit JI chord is<br/>(beside just memorizing them)?</p><p>  And, in your opinion, what are some of the best examples of 7-limit<br/>JI far as compositions I can listen to (used in a way where it&apos;s NOT<br/>trying to emulate 5-limit intervals/chords)?<br/>-------------------------------------------</p><p>  I also think...7-limit JI may be a great thing for myself and others<br/>to benchmark new scales we create against.  It seems to me 7-limit,<br/>when used well, can provide near 5-limit consonance with more possible<br/>chords and flexibility...thus providing more of a challenge to new<br/>non-JI systems.</p><p>***********************************<br/>  I will also agree 7-limit is fairly &quot;futuristic&quot; as virtually all<br/>the tuning systems I have seen are diatonic and seem to be based on<br/>emulating 5-limit JI intervals.<br/>  So before I partly write-off 7-limit JI as a &quot;slightly more flexible<br/>version of 5-limit&quot; I would like to see what it can do.</p><p>-Michael</p></div><h3><a id=81738 href="#81738">ðŸ”—</a>Torsten Anders &#x3C;torsten.anders@...&#x3E;</h3><span>2/23/2009 3:35:50 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Dear Michael,</p><p>On Feb 23, 2009, at 10:46 PM, djtrancendance wrote:<br/>&gt; So, just as a starter&apos;s guide, what are some good 7-limit JI chords</p><p>Below is a list of common 7-limit chords which I like particularly.
