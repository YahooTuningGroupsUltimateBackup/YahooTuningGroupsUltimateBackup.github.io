My listening tests were<br/>somewhat limited by the 12 note span of the pads on my soundmodule/drum machine<br/>[Ensoniq ASR-X]. The results so far were that out of the three scales I tried<br/>[my own, Daves proposal and Pauls proposal]. Dave&apos;s one had most variety with<br/>lot&apos;s of near just intervals and slow beating. I quite liked this effect. Pauls<br/>scale seemed good for modulation and very even which I liked also. My own scale<br/>seemed very unasuming almost not there. Anyway it was not the greatest test.</p><p>But it has influenced my own theories on scales a bit. I think that every melody<br/>whether just or tempered or whatever seems to fit best to a certain genetic blue<br/>print and that the whole can be deduced somewhat from the part. Erv Wilson has<br/>talked about this sort of idea and also I think Yasser had a similar theory re:<br/>the expansion of tonal systems.</p><p>I am interested in reading his book now !</p><p>I&apos;ll use my keyboard and do it properly on the weekend.</p><p>Justin White</p></div><h3><a id=27502 href="#27502">ðŸ”—</a>Dave Keenan &#x3C;D.KEENAN@UQ.NET.AU&#x3E;</h3><span>8/27/2001 11:44:53 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In tuning@y..., &quot;Paul Erlich&quot; &lt;paul@s...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt; None of the other proposals by Dave Keenan will have these<br/>properties.</p><p>And none of the other proposals (so far) by Dave Keenan have errors as<br/>large as 4.3 cents, or as many as 41 frets for a 29 note scale.</p><p>Here&apos;s my own fretting proposal for the 29 note 9-limit schismic MOS<br/>(with 4.3c errors).

From statistical theory, crudely<br/>used, if the guitar has typical errors (rms or standard deviation) of<br/>3 cents and the tuning has typical errors (rms or standard deviation)<br/>of 1 cent then the result will be a typical error of sqrt(3^2 + 1^2) =<br/>3.2 cents.</p><p>So a microtemperament with 1c rms (prob 3c max) errors would only add<br/>about 0.2c to the total error for the guitar.</p><p>&gt; I guess I agree with Paul that the main benefits of temperament are<br/>modulation,<br/>&gt; a simplified way of mastering the tonal universe.

But that takes skill, and even assuming the skill is<br/>aquired, it takes _time_. i.e. the notes must be sustained long enough<br/>to hear at least a cycle of the slowest beat you intend to cancel.</p><p>And Carl, this applies as much to FFT&apos;s as it does to human hearing.<br/>The uncertainty principle says that your frequency resolution is the<br/>inverse of the time over which you sample. You want 0.1 Hz resolution,<br/>you need a 10 second sample. A 0.1 Hz change represents a 1 cent<br/>change at 173 Hz, or a 0.1 c change at 1730 Hz, etc.</p><p>1730 Hz is kind of a magic number that can be worth remembering. It&apos;s<br/>where a _small_ change in cents (say &lt; 20) corresponds to about the<br/>same number of hertz.
