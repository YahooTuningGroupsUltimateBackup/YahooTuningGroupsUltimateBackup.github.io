For example, let&apos;s say that the monzo (or &quot;PSC&quot; as I was calling it earlier) is [-11 2 7 -3]. From this I should find that it&apos;s actually the distance between (12/5)^7 and (54/7)^3. Whatever method I choose to compare these intervals, this suggests the approximate size of the generator and says that I use 3 of them for approximating 12/5 and 7 for approximating 54/7. Next, I&apos;ll find such octave equivalents or octave inversions of these two which are as low in the harmonic series as possible, which is actually 5/3 and 27/7, respectively. If there were a piece of code doing it, these should be returned among the &quot;output values&quot; for the end user because we&apos;re no longer approximating 3/1 and 5/1. Finally, I&apos;ll give the mapping for the new approximants, including the octave, which is [(1 0) (2 -3) (1 -7)].</p><p>Now the thing is that I know what the results should be for some ratios because of other occasions but I&apos;m not sure how I should do this for an unfamiliar ratio.</p><p>Another example is the earlier discussed [10 5 8 -13] which actually compares (12/7)^13 to (12/5)^8. So this time, the target approximants are 5/3 and 7/3 and the full mapping is [(1 0) (2 -13) (2 -8)].</p><p>Obviously, if the GCD of the 3-5-7 exponents is not 1, then we have to split the octave -- but that&apos;s another story.</p><p>If you have an idea how this could be applied to other ratios, I welcome any suggestions.</p><p>Thanks in advance.</p><p>Petr</p></div><h3>genewardsmith &#x3C;genewardsmith@...&#x3E;</h3><span>6/23/2011 11:53:33 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, Petr Pa&angst;Â™&Atilde;&shy;zek &lt;petrparizek2000@...&gt; wrote:<br/>Whatever method I choose to compare these<br/>&gt; intervals, this suggests the approximate size of the generator and says that<br/>&gt; I use 3 of them for approximating 12/5 and 7 for approximating 54/7.</p><p>An easier approach, it seems to me, is to first find the normal val list, which has corresponding generators 2, 3 and 75/56.

The thing which was stopping me and which you suggested was to treat m separately and differently from p and n. So if I add one more symbol to the ones you assigned and label it &quot;o&quot;, then I have [-11o 2m 7p -3n] and I&apos;ll break it into two sets of 4 numbers. One will have a zero in place of p and n will be unchanged, the other will have zero in place of n and p will be unchanged, and both o and m will be equal to the unchanged n or p multiplied by an integer of the lowest possible absolute value (although I&apos;m not sure how I would say to a computer to find the lowest(abs) possible multiplier here). This means:<br/>[-11 2 7 -3] = [-14 -7 7 0] + [3 9 0 -3]<br/>Voila, that&apos;s exactly what we were looking for. :-)</p><p>Similarly, if we start with [10o 5m 8p -13n], we have:<br/>[10 5 8 -13] = [-16 -8 8 0] + [26 13 0 -13]</p><p>Now let me tell you a sweet secret. Although I wasn&apos;t aware that it could work in this case, it&apos;s actually exactly the same procedure I&apos;ve been using for finding 5-limit 2D temperaments. For example, the version with the lowest(abs) multipliers for amity is:<br/>[9 -13 5] = [39 -13 0] + [-30 0 5]</p><p>Wow, I&apos;m so happy that we&apos;ve nailed it down in the end ... Now I suspect that there are some interesting 2D tunings hidden in these 7-limit factors. I&apos;m only afraid it would take me whole days to get to them because finding the lowest multipliers by hand is terribly slow, or at least when I&apos;m doing it -- but I&apos;ve done it many times already so I&apos;ll do it a few times more --  at least I&apos;ll refresh my math skills that way.and then, what comes next ...

The algorithm tries to find the approximated ratios used in a 2D temperament with a given vanishing interval. For 5-limit 2D temperaments, they are 3/1 and 5/1. However, if you want to find a 2D tuning tempering out 703125/702464, then you have to approximate some other ratios.

That means you started with 3 ratios, one of which you use as the period and the 2 others are the target approximated ratios. So there are one more non-period approximated ratios than there are generators -- and for 5-limit temperaments, for example, they are 3/1 and 5/1, no matter how one particular temperament maps them in terms of periods and generators.</p><p>Now, if you want to use target approximated ratios of 3/1 and 5/1 within a 7-limit system and still get a 2D result, you then have to temper out two commas. But this is not what I&apos;m trying to do here. In fact, I&apos;m doing the opposite of what would normally be the goal. To give you an example, in the more &quot;normal&quot; case, I could find a &quot;3-less&quot; 2D temperament by first deciding that the period (or the equivalence interval, to be precise) should be 2/1, then deciding that the target approximated factors should be 5/1 and 7/1, and finally tempering out one interval using these &quot;input data&quot; as my starting point (which obviously offers me commas like 50/49 or 3136/3125 or that sort of thing). So in that case, I first had three requirements: &quot;Use 2/1 as the equivalence interval, use 5/1 as one approximant, use 7/1 as another approximant&quot;; and then I found a 2D temperament based on these three.</p><p>However, now let&apos;s suppose we have not three but two starting requirements: &quot;Use 2/1 as the equivalence interval, find a 2D tuning which tempers out such and such a comma&quot;. If the vanishing interval contains three primes and one of them is two, then the procedure is obvious (for example, when tempering out 3136/3125, 2 generators approximate 5/4 and 5 generators approximate 7/4). However, what if it&apos;s something like 225/224, which contains 4 different primes (which would suggest to use 3 target approximants instead of 2, those being 3/1, 5/1, 7/1), and you still want a 2D temperament? Well, you have basically three options to choose from. #1: You can temper out two commas at a time, which makes it perfectly possible to start with 3 target approximated factors instead of 2. #2: You can make a non-octave temperament that would use a tempered 5/4 as the generator and a tempered 4/3 or 5/3 as the period (which is what I&apos;ve done in my little &quot;Non-octave marvel&quot; study last year). #3: You can spot that 225/224 is (8/7)^1 / (16/15)^2; so you can happily use an octave as the period and a tempered minor second as the generator, two of which make a tempered 8/7. Note that in this third example, we&apos;re approximating 16/15 without actually including 3/2 or 5/4. That means that our target approximated odd factors now are 15/1 and 7/1 (I&apos;m stripping the 2 out because that&apos;s our period). And this &quot;option #3&quot; is what I&apos;m thinking of here. Of course, if you wish to approximate 3/1 or 5/1, you can add another generator (let&apos;s say 5/4) and you end up with marvel. This means you would then need to stack at least two of these &quot;secondary generators&quot; to get a 5-limit triad -- i.e. if the primary generator is 16/15 and the secondary generator  is 5/4, then 5/3 is mapped to &quot;1, 2&quot; in terms of their counts. If you favor 5-limit intervals over 7-limit ones, you can also get marvel by using generators of, for example, 3/1 and 5/1. The downside of this version may be that you need more generators for some 7-limit intervals but that&apos;s another story.</p><p>Let&apos;s take another example: 126/125. If I want this to vanish in a 2D system, I can either temper it out together with something else; or I can find a non-octave temperament which does the job; or I can spot that it&apos;s actually (6/5)^3 / (12/7)^1 and temper it out solely in terms of the two approximated intervals, 6/5 and 12/7, keep the 2/1 octave and still have it 2D. This means, of course, that triads like 3:5:7 would be possible in such a temperament but something like 3/1 wouldn&apos;t. Do we want to have a 3/1 there as well, yes? Okay, we&apos;ll add another generator and that gives us starling. Again, if you use generators of 3/1 and 5/1 instead, you&apos;ll need more of them for 7-limit intervals -- and I personally don&apos;t like this version of starling very much as it&apos;s clearly more complex than if one generator is a minor third.</p><p>And now the final revealing comes -- if we temper out both 225/224 and 126/125, we get 7-limit meantone and the aforementioned 3136/3125 vanishes as well. If we look at it in terms of the three commas, we find that we need 5 generators for 16/15, 3 generators for 6/5, and -4 generators for 5/4. This means that 7-limit meantone requires 5 times more generators than if we temper out 225/224 by itself, as long as we&apos;re only interested in 15/1 and 7/1, then it requires 3 times  more generators than if we temper out 126/125 by itself, as long as we&apos;re only interested in 5/3 and 7/3, and it requires 2 times more generators than if we temper out 3136/3125 by itself, as long as we&apos;re only interested in 5/1 and 7/1. But it&apos;s perfectly okay as it can approximate 3/1, 5/1, and 7/1 at the same time. OTOH, if we do care about the non-prime factors without explicitly requiring the prime ones, we can temper out only one of the commas and sometimes even get a less complex temperament.</p><p>Petr</p></div><h3>Mike Battaglia &#x3C;battaglia01@...&#x3E;</h3><span>6/25/2011 6:11:39 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>On Fri, Jun 24, 2011 at 9:24 PM, genewardsmith<br/>&lt;genewardsmith@...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; --- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, Mike Battaglia &lt;battaglia01@...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt; However, if you want to find a 2D tuning tempering out<br/>&gt; &gt; 703125/702464, then you have to approximate some other ratios.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; Why can&apos;t you still treat the generators as 3/1 and 5/1?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Because you won&apos;t get all of the 7-limit intervals.</p><p>Oh, duh.

Well, OK, maybe not every<br/>question, but this is a major piece of it. I take back any<br/>disagreement I had with Petr about where tonality comes from. I&apos;ve<br/>been playing with 245/243-tempered 1/1-9/7-5/3 chords all night, and<br/>1/1-6/5-36/25-7/4 chords as well, and it&apos;s tripping me out.</p><p>Mentally, we seem to build these little harmonic routes from 1/1 to<br/>whatever note you hit, which could quite literally be said to be<br/>higher-dimensional JI interval &quot;functions.&quot; When two of these<br/>functions merge - like a 7/4 up from 1/1, or also three 6/5&apos;s up - the<br/>&quot;quality&quot; of the note somehow ends up being a mixture of the two<br/>functions and merges into something new. For me, synesthetically, the<br/>color that I see ends up being very literally a mixture of the two<br/>colors of the original notes before merging. For example, in mavila,<br/>5/2 is also 4/3 * 4/3 * 4/3 - the former is black, and the latter is<br/>orange, and the result is like some kind of dark blood-orange color.<br/>This is crazy and I have to keep pinching myself to make sure I&apos;m<br/>still alive, but it appears to be working.</p><p>For those who haven&apos;t ever experienced any degree of sound-color<br/>synesthesia, more generally I&apos;m talking about what appears to be<br/>&quot;chroma&quot; formation now.

Or 875/864 tempered 1/1-6/5-36/25-7/4 chords which are<br/>&gt; diminished, yet partly otonal and &quot;rooted&quot; at the same time, profoundly<br/>&gt; transforming the experience of a diminished chord into something new and<br/>&gt; exciting and transcendent. It&apos;s a rather pleasant experience to be having.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Most importantly, to me, it seems to suggest something like proto-tonality,<br/>&gt; where I can start to hear more complex notes in sensi[8] as being compound<br/>&gt; intervals reachable by simpler consonances like 9/7 and 5/3, kind of how I<br/>&gt; hear the meantone major sevenths as being reachable by fifth+third. (This<br/>&gt; assumes your ear is trained enough to hear 9/7 as not just a sharp 5/4). So<br/>&gt; I feel like this is only one step away from a full-blown tonal heirarchy,<br/>&gt; and now I can relate a lot more to Petr&apos;s work from a month ago.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; So I hope you might find this information useful enough to mathematically<br/>&gt; generalize, which is why I mentioned you.</p><p>To me, this feeling you describe has always been a major part of &quot;the point of temperament&quot;.

Once you get used to the sharp fifths, it&apos;s one of<br/>the most xenharmonic sounds possible.</p><p>Try it in 13-equal, just play the 738 cent circle of fifths. Three of<br/>them puts you at 9/5, and four of them puts you at 11/8<br/>(octave-equivalent), five gets you to 17/16, six gets you to 13/8.<br/>It&apos;s just insane.

How did you come to realize<br/>&gt; that?</p><p>I see. That&apos;s quite a long story but I&apos;ll try to make it shorter.</p><p>The first new &quot;recognition&quot; occurred to me around February 2006 when I managed to get some sort of &quot;systematic understanding&quot; of the non-octave temperament where 245/243 vanishes. Therefore, I was finally able to grasp why the so-called &quot;BP diatonic&quot; was said to have 9 steps to a 3/1 and why a &quot;BP chromatic&quot; was said to have 13 steps and so on. I gradually learned to understand the concept of non-octave non-equal temperaments when I later examined the one whose period was 4/1 and whose generator was the 9th root of 32/5 -- or, in the weirdest case, the one whose period was 9/5 and whose generator was an almost 9/7 so that 2430/2401 went tempered out. (Unfortunately, I never had a chance to try them out in real-time.) For finding all of these, I was using the method described in my previous message.</p><p>Then, a major shift in my thinking came in June the same year, when I essentially rediscovered semisixths and hanson almost by accident. That made me think: &quot;Oh my goodness, now all those 3/2s and 5/4s have totaly different musical meanings than what we&apos;re used to, this is just twisted.&quot; Maybe I wouldn&apos;t arrive at that conclusion if I hadn&apos;t been playing in real-time that moment, who knows? Anyway, the way I first arrived at semisixths also influenced my understanding a lot -- as I was interested in BP those days, I first made a scale using a period of 3/1 and I realized that I could actually get octaves in there if the generator were slightly wider than my preferred choice. Then I thought: &quot;What about reducing this to 2/1 rather than 3/1?&quot; And there I had it.</p><p>Later, I found that I could actually get a temperament just by tempering out a particular comma -- like, for example, starting with a monzo like &quot;9 -13 5&quot; and turning it into a pair of monzos like &quot;39 -13 0&quot; and &quot;-30 0 5&quot;, which gives me some rough notion about a possible generator and also tells me something about the mapping. That changed my understanding of the entire topic of 2D temperaments an awful lot because I finally started to be aware of not only the melodic properties of a particular tuning but also the harmonic ones.</p><p>Finally, when I got involved into the matter of comma pumps to an unexpectedly large extent, all of my previous conclusions about completely new harmonic systems seemed to me to be supported once again -- even in situations when I first thought that generator distances wouldn&apos;t play such a big role; and in the end they did. It&apos;s not easy to say in words, one just has to play around with it and ake a few pieces with it.</p><p>&gt; By &quot;codimension&quot; I meant the number of commas being tempered out. For<br/>&gt; meantone, porcupine, negri, etc, there&apos;s only one fundamental tempered<br/>&gt; relationship you have to learn, as well as all of its implications.<br/>&gt; But in 11-limit Orwell, for example, there&apos;s four fundamental tempered<br/>&gt; relationships you have to learn, and all of the implications just run<br/>&gt; right on top of one another. Do you think it matters? I thought so at<br/>&gt; first, but now I&apos;m not sure it does.</p><p>You can never say that it *is* or that it *isn&apos;t* important; it depends on whether you care or not. For example, is quarter-comma meantone a 5-limit temperament? Or is it a 7-limit temperament? Or is it an 11-limit temperament, for that matter? Or is it a 3136/3125 temperament with an added approximation of 3/2?</p><p>BTW: Why should there be 4 basic relationships for an 11-limit temperament?</p><p>Petr</p></div><h3>martinsj013 &#x3C;martinsj@...&#x3E;</h3><span>9/16/2011 3:07:31 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, Mike Battaglia &lt;battaglia01@...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt; [tempered 1/1 - 9/7 - 5/3 with lower and upper intervals equal]<br/>&gt; [8- or 11- note MOS]<br/>&gt; This chord has 245/243 vanish, and is a canonical chord in sensi<br/>&gt; temperament.</p><p>Mike,<br/>If you&apos;re interested, I&apos;ve uploaded a contour map of 3HE near this triad, see:<br/><a href="http://launch.groups.yahoo.com/group/tuning/files/g4c5c1M.png">http://launch.groups.yahoo.com/group/tuning/files/g4c5c1M.png</a></p><p>Some rational triads are labelled, also some other points needing explanation (my lazy programming means that only integers are accepted in the labels right now):</p><p>3:0:5 - actually 3:sqrt(15):5 (lower=upper=sqrt(5/3))<br/>0:5:13 - actually lower=upper=2^(5/13)<br/>0:4:13 - actually lower=upper=2^(4/13)<br/>0:13:13 - actually lower=upper=457.9cents, from my post.</p><p>My 457.9cents (ratio (sqrt(13)-1)/2) was chosen because it is on a &quot;channel&quot; of comparatively low 3HE.</p><p>&gt; The sLssLsLs mode is great because it&apos;s also &quot;tonal&quot; - has a tritone<br/>&gt; that resolves outward to 1/1-9/7-5/3.
