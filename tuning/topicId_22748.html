With that in mind, ALL lists evolve, just as the tuning list<br/>has. It should not be unexpected that other groups propogate when<br/>interests diverge.</p><p>Lists are dynamic, and are most reflective of the people who post<br/>most often (especially unmoderated lists). As the list steers course<br/>in one direction or another, it will appeal more and more to some<br/>readers, less and less to others. This is natural and there is no<br/>reason to find it detrimental or negative.</p><p>As for keeping track of lists, that is what is great about *not*<br/>using the web interface, but an email program that filters messages.<br/>Just my way of doing it, mind you, but certainly allows me to monitor<br/>multiple lists a lot easier than logging in and out of the &apos;groups&apos;<br/>interface.</p><p>The more (lists), the merrier, since focus becomes (potentially)<br/>refined.</p><p>Cheers,<br/>Jon</p></div>
