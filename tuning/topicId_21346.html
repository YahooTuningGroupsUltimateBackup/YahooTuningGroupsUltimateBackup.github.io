It&apos;s exciting to meet another person as crazy as i am!</p><p>Well, you came to the right place, as i&apos;m sure you&apos;ve already gathered now.</p><p>I&apos;ll attempt to talk about my understanding of the areas you&apos;ve mentioned.</p><p>&gt;I am also quite interested in the notion of Intervals of Equivalence other<br/>than the &quot;octave.&quot; I am &gt;undertaking an analysis of spectral concurrences of<br/>pitches in the Farey set of size 16, and using &gt;multidimensional scaling<br/>solution mapping in order to demonstrate that 2:1 is only the first of an<br/>infinite &gt;set of similarity dimensions in pitch space. Since I am doing this<br/>in my &quot;spare time&quot; it is taking quite a &gt;while, so if anyone knows of<br/>previously published papers on this subject please let me know; it would<br/>&gt;save me some work.</p><p>In my opinion, octave equivalence has to be confirmed or refuted in<br/>psychoacoustics, not just in mathematics. If you&apos;re interested in<br/>psychoacoustics there are some good references on the web such as Ersnt<br/>Terhardt&apos;s website. Either way, your work sounds fascinating to me and i&apos;ve<br/>done a lot of similar work:</p><p>on the harmonic entropy list i&apos;ve displayed 2-d plots of the triads<br/>available in the harmonic series (2-d plots, 1 point for each triad, three<br/>intervals plotted on three axes at 60-degree angles from one another. others<br/>observed fractal periodicities in the design that weren&apos;t strictly<br/>octave-repeating -- if you&apos;re interested, you can join<br/><a href="mailto:harmonic_entropy@yahoogroups.com">harmonic_entropy@yahoogroups.com</a> and look at the archives. To just see the<br/>first octave, look at<br/><a href="http://groups.yahoo.com/group/tuning/files/perlich/trimap.jpg">http://groups.yahoo.com/group/tuning/files/perlich/trimap.jpg</a>. The patterns<br/>repeat at smaller and smaller intervals after the first octave (but you<br/>can&apos;t see that here).</p><p>I&apos;ve done multidimensional scalings on the dissonances (interpreted as<br/>distances) of all the dyads in a scale. For example, a pentatonic scale<br/>would have 10 dyads, and a heptatonic scale, 21. Projected into three<br/>dimensions, such MS solutions provide a enlightening portrayal of the<br/>scale&apos;s harmonic resources. Robert W., what do you think -- can you lend<br/>your VRML expertise again?</p><p>&gt;For instance, 1:1 would be the median of the instrument, extending all the<br/>way to the front edge. Other &gt;&quot;primary&quot; intervals, like 2:1, 2:3, 4:3, are<br/>near the player. As intervals get into more dissonant territory &gt;(like 7:5,<br/>13:8, farther up the Farey tree), they are farther away from the player.<br/>This sounds exactly like Partch&apos;s one-footed bride or my dyadic harmonic<br/>entropy curves -- such as<br/><a href="http://groups.yahoo.com/group/tuning/files/perlich/ent_006.jpg">http://groups.yahoo.com/group/tuning/files/perlich/ent_006.jpg</a> and<br/><a href="http://groups.yahoo.com/group/tuning/files/perlich/tenney/te01_13p2877.jpg">http://groups.yahoo.com/group/tuning/files/perlich/tenney/te01_13p2877.jpg</a>,<br/>and more of which, of course, you can see over at<br/><a href="mailto:harmonic_entropy@yahoogroups.com">harmonic_entropy@yahoogroups.com</a>.</p><p>While you&apos;re at it, take a look at<br/><a href="http://groups.yahoo.com/group/tuning/files/perlich/triangle_01.jpg">http://groups.yahoo.com/group/tuning/files/perlich/triangle_01.jpg</a>.</p><p>i have a question, if i may -- will your melodies always be played against a<br/>tonic drone?</p><p>Glad again to meet you,<br/>paul</p></div><h3>ligonj@northstate.net</h3><span>4/20/2001 4:43:42 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In tuning@y..., &quot;Paul H.

This is where I like to<br/>see it &quot;confirmed or refuted&quot;. Many possible scales can have an<br/>interval so close to a 2/1 (remember Jeff Scott&apos;s scales), that it<br/>will serve the same purpose. Isn&apos;t there such a thing as<br/>a &quot;mathematical&quot; and a &quot;perceptual&quot; octave? I&apos;ve found that the<br/>bonding effect of certain non-octave scales, will provide enough<br/>stability with a near 2/1 (I&apos;m actually writing 6 new pieces without<br/>a 2/1 in sight, to prove the point). The possibilities are infinite!<br/>And I think it&apos;s a case by case thing about what these scales can<br/>offer. We&apos;d have to employ a 1000 psychoacousticians to measure it<br/>all! I&apos;m going to go ahead and make some tunes while they work it all<br/>out.</p><p>&gt; i have a question, if i may -- will your melodies always be played<br/>against a<br/>&gt; tonic drone?</p><p>He provided some clips on his site Paul.</p><p>Jacky Ligon</p></div><h3>Kurt S Nelson &#x3C;kurtnelson2@juno.com&#x3E;</h3><span>4/21/2001 1:41:56 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Hello again list,</p><p>Thank you for your sincere welcome.

The psychoacoustical part would need to be conducted using a<br/>Shepard-Krumhansl type probe tone study with the Farey set and a randomly<br/>selected panel.  I don&apos;t have the reference handy, but they used Shepard<br/>tones (which consist of frequency components at powers of two scaled<br/>across the range of human hearing) in 12TET in one octave.  Their<br/>analysis consisted, among other things, of a multidimensional scaling<br/>solution of the probe tone data.  This resulted in a four dimensional map<br/>of keyspace which can be projected onto a torus (doughnut) in three<br/>dimensions, with two closed circles of fifths spiralling around the<br/>outside (one for major keys and one for minor keys).  This is similar to<br/>the Schoenberg grid of key signitures if you wrapped it into a cylinder,<br/>and then wrapped it again into a torus.  The problem is, they achieve<br/>this closed result because they used Shepard tones in 12TET, not to<br/>mention they used a panel of less than twenty college students with more<br/>than six years of experience playing an instrument!!  I assert that the<br/>result would be quite different if you eliminated the use of Shepard<br/>tones in 12TET and used a statistically significant panel size!</p><p>A psychoacoustic understanding would also have to incorporate the notion<br/>of critical bandwidth, of which I understand very little at this point.<br/>Also I am not connected with a research facility or university of any<br/>kind.  Well, I have a B.S. in biology, but I got it &apos;94 and haven&apos;t even<br/>begun paying off my student loans!</p><p>Happy microtoning.<br/>Sincerely,<br/>Kurt</p></div><h3>PERLICH@ACADIAN-ASSET.COM</h3><span>4/21/2001 10:29:05 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In tuning@y..., Kurt S Nelson &lt;<br/>kurtnelson2@j...&gt; wrote:</p><p>&gt; And my thought on multidimensional scaling analysis of spectra is that<br/>&gt; the acoustical part would come first, because I currently have all the<br/>&gt; tools.

Glad we&apos;re on the same page, Kurt!</p><p>Dear Paul, et al:</p><p>&quot;Farey Music&quot; is my very first rendering of anything in JI.  You see, I<br/>have a situation similar to the person who posted a question about sound<br/>cards a while ago.  My machine is a 425mHz with sound built in, and it<br/>experiences drastic latency when running Direct Csound with even the<br/>simplest orchestras.  Furthermore, my MIDI keyboard is an old Casio,<br/>which will never be able to support sysex tuning dumps.  Consequently, I<br/>have no way of playing with non-12tET scales in real time!  &quot;Farey Music&quot;<br/>is the CSound rendering of some tone row scores algorithmically generated<br/>by a BASIC program I wrote, which assesses the probability of branching<br/>to a harmonically or subharmonically adjacent pitch based on a simple<br/>distance model of sonance.  I added the drone so that I could hear JI<br/>harmonies for the first time (it was a drone that was sitting around from<br/>an earlier project).  My plans are considerably more contrapunctal!  As<br/>in twelve-tone serialsm, no two rows are equivalent in their fludity or<br/>musical usefulness.  My next step is to hand pick the most useful and<br/>interesting Farey rows (a Farey row, by my definition, is a phrase<br/>beginning and ending on 1/1, and moving, in between, by harmonic and<br/>subharmonic steps), and treat them to various kinds of transpositions,<br/>retrogressions, inversions, and hemiolas.</p><p>My plan is develop my skills, in other words, by emulating in microcosm<br/>the historical development from monophony to polyphony to counterpoint<br/>and beyond.  (A good JI instrument or two would certainly speed this<br/>development.)</p><p>Happy microtoning,<br/>Kurt</p></div><h3>Alison Monteith &#x3C;alison.monteith3@which.net&#x3E;</h3><span>4/25/2001 1:41:14 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Kurt S Nelson wrote:</p><p>&gt; My plan is develop my skills, in other words, by emulating in microcosm<br/>&gt; the historical development from monophony to polyphony to counterpoint<br/>&gt; and beyond.
