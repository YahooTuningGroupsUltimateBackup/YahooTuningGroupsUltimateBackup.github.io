Edward Borasky &#x3C;znmeb@aracnet.com&#x3E;</h3><span>5/27/2002 10:20:34 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Well, given that it&apos;s only 83 pages, I decided to purchase and read it. I&apos;ll<br/>let you all know what I think when I&apos;m done with it. I guess my frame going<br/>into this, though, is that Harry Partch did what he did following *his*<br/>muse, Lou Harrison following *his* muse, and I do what I do for pretty much<br/>the same reason, given my skill set and the time I have available to devote<br/>to composition.</p><p>That said, why am *I* a micro / xentonalist? I think for all of the reasons<br/>Werntz cites: a desire to use existing musical materials from times and<br/>places other than the times and places covered by the 12-tone equal tempered<br/>scale, a belief in the *sounds* of just intonation, though not necessarily<br/>the numerology thereof, and an &quot;urge to add pitches &quot;. In the end, though, I<br/>think I align more with the psychoacoustic and xentonal schools of<br/>composition than I do with, say, Partch. As you probably know, I used Partch<br/>&apos;s materials for a recent piece but never wished to limit myself to that<br/>scheme, as rich in resources as it happens to be. And I probably drifted<br/>from my core goal, which is to create music using computers that can&apos;t be<br/>done with more conventional technologies. I suspect a choir could execute<br/>&quot;When Harry Met Iannis&quot; fairly easily, for example.</p><p>I&apos;m moving on, as I&apos;ve noted, to some more complex algorithmic composition,<br/>and my next piece will probably be xentonal in the Sethares sense rather<br/>than microtonal in the Partch sense. I&apos;m trying to move from Sethares&apos;<br/>&quot;weird but pleasant&quot; music to something &quot;alien yet hauntingly beautiful&quot;. I<br/>fully expect to spend at least three months on this next one, and maybe<br/>more.</p><p>-----Original Message-----<br/>From: jpehrson2 [<a href="mailto:jpehrson@rcn.com">mailto:jpehrson@rcn.com</a>]<br/>Sent: Monday, May 27, 2002 9:06 PM<br/>To: <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a><br/>Subject: [tuning] I deleted my post!</p><p>Er.. yes, I did that.

It<br/>seemed to me that she was dissing Partch, JI composers, the entire JI<br/>school and world musics and was promoting equal temperament and the<br/>European modernist use of microtones.</p><p>I was angry that she was setting up these divisions in an area that<br/>*already* is such a small subset of a subset, i.e. microtonalists,<br/>and therefore, I wrote a vitrolic post to this forum.</p><p>Now, all the *sensible* people who were actually out *enjoying*<br/>Memorial Day rather than sitting at the computer, didn&apos;t read that.<br/>However, shortly thereafter I received a *very* strong e-mail from<br/>Julia herself, and I *had* been in contact with her previously.</p><p>She felt that the extract did not really portray her attitudes<br/>correctly, but that she is actually taking an &quot;anti-academic&quot; stance<br/>in the support of the kind of pitch addition/usage employed by Joe<br/>Maneri, since his music is what the diss. is about.</p><p>So, I deleted my post to be fair.  Julie says people should read the<br/>PERSPECTIVES article carefully and *then* judge.  So I will do that,<br/>if I can get ahold of it.</p><p>She was correct in asserting that I had responded to the extract<br/>without either reading the entire diss. *or* the article and one<br/>could make a case for the fact that that is unfair.</p><p>If, after reading the Perspectives article, I come to the same<br/>conclusions -- quite frankly, Jon, I can&apos;t see how my attitudes are<br/>going to change all that much, since I thought the extract was pretty<br/>clear :) -- I will write about it.</p><p>So, maybe I&apos;m not even reversing my opinion.  Julia is *encouraging*<br/>discussion on the diss., and I&apos;m prepared to do that.</p><p>So, I&apos;m not really *reversing* just witholding judgement until I read<br/>the Perspectives.</p><p>I&apos;m sure Julie will be happy to have thoughtful commentary on her<br/>diss. even if it disses the diss.  At least that&apos;s the sentiment I<br/>get from her.</p><p>Please keep in mind also, Jon, that she *was* somebody I had had<br/>pleasant correspondence with before, so she isn&apos;t somebody that I<br/>totally didn&apos;t know...</p><p>Joe</p></div><h3>David Beardsley &#x3C;davidbeardsley@biink.com&#x3E;</h3><span>5/28/2002 7:18:20 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>----- Original Message -----<br/>From: &quot;jpehrson2&quot; &lt;<a href="mailto:jpehrson@rcn.com">jpehrson@rcn.com</a>&gt;</p><p>&gt; Now, all the *sensible* people who were actually out *enjoying*<br/>&gt; Memorial Day rather than sitting at the computer, didn&apos;t read that.</p><p>You might be able to delete a post from Yahoo, but<br/>you can&apos;t unsend the email.
