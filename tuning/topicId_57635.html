THIS kind of authenticity is what I was referring to.<br/>Which brings us back to the MP3s on that webpage... Seriously, does a<br/>fluffy, phoney, cliched piece like &quot;knots and folds&quot; really have value and<br/>meaning to you guys??  It is honestly the best example of a derivative<br/>piece of music that I could ever conceive.
