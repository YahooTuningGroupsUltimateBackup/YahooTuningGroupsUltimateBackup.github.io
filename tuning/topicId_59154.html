This temperament (79 MOS) is reserved for Qanuns ONLY (and theory on paper if I can achieve it). Maqam scales will undoubtedly be expressed as JI intervals independent of a pitch standard for the tonic. But when it comes to mapping these JI intervals (probably hundreds in number given all transpositions), you clearly need a temperament to embrace them in as convenient and elegant a way as possible.</p><p>What is gained by doing so??? You may ask yourself then what is gained by affixing the mandals of a Qanun at 53tET, or worse 60tET? Is there such a possibility as a JI Qanun for Maqam Music? I will tell you, that you cannot evade wolves once you begin transposing your scale to other degrees of the gamut and the results will the catastrophic. Is it not obvious that you need a temperament for fixed-tuning instruments? Is there a piano tuned to JI that can sound a Chopin Etude without making the listeners wince?</p><p>I am not at all restricting Maqam Music tuning to 79 MOS... How can you assume I intend to do so? This is only one of the roughest approximations to Maqam intervals that I can come up with. Of course Ouds, Tanburs, Kemenchas and so on will re-calibrate their frets the way they see fit. Still, you will likely observe that the deviations will not be more than 5-6 cents from 79MOS.</p><p>Maybe I am too bold, but I think 79MOS fits Persian and Arabic tunings equally well, and thus, is of a universal character in this geography. Of course, masters will tell if I am right or not.</p><p>Cordially,<br/>Ozan</p><p>  ----- Original Message -----<br/>  From: Kraig Grady<br/>  To: <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a><br/>  Sent: 15 Haziran 2005 &Ccedil;ar&scedil;amba 20:37<br/>  Subject: [tuning] : Re: Meantone Maquams</p><p>  Why not express the scale in JI then.
