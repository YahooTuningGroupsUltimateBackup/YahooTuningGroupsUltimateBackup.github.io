Things have been getting a little intense around here lately.  I&apos;ve<br/>read things over a couple of times, but still need a little assistance.</p><p>What I&apos;m getting is this:  we have abstract mathematical generators for<br/>making musical scales.  Jason Yust wants to find some that generate<br/>&quot;proper&quot; scales quickly, thereby being &quot;efficient.&quot;</p><p>Somehow 2^Phi seems to satisfy these conditions, and was demonstrated by<br/>Paul Erlich through a mighty addition of all kinds of 1&apos;s...</p><p>However, no practical scale IN EXISTENCE has ever used these kinds of<br/>mathematical constructs. Ironically, though, 2^Phi is actually very<br/>close to a perfect fifth, so scales constructed from fundamental<br/>acoustical intervals are, somewhat coincidentally, very close to the<br/>conceptual scales generated through abstract mathematics. (Or at least<br/>arithmetic).</p><p>Then there is a curious &quot;scale tree&quot; over in Anaphoria that looks like<br/>the beautiful bark of a large cut oak, with aging lines filled in with<br/>numbers.  I&apos;m guessing this all has to do with various scale<br/>generators... but am a little foggy yet here...</p><p>Finally, Pierre Lamothe, the &quot;challenger&quot; happened to come on the scene<br/>discussing scale generators.  My French is very &quot;comme ci comme ca.&quot;</p><p>OK.  So I will read this all over again, but perhaps a little<br/>summary/clarification would be helpful first, so it &quot;sinks in&quot;<br/>better...  If this is too redundant for the list, please post off-line.</p><p>However, I&apos;m betting that at least a couple of other people could<br/>benefit from the elucidation.</p><p>Thanks, group!!!</p><p>____________ _______ ___ __ _<br/>Joseph Pehrson</p></div>
