I referred to split-key<br/>keyboards for that reason, they were supposed to address other notes<br/>that were &apos;broken&apos; in 5 limit harmony. C was a very popular key.

I don&apos;t think you<br/>&gt; can conlude anything about the 7-limit from this, because it would<br/>&gt; have made a lot more sense in the 5-limit.</p><p>Except that the most popular key, C, and the second most popular chord,<br/>G7, was broken if they wanted 7-limit and used a single F.

Here is what I think is the consensus view,<br/>taken from &lt;url: <a href="http://www.medieval.org/emfaq/harmony/pyth.html">http://www.medieval.org/emfaq/harmony/pyth.html</a>&gt;.<br/>Possibly it leaves open the question of what to do about Dunstaple or<br/>Dufay, but the nature of the music they wrote pretty well answers<br/>that; it would be  &quot;flawed&quot; and &quot;unsuitable&quot; for the same reasons<br/>that would apply to Ockeghem or Josquin. Assuming they should be<br/>performed like Perotin or Machaut is absurd; that contemporary<br/>theorists had not yet caught up with the avant garde is no surprise.</p><p>{{Remaining the standard theoretical approach in the High Gothic era<br/>of the 13th century, Pythagorean tuning seems very congenial to the<br/>complex polyphony and subtle harmonic continuum of composers such as<br/>Perotin, Adam de la Halle, and Petrus de Cruce. It also nicely fits<br/>the style of many 14th-century works, such as the famous Mass of<br/>Guillaume de Machaut.</p><p>By around 1420 on the Continent, however, musical style had begun to<br/>change in ways that invited new tunings. As composers such as Dufay<br/>and Binchois emulated John Dunstable, and gave their music<br/>an &quot;English countenance&quot; with a more and more pervasive emphasis on<br/>thirds and sixths, fashion moved in the direction of intonations that<br/>would make these intervals more smoothly blending. By the end of the<br/>century, such tunings (e.g. meantone) were becoming the norm in<br/>theory as well as practice.</p><p>The unsuitability of medieval Pythagorean intonation for Renaissance<br/>music should not be seen as a &quot;flaw,&quot; any more than Renaissance<br/>meantone tuning is &quot;flawed&quot; because it is hardly suitable for the<br/>works of Wagner or Max Reger. Rather, techniques of tuning and<br/>notation interact creatively with musical style in each period, and<br/>should all be taken into consideration in understanding and<br/>recreating the music of a given age.}}</p></div><h3><a id=28289 href="#28289">ðŸ”—</a>Paul Erlich &#x3C;paul@stretch-music.com&#x3E;</h3><span>9/17/2001 8:34:16 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In tuning@y..., genewardsmith@j... wrote:</p><p>&gt; I was making no claim of historical accuracy for tuning the seventh<br/>&gt; degree to a 7, which would be silly.</p><p>But that&apos;s what several people are doing (not that I object to them<br/>doing it for their own and others&apos; entertainment).</p><p>&gt; What I *was* saying is that<br/>&gt; considered purely vertically, we have what sounds like an out-of-<br/>tune<br/>&gt; 4-5-6-7, just as we had what sounded like an out-of-tune 4-5-6.

All sorts of &quot;adaptive&quot; adjustments can take<br/>place. Have you listened to John deLaubenfels&apos; 5-limit vs. 7-limit<br/>MIDI retunings (<a href="http://adaptune.com">adaptune.com</a>)? You might like the 7-limit ones, if<br/>your philosophy holds true for your ears. For John&apos;s program can make<br/>commas vanish you never thought possible!<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; The evidence is that until you produce something that shows that F<br/>&gt; &gt; was supposed to move during the cadential passages, then there is<br/>no<br/>&gt; &gt; reason to think that it was supposed to.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I&apos;m not proposing to move F, or suggesting it was supposed to move.<br/>&gt; I&apos;m asking where is the evidence people preferred the sound of<br/>&gt; 4:5:6:36/5 over 4:5:6:7 as a chord, and picked it because they<br/>liked<br/>&gt; the sound of it.</p><p>It didn&apos;t happen that way.</p><p>&gt; This I don&apos;t buy,</p><p>Good -- you invented it!</p><p>&gt; and I think the historical<br/>&gt; evidence needs to work harder if you are going to sell it.</p><p>Musicians in Monteverdi&apos;s time didn&apos;t think of chords as entities<br/>yet. They didn&apos;t &quot;pick&quot; harmonies in this way. They composed<br/>individual melodic lines. Even later in the Baroque, the<br/>understanding of &quot;chords&quot; was limited -- triads were chords of the<br/>third and fifth or chords of the third and sixth. The chord with the<br/>minor third and major sixth was special because of the tritone. No<br/>one had yet decided that the chord of the minor third and minor<br/>sixth, along with the chord of the major third and fifth, formed one<br/>category (what we now call &quot;major&quot;) while the chord of the major<br/>third and major sixth, along with the chord of the minor third and<br/>fifth, formed another (&quot;minor&quot;). No one even conceived of music as a<br/>set of &quot;chord progressions&quot; like we do today.

Specifically, I&apos;d like to advocate<br/>the usual historical tunings as a &quot;mainstream&quot; practice, while also<br/>recognizing a place for &quot;alternative&quot; practices such as those proposed by<br/>Euler in 1764 -- if my reading is correct -- and carried out by John<br/>deLaubenfels today.</p><p>In the 18th century, as in the early 21st century, there was evidently<br/>room for a range of views, and Euler&apos;s advocacy of a more &quot;consonant&quot;<br/>tuning of the dominant seventh at 36:45:54:63 might serve as a precedent<br/>for this kind of adaptive interpretation as a kind of minority alternative<br/>to something like 36:45:54:64 (with 16:9 minor seventh), or a meantone<br/>type of solution.</p><p>First of all, the question of intonation in Dufay might have a<br/>somewhat different character in his earlier and later periods.</p><p>For the era of around 1420-1440, where the stable trine (2:3:4) serves<br/>as the goal of directed progressions, and many 14th-century style<br/>cadences occur, some form of Pythagorean tuning with some prominent<br/>schisma thirds can be very attractive.</p><p>Indeed, I have found textures with sixth sonorities (fauxbourdon) very<br/>attractive in either a traditional 14th-century Pythagorean tuning<br/>such as Eb-G#, or in the likely early 15th-century scheme of Gb-B.</p><p>In a 17-note Pythagorean scheme for keyboard (Gb-A#), or with<br/>flexible-pitch instruments and voices, one possibility is generally to<br/>use regular Pythagorean thirds and sixths for traditional cadences<br/>(Maj6-8, Maj3-5), and for melodic passages, while often favoring<br/>schisma thirds for prolonged noncadential sonorities.</p><p>As we move into the later period of Dufay, sonorities involving thirds<br/>and sixths seem to take on a more &quot;nearly-stable&quot; or &quot;solid&quot; quality,<br/>where some approximation of 5-limit seems likely. This is also the<br/>epoch of keyboard composers such as Conrad Paumann (c. 1450) where<br/>meantone becomes a stylistically indicated choice according to<br/>scholars such as Mark Lindley.</p><p>Even in the late 15th century, however, singers may have had some<br/>tendency toward Pythagorean intonation in the performance of at least<br/>some passages by composers such as Ockeghem, for example.</p><p>The theoretical mixture of Pythagorean, meantone-oriented, and<br/>emerging &quot;5-limit&quot; concepts in this epoch may reflect a fluid<br/>intonational situation.</p><p>One might guess that while meantone was standard practice for<br/>keyboards in many parts of Europe by around 1480-1500, the 5-limit<br/>paradigm for singers may have become more clearly evident by around<br/>1520-1530, as _major_ thirds were increasingly preferred as the most<br/>euphonious and conclusive, a trend reflected both in actual music and<br/>in the writings and examples of a theorist such as Pietro Aron (1523,<br/>1525, 1529).</p><p>Of course, the treatise on the syntonic diatonic by Fogliano (1529),<br/>and Zarlino&apos;s great _Harmonic Institutions_ (1558), make the 5-limit<br/>paradigm a definitive one -- a focus on just or near-just thirds also<br/>being a vital element of Vicentino&apos;s treatise (1555).</p><p>Moving now to the 7-limit question, I consider the minor seventh at<br/>several eras and periods.</p><p>First of all, the minor seventh is a bold interval and cadential<br/>element in much music from Perotin (c. 1200) to Guillaume de Machaut<br/>(c. 1300-1377) and some other 14th-century composers.</p><p>In a trinic context, it often, for example, contracts by directed<br/>contrary motion to a fifth. Here the &quot;closest approach&quot; principle<br/>nicely exemplified by a regular Pythagorean tuning -- rather narrow<br/>cadential semitones at around 90 cents (256:243) -- might be yet<br/>further amplified by tuning a cadential minor seventh at around 7:4,<br/>or 969 cents. In Pythagorean tuning, it is 16:9, or about 996 cents.</p><p>This _might_ have happened in some Gothic practice, especially if we<br/>assume that Marchettus of Padua is advocating an amplified &quot;closest<br/>approach&quot; principle for cadential major thirds and sixths, taken<br/>somewhat wider than Pythagorean. The same practice, by analogy, would<br/>call for yet narrower cadential minor thirds and sevenths.</p><p>In the early 21st century, this is a routine _neo_-Gothic practice,<br/>with sonorities like 12:14:18:21 (0-267-702-969 cents) contracting to<br/>a stable fifth. Using the sign &quot;v&quot; to show a note a septimal comma or<br/>64:63 lower than the usual Pythagorean step, we have</p><p>            Dv4  C4             Fv4   E4<br/>            B3   C4             D4    E4<br/>            Gv3  F3             Bbv3  A3<br/>            E3   F3      or     G3    A3</p><p>Personally, I would describe this as a 21st-century practice that just<br/>_might_ have occurred sometime, somewhere in Europe, during the era of<br/>1200-1400 -- in that amount of medieval time and geographic space,<br/>lots of things could happen intonationally.</p><p>Moving to the use of prominent minor sevenths in the late modal era<br/>around 1600, it&apos;s interesting that one of the first advocates of these<br/>progressions, Vincenzo Galilei, gives the ratio for a minor seventh as<br/>9:5, or around 1018 cents. He advocates bold minor seventh sonorities<br/>including tritonic intervals as an expressive use of dissonance.</p><p>More generally, I might observe that an interval around 7:4 -- for<br/>example the meantone interval often spelled as an augmented sixth --<br/>does not _necessarily_ sound to all listeners as an outstanding<br/>concord.</p><p>Writing in 1555, for example, and taking an interest in various<br/>altered intervals -- &quot;microtonal&quot; inflections in 20th-century terms --<br/>on his archicembalo with a 31-note meantone cycle, Vicentino finds the<br/>augmented sixth (or interval a diesis smaller than a usual minor<br/>seventh) rather dissonant, while finding a near-11:9 rather<br/>concordant.</p><p>In this era, &quot;seventh&quot; generally means &quot;dissonant,&quot; with either 9:5 or<br/>a near-7:4 -- or the meantone minor seventh somewhere in between but<br/>closer to 9:5 (around 1007 cents) -- having this general quality from<br/>a 16th-century perspective. (The minor seventh in 1/4-comma meantone<br/>with pure major thirds is more precisely midway between 9:5 and 16:9.)</p><p>Vicentino also finds a near-7:6 or &quot;minimal third&quot; leaning toward a<br/>dissonant second. I happen to find this same interval rather<br/>concordant, showing that adventurous &quot;microtonalists&quot; (again using a<br/>20th-century characterization) can have a range of views.</p><p>Paul, I agree that the Manneristic and Baroque practices of the 17th<br/>century -- whichever terms we prefer -- are based on the use of<br/>sevenths and other &quot;discordant&quot; intervals as dissonances, often<br/>provocatively mixed with concords such as thirds to produce sonorities<br/>at once &quot;bitter&quot; and &quot;sweet.&quot; It is not so much the seventh itself,<br/>but the mixture of other intervals in the same sonority such as<br/>thirds, which evidently makes them appear to have this &quot;bittersweet&quot;<br/>quality, at least if we follow what some of the theoretical advocates<br/>say.</p><p>However, one might investigate the use of the augmented sixth in a<br/>meantone setting, for example, to look for evidence that this interval<br/>might have been regarded as less dissonant or more concordant in some<br/>of the repertory -- something on which you, Paul, or others familiar<br/>with the 17th-18th century practices might comment.</p><p>By 1764, Euler does, as I read the translation made available by Monz,<br/>advocate a dominant seventh tuned at 36:45:54:63 (4:5:6:7) as a<br/>consonant development making this sonority yet more smooth or<br/>attractive: &lt;<a href="http://www.ixpres.com/interval/monzo/euler/euler-en.htm">http://www.ixpres.com/interval/monzo/euler/euler-en.htm</a>&gt;.<br/>If my reading is correct, we might well take him as an authority for<br/>7-limit adaptive tunings as _an_ alternative interpretation with some<br/>18th-century basis -- but not necessarily _the_ prevailing<br/>interpretation.</p><p>One could argue that Euler&apos;s proposal for modified instruments able to<br/>support this tuning of the dominant seventh suggests that the<br/>prevailing practice was otherwise -- as does a consideration of the<br/>meantone and well-temperament schemes for keyboards then in vogue.</p><p>People more involved with 18th-19th century styles might comment on<br/>this more knowledgeably, or make more artfully educated guesses, and<br/>that is a major theme of this thread.</p><p>However, my experience with the medieval or neo-Gothic minor seventh<br/>question suggests that a range of tunings may be pleasing, depending<br/>on one&apos;s taste or one&apos;s mood at a given moment. For E3-B3-D4, for<br/>example, a sonority occurring prominently in Machaut, either a usual<br/>Pythagorean 0-702-996 or a &quot;7-flavor&quot; 0-702-969 can be just fine for<br/>me, with the contrast between these forms affording another element of<br/>choice.</p><p>Similarly, I may love a cadential sixth sonority like G3-B3-E4<br/>(resolving to F3-C4-F4) at a &quot;7-flavor&quot; 7:9:12, 0-435-933 cents, but<br/>the regular Pythagorean 0-408-906 is just fine, also.</p><p>In a usual &quot;historically oriented&quot; performance, I&apos;d stick with the<br/>Pythagorean; in a neo-Gothic interpretation, or a guess as to what<br/>singers following the kind of tradition described by Marchettus of<br/>Padua _might_ have done with this sonority, I often go with 7:9:12.</p><p>My main point might be that low-integer JI, complex JI (Pythagorean<br/>the most notable historical example), and approximations of various<br/>tempered schemes are all possibilities.</p><p>Sometimes theorists do give us valuable clues. Both Zarlino and<br/>Vincenzo Galilei, in an often intense debate on intonational and other<br/>issues, agree that singers follow something close to the syntonic<br/>diatonic, but avoiding comma problems or the dissonances (e.g. 40:27)<br/>that would result from a fixed syntonic diatonic scale.</p><p>Zarlino argues that voices naturally seek the pure consonances of the<br/>syntonic diatonic, but adjust to avoid discords; Galilei argues that,<br/>if so, they are not singing precisely the syntonic diatonic, but<br/>something very close. He also takes meantone as a rough model, again<br/>noting that voices avoid the commas and dissonances of the syntonic<br/>diatonic -- and suggesting a tendency toward whole-tones of the same<br/>size.</p><p>Adaptive 5-limit JI would seem to meet all these criteria, providing a<br/>way to reconcile the views of these two theorists.</p><p>With the 7-limit question, I would say that Euler in 1764 provides a<br/>basis for tuning at least some dominant sevenths 4:5:6:7 as a likely<br/>&quot;minority&quot; preference in the 18th century, especially with flexible<br/>pitch instruments and ensembles.</p><p>However, I would be very hesitant to read any &quot;7-based&quot; viewpoint into<br/>minor sevenths as used prominently either in medieval textures and<br/>cadences of the era 1200-1400, or in later Manneristic or Baroque<br/>practice starting in the era around 1600 (and advocated in Galilei&apos;s<br/>counterpoint treatises of around 1588-1590).</p><p>It is certainly possible to perform, compose, or improvise music in<br/>these medieval and early modern European styles using 7:4 minor<br/>sevenths or close equivalents, and _some_ performances of the Gothic<br/>or Manneristic and Baroque eras may have used them also, but I would<br/>consider this as an &quot;alternative&quot; rather than main reading of<br/>historical compositions.</p><p>Most respectfully,</p><p>Margo Schulter<br/><a href="mailto:mschulter@value.net">mschulter@value.net</a></p></div><h3><a id=28298 href="#28298">ðŸ”—</a>genewardsmith@juno.com</h3><span>9/18/2001 1:29:34 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In tuning@y..., &quot;Paul Erlich&quot; &lt;paul@s...&gt; wrote:</p><p>&gt; Ignoring that where?

Assuming they should be<br/>&gt; performed like Perotin or Machaut is absurd; that contemporary<br/>&gt; theorists had not yet caught up with the avant garde is no surprise.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; {{Remaining the standard theoretical approach in the High Gothic<br/>era<br/>&gt; of the 13th century, Pythagorean tuning seems very congenial to the<br/>&gt; complex polyphony and subtle harmonic continuum of composers such<br/>as<br/>&gt; Perotin, Adam de la Halle, and Petrus de Cruce. It also nicely fits<br/>&gt; the style of many 14th-century works, such as the famous Mass of<br/>&gt; Guillaume de Machaut.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; By around 1420 on the Continent, however, musical style had begun<br/>to<br/>&gt; change in ways that invited new tunings.</p><p>Note that I said &quot;before the early 15th century&quot; above!</p><p>&gt; As composers such as Dufay<br/>&gt; and Binchois emulated John Dunstable, and gave their music<br/>&gt; an &quot;English countenance&quot; with a more and more pervasive emphasis on<br/>&gt; thirds and sixths, fashion moved in the direction of intonations<br/>that<br/>&gt; would make these intervals more smoothly blending. By the end of<br/>the<br/>&gt; century, such tunings (e.g. meantone) were becoming the norm in<br/>&gt; theory as well as practice.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; The unsuitability of medieval Pythagorean intonation for<br/>Renaissance<br/>&gt; music should not be seen as a &quot;flaw,&quot; any more than Renaissance<br/>&gt; meantone tuning is &quot;flawed&quot; because it is hardly suitable for the<br/>&gt; works of Wagner or Max Reger. Rather, techniques of tuning and<br/>&gt; notation interact creatively with musical style in each period, and<br/>&gt; should all be taken into consideration in understanding and<br/>&gt; recreating the music of a given age.}}</p><p>100% agreed.</p></div><h3><a id=28312 href="#28312">ðŸ”—</a>Paul Erlich &#x3C;paul@stretch-music.com&#x3E;</h3><span>9/18/2001 12:40:21 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In tuning@y..., genewardsmith@j... wrote:<br/>&gt; --- In tuning@y..., &quot;Paul Erlich&quot; &lt;paul@s...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; Ignoring that where?

Good. You have already commented favorably on my statement<br/>that in a brief passing seventh over a dominant triad, I wouldn&apos;t<br/>necessarily expect performers of any era to suddenly veer as far<br/>south of the normal diatonic position of the seventh as a strict 7-<br/>limit 4:5:6:7 would dictate. We agree here. and i have never proposed<br/>that it is the &quot;one true way&quot;.</p><p>However, many singers and flexible pitch instruments such as strings<br/>make quick, smooth pitch adjustments of this order of magnitude all<br/>the time, even when it is simply fixing an initial pitch error not<br/>justifiable as 7-limit or any other coherently related tuning.<br/>Consequently, I find it difficult to believe that in practice anyone<br/>would perceive a sustained 7th in 4:5:6:7 occurring over a dominant<br/>as objectional or being out of tune, or even melodically<br/>inappropriate unless they had some academic axe to grind.</p><p>We should bear in mind always that the midi files with which we test<br/>some of our ideas with our ears are generally quite inflexible pitch-<br/>wise (excluding the adaptive JI software from JdL) and therefore do<br/>not represemt well what happens in practice with voices, strings,<br/>etc. For example, the comma problem that occurs when tuning first<br/>finger E on the D string of a violin to the open G and then to the<br/>open A in sequence does not generate anything like the same kind of<br/>melodic earthquake in practice with adaptive JI-oriented string<br/>playing as it does in a midi file. We&apos;ve already agreed on that.</p><p>Further, I think you underestimate the attractive power of the 7th<br/>harmonic in this context if this harmonic structure is sustained for<br/>any significant time. I have already explained how I have trained<br/>musically, and ESPECIALLY intonationally naive singers using<br/>exercises very explicitly based on the difference product phenomenon.</p><p>(I have explained long ago that I think flexibly-pitched<br/>instrumentalists use this intuitively and usually unconsciously to<br/>tune harmony accurately. There is not time to do this with beats<br/>between common harmonics, since the beats are usually too slow unless<br/>we include huge pitch errors or very long notes. Also pitch training<br/>using the beat approach is terribly and demonstrably ineffective with<br/>amateurs when contrasted with the difference products approach except<br/>for unisons and octaves, in which case the beat phenomenon is easily<br/>detectable at the fundamental of both or one of the tones<br/>respectively and there are no difference products at frequencies not<br/>duplicating a fundamental.)</p><p>This training initially involved only perfect fifths and fourths and<br/>major thirds. Yet once sensitivity to the presence of difference<br/>products was developed, it was spontaneously transferable to more<br/>complex harmonies, including a natural gravitation toward the 7th<br/>harmonic version of the V7 chord. It should be clear, therefore, that<br/>this is not based on a pre-conditioned preference specific to a<br/>particular harmonic structure, but a more general underlying<br/>psychoacoustic phenomenon to which the subjects in question had been<br/>senstizied, easily extensible to new harmonic experience, and that<br/>forms a highly significant and powerful component of the<br/>psychoacoustic phenomena at the very basis of the appeal of harmony<br/>in the first place.</p><p>As I&apos;ve stated previously, I have no good reason to believe that this<br/>phenomenon is peculiar to our time. Why would it be, and why would<br/>anyone want to propose that it is? To do so would defy any sense of<br/>theoretical economy, as would invoking other, less objectively<br/>verifiable explanations.</p><p>So just as I believe the psychoacoustically attractive power of 5:4<br/>effectively &quot;conspired&quot; with the dominant use of polyphonic vocal<br/>ensembles in the church music of the late medieval and early<br/>Renaisance eras to nudge the expansion of 3-limit JI to 5-limit, I<br/>also believe that the attractive power for flexibly pitched voices or<br/>instruments of the 7-limit V7 is no respecter of theoretical<br/>preferences and intonational belief systems now or at any time in the<br/>past.</p><p>If this is correct, it constitutes a clear example of a universal<br/>human perceptual metastructure that lies at the basis of an<br/>evolutionary process that cannot be explained on the basis of<br/>historical and anecdotal evidence alone. Moreover, it is NOT<br/>dependent on the inappropriate imposition of aesthetics from other<br/>times or conditioned phenomena that may not have existed during the<br/>era in question.</p><p>Once we understand the time- and culture-independent psychoacoustic<br/>phenomena behind such an evolutionary process, our reading of the<br/>historical evidence is not prejudiced, but simply informed in a way<br/>that allows us to appreciate the broader context of that evidence in<br/>order to give it an appropriately enlightened interpretation.</p></div><h3><a id=28425 href="#28425">ðŸ”—</a>BobWendell@technet-inc.com</h3><span>9/21/2001 10:32:49 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In tuning@y..., klaus schmirler &lt;KSchmir@z...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; BobWendell@t... schrieb:<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; Paul said:<br/>&gt; &gt; The concept of major and minor triads with their different<br/>inversions<br/>&gt; &gt; was introduced by Rameau.

I would suggest letting<br/>our<br/>&gt; &gt; ears be our guide.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I would agree with the article -- its author is none other than our<br/>&gt; own Margo Schulter. But my point, with which Margo agrees, is that<br/>a<br/>&gt; 4:5:6:7 tuning for dominant seventh chords in the Baroque era is no<br/>&gt; more appropriate than a 5-limit tuning for chords of thirds and/or<br/>&gt; sixths in earlier Continental Medieval music . . . say Perotin.</p><p>Bob comments:<br/>Given certain natural proclivities of human hearing demonstrably not<br/>dependent on cultural conditioning, I question whether we can package<br/>the tunings appropriate to each period so neatly as these and similar<br/>statements made elsewhere seem to imply, especially for non-fixed-<br/>pitch musical media. Although much historical evidence may seem to<br/>suggest we can, such evidence represents only current<br/>conceptualizations and belief systems of the times, much of which,<br/>although informative (never said worthless, Paul), may only apply to<br/>fixed-pitch instruments.</p><p>I have also stated elsewhere my belief that we cannot lend an<br/>adequately enlightened interpretation to this evidence without taking<br/>into account the universals implicit in human auditory processing,<br/>independent of time, space, and cultural conditioning.

Maybe some rare human beings had<br/>developed such a microtonally precise melodic memory (Johnny Reinhard<br/>comes to mind), but that would be highly exceptional and certainly<br/>not the norm.</p><p>It obviously doesn&apos;t work that way in common practice today. Why<br/>should it have ever? Yet documentary evidence of the relatively<br/>exquisite sense of harmonic pitch accuracy is extensive for times<br/>extending from the middle ages to the dawn of pervasive 12-tET and<br/>its virtually total relegation to tuning professionals when<br/>this sensitivity began to erode.

THAT&apos;S THE FUNDAMENTAL AESTHETIC PREMISE UPON WHICH MY<br/>ARGUMENTS ARE BASED. My evidence is primarily based on my own<br/>experimentation and my own musical ear (which I consider my best<br/>feature). But the historical writings play some role, as do published<br/>experiments such as:</p><p>&quot;Rasch&apos;s study (1985) of large sequences of simultaneous tones found<br/>that mistuning of the intervals of the melody was more disturbing<br/>than mistuning of simultaneous intervals. This suggests that<br/>listeners compare melodic intervals to an abstract interval standard.<br/>Since Vos only used two-voice polyphonic settings, it is likely that<br/>his attempts to isolate preferences of harmony were partially<br/>undermined by melodic mistunings.&quot;<br/>(<a href="http://music.dartmouth.edu/~kov/lerdahl/tuningPaper.html">http://music.dartmouth.edu/~kov/lerdahl/tuningPaper.html</a>)</p></div><h3><a id=28440 href="#28440">ðŸ”—</a>Afmmjr@aol.com</h3><span>9/21/2001 2:50:02 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>In a message dated 9/21/01 4:05:27 PM Eastern Daylight Time,<br/><a href="mailto:BobWendell@technet-inc.com">BobWendell@technet-inc.com</a> writes:</p><p>&gt; Such thinking would assume that melodic memory (not in the sense of<br/>&gt; &quot;carrying a tune&quot;, but in the precise sense of exact imitation with<br/>&gt; microtonal accuracy) is more compelling than the appeal to the human<br/>&gt; ear of harmonic consonance. Maybe some rare human beings had<br/>&gt; developed such a microtonally precise melodic memory (Johnny Reinhard<br/>&gt; comes to mind), but that would be highly exceptional and certainly<br/>&gt; not the norm.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;</p><p>But the highest level professionals are not the norm.  Neither was J.S. Bach<br/>the norm.  I remember Odetta (also not the norm) rehearsing for hours before<br/>her performance on an AFMM concert on May 14, 1988.  She had what might best<br/>be called &quot;etched&quot; intervals for &quot;God&apos;s Gonna Cut You Down&quot; and &quot;Black Woman&quot;<br/>that had an exact placement in her mind, and it was repeatable...if she<br/>practiced.  (I do have recordings of 2 different performances on the same day<br/>and they could be contrasted.) Odetta would have been Harry Partch&apos;s ideal<br/>vocalist, and he would have preferred her instead of many a male part (or so<br/>he said in a letter).</p><p>Bach was a chromaticist each time he used all 12 notes in a piece (which was<br/>pretty often).  The etched sound of Werckmeister&apos;s scales are exact in<br/>character based on key, as if one went back into time.  This is one of the<br/>very few cases where one can have certainty with a composer&apos;s tuning.  At<br/>least if one comes to believe that Werckmeister&apos;s tuning is Bach&apos;s, then<br/>there is a one-cent exactness or better to each note.  It is not much of a<br/>leap to suggest that the melodic traditions that Bach inherited were well<br/>served by an exact set of 12 major and minor keys which were &quot;exactly&quot;<br/>different.  Such wonders could be achieved, all quite mastered by the highly<br/>exceptional.  An exceptional, like Bach, could influence tremendously the<br/>performance results of others, as does Bob.  When only one person hears it,<br/>others can achieve, too.</p><p>Consider, anyone who can believe in any of a number of &quot;odd/West tunings&quot;<br/>would have to believe that one &quot;could&quot; believe most any set of tones or<br/>sounds as legitimate, even reproducible.

Good. You have already commented favorably on my<br/>&gt; statement<br/>&gt; &gt; that in a brief passing seventh over a dominant triad, I wouldn&apos;t<br/>&gt; &gt; necessarily expect performers of any era to suddenly veer as far<br/>&gt; &gt; south of the normal diatonic position of the seventh as a strict<br/>7-<br/>&gt; &gt; limit 4:5:6:7 would dictate. We agree here. and i have never<br/>&gt; proposed<br/>&gt; &gt; that it is the &quot;one true way&quot;.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; However, many singers and flexible pitch instruments such as<br/>&gt; strings<br/>&gt; &gt; make quick, smooth pitch adjustments of this order of magnitude<br/>all<br/>&gt; &gt; the time, even when it is simply fixing an initial pitch error<br/>not<br/>&gt; &gt; justifiable as 7-limit or any other coherently related tuning.<br/>&gt; &gt; Consequently, I find it difficult to believe that in practice<br/>&gt; anyone<br/>&gt; &gt; would perceive a sustained 7th in 4:5:6:7 occurring over a<br/>dominant<br/>&gt; &gt; as objectional or being out of tune, or even melodically<br/>&gt; &gt; inappropriate unless they had some academic axe to grind.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Believe it.

This is what John deLaubenfels<br/>&gt; suggested. Did you have a specific reply to this, in your post that<br/>&gt; didn&apos;t get posted?<br/>&gt;<br/>Bob:<br/>I effectively answered you and John in a later post to which you<br/>responded. I have repeated that response (included above) within the<br/>last day and you also responded to that. I do not claim that my choir<br/>or even I always sing 4:5:6:7, expecially not when singing brief<br/>passing tone 7ths over V, but when it is sustanined, I already<br/>explained above in this post what happens.</p><p>Bob had said earlier:<br/>&gt; &gt; We should bear in mind always that the midi files with which we<br/>&gt; test<br/>&gt; &gt; some of our ideas with our ears are generally quite inflexible<br/>&gt; pitch-<br/>&gt; &gt; wise (excluding the adaptive JI software from JdL) and therefore<br/>do<br/>&gt; &gt; not represemt well what happens in practice with voices, strings,<br/>&gt; &gt; etc. For example, the comma problem that occurs when tuning first<br/>&gt; &gt; finger E on the D string of a violin to the open G and then to<br/>the<br/>&gt; &gt; open A in sequence does not generate anything like the same kind<br/>of<br/>&gt; &gt; melodic earthquake in practice with adaptive JI-oriented string<br/>&gt; &gt; playing as it does in a midi file. We&apos;ve already agreed on that.<br/>&gt;<br/>Paul had answered:<br/>&gt; Yes, and there was an adaptive version of I-IV-V7-I, with a 4:5:6:7<br/>&gt; dominant seventh, in which the septimal comma was distributed into<br/>&gt; three equal parts, among the three chord changes. This did not<br/>sound<br/>&gt; so bad melodically, though I still felt the 4:5:6:7 was lacking<br/>&gt; the &quot;tug&quot; toward the tonic that I like to hear in dominant seventh<br/>&gt; chords.<br/>&gt; &gt;</p><p>Bob had previously said:<br/>&gt; &gt; Further, I think you underestimate the attractive power of the<br/>7th<br/>&gt; &gt; harmonic in this context if this harmonic structure is sustained<br/>&gt; for<br/>&gt; &gt; any significant time. I have already explained how I have trained<br/>&gt; &gt; musically, and ESPECIALLY intonationally naive singers using<br/>&gt; &gt; exercises very explicitly based on the difference product<br/>&gt; phenomenon.<br/>&gt;<br/>Paul replied:<br/>&gt; I&apos;m a big fan of 7-limit harmony. I just don&apos;t hear the dominant<br/>&gt; seventh in common-practice tonal music as wanting this kind<br/>&gt; of &quot;consonance&quot;.</p><p>Bob:<br/>I do not find the low 7th of 7-limit over the V any more &quot;consonant&quot;<br/>in the sense of not wanting a resolution than I do a clean 15:16<br/>against a &quot;tonic&quot; drone in Indian classical music, for example. I<br/>think the 15:16 ratio is deliciously rich and beautiful in a harmonic<br/>sense and love it when the singers linger on it, but it wants<br/>resolution in a melodic sense. I feel the same about the low 7th.</p><p>Bob has previously said:<br/>&gt; &gt; (I have explained long ago that I think flexibly-pitched<br/>&gt; &gt; instrumentalists use this intuitively and usually unconsciously<br/>to<br/>&gt; &gt; tune harmony accurately. There is not time to do this with beats<br/>&gt; &gt; between common harmonics, since the beats are usually too slow<br/>&gt; unless<br/>&gt; &gt; we include huge pitch errors or very long notes.<br/>&gt;<br/>Paul:<br/>&gt; What do you mean? Beats between common harmonics, in 12-tET for<br/>&gt; example, tend to be very fast, for thirds and sixths. How do<br/>&gt; combinational tones allow for a faster reaction/adjustment time in<br/>&gt; acheiving good tuning than the process of eliminating beats?</p><p>12-tET is quite far off on the thirds, as you know. If you are<br/>wanting accurate JI and the note is short, there is no time for beats<br/>to tell<br/>you much. That&apos;s it. I&apos;m speaking from direct experience as a string<br/>player whose ear favors adaptive JI when free to do so. I don&apos;t<br/>listen for beats! But I can hear the difference tones INSTANTLY at<br/>any volume. It is this experience and my understanding of physical<br/>theory that lead me to the choral training techniques I use.<br/>&gt;</p><p>Bob had previously said:<br/>&gt; &gt; Also pitch training<br/>&gt; &gt; using the beat approach is terribly and demonstrably ineffective<br/>&gt; with<br/>&gt; &gt; amateurs when contrasted with the difference products approach<br/>&gt; except<br/>&gt; &gt; for unisons and octaves, in which case the beat phenomenon is<br/>&gt; easily<br/>&gt; &gt; detectable at the fundamental of both or one of the tones<br/>&gt; &gt; respectively and there are no difference products at frequencies<br/>&gt; not<br/>&gt; &gt; duplicating a fundamental.)<br/>&gt;<br/>Paul replied:<br/>&gt; Piano tuners are taught to listen for the beats of _all_ consonant<br/>&gt; intervals. &quot;Difference products&quot; (why do you use that term -- do<br/>you<br/>&gt; mean something different from combinational tones) are not used at<br/>&gt; all by piano tuners, though that may be due to the inharmonicity of<br/>&gt; piano strings.<br/>&gt;<br/>Bob answers:<br/>I have previously mentioned that my father was an expert piano tuner<br/>as well as a prodigiously talented classical musician and jazz<br/>improviser. He taught me to tune ET when I was in high school. I&apos;m<br/>intimately familiar with the beat phenomenon. Tuners don&apos;t use<br/>differential tones because they&apos;re only good for just intervals. I<br/>call them difference products because of my engineering bias and<br/>electronics background. That is technically what they are, partially<br/>generated by frequency mixing in the human ear, which has enough<br/>built-in non-linearity to produce difference products. There is also<br/>a significant neurological component, as you have reiterated, too.</p><p>Bob had previously said:<br/>&gt; &gt; This training initially involved only perfect fifths and fourths<br/>&gt; and<br/>&gt; &gt; major thirds. Yet once sensitivity to the presence of difference<br/>&gt; &gt; products was developed, it was spontaneously transferable to more<br/>&gt; &gt; complex harmonies, including a natural gravitation toward the 7th<br/>&gt; &gt; harmonic version of the V7 chord. It should be clear, therefore,<br/>&gt; that<br/>&gt; &gt; this is not based on a pre-conditioned preference specific to a<br/>&gt; &gt; particular harmonic structure, but a more general underlying<br/>&gt; &gt; psychoacoustic phenomenon to which the subjects in question had<br/>&gt; been<br/>&gt; &gt; senstizied, easily extensible to new harmonic experience, and<br/>that<br/>&gt; &gt; forms a highly significant and powerful component of the<br/>&gt; &gt; psychoacoustic phenomena at the very basis of the appeal of<br/>harmony<br/>&gt; &gt; in the first place.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Probably true, at least for singers singing in harmony, especially<br/>&gt; amateurs who never developed a strong inner intonational sense from<br/>a<br/>&gt; melodic basis.<br/>&gt;<br/>Bob has previouly said:<br/>&gt; &gt; As I&apos;ve stated previously, I have no good reason to believe that<br/>&gt; this<br/>&gt; &gt; phenomenon is peculiar to our time. Why would it be, and why<br/>would<br/>&gt; &gt; anyone want to propose that it is? To do so would defy any sense<br/>of<br/>&gt; &gt; theoretical economy, as would invoking other, less objectively<br/>&gt; &gt; verifiable explanations.</p><p>Paul replied:<br/>&gt; What do you have to say to those (like Margo) who claim that, in<br/>the<br/>&gt; days of Perotin, thirds, sixths, and triads tended to be sung in<br/>&gt; Pythagorean intonation, despite the gross violation of &quot;the very<br/>&gt; basis of the appeal of harmony&quot; as you see it?</p><p>Bob answers:<br/>How can they know what they actually did in flexibly-pitched vocal<br/>practice in a cappella performance?

This suggests that<br/>&gt; listeners compare melodic intervals to an abstract interval<br/>standard.<br/>&gt; Since Vos only used two-voice polyphonic settings, it is likely<br/>that<br/>&gt; his attempts to isolate preferences of harmony were partially<br/>&gt; undermined by melodic mistunings.&quot;<br/>&gt; (<a href="http://music.dartmouth.edu/~kov/lerdahl/tuningPaper.html">http://music.dartmouth.edu/~kov/lerdahl/tuningPaper.html</a>)</p><p>Bob comments:<br/>In those who do not specifically pay close attention to tuning<br/>harmonies (which represents the vast majority of singers, for<br/>example, in the common practice music of today), melodic habit is<br/>essentially all there is. Since it is quite common that keyboardists<br/>have no experience whatsoever with tuning, singers none with other<br/>than single tones in real-time performance, and even wind players<br/>only with the simple pulling in or out of a barrel for the sum total<br/>of theirs, large numbers of today&apos;s common practice musicians have no<br/>significant experience paying any really precise attention to tuning<br/>vertical harmonic structures.</p><p>In my view, this is all the cited study shows. It should not pretend<br/>to present a finding that qualifies as some kind of humanly intrinsic<br/>psychoacoustic tendency that applies across the board to<br/>considerations of harmonic vs. melodic integrity.</p><p>Paul also said:<br/>However, in progressions in which melodic guidance toward a goal is<br/>&gt; very powerful (such as where a tritone resolves by contrary<br/>semitones<br/>&gt; to a major third), I hear the melodic integrity of the voices as<br/>the<br/>&gt; stronger tuning consideration, and accept whatever vertical<br/>&gt; dissonance may occur as simply strengthening the drive toward<br/>&gt; resolution. THAT&apos;S THE FUNDAMENTAL AESTHETIC PREMISE UPON WHICH MY<br/>&gt; ARGUMENTS ARE BASED. My evidence is primarily based on my own<br/>&gt; experimentation and my own musical ear (which I consider my best<br/>&gt; feature).</p><p>That this observation reflects a valid component of historical<br/>realities in the perception of harmony is unquestionable. However, I<br/>take this in the context of fixed tunings as a cultural GIVEN<br/>provided by the theoretical constructs of the time. I don&apos;t think<br/>anyone here would disagree (?) that the thirds having been perceived<br/>in medieval times as dissonances that want to resolve outward to<br/>fifths or inward to unisons is a direct result of the complex<br/>relationship between the tones constituting thirds in Pythagorean<br/>tuning.</p><p>Neither do I disagree that the thin diatonic half-steps conditioned<br/>by Pythagorean tuning in the minds of the musicians of that era were<br/>melodically very compelling. It must have taken both time and<br/>something else pretty powerful to dislodge that conditioning and move<br/>harmonic evolution towared the pure and nearly pure thirds and the<br/>relatively quite fat diatonic half-steps of the mean-tone<br/>temperaments that predominated later.</p><p>However, I feel it important to distinguish between tuning dissonance<br/>and harmonically intrinsic dissonance. Aren&apos;t tuning dissonances like<br/>thirds in Pythagorean scales a historical circumstance that DO NOT<br/>necessarily represent some intrinsic NEED for such dissonance in<br/>order to drive harmonic progressions toward resolution?  Thirds tuned<br/>as 4:5 ratios certainly do not exhibit any such tendency, yet there<br/>are just intervals that beg for resolution with no such tuning<br/>dissonances involved.</p><p>In this light and that of my statement above, &quot;It must have taken<br/>both time and something else pretty powerful to dislodge that<br/>conditioning...&quot;, what was that &quot;something else pretty powerful&quot;? I<br/>propose it was the intrinsically attractive power of the 4:5 ratio in<br/>flexible-pitch polyphonic ensembles that drove the performers&apos; ears<br/>intuitively in this evolutionary direction.</p></div><h3><a id=28532 href="#28532">ðŸ”—</a>jpehrson@rcn.com</h3><span>9/24/2001 12:24:15 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In tuning@y..., BobWendell@t... wrote:</p><p><a href="/tuning/topicId_28224.html#28523">/tuning/topicId_28224.html#28523</a></p><p>&gt; Hi, Joseph!

I&apos;m no virtuoso on<br/>the violin and never have been even close, but that was always true<br/>for me personally as a string player, even though initially I had no<br/>intellectual basis for understanding the tendency.</p><p>I DO NOT mean to imply here that an 8:9 7th in the dominant is going<br/>to give way to a 7:8 7th in top level professionals! These are both<br/>just intervals! That the implied fundamental (and primary<br/>combinatorial tone) of the 8:9 interval falls on the 7th instead of<br/>the root is a fairly subtle difference, but I believe it explains why<br/>otherwise intonationally naive singers who have learned to savor just<br/>3rds, 4ths, and 5ths tend to gravitate toward 7:8 under sustained<br/>conditions.</p><p>I have stated elsewhere in these threads that a 7th as a brief<br/>passing tone over a dominant would not likely veer so low as 7:8,<br/>since melodic habit bids heavily against this. I believe we&apos;re all in<br/>agreement here! But I would bet that in a choral ensemble full of<br/>harmonically sensitive ears the sopranos would spontaneously tend to<br/>pick the low 7th on F in a sequence like this, where the bass G is a<br/>fourth under middle C:</p><p>S:  D E F - - - - - -   E<br/>A:  G - - - - - - - - - G<br/>T:  B - - - - - - - - - C<br/>B:  G - - - - - - - - - C</p><p>Here the primary (most audible) combinatorial tone between the alto<br/>and tenor B is the D a fourth below the bass, reinforcing two octaves<br/>lower the initial soprano fifth. The one between the Bass G and tenor<br/>B is the G two octaves below the bass, reinforcing the root.</p><p>The F at 8:9 would not fit harmonically poorly into this scheme,<br/>since the primary combinatorial tone with the alto G would fall on F<br/>three octaves below the sung one, but it&apos;s harmonically alien to the<br/>root and below it. On the other hand, the 7:8 version generates the<br/>primary combinatorial tone on G two octaves below the alto G, and<br/>also reinforcing the octave higher bass root.</p><p>Similarly, none of the other combinatorial tones 7:8 generates with<br/>the other tones of the chord are harmonically alien to the root. This<br/>fits much more neatly to the ear harmonically and its proximity to<br/>the E begs for resolution, since the MELODIC interval is<br/>chromatically thin.</p><p>--- In tuning@y..., Afmmjr@a... wrote:<br/>&gt; In a message dated 9/21/01 4:05:27 PM Eastern Daylight Time,<br/>&gt; BobWendell@t... writes:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; Such thinking would assume that melodic memory (not in the sense<br/>of<br/>&gt; &gt; &quot;carrying a tune&quot;, but in the precise sense of exact imitation<br/>with<br/>&gt; &gt; microtonal accuracy) is more compelling than the appeal to the<br/>human<br/>&gt; &gt; ear of harmonic consonance. Maybe some rare human beings had<br/>&gt; &gt; developed such a microtonally precise melodic memory (Johnny<br/>Reinhard<br/>&gt; &gt; comes to mind), but that would be highly exceptional and<br/>certainly<br/>&gt; &gt; not the norm.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; But the highest level professionals are not the norm.  Neither was<br/>J.S. Bach<br/>&gt; the norm.  I remember Odetta (also not the norm) rehearsing for<br/>hours before<br/>&gt; her performance on an AFMM concert on May 14, 1988.  She had what<br/>might best<br/>&gt; be called &quot;etched&quot; intervals for &quot;God&apos;s Gonna Cut You Down&quot; and<br/>&quot;Black Woman&quot;<br/>&gt; that had an exact placement in her mind, and it was repeatable...if<br/>she<br/>&gt; practiced.  (I do have recordings of 2 different performances on<br/>the same day<br/>&gt; and they could be contrasted.) Odetta would have been Harry<br/>Partch&apos;s ideal<br/>&gt; vocalist, and he would have preferred her instead of many a male<br/>part (or so<br/>&gt; he said in a letter).<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Bach was a chromaticist each time he used all 12 notes in a piece<br/>(which was<br/>&gt; pretty often).  The etched sound of Werckmeister&apos;s scales are exact<br/>in<br/>&gt; character based on key, as if one went back into time.  This is one<br/>of the<br/>&gt; very few cases where one can have certainty with a composer&apos;s<br/>tuning.  At<br/>&gt; least if one comes to believe that Werckmeister&apos;s tuning is Bach&apos;s,<br/>then<br/>&gt; there is a one-cent exactness or better to each note.  It is not<br/>much of a<br/>&gt; leap to suggest that the melodic traditions that Bach inherited<br/>were well<br/>&gt; served by an exact set of 12 major and minor keys which were<br/>&quot;exactly&quot;<br/>&gt; different.  Such wonders could be achieved, all quite mastered by<br/>the highly<br/>&gt; exceptional.  An exceptional, like Bach, could influence<br/>tremendously the<br/>&gt; performance results of others, as does Bob.  When only one person<br/>hears it,<br/>&gt; others can achieve, too.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Consider, anyone who can believe in any of a number of &quot;odd/West<br/>tunings&quot;<br/>&gt; would have to believe that one &quot;could&quot; believe most any set of<br/>tones or<br/>&gt; sounds as legitimate, even reproducible.  Why allow a modern<br/>comfort zone<br/>&gt; with just intonation to set a standard for music of strangers?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Johnny Reinhard<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Johnny Reinhard</p></div><h3><a id=28552 href="#28552">ðŸ”—</a>Paul Erlich &#x3C;paul@stretch-music.com&#x3E;</h3><span>9/24/2001 1:17:15 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In tuning@y..., BobWendell@t... wrote:</p><p>&gt; However, I feel it important to distinguish between tuning<br/>dissonance<br/>&gt; and harmonically intrinsic dissonance.

Thanks for your query. We do not sharpen the leading tone,<br/>at least not consistently and with any intention to do so. (My choir<br/>is not intonationally so perfect and consistent as your numbers might<br/>imply.)</p><p>First, the syntonic shift in your D above and the septimal comma<br/>shift downward in the F are not compensated in any rigorous way in<br/>our practice. I simply train members to prefer just tunings, mainly<br/>on fourths, fifths and major thirds, and leave the rest to intuition.<br/>Since we also work on pitch stability, not in any locally rigorous<br/>way, but simply, generally entertain the goal of ending up on the<br/>same pitch base as we started, harmonic drift is eliminate by subtle,<br/>unconscious adaptive JI &quot;fudging&quot; that is mostly melodic, since too<br/>much fudging harmonically destroys the justness of JI harmony.</p><p>I find that most people, even highly trained common practice<br/>musicians, do not perceive easily and are not bothered by microtonal<br/>MELODIC shifts well-disguised by the fudging that occurs in adaptive<br/>JI by flexibly pitched performers. There is a habit pattern of<br/>perceiving anything substantially less than chromatic half-steps as<br/>the &quot;same&quot; pitch when the ear is accustomed to perceiving<br/>diatonically and even in terms of conventional harmonic chromaticism.<br/>Typical common practice pitch errors among flexibly pitched<br/>performers such as singers are of this order of magnitude or greater<br/>anyway.</p><p>I find that most common practice musicians in this area are incapable<br/>of pinpointing the source of the &quot;professional&quot; sound they attribute<br/>to our ensemble.
