All software (or all software that lasts in<br/>&gt; the market) goes through changes and upgrades in response<br/>&gt; to either real or perceived consumer desires. Finale has been<br/>&gt; bitten pretty well by other notation programs, most notably<br/>&gt; Sibelius; this is the reason they&apos;ve had so many promotions.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; And having worked with Finale in some of it&apos;s earliest forms,<br/>&gt; and then more recently (my last work with Finale was about<br/>&gt; 1.5 years ago), they had made a lot of improvements in useability.<br/>&gt; I&apos;m not conjecturing that it is as good/easy/transparent an<br/>&gt; interface as Sibelius, just that it may have come closer.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Bottom line: if we&apos;re discussing software (especially in comparison)<br/>&gt; it only serves its purpose if we discuss the most current versions.<br/>&gt; The features one is missing may very well be there if you are using<br/>&gt; an old version for your baseline.</p><p>very good point.  i actually have used Finale only very little<br/>since the last time i did a lot of work on my book (1998), generally<br/>only when i need a musical illustration for a webpage.</p><p>these days, i&apos;m using a version which i downloaded for free<br/>from somewhere in 2000.  the version i know better is the original<br/>one i purchased, back around 1997.</p><p>as i said, i perceive the biggest hassle to be that any accidentals<br/>may be created for Finale, but they can only specify deviations<br/>from 12edo.  if an app or a plug-in can be created which bases<br/>the accidentals on Pythagorean tuning, as they evolved historically,<br/>that would provide a much more elegant method for the implementation<br/>of JI-specific accidental symbols.</p><p>-monz</p></div><h3>monz &#x3C;monz@attglobal.net&#x3E;</h3><span>11/27/2002 1:12:14 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>hi Joe,</p><p>&gt; From: &quot;Joseph Pehrson&quot; &lt;<a href="mailto:jpehrson@rcn.com">jpehrson@rcn.com</a>&gt;<br/>&gt; To: &lt;<a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>&gt;<br/>&gt; Sent: Wednesday, November 27, 2002 7:33 AM<br/>&gt; Subject: [tuning] Re: microtonal accidentals in Finale<br/>&gt;</p><p>&gt; --- In tuning@y..., &quot;monz&quot; &lt;monz@a...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; <a href="http://groups.yahoo.com/group/tuning/message/41223">http://groups.yahoo.com/group/tuning/message/41223</a><br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; anyway, getting back to the main reason why i personally<br/>&gt; &gt; never pursued microtonal accidentals in Finale: my understanding<br/>&gt; &gt; of how Finale does microtonality is that you have to set up<br/>&gt; &gt; the accidentals to make adjustments relative to 12edo.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; ***Hi Monz!<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; But isn&apos;t this just as much due to the nature of the MIDI spec. as<br/>&gt; anything?

From what I can tell, there is no universal<br/>musical notation system out there that really works<br/>for most of us. It seems that all that would be<br/>necessary is to find a good traditional notation<br/>program, then hire a programmer to customize that<br/>program for generalized microtonal notation. The best<br/>system seems to be the &quot;cents&quot; notation advocated by<br/>Johnny Reinhard, because it gives the pitches accurate<br/>to within 1/100th of a traditional half-step and is<br/>practical for performing musicians. I know a<br/>programmer who claims he can do this on Cakewalk, at<br/>least. Not the greatest notation program but<br/>functional. He may be willing to research and develop<br/>a customized &quot;piggyback&quot; notation program for Finale<br/>or Sibelius, I&apos;d have to ask. If we can find ten<br/>people to go in on the cost of it, maybe we can get a<br/>real, practical, user-friendly (or at least<br/>user-tolerant) notational program for almost all of<br/>us!<br/>Any potential takers?<br/>Chris Mohr</p><p>--- monz &lt;<a href="mailto:monz@attglobal.net">monz@attglobal.net</a>&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt; hi Joe,<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; From: &quot;Joseph Pehrson&quot; &lt;<a href="mailto:jpehrson@rcn.com">jpehrson@rcn.com</a>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; To: &lt;<a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; Sent: Wednesday, November 27, 2002 7:33 AM<br/>&gt; &gt; Subject: [tuning] Re: microtonal accidentals in<br/>&gt; Finale<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; --- In tuning@y..., &quot;monz&quot; &lt;monz@a...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; <a href="http://groups.yahoo.com/group/tuning/message/41223">http://groups.yahoo.com/group/tuning/message/41223</a><br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; anyway, getting back to the main reason why i<br/>&gt; personally<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; never pursued microtonal accidentals in Finale:<br/>&gt; my understanding<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; of how Finale does microtonality is that you<br/>&gt; have to set up<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; the accidentals to make adjustments relative to<br/>&gt; 12edo.<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; ***Hi Monz!<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; But isn&apos;t this just as much due to the nature of<br/>&gt; the MIDI spec. as<br/>&gt; &gt; anything?
