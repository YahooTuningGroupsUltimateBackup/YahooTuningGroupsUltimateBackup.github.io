Interesting site.</p><p>Interesting ideas about virtual melody in<br/><a href="http://www.mmk.ei.tum.de/persons/ter/top/basse.html">http://www.mmk.ei.tum.de/persons/ter/top/basse.html</a><br/>So, I wonder if one can also get a virtual melody using inharmonic<br/>timbres - I&apos;m asking if one can add to this idea, rather than trying<br/>to refute it!</p><p>Maybe some percussion sounds do use noise, but a fair number<br/>have clear partials, as do bells (modern church bell is<br/>tuned, to bring the partials into consonance, but others aren&apos;t).</p><p>The idea of the experiment was to make an _inharmonic_ timbre with<br/>a number of clear partials, with one of them strong, as<br/>is the case for most _harmonic_ timbres.</p><p>Then get used to that timbre.</p><p>After some listening of that, try anothr timbre with all the<br/>other identical partials to that one, but leaving out the strong partial.</p><p>I.e.</p><p>Timbre 1<br/>partials R S T U V</p><p>S say is very strong</p><p>Timbre 2<br/>partials R S&apos; T U V</p><p>S&apos; is an octave below S, and somewhat quieter, so that now, say,<br/>T is the strongest of the remaining partials.</p><p>Connection with bells is that bells often don&apos;t have any partial<br/>corresponding to the perceived pitch, but instead have a partial an<br/>octave below it, which seems to help to lead the ear to the exact<br/>perceived pitch of the note.</p><p>Now idea is, after repeatedly listening and working with timbre 1,<br/>play timbre 2. Does one hear the pitch as S?</p><p>The hypothesis to test is that one will.</p><p>However, that by itself isn&apos;t sufficiently convincing, as if it works,<br/>one could always suggest that it is the harmonic series that is somehow<br/>involved in it.</p><p>So next, find someone who has never heard timbre 1. Ask them to<br/>try out Timbre 2.</p><p>Do they hear the pitch of Timbre 2 as S, or perhaps as T?</p><p>I&apos;d probably be able to set it up in FTS come to think of it,<br/>using MIDI for the partials. Then one could try playing in the<br/>two timbres - that interactivity could help one to focus more<br/>on the pitch of the timbre.</p><p>One might get a percentage type answer - 70% hear the pitch of<br/>Timbre 2 as S, say, or that 70% of the time a given listener<br/>will hear it as S.</p><p>Robert</p></div><h3><a id=20852 href="#20852">ðŸ”—</a>Paul H.
