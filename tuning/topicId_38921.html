But instead of the 81/80 comma being used, I used the schisma,<br/>32805/32768, as well as the septimal schismaThe first scale is based on a<br/>tempering of 1/8 of a schisma. The fifth is 2/10^(1/8) (two divided by the<br/>eighth root of 10), or ~701.71079 cents. The second is based on 1/14 of a<br/>septimal schisma. The fifth is 2/56^(1/14) (two divided by the fourteenth root<br/>of 56), or ~702.22672 cents.A third scale, based on the geometric mean of both<br/>intervals (the square root of the first interval times the second), has a fifth<br/>of ~701.96875. Compare to the Pythagorean fifth (3/2), about ~701.95500 cents.<br/>The difference is obviously quite tiny.The use of a mean could also be applied<br/>to comma-based meantones. An example is the mean of the fifth in 1/4-comma<br/>meantone and the fifth in 1/2-septimal comma meantone, which is the arithmetic<br/>mean of ~696.57843&#xFFFD; and ~688.32295&#xFFFD;, or ~692.45069&#xFFFD;. Ultimately the means of<br/>many prime-number commas could be used.~Danny~</p><p>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p>MSN Photos is the easiest way to share and print your photos: Click Here<br/>[<a href="http://g.msn.com/1HM1ENUS/c156">http://g.msn.com/1HM1ENUS/c156</a>??PI=44364]</p></div><h3>Danny Wier &#x3C;dawier@hotmail.com&#x3E;</h3><span>9/5/2002 7:14:05 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'>undefined</div><h3>Danny Wier &#x3C;dawier@hotmail.com&#x3E;</h3><span>9/5/2002 7:29:33 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'>undefined</div>
