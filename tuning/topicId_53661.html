Can we hear it?<br/>   I&apos;ll find somewhere to upload the mp3&apos;s when I get back to Bowling Green  -- I&apos;m in Minneapolis visiting a friend for Twin Cities Pride this week (and to escape the rampant conservatism of Ohio...)  I have the &quot;Partch Chorale&quot; mp3, as well as a more modern piece I wrote for a project in a Music Technology class which is entirely in the Monophonic Fabric (&quot;Smooth Ride in a Fine-Tuned MAChine&quot;). &gt; When you say &quot;1/4-comma meantone&quot;, were you using a 12-tone subset of<br/>&gt; this temperament, or a 19-tone one, or...?<br/>The 12-tone version, starting the chain of 3;2&apos;s on E-flat and ending on G-sharp.  I had assumed, since it was a one-to-one conversion of scale step to scale step, that all I had to do was have Scala retune the MIDI file with that scale loaded.  So, I fed in an original MIDI file of &quot;Es ist genug&quot; (not my Partch version)... and what came out was NOT meantone in the least, and I couldn&apos;t hear any rhyme or reason to how the pitches were bending.  I thought perhaps the bend range was set wrong, so I messed around with some of the preferences in the program, but the results always ended up pretty similar... and incorrect.<br/>Is there some special keyboard map I have to load in/create?  My eventual goal was to create a mapping for MIDI notes onto the Monophonic Fabric, and then simply create a MIDI file in a sequencer somewhere else and import it.  But, after my smash hit with the meantone attempt, I decided not. If anyone knows how to do the meantone version in Scala, at least, I&apos;d love to hear it...I&apos;m sure I must be doing something stupid.  :-) Eric</p></div><h3>Carl Lumma &#x3C;ekin@lumma.org&#x3E;</h3><span>6/23/2004 4:09:37 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>&gt;I just brought up Baroque since it seems to me the first point in<br/>&gt;Music History where the concepts of &quot;major&quot; and &quot;minor&quot; really<br/>&gt;began to stabilize themselves.</p><p>The genesis of tonal music started not long before the Baroque<br/>period.</p><p>&gt;&gt;&gt;For example, I recently wrote a chorale in six voices based<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt;on Bach&apos;s &quot;Es ist genug&quot; where the principal harmonies are<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt;subsets of Otonalities and Utonalities within the Monophonic<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt;Fabric,<br/>&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt;Sounds AWESOME.
