It is a *good* thing that csound came along for you!</p><p>{you wrote...}<br/>&gt;   (now looking for sources of Partch recordings)</p><p>Well, ahem, you might try:<br/><a href="http://www.corporeal.com/freshpix.html">http://www.corporeal.com/freshpix.html</a></p><p>...which should get you everything you would need. If you want hints on best listening for your particular tastes, I will be happy to make (off-list) recommendations. That said, it may very well be that none of Partch&apos;s music will be to your liking. Again, no reason for Harry to apologize about that...</p><p>Cheers,<br/>Jon</p><p>&grave;&apos;&grave;&apos;&grave;&apos;&grave;&apos;&grave;&apos;&grave;&apos;&grave;&apos;&grave;&apos;&grave;&apos;&grave;&apos;&grave;&apos;&grave;&apos;&grave;&apos;&grave;&apos;&grave;&apos;&grave;&apos;&grave;&apos;&grave;&apos;&grave;&apos;&grave;&apos;&grave;&apos;&grave;&apos;&grave;&apos;&grave;&apos;&grave;&apos;&grave;<br/>Real Life: Orchestral Percussionist<br/>Web Life: &quot;Corporeal Meadows&quot; - about Harry Partch<br/>                         <a href="http://www.corporeal.com/">http://www.corporeal.com/</a></p></div>
