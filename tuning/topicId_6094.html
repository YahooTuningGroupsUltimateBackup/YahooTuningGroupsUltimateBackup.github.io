As for<br/>&gt; Pythagoreanism, I would define any tuning system by fifths (and/or<br/>&gt; fourths) and octaves as basically pythagorean in the absence of any<br/>&gt; data on tempering or tweaking to get better consonances.[...]</p><p>Here I would say that it is very tempting for me to overlook the fact<br/>that we are indeed talking about Babylon in the 2nd millennium BCE,<br/>not Western Europe in roughly the first four-tenths of the 2nd<br/>millennium CE. In the latter context, I could eloquently advocate a<br/>pure Pythagorean tuning, just as someone focusing on a different<br/>context could advocate &quot;tempering&quot; toward 5-limit just intonation<br/>(JI), or maybe &quot;tweaking&quot; toward Javanese _slendro_ (near 5-tone equal<br/>temperament, or 5-tet).</p><p>Unless we have some idea of Babylonian music, it seems an exercise<br/>either in guessing, or possibly in ethnocentricism of one&apos;s favorite<br/>flavor.</p><p>Here are a few &quot;ifs&quot; which might reflect my own European medievalist<br/>leanings.</p><p>If Babylonian music were mainly monophonic, then the Pythagorean<br/>whole-tone of 9:8 (generously wide) and semitone of 256:253 (neatly<br/>compact) might be fine without any reason for &quot;tweaking.&quot;</p><p>If Babylonian music featured polyphony based mainly on fifths and<br/>fourths, then vertical as well as melodic considerations might favor<br/>Pythagorean, as in most recorded polyphony of medieval Europe. If<br/>other vertical intervals are incidental, they may give little reason<br/>for complicating the tuning. If such interval (including thirds and<br/>sixths) are used in unstable sonorities contrasting with stable ones<br/>featuring fifths and fourths, then their tension may be a positive<br/>feature.</p><p>If Babylonian music sometimes used vertical thirds as restful<br/>intervals, then either actual 5-limit intervals or Pythagorean schisma<br/>thirds might serve such a music. Here the system of _srutis_ in India<br/>might serve as a precedent, and some people suggest that this system<br/>(including a 5:4) maybe have evolved from a Pythagorean tuning with<br/>schisma intervals.</p><p>&gt; Taken literally, the Babylonians seemed to check their tuning by<br/>&gt; listening to the thirds or sixths. I don&apos;t find it unbelievable that<br/>&gt; they considered the pythagorean intervals to the be the norm rather<br/>&gt; than the 5-limit ones we might prefer. (comments?, Margo)</p><p>As someone who prefers Pythagorean for most Gothic music but 5-limit<br/>(or its keyboard approximation of meantone) for Renaissance music, my<br/>first reaction might be, &quot;it depends on the kind of music being<br/>performed -- for me, at any rate, and possibly for the ancient<br/>Babylonians also.&quot;</p><p>The idea of tuning a Pythagorean instrument by listening to thirds and<br/>sixths could be maybe a bit analogous to tuning Renaisance meantone by<br/>listening to the fifths or fourths. It&apos;s an intriguing idea, and I&apos;d<br/>be curious about the sources and translations; musically, why not?</p><p>Anyway, thank you for this discussion on a topic that raises lots of<br/>questions both about history itself and about its possible<br/>interpretations.</p><p>Most appreciatively,</p><p>Margo Schulter<br/><a href="mailto:mschulter@value.net">mschulter@value.net</a></p></div>
