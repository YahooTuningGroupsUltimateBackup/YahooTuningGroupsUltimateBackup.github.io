Although I agree heartily that the harmonic language of the<br/>Baroque and Classical eras was profoundly determined by the resources of<br/>meantone, there are important exception. Tartini, who emphasized purity of<br/>intervals, tuned to difference tones, and recognized the 7th partial, is one.<br/> But if the question is limited to music with keyboard instruments, then the<br/>only possible example of a seven-limit interval in practice would be chords<br/>of the augmented sixth.</p></div>
