I&apos;m assuming this only affects midi tracks, but with some of the new audio pitch shifting technologies such as the new pitch correction plug in in logic it makes me wonder.  Is it indeed only midi or does it have the capability to tune audio tracks as well, maybe working in conjunction with the new plug in?</p><p>Matthew</p></div>
