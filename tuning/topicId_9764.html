I don&apos;t know if he meant that they would<br/>do<br/>&gt;this when playing exclusively with other strings or whether they would<br/>do<br/>&gt;it only in the presence of an instrument of fixed pitch. Do you know<br/>&gt;anything about this?</p><p>&gt;John Link</p><p>Provided you set your A at 4440 Hz, this makes total sense to me.<br/>Tuning the fifths slightly (say 4.5 cents flat) is all you need to do to<br/>LucyTune a cello.<br/>Then the player adjusts the fingering positions for the appropriate<br/>pitches to be sounded.</p><p>see <a href="http://www.ilhawaii.net/~lucy/">http://www.ilhawaii.net/~lucy/</a></p><p>2. &gt;Tuning Dump for what?  Please expound.</p><p>&gt;DBurgess</p><p>The midi tuning dump is the protocol used to map, store and transfer<br/>individual note tunings between instruments<br/>e. g. Proteus etc. Yet as far as I know, no existing midi instruments<br/>will play the tunings any closer than 1/64th of a semitone. The<br/>resolution of the tuning dump is specified to the nearest 1/16384th of a<br/>semitone.<br/>The accuracy of the tuning is particularly significant to generate more<br/>precise beat frequencies between simultaneously sounded notes.</p><p>see <a href="http://lehua.ilhawaii.net/~lucy/lsd/pitchbend.html">http://lehua.ilhawaii.net/~lucy/lsd/pitchbend.html</a></p><p>3.  &gt;A guitar hard-fretted in a given meantone would kind<br/>&gt;of limit the pieces you could play, unless of course what you wanted to<br/>do<br/>&gt;was make up your own.</p><p>&gt;Dante.</p><p>Think a little further Dante - the contrary is the case.<br/>It enables you to play any 12tET piece as notated, plus a multitude of<br/>other alternative renditions, and microtonal alternatives.<br/>Using meantone enables you to paint beyond the limited 12tET and JI<br/>palettes.</p><p>Check out <a href="http://www.ilhawaii.net/~lucy/lsd/chap1.html">http://www.ilhawaii.net/~lucy/lsd/chap1.html</a></p><p>--<br/>~====================================================~<br/>Charles Lucy - <a href="mailto:lucy@ilhawaii.net">lucy@ilhawaii.net</a>  (LucyScaleDevelopments)<br/>------------  Promoting global harmony through LucyTuning  -------<br/>by setting tuning and harmonic standards and having fun with them.</p><p>for information on LucyTuning and to get your free LucyTuned Lullaby<br/>mp3&apos;s<br/>go to <a href="http://www.ilhawaii.net/~lucy">http://www.ilhawaii.net/~lucy</a>  or <a href="http://www.harmonics.com/lucy/">http://www.harmonics.com/lucy/</a><br/>        or <a href="http://www.lucytune.co.uk">http://www.lucytune.co.uk</a> or <a href="http://www.lucytune.com">http://www.lucytune.com</a></p></div>
