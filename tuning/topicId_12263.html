An answer to the<br/>above question depends on exactly which interval is desired on which<br/>instrument.</p><p>Since all players have used tuning machines with arrows at &quot;0&quot; to indicate a<br/>targeted pitch (usually a 12-TET designated note), being out of tune in<br/>either direction is quickly evaluated and corrected.  However, memory of 5<br/>cents out of tune or 10 cents out of tune develops a physical feel and<br/>sensibility.  An eighthtone can be learned as the half of the pedestrian<br/>quartertone.  Fingerings aid in memory of pitch placement.  Frankly, a<br/>quartertone is small enough that a musician can discover its splits into<br/>different slivers quite easily once proper attention is paid.</p><p>Believe me, AFMM musicians pay attention.</p><p>Johnny Reinhard</p></div><h3><a id=12280 href="#12280">ðŸ”—</a>Monz &#x3C;MONZ@JUNO.COM&#x3E;</h3><span>9/3/2000 11:31:07 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>&gt; [Johnny Reinhard]<br/>&gt; <a href="http://www.egroups.com/message/tuning/12273">http://www.egroups.com/message/tuning/12273</a><br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Frankly, a quartertone is small enough that a musician can<br/>&gt; discover its splits into different slivers quite easily once<br/>&gt; proper attention is paid.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Believe me, AFMM musicians pay attention.</p><p>Thank you, Johnny, for delivering more eloquently than I<br/>the defense for 24-tET *notation* that I&apos;ve tried to present<br/>here.</p><p>(Never mind its inconsistencies as a tuning...)</p><p>I, too, believe that any other tuning system can be coaxed<br/>out of an ensemble of good players with as simply a notation<br/>as 24-tET.
