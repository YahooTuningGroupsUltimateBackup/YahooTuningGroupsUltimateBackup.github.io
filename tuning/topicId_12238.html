This<br/>range is then multiplied by the height of the Gaussian (with standard<br/>deviation s and centered around the true interval) at the ratio. This<br/>gives a probability value (p) to each ratio, and the sum of these<br/>probabilities should be 1. Then the harmonic entropy of the true<br/>interval is: -sum(p*log(p)), where the sum runs over all the ratios<br/>in<br/>the Farey (or whatever) series.</p></div><h3><a id=12249 href="#12249">ðŸ”—</a>Monz &#x3C;MONZ@JUNO.COM&#x3E;</h3><span>9/3/2000 12:39:40 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>&gt; [Keenan Pepper]<br/>&gt; <a href="http://www.egroups.com/message/tuning/12238">http://www.egroups.com/message/tuning/12238</a><br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; ...

First I wanted to tell you how impressed I am<br/>that at your young age, you can grasp so much of some really<br/>complex tuning theory.</p><p>When I visited Paul Erlich last year, he explained his &apos;harmonic<br/>entropy&apos; postings to me in greater detail (which is what led<br/>to my creation of the webpages), and he showed me a graph he&apos;d<br/>made where s = 0.6%.  It was interesting to see the difference<br/>from s = 1%, and you have indeed understood precisely how s works<br/>in the calculation: it is a measure of how finely a listener can<br/>discriminate discreet pitches.</p><p>&gt; P.S. Could someone give me the actual formula for harmonic<br/>&gt; entropy, so I won&apos;t have to bother the List with my inane<br/>&gt; requests? A have a hunch it uses a Gaussian distrbution around<br/>&gt; each ratio, but I&apos;m not sure how.</p><p>Paul is your man, Keenan - this whole concept was formulated<br/>by him.  You&apos;re right about the Gaussian distribution, but I<br/>could never explain it to you.

But I&apos;m having a bit of trouble<br/>correlating some of the entropy dips with my perception of interval<br/>concordance.</p><p>Compare, for example, 5/4 and 4/3 from the first octave, to their<br/>counterparts, 5/2 and 8/3, in the second octave.  The curve shows 4/3<br/>as having less entropy then 5/4, but 8/3 as having more entropy than<br/>5/2.  What does this mean?</p><p>When I think of relating the harmonic entropy curve to actual tuning,<br/>my first thought would be to match higher entropy with higher tuning<br/>&quot;pain&quot;.  Your own recent scale-finding posts attempt to minimize total<br/>entropy, in alignment with this correlation.  But this leads to the<br/>following (correct me if I&apos;m wrong): places with deeper entropy dips,<br/>such as 5/2 vs. 8/3, would need to be tuned closer to JI than ones with<br/>less pronounced dips.  The slope of the entropy curve is equivalent to<br/>the spring constant (I should say &quot;constant&quot; because it changes) in my<br/>energy model, d(pain)/d(tuning).</p><p>Does this really make tuning sense?  That is, is it more important to<br/>tune 4/3 close to true than 5/4, yet LESS important to tune 8/3 close<br/>to true than 5/2?</p><p>JdL</p></div><h3><a id=12349 href="#12349">ðŸ”—</a>John A. deLaubenfels &#x3C;jdl@adaptune.com&#x3E;</h3><span>9/5/2000 7:21:48 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>[I wrote:]<br/>&gt;The slope of the entropy curve is equivalent to<br/>&gt;the spring constant (I should say &quot;constant&quot; because it changes) in my<br/>&gt;energy model, d(pain)/d(tuning).</p><p>which is a muddle of my own model!
