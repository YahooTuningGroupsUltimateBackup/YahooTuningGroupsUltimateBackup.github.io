I haven&apos;t found a way of<br/>&gt; &gt; &apos;doing&apos; microtonal music with Sibelius though programmers can write<br/>&gt; their own 3rd party bits. If<br/>&gt; &gt; anyone has succeeded I&apos;d love to know about it. On the other hand<br/>&gt; as a notation programme Sibelius<br/>&gt; &gt; is excellent.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; Regards.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Hello Allison!<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; The gentleman (sales rep) who demonstrated this program at the<br/>&gt; American Music Center was talking about some feature where one could<br/>&gt; type in &quot;cents deviation&quot; from the standard written pitches<br/>&gt; someplace, and it would come out with the right pitch bends when<br/>&gt; these pieces were played back in Scorch.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Did you see anything of this nature in the manual??<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Thanks!<br/>&gt;</p><p>Hi, Joseph</p><p>There is something in the manual about pitch bend. Basically you can send MIDI commands to<br/>Sibelius by typing them in as text which you append (and hide) in the score. There is  fine<br/>pitchbend (0-255) and coarse pitchbend (0-63). You type in your pitchbend message as two numbers<br/>preceded by B. So, B0,0 is as low as possible, B0,32 is normal and B255,63 is as high as possible.<br/>I suppose you could work out cent equivalents, which is perhaps what the rep meant. Unless there<br/>is a plug-in to facilitate the conversion.</p><p>I don&apos;t use the feature as I only use Sibelius for notation and playback of my choral work.<br/>Besides my brains are mince from trying to understand Blackjack and other topics.</p><p>Kind Regards</p></div><h3><a id=29444 href="#29444">ðŸ”—</a>Paul Erlich &#x3C;paul@stretch-music.com&#x3E;</h3><span>10/23/2001 2:17:05 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In tuning@y..., Alison Monteith &lt;alison.monteith3@w...&gt; wrote:</p><p>&gt; Besides my brains are mince from trying to understand Blackjack and<br/>other topics.</p><p>The best way to understand Blackjack is with Dave Keenan&apos;s slide<br/>rules.

In<br/>particular the 24 tet plug-in, which I&apos;m sure is a midi message affair, was very poor. This might<br/>be down to my Mac soundcard, but then it&apos;s probably as good as most soundcards around.</p><p>Another feature is the ability to design your own symbols. You could discover a new comma and<br/>design a symbol for it.</p><p>Best Wishes.</p></div><h3><a id=29610 href="#29610">ðŸ”—</a>manuel.op.de.coul@eon-benelux.com</h3><span>10/26/2001 3:00:35 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Here&apos;s another person&apos;s opinion:<br/><a href="http://www.tgtools.de/finsib.htm">http://www.tgtools.de/finsib.htm</a></p><p>Manuel</p></div><h3><a id=29637 href="#29637">ðŸ”—</a>jpehrson@rcn.com</h3><span>10/26/2001 1:05:27 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In tuning@y..., &lt;manuel.op.de.coul@e...&gt; wrote:</p><p><a href="/tuning/topicId_29429.html#29610">/tuning/topicId_29429.html#29610</a></p><p>&gt;<br/>&gt; Here&apos;s another person&apos;s opinion:<br/>&gt; <a href="http://www.tgtools.de/finsib.htm">http://www.tgtools.de/finsib.htm</a><br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Manuel</p><p>Note, however, that this is on a, specifically, Finale website!</p><p>________ _______ ________<br/>Joseph Pehrson</p></div>
