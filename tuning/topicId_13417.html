I *was* enjoying the Smithy,<br/>but I realized I needed it to do simple things, like play Scala files<br/>slowly, ascending, so I could get a &quot;feel&quot; for them before the<br/>&quot;Fractal&quot; experiments &quot;kicked in.&quot;  Actually, I do believe Carl Lumma<br/>was right, the more I think about it.  I was trying to get the<br/>application to do things it basically is not designed to do.  I&apos;m<br/>finding that Graham Breed&apos;s MIDI RELAY is really doing more this job<br/>for me...</p><p>However, it might be nice to have such simple functions incorporated<br/>into Fractal Tune Smithy... it seems a tad difficult to get it to<br/>give these basic scale &quot;appraisals.&quot;</p><p>Anyway, good luck with it... and I did enjoy &quot;messing around&quot; with my<br/>copy...</p><p>Best,</p><p>________ ___ __ ___ _<br/>Joseph Pehrson</p></div><h3><a id=13441 href="#13441">ðŸ”—</a>Robert Walker &#x3C;robert_walker@rcwalker.freeserve.co.uk&#x3E;</h3><span>9/23/2000 10:10:13 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>&gt;However, it might be nice to have such simple functions incorporated<br/>&gt;into Fractal Tune Smithy... it seems a tad difficult to get it to<br/>&gt;give these basic scale &quot;appraisals.&quot;</p><p>&gt;Anyway, good luck with it... and I did enjoy &quot;messing around&quot; with my<br/>&gt;copy...</p><p>Right, I&apos;ll give it some thought.
