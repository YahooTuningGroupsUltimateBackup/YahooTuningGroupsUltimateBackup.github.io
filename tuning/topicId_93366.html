However, in the case of<br/>&quot;fur elise&quot;, for example, it goes &quot;too far&quot; in my opinion...it goes from an<br/>&quot;upbeat&quot; minor piece to an almost silly/corny/circus-like happy major<br/>piece...and thus creates a different sense of pain/&quot;lack of relaxation&quot;.  Kind<br/>of a musical equivalent to being caught at a frat party passed out on a couch<br/>with someone drawing a Sharpie marker mustache in your face. :-D  Meanwhile, in<br/>contrast, &quot;Star Spangled Banner&quot;, an already serious sounding song, making it<br/>minor makes it so serious it really does sound incredibly unsettling.</p><p>   From these examples at least, it seems fair to say minor does sound more sad,<br/>but not necessarily less relaxed.<br/>  My experience in writing electronic music says much the same...when you make<br/>something sound &quot;too upbeat&quot;, it all turns into a sort of happy confusion...more<br/>jumpy and corny than relaxing.</p><p>   So, to my ears, making a song in minor form makes it &quot;more sad&quot;.  If the<br/>actual composition is upbeat/happy enough...the result will still sound happy in<br/>a minor key.  What seems to make it un-relaxing to me is how far off the deep<br/>end the overall song construction + key used is: if it&apos;s too happy or too sad it<br/>becomes &quot;unsettling&quot;.</p></div><h3><a id=93388 href="#93388">ðŸ”—</a>Carl Lumma &#x3C;carl@...&#x3E;</h3><span>9/29/2010 1:04:05 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Igs wrote:</p><p>&gt; <a href="http://www.nature.com/news/2010/080110/full/news.2010.3.html">http://www.nature.com/news/2010/080110/full/news.2010.3.html</a></p><p>In case you don&apos;t have a subscription, the paper is<br/>available here</p><p><a href="http://www.purveslab.net/publications/bowling_purves_2009.pdf">http://www.purveslab.net/publications/bowling_purves_2009.pdf</a></p><p>at the website I sent you offlist.
