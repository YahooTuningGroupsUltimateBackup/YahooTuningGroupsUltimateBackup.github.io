I&apos;m new to MIDI composing and also to<br/>alternate tunings.  What I&apos;d like to do is redefine some pitches, like<br/>making C exactly 264 Hz, E exactly 330 Hz, etc.  How can I do this?  Is<br/>there a good place on the Web that explains this type of thing?  The<br/>abc2midi program is all I have to work with.</p><p>Also, is there a Web resource that comprehensively explains the terms<br/>otonal and utonal?</p><p>--<br/>Rob LeGrand<br/><a href="mailto:honky98@aggies.org">honky98@aggies.org</a><br/><a href="http://www.aggies.org/honky98/midi.html">http://www.aggies.org/honky98/midi.html</a></p></div><h3>Paul H.

It&apos;s pretty simple, though. Here are some<br/>frequency ratios for otonal chords and their utonal counterparts:</p><p>otonal         utonal<br/>4:5:6         1/6:1/5:1/4=10:12:15<br/>6:7:9         1/9:1/7:1/6=14:18:21<br/>16:19:24      1/24:1/19:1/16=38:48:57</p><p>Otonal chords are best though of as overtones over a (possibly absent but<br/>often still audible) fundamental, while utonal chords are best thought of as<br/>a set of fundamentals with a single common overtone (called the guide tone).<br/>For example, 4:5:6 is the 4th, 5th, and 6th harmonics of 1, while<br/>1/6:1/5:1/4 has a guide tone of 1 which is the 6th harmonic of the first<br/>note, the 5th harmonic of the second note, and the 4th harmonic of the third<br/>note. Clearly, your tones need to have integer harmonics for utonal chords<br/>to &quot;work&quot;, while otonal chords will &quot;work&quot; even if you have no harmonics at<br/>all or even a mild set of inharmonic partials.</p></div>
