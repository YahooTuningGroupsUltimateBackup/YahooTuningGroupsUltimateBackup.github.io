McClain published The Myth of Invariance in<br/>the late 1970&apos;s.  He told me last september that it is<br/>still in print.  He was Prof. of Music at Brooklyn<br/>College for many years and had the good fortune of<br/>meeting and becoming friends with two of the 20th<br/>Century&apos;s finest Pythagoreans, Ernst Levy and Sigmond<br/>Lavarie, both exiles from Nazi Germany.  Prof. McClain<br/>also published The Pythagorean Plato, as well as a<br/>book on Islamic Arithmology and tuning theory whose<br/>name escapes me but was something like Musings Through<br/>the Koran (I have a copy of it at home, but I&apos;m<br/>writing from the local community center).</p><p>After Ernest McClain, the deepest thinker I&apos;ve known<br/>in the field of tuning lore and theory is the Dutch<br/>Canadian, Siemen Terpstra.  Siem once told me that he<br/>had to read The Myth of Invariance from cover to cover<br/>three times in order to grasp it all.  I am still<br/>referring back to this book twenty-five years after I<br/>first read it.</p><p>As a serious, long time student of ancient Hindu Art<br/>of Yantra, I was glad to see that you felt that this<br/>work, &quot;...does have at least one idea which might be<br/>interesting, the musical yantra&quot;.  Everyone, of<br/>course, has the right to his or her own opinion, but I<br/>find the first sentence of your message, &quot;I checked<br/>this out, and it turns out to be a bizarre work of<br/>pseudo-scholarship&quot;, to be ignorant and offensive.<br/>The book is dense and full of unfamiliar concepts, but<br/>pseudo-scholarship it is not.  I can only hope that,<br/>as a microtonal brother, you take the time to read it<br/>a couple more times until you &quot;get it&quot;.  If you can<br/>persist, as Seim and I and John Chalmers and Erv<br/>Wilson did, I&apos;m sure that you will not be<br/>disappointed.</p><p>                          --Mark Rankin</p><p>--- Gene Ward Smith &lt;<a href="mailto:gwsmith@svpal.org">gwsmith@svpal.org</a>&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt; I checked this out, and it turns out to be a bizarre<br/>&gt; work of<br/>&gt; pseudo-scholarship.

Moreover an argument by<br/>authority will not impress me, so you&apos;d better try an argument<br/>argument by fact and reason if you care to make a convert of me.</p><p>&gt; The book is dense and full of unfamiliar concepts, but<br/>&gt; pseudo-scholarship it is not.</p><p>It is not dense, nor is it difficult; it is simply mostly utter nonsense.</p><p> I can only hope that,<br/>&gt; as a microtonal brother, you take the time to read it<br/>&gt; a couple more times until you &quot;get it&quot;.</p><p>Your belief that I don&apos;t believe the world is flat merely because I am<br/>too stupid to quickly grasp the deep and subtle arguments showing it<br/>can&apos;t be round is noted, but could your assessment be wrong? Again,<br/>open your mind, think, and you could learn something valuable from this.</p></div>
