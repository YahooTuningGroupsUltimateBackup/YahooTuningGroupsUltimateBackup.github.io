Additionally<br/>he notes that Ptolemy would include 8:3 (the eleventh, or fourth plus<br/>octave), although the Pythagoreans hold that it does not fit the<br/>pattern of a multiplex or superparticular ratio, and therefore should<br/>be excluded from this category.</p><p>The _Musica enchiriadis_ and _Scolica enchiriadis_ from around the<br/>late 9th century show how these _symphoniae_ may be used, singly or in<br/>combination, to make _organum_ or harmonious polyphony.</p><p>In my view, the practice nicely fits the theory of Boethius -- which<br/>might in turn reflect some kind of undocumented popular style of<br/>polyphony, who knows? The use of fifths and fourths as vertical<br/>intervals in various parts of the world is so widespread that I<br/>wouldn&apos;t be surprised if theory reflected practice. Certainly it&apos;s<br/>fair to say that the many communities around the world favoring these<br/>forms of polyphony don&apos;t need manuals to tell them which intervals to<br/>sing or play.</p><p>For example, I&apos;ve seen an example of Chinese polyphony favoring<br/>fourths which looks very much like the examples in the 9th-century<br/>treatises we&apos;re discussing -- cited, not so surprisingly, in Richard<br/>Hoppin&apos;s _Medieval Music_.</p><p>Of course there&apos;s a creative interaction between practice and theory.<br/>While 9th-century examples include passages in oblique or contrary<br/>motion, often involving unstable intervals, it&apos;s Guido d&apos;Arezzo<br/>writing around 1030 who describes and approves the deliberate use of<br/>these intervals at cadential points, especially the _tonus_ (9:8<br/>whole-tone) and _ditonus_ (81:64 ditone or major third).</p><p>By the 13th-14th centuries, we have what I consider one of the most<br/>sophisticated schemes of concord and discord in the history of<br/>European music, often with four, five, or six gradations from the<br/>purest concord to the most acute discord.</p><p>This theory is immensely important to my own music, in concept and<br/>practice, and the approach of multiple categories on a spectrum of<br/>concord/discord has been developed by modern theorists such as<br/>Ludmilla Ulehla in her _Contemporary Harmony_.</p><p>Of course, acoustical science has developed a great deal since the<br/>Gothic era, and the practice and theory of temperament has much added<br/>to our creative possibilities.</p><p>However, if one aims for an appreciation of medieval or neo-medieval<br/>style, I would say that the treatises of that era are an excellent<br/>guide to many aspects of the music.</p><p>Also, I would agree that a 9th-century or 13th-century theorist would<br/>be unlikely to write: &quot;What we&apos;re composing and performing is<br/>&apos;3-limit&apos; music.&quot; Neither would Rameau or Kirnberger be likely to<br/>write, &quot;What we&apos;re composing and performing is &apos;pre-atonal&apos; music.&quot;</p><p>Medieval theory is one viewpoint, and Partch&apos;s n-limit paradigm is<br/>another. Each outlook has its own language, a language reflecting a<br/>given stylistic practice or agenda. This isn&apos;t a matter of &quot;progress&quot;<br/>or the opposite; it&apos;s a matter of changing musical fashions, in<br/>practice and theory alike.</p><p>Often theory in a given time and locality can reflect practice, and<br/>medieval Europe may be no exception. During the 9th-11th century era,<br/>we can deduce that some areas leaned more toward fifths, others toward<br/>fourths (e.g. Guido).</p><p>Given the report by Coussemaker&apos;s Anonymous IV (c. 1275?) that people<br/>in the &quot;Westcountry&quot; of England consider thirds &quot;the best consonances,&quot;<br/>we shouldn&apos;t be surprised that Theinred of Dover (12th or 13th century)<br/>and Walter Odington (c. 1300) discuss simple ratios for these intervals<br/>at 5:4 and 6:5.</p><p>With Marchettus of Padua, in my view, we have an equally interesting<br/>description of what is likely an opposite kind of modification of<br/>Pythagorean tuning, with cadential major thirds expanding to fifths<br/>and major sixths expanding to octaves widened maybe to around 9:7 or<br/>12:7, or maybe closer to 13:10 and 26:15. For a recent paper on this<br/>kind of interpretation, please see</p><p><a href="http://value.net/~mschulter/marchetmf.txt">http://value.net/~mschulter/marchetmf.txt</a> (plain ASCII text)<br/><a href="http://value.net/~mschulter/marchetmf.zip">http://value.net/~mschulter/marchetmf.zip</a> (ASCII and PostScript)</p><p>If one chooses to follow this kind of reading, the question arises:<br/>was Marchettus championing a radically new practice, or at least in<br/>part reporting a tradition of intonation, maybe with popular elements?</p><p>Also, this discussion provides an opportunity to cite another view,<br/>that of our &quot;Monz,&quot; Joe Monzo:</p><p><a href="http://www.ixpres.com/interval/monzo/marchet/marchet.htm">http://www.ixpres.com/interval/monzo/marchet/marchet.htm</a></p><p>More generally, I would say that the most important reality concerning<br/>human music is the vast range of intervals, indeed a continuum, from<br/>which beautiful music can be made.</p><p>Let&apos;s suppose, for example, that certain simple ratios are found to be<br/>widespread in many world musics, rather as certain vowel or consonant<br/>sounds may be more common than others in natural languages.</p><p>Should this constrain people speaking languages with less common<br/>consonants -- or composers leaning toward less common consonances --<br/>to conform to the most frequent practice?</p><p>Or does this in some ways make the &quot;unusual&quot; all the more precious and<br/>significant, as an exercise in artistic choice and judgment?</p><p>Julia Werntz and Daniel Wolf, when I read your dialogue -- one which<br/>graces this forum with the views of two outstanding composers,<br/>theorists, and music educators -- I&apos;m tempted to say that a conclusion<br/>that &quot;simple ratios have a special &apos;recognizablility&apos; cutting across<br/>cultural lines&quot; would not radically change the artistic issues.</p><p>Now, as in the 16th century when Vicentino&apos;s use of &quot;unusual&quot;<br/>intervals was debated, we might have at least two viewpoints:</p><p>       (1) &quot;CLASSICISM&quot;: Art should imitate nature, and therefore<br/>           either small-integer JI or some tempered approximation<br/>           is the artistically most productive approach;</p><p>       (2) &quot;MANNERISM&quot;: Art should not merely imitate nature but<br/>            creatively distort it, defining its own reality of<br/>            coherence and pattern, and deliberately seeking out<br/>            something other than the &quot;obvious&quot; ratios.</p><p>By encouraging singers to learn to sing his fifthtones or enharmonic<br/>dieses (around 128:125 or 1/31 octave), Vicentino was aware that he<br/>was advocating a skill both novel and not so easy; he recommended his<br/>_archicembalo_ or &quot;superharpsichord&quot; as a guide, and opponents<br/>regarded such steps as &quot;unnatural&quot; for the human voice and ear.</p><p>Is it really that important whether 16th-century Italian singers found<br/>it easier to sing fifths than fifthtones as a result of nature or<br/>stylistic nurture? Vicentino considered the new artistic possibilities<br/>worth the effort, and maybe that&apos;s the main question.</p><p>With music, as with natural languages, I would consider variability<br/>and choice to be the most important factors, and the differences of<br/>view on concord/discord among members of this List could serve as an<br/>example.</p><p>If someone decides, &quot;I want to tune a third to an integer ratio of<br/>n:m, or to a ratio of x cents,&quot; there are two possibilities. Either it<br/>is an established interval size in some world music(s), or it is a new<br/>choice. Either way, it is a legitimate part of the continuum.</p><p>The question of how an interval _should_ be tuned, a sonority<br/>selected, or a composition organized, is one of style. To affirm the<br/>elements of pluralism and choice is not to exclude any music, but<br/>instead to affirm the continuum which leaves room for all the styles<br/>and cultural traditions celebrated on this List.</p><p>Most respectfully,</p><p>Margo Schulter<br/><a href="mailto:mschulter@value.net">mschulter@value.net</a></p></div><h3><a id=24786 href="#24786">ðŸ”—</a>Paul Erlich &#x3C;paul@stretch-music.com&#x3E;</h3><span>6/10/2001 2:29:02 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In tuning@y..., mschulter &lt;MSCHULTER@V...&gt; wrote:</p><p>&gt; Boethius says that consonance results from multiplex (n:1) or<br/>&gt; superparticular (n+1:n) ratios: 2:1, 3:1, 4:1, 3:2, 4:3.</p><p>Monz, this seems to contradict what you just said about Boethius. When I say organum<br/>was 3-limit, I mean that the _vertical sonorities_ were ratios using odd numbers no<br/>higher than 3. So it seems Boethius&apos;s theory accords well with this view, if something like<br/>organum existed in his day. If not, I would still claim that the extant music was<br/>influencing Boethius&apos;s theories, and not the other way around (though I would be happy<br/>to be proved wrong on that). But in either case, it seems clear that Boethius was _not_<br/>proposing anything like a 5-limit standard of consonance -- right?</p></div>
