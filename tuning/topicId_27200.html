I have been playing with converting certain number<br/>sequences into musical tones as an alternative to graphing them and for my<br/>current project I am hoping to find a scale in which pairs of notes that ar 5<br/>or 10 steps apart are each highly consonant.  I see that if a two-octave<br/>frame is divided into 17 equal steps, 5 steps is close to a 3/2 ratio and 10<br/>steps is close to a 9/4 ratio which looks promising.  What I want to know is,<br/>does this scale have a name? Is it musically useful?  and if so, have any<br/>compositions been written in it.  I&apos;ve recently begun listening to<br/>compositions (by Charles Carpenter) in the BP scale and I really like them.<br/>Thanks to anyone who responds,<br/>Eric deLaubenfels</p></div><h3><a id=27231 href="#27231">ðŸ”—</a>John A. deLaubenfels &#x3C;jdl@adaptune.com&#x3E;</h3><span>8/22/2001 8:44:12 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>[Eric wrote:]<br/>&gt;I am new to the world of alternative scales, so please forgive what may<br/>&gt;seem uninformed questions.</p><p>Welcome to the tuning list, Eric!

If so, how would rhythmic questions be<br/>decided?</p><p>Well, that&apos;s another can of worms.  The number sequences are<br/>quasiperiodic with a period of 5. That is if the nth number is x, the<br/>(n + 5)th number can be x, x + 5, x - 5, x + 10, etc. So you could<br/>have a simple sequence of equally (time)spaced tones or you could<br/>apply creativity to make a more interesting rhythm.</p><p>&gt; &gt;and for my current project I am hoping to find a scale in which<br/>pairs<br/>&gt; &gt;of notes that are 5 or 10 steps apart are each highly consonant.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Either, or both?</p><p>Both.</p><p>Typically, except for octaves, double a consonant<br/>&gt; interval is far less consonant than the original.</p><p>Yes, so 5tET would certainly work (but I want more notes!), while the<br/>~16/9 interval in 12tET doesn&apos;t seem good enough.  I am hoping that a<br/>doubling of 3/2 to 9/4 will still be OK.</p><p>&gt; &gt;I see that if a two-octave frame is divided into 17 equal steps, 5<br/>&gt; &gt;steps is close to a 3/2 ratio and 10 steps is close to a 9/4 ratio<br/>&gt; &gt;which looks promising.

Now my understanding of my family history<br/>is as follows...<br/>My great-great-granfather John Anthony deLaubenfels came to the US in<br/>the 1840s (so I know you are not him).  He had 8 children of whom 3<br/>died as infants and one was massacred along with 8 others by Apaches<br/>at age 19.  My great-grandfather Harry had two children, one of whom<br/>was my grandfather, Max, a somewhat famous marine biologist<br/>specializing in sponges.  My grandfather had 4 sons, one of which<br/>(Harry, I think, or Larry) disappeared in New Guinea in 1943.  And<br/>finally, my father is David deLaubenfels, a retired professor of<br/>Geography. Although my great-great-grandfather left siblings and<br/>cousins behind in Europe, I have never heard of any deLaubenfels now<br/>living in Europe.  So, John, do you recognize any of these names?</p><p>Getting back to a topic more relevant to the group, can you or anyone<br/>else recommend an application or instrument that someone with little<br/>or no musical training could use to translate number sequences into<br/>musical tone sequences?</p><p>Thanks for any replies,<br/>Eric delaubenfels</p></div>
