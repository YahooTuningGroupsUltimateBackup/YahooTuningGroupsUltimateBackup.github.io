Now, that you mention it, by<br/>&gt; playing accurate JI, I already play finer than a single cent.  Rudolf Rasch<br/>&gt; of Utrecht in the Netherlands wrote of heart jitter. This could be as much as<br/>&gt; some cents of interruption based on heartbeat action.  A wind instrument is<br/>&gt; not as directly connected to the musical tone as singing a tone (except maybe<br/>&gt; recorder).  The breathing is developed in a manner that keeps the pressure on<br/>&gt; the diaphragm constant.  So, the bassoon is even more accurate, at least as<br/>&gt; concerns jitter.</p><p>Interesting you should mention heart beat jitter. I&apos;ve had that in the past<br/>when playing the recorder, but it doesn&apos;t seem to happen any more. Maybe<br/>I&apos;ve learnt to breath in the appropriate fashion for a wind instrument!</p><p>&gt; Since JI ratios are actually heard at points between whole number cents, I<br/>&gt; can perform even more accurately than I have previously stated.  I am well<br/>&gt; aware of producing a JI interval, independent of counting cents.</p><p>Great!</p><p>I&apos;ll make sure I keep trying to learn and target j.i. intervals as well as<br/>cents in my practicing!</p><p>Robert</p></div>
