I think if world-music, ambiant or ethno-pop or whatever-musicians begin to hear what microtonality really brings to the exotic and vibrant atmospheres they&apos;re looking for, they would love it. And the more they train their ears with microtonality, the better it is. Not to mention our planet&apos;s tunings heritage (among other living things), that must urgently be saved.<br/>I am not worried about the fact that Ethno will sell (and I have no financial interest at all in the issue !), but I do think it would be worthy to have some correct microtonal demo songs for Ethno v.2.<br/>This is what I suggested to the Director of the Motu developpers here in France, and he seemed to be interested in the idea.<br/>I am not at all familiar with electronic keyboards and all the MIDI technology myself, and I would encourage any electronic musician from our list, and I know there are many super-skilled ones, to submit even short demos of the sort.<br/>The only contraints are that those would need to be all done with the Ethno bobox, but that&apos;s fair, and that I am not certain that the work would be paid... but who knows ?<br/>If I can help, I will.<br/>- - - - - - -<br/>Jacques</p><p>&gt;&gt; Jacques&gt;&quot;Version 2 of ETHNO, the World traditional instruments &gt;&gt; software sampler from MOTU (Mark of the Unicorn), is now microtonal.<br/>&gt;&gt; Even better, it should allows tuning by simple drag&apos;n&apos;drop of all &gt;&gt; your SCALA files ! - and keep them in memory too.<br/>&gt;&gt; How do I know ?
