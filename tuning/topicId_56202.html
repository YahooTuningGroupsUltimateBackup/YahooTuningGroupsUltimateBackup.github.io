It has been most fulfilling to benefit from your insightful thoughts. I look forward to the next episode of our dialogue.</p><p>As for my careless description of the Huzzam Maqam, what I meant to say is that the distance between Eb and F# which would normally correspond to an interval with the ratio 19683/16384 or a size of 317.5950 cents contracts in favor of raising the diatonical Eb to a very sharp hypothetical D# as if it were a conduit of E at a distance of 19:18, and lower the diatonical F# to Gb as if it were a conduit of F 20:19 far in the same manner. Nevertheless, we express such maqams using diatonical accidentals, even though they would not be considered so diatonical in Western theory.</p><p>On the other hand, I do not believe that historical 12 tone octave temperaments need any notation other than the Staff Notation in use today. One only needs to add a disclaimer to specify what temperament the musician has to perform.</p><p>Regarding my Spectral Notation proposal, I have developed it a little further and wish to hear your comments.</p><p>Cordially,<br/>Ozan Yarman</p><p>  ----- Original Message -----<br/>  From: wally paulrus<br/>  To: Ozan Yarman<br/>  Sent: 09 Kas&imath;m 2004 Sal&imath; 21:35<br/>  Subject: Re: Mr. Keenan&apos;s standard for interval naming</p><p>  Hi Ozan!</p><p>  &gt;I apologize for my absent-mindedness, my neglect was not deliberate.</p><p>  No problem!</p><p>  &gt;I<br/>  &gt;prepared a collective reply to your last 3 posts as a means to cement<br/>  &gt;our<br/>  &gt;amicable correspondence:</p><p>  Excellent! And feel free to forward any or all of my remarks to the list and/or George, as you see fit. Certainly if George was the one making any unfounded assertions about how I would notate microtonal music, you should set him straight with the reactions I sent you.</p><p>  &gt;You have outlined perfectly the issue with Mr. Keenan&apos;s approach that I<br/>  &gt;botched in my turgid explanation. Indeed, I am in &grave;perfect&grave; alignment<br/>  &gt;with<br/>  &gt;you that 3/2 &grave;plus&grave; 9/8 should make 27/16, thus a pythagorean major<br/>  &gt;sixth,<br/>  &gt;as opposed to 5/3 which is a just major sixth and thence a didymus&apos;<br/>  &gt;comma (81/80) lower, which support your thesis that each sound system<br/>  &gt;should be attributed a unique intervallic lexicon, with which I am<br/>  &gt;again in<br/>  &gt;&grave;perfect&grave; alignment.</p><p>  I just meant that, whatever exact ratios or irrational specifications are supposedly mapped to the interval names, that a &apos;perfect fifth&apos; plus a &apos;major second&apos; should equal a &apos;major sixth&apos;, and if it doesn&apos;t, musicians are going to get way too confused by the system.</p><p>  &gt;What I meant by &quot;a sub fifth being the deviation-wise correspondent of<br/>  &gt;a<br/>  &gt;minor third&quot;, is that Mr. Keenan has assigned the same -1 index prefix<br/>  &gt;to<br/>  &gt;both a &grave;sub fifth&grave; and a &grave;minor third&grave;.</p><p>  Yes but this is not in reference to a comparable &apos;zero&apos; point in the two cases, so I&apos;m afraid you&apos;re reading too much into the &apos;sameness&apos; of the two &apos;-1&apos;s.</p><p>  &gt;Barring the mathematical<br/>  &gt;corrections<br/>  &gt;to his indices, that would make a narrow fifth the semantic equivalent<br/>  &gt;of a<br/>  &gt;minor third instead of a perfect fifth.</p><p>  I&apos;m afraid this looks like an incorrect characterization of Dave Keenan&apos;s system. Your conclusion would only follow if a &apos;perfect fifth&apos; was somehow the semantic equivalent of a &apos;neutral third&apos;, but nothing in Dave Keenan&apos;s system supports such a view. In fact, almost everything Dave&apos;s done supports an opposite view, that a neutral third would tend to be regarded, semantically and notationally, as a deviation from some other inteval, while the perfect fifth would be the most basic interval after the octave. So it appears to me that you are taking this one table of Dave&apos;s out of context, and imbuing it with meaning it does not have.</p><p>  &gt;Another note on the disparities between the tonal systems of East and<br/>  &gt;West<br/>  &gt;is my finding that the diatonic progression of a maqam requires the<br/>  &gt;sharps<br/>  &gt;and flats to be interchanged with each other, so much so that the<br/>  &gt;central<br/>  &gt;notes of the Hijaz tetrachord (D, Eb, F#, G) in the Huzzam maqam<br/>  &gt;contract in<br/>  &gt;favor of raising the Eb to the level of a very shrill D# as a conduit<br/>  &gt;to E.</p><p>  This confuses me -- are you saying D# is higher than Eb? If so, what &apos;contracts?&apos; And where does E come in; why would one need a &apos;conduit&apos; to it if it does not occur in the maqam?</p><p>  &gt;Nevertheless, I have to admit that I&apos;m very partial<br/>  &gt;to<br/>  &gt;reserving the natural unaltered note-heads on the staff to ditonic<br/>  &gt;pythagorean values unless a chosen temperament demands otherwise (such<br/>  &gt;as<br/>  &gt;5-edo or 7-edo).</p><p>  These are rather unlikely temperament for Western notation! What about something like, say, meantone temperament, which happened to dominant and shape Western music in its formative years (c. 1480-1780)? And what about an adaptive tuning that maintains the advantages of meantone while adjusting each chord to be just within itself?</p><p>  &gt;Using colors in order to distinguish irregular<br/>  &gt;temperaments<br/>  &gt;seems to be the only</p><p>  Irregular temperaments include Werckmeister (III), Kirnberger (II, III), etc. The differences between one irregular temperament and another can be very tiny in some cases. Using colors to distinguish one irregular temperament from another sounds like a =n extremely tall order, one not likely to be able to usefully communicate much information. Surely I&apos;ve misunderstood you somehow?</p><p>  &gt;circumbendibus</p><p>  I don&apos;t know this word.</p><p>  &gt;that makes sense at this point. I,<br/>  &gt;for<br/>  &gt;one, cannot think of any other way to adjudicate between the<br/>  &gt;secterianist<br/>  &gt;musicians of the East with the conservative ones in the West.</p><p>  Wow, that sounds profound, but I have no idea what it means.</p><p>  &gt;I know that my language requires some polish,</p><p>  Not at all. Your english is superior to that of many native speaking scholars. Bravo!</p><p>  I hope we can continue in this manner for some time to come.</p><p>  Best,<br/>  Paul</p><p>------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p>  Hello Ozan,</p><p>  --- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;Ozan Yarman&quot; &lt;ozanyarman@s...&gt; wrote:</p><p>  &gt; I do not favor the clumping of the apotome and the limma together<br/>  &gt;actually, but it is possible to temper the limma out and adopt a 36-<br/>  &gt;edo system.</p><p>  Technically speaking, if you temper the limma out, you get a 5-tET<br/>  system, not 36-tET, let alone any edo . . . and that&apos;s assuming you<br/>  started with Pythagorean (3-limit JI) -- otherwise an equal tuning<br/>  doesn&apos;t result from tempering the limma out at all . . .
