I was just wondering if anyone could shed some light on some strange scales I stumbled on awhile ago, but have yet to find information on.</p><p>9 equal divisions of the perfect fourth is listed on the xenharmonic wiki as the Noleta Scale. There is no page for this tuning, and I can not find information about it elsewhere online.</p><p>The next strange scale (or tuning, to be more correct) is used in the folk music of Georgia. (the country) It has more documented information, and is described on Wikipedia:</p><p>&quot;Scales used in traditional Georgian music have, like most European scales, octaves divided into seven tones (eight including the octave), but the spacing of the tones is different. As with most traditional systems of tuning, traditional Georgian folk music uses a just perfect fifth. Between the unison and the fifth, however, come three evenly-spaced notes, producing a compressed (compared to most European music) major second, a neutral third, and a stretched perfect fourth. Likewise, between the fifth and the octave come two evenly-spaced notes, producing a compressed major sixth and a stretched minor seventh. This system of tuning renders thirds as the most consonant interval after fifths, which resulted in the third being treated as a stable interval in Georgia long before it acquired that status in Western music.[4]</p><p>Some consider the Georgian scale a &quot;quintave system&quot; (as opposed to the octave-repeating &quot;octave system&quot;). Due to the neutral tuning within the quintave system, the eighth degree or octave is slightly widened, which often results in a rise in pitch from the beginning of a song to the end.&quot;</p><p>I have not heard much discussion of this scale in the microtonal community, but I believe it deserves much more, so I would love to start a discussion, especially because it repeats at the perfect fifth. (or does it?) I would like to find some scholarly articles on this tuning as to make a decision on if this scale is actually intonated as 4-EDF in practice, and if it is, if there are octaves added in to the system.</p><p>(Exceprt from a site cited by wikipedia;) &quot;In general, in music with true three-part polyphonic independence and a small melodic range, fifths will be more important than octaves. The fifth will replace the octave as the unit of structural stability and pitch equivalence, and the scale will repeat at the fifth instead of the octave.&quot;</p></div><h3>Carl Lumma &#x3C;carl@...&#x3E;</h3><span>6/24/2011 12:15:59 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>&quot;Gotta Love Septimal Minor Thirds&quot; wrote:</p><p>&gt; The next strange scale (or tuning, to be more correct) is used<br/>&gt; in the folk music of Georgia.
