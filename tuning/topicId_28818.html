In that case I don&apos;t see a way to unsubscribe<br/>since you haven&apos;t set up a Yahoo account. Unsubscribing via<br/>email doesn&apos;t work if the email address is not exactly the same<br/>as it was when you subscribed. Then the only way is to contact<br/>Mark Nowitzky, this list&apos;s moderator, to do it for you.</p><p>Manuel</p></div>
