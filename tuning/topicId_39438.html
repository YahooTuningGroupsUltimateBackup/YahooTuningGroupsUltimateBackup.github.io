The operating system itself is the most obvious.<br/> And the courts have ruled that Windows gives Microsoft an uncompetitive<br/>advantage.  But they&apos;ve also ruled that Microsoft used illegal tactics to<br/>maintain their monopoly.  So it goes beyond simple network effects.</p><p>Possibly BeOS had a clear advantage at one point, as another poster<br/>suggested.  It&apos;s the best advantage I can think of, but hey, what do I<br/>know?</p><p>I can see many reasons why network affects are more important for computer<br/>operating systems than musical instruments.  Operating systems really are<br/>useless without compatible software.  Instruments are useless without<br/>music, but it&apos;s much easier to adapt existing music than software.  I<br/>heard Stravinsky played on two accordions not long ago.  A generalised<br/>keyboard shouldn&apos;t be a problem.  To port software to a new operating<br/>system you first need to port the programming language.  I don&apos;t see any<br/>parallel with musical instruments.</p><p>There are network effects holding back new tunings.  You really do need<br/>new music before new instruments become useful.  But plenty of us are<br/>getting microtonal music to work with existing instruments -- which may be<br/>what you&apos;re arguing for.  There have been big advances in the past 50<br/>years.  If alternative tunings do offer a plainly superior way of making<br/>music (and I wouldn&apos;t be here if I didn&apos;t think that) they should catch<br/>on.  Then the keyboards will have to adapt.</p><p>&gt; we all use standard<br/>&gt; railway gauge,</p><p>Not everybody does.  Russia and India for example, a few others from a<br/>Google search.  But no evidence that any other gauge is plainly superior.<br/>Brunel thought trains could run faster along 7 foot (2134 mm) gauge.<br/>Interestingly, even where broad gauge is in use today I can&apos;t find any<br/>examples where it&apos;s *that* broad!  Also nothing to say that rail journeys<br/>were faster south of Gloucester before the GWR made the switch.</p><p>This beastie:</p><p><a href="http://www.o-keating.com/hsr/ave.htm">http://www.o-keating.com/hsr/ave.htm</a></p><p>runs on both standard and broad (1674 mm) gauge, and is considerably<br/>faster on standard gauge.</p><p><a href="http://microsoftgamesinsider.com/TrainSimulator/NewsAndFeatures/What_Makes">http://microsoftgamesinsider.com/TrainSimulator/NewsAndFeatures/What_Makes</a><br/>_Standard_Gauge_Standard.htm</p><p>says why broad gauge was plainly inferior in the early days:</p><p>&quot;&quot;&quot;<br/>Most Maine and Colorado railroads opted for narrower 24&quot; and 36&quot; gauge for<br/>economic reasons. Put simply, narrow-gauge tracks use less wood for ties,<br/>which were one of the more expensive components at the time the lines were<br/>built. Also, narrow-gauge equipment negotiates tighter curves like those<br/>needed in the mountains of Colorado. In New Mexico and Colorado there are<br/>still operating examples of the once-extensive Denver &amp; Rio Grande Western<br/>narrow gauge system.<br/>&quot;&quot;&quot;</p><p>(24&quot; is 610 mm, 36&quot; is 914 mm.  Standard gauge is 1435 mm.)</p><p>&gt; and English is an awful language, yet it is slowly<br/>&gt; killing<br/>&gt; off languages around the world.</p><p>English has many features that make it easy to learn as a second language.<br/> Most obvious that few words carry genders around with them.</p><p>&gt; Todays pet econobabble doesn&apos;t erase the<br/>&gt; past.</p><p>Then can you provide a counter example?</p><p>&gt; If nobody can play the great music then the great music will remain in<br/>&gt; the<br/>&gt; fringe. Even great music written in conventional ways with conventional<br/>&gt; instruments remains in the fringe.</p><p>We have machines now that can play anything you can describe.  Nancarrow<br/>wrote music for machines that most people thought was unplayable, until<br/>other people started playing it.</p><p>Music you like may be on the fringe, but that&apos;s probably because you have<br/>fringe tastes.   Pretty much everything that even a fringe considers to be<br/>great is getting performances and recordings these days.  So if the<br/>mainstream audience like it, it has every chance of joining the<br/>mainstream.  That assumes popular appeal is part of greatness, but I<br/>didn&apos;t define it before.  So there.</p><p>&gt; My view is to write great music with instruments which can be adapted<br/>&gt; for<br/>&gt; the purpose, without disturbing too greatly the technique of the<br/>&gt; performer.<br/>&gt; Then, if these performers can then see how much easier it could be<br/>&gt; played<br/>&gt; on the &apos;new instruments&apos;, the new instruments will take off.</p><p>It&apos;s the &quot;write great music&quot; bit I&apos;m having difficulty with now.  If I can<br/>write it, I can play it, or at least program it in.  But I agree it&apos;s best<br/>to decouple the music from the instruments.</p><p>&gt; You just can&apos;t shove a generalised keyboard in front of my (ordinary -<br/>&gt; NB!)<br/>&gt; musician, and expect them to adjust. You&apos;ve got to make them *want* to<br/>&gt; play<br/>&gt; the new keyboards, new instruments.</p><p>That&apos;s a clear example of Liebowitz&apos;s weak lock-in.  Everybody knows it<br/>exists, but it doesn&apos;t hold back plainly superior alternatives.  Yes, they<br/>won&apos;t play the new instruments if they don&apos;t want to.  There are all kinds<br/>of marginal instruments that attract first rate performers.  Generalized<br/>keyboards could do the same.</p><p>&gt; There are some who are always willing to experiment, but these are in<br/>&gt; the<br/>&gt; minority. But at least the minority is growing.</p><p>Communications (cheap recording, electronic instruments, air freight, the<br/>internet(!)) have improved to the point that minorities don&apos;t have to<br/>worry about being minorities any more.</p><p>                       Graham</p></div>
