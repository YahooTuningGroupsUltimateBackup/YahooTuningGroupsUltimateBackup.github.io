A computer?  Helmholtz<br/>defined beats as combination tones which cause interference.  For simple<br/>tones he restricted use of the term &quot;beats&quot; to fundamentals differing by<br/>about 30 Hz or less.  Without knowing the timbre there is no way to calculate<br/>beats other than those produced between fundamentals, which amounts to a<br/>first order difference tone f1-f2.</p><p>The example of 443-352 simple tones gives nothing called &quot;beats&quot; by the<br/>Helmholtzian definition, because the difference is 91 which is greater than<br/>the cutoff of around 30 for &quot;simple tones.&quot;  It&apos;s more complicated than that<br/>because &quot;simple tones&quot; don&apos;t generally exist.</p><p>A good way to learn about beats with a computer is to pick some interesting<br/>timbres and just start listening intently for beats in sustained random<br/>intervals &lt; 2/1.  Some intervals will seem to have fewer beats with one<br/>timbre but will have more beats with another (though relationship between the<br/>two should be evident.)  With complex timbres, for the majority of intervals<br/>you will hear layers upon layers of beats which change according to the<br/>timbre you use.  If you try calculating beats according to combination tones<br/>occuring between prominent harmonics of some of the timbres for intervals<br/>which have a beating patterns that you like, you will begin to understand the<br/>great mysteries of the beats.</p><p>Aaron</p></div>
