It is as if something were crumbling, decaying and exhausting<br/>itself, while something else, still indistinct, were arising from the rubble. . .<br/>We are in a phase when one age is succeeding another, when everything is<br/>possible. (Havel: 1994)<br/>These words from a 1994 speech by Vaclav Havel point to the collapse of<br/>existing value systems, the plurality of cultures, and the turmoil of social<br/>changes as signs of the end of modernity and the birth of a new era in human<br/>history. This time is commonly known as the epoch of post modernism, a time for<br/>questioning presumptions, revising axiologies, exploding borders, and transforming<br/>every truth into a &quot;truth.&quot; The almost universal acceptance of the postmodern<br/>paradigm in humanistic studies, including musicology, reveals the deeply felt<br/>necessity for re-examining the fundamental issues of value, meaning and<br/>context.<br/>Postmodern world is one in which a grand unified theory of existence cannot<br/>be proposed; often, it is characterized by fragmentation, non-linearity and<br/>heterogeneity Lyotard: 1979, cf. also Docherty : 1993). Similarly, postmodern<br/>music is a world of musics, an incoherent universe of musical styles and cultures<br/>whose only link is their simultaneous existence on the same small planet. In<br/>the field of contemporary concert music, the postmodern is often associated<br/>with the use of quotation, ironic inverted comas, and a self-conscious<br/>juxtaposition of styles. However, postmodern musicology abandons this field of<br/>&quot;modernist&quot; music altogether, for the sake of cultural critique of traditional<br/>&quot;canonic&quot; art musics and contemporary pop, rock, and world musics. References to new<br/>literary theory, psychoanalysis, deconstruction and feminist theory abound.<br/>Kristeva, Lacan, Bakhtin and Adorno all have their devotees: contextualising<br/>music is the battle-cry for the New or Critical Musicology. Scholars rush to<br/>cross the boundaries of interdisciplinary and explore new methodologies. Among the<br/>disciplines invoked in such border-crossings, privileged positions are<br/>occupied by sociology, literary theory, and semiotics. Here, music is a part of the<br/>complex manifold of socially grounded sign systems and texts. These approaches<br/>have an enormous value in seeking to fill in the lacunae in the earlier<br/>paradigm of music as an autonomous art. The traditional belief that music dwells in<br/>a unique world of totally original, fully self standing, and<br/>complete-in-themselves musical artifacts continues to influence ways of dealing with this art.<br/>With its roots in the complex notion of absolute music, embracing the<br/>romantic idealization of music as the most immaterial of all arts, the thesis of<br/>musical autonomy has been both extremely appealing and problematic (Dahlhaus:<br/>1978/1989).<br/>What the postmodern, &quot;critical&quot; approaches often miss is the vital connection<br/>of music to its sound material; what they often ignore is the sonorous<br/>presence of music in the world that makes music a part of the human environment. The<br/>physicality of the musical sound, the spatiality of musical performances are<br/>bypassed on the way to signification. When postmodern scholars, such as Susan<br/>McClary, invoke music&apos;s bodily presence in performance, their attention shifts<br/>immediately to the body, its gender, its theatricality (see especially the<br/>study of Laurie Anderson in McClary 1991). The sonorous is left behind.<br/>The new ecological approach to music study that I propose under the rubric of<br/>music ecology or eco-musicology (appropriate even if awkward) attempts to<br/>contextualize music as sound and relate musical sound-material to other sonic<br/>realities, both natural -- of the non-human organic and in-organic worlds --and<br/>technologically created. This approach highlights the sensory aspects of<br/>music-making: tactile textures, spatial dimensions, and timbral riches that, due to<br/>their diversity and abundance, evade unifying tendencies of theory-making. It<br/>also brings in a renewed emphasis on the links between nature and culture,<br/>seen not as opposites, but as permeating one another in a mutual relationship. I<br/>will return to the definitions of the field and methods of eco-musicology<br/>after outlining a conceptual basis for this proposed undertaking.<br/>II<br/>Let me start with the issue of the cultural significance of the placement of<br/>human subjects within their natural/cultural environments. According to the<br/>new cultural movement of deep ecology, the total sphere of human life experience<br/>encompasses the awareness of, and solidarity with, the whole living universe.<br/>In the speech quoted at the beginning of this paper, Vaclav Havel described<br/>our times as the birth of an era of global awareness, of human unity with all<br/>Life. The writer pointed out the importance of the Gaia hypothesis<br/>(Lovelock:1979) which implies treating the whole Earth as one meta organism of symbiotic<br/>life-forms, an organism that may destroy what threatens it (i.e. it may<br/>dispense with humans). To counter this image of human insignificance, Havel invoked a<br/>second principle, the Anthropic Cosmological Principle locating human beings<br/>at the centre of all Universe, as the goal of cosmic evolution, stating that<br/>&quot;from the countless possible courses of its evolution, the universe took the<br/>only one that enabled life to emerge&quot; (Havel:113). Both principles together<br/>remind us, concluded Havel, that &quot;the only real hope of people today is . . . a<br/>renewal of our certainty that we are rooted in the earth and, at the same time,<br/>in the cosmos.&quot;<br/>Since the Carthesian revolution, human identity was linked to inwardness and<br/>self reflection, separated from the world outside and rooted in the<br/>transcendent world of pure spirituality, the world of the divine (Taylor: 1989). The<br/>late 20th century has seen various alternatives to this vision. In Pierre<br/>Teilhard de Chardin&apos;s philosophy of Christian evolutionism, the isolation of the<br/>Cartesian Self has been subsumed by a grand vision of the noosphere superposed on<br/>the biosphere of our planet and consisting of all thinking beings and the sum<br/>total of their relationships (Teilhard de Chardin 1959). Teilhard&apos;s noosphere<br/>is still involved in the process of noogenesis and convergence, evolving<br/>towards the final point at the end of time: the Omega point of evolution. While<br/>treating individual human minds as mere sparks in the cosmic incandescence of the<br/>Divine Mind, Teilhard de Chardin pointed the way towards intuiting the<br/>totality of life, the close connectedness of all human beings - a junction made<br/>possible by their copresence on the same planet. For the French Jesuit, however,<br/>humans are separated from non-humans by their capacity for thought and only the<br/>human evolution has a telos, a final end-point of union with Divinity.<br/>In contrast, ecophilosophers, such as the Norvegian Arne Naess, focus on the<br/>diversity, corporeality and transience of human life, treating humans as yet<br/>another life form, a species of animals, thinking apes, not the stewards of all<br/>creation (Naess:1973, 1989). Naess&apos;s ecophilosophy seeks to clarify the place<br/>of our species within nature. If ecolo means &quot;the interdisciplinary<br/>scientific study of the living conditions of organisms in interaction with each other<br/>and with the surroundings, organic as well as inorganic&quot; (Naess, 36),<br/>ecophilosophy is a field of study bringing ecology and philosophy together, while<br/>ecasophy  is a personal application of this field and ideas used &quot;to approach<br/>practical situations involving ourselves.&quot;<br/>The perspective of ecophilosophy or deep ecology  is opposed to the<br/>traditional &quot;man-in-the-environment&quot; image upheld by humanists and Christians alike.<br/>The new paradigm involves &quot;the relational, total-field image&quot; emphasizing the<br/>vitality of connections between people and the surrounding world. Naess sees all<br/>organisms, including, humans, as &quot;knots in the field of intrinsic relations&quot;<br/>(p. 28), relations which change the objects involved and are essential to<br/>them. The principles of deep ecology point out that the flourishing of human and<br/>non-human life on Earth has intrinsic value and that richness and diversity of<br/>life-forms are values in themselves. In political terms. ecophilosophy<br/>provides a conceptual basis for the deep ecology movement, the purpose for which is<br/>not a slight reform of the present society, but a &quot;substantial reorientation of<br/>our whole civilization&quot; (p. 45). The reorientation changes the direction away<br/>from seeking a high standard of living (associated with consumerism and<br/>waste) towards a global enrichment of the quality of human life found in<br/>Self-realization through the close contact with other humans and with the non-human<br/>ecosphere (the quality of life is non definable and non-quantifiable).<br/>In a direct opposition to Rene Descartes&apos;s cogito ergo sum, Naess posits that<br/>the identity of the individual, &quot;that I am something&quot; is developed through<br/>interaction with a broad manifold, organic and inorganic. The Norvegian<br/>philosopher maintains that &quot;to distance oneself from nature and the &apos;natural&apos; is to<br/>distance oneself from a part of that which the &apos;I&apos; is built up of&quot; (p. 164).<br/>Thus, the polar opposition of nature and culture is entirely false. The<br/>ecophilosophical stance strongly objects to its source, that is the<br/>postivistic-scientific world view. Naess questions one of the basic premises of science, that of<br/>the existence of things in themselves which possess primary, measurable<br/>qualities (e.g. size, shape, movement). The scientific world view empties Nature of<br/>sensory content, delegating the secondary qualities of colour, warmth, etc. to<br/>the perceiving subject. As Naess writes, for the scientist, &quot;real nature is<br/>something infinitely different from what humankind immediately experiences and<br/>appreciates&quot; (p. 51). Through this viewpoint, &quot;human reality is served from<br/>nature proper.&quot; All prestige belongs to the core of reality which is real,<br/>measurable and scientific&quot; (p. 53). Yet, simultaneously, nature is interpreted as<br/>&quot;both slave and raw material&quot; (p. 191).<br/>Instead of this reification leading to abuse, Naess proposes an affirmation<br/>of Nature that humans are a part of his ecophilosophy claims that &quot;organisms<br/>and milieux are not two things . . . organisms presuppose milieux&quot; (p. 56).<br/>Similarly, a person is a part of nature to the extent that he or she too is a<br/>relational junction within the total field. All beings, not just humans, have a<br/>right to self-realization (i.e. its potential) and all are valuable in<br/>themselves. In the philosopher&apos;s words, &quot;the conceptual bridge from Self-realization to<br/>a positive evaluation of diversity, complexity, and symbiosis, is furnished<br/>by a concept of Self-realization potentials, and the idea that the overall self<br/>- realisation in our world is increased by the realization of such<br/>potentials&quot; (p. 200).<br/>In order to overcome the traditional separation of the objective from the<br/>subjective, Naess draws from Protagorean &quot;both/and&quot; theory of perception,<br/>affirming the value of tertiary qualities, that is complex gestalt features of the<br/>world (p. 52). The world in itself has all the properties which are perceived by<br/>each individual in the relational field--&quot;the totality of our interrelated<br/>experience&quot; (p. 55). The secondary and tertiary qualities of which the<br/>relational field consists of are the only elements of existence. The primary,<br/>measurable qualities of matter are mathematical-physical, ideal, abstract relations<br/>(e.g. Length, curvature, wave, etc.); in Naess&apos;s words &quot;the geometry of the world<br/>is not in the world&quot; (p. 57). In the both-and theory there are no completely<br/>separable objects. Moreover, to further strengthen the junction of the inner<br/>with the outer, Naess posits the existence of apperceptive gestalts which &quot;bind<br/>the I and the not-l together in a whole&quot;  (p. 60). Gestalt formation &quot;crosses<br/>boundaries between what is conventionally classed as thinking as separated<br/>from emotion&quot; (p. 63). The elevated role of phenomenological insights and<br/>gestalt psychology in ecophilosophy has a bearing for its usefulness in the<br/>ecological study of music, as it will be shown later.<br/>Thus, to sum up the main points, deep ecology implies (1) a holistic approach<br/>to the environment from which human beings cannot be isolated and separated.<br/>The awareness of the profound unity of all Life calls for a change in<br/>lifestyle, with the focus on (2) the quality of experience and Self-realization, not<br/>on increasing wealth and consumption as measures of personal and social<br/>well-being. The oneness of Life requires (3) the diversity, complexity and symbiosis<br/>of various life-forms, including humans. S ymbiosis means &quot;interdependence for<br/>the benefit of all&quot; (p. 168); it &quot;knits a bond between complexity and<br/>diversity&quot; (p. 201). In ecophilosophy, &quot;life is viewed as a kind of vast whole. . .<br/>the variety of forms of life, with their different capacities, realise, that<br/>is, bring into actuality, something which adds to that whole&quot; (p. 200).<br/>III.<br/>How does ecophilosophy relate to music? What consequences for the study and<br/>practice of the sonic art can be derived from such a radical, all-encompassing<br/>world view? Naess&apos;s philosophical reflections contain many threads that may<br/>inspire musicological reflection. Since this borrowing should be acknowledged I<br/>propose to use two labels interchangeably--music ecology, and eco-musicology,<br/>the latter mirroring Naess&apos;s neologism. Both expressions contain three<br/>conceptual particles: eco from the Greek oiks, i.e. household, community, (as in<br/>ecology and economy ), music and logos, (i.e. word). In accordance with its<br/>tripartite title, the ecological approach to music research takes into account the<br/>musical life of our home planet, in its diversity, complexity and symbiosis. If<br/>defined so broadly, eco-musicology would encompass all music in theory and<br/>practice, and lose its focus in the process. A more precise definition describes<br/>this domain as the study of music in its environments--including cultural<br/>environments, since nature is not opposed to culture-- with a particular emphasis<br/>on the aural experiences acquired in natural-and-cultural sonic habitats,<br/>rural and urban soundscapes.<br/>In its most general sense, the triple ecological principle (diversity,<br/>complexity and symbiosis) may relate music to the totality of other human and<br/>non-human acoustic environments. While uncovering the relationship of music to<br/>various manifestations of Life, eco-musicology may draw from fields relevant to a<br/>particular topic, e.g. phenomenology and hermeneutics, studies of auditory<br/>perception (Bregman:1990), ornithology, anthropology, etc. A particular attention<br/>is given to music created explicitly with some &quot;environmental&quot; or &quot;ecological&quot;<br/>purpose or context, e.g. works by R. Murray Schafer, Pauline Oliveros,<br/>Hildegard Westerkamp, Francois-Bernard Mache and many others. However, discovering<br/>connections between individual compositions and distinct styles and their<br/>nature-cultural environments, might take place without any overt references to the<br/>existence of such relationships made by the composers and performers.<br/>Since much ecomusicological attention is spent on &quot;extramusical&quot; factors; a<br/>question arises: &quot;is it a mimetic theory of art in a new guise?&quot; Yes and no.<br/>Yes, for in ecomusicological approach, the value of music is situated not in its<br/>portrayal of the nature&apos;s effect on the emotions of a detached subject (e.g.<br/>the Romantic experience of nature since Beethoven&apos;s Pastoral Symphony) but in<br/>the following of nature&apos;s mode of action--as defined by St. Thomas Aquinas in<br/>his famous Ars imitatur naturam  (e.g. structural applications of the<br/>proportions of the golden section and of formal patterns borrowed from birdsong, or<br/>the use of chaos theory in computer music). Simultaneously, the answer to the<br/>charge of &quot;mimetic character&quot; of eco-musicology is &quot;No,&quot; because in this<br/>approach the opposition between nature and culture is highly dubious. The human<br/>environment is taken broadly and includes all human activity, all the musical past,<br/>all human and non-human soundscapes preceding the creation of a given<br/>performance, a given work of art.<br/>Music ecology focuses on the music&apos;s connection to our planet&apos;s life, by<br/>recognizing mimetic imitations of elements of natural soundscapes in music, and by<br/>tracing inspirations with environmental processes and phenomena. Thus, it<br/>studies ecological or environmental music, but is not limited to the focus on the<br/>music&apos;s content or context and may be applied to various musical styles and<br/>works. This approach eschews the fixation on the abstract (primacy of pitch)<br/>and the obsession with structural coherence of musical artifacts (individual<br/>works). The performative and perceptual aspects of music-making are taken into<br/>consideration in an account that seeks to transcend the limitations of music<br/>notation. The focus on the perceptual primacy of what Naess calls tertiary<br/>qualities implies a change of perspective, from an almost exclusive concern with the<br/>primary element of pitch abstractions, to the complex, interrelated aspects<br/>of music in its sonorous manifestation. These three basic areas of music<br/>ecology discussed so far are summarized in Table 1.</p><p>------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>TABLE 1: MAIN PRINCIPLES OF MUSIC ECOLOGY<br/>1.  Emphasis on holistic perception and the sonoristic approach to music<br/>study (music as sound; application of principles of Auditory Scene Analysis);<br/>2.  Applications of the triple ecological principle of diversity, complexity,<br/>symbiosis;<br/>3.  Focus on relationships between music and environment:<br/>*   in performance<br/>*   in compositional design<br/>*   n representation</p><p>------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>Ecomusicological approach highlights differences between musical styles<br/>relating to their modes of performance and primary acoustic environments. For<br/>instance, the difference between an enormous dynamic range of the symphony<br/>orchestra, spanning the entire spectrum from ppppp to fifif, and the flat dynamic<br/>envelope of uniformly loud rock music reflects the contrast between the total<br/>silence of the ideal concert hall which excludes all elements of external<br/>soundscapes, and the noisiness of modern dwellings in bustling cities permeated with a<br/>constant layer of traffic noise which masks all sonic subtlety. Recall the<br/>frustration of listening to a symphony in a car--the moving sound dome of urban<br/>culture--where the music constantly falls below the threshold of audibility.<br/>Or, to use another example of the coupling of music with its acoustic<br/>environment, imagine a performance of a Palestrina&apos;s Mass in an outdoor theatre, amidst<br/>cries of ice&#x1F;cream vendors and gusts of winds, without reverberation. You<br/>will really have to stretch your sonic imagination to appreciate this music under<br/>such inappropriate conditions. Marching brass bands, on the other hand, work<br/>outdoors very well.<br/>Music ecology, if practiced earnestly, might lead to a discovery of<br/>relationships between outdoor soundscapes, and musical genres and styles. In the words<br/>of R. Murray Schafer, &quot;music moves into concert halls when it can no longer be<br/>effectively heard out of doors. There, behind padded walls, concentrated<br/>listening becomes possible. That is to say, the string quartet and urban<br/>pandemonium are historically contemporaneous.&quot; (Schafer 1977). The emphasis on the<br/>total acoustic image of a musical work implies a consideration of performance<br/>settings, types of sound sources, and compositional designs, that is patterns of<br/>spatial placements of musicians and audiences (cf. Harley: 1994a).<br/>IV. In one particular sense, the principles of diversity, complexity and<br/>symbiosis may govern the relationships between various musical-cultures,<br/>and--within one culture--the coexistence of distinct genres and styles. Eco-musicology,<br/>then, may means the study focused on music in the world, not in a<br/>sociological sense, as the music&apos;s involvement in societal ideologies, activities,<br/>organizations, but in a general &quot;ecological&quot; sense, centered on the music&apos;s<br/>immersion in the acoustic world around us. Instead of pursuing what Harold Bloom<br/>(Bloom 1994) calls &quot;the triple question of the agon--more than, less than, equal<br/>to?&quot; in reference to the individual musical works, ecomusicological approach may<br/>center on the symbiosis and competition between different transnational<br/>styles and cultures (i.e. classical music, jazz, rock, pop) proliferating through<br/>development of technological environments (recording, broadcast, computer<br/>networks). How would this approach differ from ethno-musicology?<br/>Eco-musicology seeks to emphasize the dependence of musical creativity on the<br/>auditory environments existing in the sites of particular cultures. This<br/>relationship is easily noticeable in cultures of low level of technological<br/>development, where people spend much time outdoors, listening and singing under an<br/>open sky. One example of such a culture is that of the Kaluli people of the<br/>rainforest in Papua New Guinea-studied by Steven Feld (Feld: 1982, 1994). What<br/>raised the Kaluli to international stardom amongst the environmentalists,<br/>critical musicologists, and cognitive psychologists, to mention just three groups of<br/>their fans, was their close association with the endangered habitat of the<br/>rainforest and the relationship between the natural soundscapes and forms of<br/>their cultural expression, including song and the creation of such unique notions<br/>as &quot;flow&quot; and &quot;lift-up-over-sounding&quot; in their musical language.<br/>The question arises, though, whether the Kaluli involvement in acoustic<br/>environment is unique; whether this culture is too primitive to have any<br/>significance for the study of music as art? The answer should be negative if there were<br/>other cases of such direct involvement of people with their environment, and<br/>if one could describe with certainty the metamorphosis of music under the<br/>conditions of changing environment. An interesting case is provided by the<br/>inhabitants of northern area of Lapland which spans northern Norway, Sweden and<br/>Finland around the Arctic Circle (Edstrom). The song of the nomadic Sami people,<br/>called the Yoyk or joik originated outdoors, in solitude with nature while<br/>tending herds of reindeer. As Edstrom writes, &quot;the joiks are directed to different<br/>phenomena in nature: to mountains, fairies, animals, insets, and, not the<br/>least, to people themselves.&quot; In joiks, the singer expressed his/her understanding<br/>of the world, of different people, animal species, land geography, and so<br/>forth. The melody of &quot;bird&quot; joiks was derived directly from the birdsong. These<br/>songs were sung with tight larynx, in a timbre suitable to be heard against the<br/>wind. Edstrom cites early derogatory descriptions of this music which,<br/>according to one account &quot;sounds like dogs howling&apos; (Edstrom p. 13). Despite the<br/>southerners dislike of Sami&apos;s music, their description confirmed persistence of an<br/>unusual vocal technique used to sing the joiks with &quot;restricted pitch,<br/>stretched vocal chords, closed throat and often with the mouth barely open&quot; (p. 13).<br/>However, after profound social changes, and the abandonment of the nomadic<br/>life-style by the prevailing part of the population, the Sami&apos;s unique vocal<br/>technique has all but disappeared. In various examples of cross-over musics<br/>(mixing joiks with pop, rock, symphonic styles of accompaniment), only pitch<br/>contours of the folksong remained, rendering the music almost unrecognizable. The<br/>sonorous image of music created outdoors, in the acoustic coupling with the<br/>environment, was not preserved in later, eclectic recordings. The music evolved<br/>because of the transformation of the acoustic environment caused by social<br/>factors: change of work patterns, settling down in permanent communities where<br/>people&apos;s homes are filled with objects, including stereos and recordings of the<br/>Western (sometimes country-and-western) musics.<br/>V.<br/>The research of Feld and Edstrom, which might be considered as<br/>exemplification&apos;s of eco-musicology, belongs in the domain of cultural anthropology or<br/>ethnomusicology. Indeed, the two e-musicologies have several points in common. For<br/>instance, an ethnomusicological textbook begins with the following claims:<br/>&quot;Like all of expressive culture, music is a peculiarly human adaptation to life<br/>on planet earth.... Each music culture is a particular adaptation to particular<br/>circumstances&quot; (Slobin and Titon 1992). Ethnomusicology studies music in<br/>culture or music as culture. Music ecology is narrower, in that it focuses on the<br/>acoustic phenomena of sound and its existence, production, interaction in<br/>culture; it also highlights the music&apos;s symbolic and cognitive connection to the<br/>environment. Eco-musicology maintains that in music, globalization should not<br/>mean conquest leading to the eradication of local traditions. Thus, two<br/>premises of eco-musicology are interconnected: (a) the end of the hegemony of Western<br/>art music in cultural discourse, (b) the tolerance and openness to various<br/>forms of musical life, including those traditionally studied by ethnomusicology,<br/>music theory, and historical musicology.<br/>Here, we find ourselves on the postmodern ground: the relativisation and<br/>contextualisation of values, the fragmentation of the one art of music into<br/>various synchronous and asynchronous musics, the plurality and diversity of<br/>cultures. The difference is in the ecomusicological emphasis on the sonorous, in the<br/>attention to features of music as performed and heard, not written down and<br/>talked about. A similarity between eco- and ethno-approaches stems from the<br/>triple ecological principle of diversity, complexity, symbiosis. If these are main<br/>values informing the co-existence of the world&apos;s musical cultures, any attempt<br/>at cultural hegemony, such as the one undertaken by the Western music<br/>industry flooding the globe with sounds and images manufactured in one country<br/>(Michael Jackson, Madonna), should be greeted with profound suspicion. There is no<br/>room for diversity and symbiosis in a situation of such transnational cultural<br/>dominance. Eco-musicology values pluralism of cultural expressions, just as<br/>ecophilosophy upheld the right of all species to a full realization of their<br/>potential. Similarly, ethnomusicologists would want to be very sensitive to such<br/>issues of colonial hegemony and defend the right of indigenous and endangered<br/>small cultures to exist and flourish.<br/>Vl.<br/>Westerners&apos; delight in discovering the musical cultures of the gentle<br/>children of Nature living in a symbiotic relationship with their environment of a<br/>rainforest or a northern tundra, might be seen as a realization of the Romantic<br/>postulates of Jean&#x1F;Jacques Rousseau to return to Nature and scorn the damaging<br/>influence of civilization. There is, indeed, more than a trace of such Nature<br/>worship in the mystique of the rainsforest, portrayed as a present-day<br/>paradise which is threatened with destruction. Some environmentalist deplore all<br/>traces of human presence in or interaction with nature, and value only the &quot;pure<br/>unspoiled beauty&quot; of non-human life. The music of the tribes and nations living<br/>in close relationship with their environment is often considered valuable<br/>because of this relationship, not because of any particuarly intrinsic &quot;musical&quot;<br/>features. For instance, R. Murray Schafer thus describes the experience of<br/>performing on a &quot;natural&quot; instrument, made of a reed, wood or animal skin<br/>(Schafer: 1993). If you think of a musical instrument as something which came from<br/>nature and is still part of nature and still fells itself part of nature, every<br/>time you perform on it, you are indulging in a very wistful, very romantic<br/>ideal of bringing nature back to life. I don&apos;t think the same thing exists with<br/>plastic instruments or electronic instruments. There&apos;s a very big difference<br/>between an lndian who beats a drum, and the drum is made from the skin of an<br/>animal that he has killed, and the animal is his totem. he plays that drum and<br/>its voice is the voice of the animal that speaks to him as he plays.<br/>It is more difficult to establish the connection between the soundscape and<br/>the music of Western art tradition. Here, thousands of years of isolation of<br/>music from the external soundscape resulted in creating a self-referential<br/>domain of music relating only and solely to other musics, a domain with sharp<br/>distinctions between what is musical and non-musical. Primarily, to put it simply,<br/>pitch is musical, while non-pitched, percussive timbres are admitted into the<br/>domain of music only tentatively, as ornaments not as essential elements of<br/>sound material. A clear-cut division between the musical and unmusical appears,<br/>for instance, in various theories of musical space, the space of tones<br/>projected in time, the virtual space distinguished from the auditory space of<br/>everyday noises surrouding the listeners in their physical environment (Harley:<br/>1994a). In the Western tradition, music is thought of as much more than sounds; it<br/>is the abstract structure superimposed on and mediated through sonorous<br/>sequences that makes these sounds worthy of our attention. Music is--as it were--not<br/>heard, but imagined. Challenges to this conceptual tradition came from<br/>various directions: the futurists and the discovery of &quot;the musical&quot; in noise, the<br/>impressionists and the discovery of &quot;the musical&quot; beyond the sense allowed this<br/>word in a narrow European art music tradition.<br/>Varese&apos;s use of percussion, Cowell&apos;s New Music Resouces, Cage&apos;s play with the<br/>radios, musiq&apos;e concrete, electronic instruments and experiments, the<br/>loudspeaker revolution --all these occurrences influenced a change in the<br/>understanding of the limits of &quot;music.&quot; It is impossible even to list the main stages of<br/>this evolution in one brief paper. What needs to be pointed out, however, is<br/>the fact that the widening of the area of &quot;musical&quot; sounds happened<br/>simultaneously with the recovery of the mimetic principle by composers, or, rather, with<br/>the shift away from the romantic emotive response to nature towards the use of<br/>&quot;natural&quot; models and laws as structural frameworks for the music&apos;s<br/>construction. This idea preoccupies Franc,ois-Bernard Mache&apos;s (Mache: 1983/1992).<br/>The composer finds, for instance, many analogies between birdsong and human<br/>music. He describes various instances of the birds&apos; musical creativity and<br/>seeks to prove that it is &quot;somewhat ill-founded to continue to define the cultural<br/>domain in radical opposition to the natural&quot; (p. 157). Animals are not<br/>machines, for they display invention; moreover, neither human nor animalian music<br/>can be defined as a system of communication. According to Mache, the polarity of<br/>mind and body and the polarity of nature and culture are equally useless (p.<br/>166). All living beings are a part of nature, all are affected by climate and<br/>environment: &quot;man and animal reveal the acoustic influence of the world in<br/>which they live&quot; (p. 151). Music should be--here, the composer&apos;s voice changes<br/>from descriptive to prescriptive--based on auditory models borrowed from the<br/>environment, it should recover its sensory contact with the world. For Mache,<br/>music is a tool of knowledge &quot;the tool of apprehension, of comprehension, even,<br/>of the world, at the same time as of pleasure&quot;(p. 169).<br/>VII.<br/>Francois-Bernard Mache was neither the first, nor the only composer<br/>preoccupied with exploding the borders between music and the &quot;external world&quot; of<br/>Nature. Mache himself quotes the importance of Czech language for Leos Janacek,<br/>chaotic crowd sounds for Iannis Xenakis, birdsong for Olivier Messiaen, sounds of<br/>the night for Bela Bartok (Harley: 1994b, 1995). The latter composer&apos;s<br/>interest in Nature as a creative force is particularly intersting in this context:<br/>Bartok&apos;s music seems to have been modelled structurally on natural laws and<br/>phenomena, such as the Golden Section, approximated by the Fibonacci series. For<br/>Bartok, these natural phenomena include folk music of the peasants who live a<br/>life coordinated with and ruled by Nature. Among living composers, whose<br/>musical activities involve a return to the Earth, and to the small communities<br/>living in close proximity and interaction with their environments, Peter Maxwell<br/>Davies, now settled at one of the Orkney Islands, pursues an expressive ideal of<br/>environmental or eco-oriented music, bringing the sound world of the sea into<br/>the concert hall (Matthews: 1992). His undertaking, much like the music of<br/>Frederic Delius, results in a new series of representations of natural sounds<br/>and soundscapes with symphonic means.<br/>Music ecology transcend the domain of &quot;ecological music&quot; for it purports to<br/>study music beyond the notes, the music of the total perceptual experience.<br/>Here, the psychoacoustic bent is strongly felt because of the focus on sonority<br/>(the types of sounds, their similarity to other existing sounds, the types of<br/>procedures for sound transformation, organization, creation of meaning). A<br/>fully-articulated theory of music&#x1F;in-its-sounding-form is yet to be developed.<br/>Here, the methodology of auditory scene analysis developed by Albert Bregman<br/>seems to offer a particularly fruitful direction for future research. The focus<br/>should remain on the audible, not visible, reality of music which lives in sound.<br/>In the 19th century, the philosophy of nature presupposed a deep,<br/>unbreachable chasm between the thinking subject and the external natural world. According<br/>to Charles Taylor (Taylor: 1989), the romantic orientation to nature is<br/>concerned &quot;with the sentiments which nature awakens in us&quot; (p. 297); for the<br/>romantic &quot;nature is like a great keyboard on which our highest sentiments are played<br/>out.&quot; As Taylor writes, &quot;in our civilisation, moulded by expressivist<br/>conceptions, art has come to take a central place in our spiritual life, in some<br/>respect replacing religion&quot; (p. 376). Art, located on &quot;the border of the numinous&quot;<br/>was awarded a crucial place of creating expression in human life, crucial,<br/>because &quot;expressive individuation has become one of the cornerstones of modern<br/>culture&quot; (p. 376). The 20th century saw all dreams shattered, all identities<br/>fragmented. In music, the conceptual reformulations reached the zero-level of<br/>total absence of created sound, total presence of envrionmental sound in works<br/>by John Cage. The postmodern plurality of styles became obligatory at a time<br/>when composers, to quote Francois-Bernard Mache, willingly rushed &quot;towards the<br/>encyclopedias, exhaustive catalogues, retrospectives, exhumations&quot; because they<br/>no longer believed in the music&apos;s future (Mache: 178). While avoiding that<br/>ecological or environmental music sought the utopia of a pure unspoiled nature<br/>in (1) the portrayals or quotations of environmental sounds, (2) the use of<br/>acoustic instruments in live performance, (3) the transference of music into<br/>outdoor environments (performance in total unity with the Earth).<br/>This is a new dream, arising at a time of technological overkill, of<br/>overabundance of noise, artificiality of synthetic and amplified sounds. While<br/>ecological music pursues such dreams of primal wholeness, music ecology seeks to<br/>articulate the ties between nature and culture; it attempts to recover the<br/>correspondence between natural phenomena and human affairs. The modern and romantic<br/>separation of nature from culture is a dangerous illusion; if culture is for<br/>humans here and now and nature there and then, there is a need to recover this<br/>lost unity, a possibility of return to a closeness with the trees--through,<br/>say, travel to the rainforest. In contrast, ecophilosophy claims that nature is<br/>always mediated through culture and that envisioning cultures without their<br/>natural components impoverishes the breadth of human experience. Life on Earth is<br/>a series of networks of interrelationships; the existence of pure, unspoilt<br/>beauty of exclusively &quot;natural&quot; worlds and of completely autonomous and<br/>art)ficial human cultures are equally dubious.<br/>With its emphasis on interrelationship between the sonorities of music and of<br/>the environment, eco-musicology eschews the separation between human and<br/>non-human environments. After all, music in performance is an element of<br/>soundscape, a vital sonic bubble surrounding various cultures with an unmistakable<br/>layer of sound. Schafer defines soundscape as &quot;a field of interactions&quot; (Schafer:<br/>1977, 131). At the centre of this field is located a living, hearing human<br/>being who defines his or her auditory space and environment through decisions and<br/>acts of directed attention, of sound production or perception. The<br/>flourishing of this individual human self is mediated through connectedness, in a<br/>growing awareness of the relational field of existence embracing all forms of life.</p><p>------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>NOTE:<br/>An earlier version of this paper was read at the Spring Meeting of the New<br/>York State-&#x1F;St. Lawrence Chapter of the American Musicological Society, Ottawa,<br/>8-9 April, 1995.</p><p>------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>REFERENCES<br/>Bloom, Harold. 1994.

Chopin Academy of Music Warsaw,<br/>Poland). After earning her doctorate (with the dissertation on &quot;Space and<br/>spatialization in contemporary music: History and analysis, ideas and<br/>implementations&quot;), she received a SSHRC Post- doctoral Fellowship to study contemporary<br/>Polish music at McGill University, in association with the University of Warsaw<br/>(1994-1996). Since August 1996, she is the Director of the Polish Music<br/>Reference Center and an Assistant Professor of musicology at the School of Music<br/>University of Southern California, Los Angeles. As a musicologist specializing in<br/>20th-century music, Dr. Harley is particularly intere- sted in philosophical<br/>and perceptual aspects of music making, in the composers&apos; concepts of nature<br/>and soundscape, the role of spatial sound in musical composition, as well as in<br/>the connection between music and ecology. She has published articles on<br/>Bartok, Xenakis, Andriessen, Bacewicz, Brant, Schafer and others, and dealt with<br/>issues of musical spatialization, birdsong portrayal in music, Catholic<br/>mysticism, site-specific music, women composers, acoustic ecology, etc. She has also<br/>presented papers at many international conferences in England, Hungary, Germany,<br/>the U.S., and Canada.</p></div>
