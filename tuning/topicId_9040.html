Its very<br/>absence of rules is what makes it attractive. On the other hand, should<br/>people be aware that it is not a private conversation they are having? One<br/>forgets - it is so much easier to write an email than make a call or write a<br/>letter, but should one use this in order to avoid more difficult but<br/>necessary communications? Are we being alienated by the convenience of Email?<br/>Is the use of Email in matters of more emotional nature appropriate?  Is it<br/>vulgar to have an argument over the Email, or express deeper layers? Is it<br/>gauche to get emotional in Email form? It might be.  For privacy reasons,<br/>obviously, but further, because it is just too easy. Too cheap!  It is<br/>perfect for intellectual communications, but by nature an Email is &quot;light and<br/>quick&quot; and anything that requires more intense communication should be done<br/>via other media. Sending an angry email is crude. The content does not fit<br/>the form.<br/>Another matter of etiquette is pornography on the Internet.  I personally<br/>don&apos;t have any objections to what people want to do with themselves on their<br/>sites or what they are willing to show, for money or for free, but to me it<br/>is a question of style, of fit. Freedom brings everything out in a chaotic<br/>manner but one has to sort things out, at some point. Some things just aren&apos;t<br/>fitting.</p></div>
