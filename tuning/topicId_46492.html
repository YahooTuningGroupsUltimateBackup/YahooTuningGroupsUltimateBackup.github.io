I have found that<br/>when companies say that they emulate another product, it is best to<br/>get the other product.</p><p>I have Sibelius 2 and PhotoScore.  Sibelius 2 does not handle lyrics<br/>nearly so well as NoteWorthy Composer does; lyrics are now passable<br/>as part of the MIDI standard.  Each musical voice gets up to 8<br/>lyrical lines in Composer.  Sibelius 2 is nice for working with<br/>scores produced by others.  PhotoScore usually demands so much<br/>proofing and corrections that I wish I had just keyed the piece into<br/>Composer in the first place, so I rarely use PhotoScore anymore.</p><p>Nice BBS tags are available from</p><p>     <a href="http://www.theafterglowlounge.com/Home.asp">http://www.theafterglowlounge.com/Home.asp</a></p><p>via</p><p>     music | tags | (Tag of the Month)/(Tag Archive)</p><p>If anybody puts any of those or other Barbershop songs into JI,<br/>Pythagorean, or any other interesting tuning, please post the results.</p><p>     Thanks,</p><p>              Steve</p></div><h3>monz@attglobal.net</h3><span>8/21/2003 9:11:12 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>hi Steve,</p><p>&gt; -----Original Message-----<br/>&gt; From: slangford97 [<a href="mailto:s@TheRiver.com">mailto:s@TheRiver.com</a>]<br/>&gt; Sent: Thursday, August 21, 2003 7:23 PM<br/>&gt; To: <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a><br/>&gt; Subject: [tuning] Joplin, Barbershop, .PDFs, PhotoScore, Acrobat, and<br/>&gt; BBS tags:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Has anybody a score from which Joplin sang in Barbershop?</p><p>as i said, i have scores of his songs, but they are<br/>all published in piano/vocal format.  none of them<br/>were published in actual barbershop quartet format.<br/>but it&apos;s fairly easy to reconstruct from the chord movement.</p><p>i&apos;m willing to do it ... it&apos;s just a matter of<br/>when i can find the time.</p><p>-monz</p></div><h3>Gene Ward Smith &#x3C;gwsmith@svpal.org&#x3E;</h3><span>8/21/2003 10:31:42 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;slangford97&quot; &lt;s@T...&gt; wrote:</p><p>&gt; If anybody puts any of those or other Barbershop songs into JI,<br/>&gt; Pythagorean, or any other interesting tuning, please post the<br/>results.</p><p>I plan on looking into it; I&apos;m awaiting a report from Manuel on why<br/>my scanned midi file did not get along with Scala.</p></div><h3>Manuel Op de Coul &#x3C;manuel.op.de.coul@eon-benelux.com&#x3E;</h3><span>8/22/2003 3:24:43 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Gene wrote:<br/>&gt;I plan on looking into it; I&apos;m awaiting a report from Manuel on why<br/>&gt;my scanned midi file did not get along with Scala.</p><p>I found it.
