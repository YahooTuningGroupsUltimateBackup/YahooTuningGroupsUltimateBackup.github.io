I wrote the article, in a hurry, based on the charts<br/>at...</p><p><a href="http://lumma.org/Gd.zip">http://lumma.org/Gd.zip</a></p><p>...which are correct, or should be, since the data was generated by my<br/>computer.</p><p>&gt;&gt;Degrees 1-4-7-9 give three 4:5:6:7 and three 10:12:15:17 tetrads.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;Why do you call them 10:12:15:17 tetrads and not 1/(4:5:6:7) tetrads?</p><p>In this search, I simply picked some chords I was interested in, and tuned<br/>them in my favorite ET&apos;s, if they were consistently represtented.  If an ET<br/>confounded a pair of chords, I recognized only the interpretation with the<br/>lowest RMS error.  It&apos;s all in the text files on my web server.</p><p>&gt;What about the symmetrical decatonic scale, where 1-4-7-9 gives _four_<br/>&gt;4:5:6:7s and _four_ 1/(4:5:6:7)s?</p><p>What about it?</p><p>&gt;And how about the diminished scale in 12-tET (or 28-tET, etc.) where 1-4-7<br/>&gt;gives four 3:4:5 triads and four 1/(3:4:5) triads?</p><p>Sounds cool!  How does the scale go?</p><p>&gt;And how about the 14-out-of-26 scale I&apos;ve discussed?</p><p>That&apos;s cool too.  Maybe I&apos;ll run it up.  The search was mainly intended to<br/>check out some of the scales that were given passing mention on the list in<br/>the last year.  I already knew, from your paper, that the 14-of-26 had the<br/>property I was looking for.  I should also run up Graham&apos;s neutral-third<br/>heptatonics and decatonics.</p><p>-Carl</p></div>
