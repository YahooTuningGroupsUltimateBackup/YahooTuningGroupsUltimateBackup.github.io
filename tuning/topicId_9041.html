If a particular alternate tuning happens to become<br/>&quot;chic&quot; for a time and then passes, that would in no way kill the &quot;microtonal<br/>movement&quot;. The worst thing for the microtonal movement right now is the<br/>hegemony of 12-tET in the Western conservatory tradition, by which the vast<br/>majority of musicians and composers are taught that there are only 12 notes<br/>and everything else is an &quot;inflection&quot; at best.</p></div>
