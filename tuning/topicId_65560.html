From my own perspective, it doesn&apos;t sound &quot;microtonal,&quot; so to speak, and perhaps that&apos;s because, as Gene mentioned a while back, music based off of 5 limit intervals doesn&apos;t seem &quot;weird&quot; or different, since 12 eq is based off the same sort of system. And I&apos;ve been listening to Ravi Shankar since 1968, but never really thought of the tuning much, even though I knew, intellectually, that Indian music had &quot;quartertones&quot; (as I used to think of it way back).<br/>  And, speaking of Shankar, he&apos;s done numerous collaborations with Western musicians over the years, including Yehudi Menuhin and the LA Philharmonic, so the tuning systems must be pretty close in ways for it to work...and I am supposing that Shankar either tweaks his pitches a bit to make that work, or just plows ahead with the way he would usually do it...what do you think?<br/>  But, as far as 5 limit goes, I believe Arabic music (and I know that covers a lot of territory) is based off 5ths as well, but a lot of oud music DOES sound different to my ears, I can really hear microtonal inflections. Of course, it&apos;s often quite subtle, and my hearing has deepened a lot since I started playing non 12 music.<br/>  It&apos;s interesting; Jon Catler&apos;s 31 tone rock stuff (Cowpeople), from what I recall, at times sounds really different from 12, but a couple of the pieces sounded very &quot;normal,&quot; but I haven&apos;t heard it in a while. His &quot;Crash Landing&quot; CD sounds REALLY out, and there&apos;s no doubt it&apos;s something not in the ordinary. It&apos;s a subject with many different takes, for sure, and a worthwhile topic to chat about...see you...HHH<br/><a href="http://microstick.net">microstick.net</a><br/>PS...whether it&apos;s the tuning or not, a good friend of mine (who&apos;s a wayway out there guitarist as well) once told me that my piece &quot;The Spider&quot; (from &quot;Other Worlds&quot;), which is in 19 eq, was one of the only pieces of music he ever heard that actually scared him...</p></div>
