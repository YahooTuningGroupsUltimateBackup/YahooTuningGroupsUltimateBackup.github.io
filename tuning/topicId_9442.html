I reran the program that created this chart on a faster<br/>machine with a much finer sieve, and discovered that there are more transition<br/>points than given in the file. So the implied suggestion that it&apos;s complete<br/>is indeed wrong. There are transition points which are less than 0.00001 cents<br/>apart. I shall post a new file some time. The difference is only of theoretical<br/>interest.</p><p>Manuel Op de Coul    <a href="mailto:coul@ezh.nl">coul@ezh.nl</a></p></div>
