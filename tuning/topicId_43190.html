The former at least is still active.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; -Carl</p><p>Hi Paul Erlich ??</p><p>Good day!</p><p>You know something....I didn&apos;t make the connection! When I asked you<br/>for a shorter name (and you responded &quot;Paul&quot;), I didn&apos;t realize that<br/>you are &quot;The&quot; Paul Erlich. If this is the case, I&apos;ve been posting<br/>messages to you going waaaaay back.</p><p>I was also wondering whatever happened to &quot;emotionaljourney22&quot;. That<br/>was you too?</p><p>Most times, I wonder what happened to members who contributed so much<br/>and then just seem to disappear. Maybe they are also under a<br/>different name?</p><p>I too added to the confusion when I was calling myself &quot;Wally&quot;.<br/>Wally is the name I grew up with. Its &quot;short&quot; for Walter. I stoppped<br/>using it on the tuning group to avoid confusion with your present<br/>name &quot;Wallyesterpaulrus&quot;. I&apos;m cool with using &quot;Walter&quot;.</p><p>I&apos;ve also tried to change &quot;electricwally77&quot; which is my Yahoo ID. I<br/>used that name for a web page I had on teaching &quot;slide guitar&quot;. Yahoo<br/>won&apos;t let me change it unless I create a whole new profile. Oh well...</p><p>Maybe we could all somehow use a &quot;solid&quot; identity of some sort so we<br/>all know who&apos;s who? But then again, maybe a floating &quot;identity&quot; is<br/>what some prefer. That&apos;s cool too.</p><p>Not that any of the above really matters. Just a thought. Now back to<br/>tuning!</p></div><h3><a id=43213 href="#43213">ðŸ”—</a>Joseph Pehrson &#x3C;jpehrson@rcn.com&#x3E;</h3><span>4/2/2003 7:45:57 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;Walter Lepore&quot; &lt;earth7@o...&gt; wrote:</p><p><a href="/tuning/topicId_43190.html#43201">/tuning/topicId_43190.html#43201</a></p><p>&gt; Maybe we could all somehow use a &quot;solid&quot; identity of some sort so<br/>we all know who&apos;s who?</p><p>***Maybe we could all just use some semblance of our names.
