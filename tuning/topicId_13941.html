If I can hard-code all the amplitudes to 1 it will make my code a<br/>&gt;*lot* simpler.</p><p>Hi Ed.</p><p>Bill e-mailed me off-list to tell me that the &quot;amplitudes&quot; are in dB and not<br/>really amplitudes at all. The conversion from amplitude to dB is dB =<br/>10*log(amp)/log(10) + c, where c is a level-setting constant.</p><p>Now there&apos;s something about the results that worries me . . . for example,<br/>if I run the program for a triangle wave (where the &quot;amplitude&quot; of the<br/>harmonics decreases at 6 dB/octave) with a certain fundamental dB and then<br/>for a square wave (where the &quot;amplitude&quot; of the harmonics decreases at 3<br/>dB/octave) with half the fundamental dB, I get identical curves, other than<br/>scaling. However, if I use a fixed waveform and simply adjust the volume up<br/>or down (by adding a constant to all the dBs), I get very different curves.<br/>Is that the way it&apos;s supposed to work, Bill?</p></div>
