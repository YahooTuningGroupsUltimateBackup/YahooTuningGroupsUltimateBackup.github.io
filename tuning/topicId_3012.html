I used specific symbols for the days of the week, that<br/>&gt;derive from astrological planet symbols (you&apos;ll recognise Tuesday as &quot;Male&quot;<br/>&gt;and Friday as &quot;Female&quot;).</p><p>Male and Mars are the same symbol and so are the days, so I just<br/>accepted them as the days.  I did actually look at it all, but it was<br/>just my sense of humour that got the better of me and I wanted to see<br/>the pattern of mapping frequency to time completed by making the sharps<br/>and flats earlier and later in the day.  I still kind of like the idea<br/>that the 7th chord will produce a sort of Friday midnight snack.  Sorry,<br/>no offense intended it is just that I have a warped mind.</p><p>I applaud any notation that makes the exact meaning of the frequency of<br/>every note perfectly clear, however I also prefer a notation which is<br/>really easy to remember.  For that reason I think that something like<br/>the one I just posted is preferable (although some of the combined<br/>symbols could be abbreviated, e.g. * for #- or &apos; for #^) ...</p><p>Note   C    D    E    F    G    A    B<br/>Ratio  1   9/8  5/4  4/3  3/2  5/3  15/8</p><p>Notation     #         b      +      -      ^      v<br/>Meaning   135/128  128/135  81/80  80/81  64/63  63/64</p><p>Notation     #-     b+     bv     #^<br/>Meaning    25/24  24/25  14/15  15/14   etc.</p><p>This could be extended to 11 and 13 ratios also.</p><p>So for example 10/9 is D- because (9/8)*(80/81)=10/9.</p><p>I find this easy to remember because ...</p><p>. The meaning of # and b are totally standard</p><p>. The + and - are the most common shifts due to modulations</p><p>. The ^ and v point up and down and also look a bit like a 7 at an angle<br/>and they are the ones that are due to a 7 ratio being introduced.</p><p>-- Ray Tomes -- <a href="http://www.kcbbs.gen.nz/users/rtomes/rt-home.htm">http://www.kcbbs.gen.nz/users/rtomes/rt-home.htm</a> --<br/>   Cycles email list -- <a href="http://www.kcbbs.gen.nz/users/af/cyc.htm">http://www.kcbbs.gen.nz/users/af/cyc.htm</a><br/>Alexandria eGroup list -- <a href="http://www.kcbbs.gen.nz/users/af/alex.htm">http://www.kcbbs.gen.nz/users/af/alex.htm</a><br/>Boundaries of Science <a href="http://www.kcbbs.gen.nz/users/af/scienceb.htm">http://www.kcbbs.gen.nz/users/af/scienceb.htm</a></p></div><h3><a id=3037 href="#3037">ðŸ”—</a>Azi Vajravai &#x3C;vajravai@xxxxxxx.xxxx&#x3E;</h3><span>5/14/1999 12:20:49 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Ray, I appreciate the humor...  and like I said...  if I had symbols for<br/>parts of the day....  then a chord could produce having a breakfast at<br/>Denny&apos;s at 4 AM after one hell of a party on Thursday night, and you&apos;re<br/>really debating going to work the next morning...</p><p>I think that&apos;s a strange diminished chord or something.<br/>;)</p><p>The silly thing about email is that a sly and funny remark looks identical<br/>to a snide and sarcastic one.</p><p>So...  smile when you say that - jerk! ;) &lt;---emoticon...

For that reason<br/>things like &quot;^&quot; and &quot;v&quot; are good because they are on the computer<br/>whereas the mars and venus ones (see I didn&apos;t mention sex :) are not<br/>part of the standard character set and most of us wouldn&apos;t know how to<br/>get them to save our lives (and even if we did they would likely come up<br/>weird on another brand of computer).</p><p>-- Ray Tomes -- <a href="http://www.kcbbs.gen.nz/users/rtomes/rt-home.htm">http://www.kcbbs.gen.nz/users/rtomes/rt-home.htm</a> --<br/>   Cycles email list -- <a href="http://www.kcbbs.gen.nz/users/af/cyc.htm">http://www.kcbbs.gen.nz/users/af/cyc.htm</a><br/>Alexandria eGroup list -- <a href="http://www.kcbbs.gen.nz/users/af/alex.htm">http://www.kcbbs.gen.nz/users/af/alex.htm</a><br/>Boundaries of Science <a href="http://www.kcbbs.gen.nz/users/af/scienceb.htm">http://www.kcbbs.gen.nz/users/af/scienceb.htm</a></p></div>
