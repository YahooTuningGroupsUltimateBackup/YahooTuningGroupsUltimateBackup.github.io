And the contentious<br/>note seems to be Dha (A), because Sa (C), Re (D), Ga (E) and Pa (G)<br/>are already acceptably established, as mentioned by you above.</p><p>In deskar, the glide from Sa (C) of the higher octeve to Dha (A), and<br/>back to Sa (C) of the higher octave -- is very frequently performed.<br/>Could it be, that the phrase E-G-A-G-E (typical of Bhupali) uses the<br/>lower shruti of A, than that used in Deskar, which uses the glide<br/>from Sa (C) of the higher octeve to Dha (A), and back to Sa (C) of<br/>the highr octave?</p><p>Though such phenomena take place commonly and naturally, yet they are<br/>not mentioned or discussed anywhere in Indian musical texts -- the<br/>singer goes by his sense of aesthetics. It is always desirable to try<br/>to give scientific basis to any such aesthetical and intuitive<br/>processes -- if we can.</p><p>Regards,<br/>Haresh.</p></div><h3><a id=29108 href="#29108">ðŸ”—</a>Paul Erlich &#x3C;paul@stretch-music.com&#x3E;</h3><span>10/13/2001 11:23:43 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In tuning@y..., &quot;Haresh BAKSHI&quot; &lt;hareshbakshi@h...&gt; wrote:</p><p>&gt; Though such phenomena take place commonly and naturally, yet they are<br/>&gt; not mentioned or discussed anywhere in Indian musical texts -- the<br/>&gt; singer goes by his sense of aesthetics.
