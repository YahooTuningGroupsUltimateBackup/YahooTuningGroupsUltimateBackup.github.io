No unofficial reference I&apos;ve ever seen mentions this.  The de facto standard certainly ignores it, because it&apos;s commonplace for sequencers to allow you to record all channels in a single track (although not usually in a very convenient manner).</p><p>Yes, score writing programs ask for format 1 because that&apos;s the right thing to do.  It tells them what stave to put each piece on.  The channel numbers can&apos;t tell you this because you may have a MIDI guitar outputting to 6 different channels, for example.  But hey, maybe they smoked some really good crack when the drew up the standard and made the tracks completely redundant.  Fortunately most people ignore them in that case.</p><p>MIDI Relay puts multiple channels into a track.

I didn&apos;t know that had happened . . . thanks Manuel! I<br/>think<br/>&gt; &gt; some cleaning-up should be done, though. For instance, under 22<br/>we<br/>&gt; &gt; have<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; 3 4 3 3 3 3 3  Twenty-two tone Miller&apos;s Porcupine-7 Major<br/>&gt; &gt; 3 3 1 3 3 3 3 3  Twenty-two tone Jones&apos;s Porcupine-8<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; But under 15 we have<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; 2 2 2 3 2 2 2  Fifteen-tone Miller&apos;s Porcupine-7<br/>&gt; &gt; 2 3 2 2 2 2 2  Fifteen-tone Miller&apos;s Porcupine-7 Major<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; Is Herman comfortable with these &quot;Major&quot; and &quot;Blank&quot; mode names?<br/>&gt; &gt; Shouldn&apos;t Igliashon&apos;s mode be listed under 15-equal too? And even<br/>if<br/>&gt; &gt; I was the one who introduced Herman (?) and Igs to these modes, I<br/>&gt; &gt; don&apos;t like a separate section with my name on it, especially when<br/>&gt; &gt; this section only lists the &quot;Blank&quot; mode out of those above . . .<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I don&apos;t recall having any names for these modes, although I&apos;ve used<br/>the<br/>&gt; traditional mode names like &quot;dorian&quot; and &quot;phrygian&quot; informally for<br/>&gt; non-diatonic modes, so it&apos;s possible I might have called this one<br/>&gt; &quot;major&quot; at some point. The connection between temperaments and MOS<br/>&gt; scales wasn&apos;t clear to me when I was writing 15-ET music, and I&apos;ve<br/>&gt; rarely used either of these modes. One 15-ET mode that I do have a<br/>name<br/>&gt; for is &quot;kusiro&quot;, 1 3 2 3 1 1 2 2. I probably had other 15-ET mode<br/>names<br/>&gt; at one time, but I&apos;ve moved a couple of times in the last few years<br/>and<br/>&gt; I&apos;m not sure where all my notes are.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Is either of these the mode used in &quot;Glassic&quot;? That would be a good<br/>name<br/>&gt; for the mode if it is.</p><p>Good point. The beginning and ending of &quot;Glassic&quot;, performed at the<br/>second AFMM Microthon, is in the 4 3 3 3 3 3 3 mode. Part of<br/>the &quot;Modal Improv&quot; Ara and I performed at the first AFMM Microthon<br/>was in the 3 3 3 4 3 3 3 mode.</p></div>
