If there is<br/>no drone, the just noticable difference for pitch is about 8 cents.</p></div><h3><a id=4769 href="#4769">ðŸ”—</a>Carl Lumma &#x3C;clumma@xxx.xxxx&#x3E;</h3><span>9/12/1999 7:25:30 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>&gt;The source for my above assertion is _Psychology of Music_ by Carl Seashore,<br/>&gt;pp. 56-62, McGraw-Hill 1938.  First, he defines the standard test for pitch<br/>&gt;discrimination as having a stimulus of &quot;sound[ing] two notes, each of<br/>which is<br/>&gt;one second in duration but differing in pitch and separated by a very short<br/>&gt;interval of time&quot;.  He cites a study by Strucker, Zsch. Sinnesphysiol., XLII,<br/>&gt;1908, where the pitch discrimination of 16 professional musicians in the<br/>Royal<br/>&gt;Opera in Vienna was measured (at 435 Hz).  Four of the subjects discriminated<br/>&gt;less than one cent, and five others within two cents (one cent at 435 Hz is<br/>&gt;very nearly 0.25 Hz).  Figure 1, page 60, also shows that pitch<br/>discrimination<br/>&gt;is actually about twice as fine at 2000 Hz as for 435 Hz.</p><p>Fred, do you know if this was done with pure tones, or...?</p></div>
