Compare the sound of 22-tet superpyth aeolian<br/>&gt; &gt; to 19-tet superpyth aeolian, and that still also &quot;works.&quot; And to my<br/>&gt; &gt; ears, at least, 7/6 and 6/5 are two different intervals.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Well, the H.E. curve is much flatter between 6/5 and 7/6 than it is between 6/5 and 5/4. Below 6/5, it seems like the transition between &quot;minor third&quot; and &quot;major second&quot; is a very smooth one, without a significant peak of &quot;what the hell IS that interval?&quot;. IOW, that whole region is already pretty high in discordance. Using the &quot;adjusted and inverted scale&quot; of H.E. that Steve M. just helped me work out, where a unison is 100 and a 51-cent quartertone is 0 (and an octave is 85, a fifth 50, etc.), 7/6 is about 23.74, 6/5 is about 25.91, and the &quot;dip&quot; between them is about 22.24 at about 288 cents. So the difference between local maxima and minima of H.E. in that region is very slight. OTOH, 5/4 scores about 30.3, and the valley (or peak, with the original H.E. numbers) between that and 6/5 is 18.73 at 350 cents; much more significant.</p><p>One thing that I think needs to be said here is - that HE was<br/>formulated from an information theory standpoint. It is an excellent<br/>model of concordance, or consonance, or whatever the word du jour is,<br/>and it&apos;s the first of its kind too. But I think there might be a few<br/>practical limitations that really prevent us from taking the leap that<br/>the graph is a perfect representation of concordance as it stands.</p><p>The first is that the graph changes with that s parameter. So if you<br/>make s low enough (or is it high enough? I never remember), you will<br/>indeed see distinct notches for 7/6, 5/4, and 11/9 too. It changes the<br/>shape of the curve.</p><p>The second thing is that the way that HE is currently formulated has a<br/>bit of arbitrariness to it. First you generate a Farey series up to<br/>some arbitrary limit, and then you arbitrarily decide that every<br/>interval has a &quot;domain&quot; equal to the distance between the mediant of<br/>the interval and it&apos;s lower neighbor, and the mediant of the interval<br/>and it&apos;s upper neighbor. Then you decide that the dyad coming in has a<br/>probability of being heard as ANY dyad and that that probability is<br/>represented with a Gaussian curve, and then you do the classical<br/>information theory entropy calculation.</p><p>So while it&apos;s an elegant idea, there are enough arbitrary aspects to<br/>it that I would take the curve with a grain of salt. It&apos;s good for<br/>getting a general idea of what&apos;s going on - that 5/4 is concordant,<br/>and less concordant than 3/2; and that 6/5 is less concordant than<br/>5/4, and the space between them is some kind of local entropy maximum,<br/>etc. But when you start getting into very small and fine details like<br/>that - keep in mind it&apos;s really just a very basic, rough model<br/>(although I can&apos;t praise Paul enough for coming up with it).</p><p>A while ago I came up with an alternative formulation for the HE curve<br/>that would model a filterbank of combination-sensitive neurons in the<br/>brain, and see how many fire for any given dyad (more firing strongly<br/>= higher entropy). ome day I&apos;ll get it finished. I&apos;m interested to see<br/>how it would match up with Paul&apos;s. I expect they&apos;d look extremely<br/>similar, but that there might be small differences.</p><p>You might also note that sometimes, as I said earlier - the &quot;flip<br/>flopping&quot; between intervals at an area of maximum entropy might be<br/>because we&apos;re using different diatonic (or whatever) maps to try and<br/>place the interval.

It is their psychoacoustic spacing that matters, not so much their actual low harmonic entropy. This is what makes them ideal. 12-tET could be another sort of ideal, since the space between 200, 300, 400, and 500 cents is all equal and as wide as possible. But the point is that the spacing doesn&apos;t HAVE to be ideal, it just has to be enough for us to tell the difference.

They are important because they are the values the thirds have to be distinguished from in order NOT to sound like 5-EDO. But of course I&apos;m not talking about exact 4/3 or 9/8, because the diatonic scale only requires an approximate 3/2 as its generator.  Of course, like I said, because the period is an octave, we can also use the octave-inversion of a 3/2, which will invert the generator/period coordinates.</p><p>&gt; &gt; It&apos;s like holograms.

A chromatic half step would be<br/>&gt; L-s, so you&apos;d be able to get chromatic (and hyperchromatic) scales<br/>&gt; too.</p><p>But just having L &amp; s doesn&apos;t tell you anything about the order of them; you could end up with LsLLLLs or LssLLLL.  Also, you have to stipulate that the scale will repeat at the octave, or else there&apos;s nothing to stop you from making scales like ssLsLssL.  Also, defining sizes of L &amp; s according to JI doesn&apos;t work.  For instance, 22-EDO would be out of the question as a diatonic scale, since its L is very far from 10/9 (it more approximates 9/8 and 8/7) and its s does not REMOTELY approximate 16/15.  Looking at just those values, you&apos;d think that 2\22-EDO would be a better s, but then you&apos;d end up with 11-EDO.  If you really wanted to use L &amp; s to generate the scale, you&apos;d have to specify their size such that 5L+2s equals a 2/1.  But then, you&apos;d have no way to rule out a scale where L = 239 cents and s = 2.5 cents (or something), which definitely wouldn&apos;t sound diatonic, unless you started stipulating JI approximations for other combos of L &amp; s (like 2L = ~5/4, or 3L+s = ~3/2)...but you want to avoid that, right?</p><p>At least with the MOS-based approach I outlined above, relationship to JI basically becomes incidental.  If you define scales according to how different numbers of generators, modulo the period, relate to each other pitch-wise, you all you have to stipulate is how close you will allow the note produced by one set of generator/period coordinates to come to the note produced by another set of generator/period coordinates.  The whole thing can be done with cents values, really, and JI only enters the picture when we want to start evaluating the harmonic concordance of chords produced in various scales.</p><p>So on those lattices I posted?  You can forget everything I said about JI ratios.  The &quot;/&quot; just means &quot;4gen-2per&quot; and the &quot;\&quot; means &quot;-3gen+2per&quot;, and the &quot;---&quot; means &quot;1gen+0per&quot;.  Of course, you don&apos;t have to think this way to use lattices, and yes, you can certainly represent the diatonic scale on a lattice using major and minor 2nds.  The point is for it to be a map and to be helpful.  But I&apos;m pretty sure that, as far as what gives the diatonic scale its &quot;character&quot; is the fact that 1) it&apos;s generator is somewhere around a fifth and its period is an octave, 2) we can tell the difference between -1g+1p and 4g-2p, and between -3g+2p and 4g-2p (etc).</p><p>-Igs</p></div>
