To me, the quantum leap is not to<br/>&gt;devise a thousand new exciting new scales and ways to tune. It is, instead,<br/>&gt;to develop new musical structures and logic to use even just a new one in a<br/>&gt;meaningful way (for human beings) that does not repeat the same basic<br/>&gt;implementation of the ideas of classic harmony (tonic - dominant -<br/>&gt;subdominant, tension, dissonance and so forth.) Unfortunately, I haven&apos;t<br/>&gt;heard thus far any &quot;microtonal&quot; music which isn&apos;t conceptually a<br/>&gt;modification of those classic patterns, or random combinations (that doesn&apos;t<br/>&gt;make me happy; but of course I am just starting to explore.)</p><p>Blackwood&apos;s 15-tone etude, track 7 on his CD...</p><p><a href="http://www.cedillerecords.org/blackwood.html">http://www.cedillerecords.org/blackwood.html</a></p><p>&gt;The basic point is, I don&apos;t consider that something that sounds new (with<br/>&gt;some added effects) is a new creation. It may or may not. A new scale is not<br/>&gt;enough. A scale is a tool, not an end by itself. The challenge is to make<br/>&gt;sense out of it.</p><p>Can this really be improved by writing about it?  ...Doh!</p><p>&gt;Maybe the process of progressive appreciation of eastern music by a<br/>&gt;westerner can give us an idea of what it can take to embrace a new<br/>&gt;paradigm...</p><p>I doubt it.</p><p>Carl</p></div>
