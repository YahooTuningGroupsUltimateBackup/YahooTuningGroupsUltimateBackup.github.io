Look, I think most of you guys are very smart and insightful fellers, and there&apos;s a lot to be learned here. But, as before, i am a musician interested in tuning theory, and don&apos;t really care much about where we dot the i&apos;s...not to say technical points aren&apos;t important, cause they can be, but practical info about tunings and music is much more useful to me. I just had one student get a 24 tone guitar, and another guy got an oud....these guys may be the next Hendrix, you never know, and I want info that will help them be great artists, if possible. I believe non 12 tunings are the last frontier in western music, and that&apos;s why I do it, for the new and mysterious sounds that have not been heard yet...it&apos;s a hoot. Anyway, sorry to see the ruckus, hope it all works out...best...Hstick</p></div><h3>Dave Seidel &#x3C;dave@superluminal.com&#x3E;</h3><span>8/28/2004 10:01:56 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>As one of them lurkers...what he said.
