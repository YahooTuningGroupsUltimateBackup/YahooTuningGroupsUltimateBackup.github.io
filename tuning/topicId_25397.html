Everyone agrees as to the size of these intervals, whatever<br/>differences of opinion may obtain as to their most apt notation.</p><p>With neo-Gothic music, we have a wide range of tuning systems,<br/>often based on a 24-note gamut.</p><p>Thus with 72-tET, there are obvious advantages in picking _some_<br/>commonly agreed symbol for a specific size of interval, for example<br/>the symbols &quot;&gt;&quot; and &quot;&lt;&quot; to show a note raised or lowered by 1/6-tone,<br/>which serves among other things as the &quot;septimal comma&quot; in this<br/>system.</p><p>In contrast, a neo-Gothic &quot;septimal comma&quot; symbol used across<br/>different tuning systems may represent intervals of widely variable<br/>sizes which would not map consistently to a 72-tET notation.</p><p>In what I hope may be amusing presentation, I would like to illustrate<br/>this point.</p><p>Specifically, I focus on the following two neo-Gothic notational<br/>symbols:</p><p>   ^  shows a note raised  by a &quot;comma&quot; of ~15-35 cents, e.g. G^3<br/>   v  shows a note lowered by a &quot;comma&quot; of ~15-35 cents, e.g. Ebv4</p><p>In tunings with such &quot;comma-like&quot; intervals smaller than 35 cents or<br/>so, one purpose of these symbols is to identify &quot;near-equivalent&quot;<br/>pitches which might be taken as two versions of the same basic note.<br/>These small intervals typically define a &quot;septimal comma&quot; or<br/>equivalent in a given tuning system.</p><p>Thank you very much for your stimulating remarks, which made me<br/>consider a number of tunings and conclude that this symbol can indeed<br/>generally be equated with a &quot;septimal comma&quot; role.</p><p>However, structurally defined categories of intervals such as a<br/>&quot;septimal comma&quot; or a &quot;diatonic semitone&quot; may have widely varying<br/>sizes in different neo-Gothic tunings and temperaments.</p><p>For example, consider the interval E4-F4, a routine diatonic<br/>semitone. In Pythagorean intonation, this interval has a size of<br/>256:243 or ~90.22 cents; in 17-tET, it is 1/17 octave, or ~70.59<br/>cents; in 22-tET, it is 1/22 octave, or ~54.55 cents.</p><p>While the &quot;diatonic semitone&quot; category (e.g. E4-F4) is a very<br/>convenient one across a range of neo-Gothic tunings, this category<br/>does not consistently map to any one interval size in 72-tET or a<br/>similar system.</p><p>If we wished to transcribe pieces in these different tunings into<br/>72-tET, of course, then the solution would be in each case to<br/>substitute an appropriate 72-tET interval notation -- for example, a<br/>1/3-tone symbol to approximate the 70-cent semitone of 17-tET.</p><p>However, in approaching the neo-Gothic tuning systems themselves, I<br/>find it very convenient to have a generic &quot;diatonic semitone&quot; concept<br/>tied to a structural role rather than any specific interval size.</p><p>The generic &quot;septimal comma&quot; symbols &quot;^&quot; and &quot;v&quot; likewise serve to<br/>identify a role played by intervals which may not consistently map to<br/>a single 72-tET or similar category.</p><p>In illustrating this point, I would like to restrict the discussion to<br/>regular neo-Gothic tunings in the &quot;characteristic&quot; range between<br/>Pythagorean and 17-tET. While it is possible to come up with &quot;exotic&quot;<br/>systems proving or disproving almost any notational point, I would<br/>like to show how the size of the &quot;septimal comma&quot; varies within the<br/>range of the more typical systems.</p><p>As you point out, in a Pythagorean-based system with just intonation<br/>of &quot;7-flavor&quot; ratios (e.g. 9:7, 7:6, 12:7, 7:4, 8:7), the symbols &quot;^&quot;<br/>and &quot;v&quot; will indeed signify the septimal comma in its most proper<br/>sense, the interval of 64:63 (~27.26 cents). Here, for example, is the<br/>Sesquisexta tuning we were discussing, with two keyboards a pure 7:6<br/>apart (~266.87 cents), with intervals here shown in rounded cents:</p><p>       381       561               879      1083   1263<br/>      C#}/Ev   Eb}/Gbv           F#}/Av    G#}/Bv Bb}/Dbv<br/>C}/Ebv     D}/Fv      E}/Gv F}/Abv   G}/Bbv    A}/Cv   B}/Dv C}/Ebv<br/> 267        470        675   765      969       1173   1377  1467<br/>-------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>       114       294               612      816     996<br/>        C#       Eb                F#       G#      Bb<br/> C           D         E      F        G         A       B    C<br/> 0          204       408    498      702       906    1110  1200</p><p>Here each note on the upper manual is given in two notations, for<br/>example D}=Fv. The first notation tells us that we can find this note<br/>at the D key of the upper manual, while the second tells us that this<br/>note is a septimal comma lower than usual Pythagorean F.</p><p>For this tuning, the 64:63 septimal comma represented by &quot;v&quot; does<br/>nicely map to &quot;&lt;&quot; in 72-tET or the like.</p><p>Now let us consider the e-based temperament, which also features a set<br/>of 7-flavor intervals and a step playing a &quot;septimal comma&quot; role. Here<br/>the neo-Gothic asterisk symbol (*) shows a note raised by the diesis<br/>of ~55.28 cents, the distance between the keyboards:</p><p>       188       341              682      892     1046<br/>      C#}/Dv   Eb*/D#           F#*/Gv    G#*/Av  Bb*/A#<br/>C*/Dbv    D*/Ebv     E*/Fv F*/Gbv   G*/Abv    A*/Bbv  B*/Cv C*/Dbv<br/> 55        264        473   551      760        969    1178  1255<br/>-------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>       132      286               628      837      991<br/>        C#       Eb                F#       G#      Bb<br/> C           D         E      F        G         A       B    C<br/> 0          209       418    495      705       914    1123  1200</p><p>Here, again the sign &quot;v&quot; usefully indicates a note lowered by a<br/>&quot;septimal comma,&quot; which I would define in this loose sense as the<br/>difference between a regular major third and the best approximation of<br/>9:7, or between a regular minor third and the best approximation of<br/>7:6, etc.</p><p>For example, if we wish to build an approximation of 12:14:18:21 or<br/>14:18:21:24, our notation points to sonorities such as these:</p><p> Cv4 (=B*3)             F4<br/> A3                     Ebv3 (=D*4)<br/> Fv3 (=E*3)             C4<br/> D3                     Abv3 (=G*3)</p><p>~12:14:18:21          ~14:18:21:24</p><p>Here the minor third and seventh D3-Fv3 and D3-Cv4 in the first<br/>sonority are a &quot;septimal comma&quot; narrower than the regular intervals,<br/>and likewise the major third and sixth Abv3-C4 and Abv3-F4 a &quot;septimal<br/>comma&quot; wider.</p><p>Thus the symbol &quot;v&quot; serves the same musical role in either this tuning<br/>or the previous one.</p><p>However, in the e-based tuning, this interval is actually equal to a<br/>&quot;subdiesis&quot; of about 21.68 cents, the difference between the regular<br/>diatonic semitone at ~76.97 cents and the diesis at ~55.28 cents.</p><p>In 72-tET, we would more closely approximate this interval by a<br/>1/12-tone step rather than the 1/6-tone step of our previous example.</p><p>Similarly, let us consider the Pythagorean &quot;tricomma tuning&quot; where the<br/>two manuals are a &quot;tricomma&quot; apart, an interval equal to three<br/>Pythagorean commas, around 70.38 cents:</p><p>       184       365              682       886     1066<br/>     C#*3/Dv   Eb*3/Fb3v        F#*3/Gv  G#*3/Av3 Bb*3/Cb4v<br/> C*3/       D*3/      E*3/  F*3/     G*3/     A*3/      B*3/  C*4/<br/> Db3v       Ebv3      Fv    Gb3v     Abv3     Bbv3      C4v   Db4v<br/>  70        274       478   568      772       976      1180  1270<br/>----------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>       114       294              612      816     996<br/>       C#3       Eb3              F#3      G#3     Bb3<br/>  C3         D3        E3   F3        G3        A3       B3    C4<br/>  0         204       408   498      702       906      1110  1200</p><p>Again, the &quot;v&quot; symbol shows a note lowered by a &quot;septimal comma,&quot; and<br/>helps in identifying 7-flavor sonorities such as D3-Fv3-A3-Cv4<br/>(D3-E*3-A3-B*3) or Gb3v-Bb3-Db4v-Eb3 (F*3-Bb3-C*4-Eb4).</p><p>Here, the &quot;septimal comma&quot; is equal to around 19.84 cents, the<br/>difference between the 90.22-cent diatonic semitone and the 70.38-cent<br/>tricomma.</p><p>In 72-tET, this interval would most closely map to a step of<br/>1/12-tone, as in our last example.</p><p>Finally, let us consider a 24-note tuning based on 17-tET, with two<br/>12-note keyboards in 12-out-of-17-tET at the distance of an<br/>&quot;artificial diesis&quot; of around 55.11 cents, the difference between the<br/>usual 17-tET major second at ~211.76 cents and a pure 7:6 minor third:</p><p>       184       337              690      902      1043<br/>     C#*3/Dv   Eb*3/Fb3v        F#*3/Gv  G#*3/Av3 Bb*3/Cb4v<br/> C*3/       D*3/      E*3/  F*3/     G*3/     A*3/      B*3/  C*4/<br/> Db3v       Ebv3      Fv    Gb3v     Abv3     Bbv3      C4v   Db4v<br/>  55        267       479   568      772      973      1184  1255<br/>----------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>       141       282              635      847      988<br/>       C#3       Eb3              F#3      G#3      Bb3<br/>  C3         D3        E3   F3        G3        A3       B3    C4<br/>  0         212       424   494      706       917      1129  1200</p><p>Again, &quot;*&quot; represents a &quot;diesis&quot; and &quot;v&quot; a &quot;septimal comma&quot; -- with<br/>the latter interval here equal to the difference between the 17-tET<br/>diatonic semitone at ~70.59 cents, and our artificial diesis of ~55.11<br/>cents -- or about 15.48 cents.</p><p>In 72-tET terms, this &quot;v&quot; now represents an interval slightly smaller<br/>than 1/12-tone, and very closely approximated by such a step.</p><p>To conclude, the type of neo-Gothic notation I generally prefer<br/>permits writing a diatonic semitone as &quot;E4-F4,&quot; or a 7-flavor sonority<br/>approximating 7:9:12 as &quot;Abv3-C4-F4,&quot; across a range of tunings where<br/>semitones or &quot;septimal commas&quot; may vary considerably in size.</p><p>Of course, were we to transcribe pieces from these various tunings<br/>into 72-tET, then it would be necessary to map these intervals to<br/>appropriate 72-tET equivalents, using whatever notation might be most<br/>convenient, elegant, or widely understood (at least among the intended<br/>audience).</p><p>If we are discussing neo-Gothic tuning systems in their own terms,<br/>however, a &quot;nonstandard&quot; system may have the distinct advantage of<br/>avoiding certain inapplicable inferences about scale structure or<br/>interval sizes which a &quot;familiar&quot; set of symbols might invite.</p><p>For example, in the tuning with two &quot;12-of-17-tET&quot; keyboards at a<br/>distance of around 55 cents, the &quot;septimal comma&quot; defines the<br/>difference, between the regular 17-tET major third at ~423.53 cents,<br/>and the ~9:7 major third at ~439.01 cents.</p><p>Using a distinctive neo-Gothic notation may help to communicate that<br/>we have a scale structure quite different from 72-tET, or from 7-limit<br/>just intonation for that matter.</p><p>This last point, however, raises another issue: if neo-Gothic notation<br/>is to be distinctive, would it not be best to _avoid_ where possible<br/>symbols which might be familiar from a 72-tET or other &quot;standard&quot;<br/>notation?</p><p>Given the limited number of ASCII symbols available, this last<br/>question might be problematic; but, at least, there is the wise<br/>precaution of explaining, for example, that a neo-Gothic &quot;septimal<br/>comma&quot; might have a size of anywhere from around 15 cents to 33 cents<br/>depending on the tuning system.</p><p>Most appreciatively,</p><p>Margo Schulter<br/><a href="mailto:mschulter@value.net">mschulter@value.net</a></p></div><h3><a id=25401 href="#25401">ðŸ”—</a>jpehrson@rcn.com</h3><span>6/20/2001 7:40:35 PM</span><button style="float: right;
