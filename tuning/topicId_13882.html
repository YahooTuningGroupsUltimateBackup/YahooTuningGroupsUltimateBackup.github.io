I noticed that the two codes<br/>&gt;(BASIC and MATLAB) differ in the strengths of the partials, with the BASIC<br/>&gt;code using amplitudes that diminish by a factor of 0.88 each time and the<br/>&gt;MATLAB code using amplitudes of 1.0 for all the partials. And neither of the<br/>&gt;codes is structured the same way as the equations, although they are<br/>&gt;equivalent except for some scaling factors. My main question is, &quot;Where did<br/>&gt;the 0.88 factor come from?&quot; Is it meant to emulate some real musical<br/>&gt;instrument, or did you pick it because it generated reasonable curves and<br/>&gt;&quot;interesting&quot; sounds?</p><p>the two sets of codes are from different times, and I was doing<br/>different examples - one with all partials the same (maybe a prototypical<br/>organ with all stops pulled out) and the other a rough imitation of<br/>a string instrument in which the partials die away at some rate -<br/>and yes, I guess I picked this exact value because I liked the<br/>curve and the sound...</p><p>of course, the intent is that one can change the relative strengths<br/>and frequencies of the partials at will...</p></div>
