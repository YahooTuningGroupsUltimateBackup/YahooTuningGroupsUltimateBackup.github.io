Does anyone have any ideas on why minor triads, and<br/>&gt; &gt;minor keys, in functional harmony, have (subjectively speaking)<br/>&gt; &gt;a &apos;sad affect&apos;, compared to, say, the major triad, and major keys?<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;Yikes, Kelly<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I consider this somewhat of a mystery.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Two thought-provoking responses from Kraig and Jon.</p><p>Both of which I agree with. The &apos;sadness&apos; of minor triads and &apos;happiness&apos; of<br/>major triads seem to be reflected by the former having a lower-pitched note<br/>than the latter. That&apos;s my &apos;Occam&apos;s razor&apos; explanation. But I really think a<br/>lot of it is culturally-conditioned. You still can have really sad music in<br/>major keys and quite celebratory tunes in minor. A lot of it has to do with<br/>the animacy of the tempo and rhythm, and the overall timbre and whether it&apos;s<br/>bright or warm. And there are other moods that can be implied: peace, anger,<br/>fear...</p><p>In microtonal music, of course, there are different shades of &apos;majorness&apos;<br/>and &apos;minorness&apos;; in 31-tone (or 49 equal divisions of 3/1 which I prefer to<br/>use), the five thirds approximate the just intervals 7/6, 6/5, 11/9, 5/4 and<br/>9/7. The way I hear it, the distance of the third from 11/9 is proportional<br/>to the amount of &apos;tension&apos; in the chord. 6/5 is depressed in mood, but more<br/>relaxed than the subminor 7/6; the latter also gives me an impression of<br/>anger. 5/4 is happy and relaxed in mood, thus peaceful, and supermajor 9/7<br/>is ecstatic or manic, but I also get a feeling of fear and worry out of it,<br/>which I really get from augmented triads. The neutral third, 11/9, is very<br/>relaxed, but ambivalent and comes across to me as simultaneously major and<br/>minor, with a tension of its own, however, it&apos;s related to my relative lack<br/>of listening experience in quartertone music. Thus my recent obsession with<br/>Arab music; I&apos;m trying to cure that defect and get used to neutral<br/>intervals.</p><p>Which leads me to ask this: anybody develop a system of 31-tone jazz chords,<br/>or at least quartertone?</p><p>&gt; My guess has always been that this is somewhat cultural, but that<br/>&gt; there is also something physiological going on.  Namely, an effect<br/>&gt; that is characteristic of smooth chords with weak roots.  Chords<br/>&gt; like 4:5:6 are smooth and strongly rooted.  Chords like 10:12:15<br/>&gt; have the same intervals and are therefore nearly as smooth, yet are<br/>&gt; less strongly rooted.  To my ear, major triads clearly sound most<br/>&gt; solid when the 4 is voiced on the bottom.  Minor triads don&apos;t seem<br/>&gt; to care.  If true, this should hold, more or less, in the 7-limit.</p><p>I always thought that &apos;minorness&apos; implies utonality, while &apos;majorness&apos; is<br/>otonal. But that&apos;s really only true in 5-limit, since 7/6 is minor yet<br/>otonal. 10:12:15 is rooted in a common overtone (60); 4:5:6 in a common<br/>undertone (1), so I think both are definitely well-rooted, though in<br/>opposite directions. Something like 325:397:514 is definitely not<br/>well-rooted.</p><p>(Someone on this list said this is how Partch interpreted things.)</p></div><h3>Carl Lumma &#x3C;ekin@lumma.org&#x3E;</h3><span>6/23/2004 9:28:23 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>&gt;&gt; My guess has always been that this is somewhat cultural, but that<br/>&gt;&gt; there is also something physiological going on.

Can you fill in the blanks for me?--</p><p>Hi Paul.  Indeed, that&apos;s my main interest in music, is alternative<br/>functional harmonies (hearing them, writing them)...chord<br/>successsions which have the semblence of a standard progression, but<br/>without &apos;dominant&apos; propulsion, and where chord sonorority (and<br/>texture) is a functional element as important as melody and &apos;harmony&apos;<br/>were in earlier classical music; the holy grail would be finding a<br/>connection between how some of these non dominant but somehow<br/>propulsive progressions, and the chords they contain, tie into the<br/>harmonic series (and the physics of music), similar to the clear<br/>connections between &apos;the physics of music&apos; and scale formation and<br/>common practice harmony; (that&apos;s what Hindemeth did?   I can&apos;t listen<br/>to his music...)That&apos;s why I&apos;m so interested in chord environments<br/>which are free of the &apos;pushy&apos; dominant 7th chord (always wanting to<br/>resolve to one, or travel the circle of 5ths), but which have<br/>sonorous intervallic combinations.   That&apos;s why I find the<br/>disccussions at this group so interesting.</p><p>(My pet theory about non-dominant harmony is that, though you loose<br/>the triangular harmonic balance of classical compositions which are<br/>based on functional harmony (that being the balanceing tonal centers<br/>of I, IV, and V, and how they reflectively become each others<br/>dominant, etc), you gain some serenity or something like that in the<br/>shift to hearing intervals and chords just for their sonority and<br/>vibration! --and Number, too, if you&apos;re into that!)

I went through a first round of microtonal composing using a<br/>&gt;device Robin (my chess whiz brother) made which gave me four<br/>&gt;precisely tuned voices, for which I had a choice of square wave,<br/>&gt;square wave, square wav or square wav for the timbre.</p><p>I think you told me about that when we met.  I wouldn&apos;t knock<br/>the potential of even those few waveforms, either!</p><p>-Carl</p></div><h3>frizzerius &#x3C;lorenzo.frizzera@libero.it&#x3E;</h3><span>6/26/2004 4:40:23 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;wallyesterpaulrus&quot; &lt;paul@s...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt; --- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;frizzerius&quot;<br/>&lt;lorenzo.frizzera@l...&gt;<br/>&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt; &gt; Ciao.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; If you consider diatonic modes and you rearrange them through a<br/>&gt; &gt; circle of fifths you will have this list: lydian, ionian,<br/>&gt; &gt; mixolidian, dorian, eolian, phrigian and locrian. Each passage<br/>to a<br/>&gt; &gt; new mode produces the lowering of a note so that, at the end,<br/>you<br/>&gt; &gt; will have lowered any note except the tonic. If you do the same<br/>on<br/>&gt; &gt; this last note you will reach again a lydian mode but an half<br/>tone<br/>&gt; &gt; below.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; Considering the structure of these modes you will find that<br/>there<br/>&gt; is<br/>&gt; &gt; a specularity in the structure between lydian and locrian,<br/>ionian<br/>&gt; &gt; and phrigian, mixolidian and eolian; and that dorian mode is<br/>&gt; &gt; specular respect himself.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; By &quot;specularity&quot; do you mean &quot;mirrorring&quot;?</p><p>Yes.</p></div><h3>Gene Ward Smith &#x3C;gwsmith@svpal.org&#x3E;</h3><span>6/26/2004 5:29:02 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, Carl Lumma &lt;ekin@l...&gt; wrote:</p><p>&gt; &gt;&gt;Is there a url for this version?</p><p><a href="http://timidity.s11.xrea.com/index.en.html">http://timidity.s11.xrea.com/index.en.html</a></p><p>I used the most recent stable version listed there, a build from March<br/>29.
