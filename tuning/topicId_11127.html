The piece orbits around this microtone.</p><p>&quot;Bless Thy Mountains&quot; is for 2 pianos a quartertone apart.  Joshua Pierce and<br/>Dorothy Jonas have performed this work on AFMM concerts twice.  It is a<br/>hauntingly beautiful short work that is a great counterpart to the Ives<br/>quartertone-apart piano work.  It remains unrecorded, though we have plans.</p><p>Johnny Reinhard<br/>AFMM</p></div>
