I should have mailed that to you personally Paul, and not<br/>made a scene in front of the whole list!  I was incredibly tired and not<br/>thinking straight.</p><p>&gt;[Paul] are all your pitches really between 1/1 and 2/1?</p><p>Yes.  I had a second octave but it was incomplete.  Glasses would break,<br/>clerks would throw me out of glass stores, yard sales are unpredictable,<br/>nice glasses cost $10-30 a piece, etc.  It was the most high maintenance<br/>instrument I ever played!  I suppose it was worth it though, as I am buying<br/>glasses again for another one: the Bathtub model!</p><p>&gt; I will try these chords myself on the synth and get back to you.</p><p>Cool!  Enjoy!</p><p>&gt;Also, can you tell me what intervals, if any, you find dissonant on your<br/>glass organ?</p><p>Oh my.  As with most tuning systems, most random chords were dissonant.<br/>Clusters were dissonant, and I used to like clashing an otonal chord with a<br/>utonal chord that shared a common note.  A minimally beating dissonance as I<br/>remember.  It&apos;s been a while.</p><p>I just found a tape of my organ.  I&apos;m updating my site with pictures of the<br/>staggered and bent fret guitar necks in a few days, I&apos;ll try to get some<br/>glass organ sound samples up then too.</p><p>---<br/>Glen Peterson<br/>30 Elm Street North Andover, MA 01845<br/>(978) 975-1527<br/><a href="http://www.OrganicDesign.org/Glen/Instruments">http://www.OrganicDesign.org/Glen/Instruments</a></p></div>
