There were the &quot;university&quot;<br/>composers and there were the ONCE group outsiders... Bob Ashley<br/>(great<br/>guy!), Alvin Lucier, Gordon Mumma and George Cappiopo (my friend, but<br/>now mostly forgotten as a composer... alas).</p><p>The university guys and the ONCE guys all attended each others<br/>concerts.  They would applaud and BOO... lots of ferment.  It was an<br/>exciting time...</p><p>Part of the excitement was all the different opinions and activity.<br/>I think it&apos;s all great.  I like that kind of debate.  However, if<br/>people start to take it all personally, one can&apos;t do it anymore...</p><p>But without the &quot;foil&quot; of the university, the &quot;excitement&quot; would not<br/>have been the same...</p><p>Frankly, I don&apos;t find this post so OT, since it concerns electronic<br/>music studios... where possible &quot;xenharmonics&quot; could be made...</p><p>______ _____ _____ __<br/>Joseph Pehrson</p></div>
