By comparison, 12-tET has these thirds<br/>at 400 cents and 300 cents, so that it is &quot;not so accurate&quot; and has a<br/>rather &quot;busy&quot; quality by comparison with 5-limit just intonation, or<br/>for that matter an historical meantone temperament where major and<br/>minor thirds are at or quite close to pure.</p><p>However, in much of my music, usual or &quot;common&quot; ratios for major and<br/>minor thirds are around 14:11 (~417.51 cents) and 13:11 (~289.21<br/>cents) or 33:28 (~284.45 cents). In just intonation with pure 3:2<br/>fifths, 14:11 goes together with 33:28. In a mildly tempered system,<br/>however, with slightly wide fifths, it&apos;s not untypical to have major<br/>thirds very close to 14:11 and minor thirds closer to 13:11 than 33:28<br/>(with the same minor third serving to represent both ratios).</p><p>From my perspective, 12-tET tempers fifths by about the right amount,<br/>but in the less interesting direction. This gives me a different<br/>perspective on &quot;justness&quot; and &quot;temperament&quot; alike.</p><p>One difficulty of a discussion about &quot;just intonation,&quot; Julia, which<br/>your article might reflect, is the very different meanings and<br/>overtones (pun intended!) this term can carry for different people.<br/>To one person, it means using only a few &quot;simple&quot; and &quot;pure&quot; ratios in<br/>a &quot;concordant and natural&quot; music as a corrective to the &quot;dissonance&quot;<br/>practiced for the last century in European and related compositional<br/>traditions. To another, such as LaMonte Young, it means finding new<br/>and strikingly complex and different sonorities based on unfamiliar<br/>harmonics and synergistic effects requiring extremely accurate tuning.</p><p>We might come up with a crude typology like this, not to exhaust or<br/>adequately to represent the field, but indeed to show why some of the<br/>&quot;contradictions&quot; you discuss in your paper could actually represent<br/>differences of viewpoint as to what &quot;JI&quot; means, rather than<br/>inconsistencies between a limiting theory and a more creative<br/>practice:</p><p>                Conventional            Unconventional<br/>         __________________________________________________<br/>         |                        |                       |<br/>         |     Simple JI music    |   Complex JI (Young)  |<br/> Just    |                        |                       |<br/>         |          1.1           |          1.2          |<br/>         |________________________|_______________________|<br/>         |                        |                       |<br/>Tempered |    Tempered &quot;tonal&quot;    |  Tempered microtonal  |<br/>         |                        |                       |<br/>         |          2.1           |          2.2          |<br/>         |________________________|_______________________|</p><p>Here it&apos;s significant that the &quot;just/tempered&quot; variable is not<br/>necessarily the most important one in determining a composer&apos;s or<br/>listener&apos;s philosophy and orientation. A JI composition using new and<br/>unfamiliar ratios (category 1.2), and a composition likewise using<br/>some tempered microtonal system (category 2.2), could invite<br/>comparably favorable responses from those seeking novelty and<br/>innovation.</p><p>Further, I find that in my own musical explorations I sometimes<br/>combine aspects of 2.1 and 2.2. Consider, for example, the matter of<br/>the tempered 23:31:35:39 sonority in one of my favorite tuning<br/>systems, with fifths about 2.14 cents wide, and two 12-note chains of<br/>such fifths arranged about 58.68 cents apart to generate some pure 7:6<br/>intervals.</p><p>Anyway, 23:31:35:39 (in its pure form, about 0-516.76-726.87-914.21<br/>cents) has the interesting feature of including above the lowest voice<br/>both a 517-cent fourth (wide by 93:92 or about 18.72 cents) and a<br/>727-cent fifth (wide by 70:69 or about 24.91 cents). In conventional<br/>European terms, both intervals would be &quot;Wolves,&quot; dissonant fifths or<br/>fourths said to recall the howling of wolves.</p><p>In contrast to these somewhat exotic intervals, 39:23 is represented<br/>in the tuning I&apos;m applying here as a usual garden-variety major sixth<br/>at about 912.29 cents, which also represents the more routine ratio of<br/>22:13 (~910.79 cents). The difference in size between the theoretical<br/>ratios of 39:23 and 22:13 also forms an elegant superparticular ratio,<br/>507:506 (~3.42 cents).</p><p>The interesting thing about 23:31:35:39 from an &quot;isoharmonic&quot; point of<br/>view is that the successive terms of the ratio all have differences of<br/>either 4 or 8, which might lead to a certain synergistic kind of<br/>concord with sufficiently accurate tuning. Theorists such as Erv<br/>Wilson and George Secor have discussed this general kind of effect,<br/>although it remains an open question as to whether inaccuracies as<br/>great as a couple of cents might still such an effect in a tempered<br/>tuning.</p><p>What LaMonte Young has done is to use _extremely_ accurate tuning<br/>technologies to create new musical architectures with very high<br/>harmonic ratios. This is indeed innovative music, in practice and<br/>theory, based on the harmonic series as an organizing factor.</p><p>Julia, your article raises for me an interesting question: to what<br/>degree does the effect of the extended JI music you like draw<br/>specifically on complex &quot;justness&quot; (precisely tuned integer ratios, or<br/>relations between partials), and to what degree mainly on the<br/>refreshing novelty of the intervals and melodic steps, &quot;just&quot; or<br/>otherwise?</p><p>Most appreciatively,</p><p>Margo Schulter<br/><a href="mailto:mschulter@value.net">mschulter@value.net</a></p></div><h3>jwerntz2002 &#x3C;juliawerntz@attbi.com&#x3E;</h3><span>11/23/2002 8:19:43 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Hi Margo.</p><p>Thanks for your thoughts and comments, and please forgive me for taking this<br/>long to reply.</p><p>--- In tuning@y..., &quot;M.

When stripped down to this level, I would seem to have my basic<br/>impetus more-or-less in common with JI-ers who fall in this second category, even<br/>if the music and aesthetic is so very different, as well as the logic and means with<br/>which we choose  our pitches.</p><p>&gt; We might come up with a crude typology like this, not to exhaust or<br/>&gt; adequately to represent the field, but indeed to show why some of the<br/>&gt; &quot;contradictions&quot; you discuss in your paper could actually represent<br/>&gt; differences of viewpoint as to what &quot;JI&quot; means, rather than<br/>&gt; inconsistencies between a limiting theory and a more creative<br/>&gt; practice:<br/>&gt;</p><p>Certainly, especially in the context of this list, I&apos;m sure that the differing viewpoints<br/>about what JI means are the source of many stimulating discussions for members,<br/>and represent a nice plurality. From my point of view, though, there still seem to<br/>be some inconsistencies within the philosophical positions of certain practitioners<br/>and also within the basic theoretical premise - when that basic premise is a<br/>mandate of acoustical, harmonic &quot;correctness.&quot; (Which at this point is a topic I<br/>have probably beaten into the ground.)</p><p>&gt;<br/>&gt;                 Conventional            Unconventional<br/>&gt;          __________________________________________________<br/>&gt;          |                        |                       |<br/>&gt;          |     Simple JI music    |   Complex JI (Young)  |<br/>&gt;  Just    |                        |                       |<br/>&gt;          |          1.1           |          1.2          |<br/>&gt;          |________________________|_______________________|<br/>&gt;          |                        |                       |<br/>&gt; Tempered |    Tempered &quot;tonal&quot;    |  Tempered microtonal  |<br/>&gt;          |                        |                       |<br/>&gt;          |          2.1           |          2.2          |<br/>&gt;          |________________________|_______________________|<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Here it&apos;s significant that the &quot;just/tempered&quot; variable is not<br/>&gt; necessarily the most important one in determining a composer&apos;s or<br/>&gt; listener&apos;s philosophy and orientation.

Of course, by now you probably know my interpretation of the JI<br/>pieces *I* like. I know that, for example, I enjoy Ezra Sims&apos; melodies not because<br/>they contain more accurate harmonies than 12-note ET music does (which I don&apos;t<br/>believe they do), but because Ezra chooses relationships I perceive as refreshing,<br/>and, even more importantly, because of the expressive qualities of his melodies,<br/>the artistry of his writing with these new intervals.</p><p>Thanks again, Margo.</p><p>-Julia</p></div>
