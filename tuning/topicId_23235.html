Paul Erlich, did not come and subscribe to the Practical<br/>Microtonality Group, to join in and participate in Microtonal Music<br/>making, and the sharing process that we have started there.</p><p>B.    Paul Erlich, subscribed to the Practical Microtonality Group,<br/>and feeling that some of the things that had been said there were<br/>about him, when *in factual truth* his name was never mentioned in<br/>any post there; proceeded to contact members privately, to voice his<br/>disapproval and ask for explanations from them.</p><p>This is the truth.</p><p>I would like to ask a number of you, to step into my position for a<br/>second, and let me give you a hypothetical situation to contemplate:</p><p>Imagine if you were to undertake something such as I, and start a<br/>group of the nature, which I have openly revealed from the start in<br/>this forum - and I (although the thought could never occur to me), or<br/>someone, were to come to your group, without any real intention to<br/>join in the spirit and purpose there, and read things there *where<br/>their name was never mentioned* - then derive some feeling that these<br/>things were being said about them, and go on to use the email<br/>addresses of the members there to, contact them privately for<br/>explanations about what they said in your new forum, which even at<br/>the greatest stretch, were nothing more than metaphorical in nature.</p><p>How would you interpret this?</p><p>How would you react to this? Especially if you had been using the<br/>word &quot;friend&quot; to describe this person?</p><p>How would this make you feel?</p><p>Perhaps to answer this question properly, you would indeed have to be<br/>me, and have the feeling that at every single minute step of the way,<br/>that you had been open and forthcoming and honest about forming this<br/>new community, along with carefully outlining its intent and purpose.</p><p>My reaction, and my feeling was that it was done for no good purpose.<br/>But as I hope all of you know, where I may have made a mistake or<br/>perhaps acted too quickly, I also know how to humbly say when I was<br/>wrong.</p><p>Please try to understand me on this. And understand how awkward it is<br/>to have to bring this into the public light. But I did what I thought<br/>was right. I did what I thought was right, because I felt that as<br/>this thing was just getting the ground under its feet, it was<br/>important to keep these kinds of hidden activities in check for the<br/>benefit all of the members who have joined in a real spirit of<br/>sincerity, and to actually partake in the purpose there.</p><p>If I did misunderstand, and if I did act too quickly, then I<br/>apologize to all, because at the bottom of everything - I am a flawed<br/>human being. I wish it were possible to act in a perfect manner in<br/>all I do, but this is not always possible, as evidenced by this<br/>writing. Perhaps some will relate when I say, that sometimes one must<br/>act on principle - and to judge what another feels they must do in<br/>acting from this place in themselves, is to fall short of standing in<br/>their shoes, and thus gaining their unique perspective on acting in<br/>the moment.</p><p>With this message, I will remove myself from this forum for a while,<br/>perhaps permanently. The simple things that I have wished to become<br/>involved in, and put my energy into, involve a feeling of open<br/>sharing, and a sense of community and purpose, where all participants<br/>are on the same level. This is not to say that this is not<br/>flourishing here for many, but as I look over the past few days of<br/>what has been said here, I must further admit my serious skepticism<br/>about if it really does include me.</p><p>Finally, let me say that I hold no hard feelings toward anyone here,<br/>and wish you all well. Perhaps I will return to share sometime in the<br/>future, but right now, I feel it best to remove my influence here for<br/>all of those who may prefer it this way.</p><p>Kindest Blessings,</p><p>Jacky Ligon</p></div><h3><a id=23240 href="#23240">ðŸ”—</a>Kees van Prooijen &#x3C;kees@dnai.com&#x3E;</h3><span>5/19/2001 5:08:37 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>I&apos;m out of there!<br/>Joining in the spirit??..........Brrrrrr</p><p>Dante, until now I was only thinking, not saying.
