Looks<br/>like your open tuning is 7-limit, though, so if you&apos;re<br/>matching up with some kind of hexany, I&apos;m guessing it&apos;s a<br/>7-limit one.</p><p>So... a &quot;stellated hexany&quot; is a hexany with each of the<br/>eight triads completed to a tetrad.  In the typical<br/>7-limit case it has 14 notes (6 original notes plus one<br/>note to complete each of the 8 triads = 14).</p><p>Is this making any sense?</p><p>One thing you might try, since guitars have six strings,<br/>is an open tuning based on a hexany.  I wonder what it<br/>would lead to...  Here&apos;s one to try if you like:</p><p>35/32<br/>5/4<br/>21/16<br/>3/2<br/>7/4<br/>15/8</p><p>-Carl</p></div><h3><a id=55707 href="#55707">ðŸ”—</a>Carl Lumma &#x3C;ekin@lumma.org&#x3E;</h3><span>8/19/2004 12:05:43 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>I wrote...</p><p>&gt;One thing you might try, since guitars have six strings,<br/>&gt;is an open tuning based on a hexany.
