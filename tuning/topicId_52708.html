And, as tuning systems are<br/>usually constructed so as to repeat themselves at intervals of<br/>approximately 2:1 (the octave), the ~2:1 generator functions as the<br/>period of the system. Musical cultures whose scales repeat at the<br/>~2:1 treat pitches separated by ~2:1 as &quot;equivalent&quot;, typically<br/>giving them the same name. Then ~3:1, or equivalently 3:2 (the fifth)<br/>or 3:4 (the fourth) can be regarded simply as the generator. In this<br/>guise, meantone temperament, though 2-dimensional, has been referred<br/>to as a &quot;linear temperament&quot; by Erv Wilson and others.</p><p>It&apos;s not always the case, though, that a 2-dimensional temperament<br/>can be generated by a pair of intervals such that one of them is<br/>~2:1. [[[[[[[[[[[[[[[examples, with technical explanations,<br/>deleted]]]]]]]]]]]]]]] Such fractions-of-octave periods, though, are<br/>clearly not psychoacoustic or cultural intervals of equivalence. So<br/>the applicability of the term &quot;linear temperament&quot; to all 2-<br/>dimensional temperaments is debatable.</p><p>Once the period and generator of a 2-dimensional temperament are<br/>identified, scales can be created in a straightforward way. Starting<br/>with one note per period, the generator is used to add more and more<br/>pitches to the scale. At certain points in this process, the scale<br/>has only two different step sizes. At these points, traversing any<br/>given number of consecutive steps in the scale can result in at most<br/>two specific sizes of interval, regardless of where one begins in the<br/>scale. The number of sizes will be exactly two except where the<br/>interval is the period or a multiple thereof (in which case there&apos;s<br/>only one size). In cases where the period is an octave, these points<br/>have been referred to as Moments-Of-Symmetry, or MOS scales, by Erv<br/>Wilson and others. They&apos;ve also been called Myhill scales. A more<br/>general term that includes the cases where the octave is a multiple<br/>number of periods is Distributionally Even scale (DES).</p><p>Pitches in scales that repeat every (tempered) octave can be grouped<br/>together into &quot;equivalence classes&quot;. We&apos;ll use the term &quot;pitch class&quot;<br/>to indicate a pitch along with all its (tempered) octave-<br/>transpositions. Using this idea, we can concisely display DESs by<br/>employing a type of diagram called a &quot;horagram&quot; by Erv Wilson. He<br/>uses them to depict MOS scales but I will take the liberty of<br/>applying the term to this more general case. Take a look now at the<br/>horagrams which comprise the bulk of this paper. Let&apos;s use the TOP<br/>meantone horagram as an example. The horagram depicts pitch classes<br/>as rays, and intervals as angles, with a (tempered) octave<br/>represented, like an hour on a clock, as a full circle. The diagram<br/>begins with one pitch class per period shown as rays emanating from<br/>the center of the diagram. In the TOP meantone case, this is a single<br/>vertical ray, representing 0 cents, the tempered octave of 1201.7<br/>cents (explicitly indicated), and all integer multiples thereof. Then<br/>the process of repeatedly applying the generator to add more pitch<br/>classes occurs. By convention, the smallest possible interval is<br/>chosen to represent the generator Â– in this case, the tempered fourth<br/>of 504.13 cents. So the second pitch obtained within the frame of an<br/>octave is shown as 504.13 cents. Unlike Wilson, in whose horagrams<br/>the generator is always applied in the same direction, I apply the<br/>generator alternately upward from one end of the chain(s) and<br/>downward from the other. So the third pitch obtained within the<br/>octave is obtained by applying the generator downward from the first<br/>pitch class: 1201.7 - 504.13 = 697.57 cents. The fourth pitch class<br/>is obtained by applying the generator upward from the second pitch<br/>class: 504.13 + 504.13 = 1008.26 cents. And the fifth pitch class is<br/>obtained by applying the generator downward from the third pitch<br/>class: 697.57 - 504.13 = 193.44 cents. Each time a DES is formed, a<br/>concentric ring is drawn, the number of notes per octave in the DES<br/>is written in the ring near the top, and each step is labeled with<br/>its size in cents. The process continues with the rays emanating from<br/>the outside of the ring. Successive rings get drawn further and<br/>further from the center.</p><p>TOP meantone shows 5- and 7-note rings, corresponding to the familiar<br/>pentatonic and diatonic scales. If the 0/1201.7-cent pitch class is<br/>assigned to the note D, the rest of the 7-note ring will correspond<br/>to the notes E, F, G, A, B, and C. A chain of 7 generators produces<br/>the small interval of 76.19 cents, which first shows itself in the 12-<br/>note (&quot;chromatic&quot;) ring. This interval is also the difference between<br/>the two step sizes in the 7-note ring. Raising a note by this<br/>interval appends a &quot;sharp&quot; (#) to its name, while a like lowering<br/>appends a &quot;flat&quot; (b&#x19;-). With these symbols, any meantone pitch class<br/>can be assigned a unique name. A similar notation scheme can be<br/>devised for any 2-dimensional temperament. The reader may find it<br/>useful or enjoyable to concoct such schemes using the horagrams here<br/>provided.</p></div><h3><a id=53287 href="#53287">ðŸ”—</a>kraig grady &#x3C;kraiggrady@anaphoria.com&#x3E;</h3><span>4/30/2004 8:44:42 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>wallyesterpaulrus wrote:</p><p>&gt; In cases where the period is an octave, these points<br/>&gt; have been referred to as Moments-Of-Symmetry, or MOS scales, by Erv<br/>&gt; Wilson and others.</p><p>I might be reading this wrong and the context may have caused you to<br/>explain it in this way  by Erv &apos;s is Horagrams are not tied to the octives<br/>at all.</p><p>&gt; They&apos;ve also been called Myhill scales.

Several years<br/>&gt; before that, you said it would, so I made extra sure you were sure<br/>&gt; the last time . . . or so I thought . . .<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; I do not see what is gained by such a process compared to the<br/>&gt; original<br/>&gt; &gt; method of superimposing the same interval. you end up with the same<br/>&gt; scales<br/>&gt; &gt; except in a different mode. Isn&apos;t this like changing the Major<br/>&gt; scale to a<br/>&gt; &gt; dorian?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; It would be like changing Lydian or Locrian to Dorian, yes. The<br/>&gt; original method gives Lydian or Locrian; my method above gives<br/>&gt; Dorian. In general, if you&apos;re looking for the tempered approximation<br/>&gt; of a particular consonant interval, there&apos;s almost a 50% chance that<br/>&gt; you&apos;ll never encounter it in relation to the root if you use the<br/>&gt; original method. Lydian has no perfect fourth or minor third above<br/>&gt; the root, Locrian no perfect fifth or major sixth above the root, and<br/>&gt; this would remain the case no matter how far out one went in the<br/>&gt; horagram. If one generates alternately up and down from the root, one<br/>&gt; eventually encounters every interval in relation to the root.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; That&apos;s how the horagrams that Jacob was looking at, and that I sent<br/>&gt; you (since you were not here at the time), were produced. But now I&apos;m<br/>&gt; making &apos;floragrams&apos;, in which the generators do proceed in only one<br/>&gt; direction from the root (and its period-transpositions, if any).

The mode issue is indeed confusing. However, it<br/>is much easier for me to see what&apos;s going on in the generation of the scale if the<br/>symmetry is centered around 12 o&apos;clock, which happens some of the time when you<br/>go in both directions.</p><p>Meanwhile I&apos;m having issues generating MOSes in (command-line) Scala...I want to be<br/>able to just put in a generating interval and see which ones are possible, and then<br/>choose one.
