For otonalities it&apos;s not that bad,it even reinforces the fundamental<br/>and gives it a richer sound, but for utonalities they are very dissonant and<br/>unwanted. I&apos;ve tried turning some pitches out of phase and detuning them<br/>slightly and even turning off one speaker but nothing seems to work. Has<br/>anyone else had this same problem or does anyone else know of a soulution?</p><p>Stay Tuned,<br/>    Keenan P</p></div><h3><a id=9791 href="#9791">ðŸ”—</a>John Thaden &#x3C;jjthaden@flash.net&#x3E;</h3><span>4/25/2000 10:02:04 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>If with a waveform generator your favorite tuning suffers dissonant<br/>combination tones (difference tones?), then isn&apos;t it likely to suffer them<br/>also to some extent through many microphone/PA combinations? Or even<br/>acoustically?  With my instrument (diatonic harmonica), entire tuning<br/>schemes are devoted to the achievement of consonant, supportive difference<br/>tones.</p><p>John Thaden</p><p>At 09:15 PM 4/24/2000 -0400, Keenan P wrote:<br/>&gt;I have been using Addsyn32, an additive synthesis waveform generator, to<br/>&gt;play JI chords, and it&apos;s been very useful except for one thing: combination<br/>&gt;tones.
