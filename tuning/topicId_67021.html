Your differing responses<br/>seem to reflect what others experience, too.<br/>I (na&iuml;vely, I suppose) had expected members of<br/>this list to share somewhat better than average<br/>hearing (unless damaged by too much loud rock,<br/>or other &quot;industrial&quot; deafness).</p><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;Ozan Yarman&quot; &lt;ozanyarman@...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I hear it extremely loud and clear, not the &quot;like this&quot;<br/>&gt; section narrated by Melissa Block (there is nothing to<br/>&gt; hear there other than static!), but the teen buzz here:<br/>&gt; <a href="http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=5483203">http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=5483203</a></p><p>Lots of good feedback (heh) there.  One comment runs:<br/>&quot;The sound I hear is about the upper middle range of the piano,<br/>certainly not a challenge for most peoples&apos; ears. It&apos;s just about<br/>the frequency of the tone used in the U.S. to announce emergency<br/>broadcast system tests. I think what I&apos;m hearing is an alias, where,<br/>much like an old-fashioned British bobby&apos;s whistle, two high notes<br/>interact to form a third, lower one. In this case, it&apos;s probably an<br/>interaction between the tone itseslf and the sampling frequency used<br/>to encode the MP3. I hope some physics-savvy listener will post some<br/>information about the Nyquist frequency and how it relates to<br/>problems with digital sound recording...&quot;.</p><p>So, is it a difference tone I&apos;m hearing?<br/>I&apos;ll be 57 in September.  It strikes me<br/>that I&apos;m hearing something only a little<br/>higher than 10.5 kHz. To be precise, it<br/>seems to be a single pitch an octave higher<br/>than a note between E8 and F8 (the highest<br/>E and F) on the piano.  That would make it<br/>between 10560 and ~11660 Hz, right?  That&apos;s<br/>&quot;off the scale&quot; (of the piano keyboard).</p><p>Yet Carl says it&apos;s around 16 kHz, which<br/>would put it a couple of tones above A9,<br/>very close to the top C on the piano.<br/>Did you check the sound with a scope, Carl?</p><p>&gt; or here:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; <a href="http://www.freemosquitoringtone.com/">http://www.freemosquitoringtone.com/</a></p><p>I&apos;ve downloaded and played both files.<br/>The original one is 10 s long, the second<br/>is 8 s long; apart from that, they sound<br/>very similar to me.  Not particularly loud,<br/>but not so faint I need to turn up the<br/>(PC desktop 3D speaker) volume from my<br/>normal moderately low setting.  BTW, I can<br/>hear these sounds perfectly well even<br/>during a bout of tinnitus, which I get<br/>every time I get a cold (and I get lots of<br/>those ;-( ...)</p><p>&gt; And I must say I find it utterly irritating.</p><p>Well, TV ultrasonics are, IME, very *much*<br/>worse than this, and so is the kind of feedback<br/>you get from a pub band.

One comment runs:<br/>&quot;The sound I hear is about the upper middle range of the piano,<br/>certainly not a challenge for most peoples&apos; ears. It&apos;s just about<br/>the frequency of the tone used in the U.S. to announce emergency<br/>broadcast system tests. I think what I&apos;m hearing is an alias, where,<br/>much like an old-fashioned British bobby&apos;s whistle, two high notes<br/>interact to form a third, lower one. In this case, it&apos;s probably an<br/>interaction between the tone itseslf and the sampling frequency used<br/>to encode the MP3. I hope some physics-savvy listener will post some<br/>information about the Nyquist frequency and how it relates to<br/>problems with digital sound recording...&quot;.</p><p>So, is it a difference tone I&apos;m hearing?<br/>I&apos;ll be 57 in September.  It strikes me<br/>that I&apos;m hearing something only a little<br/>higher than 10.5 kHz. To be precise, it<br/>seems to be a single pitch an octave higher<br/>than a note between E8 and F8 (the highest<br/>E and F) on the piano.  That would make it<br/>between 10560 and ~11660 Hz, right?  That&apos;s<br/>&quot;off the scale&quot; (of the piano keyboard).</p><p>Yet Carl says it&apos;s around 16 kHz, which<br/>would put it a couple of tones above A9,<br/>very close to the top C on the piano.<br/>Did you check the sound with a scope, Carl?</p><p>&gt; or here:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; <a href="http://www.freemosquitoringtone.com/">http://www.freemosquitoringtone.com/</a></p><p>I&apos;ve downloaded and played both files.<br/>The original one is 10 s long, the second<br/>is 8 s long; apart from that, they sound<br/>very similar to me.

There is CLEARLY to me a tone<br/>during the broadcast &quot;like this&quot; portion, and it is somewhere<br/>just under 17K.</p><p>Testing my hearing, 17K just barely seems like a tone.  I can<br/>hear just past 19K in the sense that I can play around 19, turn<br/>the volume up really high and sesne this squealling annoying<br/>high frequency that doesn&apos;t really seem like a tone, but I definitely<br/>hear this &quot;ringing&quot; in my ears, and I can sweep the volume up and<br/>down and it correllates exactly.  By 20K I hear nothing no matter<br/>what, except that if I really crank it I start to hear difference tones<br/>or other noises that are clearly not the 20K.</p><p>Anyway, I don&apos;t know what broadcast issues there are, and their<br/>might also be noise, but like I said, I heard a tone in the broadcast<br/>link.</p><p>I&apos;ve always been sensitive to TV ultrasonics too, now that you<br/>mention it.  But I haven&apos;t been around TVs much lately to know<br/>if I still am.  I know I&apos;m not as sensitive as I once was.</p><p>Oh and as for sampling at 44/48/96 etc.  it&apos;s more complicated<br/>than that.  Yahya I think commented.  Just a quick briefing:  44<br/>sampling only allows frequencies up to 22, because one wave<br/>needs a low point and high point both in order to be captured.<br/>Also, due to imperfections in actual recording hardware, 44<br/>systems are never set to record all the way to 22 because they<br/>start to get glitches around the cutoff point, so they use a low<br/>pass filter.  For cheap systems, that could be as low as 17 or 18!<br/>If you record at 96, the low pass filter could be at 30 or higher<br/>in a cheap system, thus no risk of losing frequencies around 20.<br/>And the further point is:  If an orchestra in a real concert produces<br/>tones at 40K and 44K, there will be very small difference tones at<br/>4K!  That is very subtle now, but we certainly hear that stuff.  While<br/>it won&apos;t be exactly the same, a recording that only picks up 20K<br/>and under will successfully record the 4K difference tone.  Yay!<br/>BUT... if you record two violin parts separately in a studio<br/>overdubbing, but cut out anything over 20K, then you will<br/>lose the 40K region from each recording, and they together<br/>will not make the difference tone.  So recording for overdubbing<br/>at 96K is the best bet for capturing all the possible interactions<br/>of the various sounds, including audible difference tones of<br/>inaudible frequencies.</p><p>But then, with obviously imperfect listening systems,<br/>background noise, and damaged hearing, as we&apos;ve all seen<br/>in this thread... well... we&apos;re getting pretty picky to bother<br/>caring about all this subtlety.</p><p>-Aaron</p></div><h3><a id=67053 href="#67053">ðŸ”—</a>yahya_melb &#x3C;yahya@melbpc.org.au&#x3E;</h3><span>6/25/2006 5:47:01 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Hi Oz,</p><p>Thanks for an interesting and pertinent link.</p><p>I downloaded the samples at 10 to 25 kHz from the<br/>website you linked to.

I can hear *something*<br/>&gt; in each of them!

I wasted<br/>&gt; Saturday morning playing with Csound, and despite<br/>&gt; the completely beginner-unfriendly nature of the<br/>&gt; documentation (why is it that so few software<br/>&gt; developers are ever *teachers*?), have managed to<br/>&gt; begin to get some sounds out of it.
