We also have a<br/>strictly 5-limit<br/>comma, 2 (25/27)^9 = .86 cents, and an 11-limit comma, smallest of all,<br/>8 (49/55)^18 = .36 cents. Nine nominals suffice for 7-limit music, which<br/>means they can be noted nicely on a usual staff; a half-step symbol<br/>extends this to 18 nominals, which works for 11-limit &quot;EJI&quot;--where by EJI<br/>I mean effectively just, but not strictly rational intonation. If anyone<br/>objects to that description, note that this system is more accurate than<br/>putting cents values in as Johnny does.</p><p>Limitations of this system are that people would need to learn it, and<br/>that it stops at the 11-limit and does not work as it stands for<br/>temperaments. On the plus side, it is very simple, very accurate and<br/>needs no special plugins or software to notate.</p></div>
