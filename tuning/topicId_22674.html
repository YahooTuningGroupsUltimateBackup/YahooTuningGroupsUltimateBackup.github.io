I&apos;ve thought about it for a couple of days.  I subscribe to a few lists, and each of<br/>them has one or two &quot;schmucks,&quot; or &quot;muggles,&quot; if you will.  So happens the day after you posted that,<br/>one of the Bible teachers I hear on the radio from time to time mentioned something about people &quot;who<br/>were born in the objective case.&quot;  I thought that was an apt way to put it.  And I don&apos;t think it&apos;s<br/>really a bad thing.  If it weren&apos;t for people like you, the rest of us would wander off on<br/>unproductive rabbit trails far more often.  You&apos;re sort of like human guardrails keeping the rest of<br/>us from careening off into the ditches of sloppy thinking.  (Well, some people insist on being stuck<br/>there, but that&apos;s not your fault.)  It was kind of weird when you were gone from the TL for a while.<br/>Even though Graham and Dave K. were still there, I had this uneasy sense that we were like sheep<br/>without a shepherd.  Glad to have you back.</p><p>--<br/>David J.
