One would have to look at larger sets.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Yes, I thought about something similar, too. What is clear is that it&apos;s never possible to have a PERMOS with 2 intervals on the generator level, since the generator level of an MOS always has the form 1M(n-1)m, or (n-1)M1m. I&apos;d also assume that interval levels of the form xMym are much more &quot;fruitful&quot; / uncomplicated if x and y are closer together (e.g. 8M9m, as opposed to 2M15m).<br/>&gt;<br/>This is also true of the Marwa Permutations, One can do them on any level except  the level of the generator unless it has been alerted as in my earlier example but i had hope to have shown that changing  one of the other levels can result in getting a layer with 3 sizes to play with on the generator one. That one can branch off of any of the leyer in general is an exciting compositional point of departure one can return to or work toward as opposed to away from. If samples of all the possible directions are represented, it seems that withholding the parent scale till the end might potentially be quite dramatic<br/>I don&apos;t follow the temperament application because fundamentally i am working towards an opposite goal. To have as many different sizes intervals and commas as possible. Still one likes to have something that holds together as a self propelling structure which MOS and ETs can do structurally. How far one can go will always be a fuzzy border, but near the border seems one of the more interesting places.</p></div><h3><a id=105491 href="#105491">ðŸ”—</a>Brofessor &#x3C;kraiggrady@...&#x3E;</h3><span>12/3/2012 11:50:02 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p><a href="http://anaphoria.com/centaur.html">http://anaphoria.com/centaur.html</a><br/> this page has been updated. mainly to replace the 17 tone scale with a much better one. one might have to reload to see all the diagrams.</p></div><h3><a id=105513 href="#105513">ðŸ”—</a>gedankenwelt94 &#x3C;gedankenwelt94@...&#x3E;</h3><span>12/4/2012 4:54:46 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Ok, I think I figured it out by now...</p><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;gedankenwelt94&quot; &lt;gedankenwelt94@...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt; This way it works, but is it really alright to associate 28/27 (the smallest step) with L,s,s, and 21/20 (which is larger) with s,s,s?

These too can each be taken in all the division one want with<br/>this entire page being possible from where we started.  These cover the<br/>parent Ls small patterns you use in your example with just the 4 i<br/>mentioned.</p><p>Another unrelated thought is that since Viggo Bruns Algorithm does not<br/>designate which order the subsequent divisions are placed, one has the<br/>opportunity there to start with a Permos by how one places it and to<br/>construct each layer likewise. this makes the step of finding the MOS<br/>first and then changing it an unnecessary step.</p></div>
