This is always more flexible than recorded or<br/>computer-performed demo, and may even be better than pitch tracking with<br/>visual feedback (keyboard is audio feedback).  Keep in mind pitch tracking<br/>doesn&apos;t work on multiple notes at once, and there&apos;s no way to isolate each<br/>part of a good ensemble to individual tracks (maybe clever close micing<br/>under certain circumstances), since they need to hear each other during<br/>performance.  Michael Zarky has a very good pitch tracking program.

But those are bytes, not bits.</p><p>Yes, somebody else pointed out to me that my message made it sound like<br/>your modem was connected at 42K *bytes* per second.

I didn&apos;t mean this,<br/>&gt; and my calculation is correct.</p><p>   I don&apos;t know if this is universally adhered to, but I&apos;ve generally seen a<br/>capital B to mean bytes, and a lower-case b to mean bits.  So, for example<br/>42Kbps would mean 42K bits per second, whereas a 100MB Zip disk holds 100M<br/>bytes.</p></div><h3><a id=239 href="#239">ðŸ”—</a>Greg Schiemer &#x3C;gregs@xxxx.xxxx.xxx.xxx&#x3E;</h3><span>1/9/1999 3:17:36 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>&gt;&gt;It would be nice to have an objective way of demonstrating to singers, or<br/>&gt;&gt;players of fretless instruments that they have succeeded in achieving a<br/>&gt;&gt;particular type of intonation.</p><p>&gt;All you need is a keyboard.
