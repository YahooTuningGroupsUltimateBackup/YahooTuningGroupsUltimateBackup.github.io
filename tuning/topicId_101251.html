The infinite ratios of the n-prime-limit for any n &gt;= 3 form what&apos;s called a &quot;dense set&quot;, which means you can approximate any other interval arbitrarily accurately.

The key point is that you only need *two* 3/2s to get 9/4 *exactly* right, whereas if you were trying to approximate some new prime, say 5, you can get as close as you want, *but* in order to get closer and closer you have to stack more and more 3/2s until your scale has a ridiculous number of notes in it.</p><p>In other words having 3s in your system guarantees you have 9s of low &quot;complexity&quot;, where &quot;complexity&quot; basically means the number of notes you have to put in your scale to get a certain interval - the complexity of 9 is just twice the complexity of 3. You can also get arbitrarily accurate 5s or any higher prime, but for a new prime there is always a trade-off between accuracy and complexity.</p><p>For odd numbers that are the product of lower primes (9, 15, 21, 25...), you automatically get them exactly right with a finite complexity, so there is no trade-off.</p><p>Keenan</p></div><h3><a id=101260 href="#101260">ðŸ”—</a>Michael &#x3C;djtrancendance@...&#x3E;</h3><span>8/15/2011 3:00:19 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Me&gt;&quot;Now...why is prime limit more important?&quot;</p><p>Keenan&gt;&quot;Because if you already have a 3-limit system where you can stack<br/>intervals on top of each other and remain in the system, then you can<br/>easily get 9/4 just by stacking two 3/2 on top of each other.

Why is<br/>&gt; odd-limit most important?</p><p>The odd limit tells you something about what you&apos;re going<br/>to hear.  A certain set of intervals are considered to be<br/>consonances, and so will come up a lot in chords, and be<br/>used to connect chords.  They might be out of tune but<br/>you&apos;ll get some idea what they&apos;re going to sound like.</p><p>Any interval can be approximated to arbitrary precision by<br/>any two distinct primes.  The prime limit tells you nothing<br/>about the music.  It describes the algebraic structure<br/>behind the tuning.</p><p>In practice, music in a given prime limit will focus on the<br/>simplest ratios within that limit.  We formalize this by<br/>using weighted prime limits.  If the kind of limit isn&apos;t<br/>specified, you can generally assume it&apos;s either an odd<br/>limit or a Tenney-weighted prime limit.  In practice, it<br/>doesn&apos;t usually matter which, because they&apos;ll focus on the<br/>same intervals.  When you do care about an odd limit it&apos;s<br/>best to be explicit about that.</p><p>An odd limit uniquely defines a prime limit.  A prime limit<br/>suggests an odd limit but sometimes there are<br/>alternatives.  For example, the 7-prime limit could be<br/>either the 7-odd or 9-limit (or even a Farey limit or<br/>something else). Odd limits roughly follow Tenney-complexity<br/>cutoffs.  You may choose to state an odd-limit because it<br/>means you list a finite set of intervals and musicians will<br/>tend to be familiar with octave equivalence.  There&apos;s no<br/>cosmic censor preventing you from using intervals outside<br/>the limit you stated. With a temperament, you can even add<br/>intervals from your odd limit to get an approximation of an<br/>interval from a different prime limit.</p><p>                          Graham</p></div><h3><a id=101272 href="#101272">ðŸ”—</a>Billy &#x3C;billygard@...&#x3E;</h3><span>8/16/2011 6:10:05 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, Michael &lt;djtrancendance@...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;&quot;As a last note, keep in mind that the 9-odd-limit actually exists as<br/>&gt; part of the 7-prime-limit, although nothing&apos;s to stop you from talking<br/>&gt; about the 5-prime-limit, 9-odd-limit, or the 2.7.9.11-prime-limit, 11<br/>&gt; odd limit, etc.&quot;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &nbsp;&nbsp; This goes back in my list of &quot;10000 reasons why I hate the term &apos;limit&apos; (being ambiguous between &apos;prime&apos; and &apos;odd&apos;)&quot;.

But as I work with chord tunings, I find that odd-limit determines, visually speaking, how many times an interval can be stacked on each other. For instance a high odd limit with a prime limit of 5 would let you stack just major triads to form extended chords such as the lydian 13th chord using alternating just major and minor 3rds. The kind of dissonance caused by high odd-limit are of a different quality than that caused by high prime limits. An example would be the difference between the 7:9:11 tuning of the augmented triad, and the 16:20:25 (stacked just major 3rds).</p><p>Billy</p></div><h3><a id=101279 href="#101279">ðŸ”—</a>Mike Battaglia &#x3C;battaglia01@...&#x3E;</h3><span>8/17/2011 10:21:56 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>On Mon, Aug 15, 2011 at 3:18 PM, Michael &lt;djtrancendance@...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;&quot;As a last note, keep in mind that the 9-odd-limit actually exists as<br/>&gt; part of the 7-prime-limit, although nothing&apos;s to stop you from talking<br/>&gt; about the 5-prime-limit, 9-odd-limit, or the 2.7.9.11-prime-limit, 11<br/>&gt; odd limit, etc.&quot;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &nbsp; &nbsp; Misinterpreting statement that say limit without saying &quot;prime&quot; or &quot;odd&quot; seems incurably commonplace on this list (even) and elsewhere because people so often just say &quot;limit&quot; without saying what type of limit.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &nbsp; What if we coined a terminology such as &quot;9-limit, lowest prime (LP) 3&quot; or even just 9&lt;3&gt;-limit to represent something with 9-odd-limit, 3-prime-limit (or something else along similar lines)?&nbsp;&nbsp; Then, of course, 7-limit (odd and prime) would become 7&lt;7&gt; limit...and in discussion you could say &lt;7&gt; to infer the prime limit and 7 to infer the odd limit.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As I understand it...odd-limit is essential and most important anyhow (and thus, I&apos;m thinking, should be noted even if you are only discussing prime limit)...since a dyad&apos;s having low prime-limit just generally increases the chance other tones will form lower odd-limit relationships with it, but scientifically guarantees nothing.</p><p>9&lt;3&gt; is pretty neat, but I think that prime-limit is the more<br/>important one. To be honest, I don&apos;t really care about odd-limit at<br/>all, but some people find it useful as a rule of thumb to tell you how<br/>consonant a chord is.

Or it could include chords like 1/1<br/>125/64 27/16 65536/50000, or whatever. I just don&apos;t see any reason to<br/>care about that possibility, and at any rate there are a lot of<br/>5-prime-limit chords that I like that are better described as being<br/>something like 45-odd-limit, and also plenty of 45-odd-limit chords<br/>outside of the 5-limit that I think sound awful. I suppose if you come<br/>from mainly a common practice paradigm, where major 7 chords sound<br/>&quot;dissonant&quot; and add2 chords sound like suspensions that &quot;need to<br/>resolve,&quot; you might find it useful.
