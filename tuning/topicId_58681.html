Maybe somebody can tell me about properties<br/>&gt;of just intonation scales, like conditions they have to satisfy? In<br/>&gt;the Encyclopaedia of Tuning I did find some properties of scales.<br/>&gt;Under &apos;scale&apos; is written: &quot;Scales often, but not always, exhibit<br/>&gt;tetrachordal similarity, and other properties such as MOS,<br/>&gt;propriety, distributional evenness, etc.&quot; However, all these<br/>&gt;properties are only valid for equal tempered scales (or am I<br/>&gt;wrong?). Are there similar properties for just intonation scales? I<br/>&gt;hope somebody can help me.

Chapter 11, &quot;Indian Music.&quot;</p><p>******************************</p><p>An imaginary east-to-west diagonal from Calcutta, near the Bay of<br/>Bengal, to Bombay, on the coast of the Arabian Sea, roughly<br/>divides the subcontinent of India into two geographical and<br/>cultural areas called North India and South India.  The former<br/>region is known for Hindustani music, and the latter, for Carnatic<br/>music.  Although both cultures evolved from the same ancient<br/>tradition, by the 17th century each had developed a separate<br/>musical vocabulary and unique styles in the performance of ragas.</p><p>Before we discuss these two traditions, let us first address the<br/>question, &quot;What is a raga?&quot;  The answer is extremely complex<br/>because ragas are musical expressions that continuously change<br/>in time.  Most ragas consist of two basic elements:  (1) a set of<br/>technical definitions and instructions, transformed into music<br/>through (2) spontaneously improvised performances.  Because<br/>Indian music is inherently melodic in nature, musicians have<br/>created literally thousands of different ragas.  In the 16th and 17th<br/>centuries, theorists attempted to organize this incomprehensible<br/>plethora of ragas by creating organizational systems based on<br/>mathematically defined tunings and combinatorics.  However,<br/>because such efforts compelled theorists and musicians to closely<br/>examine the quintessential relation between the technical and<br/>musical aspects of ragas, these systems profoundly influenced not<br/>only intellectual definitions of ragas, but artistic interpretations as<br/>well.</p><p>In the next five sections, we will examine the evolution of South<br/>Indian ragas in the writings of Ramamatya (1550), Venkatamakhi<br/>(1620), and Govinda (c. 1800).  These three writers focused on a<br/>theme common to all organizational systems, namely, the<br/>principle of abstraction.  Ramamatya was the first Indian theorist<br/>to formulate a system based on a mathematically determined<br/>tuning.  He defined (1) a theoretical 14-tone scale, (2) a practical<br/>12-tone tuning, and (3) a distinction between abstract mela ragas<br/>and musical janya ragas.  He then combined these three concepts<br/>to identify 20 mela ragas, under which he classified more than 60<br/>janya ragas.  Venkatamakhi extended Ramamatya&apos;s approach,<br/>and proposed a system that consists of 72 heptatonic<br/>permutations called melakartas.  He then identified 19 melakartas,<br/>which he used to classify dozens of janya ragas.  Finally, Govinda<br/>extended Venkatamakhi&apos;s basic concept, and defined the present<br/>day system, which consists of 72 modern mela ragas, or 72<br/>theoretically constructed heptatonic scales.</p><p>We may think of these developments as representing three<br/>interrelated stages in the history of South Indian music.<br/>Ramamatya, Venkatamakhi, and Govinda created organizational<br/>systems based on the principle of musical abstraction,<br/>combinatorial abstraction, and theoretical abstraction,<br/>respectively.  As such, these underlying principles do not tell us<br/>how to understand the resulting systems.  Therefore, consider the<br/>following three interpretations.  In the writings of Ramamatya and<br/>Venkatamakhi, the terms &apos;mela ragas&apos; and &apos;melakartas,&apos;<br/>respectively, refer to prototypes - or collections of seven tones -<br/>that function as abstract raga-categories.  In the 16th, 17th, and<br/>18th centuries, theorists and musicians used melas for only one<br/>purpose:  to organize and classify musical ragas.  Consequently,<br/>in the original sense, &apos;melas&apos; never represented regular scales, or<br/>musical ragas.  Figure 29 shows two melas identified by<br/>Ramamatya enclosed in separate circles to convey the impression<br/>of pools of seven tones that similar musical janya ragas have in<br/>common.  In most texts, melas are represented as linear<br/>sequences of notes on a treble staff.  Westerners, when<br/>presented with progressions of notes in regular ascending and/or<br/>descending order, unwittingly interpret such sequences as scales.<br/>Because this tendency seriously interferes with a historical<br/>understanding of South Indian music, I have chosen to equate the<br/>original &apos;melas&apos; with the terms &apos;raga-categories,&apos; &apos;prototypes,&apos; and<br/>&apos;tone pools.&apos;</p><p>******************************</p><p>The concept of &apos;tone pools&apos; is the best that I can offer for a ubiquitous<br/>definition -- not of scales -- but for the fountainheads or primary sources<br/>of scales.</p><p>In other words, a tone pool is to a scale what a zygote is to an<br/>embryo.

The last written paper however (The notion of convexity in music) was the reason that I sent a question to the mailing list.<br/>I will explain. When all 5-limit just intonation intervals are put on a lattice (a lattice like the one used by Longuet-Higgins, Balzano, and others, only I chose the major and minor third to be the unity vectors) musical items like chords and scales can be found in convex sets. I tried to check most of the 5-limit JI scales defined in Scala, and it turned out that a remarkable large part of these scales is convex.<br/>Since I don&apos;t really understand why this is the case, I was hoping to be able to relate this property to other properties of JI scales. And since I couldn&apos;t find any properties of these scales, I sent this question to the list. Also, I was wondering if there are any necessary conditions for a set/sequence of notes to be a scale. But it seems there aren&apos;t..</p><p>&gt; Here are my observations.<br/>&gt; &gt; All rational and irrational tuning systems may include a vast number of<br/>&gt; tones.  Scales include a small number of tones.  Therefore, all<br/>&gt; rational and irrational tuning systems may include a number of scales<br/>&gt; that may approach incomprehensibility.<br/>&gt; &gt; The number of ways 12 tones may be ordered is<br/>&gt; 12! = 479,001,600.0<br/>&gt; &gt; The number of ways 7 tones may be ordered is 7! = 5,040.0.<br/>&gt; &gt; Of these 12 tones, the number of ways 7 tones may be uniquely<br/>&gt; ordered is (12 * 11 * 10 * 9 * 8 * 7 * 6) / 7! = 792.0.<br/>&gt; &gt; Therefore, I surmise that what constitutes a scale cannot be<br/>&gt; universally defined.  Even within a given civilization,<br/>&gt; one can only speak of human musical tendencies.</p><p>This is an interesting point, but I&apos;m not sure if I agree. Indeed, the number of ways to choose 7 from 12 in an ordered way is already quite a large number. However, there are infinitely many just intonation ratios to choose scales from, but not all combinations are considered to be scales, at least not all are ever defined to be a scale. And since (from what I&apos;ve learned) there are some properties for scales, not every random chosen combination from the set of all possible intervals would be a good scale.</p><p>Kraig Grady made the point that what makes a scale is determined by our ears. That would suggest (I think) that if it&apos;s not possible to define scale in a mathematical way, at least there can be made a psychological measure.</p><p>&gt; &gt; The following text is from my manuscript<br/>&gt; Musical Mathematics: A Practice in the Mathematics of Tuning<br/>&gt; Instruments and Analyzing Scales.

But it seems there aren&apos;t..</p><p>A periodicity block constructed from the unison vectors should always<br/>be convex, in that it&apos;s a parallelogram (or higher dimensional<br/>equivalent).  Some of the scales you&apos;re checking are periodicity<br/>blocks.</p><p>I think a Combination Product Set (CPS) will always be convex as well.<br/> At least, you can check that.</p><p>An MOS will naturally be convex in that it&apos;s a square of generators<br/>and periods.  So a convex JI scale will still be convex when<br/>approximated as an MOS, although the reverse isn&apos;t the case.  You can<br/>also prove this from the relationship between MOS and periodicity<br/>blocks.</p><p>Connectedness measures are related to convexity.  A scale is connected<br/>in an odd-limit if any note can be reached from any other note using<br/>only intervals within the odd limit.  Further, if all notes are<br/>connected with complete chords of the odd-limit then it&apos;s chord<br/>connected.  In your case, the relevant limit is 5, and the chords the<br/>major and minor triads.  All convex scales will be connected, and most<br/>will be chord connected (not all, you could just have a run of fifths)<br/>although not all chord connected scales are convex.  Chord connected<br/>scales that aren&apos;t star convex sound bizarre, but I&apos;m not saying<br/>nobody would ever propose one.  Maximising the number of chords within<br/>a scale will lead you towards convexity.</p><p>If you choose ratios to be small relative to the 1/1, that will tend<br/>to give you star convexity, but I don&apos;t know of any measures that<br/>ensure this.  But it is natural to want to move by the shortest number<br/>of consonances from the tonic to any other note in the scale, don&apos;t<br/>you think?

It&apos;s a pretty basic<br/>property, and one which is helpful if you want the scale to have a lot<br/>of consonant chords and intervals. Since this is likely to be a design<br/>consideration for anyone creating a scale, it isn&apos;t surprising to see<br/>it turn up in the final result. Moreover, some methods of JI scale<br/>construction result in a convex scale automatically; an example being<br/>a Fokker block, and another and even more obvious one the Euler genus.</p><p>One thing to note about convexity is that it is not invariant under<br/>the process of projecting down to a lattice of smaller dimension via<br/>tempering. However, for tempered scales convexity is also a<br/>consideration; often discussion of rank two (two-generator)<br/>temperaments has centered on what are called &quot;MOS&quot; or &quot;DE&quot; scales,<br/>where under octave equivalence we have convexity just along a single<br/>chain of generators. The reason for that I think is the same reason<br/>for convexity in general: it tends to give you a lot of (tempered)<br/>consonances if you push it out far enough compared to the complexity<br/>of the temperament.</p><p>By the way, heavily mathematical discussions are something people<br/>sometimes object to on this list, and if you feel the urge we could<br/>move things to the tuning-math list instead.</p></div><h3><a id=58701 href="#58701">ðŸ”—</a>Gene Ward Smith &#x3C;gwsmith@svpal.org&#x3E;</h3><span>5/24/2005 12:43:37 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, Graham Breed &lt;gbreed@g...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt; On 5/24/05, Aline Honingh &lt;ahoningh@s...&gt; wrote:</p><p>&gt; I think a Combination Product Set (CPS) will always be convex as well.<br/>&gt;  At least, you can check that.</p><p>A CPS takes sums of points, and therefore has to give results in the<br/>convex hull of the set of points it is taking sums of.

So a convex JI scale will still be convex when<br/>&gt; approximated as an MOS, although the reverse isn&apos;t the case.</p><p>This doesn&apos;t follow. You can have a nice convex epimorphic scale and<br/>when you project it down to a MOS for the same val find you only get a<br/>modmos. For a simple example, take the scale generated by<br/>(5/4)^i (6/5)^j, -1&lt;=i&lt;=1, -1&lt;=j&lt;=2, octave reduced. This is<br/>epimorphic for &lt;12 19 28|, and if you project to rank one via this<br/>val, the result is trivially epimorphic. If you project to rank two in<br/>the form of meantone, the result is not epimorphic, but is a modmos: a<br/>mod 12 alteration of a Fokker block by diesis adjustments. Of course<br/>it is also clear that normally, taking an et and applying it to this<br/>scale will not give you convexity, as it will for 12.</p></div><h3><a id=58703 href="#58703">ðŸ”—</a>Gene Ward Smith &#x3C;gwsmith@svpal.org&#x3E;</h3><span>5/24/2005 12:56:57 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;Gene Ward Smith&quot; &lt;gwsmith@s...&gt; wrote:</p><p>&gt; A CPS takes sums of points, and therefore has to give results in the<br/>&gt; convex hull of the set of points it is taking sums of.</p><p>Sorry, I was babbling here; the correct convex hull is determined in a<br/>way a little more complicated than this.</p></div><h3><a id=58767 href="#58767">ðŸ”—</a>Aline Honingh &#x3C;ahoningh@science.uva.nl&#x3E;</h3><span>5/26/2005 3:41:28 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Gene Ward Smith wrote:<br/>&gt; &gt; Convexity is invariant under affine transformations, so broadly<br/>&gt; speaking it won&apos;t matter what you use for generators.

Moreover, some methods of JI scale<br/>&gt; construction result in a convex scale automatically; an example being<br/>&gt; a Fokker block, and another and even more obvious one the Euler genus.</p><p>Thanks! this helps,</p><p>Aline</p></div><h3><a id=58780 href="#58780">ðŸ”—</a>Gene Ward Smith &#x3C;gwsmith@svpal.org&#x3E;</h3><span>5/26/2005 5:20:44 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, Aline Honingh &lt;ahoningh@s...&gt; wrote:</p><p>&gt; &gt; Convexity is invariant under affine transformations, so broadly<br/>&gt; &gt; speaking it won&apos;t matter what you use for generators.</p><p>&gt; I know, and therefore it is an interesting property, right?</p><p>Oh, absolutely.
