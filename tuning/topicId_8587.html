It&apos;s interesting to note<br/>that Braxton touches on a whole host of ways in which he&apos;s been<br/>inspired by Harry Partch, and yet he only indirectly alludes to Partch<br/>and tuning at all.</p><p>L: OK. Perhaps we could move on to Sun Ra and Harry Partch?<br/>B: Let me take Harry Partch first. Harry Partch has profoundly<br/>affected me, but I&apos;ve not been able to demonstrate what I&apos;ve learned<br/>from this man. For instance, I&apos;ve always wanted to put out my own<br/>records like Mr Partch did, but I&apos;ve never had the money. His book{1}<br/>would also be very inspirational, and my move to build instruments<br/>would come from Mr Partch&apos;s example. I think he&apos;s a great composer<br/>too; he&apos;s so underrated in this period it&apos;s a damned shame. It&apos;s an<br/>indictment of America that there&apos;s no understanding of, or respect<br/>for, this man&apos;s music.</p><p>The fact that he would look back to the ancients to understand better<br/>what music is, and then build a system based on the fundamentals -<br/>this is what connects me to Harry Partch because that&apos;s exactly what<br/>I&apos;ve been doing. And if I&apos;m allowed to do my work in the future that&apos;s<br/>exactly what I&apos;ll continue to do: go to the ancients and to the<br/>scientist to understand better the route of a given information line<br/>and the transformational potential of music. Harry Partch<br/>short-circuited the whole post-Webern continuum and established a<br/>whole other area for investigation. The dynamic implications of his<br/>music, as well as its actual beauty, affected me and helped me develop<br/>the mind-set to begin looking at my own evolution.</p><p>---------------------<br/>{1} _Genesis of a Music_ (1974). Partch (1901-74) devised his own<br/>forty-three-note-to-the-octave scale, designed and built his own<br/>instruments to play this music, and released his first records on his<br/>own Gate 5 label. He followed the ancient belief that music was part<br/>of a composite culture that also included poetry, dance and theater;<br/>many of his own works are music-dramas that attempt to re-create<br/>elements like magic and ritual now generally vanished from Western art<br/>music.</p><p>Dan</p></div>
