I can buy that line of reasoning.</p><p>While this viewpoint is certainly &apos;correct...&apos; I think as a &quot;line of<br/>reasoning&quot; it both separates 144-tET from a/its notational context, and<br/>fails to acknowledge or demarcate any sort of practical distinctions<br/>between the +/- 4&amp;1/6thc max error in 144-tET, and say a ~91% error @ +/-<br/>~27c in 1-tET, or a ~91% error @ +/- ~.05c in 1200-tET.</p><p>Dan</p></div>
