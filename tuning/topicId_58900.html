There is nothing in using _ratios_ that implies<br/>beatlessness. And there is nothing that requires every interval in a<br/>JI scale to be a just interval. But a JI scale has to have _some_ just<br/>intervals. In fact I think a JI scale ought to be fully connected by<br/>them, with better than linear connectivity, to qualify (this avoids<br/>having to say that 19-ET is JI due to its chain of just minor thirds).</p><p>And if a JI scale has more than about 6 notes then it can&apos;t help but<br/>contain many non-just intervals.

Maybe it was a hundred years<br/>ago, but maybe it only started around when the first digital<br/>synthesizers became available. In any case, there was an awful lot of<br/>time before a hundred years ago, when the justness of an interval<br/>meant something you could actually _hear_. I see no reason to give<br/>that up.</p><p>&gt;     And one again why should we not apply the same standard to ET, that<br/>&gt; is is only tunable by Machine.</p><p>Because<br/>(a) ET usn&apos;t the opposite of JI, non-JI is.

Sometimes they will identify an<br/>equal-tempered chord as &quot;happy, upbeat,&quot; and the same chord in just<br/>intonation as &quot;sad, gloomy.&quot; Of course, this is the first time they&apos;ve<br/>ever heard anything but equal temperament, and they&apos;re far more<br/>familiar with the first sound than the second. But I think they<br/>correctly hit on the point that equal temperament chords do have a<br/>kind of active buzz to them, a level of harmonic excitement and<br/>intensity. By contrast, just-intonation chords are much calmer, more<br/>passive; you literally have to slow down to listen to them. (As Terry<br/>Riley says, Western music is fast because it&apos;s not in tune.) It makes<br/>sense that American teenagers would identify tranquil, purely<br/>consonant harmony as moody and depressing. Listening from the other<br/>side, I&apos;ve learned to hear equal temperament music as a kind of aural<br/>caffeine, overly busy and nervous-making. If you&apos;re used to getting<br/>that kind of buzz from music, you feel the lack of it as a deprivation<br/>when it&apos;s not there. But do we need it? Most cultures use music for<br/>meditation, and ours may be the only culture that doesn&apos;t. With our<br/>tuning, we can&apos;t.&apos;&apos;</p><p>I&apos;ve described just chords as having a granite-slab quality, of<br/>steadiness and a kind of purity.

I need the sharps and<br/>flats reversed as in the meantone notation of 43tET, with the Rast<br/>scale composed of:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; 1/1 9/8 5/4 4/3 3/2 27/16 15/8 2/1<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; where the 6th degree=huseyni may be 5/3 at times.</p><p>If you take 157 steps out of 270, you get something very close to<br/>25/43--only 1/10 of a cent sharper, which isn&apos;t really audible. So<br/>there is no question 270 can handle the meantone aspect. However, you<br/>say sometimes you want a 27/16, and sometimes you want a 5/3, which<br/>means you are not *in* a meantone system and the whole meantone thing<br/>may be a complete red herring. This is a difference of a comma, and<br/>meantone simply erases it. It does not and cannot distinguish between<br/>rast and huseyni as you have defined them; however 53 *can*.</p><p>&gt; All these pitches MUST be naturally indicated on the staff, because<br/>Rast is the mother of all maqams.</p><p>53 is a combination of schismatic and kleismic tempering, and the<br/>schismatic part means that notating on a staff is very natural for it.<br/>However, you get a Pythagorean sound, unless you use Fb in place of E,<br/>etc. The flat is *lower* than the sharp; this is *not* a meantone<br/>system but it is not clear at this point you want one.</p><p>&gt; Furthermore, I require that the 3rd and 7th degrees be flattened a<br/>notch (possibly with the already known - but semiologically revised -<br/>quarter-tone accidentals) whenever needed.</p><p>If you know how large a &quot;notch&quot; is, the step size of your equal<br/>division must be at least a &quot;notch&quot;. If a notch is about a comma, then<br/>certainly 55 can flatten its version of 27/16 by a comma. However, if<br/>it does that you don&apos;t get its version of 5/3, or anything very close.<br/>You get the 55-et version of 3375/2048 instead, if we stick to the<br/>5-limit. This is the 55 version of 128/125 lower than 27/16, or<br/>equivalently the 55 version of 2048/2025 lower than 5/3; this all gets<br/>identified in 55 or any meantone system, because (128/125)/(2048/2025)<br/>= 81/80, and (27/16)/(5/3) = 81/80. Meantone is incapable of making<br/>these distinctions, but shismatic can.</p><p>(I hope George understands why I cannot sacrifice current<br/>understanding in favor of a rock-hard symbology)<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; In 270tET, the pitches of the C major scale are closer to Suz-i<br/>Dilara, or the Pythagorean major scale:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; 1/1 9/8 81/64 4/3 3/2 27/16 243/128 2/1</p><p>That&apos;s assuming you use 158 steps for a fifth, not 157. If you use 157<br/>you definately get the diatonic major scale, which is rast if I<br/>understand this business right. You *cannot* get both the diatonic<br/>major and the Pythagorean scales without going to soemthing like 270.<br/>If you want an equal temperament which supports both, 270 does. If you<br/>want something smaller which still does, it now depends on how flat<br/>you will allow your meantone fifth to be, and how sharp your<br/>Pythagorean fifth. How flat can the fifth of rast be allowed to be?</p><p>&gt; 1. The system must have ALL diatonic major scales fixed at default<br/>Rast intervals, expressed solely by standart Western accidentals<br/>through all tones.</p><p>What&apos;s a default rast interval?</p><p>&gt; 2. The fifths of the scale must be so narrowed as to result in a<br/>notation akin to 43tET.</p><p>270 certainly does that; it is *very* close to 43.</p><p>&gt; 3. The system must be sufficiently expressed using ONLY the<br/>quarter-tone accidentals whose meanings may be re-specified<br/>accordingly. That is to ensure transition from the old concept to the new.</p><p>270 can be expressed in staff notation without quatertones, though it<br/>would be a huge mess. Hence, it certainly can be expressed *with*<br/>quartertones. 11 steps of 270 gives a 48.889 cent quarter tone, its<br/>version of 36/35, which is 48.770 cents. This is often a good size of<br/>quartertone to use if you are thinking in septimal and not just<br/>5-limit terms.</p><p>In any case, given your requirements it seems you *must*, whether you<br/>like it or not, use some system like 270, in which case why not 270<br/>itself?</p></div><h3><a id=59035 href="#59035">ðŸ”—</a>George D.

However, it is indeed<br/>outrageous for me to do so as you say.</p><p>Perhaps it was a bit harsh of me to use the word &quot;outrageous&quot;.  I&apos;ve<br/>been going with too little sleep lately, and I had only a few minutes<br/>before leaving when I posted that message and didn&apos;t even take time<br/>to think of putting a &quot;winkie&quot; ;-) after that statement -- until<br/>after I had sent the message and gone out the door.  (Haste and<br/>fatigue are not conducive to civility.)</p><p>Anyway, I&apos;ve taken a few minutes to think over what you&apos;ve said in<br/>your response, and I&apos;ve concluded that perhaps it would not be<br/>necessary to abandon a correct notational syntax in order to achieve<br/>your objectives.</p><p>&gt; Thus, perhaps you can help me. My main concern is achieving a<br/>meantone notation (sharps &amp; flats reversed, E closer to 5/4)</p><p>By &quot;sharps and flats reversed,&quot; I assume that you mean that<br/>neighboring pairs of sharps and flats, such as F# and Gb, will have<br/>the sharped nominal lower in pitch than the flatted one -- the<br/>reverse of a Pythagorean sequence.</p><p>&gt; of sufficient tone resolution while being able to transpose this<br/>system equally everywhere.</p><p>If you mean &quot;sufficient resolution&quot; of pitch for Maquam music, then I<br/>would say that 43 is probably your best choice, since it&apos;s comparable<br/>to 41.  You would be a better judge about whether that amount of<br/>resolution is sufficient.</p><p>&gt; ...<br/>&gt; If I do so, however, and choose any one of 41, 53 or 65 ETs with a<br/>near-pure fifth, I must use your 5-comma flat for the 3rd and 7th<br/>degrees, and for the 6th degree when the occasion demands it.<br/>HOWEVER, I must avoid this at all costs. Rast scale for all<br/>instruments must be notated as I delineated above.</p><p>You said that you wished to use the Tartini accidentals.  A<br/>symantically proper way to employ the Tartini &quot;semisharp&quot; symbol<br/>would be as the 11M diesis (medium-size 11 diesis, 32:33, ~53 cents)<br/>for 2 degrees of 43, which (at ~55 cents) is in very good agreement<br/>for melodic purposes.  The single-degree symbol of 43 would then be<br/>the 11L diesis (apotome-minus-11M), which does not have a counterpart<br/>in the Tartini scheme of things, unless you were to combine a sharp<br/>with a backwards (&quot;semi-&quot;) flat -- but I believe you would more<br/>likely want a single symbol instead.</p><p>It would be reasonable to have the 11M and 11L symbols similar in<br/>physical size (as they are in Sagittal), because their rational sizes<br/>are not very different (53 vs. 60 cents).  Several months ago I took<br/>the time to experiment with some symbols (both upward and downward)<br/>for 11L that could have been used to expand the 41-tone Tartini-plus<br/>symbols that we were working on for use in 53-ET.  They&apos;re similar in<br/>appearance to the 11L Sagittal symbols, but in a style closer to the<br/>Tartini set.  If you&apos;re interested in seeing them, I could make a<br/>figure showing a proposed 43-tone symbol sequence.</p><p>Best,</p><p>--George</p></div><h3><a id=59039 href="#59039">ðŸ”—</a>Ozan Yarman &#x3C;ozanyarman@superonline.com&#x3E;</h3><span>6/10/2005 3:14:33 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Ah, that was the pure version.

So<br/>  there is no question 270 can handle the meantone aspect. However, you<br/>  say sometimes you want a 27/16, and sometimes you want a 5/3, which<br/>  means you are not *in* a meantone system and the whole meantone thing<br/>  may be a complete red herring. This is a difference of a comma, and<br/>  meantone simply erases it. It does not and cannot distinguish between<br/>  rast and huseyni as you have defined them; however 53 *can*.</p><p> Yuck! I don&apos;t want 53. It&apos;s completely against Maqam Music intervals and notation. The misconception is based on thinking in terms of pure fifths. However, that gives us a Pythagorean notation where the apotome sharp ascends the apotome flat. That cannot be the case in Maqam Music. That Arel-Ezgi distorted the correct symbology to cram everything inside awkwardly is proof enough that this system cannot be a basis for expressing Maqams.</p><p>I know that meantone merges 5-limit JI with pythagorean. But still, the system I propose embodies both of these in a sense, where one can re-specify 3-limit JI through adjacent tones.</p><p>  &gt; All these pitches MUST be naturally indicated on the staff, because<br/>  Rast is the mother of all maqams.</p><p>  53 is a combination of schismatic and kleismic tempering, and the<br/>  schismatic part means that notating on a staff is very natural for it.<br/>  However, you get a Pythagorean sound, unless you use Fb in place of E,<br/>  etc. The flat is *lower* than the sharp; this is *not* a meantone<br/>  system but it is not clear at this point you want one.</p><p>No no no! Impossible. I want a meantone notation with 5-limit JI sounds for the natural keys approximated very closely by meantone pitches. I believe, the 79-tone system I proposed is good enough for it where I also get special tone colors. Should I call it a well-temperament then?</p><p>  &gt; Furthermore, I require that the 3rd and 7th degrees be flattened a<br/>  notch (possibly with the already known - but semiologically revised -<br/>  quarter-tone accidentals) whenever needed.</p><p>  If you know how large a &quot;notch&quot; is, the step size of your equal<br/>  division must be at least a &quot;notch&quot;. If a notch is about a comma, then<br/>  certainly 55 can flatten its version of 27/16 by a comma. However, if<br/>  it does that you don&apos;t get its version of 5/3, or anything very close.<br/>  You get the 55-et version of 3375/2048 instead, if we stick to the<br/>  5-limit. This is the 55 version of 128/125 lower than 27/16, or<br/>  equivalently the 55 version of 2048/2025 lower than 5/3; this all gets<br/>  identified in 55 or any meantone system, because (128/125)/(2048/2025)<br/>  = 81/80, and (27/16)/(5/3) = 81/80. Meantone is incapable of making<br/>  these distinctions, but shismatic can.</p><p>Precisely. The notch must be half a comma at most. 79 is the lowest cardinality whose ET gives me meantone notation with ALMOST correct pitches, which I tweaked a little in order to achieve a super-pythagorean version of Suz-i Dilara. I am aware that 5/3 and 27/16 are compacted into one pitch, but still, alternate ratios can come to the rescue as you very well demonstrated. All in all, the theory and practice will not be an exact match, but a fine-granularity approximation at best.</p><p>  (I hope George understands why I cannot sacrifice current<br/>  understanding in favor of a rock-hard symbology)<br/>  &gt;<br/>  &gt; In 270tET, the pitches of the C major scale are closer to Suz-i<br/>  Dilara, or the Pythagorean major scale:<br/>  &gt;<br/>  &gt; 1/1 9/8 81/64 4/3 3/2 27/16 243/128 2/1</p><p>  That&apos;s assuming you use 158 steps for a fifth, not 157. If you use 157<br/>  you definately get the diatonic major scale, which is rast if I<br/>  understand this business right. You *cannot* get both the diatonic<br/>  major and the Pythagorean scales without going to soemthing like 270.</p><p>How about Zarlino major and super-Pythagorean major together then? You must understand that no one can handle 270 mandals per octave! That number has to be doubled due to the diatonical ascent of the gamut of the Qanun. 79 is indeed pushing the barrier to its limit.</p><p>  If you want an equal temperament which supports both, 270 does. If you<br/>  want something smaller which still does, it now depends on how flat<br/>  you will allow your meantone fifth to be, and how sharp your<br/>  Pythagorean fifth. How flat can the fifth of rast be allowed to be?</p><p>No less than 697 cents. Preferably somewhere around 698.</p><p>  &gt; 1. The system must have ALL diatonic major scales fixed at default<br/>  Rast intervals, expressed solely by standart Western accidentals<br/>  through all tones.</p><p>  What&apos;s a default rast interval?</p><p>The default Zarlino diatonical gamut intervals that I gave previously.</p><p>  &gt; 2. The fifths of the scale must be so narrowed as to result in a<br/>  notation akin to 43tET.</p><p>  270 certainly does that; it is *very* close to 43.</p><p>Not to mention extremely crowded. I do not need to modulate everywhere, just the 30 keys common to Western Music practice.</p><p>  &gt; 3. The system must be sufficiently expressed using ONLY the<br/>  quarter-tone accidentals whose meanings may be re-specified<br/>  accordingly. That is to ensure transition from the old concept to the new.</p><p>  270 can be expressed in staff notation without quatertones, though it<br/>  would be a huge mess. Hence, it certainly can be expressed *with*<br/>  quartertones. 11 steps of 270 gives a 48.889 cent quarter tone, its<br/>  version of 36/35, which is 48.770 cents. This is often a good size of<br/>  quartertone to use if you are thinking in septimal and not just<br/>  5-limit terms.</p><p>For gosh sakes, 270 is gargantuan, nobody can play it with the Qanun. Forget it will you?</p><p>In any case, given your requirements it seems you *must*, whether you<br/>like it or not, use some system like 270, in which case why not 270<br/>itself?</p><p>For practical reasons, is it not obvious?</p><p>Cordially,<br/>Ozan</p></div><h3><a id=59044 href="#59044">ðŸ”—</a>Ozan Yarman &#x3C;ozanyarman@superonline.com&#x3E;</h3><span>6/10/2005 3:39:39 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>----- Original Message -----<br/>  From: George D.

However, it is indeed<br/>  outrageous for me to do so as you say.</p><p>  Perhaps it was a bit harsh of me to use the word &quot;outrageous&quot;.  I&apos;ve<br/>  been going with too little sleep lately, and I had only a few minutes<br/>  before leaving when I posted that message and didn&apos;t even take time<br/>  to think of putting a &quot;winkie&quot; ;-) after that statement -- until<br/>  after I had sent the message and gone out the door.  (Haste and<br/>  fatigue are not conducive to civility.)</p><p>Understandably so dear George, it&apos;s quite alright.</p><p>  Anyway, I&apos;ve taken a few minutes to think over what you&apos;ve said in<br/>  your response, and I&apos;ve concluded that perhaps it would not be<br/>  necessary to abandon a correct notational syntax in order to achieve<br/>  your objectives.</p><p>If indeed our joint collaboration produces dazzling results, who would be happier than myself?</p><p>  &gt; Thus, perhaps you can help me. My main concern is achieving a<br/>  meantone notation (sharps &amp; flats reversed, E closer to 5/4)</p><p>  By &quot;sharps and flats reversed,&quot; I assume that you mean that<br/>  neighboring pairs of sharps and flats, such as F# and Gb, will have<br/>  the sharped nominal lower in pitch than the flatted one -- the<br/>  reverse of a Pythagorean sequence.</p><p>Exactly.</p><p>  &gt; of sufficient tone resolution while being able to transpose this<br/>  system equally everywhere.</p><p>  If you mean &quot;sufficient resolution&quot; of pitch for Maquam music, then I<br/>  would say that 43 is probably your best choice, since it&apos;s comparable<br/>  to 41.  You would be a better judge about whether that amount of<br/>  resolution is sufficient.</p><p>But dear George, the issue is not a crude approximation when it comes to affixing the mandals of a Qanun. I assure you, 43tET cannot hope to suffice any more than 41. 55 or 67 don&apos;t cut it either. I had to go all the way up to 79, and even then, I have to be content with a wolf of 711 cents, which I am hoping to conceal with timbral articulations. Do you think it feasible to sound a super-pythagorean C major within this modified 79tET that I&apos;ve been proposing?</p><p>  &gt; ...<br/>  &gt; If I do so, however, and choose any one of 41, 53 or 65 ETs with a<br/>  near-pure fifth, I must use your 5-comma flat for the 3rd and 7th<br/>  degrees, and for the 6th degree when the occasion demands it.<br/>  HOWEVER, I must avoid this at all costs. Rast scale for all<br/>  instruments must be notated as I delineated above.</p><p>  You said that you wished to use the Tartini accidentals.  A<br/>  symantically proper way to employ the Tartini &quot;semisharp&quot; symbol<br/>  would be as the 11M diesis (medium-size 11 diesis, 32:33, ~53 cents)<br/>  for 2 degrees of 43, which (at ~55 cents) is in very good agreement<br/>  for melodic purposes.  The single-degree symbol of 43 would then be<br/>  the 11L diesis (apotome-minus-11M), which does not have a counterpart<br/>  in the Tartini scheme of things, unless you were to combine a sharp<br/>  with a backwards (&quot;semi-&quot;) flat -- but I believe you would more<br/>  likely want a single symbol instead.</p><p>Certainly! I do not dispute for a moment that your semiology is perfectly well thought of. However, you must understand that Maqam Music has been expressed for centuries through only 17 perdes which stood for at least half a dozen ratios each.</p><p>  It would be reasonable to have the 11M and 11L symbols similar in<br/>  physical size (as they are in Sagittal), because their rational sizes<br/>  are not very different (53 vs. 60 cents).  Several months ago I took<br/>  the time to experiment with some symbols (both upward and downward)<br/>  for 11L that could have been used to expand the 41-tone Tartini-plus<br/>  symbols that we were working on for use in 53-ET.  They&apos;re similar in<br/>  appearance to the 11L Sagittal symbols, but in a style closer to the<br/>  Tartini set.  If you&apos;re interested in seeing them, I could make a<br/>  figure showing a proposed 43-tone symbol sequence.</p><p>Do please show them to me.</p><p>  Best,</p><p>  --George</p><p>  Cordially,<br/>  Ozan</p></div><h3><a id=59046 href="#59046">ðŸ”—</a>monz &#x3C;monz@tonalsoft.com&#x3E;</h3><span>6/10/2005 8:01:44 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>hi Gene,</p><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;Gene Ward Smith&quot; &lt;gwsmith@s...&gt; wrote:</p><p>&gt; 53 is a combination of schismatic and kleismic tempering,<br/>&gt; and the schismatic part means that notating on a staff is<br/>&gt; very natural for it.</p><p>Can you explain why that is so?</p><p>-monz</p></div><h3><a id=59047 href="#59047">ðŸ”—</a>Gene Ward Smith &#x3C;gwsmith@svpal.org&#x3E;</h3><span>6/10/2005 9:04:18 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;Ozan Yarman&quot; &lt;ozanyarman@s...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt; Ah, that was the pure version.

With 43 you could<br/>still represent ratios with nominal-accidental combinations (with<br/>fewer accidentals than required for 41), but there would be places<br/>where the notational fifth would be false by a 5-comma, which would<br/>not be very bad if you didn&apos;t have free modulation as a requirement.<br/>It appears to me that you&apos;re attempting an approach that, when<br/>applied to just intonation, is similar to what Ben Johnston did, and<br/>the majority opinion in this group is that such an approach is too<br/>confusing when you&apos;re modulating from one key to another, because the<br/>false fifths maintain their absolute locations, which causes them to<br/>occur in various locations relative to the tonic note.  If, on the<br/>other hand, you&apos;re advocating some sort of flexible notation in which<br/>the false fifths move along with the tonic note so as to maintain<br/>their positions relative to the tonic, then the notation may tend to<br/>be confusing in that notated intervals are not constant in size, but<br/>change according to the key.</p><p>For 79 you speak of a &quot;wolf of 711 cents&quot;.  The wide fifth of 79 is<br/>almost 714 cents.  I don&apos;t understand your requirements well enough<br/>to see why 79 appeals to you.  While it is a sort of meantone tuning,<br/>its best 4:5 is not arrived at by a chain of 4 fifths.</p><p>&gt; Do you think it feasible to sound a super-pythagorean C major<br/>within this modified 79tET that I&apos;ve been proposing?</p><p>By this are you referring to a triad with ratios 1/1, 9/7, 3/2?  The<br/>79 division is not 7-limit consistent (as to 5 vs. 7) or 1,3,7,9-<br/>consistent, for that matter.  Unless this inconsistency is something<br/>you&apos;ve found a way to exploit for your particular purposes, I expect<br/>that you&apos;ll be encountering problems with it.</p><p>&gt;   &gt; ...<br/>&gt;   &gt; If I do so, however, and choose any one of 41, 53 or 65 ETs<br/>with a<br/>&gt;   near-pure fifth, I must use your 5-comma flat for the 3rd and 7th<br/>&gt;   degrees, and for the 6th degree when the occasion demands it.<br/>&gt;   HOWEVER, I must avoid this at all costs. Rast scale for all<br/>&gt;   instruments must be notated as I delineated above.</p><p>The cleanest way to notate JI in which the 5-comma occurs is to use a<br/>5-comma symbol; however you say that must avoid this.</p><p>You expressed an interest in 31-ET, and also in flexible intonation<br/>and ratios of 7 (as I infer from your &quot;superpythagorean&quot; comment.<br/>Since 31 represents both 4:5 and 4:7 extremely well, is 11-limit<br/>consistent, and is also one of the very best meantones available,<br/>would you be interested in some sort of adaptive JI based on 217-ET,<br/>a multiple of 31?  You could use the Tartini accidentals for all of<br/>the pitches of 31 and perhaps supplement them with small arrows<br/>placed (optionally) to the left to serve as a guide (e.g., as<br/>something like diacritical marks for Maqam musicians in training) to<br/>indicate the direction and amount that the pitch should be adjusted<br/>(in increments of ~5.5 cents).  You might need them only rarely if<br/>most of the adjustments are only a single increment.  All of the<br/>pitches of 217-ET may be reached by adjusting the closest pitch of 31-<br/>ET by no more than ~17 cents (3 increments), which is still less than<br/>a 5-comma.</p><p>BTW, should you need some small arrows, there are already some<br/>Sagittal symbols for 1, 2, and 3 increments of 217-ET that could be<br/>used in combination with the Tartini accidentals for this purpose.<br/>Should you be interested, you can see them in our Sagittal paper:<br/><a href="http://dkeenan.com/sagittal/Sagittal.pdf">http://dkeenan.com/sagittal/Sagittal.pdf</a><br/>on page 16, Figure 9: the first 3 symbols in the row for 217 show<br/>upward-pointing arrows; the down-arrows would simply be (vertical)<br/>mirror-images of these.</p><p>&gt; ...<br/>&gt;   It would be reasonable to have the 11M and 11L symbols similar in<br/>&gt;   physical size (as they are in Sagittal), because their rational<br/>sizes<br/>&gt;   are not very different (53 vs. 60 cents).  Several months ago I<br/>took<br/>&gt;   the time to experiment with some symbols (both upward and<br/>downward)<br/>&gt;   for 11L that could have been used to expand the 41-tone Tartini-<br/>plus<br/>&gt;   symbols that we were working on for use in 53-ET.

The<br/>Sagittal paper:<br/><a href="http://dkeenan.com/sagittal/Sagittal.pdf">http://dkeenan.com/sagittal/Sagittal.pdf</a><br/>also contains a footnote (#16 on page 20) suggesting that instruments<br/>in 19, 31, or 38-ET could easily be used for JI, so this idea has<br/>been around for at least a few years.</p><p>&gt; but Ozan seems to find more interest in<br/>&gt; multiples of 53.</p><p>Okay, hold on a minute -- there&apos;s a connection to be made.</p><p>I believe you asked how Dave and I would notate 159.

I need the three kinds of fifths I mentioned.</p><p>  It appears to me that you&apos;re attempting an approach that, when<br/>  applied to just intonation, is similar to what Ben Johnston did, and<br/>  the majority opinion in this group is that such an approach is too<br/>  confusing when you&apos;re modulating from one key to another, because the<br/>  false fifths maintain their absolute locations, which causes them to<br/>  occur in various locations relative to the tonic note.</p><p>  I don&apos;t know about Mr. Johnston&apos;s approach, but I believe you are confusing 79 MOS with 79tET. It is my incapacity to define concepts that misled you, I apologize about that!</p><p>   If, on the<br/>  other hand, you&apos;re advocating some sort of flexible notation in which<br/>  the false fifths move along with the tonic note so as to maintain<br/>  their positions relative to the tonic, then the notation may tend to<br/>  be confusing in that notated intervals are not constant in size, but<br/>  change according to the key.<br/>  That is so indeed. the 79 MOS with three usable perfect fifths results in a Well-Temperament that is both Meantone and Pythagorean at the same time.</p><p>  For 79 you speak of a &quot;wolf of 711 cents&quot;.  The wide fifth of 79 is<br/>  almost 714 cents.  I don&apos;t understand your requirements well enough<br/>  to see why 79 appeals to you.  While it is a sort of meantone tuning,<br/>  its best 4:5 is not arrived at by a chain of 4 fifths.</p><p>  I was still formulating an infant, see? The new correct values rounded off I have provided above. By choosing 695 as basis, I can construct the Zarlino&apos;s diatonical scale where E is close enough to 5/4 to suit my purposes.</p><p>  &gt; Do you think it feasible to sound a super-pythagorean C major<br/>  within this modified 79tET that I&apos;ve been proposing?</p><p>  By this are you referring to a triad with ratios 1/1, 9/7, 3/2?  The<br/>  79 division is not 7-limit consistent (as to 5 vs. 7) or 1,3,7,9-<br/>  consistent, for that matter.  Unless this inconsistency is something<br/>  you&apos;ve found a way to exploit for your particular purposes, I expect<br/>  that you&apos;ll be encountering problems with it.</p><p>  I hope you can make an equally thorough analysis for my &grave;79 MOS out of 159tET&grave;. I don&apos;t think it is problematic in any way, do you?</p><p>  &gt;   &gt; ...<br/>  &gt;   &gt; If I do so, however, and choose any one of 41, 53 or 65 ETs<br/>  with a<br/>  &gt;   near-pure fifth, I must use your 5-comma flat for the 3rd and 7th<br/>  &gt;   degrees, and for the 6th degree when the occasion demands it.<br/>  &gt;   HOWEVER, I must avoid this at all costs. Rast scale for all<br/>  &gt;   instruments must be notated as I delineated above.</p><p>  The cleanest way to notate JI in which the 5-comma occurs is to use a<br/>  5-comma symbol; however you say that must avoid this.</p><p>  Unavoidably so.</p><p>  You expressed an interest in 31-ET, and also in flexible intonation<br/>  and ratios of 7 (as I infer from your &quot;superpythagorean&quot; comment.<br/>  Since 31 represents both 4:5 and 4:7 extremely well, is 11-limit<br/>  consistent, and is also one of the very best meantones available,<br/>  would you be interested in some sort of adaptive JI based on 217-ET,<br/>  a multiple of 31?</p><p>  Uh, I am not sure, but I can always tell a good marketing strategy when I see one!</p><p>   You could use the Tartini accidentals for all of<br/>  the pitches of 31 and perhaps supplement them with small arrows<br/>  placed (optionally) to the left to serve as a guide (e.g., as<br/>  something like diacritical marks for Maqam musicians in training) to<br/>  indicate the direction and amount that the pitch should be adjusted<br/>  (in increments of ~5.5 cents).  You might need them only rarely if<br/>  most of the adjustments are only a single increment.  All of the<br/>  pitches of 217-ET may be reached by adjusting the closest pitch of 31-<br/>  ET by no more than ~17 cents (3 increments), which is still less than<br/>  a 5-comma.</p><p>  It certainly deserves attention, but is not 79 MOS out of 159tET a better, simpler alternative that encompasses both meantone and pythagorean notations so as to express both Rast and Suz-i Dilara as C natural gamme on the staff?</p><p>  BTW, should you need some small arrows, there are already some<br/>  Sagittal symbols for 1, 2, and 3 increments of 217-ET that could be<br/>  used in combination with the Tartini accidentals for this purpose.<br/>  Should you be interested, you can see them in our Sagittal paper:<br/>  <a href="http://dkeenan.com/sagittal/Sagittal.pdf">http://dkeenan.com/sagittal/Sagittal.pdf</a><br/>  on page 16, Figure 9: the first 3 symbols in the row for 217 show<br/>  upward-pointing arrows; the down-arrows would simply be (vertical)<br/>  mirror-images of these.</p><p>  I was more inclined to expressing each pack of tones within a certain region by a single accidental alone, whose meaning would depend on the flow of the maqam that I would painstakingly explain in minute detail.</p><p>  &gt; ...<br/>  &gt;   It would be reasonable to have the 11M and 11L symbols similar in<br/>  &gt;   physical size (as they are in Sagittal), because their rational<br/>  sizes<br/>  &gt;   are not very different (53 vs. 60 cents).  Several months ago I<br/>  took<br/>  &gt;   the time to experiment with some symbols (both upward and<br/>  downward)<br/>  &gt;   for 11L that could have been used to expand the 41-tone Tartini-<br/>  plus<br/>  &gt;   symbols that we were working on for use in 53-ET.

My<br/>  thoughts about this came together before I had read and digested your<br/>  latest (about the 79-MOS), so I&apos;m having to volley them back at a<br/>  moving target. :-)</p><p>  I&apos;m sure my evasive manoeuvres are confusing. But I assure you, I&apos;m not running to and fro without purpose!</p><p>  &gt; [GS:]<br/>  &gt;    You could use the Tartini accidentals for all of<br/>  &gt;   the pitches of 31 and perhaps supplement them with small arrows<br/>  &gt;   placed (optionally) to the left to serve as a guide (e.g., as<br/>  &gt;   something like diacritical marks for Maqam musicians in training)<br/>  to<br/>  &gt;   indicate the direction and amount that the pitch should be<br/>  adjusted<br/>  &gt;   (in increments of ~5.5 cents).  You might need them only rarely<br/>  if<br/>  &gt;   most of the adjustments are only a single increment.  All of the<br/>  &gt;   pitches of 217-ET may be reached by adjusting the closest pitch<br/>  of 31-<br/>  &gt;   ET by no more than ~17 cents (3 increments), which is still less<br/>  than<br/>  &gt;   a 5-comma.<br/>  &gt;<br/>  &gt; [OY:]<br/>  &gt;   It certainly deserves attention, but is not 79 MOS out of 159tET<br/>  a better, simpler alternative that encompasses both meantone and<br/>  pythagorean notations so as to express both Rast and Suz-i Dilara as<br/>  C natural gamme on the staff?</p><p>  I don&apos;t know, because I haven&apos;t taken a close look at that MOS and<br/>  don&apos;t know enough about the maqamat to make any judgment about its<br/>  suitability.  (At the moment there are too many demands on my time to<br/>  get too involved in something like this, because I know from past<br/>  experience that it will take much more of my time than I intended.  I<br/>  expected the Sagittal notation project to take several months, but<br/>  after more than 3 years it&apos;s still going ahead &quot;full steam.&quot;)</p><p>  It&apos;s pleasing to see that all good things don&apos;t come to an end.</p><p>  &gt;   &gt; ...<br/>  &gt; [GS:]<br/>  &gt;   &gt;   It would be reasonable to have the 11M and 11L symbols<br/>  similar in<br/>  &gt;   &gt;   physical size (as they are in Sagittal), because their<br/>  rational sizes<br/>  &gt;   &gt;   are not very different (53 vs. 60 cents).  Several months ago<br/>  I took<br/>  &gt;   &gt;   the time to experiment with some symbols (both upward and<br/>  downward)<br/>  &gt;   &gt;   for 11L that could have been used to expand the 41-tone<br/>  Tartini-plus<br/>  &gt;   &gt;   symbols that we were working on for use in 53-ET.  They&apos;re<br/>  similar in<br/>  &gt;   &gt;   appearance to the 11L Sagittal symbols, but in a style closer<br/>  to the<br/>  &gt;   &gt;   Tartini set.  If you&apos;re interested in seeing them, I could<br/>  make a<br/>  &gt;   &gt;   figure showing a proposed 43-tone symbol sequence.<br/>  &gt;   &gt;<br/>  &gt;   &gt; [OY:]<br/>  &gt;   &gt; Do please show them to me.<br/>  &gt;<br/>  &gt; [GS:]<br/>  &gt;   Only if you promise not to use them (now that I&apos;ve suggested<br/>  31).  ;-)<br/>  &gt;<br/>  &gt; [OY:]<br/>  &gt;   Uh, are they poisonous?

Could we represent 55, 67 and 79 with a single notation?</p><p>  &gt; [OY:]<br/>  &gt;  So, will you help me notate this 79 MOS using only your wonderous<br/>  quarter-tone accidentals?</p><p>  Please, they&apos;re Tartini&apos;s (and Mildred Couper&apos;s) accidentals, and I<br/>  don&apos;t see exactly how they would be used in this MOS.  With the<br/>  meantone fifth of 159, the apotome is 8deg, but you find the interval<br/>  of 4deg (semi-apotome) only after making a chain of 76 meantone<br/>  fourths (assuming that&apos;s an appropriate way to use the symbol).</p><p>  Something tells me that some symbols should be less attached to the cycle of fifths, and be taken with a grain of salt.</p><p>   My reason for suggesting a hemi-(meantone-)fifth generator to Gene is<br/>  that it&apos;s an easy way to get the semi-apotome into the chain of<br/>  intervals, but then I haven&apos;t checked to see how many tones would be<br/>  in the MOS&apos;s of that generator.

Are 13/12 and 12/11 represented by the same number of steps?</p><p>Yes, at least as long as the disjunct step does not come between the<br/>tones separated by those intervals.</p><p>&gt; ...<br/>&gt;   &gt; [OY:]<br/>&gt;   &gt;   &gt; Do you think it feasible to sound a super-pythagorean C<br/>major<br/>&gt;   &gt;   within this modified 79tET that I&apos;ve been proposing?<br/>&gt;   &gt;<br/>&gt;   &gt;   By this are you referring to a triad with ratios 1/1, 9/7,<br/>3/2?  The<br/>&gt;   &gt;   79 division is not 7-limit consistent (as to 5 vs. 7) or<br/>1,3,7,9-<br/>&gt;   &gt;   consistent, for that matter.  Unless this inconsistency is<br/>something<br/>&gt;   &gt;   you&apos;ve found a way to exploit for your particular purposes, I<br/>expect<br/>&gt;   &gt;   that you&apos;ll be encountering problems with it.<br/>&gt;   &gt;<br/>&gt;   &gt;   I hope you can make an equally thorough analysis for my &grave;79<br/>MOS<br/>&gt;   out of 159tET&grave;. I don&apos;t think it is problematic in any way, do<br/>you?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;   159-ET is 17-limit consistent, so you can disregard what I said<br/>about<br/>&gt;   the 79 division.  I don&apos;t know enough about the maqamat and how<br/>&gt;   you&apos;re relating them to your MOS scale to be able to say any more<br/>&gt;   than that.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;   You will see again.</p><p>There is something that you need to see that pertains to any MOS<br/>scale, including the 79-tone MOS:  There will be very few maqams that<br/>can be transposed exactly from one starting tone to another, and<br/>certain none that can be transposed exactly by a fifth.  When you<br/>spoke of your desire for &quot;free modulation&quot;, did you mean exact<br/>transposition, or were you allowing that some of the intervals in a<br/>maqam would change slightly when the starting note is different?<br/>Only in an equal temperament can you have exact transposition to any<br/>given tone, and only if you have the capability of using any given<br/>tone of the entire ET, which would not seem to be the case with a MOS<br/>scale.</p><p>I personally cannot see why you would need to be able to transpose a<br/>maqam to 159 different tones in the octave -- you would not even be<br/>able to hear a transposition by 1deg159!  You need to answer this<br/>question: how many different tones in the octave should be able to<br/>serve as a possible starting note for maqams?</p><p>Which leads right into the next point:</p><p>&gt;   &gt; ...<br/>&gt;   &gt; [GS:]<br/>&gt;   &gt;   You expressed an interest in 31-ET, and also in flexible<br/>intonation<br/>&gt;   &gt;   and ratios of 7 (as I infer from your &quot;superpythagorean&quot;<br/>comment.<br/>&gt;   &gt;   Since 31 represents both 4:5 and 4:7 extremely well, is 11-<br/>limit<br/>&gt;   &gt;   consistent, and is also one of the very best meantones<br/>available,<br/>&gt;   &gt;   would you be interested in some sort of adaptive JI based on<br/>217-ET,<br/>&gt;   &gt;   a multiple of 31?</p><p>To rephrase my question: is 31 enough starting tones/octave?  What<br/>about two parallel chains of 19 fifths (38-ET, which could also be<br/>thought of as a single chain of hemififths)?  Each of those pitches<br/>could be supplemented by tones slightly above and below that would<br/>comprise 31 or 38 pitch clusters notated using only the<br/>Tartini/Couper symbols.  Optional diacritical marks might be used to<br/>indicate the degree and/or direction of deviation from the strict<br/>ET.  (I&apos;ll have suggestions about these, should you decide this could<br/>be useful.)</p><p>Another possibility is a circle of 53 fifths, supplemented by two<br/>other circles 1deg159 above and below that -- 53 pitch-clusters, with<br/>3 tones per cluster.  You notate 53-ET (probably *not* with the<br/>symbols in file Tplus-53.gif, since I have a variation on that idea)<br/>and optionally indicate the above- and below-tones in the cluster<br/>with a 7:5-kleisma scroll that could be affixed to the existing<br/>accidental.  (If the maqam world now recognizes the 53 division in<br/>its theory, then this will be right up their alley.)  Hang on --<br/>there&apos;s more.</p><p>For the meantone version of this, you use a chain of hemi-meantone-<br/>fifths (46deg159) at least 38 tones in length using a 38-ET notation<br/>(Tartini/Couper symbol set).  The tones 39 generators distant in the<br/>chain are 1deg159 apart, so they&apos;re pairs of a cluster, capable of<br/>being notated with the same symbol (with optional 7:5k-scroll and 17C-<br/>symbol marks ranging from +-2deg159).</p><p>This is my last &quot;latest and greatest&quot; brainstorm, but you&apos;re probably<br/>runing for shelter -- I can predict that you won&apos;t like this, because<br/>it won&apos;t notate Rast as C natural gamme on the staff.  I can<br/>appreciate that this might be important to you, but there&apos;s something<br/>else to consider.  &apos;Most everyone here believes that the most logical<br/>tuning for a scale consisting completely of the natural notes in a<br/>chain of fifths from F thru B is one in which the fifths are all the<br/>same size, and the reason for that is none other than -- ease of<br/>transposition (see below)!</p><p>&gt;   &gt; [OY:]<br/>&gt;   &gt;   Uh, I am not sure, but I can always tell a good marketing<br/>&gt;   strategy when I see one!<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;   I was just looking at the bits and pieces of phrases about which<br/>you<br/>&gt;   expressed interest -- meantone, superpythagorean (good 7th<br/>harmonic),<br/>&gt;   flexible intonation, Tartini accidentals -- and came up something<br/>&gt;   that manages to tie all of these together, with varying success.<br/>&gt;   This was just to bring up another idea that you might consider.<br/>My<br/>&gt;   thoughts about this came together before I had read and digested<br/>your<br/>&gt;   latest (about the 79-MOS), so I&apos;m having to volley them back at a<br/>&gt;   moving target. :-)<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;   I&apos;m sure my evasive manoeuvres are confusing. But I assure you,<br/>I&apos;m not running to and fro without purpose!</p><p>Hmmm, perhaps it&apos;s because I&apos;ve been shooting too many thoughts your<br/>way.  ;-)</p><p>&gt;   &gt; [GS:]<br/>&gt;   &gt;    You could use the Tartini accidentals for all of<br/>&gt;   &gt;   the pitches of 31 and perhaps supplement them with small<br/>arrows<br/>&gt;   &gt;   placed (optionally) to the left to serve as a guide (e.g., as<br/>&gt;   &gt;   something like diacritical marks for Maqam musicians in<br/>training) to<br/>&gt;   &gt;   indicate the direction and amount that the pitch should be<br/>adjusted<br/>&gt;   &gt;   (in increments of ~5.5 cents).  You might need them only<br/>rarely if<br/>&gt;   &gt;   most of the adjustments are only a single increment.  All of<br/>the<br/>&gt;   &gt;   pitches of 217-ET may be reached by adjusting the closest<br/>pitch of 31-<br/>&gt;   &gt;   ET by no more than ~17 cents (3 increments), which is still<br/>less than<br/>&gt;   &gt;   a 5-comma.<br/>&gt;   &gt;<br/>&gt;   &gt; [OY:]<br/>&gt;   &gt;   It certainly deserves attention, but is not 79 MOS out of<br/>159tET<br/>&gt;   a better, simpler alternative that encompasses both meantone and<br/>&gt;   pythagorean notations so as to express both Rast and Suz-i Dilara<br/>as<br/>&gt;   C natural gamme on the staff?</p><p>I mentioned that some of us had a difficulty with Ben Johnston&apos;s<br/>approach to notating JI.  The thing we specifically don&apos;t like about<br/>it is that not all fifths in a chain of natural notes from F to B<br/>were of the same size, so that when you transpose something from one<br/>key to another, you must introduce one or more comma-accidentals in<br/>order to keep the transposition exact, and &apos;most every time you<br/>transpose, the comma-accidentals will occur in different places, so<br/>it&apos;s not always easy to keep track of where they should go.  Your 79<br/>MOS scale also has this characteristic.</p><p>&gt;   ...  (At the moment there are too many demands on my time to<br/>&gt;   get too involved in something like this, because I know from past<br/>&gt;   experience that it will take much more of my time than I<br/>intended.  I<br/>&gt;   expected the Sagittal notation project to take several months,<br/>but<br/>&gt;   after more than 3 years it&apos;s still going ahead &quot;full steam.&quot;)<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;   It&apos;s pleasing to see that all good things don&apos;t come to an end.</p><p>On the other hand, it&apos;s frustrating to find that some good things<br/>take so long to accomplish that it seems they will never end.</p><p>I was trying to break it to you gently that it has become evident<br/>that my participation in this discussion will be requiring more of my<br/>time than I&apos;m able to spare at present.  It has come to the point<br/>where I would have to familiarize myself with some of the maqam<br/>scales in order to be able to offer an informed opinion about the<br/>suitability of a given MOS scale and suggestions regarding notation.<br/>I&apos;m currently working with Dave Keenan in a (hopefully) final effort<br/>to complete a systematic derivation, definition, and classification<br/>of at least 233 different Sagittal accidentals ranging up to an<br/>apotome in size, and that has had to be done a little at a time, when<br/>I can find a few minutes to work on it.  And after that I have some<br/>things that I have been writing and composing that await my return.<br/>My life has had more than its share of good intentions and unfinished<br/>business, and I hope to complete at least a few of those things while<br/>I still have the ability to do so.</p><p>In a perfect world we would all have unlimited time to do the things<br/>that matter most to us (and likewise to help others with theirs), but<br/>there is so much already left unfinished that I must, regretfully,<br/>take leave of this discussion -- once I&apos;ve made a few final comments.</p><p>&gt; ...<br/>&gt;   And what would 67 MOS require? Could we represent 55, 67 and 79<br/>with a single notation?</p><p>I couldn&apos;t say offhand, without delving into the details of those<br/>first two (which I&apos;m not prepared to do, for reasons I just<br/>explained).</p><p>&gt;   &gt; [OY:]<br/>&gt;   &gt;  So, will you help me notate this 79 MOS using only your<br/>wonderous<br/>&gt;   quarter-tone accidentals?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;   Please, they&apos;re Tartini&apos;s (and Mildred Couper&apos;s) accidentals, and<br/>I<br/>&gt;   don&apos;t see exactly how they would be used in this MOS.  With the<br/>&gt;   meantone fifth of 159, the apotome is 8deg, but you find the<br/>interval<br/>&gt;   of 4deg (semi-apotome) only after making a chain of 76 meantone<br/>&gt;   fourths (assuming that&apos;s an appropriate way to use the symbol).<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;   Something tells me that some symbols should be less attached to<br/>the cycle of fifths, and be taken with a grain of salt.</p><p>Huh?  Maverick symbols with an independent agenda -- to be taken less<br/>seriously?  That sounds subversive to me  ;-)  -- but  rather like<br/>what I suggested when I mentioned pitch-clusters.</p><p>&gt;    My reason for suggesting a hemi-(meantone-)fifth generator to<br/>Gene is<br/>&gt;   that it&apos;s an easy way to get the semi-apotome into the chain of<br/>&gt;   intervals, but then I haven&apos;t checked to see how many tones would<br/>be<br/>&gt;   in the MOS&apos;s of that generator.  (Not having Paul Erlich&apos;s paper<br/>&gt;   handy, I would have to guess that 76 would be among them.)<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;   And how would that help us?</p><p>I thought that It would help if you *require* that the Tartini<br/>semisharp and Couper semiflat symbols be used (but that was before I<br/>understood the exact nature of the MOS scale).  Anyway, I suspect<br/>that requirement is not at the top of your list.</p><p>&gt;   Before even beginning to address the question of notation, I<br/>think<br/>&gt;   you will need to clarify with Gene how (and whether) this MOS is<br/>&gt;   really going to live up to your expectations.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;   I believe we are making good progress already. Maybe I will call<br/>this family of MOS temperaments &quot;bi-linear MOS&quot;, because of the<br/>possibility of switching from meantone to pythagorean.</p><p>I should caution you that a few of us have been using the terms &quot;bi-<br/>linear&quot; and &quot;multi-linear&quot; for a class of tunings (having equidistant<br/>parallel lines of generators) quite different from your MOS scale (in<br/>which the two types of lines intersect), and Paul Erlich has had<br/>reservations about even that prior usage being potentially misleading.</p><p>Ozan, I hope my thoughts and ideas have been helpful.
