I&apos;ve shown, with six colors, the six<br/>transpositions of the Arabic Diatonic that can be notated without<br/>double sharps or double flats (assuming the generating fifths are 31-<br/>tET fifths). While the mapping is somewhat logical, in some places<br/>the notes are not in order of pitch . . . I&apos;d love to see suggestions<br/>for improvement.</p></div>
