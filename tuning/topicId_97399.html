It then<br/>proceeds to pick &quot;the strongest one&quot; and say that&apos;s the F0 for the<br/>signal. This is the same notion that we&apos;ve been throwing around for<br/>ages over at tuning-math, with a few twists, some better, some worse.<br/>It has apparently outperformed a whole range of both time-domain and<br/>other frequency-domain algorithms in various tests, one of which is a<br/>square-difference algorithm not too different from what Tartini is<br/>doing. There is also an algorithm called SWIPE&apos; (SWIPE-prime) that is<br/>probably even more accurate than necessary.</p><p>I highly suggest that anyone interested read this dissertation, which<br/>doesn&apos;t have all that much math and does a fantastic job at explaining<br/>all of this better than I can in very clear English. If we can<br/>implement some variant of this, perhaps with parabolic waves instead<br/>of sawtooth waves, and instead of picking &quot;the strongest F0&quot; compute<br/>an entropy, I think we&apos;ll be able to get a reasonable correlate for HE<br/>that can apply to any incoming signal.</p><p>-Mike</p></div>
