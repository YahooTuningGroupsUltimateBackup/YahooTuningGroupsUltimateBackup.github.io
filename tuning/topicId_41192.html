I think we&apos;re<br/>saying the same thing here. By my notation, a C major triad has C, Ev, and G, ie steps 0, 7 and<br/>13.  That has what I mean by a &quot;straight C&quot;, ie no arrows or other accidentals. When  I first<br/>looked at the notation I didn&apos;t like the idea of having the open strings notated as Ev etc. simply<br/>in order to have a &quot;straight&quot; C. So I transposed everything to have the open strings with no<br/>accidentals, which of course gave me a C^ for natated middle C.  Now I&apos;ve changed my mind and I<br/>think this is too guitar-centred. It &apos;s preferable to have the C (notated as middle C) on the<br/>guitar with no accidentals. That&apos;s open to debate and is merely my choice at the moment, but I<br/>agree with all you say about the comma.</p><p>&gt; &gt;Finally, I&apos;ve made a start at connecting chords concentrating on good<br/>&gt; &gt;voice leading on the guitar from various degrees of the decatonics,<br/>&gt; &gt;starting with triads, just to get a feel for the fingerings.

But by analogy with 12tet - 2 modes (major<br/>&gt; and<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;minor) starting on each of 12 tones = 24 keys, given that<br/>&gt; relative<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;maj<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;and min have the same signature. So in 22 tet 2 modes x 22 tones<br/>&gt; = 44<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;keys.<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; so that&apos;s 22 key signatures. add 11 key signatures for the<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; symmetrical modes and you have the 33 key signatures shown (on a<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; decatonic staff) in the Appendix.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; Still doesn&apos;t tally. The Pentachordals; major, minor, standard and<br/>&gt; alternate are all modes of each<br/>&gt; &gt; other. Same with the symmetricals. That makes two basic scales. On<br/>&gt; each of 22 scale steps that<br/>&gt; &gt; makes 44 possible keys.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; but the symmetricals are the same when you transpose them by a half-<br/>&gt; octave! thus there are only 11, not 22, symmetrical scale key<br/>&gt; signatures.</p><p>OK</p><p>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; I&apos;ll report back when i&apos;ve done them all. As for decatonic<br/>&gt; notation, yes<br/>&gt; &gt; it&apos;s excellent, but I&apos;ll have enough on my hands with a non-<br/>&gt; diatonic tuning and new notation.<br/>&gt; &gt; Keeping to the 5 line staff is at least one point of familiarity<br/>&gt; for musicians. As I say, it&apos;s<br/>&gt; &gt; hard enough to persuade people to look at new tunings anyway.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;Could be I&apos;m on a wild goose chase but the Standard pentachordal<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;major for example in &apos;c&apos; has three accidentals (I&apos;m using<br/>&gt; Fokker&apos;s<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;notation BTW), f sharp, b and d flat.<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; that would seem to indicate this scale:<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; C, D flat, E, F sharp, G, A, B flat (, C)<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; which in your notation would be pitches<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; 0, 1, 8, 12, 13, 17, 18 (,22)<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; Not in the notation I&apos;m using. As I said I&apos;m using Fokker&apos;s<br/>&gt; &gt;notation as suggested by Dave Keenan<br/>&gt; &gt; last year : -<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; C, C^, Db^, Dv, D, Eb, Eb^, Ev, E, F, F^, F#v, Gv, G, Ab, Ab^, Av,<br/>&gt; A, Bb, Bb^, Bv, B.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; yes, this is correct. remember, D flat is the same as C^. F sharp is<br/>&gt; the same as Gv. recall my recent reminder about chromatic and<br/>&gt; diatonic semitones. so my transcription is correct.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; while the std. pent. maj. is<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; 0, 2, 4, 7, 9, 11, 13, 16, 18 (,22)<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; so this seems way off, both in the number of pitches it indicates,<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; and which pitches it indicates.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; How so?  Tones 0, 2, 4, 7, 9, 11, 13, 16, 18 , 20, (,22) give me C,<br/>&gt; Db^, D, Ev, F, F#v,  G,  Av,<br/>&gt; &gt; Bb,  Bv, (C). That&apos;s flats on b and d and a sharp on f, as I said.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; first of all, no (see above). secondly, the key signature would leave<br/>&gt; out the Ev, Bv, and F natural.</p><p>I don&apos;t understand what you find wrong with this.

Bv is notated as is and doesn&apos;t need to be in the key signature. I know this might fly in<br/>the face of convention regarding key signatures, but I&apos;m doing this for convenience rather than<br/>conformity. You have to ask yourself at some point what your reason is for having a key signature<br/>and at the moment I think it would be useful to know that this piece begins in C standard<br/>pentachordal. When sharp and flats creep in then something has changed. These events of change<br/>will eventually become recognisable as cadences, modulations and altered chords.</p><p>&gt; this is terribly messy, and will lead<br/>&gt; to sickening complications especially for some of the more complex<br/>&gt; keys.</p><p>Not up till now.

So far the<br/>signatures seem to be quite straightforward.</p><p>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; I&apos;ve also to get used to some notational problems, one being<br/>&gt; the<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; simple<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; question of the C major triad and the notation I&apos;m using for<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; guitar.<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; Taking C as the root I should notate that as c^ if I want a<br/>&gt; 5/4<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; with &apos;e&apos;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; on the fourth string fourth fret. Then my 3/2 wth c^ is<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; notated &apos;a&apos;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; flat. I seem to remember transposing the guitar fretboard<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;notation<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; to<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; accommodate the open strings. Better change back.<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; i&apos;m not following. are you saying there&apos;s something wrong with<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; having<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; the open strings notated E A d g b&apos; e&apos;; that is, as<br/>&gt; the &quot;naturals&quot;?<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;Well there&apos;s nothing wrong but if I want the open strings strings<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;natural then &apos;c&apos; will be c^. As I&apos;m serious about writing for<br/>&gt; other<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;conventional instruments, with or without guitar I&apos;m prepared to<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;sacrifice an initial convenience on the guitar, ie &apos;natural&apos; open<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;strings, so that I can have a straight &apos;c&apos;. I don&apos;t know what<br/>&gt; your<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;thoughts are on that. I&apos;m going right back for a fresh start<br/>&gt; with 22<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;tet and as a result am trying to build a firm foundation.<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; if you want a 5-limit consonance with &apos;g&apos;, you need &apos;c&apos;. if you<br/>&gt; want<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; a 5-limit consonance with &apos;e&apos;, you need &apos;c^&apos;. so i don&apos;t know what<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; a &quot;straight &apos;c&apos;&quot; could mean. if you don&apos;t like this behavior, you<br/>&gt; can<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; try to eliminate syntonic comma &apos;kink&apos;, by changing the notation,<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; retuning the strings, etc. but you&apos;ll never get rid of it<br/>&gt; entirely --<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; you&apos;ll merely be shifting it elsewhere -- a wild goose chase<br/>&gt; perhaps.<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; if you&apos;re looking for traditional 5-limit diatonic behavior to be<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; preserved, you need to use 19, 26, or 31, etc., *not* 22.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; The &quot;22 is not a good diatonic scale&quot; message has been received<br/>&gt; loud and clear. I think we&apos;re<br/>&gt; &gt; saying the same thing here. By my notation, a C major triad has C,<br/>&gt; Ev, and G, ie steps 0, 7 and<br/>&gt; &gt; 13.
