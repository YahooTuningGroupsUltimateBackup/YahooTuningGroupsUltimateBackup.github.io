If 1-5/4-3/2-7/4 is a major tetrad in root position and 1-6/5-3/2-12/7 a minor tetrad in root position, then you can arrange them as major tetrad on 1/1, minor tetrad on 5/4 (root up a major third) major tetrad on a secor (root down 7/6) and repeat, up and down, until you reach the limits of the MOS. Adjacent tetrads share two notes and hence an interval, and movement by a step gives good voice-leading properties.</p></div><h3>Mike Battaglia &#x3C;battaglia01@...&#x3E;</h3><span>9/10/2010 4:23:02 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>On Fri, Sep 10, 2010 at 5:47 PM, genewardsmith<br/>&lt;genewardsmith@...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &quot;I just wish Icould wrap my head around what miracle -is-, rather than just a neat way to get arbitrarily close to JI.&quot;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; The secor is small, so miracle divides various 11-limit consonances into equal parts.

I just loaded up blackjack and started messing around - I get<br/>the pattern now. So the 33-cent interval functions as the chromatic<br/>interval here, even though it&apos;s so small. So the distinction between<br/>&quot;chromatic&quot; and &quot;diatonic&quot; breaks down with something like miracle,<br/>since you need to be chromatic to make consonant tetrads work at all.</p><p>As an aside, I also have a feeling that words like &quot;diatonic&quot; and<br/>&quot;chromatic&quot; are really discrete quantizations of an underlying<br/>continuous function. The same applies to &quot;chord tones,&quot; &quot;non-chord<br/>tones,&quot; &quot;avoid notes&quot; for a certain chord, etc.</p><p>-Mike</p></div>
