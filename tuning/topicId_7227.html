I heard that sound<br/>before I heard Ives. I recognized it in his music and felt like I was<br/>in on a secret.&quot;</p><p>I just sort of stumbled into this fascinating quote about Ives in an<br/>All About Jazz online interview with guitarist Joe Morris, and it is<br/>really uncanny just how similar this was to my own experiences upon<br/>first hearing Ives, and indeed is exactly why I occasionally refer to<br/>Ives as a sort of Sigurd Olson of music... I wonder how much of this<br/>(&apos;praeter naturam&apos;) resonance of Nature Ives would have been able to<br/>transfer into (or animate with) his music had it not been for the<br/>highly charged philosophic and poetic examples of Emerson and Thoreau?<br/>Impossible to say of course, but I really believe that certain things<br/>like the specific sections of the poems of Johnson and Brooke that he<br/>choose to set to music (I&apos;m thinking of the Housatonic and<br/>Grantchester) really underscore a certain sensibility or<br/>disposition... and much like Joe Morris wrote in the above quote, I<br/>too heard that sound before I heard Ives, and yet I also recognized it<br/>in his music as well...</p><p>While I&apos;ve brought up the subject of Joe Morris, I&apos;d like to add that<br/>when I was a teenager I used to go into Boston to hear the Joe Morris<br/>Trio quite a bit, and he&apos;s a wonderful guitarist well worth taking the<br/>time to check out (in fact, he and James Emery are IMO the two best<br/>representatives of modern avant-garde jazz guitar that manage to<br/>combine big chops and innovative ideas into a real integrated and<br/>immediately recognizable musical personality), he&apos;s got a really<br/>interesting sense of phrasing and time, for while his playing or lines<br/>are often very &apos;angular,&apos; his sense of time is oddly &apos;square,&apos; or<br/>&apos;flatfooted.&apos;</p><p>Joe Morris also played with (microtonalist) Joe and Mat Maneri on the<br/>ECM &quot;Three Men Walking&quot; release (in a circumstance much like the one<br/>that I pointed out occurs in HUUN-HUUR-TU&apos;s _Mezhegei_, where a<br/>standard twelve-tone guitar is coexisting within a decidedly pitch<br/>sensitive, non-12e context), however I do not believe that that<br/>recording is the best place to hear either the Maneris or Morris... It<br/>is my opinion (and especially if you&apos;ve never heard either the Maneris<br/>or Morris) that you&apos;d be much better off hearing them in the contexts<br/>of their own groups first.</p><p>Dan</p></div>
