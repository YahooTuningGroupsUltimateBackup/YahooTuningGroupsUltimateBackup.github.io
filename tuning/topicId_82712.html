Then how come virtually every scale mentioned here is diatonic-ally based and sounds either exactly the same to most people as 12TET or &quot;just slightly different&quot; (IE mean-tone)?&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp; If we&apos;re truly at 0% with our understanding of JI, how come there haven&apos;t been some radical improvements from 0% made by all the geniuses on this list who have been at this for 20+ years...or virtually anyone over the last few hundred?&nbsp;&nbsp;<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp; Ok, maybe Wilson and some of his scales truly differ from diatonic; which partly explains why he&apos;s one of my favorite micro-tonal geniuses.&nbsp; But still, the difference is far from dramatic to the average listener and I, for one, haven&apos;t gotten any 12TET listeners to count any of his scales over about 6-notes per 2/1 octave in size as &quot;consonant&quot;.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp; That&apos;s why I say we&apos;re at 98% understanding of JI...and might be better off pointing all the dramatic work that goes on here to something that is less perfectly explored.<br/>**********************************************************************&nbsp;<br/>--Right now all fails, and we make music in 12tet which apparently --approximates (atleast a subset) of how music<br/> really works.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp; I&apos;ll agree, 12TET approximates a subset.&nbsp; Then again, things like higher limit JI, apparently, very well approximate one way to make just about every possible combination of low-numbered-ratio-based scales work.&nbsp; And, if you consider both the number of ratio-based scales in history and the limits of combinatorics, you can already figure that, if you&apos;ve made a JI scale, someone has already made one VERY VERY close to it that most likely sounds VERY similar.</p><p>&nbsp; Again, we agree to disagree...and my opinion is that such huge multitudes of research have occurred around JI that it is very close to, if not already reaching, it&apos;s potential.&nbsp; If anything I&apos;d recommend helping work to make it more convenient and inviting for, say, musical instrument and software manufacturers to build JI instruments if you want to &quot;improve JI&quot;.&nbsp; Then again, people like Kraig Grady have already done (and/or are still<br/> doing...Kraig apparently invented several JI instruments including guitars) just that sort of intelligent marketting of JI over the agreeably inferior standard of 12TET.</p><p>-Michael</p><p>--- On Thu, 4/9/09, Marcel de Velde &lt;m.develde@...&gt;

Meaning, it appears we got about 96% of the way to ratio-based consonance hundreds of years ago and now more like 98% of the way with JI and Wilson&apos;s scales (which are not too far from JI themselves)?&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Can you say &quot;diminishing marginal returns&quot;?!&nbsp; I figure that we really should move our efforts to something else meaning...something that shows more potential for improvement and opening possibilities NOT already discovered through tuning geniuses hundreds of years ago.</p><p>--I<br/>suspect that you are flogging a dead horse;

If rational-number- based tuning is 98% of the way to its capability, you &quot;still&quot; have another 2% (near-dead-horse) gain possible (and enough people here smart enough to manage to squeeze that measly extra 2% juice &quot;off of the fruit of rational ratio-based tuning&quot;). :-D&nbsp;</p><p>************ ********* *<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp; But (Charles) the point I think we both agree on is this...</p><p>&nbsp; Why work so hard for a very small gain on an art-form that&apos;s been near perfect for so long (rational numbered ratio-based tuning), why not instead move on to something with something more like 40% of untouched capacity like irrational-number- generate<br/> tunings.</p><p>This is your way of looking at it.The way I see it there is only 1 way music works and music is <a href="http://constructed.As">constructed.As</a> this way is as of yet unexplained / not understood there is nothing that is &quot;98%&quot;
