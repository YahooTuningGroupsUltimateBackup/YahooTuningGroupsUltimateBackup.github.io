The history of dividing<br/>intervals into nearly equal parts is deep and<br/>complex, especially in Arabian and Persian music.<br/>Ptolemy&apos;s Even Diatonic tetrachord consists of<br/>ascending interval ratios 12/11, 11/10, 10/9. The<br/>first two may be considered, in the tradition of near-<br/>equal intervals, as &quot;neutral seconds,&quot; consisting of<br/>150.6 cents and 165.0 cents, respectively. When<br/>one traces the presence of such ratios, and the<br/>practice of near-equal division, in the writings of Al-<br/>Farabi and Ibn Sina one begins to understand the<br/>etymology of ratios.</p><p>As a designer and builder of acoustic instruments, I<br/>know that a well-designed part has at least two<br/>functions. Sometimes, it can have five or even six<br/>equally important functions. Sometimes, I discover<br/>that a part has more functions than I initially<br/>intended. It is the same with the writings of<br/>Ptolemy, Al-Farabi, and Ibn Sina. Whether or not<br/>they consciously intended or anticipated all the<br/>functions of their text is irrelevant.</p><p>The same holds true for the writers of this group.<br/>None of us can intentionally predict all the functions<br/>of our messages. However, a thread or a<br/>connection does in time eventually emerge.</p><p>Ptolemy&apos;s tetrachords are musically relevant for<br/>many reasons. As a musician, I am not in need of<br/>convincing. I am offering the concept of the<br/>etymology of ratios as another method, or another<br/>approach for reading ancient texts. The verbal<br/>language of numbers, and the verbal language of<br/>the origins of numbers, especially as exemplified in<br/>the practice of dividing canon and &grave;ud strings, is in<br/>my opinion essential to understanding not only<br/>ancient music, but modern music as well.</p><p>Cris</p><p>Thank you, Margo, for your acknowledgments.<br/>You inspired me to keep writing.</p><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;Carl Lumma&quot; &lt;carl@...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; As a student of tuning theory, I have learned much<br/>&gt; &gt; by tracing the etymology of ratios.

The only method by which an<br/>etymology of ratios can be established is by<br/>understanding the contexts from which certain<br/>ratios emerge, and thereby, the groups to which<br/>certain ratios belong.</p><p>From my text:</p><p>******************************</p><p>Section 11.66</p><p>Finally, and most importantly, Figure 11.68 verifies<br/>that the first six ascending interval ratios of Ibn<br/>Sina&apos;s Nawa in Table 11.32 are identical to the six<br/>ascending interval ratios of the modern Persian<br/>mode called Dastgah-e Nava in Table 11.34.<br/>Examine the intervals encompassed by the curly<br/>brackets in Table 11.32, and notice that these<br/>markers indicate the division of the Pythagorean<br/>&quot;minor third,&quot; interval ratio 32/27, into two near-<br/>equal &quot;neutral seconds,&quot; ratios 13/12 and 128/117.<br/>(See Figure 11.64.) Table 11.32 shows that Ibn<br/>Sina divided this &quot;minor third&quot; into two &quot;neutral<br/>seconds&quot; in four different locations on the ud:<br/>between DF, or 4/3 &div; 9/8 = 32/27; between FAb,<br/>or 128/81 &div; 4/3 = 32/27; between GBb, or 16/9 &div;<br/>3/2 = 32/27, and between C&apos;Eb&apos;, or 64/27 &div; 2/1 =<br/>32/27. Now, recall Farhat&apos;s observation that one<br/>divides this &quot;minor third&quot; so that &quot;the lower of the<br/>two [&quot;neutral seconds&quot;] tends to be the smaller&quot;<br/>In seven of Ibn Sina&apos;s 11 Melodic Modes, and in<br/>eight of the twelve modern dastgaha: Shur, Abuta,<br/>Dashti, Bayat-e Tork, Afshari, Segah, Homayun,<br/>and Nava, this division of the &quot;minor third,&quot; and the<br/>hierarchical order of the &quot;neutral seconds,&quot; defines<br/>one of the most essential melodic features of<br/>Persian music.</p><p>******************************</p><p>Section 11.62</p><p>In preparation for a discussion on Ibn Sina&apos;s 11<br/>Melodic Modes, let us first reexamine the theory<br/>and practice of near-equal divisions of intervals in<br/>the tetrachords of Ptolemy, Al-Farabi, and Ibn Sina.<br/>As discussed in Sections 10.1510.16 and 11.56,<br/>music theorists of antiquity preferred near-equal<br/>arithmetic divisions over exactly-equal geometric<br/>divisions for two reasons. (1) The musical necessity<br/>to resolve various kinds of commas by means of<br/>exact geometric divisions did not exist. (2) During a<br/>musical performance, it is extremely difficult to<br/>perceive tuning discrepancies less than 1015 &cent; on<br/>low-tension gut strings. In short, for Ptolemy, Al-<br/>Farabi, and Ibn Sina, two intervals that are<br/>mathematically different, but that sound nearly the<br/>same are for all practical purposes<br/>interchangeable. In his dissertation, Farhat<br/>observes</p><p>&quot;The difference between the two [neutral seconds],<br/>however, in a practical sense is too small and too<br/>much subject to fluctuation to warrant separate<br/>recognition of each one. [We] will therefore refer to<br/>all sizes of this interval as neutral 2nd.&quot; (Text in<br/>brackets mine.)</p><p>Obviously, music theorists of antiquity were<br/>perfectly capable of perceiving and calculating very<br/>small discrepancies between intervals. Even so,<br/>had they dwelled on such purely acoustical and<br/>mathematical minutiae, the musical art of<br/>tetrachord classification would not have developed.</p><p>In support of this interpretation of near-equal<br/>divisions, consider the next passage from the &quot;Kitab<br/>al-shifa,&quot; where Ibn Sina classifies the most<br/>important consonant intervals, and defines the<br/>limits of human aural perception and musical<br/>instrument construction with respect to very small<br/>and very large intervals</p><p>******************************</p><p>Cris</p><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, Margo Schulter &lt;mschulter@...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Cris wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;  Thank you, Margo, for your acknowledgments.<br/>&gt; &gt;  You inspired me to keep writing.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Thank you, Cris, for a great post!
