The ancient Greeks would have had no trouble<br/>&gt; &gt; defining what they are, or what it means for a number to<br/>&gt; &gt; be between 1 and 2, because they looked at the thing<br/>&gt; &gt; geometrically. They didn&apos;t have the &quot;number line&quot;,<br/>&gt; &gt; but they had its equivalent. Hence, in one sense to say<br/>&gt; &gt; that any new intervals have been concocted is wrong.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;                    Gene<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; +++++ They didn&apos;t have the whole Kyle Gann division of the<br/>&gt;       ocatave, did they?
