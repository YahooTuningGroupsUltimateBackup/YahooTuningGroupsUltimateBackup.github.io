Instead of leaving the comma-error in just one interval,<br/>it&apos;s more natural to spread it out, so that all the intervals share it and<br/>each only suffers a very small amount. And note that, according to my<br/>calculation, it&apos;s not spread equally -- the central fifths are tempered more<br/>than the outer ones. The calculation is very &quot;natural&quot; -- if you think of<br/>discordance as analogous to energy, and harmonic entropy as the interaction<br/>between two atoms as a function of distance, then what we&apos;ve done is find<br/>the minimum-energy state for a &quot;molecule&quot; of five note-&quot;atoms&quot; -- finding<br/>the minimum-energy configuration is often exactly what nature does.</p></div><h3><a id=12143 href="#12143">ðŸ”—</a>D.Stearns &#x3C;STEARNS@CAPECOD.NET&#x3E;</h3><span>8/31/2000 3:01:33 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Joseph Pehrson wrote,</p><p>&gt; Actually, I am hoping to get some sound samples up on the &quot;Tuning<br/>Lab&quot; that involve extracts of pieces in various tunings... with<br/>descriptions.</p><p>Yeah, bravo, I like this idea a lot!</p><p>Paul wrote,</p><p>&gt; Both musical directions matter to me.
