This<br/>music, and &quot;neo-Gothic&quot; styles drawing inspiration from it, invite<br/>approaches to interval aesthetics quite distinct from those of<br/>European music from the Renaissance to the Romantic era.</p><p>The historical Gothic tradition itself offers a consummate tuning<br/>system: Pythagorean tuning, or 3-limit just intonation (JI), which<br/>results in a subtle &quot;balance of power&quot; between the stable and unstable<br/>intervals and sonorities of Gothic polyphony. This system deserves<br/>attention both for its intrinsic beauty and for its historical role as<br/>the one JI system to win widespread acceptance on standard keyboard<br/>instruments.</p><p>Neo-Gothic tunings and temperaments strive to develop this historical<br/>tradition further in one of at least two directions: either the<br/>further extension of Pythagorean tuning beyond the 17 notes recognized<br/>by medieval theorists (Gb-A#); or the use for Gothic and neo-Gothic<br/>music of &quot;reverse meantone&quot; temperaments with fifths somewhat _wider_<br/>than a pure 3:2. Both approaches maintain a Pythagorean flavor while<br/>offering new types of intervals or artfully altered interval sizes,<br/>blending tradition with innovation.</p><p>Starting with Pythagorean tuning, or the almost identical 53-tone<br/>equal temperament (53-tet), the neo-Gothic spectrum moves through a<br/>universe of &quot;reverse meantone&quot; temperaments with the fifths becoming<br/>increasingly larger than pure: for example 41-tet, 29-tet, exponential<br/>meantone (see Section 2), and 17-tet. Thirds and sixths become even<br/>more active than in Pythagorean, and their resolutions to stable<br/>3-limit intervals even more economic and efficient, involving diatonic<br/>semitones increasingly smaller than the already compact Pythagorean<br/>limma at 256:243, or about 90.22 cents.</p><p>The region from around Pythagorean or 53-tet to 17-tet (with fifths<br/>about 3.93 cents wider than pure) might be considered the central or<br/>&quot;quintessential&quot; neo-Gothic zone, where (as the latter term may<br/>suggest) fifths and fourths are pure or reasonably close to pure.<br/>These 3-limit concords coexist with and provide resolutions for a<br/>kaleidoscopic variety of unstable intervals and sonorities, some<br/>approximating higher-prime ratios such as 13:11 or 17:14. While the<br/>progressions retain a Gothic logic, these sonorities add a color and<br/>flavor radically distinct from that of historical 3-limit or 5-limit<br/>European practice.</p><p>Beyond 17-tet, we enter a &quot;far neo-Gothic&quot; zone ranging out to around<br/>22-tet, where fifths and fourths are less smooth but still acceptable<br/>primary concords, especially with timbral adjustments (Darregization<br/>or Sethareanization). At 22-tet, where fifths are about 7.14 cents<br/>wide, the diatonic semitone is reduced to only 1/4-tone (~54.55<br/>cents), and we encounter a Wonderland of interval spellings and<br/>alterations -- yet standard Gothic progressions and some modern<br/>offshoots still succeed musically, and indeed delightfully.</p><p>From one viewpoint, the neo-Gothic spectrum ranging from around<br/>Pythagorean to 22-tet is a kind of mirror-reversed image of the<br/>historical European meantone spectrum from Pythagorean to 1/3-comma<br/>meantone or 19-tet (with fifths tempered in the _narrow_ direction by<br/>about 7.17 cents and 7.22 cents respectively). Thus the subtitle of<br/>this article, &quot;Meantone through a looking-glass.&quot;</p><p>-------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>2. The neo-Gothic spectrum, Blackwood&apos;s R, and exponential meantone<br/>-------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p>Neo-Gothic temperaments with fifths larger than pure may be seen (and<br/>heard) as artful variations and distortions of classic medieval<br/>Pythagorean tuning, the amount of distortion increasing as we move<br/>from 53-tet or Pythagorean to 17-tet, and from there to 22-tet.</p><p>At the outset of this exploration of the &quot;reverse meantone&quot; continuum,<br/>it would be well to distinguish between the scales themselves and the<br/>specific Gothic or neo-Gothic applications which are the focus of this<br/>article. Musicians who use 53-tet as a system of 5-limit or 7-limit<br/>rather than Pythagorean JI, or who use 22-tet for Paul Erlich&apos;s<br/>tetradic 7-limit system developed by analogy to 5-limit major/minor<br/>tonality[1], will be well aware of this distinction.</p><p>Not only our aesthetic appreciation of a scale, but our reckoning of<br/>its vital statistics, can change with musical viewpoint. From our<br/>Pythagorean perspective, 53-tet has whole-tones of 9 steps and<br/>diatonic semitones of 4 steps; in 22-tet, these intervals are 4 steps<br/>and 1 step. For a musician using 53-tet to approximate 5-limit JI, or<br/>using Erlich&apos;s tetradic 22-tet system, these basic intonational<br/>metrics can and will vary.[2]</p><p>To describe the aesthetics of neo-Gothic tunings and temperaments in a<br/>nutshell, we might focus on three main themes: (1) Pure or near-pure<br/>fifths and fourths, the prime concords; (2) Active and dynamic thirds<br/>and sixths inviting efficient resolutions to stable intervals; and (3)<br/>Large whole-tones and small diatonic semitones, facilitating<br/>expressive melody and incisive cadential action.</p><p>In medieval Pythagorean intonation, we have a classic balance between<br/>these elements; neo-Gothic temperaments with fifths wider than pure<br/>compromise the first element in order to accentuate the second and<br/>third. Unstable thirds and sixths become yet more active, and can yet<br/>more efficiently resolve to stable intervals; the contrast between<br/>large whole-tones and small semitones becomes yet greater.</p><p>Looking more closely at some specific tunings in the context of Gothic<br/>or neo-Gothic parameters of musical style may help in understanding<br/>what happens as we move along the reverse meantone continuum from<br/>Pythagorean to 22-tet.

Pythagorean intonation is a &quot;tuning&quot; in the<br/>strict sense, a JI system based on integer ratios only; 17-tet,<br/>22-tet, 39-tet, 41-tet, and 53-tet all belong to the family of equal<br/>temperaments or &quot;n-tet&apos;s.&quot; Exponential meantone, like more familiar<br/>historical meantone temperaments not based on an equal division of the<br/>octave, would be classified in some schemes as &quot;non-just, non-equal.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Exponential meantone&quot; is defined as having a ratio between its<br/>whole-tone and diatonic semitone equal to Euler&apos;s exponential _e_,<br/>~2.71828.[3] The result is a temperament with qualities somewhere<br/>between those of 29-tet and 17-tet on our chart, with the versatile<br/>46-tet providing a yet closer approximation, and 109-tet a nearly<br/>exact one.[4]</p><p>More generally, as we shall see, the ratio between whole-tone and<br/>diatonic semitone, termed &quot;R&quot; by tuning theorist and composer Easley<br/>Blackwood[5], provides one measure of the extent of the Neo-Gothic<br/>continuum and its place in the larger intonational universe. We may<br/>also express this ratio as T/S, using medieval initials for &quot;tone&quot; and<br/>&quot;semitone.&quot; For neo-Gothic tunings and temperaments, as the last<br/>column of our chart shows, R or T/S varies from around 2.25 to 4.</p><p>Taking the columns of our table from left to right, let us consider<br/>how the intonational qualities of these tunings interact with the<br/>artistic parameters of medieval or neo-medieval styles.</p><p>--------------------------------<br/>2.1.1. Smooth fifths and fourths<br/>--------------------------------</p><p>In Pythagorean tuning, fifths and fourths, the choice medieval<br/>concords rightfully having pride of place on the first column of our<br/>chart, have pure ratios of 3:2 and 4:3; in the almost identical<br/>53-tet, fifths are very slightly narrow (~0.07 cents).</p><p>As we move out along the central neo-Gothic zone through 41-tet and<br/>29-tet and exponential meantone, this ideal is rather mildly<br/>compromised; at 17-tet, fifths are about 3.93 cents wide. As we move<br/>into the far neo-Gothic zone, this compromise becomes more pronounced,<br/>with fifths at 22-tet about 7.14 cents wide.</p><p>One approach might be to compare these temperaments with historical<br/>meantones where the fifths are narrowed. With 41-tet and 29-tet, the<br/>tempering is less than in 12-tet (~1.95 cents), whose fifths are often<br/>considered &quot;near-pure&quot;; exponential meantone is comparable to<br/>1/8-comma meantone (~2.69 cents), and 17-tet to 2/11-comma meantone<br/>(~3.91 cents). Further out, 39-tet compares to something between<br/>1/4-comma (~5.38 cents) and 1/7-comma (~6.14 cents)[6], and 22-tet to<br/>1/3-comma meantone (~7.17 cents).</p><p>With neo-Gothic or reverse meantones, as with historical meantones, a<br/>bit more than 7 cents of tempering seems to mark the limit of tenable<br/>compromise for the fifths, and this constraint provides one motivation<br/>for placing the far end of our spectrum around 22-tet.[7]</p><p>To avoid confusing stylistic norms with universal values, we might add<br/>that other world musics such as as Balinese or Javanese gamelan quite<br/>pleasingly use fifths and fourths much further from 3:2 or 4:3, while<br/>musics based on 11-tet or 13-tet get along without any intervals<br/>resembling these ratios.</p><p>--------------------------------------------------<br/>2.1.2. Compatible major seconds and minor sevenths<br/>--------------------------------------------------</p><p>In addition to pure fifths and fourths, Pythagorean features pure<br/>ratios for major seconds or ninths and minor sevenths (9:8, 9:4, 16:9)<br/>with ideal ratios to form relatively concordant sonorities in<br/>combination with fifths or fourths: e.g. 4:6:9, 6:8:9, 8:9:12,<br/>9:12:16.[8] In a medieval setting, I term these combinations &quot;mildly<br/>unstable quintal/quartal sonorities&quot;; in certain neo-medieval styles,<br/>they might be treated not merely as relatively blending but as stable.</p><p>As the second column of our table shows, the variance of major seconds<br/>(and likewise of major ninths and minor sevenths) from their ideal<br/>Pythagorean ratios is equal to twice the tempering of the fifths (a<br/>relationship sometimes slightly obscured by rounding adjustments). At<br/>17-tet, this variance is around 7.85 cents; by 22-tet, it is around<br/>14.27 cents.</p><p>Although the just intonation of relatively concordant quintal/quartal<br/>sonorities is a special charm of medieval Pythagorean tuning, and<br/>these combinations are better within the quintessential neo-Gothic<br/>zone from Pythagorean to 17-tet, I agree with Paul Erlich that they<br/>remain acceptable in 22-tet[9] -- especially, I would add, with some<br/>Darregian/Setharean timbre adjustments.</p><p>-------------------------------<br/>2.1.3. Active thirds and sixths<br/>-------------------------------</p><p>In medieval Pythagorean tuning, major thirds at ~407.82 cents (81:64)<br/>and minor thirds at ~294.13 cents (32:27) have an active and unstable<br/>but relatively blending or &quot;imperfectly concordant&quot; quality; 53-tet<br/>(interpreted in a Pythagorean manner) offers almost identical ratios.<br/>Major sixths at ~905.87 cents (27:16) are regarded in the 13th century<br/>as somewhat more tense, and minor sixths at ~792.18 cents (128:81) as<br/>yet more tense, but play a vital role in cadential progressions, often<br/>expanding by contrary motion to octaves. In the 14th century, major<br/>and minor sixths gain a status as &quot;imperfect concords&quot; on par with the<br/>thirds.</p><p>To borrow the term of modern composer and theorist Ludmila Ulehla[10],<br/>these intervals act as &quot;dual-purpose&quot; sonorities (as distinguished in<br/>her terminology from stable &quot;concords&quot; or urgent &quot;discords&quot;), at once<br/>inviting directed resolutions to stable intervals and serving as<br/>moments of diverting vertical color.</p><p>As the third and fourth columns of our table show, major and minor<br/>thirds (and sixths also, their octave complements) become even more<br/>active and dynamic as we move from Pythagorean into the realm of<br/>neo-Gothic temperaments with fifths wider than pure. By 17-tet, major<br/>thirds have expanded to ~423.53 cents while minor thirds have<br/>contracted to ~282.35 cents. In 22-tet, these intervals have sizes of<br/>~436.36 cents (~9:7) and 272.72 cents (not far from 7:6).</p><p>As we move beyond Pythagorean, Darregian/Setharian timbre adjustments<br/>can help in keeping a _relatively_ blending quality for these<br/>intervals while enjoying the superefficient cadential action featured<br/>by these reverse meantone temperaments (see Section 2.1.5).</p><p>The expansion of major thirds (and sixths), and contraction of minor<br/>thirds (and sixths), may also serve as a possible constraint placing<br/>the far end of the neo-Gothic spectrum not too far from 22-tet. At<br/>this point, major and minor thirds are near 9:7 and 7:6 respectively,<br/>still quite distinct (to my ears) from narrow fourths or wide major<br/>seconds. Likewise, major sixths are near 12:7, and minor sixths near<br/>14:9.</p><p>Going well beyond 22-tet, at a fifth size of around 712 cents we would<br/>find major thirds expanding into the region near 450 cents, and minor<br/>thirds yet later contracting into the region near 250 cents, etc.,<br/>where questions of categorical ambiguity could become more<br/>important. This is by no means to suggest that such temperaments are<br/>undesirable, only to suggest that they may belong to a somewhat<br/>different realm than neo-Gothic from Pythagorean to 22-tet.[11]</p><p>--------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>2.1.4. Large whole-tones and small diatonic semitones: Blackwood&apos;s R<br/>--------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p>In Pythagorean tuning, whole-tones are a generous 9:8 (~203.91 cents),<br/>and diatonic semitones a compact 256:243 (~90.22 cents). This contrast<br/>facilitates expressive melody and efficient cadential action.</p><p>A useful measure of this contrast is the ratio between the sizes of<br/>these two intervals, T/S or Blackwood&apos;s R, about 2.26 for Pythagorean<br/>and precisely 2.25 or 9/4 for the almost identical 53-tet, where a<br/>whole-tone is equal to 9 steps and a diatonic semitone to 4 steps.</p><p>As we move into the spectrum of neo-Gothic temperaments where fifths<br/>are tempered increasingly wide of pure, the second column of our table<br/>(already met in Section 2.1.2) shows how major seconds increase in<br/>size; column 5 shows how diatonic semitones shrink even more<br/>rapidly. Column 6 follows the consequent accentuation of the contrast<br/>between these intervals as measured by T/S or R.</p><p>Note that for equal temperaments, R is given both as a decimal and as<br/>a fraction showing the number of steps for each interval, e.g. 9/4 for<br/>53-tet and 5/2 for 29-tet.</p><p>Moving from Pythagorean to 29-tet, we find that whole-tones have<br/>expanded rather moderately to ~206.90 cents while diatonic semitones<br/>have contracted to ~82.96 cents, with R increasing from ~2.26 to 2.5.<br/>In exponential meantone, these intervals are ~209.21 cents and ~76.97<br/>cents, with the defining ratio R of Euler&apos;s e, ~2.71828. At 17-tet,<br/>whole-tones and diatonic semitones are at ~211.76 cents and ~70.59<br/>cents -- 3 steps and 1 step respectively -- so that R is 3.</p><p>Travelling into the far neo-Gothic zone, we find that at 39-tet, these<br/>intervals are ~215.38 cents and ~61.54 cents, with R at 3.5; the<br/>diatonic semitone has become slightly smaller than the _chromatic_<br/>semitone of 19-tet (~63.16 cents, very close to 28:27). At 22-tet, the<br/>whole-tone has grown to ~218.18 cents and the diatonic semitone has<br/>contracted to ~54.54 cents, with R at 4. While this semitone --<br/>literally a &quot;diatonic quartertone&quot; -- may look very small on paper, I<br/>find that my ears can routinely accept it as a regular semitone.</p><p>Thus the contrast between large whole-tones and concise diatonic<br/>semitones, already a notable attraction of Pythagorean, becomes yet<br/>more accentuated as we progress along the reverse meantone spectrum:<br/>the &quot;minor semitone&quot; of 53-tet or Pythagorean (at or around 4/9-tone)<br/>shrinks to the thirdtone of 17-tet and the literal quartertone of<br/>22-tet.</p><p>This contrast, in its continuum of Neo-Gothic shades, can lend an<br/>expressive air to melodic lines and vertical progressions alike, and<br/>leads to our fifth artistic theme of efficient cadences.</p><p>---------------------------------<br/>2.1.5. Efficient cadential action<br/>---------------------------------</p><p>In Gothic music, cadential progressions are typically guided by<br/>directed resolutions from unstable intervals to stable ones by<br/>stepwise contrary motion (e.g. 2-4, 3-1, 3-5, 6-8, 7-5). In the 14th<br/>century, such resolutions where one voice moves by a whole-tone and<br/>the other by a semitone are especially favored (e.g. m3-1, M3-5, M6-8,<br/>m7-5, M2-4). Late medieval theorists tell us that the unstable<br/>interval should &quot;approach&quot; its stable goal as closely as possible,<br/>resolving with an ideally efficient motion.</p><p>This cadential aesthetic nicely fits both the melodic and vertical<br/>parameters of Pythagorean tuning. A major third at 81:64 (~407.82<br/>cents), for example, has a large size which at once lends it a degree<br/>of dynamic tension because of its acoustical complexity, and permits<br/>it to expand more economically to a stable fifth, as one voice moves<br/>by a whole-tone and the other by an incisive diatonic semitone.[12]</p><p>In neo-Gothic temperaments with fifths wider than pure, both aspects<br/>of this musical equation are further accentuated. As major thirds and<br/>sixths grow larger and larger (Section 2.1.3), they take on an even<br/>more active and dynamic quality, with this tension released by yet<br/>more efficient expansion to fifths and octaves (M3-5, M6-8) involving<br/>yet more narrow and incisive diatonic semitones (Section 2.1.4).</p><p>One measure of cadential efficiency or incisiveness is the total<br/>distance an unstable interval must expand (M3-5, M6-8, M2-4) or<br/>contract (m3-1, m7-5) in order to reach its stable goal. Since in<br/>these &quot;closest approach&quot; progressions one voice moves by a whole-tone<br/>and the other by a diatonic semitone -- whose sum is a minor third --<br/>this distance will be equal to a minor third.</p><p>Thus column 4 of our table, showing the size of a minor third, can<br/>also serve as an index of cadential efficiency; as this size gets<br/>smaller, cadences become more efficient, involving smaller and more<br/>incisive semitonal motions (column 5).</p><p>In Pythagorean tuning, our &quot;closest approach&quot; progressions are already<br/>admirably efficient, involving only ~294.13 cents of expansion or<br/>contraction (the size of a 32:27 minor third). By 17-tet, it has<br/>decreased to ~282.35 cents, and by 22-tet to ~272.72 cents. This trend<br/>correlates intimately with the shrinking of the diatonic semitone from<br/>~90.22 cents in Pythagorean to ~54.55 cents in 22-tet.[13]</p><p>The &quot;closest approach&quot; aesthetic, as realized by medieval Pythagorean<br/>tuning, may combine the satisfying contrast between a tense interval<br/>and its stable resolution; the release of this tension through<br/>economically directed motion; and the melodic as well as vertical<br/>appeal of concise cadential semitones. Neo-Gothic temperaments with<br/>fifths larger than pure offer accentuated variations on these themes<br/>in assorted shades of intonational Mannerism.</p><p>---------------<br/>Notes to Part 1<br/>---------------</p><p>1.

From a 5-limit JI perspective, 53-tet would mix large whole-tones<br/>of 9 steps (~203.77 cents, ~9:8) and small-whole tones of 8 steps<br/>(~181.13 cents, ~10:9), with usual diatonic semitones of 5 steps<br/>(~113.21 cents), quite close to 16:15 -- an interval which in<br/>Pythagorean terms closely approximates the _chromatic_ semitone or<br/>apotome at 2187:2048 (~113.69 cents). In Erlich&apos;s 22-tet system, see<br/>n. 1 above, pp. 22-25, a &quot;large&quot; interval (L) is equal to 3 steps<br/>(~163.64 cents), and a &quot;small&quot; interval (s) to 2 steps (~109.09<br/>cents); from a Pythagorean viewpoint, 3 steps is a chromatic semitone,<br/>and 2 steps a curious &quot;intermediate semitone&quot; between this and the<br/>diatonic semitone of 1 step.</p><p>3. This temperament, with fifths about 2.65 cents wider than pure,<br/>might be taken as a kind of neo-Gothic counterpart to the &quot;Golden<br/>Meantone&quot; developed by Thorvald Kornerup and advocated by Jacques<br/>Dudon, where this same ratio is equal to the golden mean, ~1.61834<br/>(and fifths are about 5.74 cents narrow). The latter temperament is<br/>about midway between 1/4-comma meantone (~5.38 cents, major thirds<br/>pure) and Zarlino&apos;s 2/7-comma meantone (~6.14 cents, major and minor<br/>thirds equally impure).</p><p>4. Emphasizing that the table represents an arbitrary sample of<br/>tunings and temperaments at a few points on the neo-Gothic spectrum,<br/>I might out of psychological curiosity note my selection of 17-tet,<br/>29-tet, 41-tet, and 53-tet -- possibly because Pythagorean tunings of<br/>17, 29, 41, and 53 notes represent &quot;Moments of Symmetry&quot; as described<br/>by theorist Ervin Wilson. As for 39-tet, it is the one equal<br/>temperament with 53 or fewer notes having a ratio of whole-tone to<br/>diatonic semitone (T/S, or Blackwood&apos;s R, see text below and n. 5)<br/>greater than 3 but less than 4. The purpose for including exponential<br/>meantone is, of course, unabashed promotion. Equally meritorious<br/>temperaments such as 46-tet might just as well have been included.</p><p>5. Easley Blackwood, _The Structure of Recognizable Diatonic Tunings_<br/>(Princeton: Princeton University Press, 1985).</p><p>6. As it happens, 39-tet involves almost exactly the same amount of<br/>tempering in the wide direction as Golden Meantone (see n. 3) in the<br/>narrow direction.</p><p>7. While &quot;mirror-image&quot; comparisons can be engaging, there is an<br/>important artistic asymmetry. In historical meantones, fifths are<br/>compromised (in the narrow direction) in order to optimize thirds and<br/>sixths, the primary Renaissance-Romantic concords. In Gothic or<br/>neo-Gothic music, where fifths and fourths are the primary concords<br/>and pure Pythagorean intonation provides a superb solution (except for<br/>special &quot;neo-medieval&quot; styles where circularity might be sought in<br/>less the 53 notes), temperament is more of an artistic liberty, and<br/>indeed an artful Manneristic distortion. To tune 19-tet for 5-limit<br/>music may be motivated in good part by a desire to optimize overall<br/>consonance; to tune 22-tet for Neo-Gothic music is likely more an<br/>expression of calculated xenharmonic zest.</p><p>8. Examples of these medieval sonorities, using a MIDI-style notation<br/>where C4 indicates middle C and higher note numbers show higher<br/>octaves, would be C3-G3-D4 (M9 + 5 + 5); C3-F3-G3 (5 + 4 + M2);<br/>C3-D3-G3 (5 + 4 + M2); and C3-F3-Bb3 (m7 + 4 + 4).</p><p>9. Erlich, see n. 1 above, p. 26 and n. 31. Erlich&apos;s 22-tet sonorities<br/>forming &quot;the decatonic equivalent of &apos;quartal&apos; or &apos;quintal&apos; harmony,&quot;<br/>ibid. n. 31, involve four notes, e.g., in a conventional Pythagorean<br/>spelling, C3-F3-G3-Bb3 or C3-D3-G3-A3. However, I find typical Gothic<br/>quintal/quartal sonorities of the kind we have been discussing with<br/>three notes and intervals (see n. 8 for examples) to be also<br/>satisfactory, at least in apt timbres.</p><p>10. Ludmila Ulehla, _Contemporary Harmony: Romanticism through the<br/>Twelve-Tone Row_ (New York, 1966), p. 428.</p><p>11. In practice, the limit of acceptable temperament for fifths and<br/>fourths (especially in styles where they are the main concords) may<br/>take priority as a constraining factor, and this limit is arguably<br/>reached around 22-tet. With gamelan-like timbres, however, some<br/>experiments exploring and possibiy circumventing such constraints<br/>might be very interesting. See also n. 17 below on the sizes of major<br/>thirds and diatonic semitones in tunings with fifths ranging from 710<br/>to 715 cents.</p><p>12.

Stanley Sadie, Washington, DC: Grove&apos;s Dictionaries of Music<br/>(1980), ISBN 0333231112.</p><p>13. Since &quot;closest approach&quot; progressions involve motion of a<br/>whole-tone in one voice and a semitone in the other, the expansion of<br/>the major second from Pythagorean to 22-tet by ~14.27 cents (Section<br/>2.1.2, column 2 of table) partially offsets the shrinking of the<br/>diatonic semitone by ~35.68 cents, resulting in a net gain in<br/>efficiency of ~21.41 cents. Increasing the size of the fifth produces<br/>a twofold expansion of the major second (formed from two fifths up<br/>minus an octave) but a fivefold reduction of the diatonic semitone<br/>(formed from five fifths down).</p><p>Most respectfully,</p><p>Margo Schulter<br/><a href="mailto:mschulter@value.net">mschulter@value.net</a></p></div>
