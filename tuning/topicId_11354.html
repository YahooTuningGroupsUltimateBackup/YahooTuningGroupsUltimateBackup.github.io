If I had access<br/>to a wide bandwidth relay (another server willing to take my feed and<br/>rebroadcast it) this would not be a problem, and Icecast does have an<br/>option to take care of that.<br/>&#x9;I am glad someone has been able to hear the<br/>broadcast--I have noticed an increase of traffic on this subnet during the<br/>days and especially on the weekend that causes the stream to break up.<br/>Late night and weekdays it is pretty constant. Also, for some reason<br/>Winamp and RealPlayer time out often, but xmms (Linux mp3 player) keeps on<br/>rocking.<br/>&#x9;Thanks for the suggestions, but with my setup, I am afraid I am<br/>stuck. This is really just something I wanted to test, and it works except<br/>for the bandwidth problem. But still, it shows that anyone with a DSL line<br/>and a computer can do rudimentary broadcasting. I am going to keep this<br/>current show going as long as I can, or until someone sends me a CD full<br/>of new music.</p><p>John Starrett<br/>&quot;We have nothing to fear but the scary stuff.&quot;<br/><a href="http://www-math.cudenver.edu/~jstarret/microtone.html">http://www-math.cudenver.edu/~jstarret/microtone.html</a></p></div>
