And it was only an example, as I<br/>occasionally through out, of how it is really *that much more satisfying*.</p><p>Occasionally.<br/>Doesn&apos;t have to be every posting.<br/>Or every week or month, even.</p><p>I frankly find *all* of the material worthwhile even when it isn&apos;t<br/>something I happen to center around. I couldn&apos;t give a flying truck about<br/>Periodicity Blocks, but other on the list do, and that - frankly - is what<br/>the list is for: matters related to alternate tunings.</p><p>Some other points:</p><p>~~ Paul, I&apos;ve never seen a more plainly written and personal statement from<br/>you, on your music-making. It should be clear evidence of your willingness<br/>to take the numbers into sound and form. All I hope for you is that you<br/>find both courage and conviction to move into non-12tet on a more regular<br/>basis, if only for the fact that the more of it you do the better it will<br/>become and the more worlds you&apos;ll explore (and maybe we&apos;ll get to share).<br/>And as you (Paul) said:</p><p> &gt;I&apos;m here to share and to learn.</p><p>  Not that I always<br/> &gt;know the truth, or am always right, but I&apos;ve thought and listened hard and<br/> &gt;read widely on this stuff and sometimes I will have knowledge or a point of<br/> &gt;view to share. I&apos;m here to share and to learn.</p><p>~~ To someone, somewhere, in some indigenous intonation, 12tet is an<br/>alternate tuning; I refuse to look down on someone because they play music<br/>in 12tet. Hell, that&apos;s where I make the bulk of my living, putting on the<br/>&quot;tight coat and tight shoes&quot; of the orchestral world. The only quibble I<br/>would have would be for that same person to completely dis some *other*<br/>tuning -- they all have value, somewhere, sometime.</p><p>For those of us on the list, please keep in mind that email is<br/>excruciatingly bad at communicating tone of voice, inflection of phrases.<br/>Try not to take each comment as the end of the world, and for godesses&apos;<br/>sake, if someone asks for clarification give it, don&apos;t just write them off.<br/>This is an area that I think Paul has made progress on, as well as myself.<br/>If a comment is truly personal in nature, take it off list; everyone&apos;s<br/>address is right there in the headers, and we don&apos;t need more bandwidth<br/>wasted on personal attacks. Tuning, numbers, music. And one other thing<br/>Paul said:</p><p> &gt;Sometimes I am argumentative or harsh but I believe that the truth<br/> &gt;will ultimately be more beneficial than misconceptions.</p><p>Truth is good, truth is best, but both facts and opinions can be phrased in<br/>collegial and constructive ways. You *do* have enough time in the day to be<br/>civil. As does every person on this list.</p><p>~~ Don&apos;t expect every question to receive an answer, at least right away:<br/>there may only be a few others on that topic and they might be away. And,<br/>for some of us that are more into music making than music theoretics, there<br/>is nothing breaking our collective arms and keeping us from posting on<br/>other topics. If the bulk of the postings are on diagrams and matrices,<br/>then it is because that is what people are posting about, while others sit<br/>on their hands.</p><p>~~ Oh, shit, that&apos;s enough from me. I felt duty-bound since I started this<br/>thread to respond in some manner -- it just had to come after a new hard<br/>disk install! Let&apos;s keep this an open forum, with lots of information<br/>floating around, treat everyone with respect (both as humans and<br/>colleagues), and return to the topic<br/>of ...</p><p>... what?</p><p>Behave, everyone, or I won&apos;t tell you about the Harry Partch t-shirts I<br/>have for sale (again)......</p><p>Love,<br/>Jon<br/>&grave;&apos;&grave;&apos;&grave;&apos;&grave;&apos;&grave;&apos;&grave;&apos;&grave;&apos;&grave;&apos;&grave;&apos;&grave;&apos;&grave;&apos;&grave;&apos;&grave;&apos;&grave;&apos;&grave;&apos;&grave;&apos;&grave;&apos;&grave;&apos;&grave;&apos;&grave;&apos;&grave;&apos;&grave;&apos;&grave;&apos;&grave;&apos;&grave;&apos;&grave;&apos;&grave;&apos;&grave;&apos;&grave;&apos;&grave;&apos;&grave;&apos;&grave;&apos;&grave;&apos;&grave;<br/>    Jonathan M.
