Also there&apos;s no Midi In.<br/>So you are limited to single notes played from the mouse, or pre-defined chords.</p><p>It&apos;s all based on the idea of the visitor interacting with the 3D scene<br/>using a mouse, or possibly a data glove, with the keyboard used as an<br/>auxilliary aid for navigating the scene.</p><p>Also you can&apos;t play individual midi events, just complete midi clips.</p><p>Cortona license the SDK for their plug in so possibly one<br/>could use it to make something more flexible for microtonal<br/>music, based on a VRML model but with maybe an extension of<br/>the scripting capabilities to let one play midi events, or<br/>something of that ilk. Depends how easily cusomisable thier<br/>SDK is - I&apos;m very impressed by the quality of the programming<br/>of their VRML PAD which I use all the time now that Im working<br/>on VRML again.</p><p>Alternatively, if Virtual Flower displays the lattices itself,<br/>it could work in consort with FTS to play the notes<br/>(probably better than to add a midi GUI to VF)</p><p>Anyway, can be done, and probably just a matter of time before<br/>someone does it. Meanwhile I can make a start on it by<br/>doing whichever things can be done easily and well in VRML<br/>2.0, as it is, first.</p><p>Idea that I&apos;m mulling over at present is to just join the lattice<br/>points with cylinders coloured according to the direction so you<br/>have one colour for each lattice vector as for David&apos;s method,<br/>and then those could play diads. For triads, filling in the faces<br/>would mean you can only see the nearest ones to click on, but<br/>with a script node you could maybe do it so that if you<br/>click on a diad and then an adjacent single note while it<br/>is still playing it plays the triad - or something.</p><p>I&apos;ve released virtual flower at<br/><a href="http://virtualflower.co.uk">http://virtualflower.co.uk</a></p><p>but nothing particularly microtonal about it yet, except for the screen<br/>saver which can play any audio clips one likes to accompany the scenes<br/>and comes with FTS fractal tunes by way of examples.</p><p>Does have some nice mathematical object construction things<br/>- go to Flowers Etc. | 3D Flowers and select the mathematical<br/>shapes from the drop list and you can select from teh platonic<br/>solids and truncate them, connect the edge mid points or face<br/>centres, and make them into geodesic spheres. Then use<br/>the option to make a single object tree. Then you can show them<br/>all as anaglyphs.</p><p>Also can already make the lattices from Output | select Lattice<br/>from the drop list - but with no music yet.</p><p>Another thing I plan to add is an option to make my dekany and<br/>hexany etc. models from teh templates - just get VF to do the<br/>search and replace - you enter a list of factors to use.<br/>That is certainly possible and very easy to implement.<br/>Just select them from a drop list and click a button to<br/>make the model. I&apos;ll do it so VF starts up FTS if it<br/>isn&apos;t running, and you can use FTS to choose the midi<br/>instrument to play and pitch, or maybe that much<br/>of it could be done in VF too in which case one wouldn&apos;t<br/>even need to show FTS to make the clips, just run it<br/>in the background. Needs a little more programming in<br/>FTS first.</p><p>Anyway I&apos;ll let you all here know when there is something<br/>of microtonal interest developed. Does have the<br/>screen saver already.</p><p>As a very new first release it may well still have<br/>significant bugs at this point.</p><p>Robert</p></div>
