On the Partch lattice,<br/>there are two &apos;octave&apos; ratios plotted: a pair of<br/>4/3s and a pair of 3/2s.  They appear on the central<br/>&apos;spine&apos; of the lattice.  I should have connected them,<br/>but I haven&apos;t yet.</p><p>They are about 1/4-inch apart on my screen.  So that<br/>entire 12-eq &apos;octave&apos; that&apos;s plotted on that lattice<br/>would fit into that little 1/4-inch space on the Partch<br/>lattice.</p><p>I say at the end of that page that I&apos;m not entirely<br/>happy with how this turned out.  But it&apos;s the first<br/>time I&apos;ve been able to plot ETs and a 2-axis according<br/>to a formula that works for the other primes.</p><p>&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt; There&apos;s an example of my new 11-limit tonality diamond<br/>&gt;&gt; representation at:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; <a href="http://www.ixpres.com/interval/monzo/lattices/xl/partch11.htm">http://www.ixpres.com/interval/monzo/lattices/xl/partch11.htm</a><br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Here&apos;s some comments on this page:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt; Meantones can also be viewed as a fractional division of<br/>&gt;&gt; the 1:5 ratio.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Though the fifths in meantone can, the fourths (for example)<br/>&gt; can&apos;t. So this is not correct.</p><p>I realized re-reading the webpage last night that this<br/>was not really clear the way I wrote it, so before I saw<br/>this I had revised it, adding a remark that 5^(1/4) is a<br/>1/4-comma meantone &apos;5th&apos;.  Perhaps I&apos;ll emend it again.</p><p>&gt;&gt; and it&apos;s not as attractive as my paper copy, where I used<br/>&gt;&gt; solid vectors for the otonal connections and used dashed<br/>&gt;&gt; lines for the utonal, as did Partch on his diamond.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; What do you mean?

This is exactly<br/>what you and Carl were just talking about in regard<br/>to Ming&apos;s lattice applet and the Partch diamond (not doing).</p><p>Wilson&apos;s designs incorporate maximum combinatoriality<br/>of pitch-classes within a given lattice-block.<br/>I don&apos;t know if it&apos;s a periodicity block - I haven&apos;t<br/>studied his work enough yet.</p><p>So anyway, with the exception of those few connections<br/>like 3/2 and 4/3, which have to &apos;go both ways&apos;,<br/>the vectors are either solid or dashed.  This makes<br/>the lattice look quite different, even tho the linearity<br/>itself is the same.
