I&apos;m concentrating on intonation with the Community choir who are all beginners or<br/>enlightened amateurs. Ironically it&apos;s with them that I have the greatest chance of exploring<br/>intonation. I know of nobody in Scotland dealing with JI seriously, bar yours truly, so I can see<br/>your point.  I work with two well trained (in the conventional sense) singers in my Early Music<br/>Trio and rather suspect that given time and direction that they could deliver the goods, ie.,<br/>perform my music. It&apos;s a question of attitude. Your &quot; just any old well-trained singer &quot; as you so<br/>aptly put it includes the usual rake of aspiring prima donnas who are terrified of approaching JI.<br/>But I have to think positively about the potential for change. It WILL be done.</p><p>We are quite an affluent nation as regards the arts and funding is available for new music<br/>projects. I have a few plans up my sleeve. These involve the usual string pulling act. My theory<br/>is that if they are paid well enough the singers will put in the necessary work. One thing that<br/>many well trained singers do have is discipline.</p><p>&gt; Not making a judgment or any assumptions. Just curious to know what<br/>&gt; your practical conditions and assumptions are. Most of the &quot;well-<br/>&gt; trained&quot; singers I&apos;ve run into in my life (many, many, meaning<br/>&gt; professional or semi-professional with years of vocal study) make<br/>&gt; frequent pitch errors in the range of 15-25 cents from just<br/>&gt; intervals. Of course, 15 cents is pretty normal on the sharp side for<br/>&gt; thirds in 12-tET, but even variations from 12-tET accompaniments are<br/>&gt; often in the 15-25 cent range.</p><p>In my Early Music work; French, English and Scottish Renaissance song with a soprano,<br/>counter-tenor and me on lute (12tet) taking the lower voices, the settings are very lean and<br/>sparse. It exposes the singers and encourages good intonation. The counter-tenor has expressed an<br/>interest in me using my home made bowed psaltery to accompany some of our repertoire. So I&apos;ll<br/>probably use some form of meantone or Pythagorean tuning and try to influence the voices in that<br/>way.</p><p>&gt; Just listen to professionals in typical classical recordings and<br/>&gt; you&apos;ll get an earful of errors at this order of magnitude if their<br/>&gt; vibratos are not so wide they eliminate the possibility for an<br/>&gt; accurate judgment. These latter singers don&apos;t even count. They<br/>&gt; usually do it, whether consciously or not, to cover up their aural<br/>&gt; incompetence.

When you say well-trained, do you mean well-<br/>&gt; &gt; trained in JI or just well-trained singers in the conventional<br/>sense<br/>&gt; &gt; of the term? I&apos;m a singer, so this terminology raises my eyebrow a<br/>&gt; &gt; bit if the assumption is that just any old well-trained singer<br/>will<br/>&gt; &gt; perform with this kind of intonational precision. If this is what<br/>you<br/>&gt; &gt; mean, I wouldn&apos;t bet the flea on my left ear that you&apos;re going to<br/>get<br/>&gt; &gt; what you want.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I too sing and I direct two choirs, a church choir and a Community<br/>group, so I know a little of<br/>&gt; the problem. I&apos;m concentrating on intonation with the Community<br/>choir who are all beginners or<br/>&gt; enlightened amateurs. Ironically it&apos;s with them that I have the<br/>greatest chance of exploring<br/>&gt; intonation. I know of nobody in Scotland dealing with JI seriously,<br/>bar yours truly, so I can see<br/>&gt; your point.  I work with two well trained (in the conventional<br/>sense) singers in my Early Music<br/>&gt; Trio and rather suspect that given time and direction that they<br/>could deliver the goods, ie.,<br/>&gt; perform my music. It&apos;s a question of attitude. Your &quot; just any old<br/>well-trained singer &quot; as you so<br/>&gt; aptly put it includes the usual rake of aspiring prima donnas who<br/>are terrified of approaching JI.<br/>&gt; But I have to think positively about the potential for change. It<br/>WILL be done.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; We are quite an affluent nation as regards the arts and funding is<br/>available for new music<br/>&gt; projects. I have a few plans up my sleeve. These involve the usual<br/>string pulling act. My theory<br/>&gt; is that if they are paid well enough the singers will put in the<br/>necessary work. One thing that<br/>&gt; many well trained singers do have is discipline.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; Not making a judgment or any assumptions. Just curious to know<br/>what<br/>&gt; &gt; your practical conditions and assumptions are. Most of the &quot;well-<br/>&gt; &gt; trained&quot; singers I&apos;ve run into in my life (many, many, meaning<br/>&gt; &gt; professional or semi-professional with years of vocal study) make<br/>&gt; &gt; frequent pitch errors in the range of 15-25 cents from just<br/>&gt; &gt; intervals. Of course, 15 cents is pretty normal on the sharp side<br/>for<br/>&gt; &gt; thirds in 12-tET, but even variations from 12-tET accompaniments<br/>are<br/>&gt; &gt; often in the 15-25 cent range.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; In my Early Music work; French, English and Scottish Renaissance<br/>song with a soprano,<br/>&gt; counter-tenor and me on lute (12tet) taking the lower voices, the<br/>settings are very lean and<br/>&gt; sparse. It exposes the singers and encourages good intonation. The<br/>counter-tenor has expressed an<br/>&gt; interest in me using my home made bowed psaltery to accompany some<br/>of our repertoire. So I&apos;ll<br/>&gt; probably use some form of meantone or Pythagorean tuning and try to<br/>influence the voices in that<br/>&gt; way.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; Just listen to professionals in typical classical recordings and<br/>&gt; &gt; you&apos;ll get an earful of errors at this order of magnitude if their<br/>&gt; &gt; vibratos are not so wide they eliminate the possibility for an<br/>&gt; &gt; accurate judgment. These latter singers don&apos;t even count. They<br/>&gt; &gt; usually do it, whether consciously or not, to cover up their aural<br/>&gt; &gt; incompetence. I never cease to be amazed at how high their careers<br/>&gt; &gt; can climb, though.

And I like blues singers etc...<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Bob Valentine</p><p>Bob Wendell:<br/>First, true &quot;bel canto&quot; does not have a big vibrato. At the height of<br/>the bel canto era when Monteverdi and Caccini were in business,<br/>vibrato was used conservatively. The singers of that era were<br/>possessed of incredible power, range, and virtuosic skill, typically<br/>improvising and/or reading ornamentation that few singers today can<br/>even begin to emulate properly (although some few specialists still<br/>exist who can) and which would be reserved for coloratura sopranos<br/>today instead of the baritone and tenor parts for which they were<br/>also written.</p><p>Very few who sing opera and other classical genres today know<br/>much about bel canto. As John de Laubenfels mentioned in an<br/>offline message to me, his wife also studied bel canto with great<br/>benefit. Yet she has run into vocal professors who argue that bel<br/>canto doesn&apos;t exist, as if it were &quot;some kind of long-lost ninja<br/>technique in the martial arts&quot; as he put it.</p><p>This is all too typical. I had the good fortune to study under one of<br/>the greatest masters of bel canto in the 20th century when he was a<br/>visiting professor of vocal pedagogy at New England Conservatory from<br/>the Zagreb Academy of Music under invitation by then-president<br/>Gunther Schuller. Many of the other vocal professors considered him<br/>&quot;old fashioned&quot; and basically ignored him. Unbelievably stupid! They<br/>couldn&apos;t begin to touch his level of competence in the vocal arts,<br/>and in my view, this is how they managed their relative incompetence<br/>to keep themselves comfortable. (Remember Mozart.)</p><p>Of course, bel canto means literally &quot;beautiful singing&quot;, and in our<br/>pop and folk cultures, there is often no premium whatsoever placed<br/>on beautiful singing. So many people grow up being embarassed by the<br/>beautiful singing of people like Dietrich Fischer-Diskau simply<br/>because it&apos;s alien to their cultural conditioning.</p><p>If this is what you want to banish, you should be locked in a lovely<br/>room with the likes of Fischer-Diskau, Hermann Prey, etc. until your<br/>ears get fixed and you actually start to hear the profound beauty of<br/>their voices and what they do with them.</p></div><h3><a id=29391 href="#29391">ðŸ”—</a>Paul Erlich &#x3C;paul@stretch-music.com&#x3E;</h3><span>10/22/2001 1:18:37 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In tuning@y..., Alison Monteith &lt;alison.monteith3@w...&gt; wrote:</p><p>&gt; Yes, the mini-bridges are movable.
