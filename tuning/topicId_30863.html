In a great<br/>performance (even in just a pretty good performance), chorus, audience<br/>  and music can all seem connected in the glow of humanity.<br/>       The performance Thursday night that Andrew Parrott, the noted<br/>British specialist in period practice, conducted with the Philharmonia<br/>  Baroque at the Irvine Barclay Theatre took none of this for granted,<br/>however. Parrott&apos;s historical research has convinced him that the<br/>  essence of the B-Minor Mass is not where we have always found it, in<br/>the communal power of inspiring music sung by massed voices.<br/>  Bach, he suggests, had a single singer to a part, the choral sections<br/>assumed by the same singers who handled the solos.<br/>       Indeed, Parrott explained in a lecture before the performance how<br/>he was put off by the overly pious British choral tradition that<br/>  characterized the performances of the B-Minor Mass he heard as a boy.<br/>And that is something he has now expunged with a vengeance as<br/>  he has attempted to return the Mass to something closer to what he<br/>suspects Bach originally had in mind.<br/>       Parrott&apos;s B-Minor Mass makes a radically different impression<br/>than it does even in the hands of other historically minded performers.<br/>For<br/>  one thing, this was the most modern-sounding performance of the piece<br/>I have ever heard. Whatever history tells us, our ears heard<br/>  something not old but new Thursday night, a familiar piece taken out<br/>of the context of its own performance history (it was never performed in</p><p>  Bach&apos;s lifetime) and now presented in an entirely fresh and new<br/>manner.<br/>       Parrott&apos;s version, in fact, strikes the modern ear as essentially<br/>Postmodern--Bach deconstructed. Hearing a choral work sung one to the<br/>  part, we first notice what is missing. The flesh has been removed and<br/>the structure revealed. Gone, too, are the comfort and safety of<br/>  numbers, replaced by individuals dangerously exposed.<br/>       That danger seemed to be just what Parrott thrived on most. He<br/>goaded his performers with no more mercy than a Marine sergeant.<br/>  Tempos verged on the impossibly fast. More than once, one sat on the<br/>seat&apos;s edge nervously thrilled, worried about a rhythmic train wreck. It</p><p>  wasn&apos;t just the soloists, but also the members of the orchestra who<br/>were brought to the brink of performability by incautious tempos. But<br/>  that also made heroes out of the concertmaster, solo trumpet and horn<br/>and two beguiling oboe d&apos;amore players.<br/>       The five solo singers--sopranos Barbara Borden and Ellen Hargis,<br/>mezzo-soprano Jennifer Lane, tenor Marc Molomot and bass Curtis<br/>  Streetman--were riveting. Parrott pushed them to their limits, and in<br/>so doing, they became dramatic characters in their own right.<br/>       Placing such demands on the soloists, however, would have made it<br/>impossible for them to maintain this incendiary tension throughout<br/>  the nearly two-hour piece, so Parrott had a small chorus of 10, five<br/>on either side of the stage, to periodically spell the soloists. The<br/>ancillary<br/>  singers became a rudimentary chorus and proved a pleasure.<br/>       Ultimately, Parrott&apos;s performance was as much about the conductor<br/>as it was about Bach and his time. Parrott, who has an emotional<br/>  style of waving his hands about, becomes very excited by the inner<br/>dynamics of this music, and he has the knack to make that excitement<br/>  visceral in performance. Still, I wonder how much that has to do with<br/>actually taking us back to Bach.<br/>       At this performance, my impression was not unlike the one I get<br/>these days when I walk by the construction site of the Disney Concert<br/>  Hall, peering up at the complex steel skeleton and watching the<br/>metallic skin go on. I am thrilled by what I see and muse about what it<br/>will<br/>  be like when it&apos;s fleshed out.<br/>       Likewise, by capturing the structural drama of the B Minor,<br/>Parrott&apos;s performance proved an excellent occasion to begin musing about</p><p>  fleshing out the Mass as a stage work, which is exactly what Los<br/>Angeles Opera will do in two months&apos; time. The controversy has just<br/>  begun.</p><p>  Copyright 2001 Los Angeles Times</p></div><h3><a id=30864 href="#30864">ðŸ”—</a>Afmmjr@aol.com</h3><span>12/1/2001 10:23:09 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>In a message dated 12/1/01 12:33:34 PM Eastern Standard Time,<br/><a href="mailto:ricktagawa@earthlink.net">ricktagawa@earthlink.net</a> writes:</p><p>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; <a href="http://www.calendarlive.com/top/1,1419,L-LATimes-Calendar-X!ArticleDetail-47696,00.html">http://www.calendarlive.com/top/1,1419,L-LATimes-Calendar-X!ArticleDetail-47696,00.html</a><br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;</p><p>Thanks, Rick.  I&apos;m sure it was a great performance, especially because of how<br/>the review was written.  Mark Swed seemed to be waiting for a failure that<br/>never occurred.   When a reviewer has a predetermined view it usually colors<br/>his perception, and veritably dictates the review.  This seems a good bit.<br/>Mr. Swed called me from L.A. just before my Charles Ives premiere to ask me<br/>why I bothered.  He said it&apos;s already been done.  I explained that it was a<br/>completely different work and he seemed to be increasingly disappointed.</p><p>Re Bach performance: if Parrott had tuned to Werckmeister chromatic then the<br/>tempi would no doubt be slower.  It is a correspondent factor to the<br/>tuning...there is more to listen for, phrasing takes on more breath of space.</p><p>Best, Johnny Reinhard</p></div><h3><a id=30870 href="#30870">ðŸ”—</a>Kraig Grady &#x3C;kraiggrady@anaphoria.com&#x3E;</h3><span>12/1/2001 4:18:53 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Johnny!<br/>    i believe your statement here is actually more far reaching. Many<br/>tunings encompass acoustical phenomenon that requires slower moving<br/>parts. When the phenomenon reaches great proportions then one tends to<br/>stop all moment altogether. Still there are all types of degrees<br/>in-between these two extremes. It is something i see in those beginning<br/>is that many of the old tempos and patterns don&apos;t work well or often<br/>they will pass through a chord that just cries to sustain even a beat or<br/>two longer. When one changes tuning, one has to change many perimeters.</p><p><a href="mailto:Afmmjr@aol.com">Afmmjr@aol.com</a> wrote:</p><p>&gt;  It is a correspondent factor to the tuning...there is more to listen<br/>&gt; for, phrasing takes on more breath of space.</p><p>-- Kraig Grady<br/>North American Embassy of Anaphoria island<br/> <a href="http://www.anaphoria.com">http://www.anaphoria.com</a></p><p>The Wandering Medicine Show<br/>Wed. 8-9 KXLU 88.9 fm</p></div>
