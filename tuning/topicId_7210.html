I&apos;m saying that it&apos;s only one<br/>&gt;path to the tightest possible motion, and that the method I&apos;m already<br/>&gt;using is another</p><p>I agreed.</p><p>But you have just revealed that you are in fact using a 12-tET grid to<br/>achieve this positioning. Perhaps this is where you&apos;re falling short of<br/>optimality. See if you can try abandoning this grid (I know, easier said<br/>than done, but a small step in this direction might make for a big<br/>improvement in tuning). Clearly, a piece that consisted only of two<br/>non-overlapping chords, C E G and D F A, would not be tunable by this<br/>approach. But I think you&apos;ll find that in just about any _real_ classical<br/>work, there would always be some other chord nearby, say A C E, which would<br/>allow you to position the chords relative to one another being guided<br/>strictly by the harmonic relations that occur, without imposing any overall<br/>grid of centered tunings for each note.</p><p>What I would think is that, in a pre-19th century piece of music, occurences<br/>of G# and Ab, though named identically in the MIDI file, would occur far<br/>enough apart in the music so that they wouldn&apos;t be attached with a spring,<br/>or at least not a very strong one. As a result, the two pitches would come<br/>out quite different, as they would in a meantone tuning. In fact, I would<br/>expect most pre-19th century music to _naturally_ approach something close<br/>to meantone tuning (if 5-limit is the overall paradigm expressed in your<br/>tuning files) if this method is used.</p></div>
