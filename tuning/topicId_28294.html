Discussions about the crisis itself, and<br/>especially its political aspects, have been directed to the related<br/>metatuning group.</p><p>I realize that there have been other kinds of &quot;distractions&quot; here from<br/>time to time of a less urgent and also more unfortunately contentious<br/>nature, involving not an international tragedy but differences in<br/>intonational philosophy taken too personally and antagonistically.<br/>That is part of our collective history here -- something made by imperfect<br/>humans, as elsewhere -- and the striving toward a more perfect civility<br/>continues.</p><p>Please let me express regret for any misunderstandings on any side, and<br/>hope that from here on, friendly dialogue and sharing may prevail.</p><p>Most respectfully,</p><p>Margo Schulter<br/><a href="mailto:mschulter@value.net">mschulter@value.net</a></p></div><h3><a id=28367 href="#28367">ðŸ”—</a>mschulter &#x3C;MSCHULTER@VALUE.NET&#x3E;</h3><span>9/20/2001 10:17:00 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Hello, there, Gene, Paul, and others, and please let me reply to your<br/>recent post which I saw at Yahoo after posting what I wrote yesterday on<br/>the question of Dufay.</p><p>First, as the person who wrote the Pythagorean Tuning FAQ at</p><p><a href="http://www.medieval.org/emfaq/harmony/pyth.html">http://www.medieval.org/emfaq/harmony/pyth.html</a></p><p>I&apos;d like to thank you for quoting the discussion on Dunstable and<br/>Dufay fairly and accurately, and very wisely observing that questions<br/>of intonation for this epoch in the early 15th century _are_<br/>left ambiguous in the FAQ, and especially this portion of it.</p><p>Your post makes explicit something that maybe I was drifting around<br/>when I wrote that passage in 1998: the FAQ doesn&apos;t address all the<br/>possible nuances of vocal intonation in this epoch, and just maybe<br/>that was the wisest policy, especially for a document focusing mainly<br/>on the 13th-14th centuries. The complication with the early 15th<br/>century is that it&apos;s a transitional epoch -- making it intriguing, and<br/>also maybe a bit elusive, especially for flexible pitch intonation.</p><p>As the passage you quoted makes clear, we&apos;re quite in accord on the<br/>nature of Renaissance music: meantone or some kind of 5-limit system<br/>rather than Pythagorean tuning is what fits.</p><p>Here the problem comes in deciding how we approach the transition<br/>between the medieval and Renaissance eras, a kind of transition<br/>bridged by Dunstable and Dufay. Are they medieval or Renaissance from<br/>an intonational viewpoint -- or maybe represent a distinct<br/>&quot;transitional&quot; viewpoint mixing elements of both the earlier and later<br/>eras?</p><p>Certainly we agree, as the FAQ text you quoted also suggests, that<br/>Dunstable and Dufay are stylistically distinct from Perotin-Machaut.<br/>At the same time, I might ask: are Dunstable and Dufay also distinct<br/>from Josquin and Isaac around 1500, say, let alone Jannequin or<br/>Verdelot, say, in the epoch around 1530 of the chanson and emerging<br/>16th-century madrigal?</p><p>Also, while we learn as early as Martin Le Franc (1442) that Dufay and<br/>Binchois followed the &quot;English countenance&quot; of Dunstable to obtain<br/>&quot;sprightly concords,&quot; might there by some distinction between<br/>Dunstable and Dufay, who especially in his earlier years was also<br/>influenced by French and Italian traditions?</p><p>Here I&apos;d like to suggest that while &quot;smoothed&quot; or &quot;5-limit-like&quot;<br/>thirds seem to play a vital role in the music of Dunstable and of the<br/>early Dufay (say 1420-1440) alike, there may be some possible<br/>distinctions, and some mixtures of Pythagorean and &quot;5-limit-like&quot;<br/>elements.</p><p>We have some direct and indirect evidence, in fact, that intonational<br/>tastes may have varied in the early 15th century, with a 14th-century<br/>style Pythagorean tuning at one end of the spectrum, and something<br/>like pervasive 5-limit JI (or its adaptive approximation) for flexible<br/>pitch performances at the other.</p><p>Along with Mark Lindley, I would suggest that keyboard tunings of the<br/>era may give _some_ clue to how vocalists or players of flexible pitch<br/>instruments _may_ have approached these choices, and how composers<br/>_may_ have conceived the kind of tuning likely for their pieces.</p><p>For more on this, see Section 4.5 of the FAQ, some of which I&apos;ll try<br/>to sum up below -- but only as one possible approach, taking keyboard<br/>intonation as a possible guide, something not always so definitive<br/>when it comes to flexible pitch ensembles.</p><p>In my earlier response, you may note, I focused on Dufay rather than<br/>Dunstable, and that reflects my possible perception that as closely<br/>related as these composers are, they may represent somewhat different<br/>stylistic traditions.</p><p>Let&apos;s first consider some elements of the English tradition which<br/>might make a pervasive 5-limit interpretation for some of Dunstable&apos;s<br/>music quite attractive, although some kind of Pythagorean tuning seems<br/>the main documented kind of approach for keyboards.</p><p>As early as the 13th century, we find English pieces with thirds in<br/>closing sonorities, and Coussemaker&apos;s Anonymous IV comments on this<br/>practice in the &quot;Westcountry&quot; of England of treating thirds as &quot;the<br/>best concords.&quot; Writing around 1300, Walter Odington notes the<br/>proximity of the Pythagorean ratios to 5:4 and 6:5, and suggests that<br/>singers make some kind of adjustment (in pitch or in timbre?) to make<br/>these intervals fully concordant in practice.</p><p>While English music of the 13th-14th centuries follows a spectrum of<br/>styles ranging from Continental-like to pervasively tertian or<br/>&quot;5-limit-like,&quot; the music of John Dunstable (c. 1370-1453) often leans<br/>toward the latter style, although thirds to my best (and not so<br/>comprehensive) knowledge always remain inconclusive -- that is, do not<br/>occur in closing sonorities. Please anyone feel free to correct this<br/>statement if there are counterexamples.</p><p>What I recall hearing in some of Dunstable&apos;s motet textures, for<br/>example, is a treatment of thirds which I might term &quot;static&quot; although<br/>not quite stable: they just seem to &quot;hang around,&quot; with the melodic<br/>lines flowing around them or from one such &quot;static&quot; tertian sonority<br/>to another. There are also some Continental pieces around 1400 with<br/>this kind of effect on me, specifically one by Jean Vaillant -- in<br/>contrast to other of his pieces with a typical 14th-century feeling of<br/>directed motion.</p><p>Here a 5-limit-like style seems a very attractive interpretation, with<br/>possible Pythagorean touches at certain directed cadences. The English<br/>precedents, and the nature of the music, make this at least one likely<br/>historical interpretation, maybe more so if fixed pitch keyboards are<br/>not involved.</p><p>With much of Dufay&apos;s early music, I would say that the &quot;coloristic&quot;<br/>role of thirds might still have some ties to the Ars Nova tradition in<br/>France and Italy where they serve as points of motion, relatively<br/>concordant (as they are regarded in much 13th-14th century theory) but<br/>unstable and somewhat tense also.</p><p>It&apos;s easy to say this for the &quot;14th-century-like&quot; portions of the<br/>Missa Sine Nomine from the 1420&apos;s -- evidently based on the chanson<br/>_Resvellies vous_ written for a marriage taking place in 1423. I would<br/>say that many of Dufay&apos;s chansons, also, carry for me expectations<br/>of 14th-century &quot;directionality&quot; and cadentiality, whether fulfilled<br/>or sometimes diverted.</p><p>Lindley has observed, more specifically, that the treatment of<br/>intermediate cadences and phrasing may suggest that Dufay often<br/>composed with expectations based on some kind of keyboard instrument<br/>(an organ or clavichord) for 12 notes tuned in the Pythagorean Gb-B<br/>arrangement.  He notes that sonorities such as A3-C#4-E4 often have<br/>what he calls a &quot;stable&quot; and I might call a &quot;prolonged noncadential&quot;<br/>role, the sonorities where schisma thirds (e.g. A3-Db4-E4 as realized<br/>on a Gb-B keyboard) would have a smooth, quasi-5-limit, effect.</p><p>In contrast, he finds that sonorities such as G3-B3-D4, with regular<br/>Pythagorean thirds on such a keyboard, are not used in this fashion by<br/>the early Dufay. He thus suggests that Dufay&apos;s vocal music of the<br/>early period could have been based on such a keyboard.</p><p>Here I would like to suggest that the new element is not the use of<br/>thirds, sometimes prolonged, at points of inconclusive phrase or<br/>sectional endings -- this can be found in the French music of the 13th<br/>and 14th centuries also. In the Perotin-Machaut era, such thirds are<br/>evidently regarded as _partial_ concords, with some emphasis on<br/>&quot;partial,&quot; and I find pausing on a usual Pythagorean sonority such as<br/>G3-B3-D3, or A3-C#4-E4 in the Eb-G# tuning likely popular in the 14th<br/>century, quite pleasing and stylistically fitting.</p><p>Sometime around 1400, however, there was evidently a perception,<br/>discussed by Lindley, that using schisma thirds for these points of<br/>pauses had a different and pleasing effect -- and Dufay around<br/>1420-1440 seems to make the most of it.</p><p>In this interpretation, the contrast between usual Pythagorean and<br/>schisma thirds is part of the attractiveness of the music, an element<br/>not present in either a traditional 14th-century interpretation with<br/>its more consistently regular Pythagorean thirds, or a later 15th-16th<br/>century interpretation with its pervasive 5-limit sonorities.</p><p>Like Lindley, I have found that the kind of moving fauxbourdon or<br/>related textures often favored by the young Dufay can be served very<br/>nicely by Pythagorean intonation -- something I might not have guessed<br/>before trying it on a keyboard. Here we have thirds in motion, and<br/>Lindley and I both like the dynamic quality of the more complex<br/>Pythagorean texture.</p><p>At the same time, schisma thirds on prolonged noncadential sonorities<br/>can have a very striking and luminous effect, like rays of sunlight,<br/>like the announcement of the fresh breeze of a new era.</p><p>What I find credible, although this is a matter of guessing and of<br/>personal taste alike, is that the taste for those schisma thirds could<br/>have been combined with a taste for Pythagorean thirds in directed<br/>cadences, the latter advocated by Prosdocimus in 1413 and Ugolino of<br/>Orvieto around 1430-1440 or so, when they propose a 17-note<br/>Pythagorean system.</p><p>On a 12-note Gb-B keyboard, the constraints of fixed intonation<br/>dictate that thirds will be either usual Pythagorean or &quot;smoothed&quot;<br/>schisma versions depending on their position, and regardless of the<br/>musical context. Thus A3-C#4-E4 or A3-C#4-F#4 will have schisma thirds<br/>and sixths whether occurring in a cadential context or some other; and<br/>G3-B3-D4 will always be a usual Pythagorean sonority, the _quinta<br/>fissa_ or &quot;split fifth&quot; described by Jacobus of Liege around 1325.</p><p>Lindley compares this &quot;modal color&quot; to the key color of an<br/>18th-century well-temperament, and interestingly suggests that the<br/>prominent schisma thirds available in a mode such as D Dorian where<br/>cadential accidentals are applied could have influenced Renaissance<br/>modal patterns, which in turn helped shape the tonal patterns emerging<br/>by the later 17th century.</p><p>Vocalists or players of flexible pitch instruments, however, would not<br/>be so constrained -- they might produce either traditional or<br/>&quot;schismalike&quot; thirds at various locations, singing for example<br/>A3-C#4-F#4 before G3-D4-G4 at a directed cadence, and getting the<br/>regular Pythagorean thirds and sixths with their dynamic qualities;<br/>but A3-Db4-E4 for a prolonged noncadential sonority. A 17-note<br/>Pythagorean keyboard affords these choices for sonorities involving<br/>written sharps, for example.</p><p>How would early 15th-century singers use this freedom? Would they tend<br/>toward the kind of contrast between regular Pythagorean and schisma<br/>thirds found on keyboards in a Gb-B arrangement, but possibly based on<br/>musical context rather than strict position of sonorities? Or might<br/>they tend toward the approach: &quot;If we can sing these smooth thirds<br/>anywhere we want, why not sing them just about _everywhere_?&quot;</p><p>The latter approach, 5-limit JI or its adaptive approximation, may<br/>have attractions for the early music of Dufay, as well as for<br/>Dunstable and some of the English carol repertory; I would consider it<br/>as _one_ &quot;historically likely&quot; reading. We might say that it<br/>emphasizes the &quot;Renaissance-like&quot; aspects of the music.</p><p>A more &quot;modified Pythagorean&quot; approach for the early Dufay may give<br/>greater weight to the &quot;Ars-Nova-like&quot; elements, as well as to the<br/>keyboard tunings of the era and the cadential ethos of writers such as<br/>Ugolino, who expresses a preference for regular Pythagorean thirds and<br/>sixths at cadences but also recognizes the prevalence of the Gb-B<br/>tuning scheme.</p><p>One could actually argue that the second interpretation gives<br/>near-pure schisma thirds a special import, since they stand out<br/>against a context of more active regular Pythagorean thirds.</p><p>More generally, I would say that transitional epochs often present<br/>dilemmas of this kind: which elements are treated as more prominent,<br/>or more pervasive, or more likely in situations where performers have<br/>discretion of a kind not always addressed in theory, or covered by<br/>fixed-pitch tunings?</p><p>For example, I find it rather easy to say that a minor sixth before an<br/>octave constitutes a standard progression in Perotin around 1200, but<br/>typically would be inflected to major (by flatting or sharping) in the<br/>era of Machaut or Landini, at least in a prominent cadential setting.</p><p>However, what about the epoch of 1270-1300 say, the period of Adam de<br/>la Halle and Petrus de Cruce?</p><p>There are enough manuscript accidentals in this epoch to suggest that<br/>unwritten inflections might sometimes have been made, but I tend to<br/>regard this as &quot;optional&quot; and not necessarily prevalent. By the Ars<br/>Nova of Philippe de Vitry or Marchettus of Padua, we tend to regard it<br/>as &quot;standard&quot; practice.</p><p>Also, if a cadential sixth is indicated in a late 13th-century piece<br/>as inflected to major, should a cadential third in the same sonority<br/>also be inflected to major, as in this type of example from Adam de la<br/>Halle ((c. 1237-1287 or 1288):</p><p>         C#4     D4<br/>         G[#?]3  A3<br/>         E3      D3</p><p>For the major third before the fifth, one might quote Jacobus of Liege<br/>(an early 14th-century advocate of the 13th-century style of his youth<br/>against the &quot;moderns&quot; of the Ars Nova), as well as a treatise around<br/>1300 suggesting that inflections are used to get pure fifths or<br/>fourths which would otherwise be tritonic (here between the upper<br/>voices).</p><p>An interesting implication of this specific example is that one is<br/>introducing an accidental, G#, not to my best knowledge found in<br/>13th-century manuscripts, although it becomes routine in the early<br/>14th century (e.g. Marchettus).</p><p>To sum up, I would like very warmly to thank you not only for raising<br/>the Dunstable and Dufay questions, and quoting the FAQ in a way which<br/>maybe shows me how I may have diplomatically skirted around a delicate<br/>question, but also inviting a consideration of the more general issue<br/>of transitional styles, intonational or otherwise.</p><p>Most appreciatively,</p><p>Margo Schulter<br/><a href="mailto:mschulter@value.net">mschulter@value.net</a></p></div><h3><a id=28407 href="#28407">ðŸ”—</a>genewardsmith@juno.com</h3><span>9/20/2001 10:52:36 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In tuning@y..., mschulter &lt;MSCHULTER@V...&gt; wrote:</p><p>&gt; First, as the person who wrote the Pythagorean Tuning FAQ at<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; <a href="http://www.medieval.org/emfaq/harmony/pyth.html">http://www.medieval.org/emfaq/harmony/pyth.html</a><br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I&apos;d like to thank you for quoting the discussion on Dunstable and<br/>&gt; Dufay fairly and accurately, and very wisely observing that<br/>questions<br/>&gt; of intonation for this epoch in the early 15th century _are_<br/>&gt; left ambiguous in the FAQ, and especially this portion of it.</p><p>I&apos;m glad to hear that--I was wading in unexpectedly deeply since I<br/>didn&apos;t know one of our group members was the author of that FAQ!</p><p>I am happy to have played a part in eliciting two such very<br/>informative postings.</p></div><h3><a id=28493 href="#28493">ðŸ”—</a>jpehrson@rcn.com</h3><span>9/23/2001 3:43:33 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In tuning@y..., mschulter &lt;MSCHULTER@V...&gt; wrote:</p><p><a href="/tuning/topicId_28294.html#28367">/tuning/topicId_28294.html#28367</a></p><p>I would just like to say that this recent post by Margo Schulter is<br/>probably the most incredible post on the subject of<br/>Medieval/Renaissance music that I have read within the last couple of<br/>years...</p><p>Although I had read and studied through section 4.5 of the Medieval<br/>FAQ, I really didn&apos;t understand the *implications* of it until this<br/>most recent Schulter post.</p><p>I guess I rather &quot;glossed over&quot; the idea of two different kinds of<br/>thirds, the schismatic (similar to 5-limit) and Pythagorean implicit<br/>in Pythagorean tuning, depending on which ones were used!</p><p>How much we are missing when we try to play this music in 12-tET!
