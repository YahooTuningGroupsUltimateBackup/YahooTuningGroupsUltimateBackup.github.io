My purpose<br/>here is not to suggest that these factors have been ignored, but<br/>possibly to highlight some of their aspects at more length.</p><p>--------------------------------------<br/>1. Stylistic dissonance and consonance<br/>--------------------------------------</p><p>A bit more than 30 years ago, I met three singers who very kindly<br/>offered to perform a three-part conductus I had written in a more or<br/>less conventional 13th-century style. Such an impromptu sight-reading<br/>was hardly the easiest task, especially at an unexpected time and<br/>place for this kind of musicmaking.</p><p>At the end of the first phrase, where I had written a typical cadence<br/>something like this (here given in MIDI-style notation, with C4 as<br/>middle C):</p><p>D5  E5<br/>B4  A4<br/>G4  A4</p><p>one of the singers happened to arrive at the note C#4 rather than A4<br/>or E4 -- or, at any rate, at some third. At that moment, I vividly<br/>learned the nature of &quot;stylistic dissonance.&quot;</p><p>Whether that C#4 had been tuned as a 5:4, an 81:64, a 23:18, or a 9:7,<br/>it would have simply been &quot;out of place&quot; in a sonority meant to be<br/>stable -- in this style of course, not necessarily in the style of the<br/>next piece you happen to be performing or listening to, or maybe the<br/>new style you&apos;re now (re)inventing for the 21st century.</p><p>Looking back on this episode, in which the generosity of those three<br/>singers is much more important than their fortuitous &quot;slip&quot; which<br/>taught me an important musical lesson, itself a precious gift, causes<br/>me to reflect on a curious question.</p><p>If someone requested that I conclude a piece in Gothic or neo-Gothic<br/>style with some sonority more complex than a 2:3:4 trine (outer<br/>octave, lower fifth, upper fourth, e.g. D3-A3-D4) which sonority would<br/>I choose?</p><p>As first choice, and with some theoretical medieval sanction, I would<br/>close with a 1:3:9 or 1:6:9 (e.g. D3-A4-E6 or D3-A5-E6), the latter<br/>having the advantage of being playable in real time by one person on a<br/>conventional keyboard instrument. To my ears, curiously, this sonority<br/>seems almost as &quot;concordant&quot; as a usual 2:3:4 trine, although more<br/>complex: somehow the notes occupy the same aural space without the<br/>kind of tension which in a trinic context suggests &quot;instability.&quot;</p><p>Since Jacobus of Liege (c. 1325) lists 9:1 as a &quot;perfect concord&quot;<br/>along with more traditional stable intervals such as octaves, fifths,<br/>and fourths, my choice would have some historical as well as aesthetic<br/>basis.</p><p>If requested to remain within a typical medieval compass of around a<br/>twelfth, then to a complete 2:3:4 trine (e.g. D3-A3-D4) I would add a<br/>note forming a sonority maintaining a quintal/quartal color such as<br/>6:8:9:12 (e.g. D3-G3-A3-D4), 8:9:12:16 (e.g. D3-E3-A3-D4), or 4:6:8:9<br/>(e.g. D3-A3-D4-E4).</p><p>Again, although such a usage goes beyond known Gothic practice, there<br/>are possible constructions of theory one might borrow to explain it:<br/>for example, the famous four hammers or strings 6:8:9:12 of Pythagoras<br/>described by various medieval authors. However, my main argument would<br/>be that, if we are to go beyond the historical bounds of the stable<br/>trine, sonorities of this kind seem the most &quot;trinelike&quot; or<br/>&quot;stylistically concordant.&quot;</p><p>Whether or not 9:8 or 9:4 is regarded as the most &quot;sensorily<br/>consonant&quot; ratio beyond 2:3:4, it seems to me the most stylistically<br/>fitting, or the least unfitting, interval to add to a final sonority<br/>maintaining a &quot;Gothiclike&quot; -- or &quot;neo-Gothic&quot; -- flavor.</p><p>Other questions remain. For example, does the very &quot;concordant&quot; effect<br/>for me of 1:3:9 or 1:6:9 relate in some way to the low products of the<br/>three terms (1*3*9 = 27; 1*6*9 = 54)? Or is it in large part of matter<br/>of octave spacing diluting the tension of the major 23rd by placing<br/>any beating between partials outside the &quot;critical band?&quot;</p><p>Of course, with these extraordinary sonorities and with the more usual<br/>6:8:9 or 8:9:12, etc., the predominantly &quot;quintal/quartal&quot; color seems<br/>a main attraction.</p><p>This discussion brings me to a related but slightly different question<br/>of &quot;stylistic consonance,&quot; the question of the 16:9.</p><p>-------------------------------------------------------------<br/>2. The status of 16:9 -- placing &quot;entropy&quot; in musical context<br/>-------------------------------------------------------------</p><p>One feature of certain 13th-14th century as well as 20th-century<br/>European and related styles is a penchant for freely treated minor<br/>sevenths tuned at a just 16:9 (~996.09 cents), or at the modern<br/>approximation of 1000 cents.</p><p>Thus one scholar of the style of Guillaume de Machaut (c. 1300-1377)<br/>remarked that he seems at times to treat minor sevenths as &quot;imperfect<br/>consonances,&quot; and 20th-century practice and theory often shows a<br/>similar preference.</p><p>Around 1200, this &quot;partially concordant&quot; quality is especially notable<br/>in 9:12:16 with its two pure 4:3 fourths complementing the outer 16:9<br/>(e.g. G3-C4-F4). In one late 14th-century piece I find that sonorities<br/>combining a minor seventh, fifth, and minor third, e.g. D3-F3-C4 at<br/>27:32:48, can also have a pleasingly &quot;mild&quot; quality, a &quot;jazzlike&quot;<br/>or &quot;floating&quot; effect.</p><p>Interestingly, recent discussions on harmonic entropy have suggested<br/>that a minor seventh at a pure 16:9 (two pure 4:3 fourths), or at the<br/>1000 cents of 12-tET, is in a local region of maximum complexity or<br/>&quot;entropy,&quot; in comparison to the simpler regions around 7:4 or 9:5.</p><p>A region of maximal complexity, indeed, has been placed by Paul<br/>Erlich&apos;s sophisticated computer routine at around 999 cents; the Noble<br/>Mediant or &quot;two Keenans function&quot; published here by Keenan Pepper and<br/>applied to harmonic entropy by Dave Keenan suggests a maximum at<br/>around 1001 cents. By such measures, a pure Gothic 16:9 is quite<br/>&quot;dissonant,&quot; and the interval of 10/12 octave or 1000 cents so beloved<br/>in many 20th-century styles is almost exactly at the point of &quot;maximum<br/>dissonance.&quot;</p><p>Further, it appears that 16:9 may be less clearly defined from an<br/>acoustical point of view than its octave complement 9:8 -- an<br/>asymmetry which may also apply to intervals such as the 5-limit major<br/>third at 5:4 and considerably less &quot;sensorily consonant&quot; minor sixth<br/>at 8:5.</p><p>Happily, however, whatever the acoustical complexity of a minor<br/>seventh at 16:9 or 1000 cents, styles which treat this interval as to<br/>some degree &quot;compatible&quot; or even &quot;concordant&quot; remain free to do so.</p><p>Through the years, I have regarded 16:9 as an ideal ratio for a minor<br/>seventh because of the derivation from the two pure fourths, a<br/>derivation perfectly realized in Pythagorean tuning and approximated<br/>in temperaments such as 12-tET or the yet closer 29-tET.</p><p>The observation that these intervals are actually near a local maximum<br/>of complexity is certainly a noteworthy one, in part because it<br/>illustrates how musical styles have their own sense of system and<br/>&quot;concord&quot; in which complexity or entropy from one point of view may<br/>represent just proportion and harmoniousness from another point of<br/>view.</p><p>To say that a minor seventh around 16:9 is near a point of &quot;maximal<br/>entropy&quot; may be a bit like saying that Paris, in comparison to a place<br/>high in the Alps, is at a point of &quot;maximal gravity&quot; because closer to<br/>the Earth&apos;s center. The latter remark is a very accurate statement of<br/>physics, yet should not be taken to imply that Parisians find it<br/>difficult to walk or climb gentle hills because of the greater<br/>acceleration of gravity.</p><p>-------------------------------------<br/>3. Entropy and categorical perception<br/>-------------------------------------</p><p>The phenomenon of &quot;harmonic entropy&quot; might usefully be compared with<br/>another stylistically-related concept which I term, after Brian<br/>McLaren for example, _categorical perception_ or &quot;categorical<br/>ambiguity.&quot; These two different kinds of concepts sometimes, but not<br/>always, may be synonymous for a given region of the continuum of<br/>intervals in a given style.</p><p>For example, while a 16:9 minor seventh or one at 1000 cents may be in<br/>a region of &quot;maximal entropy,&quot; it is, at least in many medieval and<br/>20th-century Western European styles, near the very center of the<br/>range of categorical recognition or &quot;minor seventhness.&quot; However<br/>acoustically simple or complex, it is an ideal minor seventh in these<br/>stylistic settings.</p><p>In contrast, another &quot;entropy maximum&quot; is located in one of Erlich&apos;s<br/>computer-generated mappings at around 457 cents, a region which is<br/>also categorically ambiguous in many of these same styles as a kind of<br/>transitional zone between a large major third and a narrow fourth.</p><p>Thus from a neo-Gothic perspective, I use a minor seventh at or close<br/>to 16:9 as a &quot;normal&quot; interval, one realizing or approximating the<br/>ideal of Pythagorean just intonation. In contrast, an interval of<br/>around 450-455 cents (e.g. 11/29 octave or 9/24 octave) is a &quot;special<br/>effect,&quot; a deliberate blurring of familiar categories.</p><p>Please let me emphasize that to focus on the important stylistic<br/>factor of categorical perception or ambiguity is not to argue that any<br/>given style should be taken as a &quot;natural&quot; or universal standard of<br/>musical perception or propriety. It is simply to assert that a given<br/>style, like a given natural language, may have its own patterns of<br/>musical &quot;phonology&quot; and &quot;grammar.&quot;</p><p>The ancient Greek historian Herodotus, citing the poet Pindar, once<br/>remarked that &quot;_nomos_ is monarch of all,&quot; _nomos_ meaning custom or<br/>convention. This observation can apply to musical styles also.</p><p>Far from being made irrelevant by such considerations, harmonic<br/>entropy theory can serve to illuminate the element of stylistic<br/>variety and choice, the many patterns of acoustical simplicity and<br/>complexity which take shape in a given style or tuning.</p><p>Most respectfully,</p><p>Margo Schulter<br/><a href="mailto:mschulter@value.net">mschulter@value.net</a></p></div><h3>Monz &#x3C;MONZ@JUNO.COM&#x3E;</h3><span>9/27/2000 1:05:11 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Hello Margo.
