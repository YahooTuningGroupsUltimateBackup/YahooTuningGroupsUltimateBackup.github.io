But<br/>when I think of the many models for me, the styles range through a<br/>very wide spectrum of musical/cultural idioms.</p><p>And I may still come up short in being able to describe in text what<br/>the ineffable &quot;quality&quot; is, that makes me want to continue to hear<br/>certain music over and over again. But whatever this may be, is<br/>definitely conveyed through certain musics.</p><p>I started out as a kid with things like Morton Sobotnek, Wendy<br/>Carlos, Punk Rock, Partch, Techno, Free Jazz, Varese, Heavy Metal and<br/>Stravinsky. Some of these forms endure for me over the years, while<br/>others lose their novelty and get played less.</p><p>Not to encourage or discourage, but more and more these days, I find<br/>myself drawn to listening to traditional musics - acoustic musics.<br/>But the irony is, that I play and make music with both electronic and<br/>acoustic instruments. Perhaps for me, my subjective &quot;best&quot; models for<br/>the sound I wish to create, are to be found in acoustic musics, as<br/>the source for inspiration. Maybe even one day, I&apos;ll just &quot;go<br/>acoustic&quot; (we are planning a accapella choir CD in Just Intonations<br/>up to 37 Limit this year).</p><p>To invite discussion on this topic, I&apos;d like to ask others who have<br/>listened to music of many kinds, for many years, and have played many<br/>styles for many years:</p><p>In your opinion, what are the qualities that make music endure?</p><p>What are the attributes of any music you love, that repeatedly makes<br/>you seek it out through the years?</p><p>Is it at all important to contemplate what qualities may we observe,<br/>and perhaps adopt to our own purposes, that may help our own music<br/>endure repeated listenings?</p><p>Is this important to any kind of &quot;imagined&quot; Microtonal Movement?<br/>There&apos;s allot of CDs I&apos;ve heard out of our beloved Tuning List, which<br/>I *will* be playing as long as the CD format is supported.  I sense<br/>that for many here, &quot;the qualities that make music endure repeated<br/>listening&quot;, stand as one of a number of grounding philosophical<br/>approaches to music creation.  This is born out by the fact that I<br/>possess so many fine works of impeccable microtonal music, from some<br/>of the most creative gentlefolk I&apos;ve ever known - right here.  The<br/>philosophy of creating enduring music lives here, from all I&apos;ve seen.</p><p>&quot;Uplifting Energy&quot; to me, equates and is a metaphor, for<br/>this &quot;Enduring Quality&quot;. Which can cover an inconceivably large range<br/>of musical expression and emotion.</p><p>Thanks,</p><p>Jacky Ligon</p></div><h3>monz &#x3C;MONZ@JUNO.COM&#x3E;</h3><span>3/16/2001 1:30:41 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In tuning@y..., ligonj@n... wrote:</p><p><a href="http://groups.yahoo.com/group/tuning/message/20220">http://groups.yahoo.com/group/tuning/message/20220</a></p><p>&gt; To invite discussion on this topic, I&apos;d like to ask others<br/>&gt; who have listened to music of many kinds, for many years, and<br/>&gt; have played many styles for many years:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; In your opinion, what are the qualities that make music endure?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; What are the attributes of any music you love, that repeatedly<br/>&gt; makes you seek it out through the years?</p><p>Hi Jacky.</p><p>I found this question especially intriguing, partly because I<br/>have a similarly varied (quite possibly even moreso) selection<br/>of music that I&apos;ve admired for a long, long time, and have<br/>also noticed the waxing and waning of my interest in various<br/>artists or styles over the years.</p><p>For myself, I think the musics that last the longest on my<br/>playlist are the one that incorporate an exquisite marriage<br/>of intellectual interest, powerful emotional engagement,<br/>and ear-tickling sounds.</p><p>Often, as we see in genres such as opera or artists such as<br/>Partch or Springsteen, extra-musical artistic means (poetry,<br/>choreography, etc.) also play a significant role in seizing<br/>my attention.</p><p>Then there&apos;s the dichotomy of studio perfection versus that<br/>&quot;je ne sais quoi&quot; of great live performance, especially<br/>when the audience is really riding that wave.

Yet the power is under control. You<br/>can feel<br/>&gt; the power, and as you listen you ownder if its going to explode or<br/>not, you<br/>&gt; wonder if the musician is going to lose it. But in the end a good<br/>musician<br/>&gt; maintains control, and the power is ocntained. That is guitar music<br/>I like<br/>&gt; to hear.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Aslo I like cool licks to repeat themselves. Too many excellent<br/>guitar<br/>&gt; players have cool licks that only show up once on an album. you got<br/>to start<br/>&gt; the whole song over to hear that one cool lick. I say, if its cool,<br/>play it<br/>&gt; a few times so the audience can hear it. If they like it, they&apos;ll<br/>want to<br/>&gt; hear it more than once.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Travis<br/>&gt; <a href="http://www.freestyleguitar.com">www.freestyleguitar.com</a><br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; ----- Original Message -----<br/>&gt; From: &quot;David J.
