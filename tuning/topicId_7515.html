It really had<br/>&gt;nothing to do with my high school choral teacher warming up the group<br/>&gt;building major triads a cappella.

If the 7th is 3/2 relative to the major third, then the 7th is 27/14<br/>relative to the root, implying the small interval of 28/27 between the<br/>upper octave of the root and the 7th.

That piece is only a minute and 23 seconds, the shortest on the disc.  It also includes a 4:11 excerpt from Partch&apos;s &quot;And on the Seventh Day, Petals Fell in Petaluma&quot; and Clara Rockmore playing Saint-Saens &quot;The Swan&quot; on a Theremin (from the Delos CD, &quot;The Art of the Theremin&quot;).<br/>Should you have difficulty locating a copy of this CD or want a copy of their catalog, write or call Ellipsis Arts, P.O.
