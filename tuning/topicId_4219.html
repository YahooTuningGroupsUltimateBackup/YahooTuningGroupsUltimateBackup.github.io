For those with really good memories, (Hi JoeM!) I still<br/>have the pre-archived TDs and one-day will have the lot up for ftp.<br/>At least the ftp&apos;s will be quicker from NYC than Western Australia...</p><p>I can verify the nylon fret approach of Doty&apos;s works fine and used<br/>the knot he showed in his book, wrapping the monofilament twice<br/>around the neck for each fret. I found I needed to use pliers to<br/>tighten the monofilament enough. If your neck is set up correctly,<br/>use the same gauge nylon thread over the entire neck. I use &quot;type<br/>30&quot;, presumably 30 thousandths of an inch. A down side is<br/>monofilament for fishing is made of transparent blue (so the fish<br/>can&apos;t see it???), which makes it difficult for guitarists under stage<br/>lights (not that I encounter that problem often :-). I also<br/>encountered suspicious looks from the guy behind the counter at the<br/>fishing tackle shop, seems fisherpeople are the same the world over<br/>:-)</p><p>I&apos;ve also experimented with nylon cable ties, but I&apos;m yet to find<br/>thin enough versions for a workable action. These are better because<br/>they self tighten, whereas the tie-ons need to be pushed up the neck<br/>towards the bridge, so you need to work from the highest pitch frets<br/>first, down to those nearest the nut. The frets stay remarkably well<br/>in place and are my preference if you are playing ET, than hammering<br/>frets in.
