I think that&apos;s what I meant, except that the major scale<br/>does have a place in polyphony especially because not all other scales are<br/>as easy to make the combinations of pitches match.  But my point really<br/>is that the construction of the major scale and its evolution has nothing<br/>to do with the arbitrary tetrads of every-other-note that people talk about<br/>when discussing 7th chords.  Chords are not defined by scales.  Scales and<br/>chords exist independantly and yes, we often consider how they affect one<br/>another or how they co-exist.</p><p>The main thing is that within a simple, small scale structure, we can easily<br/>add much more extensive chords that have content outside the scale,<br/>without destroying the sense of scale at all.  Outside the 12TET world,<br/>it is even easier, ear-wise, to have 7/6&apos;s and 7/4&apos;s and even 14/9&apos;s or<br/>whatever, within a piece that is totally a major scale piece.</p><p>Scales are essentially melodic frameworks.  They don&apos;t preclude or include<br/>much about potential chords.</p><p>I think my main revelation about this myself was when I realized that<br/>adding up all the notes in all the chords I liked in a piece didn&apos;t mean<br/>that the scale of the piece was the sum of those notes.</p><p>I think the main structural points, melodically, can be considered the<br/>scale.  It is most accurate to what makes sense to my ear to then<br/>include the ideas of nonharmonic notes (passing notes and such)<br/>and to consider hidden, extra, stacked sorts of chord-notes as being<br/>part of their individual chord-context.  They don&apos;t really change the<br/>scale as perceived.</p><p>-Aaron</p></div><h3>ambassadorbob &#x3C;ambassadorbob@yahoo.com&#x3E;</h3><span>3/27/2006 12:43:39 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Hi guys,</p><p>It took a minute to click, and I&apos;m hardly exhaustive in my<br/>examination of it, but I don&apos;t believe, for example, that the *7th<br/>harmonic* has anything to do with harmonic function, or a &quot;dominant<br/>seventh chord&quot;.

And in order to work together there<br/>needs to be a system of priorities and all the elements need to<br/>honor that and be working in the same direction.</p><p>Some music, like babershop harmony, is actually focusing on the<br/>harmony, and is partly defined by having a melody well-suited to<br/>the harmonic structure.  A good barbershop melody sorta includes<br/>something of the harmonic structure by implication.  Many melodies<br/>do not do this, and overly harmonizing a melody that doesn&apos;t call<br/>for it is usually not effective.</p><p>I appreciate music that focuses on any of these various elements,<br/>but I find it annoying to have a complex, beautiful melody obscured<br/>by overly complex harmony.  Every piece, or interpretation for that<br/>matter, really should have a focus (or shifting focus is fine) on one<br/>of these elements.  It is a very rare (but extraordinary and only the<br/>best) piece that actually has a melody and lyric and rhythm and<br/>harmony (and timbre and and etc) that all work together and support<br/>each other instead of conflict.</p><p>-Aaron</p></div><h3>Petr Par&#xED;zek &#x3C;p.parizek@chello.cz&#x3E;</h3><span>3/27/2006 11:37:50 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Gene wrote:</p><p>&gt; There&apos;s some fusion, with the Bb sticking out; even though at 31 cents<br/>&gt; sharp in 12edo it is way sharp, it has some of the sense of otonality.<br/>&gt; In other words, sort of; it&apos;s a poor man&apos;s otonal tetrad but it does<br/>&gt; do the work of one. The meantone C-E-G-A# is more to the point; this<br/>&gt; has the sound of an otonal tetrad.</p><p>I absolutely agree.<br/>I don&apos;t know if I should say &quot;unfortunately&quot; or &quot;fortunately&quot; but anyway,<br/>nowadays, the way I listen to some pieces has been so much influenced by<br/>playing in various meantones  quite a lot that I like using the 7/4 as an<br/>augmented sixth in most cases.<br/>It often happens to me, when i hear a 4:5:6:7 on G and then a 2:3:4:5 on C,<br/>that I don&apos;t feel this progression as &quot;pleasant to my ears&quot; as others may,<br/>which is simply caused by the fact that the descending interval in the top<br/>voice (20/21) is too small for me to call it a minor second and I&apos;m<br/>&quot;hearing&quot; it as E#-E instead of F-E. And because it&apos;s not sort of my coup of<br/>tea to end a harmonic phrase with a chroma in the top voice, I prefer to<br/>choose a seventh of 16/9 for the first chord, which results in a regular<br/>5-limit minor second on the top.<br/>OTOH, when I hear a 4:5:6:7 on F and then a 2:3:4:5 on C, I&apos;m pleased in<br/>every way. For me, this progression doesn&apos;t have any &quot;fault harming its<br/>beauty&quot; even from the &quot;classical&quot; point of view. The &quot;soprano&quot; (let&apos;s call<br/>it like that for now) rises by a major second, which makes the harmonic<br/>phrase maximally convincing as a &quot;cadential&quot; progression, or in other words,<br/>perfect to be used at the very end. The alto stays unchanged so the common<br/>tone is kept. The tenor falls by a major second, which makes a nice contrary<br/>motion to the soprano. And the bass falls by a fourth, which confirms the<br/>progression itself even better.<br/>Some of you may find it weird of me to call the first chord an F-A-C-D# but,<br/>you see, that&apos;s the way I hear it.<br/>And, even more, hasn&apos;t this something in common with the favorite classical<br/>progression of F-A-C-D# | E-G#-B-E?</p><p>Petr</p></div><h3>Petr Par&#xED;zek &#x3C;p.parizek@chello.cz&#x3E;</h3><span>3/27/2006 11:49:00 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>&gt; But 7/5 is only off by 18 cents, so doesn&apos;t the ear hear C-E-G-Bb<br/>&gt; as 4:5:6:7, even in this simple diatonic sense?</p><p>Maybe yours does, anyway, mine does not.<br/>When I play a 16/9 or a 9/5, I tend to go on with a 5/3.

But scales are only one part of the<br/>&gt; nature of pitch content.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; In polyphonic music, the three major chords I-IV-V<br/>&gt; became prominant,<br/>&gt; &gt; and the notes inluded become the major scale.<br/>&gt; &gt; &quot;the dominant 7th doesn&apos;t appear till the 5th<br/>&gt; chord&quot;<br/>&gt; &gt; is a simplistic and not very accurate way to talk<br/>&gt; about it.  The 5th chord?<br/>&gt; &gt; The 5th in what order?  In the order of playing a<br/>&gt; chord with each note<br/>&gt; &gt; of the scale as a root?  But playing every other<br/>&gt; note in the scale above<br/>&gt; &gt; in strict tetrads, never leaving the scale?<br/>&gt; That&apos;s totally arbitrary!<br/>&gt; &gt; I could argue that the dominant chord never<br/>&gt; appears, since the diatonic<br/>&gt; &gt; major scale doesn&apos;t have any harmonic sevenths in<br/>&gt; it.  Or I could argue<br/>&gt; &gt; that the one you are talking about DOES count, but<br/>&gt; it is the 2nd chord<br/>&gt; &gt; not the fifth, since it is 2nd in prominance to<br/>&gt; the 1st chord.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; I cannot in reasonable time discuss all the nature<br/>&gt; of scales vs. chords<br/>&gt; &gt; and their nature and commonalities and<br/>&gt; differences.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; I CAN, however, boldy state that I think the idea<br/>&gt; that the major scale<br/>&gt; &gt; prefers a major 7 chord at the tonic, and that the<br/>&gt; dominant chord<br/>&gt; &gt; is the &quot;5th&quot; chord in the series, and most of the<br/>&gt; other simple things<br/>&gt; &gt; you&apos;ve mentioned, well...  These are all<br/>&gt; simplistic ways to teach theory<br/>&gt; &gt; and are not at all actual explanations of how<br/>&gt; music systems work.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; I think it&apos;d be better if we stop talking about<br/>&gt; scales as being so<br/>&gt; &gt; absolute.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; Anyway, all that aside, the playing of four notes,<br/>&gt; each with a<br/>&gt; &gt; complete spectrum, on a major 7 chord is nothing<br/>&gt; like the<br/>&gt; &gt; major 7 in the harmonic series.  The chord is more<br/>&gt; like an<br/>&gt; &gt; extended harmonization with two sets of perfect<br/>&gt; fifths, and two<br/>&gt; &gt; sets of major thirds that line up together and<br/>&gt; support each other<br/>&gt; &gt; well.  An open, two note root and major 7 harmony<br/>&gt; is much less<br/>&gt; &gt; common and much weaker.  It isn&apos;t the major 7 in<br/>&gt; the harmonic<br/>&gt; &gt; series that supports the major 7 chord, it is the<br/>&gt; building on<br/>&gt; &gt; strong harmonies on top of one another.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; In conclusion, I think this is all interesting,<br/>&gt; but there&apos;s nothing<br/>&gt; &gt; weird or contradictory to me, and I don&apos;t think<br/>&gt; the major scale&apos;s<br/>&gt; &gt; prominance is artificial, nor do I think it is<br/>&gt; strange or contradictory<br/>&gt; &gt; that the myxolydian mode is even more common in<br/>&gt; many styles.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; -Aaron<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; --<br/>&gt; Kraig Grady<br/>&gt; North American Embassy of Anaphoria Island<br/>&gt; &lt;<a href="http://anaphoria.com/">http://anaphoria.com/</a>&gt;<br/>&gt; The Wandering Medicine Show<br/>&gt; KXLU &lt;<a href="http://www.kxlu.com/main.html">http://www.kxlu.com/main.html</a>&gt; 88.9 FM Wed 8-9<br/>&gt; pm Los Angeles<br/>&gt;</p><p>__________________________________________________<br/>Do You Yahoo!?<br/>Tired of spam?

It is as if the intent of the composer serves as a point in which other meanings constellate around. yet without this intent, the expression to others might not be possible.<br/>Likewise when analyzing a piece of music or just a chord, it often will be possible to come up with many explanations. Symbols tend to transcend any singular explanation and the more of these we can witness, the more we can possibly appreciate the depth a single musical object can take.<br/>I tend to side with Gene on the Tristan chord. To my ear, it sounds more consonant than the chords it moves to. It is his use of the chromatic scale that allows such chords.

I like the gestalt way of wording it.  I think scale<br/>can<br/>&gt; be very prominant.  The main thing is that we can have structural,<br/>functional<br/>&gt; scales, and the subjective perception of scale is not destroyed by<br/>&gt; having harmonies that include notes outside the scale.  It is only if<br/>&gt; those outside notes have prominant melodic or polyphonic presence<br/>&gt; that they affect the sense of scale.  At least that&apos;s how it seems to me.</p><p>Whenever melody reigns, harmonies can serve<br/>more to enhance the timbres of melodic (scale)<br/>notes than to impart form.

For example, in 12-EDO, and in a<br/>homophonic style, we could harmonise the motif:<br/>D  E : F# G | a - : E - : F# E | D A : B C# | D</p><p>(sorry about the irregular metre!) with block chords,<br/>generally moving more slowly, in a straight kind of<br/>diatonic way, or perhaps as:<br/>Bb - : D    -  | F : C#m7 : F#m7 | Bm7 : C#m7 | Gm6</p><p>In my view, the exact tuning of these accompanying<br/>chords contributes little more than timbral colour.<br/>Tuning them within 12-EDO produces a more active,<br/>buzzy timbre; tuning them within JI produces a<br/>more relaxed timbre which blends smoothly into a<br/>role of supporting the melody.</p><p>It probably should not be necessary for me to add<br/>here that whilst, yes, scale and melody can be very<br/>prominent, they need not be, and are often subord-<br/>inate to harmony, rhythm or timbre.

One of the great qualities of music<br/>&gt; is its capacity for polymorphism and ambiguity. Likewise, one<br/>&gt; of the great qualities of our perceptual and cognitive apparatus<br/>&gt; is its capacity to handle that polymorphism and ambiguity.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Simultaneous melodic lines can be heard as harmonic structures,<br/>&gt; and sequences of harmonic structures can be heard as combinations<br/>&gt; of melodic lines. While one can play chicken-and-egg and assign<br/>&gt; priority -- compositional, interpretive, or perceptual -- to<br/>&gt; either harmony or to voice leading, any such assignment is<br/>&gt; ultimately a weak response to these capacities, and, to my ears,<br/>&gt; a denial of that which is unique and essential to music.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; We have had a good century and a half of analytical approaches to<br/>&gt; highly ambiguous music, including the Tristan Vorspiel, with one<br/>&gt; tradition (let&apos;s call it the Rameauvian, including Riemann,<br/>&gt; Schoenberg, and Martin Vogel) committed to harmonic interpretations of<br/>&gt; every vertical combination and another (let&apos;s call it the Fuxian, or<br/>&gt; voice-leading tradition, including the Schenkerians) zeroing in<br/>&gt; on the melodic construction.  It&apos;s about time to call a truce,<br/>&gt; and note that the two approaches complement and enrich one another,<br/>&gt; and still only begin to explain what makes music a rich and<br/>&gt; human experience.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; DJW<br/>&gt;</p><p>Amen!  Explaining the existence of one of these in terms of the other is<br/>definitely simplistic and innaccurate.  I&apos;ll add that the neatest thing is<br/>that musicians and composers who are aware of these interactions can<br/>choose to dynamically move in one direction or another or maintain<br/>an ambiguous middle ground, and use that balance to wonderful effect.<br/>While we can never fully separate these elements, it is the control and<br/>use and play between these factors that can make music so extremely<br/>dynamic and expressive.  I&apos;m certainly all for intentional ambiguity.</p><p>I think the biggest value of Schenkerian theory is the rejection of<br/>explaining everything vertically.  Schenkerian theory, of course, can<br/>be taken too rigidly as well though.</p><p>-Aaron</p></div>
