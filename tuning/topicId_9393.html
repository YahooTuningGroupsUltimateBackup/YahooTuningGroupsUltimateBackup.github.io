I&apos;ve known him by email for a while. He told<br/>&gt; me he has also made these guitars for Joe Satriani an John McLaughlin.<br/>&gt; We&apos;re doing a cd trade so hopefully I&apos;ll be playing his music on the<br/>&gt; show in the weeks to come. (Special Hindustani Guitar show on right<br/>&gt; now as I type!)<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I just heard Ned&apos;s stuff for the first time a couple of days ago (I<br/>&gt; had never even heard of him before you posted this bit a while back)<br/>&gt; and I think it&apos;s fabulous! He&apos;s really making the fretless the front<br/>&gt; and center focal point of his music... and all its playing<br/>&gt; idiosyncrasies and timbral quirks are set into his music like fine<br/>&gt; jewels. Mightily impressive!</p><p>I did get his cd, I played on 49/32. I have to update<br/>the archives. He&apos;s really something, reminds me of Steve<br/>Vai for some reason. He told me he doesn&apos;t know anything about<br/>ratios.</p><p>&gt;   <a href="mailto:tuning-abnormal@onelist.com">tuning-abnormal@onelist.com</a> - switch your subscription to abnormal mode.</p><p>We&apos;re there...</p><p>--<br/>* D a v i d         B e a r d s l e y<br/>*           <a href="mailto:xouoxno@virtulink.com">xouoxno@virtulink.com</a><br/>*<br/>* 49/32  R a d i o &quot;all microtonal, all the time&quot;<br/>* M E L A  v i r t u a l  d r e a m house monitor<br/>*<br/>* <a href="http://www.virtulink.com/immp/lookhere.htm">http://www.virtulink.com/immp/lookhere.htm</a></p></div><h3>David Beardsley &#x3C;xouoxno@virtulink.com&#x3E;</h3><span>3/30/2000 10:42:14 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>You should hear Kenta Naga on fretless. I played him<br/>on the January 9, 2000 edition of 49/32.</p><p>Here&apos;s the review I did for Downtown Music Gallery<br/>Newsletter #42 (<a href="http://www.dtmgallery.com">http://www.dtmgallery.com</a>):</p><p>a-un &iuml;&iquest;&half; Kenta Nagai and Tatsuya Nakatani (no label)<br/>There&apos;s been a few fretless guitarists over the<br/>years &iuml;&iquest;&half; Adrian Belew, Ned Evett, Randy Roos, Dave<br/>Fiuczynski, Jon Catler come to mind. Pat Metheny<br/>won a Grammy for his fretless classical performance<br/>on &apos;97&apos;s Imaginary Day. I heard about fretless guitarist<br/>Kenta Nagai for months and I finally caught up with<br/>him and percussionist Tatsuya Nakatani at the now<br/>regrettably revamped Knitting Factory Alterknit<br/>Theatre a few months ago. They knocked me out,<br/>this cd is a lot like that show.</p><p>After a short solo piece where Kenta slides around<br/>on fretless acoustic guitar, we are treated to a<br/>set recorded at Artemisia Gallery in Chicago. Solos and duos:<br/>Tatsuya sometimes favors a lot of friction sounds,<br/>but also spends a lot of time playing his set<br/>melodically yet tensely. As I recall, he had quite<br/>a nice collection of gongs and cymbals. Here Kenta<br/>begins the set on acoustic fretless guitar but<br/>finishes on electric. His playing on fretless displays<br/>a flipped out sense of intonation, I&apos;ll never be the<br/>same. There&apos;s a nice section where we hear gongs<br/>being struck while a distorted guitar slides in and<br/>out &iuml;&iquest;&half; overtone city &iuml;&iquest;&half; I need more!</p><p>--<br/>* D a v i d         B e a r d s l e y<br/>*           <a href="mailto:xouoxno@virtulink.com">xouoxno@virtulink.com</a><br/>*<br/>* 49/32  R a d i o &quot;all microtonal, all the time&quot;<br/>* M E L A  v i r t u a l  d r e a m house monitor<br/>*<br/>* <a href="http://www.virtulink.com/immp/lookhere.htm">http://www.virtulink.com/immp/lookhere.htm</a></p></div>
