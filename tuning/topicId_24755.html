Admittedly it flys in the face of<br/>&gt; Helmholtz, Erlich and, apparently, Daniel Wolf.</p><p>I believe it&apos;s patently untrue. The best way to demonstrate this is with two variable-pitch<br/>tone generators (don&apos;t use sine waves, though), preferably controlled continuously, as<br/>with knobs. Now you can easily sweep through the entire range of intervals. As you do<br/>this, you&apos;ll notice stretches of confused, &quot;rough&quot;, &quot;turbulent&quot; intervals, punctuated with<br/>points of &quot;focus&quot;, of &quot;blending&quot;, of &quot;stability&quot;. If you stop at one of these points, and<br/>measure the frequencies, you&apos;ll see that the ratio of the frequencies is a simple-integer<br/>ratio -- and I mean simple -- there probably won&apos;t be any higher numbers than 8 in<br/>these ratios unless you&apos;re dealing with ideal conditions of pitch, timbre, etc. Try this if<br/>you can. I tried this when I was very young, and it&apos;s overwhelmingly clear -- as clear as<br/>day.</p><p>Now whether these qualities have anything to do with music is another issue. I believe<br/>that some styles of music have, and even today (in the case of barbershop, for example),<br/>continue to function by seeking to obtain minimum &quot;roughness&quot; and &quot;turbulence&quot; in<br/>many vertical intervals and chords, while a few structurally important chords may be<br/>dissonant by contrast. Some styles, on the other hand, thrive on the &quot;turbulence&quot; and<br/>&quot;stability&quot; becomes a rare feature, to be exploited carefully. Many styles may use<br/>timbres and envelopes where only the very simplest of these ratios are of any<br/>perceptual relevance, while in other cases (such as, say, LaMonte Young&apos;s music), even<br/>rather complex ratios can be perceived. In all cases there is some degree of latitude,<br/>ranging from perhaps a fraction of a cent to about 20 cents depending on factors such as<br/>these, as to how precisely the ratios need to be tuned. But under no circumstances can I<br/>completely agree with the paraphrase of McLaren that you&apos;ve provided.</p></div><h3><a id=24801 href="#24801">ðŸ”—</a>George Zelenz &#x3C;ploo@mindspring.com&#x3E;</h3><span>6/10/2001 3:38:35 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Kraig wrote:</p><p>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;     With No.2  I&apos;ll place the music of Terry Riley , La Monte Young,<br/>&gt; Lou Harrison for there sure beauty of intervals against any ET<br/>&gt; composition i have ever heard.

What is a pitch? It&apos;s our brain&apos;s best estimate as to the<br/>fundamental of a best-fit harmonic series to the frequencies present. So even with sine<br/>waves, particularly three or more, there is a difference in the perception when the chord<br/>is a harmonic one compared to when it isn&apos;t. For example, if three sine waves are tuned<br/>5:6:7 or 6:7:8, one hears a virtual pitch corresponding to the 1, and the sine waves<br/>&quot;disappear&quot; into the sensation of the timbre. However, if the three sine waves are tuned<br/>11:13:15, which is too high in the harmonic series to be understood as such, one hears a<br/>confused sensation, with _two_ equally convincing candidates for what the pitch is --<br/>one corresponding to a best-fit based on a 5:6:7 interpretation, and one corresponding<br/>to a best-fit based on a 6:7:8 interpretation. You can read more about this in the last few<br/>chapters of _Musical Acoustics_ by Donald E. Hall, and the various academic articles<br/>referenced therein.</p></div><h3><a id=24804 href="#24804">ðŸ”—</a>Paul Erlich &#x3C;paul@stretch-music.com&#x3E;</h3><span>6/10/2001 3:59:44 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In tuning@y..., Kraig Grady &lt;kraiggrady@a...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt; Cousin Jeff!<br/>&gt;     No 1 without elaborating, contradicts 25 year experience with just these intervals.

Admittedly it flys in the face of<br/>&gt; &gt; Helmholtz, Erlich and, apparently, Daniel Wolf.<br/>&gt;</p><p>&gt; I believe it&apos;s patently untrue. The best way to demonstrate this is<br/>with two variable-pitch tone generators (don&apos;t use sine waves,<br/>though), preferably controlled continuously, as with knobs. Now you<br/>can easily sweep through the entire range of intervals. As you do<br/>&gt; this, you&apos;ll notice stretches of confused, &quot;rough&quot;, &quot;turbulent&quot;<br/>intervals, punctuated with points of &quot;focus&quot;, of &quot;blending&quot;,<br/>of &quot;stability&quot;. If you stop at one of these points, and<br/>&gt; measure the frequencies, you&apos;ll see that the ratio of the<br/>frequencies is a simple-integer ratio -- and I mean simple -- there<br/>probably won&apos;t be any higher numbers than 8 in<br/>&gt; these ratios unless you&apos;re dealing with ideal conditions of pitch,<br/>timbre, etc. Try this if you can.

In absolutely *no* way am I trying to<br/>start any kind of &quot;flame war&quot; or anything of the kind.  I was just<br/>interested in a discussion concerning the paraphrase from Brian<br/>McLaren&apos;s &quot;Introduction to Microtonality&quot; CD.  I believe the<br/>paraphrase is pretty accurate.  I was trying to find the exact quote<br/>from the CD, but I couldn&apos;t right off... and I&apos;ve have to play the<br/>entire thing again to find it... (I already played it twice!)  In any<br/>case, I found the comment a little surprising.  For me, personally, I<br/>remember experiments that I did in my early 20&apos;s with &quot;knob&quot;<br/>oscillators and I remember finding these different effects you<br/>mention, although I had no way of measuring the tones at that time...</p><p>&gt; Now whether these qualities have anything to do with music is<br/>another issue.</p><p>It seems to me that perhaps McLaren&apos;s COMPOSITIONAL focus may be<br/>determining his position on this issue.

You can look in Hall to see what<br/>the register actually was.

We&apos;ve gone over this<br/>many times before. The virtual fundamental, in general, is _not_ a difference tone or any other<br/>kind of combinational tone. For example, we&apos;ve talked about the case where a<br/>harmonic-series-plus-20-Hz-segment is played in sine waves. All the differences between<br/>these sine wave frequencies were exact multiples of 200 Hz. Yet the perceived pitch is not<br/>200 but something like 207 Hz. Not a difference tone, but rather a best-fit fundamental. If the<br/>stimulus is made loud enough, difference tones _will_ be heard -- and they will not agree with<br/>the virtual fundamental. Another reason why JI is special -- only if the sine waves are in JI will the<br/>virtual fundamental agree with a combinational tone.</p></div><h3><a id=24839 href="#24839">ðŸ”—</a>Kraig Grady &#x3C;kraiggrady@anaphoria.com&#x3E;</h3><span>6/10/2001 7:06:18 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>J!<br/>    His style is more themmatic/counterpuntal in nature, less interested in  sonic sounds per se.<br/>JI in the hands of Kyle Gann can be quite counterpuntal but often those inclined away from harmony<br/>would not be interested in JI.
