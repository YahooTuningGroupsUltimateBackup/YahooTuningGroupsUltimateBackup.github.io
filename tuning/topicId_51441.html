One of the reasons that Herrmann is regarded so highly is<br/>that his understanding of the traditional orchestra and its repertoire allowed<br/>him to effectively stretch the orchestra in ways that were completely new to<br/>filmgoing audiences. For instance, Herrmann was a master with both Wagnerian<br/>brass choruses (like in Citizen Kane, 1941) and transparent Ravelian textures<br/>(like in Psycho, 1960). Herrmann also brought usually ignored instruments to the<br/>forefront. Extensive use of the vibraphone is a distinctive mark of the<br/>&quot;Herrmann style,&quot; and is particularly prominent in Fahrenheit 451 and Vertigo<br/>(1958). In The Day the Earth Stood Still, Herrmann uses the wailing, imprecise<br/>effects of the theremin, and in Taxi Driver (1976), Herrmann&rsquo;s last film, a<br/>saxophone wail comprises film&rsquo;s main theme.</p><p>    While the orchestra remains a traditional Hollywood and sf film staple,<br/>science fiction has been a breeding ground for experimentation in synthesized<br/>sounds. The 1956 film Forbidden Planet, the first with an all-electronic score,<br/>used sounds recorded from special circuits. The invention of the Moog<br/>synthesizer in 1964, with its keyboard interface, made electronic scoring and<br/>performing much easier for musicians used to the piano. Consequently, synthesized<br/>sound exploded on to the cinematic scene, particularly in movies that evoked<br/>strange, menacing, or ethereal moods. A Clockwork Orange (1971) featured a<br/>mostly-Moog score, and composers like Vangelis, Ryuichi Sakamoto, and Phillip Glass<br/>began to use electronics in their film scoring.</p><p>    Though electronic instruments are certainly capable of creating eerie<br/>sounds that &quot;match&quot; with the eerie moods and settings of science fiction films, I<br/>think that one of the most effective ways to create aural bewilderment is to<br/>create strange sounds with unexpected combinations of familiar instruments.<br/>This technique is a reason why the killing theme in Psycho is SO unforgettable.<br/>In that film, Bernard Herrmann used screeching violins, but I think this<br/>technique can be taken a step further through the use of the most familiar<br/>instrument, the human voice. There are certain aural expectations for the voice, but<br/>when these expectations are deliberately skewed, I think the result can be<br/>chilling. One of my favorite cinematic musical moments is the scene in 2001: A<br/>Space Odyssey where the man-apes first discover the monolith. Without the music,<br/>the scene is made ridiculous: it&rsquo;s just a bunch of monkey-suited men jumping<br/>around a stone slab. However, for me, this scene is one of the most frightening<br/>of all the scenes of al the films I&rsquo;ve seen&ndash;mainly because Gyorgy Ligeti&rsquo;s<br/>choral work   Atmospheres gives the scene its menacingly transcendent quality.<br/>If Kubrick had chosen an orchestra or electronic instrument to accompany this<br/>scene, it would have lost some of its effectiveness, for it is a scene that<br/>emphasizes on the raw, animalistic side of human ancestry. The homo sapiens<br/>voice, the rawest of musical raw materials, is used in Atmospheres to convey both<br/>this rawness and an omen of the strange fate of man.</p><p>    Another aural technique that is very effective in conveying science<br/>fiction strangeness is the use of silence. It seems to me that while many foreign<br/>directors understand this technique, most American directors (Kubrick and a few<br/>others aside) DO NOT UNDERSTAND THE USE OF AURAL RESTRAINT! This<br/>over-busyness and lack of restraint has bled into film trailers, where practically the<br/>whole movie (plot, noisy score, sound effects, and all) is revealed in the space<br/>of two minutes. Another reason that 2001 was so effective was that Kubrick<br/>understood where tension would best mount through the use of silence. Part of the<br/>impact of the conflict between HAL and Dave Bowman was their isolation--<br/>bringing an implied third presence (through music) would have diminished the<br/>intensity of their isolation. I applaud Kubrick for being one of the few directors<br/>that thinks about film music as he uses it!</p><p>    A final feminist note: In reading about electronic scores, it seems that<br/>women play a large role in the development of electronica, and that the<br/>electronic movement was a vehicle to help women come to modern musical prominence.<br/>Bebe Barron, the female half of the husband/wife team who composed the score<br/>for Forbidden Planet, is one of the earliest female film composers. Walter<br/>Carlos composed the score for A Clockwork Orange, but since then, he&rsquo;s gotten a sex<br/>change and is now a woman named Wendy. Anne Dudley, one of the founding<br/>members of my favorite electronica group The Art of Noise, won an Oscar for her<br/>score to The Full Monty (1997). Finally, the largest world prize for Electronic<br/>Music&ndash;it goes by some French name that escapes me right now&ndash;has had very many<br/>women winners.</p><p>---|-----|--------|-------------|---------------------|<br/>Hanuman Zhang, musical mad scientist<br/>&quot;Space is a practiced place.&quot; -- Michel de Certeau<br/>&quot;Space is the Place for the Human Race.&quot; -- William S.
