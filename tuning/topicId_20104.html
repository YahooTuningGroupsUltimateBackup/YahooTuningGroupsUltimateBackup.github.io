(I&apos;m rounding off, the<br/>major/minor thirds and 6ths are off  by 14 and 16 cent intervals, but<br/>I don&apos;t remember which is which.)</p><p>But with diads involving say, the just major 3rd, this requires an 85<br/>cent bend up from the m3. Not a problem on elec guitar, but<br/>problematic for double course instruments such as octave mandolin.<br/>But I could leave the major 3rd alone and bend the other interval up<br/>15 cents  (R- M3, M3-R, M3-5th) so that the two notes are consonant<br/>together, but now I&apos;ve pushed the R or the 5th out-of-tune in<br/>relation to the root of the chord I&apos;m playing over.</p><p>Solo, I think I&apos;d rather have consonant diads (of longer held note<br/>lengths) both 15cents sharp rather than having the R/5th &quot;in&quot; and the<br/>mjor 3rd &quot;out&quot;.</p><p>Any comments about which is preferable?  (I know bending the minor<br/>3rd up to a just M3 would the best option, when &quot;possible&quot;)</p><p>B Knox</p></div>
