padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>&gt;De : Sarn Richard Ursell &lt;<a href="mailto:thcdelta@ihug.co.nz">thcdelta@ihug.co.nz</a>&gt;</p><p>&gt;Why does the music industry use ADDITIVE SYNTHESIS?</p><p>No commercial synthesizers I am aware of use additive synthesis in its most<br/>basic form -- that is, each partial of a desired wave being represented by<br/>an independent envelope and sine wave oscillator. Despite the obvious power<br/>of such an approach, it suffers from two disadvantages that commercial<br/>companies have been reluctant to tackle: first that it is very expensive,<br/>second that people usually don&apos;t know these details about a sound they want<br/>to produce. Additive synthesis is sometimes used by computer music<br/>composers (notably Jean Claude Risset) and can be easily implemented in<br/>languages such as Csound.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;I mean, I realise fully that it is possible, and is conventionally used for<br/>&gt;us to add two waveforms, with repect to time, to give us a more complex<br/>&gt;waveform, but I got to woundering, why not MULTIPLY them?</p><p>Multiplying two wave forms is called ring modulation. It was a standard way<br/>of achieving non-harmonic timbres such as bells in analog days and<br/>cross-synthesis as in many works of Stockhausen. It results in sum and<br/>difference tones between the carrier and modulator, though the frequency of<br/>the carrier disappears.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;We could tehn take the square root of this, giving a GEOMETRICAL AVERAGE,<br/>&gt;and I have conventiently called this &quot;MULTIPLICATIVE SYNTHESIS&quot;.</p><p>Taking the root or exponentiating a wave results in what is called<br/>waveshaping or non-linear distortion synthesis. The Casio CZ/VZ<br/>synthesizers were based on this, though one can implement it in other<br/>synths today, such as the Kurzweil K2x00 series. Its disadvantages include<br/>the inability to generate non-harmonic partials and the difficulty of<br/>predicting the spectrum of other amplitude inputs to a given system.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;Of course, we can, and will end up with imaginary numbers, but then I got to<br/>&gt;thinking, why not just reverse these waveforms and make them negative?<br/>&gt;<br/>This means inverting the phase. Essentially, ring modulation is a form of<br/>amplitude modulation in which this happens, since the carrier is multiplied<br/>by the negative part of the modulator half the time.</p><p>&gt;We could go on to EXPONENTIONAL SYNTHESIS, and take the &quot;QUIGGLE ROOT&quot;, or<br/>&gt;&quot;SUPER-ROOT&quot;.</p><p>I&apos;m not sure what these mean, but they appear to be forms of distortion<br/>synthesis, which have been well researched in the literature, beginning<br/>with radio theory in the 1920s. While the computer music community would<br/>welcome new synthesis methods, most research comes from the standpoint of<br/>trying to find ways to efficiently create a desired waveform and its<br/>changes, less often &quot;what would happen if...&quot; sorts of experiments.</p><p>&gt;I long for the day in which we can change the ACTUAL MATHEMATICS involved in<br/>&gt;a physical modeling system,-you will, no doubt make some sort of parallel<br/>&gt;with this and my hypothesis on &quot;The Polyverse&quot;.</p><p>I&apos;m not sure what you mean, but physical modeling is a hot topic in<br/>computer music and PM synths are widely available. They are most flexible<br/>in Csound and like languages, and, of course, there is nothing preventing<br/>you from implementing new PM mathematics from scratch in such a language.<br/>Such instruments are posted on the Csound list from time to time.</p><p>&gt;Finally, could we not do ADDITIVE SYNTHESIS, GEOMETRICAL SYNTHESIS,<br/>&gt;EXPONENTIONAL SUYNTHESIS, SUPER-EXPONENTIONAL SYNTHESIS,<br/>&gt;SUPER-DUPER-EXPONENTIONAL SYNTHESIS on guitar strings?</p><p>If you mean distort guitar sounds in various ways, sure.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;We could experiment with a feedback type system of recording, and useing<br/>&gt;these different orders of operations to average the playing guitar strings,<br/>&gt;and I feel that somehow, with REALLY high operators, where we can hace<br/>&gt;c(cc), and (cc)c, where &quot;c&quot;=Catalan, we may get some really beautiful<br/>&gt;sounds.</p><p>If by &quot;beautiful sounds&quot; you mean distorted to amplify upper partials (in<br/>the case of waveshaping), bell-like non-harmonic sounds (in the case of<br/>ring modulation), or mixing with some other source (which is I assume what<br/>you mean by &quot;additive synthesis&quot; in this context) then sure. By all means<br/>go for it.</p><p>To find out more about ring modulation, waveshaping, and other forms of<br/>distortion synthesis and physical modeling, I would recommend a good<br/>computer music text. I use Dodge and Jerse _Computer Music_ (2nd edition,<br/>Schirmer), but there are other good ones. By the way, the MIT press book on<br/>Csound is due out in January. In it I have a chapter on implementing<br/>alternate tunings.</p><p>Bill</p><p>^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^<br/>^ Bill Alves                                      email: <a href="mailto:alves@hmc.edu">alves@hmc.edu</a> ^<br/>^ Harvey Mudd College                 URL: <a href="http://www2.hmc.edu/~alves/">http://www2.hmc.edu/~alves/</a> ^<br/>^ 301 E.
