This will<br/>be a valuable resource for many people, I am sure.</p><p>&gt; For now, I&apos;ve done all the pages with meta tags telling<br/>&gt; the search engines not to index them.

It<br/>certainly doesn&apos;t bother *me* any.  I think everybody knows that what<br/>is said over the Internet is pretty much *public* information,<br/>anyway, and, in fact, most people know that that situation even<br/>pertains to &quot;private&quot; e-mail in the hands of even moderately inept<br/>hackers...</p><p>&gt; The Mills archive still needs a little more work<br/>&gt; - that is a separate kind of thing as the posts need<br/>&gt; to be extracted from files rather than downloaded<br/>&gt; from a web site. I think not that much left to do,<br/>&gt; may be a few hard to avoid glitches in the final result<br/>&gt; but it will be usable anyway.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; The complete archive is going to be in the region<br/>&gt; of 200 Mb of html, so far too large for the 50 Mb<br/>&gt; available on a tripod site.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Compressed into zips it may be okay, more like<br/>&gt; 20-30 Mb size, so I&apos;m thinking of uploading it as<br/>&gt; several zips at 4 Mb or so each, which have to all<br/>&gt; be downloaded and then extracted into the same folder<br/>&gt; to make the archive.

It will be fun to<br/>browse through those *old* Mills posts to see how people have changed<br/>over the years...  Personally, I think I&apos;ve learned something in the<br/>two years on this list, although that opinion may not be unanimous.</p><p>Thanks again!</p><p>Joseph</p></div>
