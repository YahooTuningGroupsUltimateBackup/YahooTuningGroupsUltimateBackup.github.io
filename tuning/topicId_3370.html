Or even a trip to<br/>&gt; the library wouldn&apos;t dig up?</p><p> Primarily, a comprehensive collection of lattice diagrams<br/> illustrating historical tuning systems and harmonic gestures,<br/> from c. 400 BC to 1999 AD, along with my prime-factor adaptation<br/> of regular staff-notation to notate these systems.</p><p> Partch and Helmholtz devote a lot of space to experimental<br/> investigations and other aspects of acoustics and composition<br/> which are not specifically descriptive of tuning *systems*.<br/> For instance, Helmholtz describes his experiemental apparatus<br/> and Partch describes his instruements and the dramatic aspects<br/> of his compositions, all of this in great detail.  And Partch&apos;s<br/> primary concern was with his own single ~43-tone system of<br/> Monophony.</p><p> Doty&apos;s book is intentionally limited in scope to suit beginners,<br/> and, altho still quite extensive (and very good), doesn&apos;t cover<br/> anywhere near as many *specific* tuning systems as my book.</p><p> None of them give analyses of specific pieces or gestures<br/> (with the two exceptions of Partch&apos;s &apos;modulation&apos; and<br/> &apos;tonality flux&apos; explanations), which I do.</p><p> This last point is especially important.  As many of us here<br/> have argued, theory divorced from actual music is rather pointless.<br/> (Boethius&apos;s opinion notwithstanding).  Partch certainly emphasizes<br/> that fact, but he still doesn&apos;t give analyses of his harmonic<br/> practice, except the very sketchy examples of &apos;tonality flux&apos;<br/> mentioned above.</p><p> As far as a trip to the library:  if you live in or near<br/> New York (as you do), go for it - there&apos;s a lot there.</p><p> But away from New York, I&apos;ve had a *LOT* of difficulty finding<br/> the information I was researching, even in large cities like<br/> Philadelphia (surprisingly, especially considering all the<br/> good university libraries here), Phoenix (even with a brand new<br/> and very good central library), and San Diego (LOL here).</p><p> On that last point, I find it shameful that the city where both<br/> Partch and Darreg spent the last years of their lives has such a<br/> poor representation in its libraries of anything concerned with<br/> their work (or of anything, period, for that matter).</p><p> And belive me, I&apos;ve gotten out the earth-moving equipment to<br/> do some serious digging.  People living in more rural areas will<br/> generally have even greater difficulty.</p><p> I know that for a lot of New Yorkers, the universe ends at<br/> the Hudson River, or perhaps somewhere in New Jersey and Long<br/> Island.  But lots of microtonal folks live out here in the<br/> hinterlands, and I suppose we suffer accordingly.</p><p> OK, enough ranting about libraries...</p><p> Besides, my particular lattice design, which is different<br/> from all the others, isn&apos;t available anywhere else, except<br/> on my website, and here on this List.</p><p> Much of the historical information in my book is based on the<br/> systems analyzed by those three authors, but my objective<br/> was to diagram those ratios all from the same &apos;perspective&apos;<br/> (i.e., from the same 1/1), to gain an understanding of how<br/> the different systems _in toto_ relate to each other.</p><p> In addition, there is much new information added stemming from<br/> Barbour, _Journal of Music Theory_, _Perspectives of New Music_,<br/> _Xenharmonikon_, and from my own interaction and correspondence<br/> with contemporary theorists and composers.</p><p> I&apos;ve also been able to take advantage of several recent<br/> English translations of such classic treatises as those of<br/> Aristoxenus, _sectio canonis_, Nicomachus, Ptolemy, Boethius,<br/> _musica enchiriadis_, Hucbald, Guido d&apos;Arezzo, Marchetto,<br/> Prosdocimus, Zarlino, Riemann, and Schoenberg.</p><p> (In particular, I&apos;ve gathered so much information about<br/> Schoenberg that I&apos;ve decided to write an entire second book<br/> exploring in more detail his theories and the work of his<br/> students and predecessors - which is only natural, since I<br/> admire Mahler so much, and I dig Webern a lot too.)</p><p> The book grew out of my frustration in dealing with ratios<br/> of very large numbers in Partch and Helmholtz, and most of it<br/> was finished before I ever saw Doty&apos;s book, which does have a<br/> fair amount of the same information (in particular, his use<br/> of lattices, which are, however, a bit different from mine).</p><p> Another thing you won&apos;t find anywhere else (except my website):<br/> I have a few very speculative theories on possible examples<br/> of higher-prime systems at earlier dates than those usually<br/> cited - readers of this list will already be aware of these<br/> (one example is that of Boethius which I just mentioned yesterday,<br/> another is Marchetto of Padua).</p><p> In addition, I explore blues and rock music styles (for example,<br/> Louis Armstrong, Robert Johnson, Etta James, Jimi Hendrix) which,<br/> to my knowledge, have never been subject to extensive microtonal<br/> analysis before, excepting Sims&apos;s work on Armstrong. (Note that<br/> all these artists were African-American, which may or may not be<br/> significant - at any rate, there&apos;s certainly a gap in the<br/> understanding of microtones in African-American music, which<br/> I hope to fill at least partially.)</p><p> Also, the work of several contemporary composers and theorists<br/> - for example, Erv Wilson, Ben Johnston, Lou Harrison, Ezra Sims,<br/> Terry Riley, Johnny Reinhard, Denny Genovese, Sasha Bogdanowitsch,<br/> David Beardsley :) - is included, which obviously was impossible<br/> for Helmholtz and Partch, and which lie outside the scope of Doty&apos;s<br/> introductory _Primer_.</p><p> To a large extent, the differences may be summed up with the<br/> statement that Partch and Helmholtz argued polemically in favor<br/> of their JI or tempered systems, and Doty explains and illustrates<br/> more-or-less basic concepts and ends there, whereas I&apos;ve assumed<br/> what all three of them said as given, expanded from there,<br/> and tried to find underlying principles of unification.</p><p> Joseph L.

This is an excerpt from H.H.<br/>Stuckenschmidt&apos;s &quot;Twentieth Century Music&quot; (pages 91 &amp; 92):</p><p>&#x9;&quot;...the Viennese composer Josef Matthias Hauer (1883-1959) &#x9;probably wrote<br/>&apos;purely atonal melodies&apos; before Schoenberg and &#x9;his pupils. The earliest of<br/>them date from piano pieces of &#x9;1914. The pieces, in fact, are complete<br/>forms built up from &#x9;purely atonal melodies of this kind. Hauer describes<br/>his aims &#x9;in a text-book on atonal music, entitled _On the Nature of<br/>&#x9;Music_, which was published in 1920. He starts from a notion &#x9;of &apos;equal<br/>temperament&apos;, that is, a chromatic technique which &#x9;uses mathematical<br/>procedures to combat the tendency of a &#x9;tonic to become established. He<br/>characterizes the music he &#x9;advocates as follows:</p><p>&#x9;&#x9;In atonal music, however, which stems from &apos;totalities&apos;,    &#x9;&#x9;intervals<br/>alone are relevant. Musical expression is no &#x9;&#x9;longer achieved through the<br/>use of major and minor keys &#x9;&#x9;and of specific instruments with a _single_<br/>timbre: it &#x9;&#x9;is founded on the totality of intervals and timbres, and &#x9;&#x9;is<br/>best and most clearly realized by using one single, &#x9;&#x9;tempered instrument.</p><p>&#x9;He says further on:</p><p>&#x9;&#x9;The &apos;law&apos; or &apos;nomos&apos; [of atonal music] is that _all &#x9;&#x9;&#x9;twelve notes_ of<br/>the temperament are to be repeated &#x9;&#x9;&#x9;over and over again.</p><p>&#x9;Undoubtedly Hauer preceded the Schoenberg school in calling &#x9;for and<br/>employing all twelve notes of the melos. However, the &#x9;idea was certainly<br/>in the air at the time.&quot;</p><p>Though I&apos;ve never heard any of Hauer&apos;s music, nor seen his book mentioned<br/>in this quote (nor do I &apos;vouch&apos; for any of the above), it all certainly did<br/>catch my attention when I read it, so I thought I&apos;d pass it along...</p><p>Dan</p></div>
