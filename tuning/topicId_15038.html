However, a text-based<br/>article can, at least, communicate some of the musical concepts<br/>involved, and invite readers to try the examples on suitably tuned<br/>instruments, or maybe even to prepare digitized versions of some of<br/>the progressions and tunings.</p><p>Please let me emphasize that while many of the concepts here have<br/>precedents in 13th-14th century European practice and theory, this is<br/>an explanation in the year 2000 of an approach at once old and new.</p><p>In what follows, I use the English term &quot;quad&quot; to refer to any<br/>four-voice sonority, and likewise &quot;triple&quot; for any three-voice<br/>sonority. My main intention is to avoid the possible implication of<br/>stability which the terms &quot;tetrad&quot; and &quot;triad&quot; may carry for some<br/>readers. In 13th-century parlance, a _triplum_ refers to a third voice<br/>or three-voice piece, and likewise a _quadruplum_ to a fourth voice or<br/>four-voice piece.</p><p>From a xenharmonic perspective, one notable feature of neo-Gothic<br/>music is the wide range of sizes or &quot;flavors&quot; for certain unstable<br/>intervals, sometimes within the same tuning system and piece,<br/>especially in cadential progressions.</p><p>A &quot;major third&quot; expanding to a fifth, for example, may range from<br/>around 363 cents (a bit narrower than 21:17) to around 455 cents<br/>(~13:10), a range of over 90 cents. Likewise, a &quot;minor third&quot;<br/>contracting to a unison may range from around 248 cents (~15:13) to<br/>around 341 cents (somewhat larger than 17:14).[1]</p><p>This first article, posted in two part, introduces some of the main<br/>unstable cadential sonorities, especially the family known as &quot;most<br/>proximate&quot; quads and triples, and surveys some of the principal<br/>intonational shadings or &quot;flavors&quot; these sonorities may assume.</p><p>Future installments will explore in more detail these flavors, offered<br/>in various combinations and fine nuances by different neo-Gothic<br/>tuning systems.</p><p>Concern for the important distinction between Gothic and neo-Gothic<br/>practice and theory bids me add that while the following &quot;modernistic&quot;<br/>presentation starts with four-voice progressions, a more &quot;medievalist&quot;<br/>approach would start with two-voice resolutions, moving from there to<br/>three-voice and four-voice cadences.</p><p>Also, while resolutions of four-voice &quot;quads&quot; as described below do<br/>occur in 13th-century compositions, the three-voice subsets of these<br/>sonorities and resolutions described in Part II of this article are<br/>more typical of 13th-14th century practice, where three-voice writing<br/>is the norm.</p><p>For an introduction to historical 13th-century practice proceeding<br/>from two-voice intervals to multi-voice structures and progressions,<br/>readers are invited to visit my presentation kindly hosted by Todd<br/>McComb of the Medieval Music and Arts Foundation:</p><p><a href="http://www.medieval.org/emfaq/harmony/13c.html">http://www.medieval.org/emfaq/harmony/13c.html</a></p><p>---------------------------------------------------<br/>1. Cadential action: Trines and most proximal quads<br/>---------------------------------------------------</p><p>In Gothic and neo-Gothic music, the complete stable sonority is the<br/>three-voice trine consisting of an outer octave, lower fifth, and<br/>upper fourth.[2] Using a MIDI-style notation with C4 as middle C and<br/>higher numbers showing higher octaves, an example of a trine would be<br/>D3-A3-D4 or F3-C4-F4.</p><p>As realized in 3-limit just intonation (JI), also known as Pythagorean<br/>tuning, the trine has pure interval ratios of 2:3:4, with a 2:3 fifth<br/>below and a 3:4 fourth above together forming a 2:4 (or 1:2) octave.<br/>Other Neo-Gothic regular tunings typically feature trines quite close<br/>to these ideal ratios, but with fifths slightly wider than 2:3 and<br/>fourths slightly narrower than 3:4.[3]</p><p>Defining the standard of rich and euphonious stability, the complete<br/>trine serves as an optimal goal for directed resolutions of various<br/>unstable sonorities.</p><p>In an ideally efficient form of four-voice cadence, a trine provides a<br/>restful goal for a moving four-voice sonority known as a &quot;proximal<br/>quad&quot; with four unstable intervals all resolving by stepwise contrary<br/>motion:</p><p>          E4  F4<br/>          D4  C4<br/>          B3  C4<br/>          G3  F3</p><p>(M6-8 + M3-5 + m3-1 + M2-4)</p><p>Here the outer major sixth of the quad expands to the octave of a<br/>complete trine; the lower major third to the fifth of the trine; and<br/>the upper major second to the fourth of the trine. The minor third<br/>between the two middle voices contracts to a unison, both these voices<br/>arriving at the fifth of the trine.</p><p>It&apos;s often convenient to identify a Gothic or neo-Gothic cadence as a<br/>union of such directed two-voice progressions by contrary motion, thus<br/>the shorthand below the example of (M6-8 + M3-5 + m3-1 + M2-4).</p><p>We call this quad &quot;proximal&quot; (i.e. close or neighboring) because its<br/>voices and unstable intervals can all progress to their stable trinic<br/>goal by means of ideally economic stepwise motion. Each voice moves by<br/>step, and each unstable interval resolves by stepwise contrary motion.</p><p>It is further a &quot;_most_ proximal&quot; quad because each of the four<br/>interval resolutions has one voice moving by a whole-tone and the<br/>other by a diatonic semitone: the unstable interval need expand or<br/>contract by only the total distance of a minor third to arrive at a<br/>stable trinic interval (M6-8, M3-5, m3-1, or M2-4).</p><p>Using regular diatonic motions, as opposed to &quot;unusual&quot; intervals such<br/>as the chromatic semitone, these are the most compact and efficient<br/>resolutions possible by contrary motion from an unstable interval to a<br/>stable one.</p><p>This last Gothic and neo-Gothic concept of resolutions to &quot;the nearest<br/>consonance&quot; may become clearer as we look at most proximal quads in<br/>more detail.</p><p>----------------------------------------------------<br/>1.1. Most proximal quads, expansive and contractive<br/>----------------------------------------------------</p><p>Most proximal quads come in two structural varieties: the _expansive_<br/>variety we have just met, with an outer major sixth expanding to the<br/>octave of a complete trine; and a _contractive_ variety with an outer<br/>minor seventh contracting to a simple fifth, the prime trinic concord.<br/>Both varieties feature four voices and four ideally efficient<br/>two-voice resolutions by stepwise contrary motion:</p><p>        Expansive                       Contractive</p><p>          E4  F4                           D4  C4<br/>          D4  C4                           B3  C4<br/>          B3  C4                           G3  F3<br/>          G3  F3                           E3  F3</p><p>(M6-8 + M3-5 + m3-1 + M2-4)      (m7-5 + m3-1 + M3-5 + m3-1)</p><p>Here both quads cadence to the trine F3-C4-F4 or its fifth F3-C4.<br/>While the terms &quot;expansive&quot; and &quot;contractive&quot; refer especially to the<br/>behavior of the _outer_ major sixth or minor seventh (M6-8, m7-5),<br/>more generally they describe the pattern followed by the majority of<br/>intervals in each form.</p><p>Thus the resolution of the expansive most proximal quad features three<br/>two-voice resolutions by expansion (M6-8, M3-5, M2-4), and one by<br/>contraction (m3-1):</p><p>   Expansive resolutions         Contractive resolution</p><p>E4  F4    B3  C4    E4  F4               D4  C4<br/>G3  F3    G3  F3    D4  C4               B3  C4</p><p>(M6-8)    (M3-5)    (M2-4)               (m3-1)</p><p>The resolution of the contractive most proximal quad likewise involves<br/>three two-voice resolutions by contraction (m7-5, m3-1, m3-1) -- the<br/>minor thirds E3-G3 and B3-D4 both progressing to unisons -- and one by<br/>expansion (M3-5):</p><p>  Contractive resolutions          Expansive resolution</p><p>D4  C4    G3  F3    D4  C4               B3  C4<br/>E3  F3    E3  F3    B3  C4               G3  F3</p><p>(m7-5)    (m3-1)    (m3-1)               (M3-5)</p><p>People who enjoy symmetrical patterns may take pleasure in noting that<br/>the middle voices of an expansive most proximate quad form the<br/>unstable interval which contracts (m3-1), while these same voices in<br/>our contractive quad form the unstable interval which expands (M3-5).</p><p>Each quad features four of the five most important two-voice<br/>resolutions to &quot;the nearest consonance,&quot; or &quot;closest approach&quot;<br/>progressions as they are sometimes termed in medieval and neo-Gothic<br/>theory: M2-4, M3-5, and M6-8 (by expansion) and m3-1 and m7-5 (by<br/>contraction).</p><p>From the viewpoint of vertical color, most proximate quads are<br/>impressively active and dynamic but not intensely &quot;dissonant,&quot; since<br/>all of their intervals are to some degree &quot;compatible.&quot; Major and<br/>minor thirds are regarded in 13th-century theory as relatively<br/>&quot;concordant&quot; or blending, although unstable; major seconds, minor<br/>sevenths, and major sixths, while regarded as relatively tense, are<br/>also accorded some &quot;compatibility.&quot;</p><p>As we&apos;ll see (Section 3), there are also &quot;crunchier&quot; flavors of<br/>proximate quads featuring strong dissonances such as minor seconds or<br/>major sevenths, or augmented fourths or diminished fifths. For the<br/>moment, however, keeping to the theme of most proximal quads and their<br/>resolutions, let&apos;s focus on another and more contextual distinction<br/>and introduce the vital topic of _intonation_.</p><p>----------------------------------------------------------<br/>1.2. Intensive and remissive manners in Pythagorean tuning<br/>----------------------------------------------------------</p><p>Most proximate quads of the expansive and contractive varieties can be<br/>recognized by their intrinsic structure: G3-B3-D4-E4 is an expansive<br/>quad inviting (M6-8 + M3-5 + m3-1 + M2-4), while E3-G3-B3-D4 is a<br/>contractive quad inviting (m7-5 + m3-1 + M3-5 + m3-1).</p><p>Since this is a &quot;gentle introduction,&quot; and many readers may be used to<br/>reckoning intervals in terms of the lowest voice, we might<br/>conveniently describe the expansive quad as having a major third,<br/>fifth, and major sixth above this voice. The contractive quad has a<br/>minor third, fifth, and minor seventh above the lowest voice.</p><p>For many readers, another &quot;user-friendly&quot; way of expressing these same<br/>sonorities is in terms of intervals in cents above the lowest voice.<br/>In a standard medieval Pythagorean tuning, we have an expansive quad<br/>at a rounded 0-408-702-906, and a contractive quad at 0-294-702-996.</p><p>While the distinction between the expansive and contractive quads is<br/>one of intrinsic structure, either type of quad may resolve in two<br/>_manners_ depending on the musical context.</p><p>In the _intensive_ manner, all four unstable intervals resolve by<br/>progressions involving descending whole-tone motion in one voice and<br/>ascending semitonal motion in the other. In the _remissive_ manner,<br/>conversely, all four of these resolutions involve ascending whole-tone<br/>motion and descending semitonal motion.</p><p>Comparing these resolutions for our quads G3-B3-D4-E4 and E3-G3-B3-D4<br/>may make the distinction more clear:</p><p>                     Intensive manner</p><p>         Expansive                       Contractive</p><p>          E4  F4                           D4  C4<br/>          D4  C4                           B3  C4<br/>          B3  C4                           G3  F3<br/>          G3  F3                           E3  F3</p><p>(M6-8 + M3-5 + m3-1 + M2-4)      (m7-5 + m3-1 + M3-5 + m3-1)</p><p>                      Remissive manner</p><p>         Expansive                       Contractive</p><p>          E4  F#4                           D4  C#4<br/>          D4  C#4                           B3  C#4<br/>          B3  C#4                           G3  F#3<br/>          G3  F#3                           E3  F#3</p><p>(M6-8 + M3-5 + m3-1 + M2-4)      (m7-5 + m3-1 + M3-5 + m3-1)</p><p>Our two intensive resolutions to a trine or fifth on F are in fact<br/>identical to those of Section 1.1, and the reader may refer to the<br/>listings of their two-voice progressions in that section in order to<br/>confirm that each of these progressions involves ascending semitonal<br/>motion in one voice and descending whole-tone motion in the other.</p><p>For our two remissive resolutions of these same quads to a trine or<br/>fifth on F#, a similar listing will confirm the converse pattern of<br/>descending semitonal motion and ascending whole-tone motion:</p><p>Expansive quad/Remissive manner    Contractive quad/Remissive manner</p><p>E4 F#4  B3 F#3  E4 F#4  D4 C#4     D4 F#4  G3 F#3  D4 C#4  B3 C#4<br/>G3 F#3  G3 F#3  D4 C#4  B3 C#4     E3 F#3  E3 F#3  B4 C#4  G3 F#3</p><p>(M6-8)  (M3-5)  (M2-4)  (m3-1)     (m7-5)  (m3-1)  (m3-1)  (M3-5)</p><p>The terms &quot;intensive&quot; and &quot;remissive&quot; derive from medieval Latin<br/>descriptions of ascending and descending motion, and these terms may<br/>nicely convey some of the musical qualities of these two manners of<br/>resolution.</p><p>The intensive manner with its ascending semitonal motion tends to be<br/>more decisive and definitive, while the remissive manner with its<br/>descending semitonal motion may have a more &quot;relaxed&quot; and open-ended<br/>quality, more &quot;laid back&quot; as one might say in colloquial English.</p><p>As illustrated in our last example, a given most proximal quad offers<br/>two alternative resolutions by ideally efficient cadential motion, one<br/>in the intensive manner and one in the remissive manner.</p><p>Here is another example illustrating this choice for the quad<br/>F3-A3-C4-D4 or D3-F3-A3-C4, this time showing first the more common<br/>remissive resolution to a trine or fifth on E, and then the more<br/>&quot;remote&quot; intensive resolution to a trine or fifth on Eb:</p><p>       Expansive quad                 Contractive quad</p><p> Remissive     Intensive          Remissive     Intensive</p><p>  D4  E3        D4  Eb3            C4  B3        C4  Bb3<br/>  C4  B3        C4  Bb3            A3  B3        A3  Bb3<br/>  A3  B3        A3  Bb3            F3  E3        F3  Eb3<br/>  F3  E3        F3  Eb3            D3  E3        D3  Eb3</p><p>Just as a given most proximal quad may regularly resolve to either of<br/>two stable trines or fifths, so a given trine or fifth may be<br/>approached by regular cadences from either of two most proximal quads,<br/>one resolving intensively and the other remissively.

For an example involving more remote accidentals, let us<br/>consider the usual intensive cadence and more &quot;remote&quot; remissive<br/>cadence to the trine F3-C4-F4 or fifth F3-C4:</p><p>   Intensive cadences to F         Remissive cadences to F</p><p>  Expansive     Contractive       Expansive     Contractive</p><p>   E4  F4        D3  C4            Eb4  F4        Db3  C4<br/>   D4  C4        B3  C4            Db4  C4        Bb3  C4<br/>   B3  C4        G3  F3            Bb3  C4        Gb3  F3<br/>   G3  F3        E3  F3            Gb3  F3        Eb3  F3</p><p>A 17-note Pythagorean tuning of Gb-A#, or an equivalent tuning in a<br/>neo-Gothic temperament, would provide all the accidentals needed for a<br/>regular remissive cadence to F, as would smaller tunings such as the<br/>15-note subset Gb-G# or the 12-note subset Gb-B.</p><p>More generally, _any_ trine or fifth may be regularly approached in<br/>either an intensive or a remissive manner, as long as our gamut<br/>provides the requisite accidentals.[4]</p><p>Having become acquainted with these intensive and remissive<br/>progressions, let us consider their intonation in Pythagorean tuning,<br/>known in neo-Gothic theory as the &quot;3-flavor.&quot;</p><p>As we shall see in the next section, the concept of &quot;flavor&quot; applies<br/>to _unstable_ sonorities and intervals, as opposed to stable intervals<br/>and trines which quite closely approximate the ideal ratios of 2:3:4<br/>over the usual range of neo-Gothic tunings.</p><p>More specifically, &quot;flavor&quot; focuses mainly on different nuances and<br/>shadings for the unstable intervals of the expansive and contractive<br/>most proximal quads: M2, m3, M3, M6, and m7. The concept tends to<br/>center especially on such intonational variations for M3, m3, and M6,<br/>somewhat more sensitive to small changes in fifth size than M2 and m7,<br/>but with the latter intervals also playing a vital role in larger<br/>changes of flavor.</p><p>In the &quot;3-flavor&quot; ideally realized by Pythagorean tuning, these<br/>intervals have or approximate integer ratios based on powers of three:<br/>M3 at 81:64 (~408 cents); m3 at 32:27 (~294 cents); M6 at 27:16 (~906<br/>cents); M2 at 9:8 (~204 cents); and m7 at 16:9 (~996 cents).</p><p>Additionally, the &quot;flavor&quot; concept focuses on the melodic dimension of<br/>tuning, and especially on variations in the size of whole-tones and<br/>semitones in cadential and other settings. In Pythagorean, the melodic<br/>whole-tone or major second has the same pure 9:8 ratio we just noted<br/>in a vertical context (~204 cents), while the diatonic semitone or<br/>limma has a size of 256:243 (~90 cents).</p><p>The following diagrams show both vertical and melodic intervals in the<br/>Pythagorean &quot;3-flavor&quot; for intensive and remissive progressions from a<br/>most proximate quad to a trine or fifth.

The lowest note G3 of the expansive quad, for example,<br/>has intervals of (906,702,408) cents, or (M6,5,M3), with the three<br/>upper voices at E4, D4, and B3 respectively. The next voice at B3 has<br/>intervals of (498,294) cents or (4,m3) with the remaining higher<br/>voices at E4 and D4; and the next voice at D4 has an interval of (204)<br/>cents or (M2) with the remaining highest voice at E4.[5]</p><p>These cadences in the 3-flavor may bring out some general qualities of<br/>Gothic and neo-Gothic music. Thirds and sixths have a relatively<br/>complex quality, one nicely fitting their role as unstable and often<br/>cadentially directed intervals. At the same time, there is a<br/>satisfying contrast between wide 204-cent whole-tones and compact<br/>90-cent diatonic semitones.</p><p>A measure of cadential efficiency bringing both dimensions into play<br/>is the total distance an unstable interval must expand or contract in<br/>order to arrive at its stable goal. As the above example shows for<br/>various cadential permutations, in the Pythagorean 3-flavor each<br/>unstable interval resolves by motions of a 204-cent whole-tone in one<br/>voice and a 90-cent diatonic semitone in the other -- a total<br/>expansion or contraction, as the case may be, of 294 cents, or a 32:27<br/>minor third.</p><p>Neo-Gothic tunings in the immediate neighborhood of Pythagorean, for<br/>example 53-tone equal temperament or 53-tET (fifths ~0.07 cents<br/>narrow), or 41-tET (fifths ~0.48 cents wide), present unstable<br/>interval sizes and melodic steps very close to those shown above, and<br/>so may be regarded as offering fine variations on this basic<br/>&quot;3-flavor.&quot;</p><p>Other neo-Gothic intonational regions or flavors offer different<br/>musical qualities based on the interplay of such variables as the<br/>degree of &quot;complexity&quot; or tension in unstable intervals, the sizes and<br/>relative proportions of melodic whole-tones and semitones, and the<br/>amount of expansion or contraction involved in two-voice resolutions.</p><p>Further, a single neo-Gothic tuning system typically may offer two or<br/>three contrasting cadential flavors, one motivation for carrying a<br/>tuning beyond 12 notes so as to enjoy a choice of these flavors at<br/>various positions of the gamut.</p><p>To illustrate these points, we next compare the 3-flavor with some<br/>other common flavors for most proximal quads.</p><p>---------------<br/>Notes to Part I<br/>---------------</p><p>1. This is by no means to exclude &quot;neutral thirds,&quot; which occur for<br/>example in 17-tone equal temperament (17-tET).</p><p>2. Johannes de Grocheio (c. 1300) describes this sonority as<br/>manifesting the _trina harmoniae perfectio_ or &quot;threefold perfection<br/>of harmony,&quot; thus from this Latin the English &quot;trine.&quot;</p><p>3. The most characteristic or &quot;Central&quot; zone of neo-Gothic regular<br/>temperaments moves outward from Pythagorean to 17-tET, where fifths<br/>are about 3.93 cents wide; the &quot;Far&quot; neo-Gothic zone ranges out from<br/>there to around 22-tET (fifths ~7.14 cents wide), or for some<br/>&quot;Setharianized&quot; (e.g. gamelan-like) timbres to around 27-tET (fifths<br/>~9.16 cents wide).</p><p>4. This is by no means to exclude the additional option of altered<br/>progressions: for example, substituting F#3-Bb3-C#4-D#4 for the<br/>regular expansive quad Gb3-Bb3-Db4-Eb4 in a cadence to F3-C4-F4.<br/>Such substitutions result in melodic motions replacing diatonic<br/>semitones with chromatic ones (e.g. F#3-F3 in place of Gb3-F3, etc.),<br/>and augmented or diminished vertical intervals in place of usual ones<br/>(e.g. the augmented third Bb3-D#4 in place of the fourth Bb3-Eb4). The<br/>musical effect can sometimes be delightful. In certain neo-Gothic<br/>temperaments, for example, the augmented third Bb3-D#4 will<br/>approximate 11:8 (~551.32 cents), aptly styled a &quot;superfourth&quot; by<br/>David Keenan, giving cadential resolutions a special beauty.</p><p>5. Apart from intonational matters, our diagrams illustrate a general<br/>point which has been left largely implicit. Shifting from an intensive<br/>to a remissive resolution of the same most proximal quad leaves the<br/>sizes of vertical intervals unchanged, but changes the arrangements<br/>and directions of melodic motions, and also the sonority of resolution<br/>(here from F3-C4-F4 or F3-C4 to F#3-C#4-F#4 or F#3-C#4).</p><p>Most respectfully,</p><p>Margo Schulter<br/><a href="mailto:mschulter@value.net">mschulter@value.net</a></p></div><h3><a id=15162 href="#15162">ðŸ”—</a>Robert Walker &#x3C;robert_walker@rcwalker.freeserve.co.uk&#x3E;</h3><span>10/30/2000 4:52:01 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>I&apos;ve done some scores + midi clips for Margo Schulter&apos;s article:</p><p><a href="http://www.robertwalker.f9.co.uk/schulter/ng1_pt_1/ng1_pt1.htm">http://www.robertwalker.f9.co.uk/schulter/ng1_pt_1/ng1_pt1.htm</a></p><p>Robert Walker</p></div><h3><a id=15167 href="#15167">ðŸ”—</a>Joseph Pehrson &#x3C;josephpehrson@compuserve.com&#x3E;</h3><span>10/30/2000 5:13:02 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@egroups.com">tuning@egroups.com</a>, &quot;Robert Walker&quot; &lt;robert_walker@r...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt; I&apos;ve done some scores + midi clips for Margo Schulter&apos;s article:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; <a href="http://www.robertwalker.f9.co.uk/schulter/ng1_pt_1/ng1_pt1.htm">http://www.robertwalker.f9.co.uk/schulter/ng1_pt_1/ng1_pt1.htm</a><br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Robert Walker</p><p>Hi Robert!</p><p>This is INCREDIBLE!
