The following text<br/>for my new piece VIOLAHEXY needs to pass clearance.  Is there<br/>anything egregiously wrong with it??</p><p>Please keep in mind, it is intended for your ABSOLUTELY uninformed<br/>violist... microtonally speaking, that is.</p><p>This is just a little practical question.  If I hear nothing, I&apos;ll<br/>assume I did &quot;OK&quot;</p><p>_________________<br/>VIOLAHEXY, for viola and synthesizer (on audio CD), is written in an<br/>&quot;alternate tuning system,&quot; meaning in a system other than our &quot;usual&quot;<br/>system of 12 tempered pitches per octave.  The basic scale is created<br/>through combining &quot;hexanies&quot; -- 6-note structures made by simple<br/>multiplication of factors.  These hexanies are known as &quot;combination<br/>product sets&quot; or CPSs for short.</p><p>In order to play this piece, one need only read traditional notation<br/>and quartertones (see chart at beginning of piece) with numbers near<br/>the note heads which &quot;adjust&quot; the pitches + or - in cents from the<br/>nearest quartertone.  By traditional definition, there are 100 cents<br/>per semitone, 50 cents per quartertone, and there will never be more<br/>than 25 cents deviation from the nearest quartertone in this system.</p><p>Hexanies create consonant scales.  You will see in the accompanying<br/>chart that several of the ratios found in this scale are in small<br/>integer relationships to the fundamental pitch &quot;C&quot; (261 Hz.) You will<br/>find 3/2, the just perfect fifth, 5/4, the just major third, and 7/4,<br/>the just minor seventh.  Therefore, the music is related to just<br/>intonation, and can be quite consonant.</p><p>THE AUDIO CD:</p><p>In order to facilitate an accurate rendering of this composition, I<br/>have included &quot;practice&quot; tracks on the audio CD which also includes<br/>the synthesizer part that will be played during performance.</p><p>TRACK 1 is a slow ascending scale in this system -- for practice<br/>purposes only.  Note that this scale is &quot;octave equivalent,&quot; meaning<br/>each octave has the same pitch classes as octaves above and below it.<br/>Slow practice of this scale will facilitate hearing the system.</p><p>TRACK 2 is the piece WITH an electronic PRACTICE viola part (NOT FOR<br/>CONCERT).  One may play along with this track for practice in order<br/>to become familiar with the microtonal pitches of the viola part and<br/>with the structure of the piece.</p><p>TRACK 3 is the CONCERT track WITHOUT the practice viola part.  This<br/>track is to be played IN CONCERT WITH the live viola.  Please note<br/>that the viola &quot;cues&quot; from the synthesizer are very simple to<br/>facilitate coordination.</p><p>Above all, enjoy!  VIOLAHEXY, although in an unusual tuning system,<br/>is expressive, and all the traditional nuances of traditional music<br/>making should be brought to it!</p><p>________ ___ __ __<br/>Joseph Pehrson</p></div>
