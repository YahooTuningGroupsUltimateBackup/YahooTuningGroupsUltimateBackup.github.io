It&apos;s the same picture of the rational<br/>numbers that Hardy and Wright use in one of their three proofs of the basic<br/>identity for adjacent ratios in a Farey series, n(j)*d(i)-n(i)*d(j)=1.</p><p>&gt;Get this, the distance a<br/>&gt;tree is from you exactly corresponds to its musical consonance.</p><p>Well, if you really mean dissonance, and you define dissonance of a ratio<br/>n/d as sqrt(n^2+d^2), then OK, this is a measure somewhat similar to others<br/>like Tenney&apos;s. I&apos;ve looked at the series of ratios generated by choosing an<br/>upper bound on this measure, and unfortunately these series don&apos;t display<br/>some of the nice spacing properties of Farey and &quot;Tenney&quot; series.</p><p>&gt;How well you<br/>&gt;can see through the trees is harmonic entropy.</p><p>Hmm . . . I suppose if the trees had finite width, then you might get<br/>something like harmonic entropy, though far less continuous. However,<br/>understanding what you would see in a three-dimensional forest would<br/>certainly be a great first step toward a triadic harmonic entropy model.</p></div>
