That was a<br/>primary inspiration for getting me started on a JI guitar.  Also, if you<br/>haven&apos;t checked it out already, read John Starrett&apos;s refretting guide on<br/>his web page.  I&apos;m currently using it as my main reference in refretting a<br/>Stratocaster to 22ET.  I&apos;m finally getting to the final stages of this<br/>project.  I&apos;ve had too much Life going on the past few months, but recently<br/>I&apos;ve had a bit more time to work on this.  All that remains now is final<br/>fret filing.  Hopefully in the next couple of weeks...</p><p>hooyah,<br/>kris peck</p></div><h3><a id=865 href="#865">ðŸ”—</a>dante rosati &#x3C;dante@xxx.xxxxxxxxx.xxxx&#x3E;</h3><span>2/17/1999 1:05:39 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>&gt;From: &quot;Kris Peck&quot; &lt;<a href="mailto:kpeck@wavetech.net">kpeck@wavetech.net</a>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;Dante-<br/>&gt;Nice work.

If you have strings tuned to different notes, then you would have a<br/>different set of ratios with each string. In effect you would have alot<br/>more ratios at your disposal. Say  you have a string tuned to what well<br/>call 1/1 and it has a fret for 5/4 (for example) . If you have another<br/>string 3/2 to the first string that same fret will make a 15/8 with the<br/>first string. If you have a string tuned 5/4 to the first, that same fret<br/>gives 25/16 and a string tuned 16/9 to the first string gives a  10/9. If<br/>you have a fret that makes a 7-linit ratio with the 1/1 string, say 7/5,<br/>then the other strings give -21/20, 7/4 and 112/45 (sic). While the 7/4 is<br/>useful, I wonder about how often the other two would come in handy. So I<br/>guess you would have to be careful how you tune the strings, or maybe those<br/>way out intervals sound cool?</p><p>With partial frets, especially ones that are only one string wide, you have<br/>to be careful about pulling the string off the edge of the fret, but its<br/>not really a problem.</p><p>I also thought of cutting a slot all the way and then filling in the unused<br/>portion. The thing is the fret positions sometimes only differ by a mm or<br/>two from string to string and that is too close to cut slots for each. On a<br/>guitar with adjustable saddles for each string it might be possible to get<br/>the fret positions lined up, but something tells me that, even if you got<br/>the fret position for 2/1 or 3/2 lined up, some of the higher ratios would<br/>still be in slightly different spots on different strings. I feel like this<br/>should be mathematically demonstrable, but I&apos;m not sure how.</p><p>dante</p></div><h3><a id=867 href="#867">ðŸ”—</a>Darren Burgess &#x3C;dburgess@xxxxxxxxxxxx.xxxx&#x3E;</h3><span>2/17/1999 5:58:08 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Kris wrote:<br/>I&apos;m interested in how you did a JI fretboard with frets that go all the way<br/>across.
