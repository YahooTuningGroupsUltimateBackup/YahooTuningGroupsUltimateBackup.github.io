(Tix only $12, with $7 Tuning<br/>List discount... :)</p><p>Here is the program note, which Johnston graciously sent me of late:</p><p>&quot;Duo for flute and string bass was composed for Bertram and Nancy<br/>Turetzky in the early 1960&apos;s. I was beginning a lifelong research<br/>into the possibilities, microtonal and otherwise, of just intonation<br/>extended well beyond the simple 7-note major scale which that term<br/>originally indicated. The Turetzkys, needing the piece in a hurry,<br/>cautioned me not to expect them to learn such a piece, but expressed<br/>a very active interest in microtones, and a willingness to tackle a<br/>virtuosic demand. I therefore combined techniques (serial, among<br/>others) from the period of my work before that focus of interest, but<br/>this time with pitch bending notated graphically above the notes. The<br/>result, though less systematic than the bulk of my work, greatly<br/>extends the expressive range of pitch usage in the music. It also<br/>strongly implies, aside from notation, that the extended dissonances<br/>of the microtonal &quot;ornaments&quot; should be played off against consonant<br/>intervals, a concept radically different from serialism of the<br/>early &apos;60&apos;s.&quot; -- B.J.</p></div>
