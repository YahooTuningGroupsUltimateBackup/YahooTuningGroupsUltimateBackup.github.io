The Shannon entropy of this distribution is obviously much<br/>&gt; lower than the entropy of the probability distribution of random types<br/>&gt; of thirds, which is maximal in the diatonic scale. And if you&apos;re<br/>&gt; working with a limited number of voices, you need to transmit as much<br/>&gt; information as possible, yes? So that&apos;d be another possible route to<br/>&gt; explore this question, one which is related to the scales Bach<br/>&gt; generally uses - and one which might be worth considering, as omitting<br/>&gt; octaves and fifths as &quot;less important&quot; is common practice even if<br/>&gt; we&apos;re not talking about counterpoint at all.</p><p>Another good, related question is: which generic interval class gives<br/>me the most information, on average, about where in the diatonic scale<br/>I am? In other words, assume we hear a random dyad, and we want to<br/>know what constellation of pitches forms the background scale, and<br/>where our random dyad fits into that. Which generic class of dyad<br/>maximizes the accuracy of my guess, on average? An equivalent question<br/>is: if we call the lowest note of the dyad scale degree &quot;1&quot;, which<br/>mode is in the background? (Note that this equates things like C<br/>ionian and D dorian, because we&apos;re not talking about &quot;tonics&quot; yet at<br/>all.)</p><p>For any generic interval, this can be expressed using the mutual<br/>information I(mode;majmin). This means, given an initial set of seven<br/>modes with equal probability, how much entropy is reduced, on average,<br/>by knowing that this generic interval is major or minor (or large or<br/>small)?</p><p>What we really want is to ask the same question about the diatonic<br/>scale in general. I&apos;d like to say that the best way to formulate this<br/>is to use the conditional mutual information<br/>I(mode;majmin|genericinterval) - I&apos;d like to assume that this is<br/>right, but haven&apos;t checked it out enough yet to know for sure. What we<br/>want to ask is, &quot;how much entropy is reduced, on average and in<br/>general, about which mode we&apos;re playing if we know the specific<br/>interval size of some generic class of interval, assuming all generic<br/>classes are played with equal probability?&quot; If it&apos;s not the three-way<br/>conditional mutual information then it&apos;s definitely one of the many<br/>variants of it.</p><p>Assuming we find a suitable way to formulate this last question, we<br/>should get the same value no matter what 7-note MOS we use. The real<br/>magic is when we then consider the probability distribution of generic<br/>intervals which maximizes the above result. This is like asking, which<br/>distribution of generic intervals should I play to give the listener<br/>as easy of an experience in figuring out where they are in the scale<br/>as possible? As you might have guessed, I&apos;m looking for something like<br/>the channel capacity: the distribution of generic intervals producing<br/>the supremum of conditional mutual information - but I can&apos;t find an<br/>official definition of channel capacity which involves three variables<br/>like this. Does anyone know what to use?</p><p>It&apos;s difficult to figure out what the results of something like this<br/>would be given the lack of formalization on this last part, but I&apos;d<br/>predict that for most sensible things, as a general rule, the<br/>probability for thirds and sixths should go up, and octaves and fifths<br/>will go down. Of course, you have to formulate it in such a way that<br/>the probability of everything but thirds and sixths doesn&apos;t go down to<br/>zero...</p><p>Think about it! More to come.</p><p>-Mike</p></div>
