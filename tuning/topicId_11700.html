If the results did not give an unusually, or<br/>undesirably tempered stack of 1:2s, then might this also be a good<br/>model for an adaptive retuning model for other common<br/>stack-of-an-interval chords, such as the stack of minor and major<br/>thirds, and the stack of fifths?</p><p>&gt; (2) If you _do_ play the notes of the tetrad only two at a time, and<br/>choose all pairs with equal frequency/probability, you have a good<br/>measure of the<br/>expected harmonic entropy of the resulting music.</p><p>Is there some way to combine this sort of a &quot;harmonic entropy of the<br/>resulting music&quot; model with some melodic analogue to the work that&apos;s<br/>been done dealing with optimizing given scales to best accommodate a<br/>given array of vertical sonorities. In other words some paradigm that<br/>attempts to generalize &apos;melodic diatonicity&apos; (i.e., some attempt to<br/>codify what might be the &quot;best&quot; melodic 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10,<br/>11, etc., note scales). I know<br/>that MOS, propriety, and tetrachordality attempt to deal with melodic<br/>stability in a sense, but I&apos;m thinking of something more like the<br/>harmonic entropy measure for dyads with it&apos;s peaks and valleys, and<br/>what your presently gearing up to do when you write, &quot;for sets of<br/>considerably more than four notes (i.e., scales rather than<br/>chords)&quot;... something on the order of a synergistic melodic entropy I<br/>suppose is what I&apos;m imagining here... anyway, keep up the good work.</p><p>Dan</p></div>
