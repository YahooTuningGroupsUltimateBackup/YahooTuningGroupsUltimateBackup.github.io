It was made &amp;<br/>performed by Craig Huxley (who, ironically, played the boy Tommy Starnes in<br/>one of the original [&amp; worst] Star Trek episodes &quot;And the Children Shall<br/>Lead&quot;).<br/>    The Blaster Beam is both a metallic percussion &amp; long string instrument.<br/>It has sonorities/timbres similar to both a large gong &amp; an monster sized<br/>electric guitar/bass/cello/etc..<br/>    It was used in the movie _Star Trek: The Motion Picture_ in scenes with<br/>V&apos;ger. It is probably the most &quot;alien&quot; music Star Trek has come up with so<br/>far,<br/>IMHO. (It was also used in a few short scenes in - I think - one other ST<br/>movie).</p><p>    zHANg<br/>    non-Trekkie/hardcore sci-fi fan/<br/>    &quot;applied science fiction Xenomusicologist&quot;</p></div>
