You are more<br/>likely to spot 2D symmetries like these while only looking thru one<br/>color filter. The 3D throws you off, you don&apos;t &quot;see them coming&quot;.<br/>There are at least 2-fold, 3-fold and 5-fold symmetries.

Would 171 notes<br/>be<br/>&gt; close enough to infinity?</p><p>Having an infinite number of notes shouldn&apos;t be a problem. For<br/>example, you could transform the triangular lattice so that each note<br/>is simply at an integer point in a 4-d Cartesian lattice, and then<br/>apply the same transformation to the motion and distance<br/>calculations. As long as there&apos;s a finite &quot;distance at which volume<br/>goes to zero&quot;, it should be possible to calculate which notes are<br/>sounding, no matter where you are in the infinite lattice.</p><p>&gt;<br/>&gt; In the case of the dekany the observer is tethered to the centre of<br/>&gt; the hyperspherical shell. How do we keep from flying too far away<br/>from<br/>&gt; the hyper-hyper-toroid?</p><p>That shouldn&apos;t be an issue, since you should be dealing with a 4-d<br/>manifold, perhaps a non-euclidean one, but certainly there is no need<br/>to have an actual 5th dimension in which the motion takes place . . .<br/>for example, our universe may be a finite 3-d non-euclidean manifold,<br/>which may be &quot;thinkable&quot; as the hypersurface of a hypersphere in a<br/>euclidean 4-d, but we don&apos;t go around worrying about whether we&apos;re<br/>going to fly away from our universe into a fourth dimension . . . in<br/>other words the world will appear Euclidean to us at any moment,<br/>while in fact a large-scale exploration of it could reveal<br/>otherwise . . . hope that isn&apos;t a completely stupid reply to your<br/>question.</p></div><h3>PERLICH@ACADIAN-ASSET.COM</h3><span>2/18/2001 9:11:26 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>By the way, Dave, the octave-assignment still seems a little funny --<br/>for example, I have</p><p>5x7    5x6<br/>B#4    A#</p><p>right now (factors are 5 6 7 8 9) . . . also it froze up after<br/>running for a while (here on my friend&apos;s Windows 2000 Professional,<br/>Pentium III 800MHz system).</p></div><h3>PERLICH@ACADIAN-ASSET.COM</h3><span>2/18/2001 11:35:04 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>More &quot;bugs&quot; in the dekany spreadsheet:</p><p>When I choose factors 7,8,9,10,11, the note names have so many flats<br/>that in half the transpositions, every other note name disappears<br/>entirely.

The note that has zero pitch bend relative to 12-tET is<br/>the one that is the product of the first two factors. The naming<br/>scheme is based on 1/4-comma meantone. So a workaround is to reorder<br/>the factors so that the first two have GOFs (greatest odd factors) of<br/>(in order of preference) 1, 3, 9, or 5. So in this case 8,9,7,10,11<br/>will give a good result.</p><p>This note namer was a quick hack anyway and isn&apos;t really necessary for<br/>appreciation of the dekany, and given the above workaround, I won&apos;t be<br/>fixing it.</p><p>But notice that the source code (Excel Formulae and Visual Basic<br/>Macros) are completely open to all. So you are welcome to make your<br/>own changes, provided you make it clear on the spreadsheet that you<br/>have modified it, while continuing to acknowledge the original<br/>authors.</p><p>It&apos;s also unfortunate that I can&apos;t arrange the volume barchart to<br/>always be sorted by increasing pitch from left to right. It is setup<br/>to be that way for 4,6,5,7,9.</p><p>&gt; When I click on &quot;stop&quot; and then manipulate the angles, it seems that<br/>&gt; one increment of the motion is executed with every change I make.<br/>The<br/>&gt; reason I think that&apos;s happening is that if I change one angle and<br/>&gt; then change it back, I don&apos;t get the same shape I started with.

This is due to automatic calculation (which we do<br/>want to be on when in &quot;Stop&quot; mode). Unfortunately your suggested<br/>workaround wont work.<br/>What you _could_ do is choose, from the menubar,<br/>Tools/Options/Calculation/Manual. But this will be set back to<br/>automatic every time you hit the Stop button.</p><p>However, the intended way for you to do what you are trying to do is<br/>to uncheck &quot;Motion&quot; and click &quot;Go&quot;. The angle sliders should then work<br/>as you expect. You can uncheck &quot;Sound&quot; too if you want.</p><p>-- Dave Keenan</p></div><h3>Dave Keenan &#x3C;D.KEENAN@UQ.NET.AU&#x3E;</h3><span>2/19/2001 4:29:28 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In tuning@y..., PERLICH@A... wrote:<br/>&gt; By the way, Dave, the octave-assignment still seems a little funny<br/>--<br/>&gt; for example, I have<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; 5x7    5x6<br/>&gt; B#4    A#</p><p>You mean there&apos;s no octave number on the 5x6?
