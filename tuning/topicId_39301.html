Can you also give their mathematical<br/>&gt; equivalencies?  Is not Middle C at 256 Hz?  By the way, no one has<br/>&gt; told me yet how many zeroes are after the 256?</p><p>Greetings,<br/>      Braid-White gives the lowest ET C a freq. of 32.703 Hz and the highest<br/>C = 4186.009 Hz.  Middle C is listed as 261.626 Hz. These numbers are only<br/>approx.  The tuner that uses less stretch will have different figures for the<br/>extremes.  The piano scales that produce higher inharmonicity will also<br/>&quot;expand&quot; these figures.<br/>    I also believe that it makes no sense to associate the pianos range with<br/>C&apos;s, since the earlier keyboards didn&apos;t necessarily begin and end with<br/>C,(today&apos;s don&apos;t either, they ususally have A as the lowest note). Indeed,<br/>before the 1880&apos;s, pianos usually only went to A7 with the 85 note keyboards.<br/>The Romantic era of music, and perhaps marketing, caused a shift upwards to<br/>finalize the scale at C.<br/>    The top note is C because of several reasons. One is that it approaches<br/>the human limits of hearing and physical arm length.  Another is that it<br/>represents a logical musical end point, (it wouldn&apos;t make sense to add a C#<br/>as a final note, since musically, C# didn&apos;t usually represent an oft-used<br/>tonic and ending on a raised key would have been mechanically awkward).<br/>Another is the point of diminishing returns,  the string length for C8 is<br/>approx. 1 7/8&quot; on ALL pianos, be they concert grands or spinets, and it<br/>becomes physically difficult to create a shorter scale and still leave room<br/>for soundboard under it as well as finding a way for the hammer to contact<br/>it.<br/>   The bottom of the keyboard reached A0 and ended there because we can&apos;t<br/>really hear much under 27 Hz.  The extended Bosendorfer scales are intended<br/>to add tension beyond the last playable note (A0) in order to improve the<br/>response of that string. (the last string on a bridge often suffers tonal<br/>deficincies due to mechanical reasons).</p><p>&gt;How many C&apos;s make up what you call &quot;a circle of fifths&quot;?<br/>    The same number of C&apos;s as there are in an octave,  One for sure, two if<br/>you want to &quot;close&quot; it.</p><p> &gt;And, as a novice, I really would like to know why you call it &quot;a<br/>&gt; circle&quot; of notes, and not a sphere or a linear series or a triangle<br/>&gt; or some other &quot;gon&quot;--say a hexagon or other?</p><p>  The difference between the circle and the &quot;gon&quot; is a matter of degree of<br/>observation,(from sufficient distance, any regular polygon of enough sides<br/>may appear as a circle).  Obviously, no shape made from straight lines can be<br/>a &quot;circle&quot;, but the verb form of &quot;circle&quot; does describe the results of a<br/>string of fifths;  they &quot;circle&quot; back to an octave equivalent of the<br/>beginning point, so the &quot;circle&quot; represents the return to the starting point<br/>in an easily describable manner.<br/>Regards,<br/>Ed Foote RPT</p></div>
