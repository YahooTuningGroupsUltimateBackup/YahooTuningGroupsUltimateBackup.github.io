It&apos;s an excellent set of tones that has inspired many to add<br/>various other tones. As for myself taking  2 harmonic series up to the<br/>ninth (your notes plus a 9/8 above C or 27 in your sequence, I added 2<br/>tones to give me a subharmonic on Bb down to the Ninth which produced<br/>repeating tetrachords. I list them in their distance from F in 2 lines so<br/>you can see the repeat of intervals a 3/2 apart starting on the 7/4.</p><p>7/4        21/16<br/>15/8      45/32<br/>1/1        3/2<br/>21/20    63/40<br/>9/8        27/16<br/>5/4        15/8</p><p>Others have come up with other solutions!</p><p>-- Kraig Grady<br/>North American Embassy of Anaphoria Island<br/><a href="http://www.anaphoria.com">www.anaphoria.com</a></p></div><h3><a id=3087 href="#3087">ðŸ”—</a>rtomes@xxxxx.xxx.xxxxxxxxxxxxx)</h3><span>5/16/1999 8:01:39 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>&gt;Ray Tomes wrote:<br/>&gt;&gt; In looking at my harmonics calculations diagrams I found that there is a<br/>&gt;&gt; very nice scale starting at 34560 which is very much like the blues ones<br/>&gt;&gt; mentioned and I am wondering if someone with good equipment would try it<br/>&gt;&gt; out with the indicated frequency ratios (I can&apos;t do this on my computer<br/>&gt;&gt; or keyboard).

In<br/>essence I calculate how many ways each number can be factorised because<br/>that is how many ways each frequency can have relationships with 1.<br/>The results of the simple calculation happen to produce musical scales<br/>and explain the stucture of the universe.  The numbers may be seen at<br/><a href="http://www.kcbbs.gen.nz/users/rtomes/rt-ha-nm.gif">http://www.kcbbs.gen.nz/users/rtomes/rt-ha-nm.gif</a> where 34560 is the<br/>biggest peak (i.e is the strongest harmonic).
