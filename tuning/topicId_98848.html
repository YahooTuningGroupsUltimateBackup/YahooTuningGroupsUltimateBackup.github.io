Trevor (The TwoRegs) and Norm Harris worked on this 19 note per octave song with me.</p><p>Trevor created the lyrics, vocal melody, and sang<br/>Norm composed and played all of the percussion and the harmonica.<br/>Chris composed and played the 19 equal guitar and fretless bass.</p><p>The 19 note per octave guitar has a purer sound to my ears and everyone blended just fine Â– of note is how the 12 equal harmonica fitted in so well.</p></div>
