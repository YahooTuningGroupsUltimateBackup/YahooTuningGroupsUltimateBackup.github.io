I thought that maybe<br/>somebody using Sibelius might be interested in it:</p><p>____________________________________________________________<br/>Adventures with the Pete Walton Sibelius microtonal plug-in</p><p>I wanted to make a short post concerning my recent activities with<br/>Pete Walton&apos;s excellent microtonal plug-in for Sibelius.</p><p>If you recall, Pete has created a plug-in that will automatically<br/>adjust pitch-bends for a microtonal temperament which is user-<br/>specified.</p><p>Basically one specifies, in the plug-in,  the cents deviations from a<br/>given set of Sibelius accidentals.  Let&apos;s take an example:  Cbb,<br/>C3/4flat, Cb, C1/4flat, C, C1/4sharp, C#, C3/4sharp, Cx.</p><p>So, at maximum, using NON-equivalence of enharmonics, it&apos;s<br/>possible to use these 9 native Sibelius symbols times the 7 &quot;white<br/>note&quot; names for a total of 63 pitches.  Indeed, Pete has created<br/>a 63-tET temperament to test the upper extreme of this system.</p><p>Since the upper limit is 63, it&apos;s not possible to make a<br/>temperament of the full 72-tET temperament, an extremely versatile<br/>system, since our &quot;regular&quot; 12-equal is imbedded in it.  (In<br/>fact it consists of 6 different 12-equal scales transposed against<br/>each other by simple just intonation ratios!!)</p><p>However, I was able to create a 21-note subset of 72-tET, which has<br/>been called the &quot;Blackjack&quot; scale on the Internet Tuning<br/>List, after the 21 pitches.</p><p>It&apos;s pretty easy to alter Pete&apos;s plug-in to adapt it to any<br/>given temperament, simply by entering in the alterations in cents<br/>values for each Sibelius accidental from the pitch Sibelius would<br/>normally play.</p><p>There are a couple of things one must be careful about.  One, which<br/>initially confused me quite a bit when working with this, was the<br/>fact that when using the Sibelius quarter-tone FLAT accidental,<br/>Sibelius is altering the pitch a semi-tone below the given note.  For<br/>example, &quot;E-quartertone flat&quot; is actually Eb raised by a<br/>quartertone.  This solves the mysterious situation, probably noticed<br/>by anyone who has run the Sibelius quartertone plug in, that both<br/>quartertone FLATS and quartertone SHARPS have the same pitch bend:<br/>~B0,80  !!  (One would think a quartertone flat should be ~B0,48.  So<br/>if anybody is encountering strange goings on when trying to alter<br/>quartertone playback by pitch bends, this is what is causing it.  (It<br/>stumped me for some timeÂ…)</p><p>Pete&apos;s terrific plug-in creates the pitch bends for us, so we get<br/>appropriate pitch bends for our temperaments.  In the case of 72-tET<br/>we get the following numbers, in case anybody is interested in<br/>manually entering in this wonderful, practical and versatile<br/>temperament.  (Anybody think I like this temperament?? :))</p><p>A &quot;convention&quot; has been established on the Internet Tuning<br/>List to use the following ascii accidentals which emulate the Sims<br/>written ones:</p><p>^ = twelfth-tone high (an arrow)<br/>v = twelfth-tone low</p><p>&gt; = sixth-tone high<br/>&lt; = sixth Â–tone low</p><p>] = quarter-tone high<br/>[ = quarter-tone low</p><p>Using the Pete Walton plug-in, we find the following values for these<br/>accidentals.  This is using the &quot;refined&quot; scale for pitch<br/>bend.  I was never quite sure how this operated until Pete explained<br/>it to me:  basically the &quot;coarse&quot; number is the number<br/>furthest to<br/>the RIGHT.  The &quot;fine&quot; number runs from 1-128 and is the first<br/>number, or the number to the left.</p><p>So we can go from ~B0,64 to ~B128,64 and then from ~B0,65 to ~B128,65<br/>and so forth.  ~B0,64 is actually the &quot;regular&quot; or natural<br/>note, and it&apos;s possible to bend a whole step down from this pitch<br/>and a whole step up from this pitch.  That means ~B0,128 is a whole<br/>step up, ~B0,96 is a semitone bend up, ~B0,64 is &quot;normal,&quot;<br/>~B0,32 is a semitone down and ~B0,0 is a whole tone down. Since there<br/>are a total of 16384 bend units (128 x 128) in the two whole note<br/>span (400 cents), the resolution of the pitch bends is: 400/16384<br/>= .0244 cents. Not bad.</p><p>It&apos;s hardly &quot;rocket science&quot; to realize that a<br/>quartertone is a bend<br/>of 16 up or ~B0, 80, and a quartertone bend down:  ~B0,48.  As I<br/>mention above, however, there is the anomaly that, in the use of the<br/>quartertone FLAT, Sibelius starts on the semitone BELOW and bends<br/>up.  This results, as mentioned, in both the quartertone up and<br/>quartertone down having the same pitch bend, ~B0,80.  Try the simple<br/>quartertone playback plug-in which comes with every copy of Sibelius<br/>and you&apos;ll see what I mean, if you don&apos;t know that already.</p><p>Simple arithmetic will give us the correct coarse pitch bends for the<br/>12-th tones up and down and 6th tones up and down of the Sims 72-tET<br/>system, but the correct numbers of both coarse and fine as realized<br/>by the Pete Walton plug-in are as follows:</p><p>^ = twelfth-tone high (an arrow) ~B56,69<br/>v = twelfth-tone low ~B72,58</p><p>&gt; = sixth-tone high ~B71,74<br/>&lt; = sixth Â–tone low ~B57,53</p><p>] = quarter-tone high ~B0,80<br/>[ = quarter-tone low ~B0,48 [or ~B0,80 with the quartertone flat as<br/>mentioned]</p><p>Now if one is to actually use the Sims-Maneri, symbols, one needs to<br/>use the Postscript font created by New York cellist Ted Mook for this<br/>purpose.  Mook plays many just intonation pieces in 72-tET, including<br/>Harry Partch.  Some people find that heretical, but it does come very<br/>close to just intonation and in a practical manner.</p><p><a href="http://www.mindspring.com/~tmook/micro.html">http://www.mindspring.com/~tmook/micro.html</a></p><p>Given the fact that each pitch of a scale such as &quot;Blackjack&quot;<br/>which uses many of the Sims accidentals has a special accidental on<br/>just about every note of the scale except two, one has to decide if<br/>the Pete Walton plug-in facilitates that particular scale as opposed<br/>to manually entering in the pitch bends according to the bend numbers<br/>given above.  Since it&apos;s so very easy to copy Technique text in<br/>Sibelius from one note to the next, and since the 72-tET system uses<br/>a very few symbols, it&apos;s extremely easy to &quot;alt-click&quot;and<br/>just copy the bends to the notes.</p><p>So, possibly that kind of scale, which uses so many symbols, could be<br/>just as easily done manually.  There is also the situation that the<br/>quartertones provided by Sibelius are not the ones used by Sims!  He<br/>has his own, that look a little like square-root signs.  Personally I<br/>find the Tartini ones that Sibelius uses more elegant, but it is a<br/>fact that many performers who are working in 72-tET now (and indeed<br/>there are several now, one trombonist, in fact, is still coming over<br/>this night for a rehearsal!) are very much used to the Sims symbols,<br/>and would prefer that they be used.</p><p>This means that the quartertone symbols generated by Sibelius<br/>actually have to be REMOVED after the plug-in is run, since there is<br/>no way to HIDE accidentals without hiding the given NOTE in<br/>Sibelius.  (That could be very convenient, and actually would have<br/>been quite useful for a gentleman who posted recently on notating<br/>scores where accidentals only apply to the notes they immediately<br/>precede, very common in contemporary music, of course.)</p><p>One has to figure out the pitch bend numbers for this based upon the<br/>fact that the Sibelius quartertones are REMOVED after the<br/>temperaments plug-in is run!  That really isn&apos;t very difficult,<br/>but it did present a puzzling quandary for a while.</p><p>The Pete Walton plug-in works even better for temperaments such as 19-<br/>tET, which use just our &quot;regular&quot; accidentals, but without<br/>enharmonic equivalence.  There are no &quot;extra&quot; symbols to<br/>import in<br/>that case.  One could just select all the notes on one staff of the<br/>score, run the plug-in and voila!</p><p>Of course, our standard 12-equal pitches do not work in 19-tET, which<br/>is one of the terrific advantages of 72 over practically every other<br/>system.</p><p>I really wish that somebody would have explained this all to me in<br/>the way that I am explaining this all to me, so I hope some of it has<br/>been useful!  :)</p><p>To get the plug-in, please contact Pete Walton at:</p><p><a href="mailto:pete@pswalton.freeserve.co.uk">pete@pswalton.freeserve.co.uk</a></p><p>Pete was extremely patient in explaining all of this, and will help<br/>anybody interested in using his plug in or in &quot;plugging in&quot;<br/>one&apos;s own temperament into the plug-in, as I did.</p><p>Joseph Pehrson</p></div>
