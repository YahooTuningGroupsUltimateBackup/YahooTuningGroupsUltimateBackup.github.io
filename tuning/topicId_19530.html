What I&apos;m interested in are the singable<br/>tones. At the end of W. A. Mathieu&apos;s excellent Harmonic Experience, a good bridging text for<br/>12-tetters, a glossary of singable tones is given, 36 in all, not counting equal tempered half<br/>steps and quarter tones that split various just intervals. When I first saw this I said something<br/>unrepeatable and went on to try to sing some of them against a drone. I&apos;m still at it and probably<br/>will be for the rest of my present incarnation. I know now that it would take supreme skill to be<br/>able to produce these tones at will against a drone, C or Sa, as you wish.</p><p>Which is precisely my point.

I can , and I&apos;m sure most of you could, tell on hearing in comparison<br/>that a 7:6  is ever so slightly flatter than a 75:64, about 7 cents in fact. But how many of us<br/>could spontaneously pitch these two vocally against a drone? (Please don&apos;t say you all can or I&apos;ll<br/>have a self-esteem problem). Although none of this is particularly valid in a scientific<br/>experimental set-up sense I often wonder if a truer measure of the perception of pitch might be<br/>the ability to produce. It&apos;s like native or foreign language competence. You have a passive<br/>vocabulary (syntax, etc.) , or that which you recognise which far exceeds your active vocabulary<br/>or that which you can utter. If anyone has done any research into the musical equivalent of this<br/>I&apos;d be grateful for a lead or two.</p><p>And it&apos;s such a shame to see Paul leave, albeit temporarily.

In a musical context though the<br/>dynamics of a melodic line can make such things happen without it being<br/>a conscious choice. Boomsliter and Creel showed how commatic shifts are<br/>common in even simple melodies. Unfortunately, their research was cut<br/>short before they really carried their idea further. As far as singing<br/>unison, if one has a good tuner that tells you where you are compared to<br/>the pitch, one gets used to hearing what &quot;locking in&quot; sounds like and it<br/>becomes unmistakable. Such distinctions of commas are common in ragas.</p><p>    It just so happens that I am in the process of putting up the<br/>bagpipe tunings of Theodore Podnos.

I wonder how this tuning would cross over to other instruments.<br/>It just struck me that there are a couple of institutions here that<br/>might be interested in your piping research. Both are based in Glasgow<br/>(Scotland as opposed to Iowa or Utah or whatever). The first is the<br/>Piping Centre at <a href="http://www.thepipingcentre.co.uk">www.thepipingcentre.co.uk</a>.<br/>They might even have done some research of their own. I imagine them to<br/>be quite conservative but fiendishly dedicated to their craft. The other<br/>is the Scottish Music Information Centre (SMIC) at <a href="http://www.smic.org.uk">www.smic.org.uk</a> .<br/>They  are a clearing house and information centre for all genres of<br/>Scottish music and might hold databases of research and possible links.</p><p>To my  shame I am quite ignorant of Highland pipe tuning though I have a<br/>big repertoire of pieces arranged for guitar. I know that the thirds are<br/>unusual and I often find the octaves to be  compressed in some way but<br/>maybe that&apos;s just the playing of the journeymen on the streets of<br/>Edinburgh.</p><p>The Dhomnaill daughter is Maighread Ni Dhomnaill and she had a Christmas<br/>song with Donal Lunny called Third Carol For Christmas Day. No doubt<br/>another fine young musician from the Emerald Isle.</p></div>
