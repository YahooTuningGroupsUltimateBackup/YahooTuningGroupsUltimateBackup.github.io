I think it was originally<br/>Carl Lumma&apos;s idea.</p><p>&gt; &gt; So, where are we on this?  I think Wilson&apos;s mapping is:<br/>&gt; ... 497.891 cent generator<br/>&gt; ... [-1, 8, 14, -23, -20]<br/>&gt; &gt; highest interval width: 37<br/>&gt; &gt; complexity measure: 37  (41 for smallest MOS)<br/>&gt; &gt; highest error: 0.004029  (4.835 cents)<br/>&gt; &gt; unique<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Agreed.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; It doesn&apos;t matter that 53 isn&apos;t consistent, because 94 is.  That<br/>&gt; should<br/>&gt; &gt; be 74 notes for the diamond as well, isn&apos;t that less than Dave said?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Yes. You&apos;ve got it wrong. That&apos;s 74 generators, which means 75 notes,<br/>&gt; which is the same as for the 11-limit diamond. This may be ok for the<br/>&gt; 13-limit diamond, but it is a pretty poor mapping for Partch&apos;s 43<br/>&gt; because it has so many holes.</p><p>Then the 13-limit equivalent of Partch&apos;s scale would need around 75<br/>notes.  After a while, diminishing returns start to apply.  The best<br/>15-limit mapping for a diamond comes out as this:</p><p>19/69, 165.033 cent generator</p><p>basis:<br/>(0.5, 0.13752748238381826)</p><p>mapping by period and generator:<br/>([2, 0], ([4, 3, 7, 5, 3], [-3, 6, -5, 7, 16]))</p><p>mapping by steps:<br/>[(80, 58), (127, 92), (186, 135), (225, 163), (277, 201), (296, 215)]</p><p>unison vectors:<br/>[[11, -4, -2, 0, 0, 0], [5, -1, 3, 0, -3, 0], [2, 2, -7, 0, 0, 3], [1,<br/>10, 0, -6, 0, 0]]</p><p>highest interval width: 22<br/>complexity measure: 44  (58 for smallest MOS)<br/>highest error: 0.005692  (6.830 cents)<br/>unique</p><p>So the Partch-like 15-limit scale would have around 90 notes.</p><p>&gt; &gt; If<br/>&gt; &gt; it&apos;s correct, it does beat the multiple-29 mapping for<br/>&gt; &gt; notes-to-the-diamond.  But even by that criterion, this looks<br/>&gt; slightly<br/>&gt; &gt; better again:<br/>&gt; ... 103.897 cent generator<br/>&gt; ... 0.5 octave period<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; mapping by ... generator:<br/>&gt; &gt;...

Can you explain one<br/>&gt; example in detail?, say... this one:</p><p>Okay, and I&apos;ll explain all of it for the benefit for those who haven&apos;t<br/>got as far as you.  I&apos;ll use ratios for tempered intervals to save<br/>writing &quot;approximation of&quot; all the time.</p><p>&gt; &gt; 13/41, 380.391 cent generator</p><p>13/41 is the ratio of the generator to period as pitches.  So it&apos;s 13<br/>steps from a 41 note scale.  And the optimum generator is as shown.  In<br/>some cases the period won&apos;t be an octave, but here it is, so it&apos;s 41<br/>notes to the octave.</p><p>&gt; &gt; basis:<br/>&gt; &gt; (1.0, 0.31699250014423125)</p><p>1.0 is the size of the period in octaves.  Sometimes this will be a<br/>fraction.  0.5 is common.  The other number is the generator again, but<br/>in octaves instead of cents.</p><p>&gt; &gt; mapping by period and generator:<br/>&gt; &gt; ([1, 0], ([0, 2, -1], [5, 1, 12]))</p><p>The first two-element list shows the mapping of the octave.  The second<br/>element is always zero for both my scripts, as the period is always a<br/>fraction of an octave.  So the first number tells you how many equal<br/>parts the octave is being divided into.  Here it&apos;s 1 which is the<br/>simplest case.</p><p>[5, 1, 12], the second of the pair of lists, is the more useful one.  It<br/>specifies each prime interval in terms of the generator.  So 3:1 is 5<br/>generators, 5:1 is 1 generator and 7:1 is 12 generators.</p><p>The [0, 2, -1] says how many periods you need to correct by.  So 3:1 is<br/>exactly 5 generators.  5:1 is 1 generator plus 2 octaves.  7:1 is 12<br/>generators minus an octave.</p><p>In more familiar terms, the generator is a 5:4 major third.  5 major<br/>thirds are a 3:1 perfect twelfth.  An octave less two major thirds is a<br/>9:7 supermajor third.  (2*(5,0) - (12,-1) = (-2, 1))</p><p>I know third-generated MOS scales have been looked at before, so does<br/>anybody have results they&apos;d like to share with us?</p><p>&gt; &gt; mapping by steps:<br/>&gt; &gt; [(22, 19), (35, 30), (51, 44), (62, 53)]</p><p>Each pair shows the size of a prime interval in terms of scale steps.<br/>Call the steps x and y.  An octave is 22x+19y.  For the case where x=y,<br/>you have 41-equal.  Where x=0, you have 19-equal.  Where y=0, you have<br/>22-equal.  So 19, 22 and 41-equal are all members of this temperament<br/>family.</p><p>3:1 is 35x+30y, 5:1 is 51x+44y and 7:1 is 62x+53y.  You can get any<br/>7-prime limit interval in terms of x and y by combining these.</p><p>For visualising the scale, it can be simpler to reduce each prime<br/>interval to be within the octave.</p><p>&gt; &gt; [(22, 19), (35, 30), (51, 44), (62, 53)]</p><p>3:2 is  13x + 11y<br/>5:4 is   7x + 6y<br/>8:7 is   4x + 4y</p><p>and use simpler coordinates.  Here, q=x+y and p=x</p><p>3:2 is  11q + 2p<br/>5:4 is   6q +  p<br/>8:7 is   4q</p><p>So q is 2 steps in 41-equal, or 1 step in 22- or 19-equal and p is 1 step<br/>in 41-or 22-equal, and no steps in 19-equal.</p><p>&gt; &gt; unison vectors:<br/>&gt; &gt; [[-10, -1, 5, 0], [5, -12, 0, 5]]</p><p>These probably aren&apos;t in their simplest terms. That bit of the program<br/>still needs working on.  Dan Stearns says he can do it ...</p><p>They&apos;re the ratio-space vectors for intervals that are tempered out to<br/>become unisons.</p><p>              Graham</p></div>
