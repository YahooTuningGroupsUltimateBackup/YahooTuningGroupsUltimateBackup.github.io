This follows more of Partch&apos;s<br/>listing of Handel with 16 tones in Genesis (p. 430), than with the Bosanquet<br/>description of split-key shadows still remaining in the mid 19th century.</p><p>There were many things that I disagreed with regarding the all-microtonal<br/>issue.  I remember working hard to stop the publishing of a plagiarized<br/>entry.  I only provided the numbers for the graphic after it was already in<br/>finished form.</p><p>Where did you find organ stops instead of split keys?</p><p>Johnny Reinhard<br/>AFMM</p></div>
