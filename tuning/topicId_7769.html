That&apos;s pretty much exactly how<br/>Paul Hahn&apos;s site has _defined_ consistency for over a year now.  I just<br/>never understood it properly before.  Or maybe I did, and then forgot.<br/>Anyway, that&apos;s not the new part.</p><p>The new part is the program found at...</p><p>ftp://lumma.org/pub/consist_triad.ss (SWL run for Chez Scheme)<br/>ftp://lumma.org/pub/triad_run.txt (Chez Scheme code)</p><p>Like the other two programs at my ftp site, this one checks a range of ET&apos;s<br/>for consistency.  You call it by typing...</p><p>(chart min-ET max-ET)</p><p>...where min-ET and max-ET are whole numbers representing the ET&apos;s at the<br/>ends of your range.  So if you want to check all ET&apos;s between 5 and 41,<br/>inclusive, you&apos;d type (chart 5 41).  If you want to check just 41tET, type<br/>(chart 41 41).</p><p>The difference between this program and the others is the way it checks for<br/>consistency.  Instead of using the nifty shortcut outlined in Paul<br/>pseudocode, it actually checks all the triads at each limit.  Importantly,<br/>it returns the triads that fail.  So, even if the ET is not consistent at<br/>the limit, you can see where.  And you can construct chords with which the<br/>ET is consistent by simiply making sure they don&apos;t contain any of the<br/>failing triads.</p><p>Below, I&apos;ve run the program on some of my favorite ET&apos;s.  The limit is<br/>backed off, starting at 19, until full consistency is achieved.  To find<br/>the triads that fail at a given limit, look at everything listed from the<br/>bottom up to and including the limit in question.  So if I want to find<br/>13-limit chords consistent with 5tET, I just make sure they don&apos;t contain<br/>any (13 7), (13 11), or (11 5) triads.  Wait a minute!  Those are pairs,<br/>not triads!  The &quot;1&quot; is implied.  So the best 11/1 in 5tET is not the sum<br/>of the best 5/1 and 11/5.</p><p>If you see a blank next to a limit, it means you can add that identity to<br/>any set without changing the consistency value of the set.  For example,<br/>12tET has a blank next to 19.  This means that you can add the 19-identity<br/>to any set with which 12tET is consistent, and the new set will be<br/>consistent too!</p><p>If anybody spots an error in my reasoning here, please let me know.  Any<br/>questions are welcome.  Enjoy!</p><p>(5<br/>  19 (19 5) (19 13) (19 15)<br/>  17 (17 3) (17 5) (17 9) (17 13) (17 15)<br/>  15 (15 7) (15 11)<br/>  13 (13 7) (13 11)<br/>  11 (11 5)</p><p>(7<br/>  19 (19 5) (19 15)<br/>  17 (17 5) (17 9) (17 11) (17 15)<br/>  15 (15 7)<br/>  13<br/>  11 (11 7)<br/>   9 (9 7)<br/>   7 (7 5)</p><p>(10<br/>  19 (19 3) (19 9) (19 11) (19 17)<br/>  17<br/>  15<br/>  13<br/>  11 (11 5)<br/>   9 (9 5)</p><p>(12<br/>  19<br/>  17 (17 11)<br/>  15 (15 13)<br/>  13 (13 5) (13 7) (13 11)<br/>  11 (11 3) (11 9)</p><p>(15<br/>  19 (19 17)<br/>  17 (17 3) (17 9) (17 13) (17 15)<br/>  15 (15 7)<br/>  13 (13 7)<br/>  11<br/>   9 (9 7)</p><p>(17<br/>  19<br/>  17 (17 3) (17 7) (17 9) (17 11) (17 13)<br/>  15 (15 7) (15 9) (15 11) (15 13)<br/>  13 (13 5)<br/>  11 (11 5)<br/>   9 (9 5)<br/>   7 (7 5)<br/>   5 (5 3)</p><p>(19<br/>  19 (19 7) (19 9) (19 13) (19 15)<br/>  17 (17 7) (17 9) (17 13) (17 15)<br/>  15 (15 11)<br/>  13 (13 11)<br/>  11 (11 7)</p><p>(22<br/>  19 (19 3) (19 7) (19 9) (19 15) (19 17)<br/>  17<br/>  15<br/>  13 (13 3) (13 7) (13 9)</p><p>(25<br/>  19 (19 3) (19 13) (19 15)<br/>  17 (17 3) (17 13) (17 15)<br/>  15 (15 7) (15 9) (15 11)<br/>  13 (13 5) (13 7) (13 9) (13 11)<br/>  11 (11 3)<br/>   9 (9 3)<br/>   7 (7 3)</p><p>(26<br/>  19 (19 11) (19 15)<br/>  17 (17 15)<br/>  15 (15 3) (15 5) (15 9) (15 13)</p><p>(27<br/>  19 (19 11) (19 15) (19 17)<br/>  17 (17 3) (17 5) (17 7) (17 9)<br/>  15 (15 3) (15 5) (15 7) (15 9) (15 13)<br/>  13<br/>  11 (11 3) (11 5) (11 7) (11 9)</p><p>(29<br/>  19 (19 17)<br/>  17 (17 5) (17 7) (17 11) (17 13) (17 15)</p><p>(31<br/>  19 (19 9) (19 11)<br/>  17 (17 9) (17 11)<br/>  15<br/>  13 (13 9) (13 11)</p><p>(34<br/>  19 (19 3) (19 9) (19 11) (19 13) (19 15)<br/>  17<br/>  15 (15 7)<br/>  13 (13 7)<br/>  11 (11 7)<br/>   9 (9 7)<br/>   7 (7 3) (7 5)</p><p>(35<br/>  19 (19 3) (19 5) (19 7)<br/>  17 (17 13)<br/>  15 (15 3) (15 5) (15 7)<br/>  13 (13 3) (13 5) (13 7) (13 11)<br/>  11<br/>   9 (9 3)</p><p>(37<br/>  19 (19 3) (19 15)<br/>  17 (17 3) (17 15)<br/>  15 (15 9)<br/>  13<br/>  11<br/>   9 (9 3)</p><p>(41<br/>  19 (19 17)<br/>  17 (17 5) (17 7) (17 15)</p><p>(53<br/>  19 (19 17)<br/>  17 (17 11)<br/>  15<br/>  13<br/>  11 (11 7)</p><p>(58<br/>  19 (19 5) (19 7) (19 9) (19 11) (19 13) (19 15)</p><p>(72<br/>  19 (19 13)</p><p>-Carl</p></div><h3><a id=7770 href="#7770">ðŸ”—</a>Paul H.
