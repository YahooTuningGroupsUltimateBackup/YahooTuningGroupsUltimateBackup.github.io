It&apos;s for a 17-piece work inspired by the Statue of Liberty to be<br/>performed on June 1 in New York&apos;s Battery Park.</p><p>The strange thing for me was that my playing the written notes accurately was<br/>considered wrong by Ornette.  Since he sees Classical musicians as tied to<br/>the notes, basically missing the true sounds, they are akin &quot;to people that<br/>do the windows.&quot;  Still, the music was too fast to do much in the wind<br/>sectional.</p><p>He basically seems to have evolved a theory of music based on transposing<br/>instruments.  He thinks in terms of changing clefs, treating the accidentals<br/>as a &quot;musica ficta.&quot;  This should be fun.</p><p>Johnny Reinhard</p></div><h3>Afmmjr@aol.com</h3><span>5/19/2000 5:54:55 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Ornette Coleman has a Harmolodic theory for his music.  Since transpositions<br/>are discarded, there is a &quot;new&quot; clef, a harmolodic clef.  Unfortunately, I<br/>can&apos;t represent it in e-mail.  (It was drawn for me by Ornette&apos;s copyist on a<br/>napkin!)  But it&apos;s cute.</p><p>So, there is only a staff, with all 4 notes reading (for treble, bass, alto,<br/>and tenor clef readings).  Only accidentals change as a result, so there is<br/>an improviser&apos;s freedom to  play sharps and flats as fit to the player&apos;s<br/>imagination and sense (&quot;musica ficta&quot;).</p><p>So, there is an &quot;intra-scale&quot; or &quot;uni-scale&quot; that Eb and Bb saxophones and<br/>clarinets can share with trombones and violas.  Essentially, Ornette composes<br/>a tune and places it on a matrix stemming from the diminished 7th chord C Eb<br/>F# A, and this leads to notes that harmonize out.  Then they are played in<br/>two parts for checking, and at last it meshes into a large ensemble.  It is<br/>parts first, score later.</p><p>The &quot;microtonal&quot; aspect, a term regularly associated with Ornette Coleman&apos;s<br/>music, is still just beyond my reach.  However, this understanding is clearly<br/>measured in days.  June 1 is the big event in New York&apos;s Battery Park.  The<br/>outdoor concert ushers in the Jazz season in the City.</p><p>Johnny Reinhard<br/>AFMM<br/>bassoonist</p></div><h3>Afmmjr@aol.com</h3><span>6/6/2000 10:16:41 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Well, the Ornette Coleman concert has come and gone.  It was the opening<br/>event of the Bell Atlantic Jazz Festival that Dan was mentioning.  It was a<br/>good night and it was quite favorably received.</p><p>However, there is no &quot;theory&quot; of microtones present in Ornette&apos;s music.<br/>Critics must feel chic to use the term.  It can only apply to squawks ans<br/>shimmies, or to &quot;raw sound.&quot;  Ornette is big on getting your sound, favoring<br/>a single note over all others.</p><p>Essentially, he takes all the scaless and turns them into an &quot;intra-scale&quot;<br/>with very specific modulational possibilities.  Of course, I through in a<br/>Harmolodic quartertone line here and there and it was appreciated.<br/>Harmolodic is the name of Ornette&apos;s studio and applies to the idea that all<br/>transposed instruments can play the same written notes and be freshly<br/>harmonic.  Only the accidentals do not translate exactly.  They can be placed<br/>to taste.</p><p>Johnny Reinhard<br/>AFMM</p></div>
