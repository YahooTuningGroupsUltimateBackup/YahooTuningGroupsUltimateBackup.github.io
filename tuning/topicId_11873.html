Recently I seem to be<br/>using it more than any other tuning -- with interludes of medieval<br/>Pythagorean or Renaissance 1/4-comma meantone -- so maybe this<br/>discussion of 29-tet comes when &quot;the iron is hot.&quot;</p><p>Here I would like to look first at the usual (and very beautiful)<br/>aspects of 29-tet as a regular neo-Gothic temperament, and then some<br/>more esoteric and quasi-historical aspects which may draw interesting<br/>replies, especially from the Monz.</p><p>At the beginning, I should emphasize that how one views a tuning such<br/>as 29-tet may depend on one&apos;s musical viewpoint. Someone like Paul<br/>Erlich using 29-tet as a kind of 5-limit or higher meantone tuning<br/>would likely have some quite different observations to offer than what<br/>follows. Even such a basic statement as &quot;29-tet has nice major thirds&quot;<br/>could refer to two or possibly three different sizes of intervals<br/>depending on one&apos;s stylistic viewpoint.</p><p>The following discussion approaches 29-tet as a hypermeantone -- that<br/>is, a regular temperament with fifths wider than Pythagorean or pure.<br/>The spectrum of hypermeantones ranges from Pythagorean to 5-tet, with<br/>the portion of this spectrum most relevant for Gothic or neo-Gothic<br/>music going out at least as far as 22-tet -- or 27-tet in certain<br/>timbres.</p><p>------------------------------------------<br/>1. Some musical observations: usual styles<br/>------------------------------------------</p><p>From my musical perspective, 29-tet is a subtly accentuated version of<br/>a standard medieval Pythagorean tuning. The fifths are tempered by<br/>around 1.49 cents in the wide direction (and fourths in the narrow<br/>direction), leaving these intervals quite close to pure.</p><p>If asked for an overall impression of the tuning, I might say, &quot;rather<br/>mild, gentle, and charming.&quot; As a close neighbor of Pythagorean,<br/>29-tet offers some intriguing shades of difference; at the same time,<br/>it&apos;s on the mild side of 17-tet, which is a bit more of a clearly<br/>_neo_-Gothic tuning.</p><p>Major thirds in 29-tet at ~413.38 cents are not too far from<br/>Pythagorean, and about midway between a Pythagorean 81:64 (~407.82<br/>cents) or a 19:15 (~409.24 cents) and a 14:11 (~417.51 cents). I like<br/>them very much in certain voicelike timbres on a Yamaha TX-802<br/>synthesizer, and also for example in a mixture of two harpischord-like<br/>timbres.</p><p>A slight timbral nuance: while I tend in Pythagorean to play the lower<br/>voices with the richer harpsichord-like timbre, in 29-tet I tend to<br/>use this timbre for the upper parts, and a more &quot;harp-like&quot; or<br/>&quot;lute-like&quot; registration for the lower parts. Possibly this preference<br/>reflects the somewhat greater acoustical tension involving the fifth<br/>partial of the richer timbre in 29-tet. The goal in either case is a<br/>&quot;semi-concordant&quot; major third, at once pleasant and intriguing in<br/>itself, and moving toward some expected resolution.</p><p>Interestingly, the 29-tet minor third at ~289.66 cents is an excellent<br/>approximation of 13:11 (~289.21 cents), and this interval very nicely<br/>contracts to a unison -- or expands to a fifth also in 13th-century<br/>styles.</p><p>Major seconds at ~206.90 cents and minor sevenths at ~993.10 cents are<br/>around 2.99 cents from their pure Pythagorean counterparts at 9:8 and<br/>16:9. These intervals and the near-pure fifths and fourths produce<br/>very nice Gothic or neo-Gothic sonorities such as 4:6:9, 9:12:16,<br/>6:8:9, and 8:9:12.</p><p>A pleasant feature of this tuning, both in its mathematical simplicity<br/>and in its aural effect, is the division of the whole-tone into five<br/>equal parts. The usual diatonic semitone or limma is 2/5-tone or<br/>~82.76 cents, a very nice size for usual cadences, and narrower than<br/>the already compact Pythagorean interval of 256:243 (~90.22 cents) or<br/>about 4/9-tone. The chromatic semitone or apotome is 3/5-tone or<br/>~124.14 cents, an interval lending its flavor to a neat cadential<br/>variation.</p><p>This variation brings us to the topic of alternative thirds (augmented<br/>seconds and diminished fourths) in 29-tet, another neat nuance of this<br/>tuning. While Pythagorean versions of these intervals (&quot;schisma<br/>thirds&quot;) very closely approach 5-limit ratios, 29-tet gives them their<br/>own distinct character. Our alternative major third or diminished<br/>fourth is ~372.41 cents, and our alternative minor third or augmented<br/>second is ~331.03 cents.</p><p>These intervals differ from 5:4 and 6:5 by amounts roughly comparable<br/>to regular major and minor thirds in 12-tet -- but in the opposite<br/>directions, of course, maybe approaching the &quot;zones of influence&quot; of<br/>intervals such as 21:17 (~365.83 cents) or 17:14 (~336.13 cents).  A<br/>tuning like my &quot;e-based hypermeantone&quot; (with the ratio between the<br/>whole-tone and diatonic semitone equal to Euler&apos;s e, ~2.71828) takes<br/>us more clearly into such zones of influence, but the intermediate<br/>realm of 29-tet can have its own special attractions.</p><p>Thus in 29-tet both the regular and alternative thirds have an active<br/>quality, and the latter intervals invite resolutions like the<br/>following involving the wide chromatic semitone or apotome, with C4 as<br/>middle C and higher note numbers showing higher octaves. Vertical<br/>intervals in cents are shown in parentheses, while signed numbers show<br/>melodic intervals in the ascending (positive) or descending (negative)<br/>directions:</p><p>  Bb3 -- ~+124.14 -- C4<br/>(~331.03)         (~703.45)<br/>  G3  -- ~-206.90 -- F3<br/>(~372.41)           (0.00)<br/>  Eb3 -- ~+124.14 -- F3</p><p>       (m3-1 + M3-5)</p><p>The difference between the diatonic and chromatic semitones is<br/>1/5-tone, or one scale step -- about 41.38 cents. Interestingly this<br/>is very close to the 128:125 diesis of 1/4-comma meantone (~41.06<br/>cents), and maybe invites some experiments in neo-Gothic chromaticism<br/>with melodic figures alternating between these contrasting semitones.</p><p>---------------------------------------------------------------<br/>2. Quasi-historical aspects: 29-tet and &quot;ultra-Gothic&quot; cadences<br/>---------------------------------------------------------------</p><p>As a tuning system which rather closely approximates Pythagorean while<br/>dividing the whole-tone into five equal parts, 29-tet has another and<br/>more &quot;radical&quot; side. It permits variants on the usual cadences<br/>featuring the use of a melodic &quot;diesis&quot; of only 1/5-tone or ~41.38<br/>cents, and &quot;superwide&quot; major thirds near 13:10 and major sixths near<br/>26:15.</p><p>Before getting into the possible &quot;quasi-historical&quot; implications of<br/>these progressions, let&apos;s look at a characteristic example, using the<br/>ASCII asterisk (*) to show a note raised by a diesis or 1/5-tone:</p><p>  E*4 --  ~+41.38 -- F4<br/>(~951.72)         (1200.00)<br/>  B*3 --  ~+41.38 -- C4<br/>(~455.17)         (~703.45)<br/>  G3  -- ~-206.90 -- F3</p><p>       (Mx3-5 + Mx6-8)</p><p>Here the cadential major third expanding to a fifth is a diesis wider<br/>than usual, or ~455.17 cents, very close to 13:10 (~454.21 cents); and<br/>likewise the major sixth (~951.72 cents) expanding to an octave, very<br/>close to 26:15 (~952.26 cents). To show that these intervals differ<br/>from usual major thirds and sixths, I call them &quot;maximal&quot; thirds and<br/>sixths, or Mx3 and Mx6, thus notating this cadence as (Mx3-5 + Mx6-8).</p><p>As a feature of neo-medieval style, this kind of &quot;ultra-Gothic&quot;<br/>cadence can be very striking, and I like the effect especially with<br/>certain voice-like timbres on synthesizer.</p><p>Now for the quasi-historical part, which the Monz (and maybe others)<br/>may have anticipated. Marchettus of Padua, in his _Lucidarium_ of<br/>1318, advocates that singers follow an intonation based on the usual<br/>2:1 octaves, 3:2 fifths, 4:3 fourths, and 9:8 whole-tones of<br/>Pythagorean tuning -- but deriving other intervals, especially certain<br/>cadential ones, from a division of the whole-tone into &quot;five parts.&quot;</p><p>Each of these parts is known as a &quot;diesis,&quot; and here the<br/>interpretive debate swiftly gets under way. Are these dieses equal or<br/>unequal? Is the &quot;fivefold division&quot; of the tone a geometric one<br/>(calling for the element of a temperament) or possibly an arithmetic<br/>one (as in a monochord division)? Are the &quot;five parts&quot; of the tone a<br/>mathematical formulation, or more of a guide for singers -- who are<br/>not bound to any fixed tuning?</p><p>Of special interest is the cadential diesis of Marchettus, which he<br/>defines as equal to &quot;one of the five parts of a tone.&quot; If this is an<br/>equal or roughly equal division, than a cadence like the above<br/>&quot;ultra-Gothic&quot; example would result.</p><p>While scholars including our own Monz have come up with many ingenious<br/>interpretations of Marchettus, there is one passage which to me<br/>suggests that 29-tet may in fact provide one intriguing realization<br/>of his cadential aesthetics.</p><p>In his discussion of the resolution of unstable intervals or<br/>&quot;dissonances&quot; -- Marchettus refers to thirds and sixths as &quot;tolerable<br/>dissonances,&quot; while 14th-century writers in the French tradition, for<br/>example, tend to call them &quot;imperfect concords&quot; or the like -- he<br/>compares two resolutions of the cadential major sixth, one standard<br/>and the other a &quot;feigned color&quot; (loosely translated, a &quot;deceptive<br/>cadential inflection&quot;):</p><p>D4   C#4  D4              D4   C#4  C4<br/>D3   E3   D3              D3   E3   F3</p><p>8    M6   8               8    M6   5</p><p>In the notation of Marchettus, the C# shows that the note C is raised<br/>by an extra-wide &quot;chromatic semitone&quot; equal to &quot;four parts of a tone,&quot;<br/>leaving only &quot;one part of a tone&quot; for the remaining diesis C#-D. The<br/>problem which Marchettus considers is why the first resolution is<br/>standard, while the second is less expected and favored.</p><p>Having earlier explained that a cadential dissonance should approach<br/>the consonance which it seeks (e.g. M3-5, M6-8) as closely as possible<br/>-- thus calling for the cadential diesis of only &quot;one of the five<br/>parts&quot; of a tone -- he remarks that the major sixth of these two<br/>progressions is equally far from either the octave or the fifth. Thus<br/>the question arises: why does the standard resolution to the octave<br/>seem better to fit the norm of &quot;closest approach&quot;?</p><p>One answer, the first offered by Marchettus, is that the octave at 2:1<br/>is a purer consonance than the fifth at 3:2, and thus a more<br/>satisfying destination for the major sixth, located as it is &quot;six<br/>dieses&quot; from either stable goal. However, both the framing of the<br/>question, and the second answer of Marchettus, are of special<br/>interest.</p><p>In saying that a cadential major sixth is equally &quot;six dieses&quot; from<br/>either the octave or the fifth, Marchettus may be implying that his<br/>dieses are at least roughly equal, so that one can validly compare<br/>distances between intervals using them.</p><p>In 29-tet, an extra-wide or &quot;maximal&quot; major sixth at 23 steps is<br/>indeed precisely 6/5-tone (or 6/29 octave) from either the usual goal<br/>of the octave (29 steps) or the less usual goal by contrary motion of<br/>the fifth (17 steps). This doesn&apos;t mean that Marchettus necessarily<br/>intended vocal intonation precisely in 29-tet, or using this scale as<br/>the basis for an &quot;adaptive JI&quot; scheme to make fifths, fourths, and<br/>major seconds pure -- only that 29-tet seems to realize the idea of a<br/>cadential major sixth (or &quot;maximal sixth&quot;) about equally far from the<br/>octave or the fifth.</p><p>As his second answer to the problem of why the resolution to the<br/>octave is more favored, Marchettus analyzes the melodic motion of each<br/>voice in the cadence. Generally, he presents ideal cadential action as<br/>involving movement by _both_ voices in contrary motion: both voices<br/>share in the &quot;dissonance,&quot; and both participate in its resolution.</p><p>Comparing the two resolutions by contrary motion of the major sixth,<br/>he notes that in the usual resolution to the octave, the lower voice<br/>descends by a regular whole-tone or five dieses, while the upper voice<br/>ascends by one diesis, the narrowest possible interval of the system.</p><p>In contrast, in the unusual resolution to the fifth, the lower voice<br/>ascends by the usual diatonic semitone or limma (to Marchettus, an<br/>&quot;enharmonic semitone&quot;) of two dieses, while the upper voice descends<br/>by its wide &quot;chromatic semitone&quot; of four dieses.</p><p>If we look at these progressions in 29-tet, using the maximal sixth in<br/>either case, these descriptions exactly and intuitively fit. Here<br/>numbers in parentheses show vertical intervals in scale steps, and<br/>signed numbers show melodic motion in scale steps or &quot;dieses&quot;:</p><p>C#*4 -- +1 -- D4              C#*4 -- -4 -- C4<br/>(23)         (29)             (23)         (17)<br/>E3   -- -5 -- D3              E3   -- +2 -- F3</p><p>Mx6           8               Mx6           5</p><p>Marchettus explains that the usual resolution to the octave is more<br/>satisfying in part because one of the voices moves by the narrowest<br/>interval possible, the cadential diesis equal to &quot;one of the five<br/>parts&quot; of a tone -- here C#*-D in the upper voice. In contrast, the<br/>smallest interval involved in the unusual resolution to the fifth is<br/>the usual semitone of &quot;two dieses,&quot; here E3-F3 in the lower voice.</p><p>At the least, this comparison of the cadential M6-8 and M6-5<br/>progressions suggests that Marchettus indeed regards the cadential<br/>diesis as substantially smaller than the usual semitone or limma --<br/>with the 29-tet distinction between these melodic intervals at<br/>2/5-tone and 1/5-tone nicely fitting the terms of his comparison.</p><p>In a slightly different realization, one could tune the cadential<br/>major thirds and sixths (our &quot;maximal&quot; thirds and sixths) at precisely<br/>13:10 and 26:15 in a JI system with a 3-odd-limit of stability but a<br/>13-prime-limit or higher for generating unstable intervals. Many<br/>neo-Gothic temperaments including 29-tet tend to approximate such a<br/>state of affairs.</p><p>Finally, I should note that the 29-tet interval of 23 steps can be<br/>used either as a Marchettus-like(?) &quot;maximal sixth&quot; or as a &quot;minimal<br/>seventh&quot; regularly resolving to the fifth by a progression featuring a<br/>cadential diesis, e.g.:</p><p>D4  -- -5 -- C4<br/>(23)        (17)<br/>E*3 -- +1 -- F3</p><p>Although Marchettus focuses on thirds and sixths as unstable cadential<br/>intervals, the resolution from minor seventh to fifth occurs in<br/>various 13th-14th century styles. Like the progression from maximal<br/>sixth to octave, this intonational variation using 23/29 octave as a<br/>&quot;minimal seventh&quot; contracting to a fifth features motion by a<br/>whole-tone (five dieses) in one voice, and by a single cadential<br/>diesis in the other.</p><p>In short, 29-tet is a temperament rich with many neo-medieval<br/>possibilities, ranging from the rather gently neo-Gothic to the<br/>adventurous ultra-Gothic. This isn&apos;t to exclude all the other uses of<br/>this tuning, only to offer a sketch of one very attractive side of its<br/>musical flavor.</p><p>Most respectfully,</p><p>Margo Schulter<br/><a href="mailto:mschulter@value.net">mschulter@value.net</a></p></div><h3><a id=11890 href="#11890">ðŸ”—</a>Monz &#x3C;MONZ@JUNO.COM&#x3E;</h3><span>8/26/2000 9:37:55 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>&gt; [Margo Schulter]<br/>&gt; <a href="http://www.egroups.com/message/tuning/11873">http://www.egroups.com/message/tuning/11873</a><br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; ...
