Maybe somebody can tell me about properties of just intonation<br/>  &gt; scales, like conditions they have to satisfy?</p><p>  You replied:<br/>  &gt; First of, I don&apos;t see why they have to be ordered.  That is a scale is<br/>  &gt; a set of notes, not a sequence, and therefore not uniquely tied to<br/>  &gt; melody.  Surprisingly enough, there seems to be disagreement on this.<br/>  &gt; ...<br/>  &gt;                               Graham</p><p>  Let me give you an example where the scale has to be a sequence<br/>  of notes, not just a set of notes:  the melodic minor scale of<br/>  common practice.  It&apos;s usually taught that the scale has two<br/>  distinct forms, one ascending and the other descending.  For<br/>  example, the C minor scale runs thus -</p><p>  Ascending: C D Eb F G A B C&apos;<br/>  Descending: C&apos; Bb Ab G F Eb D C</p><p>  - and it&apos;s in _both_ those forms that countless music students<br/>  for centuries have practiced it.</p><p>  But of course, you knew that!  Just thought I&apos;d remind you :-)</p><p>  .....</p><p>  &gt;From the point of view of _tuning_ the scale, what matters are<br/>  the pitches of the notes that comprise it, and their (intervallic)<br/>  relationship.  The order is a secondary consideration.  The set<br/>  of notes in any scale, I prefer to call the gamut.  In the case of<br/>  C minor, we have more than the usual 7 pitches per octave; 9 in<br/>  fact.  It is an abstraction from the scale.  Until historically recent<br/>  advances in technology (logarithms, calculators and computers)<br/>  simplified calculation, scales have usually arisen from _melodic<br/>  practice_, rather than from theoretical harmonic ideas.</p><p>  Which is not to say that building scales based purely on theoretical<br/>  reasons is wrong!; merely that you won&apos;t know what kind of music<br/>  you can make with them until you hear them in practice.  But no<br/>  matter what its genesis, any scale is just another musical resource.<br/>  Human hearing is the essential medium through which those<br/>  resources must pass, and individual taste is the final arbiter of<br/>  which resources are useful.</p><p>  To me, a scale is at least two sequences of notes - one ascending,<br/>  another descending - drawn from a gamut, which is a set of notes.</p><p>  (I say &quot;at least&quot;, since in my experience, some Indian singers use<br/>  more than one alteration (like that of A Ab in C minor) of a single<br/>  scale degree, depending on the particular ornament they&apos;re using<br/>  at the time.  I believe that classically-trained Western violinists<br/>  do something similar; whether deliberately or not, I couldn&apos;t say.)</p><p>  Regards,<br/>  Yahya</p></div>
