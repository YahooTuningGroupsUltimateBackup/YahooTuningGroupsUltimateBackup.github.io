As some of you<br/>have obviously already surmised, the piano won&apos;t sound like a piano if the<br/>octaves are not slightly stretched.</p><p>The conservative stretching yields a 25 cents eighthtone at the top, more<br/>typically at 35 cents and 45 cents.  Everything will be pure inside the<br/>octave, to itself.  This is a fascinating calculation because the whole piece<br/>is based on the theory of an eighthtone dieses in both the Pythagorean comma<br/>and in 48-tET (which is used for 2 measures of 5 trumpets).</p><p>Wish us luck heading to Michael Harrison&apos;s studios in Brooklyn.  This is the<br/>new downtown.</p><p>Peace, Johnny</p></div>
