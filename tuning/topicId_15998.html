It would just consist of lots of lines like<br/>&gt; Reached line such and such<br/>&gt; Reached line such and such, relevant variables such and such,<br/>&gt; etc.<br/>&gt;</p><p>&gt; Well, this is no problem.  Just tell me exactly what to do...</p><p>Thanks, really appreciate it.</p><p>&gt; I&apos;ll try the newest beta first, just to see if it works any better...<br/>&gt; by comparison, now the &quot;older&quot; one is a disappointment!</p><p>Yes, I have fixed a few bugs in it, not ones that caused crashes here,<br/>but you never know.</p><p>&gt; &gt; This isn&apos;t completely guaranteed to work because occasionally in<br/>&gt; this situation,adding in debug code can change it enough to stop it<br/>&gt; from crashing</p><p>&gt; This is funny... well, ok, it&apos;s funny to ME, but it wouldn&apos;t be very<br/>&gt; funny to anyone programming the thing...</p><p>Yes, I can see the humerous side of it. Can indeed be frustrating<br/>when you&apos;ve put a whole lot of debug code in, then have to take it out again<br/>and try another tack. :-)</p><p>Can happen esp. when debugging something that depends on relative<br/>timing of parts of the prog. and the debug code slows it down just<br/>enough to stop the bug happening. Or else, because the bug is result<br/>of attempt to access memory that does belong to the prog. but<br/>not the area it should be using, so what is in the memory causes the crash,<br/>and depends on what was done in the previous lines, which changes<br/>because of the debug code and prevents the crash... }:-(</p><p>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; Making sure FTS doesn&apos;t crash is my top priority, so I hope you can<br/>&gt; help with this, - nobody else has yet reported this bug to me.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; Well, I can&apos;t imagine there&apos;s anything that &quot;special&quot; about my own<br/>&gt; setup...</p><p>Could be something like version numbers of the dlls maybe, - a<br/>windows program is &quot;an extension of the operating system&quot; to<br/>quote Charles Petzold.</p><p>Or who knows, maybe your mouse driver even;<br/>there&apos;s lots of detail involved in the environment a Windows program works in.</p><p>(I&apos;ve got a new mouse which is v. frustrating because it keeps ignoring<br/>mouse moves, and doing double clicks at random instead of single clicks<br/>- an unwise &quot;bargain&quot; fancy optical mouse!)</p><p>Change anything, and if the program is a bit delicate because of a bug,<br/>there is then a possibility it could crash.</p><p>&gt; I&apos;ll try the most recent beta, hopefully this evening (NYC time)...</p><p>Thanks again,</p><p>I am just doing another upload of the beta right now this minute.</p><p>Has option to play drones now, for Scottish bagpipes, or Sitar.</p><p>Robert</p></div><h3><a id=16000 href="#16000">ðŸ”—</a>Joseph Pehrson &#x3C;josephpehrson@compuserve.com&#x3E;</h3><span>11/28/2000 6:43:05 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@egroups.com">tuning@egroups.com</a>, &quot;Robert Walker&quot; &lt;robert_walker@r...&gt; wrote:</p><p><a href="http://www.egroups.com/message/tuning/15998">http://www.egroups.com/message/tuning/15998</a></p><p>Hi Robert...</p><p>Well, I just downloaded the new beta Smithy right now.  It&apos;s 9:40PM<br/>New York time, so it means it&apos;s 3:40AM your time...  Gee, you work<br/>really late... or EARLY!</p><p>Ummm.  It crashes again.
