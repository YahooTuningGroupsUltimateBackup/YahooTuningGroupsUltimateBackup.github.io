The frets are individual for each string,<br/>in other words, six of them placed at the same position would<br/>look like a regular fret.  But because they slide in the grooves,<br/>they may be placed anywhere on the fretboard.  I&apos;m not sure<br/>how many frets there are, but I think there are at least 30<br/>(for each string, that is).</p><p>To play quarter-tone music, Wim simply places the frets evenly<br/>across all six strings, with a set between each of the regular<br/>fret positions, to give 24 audibly-equal divisions of the &apos;octave&apos;<br/>on each string.  From a distance, it looks like a &apos;regular&apos;<br/>refretted guitar.</p><p>Tuning the guitar to play in just-intonation, which he used<br/>for the Spanish Renaissance pieces, is easy:  he just plays<br/>harmonics and moves the frets to give notes that are in tune<br/>with the harmonics.</p><p>Dowland&apos;s tuning is much more complex, and Wim uses an electronic<br/>tuner to speed the process.  [Plug alert]  I&apos;ve got an explanation<br/>and diagram of the complete Dowland lute fretboard on my website:</p><p><a href="http://www.ixpres.com/interval/monzo/fngrbds/dowland/dowland.htm">http://www.ixpres.com/interval/monzo/fngrbds/dowland/dowland.htm</a></p><p>I&apos;m working on a MIDI sequence of Dowland&apos;s _Lachrymae_, one<br/>of the pieces Wim plays, in this tuning, which will go up on<br/>my site.  There are several MIDI versions of it available on<br/>the web in regular 12-eq tuning.</p><p>Of course, when the frets are placed for JI or a non-equal<br/>temperament (Dowland&apos;s tuning could be defined as both),<br/>they are staggered all over the fretboard.</p><p>There is a description of either this guitar or one like<br/>in an old issue of _1/1_ from the early or mid 1990s.<br/>I believe it was an advertisement.  Sorry I don&apos;t have<br/>more details on getting this info, but I think SEJIS has<br/>all the _1/1_s.  Rummage around, you should find it.<br/>I&apos;ll also ask Wim for more details.</p><p>-monz</p><p>Joseph L.
