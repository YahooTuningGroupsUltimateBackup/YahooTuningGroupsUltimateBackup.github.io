This especially goes for the microtonal musics of the East. From my recent survey, pitch-cluster zones within the whole-tone continuum<br/>should amount to 35 cents in width if we are to take the Pythagorean 12-tone system as the reference for Western staff notation. This equates to dividing each half-tone into roughly 3 regions.</p><p>Cordially,<br/>Ozan Yarman<br/>  ----- Original Message -----<br/>  From: Carl Lumma<br/>  To: <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a><br/>  Sent: 29 Kas&imath;m 2004 Pazartesi 18:19<br/>  Subject: Re: [tuning] Cents Notation</p><p>  &gt;Hi everyone,<br/>  &gt;The Sagittal notation system is interesting to be<br/>  &gt;sure, but nothing is ever said about the &quot;cents&quot;<br/>  &gt;system advocated by Johnny Reinhard and the many<br/>  &gt;musicians he works with who use it for microtonal<br/>  &gt;performance.</p><p>  I said something about it just the other day.</p><p>  &gt;When my computer is finally up<br/>  &gt;and running and my generalized keyboard returns from<br/>  &gt;the Starrlabs repair shop,</p><p>  Hey, what went wrong with it?</p><p>  &gt;one way or another I&apos;m<br/>  &gt;going to figure out how to notate my music in<br/>  &gt;alignment with the musicians who will one day perform<br/>  &gt;it.

While the results of performance<br/>indicate wide usage of a band-width in Asian musics, and perhaps other musics, cents<br/>notation is for specific tunings with discrete points of reference.  A player<br/>an always round upwards or downwards for musical reasons from a specific<br/>pitch point, and vibrato can certainly be in play, as well (depending on the<br/>style).  Are you suggesting that symbols are inherently more likely to determine a<br/>band width interpretation than cents?  (I guess that is possible.)</p><p>I have really enjoyed reading of alternaties in notation on this list.  I<br/>think we all realize that there really aren&apos;t any &quot;universals&quot; in notation.  A<br/>read of Gardner Read&apos;s &quot;Microtonal Notation&quot; is clear on that issue.</p><p>However, if actual players are asked to perform multiple tunings on a single<br/>concert, or in a single career, then cents notation is ideal for speed and<br/>accuracy, if only for specific systems and not all approaches.  I&apos;m not sure I<br/>understand how the band width idea makes cents &quot;not subtle enough&quot; when symbols<br/>for intervals are just as easily misread.</p><p>best, Johnny Reinhard</p></div><h3><a id=56324 href="#56324">ðŸ”—</a>Ozan Yarman &#x3C;ozanyarman@superonline.com&#x3E;</h3><span>11/29/2004 11:50:09 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Dear Johnny,</p><p>It&apos;s a pleasure to make your acquaintance. Yes, I agree with you that there is no &grave;universals&grave; in notation except practical concerns. For this reason, I am very eager to preserve the 3-limit Phytagorean 12 Tone temperament as the basis for Western Staff Notation where the regular sharps and flats can be made to correspond with a zone encompassing all the intervals approximating the authentic apotome and limma.</p><p>Indeed, I&apos;m suggesting that the sharp and flat symbols determine a bandwidth roughly between 70 to 130 cents away from the natural. In order to avoid confusion, I have divided 9:8 into 6 firm regions, each 34 cents wide and attributed them acknowledged symbols resembling the sharp and flat.
