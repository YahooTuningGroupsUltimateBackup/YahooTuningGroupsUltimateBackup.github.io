If you<br/>saw it at U of I in the late 50&apos;s, then this is the same recording<br/>from that production, which Partch produced on his Gate 5 label.</p><p>I know Enclosure 5 intimately: I did the analog to digital transfers<br/>from Partch&apos;s archival tapes for a number of the selections on this<br/>set, and I also was happy that Philip Blackburn was able to track<br/>down, 17 years after we recorded it, our performance of &quot;The<br/>Bewitched&quot; in Cologne, Germany, from 1981. I would say it rocks the<br/>house, but then again I had a great time that night and could hardly<br/>be called objective. :)</p><p>If you want to be fetishistic about &quot;Revelation&quot;, I may have an extra<br/>copy of the Tomato (Philadelphia 1987 production) recording. While it<br/>is sonically pretty good (nice space), it has it&apos;s own ensemble<br/>wrinkles (this Rev was my last performance with a Partch instrument,<br/>until tomorrow that is). It might be worth having for the booklet<br/>alone, which was nicely produced; you can also find copies on eBay<br/>fairly frequently.</p><p>There&apos;s a bunch of Partch and Partch-related news to share in the<br/>upcoming days, so I&apos;ll leave it at this for now. Happy listening to<br/>E5!</p><p>Cheers,</p><p>Jon</p></div><h3><a id=42233 href="#42233">ðŸ”—</a>wallyesterpaulrus &#x3C;wallyesterpaulrus@yahoo.com&#x3E; &#x3C;wallyesterpaulrus@yahoo.com&#x3E;</h3><span>2/8/2003 12:14:36 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;Carl Lumma &lt;clumma@y...&gt;&quot;<br/>&lt;clumma@y...&gt; wrote:</p><p>&gt; You might also look into the Tomato release.

I think Revelation, as his other uses of<br/>traditional wind instruments, simply notates in 12 and then uses his<br/>system of colored lines above or below the note (for raising or<br/>lowering) and relies on the performer to tune the interval<br/>appropriately in relation to the pitch field around them.</p><p>&gt; I pulled it, along with Enclosure V.  In neither version does</p><p>&gt; the brass band really pull of good JI, but the earlier band</p><p>&gt; does seem to get a bit closer (the harmonic series lines in the</p><p>&gt; Fanfare and March of Chorus One, for example).</p><p>This is one of the areas that the gulf between theory/talking about<br/>microtonal music and actually performing it is wide: in both<br/>productions, but *especially* the Philly one in 1987, rehearsal time<br/>is precious, and while the performers on the Partch instruments were<br/>involved in weeks of rehearsals (and therefore got in deep into the<br/>subtleties), the band was brought in towards the end, and not all were<br/>able to adjust to the new intonation as well as one would like. In a<br/>perfect world, it could happen.</p><p>In recording, it is certainly a noticeable (to the right people) flaw;<br/>in performance, the band was a more than respectable part of the<br/>pageantry, which is probably the more important point: the drama of<br/>the performance supercedes any collection of pitches, if one or the<br/>other has to suffer.</p><p>&gt; The real treat of Enclosure V, though, must be Oedipus, which must</p><p>&gt; stand as a cornerstone of 20th century art.</p><p>Shame is that not many people see Oedipus that way.
