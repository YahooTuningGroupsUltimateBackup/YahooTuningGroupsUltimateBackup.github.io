Whilst reading the<br/>article which one of you had directed me to (you must forgive me - I<br/>can&apos;t remember whether it was Gene, Carl or Monzo) I learnt exactly<br/>the nature of the beast. Until then I had been labouring under the<br/>false understanding, acquired at school 40 years ago, that hearing is<br/>a purely passive process. As it turns out there are active vibrators<br/>in the inner ear that act as amplifiers for speech pitches to enable<br/>speech to be more easily distinguished against a noisy background.<br/>These cells normally vibrate just below the threshold of hearing.<br/>While reading Dr Braun&apos;s article I suddenly realized what had been<br/>happening all along. Although it may be just one of those incredible<br/>coincidences, almost as the truth dawned upon me, my tinnitus (12kHz<br/>@ 40db) attenuated and for the past six days has been practically<br/>inaudible, having been continuous for the preceding ten years. I have<br/>even been able to resume work upon my little symphony. But I digress<br/>because in relating this to Dr. Braun I also asked about &apos;absolute<br/>pitch&apos;. Here is his response to that question:-</p><p>&quot;Before writing in more detail, just one piece of good news. No worry<br/>about the &apos;absoluteness&apos; of 440 Hz. Nobody in science, and, as far as<br/>I know, no scholar of other theories, thinks that 440 Hz has any<br/>particular importance in biology or physics.</p><p>&quot;440 Hz is just a technical norm and it is independent from absolute<br/>pitch in humans. The term &apos;absolute&apos; here refers to any possible<br/>matrix of tone memories. Of course, if people, like in many parts of<br/>the world now, are exposed to a tone matrix based on A = 440 Hz<br/>several hours per day over years, their implicit and explicit tone<br/>memory is formed accordingly.&quot;</p><p>Peter</p></div><h3><a id=50196 href="#50196">ðŸ”—</a>Carl Lumma &#x3C;ekin@lumma.org&#x3E;</h3><span>12/20/2003 1:38:49 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>&gt;&quot;440 Hz is just a technical norm and it is independent from absolute<br/>&gt;pitch in humans.
