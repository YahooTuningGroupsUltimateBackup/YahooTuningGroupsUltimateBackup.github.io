Its on Harmonia Mundi. It<br/>is an attempt to reanimate alot of the existing fragments of greek music<br/>notation. They seem to have built a hugue arsenal of instruments based on<br/>depictions in art and the voice is always doubled by an instrument, so the<br/>intonation is exact. The tunings are fascinating and seem to have all the<br/>genera, although the liner notes are unfortunetly not very explicit. All in<br/>all, a really interesting CD!</p><p>And a not so interesting CD...</p><p>I also got Terry Rileys &quot;Lisbon Concert&quot;. I couldnt tell what it was from<br/>the cover, but since one of the tracks was called &quot;15/16&quot; I thought for<br/>sure it would be interesting. Unfortunetly  the cd consists of someone of<br/>very mediocre cocktail piano ability noodling on a &gt;equal tempered&lt; piano.<br/>Oh well, you can&apos;t win &apos;em all...</p><p>dante</p><p>ps- Actually I think the Riley piano noodlings are somewhat more congenial<br/>than Keith Jarrets ego-the-size-of-the-universe noodlings. I just wish the<br/>piano had been justly tuned.</p></div>
