If anybody has a great idea, I<br/>would certainly be interested in hearing it.   I am not sure what &quot;special<br/>emphasis&apos; means in this context.<br/>Thanks,<br/>Ed Foote</p><p>&gt;&gt;I. I need a particular scale that stresses (gives special emphasis to the</p><p>9th minor [i.e. C-Db] and 7th major [C-H] and also 4th and tritonos [4th+].</p><p>II. I don&apos;t know if it has never exclusively been thought for a piano, I&apos;d</p><p>like that scales from C to H would not be &quot;parallele&quot;, that is with a</p><p>frequency always doubled, but, between C and the next, there would always be</p><p>a constant being out of tune, with an excess of a bit less of 1/4 tone.</p><p>My intention is to prepare a piano with particular values of frequency</p><p>already given, i.e. betweeen the former note [A0] and the latter [C8] here</p><p>would not be more than a tone (considering the possible breaking of the</p><p>strings).&lt;&lt;</p></div>
