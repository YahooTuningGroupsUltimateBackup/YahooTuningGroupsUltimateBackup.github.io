The interesting thing to me was how the music in these films<br/>affected my involvement with the story...PB&apos;s music (by Graeme Revel)<br/>was very well done, eerie, actually felt alien...I often couldn&apos;t tell<br/>what instruments were being used. Mission to Mars, on the other hand,<br/>had one of the worst scores I&apos;ve heard in years...not only was it very<br/>cliched musically, but it actually destroyed the feeling in many scenes<br/>because it seemed like the music had nothing to do with what was<br/>happening. This is a factor that critics rarely mention, but in this<br/>case, it really affected the way I perceived the action...Hstick</p></div>
