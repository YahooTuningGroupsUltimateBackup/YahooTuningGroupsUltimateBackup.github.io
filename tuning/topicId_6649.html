In theory, one could do an<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt;FFT, move the peaks, then do a reverse FFT, but I doubt the sound would<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt;survive intact.  Does anybody know how good this kind of trick can get,<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt;and who, if anybody, does it?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; [Bill Sethares, TD 416.1:]<br/>&gt; &gt;this was the topic of my paper in the computer music journal from<br/>&gt; &gt;january of last year called &quot;consonance based spectral mappings&quot; -<br/>&gt; &gt;whether you moves the partials to make the sound more consonant or not,<br/>&gt; &gt;the spectral mapping techniques do allow a fair bit of re-tuning<br/>&gt; &gt;and re-timbre-ing, though there will be audible side effects<br/>&gt; &gt;if you move the partials very far.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Bill, this is too kyool!!  Do you mean to say you could retune, say,<br/>&gt; one of Jay&apos;s tracks of Christmas music?  How much CPU does that take?</p><p>Here&apos;s how I&apos;ve managed to do this: Csound can perform pretty good<br/>analysis/resynthesis of a harmonic sound, by heterodyne partial tracking.<br/>An analysis file is created that tracks each partial&apos;s pitch and amplitude<br/>variations over time--this is the &quot;hetro&quot; utility--and resynthesis is done<br/>by driving sine waves with this data--using the &quot;adsyn&quot; opcode.</p><p>Within Csound, the only controls available at resynthesis time are overall<br/>pitch, amplitude and playback speed.  But I wrote a little utility that<br/>retunes the partials in the analysis file *before* resynthesis, outside of<br/>Csound. You can specify which equal-temperament you want, and it will map<br/>the partials to pitches in that temperament, preserving all the amplitude<br/>data, and pitch variation relative to the average for each track, present<br/>in the original, and then rewriting a new data file that Csound can read<br/>for resynthesis. It works pretty well--or actually I should say &quot;worked&quot;,<br/>because I haven&apos;t got it up and running since moving to a PC platform. I<br/>originally compiled and ran it on an SGI. If anyone&apos;s interested I can<br/>send you a copy to tinker with - it&apos;s in vanilla C, uncommented. You can<br/>also flatten frequency variation within each partial, or exaggerate it<br/>with respect to the average.  This worked really well with vocal samples.<br/>One thing I found that people really liked when I played it for them, was<br/>mapping partials onto 6-tone equal temperament, to create a whole-tone<br/>timbre. Far less interesting than almost any other temperament, but it<br/>didn&apos;t sound &quot;out of tune&quot; to the masses.</p><p>best wishes --Jon Wild</p></div><h3><a id=6659 href="#6659">ðŸ”—</a>alves@xxxxx.xx.xxx.xxxxxxxxxxxxxxx)</h3><span>12/6/1999 11:42:39 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>&gt;Within Csound, the only controls available at resynthesis time are overall<br/>&gt;pitch, amplitude and playback speed.

You can then edit this file and translate<br/>it back into the analysis file with Mr. Tweaky. I sampled a large Buddhist<br/>bell (densho), analyzed it with hetro, translated the file to text with Mr.<br/>Tweaky, tweaked all the partials in a text editor so that they lay in the<br/>tuning system I was using, translated them back into an analysis file with<br/>Mr. Tweaky, and read that file into my Csound orchestra with adsyn. The<br/>result was great. As an added bonus, all the ambient noise of the recording<br/>was gone, since hetro only tracks the partials that appear over a certain<br/>threshold. The result is in my JI piece for shakuhachi and tape, In-yo,<br/>which, by the way, is on the CD of the International Computer Music<br/>Conference &apos;99.</p><p>Bill</p><p>^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^<br/>^ Bill Alves                                      email: <a href="mailto:alves@hmc.edu">alves@hmc.edu</a> ^<br/>^ Harvey Mudd College                 URL: <a href="http://www2.hmc.edu/~alves/">http://www2.hmc.edu/~alves/</a> ^<br/>^ 301 E.
