As we have seen, for 11-limit JI, 72-tET is fine,*<br/>so 144-tET can&apos;t hurt. But we should also be able to represent other<br/>&quot;kingdoms&quot;:<br/>meantone and Erlich decatonic (~22tET) stuff, and maybe Blackwood decatonic<br/>(~15-tET) and tetradecatonic (~26-tET) stuff. In 144-tET, one also has<br/>708.33-cent fifths, great for the Erlich stuff. The next smaller fifths in<br/>144-tET<br/>after the 700-cent ones are the 691.67-cent fifths, at the extreme other end<br/>of<br/>the meantone spectrum. That&apos;s great for tetradecatonic stuff, but no real<br/>meantone has such small fifths. It would be nice to have another fifth<br/>halfway<br/>in-between. Years ago on this list I proposed 288-tET for these very<br/>reasons.<br/>But 288-tET is not consistent with 11-limit JI, we&apos;ve lost any reason to<br/>hold onto<br/>72-tET. So let&apos;s backtrack.</p><p>Starting with multiples of 12-tET again (due to cultural habit), 612-tET<br/>(=12*17*3) presents itself. It was recommended by Bosanquet for its<br/>0.01-cent-error 3-limit approximations and 0.04-cent-max-error 5-limit<br/>approximations, and it happens to be consistent in the 11-limit with more<br/>accuracy than any ET mentioned in this entire article. The gradations are<br/>fine enough that a fifth suitable for any type of scale is guaranteed.<br/>However, 17ths of a semitone would be hard to calculate with, reckon or<br/>notate.</p><p>The exactly defined non-JI intervals we need the most are 1/5-octave (for<br/>Blackwood decatonic stuff and since we already have 1/2-octave, 1/3-octave,<br/>and 1/4-octave). That tells us we should work with a multiple of 60tET. The<br/>first two multiples of 60tET that are consistent with the 11-limit are<br/>480tET, 540tET, and 1200tET. The latter is cents, already used as notation<br/>for Johnny Reinhard and the American Festival of Microtonal Music, and in<br/>analysis by most of us. 480tET (=12*5*2*2*2) is a good choice too. 1/5-comma<br/>meantone is 697.65 cents, 1/3-comma is 694.79 cents, the ~22tET decatonic<br/>stuff suggests a fifth of around 709 cents, while the ~26tET tetradecatonic<br/>stuff suggests a fifth of 692.31 cents; 480tET gives 697.5, 695, 710, and<br/>692.5 respectively. Meanwhile, 540tET (=12*5*3*3) gives two good varieties<br/>of meantone, one close to 1/5-comma and 43-tET, and the other close to<br/>LucyTuning; a more tolerable 693.33-cent tetradecatonic fifth, and a superb<br/>708.89-cent decatonic fifth. Furthermore, 540-tET contains the amazingly<br/>good JI (through the 13-limit!) approximations of 270-tET, which Paul Hahn<br/>has made note of before. The fascinating 27-tET is present too should anyone<br/>find a good use for it.</p><p>Although using cents on the score can give musicians, particularly those not<br/>trained to produce hundreds of intervals accurately, a false sense of<br/>security, there is a major advantage to microtonal notation systems based on<br/>numerals. Most people already know how to add and subtract numbers, and most<br/>musicians know how to add and subtract 12-tET degrees. Thus the intervals in<br/>a score will never be far from a musician&apos;s mind if the microtonal<br/>alterations are numeric. With six steps to a semitone a glyph systems like<br/>Sims&apos; or Herf&apos;s allows easy enough calculation. But with 40, 45, or 100,<br/>numbers seem the way to go.</p><p>Let&apos;s forget about 12-tET and see what else we can find. A great<br/>representation of the pitch continuum is 342-tET (2*171). It&apos;s 19*3*3*2, so<br/>contains 19tET, which is close to 1/3-comma meantone and could serve as a<br/>basis for the notation (possibly even with a glyph system). It&apos;s even better<br/>in the 11-limit than 270 &amp; 540-tET (0.44 cents max error vs. 0.74 cents),<br/>much better than 480-tET (1.19 cents max error), and it has a great<br/>decatonic fifth of 708.77 cents and a good approximation of 1/6-comma<br/>meantone (and a 691.23-cent fifth OK for tetradecatonics). Renewing an<br/>interest in 1/5-octaves, 400-tET is also better in the 11-limit than 270 &amp;<br/>540-tET, and has decatonic, meantone, and tetradecatonic fifths of 708, 696,<br/>and 693 cents, respectively. 400 is 50*8, so can be notated considering<br/>50-tET (with its 696-cent fifths) as meantone, with a glyph system to<br/>indicate halves, quarters, and eighths of these steps. The problem with that<br/>is that notating 50-tET as meantone would require a quadruple sharp or a<br/>quadruple flat somewhere and so might not be as concise as one would hope.</p><p>I must admit that I haven&apos;t found anything with steps larger than 4 cents<br/>that really looks better than 144-tET.</p><p>*One could learn 72-tET as follows. Start with 12-tET. Learn 1/4-tones by<br/>playing Arabic stuff, and listening to the essentially just 11:8, 11:6, and<br/>11:9 intervals that 1/4-tones make with 12-tET. (6:8:9:11 chords are great<br/>for this purpose). Then learn the 1/6-tones of 36-tET by playing the<br/>essentially just 7:4, 7:6, and 7:9 intervals that 1/6-tones make with<br/>12-tET. 1/12-tones can be learned by playing just 5:4, 5:3, and 5:9<br/>intervals starting with 12-tET, and also as the spaces between 1/6-tones and<br/>1/4-tones. Now one should have a total, integrated grasp of 72-tET and<br/>11-limit JI.</p></div><h3>David J.
