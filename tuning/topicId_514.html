Now that&apos;s a band wagon I can jump on.  I&apos;d been turning over<br/>in my mind a few possible ways to say, validly, that math has nothing<br/>to do with music.  Every one had a catch.  But this works: there is no<br/>causal relationship between math and music.  Finally it becomes clear.</p><p>&gt; Music (oddly enough) seems to be one of the last of the great<br/>&gt; cultural taboos which remains in force in Western culture --<br/>&gt; it is one of the few completely untouchable subjects, whose<br/>&gt; udnerlying cultural preconceptions cannot be questioned<br/>&gt; and cannot be doubted.  In Western cultures almost every<br/>&gt; other cutlural taboo has come under fire and become<br/>&gt; malleable -- adultery, once a hanging offense, now<br/>&gt; merely qulaifies the woman or the man for a shot on<br/>&gt; Oprah (if famous enough). Sex with women under the<br/>&gt; age of 21, once the ultimate forbidden horror in America,<br/>&gt; is now so common it does not deserve discussion. Drinking<br/>&gt; liquor, once forbidden in manys states, is pretty much accepted<br/>&gt; everywhere in America except Utah.  Gambling, once the<br/>&gt; demon and forbidden scourge of North America, has been embraced<br/>&gt; by every state, legalized,  and provides vast revenues from New York<br/>&gt; to California.</p><p>I see no need to associate the overthrow of traditional music theory<br/>with the overthrow of morality.  While I&apos;m all for questioning the<br/>music establishment, I cannot condone the general moral breakdown<br/>occurring in Western culture.  I believe that mankind&apos;s greatest good<br/>and highest goal is to please God, and I believe that the Bible is the<br/>Word of God.  Math-based music theories don&apos;t have any direct moral<br/>meaning, and so may be freely questioned or done away with altogether,<br/>if need be.</p><p>&gt;     The great story in music theory over the last 15 years has<br/>&gt; been the increasing realization that ALL (and I do mean all!)<br/>&gt; prescriptive music theories are simply worthless.  They<br/>&gt; consistently fail.  They constantly blow up.  They collapse<br/>&gt; into contradiction with the actual practices of real composers<br/>&gt; in the real world to a startlingly uniform degree.</p><p>Why didn&apos;t we all recognize this in music school (those of us who<br/>went), when, upon trying to complete music analysis assignments for<br/>theory class, we constantly ran up against inherent logical<br/>contradictions?  It was as plain as the nose on Beethoven&apos;s bust, but<br/>we couldn&apos;t see it.</p><p>I think I see now, Brian, why you&apos;re swinging your axe so hard.  You<br/>have quite a massive wall to break down.  Just the same, it might be<br/>even more effective to plant little seeds in the cracks of the wall<br/>and give them time to grow, destroying the wall slowly but invincibly.</p><p>David</p></div><h3><a id=530 href="#530">ðŸ”—</a>Kraig Grady &#x3C;kraiggrady@...&#x3E;</h3><span>7/18/2001 12:10:30 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>A few short responses to the wayward over the last week or two</p><p>Notice that practically the only types of child prodigies are in math<br/>and music. there couldn&apos;t possibly be a relation</p><p>to dismiss lattices as a tool is synonymous with a blind man attempting<br/>to  get sight by becoming blind drunk.<br/>How is ignorance a beneficial . also lets hear where a lattice is a<br/>problem and this have anything to do with bad music.<br/>It is like saying that not knowing where major/minor chords are on the<br/>piano<br/>will make better tonal music</p><p>Since having no root in the nature of sound what could be more<br/>mathematical and arbitrary than an ET. There is no culture on the globe<br/>that has not developed  it music along acoustical properties. This is<br/>obvious when you consider they are tuned by ear not by the overheated<br/>logic based minds of a civilization that no matter what the terrain,<br/>places its fence post equally distant apart. ET is the imagination of<br/>the cattle rancher.</p><p>30 years ago i remember hearing arguments how electronics could produce<br/>instruments whose timbre was uniform from top to bottom. Once we had it,<br/>it was horrible. Now we go through great lengths to create scaling<br/>differances in volume and timbre over the instruments to make them sound<br/>better. The same variation is necessary with intervals.</p><p>Why would you want a scale that you can&apos;t add or subtract to without<br/>destroying<br/>it very nature</p><p>To say that there are no JI intervals in nature is like saying that<br/>because there are  no absolutely pure geometric shapes in rocks crystals<br/>they don&apos;t exist since in their forming, there is always some<br/>distortion.</p><p>Likewise if we take recordings of people playing the drums, we will<br/>notice that there are discrepancies that show that the beat is off, thus<br/>tempo and beats are not based on whole number relations. ridiculous.</p><p>Notice that noone ever says they hear a simple ratio as a more complex<br/>one. a matter of learning? why do i not mistake a 5/4 for a 12 et third<br/>yet players if holding a chord will do the opposite.</p><p>Just as gestalt psychology has shown us that Squares , triangles, and<br/>other geometric forms are natural products of the mind, why is the<br/>notion that such forms in our sense of hearing such a threat.</p><p>-- Kraig Grady<br/>North American Embassy of Anaphoria island<br/> <a href="http://www.anaphoria.com">http://www.anaphoria.com</a></p><p>The Wandering Medicine Show<br/>Wed. 8-9 KXLU 88.9 fm</p></div>
