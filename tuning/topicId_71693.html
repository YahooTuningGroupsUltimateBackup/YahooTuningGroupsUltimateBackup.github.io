I LIKE<br/>it...]</p><p>Yes, it&apos;s a disaster, especially for JI!</p><p>BUT it can be used VERY effectively for cheesy and sentimental effect,<br/>like movie manipulation of audience emotion...sort-of Orson Welles-ish<br/>cinema, at best. Just off-the-cuff. Remember, I said I like it, first.<br/>Or, I don&apos;t know, ... Cocteau Twins? Hendrix and [his] flanging?</p><p>Seriously, I think it tends to fatally obscure any intervallic<br/>messages that don&apos;t come from chordal sort-of &apos;washes&apos;. The<br/>idiosynchracies of doubling and serendipitous or xenogamous<br/>&apos;mistuning&apos;/detuning are MUCH more interesting.</p><p>It makes everything sound like Major Seventh chords!
