As a theme for<br/>this work, he _extracted the musical note-names_ from the names of<br/>himself, Anton Webern and Arnold Sch&ouml;nberg. Interpreting H as B, B as<br/>B-flat and S as E-flat,ingeniously.</p><p>What i found most interesting, however, was that Arnold Sch&ouml;nberg&apos;s<br/>theme-which came out as A D Eb C B Bb E G, contained no repeated<br/>notes. Which was an amazing coincidence for the grand father of twelve<br/>tone theory.</p><p>So this name-theme could itself be turned into a true twelve tone<br/>series with the addition of four other notes. Which would be C#, F, F#<br/>and Ab. I examined this for a while, concluding that there wasn&apos;t<br/>really any permutation of those four notes that made more sense than<br/>any other to add to the original eight notes, which made it rather<br/>meaningless to try. Until i considered Sch&ouml;nberg&apos;s own favored method<br/>of the inversional matrix.</p><p>In a inversional matrix, the basic 12-tone row is printed out<br/>horisontally in twelve lines, transposed to each note of it&apos;s<br/>_inversion_ . This gives an easy overview over both inverted and<br/>original forms for the composer, allowing the viewer to find whatever<br/>chords and interval series he&apos;s looking for- as long as they&apos;re<br/>present in any form of the series.</p><p>So i decided to apply this process to the original eight note row of<br/>Sch&ouml;nberg&apos;s name, giving this matrix:</p><p>A  D  Eb C  B  Bb E  G<br/>E  A  Bb G  F# F  B  D<br/>Eb Ab A  F# F  E  Bb C#<br/>F# B  C  A  Ab G  C# E<br/>G  C  C# Bb A  Ab D  F<br/>Ab C# D  B  Bb A  Eb F#<br/>D  G  Ab F  E  Eb A  C<br/>B  E  F  D  C# C  F# A</p><p>This eventually resulted in a finished work for cello and piano, a<br/>clever homage to Sch&ouml;nberg in multiple ways. Curiously enough, i ended<br/>up using a lot of the &quot;diagonal&quot; chords, which wouldn&apos;t be considered<br/>part of any proper serial treatment.</p><p>So what is the relevance to microtonality here? Well, the inversional<br/>matrix can be applied to ANY set of intervals, not only tone rows,<br/>they don&apos;t even have to be in a equal temperament. In fact... if 8<br/>notes from the overtone series is used, the result is a proper<br/>Tonality Diamond!</p><p>1/1   9/8   5/4   11/8  3/2   13/8  7/4   15/8<br/>16/9  1/1   10/9  11/9  4/3   13/9  14/9  5/3<br/>8/5   9/5   1/1   11/10 6/5   13/10 7/5   3/2<br/>16/11 18/11 20/11 1/1   12/11 13/11 14/11 15/11<br/>4/3   3/2   5/3   11/6  1/1   13/12 7/6   5/4<br/>16/13 18/13 20/13 22/13 24/13 1/1   14/13 15/13<br/>8/7   9/7   10/7  11/7  12/7  13/7  1/1   15/14<br/>16/15 6/5   3/2   22/15 5/4   26/15 15/14 1/1</p><p>But when the overtones (which are still just an example of what<br/>intervals could be used) are put in a different order, it gets much<br/>more interesting:</p><p>1/1   11/8  5/4   7/4   9/8   13/8   3/2   15/8<br/>16/11 1/1   20/11 14/11 18/11 13/11  24/11 15/11<br/>8/5   11/10 1/1   7/5   9/5   13/10  6/5   3/2<br/>8/7   11/7  10/7  1/1   9/7   13/7   12/7  15/7<br/>16/9  11/9  10/9  14/9  1/1   13/9   4/3   5/3<br/>16/13 22/13 20/13 14/13 18/13 1/1    24/13 15/13<br/>4/3   11/6  5/3   7/6   3/2   13/12  1/1   5/4<br/>16/15 22/15 4/3   28/15 6/5   26/15  8/5   1/1</p><p>I hope i&apos;m making clear the compositional possibilities available here.</p><p>/Mats &Ouml;ljare<br/>Eskilstuna, Sweden<br/><a href="http://oljare.iuma.com">http://oljare.iuma.com</a></p></div><h3>wallyesterpaulrus &#x3C;wallyesterpaulrus@yahoo.com&#x3E;</h3><span>3/30/2003 2:47:03 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, Mats &Ouml;ljare &lt;oljare@h...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; The following piece of theory goes back to one of my first<br/>&gt; compositions, so i&apos;ll give you the full story here.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; In 1995, i was reading a book about my then-favourite<br/>composer (and<br/>&gt; still one of my favourites) Alban Berg, including some<br/>theoretical<br/>&gt; notes for the Concerto for Piano, Violin and Winds.
