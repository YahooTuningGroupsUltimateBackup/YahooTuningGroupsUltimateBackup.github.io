In any case, Kraig clarified,<br/>saying that his response to my post was not about me<br/>(or, as far as I can tell, about what I had said<br/>originally).  If Partch is a fad, it&apos;s probably the<br/>best fad around, and I wouldn&apos;t worry too much if a<br/>lot of people misunderstand his work; it stands on<br/>its own.

One would also hope that the badly done<br/>attempts won&apos;t forever take you away from an interest in non-abstract<br/>music, but the main point is that any era will have it&apos;s share of<br/>ineptitudes and charlatans.
