Erlich&quot; &lt;<a href="mailto:PErlich@Acadian-Asset.com">PErlich@Acadian-Asset.com</a>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt;Are you playing _microtonal_ guitar?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt;Given all the discussion of the terms &quot;microtone&quot; and &quot;microtonal&quot;, that<br/>&gt;&gt;depends on whom you ask. I&apos;m playing a 12tet Martin D-35 that I&apos;ve owned<br/>&gt;&gt;since 1972.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;Great. I have some nice 12-tET guitars (including a Martin) too and I&apos;ll be<br/>&gt;playing them at a gig on Saturday. Do you think it would be appropriate if I<br/>&gt;advertised that gig here? I&apos;d definitely like to, but what is this list<br/>&gt;about? There are 340 people here now; do we really have room for everyone&apos;s<br/>&gt;&quot;extracurriculars&quot;?</p><p>If your gig were close to where I live I&apos;d probably come by to hear you<br/>play, and I suspect a lot of others on the list would do so, too. I don&apos;t<br/>know about the number 340. There certainly aren&apos;t that many people sending<br/>messages to the list.  And an awful lot of the messages that are sent to<br/>the list are pretty inane and probably much less worthwhile to the<br/>subscribers than any announcement of musical performances by subscribers.<br/>For example, all of the messages that say something like &quot;rolling on the<br/>floor laughing&quot; or &quot;I liked that joke&quot;. And not so long ago several<br/>subscribers were taking swipes at capitalism and I don&apos;t recall any message<br/>from you suggesting that that was innappropriate. So I find it odd that you<br/>complain about an announcement of a musical performance by one of the<br/>subscribers. And whether we use the term &quot;microtonal&quot; or &quot;alternate tuning&quot;<br/>or &quot;tuning&quot; or anything else, I assumed that every one on this list was<br/>interested in MUSIC! Maybe I was wrong.</p><p>Is there a policy of what is acceptable on the list? I&apos;ve never received any.</p><p>Comments from anybody else?</p><p>John Link</p><p>*************************************************************************</p><p>Watch for the CD &quot;Live at Saint Peter&apos;s&quot; by John Link&apos;s vocal quintet,<br/>featuring original compositions as well as arrangements of instrumental<br/>music by Chick Corea, Miles Davis, Claude Debussy, Bill Evans, Ennio and<br/>Andrea Morricone, Modeste Mussorgsky, Erik Satie, and Earl Zindars.</p><p>*************************************************************************</p></div><h3><a id=6716 href="#6716">ðŸ”—</a>Paul H.

I wasn&apos;t around when you were attacked for<br/>playing 12-tET, and certainly wouldn&apos;t join in such nonsense, even though<br/>my singers sometimes complain about the 12-tET I play for them. My play, a<br/>few blocks from Times Square, finishes about 10:30, so I won&apos;t be able to<br/>check out your band. But I hope subscribers nearby will go and give us a<br/>report.</p><p>John Link</p><p>P.S.
