What you say makes a lot of sense, I&apos;m just not sure it<br/>is true. After evolving some distinctive methods of composition, it<br/>seems to me that mostly what comes out of the process doesn&apos;t sound<br/>quite like what anyone else is doing, so I don&apos;t feel originality ends<br/>up being a problem. My biggest concern is to achieve a satisfactory<br/>level of unoriginality by means of traditional formal structures.</p><p>Anyway, compositions are cooking again, after I gave up for a while,<br/>so we shall see.</p></div><h3>steve parker &#x3C;steveparker@350.com&#x3E;</h3><span>4/6/2005 4:42:41 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>On 6/4/05 10:13 am, &quot;Gene Ward Smith&quot; &lt;<a href="mailto:gwsmith@svpal.org">gwsmith@svpal.org</a>&gt; wrote:</p><p>&gt; There&apos;s another &quot;tuning connection&quot; to it:  the problem of<br/>&gt;&gt; originality is one that eventually confronts every composer<br/>&gt;&gt; and every performer who seeks a more-than-karaoke<br/>&gt;&gt; imitation.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Thanks, Yahya.
