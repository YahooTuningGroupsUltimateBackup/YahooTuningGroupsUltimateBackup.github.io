At this point you would run into the next tone. Now if<br/>&gt; you allow 15 cents away as in the 25/24 you are more than half way to the<br/>&gt; 27 cent maximum. This means that any ratio would have more than a 50%<br/>&gt; chance of fitting. Don&apos;t you think this is a little all-inclusive?<br/>&gt;</p><p>Very good point. You are correct that the .01 term as an initial<br/>error term is fairly tolerant for 22tet.</p><p>And now I see how to choose a &apos;correct&apos; initial error term at<br/>less than half the width of the tone step.</p><p>This will give a justifiable mathematic best fit, and (I think)<br/>will result in all et notes getting unique ji notes assigned to them.</p><p>On the other hand, if one wanted the ji note that represented<br/>&quot;most likely to be heard as&quot; then this results in things that<br/>don&apos;t match what would be heard. Using an initial error term<br/>of only slightly more correctness for 31tet (.006)<br/>shows the note number 18 note being approximated first by</p><p>      18      : =118/79</p><p>rather than a 3/2, so there should be another function in there,<br/>constraining things to human pitch discrimination (30c?), looking<br/>at limits, or how much of a jump there is to the next<br/>approximation, etc.</p><p>And as I pondered in the rest of the mail, having unique ratios<br/>for each et note doesn&apos;t completely match the usage, since punning<br/>means exploiting two ratios represented by the same et step.</p><p>thanks,</p><p>Bob Valentine</p></div><h3><a id=4349 href="#4349">ðŸ”—</a>D.Stearns &#x3C;stearns@xxxxxxx.xxxx&#x3E;</h3><span>8/19/1999 10:06:45 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>[Robert C Valentine:]<br/>&gt;Using an initial error term of only slightly more correctness for<br/>31tet (.006) shows the note number 18 note being approximated first by</p><p>      18      : =118/79</p><p>rather than a 3/2, so there should be another function in there,<br/>constraining things to human pitch discrimination (30c?), looking at<br/>limits, or how much of a jump there is to the next  approximation,<br/>etc.</p><p>Using the (simple but arbitrary) .0 process I posted earlier this week<br/>(TD 284.4), 31e would look like this:</p><p>1/1 0&#xFFFD; 0.0</p><p>44/43 +1&#xFFFD; 0.03<br/>45/44  0&#xFFFD; 0.01<br/>46/45 -1&#xFFFD; 0.02<br/>47/46 -1&#xFFFD; 0.04</p><p>22/21 +3&#xFFFD; 0.04<br/>23/22  0&#xFFFD; 0.01</p><p>15/14 +3&#xFFFD; 0.0<br/>16/15 -4&#xFFFD; 0.0</p><p>12/11 -4&#xFFFD; 0.0</p><p>19/17 -1&#xFFFD; 0.0</p><p>8/7 -1&#xFFFD; 0.0</p><p>7/6 -4&#xFFFD; 0.0</p><p>6/5 6&#xFFFD; 0.0</p><p>11/9 -1&#xFFFD; 0.0</p><p>5/4 -1&#xFFFD; 0.0</p><p>9/7 +9&#xFFFD; 0.0</p><p>17/13 0&#xFFFD; 0.0</p><p>4/3 -5&#xFFFD; 0.0</p><p>15/11 -5&#xFFFD; 0.0</p><p>7/5 +2&#xFFFD; 0.0</p><p>Dan</p></div>
