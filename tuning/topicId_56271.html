Or along the same lines as your 123123123131 scale, you could use subsets with different numbers of 1-step, 2-step, and 3 step intervals (122232221222, 122321223212). The last of these scales is a subset of superpelog (see below).</p><p>&gt; 2) Has anyone used, or does anyone know of example works in 23-tet? Darreg &gt; refers to it as &apos;strange&apos;, but points out that it is rarely used.<br/>&gt;  &gt; Best,</p><p>Not specifically 23-tet, but I&apos;ve used a 14-note scale that I call &quot;superpelog&quot;, which can be tuned as a subset of 23-ET. The scale is produced by repeating a generator of approximately 261 cents, which is close to 5 steps of 23-ET.</p><p>generators       0  5 10  1  6 11  2  7 12  3  8 13  4  9  0<br/>degree of 23-ET  0  2  4  5  7  9 10 12 14 15 17 19 20 22 23</p><p>I call it &quot;superpelog&quot; because it has a number of pelog-sounding modes, two of which are similar to scales from the Scala archive that are attributed to (Erich) von Hornbostel: pelog_pa.scl and pelog_pb.scl. Easley Blackwood&apos;s 23-tet etude (from his _Twelve Microtonal Etudes for Electronic Music Media_, Op. 28) also takes advantage of the pelog modes of 23-et.</p><p>I have two MIDI samples of music in superpelog tuning: one is a retuning of a piece that I originally wrote in 14-ET: &quot;This Way to the Egress&quot;.</p><p><a href="http://www.io.com/~hmiller/midi/egress-superpelog.mid">http://www.io.com/~hmiller/midi/egress-superpelog.mid</a></p><p>I also have an unfinished excerpt that I wrote specifically for this tuning. Each instrument is playing notes from a different overlapping subset of the tuning, so no single instrument plays all 14 notes. You might want to consider using 12-note modes of 23-tet in a similar way.</p><p><a href="http://www.io.com/~hmiller/music/ex/mahali.mid">http://www.io.com/~hmiller/music/ex/mahali.mid</a></p></div><h3><a id=56274 href="#56274">ðŸ”—</a>Jacob &#x3C;jbarton@rice.edu&#x3E;</h3><span>11/19/2004 10:19:35 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;Aaron K.

A chain of<br/>260-cent super-seconds or sub-thirds or...  The whole thing requires 14 notes, but since<br/>it&apos;s a linearly generated sequence of notes you can just take the first 12:</p><p>2 3 2 1 2 2 1 2 2 1 2 1 3</p><p>or some such mode.  With this you can get these nice 5-note modes that sound remotely<br/>Indonesian.  Herman mentions a couple.</p><p>&gt; 2) Has anyone used, or does anyone know of example works in 23-tet?

And he says the 23-tone movement uses modes similar to slendro and<br/>pelog scales, modulated through a few keys.  The first one I hear is not mentioned by<br/>Herman, though: 7 3 3 7 3.</p></div>
