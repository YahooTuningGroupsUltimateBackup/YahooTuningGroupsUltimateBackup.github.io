If all voices and instruments only produced the<br/>&gt; first 6 harmonics, we&apos;d still have the same, infinite 5-limit JI lattice.<br/>&gt;</p><p>When the tones in that lattice are described as members of a harmonic series<br/>whose &quot;1&quot; is at the extreme southwest, it both (a) continues infinitely high<br/>up in that harmonic series, and indeed, (b) each successive term is larger<br/>than the corresponding successive term in a simple harmonic series.</p><p>I really think you&apos;re making the wrong argument with Haverstick. You could<br/>have written:</p><p>&quot;you don&apos;t need to use infinitely high factors to get an infinite JI set of<br/>pitches&quot; (trivial but true)<br/>or:<br/>&quot;with any small set of simple JI intervals, you can generate an infinite JI<br/>set of pitches&quot; (another way of saying the same)<br/>or<br/>&quot;JI systems can use a small set of simple intervals locally, generating a<br/>potentially infinite set of pitches globally&quot; (which starts to suggest how<br/>this works in real musics).</p></div>
