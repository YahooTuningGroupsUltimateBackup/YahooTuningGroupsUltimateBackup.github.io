Bach John did for me is wonderful to play<br/>along with. The harmonies are so crisp and<br/>clear.</p><p>I&apos;ve also listened to it in quarter comma<br/>meantone, and that is much nicer for this<br/>particular music than, say, WIII, but it<br/>is even clearer and nicer to play with<br/>when adaptively tuned, and it is quite<br/>striking for these pieces.</p><p>Might be an interesting idea to start<br/>with a n-tet scale, and then adaptively<br/>tune it - i.e. like usual adaptive tuning<br/>but with horizontal springs grounding to<br/>say 8-tet or 7-tet, and targetting<br/>7 limit or 11 limit ratios (in case of<br/>7-tet say).</p><p>Could also develop a scale like that -<br/>the Chopi scale I&apos;ve been trying out<br/>is close to 7-tet but has some purer<br/>fifths than 7-tet.</p><p>The idea of tempering an ET scale to get purer<br/>ratios is pretty standard. I can&apos;t see why<br/>there is any fuss at all about doing it<br/>adaptively when it is already done as<br/>a fixed pitch system.</p><p>I&apos;m sure the only reason that the composers<br/>of Bach&apos;s time didn&apos;t have adaptively<br/>tuned keyboards is because it was impossible<br/>without computers. The various split key<br/>keyboards are the closest one can get to<br/>adaptive tuning without computers.</p><p>I don&apos;t think anyone has done an example to show<br/>how nice adaptively retuned keyboard is to play<br/>with.</p><p>I could do so perhaps. However, my playing with<br/>the adaptively retuned keyboard makes rather embarassing<br/>listening at present even as an amateur performance (the<br/>pure harmonies also really highlight any faults of<br/>intonation), but with the feedback of listening to<br/>the recording and then playing again,<br/>maybe I&apos;ll get one decent enough to listen to.</p><p>Robert</p></div>
