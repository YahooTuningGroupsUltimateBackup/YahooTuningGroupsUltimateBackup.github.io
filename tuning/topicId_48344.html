There are 5 of us.</p><p>&lt;a href=&quot;<a href="http://www.internetsexads.com/landing.asp?afl=TYHO">http://www.internetsexads.com/landing.asp?afl=TYHO</a>&quot;&gt;The Bar Challenge Photos&lt;/a&gt;</p><p>We decided to see which one of us could get laid the most in one month.  There were a few rules and such but the catch was that you had to have proof, thus a photo or video etc... or he had to come forth at the end of the month and admit he had sex with whomever... but since I didnt expect to ever see them again... that would be tough... well we are into 3 weeks and the girls and I thought it would be fun to post the results with the proof.  Some of our photos were quite intersting... Some girls were going after ex-boyfriends, and some of us even decided to find other girls to use strap-ons on us.  Those photos are great...</p><p>Here are the results, so far...&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;   <a href="http://www.internetsexads.com/landing.asp?afl=TYHO">www.internetsexads.com/landing.asp?afl=TYHO</a></p></div>
