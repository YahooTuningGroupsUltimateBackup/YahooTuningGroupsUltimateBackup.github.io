Although not attached to any historical<br/>repertoire, I can imagine JIs without ratios of 3;  La Monte Young gets along<br/>well enough skipping ratios of 5.</p><p>&lt;&lt;              (3) This odd-limit is high enough to provide<br/>                  pure or low-integer ratios for all stable<br/>                  concords in the given musical context.   &gt;&gt;</p><p>Although my main interest has always been the way in which tunings are<br/>articulated in real musical contexts -- as opposed to the invention of scales<br/>in the abstract -- a certain alarm goes up in my head when I read that<br/>compositional criteria are used to decide whether a tuning is X or not-X. In<br/>this case, the presence of &quot;stable concords&quot; being used to determine whether<br/>a tuning is &quot;classical JI&quot; or nor.  For one, the implication here is that JI<br/>is suitable only for tonal music based upon an opposition of consonance and<br/>dissonance. While not &quot;classical&quot; JI, I still like to hear Partch&apos;s music as<br/>being in _a_ JI despite the absence of &quot;stable concords&quot; as a structuring<br/>element in much of his better music.</p><p>This is similar to my postings regarding Ferneyhough&apos;s _String Trio_: there I<br/>had no doubt that the tuning specified was 24tet, my doubt was rather whether<br/>the composer has used the tuning for its unique qualities or arbitrarily as a<br/>collection giving a variegated surface and unparseable vertical sonorites.</p><p>Isn&apos;t it more useful to define the tuning independently of the compositional<br/>technique and then to analyse the way in which individual repertoires,<br/>composers or compositions project (or fail to project) aspects of that tuning?</p></div>
