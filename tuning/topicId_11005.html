It is a very heavy book.</p><p>&gt;  I, for one, am still eagerly awaiting a  finalized, collated and<br/>&gt;  cohesive presentation ?  on your explorations into<br/>&gt;  Ives microtonal intentions. I was not convinced previously, but I ascribed<br/>&gt;  that mostly to the piece-meal manner in which individual statements were<br/>&gt;  parsed. In this case, my jury is still out...</p><p>Dan Stearns?  Could you address this issue, that of piece-mail versus a<br/>complete chapter and/or book?    I suspect the medium is partly at fault.  I<br/>find something new, or not previously discussed outside of the original<br/>medium, and I post it for group contemplation.</p><p>&gt;&gt;Since the contrary material has not been properly presented, I plan to add<br/>&gt;  &gt;any more examples of negative chromelodeon feelings by Partch.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;  This only serves to make your work appear completely biased.</p><p>Every scholar is biased.  I was carefully laying my bias out for all to see.<br/>It&apos;s similar to starting a concert series for non-12TET music because it<br/>wasn&apos;t being properly presented.</p><p>&gt;  the fact is that it<br/>&gt;  has only been in the last 3+ years that the bulk of Partch&apos;s writings, and<br/>&gt;  writings about him, have really been opening up the dualities and<br/>&gt;  complexities of his work and his life. It is not straight-forward, it is<br/>&gt;  not perfect. It is, however, rather fascinating.</p><p>Exactly, this is why Partch writing that he is not happy with the<br/>chromelodeon throughout much of his life is eye opening.</p><p>&gt;  Not to mention that you seem to *want* to read &apos;electronics&apos; into the<br/>&gt;  statements at each turn,</p><p>Not so, I only want to give the Internet readers a chance to read views<br/>contrary to the Corporeal Meadows website.  Encosure 3 is very expensive,<br/>something that Harry Parch could never have afforded to buy in his lifetime,<br/>certainly if it was about a different composer than himself.  (This last<br/>sentence is pure speculation.)</p><p>&gt;  &gt;The more I read &quot;Enclosure 3&quot; by Partch, the more human, and<br/>understandable<br/>&gt;  &gt;Partch the pioneer becomes.  While I myself am an acoustic musician, it<br/>&gt;  &gt;appears that Partch pioneered the concept of electronics, certainly<br/>&gt;  &gt;amplification, for his music.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;  You need to do more reading, because &quot;pioneered the concept of<br/>electronics&quot;<br/>&gt;  is a bit of a stretch. IMHO.</p><p>What would you suggest he is a pioneer of?  Percussion music? Just<br/>Intonation?  An Indie record company?  Why not the concept of electronics?</p><p>&gt;  Complex. Indeed...<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;  Bye kids,<br/>&gt;  Jon</p><p>Please share more with us.  As a result of the your previous postings, I<br/>ceased performances of Partch&apos;s music using electronic means.  Pardon me for<br/>receiving a shock wave when reading that Partch wished for something that is<br/>now possible.</p><p>Gee, Parch&apos;s music really could do better in its travels than waiting for<br/>Dean Drummond.  But that&apos;s just my opinion and I will respect the heirs.  I<br/>have never heard the Kronos Quartet do Barstow, may I turn to stone.</p><p>Johnny Reinhard</p></div><h3><a id=11007 href="#11007">ðŸ”—</a>David Beardsley &#x3C;xouoxno@virtulink.com&#x3E;</h3><span>7/3/2000 3:16:38 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p><a href="mailto:Afmmjr@aol.com">Afmmjr@aol.com</a> wrote:</p><p>&gt; What would you suggest he is a pioneer of?

I think that they flow --<br/>and thereby read -- quite a bit differently than his similar TD posts<br/>and points do.</p><p>So surprisingly enough, Johnny&apos;s &quot;extended Pythagorean Ives&quot; argument<br/>seems a much better fit to me in the integrated context of his &quot;Ives<br/>Universe&quot; (of which it&apos;s probably important to note that the &quot;Acoustic<br/>Plan&quot; actually only comprises a relatively small part) than it ever<br/>did the back and forth context of the TD threads... that this is all<br/>coming from the angle of one who wants -- and believes it right -- to<br/>give some actual intonational reality to these ideas and issues in<br/>Ives no longer seems objectionable to me on the basis of what might be<br/>said to be an exaggeration of the evidence alone... so in short I&apos;d<br/>have to say that Johnny&apos;s &quot;extended Pythagorean Ives&quot; made for a much<br/>better contextual narrative when viewed from someplace other than the<br/>middle of a sometimes passionate TD back and forth.</p><p>Just some thoughts as they came to mind.</p><p>Dan</p></div>
