He then had a major scale using the first 5 harmonics.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Joe, you lost me there.  Where did he have this scale?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Also, I must be missing something fundamental here, but how<br/>playable<br/>&gt; is that?  There&apos;s only the 6 open strings, and their octaves, that<br/>&gt; belong to a just pentatonic with the lowest-term ratios<br/>&gt;  8/3 * (3/8 3/6 5/8 4/6 6/8 5/6)<br/>&gt; or<br/>&gt;  1/1 4/3 5/3 16/9 2/1 20/9<br/>&gt; or<br/>&gt;  1/9 * (9 12 15 16 18 20).<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Playing all of these and their octaves gives the scale E A C# D E<br/>F#<br/>&gt; A C# D E F# - a nice pentatonic segment of the just A major scale,<br/>&gt; missing the second and seventh.  The only useful harmonies there<br/>seem<br/>&gt; to be I and IV; not even a V or ii, let alone a V7.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; So stepping outside the just ratios, and playing all of the other<br/>&gt; frets, gives a gamut comprising a set of justly-related tones and<br/>the<br/>&gt; 12-EDO semitones scales built on them.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Finally, does this help answer the question of creating micrtonal<br/>&gt; scales on the standard guitar?  The difference between the just<br/>&gt; fourth 4/3 = 498 cents and the equal-tempered fourth 5 frets above<br/>&gt; the low E = 500 cents is just 2 cents, surely at the limit of<br/>&gt; usability for a micrtonal scale (few members of this list are sure<br/>&gt; they even hear it in music at moderate to fast tempos).  Still,<br/>that<br/>&gt; could be just the kind of difference Murray was after.  Other<br/>steps<br/>&gt; do provide better contrast, eg the equal tempered major third at<br/>400<br/>&gt; cents above the A, with the just major third C#; but I can&apos;t see<br/>the<br/>&gt; rationale for using this tuning for constructing a microtonal<br/>scale.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Worse, when I try to play with the guitar tuned like this, nothing<br/>&gt; really works for me, either melodically or harmonically.  That may<br/>&gt; not be saying very much, cos I&apos;m sure not a crash-hot guitar<br/>player,<br/>&gt; but most of my licks sound out of tune on the higher strings, and<br/>&gt; also sound weak (I think that may be because their compass is so<br/>&gt; squashed together that the lower strings don&apos;t provide much<br/>resonance<br/>&gt; for them).<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; --- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;dj_spleenbaby&quot; wrote:<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; hi all,<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; i&apos;m new here and after a quick delve into the archives<br/>couldn&apos;t<br/>&gt; find what i was after so apologies if it&apos;s already there and i&apos;m<br/>just<br/>&gt; rubbish in my research.<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; i was wondering what possibilities were available for playing<br/>&gt; microtonal music on a &apos;standard&apos; gtr (not one with extra or<br/>different<br/>&gt; fret positions) without the use of a slide or similar implement.<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; more specifically i&apos;ve been playing around with alternative<br/>&gt; tunings and stringings (glenn branca and sonic youth would be good<br/>&gt; indicators of the techniques i&apos;ve been trying so far) and<br/>&gt; particularly using identically tuned strings which create a droney<br/>&gt; sound and have minor tuning differences due to accuracy in tuning<br/>and<br/>&gt; different string gauge etc.<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; i&apos;ve mainly been playing with these techniques intuitively,<br/>just<br/>&gt; finding combinations i like the sounds of, and wondered what<br/>&gt; resources were available to help me develop a deeper understanding<br/>of<br/>&gt; what i&apos;m doing.<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; i&apos;m interested in microtonal music so resources that used<br/>&gt; stringing and/or tuning to open up these possibilities rather than<br/>&gt; carpentry skills would be much appreciated.<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; thanks for your time.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Murray,<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; One fairly obvious extension of your idea of tuning pairs of<br/>strings<br/>&gt; in unison is to tune them some fraction of a semitone apart.  Eg,<br/>if<br/>&gt; the fraction is 1/2, you have quartertones, and any scale you can<br/>&gt; build by selecting several of the 24 quartertones per octave.<br/>&gt; Similarly, if the fraction is 1/3, you have sixth-tones, giving up<br/>to<br/>&gt; 24 notes per octave - or 36 if you tuned the top three strings<br/>just a<br/>&gt; sixth-tone apart.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; But a lot depends on what you&apos;re after.  You mentioned Sonic<br/>Youth,<br/>&gt; and the effects of slight mistunings, which I think is more about<br/>&gt; sound quality than about the scale resources of microtones.

We went down that route several months - maybe a year? - ago.<br/>At first I thought I had a different EDO, but a prod from someone -<br/>either Paul Erlich or Gene Ward Smith, I think - soon woke me up.<br/>It&apos;s definitely neither a just tuning nor an EDO; it&apos;s not an EDL<br/>(equal division of length) either.  The maths is not rocket science,<br/>but it&apos;s also rather boring, compared with the novelty of the<br/>_sounds_ the tuning makes.  (If you want to delve into the maths, we<br/>could take it to tuning-math.)</p><p>Tuned normally, the guitar has the bridge at twice the 12th fret<br/>length.  From memory, I found putting the new bridge at twice the<br/>9th, 10th and 11th fret positions the most practical, and using twice<br/>the 10th fret length for the string produced the most pleasing<br/>scale.  I intended to make time to play around with it some more;<br/>also putting the octave (halfway point on the string) exactly halfway<br/>between successive frets.</p><p>So this is certainly another way that Murray can get a microtonal<br/>tuning from an ordinary guitar with minimum equipment and<br/>engineering.
