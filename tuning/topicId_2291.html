I wouldn&apos;t be at all surprised to<br/>learn, for example, that medieval bagpipes were often tuned with what<br/>would now be called neutral thirds (~11:9), and it would take a lot of<br/>Pythagorean notes per octave to approximate such an interval.<br/>Similarly, theorists such as Theinred of Dover (13th c.?), Anonymous<br/>IV (c. 1275), and Walter Odington (c. 1300) suggest that certain<br/>dialects of English music featured a more pervasive use of thirds than<br/>in most Western European styles of the time, and that performers may<br/>have tended to tune such thirds as approximating 5:4 and 6:5.</p><p>However, the question remains: does it follow that because Pythagorean<br/>was evidently not _universal_ in Gothic practice for all regions of<br/>Western Europe and styles of music, that therefore it has little<br/>practical importance? Please let me emphasize that I do not ascribe to<br/>you this position, but sense that it could be widespread.</p><p>By the same token, we could argue that meantone tuning is really of<br/>little practical importance to Renaissance practice, because as early<br/>as the 14th century there is an account of tuning some intervals on a<br/>pipe organ in septimal ratios, and a normal minor seventh in 1/4-comma<br/>meantone is nowhere near 7:4.</p><p>A rebuttal might be that while 7:4 is a fine tuning for many purposes,<br/>it is not necessarily the best for a minor seventh in a 16th-century<br/>setting where this interval is generally regarded as an unequivocal<br/>dissonance, and the typical meantone tuning not too far from 9:5 may<br/>better fit its role.</p><p>Similarly, as Mark Lindley has eloquently argued, a major third around<br/>81:64 and a major sixth around 27:16 very nicely fit the needs of<br/>Gothic music, where these intervals are typically points of<br/>instability inviting resolution to stable concords.</p><p>One interesting statement on the practicality of Pythagorean tuning<br/>for medieval polyphony was made by Easley Blackwood in his study on<br/>recognizable diatonic tunings, in which he shows the contradictions<br/>that would result from attempting to sing a passage from Machaut&apos;s<br/>Mass in 5-limit just intonation, and concludes that Pythagorean<br/>(3-limit JI) is the best choice.</p><p>These observations tie in with a more general point: tuning _all_<br/>intervals as concordantly as possible is not necessarily the objective<br/>of just intonations, Pythagorean or otherwise.</p><p>Most respectfully,</p><p>Margo Schulter<br/><a href="mailto:mschulter@value.net">mschulter@value.net</a></p></div>
