When I get to it I will post my scala formatted file of his<br/>&gt; temperament as well.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Now I&apos;m off to spend time with my daughter,<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Chris<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; <a href="http://micro.soonlabel.com/blue-tuning/blue-ji-excluded-by-peers.mp3">http://micro.soonlabel.com/blue-tuning/blue-ji-excluded-by-peers.mp3</a><br/>&gt; &gt; I think this is a beautiful impro, Chris. Sounds like you were inspired by the purity of the JI chords when you played&nbsp;these&nbsp;harmonies.<br/>&gt; &gt; Nevertheless I feel a dissonance between 55&quot; and 1&apos;05&quot;, could it be something like a 40/27 in that passage ?<br/>&gt; &gt; (Kraig&apos;s lattice shows two of them in the&nbsp;scale, and also one fifth of the wolf).<br/>&gt; &gt; Also did you used at all the 15/14 and 7/5 of the scale, that close the fifth cycle ? I am be curious to hear how these two 7-L &nbsp;notes sound with the rest.<br/>&gt; &gt; - - - - - - -<br/>&gt; &gt; Jacques</p></div>
