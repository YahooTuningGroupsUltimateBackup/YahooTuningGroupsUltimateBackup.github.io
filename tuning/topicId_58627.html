The properties of a scale applies regardless of size of the intervals.<br/>Moments of Symetry though usually are not found in just intonation scales because you have many different size intervals. It close relative, constant structures, do apply.<br/>The original papers in the authors handwriting can be found here<br/><a href="http://www.anaphoria.com/mos.PDF">http://www.anaphoria.com/mos.PDF</a></p><p>Of couse all of these are just theoretical constructs, and what makes a scale is determined by ones ear. So there are things that lie outside of all the above.<br/>On the other hand, I do not know of any of the above being heard not as a scale. At least not anyone who has spoken up.</p><p>&gt;<br/>&gt;Message: 2         &gt;   Date: Fri, 20 May 2005 08:27:45 -0000<br/>&gt;   From: &quot;ahoningh2000&quot; &lt;<a href="mailto:ahoningh@science.uva.nl">ahoningh@science.uva.nl</a>&gt;<br/>&gt;Subject: question about just intonation scales<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;Dear all,<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;I was wondering what makes a sequence of notes a (just intonation)<br/>&gt;scale. Maybe somebody can tell me about properties of just intonation<br/>&gt;scales, like conditions they have to satisfy? &gt;In the Encyclopaedia of Tuning I did find some properties of scales.<br/>&gt;Under &apos;scale&apos; is written: &quot;Scales often, but not always, exhibit<br/>&gt;tetrachordal similarity, and other properties such as MOS, propriety,<br/>&gt;distributional evenness, etc.&quot;<br/>&gt;However, all these properties are only valid for equal tempered scales<br/>&gt;(or am I wrong?). &gt;Are there similar properties for just intonation scales? I hope<br/>&gt;somebody can help me. Thanks in advance.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;Best regards,<br/>&gt;Aline Honingh<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;  &gt;</p><p>--<br/>Kraig Grady<br/>North American Embassy of Anaphoria Island &lt;<a href="http://anaphoria.com/">http://anaphoria.com/</a>&gt;<br/>The Wandering Medicine Show<br/>KXLU &lt;<a href="http://www.kxlu.com/main.html">http://www.kxlu.com/main.html</a>&gt; 88.9 FM Wed 8-9 pm Los Angeles</p></div><h3>Afmmjr@aol.com</h3><span>5/20/2005 8:33:04 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Kraig makes good points, as did Yaya.  Maybe I see it a bit differently, from<br/>a different perspective.</p><p>If a scale is a mere ordering of notes from low to high from which we extract<br/>tones to compose, then yes, there can be such a thing as a just intonation<br/>scale.</p><p>But really, scale seems more of a metaphor when applied to just intonation.<br/>First off, it is anathema to melody, as Kraig pointed out.  For in just<br/>intonation, when all notes are perfectly tapped from the overtone series, a<br/>stupendous blend of harmony ensues.  This is not the stuff of a melodic scale.</p><p>A second reason to avoid a term like &quot;scale&quot; or &quot;mode&quot; in favor of &quot;limit&quot; is<br/>that just intonation is a fabric of intervalic relationships, as noted by<br/>Harry Partch.  It&apos;s a musical chain reaction of numbers.  Choices are the human<br/>contribution to the majesty of definitive consonance, timbre made livid, that<br/>which we call just intonation harmonies.</p><p>Limits seem the best fit for describing just intonation choices:</p><p>3-limit    pythagorean tuning (cycle of fifths)<br/>5-limit    modern tuning, although tempered<br/>7-limit    Terry Riley, Johann Philipp Kirnberger, ancient Greek<br/>11-limit    Harry Partch...others would explain 11-limit as the rationale for<br/>quartertones<br/>13-limit    Jon Catler...extended ji of Ben Johnston</p><p>all best, Johnny Reinhard</p></div>
