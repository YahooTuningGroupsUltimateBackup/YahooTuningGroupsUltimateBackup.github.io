Wier&quot;<br/>Subject: Re: RE: My dream harmonica</p><p>From: &quot;Yahya Abdal-Aziz&quot;:</p><p>&gt; Since the harmonica uses vibrating metal reeds, and the pitch of<br/>&gt; each depends mostly on its length, would it be hard to modify a<br/>&gt; standard instrument by cutting and filing off the ends of some<br/>&gt; reeds?</p><p>Yeah, but that would raise the pitch of the reeds; I&apos;m wanting to lower the<br/>pitch of some, and redistribute them as well. (A conventional harmonica<br/>repeats the octave every four holes; mine every three.)</p><p>This website looks promising: <a href="http://www.customharmonicas.com/">http://www.customharmonicas.com/</a>. They do<br/>experimental instruments; possibly including microtonal. Except they don&apos;t<br/>show any pictures of instruments or anything.</p><p>________________________________________________________________________</p><p>--<br/>No virus found in this outgoing message.<br/>Checked by AVG Anti-Virus.<br/>Version: 7.0.308 / Virus Database: 266.7.2 - Release Date: 11/3/05</p></div>
