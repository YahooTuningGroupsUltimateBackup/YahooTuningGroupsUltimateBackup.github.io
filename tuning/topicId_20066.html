I find his role on this tuning forum<br/>does not in any way resembles Paul. Dan has always been careful to not transgress into others<br/>natural inclination for the purpose of filibustering his own solutions. He remains informed by<br/>various assumptions as opposed to being possessed by them.<br/>  ------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p>   In regard to the other<br/>    A brilliant mathematical mind without question. But the essence of music has shown how<br/>merciless it can be against mathematics that is blind to its true mysteries. She proves time again<br/>that she is not his servant.<br/>    The results of his harmonic entropy/harmonic block variations on scales, especially my own<br/>which are one I can compare, without insight in its number crunching, but which is at least<br/>uniformed by an ear.<br/>22 ET.
