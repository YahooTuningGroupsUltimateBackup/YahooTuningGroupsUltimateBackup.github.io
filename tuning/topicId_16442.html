I once raised this on the Finale<br/>list,<br/>and a couple of people there seemed to think my answer was correct - but I<br/>thought it would be fun to see what anyone on this list thinks.  (If anyone<br/>here<br/>is also on the Finale list, I apologize to you because I&apos;m about to subject<br/>you<br/>to this again - but it was a year ago, after all, and it will mostly be new<br/>people who read it now.)<br/>     It&apos;s a permutational question concerning the number of possible scales<br/>you<br/>can invent in the equal-tempered 12-note octave.  Perhaps it can also be<br/>expressed in terms of set theory (not by me, though).  I must emphasize that<br/>I<br/>am *not* talking about Pythagorean tuning for this question, but a closed<br/>system<br/>of just 12 different pitches in equal temperament, plus all their octave<br/>transpositions.<br/>     I have to define my terms exactly; especially, I have to define<br/>precisely<br/>what I mean by a scale.<br/>     If you start with the 12 chromatic notes of the equal-tempered octave,<br/>you<br/>invent a scale by selecting any number of these notes from 1 to 12 notes,<br/>and<br/>arrange them in order of pitch.  The pitches and intervals are considered<br/>circular, so that, for the C-major scale, for instance, you don&apos;t get a new<br/>scale just by starting on another note, as in the old church modes.  By my<br/>definition, these are 7 different modes; but it&apos;s all the same scale.  More<br/>generally, I would define a mode as any scale structure considered as<br/>beginning<br/>with one particular note and one particular interval.  So my definition of<br/>the<br/>diatonic scale, for instance would simply be the sequence of 5 whole-tones<br/>and<br/>two semitones, considered to wrap around in a circle, with the semitones<br/>being<br/>separated by two whole-tones in their closest separation - and this says<br/>nothing<br/>about whether any particular note or interval is considered the start of the<br/>scale.<br/>     Also, if you have a similar scale structure in B major or Ab major or<br/>whatever, I am counting this as the same scale: in other words,<br/>transpostions<br/>don&apos;t count.  I am solely concerned with distinct circular sequences of<br/>intervals which make up one octave, with no distinction about which interval<br/>you<br/>start with (which mode of the scale you are considering), and with no<br/>concern<br/>about what pitch you cast the entire structure in (the key it&apos;s in).  In<br/>analyzing problems relating to this, it is easier to focus on the intervals<br/>between the notes rather than the notes themselves.<br/>     (My definition might be a bit wordy; but it&apos;s very important to the<br/>problem<br/>to be absolutely clear on what makes scales different by this definition,<br/>and<br/>what doesn&apos;t.)</p><p>     The number of possible scales, as just defined, is far less than I<br/>originally would have expected.  Before considering the problem, I might<br/>have<br/>naively expected thousands, if not millions, of scales, considering all the<br/>possible permutations of notes and intervals you can arrive at.  But I am<br/>now<br/>fairly sure that there are only 351 scales.  It&apos;s amazing how many<br/>permutations<br/>are ruled out because they are simply different modes of the same scale,<br/>and/or<br/>different transpositions.<br/>     I found out the number of scales by the brute-force method of listing<br/>all<br/>possible scales, expressing them by circles of numbers representing the size<br/>of<br/>intervals counted in semitones: first listing all 1-, 12-, and 11-note<br/>scales<br/>(only one of each), then 2- and 10-notes scales (only 6 of each), and so on.<br/>Then I simply counted them, and it came to 351 scales.<br/>     (It&apos;s easiest to list each scale on paper as a row of numbers beginning<br/>with the largest interval in each, but regarding the line as circular; the<br/>horizontal arrangement and the beginning with the largest interval have no<br/>permutational significance, but just make it easier to see if you&apos;ve missed<br/>or<br/>duplicated any permutations.  Notionally you regard each sequence of numbers<br/>as<br/>a circle of numbers - that&apos;s vital to the problem I&apos;m posing.)<br/>     Here are the numbers of scales I found with each number of notes:</p><p>     No. notes  No. of<br/>     in scale   scales</p><p>        12          1<br/>     1, 11      1,  1<br/>     2, 10      6,  6<br/>     3,  9     19, 19<br/>     4,  8     43, 43<br/>     5,  7     66, 66<br/>         6         80</p><p>     TOTAL        351</p><p>     (I debated whether to include a scale of 0 notes in it, but rejected<br/>this<br/>as having no musical meaning.  (I suppose John Cage&apos;s 4&apos; 33&quot; is the only<br/>piece<br/>written in a 0-note scale. :-) )  But certain analysis I have done with the<br/>properties of various scales, regarding them purely as mathematical<br/>entities,<br/>only makes sense and retains perfect symmetry of structure if you do accept<br/>a<br/>notional 0-note scale.  This stems from the fact that scales form<br/>complementary<br/>pairs such that, when you select notes for a scale, the notes left in the<br/>chromatic scale you *didn&apos;t* select form another scale complementary to the<br/>first, so that every 5-note scale can be paired uniquely with a particular<br/>7-note scale, every 4-note scale with a particular 8-note scale, and so on.<br/>6-note scales are either their own complement (at a different pitch of<br/>course,<br/>such as the whole-tone scale), or pair up with another 6-note scale.  The<br/>justification for allowing a 0-note scale is that it is the only possible<br/>complement for the 12-note scale (whose existence surely no-one would deny).<br/>Seen in set-theory terms, I suppose the 12-note scale would be the universal<br/>set, and the 0-note scale the empty set.  But I have not included the 0-note<br/>scale in the table of figures above.)<br/>     I catalogued the 351 scales on paper several times separated by some<br/>interval of time, and arrived at the same result each time, and this<br/>convinces<br/>me it is the correct answer.  Any mistakes I might make which cause that<br/>number<br/>to vary would be unlikely to be repeated on different occasions so as to<br/>make<br/>the number of scales arrived at inaccurate by exactly the same amount each<br/>time;<br/>in other words, if I made mistakes at all, I would almost certainly make<br/>them<br/>*differently* each time I did the exercise.<br/>     That&apos;s why I think 351 is in fact the correct number; but the fact<br/>remains<br/>that I cannot prove mathematically that it is the correct answer.<br/>     Can anyone prove it (and explain it in terms I can understand)?</p><p>     There is the question of how many modes there are of these scales.  Now<br/>we<br/>*do* take into account starting-points (but not transpositions to different<br/>keys).  Most scales will have the same number of modes as they have notes,<br/>because each note chosen as a starting point will give a different pattern<br/>of<br/>intervals relative to that starting note (even though they are all the same<br/>considered as a circular pattern).  But some scales will have fewer modes.<br/>For<br/>instance, the scales C D# E G Ab B C and C Db D# E F# G A Bb C have only two<br/>modes each, because some of the modes duplicate each others&apos; interval<br/>patterns.<br/>(Enharmonic differences in spelling are ignored, and can&apos;t be avoided no<br/>matter<br/>how you arrange things.)  The first of these two scales has the two modes<br/>3 1 3 1 3 1 and 1 3 1 3 1 3 (with the numbers expressing successive<br/>intervals<br/>counted in semitones); the second scale&apos;s two modes are 1 2 1 2 1 2 1 2 and<br/>2 1 2 1 2 1 2 1.  The scale C Db E F# G Bb C (the &quot;Petrushka&quot; scale) has *3*<br/>different modes (1 3 2 1 3 2, 3 2 1 3 2 1, and 2 1 3 2 1 3); the whole-tone<br/>scale has only *1* mode (2 2 2 2 2 2), because, whatever note you start on,<br/>the<br/>intervals are always identical.<br/>     It would be easy in principle, if time-consuming, to just calculate all<br/>modes of all scales (1*1 + 6*2 + 19*3, etc.), then eliminate the ones that<br/>duplicate their interval patterns.  I estimate that the number would be in<br/>the<br/>region of 1,700 or thereabouts.  But is there a neat mathematical way of<br/>working<br/>out the number of modes from a consideration of the earlier problem about<br/>the<br/>number of scales (viewing it as a permutational problem)?  If so, it is way<br/>beyond my mathematical ability.</p><p>     I&apos;ve established that there are exactly 16 periodic scales.  I define a<br/>periodic scale as one which divides into two or more equal portions of<br/>identical<br/>intervallic make-up.  (For instance, the three scales I cited above; the<br/>whole-tone scale; the chromatic scale.)  Another way of expressing this is<br/>scales with fewer distinct modes than notes per octave.  Messiaen&apos;s<br/>so-called<br/>&quot;modes&quot; (which I think should be called scales) of limited transposition are<br/>7<br/>of these periodic scales; but his list of 7 omits a few interesting scales,<br/>as<br/>well as trivially simple examples (2-, 3-, or 4-note scales, of limited<br/>practical use but nonetheless undeniably still being periodic scales as I<br/>defined them).<br/>     (I think such scales of the sort I am now talking about are more<br/>commonly<br/>termed &quot;symmetrical scales&quot;; but I abandoned this term when I noticed that<br/>there<br/>were two different ways can be symmetrical, and thus the term is ambiguous.<br/>I<br/>now refer to periodic scales and self-reflective scales for the two types.)<br/>     I&apos;ve examined the properties of these periodic scales in considerable<br/>detail, because they kind of fascinate me, and have done so for many years;<br/>and<br/>I can state definitely that the number of these periodic scales breaks down<br/>thus:</p><p>     No. notes  No. of<br/>     in scale   scales</p><p>        12          1<br/>     1, 11      0,  0<br/>     2, 10      1,  1<br/>     3,  9      1,  1<br/>     4,  8      3,  3<br/>     5,  7      0,  0<br/>         6          5</p><p>     TOTAL         16</p><p>     I have seen some of these scales in actual scores, if only briefly in<br/>most<br/>cases - but not all of them.</p><p>     Has anyone systematically studied the properties and relationships of<br/>scales and modes?  A musician I have corresponded with in England told me<br/>that<br/>the English composer John Foulds had done some analysis along these lines,<br/>and<br/>he sent me a photocopy of a list of several dozen scales than Foulds had<br/>apparently arranged in some way.  But the information I was given was<br/>tantalizingly too little for me to infer what Foulds was doing, or how he<br/>was<br/>classifying the scales.<br/>     I wonder if anyone knows more about this, or knows of anyone else who<br/>has<br/>studied scale patterns in depth.  (I once saw a thick book of hundreds of<br/>scales<br/>compiled by Nicholas Slonimsky; however, to me it looked comprehensive, but<br/>not<br/>all that systematic.)</p><p>                         Michael Edwards.</p><p>MusicTheory onelist.</p></div><h3>Steven Kallstrom &#x3C;skallstr@sun.iwu.edu&#x3E;</h3><span>12/11/2000 4:09:21 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>This posting is in response to Michael Edwards posting which is quite long,<br/>so I will not include the original hear...</p><p>To determine the number of possible scales under Mr. Edwards criteria, we<br/>are doing basic number theory... this topic has been extensively covered in<br/>music theory literature...</p><p>Allen Forte: The Structure of Atonal Music<br/>Robert D.

The total number of possible sets in 12tet is 12^2 or 4096,<br/>this includes the full chromatic scale and the null set...  within that 4096<br/>many of these sets will be transpositionally equivalent, for instance<br/>C-Major = D-Major and so on...  after we take out transpositional<br/>equivalence there are 352 (including sets with 0 elements)...  set theory<br/>further reduces this number through inversional equivalence...  for instance<br/>{C-E-G} and {A-C-E} are both considered the same set they are related<br/>through inversion (basically reading the intervals backwards)  C-E-G is a<br/>M3rd + m3rd  A-C-E is a m3 + M3.  After subtracting inversionally equivalent<br/>sets there are only 158 unique sets in 12tet (including sets with 0<br/>elements)...</p><p>&#x9;So, it seems that you are correct Mr. Edwards that there are only 351<br/>scales (not counting the 0 element set).  I am rather impressed that you did<br/>this all by hand...  Allen Forte used computers to compile his set tables,<br/>but you did everything by hand and got everything right...</p><p>&#x9;Your approach towards the possible number of scales is different than most<br/>set theoretic literature since you don&apos;t consider sets related by inversion<br/>as equal...  for instance if you look at the intervals of the harmonic minor<br/>scale are as follows</p><p>C, D, E-flat, F, G, A-flat, B, C   (2,1,2,2,1,3,1)</p><p>inverted you get this...</p><p>C, D-flat, E, F, G, A, B-flat, C   (1,3,1,2,2,1,2)</p><p>these are obviously two different musical creatures...  atonal set-theory<br/>doesn&apos;t distinguish  between these since there interval content is the<br/>same...  but the principles of set-theory are very valuable for looking at<br/>how musical sets will interact... you can analyze different set in many<br/>different ways... one valuable way is to look at the common notes between<br/>two different musical sets and determine ways to modulate between sets...<br/>for instance... not only can you look at the similarities between different<br/>sets, but the similarities between different transpositions of the same<br/>set...  for instance C-Major and G-Major have 6 notes in common...  C Major<br/>and F Whole-tone have four notes in common...  you can generalize conepts of<br/>modulation from these ideas...  also, if you look at the make up of a set...<br/>for instance the Major Scale has 12 different forms, and a given scale<br/>contains a single tritone and three  major triads... simply by knowing this<br/>you know that there is one other scalar form that contains that tri-tone and<br/>that a single major triad will be found in 3 other scales...  e.g.  the B-F<br/>tri-tone is found in C-Major and F#-Major...  the C-Major Triad is found in<br/>C, F, G major...  this is also a very powerful compositional tool concerning<br/>harmonic ambiguity in abstract sets and again in modulation.</p><p>&#x9;A book that is very valuable, even though it considers only the 158 sets<br/>with inversional equivalence is Jeffrey Johnson&apos;s Thesaurus of Abstract<br/>Musical Properties... unfortunately it is a very expensive book...</p><p>&#x9;I am basically writing a small text book concerning &apos;scale theory&apos; and set<br/>theory for an independent study in Music Theory...  if there are any more<br/>questions or if clarifications are desired feel free to ask...</p><p>Steven Kallstrom<br/>Illinois Wesleyan University<br/>Senior Composition/Theory Major<br/>Harpsichordist<br/><a href="mailto:skallstr@sun.iwu.edu">skallstr@sun.iwu.edu</a></p></div><h3>monxmood@free.fr</h3><span>12/11/2000 12:28:04 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>&gt; ** Original Subject: RE: [tuning] FW: [MusicTheory] 351 possible scales? - but I can&apos;t prove it.<br/>&gt; ** Original Sender: &quot;Paul H.
