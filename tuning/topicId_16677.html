I&apos;m sure that for<br/>one&apos;s acclimated to playing with standard tuned instruments, the new<br/>melodic possibilities are astounding and fresh.</p><p>I&apos;m trying to keep track of all posts on this thread, I wish that we<br/>could keep a common related subject line, so that it will be easy for<br/>others to search for this topic in out database. Especially for being<br/>able to later access this info about the open tuning ideas.</p><p>Reading with interest (and doing top secret research in the<br/>background),</p><p>Jacky Ligon</p><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@egroups.com">tuning@egroups.com</a>, Seth Austen &lt;acoustic@l...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Interesting point. I wonder whether all fourths, similar to the oud<br/>or<br/>&gt; cumbus (all fourths and one second), or all fifths would be more<br/>suited to<br/>&gt; JI guitar. Many of the open tunings I use are combinations of<br/>fourths and<br/>&gt; fifths with a second somewhere in the middle.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Seth</p></div>
