I recommend listening.<br/>Have some time on your hands - there are a lot of them.</p><p>The great Etta James file is the subject of this posting.<br/>Or the vehicle, anyway.</p><p>Go download it now, before it goes the way of Zappa,<br/>listen to it,<br/>and then come back to me.</p><p>------------------------------------------</p><p>This is the one I promised earlier, where I explore<br/>triangular and other, cross-exponent, prime-lattice connections.</p><p>I have been interested for some time in determining<br/>some &apos;typical&apos; rational and &gt;12-ET representations<br/>of the &apos;bent&apos; notes one hears in good blues vocal<br/>and guitar work.</p><p>This has been an interest ever since first learning<br/>about JI thru reading Partch&apos;s _Genesis_,<br/>because I&apos;ve always loved the blues and used to have<br/>a hard time capturing the &apos;blues feel&apos; with my<br/>trained-musician chops.</p><p>I found out later,<br/>it was because I never learned about microtones in school.  :(</p><p>Then a few years ago<br/>I happened upon some articles Ezra Sims wrote<br/>analyzing the microtones in an old Louis Armstrong recording<br/>of &apos;St James Infirmary&apos;.</p><p>I analyzed it myself, and found a few notes<br/>that I thought were a tuned a bit differently<br/>than what Sims had said.<br/>This got me even more interested.</p><p>Most of you on this list know about the analysis I did<br/>last year of a Robert Johnson vocal, at:<br/><a href="http://www.ixpres.com/interval/monzo/drunken.htm">http://www.ixpres.com/interval/monzo/drunken.htm</a></p><p>Recently, particularly in discussion with Paul Erlich<br/>and others regarding the &apos;musical complexity&apos; and<br/>&apos;lattice metric&apos; measurements, I&apos;ve been talking about<br/>notes which exhibit quasi-harmonic relationships to a local 1/1<br/>but which are not actual harmonics.</p><p>I had also mentioned Partch&apos;s idea of a monophonic system,<br/>where these kinds of &apos;cross-exponent&apos; lattice metrics hold<br/>(at least within the Partch &apos;diamond&apos;).<br/>These are pitch relationships I have discovered to be in use<br/>in some, perhaps most, pop and blues styles.</p><p>---------------------------------------------</p><p>Whether or not this MIDI file is an accurate reflection<br/>of Ms. James&apos;s recorded performances, the microtonal<br/>inflections in the &apos;vocal&apos; part sound very convincing<br/>to me as being typical of this blues idiom.</p><p>I was intrigued to see what ratios were being implied<br/>by the &apos;3rd&apos;s and &apos;6th&apos;s which were the notes having<br/>some microtonal pitch-bend on them.</p><p>Apparently the creators of this file<br/>(Bobby Keyes and Gale Bass of Rimfire)<br/>recorded the parts live by playing on synths,<br/>- my guess is that they were wind controllers.<br/>At least that&apos;s what it sounds and looks like to me<br/>from the non-quantized start-times<br/>and the curve of the pitch-bend graphs.</p><p>So here at last, I had some mathematical underpinning<br/>to go on, when trying to ascertain rational implications<br/>(as opposed to having only my ears to analyze CD tracks).</p><p>The theoretical resolution of sequencer pitch-bend<br/>is far finer than any pitch discrimination<br/>discernible by human hearing,<br/>or for that matter, possible on most MIDI equipment.<br/>It leaves open a bandwith of interpretation,<br/>rational or otherwise, for the naming or notation of the note.</p><p>I wanted to have the exact pitches someone else recorded,<br/>with an accuracy that would allow me to find<br/>several different allowable numerical interpretations<br/>of characteristic blues vocal gestures.</p><p>I&apos;ve been waiting for a chance to do an analysis like this<br/>with a really good actual musical example,<br/>as opposed to an experiment-type situation.</p><p>I found a few surprising things.</p><p>I examined all the ratios having numbers under 100<br/>within a cents range of about +/- 10 to 20 cents of<br/>each pitch-bent note.  In some cases I noted ratios<br/>with much higher numbers.</p><p>In all cases, my goal was to find<br/>the least complex rationalization possible<br/>within a few cents (i.e., an &apos;inaudible difference&apos;)<br/>of the given pitch-bend.</p><p>By &apos;least complex rationalization&apos;,<br/>I mean reduction into factors, according to my theories:<br/>the best accomodation of both<br/>the lowest prime-base and the lowest exponent<br/>for a given musical aesthetic effect.<br/>I also gave consideration to odd- or integer- factors<br/>where it seemed reasonable to include.</p><p>The rationalization is based on the idea that the<br/>ratios are being perceived as harmonics above the bass note.<br/>(This may not necessarily be 100% valid,<br/>- especially considering that the notes under consideration<br/>are appearing in mainly a melodic,<br/>and only secondarily a harmonic, context -<br/>but regardless, it is the method I used here.)</p><p>So the 1:1 of each lattice diagram is the bass note of the chord.</p><p>I also give the nearest 72-Eq degree,<br/>as I think this is a decent practical notation for microtones.</p><p>Also, because of the numerous even subdivisions of this scale,<br/>quite a few notes crop up which are found in these smaller subsets<br/>(18-, 24-, and 36-Eq).</p><p>There are several cases in this track<br/>(and the entire &apos;sax&apos; solo)<br/>where pitch-bend is used only<br/>to raise the pitch by a 12-Eq semitone or tone,<br/>but there are 3 instances (in the &apos;flute&apos; part)<br/>which have microtonal &apos;targets&apos;.</p><p>I will examine here in excruciating detail<br/>these 3 particular uses of pitch-bend,<br/>one from measure 7, one from measure 16, and one from<br/>measure 18 in the &apos;flute&apos; lead vocal track.</p><p>------------------------------------------------<br/>Introductory: assumptions, structure, notations<br/>------------------------------------------------</p><p>All ratios here are notated assuming &apos;octave&apos;-equivalence,<br/>and ignoring the &apos;octave&apos; placement of the notes.</p><p>The key of the piece is F# major,<br/>so the overall &apos;root&apos; is F# n^0 [= 1/1].</p><p>The chord progression of the basic part of the tune<br/>is I - VI - II - V, the roots and bass line of which are:</p><p>F# n^0 maj - D# 2^(9/12) min - G# 2^(2/12) min - C# 2^(7/12) dom7</p><p>After an intro, the vocal line starts at measure 5.<br/>I am examining here only the &apos;flute melody&apos; track<br/>and only the first part (&apos;A section&apos;) of the tune.</p><p>The basic structure of the tune is thus,<br/>(measure numbers in Arabic numerals and bass line in Roman):</p><p>5     6    7    8     9    10    11   12<br/>I VI II V  I VI II V  I VI II V  I VI II V</p><p>13   14    15   16    17   18    19   20<br/>I VI II V  I VI II V  I VI II V  I IV I  I  &gt;&gt; to the &apos;bridge&apos; ...</p><p>The precise timing is expressed as Measure.Beat.Tick,<br/>with 480 Ticks or pulses per quarter-note (ppq).</p><p>A pitch-bend amount of 4096 units per 12-eq semitone<br/>is assumed.</p><p>I use an adaptation of Ezra Sims&apos;s 72-eq notation,<br/>to illustrate the pitches in my explanations with<br/>letter-names which come within ~8.3 cents of any ratio.</p><p>This notation uses, in addition to letter-names,<br/>the following accidentals:</p><p>&#x9;#  and  b  for semitones (as in usual 12-Eq),<br/>&#x9;^  and  v  for quarter-tones,<br/>&#x9;&gt;
