If you can get used to 10:13:15 triads, there might be some even<br/>trippier possibilities. Tempering out 91/90 is a good choice as well,<br/>as it makes it so that the inversion of 10:13:15 is 6:7:9. May not be<br/>too compatible with 676/675 though, as it necessarily means that 49/48<br/>vanishes...</p><p>-Mike</p></div><h3><a id=97786 href="#97786">ðŸ”—</a>genewardsmith &#x3C;genewardsmith@...&#x3E;</h3><span>4/10/2011 10:09:36 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, Petr Pa&angst;Â™&Atilde;&shy;zek &lt;petrparizek2000@...&gt; wrote:<br/><a href="http://groups.yahoo.com/group/tuning/files/PetrParizek/pp_pump_675.mp3">http://groups.yahoo.com/group/tuning/files/PetrParizek/pp_pump_675.mp3</a></p><p>Interesting!

Don&apos;t buy it.  In all these songs, they do treat a dom7 as the tonic, but in every case I still hear it wanting to resolve cadentially.  The progressions that end on the dom7 tonics all feel unfinished to me.  There&apos;s nowhere in any of these where they hit a dom7 and I feel that &quot;ah...&quot; (sigh of satisfaction) that that a V7-I cadence brings.  Not that I think these tracks sound &quot;wrong&quot; or anything, it&apos;s a whole different kind of musical logic.  My point is not that a 4:5:6:7 can&apos;t be used as a tonic chord (that&apos;s patently false), just that you can&apos;t resolve to a 4:5:6:7 with the same drop in tension as when resolving to a straight 4:5:6...unless perhaps you&apos;re coming from an even higher-tension chord, maybe some kind of 9th or 11th chord.

Music is about creating tension and relaxation.  Its one<br/>of the things we learned when we analyzed music chord by chord and note by<br/>note to reveal how it functioned - how composers solved compositional<br/>problems. The rules we learned did not of course exist forever. Just like us<br/>the composers back then were exploring / discovering. In context a bit was<br/>discussed on how the transition from vocal music to instrumental music and<br/>the collapse of the variety of meantone into 12 equal offer opportunity and<br/>also lost nuance.

I am a certified addict to the barbershop 4:5:6:7 chord. I automatically try to put every melody I hear to barbershop, and look for plugging in dominant 7ths and particularly German 6th&apos;s wherever I can justify it. So contrary to trying to get rid of tritones, I find it way up there with caffeine, alcohol, sugar and nicotine in its addictiveness. This could be why I&apos;ve finding the newer symphonies written in the 20th century as being &quot;diet classical music&quot;.</p><p>It does seem curious that a triad has not been described as wanting to resolve it&apos;s one 5-limit tone - the major 3rd - to an open 5th, 4th or octave. But the ear, upon hearing a dominant 7th, has come to expect a cadence to occur that resolves the 7th of the chord down (or in the case of the augmented 6th, up). I would expect that the ear becomes ambivalent upon hearing the dominant 7th simply because this set of notes has more than one viable harmonic justification. A strong tendency to resolve it down a fifth to a tonic can easily be based on hearing it as a 36:45:54:64 tuning found in the 5-limit just major scale. An ear that has been exposed to a lot of barbershop will probably find itself resolving it as an augmented 6th (128:160:192:225). You may note that both these tunings have in common the fact that it is the 7th of the chord (or augmented 6th) which is throwing the tuning way up into the stratosphere in the harmonic series (the triad is the 4:5:6 in all three of them), while the simple 4:5:6:7 does not.</p><p>The blues style of music that is totally content to play the dominant at the end of a song without resolving it could well have its basic in the hearing of a true septimal tuning.</p><p>Billy</p></div><h3><a id=98005 href="#98005">ðŸ”—</a>cityoftheasleep &#x3C;igliashon@...&#x3E;</h3><span>4/14/2011 7:08:14 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;Carl Lumma&quot; &lt;carl@...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt; There&apos;s been a lot of this kind of stuff around here lately,<br/>&gt; and Mike and I were talking about it offlist, so please let<br/>&gt; me reiterate what I wrote to Mike:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; * Nobody, not even you, cares how it sounds to you. *</p><p>What does that even mean?  How do I not care how something sounds to me?</p><p>&gt; I realize this can make composing difficult.  But that is<br/>&gt; precisely the challenge of xenharmonic music.

Are you saying that nothing that we&apos;ve learned can be applied to microtonal systems?</p><p>&gt; This is especially true for musicians -- and I think most<br/>&gt; of us here probably had decent 12-ET chops before coming to<br/>&gt; microtonality.  So in addition to the problems faced by<br/>&gt; medieval composers who tried to write like Debussy, we face<br/>&gt; the additional hardship of having to *unlearn* the ingrained<br/>&gt; patterns we&apos;ve known since birth.</p><p>Do we?  I haven&apos;t yet felt the need to unlearn anything.  Am I doing something wrong?</p><p>&gt; What does this mean?  First, the notion of *keeping an open<br/>&gt; mind* should be elevated to the status of mantra.  Of course,<br/>&gt; when making music we need to use our ears and our emotional<br/>&gt; reactions.  But we can reserve judgment and keep trying new<br/>&gt; things even as we do so.  And certainly we don&apos;t have to<br/>&gt; write into a mailing list about how, &apos;No, sorry, it&apos;s<br/>&gt; impossible, because I don&apos;t hear it that way, because I always<br/>&gt; hear a half-step that wants to resolve to the nearest 12-ET<br/>&gt; degree&apos; or &apos;My psychoacoustic chunking periodicity detector<br/>&gt; is tingling that this sounds like a &quot;major third&quot;.&apos;  Because<br/>&gt; saying things like that is counterproductive.</p><p>We cannot expect the whole world, or even a few people, to &quot;unlearn&quot; a lifetime of pattern-recognition programming just so that they can enjoy our music properly.  I&apos;m all for keeping an open mind too, but there comes a point where you have to abandon a line of inquiry after it&apos;s repeatedly failed to satisfy one&apos;s goals.</p><p>I&apos;m not hating on 4:5:6:7 or saying it&apos;s unmusical or that it&apos;s too tense or anything like that; I&apos;m just saying that no matter how you gussy it up, it sounds like a dom7 chord, and it&apos;s going to sound that way to most listeners.  Rather than being a &quot;natural evolution&quot; of tonality analogous to the addition of 5-limit harmony to Pythagorean music, it&apos;s just going to make everything sound generically &quot;jazzy&quot;, which to me isn&apos;t all that remarkable.</p><p>Okay, maybe jazz *is* a natural evolution of tonality, and a system like 22-EDO that renders jazz chords closer to JI might be worthwhile to some people.  But if that&apos;s really the case, the revolution is already at hand and doesn&apos;t really need microtonality to take it further--as you say, barbershop quartets have already been at it for almost a century, to say nothing of the rest of the jazz-influenced musical world.</p><p>I gave that approach a fair shake, I believe--the first several systems I explored (31-EDO, 22-EDO, and Catler&apos;s 12-tone Ultra Plus) were all supposed to demonstrate the &quot;magical&quot; properties of smoother 7-limit harmonies, and in fact quite a few of the other systems I&apos;ve explored more recently (15, 16, and 20-EDO) all hit the 7th harmonic pretty well...but sorry, it&apos;s never sounded like anything more than a dom7 to me.  If after almost eight years of work and exploration that prejudice hasn&apos;t budged, why should I expect anything different after another 8 years?  Let alone anything different from other human beings who would listen to my music?  To me, that line of inquiry seems dead as a door-nail.</p><p>I&apos;ll admit, 16&apos;s version of Lemba[6] (or whatever you want to call its 4L+2s scale) and its good 4:5:7 triads pushes a couple interesting buttons for me, but I&apos;d be lying if I said it didn&apos;t feel remarkably like the whole-tone scale most of the time.  If I have to unlearn my lifetime of perceptual biases for it not to sound that way, I don&apos;t see the point in it.  For me, the point of microtonal music is to find stuff that turns my biases on their heads and freaks me out a bit in the process, but is just accessible enough to keep me coming back for more.

I never thought the<br/>chords were tense - quite the opposite. When I was in college<br/>I joined the JI network and got some tapes with 7-limit chords<br/>in other contexts. I thought they sounded out-of-tune. Then<br/>one day I was listening to barbershop and my ear did a 360<br/>and suddenly recognized the 7-limit intervals in the music.<br/>I&apos;d gained the ability to listen analytically to barbershop.<br/>After that the recordings from the JI network sounded great!<br/>List regulars are tired of this story by now, and probably I<br/>should stop telling it.  I guess my barbershop experience did<br/>give me a way of hearing 4:5:6:7 chords as basic consonances,<br/>but I&apos;m not claiming any kind of golden hearing. I have loads<br/>of trouble finding melodies and progressions in xenharmonic<br/>systems that sound &apos;natural&apos; to me. Then I hear somebody like<br/>you, Petr, Knowsur, Herman hit one out of the park in the same<br/>system and I&apos;m like, Oh, that&apos;s what it sounds like!</p><p>At barbershop boot camp somebody told me their chorus was<br/>rehearsing with a conductor who had perfect pitch, for a<br/>joint concert they were doing. Apparently the guy totally<br/>freaked because he kept hearing that the chorus was out of<br/>tune but couldn&apos;t reconcile it with the fact that it sounded<br/>perfectly fine.</p><p>&gt; I really don&apos;t get what you&apos;re suggesting.  Do you think that<br/>&gt; if I somehow locked myself away from the musical cultural<br/>&gt; background and forced myself to play and compose in a system<br/>&gt; where I used 4:5:6:7&apos;s as the base consonance, I could get to<br/>&gt; a point where it no longer retains the 12-TET associations it<br/>&gt; currently has for me?</p><p>I&apos;m saying we should work hard to avoid the assumption that<br/>everything we hear is inherent in the intervals or chords,<br/>and that others must hear it the same way.  This was my general<br/>point not aimed specifically at you.  You said 7:5 has a<br/>tension that&apos;s undeniable.  I don&apos;t think it&apos;s inherently more<br/>tense than any other dyad with n*d ~ 35.  Try a raw listening<br/>comparison and see if you agree.  I think it sounds tense when<br/>it reminds us of progressions where the its cousin&apos;s proximity<br/>to 3:2 (and especially to the tonic 3:2) was used to create and<br/>resolve tension.</p><p>-Carl</p></div><h3><a id=98022 href="#98022">ðŸ”—</a>Mike Battaglia &#x3C;battaglia01@...&#x3E;</h3><span>4/14/2011 11:06:24 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>On Thu, Apr 14, 2011 at 4:58 PM, Chris Vaisvil &lt;chrisvaisvil@...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; My renderings of your pieces did not require any more detail than you already had.

By now<br/>you should have been surprised.  I&apos;ll add myself to the<br/>list.  I don&apos;t hear &quot;12-ET-based functions&quot; when I hear a<br/>4:5:6:7.  I don&apos;t even know what a 12-ET-based function<br/>would sound like.  4:5:6:7 sounds like a pure chord, and the<br/>12-ET dominant seventh doesn&apos;t. I never hear the half-octave<br/>&quot;wanting to resolve&quot; a particular way.

It may help to treat<br/>the 7 as a dissonance when you use it first.</p><p>Another problem with 4:5:6:7 is that it sounds too pure and<br/>fused.  It doesn&apos;t bring an interesting new sonority to the<br/>table.

I don&apos;t think most listeners out there in the<br/>big wide world are at all sensitive to the Common Practice<br/>formula for treatment of dominant sevenths.  A lot of us<br/>are attuned to the liberal use of seventh chords in rock<br/>and blues.  They have a spicy feel and can you can use one<br/>as the tonic.

I<br/>have noticed that you don&apos;t focus on microtonal harmony.<br/>Your Map of an Internal Landscape (that&apos;s you, right?) is<br/>good microtonal music, but it doesn&apos;t have much harmony.<br/>Or, at least, the harmony is kept in the background. Whereas<br/>your 12-TET music uses conventional harmonic patterns.  So<br/>it sounds like you didn&apos;t find new patterns you liked in<br/>the new systems. Something more recent has more harmony,<br/>but it doesn&apos;t have the &quot;wow factor&quot;, in harmonic terms,<br/>that some of Gene&apos;s and George&apos;s music (and I hope some of<br/>mine) does.  And then you say you don&apos;t see the point of<br/>close approximations to simple ratios, that they don&apos;t have<br/>musical value for you.

The instrumentation is the reverse of that in contemporary conception- today it is the violin which is the symbol of &quot;high culture&quot; (f*cking monolingual communication, it&apos;s better as Hochkultur) and the guitars are in the hands of the &quot;devils&quot;.</p><p>On the other hand, or hoof, it is the most odiferous of manure to ignore the value of the perceptions of the creators in the moment, and the most paralizing position, as far as making music, is to feel too strongly the weight of history past, present and future and not be able to say fukkit and just create. :-)</p><p>&gt;</p></div><h3><a id=98027 href="#98027">ðŸ”—</a>lobawad &#x3C;lobawad@...&#x3E;</h3><span>4/15/2011 2:05:49 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>&quot;Dominant&quot; is a description of function, not of a reified sonority.

But the</p><p>&gt; point is that the difference between a 12-TET dom7 and a</p><p>&gt; 4:5:6:7 is pretty much negligible in terms of at least my</p><p>&gt; own categorical perception, even after years of playing</p><p>&gt; microtonal music.  Thus the association between a 4:5:6:7</p><p>&gt; and the 12-ET-based functions of a dominant 7th is a</p><p>&gt; difficult one to break.  I&apos;d honestly be surprised if</p><p>&gt; other people have a drastically different view on the</p><p>&gt; matter, such that the functional and/or generically</p><p>&gt; &quot;jazzy&quot; connotations of the 12-ET dominant 7th chord</p><p>&gt; don&apos;t overwhelmingly color perception of 4:5:6:7 chords.</p><p>You&apos;re still saying you &quot;would be&quot; surprised when people</p><p>have already told you they have a different view.

I don&apos;t even know what a 12-ET-based function</p><p>would sound like.  4:5:6:7 sounds like a pure chord, and the</p><p>12-ET dominant seventh doesn&apos;t.

I always thought</p><p>that was a convenient fiction harmony teachers use to</p><p>explain conventional chord sequences (which sound fine;</p><p>I&apos;m not knocking them).</p><p>I can hear the 7 of 4:5:6:7 as being out of tune.

And also, I&apos;ve tried out a bunch of progressions that are supposed to resolve to a 4:5:6:7, and for every one I&apos;ve tried tacking on a 4:5:6 a 3/2 below the &quot;tonic&quot;, and to me that latter chord sounds &quot;even more&quot; resolved every time.  I&apos;m not saying that ending on a 4:5:6:7 feels intolerably tense to me, like ending on an augmented chord would, just that dropping the 7 from it makes it sound more resolved.  I would be surprised if anyone here felt that the 7 actually enhanced the feeling of resolution.</p><p>&gt; I guess my barbershop experience did<br/>&gt; give me a way of hearing 4:5:6:7 chords as basic consonances,<br/>&gt; but I&apos;m not claiming any kind of golden hearing.</p><p>The thing is, though, in barbershop they don&apos;t add the 7th to every chord, or even the majority of chords.

Apparently the guy totally<br/>&gt; freaked because he kept hearing that the chorus was out of<br/>&gt; tune but couldn&apos;t reconcile it with the fact that it sounded<br/>&gt; perfectly fine.</p><p>I&apos;ve always wondered how &quot;perfect pitch&quot; would interact with JI.</p><p>&gt; I&apos;m saying we should work hard to avoid the assumption that<br/>&gt; everything we hear is inherent in the intervals or chords,<br/>&gt; and that others must hear it the same way.  This was my general<br/>&gt; point not aimed specifically at you.</p><p>First of all, I don&apos;t like to talk about intervals having properties that are somehow objective, which they could possess in absence of listeners.  A musical interval isn&apos;t just a relationship between two tones, it&apos;s a relationship between those two tones and a listener.  So when I talk about something &quot;inherent&quot; or &quot;undeniable&quot;, I&apos;m not talking universal...I&apos;ll be damned if I have any idea what constitutes harmonic tension to Indonesian or Middle Eastern musicians, for instance.  The only assumptions I&apos;m making are about people on this list and people who are likely to hear my music--which is to say, people who have been overwhelmingly acculturated to Western musical norms.</p><p>I don&apos;t see why it should be unreasonable to make assumptions about intervallic perception within this group.  If I&apos;m going to talk about music with other people, I have to assume that we have at least a modicum of shared perceptual experience, or else I might as well be talking to a tree for all the good it will do me.  If people don&apos;t hear the way I do, they won&apos;t be able to tell me anything useful about the music I&apos;m making (or wish to make).</p><p>&gt; You said 7:5 has a<br/>&gt; tension that&apos;s undeniable.  I don&apos;t think it&apos;s inherently more<br/>&gt; tense than any other dyad with n*d ~ 35.  Try a raw listening<br/>&gt; comparison and see if you agree.  I think it sounds tense when<br/>&gt; it reminds us of progressions where the its cousin&apos;s proximity<br/>&gt; to 3:2 (and especially to the tonic 3:2) was used to create and<br/>&gt; resolve tension.</p><p>I once spent a day indexing triads within the first 16 harmonics according to the &quot;feeling&quot; they gave me.  5:6:7 felt undeniably more tense to me than anything below it and many things above it.  But anyway I&apos;ve also done simpler dyadic listening tests.  Dyads with n*d around 35 include 6/5, 10/3, 11/3, 7/5, 9/4, and 8/5.  7/5 and 8/5 feel considerably more tense than the others, and even in a vacuum surrounded by no other intervals, I hear both as wanting to resolve toward 3/2.  6/5 I do not hear as wanting to &quot;move&quot; very strongly at all; 9/4 might want to move down to a 2/1, but not very strongly.  11/3 feels tense in the &quot;slightly stress-inducing&quot; sense but doesn&apos;t give me a clear feeling of wanting to move one way or the other.  If we kick up n*d a bit and let in 7/6, that&apos;s another one that feels stable; same with 9/5.  And interestingly, I almost always hear a 4/3 as wanting to move down to a 5/4.</p><p>Note that I don&apos;t ascribe this to the intervals, but to my hearing of them.  I won&apos;t deny that my acculturation undoubtedly explains this, but we&apos;re all acculturated to something, so why ignore that?

Someday, I&apos;d like to<br/>be able to speak about this sort of thing by talking about epinephrine<br/>responses in the central nervous system, but we aren&apos;t there yet.<br/>Nonetheless, the observation itself is valid - that these higher-limit<br/>chords can be, sometimes, discordant! - but are still &quot;rooted,&quot; high<br/>in tonalness, not inharmonic, etc.</p><p>That they have these characteristics is why I&apos;m a fan of the notion<br/>that higher-limit chords resolve to lower ones - especially if the<br/>higher-limit chord is mistuned. The net effect is that of a<br/>&quot;commanding,&quot; somewhat tense, but still very &quot;otonal&quot; chord with a<br/>clear virtual pitch resolving to a much less tense and also rooted<br/>chord a 3/2 away - what could be more satisfying than that?</p><p>I note my example didn&apos;t work in 19-equal as well as it did in 12,<br/>which may suggest that mistuning of the higher-limit chord &quot;properly&quot;<br/>is really important.

A<br/>final note: play around with some 7 and 11-limit tetrads with the 7<br/>and 11 lowered in volume - play around with the exact degree of<br/>lowering - you might find you like them more.</p><p>-Mike</p><p>PS: perfect pitch in JI so far works... Not well. I basically have<br/>relative pitch in JI like people do in 12, meaning they memorize a<br/>single note&apos;s pitch chroma and get the rest via relative pitch from<br/>that note.

If we can do that, we can hence find the tunings that are &quot;just novel enough&quot; to blow people&apos;s minds. Or perhaps it&apos;s a matter of working within a new feature space that is different from the one people have, but just similar enough to provide novelty that way. That is, we often talk about what music might sound like 200 years from now, but we don&apos;t live 200 years from now, and I wish I had a way to predict which tunings people will &quot;get&quot; as of 2011.

And, yes, the<br/>&gt; 5-limit sounds good, doesn&apos;t it?</p><p>Yep.</p><p>&gt; Oh, yes, and the main point of this piece is that it uses<br/>&gt; both the pure 7-limit seventh chords and a 5-limit<br/>&gt; rendering of a traditional dominant seventh (with 11-limit<br/>&gt; implications).  My surprise, on first listen, was how *bad*<br/>&gt; and out of tune the extended 5-limit chord sounded.</p><p>Indeed, tuning a 5-limit dominant 7th tends to sound horrible.  In that regard, 12-TET&apos;s error/ambiguity actually seems to work in its favor, since in 19 the diatonic dominant 7th sounds atrocious compared to the augmented 6th.</p><p>&gt; Paul Erlich&apos;s &quot;Decatonic Swing&quot; is a good example of<br/>&gt; 7-limit harmony.  I believe it&apos;s all seventh chords, and<br/>&gt; they work.  Even given the poor approximations of<br/>&gt; Pajara/22, the harmonic logic makes sense.</p><p>I&apos;m not saying 7-limit harmony doesn&apos;t &quot;work&quot;.  I&apos;m saying it doesn&apos;t work analogously to 5-limit harmony.</p><p>&gt; You&apos;re still saying you &quot;would be&quot; surprised when people<br/>&gt; have already told you they have a different view.</p><p>No, they really haven&apos;t.  Slightly different views have been expressed, but no one seems to hear a 4:5:6:7 as being entirely unlike a dominant 7th.</p><p>&gt; By now<br/>&gt; you should have been surprised.  I&apos;ll add myself to the<br/>&gt; list.  I don&apos;t hear &quot;12-ET-based functions&quot; when I hear a<br/>&gt; 4:5:6:7.  I don&apos;t even know what a 12-ET-based function<br/>&gt; would sound like.  4:5:6:7 sounds like a pure chord, and the<br/>&gt; 12-ET dominant seventh doesn&apos;t. I never hear the half-octave<br/>&gt; &quot;wanting to resolve&quot; a particular way.  I always thought<br/>&gt; that was a convenient fiction harmony teachers use to<br/>&gt; explain conventional chord sequences (which sound fine;<br/>&gt; I&apos;m not knocking them).</p><p>Well, color me surprised by your views.</p><p>&gt; I can hear the 7 of 4:5:6:7 as being out of tune.  So can<br/>&gt; the 5 for that matter.  I think it&apos;s because they&apos;re<br/>&gt; outside the expected melodic framework.  The solution is to<br/>&gt; emphasize different melodic patterns.  It may help to treat<br/>&gt; the 7 as a dissonance when you use it first.</p><p>Wouldn&apos;t that be defeating the purpose of using 4:5:6:7 as a base harmonic unit analogous to a 4:5:6?</p><p>&gt; Another problem with 4:5:6:7 is that it sounds too pure and<br/>&gt; fused.  It doesn&apos;t bring an interesting new sonority to the<br/>&gt; table.  The solution there is to tie it in with scrunchier<br/>&gt; chords that hold the 7.</p><p>That&apos;s also kind of beside the point I was trying to make.</p><p>&gt; I don&apos;t think functional considerations are leading me<br/>&gt; anywhere.  I don&apos;t think most listeners out there in the<br/>&gt; big wide world are at all sensitive to the Common Practice<br/>&gt; formula for treatment of dominant sevenths.</p><p>Really?  You don&apos;t hear a G7 progressing to a C major (in 12-ET or any other meantone or pythagorean tuning) as being a strong, natural, resolved progression?  You don&apos;t think most people hear it that way?  The &quot;rules&quot; of common practice are totally arbitrary and not at all based in some fundamental aspect of hearing?</p><p>&gt; A lot of us<br/>&gt; are attuned to the liberal use of seventh chords in rock<br/>&gt; and blues.  They have a spicy feel and can you can use one<br/>&gt; as the tonic.  I don&apos;t find a 4:5:6:7 has the same feel at<br/>&gt; all so I don&apos;t think it&apos;s altering my perceptions, other<br/>&gt; than making be receptive to the use of the 7 as coloration.</p><p>Jon Catler would disagree with you, and so (I would suspect) harmonic entropy.  The canonical line I&apos;ve always heard from people in the tuning community is 12-TET&apos;s dominant 7th chords are just out-of-tune septimal otonalities.  I&apos;ll admit a reasonably-pure 4:5:6:7 lacks the spiciness of 12-TET, but Catler sure rocks them pretty hard in his own blues and it seems to work.</p><p>&gt; I don&apos;t know how strong the associations are for you.  I<br/>&gt; have noticed that you don&apos;t focus on microtonal harmony.</p><p>That&apos;s not entirely true.  Just because I don&apos;t focus on integrating extended JI (or temperaments thereof) doesn&apos;t mean I don&apos;t focus on harmony.  Quite the contrary, the coloration of different (and extreme) mistunings of standard 5-limit chords is pretty much an integral feature of my music.</p><p>&gt; Your Map of an Internal Landscape (that&apos;s you, right?) is<br/>&gt; good microtonal music, but it doesn&apos;t have much harmony.</p><p>It&apos;s got as much harmony as most music in the same genre, i.e. rock or pop.  Almost every single track has at least triadic harmony happening, except for the tracks in 11, 23, and 28 (because at the time I was a bit more conservative with using wonky 3-limit approximations).  But indeed I paid more attention to melodies and root movements, since that seemed like a better starting-place for exploration.  Getting some basics down first seemed a more sensible move than trying to go whole-hog for extended otonalities (which I generally dislike, even when Just).</p><p>&gt; Or, at least, the harmony is kept in the background. Whereas<br/>&gt; your 12-TET music uses conventional harmonic patterns.  So<br/>&gt; it sounds like you didn&apos;t find new patterns you liked in<br/>&gt; the new systems. Something more recent has more harmony,<br/>&gt; but it doesn&apos;t have the &quot;wow factor&quot;, in harmonic terms,<br/>&gt; that some of Gene&apos;s and George&apos;s music (and I hope some of<br/>&gt; mine) does.</p><p>Gene&apos;s music gets its wow factor for me mainly because he&apos;s juggling so many notes, and George&apos;s I really haven&apos;t heard any of except for his 11-EDO piece (which was awesome).  Your work reminds me a lot of Gene&apos;s, in that both have some really funky alien progressions that definitely require me to work against my &quot;programming&quot; (though I rarely succeed).  To be frank, though, I think that bringing in totally unusual harmonies as well as very unusual and complex scales, and doing very intricate and complex things with these harmonies and scales, is an approach that it&apos;s a bit too ahead of its time for me.  It&apos;s hard for me to make it through an entire piece by either of you because I feel like there&apos;s nothing for me to latch on to.  Neither of you write particularly rhythmically-oriented music, either, so there isn&apos;t even that as a &quot;safety-net&quot;.  But hey, to each his own.  The both of you come from very different musical backgrounds than I do and have a very different set of goals.  But anyway the point is that my &quot;lack of focus&quot; on extended harmony probably makes more sense if you take into account my background and the &quot;compositional problems&quot; I turned to microtonality to solve.</p><p>&gt; And then you say you don&apos;t see the point of<br/>&gt; close approximations to simple ratios, that they don&apos;t have<br/>&gt; musical value for you.

I&apos;d be willing to bet good money that if you ask a barbershop quartet to sing you G-B-D-F, they&apos;ll sing you a 4:5:6:7.  If that is in fact the case, that suggests to me that given freedom of intonation, people tune a dominant 7th as a 4:5:6:7, rather than anything more harmonically complex, which seems to support the canonical line coming out of the JI network.</p><p>But all of this is beside the point I was originally trying to make.  My whole issue of a septimal otonality sounding like a dominant 7th chord was supposed to be nothing more than an illustration of my disagreement with the idea that music based on septimal otonalities is the logical evolution of 5-limit music.  Basically, I think the 7-limit is already implied in a lot of 5-limit music in the form of the dominant 7th (or augmented 6th, whatever, it doesn&apos;t matter), so if we look at the places 7 is implied, it sort of already has a functionality relative to the standard 5-limit palette.  Regardless of whether we&apos;re talking classical functionality or jazz functionality or barbershop functionality, hearing a 7-limit otonality is almost certainly going to evoke those well-established associations in listeners that have them.</p><p>Unless, of course, that otonality is located firmly in a functionality that isn&apos;t really analogous to 5-limit meantone functionality.  But in order to take the 7-limit to a place where people stop associating it with its established implications in a meantone or pythagorean system, we&apos;re almost certainly going to have to produce a tonal system that&apos;s going to be beyond comprehension to most listeners.  Mostly because any scale that&apos;s going to produce a multitude of decently-tuned 4:5:6:7 chords, without being related to something familiar like meantone or diminished, is going to be absurdly complex compared to meantone and/or 12-TET, thus causing people accustomed to 12-TET to scratch their heads and flip the channel.  If some of you don&apos;t care about that, fine, but that&apos;s beside the point.</p><p>It&apos;s just like how most listeners don&apos;t give a damn whether they hear meantone 5-limit 3rd or a 3-limit Pythagorean one.  In any case, whatever evolutionary chutzpah a 7-limit-based tonal system might possess, it will almost certainly come from the rise in scalar complexity and the unusual/complex &quot;byproduct&quot; intervals it produces, rather than any amazing novelty of the 7-limit harmonies.  This is patently obvious in Graham&apos;s and Gene&apos;s music, which would sound just as insane and forward-thinking with the 7ths dropped as otherwise, because those two use such bizarre and un-meantone-like scales.  This is also why music in Pajara temperament universally fails to freak people out--you can play the same shit in 12 and it&apos;ll just sound a bit more out-of-tune, but still get the same point across.  So what&apos;s the big to-do about the 7th harmonic?</p><p>-Igs</p><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;lobawad&quot; &lt;lobawad@...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Statistical analysis has been done, I don&apos;t know how formally.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; As you can analize by simply listening, seventh chords are the signature sound of barbershop<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;  The relevant quote from this book<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=4N6Q7dYV2FoC&dq=isbn:0195116720&hl=sl&ei=HAOpTf3vIo_FswbMkNWZBw&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=1&ved=0CCcQ6AEwAA">http://books.google.com/books?id=4N6Q7dYV2FoC&dq=isbn:0195116720&hl=sl&ei=HAOpTf3vIo_FswbMkNWZBw&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=1&ved=0CCcQ6AEwAA</a><br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; on Wikipedia gives &quot;35 to 60 percent&quot;. &quot;About half&quot; would be my guess from remembered listening experience, so that sounds right on to me.

Myna and meantone are generally comparable in complexity, but differ in the details.</p></div><h3><a id=98068 href="#98068">ðŸ”—</a>Carl Lumma &#x3C;carl@...&#x3E;</h3><span>4/16/2011 12:43:34 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- &quot;lobawad&quot; &lt;lobawad@...&gt; wrote:</p><p>&gt; Considering how they tend to really lean into those seventh<br/>&gt; chords, &quot;most&quot; isn&apos;t really an exaggeration.</p><p>Good choice of words - they lean in figuratively and literally!</p><p>Couldn&apos;t find an ideal example on youtube, but this will do<br/><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7mGjSZpdpk&#t=4m20s">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7mGjSZpdpk&#t=4m20s</a></p><p>-Carl</p></div><h3><a id=98069 href="#98069">ðŸ”—</a>Kalle Aho &#x3C;kalleaho@...&#x3E;</h3><span>4/16/2011 3:17:40 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;Carl Lumma&quot; &lt;carl@...&gt; wrote:</p><p>&gt; The old thread on this had monz making several versions of<br/>&gt; the dominant cadence in JI.

I was talking about this there:</p><p><a href="http://launch.groups.yahoo.com/group/tuning/message/85555">http://launch.groups.yahoo.com/group/tuning/message/85555</a></p><p>I then responded with &quot;what about parabolic waves, which are 1/N^2<br/>rolloff, all harmonics present,&quot; and you also said that that&apos;d be<br/>better than a sawtooth. Maybe at the time you were just talking about<br/>timbres that most closely approximate the human voice, but I thought<br/>the greater point was that timbres with a 1/N^2 rolloff are generally<br/>closer to a more &quot;perfectly concordant sound&quot; than those with a 1/N<br/>rolloff. I&apos;ve been talking about using parabolic waves as &quot;ideal,&quot;<br/>archetype waveforms for the cross-correlation &quot;filterbank&quot; for like<br/>1-2 years now, and you were always onboard.</p><p>Anyway, the point is - even if you disagree, go listen to those &quot;buzz<br/>wave&quot; examples again from the periodicity buzz tests. Those are<br/>impulse trains, which are differentiated sawtooths. All harmonics<br/>present, equal volume. This means the harmonics stick out and don&apos;t<br/>&quot;fuse&quot; as nicely as if they were rolling off. This also means that the<br/>resulting waveform sounds like you&apos;re being stabbed in the ear with a<br/>rusty knife. On the other hand, sines don&apos;t sound like this, but then<br/>they don&apos;t produce the &quot;clearest&quot; sounding pitch, either. Thus the<br/>ideal rolloff is somewhere between just one sine wave, and all<br/>harmonics equal.</p><p>&gt; &gt; They are relevant because the answers tell us things about<br/>&gt; &gt; the kind of spectrum that we tend to perceive as being<br/>&gt; &gt; maximally concordant.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; A chord is not a waveform. It&apos;s an abstraction represnting<br/>&gt; musical sounds which may come from different sources / vary<br/>&gt; in a lot of ways. One of them is phase, which changes the<br/>&gt; wave shape more than it does the sound.</p><p>OK, and all of that applies to timbre as well. We are assuming that<br/>for any of this to matter at all, there exists a central pitch<br/>processor that is attempting to fuse all of this mess into a single VF<br/>at all times, regardless of where the sources are coming from. This<br/>applies even if instead of a chord, we&apos;re talking about a timbre, in<br/>which harmonics are being played to alternating ears with different<br/>phases - a VF will still be produced. Thus, with a chord, even if the<br/>sources in real life exhibit phase irregularities, differences in<br/>inter-aural spatialization cues, F0 estimation will be taking place<br/>regardless. If it wasn&apos;t, then there&apos;d be no point in us talking<br/>meaningfully about &quot;4:5:6&quot; to begin with.</p><p>As for phase, 100% phase synchronicity between harmonics rarely occurs<br/>in real life. It certainly doesn&apos;t occur in a reverberant hall, where<br/>the sound of reverb is actually caused by making random adjustments to<br/>the phase of each sine. Nonetheless, that doesn&apos;t interfere with F0<br/>estimation. Sometimes it really does, as in the case of the<br/>periodicity buzz examples with impulse trains of varying phases, so I<br/>may have to concede your point a little bit. But that behavior didn&apos;t<br/>really occur until you had like 30+ harmonics involved, and when there<br/>were a huge amount of fully unresolved upper harmonics at equal<br/>volume, so if we&apos;re sticking to discussing 7-15 limit otonalities in<br/>which the harmonics are mostly resolved, it wouldn&apos;t be as relevant.</p><p>For the moment, I&apos;m isolating the analysis to a chord that is produced<br/>by one sound source - a speaker, since that&apos;s the main thing that most<br/>of us have listened to any of this stuff on.</p><p>&gt; But even in a<br/>&gt; lab-type setting, rolling off chord fundamentals at 6dB/oct<br/>&gt; does not (for example) produce a sawtooth, since amplitudes<br/>&gt; of coinciding partials add. So if you want to draw a<br/>&gt; comparison here you&apos;ll need to be more specific.</p><p>Right, and as I told Gene, I&apos;m being generous - a 1:2:3:4:5:6:7:8:...<br/>timbre is a &quot;chord&quot; where all of the &quot;notes&quot; have sine wave timbres.<br/>If you actually wanted to play a 1:2:3:4:5:6:7:8:... chord with<br/>sawtooth waves, that would be even harsher, as you&apos;d end up with a<br/>negative rolloff where upper harmonics are louder in volume than lower<br/>ones. A 1:2:3:4:5:6:7:8:... chord where each successive note and its<br/>harmonics are placed at an 1/N rolloff would yield some kind of<br/>interesting &quot;prime-sieving&quot; rolloff where primes have a lower<br/>amplitude than everything else. We can start to understand and predict<br/>the concordance of complex spectra such as these by first considering<br/>the concordance of simpler spectra.</p><p>-Mike</p></div><h3><a id=98071 href="#98071">ðŸ”—</a>cityoftheasleep &#x3C;igliashon@...&#x3E;</h3><span>4/16/2011 9:43:11 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;genewardsmith&quot; &lt;genewardsmith@...&gt; wrote:</p><p>&gt; The complexity of an otonal tetrad in meantone is 10.

The other drawback<br/>is that processing may be hierarchical to some degree,<br/>especially if the individual tones are separated by spatial or<br/>timing cues (also averaged away in the &quot;chord&quot; abstraction).<br/>However it might still be interesting.

A more reasonable complaint<br/>&gt; would be that there are too many improper scales, but if you are seeking to escape the<br/>&gt; usual that should not worry you.</p><p>I&apos;ve ranted too much and obscured my own point.  Let me try again to clear up what I&apos;m all hot and bothered about.  There&apos;s a narrow field of &quot;pleasant and rewarding novelty&quot; between the realm of the &quot;too familiar&quot; and the &quot;alien/unintelligible&quot;.  Most of the microtonal systems I don&apos;t like fall within the &quot;too familiar&quot;, but ironically many of the &quot;alien/unintelligible&quot; have been discovered by looking for systems based on an all-too-familiar harmonic unit: the septimal tetrad.  For the record, so have many systems that I&apos;d call &quot;pleasantly novel&quot;--such as the ones you mentioned above--but they get their novelty for reasons unrelated to the motivations that led to their discovery.</p><p>All I&apos;m saying that most high-accuracy temperaments that give abundant septimal otonal tetrads produce scales that are either a) too familiar or b) too outlandish (too improper, too large, etc.) to be intelligible to me (let alone a naive listener).  Call me Goldilocks, because I&apos;m looking for things that are &quot;just right&quot;--novel-sounding, yet intelligible; enough familiarity to have appeal, but with enough of a twist to inspire a bit of a Keanu Reeves &quot;woah&quot; moment.  Most of the scales that provide this tend come from either 5-limit temperaments, subgroup temperaments, or (dare I say) exotemperaments.</p><p>&gt; Admittedly, I did give a whole slew of 12-note proper hobbit scales recently, under the &gt; dulusive belief that this is what people wanted. You can ignore them if you don&apos;t want<br/>&gt; them.</p><p>Not being MOS&apos;s, I&apos;d say your hobbits definitely go well outside of the familiar, but I haven&apos;t really spent enough time with them to form an opinion.  Mostly what I&apos;m talking about are the 7-to-13-limit rank 2 temperaments.</p><p>&gt; You are arguing out of both sides of your mouth. On the one hand, you want to get away &gt; from same-old-same-old. On the other, you complain of a dearth of 5-limit triads.</p><p>What I&apos;ve said from the beginning is that I do believe 4:5:6:7 can escape the &quot;pull&quot; of meantone/12-TET functionality if you can put it in a scale that&apos;s far enough removed from 12-TET structures.  The trouble is that any such scale is going to be of much higher complexity or much greater impropriety...or greater error.  Blackwood (or Blacksmith if we&apos;re using Middle Path names) is a great example of a scale totally divorced from 12-TET,  rich in septimal otonal tetrads, and exquisitely simple in structure, and I love it dearly and suspect you would too if the fifths were in-tune.</p><p>To clarify, what I consider &quot;familiar&quot; has less to do with harmony and more to do with scale structure, since 5-limit temperaments like Porcupine and Negripent have familiar harmonic units but sound anything but familiar as soon as the chords start moving.</p><p>&gt; Did it occur to you that people don&apos;t like to give reviews like &quot;your harmony made me<br/>&gt; puke?&quot;</p><p>If my harmony could literally caused vomiting in someone, I would be amazed and overcome with pride.  Quite the accomplishment it would be for my music to produce such a strong visceral response!  In all seriousness, though--if people find what I write unlistenable or unpleasant on account of the harmony, I would prefer to hear about it than not.  However, I really would be surprised to learn that the many people who have heaped praise on the various &quot;out-of-tune&quot; works produced by various list members were just &quot;being nice&quot; and actually found the works quite objectionable on account of the harmonies.</p><p>-Igs</p></div><h3><a id=98097 href="#98097">ðŸ”—</a>cityoftheasleep &#x3C;igliashon@...&#x3E;</h3><span>4/16/2011 6:38:39 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;Carl Lumma&quot; &lt;carl@...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt; Nope, I agree they must be discovered.

It looks like its roots were historical and practical as much as (or more than?) mathematical. We&apos;re used to hearing a 200-cent whole step; who cares what the prime number limits are?</p><p>Put another way: If a 996-cent 16/9 sounds more normal than a 7/4, then either the Tenney Height model isn&apos;t right in general, or the force of attraction of these traditional tones is stronger -- and therefore even more relevant -- than the Tenney Height. If it&apos;s the former, then comparing 12-EDO steps to lowish-Tenney-height JI intervals is mostly irrelevant; if it&apos;s the latter, then there&apos;s something about 12 EDO itself that&apos;s more important than the ratios that it&apos;s close to.</p><p>I&apos;m not saying that prime-limit ratios are irrelevant, but what if structure is just as important? There appear to be times when JI composers focus almost exclusively on the ratios involved, and mostly ignore, say, the fact that there are different sizes of scale steps; maybe there are times when step sizes are paramount and looking at ratios is mostly worthless.</p><p>&gt; There are also weird artifacts of 12EDO-ism in my own mind...like that<br/>&gt; 16/9 sounds more normal to me than 7/4 despite 7/4 being so much lower<br/>&gt; limit/Tenney Height/etc. or that the &quot;square root of 2&quot; tritone doesn&apos;t<br/>&gt; sound half as bad as its rational value implies or [snip]</p><p>Musically speaking -- as opposed to listening to dyads or scales outside of a larger musical context -- 12 EDO never seems to sound wrong. When I play around with scales, a 12 EDO piece of music has the potential to sound &quot;wrong&quot; or &quot;out of tune&quot; when rendered in a non-12 tuning, even if it&apos;s just Prinz or a Werckmeister temperament. When I pick a non-12 piece -- whether it&apos;s common-practice music from before the dominance of 12 EDO or one of my own attempts at composing outside of 12 EDO -- and render it with 12 EDO, it never sounds out of tune. Ugly, boring, inelegant, sure, but not &quot;out of tune&quot;.</p><p>The question is, should I care?</p><p>I don&apos;t really think so. Those are tones I&apos;m used to, as is most of the rest of the culture I&apos;m in.</p><p>It would be like caring about how common split-rail fencing is; I don&apos;t need to put one around my own house, but if I put a do something really interesting and unusual with my landscaping -- like planting specially pruned fruit trees at the edge of my yard, each having two branches going out from each side, trained to be level with the ground, and almost touching the tree next to it -- then I shouldn&apos;t be surprised if people see it as similar to a split-rail fence.

Probably I should have clarified this further.  In meantone harmony, we use 5-limit otonal and utonal triads as the &quot;base&quot; harmonic units, and an integral feature of tonality is the alternation and contrast between the otonal and the utonal.  That&apos;s the &quot;basic&quot; model and people deviate from it all the time in interesting ways (i.e. &quot;I am the Walrus&quot;) but when I talk about &quot;tonal&quot; music I mean the basic &quot;Theory 101&quot; shit.

It looks like its roots were historical<br/>&gt; and practical as much as (or more than?) mathematical.</p><p>The roots were historical, but that history is one of the<br/>development of a style of 5-limit harmony.  It&apos;s the story<br/>of the journey from meantone temperament, which tempers out<br/>81/80 only, to 12-ET, which additionally tempers out 128/125<br/>and 648/625.  This was understood by theorists here and<br/>there, but mostly it happened organically.  Only in the last<br/>several decades have theorists put it all together and made<br/>predictions about alternative ways the history might have<br/>gone -- tuning forks in the road, as it were.</p><p>&gt; Put another way: If a 996-cent 16/9 sounds more normal than<br/>&gt; a 7/4, then either the Tenney Height model isn&apos;t right in<br/>&gt; general, or the force of attraction of these traditional<br/>&gt; tones is stronger -- and therefore even  more relevant --<br/>&gt; than the Tenney Height.</p><p>As Gene says, Tenney height is about concordance, whereas the<br/>concept of a &quot;dominant chord&quot; is entirely due to the logic of<br/>functional harmony.  Concordance will influence which chords<br/>are chosen for which roles in a functional style, but other<br/>things are involved too.  I already mentioned vanishing commas,<br/>which have to do with how chords relate to one another in chord<br/>progressions.  And there are additional factors that aren&apos;t<br/>fully understood.</p><p>&gt; maybe there are times when step sizes are paramount and<br/>&gt; looking at ratios is mostly worthless.</p><p>It certainly is possible to write music where this is true.<br/>A solo monophonic line is a basic example.</p><p>&gt; When I pick a non-12 piece -- whether it&apos;s common-practice<br/>&gt; music from before the dominance of 12 EDO or one of my own<br/>&gt; attempts at composing outside of 12 EDO -- and render it<br/>&gt; with 12 EDO, it never sounds out of tune.

In that case, it&apos;s essentially the same as the 7-limit.<br/>2.5/3.7/3, however, is a 7-limit subgroup, the same as the 5-limit is.<br/> The question is analogous to whether you&apos;d put 5-limit meantone in<br/>the same group as 7-limit meantone.  Maybe with a focus on 26-equal,<br/>which is a meantone that doesn&apos;t extend well to the 7-limit with the<br/>standard mapping.</p><p>I think Gene&apos;s remark holds.  Meantone would still be meantone, but<br/>how you thought of it would be different.  This is an important point.</p><p>Magic is ideal in the 9-limit but also works in the 11-limit.  You<br/>don&apos;t need full pentads for the 9-limit harmony to shine through --<br/>you can mix 5-limit chords with &quot;sus4&quot; and 6:7:9 approximations.  If<br/>you add more notes to get those 9-limit pentads, what you have will<br/>still be magic, but how you think of it will be different.  You can<br/>also note that some dissonances have 11-limit rationalizations.</p><p>Orwell was first noted (that I&apos;m aware of) in the 11-limit.  You may<br/>approach it as a 7-limit temperament, but note that the dissonances<br/>have 11-limit rationalizations.  You&apos;re bound to hit those dissonances<br/>because they&apos;re some of the simplest intervals.  You may treat it as a<br/>small scale with incomplete 11-limit harmony from the start.  Or you<br/>may treat it as a system for allowing puns in full 11-limit harmony<br/>without looking at scales.  You can even start with 13-limit subgroups<br/>(that may entail the variant I&apos;ve called &quot;Blair&quot;) as you suggested to<br/>me once.  Whatever you do, it&apos;s still orwell, but how you think of it<br/>will be different.</p><p>The point is that these systems (regular temperaments or regular<br/>mappings or temperament classes, whatever you call them) are<br/>discovered, not designed.

So do lots of other chord<br/>sequences, some ending on a seventh chord.  If you tested me, maybe<br/>I&apos;d show some preferences for G7 to resolve in the common practice way<br/>given a common practice or diatonic context.  It doesn&apos;t stop me<br/>following the music I wrote in other contexts . . . and doesn&apos;t seem<br/>to stop you understanding it either.</p><p>The rules of common practice are partly arbitrary and partly based in<br/>fundamental aspects of hearing.  The G7 to C is a good cadence because<br/>it involves stepwise resolutions, it&apos;s diatonic, and it ends on the<br/>major tonic.  There are other good cadences out there.  The<br/>expectation that a G7 should always resolve this way was an artifact<br/>of the common practice era and that&apos;s over now.  Some people, with<br/>either classical training or a large amount of exposure to common<br/>practice music, will hear it that way.  Most people won&apos;t.</p><p>The last two chords in the fragment I linked to make what sounds to me<br/>to be a strong, natural, resolved progression.  It&apos;s essentially Fh7<br/>to C (F harmonic seventh to C major).  The F itself is omitted, so you<br/>could call it other things, but it still means the tritone is<br/>resolving in the wrong direction.  In magic temperaments, that&apos;s<br/>likely to be the common direction because it&apos;s simpler on the spiral<br/>of thirds than Gh7 to C.</p><p>If anybody wants to re-use this cadence (I claim no copyright over it)<br/>note that it can be written over a common root as 6:10:12:14:18<br/>resolving to 6:9:12:15:18.  There&apos;s no need to temper it but certain<br/>steps become equalized in Magic.</p><p>&gt;&gt; A lot of us<br/>&gt;&gt; are attuned to the liberal use of seventh chords in rock<br/>&gt;&gt; and blues. &nbsp;They have a spicy feel and can you can use one<br/>&gt;&gt; as the tonic. &nbsp;I don&apos;t find a 4:5:6:7 has the same feel at<br/>&gt;&gt; all so I don&apos;t think it&apos;s altering my perceptions, other<br/>&gt;&gt; than making be receptive to the use of the 7 as coloration.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Jon Catler would disagree with you, and so (I would suspect) harmonic entropy. &nbsp;The canonical line I&apos;ve always heard from people in the tuning community is 12-TET&apos;s dominant 7th chords are just out-of-tune septimal otonalities. &nbsp;I&apos;ll admit a reasonably-pure 4:5:6:7 lacks the spiciness of 12-TET, but Catler sure rocks them pretty hard in his own blues and it seems to work.</p><p>Saying that a dominant seventh is heard as an out of tune harmonic<br/>seventh is not the same as saying a harmonic seventh is heard as a<br/>dominant seventh.  I don&apos;t follow the latter because I don&apos;t hear the<br/>harmonic seventh requiring a dominant function.  Whether the former is<br/>true I don&apos;t know.  It&apos;s always struck me as an unfalsifiable<br/>hypothesis.  A 12-TET dominant seventh sounds like what it is and a<br/>4:5:6:7 sounds like what it is.  They certainly don&apos;t sound the same<br/>because the tempered chord is out of tune.</p><p>&gt;&gt; I don&apos;t know how strong the associations are for you. &nbsp;I<br/>&gt;&gt; have noticed that you don&apos;t focus on microtonal harmony.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; That&apos;s not entirely true. &nbsp;Just because I don&apos;t focus on integrating extended JI (or temperaments thereof) doesn&apos;t mean I don&apos;t focus on harmony. &nbsp;Quite the contrary, the coloration of different (and extreme) mistunings of standard 5-limit chords is pretty much an integral feature of my music.</p><p>What microtonal piece do you have with harmony in the foreground?  You<br/>may consider your chords to be integral, but they&apos;re usually in the<br/>background when microtonal.  I&apos;m suspicious about the pad sounds you<br/>use because they can have a high bandwidth that obscures the tuning.<br/>You also tend to put a bass line against a high melody, so that<br/>there&apos;s little interaction.</p><p>&gt;&gt; Your Map of an Internal Landscape (that&apos;s you, right?) is<br/>&gt;&gt; good microtonal music, but it doesn&apos;t have much harmony.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; It&apos;s got as much harmony as most music in the same genre, i.e. rock or pop. &nbsp;Almost every single track has at least triadic harmony happening, except for the tracks in 11, 23, and 28 (because at the time I was a bit more conservative with using wonky 3-limit approximations). &nbsp;But indeed I paid more attention to melodies and root movements, since that seemed like a better starting-place for exploration. &nbsp;Getting some basics down first seemed a more sensible move than trying to go whole-hog for extended otonalities (which I generally dislike, even when Just).</p><p>Specific tracks from Finity that seem to have prominent harmony: Seas<br/>of Glass; Ribbons and Bows; Anger, Hate, and the World Beyond.  I may<br/>be tricked by the distortion, but it sounds like the sound of the<br/>chords is your starting off point and they can be right up in the mix.<br/> Where have you done the same thing microtonally?  If you haven&apos;t, it<br/>suggests you prefer the chords in 12.  If you have, of course, I&apos;ll<br/>listen to it.  I don&apos;t follow everything and it isn&apos;t all correctly<br/>filed.</p><p>&gt; Gene&apos;s music gets its wow factor for me mainly because he&apos;s juggling so many notes, and George&apos;s I really haven&apos;t heard any of except for his 11-EDO piece (which was awesome). &nbsp;Your work reminds me a lot of Gene&apos;s, in that both have some really funky alien progressions that definitely require me to work against my &quot;programming&quot; (though I rarely succeed). &nbsp;To be frank, though, I think that bringing in totally unusual harmonies as well as very unusual and complex scales, and doing very intricate and complex things with these harmonies and scales, is an approach that it&apos;s a bit too ahead of its time for me. &nbsp;It&apos;s hard for me to make it through an entire piece by either of you because I feel like there&apos;s nothing for me to latch on to. &nbsp;Neither of you write particularly rhythmically-oriented music, either, so there isn&apos;t even that as a &quot;safety-net&quot;. &nbsp;But hey, to each his own. &nbsp;The both of you come from very different musical backgrounds than I do and have a very different set of goals. &nbsp;But anyway the point is that my &quot;lack of focus&quot; on extended harmony probably makes more sense if you take into account my background and the &quot;compositional problems&quot; I turned to microtonality to solve.</p><p>You don&apos;t think my music&apos;s rythmically-oriented??</p><p>You can have different goals if you like.  But you shouldn&apos;t then be<br/>saying the tools we&apos;re using to achieve our goals are inadequate.<br/>We&apos;re getting what we want by focusing on low error temperaments.  I<br/>don&apos;t hear anybody getting the same results any other way.  You say<br/>you and others make good music with other tunings, and that&apos;s correct.<br/> (It sounds fine to me.)  But I say you aren&apos;t getting good harmony.</p><p>There&apos;s plenty of music to be made that ignores or sidelines the<br/>harmony, but some of us want good harmony, and that&apos;s why we moved<br/>into microtonality.  When it comes to extending the harmony, you need<br/>tend to imply new and complex scales.  I&apos;m fine with that if the two<br/>are well integrated.  The fact you can accept my resolutions means you<br/>can&apos;t be hearing things much different to me.</p><p>&gt;&gt; And then you say you don&apos;t see the point of<br/>&gt;&gt; close approximations to simple ratios, that they don&apos;t have<br/>&gt;&gt; musical value for you. So, fine, if it doesn&apos;t work for<br/>&gt;&gt; you, try something that does.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I don&apos;t recall saying anything quite so drastic, but it&apos;s true that accuracy is pretty far down my list of priorities. &nbsp;Mostly because it seems to take care of itself well enough, insofar as no scale is completely devoid of some form of consonance.</p><p>Right, you&apos;ll get some form of consonance, but if you want really good<br/>chords you have to go out and look for them.</p><p>                      Graham</p></div><h3><a id=98113 href="#98113">ðŸ”—</a>Carl Lumma &#x3C;carl@...&#x3E;</h3><span>4/17/2011 3:10:09 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>I wrote:</p><p>&gt;&gt; So if someone wants to show me an &quot;all septimal otonal or<br/>&gt;&gt; utonal tetrad&quot; progression that makes me go &quot;ah&quot; the way a<br/>&gt;&gt; basic I-vi-ii-V-I progression does, I&apos;ll eat my words.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Without passing go or collecting $200, you can swap the<br/>&gt; triads in that cadence for o- and u-tonal tetrads and you<br/>&gt; should have your meal.</p><p>Here&apos;s one rendition.

You are one of the only<br/>people who is actually using the math to find and generate scales that<br/>suit your needs, and for your needs you don&apos;t mind composing in<br/>46-equal or using really large MOS&apos;s.</p><p>I, on the other hand, am trying to find &quot;tonal&quot; sounding scales that<br/>sound completely different. I&apos;d like for them to fit into a compact<br/>size, similar to that of meantone[7] or blackwood[10], and I&apos;d like<br/>for them to sound completely different than anything I&apos;ve ever heard<br/>before. Pajara might be such a scale, and if Paul had figured it out<br/>in the 1800&apos;s before dominant 7 chords were being used as tonal<br/>sonorities, it would have blown everyone&apos;s mine. But he didn&apos;t, he<br/>figured it out today, and so it doesn&apos;t sound that &quot;xenharmonic&quot; to<br/>me.</p><p>Maybe part of it is that if you&apos;re dealing with 13-limit heptads, then<br/>it&apos;s just hard to find a 7-10 note scale that fits a lot in it. I&apos;ve<br/>been trying to work with subgroups involving only three primes, like<br/>2.7.11, to find a temperament with a complexity rivaling that of<br/>meantone. Machine is the obvious winner here. Since having no-3&apos;s<br/>might be kind of rough, I&apos;m also trying to check out <a href="http://2.3.7.11">2.3.7.11</a>, which<br/>might lead to some xenharmonic 10-note scales if we can get 3 tetrads<br/>that share a common 3/2. Finally, I note that with more complex 12-tet<br/>music, like Great American Songbook stuff or stuff by Gershwin, or<br/>even the blues - where they do tend to use something like 4:5:6:7 as a<br/>base harmony - they often stick to a meantone &quot;understructure,&quot; but<br/>just add 7 (or 9, or the #11, or the b9 and #9 which are really close<br/>to ratios of 17 and 19) as they will. Maybe this lends itself to<br/>thinking away in rank 3 or higher - rank 2 (meantone) understructure,<br/>addition of no-13&apos;s 19-limit harmonics on top to enrich that<br/>structure.</p><p>For 40s American pop standards, they will change the scales that<br/>they&apos;re using over every single chord, so maybe it really is rank 2,<br/>but where the chords don&apos;t derive from the base scale - just (most of)<br/>the melody. Then again, with the blues, people tend to sing in a 5-7<br/>note scale (that isn&apos;t even proper) over the ENTIRE chord progression<br/>of a 12-bar blues, so perhaps it&apos;s worth it for us to find &quot;melodic<br/>subsets&quot; of these larger scales, and then still just use them<br/>directly. Or maybe we just need to get more into the MODMOS&apos;s of each<br/>scale, or maybe I just need to move on with the omnitetrachordal stuff<br/>(like defining it to your satisfaction). But either way, nobody&apos;s<br/>talking about deep sixing anything, we&apos;re just trying to find better<br/>ways to use the math to predict useful scales.</p><p>I continually bring up the above examples because they represent very<br/>real ways that we think and have thought about music for over 100<br/>years now, but these truths are generally not well represented in<br/>academia and so many don&apos;t know them. I have some insight into this<br/>because I was fortunate enough to have excellent jazz teachers in<br/>college - but &quot;jazz&quot; and all that entails isn&apos;t the point here. Many<br/>of these concepts were pioneered by folks like Debussy, Stravinsky,<br/>Gershwin, folks like Cole Porter, etc. The bigger picture has nothing<br/>to do with the stylistic inklings of &quot;jazz&quot; (which I&apos;m not always a<br/>fan of), but that there&apos;s a story being told of higher-limit<br/>harmonies, 3D/4D structures on top of rank 2 substructures, use of<br/>&quot;modal&quot; (MODMOS) harmonies, ascalar tonality, etc.</p><p>The truth is that academia&apos;s take on &quot;jazz&quot; is even worse than its<br/>take on microtonality, so I want to try and at least set the record<br/>straight on a list like this where people are down to figure out what<br/>is really going on. All of my contributions on the MODMOS topic so far<br/>are my attempt to generalize modal harmony concepts that I learned at<br/>school to xenharmonic scales, so so far it seems to be working. Maybe<br/>by developing melodic subsets of larger scales (the blues), or coming<br/>up with a rank-2 &quot;skeleton&quot; while enriching it with higher-limit<br/>chords (Gershwin, the whole sound of the 40s, etc), or working out<br/>some &quot;tonal&quot; sounding omnitetrachordal scales to find useful MODMOS&apos;s<br/>(which I haven&apos;t defined satisfactorily yet), we&apos;ll make some huge<br/>progress into coming up with cognitively coherent scales that are<br/>packed with higher-limit harmony. Anyway, now I&apos;m the guy who&apos;s<br/>ranting. But none of these developments have anything to do with<br/>deep-sixing anything.</p><p>&gt; Before I ever heard a note of either 19 or 22, I expected them to sound familiar in certain ways--19 because it shared 81/80 with 12, and 22 because it shared 64/63. And I was not disappointed. In those days, that did not prevent them from sounding, to my ears which had never heard such things, new and exciting. I worked with 19, with 22, and with 7-limit JI and to me it was a new world. Perhaps we are a little jaded.</p><p>They are new and exciting, but it is my particular artistic goal to<br/>find something that, to the average person, sounds completely<br/>different and fresh, makes &quot;sense&quot; in some kind of strange way, but<br/>they don&apos;t know why -- yet they can immediately comprehend it. I don&apos;t<br/>want to overwhelm and blast them with novelty that they can&apos;t<br/>comprehend, and I don&apos;t want to show them something that just sounds<br/>like a more &quot;in-tune&quot; version of what they already know (Pajara in<br/>22-tet). Personally, I don&apos;t want to have to deal with really<br/>high-error temperaments either, because while I&apos;m getting used to<br/>them, it would be nice to be able to pile on the harmony. So that&apos;s my<br/>goal. Some parts of 22 have fit into this (porcupine), some have not<br/>(Pajara).</p><p>&gt; As for the linear temperaments of fairly low complexity I&apos;ve been discussing, 12 shares 99/98, 176/175 and 225/224 with orwell; 126/125 with myna and sensi; 100/99 and 225/224 with magic.

What do you mean?</p><p>&gt; &gt; In many cases, 5-limit systems with &quot;new puns&quot; will sound more xenharmonic than 7-limit systems forming proper MOS&apos;s at 12, at least to me. Perhaps you hear it differently. But I&apos;d be surprised if you disagree.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Except Igs is dismissing all these temperaments I mentioned above which don&apos;t form proper MOS at 12.</p><p>Because for many of these temperaments, the MOS&apos;s by themselves don&apos;t<br/>do much.

Meantone would still be meantone, but<br/>&gt; how you thought of it would be different.  This is an important point.</p><p>I don&apos;t think looking at 5-limit meantone vs 7-limit meantone is necessarily a good analogy.  It&apos;s pretty hard to find a good tuning of 5-limit meantone that, when extended a bit beyond 7 notes, has excellent tunings of the 7-limit.  In the case of 23-EDO as &quot;Myna&quot;, it&apos;s a good tuning of the subgroup that never reaches a good tuning of the full 7-limit.</p><p>&gt; Magic is ideal in the 9-limit but also works in the 11-limit.  You<br/>&gt; don&apos;t need full pentads for the 9-limit harmony to shine through --<br/>&gt; you can mix 5-limit chords with &quot;sus4&quot; and 6:7:9 approximations.  If<br/>&gt; you add more notes to get those 9-limit pentads, what you have will<br/>&gt; still be magic, but how you think of it will be different.  You can<br/>&gt; also note that some dissonances have 11-limit rationalizations.</p><p>The question that Paul always put to me was whether rationalized intervals had psychoacoustic justifications.  I&apos;m agnostic about whether a naked 11-limit ratio has any psychoacoustic identity, but possibly Paul (and definitely Carl) seemed pretty convinced that they don&apos;t.  So the question of whether or not Magic &quot;works&quot; in the 11-limit is a question of whether it produces 11-limit harmonies that are psychoacoustically valid.</p><p>&gt; Orwell was first noted (that I&apos;m aware of) in the 11-limit.  You may<br/>&gt; approach it as a 7-limit temperament, but note that the dissonances<br/>&gt; have 11-limit rationalizations.  You&apos;re bound to hit those dissonances<br/>&gt; because they&apos;re some of the simplest intervals.  You may treat it as a<br/>&gt; small scale with incomplete 11-limit harmony from the start.  Or you<br/>&gt; may treat it as a system for allowing puns in full 11-limit harmony<br/>&gt; without looking at scales.  You can even start with 13-limit subgroups<br/>&gt; (that may entail the variant I&apos;ve called &quot;Blair&quot;) as you suggested to<br/>&gt; me once.  Whatever you do, it&apos;s still orwell, but how you think of it<br/>&gt; will be different.</p><p>But what &quot;makes it&quot; Orwell?  Commas?  Again, in the case of Orwell, if you treat it as a 2.7/6.11/8 subgroup, then 13-EDO is an Orwell temperament, while if you treat it as a 7-limit temperament, 13-EDO is NOT an Orwell temperament.  Paul has been insistent about the latter for years now, and if you think 13-EDO is an Orwell temperament, you might try taking it up with him.</p><p>&gt; The point is that these systems (regular temperaments or regular<br/>&gt; mappings or temperament classes, whatever you call them) are<br/>&gt; discovered, not designed.  It doesn&apos;t matter what the first person to<br/>&gt; discover them had in mind.</p><p>And yet, it comes down to psychoacoustic considerations to tell us where one temperament ends and another begins.  What&apos;s the difference between Dimisept and Dimipent, or Negrisept and Negripent?  They&apos;re treated as different temperaments while Meantone[5-limit] and Meantone[7-limit], you seem to be saying, are not.  Or if they are different temperaments, then your earlier analogy is invalid.</p><p>-Igs</p></div><h3><a id=98130 href="#98130">ðŸ”—</a>genewardsmith &#x3C;genewardsmith@...&#x3E;</h3><span>4/17/2011 9:16:59 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;cityoftheasleep&quot; &lt;igliashon@...&gt; wrote:</p><p>&gt; The first two chords sounded really cool, but I would be lying if I said the resolution felt finished.

But<br/>&gt; that doesn&apos;t mean it sounds more consonant than an otonal tetrad,<br/>&gt; which it certainly does not.</p><p>Well, I was trying to relate back to what Michael said, which sounded like he was talking about how the dyad sounded, or possibly how it sounded when tacked onto a major chord. It didn&apos;t sound like he was specifically talking about how it worked in a chord progression.</p><p>What I think you&apos;re saying is that adding the 7 into a 4:5:6 chord to make 4:5:6:7 is an independent harmonic change, whereas sticking an F into a G chord in the key of C adds to the sense of tonal resolution in a V-I progression, regardless of whether you&apos;re in 12 equal or JI or something in between. If I have you right, then I accept that these are two different things. If Michael was talking about functional harmony, then my Tenney Height argument is irrelevant.</p><p>That leaves unresolved in my mind the question of whether people will hear the 7 in 4:5:6:7 as &quot;close enough&quot; to 1000 cents for it to function as a dominant 7th anyway -- even though it&apos;s obviously not simply an F. As Carl says, &quot;Concordance will influence which chords are chosen for which roles in a functional style, but other things are involved too.&quot; So unless other arguments are brought to bear, the possibility still seems open that conditioning might lead people to hear the harmonic 7th (harmonically) as a dominant 7th (functionally), which seemed to be Igs&apos;s point. But that&apos;s just a possibility, not something I&apos;m hanging my hat on.</p><p>Carl:<br/>&gt; The roots [of 12-tET] were historical, but that history is one of<br/>&gt; the development of a style of 5-limit harmony.  It&apos;s the story of<br/>&gt; the journey from meantone temperament, which tempers out 81/80<br/>&gt; only, to 12-ET, which additionally tempers out 128/125 and<br/>&gt; 648/625.  This was understood by theorists here and there, but<br/>&gt; mostly it happened organically.  Only in the last several decades<br/>&gt; have theorists put it all together and made predictions about<br/>&gt; alternative ways the history might have gone -- tuning forks in<br/>&gt; the road, as it were.</p><p>But that&apos;s part of my point: It happened organically, such that piano tuners were trained to tune a fifth perfectly and then make it flat &quot;just a little bit, about two beats per second, to avoid getting a wolf fifth&quot; or some such stuff. That&apos;s a human and practical method, not a prime-limit-related one. It can be described with prime limits and commas, and some people even knew the math involved, and it led to great 3-limit and acceptable 5-limit harmony -- but it sure doesn&apos;t look like they were focused on getting 19-limit harmony. So, even though we *can* retrofit 19-limit harmony onto it, why *should* we? For historical purposes, I just don&apos;t see why that would be relevant. When talking about current conditioning, I&apos;m also not sure why it would make sense to talk about prime limits, when that&apos;s not the way most people use the scale.</p><p>On the other hand, it&apos;s reasonable to talk about it for 19-limit harmony *now*, for new compositions. Now we can approach the scale as 12-EDO rather than as 12-tET, and use it just as we would any other EDO.</p><p>Me:<br/>&gt; &gt; When I pick a non-12 piece -- whether it&apos;s common-practice<br/>&gt; &gt; music from before the dominance of 12 EDO or one of my own<br/>&gt; &gt; attempts at composing outside of 12 EDO -- and render it<br/>&gt; &gt; with 12 EDO, it never sounds out of tune. Ugly, boring,<br/>&gt; &gt; inelegant, sure, but not &quot;out of tune&quot;.</p><p>Carl:<br/>&gt; Hm.  To me, this<br/>&gt; <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHjitZIyaRc">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHjitZIyaRc</a><br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; sounds like an out of tune version of this<br/>&gt; <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EHExcd6PYxQ">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EHExcd6PYxQ</a><br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; And I can&apos;t hear it any other way.</p><p>That&apos;s interesting. The meantone version sounds a little richer, maybe, but the 12-tET version doesn&apos;t sound out of tune. How can the 12-tET version be &quot;in tune&quot; and the meantone one be &quot;more in tune&quot;? But that&apos;s the way I hear it.</p><p>That said, my ear is no doubt a lot less well-trained than yours.</p><p>It&apos;s a very nice piece, by the way, and one that I&apos;ve never heard before.

Since you can do things in 31-EDO and 22-EDO that you can&apos;t do in 13, like play 4:5:6:7:9:11 hexads that actually sound like 4:5:6:7:9:11 hexads, 13 is not an Orwell temperament.

In that case, 13-EDO and 23-EDO both lack intervals that sound reasonably like 7/1 or 3/1, so the Orwell and Myna mappings (respectively) when applied to those tunings are out of bounds.  But you are saying that as long as some of the intervals retain their character--13-EDO still retains a good 7/3 and 11/1, 23-EDO still retains a good 5/3 and 7/3--then the temperament still applies.

That&apos;s different to a consensus on<br/>the rules for choosing them.</p><p>&gt;&gt; You&apos;d probably want to define 13-EDO in a 13-limit subgroup, in which<br/>&gt;&gt; case it would probably be Winston or Blair, in which case the same<br/>&gt;&gt; name would likely cascade to the 11-limit subgroup, but that wouldn&apos;t<br/>&gt;&gt; stop it being Orwell as well. &nbsp;Certain properties, like the mapping of<br/>&gt;&gt; some chords and the pattern of large/small steps, will be consistent,<br/>&gt;&gt; and you should have a way of saying so.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; That was more or less my argument to Paul as to why I though 13-EDO should be considered an Orwell temperament. &nbsp;His disagreement amounted to insisting that anything you can do in one Orwell temperament you should be able to do in another, at least insofar as the 11-limit is concerned. &nbsp;Since you can do things in 31-EDO and 22-EDO that you can&apos;t do in 13, like play 4:5:6:7:9:11 hexads that actually sound like 4:5:6:7:9:11 hexads, 13 is not an Orwell temperament. &nbsp;I&apos;m not saying I agree, but that was his argument.</p><p>In so far as the 11-limit is concerned, what you have is 11-limit<br/>Orwell.  An 11-limit subgroup temperament wouldn&apos;t be 11-limit Orwell.<br/> Paul was happy with a 7-limit temperament being Orwell, but not the<br/>5-limit.</p><p>&gt; Paul insists that the range of a temperament, if it is to be defined, should be defined psychoacoustically, i.e. the boundaries will be wherever the tuning stops producing intervals that sound reasonably like what the mapping says they should sound like. &nbsp;In that case, 13-EDO and 23-EDO both lack intervals that sound reasonably like 7/1 or 3/1, so the Orwell and Myna mappings (respectively) when applied to those tunings are out of bounds. &nbsp;But you are saying that as long as some of the intervals retain their character--13-EDO still retains a good 7/3 and 11/1, 23-EDO still retains a good 5/3 and 7/3--then the temperament still applies. &nbsp;This contradicts Paul&apos;s view.</p><p>That&apos;s immediately a problem in that we don&apos;t know or agree on where<br/>the boundaries should be drawn.  But, even being liberal, will the<br/>boundaries ever be identical in different limits?  Does anybody think<br/>they are for 5- and 7-limit meantones?  I&apos;d expect the boundaries to<br/>be narrower in higher limits.</p><p>I&apos;m suggesting that only the intervals (or suitably simple intervals<br/>for open-ended limits) in the subgroup you&apos;re explicitly looking at<br/>should retain their character.  If you were thinking of other<br/>intervals you should have defined the subgroup accordingly.</p><p>&gt; I would&apos;ve hoped for a more rigorous approach in establishing conventions, but given that my interest in this sort of thing is academic at best, I can&apos;t really complain. &nbsp;If it&apos;s working for you, more power to you.</p><p>A rigorous approach gave us Pontiac over Garibaldi as the Schismatic<br/>extension.  I don&apos;t know who&apos;s using Pontiac.  I thought it was too<br/>complex to worry about.  Of course, we disagreed on that.  But any<br/>strict rule is bound to give cases you disagree with.  I&apos;d rather<br/>choose the names that seem to make sense.  If history proves me wrong,<br/>that&apos;s not such a big deal.</p><p>Also, there are cases where a higher-limit name is already taken.<br/>Like I decided a certain 13-limit planar temperament should be called<br/>&quot;Tripod&quot; because it fit with tripod notation.  That left a certain<br/>other extension as the default Marvel (unless somebody else had<br/>already made that decision).  If the rigorous approach had told us<br/>that Tripod should have been a synonym for Marvel, what would have<br/>been the point?  We&apos;d have one more name to think of for Marvel<br/>extensions.</p><p>My interest now is mostly in having some friendly names coming out of<br/>the searches instead of lists of numbers (now with warts).  As the<br/>same list of numbers is given on the right anyway, new names can&apos;t be<br/>worse than useless.  Using a familiar name in an unfamiliar limit can<br/>be useful.  If you see a list of temperaments in an unfamiliar<br/>subgroup, but some of them have names you&apos;re familiar with in the full<br/>prime-limit, that should give you a good idea of what those<br/>temperaments are going to behave like.  You can still check the<br/>tunings.</p><p>I&apos;d also like to check the explosion of names.  My database (stored as<br/>a Python dictionary) can handle a large number of mappings.  As a<br/>human being I find it confusing to deal with a lot of different names.<br/> We already have well over 300 and going through all the subgroups<br/>could potentially give us thousands.  I try to be as unoriginal as<br/>possible, like with legal precedent.</p><p>                     Graham</p></div><h3><a id=98176 href="#98176">ðŸ”—</a>Michael &#x3C;djtrancendance@...&#x3E;</h3><span>4/18/2011 6:37:00 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Igs&gt;&quot;Tried it, and nope.

I certainly don&apos;t think MOS always leads to &quot;good&quot; scales, and that non-MOS always don&apos;t.  In any given EDO within the &quot;practical on guitar&quot; range, I only expect maybe to find maybe 2 to 6 decent MOS scales, and that&apos;s usually how it goes.  The only reason I favor MOS scales is because I find them easier to understand structurally--which is also why I favor EDOs.  And I have found some very good MOS scales that don&apos;t feel wonky at all; if I hadn&apos;t, I would have given up the approach long ago.</p><p>Also, the way I function as a composer sort of requires that my musical elements are laid out for me beforehand; I don&apos;t know how to just pick a set of pitches to work with ex nihilo.  I&apos;m a horribly indecisive person, and the more choices I have open to me, the more impossible I find it to choose from them.  Limiting myself to MOS scales within EDOs narrows the field to a manageable size for me.  The &quot;gems&quot; are more apparent that way.</p><p>Often times, if I find a particular chord I like in an EDO, there&apos;s going to be an MOS that gives me plenty of that chord within a natural-sounding tonal framework.  Let me give some examples:</p><p>11-EDO: I like the 0-4-9 triad, or 0-2-4 in inversion, and the 6L+1s MOS scale gives a ton of &apos;em, all neatly chained together.</p><p>13-EDO: I love the 0-2-5 and 0-3-5 triads, which can be expanded into consonant pentads in various ways (0-2-5-7-10, 0-3-5-8-10, 0-2-5-8-10, 0-3-5-7-10), and lo and behold the 5L+3s scale is great for these chords.</p><p>15-EDO: the 5L+5s scale is probably my favorite scale ever, because every degree forms either a 0-5-9 or 0-4-9 triad, and all the 0-5-9 triads expand to both 0-5-9-12 and 0-5-9-14 tetrads, which I love also.  More importantly, you can move up or down from any triad by a 720-cent interval, and you can use leading-tone resolutions to any of the 0-5-9 triads.  In essence, all of the &quot;major triads&quot; can function as tonics *or* &quot;dominants&quot;, and that&apos;s just really fucking cool to me.  I haven&apos;t exploited this in composition yet, but I definitely plan to in the future.</p><p>16-EDO: My three favorite tetrads are 0-5-13-19, 0-5-13-18, and 0-6-14-19, and whaddaya know, the 4L+2s scale has two of each of them!</p><p>18-EDO: 0-5-9 and 0-4-9 both pretty solidly approximate 5:6:7 and 1/(5:6:7), and the 2L+6s scale has four of each, one on each root.  It also has a slightly improper version of the 5L+3s scale from 13-EDO with harmonies that sound even smoother and work pretty much the same way as they do in 13.</p><p>23-EDO: there&apos;s just too much to list here, really.  23 is so full of good MOS scales it makes me want to pee myself.</p><p>I haven&apos;t found any of these scales sound &quot;wonky&quot; in the slightest, since they&apos;re all proper, and the chords are all pretty evenly spaced out over the scale.</p><p>I&apos;m sure there are other approaches I&apos;m overlooking in these EDOs that would lead to some great music, but I&apos;m pretty well satisfied with what I&apos;ve found in the MOS approach.  And of course there&apos;s also the MODMOS&apos;s, which I haven&apos;t even begun to look at but Mike and Gene seem pretty confident there&apos;s lots of untapped potential in that direction.  Maybe if they come up with some good-looking ones I&apos;ll check it out.</p><p>-Igs</p></div><h3><a id=98219 href="#98219">ðŸ”—</a>cityoftheasleep &#x3C;igliashon@...&#x3E;</h3><span>4/19/2011 1:15:13 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, Michael &lt;djtrancendance@...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt; &nbsp; But, on any theoretical level, I think the only consistent thing you gravitate to is strictly<br/>&gt; proper scales...</p><p>Now that is patently false.

It&apos;s the<br/>&gt;&gt; story of the journey from meantone temperament, which tempers<br/>&gt;&gt; out 81/80 only, to 12-ET, which additionally tempers out<br/>&gt;&gt; 128/125 and 648/625.  This was understood by theorists here<br/>&gt;&gt; and there, but mostly it happened organically.  Only in the<br/>&gt;&gt; last several decades have theorists put it all together and<br/>&gt;&gt; made predictions about alternative ways the history might<br/>&gt;&gt; have gone -- tuning forks in the road, as it were.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; But that&apos;s part of my point: It happened organically, such that<br/>&gt; piano tuners were trained to tune a fifth perfectly and then<br/>&gt; make it flat &quot;just a little bit, about two beats per second, to<br/>&gt; avoid getting a wolf fifth&quot; or some such stuff. That&apos;s a human<br/>&gt; and practical method, not a prime-limit-related one. It can be<br/>&gt; described with prime limits and commas, and some people even<br/>&gt; knew the math involved, and it led to great 3-limit and<br/>&gt; acceptable 5-limit harmony -- but it sure doesn&apos;t look like<br/>&gt; they were focused on getting 19-limit harmony. So, even though<br/>&gt; we *can* retrofit 19-limit harmony onto it, why *should* we?</p><p>I don&apos;t know who mentioned 19-limit harmony.  It&apos;s possible<br/>to build completely new and different but still &quot;functional&quot;<br/>styles in the 5-limit.  Take porcupine (named after a piece<br/>by Herman).  It tempers out 250/243 instead of 81/80 and is<br/>associated with a whole sequence of scales different from those<br/>of meantone/12-ET.  There are a variety of these 5-limit<br/>systems, and even more of them by the time we get to the<br/>19-limit.  In no case are we bolting anything on to existing<br/>music theory.  Well, it&apos;s possible to extend the chords of the<br/>diatonic scale -- as I did in the chord progression I posted<br/>for Igs.  That in itself is a fertile direction some<br/>microtonalists have tried.  But no, the men of tuning-math<br/>are after tougher stuff.</p><p>&gt; For historical purposes, I just don&apos;t see why that would be<br/>&gt; relevant. When talking about current conditioning, I&apos;m also not<br/>&gt; sure why it would make sense to talk about prime limits, when<br/>&gt; that&apos;s not the way most people use the scale.</p><p>12-ET is usually used in a 5-limit manner.  Sometimes in<br/>a 7-limit one.  Beyond that its approximations start to<br/>break down, but interesting suspensions can be made<br/>(e.g. &quot;quartal harmony&quot;).</p><p>&gt;&gt; Hm.

The reason I stick mostly to MOS these days is because I hate juggling many sizes of interval per interval class.  I have a hard enough time on guitar memorizing which root has which harmonies when I only have two sizes of each class to memorize.  Non-MOS scales make it that much harder.  Of course, this isn&apos;t much of a problem in the low EDOs from 11 to about 17, where I can generally keep my bearings even playing fully chromatically.  19 seems to stay okay too, probably just because I can super-impose a 12-TET grid on it in my head and see the new notes as colorations of the old, but 18 and from 20 up, the simplest patterns on the fretboard tend to be MOS (though not all MOS are simple).</p><p>When I&apos;m playing keyboard, it doesn&apos;t matter at all whether a scale is MOS or not.  You can throw any old 12-note scale at me and I&apos;ll be able to deal with it just fine, whether it&apos;s proper or MOS or not.  Thing is, I&apos;m not a very good keyboardist and I&apos;m most interested in what I can put on a guitar.  So all of my thinking about &quot;what&apos;s good&quot; and &quot;what works&quot; is inherently tied to my limitations as a player on my particular instrument.

One of the things that keeps me so involved in making and sharing music is the fact that people seem to like it.</p><p>In fact, one of the main inspirations that got me back into making microtonal music was the fact that at the time (early 2009) my one micro album (at the time, &quot;Map of an Internal Landscape&quot;) was getting drastically more plays than any of my other albums (according to <a href="http://last.fm">last.fm</a>) and was also getting me a lot more attention.  It occurred to me that if I wanted to make music that wasn&apos;t just going to get lost in the airwaves, making more micro stuff was a good bet.  Sure, the audience may be small, but it&apos;s bigger than the audience for all of my 12-TET stuff combined, despite the fact that I think the artistic quality of my 12-TET stuff far exceeds that of my micro stuff (so far).  I&apos;m not necessarily trying to please the microtonal community, but if people here weren&apos;t so generally receptive to my stuff, I&apos;d probably have just stuck with 12-TET for simplicity&apos;s sake.  As it is, writing microtonal music that people like makes me feel at least a little bit important in the grand scheme of things, and that makes a big difference to me.  Hopefully I&apos;ll eventually get to a point where I&apos;m writing stuff that the non-micro community enjoys.

It occurred to me that if I wanted to make music that wasn&apos;t just going to get lost in the airwaves, making more micro stuff was a good bet. Sure, the audience may be small, but it&apos;s bigger than the audience for all of my 12-TET stuff combined, despite the fact that I think the artistic quality of my 12-TET stuff far exceeds that of my micro stuff (so far). I&apos;m not necessarily trying to please the microtonal community, but if people here weren&apos;t so generally receptive to my stuff, I&apos;d probably have just stuck with 12-TET for simplicity&apos;s sake. As it is, writing microtonal music that people like makes me feel at least a little bit important in the grand scheme of things, and that makes a big difference to me. Hopefully I&apos;ll eventually get to a point where I&apos;m writing stuff that the non-micro community enjoys.

To the contrary, I&apos;ve<br/>&gt; &gt; found in my own  experience that harmonic movement in such tunings, if it wishes to<br/>&gt; &gt; avoid a &quot;wonky&quot; sound, requires lumps and gaps that don&apos;t fit the regularity of step sizes &gt; which is created by moments of symmetry.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I do agree that there is nothing magical about MOS&apos;s, and in fact I do think the vast majority of MOS scales out there are not worth a damn.  I certainly don&apos;t think MOS always leads to &quot;good&quot; scales, and that non-MOS always don&apos;t.  In any given EDO within the &quot;practical on guitar&quot; range, I only expect maybe to find maybe 2 to 6 decent MOS scales, and that&apos;s usually how it goes.  The only reason I favor MOS scales is because I find them easier to understand structurally--which is also why I favor EDOs.  And I have found some very good MOS scales that don&apos;t feel wonky at all; if I hadn&apos;t, I would have given up the approach long ago.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Also, the way I function as a composer sort of requires that my musical elements are laid out for me beforehand; I don&apos;t know how to just pick a set of pitches to work with ex nihilo.  I&apos;m a horribly indecisive person, and the more choices I have open to me, the more impossible I find it to choose from them.  Limiting myself to MOS scales within EDOs narrows the field to a manageable size for me.  The &quot;gems&quot; are more apparent that way.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Often times, if I find a particular chord I like in an EDO, there&apos;s going to be an MOS that gives me plenty of that chord within a natural-sounding tonal framework.  Let me give some examples:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; 11-EDO: I like the 0-4-9 triad, or 0-2-4 in inversion, and the 6L+1s MOS scale gives a ton of &apos;em, all neatly chained together.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; 13-EDO: I love the 0-2-5 and 0-3-5 triads, which can be expanded into consonant pentads in various ways (0-2-5-7-10, 0-3-5-8-10, 0-2-5-8-10, 0-3-5-7-10), and lo and behold the 5L+3s scale is great for these chords.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; 15-EDO: the 5L+5s scale is probably my favorite scale ever, because every degree forms either a 0-5-9 or 0-4-9 triad, and all the 0-5-9 triads expand to both 0-5-9-12 and 0-5-9-14 tetrads, which I love also.  More importantly, you can move up or down from any triad by a 720-cent interval, and you can use leading-tone resolutions to any of the 0-5-9 triads.  In essence, all of the &quot;major triads&quot; can function as tonics *or* &quot;dominants&quot;, and that&apos;s just really fucking cool to me.  I haven&apos;t exploited this in composition yet, but I definitely plan to in the future.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; 16-EDO: My three favorite tetrads are 0-5-13-19, 0-5-13-18, and 0-6-14-19, and whaddaya know, the 4L+2s scale has two of each of them!<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; 18-EDO: 0-5-9 and 0-4-9 both pretty solidly approximate 5:6:7 and 1/(5:6:7), and the 2L+6s scale has four of each, one on each root.  It also has a slightly improper version of the 5L+3s scale from 13-EDO with harmonies that sound even smoother and work pretty much the same way as they do in 13.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; 23-EDO: there&apos;s just too much to list here, really.  23 is so full of good MOS scales it makes me want to pee myself.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I haven&apos;t found any of these scales sound &quot;wonky&quot; in the slightest, since they&apos;re all proper, and the chords are all pretty evenly spaced out over the scale.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I&apos;m sure there are other approaches I&apos;m overlooking in these EDOs that would lead to some great music, but I&apos;m pretty well satisfied with what I&apos;ve found in the MOS approach.  And of course there&apos;s also the MODMOS&apos;s, which I haven&apos;t even begun to look at but Mike and Gene seem pretty confident there&apos;s lots of untapped potential in that direction.  Maybe if they come up with some good-looking ones I&apos;ll check it out.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; -Igs<br/>&gt;</p></div><h3><a id=98269 href="#98269">ðŸ”—</a>lobawad &#x3C;lobawad@...&#x3E;</h3><span>4/20/2011 8:18:16 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Returning to the original topic of &quot;resolution&quot;, and apropos what Igliashon is doing with &quot;xenharmonic&quot; tunings, and some aspects of &quot;tuning theory&quot; in general, here&apos;s a little ditty.

Melodies, to me, carry more &quot;mood&quot; information than chord progressions, and chords are really only important to support and/or enhance the melody.  Whether one tuning has &quot;more&quot; happy or angry or sad chords than another is irrelevant, all that matters is that there are &quot;enough&quot;.

Most of the scales I like for melody in 13 and 11 have the semitones spaced out pretty well; in 11, my &quot;default&quot; scale is 2 2 2 2 2 1, and in 13 it&apos;s either 2 2 2 2 2 2 1 or 2 1 2 2 1 2 2 1.</p><p>If you want to play some numerical rationalization games, in 13-EDO 0-2-4-6 more or less approximates 8:9:10:11, and 0-4-5-7-9 approximates 13:16:17:19:21 pretty well, which might or might not be numerology but the point is consecutive whole-tones with a semitone thrown in the mix in 13-EDO sounds just fine to me.  In 11-EDO, 0-2-4-7 approximates 7:8:9:11, 0-2-3 solidly approximates 14:16:17, and 0-5-6-8 loosely approximates 11:15:16:18, so again, there&apos;s some loose rational justification for stacks of whole-tones and semitones in 11-EDO, too.</p><p>&gt; &nbsp; That&apos;s impressive...I certainly find 11-EDO more confining.&nbsp; Sure I can do plenty of<br/>&gt; melodic variations with it...more than enough...but I constantly find myself running up<br/>&gt; against the sustained/&quot;neighboring tone&quot; issue.</p><p>You just have to get used to the idea that good chords in 11 work differently than in 12.  0-4-7 in 11-EDO is a great 7:9:11 triad, which is concordant but feels very different than the &quot;4:5:6&quot; that that same step-pattern makes in 12.  0-3-7 is the utonal version, i.e. 1/(7:9:11), or maybe it&apos;s a 9:11:14 chord, which is just the octave inversion of 7:9:11.  Hard to say.  The important thing is, concordance aside, neither of them is a &quot;happy&quot; chord, so you have to use them differently.  On the other hand, the 0-2-4 7:8:9 triad is plenty happy.  11-EDO also has a cool 8:11:15 triad of 0-5-10, which is also pretty concordant but not &quot;happy&quot;; make it 0-4-10 and you&apos;re looking at a scrunched-up 7:9:13 that sounds a bit happier but still pretty tense.  At 0-3-10, it&apos;s basically a 9:11:17 with a few teeth missing, not so nice, but drop it down to 0-2-10, and hey, that&apos;s a not-half-bad 8:9:15, which sounds pretty sweet and mellow and is one of the few (if not the only) 5-limit chords you can make in 11.  Of course I don&apos;t think these rationalizations are actually important in 11, I&apos;ve been using these chords for years and this is the first time I&apos;ve sat down to figure out where they stand in relation to JI, but in point of fact 11-EDO does pretty darn well as a <a href="http://2.7.9.11">2.7.9.11</a> subgroup.

I&apos;m starting to really like it because of the<br/><a href="http://2.7.9.11">2.7.9.11</a> subgroup stuff, but it&apos;s tricky. However, it&apos;s one of the<br/>low-numbered, practical EDOs that the universe gifted us with, so it&apos;s<br/>worthwhile figuring out how to use it. Obviously 12-EDO has some<br/>advantages, like that there&apos;s a near-perfect 3/2, and 5-limit harmony<br/>is great, and 7 is also decent, and so on. But 11-EDO still exists, so<br/>it&apos;s worthwhile figuring out how to use. I don&apos;t really have my head<br/>wrapped around all of it yet. Igs sounds like he&apos;s starting to get it<br/>and I look forward to his new composition.</p><p>As a related tangent - check out the porcupine comma pump I just<br/>posted. To my ears, it sounds very &quot;natural,&quot; in that it sounds like<br/>common practice music that just so happens to be built on porcupine<br/>instead of meantone. I used mostly standard common practice<br/>techniques, but worked the whole thing out so that the progression<br/>only lines up properly if you&apos;re working within a porcupine<br/>temperament. The trick is generalizing this &quot;functional&quot; business to<br/>higher-limit chords and making things want to resolve. I have no idea<br/>how to do it if 3/2 isn&apos;t involved. Either way, once that&apos;s figured<br/>out, working in temperaments like 11-EDO will be a lot easier.</p><p>-Mike</p></div><h3><a id=98450 href="#98450">ðŸ”—</a>Michael &#x3C;djtrancendance@...&#x3E;</h3><span>4/22/2011 11:02:44 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>BTW, on an optimistic note...I&apos;ve found the 9:14:16 &quot;triad&quot; in 11TET to be quite useful.&nbsp; Throw that together with the 8:11:15 and 7:9:11...and 11TET isn&apos;t looking as bad for chords as I thought...though still far from flexible and requiring some quite lenient standards of error even for the above &quot;native 11TET&quot; chords.</p></div><h3><a id=98453 href="#98453">ðŸ”—</a>cityoftheasleep &#x3C;igliashon@...&#x3E;</h3><span>4/22/2011 11:56:02 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, Michael &lt;djtrancendance@...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt; &gt;&quot;The thing with 11-EDO is that you can represent large clusters of it<br/>&gt; &gt; with relatively low harmonics (4:7:9:11:15:17, for instance--that&apos;s 6<br/>&gt; &gt; notes, so more than half of 11-EDO right there&quot;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &nbsp; Pretty cool...if you have the uncanny ability to keep track of chord spread across 2<br/>&gt; octaves like that.</p><p>It&apos;s not supposed to be played as a big block chord (though I guess you could...), the point was to show that melodies won&apos;t have trouble running into/being close tones with notes in the chords.</p><p>&gt; A) That you&apos;re still really dealing, if I have it right, with two types of triads...whereas in 12TET (even in diatonic) you get major/minor/augmented/diminished.</p><p>Nonsense!  The augmented and diminished are not treated as consonances in 12-TET, so I don&apos;t think it&apos;s fair to count them.  If we&apos;re only counting triads that span an 8/5 or less, and not counting inversions as separate chords, 12-TET has 4:5:6, 10:12:15, 8:9:10, and 6:8:9 as its consonant triads.  11-EDO has  7:8:9, 7:9:11, 8:9:11, and [maaaaybe] 11:15:17.  Just because they all come together to form a giant hexad doesn&apos;t invalidate each triad in itself; in fact, that&apos;s kind of a killer feature.  But if we want to add scalar dissonances that work like augmented and diminished, we can do that, too.</p><p>For each triad, there&apos;s a scale that gives plenty of that triad.  For 7:8:9, there&apos;s the hexatonic 2 2 2 2 2 1 I already mentioned.  It&apos;s generated by the 2nd degree of 11-EDO, sort of a stretched whole-tone scale.  We get four 7:8:9 triads, one 7:8:9:11 tetrad, and on the IV and V degrees, we get 8:9:11 triads; on the VI degree, we get a very dissonant 15:16:18 triad.  Note we can invert these chords to span more than an octave, to make 4:7:9, 4:7:9:11, and 4:9:11 consonances and an 8:15:18 &quot;diminished&quot; chord.  This scale is also the best thing going for the questionably-consonant 11:15:17 triads, giving three of them (on degrees IV, V, and VI).</p><p>For 7:9:11, we can use the 4th degree of 11-EDO as a generator, giving a 5-note and an 8-note scale, 3L+2s and 3L+5s (respectively).  The latter kind of sucks melodically, but gives 7:9:11 triads on 6 degrees; I like 1 2 1 1 2 1 2 1 as the tonic mode, since it makes the VIII degree into a &quot;diminished&quot; chord (0-4-6) that&apos;s maybe a badly-tempered 7:9:10 (if anything), and the V degree sort of an &quot;augmented&quot; (0-5-7) that&apos;s our questionable 11:15:17 triad again.</p><p>For 8:9:11, we have the scale generated by the 3rd degree of 11-EDO, which has a 7-note MOS of 4L+3s.  Using the 2 2 1 2 1 2 1 mode, we have otonal triads on I, II, IV, and VI, utonal triads on II, IV, VI, and VII, and diminished triads of 14:15:18 on III and V.  We also get a bonus 7:8:9:11 triad on the I, among other possibilities.  I might like this scale better than the octatonic one above.  It&apos;s a toss-up as to which of these three makes a better &quot;white-key&quot; scale, but I think they&apos;re all good, and with a little consideration can be as useful as anything 12 has to offer.</p><p>The other degrees of 11 (1, 5, 6, and 10) all generate scales that are, well, kind of melodically horrendous (at least insofar as they&apos;d make terrible white-key scales), and also are less efficient than the above three for the available consonant harmonies.</p><p>-Igs</p></div>
