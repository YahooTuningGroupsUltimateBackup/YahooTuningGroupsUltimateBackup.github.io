Like i said , i am not sure who came up with<br/>the latter terms and what parts of the pattern they found essential. I do<br/>believe that the original involved the diophantine equation. i do not know<br/>of a triophantine one:)&lt; i am going out of town and still trying to reach<br/>Erv . At which time i will check and possibility get a definition from him<br/>too although i did mail one to Monz.<br/>    The thing that seems awkward about this is one is not repeating parts<br/>of the harmonic series, in fact they are exclusive. This seems to be on of<br/>the thing Wilson was trying to do. I may not be what the &apos;triaphonic &apos;<br/>inventor wanted to do. Chalmers does have examples of some of things in<br/>his book but have not gotten it all yet. unfortunately. i am leaving in<br/>min for a few days so this will have to wait.<br/>see page 159 of his book or maybe someone can put up these pages in the<br/>mean time</p><p>&quot;David M.
