It came in a box confusingly marked<br/>&quot;live plants&quot;, filled with fake snow and popping wrap. I immediately went<br/>out and got all the accesories for it, stand, bench, speakers...</p><p>Anyway, I already set the two user tunings to Partch&apos;s 43 (of course) and my<br/>own 17-tone jazz tuning:</p><p>1/1 21/20 10/9 9/8 7/6 5/4 21/16 4/3 45/32 3/2 14/9 5/3 27/16 7/4 16/9 15/8<br/>63/32</p><p>It&apos;s a chain of 5 complete 1-3-5-7 hexads and 21/20, for no particular<br/>reason other than to fill the gap there. A 2/1 has a keyboard distance of a<br/>perfect 11th, which reduces the range from 5 octaves to over 3+1/2. I<br/>confess, I had to make a keyboard chart out of posterboard to help find the<br/>notes.</p><p>Ice Piano&apos;s my favorite voice, but isn&apos;t it everybody&apos;s?</p><p>Stay Tuned,<br/>    JI Junkie<br/>    (I like that nickname &apos;cause it has alliteration.)</p></div>
