Hopefully I&apos;ll be able to rejoin in the near future.</p><p>It&apos;s been a great discussion.  I&apos;m particularly happy with the realization that when academic theorists talk about &quot;maximal evenness&quot; (which is a property that only makes sense in a discrete context), they&apos;re really talking about two continuous properties: evenness, and the MOS/DE (or &quot;dual generation&quot;) property.</p><p>Anyway, thanks again.  Sorry to leave so soon!</p><p>DT<br/>--<br/>WARNING: Princeton Email is currently very unreliable.
