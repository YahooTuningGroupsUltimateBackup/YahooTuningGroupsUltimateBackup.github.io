It has a lot of nice<br/>tunings and can play meantone music among its other talents. It would<br/>be a good one to try on a guitar, I think.</p><p>It comes equipped with sixteen notes to the octave; it has a circle of<br/>five meantone fifths of various sizes (various since I did an rms<br/>optimaization), with the final &quot;fifth&quot; actually being an 11/9 neutral<br/>third. It thereby has fifteen fifths, between 6.2 and 4.2 cents flat,<br/>and an 11/9 1.3 cents sharp. Besides that, it has twelve major thirds,<br/>ranging from .17 cents flat to 1.0 cent sharp, thirteen minor thirds<br/>between 4.1 and 6.9 cents flat, seven subminor thirds between 2.97 and<br/>4.0 cents sharp, six 7/4&apos;s between 1.8 and 1.2 cents flat, and a 3.6<br/>cent flat 11/6. It also has twelve major and twelve minor<br/>meantone-related triads, allowing you to fake your way through all<br/>kinds of standard repertorie pieces, six major and minor tetrads,<br/>allowing you do to a lot more than that, and the aforementioned dash<br/>of 11-limit for flavoring.</p><p>! meantune.scl<br/>Meantune scale/temperament<br/>16<br/>!<br/>77.186671<br/>116.099742<br/>193.485158<br/>309.606987<br/>386.992404<br/>425.905475<br/>503.092146<br/>580.123259<br/>620.006163<br/>695.751153<br/>812.878174<br/>890.213971<br/>1007.340993<br/>1083.085983<br/>1122.968886<br/>1200.00000</p></div><h3>Gene Ward Smith &#x3C;gwsmith@svpal.org&#x3E;</h3><span>6/17/2003 7:31:13 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;Gene Ward Smith&quot; &lt;gwsmith@s...&gt; wrote:</p><p>&gt; It comes equipped with sixteen notes to the octave; it has a circle of<br/>&gt; five meantone fifths<br/>^^^^^^^</p><p>Fifteen!</p><p>of various sizes (various since I did an rms<br/>&gt; optimaization), with the final &quot;fifth&quot; actually being an 11/9 neutral<br/>&gt; third.

These were D#, Ab, Db, and A#, as well as<br/>Eb, G#, C#, and Bb already provided.</p><p>It is interesting that a 17th c. type organ built in 1981 by Brombaugh in<br/>the Fairchild Chapel, Oberlin College, Ohio, U.S.A. is tuned to 1/4 comma<br/>mean tone and has three split keys on the Great giving D#/Eb, G#/Ab, and<br/>A#/Bb.  (Kiraly, 1981, Porter 1981).</p><p>Furthermore from Table 6 it can be seen that C# major and F# major cannot be<br/>made good keys by the additin of D# and Ab alone, so these are still<br/>unusable keys on a split key organ.  The require for good intonation the<br/>additional notes E#, A#, Cb.  These extra notes are also available on the<br/>McClure organ, and thus good intonation can be had in all the keys in mean<br/>tone tuning.<br/>***** ***** ***** *****</p><p>The McClure organ was disccused in an earlier chapter &quot;Why do we need<br/>keyboard temperament?&quot; in some detail:</p><p>***** ***** ***** *****<br/>One extant ingenious example is the McClure organ built by Harrison and<br/>Harrison of Durham (McClure 1951) (FIgure 5) which is now in the Department<br/>of Music of the University of Edinburgh.  Dr A.R. McClure ... realised that<br/>the cathedral choirs and madrigal groups sang 16th and 17th century music<br/>unaccompanied because any accompanying instrument tuned in equal temperament<br/>sounded horrible.  Unfortunately, Dr. McClure died before the organ was<br/>completed, but it was finished in 1950 under the sueprvision of Dom Laurence<br/>B&eacute;venot and was first erected in Ampleforth Abbey.  ...   The organ is tuned<br/>to the 19 note scale of Robert Smith, a mid-18th c. Master of Trinity<br/>College, Cambridge.  It has a normal keyboard with the usual five accidental<br/>(black) notes.  There are, however, 19 pipes provided for each octave.  The<br/>organ has seven extra key stops (Figure 6).  When none of these is drawn the<br/>black keys sound the following pipes, C#, Eb, F#, G# and Bb.  This enables<br/>one to play, say, in the key of A major.  To play in the key of Eb major,<br/>the player draws the knob marked Ab.  This causes the middle black keys to<br/>sound the Ab pipes, instead of the G# pipes.<br/>***** ***** ***** *****</p><p>That section goes on to describe a 32-note/octave &quot;Voice Harmonium made by<br/>Colin Brown in 1875&quot; and a just intonation pipe organ built in 1981 by the<br/>Belgian organ builder Stephan Schumacher, based on principles &quot;evolved by<br/>Professor Dr Martin Vogel of the University of Bonn (Vogel 1980), which has<br/>48 pipes per octave.  An electronic instrument with 171 notes per octave is<br/>also mentioned, somehow associated with the previous instrument.</p><p>References for the above excerpts:</p><p>Kiraly W. &amp; P. 1981 &quot;Summer Organ Institute Recital&quot;, the Diapason, Dec<br/>1981, pp 17-18.</p><p>Porter W. 1981 &quot;The Meaning of Mean-Tone Temperament&quot;, The Diapason, Dec<br/>1981, p 19</p><p>McClure A.R. 1951 &quot;An extended mean-tone organ&quot;, The Organ, no 119, pp<br/>139-141</p><p>Vogel M. 1980 Musiktheater I, Bonn</p><p>-Kurt Bigler</p></div><h3>wallyesterpaulrus &#x3C;wallyesterpaulrus@yahoo.com&#x3E;</h3><span>6/18/2003 4:54:27 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;Gene Ward Smith&quot; &lt;gwsmith@s...&gt;<br/>wrote:<br/>&gt; --- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;Gene Ward Smith&quot; &lt;gwsmith@s...&gt;<br/>wrote:<br/>&gt; &gt; --- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;Gene Ward Smith&quot; &lt;gwsmith@s...&gt;<br/>wrote:<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; It comes equipped with sixteen notes to the octave; it has a<br/>circle of<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; five meantone fifths<br/>&gt; &gt; ^^^^^^^<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; Fifteen!<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Do any of the history experts here know if meantone16, with four<br/>split<br/>&gt; keys, was ever actually used?
