La Monte Young has been using 60 Hz as his tuning<br/>basis for years for precisely this reason.</p><p>He says that as a child in the isolation of the Idaho countryside<br/>he was inspired by the hum of the big electric stepdown transformers<br/>that are part of the high-tension-wire systems you see along the<br/>road.  He&apos;s written a piece named after them.</p><p>I haven&apos;t yet read the follow-up to your post, but I&apos;m sure<br/>our European subscribers will point out that their cycle is<br/>50 Hz, and so the fundamental for their tuning would be different.<br/>In fact, when La Monte create his electronic installations in<br/>Europe, he tunes them down to 50 Hz.</p><p>I&apos;ve advocated 1 Hz as an (inaudible) basic fundamental, simply<br/>for mathematic elegance; it&apos;s been adopted by some subscribers<br/>on this List such as Drew Skyfyre.  This gives an audible<br/>fundamental of 64 Hz, which is a 16/15 higher than 60 Hz<br/>and a 32/25 higher than 50 Hz.</p><p>-monz<br/><a href="http://www.ixpres.com/interval/monzo/homepage.html">http://www.ixpres.com/interval/monzo/homepage.html</a></p></div><h3><a id=12585 href="#12585">ðŸ”—</a>Joseph Pehrson &#x3C;josephpehrson@compuserve.com&#x3E;</h3><span>9/10/2000 4:52:33 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@egroups.com">tuning@egroups.com</a>, &quot;Keenan Pepper&quot; &lt;mtpepper@p...&gt; wrote:</p><p><a href="http://www.egroups.com/message/tuning/12575">http://www.egroups.com/message/tuning/12575</a></p><p> This is such a wonderfully<br/>&gt; obscure and useless benefit that I cannot see any reason to use a<br/>global tuning other that 60 hertz.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Useless Suggestions by<br/>&gt;     Keenan P.</p><p>I believe La Monte Young has derived a similar basis for music<br/>derived from the cycles of electric current.
