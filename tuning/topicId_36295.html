I&apos;m *definitely* hearing the<br/>&gt; sopranos singing the &quot;high third&quot; (or &quot;high 10th!&quot;) here...<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Joe</p><p>Thanks for listening, Joe. Yeah, it seems pretty clear to me.</p><p>But this is where I came in here over a year ago. My question then was &quot;why<br/>do they *always* do that?&quot; To some extent it still is.</p><p>However, our hearing the high third generating from a pure JI triad was an<br/>enormous insight for me. At minimum, it raises the possibility that singing<br/>*real* high thirds may have something to do with hearing &quot;illusionary&quot; ones.<br/>That is a &quot;new&quot; piece of the puzzle we didn&apos;t have last year.</p><p>Bob&apos;s idea that the illusion can be &quot;erased&quot; by practice is interesting to<br/>me. It will be of value to see what his choir does when he conducts the<br/>&quot;experiment.&quot; I hear all sorts of high thirds in his posted performance, but<br/>I can&apos;t decide if these are *real* or &quot;illusionary.&quot; They don&apos;t sustain long<br/>enough to really tell. Clearly, the tuning is impeccable. I&apos;m sure Bob will<br/>insist they are singing JI thirds, and indeed they may be.</p><p>We do know now (thanks to Francois) that *my* sopranos aren&apos;t singing a JI<br/>third (tenth) after the fifth comes in. Again, the question is &quot;why.&quot; They<br/>heard the &quot;low&quot; third as being &quot;in tune&quot; (likely JI). Why not hear the triad<br/>third as being &quot;in tune JI&quot; and simply leave it there. If it *sounds* high,<br/>so what? It apparently shouldn&apos;t have to *be* high. For some mysterious<br/>reason they actually *move* the real pitch to where they/I/we seem to hear<br/>the illusionary high third. Woo woooo! Spooky stuff going on here.</p><p>Enter jerries 0 and 00 attempting to locate the relative frequency of the<br/>high third. Results inconclusive. Jerry10 indicates that most folks here<br/>don&apos;t seem to hear the JI illusionary high third, at least not in comparison<br/>to an ET triad. I&apos;m not sure how that reflects on my questions. I&apos;ll have to<br/>think about it.</p><p>Your (and other&apos;s) thoughts, please.</p><p>Jerry</p><p>(By the way, folks, the web page cited above is not linked within my regular<br/>site. It was created just for illustrating my points here, so please excuse<br/>its stark appearance. :-)</p></div><h3><a id=36319 href="#36319">ðŸ”—</a>emotionaljourney22 &#x3C;paul@stretch-music.com&#x3E;</h3><span>4/8/2002 10:47:04 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In tuning@y..., &quot;jpehrson2&quot; &lt;jpehrson@r...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt; --- In tuning@y..., Gerald Eskelin &lt;stg3music@e...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; <a href="/tuning/topicId_36295.html#36295">/tuning/topicId_36295.html#36295</a><br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; Hello &quot;high third&quot; followers:<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; Since the basses immediately move the pitch high in the<br/>&gt; original &quot;High third<br/>&gt; &gt; demo,&quot; I have electronically moved the vocals down to match a new<br/>C<br/>&gt; played<br/>&gt; &gt; on a synth.</p><p>how far did you move them? 7 cents?</p></div><h3><a id=36337 href="#36337">ðŸ”—</a>Gerald Eskelin &#x3C;stg3music@earthlink.net&#x3E;</h3><span>4/10/2002 5:27:37 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>On 4/9/02 6:24 PM, &quot;<a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>&quot; &lt;<a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>&gt; wrote:</p><p>&gt; Message: 11<br/>&gt;  Date: Tue, 09 Apr 2002 05:47:04 -0000<br/>&gt;  From: &quot;emotionaljourney22&quot; &lt;<a href="mailto:paul@stretch-music.com">paul@stretch-music.com</a>&gt;<br/>&gt; Subject: Re: Retuned high third demo<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; --- In tuning@y..., &quot;jpehrson2&quot; &lt;jpehrson@r...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;&gt; --- In tuning@y..., Gerald Eskelin &lt;stg3music@e...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt; <a href="/tuning/topicId_36295.html#36295">/tuning/topicId_36295.html#36295</a><br/>&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt; Hello &quot;high third&quot; followers:<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt; Since the basses immediately move the pitch high in the<br/>&gt;&gt; original &quot;High third<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt; demo,&quot; I have electronically moved the vocals down to match a new<br/>&gt; C<br/>&gt;&gt; played<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt; on a synth.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; how far did you move them? 7 cents?</p><p>Something short of a semitone, as I remember.
