I do not think<br/>I can convey how much all this means to me.</p><p>Let me try to make some points:</p><p>1. There was no Tanpura when jaati gaan and muoorchchhanaa were to the<br/>fore --  until drupad and, later, khayal singing replaced jaati gaan.<br/>According to one estimate, Tanpura may have been introduced around the<br/>12th-13th century.</p><p>2. The concept of shruti has always been there -- the earliest<br/>authentic reference would be Bharat Muni&apos;s Natyashastra.</p><p>Again, shruti means &quot;heard&quot; or &quot;audible&quot; in Sanskrit: it is sung (or<br/>played), not in isolation, but as an integral part of singing. Shruti,<br/>as apart from singing (or playing) can exist only for its analysis.<br/>Any such analytical study would result in some hypothesis which would<br/>then tested in context of singing.</p><p>3. Shruti-s are NOT equal. There are some musicians who believe they<br/>are equal, but when there is a difference of opinion, we would always<br/>go back to &quot;pramaaNa&quot; (authenticity) as found in Natyashastra or<br/>Sangita-ratnakara.</p><p>As mentioned in the standard Sanskrit texts on music, there are five<br/>classes of shruti-s: (1) dipta [pronounced deeptaa], meaning blazing,<br/>brilliant; (2) ayata [pronounced aayataa], meaning spread over,<br/>extended; (3) karuna [pronounced karuNaa], meaning compassion, pathos;<br/>(4) mrudu, meaning tender; and (5) madhyaa, meaning moderate, medium.<br/>So, various shruti-s were designed to perform differevt aesthetic<br/>functions -- they cannot be equal.</p><p>4. About Danielou&apos;s opinions, I would humbly suggest we should stick<br/>to the aesthetics and the related theory -- not mixing it with any<br/>other considerations, however interesting they may be.</p><p>5. Bharat Muni did not refer to ANY mathematical terms or ratios or<br/>fractions -- he refers only to three numerals: 9, 13 and 22. And if an<br/>anecdote or legend cannot be supported by the texts, it is to be<br/>discarded.</p><p>6. Sitar has a number of NOTES (20, 26 ...), not shruti-s.</p><p>7. As traditionally rendered, Hindustani music contains absolutely no<br/>modulation.</p><p>8. The harmonics of the Tanpura, tuned in G3 C4 C4 C3, have been<br/>studied, using spectrograms. The shruti-s (perceived &apos;notes&apos;) reported<br/>include: SA 1/1, Re 9/8, Ga 5/4, Pa 3/2, Ni komal (flat) 7/4, Ni 15/8,<br/>as also Ma 21/16, and Dha 27/16. These do not fully agree with the<br/>traditional Indian gamut tables.</p><p>9. In practice, the contemporary Indian music may be said to be based<br/>on 12 notes, JI, 5-limit, with shruti-s close to those 12 notes (the<br/>12 notes themselves being shruti-s, of course). The singer does not<br/>&apos;stay&apos; on the remaining 10 shruti-s usually, but tastefully touches<br/>and passes through them.</p><p>Nevertheless, he DOES use all shruti-s, according to his sense of<br/>aesthetics, even if mostly unknowingly. That is the reason &quot;meend&quot;<br/>(glissando) is so very important in Indian music.</p><p>Regards,<br/>Haresh.</p></div><h3>Gene Ward Smith &#x3C;gwsmith@svpal.org&#x3E;</h3><span>1/30/2006 8:46:30 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;Haresh BAKSHI&quot; &lt;hareshbakshi@h...&gt; wrote:</p><p>&gt; 8.

I do not think<br/>&gt; I can convey how much all this means to me.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Let me try to make some points:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; 1. There was no Tanpura when jaati gaan and muoorchchhanaa were to the<br/>&gt; fore --  until drupad and, later, khayal singing replaced jaati gaan.<br/>&gt; According to one estimate, Tanpura may have been introduced around the<br/>&gt; 12th-13th century.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; 2. The concept of shruti has always been there -- the earliest<br/>&gt; authentic reference would be Bharat Muni&apos;s Natyashastra.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Again, shruti means &quot;heard&quot; or &quot;audible&quot; in Sanskrit: it is sung (or<br/>&gt; played), not in isolation, but as an integral part of singing. Shruti,<br/>&gt; as apart from singing (or playing) can exist only for its analysis.<br/>&gt; Any such analytical study would result in some hypothesis which would<br/>&gt; then tested in context of singing.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; 3. Shruti-s are NOT equal. There are some musicians who believe they<br/>&gt; are equal, but when there is a difference of opinion, we would always<br/>&gt; go back to &quot;pramaaNa&quot; (authenticity) as found in Natyashastra or<br/>&gt; Sangita-ratnakara.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; As mentioned in the standard Sanskrit texts on music, there are five<br/>&gt; classes of shruti-s: (1) dipta [pronounced deeptaa], meaning blazing,<br/>&gt; brilliant; (2) ayata [pronounced aayataa], meaning spread over,<br/>&gt; extended; (3) karuna [pronounced karuNaa], meaning compassion, pathos;<br/>&gt; (4) mrudu, meaning tender; and (5) madhyaa, meaning moderate, medium.<br/>&gt; So, various shruti-s were designed to perform differevt aesthetic<br/>&gt; functions -- they cannot be equal.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; 4. About Danielou&apos;s opinions, I would humbly suggest we should stick<br/>&gt; to the aesthetics and the related theory -- not mixing it with any<br/>&gt; other considerations, however interesting they may be.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; 5. Bharat Muni did not refer to ANY mathematical terms or ratios or<br/>&gt; fractions -- he refers only to three numerals: 9, 13 and 22. And if an<br/>&gt; anecdote or legend cannot be supported by the texts, it is to be<br/>&gt; discarded.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; 6. Sitar has a number of NOTES (20, 26 ...), not shruti-s.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; 7. As traditionally rendered, Hindustani music contains absolutely no<br/>&gt; modulation.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; 8. The harmonics of the Tanpura, tuned in G3 C4 C4 C3, have been<br/>&gt; studied, using spectrograms. The shruti-s (perceived &apos;notes&apos;) reported<br/>&gt; include: SA 1/1, Re 9/8, Ga 5/4, Pa 3/2, Ni komal (flat) 7/4, Ni 15/8,<br/>&gt; as also Ma 21/16, and Dha 27/16. These do not fully agree with the<br/>&gt; traditional Indian gamut tables.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; 9. In practice, the contemporary Indian music may be said to be based<br/>&gt; on 12 notes, JI, 5-limit, with shruti-s close to those 12 notes (the<br/>&gt; 12 notes themselves being shruti-s, of course). The singer does not<br/>&gt; &apos;stay&apos; on the remaining 10 shruti-s usually, but tastefully touches<br/>&gt; and passes through them.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Nevertheless, he DOES use all shruti-s, according to his sense of<br/>&gt; aesthetics, even if mostly unknowingly. That is the reason &quot;meend&quot;<br/>&gt; (glissando) is so very important in Indian music.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Regards,<br/>&gt; Haresh.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;</p></div><h3>Haresh BAKSHI &#x3C;hareshbakshi@hotmail.com&#x3E;</h3><span>2/1/2006 8:55:00 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Dear Ozan, thanks for your input.</p><p>With moorchchhana-s replaced by raga-s, and with the Tanpura now an<br/>integral part in Hindustani music, even a semblance of modulation is<br/>ruled out.</p><p>A fourth or a fifth above the fundamental certainly may become a kind<br/>of tonal center around which raga patterns are woven for elaboration<br/>and improvisation; but such activity, however intense, continues to<br/>exist only in relation to the fundamental (streaming from the Tanpura).</p><p>However, the more important centers in a raga are its Sonant note<br/>(vaadi) and Consonant note (samvaadi).

Still, I have to take the blame for the spelling &quot;diaschismic&quot;.</p><p>2048/2025 is the diaschisma, so diaschismatic has to refer to scales that temper out this interval, like schismatic scales temper out the schisma.  There isn&apos;t one obvious 7-limit extension so you always have to qualify what kind of diaschismatic you&apos;re looking at.  But 46&amp;58 is the most obvious because it&apos;s best in the region where the optimal 5-limit tuning is likely to be (depending on how you optimize it).</p><p>A tuning around 46 is also a good fit for some justifications of the Indian shruti scale.  We have to be careful about stealing names from another culture but &quot;srutal&quot; isn&apos;t such a bad choice.</p><p>The 22&amp;46 &quot;shrutar&quot; temperament is qualitatively different.  Although it tempers out the diaschisma, it does so with contorsion.  The generator is half the size it would be in a diaschismatic temperament.  So it isn&apos;t diaschismatic but it is related.</p><p>&gt; 5-limit diaschism(at)ic does include 22, as well as 56, in addition to &gt; the ones supported by 7-limit diaschism(at)ic, in the sense that the &gt; name has been used for a specific 7-limit temperament. This temperament &gt; also shows up in higher limit lists, as for instance a 13-limit version &gt; with this generator mapping:<br/>&gt; &gt; &lt;2, 3, 5, 7, 9, 10]<br/>&gt; &lt;0, 1, -2, -8, -12, -15]<br/>&gt; &gt; which is supported by 46-ET and 58-ET.

I&apos;m looking at the 19-limit, so here&apos;s an extension of that mapping:</p><p>&lt;2, 3, 5, 7, 9, 10, 8, 13]<br/>&lt;0, 1, -2, -8, -12, -15, 1, -26]</p><p>It&apos;s good in the 13-limit, and can easily come top of the list in the 17-limit.  I don&apos;t think there&apos;s any music to demonstrate how good it is in reality but Gene&apos;s worked on 46-equal in the 17-limit so that day may not be far off.  It isn&apos;t so good in the 19-limit though.  These diaschismatics come ahead of it in my relatively short list:</p><p>&lt;2, 3, 5, 3, 5, 6, 8, 5]<br/>&lt;0, 1, -2, 15, 11, 8, 1, 20]</p><p>&lt;4, 6, 10, 13, 17, 18, 16, 17]<br/>&lt;0, 1, -2, -5, -9, -9, 1, 0]</p><p>and this shrutar:</p><p>&lt;2, 3, 5, 5, 7, 6, 8, 7]<br/>&lt;0, 2, -4, 7, -1, 16, 2, 17]</p><p>So in general it looks like an important bag of temperaments but no single, obvious mapping.

I can&apos;t speak for Messaien, but one can see the period of the temperament where 2025:2048 vanishes as accomplishing a delicate balancing act between representing 45:32 and representing 64:45. All temperaments are about such balancing acts, but it&apos;s just an algebraic happenstance that here the representation of the octave can be expressed as a multiple of either of the two JI intervals above.</p><p>Two points I want to be loud and clear about, Kraig:</p><p>In my Middle Path paper, I deliberately omitted systems that result from a &quot;chop and slice&quot; approach even if they looked better than some of the systems in the paper according to the very complexity and error penalties used to select the latter. For example, a system like meantone, but with the generator split in half, would only be 2 times as complex as meantone, and have equal errors. But you can view the tuning as consisting of two meantone chains, and if one of the chains contains your 1/1, then no 5-limit ratios are ever going to map to the other chain. In the tunings in my paper, by contrast, every single note derives directly from ratios in the relevant JI lattice. So any &quot;chopping and slicing&quot; which introduces notes foreign to the JI foundation is ruled out in my approach.  I&apos;m not sure whether this has been clear to you or not; I suspect if I made generalized keyboard designs for each of the systems in my paper, with every button labeled with ratios, it might be clearer.</p><p>The second point is that knowing the generator of a tuning system is often one of the least important pieces of information for me as a musician. Scales like my decatonics are scales that you can play melodies in, find coherent sequences of harmonies in that don&apos;t divide the tuning into separate subsets, form a great basis for notation and key signatures, and certainly preserve the octave as the interval of equivalence. Since a single harmonic web connects all 10 notes (pitch classes) in the scale, it&apos;s barely significant to me that you can&apos;t lay out all 10 notes along a single chain of identical (or similar) generators. In my way of thinking, all the scales in my paper are about forming a single, coherent harmonic web that connects all of the notes. The representation in terms of period and generator is a mathematical convenience of these all being two-dimensional systems (when the octave is understood as a movement up or down in pitch), but doesn&apos;t hold any singificance in terms of the way they&apos;re initially conceived (as temperings of (sets of) commas out of JI) and doesn&apos;t have great significance in the musical realm either.</p><p>Hopefully that sums up why I think &quot;chop and slice&quot; is inappropriate if used in reference to the systems in my paper.

But it seems that in<br/>&gt; &gt; ma-grama, the imperfect 13-sruti intervals are sruti 2 to sruti 15, sruti 1 to sruti<br/>&gt; &gt; 14, and sruti 3 to sruti 16.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Makes sense, but again, the interval from 2 to 15 differs from a 3/2<br/>&gt; by 2048/2025.</p><p>Not &quot;again&quot;, but for the first time.</p><p>&gt;<br/>&gt; [...]<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Keenan<br/>&gt;</p></div><h3>wallyesterpaulrus &#x3C;wallyesterpaulrus@yahoo.com&#x3E;</h3><span>2/20/2006 11:18:20 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;Dave Keenan&quot; &lt;d.keenan@...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; --- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;wallyesterpaulrus&quot;<br/>&gt; &lt;wallyesterpaulrus@&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; That very dimension or rank (2) is contradicted by the<br/>&gt; term &apos;linear&apos;.

Surely there can be no argument against<br/>that!</p><p>&gt; &gt; Glad someone agrees with me at last about keys!<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Well, I suggest we keep the term &quot;key&quot; (as in &quot;key change&quot;)<br/>&gt; for use in the Western sense.  But &quot;modulation&quot; seems fair<br/>&gt; game.</p><p>That is a paradoxical suggestion. Key is the prerequisite of modulation per<br/>se. First of all you need to establish a default pitch-plane, then determine<br/>the number of tones therefrom, and then acquire modes from a master-scale<br/>thru which you can modulate. If the number of tones are sufficient,<br/>transpositions too become feasible, and hence, you can change &grave;keys&grave; also<br/>while modulating.</p><p>Alternatively, as in the example I have played on my piano, you can set a<br/>key/tonal centre without &grave;linear transpositions&grave;. Instead, you substitute<br/>that with &grave;non-linear mapping&grave;, which amounts to &grave;modulation&grave; once again.<br/>Still, you and I do not desist from calling it a key.</p><p>In a 7-note diatonical major scale, no transpositions are possible, but<br/>modulations are the order of the day.</p><p>In an historical 12-tone framework, you make a giant leap forward and<br/>combine modulations with transpositions which yield &grave;tonality&grave;, hence &grave;keys&grave;<br/>the way most of us Western oriented folks are used to say.</p><p>In contrast, Maqam Music pitches are much more numerous, which automatically<br/>imply modulations and transpositions. Hence, Maqam Music is tonal and is<br/>based on keys likewise. Here, I find it imperative to expand the term &grave;key&grave;<br/>to accomodate Maqams, because the perdes are deeply connected with the way a<br/>Maqam flows (as in Buselik using perde buselik, Hijaz using perde hijaz,<br/>Mahur, using perde mahur, etc...).</p><p>While I&apos;ll admit to the fact that not all musical genres are based on<br/>&grave;tonality&grave; in the Western sense, I am very certain that none exist that lack<br/>&grave;modulation&grave;.</p><p>FWIW, I used the term &quot;modal modulation&quot; for years<br/>&gt; on this list to clarify the two meanings of this overloaded<br/>&gt; term.<br/>&gt;</p><p>I don&apos;t see the significance of such a discrimination. For all I know, it is<br/>the &quot;type of modulation based on harmonic tonality&quot; which needs to be<br/>explained aside from simple and generalized &grave;modulation&grave;.</p><p>&gt; -Carl<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;</p><p>Oz.</p></div><h3>Ozan Yarman &#x3C;ozanyarman@ozanyarman.com&#x3E;</h3><span>2/22/2006 12:37:57 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Dear Haresh, you can read my response to Carl on this matter.</p><p>Cordially,<br/>Ozan</p><p>----- Original Message -----<br/>From: &quot;Haresh BAKSHI&quot; &lt;<a href="mailto:hareshbakshi@hotmail.com">hareshbakshi@hotmail.com</a>&gt;<br/>To: &lt;<a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>&gt;<br/>Sent: 22 &iuml;&iquest;&half;ubat 2006 &iuml;&iquest;&half;ar&iuml;&iquest;&half;amba 6:54<br/>Subject: [tuning] No drone in Indian music before 12th century (was: Re:<br/>More on shruti-s)</p><p>&gt; Dear Ozan, I have the same question that Carl has:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; The key is there; where is the modulation, or, where are the modulations?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Regards,<br/>&gt; Haresh.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;</p></div><h3>wallyesterpaulrus &#x3C;wallyesterpaulrus@yahoo.com&#x3E;</h3><span>2/22/2006 12:53:14 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Again, one of my problems with &quot;multi-linear&quot; is that the word already has another meaning in close conceptual proximity for me: &quot;multilinear algebra&quot; is what we use in general in the theory of wedgies, vals, etc., which applied to all these types of temperament.</p><p>But for an ET, &quot;multi-point&quot; doesn&apos;t quite get across, as well as &quot;circular&quot; or &quot;cyclic&quot;, the way that the points are all generated in a topologically regular way, just as &quot;linear&quot; does in its sphere of relevance.

As<br/>the chroma can be expressed as a distance of 7 fifths (not counting the<br/>octave inversions, of course), in fact, our point is to find a fifth which,<br/>when stacked 7 times, makes 50/3 (i.e. the 5-limit chroma + 4 octaves). When<br/>you divide the size of the 50/3 into 7 equal parts (and you can try this out<br/>on your own by doing &quot;Calculate 50/3 \ 7&quot; in Scala), you get a fifth which I<br/>think is just the one you found. If you try &quot;Equal 7 50/3 11&quot; and then<br/>&quot;Normalize&quot;, you actually get a chain of 11 fifths upwards (i.e. from C to<br/>E#) in 2/7-comma meantone.</p><p>Petr</p></div><h3>Ozan Yarman &#x3C;ozanyarman@ozanyarman.com&#x3E;</h3><span>2/23/2006 2:27:49 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>----- Original Message -----<br/>From: &quot;wallyesterpaulrus&quot; &lt;<a href="mailto:wallyesterpaulrus@yahoo.com">wallyesterpaulrus@yahoo.com</a>&gt;<br/>To: &lt;<a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>&gt;<br/>Sent: 23 &iuml;&iquest;&half;ubat 2006 Per&iuml;&iquest;&half;embe 2:07<br/>Subject: [tuning] No drone in Indian music before 12th century (was: Re:<br/>More on shruti-s)</p><p>&gt; --- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;Ozan Yarman&quot; &lt;ozanyarman@...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; I&apos;ve truly had enough of this Westernist monopolization.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Are you accusing Haresh of this too?<br/>&gt;</p><p>How should I know if Haresh is Westernized or not?

Never heard of it, nor<br/>&gt; found the need to use such an awkward concept. Here is what the Harvard<br/>&gt; Dictionary of Music 4th edition has to say on transposition:<br/>&gt; ...<br/>&gt; &gt; There is no mention of anything such as &grave;tonal transposition&grave; here, nor<br/>&gt; anywhere else I could readily reach.</p><p>More often than with transposition, it is used with more specific instances like imitations, sequences and fugue subjects. They are either real transpositions, interval for interval, which constitute a new tonality, or tonal. These latter ones stay inside the established tonality for the price of exchanging major and minor intervals, fifths and fourths.</p><p>&gt; &gt; Modulation in the Western sense! Now that is something to be explained aside<br/>&gt; from modulation in an intercontinental/universal sense.</p><p>Western modulation means establishing a key, and the only Western way to establish a key is with IV-V-I or II-V-I cadence, and then establishing a different key by the same means. Hackneyed example:</p><p>Take a march in, say, F. There is an introduction, a high register melodic strain (repeated), a strain of broken chords in the low register (repeated), and then it&apos;s time for the trio, which will normally be in Bb. Instead of simply continuing in the other key (&quot;gear shift&quot; I think it&apos;s called in English) there are two extra bars where the tuba goes F-Eb-D-C. The F (plus five other tones) is common to F and Bb major and is ambiguous. The Eb is foreign to F and tells you that a modulation may be going on. As it happens, the next 1, first chord in the trio, is Bb; there really was a modulation. Without the two bars of preparation, you have a key change, but no modulation (this is not supposed to happen in classical music). Without the concluding Bb, your tonality is not established and you have to wait for the modulation to be completed (which, post-Satie, may never happen).</p><p>In Gregorian chant, modulation occurs (1) when a piece exceeds the octave (going from authentic to plagal or the other way around), (2) starts in D, but suddenly ends a number of phrases in E, or (3) uses an unusual repercussa (tenor, dominant), but (not 4) not when the authentic D-mode switches between B and Bb to avoid a mi-contra-fa (it is not known if this happened in monophonic music; it does in early polyphony). There may be more possibilities to use that term.</p><p>These two kinds of modulations have nothing to do with each other, and it is probably common to refer to the chant kind of modulation by an original latin term like modulatio or modus mixtus.</p><p>It is conceivable that a piece in a D-mode introduces an Eb o an F#. Your kanun sample had a lot of this, but I am not aware that it happens in Gregorian chant. Now if you want to talk about Western polyphony and Gregorian chant, you can refer to &quot;molation&quot; and &quot;modulatio&quot;. If you want to talk about makam music and Western polyphony, you can use &quot;modulation&quot; and &quot;mixed modes&quot;. What if you want to compare the moddal concepts of makam and Gregorian chant? Best to use, and teach us, the term used within the makam tradition, all along, and nothing universal, please.</p><p>didn&apos;t want to join in again.<br/>klaus</p></div><h3>Yahya Abdal-Aziz &#x3C;yahya@melbpc.org.au&#x3E;</h3><span>3/1/2006 4:43:21 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Hallo all,</p><p>On Wed, 22 Feb 2006, &quot;wallyesterpaulrus&quot; wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; --- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;Carl Lumma&quot; &lt;clumma@...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;22 35 51|<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; This seems significant.<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; -C.<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; Indeed!
