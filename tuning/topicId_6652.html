I do know that Papa Bach was fond of arranging<br/>his pieces for more than one instrument, and he also liked to arrange<br/>other composer&apos;s works for instruments other than what the original was<br/>written for. I have also read that Bach did not specify any particular<br/>instrument when he wrote Art of Fugue. Personally, I&apos;ve always enjoyed<br/>hearing more than one take on a piece of music...the music, I feel, is<br/>more important than the instrument. It&apos;s all in the service of the art.<br/>   As far as Debussy and guitar, I hate to be vague, but it seems I read<br/>once where Debussy was supposed to meet with a certain classical<br/>guitarist to get some insights into writing for the instrument....the<br/>guitarist, unfortunately, never showed up, and Debussy died shortly<br/>thereafter...maybe someone knows the details of this story....I love<br/>Girl w/Flaxen Hair on guitar, and play in in the key of G...Hstick</p></div>
