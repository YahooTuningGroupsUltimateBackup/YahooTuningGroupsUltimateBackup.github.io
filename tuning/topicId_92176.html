His scale in 12-EDO is 1 2 1 2 2 1 2 1, which I pointed out has 4 large steps and 4 small steps, so could be a permutation of the diminished scale, and thus would work in any EDO divisible by 4.  I looked at a 36-EDO version that gives excellent 7-limit harmonies, but it drastically worsens both 3-limit and 5-limit harmony to do this.</p><p>Since Mike found the scale in 12-tET, we can also look at his scale as being a subset of other scales.  For starters, let&apos;s look at it as the subset of a 9-note scale of 1 2 1 2 1 1 1 2 1, a scale of 6 small steps and 3 large steps, which results in breaking down one of the large steps to two small steps.  When made distributionally-even, it looks like 1 1 2 1 1 2 1 1 2.  This scale will work in any EDO divisible by 3, so we know that 2s+L=400 cents.  So we know that some degrees of the scale will be constant, regardless of the EDO we choose, and others will be variable:<br/>I: 0 cents<br/>II: s cents<br/>III: 400-s cents<br/>IV: 400 cents<br/>V: 400+L cents<br/>VI: 800-s cents<br/>VII: 800 cents<br/>VIII: 800+s cents<br/>IX: 1200-s cents</p><p>Mike wants some stronger 7-limit harmony, but probably not at the expense of the 3-limit.  This means we need the VI to be around 700 cents; this forces us to have an s not too far from 100 cents.  If we want a strong 7th harmonic, we&apos;d have to look at another mode, because there&apos;s no room in either the VIII or IX degree to have an approximate 7th harmonic.  If we make VIII 800+L instead, giving enough room to approximate 7/4, then we&apos;d want an L between 160 or 175 cents or so to get an approximate 7/4; since 2s+L=400, we&apos;d get an s between 120 and 112.5; the former gives 680 cents on the VI degree, and suggests 30-EDO.  The latter gives 687.5 cents on the VI degree, and suggests 96-EDO.</p><p>OTOH, we can try making IX be 1200-L cents to approximate 7/4, suggesting an L between 240 and 225 cents or so, giving an s between 80 cents and 87.5.  The former gives 720 cents on the VI degree, and suggests 15-EDO; the latter gives 712.5 cents on the VI degree, and suggests 96-EDO as well.  So regardless of how we approach it, 96-EDO seems to be a good option.  However, this is also suggestive of Augene temperament, so looking at TOP Augene may be the best solution.</p><p>Next approach: back in 12-EDO, we can take that 9-note scale apart even further: from 1 2 1 2 1 1 1 2 1, we can get 1 1 1 1 2 1 1 1 2 1, which is 2L+8s.  This suggests even-numbered EDOs, or a period of 1/2 octave (L+4s=600 cents, IOW).  To get the best 7-limit harmony from this scale, I&apos;ll just cut the crap and say we&apos;re looking at Pajara temperament, since I know Pajara is optimized for 7-limit harmony AND gives a scale of this configuration.    Since 22-EDO is pretty good for Pajara, let&apos;s take a look at how it renders Mike&apos;s scale: we&apos;ve got an s of 2 steps and an L of 3; how do we get Mike&apos;s 8-note scale out of this?  We add some small steps together and maybe move the large steps around, to get: 2 4 2 3 4 2 3 2, 2 4 2 4 3 2 3 2, 2 3 2 4 4 2 3 2, or 2 4 2 3 3 2 4 2.  I leave it to Mike to find out which one he likes best.</p><p>But why stop at a 10-note scale?  Let&apos;s go back to 12-tET and break it down further, to an 11-note superscale, 1 1 1 1 1 2 1 1 1 1 1.  This gives 10s+1L, which is not very helpful in finding a pattern of EDOs.  Technically, any EDO greater than 12 will work for this MOS shape.  However, we want our 8-note subset to have some specific harmonic properties.  Our subset could be something like s 2s s 2s L s 2s s, or s 2s s 2s 2s s L s, or s L s 2s 2s s 2s s.  We probably want L to be not too far from 2s in size; maybe it should be bigger, maybe smaller.  This is where the guess-work starts.  For simplicity&apos;s sake, let&apos;s say (5s/4)&lt;/=L&lt;/=(5s).  This gives us 45-EDO, 35-EDO, 34-EDO, 23-EDO, 12-EDO, 13-EDO, 14-EDO, and 15-EDO.  None of these produce scales with any accuracy in the 3-limit except for 12-EDO, and none of them produce scales with strong 7-limit harmony, either.  So the 11-note superscale is probably a bad choice.</p><p>Hope this helps, Mike!</p><p>-Igs</p></div><h3><a id=92180 href="#92180">ðŸ”—</a>genewardsmith &#x3C;genewardsmith@...&#x3E;</h3><span>8/30/2010 1:48:59 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;cityoftheasleep&quot; &lt;igliashon@...&gt; wrote:<br/> So the 11-note superscale is probably a bad choice.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Hope this helps, Mike!</p><p>You never got to the 12-note superscale.

The point of my exercise was trying to first find MOS superscales that could contain Mike&apos;s scale based on its step-configuration in 12-tET, and then to find some good tunings for each scale given Mike&apos;s harmonic wish-list.  There&apos;s only one tuning for an MOS of ssssssssssss or LLLLLLLLLLLL, and that&apos;s 12-tET, assuming octaves are pure.</p><p>-Igs</p></div><h3><a id=92217 href="#92217">ðŸ”—</a>Mike Battaglia &#x3C;battaglia01@...&#x3E;</h3><span>8/31/2010 2:32:06 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Igs,</p><p>This is awesome. Thanks for taking the time out to do it. The fact<br/>that it works in Pajara as a subset of a 10-note permuted MOS scale is<br/>basically the hunch that I had, although I couldn&apos;t see it at the<br/>time. Hopefully it turns out to be a major/augmented^7 variant of the<br/>decatonic scales. That is, mixolydian:ionian::this scale:spm.</p><p>I only have the time to scan this right now, but I&apos;ll delve more into<br/>this in the morning.</p><p>-Mike</p><p>On Mon, Aug 30, 2010 at 4:01 PM, cityoftheasleep<br/>&lt;igliashon@...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; For those just tuning in: Mike B. found a scale he liked in 12-EDO and wants to find a better harmonic tuning for it.
