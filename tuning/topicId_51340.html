Burroughs</p><p>&quot;... simple, chaotic, anarchic and menacing.... This is what people of today<br/>have lost and need most - the ability to experience permanent bodily and<br/>mental ecstasy, to be a receiving station for messages howling by on the ether from<br/>other worlds and nonhuman entities, those peculiar short-wave messages which<br/>come in static-free in the secret pleasure center in the brain.&quot; - Slava Ranko<br/>(Donald L. Philippi)</p><p>    The German word for &quot;noise&quot; _Ger&auml;usch_ is derived from _rauschen_ &quot;the<br/>sound of the wind,&quot; related to _Rausch_ &quot;ecstasy, intoxication&quot; hinting at some<br/>of the possible aesthetic, bodily effects of noise in music.

It has failed to understand that the world is not for the beholding. It<br/>is for the hearing. It is not legible, but audible. ... Music is a herald,<br/>for change is inscribed in noise faster than it transforms society. ...<br/>Listening to music is listening to all noise, realizing that its appropriation and<br/>control is a reflection of power, that is essentially political.&quot; - Jacques<br/>Attali, _Noise: The Political Economy of Music_</p><p>    &quot;The sky and its stars make music in you.&quot; - Dendera, Egypt wall<br/>inscription</p><p>&quot;Sound as an isolated object of reproduction, call it our collective memory<br/>bank... Any sound can be you.&quot; - DJ Spooky that Subliminal Kid (a.k.a. Paul D.<br/>Miller)</p><p>&quot;Overhead, without any fuss, the stars were going out.&quot;<br/>        --Arthur C.
