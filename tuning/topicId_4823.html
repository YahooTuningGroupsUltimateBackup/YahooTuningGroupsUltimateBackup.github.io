Thank you very much, Paul.</p><p>You&apos;re welcome, though it&apos;s certainly been said more clearly. Since you<br/>liked that, though, I should point out that most of the scales I (and Dave<br/>Keenan) are interested in, and have discussed on this list, operate in just<br/>this way -- they trade off a small deviation from JI (which may actually be<br/>desirable) for an increase in the number of consonant harmonies.</p><p>&gt;On the standard E9th pedal steel tuning, many players tune two distinct F#<br/>&gt;notes to get that last triad in JI.

(Thanks Margo for the inspiration.)</p></div><h3><a id=4841 href="#4841">ðŸ”—</a>Bob Lee &#x3C;quasar@b0b.com&#x3E;</h3><span>9/14/1999 6:42:38 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>&gt; So how do you play an F#sus4 chord? (Thanks Margo for the inspiration.)</p><p>We usually put the bar on the second fret and raise the G# string to A.  :-)</p><p>In all serious, a sus4 based on the second note of the scale wouldn&apos;t be<br/>played in the root position.  Most steel players would move the bar up two<br/>frets so they could get the pure JI 4th and 5th harmonies.  The F# note<br/>itself would then be tuned in unison with the 12tet instruments.</p><p>    -b0b-  <a href="http://www.b0b.com/infoedu/just_e9.html">http://www.b0b.com/infoedu/just_e9.html</a></p></div>
