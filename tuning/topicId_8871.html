Anyway, I&apos;d like to once again say that I&apos;m very thankful<br/>for John and his efforts in creating this place for TD members to post<br/>and share their music - just stay away from that (horrifically no fi)<br/>Lo Fi option!</p><p>Much of what Johnny Reinhard wrote earlier today about list diversity<br/>(and diversity in general) will of course apply more broadly to the<br/>music we make (and will each like or dislike, etc.) as well, &quot;Clearly,<br/>we each have our biases towards specific tunings, and conversely<br/>against others.&quot; And for better and worse, that *is* one of the things<br/>I like about John&apos;s <a href="http://mp3.com">mp3.com</a> site... it is a sort of ever-growing<br/>musical extension of the diversity of discourse that occurs here at<br/>the TD.</p><p>Dan</p><p>BTW, a reminder to Johnny Reinhard: those who get the TD in digest<br/>form will not be able to read your posts if you send them as file<br/>attachments.</p></div>
