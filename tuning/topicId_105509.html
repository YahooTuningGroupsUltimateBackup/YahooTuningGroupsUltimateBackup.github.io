I don&apos;t know Russian but I do know the Cyrillic letters (although even that is a challenge as there are several here that are not used in modern Russian).  The red letters in the main paragraph seem to say Ut Re Mi Fa Sol Le (sic- well that&apos;s one of the obsolete characters that, I read, is not &quot;a&quot; despite appearances) and I fancy I can discern other non-Slavic sequences including &quot;bemol&quot;, &quot;diezis&quot;, &quot;pianie&quot;, &quot;organie&quot;.

What<br/>I say is my not-so-educated guess, but may ask some helpful<br/>questions.</p><p>My first hypothesis might be that A-F-D-A-D in position 1 of the<br/>circle represents untransposed D Dorian, the First Mode of the<br/>Latin system more or less equivalent to Protus in the Byzantine<br/>system with its offshoots in Russia and Ukrainia. We can read<br/>these notes as representing the three principal steps of the mode<br/>according to Zarlino: the final D, and the notes a third and<br/>fifth above it. This final-third-fifth scheme, which Zarlino<br/>applies to all the modes, is a simplification of the usual<br/>approach where the confinal or reciting tone, often heard in the<br/>course of a piece more than the concluding final, may be a third,<br/>fourth, fifth, or sixth above the final.</p><p>If we agree that the center is D, then there is still ambiguity<br/>as to what kind of modality or tonality Diletsky assumes or is<br/>advocating (his writings may tell us). In early tonal<br/>compositions of Western Europe -- and 1679 is within the epoch<br/>where traditional modal and new tonal concepts are both very much<br/>in the air -- minor is often written with a &quot;Dorian&quot; signature,<br/>with no flat for the sixth degree. Werckmeister remarks this kind<br/>of new tonality mixes together a little Dorian and a bit of<br/>Aeolian, so the matter of a signature could be seen as left open.</p><p>The quick Googling I&apos;ve been able to do indicates that Diletsky<br/>advocated the adoption of Venetian polychoral polyphony to a<br/>Ukrainian or Russian milieu, an integration he notably achieved<br/>in his own compositions. For Giovanni Gabrieli, at any rate, the<br/>&quot;First Mode&quot; was D Dorian in its authentic form.</p><p>The motif A-F-D-A-D and its transposed counterparts --<br/>e.g. D-Bb-G-D-G in position 2 (G Dorian or minor) -- may point to<br/>a theme of Zarlino (1558 and later) as well as Johannes Lippius:<br/>the importance of the division of the fifth in influencing the<br/>affect or emotional quality of a mode. If the division is<br/>harmonic (string ratios 15:12:10, partials 4:5:6), then the<br/>quality will be bright and cheerful. If, as here with D-F-A, it<br/>is arithmetic (6:5:4, or partials 10:12:15), it will be more sad<br/>or gentle.</p><p>While this contrast became a feature of the major/minor system,<br/>it is also a feature of 16th-17th century modality, whose<br/>exponents such as Zarlino and Lippius speak of _armonia perfetta_<br/>(&quot;perfect harmony&quot;) or the _trias harmonica_ (&quot;harmonic triad&quot;)<br/>as having these differing qualities depending on the division.</p><p>As Joel Lester remarks in his study _Between Modes and Keys_,<br/>17th-century compositions may communicate a &quot;modality&quot; or<br/>&quot;tonality&quot; which is largely in the eyes and ears of the listener;<br/>but theoretical concepts of the period give hints as to the<br/>viewpoints of the era itself. Diletsky&apos;s theory obviously might<br/>serve this purpose.</p><p>For now, I&apos;ll just suggest that the modality-tonality might well<br/>be &quot;D-something-or-other-with-an-arithmetically-divided-fifth,&quot;<br/>transposed to the other 11 locations.</p><p>With many thanks,</p><p>Margo</p></div><h3><a id=105749 href="#105749">ðŸ”—</a>Clint Goss &#x3C;clint@...&#x3E;</h3><span>1/8/2013 11:09:14 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>&gt; Might someone who reads Russian explain the following &apos;circle&apos;?<br/>&gt; <a href="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/d6/Diletsky_circle.jpg">http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/d6/Diletsky_circle.jpg</a><br/>&gt;Charles</p><p>According to my wife, who speaks fluent modern Russian, this Â“Looks  like old church Russian that my dad would have known how to<br/>readÂ” Â…</p><p>-- Clint Goss<br/>    Quick Links:<br/>*  &lt;<a href="http://visitor.r20.constantcontact.com/d.jsp?llr=5c86ktjab&p=oi&m=1109824302174">http://visitor.r20.constantcontact.com/d.jsp?llr=5c86ktjab&p=oi&m=1109824302174</a>&gt; Join Clint and VeraÂ’s Native Flute list<br/>*  &lt;<a href="http://www.flutehaven.com/">http://www.flutehaven.com/</a>&gt; Flute Haven (Native Flute School Â– Sept 10-15, 2013 Â– Phoenixville, PA)<br/>*  &lt;<a href="http://www.flutopedia.com/">http://www.flutopedia.com/</a>&gt; Flutopedia  (Native Flute encyclopedia)<br/>*  &lt;<a href="http://www.goss.com/">http://www.goss.com/</a>&gt; <a href="http://Goss.com">Goss.com</a>  (index of all our web sites)</p></div>
