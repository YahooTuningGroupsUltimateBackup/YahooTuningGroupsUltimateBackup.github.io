It&apos;s Ives the<br/>consummate phantasmagorical experimentalist and Ives the great<br/>Nature mystic. In this arrangement I tried to push some of the mind-<br/>altering mysticism and wonder to extremes, but in doing so I also<br/>found myself sidestepping a lot of things I loved, like the achingly<br/>beautiful, murmuring whispers. It was a calculated risk, but I<br/>couldn&apos;t match (and wouldn&apos;t care to try) Ives own vision, so I<br/>consciously tried to find something different within the parameters<br/>of this amazing piece . I tried to takes Ives&apos; polychromatic prism<br/>and turn its focus on mixing intonation systems. In this regard this<br/>arrangement was a kind of watershed for me, and it really altered<br/>the approach I&apos;d use on most all the music I composed thereafter .</p><p><a href="http://zebox.com/daniel_anthony_stearns/">http://zebox.com/daniel_anthony_stearns/</a><br/>The Housatonic at Stockbridge</p><p>daniel stearns<br/><a href="http://kronoson.station185.com/kronosonic/contrib/dan.htm">http://kronoson.station185.com/kronosonic/contrib/dan.htm</a></p></div><h3><a id=60744 href="#60744">ðŸ”—</a>Jon Szanto &#x3C;jszanto@cox.net&#x3E;</h3><span>9/24/2005 8:33:44 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Well, it&apos;s *Dan*!</p><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;daniel_anthony_stearns&quot;<br/>&lt;daniel_anthony_stearns@y...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt; Written nearly a hundred years ago in 1908, The Housatonic at<br/>&gt; Stockbridge is one of my favorite Ives&apos; pieces.

Been very busy (been to eastern Europe, the woods, music<br/>music and music) and have been laying low from the internet for<br/>quite some time, but it&apos;s nice to &quot;hear&quot; your voice . Ives... what<br/>can I say, he talked the talk and he walked the walk . He&apos;s not for<br/>everyone, but he certainly did it for me... one for the ages. BTW,<br/>one trick pony is a pretty nice movie featuring Paul Simon at his<br/>melancholic, &quot;still crazy after all these years&quot; best .Take care and<br/>I hope you&apos;re well,<br/>daniel</p><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;Jon Szanto&quot; &lt;jszanto@c...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt; Well, it&apos;s *Dan*!<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; --- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;daniel_anthony_stearns&quot;<br/>&gt; &lt;daniel_anthony_stearns@y...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt; &gt; Written nearly a hundred years ago in 1908, The Housatonic at<br/>&gt; &gt; Stockbridge is one of my favorite Ives&apos; pieces.
