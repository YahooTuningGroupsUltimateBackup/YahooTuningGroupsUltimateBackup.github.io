IIRC, Dave gave me<br/>&gt; a nice definition a while back but i didn&apos;t get the chance to<br/>&gt; add it to the Dicionary.  any help on this now would be appreciated.</p><p>a microtemperament is a temperament with really small deviations from<br/>ji in the consonant intervals. dave keenan had some pretty detailed<br/>criteria on how much error the temperament could impart to intervals<br/>of each odd limit -- it would be best to ask him.</p><p>&gt; &gt; My impression was that it was a temperament designed to<br/>*facilitate*<br/>&gt; &gt; Just Intonation, specifically.  Is that correct??<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; So, in a way, it&apos;s what Margo was doing in her recent<br/>&gt; &gt; &quot;tempered&quot; just scale??<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; The idea being, if I&apos;m correct, that with microtemperament<br/>&gt; &gt; one actually arrives at *more* close to just intervals than<br/>&gt; &gt; in a pure just system?? Is that right?</p><p>of course. this is true of temperaments in general.</p><p>&gt; a microtemperament is designed to *approximate* Just Intonation,<br/>&gt; by providing intervals that are only very slightly deviant from<br/>&gt; the JI ratios, and at the same time to maximize the number of<br/>&gt; approximations that some imaginary &quot;ideal&quot; listener would find<br/>&gt; recognizable as the JI ratio.</p><p>i would substitute the word &quot;intervals&quot; for the word &quot;approximations&quot;<br/>and the word &quot;a&quot; for the word &quot;the&quot; above.</p><p>&gt; each microtemperment interval<br/>&gt; would be recognizable as two or more JI ratios.</p><p>huh? i don&apos;t see that at all.</p><p>&gt; unfortunately, i haven&apos;t had to the time to study either Margo&apos;s<br/>&gt; or Pauline&apos;s scales, but would like to look deeper into both.</p><p>margo&apos;s scale used various complex ratios, rather than fixed<br/>irrational numbers, to come up with the &quot;compromise&quot; intervals of the<br/>temperament. this makes little audible difference, but conforms to an<br/>old tradition of using only rational numbers. johnny reinhard showed<br/>me that kirnberger II was in fact defined using only rational<br/>numbers -- kirnberger split the syntonic comma in &quot;half&quot; using the<br/>ratios 161:160 and 162:161, and each of the fifths D-A and A-E was<br/>foreshortened from 3:2 by one of these &quot;halves&quot;. so the entire tuning<br/>could be expressed using only ratios, no irrational numbers. this is<br/>indeed &quot;just temperament&quot; but certainly not &quot;microtemperament&quot; since<br/>those two fifths were each off by a half a comma, 11 cents!</p><p>&gt; Pauline, i&apos;d like to see a more lengthy summary of the mathematics<br/>&gt; of your tuning -- specifically, what criteria did you use to arrive<br/>&gt; at a particular value for a pitch or interval?  is it fractions of<br/>&gt; some comma, skhisma, etc.?</p><p>pauline has said she is not a mathie. but it seems her system is<br/>nearly identical, in both measure and spirit, to the &quot;classic&quot;<br/>microtemperament that dave keenan discussed quite a bit -- the 7-<br/>limit planar temperament where 225:224 is tempered out. there are<br/>_two_ independent tuning decisions to be made here (unlike the _one_<br/>you have in a planar temperament such as meantone, schismic, etc.),<br/>and, if you like, you can express both of them (the narrowing of the<br/>3:2 and the narrowing of the 5:4) as fractions of the<br/>225:224 &quot;septimal kleisma&quot;. pauline herself does not seem concerned<br/>with pinning things down much finer than 1 cent, and i can&apos;t say i<br/>blame her.</p><p>&gt; &gt; However, this term would not be accepted at all by JI purists,<br/>&gt; &gt; correct, since they tend to see any *temperament* as<br/>definitionally<br/>&gt; &gt; *opposed* to the pureness of an &quot;unadjusted&quot; Just system...<br/>Right??</p><p>which term? i don&apos;t see anything in your (joseph pehrson&apos;s)<br/>terminology that could be controversial. you did say &quot;close to just&quot;<br/>intervals -- you didn&apos;t say &quot;just&quot; intervals.</p><p>&gt; but on the other side of the coin, it&apos;s interesting to me to<br/>&gt; consider an expanded type of JI itself as a sort of unequal<br/>&gt; temperament.  this is the approach i&apos;ve used in many of my<br/>&gt; JI pieces</p><p>&gt; -- for example, _3 Plus 4_, downloadable from<br/>&gt; the Tuning Punks page<br/>&gt; <a href="http://artists.mp3s.com/artists/72/the_tuning_punks.html">http://artists.mp3s.com/artists/72/the_tuning_punks.html</a><br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; and to my ears also Kraig Grady and Bill Wesley in much of<br/>&gt; their JI work, and from what Kyle Gann wrote, seems to be what<br/>&gt; David Beardsley has in mind as well.</p><p>do you mean you&apos;re deliberately using the &quot;wolves&quot; of the ji scale,<br/>since they&apos;re already rather mild?
