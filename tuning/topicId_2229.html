The 1691 treatise<br/>mentions the Orgel Probe throughout as having received much criticism.  The<br/>Werckmeister criticism of meantone and extended meantone must have roused up<br/>a ruckus.</p><p>Werckmeister wrote in 1691 &quot;Good organ builders are despised and the bunglers<br/>receive in some pieces, shelter and consolation.  A reasonable man who by<br/>chance gets a hold of the author&apos;s thesis or the abusing writings should<br/>confront then with my &quot;Orgel-Probe&quot;.  He will see how too much is happening<br/>to me and how my good intentions are misunderstood and slandered against all<br/>reasoning.  I am amazed how envy disavows that which the eyes can see, the<br/>ears can hear, and the hands can hold, and thus dares to suppress the truth.&quot;</p><p>The tuning for Werckmeister&apos;s &quot;our temperament&quot; is to refuse to flat each and<br/>every fifth as in meantone.  By tuning 8 fifths pure, and only 4 fifths flat<br/>so as to complete a full circle of 12 major and minor modes.  I suspect<br/>Helmholtz and many others through Western history confused the anti-meantone<br/>writing of Werckmeister with a pro-equal temperament advocacy.  To the<br/>readership of the time, it is likely the first time writing about a complete<br/>circle of 24 major and minor modes that took center stage.  The fifths to<br/>flat are C-G, G-D, A-E, &amp; B-F#.</p><p>Johnny Reinhard<br/>AFMM</p></div><h3>manuel.op.de.coul@xxx.xxx</h3><span>1/7/2000 4:43:39 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Johnny Reinhard wrote:</p><p>&gt; Werckmeister concludes Chapter 26 with &quot;Those who dare to make subsemitones<br/>&gt; on organs, instruments, lutes, etc. are stuck in a big mistake, act against<br/>&gt; nature, and want to be smarter than God.

Temp.: [snip] Werckmeister was a rather prolific author<br/>who published very regularly from 1681 until his death in 1706. During<br/>these 25 years he changed his opinions more than once. In the older<br/>works (1681-1691, to which the Musicalische Temperatur belongs) only<br/>unequal temperaments have been described explicitly. In the middle<br/>works (1697-1698) equal temperament has been mentioned as a possible<br/>solution when all keys are to play an equal part in musical perfor-<br/>mance. Since this was not the case, Werckmeister prefers unequal tem-<br/>perament, because it favors the common, diatonic keys. In his late<br/>works (1702-1707) Werckmeister is an unambiguous propagator of equal<br/>temperament because it makes possible unlimited modulation and trans-<br/>position as well as any enharmonic change of notes and intervals.<br/>With this information in mind, the divergent views on Werckmeister<br/>can be explained easily.

Temp.) must, nevertheless,<br/>not be seen as a book representative for the &apos;whole&apos; Werckmeister.</p><p>Manuel Op de Coul    <a href="mailto:coul@ezh.nl">coul@ezh.nl</a></p></div><h3>Afmmjr@xxx.xxx</h3><span>1/7/2000 2:07:49 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Hmm.

The evidence should be in<br/>_Harmonologia musica_ (1702), paragraph 27, p. 15-18.<br/>This paragraph is (according to Rasch) a straightforward<br/>plea for equal temperament, based on the argument of unlimited<br/>transposition and enharmonic exchanges. Moreover he points out<br/>the fact that the impurity of the consonances is just equal<br/>to the acceptable impurity: the fifth a little, the major<br/>third a bit more and the minor third even more. This is what<br/>you found also in the essay &apos;Does Well-temperered ...&apos;.<br/>But he goes on to say that in _Musicalische<br/>Paradoxal-Discourse_ (1707) W. has the same opinion,<br/>but goes even further to compare equal temperament with true<br/>Christianity, and seeks a theological foundation for the<br/>necessity of temperament. It is a very unsystematic work, full<br/>of allegoric indications of musical notions. A quote from<br/>p. 110: &quot;Wir schreiten weiter und wissen, wenn die Temperatur<br/>also eingerichted wird, das alle Quiten 1/12 Commat: die<br/>Tert: maj: 2/3 die min: 3/4 Comm. schweben, und ein accurates Ohr<br/>dieselbe auch zum stande zubringen, und zustimmen weiss, so dann<br/>gewiss ein _wohl temperirte_ Harmonia, durch den gantzen Circul<br/>und durch alle Claves sich finden wird.

Even Lindley and Barbour agree on this<br/>one.  Dutch scholarship on this point has not uncovered anything new to<br/>change this fact.</p><p>Barbour does a good job of debunking meantone for Bach, as well.  But he<br/>cannot connect Bach with ET in any direct way.  Perhaps Bach did not teach<br/>his tuning to students (maybe they had to develop their own?)  That would<br/>explain why Kirnberger begins his great tome on composition with his own<br/>tuning system, explained in ratios.  It is not Bach&apos;s tuning one feels.

D Major is<br/>practically ET and the music Bach wrote actually fits this fact in its scalar<br/>movement.  Now what instrument would be ideal to play perfectly in any key<br/>than the harpsichord?  Bach features the harpsichord which because of his use<br/>of chords gives off the most intensely lush sound.  Totally experiential.</p><p>Al has been trying different tunings for Bach and has himself been falling<br/>back to Werckmeister III.   It does seem that Bach had to be irregular<br/>circular throughout his entire life.  He was 55 when he taught Kirnberger in<br/>1739.
