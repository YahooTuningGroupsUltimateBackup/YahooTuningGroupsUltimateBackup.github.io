In my work with the prime series ratios, I<br/>found that as the column of prime denominators is moved upward, there<br/>is an interval at the beginning of each transposed series, which<br/>begins to slowly converge toward an interval approaching a 2/1. As we<br/>know, these ratios would never quite close at an exact<br/>mathematical &quot;2/1&quot;, but can achieve what would be audibly the same.</p><p>The magic prime series ratio which came within 1.427 cents of 2/1,<br/>was  1213/607 @ 1198.573 cents. This ratio was obtained from the 87th<br/>transposition of the prime denominators. Now, there were other higher<br/>ones that better converged toward the 2/1, but to include those<br/>ratios would have made an even larger, and perhaps unwieldy scale for<br/>the study of the Prime Series Ratios, so to keep things a little more<br/>manageable I let 1,213 Prime be my &quot;cut-off&quot; point. I ran the<br/>transposition of the prime denominators to 108 places, seeking the<br/>best convergence, and this one provided the most logical solution.</p><p>This gives me a large non-octave scale with 8,479 pitches, with its<br/>first interval above 1/1 being 1153/1151 @ 3.006 cents and its last<br/>being the 1213/607 @ 1198.573 cents. When we look across this vast<br/>landscape, we see many familiar faces, or perhaps, kinds of<br/>audible &quot;clones&quot; of intervals we know from comparing other tuning<br/>systems.</p><p>A really compelling and elegant property of the prime series ratios,<br/>(and the purpose of this article) that I discovered while exploring<br/>this scale has to do with applying the Classic Mediant function to<br/>ratios which neighbor directly above and below a &quot;target&quot; lower<br/>number ratio. This operation reveals an interesting and mysterious<br/>world of the geometrical relationships of high primes to lower<br/>numbered ones. In this case though, the results reveal a &quot;mediant of<br/>simplicity&quot;, rather than a &quot;mediant of complexity&quot;. That this<br/>function seems to work in a reverse order, when applied to complex<br/>prime ratios, becomes a valuable tool for analysis of the behavior of<br/>the prime series. This is something I discovered when I first applied<br/>the mediant function to the harmonic series, with and without phi<br/>weighting.</p><p>(i + m)<br/>-------<br/>(j + n)</p><p>Let us consider 8 ratios from the &quot;8,479 Tone, Prime Series Ratios,<br/>Non-Octave Scale&quot;, which neighbor around what would be the<br/>interval &quot;4/3&quot; @ 498.0449991 cents. Please note that 4/3 is not a<br/>member of this scale.</p><p>977/733   497.454<br/>1009/757 497.473<br/>1049/787 497.495<br/>1097/823 497.519</p><p>(Our target interval of 4/3 @ 498.0449991 cents, would fall here<br/>between these ratios).</p><p>1151/863 498.546<br/>1103/827 498.568<br/>1063/797 498.588<br/>1031/773 498.605</p><p>Now if we take in pairs, the ratios lying immediately above and below<br/>the target value; moving outward and stepwise, and perform the<br/>Classic Mediant operation on each pair, we see something extremely<br/>intriguing:</p><p>1097/823 497.519<br/>1151/863 498.546<br/>The mediant between the above ratios:  4/3 @ 498.0449991 cents</p><p>1049/787 497.495<br/>1103/827 498.568<br/>The mediant between the above ratios:  4/3 @ 498.0449991 cents</p><p>1009/757 497.473<br/>1063/797 498.588<br/>The mediant between the above ratios:  4/3 @ 498.0449991 cents</p><p>977/733   497.454<br/>1031/773 498.605<br/>The mediant between the above ratios:  4/3 @ 498.0449991 cents</p><p>Similarly, if we fix one ratio and find the mediant between it and<br/>the sequence found opposite the target value we get:</p><p>1097/823 497.519<br/>1103/827 498.568<br/>The mediant between the above ratios:  4/3 @ 498.0449991 cents</p><p>1097/823 497.519<br/>1063/797 498.588<br/>The mediant between the above ratios:  4/3 @ 498.0449991 cents</p><p>1097/823 497.519<br/>1031/773 498.605<br/>The mediant between the above ratios:  4/3 @ 498.0449991 cents</p><p>There are myriad of such connections that can be seen at this atomic<br/>level. And that there is some seemingly predictable behavior of these<br/>prime ratios being revealed by this process, is extremely<br/>fascinating.</p><p>One could go on to show that in many other areas of the scale, the<br/>above process will hold true. For example:</p><p>If we take the Prime Series Ratios lying 10 places either side of a<br/>6/5, we get:</p><p>181/503<br/>151/419<br/>We find the mediant to be: 6/5 315.641287</p><p>If we take the Prime Series Ratios lying 10 places above and below<br/>5/4:<br/>983/997<br/>787/797<br/>We find the mediant to be: 5/4 386.3137139</p><p>Now, as one would imagine, there is a point at which this breaks<br/>down. As you keep moving away from the target interval in this<br/>symmetrical manner, you&apos;ll reach a point at which it will no longer<br/>return the target value. This is to be expected.</p><p>As a matter of fact, if we look at the mediants between the Prime<br/>Ratios, which border the areas of many primary lower numbered<br/>ratios,we find a kind of rippling effect as we move away from center.</p><p>I wanted to see if I reduced the number of Prime Ratios in the area<br/>of the lower number primary ratios, if the mediants would extend<br/>further down the pairwise series. What I found was the opposite; with<br/>less Prime Ratios, there was an increase in the fragmentation. My<br/>intuition is that increasing the number would likely extend it,<br/>though I haven&apos;t gotten to this point yet.</p><p>What perhaps does this show us, what may we infer from it, and how<br/>may we make music with it? A few ideas:</p><p>1.  One can see that there is some orderly and predictable behavior<br/>of the Prime Series Ratios, which is revealed by the mediant<br/>function; showing a direct relationship to lower number primes.</p><p>2.  Ratios which produce the simple mediants may have unforeseen<br/>value as scale generators, because of their unique relationship to<br/>lower primary ratios.</p><p>3.  Powerful adaptive capabilities may be explored from these<br/>relationships, allowing one to use these neighboring ratios to<br/>achieve better consonance of chords.</p><p>4.  A dense spectrum of new rational intervallic variations and<br/>interrelationships become available, giving us myriad of new tuning<br/>flavors.</p><p>I have placed a document in our files section<br/>labeled &quot;mediants_PSR.pdf&quot;, which includes charts I made with MS<br/>Excel, to help visualize the mediants between the first 50 Prime<br/>Series Ratio pairs around 5 different low number primary ratios.

Your<br/>result *might* be mathematically interesting, but I can&apos;t see any<br/>musical relevance, because, putting it crudely, &quot;primeness is not<br/>audible&quot;. At least I know of no evidence to suggest that anyone can,<br/>by listening, distinguish musical intervals corresponding to rational<br/>frequency ratios whose numerator and denominator are prime, from<br/>nearby ones whose numerator and denominator are not prime, or indeed<br/>nearby irrational ones.</p><p>I don&apos;t get the point at all, of your insistence on using only ratios<br/>of primes (some of which are quite large) in your explorations of MOS<br/>generators. Your explorations of these generators are interesting in<br/>themselves. Thankyou for writing and posting them. But they would be<br/>just as interesting if you had simply used various numbers of cents<br/>for your generators.</p><p>On the question of the purely mathematical interest of your recent<br/>result, I would like to know whether the pairs whose &quot;mediant&quot; fails<br/>to give the most common value, actually *have* a mediant.</p><p>As Paul Erlich implied, a pair of ratios X and Y only *have* a mediant<br/>(or at least the special properties of the mediant only occur) if<br/>numerator_of_X * denominator_of_Y differs from numerator_of_Y *<br/>denominator_of_X by exactly one (plus or minus).</p><p>My understanding is that the classic mediant always gives the simplest<br/>ratio between two other ratios, but only if the above property (called<br/>adjacency) is satisfied. This property must also be satisfied for the<br/>noble-mediant (which gives the most complex ratio instead of the<br/>simplest). I think I failed to mention this adjacency requirement in<br/>Margo&apos;s and my paper, but mentioned it in subsequent posts in the same<br/>thread.</p><p>So I think you can actually just choose any pair of ratios on either<br/>side of a target (such as 3/2) and if they are both more complex than<br/>the target (complexity = numerator * denominator), and are adjacent<br/>(by the above test) then their mediant will always be the target.<br/>Primality is irrelevant, and equal distance either side of the target<br/>(in some series) is irrelevant. Yes this is a somewhat surprising<br/>property of the mediant, but well known I think.</p><p>Thanks for giving me the opportunity to comment.</p><p>Regards,<br/>-- Dave Keenan</p></div><h3><a id=18136 href="#18136">ðŸ”—</a>ligonj@northstate.net</h3><span>1/30/2001 7:26:26 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In tuning@y..., D.KEENAN@U... wrote:<br/>&gt; Dear Jacky,<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &quot;primeness is not<br/>&gt; audible&quot;.</p><p>Dave,</p><p>Thanks for your input on this.</p><p>I would like to clarify once again (perhaps you&apos;ve missed this while<br/>away), that I&apos;m not making any claims, either explicit of inferred<br/>about the audibility of primes.

No matter what the manner of generation, they<br/>are still *acoustical intervals*, and therefore of *musical value*.<br/>This I know from playing them myself.  Please note that Paul could<br/>find no difference with the acoustic thirds I produced, and only<br/>found difference with my method of scale generation.</p><p>Please consider if I had not mentioned the generative method I used<br/>and only revealed cents values, there would be no confusion as to<br/>whether there was any acoustical relevance to the goal of the tunings<br/>I used (as stated by Dave Keenan). It is the opposition to the way I<br/>generated these scales which has been pushed to the fore; then over a<br/>cliff. :  )</p><p>Oh, don&apos;t misperceive that I was upset - just trying to clear up the<br/>pointless inferences about things I never said or implied. Imagine if<br/>you had taken every precaution to avoid confusion, and then the very<br/>things you felt you had made clear on a number of things, suddenly<br/>became &quot;issues&quot;.

That is<br/>the ascribing of special musical or psychoacoustic (i.e. perceptible,<br/>even if only subliminal) properties on the sole basis that the numbers<br/>have special mathematical properties, or because they have special<br/>properties in other application areas (such as the visual arts).</p><p>Please forgive us if we are sometimes a little overzealous in this<br/>regard.</p><p>You have now made it clear that you are not claiming this for ratios<br/>of large primes as scale generators. But I think it is undersrtandable<br/>that we should think you were, despite earlier advice to the contrary,<br/>given that we&apos;re still not sure why you were expressing your<br/>generators as large prime ratios at all.</p><p>I guess you were wanting to see if there was any simple<br/>mathematical relationship between the numbers in the generator (when<br/>expressed as a ratio of large primes) and the corresponding generated<br/>Just thirds (or at least thirds expressed as ratios of small whole<br/>numbers).</p><p>I guess that we failed to understand that that was what you were doing<br/>because it was intuitively obvious to us (through mathematical<br/>experience) that there would be no such mathematical relationship. We<br/>are always happy to have our intuitions demolished by the facts (this<br/>is one of the most exciting things a scientist or mathematician can<br/>experience), but I hope it is clear that this hasn&apos;t happened in this<br/>case.</p><p>For example the sizes of generator (as a frequency ratio) at which the<br/>Just thirds appear (and the transition points between better<br/>approximations of one or another Just third) are all irrational. By<br/>choosing large enough primes one can always find a ratio of primes<br/>that is imperceptibly close to a given irrational. So there is no<br/>significance to the prime ratios unless they are always much smaller<br/>than one would expect for randomly chosen irrationals using the same<br/>tolerance. They are not.</p><p>Regards,<br/>-- Dave Keenan</p></div><h3><a id=18179 href="#18179">ðŸ”—</a>ligonj@northstate.net</h3><span>1/31/2001 6:38:05 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In tuning@y..., D.KEENAN@U... wrote:</p><p>&gt; but I hope it is clear that this hasn&apos;t happened in this<br/>&gt; case.</p><p>Dave,</p><p>As I explained to Dan today, the MOS scales were an afterthought, and<br/>I overtly sought none of what you said here in this post - at all.</p><p>Jacky Ligon</p></div><h3><a id=18181 href="#18181">ðŸ”—</a>jpehrson@rcn.com</h3><span>1/31/2001 8:38:02 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In tuning@y..., ligonj@n... wrote:</p><p><a href="/tuning/topicId_18060.html#18170">/tuning/topicId_18060.html#18170</a></p><p>&gt;<br/>&gt; Joseph,<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; OK, I&apos;ve listened to all of your examples and I think my ears<br/>prefer:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; 1.

Frankly, these are exactly the ones I preferred as well.<br/>The two &quot;final contenders&quot; for the tuning of this piece were the op<br/>de Coul 19 out of 31 JI scale and the 7-limit 19 note scale.</p><p>Ultimately, I chose the 7-limit 19 note scale for the piece, but it<br/>was pretty much a &quot;toss up.&quot;  The other &quot;cents value&quot; scales seemed<br/>to have more distracting beating in the sonorities...  Was this<br/>basically psychological, a result of seeing decimal numbers rather<br/>than ratios?.. Dunno.  Possibly, but I don&apos;t think so.  It seemed I<br/>was actually HEARING it.</p><p>A caveat is in order for all of this. When this study first surfaced<br/>on the tuning list, somebody remarked... maybe Paul, but possibly<br/>somebody else... that there was so much going on in this piece that<br/>it was really difficult to come to ANY objective conclusion about<br/>what was going on with the tuning.</p><p>Additionally, and this was the point that Manuel op de Coul brought<br/>up, the limits of resolution of the TX81Z, 1.56 cents (yes, of<br/>course, I don&apos;t know why I was thinking 2.5... it&apos;s not THAT bad!)<br/>would mean that the &quot;rounding factor&quot; could create discrepancies in<br/>the tunings depending on the particular frequencies that were<br/>required.  So, maybe, ideally, they wouldn&apos;t be quite as different as<br/>they sounded in this exercise.</p><p>Well, regardless, the point is that a process like this would not<br/>really be a scientific experiment, for better or worse, but it still<br/>would obviously be possible to listen to the piece in the different<br/>tunings and make a preference!  And, ultimately, that&apos;s the important<br/>part anyway if the point of doing it is finding an optimal tuning for<br/>a piece...</p><p>&gt;<br/>&gt; And very interesting to me, was that 19 tET sounded the most rough<br/>-<br/>&gt; wouldn&apos;t have guessed that!
