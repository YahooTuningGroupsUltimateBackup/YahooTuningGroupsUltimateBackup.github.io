In fact, 72-equal is actually 6<br/>different 12-equal scales transposed from one another by just<br/>intonation intervals!  The 72 scales only deviate from just intervals<br/>by two or three cents, so they are virtually just.</p><p>(I realize there is some dispute in how just is just, but let&apos;s stay<br/>out of that for one moment...)</p><p>Anyway, all you have to do is use your &quot;regular&quot; 12-equal scale with<br/>the following &quot;deviations&quot; to make 72!:</p><p>1/12th of a whole tone up and down</p><p>1/6th of a whole tone up and down</p><p>and the &quot;usual&quot; quartertones between your 12-equal pitches.</p><p>That&apos;s it!  Presto, &quot;instant&quot; microtonality!  (This will elicit snide<br/>commentary from the cognocenti...)</p><p>I highly recommend it as the way to go.</p><p>More information on the notation can be found here:</p><p><a href="https://www.mindeartheart.org/micro.html">https://www.mindeartheart.org/micro.html</a></p><p>And Joe Monzo, as usual, has detailed commentary on it in his famous<br/>dictionary:</p><p><a href="http://tonalsoft.com/enc/number/72edo.aspx">http://tonalsoft.com/enc/number/72edo.aspx</a></p><p>Good luck!

Much of the time<br/>has been spent going over all sorts of details and investigating many<br/>different alternative approaches so that we wouldn&apos;t be in a<br/>situation where we were constantly making changes to it after we had<br/>made it available for general use.  It&apos;s just about ready to be<br/>presented here on the main tuning list, so be watching for this<br/>within the next several weeks.</p><p>&gt; This is excellent news Gene and I look forward to the results as<br/>I&apos;m planning a set of 22 tet compositions for next year.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I hope that non-mathematicial musicians will find the final results<br/>easy to use and understand.</p><p>While the complete notation is very complicated (and hence very<br/>powerful -- there are around 25 different symbols to alter a note,<br/>not counting the direction of alteration and combinations of these<br/>symbols with sharps and flats), only a fraction of its resources will<br/>be needed for most applications.  For example, 22-ET requires only<br/>one new symbol (out of those 25), 72-ET requires three new ones, and<br/>217-ET requires twelve.  A 15-odd-limit tonality diamond in just<br/>intonation requires either 8 or 12 of these new symbols (depending on<br/>whether you are using the double or single-symbol option; the latter<br/>uses the same twelve symbols as 217-ET).  The remaining symbols are<br/>used for JI above the 15-odd limit or for some of the more obscure<br/>and/or larger numbered ETs.</p><p>One guiding principle that we have followed is that, even though the<br/>notation can get very complicated, it should never make it more<br/>difficult to do the simpler things.  It isn&apos;t necessary to delve into<br/>the underlying mathematics of the notation in order to use it.<br/>However, those who do so will immediately notice that the appearance<br/>of the symbols is closely correlated with the occurrence of prime<br/>numbers in the just intervals (or tempered approximations thereof)<br/>being represented.</p><p>I hope that this answers most of your immediate questions.</p><p>And thanks, Gene, for mentioning this; your timing was excellent.</p><p>--George</p></div><h3><a id=39042 href="#39042">ðŸ”—</a>Jon Szanto &#x3C;JSZANTO@ADNC.COM&#x3E;</h3><span>9/16/2002 12:35:56 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>George,</p><p>--- In tuning@y..., &quot;gdsecor&quot; &lt;gdsecor@y...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt; This has been going on for so long that at times I&apos;ve wondered<br/>&gt; whether there would ever be any end to our project.</p><p>Since they say &quot;all good things must come to an end&quot;, and you are anticipating winding up, it must be a good notation!</p><p>&gt; It&apos;s just about ready to be presented here on the main tuning<br/>&gt; list, so be watching for this within the next several weeks.</p><p>I would like to suggest something that, even if it were to delay the announcement a bit, would be worthwhile: please consider presenting a couple of pieces, in differing intonations/temperments, in the notation.
