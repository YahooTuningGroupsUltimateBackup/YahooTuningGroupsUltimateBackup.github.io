In fact I believe<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt;this has been done with 12-tET in this century.  Rothenberg&apos;s model<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt;still applies, to local events, but the usefulness of the model at<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt;this scale (ahem!) is questionable, IMO.</p><p>Joseph Pehrson wrote,</p><p>&gt;&gt;Isn&apos;t this &quot;anti-procedure&quot; what &quot;free&quot; atonality was all about at the<br/>&gt;&gt;beginning of the 20th century?? -- Schoenberg and others??  Of course,<br/>&gt;&gt;the &quot;freedom&quot; was costly, since there was a loss of organizing principle<br/>&gt;&gt;leading to the &quot;solution&quot; of serialization...  Yes??</p><p>Carl Lumma wrote,</p><p>&gt;Many of those works may do it, but the movement is not about it, as far<br/>&gt;as I can tell.  Rather, in Rothenberg&apos;s terms, the movement was about using<br/>&gt;proper inefficient scales.  In fact, many of the serial methods are quite<br/>&gt;bent on treating the 12-tone scale as a single perceptual gestalt, wether<br/>&gt;90% of the population could hear it that way or not.</p><p>Carl, I think you&apos;re agreeing with Joseph rather than disagreeing with him.<br/>He was talking about pre-serial &quot;free&quot; atonality, not the serial movement<br/>which was a reaction to it. Read the above again!</p></div>
