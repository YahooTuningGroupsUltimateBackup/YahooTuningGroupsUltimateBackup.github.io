I just want to mention that it is an entire coincidence<br/>that &quot;The Clever Mr. Zill&quot; posted to this list right before my post<br/>about his &quot;Introduction to Microtonality&quot; CD.  I had listened to the<br/>CD and went to the computer to make comments, and just happened to<br/>notice that &quot;Mr. Zill&quot; had posted to the list, which he rarely does.<br/>There was no other particular association other than coincidence...</p><p>__________ _______ ________<br/>Joseph Pehrson</p></div>
