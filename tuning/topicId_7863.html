Relaxation from strict vertical JI intervals when doing so reduces<br/>     total pain.</p><p>   . Extra relaxation for 7ths in 5-limit tuning.</p><p>   . Use of a &quot;utonal&quot; 5-limit tuning option so that half-diminished<br/>     tetrads contain a well-tuned (10:12:15) minor triad.</p><p>   . Drift control on a note-by-note basis.</p><p>   . Truly backward-looking in time symmetrically to forward.</p><p>The model is very tweakable, and I&apos;ve just made a stab at some<br/>reasonable coefficients.  Drift control is very tight, interval control<br/>is rather loose, and pitch slide control is perhaps a bit loose.  All<br/>can be modified for a different mix of tradeoffs.  Another change would<br/>adjust for those whose fine pitch memory is long-lasting.</p><p>This new model is capable of being wired to consider &quot;horizontal tuning&quot;<br/>of intervals beyond the unisons now included, but I haven&apos;t yet done<br/>that.</p><p>Is it smooth yet?</p><p>JdL</p></div><h3><a id=7871 href="#7871">ðŸ”—</a>Carl Lumma &#x3C;clumma@nni.com&#x3E;</h3><span>1/18/2000 11:43:41 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>&gt;Is it smooth yet?</p><p>While I wasn&apos;t one of the ones complaining about smoothness, I can say that<br/>this version is noticably smoother than the original, and noticably more<br/>consonant than the half-tuned method of a few weeks back.</p><p>-Carl</p></div><h3><a id=7886 href="#7886">ðŸ”—</a>Paul H.

The<br/>&gt;small drifts sounds very musical now. Then, at 2:44-46, the top voice<br/>&gt;goes up by what sounds like quartertones. What&apos;s happening there?</p><p>Paul, you are either blessed or cursed: your ear identifies and<br/>magnifies shifts.  A quartertone would be 50 cents, yes?  The actual<br/>shift at this point is more like 20 cents, but that&apos;s fairly high, no<br/>doubt!  In analyzing what&apos;s happening, I find that the program might be<br/>adjusted in several ways:</p><p>   . The melody (highest) voice should ideally be marked with greater<br/>     effective loudness, since it stands out.  That&apos;ll be a fairly big<br/>     change to my existing program, which distills everything into<br/>     &quot;pitch12&apos;s&quot; without octave information as a very early step in the<br/>     processing.</p><p>   . I&apos;m giving &quot;credit&quot;, the equivalent of volume reduction, because<br/>     several notes start at the later moment (2:45.436, to be exact),<br/>     and therefore am relaxing the spring that joins the melody note<br/>     (F#) across time.  Perhaps that credit should be revoked or at<br/>     least reduced.</p><p>   . In general, as you&apos;ve suggested, it may be desirable not to give<br/>     as much pain reduction to quiet notes as I&apos;m now giving; if they&apos;re<br/>     audible, they need good consideration.</p><p>   . It may be good, again as you&apos;ve suggested, to rank pain of retuning<br/>     motion non-linearly.</p><p>Thanks for your feedback!  I&apos;m both sorry and glad that your ears are<br/>so sensitive.  But, if I can please you, maybe the rest of the world won&apos;t<br/>be far behind!??</p><p>JdL</p></div>
