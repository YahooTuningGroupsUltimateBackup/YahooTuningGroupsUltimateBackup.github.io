But suppose a piece, along with lots<br/>of harmonically mandating chords, also has a bare glissando.  Here,<br/>other than grounding considerations pulling each scale degree toward a<br/>consistent point, there is nothing to block an evening out of the<br/>melodic steps.  Here, too, unevenness, when present, is most starkly<br/>revealed to the ear.</p><p>As with everything I do in tuning, it&apos;s a matter of finding the best<br/>tradeoff among semi-contradictory desires.

I think that<br/>negative spring coefficients would make the matrix unstable, however,<br/>because a node becomes pushed to one side or the other rather than being<br/>pulled toward the best compromise.  I guess you could get away with them<br/>if they were used carefully, but there&apos;d be a danger of the matrix going<br/>unstable - more push away the farther one gets.</p><p>JdL</p></div><h3>monz &#x3C;joemonz@yahoo.com&#x3E;</h3><span>5/13/2001 9:15:07 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In tuning@y..., &quot;John A. deLaubenfels&quot; &lt;jdl@a...&gt; wrote:</p><p><a href="http://groups.yahoo.com/group/tuning/message/22649">http://groups.yahoo.com/group/tuning/message/22649</a></p><p>&gt; Kyool.
