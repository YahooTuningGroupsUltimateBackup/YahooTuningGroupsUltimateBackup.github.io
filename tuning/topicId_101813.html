See <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cent_%28music%29">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cent_%28music%29</a> if you&apos;re unfamiliar with it. Everybody uses cents and cents are your friend.</p><p>&gt; Both definitions (below) are referring to two different scenarios. Very confusing. I believe it would be easier to understand if they referred to actual frequencies (&quot;A&quot; = 440 etc.) versus letter names.</p><p>There&apos;s nothing wrong with letter names. The interval C-G is 7 semitones, so it&apos;s 700 cents, and once you learn about cents it should be easy to convert that into a frequency ratio. The answer is 1.49830708. That means that whatever frequency C is, G is 1.49830708 times that. The specific base frequency you&apos;re using doesn&apos;t matter.</p><p>&gt; If anyone can please chime in and help clear up my confusion I would much appreciate the help.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; (Definition #1)<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; LippsÂ–Meyer law<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; The LippsÂ–Meyer law, named for Theodor Lipps (1851Â–1914) and Max F.

This is because an equal tempered fifth is exactly 700 cents, but a just intonation fifth is 701.955001 cents.</p><p>However, this article is not incorrect to associate C-G with the ratio 2:3, because the human perception of intervals is fuzzy and any interval within about 10 or 20 cents of 3/2 will be heard as 3/2. That is to say, if I play for you a 3/2 interval and then a 700-cent interval, the 700-cent interval will give you the same musical impression as the 3/2 - it sounds like a perfect fifth. The only difference is that you might notice a slight beating of the 700-cent interval, because the 3rd harmonic of the lower note is beating with the 2nd harmonic of the upper note.</p><p>The main point is that 700 cents cannot be radically different in consonance than 701.955001 cents.</p><p>&gt; This is a measure of interval strength or stability and finality. Notice that it is similar to the more common measure of interval strength, which is determined by its approximation to a lower, stronger, or higher, weaker, position in the harmonic series.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Source: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lipps%E2%80%93Meyer_law">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lipps%E2%80%93Meyer_law</a><br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; (Definition #2)<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Interval strength<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; David Cope (1997) suggests the concept of interval strength,[5] in which an interval&apos;s strength, consonance, or stability (see consonance and dissonance) is determined by its approximation to a lower and stronger, or higher and weaker, position in the harmonic series.

The just minor third appears between harmonics 5 and 6 while the just fifth appears lower, between harmonics 2 and 3.</p><p>This seems like a clear explanation to me. An equal tempered fifth approximates 3/2 and an equal tempered minor third approximates 6/5.</p><p>Another thing that might be confusing you is how you tell which specific just interval a given equal tempered interval is &quot;approximating&quot;. For example, the tritone, 600 cents, is close to 7/5 (582.512193 cents), but it&apos;s equally close to 10/7 (617.487807 cents). So which one is the tritone &quot;approximating&quot;?</p><p>The correct answer is, of course, both of them. Both 7/5 and 10/7 are less than 20 cents away from 600, and both of them are also simple enough fractions that they make an important contribution to the consonance of the 600 cent tritone (as opposed to, say, 41/29, which is too complex to matter). Thus we say that the difference between 7/5 and 10/7, i.e. 50/49, is a comma that is tempered out of 12-tone equal temperament.</p><p>Here&apos;s a table of all 12-equal intervals with their related just intervals and relative consonance:</p><p>P1 (0 cents): {1/1}, unison<br/>m2 (100 cents): {15/14, 16/15, 17/16, 18/17, 19/18, 20/19, 21/20}, strong dissonance<br/>M2 (200 cents): {10/9, 9/8, (8/7)}, mild (borderline) dissonance<br/>m3 (300 cents): {(7/6), 6/5}, consonance<br/>M3 (400 cents): {5/4, (14/11, 9/7)}, consonance<br/>P4 (500 cents): {4/3}, strong consonance<br/>A4/d5 (600 cents): {7/5, 10/7}, mild dissonance<br/>P5 (700 cents): {3/2}, strong consonance<br/>m6 (800 cents): {(14/9, 11/7), 8/5}, consonance<br/>M6 (900 cents): {5/3, (12/7)}, consonance<br/>m7 (1000 cents): {(7/4), 16/9, 9/5}, mild dissonance<br/>M7 (1100 cents): {15/8, 17/9, 19/10}, strong dissonance<br/>P8 (1200 cents): {2/1}, strong consonance</p><p>Ratios in parentheses may be too far away from the actual interval, or too complex, to contribute to its perception, but it&apos;s debatable.</p><p>For more about a specific mathematical model of this, read about &quot;harmonic entropy&quot;, for example here: <a href="http://www.soundofindia.com/showarticle.asp?in_article_id=1905806937">http://www.soundofindia.com/showarticle.asp?in_article_id=1905806937</a></p><p>My apologies if I&apos;m telling you things you already know, or answering the wrong questions, but as I said, I&apos;m not sure what your specific point of confusion is.</p><p>Keenan</p></div><h3><a id=101817 href="#101817">ðŸ”—</a>Mike Battaglia &#x3C;battaglia01@...&#x3E;</h3><span>10/16/2011 11:00:50 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>On Sun, Oct 16, 2011 at 8:44 PM, Wally &lt;soundmaker@...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Hi Members,<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I was brushing up on some composition skills today and ran across a term I was not familiar with.
