First C-G and E-B<br/>are pure fifths, reflecting some possible historical tuning practice<br/>and making the most used chord pure. That means the comma must be<br/>distributed over G-D-A-E, which is explained later in more detail.</p><p>Second, E-G# and Eb-G are slightly wider than pure, which also may<br/>reflect some historical practice in making G# a little less flat if<br/>used as Ab, and Eb a little less sharp used as D#. This modification<br/>is consistent with having the chords Bb-D-G# and Eb-A-C# pure (4:5:7<br/>or 1/7:1/5:1/4 respectively). C#-G# and Eb-Bb are thus only slightly<br/>flat (by 702464/703125, 1.6c).</p><p>The division of the syntonic comma in the pure thirds is by two<br/>factors of 224/225 (7.7c, &apos;septimal kleisma&apos;), and one factor<br/>3125/3136 (6.1c), giving the three fifths G-D-A-E nearly 1/3 comma<br/>each. The major third is divided into whole tones of 28/25 and<br/>125/112. The nice feature of the tuning is the way that the sequences<br/>F#-D-Bb and F-A-C# which start from septimal intervals slot neatly<br/>between the pure G and E, as if tempered.</p><p>The intervals F-G# and Eb-C# are exactly 7.02464/6, 6.1c sharp of<br/>septimal. Conversely Bb-C# is 7.0066../6 which is only 1.6c sharp.<br/>(Compare the meantone wolf minor third of 7.0094../6.) The wolf fifth<br/>G#-Eb is 28.9c sharp (cf. 35.7c in meantone).</p><p>Although pure septimal intervals were scarcely used in historical<br/>practice, this tuning is fully usable for almost all music for which<br/>meantone is suited, and is much simpler than the 49/32 method<br/>explained by Ibo Ortgies for just, almost exact meantone.</p><p>~~~T~~~</p></div><h3>Gene Ward Smith &#x3C;genewardsmith@coolgoose.com&#x3E;</h3><span>3/19/2006 12:22:10 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;Tom Dent&quot; &lt;stringph@...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I have no idea how original this is, but it seems to work out very<br/>&gt; nicely as an irregular 7-limit tuning for most repertoire which is<br/>&gt; suited to ordinary meantone.</p><p>You might compare it to certain Fokker blocks, such as pipedum_12f,<br/>from that point of view.</p><p>&gt; First the tuning, then the explanation.
