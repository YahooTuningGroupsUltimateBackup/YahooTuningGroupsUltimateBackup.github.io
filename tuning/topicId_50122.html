In the 5-limit, 12-et tempers out all product of<br/>81/80 and 128/125, and 15-et all products of 128/125 and 250/243; they<br/>have in common that they temper out 128/125, making the major third a<br/>third of an octave, or 400 cents.</p><p>In the 7-limit, 12-et tempers out all products of 36/35, 50/49 and<br/>64/63, while 15-et tempers out all products of 28/27, 49/48, 126/125.<br/>While this looks (and is) quite different, they do have in common that<br/>they both temper out all products of 64/63 and 126/125. These together<br/>give the &quot;tripletone&quot; temperament, which is most characteristic of<br/>27-et, and for which the 12 and 15 note scales may be considered the<br/>equivalent of the black and white keys.</p><p>I&apos;ve been using cents since this is a case where it makes much more<br/>sense than using the intervals themselves, particularly since the<br/>scale steps are in both cases integer amounts of cents. Here is a<br/>table giving the 7-limit consonances 7/6, 5/4, 7/5, 3/2, 5/3 and 7/4,<br/>their size in cents, and the corresponding cents values for both 12<br/>and 15. As you can see, the fifth is quite sharp in 15-et, but the<br/>major sixth/minor thirds and the 7/4 and 8/7 are much improved.</p><p>7/6 266.870906 300 240<br/>5/4 386.313714 400 400<br/>7/5 582.512193 600 560<br/>3/2 701.955001 700 720<br/>5/3 884.358713 900 880<br/>7/4 968.825906 1000 960</p><p>The Riemann-Siegal goodness values (higher is better) are 1.269599 for<br/>12 and 1.104057 for 15.

I think you will agree<br/>that although the idea of any kind of standard tuning is anathema,<br/>we&apos;re quite interested in standardising<br/>terminology/notation/nomenclature whenever possible, so we can<br/>actually understand each other when we attempt to communicate about<br/>various tunings. So saying we&apos;re &quot;anti-standard&quot; could be misconstrued.</p><p>Stephen,</p><p>In a forthcoming paper on the sagittal notation system there are two<br/>notations proposed for 15-tET. One uses the scale&apos;s best approximation<br/>of a fifth (9/15 oct or 720 c) between the nominals CGDAE, and the<br/>5-comma up and down accidentals for one degree either side of these.</p><p>C C/ D\ D D/ E\ E E/ G\ G G/ A\ A A/ C\</p><p>I expect this is identical to someone else&apos;s earlier proposal with the<br/>substitution of the specifically sagittal 5-comma symbol (which adds<br/>vertical shafts to the above slashes to turn them into half-arrows<br/>that unambiguously indicate the direction of pitch change).</p><p>The other one uses more accidentals and notates 15-tET as every fourth<br/>step of 60-tET (which is of course a multiple of 12-tET). Again, I<br/>won&apos;t be surprised if someone else has done this too, modulo the<br/>specifically sagittal accidentals which I can only crudely approximate<br/>with ASCII characters.</p><p>Legend for 60-ET notation (ASCII shorthand):<br/>A-G,#,b as for 12-ET<br/>y  fifth-tone up   (55-comma up)<br/>?  tenth-tone up   (7:11-comma up)<br/>j  tenth-tone down (7:11-comma down)<br/>k  fifth-tone down (55-comma down)</p><p>C C#j Dk Dy Eb? E Fj F#k F#y G?

I don&apos;t understand what looks<br/>like two different nominals for many degrees, with the same<br/>accidentals against them in some cases. I suppose these are alternate<br/>notations for the same degree, but they seem rather odd, being<br/>apparently a semitone apart.

Things that<br/>can not be understood must penetrate us, and that process requires opennes<br/>to the unknown.

I do not ask it to be penetrable.</p><p>This is not to say that only this one extreme should be represented.  But it<br/>should not be excluded, and I think the overall balance should not be<br/>judged, although it could perhaps be improved.  Clear explanations which<br/>require &quot;no previous experience&quot; are another side of the picture, and I am<br/>all for this.</p><p>Perhaps this list is oriented too much toward what is impenetrable by (to?)<br/>many, but that is only a part of the balance, and besides, it happens<br/>organically because of the &quot;critical mass&quot; inspiration shared by some that<br/>are here.

I suppose these are<br/>alternate<br/>&gt; notations for the same degree, but they seem rather odd, being<br/>&gt; apparently a semitone apart.</p><p>Dave, why are you not understanding this? It&apos;s exactly what happens<br/>in 15-equal sagittal too -- E=F, B=C, E#=F#, etc.</p><p>&gt; It seems most similar to the first<br/>&gt; sagittal notation above.</p><p>Carl should have explained Blackwood&apos;s desideratum, which (IIRC) was<br/>to have the 15-equal augmented triads, since they have the same<br/>intervals as 12-equal augmented triads, to be spelled the way 12-<br/>equal augmented triads would be most commonly spelled. This is the<br/>part of Blackwood&apos;s notation system that comes into direct conflict<br/>with sagittal (or any &quot;&apos;consistent&apos;&quot;) notation, and shows Blackwood&apos;s<br/>desire to cling to as many 12-equal habits as he could.</p></div><h3>Dave Keenan &#x3C;d.keenan@bigpond.net.au&#x3E;</h3><span>12/30/2003 3:21:53 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;Paul Erlich&quot; &lt;paul@s...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt; Dave, why are you not understanding this?
