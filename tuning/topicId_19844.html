However, maybe not so good for<br/>an overview of the whole thing and what to include or leave out, and so<br/>forth.</p><p>He is always getting into vigorous discussions with other list posters,<br/>which is fine, and gets everyone thinking a lot, but perhaps not the sort<br/>of thing one needs in an editor of a FAQ. For some kinds of<br/>editing it would be fine too, sometimes one needs a clear structure<br/>and a single thread running through the whole thing, say, for a microtonal<br/>text book, to take one example.</p><p>However, for this particular one, I&apos;m not so sure. I think we want<br/>a multi-threaded approach, to use a computer analogy. Otherwise,<br/>some interesting and significant points of view might get lost<br/>at some point along the line.</p><p>To take a recent example, how could he well edit the section<br/>on set theoretic approaches? Or even, sort out a suitable<br/>sub editor to be in discussion with about how it should be<br/>done, and to help him / her to get it into shape?</p><p>Since I&apos;ve been with the TL, I&apos;ve never seen you get into<br/>an argument with anyone, that I recall. Certainly not in the<br/>way Paul does.</p><p>Naturally you&apos;ll have strong views on things related to adaptive<br/>tuning, but I don&apos;t imagine that being a great problem somehow,<br/>and mostly that is to do with defending your own techniques<br/>against criticism - I&apos;m sure we can all agree that it is an<br/>important and significant section of the FAQ, and that since<br/>you are the main one in the field, basically you should do<br/>whatever is relevant for the Adaptive tuning FAQ entries,<br/>and field any newbie questions that need to be answered in<br/>the FAQ.</p><p>Hopefully if anyone else has something they want to write on<br/>adaptive tuning, and it is interesting and relevant, you&apos;ll<br/>be happy to include it even if it doesn&apos;t coincide with<br/>your own views, or even is critical of them? Even, work with them<br/>and help them get their entry into shape? I think perhaps<br/>you would.</p><p>There&apos;s not much at all for you to do right now, I agree.</p><p>Perhaps just wait a bit? Sometimes the ability to stand back<br/>and let things happen when there is nothing particularly<br/>needing to be fixed is exactly what one needs in the<br/>editor.</p><p>So, I still vote for you as editor, though if you want to<br/>abdicate of course you can! Maybe someone else will step<br/>into the role if you don&apos;t want to do it.</p><p>I rather expect Paul may agree, he wasn&apos;t that keen on taking<br/>on the role of FAQ editor, if you remember.</p><p>I did think he would be ideal because of his clear way of<br/>doing things, and getting things in order, but on reflection,<br/>perhaps that&apos;s not quite what we need for this particular<br/>situation.</p><p>Anyway, all htis is just a point of view, and somehting to<br/>think about,...</p><p>Back to work on the TL archive!</p><p>Robert</p></div><h3><a id=21376 href="#21376">ðŸ”—</a>Robert Walker &#x3C;robert_walker@rcwalker.freeserve.co.uk&#x3E;</h3><span>4/21/2001 3:44:23 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Hi John,</p><p>Glad you are staying on as editor / keeper of the FAQ.</p><p>Perhaps there won&apos;t be much for you to do for a while but I<br/>think we will be glad of it later.</p><p>I&apos;m going to have a go at finishing hte faq tree program,<br/>then maybe we can go on from there.</p><p>Robert</p></div>
