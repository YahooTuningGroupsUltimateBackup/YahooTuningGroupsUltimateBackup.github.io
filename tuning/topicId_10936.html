For neo-Gothic music, 17-tet satisfies this test very nicely<br/>with a bit of Sethareanizing or timbral finesssing. Indeed, I would<br/>say that the way that the unstable intervals of this tuning<br/>approximate a various of higher prime limits (11, 13, 17, even 23 if<br/>we want to go that high) may be one of its charms.</p><p>At the same time, 17-tet gives a quite nice approximation of our<br/>primary concords in a Gothic or neo-Gothic setting: the stable 3-limit<br/>intervals. It also nicely approximates relatively blending sonorities<br/>such as 6:8:9 or 4:6:9.</p><p>From this point of view, 17-tet seems to be an obvious choice for<br/>neo-Gothic styles; 22-tet is more of an alternative that &quot;pushes the<br/>envelope,&quot; and thus is well worth some exploration.</p><p>{After playing in 22-tet, and comparing it with 17-tet, I would<br/>generally still go along with the above: 17-tet is a more &quot;mainstream&quot;<br/>choice within the universe of &quot;Neo-Gothic&quot; tunings beyond Pythagorean,<br/>and 22-tet a more &quot;far out&quot; choice. Both tunings invite some<br/>Setharianizing -- or might one also say Darregizing -- in the matter<br/>of timbre, but here 22-tet may be a bit more sensitive than 17.</p><p>Since 17-tet is charming, and the extra &quot;unusual&quot; or &quot;neutral&quot;<br/>intervals can have an alluring and mysterious air when I want to mix<br/>them with the usual medieval ones, I&apos;m inclined to consider &quot;lack of<br/>consistency&quot; another term for &quot;variety.&quot;</p><p>However, 22-tet is fascinating also, both musically and<br/>intellectually, and with the right timbre, that temperament of the<br/>fifth by over 7 cents isn&apos;t as much a problem as it might look on<br/>paper. It&apos;s &quot;pushing the envelope,&quot; but with the right timbre, you<br/>_can_ have a scale with the whole-tone four times as large as the<br/>semitone and still make more or less &quot;conventional&quot; European medieval<br/>music. To borrow Easley Blackwood&apos;s terminology, the intervals can be<br/>not only recognizable but acceptable.</p><p>Using Blackwood&apos;s concept of &quot;R&quot; as the ratio between the whole-tone<br/>and diatonic semitone in a tuning (W/H, or in my more medieval<br/>notation T/S -- L/s to others), the &quot;neo-Gothic&quot; region might go from<br/>around R=2.25 (53-tet or Pythagorean) to R=4 (22-tet). Thus 22-tet is<br/>very important for marking a possible &quot;outer limit&quot; of this continuum,<br/>maybe a role a bit analogous to that of 1/3-comma meantone among<br/>historical 5-limit tunings. Both the tempering of the fifth by about<br/>the same amount in these tunings (in opposite directions, of course!),<br/>and the point where very wide major thirds tend to shade close to<br/>narrow fourths, etc. (a bit beyond 9:7?) may suggest R=4 as around the<br/>&quot;high end&quot; of the neo-Gothic zone.</p><p>Exploring various tunings within this zone is very important, and<br/>22-tet is definitely a &quot;can&apos;t miss&quot; destination.</p><p>To sum up on &quot;consistency&quot;: If you or others were to argue that the<br/>7-limit consistency of 22-tet gives it a special cadential flavor in<br/>neo-Gothic styles, that sounds like a good argument, and certainly the<br/>flavor can be very pleasing. However, I would want to emphasize that I<br/>don&apos;t find lack of &quot;consistency&quot; to be a flaw of 17 _in a neo-medieval<br/>kind of setting_.</p><p>Of course, for composing 7-limit music, 22-tet consistency would be a<br/>vital advantage.}</p><p>A curious feature of 22-tet is that it provides both the<br/>&quot;near-5-limit&quot; and &quot;near-7-limit&quot; variants of 24-note Pythagorean or<br/>Xeno-Gothic, but not any very close approximations of regular 3-limit<br/>intervals (e.g. ~5:4 and ~9:7, but not ~81:64). Since the 22-tet step<br/>is very close to 32:31, it isn&apos;t too far from 36:35, the difference<br/>for example between 5:4 and 9:7.</p><p>With 17-tet, in contrast, we get a kind of &quot;meantone-like&quot; compromise<br/>between the usual 3-limit and &quot;near-7-limit&quot; values in Xeno-Gothic,<br/>with the comma getting factored out; there&apos;s no 5-odd-limit<br/>approximation.</p><p>{If one wants schisma thirds in the usual sense of near-5-limit<br/>intervals, then either something close to Pythagorean or something in<br/>the 22-tet region seems to be the choice. Curiously, in 22-tet, the<br/>major schisma third is spelled as an augmented second (e.g. Eb-F#),<br/>and the minor schisma third as a diminished fourth (e.g. C#-F) -- the<br/>opposite of Pythagorean. Interestingly, the minor schisma third at<br/>around 327 cents is part of the 11-tet set. For most of the music I<br/>play, these are &quot;special effect&quot; intervals, and the usual ones the<br/>norm, and I tend quickly to get &quot;acclimated&quot; to minor thirds of 5<br/>steps and major thirds of 8 steps as the norm.}</p><p>In any of these tunings, a &quot;closest approch&quot; progression like M3-5 or<br/>M6-8, etc., involves total expansion or contraction of the unstable<br/>interval by a minor third, here in 22-tet equal to 5 steps (~272.73<br/>cents). We have a motion of 4 steps in one voice (the whole-tone) and<br/>1 step (the Pythagorean diatonic semitone, as it were) in the other:</p><p>   F#3 ------- +1 = + 54.55 ------- G3<br/>(8 = 436.36)                    (13 = 709.09)<br/>   D3  ------- -4 = -218.18 ------- C3</p><p>A cadential &quot;semitone&quot; of 54.55 cents is actually rather close to the<br/>size which the cadential &quot;diesis&quot; of Marchettus seems to imply, about<br/>half of a usual semitone (~45.11 cents in Pythagorean).</p><p>At the same time that we get something close to a melodic &quot;diesis,&quot; an<br/>unstable interval like M3 at 436 cents or ~9:7 still stays in the<br/>range of what might be considered clearer &quot;recognizablility&quot; than in<br/>24-tet, say (450 cents).</p><p>{Indeed I find 5/22 octave and 8/22 octave easily &quot;recognizable&quot; as<br/>minor and major thirds in a medieval or neo-medieval context and the<br/>right timbre. Maybe I should experiment with 24-tet or the like to see<br/>how I would react to 450 cents as a major third.</p><p>Also, I should add that in practice, having a diatonic semitone equal<br/>to the difference between a regular interval like a major sixth and<br/>its schisma version can have weird and wonderful consequences, a topic<br/>for more discussion.}</p><p>Out of curiosity, I used GNU Emacs Calc to see what would happen if we<br/>tried to use a 54.55-cent diesis in this way while sticking to a<br/>Pythagorean whole-tone of 9:8 (as Marchettus does in theory). In that<br/>case, since one voice will move by a 9:8 and the other by this diesis,<br/>we have a total expansion in M3-5 of ~258.45 cents. Subtract this from<br/>a 3:2 fifth, and we get a major third of ~443.50 cents.</p><p>Paul, you have a good argument that if neo-Gothic &quot;Mannerism&quot; is the<br/>intonational ideal, then 22-tet with its 4:1 ratio between whole-tone<br/>and diatonic semitone, as well as thirds and sixths right around the<br/>outer region of my &quot;septimal comma region,&quot; may be an even more<br/>dramatic expression of this ideal than 17-tet with a 3:1 ratio and<br/>thirds and sixths around the middle of the region.</p><p>{After hearing both 17 and 22, I would 17 sounds somehow more<br/>&quot;familiar,&quot; 22 more &quot;xenharmonic.&quot; In the Neo-Gothic zone, they are<br/>maybe comparable to 1/5-comma meantone and 1/3-comma meantone in a way<br/>for 5-limit music.}</p><p>Another issue, of course, is the fifths -- ~7.14 cents wide in 22-tet,<br/>as opposed to ~3.93 cents in 17-tet. A first crude reaction might be,<br/>&quot;Yes, 19-tet is off by more in the other direction, but that isn&apos;t<br/>necessarily an ideal temperament for medieval music.&quot; However, a fifth<br/>at 709.09 cents might have a new sound of its own.</p><p>{In practice, I would say that the kind of timbre I use for this<br/>tuning tends to smooth out the beats on the fifths, except maybe in<br/>the higher range of my keyboard, say the usual top octave C5-C6<br/>(c&apos;-c&apos;&apos;). It is more noticeable than in 17-tet, of course.}</p><p>This tuning might bring out the &quot;close approximations to 5-limit and<br/>7-limit, but not to 3-limit&quot; feature that I mentioned: thus we can<br/>play either a major third either as D-F# (~9:7) or D-Gb (~5:4, in<br/>effect a 22-tet &quot;schisma third&quot;), but without anything closer to the<br/>regular Pythagorean 81:64.</p><p>{Thus for medieval styles where schisma thirds are not an issue,<br/>17-tet seems a more obvious choice for a &quot;Neo-Gothic&quot; tuning of the<br/>super-Pythagorean variety with fifths tempered in the wide direction;<br/>but 22-tet has its own character, and serves as an alternative tuning<br/>among alternative tunings, so to speak. While the tuning might not<br/>have been intended mainly as Pythagorean-like, it amazingly succeeds,<br/>fifths and all. When it comes to large whole-tones, small semitones,<br/>and wide major thirds and sixths, etc., 22-tet may be indeed be a tour<br/>de force in theory and practice.}</p><p>Most respectfully</p><p>Margo Schulter<br/><a href="mailto:mschulter@value.net">mschulter@value.net</a></p></div>
