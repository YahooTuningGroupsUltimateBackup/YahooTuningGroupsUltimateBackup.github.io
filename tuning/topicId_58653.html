I suspect most<br/>&gt; people would prefer that it not be given a strict mathematical<br/>&gt; definition, which of course would also require stating whether it was<br/>&gt; a set, and if so, a set of what.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Well I&apos;m game to suggest a definition of scale, as a point<br/>&gt; for discussion, mainly to show up the difficulties.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; How about - a scale is an infinite countable unordered<br/>&gt; subset of the positive reals which must have 1 as a<br/>&gt; member.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Then if someone says that scales are usually finite<br/>&gt; - well that is because you usually give them an<br/>&gt; interval of repetition. So what you have there<br/>&gt; isn&apos;t a scale as such, but a scale generator.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; A bit like saying<br/>&gt; Here are the natural numbers:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; 1, 2, 3, 4, ...<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; But you  haven&apos;t written them all down of course.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Here is a scale<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; 1/1 9/8 5/4 4/3 3/2 5/3 15/8 2/1 ...<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; It&apos;s just that normally we leave out the<br/>&gt; ... as &quot;understood&quot;. There the method we<br/>&gt; are using to generate the scale uses<br/>&gt; a particular ordering, and of course<br/>&gt; has to because that&apos;s how it works.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; However, the scale we<br/>&gt; are using it to generate doesn&apos;t have<br/>&gt; to be thought of as ordered in that<br/>&gt; way - the same scale can be<br/>&gt; ordered in whatever way we please.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; So<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; 1/1 4/3 3/2 9/8 5/4 5/3 15/8 2/1 ...<br/>&gt; would also generate the same scale<br/>&gt; and if anyone wants to use that ordering<br/>&gt; or whatever ordering they please, then fine.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; That then avoids the problem of getting into such<br/>&gt; things as intervals of equivalence and the question<br/>&gt; of how to treat non octave scales, or all<br/>&gt; the different types of scales there could be<br/>&gt; - any kind of scale is allowed by this definition<br/>&gt; and you don&apos;t need to enumerate them in advance.<br/>&gt; It means someone can come up with some completely<br/>&gt; new kind of scale construction idea and so long as<br/>&gt; it generates countably many positive numbers<br/>&gt; then it is included in our mathematical definition<br/>&gt; so we won&apos;t need to keep updating our definition<br/>&gt; to take account of new scale construction ideas.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; It does have a bit of a drawback though because<br/>&gt; you might want to allow a range of values<br/>&gt; for an element in a scale.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; More generally, maybe a scale should be<br/>&gt; regarded as a set of line segments rather<br/>&gt; than a set of points. Normally each line<br/>&gt; segment is of zero length so you lose nothing<br/>&gt; by treating them as points. But they can<br/>&gt; be of non zero length corresponding to a<br/>&gt; range of values. Someone might want to go<br/>&gt; further and say that each line segment<br/>&gt; should also have a weighting attached to<br/>&gt; it so that e.g. the line segment around<br/>&gt; 3/2 might have 3/2 itself as the most<br/>&gt; 3/2 like interval, and then tail off<br/>&gt; quite rapidly to either side so that<br/>&gt; say 50 cents flat or sharp is very low<br/>&gt; probability or zero probability 3/2<br/>&gt; (in some particular context).<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; But the one around 5/4 might have<br/>&gt; a more slowly tapered weighting so that<br/>&gt; even an 11/9 or 14/11 is within the<br/>&gt; range of possible 5/4s.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; What is your idea about defining a scale<br/>&gt; so that its notes are logarithmically<br/>&gt; discrete?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Robert<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;</p></div>
