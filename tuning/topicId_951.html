I don&apos;t think they have<br/>&apos;nothing&apos; to do with music -- I do think they can have<br/>a relationship with music. But I suspect that they are<br/>not very useful as a compositional aid, or at least as<br/>not as useful as would be impiled from the number of<br/>them I have seen and the excited murmuring that follows<br/>each new diagram. As a theory aid, yes, sure! Very nice<br/>for that. And artistically very interesting. Many of<br/>them quite pretty. I still remember the excitment over<br/>Joe&apos;s pet, Sparky the one-legged Robot.</p><p>As an example of their danger, Sparky is a good<br/>example. Joe had come up with or found a tuning that he<br/>liked but then when Paul showed Joe that the lattice<br/>looked like a one-legged robot, Joe abondoned his<br/>&apos;crippled&apos; child. A sad day in the annals of<br/>microtonality and composition. That one leggedness may<br/>have been the most exciting part of the tuning.</p><p>I believe these sorts of events are the sorts of<br/>reasons that many of us have serious problems with the<br/>attention paid to lattices and some of the math and<br/>theory focus. Yes, in theoory, the theorists and<br/>composers will come together in our glorious ego-free<br/>tuning utopia. But in practice I myself and Jacky and<br/>Brian see people being oppressed by the theory heads<br/>who don&apos;t write much music. They post a lot and novices<br/>to microtonality get intimidated by them and never<br/>produce. If they did produce, if the theory really was<br/>inspiring and helpful, we would now, seven years into<br/>the tuning list and decades or centuries into alternate<br/>tunings, have a giant body of fantastic microtonal<br/>music to draw from and be inspired by. But instead, the<br/>music we have that is interesting and enjoyable sooms<br/>to mostly come from those of the &apos;practical&apos; bent and<br/>not the &apos;theoretical&apos; bent. But even so, in listening<br/>to some of the classical music examples on a page<br/>mentioned earlier, played on my Quciktime softsynth in<br/>12tET, I have to admit that I find these works much<br/>better composecr and far more interesting and having a<br/>deeper and more profound emotional and spiritual impact<br/>than just abmout anything I have heard in the<br/>microtonal field. Not to say that I don&apos;t greatly enjoy<br/>many modern works, but the real fact here is that Bach<br/>and Beethoven and Chopin etc were real composers who<br/>wrote great music that sounds fantastic even on a cheap<br/>sound engine playing in 12tET and which has simply not<br/>been surpassed. Of course they didn&apos;t watch TV or play<br/>video games. Bach was known to walk for days to try out<br/>a new organ. I guess he didn&apos;t have a drivers license.</p><p>Let&apos;s look at this group here. Jacky is clearly, by a<br/>factor of TEN or a HUNDRED or a THOUSAND times better<br/>composer than any of us here.</p><p>He stopped watching TV when he was 18.</p><p>And he tries to stay off the internet and go for walks<br/>in nature.</p><p>If you guys are serious about this music stuff you need<br/>to get serious about it and stop screwing around with<br/>your lives.</p><p>Smash your damn TV sets with a sledgehammer if need be,<br/>cancel your $35/month cable services (that will give<br/>you plenty of cash to buy equipment to those of you who<br/>can&apos;t write music because no one will give you free<br/>equipment and you are starving though you can afford<br/>cable TV and bottled water deliveries and imported<br/>cheeses)</p><p>Dillentantes!! Awake from your TV dreamlands and start<br/>living your lives! They are short lives as they are! If<br/>you do not enjoy music enough to actually DO something<br/>about it other than typing on the internet all day<br/>long, find something you DO enjoy and stop arguing with<br/>those of us who ARE doing things!</p><p>Get out of your houses!</p><p>Plant some tomatoes or basil!</p><p>Smash your TVs!</p><p>Cancel your newspaper/propaganda subscriptions!</p><p>Get rid of your gas-guzzling SUVs and stop crusing<br/>around aimlessly looking for the government funded free<br/>sex-change clinics!</p><p>Did I say -- SMASH YOUR TVs!!</p><p>SMASH YOUR TVs!!</p><p>SMASH YOUR TVs!!</p><p>SMASH YOUR TVs!!</p><p>Find something you enjoy and do it. Something that is<br/>productive! Not sitting in a cave talking about the<br/>shadows your see of yourselves flickering on the wall!<br/>GET OUT OF THE CAVE!!!!</p><p>- Jeff</p></div>
