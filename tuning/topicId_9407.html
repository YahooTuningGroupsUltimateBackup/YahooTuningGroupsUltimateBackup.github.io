Forgive me if this is redundant; my ISP had trouble<br/>with my account over the weekend.</p><p>The General MIDI standard default setting for pitch bend is +/-1 equal tempered whole step of pitch<br/>variation, or about +/-200 cents, depending on the resolution of the particular engine.  Since the<br/>MIDI pitch bend scale apparently has 14-bit resolution, equal to 16,384 increments, you&apos;ve got a<br/>range of -8191 to +8192 to work with.  Dividing 8192 by 200 cents we get 40.96 increments per<br/>cent.  Even though very few synths offer that degree of actual pitch resolution, it does seem to be<br/>safe to use that figure to calculate the amount of pitch bend in MIDI files for playback on GM<br/>synths.  That should get you as close to the mark as each particular instrument is capable of<br/>being, mostly within 1 cent.</p><p>--<br/>David J.
