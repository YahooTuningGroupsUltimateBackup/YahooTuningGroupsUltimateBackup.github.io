An important part of the world does it through the equal &lt; tempered. No doubt that you know that this arithmetical scale is imperfect so I won&acute;t mention its slight but                &lt; detectable imperfections. I transcribe here the opinions of some composers and musicians:</p><p>---------------------------------</p><p>W.T. Bartholomew &quot;Acoustics of Music&quot; (Page 183)</p><p>&quot;Although musicians often repeat glibly that tempered scale is imperfect, few understand the necessary cause of that imperfection, even with such works available as those of Helmholtz, Ellis, and many others. The cause lies in the mathematical relations of the ratios involved&quot;.</p><p>(Page 184)</p><p>&quot;In other words, a twelve-tone division of the octave is necessarily imperfect because of the nature of the number series itself&quot;.</p><p> (Page 185)</p><p>&quot;Equal temperament enables us to play equally well, or perhaps we should say equally badly, in all keys&quot;.</p><p>(Page 193)</p><p>&quot;Thus the &quot;tuning&quot; of a tempered instrument is in reality a process of controlled mistuning&quot;.</p><p>Joaqu&iacute;n Zamacois &quot;Teor&iacute;a de la M&uacute;sica&quot; (Pages 155-156)</p><p>Difficulties in the Tempered System</p><p>- &quot;Scientifically, it has no basis&quot;</p><p>- &quot;When considering practical inconveniences, there are none in fixed sound instruments, since even its harshest critics recognize that there is no substitute and accept it as the lesser evil&quot;.</p><p>----------------------------------------------</p><p>&lt; When I clearly wrote that my purpose is to resolve a problem that has existed since music was born, this phrase     &lt; definitely separates two concepts: the problem &quot;and&quot; the time when music was born. The problem is the presence &lt; of small discordances, inexistance of perfect fifths and fourths and other negative aspects introduced by the equal &lt; tempered scale into the music world. Most audiences do not detect the scale imperfections; if they have not heard &lt; better chords there is no reason to complain or to expect harmonious ones. I hope that you agree that the better    &lt; the scale is, the more pleasant the music is listened. Two separate although complementary concepts.</p><p>&lt; Who said that I found a tuning that can improve certain kinds of music. Nobody said that nonsense because poor     &lt; and good scales are unable to select the kind of music they work better.</p><p>&lt; I suggest you to stop your idea that Music itself has a problem. I alredy stressed the fact that I am only interested in &lt; the perfecting or replacing the equal tempered by another better scale.</p><p>Mario,&gt; The Piagui Musical Scale is not an invention, it is a discovery based on years of research on micro-consonance to resolve a problemthat has existed since music was born.Music does not have a problem. Maybe some tunings do, but the best music transcends this. Balinese and Javanese gamelans don&apos;t have aproblem. Georgian liturgical singing does not have a problem. North and South Indian musics do not have a problem.I&apos;m glad you&apos;ve found a tuning that *you* find can improve certain kinds of music, but please stop with the idea that Music itself has aproblem. Because, in fact, music is more than tuning.-----------------------------------------------------</p><p>      Para:<br/>     <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a></p><p>      De:<br/>     &quot;Petr Par&iacute;zek&quot; &lt;p.parizek@...&gt;</p><p>      Remitente:<br/>     <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a></p><p>      List-Unsubscribe:<br/>     <a href="mailto:tuning-unsubscribe@yahoogroups.com">mailto:tuning-unsubscribe@yahoogroups.com</a></p><p>      Responder a:<br/>     tuning@...m</p><p>      Fecha:<br/>     19 Jul 2008, 08:27:27 AM</p><p>      Asunto:<br/>     Re: [tuning] The roots</p><p>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p>      Mario wrote:xml:namespace prefix = o ns = &quot;urn:schemas-microsoft-com:office:office&quot; /</p><p>      &gt; ZC    = Zarlino comma = (81/80) = 1.0125</p><p>      &gt; ZS    = Zarlino semitone = (16/15) = 1.06666666..</p><p>      &gt; D     = Pythagorean and Just Intonation note D = (9/8) = 1.125</p><p>      &gt; EAZ   = Note E of the Aristoxenus-Zarlino scale = (5/4) = 1.25</p><p>      #1.

All the notes are separated<br/>  by 12cents. The meantone 5th is 696cents. The just third is 384cents.<br/>  And being decimal it can be adapted to all sorts of numerical<br/>  prestidigitations and jugglings. And no decimal points to fiddle<br/>  about with. All in all it&apos;s a reasonable way to approach microtonality<br/>  from a scientific view.</p></div>
