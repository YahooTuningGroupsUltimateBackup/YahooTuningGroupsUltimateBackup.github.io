Bach did not see the title &quot;Well Tempered Clavier&quot; in his lifetime.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;The autograph title page of the first volume (dated 1722) is &quot;Das Wohl<br/>&gt;Temperirte Clavier or Preludes and Fugues through all the tones and<br/>&gt;semitones both as regards the teria major or ut re mi and as concerns the<br/>&gt;teria minor or re mi fa...&quot; The Well Tempered Clavier is Bach&apos;s own title.</p><p>I always thought that too.

I can&apos;t remember where I read that, tho, so I&apos;ll take your word for it.</p><p>&gt;The idea that Bach intended to retune before each piece strikes me as<br/>&gt;counter to the whole point of the Well Tempered Clavier. Why would Bach go<br/>&gt;to the trouble of creating a collection of pieces in all the keys if not<br/>&gt;to demonstrate that playing them from a singled &quot;well tempered&quot; tuning was<br/>&gt;possible?</p><p>This is a good point.  I am not decided on the issue, nor do I lay<br/>awakenights trying to get decided, but...</p><p>There may be many reasons one would write a collection of pieces in all keys.<br/>Perhaps Bach, who probably had a good sense of absolute pitch, enjoyed<br/>hearing music in different keys.  WTC is first and foremost a method book,<br/>and maybe Bach wanted his students to practice fingering in all keys.  Maybe<br/>he just wanted to be complete.</p><p>Actually, what I&apos;d like establish first is: Why did composers of the time<br/>specify &quot;keys&quot; at all, even when writing instrumental works (where fixed<br/>tuning was not an issue)?</p><p>&gt;It is true that many of the individual works can be played in meantone, and<br/>&gt;may work quite well, but others are quite chromatic.</p><p>Indeed, and this could be the reason for the title -- &quot;These compositions<br/>require well temperament or extended meantone!&quot;  Rather than, &quot;You can play<br/>all of this in one sitting without touching the insides of your<br/>instrument!&quot;  The latter seems odd in light of the fact that we know Bach<br/>to have retuned during performance.</p><p>-Carl</p></div><h3><a id=6507 href="#6507">ðŸ”—</a>A440A@xxx.xxx</h3><span>12/1/1999 3:01:46 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Carl asks:<br/>&lt;&lt; Actually, what I&apos;d like establish first is: Why did composers of the time<br/>specify &quot;keys&quot; at all, even when writing instrumental works (where fixed<br/>tuning was not an issue)? &gt;&gt;</p><p>Greetings,<br/>    It seems that the &quot;Doctrine of Affections&quot; evolved into key character<br/>about the time that meantone evolved into well temperament.  And even though<br/>the meantones don&apos;t offer the shades of tonal variation that well temperament<br/>does, the keys had already been identified with emotions long before well<br/>temperament gave everybody a reason to &quot;prove&quot; it.<br/>     After 1700, there is a reason that funeral dirges weren&apos;t written in the<br/>simplest keys, and why the pastoral stuff was.  The reason could have been<br/>the growing use of the well temperaments with their very different levels of<br/>dissonance in their  extremes.  This certainly allows an argument for<br/>selection of key signature based on the desired musical,(thus emotional),<br/>effects.<br/>     A keyboard composer of the 17-19th centuries would certainly be aware of<br/>how the differing keys sounded in the &quot;new&quot; circular temperaments showing up<br/>on well tempered keyboards. Those theorists that proposed ET at the time were<br/>in such a distinct minority, and the difficulty of actually producing a<br/>credible ET so great, that I see no way to consider the use of ET for the<br/>WTC.  In comparison to any of the historically supportable temperaments<br/>of1722, Et really destroys some killer harmony found in the Prelude in C, and<br/>it certainly deadens the Prelude in C#.  Its effect is neglible in some of<br/>the middle keys, as they have their tonic thirds near 14 cents, as today.  On<br/>the extremes, it is another story entirely.<br/>Regards,<br/>Ed Foote<br/>Precision Piano Works<br/>Nashville, Tn.</p></div><h3><a id=6542 href="#6542">ðŸ”—</a>Paul H.

I meant to ask why Bach would have<br/>put together a collection of all keys if he didn&apos;t intend to show that they<br/>were all playable without retuning. Of course if retuning is available,<br/>then there&apos;s no reason why you can&apos;t transpose meantone to any key you<br/>want, and no reason why someone 100 years earlier couldn&apos;t have published<br/>pieces in C# major. They didn&apos;t, of course, because no one keeps their<br/>meantone harpsichord tuned for such keys. But Bach made a point not only of<br/>writing something in C# major, but each of 12 major and minor keys. I was<br/>saying that I could only imagine that he did so to show the possibilities<br/>of a &quot;well tempered keyboard.&quot;</p><p>&gt;My point to Bill was simply: before we use the titles of the pieces in the<br/>&gt;WTC to draw conclusions about Bach&apos;s tuning, let&apos;s realize that the WTC and<br/>&gt;Bach are not the only places you&apos;ll find keys specified in titles!</p><p>Actually, the preludes and fugues in the WTC are numbered, not named. In<br/>any case, I was not claiming that having a key in a title implies a certain<br/>tuning. I was saying that the title of the entire collection &quot;Das Wohl<br/>Temperirte Clavier&quot; definitely says something about the expected tuning.</p><p>On the question of key affects in the Baroque, there are no clear cut<br/>answers. It&apos;s true that certain writers -- Mattheson, Rousseau -- gave<br/>lists of key affects, but they often do not agree. I think this is due as<br/>much to the subjectivity of these assessments as to differences between<br/>French and German temperaments, for example.</p><p>In certain pieces, Bach writes in &quot;traditional&quot; keys for a certain genre --<br/>F major for pastorales, for example. However, this preference is often<br/>overblown, especially in the case of Bach, I think. For example, D major is<br/>often characterized as a joyous, celebratory key, and, indeed, many<br/>celebratory sinfonia and cantata movements of Bach are in D, such as the<br/>Magnificat. However, the original version of the Magnificat was in Eb. Why?<br/>Because in Weimar, where the first version was done, the local trumpet<br/>maker made instruments in Eb, whereas in Leipzig (and many other<br/>localities) they were tuned to D.</p><p>Thus Bach&apos;s choice of a key in this case was mostly practical, not<br/>symbolic. He wanted trumpets, so he had to accomodate their key. It is not<br/>inconceivable that our association of joyousness with D comes from the<br/>unrelated fact that it was the most common key for trumpets in this period,<br/>not from there being anything particularly special about the absolute pitch<br/>D (which would have probably been a different frequency then anyway). Wind<br/>instruments continued to be an important determinant of keys of pieces up<br/>to Brahms. Also, string players tended to play open strings when possible<br/>(the opposite of today&apos;s practice), so pieces in sharp keys would tend to<br/>have more resonant string chords.</p><p>That Bach often had no strong associations of affect with a particular key<br/>is also shown from the transposed pieces he included in the WTC, as some<br/>have pointed out. This is the reason that the first volume has a prelude in<br/>Eb minor but a fugue in D# minor. It was easier to simply add flats to an<br/>existing piece in E minor or sharps to a piece in D minor than to write it<br/>out again.</p><p>Of course Bach was aware of the different affects that non-equal tuning<br/>gave different keys, which is why he did not support equal temperament.<br/>However, even in his keyboard works, it is difficult to find many possible<br/>examples of those differences affecting his choice of keys, and I didn&apos;t<br/>mean to imply otherwise, Carl.</p><p>Bill</p><p>^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^<br/>^ Bill Alves                                      email: <a href="mailto:alves@hmc.edu">alves@hmc.edu</a> ^<br/>^ Harvey Mudd College                 URL: <a href="http://www2.hmc.edu/~alves/">http://www2.hmc.edu/~alves/</a> ^<br/>^ 301 E.
