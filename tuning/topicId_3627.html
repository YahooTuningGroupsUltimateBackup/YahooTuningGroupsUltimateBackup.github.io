Schulter &#x3C;mschulter@xxxxx.xxxx&#x3E;</h3><span>6/16/1999 6:37:07 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Hello, there, and I&apos;d like to propose a possible distinction between<br/>the early and the later compositions of Dufay (c. 1397-1474), whose<br/>career indeed seems to mark the transition from 3-limit to 5-limit<br/>harmony in much of Continental Europe.</p><p>Equally important, the problem of tuning Dufay (especially the earlier<br/>works) is a good reminder that keyboards are keyboards and voices are<br/>voices -- the latter not being bound to fixed-pitch schemes.</p><p>In my view, Dufay&apos;s earlier works (say 1420-1440) are still trinic:<br/>that is, the complete stable harmony remains the full trine, with<br/>outer octave, lower fifth, and upper fourth (e.g. D3-A3-D4). As with<br/>the triad in late 19th-century practice, this &quot;full harmony&quot; had by<br/>this point become not so full and rich as in earlier Gothic times; but<br/>the instability of thirds and sixths is still a vital element of the<br/>young Dufay&apos;s cadences, however pervasive these intervals may be in<br/>the texture.</p><p>(See Paul Erlich&apos;s excellent recent post on the tendency of both late<br/>Gothic 3-limit and late Romantic 5-limit music to become harmonically<br/>blurred as unstable sonorities become more pervasive.)</p><p>On keyboard, I would favor a &quot;modified Pythagorean&quot; intonation,<br/>preferably with 15 or 16 notes per octave (easy with a synthesizer<br/>supporting &quot;part-tunings&quot; for two conventional 12-note manuals, with<br/>one keyboard for example tuned Eb-G# and the other to the &quot;modern&quot;<br/>early 15th-century arrangement Gb-B).</p><p>The idea of this tuning is to use the true Pythagorean sharps (a<br/>16-note tuning could also include D#, although this might not be<br/>needed so often) for cadences where major thirds expand to fifths and<br/>major sixths to octaves, for example:</p><p>C#4 D4<br/>G#3 A4<br/>E3  D4</p><p>Where noncadential sonorities involving thirds or sixths occur,<br/>especially prolonged ones, substituting the Pythagorean flats for the<br/>regular sharps produces near-pure schisma thirds, e.g.</p><p>B3<br/>Ab3<br/>E3</p><p>If only 12 notes were available, I would go with the Gb-B tuning,<br/>which has all the sharps tuned as flats. This has the interesting<br/>effect of making thirds and sixths involving sharps (cadential or<br/>otherwise) nearly pure, but other thirds and sixths Pythagorean. The<br/>result, as Mark Lindley describes, is a kind of &quot;modal color&quot;<br/>analogous to the key color of 18th-century well-temperaments.</p><p>Please note that I&apos;ve been speaking here of the _early_ Dufay. Let&apos;s stick<br/>with keyboards for the moment. By around 1450, meantone tuning was<br/>evidently starting to influence keyboard composers (e.g. Conrad von<br/>Paumann). Dufay&apos;s later works, where thirds and sixths might be said to<br/>shift from &quot;mildly unstable&quot; to &quot;almost stable but inconclusive,&quot;  might<br/>nicely fit that tuning, as Lindley remarks in his article on &quot;Pythagorean<br/>Intonation&quot; in the _New Grove_.</p><p>However, going back first to the early 15th century, the question of<br/>vocal intonation is really an open one. A clue as to &quot;conservative&quot;<br/>practice during Dufay&apos;s youth comes from the Italian theorist<br/>Prosdocimus of Beldemandis, who prefers regular Pythagorean thirds and<br/>sixths, especially at cadences where these &quot;perfected&quot; intervals<br/>efficiently resolve to stable ones. A somewhat more modern perspective<br/>is provided by Ugolino of Orvieto, another writer of Dufay&apos;s youth,<br/>who share the views of Prosdocimus in favor of the wide cadential<br/>major thirds and sixths, but also notes the popularity of the new<br/>sharps-as-flats tuning.</p><p>One possible ideal for singers would be to seek Pythagorean thirds and<br/>sixths at directed cadences (which still often follow typical<br/>14th-century patterns in the early Dufay), but pure or near-pure<br/>thirds and sixths at other significant points. My 15 or 16 note<br/>keyboard tuning, in fact, is designed to approximate such a process.</p><p>However, singers are not restricted to 12 or even to 17 notes per<br/>octave, and even if we assume that they were influenced by keyboard<br/>intonations (a hypothesis cautiously proposed by Lindley), would they<br/>necessarily emulate all the fine points of such intonations. For<br/>example, while a keyboard sonority such as C3-G3-E4 would always be<br/>regular Pythagorean (only thirds with sharps sometimes or always are<br/>realized as schisma thirds), might not a singer tune E4 close to a 5:2<br/>in relation to C3?</p><p>Descriptions of the &quot;English countenance&quot; in Dufay and Binchois during<br/>the epoch of around 1420-1440 certainly provide a motivation for making<br/>at least some of the prominent thirds and sixths just in vocal<br/>intonation, and keyboard intonations may have both reflected and<br/>reinforced such tendencies. However, we cannot be sure that even in<br/>England _all_ thirds and sixths were necessarily intoned as in<br/>5-limit (e.g. in Dunstable); possibly the regular Pythagorean<br/>intervals were appreciated at cadences.</p><p>By around 1450, changes in cadences as well as the more and more<br/>consistently tertian flavor of the texture noted by Lindley do suggest<br/>something like 5-limit for voices; Ramos describes 5:4 and 6:5 thirds<br/>in 1482. Thus I would say that performing the later Dufay in 5-limit<br/>is a very reasonable historical decision.</p><p>Incidentally, some recent performances of Ockeghem have used<br/>Pythagorean, maybe as a way of making the melodic lines more<br/>distinct. While conventional wisdom would say that his music invites<br/>5-limit (or meantone on a keyboard), these experiments have received<br/>some positive reception -- and also some not unexpected controversy.</p><p>Most appreciatively,</p><p>Margo Schulter<br/><a href="mailto:mschulter@value.net">mschulter@value.net</a></p></div>
