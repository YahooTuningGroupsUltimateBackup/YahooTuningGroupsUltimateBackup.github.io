I have<br/>been working in virtual isolation for the best part of the last 30<br/>years and have only, with the advent of the Internet, recently come<br/>into contact with alternative musicological developments. I have also<br/>been deterred in the past because much musicology that I have seen<br/>has been &apos;ufological&apos;, pseudo-mathematical nonsense.</p><p>Now with regard to the 7th, I understand there are two defined,<br/>the &apos;minor&apos; 7th of 5:9 and the &apos;grave&apos; 7th of 9:16. My reason for<br/>working with the ratio 9:16 is that it is the reciprocal of the tone<br/>of 8:9, which is the &apos;official&apos; tone as defined by Pythagoras, being<br/>the interval between pitches 5 and 7, i.e.</p><p>2:3 / 3:4 = 2:3 x 4:3 = 8:9</p><p>The reciprocal of the &apos;minor&apos; 7th of 5:9 is a &apos;tone&apos; (whole step) of<br/>9:10, i.e.</p><p>1:2 / 5:9 = 1:2 x 9:5 = 9:10</p><p>There are two reasons that I insist that each interval be<br/>arithmetically paired with its complement. Firstly so that their<br/>product is a true octave, in the case of the tone and diminished 7th</p><p>1:2 / 8:9 = 1:2 x 9:8 = 9:16</p><p>Secondly so that the reciprocal view also holds true, the reciprocal<br/>of frequency being wavelength. Thus in terms of frequency, the tone<br/>of 8:9 translates to a tone of 9:16 in terms of wavelength.</p><p>Similarly, a diminished (or dominant) 7th with frequency ration 9:16<br/>converts to a wavelength ratio of 8:9.</p><p>All I have done is to make the tone (which I give primacy by virtue<br/>of its being the interval from pitch 5 to pitch 7) and 7th follow the<br/>same rules as every other complementary pair of intervals.</p><p>There is another reason, higher than Pythagoras&apos; arbitration in the<br/>matter, for using a dim 7th of 9:16 and this is what is demonstrated<br/>easily by the computer program about which I have spoke in a previous<br/>post and which may be downloaded from<br/><a href="http://www.odeion.org/atlantis/natural2.html">http://www.odeion.org/atlantis/natural2.html</a></p><p>This higher reason is that inclusion of the pair 8:9 and 9:16<br/>maximizes the number of correlative intervals and thereby the<br/>inherent aesthetic of the system. Substitution of any other vibration<br/>ratio in any position reduces the number. At its maximum, the number<br/>of correlative intervals is exactly 2/3 of the total number of<br/>relative intervals, which is sublimely poetical in view of the fact<br/>that dodekaphony is itself based upon the node (closest point of<br/>approach) of the two series of powers of 2 and powers of 3.</p><p>I have also realized that Pythagoras himself had acquired only a<br/>faulty understanding of dodekaphony. Dodekaphony is older than<br/>civilization itself (i.e. it is from before 4000BC) and this is the<br/>central theme of my work - that &apos;civilization&apos; is not the continuous<br/>progression that has been painted by historians. Now I realize that I<br/>myself here risk accusations of being a &apos;ufologist&apos;, however, I can<br/>demonstrate that dodekaphony is itself only a part of a much wider<br/>integrated system of measures and if you would read Chapter 2, on the<br/>subject of the Parthenon, you will see exactly what I am talking<br/>about.</p><p>Therefore I feel quite justified in correcting the textbooks.</p></div><h3>Carl Lumma &#x3C;ekin@lumma.org&#x3E;</h3><span>12/5/2003 12:11:23 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>&gt;From Sault&apos;s website I gleaned this; it differs from the Ellis<br/>&gt;Duodene by having a 16/9 in place of a 9/5.</p><p>Whoops, maybe I should retire!</p><p>-Carl</p></div><h3>Paul Erlich &#x3C;paul@stretch-music.com&#x3E;</h3><span>12/5/2003 1:54:50 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;Peter Wakefield Sault&quot; &lt;sault@c...&gt;<br/>wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; There are two reasons that I insist that each interval be<br/>&gt; arithmetically paired with its complement.

It is,<br/>however, an untested scenario. I would have to modify my software to<br/>allow such testing. Built into ODEION, the melodic generator, is an<br/>earlier version of Natural 2.00 (i.e. it is version 1.xx) - using a<br/>DOS panel. It&apos;s a good thing I have kept my old 486 and all my DOS<br/>HDDs.</p><p>As for ET, *all* intervals are correlative, by definition. Thus there<br/>is no preferred path through the pitches. Only Just Intonation<br/>possesses an inherent aesthetic, so far as I can tell. I can produce<br/>both ET and &apos;manual&apos; melodies with ODEION, for comparison, and you<br/>will find that ET gives a fair rendition of a cat on a hot keyboard.<br/>No one would call it music. I will produce an example, using the<br/>parameter Natural No.1 but replacing JI with ET. Then you will see. I<br/>already know what it will sound like - the word is &apos;ugly&apos;. *Manual*<br/>path programming can produce some nice-sounding stuff - it tends to<br/>be arpeggiations of chord-scales. However, it will auto-modulate,<br/>providing a little more interest than a single-key arpeggiation.</p><p>If anybody out there possesses a pure DOS machine, I&apos;d be pleased to<br/>supply a copy of ODEION to him/her. It will *not* work in a DOS<br/>window under Winduhs. One of the nice things about ODEION is that it<br/>will loop endlessly and seamlessly. No - it cannot be converted to<br/>Winduhs. Bill made sure of that - most of the action takes place in<br/>assembly language routines.</p><p>I also have another program called ODEIONPC, also DOS-only.

This was (and<br/>still is) the only way that I can dynamically retune a JI scale<br/>relative to the bridge note during a modulation, giving complete<br/>freedom to modulate to any key.

Our contemporary consciousness is a<br/>consequence of having been seeded countless millenia ago, before<br/>Sumer. Sumer itself, like the Renaissance, was a consequence of this<br/>seeding. You yourself put your finger right on it. The Sumerians did<br/>not have the technology to measure geodetic and lunar dimensions with<br/>the degree of precision reflected in certain ancient monuments and<br/>associated units of measure. So they must have inherited and<br/>preserved, as sacred, the units of measure which reflect these<br/>measurements. It is only because *we* have the technology to make<br/>similarly precise measurements that the geodetic nature and precision<br/>of the ancient units of measure is revealed. Moreover, the manner of<br/>dividing the ancient units into smaller sub-units follows the same<br/>ratios that we see in our tunings. Forget all the academic nonsense<br/>about the degree of angle being derived from the 360-day solar year.<br/>*What* 360-day solar year I have to ask. Our solar year is 365 days,<br/>not 360. The employment of a 360-day calendar, with or without<br/>intercalary, derives from the fact that 360 is a *magic* number. As I<br/>have demonstrated, it is the lowest common denominator of the<br/>frequency ratios of the natural dodekaphonic intervals and they are<br/>the derivation of the Babylonian unit of rotation, the degree of<br/>angle.</p><p>Now this begs the question - who did the seeding?

The Only Practical Solution... ...The system just outlined is<br/>that called, for obvious reasons, &apos;Equal Temperament&apos;.<br/>&quot;5. Bach&apos;s Support of the Solution. Because Bach tuned his domestic<br/>clavichords and harpsichords in this way [ET] and wrote two series of<br/>preludes and fugues, each series including all the twelve major and<br/>all the twelve minor keys, and because he made these two series a<br/>sort of public manifesto for the system by calling them (or, at any<br/>rate, the first of the two, 1722) &apos;The Well-tempered Clavier&apos;, many<br/>peopl have a vague idea that Bach himself invented the system; indeed<br/>this is sometimes stated by musical writers of good standing. It is,<br/>however, said to have been proposed by Aristoxenus (c. 350 B.C.) and<br/>to have been in actual use in China centuries before this (a<br/>difficult statement, however, in view of the fact that even in our<br/>day Chinese music uses the primitive pentatonic scale). The Spaniards<br/>seem to have used it in the placing of the frets on their guitars at<br/>least two centuries before Bach was born - to judge by the<br/>instructions in the &apos;Musica Practica&apos; of Ramos de Pareja, 1482; and<br/>the Italian Zarlino in the late sixteenth century, explains its<br/>application to the lute. Moreover, amongst the virginal works of the<br/>English Elizabethan composers, roughly a century before Bach, will be<br/>found two or three (notably by John Bull) that go so far afield in<br/>modulation as to show that some of these composers, too, must have<br/>used a tuning system on the same lines. The celebrated organist<br/>J.C.Kerll (1627-93) wrote a duet on a ground bass, passing through<br/>every key; this certainly seems to imply a use of equal temperament,<br/>and that such temperament was in considerable use at this period is<br/>proved by a reference in Mersenne (1636). In the harpsichord works of<br/>Bach&apos;s contemporary, Handel, will be found some little use of extreme<br/>keys, showing that he, too, must have had his domestic instruments<br/>tuned in something the same way. Mattheson in his &apos;Organistenprobe&apos;<br/>(1719) has a piece in every key. A little later than Bach&apos;s first<br/>book, the earliest pianforte music ever published, Giustini&apos;s Sonatas<br/>(1732), modulate to such remote keys as G sharp minor, so implying<br/>that their composer&apos;s instrument was tuned on the equal temperament<br/>system.<br/>&quot;Bach was not even the only one to write a set of preludes and fugues<br/>called a &apos;Well-tempered Clavier&apos;, and taking in all the major and<br/>minor keys. An early eighteenth-century composer called Bernhard<br/>Christian Weber did the same thing (for modern instances see Huber<br/>and Klengel, A.A.; also cf. Ashton, Algernon); and Beethoevn, in<br/>1803, published his op. 39, being &apos;Two Preludes through the twelve<br/>major keys&apos;, for piano or organ.<br/>&quot;As soon as instrumental music began to be developed and the modern<br/>scheme of twelve tonalities, all exactly similar in their intervals,<br/>to be dimly perceived as a convenient thing, the system of equal<br/>temperament became inevitable. The Flemish composer, Willaert, as<br/>early as 1550, had pleaded for such a system.<br/>&quot;It will doubtless shock some readers to learn that despite all this<br/>propaganda on behalf of equal temperament from 1550 onwards some<br/>great English piano-making firms of nearly three centuries later had<br/>not adopted it. Broadwoods did so only in 1846 (see Hipkins,<br/>in &apos;Musical Times&apos;, Sept. 1898), so that one may take it that up to<br/>that date none of their clients, if keen-eared, could play through<br/>Bach&apos;s &apos;48&apos; with any satisfaction, to say nothing of Beethoven and<br/>Chopin, with their many keys and free modulations.&quot;</p></div><h3>Carl Lumma &#x3C;ekin@lumma.org&#x3E;</h3><span>12/9/2003 10:43:16 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>&gt;Maybe you and I are &apos;more conscious&apos; than Telemann</p><p>Oh, I highly doubt that.</p><p>-Carl</p></div><h3>monz &#x3C;monz@attglobal.net&#x3E;</h3><span>12/10/2003 1:43:35 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>hi Peter,</p><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;Peter Wakefield Sault&quot; &lt;sault@c...&gt;<br/>wrote:</p><p>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; 1) Bach&apos;s WTC was for a well-temperament, not 12-tet.<br/>&gt; &gt; 2) If you play the &apos;Fitzwilliam&apos;s virginal Book&apos;, a<br/>&gt; &gt; renaissance manuscript, on a &apos;sichord in 12-tet, it<br/>&gt; &gt; sounds awful.

For the sake of<br/>the experience, to learn what can happen.</p><p>Much is possible when things are not polarized.</p><p>Please try to read the following without judging it.  Keep in mind I am<br/>trying to talk to everyone at once.  Many sides are ready to be offended.  I<br/>hold a vision in which there do not have to be sides.

This might lead someone to believe I am overall on a<br/>certain side.  Please bear with me.  Please trust for a moment.  It is not<br/>important that you trust me or that you know that I am &quot;trustworthy&quot;.  Just<br/>trust that you might hear something in this that may be meaningful and<br/>useful to you, and if so trust that you can learn from it even if it is<br/>uncomfortable to you.  No one but you can make that choice.  Likewise no one<br/>but you is responsible for what you learn now.  I can not influence you<br/>wrongly.  The choice is all yours.</p><p>In particularly please do not judge me for not accusing someone of something<br/>that you feel they deserve.  Do not judge me for not accusing.  Bear with<br/>me.</p><p>These are my beliefs, and other thoughts.</p><p>This first item is clearly a belief I have held for some time.  It has not<br/>been developed for the current situation.  By bringing this up here I am<br/>talking mainly not to Peter, but to everyone else, particularly to anyone<br/>who might think Peter might be antisemitic.</p><p>Even if someone *were* antisemitic, it might be a worthy thing to have a<br/>discussion with them rather than attacking them or otherwise dismissing<br/>them.  This I am saying mainly to everyone else but Peter, but Peter must<br/>inevitably read it also, so please Peter I am making no accusations.  I am<br/>trying to help other people to not polarize against you because of what they<br/>might think that you might be, or even because of what they are sure you<br/>are, whether they have spoken it or not.</p><p>If someone *might* be antisemitic based on some association, why are you in<br/>such a hurry to find out more about the person?  Here is one example of a<br/>reason why I think you might do that.  You want to find out so that you can<br/>pinpoint the person into some label that will allow you to know if you<br/>should consider yourself unsafe.  (Recognizing danger is perhaps an<br/>&quot;instinct&quot;.)  You do not want to have a dialog with such a person and you<br/>want to know whether the person in question is such a person.  Instead here<br/>is an alternative:  trust your own ability in dialog.  Things will come<br/>through, even in discussions of tuning, in which all the essential human<br/>elements will be exposed in the dialog, and at the effect of the dialog.  If<br/>the dialog does not polarize then mutual understanding may be possible in<br/>which *both* sides are broadened - yes, even if one side was conceived of as<br/>&quot;bad&quot;.  My belief is that if we knew not only each others inner minds (which<br/>alone might scare us away) but also our inner hearts, our pain, our injury,<br/>we would all understand each other, and we would let go of the fears which<br/>usually drive us to create our polarities, our categories.</p><p>Categories like antisemitism have a lot of flavors.  Antisemitism is<br/>particularly involved in a lot of polarity right now and I want to drop it<br/>and instead just talk about &quot;racism&quot;, and what it is to be racist.</p><p>There are many kinds of racism.  For example:</p><p>* racism in which the person is proud to be racist, proud to use the<br/>particular term associated with their form of racism</p><p>* racism which a person denies but nonetheless still manifests in their<br/>actions, in spite of a conscious belief that they are not racist and<br/>apparently even a genuine desire not to be racist</p><p>* racism which a person is aware of and does not want, but finds themselves<br/>involved in, mainly perhaps in the form of fear - not being able to avoid<br/>fearing people of a certain race, because of unfamiliarity of either a<br/>bodily or a cultural nature which triggers fear.  Many people declare<br/>themselves to be this kind of racist, and wish to heal from it.  This may<br/>include besides fear, unavoiable inability to relate to people of a certain<br/>race.</p><p>* subtle flavors of opinions which relate to racism, associated with racism<br/>because of certain common features</p><p>* individual variations whose subtleties defy description</p><p>* things related to racism which are not racism at all, but which enter<br/>dangerous or controversial territory</p><p>I hope the above is somewhat self-evident.  I&apos;m not trying to declare myself<br/>an expert on anything.  I have no credentials.  I have only my own<br/>experience.</p><p>So how can you know so much about a racist or even whether a person is a<br/>racist?  You can know what they call themselves.  You can know other things<br/>that they wish to tell you.  Are you so sure of all the rest that you lose<br/>all your trust in your ability to be with them, to understand them, to ever<br/>have a dialog with them?</p><p>It may well be that these topics are worthy of discussion, discussion which<br/>can be entered and maintained without perpetuating polarization.  It may be<br/>that they are off-topic for the tunings list.  It may be that some of them<br/>are not off topic, at least not for now.  But perhaps some agreement can be<br/>reached regarding which topics should be discussed where.</p><p>I think all of us can do better.  If we do not compare our weaknesses to see<br/>which weakness is much worse than which other weakness, we will all realize<br/>that we all have a lot to learn.  I include *everyone* in this.  I include<br/>myself.</p><p>Some things we have to learn will be pointed out by other people.  If we can<br/>point things like this out with the minimum injury, it will greatly aid in<br/>communication and understanding.  Please everyone for the moment assume you<br/>have a lesson to learn from this.  Even assume you have a lesson that you<br/>have missed.  Even assume that by missing it you might have caused<br/>unnecessary pain.  And then forgive yourself for that.  If you see someone<br/>as behaving badly try to imagine and understand why a person might be driven<br/>to behave that way, so that you can forgive them.  Certain things perhaps<br/>can not be forgiven by a health society.  But please be very clear: that<br/>that awful line has probably not been crossed by anyone on this list.  And<br/>even if it were:  can you be so sure you have no such possibility within<br/>yourself, that it could not have been you?</p><p>Please move on with me to a more healing ground.</p><p>Here is a particular suggestion.  For posts concerning these issues,<br/>consider not replying to a previous post.  Instead start your own post.  Say<br/>where you are.  Do not accuse anyone of anything.  Do this in spite of what<br/>you believe is deserved, so that you can have the experience of what is<br/>possible when you do that.  It is *very* hard to do this via email.  If you<br/>fail here please take some of this with you elsewhere in life and try it,<br/>and look for support to get you through the difficulty of it.</p><p>Please also try to forgive past grievances.  Please ask yourself, regardless<br/>of your previous judgement - is it possible that in some way I brought this<br/>on?  Sometimes it is very hard to know.  Some of us have been deeply injured<br/>in one way or another - perhaps most of us.  In some it shows in different<br/>ways.  If you press the right button you may hit a deep injury.  Must the<br/>person then be judged for their reaction?  Ultimately we are accountable.<br/>But accountability and responsibility are of no consequence if there is not<br/>an opportunity to learn from a mistake.  Learning is much harder in an<br/>atmosphere of acusation than one of acceptance.</p><p>Please do not think harshly of me for my inclusiveness, for my lack of<br/>acusation.  Do not judge me as nieve.  I may know more than you imagine<br/>about what is possible.  Please be inspired by that possibility, or rather<br/>not by my experience but by what you might experience, if you allow it.  I<br/>have been through some things which have led me to my own inpiration.<br/>Perhaps only by enduring much pain can one be inspired to more courage.  I<br/>am not suggesting to seek pain, but rather to not avoid feeling it when it<br/>is there.  There is much pain to be felt.  To do this fully requires more<br/>courage than we can endure, so we must find all the courage we have so we<br/>can endure as much as possible.  This is the real world, right here.  This<br/>is the whole world, right here.  All of our experiences are of value.</p><p>Much love,<br/>Kurt</p></div><h3>Aaron K.

As someone who uses a<br/>slendro scale taken out to 12 places i can assure you that even playing all 12 tones at once<br/>cannot produce the disonance of many of the chords produced in a strait 5 limit tuning. What you<br/>gain in Cononance you also gain with increase disonance.<br/>     As for the Australian Aboriginal, the purpose and intention of this music is quite different<br/>that the say the garbled Heroic Ego alternating with the whimpering nostalgiac sadness of a<br/>Schumann. Their &quot;technology&quot; is far superior to accomplish their goals than any lesson or<br/>technology of counterpoint can approach.</p><p>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; On Tuesday 09 December 2003 03:12 pm, Peter Wakefield Sault wrote:<br/>&gt;  Undeveloped human consciousness is like a<br/>&gt; &gt; dreamstate - best typified by that of the Australian Aboriginal prior<br/>&gt; &gt; to the arrival of Europeans.</p><p>-- -Kraig Grady<br/>North American Embassy of Anaphoria Island<br/> <a href="http://www.anaphoria.com">http://www.anaphoria.com</a><br/>The Wandering Medicine Show<br/> KXLU 88.9 FM WED 8-9PM PST</p></div><h3>rumsong &#x3C;rumsong@telus.net&#x3E;</h3><span>12/10/2003 11:33:43 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;Aaron K.

Until then it was used to<br/>describe many unrestrictive circulating temperaments which are here<br/>called &apos;well temperaments&apos;.

Your comments are well-taken. I think you will find<br/>&gt; that my attitude is usually reactive.  Some people in this group<br/>&gt; express themselves with such superciliousness as puts me straight<br/>&gt; into attack mode.</p><p>I feel honored that you are willing to stand together with me on such a<br/>neutral ground.  This being honored is not meant to be an offering to your<br/>&quot;ego&quot; but an acknowledgement of the depth of what we are touching on, and<br/>the value of this common ground in the midst of a very polarized atmosphere.</p><p>I find that your attitude *has been* very reactive quite often.  I wish you<br/>would join me in the past tense description.  I also find that you have an<br/>incredible capacity for an almost *formal* graciousness at times.  I want to<br/>underline this gift (which is not your only gift) and ask you to look at<br/>things a little differently so that you find more opportunities to make use<br/>of this gift.</p><p>When you get triggered by someone I do not suggest that you are limited to<br/>simply putting a cap on it.  It is possible for you to acknowledge how it<br/>fired you up without actually firing it back at the other person.  But first<br/>of all realize that the slate is not clear.  If you experience<br/>superciliousness realize that it may be from a person who believes they have<br/>experienced such from you.  It is sometimes hard to trace things back to<br/>their original cause.  Sometimes the original cause was unnoticed by the<br/>person in whose expression it was embedded.</p><p>Being gracious even where graciousness may possibly not be deserved is one<br/>way to give benefit of the doubt, acknowledging the possibility that it is<br/>actually unknown &quot;who started it&quot; so to speak.</p><p>My memory, which is by no means perfect, is that what fired you up<br/>*originally* in many cases was not superciliousness but something else,<br/>something which you have little tolerance for, but which is based on values<br/>which are rather unique to you, if not in fact ideosyncratic, but which in<br/>any case represents a kind of judgement which is certainly *very* unfamiliar<br/>in the culture of this group which please trust me has been for the most<br/>very congenial for quite some time.  Please believe this and take seriously<br/>the implications of it, and then please comment on what this might mean to<br/>you, if possible without passing judgement on anyone in this group.  The<br/>discomfort around you was well under way before the whole &quot;antisemitic&quot;<br/>thing came up, an event which only served to compound the confusion of the<br/>process of communication here, regardless of its apparent importance to some<br/>people.  The fact of that event works against the entire process that I am<br/>hoping for, and I hope you can find ways to make additional allowances for<br/>it, realizing the confusion it has injected and how this has damaged<br/>communication from all sides.  Whatever forgiving you can do in relation to<br/>that event will therefore probably also help you to be less reactive, so we<br/>can get down to the business of finding better ways to communicate, which is<br/>by far the more central issue, as I see it.  I am suggesting that you can<br/>not hold on to an importance about that event without compromising the<br/>unfolding of communication here, which was an issue prior to that event.  If<br/>the communication in general were to clear up fully then the &quot;event&quot; would<br/>shrink in importance, because even if not acted on immediately or on this<br/>particular list, the implications of the *experience* of a good base of<br/>communication would transform the event itself by disarming the very root of<br/>the &quot;antisemitic&quot; polarization, because deeply we all understand that these<br/>things depend on failed communication in order to flourish.  That is my<br/>belief in any case.  If that is not clear enough to anyone please say so and<br/>I will attempt to clarify it.</p><p>So you may have revealed a possible opening into a more pleasant ground for<br/>all of us.  Here is my suggestion.  If you are willing to set the slate<br/>clear to give this benefit of doubt, and then *as soon* as you are triggered<br/>by anything, before allowing the &quot;attack mode&quot; to go through, simply<br/>acknowledge in your writing as clearly as possible (and more clearly than<br/>you have) what it is that inflamed you.  A phrase such as &quot;I felt blah blah&quot;<br/>is probably much more helpful in this context than &quot;You did blah blah&quot;.</p><p>I would go so far as to suggest that you might use a style like this:  &quot;That<br/>really ticked me off, but I do not need to take it personally.  Here is what<br/>happenned in me as I read what you just wrote... blah blah blah.&quot;  Such a<br/>form is very likely not to elicit any further reaction from the other party,<br/>in my experience.  There are many possible variations of style of course.<br/>However, I think this is a situation in which agreeing on some possible<br/>&quot;forms&quot; for communication might help things to ease up quite a bit.</p><p>Thanks for your consideration.</p><p>-Kurt</p></div><h3>Peter Wakefield Sault &#x3C;sault@cyberware.co.uk&#x3E;</h3><span>12/10/2003 8:53:47 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;rumsong&quot; &lt;rumsong@t...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; An unwillingness to debate the matter indicates a closed<br/>&gt; mind.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; This is not always true.

I seriously doubt any<br/>self-respecting keyboardist would do anything other than<br/>the usual procedure of setting the temperament and then<br/>tuning outward by octaves.</p><p>&gt;At least, nineteenth century tunings are more equally<br/>&gt;tuned than those of Bach&apos;s time, and in the C20<br/>&gt;that is when the tuning became most even that is<br/>&gt;possible with 12-eq, so if you take it one century<br/>&gt;at a time...If you draw that graph and plot a likely<br/>&gt;tuning for Bach then I&apos;m sure it would be far from<br/>&gt;equal.

Modern performances of Bach in<br/>Werckmeister III tuning improve the music when it is compared to equal temperament.<br/>Try comparing Bach&apos;s &quot;Chromatic Fantasy&quot; in D minor as played by Igor Kipnis in<br/>Werckmeister III and then someone else in ET and the difference is<br/>remarkable.</p><p>&gt;<br/>&gt; My best evidence that Bach tuned his claviers to equal temper as we<br/>&gt; know it is indeed the existence of equal tempered guitars since the<br/>&gt; 16th century.</p><p>While the pedigree of ET goes way back in history, it is more likely that<br/>different tunings were used in different musical contexts.  ET guitar would have<br/>little to no bearing on Bach.</p><p>As I previously stated, such guitars can be viewed at<br/>&gt; the Victoria &amp;Albert Museum in London. Many of Bach&apos;s melodic<br/>&gt; figures actually derive from guitar fingerings, indicating that he<br/>&gt; was not only aware of, but played, the guitar. I believe that Bach<br/>&gt; truly did innovate true equal temper by tuning his claviers to such<br/>&gt; guitars in order that he could reproduce the melodic figures which<br/>&gt; had evolved on those instruments.</p><p>Interesting theory.  However, the organ made a much greater impression on JS<br/>Bach and the use of ET on an organ is most noticeable when compared to either<br/>a meantone or a well-temperament.  As Werckmesiter hit the stage exactly one<br/>generation before JS Bach, it is most reasonable to look in this direction<br/>rather than the direction of fretted guitars in ET.</p><p> Bear in mind that, as Jorgensen<br/>&gt; points out, what everybody here calls &apos;meantone&apos; is what was simply<br/>&gt; called &apos;keyboard tuning&apos; in past eras (not to say past ears).</p><p>England (and The Netherlands) did not parlay in the well-temperaments as much<br/>as Germany, or even France.  Keyboard tuning was quite variegated (a Johann<br/>Philipp Kirnberger designation, a Bach disciple).</p><p>That is &gt; why he was rejected by so very many of his contemporaries. Bach&apos;s<br/>&gt; music did not emerge from the shadows until the late 19th century,<br/>&gt; mainly as a result of its promotion by Mendelssohn.</p><p>Ah, but Papa Bach was quite important in Europe before 1740.  It&apos;s just that<br/>music began to be created in a more vertical concentration, as melody against<br/>chords.  It might be proper to say that Europe actually waited for Papa Bach<br/>to die in 1750 so that music could officially be allowed to progress onwards.<br/>Rather than rejected, I might prefer neglected, but you are correct that it<br/>was young Mendelssohn that brought the St. Matthew&apos;s Passion to life in Leipzig,<br/>thus resurrecting the Bach spirt of music.</p><p>Jorgensen himself &gt; points out that equal temper as we know it is indeed a<br/>&gt; form of well<br/>&gt; temper.</p><p>This is true indeed.</p><p>Therefore it is still highly likely that Bach really was 200 &gt;<br/>&gt; years ahead of his time in tuning his clavichords and harpsichords to<br/>&gt; true equal temper.<br/>&gt;</p><p>This makes more sense looking backwards from the present than it does seeing<br/>the advances in the tuning of keyboards from the Renaissance until Bach&apos;s<br/>time.</p><p>&gt; Bach&apos;s organ compositions are an entirely different matter.

He was simply part of a long tradition of chromatic<br/>keyboard music, which Telemann also produced a fair share of.<br/>Bach did create some of the most awe-inspiring music of any<br/>composer, and when he did chromaticism there was no exception.</p><p>I don&apos;t know why Telemann is so often derided.  He is in my mind<br/>a composer of incredible importance who wrote some of the best<br/>chamber music ever, who was more prolific than Vivaldi plus the<br/>average quality of the works is much higher.</p><p>&gt;If some at that time played pianos in 12-et you would<br/>&gt;expect a spectrum with some others not willing to go<br/>&gt;quite that far but who used tempers that were<br/>&gt;fairly close to 12-et. At least if the 12-et<br/>&gt;ones discussed their ideas and tried to persuade<br/>&gt;others of the time to understand their position.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;If it was just a single individual who privately<br/>&gt;tuned his piano to 12-et and was regarded as<br/>&gt;highly eccentric at the  time by his few friends who knew<br/>&gt;about it, didn&apos;t say anything about it to<br/>&gt;anyone,and he didn&apos;t mind what others<br/>&gt;thought and just went aheaad anyway then that is<br/>&gt;another matter. Such things can happen<br/>&gt;of course and won&apos;t appear in the history<br/>&gt;books as no-one would talk about it as<br/>&gt;it is just so way out of their experience<br/>&gt;that they ignore it totally.</p><p>Of course.  And keep in mind that people did not then do<br/>as we do, identifying a scale by name, knowing the cents<br/>values, etc.  Even piano tuners today vary from an exact<br/>ET quite often.

In modal<br/>  music there was a long tradition of *highly* chromatic works, esp.<br/>  in the North German toccata style from which Bach descends, and also<br/>  notably in France and Italy.  The early tonal music was very much<br/>  less chromatic, and it took until Chopin until the new style evolved<br/>  its own chromaticism (though check out Mozart&apos;s Minuet No. 6 in D,<br/>  K355 sometime!).

For one thing the level of accuracy expected<br/>&gt; of keyboard instruments (clavichord excepted) is far greater<br/>&gt; than that of fretted strings (which to some extent have<br/>&gt; variable intonation depending on how notes are executed).</p><p>Rightio I see. Though as far as tuning of strings with<br/>each other I wonder if guitarists ever try using fine tune<br/>adjustments at the bridge end. Lets you tune far more<br/>finely at least on &apos;cello. I remember when I once went<br/>to a concert of Bach &apos;cello suites played by Rostropovitch, he had<br/>fine tuning adjustments on every string of his &apos;cello,<br/>not just the A string where it is normal to have them.</p><p>Though - the way the strings are tuned with each other<br/>wouldn&apos;t matter, as one can tune from just a single<br/>string. Indeed use a monochord as Manuel suggested,<br/>one which you make especially for the purpose, maybe<br/>a large one with carefully positioned frets.<br/>You only need twelve of them to map out a single<br/>octave.</p><p>And in those days they didn&apos;t need to be concerned about<br/>the high tensions of the strings so I suppose octave<br/>stretching is less of a problem.</p><p>&gt; For another the decay of a lute is quite fast compared<br/>even to a harpsichord. And with pianos other differences<br/>&gt; of timbre will come into play.</p><p>Well there I wonder, you wouldn&apos;t need to use beats to tune to it<br/>perhaps.</p><p>I&apos;m just talking in theory as I haven&apos;t had<br/>to tune a stringed instrument for ages, then<br/>only the A of my &apos;cello to a tuning fork.</p><p>But I have tried this kind of thing tuning a<br/>note in software to a recording of an audio file<br/>as a way to transcribe its pitch.</p><p>Just play a comparison note on the monochord, remember it,<br/>and then adjust the tuning to the note heard.</p><p>That may only get it to within maybe 4 or 5 cents +-<br/>if one has good (but not extraordinary) pitch acuity<br/>but you can do a bit better than that. Tune up as far as you can<br/>go before you hear a difference of pitch between<br/>the note on the monochord and the one on your instrument.<br/>Then tune down, in the same fashion, then find<br/>the mid-point of those two positions to your<br/>best approximation. Best if the tuning<br/>key turns quite a way between the two positions<br/>I suppose, fine tuning adjustment.</p><p>I haven&apos;t measured to see how accurately I can<br/>tune that way but it probably can be done<br/>fairly accurately. Maybe I&apos;ll experiment and<br/>see.</p><p>Someone like Johnny Newton perhaps could<br/>use such a method to get within<br/>a tiny fraction of a cent that way I wonder...</p><p>BTW another thought about ET - to modern ears<br/>then the tunings aren&apos;t so very easily<br/>distinguishable from 12-eq for a newbie.</p><p>But in those days they wouldn&apos;t be used to hearing<br/>12-eq all the time as we are. Only on lutes and<br/>guitars. Who can know what effect there is of<br/>ones entire culture using well tempered keyboards.<br/>Perhaps musiians develop greater sensitivity<br/>to pitch insuch a situation, to the qualities<br/>of instruments in various temperaments.</p><p>Perhaps if they then heard a keybord in 12-eq then it might<br/>be quite noticeable after an entire lifetime of<br/>never ever hearing a keyboard played in that<br/>tuning.</p><p>Robert</p></div><h3>Peter Wakefield Sault &#x3C;sault@cyberware.co.uk&#x3E;</h3><span>12/11/2003 11:10:54 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>&gt; If I were to take you up on an offer of absolute power I would<br/>undermine a<br/>&gt; bit of what I am hoping for, right?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; However, I will go ahead and offer feedback as it comes naturally<br/>to me.<br/>&gt; But I&apos;d rather not even depend on the expectation that you would<br/>accept<br/>&gt; anything I suggest, because my inclinations would become<br/>immediately a<br/>&gt; little &quot;corrupt&quot;.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; We&apos;ll see how it goes.

Interestingly, many of the orchestral instruments of<br/>the baroque period (esp. brass) were not scored outside of a<br/>particular key!  Chromaticism was therefore very limited.  Also<br/>because of its abstract/esoteric nature the keyboard tends to invite<br/>more chromaticism.  Even into the romantic period this persisted,<br/>though brass players were expected to have more than one horn<br/>available, and of course valved instruments were coming about.  Even<br/>today many brass instruments come in &quot;double&quot; versions, with a special<br/>&quot;key&quot; that switches them to another key -- it was originally like<br/>carrying two horns in one.  Even today, valveless trombones, for<br/>example, play much better than valved ones, and some performers do go<br/>to the trouble of carrying horns in different keys.  A gigging trumpet<br/>player must have C, Eb/Db, Piccolo, and Flugelhorn trempets in his<br/>keep.

For one thing the level of accuracy expected<br/>&gt; &gt; of keyboard instruments (clavichord excepted) is far greater<br/>&gt; &gt; than that of fretted strings (which to some extent have<br/>&gt; &gt; variable intonation depending on how notes are executed).<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Rightio I see. Though as far as tuning of strings with<br/>&gt; each other I wonder if guitarists ever try using fine tune<br/>&gt; adjustments at the bridge end. Lets you tune far more<br/>&gt; finely at least on &apos;cello. I remember when I once went<br/>&gt; to a concert of Bach &apos;cello suites played by Rostropovitch, he had<br/>&gt; fine tuning adjustments on every string of his &apos;cello,<br/>&gt; not just the A string where it is normal to have them.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Though - the way the strings are tuned with each other<br/>&gt; wouldn&apos;t matter, as one can tune from just a single<br/>&gt; string. Indeed use a monochord as Manuel suggested,<br/>&gt; one which you make especially for the purpose, maybe<br/>&gt; a large one with carefully positioned frets.<br/>&gt; You only need twelve of them to map out a single<br/>&gt; octave.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; And in those days they didn&apos;t need to be concerned about<br/>&gt; the high tensions of the strings so I suppose octave<br/>&gt; stretching is less of a problem.<br/>&gt;</p><p>I am acutely aware of the difficulties of tuning older instruments.<br/>Rigid steel-framed harps in claviers are a modern development. I once<br/>owned an antique timber-framed Broadwood piano and had to retune it<br/>every day. Such fine tunings as the modern musician expects as a<br/>matter of course are simply not possible on a timber-framed<br/>instrument since the slightest change to the tension of one string<br/>affects every other string on the harp. One must be satisfied with<br/>simply minimizing out-of-tuneness - or risk driving oneself mad.</p><p>However, the sound was beautiful.</p></div><h3>Kurt Bigler &#x3C;kkb@breathsense.com&#x3E;</h3><span>12/12/2003 11:37:22 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>on 12/12/03 5:43 PM, Peter Wakefield Sault &lt;<a href="mailto:sault@cyberware.co.uk">sault@cyberware.co.uk</a>&gt; wrote:</p><p>&gt; --- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;alternativetuning&quot;<br/>&gt; &lt;alternativetuning@y...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;&gt; You seem to have several misconceptions.
