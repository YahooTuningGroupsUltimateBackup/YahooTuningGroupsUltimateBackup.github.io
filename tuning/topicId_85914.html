After the first rough silent midnight listening from<br/>the miniature mono computer speaker, with noisy accompaniment of more<br/>HD and ventilators, I would think it&apos;s one of your new recordings<br/>(let&apos;s don&apos;t call it composition) and you did it mainly with your<br/>voice. I don&apos;t doubt about your ability to do everything in the tune<br/>you wanted, I just wonder how many tracks you have used here for allthose playbacks. Or maybe you used some harmonizer (or pitch shifter)<br/>plugin for those chords? And why Italian title, I&apos;ve heard rather<br/>some Swahili or Xhosa (or was it Navi)?</p><p>Daniel Forro</p><p>On 29 Jan 2010, at 9:45 PM, Petr Pa&rcaron;&iacute;zek wrote:</p><p>&gt;<br/>&gt; Hi tuners,<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; before I tell you what it is and where it comes from, I&apos;ll let you<br/>&gt; hear it<br/>&gt; first.

Csound was not used. I made a few &quot;shots&quot; with my good old analog four-track recorder, then I transferred them into my PC and made lots of weird things with them using sound editors like CoolEdit or Sound Forge. I&apos;m planning to make a higher-quality recording of this piece one day. I used a maximum of 7 layers of my voice to make the clusters and chords (that&apos;s the reason why there&apos;s so much noise there; the pre-amp itself is pretty noisy and mixing 7 layers of that makes it even noisier). There weren&apos;t pitch shifters or harmonizers used but conventional speeding up or slowing down was used. Apart from that, there were also some narrow bandpass filters in a few places, chained flanger and non-linear distortion.</p><p>#2. The reason for the Italian title was just the simple fact that &quot;Non c&apos;era nessuno&quot; sounds nicer to me than the Czech &quot;Nebyl tam nikdo&quot;. The words aren&apos;t in any particular language, I simply took a couple of persons&apos; names used in some foreign languages, altered their pronunciation a bit to the way I liked, and made a few anagrams with them. The main reason why I decided to record this piece was some sort of protest against those devices and plugins for automatic intonation correction which have been used so often in popular music for the last 10 years or so (which makes it sometimes impossible to distinguish a singer who has been developping his/her intonation for years from someone who sings out of tune without electronic &quot;post-processing&quot;). The only consolation for people like us may be that those &quot;tools&quot;, at least for the time being, are able to round off the pitches only to 12-equal.</p><p>Petr</p><p>PS: It would be interesting to hear what the stripped part of the Avatar soundtrack sounded like. :-)</p></div><h3>Chris Vaisvil &#x3C;chrisvaisvil@...&#x3E;</h3><span>1/29/2010 8:41:01 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Petr,</p><p>A really impressive tour de force with conventional digital processing.

In that application you can<br/>manipulate any monophonic line to +/- 1 cent - manually. While I&apos;d hate to<br/>tune a 5 minute 6 instrument piece it is possible to do microtonal tunings<br/>via this application. The caveat is the further away for the original source<br/>the more unrealistic it gets - at least with sounds that have a format<br/>filter - like voice or guitar.</p><p>On Fri, Jan 29, 2010 at 12:16 PM, Daniel Forr&oacute; &lt;dan.for@...&gt; wrote:</p><p>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; But some artists and producers used autotune effect quite creatively,<br/>&gt; with exaggerated setting which had pretty strange artificially<br/>&gt; sounding voice in the result.
