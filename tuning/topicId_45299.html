It is a fascinating story.</p><p>It was published after Handel&apos;s death (1759) and anticipates Jean-Jacques<br/>Rousseau&apos;s well-temperament (1768), both of which are not in Barbour.  It was<br/>published in 1780 in London by Longman and Broderip, No. 26 Cheapside, Music<br/>Sellers to the Royal Family, along with 12 Voluntaries and Fugues for the Organ or<br/>Harpsichord. While there is some question as to whether it is authentically<br/>Handelian, Jorgensen has immense respect for it and states it is the best<br/>tuning of its time.  &quot;The ease of tuning is not the only indication that the Handel<br/>temperament was composed by a master&quot; (Jorgensen, p. 159).</p><p>There are six different sizes of fifths, the same number required by<br/>Rousseau.  &quot;There was no purpose in having varying sizes of fifths other than to have<br/>varying modulatory effects or key-color changes as in well temperament&quot;<br/>(Jorgensen, p. 159).</p><p>Most interesting, as it refers to past list discussions, is that this tuning<br/>is tuned melodically: that is, one note followed the other as when singing.<br/>&quot;Whenever equal-beating techniques or equal-beating increments cannot be<br/>applied to a temperament system without distorting the intended theory, this can be<br/>taken as proof that the author was tempering melodically&quot; (Jorgensen, p. 160).</p><p>&quot;If Handel was not the author of these temperament rules, then it must have<br/>been someone else who had an extraordinarily developed musical ear that was<br/>capable of melodically hearing intervals altered in increments of a twenty-fifth<br/>part of the diatonic comma [0.9 cent).  Only the musicians of the 1780s that<br/>were blessed with Handel&apos;s high degree of talent could have followed these<br/>rules and produced the proper results&quot; (Jorgensen, p. 160).  And all along I have<br/>said that one can, and does, tune melodically by 1 cent.</p><p>After some calculations, I constructed its chromatic scale:</p><p>C    0<br/>C#     93<br/>D     194<br/>Eb    296<br/>E      396<br/>F      499<br/>F#     591<br/>G      697<br/>G#    795<br/>A      896<br/>Bb    997<br/>B    1094</p><p>best, Johnny Reinhard</p></div>
