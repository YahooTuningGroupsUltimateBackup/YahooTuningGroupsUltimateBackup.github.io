I&apos;m not sure if<br/>its the classical guitar timbre hiding the dissonance, or the ultimate<br/>fecundity of the harmonic series in its many forms. I&apos;m &quot;partial&quot; towards<br/>the latter explanation.</p><p>Two features I notice with this guitar are: the way that (some) higher prime<br/>partials approximate lower prime ratios (others instead produce unique<br/>intervals that do not sound at all like &quot;mistuned&quot; lower ratios), and the<br/>selection of available pitches based on the appearance of primes in the<br/>series. Both of these contribute to the overall sound of the instrument.</p><p>Dante</p><p>-----Original Message-----<br/>From: <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a> [<a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>]On Behalf Of<br/>Carl Lumma<br/>Sent: Monday, November 13, 2006 11:44 PM<br/>To: <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a><br/>Subject: [tuning] Re: New guitar: Prime Guitar w/mp3</p><p>Simply wonderful.</p><p>It seems like it shouldn&apos;t sound as good as it does given<br/>the tuning.
