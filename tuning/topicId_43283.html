This fact is<br/>&gt; corroborated by the history of the pitch of organs; by the history<br/>&gt; of music, which shows that organs were used in combination with<br/>&gt; other instrument, making it obligatory for the organist to<br/>&gt; transpose every now and then; and by the fact that the meantone<br/>&gt; temperament was the standard temperament to the Northern German<br/>&gt; organ building tradition to which Schnitger belonged.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;</p><p>Is this Schnitger related to Arp Schnitger who was Andreas Werckmeister&apos;s<br/>friend?</p><p>best, Johnny Reinhard</p></div>
