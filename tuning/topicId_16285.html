I get people<br/>constantly asking me about the subject; they&apos;ve heard about something<br/>unusual I&apos;m into, and are curious. And, overall, the response is very<br/>favorable. I, too, look to the day when 12 eq is not the king of the<br/>tunings...and, if this does happen, I&apos;m sure it will largely come about<br/>because of all the hard work the folks on this list have put into making<br/>it happen...Hstick</p></div><h3><a id=16310 href="#16310">ðŸ”—</a>Joseph Pehrson &#x3C;josephpehrson@compuserve.com&#x3E;</h3><span>12/6/2000 8:26:59 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@egroups.com">tuning@egroups.com</a>, Neil Haverstick &lt;STICK@U...&gt; wrote:</p><p><a href="http://www.egroups.com/message/tuning/16285">http://www.egroups.com/message/tuning/16285</a></p><p>OK... here is something to add to the mix.

I don&apos;t have the URL handy now, but you should be<br/>able to find it in a search.  The latest version I know of<br/>is called &apos;WIDI 2.6&apos;.

The program was *that* good at<br/>emulating the vowel formants with pitch as well as the<br/>consonants with the attack envelopes.</p><p>I emailed the MIDI-file to Paul Erlich at the time and he was<br/>as amazed as I was.  I also emailed the programmer who wrote<br/>the software and suggested that he make use of pitch-bend<br/>for even better accuracy with the vowel formants.  The version<br/>then current did not make any use of pitch-bend.  He wrote<br/>me a favorable response, but as far as I know, has not yet<br/>implemented pitch-bend in WIDI.</p><p>Check it out - I guarantee you&apos;ll be impressed!</p><p>-monz<br/><a href="http://www.ixpres.com/interval/monzo/homepage.html">http://www.ixpres.com/interval/monzo/homepage.html</a><br/>&apos;All roads lead to n^0&apos;</p></div><h3><a id=16325 href="#16325">ðŸ”—</a>Seth Austen &#x3C;acoustic@landmarknet.net&#x3E;</h3><span>12/7/2000 7:02:49 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>on 12/6/00 12:02 AM, <a href="mailto:tuning@egroups.com">tuning@egroups.com</a> at <a href="mailto:tuning@egroups.com">tuning@egroups.com</a> wrote:</p><p>&gt; Message: 25<br/>&gt; Date: Tue, 05 Dec 2000 22:05:29 -0700<br/>&gt; From: Neil Haverstick &lt;<a href="mailto:STICK@USWEST.NET">STICK@USWEST.NET</a>&gt;<br/>&gt; Subject: exposing folks to microtones<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Jacky...I have made my microtonal pursuits an everyday part of my<br/>&gt; interaction with others, especially students, of which I have many.

Also 1/1, 6/5, 3/2, - 0<br/>300 700. This simple demo is so much fun because folks hear those<br/>nasty 12 tET 3rds in their true light (and on the familiar &quot;piano&quot;<br/>timbre, this is especially effective)! Usually recognizing it for the<br/>first time. A great way to lay the groundwork for other more exotic<br/>possibilities.</p><p>Thanks for sharing this with the list!</p><p>Jacky Ligon</p></div><h3><a id=16328 href="#16328">ðŸ”—</a>ligonj@northstate.net</h3><span>12/7/2000 8:01:58 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Monz,</p><p>This is extremely interesting!
