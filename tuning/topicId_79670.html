One<br/>&gt; interesting way to get this effect is to get a 5/4 ratio going on a<br/>&gt; synthesizer, and gradually widen it until it gets to 9/7. Doing this by ear<br/>&gt; (i.e. stopping exactly on 9/7) is hard - as you widen 5/4, you start to hear<br/>&gt; some beating, and eventually it quickens until you get to 9/7. At this<br/>&gt; point, if you listen hard enough you suddenly have this perspective shift<br/>&gt; whereby you hear the beating is in some kind of regular pattern, and you<br/>&gt; start to get a sense of the phantom fundamental (which is different than<br/>&gt; that of 5/4 as it isn&apos;t an octave equivalent of the lower note), and it&apos;s<br/>&gt; like &quot;whoa, so this is 9/7&quot;. In my experience, it&apos;s just a matter of finding<br/>&gt; the order in that pattern of beating, which when you do, starts to sound<br/>&gt; more like what I think they&apos;ve been calling &quot;periodicity buzz&quot; around here.</p><p>I think you&apos;ve answered the original question, anyway, which is that<br/>most of us don&apos;t worry about what we&apos;re singing.  We get a computer to<br/>do it for us ;-)</p><p>Singing against a drone is worth a try, anyway.  I practiced a bit of<br/>it.  Even singing a unison can be very difficult.  One thing is that I<br/>got locked into intervals a fair distance away (microtonally speaking)<br/>and was quite happy until I meaured the pitch (with a computer again).<br/> Hearing your own voice start to resonate is a lot different to<br/>playing with some knobs and a computer.</p><p>A shruti box is, well, a box, that makes a drone.  They&apos;re used for<br/>Indian music.  Instead of somebody sitting at the back to make the<br/>drone they switch a shruti box on.  And they&apos;re obviously good to<br/>practice with.</p><p>Good drones are rich in upper partials.  Analog-style filtered<br/>sawtooths work well.  And check your spectrum ... I started with a<br/>&quot;reed organ&quot; preset and couldn&apos;t find the 5:4 resonance.  Then I<br/>checked it and the 5th partial was missing.</p><p>                                Graham</p></div><h3><a id=79675 href="#79675">ðŸ”—</a>caleb morgan &#x3C;calebmrgn@...&#x3E;</h3><span>12/29/2008 3:37:58 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>I&apos;m going to emerge from my Fundamentalist closet.

I brought up this point in a discussion with Carl a few months<br/>ago that never quite ended... The difference from a note to its<br/>&quot;ideal&quot; position in a harmonic series carries information that can<br/>used to aural and artistic effect. I think this is why a lot of people<br/>sometimes prefer the sound of slightly flattened fifths, or why most<br/>12-tet based folks prefer the sound of slightly sharp major thirds<br/>(and prefer 1000 cent minor sevenths to a pure 7/4).

You&apos;ll hear it start to stick out right<br/>away as being that harmonic interval... Now tune your keyboard to just<br/>and do the same thing. You&apos;ll have to play it a lot louder to start to<br/>hear it as breaking away as a harmonic interval rather than a stray<br/>overtone of the fundamental. To be honest, I think that if you didn&apos;t<br/>know that you were playing two notes, and you heard someone else do<br/>this experiment, you&apos;d have to play that top note even louder to hear<br/>it as an interval of two notes - you&apos;d probably hear a &quot;timbral<br/>collapse&quot; to a single note instead.</p></div><h3><a id=79684 href="#79684">ðŸ”—</a>Carl Lumma &#x3C;carl@...&#x3E;</h3><span>12/29/2008 12:52:08 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Hi Caleb,</p><p>There may very well be something to your idea, that the<br/>virtual fundamental (VF) of a complex should be in the<br/>audible range.

The idea I was presenting is that a neutral triad is<br/>going to be heard as a major triad or a minor triad when played in<br/>even a mid register because its virtual fundamental is going to be so<br/>low that it will be below the range of human hearing. My idea was that<br/>perhaps the reason a major third gets muddy at low registers is that<br/>its VF drops below the lowest frequency we can hear , although I could<br/>see how critical band roughness would also contribute to the overall<br/>&quot;muddy&quot; sound of it.</p><p>If that&apos;s true, then the reason that 18:22:27 might just sound like a<br/>flip-floppy major-minor chord, even when played at a mid register, is<br/>that the /27 might be so low that it&apos;s inaudible. Playing it higher up<br/>might pop the VF into hearing range, and then the chord might finally<br/>succeed in having its own stable identity, whether or not it&apos;s a local<br/>maximum of harmonic entropy or any of that.</p><p>The reason I brought this up originally was to demonstrate that<br/>harmonic entropy alone doesn&apos;t determine whether or not you&apos;ll<br/>actually succeed in placing an interval or a triad; it only gives a<br/>rough measure of how difficult the task is in doing it.

Fundamentals are<br/>&gt; everything, to me.<br/>&gt; My ear prefers 5/4 to 9/7, unless the 9/7 is in a high-enough<br/>&gt; register--which is Base-ically, approximately,</p><p>Now here&apos;s a funny thing.  I tried this on my keyboard, and I counted<br/>the steps wrongly.  So when I thought I was hearing a 5/4 it was<br/>really a 9/7.  And it did sound better in the high register!  So, yes,<br/>to my surprise I agree with you completely.</p><p>However, the best triad is still the 4:5:6.</p><p>Caveats apply -- I&apos;m tuned to magic temperament, not JI.  I use a<br/>physical model of a clarinet that happens to be the best instrument I<br/>have in Csound.  I don&apos;t think it&apos;s such a good model that it<br/>suppresses the even partials, but it&apos;s still only one timbre.  And it<br/>breaks down at high pitches.</p><p>&gt; But, I regard my thinking in this connection as sort of Advanced-Beginner,<br/>&gt; not  Connoisseur Level.<br/>&gt; Do others here think register is all-important, and where do you place<br/>&gt; &quot;low-interval limits&quot;, and how do you think of them?<br/>&gt; caleb</p><p>Register is important.  Small intervals in low registers get muddy.<br/>But there&apos;s also less distinction between good and bad intervals in<br/>the bass.  To get theoretically pure chords to sound pure they should<br/>be in the treble.  Widely spread bass notes can reinforce a treble<br/>chord.  Timbre and context are also very important.</p><p>Odd limits are certainly useful.  5-limit chords sound good especially<br/>with a little mistuning.  They&apos;re also very tolerant of bad<br/>inversions.  An inversion of a 5-limit triad that implies complex<br/>ratios is still better than a higher-limit chord implying simpler<br/>ratios.  The higher the limit gets the more important it is to choose<br/>otonalities (simple subsets of the harmonic series) and to get the<br/>inversions right.  As with everything your ears should be the final<br/>arbiter.</p><p>                           Graham</p></div><h3><a id=79699 href="#79699">ðŸ”—</a>Torsten Anders &#x3C;torsten.anders@...&#x3E;</h3><span>12/30/2008 2:17:30 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Dear Graham,</p><p>On Dec 30, 2008, at 2:49 AM, Graham Breed wrote:<br/>&gt; I use a physical model of a clarinet that happens to be the best &gt; instrument I<br/>&gt; have in Csound.

I brought up this point in a discussion with Carl a few months<br/>ago that never quite ended... The difference from a note to its<br/>&quot;ideal&quot; position in a harmonic series carries information that can<br/>used to aural and artistic effect. I think this is why a lot of people<br/>sometimes prefer the sound of slightly flattened fifths, or why most<br/>12-tet based folks prefer the sound of slightly sharp major thirds<br/>(and prefer 1000 cent minor sevenths to a pure 7/4). When the<br/>information given by that note&apos;s difference in the harmonic series is<br/>gone, it sometimes sounds &quot;unsettling&quot; to people not used to it.</p><p>You can notice this effect yourself in 12tet by going to a keyboard<br/>and playing some low note and then playing a major third + a few<br/>octaves as soft as you can. You&apos;ll hear it start to stick out right<br/>away as being that harmonic interval... Now tune your keyboard to just<br/>and do the same thing. You&apos;ll have to play it a lot louder to start to<br/>hear it as breaking away as a harmonic interval rather than a stray<br/>overtone of the fundamental. To be honest, I think that if you didn&apos;t<br/>know that you were playing two notes, and you heard someone else do<br/>this experiment, you&apos;d have to play that top note even louder to hear<br/>it as an interval of two notes - you&apos;d probably hear a &quot;timbral<br/>collapse&quot; to a single note instead.</p></div><h3><a id=79705 href="#79705">ðŸ”—</a>Carl Lumma &#x3C;carl@...&#x3E;</h3><span>12/30/2008 2:29:44 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, chrisvaisvil@... wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I tried this with my korg ms 2000 and did not get the result<br/>&gt; described.</p><p>What exactly is the result described?

Resonance must<br/>involve a system which is passively resonating (i.e. re-sounding) due<br/>to energy received from another active system at one of its natural<br/>frequencies of vibration. What is being discussed here is the<br/>interaction between two active sounding systems, the shruti box (like<br/>a tanpura synthesizer) and the singer.</p><p>In any case, I certainly know this feeling. I regularly sing<br/>harmonically-related intervals (including lower octaves of same)<br/>against the drone of my thickness planer while working in my shop. The<br/>sound is so loud (yes, I wear ear protection) that singing any pure<br/>interval can be felt as a physical sensation. I have also done the<br/>same with a tanpura simulator, and while the effect is much less<br/>compelling, being aware of the sensual aspect of purity, even of the<br/>more distant consonances (not using the word in a traditional sense),<br/>can be learned.</p><p>Acoustically what is happening is the singer is seeking out the points<br/>of minimal impedance in the ambient atmosphere, or &quot;mode locking&quot; with<br/>the drone. It is similar to how organ pipes which independently sound<br/>the frequencies of a slightly impure interval can &quot;draw&quot; or pull<br/>together to sound the pure interval when sounding together - IF they<br/>are close enough together. This happens because of the impedance peaks<br/>and valleys in the air, both inside the windchest and within the organ<br/>case.</p><p>Ciao,</p><p>P</p><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;atower17&quot; &lt;atower17@...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Is anyone out there experiencing the resonance of low prime ratios via<br/>&gt; singing over a drone like a shruti box?
