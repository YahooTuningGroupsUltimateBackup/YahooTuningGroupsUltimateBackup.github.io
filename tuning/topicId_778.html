Octave invariance is never complete no<br/>matter how low the limit, and achieving consonance at higher limits<br/>requires that more and more attention be paid to register. At the<br/>7-limit, it is certainly true that 7:5 is more consonant than 10:7 and<br/>chords that include the former are perceived as more stable than those<br/>that include the latter. Even in 22-tET where these intervals are both<br/>represented by a half-octave, chords where the half-octave represents a<br/>7:5 tend to sound a good deal more stable than those where the<br/>half-octave represents a 10:7. In most contexts, 7:6 is quite a bit more<br/>consonant than 12:7. Even in 12-tET, a minor sixth alone can be heard as<br/>a dissonance, in sharp contrast to a major third. Triadic harmony will<br/>tend to clarify the meaning of the minor sixth to the point where it can<br/>no longer be considered dissonant. At any limit, the choice of bass note<br/>is extremely important in determining the stability of a chord.</p></div><h3><a id=785 href="#785">ðŸ”—</a>bram &#x3C;bram@xxxxx.xxxx&#x3E;</h3><span>2/11/1999 10:02:37 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>On Thu, 11 Feb 1999, Paul H.
