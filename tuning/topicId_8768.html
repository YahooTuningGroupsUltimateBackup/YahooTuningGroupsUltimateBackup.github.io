I&apos;ve never done peyote, but believe it to be a<br/>very serious substance, not to be taken lightly, or for the wrong<br/>reasons. There are folks who consider it sacred. In &quot;A Separate<br/>Reality,&quot; by Carlos Castaneda, there&apos;s a funny comment regarding<br/>peyote...Don Juan and Carlos are hanging with some people who are rather<br/>skeptical about taking it...one of the men says that &quot;it makes you crap<br/>on the roof with your ass on the ground.&quot; Sounds like some microtonal<br/>music I&apos;ve heard...Hstick</p></div>
