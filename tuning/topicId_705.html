See what you think, it&apos;s about 3MB.  I wasn&apos;t at all<br/>impressed listening again from cold, but second time I got into the<br/>swing of it.  Very much work in progress, and may stay that way<br/>forever ;)  It&apos;ll do as a demo, I&apos;ll keep trying for a masterpiece.</p><p>This replaces my elemental suite, in case anybody still wanted that.</p><p>              Graham</p></div><h3><a id=709 href="#709">ðŸ”—</a>nanom3@...</h3><span>7/25/2001 6:43:20 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In crazy_music@y..., &quot;Graham Breed&quot; &lt;graham@m...&gt; wrote:<br/>Hi Graham</p><p>I haven&apos;t had a chance to tell you how much I love your titles.

The<br/>best one I thought of was &quot;Cheese Plant Revivalist Stomp&quot;.  I didn&apos;t<br/>attach it to anything very good, so you can re-use it if you like.</p><p>&gt; I also think the scale has promise, but that may be because I am an<br/>&gt; iterative nut.  Have you posted it somewhere on another list?</p><p>I mentioned it on TBL once, it&apos;s the &quot;optimal&quot; 9-limit temerament<br/>according to my program.  I&apos;ll throw together a longer explanation<br/>sometime, but here are some cents if you want them</p><p>0.0<br/>58.8<br/>117.7<br/>176.5<br/>235.3<br/>262.7<br/>294.1<br/>321.6<br/>380.4<br/>439.2<br/>498.0<br/>556.9<br/>615.7<br/>674.5<br/>702.0<br/>760.8<br/>819.6<br/>878.4<br/>937.3<br/>996.1<br/>1054.9<br/>1082.3<br/>1113.7<br/>1141.2<br/>1200.0</p><p>&gt; My one sugestion for your music would be to get ACID (the program<br/>not<br/>&gt; the hallucinogen :-)  because I think it would really flesh out<br/>your<br/>&gt; guitar playing better than the drum machine.  And use your Kyma<br/>more -<br/>&gt;  I know you could get much weirder.</p><p>There&apos;s already a Kyma module for chopping up drum tracks.  I need to<br/>find some samples and the time to work on them.  In this case, the<br/>drums are done on my Korg, and the next job is to record them live-to-<br/>MIDI.  Everything else is done on Kyma, using a single guitar sample<br/>(which I can upload here if you like, it&apos;s a 783KB AIFF)</p><p>One characteristic of this tuning is how profoundly un-weird it is.<br/>That&apos;s one reason I want the demo finished with so that I can go back<br/>to Miracle (or a mixture of the two).</p><p>&gt; Anyway I think that your work is not nearly as bad as you think it<br/>&gt; is :-)</p><p>As I&apos;ve been playing with music and computers for a few years, and<br/>have this expensive equipment, the results should be excellent by now.</p><p>                   Graham</p></div>
