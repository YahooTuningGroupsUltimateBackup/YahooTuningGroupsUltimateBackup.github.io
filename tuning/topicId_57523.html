Wier &#x3C;dawiertx@sbcglobal.net&#x3E;</h3><span>3/14/2005 11:58:20 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>In the back of a book on the Cairo Congress of 1932 (I can&apos;t remember the author or the title; I just remember it&apos;s in French), I found some photos of microtonal pianos. One of them was Alo&iuml;&iquest;&half;s Haba&apos;s 36-tone instrument which most of you are probably familiar with, but the one that caught my attention was an &quot;Oriental piano&quot; designed by Naguib Nahh&iuml;&iquest;&half;s and built by Rud. Ibach Sohn of Barmen, Germany in 1912.</p><p>It was the first of two keyboard layouts by Nahh&iuml;&iquest;&half;s, and a modification of Halberstadt with a third row of short black keys behind the long black keys. I should draw a GIF of this thing, but I&apos;ll describe it in brief here.</p><p>(I&apos;m not completely sure about the actual tuning, but I can take a guess based on what I know about Arabic scales. I&apos;m also assuming 17-out-of-24-tone equal temperament.)</p><p>The white keys are the same as on a conventional piano, with E and B tuned a quarter-tone flat, so the white keys alone play maq&iuml;&iquest;&half;m ar-r&iuml;&iquest;&half;st. The long black keys are unchanged. The short black keys are:</p><p>Between G-sharp (black) and A (white): A half-flat.<br/>Between B-half flat and C (both white): B natural.<br/>Between C-sharp (black) and D (white): D half-flat.<br/>Between E-half flat and F (both white): E natural.<br/>Between F-sharp (black) and G (white): G half-flat.</p><p>The short black keys placed to the right of long black keys rise higher than the long black keys; the short black keys placed between two white keys are flush with the long black keys. The total range of the piano was four octaves (a qan&iuml;&iquest;&half;n is about three-and-a-half), and the keyboard was slightly concave in design.</p><p>It struck me because it reminded me of a three-row layout I came up with for a 17- or 19-tone keyboard, which adds pedal-like bars in front of the white keys for quarter-tones that are intended to be played primarily with the thumb. I called them &quot;red keys&quot;, though their color should probably match the piano itself. Yamaha has a patent for a 19-tone keyboard with a third row of keys behind the rest of the keys, seven per octave.</p><p>Nahh&iuml;&iquest;&half;s&apos; second layout I presume to be 24-tone equal, with horizontal rows playing whole-tone scales. Dots were placed on every G or C or something. It had a range of six octaves.</p><p>Another &quot;Oriental piano&quot; was designed by Georges Samm&iuml;&iquest;&half;n, and had seven white keys and seven black keys for each octave.</p><p>I might be wrong about the tuning of each note; I&apos;ll double-check everything if and when I get the chance. There isn&apos;t very much about Nahh&iuml;&iquest;&half;s online, at least in English, and I&apos;d like to know more about him.</p><p>On a related note, Roland synthesizers (regular models, not Oriental keyboards) have three built-in temperaments: equal, just and something called &quot;Arabian&quot;, which approximates to the nearest cent the following just scale (1/1 = C):</p><p>1/1, 12/11, 9/8, 32/27, 27/22, 4/3, 16/11, 3/2, 18/11, 27/16, 16/9, 81/44</p><p>The circle of fifths from E-flat to A-natural is Pythagorean. C-sharp, F-sharp and G-sharp are raised a quarter-tone; E-natural and B-natural are lowered a quarter-tone. The scale is not 24-equal, nor is it exactly Zalzal&apos;s tuning, because the quarter-tones are all based on the primes 2, 3 and 11: 12/11 appears instead of 54/49.</p><p>I&apos;ll try to get caught up on replies now.</p></div><h3>Gene Ward Smith &#x3C;gwsmith@svpal.org&#x3E;</h3><span>3/15/2005 12:21:25 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;Daniel A.

But I&apos;m considering writing a method book for microtonal upright and fretless electric bass, which would include a primer on maqamat and other xenharmonic scales from around the world, classical and modern.</p><p>&gt; By the way, I wish to congratulate you for your knowledge of Islamic &gt; sources on music theory. Not everyone wonders about what Middle Eastern &gt; ears wish to hear.</p><p>A lot of this knowledge I&apos;ve only had for a few days, honestly! I&apos;m still learning.</p><p>I learned almost everything on the internet (that&apos;s not always a good thing; lots of disinformation out there). My own desire to incorporate quarter-tones and other microtonals into my own musical style led me to my discovery of the music of the Islamic world. I&apos;ve also wanted to learn the Arabic language, because I had a great uncle who lived in Lebanon and Egypt, and he said it was the most difficult language he ever tried to learn (and he also studied Chinese and Japanese). A lot of it also had to do with my former wife of Arab, Turkish and Iranian ancestry, who I met in 1998.</p><p>I also happen to live in the same town as a Damascus-born singer, who performs concerts twice a year and recently released a CD of traditional Syrian music. She also sells CDs and videos, imports goods from Egypt, Syria and Morocco, teaches bellydance and Arabic, and DJs at a club in downtown Austin once a month.</p><p>And I wonder about what everybody&apos;s ears wants to hear. Listening only to &quot;American music&quot; and nothing else gets boring.</p></div><h3>Ozan Yarman &#x3C;ozanyarman@superonline.com&#x3E;</h3><span>3/17/2005 12:59:52 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Daniel, I&apos;m certain that you are allowed to write a short article using the<br/>pictures and sources you mentioned as reference.

And also to understand global musical tradition, to find out how Western music got its ideas, going back further than Bach and Palestrina, and of course a lot of concepts - musical, scientific and philosophical - we got from the Muslims, who preserved ancient Greek and Persian ideas...</p><p>I can transliterate Arabic and Persian writing and pronounce some of those tough consonants; at least I can do that. Right now, I need to learn the meanings of all those pitch and maqam names - I know what Hijaz, Iraq, Rast, Kurd and the &quot;-kah&quot; notes are though. I also need to better understand the kind of emotions different notes, intervals and modes reflect. (This also pertains to ragas in Indian music, which I&apos;m also studying some.)</p><p>But I do all this as a hobby.
