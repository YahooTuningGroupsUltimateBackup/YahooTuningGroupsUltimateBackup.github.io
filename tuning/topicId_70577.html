How was this made?</p><p>Well, this is how the parts come:<br/>- 1. Playing the headjoint alone. The pitch is changed by partially or entirely covering its open end, sometimes very rapidly.<br/>- 2. Headjoint alone again, but its open end itself is blown instead of the embouchure hole, and the embouchure hole is being alternately covered/uncovered by my finger.<br/>- 3. Headjoint alone again, this time its open end and the embouchure hole alternately are being beaten by my fingers.<br/>- 4. Footjoint mounted right onto the headjoint -- i.e. the middle joint is missing.<br/>- 5. Two lower joints alone -- i.e. headjoint missing. The keys on the two joints are being rapidly depressed and released making the bore to sound in sharp clicks. To get the square-like timbre, I sometimes covered the upper part of the middle joint with my lips.<br/>- 6. Headjoint missing again; the keys are used to change pitches, the upper end of the middle joint is blown like a shakuhachi.<br/>- 7. Once again headjoint missing. The lowest possible pitch is used for most of this section, the upper end of the middle joint is blown like a didjeridu or a brass instrument -- i.e. the lips are almost closed and stay inside it.<br/>- 8. Two upper joints alone -- i.e. footjoint missing this time. The open end of the middle joint is covered by my hand, and the fingering for the lowest possible pitch is alternated with a very similar one in which the last key (meaning the rightmost one) is left released. Because the open end is covered, the resulting effect is the same as on an overtone flute where you can alternate between a series of odd partials when closed and a series of even partials when open.</p><p>If you wish to ask for more details about anything, let me know.</p><p>Petr</p></div>
