In addition to some really heavy music<br/>theory discussions, we had a lot of fun when I visited him.<br/>He&apos;s really up on prog-rock too - I got to hear a lot of<br/>stuff I&apos;ve missed.</p><p>BTW, Jon, did you miss the origin of this whole Zappa thread?<br/>There was no word from you then, and you may know something.</p><p>It all started when I pointed out that a section of &apos;Lumpy Gravy&apos;<br/>sounds like a spliced-in &apos;sample&apos; of a Partch piece.<br/>No one had any concrete (unintended pun, but not bad) info<br/> - anything from you?</p><p>-monz</p><p>Joseph L.
