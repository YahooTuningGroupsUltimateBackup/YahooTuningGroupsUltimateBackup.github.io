I think it would make a lot<br/>of sense.</p><p>Maintaining all those pages is clearly a mammoth tusk<br/>for one person.  You&apos;ve done a fantastic job but many<br/>of the articles are in need of updates, and frequently<br/>you&apos;ve mentioned articles that you would like to update<br/>but don&apos;t have the time to.  Well, a wiki would allow<br/>you to divide that work.</p><p>I notice you smartly put revision history notes at the<br/>bottom of most pages.  But manually tracking this on<br/>each page is another mammoth undertusking.  Wikis track<br/>history automatically.</p><p>Much of the content in the encyclopedia was taken from<br/>this list, and some of us may like to revise comments<br/>we made, which weren&apos;t necessarily originally written<br/>to encyclopedia-quality.  I know you worked with Paul<br/>to update a lot of his stuff, but again, that process<br/>proved cumbersome.  With a wiki, he could do it himself.</p><p>In recent years it&apos;s been wonderful to have some of the<br/>alternative tunings content be accepted on Wikipedia.<br/>But much of it is too niche, or too speculative, to<br/>survive there.  There&apos;s clearly a need for a dedicated<br/>microtonal wiki.  And indeed, there is one:</p><p><a href="http://xenharmonic.wikispaces.com/">http://xenharmonic.wikispaces.com/</a></p><p>And its editors have done a fantastic job (I&apos;ve edited on<br/>only a few occasions).  But wikispaces is a proprietary<br/>service, with advertising.  And it is (or was in the past)<br/>frequently down (not available).</p><p>I would suggest we start a new wiki, merging the content<br/>from your encyclopedia and the wikispaces wiki.  I bet it<br/>would take off like crazy from there.</p><p>Unlike wikipedia, we could control who has what level of<br/>access.  You and the top editors from wikispaces (Jacob<br/>I think) and maybe Graham and I could have admin privileges.<br/>Other microtonalists could have normal privileges, and<br/>the general public would have read-only privileges.</p><p>I am happy to pay for 100% of the cost of such a project<br/>for the first two years, up to US$4,000.  Beyond that, we<br/>could take donations from other microtonalists or consider<br/>opening up to advertising.</p><p>What do you think?</p><p>-Carl</p></div><h3><a id=82493 href="#82493">ðŸ”—</a>Mike Battaglia &#x3C;battaglia01@...&#x3E;</h3><span>3/31/2009 10:54:17 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Check <a href="http://brinkster.com">brinkster.com</a> out - I remember them being pretty cheap.<br/>-Mike</p><p>On Tue, Mar 31, 2009 at 12:47 PM, monz &lt;joemonz@...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt; Hello all,<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Since 2005, when i migrated most of my webpages<br/>&gt; to <a href="http://tonalsoft.com">tonalsoft.com</a> and changed their format from<br/>&gt; .html to .aspx, i have been paying a rather heftly<br/>&gt; monthly fee to the current web host for the website,<br/>&gt; which includes the entire Encyclopedia.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; We expected Tonescape to go commercial sometime<br/>&gt; in 2007, but unfortunately it has been stuck in<br/>&gt; alpha development phase since then.

Just a thought....</p><p>Yes, merging it with the already-existing wiki makes<br/>a whole lot of sense in some ways. But there are some<br/>issues, not least of which is that i no longer have<br/>100% control of the website.</p><p>I formed Tonalsoft with a partner, who invested a<br/>considerable amount of his own money, and even more of<br/>his time and effort, into starting up the company and<br/>actually creating the beautiful wonder that is Tonescape,<br/>even in its unfinished current form.</p><p>So it&apos;s impossible for me to make decisions like this<br/>without his consent, and for now he is unwilling to<br/>make any move that will remove the possibility of<br/>future compensation for his work.</p><p>If we could get the investment money we need to<br/>continue working on Tonescape, things could move<br/>along nicely again. But in today&apos;s economic climate<br/>i&apos;m a bit pessimistic about getting any serious<br/>investment capital.</p><p>&gt; .aspx is evil, especially if it&apos;s no small task to<br/>&gt; script-convert it to html. Another reason to hate Windows.</p><p>Yes, i know. We made a deliberate business decision<br/>to create Tonescape for the Windows platform, and<br/>the software was eventually supposed to be tightly<br/>integrated into our website.</p><p>(This would be another problem with merging the<br/>Encyclopedia with the current wiki. Readers would<br/>have to have some form of Tonescape installed<br/>- and working properly - to view the content we<br/>envision having in the Encyclopedia.)</p><p>I really hate .aspx too. It was much easier for me<br/>to maintain my webpages when they were just the<br/>plain vanilla .html that i used to create them.</p><p>I&apos;m in the process of finally learning python now,<br/>in the hope that i might be able to write python<br/>scripts which can convert the .aspx into whatever<br/>we need on a Linux or BSD host.</p><p>But learning python is going to be a very slow process<br/>for me, in part because now i have a child who is my<br/>number one priority.</p><p>The biggest disappointment for me has been the lack<br/>of interest in Tonescape from the people in this<br/>community, since we did make the alpha release<br/>publicly available at no cost.</p><p>I realize that there have been issues with getting<br/>it installed or working correctly, and mostly that is<br/>the fault of Microsoft/Windows, because of changes they<br/>keep making in DirectX that are not backwards-compatible.</p><p>Even on my own Windows Vista laptop, on which Tonescape<br/>runs perfectly and looks absolutely gorgeous, there was<br/>one point at which an automatic Windows update broke Tonescape,<br/>and it wouldn&apos;t even start up. I had to do a restore to a<br/>backed-up version of Vista from before that update, and<br/>luckily i still had exactly _one_ version from before<br/>the update. So now Tonescape is working perfectly again.</p><p>... and Vista will never again be connected to the<br/>internet on that machine. So that&apos;s how i solve that<br/>problem: use Linux all the time on that machine unless<br/>i want to run Tonescape, then i use Windows Vista.</p><p>It&apos;s unfortunate that because we ran out of development<br/>money just when we needed it the most, my partner had<br/>to get a job which keeps him extremely busy, and he<br/>could no longer offer the support to users who had<br/>problems with installing Tonescape. And he is the<br/>only person on the planet who has the source code<br/>and knows how it works. Tonescape was entirely my<br/>idea, but he&apos;s the one who actually built it.</p><p>-monz<br/><a href="http://tonalsoft.com/tonescape.aspx">http://tonalsoft.com/tonescape.aspx</a><br/>Tonescape microtonal music software</p></div><h3><a id=82498 href="#82498">ðŸ”—</a>monz &#x3C;joemonz@...&#x3E;</h3><span>3/31/2009 2:11:56 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Hi Chris,</p><p>Thanks very much.</p><p>I still have copies of the old .html pages, but there&apos;s<br/>a lot that was changed in making the conversion to .aspx.<br/>I wouldn&apos;t really want to use the old pages again.</p><p>Anyway, i appreciate yours and Carl&apos;s offers.

If they had already made a significant<br/>&gt; amount of money and said material constituted a significant<br/>&gt; portion of the encyclopedia, the author might have a case to<br/>&gt; sue for some compensation.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I personally do not foresee taking any of these actions as<br/>&gt; an author, nor would I expect Paul, Gene, etc. to do so.<br/>&gt; My concern is what is best for this community.  If we have<br/>&gt; people monetizing content from this list, I think it&apos;s a<br/>&gt; disservice to the community.  If we miss out on the opportunity<br/>&gt; to create this wiki, that we&apos;ve talked about for so long<br/>&gt; but couldn&apos;t really do until now (with the hindsight we now<br/>&gt; have on what happened here &apos;99-06), that&apos;ll be a big loss.<br/>&gt; The tuning group is always changing, but over the past 1-2<br/>&gt; years it&apos;s changed more than usual, and it seems like a good<br/>&gt; time to make some next steps.</p><p>I&apos;ve said this before, but i will say it again ...</p><p>The Tonalsoft Encyclopedia is my creation, and the<br/>vast majority of the material in it is my own work.</p><p>I consider the quoted material by other authors to be<br/>in the nature of citations which support my main text,<br/>and they are always presented exactly as such, with<br/>author&apos;s name, tuning group message number, and timestamp,<br/>and the message number reference is almost always a link<br/>which points to the original source message itself in<br/>the yahoo groups archive.</p><p>I think our Terms of Use are pretty fair:<br/><a href="http://tonalsoft.com/terms.aspx">http://tonalsoft.com/terms.aspx</a></p><p>They give users and contributors plenty of options,<br/>including complete exclusion from our website<br/>if that is what&apos;s desired.</p><p>I&apos;m at least as interested in presenting the history<br/>of tuning, as i am about exploring the manifestations<br/>of new ideas in microtonality (or xenharmony).<br/>I&apos;m trying really hard to see the big picture, and<br/>with my interest in the Sumerians i feel that i&apos;ve<br/>at least gone back as far as i can in human history.</p><p>As i said, we envisioned transforming the static graphics<br/>which exist now on the current Encyclopedia pages<br/>into real-time animated-video-with-audio, illustrating<br/>particular topics in the world of tuning-theory and<br/>history.</p><p>These graphics would use a minimal version of<br/>Tonescape to produce the video and audio,<br/>running in the webpage, with all notes<br/>portrayed in both Pitch Height and Lattice video,<br/>and i would also include any available staff-notation<br/>and other diagrams.</p><p>Thus, the greatest strength of Tonescape<br/>-- its ability to represent musical data as, simultaneously:</p><p>* points in multi-dimensional genera in lattice-space,<br/>in one window</p><p>* lines representing pitch (vertical) and duration (horizontal)<br/>on a regular cartesian graph, in another window</p><p>* audio representing the particular tuning used in the<br/>.tonescape file and portrayed visually in the 2 windows,<br/>to the resolution of tuning available in the soundcard<br/>hardware</p><p>-- would be utilized on the webpages to illustrate<br/>particular examples being discussed in the webpage article.</p><p>Tonescape aims to bridge the gaps in the conceptions<br/>of tuning which were enforced by lack of technology<br/>in the pre-computer eras. It can show any possible<br/>conception of tuning -- whether a just-intonation,<br/>temperament, or something other -- within one frame<br/>of reference: the main navigation window which contains<br/>the Pitch-Height and Lattice windows and their accessory<br/>windows.</p><p>Tonescape takes advantage of the computer&apos;s ability<br/>to represent at least 3 very different experiences<br/>of music concurrently and in real-time.</p><p>I think all 3 of those representations are important<br/>and each has different aspects to illuminate in<br/>my quest to understand the effect and affect of tuning data<br/>on human emotional response to music.</p><p>I welcome and encourage everyone else to participate<br/>in that quest, on each person&apos;s own terms. We will<br/>always be willing to negotiate individual contracts fairly.</p><p>We strongly believe that Tonescape is an entirely unique<br/>new kind of software, and would like Tonalsoft to be a<br/>special force in the tuning community.<br/>I think that sums up our position.</p><p>-monz<br/><a href="http://tonalsoft.com/tonescape.aspx">http://tonalsoft.com/tonescape.aspx</a><br/>Tonescape microtonal music software</p></div><h3><a id=82511 href="#82511">ðŸ”—</a>Carl Lumma &#x3C;carl@...&#x3E;</h3><span>4/1/2009 12:11:59 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;monz&quot; &lt;joemonz@...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I&apos;ve said this before, but i will say it again ...<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; The Tonalsoft Encyclopedia is my creation, and the<br/>&gt; vast majority of the material in it is my own work.<br/>&gt; I consider the quoted material by other authors to be<br/>&gt; in the nature of citations which support my main text,</p><p>I&apos;m afraid I can&apos;t agree with this assessment, monz,<br/>but I won&apos;t argue about it here.

In the composition process, the software can generate an explicit harmonic structure (quasi a harmonic analysis) which restricts the actual note pitches (e.g. note pitch classes are either harmonic tones of their related chord, or non-harmonic tones which are specially treated, e.g., stepwise resolved). So, as I have the underlying harmonic structure anyway, I can then use it for adaptive JI. (I also have some first promising results in automatic analysis of existing music, but that matter is unfinished)</p><p>I generalised Vicentino&apos;s idea in the following way. The root of a chord is tuned as defined by the current tuning table (by default an ET depending on the current number of notes per octave, but the user can freely define it, in a format similar to the Scala scale format). In other words: the root is left tempered. Any non-root chord tone is tuned using this chord root and the note&apos;s respective ratio specified for the related chord: all possible chords are specified in a list with features such as untransposed root and untransposed pitch classes. These features can be ratios, but also integer pitch classes (in which case adaptive JI will leave them the pitch of the tuning table -- so you can have progressions of both JI chords and tempered chords). Finally, non-chord tones are tuned using again the related chord&apos;s root and a mapping of the pitch class interval between this tone and the related chord root to JI intervals (e.g., in 31 ET, 18 maps to 3/2). Alternatively, non-chord tones can also follow the tuning table.</p><p>I did some tests with decatonic chord progressions (e.g., using Erlich&apos;s dynamic symmetrical major): quite a difference compared with 22 ET :)</p><p>Best<br/>Torsten</p><p>PS: Just in case: the model described is currently only available in the SVN repository, the last release contains an older version.</p><p>--<br/>Torsten Anders<br/>Interdisciplinary Centre for Computer Music Research<br/>University of Plymouth<br/>Office: +44-1752-586219<br/>Private: +44-1752-558917<br/><a href="http://strasheela.sourceforge.net">http://strasheela.sourceforge.net</a><br/><a href="http://www.torsten-anders.de">http://www.torsten-anders.de</a></p></div><h3><a id=82543 href="#82543">ðŸ”—</a>monz &#x3C;joemonz@...&#x3E;</h3><span>4/1/2009 3:46:58 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Hi Torsten,</p><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, Torsten Anders &lt;torsten.anders@...&gt; wrote:</p><p>&gt; I take it you also considered using Mono?

These features can be ratios, but also integer pitch classes<br/>&gt; (in which case adaptive JI will leave them the pitch of the tuning<br/>&gt; table -- so you can have progressions of both JI chords and tempered<br/>&gt; chords). Finally, non-chord tones are tuned using again the related<br/>&gt; chord&apos;s root and a mapping of the pitch class interval between this<br/>&gt; tone and the related chord root to JI intervals (e.g., in 31 ET, 18<br/>&gt; maps to 3/2).

The exact amount depends on the underlying tuning table for the bass, it is -11.6 cent for 22 ET.

It might be interesting to minimise the size of these by selecting a different tuning table for the bass, though I lack the tuning math required for doing so. This tuning table would probably try to equally distribute the errors for all JI intervals involved (at least for all 7-limit intervals of the decatonic scales). If I understand it correctly, this would be something like the opposite of the RMS optimisation (so using Pajara optimised this way is not really a good idea, I only made these examples to show the effect of changing the underlying tuning table).
