I have seen SCALA used in DOS but has no MAC version. Is<br/>there other software which enables me to specify scale degrees of a<br/>given equal-division and compile them into a file?<br/> If you can point me to a general site where I can look for info, that<br/>would be helpful as well, for I am new to this world. (but i was not<br/>born yesterday.)</p><p>Thanks.</p></div>
