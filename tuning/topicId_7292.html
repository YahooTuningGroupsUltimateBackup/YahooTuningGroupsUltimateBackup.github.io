OK,<br/>it needn&apos;t be all 24 keys in the two octaves, but that would be nice. It<br/>would also be nice if the LCD on the face of the keyboard had a setting<br/>that showed the CPS of the fundamental I&apos;m playing when I play a single<br/>key.  I really don&apos;t need any more than, say, 10 keys-at-a-time playing<br/>capabilities. (A nice durable, easily-repairable machine would be good,<br/>too.) The limit is $3000.
