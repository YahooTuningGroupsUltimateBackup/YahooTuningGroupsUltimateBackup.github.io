The hypothesis that organ builder<br/>Frans Caspar Schnitger tuned the organ in this modern way as early<br/>as 1725, however, turns out to be incorrect; Schnitger used the<br/>standard temperament of those days, which means that the organ had<br/>a traditional meantone temperament with pure thirds. This fact is<br/>corroborated by the history of the pitch of organs; by the history<br/>of music, which shows that organs were used in combination with<br/>other instrument, making it obligatory for the organist to<br/>transpose every now and then; and by the fact that the meantone<br/>temperament was the standard temperament to the Northern German<br/>organ building tradition to which Schnitger belonged.</p><p>The Alkmaar organ was built in 1646 by the organ builders Van<br/>Hagerbeer.

He published about this plan extensively. Jacob Wognum<br/>and Aeneas E. Veldcamps, who both preferred the Dutch organ<br/>building tradition, protested.

It turns out that Havingha wasn&apos;t the<br/>advocate of equal tempered organs that he has been said to be; he<br/>described the meantone temperament of the Alkmaar organ before<br/>Schnitger worked on it, calling it, as was common in those days,<br/>&apos;pure harmony&apos;, and he used these same words as well in the<br/>examination report of 1725. Veldcamps referred to that report, and<br/>confirmed that the organ was tuned just like any other Dutch<br/>organ, with the consent of Havingha: the instrument had meantone<br/>temperament, with &apos;eight pure thirds&apos;.</p><p>Havingha had suggested a different temperament for the Schnitger<br/>organ at Zwolle (1721). This fact also played a role in the<br/>&apos;Alkmaar organ battle&apos;.
