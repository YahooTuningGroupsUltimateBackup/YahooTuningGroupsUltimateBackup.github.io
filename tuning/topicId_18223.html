It is very<br/>useful to have your chosen name reserved: it becomes like a permanent<br/>phone number where you can always be reached, no matter where your<br/>actual web pages and/or e-mail server are located at any given moment.<br/>Very nice!</p><p>JdL</p></div><h3>Todd Wilcox &#x3C;twilcox@patriot.net&#x3E;</h3><span>2/2/2001 10:38:17 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Daniel Wolf wrote:<br/>&gt; This is totally off-topic, but can anyone recommend an<br/>&gt; inexpensive domain<br/>&gt; name registration service?</p><p>Other notables are <a href="http://www.networksolutions.com">www.networksolutions.com</a> and <a href="http://www.register.com">www.register.com</a>.</p><p>I think <a href="http://register.com">register.com</a> is probably easier to manage for a private user,<br/>although I prefer NSI for all my work-related domain management, they&apos;re a<br/>little better at letting you manage huge numbers of domains.</p><p>Todd</p></div>
