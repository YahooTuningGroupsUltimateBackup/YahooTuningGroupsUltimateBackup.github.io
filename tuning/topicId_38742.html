The latter was a resounding success,<br/>more on that and guitar tuning later but the good news today is that there is<br/>at last a commercially available Jazz CD which features two pianos,  a Yamaha<br/>C6 and Kawai RX3, both tuned in my own design known as Equal Beating<br/>Victorian Temperament (EBVT) with Tempered Octaves. (See my website through<br/>the link below for more information)</p><p>The artist is Roscoe Mitchell and the Note Factory.  The title of the CD is<br/>&quot;Song for my Sister&quot;.  I was indeed given credit for my work in the liner<br/>notes.</p><p>There are two ways to order:  directly from the distributor or from<br/><a href="http://Amazon.com">Amazon.com</a>.</p><p>To order from the distributor, Pi Recordings:</p><p><a href="http://www.pirecordings.com/flash/main.html">http://www.pirecordings.com/flash/main.html</a></p><p>To order from <a href="http://Amazon.com">Amazon.com</a>:</p><p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B000068CZ8/qid%3D1027978498/sr%3D11-1/r">http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B000068CZ8/qid%3D1027978498/sr%3D11-1/r</a></p><p>ef%3Dsr%5F11%5F1/102-0542581-3432913</p><p>The music may not be for everybody but I have enjoyed it quite a bit so far.<br/>It is also not the ideal example to try to pick apart and analyze the<br/>difference between the standard way of tuning the modern piano and the way I<br/>have done now for 10 years.  It does however, demonstrate that modern Jazz<br/>does not really require Equal Temperament (ET) as so many people assume.</p><p>Below is the review from <a href="http://Amazon.com">Amazon.com</a>.

A founding member of the &lt;A HREF=&quot;<a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ts/artist-glance/53155/102-0542581-3432913">http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ts/artist-glance/53155/102-0542581-3432913</a>&quot;&gt;Art Ensemble of Chicago&lt;/A&gt; and the equally<br/>influential Association for the Advancement of Creative Musicians, Mitchell<br/>is often associated with the kind of bombastic free jazz that the Art<br/>Ensemble pioneered in the 1960s--but as the wonderfully varied Song for My<br/>Sister proves, that&apos;s not a fair categorization of his broad composing and<br/>improvising talents. Recorded with the Note Factory, Mitchell&apos;s nine- piece<br/>double-trio ensemble (two bassists, two drummers, two pianists), Song for My<br/>Sister opens with the lyrical title track, a swinging modal workout that<br/>wouldn&apos;t sound out of place on John Coltrane&apos;s &lt;A HREF=&quot;<a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B00004WK0U/102-0542581-3432913">http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B00004WK0U/102-0542581-3432913</a>&quot;&gt;Ol&eacute;&lt;/A&gt;. From there Mitchell dips<br/>into several of his many musical personalities: &quot;This,&quot; a beautiful<br/>chamber-music piece originally set to one of e.e. cummings&apos;s poems that<br/>utilizes Mitchell&apos;s bass and great bass recorders; the percussion-and-piano<br/>&quot;The Megaplexian,&quot; which echoes Indonesian gamelan music; and some thrilling<br/>rides into free improvisation on &quot;Sagitta&quot; and &quot;When the Whistle Blows.&quot; Song<br/>for My Sister certainly doesn&apos;t fit into the neat categories that mark many<br/>major-label jazz releases these days--a fact that both longtime and recent<br/>fans of Mitchell&apos;s nearly 40-year career will find heartening. --Ezra Gale&gt;&gt;</p><p>Bill Bremmer RPT<br/>Madison, Wisconsin<br/> &lt;A HREF=&quot;<a href="http://www.billbremmer.com/">http://www.billbremmer.com/</a>&quot;&gt;Click here: -=w w w . b i l l b r e m m e r . c o m =-&lt;/A&gt;</p></div>
