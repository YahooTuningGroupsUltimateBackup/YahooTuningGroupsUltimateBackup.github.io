The bends I use when playing the blues have nothing to<br/>do with ratios and that&apos;s fine with me. But think about the many points in<br/>history where quantification led to musical progress -- the Renaissance,<br/>Werckmeister, Partch . . . As a mathematician/physicist, my mind is<br/>naturally drawn to such questions, and it would seem to be a great benefit<br/>to Jerry&apos;s cause to be able to put numbers on what he&apos;s hearing so that<br/>scholars of the future won&apos;t have to play a guessing game when reading his<br/>books.</p></div><h3><a id=8834 href="#8834">ðŸ”—</a>Gerald Eskelin &#x3C;stg3music@earthlink.net&#x3E;</h3><span>2/25/2000 11:26:57 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>John Szanto exasperatedly posted:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Look boys:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I&apos;m all for the back-and-forth nature of the medium, but sometimes people<br/>&gt; of sound body and mind have to agree to disagree.</p><p>That phase comes when both parties are satisfied that they have understood<br/>the other. We are not quite there yet, but I sense we are close.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;    (or at least agree to realize that they are talking past each other)</p><p>The way one finds out they are &quot;talking past each other&quot; is to challenge and<br/>question. I think we have been doing that rather successfully recently. At<br/>very least, it is a demonstration on how to be both honestly brutal and<br/>mutually respectful at the same time. The world could use more of that.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;      [or take it off-list??]</p><p>You may have noticed that more members are getting into the conversation.<br/>That&apos;s what the List is all about. If you have no interest in this thread,<br/>Jon, use your down-arrow (or delete) when you see the topic.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; But what iced the cake for me was Paul writing the following:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt;It is therefore of great interest to me to understand<br/>&gt;&gt;tuning as it works for you, and to help put a quantitative underpinning to<br/>&gt;&gt;the things you hear.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; [explitive deleted] Nonsense! (I took the last one directly from &quot;Paul<br/>&gt; Erlich&apos;s Guide to Effective Communication&quot;) -- Dear Paul, some of us in<br/>&gt; this world don&apos;t want things to have &quot;a quantitative underpinning&quot; (well, I<br/>&gt; like to know that a given plumbing fixture will work with my sink, but<br/>&gt; that&apos;s another topic). If that is the *only* way you can understand music,<br/>&gt; or at least some subset of music, then I actually feel sorry for you.</p><p>Jon, I joined the List to do just that: to find an objective description for<br/>what I have observed in &quot;real life&quot; and its mysteries. Ironically, I am very<br/>close to leaving having learned that there is little chance that the &quot;high<br/>third&quot; can be quantified in a reasonable manner. Is that a positive thing?<br/>It is to me! Is that progress? Yes, it is. Is that what this List is all<br/>about?????? Your answer, please..............<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; But I *do* believe that you *do* feel music more on a gut level as well<br/>&gt; (you better feel klezmer that way, buddy), and I sure wish you could just<br/>&gt; let it affect you in that manner, let it affect others in that manner, and<br/>&gt; quit trying to put everything in measurable compartments.</p><p>One&apos;s concern for understanding human perception has no relationship to<br/>one&apos;s appreciation for the emotional effects of artistic expression. We now<br/>know why apples fall from trees, but that doesn&apos;t detract from the beauty of<br/>the tree itself, not to mention a well-shaped apple.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I realize I&apos;m probably *way* out of line here,</p><p>Honest expressions of frustration are never out of line, Jon. We all have<br/>been there (see my recent posts). But fortunately, we wake up the next<br/>morning and realize how really silly it all was. Perhaps you will, too.</p><p>&gt; but this thing has been<br/>&gt; going on with no sense of resolution for a looooong time now. Over and over<br/>&gt; and over.</p><p>I apologize for the extraneous (and perhaps detracting) side issues that<br/>have been personally enjoyable but not of interest to all (and perhaps Paul<br/>would join me on that). On the other hand, one never knows what off-hand<br/>comment will generate a breakthrough. It&apos;s all part of the process of<br/>discovery. Remember, this is not a finished &quot;book,&quot; its the banging out of<br/>the basic ideas that perhaps will at some point find their way into a more<br/>&quot;polite&quot; presentation.</p><p>&gt; For me, &quot;let us give to nuts and bolts the standardization of<br/>&gt; thread that we have come to expect, but let us give to music -- magic, to<br/>&gt; man -- magic.&quot;</p><p>Right on, brother!<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Notice: I said &quot;For me&quot;; YMMV.</p><p>Duly noted.</p><p>Thanks for your bold honesty, Jon.</p><p>Jerry</p></div>
