I&apos;ve just added <a href="http://k082.zip">k082.zip</a> to my web:</p><p>   <a href="http://www.idcomm.com/personal/jadl/">http://www.idcomm.com/personal/jadl/</a></p><p>containing tunings of Domenico Scarlatti Sonata in F, K.082, sequenced<br/>by John Sankey.  As presented by Mr. Sankey, the tunings are fixed at:</p><p>      E3 1F 3D (-8.72)   Eb<br/>      EB 30 3E (-5.14)   Bb<br/>      E5 30 3F (-1.98)   F<br/>      E0 00 40 (0.00)    C<br/>      E7 7E 3E (-3.21)   G<br/>      E2 70 3D (-6.72)   D<br/>      EA 30 3C (-11.47)  A<br/>      E4 50 3B (-13.84)  E<br/>      EC 57 3B (-13.67)  B<br/>      E6 0F 3B (-15.45)  F#<br/>      E1 32 3B (-14.58)  C#<br/>      E8 00 3C (-12.65)  G#</p><p>Which is not particularly well suited to this particular piece.  I threw<br/>5-limit COFT at it, and got:</p><p>      E3 6B 46  (For pitch  3, we have bend  21.6392)<br/>      EB 7C 44  (For pitch 10, we have bend  15.7220)<br/>      E5 58 43  (For pitch  5, we have bend  11.6660)<br/>      E0 79 42  (For pitch  0, we have bend   9.3285)<br/>      E7 1C 42  (For pitch  7, we have bend   7.0378)<br/>      E2 4B 40  (For pitch  2, we have bend   1.8604)<br/>      EA 19 3F  (For pitch  9, we have bend  -2.5590)<br/>      E4 2B 3E  (For pitch  4, we have bend  -5.2652)<br/>      EC 19 3D  (For pitch 11, we have bend  -8.8818)<br/>      E6 2E 3B  (For pitch  6, we have bend -14.6857)<br/>      E1 2F 3A  (For pitch  1, we have bend -17.8358)<br/>      E8 27 3A  (For pitch  8, we have bend -18.0264)</p><p>But was very surprised to find that the total &quot;pain&quot; tallied by COFT<br/>was only 10% less than for the 31-tET subset, Eb thru G#.  The COFT<br/>values closely track meantone, with sharply narrowed fifths all along<br/>the line.  I&apos;m not quite sure why this is, except for the observation<br/>that minor thirds tend to pull fifths narrow even more than major thirds<br/>do.</p><p>JdL</p></div><h3>John A. deLaubenfels &#x3C;jadl@idcomm.com&#x3E;</h3><span>6/11/2000 12:19:17 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>[I wrote:]<br/>&gt;&gt;I thought that, the older the music, the better COFT would be against<br/>&gt;&gt;meantone, but I was wrong!</p><p>[Paul Erlich:]<br/>&gt;Why would you have thought that?</p><p>[I:]<br/>&gt;&gt;The COFT<br/>&gt;&gt;values closely track meantone, with sharply narrowed fifths all along<br/>&gt;&gt;the line. I&apos;m not quite sure why this is</p><p>[Paul:]<br/>&gt;Well, meantone was basically designed to be a COFT for music using 7 or<br/>&gt;more consecutive notes on the chain of fifths. Scarlatti&apos;s music<br/>&gt;certainly falls into that category, as does most of the music that<br/>&gt;preceded him since the invention of meantone.</p><p>&gt;Or was there something in particular that made the meantone result<br/>&gt;surprising?</p><p>Well... the truth is, I never realized just to what extent meantone IS<br/>COFT (or a fairly close approximation thereof) for certain music.<br/>All of a sudden I appreciate meantone more than I did before.</p><p>I made up a test sequence with a mix of two-note intervals in the range<br/>Eb ...  G#:</p><p>   Eb Bb  F  C  G  D  A  E  B  F#  C#  G#<br/>    3 10  5  0  7  2  9  4 11   6  1   8</p><p>having 11 sequential fifths (Eb and Bb, Bb and F, ... C# and G#),<br/>then 9 sequential minor thirds (Eb and C ... B and G#), then 8<br/>sequential major thirds (Eb and G ... E and G#).   All intervals are<br/>made to be the same weight.</p><p>The sequence doesn&apos;t cross the wolf at all.
