Who cares if <a href="http://MP3.com">MP3.com</a> survives?<br/>Like I posted yesterday, I&apos;ve got some MP3 files up on a<br/>site if anyone has the bandwidth to down load them. And as<br/>time marches on the technology becomes more widespread.<br/>There was once a time when people had email but not web access<br/>and that&apos;s not the story today. Increasingly as people get<br/>faster connctions like cable modems (I&apos;ve had one for a year),<br/>downloading large media isn&apos;t a problem. You can<br/>always use a search engine like Excite! to look for keywords<br/>like microtones or just intonation.</p><p>I&apos;m more worried about the new Korg MS2000 4 voice analog<br/>modeling synth. The Keyboard magazine synth sez it&apos;s tunable,<br/>but the Korg web site isn&apos;t that specific. A trip to 48th<br/>Street will hopefully answer this question in the morning.</p><p>--<br/>* D a v i d         B e a r d s l e y<br/>*           <a href="mailto:xouoxno@virtulink.com">xouoxno@virtulink.com</a><br/>*<br/>* 49/32  R a d i o &quot;all microtonal, all the time&quot;<br/>* M E L A  v i r t u a l  d r e a m house monitor<br/>*<br/>* <a href="http://www.virtulink.com/immp/lookhere.htm">http://www.virtulink.com/immp/lookhere.htm</a></p></div>
