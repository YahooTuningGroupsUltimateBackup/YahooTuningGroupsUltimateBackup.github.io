When I did a FA in Mathematica on the wave in question (and others) it gave the usual infinite F series harmonics 1,2,...with small amplitudes except at a and b, as expected. What&apos;s going on here is that, given that the peaks occur at t = (2k + 1)/2(a + b),  there are significant peaks at certain times that are characteristic of each interval. The first is always at k = 0. The next occurs at k = K and is characteristic of each pair (a, b) (which I&apos;ll get to). The approx GCD = (a + b)/K. Now, the wave has period T = K/(a + b) *only at these times*, that is t = [1/(a + b)] + [NK/(a + b)], N = 0,1,2,...The wave doesn&apos;t have this period for any in between times. Therefore it is neither strictly periodic or aperiodic. (Or is it &apos;almost periodic&apos;?) So to test this I tried isolating one period, repeated it and put it to a FT. But all it gave was an infinite FS with large contributions from a and b.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Again, given that (a, b) are coprime, sin(2pi*at) + sin(2pi*bt) =<br/>&gt; 2sin(pi(a + b)t)cos(pi(a - b)t), the maxima of this wave satisfy<br/>&gt; &gt; 2sin(pi(a + b)t)cos(pi(a - b)t) = (+ or -) 2cos(pi(a - b)t) giving<br/>&gt; &gt; sin (pi(a + b)t) = (+ or -)1.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I don&apos;t get this jump here, can you explain? Why would the maxima<br/>&gt; satisfy that equation?</p><p>Because the envelope is (+or-)2cos(pi(a - b)t). The original wave and this meet only at extrema and finding the times when this occurs requires solving the simultaneous equation given above.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; Solving for time gives t = (2k + 1)/2(a + b) where k = 0,1,2... The first largest maxima occurs at K = 0 and t = 1/2(a + b). The second occurs at k = (p + q), where p and q are the corresponding JI interval, and t = 2(p + q)/2(a + b). The difference is T = (p + q)/(a + b) and ~ GCD = 1/T. Since (p + q) is whole then whole numbered multiples of it will also belong to the set k. IOW this period will continue throughout the wave starting from the initial time.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I don&apos;t have MATLAB on this computer to test that but I&apos;ll assume<br/>&gt; you&apos;re right. So your goal is to find the maxima of these functions<br/>&gt; and then show that they are &quot;nearly&quot; the maxima of some simpler<br/>&gt; function, right?</p><p>Something like that. Yesterday I said that I couldn&apos;t find a proof. But today something occurred to me. The integer K in ~ GCD = (a + b)/K is *given*. For 81/64 for eg it is K = 9. And from here we can now deduce our &apos;simpler&apos; interval p/q as follows. Taking the ratio (interval) between our original freq&apos;s and this gives aK/(a + b) and bK/(a + b). These can be put in the &apos;quotient-remainder&apos; form<br/>aK/(a + b) = p + R/(a + b),<br/>bK/(a + b) = q - R/(a + b)<br/>where R = aq - pb. For a/b = 81/64,(a + b) = 145, p = 5, q = 4 and R = 4.<br/>Adding the two values above we get K = (p + q), here 5 + 4 = 9. Thus, our approx GCD becomes (a + b)/(p + q). Finally the original intervals a and b can be regarded as slightly detuned 5th and 4th harmonics, respectively, of this &apos;fundamental&apos;. More precisely, p*(a + b)/(p + q) = a - R and q*(a + b)/(p + q) = b + R. Interestingly, this holds for irrational intervals as well. For eg, if we take the tempered major third a = 64*2^(1/3) = 80.63494...and b = 64 then everything just said holds.</p><p>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; This frequency isn&apos;t revealed by a Fourier Analysis. It&apos;s maxima are not all equal, nor are the values of the function in between. But this is not to say that the wave itself is not Fourier analysable.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; WHAT frequency? The frequency of the sin (pi(a + b)t) term? No, it<br/>&gt; won&apos;t appear as an impulse in the Fourier transform of the wave, but<br/>&gt; its existence can be clearly deduced by finding the two spikes on the<br/>&gt; transformed curve, getting the distance between them, and dividing by<br/>&gt; two, as you have done mathematically here.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; Now the remaining problem is to find out WHY k = (p + q) in a rigorous mathematical sense. Even though I&apos;ve tested many examples, including totally random ones, and they all surprisingly give the expected result, I&apos;m still at a loss to find *the* mathematical proof for it. As I mentioned, it also works for when a is an irrational interval from b. (p and q are still whole since they are members of the integers k) But this so far is still just an observation, not a proof. So why don&apos;t you work with me to help find this proof instead of going over old ground?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I&apos;d be happy to, but I&apos;m not going to get into this notion that<br/>&gt; Fourier Analysis is &quot;incomplete.&quot; It&apos;s a completely linear transform<br/>&gt; and is as &quot;complete&quot; as the rest of mathematics. I don&apos;t think you<br/>&gt; understand what the concept of a &quot;virtual fundamental&quot; really is, or<br/>&gt; else you wouldn&apos;t be so adamant that is &quot;wrong&quot; (it most certainly is<br/>&gt; not and is not incompatible with anything you&apos;re doing here).<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; The difference is that most theories so far have been working in the<br/>&gt; frequency domain, and you are working in the time domain here. That<br/>&gt; being said, everything you&apos;re doing would have a comparable frequency<br/>&gt; domain analysis as well.</p><p>I hope what I said above has made this clearer. Unless I&apos;m mistaken, it&apos;s not a &apos;frequency&apos; in the strict Fourier sense and therefore won&apos;t be revealed within the Freq domain. Long before I ever heard of virtual pitch I was convinced that GCD, which is actually the frequency of the wave, explained tonality. But I was stumped at how we could go from say 80/64 with GCD 16 to 81/64 with GCD 1. This I think solves that problem. Now I can look back on my previous GCD work and generalise it. Observe for eg how GCD&apos;s can create their own Fourier Series where they are analysed into GCD&apos;s and not sine waves, in a manner of speaking. 6 and 9 have GCD = 3 and are the 2 and 3 harmonics. Taking the harmonic series of each gives 6, 12, 18, 24...and 9, 18, 27, 36...But these have GCD&apos;s 3, 6, 9, 12... which are themselves harmonics of the GCD; GCD of (12, 18) = 6 = 2 x 3 etc... IOW we could consider this a series where our &apos;fundamental&apos; or &apos;element&apos; is say SUM [0-&gt;N] [sin(2piN6t) + sin(2piN9t)] rather than a single sine wave. From this point of view, a single sine wave might be considered as just one special case (of course we could further analyse to sine waves but that&apos;s not my point).</p><p>If I&apos;ve got virtual pitch all wrong then I apologise in advance for what I&apos;m about to say. Please feel free to correct me. But I simply find it hard to believe that the ear or brain has some special innate capacity to just invent fundamentals that are not there in the wave somehow. It seems illogical and unnatural to me. Or if it sometimes does imagine stuff then I still figure that the brain/mind must be responding to *something*. I prefer to believe that we can sometimes simply hear the frequency or near frequency directly, that it is as real as the sine waves that go into making it, that single sine waves are just one special case (the greater set being the GCD&apos;s or approx ones) and that musical tonality has this basis in reality. And fully aware of the difficulties inherent in all aesthetics, the murky ground between perception and expectation, sensation and thought, I just can&apos;t help the feeling that psychoacoustics interpreted the facts to &quot;match&quot; the theory, that they had sine waves in the mind prior to experiment and followed the logical trail. As I said earlier this year, can you or anyone actually *prove* that we don&apos;t hear the GCD or approx GCD, that we&apos;re not responding to objective stimuli? To prove that its in the mind would require destroying the wave in the process. Sure, Terhardt says that we cannot have virtual pitch without at least one spectral component. But I find this distinction itself weighted towards sine waves, &quot;spectral&quot; = real = sine waves. At any rate, I suspect that the general &apos;scientific&apos; belief that art is subjective destroyed any motive or willpower to look for alternate explanations.</p><p>-Rick<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Therefore I disagree with the view that FA is complete. Yet it doesn&apos;t contradict FA either. While the theory of Almost periodic functions comes close (and will probably play some part yet), I&apos;ve never come across any scientist who has even touched on this particular theory, let alone solved it. IOW its probably the humble beginnings of a new *scientific* theory. Have I ever said anything different?<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; I don&apos;t understand what you mean by this. What particular theory?<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; You&apos;ll note that if let the two intervals mentioned run on long<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; enough, that they do end up diverging. How close is &quot;close enough&quot; for them to be considered equivalent?<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; What two intervals? I&apos;m not simply &apos;comparing&apos; an 81/64 with a 5/4 for eg but saying directly that the former wave *already* contains slightly detuned cycles of the latter. For this example, (a + b)/(p + q) = 145/9 = 16.111..., 64/(64.111..) = 4 - (4/145) and 81/(64.111..) = 5 + (4/145). Since the ear/brain does not perceive or need to perceive every cycle of a wave, then the theory is that sub-harmonic matching does seem to have some physical basis in wave theory.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Of course it does. However, an actual sinusoid at the subharmonic<br/>&gt; frequency where the periods sync up will not exist. And so the nerve<br/>&gt; endings that correspond to that frequency in the cochlea will not get<br/>&gt; stimulated. However, your brain will perform a very similar<br/>&gt; mathematical analysis to what you&apos;re doing here (finding repeating<br/>&gt; maxima) and find its existence that way, and &quot;create&quot; the sound for<br/>&gt; you to hear it.

But I was stumped at how we could go from say 80/64 with GCD 16 to 81/64 with GCD 1. This I think solves that problem. Now I can look back on my previous GCD work and generalise it. Observe for eg how GCD&apos;s can create their own Fourier Series where they are analysed into GCD&apos;s and not sine waves, in a manner of speaking. 6 and 9 have GCD = 3 and are the 2 and 3 harmonics. Taking the harmonic series of each gives 6, 12, 18, 24...and 9, 18, 27, 36...But these have GCD&apos;s 3, 6, 9, 12... which are themselves harmonics of the GCD; GCD of (12, 18) = 6 = 2 x 3 etc... IOW we could consider this a series where our &apos;fundamental&apos; or &apos;element&apos; is say SUM [0-&gt;N] [sin(2piN6t) + sin(2piN9t)] rather than a single sine wave. From this point of view, a single sine wave might be considered as just one special case (of course we could further analyse to sine waves but that&apos;s not my point).<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; The idea is that the brain creates a &quot;virtual pitch&quot; that corresponds<br/>&gt; to something close to the GCD of the wave coming in. But since the<br/>&gt; auditory system doesn&apos;t have until infinity to see what the real GCD<br/>&gt; of two sinusoids is, it just takes a small chunk of time instead. This<br/>&gt; chunk of time or &quot;window size&quot; I believe would most likely be<br/>&gt; frequency dependent, which explains the recent trend in using wavelets<br/>&gt; instead of the STFT in analyzing sound.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; But I don&apos;t think this is really going to explain all of tonality. For<br/>&gt; example, this would break down for a 10:12:15 chord. The root of a<br/>&gt; 10:12:15 chord is almost always heard as 5, not 1.

Now I can look<br/>&gt; &gt; back on my previous GCD work and generalise it. Observe for eg how GCD&apos;s can<br/>&gt; &gt; create their own Fourier Series where they are analysed into GCD&apos;s and not<br/>&gt; &gt; sine waves, in a manner of speaking. 6 and 9 have GCD = 3 and are the 2 and<br/>&gt; &gt; 3 harmonics.

IOW we could<br/>&gt; &gt; consider this a series where our &apos;fundamental&apos; or &apos;element&apos; is say SUM<br/>&gt; &gt; [0-&gt;N] [sin(2piN6t) + sin(2piN9t)] rather than a single sine wave. From this<br/>&gt; &gt; point of view, a single sine wave might be considered as just one special<br/>&gt; &gt; case (of course we could further analyse to sine waves but that&apos;s not my<br/>&gt; &gt; point).<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; The idea is that the brain creates a &quot;virtual pitch&quot; that corresponds<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; to something close to the GCD of the wave coming in. But since the<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; auditory system doesn&apos;t have until infinity to see what the real GCD<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; of two sinusoids is, it just takes a small chunk of time instead. This<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; chunk of time or &quot;window size&quot; I believe would most likely be<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; frequency dependent, which explains the recent trend in using wavelets<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; instead of the STFT in analyzing sound.<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; But I don&apos;t think this is really going to explain all of tonality.

But since the<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; auditory system doesn&apos;t have until infinity to see what the real GCD<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; of two sinusoids is, it just takes a small chunk of time instead. This<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; chunk of time or &quot;window size&quot; I believe would most likely be<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; frequency dependent, which explains the recent trend in using wavelets<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; instead of the STFT in analyzing sound.<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; But I don&apos;t think this is really going to explain all of tonality. For<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; example, this would break down for a 10:12:15 chord. The root of a<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; 10:12:15 chord is almost always heard as 5, not 1. This is because<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; each dyad of the chord has its own &quot;GCD&quot; and the one produced by 10:15<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; is going to be stronger than the rest of them, with the 12:15 one<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; coming in at a close second.<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; It should be noted that you are using the term &quot;GCD&quot; here in the same<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; way that everyone else is using the term &quot;virtual fundamental,&quot; but<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; for some reason you swear you&apos;re talking about something else.<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I prefer to believe that we can sometimes simply hear the frequency or<br/>&gt; &gt; near frequency directly, that it is as real as the sine waves that go into<br/>&gt; &gt; making it, that single sine waves are just one special case (the greater set<br/>&gt; &gt; being the GCD&apos;s or approx ones) and that musical tonality has this basis in<br/>&gt; &gt; reality.<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; The reason that it&apos;s called virtual is, again, that two pressure waves<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; at frequencies 400 Hz and 500 Hz simply will not make the region of<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; the cochlea corresponding to 100 Hz resonate. Your brain simply<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; recreates it based off of the periodicity information in the signal.<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; And since the people who discovered this can call it whatever they<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; want, they went with &quot;virtual pitch&quot; instead. Or &quot;phantom<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; fundamental,&quot; or &quot;missing fundamental,&quot; or &quot;virtual fundamental,&quot; or<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; any one of those.<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; -Mike<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt;</p></div><h3>martinsj013 &#x3C;martinsj@...&#x3E;</h3><span>4/27/2010 9:00:50 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;rick&quot; &lt;rick_ballan@...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;...As mentioned, the two largest maxima in the wave sin (2pi a*t) + sin (2pi b*t) is T = (p + q)/(a + b).

I&apos;ll get to your other questions in a sec. Concerning doubts as to the derivation, this is not the problem. There&apos;s no doubt here. You can check it yourself again if you like (I&apos;ll drop the 2pi as Mike suggested. I&apos;ll also present it from the beginning because people are coming in half way and misunderstanding).</p><p>1. f(t) = sin[at] + sin[bt] = 2sin[(a + b)t/2]cos[(a - b)t/2].<br/>2. Envelope is +/- 2cos[(a - b)t/2].<br/>3. Extrema occurs when f(t) equals envelope:<br/>2sin[(a + b)t/2]cos[(a - b)t/2] = +/- 2cos[(a - b)t/2] or<br/>sin[(a + b)t/2] = +/- 1.<br/>4. Solving for t gives t = (2k + 1)/2(a + b), k = 0,1,2...</p><p>First maxima occurs at t = 1/2(a + b). Therefore the period between this and the other extrema is given by<br/>5. T = (2k + 1)/2(a + b) - 1/2(a + b) = k/(a + b).</p><p>Everything said so far is mathematically correct. It&apos;s finding the &apos;target&apos; cycle, mathematically, that presents the problem i.e. essentially finding &apos;k&apos;.</p><p>You know how I guessed at them. By comparing the waves with their &apos;JI counterparts&apos; (say, ratio p/q) and noting where the maxima&apos;s approximately coincide, the values *always* gave k = p + q. 32/27 gives k = 11 = 5 + 6, 81/64 gives k = 9 = 4 + 5 etc...Now, once k is known it is easy to deduce p and q.</p><p>6. Assuming that (a + b)/k is our &apos;fundamental&apos; then dividing the original frequencies by this gives</p><p>ak/(a + b) = p + r/(a + b), bk/(a + b) = q - r/(a + b) where r = aq - pb. [Technically speaking, p is the &apos;floor&apos; of ak/(a + b) and q is the &apos;ceiling&apos; of bk/(a + b). I&apos;ve since learned that if we go through successive values of k = 1,2,3,...then not all the convergents are in there. Only the &apos;target&apos; one&apos;s are, which means I&apos;m getting somewhere].</p><p>7. Multiplying (a + b)/k and adding gives k = (p + q) and ~ GCD = (a + b)/(p + q).</p><p>Therefore this result is correct. It&apos;s finding the conditions to arrive at &apos;k&apos; (or &apos;k&apos;s) that&apos;s the problem. Interestingly your product formula below does put us in close to the expected values as well. Why this is I don&apos;t know either.</p><p>But about your expectation that p/q = 6/5 should point to the same fundamental as its inverse p/q = 5/3, well they do approximately. Once we have accepted that there&apos;s a &apos;give&apos; around the intervals and noting that ~ GCD doesn&apos;t mean real GCD then this is to be expected. 6 x (59/11) = 32.1818..., dividing 2 gives 16.0909... or 3 x (43/8) = 16.125 and x 2 gives 32.25. And of course 59/11 = 5.3636 ~= 43/8 = 5.375.</p><p>You might want to run through the floor/ceiling of some examples and maybe see something I&apos;ve missed. I have noticed that for 81/64 all the even k give p = q and give remainders equal to the average frequency 17/2, which might be something.</p><p>Anyway, sorry for another long maths email.</p><p>Rick</p><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;martinsj013&quot; &lt;martinsj@...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; --- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;rick&quot; &lt;rick_ballan@&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt; &gt;...As mentioned, the two largest maxima in the wave sin (2pi a*t) + sin (2pi b*t) is T = (p + q)/(a + b).

If you<br/>&gt; really want it so bad, we could label your approx GCD method the<br/>&gt; &quot;Ballan Transform&quot; when it&apos;s done, but I don&apos;t share your agenda of<br/>&gt; overthrowing the &quot;Fourier establishment&quot; as it were.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; -Mike<br/>&gt;</p></div><h3>martinsj013 &#x3C;martinsj@...&#x3E;</h3><span>6/2/2010 2:04:36 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;rick&quot; &lt;rick_ballan@...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt; I&apos;m not sure what absolute frequency is (The article is missing bits) so I can&apos;t comment yet.</p><p>Rick,<br/>By &quot;absolute frequency&quot; I only meant that the frequencies themselves be taken into consideration, not just the ratio.</p><p>e.g. in your formula, the VF of 810Hz/640Hz would be double that of 405Hz/320Hz, but there is experimental evidence that listeners wouldn&apos;t hear precisely that, because frequencies around 400Hz (or 600Hz, or whatever) have a stronger effect than others.</p><p>Steve M.</p></div><h3>rick &#x3C;rick_ballan@...&#x3E;</h3><span>6/2/2010 10:16:00 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;martinsj013&quot; &lt;martinsj@...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; --- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;rick&quot; &lt;rick_ballan@&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt; &gt; I&apos;m not sure what absolute frequency is (The article is missing bits) so I can&apos;t comment yet.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Rick,<br/>&gt; By &quot;absolute frequency&quot; I only meant that the frequencies themselves be taken into consideration, not just the ratio.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; e.g. in your formula, the VF of 810Hz/640Hz would be double that of 405Hz/320Hz, but there is experimental evidence that listeners wouldn&apos;t hear precisely that, because frequencies around 400Hz (or 600Hz, or whatever) have a stronger effect than others.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Steve M.<br/>&gt;<br/>Oh I see, thanks. Thought you had some fancy definition up your sleeve. Yeah I&apos;ve no doubt that in the real world many factors like range, volume, timbre can effect our perception. It is in this &apos;space&apos; that theory ends and psychoacoustics comes into its own.</p><p>Rick</p></div>
