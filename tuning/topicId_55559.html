That&apos;s why there is an undergraduate subject called<br/>analytic geometry, which actually uses algebra, not analysis. Then<br/>there is geometric algbebra, which does all of the stuff about wedge<br/>products, etc in a way which seems useful to physicists, but not very<br/>much to us. Then there is a dark and sinister subject called algbraic<br/>geometry, which is just analytic geometry after it has grown shark&apos;s<br/>teeth and adopted some very technical and high-powered concepts.<br/>Objects such as lattices can be seen in algebraic terms or even in<br/>graph-theory terms.<br/>And so forth...</p></div>
