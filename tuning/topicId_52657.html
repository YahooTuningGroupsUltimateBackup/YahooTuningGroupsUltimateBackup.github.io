If you issue a pitch bend for a given channel, anything<br/>played on it will have that tuning. It&apos;s easy to run out of available<br/>channels if you also have a lot of midi instruments in play, because<br/>they work just like pitch bend--you tell a channel to play a<br/>particular midi instrument, and until you change that, that is what<br/>it does.
