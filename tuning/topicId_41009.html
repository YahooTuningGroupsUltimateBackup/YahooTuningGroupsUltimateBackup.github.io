It was a conveniently available file I did<br/>a couple of years ago that I had lying around, and it happened to have a<br/>texture similar to what I wanted to use. I soon realized that if I tempered<br/>out the 128/125, it would actually be a fairly good tuning for this piece.<br/>Since 15-ET is a kleismic (15625/15552) temperament that is also an<br/>augmented (128/125) temperament, it was a natural choice, and the third<br/>movement ended up sounding really nice with very few manual changes.</p><p>So then I tried the first and second movements. They required more manual<br/>adjustments, and I was never completely satisfied with the way the second<br/>movement came out, but the first movement has some really beautiful parts.<br/>In fact, I realized that without even trying, Beethoven wrote music that<br/>sounds better in 15-ET than anything I&apos;ll ever write. It even works well in<br/>other porcupine temperaments (250/243) like 22-ET and 37-ET, if you extend<br/>the scale to more than 15 notes. The syntonic comma is hardly a problem at<br/>all in the first and third movements, so it&apos;s possible there might be other<br/>tunings that would work. Part of the reason the porcupine temperament works<br/>so well, though, is the 64/63 comma (which is shared by 12-ET). The seventh<br/>of the dominant seventh chord actually sounds like a harmonic seventh. The<br/>128/125 was sort of a red herring (since the 22 and 37-ET versions work<br/>just fine without it), but at least it led me to 15-ET!</p><p>The third movement is done with a hammered dulcimer patch, which is what I<br/>was planning to use for the kleismic piece I was thinking about writing.<br/>Since the first movement is slower, I tried a number of different patches<br/>with long sustains and settled on a nice vibraphone. The second movement<br/>seemed to be a little less objectionable with steel drums, but those commas<br/>really stick out in 15-ET.</p><p>--<br/>see my music page ---&gt;   ---&lt;<a href="http://www.io.com/~hmiller/music/index.html">http://www.io.com/~hmiller/music/index.html</a>&gt;--<br/>hmiller (Herman Miller)   &quot;If all Printers were determin&apos;d not to print any<br/><a href="https://twitter.com/io">@io</a>.com  email password: thing till they were sure it would offend no body,<br/>\ &quot;Subject: teamouse&quot; /  there would be very little printed.&quot; -Ben Franklin</p></div><h3><a id=41013 href="#41013">ðŸ”—</a>Gene Ward Smith &#x3C;genewardsmith@juno.com&#x3E;</h3><span>11/20/2002 1:26:12 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In tuning@y..., Herman Miller &lt;hmiller@I...&gt; wrote:</p><p>&gt; Yes, this is Beethoven&apos;s Moonlight Sonata, retuned to 15 notes per octave.</p><p>Thanks for the addition to your <a href="http://mp3.com">mp3.com</a> page!
