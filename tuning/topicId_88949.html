Out of those, my &quot;modified Ptolemic &apos;Infinity&apos; &quot; scale uses 11/8, 7/4 and 11/6 as interval gaps.</p><p>  Oddly enough these include most of the intervals I find as consonant.  The other ones I find consonant not on your list include:<br/>    11/9 (1.2222)...true this sounds a bit more tense than 6/5 or 5/4...but not hugely so unlike, say, 17/14 or 21/17.<br/>    12/11 to 10/9 (they sound about the same and intervals in-between them actually sound fine to me...though 10/9 sounds a bit different than the rest it&apos;s not dramatic)<br/>    22/15 (this is an alternative to the usual 3/2 fifth with a slightly different, but not &quot;wolfish&quot; sound)</p><p>So do the rest of you have any intervals to add to (or debate as valid or invalid from) either<br/>A) The &quot;decently concordant interval&quot; list John has made or<br/>B) The &quot;decently concordant and significantly different from 12TET&quot; interval list I have made?</p><p>-Michael</p></div><h3>genewardsmith &#x3C;genewardsmith@...&#x3E;</h3><span>5/8/2010 6:08:17 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;john777music&quot; &lt;jfos777@...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I used my Interval Calculator to work out all possible &quot;good&quot; (in harmony) intervals over a one octave range.

Of these, 12/11, 10/9, 14/11, 16/11, 14/9, 16/9 are in effect present, as octave compliments (making them impossible to avoid.) Adding them in makes the interval list into the 11-limit diamond, minus 11/10, 20/11, 11/9, and 18/11 plus a lone 13-limit interval, 13/7.</p><p>If we allow 11/5 into consideration you&apos;d want to add that to the list, so really all you&apos;d end up doing would be to toss neutral thirds, and add a lonely 13/7. Why not just use the 11-limit diamond instead?</p></div>
