In the C dominant seventh chord &quot;acoustically&quot; tuned, the Bb is closer to<br/>&gt;&gt;the E below--a diminished fifth.</p><p>And inserted an attempt (lame as it is) at humor.</p><p>&gt;&gt;What&apos;s that you say? Common practice is not the only music system in<br/>&gt;&gt;existence? Well, I&apos;ll be hornswaggled! You mean some composers could care<br/>&gt;&gt;less about acoustic reality and four hundred years of practice? I&apos;ll be<br/>&gt;&gt;damned.</p><p>Paul Erlich, ever ready to rescue from the pits of error, galloped into the<br/>room and with one mighty swath of his blade announced that...</p><p>&gt; Your &quot;four hundred years of music practice&quot; is a myth.</p><p>Now, the main point of my &quot;humorous&quot; paragraph had to do with acoustic<br/>reality and the &quot;four hundred years of practice&quot; was included to give it a<br/>kind of &quot;ka-bum.&quot;</p><p>The valuable substance of Paul&apos;s contribution quickly follows, however, and<br/>points out some historical practices which he believes scuttles any<br/>possibility that persons practicing music during the four hundred years in<br/>question had ears.</p><p>&gt; In the meantone era,<br/>&gt; roughly 1480-1780, diminished fifths were tuned closer to 7:10 and augmented<br/>&gt; fourths were tuned closer to 5:7, making dominant seventh chords very<br/>&gt; dissonant by modern standards. But these dissonant dominant sevenths are<br/>&gt; highly appropriate for the music of that period.</p><p>Meantone tuning was an inadequate &quot;stopgap&quot; temperament used to tune<br/>_keyboard instruments. Why would string players and singers from any era<br/>settle for such ugliness when just a slight wiggle of a finger or vocal<br/>chord produced stunning loveliness? Those &quot;dissonant dominant sevenths&quot; are<br/>only appropriate for the _keyboards_ of that period--not for strings and<br/>voices.</p><p>Elsewhere and earlier, you commented that singers today who intend to<br/>perform this period music in a stylistically correct manner emulate this<br/>sort of compromise tuning. This makes no sense to me, so I choose not to<br/>believe that pitch-sensitive singers in the periods in question would have<br/>done so. Perhaps when they sang with meantone-tuned organs, they had little<br/>choice. But certainly not when singing a cappella.</p><p>To be sure, many of today&apos;s singers emulate equal-tempered keyboard tuning,<br/>largely because they &quot;learn their notes&quot; by means of a piano and also<br/>because music educators have failed to let them know there is a better way.<br/>In spite of this, many talented singers (and most string players)<br/>intuitively escape this nonsense and tune their pitches to each other<br/>instead of to a keyboard standard.</p><p>Now, to diminished fifths, etc. The 5:7 interval appears in a non-functional<br/>manner in many ethnic traditions--most prominently in Indian vocal lines and<br/>in Georgian choral music. This interval invariably occurs between pitches<br/>corresponding to the fifth and seventh partials of a sustained root. It only<br/>makes sense that when functional harmony emerged in Europe, those human ears<br/>(given the chance) would gravitate to that same simple combination of<br/>pitches when the dominant chord is sounding. Can I prove it. Probably not.<br/>Do I believe it? Absolutely. (At least until someone provides reasonable<br/>evidence to the contrary.) Has anyone been to the seventeenth century<br/>lately?</p><p>*****</p><p>Later in that discussion, I speculated:</p><p>&gt;&gt;It might be<br/>&gt;&gt;considered that during Fokker&apos;s productive years, the principle of tonality<br/>&gt;&gt;was being seriously challenged by Schoenberg and friends. It seems likely<br/>&gt;&gt;that his use of these interval terms were intentionally &quot;nonfunctional.&quot;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; On the contrary, Fokker kept all the features of meantone tuning intact, and<br/>&gt; remember, meantone is the tuning in which functional harmony was born.</p><p>It is no coincidence, I think, that the violin and functional harmony<br/>emerged at roughly the same time. String players and the composers who wrote<br/>for them must have delighted in the kaleidoscopic chromatic freedom provided<br/>by these instruments--the dynamic well-tuned &quot;tritone&quot; flinging the tonality<br/>in every conceivable direction. The ultra chromatic music written during the<br/>Baroque period (particularly slow movements) argues _very loudly_ that the<br/>players were enjoying true diminished fifths and augmented fourths and<br/>clearly hearing the difference.</p><p>Why would Fokker--indeed, why would anyone--avoid such musical excitement in<br/>favor of compromise? The answer, it would seem, is to accommodate<br/>fixed-pitch instruments. In that sense, Fokker&apos;s interval names can be seen<br/>as &quot;non functional&quot; in that they fail to reflect the &quot;common practice&quot; that<br/>likely arose as a result of flexible tuning and Fokker, like others before<br/>him, appears to encase &quot;common practice&quot; in the coffin of keyboard<br/>limitations.</p><p>I gotta get some sleep. Thanks again, Paul, for getting my juices going.</p><p>Respectfully,</p><p>Jerry</p></div><h3><a id=8483 href="#8483">ðŸ”—</a>Daniel Wolf &#x3C;djwolf@snafu.de&#x3E;</h3><span>2/11/2000 11:55:03 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>From: Gerald Eskelin &gt;</p><p>&gt; Meantone tuning was an inadequate &quot;stopgap&quot; temperament used to tune<br/>&gt; _keyboard instruments.
