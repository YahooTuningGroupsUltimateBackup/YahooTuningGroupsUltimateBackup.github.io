A<br/>system where even the Pythagorean pentatonics is out of tune, or the error has<br/>passed on to another degree, caused all forms of beating problems that I found<br/>made it impossible to investigate the simplest of tuning structures.

And I agree that MIDI can never fully replace<br/>acoustic instrumentation, but not for the reason you gave.<br/>The reasons I know of are beyond the scope of this forum.<br/>But a musician may practice on a particular MIDI instrument<br/>for many years and learn to make very good music with it.<br/>And, as with anything that makes a more-or-less controllable<br/>sound of any kind, a MIDI controller/player combination can<br/>be used as a musical instrument in its own right, different<br/>from any acoustic instrument.  Good thing, since they&apos;re a<br/>lot easier to tune, in principle, at least.</p><p>David J.
