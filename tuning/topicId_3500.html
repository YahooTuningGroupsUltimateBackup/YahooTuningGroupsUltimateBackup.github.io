I had a concert last weekend and got behind<br/>on everything including a marathon of posts here - it has taken me this long to catch<br/>up...many interesting threads are being woven here.  BTW, a lot of it is way over my head<br/>but I am a fascinated and eager-to-learn newbie here.</p><p>[Ray Tomes]</p><p>&gt; I have found this discussion very interesting.  Dave, it seems to me<br/>&gt; that if the undertones are appearing by a slight vocal adjustment then<br/>&gt; it makes a lot of sense to see them as undertones and not some<br/>&gt; arrangement of different overtones with a varying fundamental.<br/>&gt; The whole original description shouts &quot;undertones&quot; at me.</p><p>Yes Ray - I guess it&apos;s these slight adjustments, the dramatic and instantaneous &quot;kicking<br/>in&quot; of the lower notes at fixed intervals below, and the fact that (for ex.) the original<br/>fund., the octave below, and the octave and fifth below can sound at once (I&apos;ve been<br/>listening very carefully in spare moments this past week and am convinced they are all<br/>there - at least sometimes), that make it shout undertones to me too.</p><p>&gt; [Ray]<br/>&gt; I agree that the physics of multiple undertones is not so obvious.<br/>&gt; However in this case we have a sentient being deliberately shaping<br/>&gt; resonant cavities to achieve the effects.  This means that if some small<br/>&gt; non-linearities are present then a close approximation to cavity shape<br/>&gt; required to produce exact undertones could cause some locking in.<br/>&gt;</p><p>Dave Hill&apos;s 5/28 posting seemed to hint at this idea near the end (&quot;...given the physics<br/>of standing waves in cavities such as horns, it seems plausible that there should be faint<br/>vibrations at one half or possibly another submultiple of the fundamental frequency.&quot;</p><p>&gt;<br/>&gt; Paul Erlich [TD199.4]<br/>&gt; &gt;I think a better description would relate to chaos theory. The opening and closing of<br/>&gt; &gt;the vocal folds experiences a period-doubling, so the apparent fundamental and its<br/>&gt; &gt;overtones are still prominent (due to the dynamics and not the filtering) but the<br/>&gt; &gt;true fundamental is an octave lower. The way the &quot;subharmonic&quot; almost &quot;jumps&quot; in and<br/>&gt; out of existence as one varies the mode of singing is a hallmark of a nonlinear<br/>&gt; &gt;bifurcation. I refer Jim to any of the popular books on chaos theory, such as Manfred<br/>&gt; &gt;Schroeder&apos;s _Fractals, Chaos, and Power Laws_.<br/>&gt;</p><p>Thanks Paul - I look forward to reading this as well as the others you referred to<br/>before.  This is an area I know next to nothing about (except &quot;chaos&quot; - in daily life!)</p><p>&gt; [Ray]<br/>&gt; I disagree as it is stated that notes 1/2, 1/3, 1/4, 1/5 the original<br/>&gt; all came in with slight adjustments.  That is not chaotic behaviour but<br/>&gt; undertones.</p><p>I would like to make a recording of this phenomenon and send it to whomever on this list<br/>is interested in listening to it, analyzing, etc.  I guess cassette is the easiest for me<br/>to make.  I am really interested to get your feedback on these sounds - any takers?</p><p>~Jim Cole</p></div><h3>rtomes@xxxxx.xxx.xxxxxxxxxxxxx)</h3><span>6/16/1999 2:38:12 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Jim Cole [TD 214.1]</p><p>&gt;Whew - This is a hard list to keep up with!!!</p><p>I can echo that as I am responding so late to your message.</p><p>&gt;Yes Ray - I guess it&apos;s these slight adjustments, the dramatic and instantaneous &quot;kicking<br/>&gt;in&quot; of the lower notes at fixed intervals below, and the fact that (for ex.) the original<br/>&gt;fund., the octave below, and the octave and fifth below can sound at once (I&apos;ve been<br/>&gt;listening very carefully in spare moments this past week and am convinced they are all<br/>&gt;there - at least sometimes), that make it shout undertones to me too.</p><p>Right.

The book _Chaos<br/>and Fractals_ that I mentioned before actually gives a set of experimental<br/>results from a non-linear acoustical system where period doubling was<br/>observed (you can find hundreds of other such experiments discussed in the<br/>literature and even in abstracts on the internet).</p></div>
