They are the kind of issues that<br/>don&apos;t really have a resolution point, and all one can do is hope that<br/>an &quot;agree to disagree&quot; attitude will eventually take over. In the<br/>past, more often than not, this has happened. Whether it happened<br/>quite quickly enough is usually when people start wondering about<br/>moderation.</p><p>The list has survived this long, and people still seem to come and<br/>participate and get something out of it. There really doesn&apos;t seem to<br/>be any deeply compelling reason to install some form of external<br/>moderation (as opposed to people just moderating their own behavior)<br/>at this point, any more than at any other point.</p><p>Geez, even Gene and I found a way to get along after a while. What<br/>could be worse than *that* spat? ;)</p><p>Cheers,<br/>Jon</p></div>
