He especially plays the one in d minor really amazing.<br/>This has been one of my favorite recordings for years. I also have<br/>Woodwards complete on LP but Id rather hear Shostakovich playing them any<br/>day. Havn&apos;t heard Jarrets but the one classical recording of his I heard (I<br/>think Bach) sounded like a jazz pianinst playing classical without the<br/>techniqual control one expects from a classical musician. For all the<br/>limitations of classical music training (and as a grad. and now teacher at<br/>Juilliard I know whereof I speak) it does give one amazing technical<br/>control of ones instrument, and this is audible in performance. It is<br/>particularly when you hear someone like Jarret without classical training<br/>playing classical repetoire that you hear the difference. Interpretaion is<br/>another story. There are scads of classical pianists out there that can<br/>play the shit out of the instrument that have no personality in their<br/>playing, and couldnt improvise their way out of a paper bag if their life<br/>depended on it. The ideal is combining the rigour of classical training<br/>with improvisational skills to impart more spontenaity to interpretations.</p><p>dante</p></div><h3><a id=822 href="#822">ðŸ”—</a>Kraig Grady &#x3C;kraiggrady@xxxxxxxxx.xxxx&#x3E;</h3><span>2/14/1999 1:58:48 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>dante rosati wrote:</p><p>&gt; From: dante rosati &lt;<a href="mailto:dante@pop.interport.net">dante@pop.interport.net</a>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;From: Kraig Grady &lt;<a href="mailto:kraiggrady@anaphoria.com">kraiggrady@anaphoria.com</a>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;There are some recordings finally of Dimitri playing himself that has been out<br/>&gt; &gt;in russia for ever.
