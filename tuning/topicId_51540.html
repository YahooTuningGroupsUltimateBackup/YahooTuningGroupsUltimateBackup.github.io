For example, you can rotate<br/>&gt;a 4-D cube so it looks like the shadow of 3-D cube in 2-D.</p><p>[Paul]<br/>&gt;Right.</p><p>[me]<br/>&gt;^1 Wilson called the 6-factor stuff with the 1 in the center of the<br/>&gt;pentagon, &quot;cheating&quot;.  If you look at the Pascal&apos;s triangle of CPSs,<br/>&gt;he uses the same projection for the x)5 CPSs as the x)6 ones.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;^2 The centered-pentagon stuff shares the 5-fold symmetry of the<br/>&gt;triakontahedron mapping and the Penrose tilings, which can all be<br/>&gt;projected, I believe I&apos;ve read, from polytopes of no higher dimension<br/>&gt;than five.</p><p>[Paul]<br/>&gt;Unless you use the &quot;shadow&quot; trick you mentioned above!</p><p>[Dave]<br/>&gt;Good detective work re Dekany = Rectified Pentachoron.
