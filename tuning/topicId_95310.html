(<br/><a href="http://webchat.freenode.net/">http://webchat.freenode.net/</a>)</p><p> secondly, may I introduce what I&apos;m doing?     I am currently developing<br/>iPhone applications to teach musical fluency.   my motivation is that I am<br/>striving for this fluency myself.</p><p> so far I have released one app:<br/><a href="http://itunes.apple.com/gb/app/chordwheel-pro/id406836326?mt=8">http://itunes.apple.com/gb/app/chordwheel-pro/id406836326?mt=8</a></p><p> and my second is going to be a perfect pitch training game,  but this has<br/>led me into deep and new waters; ie  looking at tuning systems notably just<br/>intonation,  and going backwards even further looking at pure ratios,  and<br/>the fundamental  mathematical nature of music.</p><p> Already I have a problem.   I have got it working by positioning the 12<br/> equal ratio semitone pitch classes at the 12 points of a clock face, and<br/>have a needle point  in the direction currently being sung.    but this is<br/>really unsuitable. I have no desire to sing in this tuning system. It sounds<br/>all wrong to me.   it is not natural for my voice.   I need to represent<br/>these tones using ratios. Fair enough, I can use just intonation.   but now<br/>I have a problem.  let&apos;s say the tone at 12 o&apos;clock  is always the keynote,<br/>and the remaining 11 get positioned using just intonation.    The attached<br/>picture gives an idea of this.   but what if I want to change key?   let&apos;s<br/>say I modulate from C to D.   if I simply use the previous &apos;D&apos;,  and<br/>recalculate everything around that,  that is surely the best option.

The best-known example is from the diatonic scale: if you go up a fourth to F, down a minor third to D, up a fourth to G, and then down to C, you won&apos;t get back to the C you started at if all the intervals are just. In fact, you&apos;ll get to (4/3)*(5/6)*(4/3)*(2/3) = 80/81. The small interval of 80/81 is known as the syntonic comma, or comma of Didymus. One solution to this is to temper: you can flatten the fifth somewhat--ideally more than the two cents it is flattened in 12 equal--and make the tone from C to D the same size as the one from D to E. If you make the third from C to E a just 5/4, then C up a ninth to D&apos; can be divided in two to get a flattened G. This is called 1/4 comma meantone tuning, and is very close to what you get by dividing the octave into 31 equal parts. This and related systems were in general use for hundreds of years.</p></div><h3><a id=95313 href="#95313">ðŸ”—</a>cityoftheasleep &#x3C;igliashon@...&#x3E;</h3><span>1/1/2011 1:10:29 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, Pi &lt;sunfish7@...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;  and my second is going to be a perfect pitch training game,  but this has<br/>&gt; led me into deep and new waters; ie  looking at tuning systems notably just<br/>&gt; intonation,  and going backwards even further looking at pure ratios,  and<br/>&gt; the fundamental  mathematical nature of music.</p><p>There is no &quot;fundamental mathematical nature of music&quot;.  Or rather, there is no &quot;one&quot; fundamental mathematical nature of music, but a plethora of equally-valid ones.  Many succumb to the siren-song of thinking it&apos;s &quot;all about ratios and prime numbers&quot; because of its rational simplicity and historical popularity, and indeed much great music has resulted from this approach.  But a brief examination of the irregularities inherent in human hearing (as well as the irregularities of musical instruments and other sound-producing devices), it becomes quite obvious and clear that neither do our ears nor sounds themselves obey the strict regularity of JI frequency ratios.  Where the relevance of ratios begins (and ends) is in their use of the construction of abstract musical systems and structures, which can then be only imperfectly realized in practice (except, perhaps in the realm of synthesis, but even that is questionable).  The same can be said for all other mathematical characterizations of musical intervals--especially including temperaments.</p><p>Music, as a physical and/or psychological phenomenon, deals only with probabilities.  The best that can be said of any exact frequency relationship is that it might describe an *actual* relationship between sound frequencies for a statistically-significant portion of the time.  All this means, of course, is that we (as musicians) have absolute freedom to choose (or ignore) any of the multitudes of mathematically-described musical systems, according to our personal preferences; we can all rest assured that there is no one &quot;right, pure, true, and fundamental way to tune&quot;.</p><p>&gt;  Already I have a problem.

Personally, I prefer the first option, as I find neither psychological nor aesthetic advantage in dealing with integer ratios, but many others DO find advantage in dealing with ratios, so your mileage may vary.</p><p>-Igliashon Jones</p><p>P.S.

I can see that it is also a problem<br/>for notation.   but is it actually a musical problem?  if we are singing<br/>barbershop,  or playing violins and trombones, maybe no correction is<br/>needed?</p><p> So going C -&gt; G -&gt; D -&gt; F -&gt; C</p><p> maybe musically we have the option of returning back to the established<br/>tonal centre (the original C),  or  shifting tonal centre.    while our new<br/>note is at a ratio of 81/80  to the original C,  it has a more comfortable<br/>ratio with G,D,F that were passed  through in order to arrive at it.</p><p> it may be that devices such as the iPad with touchscreen capability could<br/>become the first instruments to allow dynamic recreation of related tones,<br/>ie  it is conceivable that whatever note you hit, the entire screen<br/>rearranges around that point showing you your  current closest matches,  and<br/>maybe highlighting the recent path you have taken to get to the<br/>now. although really polyphony is the only thing that touchscreen would have<br/>over conventional computer interface...  Has anyone experimented with this?</p><p>I am still struggling with a lot of concepts</p><p> one thing I notice is that starting with a frequency which I represent by 1</p><p> I construct an octave, which I can write as 1/2</p><p> splits up into 2/3 and 3/4  (2/3 x 3/4 = 1/2)  ie P5 + P4</p><p> each of these we can split up</p><p> look at 4/5 x 5/6 = 2/3 ie M3 + m3</p><p> now the terminology seems to break down,  for example - there is no term<br/>for the next interval that I know of.  but we can still keep splitting ad<br/>infinitum</p><p>6/7 x 7/8 = 3/4</p><p>etc.</p><p>8/9 x 9/10 = 4/5 ...<br/>etc etc</p><p> now what of these smaller intervals?   I have never heard any mention of<br/>any musical system or research that examines these intervals.</p><p> another phenomenon I notice is the spectral composition of chords:   I<br/>linked to a post I made on this subject,  giving an example of playing a C4<br/>simultaneously with G4,  and how this implies a  fundamental frequency at<br/>C3,  with a rich pattern repeating through its harmonics</p><p><a href="http://wehearandplay.com/forum/viewtopic.php?p=4994#4994">http://wehearandplay.com/forum/viewtopic.php?p=4994#4994</a></p><p> I can see this readily extending to any chord or progression,  in a fractal<br/>like way,  so that  maybe an entire piece of music could be considered to be<br/>dancing through the harmonics of its root  tone.    also it should be<br/>possible to suggest fundamentals well below the range of human hearing;  I<br/>wonder if the incredibly complex harmonies of Rachmaninov are doing this,<br/> and that this music is inaccessible to many people;  maybe it requires<br/> substantial familiarity to train the brain to be able to recreate such<br/>fundamentals.   a friend was pointing out to me how our brains are naturally<br/>tuned to recreating a complete picture given just a small sample of data,<br/>how a handful of brush strokes can imply a gondolier or a tiger.   so it<br/>seems to me that music is dancing around some underlying harmony, and our<br/>voices minds eyes and instruments can somehow resonate with this dance,<br/>evoke this dance...  yet somehow the dance is beyond the representation.</p><p> Sorry, that is a real meander...</p><p> the next thing I am wondering is about the wisdom of my initial design,<br/> which was to work modulo the octave; ie C4  and C5 would both shoot the<br/>needle to the 12 o&apos;clock position.   now I haven&apos;t quite got my head around<br/>this, but it seems as though there is nothing unique in the concept of<br/>octave.

There are also different &quot;puns&quot; that<br/>you can make in other tunings as well, all of which have their own<br/>flavor; blackwood[10] has become a favorite of mine. It&apos;s two chains<br/>of 5-et a major third apart, so that modulation by five fifths brings<br/>you back to where you started (as opposed to 12 fifths like we&apos;re used<br/>to).</p><p>&gt; &nbsp;maybe musically we have the option of returning back to the established tonal centre (the original C), &nbsp;or &nbsp;shifting tonal centre. &nbsp; &nbsp;while our new note is at a ratio of 81/80 &nbsp;to the original C, &nbsp;it has a more comfortable ratio with G,D,F that were passed &nbsp;through in order to arrive at it.</p><p>Yes, but if you temper the root movements, you may never notice, while<br/>still having perfectly just chords. Or you could explore modulation by<br/>81/80 for its own musical effect, which can be quite beautiful. For<br/>example, in 5-limit JI, the following chord progression modulates up<br/>by 81/80 each time:</p><p>||: Cmaj9 | Dmaj9 | Dm9 :||</p><p>Voice it and arpeggiate like this: ||: C-E-G-B-D | D-F#-A-C#-E | D-F-A-C-E :||</p><p>But squeeze it into one octave, so that the B-D is movement down by a<br/>major sixth rather than up by a minor third. It drifts every time, but<br/>I think it&apos;s beautiful.</p><p>&gt; &nbsp;it may be that devices such as the iPad with touchscreen capability could become the first instruments to allow dynamic recreation of related tones, ie &nbsp;it is conceivable that whatever note you hit, the entire screen rearranges around that point showing you your &nbsp;current closest matches, &nbsp;and maybe highlighting the recent path you have taken to get to the now.&nbsp;although really polyphony is the only thing that touchscreen would have over conventional computer interface... &nbsp;Has anyone experimented with this?</p><p>I don&apos;t think that something like this currently exists. In general,<br/>this community is starving for new tools to write music with, so feel<br/>free to make it happen.</p><p>&gt; &nbsp;now the terminology seems to break down, &nbsp;for example - there is no term for the next interval that I know of. &nbsp;but we can still keep splitting ad infinitum<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; 6/7 x 7/8 = 3/4</p><p>7/6 is often called a &quot;subminor third,&quot; and 8/7 is often called a<br/>&quot;supermajor second.&quot; I&apos;ve seen some people abbreviate them sm3 and<br/>SM2, but I prefer to make subminor just a lowercase &quot;s&quot; and supermajor<br/>an uppercase s: 7/6 = s3, 9/7 = S3, 8/7 = S2, etc.</p><p>&gt; 8/9 x 9/10 = 4/5 ...</p><p>9/8 is usually called a &quot;major whole tone,&quot; and 10/9 is usually called<br/>a &quot;minor whole tone.&quot; I have never liked these names because they&apos;re<br/>both used in both the major and minor 5-limit scales, but that&apos;s the<br/>name for them that I know.</p><p>&gt; etc etc<br/>&gt; &nbsp;now what of these smaller intervals? &nbsp; I have never heard any mention of any musical system or research that examines these intervals.</p><p>That would be because most of the research involving microtonal<br/>intervals like this has taken place outside of academia. A lot of it<br/>has taken place on this mailing list. You should read Carl Lumma&apos;s<br/>&quot;too condensed tuning-math outline,&quot; it&apos;s a great introduction to all<br/>of this stuff: <a href="http://www.lumma.org/music/theory/tctmo/">http://www.lumma.org/music/theory/tctmo/</a></p><p>Paul Erlich&apos;s &quot;A Middle Path&quot; is also a great paper to read to get<br/>started: <a href="http://eceserv0.ece.wisc.edu/~sethares/paperspdf/Erlich-MiddlePath.pdf">eceserv0.ece.wisc.edu/~sethares/paperspdf/Erlich-MiddlePath.pdf</a></p><p>&gt; &nbsp;another phenomenon I notice is the spectral composition of chords: &nbsp; I linked to a post I made on this subject, &nbsp;giving an example of playing a C4 simultaneously with G4, &nbsp;and how this implies a &nbsp;fundamental frequency at C3, &nbsp;with a rich pattern repeating through its harmonics<br/>&gt; <a href="http://wehearandplay.com/forum/viewtopic.php?p=4994#4994">http://wehearandplay.com/forum/viewtopic.php?p=4994#4994</a><br/>&gt; &nbsp;I can see this readily extending to any chord or progression, &nbsp;in a fractal like way, &nbsp;so that &nbsp;maybe an entire piece of music could be considered to be dancing through the harmonics of its root &nbsp;tone.</p><p>I think that this is part of it, but that part of music is also the<br/>jumping around of root tones, as well as causing an ambiguity between<br/>which tone really is the &quot;root&quot; for a certain interval.</p><p>&gt; &nbsp;&nbsp;there must be some research into laying out these tones in some way that illustrates the musical connection between them. &nbsp; &nbsp;for example, all 2^k * note_i &nbsp;are somehow in the same octaves-category, pitchclass_2. &nbsp; &nbsp;all 3^k &nbsp;notes are in the same pitchclass_3 &nbsp;category. &nbsp; &nbsp;these categories can combine, &nbsp;just the same way prime numbers can combine to give integers.</p><p>If there&apos;s one thing that there&apos;s a hell of a lot of research on, it&apos;s<br/>that. Start here: <a href="http://xenharmonic.wikispaces.com/">http://xenharmonic.wikispaces.com/</a></p><p>&gt; &nbsp;I would have thought that if you start with a tone, &nbsp;and Mark around at all of the low ratios, so that you have a visual indication, &nbsp;may be the distance represents the actual distance in pitch, &nbsp;and the angle represents the composition of primes. &nbsp; and you just start filling &nbsp;it in with the lower numbers..... &nbsp;what sort of mathematical shape would give a decent representation? Maybe each constituent prime would come with its own colour, &nbsp;so you could at a glance get some measure...</p><p>I&apos;ve often thought about representations such as these. There are a<br/>lot of good ones but I haven&apos;t gotten too far into them... yet. Feel<br/>free to come up with your own diagrams and post them here.</p><p>&gt; &nbsp;I am very very curious about this: looking at it as a completely abstract problem, how can we represent on paper what we perceive as beautiful music? &nbsp; &nbsp;does it really all disappear down the rabbit hole?</p><p>No, but I think that there&apos;s more to it than math. You spoke earlier<br/>about understanding music in terms of mathematics; what you should be<br/>thinking more about is understanding music in terms of<br/>psychoacoustics. There are real limits to our perception of different<br/>integer ratios - 501/400, for example, is probably going to be heard<br/>as 5/4, even though technically it&apos;s not. These limits can be used to<br/>create their own musical effects. Look up &quot;harmonic entropy&quot; for more<br/>research on this.</p><p>On top of the psychoacoustic layer is the cognitive layer, where<br/>things like cultural factors and learned scale patterns and personal<br/>preferences come into it. How much of the perception of music is<br/>psychoacoustic and how much is cognitive is an open question. There<br/>are lots of opinions on it.</p><p>-Mike</p></div><h3><a id=95770 href="#95770">ðŸ”—</a>gregggibson &#x3C;gregggibson@...&#x3E;</h3><span>1/22/2011 8:19:52 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>&gt;<br/>&gt;  Already I have a problem.

For instance, there&apos;s the scale you get by dividing the ~4/3 in half, which incidentally tempers out 49/48 (the difference between two 7/6&apos;s and a 4/3) and makes a nice 9-note MOS scale of 3 3 1 3 1 3 1 3 1 and has 7 consonant triads with two sizes of 3rd each, or the scale you get by dividing the major 3rd into 3 parts, giving 2 2 2 2 3 2 2 2 2, or the scale you get by dividing the 5/3 in half, giving 2 2 3 2 2 3 2 3, or the f&apos;ed-up 7-note version of the whole-tone scale it does, 3 3 3 3 3 3 1.  19 does some cool 13-limit stuff pretty decently, like 13/7, 13/9, and 13/10, and it&apos;s the smallest EDO that approximates harmonics 1-31 within at least 30 cents.  It&apos;s not great in the 7-limit but it at least gets in the ball-park.  It fascinates me how, unlike in 12-EDO, the 5-limit and 7-limit are separated out in 19, but the 11- and 13-limit are wrapped up with both the 5- and 7-limit harmonies (particularly how 8/5 and 13/8 are approximated by the same interval of about 821 cents, and also that 7/5=11/8=18/13)...yet if you use the right harmonic configurations, you can totally distinguish the different prime identities.

Whether or not you can<br/>construct an irrational version that still sounds pleasant, due to<br/>some property of the buzz that I haven&apos;t mapped out yet, is an<br/>interesting question. There are a few interesting observations here,<br/>to reiterate</p><p>1) There&apos;s probably a critical threshold for the drat at which the<br/>whole thing stops being heard as &quot;synced up&quot; at all. I doubt we hear a<br/>301/200 polyrhythm as anything but a rushing 3/2 polyrhythm. We need<br/>to review the literature on the perception of rhythm to formalize this<br/>more precisely.<br/>2) It may not be the end of the world if the brat and the drat aren&apos;t<br/>perfectly in sync, or if there are two rhythms going on in parallel,<br/>so long as they don&apos;t conflict with one another in such a way that is<br/>irritating. The literature on the perception of rhythm would also be a<br/>good place to look, but I don&apos;t have much time now.<br/>3) If you end up with lots of partials that are in the red zone of<br/>awful beating, it sounds awful.<br/>4) The volume of each harmonic gets lower as the harmonic gets higher,<br/>so it probably doesn&apos;t matter what&apos;s going on at partial 9 and 10 and<br/>what not.</p><p>&gt; &gt;&quot;I think what does matter is making sure that different important partials avoid the evil 70 cents critical band maximum of dissonance.&quot;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &nbsp; Funny, you say 70, Igs says 50, and I could swear it was more like 90 IE from -&gt; <a href="http://sethares.engr.wisc.edu/images/image3.gif">http://sethares.engr.wisc.edu/images/image3.gif</a>. &nbsp; Can anyone here give a definitive answer to where the maximum critical band dissonance point is?</p><p>I don&apos;t know.

However, the same unison vectors are tempered out anyway - if<br/>you look at the PB for one of these near-MOS scales, it looks like the<br/>normal PB but with a chunk taken out and pasted on the other side.

The last in particular is entirely without basis, and leads me to question your knowledge of musical acoustics.</p><p>I unfortunately do not have the time to reply to you in depth. This would require in part that I present some of my unpublished discoveries on this subject, especially concerning the binary theory of human hearing, symmetry and the differential limen, which I have found to be constant throughout the vocal register, and much narrower than in the literature. Also, this is of course not an appropriate forum to present such discoveries. Finally, your somewhat impolite and unscholarly tone gives me pause. I will however, in order to be helpful to others, respond to your first objection with a simple experiment that I like to use with subjects.</p><p>Ask a singer to sing three ascending major thirds, with the tone intercalated for greater ease in intonation. For example:</p><p>C D E     E F# G#     G# A# B#</p><p>You can, if you like, prompt the singer using whatever temperament you like, provided it has consonant major thirds in the chain of its fifths. It will make no difference in the results. I have used 12- 19- 26- 31- 43- 45- 50- and 55-tone equal for this purpose. I have also used 22- and 53-tone equal values, though these temperaments either exaggerate the comma (22-tone equal) or preserve it (53-tone equal) which results in highly dissonant fifths or thirds at some point in the tonal fabric. This of course is the reason for temperament in the first place, historically considered.</p><p>If the singer is singing just major thirds, the B# will fall short of the octave C by a diesis, about 1/5 tone; If 12-tone equal major thirds, B will equal C exactly; if Pythagorean major thirds, B will be sharper than C by a comma; finally, if the singer is using 19-tone equal major thirds, or what is audibly the same thing, major thirds diminished by 1/3 comma, B will be a diesis plus a comma flatter than C, or about 1/3 tone flatter. You can also ask them to complete the octave by singing C. Many singers are amazed that they always come out about 1/3 tone flat of C.</p><p>What happens? In virtually all cases, singers end about 1/3 tone flatter than C. When they do not, they are invariably wildly off by a tone or more, presumably they have not understood that they have been asked to sing major thirds. Musical training seems to make no difference.</p><p>This is very strong prima facie evidence that the human brain does indeed think in 19-tone equal, and in 1/3 tones, which are of course just narrower than the melodic limen of about 55-60 cents, as cited in the literature, and confirmed by my own experiments. This theory of the primacy of the 19-tone equal is not mine; there are two Italian professors who have presented evidence in favor of this, although I do not have their names to hand at the moment. I have however greatly extended and deepened this theory.</p><p>I have many interests and duties other than musical theory; I am just finishing my translation of Kafka&apos;s Stories at the moment, but will publish my musico-theoretical results in due course. Until then, I wish this board all the best.</p><p>Thanks to Carl Lumma for his kind words.

For starters, you&apos;ve got about a bazillion more MOS scales in 19, most of which involve very different structures and harmonic resources.  For instance, there&apos;s the scale you get by dividing the ~4/3 in half, which incidentally tempers out 49/48 (the difference between two 7/6&apos;s and a 4/3) and makes a nice 9-note MOS scale of 3 3 1 3 1 3 1 3 1 and has 7 consonant triads with two sizes of 3rd each, or the scale you get by dividing the major 3rd into 3 parts, giving 2 2 2 2 3 2 2 2 2, or the scale you get by dividing the 5/3 in half, giving 2 2 3 2 2 3 2 3, or the f&apos;ed-up 7-note version of the whole-tone scale it does, 3 3 3 3 3 3 1.  19 does some cool 13-limit stuff pretty decently, like 13/7, 13/9, and 13/10, and it&apos;s the smallest EDO that approximates harmonics 1-31 within at least 30 cents.  It&apos;s not great in the 7-limit but it at least gets in the ball-park.  It fascinates me how, unlike in 12-EDO, the 5-limit and 7-limit are separated out in 19, but the 11- and 13-limit are wrapped up with both the 5- and 7-limit harmonies (particularly how 8/5 and 13/8 are approximated by the same interval of about 821 cents, and also that 7/5=11/8=18/13)...yet if you use the right harmonic configurations, you can totally distinguish the different prime identities.  It&apos;s also not significantly worse than 22 in the 7-limit, despite what you might think, and to my ears actually sounds more &quot;septimal&quot; than 22 (even if less in-tune).<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Even the 5-limit diatonic sounds a whole lot different than 12-tET to my ears, much more of a departure than either the 31-EDO diatonic or the 17-EDO diatonic (probably because of the wide ~14/13 semitone).<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; There&apos;s lot&apos;s to like about 19 that has little to do with meantone and 12-tET.

Of course this is not to say that the thirteen dissonant intervals of the octave are of no importance.<br/>&gt;</p><p>I am replying to my own post, in order to clarify the above.</p><p>My reference to the senario and the thirteen dissonances is much too succinct and may create confusion; it may even appear to be an outright misstatement, including the octave with the dissonances.</p><p>Qua harmony, there are seven consonances within the octave inclusive, viz the senario and the octave itself. This leaves twelve dissonances.</p><p>Qua melody however, two of the seven consonances, the fourth and minor sixth, especially the former, have binary values (the binary code used by the deep brain to recognize intervals) which do not agree with their ratios. Hence the well-known difficulty of singers in learning the fourth, which despite its simple ratio 4:3 is actually little if at all easier to sing in melody than say, 25:18, which is a much more complex ratio, but that happens to almost exactly correspond with a binary-code equivalent.</p><p>Readers will have to excuse me for not elaborating upon this point, as my work regarding this is not yet published. I will however observe that the octave and its replicas form a binary sequence: 2 4 8 16 32 etc or 10 100 1000 10000 100000 etc and this is one of the simpler clues or elements in the development of a theory which can at last explain how the brain hears intervals. Obviously this is crucial to an understanding of tuning and temperament beyond say, the level of Mersenne, Huyghens or Sauveur.</p><p>It is of course highly necessary to insure that theory or speculation marches forward hand in hand with experimental results, or one will quickly find oneself in a morass of mere speculation, which however interesting, has no permanent value, except perhaps as a kind of quarry for future investigators.</p><p>Gregg Gibson</p></div><h3><a id=95912 href="#95912">ðŸ”—</a>straub@...</h3><span>1/28/2011 2:06:19 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;John Moriarty&quot; &lt;JlMoriart@...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I&apos;ve come to similar conclusions.
