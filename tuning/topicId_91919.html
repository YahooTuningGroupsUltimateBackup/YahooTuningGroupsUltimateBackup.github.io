This has<br/>more reasons and all of them are in narrow connection and feedback:</p><p>- Performers, singers and conductors still don&apos;t know too much about<br/>microtonality and its possibilities as a system. But I&apos;m sure some of<br/>them (not keyboard players with the exception of harpsichordists)<br/>have some knowledge about intonation and intentional work with it in<br/>real time during play, because they play in chamber groups or<br/>orchestras, or sing in a capella choirs where they must be aware of<br/>intonation. Then there are all those early music authentic movement<br/>performers, they know at least about historical tunings. But<br/>generally &quot;pure&quot; microtonal performing is not part of classical music<br/>study. It depends on personal interest and self study, or maybe<br/>somebody has good luck to meet a teacher for microtonality. If the<br/>performers for microtonal music are not available, of course such<br/>music can&apos;t be performed and there&apos;s no reason to compose it.<br/>But exactly this is a chance for all those types of creative<br/>musicians performing their own music, or who are good improvisers.</p><p>- Composers are limited by abilities of performers on acoustic<br/>instruments. They will not write microtonal compositions if there&apos;s<br/>no chance for their performing. But they can work with electronic<br/>instruments and computers without any borders concerning<br/>microtonality. Problem is in standard education where there&apos;s no<br/>place for microtonality in textbooks and official curriculum. All<br/>depends on personal interest from the side of student, and his/her<br/>self study, or again - when teacher knows about microtonality and<br/>writes such music, then there&apos;s a chance his/her students will follow<br/>this direction. Then more microtonal music will be performed (even<br/>from tape, that&apos;s enough) at concerts and help to increase interest<br/>from the side of public.<br/>Again this is a chance for composers who are able performers  as well<br/>- they are not dependent on performers.</p><p>- Musicological research is focused mainly on historical themes (by<br/>this I mean all music of the past, including that one written this<br/>year) and let&apos;s say standard music theory problems. There&apos;s still a<br/>lot what can be done, analysis, comparing, digging in archives etc. I<br/>didn&apos;t see much articles or essays - if any - targeting the future of<br/>the music, in the sense of Busoni&apos;s Entwurf einer neuen &Auml;sthetik der<br/>Tonkunst...</p><p>But everything depends on peoples. Where there&apos;s some enthusiastic<br/>person he/she can do a lot in popularisation and education in the<br/>field of microtonality. I don&apos;t think anybody will block such<br/>activities. This is what I&apos;m doing most of my music life as a<br/>composer, performer, musicologist, teacher and music writer. It&apos;s<br/>true I was considered maybe to be a dreamer, crazy fool, too much<br/>experimental or so, but I taught all my students about microtonality,<br/>they were forced to do microtonal works in our lessons, and in the<br/>end I had some followers among my students who started to like it<br/>(hi, Peter P) so I could be proud of them. Yes, we are still in<br/>minority, outsiders, or better said  solitaries, but our time will<br/>come one day. Besides all of us have nothing against common 12ET<br/>music and can make our living from it. We are not microtonal<br/>fundamentalists, why. It&apos;s only one of many possible ways how to make<br/>a music.<br/>And let&apos;s don&apos;t have any illusions: there are also superficial<br/>fashion followers among microtonalists, people doing pseudoartistic<br/>snobbery improvisations or experiments just because they are unable<br/>to do &quot;normal&quot; music, and most of microtonal works I have heard are<br/>quite uninteresting stuff because the authors have no deep formal<br/>music education as musicians and as composers mainly. Really high<br/>percent of redundancy, and pure garbage. But this is part of style<br/>development, there&apos;s always lot of garbage, and from time to time a<br/>diamond here and there... Microtonal music is still waiting on its<br/>Mozarts and Chopins with steady high quality artistic output.</p><p>And don&apos;t forget - even serialism and 12tone music has still lot of<br/>interesting, challenging and not quite exhausted fields to research.<br/>I will name just few which I&apos;m deeply involved in last years of my<br/>composing in this area: symmetry of all kind, work with three/four<br/>note motivic cells, scales and modes closed in wider interval than<br/>octave, tone groups with more than 12 members and repeated tones,<br/>work in grey zones between tonality/seriality, tonality/modality,<br/>seriality/modality...  nothing to say about unlimited possibilities<br/>in domains of metrorhythm, form/tectonics/architecture, layering,<br/>synchronicity, sound design and more...</p><p>Then all those possibilities of style synthesis, searching of common<br/>or different elements in world music cultures and intentional work<br/>with it... This is my life task.</p><p>So actual situation will change slowly and it must start from<br/>concrete individuals and public events - teachers, students,<br/>performers, composers, radio stations, CD publishers, agencies,<br/>concert and festival organizers, musicologists, conferences, music<br/>instruments manufacturers... Which in fact is exactly what we all<br/>together are doing, so it&apos;s on the right path, and we just can&apos;t<br/>expect quick results. It&apos;s a long term process. It can be another 100<br/>years, or maybe 250 or 500, who knows. Even contemporary music uses<br/>in fact the same material like old Greek music, for example, just the<br/>language was changed, the way how it is used. And we want to change<br/>basic material itself, which will ask also another language. Tough job.</p><p>Daniel Forro</p><p>P.S.: Academic community has its own rules, and it&apos;s very closed<br/>circle. Just another fresh example: my otherwise very successful,<br/>unusual and highly attractive concert tour with a ladies chamber<br/>group of Japanese traditional instruments in Czech Republic this May,<br/>where we performed historical and contemporary Japanese music besides<br/>my newest compositions, was well visited, but for example in my<br/>former domicile city of Brno, which I visited as a concert artist for<br/>the first time after 7 year stay in Japan (and I&apos;m still pretty well<br/>known there after 30 years of my stay, and concert was well<br/>promoted), only two of my acquaintance colleague composers came, one<br/>82 years old composer and middle age one. As far as I could recognize<br/>nobody of Music Conservatory and Academy  teachers, performers (lot<br/>of them my former schoolmates or colleagues) or young music students<br/>were present. So what we can expect from such attitude? There&apos;s no<br/>apology for them. These teachers should come in the first row,<br/>followed by all of their students, to use such interesting and rare<br/>opportunity to experience some unusual music. So this is a reality<br/>I&apos;ve been fighting with all my life there...</p><p>On 22 Aug 2010, at 4:44 PM, Mike Battaglia wrote:</p><p>&gt; I have been on this list for a few years, and I have probably learned<br/>&gt; more about music theory here than in all of my previous years of<br/>&gt; schooling combined.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; And I notice that I don&apos;t see the ideas on this forum echoed much<br/>&gt; within the academic community.

We all too often seem to make the mistake of relating things<br/>to more advanced terms WE know well instead of finding the creativity to put<br/>microtonal theories in terms of &quot;normal&quot; musical vocabulary.</p><p>  For example one way I think of temperament is just a side effect of that<br/>taking a circle of perfect fifths (IE (3/2)^7) creates a value more than an<br/>octave AKA power of two (IE around 17 instead of 16), so we shrink the fifth to<br/>make it exactly an octave.  And that compensation is called &quot;tempering out&quot;.<br/>And same sort of thing applies for circles of thirds, seconds...in other tuning<br/>systems IE it&apos;s a simple, consistent theory...not a bunch of random<br/>&quot;exceptions&quot;.</p><p>&gt;&quot;Or that since 49/48 is tempered out, an equal tempered tri-tone can approximate<br/>&gt;7/5 and 10/7 almost equally well?&quot;<br/>  Of course this sort of thing matters a lot.  The sad thing, as I see it, is<br/>that such PHDs are often thought of such things as an artifact of the technique<br/>of a certain era or composer...and not as a direct effect of the math and<br/>physics behind human hearing.</p><p>  I&apos;d almost compare it for them as asking &quot;Would you rather know that Escher<br/>was responsible for great art and what patterns he liked to use...or understand<br/>not only mathematical constructs like tesselations underlying his work, but<br/>knowing them well enough you can understand how they could be changed and used<br/>in ways he had not thought of?&quot;</p><p>   Or even...<br/>   &quot;Do you know why this consonance/dissonance/contrast works beyond the fact X<br/>established artists used it and/or it was a product of X time period?

The context in which I made my original point was that even for<br/>all of these people in academia who are terrified of other tunings,<br/>there&apos;s at the very least still a ton of insight to be gained into<br/>existing 12-equal music by using regular mapping. And applying a<br/>regular mapping perspective to 12-tet can certainly in itself lead to<br/>new scales and harmonic ideas - consider that 12-tet supports pajara,<br/>and all of the decatonic scales apply to 12-tet as well. And consider<br/>that 12-tet has excellent approximations to 17/16 and 19/16, which<br/>could possibly lead to some interesting musical territory (it implies<br/>256/255 vanishes, among other things).</p><p>So as you&apos;ve pointed out, the reason the above substitution works is<br/>that it&apos;s the only 5-limit rank 1 temperament eliminating 81/80 and<br/>128/125 (and 50/49 if we&apos;re going to go up to the 7-limit). ...Well,<br/>isn&apos;t that important knowledge? Even if you&apos;re completely<br/>xenharmoniphobic, is that not worthwhile knowledge to disseminate?<br/>Especially being as the goal of music theory is to understand how<br/>music works, even if only in 12-tet.</p><p>But wrt to your 11/8 substitution ideas, another one that makes for<br/>some strange chord progressions is in 22-equal, where 55/54 vanishes,<br/>and hence 27/20 and 11/8 are equated. So you can play chord<br/>progressions like C Eb+ G Bb+ D F+ -&gt; C E- G Bb D F+, where the F is<br/>held constant. It&apos;s pretty puntastic.</p><p>&gt; &gt; Either way, the fact is that even if you don&apos;t use the above scales,<br/>&gt; &gt; most of the same melodies are playable over C7 and F#7 without any<br/>&gt; &gt; intonational shifts whatsoever.

Now, if I could only figure out the &quot;big picture&quot; of how JI<br/>fits into all of this, I&apos;d be set for life. The fact that meantone[7]<br/>and superpyth[7] can substitute for each other basically destroyed any<br/>idea that I had of temperament being a warping of JI.</p><p>-Mike</p></div><h3><a id=92051 href="#92051">ðŸ”—</a>Kraig Grady &#x3C;kraiggrady@...&#x3E;</h3><span>8/27/2010 6:14:14 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>I am late in commenting on this thread  which places my comment out of order which i am sorry for.</p><p> From what i understand of the academic community is that they put a priority on actual composed music and are interested in theory only as it explains those works.

To make our<br/>theories provable...we need great music (not just considered great to us<br/>microtonalists, but also to the masses).  But to get great music (in that sense)<br/>often takes lots of musicians, with only the top few out of millions of aspiring<br/>ones making such music.  But to get so many musicians doing that in an art, you<br/>need for them to come in wanting to learn the theory.  Which in the case of<br/>micro-tonal (again) requires the theories to be proved.  It&apos;s a huge loop.</p><p>    Again it seems to point to my old suggestion of having a major pop act use<br/>micro-tonal as a staple of their style.  If someone on the same level as the<br/>Beatles, The Who, Beethoven, The Rolling Stones...who was known well for decades<br/>used microtonallity extensively...then you&apos;d IMVHO get tons of musicians wanting<br/>to learn it and, out of those, a few greats to keep the theory having the status<br/>of &quot;being worth passing on to the next generation&quot;.</p><p>   Another issue...I like liquid drum and bass and abstract trance music such as<br/>BT and Way Out West.  Which, admittedly, is never going to get anywhere near the<br/>popularity of bands like The Beatles or classical legends like Beethoven.  And<br/>to be real...I think neo-classical music, punk rock (with the exception perhaps<br/>of the genre&apos;s Godfathers, the Ramones), metal, world music, and many of the<br/>other genres focused on here have the same issue when it comes to lacking the<br/>level of popularity needed to get people to &quot;study micro-tonal works&quot; on a scale<br/>large enough to break into the realm of equal public awareness with 12TET.</p><p>   My guess is the best way to get micro-tonal music famous is to have a leading<br/>rock band with decent sex appeal take it over.  Hey, it&apos;s what the Beatles,<br/>Doors, Rolling Stones, Pearl Jam, Nirvana...and tons of teens got into music<br/>because of them and sometimes ended up starting very successful bands using<br/>musical techniques learned from them.  Start with a simple garage band, get more<br/>complex later on.<br/>  Another admitted path to being a classic/widely-memorable artist is hip-hop<br/>(2PAC, Notorious Big)...but then lyrics and beats often take precedence over the<br/>actual music theory.<br/>  And the ones who take on the more advanced side of those techniques became the<br/>Joe Pass&apos;s and new Beethoven&apos;s of the world.</p><p>   Now my question is where would we find such a musician to get the pattern<br/>started?</p></div><h3><a id=92062 href="#92062">ðŸ”—</a>genewardsmith &#x3C;genewardsmith@...&#x3E;</h3><span>8/27/2010 12:53:56 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, Michael &lt;djtrancendance@...&gt; wrote:</p><p>&gt;    Now my question is where would we find such a musician to get the pattern<br/>&gt; started?</p><p>You seem to be assuming that academic music people pay attention to popular music, which mostly they don&apos;t.

Or would industrial music have come around if it<br/>weren&apos;t for both heavy psychedelic rock and breakthrough groups like &quot;The<br/>Prodigy&quot;?</p><p>    Now if you compare early blues to modern industrial they seem as different<br/>as night and day...but I think it&apos;s fair to say they come from a chain of<br/>influence by popular groups, not because, say, some guy came up to a blues<br/>player and told him he should try E-minor scales, distorted leads, beat-boxes,<br/>and creepy sound effects just because a master of theory invented or suggested<br/>them.</p><p>------------------------------------------</p><p>    My greater point is; we can&apos;t just push people into wanting to learn<br/>micro-tonal music by telling them what it is and why it&apos;s great with a lot of<br/>intellectual authority.  You can&apos;t make many people want to &quot;join a religion&quot;<br/>just by being the world&apos;s expert on that religion.   IMVHO we need examples, not<br/>just solid academic explanations but fleeting examples...like the kind of<br/>examples groups like The Supremes, The Ramones, Led Zepplin, Kraftwerk, and<br/>countless others who &quot;crossed us over&quot; to new genres.   Note, many of these WERE<br/>academically inclined, BT and Metallica being two huge examples...but they<br/>didn&apos;t let academics be the be-and-end all of their work either.</p><p>   Coming back to Kraig&apos;s point...the music world follows the studies of<br/>existing works of music that are already considered great and tries to extract<br/>theory from it.  It does NOT only have to apply to academics studying the<br/>classics in music history...it could be as simple as a teenager reading tabs in<br/>Guitar World Magazine on the long path to becoming the kind of level my brother<br/>is at today.  Or something much bigger.</p></div><h3><a id=92077 href="#92077">ðŸ”—</a>Carl Lumma &#x3C;carl@...&#x3E;</h3><span>8/27/2010 4:06:47 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>:)  I don&apos;t care much for Floyd and I wasn&apos;t referring to<br/>theory.

There are really good<br/>rock pieces (Dance with the Moonlit Knight by Genesis say) but they are the<br/>exception. And included are some really hard to play solo instrumental parts<br/>- but those still do not compare to the best of the classical solo<br/>instrument repertoire.

You can multiply by 1200/1200.033 if you want a pure octaves tuning.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;</p></div><h3><a id=92130 href="#92130">ðŸ”—</a>genewardsmith &#x3C;genewardsmith@...&#x3E;</h3><span>8/29/2010 11:27:50 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, caleb morgan &lt;calebmrgn@...&gt; wrote:</p><p>&gt; Reduced Mapping<br/>&gt; 2&#x9;3&#x9;5&#x9;7&#x9;11&#x9;13<br/>&gt; [&lt;&#x9;1&#x9;1&#x9;-1&#x9;3&#x9;-2&#x9;0&#x9;]<br/>&gt; &lt;&#x9;0&#x9;3&#x9;17&#x9;-1&#x9;28&#x9;19&#x9;]&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Generator Tunings (cents)<br/>&gt; [1200.151, 234.118&gt;</p><p>&gt;  you should take 52.299 and multiply it by 600/600.016.

For a strict linear temperament, you can always choose one generator to be the octave. The other generator is then simply called &quot;the generator&quot;. For any regular temperament that approximates the octave, you can still choose one of the generators so that it equally divides the octave. This is then known as &quot;the period&quot;. Unequal temperaments where the period doesn&apos;t equal the octave are a hallmark of the regular mapping paradigm.</p><p>Again, I just want to know how to work with these numbers--forget all the questions I asked, which just illustrate my confusion.  They were intended to show that I take this seriously, and I&apos;m trying to understand what to do.<br/>It looks like it should be simple, but it isn&apos;t.</p><p>The basic idea of generators and a modulus is quite familiar to me, from other work.</p><p>The basic question is:  How to hand-calculate with the given information to come up with the tuning/scale that you intended.</p><p>caleb</p><p>On Aug 29, 2010, at 7:54 PM, Graham Breed wrote:</p><p>&gt; On 30 August 2010 02:39, caleb morgan &lt;calebmrgn@...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; What&apos;s the difference, then, between &quot;Rodan two dimensions higher&quot; and 41EDO?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; You don&apos;t need 41 notes of Rodan.
