At what period in music/acoustic history did<br/>the measurement of pitch by Hertz or cps become commonly known and<br/>useful? When did tuning forks (etc.) start to have their pitch in Hz<br/>stamped on them? What methods were used to measure and check pitch?</p><p>What I have found suggests that Sauveur was an important figure in the<br/>early scientific development, but details are lacking.</p><p>~~~Thomas~~~</p></div>
