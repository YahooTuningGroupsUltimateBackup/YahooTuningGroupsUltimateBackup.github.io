She can hardly claim<br/>propriety on this idea, in fact I can&apos;t even think what else government<br/>could be for.</p><p>The difficulty arises in defining &quot;rights&quot;.  Rand&apos;s gross<br/>oversimplification of this question leaves her reader with a clear idea of<br/>the problem, and no idea of the solution, although she deserves much credit<br/>for writing stories instead of essays.  I personally feel legislative<br/>systems are clearly un-suited to working out what &quot;rights&quot; are, and would<br/>prefer the whole mess done away with in favor of something like the<br/>judicial system (with a little less catering to an evolving system of<br/>precedents).</p><p>My point was that government is an emergent behavior- a free spirit.<br/>Nobody sits down and makes one.  The framers of the US Constitution found<br/>that out, if not while they were alive (with the unwanted appearance of<br/>political parties), then certainly by now.  The whole thing is clearly out<br/>of control, people acting out roles as in a play.  If government improves<br/>its longevity at the cost of it&apos;s citizen&apos;s rights, what&apos;s to stop it?<br/>Certainly not any piece of paper.</p><p>I&apos;ll check out Friedman.</p><p>-Carl</p></div>
