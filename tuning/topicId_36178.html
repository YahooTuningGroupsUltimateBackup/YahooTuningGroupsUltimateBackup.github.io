Absolutely nothing.</p><p>There will be no need to.  The archives will stay right here, and<br/>Robert Walker has backed them up on another website, at least the<br/>posts that he has been *authorized* to.</p><p>So they will all stay here on Yahoo until Yahoo goes &quot;belly up&quot; which<br/>Robert seems to think will be sooner than we might imagine.  Dunno.</p><p>If the *new* Tuning List is great, people will just &quot;migrate&quot; over<br/>there and continue the discussions over there, so there really is no<br/>necessity to *duplicate* posts on both list.</p><p>Certainly, *I* am interested in trying it, especially since I hear it<br/>will have a nice, *threaded* Web interface!  (Apologies, again,<br/>to &quot;textmaster&quot; Jon Szanto...  :) )</p><p>J. Pehrson</p></div>
