In the wake of the Renaissance revival of Euclidian geometry, Henricus Grammateus published in his arithmetic book of 1518 a simple diagram (fig.1)<br/><a href="http://www.law-guy.com/dummygod/Images/006567.gif">http://www.law-guy.com/dummygod/Images/006567.gif</a><br/>showing how the geometrical mean between two pipe lengths in the ratio 9:8 could be determined by drawing a semicircle on the sum of the lengths 9 and 8 taken as diameter, and then measuring the perpendicular from the juncture of the two lengths. By this means the Pythagorean whole tone would be, in theory, divided into two musically equal semitones. Grammateus referred to these as &grave;minor semitones&apos;, and other theorists later used that term to designate equal semitones on the lute (see &sect;9 below); but the context of the prescription leaves no doubt that he intended his &grave;amusing reckoning&apos; (&grave;kurtzweyllig rechnung&apos;) to be applied to organ pipes. Such a temperament would make both BÂ–F and BÂ–F sour, however, and even Barbour (1951), although ideologically attracted to it, described it as an organ tuning which &grave;may have been used in practice but hardly by anyone who was accustomed, like Schlick, to tune by ear&apos;. Nor does any extant Renaissance organ music avoid BÂ–F as well as BÂ–F....<br/>&quot;</p><p>Probably Mark would judge similar about Mario&apos;s rotated variant.</p><p>Margo remarks about that:<br/><a href="http://www.medieval.org/emfaq/harmony/pyth5.html">http://www.medieval.org/emfaq/harmony/pyth5.html</a><br/>&quot;<br/>...While forerunners of well-temperament might be traced back as far as an English organ tuning scheme of 1373 and the proposal of Henricus Grammateus (Heinrich Schreiber) in 1518, these systems seem more akin to equal temperament, and so will be discussed under that heading; also, such systems partially tame rather than fully domesticate the Wolf, leaving at least one fifth more than 10 cents from just...&quot;</p><p>That practical instruction is more tolerant:<br/><a href="http://www.hpschd.nu/index.html?nav/nav-4.html&t/welcome.html&http://www.hpschd.nu/tech/tmp/grammateus.html">http://www.hpschd.nu/index.html?nav/nav-4.html&t/welcome.html&http://www.hpschd.nu/tech/tmp/grammateus.html</a><br/>&quot;..The thirds are usable, especially when you get into the sharp keys, and the two baby wolves not impossible.

The 2/7 comma version sounds similar but slightly better with the improved fifths and major thirds, and the version in 1/4 comma meantone sounds better still in the open fifths (though not actually pleasant) and very euphonious in the triads. In 1/5 comma meantone, the fifths and major thirds are about the same distance from pure (though the third is wide and the fifth narrow), which means that they beat at a similar rate and create a kind of &quot;vibrato&quot; effect that some listeners find attractive. The 1/6 comma version is slightly better in the fifths but slightly worse in the major thirds, though they are still quite acceptable--a good compromise, perhaps. (The virtues of 1/6 comma meantone become evident with more complex harmonies.)(26) Finally, the equal tempered version exhibits excellent odd-numbered measures because its fifths are almost pure, but its major thirds are excruciatingly wide, causing the even-numbered measures to sound very sour and &quot;jangly.&quot;...<br/>&quot;<br/>Hence Galilei&apos;s quote confirms my own old view again:<br/>12-EDO := &apos;Tears in my ears!&apos;</p><p>Quest:<br/>Are there any newer thoughts about mixing such arithmetically<br/>1/7 and 2/7 parts SC reduced 5ths?</p><p>How does C:E:G = 4 : 5*SC^(+1/7) : 6*SC^(-1/7) sound in yours ears?</p><p>Or has anybody further hints for<br/>improvements and refinements<br/>of the above version an other time again?</p><p>bye<br/>Andy</p></div>
