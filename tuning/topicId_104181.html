In fact, at your suggestion (on top of an earlier one by Herman Miller) we asked Manuel Op de Coul to update the Sagittal implementation in Scala to include Mavila-based native-fifth notations for 16-EDO and 23-EDO. SET NOTATION SA16N or SET NOTATION SA23N.</p><p>They use the )||( (double scroll double shaft) accidental whose primary comma is 25/24 and two other accidentals with secondary commas of (25/24)^2 and (25/24)^3.</p><p>The updated Windows version is already available. It has other updates to sagittal, including new notations for 60, 120 and 180-EDO (thanks to Graham Breed), and at long last the Herculean and Olympian JI notations SAJI3 and SAJI4.
