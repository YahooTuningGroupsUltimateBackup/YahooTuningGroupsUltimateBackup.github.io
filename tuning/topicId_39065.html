531441:512000<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; BUT, as can easily be seen by factoring, this interval is simply<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; (81:80)^3 (or three syntonic commas).<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; as 81:80 (the syntonic comma) is distinguished (though conflated with<br/>&gt; the pythagorean comma, into an interval of 20.5 cents), not ignored,<br/>&gt; in this tuning, we have a bit of a conceptual contradition -- the<br/>&gt; syntonic comma is to be considered a full step in the 36-tone tuning,<br/>&gt; while three syntonic commas somehow are to be considered to add up to<br/>&gt; zero steps.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; torsion has been discussed at great length on tuning-math -- another<br/>&gt; classic example is helmholtz&apos;s 24-tone tuning system, which is just<br/>&gt;
