I wonder whether there is a more general pattern here - n-note MOS of (2n-1)-EDO - that would be worth being explored?</p><p>Yeah, I&apos;ve been thinking about that for a while. So you end up with:</p><p>5&amp;6 - machine temperament, 11-EDO primary chromatic EDO, 17-EDO<br/>primary enharmonic EDO<br/>6&amp;7 - either tetracot or 2.5.9 meantone temperament, 13-EDO primary<br/>chromatic EDO, 19-EDO primary enharmonic (meantone) 20-EDO primary<br/>enharmonic (tetracot)<br/>7&amp;8 - porcupine temperament, 15-EDO primary chromatic EDO, 22-EDO<br/>primary enharmonic EDO<br/>8&amp;9 - progression temperament, 17-EDO primary chromatic EDO, 26-EDO<br/>primary enharmonic EDO<br/>9&amp;10 - negri temperament, 19-EDO primary chromatic EDO, 28-EDO and<br/>29-EDO are both enharmonic EDOs<br/>10&amp;11 - miracle temperament, 21-EDO primary chromatic EDO, 31-EDO<br/>primary enharmonic EDO</p><p>This is a bit arbitrary because there are a few options for 6&amp;7, and I<br/>think there are a few for 10&amp;11 as well, so I&apos;ve listed what I feel is<br/>the most important temperament in each case.</p><p>This is related to the work we did on MODMOS a while ago. Temperaments<br/>like these have two diatonic-sized or &quot;albitonic&quot; scales, with which<br/>the smaller one might be said to be a &quot;haplotonic&quot; scale, analogous to<br/>meantone&apos;s pentatonic scale.</p><p>At any rate the &quot;primary chromatic&quot; EDO may not be the one with the<br/>best tuning (definitely not in the case of porcupine or miracle), but<br/>it does serve the purpose of being the simplest EDO that enables full<br/>chromatic modulation around the MOS in question. In that sense 15-EDO<br/>is cognitively simpler than 22-EDO for porcupine, but the tradeoff is<br/>that 22-EDO is more accurate. This is analogous to how 12-EDO is<br/>simpler than 19-EDO, but 19-EDO is more accurate. Simplicity may offer<br/>additional benefits in that the extra tempering can lead to simpler<br/>and more useful comma pumps, once you get over the higher tuning<br/>error.</p><p>I&apos;ve been exploring a new idea these days, which is that the<br/>categorical perception of intervals is really what matters, with<br/>purity of tuning being the icing on the cake. It might be a good idea<br/>to first &quot;establish&quot; a tuning in the listener&apos;s mind by playing a<br/>composition in a &quot;purer&quot; tuning (so start with quarter-comma meantone<br/>or TOP-RMS porcupine or TOP-RMS semaphore), and then translate that to<br/>the simpler EDO once the understanding of the temperament&apos;s &quot;logic&quot; is<br/>set up, which likely means the categorical perception of the<br/>temperament&apos;s intervals (then dumb it down to 12-EDO or 15-EDO or<br/>14-EDO).</p><p>-Mike</p></div><h3><a id=100577 href="#100577">ðŸ”—</a>Graham Breed &#x3C;gbreed@...&#x3E;</h3><span>7/6/2011 12:58:17 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>&quot;hstraub64&quot; &lt;straub@...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt; Today I was having a closer look at one of the pages of<br/>&gt; the italian site of Armodue<br/>&gt; (<a href="http://www.armodue.com/risorse.htm">http://www.armodue.com/risorse.htm</a>) and learned about<br/>&gt; something the Armodue makers call &quot;semi-equalized<br/>&gt; Armodue&quot;, and which is a temperament generated by two<br/>&lt;snip&gt;</p><p>&gt; A little point is that the xenwiki page of 31edo mentions<br/>&gt; this temperament as &quot;Valentine temperament&quot; - so there is<br/>&gt; a terminology issue here that might be kept in memory...</p><p>The Wayback Machine only has that page from 2004.
