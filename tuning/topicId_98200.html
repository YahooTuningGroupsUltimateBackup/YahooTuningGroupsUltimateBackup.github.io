Pascal&apos;s) triangle mod 7 (where the numbers 0<br/>to 6 represent &quot;do&quot; to &quot;si&quot;) defines a simple set of chords in the diatonic<br/>scale, if each chord is defined by the notes in a row of the triangle.<br/>Likewise, JI of course stays low-limit if interpretting those small numbers<br/>that way instead.</p><p>This &lt;<a href="http://www.mediafire.com/?5g6w9gflkhdzd6q">http://www.mediafire.com/?5g6w9gflkhdzd6q</a>&gt; is a very simple test tune<br/>I made a couple years ago (before having heard of nearly everything<br/>discussed on this list) when I was discovering that idea on my own. It<br/>begins in major, then does an inversion, then minor, and in the middle plays<br/>JI (all rows at the same time, but where a note&apos;s duration is divided by the<br/>number of notes in the same row), and then it winds back out the same way it<br/>came in. (It should keep octaves proper as well.)</p><p>I believe only the first 6 rows of the triangle are used in that audio file.<br/>You can see here&lt;<a href="http://mfi.re/imgbnc.php/24ae633c5ca01f09040e9e6393d3200aef2c88185f8411bf3a5f365587e8ab594g.jpg">http://mfi.re/imgbnc.php/24ae633c5ca01f09040e9e6393d3200aef2c88185f8411bf3a5f365587e8ab594g.jpg</a>&gt;that<br/>the same pattern from the first 7 rows occurs repeatedly in the full<br/>triangle, with some additional variations.</p><p>Anyway, I was wondering what of interest has been done with this idea. When<br/>I did it, the results were suprisingly usual and regular to me, and it<br/>seemed as though such patterns might be useful for some kind of standard<br/>musical progression or perhaps something at least.</p></div><h3><a id=98202 href="#98202">ðŸ”—</a>Daniel Nielsen &#x3C;nielsed@...&#x3E;</h3><span>4/18/2011 10:13:54 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>BTW, since it wasn&apos;t clear in my message: at the time the audio file was<br/>created, I was just using the standard arithmetic triangle without mod n.</p></div>
