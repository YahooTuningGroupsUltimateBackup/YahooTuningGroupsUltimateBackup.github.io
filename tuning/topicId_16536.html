The theramin<br/>is harder than many instruments iin that it is not only completely<br/>non-fixed pitch but is non-tactile as well. From what I understand, it<br/>also reacts with ANY nearby masses, so not only do you have to be very<br/>precise with your hand and arm motions, you have to be nearly imobile<br/>everywhere else.</p><p>The late Clara Rockmore was &apos;the&apos; virtuoso in its glory years and has<br/>a CD out, &apos;The Art of the Theremin&apos; I believe.
