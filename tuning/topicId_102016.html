With something like<br/>100,000,000 members, it may be possible to find some people who wouldreally be interested in areas of music that are very specialized with<br/>not-too-many enthusiasts passionate about them.</p><p>Composers and performers with an interest in all the notes &quot;between<br/>the notes.&quot; Just intonation, non-12 tone equal temperaments or hybrid<br/>systems. It&apos;s all harmony.</p><p>There&apos;s an image from the microtonalist group showing a math symbol<br/>for the 12th root of two crossed out - kind of cute if it&apos;ll show<br/>here.&#x263A;     Best   Dave</p></div>
