When I was a child,<br/>I studied the violin and pla-yed in a student orchestra. It was<br/>already at that time that I started to compose music and to<br/>orchestrate. After school I entered the Radio Transmission Department<br/>at the Institute of Communication. One day as I was reading an issue<br/>of the journal Techology and Youth, I came across an an article<br/>titled &quot;A Composer Draws Music.&quot; This article described a very<br/>interesting musical instrument, caled the ANS, on which you could<br/>&quot;draw&quot; a piece<br/>of music, after which the drawing could be heard as sound. I was so<br/>much interested in the idea that I imediately contacted the inventor<br/>of this machine - the article inclu-ded a contact address. I was able<br/>to find him at the Scriabin Museum in Moscow. There, on the second<br/>floor of the museum, in a small hall, stood a working and sounding<br/>experimental sample of the instru-ment and Evgeny Alexandrovich<br/>Murzin, the inventor of the instrument, gave lectures about acoustics<br/>and music and presented small concerts featuring short musical<br/>fragments, composed on the instru-ment. The fragments were<br/>writtenmostly by two composers, who at that time were regularly<br/>working with the ANS, Andrei Volkonsky and Nikolai Nikolsky. These<br/>short musical pieces demonstrated the diverse and contrasting timbral<br/>possibilities of this new instrument. I made the acquaintance with<br/>Mur-zin and expressed my fascination with the instrument and my<br/>willingness to assist him in the work of perfecting the synthesizer.<br/>Murzin found a position for me at the Institute for Applied<br/>Mechanics,<br/>where he was the director of a laboratory, which developed a working<br/>experimental sample of this ma-chine. He established forme a work<br/>regime, which gave allowance for an extraordinary possibility - half<br/>of each week I worked in the laboratory as a technician and soldered<br/>various parts of the instrument while the other half I spent in the<br/>Scriabin Museum, where I experimented with the synthesis of sound at<br/>the instrument. At that time I had written several pieces for the<br/>instrument, a selection of which was published on an LP record,<br/>issued<br/>by the Melodiya record company, which featured some of the first<br/>recordings of Russian electronic compositions, composed on the ANS<br/>synthesizer. The name of the in-strument is derived from the initials<br/>of Alexander Nikolayevich Scriabin, to whose memory Murzin de-dicated<br/>his invention. The director of the Scriabin Museum at that time,<br/>Tatiana Grigorievna Shaborki-na, established a haven for the<br/>electronic music specialists, who created such a wonderful<br/>instrument,<br/>since she believed their work carried to a great degree the spirit of<br/>Scriabin and his musical and philoso-phical innovation.<br/>&#x9;Thus, in the Scriabin Museum, under the solicitous patronage<br/>of its director, a small electronic studio was created. Soon after<br/>that two young composers, who had just finished their studies at<br/>Mos-cow Conservatory, appeared in the studio; they were Eduard<br/>Artemiev and Alexander Nemtin. We quickly became friends and soon<br/>after that they became my teachers and mentors in my attempts to<br/>compose music. Artemiev, subsequently, became a well-known composer<br/>of<br/>electronic music and film music. Nemtin, on the other hand, was soon<br/>to start working on a huge project - the completion of Scriabin&apos;s<br/>mystical composition Prefatory Action for orchestra, chorus, solo<br/>piano and color organ, the idea of which was thought of by Scriabin,<br/>who did not live to compose it, past a few sketches. Nemtin<br/>successfully completed his project in 1996 after 26 years of intense<br/>work and it was recently performed in numerous European and American<br/>cities. Alexander Nemtin played a very important role in my mu-sical<br/>development. He taught me virtually the full Conservatory course,<br/>comprising all the musical and theoretical subjects, taught at the<br/>composition department. I regularly visited him in Perlovka, a suburb<br/>of Moscow, where he lived at that time, and he gave me private<br/>lessons. He was a very strict and de-manding teacher and he gave me a<br/>lot of homework assignments, especially in counterpoint and<br/>com-position. His own compositions were very apealing to me,<br/>especially his Piano Sonata N.1. I developed lifelong friendly<br/>relations with Nemtin, which lasted until he passed away in February,<br/>1999. Everything which he composed at that time, I helped him to<br/>record at the studio, which was just voluntary help on my part, out<br/>of<br/>friendship. At that time composers had to show their compositions,<br/>especially their or-chestral works, regularly at committees of the<br/>Ministry of Culture and the Muzfond (State Musical Foundation). We<br/>made recordings at the Scriabin Museum, which had very god recording<br/>equipment for those days, and then, later, we spliced them together.<br/>He wrote many experimental electronic com-positions for the ANS<br/>synthesizer, among which I can mention, first of all, his Grand<br/>Suite.<br/>His short, lyrical composition Tears and his arrangement of Bach&apos;s<br/>Chorale Prelude in C major, both for the ANS, were recorded on our<br/>first LP record, featuring compositions for the ANS, which was<br/>published by the Melodiya record company. We also successfully<br/>collaborated to a great degree with Artemiev - we even had a joint<br/>project, comissioned by a comittee of exhibitions. We had to write<br/>music for a gra-phic film, which was supposed to be shown<br/>simultaneously on several screens, called Into Outer Space. The<br/>artist<br/>Andrei Sokolov drew the sequences for this film. This was a<br/>ten-minute<br/>slide, which projected onto five screens simultaneously. Different<br/>pictures, which were drawn in it, moved about by means of a certain<br/>type of new technology, changed and transformed themselves into one<br/>another. This was not a multiplicative cartoon type of movie, but a<br/>different type - the type, which is now made, utili-zing several<br/>slide<br/>projectors at once: piling one slide on top of another and their<br/>mutual transformation. We wrote the music for this film together with<br/>Artemiev in collaboration, altogether about ten minutes of music and<br/>it was presented in several Soviet exhibitions abroad, where the film<br/>was shown - in Lon-don, Paris and Rio de Janeiro. The music was<br/>written as a suite, consisting of several short movements, each one<br/>corresponding to a scene of the film. The suite was presented on our<br/>first LP record in a slight-ly shortened version.</p><p>ROVNER: Can you tell us something about Evgeny Murzin and the<br/>circumstances of his invention of the ANS synthesizer? What motives<br/>did he have, and how is the ANS constructed in purely technical terms?</p><p>KREICHI: Evgeny Alexandrovich Murzin came up with the idea of the ANS<br/>for the first time in 1938. He was a big admirer of Scriabin and of<br/>his music. He sensed that Scriabin felt constricted within the<br/>twelve-tone equal-tempered scale and he frequently tried to free<br/>himself from its shackles by many purely timbral-coloristic<br/>instrumental means, such as by using an abundance of trills and<br/>blending toge-ther various extremely contrasting instrumental<br/>textures. This perception of Scriabin&apos;s music had inspi-red Murzin<br/>with the idea of extending the intervallic system and presenting<br/>musicians with a totally new type of instrument, which would give the<br/>possibility of creating new sounds, extending by far the con-straints<br/>of the twelve-tone equal-tempered tuning system. It is well known<br/>that<br/>before our times music existed in more natural types of tuning<br/>systems, such as, for instance, the tuning system of just<br/>intona-tion,<br/>and that is still used in a variety of folk instruments, as well as<br/>when strings tune in perfect fifths, not to mention chorus singing a<br/>capella. The chief fault of the natural tuning systems was that they<br/>did not allow easy modulation, as they did not possess enharmonic<br/>relations between the sharps and flats - the ability to modulate<br/>easily from key to key is one of the most important acquisitions of<br/>the twelve-tone equal-tempered tuning system. Murzin&apos;s idea was to<br/>find a way to enlarge the quantity of the oc-tave&apos;s components into<br/>more than twelve parts, so that it would enable natural intervals to<br/>be included as part of the instrument&apos;s musical language. This system<br/>would include enharmonic relationships among the natural intervals,<br/>at least certain ones, which are close to each other, as well as the<br/>ability to modulate more freely within the framework of the natural<br/>intervals. These were the thoughts that took hold of Murzin in 1938,<br/>and he meticulously tried to find ways of inactivating these ideas<br/>through tech-nical means. Here the recent invention of sound-track<br/>movies inspied Murzin with additional ideas. In sounding movies,<br/>sound<br/>or music is endowed with a &quot;visual&quot; aspect by means of the soundtrack<br/>on the film. This invention immediately gave rise to ideas that if we<br/>can &quot;see&quot; sound on the screen, then simi-larly we could draw it<br/>independently and, processing it through motion-picture equipment, we<br/>could come up with a sound which was created by other means than<br/>those of a musical instrument.<br/>This way, the first ideas of graphical synthesis of sound appeared<br/>together with the invention of sound-track movies. A predecessor of<br/>Murzin in this field was the scientist Evgeny Alexandrovich Sholpo.<br/>He<br/>made experiments by drawing sound-waves manually on pieces of paper,<br/>then photogra-phing them on film and then &quot;sounding them out&quot; by<br/>passing them through sound eqipment, which created isolated sounds,<br/>determined by the shapes of the drawn sound-waves. Following this, he<br/>crea-ted a special type of machine, called the variaphone, with the<br/>aid of which one could process the picture of the sound-wave onto a<br/>movie screen almost automatically. The variaphone enabled Sholpo to<br/>create sound-accompaniment to a number of movies in the 1930&apos;s. The<br/>idea of visually designed sound was picked up by Murzin and this<br/>became the basic idea for the creation of the synthesizer. However,<br/>Mur-zin followed a different line of thinking than Sholpo. Instead of<br/>drawing soundwaves each time, he de-cided to create a bank of<br/>soundwaves, which were available in sufficient quantities. His<br/>invention was a disc, similar in size and appearance to a<br/>contemporary<br/>CD, but made of photographic plate, with soundtracks printed on it,<br/>similar to those existig on a movie screen. Each soundtrack was very<br/>narrow in terms of width - one third of a millimeter. One disc<br/>contained 124 sound tracks. Murzin pondered for a long time upon the<br/>question of the number of sounds in to which he was to divide the<br/>octave. He came up with 72, since that was a number which contained<br/>in<br/>itself the 12-note scale (the equal-tempe-red scale), the 24-note<br/>scale (the quarter tone scale), as well as a number of other<br/>important scales, con-sisting of numbers of tones by which the number<br/>72 could easily be divided. He thought this very con-venient, so the<br/>first<br/>sound disc was created with 72 soundtracks and this remained the<br/>number of soundtracks in all the sub-sequently created discs. As<br/>Murzin continued to work on creating this new sound-machine, the next<br/>step of his was to transform this disc into a musical instrument.<br/>First he placed this disc into a special revolving equipment, passing<br/>it through light, which already became modulated and, when touching<br/>the photo-element, transformed itself into an electronic signal of<br/>sound frequency, and, finally, as a result, into a sound-unit.<br/>Nevertheless, the sound-unit, though being the most impor-tant<br/>component of music, does not comprise it entirely. Sounds had to<br/>change, to pass and transform into one another, to have different<br/>rhythmic durations and different pitches, and only then one could<br/>connect several of them at once and come up with at least a melody in<br/>the first instance. This is why the next step was to create a<br/>mechanism, which was later called the &quot;score&quot; (being, in all essence,<br/>a score of a piece of music). This was a big glass rectangular-shaped<br/>plate, covered with non-transparent mastic. If the glass plate was<br/>placed in such a way as to shield the sound-disc from the light, then<br/>the light was co-vered and no sound was heard. But as soon as one<br/>would peel or scrub off a bit from the mastic and make a tiny rift or<br/>stroke in the mastic, then a ray of light would penetrate though it<br/>and one of the soundtracks would start to sound. If several such<br/>rifts<br/>or strokes would be made on one vertical plane. That would result in<br/>a<br/>sounding chord. If the strokes were placed one above the other in<br/>such<br/>a way as to compile the over-tone series in full or in part, then the<br/>chord would transform itself into a well-blen-ded timbre.<br/>As a result, five phonogram discs were made, which revolved in<br/>different speeds. Each subse-quent disc revolved at a speed which was<br/>four times quicker than the preceding disc. One disc contai-ned two<br/>octaves of soundtracks written down on it. The subsequent disc<br/>revolved four times as fast as the preceding one, so that the two<br/>octaves were transposed two octaves above; the next one was<br/>modu-lated<br/>an additional two octaves higher, and so forth. In this manner, the<br/>five discs covered the range of ten octaves from 20 Herz to 20,000<br/>Herz, that is, they covered the entire range of sound, perceptible by<br/>the human ear. The result was that this estabished bank of sounds<br/>consisted of 720 pure sounds or sound-wave oscillations. The task of<br/>acquiring pitch and timbre was successfully completed.<br/>Now Murzin had to solve the problem of applying different durations<br/>as<br/>well as dynamics to the &quot;score&quot; of the instrument. First of all, the<br/>instrument had to &quot;read&quot; the written strokes n the right time<br/>succession, bringing in the dimension of time into the usage of the<br/>instrument. He devised as the &quot;reading eye&quot; a narrow crack, through<br/>which the modulating light, which would have already penetra-ted the<br/>picture, would reach the photo-element. Of course one could read a<br/>text in many different ways. One could skim through a written line<br/>with ones eyes or one could take a different approach - move the line<br/>of text and show it through the narrow &quot;window,&quot; so that it could be<br/>read, fragment after fragment (as in a running line of a displayed<br/>advertisement text). It was this second approach that Murzin applied<br/>to the ANS. The role of the small &quot;window&quot; was taken by the &quot;reading<br/>gap.&quot; With this kind of cons-truction, when the plate carrying the<br/>strokes printed on the mastic moved, each of the drawn strokes would<br/>sound at the precise time duration that it was exposed to the<br/>&quot;reading<br/>gap,&quot; through which the light penetrated. This way the length of the<br/>drawn stroke corresponded with the duration of the sound, and the<br/>tempo was determined by the speed of the movement of the pate itself.<br/>The plate, covered with the non-drying mastic, was called the &quot;score&quot;<br/>by Murzin, as one could &quot;draw&quot; on it a number of simul-taneously<br/>sounding melodies, chords and many other sound combinations.<br/>Moreover,<br/>each sound could either be a pure sound or it could contain any<br/>number<br/>of drawn overtones, which meant that the sounds on the score could be<br/>created in different timbres. So that people working on the ANS would<br/>not have to calculate each time the distances which the overtones<br/>covered, but could always have them available in a form ready to be<br/>used, another device was invented - what was called the coder. This<br/>was a scale, written out as a piano keyboard, which was located at<br/>the<br/>left side of the score, as well as a mo-ving frame or carriage with<br/>established cutters, which could be fixated near each<br/>pitch-indicating<br/>key and, moreover, could fixate smaller steps between each adjacent<br/>key, determining microtones up to one sixth of a semitone. One could<br/>combine together this compilation of cutters and by this means to<br/>regu-late the make-up and the intensity of the sound of each<br/>overtone.<br/>One could interfere very virtuosically in the sound-structure of each<br/>sound, alter it and create more variable types of timbres, unlike<br/>most<br/>syn-thesizers and electric organs, in which, for the most part, a<br/>certain timbre is called in by pressing a but-ton, which then usually<br/>remains unaltered during the course of a performance.<br/>Here, when each sound was &quot;notated&quot; and one had the ability to alter<br/>each sound by means of alterations of the &quot;picture,&quot; it was possible<br/>to &quot;liven up&quot; and &quot;invigorate&quot; the timbre of each sound. It was<br/>already in this format that the preliminary working model of the ANS<br/>was set up in the Scriabin Museum and the first group of musicians<br/>and<br/>composers had already gathered around it, who worked with<br/>experimenting with creating new sounds by means of this instrument,<br/>the greatest amount of effort of which was put in the quest of<br/>various<br/>timbres. First of all, the musicians wanted to find the means to<br/>recreate the timbres that were already available on standard<br/>orchestral instruments. This was the specialty of Eduard Artemiev. He<br/>went as far as to compile a whole catalogue of timbres, created on<br/>the<br/>ANS, with examples of the sounds and their &quot;drawings&quot; - this was a<br/>very interesting type of work. In addition there were also attempts<br/>to<br/>find new sounds and timbres that were not available on other<br/>in-struments and which gave the ANS its unique qualities of being an<br/>indispensable sound source in the sphere of musical instruments. As a<br/>result of all this work with the ANS, a great amount of short pieces<br/>for the instrument was written, a selection of which was published in<br/>our first LP record, devoted to music for the ANS.</p><p>ROVNER: In what year was the ANS synthesizer created?</p><p>KREICHI: As far as I know, the working model of the ANS was already<br/>available in 1958. It was inte-resting to note that Evgeny<br/>Alexandrovich constructed it himself manualy over a long period of<br/>time, during the times that he stayed in his summer house. He started<br/>his work in 1938 when he conceived the idea of the instrument in his<br/>mind, and after twenty years from then the active model was ready to<br/>be used. This is not the instrument, which is presently located at my<br/>studio at Moscow University, but its predecessor - a wooden model,<br/>constructed by Murzin himself. As soon as it was made, it was<br/>transported to the Scriabin Museum. Murzin went through a great<br/>amount<br/>of difficulties when con-structing it - it was definitely not that<br/>easy to construct a new instrument on which you can provide sound<br/>accompaniment to a movie. Moreover, a great amount of time was spent<br/>on creating the matrix of the disc of the optical phonogram, since a<br/>special kind of machine-tool had to be invented and built, on which<br/>one could inscribe precisely inscribe the sound-tracks on the edge of<br/>the disc. There the goal was to have the beginning of the first<br/>circular period of sinewaves to combine precisely with the end of the<br/>last period, so that there would not be any break in between them,<br/>because the least bit of inaccura-cy in this circulation would create<br/>a snap in the rhythm of the rotation of the phonogram circle. The<br/>in-strument, which is located in my studio at Moscow State<br/>University,<br/>was the final result of Murzin&apos;s ex-perimental quest; its<br/>manufacturing followed that of the preliminary working model and it<br/>essentially comprised the Electronic Music Studio in Moscow. The<br/>instrument was considered to be a qualified sample of industry. It<br/>was<br/>built in 1963, and there were many difficulties present in its<br/>creation as well, since Murzin&apos;s laboratory was part of a crucially<br/>important institute, which dealt with manufacturing of technical<br/>devices and featured a lot of work connected with national defense.<br/>This type of musical expe-rimental work was not considered of primary<br/>importance and was continuously postponed and stret-ched out in time,<br/>as a result of which the project was carried out very slowly, even<br/>after all the plans for construction were ready and all the component<br/>parts were gathered together to assemble into this indu-strial<br/>sample.<br/>Despite the fact that everything was all ready to go, it took a long<br/>time to undertake the final assemblage and compilation of the<br/>instrument. What finally gave a boost towards the completion of the<br/>project was the Soviet Industrial Exhibition in Italy, which was<br/>planned at the time. The Ministry of Radio Industry, under the<br/>auspices of which the institute existed, was searching for such<br/>exponents for this exhibition, which could be demonstrated with great<br/>success. Demonstrating various types of measuring devices of general<br/>usage was not very intriguing for most people. When they found out<br/>that such an interesting machine was being created, on which it was<br/>possible to draw music, the exhibition committee became very<br/>enthusiastic about such an idea and held onto it. This served as such<br/>a strong boost for our work that literally in a matter of months the<br/>ANS synthesizer was finally assembled, completed and its entire<br/>electronic mechanism was polished and perfected and it was finally<br/>able to sound. In March, 1964, together with Murzin we went to the<br/>exhibition to Italy and took the ANS synthesizer along with us.</p><p>ROVNER: When was the electronic music studio finally opened and which<br/>ANS instrument was in use there at the time?</p><p>KREICHI: As I mentioned earlier, the preliminary working model stood<br/>in the Scriabin Museum strar-ting from 1958 and composers started<br/>working on it at around that time. I arrived in 1960, and later on<br/>Nemtin and Artemiev appeared there too. The only two composers there<br/>who worked there for the first two years was Andrei Volkonsky and<br/>Nicolai Nikolsky. Schnittke, Denisov and Gubaidulina appeared there<br/>much later, when the Electronic Music Studio was officially opened on<br/>the first floor of the Scria-bin Museum. Before that, there was a<br/>large residential apartment located on the first floor in which about<br/>ten families lived. After we had returned from Italy, the laboratory<br/>of the institute had already been dissolved, since it had<br/>successfully<br/>completed its task. In 1964, after we had returned, the ANS stood for<br/>nearly a year at the VDNKh (Exposition of the Achievement of the<br/>People&apos;s Production) in the Pavilion for Radio Technology. There it<br/>was continued to be demonstrated to the public, and some of the<br/>composers went there regularly to work with it, especially those who<br/>were writing film music. Among them were such well-known names as<br/>Andrei Eshpai and Gennady Gladkov. At the same time that the<br/>synthesizer was dislayed at the Exposition of the Achievements of the<br/>People&apos;s Production, Murzin carried out the task of creating and<br/>establishing the Electronic Music Studio. He was able to ob-tain<br/>permission from the government to open this studio as a branch of the<br/>Ministry of Culture and un-der the patronage of the Melodiya record<br/>company. The Moscow city authorities gave the first floor of the<br/>mansion, where the Scriabin Museum was located, to the Electronic<br/>Music Studio. It was a big treat to the museum as well, since they<br/>now<br/>had become the owners of the entire mansion, whereas, previ-ously,<br/>its<br/>ownership was limited to the second floor, where the Museum-Apartment<br/>was located. Here two problems were solved simultaneously - a space<br/>for the Studio had been found and the Museum was expanded. The<br/>families inhabiting the apartment were also favored, since now they<br/>were each given a separate apartment in other parts of Moscow. The<br/>first floor of the mansion was cleared and immedi-ately rebuilt for<br/>the purposes of the Studio. According to the project of a small group<br/>of architects, the rooms of the studio work as well as a small<br/>concert<br/>hall were built, to present concerts of electronic mu-sic as well as<br/>demonstrations of color-music. Experiments in color music were also<br/>an<br/>important part of the musical goals of the Studio, following<br/>Scriabins<br/>theories of synthesis of music and color, as well as his attempts to<br/>create a color-organ. These experiments were worked upon a great deal<br/>by Mark Se-myonovich Malkov, who was an engineer by profession.<br/>Murzin<br/>was the director of the Studio, though he was for the most part busy<br/>the ANS synthesizer, which was already active. At that time he was<br/>wri-ting a book on the reserves and resources of musical hearing.<br/>Evgeny Alexandrovich had done an ex-tensive amount of research in the<br/>field of audible perception of intervals of pitch and had made two<br/>pre-sentations of his research in an international symposium in<br/>Florence. He utilized the results of his long-time labor in the field<br/>of this research by writing a book about seven-hundred pages long,<br/>which there are now attempts being made to publish under the auspices<br/>of Moscow Conservatory. Murzin wrote the book within the time span of<br/>two years - between 1968 and 1970. He passed away in 1970, less than<br/>four years after the Electronic Music Studio in Moscow was officially<br/>opened.<br/>(con&apos;t in part II)</p></div><h3><a id=20358 href="#20358">ðŸ”—</a>Haresh BAKSHI &#x3C;hareshbakshi@hotmail.com&#x3E;</h3><span>3/22/2001 2:54:15 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In tuning@y..., jpehrson@r... wrote:<br/>&gt; The following article is a reprint from the periodical 20th Century<br/>&gt; Music... so this is only for &quot;educational&quot; purposes.<br/>.....................<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Particularly interesting, though, is the way the Soviet authorities<br/>&gt; tried to suppress electronic music...<br/>&gt;</p><p>I do not know why the Soviet authorities tried to suppress electronic<br/>music.
