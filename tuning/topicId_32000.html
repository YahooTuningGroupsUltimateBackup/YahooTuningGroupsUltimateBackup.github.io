However, these same<br/>theorists advocate other types of tuning systems for keyboards, and<br/>for flexibly intoned music such as that of vocal ensembles.</p><p>Vicentino in 1555 advocates a 31-note meantone cycle likely based on<br/>pure or near-pure major thirds (1/4-comma meantone or 31-tET), and<br/>realized on his archicembalo or superharpsichord. He also describes an<br/>alternative tuning for his keyboard, with 36 notes in all, achieving<br/>what appears to be a form of adaptive just intonation.</p><p>Zarlino takes 5-limit just intonation (modelled on Ptolemy&apos;s syntonic<br/>diatonic, as applied to modern practice in 1529 by Fogliano) as the<br/>ideal basis of vocal harmony, but notes that a fixed tuning would<br/>involve complications such as impure fifths (40:27) narrow by a<br/>syntonic comma which singers seem to avoid. He concludes that such<br/>singers, unlike fixed keyboards in 5-limit just intonation (the<br/>experimental exception rather than the rule), make fine adjustments to<br/>obtain the desired consonances.</p><p>For keyboard instruments, he describes his 2/7-comma temperament in<br/>1558 (with major and minor thirds equally impure), and in 1571 gives<br/>an account also of 1/4-comma meantone (&quot;not difficult&quot; to tune) and<br/>1/3-comma meantone (&quot;languid&quot; in quality).</p><p>As is well known, 16th-century keyboard music (and much vocal music)<br/>fits nicely within a 12-note meantone tuning such as the most typical<br/>Eb-G#, observing the diesis distinction (e.g. G# vs. Ab); and for more<br/>adventurous music, larger keyboards may make available anything from a<br/>split key or two (e.g. G#/Ab, Eb/D#) to a 19-note or 31-note gamut.</p><p>Of course, there is no inconsistency in observing that 12-tET was a<br/>standard for fretted instruments as early as the mid-16th century<br/>(with Mark Lindley pointing to some evidence in 15th-century visual<br/>art for similarly equal frettings), but did not become a keyboard<br/>standard until the era of 1850-1900 or so.</p><p>Lindley, by the way, strongly recommends meantone for some early<br/>16th-century lute music, and also emphasizes how the equal fretting of<br/>viols could be &quot;bent&quot; by skillful players to fit a prevailing meantone<br/>kind of ensemble feeling. Some theorists report that the different<br/>tunings of keyboards (meantone with unequal semitones) and lutes<br/>(12-tET) caused problems when these instruments were mixed in<br/>ensembles.</p><p>On a keyboard, Renaissance meantones not only make available pure or<br/>near-pure 5-limit thirds and sixths so nicely fitting the style of<br/>this era, but also strikingly unequal semitones (around 117 cents and<br/>76 cents in 1/4-comma meantones) adding a special quality to chromatic<br/>passages. Vicentino&apos;s music additional uses as an integral melodic<br/>step the 41-cent enharmonic diesis or fifthtone defined by the<br/>difference between these semitones -- or the similar 39-cent step of<br/>1/31 octave in a 31-tET realization of his music.</p><p>The main point I would make is that medieval Pythagorean intonation,<br/>Renaissance meantone or adaptive JI for flexible ensembles, and also<br/>Baroque-Romantic well temperaments all have distinctive musical<br/>qualities.</p><p>Of course, when we also consider the Pythagorean or near-Pythagorean<br/>tunings of Chinese and Japanese traditions, the customized intonations<br/>and regional affinities of Balinese and Javanese gamelan, and the<br/>compressed octave tunings of African xylophone music, for example, the<br/>picture of pluralism becomes immeasurably richer.</p><p>As a regular tuning, 12-tET could be seen as something of a compromise<br/>between medieval Pythagorean and Renaissance/Manneristic/Baroque<br/>meantone -- or as the levelling out of the distinctions in an unequal<br/>12-note well-temperament. It also happens to be a very convenient<br/>scheme for fretting a lute or similar instrument where multiple<br/>strings will be played at the same time in polyphonic textures -- a<br/>point made by Vincenzo Galilei in the late 16th century.</p><p>In introducing people to the range of intonations even in a single<br/>compositional family of traditions like those of Western Europe, I<br/>would emphasize that intonational diversity can reflect also the<br/>diversity of musical styles, for example:</p><p>        (1) Medieval polyphony based on a contrast between<br/>            pure fifths and fourths and complex thirds and sixths<br/>            (Pythagorean intonation), in comparison with the<br/>            restful and stable thirds of the Renaissance (meantone<br/>            or adaptive 5-limit JI);</p><p>        (2) Open Pythagorean and meantone systems -- or meantone<br/>            cycles of 19 or 31 -- in contrast with the typically<br/>            unequal 12-note well-tempered cycles of the era<br/>            1680-1850; and</p><p>        (3) The &quot;key color&quot; favored in 18th-19th century schemes<br/>            of well-temperament, in contrast to the uniformity<br/>            of 12-tET.</p><p>By the end of the 19th century, conceptually at least, 12-tET was seen<br/>as a &quot;standard&quot; -- but sometimes with the reservation that new<br/>technologies (e.g. the Bosanquet generalized keyboard of this era)<br/>would make available the resources of &quot;just&quot; and &quot;mean&quot; intonations.</p><p>Here I would add that what has prevailed historically should not be<br/>taken as an exhaustive guide to what is musically beautiful or<br/>practical, but it can serve as a very helpful source of perspective<br/>when a single tuning is taken more or less by default as &quot;standard.&quot;</p><p>Most appreciatively,</p><p>Margo Schulter<br/><a href="mailto:mschulter@value.net">mschulter@value.net</a></p></div><h3><a id=32041 href="#32041">ðŸ”—</a>monz &#x3C;joemonz@yahoo.com&#x3E;</h3><span>12/28/2001 11:37:53 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>&gt; From: &lt;<a href="mailto:Afmmjr@aol.com">Afmmjr@aol.com</a>&gt;<br/>&gt; To: &lt;<a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>&gt;<br/>&gt; Sent: Friday, December 28, 2001 6:39 AM<br/>&gt; Subject: Re: [tuning] Re: A common misconception?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; In a message dated 12/28/01 4:17:57 AM Eastern Standard Time,<br/>&gt; <a href="mailto:joemonz@yahoo.com">joemonz@yahoo.com</a> writes:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; Re Brahms:  he was so conservative as to retain the old<br/>&gt; &gt; valvless horns and trumpets in his scores because of his<br/>&gt; &gt; stated love of their JI pureness, presumably referring<br/>&gt; &gt; primarily to the 5-limit pitches and possibly in some<br/>&gt; &gt; instances to the 7-limit ones.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Swafford specifically says in his Brahms bio that it is for reasons of<br/>tone<br/>&gt; that Brahms&apos;s preferred valveless horns.

Nothing about<br/>&gt; tuning in there.  The fact that Mahler was conducting &quot;strange&quot; orchestras<br/>&gt; all the time would seem to indicate that he accepted the differences of<br/>&gt; different orchestras, and then used his personality to impress upon the<br/>&gt; players his preferences.  Many, many orchestral musicians disliked<br/>Mahler&apos;s<br/>&gt; manner for this reason.</p><p>Yep... Mahler was *famous* for being a tyrant of a conductor.</p><p>That&apos;s why, now that I *know* that Mahler regretted the abandonment<br/>of meantone, that I have such a strong gut feeling that he would<br/>have imposed a meantone-like intonation upon his orchestras.</p><p>Since I&apos;ve found that Josef Petzval was lecturing on and<br/>demonstrating 31-EDO at the Univsersity of Vienna at precisely<br/>the time that Mahler attended that school in his teens, there&apos;s<br/>at least a possibility that Mahler became quite familiar<br/>with 31-EDO/meantone at that time.</p><p>Mahler also used double-sharps very often in his scores,<br/>which I take as another indication that he was thinking in<br/>meantone.  In the Critial Edition of his scores, now accepted<br/>as the standard, these double-sharps have invariably been<br/>changed to the naturals which in 12-EDO are enharmonically<br/>equivalent, for the sake of &quot;easier reading&quot;... and I<br/>think that&apos;s a sacrilege, because it obliterates whatever<br/>intonational nuance Mahler had in mind when he wrote the<br/>double-sharp.</p><p>It should be noted that Schoenberg himself instituted this<br/>procedure of replacing double-sharps with 12-EDO equivalent<br/>naturals in his published scores, as early as the _Chamber<br/>Symphony_, which I believe was published in 1907.</p><p>Alma vaguely documents many arguments that Mahler had with<br/>Schoenberg about compositional matters during 1904-7.  I&apos;m<br/>fairly certain that one or more of them would have been about<br/>intonation, since Schoenberg ultimately (in 1908) accepted<br/>12-EDO after he himself flirted with quartertones.</p><p>(Note that Schoenberg didn&apos;t act on this decision until<br/>*after* Mahler left Vienna for New York, indicating again<br/>the strong devotion Mahler&apos;s personality exuded from those<br/>who were close to him.  Even a few years later, Schoenberg<br/>had intended to dedicate his _Harmonielehre_ to Mahler as it<br/>was being written in 1910, but Mahler died before it was<br/>published, so the dedication became a memorial, in which<br/>Schoenberg called Mahler a &quot;saint&quot;, and which ends:<br/>&apos;... it is my wish that this book bring me such recognition<br/>that no one can pass over my words lightly when I say:<br/>&quot;He was an altogether great man&quot; &apos;.)</p><p>The argument between Mahler and Schoenberg, which Alma<br/>specifically documents, about _klangfarbenmelodie_ (melody<br/>of timbres), and Mahler&apos;s statement after hearing the<br/>_Chamber Symphony_ in 1907 that he was &quot;too old to have an<br/>ear for&quot; Sch&iuml;&iquest;&half;nberg&apos;s music, &quot;was perhaps referring directly<br/>to his loss of the ability to hear high frequencies, due to<br/>aging and daily exposure to the volume of 100-piece orchestras.&quot;<br/>That&apos;s quoted from my &quot;A Century of New Music in Vienna&quot;<br/>webpage, under the year 1907:<br/><a href="http://www.ixpres.com/interval/monzo/schoenberg/Vienna1905.htm">http://www.ixpres.com/interval/monzo/schoenberg/Vienna1905.htm</a><br/>(be on guard for the loud music that will open with the page).<br/>Schoenberg&apos;s hearing was quite apparently sensitive enough to<br/>perceive some higher overtones.</p><p>BTW, isn&apos;t the Alma diary a fascinating read?

In 1842 The Organ of St Nicholas, Newcastle-upon-Tyne<br/> was tuned to equal temperament this is believed to be the first Organ<br/> to be tuned in equal temperament in England for a concert. Willis the<br/> organ builder did not use equal temperament until 1854.  However,<br/> [in] 1846 Walter Broadwood directed Mr. Hipkins, the head piano tuner<br/> at Broadwood&apos;s, to instruct their tuners in the use of equal temperament.<br/> Mr.Hipkins used two tuning forks: one for Meantone and one for equal<br/> temperament (Meantone) A433.5 (Equal) A436.0.&quot;</p><p>The &quot;Mr. Hipkins&quot; referred to is the author of:</p><p>Hipkins, Alfred James.  1893.<br/>   &quot;Tuning.&quot; A Dictionary of Music and Musicians.<br/>   London: Macmillian and Company.</p><p>Hipkins apparently had a method for tuning 12-ET that was more accurate<br/>than those used by other tuners.</p><p>From our own Ed Foote, at<br/>&lt;<a href="http://www.ptg.org/archive/pianotech/1999/v1997.n1879">http://www.ptg.org/archive/pianotech/1999/v1997.n1879</a>&gt;:</p><p>&gt; To: <a href="mailto:pianotech-digest@ptg.org">pianotech-digest@ptg.org</a><br/>&gt; Date: Sun, 8 Aug 1999 08:00:04 EDT<br/>&gt; From: <a href="mailto:A440A@AOL.COM">A440A@AOL.COM</a><br/>&gt; Subject: Re: Historical temperamentals<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; ...<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;     To assume that the tuners of the early 1800&apos;s were  working their way<br/>&gt; through the various temperaments until they finally were tuning the most<br/>&gt; difficult, newest, and least documented style of tuning in 1850 is, in my<br/>&gt; opinion,  a mistake.  Reinforcing this is the documentation done at the<br/>&gt; Broadwood factory in 1850, where Hipkins states the tuners weren&apos;t tuning<br/>&gt; anything like equal temperament.  I suggest that whatever was going out<br/>the<br/>&gt; door of the factory was most closely indicative of what the general<br/>&gt; piano-buying public favored.  This is still true today, and means that<br/>when<br/>&gt; the factorys begin shipping their pianos in well temperaments,<br/>&gt; a landmark has been reached.  ( I am not holding my breath)<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;     The strongest evidence for temperament variety is the analysis<br/>Jorgensen<br/>&gt; presents of Ellis&apos;s findings in 1885,  35 years after Hipkins had<br/>&gt; &quot;instructed&quot; the tuners at Broadwood&apos;s to tune in ET.   Scientific<br/>&gt; measurement at the time was advanced enough for credibility, I think, and<br/>&gt; these results clearly show a strong bias for the same style of inequality<br/>&gt; that had been recognized for over 150 years.  Is it just coincidence that<br/>the<br/>&gt; factory tuners of 1885 were still tuning temperments that followed the<br/>intent<br/>&gt; of Werckmiesters rules?  That the harmonic form was the same, just varying<br/>by<br/>&gt; degrees?

See also: Classic JI, Fixed JI.</p><p>|||||B. Adaptive Temperament - Adaptive tuning where both harmonic<br/>and melodic intervals are tempered, but where the degree of<br/>temperament is relatively small and may be calculated specifically<br/>for a given piece of music.

Depending on exactly<br/>how sophisticated Mahler&apos;s harmonic technique was -- and I would<br/>definitely it&apos;s in the upper bracket -- it probably involves<br/>adaptive tuning more than adaptive JI.</p><p>Mahler&apos;s approach was basically pretty diatonic except for the<br/>last two symphonies (9 and 10), and 1 to 8 would have at least a<br/>few moments in which a close adherence to JI would sound best<br/>and would still work.  In 9 and 10 I&apos;d say that he had learned<br/>quite a bit from Schoenberg, and was doing stuff that would<br/>rely a lot more on some form of temperament, whether 12-EDO,<br/>meantone, or adaptive tuning.</p><p>My extensive study of Schoenberg has really given me a new<br/>appreciation of his use of the 12-EDO tuning.  From what I&apos;ve<br/>been able to discern, he chucked microtonality and stuck<br/>with 12-EDO primarily for the very pragmatic reasons of<br/>performance and income.  So his challenge was to find a<br/>way to use that tuning to express the expanded harmonic<br/>ideas in his imagination.</p><p>His abandonment of the principles of traditional tonality<br/>provided him with a few years (1908-14) in which he could<br/>explore the more-or-less totally free use of the 12-EDO<br/>pitch-set.</p><p>But his composing was interrupted by his term of service<br/>in the army during World War 1, and during and after the<br/>war he felt a real need to find a system of structural<br/>tonal manipulation to replace the hierarchical system of<br/>tonality which he had given up.  Schoenberg had a few contacts<br/>with Josef Hauer during this time, and this resulted in<br/>his formulation of the &quot;Method of Composition With 12<br/>Tones Related Only To Each Other&quot; around 1920, popularly<br/>known as &quot;serialism&quot; or &quot;the 12-tone method&quot;.</p><p>Of course Mahler never went this far, and one of the<br/>main reasons I like his music so much is that some of it<br/>explores some distant reaches on the edges of tonality,<br/>but much of it is comfortably diatonic-based.

I didn&apos;t mean to imply that *none* of Schoenberg&apos;s<br/>serial work was as good as his early work.  In fact, two of his<br/>very finest compositions are the _String Trio_ and _A Survivor<br/>From Warsaw_, written near the end of his life and fully serial.</p><p>What I wish to emphasize is that (in my opinion):</p><p>1) Schoenberg&apos;s late-romantic style, as exhibited in early pieces<br/>such as _Verkl&iuml;&iquest;&half;rte Nacht_ (still by far his most popular),<br/>_Pelleas und Melisande_, the _1st Quartet_, and especially<br/>_Gurrelieder_, has a wealth of expression couched in an idiom<br/>which most listeners would find very palatable and with which<br/>they would not feel uncomfortable, and which certainly would<br/>have resulted in great financial success and a much more<br/>comfortable life had Schoenberg continued in that vein;</p><p>2) His &quot;free atonality&quot; works and their immediate precursors,<br/>starting with the _Chamber Symphony_ and including:</p><p>  - the 2nd Quartet<br/>  - _Friede auf Erden_ (for choir, preferably _a capella_)<br/>  - 3 Pieces for Piano, op. 11<br/>  - 5 Orchestral Pieces, op. 16<br/>  - _Erwartung_ (opera)<br/>  - 6 Little Pieces for Piano, op. 19<br/>  - _Die Gl&iuml;&iquest;&half;ckliche Hand_ (opera)<br/>  - _Pierrot Lunaire_<br/>  - _Herzgewachse_</p><p>display an incredible facility of invention and a desire to<br/>break free of all compositional restraints.  His expressed<br/>goal during this period was to compose music that was &quot;nothing<br/>but pure feeling&quot; with no formal limitations, and I think a<br/>really good performance of any of these pieces will convince<br/>any receptive listener that he succeeded beyond even his own<br/>wildest dreams; and</p><p>3) [most of all, and the point behind posting all this here]<br/>I&apos;m convinced that Schoenberg would have become one of the<br/>first top-rank microtonal composers if *he* had been convinced<br/>that it was economically viable in his lifetime.  As I&apos;ve pointed<br/>out before, my conclusion is that Schoenberg decided to accept<br/>the limitations of the 12-EDO scale for primarily financial<br/>reasons, and because he had found a way *out* of those limitations<br/>which allowed him to use all 12 notes in ways freer than those<br/>available under the strictures of traditional harmony, but<br/>but still following a rigorous method developed out of the<br/>innate structure of the tuning itself.</p><p>It&apos;s been said (I think originally by Lou Harrison) that<br/>Schoenberg was the first composer to face up to the acoustical<br/>facts of the 12-tone scale.</p><p>&quot;Modern&quot; composers since Wagner were trying to express music for<br/>which their training -- grounded in Pythagorean and meantone<br/>tunings, whether they knew it or not -- had ill-prepared them.</p><p>By the time Schoenberg came along, 12-EDO had become the<br/>accepted standard tuning, and Schoenberg recognized the<br/>limitations and inconsistencies that were built into it in<br/>terms of traditional meantone-based music-theory -- for instance,<br/>the fact that D# and Eb are written differently but are supposed<br/>to be the same note.  ... or are they?  This thread has opened<br/>up the question of exactly what intonation late-romantic<br/>composers had in mind, and it&apos;s not necessarily an easy question<br/>to answer.</p><p>Schoenberg&apos;s experiments of 1899-1906 had already put him at the<br/>forefront of the &quot;modern&quot; school.  Then in 1906 there were some<br/>momentous developments in the German musical world regarding<br/>microtonality: Richard H.

Isn&apos;t there a well-documented<br/>instance where he &quot;turned his back&quot; to the audience, figuratively if<br/>not literally at a performance (I believe in Vienna) where there was<br/>*lots* of applause, but by then he had already gone into<br/>more &quot;advanced&quot; methods??</p><p>By the way... this kind of &quot;evolution&quot; is, of course, part of the<br/>baggage with practically *every* great artist, no?  The inability to<br/>stay put with the comfortable, even if something new fails to a<br/>degree...</p><p>That could be an important tenet for incipient (not incipid)<br/>microtonal composers as well!  :)</p><p>&gt;<br/>&gt; 2) His &quot;free atonality&quot; works and their immediate precursors,<br/>&gt; starting with the _Chamber Symphony_ and including:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;   - the 2nd Quartet<br/>&gt;   - _Friede auf Erden_ (for choir, preferably _a capella_)<br/>&gt;   - 3 Pieces for Piano, op. 11<br/>&gt;   - 5 Orchestral Pieces, op. 16<br/>&gt;   - _Erwartung_ (opera)<br/>&gt;   - 6 Little Pieces for Piano, op. 19<br/>&gt;   - _Die Gl&uuml;ckliche Hand_ (opera)<br/>&gt;   - _Pierrot Lunaire_<br/>&gt;   - _Herzgewachse_<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; display an incredible facility of invention and a desire to<br/>&gt; break free of all compositional restraints.  His expressed<br/>&gt; goal during this period was to compose music that was &quot;nothing<br/>&gt; but pure feeling&quot; with no formal limitations, and I think a<br/>&gt; really good performance of any of these pieces will convince<br/>&gt; any receptive listener that he succeeded beyond even his own<br/>&gt; wildest dreams; and<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; 3) [most of all, and the point behind posting all this here]<br/>&gt; I&apos;m convinced that Schoenberg would have become one of the<br/>&gt; first top-rank microtonal composers if *he* had been convinced<br/>&gt; that it was economically viable in his lifetime.  As I&apos;ve pointed<br/>&gt; out before, my conclusion is that Schoenberg decided to accept<br/>&gt; the limitations of the 12-EDO scale for primarily financial<br/>&gt; reasons, and because he had found a way *out* of those limitations<br/>&gt; which allowed him to use all 12 notes in ways freer than those<br/>&gt; available under the strictures of traditional harmony, but<br/>&gt; but still following a rigorous method developed out of the<br/>&gt; innate structure of the tuning itself.<br/>&gt;</p><p>***** Well, there is certainly no question in my mind after reading<br/>_Harmonielehre_ that Schoenberg thought a *lot* about tuning.</p><p>Whether he had it all wrong, as Harry Partch seems to attest or not,<br/>he *did* spend quite a bit of time thinking about it.</p><p>With him, though, the *practical* necessities held out.  I think,<br/>though, that for a composer in an &quot;advanced&quot; idiom he *did* have<br/>quite a few performances during his lifetime so, maybe he really<br/>*did* know what to do, despite all his complaining late in life...</p><p>&gt; It&apos;s been said (I think originally by Lou Harrison) that<br/>&gt; Schoenberg was the first composer to face up to the acoustical<br/>&gt; facts of the 12-tone scale.<br/>&gt;</p><p>*****Yeppir.  Doesn&apos;t surprise me at *all* that Lou would be on S&apos;s<br/>side!  (Take that, &quot;nutty professor!&quot;)</p><p>&gt; &quot;Modern&quot; composers since Wagner were trying to express music for<br/>&gt; which their training -- grounded in Pythagorean and meantone<br/>&gt; tunings, whether they knew it or not -- had ill-prepared them.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; By the time Schoenberg came along, 12-EDO had become the<br/>&gt; accepted standard tuning, and Schoenberg recognized the<br/>&gt; limitations and inconsistencies that were built into it in<br/>&gt; terms of traditional meantone-based music-theory -- for instance,<br/>&gt; the fact that D# and Eb are written differently but are supposed<br/>&gt; to be the same note.  ... or are they?  This thread has opened<br/>&gt; up the question of exactly what intonation late-romantic<br/>&gt; composers had in mind, and it&apos;s not necessarily an easy question<br/>&gt; to answer.<br/>&gt;</p><p>****There was a recent post to this list, I think Heinz, who seemed<br/>to attest to the &quot;residue&quot; of meantone even in Wagner.</p><p>Monz...

He had a harder time<br/>in America, because even tho he was famous here as a *personality*,<br/>and as a teacher, his compositions were barely known.  He applied for<br/>Guggenheim fellowships, as an old man, so that he could supplement<br/>his very meager income from UCLA and so that he&apos;d have time to<br/>compose more, and the committee turned him down.  He was not able<br/>to retire at 65 because of this, and he stayed in his position at<br/>UCLA until his health no longer permitted him to work.

As I wrote,<br/>the choice I eventually end up instituting in the retuning of my<br/>Mahler audio-files will very likely be some combination of meantone,<br/>12-EDO, and adaptive-JI ... or in other words, an adaptive-tuning<br/>which mimics the three of those, different ones being given different<br/>weight at different times.  I think this is most likely the kind<br/>of tuning which would have resulted from a real orchestral performance<br/>of Mahler&apos;s music under his own baton.</p><p>And Mahler&apos;s two gods were Beethoven and Wagner, so certainly, the<br/>largest roots of Mahler&apos;s harmonic practice would stem from theirs,<br/>especially Wagner&apos;s.</p><p>&gt; Monz...

At least, that&apos;s a possible<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; interpretation.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; [me, monz]<br/>&gt; &gt; Joe, it&apos;s important to remember that Schoenberg actually did serve<br/>&gt; &gt; in the German army during World War 1 -- that&apos;s the *biggest* reason<br/>&gt; &gt; for the hiatus in his composing.  Another big reason: immediately<br/>&gt; &gt; after the war, Schoenberg formed his &quot;Private Society for Musical<br/>&gt; &gt; Performances&quot; in Vienna, and he was very busy overseeing that<br/>&gt; &gt; endeavor for the couple of years it existed.  Also, his financial<br/>&gt; &gt; situation was very shaky from the time he quit his job as a bank<br/>&gt; &gt; clerk (at age 16) until he took an academic position in Berlin<br/>&gt; &gt; in the early 1920s.  I think *that&apos;s* why he was able to get back<br/>&gt; &gt; to composing again: because he finally had a job that enabled him<br/>&gt; &gt; to survive, so that he could find some free time to compose.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Monz... aren&apos;t you discussing a period very *early* in S&apos;s life??  I<br/>&gt; mean much *later,* AFTER the &quot;free atonality&quot; stage.  I believe he<br/>&gt; quit composing for 10 years until he came up with the 12-tone<br/>&gt; system...</p><p>Joe, I don&apos;t mean to imply that artistic reasons had *nothing*<br/>to do with the c. 1914-1920 hiatus in Schoenberg&apos;s composing,<br/>but only to stress that there were indeed many other activities<br/>intruding on his life during that time which made it difficult<br/>to work.</p><p>Certainly, after a few years of freewheeling inspiration immersed<br/>in the &quot;free atonality&quot; style, Schoenberg began yearning for a<br/>means of tighter structural control in his use of pitch resources.</p><p>In fact, at some points during the &quot;hiatus&quot; he was working on<br/>_Jakobsleiter_, which he never did finish, and *this* was the<br/>piece where he first starting experimenting with cyclical use<br/>of the entire 12-EDO pitch-class set.  It was originally a huge<br/>symphonic project (not entirely unlike Ives&apos;s _Universe Symphony_),<br/>but was altered drastically over the years and decades as<br/>Schoenberg kept attempting to resume work on it.</p><p>There was quite a correspondence going on between Schoenberg and<br/>Hauer during this time, and unfortunately musical history has<br/>really not given Hauer the credit he deserves for the role he<br/>played in the development of the 12-tone method.</p><p>Now, this discussing is really veering off-topic and should<br/>continue on Metatuning, unless microtonality creeps back in<br/>in a big way...</p><p>-monz</p><p>_________________________________________________________<br/>Do You Yahoo!?<br/>Get your free <a href="https://twitter.com/yahoo">@yahoo</a>.com address at <a href="http://mail.yahoo.com">http://mail.yahoo.com</a></p></div><h3><a id=32283 href="#32283">ðŸ”—</a>paulerlich &#x3C;paul@stretch-music.com&#x3E;</h3><span>1/3/2002 7:37:58 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In tuning@y..., klaus schmirler &lt;KSchmir@z...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; monz schrieb:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; I saw that.
