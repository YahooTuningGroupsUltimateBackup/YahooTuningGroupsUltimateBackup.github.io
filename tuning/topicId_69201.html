It&apos;s &gt; not the sprawling prairie of possibilites, it&apos;s a subtle thing.  Not specifically Bach-appropriate, but a few years back I spent some time coming up with Yamaha-appropriate WTs. That is, each step of the Yamaha DX7II tuning table is almost exactly 1/20 of a Pythagorean comma. So I created temperaments in which the fifths were all tempered by 1/20, 1/10, 3/20, 1/5, or 1/4 of a comma.</p><p>The temperament of each fifth, starting with C-G, then G-D, D-A, etc.</p><p>Werckmeister III for comparison:<br/>1/4 1/4 1/4 0 0 1/4 0 0 0 0 0 0</p><p>A few of my well-temperaments that I&apos;ve mentioned on this list:<br/>&quot;Arrow I&quot;: 3/20 3/20 1/4 3/20 3/20 0 0 0 3/20 0 0 0<br/>&quot;Arrow II&quot;: 3/20 3/20 1/5 3/20 3/20 1/20 0 0 1/10 0 0 1/20<br/>&quot;Bug I&quot;: 3/20 1/4 1/4 3/20 0 0 1/10 0 0 1/10 0 0<br/>&quot;Butterfly I&quot;: 3/20 1/5 1/10 1/5 3/20 0 0 1/10 0 1/10 0 0</p></div>
