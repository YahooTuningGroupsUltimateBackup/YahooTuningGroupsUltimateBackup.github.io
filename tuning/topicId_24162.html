I&apos;ll be going back to<br/>&gt; check out more of your stuff. I had been working on the same scale<br/>&gt; form from another vantage point. I reversed the L and s and had for<br/>&gt; all practical purposes a 9 of 24</p><p>&gt;  L   s   L   s   L   s   L   s   L<br/>&gt; 0 204 249 453 498 702 747 951 996</p><p>This is a fascinating scale, and interestingly could be one<br/>interpretation (or approximation for a fixed-pitch instrument) of the<br/>vocal intonation system advocated by Marchettus of Padua in 1318. He<br/>calls for pure 2:1 octaves, 3:2 fifths, 4:3 fourths, and 9:8<br/>whole-tones, plus the use of cadential dieses equal to &quot;one of the<br/>five parts of a tone.&quot;</p><p>When I first saw your scale, I took it as a kind of 9 out of 29<br/>(although 9 out of 24 is also quite close), but then realized that it<br/>could exactly fit one late Gothic model deriving from Pythagorean<br/>tuning -- if we take a rounded 204 cents, for example, to represent a<br/>pure 9:8 (~203.91 cents), and so forth.</p><p>What this looks like to me, in rounded cents, is the precise dividing<br/>of each Pythagorean diatonic semitone or limma (256:243, ~90.22 cents)<br/>into two equal parts of around 45 cents (~45.11 cents). These parts<br/>are sometimes known in late medieval theory as &quot;diaschismas,&quot; with a<br/>whole-tone equal to &quot;four diaschismas plus a comma.&quot;[1]</p><p>Since a usual Pythagorean diatonic scale has five tones and two<br/>diatonic semitones or limmas, dividing each semitone in half gives us<br/>your nine-tone scale, or 5L + 4s.</p><p>What makes your scale especially radical is that the 45-cent steps are<br/>used _in place of_ the usual Pythagorean semitones, rather than in<br/>addition to them. It&apos;s maybe a bit of &quot;Marchettus meets Dan Stearns,&quot;<br/>and I mean that as the deepest of compliments all around.</p><p>&gt; I&apos;m showing the symmetrical form, I don&apos;t really have a modal<br/>&gt; preference yet). I was playing around with dyadic resolutions, two<br/>&gt; of which seemed effective (at least I could wander off and come back<br/>&gt; to them).</p><p>&gt; 453 -&gt; 702              204 -&gt; 249<br/>&gt; 249 -&gt;  0               996 -&gt; 951</p><p>Here the two left-hand resolutions, as you suggest in your reference<br/>to my neo-Gothic posts, look like usual neo-Gothic: basically a small<br/>minor third to unison (249-0) and a large major third to fifth<br/>(453-702).</p><p>Am I correctly reading these two dyadic resolutions as together<br/>defining the following three-voice progression, with degree numbers<br/>from ^0 to ^9 used to identify the steps of the scale from unison to<br/>octave inclusive, along with the position of each step in cents on<br/>your diagram (e.g. ^5=702), an approach which at least avoids imposing<br/>a usual diatonic worldview:</p><p> ^2=1404 -- + 45 -- ^3=1449<br/> (453)              (702)<br/> ^7=951  -- -204 -- ^6=747<br/>(702,249)          (702,0)<br/> ^5=702  -- + 45 -- ^6=747</p><p>This 9-tone scale has all kinds of possibilities in terms of<br/>specialized progressions available only on certain degrees, and the<br/>like -- a new kind of &quot;map&quot; to explore!</p><p>The two right-hand resolutions suggest to me what I&apos;m tempted to call<br/>&quot;neo-Renaissance suspensions,&quot; although there are 14th-century<br/>precedents also: I might take 204-249 as going from a usual major<br/>second to a small minor third (also possibly a large major second),<br/>and 996-951 as from a usual minor seventh to a large major sixth (also<br/>possibly a small minor seventh).</p><p>If these are suspensions or suspension-like resolutions in a<br/>Renaissance manner, I&apos;d take it that they involve oblique descending<br/>motion. Is this the intended three-voice reading, with the outer<br/>voices forming an octave, and the lower voice descending from ^9 to ^8<br/>while the other two remain stationary?</p><p>^0=1200<br/>^9=996  ^8=951<br/>^0=0</p><p>This gives us a 996-951 resolution between the lower voices, and a<br/>204-249 resolution between the upper voices, maybe suggesting<br/>something like the Renaissance 7-6 and 2-3 suspensions (the latter, as<br/>in this reading, involving stepwise descent of the _lower_ of the pair<br/>of voices while the upper one remains stationary).</p><p>Please let me apologize if my three-voice interpretations are<br/>mistaken -- but regardless, your mix of dyadic resolutions plus the<br/>special qualities of this scale as a 9-note set could open the way to<br/>some really new musics. Using an interval such as 249 cents or 951<br/>cents as a point of repose and resolution seems to me a door to<br/>beckoning universes -- a not inappropriate anticipation at the<br/>beginning of a new century and millennium.</p><p>Above all, I&apos;d say, congratulations!</p><p>----<br/>Note<br/>----</p><p>1. To see how an approximate ninefold division results, let us start<br/>from the usual division of the 9:8 tone into a diatonic semitone or<br/>limma (~90.22 cents) plus a chromatic semitone or apotome (2187:2048,<br/>~113.69 cents). The apotome exceeds the limma by a Pythagorean comma<br/>(531441:524288, ~23.46 cents), so we can divide the tone into two<br/>limmas plus this comma. Each limma, in turn, divides into two<br/>45.11-cent diaschismas, giving us in all four diaschismas plus a<br/>comma. If we take a 45.11-cent diaschisma as roughly twice a<br/>23.46-cent comma, then our two limmas or four diaschismas come to<br/>something like eight commas -- which, together with the remaining<br/>Pythagorean comma, gives approximately nine in all. As a diagram may<br/>suggest, this approximation is quite close, although half a diaschisma<br/>is actually slightly less than a Pythagorean comma:</p><p>  ~PC    ~PC     ~PC    ~PC     PC     ~PC    ~PC    ~PC    ~PC<br/>~22.56 ~22.56  ~22.56 ~22.56 ~23.46  ~22.56 ~22.56 ~22.56 ~22.56<br/>|------|------|------|------|-------|-------|------|------|------|<br/>  diaschisma    diaschisma      PC     diaschisma    diaschisma<br/>    ~45.11c       ~45.11c    ~23.46c     ~45.11c       ~45.11c<br/>|-------------|-------------|-------|--------------|-------------|<br/>            limma               PC               limma<br/>           ~90.22c           ~23.46c            ~90.22c<br/>|---------------------------|-------|----------------------------|<br/>   apotome -- 2187:2048 (~113.69c)    limma -- 256:243 (~90.22c)<br/>|-----------------------------------|----------------------------|<br/>|----------------------------------------------------------------|<br/>                              9:8 tone<br/>                              ~203.91c</p><p>Most appreciatively,</p><p>Margo Schulter<br/><a href="mailto:mschulter@value.net">mschulter@value.net</a></p></div><h3><a id=24251 href="#24251">ðŸ”—</a>Mats &#xFFFD;ljare &#x3C;oljare@hotmail.com&#x3E;</h3><span>6/1/2001 3:32:38 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>&gt;Lars, that 9-of-17tet was a nice little piece.
