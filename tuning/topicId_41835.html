The harmonic ones<br/>I can see at at glance, eg : -</p><p>3-5-11, 1-3-5, 3-5-7, 3-5-9  - by factoring out 3 and 5 you get 1 - 7 -<br/>9 - 11.</p><p>What I can&apos;t see at a glance is how the following gives a subharmonic<br/>tetrad : -</p><p>1-5-7, 5-7-9, 1-7-9, 1-5-9.</p><p>Any clues as to how to spot the subharmonic tetrad from the CPS or do I<br/>have to go to the ratios and work it out from there?</p><p>While I&apos;m on I&apos;d like to ask anyone who has worked with the Eikosany<br/>(Kraig mainly) if they find it easier to work at it thinking in terms of<br/>CPS, ie 1-3-5, etc. or by using note names ie, A, A+ etc. I find the<br/>former easier as with familiarity I get faster at seeing the common<br/>factors, but I&apos;m wondering if it&apos;s a better investment of time to learn<br/>structures as named notes.</p><p>Many thanks in anticipation</p><p>Kind Regards<br/>a.m.</p></div><h3><a id=41841 href="#41841">ðŸ”—</a>Carl Lumma &#x3C;clumma@yahoo.com&#x3E; &#x3C;clumma@yahoo.com&#x3E;</h3><span>1/12/2003 1:16:55 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Alison Monteith &lt;alison.monteith3@w...&gt; wrote...<br/>&gt;Looking at Kraig&apos;s &apos;tree toad&apos; article there&apos;s a section where<br/>&gt;alternate complete harmonic and subharmonic tetrads are formed.</p><p>We don&apos;t usually call them complete, because they each lack<br/>two of the identities used to define the tonespace in which<br/>the CPS is embedded (usually for the eikosany, it&apos;s 11-limit<br/>JI [1 3 5 7 9 11], and we only have tetrads).</p><p>&gt;What I can&apos;t see at a glance is how the following gives a<br/>&gt;subharmonic tetrad<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; 1-5-7, 5-7-9, 1-7-9, 1-5-9.</p><p>Here&apos;s the long-division way, applicable to both harmonic<br/>and subharmonic tetrads...</p><p>- Remove all factors common to each point.<br/>(there aren&apos;t any)<br/>- Multiply the remaining terms together for each point<br/>and sort to express the tetrad as a harmonic series segment.<br/>(35 45 63 315)<br/>- If the numbers are too big it may be more convenient<br/>to express each point as a ratio.<br/>(1/1 9/7 9/5 9/8)</p><p>For subharmonic tetrads, you can just pick one of the points,<br/>call it 1/1, and find the ratios between it and the other<br/>points in your head...</p><p>- The ratios for the other points all have the same numerator.<br/>It&apos;s the one factor they all have in common.</p><p>- The denominator for a given other point is the factor in<br/>your 1/1 point that doesn&apos;t appear in that other point.</p><p>-Carl</p></div><h3><a id=41842 href="#41842">ðŸ”—</a>Alison Monteith &#x3C;alison.monteith3@which.net&#x3E;</h3><span>1/12/2003 1:50:48 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>&quot;Carl Lumma &quot; wrote:</p><p>&gt; Alison Monteith &lt;alison.monteith3@w...&gt; wrote...<br/>&gt; &gt;Looking at Kraig&apos;s &apos;tree toad&apos; article there&apos;s a section where<br/>&gt; &gt;alternate complete harmonic and subharmonic tetrads are formed.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; We don&apos;t usually call them complete, because they each lack<br/>&gt; two of the identities used to define the tonespace in which<br/>&gt; the CPS is embedded (usually for the eikosany, it&apos;s 11-limit<br/>&gt; JI [1 3 5 7 9 11], and we only have tetrads).</p><p>Thanks - I didn&apos;t know that. &apos;Complete&apos; is the term used in the article.</p><p>&gt; &gt;What I can&apos;t see at a glance is how the following gives a<br/>&gt; &gt;subharmonic tetrad<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; 1-5-7, 5-7-9, 1-7-9, 1-5-9.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Here&apos;s the long-division way, applicable to both harmonic<br/>&gt; and subharmonic tetrads...<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; - Remove all factors common to each point.<br/>&gt; (there aren&apos;t any)<br/>&gt; - Multiply the remaining terms together for each point<br/>&gt; and sort to express the tetrad as a harmonic series segment.<br/>&gt; (35 45 63 315)<br/>&gt; - If the numbers are too big it may be more convenient<br/>&gt; to express each point as a ratio.<br/>&gt; (1/1 9/7 9/5 9/8)<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; For subharmonic tetrads, you can just pick one of the points,<br/>&gt; call it 1/1, and find the ratios between it and the other<br/>&gt; points in your head...<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; - The ratios for the other points all have the same numerator.<br/>&gt; It&apos;s the one factor they all have in common.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; - The denominator for a given other point is the factor in<br/>&gt; your 1/1 point that doesn&apos;t appear in that other point.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; -Carl</p><p>Thanks again Carl but I wondered if it was possible to tell if the tetrad is subharmonic just from<br/>looking at the four CPS numbers, ie 1-3-5 etc on the fly as it were, without any further<br/>calculation.
