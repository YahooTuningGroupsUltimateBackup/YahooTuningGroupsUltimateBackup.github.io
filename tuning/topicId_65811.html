So the 3-limit PA of 12-EDO is very small, which<br/>indicates that one can very easily distinguish the best<br/>approximation to 3/2 from the second-best; one will not be<br/>confused as to which note to choose.  Contrariwise, the 7-<br/>limit PA is quite high, indicating that distinguishing the best<br/>approximations to the ratios involving 7 will be harder.</p><p>That seems informative.  however, rather than taking the<br/>maximum of these ratios, wouldn&apos;t it be more informative to<br/>take their geometric mean?</p><p>Regards,<br/>Yahya</p><p>--<br/>No virus found in this outgoing message.<br/>Checked by AVG Free Edition.<br/>Version: 7.1.385 / Virus Database: 268.3.3/298 - Release Date: 30/3/06</p></div><h3>Gene Ward Smith &#x3C;genewardsmith@coolgoose.com&#x3E;</h3><span>3/31/2006 11:13:53 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;Yahya Abdal-Aziz&quot; &lt;yahya@...&gt; wrote:</p><p>&gt; That seems informative.  however, rather than taking the<br/>&gt; maximum of these ratios, wouldn&apos;t it be more informative to<br/>&gt; take their geometric mean?</p><p>It would be different; I don&apos;t see why it would be more informative.</p></div><h3>monz &#x3C;monz@tonalsoft.com&#x3E;</h3><span>3/31/2006 4:50:24 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;Yahya Abdal-Aziz&quot; &lt;yahya@...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Hi Gene,<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; On Thu, 30 Mar 2006 Gene Ward Smith wrote:<br/>&gt; &gt; --- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;Yahya Abdal-Aziz&quot; &lt;yahya@&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; Gene, three questions for you:<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; 1.
