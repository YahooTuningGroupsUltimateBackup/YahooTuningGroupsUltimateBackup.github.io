Which leaves open the question, what do you propose to use for directed intervals? In any case, if you write p/q you ARE writing a rational number, and moreover, it&apos;s considered correct when writing ratios not to equate p:q and q:p, and to consider the ratios to be equal if and only if the corresponding rational numbers are equal. This isn&apos;t very helpful, since it identifies the two, but there it is. The real reason for the distinction is historical rather than mathematical, I&apos;m afraid.</p><p>&gt; It&apos;s only a convention that an octave is written as 2/1 (up from the<br/>&gt; bottom note) rather than 1/2 (down from the top note).
