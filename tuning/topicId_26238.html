In jazz I always think of<br/>a -7b5 as a &quot;half-diminished 7th&quot;, which is a chord which<br/>&quot;belongs&quot; to minor keys, where the -7 &quot;belongs&quot; to major keys.</p><p>&gt; A -7#5 turns into a &quot;major chord over the third&quot;,<br/>&gt; or a 3 6 chord in olden days thinking.</p><p>Right again... something totally different!</p><p>Hey, Bob, thanks for all this good detailed stuff!<br/>I presented a rather simplified scenario.
