The &quot;Second&quot; would be indicated by a<br/>C to a C#.  George Ives, as quoted in Carol K. Baron&apos;s article in American<br/>Music (Fall 1992) was critical of conventional nomenclature.  This included<br/>all the usual culprits, the interval names, the written notation, the octave.<br/> George said that &quot;If&quot; one uses the notation for real sounds learned, then it<br/>could be used more effectively.  It seems to me that his son took up the<br/>challenge.  This is likely the origin for Charles&apos;s positioning of Db<br/>(George&apos;s hypothetical single space) being lower in pitch than a C# (George&apos;s<br/>hypothetical second space).  Charles decided to take his father&apos;s suggestion<br/>to heart, bringing it to its natural conclusion as important sound structures<br/>for the fertile imagination of his experimental genre.&quot;</p><p>[a selection from my upcoming book &quot;The Ives Universe&quot;]  George Ives didn&apos;t<br/>like the present day nomenclature either.</p><p>Johnny Reinhard</p></div><h3>monz &#x3C;joemonz@yahoo.com&#x3E;</h3><span>1/29/2002 10:41:17 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>&gt; From: genewardsmith &lt;<a href="mailto:genewardsmith@juno.com">genewardsmith@juno.com</a>&gt;<br/>&gt; To: &lt;<a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>&gt;<br/>&gt; Sent: Monday, January 28, 2002 11:50 AM<br/>&gt; Subject: [tuning] Re: Minor second definition sh/could include flat second<br/>[bII]<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; --- In tuning@y..., &quot;paulerlich&quot; &lt;paul@s...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt; &gt; --- In tuning@y..., &quot;genewardsmith&quot; &lt;genewardsmith@j...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; Interesting--what would<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; 1--10/9--5/4--4/3--3/2--5/3--15/8<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; be called by these various authors, I wonder?<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; I was talking about terminological distinctions in the naming of<br/>&gt; &gt; _intervals_.
