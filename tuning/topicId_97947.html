By this I mean that these other short 13-limit commas, 325/324, 364/363 and 1001/1000 seemed to work well with 676/675 and turned up when temperaments were being considered.

Adding the short 17-limit comma 833/832 and the short 13-limit comma 1001/1000 (the lummaism?) yields a rank two temperament for which 198edo could be used as a tuning, in which case the generator would be 43\198. This might seem absurdly complex, which is certainly what you&apos;d think looking at it in terms of MOS scales. However, all of those short sequences might come to our rescue in a non-MOS scale such as a MODMOS or hobbit, etc. Looking at the complexity of the various pumps involved in this temperament would be a place to start.</p></div><h3><a id=97949 href="#97949">ðŸ”—</a>Mike Battaglia &#x3C;battaglia01@...&#x3E;</h3><span>4/14/2011 8:27:04 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>On Thu, Apr 14, 2011 at 11:20 AM, genewardsmith<br/>&lt;genewardsmith@...t&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; If the &quot;length&quot; of a comma is the length of its minimal comma pump, not counting any factors of 2 or 1/2 which are irrelevant, then if we look at superparticular commas under the 17-limit with length less than 4, we get the Archipelago suspects: 325/324, 364/363, 676/675 and 1001/1000.

However, it&apos;s<br/>constructed from a different paradigm than just stacking generators<br/>one after the other. Since sometimes the MOS&apos;s of various temperaments<br/>don&apos;t really do the trick, then perhaps constructing scales in this<br/>way can be useful. These will all be MODMOS&apos;s of the temperament.</p><p>One useful property that I think that they&apos;ll have is that sometimes,<br/>if you can pin down a theorem that eludes me, I think they&apos;ll be<br/>&quot;locally periodic&quot; with respect to some subperiod. In the case of<br/>Paul&apos;s pentachordal scales, this is the case with the 4/3. It seems<br/>like Paul&apos;s scales are basically constructed this way, e.g. instead of<br/>using the true period of the scale, which is 1/2 oct, he went with the<br/>tempered 3/2 as the pseudo-period of the scale, and in so doing<br/>arrived at an omnitetrachordal scale.</p><p>Lastly, I&apos;m trying to figure out exactly what causes<br/>omnitetrachordality to occur at all. It seems like<br/>4/3-omnitetrachordal scales, like Paul&apos;s SPM scales and meantone,<br/>occur because the generator is a fourth. I can&apos;t get the same results<br/>with some MODMOS of augmented[9], though, no matter how hard I seem to<br/>try.</p><p>-Mike</p></div><h3><a id=98031 href="#98031">ðŸ”—</a>genewardsmith &#x3C;genewardsmith@...&#x3E;</h3><span>4/15/2011 8:18:55 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, Mike Battaglia &lt;battaglia01@...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; On Thu, Apr 14, 2011 at 1:37 PM, genewardsmith<br/>&gt; &lt;genewardsmith@...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; And if I could figure out how to construct one, I might think about it.
