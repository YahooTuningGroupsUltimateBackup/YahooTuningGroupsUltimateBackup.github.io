That was before I knew of anybody doing anything microtonal in nature, other than having a conceptual notion of the idea of quartertones.  The following year I designed 10TET flutes, and that science fair project got me to the international level of competition.  Then again, I didn&apos;t win anything at the international level, granted, but it happened to be in Orange County CA, where Ivor Darreg, Erv Wilson, and Glen Prior were living at the time).  John Chalmers and I were both living in Houston at the time.</p><p>I also, later on, got a 10TET fingerboard for my interchangeable fingerboard guitar.</p><p>Nevertheless, I haven&apos;t done much with &quot;Decimal Music&quot; as I called it, since then.  I&apos;m glad to see that somebody is though.  As I recall, I found it a little difficult to escape the 5x2 syndrome, not that it&apos;s at all difficult to come up with other modes, of course.</p></div><h3><a id=67385 href="#67385">ðŸ”—</a>yahya_melb &#x3C;yahya@melbpc.org.au&#x3E;</h3><span>8/4/2006 6:27:53 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Hi Gary,</p><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, Gary Morrison &lt;mr88cet@...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; John Chalmers called my attention to the fact that somebody on the &gt;<br/>list recently made a 10TET guitar.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Just FWIW, my first explorations of microtonality were back in 1977,<br/>and they involved (yes indeedie) building a 10TET guitar and bass<br/>guitar, ...
