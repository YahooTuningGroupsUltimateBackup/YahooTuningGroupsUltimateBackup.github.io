I was impressed.</p><p>To which Paul pontificated:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Nonsense.</p><p>Isn&apos;t it remarkable how Paul presents his opinions in a diplomatic and<br/>modest manner. I wish I could do that.</p><p>&gt; 8-7-5-4 in major would be a very unusual melodic outline, while a<br/>&gt; Mixolydian 4-3-1-7 is extremely familiar (listen to the Beatles&apos; &quot;Within You<br/>&gt; Without You&quot; for example). The difference has to do with the tritone&apos;s<br/>&gt; unstable function of the in the former and its stable function in the<br/>&gt; latter.</p><p>Paul, the expectation was that my students might identify the key as F as an<br/>_intellectual conclusion, having already identified the pitches. In any<br/>case, I think you are shortsighted in judging this pitch pattern to be<br/>&quot;unusual.&quot; It makes perfect sense to me in the key of F major.</p><p>BTW, one of the students had this Beatles&apos; CD in the car and we played it<br/>for comparison. The class was intrigued by the differences in tuning.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt;This, of course, would further show the F to be only _melodically related to<br/>&gt;&gt;the E and, since _no kind of F appears among the partials of C, would have<br/>&gt;&gt;no particular relationship to anything else (as far as tuning is concerned).<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Nice rationalization, but if it&apos;s all about the partials of the tonic,</p><p>It&apos;s not _all about partials of the tonic. Why read more into my points than<br/>I obviously intended? Is it your intention to seek out arguments or to<br/>understand what I am saying.</p><p>&gt; how<br/>&gt; do you explain tonic minor chords?</p><p>I&apos;m very satisfied with the description that it consists of the same<br/>intervals as the major triad, but in a different configuration.</p><p>&gt; Using the 19th partial? Time for another<br/>&gt; MIDI listening experiment? And how about fourths, sixths, and sevenths of<br/>&gt; keys?</p><p>What do these have to do with anything? For a bright guy, you seem to have a<br/>hard time extracting the essence of a simple description. You take an<br/>unimportant phrase and make an enormous deal of it. The point was simply<br/>that even if the F were 3:4 to C it would not be a member of the C&apos;s<br/>overtone series--a rather indisputable fact. Why argue with it?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt;This reminds me of our recent discussion of &quot;raised&quot; and &quot;lowered&quot;<br/>&gt;&gt;chromatics in which some writers preferred to consider F# to be lower than<br/>&gt;&gt;Gb. In the case above, there certainly wouldn&apos;t be much room for an E#<br/>&gt;&gt;between this &quot;low&quot; F and &quot;high&quot; E. (Please don&apos;t suggest that the note in<br/>&gt;&gt;question here is E# in this context. I wouldn&apos;t be able to sleep for a<br/>&gt;&gt;week.)<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I won&apos;t, but interestingly, Herman Miller recently posted a piece of his in<br/>&gt; which (given a tonic of C) he found that the &quot;F&quot; could profitably be lowered<br/>&gt; to a sort of meantone &quot;E#&quot; due to the harmonic relations in which this note<br/>&gt; participated in the piece (it didn&apos;t sound together with C at any point).</p><p>Okay. So?</p><p>After dealing with all that marginally relative discourse, let me ask<br/>whether you understand the main points of my post?--that if the key had been<br/>F, the F would likely have been tuned in a 3:4 relationship to the C, and<br/>more importantly, that the &quot;kids&quot; could hear (or sense) that it did not.</p><p>Jerry</p></div>
