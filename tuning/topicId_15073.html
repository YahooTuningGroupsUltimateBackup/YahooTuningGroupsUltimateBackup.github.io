Where you can<br/>&gt;write out lines not only in 12 tone , but in cents??</p></div><h3>Joseph Pehrson &#x3C;pehrson@pubmedia.com&#x3E;</h3><span>10/26/2000 6:33:44 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@egroups.com">tuning@egroups.com</a>, &quot;Paul H.

The easiest and cheapest (and one of the most<br/>flexible) synths is no longer manufactured, but it has incurred an<br/>almost legendary status.  In fact, perhaps some could consider it by<br/>now a &quot;classical&quot; microtonal instrument.</p><p>It is the Yamaha TX81Z.  There are several users (including myself)<br/>on this list.  Of course, the resolution (2.5 cents) is not what some<br/>people need here, but it can be tuned EASILY using the computer<br/>program SCALA.</p><p>The &quot;virtue&quot; to the TX81Z is that ANY midi note (any note number) in<br/>the ENTIRE range can be tuned to ANY frequency within the resolution<br/>mentioned above. Not every synthesizer can do this.</p><p>Last week two TX81Z&apos;s were being sold for $50 each, so there is no<br/>longer any good excuse for composers not going into microtonality<br/>because they &quot;can&apos;t afford any equipment...&quot;</p><p>An Internet search will find you a used one... which is what *I* did.<br/>I hear people talk about &quot;ebay&quot; having them as well...</p><p>___________ ____ __ _ _ _<br/>Joseph Pehrson</p></div><h3>phv40@hotmail.com</h3><span>10/26/2000 10:28:21 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>&gt; I have a quick question for you - do you know of any synthesizers,<br/>&gt; sequencers or software that lets one compose microtonally ? Where<br/>you can<br/>&gt; write out lines not only in 12 tone , but in cents??</p><p>Here&apos;s the Microtonal Synthesis site, which covers both software and<br/>hardware synthesizers and samplers:</p><p><a href="http://home.att.net/~microtonal">http://home.att.net/~microtonal</a></p><p>When you look through the charts, keep an eye on the Full Keyboard<br/>Scales column.  Especially if you want to get into scales with more<br/>than 12 notes/octave AND you want to easily switch scales.  Otherwise<br/>you will have to manually retune every note for each new scale you<br/>want and for each new patch you want to use your new scale with.  It<br/>could be quite tedious.  My Handsonic for example will let me<br/>microtune my notes for a marimba patch, but I have to do them all by<br/>hand (no tuning tables) and if I want to use the same tuning, but on<br/>a vibes patch, I have to hand-tune everything AGAIN for the new<br/>patch.</p><p>If a particular product lists one or more &quot;12 note Octave Scales&quot; but<br/>no Full Keyboard Scales, it means that product will let you program a<br/>custom tuning but you will be limited to scales with 12 notes (they<br/>don&apos;t have to be equal though, some for example use this type of<br/>feature for 12-note just intonation).  The number of scales listed<br/>under either column denote &quot;user&quot; scales.  There may also be preset<br/>scales (e.g. historical scales, Indonesian scales, etc.) that you<br/>cannot program but you can use in your patches, but these are not<br/>indicated on the charts.</p><p>Do keep in mind that the website doesn&apos;t cover everything.  There&apos;s no<br/>mention of Clavia (Nord Lead, Nord Modular, etc.) or BitHeadz (Retro<br/>AS-1, Unity, etc.), for example.</p><p>Good luck in your search,<br/>Paolo</p></div>
