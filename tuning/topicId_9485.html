His term for this practice is &quot;mixed and<br/>tempered music&quot; -- music which uses a mixture of three Greek genera<br/>(diatonic, chromatic, enharmonic), and which tempers fifths and<br/>fourths in order to obtain fully concordant thirds and sixths.</p><p>While taking meantone as the norm, and indeed recommending his<br/>archicembalo (likely tuned in a 31-note version of 1/4-comma meantone<br/>to produce a circulating and very slightly unequal division of the<br/>octave) as a standard for vocalists in finding unusual intervals,<br/>Vicentino at the same time expresses an interest in what would now be<br/>called &quot;adaptive JI,&quot; where all vertical concords (5-odd-limit<br/>intervals) are pure. This involves, as has often been discussed here,<br/>an instrument combining two meantone systems spaced 1/4-comma apart,<br/>providing pure fifths and minor thirds as well as major thirds.</p><p>In his advertisement for the arciorgano (1561), Vicentino writes about<br/>the special delights of a music where the fifth, major third, and<br/>minor third are all pure -- in other words, adaptive JI.</p><p>Incidentally, Vicentino&apos;s Italian description for the common practice<br/>is something like _musica participata e mista_ -- the adjective<br/>_participata_ referring to the tempering or narrowing of fifths on a<br/>keyboard instrument, and going back as I recall to an identical Latin<br/>term in Gaffurius (1496).</p><p>Thus while Fogliano and Vicentino agree that medieval Pythagorean<br/>tuning cannot provide the fully concordant thirds and sixths required<br/>for 16th-century practice, Fogliano turns to classic 5-limit JI (based<br/>on Ptolemy) as a solution, while Vicentino takes the usual solution of<br/>meantone temperament on keyboards as a new standard.</p><p>Interestingly, both Vicentino (1555) and Fabio Colonna (1618) delve into JI<br/>ratios in their treatises before describing their actual circulating tuning<br/>systems, both likely based on 1/4-comma meantone carried to 31 notes.</p><p>Incidentally, one controversial assertion of Vicentino is that _any_<br/>use of the melodic minor third or major third involves the<br/>introduction of the chromatic or enharmonic genus, so that the most<br/>routine 16th-century composition typically features all three genera,<br/>and thus is &quot;mixed.&quot; This is the assertion which Lusitano in 1551 (in<br/>his famous debate with Vicentino) and Zarlino in 1558 (rebutting the<br/>&quot;chromaticists&quot;) vigorously contested.</p><p>Most respectfully,</p><p>Margo Schulter<br/><a href="mailto:mschulter@value.net">mschulter@value.net</a></p></div>
