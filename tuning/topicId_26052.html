Or, as you note, possibly from more than<br/>two equal steps?</p><p>Here I would be inclined to propose the general term _evenstep_ for<br/>this concept, and to define &quot;eventone&quot; proper as more specifically<br/>referring to the derivation of the major third from two equal &quot;tones&quot;<br/>in the more conventional diatonic sense. However, the best arbiter of<br/>usage is experience and consensus, so I much regard this as an open<br/>question.</p><p>If evenstep were used for the more general category, then &quot;eventone&quot;<br/>might apply to tunings where a regular major third is formed from two<br/>equal whole-tones with a size somewhere between 10:9 and 9:8 for<br/>meantones; precisely at 9:8 for Pythagorean intonation; and somewhere<br/>between 9:8 and 8:7 for neo-Gothic temperaments.</p><p>As I have remarked earlier, whether or not a tuning is regarded as an<br/>eventone -- or &quot;equitone&quot; in my preceding usage -- depends not only on<br/>its regular structure, but on the musical context.</p><p>For example, 22-tET is to me an eventone with two whole-tones of 4/22<br/>octave (~218.18 cents) forming a regular major third of 8/22 octave<br/>(~436.36 cents). Here the major third is very close to a pure 9:7, and<br/>the whole-tone accordingly close to the mean of 9:8 and 8:7.</p><p>However, if one uses 22-tET for Paul Erlich&apos;s decatonic system based<br/>on stable tetrads of 4:5:6:7, then the usual major third at 7/22<br/>octave (near 5:4) is not formed from two equal whole-tones, and the<br/>tuning is not an &quot;eventone&quot; in this stylistic context.</p><p>The same remark might apply to what I tend to view as the larger<br/>category of evenstep tunings: here, again, a tuning might be open to<br/>different interpretations of a given interval category based on style,<br/>which might be derived from either equal or unequal steps depending on<br/>the context.</p><p>Maybe one advantage of having an &quot;evenstep&quot; concept is that it might<br/>avoid the specific diatonic implications of &quot;tone&quot; and suggest<br/>application to a wide range of systems.</p><p>To sum up my tentative scheme, inviting much further dialogue:</p><p>          MEANTONE: A tuning where major thirds approximating<br/>                    a ratio of 5:4 are formed from two equal<br/>                    whole-tones, not too far in size from the<br/>                    mean of 10:9 and 9:8.</p><p>          EVENTONE: A tuning where major thirds of some desired<br/>                    size (e.g. 5:4, 81:64, 14:11, 9:7) are<br/>                    derived from two equal whole-tones, with<br/>                    some implication of a regular diatonic<br/>                    structure (e.g. Easley Blackwood).</p><p>          EVENSTEP: Any tuning where an interval of interest<br/>                    is derived from two (or more?) equal steps,<br/>                    e.g. a 15-tET minor third at 320 cents from<br/>                    two equal steps of 160 cents each.</p><p>Most appreciatively,</p><p>Margo Schulter<br/><a href="mailto:mschulter@value.net">mschulter@value.net</a></p></div>
