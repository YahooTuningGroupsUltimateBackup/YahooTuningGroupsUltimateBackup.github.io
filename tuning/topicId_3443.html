Future webpage.)</p><p>This would now be even less surprising to me, if one considers<br/>the idea that perhaps a preference for 5-limit singing was<br/>a common trait among all the Germanic peoples when they were<br/>a more homogenous group (i.e., before about 300 AD), and<br/>that it disappeared in proportion to the intermingling and<br/>dispersion of the various German nations after the invasions.</p><p>I say this on analogy with the idea that the &apos;purest&apos; Germanic<br/>traits to be found in Europe around 1000 would have been manifested<br/>in Scandinavia, as evidenced by a perusal of linguistic and<br/>literary records from Tacitus to _Beowulf_.</p><p>If this is true, then apparently that preference got diluted<br/>as the Franks slowly became truly Christianized, but of course<br/>it would have left its mark on the Gallican Rite and the<br/>music associated with it, which in turn affected all the<br/>liturgical music of western Europe.</p><p>The comments on Jacobus of Liege are also very interesting.</p><p>[Margo Schulter, TD 209.19]<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Here I do not wish to make invidious comparisons, since each<br/>&gt; theory nicely fits the style of a beautiful music. However,<br/>&gt; I do wish to counteract the common view of &quot;progress&quot; in which<br/>&gt; the 18th-century harmonic system becomes a kind of directive<br/>&gt; goal for all previous practice and theory. The 3-limit harmony<br/>&gt; of the 13th century is very beautiful, and very non-18th-century.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Monz raises the question as to whether medieval theorists<br/>&gt; described Pythagorean tuning because they did not have available<br/>&gt; the mathematics to describe anything else, theory&apos;s tools<br/>&gt; &quot;improving&quot; between 1300 and 1500.</p><p>I&apos;m not sure if the accusation I perceive here was intended<br/>or just a result of the juxtaposition of those two paragraphs.</p><p>I certainly do believe that music theory&apos;s tools &apos;improved&apos;<br/>between 1300 and 1500, as mathematical knowledge increased<br/>and the printing press was invented, etc.</p><p>However, I want to make it clear that *I* do *not* hold the view<br/>that &apos;the 18th-century harmonic system becomes a kind of directive<br/>goal for all previous practice and theory&apos;.</p><p>My view is simply that all kinds of tunings have always been<br/>available to people, and they have been aware of this to varying<br/>degrees thru-out history, which has affected both the compositions<br/>and the theory which resulted.</p><p>If there&apos;s any new understanding I&apos;m gaining from the debate<br/>here between you, myself, Paul, and the others, it&apos;s that&apos;s<br/>we must be very cautious about making *any* kind of blanket<br/>statement about the intonation of this old music, and instead<br/>try to investigate the *probabilities* of various different<br/>tunings based on things like geography, ethnicity, etc.,<br/>in medieval Europe.</p><p>What I see ultimately emerging from this (hopefully) is a<br/>kaleidoscopic panoply of tunings employed for the medieval<br/>repertoire, giving us, upon hearing performances using these<br/>varied tunings, a new insight into the nature of the medieval<br/>European character(s), and thus perhaps shedding new light on<br/>one of the dimmest periods of a history that matters to a number<br/>of us.</p><p>&apos;Respectfully&apos;,</p><p>-monz</p><p>Joseph L.
