However it probably would not<br/>initially be for the PC platform, but plans are to make it easily portable.</p><p>But it is an interesting suggestion for scala to be enhanced to allow MIDI<br/>knob inputs to set a series of pitches in the way you describe.</p><p>On the other hand, if you have a synth that allows individual notes to be<br/>tunes with individual messages, you could just program a generalized<br/>controller such as a PEAVEY PC1600 to send out the requisite messages.  But<br/>I don&apos;t yet know the details of how current synths that allow a single<br/>octave to be tuned (and automatically repeated) accomplish this, i.e.<br/>whether a message for tuning an individual note as opposed to the whole<br/>octave at once.</p><p>I think this is a great idea.</p><p>I have been thinking about having a single control that squeezes or<br/>stretches the intervals near a certain part of the octave, and another<br/>control that changes what part of the octave is the center of the<br/>squeeze/stretch.  Your idea is the ultimate generalization of that kind of<br/>flexibility.  But there are many other variations such as setting generators<br/>dynamically that might also be valuable and simpler to tweak while in the<br/>middle of playing.</p><p>-Kurt</p></div>
