This remark was part of a<br/>dialogue on modality, tonality, and tuning in 17th-century music; and<br/>it has ultimately proved catalytic in moving me to explore unequal<br/>circulating neo-Gothic temperaments, whether appropriately called<br/>&quot;well-temperaments&quot; or something else.</p><p>This article is indeed warmly dedicated to Paul as a scholar,<br/>musician, mathematician, theorist, and educator.</p><p>-------------------------------------<br/>1. Introduction: a tuning takes shape<br/>-------------------------------------</p><p>Upon seeing Paul Erlich&apos;s recent articles on well-temperaments of the<br/>conventional kind, I was moved to ask, &quot;What about neo-Gothic<br/>well-temperaments? Isn&apos;t time that I explored this aspect of<br/>neo-medieval intonation?&quot;</p><p>Quickly I decided that while conventional 5-limit well-temperaments<br/>have 12 notes, a 17-note format would seem much friendlier for a<br/>neo-Gothic well-temperament. I may write an article explaining this<br/>decision in more detail, but for now let&apos;s consider the attractiveness<br/>of 17 as a tuning size.</p><p>In a circulating 17-note tuning, we must disperse the quantity by<br/>which 17 pure 3:2 fifths would fall short of ten pure 2:1 octaves --<br/>about 66.76 cents.[1] Thus we must temper our fifths by an average of<br/>about 3.93 cents in the _wide_ direction.</p><p>If we temper each fifth by this identical amount, then we have the<br/>special case of 17-tone equal temperament or (17-tet). Since 17-tet is<br/>squarely in &quot;the middle of the road&quot; within the spectrum of neo-Gothic<br/>regular tunings or hypermeantones ranging from Pythagorean JI (or<br/>53-tet) to around 22-tet or 27-tet, it offers a very friendly point of<br/>departure for unequal well-temperaments.</p><p>Very happily, I quickly came upon a pleasant way to allocate that<br/>66.76 cents: why not temper the 11 &quot;regular&quot; fifths (Eb-G#) so as to<br/>produce pure 14:11 major thirds, and the other six more remote or<br/>&quot;supplementary&quot; fifths (Gb-Eb, G#-A#) so as to obtain pure 9:7 major<br/>thirds at the far side of the tuning circle?</p><p>In other words, my ideal was to tune 11 fifths in what I call a pure<br/>14:11 hypermeantone (fifths ~2.421 cents wider than pure), and the<br/>other six fifths in a pure 9:7 hypermeantone (fifths ~6.816 cents<br/>wider than pure). As it turned out, this scheme would exceed the total<br/>tuning &quot;budget&quot; of 66.76 cents by only around 0.773 cents.</p><p>An obvious and pleasant solution is to temper five of the six more<br/>remote fifths as in a pure 9:7 hypermeantone, as intended, and to<br/>temper the sixth &quot;odd&quot; fifth by this amount less the adjustment of<br/>~0.773 cents, or ~6.043 cents, thus &quot;balancing the budget&quot; and<br/>making the tuning cycle come out to precisely 10 octaves.</p><p>My goal was to maximize the number of just intervals -- just intervals<br/>with a neo-Gothic flavor, of course. We get eight pure 14:11 major<br/>thirds in the nearer portion of the circle -- actually a complete<br/>12-note hypermeantone tuning of Eb-G# in its own right, then ranging<br/>through intermediate sizes until we reach two pure 9:7 major thirds at<br/>the far side of the circle. Another major third in this remote region<br/>is only ~0.773 cents from a pure 9:7, being formed from a chain of<br/>three 9:7 hypermeantone fifths plus the slightly narrower &quot;odd&quot; fifth<br/>balancing out the circle.</p><p>Now just one decision remained: where to put that 17th odd fifth? At<br/>first blush, I considered placing it at the most remote fifth of the<br/>circle A#-Gb, where sharp and flat extremes meet in a kind of<br/>intonational International Date Line. However, this would break the<br/>chain of 9:7 hypermeantone fifths needed to get some pure 9:7 major<br/>thirds. The following diagram, with &quot;S&quot; showing a &quot;supplementary&quot; 9:7<br/>hypermeantone fifth and &quot;O&quot; the odd fifth, may help show my dilemma:</p><p>            ... G# - D# - A# - Gb - Db - Ab - Eb ...<br/>                   S    S    O    S    S    S</p><p>To get a pure 9:7, we need a chain of four consecutive &quot;S&quot; fifths.<br/>Fortunately, a ready solution was at hand: why not place the odd fifth<br/>at Ab-Eb -- a traditional location in a 12-note meantone tuning for<br/>the &quot;odd&quot; or &quot;Wolf&quot; fifth (i.e. G#-Eb)? Also, since this odd 17th<br/>fifth is actually intermediate in size between the 14:11 and 9:7<br/>hypermeantone fifths, wouldn&apos;t placing it at an intermediate point in<br/>the circle be in line with &quot;the conventions of well-temperament&quot;?</p><p>At any rate, the Ab-Eb solution nicely restores an unbroken chain of<br/>five &quot;S&quot; fifths -- producing two pure 9:7 thirds (G#-Db, D#-Ab) as<br/>intended:</p><p>            ... G# - D# - A# - Gb - Db - Ab - Eb ...<br/>                   S    S    S    S    S    O</p><p>Thus our full 17-note tuning circle looks like this, with approximate<br/>sizes in cents shown for each fifth, and the &quot;International Date Line&quot;<br/>at A#-Gb appearing at the bottom of the diagram:</p><p>                                  D<br/>                         704.377     704.377<br/>                        G                   A<br/>                704.377                       704.377<br/>                C                                    E<br/>          704.377                                      704.377<br/>        F                                                     B<br/>  704.377                                                       704.377<br/>Bb                                                                    F#<br/>  704.377                                                       704.377<br/>        Eb                                                    C#<br/>          707.998                                        704.377<br/>               Ab                                      G#<br/>              708.771                             708.771<br/>                     Db                        D#<br/>                       708.771           708.771<br/>                            Gb         A#<br/>                               708.771</p><p>Now the tuning itself was complete, and it was time to explore the<br/>ramifications.</p><p>Charting out the various categories and sizes of intervals, I came<br/>upon the serendipitous discovery that the tuning includes another just<br/>interval: a pure 11:9 third at the augmented second Db-E. Also, I was<br/>delighted to find a relationship involving the ratio -- shall I call<br/>it a schisma? -- of 2058:2057.</p><p>Having considered the theory, it was time for some musical practice:<br/>tuning up the temperament and trying it out with some 13th-14th<br/>century compositions, and some neo-Gothic improvisations in similar<br/>styles.</p><p>Using a mild &quot;positive organ&quot; timbre, I found that the pure 14:11<br/>major thirds were &quot;sunny&quot; and beautiful, resolving splendidly to<br/>stable sonorities with fifths. At the keyboard, as on paper, there<br/>were striking contrasts as one journeyed about the territory of the<br/>more remote accidentals and cadences. The neutral or &quot;neutral-like&quot;<br/>thirds and sixths of this region -- actually diminished fourths or<br/>augmented seconds -- can have a &quot;mysterious&quot; flavor, like similar<br/>intervals in 17-tet.</p><p>Yesterday a visiting friend heard the tuning, and offered some<br/>fascinating reactions which I hope to share in another article.<br/>For the moment, I&apos;ll just note that she when she heard the &quot;neutral&quot;<br/>17-tet-like intervals, she described them as &quot;mysterious&quot; -- and said<br/>that the tuning generally had for her a &quot;dark&quot; quality like &quot;a forest<br/>in Northern Europe.&quot; (Actually, as I reread this early on Monday, the<br/>visit took place &quot;the day before yesterday,&quot; Saturday.)</p><p>In the remainder of this first presentation, I&apos;ll seek to survey a few<br/>features of the tuning and document some of its &quot;vital stastics.&quot;<br/>Section 2 offers an overview including a keyboard chart and a sample<br/>of a few sonorities and cadences.</p><p>Within the next day or two I hope to post a list of interval<br/>categories and sizes in the tuning.</p><p>----------------------------------------------------<br/>2.

Another approach to place the five flats on one<br/>manual and the five sharps on the other.[2]</p><p>If we take the first approach, then our manual with the regular<br/>accidentals will offer a full 12-note chromatic scale (Eb-G#) in our<br/>hypermeantone with pure 14:11 major thirds.[3] Note that we can<br/>incorporate this beautiful 12-note tuning, complete and unaltered,<br/>into our 17-note tuning circle. This situation may suggest the<br/>creative possibilities of 17-note neo-Gothic well-temperaments, and<br/>also their forgiving nature when compared with the more earnest<br/>constraints typically imposed by historical 12-note well-temperaments.</p><p>On our second manual, the five supplementary accidentals also define a<br/>tuning in themselves: a pentatonic scale in a hypermeantone with pure<br/>9:7 major thirds. Trying this scale, e.g. Db-D#-Gb-Ab-A#, we find that<br/>the two &quot;minor thirds&quot; actually are spelled as doubly augmented primes<br/>(Db-D#, Ab-A#), while &quot;major seconds&quot; occur at the doubly diminished<br/>fourths D#-Gb and A#-Db as well as the expected Gb-Ab.[4]</p><p>As we move from the usual Eb-G# range to more remote cadential centers<br/>and modal transpositions, intervals and progressions take on<br/>intriguingly different shadings and colors, something I would like to<br/>describe more fully in another article. For now, let us consider a few<br/>examples of regular, alternative, and &quot;remote&quot; sonorities and cadences.</p><p>In the &quot;regular&quot; 12-note hypermeantone range, the mildly unstable<br/>Gothic _quinta fissa_ or split fifth sonority consists of an outer<br/>fifth divided into a pure 14:11 major third (~417.51 cents) and a<br/>minor third at about 286.87 cents, or ~2.34 cents narrower than<br/>13:11.</p><p>This kind of sonority could be interpreted either as a tempered<br/>version of 22:28:33 or 28:33:42, with 14:11 and 33:28 thirds making up<br/>a pure 3:2 fifth; or as a tempering of 121:143:181 or 121:154:181,<br/>with a pure 14:11 major third and 13:11 minor third joined to form a<br/>fifth at 196:121, or about 706.72 cents (~4.76 cents wider than pure).</p><p>In the second interpretation of a sonority combining 14:11 and 13:11,<br/>where the fifth would be &quot;naturally tempered&quot; as it were, we are in<br/>effect slightly tempering the 13:11 but actually making the fifth<br/>closer to a pure 3:2 (~2.42 cents wide) than in the &quot;just&quot; tuning.</p><p>Within our regular Eb-G# hypermeantone range, we also have four<br/>diminished fourths or alternate major thirds at 121:98 or ~364.98<br/>cents, smaller than a pure 21:17 by a schisma of 2058:2057, or about<br/>0.84 cents. These thirds have a pleasing &quot;submajor&quot; or &quot;subditonal&quot;<br/>quality, while augmented seconds or alternate minor thirds in this<br/>regular 12-note range at ~339.39 cents, or ~3.26 cents wider than<br/>17:14, may have a &quot;superminor&quot; or &quot;supersemiditonal&quot; quality. An<br/>alternative split fifth sonority combining these two thirds might be<br/>taken as an approximation of 14:17:21 or 34:42:51.</p><p>Comparing standard cadential resolutions of regular and alternate<br/>split fifth sonorities within the 12-note Eb-G# range may also show<br/>the contrast between diatonic and chromatic semitones. Here C4 is<br/>middle C, with higher note numbers for higher octaves; numbers in<br/>parentheses show vertical intervals between adjacent voices, and<br/>signed numbers show melodic intervals either ascending (positive) or<br/>descending (negative):</p><p>  B3  --  +78.1 -- C4          Bb3 -- +130.6 -- B3<br/>(417.5)         (704.4)      (365.0)         (704.4)<br/>  G3  -- -208.8 -- F3          F#3 -- -208.8 -- E3<br/>(286.9)           (0.0)      (339.4)           (0.0)<br/>  E3  --  +78.1 -- F3          Eb3 -- +130.6 -- E3</p><p>The difference in color between these two versions of the common<br/>resolution in which a minor third contracts to a unison while a major<br/>third expands to a fifth (m3-1 + M3-5) results not only from the<br/>varying sizes of the unstable thirds but also from the contrast<br/>between diatonic semitones (~78.12 cents) in the usual version and<br/>chromatic semitones (~130.64 cents) in the alternate one. The<br/>contrast becomes yet greater as we venture into more remote<br/>accidentals and cadential transpositions.</p><p>The octave complement of the diminished fourth is an augmented fifth<br/>(e.g. F3-C#4) or alternative minor sixth at 196:121 or ~835.02 cents,<br/>rather close to the Golden Ratio or Phi at ~1.61803398875 (~833.09<br/>cents).</p><p>Here are two possible resolution of a sonority involving this interval<br/>in combination with the augmented second, both variants on a common<br/>13th-century cadence in which minor sixth expands to octave and minor<br/>third to fifth (m6-8 + m3-5), with the numbers in parenthesis this<br/>time showing vertical intervals between the lower and outer pairs of<br/>voices. The second example introduces some more remote accidentals:</p><p>  C#4 -- +156.2 -- Eb4           C#4 -- +213.1 -- D#4<br/>(835.0)         (1200.0)       (835.0)         (1200.0)<br/>  G#3 -- +156.2 -- Bb3           G#3 -- +217.5 -- A#3<br/>(339.4)          (704.4)       (339.4)          (708.8)<br/>  F3  -- -208.8 -- Eb3           F3  -- -151.8 -- D#3</p><p>In the first progression, within the usual 12-note range, the lower<br/>voice descends by a major second while the upper voices ascend in<br/>parallel fourths by the melodic interval of a diminished third,<br/>something like 3/4-tone. In the second, the lower voice descends by a<br/>similar diminished third while the upper voices ascend together in<br/>fourths by major seconds. In the latter progression, leading us into<br/>the more remote portion of the tuning circle, note how major seconds<br/>and fifths grow larger, and diminished thirds smaller.</p><p>A final example may demonstrate the dramatic contrasts offered by a<br/>17-tone well-temperament; here the basic progression is the favorite<br/>14th-century cadence of major sixth to octave and major third to fifth<br/>(M6-8 + M3-5):</p><p>  C#4 --  +78.1 -- D4              Db4  -- +138.7 -- D4<br/>(913.1)         (1200.0)         (852.6)          (1200.0)<br/>  G#3 --  +78.1 -- A3              Ab3  -- +134.3 -- A3<br/>(417.5)          (704.4)         (361.4)           (704.4)<br/>  E3  -- -208.8 -- D3              E3   -- -208.8 -- D3</p><p>In the second example, the usual major sixth E-C# is replaced by the<br/>remote diminished seventh E3-Db4 at a pure 18:11, and the usual major<br/>third E-G# by the diminished fourth E3-Ab3 in a transitional region of<br/>the tuning circle where this interval shades from the usual ~21:17<br/>toward 16:13. The very compact 78-cent diatonic semitones of the first<br/>progression are replaced by chromatic semitones further enlarged by<br/>the well-temperament process: Db-D exceeds C#-D by a full 60 cents.</p><p>This kind of 17-note circulating tuning might be compared to a fabric<br/>or quilt of many threads: it combines a generous set of just intervals<br/>with the color contrasts of extended (hyper)meantone and of more<br/>traditional well-temperaments. We might add that the first 12 notes in<br/>14:11 hypermeantone are almost identical to 46-tet (see also Note 3<br/>below), while the five remote accidentals in 9:7 hypermeantone are<br/>very close to 22-tet.</p><p>-----<br/>Notes<br/>-----</p><p>1. This quantity of ~66.76 cents, or 134217728:129140163, is the<br/>&quot;supercompact&quot; semitone or &quot;sublimma&quot; of Xeno-Gothic music based on a<br/>24-note Pythagorean tuning (17 fifths down, e.g. G#-Bbb), equal to a<br/>usual diatonic semitone or limma of 256:243 (~90.22 cents) less a<br/>Pythagorean comma of 531441:524288 (~23.46 cents).</p><p>2.  The arrangement of the usual accidentals from Eb to G# in one<br/>&quot;rank&quot; or tier, and of the less common accidentals in another, follows<br/>a 16th-century practice illustrated by Nicola Vicentino&apos;s archicembalo<br/>(1555). The arrangement with five flats on one keyboard and five<br/>sharps on the other might at least conceptually have a certain<br/>affinity to the 17-note Pythagoreah monochord divisions of Prosdocimus<br/>de Beldemandis (1413) and Ugolino of Orvieto (c. 1430-1440?). These<br/>theorists first present separate chromatic monochords with five flats<br/>or five sharps, showing how the two monochords must be combined into a<br/>17-note monochord in order to avoid certain cadential inconsistencies.<br/>While specifically describes how the &quot;intelligent organist&quot; could take<br/>advantage of such a tuning, Ugolino does not actually address the<br/>question of a keyboard arrangement. My first impression is that the<br/>Eb-G#/other scheme may be more practical if one only occasionally uses<br/>the &quot;other&quot; accidentals, while the flats/sharps scheme may facilitate<br/>neo-Gothic styles where these other accidentals are used with some<br/>frequency.</p><p>3. if extended to 46 notes, this tuning would provide a circulating or<br/>&quot;virtually closed&quot; temperament almost identical to 46-tet. The last<br/>fifth would be made about 1.34 cents narrower than the others (~703.04<br/>cents, ~1.08 cents wider than pure) to achieve a cycle of 46 fifths<br/>precisely equal to 27 octaves.</p><p>4. Another pentatonic scale in 9:7 hypermeantone is defined by the<br/>chain of fifths G#-D#-A#-Gb-Db, e.g. Db-D#-Gb-G#-A# (equivalent to<br/>m3-M2-m3-M2-M2). In this specific mode, incidentally, there is no<br/>fifth above the chosen center Db, but some world polyphonies actually<br/>prefer fourths as the main concords, a preference exhibited in some<br/>Western European polyphony of the 9th-11th centuries (e.g. Guido<br/>d&apos;Arezzo). Thus the fourth Db-Gb, or a three-voice sonority with the<br/>fourth below and fifth above such as Db3-Gb-Db4, could serve as a<br/>concord of repose in this mode.</p><p>Most respectfully,</p><p>Margo Schulter<br/><a href="mailto:mschulter@value.net">mschulter@value.net</a></p></div>
