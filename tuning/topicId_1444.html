I believe that this &apos;history of finity<br/>&gt;in tuning&apos; (which, I now realize, is what my book(s?) attempts<br/>&gt;to be) can enrich our knowledge of many other aspects of our<br/>&gt;lives and histories, especially ancient religious beliefs,<br/>&gt;possibly even extending to modern scientific theories about<br/>&gt;the universe.</p><p>The Hindu system of 22 srutis, in its common JI form is essentially a Fokker<br/>periodicity block, but not one of the good ones I&apos;m looking for. Since this<br/>is a 5-limit system, we need two unison vectors. The first one is the<br/>diaschisma, ratio 2048/2025 or 3^-4 * 5^-2, as we&apos;ve discussed before,<br/>there&apos;s evidence that the same pitch (sruti #2) functioned as 135/128 and as<br/>16/15 (or in ma-grama, as 45/32 and as 64/45). That&apos;s about 19.6 cents. The<br/>other unison vector is large: the difference between sruti #1 in the two<br/>gramas, 3^-9 * 5 or 68.7 cents. So the Fokker matrix is</p><p>    -5     3<br/>    -9     1</p><p>The inverse of this matrix is</p><p>     1/22        -3/22<br/>     9/22        -5/22</p><p>If we transform the set of lattice points with this matrix, we can define a<br/>periodicity block within any 1 X 1 square of the transformed lattice. The<br/>usual approach is to use the &quot;unit square&quot; from the origin to (1,1), but of<br/>course we are free to translate this square wherever we want since the<br/>result will still tile the plane with the unison vectors as generators. So<br/>let us choose the square where the position along each dimension is greater<br/>than -1/2 and less than or equal to 1/2, so the origin will serve as a<br/>central note rather than a corner. Taking the resulting 22 points</p><p>    -5/11         1/11<br/>    -9/22         2/11<br/>    -4/11         3/11<br/>    -7/22         4/11<br/>    -3/11         5/11<br/>    -5/22        -5/11<br/>    -2/11        -4/11<br/>    -3/22        -3/11<br/>    -1/11        -2/11<br/>    -1/22        -1/11<br/>      0            0<br/>     1/22         1/11<br/>     1/11         2/11<br/>     3/22         3/11<br/>     2/11         4/11<br/>     5/22         5/11<br/>     3/11        -5/11<br/>     7/22        -4/11<br/>     4/11        -3/11<br/>     9/22        -2/11<br/>     5/11        -1/11<br/>     1/2           0</p><p>and transforming them back to the lattice (using the original Fokker<br/>matrix), we get</p><p>          -1          -1         112<br/>           0          -1         814<br/>           1          -1         316<br/>           2          -1        1018<br/>           3          -1         520<br/>          -5           0          90<br/>          -4           0         792<br/>          -3           0         294<br/>          -2           0         996<br/>          -1           0         498<br/>           0           0           0<br/>           1           0         702<br/>           2           0         204<br/>           3           0         906<br/>           4           0         408<br/>           5           0        1110<br/>          -3           1         680<br/>          -2           1         182<br/>          -1           1         884<br/>           0           1         386<br/>           1           1        1088<br/>           2           1         590</p><p>in lattice form:</p><p>              680---182---884---386---1088--590<br/>              / \   / \   / \   / \   / \   / \<br/>             /   \ /   \ /   \ /   \ /   \ /   \<br/>90---792---294---996---498----0----702---204---906---408---1110<br/>                   \   / \   / \   / \   / \   /<br/>                    \ /   \ /   \ /   \ /   \ /<br/>                    112---814---316---1018--520</p><p>Now of course all the properties of the block are preserved if we transpose<br/>one (or more) note(s) by one of the unison vectors used to create the block.<br/>This corresponds to distorting the edges of the block in parallel as I&apos;ve<br/>discussed before.

So this isn&apos;t<br/>one of the blocks I&apos;m looking for.</p><p>By the way, this process of transposing notes by unison vectors can in<br/>general affect the analysis of whether the block is of the &apos;good&apos; type or<br/>not, as can the translation of the unit square mentioned earlier. Also one<br/>could consider the diagonals of the block as representing unisons as well as<br/>the edges.
