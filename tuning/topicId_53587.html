The most famous example is<br/>&gt; meantone temperament, whose various varieties are solutions to the<br/>&gt; problem of best tempering out the syntonic comma (81:80) without<br/>&gt; regard to any other commas vanishing. Schismic (or schismatic)<br/>&gt; temperament is another classic example (q.v. Helmholtz, Groven, and<br/>&gt; Sabat-Garibaldi), while recently we have seen the discovery and<br/>&gt; rediscovery of quite a few other such schemes, such as Miracle,<br/>&gt; Hanson, and the &quot;Pajara&quot; system which forms the underpinning for my<br/>&gt; paper on the decatonic scales.</p><p>Since &quot;middle path&quot; doesn&apos;t sound particularly technical, and since<br/>all of the times I have seen it used it seemed to apply to &quot;third<br/>world&quot; tunings (not a good name, of course, because of its political<br/>and economic connotations), I assumed that this is how you were using<br/>it, and I didn&apos;t see anything in the above examples that would have<br/>given me a clue that I was mistaken.  My apologies.</p><p>&gt; Like JI and ETs, middle path tunings are &quot;regular&quot; -- a given<br/>&gt; consonance is represented the same way no matter where it appears<br/>in<br/>&gt; the tuning system. It seems to me that if a property such<br/>&gt; as &quot;regularity&quot; is possessed by both JI and the ETs, then it ought<br/>to<br/>&gt; be possessed by any &quot;middle path&quot; between them.</p><p>Yes, that seems logical.  However, I could also argue that, since<br/>well-temperament has historical importance in the transition from<br/>meantone temperament to 12-ET, it therefore occupies a middle-ground<br/>between the two and could thereby be included in the broader middle<br/>ground (or middle path) between 5-limit JI and 12-ET.</p><p>&gt; My XH18 paper is a complete survey of 5- and 7-limit, two-<br/>dimensional<br/>&gt; (like those mentioned above) &quot;middle path&quot; systems within a certain<br/>&gt; boundary on error and complexity. In fact, the title of the paper<br/>is<br/>&gt; _The Middle Path. Part 1: Fifty Floragrams_.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; It seems that you are now putting forth a different definition<br/>&gt; of &quot;middle path&quot;, similar to the &quot;well-temperament&quot; concept, which<br/>&gt; refers to closed systems (while mine refers to open systems) and<br/>&gt; irregular systems (while mine refers to closed [s/b regular]<br/>systems).</p><p>About my well-temperaments you are absolutely correct.  However, my<br/>high-tolerance temperament sets are basically multiple chains of<br/>uniformly tempered fifths, hence are not really irregular, at least<br/>from a philosophical standpoint, and they are closed sets only as a<br/>matter of convenience, for the same sense that Blackjack or Canasta<br/>might be considered closed sets.  You could conceive of the 29-tone<br/>high-tolerance temperament as starting with chains of fifths<br/>including the tones 1/1, 5/4, 7/4, 11/8, and 13/8, then tempering the<br/>fifths so that 7/4, 11/8, and 13/8 are all in the same chain.  Fifths<br/>perceived to be &quot;irregular&quot; are actually intervals between tones in<br/>different chains, and otonal ogdoads in 6 keys (B-flat through A)<br/>require 28 tones.  Yes, there is one exception: an additional tone (E-<br/>flat) is required to fill a hole in the 29-tone mapping, but even<br/>that could be interpreted as 19/16 of C in a one-tone chain (hey, cut<br/>me a little slack here, huh?).</p><p>In the other HTT sets there are two more chains of fifths that<br/>include the tones 65/64 and 91/64, giving 9-limit otonalities on<br/>(approximated) ratios of 11 and 13.  Ratios of 11 and 13 may be<br/>approximated on those roots using tones from the 1/1 chain, which is<br/>tantamount to substituting tempered 22:27:32 intervals for 9:11:13.</p><p>While the preceding 2 paragraphs may seem to be a bit of a<br/>digression, I was hoping to make 2 points:</p><p>1) Not all of my tunings that you were excluding from the &quot;middle<br/>path&quot; category are well-temperaments;<br/>2) Like JI vs. temperament or rational vs. irrational, a practical<br/>distinction between regular vs. irregular or open vs. closed may not<br/>always be as clear as we expected.</p><p>&gt; I can<br/>&gt; certainly see how a JI periodicity block might be created, then<br/>&gt; tempered first near the edges, and finally tempered uniformly<br/>&gt; everywhere to yield an ET, such that the middle step would be a<br/>well-<br/>&gt; temperament. However, I feel this unfairly omits the whole universe<br/>&gt; of possibilities where fewer of the periodicity blocks&apos; unison<br/>&gt; vectors are tempered out, and which are thus also in the &quot;middle&quot;<br/>&gt; between JI and ETs.</p><p>As I said above, my impression was that the term &quot;middle path&quot; would<br/>not include any tuning not covered by the two opposite extremes, JI<br/>and ET (or as I would prefer, EDO).</p><p>&gt; While I certainly respect your thinking process, and the musical<br/>&gt; value of well-tempered systems is unquestionable, I wonder if we&apos;re<br/>&gt; heading toward a terminological nightmare here.</p><p>Well, &quot;middle path&quot; is your term, so I think I&apos;m obligated to abide<br/>by whatever definition you choose for it.  My problem is that you<br/>have used the term to exclude certain tunings that, given a similar<br/>number of tones, offer better intonation than EDO&apos;s and more<br/>modulation than JI, thereby offering a practical middle-ground<br/>between the two.</p><p>Hmmm, maybe I should call this broader category the &quot;middle-ground&quot;,<br/>to include tunings both on and off the &quot;middle path&quot;.  (I always<br/>fancied most of my tunings as being off the beaten path, anyway.  ;-)</p><p>Question: would all regular middle-ground tunings then be middle-path?</p><p>--George</p></div><h3><a id=53588 href="#53588">ðŸ”—</a>wallyesterpaulrus &#x3C;paul@stretch-music.com&#x3E;</h3><span>6/14/2004 2:56:33 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;George D.

ET should refer to<br/>&gt; temperament, a tempering of JI, in particular that of a sort which<br/>&gt; leads to a finite number of equally-spaced tones. 24-equal, for<br/>&gt; example, would be awkward to derive as an ET, unless you began with<br/>&gt; the restriction that only primes 3, 11, and perhaps 13 would figure<br/>&gt; into your initial JI system. 24-equal, at least in the West, is<br/>&gt; usually best considered an EDO. Not so for 12-equal.</p><p>Then should we call a non-octave equal spacing of tones that does not<br/>approximate JI particularly well an ET, and, if not, then what name<br/>should we use and where do we put the boundary between the two?  ;-)</p><p>I would much prefer to make the two philosophical extremes JI and<br/>EDO&apos;s rather than JI and ET&apos;s, because the former is unambiguous.</p><p>&gt; &gt; &gt; While I certainly respect your thinking process, and the<br/>musical<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; value of well-tempered systems is unquestionable, I wonder if<br/>we&apos;re<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; heading toward a terminological nightmare here.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; Well, &quot;middle path&quot; is your term, so I think I&apos;m obligated to<br/>abide<br/>&gt; &gt; by whatever definition you choose for it.  My problem is that you<br/>&gt; &gt; have used the term to exclude certain tunings that, given a<br/>similar<br/>&gt; &gt; number of tones, offer better intonation than EDO&apos;s and more<br/>&gt; &gt; modulation than JI, thereby offering a practical middle-ground<br/>&gt; &gt; between the two.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; Hmmm, maybe I should call this broader category the &quot;middle-<br/>ground&quot;,<br/>&gt; &gt; to include tunings both on and off the &quot;middle path&quot;.  (I always<br/>&gt; &gt; fancied most of my tunings as being off the beaten path,<br/>anyway.  ;-)<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Sounds good to me.</p><p>Agreed, then -- nightmare averted!</p><p>&gt; &gt; Question: would all regular middle-ground tunings then be middle-<br/>&gt; &gt;path?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Shoot me an example to test.</p><p>I didn&apos;t have anything particular in mind.  I just wondered if you<br/>could think of an example for which that would not hold true.</p><p>What about a linear tuning that doesn&apos;t approximate JI well?  Or if I<br/>considered JI and EDO&apos;s to be the two extremes between which there<br/>exists a middle ground (while you keep JI vs. ET&apos;s): then non-octave<br/>ET&apos;s would be regular middle-ground tunings that are not middle-<br/>path.  (Hmmm, that could get confusing.)</p><p>--George</p></div><h3><a id=53600 href="#53600">ðŸ”—</a>George D.
