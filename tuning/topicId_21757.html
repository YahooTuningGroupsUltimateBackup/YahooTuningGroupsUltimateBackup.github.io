But the most recent ones I<br/>sent you look okay</p><p>Also some of the scales are shown in various rotations, which confuses the<br/>picture a bit.</p><p>So, I&apos;ve programmed it to show each scale and then its inversion, if non-symmetrical,<br/>and to show one only rotation of each scale.</p><p>Here are some new searches for various values of n-tet varying the number of notes,<br/>attached.</p><p>-----------------------------</p><p>Dan Stearns asked me to find the solution to a mathematical problem,<br/>to find all the scales with n notes that fold k-tet for any n,k.</p><p>Here a scale that folds k-tet is defined as one that has all the<br/>intervals of k-tet as diads.</p><p>The example he gave me to try was this beautiful 20-tet diatonic scale:<br/>0 3 7 8 12 15 18 20</p><p>In fact there are 15 proper 7 note scales that fold 20-tet<br/>(or 30 including inversions)</p><p>There&apos;s also a proper six note scale that folds 20-tet:<br/>1 4 5 2 3 5 (plus inversion)</p><p>The complete list of strictly proper scales that fold 20-tet for all numbers of notes is:<br/>* 1 3 3 2 3 2 3 3 !8 notes<br/>* 1 2 2 1 2 2 1 2 2 1 2 2 ! 12 notes<br/>* 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 ! 20 notes</p><p>I found these results by programming a computer search.<br/>All the strictly proper scales found so far that fold n-tet are<br/>symmetrical, and would be interesting to see if this<br/>can be proved as a general result.</p><p>Similar lists can be made for any n-tet, and I&apos;ve done a few<br/>of them - may post the results later.</p><p>This lead me to think about application to j.i.</p><p>The list of scales for 12-tet and 4 notes is:</p><p>[6 in cl. 1 and 3] 1 3 2 6 inv. 1 6 2 3<br/>1 2 4 5 inv. 1 5 4 2<br/>2 scales found for 12-tet and 4 notes</p><p>Legend:<br/>the [] indicates that a scale is ambiguous,<br/>Any proper scales are shown with an * (neither of these are)<br/>then []* = proper, * = strictly proper, neither = unambiguous<br/>improper and [] = ambiguous improper.</p><p>Had the thought to try these out in the syntonic j.i. scale</p><p>1 2 4 5 is:</p><p>1/1 16/15 6/5 3/2 2/1</p><p>This had the interesting property that all the syntonic j.i. scale ratios occur as<br/>intervals between pairs of notes, and there are no<br/>other intervals except for the inversion of the j.i. augmented fourth.</p><p>Rotations are:<br/>1/1 16/15 6/5 3/2 2/1<br/>1/1 4/3 64/45 8/5 2/1<br/>1/1 5/4 5/3 16/9 2/1<br/>1/1 9/8 45/32 15/8 2/1</p><p>Uses the j.i. scale with 16/9 instead of 9/5<br/>1/1 16/15 9/8 6/5 5/4 4/3 45/32 64/45 3/2 8/5 5/3 16/9 15/8 2/1</p><p>(example fractal tune)</p><p>Obviously if we include the augmented fourth we have to include its complement,<br/>so what about trying for a symmetrical eleven note scale instead:<br/>1/1 16/15 6/5 8/5 2/1<br/>1/1 5/4 4/3 3/2 2/1<br/>1/1 4/3 5/3 16/9 2/1<br/>1/1 9/8 3/2 15/8 2/1<br/>makes<br/>1/1 16/15 9/8 6/5 5/4 4/3 3/2 8/5 5/3 16/9 15/8 2/1</p><p>Then if you play in<br/>1/1 16/15 6/5 8/5 2/1<br/>all the intervals you get will be intervals of this<br/>scale and you can make any of them by playing two of<br/>the notes.</p><p>(example fractal tune)</p><p>Is there any other four note scale that does this?</p><p>Here is the complete list of all the four note scales<br/>that fold 11-tet</p><p>1 2 2 6 inv. 1 6 2 2<br/>[5 in cl. 1 and 2] 1 3 2 5 inv. 1 5 2 3<br/>1 6 3 1 inv. 1 1 3 6<br/>1 2 4 4 inv. 1 4 4 2<br/>[3 in cl. 1 and 2] 1 2 5 3 inv. 1 3 5 2<br/>1 3 6 1 inv. 1 1 6 3</p><p>So it will have to be one of these.</p><p>A check will confirm that none of them work.</p><p>....</p><p>then plan to do computer search to find all the<br/>chords that fold the 11-tet j.i. scale.</p><p>Might also try some other scales.</p><p>Any other suggestions for a symmetrical j.i.<br/>scale that might be nice to try to fold<br/>in this way?</p><p>Robert</p></div>
