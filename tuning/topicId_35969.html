I am certain Peter<br/>will be more than happy to send the plug-in to anybody interested:</p><p>Joseph</p><p>Approx a year ago I wrote a plugin to playback microtonal music in<br/>Sibelius.</p><p>It works by, for each temperament, setting up a table of pitch<br/>classes and associating each with a deviation in cents from 12tone<br/>ET. When you run the plugin, it reads through the selection,<br/>compares each pitchclass with the table, and converts the deviation<br/>into a Midi pitchbend command.</p><p>It uses the pitch classes that are available in Sibelius ie for C you<br/>can have double flat, flat, natural, sharp, double-sharp, and 1/4<br/>tone and 3/4 tone flat and sharp.</p><p>Each of these can be set to a different tuning so you can have a<br/>different tuning for eg D# and Eb etc. By using all the available<br/>pitch classes, as above, you could even create a 63note temperament<br/>(I have done it). So far I have approx 40 temperaments.</p><p>In terms of notation, the plugin is currently limited to the<br/>accidentals mentioned above, as they are recognizable<br/>by the Manuscript language. The signs that you have mentioned for 1/3<br/>tone 1/6 tone etc would have to go in the Symbols table and I don&apos;t<br/>think there is any way yet within Manuscript to recognize them.</p><p>If you&apos;re interested I&apos;ll send you a copy.</p><p>Peter Walton</p></div>
