If John wants to come up with an overall &quot;goodness&quot;<br/>&gt;&gt; measure for triads that weights the consonance from various<br/>&gt;&gt; psychoacoustic factors, he certainly can (and I think that he has<br/>&gt;&gt; previously). Ease of F0 estimation, critical band interactions, and<br/>&gt;&gt; &quot;tonalness&quot; (if it&apos;s different from the first criterion) are all<br/>&gt;&gt; things that could be weighted in here.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Really I just like the look and feel of John&apos;s formula, and I tend to trust mathematical elegance.</p><p>Unfortunately, nothing about the workings of the brain or the inner<br/>ear are mathematically elegant. This is partly why they&apos;re so hard to<br/>model.</p><p>Many people have come onto these lists and decided that all music can<br/>be explained by secret patterns in numbers. In contrast, other folks<br/>have decided that things like psychoacoustics play more of a role.<br/>Coming up with a mathematically elegant, quick &quot;rule of thumb&quot; that<br/>approximates the behavior of more complex models is a worthy goal. I<br/>don&apos;t think John claims that this is what he&apos;s doing, but rather that<br/>his equation is a psychoacoustic model in and of itself.</p><p>&gt; I think such a formula would be a useful tool, and that it could even reveal a pragmatic psychophysical truth. I am just starting down my microtonal study, but I wonder if Tenney height might rate certain (few) intervals a little to highly.</p><p>What&apos;s more important is to know the concepts behind each model.<br/>Tenney height matches a lot of intervals a little too &quot;lowly,&quot; namely<br/>things like 500000/400001, which are indistinguishable from 5/4. But<br/>the point of Tenney height is just to reflect that the consonance of<br/>intervals tends to roughly follow an n*d pattern.</p><p>&gt; I definitely think John&apos;s model should be adapted to basically reflect reality where needed, however.</p><p>You are allowed to be a fan of John&apos;s model if you want. Again, the<br/>important thing is to understand the concepts at play here.</p><p>&gt;&gt; The information theory word for surprisal is entropy. So if you&apos;re<br/>&gt;&gt; into this interpretation of John&apos;s model, then you should probably<br/>&gt;&gt; look into harmonic entropy, which aims to measure this directly.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Although there are historically many somewhat inconsistent terms and interpretations when it comes to information, entropy, and symmetry, the only other names I know surprisal to go by are self-information, information value, and bit width of a fraction.<br/>&gt; &nbsp;I do notice that Wikipedia states &quot;The information entropy of a random event is the expected value of its self-information&quot;. Is this what you mean?</p><p>Yes. Perhaps I misspoke. Looks like it&apos;s saying that entropy is the<br/>expected value of self-information, and surprisal is self-information.<br/>I was taught that entropy is self-information, which Wikipedia<br/>acknowledges is a common usage of the word here:</p><p>&quot;The term self-information is also sometimes used as a synonym of<br/>entropy, i.e. the expected value of self-information in the first<br/>sense, because I(X;X) = H(X), where I(X;X) is the mutual information<br/>of X with itself.[1]&quot;</p><p>&gt; I definitely want to look into harmonic entropy when I get the chance. Honestly, though, I may prefer simply to review the data that is produced by such methods.</p><p>Here&apos;s a somewhat decent page on it:</p><p><a href="http://sonic-arts.org/td/erlich/entropy.htm">http://sonic-arts.org/td/erlich/entropy.htm</a></p><p>Note that it doesn&apos;t represent critical band effects, but 60 cents<br/>turns out to be pretty dissonant anyways for other reasons.</p><p>&gt;&gt; The main difference between this and HE is that John assumes a<br/>&gt;&gt; rectangular mistuning range of 256/255 in either direction, where<br/>&gt;&gt; anything that&apos;s in the range is &quot;good&quot; and anything outside of it is<br/>&gt;&gt; &quot;bad.&quot;<br/>&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt; HE assumes a Gaussian-tapered range with a variable standard deviation<br/>&gt;&gt; (usually 1-1.2%) and is deliberately set up so that the probabilities<br/>&gt;&gt; overlap. The more intervals that an interval &quot;activates,&quot;<br/>&gt;&gt; the more information the signal carries, hence the more surprising it<br/>&gt;&gt; is, hence the higher in entropy it is.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; That&apos;s good, but is it elegant? I can punch out John&apos;s formula on my calculator for any set of notes. Once again, that doesn&apos;t mean John&apos;s methods are valid, but I tend to think a simple method may lead to more significant discoveries concerning interpretation.</p><p>It&apos;s not elegant at all, but it&apos;s accurate.

Why the random numbers 256 and 255, divided with<br/>&gt; one another?</p><p>Here&apos;s the &quot;guess&quot;. Powers of 2 kept on appearing in my research. 1/1 to 2/1 seems like the best range for a melody, both notes sounding more resolved than any other note in between or beyond.</p><p>Testing dissonance using sine wave tones it seemed that either 16/15 or 17/16 was the most dissonant sine wave interval, 16 is a power of 2.</p><p>In melody (my formula is 2/x + 2/y for both sine waves and complex tones with a &apos;regular&apos; timbre) it seems that any melodic interval with a value between 2.0 and 4.0 sounds like a &quot;Super Major&quot;. Any value between 1.0 and 1.9999 sounds like an &quot;ordinary&quot; Major (I call it a Blue Major). Any value between 0.5 and 0.9999 sounds like an &quot;ordinary&quot; minor (I call it a Blue Minor). Any value between 0.25 and 0.4999 sounds like an Ultra Minor. All of the above sound &quot;sweet&quot; to me. Next, a melodic interval with a value between 0.125 and 0.2499 sounds &quot;tolerable&quot; to me but not sweet. Finally an interval with a value of less than 0.125 sounds to me to be &quot;intolerable&quot;. Each successive range is half of the previous range...1, 1/2, 1/4, 1/8, 1/16, 1/32.</p><p>So I guessed at 256/255 (6.776 cents) because 256 is power of 2 and a few listening tests confirmed (to me at least) that it was an acceptable tempering value. Next I tried an 8 cent tempering and could just about detect a slight hint of dissonance (I&apos;m pretty fussy) and so ruled it out. With dissonance I chose 16/15 (15 is one less than 16). Similarly I chose 256/255 because 255 is one less than 256. Think of 1/16 or 1/256.</p><p>&gt;<br/>&gt; Tempering 5/4 sharp by 14 cents sounds acceptable to most of the<br/>&gt; western world, as does tempering 6/5 16 cents flat, so I&apos;m not sure<br/>&gt; your results apply.</p><p>I worked out my formulas for *me* and not the western world.

It still sounds like it might be pointing to 1,<br/>however, because of the strength of the 4/3 on the outside. Adding a<br/>3/2 above the 3 gets you 6:9:12:14:16, which sounds even more minor.</p><p>I&apos;ll skip to 8:9:10 - 8:9:10 resolves to 1 and there&apos;s not much wrong<br/>with this. Double the 8 down an octave and it sounds the same. Put<br/>some other notes on the bottom and it may not sound the same. Since<br/>this is a rooted triad, it&apos;s not a case where you can create<br/>uncorrelated periodicity information by just doubling the root down an<br/>octave. The fact that you -can- do this for other chords is what is<br/>significant.</p><p>7:8:9 to my ears sounds ambiguous and also sounds like while it can be<br/>very clearly heard as 7:8:9, it&apos;s on the brink of also sounding like a<br/>sharp 8:9:10. Double the 7 down an octave to get 6:14:16:18 and if<br/>you&apos;re using sines, this should just sound like a sharp 4:8:9:10. Do<br/>it with harmonic timbres and things start to sound a bit more<br/>interesting, although not quite minor.</p><p>&gt; And, hey, what about 6:8:9? That one *doesn&apos;t* sound minor, but by your method of analysis, it&apos;s not a whole lot different from 6:7:9. Or how about 9:10:12? Shouldn&apos;t that sound minor too?</p><p>This is the one interesting exception I&apos;ve found to the rule and I&apos;m<br/>not sure exactly how to explain it. In this case, doubling the octave<br/>down gives 3:6:8:9, but this doesn&apos;t cause the characteristic &quot;minor&quot;<br/>feel. In this case, I think the dominant structures are the 1:2:3 on<br/>the outside and the 6:8 as a 3:4 pointing to 2; I&apos;m not sure if the<br/>8:9 is getting any action or the 6:8:9 as a triad. All I can say to<br/>this is that 4/3 is a very strong interval, and it may just be harder<br/>for the brain to snap it into some kind of &quot;aperiodic&quot; perception than<br/>it is for the 7 in 6:7:9. I haven&apos;t found any other exceptions than<br/>this one and perhaps some inversions of it.</p><p>&gt; All I can say is that to me, the only chords that sound &quot;minor&quot; are chords that sound something like minor triads, which is to say any inversion of a chord of 0 cents, 260-340 cents, and 660-740 cents. Adding a fourth interval or tuning any of those intervals out of the ranges I gave always leads (at least to my ears) to a different emotional place. I don&apos;t think any of the chords you&apos;ve suggested that don&apos;t fit this pattern share any emotionally-significant qualities with the chords that do.</p><p>1) Check the semitonal JI thread.<br/>2) It&apos;s not that I&apos;m saying that random chords that aren&apos;t around<br/>0-300-700 cents will sound, in every sense of the word, &quot;minor.&quot;<br/>3) Part of the perception of minorness is a vague kind of polytonality<br/>in which the brain hears multiple harmonic structures that fit<br/>together the wrong way.<br/>4) This part of the perception of minorness can be replicated to<br/>varying degrees in other chords that will obviously not be in the same<br/>triadic range as &quot;minor.&quot; Sometimes they don&apos;t sound &quot;minor&quot; but<br/>rather &quot;neutral&quot; or sometimes they sound like something completely<br/>different. But they do not sound resolved and tonal and major, which<br/>is the point.</p><p>Here&apos;s a question - which sounds more like an &quot;even more minor than<br/>minor&quot; version of of the 5-limit minor chord to you? 70:84:105:120,<br/>the 7-limit minor chord, or 40:48:60:75, which places an additional<br/>5/4 above the 3/2? How about 10:12:15:19?</p><p>How about these two:</p><p>2310:3465:4620:5544:6930:7920:10080:12320 (the 11-limit minor chord),<br/>or 10:15:20:24:30:38:44:52</p><p>&gt; I can&apos;t really buy your theory unless you can produce a triad outside of the ranges I specified that makes me think of/feel something remarkably similar to a triad within the ranges I specified.</p><p>This isn&apos;t &quot;my&quot; theory. It&apos;s &quot;a&quot; theory. I think I should be able to<br/>discuss how psychoacoustic factors play a role in musical perception<br/>without it turning into some kind of &quot;ownership&quot; thing. And for the<br/>record, Carl is the first person who I&apos;d seen suggest it, as before<br/>this I had taken up Paul&apos;s ideas about minorness being caused by<br/>scalar structure.</p><p>As for producing a triad, I dunno, but maybe 10:15:16:18:20 will do<br/>the trick. Or perhaps 10:15:16:18:22 or 10:15:16:18:23. I guess<br/>10:15:16 will do as a triad.</p><p>A note: Check the semitonal JI thread I linked you to and perhaps<br/>you&apos;ll see what I&apos;m getting at. If not, and if you insist on<br/>continually framing this as you have in the past as me trying to<br/>promote &quot;my&quot; theory, instead of two intelligent people having a<br/>discussion about psychoacoustics in music, then I don&apos;t really want to<br/>talk about it anymore. I do not claim to have the perfect answer - in<br/>fact, I claim the opposite - but I do not want to discuss stuff like<br/>this anymore unless it&apos;s on fair-minded terms.</p><p>-Mike</p></div><h3><a id=97180 href="#97180">ðŸ”—</a>Mike Battaglia &#x3C;battaglia01@...&#x3E;</h3><span>3/20/2011 4:34:21 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>On Sun, Mar 20, 2011 at 6:52 PM, john777music &lt;jfos777@...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; --- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, Mike Battaglia &lt;battaglia01@...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; On Sun, Mar 20, 2011 at 2:02 PM, john777music &lt;jfos777@...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; I looked up Tenney Height on Tonalsoft and it seems to be x multiplied by y (x/y is a JI interval). x*y does not occur in my formula...<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; (2 + 1/x + 1/y - diss(x,y))/2<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; 1/x + 1/y = (x+y)/(x*y). x*y is Tenney Height,<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Yeah, but what about the 1/x + 1/y?

Why the random numbers 256 and 255, divided with<br/>&gt; &gt; one another?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Here&apos;s the &quot;guess&quot;. Powers of 2 kept on appearing in my research. 1/1 to 2/1 seems like the best range for a melody, both notes sounding more resolved than any other note in between or beyond.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Testing dissonance using sine wave tones it seemed that either 16/15 or 17/16 was the most dissonant sine wave interval, 16 is a power of 2.</p><p>OK, but this is my point. There is no clear explanation for why. Your<br/>explanations are always like &quot;it just seemed to me at the time to be<br/>right.&quot;</p><p>&gt; In melody (my formula is 2/x + 2/y for both sine waves and complex tones with a &apos;regular&apos; timbre) it seems that any melodic interval with a value between 2.0 and 4.0 sounds like a &quot;Super Major&quot;. Any value between 1.0 and 1.9999 sounds like an &quot;ordinary&quot; Major (I call it a Blue Major). Any value between 0.5 and 0.9999 sounds like an &quot;ordinary&quot; minor (I call it a Blue Minor). Any value between 0.25 and 0.4999 sounds like an Ultra Minor. All of the above sound &quot;sweet&quot; to me. Next, a melodic interval with a value between 0.125 and 0.2499 sounds &quot;tolerable&quot; to me but not sweet. Finally an interval with a value of less than 0.125 sounds to me to be &quot;intolerable&quot;. Each successive range is half of the previous range...1, 1/2, 1/4, 1/8, 1/16, 1/32.</p><p>I don&apos;t see how, mathematically, this has to do with anything above,<br/>other than the number 2 is involved.</p><p>&gt; So I guessed at 256/255 (6.776 cents) because 256 is power of 2 and a few listening tests confirmed (to me at least) that it was an acceptable tempering value. Next I tried an 8 cent tempering and could just about detect a slight hint of dissonance (I&apos;m pretty fussy) and so ruled it out. With dissonance I chose 16/15 (15 is one less than 16). Similarly I chose 256/255 because 255 is one less than 256. Think of 1/16 or 1/256.</p><p>OK. Well, that&apos;s how you came up with it. I&apos;m not convinced that this<br/>is how the ear works. If you&apos;d like to keep exploring your system, go<br/>right ahead. It would be nice if you tried to work your research in<br/>with the rest of the research that has been done here.</p><p>&gt; &gt; Tempering 5/4 sharp by 14 cents sounds acceptable to most of the<br/>&gt; &gt; western world, as does tempering 6/5 16 cents flat, so I&apos;m not sure<br/>&gt; &gt; your results apply.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I worked out my formulas for *me* and not the western world. Sure you can &quot;get away&quot; with the mistunings you list above but I&apos;m aiming for perfection or close enough to it.</p><p>Then your formulas apply to you and not the western world.</p><p>&gt; &gt; The only explanation that I have read is that this is the formula<br/>&gt; &gt; you&apos;ve picked because you like the results.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; This is partly true, the results do look &quot;cute&quot;, magic numbers if you will. I guessed at hundreds of possible combinations of formulas and slowly eliminated them one by one (over a 14 year period making lots of mistakes) until I arrived at what I considered to be the most likely formula. It&apos;s not so much that &quot;it must be formula &apos;a&apos;&quot; but rather &quot;it can&apos;t be b or c or d or e or f or g or h etc&quot;.</p><p>More power to you, and you should always feel encouraged to do<br/>research. The emerging theory that has come out of this list, which I<br/>am very much a proponent of, is ongoing and has also spanned a period<br/>of a decade and a half. It has so far included a world class<br/>mathematician, several psychoacoustics experts, ethnomusicologists,<br/>several outstanding composers and musicians, medieval music<br/>historians, and so on. (I believe Carl claimed at one point a<br/>neuroscientist was on here...?) I have been playing music since I was<br/>two years old, and after having had teachers all my life and then<br/>paying $50,000 to go to music school, I have never received a better<br/>education in music theory at any point in my life than I have on this<br/>list.</p><p>In light of this, I am very respectful of the work that has been done<br/>so far and aim to try to contribute to it as best I can. I feel it is<br/>of a high quality and actually makes sense in a way that many other<br/>theories don&apos;t. Again, you should always feel encouraged to do your<br/>own research, but there is no need to get upset if I also try to<br/>inform newcomers of the drawbacks and advantages between different<br/>models. And you should definitely not feel upset if I&apos;m trying to help<br/>you relate your model to existing models that have a bit more<br/>explanatory power behind them.</p><p>&gt; &gt; There&apos;s also the fact that you haven&apos;t explained why a 12-tet major<br/>&gt; &gt; chord sounds great to almost every single person living on the planet,<br/>&gt; &gt; but contains no intervals that you&apos;d mark &quot;good.&quot;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I never said that. In the 12TET open E Major chord on a guitar (E,B,E,G#,B,E) all the intervals that occur are within 6.776 cents of any of my own &quot;good&quot; intervals except the intervals that contain the G#. And why should it be my responsibility to explain this anyway?</p><p>It should be your responsibility to explain this because I thought the<br/>point of your theory is that it predicts what will sound &quot;good.&quot; And<br/>my point is that 12-tet sounds so good that people have been driven<br/>towards moments of enlightenment while listening to, playing, or<br/>composing in it.

O&apos;Sullivan is (t^2-a^2)/(2t) = t/2 - a^2/(2t), both go to infinity, but not at the same rate.</p></div><h3><a id=97188 href="#97188">ðŸ”—</a>Daniel Nielsen &#x3C;nielsed@...&#x3E;</h3><span>3/20/2011 5:17:26 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Umm, ignore my last 3 sentences, please.
