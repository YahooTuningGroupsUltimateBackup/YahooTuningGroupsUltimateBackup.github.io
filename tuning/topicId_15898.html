I play a Goya G10 acoustic guitar, made fretless by<br/>Starrett, and it has a marvelous sound. It has a pickup, so when I play<br/>amplified I add a bit of eq to smooth it out...but, when I rehearse with<br/>my koto friend, I play unamplified and it still sounds great. I also<br/>have 19 and 34 tone acoustics, both Goyas...I seek these guitars out,<br/>and I believe they were a superior brand, for some reason I am not sure<br/>of. Almost all Goyas I&apos;ve found sound superb. I also played my Roland GR<br/>300 electric synth guitar on a show recently, made fretless again by<br/>Starrett, and found the sound very full, no distortion. I am sure that<br/>treating a neck can help sustain, but I also believe that some of the<br/>sound/tonal quality is in the hands. Most guitar Maestros have very<br/>strong hands, and it surely can make a difference...hope you get a good<br/>axe made...Hstick</p></div><h3><a id=15940 href="#15940">ðŸ”—</a>Seth Austen &#x3C;acoustic@landmarknet.net&#x3E;</h3><span>11/27/2000 12:40:53 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>on 11/26/00 10:06 PM, <a href="mailto:tuning@egroups.com">tuning@egroups.com</a> at <a href="mailto:tuning@egroups.com">tuning@egroups.com</a> wrote:</p><p>&gt; Message: 10<br/>&gt; Date: Sun, 26 Nov 2000 11:02:03 -0700<br/>&gt; From: Neil Haverstick &lt;<a href="mailto:STICK@USWEST.NET">STICK@USWEST.NET</a>&gt;<br/>&gt; Subject: fretless again<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Yo Seth...I put this post on a few days ago, but it never made it<br/>&gt; because of an error.

I believe Martin had something to do with<br/>them for a time. These days, you can find them for the cost of a cheap<br/>import, and it&apos;s all solid woods.</p><p>I&apos;m following a few luthier leads, hopefully I should have myself a fretless<br/>guitar soon.
