What<br/>&gt;&gt;percent of pitch-class space is filled?  2. What percent of pitch class<br/>&gt;&gt;space is more than singly-filled?  It may be best to formulate this measure<br/>&gt;&gt;graphically, rather than worry about which numbers to show.  If you take a<br/>&gt;&gt;tonality diamond, and look down the diagonals, you have the pitch classes.<br/>&gt;&gt;One could imagine a graph where each of the pitch classes would be<br/>&gt;&gt;color-coded strips, with overlapping areas florescent orange, or so.  A<br/>&gt;&gt;little practice looking at these and the user would probably be able to<br/>&gt;&gt;tell more about the melodic properties of a scale, faster, than anybody<br/>&gt;&gt;else.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;I don&apos;t get it.</p><p>I wasn&apos;t too clear.  I&apos;m after a graphic representation of the Rothenberg interval matrix (tonality diamond).  Imagine a line segment representing an octave, pitch ascending from left to right, on a log scale.  For each scale degree, plot a point for each occurance in each mode and color a segment connecting all the points.  The measures are then: 1. What percent of the line is colored?  2. What percent of the line is more than singly covered?  It might be better to ask the second question in terms of the first, 2b. What percent of the colored space contains overlaps?

Pitch is on the y axis, and on the x axis, at equally-spaced intervals, are the scale degrees.  Then the modes can be shown as lines on the graph by connecting the right dots at each scale degree.  If a pair of line cross, there&apos;s impropriety.  The overlap could be colored in, and the area could be used as length was in the first version.</p><p>-C.</p></div><h3><a id=3897 href="#3897">ðŸ”—</a>Paul H.

I believe that all<br/>improper scales will have crossing lines, but I&apos;m not sure.  In any case,<br/>it isn&apos;t crossing that indicates propriety.</p><p>What does indicate propriety is the slope of the lines.  They&apos;ve got to go<br/>up to be strictly proper.  If two intervals are connected by a line<br/>parallel to the x-axis, then they are &quot;ambiguous&quot;.
