In his fine popular<br/>&gt; account of the theory, _The Elegant Universe_, Brian Greene mentions<br/>&gt; the idea of multiple time dimensions, but implies that as yet no<br/>&gt; physicist has come up with a coherent conception of what that would<br/>&gt; even mean. So let alone the question of being able to observe time as<br/>&gt; multi-dimensional, we are still probably a long way from even being<br/>&gt; able to conceive of it that way.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; But what does this have to do with tuning?<br/>&gt;</p><p>The string theory has to do with the smallest microphysical units and would theoretically<br/>provide the researcher with the &quot;seat of the soul&quot; or the smallest possible unit consciousness<br/>can reside in.  One should find the interface of subjective perception of the musical intervals<br/>and the actual intervals themselves.  I mean, that since it is the smallest possible unit of<br/>matter possible, we would see the interface of physical divisions of the octave with the<br/>subjective perception of them (quantum wave thoughts/music apperception at the quantum wave<br/>level----the two should be identical at the smallest level due to the univesality of Bode&apos;s Law<br/>on wave motion including &quot;love&quot; vibes.  &quot;Vibes&quot; are waves, too).  Because very few musicians<br/>have perfect microtonal pitch or absolute microtonal pitch currently, if this research was to<br/>hurry up and write up the equations for everyone to see then someone could figure out the best<br/>possible microtonal scale and then the best possible and most versatile divisions of them.<br/>This Unified Microtonal Scale should be characterized by simplicity yet universality.  This is<br/>also foolish because the symmetrical keyboard and something like The Microzone Keyboard are<br/>giving people more useful access to microtones and soon enough the natural human ear will pick<br/>up on the needed ordering of the microtonal divisions.  Either some mathematician is going to<br/>stumble upon it or some musician is going to figure out which is the best universal microtonal<br/>scale.<br/>      10 strings is useful for the quantum particles and they are based on threefold groups.<br/>The quarks I mean.  So I think that the Universal Microtonal scale would have to divide things<br/>by threes.  This is the case in the 72 tone ideal Pythagorean scale, except that they add a<br/>positive 3 and a negative 3 which is a Babylonian practice as old as the Hurrian tablets (they<br/>used this for their astronomical divisions of the sky). But then I am an avid 23 tone user and<br/>72 tones doesn&apos;t accomodate it neatly enough so I doubt 72 tones is the proper division.  Maybe<br/>something like hybrid scales....I tune two different 23 tone scales at a perfect 5th apart or a<br/>perfect 4th apart. Then these are accessed by two different keyboards stacked on each other.<br/>Hybrid scales could easily be facilitated by the Microzone keyboard.</p><p>I think this conjecturing is hopeless for now because I don&apos;t have a working keyboard to<br/>aurally test these things.  I&apos;ve never even heard the 72 tone scale.  I just got it out of some<br/>books on astronomy and mystical geometry.</p><p>Remember the movie &quot;Rainman&quot;?  With Dustin Hoffman&apos;s unique autistic counting ability?  We need<br/>a geometer like Monz or the Anaphorian guy with a natural microtonal ear (absolutely perfect<br/>pitch).  Someone like that could get all these theories straight and then we&apos;d have a universal<br/>notation and then some of us less talented could start making tone rows and really start to<br/>explore this stuff.   I bet you China already had this Universal Microtonal Scale and that&apos;s<br/>what was lost with the burning of the Sixth Wing or Chinese classic and it&apos;s also possible that<br/>one of the experts here have also stumbled on it and are about to tell me to go to a URL where<br/>I will see charts and graphs of it.   I hope so.</p><p>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; You do not need web access to participate.  You may subscribe through<br/>&gt; email.
