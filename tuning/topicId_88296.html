I also wonder if there&apos;s an existing name/theory for such a method...although so far I have yet to hear of one.</p><p>Any thoughts or suggestions?</p></div><h3><a id=88307 href="#88307">ðŸ”—</a>cityoftheasleep &#x3C;igliashon@...&#x3E;</h3><span>4/27/2010 10:30:08 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Ah, tempered fifths...</p><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, Michael &lt;djtrancendance@...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;       I did a blind test on intervals around 3/2 and I learned something.

Better yet, try either of those in a triad with a 7/6 or a 9/8.  There seems to be a little &quot;zone&quot; around 3/2 where if you&apos;re between 15 and 25 cents sharp or flat of a perfect 3/2, you get significant roughness, but when you get close to a 30-cent deviation, you start landing on some more stable intervals.    These intervals may not sound great on their own (though they sound better an octave up), but when you make them part of a triad they can sound actually perfectly stable.</p><p>Don&apos;t believe it?  Listen for yourself: I recently put up a guitar piece on the xenharmonic ning called &quot;Into the Gloam&quot; in 18-EDO, which hits both of those intervals (32/21 and 22/15) very close to Just, and I think you&apos;ll find the chords in that song sound remarkably stable.</p><p>OTOH, I notice that 16-EDO hits very close to that 34/23 at 675 cents, and I find that interval &quot;unusable&quot; as a fifth (though it&apos;s good for different purposes!), even though it&apos;s &quot;closer&quot; in pitch to a 3/2 than is 22/15 or 32/21.</p><p>16/11 I would NEVER suggest as an alternative to the fifth...despite its low complexity, it packs a decidedly-dissonant bite more akin to a species of tritone.  When I used to play a Catler 12-tone Ultra Plus guitar, which has (among other things) frets for a Just 11/8 (which can also be used to make a 16/11), I could rarely distinguish 11/8 from sqrt(2)/1 (600 cents) unless played in a high register.  Ditto 16/11.  50 cents from a 3/2 is too far to maintain the functionality of a fifth.</p><p>An interval of 3/5 of an octave (720 cents) lands almost precisely at a 50/33, you could give that a try too as it seems to be on some sort of psychoacoustic threshold.  It beats, but if you put it in a triad with a good major or minor third, it seems to work just fine.  Easley Blackwood considered the triads of 15-EDO stable enough to serve as a final sonority in a piece, and I&apos;ve found the triads of 25-EDO (which feature either a 9/7 or 5/4 which are very near Just) work pretty darn well also.</p></div><h3><a id=88316 href="#88316">ðŸ”—</a>Michael &#x3C;djtrancendance@...&#x3E;</h3><span>4/27/2010 11:37:27 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Bizarre, the 22/15 (1.46666 works quite well for me) despite being in the middle of an area of sour tones.  50/33 actually works quite beautifully as well...surprisingly relaxed feel.</p><p>Igs&gt;&quot;An interval of 3/5 of an octave (720 cents) lands almost precisely at a<br/>50/33&quot;<br/>     Ah mirroring around simple intervals &quot;strikes again&quot;...that &quot;mirroring&quot; has to be one of the most useful theories I&apos;ve seen, along with harmonic entropy and critical band dissonance.
