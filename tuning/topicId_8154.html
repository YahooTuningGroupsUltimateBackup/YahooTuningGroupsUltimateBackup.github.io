Did you ever reach any<br/>&gt;decisive conclusions (etc.)?</p><p>Nope -- I&apos;m hoping to receive a response to a private e-mail to John Conway,<br/>no doubt a very busy man. However, the general shape of the harmonic entropy<br/>curve, and in particular the ratios at (or near) which minima occur, seem<br/>remarkably stable from Farey limit 20 to 1000+ (given simga = 1%). If you<br/>can believe that the ear gives up somewhere in that range, you can believe<br/>the general features of the harmonic entropy curve.</p><p>What presents a bigger challenge is a harmonic entropy measure for chords of<br/>three or more notes.</p></div>
