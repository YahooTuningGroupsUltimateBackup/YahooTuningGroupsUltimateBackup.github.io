I re-downloaded and it is OK.</p><p>&gt; the number of yellow pixels is less than 1% of the number of white<br/>&gt; pixels. so i doubt that changing from yellow to some other color<br/>&gt; would significantly change the amount of light coming out.</p><p>The point is not how many are yellow, it&apos;s that the ones that are are so close in the light spectrum to the white. It is tiring on the eyes and more difficult to see than a slightly darker hue. I couldn&apos;t even see that they were dotted/dashed til I zoomed in quite a bit.</p><p>One thing to keep in mind: while the light in a room may vary, a printed page will look (essentially) identical when distributed to many people, but the many variations on how a person will have set the controls on their monitor (brightness, contrast, and especially the gamma correction) makes color decisions for these images difficult. It could be that your monitor is set darker than most.</p><p>Anyhow, it is up to you; I could certainly make samples with other colors, as it is easy to alter the .gif palettes and resave. But if you ignore the studies of people who study people looking at monitors, you run the risk of having less impressive results than you seek.</p><p>Cheers,<br/>Jon</p></div><h3><a id=39858 href="#39858">ðŸ”—</a>Carl Lumma &#x3C;clumma@yahoo.com&#x3E;</h3><span>10/21/2002 6:59:01 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>&gt; this is very strange. when i look at the file,<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; <a href="/tuning/files/perlich/xoomer.gif">/tuning/files/perlich/xoomer.gif</a><br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; using internet explorer, either today or on the day i posted it, it<br/>&gt; looks just fine! you guys must be using something else, then? what<br/>&gt; could be happening?
