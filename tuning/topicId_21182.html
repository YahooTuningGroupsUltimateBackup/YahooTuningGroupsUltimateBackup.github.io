I am thinking about sorting the tunings in the scala<br/>&gt; archive so that it is easier to navigate, and find certain types of scales.<br/>&gt; My plan is to sort them by octave divisions first, and then possibly other<br/>&gt; devisions.  Would others be interested in having this edited archive, and<br/>&gt; how would you suggest that it be sorted and changed?</p><p>I&apos;ve already done something along this lines with my Fractal Tune Smithy<br/>program - it has a drop list of all the scales in the Scala archive,<br/>and you can sort it in various ways.</p><p>I&apos;m also interested in adding more sort options.</p><p>You can then save the sorted list, and here is the start of one of them:</p><p>+1 492.000 cents 625.000 cents African Mboko Mouth Bow (chordophone, single string, plucked)<br/>1 400.00000 cents 2/1 ogr2.scl | Optimal Golomb Ruler of 2 segments, length 3<br/>1 3/1 4/1 gradus3.scl | Intervals &gt; 1 with Gradus = 3<br/>1 99/70 2/1 fj-2tet.scl | Franck Jedrzejewski continued fractions approx. of 2-tet<br/>1 32/29 1/2 16/29 chimes.scl | Heavenly Chimes<br/>1 166.01500 cents 332.03000 cents 4/3 cet166.scl | 3rd root of 4/3<br/>1 200.00000 cents 800.00000 cents 2/1 ogr3.scl | Optimal Golomb Ruler of 3 segments, length 6<br/>1 5/4 3/2 7/4 harm3.scl | Third octave of the harmonic overtone series<br/>1 77/61 97/61 2/1 temp3ebt.scl | Cycle of 3 equal beating thirds<br/>1 63/50 27/17 2/1 fj-3tet.scl | Franck Jedrzejewski continued fractions approx. of 3-tet<br/>1 3/2 6/1 8/1 gradus4.scl | Intervals &gt; 1 with Gradus = 4<br/>1 91/90 35/33 219/160 16/3 iter31.scl | Iterated Kidjel Ratio Scale, IE=16/3, PD=3, SD=0<br/>1 5/4 25/16 125/64 2/1 efg555.scl | Genus quartum [555]</p><p>That one was sorted by number of notes, so shows the 2 note scales, then 3 notes, then so on,<br/>and within each one, sorts with the one with the smallest step size first, then<br/>for those with same smallest step size, ones with most of the smallest steps first.</p><p>Other options are to sort by number of superparticular intervals,<br/>largest superparticular interval, alphabetically by title,<br/>and various other ways</p><p>I also did a list sorted by the n-valence, where 2-valent = myhills<br/>property, which you can find in the files area of the TL.</p><p>So, mayabe is relevant to your project, and could save some duplicated work, or maybe<br/>we could share ideas.</p><p>Robert</p></div>
