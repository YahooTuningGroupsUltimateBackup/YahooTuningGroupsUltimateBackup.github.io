Schulter &#x3C;MSCHULTER@VALUE.NET&#x3E;</h3><span>1/2/2001 2:00:24 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Hello, there, Alita Morrison, and everyone.</p><p>Please let me begin by saying that like many other tunings, 1/4-comma<br/>meantone can be precisely defined in mathematical terms, but will vary<br/>in &quot;real world&quot; realizations, whether on a 16th-century harpsichord<br/>tuned by ear or on a modern synthesizer with limited pitch resolution.<br/>Below I&apos;m including a Scala file and a frequency table from Scala (a<br/>fine and free tuning program by Manuel op de Coul available on the<br/>Internet).</p><p>(Around 1600 in Naples, a 19-note instrument with split keys was<br/>rather popular, the Scala scale archive includes a file for this<br/>tuning also, meanquar_19.scl.)</p><p>In 1571, Gioseffo Zarlino published what may be the first<br/>comprehensive mathematical description of this tuning, which Aaron<br/>(1523) may have defined more informally, and which Vicentino (1555)<br/>likely used for his archicembalo with 36 notes per octave (in his<br/>first tuning, 31 of them dividing the octave into nearly equal parts<br/>of a circulating system, and the other five being used to provide pure<br/>fifths for a few common notes). Interestingly, the great Spanish<br/>theorist Salinas (1577) reports that he was considered the &quot;inventor&quot;<br/>of this tuning during his stay in Rome about 40 years earlier.</p><p>The special quality of 1/4-comma meantone is that it has pure major<br/>thirds at 5:4. Whether many 16th-century tuners focused especially on<br/>these thirds is an open question, and Aaron&apos;s instructions of 1523<br/>present an interesting case.</p><p>He says to start by tuning the octave C-C and the third C-E &quot;as<br/>sonorous and just as possible,&quot; with &quot;the greatest possible unity.&quot;<br/>Then the major third C-E is used as the basis for a chain of four<br/>fifths, each of which should be a bit narrower than pure by the same<br/>amount: C-G-D-A-E. Then the rest of the tuning is completed by moving<br/>in fifths in either direction.</p><p>Zarlino more precisely defines that each fifth should be narrow by an<br/>amount equal to 1/4 of the syntonic comma (81:80, ~21.51 cents), the<br/>amount by which four pure fifths minus two octaves would exceed a pure<br/>5:4 third. Using the logarithmic measure of cents, logarithms and<br/>their application to music developing in the 17th century, we can say<br/>that such a fifth is approximately 5.38 cents narrower than pure, with<br/>a size of about 696.5784 cents.</p><p>Here is a table of frequencies for a 17-note tuning in 1/4-comma meantone<br/>(Gb-A#) using a pitch level with C equal to its value in a modern tuning<br/>with A=440. Since 16th-century instruments suggest that absolute pitches<br/>often varied widely on both sides of that level, with an average for a<br/>sample of some preserved wind instruments of A=466, maybe the modern<br/>default isn&apos;t such a bad choice as one possible starting point. To the<br/>Scala frequency data output I have added note names, with C4 as middle C:</p><p>|<br/>  0: 261.6256 Hertz     8.00000 oct [C4]<br/>  1: 273.3743 Hertz     8.06337 oct [C#4]<br/>  2: 279.9355 Hertz     8.09759 oct [Db4]<br/>  3: 292.5063 Hertz     8.16096 oct [D4]<br/>  4: 305.6418 Hertz     8.22434 oct [D#4]<br/>  5: 312.9772 Hertz     8.25855 oct [Eb4]<br/>  6: 327.0320 Hertz     8.32193 oct [E4]<br/>  7: 349.9192 Hertz     8.41952 oct [F4]<br/>  8: 365.6329 Hertz     8.48289 oct [F#4]<br/>  9: 391.2214 Hertz     8.58048 oct [G4]<br/> 10: 408.7899 Hertz     8.64385 oct [G#4]<br/> 11: 418.6009 Hertz     8.67807 oct [Ab4]<br/> 12: 437.3988 Hertz     8.74144 oct [A4]<br/> 13: 457.0410 Hertz     8.80482 oct [A#4]<br/> 14: 468.0100 Hertz     8.83903 oct [Bb4]<br/> 15: 489.0268 Hertz     8.90241 oct [B4]<br/> 16: 523.2511 Hertz     9.00000 oct [C4]</p><p>Here&apos;s a Scala file for this same scale, which you could use with<br/>Scala to tune some sythesizers or the like automatically, as I<br/>understand, or to do various kinds of analysis:</p><p>! meanquar_16.scl<br/>!<br/>1/4-comma mean-tone scale with split C#/Db, D#/Eb, G#/Ab and A#/Bb<br/> 16<br/>!<br/> 76.04900<br/> 117.10900<br/> 193.15700<br/> 269.20600<br/> 310.26500<br/> 5/4<br/> 503.42200<br/> 579.47100<br/> 696.57800<br/> 25/16<br/> 8/5<br/> 889.73500<br/> 965.78400<br/> 1006.84300<br/> 1082.89200<br/> 2/1</p><p>This scheme splits all the usual accidentals into two parts except for<br/>F#/Gb (only the standard F# included), and I&apos;d agree with the author<br/>of this file that A# seems at least as common as Gb in the<br/>experimental 16th-century music I&apos;ve seen.</p><p>By the way, I&apos;ve played 16th-century European music and improvised in<br/>related styles on a synthesizer with two independently tuned keyboards<br/>to obtain between 13 and 24 notes per octave in 1/4-comma meantone.<br/>One arrangement popular in Naples around 1600 was a 19-note instrument<br/>(Gb-A#), and Scala has a number of files in 1/4-comma meantone for<br/>differing numbers of notes per octave.</p><p>With 24 notes on two keyboards, you get a subset of Vicentino&apos;s<br/>archicembalo with its 31-note meantone cycle. The keyboards differ by<br/>Vicentino&apos;s &quot;diesis&quot; or fifthtone, often 128:125 or ~41.06 cents in<br/>1/4-comma meantone (the distance between G# on the lower keyboard and<br/>Ab on the higher one, for example).</p><p>Note that while Vicentino considers his tuning to divide the<br/>whole-tone into five equal parts, he also appears to consider the<br/>major thirds &quot;perfect&quot; or pure -- two characteristics which it was<br/>shown by the later 17th century actually define two different<br/>tunings, 31-tone equal temperament (31-tET) and 1/4-comma meantone.<br/>In practice, variations in tuning by ear might be greater than the<br/>theoretical difference between these two tunings, both of which<br/>circulate nicely in 31 notes.</p><p>Also, while Vicentino himself noted that every interval was available<br/>in his 31-note cycle from every note on the instrument, circularity<br/>wasn&apos;t an important factor in even experimental 16th-century keyboard<br/>music, although a few pieces (e.g. a puzzle piece for voices by<br/>Willaert) may suggest such a closed system. In 1618, Fabio Colonna did<br/>publish an &quot;example of circulation&quot; going through a cycle of 31 fifths<br/>on his superharpsichord, somewhat similar to Vicentino&apos;s but with a<br/>different keyboard layout, the _Sambuca Lincea_.</p><p>May I invite any further questions either on the List or via e-mail,<br/>and wish you happy tuning and playing, and Happy New Year -- now that<br/>we can discuss &quot;21st-century music&quot; very concretely and unequivocally.</p><p>Most respectfully,</p><p>Margo Schulter<br/><a href="mailto:mschulter@value.net">mschulter@value.net</a></p></div>
