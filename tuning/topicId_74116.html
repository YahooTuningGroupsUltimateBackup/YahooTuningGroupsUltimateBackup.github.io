While<br/>I have tried to keep my personal temperament even tempered, some are more<br/>explosive.  Specifically, there are those who have wolves in their<br/>personalities.</p><p>Some, like Margo, seem to use wolves only in music.  One rarely meets<br/>(through the Internet, because we have never actually met) someone who has<br/>apparently domesticated all their wolves.</p><p>Some like Paul, have their wolves pop out when inappropriate, usually<br/>regretted, if not forgotten.  Remember, many read this List.  But  screaming &quot;Man&quot;<br/>to Margo when she is only quoting a list on Scala is  problematic.  So is<br/>regularly putting me down for having some numbers on a  dead tuning that are no<br/>more than a few cents off from perfection.</p><p>Paul: Not that I think it is<br/>important audibly, it just keeps you from  starting down that slippery<br/>slope which leads to really wanky values like  Johnny gave us.</p><p>Johnny:  I don&apos;t know where those first numbers came  from.  It seems no one<br/>has gotten numbers directly from the copperplate  monochord of Werckmeister&apos;s.<br/> So, it is all second hand. And guess  what?  This is what the List is for.</p><p>As for Wiki, I usually mistrust it, although I am most happy that WIV is<br/>correct on Wiki (fingers crossed).  What is really wanky is a person&apos;s<br/>temperament that makes it difficult to explore new things.  No one wants to  rehash<br/>anything here.  As for my wanky WIV numbers, I am please to report  that we have<br/>recrunched all the numbers and can now proceed.</p><p>Tom also offers so much on this List.  I am grateful for the  information he<br/>provides.  But when I get to the last sentence of his  article on Fischer<br/>(whom I have never had an opportunity to hear, or to see), he  decides to end in a<br/>snide fashion, unnecessarily mean.  It is not a joke to  me, or anyone else,<br/>to impugn professional performances because of an  exploration into numbers.</p><p>For the record, I am not a numbers person.  I have to determine a  final on<br/>those tunings I am interested in for various personal reasons.   Maybe, if I<br/>found a piece that begs to be performed in WIV or WV or WVI I would  proceed.<br/>Until then, my record should be secure for the successes the AFMM  has had in<br/>many different tunings.</p><p>Some look down upon musicians.  Occasionally, Carl demonstrates a  bigotry<br/>that is uncalled for in this regard.  While people on this list  thrust about,<br/>Peter Serkin, Ton Koopman, Mitsuko Uchida, and Johnny Reinhard  have chosen<br/>particular tunings for particular music.  Without the  performances there would<br/>be nothing but monk like research, unavailable to the  world at large.</p><p>Once again, this post does not require any actual responses.  But<br/>temperament starts in the person.  Temperamental is usually reserved for  the creative<br/>artists.  And creativity is what gets trounced every time  someone poopoos new<br/>approaches, whether by Brad or by Charles.</p><p>I don&apos;t want to lose any of you on this List, but can&apos;t use guys modify  your<br/>temperaments, at least while posting internationally?  I&apos;m sure, SURE,<br/>others feel similarly.</p><p>best, Johnny</p><p>************************************** See what&apos;s new at <a href="http://www.aol.com">http://www.aol.com</a></p></div><h3><a id=74118 href="#74118">ðŸ”—</a>Paul Poletti &#x3C;paul@polettipiano.com&#x3E;</h3><span>10/28/2007 8:50:36 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, Afmmjr@... wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Before continuing on the List, it is important to take a look<br/>around.

Werckmeister was a master  tuner.  He could teach<br/>the use of the monochord and then tune without  it.  He could tune WIII in 15<br/>minutes flat, and says so.   Werckmeister, no doubt stunned by the dull wave to<br/>follow his publication,  generally speaking, sought to appeal to all sides, a<br/>good politician, one who  intends to survive.  He spoke of ET as a<br/>pedagogical approach for those of  less tuning ability.  It was never his ideal.  And<br/>yes, Kirnberger  could tune, too.
