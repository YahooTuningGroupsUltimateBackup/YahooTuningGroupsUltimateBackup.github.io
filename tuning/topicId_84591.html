[Marcel:]<br/>&gt; Just intonation has the following structure.<br/>&gt; It&apos;s an endless chain of major chords connected by pure fifths.<br/>&gt; so for instance 16/9 10/9 4/3 5/3 1/1 5/4 3/2 15/8 9/8 45/32 27/16<br/>&gt; etc etc<br/>&gt; (there is never a 5/4 on a 5/4 third so no 25/x intervals ever)</p><p>Actually, just-intonation implies the theoretically _infinite_<br/>planar lattice of pitches with factors of 3 and 5 (and also 2,<br/>which is generally ignored as the ratio of octave-equivalence).</p><p>Of course in practice one must find a way to limit the number<br/>of pitches, and there have been various schemes for this,<br/>of which yours described here is one.</p><p>What you are describing is a very simple subset lattice<br/>which forms the core of the theoretically infinite<br/>5-limit just-intonation lattice.</p><p>... in the rectangular geometry which is better at showing<br/>the prime axes of 3 and 5:</p><p>10:9 --- 5:3 --- 5:4 -- 15:8 -- 45:32<br/>  |       |       |       |       |<br/>  |       |       |       |       |<br/>16:9 --- 4:3 --- 1:1 --- 3:2 --- 9:8 -- 27:16</p><p>... or in the triangular geometry which is better at showing<br/>the major and minor triads:</p><p>    10:9 --- 5:3 --- 5:4 -- 15:8 -- 45:32<br/>     / \     / \     / \     / \     / \<br/>    /   \   /   \   /   \   /   \   /   \<br/>   /     \ /     \ /     \ /     \ /     \<br/>16:9 --- 4:3 --- 1:1 --- 3:2 --- 9:8 -- 27:16</p><p>&gt; [Marcel:]<br/>&gt; There is Major tonality in here and Minor tonality.<br/>&gt; Major tonality is when the fundamental bass is on 1/1 or<br/>&gt; any fifth connected to it.<br/>&gt; In major tonality the major chord is 1/1 5/4 3/2,<br/>&gt; the minor chord is 1/1 1215/1024 3/2</p><p>&gt; Minor tonality is when the fundamental bass is on 5/4 or<br/>&gt; any fifth connected to it.<br/>&gt; In minor tonality the major chord is 1/1 512/405 3/2,<br/>&gt; the minor chord is 1/1 6/5 3/2</p><p>What you&apos;re describing here is a form of diaschismatic tuning,<br/>in which you extend the two rows of the lattice so that they<br/>include &quot;diaschismatic equivalents&quot;, which actually should have<br/>a different notation from the notes they are approximating:<br/>thus to analyze the variable sizes of 3rds in your triads,<br/>using the &quot;root&quot; of the chord as zero cents in all cases,<br/>and my HEWM notation for the accidentals to the letter-names:</p><p>&gt; In major tonality the major chord is 1/1 5/4 3/2,</p><p>C:E-:G = 0:386:702 cents</p><p>&gt; the minor chord is 1/1 1215/1024 3/2</p><p>C:D#-:G = 0:296:702 cents</p><p>&gt; In minor tonality the major chord is 1/1 512/405 3/2,</p><p>E-:Ab:B- = 0:406:702 cents</p><p>&gt; the minor chord is 1/1 6/5 3/2</p><p>E-:G:B- = 0:316:702 cents</p><p>The best way to illustrate my point is to use two lattices,<br/>one each for your &quot;major tonality&quot; and &quot;minor tonality&quot;,<br/>which have respectively C and E- as 1:1 ... i realize that<br/>there should only be two rows to each lattice, but i<br/>include a third row on each one, to illustrate the &quot;implied&quot;<br/>just minor-3rds and major-3rds (Eb+ and G#--):</p><p>(normally i would put the 3-axis horizontally and the<br/>5-axis vertically;

Normally,<br/>schismatic substitution is invoked because a pythagorean<br/>chain has &quot;schismatic equivalents&quot; which are only ~2 cents<br/>away from the _just_ 3rds. Here, you&apos;re using schismatic<br/>substitutions for _pythagorean_ 3rds, which seems pointless<br/>to me, because you could just use an ordinary pythagorean<br/>tuning and achieve the same audible results.</p><p>PS - Thanks to your post, i&apos;ve just made a comprehensive and<br/>long-needed update to my Encylopedia page on just-intonation:</p><p><a href="http://tonalsoft.com/enc/j/just.aspx">http://tonalsoft.com/enc/j/just.aspx</a></p><p>-monz<br/><a href="http://tonalsoft.com/tonescape.aspx">http://tonalsoft.com/tonescape.aspx</a><br/>Tonescape microtonal music software</p></div><h3><a id=84705 href="#84705">ðŸ”—</a>joemonz &#x3C;joemonz@...&#x3E;</h3><span>9/17/2009 3:34:09 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;monz&quot; &lt;joemonz@...&gt; wrote:</p><p>&gt; Sorry to &quot;rain on your parade&quot;, but these all seems to me<br/>&gt; to be complicated for nothing.
