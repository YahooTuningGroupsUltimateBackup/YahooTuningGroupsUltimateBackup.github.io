This is now at the point<br/>&gt; where it needs an article explaining it.  Exactly how where these two<br/>&gt; versions tuned?<br/>&gt; -Carl</p><p>Thanks for listening!  My theories about dynamic retuning are actually<br/>partially in flux as a result of hearing this piece.  It is retuned in<br/>an absolutely brutal fashion, with one moment caring nothing about<br/>another even if the tuning of a sounding note shifts radically on the<br/>fly; and retunings take place instantly instead of gradually. The sudden<br/>tuning shifts are evidently partially masked by newly sounding notes.<br/>My methods need to calculate a &quot;pain reduction factor&quot; based upon how<br/>much of the sound at a given moment is from notes newly sounding.</p><p>The tuning specification files are nothing more than a bend set and a<br/>numerical rating of the desirability of each of the intervals formed,<br/>which I&apos;ve pulled out of the air over time.  Each tuning is assumed<br/>applicable in any of 12 keys.  I tuned the 5-limit dom7 7th to 16/9 of<br/>root rather than 9/5, but in all honesty I don&apos;t listen to the 5-limit<br/>version, I like the Sweet Sound of Seven so much!</p><p>Many other sequences sound just awful when retuned in this brutal<br/>fashion, but I&apos;m poised to dig into the heart of fixing up the glitchy<br/>places.  There&apos;s a LOT of wonderful sound yet to come, I&apos;m convinced!!</p><p>JIRelay has not yet advanced, but it shares 90% or more of the code in<br/>the project I&apos;m working on.  I hope to have an interesting version<br/>available by the end of the year.</p><p>JdL</p></div><h3><a id=5175 href="#5175">ðŸ”—</a>John A. deLaubenfels &#x3C;jadl@xxxxxx.xxxx&#x3E;</h3><span>9/30/1999 7:53:46 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>[Rick McGowan, TD 335.14:]<br/>&gt; Thanks to John deLaubenfels for offering JIRelay... For some years<br/>&gt; I&apos;ve  heard about adaptive tuning.  I tried out JIRelay a little bit,<br/>&gt; and listened  to some of the Beethoven.  This adaptive tuning is<br/>&gt; really interesting... I&apos;d  encourage John to keep hacking at this<br/>&gt; program.</p><p>&gt; I also wonder if John could provide some kind of more detailed<br/>&gt; algorithmic  description of what the program is doing, and guidelines<br/>&gt; for making &quot;.tux&quot; files?</p><p>&gt; Is there any on-line resource for more information on adaptive tuning?</p><p>Some recent posts that address at least the basics of your questions:</p><p>   TD 333.9 describes how to use JI Relay and includes an example<br/>            5-limit tuning file.<br/>   TD 332.7 includes a 7-limit utonal tuning file.<br/>   TD 330.7 includes a 7-limit otonal tuning file, along with a<br/>            description of how the tuning files are constructed.<br/>   TD 326.7 describes how Project Retune decides what tuning to use.</p><p>Have you seen all of these?  Are they clear?  Are you looking for more<br/>detail?  Are you looking to write your own program (this I encourage!).</p><p>As for on-line resources for adaptive tuning, I can&apos;t think of any that<br/>I&apos;m aware of - does anyone else know of any?  When it comes to these<br/>kinds of games, it&apos;s a small world, after all...</p><p>JdL</p></div>
