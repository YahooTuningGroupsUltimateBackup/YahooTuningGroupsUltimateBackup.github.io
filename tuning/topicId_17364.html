A while back I was told<br/>I shouldn&apos;t discuss it with anybody in case it could be patented and I&apos;ve<br/>been paralyzed by that thought for a while, but after talking to patent<br/>lawyers and doing research on my own it looks pretty hopeless for a lone<br/>individual to get a software patent that will hold up in court anyway.  So<br/>I&apos;ve decided to &quot;go public&quot; on the list as a way of contributing to something<br/>that has been instrumental in its conception.  I&apos;m also looking for some<br/>feedback on the design as I&apos;m at a critical stage in it&apos;s development.</p><p>After struggling to get microtones out of software that wasn&apos;t designed for<br/>them and then trying to annotate the scores afterwards, in a notation system<br/>that wasn&apos;t designed for them either, I said to myself &quot;There&apos;s got to be a<br/>better way.&quot;  Drawing on some misguided attempts to get me into the<br/>financially fulfilling field of engineering I started exploring the<br/>customization capabilities of a popular drafting program called AutoCAD and<br/>discovered that if I put a little time into  it, the program had enormous<br/>potential as a music composition tool.  That was a year ago.</p><p>To date I&apos;ve got a functioning (but extremely slow) Visual Basic version of<br/>it running and I&apos;m now going to be recoding it in C++ so this is a prime time<br/>to make design changes.</p><p>Jumping right into the details, here&apos;s a brief description of how I&apos;ve got it<br/>set up in the Visual Basic implementation:</p><p>       In three dimensional space I&apos;m using the X-axis  to represent time,<br/>the Y-axis to represent frequency and the Z-axis to represent everything else<br/>(amplitude, pan, other controllers, the list goes on....).  On the X-axis<br/>time is measured in MIDI ticks with one AutoCAD unit equaling one tick and<br/>the origin representing the start of time (384 ticks per quarter is assumed).<br/> On the Y-axis pitch is represented linearly with one AutoCAD unit equaling<br/>one cent and the origin representing note zero of the MIDI standard&apos;s 128<br/>possible notes (microtonality is achieved through pitch-bends and the<br/>assumption is made that all of the 128 notes are tuned to 12et).  On the<br/>Z-axis articulations are measured in MIDI controller units with four AutoCAD<br/>units equaling one MIDI controller unit (range 0 to 127).<br/>For example:<br/>In the AutoCAD environment a line from point (0, 10, 0) to point (384, 1210,<br/>0) would represent the lowest note in the MIDI standard + 10 cents being bent<br/>up an 8va starting on beat one and ending on beat two.  For a volume change<br/>to that note another line would be drawn from point (0, 10, 0) to point (384,<br/>10, 511) and would represent a change from it&apos;s minimum volume to its maximum<br/>volume.<br/>       I&apos;ve set the track system up using AutoCAD&apos;s layers.  (Think of layers<br/>as clear plastic sheets that are layed on top of each other).  I designated<br/>15 layers for MIDI channels 1-9 and 11-16.  So if you wanted to put the<br/>example note on channel one then you would make AutoCAD &quot;Layer One&quot; the<br/>current input layer before drawing the note.</p><p>A few pros + cons of the VB implementation:<br/>- It is very slow.  (Five minutes of complex music takes roughly an hour to<br/>generate)<br/>- It is very expensive.  (AutoCAD 2000i goes for around $3k)<br/>+ There is a free viewer that lets you view the CAD files.<br/>+ Precise annotation is as easy as drawing dimensions and can be automated.<br/>- Musicians don&apos;t read music the way I&apos;ve represented it.<br/>+ Layerability lets you view tracks superimposed on each other without<br/>clutter.<br/>- Due to the fact that I&apos;m using pitch bends to tune the notes, 15 channels<br/>is limiting.<br/>- Pitch bends aren&apos;t always accurate.<br/>+ Continuous control messages can be created with precision and large amounts<br/>of data can be created with a small number of input points.<br/>+ It is fully microtonal.  (You can draw a note line anywhere in the MIDI<br/>note range).<br/>- The layer/channel scheme sucks for input.  (If you want to draw a four note<br/>non-12et chord you have to change layers four times).<br/>+ Untrained musicians dig it.  (They love just drawing lines and hearing<br/>music come out of it, no notation to deal with.)</p><p>So that&apos;s the gist of it.  Keep in mind that this is a prototype.  There is<br/>alot more that can be done and since I&apos;m going to rewrite the whole thing<br/>anyway I thought I&apos;d run it by y&apos;all and see what comes of it.</p><p>....and my parents thought I was going to move to Hollywood and become a<br/>film-composer,</p><p>Andy</p></div><h3>Dave Keenan &#x3C;D.KEENAN@UQ.NET.AU&#x3E;</h3><span>2/4/2001 3:56:21 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p><a href="http://groups.yahoo.com/group/tuning/message/17364">http://groups.yahoo.com/group/tuning/message/17364</a></p><p>Hey Andy!</p><p>This is a great idea.
