Among<br/>&gt; whichn: what we<br/>&gt; call an &quot;inversion&quot; isn&apos;t that at all, maybe a permutation or<br/>&gt; something,<br/>&gt; but only one of those things is really an upside-down arrangement.<br/>And<br/>&gt; modulation? I believe &quot;modulation&quot; and &quot;Mode&quot; have the same<br/>&gt; root in which<br/>&gt; case, a change of key ain&apos;t no modulation. Pick your own from<br/>&gt; there. &lt;grin&gt;<br/>&gt;  At 07:06 PM 6/29/02 -0400, you wrote:<br/>&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt; Everyone seems to be objecting to the word &quot;atonal&quot;. . . but<br/>&gt;&gt; what about<br/>&gt;&gt; the word &quot;tonal&quot;?<br/>&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt; So Western Classical Music before 1910 (and after 1500 or<br/>&gt;&gt; whenever) is the<br/>&gt;&gt; only music written with &quot;tones&quot;?</p><p>Well said, Jay !</p><p>Modulate and Mode both originate in the Latin &apos;modus&apos;, meaning<br/>measure. So yes, a change of key is not modulation. As for<br/>&apos;inversion&apos;, you&apos;re right. Permutation is indeed much more<br/>accurate and appropriate. An inversion is but one permutation.</p><p>Much of the common use language and theory in music is tainted<br/>by the conception of 12-ED2:1 as the one truth, remarkable<br/>narrowness of mainstream musical thought, and the accumulated<br/>misconceptions and fallacies  . Far more complex and larger<br/>issues continue to be routinely fudged to fit into the 12-ED2:1<br/>view of music.</p><p>The current common notion of &apos;tonal music&apos; is flawed by it&apos;s<br/>myopic 12-ED2:1, major/minor foundations. In this context<br/>&apos;tonal&apos; is supposed to refer to the tonality of a piece of<br/>music, well all music is inextricably tonal.</p><p>Tonality is the relationship between the notes of a scale. A<br/>scale is the set of all the notes in a system of music in an<br/>ascending or descending order. Incidentally, recently there was<br/>argument over what a &apos;set&apos; is. Mark Gould was right when he<br/>said, &apos;What else is an ordered sequence of pitches but a set?&apos;.<br/>There&apos;s a lot of nonsense out there about a supposed, &apos;pre-tonal<br/>period&apos; in music.</p><p>- Joel<br/>_____________________________________________________</p><p>Jay and Joel,</p><p>Until I read this exchange between the two of you I was feeling like a moron on musical concepts and the associated terms. As a pedestrian I welcome the simple argument &quot;..., well all music is inextricably tonal.&quot;. Then could some one, or anyone please explain to me the difference between TONAL music and MODAL music. I would appreciate very much if the discourse could be in a style &quot;for idiots&quot;.</p><p>Can Akkoc</p><p>---------------------------------<br/>Do You Yahoo!?<br/>New! SBC Yahoo!
