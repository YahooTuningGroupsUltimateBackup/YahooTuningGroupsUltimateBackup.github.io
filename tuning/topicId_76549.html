Just to better<br/>&gt; understand you message I try to summarise. C-Thru Music AXiS can be<br/>&gt; freely tuned, because you can split the 192 into 3 MIDI channels (a<br/>&gt; 64 keys): you would simply tune three MIDI sound generators according<br/>&gt; needs. Great!<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Now, the biggest question for me remains: what are suitable key<br/>&gt; mappings? You mention a Bosanquet mapping and a &quot;harmonic table&quot;<br/>&gt; layout.

For $2100,<br/>&gt; &gt; including shipping and flight case, you too can have a<br/>&gt; &gt; 192-note MIDI controller with velocity-sensing keys (unlike<br/>&gt; &gt; the Tonal Plexus)! That&apos;s over 6 octaves of 31-tone equal<br/>&gt; &gt; temperament, and almost 5 octaves of 41-ET. Not ideal but<br/>&gt; &gt; let&apos;s remember Western music was built out by guys like<br/>&gt; &gt; Byrd who played a lot of 3-octave virginals.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; The AXiS has 192 isomorphically-arranged velocity-sensing<br/>&gt; &gt; keyswitches that can be split into 3 zones of 64 MIDI notes<br/>&gt; &gt; each. This means all you need is to run three instances of<br/>&gt; &gt; a synth like Pianoteq (which is just blowing my mind... I<br/>&gt; &gt; could live the rest of my life and never want another<br/>&gt; &gt; synth... by the way re. an earlier thread it works great<br/>&gt; &gt; with &gt; 12 notes per octave). The only hitch is, you will<br/>&gt; &gt; need three .scl files for each tuning (one for each keyboard<br/>&gt; &gt; zone, unless your tuning happens to be periodic every 64<br/>&gt; &gt; notes). This is a bit of a pain but nothing out of the line<br/>&gt; &gt; of duty for the average MIDI musician.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; If your pocketbook is a bit deeper, you can get an Opal<br/>&gt; &gt; Keyboard. One of the creators of the AXiS broke away from<br/>&gt; &gt; C-Thru Music and created this company. They&apos;re using the<br/>&gt; &gt; same size and shape of keys and layout as the AXiS, but use<br/>&gt; &gt; nice woods to build their enclosures and... CLAIM TO HAVE<br/>&gt; &gt; WEIGHTED KEYS. The price is approximately $1500 more than<br/>&gt; &gt; the AXiS.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; On either instrument the keys are arranged in 21 columns.<br/>&gt; &gt; This means it&apos;s going to give you &lt; 2 octaves with the usual<br/>&gt; &gt; 12-row Bosanquet mapping. However, it&apos;s perfectly possible<br/>&gt; &gt; to do Bosanquet-like mappings with 7 columns (3 octaves on<br/>&gt; &gt; the AXiS) or 5 columns (4 octaves). However the most<br/>&gt; &gt; natural way to map to the AXiS will probably be with<br/>&gt; &gt; something that is closer to the &quot;harmonic table&quot; layout it<br/>&gt; &gt; was designed for.

It was discussed here in 2005<br/>&gt; &gt; already.  But it wasn&apos;t designed for microtonal music, and<br/>&gt; &gt; it wasn&apos;t clear how well it would work.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; Well I&apos;m happy to report that it should work (thanks to<br/>&gt; &gt; their very responsive and knowledgeable staff).  For $2100,<br/>&gt; &gt; including shipping and flight case, you too can have a<br/>&gt; &gt; 192-note MIDI controller with velocity-sensing keys (unlike<br/>&gt; &gt; the Tonal Plexus)!  That&apos;s over 6 octaves of 31-tone equal<br/>&gt; &gt; temperament, and almost 5 octaves of 41-ET.  Not ideal but<br/>&gt; &gt; let&apos;s remember Western music was built out by guys like<br/>&gt; &gt; Byrd who played a lot of 3-octave virginals.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; The AXiS has 192 isomorphically-arranged velocity-sensing<br/>&gt; &gt; keyswitches that can be split into 3 zones of 64 MIDI notes<br/>&gt; &gt; each.  This means all you need is to run three instances of<br/>&gt; &gt; a synth like Pianoteq (which is just blowing my mind... I<br/>&gt; &gt; could live the rest of my life and never want another<br/>&gt; &gt; synth... by the way re. an earlier thread it works great<br/>&gt; &gt; with &gt; 12 notes per octave).  The only hitch is, you will<br/>&gt; &gt; need three .scl files for each tuning (one for each keyboard<br/>&gt; &gt; zone, unless your tuning happens to be periodic every 64<br/>&gt; &gt; notes).  This is a bit of a pain but nothing out of the line<br/>&gt; &gt; of duty for the average MIDI musician.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; If your pocketbook is a bit deeper, you can get an Opal<br/>&gt; &gt; Keyboard.  One of the creators of the AXiS broke away from<br/>&gt; &gt; C-Thru Music and created this company.  They&apos;re using the<br/>&gt; &gt; same size and shape of keys and layout as the AXiS, but use<br/>&gt; &gt; nice woods to build their enclosures and... CLAIM TO HAVE<br/>&gt; &gt; WEIGHTED KEYS.  The price is approximately $1500 more than<br/>&gt; &gt; the AXiS.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; On either instrument the keys are arranged in 21 columns.<br/>&gt; &gt; This means it&apos;s going to give you &lt; 2 octaves with the usual<br/>&gt; &gt; 12-row Bosanquet mapping.  However, it&apos;s perfectly possible<br/>&gt; &gt; to do Bosanquet-like mappings with 7 columns (3 octaves on<br/>&gt; &gt; the AXiS) or 5 columns (4 octaves).  However the most<br/>&gt; &gt; natural way to map to the AXiS will probably be with<br/>&gt; &gt; something that is closer to the &quot;harmonic table&quot; layout it<br/>&gt; &gt; was designed for.  Bill Wesley&apos;s &quot;array&quot; music proves such<br/>&gt; &gt; layouts are cool.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; I was going to wait to post this until I had a chance to<br/>&gt; &gt; play the AXiS and/or Opal, but I couldn&apos;t wait.  That means<br/>&gt; &gt; it&apos;s perfectly possible that the actions suck.  Both<br/>&gt; &gt; companies claim they&apos;ll refund your money if you don&apos;t like<br/>&gt; &gt; their product.

Just to better<br/>&gt; understand you message I try to summarise. C-Thru Music AXiS can be<br/>&gt; freely tuned, because you can split the 192 into 3 MIDI channels (a<br/>&gt; 64 keys): you would simply tune three MIDI sound generators<br/>&gt; according needs. Great!</p><p>Yup.</p><p>&gt; Now, the biggest question for me remains: what are suitable key<br/>&gt; mappings?</p><p>Sky&apos;s the limit!  Well that, and the 21-column limit.  :)</p><p>&gt; You mention a Bosanquet mapping and a &quot;harmonic table&quot;<br/>&gt; layout. Could you be more specific about the latter?</p><p>See their website for info on the harmonic table.  The idea<br/>is to make consonances short on the keyboard and give up<br/>a left-right ascending pitch axis.  Some concertinas work<br/>like this.  You could argue there are too many runs in Byrd.</p><p>-Carl</p></div><h3><a id=76566 href="#76566">ðŸ”—</a>Aaron Wolf &#x3C;wolftune@...&#x3E;</h3><span>5/24/2008 6:15:38 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Kraig,</p><p>Of course you can set up any scale at all in a hex keyboard, but that<br/>doesn&apos;t mean it will make logical sense or be reasonable to remember<br/>what is where.

The Tonal Plexus allows that, although<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; tempered. But I can set up a tuning table for it that makes it all<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; pure JI for a very extended JI with a set tonal center. And this<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; compromise may be eliminated if H-Pi implements my request that they<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; agreed is worthwhile: an adaptive algorithm unlike typical ones, just<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; adaptive to eliminate the up-to-3-cent error of the 205ET temperament.<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; With that adaption added, the TPX will be nearly ideal in my mind, as<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; far as layout at least.<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; -Aaron Wolf<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; --- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a> &lt;mailto:tuning%<a href="http://40yahoogroups.com">40yahoogroups.com</a>&gt; &gt; &lt;mailto:tuning%<a href="http://40yahoogroups.com">40yahoogroups.com</a>&gt;,<br/>&gt; Kraig<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; Grady &lt;kraiggrady@&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; i have never had a problem mapping 7 or 11 to a hexagonal layout 7<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; especially as they can be only two ranks up. the 11 you can map<br/>&gt; either<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; above or below.<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I think Xenharmonikon 3 covers all types of such animals mapped<br/>&gt; pretty<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; easily.

Just to better<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; understand you message I try to summarise. C-Thru Music AXiS can be<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; freely tuned, because you can split the 192 into 3 MIDI channels (a<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; 64 keys): you would simply tune three MIDI sound generators<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; according needs.

Well that, and the 21-column limit. :)<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; You mention a Bosanquet mapping and a &quot;harmonic table&quot;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; layout. Could you be more specific about the latter?<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; See their website for info on the harmonic table. The idea<br/>&gt; &gt; is to make consonances short on the keyboard and give up<br/>&gt; &gt; a left-right ascending pitch axis. Some concertinas work<br/>&gt; &gt; like this.

There&apos;s an underlying<br/>notion that more notes = more cognitive load.  That&apos;s all I<br/>was trying to say.

This would be advantageous of temperaments. but one want a<br/>&gt; &gt; whole slew of timbres to use, in fact timbre is often more important<br/>&gt; &gt; than pitch in say pop music.<br/>&gt; &gt; do i want a tuning where my flute sounds sound wrong and my gongs<br/>&gt; &gt; correct, at this point i don&apos;t think i would be concerning my self much<br/>&gt; &gt; with pitch, cause the stronger it was the worse it would sound.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; /^_,&apos;,&apos;,&apos;,_ //^ /Kraig Grady_ ^_,&apos;,&apos;,&apos;,_<br/>&gt; &gt; _&apos;&apos;&apos;&apos;&apos;&apos;&apos;_ ^North/Western Hemisphere:<br/>&gt; &gt; North American Embassy of Anaphoria Island &lt;<a href="http://anaphoria.com/">http://anaphoria.com/</a> &gt; &lt;<a href="http://anaphoria.com/">http://anaphoria.com/</a>&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; _&apos;&apos;&apos;&apos;&apos;&apos;&apos;_ ^South/Eastern Hemisphere:<br/>&gt; &gt; Austronesian Outpost of Anaphoria &gt; &lt;<a href="http://anaphoriasouth.blogspot.com/">http://anaphoriasouth.blogspot.com/</a> &gt; &lt;<a href="http://anaphoriasouth.blogspot.com/">http://anaphoriasouth.blogspot.com/</a>&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &apos;,&apos;,&apos;,&apos;,&apos;,&apos;,&apos;,&apos;,&apos;,&apos;,&apos;,&apos;,&apos;,&apos;,&apos;,&apos;,&apos;,&apos;,&apos;,&apos;,&apos;,&apos;,&apos;,&apos;,&apos;,&apos;,&apos;,&apos;,&apos;,<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; Aaron Wolf wrote:<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; Kraig,<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; Of course you can set up any scale at all in a hex keyboard, but that<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; doesn&apos;t mean it will make logical sense or be reasonable to remember<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; what is where.

However, I do appreciate the<br/>resolution in some ways.</p><p>My request for H-Pi, as mentioned in other posts is to create an<br/>algorithm that does adaptive tuning to create pure JI intervals within<br/>the specification of the 205ET unit.  By having 205ET as the base, any<br/>interval could be played without vagueness or multiple options.  So<br/>for instance, I could play even my example of 14/9 versus 25/16 and<br/>have the algorithm make either interval pure, and there&apos;s no need for<br/>the way most algorithms work which would need some way to determine<br/>which interval I want or always choose one of the two.  By specifying<br/>which 205ET key I want, it would only have one option.  Anyway, Mr.<br/>Hunt agreed with me on the value of this suggestion and expressed<br/>clear goals of implementing it.  So if this is done, then the issues<br/>of 205ET versus 72Et or others in terms of how close they are to JI<br/>for particular limits would be irrelevant.</p><p>&gt; All of that said, the Tonal Plexus certainly is an exciting<br/>&gt; instrument with eons of musical potential and you&apos;re a very<br/>&gt; talented musician, so that&apos;s a good fit.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; -Carl<br/>&gt;</p><p>Thanks for the positive note.  My interest is not only in playing but<br/>in teaching, and there exist substantial and historical aspects to how<br/>Mr. Hunt&apos;s theory and layout can help visually explain things to<br/>students, just like how guitarists and singers are often taught to<br/>understand scale terminology in relation to the piano layout.  In this<br/>case, I get the piano layout, it is compatible with traditional<br/>teaching but extended to understand the real nature of pitch.</p><p>And as for performance, I appreciate that the layout allows easy<br/>access to an approximation of 12ET for any time I&apos;d need to relate to<br/>tempered musicians.  As I said, the same conceptual layout might work<br/>for me in 72ET, though I&apos;m not sure that over all that would be any<br/>better, just different.</p><p>Best,<br/>Aaron</p></div><h3><a id=76589 href="#76589">ðŸ”—</a>Aaron Wolf &#x3C;wolftune@...&#x3E;</h3><span>5/24/2008 9:49:18 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, Kraig Grady &lt;kraiggrady@...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; So what is it you are working with these days.

There&apos;s an underlying<br/>&gt; notion that more notes = more cognitive load.  That&apos;s all I<br/>&gt; was trying to say.  Now you may say that the organization<br/>&gt; of the Plexus makes those extra notes easy as can be.

It is of artistic use to create<br/>cognitive load.  I totally disagree with your statement about getting<br/>as many consonances as possible.  That is only one end of things.  The<br/>goal is to have as much range as possible between dissonance and<br/>consonance, cognitively and acoustically.  By having access to very<br/>strong consonance, very strong dissonance, and everything in between,<br/>the artist is free to manipulate tension and resolve in whatever<br/>manners fit the desired expression.</p><p>-AW</p></div><h3><a id=76591 href="#76591">ðŸ”—</a>Aaron Wolf &#x3C;wolftune@...&#x3E;</h3><span>5/24/2008 10:02:48 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;Carl Lumma&quot; &lt;carl@...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; --- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;Aaron Wolf&quot; &lt;wolftune@&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I readily agree that hex also has its own<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; particular benefits as well, but if I have only one, I<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; prefer the Hunt layout at this point.<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; How many hex keyboards have you played?<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; I haven&apos;t had one for extended time, but I played on the AXiS at the<br/>&gt; &gt; NAMM show last year.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; What did you think of the build quality, and velocity sensing?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; -Carl<br/>&gt;</p><p>First off, if you&apos;ve never been to a NAMM show, let me tell you: you<br/>can&apos;t really hear things.

What I like about the Tonal Plexus is that it<br/>has enough keys and enough resolution that a large number of<br/>theoretical ideas are all possible without planning any tuning or<br/>arrangement in advance.  In that regard, I can freely explore without<br/>constant mental reference to theory.  Considering the cognition of<br/>music, I can draw upon whatever parameter I want to explore in the<br/>moment - such as having a sharper leading tone just for the extra<br/>&quot;leading&quot; quality and extra dissonance before the resolve.  Or I can<br/>stick to harmonic intervals.  It&apos;s all there for me to explore.</p><p>Now, my theoretical perspective is generally toward otonal JI.  In<br/>relation to barbershop harmony, jazz harmony, even classical stuff...<br/>I like to play harmonic chords and modulate around the notes in<br/>various ways.  I am exploring the options of sustaining or repeating<br/>one part of a chord and then playing a new harmony that includes that<br/>one part but makes it a new identity, and in doing that, I can easily<br/>find myself modulating through a wide range of total notes.  I also<br/>like to explore ethnic tunings or what could be similar to ethnic<br/>tunings, which could involve even things like stretched octaves.  With<br/>205ET I can play a noticeably stretched octave that isn&apos;t horrible,<br/>which would be harder with less resolution.  My feeling is that these<br/>choices all have different affective impact on the listener, and I<br/>want access to all the different expressive choices.  That said, my<br/>preference is definitely toward solid harmony, and I intend to learn<br/>to play some extended barbershop arrangements on the keyboard.  I<br/>assume you recall hearing the Melodyne&apos;d barbershop recordings I&apos;ve<br/>shared in the past years...</p><p>Now to specifically address the tonal center question, my feeling is<br/>that cognitive sense of tonal sense is very flexible depending on some<br/>specific factors.  Being harmonically supported helps.  Playing a<br/>pitch in any resolution sense, such as on a strong beat, for a long<br/>time, even while APPEARING VISUALLY to be satisfied and relaxed, or<br/>telling people verbally that this is the destination pitch, or<br/>repeating a lot, and once again, strong harmonic support... these<br/>things all help listeners accept something as a tonal center.  And<br/>certainly, I have to admit and work with known stylistic expectations<br/>as well.  I&apos;m interested in controlling and exploring all the ways to<br/>work with these factors.</p><p>What sounds &quot;weird&quot; to most people is any time I allow them to expect<br/>something, such as diatonic notes, and then play something that is not<br/>only non-diatonic but is outside the realm of deviations that they&apos;ve<br/>stylistically learned to relate to.  The more I play from the<br/>beginning in ways that denies their previous stylistic expectations,<br/>the more they will be ready for new things.  Although I also at times<br/>might want to make them feel &quot;weird&quot; too.  All these things are the<br/>purview of an expressive, creative approach.</p><p>Please feel free to ask for any specific clarification if you&apos;re<br/>curious about my thoughts in any further detail.</p><p>Best,<br/>AW</p><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, Kraig Grady &lt;kraiggrady@...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I wasn&apos;t suggesting serialism, more the number of tonal centers.<br/>perhaps<br/>&gt; diatonic is some cyclical fashion?<br/>&gt;  i mean you are refering to some progression sounding weird to some<br/>&gt; people, are you working off of diatonicism<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; /^_,&apos;,&apos;,&apos;,_ //^ /Kraig Grady_ ^_,&apos;,&apos;,&apos;,_<br/>&gt; _&apos;&apos;&apos;&apos;&apos;&apos;&apos;_ ^North/Western Hemisphere:<br/>&gt; North American Embassy of Anaphoria Island &lt;<a href="http://anaphoria.com/">http://anaphoria.com/</a>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; _&apos;&apos;&apos;&apos;&apos;&apos;&apos;_ ^South/Eastern Hemisphere:<br/>&gt; Austronesian Outpost of Anaphoria &lt;<a href="http://anaphoriasouth.blogspot.com/">http://anaphoriasouth.blogspot.com/</a>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &apos;,&apos;,&apos;,&apos;,&apos;,&apos;,&apos;,&apos;,&apos;,&apos;,&apos;,&apos;,&apos;,&apos;,&apos;,&apos;,&apos;,&apos;,&apos;,&apos;,&apos;,&apos;,&apos;,&apos;,&apos;,&apos;,&apos;,&apos;,&apos;,<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Aaron Wolf wrote:<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; --- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a> &lt;mailto:tuning%<a href="http://40yahoogroups.com">40yahoogroups.com</a>&gt;,<br/>Kraig<br/>&gt; &gt; Grady &lt;kraiggrady@&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; So what is it you are working with these days.

There are a lot of other &quot;extended&quot; &gt; harmonies that are prevalent in jazz and later-era classical music &gt; that turn out to be just as inconsistent in 72-tet as well. Since &gt; composers often didn&apos;t have microtonal resources to work with, their &gt; solution to finding new sounds was often simply to branch out further &gt; along the 5-limit JI lattice (in a metaphorical sort of way) to &gt; &quot;extend&quot; the harmonies that they already had access to, and so these &gt; harmonies that are inconsistent in 72-tet are unfortunately relatively &gt; common.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; In fact, just to generalize, the relatively small step size of 16.667 &gt; cents means that any error over 8.333 cents will round up or down to &gt; an adjacent step, and since the error for 3/2 in 72-tet is around 2 &gt; cents, 5 stacked fifths is enough to screw up the rounding in 72-tet. &gt; The -3 cent error for 5/4 means that 3 of those stacked will be &gt; inconsistent. The same thing applies to the 7th and 11th harmonics as &gt; well.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; This in my experience makes 72-tet relatively hard to play at times. &gt; You can either abandon the consistency principle and just accept a &gt; small amount of error for the sake of easier conceptualization, which &gt; I think sounds bad and much unlike the extremely fine and &quot;pure&quot; &gt; character of 72-tet that makes it so attractive to begin with -- or &gt; you come up with some rule to adjust the harmonies, like a rule of +1 &gt; step every 5 fifths or so, which is pretty messy to think about, &gt; especially when you get into upper structure triads and higher-limit &gt; harmonies. Either way, the inconsistency of 72-tet is the deal-breaker &gt; for me, especially when you compare it to lower-division temperaments &gt; like 53-tet, or even to some degree 41-tet. But 53-tet doesn&apos;t do so &gt; well with 7-limit harmonies, and so I hate equal temperaments.

And yes, it<br/>&gt; &gt; could work with 41 or 72, and in many regards, I&apos;d be happy<br/>&gt; &gt; with that.  The result with 205 might be slightly more complex<br/>&gt; &gt; to play, but the musical results of any of these are essentially<br/>&gt; &gt; the same.  And anyway, the fact is there *is* something to<br/>&gt; &gt; Mr. Hunt&apos;s &quot;average just noticeable difference&quot; concept.  With<br/>&gt; &gt; 205, the adaptivity will be truly melodically imperceptible.<br/>&gt; &gt; That would not be the case with 41, though it wouldn&apos;t be<br/>&gt; &gt; too bad.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; The size of the adaptive tuning shifts depends on the comma(s)<br/>&gt; being tempered out by the music.  Any Western music that doesn&apos;t<br/>&gt; use 12-ET enharmonics (almost all of it written prior to the<br/>&gt; Romantic period and much of it even today) can be adaptively<br/>&gt; tuned with shifts no greater than 5 cents, which is already<br/>&gt; basically melodically imperceptible.  By the time you get to<br/>&gt; the commas of 41 it&apos;s just a total wash, so there&apos;s no benefit<br/>&gt; to going higher in that regard.<br/>&gt;</p><p>Overall, I agree with you, except in the level that you really dismiss<br/>*any* value of higher temperaments in this regard.  Fact is, with a<br/>step size of nearly 30 cents, the exact issues of how to average the<br/>harmonies... well, for instance, if I have a 3 note chord that<br/>averages sharp of the regular 41ET notes, and then another that one<br/>common pitch but averages flat... well, the amount of shift could be<br/>melodically very noticeable.</p><p>To a degree the function of higher precision is more conscious control<br/>or awareness of these things.  In other words, by using 205ET and then<br/>adapting, any larger shift would be something that would necessitate<br/>choosing a new key.  And in that regard, it allows the artist to opt<br/>for a less harmonic note if they want to avoid the melodic shift.  By<br/>having more precision, it allows the user to still access harmonic<br/>ratios well, but have the option of choosing melodic function over<br/>harmonic at times.  With 205ET, I can choose to raise a note<br/>intentionally sharp of harmonic without going so far as to make it<br/>really noticeably dissonant.  That wouldn&apos;t be possible with only 41,<br/>and not the same with 72.  These issues cannot be so easily dismissed<br/>unless you assume all pitch related choices are based on finding<br/>consonant harmony above all else.</p><p>&gt; &gt; Anyway, the first keyboard that exists that can play a decent<br/>&gt; &gt; range of 72ET with JI adaptivity within that - I would want<br/>&gt; &gt; one for sure.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; The adaptivity would best reside in the synthesizer, not<br/>&gt; the keyboard.  Using Max/MSP or any one of a number of<br/>&gt; similar packages with the AXiS (or Plexus), it should be<br/>&gt; fairly straightforward to implement.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; If it were velocity sensitive as well, that&apos;d be totally<br/>&gt; &gt; awesomely incredible.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; AXiS then.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; But again, this fantasy keyboard doesn&apos;t exist.

There are a lot of other &quot;extended&quot; harmonies that are<br/>prevalent<br/>&gt; in jazz and later-era classical music that turn out to be just as<br/>&gt; inconsistent in 72-tet as well. Since composers often didn&apos;t have<br/>microtonal<br/>&gt; resources to work with, their solution to finding new sounds was often<br/>&gt; simply to branch out further along the 5-limit JI lattice (in a<br/>metaphorical<br/>&gt; sort of way) to &quot;extend&quot; the harmonies that they already had access<br/>to, and<br/>&gt; so these harmonies that are inconsistent in 72-tet are unfortunately<br/>&gt; relatively common.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; In fact, just to generalize, the relatively small step size of<br/>16.667 cents<br/>&gt; means that any error over 8.333 cents will round up or down to an<br/>adjacent<br/>&gt; step, and since the error for 3/2 in 72-tet is around 2 cents, 5 stacked<br/>&gt; fifths is enough to screw up the rounding in 72-tet. The -3 cent<br/>error for<br/>&gt; 5/4 means that 3 of those stacked will be inconsistent. The same thing<br/>&gt; applies to the 7th and 11th harmonics as well.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; This in my experience makes 72-tet relatively hard to play at times.<br/>You can<br/>&gt; either abandon the consistency principle and just accept a small<br/>amount of<br/>&gt; error for the sake of easier conceptualization, which I think sounds<br/>bad and<br/>&gt; much unlike the extremely fine and &quot;pure&quot; character of 72-tet that<br/>makes it<br/>&gt; so attractive to begin with -- or you come up with some rule to<br/>adjust the<br/>&gt; harmonies, like a rule of +1 step every 5 fifths or so, which is pretty<br/>&gt; messy to think about, especially when you get into upper structure<br/>triads<br/>&gt; and higher-limit harmonies. Either way, the inconsistency of 72-tet<br/>is the<br/>&gt; deal-breaker for me, especially when you compare it to lower-division<br/>&gt; temperaments like 53-tet, or even to some degree 41-tet. But 53-tet<br/>doesn&apos;t<br/>&gt; do so well with 7-limit harmonies, and so I hate equal temperaments.<br/>But I<br/>&gt; love them.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; -Mike<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; On Sun, May 25, 2008 at 5:08 PM, Kraig Grady &lt;kraiggrady@...&gt;<br/>&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;   If you go to<br/>&gt; &gt; <a href="http://anaphoria.com/wilson.html">http://anaphoria.com/wilson.html</a><br/>&gt; &gt; and look under<br/>&gt; &gt; KEYBOARD DESIGNS/RELATED TO THE SCALE TREE<br/>&gt; &gt; there are quite a few mappings there along with the templates that<br/>&gt; &gt; generate them<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; /^_,&apos;,&apos;,&apos;,_ //^ /Kraig Grady_ ^_,&apos;,&apos;,&apos;,_<br/>&gt; &gt; _&apos;&apos;&apos;&apos;&apos;&apos;&apos;_ ^North/Western Hemisphere:<br/>&gt; &gt; North American Embassy of Anaphoria Island &lt;<a href="http://anaphoria.com/">http://anaphoria.com/</a>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; _&apos;&apos;&apos;&apos;&apos;&apos;&apos;_ ^South/Eastern Hemisphere:<br/>&gt; &gt; Austronesian Outpost of Anaphoria<br/>&lt;<a href="http://anaphoriasouth.blogspot.com/">http://anaphoriasouth.blogspot.com/</a>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &apos;,&apos;,&apos;,&apos;,&apos;,&apos;,&apos;,&apos;,&apos;,&apos;,&apos;,&apos;,&apos;,&apos;,&apos;,&apos;,&apos;,&apos;,&apos;,&apos;,&apos;,&apos;,&apos;,&apos;,&apos;,&apos;,&apos;,&apos;,&apos;,<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; Torsten Anders wrote:<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; Dear all,<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; thanks Charles and Carl for your replies concerning key-mappings for<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; this hexagon keyboard. It seems to me that several generalised<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; keyboards went for a similar key arrangement (e.g., the TERPSTRA and<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; the Wilson Generalized Keyboards from Starr Labs). The Scalatron<br/>keys<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; are round, but the arrangement is also similar.<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; What key-mappings are used for these keyboards? I understand that in<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; principle you can tune them any way you like, but of course some<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; mappings make more sense than others. In particular, I am interested<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; in mappings which allow for 3 to 7 prime limit harmony (or even<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; beyond). For example, Charles kindly sent a Wilson layout (see<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; below). I understand that when tuned in 31 ET, this mapping would<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; allow for 3 to 7 limit primes. Also the default harmonic table<br/>of the<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; AXiS could be tuned in some non-12 ET way (e.g., in JI). However, it<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; appears to me a harmonic table would only allow for 3 and 5-limit<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; harmony -- or any other two prime factor limits, because the<br/>table is<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; two-dimensional.

Since<br/>&gt; &gt; composers often didn&apos;t have microtonal resources to work with, their<br/>&gt; &gt; solution to finding new sounds was often simply to branch out further<br/>&gt; &gt; along the 5-limit JI lattice (in a metaphorical sort of way) to<br/>&gt; &gt; &quot;extend&quot; the harmonies that they already had access to, and so these<br/>&gt; &gt; harmonies that are inconsistent in 72-tet are unfortunately<br/>relatively<br/>&gt; &gt; common.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; In fact, just to generalize, the relatively small step size of 16.667<br/>&gt; &gt; cents means that any error over 8.333 cents will round up or down to<br/>&gt; &gt; an adjacent step, and since the error for 3/2 in 72-tet is around 2<br/>&gt; &gt; cents, 5 stacked fifths is enough to screw up the rounding in 72-tet.<br/>&gt; &gt; The -3 cent error for 5/4 means that 3 of those stacked will be<br/>&gt; &gt; inconsistent. The same thing applies to the 7th and 11th harmonics as<br/>&gt; &gt; well.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; This in my experience makes 72-tet relatively hard to play at times.<br/>&gt; &gt; You can either abandon the consistency principle and just accept a<br/>&gt; &gt; small amount of error for the sake of easier conceptualization, which<br/>&gt; &gt; I think sounds bad and much unlike the extremely fine and &quot;pure&quot;<br/>&gt; &gt; character of 72-tet that makes it so attractive to begin with -- or<br/>&gt; &gt; you come up with some rule to adjust the harmonies, like a rule of +1<br/>&gt; &gt; step every 5 fifths or so, which is pretty messy to think about,<br/>&gt; &gt; especially when you get into upper structure triads and higher-limit<br/>&gt; &gt; harmonies. Either way, the inconsistency of 72-tet is the<br/>deal-breaker<br/>&gt; &gt; for me, especially when you compare it to lower-division temperaments<br/>&gt; &gt; like 53-tet, or even to some degree 41-tet. But 53-tet doesn&apos;t do so<br/>&gt; &gt; well with 7-limit harmonies, and so I hate equal temperaments.

I understand<br/>that in<br/>&gt; &gt;     &gt; principle you can tune them any way you like, but of course some<br/>&gt; &gt;     &gt; mappings make more sense than others. In particular, I am<br/>interested<br/>&gt; &gt;     &gt; in mappings which allow for 3 to 7 prime limit harmony (or even<br/>&gt; &gt;     &gt; beyond).

I understand that when tuned in 31 ET, this mapping<br/>would<br/>&gt; &gt;     &gt; allow for 3 to 7 limit primes. Also the default harmonic table<br/>&gt; &gt;     of the<br/>&gt; &gt;     &gt; AXiS could be tuned in some non-12 ET way (e.g., in JI).<br/>However, it<br/>&gt; &gt;     &gt; appears to me a harmonic table would only allow for 3 and<br/>5-limit<br/>&gt; &gt;     &gt; harmony -- or any other two prime factor limits, because the<br/>&gt; &gt;     table is<br/>&gt; &gt;     &gt; two-dimensional.

An equal temperament may<br/>have very good approximations of the intervals in question, but when<br/>stacking up, the deviations from Just mean that the later intervals<br/>are no longer acceptable.</p><p>In the case of 34 equal, both &quot;6/5&quot; and &quot;5/4&quot; are both almost exactly<br/>2 cents high. So in your chord it&apos;s going to overshoot the Just mark<br/>to such an extent that the closest approximation is going to be<br/>almost one degree of 34 high (a misspelling or whatever you want to<br/>call it). Hmmm... I think the amount of deviation from the Just goal<br/>here would be about the same as in 72, if I&apos;m not mistaken- 13 cents<br/>too high when using the nearest, and &quot;wrong&quot;, key. And egregiously<br/>off, 20+ cents, using the &quot;right note&quot;.</p><p>But 34 is screwed from the get-go as far as being a proper<br/>temperament for Just-oriented Western music, in contrast to being a<br/>kind of field of possible intervals or tetrachord divisions or<br/>whatever (where it excels), having no &quot;circle&quot; of fifths, an unlinked<br/>M3, and just not plain not being or sounding meantoney.</p><p>Anyway your example is an example of why I was grumbling about the<br/>superiority of the idea of integer limits, rather than prime or odd<br/>limits.</p><p>-Cameron Bobro</p><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;Mike Battaglia&quot; &lt;battaglia01@...&gt;<br/>wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Sorry, quick correction - the #15 is one syntonic comma HIGHER than<br/>the<br/>&gt; chromatic semitone.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; On Mon, May 26, 2008 at 5:27 AM, Mike Battaglia &lt;battaglia01@...&gt;<br/>&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; I just realized as well, maybe people don&apos;t know what chord I&apos;m<br/>talking<br/>&gt; &gt; about -- I&apos;m just referring to 5-limit music here.

The<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt; accumulated error of the fifths and thirds builds up to the<br/>point where it<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt; is greater than half of the step size of a single 72-tet step,<br/>and so the<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt; nearest approximation of the note in question is one step off<br/>from where<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt; you&apos;d expect it to be if you look at the intervals making it up.<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt; If you don&apos;t believe me, try it in scala and see! Put in the<br/>numbers above<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt; - 32:40:48:60:72:90:108:135 - which should be C E- G B- D F#- A<br/>C#- and<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt; you&apos;ll see the 13.33333 cent rounding error for the 135th<br/>harmonic if you<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt; set it to be a 72-tet approximation (it will be C#, not C#-).<br/>Then, change<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt; the last number to 134 or something just so scala will round<br/>that last note<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt; down to the proper C#-, and you&apos;ll hear that it sounds much<br/>worse. 53-tet<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt; handles this chord much better, as the step sizes for each<br/>interval are<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt; consistent, and so it&apos;s easier to think about. Being easy to<br/>think about is<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt; supposed to be the primary advantage of 72-tet, and in most<br/>cases it is, but<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt; it breaks down here.<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt; So it sounds good to say that 72-tet is consistent to the 17-<br/>limit, but<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt; thinking about consistency that way might be misleading when<br/>evaluating a<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt; temperament, especially as most of western harmony consists of<br/>stacked<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt; fifths and thirds  For example, 3 stacked fifths, C-G-D-A is<br/>technically a<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt; 27-limit chord. A temperament that is consistent up to the 25-<br/>limit for<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt; example might sound great at first glance, but it means that at<br/>the 27-limit<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt; the consistency of the fifths would break down, and being able<br/>to have 3<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt; fifths on top of each other is pretty important for any<br/>temperament. This<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt; again has nothing to do with meantone temperament or the<br/>syntonic comma in<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt; general -- it&apos;s a different phenomenon I&apos;m describing.<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt; -Mike<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt; On Mon, May 26, 2008 at 2:38 AM, Carl Lumma &lt;carl@...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;   --- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a> &lt;tuning%<a href="http://40yahoogroups.com">40yahoogroups.com</a>&gt;,<br/>&quot;Mike<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; Battaglia&quot; &lt;battaglia01@&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; I&apos;m talking about a slightly different notion of consistency,<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; I think.<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; It is true that 72 is 17-limit consistent, but most of western<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; harmony doesn&apos;t work like that.

Western 5-limit harmony mainly consists of &gt; stacked major and minor thirds, which is so obvious I&apos;m sure that you &gt; would all find it slightly insulting to even mention :P. The problem is &gt; that when you stack enough fifths or major thirds on top of each other, &gt; the harmony breaks down in 72-tet, like in the case of the #15 chord, &gt; where the C# is off. Being as jazz especially consists of a lot of &gt; quartal voicings, and 72-tet is a relatively poor match for a bunch of &gt; stacked fifths, it is slightly less useful. 5 stacked fifths will &gt; &quot;break&quot; the consistency of the harmony, as will 3 thirds. Even in &gt; non-meantone music, I still find this to be an issue.</p><p>There&apos;s a certain school of harmony that talks about stacked major and minor thirds.  But that school usually also talks about 12 note equal temperament.  I wouldn&apos;t expect such chords to work outside of 12 note equal temperament.  If they can be tuned other than 12 note equal temperament I wouldn&apos;t assume that it should be with pure 5-limit thirds that add up to complex 5-limit dissonances.</p><p>If that is what you&apos;re doing, then yes, being 17-limit consistent is irrelevant.  And 72-tet isn&apos;t the best temperament out there for 5-limit harmony.  But it does that the advantage that stacked fifths will give *exactly the same* results as the do in 12-tet.</p><p>A chord that could easily be seen as failing outside meantone is the plain old dominant seventh.</p><p>G B D F</p><p>If this is about stacked 5-limit thirds the interval G-F is 9:5.  But if you want it to resolve onto a tonic C major chord it&apos;s helpful if C F is 4:3.  These two criteria are inconsistent unless you have a meantone.  There&apos;s no need to go to 15th chords for problems to arise with different tunings.</p><p>&gt; So if we view chords like these as musical excursions into the JI &gt; lattice, then you realize that going far enough in any one direction on &gt; the lattice will cause rounding errors in -any- equal temperament, and &gt; 72-tet&apos;s tolerance threshold for that is pretty low, especially compared &gt; to 53-tet. This might not bother many people, as a #15 chord is kind of &gt; a new sound even in jazz, but in some later classical works, extremely &gt; extended chords like that are heard quite a bit (take Amaj/C, for &gt; instance). Of course, the option always remains to manually adjust for &gt; the inconsistencies, but I find it makes it extremely difficult to &gt; figure out which note to hit if you&apos;re far out in 5-limit JI space when &gt; there are rounding errors and the step sizes are so small. The option &gt; also exists to just ignore the inconsistencies, but I find that it &gt; sounds much better to adjust for them. I find the whole process to be &gt; slightly irritating, although if you don&apos;t care so much about chords &gt; like that, then I think 72-tet is incredibly useful.</p><p>Yes, any equal temperament with pure octaves will eventually give an inconsistency if the set of intervals you&apos;re trying to approximate gets large enough.  But why exactly does it matter?</p><p>So Amaj/C is C A C# E?  I don&apos;t see any particular problems with it.</p><p>Why do you have to &quot;manually adjust&quot; anything?  The intervals of 72-tet are consistent in themselves.  The results of stacked fifths are the same as you get in 12-equal.  Who do you think&apos;s going to notice that C C#- is slightly more than half a step off from the extended JI ratio you&apos;re predicting?</p><p>&gt; For reference, the #15 chord I&apos;m talking about is &gt; 32:40:48:60:72:90:108:135, or 1/1:5/4:3/2:15/8:9/4:45/16:27/8:135/32. &gt; It&apos;s just a set of stacked major and minor thirds from C to C# -- C E G &gt; B D F# A C#, or in 72-tet notation (is it called Sims-maneri notation?) &gt; C E- G B- D F#- A C#-, except at the end the C#- jumps up to C#.</p><p>Why does it jump?  Who can recognize this ratio of 135:32? The note A is exactly where it would be in 12-tet.  The interval A-C# that ends the chord is exactly what you&apos;d expect from a 5-limit interval in 72-tet.  The offending interval C C#- is, by my calculations, exactly 0.53 steps (that&apos;s 8.8 cents) out.  Spell it as C C# and I make it 0.47 steps (7.8 cents) out instead.  It&apos;s more to the point to say that it&apos;s always out of tune, rather than approximated inconsistently.</p><p>Remember that minor thirds in 12-tet are over 15 cents out.   So if discrepancies of this order are a problem then 12-tet has never been suitable for traditional harmony.  If the C#- &quot;jumps&quot; to C# then the interval C C# is exactly where you&apos;d expect it to be from 12-tet and the bad third of A C# is also exactly what it is in 12-tet.</p><p>&gt; Again, just my opinion on it. As I am particularly enamored with that &gt; style of composition, I find 72-tet to have some serious shortcomings. &gt; Especially when it&apos;s touted as being &quot;easy&quot; for musicians to adjust to &gt; because it has 12-tet as a subset -- it becomes much less easy for &gt; musicians to adjust to when they have to jump up or down a step to deal &gt; with inconsistencies like this.</p><p>Well, sure, 72-tet isn&apos;t the best 5-limit temperament out there.  It&apos;s usually promoted as something that takes you *outside* traditional harmony, what with not being a meantone and having all those higher-prime intervals to choose from.  If 5-limit harmony is what you want maybe 5-limit JI will do the trick with fewer notes.  Or 53-tet. Or schismatic temperament, which is very accurate and should be relatively simple for these chords (probably requiring less than 53 notes).</p><p>The good thing about 72-tet is that it divides 12-tet, and instrumentalists can learn to deal with it accordingly. However imperfect it is the best temperament with those properties even in the 5-limit.  With the example you gave the musicians have to jump not much more than half a step.</p><p>&gt; Just my two cents.</p><p>I&apos;m sorry if you feel you&apos;ve been cheated but, yes, 72-tet has these properties.</p><p>                  Graham</p></div><h3><a id=76630 href="#76630">ðŸ”—</a>Cameron Bobro &#x3C;misterbobro@...&#x3E;</h3><span>5/26/2008 6:11:16 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, Graham Breed &lt;gbreed@...&gt; wrote:</p><p>&gt;<br/>&gt; A chord that could easily be seen as failing outside<br/>&gt; meantone is the plain old dominant seventh.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; G B D F<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; If this is about stacked 5-limit thirds the interval G-F is<br/>&gt; 9:5.

Your approach is in some ways analogous to trying to<br/>explain the trance that some dancers go through in certain<br/>music-cultures while not even for a moment questioning the dancer&apos;s<br/>claim that the spirit of one of their ancestors has entered their body.<br/>That claim by the dancer may indicate to us something about the state<br/>of consciousness - that they do not feel cognitively conscious and in<br/>control perhaps.  But there is no reason to assume that they in fact<br/>know that their claim is true, despite how ardently they may claim it.</p><p>A whole culture and history of jazz that is based on piano theory and<br/>claims that they are stacking thirds and fifths is not at all proof<br/>that they are really doing that or experiencing it that way.  It may<br/>indicate SOMETHING about the music, but we can&apos;t accept the folk claim<br/>as absolutely unquestionably true.</p><p>How absolutely important is it in jazz, for instance, for the 13 of a<br/>13 chord to be a third away from an 11?  NOT AT ALL, because 11s are<br/>often absent from 13 chords!  What about for it to be a perfect fifth<br/>of a 9?  Not in that case either, because it could be all sorts of<br/>arrangements, including having no 9 in the chord at all.  It is<br/>ridiculous in my view that jazz theory talks about that note as being<br/>a 13.  It seems by all accounts that I know of to simply be another<br/>example of the human desire to fit everything into explanations of<br/>simple patterns.  I think it is a pure misunderstanding.</p><p>I can, on my Tonal Plexus, play very close to exact versions of any of<br/>the options you&apos;re mentioning, and the only ones that sound<br/>harmonically reasonable are the harmonic ones.  In that case, the 13&apos;s<br/>are generally actually tuned like 6ths, and they are actually 5/3<br/>ratios from the root.  And the #15, as you call it, is the same note<br/>as a b9, which is a 17th harmonic, which is 17/8 or 17/4 (octave...<br/>whatever) of the root.</p><p>Look, jazz players do all sorts of things that don&apos;t seem to actually<br/>be stacked thirds or fifths.  Really.  And yet they *name* every<br/>possible combination AS THOUGH it were stacked thirds and fifths.  The<br/>ability to pretend that it relates to that sort of lattice doesn&apos;t<br/>make it true in terms of how the music is experienced psychologically<br/>or why any particular note is chosen.</p><p>I think jazz harmony is based primarily on voice-leading.  Chords that<br/>sound like a crazy mess to a non-jazz listener out of context are to a<br/>jazz listener a reminder of a context in which they hear it before,<br/>and they don&apos;t hear a steady harmony, they hear a bunch of notes that<br/>they can imagine various parts of the chord leading around to other<br/>parts until we finally return to simpler harmony.</p><p>And jazz vocalists often sing 7th harmonics if they aren&apos;t being<br/>forced to math a tempered m7 from an instrument.  And there does exist<br/>a history of jazz artists who have worked at getting away from<br/>temperament as well.  The bias toward a lattice of fifths and thirds<br/>is not a jazz concept, but something inherent to 12ET that infects any<br/>music played on a standard 12ET piano, whether intended or not.</p><p>I will go so far as to say that I accuse you of imposing your<br/>intellectual ideas on the music - that you want the thirds to be<br/>thirds (as opposed to 17/14 intervals and such) because of your<br/>intellectual ideas and not because you would otherwise musically care.<br/> I think that if you want to be consistent with the tuning of<br/>traditional jazz piano, then the answer is simple: play 12ET piano.<br/>The fact that the (erroneous in my view) folk-jazz-theory of chord<br/>names causes problems with any other tuning shows simply enough that<br/>the theory is missing things.</p><p>Look at it cognitively: the drive in jazz is a mix between some<br/>relatively stable harmonies, voice-leading, dissonance and consonance,<br/>and just any agreement in melody/improvised parts with background.<br/>The only one of these things that requires precise tuning is the<br/>stable resolve harmonies, which are generally nothing beyond a 9th.<br/>Those harmonies are best tuned near-harmonic.  The rest of the<br/>harmonies are really voice-leading issues, and *in context*, which is<br/>what really matters, it is not very important what the precise tuning<br/>is.  The fundamental sound is a clustered, unresolved sound that leads<br/>from one place to the next.</p><p>At any rate, if you DON&apos;T want the traditional clustered tension of<br/>those chords, the far and away best tuning to make a resolved, stable<br/>chord is a near-harmonic one in which you should aim for matching<br/>harmonics and drop your intellectual hang up about whether they are<br/>normal fifths and thirds.</p><p>I sincerely hope no disrespect is taken with my bold assertions here.<br/> Disagreement and disrespect are not the same thing.  I have been<br/>accused in the past of similar intellectual dogmatism and in some<br/>cases come to realize the accusation was true.  And I simply<br/>reassessed my thinking and don&apos;t disrespect myself for going through<br/>that process.  I&apos;m grateful to those who made me re-focus and better<br/>understand what is really going on.</p><p>Best,<br/>Aaron Wolf</p><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;Mike Battaglia&quot; &lt;battaglia01@...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I&apos;m talking about a slightly different notion of consistency, I think.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; It is true that 72 is 17-limit consistent, but most of western harmony<br/>&gt; doesn&apos;t work like that. Western 5-limit harmony mainly consists of<br/>stacked<br/>&gt; major and minor thirds, which is so obvious I&apos;m sure that you would<br/>all find<br/>&gt; it slightly insulting to even mention :P. The problem is that when<br/>you stack<br/>&gt; enough fifths or major thirds on top of each other, the harmony<br/>breaks down<br/>&gt; in 72-tet, like in the case of the #15 chord, where the C# is off.<br/>Being as<br/>&gt; jazz especially consists of a lot of quartal voicings, and 72-tet is a<br/>&gt; relatively poor match for a bunch of stacked fifths, it is slightly less<br/>&gt; useful. 5 stacked fifths will &quot;break&quot; the consistency of the harmony, as<br/>&gt; will 3 thirds. Even in non-meantone music, I still find this to be<br/>an issue.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; So if we view chords like these as musical excursions into the JI<br/>lattice,<br/>&gt; then you realize that going far enough in any one direction on the<br/>lattice<br/>&gt; will cause rounding errors in -any- equal temperament, and 72-tet&apos;s<br/>&gt; tolerance threshold for that is pretty low, especially compared to<br/>53-tet.<br/>&gt; This might not bother many people, as a #15 chord is kind of a new sound<br/>&gt; even in jazz, but in some later classical works, extremely extended<br/>chords<br/>&gt; like that are heard quite a bit (take Amaj/C, for instance). Of<br/>course, the<br/>&gt; option always remains to manually adjust for the inconsistencies,<br/>but I find<br/>&gt; it makes it extremely difficult to figure out which note to hit if<br/>you&apos;re<br/>&gt; far out in 5-limit JI space when there are rounding errors and the step<br/>&gt; sizes are so small. The option also exists to just ignore the<br/>&gt; inconsistencies, but I find that it sounds much better to adjust for<br/>them. I<br/>&gt; find the whole process to be slightly irritating, although if you<br/>don&apos;t care<br/>&gt; so much about chords like that, then I think 72-tet is incredibly<br/>useful.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; For reference, the #15 chord I&apos;m talking about is<br/>32:40:48:60:72:90:108:135,<br/>&gt; or 1/1:5/4:3/2:15/8:9/4:45/16:27/8:135/32. It&apos;s just a set of<br/>stacked major<br/>&gt; and minor thirds from C to C# -- C E G B D F# A C#, or in 72-tet<br/>notation<br/>&gt; (is it called Sims-maneri notation?) C E- G B- D F#- A C#-, except<br/>at the<br/>&gt; end the C#- jumps up to C#.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Again, just my opinion on it. As I am particularly enamored with<br/>that style<br/>&gt; of composition, I find 72-tet to have some serious shortcomings.<br/>Especially<br/>&gt; when it&apos;s touted as being &quot;easy&quot; for musicians to adjust to because<br/>it has<br/>&gt; 12-tet as a subset -- it becomes much less easy for musicians to<br/>adjust to<br/>&gt; when they have to jump up or down a step to deal with<br/>inconsistencies like<br/>&gt; this.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Just my two cents.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; -Mike<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; On Sun, May 25, 2008 at 6:20 PM, Carl Lumma &lt;carl@...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;   Hi Mike,<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; Furthermore, that has always been my criticism of 72-tet as<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; well -- I thought it was the greatest thing in the world until<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; I realized that the saturated #15 chord (C E- G B- D F#- A C#-)<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; is inconsistent in 72-tet -- rounding errors will cause the<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; best approximation for the C#- to jump up one step to C#.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; 72 is 17-limit consistent, so I&apos;m not sure what you&apos;re running<br/>&gt; &gt; into.

But piano players often stack fifths or<br/>thirds on top of each other in &quot;boring old vanilla 5-limit fashion&quot; as<br/>-ONE- particular feeling or harmonic style, and that approach will<br/>break down in 72-tet after you get far enough.

Where is the &quot;misinterpretation of jazz&quot;<br/>in that?</p><p>Furthermore, I myself as a jazz pianist screw around with chord<br/>extensions like #15&apos;s. The #15 is not where I&apos;d expect it to be in<br/>72-tet, and so it&apos;s irritating. If I were in C minor, for example, and<br/>I wanted to play an Ebsus7 chord to imply Phrygian, voiced as Eb+ Ab+<br/>Db+ F (let&apos;s say for the sake of argument I have comma-adjusted<br/>everything correctly) -- would any of the notes have to be further<br/>adjusted by a step due to stupid &quot;rounding errors?&quot; Nobody who&apos;s<br/>playing fast-paced, spontaneous, improvised music is going to want to<br/>have to think about that.</p><p>The point is while jazz itself has obviously extended past the 7 and<br/>11 limits, it still obviously lives in the 5-limit world as well, and<br/>some of the things that jazz pianists like myself enjoy playing are<br/>weird in 72-tet due to these stupid rounding errors. As a jazz pianist<br/>interested in microtonality, I&apos;m looking to find a system that people<br/>would find easy to play and conceptualize so that I can try to<br/>popularize it amongst my friends and create some spontaneous<br/>improvised music out of it, because I haven&apos;t really heard jazz mix<br/>with microtonality in that way before, especially from the perspective<br/>of a keyboardist. 72tet I thought was the most amazing invention in<br/>the world until I realized that these &quot;rounding errors&quot; actually exist<br/>and make it considerably more difficult to figure out what step you<br/>want to actually play to get at the note that you want.</p><p>If jazz musicians aren&apos;t thinking in terms of notes (C to Eb to Gb to<br/>A) they&apos;re thinking in terms of intervals (I want to play a pattern<br/>that goes up repeating in minor thirds).

Don&apos;t think I&apos;m being disrespectful either. I am<br/>willing to accept that maybe 72-tet is really all that it&apos;s cracked up<br/>to be, but these rounding errors are the dealbreaker for me right now.</p><p>&gt; How absolutely important is it in jazz, for instance, for the 13 of a<br/>&gt; 13 chord to be a third away from an 11?  NOT AT ALL, because 11s are<br/>&gt; often absent from 13 chords!  What about for it to be a perfect fifth<br/>&gt; of a 9?  Not in that case either, because it could be all sorts of<br/>&gt; arrangements, including having no 9 in the chord at all.  It is<br/>&gt; ridiculous in my view that jazz theory talks about that note as being<br/>&gt; a 13.  It seems by all accounts that I know of to simply be another<br/>&gt; example of the human desire to fit everything into explanations of<br/>&gt; simple patterns.  I think it is a pure misunderstanding.<br/>The thing you&apos;re missing here is that I&apos;m not insinuating that the 13<br/>has to be stacked fifths. I&apos;m saying that stacked fifths sound good,<br/>whether or not they&apos;re used as a &quot;13th&quot; or not, and I -CAN&apos;T- do<br/>enough of those in 72-tet and have it sound consistent. Stacking<br/>fifths is something that I think just sounds cool, and I want to be<br/>able to explore that in jazz just like I want to explore higher limit<br/>harmonies (which is why I&apos;m currently on this forum :P) In 72-tet, I<br/>have to manually adjust these things due to mathematics and things I<br/>don&apos;t want to have to think about when I&apos;m playing jazz!</p><p>&gt; I can, on my Tonal Plexus, play very close to exact versions of any of<br/>&gt; the options you&apos;re mentioning, and the only ones that sound<br/>&gt; harmonically reasonable are the harmonic ones.  In that case, the 13&apos;s<br/>&gt; are generally actually tuned like 6ths, and they are actually 5/3<br/>&gt; ratios from the root.  And the #15, as you call it, is the same note<br/>&gt; as a b9, which is a 17th harmonic, which is 17/8 or 17/4 (octave...<br/>&gt; whatever) of the root.<br/>In boring ol&apos; classical jazz theory, which you seem to hate (:P) the<br/>13th and the 6th are given separate names because they often have<br/>separate functions. In Dorian mode (we&apos;ll say in D), for example, it<br/>often sounds really cool to play the B as if it were an approximation<br/>to 27/16. It creates a tension that I much like. Furthermore, I<br/>believe that any note in 12tet can be used to approximate any note<br/>near to it, and that the brain will &quot;guess&quot; at the right note due to<br/>context, so that it is possible in D Dorian for the B to be used<br/>either as 27/16 or as 5/3. I&apos;ve been exploring going a fifth up from<br/>that B too, as an extra tension (that&apos;s an F# over D Dorian, which in<br/>standard jazz theory &quot;breaks down&quot;). Unfortunately, going a fifth up<br/>from that B leads me to a note that in 72tet isn&apos;t where I&apos;d expect it<br/>to be -- the nearest note to what I want to hear would be one more<br/>step north due to accumulated errors in rounding.</p><p>&gt; I will go so far as to say that I accuse you of imposing your<br/>&gt; intellectual ideas on the music - that you want the thirds to be<br/>&gt; thirds (as opposed to 17/14 intervals and such) because of your<br/>&gt; intellectual ideas and not because you would otherwise musically care.<br/>False. See above about Dorian mode.</p><p>&gt;  I think that if you want to be consistent with the tuning of<br/>&gt; traditional jazz piano, then the answer is simple: play 12ET piano.<br/>&gt; The fact that the (erroneous in my view) folk-jazz-theory of chord<br/>&gt; names causes problems with any other tuning shows simply enough that<br/>&gt; the theory is missing things.<br/>In my experience, it usually signifies that that jazz theory stems<br/>from 12-tet, which is a meantone system. So just like a dominant 7<br/>could be a few different things, b9&apos;s could be 17th harmonics and such<br/>as well. I certainly get that. The theory is definitely missing<br/>things. I have imposed a structure of thirds and fifths as -ONE-<br/>possible musical &quot;color,&quot; and I can&apos;t get that in 72tet without<br/>considerable conceptual difficulty at times. There are other colors in<br/>72tet that I can get very easily that are inaccessible in 12tet.</p><p>&gt; Look at it cognitively: the drive in jazz is a mix between some<br/>&gt; relatively stable harmonies, voice-leading, dissonance and consonance,<br/>&gt; and just any agreement in melody/improvised parts with background.<br/>&gt; The only one of these things that requires precise tuning is the<br/>&gt; stable resolve harmonies, which are generally nothing beyond a 9th.<br/>&gt; Those harmonies are best tuned near-harmonic.  The rest of the<br/>&gt; harmonies are really voice-leading issues, and *in context*, which is<br/>&gt; what really matters, it is not very important what the precise tuning<br/>&gt; is.  The fundamental sound is a clustered, unresolved sound that leads<br/>&gt; from one place to the next.<br/>&gt;<br/>This is I counter accust you of imposing YOUR intellectual ideas on<br/>jazz. :P Stable resolve harmonics often go beyond a 9th (a #11 or 13<br/>for example are used this way). In fact, even if previous jazz<br/>musicians hadn&apos;t really gone past the 9th or the #11 doesn&apos;t mean that<br/>you COULDN&apos;T do that. So screw what has already been done in jazz --<br/>the whole point of this forum is to find things that have not.</p><p>However, if I want to experiment with ending a song in a maj7#11 chord<br/>-- which jazz musicians do ALL THE TIME -- and I want to experiment<br/>with adding yet another fifth on top of that to get what I call a #15,<br/>just because that is for some reason the sound I want -- then the note<br/>I would reach is rounded incorrectly in 72tet. Note that the #11 I<br/>would reach here is different from 11/8 or 11/4.</p><p>&gt; At any rate, if you DON&apos;T want the traditional clustered tension of<br/>&gt; those chords, the far and away best tuning to make a resolved, stable<br/>&gt; chord is a near-harmonic one in which you should aim for matching<br/>&gt; harmonics and drop your intellectual hang up about whether they are<br/>&gt; normal fifths and thirds.<br/>Sometimes. Again, the common practice of ending a song on a lydian<br/>chord contradicts this and often sounds really good.</p><p>&gt; I sincerely hope no disrespect is taken with my bold assertions here.<br/>&gt;  Disagreement and disrespect are not the same thing.  I have been<br/>&gt; accused in the past of similar intellectual dogmatism and in some<br/>&gt; cases come to realize the accusation was true.  And I simply<br/>&gt; reassessed my thinking and don&apos;t disrespect myself for going through<br/>&gt; that process.  I&apos;m grateful to those who made me re-focus and better<br/>&gt; understand what is really going on.<br/>No, I value feedback like this. I&apos;m trying to create and eventually<br/>popularize in some grassroots way an easy-to-understand microtonal<br/>system. 72tet I thought was absolutely phenomenal as it just requires<br/>different inflections of 12tet notes until I realized that I couldn&apos;t<br/>play my beloved minor #17 or major #15 chord consistently :( And so<br/>there went that.

And<br/>training has a noticeable impact, as well as other cultural things.<br/>Now that I&apos;ve done enough barbershop singing, I hear a lot more chords<br/>as if they related to pure harmonies...</p><p>&gt; &gt; I will go so far as to say that I accuse you of imposing your<br/>&gt; &gt; intellectual ideas on the music - that you want the thirds to be<br/>&gt; &gt; thirds (as opposed to 17/14 intervals and such) because of your<br/>&gt; &gt; intellectual ideas and not because you would otherwise musically care.<br/>&gt; False. See above about Dorian mode.<br/>&gt;</p><p>Ok, glad you&apos;ve clarified.  Hope you&apos;re not offended at my initial charge.</p><p>&gt; &gt;  I think that if you want to be consistent with the tuning of<br/>&gt; &gt; traditional jazz piano, then the answer is simple: play 12ET piano.<br/>&gt; &gt; The fact that the (erroneous in my view) folk-jazz-theory of chord<br/>&gt; &gt; names causes problems with any other tuning shows simply enough that<br/>&gt; &gt; the theory is missing things.<br/>&gt; In my experience, it usually signifies that that jazz theory stems<br/>&gt; from 12-tet, which is a meantone system. So just like a dominant 7<br/>&gt; could be a few different things, b9&apos;s could be 17th harmonics and such<br/>&gt; as well. I certainly get that. The theory is definitely missing<br/>&gt; things. I have imposed a structure of thirds and fifths as -ONE-<br/>&gt; possible musical &quot;color,&quot; and I can&apos;t get that in 72tet without<br/>&gt; considerable conceptual difficulty at times. There are other colors in<br/>&gt; 72tet that I can get very easily that are inaccessible in 12tet.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; Look at it cognitively: the drive in jazz is a mix between some<br/>&gt; &gt; relatively stable harmonies, voice-leading, dissonance and consonance,<br/>&gt; &gt; and just any agreement in melody/improvised parts with background.<br/>&gt; &gt; The only one of these things that requires precise tuning is the<br/>&gt; &gt; stable resolve harmonies, which are generally nothing beyond a 9th.<br/>&gt; &gt; Those harmonies are best tuned near-harmonic.  The rest of the<br/>&gt; &gt; harmonies are really voice-leading issues, and *in context*, which is<br/>&gt; &gt; what really matters, it is not very important what the precise tuning<br/>&gt; &gt; is.  The fundamental sound is a clustered, unresolved sound that leads<br/>&gt; &gt; from one place to the next.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; This is I counter accust you of imposing YOUR intellectual ideas on<br/>&gt; jazz. :P Stable resolve harmonics often go beyond a 9th (a #11 or 13<br/>&gt; for example are used this way). In fact, even if previous jazz<br/>&gt; musicians hadn&apos;t really gone past the 9th or the #11 doesn&apos;t mean that<br/>&gt; you COULDN&apos;T do that. So screw what has already been done in jazz --<br/>&gt; the whole point of this forum is to find things that have not.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; However, if I want to experiment with ending a song in a maj7#11 chord<br/>&gt; -- which jazz musicians do ALL THE TIME -- and I want to experiment<br/>&gt; with adding yet another fifth on top of that to get what I call a #15,<br/>&gt; just because that is for some reason the sound I want -- then the note<br/>&gt; I would reach is rounded incorrectly in 72tet. Note that the #11 I<br/>&gt; would reach here is different from 11/8 or 11/4.<br/>&gt;</p><p>Ok, 72 is not a be-all end-all.  I&apos;ve never been a steadfast dogmatic<br/>proponent of it at all.<br/>At any rate, MY experience, and I strongly suspect based on all the<br/>evidence I am currently aware of, is that ending a song on a maj7#11<br/>is a neat way to end WITHOUT full resolve (at least until the silence<br/>after the song).  Tons of music chooses not to fully resolve tension,<br/>and because listeners may have an idea of the resolve in their mind,<br/>that is enough and there is a totally expressive value to an<br/>incomplete resolution even at an end.  I myself never experience such<br/>chords as a total and utter resolve despite trying very hard to drop<br/>any expectations otherwise.  The complexity of the sound and the beats<br/>and buzzes simply are not fully relaxed and resolved, and that&apos;s fine.<br/> I really suspect that you and everyone else would acknowledge the<br/>same thing if you do your best to objectively compare the impact of<br/>such an ending compared to a simpler harmony with total resolve.</p><p>On the other hand, I could imagine someone being so keenly aware of<br/>each and every note in a chord such that they expect a complete set of<br/>notes at the end, kind of like a polytonal experience.  And in that<br/>regard, you will feel the most resolve with the whole crazy chord, but<br/>NOT because of its chordal function, but because of the MELODIC<br/>function of each independent note...  But experiencing that would<br/>require a lot of complex setting up of context and would be<br/>excessively challenging to objectively test.</p><p>&gt; &gt; At any rate, if you DON&apos;T want the traditional clustered tension of<br/>&gt; &gt; those chords, the far and away best tuning to make a resolved, stable<br/>&gt; &gt; chord is a near-harmonic one in which you should aim for matching<br/>&gt; &gt; harmonics and drop your intellectual hang up about whether they are<br/>&gt; &gt; normal fifths and thirds.<br/>&gt; Sometimes. Again, the common practice of ending a song on a lydian<br/>&gt; chord contradicts this and often sounds really good.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; I sincerely hope no disrespect is taken with my bold assertions here.<br/>&gt; &gt;  Disagreement and disrespect are not the same thing.  I have been<br/>&gt; &gt; accused in the past of similar intellectual dogmatism and in some<br/>&gt; &gt; cases come to realize the accusation was true.  And I simply<br/>&gt; &gt; reassessed my thinking and don&apos;t disrespect myself for going through<br/>&gt; &gt; that process.  I&apos;m grateful to those who made me re-focus and better<br/>&gt; &gt; understand what is really going on.<br/>&gt; No, I value feedback like this. I&apos;m trying to create and eventually<br/>&gt; popularize in some grassroots way an easy-to-understand microtonal<br/>&gt; system. 72tet I thought was absolutely phenomenal as it just requires<br/>&gt; different inflections of 12tet notes until I realized that I couldn&apos;t<br/>&gt; play my beloved minor #17 or major #15 chord consistently :( And so<br/>&gt; there went that. So I&apos;m still looking.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; -Mike<br/>&gt;</p><p>Please seriously consider the Tonal Plexus.

By<br/>&gt; alternately stacking major and minor thirds on top of each<br/>&gt; other, one will hit the following scale degrees:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; 1 3 5 maj7 9 #11 13 #15<br/>&gt; C E G B D F# A C# (12-tet notation)<br/>&gt; C E- G B- D F#- A C#- (72-tet notation - what it should be)<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Classical jazz theory doesn&apos;t usually mention 3rd octave chord<br/>&gt; extensions, but as someone who is currently studying jazz<br/>&gt; piano, that chord is talked about often. I hear it in classical<br/>&gt; music as well -- maybe not voiced that way, but at least I hear<br/>&gt; that #15 note is used fairly often. Also, the C# that is a #15<br/>&gt; here will differ from the normal C# that is a chromatic semitone<br/>&gt; by a syntonic comma (the #15 is lower). You would expect this<br/>&gt; C# to be accessed in relation to C in 72-tet as a C#-, one step<br/>&gt; down from the standard 12-tet C#, but due to accumulated<br/>&gt; rounding errors, it actually ends up one 72-tet step higher<br/>&gt; from where it would be. [snip]</p><p>To my mind, the only problem would be if the consonances in<br/>this chord couldn&apos;t all take their best 72-ET tunings at once.<br/>The consonances are, I presume, 3:2, 5:4, and 6:5.  The best<br/>tunings of these in 72-ET are 42, 23, and 19 steps.</p><p>First let&apos;s examine the chord in 12-ET:<br/>[This is best viewed in a constant-width font - see &quot;message<br/>options&quot; to the right of this message on Yahoo&apos;s web site.]<br/>C   E   G   B   D   F#  A   C#  note name<br/>0   4   7   11  14  18  21  25  steps</p><p>The consonances in 12-ET are 7, 4, and 3 steps.  So let&apos;s<br/>check the 3rds...</p><p>C-E should be 4 and is 4<br/>E-G should be 3 and is 3<br/>G-B should be 4 and is 4<br/>B-D should be 3 and is 3<br/>D-F# should be 4 and is 4<br/>F#-A should be 3 and is 3<br/>A-C# should be 4 and is 4</p><p>A-OK.  Now the 5ths...</p><p>C-G should be 7 and is 7<br/>E-B should be 7 and is 7<br/>G-D should be 7 and is 7<br/>B-F# should be 7 and is 7<br/>D-A should be 7 and is 7<br/>F#-C# should be 7 and is 7</p><p>Alright.  Now let&apos;s tune the thirds in 72-ET so they&apos;ll be<br/>right...</p><p>C   E   G   B   D   F#  A   C#  note name<br/>  M   m   M   m   M   m   M     3rd quality<br/>0  23  42  65  84  107 126 149</p><p>...and then check the 5ths...</p><p>C-G should be 42 and is 42  *OK*<br/>E-B should be 42 and is 42  *OK*<br/>G-D should be 42 and is 42  *OK*<br/>B-F# should be 42 and is 42  *OK*<br/>D-A should be 42 and is 42  *OK*<br/>F#-C# should be 42 and is 42  *OK*</p><p>So I don&apos;t see a problem.  The chord should work just like<br/>it does in 12-ET, but with the advantage of the better<br/>tunings of 72.  If you tune it the way I did (sorry I don&apos;t<br/>know Simms notation) does it sound good?  Better or worse<br/>than in 12-ET in your opinion?</p><p>Can you show us what you find confusing?  Are you thinking<br/>in terms of approximating the 135 directly?  135 isn&apos;t<br/>itself a consonance, so I wouldn&apos;t worry about that.</p><p>-Carl</p></div><h3><a id=76650 href="#76650">ðŸ”—</a>Mike Battaglia &#x3C;battaglia01@...&#x3E;</h3><span>5/26/2008 1:55:29 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>I am seriously considering it. I&apos;m looking for a keyboard to branch<br/>out into this stuff. I may have slightly different goals from a lot of<br/>people here -- I&apos;m looking for a system that is easy to THINK about so<br/>that I can spread it amongst people that haven&apos;t done years of<br/>independent research like most of us on the forum have done. 12tet is<br/>a miracle just because of that reason -- it&apos;s easy to conceptualize,<br/>and you can get a -HUGE- array of sounds with it. Of course, we all<br/>want to see what more is possible beyond 12tet and 5-limit music (and<br/>the &quot;tip-of-the-iceberg&quot; 7-limit stuff that has evolved), and so I<br/>think that the search for a temperament that is as easy to think about<br/>as 12tet (or only requires a little more work) but enables access to<br/>xenharmonic sounds is a worthy pursuit.</p><p>Of course, for me, I can always come up with some rule to adjust for<br/>rounding errors in 72tet, but I think that the average person who has<br/>no idea what a harmonic series is might find it a bit hard to grasp<br/>and so that system might pose a problem. I will look into the Tonal<br/>Plexus though, as it certainly seems to be a useful tool.</p><p>&gt; That&apos;s fair enough - except that there is a point that stacking of<br/>&gt; fifths breaks down ACOUSTICALLY (depending on timbre used) regardless<br/>&gt; of tuning. And anyway, in that regard, you would really like the<br/>&gt; Tonal Plexus and its 205ET, which does not temper out the Pythagorean<br/>&gt; comma and which has better fifths than 72ET.</p><p>I contest this. There is too much of an emphasis on different<br/>intervals as consonant or dissonant based on how they relate to the<br/>ROOT. You can also &quot;stack&quot; consonances on top of each other so that<br/>adjacent notes, while &quot;far out&quot; in JI space from the root, are related<br/>closely to other notes which eventually relate back to the root. This<br/>builds a complicated structure that often sounds really good. This is<br/>why a major 7th chord doesn&apos;t sound awful, for instance -- the C-B,<br/>while being a dissonance in its own right, &quot;fits&quot; into the puzzle of<br/>C-E-G-B as the B is related to the G which is related to the C and the<br/>B is also related to the E which is... well you get the point. So even<br/>though you might call that B a dissonance, your brain actually maps<br/>out a set of &quot;consonances&quot; which are all related. To get at this #15,<br/>I&apos;m just continuing the pattern that leads to a major chord, then a<br/>major7 chord, then a major9 chord, then a maj9#11 chord, etc.</p><p>&gt; EXACTLY! It&apos;s based on expectations! If you change your<br/>&gt; expectations, then you won&apos;t be irritated. You&apos;re irritated clearly<br/>&gt; because you have unrealistic expectations within that system. Anyway,<br/>&gt; once again - try the Tonal Plexus and 205ET - it works in these<br/>&gt; regards. Download the software from<br/>&gt; <a href="http://www.h-pi.com/downloads.html">http://www.h-pi.com/downloads.html</a> to try out a virtual version. And<br/>&gt; since it can be retuned to anything, you could adjust it to fit<br/>&gt; whatever expectations you want to have.<br/>Yup. I&apos;ll have to check it out. Note that my expectations are purely<br/>for 72-tet as a structure, not psychologically or acoustically.</p><p>&gt; &gt; If I were in C minor, for example, and<br/>&gt; &gt; I wanted to play an Ebsus7 chord to imply Phrygian, voiced as Eb+ Ab+<br/>&gt; &gt; Db+ F (let&apos;s say for the sake of argument I have comma-adjusted<br/>&gt; &gt; everything correctly) -- would any of the notes have to be further<br/>&gt; &gt; adjusted by a step due to stupid &quot;rounding errors?&quot; Nobody who&apos;s<br/>&gt; &gt; playing fast-paced, spontaneous, improvised music is going to want to<br/>&gt; &gt; have to think about that.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; RIGHT- and nobody playing fast-paced music notices commas either,<br/>&gt; unless they are in particularly prominent parts of the music.<br/>So if the music is slow, then they will notice. Having to &quot;guess&quot;<br/>roughly at where the intervals lie defeats the purpose of having any<br/>kind of tuning &quot;system&quot; to begin with in my mind. Although I suppose<br/>this could be a matter of preference.</p><p>&gt; Sure, that&apos;s reasonable, but I think the &quot;as if it were&quot; part is in<br/>&gt; your mind (which does not make it less significant since the whole<br/>&gt; point of music is how we experience it). And because of that, you<br/>&gt; can&apos;t easily make it be the case in a random listener&apos;s mind.</p><p>Oh yes you can. If I play the chord C E F# B D#, that D# will be heard<br/>by most people as a major third above the B, because of that F# B D#<br/>upper structure. It will not be heard as a 6/5 Eb above the C. Music<br/>is mainly how to get people to hear things in the way that you want.</p><p>&gt; At any rate, MY experience, and I strongly suspect based on all the<br/>&gt; evidence I am currently aware of, is that ending a song on a maj7#11<br/>&gt; is a neat way to end WITHOUT full resolve (at least until the silence<br/>&gt; after the song).

Other chords, like the #9 or b9, might be upper-limit<br/>harmonics that work in 12tet. But that maj7#11 is a network of fifths<br/>and thirds.</p><p>Simply put, I contest that the consonance of any note in a chord is<br/>determined by its rational-number relation to the root. It can also be<br/>determined by its rational-number relation to any other note in the<br/>chord.</p><p>Just some thoughts.<br/>-Mike</p></div><h3><a id=76651 href="#76651">ðŸ”—</a>Mike Battaglia &#x3C;battaglia01@...&#x3E;</h3><span>5/26/2008 1:59:31 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>&gt; I can, on my Tonal Plexus, play very close to exact versions of any of<br/>&gt; the options you&apos;re mentioning, and the only ones that sound<br/>&gt; harmonically reasonable are the harmonic ones.

Your approach is in some ways analogous to trying to<br/>&gt; explain the trance that some dancers go through in certain<br/>&gt; music-cultures while not even for a moment questioning the dancer&apos;s<br/>&gt; claim that the spirit of one of their ancestors has entered their body.<br/>&gt; That claim by the dancer may indicate to us something about the state<br/>&gt; of consciousness - that they do not feel cognitively conscious and in<br/>&gt; control perhaps. But there is no reason to assume that they in fact<br/>&gt; know that their claim is true, despite how ardently they may claim it.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; A whole culture and history of jazz that is based on piano theory and<br/>&gt; claims that they are stacking thirds and fifths is not at all proof<br/>&gt; that they are really doing that or experiencing it that way. It may<br/>&gt; indicate SOMETHING about the music, but we can&apos;t accept the folk claim<br/>&gt; as absolutely unquestionably true.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; How absolutely important is it in jazz, for instance, for the 13 of a<br/>&gt; 13 chord to be a third away from an 11? NOT AT ALL, because 11s are<br/>&gt; often absent from 13 chords! What about for it to be a perfect fifth<br/>&gt; of a 9? Not in that case either, because it could be all sorts of<br/>&gt; arrangements, including having no 9 in the chord at all. It is<br/>&gt; ridiculous in my view that jazz theory talks about that note as being<br/>&gt; a 13. It seems by all accounts that I know of to simply be another<br/>&gt; example of the human desire to fit everything into explanations of<br/>&gt; simple patterns. I think it is a pure misunderstanding.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I can, on my Tonal Plexus, play very close to exact versions of any of<br/>&gt; the options you&apos;re mentioning, and the only ones that sound<br/>&gt; harmonically reasonable are the harmonic ones.

Really. And yet they *name* every<br/>&gt; possible combination AS THOUGH it were stacked thirds and fifths. The<br/>&gt; ability to pretend that it relates to that sort of lattice doesn&apos;t<br/>&gt; make it true in terms of how the music is experienced psychologically<br/>&gt; or why any particular note is chosen.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I think jazz harmony is based primarily on voice-leading. Chords that<br/>&gt; sound like a crazy mess to a non-jazz listener out of context are to a<br/>&gt; jazz listener a reminder of a context in which they hear it before,<br/>&gt; and they don&apos;t hear a steady harmony, they hear a bunch of notes that<br/>&gt; they can imagine various parts of the chord leading around to other<br/>&gt; parts until we finally return to simpler harmony.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; And jazz vocalists often sing 7th harmonics if they aren&apos;t being<br/>&gt; forced to math a tempered m7 from an instrument. And there does exist<br/>&gt; a history of jazz artists who have worked at getting away from<br/>&gt; temperament as well. The bias toward a lattice of fifths and thirds<br/>&gt; is not a jazz concept, but something inherent to 12ET that infects any<br/>&gt; music played on a standard 12ET piano, whether intended or not.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I will go so far as to say that I accuse you of imposing your<br/>&gt; intellectual ideas on the music - that you want the thirds to be<br/>&gt; thirds (as opposed to 17/14 intervals and such) because of your<br/>&gt; intellectual ideas and not because you would otherwise musically care.<br/>&gt; I think that if you want to be consistent with the tuning of<br/>&gt; traditional jazz piano, then the answer is simple: play 12ET piano.<br/>&gt; The fact that the (erroneous in my view) folk-jazz-theory of chord<br/>&gt; names causes problems with any other tuning shows simply enough that<br/>&gt; the theory is missing things.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Look at it cognitively: the drive in jazz is a mix between some<br/>&gt; relatively stable harmonies, voice-leading, dissonance and consonance,<br/>&gt; and just any agreement in melody/improvised parts with background.<br/>&gt; The only one of these things that requires precise tuning is the<br/>&gt; stable resolve harmonies, which are generally nothing beyond a 9th.<br/>&gt; Those harmonies are best tuned near-harmonic. The rest of the<br/>&gt; harmonies are really voice-leading issues, and *in context*, which is<br/>&gt; what really matters, it is not very important what the precise tuning<br/>&gt; is. The fundamental sound is a clustered, unresolved sound that leads<br/>&gt; from one place to the next.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; At any rate, if you DON&apos;T want the traditional clustered tension of<br/>&gt; those chords, the far and away best tuning to make a resolved, stable<br/>&gt; chord is a near-harmonic one in which you should aim for matching<br/>&gt; harmonics and drop your intellectual hang up about whether they are<br/>&gt; normal fifths and thirds.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I sincerely hope no disrespect is taken with my bold assertions here.<br/>&gt; Disagreement and disrespect are not the same thing. I have been<br/>&gt; accused in the past of similar intellectual dogmatism and in some<br/>&gt; cases come to realize the accusation was true. And I simply<br/>&gt; reassessed my thinking and don&apos;t disrespect myself for going through<br/>&gt; that process.

Western 5-limit harmony mainly consists of<br/>&gt; stacked<br/>&gt; &gt; major and minor thirds, which is so obvious I&apos;m sure that you would<br/>&gt; all find<br/>&gt; &gt; it slightly insulting to even mention :P. The problem is that when<br/>&gt; you stack<br/>&gt; &gt; enough fifths or major thirds on top of each other, the harmony<br/>&gt; breaks down<br/>&gt; &gt; in 72-tet, like in the case of the #15 chord, where the C# is off.<br/>&gt; Being as<br/>&gt; &gt; jazz especially consists of a lot of quartal voicings, and 72-tet is a<br/>&gt; &gt; relatively poor match for a bunch of stacked fifths, it is slightly less<br/>&gt; &gt; useful. 5 stacked fifths will &quot;break&quot; the consistency of the harmony, as<br/>&gt; &gt; will 3 thirds. Even in non-meantone music, I still find this to be<br/>&gt; an issue.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; So if we view chords like these as musical excursions into the JI<br/>&gt; lattice,<br/>&gt; &gt; then you realize that going far enough in any one direction on the<br/>&gt; lattice<br/>&gt; &gt; will cause rounding errors in -any- equal temperament, and 72-tet&apos;s<br/>&gt; &gt; tolerance threshold for that is pretty low, especially compared to<br/>&gt; 53-tet.<br/>&gt; &gt; This might not bother many people, as a #15 chord is kind of a new sound<br/>&gt; &gt; even in jazz, but in some later classical works, extremely extended<br/>&gt; chords<br/>&gt; &gt; like that are heard quite a bit (take Amaj/C, for instance). Of<br/>&gt; course, the<br/>&gt; &gt; option always remains to manually adjust for the inconsistencies,<br/>&gt; but I find<br/>&gt; &gt; it makes it extremely difficult to figure out which note to hit if<br/>&gt; you&apos;re<br/>&gt; &gt; far out in 5-limit JI space when there are rounding errors and the step<br/>&gt; &gt; sizes are so small. The option also exists to just ignore the<br/>&gt; &gt; inconsistencies, but I find that it sounds much better to adjust for<br/>&gt; them. I<br/>&gt; &gt; find the whole process to be slightly irritating, although if you<br/>&gt; don&apos;t care<br/>&gt; &gt; so much about chords like that, then I think 72-tet is incredibly<br/>&gt; useful.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; For reference, the #15 chord I&apos;m talking about is<br/>&gt; 32:40:48:60:72:90:108:135,<br/>&gt; &gt; or 1/1:5/4:3/2:15/8:9/4:45/16:27/8:135/32. It&apos;s just a set of<br/>&gt; stacked major<br/>&gt; &gt; and minor thirds from C to C# -- C E G B D F# A C#, or in 72-tet<br/>&gt; notation<br/>&gt; &gt; (is it called Sims-maneri notation?) C E- G B- D F#- A C#-, except<br/>&gt; at the<br/>&gt; &gt; end the C#- jumps up to C#.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; Again, just my opinion on it. As I am particularly enamored with<br/>&gt; that style<br/>&gt; &gt; of composition, I find 72-tet to have some serious shortcomings.<br/>&gt; Especially<br/>&gt; &gt; when it&apos;s touted as being &quot;easy&quot; for musicians to adjust to because<br/>&gt; it has<br/>&gt; &gt; 12-tet as a subset -- it becomes much less easy for musicians to<br/>&gt; adjust to<br/>&gt; &gt; when they have to jump up or down a step to deal with<br/>&gt; inconsistencies like<br/>&gt; &gt; this.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; Just my two cents.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; -Mike<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; On Sun, May 25, 2008 at 6:20 PM, Carl Lumma &lt;carl@...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; Hi Mike,<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Furthermore, that has always been my criticism of 72-tet as<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; well -- I thought it was the greatest thing in the world until<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I realized that the saturated #15 chord (C E- G B- D F#- A C#-)<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; is inconsistent in 72-tet -- rounding errors will cause the<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; best approximation for the C#- to jump up one step to C#.<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; 72 is 17-limit consistent, so I&apos;m not sure what you&apos;re running<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; into.

By<br/>&gt; &gt; alternately stacking major and minor thirds on top of each<br/>&gt; &gt; other, one will hit the following scale degrees:<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; 1 3 5 maj7 9 #11 13 #15<br/>&gt; &gt; C E G B D F# A C# (12-tet notation)<br/>&gt; &gt; C E- G B- D F#- A C#- (72-tet notation - what it should be)<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; Classical jazz theory doesn&apos;t usually mention 3rd octave chord<br/>&gt; &gt; extensions, but as someone who is currently studying jazz<br/>&gt; &gt; piano, that chord is talked about often. I hear it in classical<br/>&gt; &gt; music as well -- maybe not voiced that way, but at least I hear<br/>&gt; &gt; that #15 note is used fairly often. Also, the C# that is a #15<br/>&gt; &gt; here will differ from the normal C# that is a chromatic semitone<br/>&gt; &gt; by a syntonic comma (the #15 is lower). You would expect this<br/>&gt; &gt; C# to be accessed in relation to C in 72-tet as a C#-, one step<br/>&gt; &gt; down from the standard 12-tet C#, but due to accumulated<br/>&gt; &gt; rounding errors, it actually ends up one 72-tet step higher<br/>&gt; &gt; from where it would be. [snip]<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; To my mind, the only problem would be if the consonances in<br/>&gt; this chord couldn&apos;t all take their best 72-ET tunings at once.<br/>&gt; The consonances are, I presume, 3:2, 5:4, and 6:5.  The best<br/>&gt; tunings of these in 72-ET are 42, 23, and 19 steps.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; First let&apos;s examine the chord in 12-ET:<br/>&gt; [This is best viewed in a constant-width font - see &quot;message<br/>&gt; options&quot; to the right of this message on Yahoo&apos;s web site.]<br/>&gt; C   E   G   B   D   F#  A   C#  note name<br/>&gt; 0   4   7   11  14  18  21  25  steps<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; The consonances in 12-ET are 7, 4, and 3 steps.  So let&apos;s<br/>&gt; check the 3rds...<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; C-E should be 4 and is 4<br/>&gt; E-G should be 3 and is 3<br/>&gt; G-B should be 4 and is 4<br/>&gt; B-D should be 3 and is 3<br/>&gt; D-F# should be 4 and is 4<br/>&gt; F#-A should be 3 and is 3<br/>&gt; A-C# should be 4 and is 4<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; A-OK.  Now the 5ths...<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; C-G should be 7 and is 7<br/>&gt; E-B should be 7 and is 7<br/>&gt; G-D should be 7 and is 7<br/>&gt; B-F# should be 7 and is 7<br/>&gt; D-A should be 7 and is 7<br/>&gt; F#-C# should be 7 and is 7<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Alright.  Now let&apos;s tune the thirds in 72-ET so they&apos;ll be<br/>&gt; right...<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; C   E   G   B   D   F#  A   C#  note name<br/>&gt;   M   m   M   m   M   m   M     3rd quality<br/>&gt; 0  23  42  65  84  107 126 149<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; ...and then check the 5ths...<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; C-G should be 42 and is 42  *OK*<br/>&gt; E-B should be 42 and is 42  *OK*<br/>&gt; G-D should be 42 and is 42  *OK*<br/>&gt; B-F# should be 42 and is 42  *OK*<br/>&gt; D-A should be 42 and is 42  *OK*<br/>&gt; F#-C# should be 42 and is 42  *OK*<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; So I don&apos;t see a problem.  The chord should work just like<br/>&gt; it does in 12-ET, but with the advantage of the better<br/>&gt; tunings of 72.  If you tune it the way I did (sorry I don&apos;t<br/>&gt; know Simms notation) does it sound good?  Better or worse<br/>&gt; than in 12-ET in your opinion?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Can you show us what you find confusing?  Are you thinking<br/>&gt; in terms of approximating the 135 directly?  135 isn&apos;t<br/>&gt; itself a consonance, so I wouldn&apos;t worry about that.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; -Carl<br/>&gt;</p><p>Carl, this is where I claim that psychology trumps math.

He had a feeling of cognitive<br/>dissonance - that what he was experiencing was not as he expected.  I<br/>fully believe it is possible he could change his expectations and<br/>eliminate any issue.  However, perhaps the exact experience he desires<br/>is one in which a particular interval or absolute pitch that he<br/>expects in his mind is realized a certain way that 72ET cannot do.  In<br/>that case, 72ET fails for his particularly quirky way of creating his<br/>expectations of pitch.  There&apos;s nothing wrong with him being that way,<br/>but it would be an error if he thought any normal listener would care<br/>or notice or have his particular expectations.</p><p>-Aaron W</p></div><h3><a id=76658 href="#76658">ðŸ”—</a>Carl Lumma &#x3C;carl@...&#x3E;</h3><span>5/26/2008 3:34:09 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Aaron wrote...<br/>&gt; Carl, this is where I claim that psychology trumps math.<br/>&gt; You are clearly correct that there is no substantial issue<br/>&gt; here in terms of mathematical consonance.

And because of that, you<br/>&gt; &gt; can&apos;t easily make it be the case in a random listener&apos;s mind.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Oh yes you can. If I play the chord C E F# B D#, that D# will be heard<br/>&gt; by most people as a major third above the B, because of that F# B D#<br/>&gt; upper structure. It will not be heard as a 6/5 Eb above the C. Music<br/>&gt; is mainly how to get people to hear things in the way that you want.<br/>&gt;</p><p>Mike, this is true to a degree.  However, any trained musicians will<br/>impose very substantial bias on their listening, and any untrained<br/>musician will either not notice these things as much or be biased by<br/>their stylistic experience and focus.  Timbre plays a large part as<br/>well.  Most untrained musicians will not hear that chord as any of the<br/>versions you mention, they won&apos;t conceptualize the harmonies at all,<br/>they&apos;ll probably think more about the overall tone quality of the<br/>sound - is it restless?  Is it relaxing?  etc.  And most likely the<br/>way they feel the D# will be very strongly - primarily even - based on<br/>what the surrounding context is.  And if it is a complex context<br/>within a complex musical style then people used to that style will<br/>relate it to similar experiences in past hearings, and people not used<br/>to the style will probably dislike the whole thing or just not really<br/>judge it and just see it as complex and confusing.</p><p>I think something like this discussion came up right when I&apos;d just got<br/>the TPX and hadn&apos;t learned to operate it yet... I just played around<br/>with your example chord, and I can be certain that while you are<br/>generally correct the major third on top takes prominence, the whole<br/>chord, played as a big chunk sounds vague and uncertain.  I have to<br/>clarify things by playing pieces of it or arpeggiating to kind of<br/>focus my mind around the harmony.</p><p>Anyway, I agree about the root issue as you mentioned it.  A stack of<br/>fifths does relate each to the next and not necessarily to the root,<br/>but you&apos;re now talking about chords that are many octaves wide.<br/>There&apos;s no chance it is experienced as a fused, unified singular chord<br/>by the average listener.  They will hear both the little harmonies<br/>between notes and they will hear a complex whole ensemble sound and<br/>they&apos;ll hear the independent notes.  Trying to name it as a single<br/>chord is not really descriptive in my mind.  If we play two recorded<br/>songs at once, or say a jazz bass line and a flute solo at the same<br/>time that have no particular pattern... it may be very interesting.<br/>But it doesn&apos;t create unambiguous unified chord sounds.</p><p>The idea of hearing a tempered note as though it were a just harmony<br/>is valid to a degree, but it is very open to interpretation and<br/>influence based on expectations.  Beyond that, it may remind someone<br/>of the right note, just like a blurry photo can remind someone of an<br/>object, but it is not ever the same experience as seeing the real<br/>object or a clear photo of it.  The restlessness of beats for any<br/>temperament do impact the overall experience and no<br/>guess-interpretation of what it should be will eliminate that.</p><p>-AW</p></div><h3><a id=76660 href="#76660">ðŸ”—</a>Aaron Wolf &#x3C;wolftune@...&#x3E;</h3><span>5/26/2008 3:49:23 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;Mike Battaglia&quot; &lt;battaglia01@...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; I can, on my Tonal Plexus, play very close to exact versions of any of<br/>&gt; &gt; the options you&apos;re mentioning, and the only ones that sound<br/>&gt; &gt; harmonically reasonable are the harmonic ones.

And the #15, as you call it, is the same note<br/>&gt; &gt; as a b9, which is a 17th harmonic, which is 17/8 or 17/4 (octave...<br/>&gt; &gt; whatever) of the root.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; One more thing to mention, this time from your first post:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; The #15 is NOT the same thing as a b9. On a 12-tet piano, it is the<br/>&gt; same thing. In 72-tet, it is not the same thing. In 53-tet, it is not<br/>&gt; the same thing. C# and Db are not necessarily the same thing.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I use the concept of a #15 to mean a note that is close to the 17th<br/>&gt; harmonic, but it is not. It is a major third and 3 fifths up from the<br/>&gt; root.<br/>&gt; The 17th harmonic has a different use and purpose entirely, although<br/>&gt; the notes may be very close.<br/>&gt;</p><p>Mike, since those names come from a world of 7-note diatonic scales<br/>that are either interpreted as pythagorean, 12ET, or 5-limit, there is<br/>no way to absolutely claim that your #15 name means anything different<br/>from b9, except the addition of one more octave.  Neither of those<br/>names are clear on tuning at all.  They just identify a general range<br/>within a 7-note diatonic scale.</p><p>I originally claimed it as the same because not only are they<br/>interchangeable on a 12ET piano, but they are both best harmonically<br/>tuned as 17th harmonic, therefore the same.  Any other tuning creates<br/>less of a sense of single unified chord.</p><p>Let me put it this way: these names are thoroughly inadequate to<br/>express subtly tunings.  By bothering to name something as a chord, it<br/>seems to me that it should make a unified concordant sound.  If it<br/>does not, then it must have some other function, which is possibly<br/>voice-leading or possibly something else.  Though your stacks of<br/>fifths ideas are valid, there is no way you can claim that traditional<br/>jazz chord names are or are not that tuning versus a harmonic tuning.<br/> All they really do is tell you which piano notes are included and<br/>they don&apos;t say much at all about the function of the chord.  I wish<br/>they did but there simply is not enough consistency in the jazz world<br/>to truly use them that way.  I&apos;d be interested if you have any real<br/>evidence of these names meaning any more than my simplistic reduction<br/>of them.  Sure, some people like you may claim they imply other<br/>things, but if there&apos;s no consistency, then I think it just just a<br/>false intellectual exercise.</p><p>To summarize: your musical ideas are fine.

For a better approximation of JI with the same number of notes, miracle[31] is a good choice (although the structure of the tuning system may take some getting used to).</p><p>If 31-ET is too many notes, there&apos;s always 22-ET -- which opens up new possibilities for harmony but at the same time is incompatible with many traditional chord progressions that take advantage of the 81/80 syntonic comma. Miracle[21] and orwell[22] are a couple of possible temperaments in this size range. One of the things that makes ET&apos;s easier to think about, on the other hand, is the fact that you can take any interval and start it on any note in the scale; you don&apos;t have to worry about how close you are to one end of the chain or the other.</p><p>Bosanquet&apos;s keyboard is a nice design because it can be so easily adapted for many of these ET&apos;s (12, 19, 22, 31, 41, 43, 53...) but there are other options. The Wilson Archives has a paper describing Larry Hanson&apos;s keyboard (<a href="http://www.anaphoria.com/hanson.PDF">http://www.anaphoria.com/hanson.PDF</a>), which may be a better option for 15-, 34-, and 72-ET.</p></div><h3><a id=76666 href="#76666">ðŸ”—</a>Carl Lumma &#x3C;carl@...&#x3E;</h3><span>5/26/2008 4:28:57 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Mike wrote...</p><p>&gt; I use the concept of a #15 to mean a note that is close to the<br/>&gt; 17th harmonic, but it is not.

One does not care weather one chord follows another and we have crossing of voices per se. It is more an extension of Saties way of hearing harmonies than Ravels or Debussy ( although this stuff was being played in New Orleans). Since Harmony is so non functional, one wonders why it concerns us more than say, melody. And here is where i have trouble with the JI world. I mean i can accept any combination of diatonic notes as harmony, and most everyone else can although i imagine Copland is too much for someone. i say let it take care of itself, except in cases where we are using to add color to the line itself, as above.</p><p>/^_,&apos;,&apos;,&apos;,_ //^ /Kraig Grady_ ^_,&apos;,&apos;,&apos;,_<br/>_&apos;&apos;&apos;&apos;&apos;&apos;&apos;_ ^North/Western Hemisphere:  North American Embassy of Anaphoria Island &lt;<a href="http://anaphoria.com/">http://anaphoria.com/</a>&gt;</p><p>_&apos;&apos;&apos;&apos;&apos;&apos;&apos;_ ^South/Eastern Hemisphere:<br/>Austronesian Outpost of Anaphoria &lt;<a href="http://anaphoriasouth.blogspot.com/">http://anaphoriasouth.blogspot.com/</a>&gt;</p><p>&apos;,&apos;,&apos;,&apos;,&apos;,&apos;,&apos;,&apos;,&apos;,&apos;,&apos;,&apos;,&apos;,&apos;,&apos;,&apos;,&apos;,&apos;,&apos;,&apos;,&apos;,&apos;,&apos;,&apos;,&apos;,&apos;,&apos;,&apos;,&apos;,</p><p>Aaron Wolf wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; --- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a> &lt;mailto:tuning%<a href="http://40yahoogroups.com">40yahoogroups.com</a>&gt;, Kraig &gt; Grady &lt;kraiggrady@...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; while what they call it is wrong, i do think the &apos;mistaken&apos; idea did in<br/>&gt; &gt; fact lead to people plying up thirds , i guess caused it worked.<br/>&gt; &gt; which lead to chords in fourths, then fifths and seconds even.<br/>&gt; &gt; Even Partch spaced his hexad in thirds, as a left over of this type of<br/>&gt; &gt; thinking<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Right!

Neither of those<br/>&gt; names are clear on tuning at all. They just identify a general range<br/>&gt; within a 7-note diatonic scale.</p><p>Yeah, there is a way. It&apos;s just how I&apos;m using it. A b9 would be a<br/>minor sixth up from the fourth scale degree. A #15 would be a major<br/>third and 3 fifths up from the root. A minor sixth up from a fourth is<br/>4/3 * 8/5 = 32/15. A major third and 3 fifths up from the root is 5/4<br/>* 3/2 * 3/2 * 3/2 = 135/32. Put in the same octave, 16/15 != 135/128.</p><p>In my opinion, calling 17/8 a &quot;b9&quot; is like calling 7/4 a &quot;dominant 7.&quot;<br/>They are roughly in the ballpark, but there is a difference. There is<br/>a system to jazz harmony. That&apos;s not to say that you can&apos;t use 17:8 in<br/>a b9 chord.</p><p>Actually, I just realized while typing this, who cares? Jazz numbering<br/>wasn&apos;t invented with microtonality in mind. I am drawing a distinction<br/>between a b2 and a b9 and a #15 because they all represent comma<br/>adjustments to me, just like a 6th and a 13 is a comma adjustment. If<br/>you don&apos;t like my numbering system, then for purposes of<br/>communication, we&apos;ll just abandon it. The main point that I am making<br/>about 72-tet is that this chord:</p><p>32:40:48:60:72:90:108:135</p><p>Is inconsistent in 72-tet, and I like that chord and I play it a lot.<br/>It is made up of alternately stacked major and minor thirds. If you<br/>put that chord into scala and round it to the nearest 72-tet<br/>approximation, you will see the pattern break down at 135. Accumulated<br/>rounding errors will have that note &quot;jump&quot; up to the next step. It<br/>bad. Me no like. Make think hard. If you keep the 72-tet approximation<br/>on, and change the last number to 134, so the chord becomes this:</p><p>32:40:48:60:72:90:108:134</p><p>just for the purpose of having scala round the last note &quot;down&quot; to the<br/>72-tet step before it, just so you can hear what it sounds like, it<br/>doesn&apos;t sound as clean. Also, being as jazz tends to go way way out<br/>into 5-limit JI space, then I assume there are other chords that will<br/>run into the same problem, and nobody is going to want to have to<br/>think about that. In my mind, that more than nullifies the advantages<br/>of &quot;easy thinking&quot; that 72-tet is supposed to provide. I haven&apos;t<br/>looked at 205-tet yet, and it might be consistent enough that it<br/>doesn&apos;t have this problem.</p><p>&gt; I originally claimed it as the same because not only are they<br/>&gt; interchangeable on a 12ET piano, but they are both best harmonically<br/>&gt; tuned as 17th harmonic, therefore the same. Any other tuning creates<br/>&gt; less of a sense of single unified chord.</p><p>I want the interval that is one major third and 3 fifths up from the<br/>root. That interval is best tuned as that interval, not as the 17th<br/>harmonic. Big numbers don&apos;t necessarily mean &quot;dissonant.&quot; You are<br/>basically saying that dominant 7 chords have to always be tune to<br/>4:5:6:7, which is not the case. Having 7/4 in there is one chord,<br/>having 16/9 as the seventh is another chord, and having 9/5 as the<br/>seventh is another chord. Why do you insist that there is only one<br/>correct way to tune this chord? It&apos;s like comparing 5/4 to 81/64.<br/>81/64 is not an out of tune 5/4. 5/4 is just 5/4, and 81/64 is 81/64.<br/>If I have learned how to use 135/64, then there is no need to pretend<br/>that it&apos;s dissonant because it&apos;s a 3 digit number and that I &quot;really&quot;<br/>want 17/8.</p><p>&gt; Let me put it this way: these names are thoroughly inadequate to<br/>&gt; express subtly tunings. By bothering to name something as a chord, it<br/>&gt; seems to me that it should make a unified concordant sound. If it<br/>&gt; does not, then it must have some other function, which is possibly<br/>&gt; voice-leading or possibly something else. Though your stacks of<br/>&gt; fifths ideas are valid, there is no way you can claim that traditional<br/>&gt; jazz chord names are or are not that tuning versus a harmonic tuning.<br/>&gt; All they really do is tell you which piano notes are included and<br/>&gt; they don&apos;t say much at all about the function of the chord. I wish<br/>&gt; they did but there simply is not enough consistency in the jazz world<br/>&gt; to truly use them that way. I&apos;d be interested if you have any real<br/>&gt; evidence of these names meaning any more than my simplistic reduction<br/>&gt; of them. Sure, some people like you may claim they imply other<br/>&gt; things, but if there&apos;s no consistency, then I think it just just a<br/>&gt; false intellectual exercise.</p><p>On the contrary. I&apos;m saying that there is no such thing as what the<br/>&quot;jazz chords&quot; are supposed to be. I&apos;m just saying I want a major 3rd<br/>and 3 fifths on top of it. The 17th harmonic won&apos;t give me that note.</p><p>I just followed the major 3rd/minor third stacking pattern and found<br/>out that the #15 was the next logical step.</p><p>C E G B D F# A C# = 1 3 5 maj7 9 #11 13 ______? #15 seems to be the<br/>continuation of the pattern. b9 would imply a different usage.</p><p>I suppose there are other things that #15 could signify, but having<br/>the chord with the 17th harmonic CALLED the b9 chord seems erroneous<br/>to me, as these chord names have in fact come out of boring old<br/>5-limit meantone diatonic scale theory. We need another name for the<br/>chord you are describing, in order to avoid communication explosions<br/>like the one that we&apos;ve had, in my opinion. Or call it a b9. But we<br/>need some distinction between THAT chord and the one that is a bunch<br/>of stacked fifths and thirds and fourths.</p><p>I believe that any interval on a piano can be psychologically<br/>interpreted as a whole bunch of different ratios depending on the<br/>context. You are absolutely right though, in stating that musicians<br/>put their own bias onto it. I would say that biasing the note that is<br/>C# to always be 17:8 is the kind of bias you speak of.</p><p>-Mike</p></div><h3><a id=76676 href="#76676">ðŸ”—</a>Mike Battaglia &#x3C;battaglia01@...&#x3E;</h3><span>5/26/2008 5:31:26 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>To Herman:</p><p>Yeah.

So numbers don&apos;t always give an immediate<br/>indicator of dissonance.</p><p>It&apos;s like a major 7th chord: 8:10:12:15. 15/8 seems like it would be<br/>dissonant, but since you can feel the relation between the 15 and the<br/>12 and the 15 and the 10, and then from the 10 and the 12 back to the<br/>8, you can then map out the 15 to the 8. This is how the ear learns to<br/>hear new ratios as being consonant that might seem dissonant if you<br/>just look at the numbers.</p><p>Anyways, if you put this chord into scala or the tuning software of<br/>your choice, and you look at the nearest 72-tet approximation of the<br/>chord, you&apos;ll see that the last note -- the 135 -- jumps up a step to<br/>the next note due to rounding errors that have built up as more fifths<br/>and thirds are stacked up. It is a pain to have to think about that<br/>while playing. In addition, what about other chords that are just as<br/>far out into JI space as that chord is? Where do they &quot;jump&quot; from step<br/>to step? I don&apos;t want to have to think about mathematical rounding<br/>errors when I&apos;m playing. That&apos;s the disadvantage of 72-tet for me.</p><p>Compare for yourself:</p><p>32:40:48:60:72:90:108:135<br/>32:40:48:60:72:90:108:134</p><p>Put both of these chords in scala and use the 72-tet approximation of<br/>each.

It sounds really good. So numbers don&apos;t always give<br/>&gt; an immediate indicator of dissonance.</p><p>What are you actually experiencing here?

I can tune 15/8 by ear,<br/>with a bit of luck and a spritz of Vitalis.</p><p>&gt; but since you can feel the relation between the 15 and the<br/>&gt; 12 and the 15 and the 10, and then from the 10 and the 12 back<br/>&gt; to the 8, you can then map out the 15 to the 8.

It&apos;s just how I&apos;m using it. A b9 would be a<br/>&gt; minor sixth up from the fourth scale degree. A #15 would be a major<br/>&gt; third and 3 fifths up from the root. A minor sixth up from a fourth is<br/>&gt; 4/3 * 8/5 = 32/15. A major third and 3 fifths up from the root is 5/4<br/>&gt; * 3/2 * 3/2 * 3/2 = 135/32. Put in the same octave, 16/15 != 135/128.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; In my opinion, calling 17/8 a &quot;b9&quot; is like calling 7/4 a &quot;dominant 7.&quot;<br/>&gt; They are roughly in the ballpark, but there is a difference. There is<br/>&gt; a system to jazz harmony. That&apos;s not to say that you can&apos;t use 17:8 in<br/>&gt; a b9 chord.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Actually, I just realized while typing this, who cares? Jazz numbering<br/>&gt; wasn&apos;t invented with microtonality in mind. I am drawing a distinction<br/>&gt; between a b2 and a b9 and a #15 because they all represent comma<br/>&gt; adjustments to me, just like a 6th and a 13 is a comma adjustment. If<br/>&gt; you don&apos;t like my numbering system, then for purposes of<br/>&gt; communication, we&apos;ll just abandon it. The main point that I am making<br/>&gt; about 72-tet is that this chord:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; 32:40:48:60:72:90:108:135<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Is inconsistent in 72-tet, and I like that chord and I play it a lot.<br/>&gt; It is made up of alternately stacked major and minor thirds. If you<br/>&gt; put that chord into scala and round it to the nearest 72-tet<br/>&gt; approximation, you will see the pattern break down at 135. Accumulated<br/>&gt; rounding errors will have that note &quot;jump&quot; up to the next step. It<br/>&gt; bad. Me no like. Make think hard. If you keep the 72-tet approximation<br/>&gt; on, and change the last number to 134, so the chord becomes this:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; 32:40:48:60:72:90:108:134<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; just for the purpose of having scala round the last note &quot;down&quot; to the<br/>&gt; 72-tet step before it, just so you can hear what it sounds like, it<br/>&gt; doesn&apos;t sound as clean. Also, being as jazz tends to go way way out<br/>&gt; into 5-limit JI space, then I assume there are other chords that will<br/>&gt; run into the same problem, and nobody is going to want to have to<br/>&gt; think about that. In my mind, that more than nullifies the advantages<br/>&gt; of &quot;easy thinking&quot; that 72-tet is supposed to provide. I haven&apos;t<br/>&gt; looked at 205-tet yet, and it might be consistent enough that it<br/>&gt; doesn&apos;t have this problem.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; I originally claimed it as the same because not only are they<br/>&gt; &gt; interchangeable on a 12ET piano, but they are both best harmonically<br/>&gt; &gt; tuned as 17th harmonic, therefore the same. Any other tuning creates<br/>&gt; &gt; less of a sense of single unified chord.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I want the interval that is one major third and 3 fifths up from the<br/>&gt; root. That interval is best tuned as that interval, not as the 17th<br/>&gt; harmonic. Big numbers don&apos;t necessarily mean &quot;dissonant.&quot; You are<br/>&gt; basically saying that dominant 7 chords have to always be tune to<br/>&gt; 4:5:6:7, which is not the case. Having 7/4 in there is one chord,<br/>&gt; having 16/9 as the seventh is another chord, and having 9/5 as the<br/>&gt; seventh is another chord. Why do you insist that there is only one<br/>&gt; correct way to tune this chord? It&apos;s like comparing 5/4 to 81/64.<br/>&gt; 81/64 is not an out of tune 5/4. 5/4 is just 5/4, and 81/64 is 81/64.<br/>&gt; If I have learned how to use 135/64, then there is no need to pretend<br/>&gt; that it&apos;s dissonant because it&apos;s a 3 digit number and that I &quot;really&quot;<br/>&gt; want 17/8.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; Let me put it this way: these names are thoroughly inadequate to<br/>&gt; &gt; express subtly tunings. By bothering to name something as a chord, &gt; it<br/>&gt; &gt; seems to me that it should make a unified concordant sound. If it<br/>&gt; &gt; does not, then it must have some other function, which is possibly<br/>&gt; &gt; voice-leading or possibly something else. Though your stacks of<br/>&gt; &gt; fifths ideas are valid, there is no way you can claim that &gt; traditional<br/>&gt; &gt; jazz chord names are or are not that tuning versus a harmonic &gt; tuning.<br/>&gt; &gt; All they really do is tell you which piano notes are included and<br/>&gt; &gt; they don&apos;t say much at all about the function of the chord. I wish<br/>&gt; &gt; they did but there simply is not enough consistency in the jazz &gt; world<br/>&gt; &gt; to truly use them that way. I&apos;d be interested if you have any real<br/>&gt; &gt; evidence of these names meaning any more than my simplistic &gt; reduction<br/>&gt; &gt; of them. Sure, some people like you may claim they imply other<br/>&gt; &gt; things, but if there&apos;s no consistency, then I think it just just a<br/>&gt; &gt; false intellectual exercise.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; On the contrary. I&apos;m saying that there is no such thing as what the<br/>&gt; &quot;jazz chords&quot; are supposed to be. I&apos;m just saying I want a major 3rd<br/>&gt; and 3 fifths on top of it. The 17th harmonic won&apos;t give me that note.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I just followed the major 3rd/minor third stacking pattern and found<br/>&gt; out that the #15 was the next logical step.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; C E G B D F# A C# = 1 3 5 maj7 9 #11 13 ______? #15 seems to be the<br/>&gt; continuation of the pattern. b9 would imply a different usage.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I suppose there are other things that #15 could signify, but having<br/>&gt; the chord with the 17th harmonic CALLED the b9 chord seems erroneous<br/>&gt; to me, as these chord names have in fact come out of boring old<br/>&gt; 5-limit meantone diatonic scale theory. We need another name for the<br/>&gt; chord you are describing, in order to avoid communication explosions<br/>&gt; like the one that we&apos;ve had, in my opinion. Or call it a b9. But we<br/>&gt; need some distinction between THAT chord and the one that is a bunch<br/>&gt; of stacked fifths and thirds and fourths.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I believe that any interval on a piano can be psychologically<br/>&gt; interpreted as a whole bunch of different ratios depending on the<br/>&gt; context. You are absolutely right though, in stating that musicians<br/>&gt; put their own bias onto it. I would say that biasing the note that is<br/>&gt; C# to always be 17:8 is the kind of bias you speak of.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; -Mike<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>Charles Lucy<br/>lucy@...</p><p>- Promoting global harmony through LucyTuning -</p><p>for information on LucyTuning go to:<br/><a href="http://www.lucytune.com">http://www.lucytune.com</a></p><p>For LucyTuned Lullabies go to:<br/><a href="http://www.lullabies.co.uk">http://www.lullabies.co.uk</a></p></div><h3><a id=76684 href="#76684">ðŸ”—</a>Aaron Wolf &#x3C;wolftune@...&#x3E;</h3><span>5/26/2008 6:44:47 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;Mike Battaglia&quot; &lt;battaglia01@...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I can see I&apos;ve opened the can of worms here.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; Mike, since those names come from a world of 7-note diatonic scales<br/>&gt; &gt; that are either interpreted as pythagorean, 12ET, or 5-limit, there is<br/>&gt; &gt; no way to absolutely claim that your #15 name means anything different<br/>&gt; &gt; from b9, except the addition of one more octave.

It is FINE for you to talk about a #15,<br/>and fine for you to say that YOU would like it to be tuned a<br/>particular way.</p><p>&gt; The main point that I am making<br/>&gt; about 72-tet is that this chord:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; 32:40:48:60:72:90:108:135<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Is inconsistent in 72-tet, and I like that chord and I play it a lot.<br/>&gt; It is made up of alternately stacked major and minor thirds. If you<br/>&gt; put that chord into scala and round it to the nearest 72-tet<br/>&gt; approximation, you will see the pattern break down at 135. Accumulated<br/>&gt; rounding errors will have that note &quot;jump&quot; up to the next step. It<br/>&gt; bad. Me no like. Make think hard. If you keep the 72-tet approximation<br/>&gt; on, and change the last number to 134, so the chord becomes this:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; 32:40:48:60:72:90:108:134<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; just for the purpose of having scala round the last note &quot;down&quot; to the<br/>&gt; 72-tet step before it, just so you can hear what it sounds like, it<br/>&gt; doesn&apos;t sound as clean. Also, being as jazz tends to go way way out<br/>&gt; into 5-limit JI space, then I assume there are other chords that will<br/>&gt; run into the same problem, and nobody is going to want to have to<br/>&gt; think about that. In my mind, that more than nullifies the advantages<br/>&gt; of &quot;easy thinking&quot; that 72-tet is supposed to provide. I haven&apos;t<br/>&gt; looked at 205-tet yet, and it might be consistent enough that it<br/>&gt; doesn&apos;t have this problem.<br/>&gt;</p><p>Ok, I think I understand.  You want each third to be as close to 5/4<br/>and 6/5 as possible, and yet you don&apos;t want let accumulated errors get<br/>as big as 135/134 which is nearly 13 cents, thus making the<br/>accumulated errors in 72 necessitate either a bad 135/32 or compromise<br/>one of the thirds.</p><p>Now, in my view you really shouldn&apos;t care about the 135/32 ratio,<br/>because it doesn&apos;t sound that special.  It is not much different on<br/>its own that 134/32.  It is the harmonic support of each third<br/>supporting each other that is important, and so you should not<br/>compromise the thirds, just don&apos;t worry about the tuning of the<br/>outside harmony.  If you stop using scala to enter the exact ratios to<br/>get approximations of 7ET you won&apos;t have a problem.  If you had a 72ET<br/>keyboard, you would just be sure that each third is the same<br/>consistent number of steps and ignore how the outside parts of the<br/>chord relate - they&apos;re pretty far away anyway.</p><p>What I can tell you, however, about 205ET is that it does NOT have the<br/>problems you&apos;re finding in 72ET.  The accuracy of thirds and fifths in<br/>205 is better than that of 72.  I can play on my Tonal Plexus the<br/>exact chord you&apos;re talking about, and I can do it with alternating<br/>thirds of consistently the same shape on the keyboard.  The final tone<br/>C# is the precise key that is closest to the actual ratio 135/32.  It<br/>is about 1.5 cents off from the exact ratio.</p><p>Fact is, for your purposes it sounds like the Tonal Plexus and 205ET<br/>is actually more ideal than even for my purposes.  The thirds and<br/>fifths are particularly accurate, and the whole layout is designed<br/>primarily around Pythagorean tuning, meaning biased toward accurate<br/>fifths above all else, though it definitely isn&apos;t limited to that.<br/>So the TPX would do it for you, none of the issues you&apos;re bringing up<br/>here.  I checked.</p><p>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; I originally claimed it as the same because not only are they<br/>&gt; &gt; interchangeable on a 12ET piano, but they are both best harmonically<br/>&gt; &gt; tuned as 17th harmonic, therefore the same. Any other tuning creates<br/>&gt; &gt; less of a sense of single unified chord.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I want the interval that is one major third and 3 fifths up from the<br/>&gt; root. That interval is best tuned as that interval, not as the 17th<br/>&gt; harmonic. Big numbers don&apos;t necessarily mean &quot;dissonant.&quot; You are<br/>&gt; basically saying that dominant 7 chords have to always be tune to<br/>&gt; 4:5:6:7, which is not the case. Having 7/4 in there is one chord,<br/>&gt; having 16/9 as the seventh is another chord, and having 9/5 as the<br/>&gt; seventh is another chord. Why do you insist that there is only one<br/>&gt; correct way to tune this chord? It&apos;s like comparing 5/4 to 81/64.<br/>&gt; 81/64 is not an out of tune 5/4. 5/4 is just 5/4, and 81/64 is 81/64.<br/>&gt; If I have learned how to use 135/64, then there is no need to pretend<br/>&gt; that it&apos;s dissonant because it&apos;s a 3 digit number and that I &quot;really&quot;<br/>&gt; want 17/8.<br/>&gt;</p><p>Fair enough mostly. Except dissonance is not something completely open<br/>to opinion.  Dissonance is related to beats and a few related ideas.<br/>135/64 has more beats than 17/4, though they are far enough apart that<br/>it depends on timbre.  A sound that has a strong 17th harmonic will<br/>obviously blend well with 17/4 and not so well with 135/64.  However,<br/>if you build it up as you do with a series of fifths and then a major<br/>chord, then yes, 135 is less dissonant.</p><p>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; Let me put it this way: these names are thoroughly inadequate to<br/>&gt; &gt; express subtly tunings. By bothering to name something as a chord, it<br/>&gt; &gt; seems to me that it should make a unified concordant sound. If it<br/>&gt; &gt; does not, then it must have some other function, which is possibly<br/>&gt; &gt; voice-leading or possibly something else. Though your stacks of<br/>&gt; &gt; fifths ideas are valid, there is no way you can claim that traditional<br/>&gt; &gt; jazz chord names are or are not that tuning versus a harmonic tuning.<br/>&gt; &gt; All they really do is tell you which piano notes are included and<br/>&gt; &gt; they don&apos;t say much at all about the function of the chord. I wish<br/>&gt; &gt; they did but there simply is not enough consistency in the jazz world<br/>&gt; &gt; to truly use them that way. I&apos;d be interested if you have any real<br/>&gt; &gt; evidence of these names meaning any more than my simplistic reduction<br/>&gt; &gt; of them. Sure, some people like you may claim they imply other<br/>&gt; &gt; things, but if there&apos;s no consistency, then I think it just just a<br/>&gt; &gt; false intellectual exercise.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; On the contrary. I&apos;m saying that there is no such thing as what the<br/>&gt; &quot;jazz chords&quot; are supposed to be. I&apos;m just saying I want a major 3rd<br/>&gt; and 3 fifths on top of it. The 17th harmonic won&apos;t give me that note.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I just followed the major 3rd/minor third stacking pattern and found<br/>&gt; out that the #15 was the next logical step.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; C E G B D F# A C# = 1 3 5 maj7 9 #11 13 ______? #15 seems to be the<br/>&gt; continuation of the pattern. b9 would imply a different usage.<br/>&gt;</p><p>Ok, to you it has a different implication.  Here&apos;s what I think: I<br/>think that schooled jazz musicians who are told to think about<br/>stacking thirds end up thinking the way you do.  I think jazz or<br/>jazz-related musicians who rely less on theory and use their ears end<br/>up using the same piano chords, call them the same name, and really do<br/>not use them as stacked thirds in terms of the composition of the<br/>music.  I think that in the ambiguous world of 12ET, these chords<br/>generally are just used in two ways: 1. voice leading, and 2. just<br/>extra &quot;color&quot; sounds that don&apos;t really care which way you think of it,<br/>they just add extra sounds and make things denser in various ways.</p><p>Therefore, I think that your idea of naming and implication COULD be<br/>sensible, but it just in fact not an accurate description of what is<br/>going on in most real music.</p><p>&gt; I suppose there are other things that #15 could signify, but having<br/>&gt; the chord with the 17th harmonic CALLED the b9 chord seems erroneous<br/>&gt; to me, as these chord names have in fact come out of boring old<br/>&gt; 5-limit meantone diatonic scale theory. We need another name for the<br/>&gt; chord you are describing, in order to avoid communication explosions<br/>&gt; like the one that we&apos;ve had, in my opinion. Or call it a b9. But we<br/>&gt; need some distinction between THAT chord and the one that is a bunch<br/>&gt; of stacked fifths and thirds and fourths.<br/>&gt;</p><p>I agree we need distinction.  However, it seems clear from lots of<br/>usage that many if not most &quot;b9&quot; chords are functioning as solid<br/>harmonic units, implying the harmony 8:10:12:14:17.  But that is up<br/>for debate I admit.</p><p>My beef with your statement is the idea that 5-limit theory is<br/>informing jazz.  How can you possibly make that claim knowing that<br/>from the history of jazz to today the creators of this style had no<br/>option to choose anything other than 12ET theoretically.  Maybe they<br/>were trying for 7/4 and 17/4 and even possibly the 11th harmonic and<br/>just calling them by the 5-limit classical names that they appeared to<br/>be on the piano.  How can we possibly know?  They didn&apos;t, for the most<br/>part, realize that these distinctions exist!  If someone doesn&apos;t know<br/>the word &quot;orange&quot; and describes their style of painting as being<br/>entirely about the patterns between &quot;red&quot; and &quot;blue&quot; how can anyone<br/>say that they certainly meant red and not orange?  We can conjecture,<br/>but we can&apos;t know.  It is simply rash to assume that a jazz piano<br/>instructor, master, professor, whatever means exactly what you think<br/>he means harmonically when he explains jazz piano theory - if we also<br/>know that he doesn&apos;t know that these various intervals exist.</p><p>The real answer would only be to find really knowledgeable, old<br/>experienced jazz pianist with a really open mind who understand all<br/>the tuning theory, and can explain exactly how they experience jazz<br/>piano in relation to these harmonic alternatives.  My guess: they<br/>would say that 12ET works the way it does because it is vague and<br/>slightly dissonant and so it obscures a lot of these things and<br/>creates some tension that drives the music differently from any of the<br/>other harmonic options and they would refuse to either support or deny<br/>the traditional stacked thirds viewpoint.</p><p>&gt; I believe that any interval on a piano can be psychologically<br/>&gt; interpreted as a whole bunch of different ratios depending on the<br/>&gt; context. You are absolutely right though, in stating that musicians<br/>&gt; put their own bias onto it. I would say that biasing the note that is<br/>&gt; C# to always be 17:8 is the kind of bias you speak of.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; -Mike</p><p>I totally agree with this last statement with one exception: the piano<br/>intervals *can* also be interpreted (or non-interpreted if you will)<br/>as not being any ratio, but as being tempered, slightly dissonant<br/>sounds that are what they are and are distinct from any ratio.</p><p>Interesting discussion.  Glad to hear your views.  I was always very<br/>critical of jazz theory because I wasn&apos;t sure anyone actually really<br/>did stacking like this in jazz, I thought they just explained things<br/>that way because it was an easy pattern explanation based on the piano.</p><p>Best,<br/>Aaron Wolf</p></div><h3><a id=76685 href="#76685">ðŸ”—</a>Aaron Wolf &#x3C;wolftune@...&#x3E;</h3><span>5/26/2008 6:50:17 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;Mike Battaglia&quot; &lt;battaglia01@...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; Oh, are you wanting the C# to be a 17/8?

So your complaint isn&apos;t about consistency, but<br/>&gt; &gt; about wanting 136/135 &quot;in the kernel&quot; as some would say.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Not quite... I don&apos;t want C# to be a 17/8. I want the C# to be 135/32.<br/>&gt; In my experience, even though the numbers are huge, that interval<br/>&gt; sounds consonant if you play it like so:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; C E G B D F# A C#<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; And I already apologize about the stupid naming system that has<br/>&gt; already caused so many communication errors, but it&apos;s supposed to be a<br/>&gt; bunch of stacked major and minor thirds. Like so:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; 5/4 - 6/5 - 5/4 - 6/5 - etc.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Or, in just intonation,<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; 32:40:48:60:72:90:108:135<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; In my experience, even though 135/32 looks at first glance like it<br/>&gt; would be incredibly dissonant, when you put it into the pattern I&apos;ve<br/>&gt; described, you can relate the 135/32 down to the note before it to the<br/>&gt; note before that to the note before that and so on back to the root.<br/>&gt; It sounds really good. So numbers don&apos;t always give an immediate<br/>&gt; indicator of dissonance.<br/>&gt;</p><p>To be sure, 135/32 doesn&apos;t look to be incredibly dissonant.  Any time<br/>you have a really large number and a smaller number - basically any<br/>interval over a couple octaves, is rarely as dissonant as closer<br/>intervals.</p><p>&gt; It&apos;s like a major 7th chord: 8:10:12:15. 15/8 seems like it would be<br/>&gt; dissonant, but since you can feel the relation between the 15 and the<br/>&gt; 12 and the 15 and the 10, and then from the 10 and the 12 back to the<br/>&gt; 8, you can then map out the 15 to the 8. This is how the ear learns to<br/>&gt; hear new ratios as being consonant that might seem dissonant if you<br/>&gt; just look at the numbers.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Anyways, if you put this chord into scala or the tuning software of<br/>&gt; your choice, and you look at the nearest 72-tet approximation of the<br/>&gt; chord, you&apos;ll see that the last note -- the 135 -- jumps up a step to<br/>&gt; the next note due to rounding errors that have built up as more fifths<br/>&gt; and thirds are stacked up. It is a pain to have to think about that<br/>&gt; while playing. In addition, what about other chords that are just as<br/>&gt; far out into JI space as that chord is? Where do they &quot;jump&quot; from step<br/>&gt; to step? I don&apos;t want to have to think about mathematical rounding<br/>&gt; errors when I&apos;m playing. That&apos;s the disadvantage of 72-tet for me.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Compare for yourself:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; 32:40:48:60:72:90:108:135<br/>&gt; 32:40:48:60:72:90:108:134<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Put both of these chords in scala and use the 72-tet approximation of<br/>&gt; each. Forget the number values, and never mind the 134 at the end,<br/>&gt; just do it so that scala will round the last note down a step to where<br/>&gt; it &quot;should&quot; be for that 135. You&apos;ll hear that the first one sounds a<br/>&gt; lot better. So just ignoring the rounding errors and acting as if they<br/>&gt; didn&apos;t exist usually translates to a loss in chord purity, which<br/>&gt; defeats the purpose of 72-tet to begin with.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Just some thoughts.<br/>&gt;</p><p>The 135 doesn&apos;t sound better because 135 is better, it sounds better<br/>because the top pair are a good 5/4.if you take away the 90 and the<br/>108, you won&apos;t notice much difference in the 135 or 134 options any<br/>more.

Oh well.</p><p>Aaron and Carl: At this point I think we&apos;re all mostly in agreement. I<br/>don&apos;t think most jazz musicians think of tuning at all -- I myself<br/>have just done some listening tests to hear what I think retains most<br/>of the flavor of the original chords. I found that in a lot of cases,<br/>the chords are merely stacked fifths and thirds. There are other cases<br/>where I find 11-limit harmonies are appropriate, and other cases where<br/>I find 17 or 19-limit harmonies appropriate. I just found it to be the<br/>case that a lot of times, it really is just stacked fifths and thirds.</p><p>I happened upon this way of thinking when I tried to figure out why<br/>the melodic minor scale and its modes had a completely different feel<br/>from the diatonic major scale and its modes. The only explanation that<br/>made sense to me was that the melodic minor scale has two directly<br/>stacked major thirds in it, which the major scale doesn&apos;t have. For<br/>example, here&apos;s the lydian augmented scale, which is the 3rd mode of<br/>the melodic minor scale:</p><p>C D E F# G# A B C</p><p>The C and the E and the G# are two directly stacked major thirds. This<br/>creates the feeling of there being a 25/16 interval -- although you<br/>could interpret it to be a number of different things, I suppose. To<br/>me, it intuitively feels like 25/16. And that could be why the scale<br/>is considerably more dissonant than lydian mode:</p><p>C D E F# G A B C</p><p>which is its diatonic &quot;counterpart.&quot; Also, the modes of the harmonic<br/>minor and major scale have their uses as well:</p><p>C D# E F# G A B C - Lydian #9<br/>C D# E F# G# A B C - Lydian Augmented #9</p><p>Ignoring the names and numbres, both of these scales have a note that<br/>COULD be reached by going up two major thirds and a fifth -- and that<br/>is the D#. The lydian #9 scale has the normal fifth in the scale, and<br/>the lydian augmented #9 replaces the fifth with the major third on top<br/>of the major third.</p><p>Again, I think we&apos;re all saying here that any of these notes could<br/>approximate anything, but you certainly can&apos;t approximate [1, 2 &gt; with<br/>any of the notes in the major scale. And that is the difference.</p><p>Of course, I&apos;ve also found that the lydian dominant scale:</p><p>C D E F# G A Bb C</p><p>Is very well approximated by treating Bb as 7/4 and F# as 11/8, even<br/>though those intervals are up to a quartertone away from the original.<br/>So don&apos;t think I&apos;m &quot;biased&quot; towards 5-limit music -- the reason I am<br/>here is that I am not. :) I&apos;m just trying to recognize 5-limit music<br/>when I hear it, and figure out what a hypothetical 5-limit structure<br/>COULD BE, and 72-tet doesn&apos;t hold up very well for that at times.</p><p>So it isn&apos;t that I&apos;m getting confused. I&apos;ve compared the two chords -<br/>C E- G B- D F#- A C#- and C E- G B- D F#- A C# -- and the second one<br/>to me sounds better. Futhermore, I&apos;m not sure how this rounding<br/>&quot;bubble&quot; goes outward to other chords and upper structure triads as<br/>well, and I think that would be a pain for anyone to think about. Or,<br/>they could just not think about it, as you said, but I find that<br/>sometimes it legitimately sounds worse.</p><p>-Mike</p><p>On Mon, May 26, 2008 at 10:32 PM, Mike Battaglia &lt;battaglia01@...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt; Have you put the chord in Scala or some software?

To<br/>be honest, I just picked the first chord that I could remember having<br/>that issue in 72-tet. It also just raises the question of what other<br/>chords have this problem, especially extended voicing chords in jazz<br/>that go outside of the traditional #9/b9/13 whatever chord structure.<br/>Believe it or not, jazz musicians usually don&apos;t think about chord<br/>voicing numbers when they&apos;re playing. They usually just play, and<br/>sometimes they can end up pretty far &quot;out&quot; from the home key, but in a<br/>harmonically related way (and sometimes not in a harmonically related<br/>way). Are there inconsistencies in rounding there as well?</p><p>And let me be clear: I don&apos;t think in any way that harmony is nothing<br/>but a set of stacked 5/4 and 6/5 major and minor thirds. I&apos;m just<br/>saying that sometimes, chords ARE just a set of stacked 5/4 and 6/5<br/>major thirds. And sometimes, 72-tet doesn&apos;t handle that well.

And I assume any other<br/>reader here did as well.  You are the one missing something. Here&apos;s my<br/>guess about your confusion:</p><p>The value of 135 being exactly 135 is NIL.  Nobody will hear the<br/>difference in terms of that absolute.<br/>Just intonation matters in terms of CLOSELY RELATED harmonies.  Simple<br/>ratios.  High ratios are not perceptible as being just intonation.  In<br/>that regard, why should we ever use them?  Well, because maybe over<br/>time I do exactly what you&apos;re saying - but not all at once.</p><p>Let me explain further.  Let&apos;s say I play each interval - each third<br/>of your chord ONE AFTER ANOTHER as a series, not at once.  And let&apos;s<br/>say I tune each to pure JI.<br/>Then I might want a variation, I might have a set tonal center C note.<br/> And I might want to jump from it to the 135 note, and play each third<br/>as a series one-at-a-time in descending order, and then end up back<br/>where I started.  Clearly if I chose any note other than the 135 and<br/>still used pure JI, I would end up not where I started.  Hence the 135<br/>is important to this example.</p><p>However, 135 as a harmony is totally not worth caring about or<br/>discussing.  It doesn&apos;t make any particularly special harmony on its<br/>own.  It only makes audible harmony when the rest of the notes in your<br/>chord are included.  And EVEN STILL, it isn&apos;t relevant how it relates<br/>to the root, only how it relates to its harmonically nearby neighbors.</p><p>So the point is: it is not *crazy* for you to insist on not accepting<br/>the 72ET fifth error FOR EACH fifth - although most people think it<br/>sounds fine.  It is not crazy for you to say that the thirds in 72ET<br/>aren&apos;t JI-enough for you, but again most people think they are alright.<br/>BUT - if you are willing to accept the 72ET fifths and thirds as being<br/>on-their-own good enough for you - then you are simply making an error<br/>to be using 72ET but then calculating the whole chord example in JI.<br/>You should simply be calculating it using your already acceptable 72ET<br/>fifths and thirds, and it will add up just fine that way.  And there<br/>will be NO PROBLEM with the chord because each fifth and third will<br/>sound fine.  And the sound of that chord is TOTALLY IRRELEVANT<br/>regarding the 135, the only factor that makes that chord work is the<br/>blending of each third and fifth.</p><p>I&apos;ll put it another way.  If you used a different temperament that had<br/>the same fifths and thirds errors as 72ET but they were reversed<br/>(sharp instead of flat errors), your chord would probably for the most<br/>part sound fundamentally the same.  You could even mix them up.  You<br/>could tune one third a little flat, another a little sharp, and it<br/>doesn&apos;t matter what they add up to.  The whole sound of your chord is<br/>the sound of a series of acceptable thirds.  Comparing any two notes<br/>in the chord that are more than an ninth away from each other is<br/>comparing two notes that the listener is not hearing as directly<br/>interacting.  You&apos;re comparing notes that aren&apos;t relevant to the<br/>listener&apos;s experience.</p><p>There is no reason that you should be entering the JI chord into scala<br/>and then being frustrated.  Just don&apos;t do that.  Either use each<br/>interval as itself already part of 72ET, or perhaps choose to stay<br/>with pure JI and NEVER adjust it to 72ET, just play it on your<br/>computer in pure JI!  There&apos;s no reason to do one step in one tuning<br/>and the other in the other tuning.  Why are you trying to give<br/>yourself a headache?</p><p>Ok, look, I do sympathize.  You figured out some math of ratios and<br/>you see it creating a bad sound in 72ET although it sounds good in<br/>pure JI.  That&apos;s fair enough.</p><p>The real error is thinking that chords of &quot;stacking&quot; add up to unified<br/>wholes.  They do not.  Stacked chords like that add up to an<br/>interesting blend in which we can perceive each interval and they<br/>can&apos;t be totally pulled away from the whole, but the listener does not<br/>hear it as a unified, fused, single sound.  Harmonic chords, where<br/>every note is directly related to a single, simple harmonic series -<br/>those blend purely and fuse into a single sound when played in pure<br/>JI.  Your stack chords don&apos;t do that.  They don&apos;t do it in pure JI,<br/>and they don&apos;t do it in 72ET or 205ET.  They just don&apos;t.  So with<br/>THOSE chords, all that matters is that each diad in the series is an<br/>acceptable harmony.  It isn&apos;t relevant that it is *possible* to<br/>express it as a whole ratio series with giant numbers like 135.  They<br/>do sound neat.  Go ahead and use them.  But don&apos;t bother calculating<br/>their unified ratios, because that isn&apos;t how they are heard.  That&apos;s<br/>not how they work.</p><p>If you&apos;re still confused, let us know, but please trust us - we<br/>understood all along as soon as you clarified what #15 meant to you.</p><p>Best,<br/>Aaron W</p></div><h3><a id=76694 href="#76694">ðŸ”—</a>Graham Breed &#x3C;gbreed@...&#x3E;</h3><span>5/26/2008 8:26:22 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Aaron Wolf wrote:</p><p>&gt; Carl, Mike&apos;s complaint is that when he enters the ratios PURELY as<br/>&gt; extended JI, then the last note is rounded flat from what would be<br/>&gt; good in 72ET.

That is a totally unconvincing and<br/>empty hypothesis, but since it appeared to simply allow many things to<br/>have an explanation they went with it.

In a way?</p><p>&gt; C D E F# G# A B C<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; The C and the E and the G# are two directly stacked major thirds. This<br/>&gt; creates the feeling of there being a 25/16 interval -- although you<br/>&gt; could interpret it to be a number of different things, I suppose. To<br/>&gt; me, it intuitively feels like 25/16. And that could be why the scale<br/>&gt; is considerably more dissonant than lydian mode:<br/>&gt;</p><p>No - I think it intuitively feels to you that E and G# are - in<br/>certain contexts - a 5/4 implication.  I agree.  That doesn&apos;t make G#<br/>imply a 25/16.  It just doesn&apos;t.  See, that&apos;s the &quot;magic&quot; of<br/>temperament.  C to E can imply 5/4, but actually be a little sharp.<br/>When you then play E to G# it also implies 5/4, but there ISN&apos;T any<br/>implication that the root E is flatter than the audible note you<br/>actually are playing.

I have compared the chords with the C# being at 150<br/>and the C# being at 149. The C# being at 150 to my ears generally<br/>sounds more like that JI version, ESPECIALLY if you continue the<br/>pattern of major and minor thirds past the C#, when the<br/>inconsistencies become even more annoying and more obvious.

I thought your post was in response to my<br/>post right before it, in which I was quite irritated to discover that<br/>you thought I was in some way &quot;confused.&quot; I suppose you will respond<br/>to that post before I respond to this post, and the pattern will<br/>continue all night.</p><p>&gt;&gt; I happened upon this way of thinking when I tried to figure out why<br/>&gt;&gt; the melodic minor scale and its modes had a completely different feel<br/>&gt;&gt; from the diatonic major scale and its modes. The only explanation that<br/>&gt;&gt; made sense to me was that the melodic minor scale has two directly<br/>&gt;&gt; stacked major thirds in it, which the major scale doesn&apos;t have.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; AHA! So you admit to coming up with a hypothesis and then formulating<br/>&gt; music around it as though it were true - before rigorously testing the<br/>&gt; hypothesis and trying to disprove it! You are definitely in the<br/>&gt; jazz-theory tradition in that regard.</p><p>No. I came up with a hypothesis and tested it to see if it was<br/>plausible. It seemed, sounded, and intuitively felt plausible. This<br/>has really nothing to do with the concept of using 17 or 19-limit<br/>chords to imply b9 or #9 chords. That is another way to spell out<br/>those chords, and this is one way to spell out the melodic minor<br/>scale.</p><p>What I&apos;m saying is that the melodic minor scale could be ANYTHING. It<br/>could be a LOT of things. You could look at as a rational intonation<br/>version that approximates equal temperament, or you could look at it<br/>as irrational intervals, or whatever. You could also look at it as<br/>containing two stacked 5/4 thirds, which is just as valid an approach<br/>as the rest of these.</p><p>In my mind, the context that the notes are used psychologically clues<br/>you in to what JI interval they approximate, or if they even<br/>approximate a JI interval at all. And by screwing around with JI<br/>chords that incorporate 25/16, I get the same &quot;feeling&quot; that I do with<br/>the equal tempered melodic minor scale.</p><p>&gt; That&apos;s how I think jazz theory started - someone hypothesized that the<br/>&gt; whole reason even 7th chords existed was that they were<br/>&gt; every-other-note on the piano. That is a totally unconvincing and<br/>&gt; empty hypothesis, but since it appeared to simply allow many things to<br/>&gt; have an explanation they went with it. And when it didn&apos;t work so<br/>&gt; well (11 chords aren&apos;t the most popular) they just made up exceptions<br/>&gt; like please consider leaving out the 11 when playing 13 chords...</p><p>Correct. I am studying jazz piano at school, and this is predominantly<br/>how it is taught, and it is extremely irritating. Why 11 chords sound<br/>so weird is something I&apos;m currently trying to figure out.</p><p>&gt; And yet, some interesting music and harmonies did come into play as a<br/>&gt; result of blind faith in this crappy original explanation.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Ok, that&apos;s a little simplistic of a history - but you see how you were<br/>&gt; doing the same thing? In a way?</p><p>Again, I never said that I was taking all of music theory and fitting<br/>it into the narrow view that is stacked major and minor thirds. I&apos;m<br/>saying that stacked major and minor thirds exist, and thus they should<br/>be explored. You for some reason think that I&apos;m excluding higher limit<br/>harmonies or something, which I keep saying that I am not.</p><p>&gt;&gt; C D E F# G# A B C<br/>&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt; The C and the E and the G# are two directly stacked major thirds. This<br/>&gt;&gt; creates the feeling of there being a 25/16 interval -- although you<br/>&gt;&gt; could interpret it to be a number of different things, I suppose. To<br/>&gt;&gt; me, it intuitively feels like 25/16. And that could be why the scale<br/>&gt;&gt; is considerably more dissonant than lydian mode:<br/>&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; No - I think it intuitively feels to you that E and G# are - in<br/>&gt; certain contexts - a 5/4 implication. I agree. That doesn&apos;t make G#<br/>&gt; imply a 25/16. It just doesn&apos;t. See, that&apos;s the &quot;magic&quot; of<br/>&gt; temperament. C to E can imply 5/4, but actually be a little sharp.<br/>&gt; When you then play E to G# it also implies 5/4, but there ISN&apos;T any<br/>&gt; implication that the root E is flatter than the audible note you<br/>&gt; actually are playing. The E of E-G# is definitely sharper than 5/4.<br/>&gt; So the implication you get from these three notes is the feeling of<br/>&gt; 5/4 in two places, but at the same time a feeling of being sharper,<br/>&gt; and of the G# being a MELODIC leading tone into the A, which is<br/>&gt; exactly why it is there in a scale called the melodic minor!</p><p>I don&apos;t see why C-G# can&apos;t imply a 25/16. If C-Bb can in certain<br/>contexts psychologically imply 7/4, even on a piano, then why can&apos;t<br/>C-G# imply a 25/16? The only structural difference between the melodic<br/>minor modes and the diatonic scale modes is that the melodic minor<br/>modes contain in them two stacked equal tempered major thirds. It is<br/>not too much of a stretch to see what the corresponding JI scale<br/>sounds like with two stacked 5/4 major thirds. In my experience, they<br/>sound similar, but obviously not equivalent.</p><p>I assume you think that I&apos;m some kind of JI nazi :P I am not. I don&apos;t<br/>think JI is the end-all be-all of everything. I was only picking one<br/>specific instance where I was trying to de-approximate 12tet to a<br/>theoretical JI root, of which there are a few. Take the ionian<br/>augmented scale:</p><p>C D E F G# A B C</p><p>You can play C E G#, which is an augmented chord, or F G#/Ab C, which<br/>is a minor chord. So relative to the root, the G# could be translated<br/>into JI as 25/16, or it could be translated into JI 24/15 as F Ab C.</p><p>&gt; And the reason the scale has its feeling might be more related to how<br/>&gt; the notes lead into each other than it does to any aspect of harmony.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I think the whole problem is that in trying to think of temperament<br/>&gt; and how it implies things, you are ignoring actual aspects of th<br/>&gt; temperament that also make it distinct from JI. Fact is, though some<br/>&gt; implications and relations are possible, nothing in a temperament<br/>&gt; sounds like JI, and JI can never sound like a temperament. They are<br/>&gt; not the same experience.</p><p>I don&apos;t think so. I&apos;m currently really interested in Charles Lucy&apos;s<br/>ideas on irrational numbers being the basis for intervals sounding<br/>good. That being said, it is still possible to attempt to work<br/>&quot;backwards&quot; from temperament to JI, as long as you realize that there<br/>is more than one way to work backwards. So it&apos;s like, I keep picking<br/>one possible way to work backwards, and you keep telling me that I&apos;m<br/>saying it&apos;s the ONLY way to work backwards, which I&apos;m not.</p></div><h3><a id=76705 href="#76705">ðŸ”—</a>Graham Breed &#x3C;gbreed@...&#x3E;</h3><span>5/26/2008 9:09:47 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Aaron Wolf wrote:</p><p>&gt; Interesting... for some reason I never took the Ztar&apos;s seriously.

But they still work as microtonal input devices because you have 144 total keys (or 150 if you include the open strings).</p><p>It is more comfortable to hold it like a guitar.  There&apos;s a &quot;tapping&quot; mode where it works like a keyboard, so you hit a key and it sends the note, rather than having to use the string triggers.  There&apos;s also a Mini-Z that doesn&apos;t have the triggers, and so makes more sense as a keyboard.  And there&apos;s a Z-Board which has two fretboards arranged to be a keyboard.  I don&apos;t like that idea because the keys are the wrong shape to hit from the front.</p><p>For 72ET the obvious way is to tune each string to 12ET and space them a single step of 72 apart.  That&apos;s simple to implement in a synthesizer if it can tune each channel differently -- no need for tuning tables.</p><p>You can also use miracle to get a subset of 72ET (or other tunings).  The best way I found for this is to tune each string a quomma (2 degrees of 72) apart, and each fret two secors (totalling 14 degrees of 72) apart.  But with fudging so that you keep within the 31 note miracle scale: get a secor (7 degrees of 72) between three strings and round up 5 frets to be an octave.  (In fact you only get 30 notes so you need to do something clever with a pedal to really get all 31.)  This may sound complicated, but it&apos;s based around decimal notation, so the mapping is</p><p>0v 0 0^ 1v 1 1^<br/>2v 2 2^ 3v 3 3^<br/>4v 4 4^ 5v 5 5^<br/>...</p><p>and so on.  There are good melodic intervals between the frets, you get inflections between strings so you can adjust the spelling, and the octaves are easy to stretch.  Each chord has interval has four different shapes because of the inequality in the mapping, but the intervals in each direction still sound the same melodically.</p><p>Another way is a harmonic mapping, following my 7-limit neutral-third lattices, which I mention here:</p><p><a href="http://x31eq.com/lattice.htm#11limit">http://x31eq.com/lattice.htm#11limit</a></p><p>                     Graham</p></div><h3><a id=76706 href="#76706">ðŸ”—</a>Mike Battaglia &#x3C;battaglia01@...&#x3E;</h3><span>5/26/2008 9:12:51 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Yeah.</p><p>Meanwhile, in my limited little musical bubble, I find that adjusting<br/>for the JI rounding errors that come up in 72-tet SOUNDS better.

From using 5-limit JI<br/>to built that chord, the last note rounds up to a different note in<br/>72-tet than you would expect by adding up the sum of the intervals.<br/>It&apos;s like a stained glass pattern: You have a shape behind the stained<br/>glass, which in this case represents the chord in question. And the<br/>stained glass in this case has 72 &quot;panes&quot; per yard, which represents<br/>an octave. And the panes seem to be lit up in a pattern of one every<br/>23 steps, followed by one every 19 steps, which is where the shape<br/>behind the panes &quot;comes out&quot; through the glass. But the weird thing<br/>is, by the time you get to the last &quot;block&quot; in the shape, or note in<br/>the chord, the pane in the stained glass window in which that block<br/>appears is one pane over than you would expect by continuing the<br/>pattern, because the shape behind the glass happens to come out there<br/>instead, because every pane has been slightly off with the shape in<br/>the background.

I<br/>apologize sincerely for the long length here.  In the future, you can<br/>see what post is being responded to by looking below the post at where<br/>the new one is highlighted below the one it is responding to.  I<br/>myself got confused a couple times during this exchange so I don&apos;t<br/>blame you.</p><p>I&apos;m going to use these things: --- to indicate change of subject or<br/>reply to substantially different post.  Hopefully that will help<br/>anyone interested make sense of this enormous post.</p><p>---</p><p>First- when I say you were confused, here&apos;s why (and it seemed to<br/>unfortunately have continued which means either I failed to<br/>communicate clearly or you chose not to calmly and rationally read my<br/>long post)-<br/>By &quot;confused&quot; what I mean is Carl, Graham, I and everyone else DO KNOW<br/>exactly what you think the problem is and what you prefer, but YOU are<br/>misunderstanding what I and others agree or disagree with.  I NEVER<br/>EVER said I prefer the 149 bad major third at the top.  When I said to<br/>ignore the rounding error - I mean ignore that entire approach and<br/>ignore being frustrated by it and just use the GOOD chord - the one<br/>that Carl said is obvious, because it IS more obvious than the other.</p><p>Let me try one more time to make the logic clear:<br/>You understand that in JI there is a Pythagorean comma, right? That 12<br/>fifths are not exactly 7 octaves?<br/>Ok, now let&apos;s say you are playing a song in 12ET on a normal 12ET<br/>piano.  Now let&apos;s say you have a progression that circles around the<br/>12 fifths 3 times (chain of 36 fifths).  If you entered that entire<br/>thing into scala as frequency ratios from the beginning to the end,<br/>you would be off by rounding error and be an entire half-step, and<br/>entire 100 cents off from what you&apos;d expect!  This is because the<br/>actual comma puts you nearly 30 cents off each time around the circle.<br/>Does that mean 12ET fails to do good fifths?</p><p>The whole point of 12ET is that it eliminates commas like that.  Which<br/>means that EACH time around the circle you should think of yourself as<br/>back at zero, not as though you are a comma away but approximating the<br/>best you can.  If you are in the world of 12ET, you can go around the<br/>circle as many times as you like and there are never any<br/>inconsistencies.  You KNOW that.  The ludicrous level would be to go<br/>around 20 or 30 times, but enter the whole thing as JI in Scala and<br/>then say - &quot;12ET fails, it rounds these things off and I&apos;m on the<br/>totally wrong key now!&quot;</p><p>The point is that 12ET does fail to *be* JI.  So what?  If you want<br/>JI, don&apos;t use 12ET.  If you are ok with the fifths in 12ET, then don&apos;t<br/>enter things in scala as a chain of JI fifths - enter them as a chain<br/>of 12ET fifths - then poof - no rounding error of course.</p><p>As I said before, if 72ET thirds are ok with you, then enter your<br/>chain AS a chain of 72ET thirds, not JI thirds and again, no rounding<br/>error.  And the point is that you can do this *in this case* because<br/>you expressly decided that you wanted to make a chord from stacked<br/>thirds, and in that sense you are not directly relating the outside notes.</p><p>If you wanted direct relation with the outside notes, you would tune<br/>the whole darn thing in relation to one harmonic series, and you&apos;d use<br/>17/4 for the C#, and 7/4 for Bb, and maybe even 11/4 for the F#. But<br/>that&apos;s not what you wanted, and I totally understand that you ARE NOT<br/>a fundamentalist who says one of those is right and the other wrong.<br/>I know you are open to both tunings.  The thing I&apos;m trying to tell you<br/>is that only the harmonic tuning has direct connection with the<br/>outside notes, the stacked one - valid as it is musically - does not<br/>directly relate the outside notes.  Therefore, if each piece of the<br/>stack is good enough, there&apos;s no reason to revert back to JI - just<br/>think of the chord as a stack of 72ET thirds.  We both are preferring<br/>the same chord - the one in which all major thirds are the same size.</p><p>In one post you wrote:<br/>&quot;And Aaron: I am not &quot;confused,&quot; nor is there anything &quot;I don&apos;t get.&quot;<br/>It is very easy to see that you are recommending that I just ignore<br/>the inconsistencies because you think that the end interval from the C<br/>to the C# is going to be irrelevant, and only the relative consonances<br/>will matter. As I have said a few times, I have tried that approach,<br/>and it doesn&apos;t SOUND as good.&quot;</p><p>And that sounds like you *are* confused.  You said you prefer 150 to<br/>149 in the example, and that&apos;s what I&apos;ve been agreeing with.  Clearly<br/>you think that by ignoring the error that I&apos;m suggesting you ACCEPT<br/>it.  What I&apos;ve been suggesting all along is that you ignore the error<br/>and just use the better chord - and stop frustrating yourself with the<br/>fact that it is an error.</p><p>To be one more time even more precise, every temperament has errors.<br/>If the third is flat, than more and more and more thirds will get<br/>continuously flatter from the whole series in JI.  This could be<br/>chained until you are more than an octave flat if you do it enough.<br/>Every single temperament will have this behavior.  But it doesn&apos;t<br/>matter because once you put yourself into the box of a temperament,<br/>you don&apos;t (shouldn&apos;t) think about the complete multiplication of JI -<br/>you just think about each piece of the chain being ok WITHIN that<br/>temperament.  Unless you are doing a truly independent harmony like<br/>17/4 that isn&apos;t a chain - it&apos;s a direct relation.  Only in that case<br/>should you relate back to JI.</p><p>Ok, I&apos;ll even simplify again: you should enter each third<br/>one-at-a-time in scala.  Let it do its rounding for the single third.<br/> Then use the rounded result as the starting place when you enter the<br/>next third.  Viola.  No problems.  Because each is slightly tempered,<br/>there will be errors if you wait to the end to round.  So don&apos;t wait<br/>until the end of the chain.  Again, this will happen at *some point*<br/>to any temperament, period.  But I&apos;ve given you a solution.  Do the<br/>rounding at each step in the chain and then proceed from there.</p><p>----</p><p>Mike you also said:<br/>&quot;In my mind, the context that the notes are used psychologically clues<br/>you in to what JI interval they approximate, or if they even<br/>approximate a JI interval at all. And by screwing around with JI<br/>chords that incorporate 25/16, I get the same &quot;feeling&quot; that I do with<br/>the equal tempered melodic minor scale.&quot;</p><p>The problem is, we don&apos;t actually have JI in our head as some natural<br/>absolute that we know even if it is unlearned.  We do have some<br/>concept of the unified sound of a simple harmonic series perhaps, but<br/>even past 16 it probably breaks apart unless many of the numbers are<br/>included.</p><p>I totally agree with the 25/16 in JI and the feeling of the ET melodic<br/>minor.  But I think it is because they both sound like stacked major<br/>thirds, and each third is like 5/4.  I expect - same issue and the<br/>long stacking above - that if you play around in JI with only the C<br/>and G#, without at ANY TIME playing the E, you will not find yourself<br/>gravitating certainly to 25/16 - you will find that it is one of many<br/>intervals that are hard to tell apart and basically just have the<br/>feeling of leading toward A.  It is only when you add the E that 25/16<br/>because a more obvious choice.  And if you make the E an 11/9, you<br/>will find a nice sound by using the whole augmented chord as 9:11:14 -<br/>which really only sounds good with all three, and is rougher with any<br/>pair, although 14/9 is decent and is *very* close to 25/16.</p><p>----</p><p>I really don&apos;t want this to sound condescending, I don&apos;t mean it to...<br/>but perhaps you would benefit from rereading my previous posts and<br/>trying to figure out where you misunderstood me - if you think you<br/>finally understand now.  If you could tell me any particular thoughts<br/>on how I could have been more clear, I&apos;d like that too.  I&apos;m only<br/>interested in having effective communication.</p><p>----</p><p>&gt; I&apos;m just curious though, to Aaron: where exactly did 205-tet, of all<br/>&gt; things, come into this? Why did the tonal plexus pick that particular<br/>&gt; ET to use?<br/>&gt;</p><p>205-ET and the origin of the Tonal Plexus theory is here:<br/><a href="http://www.h-pi.com/theory/foreword.html">http://www.h-pi.com/theory/foreword.html</a></p><p>The summary is that Mr. Hunt wanted not only good harmony, but to get<br/>average just-noticeable-differences so that absolutely any perceptible<br/>melodic motion would be accessible to the user.</p><p>Best,<br/>Aaron Wolf</p></div><h3><a id=76719 href="#76719">ðŸ”—</a>Mike Battaglia &#x3C;battaglia01@...&#x3E;</h3><span>5/27/2008 10:17:51 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>&gt; &gt; So I played around a bit with these two chords.<br/>&gt; &gt; Below is a .scl file for anyone who wants to try it.<br/>&gt; &gt; Just play all the notes of this &quot;scale&quot; together except<br/>&gt; &gt; choose only one of the highest two.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; The difference, though clearly audible, does not lend<br/>&gt; &gt; a clear preference for one or the other chord to my ear.<br/>&gt; &gt; With the first timbre I tried, the C#=149 chord sounded<br/>&gt; &gt; best.

I think 2500 cents sounds<br/>&gt; awful- it maybe wants to go up to 17/4, not bad, or even better in<br/>&gt; this temperament, 21/5. With a low M3 like this I&apos;d be shooting for<br/>&gt; making a pun at 21/5, tempering the fifths to suit. I would guess.<br/>&gt; Though of course I&apos;d also have a 7/6 in there somewhere, different<br/>&gt; strokes.</p><p>It might be just a matter of preference, but I will say that the<br/>example I gave was just the simplest one that I could think of that<br/>has -ANY- rounding error. 2500 cents and 2483.3333 are both about<br/>equally off, with 2500 cents being closer by about 3 cents. I think<br/>the 2500 cents one sounds better, but when I taste-tested these<br/>chords, I had put even more fifths and thirds in there to continue the<br/>pattern and go even further out into the 5-limit JI lattice, and once<br/>you get past this C#, things break down pretty quickly in terms of the<br/>relative order of the chord and the intervals.</p><p>Furthermore, people often build chords from other scale degrees -- as<br/>I had said somewhere in a previous post, it&apos;s not uncommon to hear a<br/>sus9 chord built from the b3 scale degree or a minor 9 chord built<br/>from the b7 scale degree to imply a &quot;phrygian&quot; sound. I don&apos;t remember<br/>if that chord was the one that had the rounding errors as well, but<br/>there were a few chords like that that were common enough that they<br/>were fundamental to my style of playing that had these errors. So this<br/>one particular chord I just picked as a theoretical demonstration of<br/>the concept I was talking about.</p><p>&gt; Just something maybe of interest to Mike- over the last couple of<br/>&gt; years, casually but slyly methodically testing unsuspecting non-<br/>&gt; tuning-nut folk by playing them different intervals and asking their<br/>&gt; opinions, every one, without exception, has immediately identified<br/>&gt; 7/4 as &quot;blues!&quot; or &quot;jazz!&quot;. Hmmmmmm.</p><p>Definitely. And they usually identify 11/8 as jazz and blues too. I<br/>think it has to do with the blues scale --</p><p>C Eb F F# G Bb C</p><p>If you hear this played on a saxophone or especially a trumpet, it<br/>isn&apos;t uncommon for them to actually USE 11/8 for the F# (i.e. they<br/>play it a full quarter tone flat), although I&apos;m not sure they are<br/>aware of there being a harmonic series basis to what they&apos;re doing.<br/>Same with the Bb, it is often played as a 7/4, and the Eb is often<br/>played a quarter tone up so that the interval between C and Eb is<br/>9:11.</p><p>Of course, us pianists don&apos;t get to hit those intervals :( but if you<br/>hear the blues played on a saxophone, or a guitar, or a trumpet, or<br/>anything that &quot;bends&quot; notes, you&apos;ll hear those things quite a bit.</p></div><h3><a id=76720 href="#76720">ðŸ”—</a>Mike Battaglia &#x3C;battaglia01@...&#x3E;</h3><span>5/27/2008 10:55:00 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>&gt; First- when I say you were confused, here&apos;s why (and it seemed to<br/>&gt; unfortunately have continued which means either I failed to<br/>&gt; communicate clearly or you chose not to calmly and rationally read my<br/>&gt; long post)-<br/>&gt; By &quot;confused&quot; what I mean is Carl, Graham, I and everyone else DO KNOW<br/>&gt; exactly what you think the problem is and what you prefer, but YOU are<br/>&gt; misunderstanding what I and others agree or disagree with.

However, I find it extremely<br/>annoying that I can&apos;t always build really complex chords just by<br/>thinking about it -- if I do that, I will end up usually with some<br/>kind of distorted chord that beats pretty badly, so I have to go back<br/>into Scala and put in the JI version of the chord I want, then see how<br/>it rounds, and adjust for rounding errors. This flaw is why I think<br/>72-tet is less than ideal for &quot;easy adjustment&quot; for musicians from<br/>12-tet, although I will admit that if there were real-world acoustic<br/>72-tet instruments, then this might not completely unnoticeable and<br/>not a problem at all. I don&apos;t know.</p><p>&gt; Let me try one more time to make the logic clear:<br/>&gt; You understand that in JI there is a Pythagorean comma, right?

This is because the<br/>&gt; actual comma puts you nearly 30 cents off each time around the circle.<br/>&gt; Does that mean 12ET fails to do good fifths?</p><p>Well, I&apos;ve never had a song that went 36 fifths out, haha. If I did,<br/>then I would have a similar complaint about 12-tet, I suppose, but 36<br/>fifths out is something that I&apos;ve never used. I&apos;ve never run into the<br/>problem, and I find that the psychological &quot;guiding&quot; of the ear back<br/>to &quot;0&quot; in the circle of fifths after 12 isn&apos;t much of a problem.</p><p>&gt; As I said before, if 72ET thirds are ok with you, then enter your<br/>&gt; chain AS a chain of 72ET thirds, not JI thirds and again, no rounding<br/>&gt; error. And the point is that you can do this *in this case* because<br/>&gt; you expressly decided that you wanted to make a chord from stacked<br/>&gt; thirds, and in that sense you are not directly relating the outside notes.</p><p>I&apos;m building them as stacked thirds AND I am directly relating the<br/>outside notes. If you hear a major 7th interval, your ear sometimes<br/>&quot;fills&quot; in the 3rd and the fifth so that in a way you perceive a major<br/>7th chord. Likewise, if we&apos;re in minor and I play a major 7th<br/>interval, your ear will fill in the minor 3rd and the fifth. After<br/>your ear &quot;learns&quot; how the major 7th is related to the root (by a small<br/>network of fifths and thirds), then you can directly relate the major<br/>7th to the root as well. Same with the major 7th and the #11 interval.<br/>In fact, the whole principle of chord voicings and harmonic structure<br/>is that you DON&apos;T have to have everything be voiced in thirds and<br/>fifths in order to make sense of the chord. You can move certain notes<br/>around and omit other ones to get different feelings for the same<br/>chord. I guarantee you that after messing around with that #11 chord<br/>enough, you will be able to directly relate the #11 to the root, which<br/>I&apos;m sure you already are -- and the same applies for the #15. It&apos;s a<br/>matter of memory, I think.</p><p>I will admit that the rounding of the #15 in this case is a bit<br/>trivial, because the #15 is directly between a 72-tet step. Ok, fine.<br/>I&apos;m just pointing out the concept.</p><p>&gt; If you wanted direct relation with the outside notes, you would tune<br/>&gt; the whole darn thing in relation to one harmonic series, and you&apos;d use<br/>&gt; 17/4 for the C#, and 7/4 for Bb, and maybe even 11/4 for the F#. But<br/>&gt; that&apos;s not what you wanted, and I totally understand that you ARE NOT<br/>&gt; a fundamentalist who says one of those is right and the other wrong.<br/>&gt; I know you are open to both tunings. The thing I&apos;m trying to tell you<br/>&gt; is that only the harmonic tuning has direct connection with the<br/>&gt; outside notes, the stacked one - valid as it is musically - does not<br/>&gt; directly relate the outside notes. Therefore, if each piece of the<br/>&gt; stack is good enough, there&apos;s no reason to revert back to JI - just<br/>&gt; think of the chord as a stack of 72ET thirds. We both are preferring<br/>&gt; the same chord - the one in which all major thirds are the same size.</p><p>Yeah, I messed around with it in scala, and for the one chord I&apos;ve<br/>been talking about, 17/4 does sound better than 135/32. I was just<br/>talking about a general concept, I suppose, of rounding errors that<br/>pop up relatively quickly in 72-tet, as opposed to in 12-tet, where<br/>you have to go out 26 fifths I think to hit it. But I guess that the<br/>minor beating produced by just following the 72-tet interval<br/>&quot;patterns&quot; and ignoring the rounding errors is probably not that bad.</p><p>&gt; And that sounds like you *are* confused. You said you prefer 150 to<br/>&gt; 149 in the example, and that&apos;s what I&apos;ve been agreeing with. Clearly<br/>&gt; you think that by ignoring the error that I&apos;m suggesting you ACCEPT<br/>&gt; it. What I&apos;ve been suggesting all along is that you ignore the error<br/>&gt; and just use the better chord - and stop frustrating yourself with the<br/>&gt; fact that it is an error.</p><p>Yeah. So you&apos;re saying to manually adjust for the rounding errors,<br/>which is what I&apos;ve been doing. It&apos;s just annoying to have to think<br/>about. Are you saying that I prefer 150 because it approximates 17/4,<br/>or that who cares why -- just use it? I just don&apos;t want to have to<br/>think about rounding errors.</p><p>&lt;snip&gt;</p><p>Anyways, I&apos;m not saying 72-tet is that bad. I&apos;m saying that good<br/>interval consistency is a plus for ANY temperament. You&apos;re saying that<br/>inconsistency is also an inherent part of any temperament. However,<br/>53-tet handles this chord nicely, and there is no ambiguity. And that<br/>has always been my beef with 72-tet.</p><p>I think we&apos;re in agreement on what is being said. I just have<br/>different preferences for 72-tet than you do, I suppose. I like using<br/>72-tet as it makes composition easy for me, as I can just use 6<br/>detuned midi channels and get on with my life. Rounding errors become<br/>annoying sometimes, and it seems to be a lose-lose -- if I ignore<br/>them, there are certain cases where it does sound pretty bad, and the<br/>beating kind of cancels out the flavor of 72-tet that I so much like.<br/>On the other hand, if I don&apos;t ignore them, then I have to manually<br/>adjust for rounding errors, which sucks. Oh well.</p></div><h3><a id=76721 href="#76721">ðŸ”—</a>Aaron Wolf &#x3C;aaron@...&#x3E;</h3><span>5/27/2008 12:24:26 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Dear Mike,</p><p>Part of the issue is I don&apos;t use scala.  I don&apos;t know how you are<br/>entering complex ratios in scala, getting rounding, and actually using<br/>that while creating real music.</p><p>Are you dealing with some context in which you are actually playing or<br/>writing music?  Or are you just fussing with theory?</p><p>With 72, in a real context, such as a real keyboard, you would play<br/>what you know as thirds and fifths, and you&apos;d end up fine.  You<br/>wouldn&apos;t be thinking in cents and ratios like 135, because that isn&apos;t<br/>how you devised the chord.</p><p>If you are composing with retunable, adjustable stuff on the computer<br/>- then you have no reason to settle for temperament if the sound you<br/>want is pure JI.  In other words, if you&apos;re willing to adjust a piece<br/>note-by-note you can have pure extended JI (to a decent precision<br/>anyway).  No reason to compromise and temper unless you want the<br/>vagueness and comma-elimination of a temperament.</p><p>If I wanted your chord, aside from using my TPX, I&apos;d actually choose<br/>to tune it as pure JI, and I&apos;d just leave it that way and never temper<br/>at all.</p><p>Independently, I like the sound of the same letters you&apos;re using tuned<br/>as matching a harmonic series, which is then ending at 17, but I agree<br/>and admit that is not the same chord exactly.</p><p>You missed my analogy about the circle of fifths.  You don&apos;t have to<br/>go 36 fifths OUT, as you say.  If you simply do standard jazz<br/>circle-of-fifths progressions without compromise (meaning JI) than<br/>each time around the circle you will go flat a comma.  Don&apos;t tell me<br/>you&apos;ve never used such progressions.  My point is you are used to<br/>doing that in 12ET and not complaining, even though doing that 3 times<br/>(pay attention, I&apos;m not saying it is one big chord, I&apos;m talking about<br/>over time) but you calculated the JI ratios over time in relation to<br/>the starting note, you would end up a half-step flat.  The point is<br/>that 12ET DOES TRULY FAIL to recreate the effect of JI series of<br/>fifths that goes flat and if you want a series like that to go flat,<br/>don&apos;t use 12ET.  72ET also has its own properties.  These TYPES of<br/>issues are possible in any temperament, but each temperament has its<br/>own peculiar issues.  205ET does not have a rounding issue in the<br/>example we&apos;ve discussed, but it does in other contexts I&apos;m sure, but<br/>with simply more notes, such errors are fewer.  In other words, 205ET<br/>is overall more similar to pure JI than 72ET, although it isn&apos;t<br/>particularly noticeable in many contexts.</p><p>See the real question is something you haven&apos;t answered yet:<br/>Do you hear a substantial difference between your preffered version of<br/>the chord in 72ET and the pure JI version?</p><p>If you do hear a difference, then you are quite right to say that 72ET<br/>isn&apos;t achieving something you want.  I do notice a difference and I<br/>like the JI version myself.</p><p>However, if they both essentially express the same thing to you and<br/>you don&apos;t particularly care about getting the JI version, then it is<br/>obvious that 72ET is functional for you and the error is only that you<br/>insist on relating it to JI even though you yourself are finding no<br/>musical value in doing that.  JI is significant but it isn&apos;t the<br/>absolute root of all music that everything must relate to directly.<br/>It took me a long time to accept that myself.</p><p>Best,<br/>AW</p></div><h3><a id=76722 href="#76722">ðŸ”—</a>Aaron Wolf &#x3C;aaron@...&#x3E;</h3><span>5/27/2008 12:48:26 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>By the way, what&apos;s so much better about the idea of the AXiS compared<br/>to the StarrLabs Uath-648?

I believe<br/>&gt; I&apos;ve identified a practical digital microtonal keyboard.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Since 1996 when I came to the field, the story has been the<br/>&gt; same: if you&apos;re a guitarist, for around the same price as a<br/>&gt; standard axe you can have a guitar with any number of<br/>&gt; frets/octave you&apos;re crazy enough to attempt to play.  But<br/>&gt; no such keyboard option has existed.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Instruments like the Starr Labs Microzone and Cortex Designs<br/>&gt; Terpstra Keyboard look excellent, but the prices hover in<br/>&gt; the $8K range.  Still less than an acoustic piano, but much<br/>&gt; more than digital keyboards.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Then H-Pi announced their Tonal Plexus.  It brought the<br/>&gt; price down to $3,000 (TPX6 + shipping case).  But its<br/>&gt; keyswitches frankly leave much to be desired (in my opinion)<br/>&gt; and its key layout is a bit unorthodox.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; A product that actually beat the Plexus to the market is<br/>&gt; the C-Thru Music AXiS.  It was discussed here in 2005<br/>&gt; already.  But it wasn&apos;t designed for microtonal music, and<br/>&gt; it wasn&apos;t clear how well it would work.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Well I&apos;m happy to report that it should work (thanks to<br/>&gt; their very responsive and knowledgeable staff).  For $2100,<br/>&gt; including shipping and flight case, you too can have a<br/>&gt; 192-note MIDI controller with velocity-sensing keys (unlike<br/>&gt; the Tonal Plexus)!  That&apos;s over 6 octaves of 31-tone equal<br/>&gt; temperament, and almost 5 octaves of 41-ET.  Not ideal but<br/>&gt; let&apos;s remember Western music was built out by guys like<br/>&gt; Byrd who played a lot of 3-octave virginals.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; The AXiS has 192 isomorphically-arranged velocity-sensing<br/>&gt; keyswitches that can be split into 3 zones of 64 MIDI notes<br/>&gt; each.  This means all you need is to run three instances of<br/>&gt; a synth like Pianoteq (which is just blowing my mind... I<br/>&gt; could live the rest of my life and never want another<br/>&gt; synth... by the way re. an earlier thread it works great<br/>&gt; with &gt; 12 notes per octave).  The only hitch is, you will<br/>&gt; need three .scl files for each tuning (one for each keyboard<br/>&gt; zone, unless your tuning happens to be periodic every 64<br/>&gt; notes).  This is a bit of a pain but nothing out of the line<br/>&gt; of duty for the average MIDI musician.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; If your pocketbook is a bit deeper, you can get an Opal<br/>&gt; Keyboard.  One of the creators of the AXiS broke away from<br/>&gt; C-Thru Music and created this company.  They&apos;re using the<br/>&gt; same size and shape of keys and layout as the AXiS, but use<br/>&gt; nice woods to build their enclosures and... CLAIM TO HAVE<br/>&gt; WEIGHTED KEYS.  The price is approximately $1500 more than<br/>&gt; the AXiS.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; On either instrument the keys are arranged in 21 columns.<br/>&gt; This means it&apos;s going to give you &lt; 2 octaves with the usual<br/>&gt; 12-row Bosanquet mapping.  However, it&apos;s perfectly possible<br/>&gt; to do Bosanquet-like mappings with 7 columns (3 octaves on<br/>&gt; the AXiS) or 5 columns (4 octaves).  However the most<br/>&gt; natural way to map to the AXiS will probably be with<br/>&gt; something that is closer to the &quot;harmonic table&quot; layout it<br/>&gt; was designed for.  Bill Wesley&apos;s &quot;array&quot; music proves such<br/>&gt; layouts are cool.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I was going to wait to post this until I had a chance to<br/>&gt; play the AXiS and/or Opal, but I couldn&apos;t wait.  That means<br/>&gt; it&apos;s perfectly possible that the actions suck.  Both<br/>&gt; companies claim they&apos;ll refund your money if you don&apos;t like<br/>&gt; their product.

My main<br/>problem with 72-tet is that I&apos;m trying to find an easy-to-understand<br/>microtonal system for people that don&apos;t know anything about just<br/>intonation or want to do any kind of math. I want to give people some<br/>temperament to work in that can let them hit higher limit chords, and<br/>although 72-tet seems like the obvious choice as it just comes out of<br/>12-tet, they are eventually going to run into this rounding issue as<br/>well, and I don&apos;t want to have to teach them JI theory and have them<br/>think about rounding errors, because if they have to do that then this<br/>system won&apos;t ever catch on. One option is to proceed and just ignore<br/>the existence of these rounding errors, and assume that the slight out<br/>of tune-ness will most likely not make a perceptible difference<br/>especially when everyone&apos;s used to 12-tet -- another is to find<br/>another equal temperament that doesn&apos;t have these particular issues.<br/>I&apos;m still looking for that holy grail, but if it doesn&apos;t exist then<br/>I&apos;ll stick with 72-tet -- 53-tet has its own issues, and I never liked<br/>41-tet all of that much, though if I had a midi controller that I<br/>could retune to see what these sounded like live... :P</p><p>&gt; See the real question is something you haven&apos;t answered yet:<br/>&gt; Do you hear a substantial difference between your preffered version of<br/>&gt; the chord in 72ET and the pure JI version?</p><p>Yes. the 72-tet one doesn&apos;t sound as good, noticeably. Other chords in<br/>JI manifest themselves in 72-tet as a slight warbling that I don&apos;t<br/>really mind at all. This chord, however, has a much different feel to<br/>it in 72-tet -- the top note is halfway between 72-tet steps.</p><p>&gt; If you do hear a difference, then you are quite right to say that 72ET<br/>&gt; isn&apos;t achieving something you want. I do notice a difference and I<br/>&gt; like the JI version myself.</p><p>Hallelujah.</p><p>&gt; However, if they both essentially express the same thing to you and<br/>&gt; you don&apos;t particularly care about getting the JI version, then it is<br/>&gt; obvious that 72ET is functional for you and the error is only that you<br/>&gt; insist on relating it to JI even though you yourself are finding no<br/>&gt; musical value in doing that. JI is significant but it isn&apos;t the<br/>&gt; absolute root of all music that everything must relate to directly.<br/>&gt; It took me a long time to accept that myself.</p><p>I think in JI. JI is what comes natural to me. I don&apos;t think in terms<br/>of numbers like 135, but I think of solid intervals that have their<br/>basis in a harmonic series. And then from THAT, I go onto other things<br/>like stretched harmonic intervals and sharpened leading tones and<br/>stuff generally in the vein of what you describe.</p><p>There are times when I do think in terms of irrational numbers, such<br/>as the giant steps progression -- I never heard that as a series of<br/>chords that go down in 5/4 patterns, but rather as a series of chords<br/>that go down exactly one third of an octave.</p><p>Before I get another onslaught of how it&apos;s useless to use temperament<br/>if I think in JI -- it isn&apos;t useless at all. I don&apos;t have any<br/>instrument with an unlimited range of pitches (although I have a few<br/>ideas for some), and so I have to use temperament. So I have to weigh<br/>the advantages and disadvantages of each temperament before deciding<br/>which one is the holy grail of Jesus or something. I don&apos;t mind errors<br/>in an equal temperament that deviate from actual JI values --<br/>obviously that is inherent in any equal temperament. But I find these<br/>rounding errors a little hard to swallow.</p></div><h3><a id=76724 href="#76724">ðŸ”—</a>Carl Lumma &#x3C;carl@...&#x3E;</h3><span>5/27/2008 1:20:04 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;Aaron Wolf&quot; &lt;aaron@...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; By the way, what&apos;s so much better about the idea of the AXiS<br/>&gt; compared to the StarrLabs Uath-648?

But they still<br/>&gt; work as microtonal input devices because you have 144 total<br/>&gt; keys (or 150 if you include the open strings).<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; It is more comfortable to hold it like a guitar. There&apos;s a<br/>&gt; &quot;tapping&quot; mode where it works like a keyboard, so you hit a<br/>&gt; key and it sends the note, rather than having to use the<br/>&gt; string triggers. There&apos;s also a Mini-Z that doesn&apos;t have<br/>&gt; the triggers, and so makes more sense as a keyboard. And<br/>&gt; there&apos;s a Z-Board which has two fretboards arranged to be a<br/>&gt; keyboard. I don&apos;t like that idea because the keys are the<br/>&gt; wrong shape to hit from the front.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; For 72ET the obvious way is to tune each string to 12ET and<br/>&gt; space them a single step of 72 apart. That&apos;s simple to<br/>&gt; implement in a synthesizer if it can tune each channel<br/>&gt; differently -- no need for tuning tables.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; You can also use miracle to get a subset of 72ET (or other<br/>&gt; tunings). The best way I found for this is to tune each<br/>&gt; string a quomma (2 degrees of 72) apart, and each fret two<br/>&gt; secors (totalling 14 degrees of 72) apart. But with fudging<br/>&gt; so that you keep within the 31 note miracle scale: get a<br/>&gt; secor (7 degrees of 72) between three strings and round up 5<br/>&gt; frets to be an octave. (In fact you only get 30 notes so<br/>&gt; you need to do something clever with a pedal to really get<br/>&gt; all 31.) This may sound complicated, but it&apos;s based around<br/>&gt; decimal notation, so the mapping is<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; 0v 0 0^ 1v 1 1^<br/>&gt; 2v 2 2^ 3v 3 3^<br/>&gt; 4v 4 4^ 5v 5 5^<br/>&gt; ...<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; and so on. There are good melodic intervals between the<br/>&gt; frets, you get inflections between strings so you can adjust<br/>&gt; the spelling, and the octaves are easy to stretch. Each<br/>&gt; chord has interval has four different shapes because of the<br/>&gt; inequality in the mapping, but the intervals in each<br/>&gt; direction still sound the same melodically.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Another way is a harmonic mapping, following my 7-limit<br/>&gt; neutral-third lattices, which I mention here:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; <a href="http://x31eq.com/lattice.htm#11limit">http://x31eq.com/lattice.htm#11limit</a><br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Graham<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>--<br/>Torsten Anders<br/>Interdisciplinary Centre for Computer Music Research<br/>University of Plymouth<br/>Office: +44-1752-586227<br/>Private: +44-1752-558917<br/><a href="http://strasheela.sourceforge.net">http://strasheela.sourceforge.net</a><br/><a href="http://www.torsten-anders.de">http://www.torsten-anders.de</a></p></div><h3><a id=76728 href="#76728">ðŸ”—</a>George D.

That&apos;s just the point.<br/>&gt; I think in JI, but I&apos;m looking for a temperament in which my JI<br/>&gt; thoughts translate to the temperament efficiently. 12-tet is good for<br/>&gt; that, but I can&apos;t get at all of the chords that I want. 19-tet I find<br/>&gt; to be a marginal improvement, and in some ways is worse than 12-tet.<br/>&gt; 31-tet is also pretty good, but I find the meantone fifths a little<br/>&gt; bit harsh sometimes. 53-tet is amazing for 5-limit stuff, but isn&apos;t as<br/>&gt; good for 7-limit stuff. 41-tet is decent. 72-tet seemed like the<br/>&gt; greatest invention on the face of the planet until I realized that we<br/>&gt; now have so many divisions that the accumulated error needed for<br/>&gt; rounding errors to occur is extremely small.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; If I wanted your chord, aside from using my TPX, I&apos;d actually choose<br/>&gt; &gt; to tune it as pure JI, and I&apos;d just leave it that way and never &gt; temper<br/>&gt; &gt; at all.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Alas, if only there were an instrument that could do that.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; Independently, I like the sound of the same letters you&apos;re using &gt; tuned<br/>&gt; &gt; as matching a harmonic series, which is then ending at 17, but I &gt; agree<br/>&gt; &gt; and admit that is not the same chord exactly.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Yeah. they&apos;re just different chords.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; You missed my analogy about the circle of fifths. You don&apos;t have to<br/>&gt; &gt; go 36 fifths OUT, as you say. If you simply do standard jazz<br/>&gt; &gt; circle-of-fifths progressions without compromise (meaning JI) than<br/>&gt; &gt; each time around the circle you will go flat a comma. Don&apos;t tell me<br/>&gt; &gt; you&apos;ve never used such progressions. My point is you are used to<br/>&gt; &gt; doing that in 12ET and not complaining, even though doing that 3 &gt; times<br/>&gt; &gt; (pay attention, I&apos;m not saying it is one big chord, I&apos;m talking &gt; about<br/>&gt; &gt; over time) but you calculated the JI ratios over time in relation to<br/>&gt; &gt; the starting note, you would end up a half-step flat. The point is<br/>&gt; &gt; that 12ET DOES TRULY FAIL to recreate the effect of JI series of<br/>&gt; &gt; fifths that goes flat and if you want a series like that to go flat,<br/>&gt; &gt; don&apos;t use 12ET. 72ET also has its own properties. These TYPES of<br/>&gt; &gt; issues are possible in any temperament, but each temperament has its<br/>&gt; &gt; own peculiar issues. 205ET does not have a rounding issue in the<br/>&gt; &gt; example we&apos;ve discussed, but it does in other contexts I&apos;m sure, but<br/>&gt; &gt; with simply more notes, such errors are fewer. In other words, 205ET<br/>&gt; &gt; is overall more similar to pure JI than 72ET, although it isn&apos;t<br/>&gt; &gt; particularly noticeable in many contexts.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Yeah. That would be the reason why I&apos;m looking to branch away from<br/>&gt; 12-tet :P And as I continue to search for a new temperament, I find<br/>&gt; that 72-tet has its own drawbacks, as you are saying. But accumulated<br/>&gt; rounding errors manifest themselves when working exclusively within<br/>&gt; 72-tet as dissonance that builds up over time, so that people think<br/>&gt; that chords like the #15 &quot;just don&apos;t sound good,&quot; when really it&apos;s<br/>&gt; just that this stupid rounding issue has occured again. My main<br/>&gt; problem with 72-tet is that I&apos;m trying to find an easy-to-understand<br/>&gt; microtonal system for people that don&apos;t know anything about just<br/>&gt; intonation or want to do any kind of math. I want to give people some<br/>&gt; temperament to work in that can let them hit higher limit chords, and<br/>&gt; although 72-tet seems like the obvious choice as it just comes out of<br/>&gt; 12-tet, they are eventually going to run into this rounding issue as<br/>&gt; well, and I don&apos;t want to have to teach them JI theory and have them<br/>&gt; think about rounding errors, because if they have to do that then this<br/>&gt; system won&apos;t ever catch on. One option is to proceed and just ignore<br/>&gt; the existence of these rounding errors, and assume that the slight out<br/>&gt; of tune-ness will most likely not make a perceptible difference<br/>&gt; especially when everyone&apos;s used to 12-tet -- another is to find<br/>&gt; another equal temperament that doesn&apos;t have these particular issues.<br/>&gt; I&apos;m still looking for that holy grail, but if it doesn&apos;t exist then<br/>&gt; I&apos;ll stick with 72-tet -- 53-tet has its own issues, and I never liked<br/>&gt; 41-tet all of that much, though if I had a midi controller that I<br/>&gt; could retune to see what these sounded like live... :P<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; See the real question is something you haven&apos;t answered yet:<br/>&gt; &gt; Do you hear a substantial difference between your preffered &gt; version of<br/>&gt; &gt; the chord in 72ET and the pure JI version?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Yes. the 72-tet one doesn&apos;t sound as good, noticeably. Other chords in<br/>&gt; JI manifest themselves in 72-tet as a slight warbling that I don&apos;t<br/>&gt; really mind at all. This chord, however, has a much different feel to<br/>&gt; it in 72-tet -- the top note is halfway between 72-tet steps.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; If you do hear a difference, then you are quite right to say that &gt; 72ET<br/>&gt; &gt; isn&apos;t achieving something you want. I do notice a difference and I<br/>&gt; &gt; like the JI version myself.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Hallelujah.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; However, if they both essentially express the same thing to you and<br/>&gt; &gt; you don&apos;t particularly care about getting the JI version, then it is<br/>&gt; &gt; obvious that 72ET is functional for you and the error is only that &gt; you<br/>&gt; &gt; insist on relating it to JI even though you yourself are finding no<br/>&gt; &gt; musical value in doing that. JI is significant but it isn&apos;t the<br/>&gt; &gt; absolute root of all music that everything must relate to directly.<br/>&gt; &gt; It took me a long time to accept that myself.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I think in JI. JI is what comes natural to me. I don&apos;t think in terms<br/>&gt; of numbers like 135, but I think of solid intervals that have their<br/>&gt; basis in a harmonic series. And then from THAT, I go onto other things<br/>&gt; like stretched harmonic intervals and sharpened leading tones and<br/>&gt; stuff generally in the vein of what you describe.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; There are times when I do think in terms of irrational numbers, such<br/>&gt; as the giant steps progression -- I never heard that as a series of<br/>&gt; chords that go down in 5/4 patterns, but rather as a series of chords<br/>&gt; that go down exactly one third of an octave.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Before I get another onslaught of how it&apos;s useless to use temperament<br/>&gt; if I think in JI -- it isn&apos;t useless at all. I don&apos;t have any<br/>&gt; instrument with an unlimited range of pitches (although I have a few<br/>&gt; ideas for some), and so I have to use temperament. So I have to weigh<br/>&gt; the advantages and disadvantages of each temperament before deciding<br/>&gt; which one is the holy grail of Jesus or something. I don&apos;t mind errors<br/>&gt; in an equal temperament that deviate from actual JI values --<br/>&gt; obviously that is inherent in any equal temperament. But I find these<br/>&gt; rounding errors a little hard to swallow.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>Charles Lucy<br/>lucy@...</p><p>- Promoting global harmony through LucyTuning -</p><p>for information on LucyTuning go to:<br/><a href="http://www.lucytune.com">http://www.lucytune.com</a></p><p>For LucyTuned Lullabies go to:<br/><a href="http://www.lullabies.co.uk">http://www.lullabies.co.uk</a></p></div><h3><a id=76734 href="#76734">ðŸ”—</a>Mike Battaglia &#x3C;battaglia01@...&#x3E;</h3><span>5/27/2008 7:10:25 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>From looking at 88edo, it has the same problem that 72 does, but worse<br/>-- two fifths is enough to cause a rounding error.

My main<br/>&gt; problem with 72-tet is that I&apos;m trying to find an easy-to-understand<br/>&gt; microtonal system for people that don&apos;t know anything about just<br/>&gt; intonation or want to do any kind of math. I want to give people some<br/>&gt; temperament to work in that can let them hit higher limit chords, and<br/>&gt; although 72-tet seems like the obvious choice as it just comes out of<br/>&gt; 12-tet, they are eventually going to run into this rounding issue as<br/>&gt; well, and I don&apos;t want to have to teach them JI theory and have them<br/>&gt; think about rounding errors, because if they have to do that then this<br/>&gt; system won&apos;t ever catch on. One option is to proceed and just ignore<br/>&gt; the existence of these rounding errors, and assume that the slight out<br/>&gt; of tune-ness will most likely not make a perceptible difference<br/>&gt; especially when everyone&apos;s used to 12-tet -- another is to find<br/>&gt; another equal temperament that doesn&apos;t have these particular issues.<br/>&gt; I&apos;m still looking for that holy grail, but if it doesn&apos;t exist then<br/>&gt; I&apos;ll stick with 72-tet -- 53-tet has its own issues, and I never liked<br/>&gt; 41-tet all of that much, though if I had a midi controller that I<br/>&gt; could retune to see what these sounded like live... :P<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt; See the real question is something you haven&apos;t answered yet:<br/>&gt;&gt; Do you hear a substantial difference between your preffered version of<br/>&gt;&gt; the chord in 72ET and the pure JI version?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Yes. the 72-tet one doesn&apos;t sound as good, noticeably. Other chords in<br/>&gt; JI manifest themselves in 72-tet as a slight warbling that I don&apos;t<br/>&gt; really mind at all.

JI is significant but it isn&apos;t the<br/>&gt;&gt; absolute root of all music that everything must relate to directly.<br/>&gt;&gt; It took me a long time to accept that myself.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I think in JI. JI is what comes natural to me. I don&apos;t think in terms<br/>&gt; of numbers like 135, but I think of solid intervals that have their<br/>&gt; basis in a harmonic series. And then from THAT, I go onto other things<br/>&gt; like stretched harmonic intervals and sharpened leading tones and<br/>&gt; stuff generally in the vein of what you describe.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; There are times when I do think in terms of irrational numbers, such<br/>&gt; as the giant steps progression -- I never heard that as a series of<br/>&gt; chords that go down in 5/4 patterns, but rather as a series of chords<br/>&gt; that go down exactly one third of an octave.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Before I get another onslaught of how it&apos;s useless to use temperament<br/>&gt; if I think in JI -- it isn&apos;t useless at all.

While ETs can modulate anywhere few peoples musical language do so. having even 6-9 good keys is allot to play with! Perhaps you might end like myself liking the other JI versions of these chords and end up using them anyway. As far as thinking then at least i know exactly what it is i am playing. This in turns leads to analogies in structure that can lead us elsewhere in unexpected ways.

That&apos;s all I&apos;m saying.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt; If you are composing with retunable, adjustable stuff on the computer<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt; - then you have no reason to settle for temperament if the sound you<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt; want is pure JI. In other words, if you&apos;re willing to adjust a piece<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt; note-by-note you can have pure extended JI (to a decent precision<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt; anyway). No reason to compromise and temper unless you want the<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt; vagueness and comma-elimination of a temperament.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; Well, I don&apos;t want to be stuck to the computer. That&apos;s just the point.<br/>&gt; &gt; I think in JI, but I&apos;m looking for a temperament in which my JI<br/>&gt; &gt; thoughts translate to the temperament efficiently. 12-tet is good for<br/>&gt; &gt; that, but I can&apos;t get at all of the chords that I want. 19-tet I find<br/>&gt; &gt; to be a marginal improvement, and in some ways is worse than 12-tet.<br/>&gt; &gt; 31-tet is also pretty good, but I find the meantone fifths a little<br/>&gt; &gt; bit harsh sometimes. 53-tet is amazing for 5-limit stuff, but isn&apos;t as<br/>&gt; &gt; good for 7-limit stuff. 41-tet is decent. 72-tet seemed like the<br/>&gt; &gt; greatest invention on the face of the planet until I realized that we<br/>&gt; &gt; now have so many divisions that the accumulated error needed for<br/>&gt; &gt; rounding errors to occur is extremely small.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt; If I wanted your chord, aside from using my TPX, I&apos;d actually choose<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt; to tune it as pure JI, and I&apos;d just leave it that way and never temper<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt; at all.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; Alas, if only there were an instrument that could do that.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt; Independently, I like the sound of the same letters you&apos;re using tuned<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt; as matching a harmonic series, which is then ending at 17, but I agree<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt; and admit that is not the same chord exactly.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; Yeah. they&apos;re just different chords.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt; You missed my analogy about the circle of fifths. You don&apos;t have to<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt; go 36 fifths OUT, as you say. If you simply do standard jazz<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt; circle-of-fifths progressions without compromise (meaning JI) than<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt; each time around the circle you will go flat a comma. Don&apos;t tell me<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt; you&apos;ve never used such progressions. My point is you are used to<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt; doing that in 12ET and not complaining, even though doing that 3 times<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt; (pay attention, I&apos;m not saying it is one big chord, I&apos;m talking about<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt; over time) but you calculated the JI ratios over time in relation to<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt; the starting note, you would end up a half-step flat. The point is<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt; that 12ET DOES TRULY FAIL to recreate the effect of JI series of<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt; fifths that goes flat and if you want a series like that to go flat,<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt; don&apos;t use 12ET. 72ET also has its own properties. These TYPES of<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt; issues are possible in any temperament, but each temperament has its<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt; own peculiar issues. 205ET does not have a rounding issue in the<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt; example we&apos;ve discussed, but it does in other contexts I&apos;m sure, but<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt; with simply more notes, such errors are fewer.

The Plexus keyboard was<br/>&gt; designed to have transpositional invariance for a multiplicity of<br/>&gt; tunings.  Any keyboard that will do that is very definitely<br/>&gt; generalized.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Not all &quot;keys&quot; (or &quot;buttons&quot;) have the same feel, but that&apos;s a form<br/>&gt; of touch-coding (which is good!).<br/>&gt;</p><p>This was clarified off-list... I now understand the question.<br/>Generalized as a work means not highly adapted to a specific function<br/>or use or whatever.  And the TPX is able to be modified toward any<br/>tuning, but the keys and shapes and colors are blatantly biased toward<br/>the master tuning which is designed around near-pythagorean extended<br/>sorta thing.  It really is biased that way.  It is possible but not<br/>ideal to relate other tunings.  For one thing, the pure number of keys<br/>makes reasonable layouts of smaller temperaments have duplicate keys,<br/>and sometimes in hard to follow ways.  It functions, but it is not<br/>generalized in the sense of being open to various layouts.  It is<br/>biased toward a particular layout.</p><p>Still, it isn&apos;t a totally specific, set keyboard either - so it has<br/>lots of properties that could be considered generalized.</p><p>&gt; &gt; That<br/>&gt; &gt; is good for what it is, but bad for anyone wanting a generalized<br/>&gt; one.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; By &quot;generalized&quot;, did you mean a *Bosanquet* generalized layout?  If<br/>&gt; that&apos;s the case, then you still need to observe that the Plexus<br/>&gt; regions (considered as logical &quot;keys&quot; encompassing 5 buttons each)<br/>&gt; are arranged in a Bosanquet layout), which is not at all bad for<br/>&gt; anyone wanting a generalized keyboard.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I&apos;ve been in touch with Aaron Hunt off-list and have already given<br/>&gt; him a couple of suggestions for (1/3-comma &amp; 1/4-comma) adaptive<br/>&gt; tunings.  I have a few other ideas brewing, as well, one of which is<br/>&gt; an adaptive 9-limit temperament (with 1/4-cent max. error).  (Another<br/>&gt; is a way to implement 34-tone and/or 56-tone pajara on the Plexus,<br/>&gt; and also 46-EDO.)<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; If the 2.9-cent 9-limit error of 205-EDO is too much for you, then<br/>&gt; you can always cut that to 1.9-cent error by putting in 217-EDO (of<br/>&gt; which it&apos;s possible to get all of the tones, I believe).<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; You&apos;ll find that there are all sorts of possibilities with the<br/>&gt; Plexus, if you&apos;re willing to let your imagination run wild. ;-)<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; --George<br/>&gt;</p><p>Thanks for the thoughts George.  I am decently happy with the 205, and<br/>mainly I want adaptive within that to eliminate errors.  In other<br/>words, I don&apos;t care about more complex things.  I like the idea of<br/>just-noticeable-difference being the interval precision.  I just want<br/>to also access beatless harmonies for their own aesthetic value.  So<br/>if Aaron Hunt goes ahead with the adaptive-205 function around the TPX<br/>master tuning, I&apos;ll be SET.  The only things I want besides that are<br/>velocity sensitivity and some way to very controllably and<br/>expressively control wide gliding portamento sorts of sounds, and both<br/>of those are kind of fantasy-level not very realistic requests.</p><p>Best,<br/>Aaron Wolf</p></div><h3><a id=76740 href="#76740">ðŸ”—</a>Mike Battaglia &#x3C;battaglia01@...&#x3E;</h3><span>5/27/2008 8:03:10 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>That&apos;s actually exactly what I&apos;m trying to do.

That&apos;s all I&apos;m saying.<br/>&gt;&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; If you are composing with retunable, adjustable stuff on the computer<br/>&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; - then you have no reason to settle for temperament if the sound you<br/>&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; want is pure JI. In other words, if you&apos;re willing to adjust a piece<br/>&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; note-by-note you can have pure extended JI (to a decent precision<br/>&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; anyway). No reason to compromise and temper unless you want the<br/>&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; vagueness and comma-elimination of a temperament.<br/>&gt;&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt;&gt; &gt; Well, I don&apos;t want to be stuck to the computer. That&apos;s just the point.<br/>&gt;&gt; &gt; I think in JI, but I&apos;m looking for a temperament in which my JI<br/>&gt;&gt; &gt; thoughts translate to the temperament efficiently. 12-tet is good for<br/>&gt;&gt; &gt; that, but I can&apos;t get at all of the chords that I want. 19-tet I find<br/>&gt;&gt; &gt; to be a marginal improvement, and in some ways is worse than 12-tet.<br/>&gt;&gt; &gt; 31-tet is also pretty good, but I find the meantone fifths a little<br/>&gt;&gt; &gt; bit harsh sometimes. 53-tet is amazing for 5-limit stuff, but isn&apos;t as<br/>&gt;&gt; &gt; good for 7-limit stuff. 41-tet is decent. 72-tet seemed like the<br/>&gt;&gt; &gt; greatest invention on the face of the planet until I realized that we<br/>&gt;&gt; &gt; now have so many divisions that the accumulated error needed for<br/>&gt;&gt; &gt; rounding errors to occur is extremely small.<br/>&gt;&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; If I wanted your chord, aside from using my TPX, I&apos;d actually choose<br/>&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; to tune it as pure JI, and I&apos;d just leave it that way and never temper<br/>&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; at all.<br/>&gt;&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt;&gt; &gt; Alas, if only there were an instrument that could do that.<br/>&gt;&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; Independently, I like the sound of the same letters you&apos;re using tuned<br/>&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; as matching a harmonic series, which is then ending at 17, but I agree<br/>&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; and admit that is not the same chord exactly.<br/>&gt;&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt;&gt; &gt; Yeah. they&apos;re just different chords.<br/>&gt;&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; You missed my analogy about the circle of fifths. You don&apos;t have to<br/>&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; go 36 fifths OUT, as you say. If you simply do standard jazz<br/>&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; circle-of-fifths progressions without compromise (meaning JI) than<br/>&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; each time around the circle you will go flat a comma. Don&apos;t tell me<br/>&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; you&apos;ve never used such progressions. My point is you are used to<br/>&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; doing that in 12ET and not complaining, even though doing that 3 times<br/>&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; (pay attention, I&apos;m not saying it is one big chord, I&apos;m talking about<br/>&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; over time) but you calculated the JI ratios over time in relation to<br/>&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; the starting note, you would end up a half-step flat. The point is<br/>&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; that 12ET DOES TRULY FAIL to recreate the effect of JI series of<br/>&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; fifths that goes flat and if you want a series like that to go flat,<br/>&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; don&apos;t use 12ET. 72ET also has its own properties. These TYPES of<br/>&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; issues are possible in any temperament, but each temperament has its<br/>&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; own peculiar issues. 205ET does not have a rounding issue in the<br/>&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; example we&apos;ve discussed, but it does in other contexts I&apos;m sure, but<br/>&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; with simply more notes, such errors are fewer. In other words, 205ET<br/>&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; is overall more similar to pure JI than 72ET, although it isn&apos;t<br/>&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; particularly noticeable in many contexts.<br/>&gt;&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt;&gt; &gt; Yeah. That would be the reason why I&apos;m looking to branch away from<br/>&gt;&gt; &gt; 12-tet :P And as I continue to search for a new temperament, I find<br/>&gt;&gt; &gt; that 72-tet has its own drawbacks, as you are saying. But accumulated<br/>&gt;&gt; &gt; rounding errors manifest themselves when working exclusively within<br/>&gt;&gt; &gt; 72-tet as dissonance that builds up over time, so that people think<br/>&gt;&gt; &gt; that chords like the #15 &quot;just don&apos;t sound good,&quot; when really it&apos;s<br/>&gt;&gt; &gt; just that this stupid rounding issue has occured again. My main<br/>&gt;&gt; &gt; problem with 72-tet is that I&apos;m trying to find an easy-to-understand<br/>&gt;&gt; &gt; microtonal system for people that don&apos;t know anything about just<br/>&gt;&gt; &gt; intonation or want to do any kind of math. I want to give people some<br/>&gt;&gt; &gt; temperament to work in that can let them hit higher limit chords, and<br/>&gt;&gt; &gt; although 72-tet seems like the obvious choice as it just comes out of<br/>&gt;&gt; &gt; 12-tet, they are eventually going to run into this rounding issue as<br/>&gt;&gt; &gt; well, and I don&apos;t want to have to teach them JI theory and have them<br/>&gt;&gt; &gt; think about rounding errors, because if they have to do that then this<br/>&gt;&gt; &gt; system won&apos;t ever catch on. One option is to proceed and just ignore<br/>&gt;&gt; &gt; the existence of these rounding errors, and assume that the slight out<br/>&gt;&gt; &gt; of tune-ness will most likely not make a perceptible difference<br/>&gt;&gt; &gt; especially when everyone&apos;s used to 12-tet -- another is to find<br/>&gt;&gt; &gt; another equal temperament that doesn&apos;t have these particular issues.<br/>&gt;&gt; &gt; I&apos;m still looking for that holy grail, but if it doesn&apos;t exist then<br/>&gt;&gt; &gt; I&apos;ll stick with 72-tet -- 53-tet has its own issues, and I never liked<br/>&gt;&gt; &gt; 41-tet all of that much, though if I had a midi controller that I<br/>&gt;&gt; &gt; could retune to see what these sounded like live... :P<br/>&gt;&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; See the real question is something you haven&apos;t answered yet:<br/>&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; Do you hear a substantial difference between your preffered version of<br/>&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; the chord in 72ET and the pure JI version?<br/>&gt;&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt;&gt; &gt; Yes. the 72-tet one doesn&apos;t sound as good, noticeably. Other chords in<br/>&gt;&gt; &gt; JI manifest themselves in 72-tet as a slight warbling that I don&apos;t<br/>&gt;&gt; &gt; really mind at all. This chord, however, has a much different feel to<br/>&gt;&gt; &gt; it in 72-tet -- the top note is halfway between 72-tet steps.<br/>&gt;&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; If you do hear a difference, then you are quite right to say that 72ET<br/>&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; isn&apos;t achieving something you want. I do notice a difference and I<br/>&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; like the JI version myself.<br/>&gt;&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt;&gt; &gt; Hallelujah.<br/>&gt;&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; However, if they both essentially express the same thing to you and<br/>&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; you don&apos;t particularly care about getting the JI version, then it is<br/>&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; obvious that 72ET is functional for you and the error is only that you<br/>&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; insist on relating it to JI even though you yourself are finding no<br/>&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; musical value in doing that. JI is significant but it isn&apos;t the<br/>&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; absolute root of all music that everything must relate to directly.<br/>&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; It took me a long time to accept that myself.<br/>&gt;&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt;&gt; &gt; I think in JI. JI is what comes natural to me. I don&apos;t think in terms<br/>&gt;&gt; &gt; of numbers like 135, but I think of solid intervals that have their<br/>&gt;&gt; &gt; basis in a harmonic series. And then from THAT, I go onto other things<br/>&gt;&gt; &gt; like stretched harmonic intervals and sharpened leading tones and<br/>&gt;&gt; &gt; stuff generally in the vein of what you describe.<br/>&gt;&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt;&gt; &gt; There are times when I do think in terms of irrational numbers, such<br/>&gt;&gt; &gt; as the giant steps progression -- I never heard that as a series of<br/>&gt;&gt; &gt; chords that go down in 5/4 patterns, but rather as a series of chords<br/>&gt;&gt; &gt; that go down exactly one third of an octave.<br/>&gt;&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt;&gt; &gt; Before I get another onslaught of how it&apos;s useless to use temperament<br/>&gt;&gt; &gt; if I think in JI -- it isn&apos;t useless at all. I don&apos;t have any<br/>&gt;&gt; &gt; instrument with an unlimited range of pitches (although I have a few<br/>&gt;&gt; &gt; ideas for some), and so I have to use temperament. So I have to weigh<br/>&gt;&gt; &gt; the advantages and disadvantages of each temperament before deciding<br/>&gt;&gt; &gt; which one is the holy grail of Jesus or something. I don&apos;t mind errors<br/>&gt;&gt; &gt; in an equal temperament that deviate from actual JI values --<br/>&gt;&gt; &gt; obviously that is inherent in any equal temperament. But I find these<br/>&gt;&gt; &gt; rounding errors a little hard to swallow.<br/>&gt;&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt;&gt; &gt; Charles Lucy<br/>&gt;&gt; &gt; lucy@... &lt;mailto:lucy%<a href="http://40lucytune.com">40lucytune.com</a>&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt; &gt; - Promoting global harmony through LucyTuning -<br/>&gt;&gt; &gt; for information on LucyTuning go to:<br/>&gt;&gt; &gt; <a href="http://www.lucytune.com">http://www.lucytune.com</a> &lt;<a href="http://www.lucytune.com">http://www.lucytune.com</a>&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt; &gt; For LucyTuned Lullabies go to:<br/>&gt;&gt; &gt; <a href="http://www.lullabies.co.uk">http://www.lullabies.co.uk</a> &lt;<a href="http://www.lullabies.co.uk">http://www.lullabies.co.uk</a>&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt;&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt;&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;</p></div><h3><a id=76741 href="#76741">ðŸ”—</a>Aaron Wolf &#x3C;aaron@...&#x3E;</h3><span>5/27/2008 8:06:40 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;Mike Battaglia&quot; &lt;battaglia01@...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt; I wouldn&apos;t be thinking in numbers like 135, but I would be<br/>thinking in<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt; terms of intervals like the perfect fifth and major third and<br/>septimal<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt; subminor third and such, and if I try to stack enough of these<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt; intervals on top of each other, they start to sound incredibly warbly<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt; and dissonant unless I go back to scala (which I don&apos;t like to<br/>do) and<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt; figure out the JI equivalent, then find where there is a &quot;rounding<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt; error,&quot; and then play THAT chord where the rounding errors are fixed,<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt; and then suddenly it sounds much better.

What context is<br/>&gt; &gt; it that you are stacking these chords? They start to sound warbly? I<br/>&gt; &gt; am having a hard time imagining what you are doing.

What situation are you<br/>&gt; &gt; in where you are getting this and then going &quot;back to scala&quot; from?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I usually mess around in Cakewalk Sonar by setting up 6 MIDI channels<br/>&gt; tuned a 12th-tone apart to get 72tet. Then I can run those channels<br/>&gt; through EastWest or VSL or some other sample library to hear what an<br/>&gt; orchestra would sound like playing them -- in my experience, the only<br/>&gt; instrument in which microtonal music takes a lot of getting used to is<br/>&gt; piano, as we are SO used to the notes being immovable and firm in<br/>&gt; 12tet. It isn&apos;t quite the eloquent solution, but it&apos;s all I&apos;ve got.<br/>&gt;</p><p>Ok, thanks.  That clarifies things.

The Tonal Plexus is for<br/>&gt; &gt; you! I&apos;m telling you - it is entirely based around relating things<br/>&gt; &gt; back to normal 12ET while accessing near-JI for most anything. It is<br/>&gt; &gt; so visually clear what is going on. I spent years struggling to<br/>&gt; &gt; explain theoretical concepts that I have now shown people in less than<br/>&gt; &gt; 10 minutes on the TPX, and it isn&apos;t just that they hear it - it<br/>&gt; &gt; visually is clear and makes sense and they can relate it to the little<br/>&gt; &gt; music theory they learned traditionally. I really think it is the<br/>&gt; &gt; answer for you at this time.

I NEVER<br/>&gt; EVER said I prefer the 149 bad major third at the top. When I said to<br/>&gt; ignore the rounding error - I mean ignore that entire approach and<br/>&gt; ignore being frustrated by it and just use the GOOD chord - the one<br/>&gt; that Carl said is obvious, because it IS more obvious than the other.</p><p>I just reread this whole thread, and here is the source of the<br/>miscommunication. By stacking 3rds on top of each other, you arrive at<br/>149. By adjusting for rounding errors, you arrive at 150. It seems<br/>like you have the concept flipped -- 149 is the third you would<br/>expect, but 150 is what you get if you approximate 135/32 directly. It<br/>seems like you&apos;re saying that 150 is the third you&apos;d expect, and 149<br/>approximates the rounding errors. But actually the rounding errors<br/>make the third round SHARP, and so it jumps UP to 150.</p><p>BUT, I find that the 150 does sound in fact a little better, although<br/>after going back and looking at it it might be because that 150 also<br/>doubles as an approximation of 17/4, as has been suggested.</p><p>The important thing to note here is that 17/4 is irrelevant, because<br/>this chord is just ONE chord that has this problem. Let&apos;s say, for<br/>example, that I want to play a minor 11 chord from the b9 scale<br/>degree? that is, from C, I want to play a Bb minor 9 chord? Or, I want<br/>to play a sus9 chord from the b3 scale degree? All of these chords<br/>sound best by just &quot;going with the flow&quot; of the temperament as you<br/>suggest, but it is extremely common to build complex polychords by<br/>playing these chords while the root is still held, or while a chord<br/>built from the root is still held, or something to that effect. I much<br/>like the feel of these chords, but some of them in 72-tet sound<br/>&quot;warbly&quot; for no apparent reason, and the reason I have found is this<br/>phenomenon of accumulated rounding errors. Going back and fixing them<br/>manually usually makes them closer to the JI versions and thus they<br/>sound more beatless and in tune and pure. But these rounding errors<br/>that do occur really leave us with three options:</p><p>1. Ignore them and just play the constituent intervals as they appear<br/>in the temperament, or<br/>2. Try to manually adjust for them, or<br/>3. Use alternate intervals that have their basis in a harmonic series</p><p>I think you are suggesting option 1. The thing is that there are<br/>certain instances and chords where I think that ignoring the rounding<br/>errors makes the chords sound -BAD-, as in with warbly beats and such.<br/>They&apos;re still better than 12tet, but not as good as 53, I find. So my<br/>other option is to adjust for them, which sounds good, but who wants<br/>to have to think about THAT while playing? So it&apos;s lose-lose.</p><p>And as for option 3, sometimes it works, and sometimes it&apos;s just a<br/>different chord. A dominant 7 chord with the 7th as 7/4 is different<br/>than a dominant 7 chord with the 7th at 16/9 is different from 9/5.</p><p>After hearing everyone&apos;s opinion on this, I think that it might not be<br/>as bad as I had first thought -- the little bit of warbliness<br/>introduced by these rounding errors is still certainly better than<br/>12tet -- but still, if there is another equal temperament that doesn&apos;t<br/>have these issues, that would be a plus. 53tet doesn&apos;t, but I find its<br/>7 and 11 limit stuff to be pretty bad. And I have always thought that<br/>41tet had a quality to it that was a little hard to swallow -- might<br/>be the flat major thirds, I can&apos;t tell what it is. But something about<br/>it is weird - I think 31tet sounds more &quot;in tune&quot; as a whole, except<br/>for the fifths.</p><p>And so the hunt for the holy grail of ET&apos;s continues in my mind.</p><p>-Mike</p></div><h3><a id=76752 href="#76752">ðŸ”—</a>Graham Breed &#x3C;gbreed@...&#x3E;</h3><span>5/28/2008 5:08:46 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>One thing I forgot to mention.

By stacking 3rds on top of each other, you arrive at<br/>&gt; 149. By adjusting for rounding errors, you arrive at 150. It seems<br/>&gt; like you have the concept flipped -- 149 is the third you would<br/>&gt; expect, but 150 is what you get if you approximate 135/32 directly. It<br/>&gt; seems like you&apos;re saying that 150 is the third you&apos;d expect, and 149<br/>&gt; approximates the rounding errors. But actually the rounding errors<br/>&gt; make the third round SHARP, and so it jumps UP to 150.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; BUT, I find that the 150 does sound in fact a little better, although<br/>&gt; after going back and looking at it it might be because that 150 also<br/>&gt; doubles as an approximation of 17/4, as has been suggested.<br/>&gt;</p><p>OK!  I see?  Are you starting at zero or at one in your number, by the<br/>way?</p><p>And anyway, the point really is that *if* you want the chord that<br/>gives the feeling of being stacked thirds, then the one that sounds<br/>most like that is the one in which each third is as good as it can be.<br/> However, the best version of that is still definitely the JI version,<br/>and that&apos;s the one I prefer.  But that&apos;s for that intended chord.  The<br/>preference I have for making an alteration of the 12ET version of<br/>these notes is for it to be 4:5:6:7:9:11:13:17, or maybe<br/>8:10:12:14:18:27:34 (which is the same thing except a shift of 26/27.<br/> Those are my favorite versions of this chord, so I don&apos;t really<br/>prefer your version at all.  But *if* I want that stacked-thirds sound<br/>(though I rarely would in a case like this) - I&apos;d tune it to the 149<br/>the way you&apos;re numbering it and the way I NOW finally understand what<br/>you mean.</p><p>Another thought is that as absolute pitch range changes, cent offset<br/>matters.  The exact warble of the 72ET third is pretty noticeable<br/>actually.  I don&apos;t think the 72ET third is good enough for me in many<br/>ranges and timbres... I like JI or really near-JI.</p><p>As timbre changes, these things change as well.<br/>I am pretty darn sure you could find a timbre that dramatically<br/>diminishes the warble in this case and allows you to be more<br/>comfortable with the 149.  And I bet you could find a timbre that<br/>makes both chords awful when compared to my JI one.  Timbre really<br/>does matter.  Read Bill Sethares&apos; book.</p><p>Anyway, 72-ET has audbile beats both for the 400 cent third and the<br/>flatter third, so nothing in 72 can ever get you pure JI no-warble.<br/>Not even harmonic chords.</p><p>After all this is said and done, I&apos;d say that we probably are hearing<br/>the chords the same way.  We both like less &quot;warble&quot; generally.  And<br/>I&apos;d go so far as to say the problem isn&apos;t rounding errors, the problem<br/>is that you are going about the chords the wrong way and that you<br/>actually by ear don&apos;t even like the stacked thirds chord.  I bet that<br/>if you hear the JI version of stacked thirds, versus the JI version of<br/>my harmonic options, you&apos;d generally prefer the same harmonic chords<br/>that I prefer.  You are wanting to fit these into your stacking<br/>theory, but in fact your ear prefers solid harmony.  That&apos;s my guess.</p><p>Sorry for the confusion, it was mainly on my end but who cares about<br/>blame...</p><p>&gt; The important thing to note here is that 17/4 is irrelevant, because<br/>&gt; this chord is just ONE chord that has this problem. Let&apos;s say, for<br/>&gt; example, that I want to play a minor 11 chord from the b9 scale<br/>&gt; degree? that is, from C, I want to play a Bb minor 9 chord? Or, I want<br/>&gt; to play a sus9 chord from the b3 scale degree? All of these chords<br/>&gt; sound best by just &quot;going with the flow&quot; of the temperament as you<br/>&gt; suggest, but it is extremely common to build complex polychords by<br/>&gt; playing these chords while the root is still held, or while a chord<br/>&gt; built from the root is still held, or something to that effect. I much<br/>&gt; like the feel of these chords, but some of them in 72-tet sound<br/>&gt; &quot;warbly&quot; for no apparent reason, and the reason I have found is this<br/>&gt; phenomenon of accumulated rounding errors. Going back and fixing them<br/>&gt; manually usually makes them closer to the JI versions and thus they<br/>&gt; sound more beatless and in tune and pure. But these rounding errors<br/>&gt; that do occur really leave us with three options:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; 1. Ignore them and just play the constituent intervals as they appear<br/>&gt; in the temperament, or<br/>&gt; 2. Try to manually adjust for them, or<br/>&gt; 3. Use alternate intervals that have their basis in a harmonic series<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I think you are suggesting option 1. The thing is that there are<br/>&gt; certain instances and chords where I think that ignoring the rounding<br/>&gt; errors makes the chords sound -BAD-, as in with warbly beats and such.<br/>&gt; They&apos;re still better than 12tet, but not as good as 53, I find. So my<br/>&gt; other option is to adjust for them, which sounds good, but who wants<br/>&gt; to have to think about THAT while playing? So it&apos;s lose-lose.<br/>&gt;</p><p>No - I don&apos;t suggest option 1, option 1 is simply the best for the<br/>stacking/lattice theory that YOU want to insist on imposing on the<br/>harmony.<br/>I choose option 3, and I think it clearly sounds WAY better.  And<br/>option 3 also eliminates ALL of your issues because all other chordal<br/>examples are also not subject to rounding errors, only to general<br/>accuracy of the temperament.</p><p>&gt; And as for option 3, sometimes it works, and sometimes it&apos;s just a<br/>&gt; different chord. A dominant 7 chord with the 7th as 7/4 is different<br/>&gt; than a dominant 7 chord with the 7th at 16/9 is different from 9/5.<br/>&gt;</p><p>Very true, but you can only take this so far.  9/5 is still related<br/>reasonably to the root as well as to the fifth.  And it isn&apos;t horribly<br/>dissonant with the third even.  I like both those chords, though for<br/>most consonance, clearly I&apos;d go with the 7/4, but there are places for<br/>each.  But if you start extending further than maybe one or two more<br/>thirds beyond that it breaks down.  What I mean is you get notes in<br/>the chord that are harmonically unrelated enough that the unity of the<br/>chord is really not possible.  Some sense of stacked intervals is<br/>possible, but it does not compare to the effect of a stable chord.<br/>The stacking only works very well when it is short enough to still be<br/>actually very harmonically related.</p><p>I think that if you sustain a large stacked chord for a long time the<br/>primary listener experience is one of mild dissonance with some<br/>aspects of familiar harmony popping out in places.  I think if it goes<br/>by quicker, it is heard more as voice-leading.  Only a harmonic chord<br/>will be experienced as a stable consonance.  Stacking fifths on the<br/>other hand can be so spread out that it is not so dissonant, but in<br/>the same regard, you can stack &quot;14ths&quot; - meaning octave+maj7 with<br/>nothing in between and get relative stability with only mild<br/>dissonance because of the simple distance.</p><p>&gt; After hearing everyone&apos;s opinion on this, I think that it might not be<br/>&gt; as bad as I had first thought -- the little bit of warbliness<br/>&gt; introduced by these rounding errors is still certainly better than<br/>&gt; 12tet -- but still, if there is another equal temperament that doesn&apos;t<br/>&gt; have these issues, that would be a plus. 53tet doesn&apos;t, but I find its<br/>&gt; 7 and 11 limit stuff to be pretty bad. And I have always thought that<br/>&gt; 41tet had a quality to it that was a little hard to swallow -- might<br/>&gt; be the flat major thirds, I can&apos;t tell what it is. But something about<br/>&gt; it is weird - I think 31tet sounds more &quot;in tune&quot; as a whole, except<br/>&gt; for the fifths.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; And so the hunt for the holy grail of ET&apos;s continues in my mind.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; -Mike<br/>&gt;</p><p>Good luck in your journey.  Sorry for the confusion.  205ET had no<br/>rounding errors in any of the cases brought up, so that may have made<br/>it harder for me to relate to your issues...

Some contexts, scales<br/>are just arbitrary set pitches of hard-to-adjust acoustic instruments.<br/> Some contexts, scales are designed around the voice leading.<br/>Sometimes they come into being purely out of intellectual theory and<br/>then are gotten used to as we play them a lot.  Often it is a mix of<br/>all these factors and the same scale actually is used in different<br/>ways in different pieces.</p><p>Regards,<br/>Aaron Wolf</p></div><h3><a id=76765 href="#76765">ðŸ”—</a>George D.

By stacking 3rds on top of each other, you arrive at<br/>&gt;&gt; 149. By adjusting for rounding errors, you arrive at 150. It seems<br/>&gt;&gt; like you have the concept flipped -- 149 is the third you would<br/>&gt;&gt; expect, but 150 is what you get if you approximate 135/32 directly. It<br/>&gt;&gt; seems like you&apos;re saying that 150 is the third you&apos;d expect, and 149<br/>&gt;&gt; approximates the rounding errors. But actually the rounding errors<br/>&gt;&gt; make the third round SHARP, and so it jumps UP to 150.<br/>&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt; BUT, I find that the 150 does sound in fact a little better, although<br/>&gt;&gt; after going back and looking at it it might be because that 150 also<br/>&gt;&gt; doubles as an approximation of 17/4, as has been suggested.<br/>&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; OK! I see? Are you starting at zero or at one in your number, by the<br/>&gt; way?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; And anyway, the point really is that *if* you want the chord that<br/>&gt; gives the feeling of being stacked thirds, then the one that sounds<br/>&gt; most like that is the one in which each third is as good as it can be.<br/>&gt; However, the best version of that is still definitely the JI version,<br/>&gt; and that&apos;s the one I prefer. But that&apos;s for that intended chord. The<br/>&gt; preference I have for making an alteration of the 12ET version of<br/>&gt; these notes is for it to be 4:5:6:7:9:11:13:17, or maybe<br/>&gt; 8:10:12:14:18:27:34 (which is the same thing except a shift of 26/27.<br/>&gt; Those are my favorite versions of this chord, so I don&apos;t really<br/>&gt; prefer your version at all. But *if* I want that stacked-thirds sound<br/>&gt; (though I rarely would in a case like this) - I&apos;d tune it to the 149<br/>&gt; the way you&apos;re numbering it and the way I NOW finally understand what<br/>&gt; you mean.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Another thought is that as absolute pitch range changes, cent offset<br/>&gt; matters. The exact warble of the 72ET third is pretty noticeable<br/>&gt; actually. I don&apos;t think the 72ET third is good enough for me in many<br/>&gt; ranges and timbres... I like JI or really near-JI.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; As timbre changes, these things change as well.<br/>&gt; I am pretty darn sure you could find a timbre that dramatically<br/>&gt; diminishes the warble in this case and allows you to be more<br/>&gt; comfortable with the 149. And I bet you could find a timbre that<br/>&gt; makes both chords awful when compared to my JI one. Timbre really<br/>&gt; does matter. Read Bill Sethares&apos; book.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Anyway, 72-ET has audbile beats both for the 400 cent third and the<br/>&gt; flatter third, so nothing in 72 can ever get you pure JI no-warble.<br/>&gt; Not even harmonic chords.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; After all this is said and done, I&apos;d say that we probably are hearing<br/>&gt; the chords the same way. We both like less &quot;warble&quot; generally. And<br/>&gt; I&apos;d go so far as to say the problem isn&apos;t rounding errors, the problem<br/>&gt; is that you are going about the chords the wrong way and that you<br/>&gt; actually by ear don&apos;t even like the stacked thirds chord. I bet that<br/>&gt; if you hear the JI version of stacked thirds, versus the JI version of<br/>&gt; my harmonic options, you&apos;d generally prefer the same harmonic chords<br/>&gt; that I prefer. You are wanting to fit these into your stacking<br/>&gt; theory, but in fact your ear prefers solid harmony. That&apos;s my guess.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Sorry for the confusion, it was mainly on my end but who cares about<br/>&gt; blame...<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt; The important thing to note here is that 17/4 is irrelevant, because<br/>&gt;&gt; this chord is just ONE chord that has this problem. Let&apos;s say, for<br/>&gt;&gt; example, that I want to play a minor 11 chord from the b9 scale<br/>&gt;&gt; degree? that is, from C, I want to play a Bb minor 9 chord? Or, I want<br/>&gt;&gt; to play a sus9 chord from the b3 scale degree? All of these chords<br/>&gt;&gt; sound best by just &quot;going with the flow&quot; of the temperament as you<br/>&gt;&gt; suggest, but it is extremely common to build complex polychords by<br/>&gt;&gt; playing these chords while the root is still held, or while a chord<br/>&gt;&gt; built from the root is still held, or something to that effect. I much<br/>&gt;&gt; like the feel of these chords, but some of them in 72-tet sound<br/>&gt;&gt; &quot;warbly&quot; for no apparent reason, and the reason I have found is this<br/>&gt;&gt; phenomenon of accumulated rounding errors. Going back and fixing them<br/>&gt;&gt; manually usually makes them closer to the JI versions and thus they<br/>&gt;&gt; sound more beatless and in tune and pure. But these rounding errors<br/>&gt;&gt; that do occur really leave us with three options:<br/>&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt; 1. Ignore them and just play the constituent intervals as they appear<br/>&gt;&gt; in the temperament, or<br/>&gt;&gt; 2. Try to manually adjust for them, or<br/>&gt;&gt; 3. Use alternate intervals that have their basis in a harmonic series<br/>&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt; I think you are suggesting option 1. The thing is that there are<br/>&gt;&gt; certain instances and chords where I think that ignoring the rounding<br/>&gt;&gt; errors makes the chords sound -BAD-, as in with warbly beats and such.<br/>&gt;&gt; They&apos;re still better than 12tet, but not as good as 53, I find. So my<br/>&gt;&gt; other option is to adjust for them, which sounds good, but who wants<br/>&gt;&gt; to have to think about THAT while playing? So it&apos;s lose-lose.<br/>&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; No - I don&apos;t suggest option 1, option 1 is simply the best for the<br/>&gt; stacking/lattice theory that YOU want to insist on imposing on the<br/>&gt; harmony.<br/>&gt; I choose option 3, and I think it clearly sounds WAY better. And<br/>&gt; option 3 also eliminates ALL of your issues because all other chordal<br/>&gt; examples are also not subject to rounding errors, only to general<br/>&gt; accuracy of the temperament.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt; And as for option 3, sometimes it works, and sometimes it&apos;s just a<br/>&gt;&gt; different chord. A dominant 7 chord with the 7th as 7/4 is different<br/>&gt;&gt; than a dominant 7 chord with the 7th at 16/9 is different from 9/5.<br/>&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Very true, but you can only take this so far. 9/5 is still related<br/>&gt; reasonably to the root as well as to the fifth. And it isn&apos;t horribly<br/>&gt; dissonant with the third even. I like both those chords, though for<br/>&gt; most consonance, clearly I&apos;d go with the 7/4, but there are places for<br/>&gt; each. But if you start extending further than maybe one or two more<br/>&gt; thirds beyond that it breaks down. What I mean is you get notes in<br/>&gt; the chord that are harmonically unrelated enough that the unity of the<br/>&gt; chord is really not possible. Some sense of stacked intervals is<br/>&gt; possible, but it does not compare to the effect of a stable chord.<br/>&gt; The stacking only works very well when it is short enough to still be<br/>&gt; actually very harmonically related.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I think that if you sustain a large stacked chord for a long time the<br/>&gt; primary listener experience is one of mild dissonance with some<br/>&gt; aspects of familiar harmony popping out in places. I think if it goes<br/>&gt; by quicker, it is heard more as voice-leading. Only a harmonic chord<br/>&gt; will be experienced as a stable consonance. Stacking fifths on the<br/>&gt; other hand can be so spread out that it is not so dissonant, but in<br/>&gt; the same regard, you can stack &quot;14ths&quot; - meaning octave+maj7 with<br/>&gt; nothing in between and get relative stability with only mild<br/>&gt; dissonance because of the simple distance.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt; After hearing everyone&apos;s opinion on this, I think that it might not be<br/>&gt;&gt; as bad as I had first thought -- the little bit of warbliness<br/>&gt;&gt; introduced by these rounding errors is still certainly better than<br/>&gt;&gt; 12tet -- but still, if there is another equal temperament that doesn&apos;t<br/>&gt;&gt; have these issues, that would be a plus. 53tet doesn&apos;t, but I find its<br/>&gt;&gt; 7 and 11 limit stuff to be pretty bad. And I have always thought that<br/>&gt;&gt; 41tet had a quality to it that was a little hard to swallow -- might<br/>&gt;&gt; be the flat major thirds, I can&apos;t tell what it is. But something about<br/>&gt;&gt; it is weird - I think 31tet sounds more &quot;in tune&quot; as a whole, except<br/>&gt;&gt; for the fifths.<br/>&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt; And so the hunt for the holy grail of ET&apos;s continues in my mind.<br/>&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt; -Mike<br/>&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Good luck in your journey.

But then I noticed it descends in pitch<br/>as we go up each column.  And then I noticed it has fewer columns per<br/>octave.  I don&apos;t doubt that it probably makes sense once one gets used<br/>to it, but there&apos;s no chance I could present that to traditionally<br/>knowledgeable musicians and have them make sense of it - let alone the<br/>same issue for myself.</p><p>The Hunt layout is fantastic.  I can use it to immediately and<br/>visually explain to a guitar student exactly why and how to bend a<br/>note a certain way for certain effect.  The Hunt layout allows access<br/>to a wide range of microtonality while being totally visually<br/>connected to the language and thinking of most people out there.  And<br/>I can easily play across the center and match up with normal 12ET<br/>musicians.</p><p>Anyway, the more I look at that layout, the more sense it makes.  For<br/>72, it is pretty reasonable.

I am working hard at testing myself and trying not be<br/>dogmatic and not to simply emotionally reinforce the decision I<br/>already made.  I definitely think 72ET has a place and is interesting.<br/> And I can get it (it comes default even) as an option on my TPX, but<br/>it doesn&apos;t make as much sense of the 205ET standard for that.  In the<br/>end, the TPX is really the only existing thing that works for what I<br/>want it for.  Otherwise, I&apos;m comfortable playing around with any<br/>controller, standard or otherwise and random tuning set-ups that I can<br/>do with software.

On the other hand, quarter tones as<br/>played on guitar always sounded pretty cool, because they were easy to<br/>integrate and &quot;grab&quot; mentally -- they were just bent versions of<br/>12-tet notes. On the other hand, if I screw around in 19-tet, there<br/>are a whole new set of modulations and substitute chords to go to, all<br/>of which are accessible via the circle of fifths, and some of them<br/>just sound like genuinely new chords and directions to move into.

The thing is that I have no<br/>microtonal instruments to play on, but I can &quot;map&quot; 19tet on my<br/>computer keyboard, which I can&apos;t do with 31tet, as there aren&apos;t enough<br/>keys. Someday I&apos;ll get my microtonal controller...</p><p>My current plan is actually to build a Halberstadt split-key 19-tet<br/>keyboard out of legos and then use a basic stamp or an intel 8085 (I<br/>think) microcontroller to implement it as a MIDI controller.<br/>Ironically, the problem I&apos;m having isn&apos;t how to make the electronics<br/>or the MIDI controller end of it, it&apos;s building the keys out of legos,<br/>because the lego piece dimensions aren&apos;t precise enough unless I make<br/>the keys huge.</p><p>But as for 31-tet, even that isn&apos;t really the greatest thing in the<br/>universe -- it has a pretty good range to a huge array of sounds, but<br/>I sometimes find the meantone fifths pretty hard to swallow. Minor 9<br/>chords, for instance, are pretty rough in 31-tet, as are major7#11<br/>chords or anything else requiring stacked thirds and fifths. I even in<br/>some ways prefer 19 to 31, because 19 at least allows you some kind of<br/>rough access to higher-limit sounds with a fairly economical number of<br/>keys. For the amount of notes that 31-tet requires, I figure you might<br/>as well go up to 41-tet and enjoy the better fifths.</p><p>&gt; First time I heard a quarter tone was in middle school marching band,<br/>&gt; but it was actually two clarinet players in unison.</p><p>Hahaha</p><p>&gt; I started playing piano at age four or five (it&apos;s a LOT easier to attain<br/>&gt; perfect pitch if you start at a very young age), so I was long &quot;fixed&quot;<br/>&gt; to 12-equal.

I started playing when I was 2. 24-equal always sounded<br/>&quot;weird&quot; to me. The best explanation for why that is I have now is<br/>simply that I&apos;ve never heard it &quot;pulled off&quot; right, but ever since I<br/>found 31-tet and such I don&apos;t really care about 24-equal anymore.<br/>53-tet seems like the greatest thing on the earth to me now, but of<br/>course I lack the means to really explore it like I want.

It goes from Dm to Gm/D, so it sets you<br/>up for Aeolian, and then it beats the hell out of you with the E#m.<br/>One of the more &quot;exotic&quot; microtonal works I&apos;ve heard. I presume the<br/>idea behind that E# is that it&apos;s equidistant between D and G.</p><p>Aaron Krister Johnson is one of my favorite microtonal composers btw<br/>-- check out this piece if you haven&apos;t already:<br/><a href="http://www.akjmusic.com/audio/melancholic.mp3">http://www.akjmusic.com/audio/melancholic.mp3</a><br/>It&apos;s done in 53-tet. I heard this years ago and I still play this<br/>piece to people when I&apos;m introducing microtonal music to them. It&apos;s<br/>pretty standard 5-limit, but every now and then a subminor chord or<br/>something comes in that&apos;s a little different. Amazing inspired piece.</p><p>Just as a side note, I notice that the microtonal compositions that<br/>are initially hardest to swallow are those that are either played on a<br/>piano or with a piano-like instrument, and those in which GM MIDI<br/>sounds are used. I think it&apos;s because we are least used to these<br/>sounds deviating from 12-tet in any way at all, unless you trick your<br/>brain into thinking that a 19-tet tuned piano is just &quot;out of tune,&quot;<br/>saloon style (seriously). I&apos;d love to get some of these works that we<br/>all love and run them through a high end sample library like VSL or<br/>EastWest or EWQLRA so that we can hear what they would sound like on<br/>instruments where we&apos;re used to subtle variations in pitch and sounds<br/>other than normal 12-tet. Like all of the orchestral instruments, for<br/>example.</p><p>&gt;&gt; Of course, 19tet isn&apos;t the be-all-end-all of everything, but I found<br/>&gt;&gt; that as someone with perfect pitch, it expanded my mind quite a bit.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; You&apos;ll soon learn that the be-all-end-all tuning is 72-TET. ;)<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Seriously, I do recommend 19-TET, along with 17 and 24, as &quot;entry-level&quot;<br/>&gt; tunings, along with &quot;macrotonal&quot; 5-, 7- and 10-TET. ~D.</p><p>Yeah, I just got in a discussion about this actually. 72-TET is<br/>awesome, except for these stupid rounding errors that occur if you<br/>stack up enough thirds and fifths and such. Check the<br/>&quot;Jazz-prime-limits-temperament&quot; thread if you&apos;re interested in all of<br/>that. I still think 72-tet might be incredibly useful, though.<br/>Although 53-tet is also some kind of amazing mathematical miracle for<br/>5-limit and some basic 7-limit music.</p><p>I&apos;ve also been going through the equal temperaments starting from 12<br/>and have hit upon some interesting ones that aren&apos;t often talked about<br/>-- 68tet, for example, has some remarkably pure sounds in it, and it<br/>extends 34-tet for people that are into that sound. There were a few<br/>random numbers that sounded good as well that I don&apos;t remember --<br/>might have been 66, or 58, or 56, or 48, or something.</p><p>As for the other tunings you mentioned, I always thought 17-tet<br/>sounded amazing from when I heard Easley Blackwood&apos;s 17-tet piece &quot;Con<br/>moto&quot; from his microtonal preludes cd way back in the day. The<br/>melodies sound incredibly vibrant, and for some reason he manages to<br/>make the major thirds sound not too bad, though I&apos;m not sure how.<br/>Though as for 24-tet, whenever I play people &quot;quarter-tone&quot; music it<br/>usually (to my ears) sounds incredibly dissonant. Usually in a &quot;cool&quot;<br/>way, but it doesn&apos;t usually express emotions, which is related I think<br/>to the fact that it doesn&apos;t express the huge range of consonances that<br/>exist beyond major thirds and fifths, except for the harmonic 11.<br/>Playing them some stuff in 5-tet usually catches their interest,<br/>however.</p><p>-Mike</p></div><h3><a id=76797 href="#76797">ðŸ”—</a>George D.
