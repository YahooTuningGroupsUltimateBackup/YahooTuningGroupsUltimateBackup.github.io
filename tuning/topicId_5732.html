I heard a few of his pieces on the radio<br/>and put him on the &quot;to buy&quot; list. When I looked<br/>at his CDs online I saw &quot;fretless ebow guitar&quot;<br/>as one of his instruments. For some reason it<br/>makes me think &quot;theremin&quot;, but I just have to<br/>hear what he does with it.</p><p>My recent forays into &quot;microtones&quot; on a guitar<br/>were to buy a bottleneck (but thats too much<br/>shedding) and working on half-bends to just<br/>intervals. The last actually matches with<br/>techniques that I use anyhow, and fingering<br/>dyads with just thirds, or hitting obvious<br/>overtone identitys (7/4, 11/8), doesn&apos;t require<br/>changing or giving up andything I already can do.</p><p>The next real step would be a new neck as discussed<br/>on this list (and Glen Peterson<br/>coming to this list has provided an invaluable<br/>resource). Maybe a 31tet baritone guitar...</p><p>Bob Valentine</p></div>
