Why is it, when we consider the audible frequency range from 20Hz to 20 KHz, we perceive a series of points along this scale that we can consider as having the same &quot;quality&quot; while patently being a different note? Part of the explanation may be that if we take a bi-lateral cross-section through the cochlea, that part of the ear&apos;s mechanism responsible for converting acoustic energy into electrical impulses, it reveals a spiral shape which can be described mathematically by a Fibonacci Series; the same maths govern the principles of the harmonic series. Neuro-pathology of the ear shows that octaves are decoded at the same point in each layer of the spiral. Some experts maintain that if the cochlea was a straight cone, rather than a tightly-wound spiral, we would have no perception of the octave at all; all we would hear would be a series of successively rising tones.</p></div><h3><a id=33177 href="#33177">ðŸ”—</a>paulerlich &#x3C;paul@stretch-music.com&#x3E;</h3><span>1/25/2002 10:25:01 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In tuning@y..., &quot;genewardsmith&quot; &lt;genewardsmith@j...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt; Here is something I found on<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; <a href="http://www.sweeney-todd.freeserve.co.uk/temper/no-frames/micro.htm">http://www.sweeney-todd.freeserve.co.uk/temper/no-frames/micro.htm</a><br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I&apos;d be interested to hear comments from Paul, et al, on this:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; An interesting consideration is the phenomenon of the octave.
