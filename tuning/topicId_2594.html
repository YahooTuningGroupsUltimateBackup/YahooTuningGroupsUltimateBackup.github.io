Where&apos;s<br/>the contradiction?</p><p>&gt;Compare the 15-tET major triad with one whose pitches are 0 395 720. Which<br/>&gt;one has lower RMS error? Which one has a close-enough-just-interval?</p><p>The one-just-interval observation is supposed to make small differences<br/>when the RMS is nearly the same.  It is not supposed to significantly<br/>change the RMS ranking.  In this case, a brief listening test found the<br/>15tET triad slightly better despite the slightly lower RMS of your chord.<br/>Do you disagree?</p><p>&gt;&gt;In particular, it may be better, when the RMS error is in a certain range,<br/>&gt;&gt;to keep one or more interval just and heap all the error onto the other(s)<br/>&gt;&gt;than to spread the error out.  I haven&apos;t had time to test this, but it<br/>&gt;&gt;could make sense -- the just interval(s) help lock down the periodicity of<br/>&gt;&gt;the chord.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;OK, but then you have no reason to stick to RMS error.</p><p>I like RMS for the same reasons you do.</p><p>&gt;Why is it that 6:5 can lock down the periodicity but 7:5 can&apos;t?</p><p>The 7:5 should be able to, but the power to lock should go down as the<br/>limit goes up.  I&apos;m also suggesting that the :4 intervals are more<br/>important.  I did say all 5-limit intervals could be weighted equally, but<br/>perhaps the 5:4 is slightly stronger than the 6:5, and perhaps 3:2 is<br/>stronger than either.  But I doubt these distinctions will make much<br/>difference until the 7-limit.</p><p>-C.</p></div>
