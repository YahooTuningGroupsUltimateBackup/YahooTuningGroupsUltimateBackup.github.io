Sound a low fundamental pitch and sing (hum) a major tenth above<br/>it (2:5) with a similar timber. Add a well-tuned fifth (2:3), preferably<br/>acoustically (your wife? roommate? hired singer?). Allow your major third<br/>tuning to float upward until it locks in a new place. The major triad<br/>changes from a mellow sound to a somewhat brighter sound, but no less<br/>&quot;locked&quot; (to my ear more locked) than the 4:5 third in this context. Let me<br/>know if it bites you. (You needn&apos;t be explicit about WHERE it bites you.<br/>LOL)<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; So far, I can&apos;t say I&apos;ve found anything.
