Such<br/>complex ratios for regular thirds and sixths are characteristic both<br/>of standard medieval Pythagorean intonation and of various neo-Gothic<br/>temperaments.[1]</p><p>Releasing their tension in directed cadential action, these complex<br/>intervals and sonorities (expansive quad 64:81:96:108; contractive<br/>quad 54:64:81:96) resolve quite efficiently by way of two-voice<br/>progressions involving motion by a usual 9:8 whole-tone in one voice<br/>and an incisive 256:243 semitone in the other (m3-1, M3-5, M6-8, M2-4,<br/>m7-5). These resolutions bring us to the pure &quot;valley&quot; sonority of a<br/>complete 2:3:4 trine or its prime interval of the 3:2 fifth.</p><p>A convenient measure of &quot;cadential efficiency&quot; is the total distance<br/>an unstable interval must expand or contract by stepwise contrary<br/>motion in order to reach stability. Here that distance is equal to the<br/>usual Pythagorean minor third of 32:27 or a rounded 294 cents -- one<br/>voice moving by a 204-cent whole-tone, the other by a 90-cent diatonic<br/>semitone.</p><p>In 7-flavor resolutions, we find that unstable sonorities as well as<br/>stable trines take on pure &quot;valley&quot; ratios, while at the same time<br/>resolutions become yet more efficient.

These resolutions (again m3-1, M3-5, M6-8, M2-4, m7-5)<br/>require a total expansion or contraction of only 267 cents, the size<br/>of our pure 7-flavor minor third at 7:6 (a 204-cent whole-tone plus a<br/>63-cent semitone) -- or, more precisely, ~266.87 cents.[2]</p><p>To explain this increase in both sensory consonance and cadential<br/>efficiency, we might note that 7-based intervals expanding to<br/>stability (M2, M3, M6) are a septimal comma (64:63, ~27.26 cents)<br/>_wider_ than their usual Pythagorean counterparts, while intervals<br/>contracting to stability (m3, m7) are a septimal comma _narrower_.<br/>Thus they can expand (M2-4, M3-5, M6-8) or contract (m3-1, m7-5) by a<br/>septimal comma less in order to attain their stable goal -- a total<br/>distance of 267 cents (7:6) rather than 294 cents (32:27).[3]</p><p>Each flavor has its own musical charm: the classic Pythagorean with<br/>its complex plateau intervals, and the streamlined 7-flavor with its<br/>pervasive valley intervals. Certain hybrid progressions may mix these<br/>flavors, often by way of striking septimal comma shifts (Section 4).</p><p>-----------------------------------------------------------<br/>2.2. Cadences and scales: the Archytas/al-Farabi connection<br/>-----------------------------------------------------------</p><p>Our pure 7-flavor cadences may be derived from tetrachords and octave<br/>scales of a kind described in Greek and Arabic theory, notably by<br/>Archytas of Tarentum (c. 428-350 BC) and Abu al-Nasr al-Farabi<br/>(870-950). These tetrachords and scales feature whole-tones<br/>alternating between ratios of 9:8 (~203.91 cents) and 8:7 (~231.17<br/>cents), and semitones of 28:27 (~62.96 cents).</p><p>The basic septimal tetrachord (i.e. four-note pattern) of Archytas<br/>divides the interval of a 4:3 fourth into these three steps, with some<br/>possible arrangements of whole-tones (T) and semitones (S) like these:</p><p>  S    T      T             T     T     S           T     S    T<br/>E   F     G      A       C     D      E   F      D      E   F     G<br/>28:27 9:8    8:7           9:8   8:7  28:27        8:7  28:27 9:8</p><p>These tetrachords have an appealing melodic and mathematical logic,<br/>with all steps derived from superparticular ratios or epimores fitting<br/>the pattern (n+1:n) -- 9:8, 8:7, 28:27.</p><p>As documented in the scales archives of Manuel op de Coul&apos;s Scala<br/>program, al-Farabi described an octave scale (identified in the file<br/>al-farabi_g3.scl as the &quot;Greek genus primum conjunctum&quot;) featuring<br/>these steps and tetrachords, which I here notate as an octave F-F:</p><p>  1:1     9:8     9:7   81:56 3:2  12:7   27:14 2:1<br/>  F3      G3      A3     B3   C4    D4     E4   F4<br/>   0      204     435    639  702   933   1137 1200<br/>      9:8     8:7     9:8  28:27 8:7   9:8  28:27<br/>      204     231     204   63   231   204   63</p><p>Using our 24-note keyboard notation, we can find this scale at the<br/>notes F3-G3-A^3-B^3-C4-D^4-E^4-F4, the carat (^) indicating notes on<br/>the upper manual a septimal comma above those of the lower manual.</p><p>In a neo-Gothic setting, we can generate a scale almost identical to<br/>al-Farabi&apos;s by beginning with two sonorities together forming a<br/>standard cadence: on our 24-note keyboard, the stable trine F3-C4-F4<br/>and the unstable 7-flavor expansive quad G3-B^3-D4-E^4. Adding the<br/>step A^3 to fit the pattern of adjacent whole-tones with alternating<br/>ratios of 9:8 and 8:7, we arrive at this scale in the octave F-F,<br/>which might be described in medieval European terms as a version of<br/>the Lydian mode or Mode V:</p><p>  1:1     9:8     9:7   81:56 3:2  27:16  27:14 2:1<br/>  F3      G3      A^3    B^3  C4    D4     E^4  F4<br/>   0      204     435    639  702   906   1137 1200<br/>      9:8     8:7     9:8  28:27 9:8   8:7  28:27<br/>      204     231     204   63   204   231   63</p><p>Here the only difference from al-Farabi&apos;s scale is the placement of D4<br/>at a 27:16 rather than a 12:7 above F3, with the upper tetrachord<br/>C4-D4-E^4-F4 arranged 9:8-8:7-28:27 rather than 8:7-9:8-28:27. This<br/>arrangement permits a pure fifth G3-D4 in the quad G3-B^3-D4-E^4,<br/>rather than G3-D^4, a septimal comma wide (32:21, ~729.22 cents).</p><p>More generally, taking the lowest note of any 2:3:4 trine as a local<br/>reference note &quot;1/1,&quot; we can define all steps but one of this variant<br/>on al-Farabi&apos;s scale from our trine (1/1-3/2-2/1) plus its 7-flavor<br/>expansive/intensive quad at 14:18:21:24 (9/8-81/56-27/16-27/14).</p><p>To demonstrate the musical use of the remaining third degree &quot;9/7,&quot; we<br/>consider cadences like the following involving an M2-5 resolution by<br/>near-conjunct contrary motion (stepwise motion in one voice, thirdwise<br/>motion in the other):</p><p> E^3  F4        E^4  F4<br/> B^3  C4        A^3  C4<br/> A^3  F3        G3   F3</p><p>  (M2-5)     (M6-8 + M2-5)</p><p>The first progression features the resolution of a mildly unstable<br/>&quot;quintal/quartal&quot; sonority (8:9:12), while the second involves a<br/>7-flavor form of expansive sixth sonority (7:8:12). All vertical<br/>fifths and fourths of these sonorities are pure, and all melodic<br/>semitones are a supercompact 28:27.</p><p>We can derive a similar octave scale from any 2:3:4 trine plus its<br/>7-flavor expansive/remissive quad, for example E^3-B^3-E^4 and<br/>F3-A^3-C4-D^4:</p><p> 1:1 28:27    7:6     4:3    3:2 14:9    16:9     2:1<br/> E^3  F3      G3      A^3    B^3  C4      D^4     E^4<br/>  0   63      267     498    702  765     996     1200<br/>  28:27   9:8     8:7    9:8   28:27  8:7     9:8<br/>   63     204     231    204    63    231     204</p><p>This scale might be described in medieval European terms as a 7-flavor<br/>version of the Phyrgian mode or Mode III (E-E). Again taking the<br/>lowest note of the stable trine as a local &quot;1/1,&quot; we now have a trine<br/>of (1/1-3/2-2/1) plus an expansive quad of (28/27-4/3-14/9-16/9) --<br/>sonorities with the desired ratios of 2:3:4 and 14:18:21:24.</p><p>Interestingly, if we add a third degree G3 or &quot;7/6&quot; so as to maintain<br/>the pattern of alternating 9:8 and 8:7 whole-tones, we arrive at a set<br/>of pitch classes identical to those of al-Farabi&apos;s scale -- enumerated<br/>in a range of F3-F4, F3-G3-A^3-B^3-C4-D^4-E^4-F4.</p><p>Placing the third degree at G3 facilitates a beautiful resolution of<br/>the mildly unstable F3-G3-C4 (8:9:12) combining melodic motions of a<br/>descending 28:27 semitone in the two outer voices (F3-E^3, C4-B^3)<br/>with an ascending 9:7 major third (G3-B^3) in the middle voice[4]:</p><p>  C4  B^3<br/>  G3  B^3<br/>  F3  E^3</p><p>  (M2-5)</p><p>Some other types of cadences, however, raise the complication of the<br/>impure fifths or fourths in these scales: A^3-D4 in our F-F scale, and<br/>G3-D^4 in our E^-E^ scale with pitch classes identical to al-Farabi&apos;s.<br/>A ready solution in our 24-note tuning is to vary the form of either<br/>note of such an interval (e.g. D4 or D^4, G3 or G^3) so as obtain pure<br/>vertical fifths and fourths[5]:</p><p> E^4  F4           D^4  E^4<br/> D^4  C4           G^3  B^3<br/> A^3  F3           F3   E^3</p><p> (M2-4)         (M6-8 + M2-5)</p><p>In the first cadence on F, a mildly unstable quintal/quartal sonority<br/>A^3-D^4-E^4 (6:8:9) resolves to the trine F3-C4-F4 with the unstable<br/>upper major second expanding to a fourth (M2-4); and the highest voice<br/>progresses by a 28:27 semitone (E^4-F4). Here D^4 is required in the<br/>middle voice for the pure fourth A^3-D^4 of the first sonority.</p><p>In the second cadence on E^, the sixth sonority F3-G^3-D^4 (7:8:12)<br/>resolves to E^3-B^3-E^4, the outer 12:7 major sixth F3-D^4 expanding<br/>to the octave E^3-E^4 with a descending 28:27 semitone F3-E^3 in the<br/>lowest voice. Here G^3 is needed in the middle voice for the pure<br/>fifth G^3-D^4 of the first sonority.</p><p>The pure 7-flavor progressions of neo-Gothic music thus have a certain<br/>affinity with these septimal tetrachords and scales of Archytas and<br/>al-Farabi, just as the 5-limit just intonation systems of the<br/>Renaissance have an affinity with the syntonic diatonic of Ptolemy.<br/>Common features include superparticular ratios for melodic steps,<br/>unequal whole-tones, and commatic distinctions between multiple<br/>versions of the same note (e.g. D4 and D^4 in the above examples).</p><p>Such a union of pure ratios and melodic patterns in complex polyphony<br/>is an art subtle and yet not impossible, at once intricate and<br/>beautiful.</p><p>--------------------------------------------------<br/>3. Adaptive structure: a comparison with Vicentino<br/>--------------------------------------------------</p><p>While realizing tetrachords and scales like those of Archytas and<br/>al-Farabi in a &quot;classic JI&quot; manner, our 24-note adaptive scheme also<br/>somewhat resembles the 38-note system of Vicentino for obtaining<br/>vertical concords with pure ratios. Here we focus on some similarities<br/>and differences between these two adaptive systems, from the viewpoint<br/>of the keyboard performer as well as the tuning theorist.</p><p>Vicentino&apos;s system for obtaining both &quot;perfect fifths&quot; and &quot;perfect<br/>thirds,&quot; as mentioned at the opening of Part I, involves two 19-note<br/>manuals evidently each tuned in 1/4-comma meantone (Gb-B#) with pure<br/>major thirds at a distance of 1/4 syntonic comma (~5.38 cents) apart.</p><p>A likely arrangement for the keyboards of Vicentino&apos;s _archicembalo_<br/>or _arciorgano_ is the following, with the usual five accidental keys<br/>of each manual split front-to-back (e.g. G#/Ab, Eb/D#), and extra<br/>small keys for E# and B#. Here Vicentino&apos;s comma sign (&apos;) -- for<br/>Vicentino, the term &quot;comma&quot; may refer to various small intervals --<br/>serves to show the raising of the notes on the second manual by 1/4<br/>syntonic comma:</p><p>   Db&apos;    D#&apos;         Gb&apos;    Ab&apos;    A#&apos;<br/>   C#&apos;    Eb&apos;   E#&apos;   F#&apos;    G#&apos;    Bb&apos;   B#&apos;<br/>C&apos;     D&apos;    E&apos;    F&apos;     G&apos;     A&apos;     B&apos;   C&apos;<br/>-----------------------------------------------<br/>   Db     D#          Gb     Ab     A#<br/>   C#     Eb    E#    F#     G#     Bb    B#<br/>C      D      E    F      G      A      B    C</p><p>Using this instrument, the player can attain pure ratios for complete<br/>5-limit sonorities of the 16th century extolled both by Vicentino and<br/>Gioseffo Zarlino (1558) as manifesting &quot;perfect&quot; harmony (Zarlino&apos;s<br/>_harmonia perfetta_).</p><p>Here are just realizations on Vicentino&apos;s keyboard for four forms of<br/>these complete sonorities regarded as concordant in practice and<br/>theory, and also two forms discussed by Zarlino[6] combining a sixth<br/>with a fourth above the lowest part, commonly subject to many of the<br/>same restrictions as more unequivocal discords. Interval arrangements<br/>for each sonority are shown by the notation (outer|lower + upper), and<br/>the just tuning is shown using Zarlino&apos;s string ratios, more modern<br/>frequency ratios, and rounded cents with respect to the lowest voice:</p><p>-----------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>   Example        Intervals    String ratio   Freq ratio      Cents<br/>-----------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>   C3-E3-G3&apos;     (5|M3 + m3)     15:12:10        4:5:6      0-386-702<br/>   D3-F3&apos;-A3&apos;    (5|m3 + M3)      6:5:4        10:12:15     0-316-702<br/>   E3-G3&apos;-C4     (m6|m3 + 4)     24:20:15        5:6:8      0-316-814<br/>   F3&apos;-A3&apos;-D4    (M6|M3 + 4)      5:4:3        12:15:20     0-386-884<br/>.......................................................................<br/>   G3&apos;-C4-E4     (M6|4 + M3)     20:15:12        3:4:5      0-498-884<br/>   A3&apos;-D4-F4&apos;    (m6|4 + m3)      8:6:5        15:20:24     0-498-814<br/>-----------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p>Pure major thirds and minor sixths are played with both notes on the<br/>same keyboard. Fifths and minor thirds, tempered narrow by Vicentino&apos;s<br/>&quot;comma&quot; of 5.38 cents on either keyboard, are restored to their just<br/>proportion by playing the lower note on the lower manual, and the<br/>upper note on the upper manual (e.g. D3-F3&apos;-A3&apos;). Fourths and major<br/>sixths, tempered wide by this same amount, are played in their just<br/>forms with the lower note on the upper keyboard and the upper note on<br/>the lower keyboard (e.g. F3&apos;-A3&apos;-D4).</p><p>As Vicentino&apos;s notation shows, narrow intervals are thus enlarged by<br/>this &quot;comma,&quot; and wide intervals reduced by it, achieving pure ratios.<br/>In his circular of 1561 advertising the arciorgano, this &quot;perfect<br/>diatonic music&quot; is described along with its marvellous effects[7]:</p><p>              First there are obtained perfect fifths above the<br/>              white keys of the common organ, which make a<br/>              wonderful sound; then two kinds of thirds, one<br/>              major, one minor, and similarly, two kinds of<br/>              sixths, in which case it happens that whenever<br/>              perfect fifths are struck together with perfect<br/>              thirds, they fill the ears with such harmony that<br/>              no better can be heard on earth.</p><p>Both Vicentino&apos;s adaptive tuning and the adaptive Xeno-Gothic scheme<br/>appear to have the following properties in common:</p><p>(1) Both systems make it possible to realize a complete set of<br/>sonorities featuring pure ratios: Vicentino&apos;s stable sonorities based<br/>on 5-limit ratios of 2-3-5, or stable and unstable Gothic/neo-Gothic<br/>sonorities based on ratios of 2-3-7.</p><p>(2) Each of the two manuals in itself represents a standard regular<br/>tuning: Vicentino&apos;s 19-note meantone (Gb-B#), or a Gothic/neo-Gothic<br/>12-note Pythagorean (Eb-G#).</p><p>(3) The notes of the upper keyboard are shifted by a slight interval<br/>to obtain pure ratios for vertical sonorities: by 1/4 syntonic comma<br/>(~5.38 cents) in Vicentino&apos;s scheme, or a septimal schisma (~3.80<br/>cents) in the neo-Gothic scheme.</p><p>While both schemes yield pure vertical sonorities combining multiple<br/>prime factors (2-3-5 or 2-3-7), Vicentino&apos;s is based on a regular<br/>temperament, evidently 1/4-comma meantone: melodic intervals, and also<br/>vertical intervals in unstable sonorities, typically have irrational<br/>meantone ratios. Indeed the beauty and elegance of this system lies in<br/>its synthesis between the flexibility and regularity of a Renaissance<br/>temperament and the purity of just vertical concords.</p><p>In contrast, the adaptive neo-Gothic scheme is entirely based on<br/>integer ratios, a much easier solution in a medieval or neo-medieval<br/>setting than in a 5-limit Renaissance setting.[8] Such an &quot;adaptive<br/>rational&quot; scheme satisfies two additional properties:</p><p>(1) The regular tuning on each keyboard is also a just tuning based on<br/>integer ratios, namely Pythagorean intonation; and</p><p>(2) The small interval of adjustment between the two keyboards is<br/>itself rational, here the septimal schisma of 33554432:33480783 (~3.80<br/>cents), so that all ratios in the scheme remain integer-based.</p><p>In one obvious respect, Vicentino&apos;s system shares the melodic<br/>smoothness and regularity of meantone while our neo-Gothic adaptive<br/>system exemplifies the intricacy or unevenness of classic multi-prime<br/>JI systems: the matter of commas and comma shifts.</p><p>-------------------------------------------<br/>3.1. Commas and melodic evenness/unevenness<br/>-------------------------------------------</p><p>Vicentino&apos;s system, like a usual meantone temperament, disperses the<br/>syntonic or 3-5 comma (81:80, ~21.51 cents) by narrowing each regular<br/>fifth by 1/4 of this amount, equal to the 5.38-cent adjustment between<br/>the two manuals. In progressing from one pure vertical sonority to the<br/>next, the usual meantone melodic intervals need vary by only this<br/>small amount, rather than by a full syntonic comma as often happens in<br/>classic Renaissance JI.</p><p>In contrast, the adaptive neo-Gothic system features the classic<br/>septimal or 3-7 comma (64:63, ~27.26 cents); notably unequal<br/>whole-steps of 9:8 and 8:7, and sometimes direct melodic progressions<br/>by a septimal comma (Section 4), are characteristic, whether regarded<br/>as blemishes or adornments.</p><p>As discussed in Part I, Section 1, this latter system has effectively<br/>exchanged one comma for another: the Pythagorean or 2-3 comma which<br/>would normally obtain between the manuals is enlarged by a septimal<br/>schisma to a septimal comma, making pure 7-based sonorities possible.</p><p>Here we might add that Vicentino himself ardently advocates another<br/>kind of striking melodic shift: the enharmonic shift of a meantone<br/>diesis, equivalent to a 2-3 comma (in 1/4-comma tuning, typically<br/>128:125 or ~41.06 cents). However, such shifts are an optional and<br/>expressive effect providing a prime motivation for his other<br/>archicembalo/arciorgano tuning dividing the octave into 31 essentially<br/>equal steps of 1/5-tone, rather than an integral and necessary feature<br/>of his adaptive JI system.[9]</p><p>The question of the commas invites a comparison of the practical<br/>challenges and opportunities which keyboardists may encounter using<br/>these two systems in the lively musical settings for which they are<br/>designed.</p><p>-----------------------------------------------------<br/>3.2. Commas and stable concords: A keyboardist&apos;s view<br/>-----------------------------------------------------</p><p>While the presence of an unexpurgated septimal comma in the neo-Gothic<br/>system makes it in some ways more intricate, Vicentino&apos;s system may<br/>actually offer a more arduous task for the performer who wishes to<br/>maintain pure concords wherever possible. This is true in part because<br/>of the distinctions of vertical stability/instability involved in each<br/>case.</p><p>In Gothic or neo-Gothic music, the complete stable sonority is the<br/>three-voice trine (e.g. D3-A3-D4, 2:3:4). In our adaptive scheme, as<br/>in a usual Pythagorean tuning, all regularly fifths and fourths on<br/>each keyboard -- and therefore complete trines -- are pure. One need<br/>only play them in the usual manner.[10]</p><p>In Vicentino&apos;s 16th-century system, however, playing any full 5-limit<br/>concord (Zarlino&apos;s _harmonia perfetta_) requires mixing notes from the<br/>two keyboards in order to obtain pure fifths (or fourths) and minor<br/>thirds (or major sixths).</p><p>Of course, such mixing of notes from the two manuals is required in<br/>the neo-Gothic scheme to obtain pure 7-flavor versions of unstable<br/>sonorities. However, the typical vertical spacing of such medieval or<br/>neo-medieval sonorities can simplify this task. In many three-voice or<br/>four-voice progressions, the widest vertical interval negotiated by a<br/>single hand is characteristically a fifth or fourth:</p><p>             E^4 F4                    F4  E^4<br/>E^4 F4       D4  C4       F4  E^3      D^4 E^4      D4 E^4 F4<br/>B^3 C4       B^3 C4       Bb3 A^3      Bb3 A^3      C4 B^3 C4<br/>G3  F3       G3  F3       G^3 A^3      G^3 A^3      G3     F3</p><p>While keeping the right hand on the right manual at the right time<br/>remains a challenge, the keyboardist is at least assured of a friendly<br/>&quot;landing&quot; on a trine or fifth conveniently located on a single manual.</p><p>In contrast, let us see what is involved in some routine Renaissance<br/>progressions at Vicentino&apos;s keyboard if we wish to maintain pure<br/>concords for any length of time:</p><p>G4   F&apos;4     B4   C&apos;5    A4   B4     A&apos;4  G#4    G4   F#4<br/>D&apos;4  D4      G4   A4     E&apos;4  G4     D4   E4     D4&apos;  D4<br/>B3   A&apos;3     D&apos;4  F4     C&apos;4  D&apos;4    A&apos;3  B&apos;3    Bb&apos;3 A&apos;3<br/>G3   D3      G3   F3     A3   G3     F&apos;3  E3     G2   D3</p><p>As these examples may illustrate, we can indeed progress between pure<br/>vertical sonorities with smooth and virtually regular melodic steps,<br/>but with a complication more generally noted for the archicembalo by<br/>Ercole Bottrigari in 1594[11]:</p><p>              &quot;[T]he player must many times press and hold down<br/>               down with one hand some keys of both keyboards<br/>               at the same time, and occasionally do this with<br/>               both hands at once.&quot;</p><p>Possibly new and more ergonomic keyboard designs may alleviate the<br/>mechanical difficulties of needing to mix notes from both keyboards,<br/>frequently within a single hand, &quot;whenever perfect fifths are struck<br/>with perfect thirds,&quot; to borrow Vicentino&apos;s phrase.</p><p>Happily, both adaptive systems provide a &quot;safety valve&quot; for the<br/>intrepid keyboardist, who is free to revert to a regular and<br/>stylistically felicitous tuning system readily at hand as a subset of<br/>the full scheme: 19-note Renaissance meantone for the player of<br/>Vicentino&apos;s instrument, or 12-note medieval Pythagorean for the player<br/>of the neo-Gothic instrument.</p><p>This flexibility might serve not only as a concession to the<br/>beleaguered performer, but as a musical virtue: the opportunity to mix<br/>and contrast pure sonorities with more complex ones. In a neo-Gothic<br/>setting, complex Pythagorean versions of unstable sonorities are<br/>valued and cultivated in their own right alongside pure 7-flavor<br/>versions. In Vicentino&apos;s system, for example, the playing of certain<br/>passages with a subtle contrast between pure major thirds and the<br/>tempered minor thirds in a usual meantone fashion could add a welcome<br/>note of musical variety[12], alongside other passages featuring pure<br/>fifths and thirds.</p><p>In short, both adaptive systems may have the advantage of combining<br/>the musically routine with the extraordinary, giving the performer the<br/>creative scope for choice in seeking out effects both old and new.</p><p>-----<br/>Notes<br/>-----</p><p>1. See, e.g., Margo Schulter and David Keenan, &quot;The Golden Mediant:<br/>Complex ratios and metastable musical intervals,&quot; Tuning Digest 810:3,<br/>18 September 2000; <a href="http://www.egroups.com/message/tuning/12915">http://www.egroups.com/message/tuning/12915</a>. Note<br/>that the term &quot;Noble Mediant&quot; might now be preferred in the title, as<br/>suggested by Dave Keenan.</p><p>2. For these standard forms of 7-flavor cadences with melodic steps of<br/>9:8 and 28:27, the general rule is that intensive progressions (with<br/>ascending semitones) resolve to a trine or fifth on the lower manual,<br/>while remissive progressions (with descending semitones) resolve to<br/>the upper manual. Another way of stating this pattern: melodic<br/>whole-tones are played on the same keyboard (e.g. G3-F3, E^4-F#^4);<br/>ascending semitones move from the upper to the lower keyboard<br/>(e.g. B^3-C4, E^4-F4); and descending semitones from the lower to the<br/>upper keyboard (e.g. F3-E^3, C4-B^3).</p><p>3. In contrast, the 15th-century shift in Western Europe from active<br/>Pythagorean thirds and sixths to 5-limit &quot;valley&quot; tunings resulted in<br/>larger cadential semitones and less efficient resolutions. Major<br/>thirds at 5:4 (~386.31 cents) and major sixths at 5:3 (~884.36 cents)<br/>are a syntonic comma (81:80, ~21.51 cents) _narrower_ than their<br/>Pythagorean counterparts, while minor thirds at 6:5 (~315.64 cents)<br/>are _wider_ by this same amount. The m3-1, M3-5, and M6-8 resolutions<br/>thus require this extra amount of expansion or contraction, a total<br/>distance of a rounded 316 cents (the size of the 6:5 minor third).<br/>Cadential semitones in a pure 5-limit tuning are typically 16:15<br/>(~111.73 cents), again a syntonic comma larger than Pythagorean. On<br/>early Renaissance tension between the musical values of smoother<br/>thirds and incisive cadential semitones, see also Mark Lindley,<br/>&quot;Pythagorean Intonation and the Rise of the Triad,&quot; _Royal Musical<br/>Association Research Chronicle_ 16:4-61 at 45 (1980), ISSN 0080-4460;<br/>and &quot;Pythagorean Intonation,&quot; _New Grove Dictionary of Music and<br/>Musicians_ 15:485-487, ed. Stanley Sadie, Washington, DC: Grove&apos;s<br/>Dictionaries of Music (1980), ISBN 0333231112.</p><p>4. While the musical style is derived from that of Gothic Europe, the<br/>mixture of melodic semitones and major thirds might somehow evoke for<br/>me also the Balinese or Javanese pelog and Japanese pentatonic scales<br/>featuring these intervals.</p><p>5. In the right setting, these narrow fourths (21:16, ~470.78 cents) and<br/>wide fifths (32:21, ~529.22 cents) might present an opportunity for<br/>special effects rather than a problem. Keenan Pepper, for example, has<br/>extolled the &quot;crunchiness&quot; of 21:16, and neo-Gothic styles favor many<br/>varieties of altered or &quot;less usual&quot; intervals.</p><p>6.

In a neo-Gothic JI system (factors of 2-3-7) based entirely on<br/>integer ratios, stable trines (2:3:4 or 3:4:6) are free from the<br/>complications of the septimal or 3-7 comma at 64:63. In contrast, in a<br/>Renaissance JI system (factors of 2-3-5), stable sonorities combining<br/>Vicentino&apos;s &quot;perfect fifths and perfect thirds&quot; (4:5:6 or 10:12:15)<br/>squarely confront the problem of the syntonic or 3-5 comma at 81:80.<br/>As we shall see in Section 3.2, even Vicentino&apos;s system, while it<br/>succeeds in dispersing the syntonic comma, bears some sign of this<br/>greater complication by requiring the performer to mix notes from both<br/>manuals whenever such a &quot;perfect&quot; Renaissance sonority is desired.</p><p>9. Vicentino&apos;s adaptive system offering sonorities where all fifths<br/>and thirds are &quot;perfect,&quot; as well as his first or circulating 31-note<br/>scheme for his archicembalo and arciorgano, would nicely fit a base<br/>tuning of 1/4-comma meantone for the first 12 notes of the lower<br/>manual, which Vicentino simply directs should be tuned as on usual<br/>keyboard instruments, with the fifths slightly narrowed or &quot;blunted.&quot;</p><p>10. In an &quot;avant-garde&quot; neo-Gothic style which acted on the view of<br/>Jacobus of Liege that 9:1 (a major 23rd, e.g. D3-E6) is a &quot;perfect<br/>concord&quot; by treating sonorities such as D3-A5-E6 (1:6:9) as stable,<br/>these 3-prime-limit sonorities would also be available in their usual<br/>locations on either keyboard.</p><p>11.
