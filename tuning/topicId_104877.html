Of course, I agree that it&apos;s not too<br/>far from 7/5, but would typically describe it as a<br/>tempered version of 39/28 at 573.657 cents.</p><p>The 39/28 is the inversion of 56/39, a ratio occurring<br/>in the medieval Near Eastern mode called Buzurg described<br/>around 1300. While Safi al-Din al-Urmawi gives the general<br/>form of Buzurg, one of his commentators (Anonymous LXII if<br/>I&apos;m correct) gives the form of a Buzurg pentachord as<br/>1/1-14/13-16/13-4/3-56/39-3/2 (0-128-359-498-626-702 cents).</p><p>In a maqam context, 56/39 is equal to 4/3 plus 14/13 -- and<br/>its inversion, 39/28, to 3/2 less 14/13, a small neutral<br/>second favored by Ibn Sina and Safi al-Din, the latter of<br/>whom tells us in one work that it is common to find 14/13<br/>as the most favored neutral second step in frettings.</p><p>Another interval in this general range even closer to 7/5<br/>is 88/63 or 578.582 cents, equal to 4/3 plus 22/21. It seems<br/>the best JI equivalent for an interval of 577.7 cents I have<br/>in MET-24, a system which, as a strict rank 3 temperament<br/>in 2048-EDO, would have generators of 703.711 cents, 2/1,<br/>and 57.422 cents.</p><p>This interval plays a very prominent role in a possible<br/>historical Ottoman shading of a maqam called Penchgah,<br/>open to at least two interpretations. One has the first<br/>three notes as in Rast, but with T-J-T-J instead of<br/>T-J-J-T, where T is a regular tone and J a neutral<br/>second. Thus Rast would here be around 1/1-9/8-26/21-4/3-3/2,<br/>and Penchgah 1/1-9/8-26/21-88/63-3/2. In MET-24, this comes<br/>to 0-207.4-370.3-577.7-703.7 (in the 2048-EDO version). In a<br/>1024-EDO version, not precisely regular because two different<br/>fifth sizes are required (703.125 or 704.297 cents), the intervals<br/>would be identical aside from the 3/2 step which would have one<br/>of these two sizes.</p><p>A recommended 5-limit tuning of Ozan Yarman -- who seems open<br/>to historical tunings also with wide neutral rather than 5-limit<br/>thirds and sevenths -- is 1/1-9/8-5/4-7/5-3/2-27/16-15/8-2/1, if<br/>I recall correctly. Here, interestingly, the tritone step of<br/>1/1-9/8-26/21-88/63-3/2-22/13-13/7-2/1, as a JI interpretation<br/>of 0-207.4-370.3-577.7-703.1-910.5-1073.4-1200 cents, is within<br/>five cents of Yarman&apos;s 7/5.</p><p>In temperaments of this range around 704 cents, the realm of<br/>&quot;gentle temperaments&quot; or &quot;the 704-cent neighborhood,&quot; a regular<br/>tone somewhere around 207-209 cents may be taken as a representation<br/>of either 9/8 or 44/39. In the latter interpretation, the tone<br/>is divided into a diatonic semitone close to 22/21 plus a chromatic<br/>semitone close to 14/13. Thus we&apos;re likely to find a diminished<br/>fifth (six fifths down) somewhere around 39/28 (3/2 less 14/13)<br/>or 88/63 (4/3 plus 22/21).</p><p>Best,</p><p>Margo Schulter<br/>mschulter@...</p></div><h3><a id=104878 href="#104878">ðŸ”—</a>Mike Battaglia &#x3C;battaglia01@...&#x3E;</h3><span>7/23/2012 9:36:51 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Hi Margo!
