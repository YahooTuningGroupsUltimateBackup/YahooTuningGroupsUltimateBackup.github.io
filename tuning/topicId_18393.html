The third line under that says<br/>&gt;&quot;eGroups users&quot;, and under that is says &quot;Link your accounts here&quot;.<br/>&gt;Click on that and the rest should be self-explanatory (I hope!)</p><p>I had two identities in egroups (<a href="mailto:jdl@adaptune.com">jdl@adaptune.com</a> and <a href="mailto:jdl@keymark.com">jdl@keymark.com</a>).<br/>One of them changed over to Yahoo just as you described; the other<br/>didn&apos;t.  Nothing I tried would get it to take.  I finally had to cancel<br/>it by sending an unsubscribe message.  It was a major pain in the a**,<br/>and did not make me feel very kindly toward Yahoo!</p><p>JdL</p></div>
