Of course, the one with 19 notes is closest to<br/>Blackjack, but that&apos;s not so surprising.

The noteworthy feature is<br/>another one noted by Scala: &quot;Scale contains a complete diamond 1 3 5<br/>7&quot;. So it&apos;s both permutation epimorphic, giving it a certain kind of<br/>regularity, and it contains a 7-limit tonality diamond, all in a<br/>compass of 18 notes.

One doesn&apos;t always need that regularity, and it can<br/>be stifling.</p><p>I certainly &quot;think like Kraig&quot;, at least in respect of the primacy of<br/>melody over harmony in the music I make.  If Kraig &quot;doesn&apos;t like the idea<br/>of measuring the worth&quot; [_utility_?] &quot;of such scales by chord counts&quot;,<br/>that&apos;s not surprising given his preference for melodic values.  In fact,<br/>it might be said that in a multilinear, contrapuntal style, where Melody is<br/>King, while passing and accidental harmonies are but graces in its court,<br/>necessarily, the number of _discords_ is a good measure of the richness,<br/>variety and colour brought to that court by a well-chosen scale ...</p><p>As you wrote -<br/>&gt; The sheer number of possibilities is boggling.</p><p>And this is how it struck me, with every new digest from the lists<br/>bringing yet more varieties of scales from the fertile inventions of<br/>yourself and others, Ossa piled on Pelion.  I thought: &quot;But of what use<br/>are they all?  And how could I ever hope to mine their riches, in the few<br/>short years of a human lifetime?&quot;  I dwelt on this at length, with some<br/>perplexity, and finally, a faint glimmer of an answer arrived, carried as<br/>an unseen passenger, a tiny mite on the feather of the email pigeon.  At<br/>last, I seized on it, and bent the microscope upon it, and all was clear:<br/>its name was Purpose.  &quot;If you want to do this&quot;, you wrote, &quot;then such-<br/>and-such will suit you better than so-and-so.&quot;  And I saw that it was so.<br/>The saga was at an end, and I had passed from the Val[e] of Perplexity<br/>into the Sunny Plains of Clear Intent!</p><p>Given these values:<br/>1.  The ability to produce melodies of varied character, strong and supple,<br/>light and nuanced, agonised or tender, brutal, pleading, martial, joyous,<br/>coquettish, robust, serene, peaceful, transcendent ... you name it!<br/>2.  The ability to have those melodies interact freely, as characters in a<br/>story, through passing harmonies and discords;</p><p>- any scale system that supports those values is &quot;good&quot; to exactly the<br/>degree that it supports those values, and &quot;bad&quot; to exactly the degree<br/>that it fails to support those values.</p><p>But the values come first.  Choose a different set of values (these are<br/>mine) and you will require different scale materials - different musical<br/>resources.  Thus, it seems to me that the answer to your question is simply<br/>and necessarily a relative one; each individual may give an individual<br/>answer, which is, for all that, objective rather than subjective.  To be<br/>objective, one merely needs to know one&apos;s objectives!  ... as one can then<br/>measure against them.  But there are NO universal musical objectives; it<br/>follows that there can be no universal measure of value.  Instead, every<br/>measure is _based_ on a set of values, which may be personal preferences<br/>engendered by chance circumstances.</p><p>I prefer the melodic virtues to the harmonic.  While I do not decry the<br/>latter, I&apos;m more likely to pursue the former.  Therefore I want scales<br/>which give me good (easy and accurate) melodic leaps and steps, and<br/>enough of them to give sufficient variety that I can use them expressively.<br/>As a byproduct, I&apos;m likely to find that a scale with these melodic virtues<br/>will also possess some harmonic ones, providing a pleasing variety of both<br/>concords and discords.   Rather than counting the triads, of any type,<br/>I&apos;d count the intervals within the scale.  How many fifths does it give me?<br/>and how good are they?  Thirds?  Seconds?  What kinds are they?  These<br/>are the questions by which I, personally, rate the utility of a scale.

A couple of the small steps here and<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; there, but a larger chromatic feel.  Very curious.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; Thanks for the feedback. It is awfully quirky compared to Blackjack,<br/>&gt; &gt; but it packs a lot of septimal harmony into 18 notes. Kraig doesn&apos;t<br/>&gt; &gt; like the idea of measuring the worth of such scales by chord counts,<br/>&gt; &gt; but if you abandon the theory that scales should be highly regular and<br/>&gt; &gt; not quirky, what else do you have as a way of assessing them? I&apos;d like<br/>&gt; &gt; feedback on that, especially from people who think like Kraig. Saying<br/>&gt; &gt; with Jon that there is no such thing as a bad scale is not of any use<br/>&gt; &gt; as input either; use another word than &quot;bad&quot; if you prefer, but I<br/>&gt; &gt; still would like ideas on what makes a scale worthy of consideration.<br/>&gt; &gt; The sheer number of possibilities is boggling.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; P.S...  I didn&apos;t realize, Gene, how many scales you already had in<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; the Scala archives a this point...<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; I was a little surprised by that also; a few years back and there were<br/>&gt; &gt; none.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Gene,<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; ... if you abandon the theory that scales should be highly regular and<br/>&gt; &gt; not quirky ...<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I did so long ago.  One doesn&apos;t always need that regularity, and it can<br/>&gt; be stifling.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I certainly &quot;think like Kraig&quot;, at least in respect of the primacy of<br/>&gt; melody over harmony in the music I make.  If Kraig &quot;doesn&apos;t like the<br/>idea<br/>&gt; of measuring the worth&quot; [_utility_?] &quot;of such scales by chord counts&quot;,<br/>&gt; that&apos;s not surprising given his preference for melodic values.  In fact,<br/>&gt; it might be said that in a multilinear, contrapuntal style, where<br/>Melody is<br/>&gt; King, while passing and accidental harmonies are but graces in its<br/>court,<br/>&gt; necessarily, the number of _discords_ is a good measure of the richness,<br/>&gt; variety and colour brought to that court by a well-chosen scale ...<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; As you wrote -<br/>&gt; &gt; The sheer number of possibilities is boggling.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; And this is how it struck me, with every new digest from the lists<br/>&gt; bringing yet more varieties of scales from the fertile inventions of<br/>&gt; yourself and others, Ossa piled on Pelion.  I thought: &quot;But of what use<br/>&gt; are they all?  And how could I ever hope to mine their riches, in<br/>the few<br/>&gt; short years of a human lifetime?&quot;  I dwelt on this at length, with some<br/>&gt; perplexity, and finally, a faint glimmer of an answer arrived,<br/>carried as<br/>&gt; an unseen passenger, a tiny mite on the feather of the email pigeon.  At<br/>&gt; last, I seized on it, and bent the microscope upon it, and all was<br/>clear:<br/>&gt; its name was Purpose.  &quot;If you want to do this&quot;, you wrote, &quot;then such-<br/>&gt; and-such will suit you better than so-and-so.&quot;  And I saw that it<br/>was so.<br/>&gt; The saga was at an end, and I had passed from the Val[e] of Perplexity<br/>&gt; into the Sunny Plains of Clear Intent!<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Given these values:<br/>&gt; 1.  The ability to produce melodies of varied character, strong and<br/>supple,<br/>&gt; light and nuanced, agonised or tender, brutal, pleading, martial,<br/>joyous,<br/>&gt; coquettish, robust, serene, peaceful, transcendent ... you name it!<br/>&gt; 2.  The ability to have those melodies interact freely, as<br/>characters in a<br/>&gt; story, through passing harmonies and discords;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; - any scale system that supports those values is &quot;good&quot; to exactly the<br/>&gt; degree that it supports those values, and &quot;bad&quot; to exactly the degree<br/>&gt; that it fails to support those values.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; But the values come first.  Choose a different set of values (these are<br/>&gt; mine) and you will require different scale materials - different musical<br/>&gt; resources.  Thus, it seems to me that the answer to your question is<br/>simply<br/>&gt; and necessarily a relative one; each individual may give an individual<br/>&gt; answer, which is, for all that, objective rather than subjective.  To be<br/>&gt; objective, one merely needs to know one&apos;s objectives!  ... as one<br/>can then<br/>&gt; measure against them.  But there are NO universal musical objectives; it<br/>&gt; follows that there can be no universal measure of value.  Instead, every<br/>&gt; measure is _based_ on a set of values, which may be personal preferences<br/>&gt; engendered by chance circumstances.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I prefer the melodic virtues to the harmonic.  While I do not decry the<br/>&gt; latter, I&apos;m more likely to pursue the former.  Therefore I want scales<br/>&gt; which give me good (easy and accurate) melodic leaps and steps, and<br/>&gt; enough of them to give sufficient variety that I can use them<br/>expressively.<br/>&gt; As a byproduct, I&apos;m likely to find that a scale with these melodic<br/>virtues<br/>&gt; will also possess some harmonic ones, providing a pleasing variety<br/>of both<br/>&gt; concords and discords.   Rather than counting the triads, of any type,<br/>&gt; I&apos;d count the intervals within the scale.  How many fifths does it<br/>give me?<br/>&gt; and how good are they?  Thirds?  Seconds?  What kinds are they?  These<br/>&gt; are the questions by which I, personally, rate the utility of a<br/>scale.  But<br/>&gt; I won&apos;t pretend that I do so very systematically; often, in fact, a<br/>scale<br/>&gt; results from the cumulative melodic choices I make.  So much so, that in<br/>&gt; the light of a finished composition, I&apos;m left wondering what kind of<br/>fourth,<br/>&gt; or seventh, or some other &quot;omitted&quot; degree, the scale might have.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; HT(rambling)H!   :-)<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Yahya<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; --<br/>&gt; No virus found in this outgoing message.<br/>&gt; Checked by AVG Anti-Virus.<br/>&gt; Version: 7.0.323 / Virus Database: 267.8.9/41 - Release Date: 5/7/05</p></div><h3><a id=59314 href="#59314">ðŸ”—</a>Gene Ward Smith &#x3C;gwsmith@svpal.org&#x3E;</h3><span>7/10/2005 3:30:08 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;Yahya Abdal-Aziz&quot; &lt;yahya@m...&gt; wrote:</p><p>&gt; I certainly &quot;think like Kraig&quot;, at least in respect of the primacy of<br/>&gt; melody over harmony in the music I make.
