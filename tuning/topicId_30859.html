Wow what an<br/>interpretation.  Really what I would call a barebones ensemble yet<br/>achieving everything the piece has to offer.  It was an acoustic marvel.</p><p>The set up and the vocal production were unique.  The tempos, really<br/>fast.  He had the 5 soloist up front, looking at the stage they were on<br/>the right.  The choir was divided into two groups so that you were<br/>hearing the four voices coming from both the right and the left.  These<br/>were considerably reduced voices so the effect was stunning.  Four<br/>sopranos total, two altos, two tenors and two basses.  The clarity was<br/>outstanding and you didn&apos;t lose anything.  That was the surprising<br/>result.  And as I recall, the two sopranos didn&apos;t stand side by side.  I</p><p>think it was arranged so that the alto stood in between the two<br/>sopranos.  So when you heard, say for instance, the tenor entrance, the<br/>fact that you had two tenor voices coming at you in stereo made up for<br/>the fact that there were only two tenors instead of say five to eight<br/>grouped together.</p><p>What a tight group.  The vocal production was interesting too.  They<br/>seemed to sing out of the sides of their mouths like they were caressing</p><p>every note, like when you are  pronouncing a language extra carefully.<br/>So obviously diction was of the highest importance.  But this lent a<br/>special advantage to the performance, where the text really shines.</p><p>And the tempos were amazingly fast, especially in the solos.  Yet when<br/>the soloist entered, the movement didn&apos;t seem so fast.  And when the<br/>last movement finally arrived, the full sound of the orchestra and choir</p><p>just rang out making complete sense of the whole effort, because the<br/>sound was absolutely satisfying.</p><p>If the group heads your way, the $35 ticket price is well worth it.<br/>They said at the cd stand in the foyer that Andrew Parrott has a cd out<br/>of the B Minor Mass (he conducts the Tavener Consort) and is available<br/>on the uk version of <a href="http://amazon.com">amazon.com</a> which I think they said was<br/><a href="http://amazonuk.com">amazonuk.com</a>.</p><p>The valveless French horn of course was a real treat.</p><p>Yours,<br/>Rick</p></div><h3><a id=30860 href="#30860">ðŸ”—</a>Jon Szanto &#x3C;JSZANTO@ADNC.COM&#x3E;</h3><span>11/30/2001 1:49:22 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In tuning@y..., Rick Tagawa &lt;ricktagawa@e...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt; I attended an outstanding performance last night at the Barclay<br/>&gt; Theater in Irvine by the San Francisco based Philharmonia baroque<br/>&gt; Orchestra conducted by Andrew Parrott doing Bach&apos;s B Minor Mass.</p><p>Sounds great, Rick. The PBO is really a wonderful ensemble, from what<br/>I&apos;ve heard on a number of recordings (they have a great Handel &quot;Judas<br/>Maccabaeus&quot;); their founding conductor, Nicholas McGegan, conducted<br/>the San Diego Symphony last season, and it was truly a joyous and<br/>fresh music-making experience. I&apos;m hoping we&apos;ll have him back again<br/>in the future.</p><p>I second the motion to check them out if they come to a town near<br/>you...</p><p>Cheers,<br/>Jon</p></div>
