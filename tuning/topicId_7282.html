In our off-list discussion, you told me that the<br/>&gt; singers sing a major third _higher_ than the 12-tET one in a major triad,<br/>&gt; and yet now you say the Pythagorean third is _way_ too sharp. There is only<br/>&gt; 8 cents difference between the two. 8 cents is about the smallest<br/>&gt; distinguishable melodic interval.</p><p>Paul, you are right. (Again!) Thanks for the correction. John link noted the<br/>same point and commented off list.</p><p>I suspect that what I remember about the aural comparison (experienced many<br/>years ago) was that they were not nearly the same. John did some<br/>experimenting on his guitar regarding the &quot;high third&quot; and will likely be<br/>posting some interesting findings after he finishes his CD and has the time<br/>to get back into the list discussions. In general, he experienced the &quot;high<br/>third&quot; as being considerably higher than Pythagorean. He played it for me<br/>over the phone (remember those?) and it is indeed the third that I commonly<br/>hear as the &quot;singer&apos;s third.&quot;</p><p>Jerry</p></div><h3><a id=7283 href="#7283">ðŸ”—</a>Gerald Eskelin &#x3C;stg3music@xxxxxxxxx.xxxx&#x3E;</h3><span>12/26/1999 1:39:16 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>I wrote:</p><p>&gt;&gt;(It also seems unlikely that this &quot;high third&quot;<br/>&gt;&gt;is a product of culture, since it appears to be arrived at in terms of<br/>&gt;&gt;consonance, as opposed to learned preference.)</p><p>And Paul Erlich replied:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I don&apos;t know how you propose to back up that assertion. In fact, studies<br/>&gt; have shown that untrained listeners tend to fall into two groups, one group<br/>&gt; preferring a just major triad, and another group preferring a major triad<br/>&gt; with the third either 15 cents sharp (as in 12-tET) or 15 cents flat, over<br/>&gt; the just major triad. I would argue that these listeners have been<br/>&gt; conditioned by a lifetime of exposure to the characteristic beating thirds<br/>&gt; of 12-tET.</p><p>Actually, I don&apos;t propose to back up that assertion. It is simply an opinion<br/>that to me seems to reflect common tuning practices of the singers I have<br/>worked with over a half century.</p><p>Perhaps the experiment you cite does not really apply since it seems to have<br/>been conducted using listeners rather than singers. Nevertheless, it is<br/>interesting and thanks for mentioning it. BTW, wouldn&apos;t that be THREE<br/>groups? 1) just, 2) 15 cents sharp, 3) 15 cents flat. ??? If the &quot;another&quot;<br/>group was responding to &quot;either&quot; the sharp or the flat tunings, we still<br/>don&apos;t know whether they might have preferred some other tuning. Perhaps the<br/>&quot;another&quot; group were lumped together as simply &quot;wrong.&quot; (Many questions<br/>unanswered here.)</p><p>I personally don&apos;t find a &quot;consonant&quot; tuning below what I hear as the 4:5<br/>third (until I reach the 5:6 third, of course). Also, the singers I have<br/>been listening to (since high school) always move upward when the fifth is<br/>introduced and lock in at the &quot;high third.&quot; The reason I am confident in<br/>making that statement is that I have &quot;always&quot; tuned my thirds in the high<br/>position and was surprised (naively) to learn, a few years back, that the<br/>acoustic third 4:5 is actually below 12-tET major third. (Old dogs---new<br/>tricks---etc.)</p><p>Regarding your reference to the &quot;lifetime of exposure to the characteristic<br/>beating thirds of 12-tET,&quot; if such a third were &quot;preferred&quot; by singers it<br/>seems to me that they would gravitate toward a 400 cent third. They<br/>apparently don&apos;t--likely because it simply doesn&apos;t &quot;lock&quot; there. The point<br/>here is that when the &quot;high third&quot; is sounding &quot;in tune&quot; with the root and<br/>fifth, beating is minimal and the tuning &quot;locks.&quot;</p><p>Understand, Paul, none of this is intended as a refutation of anything you<br/>have said above. I am simply trying to clarify my description of what I have<br/>observed. Since we all interpret words in terms of our own experience,<br/>descriptions sometimes create more confusion than insight. I guess that&apos;s<br/>what &quot;conversation&quot; is for. :-)</p><p>Your turn.

His point was (one made in this List over and over<br/>&gt; again) that chords which divide the &apos;octave&apos; into a certain<br/>&gt; number of identical intervals, for example, an &apos;augmented<br/>&gt; triad&apos; with 3 &apos;major 3rds&apos; or a &apos;diminished 7th&apos; with 4<br/>&gt; &apos;minor 3rds&apos;, generally only &apos;work&apos; when tuned in an appropriate<br/>&gt; ET; 12-tET in the case of the two examples given.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Some have argued that composers would not have used these<br/>&gt; two particular chords in the particular ways they did (and do),<br/>&gt; especially around 100 years ago (say from around Wagner to<br/>&gt; Schoenberg and Debussy), if 12-tET had not become the accepted<br/>&gt; norm and thus influenced these composers&apos;s thinking.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I think it&apos;s significant that Schoenberg in particular found<br/>&gt; so much to explore among the &apos;augmented triads&apos;, &apos;diminished 7th<br/>&gt; chords&apos;, and &apos;4th-chords&apos;, all of which pretty much require<br/>&gt; 12-tET, since it is the smallest ET which can produce them all<br/>&gt; within a closed system.</p><p>Thanks, Monz, for your clarification, and also for your informative<br/>elaboration regarding historical use.</p><p>Speaking of Schoenberg, are you familiar with William Thompson&apos;s book<br/>&quot;Schoenberg&apos;s Error&quot;? Essentially, he proposes that Schoenberg appears to<br/>have noted the &quot;trend&quot; toward atonality and, because he didn&apos;t look back in<br/>history far enough for a larger perspective, simply jumped in front of the<br/>parade. His point, of course, is that the parade has now largely dissipated.<br/>(Thank goodness!!!)</p><p>G.
