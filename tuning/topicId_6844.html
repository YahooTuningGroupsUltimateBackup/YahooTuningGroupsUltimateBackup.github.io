I believe if the average music listener heard a brass<br/>&gt;&gt;choir play in 12tet, they would say they were out of tune.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;I don&apos;t think so.  They may notice something was wrong, but I don&apos;t think<br/>&gt;they&apos;d realise it was the tuning.</p><p>Gentlemen, such sweeping statements.  Who is this average music listener?<br/>Last week I had the pleasure of hearing the American Brass Quartet in a<br/>very intimate setting.  This is arguably the world&apos;s best quintet, and<br/>their intonation is astounding -- in everything from early music to the<br/>latest Sampson quintet featuring &quot;cloud&quot;-like tone clusters.  Everyone in<br/>my party commented on the intonation, as did another fellow I happened to<br/>overhear afterwards.</p><p>&gt;Yes.  But isn&apos;t it striking that so many other genres of music DO<br/>&gt;encourage improvisation, rearrangement, etc.?  How, and importantly<br/>&gt;WHEN, did classical music become subject to this rigidified attitude?</p><p>Never!  The best composers and performers have always borrowed and<br/>experimented.  Bach made folk songs and sacred hymns into fugues, wrote<br/>dances in the style of Scarlatti... Ravel orchestrated Musorgsky... ELP<br/>re-orchestrated Musorgsky... The Byrds sang Dylan... Dylan sang folk<br/>music... Glenn Gould played everything as strangely as possible...  In Jazz<br/>they don&apos;t even bother to notate everything.</p><p>-Carl</p></div>
