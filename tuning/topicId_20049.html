Clearly, I<br/>practice the third definition.  For me all music is microtonal.</p><p>In my mind, I think of the early editions of the Harvard Dictionary of Music<br/>for the first definition, and John Cage for clearly delineating the second<br/>(Musicage: John Cage converses with Joan Retallack, Wesleyan,1996).  The<br/>American Festival of Microtonal Music (since 1981) was established to present<br/>a forum for alternatives to convention, and so admittedly followed this<br/>second definition.</p><p>As the director of the AFMM, I always believed strongly in the third<br/>definition, of a continuum of sound that had infinite points, only to be made<br/>sensible in music.  That, however, was to be nurtured in Johnny Reinhard, the<br/>composer.  I always believed, if not hoped, that there would indeed be a<br/>development, if not evolution, of the meaning of the term, at least as it<br/>applied in my region of the world.  I could always rationalize that the<br/>concert forum was simply a response to demand (&quot;12 equal could be heard<br/>anywhere else&quot;).  Now, we begin to present great works of music, wherein<br/>12-tET is one of the tunings that has spawned great music composition.  Of<br/>course, we all recognize on this list that &quot;early music&quot; can be described as<br/>microtonal by all 3 definitions of the FAQ.</p><p>It seems to me that developing a career that is visible (allowing for vital<br/>feedback) aids greatly in development, if not the evolution, of the meaning<br/>of things.  That a &quot;microtonal interval&quot; can be any interval is a scary<br/>concept to accept for some, and I am sorry for any discomfort it may elicit.<br/>Years ago, Jonathan Glasier reviewed my views sentiments (published in the<br/>&quot;Microtonal Issue&quot; of Ear Magazine) in Interval Magazine by saying my<br/>definition had &quot;muddied the waters,&quot; much as Daniel Wolf decried.  If so, it<br/>is the result of crystal clear imaging.  By using cents, along with ratios,<br/>one may navigate the entire continuum.</p><p>The difference between Ellis&apos; usage of cents and mine, is that I use<br/>imagination to create and perform, perhaps the reciprocal of his usage of<br/>cents.  I can flash the numbers to mind and hear their relationship, and then<br/>sing or play them.  He was reputed to have had a poor faculty for pitch<br/>recognition.  Incidentally, I was a poor student in classes in college for<br/>ear training and dictation.  Never had a private composition lesson (though I<br/>did perform a 3-year phenomenological study to better describe microtonality<br/>while attending Columbia University&apos;s Graduate School of Arts and Sciences on<br/>a fellowship).  Yep, &quot;all music is microtonal&quot; is the only definition that<br/>rang, and still rings right!</p><p>Yes, there can be a constant, a nexus point that can unite all tunings, and<br/>its location would at first seem arbitrary.  I have chosen A=440 as my<br/>constant since I can afford the one cent wiggle room, basically a biological<br/>reality.  And it is concurs with my regions&apos; convention.  This doesn&apos;t mean<br/>that I can&apos;t switch to another pitch center (as Jon Catler prefers) and build<br/>from there.</p><p>Last Thursday, I gave a lecture on microtonality at New York University.  It<br/>was wonderful to have a trio of my students there for support and<br/>demonstration.  And it was an exquisite evening, until my voice gave out,<br/>after 2 hours and 15 minutes of talk/play/improvise.  The 30 players<br/>performed first in 13-limit just and then, in quartertones.  People seemed to<br/>have developed, evolved into more understanding musicians.  I had carefully<br/>instructed them on the 3 different meaning of microtones that Margo described<br/>and left them to make up their own minds.  But based on the comments at the<br/>end, results have already taken place.  This &quot;microtonal lecture&quot; has been<br/>set up as an annual event at NYU.</p><p>Unless, one wants to be shackled, and I recognize the religious implications<br/>here, I recommend only a single nexus point.  Unless, of course, one is<br/>admittedly biased and prefers a different force of gravity.  There&apos;s nothing<br/>so sublime as a monophonic modulation.</p><p>So....I object to this being an alternative tuning list.</p><p>Respectfully, Johnny Reinhard</p></div><h3>jpehrson@rcn.com</h3><span>3/10/2001 10:04:41 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In tuning@y..., Afmmjr@a... wrote:</p><p><a href="http://groups.yahoo.com/group/tuning/message/20049">http://groups.yahoo.com/group/tuning/message/20049</a></p><p>&gt; I want to object, respectfully, to this being an alternative tuning<br/>list.
