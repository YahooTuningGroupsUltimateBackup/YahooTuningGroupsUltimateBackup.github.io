I&apos;ll probably agree, I<br/>&gt; just want to know what you&apos;re saying.<br/>&gt;<br/>Yes, there was an Arabic interpretation of what Greeks of the middle ages<br/>were doing, even though the written theories didn&apos;t jive always with actual<br/>aural information. The tuning today is STILL DIFFERENT again from whatever<br/>was practiced in &quot;17&quot;.  Essentially, these are interesting themes of tuning<br/>theory.  Either we get picky on all the modern meanings, or we get sloppy and<br/>fall into assumptions of what someone means.</p><p>&gt;  However, since there was<br/>&gt; &gt; so much use of spiraling fifths by ancient Babylonia, et al., it is<br/>&gt; much more<br/>&gt; &gt; likely that the term &quot;Greek&quot; was applied as erroneously as the name<br/>&gt; &gt; Pythagorus, itself.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Perhaps.<br/>&gt;<br/>Do you have ANY evidence to the contrary?</p><p>&gt; &gt; &gt; circumstantial evidence that they stumbled upon the schisma (much<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; as<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; the West did later, around 1420), since they used it to<br/>&gt; construct,<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; essentially, 5-limit just scales.<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; Why wouldn&apos;t the Middle/Near easterners have stumbled upon Didymus<br/>&gt; and his<br/>&gt; &gt; explanation of the comma?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; If they did, they didn&apos;t go in that direction -- medieval Arabic<br/>&gt; ratios are steadfastly 3-limit.<br/>&gt;<br/>It may be that the aural differences between different commas only added to<br/>recognition of its importance AS an interval. In this way, a Pythagorean<br/>comma might be a different derivation of the same tiny interval.</p><p>&gt; &gt; Why if they had all the ancient Greek books, or at<br/>&gt; &gt; least the books or fragments we have today, would they need to<br/>&gt; reinvent the<br/>&gt; &gt; wheel on the comma?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I don&apos;t know what you mean &quot;reinvent the wheel on the comma&quot;.

This was not a Greek enterprise<br/>&gt; (who theorized conceptually in tetrachord fourths as Iranians and<br/>&gt; Bulgarians do today).</p><p>To clarify this: Touma says that al-Urmawi&apos;s scale (urmawi.scl in the<br/>Scala list) has its first tetrachord &quot;identical to that of the rast row<br/>used in contemporary Arabian music&quot;.  But he says much the same about<br/>al-Farabi&apos;s 11-limit scale, and the two tetrachords clearly aren&apos;t<br/>identical to each other.  It looks like neither source called their scale<br/>&quot;rast&quot;.</p><p>We&apos;ve really hit the same problem as with Ptolemy&apos;s syntonon diatonic --<br/>although the scale was given at a particular date, we don&apos;t know what its<br/>significance was.  John Chalmers assigns very different tetrachords to all<br/>these writers, and so may have some light to shed.</p><p>Touma also says &quot;some music theorists&quot; describe rast using 53-equal, 9 8 5<br/>9 9 8 5.  In another bit, he mentions 53-equal as being a Syrian thing,<br/>but no names or dates.  And in the next chapter, he gives rast in<br/>24-not-quite-equal as  4 3 3 4 3 3 4 4 3 3 4 3 3 4.  So the tuning of rast<br/>varies across the Arabic world, before you even look at Turkey or Iran.</p><p>Re the Scala archive, is Safi-a-ddin Armavi the same as Safi ad-Din<br/>al-Urmawi?</p><p>                     Graham</p></div><h3>manuel.op.de.coul@eon-benelux.com</h3><span>12/4/2001 4:41:26 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>&gt;Re the Scala archive, is Safi-a-ddin Armavi the same as Safi ad-Din<br/>&gt;al-Urmawi?<br/>Yes, many different transliterations of his name.</p><p>Manuel</p></div><h3>Kraig Grady &#x3C;kraiggrady@anaphoria.com&#x3E;</h3><span>12/4/2001 9:44:03 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Graham and Paul!<br/>OK we can now settle the argument about 24 ET.
