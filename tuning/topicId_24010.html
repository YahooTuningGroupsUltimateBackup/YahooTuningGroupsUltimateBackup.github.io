Here are some reasons why I value pluralism:</p><p>          1. My outlook is modal rather than either &quot;tonal&quot; or<br/>             &quot;atonal/pantonal&quot; -- not to rule out a bit of<br/>             &quot;floating panmodality.&quot; However, I encourage<br/>             others to develop tunings based on tonal or<br/>             pantonal assumptions; there&apos;s room enough for<br/>             all.</p><p>          2. My philosophy of concord/discord is that a<br/>             spectrum of unstable but more or less<br/>             &quot;partial concords&quot; can add great flexibility<br/>             and expressiveness -- but Partchians and<br/>             others are equally free to seek a larger<br/>             set of stable concords, or some other<br/>             ideal.</p><p>          3. As one who favors both Pythagorean and<br/>             mostly Pythagorean-derived JI systems<br/>             involving precise integer ratios, and<br/>             a range of temperaments, I find that<br/>             these approaches have their distinct<br/>             advantages and provide much creative<br/>             variety.</p><p>It seems to me that the most important lesson that the microtonal<br/>community has to share with the &quot;conventional&quot; (and sometimes<br/>not-so-conventional) musical scene -- and many &quot;mainstream&quot; world<br/>cultures would be described as &quot;microtonal&quot; or &quot;xenharmonic&quot; by the<br/>standards of that scene -- is one of intonational pluralism and<br/>enthusiastic celebration of that pluralism.</p><p>This isn&apos;t to oppose a variety of &quot;standards&quot; for large ensembles or<br/>the like, for example 31-tET for meantone-oriented repertory, or maybe<br/>144-tET as one &quot;generalized&quot; scheme. Note that 144-tET has close<br/>approximations of regular Pythagorean intervals such as 81:64 or<br/>~407.82 cents (49/144 is 408.3333... cents); and also the 17-tET major<br/>third at ~423.53 cents (51/144 is 425 cents, very close to 23:18).</p><p>Then, again, gamelan tunings in slendro or pelog (including those<br/>stretched octaves) likely have a much longer history, and seem to me<br/>as appropriate a &quot;microtonal standard&quot; as anything, not to mention the<br/>history of pure-fifth or Pythagorean tuning in China and elsewhere.<br/>From this kind of viewpoint, 20-tET could be taken as one variant on<br/>slendro (a 5-tET approximation) with &quot;fusion&quot; possibilities in<br/>intercultural settings.</p><p>Here I very much support a Darregian view: diversity is our strength,<br/>and stylistic and intonational pluralism a unifying theme in what it<br/>means to be a &quot;microtonalist.&quot; Our inability to agree even on a<br/>definition of &quot;just intonation&quot; reflects this variety of musical<br/>traditions we represent, a variety worthy of affirmation.</p><p>Again, I speak only for myself, coming from a musical experience which<br/>may neither represent, nor be represented by, any &quot;consensus&quot; on this<br/>List, but may point to the diversity of such experiences and the<br/>importance of mutual recognition of this diversity.</p><p>Most respectfully,</p><p>Margo Schulter<br/><a href="mailto:mschulter@value.net">mschulter@value.net</a></p></div><h3><a id=24014 href="#24014">ðŸ”—</a>jpehrson@rcn.com</h3><span>5/30/2001 7:59:10 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In tuning@y..., mschulter &lt;MSCHULTER@V...&gt; wrote:</p><p><a href="/tuning/topicId_24010.html#24010">/tuning/topicId_24010.html#24010</a></p><p>&gt; Hello, there, everyone, and please let me caution that the following<br/>&gt; remarks reflect the views of only one person among the &quot;disunified,<br/>&gt; crazy, and irrelevant assortment&quot; of microtonalists, as we are<br/>&gt; reported to be viewed in the larger musical community.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Speaking at once with artistic ardor and passion, and in peace and<br/>&gt; nonviolence, I would like to urge that we make the most of such an<br/>&gt; image by unabashedly promoting intonational pluralism, and<br/>questioning<br/>&gt; _any_ &quot;New World (Micro)tonal Order&quot; seeking to restrict this<br/>&gt; pluralism, however commendable the motives might be.<br/>&gt;</p><p>Many thanks to Margo Schulter for the kind admonishment that our<br/>selection of a new &quot;World Order&quot; of xenharmonic tunings with 72-tET<br/>might, indeed, be a &quot;limitation&quot; such as it is!</p><p>However, I believe we were not really thinking of limiting<br/>microtonalists as much as proposing a practical system to the vast<br/>number of &quot;traditional performers&quot; like Ted Mook who are looking for<br/>a practical way to play a variety of xenharmonic tunings.</p><p>Such performers ALREADY seem to prefer 72-tET...</p><p>For our OTHER xenharmonic work, and in the xenharmonic community at<br/>large it would be pointless and self-defeating to propose such a<br/>thing... particularly for those more &quot;theoretically&quot; inclined...</p><p>&gt;or maybe 144-tET as one &quot;generalized&quot; scheme.</p><p>I note that Margo Schulter proposes this possible extension of 72-<br/>tET, as has, of course, Dan Stearns...</p><p>Maybe that extra &quot;inflection&quot; would be valuable in certain cases...<br/>but, still, we have the 72-tET base...

My guess is this: on first<br/>&gt; sight-reading, one may skip past subtle intonational marks to get a<br/>&gt; gross idea of the musical line.  On subsequent readings, and especially<br/>&gt; when the sound of multiple instruments in proper intonation starts to<br/>&gt; come into shape, the musician will largely go &quot;off book&quot; and have the<br/>&gt; intonational target memorized.</p><p>I found this interesting, John, because it&apos;s very much the way<br/>my use of HEWM notation (example:  3^-1 7^1 Eb&lt;  representing<br/>the 7th harmonic of &quot;F&quot; in the key of &quot;C&quot;) is intended to operate.<br/>I think of it as working on several different levels:</p><p>The line-and-space staff-notation gives the first general idea<br/>of pitch: the &quot;diatonic&quot;, the nominal letter-name, along with a crude<br/>pitch-height graph.</p><p>The 12-EDO # and b accidental symbols give a bit of further<br/>pitch discrimination, and the simplest EDO level of perception.<br/>This is as far as regular musicians would understand my scores,<br/>without any further microtonal training.</p><p>The ^ and v accidental symbols give the 24-EDO level of perception,<br/>which I&apos;ve always felt is important to preserve because I believe<br/>24-EDO is the most widely known alternate tuning among performing<br/>musicians.</p><p>The + - &lt; and &gt; accidental symbols give the 72-EDO level, which<br/>has been studied and mastered by many musicians, particularly in<br/>Boston and Salzburg, and which is consistent with many JI tunings,<br/>in which I am very interested.</p><p>Adding the ~ accidental symbol gives the 144-EDO level, which is<br/>the finest resolution of EDO that I&apos;ve ever notated in a score<br/>(sections 2, 3, and 5 of _A Noiseless Patient Spider_), and will<br/>probably only use occasionally as needed.</p><p>So each of these can be viewed as a finer level of approximation.</p><p>Then there is the set of prime-and-exponent accidentals, which<br/>are an entirely different world of experience, as pointed out<br/>by Daniel Wolf.  These provide a clear pinpointing of where<br/>the pitches lie in ratio-space, and so give someone familiar<br/>with rational tuning the precise intonation of the pitch, similar<br/>to the way ratios worked for Partch.</p><p>My opinion is that presenting scores and analyses of microtonal<br/>music in a notation that works on this many different levels<br/>gives more avenues for accesibility to those studying that music.<br/>Some will wander in via one of the EDO routes, others will find<br/>the lattice diagrams easier to understand, and probably many<br/>will use both approaches since they are both part of the notation<br/>and in my view complement each other in the goal toward clarity.</p><p>-monz<br/><a href="http://www.monz.org">http://www.monz.org</a><br/>&quot;All roads lead to n^0&quot;</p><p>_________________________________________________________<br/>Do You Yahoo!?<br/>Get your free <a href="https://twitter.com/yahoo">@yahoo</a>.com address at <a href="http://mail.yahoo.com">http://mail.yahoo.com</a></p></div>
