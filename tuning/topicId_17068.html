I plan to simulate what might be similar to quarter comma meantone tuning of several hundred years ago.  I plan to select a 12 (plus 4 &quot;split key&quot;) tone subset of 31 tones equal.  (In my previous message I described the tones selected.)  I would like to hear on my own (stringed) instrument what quarter comma meantone might have sounded like to those people several hundred years ago.  I selected this one tuning from many other tunings that were used back then.<br/>    As I understand much of the tuning of 12 tone (plus &quot;split keys&quot;) keyboards was done, effectively, by &quot;ear.&quot;  Based on this type of information from long ago has anyone more recently compiled a chart of frequencies (Hz) of the tones in quarter comma meantone scale?  If so, I would like to see such a chart so that I could tune my modern instrument to simulate what they heard so long ago.<br/>    ALITA MORRISON</p></div><h3>graham@microtonal.co.uk</h3><span>1/2/2001 3:06:00 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>In-Reply-To: &lt;<a href="mailto:00ba01c074a3$bb461f00$f25763d1@texas.net">00ba01c074a3$bb461f00$f25763d1@texas.net</a>&gt;<br/>Alita Morrison wrote:</p><p>&gt;     As I understand much of the tuning of 12 tone (plus &quot;split keys&quot;)<br/>&gt; keybo=<br/>&gt; ards was done, effectively, by &quot;ear.&quot;  Based on this type of<br/>&gt; information fr=<br/>&gt; om long ago has anyone more recently compiled a chart of frequencies<br/>&gt; (Hz) o=<br/>&gt; f the tones in quarter comma meantone scale?

To convert an interval of n steps in 31 tone<br/>equal temperament into a frequency ratio, do 2^(n/31).  That means the B<br/>above A=440 will be 440*(2^(5/31)) = 492 Hz.  I think that makes it:</p><p>C  261<br/>C# 272.9<br/>D  291.9<br/>Eb 312.1<br/>E  326.4<br/>F  349.0<br/>F# 365.0<br/>G  390.3<br/>G# 408.2<br/>A  436.5<br/>Bb 466.9<br/>B  488.1<br/>C  522</p><p>But don&apos;t take my word for it, find a calculator!</p><p>Strict quarter comma meantone&apos;s a bit more difficult, as would be<br/>predicting the frequencies that would be arrived at through tuning by ear.</p><p>            Graham</p></div><h3>Monz &#x3C;MONZ@JUNO.COM&#x3E;</h3><span>1/2/2001 2:52:17 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Alita Morrison wrote</p><p><a href="http://www.egroups.com/message/tuning/17068">http://www.egroups.com/message/tuning/17068</a></p><p>&gt;<br/>&gt; ... has anyone more recently compiled a chart of frequencies<br/>&gt; (Hz) of the tones in quarter comma meantone scale?
