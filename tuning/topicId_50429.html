One can not just figure out the math of the string length because the person doing the fretting needs to know how to compensate for the bending of strings. Other wise your tuning will not be that acturate. I once made a single moveable fret where i would check the tuning of the open string, then slide the fret up to the pitch i wanted and still afterwards check the open string tuning  just to make sure. The<br/>other thing with this it is best o do on one of the middle strings because width of the string doe effect this so the best you cn do is pick one in the middle.<br/>     Good luthiers know the secrets to correcting this as much as possible but in reality have never found a guitar capable of being that acturate because of thall the variations unles you have a seperate fret for each string. There is a luthier in LA that has done work for Erv Wilson , Rod Poole and others. In the past a stick or templete is given to him with the theoretical fret positions and he &apos;corrects&apos; them. If this is within you range of possibility contact offline. Otherwse i know John<br/>Schneider has a guitar where each fret is adjustable and he seems happy with this instrument.</p><p>&gt;<br/>&gt;    From: Jay Rinkel &lt;<a href="mailto:jrinkel@hiwaay.net">jrinkel@hiwaay.net</a>&gt;<br/>&gt; Subject: Re:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; On Saturday 27 December 2003 11:07 am, Max wrote:<br/>&gt; &gt; [snip]<br/>&gt; &gt; You could supply that information to them.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; If L stands for the scale length, and F for the frequency of the<br/>&gt; &gt; desired note (open string = 1, octave = 2, etc.), the corresponding<br/>&gt; &gt; fret would be<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; L*(F-1)/F<br/>&gt; &gt; [snip]<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Yeah, the math is not a problem for me -- just making sure I find people who<br/>&gt; can do the actual guitar work.

You have more patience then myself.  I have<br/>also listened to the MP3 files available -- your JI guitar does sound quite<br/>nice.  As for the compensation of the string bending -- this is a concern of<br/>mine, and I have had various thoughts on this.  John Starret seems to think<br/>that using the &quot;fret math&quot; will be close enough.  I did this with my JI<br/>dulcimer.  The dulcimer maker claimed he didn&apos;t do any string compensation<br/>when placing frets.  (I have checked his 12eq fretting with an electronic<br/>tuner and they seem to stay very close for most of the fretboard)  I gave him<br/>the measurements and it seems to sound very fine.  I have also rationalized<br/>that if the compensation is good enough for 12eq guitar (ok, maybe this is a<br/>BAD rationalization) than it should be good enough for 19eq, 22eq, or<br/>lucyscale..  Nevertheless, I will soak in the comments made here about<br/>whether the straight math is good enough and go from there.</p><p>By the way, I&apos;m not too much of a handyman myself so I hesitate to do any of<br/>this guitar work myself.</p><p>Jay</p></div><h3><a id=50502 href="#50502">ðŸ”—</a>Kurt Bigler &#x3C;kkb@breathsense.com&#x3E;</h3><span>12/27/2003 2:04:19 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>on 12/27/03 10:13 AM, Jay Rinkel &lt;<a href="mailto:jrinkel@hiwaay.net">jrinkel@hiwaay.net</a>&gt; wrote:</p><p>&gt; On Saturday 27 December 2003 11:07 am, Max wrote:<br/>&gt;&gt; [snip]<br/>&gt;&gt; You could supply that information to them.<br/>&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt; If L stands for the scale length, and F for the frequency of the<br/>&gt;&gt; desired note (open string = 1, octave = 2, etc.), the corresponding<br/>&gt;&gt; fret would be<br/>&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt; L*(F-1)/F<br/>&gt;&gt; [snip]<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Yeah, the math is not a problem for me -- just making sure I find people who<br/>&gt; can do the actual guitar work.
