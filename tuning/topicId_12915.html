This is also a feature of &quot;neo-Gothic&quot;<br/>temperaments in the most characteristic range between Pythagorean and<br/>17-tET, with fifths somewhat wider than pure.</p><p>Pythagorean major and minor thirds at the large integer ratios of 81:64<br/>(407 cents) and 32:27 (294 cents), and also neo-Gothic thirds at or near<br/>14:11 (417 cents) and 13:11 (289 cents), are prized for their complex and<br/>active quality.[1] They often serve as points of directed tension or<br/>instability, resolving to stable 3-limit sonorities with pure or near-pure<br/>fifths and fourths.</p><p>Since for many modern readers, as opposed to medieval or neo-Gothic<br/>theorists, an integer ratio may imply an interval simple enough to be tuned<br/>by ear through a &quot;locking-in&quot; of the partials, we emphasize that no such<br/>implications necessarily attach to the larger integer ratios mentioned in<br/>this paper.[2]</p><p>In a dialogue on the role of these intervals in Gothic and neo-Gothic<br/>music, we were both intrigued by the concept that they may draw their<br/>appeal precisely from their complexity.</p><p>We conceive of major thirds in regular tunings between Pythagorean and<br/>17-tET as located on a gently rounded plateau region between the notch-like<br/>valleys of 5:4 and 9:7. Minor thirds are likewise situated on a plateau of<br/>complexity between the simpler 7:6 and 6:5.</p><p>The central portions of such plateaux might be called regions of<br/>maximal &quot;harmonic entropy&quot; (Paul Erlich)[3] or &quot;sensory dissonance&quot;<br/>(William Sethares)[4] or &quot;complexity&quot; [M.S.].[5]</p><p>Even while we were engaged in an absorbing dialogue on these plateau<br/>regions and their mathematical and musical nature, Keenan Pepper, in a<br/>delightful synchronicity, posted an article to the Tuning List[6] on the<br/>application of the Golden Ratio or Phi to another area of music: the<br/>generation of scales with particular relationships between scale steps.</p><p>One of us recognized that Pepper&apos;s Phi-related function could also be<br/>applied to the problem of finding the region of maximum complexity<br/>between two simpler ratios, providing a shortcut to the longer process<br/>of successive approximation by iterating mediants.</p><p>In what follows, we show how this function, here termed the &quot;Golden<br/>Mediant&quot;, can be used to locate regions of maximum complexity.</p><p>Section 1 presents the classic mediant function, and Section 2 the process<br/>of finding closer and closer approximations to such regions of maximum<br/>complexity.</p><p>Section 3 shows how the Golden Mediant can simplify this process, yielding<br/>results in general agreement with the local maxima of Paul Erlich&apos;s<br/>harmonic entropy or William Sethares&apos; sensory dissonance. Both of these<br/>must be calculated using complicated computer algorithms and do not admit<br/>of a simple closed-form expression like the Golden Mediant.</p><p>Section 4 briefly considers the classic mediant and Golden Mediant in<br/>relation to the tuning of certain common unstable intervals along the most<br/>characteristic portion of the neo-Gothic spectrum from Pythagorean to<br/>17-tone equal temperament (17-tET).</p><p>While our perspectives may somewhat differ, we strongly agree that the<br/>Golden Mediant provides new cardinal points of orientation in exploring the<br/>subtle shadings of neo-Gothic intervals and tunings.</p><p>At the same time, we emphasize that the problem of locating plateau regions<br/>may be of interest for various musics, and that we welcome the application<br/>of the concepts here described, to a variety of styles.</p><p>---------------------------------------------------<br/>1. The classic mediant and plateaux of complexity<br/>---------------------------------------------------</p><p>In locating a region of complexity between two simpler ratios such as 5:4<br/>and 9:7, one useful index is the _mediant_ of the two ratios. For any two<br/>ratios i:j and m:n, this mediant is defined as the sum of the two<br/>numerators over the sum of the two denominators:</p><p>                               (i + m)<br/>                               -------<br/>                               (j + n)</p><p>To illustrate this mediant formula, let us apply it to 5:4 and 9:7, finding<br/>a size of major third which may be close to the central plateau region of<br/>equal remoteness from both valleys:</p><p>                               (5 + 9)<br/>                               -------<br/>                               (4 + 7)</p><p>This value, as it happens, is identical with the favored 14:11 ratio for a<br/>major third in neo-Gothic theory, giving this ratio a new mathematical<br/>significance fitting its intriguing musical qualities of instability and<br/>complexity in Gothic or neo-Gothic styles. This mediant is very closely<br/>approximated, for example, by 46-tET.</p><p>Finding the mediant of 6:5 and 7:6, two simple ratios or valleys for minor<br/>thirds, gives a similar meaning to another favored neo-Gothic ratio:</p><p>                               (6 + 7)<br/>                               -------<br/>                               (5 + 6)</p><p>This mediant is identical to the neo-Gothic 13:11, closely approximated for<br/>example by 29-tET, a leading neo-Gothic tuning.</p><p>If we wish to make these mediant relationships of complexity explicit, or<br/>avoid the assumption that these are to be considered as relative<br/>_consonances_ of say an 11-limit or 13-limit just intonation, we can leave<br/>14:11 written as (5+9):(4+7), and likewise 13:11 as (6+7):(5+6).</p><p>Here we shall refer to this mediant of (i+m):(j+n) as the &quot;classic mediant&quot;<br/>to distinguish it from the Phi-based &quot;Golden Mediant&quot; we shall describe<br/>below.</p><p>-----------------------------------------------<br/>2. Refining our estimates: the Fibonacci series<br/>-----------------------------------------------</p><p>&gt;From one viewpoint, the point of maximum complexity between two simple<br/>interval ratios is like the highest point of a gently rounded plateau<br/>between valleys, a familiar metaphor in relation to Paul Erlich&apos;s and<br/>William Sethares&apos; studies and charts.</p><p>From another viewpoint, it might be compared to the point of equal<br/>gravitational attraction between two planets or planetlike bodies such as<br/>the Earth and Moon.</p><p>If an object were placed at such a point, a physicist would say it was<br/>in a _metastable_ state. This is understood to be a special kind of<br/>_un_stable state, one which may persist for a very long time, but not<br/>forever, since the slightest perturbation of the object will see it<br/>eventually tumble all the way to one side or the other. We think the<br/>term metastable may also be descriptive of the quality of the<br/>corresponding musical intervals.</p><p>The planetary metaphor suggests a refinement in our process of<br/>approximating the point of metastability. Since the Earth is larger than<br/>the Moon, and exerts a greater gravitational attraction, we find that the<br/>point of equal attraction is actually located somewhat closer to the Moon<br/>than to the Earth, roughly at about 3/4 of the way from the Earth to the<br/>Moon.</p><p>Similarly, while both 4:3 and 5:4 are simple or &quot;planetlike&quot; ratios, the<br/>4:3 has a greater degree of simplicity or attraction, so that we might<br/>expect the point of maximum complexity or ambiguity to be somewhat closer<br/>to 5:4. The classic mediant already gives us this result to some degree.<br/>(4+5):(3+4) (or 9:7) is indeed closer to 5:4 than to 4:3.</p><p>However, in this case we find that 9:7 is itself simple enough to be a weak<br/>attractor and greater complexity can be obtained by taking the mediant of<br/>9:7 with the less simple of its predecessors, giving (5+9):(4+7).</p><p>This is the complex major third known in neo-Gothic theory as the<br/>14:11, at around 417.5 cents. It is instructive to note that this<br/>interval is about 31 cents wider than 5:4 (386.3 cents), and about 18<br/>cents narrower than 9:7 (435.1 cents). This position of the classic<br/>mediant somewhat closer to the less simple 9:7 fits our intuitive<br/>expectation that the region of rough gravitational equality should be<br/>closer to the less powerful attractor or &quot;planet.&quot;</p><p>One might feel justified in stopping when the resulting ratio is too<br/>complex to be considered an attractor, but if we want the _most_ complex<br/>ratio we think the process should be continued.</p><p>The mediant of 9:7 and 14:11, is known in neo-Gothic theory as 23:18, and<br/>is located around 424.4 cents, or about 38 cents from 5:4 and 11 cents from<br/>9:7. The major third of 17-tET, at 423.5 cents, is quite close to this<br/>intermediate ratio.</p><p>As we progress through the successive mediants, our approximations<br/>gradually converge toward a limit about which they oscillate more and more<br/>closely. At this stage we will drop the 4:3 and consider the series to have<br/>begun with the last two attractors to appear, 5:4 and 9:7, and we look at<br/>the pattern of successive mediants.</p><p>----------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>      Mediant        Ratio      Cents    Dist from: 5:4      9:7<br/>----------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>    (5+9):(4+7)      14:11      417.5             +31.2    -17.6<br/>   (9+14):(7+11)     23:18      424.4             +38.1    -10.7<br/>  (14+23):(11+18)    37:29      421.8             +35.5    -13.3<br/>  (23+37):(18+29)    60:47      422.8             +36.4    -12.3<br/>  (37+60):(29+47)    97:76      422.4             +36.1    -12.7<br/>  (60+97):(47+76)   157:123     422.53            +36.21   -12.55<br/> (97+157):(76+123)  254:199     422.47            +36.15   -12.61<br/>                             .   .   .   .   .<br/>----------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p>Curiously, as it happens, the region between 5:4 and 9:7 seems to resemble<br/>the Earth-Moon system in that the point of gravitational parity appears to<br/>be situated about 3/4 of the way (in a logarithmic sense) from the more<br/>powerful to the less powerful attractor.</p><p>As we progress through this series of approximations, our values for this<br/>central plateau region of maximal complexity approach convergence at around<br/>422.5 cents, or about 1 cent narrower than the 17-tET major third.</p><p>If the sides of the ratios are considered separately, each may be seen to<br/>be a series of integers where every number after the second is the sum of<br/>the preceding two numbers. We say they are Fibonacci-like.</p><p>Originally designed as a model for the reproduction of rabbits, the<br/>Fibonacci series begins with the first two numbers 1, 1 -- each new member<br/>of the series then being equal to the sum of the previous two members:</p><p>1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89, 144, 233, 377 ...</p><p>This famous number series was interestingly described by Leonard Fibonacci<br/>of Pisa around 1200, the same era in which the composer Perotin and his<br/>colleagues made composition for three and four voices a regular practice.<br/>In his _Liber Abaci_, Fibonacci also introduced the decimal system of<br/>Arabic numerals to Gothic Europe.</p><p>To apply this famous series to our problem of finding the region of maximum<br/>complexity or gravitational balance between two simpler intervals, we begin<br/>with a &quot;weighted&quot; version of the formula for the classic mediant (Section<br/>1.1), where i:j is the simpler ratio and m:n the less simple ratio or less<br/>strong &quot;attractor&quot;:</p><p>                           (xi + ym)<br/>                           ---------<br/>                           (xj + yn)</p><p>Here x and y are weights for the two ratios, with the second or &quot;y&quot; term<br/>being applied to the _less simple_ ratio.</p><p>We show what happens when the weights are chosen to be successive members<br/>of the Fibonacci series. This will be easier to understand if we apply it<br/>to our problem of the zone of gravitational parity between 5:4 and 9:7,<br/>stepping through the first few approximations near the beginning of the<br/>Fibonacci series.</p><p>Our first two Fibonacci numbers are 1, 1, so that x=1 and y=1. This gives a<br/>result identical to the classic mediant:</p><p>                   (1*5 + 1*9)   (5 + 9)<br/>                   ----------- = ------- = 14:11<br/>                   (1*4 + 1*7)   (4 + 7)</p><p>Our next pair of Fibonacci numbers is 1, 2, giving us x=1, y=2. Note that<br/>the larger value for y gives the less simple ratio more &quot;weight,&quot; bringing<br/>our estimate of the point of maximum complexity somewhat closer to 9:7.</p><p>                   (1*5 + 2*9)   (5 + 18)<br/>                   ----------- = -------- = 23:18<br/>                   (1*4 + 2*7)   (4 + 14)</p><p>Our next Fibonacci pair of 2, 3 gives us x=2, y=3:</p><p>                   (2*5 + 3*9)   (10 + 27)<br/>                   ----------- = --------- = 37:29<br/>                   (2*4 + 3*7)    (8 + 21)</p><p>As we progress through the successive Fibonacci pairs for our weights<br/>x and y, we reproduce exactly the same successive approximations as<br/>obtained above by iterating the mediant.</p><p>If we apply the same series of Fibonacci weights to the 6:5 (315.6 cents)<br/>and 7:6 (266.9 cents), the 6:5 having the more powerful gravitational<br/>attraction (or being situated in a deeper &quot;valley&quot;), we get these results,<br/>starting with the classic mediant (6+7:5+6) where x=1, y=1:</p><p>----------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>Fibonacci weights  Wtd mediant     Cents    Dist from: 6:5       7:6<br/>----------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>   x=1,  y=1      (6+7):(5+6)     289.2              -26.4     +22.3<br/>   x=1,  y=2     (6+14):(5+12)    281.4              -34.3     +14.5<br/>   x=2,  y=3    (12+21):(10+18)   284.4              -31.2     +17.6<br/>   x=3,  y=5    (18+35):(15+30)   283.3              -32.4     +16.4<br/>   x=5,  y=8    (30+56):(25+48)   283.7              -31.9     +16.9<br/>   x=8, y=13    (48+91):(40+78)   283.56             -32.08    +16.69<br/>  x=13, y=21   (78+147):(65+126)  283.62             -32.02    +16.75<br/>                             .   .   .   .   .<br/>----------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p>Here the terms appear to be converging on a region around 283.6 cents, or<br/>roughly 2/3 of the way from the wider 6:5 to the narrower 7:6. The central<br/>plateau of maximum complexity or gravitational parity is again closer to<br/>the shallower valley, or the planet with the less powerful attraction. On<br/>the spectrum of regular neo-Gothic tunings, this region of maximal<br/>complexity for the minor third is located between 46-tET (287.0 cents) and<br/>17-tET (282.4 cents).</p><p>------------------------------------------------<br/>3. A new index of complexity: the Golden Mediant<br/>------------------------------------------------</p><p>As we have seen, the Fibonacci series of values for x and y beginning with<br/>the classic mediant (x=1, y=1) offers us closer and closer approximations<br/>converging on a limit which may indicate the region of maximal complexity<br/>between two simpler intervals.</p><p>We can simplify the process by directly finding this limit itself, here<br/>termed the &quot;Golden Mediant,&quot; using a function like that applied to the<br/>different area of scale generation by Keenan Pepper (see note 4).</p><p>As terms of the Fibonacci series grow larger and larger, the ratio between<br/>any two successive terms converges on a value known as Phi, or the Golden<br/>Ratio. Phi has the property:</p><p>                 1<br/>               ----- = Phi - 1   or   Phi^2 - Phi = 1<br/>                Phi</p><p>As a solution of the above quadratic one finds that Phi is (sqrt(5)+1)/2 or<br/>approximately 1.61803398874989484820459.</p><p>Thus we can find the Golden Mediant for the region of maximum complexity<br/>between two simpler intervals by setting x=1, y=Phi. For two such interval<br/>ratios i:j and m:n where i:j is the simpler ratio:</p><p>                                        (i + Phi * m)<br/>         GoldenMediant(i/j, m/n)    =   -------------<br/>                                        (j + Phi * n)</p><p>Interestingly, Phi itself occurs as the ratio of greatest complexity<br/>between the major and minor sixths 5:3 and 8:5 (or between 8:5 and 13:8).</p><p>For a maximally complex major third between 5:4 and 9:7, or a maximally<br/>complex minor third between 6:5 and 7:6, our new Phi-based function yields<br/>these results:</p><p>----------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>Intervals        Golden Mediant        Cents   Dist from: i:j     m:n<br/>i:j  m:n    (i + m Phi):(j + n Phi)<br/>----------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>5:4  9:7    (5 + 9 Phi):(4 + 7 Phi)   422.5              +36.2  -12.6<br/>----------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>6:5  7:6    (6 + 7 Phi):(5 + 6 Phi)   283.6              -32.0  +16.7<br/>----------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p>It is interesting to compare these results, and some others of relevance to<br/>neo-Gothic music, with Paul Erlich&apos;s values to the nearest cent for the<br/>regions of &quot;maximum entropy&quot; or complexity between these interval pairs:</p><p>----------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>Intervals    Measure          Cents    Dist from:  i:j       m:n<br/>i:j  m:n<br/>----------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>5:4  9:7    classic mediant   417.5               +31.2     -17.6<br/>            Golden Mediant    422.5               +36.2     -12.6<br/>            Erlich            423                 +37       -12<br/>----------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>6:5  7:6    classic mediant   289.2               -26.4     +22.3<br/>            Golden Mediant    283.6               -32.0     +16.7<br/>            Erlich            285                 -31       +18<br/>----------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>5:3 12:7    classic mediant   918.6               +34.3     -14.5<br/>            Golden Mediant    923.0               +38.7     -10.1<br/>            Erlich            924                 +40        -9<br/>----------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>7:4  9:5    classic mediant   996.1               +27.3     -21.5<br/>            Golden Mediant   1001.6               +32.8     -16.0<br/>            Erlich            999                 +30       -19<br/>----------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>5:4  6:5    classic mediant   347.5               -38.9     +31.8<br/>            Golden Mediant    339.3               -47.0     +23.7<br/>            Erlich            348                 -38       +32<br/>----------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>9:7  4:3    classic mediant   454.2               -43.8     +19.1<br/>            Golden mediant    448.5               -49.6     +13.4<br/>            Erlich            457                 -41       +22<br/>----------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p>For the first three pairs of &quot;valley&quot; or &quot;planet&quot; intervals, separated by<br/>the ratio of 36:35 (5:4-9:7; 6:5-7:6; 5:3-12:7), the Golden Mediant and the<br/>maxima of Erlich&apos;s harmonic entropy coincide within 1-2 cents.</p><p>For the similar pair 7:4-9:5, they differ by about 3 cents, with Erlich&apos;s<br/>point of maximum entropy about midway between the classic mediant (the<br/>Pythagorean minor seventh at 16:9) and the Golden Mediant.</p><p>For the pair 5:4-6:5, where a zone of maximum complexity or &quot;ambiguity&quot;<br/>might be expected to fall around the 11:9 &quot;neutral third&quot; (the classic<br/>mediant), Erlich&apos;s 348 cents virtually coincides with this mediant, while<br/>the Golden Mediant at 339.3 cents is decidedly closer to the less simple<br/>6:5 ratio.</p><p>For the pair 9:7-4:3, where 13:10 is the classic mediant, in an area of<br/>complexity or ambiguity where large major thirds begin to shade toward<br/>narrow fourths, the Golden Mediant leans more toward the less simple 9:7,<br/>while Erlich&apos;s 457 cents leans more toward the fourth.</p><p>Intonationally complex intervals of all these varieties may occur in<br/>neo-Gothic styles. The regular thirds and sixths, as in historical Gothic<br/>music, play vital cadential and coloristic roles in various unstable<br/>sonorities. Minor sevenths at or near 16:9, conceived of not as especially<br/>&quot;complex&quot; intervals but rather as comparatively simple ones derived from<br/>two pure or near-pure 4:3 fourths, may play similar roles.</p><p>The two remaining interval types are less conventional &quot;special<br/>effects&quot; categories. Regular neo-Gothic tunings in the range from<br/>around 29-tET to 17-tET feature diminished fourths or alternative<br/>major thirds (372.4-352.9 cents) and augmented seconds or alternative<br/>minor thirds (331.0-352.9 cents) offering various intermediate<br/>shadings converging on the &quot;neutral third&quot; of 17-tET.</p><p>In 29-tET, the interval of the &quot;wide major third&quot; at 11/29 octave,<br/>455.2 cents, is also a &quot;special effects&quot; interval in the zone of<br/>ambiguity where such thirds approach the region of narrow fourths;<br/>this interval is close to the classic mediant or Erlich&apos;s &quot;entropy&quot;<br/>maximum.</p><p>In addition to providing these comparisons and inviting readers to perform<br/>their own listening tests, we suggest that Erlich&apos;s algorithm might<br/>usefully be modified to use the Golden Mediant where it currently uses the<br/>classic mediant or his more recent &quot;limit-weighted midpoint&quot;. Of course,<br/>having put Golden Mediants into the algorithm, we should not then be<br/>surprised if we obtain Golden Mediants out of it.</p><p>In the case of Sethares&apos; algorithm we find that the position of the<br/>local maxima are too dependent on the parameters of the model to<br/>permit any detailed comparison. In particular, one can (and must)<br/>specify the timbre being used. Our use of the Golden Mediant (which is<br/>a rule-of-thumb rather than a model) is intended to apply only to<br/>&quot;typical&quot; harmonic timbres. In such cases we expect we would be in<br/>general agreement with Sethares.</p><p>-----------------------------------------------------<br/>4. Shadings of complexity and the neo-Gothic spectrum<br/>-----------------------------------------------------</p><p>Both the historical Gothic music of Europe based on a pure Pythagorean<br/>tuning, and also neo-Gothic temperaments in the most characteristic<br/>range of Pythagorean to 17-tET, feature fifths at or reasonably close<br/>to pure, and complex thirds and sixths. As the historian Carl Dahlhaus<br/>has written, such complexity in a Gothic setting fits the role of<br/>thirds and sixths with their &quot;factor of instability.&quot;[7]</p><p>Using the classic mediant and Golden Mediant together with Erlich&apos;s values<br/>for regions of maximum entropy, we can briefly survey the subtle shadings<br/>of complexity along the spectrum from Pythagorean to 17-tET. Here we sample<br/>three categories of unstable intervals: major and minor thirds, and major<br/>sixths.</p><p>---------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>Interval                 Classic Mediant    Golden Mediant    Erlich<br/>---------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>M3 (5:4-9:7)                417.5               422.5          423<br/>.....................................................................<br/>Pythagorean    407.8        - 9.7               -14.7          -15<br/>29-tET         413.8        - 3.7               - 8.7          - 9<br/>46-tET         417.4        - 0.1               - 5.1          - 6<br/>17-tET         423.5        + 6.0               + 1.0            0.5<br/>---------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>m3 (6:5-7:6)                289.2               283.6          285<br/>.....................................................................<br/>Pythagorean    294.1        + 4.9               +10.9          + 9<br/>29-tET         289.7        + 0.4               + 6.4          + 5<br/>46-tET         287.0        - 2.3               + 3.7          + 2<br/>17-tET         282.4        - 6.9               - 0.9          - 3<br/>---------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>M6 (5:3-12:7)               918.6               923.0          924<br/>.....................................................................<br/>Pythagorean    905.9        -12.8               -17.2          -18<br/>29-tET         910.3        - 8.3               -12.7          -14<br/>46-tET         913.0        - 5.6               -10.0           -9<br/>17-tET         917.6        - 1.0               - 5.4           -6<br/>---------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p>For the major and minor thirds, Pythagorean intervals are located on the<br/>portion of a plateau with a shading somewhat closer to that of the simpler<br/>or more strongly attracting &quot;valley&quot; or &quot;planet&quot;: the 5:4 or 6:5 rather<br/>than the 9:7 or 7:6.</p><p>In the especially characteristic portion of the neo-Gothic range from<br/>around 29-tET to slightly beyond 46-tET, these intervals are at or near<br/>their classic mediant values, (9+5):(7+4) and (6+7):(5+6), the celebrated<br/>14:11 and 13:11 of neo-Gothic theory.</p><p>Around 17-tET, these intervals approach the point of maximum complexity as<br/>defined either by the Golden Mediant or by Erlich&apos;s statistical model.</p><p>For major sixths, we remain on the portion of the plateau somewhat closer<br/>to 5:3 than the classic mediant until around 17-tET, and to reach the<br/>Golden Mediant or Erlich&apos;s region of maximal entropy, we would need to<br/>temper the fifth by  5.7 cents. This is almost exactly the fifth of 39-tET<br/>(707.7 cents), a tuning in what is termed the &quot;far neo-Gothic&quot; zone beyond<br/>the characteristic range of Pythagorean to 17-tET.</p><p>Fine distinctions of shading within a plateau region may be reflected in<br/>descriptions of 29-tET as &quot;gentle,&quot; and tunings around 46-tET also as<br/>&quot;mild&quot; in comparison to the &quot;stronger&quot; or more &quot;avant-garde&quot; 17-tET.[8]</p><p>Since major and minor thirds in 29-tET or 46-tET are close to the classic<br/>mediants, while 17-tET thirds closely approximate the Golden Mediants or<br/>Erlich&apos;s regions of maximal entropy, it would appear that the choice<br/>between shades of complexity is a matter of musical discretion and taste.</p><p>-----<br/>Notes<br/>-----</p><p>1. In the interests of familiarity, D.K. has agreed to use, in this paper,<br/>the convention of placing the larger number first in ratios for musical<br/>intervals, despite his objections as outlined in<br/><a href="http://dkeenan.com/Music/ANoteOnNotation.htm">http://dkeenan.com/Music/ANoteOnNotation.htm</a>.</p><p>2. On the basis of experiment, D.K. asserts that, under ordinary<br/>conditions, 14:11 and 13:11, and likewise the Pythagorean 81:64 and 32:27,<br/>are not directly recognizable or tuneable by ear, any more than are<br/>tempered intervals at nearby locations on the continuum. This is in<br/>contrast to simpler ratios such as 5:4, 6:5, 9:7 and 7:6, and possibly such<br/>as 11:7 and 11:8.</p><p>3. See, for example, <a href="http://www.ixpres.com/interval/td/entropy.htm">http://www.ixpres.com/interval/td/entropy.htm</a>,<br/>including a table of &quot;entropy maxima&quot; quoted in this article. Erlich&apos;s<br/>model proposes that there is a kind of probability curve that a<br/>listener&apos;s auditory system will perceive any given interval as fitting<br/>one of a set of more or less simple integer ratios. Thus in the<br/>historical meantone range near 4:5, a major third is very likely to be<br/>perceived as this ratio; around 7:9, as in some of Erlich&apos;s music<br/>based on 22-tET, recognition is also likely, although this is a<br/>shallower &quot;valley,&quot; or less strongly attractive &quot;planet.&quot; On the<br/>neo-Gothic plateau between these valleys or planets, such<br/>identifications would seem very problematic, giving major thirds a<br/>complex and intriguing quality.</p><p>4. William Sethares, _Relating Timbre and Tuning_,<br/><a href="http://eceserv0.ece.wisc.edu/~sethares/consemi.html">http://eceserv0.ece.wisc.edu/~sethares/consemi.html</a></p><p>5. The term complexity is used in this paper to mean both (a) the<br/>complexity of the ratio as given (e.g.) by the product of its two<br/>sides when in lowest terms, and (b) the way an interval sounds to<br/>us. We must point out that these do not always correspond, as Paul<br/>Erlich&apos;s example of 3001:2001 makes clear.</p><p>6. Keenan Pepper, &quot;The Other Noble Fifth,&quot; Tuning Digest [TD] 794:8,<br/>10 September 2000.</p><p>7. Carl Dahlhaus, _Studies on the Origin of Harmonic Tonality_ (trans.<br/>Robert O. Gjerdingen), Princeton: Princeton University Press, 1990, p. 187.<br/>Dahlhaus specifically mentions &quot;the complicated Pythagorean proportions<br/>64:81 and 27:32&quot; for major and minor thirds, emphasizing that this tuning<br/>&quot;should ... be understood as a musical phenomenon rather than as a<br/>mathematically motivated acoustical defect,&quot; ibid. p. 188.</p><p>8. This subjective contrast may reflect not only the tuning of regular<br/>intervals, but the differing qualities of diminished fourths and augmented<br/>seconds. In the more &quot;avant-garde&quot; 17-tET, these are identical neutral<br/>thirds, with cadential resolutions differing radically from a usual Gothic<br/>flavor; the spectrum of intermediate thirds from around 29-tET to 46-tET<br/>may involve a less dramatic contrast with other elements of intonation and<br/>style.</p></div>
