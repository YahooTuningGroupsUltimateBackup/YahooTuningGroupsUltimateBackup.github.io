Much in doubt on this point when I wrote, I attempted<br/>quickly to canvass a few possible sources -- not then having your<br/>article at hand. Unfortunately, I followed a source giving what would<br/>prove to be the less orthodox orthography, a mistake promptly revealed<br/>the next day when I revisited the library and again checked your<br/>article. Neither did my foible go unnoticed in this forum, where it<br/>was not unprecedented.</p><p>To draw some redeeming value from my misadventure, I might wonder<br/>whether this potential ambiguity of spelling could resemble that I<br/>noted in Florio&apos;s Italian-English dictionary of 1611, with either<br/>_manera_ or _maniera_ as a form of the word meaning &quot;manner&quot; or<br/>&quot;style.&quot;</p><p>However spelled, this happy word may express the greatness both of a<br/>composer such as Vicentino or Gesualdo, and of Joe Maneri as one<br/>boldly exploring a new musical universe and manner of expression.</p><p>-----------------------------------<br/>1. &quot;Adding Pitches&quot; -- one overview<br/>-----------------------------------</p><p>Repeating my concern that any first impressions here should facilitate<br/>but not constrain the free give and take of our conversation, I might<br/>speak of three main themes that your PNM article &quot;Adding Pitches&quot;<br/>sounds for me.</p><p>The first is an enriching counterpoint to my own musical practice,<br/>which I will discuss in this article.</p><p>The second is an invitation for me, as someone who makes music with an<br/>assortment of just intonation systems and tempered systems, to<br/>distinguish this practice and theory from &quot;rules&quot; of &quot;pure tuning&quot;<br/>which might exclude most of my favorite JI tunings as yet more<br/>&quot;dissonant&quot; or &quot;out of tune&quot; than 12-tone equal temperament. Your<br/>eloquent praise for certain JI compositions celebrates prime musical<br/>values toward which I also strive: complex ratios, and novel types of<br/>intervals both vertical and melodic.</p><p>The third is an opportunity for an open exploration of what I might<br/>call &quot;stylized tuning&quot; -- the way that 72-tone equal temperament, as<br/>you discuss and celebrate, so satisfyingly fits your musical<br/>worldview, while I am enchanted by systems with fifths impure by about<br/>the same amount, but in the wide direction. It feels almost like an<br/>alternative history novel, each road having its own compelling logic<br/>and grace.</p><p>--------------------------------------------<br/>2. Adding pitches -- a generalized approach?<br/>--------------------------------------------</p><p>In your article, you show how the basic tuning of 12-note equal<br/>temperament (12-tET) can serve as the starting point for a process of<br/>&quot;adding pitches&quot; to build complex microtonal systems such as 24-tET,<br/>36-tET, 48-tET, and 72-tET.</p><p>Here I am tempted to suggest that my own approach to music seems to<br/>involve a parallel process in which a 12-note tuning based on a<br/>regular chain of fifths -- typically either pure (Pythagorean JI) or<br/>gently wider than pure -- serves as a basis for &quot;adding pitches&quot; to<br/>arrive at a larger system of 17 or 24 notes per octave.</p><p>Your article, of course, focuses on this process as applied to a<br/>&quot;microtonal equal temperament,&quot; and more specifically to what I might<br/>term in shorthand as &quot;6n/12n-tET&quot; -- that is, equally tempered systems<br/>with a number of notes evenly divisible by 6 or 12.</p><p>However, many elements of this paradigm -- with curious variations --<br/>could also apply to many of my most characteristic tuning systems for<br/>what I term &quot;neo-Gothic&quot; or &quot;neo-medieval&quot; music largely based on the<br/>13th-14th century styles of Gothic Europe, with some influences also<br/>from the medieval Near East.</p><p>To illustrate some of these parallels and variations, I have chosen a<br/>regular but unequal as well as impure 24-note tuning based on a chain<br/>of fifths at about 704.61 cents, or about 2.65 cents wide. As<br/>mentioned above, these fifths are about as impure as the 700-cent<br/>fifths of 12-tET and its extensions such as 72-tET (about 1.95 cents<br/>narrow) -- actually a bit more impure -- but in the opposite<br/>direction.</p><p>My choice to begin with an _impure_ 24-note system might be taken as<br/>an exercise of a bit of prudent diplomacy: a 24-note system based on<br/>Pythagorean tuning would take us into the realm of just intonation,<br/>the not unexciting topic for my next post.</p><p>For now, it might suffice to add that these 24-note JI systems<br/>(Pythagorean-based, pure fifths) and tempered systems (wide fifths)<br/>typically share many of the same types of intervals, and support many<br/>of the same Gothic or neo-medieval patterns and progressions. In this<br/>musical environment, the &quot;just/tempered&quot; distinction can seem more of<br/>a nuance than a gaping dichotomy.</p><p>In a Pythagorean-based JI system, as we shall see in my next article,<br/>the &quot;user interface&quot; at the keyboard would be much like that we are<br/>about to encounter: two 12-note manuals, each arranged in a regular<br/>chain of fifths. As a medievalist, on such a keyboard I feel cozily at<br/>home -- much as another musician might feel in 12-tET, also based on<br/>such a regular chain, albeit with some important differences.</p><p>Before &quot;adding pitches&quot; to build a 24-note system, let us take a look<br/>at our basic 12-note temperament, a familiar musical space in a<br/>neo-medieval setting, just as 12-tET is in many other settings. Here<br/>I show intervals in rounded cents:</p><p>      132     286               628      837     991<br/>       C#      Eb                F#       G#     Bb<br/> C          D          E    F        G        A        B   C<br/> 0         209        418  495      705      914     1123 1200<br/>      209        209     77     209     209      209     77</p><p>From a melodic point of view, this temperament has whole-tones<br/>(e.g. C-D, Eb-F) at about 209.21 cents, a bit larger than 12-tET, and<br/>diatonic semitones (e.g. E-F, A-Bb, C#-D) at about 76.97 cents --<br/>considerably narrower and more compact than the 100 cents of 12-tET.</p><p>Additionally, there is a dramatic contrast between these narrow<br/>diatonic semitones and the wide chromatic semitones (e.g. C-C#, Eb-E)<br/>at around 132.25 cents -- a difference of no less than 55 cents,<br/>greater than the 50-cent quartertone of 24-tET and its subdivisions.</p><p>This disparity of semitone sizes invites striking forms of<br/>chromaticism, for example those illustrated and advocated by<br/>Marchettus of Padua in his _Lucidarium_ of 1318, while opening the way<br/>in a 24-note extension of this tuning for captivating patterns of<br/>metachromaticism or &quot;ultrachromaticism&quot; -- the latter term gratefully<br/>borrowed from your &quot;Adding Pitches&quot; in PNM, where you discuss its use<br/>by Ivan Wyschnegradsky</p><p>Vertically, as is characteristic of Gothic and neo-medieval tunings,<br/>there is a contrast between pure or near-pure fifths and fourths and<br/>rather complex thirds and sixths. Regular major and minor thirds at<br/>about 418.43 cents and 286.18 cents are quite close to the complex<br/>JI ratios of 14:11 (~417.51 cents) and 33:28 (~284.45 cents). These<br/>are favorite sizes for neo-medieval thirds, either just or, as here,<br/>slightly tempered.</p><p>Without getting into fine points of harmony and style, I should<br/>explain that regular major thirds typically expand by stepwise<br/>contrary motion to stable fifths, while minor thirds contract to<br/>unisons: these intervals are themselves deemed _relatively_ concordant<br/>or blending, but unstable. The compact 77-cent diatonic semitones lend<br/>an incisive air to such directed progressions, as in these cadences<br/>with an octave notation using C4 for middle C:</p><p>             E4    F4                 G#4  A4<br/>             B3    C4                 E4   D4<br/>             G3    F3                 C#4  D4</p><p>The first three-voice cadence also shows the characteristic expansion<br/>of major sixth to octave, arriving at a complete stable sonority of<br/>outer octave, lower fifth, and upper fourth (F3-C4-F4). The second<br/>cadence arrives at a simple fifth (D4-A4). These 14th-century European<br/>progressions represent one side of what Bill Alves terms &quot;quintal<br/>counterpoint&quot; in the same issue of PNM as your article, a category<br/>embracing other world traditions including gamelan and its<br/>cross-cultural offshoots, the topic of his article.</p><p>Before from moving from 12 notes to 24, and to metachromatic or<br/>ultrachromatic refinements explored in a musical game I call &quot;Least<br/>Steps,&quot; let us consider one more feature of this basic tuning: the<br/>family of &quot;alternative thirds and sixths&quot; formed by intervals such as<br/>augmented seconds and diminished fourths.</p><p>In 12-tET, regular minor thirds and augmented seconds have the<br/>identical size of 300 cents, and likewise major thirds and diminished<br/>fourths at 400 cents -- although, as you point out, their perceived<br/>effects in musical context can be quite different.</p><p>In our temperament with wide fifths, however, their is an intonational<br/>distinction between a regular 286-cent minor third (e.g. E3-G3) and an<br/>augmented second (e.g. Eb3-F#3) at about 341.46 cents, the latter a<br/>&quot;supraminor third&quot; a bit wider than the complex just ratio of 17:14<br/>(~336.13 cents) or the 36-tET/72-tET interval of 333.33 cents.</p><p>Likewise, in contrast to the 418-cent major third (e.g. C-E), a<br/>diminished fourth (e.g. F#-Bb) or &quot;submajor third&quot; has a size of about<br/>363.14 cents, a bit narrower than a just 21:17 (~365.83 cents) or the<br/>36-tET/72-tET interval of 366.67 cents.</p><p>These alternative thirds, while differing in size and color from<br/>their regular counterparts, share a certain complex and active<br/>quality, while inviting resolutions involving 132-cent chromatic<br/>semitone steps, for example:</p><p>           Bb3  B3<br/>           F#3  E3<br/>           Eb3  E3</p><p>Here the lower supraminor third contracts to a unison, while the upper<br/>submajor third expands to a fifth, with chromatic steps of Eb3-E3 and<br/>Bb3-B3.</p><p>Having introduced some themes of variety, contrast, and drama, I would<br/>like to expand the stage to 24 notes, and to the smaller intervals<br/>which are the special focus of my game of &quot;Least Steps.&quot;</p><p>In the case of 12n-tET, as discussed in your article, the process of<br/>&quot;adding pitches&quot; involves dividing each equal semitone into a smaller<br/>number of equal parts -- quartertones (24-tET), sixth-tones (36-tET),<br/>eighth-tones (48-tET), or twelfth-tones (72-tET), etc.</p><p>For our regular but unequal temperament, the simplest way to add<br/>pitches is merely to continue the chain of fifths, let us say in the<br/>sharp direction, so generating 12 additional notes which we map to a<br/>second or upper manual. This new manual has an arrangement of steps<br/>and intervals identical to that of the first or lower manual -- a<br/>&quot;carbon copy,&quot; as it were, but with each note higher by 55.28 cents,<br/>the difference in size between the 77-cent and 132-cent semitones.<br/>Here an asterisk (*) shows a note raised by this 55-cent interval:</p><p>      188      341             683       892    1046<br/>       C#*    Eb*/D#            F#*      G#*    Bb*/A#<br/> C*        D*         E*   F*       G*       A*       B*  C*<br/> 55        264       474  551      760      969     1178  1255<br/>      209        209    77     209     209      209     77<br/>------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>      132     286               628      837     991<br/>       C#      Eb                F#       G#     Bb<br/> C          D          E    F        G        A        B   C<br/> 0         209        418  495      705      914     1123 1200<br/>      209        209     77     209     209      209     77</p><p>By mixing notes from the two manuals, either successively or<br/>simultaneously, we have an expanded universe of pitches, melodic<br/>steps, and sonorities to explore, with the identical patterns on the<br/>two keyboards providing, at least for me, a &quot;user-friendly interface.&quot;</p><p>Melodically, we have two types of smaller steps: the 55-cent interval<br/>I term a _diesis_, somewhere between the 66.67-cent thirdtone and<br/>50-cent quartertone of 72-tET (e.g. E4-E*4); and the 21.68-cent<br/>microinterval I term a &quot;subdiesis&quot; or comma (e.g. F#*3-G3). The latter<br/>is equal to the difference between the regular 77-cent semitone and<br/>the 55-cent diesis -- its 22-cent size is between that of the<br/>1/12-tone (16.67 cents) and 1/6-tone (33.33 cents) of 72-tET.</p><p>Having adopted the term &quot;metachromatic&quot; for progressions involving the<br/>55-cent diesis, I now find myself delightedly borrowing the term<br/>&quot;ultrachromatic&quot; to describe this 22-cent step. Thanks to you, and to<br/>Wyschnegradsky, whose work you celebrate in a new century.</p><p>Harmonically, our 24-note tuning introduces some intervals of a kind<br/>you mentioned enjoying in your article: 264.50-cent minor thirds close<br/>to 7:6 (~266.67 cents). We also find, for example, 440.11-cent major<br/>thirds near 9:7 (~435.08 cents), and 550.76-cent &quot;superfourths&quot; very<br/>close to 11:8 (~551.32 cents). As it happens, there are some small<br/>minor sevenths at 969.10 cents, a virtually pure approximation of 7:4<br/>(~968.83 cents).</p><p>The overall effect, at least in a neo-medieval setting, is one of a<br/>subtle continuum of simplicity/complexity or &quot;concord/discord&quot; -- an<br/>ethos which one could also, of course, realize in a larger system such<br/>as 72-tET, where these diverse types of intervals have close<br/>counterparts.</p><p>Here, our special interest is in melody, and in a challenge which your<br/>article raised for me: it&apos;s nice to have all those small intervals<br/>available on the keyboard, but how I can be sure that in my music they<br/>actually get used, and in a telling rather than tangential manner?</p><p>My own approach to this problem is contrapuntal, bringing together the<br/>dimensions of part-writing and distinctions of vertical sonority. To<br/>start the game of &quot;Least Steps,&quot; let us begin with this progression,<br/>with numbers in parentheses showing vertical intervals in cents above<br/>the lowest voice, and signed numbers show melodic motions, either<br/>ascending (positive) or descending (negative). Here the upper voices<br/>move in fourths, as they often do in 13th-14th century Gothic<br/>progressions; the tempo should be quite leisurely, to permit<br/>appreciation of the fine nuances:</p><p>      E4  -- +55 -- E*4 -- +22 -- F4 -- +132 -- F#4 --  +77 -- G4<br/>     (705)         (760)         (782)         (914)<br/>      B3  -- +55 -- B*4 -- +22 -- C4 -- +132 -- C#4 --  +77 -- D4<br/>     (209)         (264)         (286)         (418)<br/>      A3 ------------------------------------------ -- -209 -- G3</p><p>The voices start at the relatively concordant sonority of A3-B3-E4,<br/>common in some styles of 13th-century music, and in 20th-century terms<br/>a form of fourth chord or fifth chord. As in 12n-tET, this type of<br/>sonority has ratios quite close to 8:9:12.</p><p>The upper voices ascend by 55-cent steps to a small minor third and<br/>sixth -- about 264 cents and 760 cents -- above the lowest voice. On<br/>the continuum, these intervals might be described as close to 7:6<br/>and 14:9. For me, as also for an analyst of LaMonte Young&apos;s music in<br/>an earlier PNM, the 7:6 is rather &quot;cozy&quot; -- while, as you discuss,<br/>minor sixths at various ratios may tend toward complexity with their<br/>potential tension between partials.</p><p>We move next by 22-cent ultrachromatic steps to a regular minor third<br/>and sixth at 286 cents and 782 cents, the latter a near-just 11:7,<br/>a favorite size for a regular minor sixth in various tunings I use.<br/>Here the small melodic steps are associated with a subtle shift of<br/>vertical color or &quot;mood&quot; which may help to bring out this nuance.</p><p>The upper voices now move by comparatively large 132-cent steps --<br/>chromatic semitones -- from minor to major third and sixth at 418<br/>cents and 914 cents. This step size reminded me of the 133.33-cent<br/>motions you mentioned in your article.</p><p>There follows a usual medieval or neo-medieval cadence, with these<br/>intervals of regular major third and sixth expanding to fifth and<br/>octave, the upper voices ascending by 77-cent diatonic semitones, and<br/>the lowest voice, stationary to this point, descending by a regular<br/>209-cent whole-tone.</p><p>After coming up with this first exercise at the keyboard, I realized<br/>that I could subdivide the motion further, adding more steps and<br/>sonorities:</p><p>   E4  - +55 - E*4 - +22 - F4 - +55 - F*4 - +77 - F#4 -  +77 -- G4<br/>  (705)       (760)       (782)      (837)       (914)<br/>   B3  - +55 - B*4 - +22 - C4 - +55 - C*4 - +77 - C#4 -  +77 -- D4<br/>  (209)       (264)       (286)      (341)       (418)<br/>   A3 ------------------------------------------------- -209 -- G3</p><p>Here the opening sonorities and motions are the same; the regular<br/>minor third and sixth (A3-C4-F4), however, is followed by a 55-cent<br/>motion of the two upper voices to an intermediate sonority A3-C*4-F*4<br/>with supraminor third and sixth at 341 and 837 cents, and then a<br/>77-cent motion leading to the cadential major third and sixth<br/>(A3-C#4-F#4) which resolve as before.</p><p>This exercise reminded me of your observation as to how the same<br/>interval can have different musical meanings depending on context --<br/>as with the minor third and augmented second in 12n-tET at 300 cents.<br/>Here the first 77-cent motion in the upper voices, taking them from<br/>supraminor to major third and sixth, is clearly a kind of &quot;chromatic&quot;<br/>or maybe better &quot;enharmonic&quot; inflection; the following 77-cent motion<br/>is a routine cadential semitone. The pleasant parallel seems like a<br/>bridge between our worlds of intricate microtonality.</p><p>Most appreciatively,</p><p>Margo Schulter<br/><a href="mailto:mschulter@value.net">mschulter@value.net</a></p></div><h3>jwerntz2002 &#x3C;juliawerntz@attbi.com&#x3E;</h3><span>6/20/2002 1:49:32 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Margo,</p><p>Please forgive the delay in my response. Your post was full of information, and I<br/>wanted to read it carefully and digest it, but was held back by a busy schedule<br/>during the past week.</p><p>It was very interesting to read about your own process of adding pitches; it is truly<br/>a fascinating, parallel world, with some common points as well as many foreign<br/>aspects, as you pointed out. It occurs to me that one of the primary differences in<br/>approach is that mine (and that of others who use microtonal equal temperaments<br/>with no JI, Pythagorean, etc. intentions) doesn&apos;t really have much to do with<br/>&quot;tuning,&quot; per se. I realize that this also is certainly what Carl Lumma meant in his<br/>criticism of my use of the term &quot;temperament&quot; in this context. He had a point. It&apos;s<br/>a murky, semantic issue, but one which illustrates the difference in musical point of<br/>view, or tradition. &quot;Tuning&quot; would seem most often to imply the adjusting (whether<br/>in the pure or impure directions) of the pitch members of a preexisting hierarchical<br/>system, such as a &quot;functionally&quot; harmonic idiom, or a mode or scale. With music<br/>from a &quot;pan-tonal&quot; tradition (...I just don&apos;t want to use that nasty other &quot;a-word&quot;<br/>anymore), like mine, the most &quot;tuning&quot; can mean is &quot;playing the intervals<br/>accurately,&quot; since the &quot;system,&quot; or underlying functional logic, is idiosyncratic to<br/>each piece. The intervals are there, the musician&apos;s ears are trained, but the<br/>chromatic in this case isn&apos;t something that&apos;s &quot;tuned&quot;; it&apos;s more of a grid that&apos;s been<br/>made, like 12-note equal temperament (and which similarly allows for some<br/>coloristic or expressive inflection). Ezra Sims&apos; scale, derived from the same<br/>72-note chromatic, *can* be more properly called a &quot;tuning,&quot; for example.<br/>(Though I believe Ezra also allows room for some minute pitch inflection.)</p><p>You wrote:<br/>&quot;The second is an invitation for me, as someone who makes music with an<br/>assortment of just intonation systems and tempered systems, to<br/>distinguish this practice and theory from &quot;rules&quot; of &quot;pure tuning&quot;<br/>which might exclude most of my favorite JI tunings as yet more<br/>&quot;dissonant&quot; or &quot;out of tune&quot; than 12-tone equal temperament. Your<br/>eloquent praise for certain JI compositions celebrates prime musical<br/>values toward which I also strive: complex ratios, and novel types of<br/>intervals both vertical and melodic.&quot;</p><p>I do realize that there are people like you who come to JI from this angle - seeking<br/>&quot;novel types of intervals&quot; - and that this is more-or-less where I was coming from<br/>in choosing to add pitches in the perhaps cruder way that I do, just grabbing them<br/>directly from in-between the semitones. I also realize that there certainly is a good<br/>amount of disagreement about the term &quot;just intonation&quot; itself, as there is about<br/>most general musical terms of this kind. I noticed you include complex, &quot;out of<br/>tune&quot; ratios in your definition, while others don&apos;t (some even insist that beats must<br/>not be present for music to be truly justly tuned).

Your post was full of<br/>&gt; information, and I wanted to read it carefully and digest it, but was<br/>&gt; held back by a busy schedule during the past week.</p><p>Please let me thank you not only for having the patience to read a<br/>quite long post, but for taking the time to reply so thoughtfully. I<br/>hope that my response to your article shows such reflection and<br/>consideration.</p><p>The give and take of this kind of dialogue is a special treat and<br/>honor for me, and I deeply appreciate any time you can give to this<br/>process along with all of your responsibilities and commitments.</p><p>This is a precious learning process, mutual, of course, but something<br/>which I find especially in keeping with your role as a teacher as well<br/>as a composer. Already, both your article and your responses here have<br/>taught me new ways of looking at music, and I hope that, to borrow an<br/>old saying, a major part of the syllabus will prove to be a deeper<br/>empathy and understanding regarding the different ways we approach this<br/>wonderful world of music.</p><p>&gt; It was very interesting to read about your own process of adding<br/>&gt; pitches; it is truly a fascinating, parallel world, with some common<br/>&gt; points as well as many foreign aspects, as you pointed out. It<br/>&gt; occurs to me that one of the primary differences in approach is that<br/>&gt; mine (and that of others who use microtonal equal temperaments with<br/>&gt; no JI, Pythagorean, etc. intentions) doesn&apos;t really have much to do<br/>&gt; with &quot;tuning,&quot; per se. I realize that this also is certainly what<br/>&gt; Carl Lumma meant in his criticism of my use of the term<br/>&gt; &quot;temperament&quot; in this context. He had a point. It&apos;s a murky,<br/>&gt; semantic issue, but one which illustrates the difference in musical<br/>&gt; point of view, or tradition.</p><p>The shared perception we have of &quot;parallel worlds&quot; seems like a very<br/>fertile direction to take, and at this point I might just offer a<br/>quick aside. While some people here have adopted the term &quot;equal<br/>division of the octave&quot; (EDO), for example &quot;72-EDO,&quot; to avoid some of<br/>the implications of &quot;tuning&quot; or &quot;temperament&quot; that you and Carl are<br/>raising, I do want to say that I consider &quot;72-tone equal temperament&quot;<br/>(72-tET or 72-ET) standard usage, and often go either way.</p><p>&gt; &quot;Tuning&quot; would seem most often to imply the adjusting (whether in<br/>&gt; the pure or impure directions) of the pitch members of a preexisting<br/>&gt; hierarchical system, such as a &quot;functionally&quot; harmonic idiom, or a<br/>&gt; mode or scale. With music from a &quot;pan-tonal&quot; tradition (...I just<br/>&gt; don&apos;t want to use that nasty other &quot;a-word&quot; anymore), like mine, the<br/>&gt; most &quot;tuning&quot; can mean is &quot;playing the intervals accurately,&quot; since<br/>&gt; the &quot;system,&quot; or underlying functional logic, is idiosyncratic to<br/>&gt; each piece. The intervals are there, the musician&apos;s ears are<br/>&gt; trained, but the chromatic in this case isn&apos;t something that&apos;s<br/>&gt; &quot;tuned&quot;; it&apos;s more of a grid that&apos;s been made, like 12-note equal<br/>&gt; temperament (and which similarly allows for some coloristic or<br/>&gt; expressive inflection). Ezra Sims&apos; scale, derived from the same<br/>&gt; 72-note chromatic, *can* be more properly called a &quot;tuning,&quot; for<br/>&gt; example.  (Though I believe Ezra also allows room for some minute<br/>&gt; pitch inflection.)</p><p>Thank you for shedding some light on your parallel universe: the idea<br/>of a &quot;given grid&quot; here is very expressive. In response, I should begin<br/>by acknowledging that indeed my &quot;tuning&quot; process _is_ colored by a<br/>certain &quot;preexisting hierarchical system&quot; or &quot;harmonic idiom&quot; -- in my<br/>case, that of 13th-14th century Europe, with some new elements mixed<br/>in.</p><p>In your approach -- a tuning system as a grid that&apos;s simply &quot;given&quot;<br/>rather than fine-tuned, so to speak -- there&apos;s a special kind of<br/>discipline and devotion that I deeply respect: taking the everyday and<br/>familiar, and doing something new and creative with it. This seems to<br/>me a part of the creative impulse of 12-note pantonalism, and your<br/>carrying of this kind of approach to a 72-note grid, your concept of<br/>&quot;Atwelve-tonality,&quot; is a very impressive musical as well as<br/>intellectual development of this kind of current of musicmaking.</p><p>At one level, our musical worlds may have a certain mirrored contrast<br/>and symmetry. You seem to be taking a more or less traditional grid --<br/>with the important element of the added pitches, of course -- and<br/>doing new and exciting things, including making sure those microsteps<br/>really stand out in their own right. In contrast, I often seem to be<br/>devising a range of new tunings, and doing more or less traditional<br/>things with them. As it happens, my tradition is a few centuries older<br/>than some people are used to, so it can sound &quot;new,&quot; but that makes it<br/>no less traditional or routine to me.</p><p>At another level, however, I wonder whether even a carefully<br/>calculated and nuanced tuning system isn&apos;t also to a very considerable<br/>degree a &quot;found object&quot; with surprises and unintended consequences --<br/>or, one might say, random acts of musical kindness waiting to be<br/>discovered.</p><p>Those of us who do play the game of &quot;designer tunings,&quot; and then try<br/>them out at the keyboard or wherever -- and people like George Secor<br/>here have been at this for far more years than I have -- find that<br/>there are all kinds of surprises that didn&apos;t necessarily enter to the<br/>design.</p><p>Often serendipity is where it&apos;s at: pick some numbers that look<br/>intuitively interesting, tune it up, play a bit, and _then_ say: &quot;Hey,<br/>this is a new and wonderful type of interval or progression or<br/>whatever.&quot;</p><p>Maybe I come up with something in 12 notes, like it, and then a few<br/>months later suddenly ask, &quot;What if I carry this to 24 notes?&quot; -- and<br/>find some more surprises waiting for me.</p><p>Having said this, I&apos;d like to express my admiration for you in taking<br/>what seems to me the more radical and exacting path: seeking new<br/>melodic patterns and properties from the more or less &quot;familiar,&quot; and<br/>adopting a discipline to make it more likely that new patterns emerge,<br/>as distinct from either historical styles or the academic kind of<br/>composition with a few quartertone inflections that&apos;s addressed in<br/>your article.</p><p>To express some of this discipline in your &quot;Atwelve-tonality,&quot; maybe<br/>I&apos;m tempted to propose the term &quot;panmelody&quot; or &quot;panmelodiousness&quot; --<br/>an emphasis on the smaller steps as basic ingredients rather than mere<br/>&quot;modifications&quot; of the larger and more familiar ones.</p><p>Like &quot;pantonal,&quot; &quot;panmelodic&quot; could be a more positive assertion of<br/>this &quot;emancipation of microsteps.&quot; I wonder how well these terms seem<br/>to fit together.</p><p>&gt; I do realize that there are people like you who come to JI from this<br/>&gt; angle - seeking &quot;novel types of intervals&quot; - and that this is<br/>&gt; more-or-less where I was coming from in choosing to add pitches in<br/>&gt; the perhaps cruder way that I do, just grabbing them directly from<br/>&gt; in-between the semitones. I also realize that there certainly is a<br/>&gt; good amount of disagreement about the term &quot;just intonation&quot; itself,<br/>&gt; as there is about most general musical terms of this kind. I noticed<br/>&gt; you include complex, &quot;out of tune&quot; ratios in your definition, while<br/>&gt; others don&apos;t (some even insist that beats must not be present for<br/>&gt; music to be truly justly tuned). (Some would call Ezra&apos;s music just,<br/>&gt; but he wouldn&apos;t.)</p><p>Please let me apologize for the length of what follows, an attempt to<br/>bring a bit of historical and cross-cultural perspective to the<br/>question of complex JI and related issues.</p><p>First, with due musicianly humility, I would like to say our methods<br/>of adding pitches might often seem to share a certain &quot;automatic&quot; or<br/>&quot;mechanical&quot; aspect: whether it&apos;s dividing semitones equally, or<br/>taking a chain of identically sized fifths and adding some more to<br/>generate more notes.</p><p>Also, from my perspective, &quot;just grabbing&quot; notes &quot;directly from<br/>in-between the semitones&quot; can also be a fine art. I reflect on Busoni,<br/>whose &quot;tripartite&quot; division of the tone into thirdtones and then<br/>sixthtones (36-tET) was based on an exquisitely discerning<br/>appreciation for the melodic inflections and nuances of string<br/>players. He also very carefully considered the musical consequences of<br/>his division, its compatibility with existing music, and so forth.</p><p>To me, 36-tET is a thing of beauty melodically and harmonically, and<br/>maybe I should compose something in it in your honor, and Busoni&apos;s</p><p>As far as JI, what it says to me mainly is that one chooses to<br/>approach pitches or intervals in terms of integer ratios -- large or<br/>small, simple or complex, with whatever &quot;concord/discord&quot; conventions<br/>or character might attach in a given cultural or stylistic concept.</p><p>Maybe I&apos;d compare JI -- tuning by integer ratios -- to a technique of<br/>counterpoint like retrograde inversion. Someone familiar only with a<br/>15th-century European use of this technique, for example, might assume<br/>that the specific stylistic conventions regarding things like<br/>&quot;concord&quot; and &quot;discord&quot; are inherent in the technique itself.</p><p>However, a 20th-century pantonalist might study 15th-century examples<br/>in order to apply retrograde inversion in a serialist context with a<br/>radically different approach to intervals -- as I understand has<br/>actually happened. It&apos;s not &quot;retrograde inversion&quot; or &quot;JI&quot; (tuning by<br/>ratios) itself that imposes the conventions, but a specific cultural,<br/>stylistic, or personal preference.</p><p>Personally, I find the larger or more complex ratios a beautiful and<br/>invigorating aspect of JI, musically and intellectually, and often<br/>part of the idea of a tuning as at least in part &quot;found object.&quot;</p><p>It&apos;s the nature of small integer ratios to generate large and more<br/>complex ones -- a kind of branching or ramification, and something<br/>that often produces extra and unplanned kinds of intervals, musical<br/>opportunities waiting to be discovered and appreciated.</p><p>It can also be a kind of game of free association. For example, on<br/>this list, the ratio 74:64 came up, which reduces to 37:32. Some<br/>people would call that &quot;the 37th harmonic&quot;: I just consider it a neat<br/>ratio, maybe like one of those mathematical parameters you mention for<br/>a piece by Xenakis.</p><p>It turns out that 37:32 has a size of about 251.34 cents, a very<br/>interesting size, in conventional terms about midway between a major<br/>second and a minor third. In 24/48/72-tET, there&apos;s a quartertone step<br/>at 250 cents -- not quite identical, but very close. As it happens,<br/>one of my JI systems based on two 12-note Pythagorean sets has an<br/>interval of 14336:12393, about 252.14 cents -- also very close.</p><p>I very much like this part of the spectrum, whether approached in a<br/>just or tempered tuning: it can have pleasantly &quot;cool&quot; and<br/>sophisticated color for me, a new kind of &quot;concord&quot; or character. By<br/>the way, I find 24-tET a tuning with some stunning musical qualities;<br/>it&apos;s also a way for me to get in touch with certain aspects of the<br/>20th century, another side of the realm of world musics in many times<br/>and places.</p><p>At the end of this article, I&apos;m including a link to a short<br/>composition I did in this tuning, using the 14336:12393 as one of the<br/>intervals.</p><p>Quickly, I should say that approaches to JI that recognize larger<br/>ratios aren&apos;t new: this is, for example, an important aspect of<br/>13th-14th century European practice and theory, where the simple<br/>device of tuning a chain of pure 3:2 fifths or 4:3 fourths generates<br/>some very large and complex ratios that play an important role in the<br/>music.</p><p>For example, a theorist named Jacobus of Liege recognizes a degree of<br/>&quot;concord&quot; or &quot;compatibility&quot; in ratios such as 81:64, 32:27, 27:16,<br/>9:8, and 9:4 -- as in some 20th-century theory, there is a subtle<br/>continuum or gradation. Of course, _any_ scale of &quot;concord/discord&quot; is<br/>a cultural or stylistic construct, but my point is that JI theory can<br/>involve diversity and contrast.</p><p>From a cross-cultural perspective, I might add that I&apos;ve discussed the<br/>European tradition because that&apos;s an important source for my own<br/>outlook; but the medieval Near Eastern tradition recognizes an even<br/>wider range of JI ratios like 14:13 and 13:12 and 7:6 and 27:22. It&apos;s<br/>interesting that Ibn Sina (a name Latinized as Avicenna), a Persian<br/>philosopher who exerted an immense influence on Gothic Europe, also<br/>wrote about some beautiful scales with ratios like these.</p><p>To all these numbers, I&apos;d add your vital reminder about &quot;coloristic or<br/>expressive inflections&quot; -- integer ratios or cents are a kind of map<br/>which singers or even players of fretted instruments dance _around_.<br/>What I&apos;m visualizing is a kind of decorative grid pattern on a dance<br/>floor: the grid is there, now how do we dance around it, pantonally or<br/>otherwise?</p><p>With the music of Ezra Sims, I might guess that his point is that<br/>certain 72-tET intervals are very close to JI ratios, but that he<br/>regards this as an approximation rather than a precise equivalence.<br/>What I&apos;d say is that _some_ JI ratios are heard as beatless when tuned<br/>with sufficient precision -- a 3:2, for example, in contrast to<br/>something considerably more complex. Thus a fifth tuned about 2 cents<br/>narrow in 72-tET, or 2 cents wide in one of my &quot;near-just&quot; tunings,<br/>could have some slow but audible beating making the texture subtly<br/>different than a pure 3:2. Timbre plays a role here also.</p><p>From another point of view, Sims might be recognizing that 72-tET has<br/>a somewhat different &quot;mapping&quot; or architecture than a scheme with<br/>integer ratios for very similar types of intervals. The conceptual<br/>structure is a bit different.</p><p>For example, as mentioned above, a 250-cent interval in 72-tET is very<br/>close to 37:32, but a system featuring a just 37:32 might have a<br/>certain association or &quot;branching out&quot; of ratios making the &quot;grid&quot; at<br/>least a bit more asymmetrical and uneven. For example, we might find<br/>37:32 associated with 36:32 or 9:8 (a usual JI major second) plus a<br/>37:36 (about 47 cents, a kind of &quot;quartertone&quot; close to 24-tET).</p><p>The maps are a bit different, although they often can lead to similar<br/>destinations. One might say either, &quot;This tempered interval sounds to<br/>me identical to an integer-based ratio, so I&apos;ll call it just&quot;; or &quot;The<br/>maps are a bit different, and maybe the sounds a bit different, also,<br/>so I&apos;d rather keep the two categories distinct.&quot;</p><p>Again, the footsteps of the dancers in a performance, with their<br/>&quot;minute pitch inflection,&quot; might be larger than the theoretical<br/>distance between the ideal points on these &quot;maps&quot; -- like art, and<br/>life generally, it&apos;s an open question.</p><p>&gt; Thanks for such an interesting post. I would be very interested to<br/>&gt; hear the music!  How is this possible?</p><p>One first approach, however imperfect, is to share a few items through<br/>the MIDI format -- that brief piece I mentioned, _Salutation for Mary<br/>Beth Ackerley, envision&apos;d as Lysistrata_, and some odd snippets in the<br/>temperament I mentioned in my previous post.</p><p>Coding a score on computer and having it translated automatically into<br/>a MIDI file isn&apos;t the most expressive performance, and I realize that<br/>not everyone has the means to listen to these files (I can generate<br/>them and proofread the output codes, but not hear them). However, I<br/>offer these items as a possible start.</p><p>Here&apos;s the piece, a kind of keyboard prelude, including that sonority<br/>with 14436:13392, a tad larger than the 72-tET interval of 250 cents:</p><p><a href="http://value.net/~mschulter/mary002.mid">http://value.net/~mschulter/mary002.mid</a></p><p>For quick MIDI snippets, some involving &quot;ultrachromaticism,&quot; I&apos;m<br/>giving a URL to the third article in a series on the temperament I&apos;ve<br/>been mentioning -- cautioning that the musical examples, the main<br/>point of interest here, are interspersed among lots of theory.
