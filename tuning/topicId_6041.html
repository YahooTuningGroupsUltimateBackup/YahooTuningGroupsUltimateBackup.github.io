Foreign cars<br/>had more variety.

The<br/>first time I heard this I literally fell off my seat... his control of<br/>the daxophone really has to be heard to be believed. And FWIW, I also<br/>think that Reichel is absolutely THE most undervalued guitar player on<br/>the planet... and he&apos;s really not at all what one might think of when<br/>one thinks of the FMP gang... his music can be as intoxicatingly<br/>user-friendly, as it is a one-of-a-kind state-of-the-art solo guitar<br/>improvisation (even to these old and somewhat jaded ears...).</p><p>Dan</p></div>
