To that track I added 5 tracks of my homemade DIY 11-edo stick (eleven notes per octave instead of twelve) with some bridge modification.. Each stick track was run through guitar rig 4. I left Norm&apos;s track alone because it was perfect as is.</p><p>online play, links, story, pictures:<br/><a href="http://chrisvaisvil.com/?p=617">http://chrisvaisvil.com/?p=617</a></p><p>download<br/><a href="http://micro.soonlabel.com/11-ET/daily20110321-mother-dropped-11-nuts.mp3">http://micro.soonlabel.com/11-ET/daily20110321-mother-dropped-11-nuts.mp3</a></p><p>Chris</p></div>
