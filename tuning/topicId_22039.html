Really!</h1><h3>jpehrson@rcn.com</h3><span>5/3/2001 8:55:22 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>As some of you are undoubtedly aware, there has been some fascinating<br/>discussion recently  on the CSOUND list which is related to the topic<br/>on this list about &quot;open source&quot; software.  Generally speaking, the<br/>CSOUND list is more noted for such arcane postings as long lines of<br/>source code  (they make me nervous, since I know if even ONE little<br/>letter is off oh well.)</p><p>The discussion centers upon the whole revolution, I believe, which<br/>*is* or at least *was* the Internet and the idea that intellectual<br/>property *CAN*  (note, I didn&apos;t say &quot;should be&quot;) a *SHARED* human<br/>experience.  This, of course, applies to both programs, source code<br/>and, even, .mp3&apos;s as we can see with the recent wrestling of<br/>contemporary society with  <a href="http://mp3.com">mp3.com</a> and Napster.</p><p>Of course, such grandiose intellectual sharing implies an entirely<br/>different economic model, if there is one, and we needn&apos;t get into<br/>that here.</p><p>Regarding the more limited discussion on the CSOUND list, the<br/>question regards the posting of .orc and .sco (orchestra and score<br/>files the basic building blocks of the compositions) and the<br/>right<br/>of composers to share or &quot;tweak&quot; others&apos; work.  Personally, I&apos;m<br/>finding this discussion fascinating, and related to some of the &quot;open<br/>source&quot; discussions we have been having on this list.</p><p>Naturally, since it is a &quot;flame war,&quot; our good friend Jeff Harrington<br/>is in the middle of it.</p><p>In the spirit of the &quot;open source&quot; movement, I am freely copying from<br/>the CSOUND list to THIS list for our mutual edification,<br/>entertainment and, possibly, exasperation:</p><p>Harrington&apos;s post:</p><p>&quot;This statement also evinces a complete lack of understanding of the<br/>way any artists work.  Give me credit... Sorry to be blunt, but the<br/>Csound community is divided, IMO, into two very obvious camps, the<br/>programmers/geeks and the composers.  Most of the programmers call<br/>themselves composers but actually don&apos;t do anything but tweak sounds<br/>endlessly.  This project promotes that type of musical tweaking way<br/>above real artistry.</p><p>This project as I pointed out in a not so apt way, is prejudicial to<br/>artists.  It promotes a pathetic view of music as sound &quot;work&quot; and<br/>not a poetic expression that is labored over.  I can guarantee you,<br/>that you&apos;ll find no artists participating in this project but a few<br/>student geeks if you don&apos;t find a way to temper the projects bias<br/>towards &quot;sharing&quot; of credit.</p><p>Outside of the &quot;remix&quot; phenomenon in the electronica world, there is<br/>no model of this type of collaboration producing anything<br/>significant.  This doesn&apos;t mean it can&apos;t work, of course, but my<br/>guess is that the geeks who want to try this out are really looking<br/>for two things.</p><p>1.  They want to get credit for making sounds themselves as pieces,<br/>because they&apos;re too lame a composer to finish a whole piece.</p><p>2.  They want to get credit for being cool anarchists in sharing<br/>these &quot;works&quot; in a Open Source way.  Music is NOT a form of<br/>programming!  I&apos;m a programmer and a musician and I know the<br/>difference.  Many of the programmers on the list do not.</p><p>By prejudicing the project against completed works of art where the<br/>artist refuses to allow further &quot;commentary&quot; you will guarantee this<br/>project dies the same lame death that all the other &quot;sharing&quot; art<br/>projects do.  And the whole project plays into this phenomenon we<br/>have on the list of programmers who call themselves composers without<br/>ever writing a piece.  And now they&apos;re dissing the composers... who<br/>would have thunk that!  :)</p><p>You know, what pisses me off the most about the insinuations about<br/>the project is a core insinuation about selfishness.  It&apos;s not enough<br/>that serious artists today have problems with distribution,<br/>competition with pop culture, but we&apos;ve got geeks accusing us of not<br/>sharing enough.</p><p>Might I suggest that there are many artists out there that would love<br/>to participate in this project with one basic proviso:</p><p>&quot;Don&apos;t even think about touching my shit.  But please listen to it<br/>and love it without cost to you and please listen to my friend&apos;s<br/>music on the tree too.&quot;</p><p>jeff harrington<br/>Open Source Java Programmer and Composer<br/>Don&apos;t Tread on Me! :)<br/><a href="http://www.parnasse.com/jeff.htm">http://www.parnasse.com/jeff.htm</a></p><p>And, just one other post as a  response to a &quot;riposte&quot;:</p><p>&gt; Jeff.:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; For a few years now, there&apos;s probably a new kind of artistry<br/>happening. Maldonano, FFitch, Ingalls, Zicarrelli, Max Matthews,  the<br/>people at native instruments, Tom Erbe..., are some of these new<br/>artists. Providing you tools so that you can make your own tools.<br/>&gt;</p><p>&quot;Their work is appreciated by this composer and they know it.<br/>Calling them artists however, for programming work, even the<br/>conceptualization of tools is an exaggeration I believe, but not<br/>worthy of a semantic argument.</p><p>&gt; What Robino has proposed is simply a way to catalog Csound sounds<br/>and their evolution. Pretty much the same way that the Virus or<br/>NordLead community share their sounds, but also charting their<br/>growth.</p><p>&gt; No one suggests these are compositions, although some are very<br/>artistic and inspiring.<br/>&gt;</p><p>My commentary was on the discussion and the direction it was being<br/>led in.  The suggestions were made that these were compositions and<br/>the suggestion was made that their was some type of ethical<br/>superiority to sound work that was &quot;shared&quot; over complete<br/>compositions.  It was this insinuation that I was railing against.</p><p>&gt; I&apos;m sure, however, the Ctree could include compositions. It would<br/>be great to see the evolution and growth of some of your work, from a<br/>first draft to final piece.<br/>&gt;</p><p>That would be cool, but it would expose some of the magic that I<br/>attempt to hide in my pieces.  (In other words, I would probably not<br/>want to share the inept pre-compositional moments with my colleagues!<br/>Ha ahahaha...).</p><p>Eloy, I&apos;m well aware of the many places I can share my Csound<br/>compostions being one of the earliest composers on the web (1991) to<br/>share not only my source (complete PS scores, complete orc and sco<br/>files) but complete realizations.  What I would love to see, is what<br/>Giorgio suggested earlier on (although the bias towards evolving<br/>sound work was already evident) that this would be a powerful way to<br/>demonstrate to not just to the Csound community, but the web at<br/>large, the power of Csound and the beauty being created by many<br/>members of the Csound community, programmers and musicians alike.  My<br/>commentary was attempting to drive home the fact early biases in the<br/>conceptualization of these structures can doom the project to another<br/>shared web project (like that MIDI project in the early 1990&apos;s).</p><p>Artists need your help and artists, frankly, are the only reason<br/>Csound exists.  It is used by programmers to share code, DSP<br/>algorhythms, etc... but Csound is a tool not for making Csound but<br/>for one thing:</p><p>Making music.  And musicians that use Csound need support and need<br/>your ears.  I would hope that the entire Csound community would rally<br/>around this project and other projects suggested recently to promote<br/>Csound music and musicians.  If Csound is to evolve beyond a geek<br/>programmer plaything and into a real tool, it&apos;ll need musical<br/>evidence that it is worthy of the steep learning curve required to<br/>use it.</p><p>jeff harrington<br/><a href="http://www.parnasse.com/jeff.htm">http://www.parnasse.com/jeff.htm</a></p><p>__________ _____ _____ _____<br/>Joseph Pehrson</p></div>
