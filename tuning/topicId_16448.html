Those that can be heard both<br/>&gt; ways are found in between. If you were to envision the 12 chromatic<br/>&gt; pitches in series as the numbers on the face of a clock, pairs in which<br/>&gt; the first member is in the upper half of the clock will result in more<br/>&gt; descending perceptions, and those in the bottom with more ascending<br/>&gt; perceptions. Pitch classes at the top or bottom of &quot;the clock&quot; are the<br/>&gt; least ambiguous. This can be seen in the figure below which represents the<br/>&gt; proportion of times each interval pair is heard as descending for a<br/>&gt; hypothetical subject.&quot;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; ?  How does the position in the circle of fifths mean anything here?<br/>&gt; An absolute pitch effect??  The study claims that these tendencies are<br/>&gt; consistent within a geographical area, but differ across geographical<br/>&gt; areas. ??</p><p>As I remember it, the pitches aren&apos;t arranged around the clock in the<br/>cycle of fifths, but in ascending/descending chromatic order. You might<br/>hear the pairs this way, where upper-case means higher:</p><p>              C<br/>           B     C#<br/>        bb         D<br/>       a            Eb<br/>        ab         E<br/>          g      f<br/>              f#</p><p>so that the line falls between B-F and Bb-E pairs, whereas I might hear it<br/>this way:</p><p>              c<br/>           b     c#<br/>        bb         D<br/>       a            Eb<br/>        ab         E<br/>          G      F<br/>              F#</p><p>so that the line falls between the pairs G-C# and D-Ab... The claim re<br/>geographical areas was that there was a correlation between the way you<br/>hear the pairs and the pitch tendencies of the people speaking your native<br/>language where you grew up. I think the study groups in the original<br/>research were in California and in the UK somewhere. Presumably people<br/>tend to speak with a lower average frequency in one of those areas than in<br/>the other, and it was suggested that the note that was closer to the<br/>average speech frequency would be perceived as lower of the pairs.</p><p>There were lots of arguments about the validity of the geographical<br/>correlation in the pages of Music Perception, and later studies couldn&apos;t<br/>reproduce the correlation.</p><p>cheers --Jon</p></div><h3>Seth Austen &#x3C;acoustic@landmarknet.net&#x3E;</h3><span>12/11/2000 1:43:28 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>on 12/11/00 2:26 PM, <a href="mailto:tuning@egroups.com">tuning@egroups.com</a> at <a href="mailto:tuning@egroups.com">tuning@egroups.com</a> wrote:</p><p>&gt; Slonimsky&apos;s book has a different system - as I understand it he splits the<br/>&gt; scale into equal divisions of intervals and then &quot;interpolates&quot; approaches<br/>&gt; to each tone.
