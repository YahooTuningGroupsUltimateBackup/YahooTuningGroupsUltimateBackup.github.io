Yes, this<br/>doesn&apos;t do much for the &quot;cause&quot; of contemporary or microtonal music,<br/>for sure, since Stockhausen was definitely a microtonalist<br/>(sometimes).</p><p>However, it is not all that surprising.  When I met Stockhausen in<br/>the mid 1970&apos;s he was already a supreme egotist and megalomaniac.<br/>You could see it in his eyes.  He was a little &quot;nuts&quot; even then.</p><p>HOWEVER, he *had* written some good works, like, in particular<br/>_Gruppen_, _Stimmung_, and some of the earlier pieces, like<br/>_Kontrapunkte_, _Kontacte_ (a great electronic piece), and at the<br/>time I met him at Darmstadt he was banging the H*ll out of gongs...</p><p>This post is still &quot;on topic&quot; since, as many people know, many of his<br/>early pioneering efforts were in microtonality, such as _Studie II_<br/>and others, which used non-octave equivalence.  See Brian McLaren&apos;s<br/>_Microtonality, Past, Present, Future_ for more details.</p><p>Stockhausen visited San Francisco in the 1960&apos;s and that really did<br/>something to him.  My impression is that he ingested various chemical<br/>substances with great vigor, and he was never quite the same<br/>thereafter.</p><p>His works became *spectacular,* non-music, more theatrical than<br/>anything.</p><p>Deutche Grammaphone dropped his contract.  That was incredible in<br/>itself, since he was considered at one point the *next great German<br/>composer* which is, of course, always something thought about over<br/>there...  His CDs are still available, and he even has a website, but<br/>he charges $80 per CD.  He obviously believes he deserves to price<br/>them this way.  It seems that few people agree...</p><p>So if art=spectacle, I guess that&apos;s where he&apos;s getting off with<br/>this... Although it is pretty amazing that he could say something<br/>like this without considering the &quot;humanitarian&quot; consequences...</p><p>Of course, I don&apos;t really believe Stockhausen could ever have been<br/>considered a &quot;humanitarian...&quot;</p><p>It was that look in his eyes.</p><p>For me, personally, a boycott is appropriate...</p><p>_________ __________ _____________<br/>Joseph Pehrson</p></div>
