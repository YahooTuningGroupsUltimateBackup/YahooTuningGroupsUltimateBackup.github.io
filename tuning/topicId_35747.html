Maybe he realized as did Anastasia<br/>how able a viola could be and discarded his original adapted viola?<br/>Incidentally, the studs do nothing for the timbre as they are between<br/>strings, as I understand it.  Kind of odd for Partch to include them, except<br/>for &quot;looks&quot;, when he, himself, had perfect pitch.  It appears that microtonal<br/>violists like Solberg, and at lest 5 others I&apos;ve worked with on Li Po do not<br/>need them or use them.</p><p>&gt; &gt; Also, it would ideally require 2 different instruments in order to<br/>&gt; perform<br/>&gt; &gt; all 17 pieces because some have a shaved down bridge (for 3 strings<br/>&gt; at a time<br/>&gt; &gt; playing) and some do not.

Partch&apos;s viola had a bridge that was<br/>&gt; flattened for triads, but with an insertable tooth to raise the<br/>&gt; middle string in the triad.</p><p>This is fantastic news!  Thank you and where did you learn of this<br/>&quot;insertable tooth&quot;?</p><p>&gt; No doubt about Partch&apos;s imagination. But his own technique<br/>&gt; (&quot;veena&quot;, &quot;one-finger&quot;) is probably harder to imitate on de bracchio<br/>&gt; instruments. It could be that that&apos;s why he later rewrote his adapted<br/>&gt; viola parts for cello.</p><p>The superior technique by a virtuoso microtonal violist circumvents any<br/>difficulty with the one finger technique of Partch.  Perhaps a violist could<br/>angle the instrument for gravity purposes on the finger to get the sense?  In<br/>the hands of a master, upbows and downbows put in by Partch are actually<br/>irrelevant.  The player can effect either.  Partch actually suggested either<br/>viola or cello could play his Li Po songs.</p><p>   The cello has to be restrung a fifth higher<br/>&gt; (although many scores have the high 27/16 string tuned down to a 6:5<br/>&gt; above the 9/8 string), but it would be easier to negotiate long,<br/>&gt; slow, glissandi on, as in &quot;San Francisco&quot;.<br/>&gt;<br/>I love doing the Li Po with cello, but there is a different relationship with<br/>my voice.  The viola is closer to my voice in timbre, and his, too.  When<br/>Partch gives the vocal line to a tenor, the voice sounds an octave higher<br/>than the pitches indicated on the chromelodeon.  That Partch splits the Li Po<br/>between 2 voices led me to think there were 2 instruments needed...ah, but<br/>with an insert for the bridge, hmmm.  BTW, what is your name?</p><p>Best, Johnny Reinhard</p></div>
