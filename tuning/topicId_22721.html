Program searches<br/>for these by looking for two messages immediately following<br/>each other that are identical, but could miss them if<br/>there are other messages in between.</p><p>However, once we are fairly sure that the archive _is_ complete,<br/>then it is an easy matter to go through and change the message<br/>numbers for any posts that are clearly out of sequence (such as,<br/>someone posts a file, and someone else comments on it apparently<br/>before it was posted), and to delete any duplicates anyone notices.</p><p>I want to complete the archive first, as the message numbers change<br/>depending on how many messages are in the archive.</p><p>At some much later date, may add a little search engine too,<br/>- the archiver program would make lists of all the message numbers for<br/>each word in the archive, then maybe have a java applet or app.<br/>that would read the lists of message numbers for each word in the search phrase,<br/>and filter by each word in turn, and make a html page for the results.<br/>I think perhaps it would need to be a java app. rather than applet<br/>to do that, for the file permissions.</p><p>I think that would be practical, and probably reasonably fast too.<br/>Also not too complex in the way of java, so I could reasonably<br/>code it if some time I do some more java programming and<br/>get into the way of it again. (Or if anyone else would like<br/>to write one, the lists of message numbers for each word would<br/>be pretty easy for my message archiver to make, or, maybe<br/>there is a free app that does it already,...)</p><p>Idea is, would be a tiny app that one would include in the same<br/>page as the html (or a link to it anyway if it is an app.),<br/>then you run it to search the archive.</p><p>I plan to upload it as html, and then as zips of 5 Mb files<br/>which Joseph thought sounded a suitable kind of size for them.</p><p>Robert</p></div><h3><a id=22723 href="#22723">ðŸ”—</a>jpehrson@rcn.com</h3><span>5/13/2001 9:22:54 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In tuning@y..., &quot;Robert Walker&quot; &lt;robert_walker@r...&gt; wrote:</p><p><a href="/tuning/topicId_22721.html#22721">/tuning/topicId_22721.html#22721</a></p><p>Robert!</p><p>This is really fantastic work...
