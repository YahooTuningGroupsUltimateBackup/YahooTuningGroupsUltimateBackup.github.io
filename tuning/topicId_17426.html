I read some of your earlier posts while on holiday,<br/>but haven&apos;t been posting much. Planned to do some reading around on this topic,<br/>but lost all my photocopies in a carrier bag in a coach station. Had a really<br/>refreshing break instead.</p><p>Let&apos;s see if I understand what you are saying:</p><p>&gt; The Bohlen-Pierce Lambda scale is:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; 1/1 25/21 9/7 7/5 5/3 9/5 15/7 7/3 25/9 3/1<br/>&gt;</p><p>(follows: table of all the cyclic re-arrangements of the steps<br/>of the scale to nearest cents)</p><p>&gt;<br/>&gt; Generalized this as a [5,4] scale (where P = 1:3) allows for some<br/>&gt; interesting weighted Tribonacci interpretations.</p><p>I.e. the steps are approximately of two sizes, 5 small and 4 large:</p><p>steps: 25/21 27/25 49/45 25/21 27/25 25/21 49/45 25/21 27/25<br/>where 49/45 ~= 27/25, (using ~= for approximately equal)<br/>i.e.<br/>L S S L S L S L S<br/>= 5 * S and 4 * L.<br/>L/S ~=  log(25/21)/log(49/45) ~= 2</p><p>So one can approximate it as the steps<br/>2 1 1 2 1 2 1 2 1<br/>in 13 equal divisions of 3/1.</p><p>This is an ordinary Myhill scale - i.e. each interval class has two interval sizes.</p><p>(E.g. the 3 step intervals are either L S S or  L S L)</p><p>Looking at the results in SCALA, the interval classes 2 and 7 are the ones<br/>which have an interval with a single incidence, and the other intervals<br/>are generators.</p><p>(For newbies to this topic:) that is by the standard result for Myhill scales:<br/>2 is relatively prime with 9 (the number of notes in the scale), so the<br/>two step intervals make a cycle of intervals that span the scale, and if<br/>only one of them is left out, the cycle is broken, but the remaining intervals<br/>still span the scale.</p><p>They are 3^(3/13) , which is 438.913 cents, and 3^(10/13).

One thing to perhaps note here<br/>is that adjacent fractions of any GCD reduced [a,b] index will always<br/>give the generator within a given periodicity (P). And when a chain of<br/>these generators that is (a+b)-1 long  results in a built-in ordering<br/>rule. This is why I&apos;ve felt that some three-term analogue to adjacent<br/>fractions is what&apos;s really needed to completely generalize Trihill<br/>scales. This seems to be a very difficult problem though, and as no<br/>one I asked was able to help, I went about looking for some alternate<br/>ways to go about tackling the problem.</p><p>What I did was to simply take the single generator model</p><p>1/1---3/2</p><p>and convert it into a generalized take on your initial two generator<br/>hunch</p><p>   5/4<br/>   / \<br/>  /   \<br/>1/1---3/2</p><p>by collapsing a single generator chain on itself:</p><p>8192/6561<br/>   / \<br/>  /   \<br/>1/1---3/2</p><p>And if limited to scales with an odd number of tones this works like a<br/>charm. Different weightings of the adjacent fractions can be used to<br/>optimize most anything you&apos;d like. I tend to like clear delineation in<br/>an [a,b,c] index -- in other words a real practical sense of<br/>three-stepsize cardinality.</p><p>&lt;&lt; Your method also uses alternating generators, but I don&apos;t see how<br/>you obtain them. Can you explain? &gt;&gt;</p><p>Looking at a two-term generator as a generalized fifth in a circle (or<br/>spiral, or whatever) of fifths really helps, because if you multiply<br/>it (I&apos;ll call &quot;it&quot;, the generator, X) by the forth term of the<br/>two-term/Fibonacci index, then the difference between this and P<br/>(whatever your given periodicity is) will result in what I&apos;d call a<br/>generalized Pythagorean comma.</p><p>If P = 1:3 and your [a,b] index is [5,4], then if you multiply the<br/>converted [a,b,c] generator by the weighted constant of 2.5 you get<br/>the generalized Pythagorean comma of 1:3^(1/30).</p><p>Now if you look at the last example I gave in the &quot;two-dimensional<br/>three-term BP scales&quot; post, the three-term index of [1,4,4] gives a<br/>Tribonacci series of</p><p>1, 4, 4, 9, 17, 30, ...</p><p>So the single generator model is converted into the generalized take<br/>on your initial two generator hunch by collapsing a single generator<br/>chain on itself, and</p><p>0---23---16---9---2---25---18---11---4</p><p>becomes</p><p>  26----19----12-----5<br/>  / \   / \   / \   / \<br/> /   \ /   \ /   \ /   \<br/>0----23----16-----9-----2</p><p>(BTW, this is also the three-term Fibonacci to Tribonacci Yasser<br/>parallel that Paul Erlich initially posted about way back when.)</p><p>&lt;&lt; have I followed you correctly as far as I got? &gt;&gt;</p><p>Yes I think so, but please do ask questions if any of the rest of it<br/>is still unclear.</p><p>thanks,</p><p>--Dan Stearns</p></div>
