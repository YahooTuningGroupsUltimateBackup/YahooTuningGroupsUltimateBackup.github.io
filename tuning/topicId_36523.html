It seems that the two reviewers didn&apos;t<br/>&gt; agree with what he had to say on Pythagorean tunings and early music for<br/>&gt; voices. Bach was also discussed.</p><p>Oh, I heard it.  Yes, they did bring up the inaccuracies.  They actually<br/>mentioned most of the objections that came up here.  And they were more<br/>dismissive of his writing style than the reviews I read.  They suggested<br/>it might have been intended for children, but you wouldn&apos;t want children<br/>reading it because of the inaccuracies.</p><p>As to Bach, they did point out that the 48 were written for well, rather<br/>than equal temperament.  This is the first time I&apos;ve heard the distinction<br/>made on Radio 3.  And they criticised the book for not giving much<br/>attention to well temperaments.</p><p>However, the introduction, where they played the introduction to the 48 on<br/>different harpsichords, didn&apos;t include Werckmeister.  Also when they<br/>played the 1/4 comma meantone in a &quot;good&quot; key, the final arpeggio was so<br/>slow that it didn&apos;t work as a chord, leaving no examples at all of the<br/>pure 1/4-comma triads.  There was also a bizarre comment about Pythagorean<br/>intonation having perfectly tuned thirds (surprisingly similar to one of<br/>Vicentino&apos;s comments, BTW).  Unfortunately my ear wasn&apos;t well enough<br/>polished enough to tell if it was really JI or what was going on.</p><p>&gt; I&apos;ve just emailed the BBC to ask if they have a transcript or tape of<br/>&gt; the broadcast because my gut feeling is that the reviewers&apos; expertise in<br/>&gt; the field is probably as suspect as Isacoff&apos;s. I&apos;m bearing in mind the<br/>&gt; heavy traffic we had a few weeks back on the matter. S&apos;about time I read<br/>&gt; the book - it&apos;s all over the place.</p><p>Roderick Swanson was it?  He seemed to be some kind of expert, although I<br/>think it was him who made the comment about perfect thirds in Pythagorean<br/>tuning mentioned above.  The other chap was a regular musician, and so<br/>closer to the target audience.</p><p>Some time ago (I think last year) there was a demonstration of harpsichord<br/>tunings as an interval feature in a Bach concert.  I thought that was<br/>poor, although didn&apos;t mention it at the time.  They completely ignored the<br/>well temperaments, and made a few comments about Bach using equal<br/>temperament.  Also no mention of split keys for meantone.  But worst, they<br/>blithely gave an example of how bad meantone sounds in a remote key<br/>without saying that, when meantone was in fashion, nobody used those<br/>remote keys.  So it gave the impression that until equal temperament was<br/>discovered, people had to put up with music being out of tune.</p><p>I mention this now because yesterday&apos;s feature did head down the same<br/>path, but in the review they redeemed themselves.  In fact, I wonder if<br/>the introduction could have been an edited version of that interval<br/>feature.</p><p>And another thing...  On Saturday&apos;s CD Review, they played a piece of<br/>harpsichord music and the prat of a presenter complained both before an<br/>after how difficult the tuning was to get used to.  Sounded like 1/4-comma<br/>meantone to me.</p><p>&gt; And some of you guys should take time out to write a more definitive and<br/>&gt; accurate account than Isacoff&apos;s would seem to be. If I tell you that<br/>&gt; words to the effect of &apos;blinkered New Jersey outlook&apos; were used, perhaps<br/>&gt; that might inspire you to get on BBC Radio 3 and level things<br/>&gt; out........I&apos;ll keep y&apos;all posted if I get a reply from the BEEB. Stay<br/>&gt; cool.</p><p>One thing that struck me about the review is that they could easily have<br/>done a web search as research and turned up Kyle Gann&apos;s review, maybe even<br/>some Tuning List posts.  In fact, I think they did exactly that.  The only<br/>alternative would be if the objections raised here are obviously correct<br/>;)</p><p>Yes, there was something about New Jersey although I don&apos;t remember the<br/>word &quot;blinkered&quot; being used.  They were suggesting he had a parochial<br/>attitude, but the word &quot;parochial&quot; wasn&apos;t used either.  Could have been<br/>thinly veiled anti-Americanism.</p><p>                   Graham</p></div><h3><a id=36541 href="#36541">ðŸ”—</a>Afmmjr@aol.com</h3><span>4/22/2002 5:58:59 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Allison:</p><p>&gt; &gt; And some of you guys should take time out to write a more definitive and<br/>&gt; &gt; accurate account than Isacoff&apos;s would seem to be.
