I haven&apos;t made up my<br/>mind how to reconcile &apos;jazz harmony&apos;, which seems to me like the full<br/>realization of 12tet harmony, with where I want to go with extended<br/>harmonic materials and I can&apos;t help you with tools. Welcome!</p><p>&gt;One radical example iM-4ve been using as a pianist for a while,which usually<br/>&gt;puts confusion in the mind of people when i play it,is a 12tet chord thatM-4s<br/>&gt;undoubtley tritave-based!From bottom to top,the notes are(in C):</p><p>&gt;C E Bb Eb G B</p><p>Does it have the same quality to you when you voice it more as</p><p>Bmaj7<br/>-----        =  C E G B D# (F#) A# ?<br/>Cmaj7</p><p>Just curious. I like that sort of sound as well as endlessly stacking<br/>major triads</p><p>C E G B D F# A C# E G# B etc...</p><p>although I never really thought of the tritave orientation in those<br/>terms.</p><p>Of course, once you are out of 12tet, those sharps and flats become important.<br/>I have a soundcard with tuning tables and can try limited 12-out-of-N<br/>experiments, and this looks like another good one. (In 31, the sharps are<br/>lower than the flats and result in &apos;septimal&apos; intervals).</p><p>Bob Valentine</p></div>
