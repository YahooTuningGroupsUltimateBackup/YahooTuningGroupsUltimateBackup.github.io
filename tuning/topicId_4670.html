I was<br/>&gt; surprised but probably shouldn&apos;t have been.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Bob Valentine</p><p>Bob brings up a point which has interested me for years:  What makes a<br/>tuning system sound distinctly microtonal versus out of tune?  Alternately,<br/>what makes a tuning system sound microtonal and not just more in tune?  I<br/>have experimented with dozens of systems trying to come up with something<br/>that sounds &quot;new&quot;.</p><p>Examples:</p><p>The Bartok violin concerto with the quartertones, the quartertones are<br/>hardly noticeable.  (but nice if you are paying really close attention)<br/>What&apos;s the point?  Just more work for the performer?</p><p>Robert Fripp&apos;s Johnny One Note solo on &quot;Starless&quot; kicks butt microtonally,<br/>and he&apos;s playing a 12TET instrument.</p><p>Ives quarter tone piano pieces sound microtonal, but mostly because he plays<br/>recognizable melodies and transposes them by quarter tones.</p><p>Partch&apos;s music finds new consonances, and not just new dissonances or weird<br/>sounds.  He also has melodies with very small microtonal steps in them.<br/>(Think about some of the harmonic cannon lines)  To me his music covers the<br/>gamut from more out of tune, to more in tune, to new and distinctly<br/>microtonal.</p><p>Most Indian music regularly uses notes 16 cents away from 12TET, and it&apos;s<br/>played over a drone, yet it usually doesn&apos;t sound microtonal.  It just<br/>sounds right, or in tune.</p><p>Why?</p><p>Jon Catler recently had me cut a neck for him where we added 7-limit Just<br/>frets to a 12TET guitar neck.  That sounded new and microtonal.  Maybe<br/>because of the strength of the 5-limit 12TET system against the purity of<br/>the occasional 7-limit JI note?</p><p>---<br/>Glen Peterson<br/>30 Elm Street North Andover, MA 01845<br/>(978) 975-1527<br/><a href="http://www.OrganicDesign.org/Glen/Instruments">http://www.OrganicDesign.org/Glen/Instruments</a></p></div><h3><a id=4705 href="#4705">ðŸ”—</a>Rick McGowan &#x3C;rmcgowan@xxxxx.xxxx&#x3E;</h3><span>9/7/1999 10:06:23 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>&gt; Every Society gets the Art that they Deserve-Mark Twain</p><p>... while the good stuff is archived for their grand-children.</p></div>
