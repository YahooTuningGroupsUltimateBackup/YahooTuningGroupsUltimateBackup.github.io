Bill, we know you at least *post* to the list, so here is another bouquet for some of the most beautiful new microtonal music being done...<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; ...and WHEN will we be able to get a recording of some of your latest music??? :)<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Cheers,<br/>&gt; Jon<br/>&gt;</p><p>Thirded. Bills music is some of the nicest I&apos;ve heard of anybody<br/>anywhere, I like his writings too, and it was nice to see his name<br/>again on the list. (I let my subscription to PNM lapse years ago,<br/>along with CMJ, but I&apos;ll search out the mentioned issue).</p><p>Bill, WHEN will we be able to get a recording of some of<br/>your latest music?</p><p>Bob Valentine</p></div>
