In particular, check out the tutorials. The<br/>recommendation of BBedit comes from the fact that it is a text-only (ascii)<br/>editor and Csound requires text files. You can use any word processor *as<br/>long as you save the .sco and .orc files as text only*. I have used Word<br/>and AppleWorks. There is another book on computer music through Csound that<br/>is a step-by-step approach rather than a collection of essays like the<br/>Boulanger Csound Book. It is _Virtual Sound_ by Riccardo Bianchini and<br/>Alessandro Cipriani and it is available here:<br/><a href="http://www.cdemusic.org/store/cde_search.cfm?keywords=aciprianicds">http://www.cdemusic.org/store/cde_search.cfm?keywords=aciprianicds</a>.<br/>However, I think that you will find the Boulanger book valuable if only for<br/>the hundreds of examples on CD-ROM. Best of luck, and let me know if you<br/>have other questions.</p><p>Bill</p><p>&gt;            I just bought a copy of the C Sound Book by Richard<br/>&gt;Boulanger which claims to offer something for beginners.

The complaint about Csound<br/>seems to be mainly about its user interface. I acknowledge<br/>these but find they pale into insignificance when I remind<br/>myself that this software is the aggregation of the<br/>experience of many composers who produced the first computer<br/>music. These like Partch were proactive in building their<br/>own instruments except they did so using software. Moreover,<br/>Barry Vercoe, the composer who wrote Csound, and several<br/>other synthesis languages before that, has generously made<br/>it available by releasing the source code in the public<br/>domain thereby creating an enormous community of creative<br/>enthusiasts. Many of these are composers who have since<br/>contributed to its development in order to develop their own<br/>creative work.</p><p>It&apos;s a bit like Harry Partch (or Kraig Grady or Ron George<br/>or Bill Wesley) building their instruments and then giving<br/>them away so everyone can benefit from their ideas. Imagine<br/>if one of these guys gave you one of their instruments as a<br/>gift -- a gift that represented their own unique commitment<br/>to composing music -- and your only response was &quot;it&apos;s too<br/>complicated. I can&apos;t use it. But please fix it for me so I<br/>too can use it&quot;. I sure know how I&apos;d feel! (Boulez meets<br/>Harry !#@#!) ouch!</p><p>One of the Csound community is Bill Alves who has politely<br/>directed interested parties to the Csound list. However even<br/>this will not make the problem go away. While generic<br/>technology on which Csound is supposed to run is in a<br/>constant state of flux, users must to be prepared to develop<br/>an understanding of technical problems. Above all people<br/>need to develop a healthy scepticism about glib assertions<br/>that something or other is simple to install or easy to use.<br/>This is the sort of snake oil that&apos;s freely available on the<br/>internet. I think unrealistic expectations among novice<br/>users (myself included) is possibly the main cause of Csound<br/>problems. And while some help can be offered on the Csound<br/>list, the most valuable source of help for starting Csound<br/>is sometimes a computer literate friend who is willing to<br/>spend a half an hour setting up user preferences. This is<br/>the best option if you don&apos;t want to, as Jon Szanto so aptly<br/>puts it, &quot;fart around with batch files, path environments,<br/>and all that&quot;. A musician needs to spend time doing<br/>something productive.</p><p>Curiously enough the use of a generic text-editor doesn&apos;t<br/>seem to stop users on this list from spending hours upon<br/>hours producing email. Yet the time spent doing that might<br/>otherwise be spent learning from the dozens upon dozens of<br/>text examples supplied by Richard Boulanger in the Csound<br/>book. You&apos;ll be amazed how playing with these using only<br/>cut-and-paste in a generic text editor can be quite<br/>satisfying. Not quite as seductive as doing email, but<br/>satisfying nonetheless and a far more useful investment of a<br/>musician&apos;s time. Only by doing this will Csound users<br/>develop a basic understanding of these tools in the same way<br/>that the skills of violin playing are learned.

Yet the time spent doing that might<br/>&gt; otherwise be spent learning from the dozens upon dozens of<br/>&gt; text examples supplied by Richard Boulanger in the Csound<br/>&gt; book. You&apos;ll be amazed how playing with these using only<br/>&gt; cut-and-paste in a generic text editor can be quite<br/>&gt; satisfying. Not quite as seductive as doing email, but<br/>&gt; satisfying nonetheless and a far more useful investment of a<br/>&gt; musician&apos;s time.</p><p>Thanks for your opinion, Greg.  However, I have to say that the time<br/>I have spent on this list has totally revolutionized my way of<br/>thinking about music.

Much of what<br/>you say makes great sense, and I think that my original post about<br/>UIs could easily be read to mean a devaluation of Csound as a whole.<br/>This was not my intention whatsoever.</p><p>It is not *mandatory* that anything else be supplied for Csound, as<br/>with proper setup (I know, since I was able to make it happen) it<br/>does exactly what it says it will. But I&apos;ve watched in frustration as<br/>others banged their heads, and I believe that it is not a &quot;dumbing<br/>down&quot; of such good work to make it easier to use. You still will have<br/>to write your code (scores and orchs), but every moment of time saved<br/>elsewhere plows back into musical exploration.</p><p>--- In tuning@y..., &quot;Greg Schiemer&quot; &lt;gregs@c...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt; The problem people have with Csound is not a problem with<br/>&gt; Csound per se but largely a problem of perception created<br/>&gt; among users of the internet.
