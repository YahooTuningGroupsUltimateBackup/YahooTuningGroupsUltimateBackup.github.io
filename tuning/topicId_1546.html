My second-favorite minor 7th chord<br/>&gt;is 12:14:18:21. Each of these minor seventh chords has all six intervals<br/>&gt;within the 9-limit, and yet neither one is a subset of a 9-limit<br/>&gt;otonality or utonality. I discoved this last year...</p><p>Oh come on guys, this isn&apos;t rocket science!  &quot;Discovered last year&quot;!  These<br/>are two of the most basic 7-limit compound chords there are.  I dicuss them<br/>both in my review of the Justonic Pitch Palette (October 97), and they were<br/>known to me 6 months before that.  Monzo said the 10-12-15-18 is the basic<br/>5-limit minor 7th chord, and it is, and was no doubt known to Ellis.<br/>Graham&apos;s stuff is equally trite; nobody forgot these chords, they are<br/>obvious to anybody who has ever played with harmonic series segments or<br/>followed the standard stack-fifths routine...</p><p>Carl</p></div><h3><a id=1556 href="#1556">ðŸ”—</a>Kraig Grady &#x3C;kraiggrady@xxxxxxxxx.xxxx&#x3E;</h3><span>3/12/1999 10:07:12 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Carl Lumma wrote:</p><p>&gt;   Monzo said the 10-12-15-18 is the basic<br/>&gt; 5-limit minor 7th chord, and it is, and was no doubt known to Ellis.<br/>&gt; Graham&apos;s stuff is equally trite; nobody forgot these chords, they are<br/>&gt; obvious to anybody who has ever played with harmonic series segments or<br/>&gt; followed the standard stack-fifths routine...<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Carl</p><p>All of these chords are in Helmholtz books.
