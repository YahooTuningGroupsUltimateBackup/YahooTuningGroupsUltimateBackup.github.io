The meantone hexachord is a 6-tone MOS whose generator is the meantone, and a hexachord one meantone away will share five notes, two away four notes, and so forth. Hence movement by a major third (two meantones) is quite natural, and 7/5 (three meantones) and 7/4 (five meantones) also work.</p></div><h3>paulerlich &#x3C;paul@stretch-music.com&#x3E;</h3><span>1/15/2002 2:04:14 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In tuning@y..., &quot;genewardsmith&quot; &lt;genewardsmith@j...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt; I found a unqiue 6-tone 9-limit chord/scale for the 31 et, which<br/>&gt;turns out to be a general feature of the standard septimal meantone<br/>&gt;temperament; this is the meantone in which both 81/80 *and* 126/125<br/>&gt; (and hence 225/224 = (81/80)/(126/125)) are commas.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; One mode of it is [0, 5, 10, 15, 21, 26] with steps 555655 in the<br/>&gt;31 et, but it also has versions in 12, 19, 31, 43, 50 and 74.
