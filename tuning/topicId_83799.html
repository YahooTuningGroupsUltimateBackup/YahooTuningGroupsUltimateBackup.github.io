I **tried to insert at least one diagram but it didn&acute;t work. Let me **suggest you to confirm your e-mail address &lt;<a href="mailto:yahya@yahoogroups.com">yahya@yahoogroups.com</a>&gt; **or &lt;yahya@...&gt;. Diagrams and additional information can be **sent you via your alternate e-mail address. My e-mail address **follows:</p><p>**&lt;piagui@...&gt;.</p><p>My name: Mario Pizarro; Electronic Engineer,</p><p>**physicist, mathematician. Age: 75.</p><p>**Agree, just a message can&acute;t give sufficient information. Now you **will have more and I will be pleased to give more details if we **keep in contact. This matter that took me more than 20 years **deserves to be examined by learned persons like you.</p><p>About your questions:</p><p>**Once you get basic/detailed information on the Piagui musical scale<br/>**and its fundamental principles as well as the new developed **sources used to get this system you might conclude that this **matter deserves to be part of the physics science.</p><p>-- What is a chord wave?<br/>If we take a pure sinusoid (no overtones)whose frequency is f1 we can depict this wave on an XY coordinates starting with the wave zero amplitude or origin at the positive going of line.<br/>A second sinusoid with f2 frequency is placed on the diagram and again its positive going origin (Y = 0) coincides with the former wave origin which also coincides with the XY origin.</p><p>Similarly, a third sinusoid with a f3 frequency is placed in the diagram. Each wave represents a triad tone and these three sinusoidal  vaves are added. It is evident that the total wave is not a sinusoidal variation; the combined wave shape formed by three audio-frequencies show a darkened area near the abscisa axis, however at higher positive and negative amplitudes appear positive and negative peaks which are not producing darkened areas and these data gave important information regarding the triad harmony. It was necessary to transform the useful peaks of the combined wave (CHORD WAVE) to point marks (CHORD WAVE PEAKS)by using a suitable software.</p><p>-- What is an e-tempered chord wave?<br/>The preceding paragraph explains how a CHORD WAVE is displayed. The type of the three sinusoidal components (f1, f2, f3) was not specified. When the three wave triad components correspond to the e-tempered scale then we have an e-tempered chord wave.</p><p>-- What is a Piagui chord wave?<br/>The preceding lines answer your question for in this case the three combined sinusoids are tone frequencies of the Piagui scale system. I said system because it offers three optimal scales.</p><p>-- What is an h, H and 0 discrepancy?<br/>In my book I explain these parameters. Below I give one example.</p><p>NOTE.... PIAGUI I .......E.TEMPERED....DISCREPANCY %<br/>D....... 294.3287 Hz.....293.6648 Hz... + 0.226 %</p><p>According to the relative discrepancy magnitude it is classified with the h, H, 0 figures to compare the triad tone discrepancies.</p><p>I would be pleased to give you more information and hope to get your full e-mail address to send you the graphs.</p><p>Regards</p><p>Mario Pizarro</p><p>piagui@...</p><p>Lima, June 02, 2009</p></div><h3>martinsj013 &#x3C;martinsj@...&#x3E;</h3><span>6/2/2009 2:17:34 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;piaguiscale&quot; &lt;piagui@...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt; ** As you know it is not possible to post diagrams via tuning.
