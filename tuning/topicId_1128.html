If you want scale steps closer in size to a semitone, you<br/>have<br/>&gt;to orient yourself more along the 5-axis.  Hence the three-tetrachord<br/>&gt;technique that I described some time back, which delimits the<br/>&gt;tetrachords with 5:4s instead of 4:3s.</p><p>Remind me -- what is the technique you described, and what are the<br/>scales in question? I recently mentioned the idea of three identical<br/>5:4-delimited blocks in connection with the 22-out-of-41 scale.</p></div>
