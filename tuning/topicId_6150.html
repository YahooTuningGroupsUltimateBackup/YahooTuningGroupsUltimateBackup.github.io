Based on<br/>&gt; anyone&apos;s aural observations, should I include 9-limit?</p><p>I haven&apos;t made a systematic study of this, partly because I don&apos;t really<br/>understand the question.  However, I have made some observations.</p><p>Firstly, when working out a tuning for my guitar, I tried to work out the<br/>flattest meantone fifth where the 4:6:9 chord still sounded okay.  The<br/>chord is two stacked fifths, so the most complex (and out-of-tune)<br/>interval is the 4:9.</p><p>I concluded it got bad somewhere between 1/4-comma meantone and the golden<br/>meantone.  The change was so abrupt, I ascribed it to moving past a tuning<br/>step on my synthesizer, so the 4:9 became another cent out of tune.<br/>Anyway, that gives a threshold for 4:9 sounding &quot;okay&quot; at between 10.3 and<br/>10.8 cents.  This is over precise -- say it gets bad at around 11 cents.<br/>As this is in the same region as your figures, I wonder if there&apos;s a<br/>connection.</p><p>The other thing is that, after a fair amount of experience with 31-equal,<br/>I&apos;ve decided it isn&apos;t good enough in the 7-limit.  It works great in the<br/>5-limit.  I think it&apos;s around the optimum mistuning (yes, beats can be<br/>good).  But in the 7-limit, although all intervals are clearly<br/>recognizable, I&apos;ve found it difficult to get strong consonances.</p><p>The same is true of my near-Pythagorean schismic tuning.  However, using a<br/>schismic tuning where 4:7 is just, all of a sudden the 7-limit consonances<br/>become a lot more stable.  I think this is another artificial threshold on<br/>the synth, but I haven&apos;t worked out which intervals are affected.</p><p>To put numbers on it: for 4:7 just, the worst interval is 3:5 at 4.3<br/>cents.  (The worst interval of 7 is 5:7 at 4.1 cents.)  For Pythagorean<br/>schismic, the 5:7 is 5.8 cents out of tune.  So, let&apos;s say for 7-limit<br/>chords to be highly consonant, all intervals should be nearer than 5 cents<br/>to JI, ideally 4 cents or even less.</p><p>The worst 5-limit intervals in 31= are about 6 cents out, and I think this<br/>is some kind of optimum.  If mistuning it inversely proportional to the<br/>limit, we get</p><p> 3-limit  10.0 cents<br/> 5-limit   6.0 cents<br/> 7-limit   4.3 cents<br/> 9-limit   3.3 cents<br/>11-limit   2.7 cents<br/>13-limit   2.3 cents</p><p>for optimum tuning of the worst intervals.  The 7-limit agreement is<br/>remarkable, and probably coincidental.  10 cent flat fifths sound a bit<br/>much to me.</p><p>A 9-limit complete chord contains more 5-limit intervals than a 7-limit<br/>complete chord.  So, it may break the pattern in that more deviation is<br/>allowed.  Another complication is that sharp intervals are probably more<br/>acceptable than flat ones.</p><p>For more on schismic temperament, see<br/><a href="http://www.microtonal.co.uk/schismic.htm">http://www.microtonal.co.uk/schismic.htm</a></p></div><h3>Glen Peterson &#x3C;Glen@xxxxxxxxxxxxx.xxxx&#x3E;</h3><span>11/12/1999 6:02:15 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>&gt; from Paul:<br/>&gt; See <a href="http://www.ixpres.com/interval/td/entropy.htm">http://www.ixpres.com/interval/td/entropy.htm</a>, which contains a<br/>&gt; compilation of my postings to the list on the subject.</p><p>Thanks!

So as I agree with you when you say that you can&apos;t<br/>really put strict boundaries on an intervals field of pull, or range<br/>of distinction, I guess I&apos;d have to say that I saw it as a simple way<br/>to put some actual numbers on something along the lines of Partch&apos;s<br/>observation one...

The most likely<br/>interpretations are 7:6 up to 286 cents, 13:11 from 287 to 292 cents, and<br/>6:5 from 293 cents up. The harmonic entropy reaches a local minimum at 273<br/>cents, a local maximum at 283 cents, and another local minimum at 315 cents.<br/>So in the entire 13:11 region one is being &quot;pulled&quot; toward 6:5 by the strong<br/>gravitation of the latter.</p><p>Then I tried a standard deviation of 0.6%, that of the most accurate<br/>listener in Goldstein&apos;s experiment. The most likely interpretations are<br/>15:13 up to 252 cents, 7:6 from 253 to 281 cents, 13:11 from 282 to 297<br/>cents, 19:16 from 298 to 299 cents, 6:5 from 300 to 331 cents, and 17:14<br/>from 332 cents up. The harmonic entropy had a local minimum at 268 cents, a<br/>local maximum at 290 cents, and another local minimum at 315 cents. So in<br/>this case the 13:11 region, which is larger than before, is divided into a<br/>region that is pulled toward 7:6 and a region that is pulled toward 6:5.</p><p>Interestingly, in either case 13:11 is not a point of stability but a point<br/>of relative instability.</p><p>I repeated the study with a Farey series of order 150. Using a 1% standard<br/>deviation, the borders were the same as with order 100, the local minima<br/>were at 273 and 318 cents, and the local maximum was at 286 cents. Using a<br/>0.6% standard deviation, the borders are the same as with order 100 (except<br/>that 13:11 takes over 298 cents from 19:16, leaving the latter as the most<br/>likely interpretation only at 299 cents), the local minima were at 268 cents<br/>and 316 cents, and the local maximum was at 291 cents.</p><p>So, thankfully, the results do not change significantly when increasing the<br/>Farey order from 100 to 150.</p></div><h3>D.Stearns &#x3C;stearns@xxxxxxx.xxxx&#x3E;</h3><span>11/16/1999 11:55:14 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>[Paul H.

Erlich &#x3C;PErlich@xxxxxxxxxxxxx.xxxx&#x3E;</h3><span>11/16/1999 4:25:36 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Thanks, Daniel. There are many differences between Barlow&apos;s idea and<br/>harmonic entropy. Harmonic entropy makes no reference to a scale, referring<br/>instead to a simultaneous dyad presented with no musical context. I don&apos;t<br/>even agree with Barlow that there is a &quot;182 cent major second between the<br/>second and third degrees of a major scale&quot; -- since even the strictest of<br/>strict JI advocates would lower the second degree to 204 cents below the<br/>third degree when the second degree is used in a subdominant function. In<br/>fact, I see no evidence that melodic seconds or thirds in a scale<br/>automatically get interpreted in terms of simple ratios -- if they did, how<br/>could one explain the wide variety of values they take in the world&apos;s<br/>scales?</p><p>Besides these qualitative differences, note that harmonic entropy really<br/>only has one &quot;arbitrary&quot; parameter -- the standard deviation -- while Barlow<br/>is discussing &quot;1. the deviation of the imagined pitch from the given one&quot;,<br/>&quot;2. the contraction or expansion of the steps in the scale resulting from<br/>the aforesaid stretch of the imagination&quot;, 3. an arbitrary prime weighting<br/>scheme.</p><p>Note that harmonic entropy starts with no assumptions about simple ratios<br/>being more important that complex ratios. The attraction to simple ratios<br/>comes out of the harmonic entropy calculations simply because, for any Farey<br/>order (i.e. integer limit), the simple ratios have no near neighbor ratios<br/>while the complex ratios have many. So even if _a priori_ we can recognize<br/>ratios of arbitrary complexity (which is what the harmonic entropy model<br/>assumes), the imprecision of our hearing mechanism will spread any stimulus<br/>over a finite range in interval space. If the true interval is near a simple<br/>ratio, there won&apos;t be much confusion as to which ratio is heard; otherwise,<br/>many ratios will be included within the &quot;smear&quot; and the listener is<br/>confused. Harmonic entropy models dissonance with a mathematical measure of<br/>this confusion, namely the entropy of the set of probabilities associated<br/>with the proportion of the &quot;smear&quot; that is assigned to the various ratios.<br/>Entropy is the natural measure for disorder and also for informational<br/>complexity.</p><p>Now it may be that simple ratios _are_ more important even apart from the<br/>&quot;smearing&quot;, in which case harmonic entropy gives too much importance to<br/>complex ratios. Using a standard deviation of 0.6% is also quite ideal; even<br/>the best listener in Goldstein&apos;s experiment only acheived this accuracy in<br/>at some optimal frequency (was it 2000Hz) and did worse than 2% in other<br/>musically relevant areas. So the results I presented were absolutely the<br/>best-case scenario for perceiving complex ratios, aside from<br/>combination-tone effects. I think this is an important exercise before<br/>plunging into the endless array of ratios that are our disposal for<br/>constructing JI systems or evaluating tempered systems.</p></div><h3>Paul H.

But unless considered in a particular context, I can&apos;t<br/>&gt;ascribe much importance to a single interval,</p><p>Important or not, a single interval will evoke a sensation involving a<br/>greater or lesser degree of &quot;blending&quot;, and harmonic entropy is one model<br/>for explaining this.</p><p>&gt;and Barlough seems to be the<br/>&gt;first to propose some criteria for evaluating such a context.</p><p>If that context is a melodic scale, I object to Barlow&apos;s view of the scale<br/>as implying a single, immutable set of ratios. If not, can you explain?</p><p>&gt;Your argument makes a strange circle here. Any given limit is an assumption</p><p>&gt;of greater importance for simpler ratios in that the limit is (a) a limit</p><p>Good point! Though if I include all ratios of numbers up to 200, isn&apos;t the<br/>fact that you only get local minima around, say, 11-odd-limit ratios<br/>significant? Isn&apos;t the fact that, even though 63:50 and dozens of other<br/>ratios closer to 400 cents are included in the model on an equal footing<br/>with 5:4, the model still says we&apos;re most likely to hear 400 cents as 5:4,<br/>significant?</p><p>&gt;and<br/>&gt;(b) the distribution of prime factors in any given octave will be biased<br/>&gt;towards the lower factors.</p><p>I don&apos;t know what you mean. Prime factors have nothing to do with either the<br/>premises or the results of the harmonic entropy model.</p><p>&gt;While the<br/>&gt;entropy idea may have no such assumption in itself,  by using the Farey<br/>&gt;series for your calculations you are are stuck with this bias.</p><p>I agree that there is some bias, but there are general features of the<br/>harmonic entropy curves that seem fairly constant over Farey series of<br/>various orders, series defined with the sum of the numberator and<br/>denominator less that various constants, and probably some of the<br/>alternatives we&apos;ve discussed on this list that I haven&apos;t been able to try<br/>yet.</p><p>&gt;I don&apos;t happen<br/>&gt;to disagree with the results, but you won&apos;t get a significantly different<br/>&gt;answer by taking a set similar to that chosen by Barlow.</p><p>I&apos;ll put that to the test. But first there&apos;s a question we have to answer.<br/>In the Farey and other sets I&apos;d consider, the ratios are delimited by the<br/>mediants (or freshman sums), which are simply the first fractions which<br/>would come between the ratios as the Farey (or other) order is increased.<br/>That would not be the case for Barlow&apos;s set. Although the mediant between<br/>two of Barlow&apos;s fractions may have a very high prime limit, it would not be<br/>a part of a &quot;Barlow set&quot; of slightly increased order, which would conform<br/>instead to a prime limit of 13 or 17. If we can come up with a definition of<br/>Barlow set that is defined on a single &quot;order&quot; (or complexity) parameter,<br/>then we can systematically (but with more difficulty that simply taking the<br/>freshman sum) delimit the ratios and process to calculate entropies. The<br/>naive suspicion is that these will show local minima at ratios with higher<br/>numbers but low prime factors (like 15:8 and 27:16), while my preferred<br/>models do not.</p><p>&gt;This &quot;confusion&quot; doesn&apos;t conform to any real listening experience I&apos;ve ever</p><p>&gt;had. In experimental settings -- my work with all those minor thirds last<br/>&gt;year, for example -- the length of the listening period was everything in<br/>&gt;sorting out a series of intervals.  My sensation in analysing an interval<br/>&gt;over time is not that I am sorting through a smear of possible identities<br/>but<br/>&gt;rather that a single identity is gradually speaking, and that identity is<br/>not<br/>&gt;isolated from beating or difference tones.</p><p>Let me quote the first two paragraphs of the conclusion of the article<br/>&quot;Vision: A Window on Consciousness&quot; in the Nov. &apos;99 _Scientific American_:</p><p>&#x9;&quot;What do these findings reveal about visual awareness? First, they<br/>show that we are unaware of a great deal of activity in our brains. We have<br/>long known that we are mostly unaware of the activity in the brain that<br/>maintains the body in a stable state--one of its evolutionarily most ancient<br/>tasks. Our experiments show that we are also unaware of much of the neural<br/>activity that generates--at least in part--our conscious experiences.<br/>&#x9;&quot;We can say this because many neurons in our brains respond to<br/>stimuli that we are not conscious of. Only a tiny fraction of neurons seem<br/>to be plausible candidates for what physiologists call the &apos;neural<br/>correlate&apos; of conscious perception--that is, they respond in a manner that<br/>reliably reflects perception&quot;</p><p>What I&apos;m suggesting is that the confusion exists on a neural level (which is<br/>why an informational approach such as entropy is appropriate) but the many<br/>stages of neural processing between the sense perception and the conscious<br/>experience serve to provide the illusion that our experience is in most<br/>respects clear and distinct. It may be that one is only conscious in a<br/>general sense of the difficulty with which this neural processing occurs,<br/>and that that contributes to the sensation we call &quot;dissonance&quot; -- this is<br/>one interpretation of the harmonic entropy model. Nevertheless, I&apos;ve had the<br/>conscious experience of listening to a 400-cent major third and hearing it<br/>as a confusion between 5:4 (mostly) and 9:7 (less so), involving a<br/>fluctuation in time between the two, much like in the visual experiments<br/>described in this article describe a shifting perception when different<br/>patterns are presented to each eye.</p><p>What is known is that the experiments on virtual fundamental perception do<br/>indicate a range of &quot;fudging&quot; in our perception of intervals and that this<br/>range does not extend much below 0.6%. For example, with three sine waves at<br/>1100Hz, 1300Hz, and 1500Hz, subjects report agreement between the perceived<br/>fundamental and a probe tone at both 217 Hz (suggesting a 5:6:7<br/>intepretation) and at 186 Hz (suggesting a 6:7:8 interpretation) but not at<br/>other pitches. See Hall, _Musical Acoustics_ and Plomp, _Aspects of Tone<br/>Sensation_. Clearly there are at least two harmonic interpretations here, if<br/>not simultaneous at the conscious level, then quite relevant to what can be<br/>consciously perceived. Terhardt&apos;s and Parncutt&apos;s understanding of consonance<br/>includes a factor related to the degree of certainty in making these<br/>harmonic interpretations. Is that so unreasonable?</p><p>&gt;But similar to Tenney&apos;s use of entropy as a measure of variation in musical</p><p>&gt;form, or the various applications of cybernetic theory in analysis used by<br/>&gt;Franz-Jochen Herfert,  I am still left with the feeling that a power tool<br/>is<br/>&gt;being used to tackle a task that can best be done manually</p><p>Entropy is defined by an exceedingly simple function, H = -sum(p*log(p)),<br/>and I know of nothing else that could do the job. Feel free to suggest any<br/>alternatives you may think of. The actual technical derivation of the<br/>entropy function involves the following two conditions:</p><p>Continuity: H(p,1-p) is a continuous function of p</p><p>Grouping: H(p1,p2,p3,...,pM) = H(p1+p2,p3,...,pM) + (p1+<br/>p2)*H(p1/(p1+p2),p2/(p1+p2))</p><p>These are sufficient to pin down the definition of entropy. The impetus for<br/>continuity should be clear; the impetus for grouping is that it implies that<br/>splitting one possibility into two increases the entropy by an amount equal<br/>to the entropy of those two possibilities alone (as if they were the only<br/>possibilities) multiplied by the total probability represented by those two<br/>possibilites. In other words the total disorder of a system increases<br/>exactly as you would expect when you increase the disorder of a subset of<br/>the system.</p><p>&gt;I am certain that Goldstein was working with very limited sample periods</p><p>I seriously doubt his sample periods were shorter than the length of time<br/>most intervals are heard in most real music. We should check the original<br/>reference to be sure (Carl, didn&apos;t you dig this up recently)?</p><p>&gt;and<br/>&gt;a realistic evaluation of musical listening is going to have to take this<br/>&gt;into account, as well as work with timbres where beating becomes<br/>unavoidable.</p><p>Well, I have always stated that an additional component of dissonance<br/>calculations, besides harmonic entropy, should be the<br/>Helmoltz/Plomp/Sethares-type measures where interference between<br/>closely-spaced partials (beating, roughness) is summed up in some way. The<br/>former was never intended to replace the latter.</p></div><h3>Paul H.

Forgive me if something<br/>similar to this has been dealt with in the past<br/>couple of issues.</p><p>Keenan&apos;s brave and brilliant attempt to<br/>analogize the harmonic landscape and harmonic<br/>entropy has inspired me to try, once again, to<br/>understand what harmonic entropy is and what it<br/>means to music and tuning.  I think I might be<br/>starting to get it. Since I understood &quot;entropy&quot;<br/>only from high school physics, not information<br/>theory, I was trying to understand harmonic<br/>entropy in terms of wasted harmonic energy.  It<br/>seems to me now that it&apos;s really a measure of<br/>harmonic ambiguity.  Am I on the right track?<br/>This is something that happens in the human<br/>perceptual system, not merely on paper, right?<br/>And there&apos;s nothing wrong with an interval,<br/>scale, or tuning exhibiting harmonic entropy,<br/>then.  The primary usefulness of the concept is<br/>in qualifying temperaments, the primary intent<br/>of which is to approximate a certain set of low<br/>prime ratios.  The local minima are essentially<br/>what Gary Morrison used to call &quot;buoys in the<br/>the water of intonation.&quot;  Am I there yet?</p><p>--<br/>David J.

Your example just shows the<br/>mediant property. Like  in Stern-Brocot tree, starting values 0/1 and 1/0<br/>are insignificant.</p><p>I&apos;ve soon explored a triad tree which has mediant property and had surprise<br/>that mediant was also valid on IG (incremental generator) I use for showing<br/>internal numerical structure on chords. (I wrote definition of IG in post<br/>12905 and quote it in Post Scriptum). I didn&apos;t hope to find new way there.<br/>I was (as I&apos;m often) on search automatic pilot.</p><p>I got partial valid tree since minimum variations on a:b:c triad are<br/>(a-1):(b-1):(c-1) and (a+1):(b+1):(c+1). So, I tried mediant starting with<br/>3:4:5 between 2:3:4 and 4:5:6 and it was ok. As such it&apos;s nothing since<br/>it&apos;s partial. I tried IG and it was also ok. It&apos;s only there I had surprise<br/>for IG reveals why it&apos;s ok. On representation of chord  with ratios like<br/>(3:4:5) or harmonics like (1 3 5) it&apos;s not obvious.</p><p>-----------------------------------------<br/>                                    2:3:4<br/> 9:13:17<br/>           7:10:13<br/>12:17:22<br/>                     5:7:9<br/>13:18:23<br/>           8:11:14<br/>11:15:19<br/>                            3:4:5<br/>13:17:21<br/>          10:13:16<br/>17:22:27<br/>                    7:9:11<br/>18:23:28<br/>          11:14:17<br/>15:19:23<br/>                                    4:5:6<br/>-----------------------------------------</p><p> (9 13 17)<br/>             (5 7 13)<br/> (3 11 17)<br/>                        (5 7 9)<br/> (9 13 23)<br/>             (1 7 11)<br/>(11 15 19)<br/>                                 (1 3 5)<br/>(13 17 21)<br/>             (1 5 13)<br/>(11 17 27)<br/>                       (7 9 11)<br/>  (7 9 23)<br/>           (11 17 27)<br/>(15 19 23)</p><p>-----------------------------------------</p><p>However with IG representation that corresponds to mediant starting with IG<br/>11-1 between IGs 11-0 and 11-2 (but keeping order aa-b for calculation :<br/>normally, by definition, if b=2c then aa-b is reduced at most compact form<br/>cb-b.).</p><p>44-1<br/>      33-1<br/>15-5<br/>            22-1<br/>55-3<br/>      13-3<br/>44-3<br/>                  11-1<br/>44-5<br/>      23-3<br/>55-7<br/>            22-3<br/>45-5<br/>      33-5<br/>44-7</p><p>Mediant property become obvious.
