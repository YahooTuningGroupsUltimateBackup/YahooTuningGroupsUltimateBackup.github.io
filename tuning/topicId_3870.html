Could you elaborate a little?  How do you<br/>&gt; actually use CPS in your music?</p><p>There is usually some aspect of the CPS I wish to explore in each piece. Like<br/>one piece might concentrate on tetrads, another on hexanies, another on a<br/>particular pattern. In most cases I have an assumption as to what this will<br/>sound like</p><p>&gt; Do you use MOS-like melodic subsets for<br/>&gt; melody?</p><p>yes, almost all scales I use are MOS derived, but the chain of modulations<br/>seems to be a much stronger force.</p><p>&gt; Or ignore melody and just move around chords?</p><p>when  on a single chord, I draw as much melody out of it as I can. Since these<br/>chords are 4 note chords in the eikosany, I many times add a fifth note to<br/>make a pentatonic.</p><p>&gt; Add extra tones to<br/>&gt; hexanies to create more scale-like melodic structures?</p><p>There aren&apos;t too many scales that contain hexanies. When using hexanies,  its<br/>properties of opposites prevail. If you start adding too many notes, the very<br/>structure can get lost. This might be good in some cases though, even<br/>desirable but haven&apos;t gotten there yet myself.</p><p>&gt;  What?

Dallesandro (see Wilson&apos;s Article) is probably the best filling<br/>of this space. It contains 2    1-3-7-9-11-15 eikosanies. one of which there<br/>was a vibraphone in. I found this 22 tone subset easier to work with due to<br/>less notes. When you are building instruments, size and space can become a<br/>problem. The 22 allowed me to move around much easier. The tetrads seem more<br/>melodically rich. If one is playing over a tetrad it is nice to have an<br/>interval in the semitone range. With the 1-3-5-7-9-11 eikosany, the 12/11 is<br/>the smallest interval. There are other things, like with the 15 Eikosany the<br/>tritone remains a dissonance at least structurally, if not acoustically. But<br/>yes, I followed your train of thought originally.</p><p>&gt;</p><p>&gt;<br/>&gt; If I&apos;m not mistaken, <a href="http://www.anaphoria.com/trans22.html">http://www.anaphoria.com/trans22.html</a> shows three more<br/>&gt; 22-CS just scales.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; .</p><p>&gt;</p><p>-- Kraig Grady<br/>North American Embassy of Anaphoria Island<br/><a href="http://www.anaphoria.com">http://www.anaphoria.com</a></p></div>
