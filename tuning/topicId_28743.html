And yes, I think<br/>these pieces are great!  Mostly because of their content, not my tuning<br/>(though I won&apos;t deny I love the tuning as well, but my opinion is by<br/>definition biased).  Of the three, my favorite is The Mishandled<br/>Blacksmith, which cleverly weaves the famous Handel theme with the Big<br/>Ben motif, along with some excursions of Jay&apos;s own invention.</p><p>But let&apos;s talk about the other nine cuts.  Wonderful!  They range from<br/>the rather bizarre to the delightfully satirical.  In the latter<br/>category, Slide Trombona, a send-up of My Sherona, never fails to evoke<br/>a belly laugh when I hear it (Jay won first place in a Dr. Demento<br/>contest with this song).  So, too, do I&apos;ll Never Dial Again, The<br/>Carcinoma, and Jay&apos;s own Tuning at the Clubfoot (which may be the only<br/>piece in 12-tET, due to the accordion accompaniment, but is still<br/>delightful).</p><p>On the bizarre side are several selections which remind me of the music<br/>in the movie Eraserhead.  Atonal yet very vivid.  Listening to them, I<br/>feel transported to some other world, a bit frightening but somehow<br/>when one is there, it&apos;s the perfect place to be.</p><p>Jay has hinted that he might be willing to MP3 some of these songs for<br/>uploading.  Let&apos;s all bug him to do so!</p><p>JdL</p></div><h3>Jay Williams &#x3C;jaywill@tscnet.com&#x3E;</h3><span>9/29/2001 4:58:07 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>At 05:35 PM 9/29/01 -0700, you wrote:<br/>&gt;Thanks for this review John, you&apos;ve definitely got me wanting to hear<br/>&gt;it--Jay is okay!<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;--Dan Stearns<br/>&gt;<br/>Soitnly, I&apos;ve no qualms as to who has mp3&apos;s of these things.
