Modulation requires no polyphony. Be it jumping from one chord to another or composing in a single melodic line, modulation comprises any of three possibilities:</p><p>1. You shift the tonic while preserving the inital mode,<br/>2. You change the inital mode while preserving the tonic,<br/>3. You both shift the tonic and change the initial mode.</p><p>Where chords require three or more tones of a mode in all cases, and chord changes do not even necessitate the temporal lenght of a measure.</p><p>Just play the &grave;Sorcerer&apos;s Apprentice&grave; by Paul Dukas and see what I mean:</p><p><a href="http://www.8notes.com/scores/7300.asp?ftype=midi">http://www.8notes.com/scores/7300.asp?ftype=midi</a></p><p>Who would be daft enough to claim that there is no modulation when you play solo?</p><p>As for the nonsense of an interval of a unison, what has timbral differences or distorted hormonics got to do with unison?</p><p>In a tuning list discerning as little intervals as the satanic comma, all this blabber about the unison as an interval truly leaves me flabbergasted.</p><p>Cordially,<br/>Ozan</p><p>  ----- Original Message -----<br/>  From: <a href="mailto:Afmmjr@aol.com">Afmmjr@aol.com</a><br/>  To: <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a><br/>  Sent: 01 Mart 2006 &Ccedil;ar&scedil;amba 4:18<br/>  Subject: [tuning] Subject: Re: unison as an interval/modulation</p><p>  Hi Ozan and all,</p><p>  Alas, terms change their meaning over time.
