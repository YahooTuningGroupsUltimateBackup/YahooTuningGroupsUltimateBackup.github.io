What were these chords again? And what<br/>exactly was their relation to Scriabin&apos;s &quot;Mystic Chord,&quot; the Chord of<br/>the Pleroma? (I have read Yasser, but it was a long time ago now, and<br/>it was also an inter library loan, so I can&apos;t easily access the info<br/>and I also seem to have unfortunately forgotten most of the<br/>particulars.)</p><p>thanks,<br/>Dan</p></div><h3>D.Stearns &#x3C;STEARNS@CAPECOD.NET&#x3E;</h3><span>6/18/2000 9:54:04 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>I wrote,</p><p>&gt; This is a (anonymously annotated) version of Charles Ives&apos; essay<br/>&quot;Some Quarter-tone Impressions.&quot;</p><p>Whoops.
