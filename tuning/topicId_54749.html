I&apos;m pretty sure this is<br/>because the approach used of coloring the background on quoted lines but<br/>leaving the text black creates less contrast than I am used to between<br/>quoted and non-quoted text.  In my email client the non-quoted text is the<br/>only thing in black and as it turns out this means it is a lot easier for it<br/>to pop out from the quoted text which is in various colors (blue, green,<br/>red, purple, all on the dark side but a lot less dark than black).</p><p>So I&apos;d like to suggest trying the approach of colorizing the text itself.</p><p>Also because of how badly yahoo (or whatever) is constantly messing up<br/>quoted lines (causing extra line wraps that cause quote levels to be lost),<br/>I think that adding a blank line between different quoting levels tends to<br/>work against rather than for overall readability, because those mess-ups are<br/>quite frequent.</p><p>Even better would be to write an algorithm that would recognize the common<br/>mess-up pattern and fix it.

For myself I set my browsers text size<br/>to 75% for better viewing and less scrolling.  It might be good to get<br/>people&apos;s input about what size works best for them.  I think yahoo&apos;s is a<br/>little smaller, but also too small (and certainly too narrow and not<br/>monospace as needed) yet with too much linespace so wasting a lot of screen<br/>unnecessarily.</p><p>Thanks.</p><p>-Kurt</p></div><h3><a id=54761 href="#54761">ðŸ”—</a>Robert Walker &#x3C;robertwalker@ntlworld.com&#x3E;</h3><span>7/22/2004 7:12:26 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Hi Kurt,</p><p>&gt; So I&apos;d like to suggest trying the approach of colorizing the text itself.</p><p>Okay fine I&apos;ve done that.</p><p>&gt; Also because of how badly yahoo (or whatever) is constantly messing up<br/>&gt; quoted lines (causing extra line wraps that cause quote levels to be lost),<br/>&gt; I think that adding a blank line between different quoting levels tends to<br/>&gt; work against rather than for overall readability, because those mess-ups are<br/>&gt; quite frequent.</p><p>&gt; Even better would be to write an algorithm that would recognize the common<br/>&gt; mess-up pattern and fix it.

To me<br/>the olive/brown on yellow is the least clear (perhaps least contrast between<br/>foreground and background) and might be used for all quoting levels above<br/>your maximum limit if you have such a limit.</p><p>The rest of my comments here are too technical and so I&apos;ll post them on<br/>metatuning.</p><p>&gt;&gt; Even better would be to write an algorithm that would recognize the common<br/>&gt;&gt; mess-up pattern and fix it. It always involves extra line wraps causing<br/>&gt;&gt; alternate lines to be very short and at a lower quoting level. I think this<br/>&gt;&gt; could be fixed in the middle of paragraphs but perhaps not at the end, with<br/>&gt;&gt; high reliability. It would be great to get rid of that nonsense if it can<br/>&gt;&gt; be done!<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Thanks for the suggestion. I&apos;ve removed the gaps and made an algorithm<br/>&gt; to deal with the word wrapping giltches.</p><p>Wow it&apos;s really amazing.  I haven&apos;t seen one of those ugly glitches<br/>anywhere.  Only thing is it looks like the last line in each colorized block<br/>often has one less quote than the lines before it.</p><p>&gt; I wouldn&apos;t want to try and actualy fix the wrapping because just occasionally<br/>&gt; someone might actually reply with a single word or two words in the middle of<br/>&gt; all the quoted text. But that will be much rarer than the other way round and<br/>&gt; will leave it to the reader to pick up on it.</p><p>Hmm.  Funny I didn&apos;t see any straggling words though.  Maybe I was on the<br/>wrong pages this time to see glitches.</p><p>&gt;&gt; The only other comment so far is that I think for some reason consecutive<br/>&gt;&gt; quotes without spaces between them look better, are less visually<br/>&gt;&gt; distracting and are more clearly quoting rather than something else. That<br/>&gt;&gt; is I like<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt; better than<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt;</p><p>&gt; Okay I&apos;ve done that too.</p><p>Yes, I think it does look better.</p><p>&gt; One thought - occasionally &gt; may be used for some other meaning<br/>&gt; at the start of the text (as a symbol). Don&apos;t know if<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt; is likely to be sued too. If it does then<br/>&gt; it will replace it by &gt;&gt; which mat not be a matter<br/>&gt; of concern - we can meet that if / when we encounter it.</p><p>I think you mean if &gt; is not the first character, i.e. it is preceeded by<br/>whitespace?  Otherwise I don&apos;t get it.  It is essentially ambiguous, but<br/>that ambiguity comes with the medium.</p><p>&gt; On the matter of the text size - I&apos;ve made it for next upload so that the<br/>&gt; entire archive will use a single style sheet. So at least with the downloaded<br/>&gt; archive you will be able to chagne the text sizes by editing that style sheet.</p><p>No kidding?  I didn&apos;t know style sheets could be edited by the end user (the<br/>one doing the browsing).  How?

Regarding the progression of<br/>colors, I probably prefer a fixed &quot;wall&quot; limit to rotating through a fixed<br/>list of color pairs, for hopefully obvious reasons.  On the other hand it is<br/>a moot point if the limit is high enough.</p><p>So I think I minor tweak will do it, regarding the colors of quoting level 1<br/>as I said in tuning.  But if you want to have an actual method/algorithm<br/>behind the color generation here is one algorithm that comes to mind<br/>(untested mind you):</p><p>* Increasing quoting levels would have decreasing contrast between text and<br/>background.</p><p>* However even level 1 should have a much lighter text than level 0.</p><p>* Perhaps level 1 should be distinct in some other way since it is the text<br/>being replied to.  This &quot;other way&quot; should not be too dramatic, but perhaps<br/>just by level 0 being highest contras, level 1 being next highest but with a<br/>gap after that that distinguishes other levels more significantly.  Or it<br/>just might fall out of the progression...</p><p>* With increasing level, text then might continue to get lighter while<br/>backgrund gets darker but with an asymptote to prevent fading out and to<br/>prevent the background becomong so dark that it is distracting.  The<br/>background on level 6 is perhaps a little dark and does distract.</p><p>* Then within that structure if the hue were to rotate by a constant angle<br/>that does not divide into 360 then you have an algorithm for a pattern that<br/>doesn&apos;t repeat at any level.  I actually used such an algorithm for hue<br/>succesfully in a charting program to generate the colors for successive<br/>bars.  IIRC I used approximatly 1 radian as the hue delta, but I&apos;m really<br/>not sure, but when you hit a good delta you will know it is right.  It looks<br/>like you have a good eye for color.</p><p>These are just untested thoughts and I&apos;m not attached to them.  You may have<br/>actually done something a little like this either by algorithm or manually,<br/>but the looks of it.</p><p>Thanks for all your work and your fantasticly active receptivity to<br/>feedback!</p><p>-Kurt</p></div><h3><a id=54806 href="#54806">ðŸ”—</a>Kurt Bigler &#x3C;kkb@breathsense.com&#x3E;</h3><span>7/23/2004 4:41:39 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>on 7/23/04 4:07 PM, Kurt Bigler &lt;<a href="mailto:kkb@breathsense.com">kkb@breathsense.com</a>&gt; wrote:</p><p>&gt; on tuning, on 7/22/04 7:12 AM, Robert Walker wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt; Hi Kurt,<br/>&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt; So I&apos;d like to suggest trying the approach of colorizing the text itself.<br/>&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt; Okay fine I&apos;ve done that.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; So regarding the color scheme, here are the more technical comments that I<br/>&gt; wanted to keep off the main tuning list.</p><p>OOPS.

But one step at a time, so the value of the<br/>&gt; idea can be determined from experience.)</p><p>Well it would be someone else programming that, not my<br/>area at all to write a tuning list script, or hack<br/>an existing cgi script to do this.</p><p>But if we had such a dictionary available, then<br/>perhaps it could be used in just this way<br/>at some later date by someone with the necessary<br/>skills in Perl or PhP or whatever.</p><p>Robert</p></div><h3><a id=54810 href="#54810">ðŸ”—</a>Carl Lumma &#x3C;ekin@lumma.org&#x3E;</h3><span>7/23/2004 5:11:14 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>&gt; So regarding the color scheme, here are the more technical<br/>&gt; comments that I wanted to keep off the main tuning list.</p><p>Sorry to see your hopes dashed.  :)</p><p>&gt; Again here is a good url for seeing the colors of 7 levels<br/>&gt; of quoting:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<a href="http://www.robertinventor.com/tuning-math/s__12/">http://www.robertinventor.com/tuning-math/s__12/</a><br/>&gt;msg_11000-11024.html#11005</p><p>Beautiful, Robert!!  Three cheers!</p><p>&gt;Continuing where I left off on tuning...  Regarding the<br/>&gt;progression of colors, I probably prefer a fixed &quot;wall&quot;<br/>&gt;limit to rotating through a fixed list of color pairs,<br/>&gt;for hopefully obvious reasons.</p><p>Yes, that does sound like a good idea.</p><p>&gt;* Increasing quoting levels would have decreasing contrast<br/>&gt;between text and background.</p><p>I thought about this but it probably wouldn&apos;t work very well<br/>in practice.  Probably just 5 highly-contrasting colors is<br/>best, with the wall at 5 levels.  Or perhaps the gradient<br/>could be applied to the wall only.  For example the 5th color<br/>is fairly light, and gets darker with every subsquent level,<br/>while levels 1-4 are highly contrasted.</p><p>-Carl</p></div><h3><a id=54812 href="#54812">ðŸ”—</a>Robert Walker &#x3C;robertwalker@ntlworld.com&#x3E;</h3><span>7/23/2004 6:17:34 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Hi Kurt,</p><p>&gt; <a href="http://www.robertinventor.com/tuning-math/s__12/msg_11000-11024.html#11005">http://www.robertinventor.com/tuning-math/s__12/msg_11000-11024.html#11005</a></p><p>&gt; Maybe you have an even better one handy.</p><p>Thanks,that&apos;s useful. No I don&apos;t have a better one handy<br/>as I just made one up in order to figure out the<br/>colours in sequence.</p><p>&gt; Wow it&apos;s really amazing. I haven&apos;t seen one of those ugly glitches<br/>&gt; anywhere. Only thing is it looks like the last line in each colorized block<br/>&gt; often has one less quote than the lines before it.</p><p>Yes that is intentional. It&apos;s because often the quote level<br/>varies by a number of indentations with blank lines<br/>To avoid stripes consisting of just blank lines<br/>it keeps to the same colour until it meets a<br/>reason to change it. A blank line never counts<br/>as a reason for changing colour, whether indented<br/>or not.</p><p>The algorithm as it is now just writes out each line<br/>as it comes to it without look back. To fix it<br/>I would need to redo it so that it can do a look<br/>back. Not hard at all - maybe could do it sone time.</p><p>&gt; &gt; I wouldn&apos;t want to try and actualy fix the wrapping because just occasionally<br/>&gt; &gt; someone might actually reply with a single word or two words in the middle of<br/>&gt; &gt; all the quoted text. But that will be much rarer than the other way round and<br/>&gt; &gt; will leave it to the reader to pick up on it.</p><p>&gt; Hmm. Funny I didn&apos;t see any straggling words though. Maybe I was on the<br/>&gt; wrong pages this time to see glitches.</p><p>Yes there are a few. Case where the response is<br/>a short sentence of a few words. You may not<br/>even notice them easily as they blend in<br/>with the flow of the rest of the post.</p><p>However I found a method that could help with that<br/>- with next upload it will colour a line differently<br/>even if just two words if it starts with a<br/>capitalissed word and ends with punctuation.<br/>Hopefully that will deal with a few of those.</p><p>&gt; &gt; On the matter of the text size - I&apos;ve made it for next upload so that the<br/>&gt; &gt; entire archive will use a single style sheet. So at least with the downloaded<br/>&gt; &gt; archive you will be able to chagne the text sizes by editing that style sheet.</p><p>&gt; No kidding? I didn&apos;t know style sheets could be edited by the end user (the<br/>&gt; one doing the browsing). How? Maybe this is only supported by specific<br/>browsers, maybe only on Windows?</p><p>Sorry, I meant that after you download the archive,<br/>and unzip it onto your local machine, you can edit<br/>your local style sheet. I don&apos;t know if you can let the<br/>user edit the style sheet on-line as well - would need some<br/>way for it to persist from one page to another.</p><p>One thing you can certainly do is to have<br/>a selection of different style sheets<br/>and let the user choose which one they<br/>want for the entire site.</p><p>See this demo:<br/><a href="http://tech.irt.org/articles/js065/custom.htm">http://tech.irt.org/articles/js065/custom.htm</a></p><p>I don&apos;t know if you can also<br/>let them chose individual<br/>colours and store those in<br/>a cookie - maybe somehow by<br/>using javascript I sort of feel<br/>maybe you might be able to.<br/>Or you could do it<br/>if serving up the style sheet<br/>to the user - using cookies perhaps.</p><p>Thanks for the suggestions about colour.<br/>Yes I see what you mean about level<br/>1 not standing out particularly<br/>when you have multiple levels<br/>of replies. Maybe just changing<br/>the colour there from olive to<br/>something else more distinctive for the<br/>first layer would do the trick,<br/>some more intense colour as the<br/>background is already one of the<br/>lightest, just that the text is also<br/>light. I suppose I wanted it to<br/>contrast well with the current text by<br/>being a lot lighter but it<br/>doesn&apos;t work so well once you<br/>see it with the other layers.</p><p>I can&apos;t reslly see it with a fresh<br/>eye right now. I&apos;ll try again<br/>next week before the next upload<br/>and see if I can do something better<br/>for the first quoting level.</p><p>Yes I did try something a bit like<br/>your idea - my thought was to vary<br/>the colour between successive levels<br/>of quoting, and I applied it rather<br/>the other way around - to get gradually<br/>more intense in colour as they went back.</p><p>Then just chose them individually by eye<br/>and didn&apos;t keep to it rigidly. That<br/>lets you choose pairs of colours<br/>that go nicely together.</p><p>The other thought I had in mind<br/>is that many users are colour blind.<br/>So I try to make sure that colours<br/>are ones that colour blind users<br/>will be able to distinguish. So \I<br/>tried to vary the blue / red component<br/>with each level of quoting<br/>as everyone can distinguish blue<br/>from red if they have any colour<br/>discrimination at all - and also<br/>to vary the intensity of blue<br/>and red which again everyone<br/>should be able to distinguish<br/>if they can distinguish colours.<br/>For the few that can see but can&apos;t<br/>distinguish colour, I try to vary<br/>the overall brightness, but that is<br/>less effective here as there are so<br/>many distinctions to do.</p><p>Robert</p></div><h3><a id=54814 href="#54814">ðŸ”—</a>Robert Walker &#x3C;robertwalker@ntlworld.com&#x3E;</h3><span>7/23/2004 6:48:40 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Hi Kurt,</p><p>&gt; &gt; Now to link to an individual message within the archive, just navigate to that<br/>&gt; &gt; message and use the Contents link after the message number.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; This will put a url into the browser address bar which you can then use to<br/>&gt; &gt; link to that individual message .<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; Or if you want to link to the message without the contents listing, click the<br/>&gt; This works fine, but seems like you are taking advantage of a side-effect to<br/>&gt; get a feature, which people can get used to but is indirect. It may not<br/>&gt; seem worth adding another link for directness, but perhaps just clicking on<br/>&gt; the message number itself is an intuitive way to get a url for that message<br/>&gt; number. Just a thought.</p><p>Yes I could do. The thing is - if it is done that way usually user would<br/>want the page to stay as it is. So maybe you need a bit of javascript<br/>to check first to see whether the message is showing within a frame<br/>or not. So - if inside a contents list, it jsut shows the contents<br/>list url, and otherwise shows the page url.</p><p>So the number would have another meaning too, and not quite<br/>duplicating<br/>&lt;number&gt; - shows url and doesn&apos;t change anything.<br/>&lt;contents&gt; - shows it and chagnes to contents if needed.<br/>&lt;hide contents&gt; - shows it and hides contents if needed.</p><p>&gt; &gt; Techy note:<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; The solution was to replace the # in the link by an &amp;. It seems that you can&apos;t<br/>&gt; &gt; have a # after a ? in the url for some reason. Then my script for writing out<br/>&gt; the frame dynamically just changes the &amp; back into a # again.</p><p>&gt; I don&apos;t get this. At a single level of url, the # comes after the ?, i.e.<br/>&gt; the fragment comes after the query string. If you want your query string to<br/>&gt; contain an embedded url (or partial url) then you do need to escape the<br/>&gt; characters that the top-level url parser recognizes or else map it in some<br/>&gt; way. My reference says url parsing works like this (with extra spaces for<br/>&gt; readability):</p><p>&gt; scheme :// host : port / path ? query # fragment</p><p>Oh right. That is sort of what I&apos;d expect too - but it just didn&apos;t work.<br/>Maybe I was doing something else wrong?</p><p>If I try it like that, then the page doesn&apos;t load at all.<br/>Nothing happens.</p><p>I tried putting in an alert to alert<br/>me of the input string when the page loaded<br/>and it didn&apos;t show up - the page doesn&apos;t even load<br/>as far as I can tell (though hard to say as<br/>there is nothing in it before it writes out<br/>what it should write out).</p><p>As soon as I remove the # from the url string then it pops up the message<br/>with the input string after the ? so somehow the<br/># is preventing my page from loading, but don&apos;t<br/>know why.</p><p>I only tried it out with IE - which I try first<br/>because if a script doesn&apos;t work in IE thn<br/>really there is no point at all in considering<br/>it as most visitors use that browser and<br/>aren&apos;t likely to swap browser to view the<br/>page.</p><p>You can experiment if you like with a demo<br/>page and see if you can get it to work<br/>- easy enough to do.</p><p>&gt; &gt; Fixed :-).</p><p>&gt; So the above is sort of moot but I&apos;ll leave it FWIW.</p><p>Yes as it works with this substitituion<br/>trick, and with all the browsers, no<br/>great concern - however of<br/>technical interest so I too<br/>would be interested to know why if anyone finds out.</p><p>Robert</p></div><h3><a id=54815 href="#54815">ðŸ”—</a>Kurt Bigler &#x3C;kkb@breathsense.com&#x3E;</h3><span>7/23/2004 7:42:00 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>on 7/23/04 5:05 PM, Robert Walker &lt;<a href="mailto:robertwalker@ntlworld.com">robertwalker@ntlworld.com</a>&gt; wrote:</p><p>&gt; Hi Kurt,<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt; ....space....Jumpin&apos; Dave writes: I uploaded this group.

A<br/>&gt; blank line never counts as a reason for changing colour, whether indented or<br/>&gt; not.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; The algorithm as it is now just writes out each line as it comes to it without<br/>&gt; look back.

I can parse the contents file myself<br/>&gt; and extract them - but if you want to do that for me then it will save a<br/>&gt; little work.

I will just ignore multiple white space and<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; characters between words when doing the comparisions - that&apos;s very easy to do.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I&apos;ve just found a way of doing the dictionary definitions<br/>&gt; as a &quot;tooltip&quot;s using the overlib tool tip library:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; <a href="http://www.bosrup.com/web/overlib/">http://www.bosrup.com/web/overlib/</a><br/>&gt; which works with all the main browsers they say.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Here it is with tool tips:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; <a href="http://www.robertinventor.com/test_overlib_tool_tips/index.htm">http://www.robertinventor.com/test_overlib_tool_tips/index.htm</a><br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; So the obvious thing really is to make a complete<br/>&gt; dictionary from Joe Monzo&apos;s contents list - but<br/>&gt; leave all the undefined entries blank.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; So the undefined ones will just pop up a tip<br/>&gt; saying &quot;Look up in Tonalsoft Encyclopedia&quot;<br/>&gt; and that&apos;s all they say.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Then we can add short definitions above<br/>&gt; that for more and more entries as time<br/>&gt; goes on. So that gives both at once :-).<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; If the dictionary idea isn&apos;t felt to be helpful<br/>&gt; after I have done an experimental upload using<br/>&gt; a few to show what it would be like,<br/>&gt; then it will be an easy matter to leave out the definitions<br/>&gt; altogether, and have tool tips that pop up and lead<br/>&gt; to the encyclopedia and leave it at that.</p><p>This all sounds good.</p><p>I&apos;m not sure I like tool tips though.  These work better than some, but<br/>having the separate frame you used before has the advantage of allowing you<br/>to mouse over things without obscuring other things you may also be looking<br/>at.  If there is a &quot;cookie&quot; way to make it an option to use tool tip versus<br/>separate frame that&apos;d be good, I think.  The separate frame was so<br/>uninvasive.

The ratio between these two<br/>&gt; pitches (i.e. 81/80) is a unison vector.

It is a typical mathematical type definition.<br/>But it does put some demands on the reader, they need<br/>to puzzle things out. That&apos;s not necessarily a bad<br/>thing at all, but it may be interesting to explain<br/>as this often isn&apos;t at all obvious to the author.</p><p>So, for instance, it assumes that the user knows that the lsttice<br/>is a lattice of pitches, and that they understand that a periodicity<br/>block is a scale, and that by the 3 axis you mean the axis<br/>along which the pitch increments by multiples of 3, and<br/>that they are reasonably comfortable with the idea<br/>of an interval as a vector, and that they can see that<br/>81/64 is the same as 3^4/64.</p><p>Try reading it again and try to forget that you know<br/>that a lattice is a lattice of pitches, and<br/>that the 3 axis means the direction along which pitch<br/>increments by intervals of 3/2, and try to forget<br/>your ability to see readily that 81 is the same<br/>as 3^4 (through familiarity) see if you can<br/>figure it out...</p><p>By the end of your definition it is quite possible<br/>that a newbie reader may have no idea yet<br/>for instance that a 5-limit just intonation twelve<br/>tone scale is a periodicity block. They may<br/>think they understand it, but if questioned<br/>they might not yet have got that point.</p><p>So it depends who it is targetted towards. My definition<br/>was meant for a complete newbie who isn&apos;t very<br/>familiar with the idea of a lattice of pitches<br/>at all. So I take the view that they need<br/>as many hints as one can and if one can<br/>hint at things several times so much<br/>the better. That is why it seems back to front -<br/>because I start with the things most familiar<br/>to a newbie rather than the things most fundamental<br/>to the definition.</p><p>So you write it out, look at it,<br/>think whether there are any hints you can<br/>add, and whether it can be made to say<br/>the same thing with less technical language,<br/>write it out again, look at it again,<br/>change the order,...</p><p>It can take a long time to reduce<br/>a technical definition to a non technical<br/>one. I think of the two the non technical<br/>one is possibly slightly the harder to do.</p><p>But readers don&apos;t need to stop and puzzle things<br/>out with the less techy style, and there is something<br/>to be said for requiring them to do so<br/>as things you puzzle out may be remembered<br/>more readily because you put more work into<br/>understanding it.</p><p>Also I find mathematicians rarely give<br/>concrete examples of the thing they are<br/>defining, tending to leave it up to<br/>the reader to make one up to test<br/>the definition. That again is fine<br/>if you are doing the puzzle type<br/>definition, because the reader will<br/>learn a lot from making up their own example<br/>to fit the definition, but giving one<br/>well chosen concrete example<br/>is helpful if your aim is rather<br/>to minimize puzzlement.</p><p>In short, your definition is probably<br/>a suitable one for typical<br/>denizons of the tuning-math<br/>list or mathematician visitors<br/>- while mine is perhaps<br/>more suitable for a visitor<br/>from the main tuning list<br/>who wants to try and figure<br/>out what they are all talking<br/>about over there :-).</p><p>Maybe we need two versions<br/>of the dictionary, perhaps again<br/>set using a cookie, or three<br/>even - one with Gene&apos;s style<br/>ultra short definition:</p><p>A comma used to define the bounds of a periodicity block.</p><p>which does have a kind of minimalist poetry<br/>to it doesn&apos;t it :-).</p><p>I&apos;m not sure what this means in terms<br/>of organising and collaborating,<br/>but maybe we need three dictionaries.</p><p>Or, have a mix of entries in<br/>different styles depending on the<br/>contributor perhaps.</p><p>Another idea is to have a multiple<br/>definition dictionary source<br/>and have some way for the web<br/>master (rather than the visitor)<br/>to choose which one they want to<br/>set as the preset one, perhaps with<br/>some way for the visitor to choose between them<br/>using cookies.</p><p>Robert</p></div><h3><a id=54950 href="#54950">ðŸ”—</a>Robert Walker &#x3C;robertwalker@ntlworld.com&#x3E;</h3><span>7/26/2004 4:46:24 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Hi Joseph,</p><p>&gt; ***Most probably I&apos;m just misunderstanding this... but Pitch Class<br/>&gt; sets (PC) *imply* octave equivalence...

These work better than some, but<br/>&gt; having the separate frame you used before has the advantage of allowing you<br/>&gt; to mouse over things without obscuring other things you may also be looking<br/>&gt; at. If there is a &quot;cookie&quot; way to make it an option to use tool tip versus<br/>&gt; separate frame that&apos;d be good, I think. The separate frame was so<br/>&gt; uninvasive. Except of course it takes screen space! So I can see why it is<br/>&gt; useful. Options are great, for everybody except the person implementing all<br/>&gt; the options!</p><p>Yes, I can see that. Can perhaps do that if I can find a way to get it to work<br/>with opera - or anyway and just have a warning that it doesn&apos;t<br/>work for opera.</p><p>Meanwhile though, and less work :-), the overlib library has an option to offset the<br/>tool tip by any desired amount horizontally or vertically, so<br/>perhaps that will do the trick:</p><p><a href="http://www.robertinventor.com/test_overlib_tool_tips/index.htm">http://www.robertinventor.com/test_overlib_tool_tips/index.htm</a></p><p>You might sometimes need to scroll down the page to see the complete<br/>tool tip - but as it is sticky you can do so after it shows up.</p><p>Robert</p></div><h3><a id=54959 href="#54959">ðŸ”—</a>Carl Lumma &#x3C;ekin@lumma.org&#x3E;</h3><span>7/26/2004 8:36:01 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>&gt;the overlib library has an option to<br/>&gt;offset the tool tip by any desired<br/>&gt;amount horizontally or vertically, so<br/>&gt;perhaps that will do the trick:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<a href="http://www.robertinventor.com/test_overlib_tool_tips/index.htm">http://www.robertinventor.com/test_overlib_tool_tips/index.htm</a></p><p>Great stuff, Robert!</p><p>-Carl</p></div><h3><a id=54969 href="#54969">ðŸ”—</a>monz &#x3C;monz@attglobal.net&#x3E;</h3><span>7/26/2004 10:27:19 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, Carl Lumma &lt;ekin@l...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt; &gt;the overlib library has an option to<br/>&gt; &gt;offset the tool tip by any desired<br/>&gt; &gt;amount horizontally or vertically, so<br/>&gt; &gt;perhaps that will do the trick:<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;<a href="http://www.robertinventor.com/test_overlib_tool_tips/index.htm">http://www.robertinventor.com/test_overlib_tool_tips/index.htm</a><br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Great stuff, Robert!<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; -Carl</p><p>yes, i agree!  i like the tool-tip method of showing<br/>the short definitions.</p><p>-monz</p></div><h3><a id=55001 href="#55001">ðŸ”—</a>Joseph Pehrson &#x3C;jpehrson@rcn.com&#x3E;</h3><span>7/26/2004 8:15:34 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, Carl Lumma &lt;ekin@l...&gt; wrote:</p><p><a href="/tuning/topicId_54749.html#54959">/tuning/topicId_54749.html#54959</a></p><p>&gt; &gt;the overlib library has an option to<br/>&gt; &gt;offset the tool tip by any desired<br/>&gt; &gt;amount horizontally or vertically, so<br/>&gt; &gt;perhaps that will do the trick:<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;<a href="http://www.robertinventor.com/test_overlib_tool_tips/index.htm">http://www.robertinventor.com/test_overlib_tool_tips/index.htm</a><br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Great stuff, Robert!<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; -Carl</p><p>***Robert&apos;s &quot;mouseovers&quot; are really great here...</p><p>JP</p></div>
