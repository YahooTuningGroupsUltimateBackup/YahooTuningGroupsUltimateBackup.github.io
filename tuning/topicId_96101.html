Chrysanthos of Madytos, for example, gives an example<br/>of the Fourth Mode in its papadic or diatonic form which resembles a<br/>conjunct Maqam Rast -- e.g. 200-166-133-200-166-133-200 cents if the<br/>tuning is expressed in terms of the Committee of 1881 (based on 36-ed2).<br/>This form, uninflected, as in an example by Chrysanthos, would have a<br/>9:8 or regular tone leading up to the final, e.g. F-G in one possible<br/>transcription. However, as I recall Chrysanthos himself documents, some<br/>performers back then -- and many now -- prefer a &quot;law of attraction&quot;<br/>where F in F-G would be raised to F+ or F-half-sharp, as it would be<br/>written in Arab notation -- in Byzantine terms, a &quot;minimal tone&quot; below<br/>G, or around 133 cents under the Committee of 1881&apos;s recommendations.</p><p>This kind of alteration is also documented in the era of Chrysanthos<br/>by Mikhail Mashaqa, a Syrian theorist, in Arab music under some<br/>circumstances.</p><p>And it can be observed in Arab and Turkish performances of Maqam<br/>Rast, for example, where an ascending form like C D Ed F G A Bd C<br/>has a Zalzalian or middle third and seventh (e.g. at 27/22 and 81/44,<br/>or 355 and 1057 cents if al-Farabi&apos;s tuning is followed), but with<br/>a minor seventh in descent, C D Ed F G A Bb C (with Bb around 16/9,<br/>or closer to 7/4 in some Turkish practice).</p><p>The Arabic terms dint and dunt refer to raising or lowering a note<br/>(often in modern practice by a semitone) to emphasize an important<br/>note such as the ghammaz (confinal or dominant where two genera<br/>are joined), for example, and seem parallel to Byzantine &quot;attraction.&quot;</p><p>Similar patterns happen in medieval and Renaissance European music,<br/>often described by theorists in terms of polyphonic practices<br/>(e.g. a preference for a vertical or harmonic major third before<br/>a resolution to a fifth, or major sixth before an octave), but also<br/>reported in plainsong, which is more parallel in its mainly melodic<br/>focus to maqam music or the Byzantine tradition.</p><p>For example, writers near the end of the 15th century in Europe<br/>report the use of semitones which are _subintellectum_ or<br/>&quot;understood&quot; by performers of Gregorian chant, e.g. a passage<br/>with the figure A A G A which is sung A A G# A.</p><p>Of course, the element of the ison or moveable pedal point in<br/>Byzantine music does add a certain polyphonic aspect, and I<br/>have seen some modern Byzantine settings that resemble the<br/>two-voice polyphony of Guido d&apos;Arezzo in the 11th century,<br/>for example, with an emphasis on the consonance of the fourth<br/>(which also defines a melodic tetrachord, and so can underscore<br/>the patterns of a chant), and sustained notes which resemble<br/>the Byzantine ison.</p><p>Both in whether to use an inflection in a given passage, and<br/>how to tune that inflection, various local and personal customs<br/>may vary: Byzantine intonation is a topic for lively dialogue<br/>and debate, on the Web today as well as elsewhere. But the<br/>&quot;attractions&quot; are themselves a point of consensus, even if<br/>people differ on when, where, and how.</p><p>With many thanks,</p><p>Margo Schulter<br/>mschulter@...</p></div><h3>baros_ilogic@...</h3><span>3/23/2014 1:11:23 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Thank you Margo! It seems like Byzantine intonations lack an extended and in-depth classification, because there has been no study of them, like those by Alain Dani&eacute;lou or Erv Wilson on Hindu music for example. But given the oral tradition of it, I wonder how accurate are the 22 ratios we generally consider to define Indian music.</p><p>This is also true for Arabic, Turkish, Persian &amp; so on musical cultures. Although there have been numerous classifications, my knowledge is limited in this area. Eric Ederer has a doctoral dissertation on the subject, I&apos;ll ask him for a copy. What do you think about this resource? Does anyone know about other classifications that won&apos;t require going through mountains of historical heritage?</p><p>Many thanks,<br/>Bogdan</p></div><h3>Margo Schulter &#x3C;mschulter@...&#x3E;</h3><span>3/23/2014 10:16:41 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Dear Bogdan,</p><p>Please let me indeed recommend Eric Ederer&apos;s dissertation as an excellent<br/>source on lots of aspects of the Turkish maqamat. What I&apos;d say is that<br/>tunings can be highly variable in Turkish, Byzantine, Arab, or Persian<br/>music -- and likely in Kurdish music also, I suspect.</p><p>There&apos;s actually a lot out there, both in terms of measured modern<br/>tunings and performances (sometimes involving flexible-pitch performances<br/>as well as fixed frettings and the like), and in terms of traditional<br/>tuning theory going back to al-Farabi in the 10th century, who reports<br/>the practice of Mansur Zalzal, an &grave;oudist in 8th-century Baghdad.</p><p>What I&apos;d emphasize is that lots of modal concepts, as in Ederer&apos;s dissertation, can usefully be applied to a range of tunings, with<br/>relative adjustments of notes or intervals often being more important<br/>than the precise absolute values, which might vary with performers or<br/>from region to region.</p><p>For example, in conventional 20th-century Turkish theory, and indeed<br/>for many practical musicians including Eric Ederer himself on his<br/>nautilauta (a custom-designed fretted JI instrument), a rast tetrachord<br/>would be 1/1-9/8-5/4-4/3. There&apos;s an understanding that in descending<br/>to a final cadence -- one manifestation of _cazibe_ or &quot;gravity,&quot;<br/>synonymous with the Byzantine &quot;attraction&quot; principle -- the third is<br/>lowered a bit, maybe to 26/21 or 16/13, for example.</p><p>As it happens, I often play an &quot;Ottoman Rast&quot; at 1/1-9/8-26/21-4/3,<br/>a lower interpretation. So, in order to follow the ideal of cazibe<br/>or attraction, I lower the third step to 16/13, or maybe 11/9 -- the<br/>same kind of relative shift, although both the usual and lowered forms<br/>are a bit narrower thirds than 5/4 and 26/21, say.</p><p>For some measurements of modern frettings and performances, Jean During<br/>and Amine Beyhom are good sources, and also a study on recordings of<br/>Turkish music done by Boris Bozkurt, Can Akkoc, Ozan Yarman, and others.<br/>Some of these are available on the web. And the historical tunings of<br/>al-Farabi, Ibn Sina, Safi al-Din al-Urmawi, and Qutb al-Din al-Shirazi<br/>are quite beautiful, showing the diversity of 10th-14th century practice.</p><p>With Byzantine tuning practice, you&apos;ll find some differing approaches<br/>and sometimes heated controversies on the web and elsewhere. It helps<br/>to know that the Byzantine Diatonic is actually a Zalzalian diatonic,<br/>with a tetrachord formed from a tone at around 9:8 (or sometimes a bit<br/>larger), and two middle steps sometimes called the &quot;minor tone&quot; and<br/>&quot;minimal tone,&quot; at 12:11 and 88:81 (151 and 143 cents) in the tuning<br/>of Chrysanthos of Madytos in the early 19th century which follows<br/>that of al-Farabi about 900 years earlier -- or 167 and 133 cents<br/>according to the Committee on Music of 1881. In practice, there will<br/>be various shadings.</p><p>Byzantine practice has been expressed theoretically in 36-ed2 (as in<br/>1881), 68-ed2 (as in Chrysanthos and followers as one model), or in<br/>some 20th-century accounts in 72-ed2 (at times bringing into play<br/>intervals not present in 36-ed2, as with approximations of ratios<br/>of 5).</p><p>An important thing for people like Eric and me who like JI tunings<br/>to acknowledge is that lots of tunings are variable -- Iranian<br/>musicians are not necessarily going for precise ratios, for fifths<br/>and fourths or other types of intervals, but for a pleasing variety,<br/>for example in 17-note frettings on the tar or setar. Ratios like<br/>12:11 and 13:12 are elegant and often influential, but not definitive<br/>of how people fret or play in practice, although some measured tunings<br/>come quite close.</p><p>As some of the Turkish studies have shown, often flexible-pitch<br/>performers are aiming not so much for a single pitch in order to<br/>represent a given step like &quot;the third step of Rast,&quot; but a &quot;cluster&quot;<br/>or region which could cover 20 cents or more. Some performers actually<br/>speak of &quot;glissando zones&quot; between a regular minor third and a regular<br/>major third (at 32/27 and 81/64, say), thus underscoring this<br/>flexibility.</p><p>Again, During (carrying further some of the researches of Nelly Caron<br/>and Dariush Safvate in the mid-20th-century), Beyhom, and the recent<br/>Turkish studies are one good source -- with various discussions of<br/>Byzantine intonation another.</p><p>Above all, thank you for asking an important question, and giving<br/>me an opportunity to comment both on some beautiful traditional<br/>tunings and on the considerable scope for flexibility,</p><p>In peace and love,</p><p>Margo</p></div><h3>baros_ilogic@...</h3><span>3/25/2014 4:05:52 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Dear Margo,</p><p>Thank you for the reading list, and most of all for the sunshine you bring along every time you share knowledge.</p><p>It is the relative adjustments that interest me - not so much the exact ratios used by different performers in different regions, but the complete range of movement. To use your example, this would be &quot;between 11/9 and 5/4: not higher than 5/4 in ascent, not lower than 11/9 in descent; ratios included: 16/13 (descent) &amp; 26/21 (ascent/descent)&quot;. This range, when extended to around a doubling in acoustic space - mostly in the lower part, covers the large &quot;glissando zone&quot; between 32/27 and 81/64.</p><p>I have this crazy theory about the &quot;gravity&quot; or &quot;attraction&quot; principle, according to which the ascent follows overtone tonal patterns, while the descent is naturally attracted to &quot;step on&quot; undertones. To use the same example, 1/1 9/8 5/4 4/3 refers to harmonics 24 27 30 32 from the ascending harmonic series. When descending, the 4/3 becomes 1/1 and the closest approximation to 26/21 would be harmonic 29 in the range (feel free to read from right to left) 36 32 29 27 of the descending harmonic series. If we wish to stay inside the same (mirrored) numbers 24-32 32-24, then the ascending 9/8 won&apos;t have a counterpart and it too will have to move. The problem is - and that&apos;s why all this is still a speculative adventure - this tone will be attracted to a higher place at subharmonic 28, thus (right to left again): 32 28 26 24. In this version 16/13 corresponds precisely with subharmonic 26, and the 9/8 becomes 8/7, when 1/1 is taken as the first tone on the left. That would explain why sometimes the 9/8 is a bit larger; also there is no reason for staying inside this double, because the same numbers can be reduced to 16 14 13 12. Incidentally, this corresponds with the right half (&quot;tetrachord&quot;) of Kathleen Schlesinger&apos;s Phrygian or Venus Mode.</p><p>In harmony,<br/>Bogdan</p></div><h3>Margo Schulter &#x3C;mschulter@...&#x3E;</h3><span>3/28/2014 1:28:20 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Dear Bogdan,</p><p>This is a very quick reply for the moment, with my apologies for not<br/>visiting and checking the group more often! Thank you for your<br/>patience.</p><p>Your hypothesis is fascinating, and of course might most apply to<br/>flexible pitch performances. But whatever may hold there, you<br/>have cited two tunings or ratios that I think merit special<br/>attention.</p><p>The first is 16:14:13:12, Ibn Sina&apos;s &quot;most noble genus&quot; which for<br/>me is a kind of &quot;septimal Rast&quot; that I consider a related maqam<br/>in its own right, but also sometimes an inflected variation on<br/>Rast. And, of course, it does fit with the harmoniai of Kathleen<br/>Schlesinger and Elsie Hamilton.</p><p>Boris Bozkurt, Ozan Yarman, Can Akkoc, and colleagues<br/>have described one kind of cazibe or attraction that can bring<br/>this tuning about in Arab music: the Sikah (from Persian or Turkish<br/>Segah) family maqamat. Here we might have a usual Rast tetrachord of something like 1/1-9/8-16/13-4/3, with an emphasis on the third<br/>step, named sikah (from Persian segah, &quot;third&quot; step or location).<br/>To get a smaller leading-tone below this step, the 9/8 step tends<br/>to be raised by around a comma, to 8/7 -- giving us a compact<br/>8/7-16/13 or 14:13 step, which I find delightful.</p><p>On keyboard, I might play the usual 16/13 Rast D*-E*-F#-G* (showing<br/>the upper chain of fifths with an * sign), and this nuance as<br/>D*-F-F#-G* (1/1-8/7-16/13-4/3).</p><p>Here the third step itself, or actually the final or resting note<br/>of Sikah, doesn&apos;t necessarily change in an Arab context, but the<br/>leading tone gets raised for a more definitive cadence. It&apos;s a<br/>neat use for a comma nuance -- and for two keys a comma apart<br/>in a keyboard tuning.</p><p>But your example raises a question. In the Turkish setting we<br/>were addressing, how about ascending<br/>1/1-9/8-26/21-4/3-3/2-27/16-13/7-2/1<br/>or D*-E*-Gb*-G*-A*-B*-Db*-D*, but then descending<br/>1/1-8/7-16/13-4/3-3/2-27/16-39/22-2/1<br/>or D*-F-Gb*-G*-A*-B*-C*-D?</p><p>That would be a combination of segah or the third step<br/>falling a bit from 26/21 to 16/13, and dugah or the<br/>step at the tone rising a bit to meet it, so to speak.<br/>As a result, the middle step of the tetrachord gets<br/>compressed from 208:189 or 165.8 cents to 14:13 or<br/>128.3 cents -- a difference of 1352/1323 or 37.5 cents!</p><p>This is interesting, because 208:189 and 14:13 both<br/>occur in Ibn Sina, and represent what we might call<br/>his largest and smallest Zalzalian steps.</p><p>Again, I love 16:14:13:12 and design my favorite<br/>tunings to support either in JI (as here) or in near-just<br/>form. Whether it fits with this particular idiom, I&apos;m<br/>not sure, and maybe Arab or Turkish musicians could give<br/>a valuable perspective. But the Sikah idiom is something<br/>I use often, as well as 16;14:13:12 as a &quot;septimal Rast&quot;<br/>in its own right.</p><p>Also, your 36:29 at 374.3 cents is indeed only a bit<br/>wide of 26:21, and it turns out that in one location<br/>I have an odd interval of 704:567, which differs from<br/>36:29 by only 5104/5103 or 0.339 cents!</p><p>What&apos;s happening is that 704:567 is a variation on<br/>26:21, at 352:351 higher -- almost identical to the<br/>378:377 difference between your 36:29 and 26/21!</p><p>Anyway, this could get into a whole world of possible<br/>distinctions between ascending and descending motion --<br/>everything from harmonic and arithmetic or subharmonic<br/>series in relation to fine intonation, to rules of<br/>melody or counterpoint (e.g. in 16th-century Western<br/>European styles) that make distinctions depending on<br/>the direction on motion, such as the ordering of<br/>skips and steps, or larger and smaller skips.</p><p>I want to ponder your post more, but do want to give<br/>it a fair reply in a timely way.</p><p>With warmest thanks,</p><p>Margo</p></div>
