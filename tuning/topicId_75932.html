If so, I wonder what could be the<br/>smallest or the largest fifth possible to use as the generator.</p><p>Almost -- there are two generators -- one near 2/1 (or near<br/>the half octave sqrt(2)/1, etc) and one that defines the remaining<br/>terms. This is most familiarly the fifth, though it could be<br/>some other interval. Fixing the two generators at any<br/>specific values (like 2/1 and 3/2) defines a specific<br/>tuning of the intervals (in this case pythagorean) though<br/>as you can see from the slider in the video, there are many<br/>different tuning systems (some have names, and some don&apos;t)<br/>that can occur as you move the slider (i.e, as you change<br/>the values of the generators.</p><p>Petr continued:</p><p>&gt; I don&apos;t understand what was meant there by saying that the<br/>partials  of the played tones are made in tune with the intervals of<br/>the tuning.  Supposing that 5/4 is mapped to periods and generators<br/>as &quot;0 4&quot;, what happens if I go to schismatic temperaments where the<br/>mapping should be &quot;7 -8&quot;?</p><p>In TTSS, I talk about moving the partials of a sound in order<br/>to make them lie on the scale steps of a given tuning -- so for<br/>instance, you might move the partials of a sound from their harmonic<br/>position to the steps of the 10-edo scale -- this would tend to<br/>make some of the 10-edo intervals less dissonant (at least in<br/>&quot;sensory dissonance&quot; measure). Here, we&apos;re parameterizing<br/>both the tuning (via the two generators) and the timbre<br/>(also via the same two generators). So the partials of the<br/>sound change slightly as you change the generators, along with<br/>the tuning of the notes.</p><p>&gt; PS: Who was the speaker?</p><p>That&apos;s Jim Plamondon.

Because we were writing the two papers more<br/>or less simultaneously, we also tried to keep the terminology<br/>consistent between the two papers.<br/>But to answer less doulfully, yes, there are a<br/>number of terms coined in this group that are now in<br/>peer-reviewed journals. Of course, we referenced people here<br/>as much as possible... websites and even a few conversations<br/>on this forum.</p><p>&gt; Also on terminology, this article generally uses &quot;regular<br/>temperament&quot; to mean what I&apos;d call &quot;regular temperament<br/>class&quot; but not consistently so (pp.7,9).

This post is not about tunings as such, but about creating chord progressions in non-12 ET tunings. If this is off-topic here, is there perhaps some forum where such subjects are more suitable? Thank you.]</p><p>could you be more specific about your mentioned predictions on chord progressions, both too-restricted ones which only work for 12 ET and possibly also more general ones?</p><p>Here is a suggestion I can make for guidelines on good chord progressions, which is indeed based on the notion of pitch class sets, but which also works beyond 12 ET (e.g., I did examples using them with 31 ET). This suggestion is based on Schoenberg&apos;s guidelines on good chord root progressions where he introduces the notion of ascending (strong), descending (&apos;weak&apos;) and superstrong progressions (see the respective chapter in his Theory of Harmony). The summary of Schoenberg&apos;s guidelines/rules is based on 12 ET, but his explanation is actually more general. A formalisation of his explanations (instead of his actual rules) does work beyond 12 ET.</p><p>The main difference between Schoenberg&apos;s actual guidelines and their formalised generalisation is that Schoenberg&apos;s guidelines are based on scale degree intervals between chord roots, whereas the generalisation exploits whether the root pitch class of some chord is contained in the pitch class set of another chord. OK, it follows the core of is the formalisation (I hope the notation explains itself: defined are Boolean functions expecting two neighbouring chords).</p><p>/* Chord1 and Chord2 have common pitch classes, but the root of Chord2 does not occur in the set of Chord1&apos;s pitchclasses. */</p><p>isAscendingProgression(Chord1, Chord2) :=<br/>  ( NOT ( getRoot(Chord2) \in getPitchClasses(Chord1) ) )<br/>  AND ( intersection(getPitchClasses(Chord1), getPitchClasses(Chord2)) \= emptySet )</p><p>/* A non-root pitchclass of Chord1 is root in Chord2. */</p><p>isDescendingProgression(Chord1, Chord2) :=<br/>  ( getRoot(Chord2) \in getPitchClasses(Chord1) )<br/>  AND ( getRoot(Chord1) \= getRoot(Chord2) )</p><p>/* Chord1 and Chord2 have no common pitch classes */</p><p>isSuperstrongProgression(Chord1, Chord2) :=<br/>  intersection(getPitchClasses(Chord1), getPitchClasses(Chord2)) = emptySet</p><p>If you are interested I can post further formalisations/generalisations of Schoenberg&apos;s rules. For example, Schoenberg recommends that descending progressions should &quot;resolve&quot;. For any three successive chords, if the first two chords form a descending progression, then the progression from the first to the third chord should form a strong or superstrong progression (so the middle chord is quasi a &apos;passing chord&apos;). Also, Schoenberg observes that the more common pitches two neighbouring chords share the more &quot;weak&quot; this progression is. Based on that idea I defined a progression strength measurement which combines the definitions above and the cardinality of pitch class set intersections.</p><p>Anyway, for chord progressions of diatonic triads in major, the generalised formalisation and Schoenberg&apos;s rules are equivalent (e.g., the function isAscendingProgression above returns true for progressions which Schoenberg calls ascending). Still, the behaviour of the constraints and Schoenberg&apos;s rules differ for more complex cases. According to Schoenberg, a progression is superstrong if the root interval is a step up or down. For example, the progression V7 IV is superstrong according to Schoenberg. For the definitions above, however, this progression is descending (!), because the root of IV is contained in V7 (e.g. in G7 F, the F&apos;s root pitchclass f is already contained in G7). Indeed, this progression is rare in music. By contrast, the progression I IIIb (e.g., C Eb) is a descending progression in Schoenbergs original definition. For the definitions above, however, this is an ascending progression (the root of Es is not contained in C), and indeed for me the progression feels strong.</p><p>As I said, I used these definitions for generating chord progressions beyond 12 ET. As an example, I will sketch a simple rule set on a chord progression in 31 ET. Let us create a sequence of 5 chords and allow only for diatonic triads in C-major. The first and last chord should be the tonic. Following Schoenberg let us specify that ascending progressions are &quot;resolved&quot; (see above), and we don&apos;t allow for superstrong progressions. Finally, the union of the last three chords must contain all pitch classes of C-major (i.e. these chords form a cadence).</p><p>This problem has only two solutions (I used the computer :). These solutions are as follows. They happen to contain only ascending progressions. Such solutions are particularly convincing. For simplicity I given absolute chord names.</p><p>  C-maj F-maj D-min G-maj C-maj  (only ascending progressions)<br/>  C-maj A-min D-min G-maj C-maj  (only ascending progressions)</p><p>If instead of C-major we use the natural C-minor scale (and don&apos;t change anything else), there are only three solutions. Interestingly, these result in plagal cadences. Plagal cadences contain descending (&quot;weak&quot;) progressions, but they are all &quot;resolved&quot; by superstrong progressions. There exists no purely ascending progressions which form a cadence (where the union of chord pitch classes contains all scale notes).</p><p>  C-min G-min Bb-maj F-maj C-min<br/>  C-min F-min Bb-maj F-min C-min<br/>  C-min Eb-maj Bb-maj F-min C-min</p><p>Finally, here are the three only solutions in harmonic C-minor. The subdim chord here is 5:6:7 (root is 5), transposed to the specified root. Note that a progression F-dim G-maj would be descending according to Schoenberg (root progresses stepwise), but according to the definition above F-dim G-maj (and the F-subdim G-maj here) are strong progressions (the two chords share the pitch class B, but the root G is not contained in the former chord).</p><p>  C-min Ab-maj F-subdim G-maj C-min  (only ascending progressions)<br/>  C-min Eb-aug F-subdim G-maj C-min<br/>  C-min G-maj F-subdim G-maj C-min</p><p>Perhaps I should repeat that I did all this in 31 ET. These definitions work in principle with any pitch class sets, including just intonation where pitch class sets are ratios.</p><p>Comments are appreciated. Thank you!</p><p>Best<br/>Torsten</p><p>PS: I use the terms &quot;guidelines&quot; (and sometimes &quot;rules&quot;) instead of &quot;predictions&quot;, because I feel the latter is too strong (as others pointed out already here).

He mentions that H. Schenker uses these terms as well (&quot;aufsteigend&quot; and &quot;fallend&quot;) though in opposite meaning. He remarks something like that anyone who loves Brahmsian harmony would likely come up with similar concepts.</p><p>&gt; &gt; If you are interested I can post further formalisations/<br/>&gt; &gt; generalisations of Schoenberg&apos;s rules.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I would be interested to read them, especially if you<br/>&gt; show how you generalized them. And if monz is reading,<br/>&gt; I bet he&apos;d be interested, too.<br/>&gt;<br/>I&apos;ll write a new mail soon..</p><p>&gt; &gt; For example, Schoenberg<br/>&gt; &gt; recommends that descending progressions should &quot;resolve&quot;. For any<br/>&gt; &gt; three successive chords, if the first two chords form a descending<br/>&gt; &gt; progression, then the progression from the first to the third chord<br/>&gt; &gt; should form a strong or superstrong progression (so the middle chord<br/>&gt; &gt; is quasi a &apos;passing chord&apos;).<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Hm... this seems kindof strange.<br/>&gt;<br/>Schoenberg is always very exhaustive :) He does not want to ban descending progressions, so he looks for a way how he can allow for them in a way which is musically convincing in most cases. So, he comes up with the idea of a &apos;passing chord&apos;.</p><p>Please note that he makes is always very clear that his rules are guidelines for the pupil, but no laws for masterworks. This is why he prefers the term &quot;descending&quot; instead of &quot;weak&quot; progressions (he uses the term &quot;strong&quot; for &quot;ascending&quot; progressions a lot). Still, he does not discuss where descending progressions are used to good purpose in any masterwork, but such considerations have hardly a place anyway in his systematic approach.</p><p>&gt; &gt; Anyway, for chord progressions of diatonic triads in major, the<br/>&gt; &gt; generalised formalisation and Schoenberg&apos;s rules are equivalent<br/>&gt; &gt; (e.g., the function isAscendingProgression above returns true for<br/>&gt; &gt; progressions which Schoenberg calls ascending). Still, the behaviour<br/>&gt; &gt; of the constraints and Schoenberg&apos;s rules differ for more complex<br/>&gt; &gt; cases. According to Schoenberg, a progression is superstrong if the<br/>&gt; &gt; root interval is a step up or down.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Bzzz. :)<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; For example, the progression V7 IV is superstrong according to<br/>&gt; &gt; Schoenberg. For the definitions above, however, this progression<br/>&gt; &gt; is descending (!), because the root of IV is contained in V7<br/>&gt; &gt; (e.g. in G7 F, the F&apos;s root pitchclass f is already contained<br/>&gt; &gt; in G7). Indeed, this progression is rare in music.<br/>&gt; &gt; By contrast, the progression I IIIb (e.g., C Eb) is a descending<br/>&gt; &gt; progression in Schoenbergs original definition. For the<br/>&gt; &gt; definitions above, however, this is an ascending progression<br/>&gt; &gt; (the root of Es is not contained in C), and indeed for me the<br/>&gt; &gt; progression feels strong.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Sounds like we are really dealing with the Anders theory<br/>&gt; of chord progressions. Which is probably a blessing.<br/>&gt;<br/>:) As I said, I simply implemented Schoenberg&apos;s rule explanation instead of his actual rules. So, I cannot accept the honour you are implying.</p><p>&gt; &gt; Let us create a sequence of 5 chords and<br/>&gt; &gt; allow only for diatonic triads in C-major. The first and last<br/>&gt; &gt; chord should be the tonic. Following Schoenberg let us specify<br/>&gt; &gt; that ascending progressions are &quot;resolved&quot; (see above), and we<br/>&gt; &gt; don&apos;t allow for superstrong progressions. Finally, the union<br/>&gt; &gt; of the last three chords must contain all pitch classes of<br/>&gt; &gt; C-major (i.e. these chords form a cadence).<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; This problem has only two solutions (I used the computer :).<br/>&gt; &gt; These solutions are as follows. They happen to contain only<br/>&gt; &gt; ascending progressions. Such solutions are particularly<br/>&gt; &gt; convincing. For simplicity I given absolute chord names.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; C-maj F-maj D-min G-maj C-maj (only ascending progressions)<br/>&gt; &gt; C-maj A-min D-min G-maj C-maj (only ascending progressions)<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Only allowing for diatonic triads is C-major is a very<br/>&gt; helpful constraint. Howabout we allow all 7-limit triads<br/>&gt; in 31-ET, for a start?<br/>&gt;</p><p>The point of these generalised definitions is exactly that they allow for such cases :)  I only simplified for the sake of an argument. So, here is a 7-limit variant. Let the scale be septimal natural minor (Scala term, in 31 ET the pitches C D D# F G G# A#). Let us allow for the following septimal triads (please correct my terminology if necessary): harmonic diminished (5/5 6/5 7/5), subharmonic diminished (7/7 7/6 7/5), subminor (6/1 7/1 9/1), supermajor (1/9 1/7 1/6). Note that I consider all these chords as consonances for simplicity which require neither preparation nor resolution. Naturally, we could define extra rules which care for that.</p><p>There are 2 solutions of 5 chords with this scale, these chords and the rule set specified before. For convenience, I attached these solutions as PDF files (please let me know if doing so violates some policies of this list).</p><p>The solutions are shown by two staffs. The upper stuff shows the actual chord pitches (I didn&apos;t bother to implement voice leading rules here, so things like Bruckner&apos;s law of the shortest path are violated). The staff notation is in 31 ET (i.e. the interval C D# is 7/6). The lower staff shows the chord roots in staff notation plus there ratios expressed as a product of the untransposed chord ratios and a root factor for each chord ratio. Some of these factors may look odd at first, e.g., the first chord has the factor 4/3 for the root C, but this is due to that fact that the untransposed chord ratios don&apos;t contain 1/1 -- the resulting product ratios do contain 1/1.</p><p>If you are interested in other chord sets, scales, or longer solutions then just say so -- its easy to change some numbers in a computer program :)</p><p>Best<br/>Torsten</p><br/>

So, he comes up with the idea of a &apos;passing chord&apos;.</p><p>Let&apos;s not give Schoenberg too much credit as a music theorist.<br/>He was on the other hand one of the best composers ever<br/>known (at least until he started using his theory!).</p><p>Here is how I would do it:</p><p>root -&gt; root<br/>CM -&gt; Cmin (2 common tones)</p><p>root -&gt; tone<br/>CM -&gt; Amin (2 common tones)<br/>CM -&gt; FM (1 common tone)<br/>CM -&gt; Fmin (1 common tone)<br/>CM -&gt; AbM (1 common tone)</p><p>tone -&gt; root<br/>CM -&gt; Emin (2 common tones)<br/>CM -&gt; EM (1 common tone)<br/>CM -&gt; GM (1 common tone)<br/>CM -&gt; Gmin (1 common tone)</p><p>tone -&gt; tone<br/>CM -&gt; AM (1 common tone)<br/>CM -&gt; C#min (1 common tone)<br/>CM -&gt; EbM (1 common tone)</p><p>Now: how would we rate these progressions using our ears?<br/>I would be interested in your opinion, but already it is<br/>obvious that this theory cannot distinguish CM -&gt; EM from<br/>CM -&gt; GM, so it is missing something.</p><p>&gt; &gt; &gt; Let us create a sequence of 5 chords and<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; allow only for diatonic triads in C-major. The first and last<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; chord should be the tonic. Following Schoenberg let us specify<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; that ascending progressions are &quot;resolved&quot; (see above), and we<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; don&apos;t allow for superstrong progressions. Finally, the union<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; of the last three chords must contain all pitch classes of<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; C-major (i.e. these chords form a cadence).<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; This problem has only two solutions (I used the computer :).<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; These solutions are as follows. They happen to contain only<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; ascending progressions. Such solutions are particularly<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; convincing. For simplicity I given absolute chord names.<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; C-maj F-maj D-min G-maj C-maj (only ascending progressions)<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; C-maj A-min D-min G-maj C-maj (only ascending progressions)<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; Only allowing for diatonic triads is C-major is a very<br/>&gt; &gt; helpful constraint. Howabout we allow all 7-limit triads<br/>&gt; &gt; in 31-ET, for a start?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; The point of these generalised definitions is exactly that<br/>&gt; they allow for such cases :)  I only simplified for the sake<br/>&gt; of an argument.

This suggestion is based on Schoenberg&apos;s guidelines  &gt; on good chord root progressions where he introduces the notion of  &gt; ascending (strong), descending (&apos;weak&apos;) and superstrong progressions  &gt; (see the respective chapter in his Theory of Harmony). The summary of  &gt; Schoenberg&apos;s guidelines/rules is based on 12 ET, but his explanation  &gt; is actually more general. A formalisation of his explanations  &gt; (instead of his actual rules) does work beyond 12 ET.</p><p>I read a lot of Theory of Harmony several years ago.  (In fact I remember reading it during the boring lectures on matrices that have since turned out to be useful.)  I do remember these rules.  But at the time I applied them to 31 ET and didn&apos;t see any problem doing so.  Pitch class sets are a more modern concept that I don&apos;t see the need to bring in.</p><p>Now, Schoenberg&apos;s rules, and traditional theory in general, are tied to meantone temperament or something like it and a particular style of music assuming particular scales and conventions.  The don&apos;t automatically generalize to other contexts.  Schoenberg himself could hardly be accused of following the rules of 19th Century harmony too closely in his music.</p><p>I think it&apos;s an interesting idea to think about how harmony can be generalized.  One thing I&apos;ve concluded, after all these years, is that the rules given in harmony textbooks are often rules of thumb that happen to work within that context rather than rules of nature that you can expect to be more generally valid.  Behind it all I can identify two general rules:</p><p>1) Prefer descending fifths</p><p>2) Resolve by stepwise contrary motion</p><p>So, which is more important?</p><p>The issue of fifths is a tricky one.  For a wide range of music, from madrigals to blues, there&apos;s an expectation that chords are related by fifths.  Whether it&apos;s natural or not it&apos;s something listeners will expect.  But is it possible to establish other relationships that work as well in scales that don&apos;t have long chains of fifths?</p><p>Next, there&apos;s the issue of &quot;what is a step&quot;?  In miracle temperament (31&amp;41) I tried to follow the decimal scale.  I had rules to ensure &quot;steps&quot; were smaller than &quot;leaps&quot; and I avoided smaller intervals that could be heard as &quot;mistunings&quot;.  This lead to decimal counterpoint, for which I&apos;ve tracked down the examples now:</p><p><a href="http://x31eq.com/music/counterpoint.html">http://x31eq.com/music/counterpoint.html</a></p><p>I still haven&apos;t explained the theory but it&apos;s a generalization of Palestrina counterpoint as explained by Jeppesen and Fux.  I think it makes sense but it&apos;s still counterpoint rather than harmony.  There is a tendency for chords or modulations to be related by secors (the large semitones) because they&apos;re the generators of the scales.</p><p>Something I&apos;ve been thinking about lately is harmony in magic temperament (19&amp;22).  There, the simple scales naturally have lots of small semitones.  They&apos;re around the size George Secor identified as optimal for melody (1/22 to 1/19 instead of 1/17).  But the simple scales are very uneven, so you might have a few semitones and then a leap of a minor third.  I&apos;m wondering how much of a problem this would be in practice.  Unfortunately my keyboard&apos;s in another city so I&apos;m only speculating.</p><p>Chords will naturally be related by thirds rather than fifths.  It&apos;s difficult to get two consonances to resolve by these small semitones without parallel fifths but it&apos;s easy to resolve an augmented triad onto major or minor.  That violates the rule that a perfect cadence works because it relates two strong consonances.</p><p>All of which takes us a long way from Schoenberg.  I eventually gave up on the book because he spent all the time talking about particular chords when I&apos;m much more interested in general rules.  So, what rules do people find are helpful in navigating microtonal harmony?</p><p>                    Graham</p></div><h3><a id=75997 href="#75997">ðŸ”—</a>Torsten Anders &#x3C;torstenanders@gmx.de&#x3E;</h3><span>4/23/2008 6:22:29 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Dear Carl,</p><p>On Apr 23, 2008, at 12:35 AM, Carl Lumma wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; By assuming a scale you&apos;re guaranteeing valid results.<br/>&gt; Or at least limiting the poorness of the results.

I did some examples which start in C, use only ascending/strong progressions, wander through keys so to speak, but end again in C major with some sort of a cadence. We could use, e.g., some septimal scale instead for a cadence, but leaving any cadence off entirely or ending in another key feels less convincing (less closed) for me.

Nevertheless, I feel you shouldn&apos;t make such a statement if you haven&apos;t read his theoretical works (as you mentioned before). Many theorists agree that Schoenberg is one of the most important music theorists of the 20th century. BTW, he certainly did not directly &quot;use&quot; any of his published theoretical works for his own compositions, as these books are meant for teaching and are much more conservative than his compositions. Nevertheless, these writings try to understand why common practise works the way it works and he uses this also extrapolate from common practise to new possibilities.</p><p>&gt; Here is how I would do it:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; root -&gt; root<br/>&gt; CM -&gt; Cmin (2 common tones)<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; root -&gt; tone<br/>&gt; CM -&gt; Amin (2 common tones)<br/>&gt; CM -&gt; FM (1 common tone)<br/>&gt; CM -&gt; Fmin (1 common tone)<br/>&gt; CM -&gt; AbM (1 common tone)<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; tone -&gt; root<br/>&gt; CM -&gt; Emin (2 common tones)<br/>&gt; CM -&gt; EM (1 common tone)<br/>&gt; CM -&gt; GM (1 common tone)<br/>&gt; CM -&gt; Gmin (1 common tone)<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; tone -&gt; tone<br/>&gt; CM -&gt; AM (1 common tone)<br/>&gt; CM -&gt; C#min (1 common tone)<br/>&gt; CM -&gt; EbM (1 common tone)<br/>&gt;</p><p>I am not sure I follow.

I extrapolated Schoenberg&apos;s rules for non-diatonic cases (e.g., CM -&gt; C#min), but I don&apos;t feel 100% sure whether I am correct about his opinion for such non-diatonic cases as he does not discuss them explicitly in terms of root progressions (as far as I remember).</p><p>constant root &quot;progression&quot; (not considered by Schoenberg when discussing root progressions)<br/>CM -&gt; Cmin (2 common tones)</p><p>ascending progressions (strong)<br/>CM -&gt; Amin (2 common tones)<br/>CM -&gt; FM (1 common tone)<br/>CM -&gt; Fmin (1 common tone)<br/>CM -&gt; AbM (1 common tone)<br/>CM -&gt; AM (1 common tone)<br/>CM -&gt; C#min (1 common tone) [is superstrong after Schoenberg]<br/>CM -&gt; EbM (1 common tone) [is descending after Schoenberg]</p><p>descending progressions<br/>CM -&gt; Emin (2 common tones)<br/>CM -&gt; EM (1 common tone)<br/>CM -&gt; GM (1 common tone)<br/>CM -&gt; Gmin (1 common tone)</p><p>superstrong progressions (e.g., used in deceptive cadence)<br/>CM -&gt; DM<br/>CM -&gt; Dmin<br/>CM -&gt; C#M<br/>CM -&gt; BM<br/>CM -&gt; Bmin<br/>CM -&gt; BbM<br/>CM -&gt; Bbmin<br/>CM -&gt; Ebmin [descending after Schoenberg]<br/>CM -&gt; F#M [probably ascending after Schoenberg]<br/>CM -&gt; F#min [probably ascending after Schoenberg]<br/>CM -&gt; Abmin [ascending after Schoenberg]</p><p>&gt; Now: how would we rate these progressions using our ears?<br/>&gt; I would be interested in your opinion, but already it is<br/>&gt; obvious that this theory cannot distinguish CM -&gt; EM from<br/>&gt; CM -&gt; GM, so it is missing something.</p><p>I see what you mean.

Of course, we cannot have only descending fifths in JI (we would never get &quot;back&quot;), but we can write music where most root progressions are of this kind.</p><p>It would be interesting to explore how we can create convincing chord progressions where the roots are not all &quot;stringed&quot; on the 3-dimension of the lattice. 19th century harmony did this a lot, and this is also a domain explored in Schoenberg&apos;s harmony (his guidelines are not restricted to fifths progressions).</p><p>Yet, 19th century harmony is of course restricted to 5-limit -- its root progressions certainly are. Meanwhile, we realised that 7-limit and beyond can be fruitful to for harmony. So, my question is how can we create convincing chord progressions beyond 5-limit? Can we find some guidelines which simplify the composition process, much like the guidelines of 5-limit harmony did for former centuries.</p><p>I feel it can be a good idea trying to understand the underlying principles of previous guidelines so that these can be generalised for new music. A comparable example may be Erlich&apos;s decatonic scales which generalise principles underlying diatonic scales (and meantone temperament) in order to find scales for 7-limit.</p><p>I really like such an approach. So, I tried to generalise some principles underlying 5-limit chord progressions. The most thorough discussion of these which I could find so far are Schoenberg&apos;s two harmony books. Some underlying principles I hope I have found in Schoenberg&apos;s explanation of his guidelines for root progressions. Therefore, I formalised his explanation, and not his actual rules.</p><p>You mention that you could apply his rules to 31 ET. That&apos;s of could right, you can do that (in my former mail I mentioned 12 ET, because I reacted to Carl dispraise of music theory approaches restricted to 12 ET). However, you can only create 5-limit root progressions that way (naturally, you may stagger higher-limit chords on top). My generalised guidelines, on the other hand, at least formally also work for 7-limit (or any other limit).</p><p>Now, my question is of could do these generalised guidelines also result in chord progressions which convince musically? Or did I just some formal exercise here?</p><p>I would greatly appreciate comments in critics in this regard (e.g., by criticising the example progressions I sent in multiple mails before).</p><p>Even more so, I would like to hear alternative guidelines for creating chord progression where root relations are beyond 5-limit.</p><p>I should perhaps mention some guideline related to my generalised guidelines: prefer chord progressions which share common tones (a harmonic band in Schoenberg&apos;s terminology). The guidelines I detailed before are more precise that this harmonic-band-guideline.</p><p>&gt; 2) Resolve by stepwise contrary motion<br/>&gt;<br/>I&apos;m sorry, but we may talk at cross-purposes here. Melodic motion is of course also important for chord progressions, but is a different matter (and you simplify it too :). So far, I was solely talking about chord root progressions, only a sub-aspect of harmony in general. Of course, there are other important aspects in harmony, which I left out for simplicity. For example, there is the treatment of dissonances (e.g., what is a dissonance, are they prepared and how, are they resolved and how). This matter is related to root progressions in the sense that dissonances are often resolved by strong harmonic progressions (V7 -&gt; 1). There are also melodic considerations concerning the treatment of dissonances (e.g., dissonances are most smoothly resolved by a step downwards), but these might be somewhat less crucial than the harmonic progression resolving a dissonance (e.g., if V7 is resolved in I but the 7th is not directly leading into the 3th of I, we may still feel it is OK). Moreover, there is the aspect of how chords are related to a scale and how the underlying scale can change (modulation). And there are further aspects (e.g., chords can be inserted or left out of a progression etc.).</p><p>Now, besides all this there is of course also the field of counterpoint. I assume you are referring to that.</p><p>&gt; So, which is more important?<br/>&gt;</p><p>If your where referring to counterpoint with your remark, then there can be no definite answer to this question. In some historical periods, the contrapuntal organisation of melodic motion was more important. At others, harmony dominated. I might say that it is a good thing to have both, but that is only a personal preference.</p><p>&gt; The issue of fifths is a tricky one. For a wide range of<br/>&gt; music, from madrigals to blues, there&apos;s an expectation that<br/>&gt; chords are related by fifths. Whether it&apos;s natural or not<br/>&gt; it&apos;s something listeners will expect. But is it possible to<br/>&gt; establish other relationships that work as well in scales<br/>&gt; that don&apos;t have long chains of fifths?<br/>&gt;<br/>I agree in general and certainly for the blues (see also discussion above). I am not so sure about madrigals though, many go beyond that. For example, many root progressions in Gesualdo&apos;s work are 5-limit.</p><p>&gt; Next, there&apos;s the issue of &quot;what is a step&quot;? In miracle<br/>&gt; temperament (31&amp;41) I tried to follow the decimal scale. I<br/>&gt; had rules to ensure &quot;steps&quot; were smaller than &quot;leaps&quot; and I<br/>&gt; avoided smaller intervals that could be heard as<br/>&gt; &quot;mistunings&quot;. This lead to decimal counterpoint, for which<br/>&gt; I&apos;ve tracked down the examples now:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; <a href="http://x31eq.com/music/counterpoint.html">http://x31eq.com/music/counterpoint.html</a><br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I still haven&apos;t explained the theory but it&apos;s a<br/>&gt; generalization of Palestrina counterpoint as explained by<br/>&gt; Jeppesen and Fux. I think it makes sense but it&apos;s still<br/>&gt; counterpoint rather than harmony. There is a tendency for<br/>&gt; chords or modulations to be related by secors (the large<br/>&gt; semitones) because they&apos;re the generators of the scales.<br/>&gt;<br/>I would like to read the theory behind these.</p><p>&gt; Something I&apos;ve been thinking about lately is harmony in<br/>&gt; magic temperament (19&amp;22). There, the simple scales<br/>&gt; naturally have lots of small semitones. They&apos;re around the<br/>&gt; size George Secor identified as optimal for melody (1/22 to<br/>&gt; 1/19 instead of 1/17). But the simple scales are very<br/>&gt; uneven, so you might have a few semitones and then a leap of<br/>&gt; a minor third. I&apos;m wondering how much of a problem this<br/>&gt; would be in practice. Unfortunately my keyboard&apos;s in<br/>&gt; another city so I&apos;m only speculating.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Chords will naturally be related by thirds rather than<br/>&gt; fifths. It&apos;s difficult to get two consonances to resolve by<br/>&gt; these small semitones without parallel fifths but it&apos;s easy<br/>&gt; to resolve an augmented triad onto major or minor. That<br/>&gt; violates the rule that a perfect cadence works because it<br/>&gt; relates two strong consonances.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; All of which takes us a long way from Schoenberg. I<br/>&gt; eventually gave up on the book because he spent all the time<br/>&gt; talking about particular chords when I&apos;m much more<br/>&gt; interested in general rules.<br/>&gt;<br/>I understand why you felt that way, but you meanwhile may also understand why I don&apos;t agree here :)</p><p>&gt; Pitch class sets<br/>&gt; are a more modern concept that I don&apos;t see the need to bring in.<br/>&gt;<br/>I am using the pitch class notion in a generalised sense: a pitch where the octave component is neglected. I understood that this notion is common in microtonal music as well. For example, it means exactly the same as Doty&apos;s &quot;Primer&quot; denotes with the term &quot;identity&quot; (e.g., 5/1 is an identity and a pitch class). Using the notion of sets to refer to multiple pitch classes (identities) allows then to speak precisely about relations of multiple chords etc. and formalise such relations. Would you suggest an alternative concept instead for this purpose?</p><p>I assume Schoenberg did not use the term pitch class. But the composer who likely composed the most important dodecaphonic pieces we have certainly knew exactly what is meant by this term.</p><p>&gt; So, what rules do people find<br/>&gt; are helpful in navigating microtonal harmony?<br/>&gt;<br/>Exactly the question I was addressing :) I would greatly welcome alternative proposals.</p><p>Best<br/>Torsten</p><p>--<br/>Torsten Anders<br/>Interdisciplinary Centre for Computer Music Research<br/>University of Plymouth<br/>Office: +44-1752-233667<br/>Private: +44-1752-558917<br/><a href="http://strasheela.sourceforge.net">http://strasheela.sourceforge.net</a><br/><a href="http://www.torsten-anders.de">http://www.torsten-anders.de</a></p></div><h3><a id=76001 href="#76001">ðŸ”—</a>Torsten Anders &#x3C;torstenanders@gmx.de&#x3E;</h3><span>4/23/2008 9:55:11 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Dear Hans Straub,</p><p>thank you for your links (and for compiling these FAQs in the first place).

Yes, I could probably generalize<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; many (though not all) of the &quot;bad music theory papers&quot; if I<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; worked at it. And some such minimal effort would only be<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; fair in the meta-analysis I proposed. Where to draw the line<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; is another question.<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; Did Schoenberg say the important thing<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; is whether the root is a member of the new chord (which is<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; a reasonable thing)? Or did he say something else?<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; Sorry, I don&apos;t fully understand your question.

He mentions that H. Schenker uses &gt; these<br/>&gt; &gt; terms as well (&quot;aufsteigend&quot; and &quot;fallend&quot;) though in opposite<br/>&gt; &gt; meaning. He remarks something like that anyone who loves Brahmsian<br/>&gt; &gt; harmony would likely come up with similar concepts.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; If you are interested I can post further formalisations/<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; generalisations of Schoenberg&apos;s rules.<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; I would be interested to read them, especially if you<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; show how you generalized them. And if monz is reading,<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; I bet he&apos;d be interested, too.<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; I&apos;ll write a new mail soon..<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; For example, Schoenberg<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; recommends that descending progressions should &quot;resolve&quot;. For &gt; any<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; three successive chords, if the first two chords form a &gt; descending<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; progression, then the progression from the first to the third &gt; chord<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; should form a strong or superstrong progression (so the &gt; middle chord<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; is quasi a &apos;passing chord&apos;).<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; Hm... this seems kindof strange.<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; Schoenberg is always very exhaustive :) He does not want to ban<br/>&gt; &gt; descending progressions, so he looks for a way how he can allow for<br/>&gt; &gt; them in a way which is musically convincing in most cases. So, he<br/>&gt; &gt; comes up with the idea of a &apos;passing chord&apos;.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; Please note that he makes is always very clear that his rules are<br/>&gt; &gt; guidelines for the pupil, but no laws for masterworks. This is &gt; why he<br/>&gt; &gt; prefers the term &quot;descending&quot; instead of &quot;weak&quot; progressions (he &gt; uses<br/>&gt; &gt; the term &quot;strong&quot; for &quot;ascending&quot; progressions a lot). Still, he &gt; does<br/>&gt; &gt; not discuss where descending progressions are used to good &gt; purpose in<br/>&gt; &gt; any masterwork, but such considerations have hardly a place &gt; anyway in<br/>&gt; &gt; his systematic approach.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Anyway, for chord progressions of diatonic triads in major, the<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; generalised formalisation and Schoenberg&apos;s rules are equivalent<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; (e.g., the function isAscendingProgression above returns true &gt; for<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; progressions which Schoenberg calls ascending). Still, the &gt; behaviour<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; of the constraints and Schoenberg&apos;s rules differ for more &gt; complex<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; cases. According to Schoenberg, a progression is superstrong &gt; if the<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; root interval is a step up or down.<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; Bzzz. :)<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; For example, the progression V7 IV is superstrong according to<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Schoenberg. For the definitions above, however, this progression<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; is descending (!), because the root of IV is contained in V7<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; (e.g. in G7 F, the F&apos;s root pitchclass f is already contained<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; in G7). Indeed, this progression is rare in music.<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; By contrast, the progression I IIIb (e.g., C Eb) is a descending<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; progression in Schoenbergs original definition. For the<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; definitions above, however, this is an ascending progression<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; (the root of Es is not contained in C), and indeed for me the<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; progression feels strong.<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; Sounds like we are really dealing with the Anders theory<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; of chord progressions. Which is probably a blessing.<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; :) As I said, I simply implemented Schoenberg&apos;s rule explanation<br/>&gt; &gt; instead of his actual rules. So, I cannot accept the honour you are<br/>&gt; &gt; implying.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Let us create a sequence of 5 chords and<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; allow only for diatonic triads in C-major. The first and last<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; chord should be the tonic. Following Schoenberg let us specify<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; that ascending progressions are &quot;resolved&quot; (see above), and we<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; don&apos;t allow for superstrong progressions. Finally, the union<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; of the last three chords must contain all pitch classes of<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; C-major (i.e. these chords form a cadence).<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; This problem has only two solutions (I used the computer :).<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; These solutions are as follows. They happen to contain only<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; ascending progressions. Such solutions are particularly<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; convincing. For simplicity I given absolute chord names.<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; C-maj F-maj D-min G-maj C-maj (only ascending progressions)<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; C-maj A-min D-min G-maj C-maj (only ascending progressions)<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; Only allowing for diatonic triads is C-major is a very<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; helpful constraint. Howabout we allow all 7-limit triads<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; in 31-ET, for a start?<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; The point of these generalised definitions is exactly that they &gt; allow<br/>&gt; &gt; for such cases :) I only simplified for the sake of an argument. So,<br/>&gt; &gt; here is a 7-limit variant. Let the scale be septimal natural minor<br/>&gt; &gt; (Scala term, in 31 ET the pitches C D D# F G G# A#). Let us allow &gt; for<br/>&gt; &gt; the following septimal triads (please correct my terminology if<br/>&gt; &gt; necessary): harmonic diminished (5/5 6/5 7/5), subharmonic &gt; diminished<br/>&gt; &gt; (7/7 7/6 7/5), subminor (6/1 7/1 9/1), supermajor (1/9 1/7 1/6). &gt; Note<br/>&gt; &gt; that I consider all these chords as consonances for simplicity which<br/>&gt; &gt; require neither preparation nor resolution. Naturally, we could<br/>&gt; &gt; define extra rules which care for that.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; There are 2 solutions of 5 chords with this scale, these chords and<br/>&gt; &gt; the rule set specified before. For convenience, I attached these<br/>&gt; &gt; solutions as PDF files (please let me know if doing so violates some<br/>&gt; &gt; policies of this list).<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; The solutions are shown by two staffs. The upper stuff shows the<br/>&gt; &gt; actual chord pitches (I didn&apos;t bother to implement voice leading<br/>&gt; &gt; rules here, so things like Bruckner&apos;s law of the shortest path are<br/>&gt; &gt; violated). The staff notation is in 31 ET (i.e. the interval C D# is<br/>&gt; &gt; 7/6). The lower staff shows the chord roots in staff notation plus<br/>&gt; &gt; there ratios expressed as a product of the untransposed chord ratios<br/>&gt; &gt; and a root factor for each chord ratio. Some of these factors may<br/>&gt; &gt; look odd at first, e.g., the first chord has the factor 4/3 for the<br/>&gt; &gt; root C, but this is due to that fact that the untransposed chord<br/>&gt; &gt; ratios don&apos;t contain 1/1 -- the resulting product ratios do &gt; contain 1/1.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; If you are interested in other chord sets, scales, or longer<br/>&gt; &gt; solutions then just say so -- its easy to change some numbers in a<br/>&gt; &gt; computer program :)<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; Best<br/>&gt; &gt; Torsten<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; --<br/>&gt; &gt; Torsten Anders<br/>&gt; &gt; Interdisciplinary Centre for Computer Music Research<br/>&gt; &gt; University of Plymouth<br/>&gt; &gt; Office: +44-1752-233667<br/>&gt; &gt; Private: +44-1752-558917<br/>&gt; &gt; <a href="http://strasheela.sourceforge.net">http://strasheela.sourceforge.net</a><br/>&gt; &gt; <a href="http://www.torsten-anders.de">http://www.torsten-anders.de</a><br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>--<br/>Torsten Anders<br/>Interdisciplinary Centre for Computer Music Research<br/>University of Plymouth<br/>Office: +44-1752-233667<br/>Private: +44-1752-558917<br/><a href="http://strasheela.sourceforge.net">http://strasheela.sourceforge.net</a><br/><a href="http://www.torsten-anders.de">http://www.torsten-anders.de</a></p></div><h3><a id=76005 href="#76005">ðŸ”—</a>Carl Lumma &#x3C;carl@lumma.org&#x3E;</h3><span>4/23/2008 1:07:40 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Hi Torsten,</p><p>&gt; Even more so, I would like to hear alternative guidelines<br/>&gt; for creating chord progression where root relations are<br/>&gt; beyond 5-limit.</p><p>Don&apos;t want to butt in here between you and Graham, but I<br/>thought I&apos;d point out that the roots of many higher-limit<br/>chords are ill-defined by current theory.</p><p>-Carl</p></div><h3><a id=76006 href="#76006">ðŸ”—</a>Carl Lumma &#x3C;carl@lumma.org&#x3E;</h3><span>4/23/2008 1:31:58 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Hi Torsten,</p><p>&gt; &gt; By assuming a scale you&apos;re guaranteeing valid results.<br/>&gt; &gt; Or at least limiting the poorness of the results. I meant<br/>&gt; &gt; all 7-limit chords in 31-ET. This is the kind of stuff<br/>&gt; &gt; we cut our teeth on around here. :)<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Sorry for contradicting, but using a scale is by no means<br/>&gt; &quot;guaranteeing valid results&quot;. Here is an extreme counter-example<br/>&gt; in C-maj, which is only uses diatonic chords but does not follow<br/>&gt; the  mentioned guidelines. This progression has not even a<br/>&gt; &quot;harmonic band&quot; (common tones) between chords (it still does a<br/>&gt; &quot;cadence&quot; in the sense that the last three chords express all<br/>&gt; scale degrees).<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; CM Dmin Emin Dmin CM<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; More to the point, there are quite a lot of different diatonic<br/>&gt; progressions of 5 chords possible in C-major. I was surprised<br/>&gt; when I realised that only two (!) 5-chord progressions follow<br/>&gt; the rule set I described. I would not argue that there are no<br/>&gt; other good sounding progressions, but I find it remarkable that<br/>&gt; this rule set only finds particularly common progressions.</p><p>If I had a nickel for every paper that starts with the diatonic<br/>scale, applies some rules, and winds up with the central<br/>cadences of common practice music, I&apos;d be a rich man.  :)<br/>Even Rothenberg had a way to get them, based on his pattern<br/>recognition model.</p><p>&gt; Anyway, we can certainly also do non-diatonic 7-limit chord<br/>&gt; progressions. I did some examples which start in C, use only<br/>&gt; ascending/strong progressions, wander through keys so to speak,<br/>&gt; but end again in C major with some sort of a cadence.//<br/>&gt; Naturally, there exist many such progressions. I uploaded a<br/>&gt; few examples to<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; <a href="/tuning/files/TorstenAnders/">/tuning/files/TorstenAnders/</a><br/>&gt; ChordProgressions/ChordProgression-*<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; The same limitations are mentioned before apply: no voice-leading<br/>&gt; rules applied for simplicity and no preparation or resolution of<br/>&gt; any dissonances.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; In an actual composition, I would likely further structure a<br/>&gt; progression, e.g., have some sub-progressions which are repeated<br/>&gt; in different transpositions. These may then coincide with motif<br/>&gt; relations. In a first attempt, I did chord progressions where<br/>&gt; the transposition interval and the chord &quot;type&quot; (i.e. in<br/>&gt; intervallic relations within the chord) repeat every four<br/>&gt; chords as in a sequence.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I uploaded these examples to<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; <a href="/tuning/files/TorstenAnders/">/tuning/files/TorstenAnders/</a><br/>&gt; ChordProgressions/ChordProg-wSequence-*<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Comments and recommendations for better approaches are of<br/>&gt; course appreciated :)</p><p>Wonderful work, simply fantastic.  One could spend several<br/>lifetimes writing music around such progressions.  I would<br/>probably have put the examples at a somewhat lower pitch...<br/>What is your workflow for producing the notation?</p><p>&quot;These ratios automatically derived from the 31 ET pitch<br/>classes&quot;... using Strasheela, I take it.  Wow, very powerful.</p><p>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; For example, Schoenberg<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; recommends that descending progressions should &quot;resolve&quot;.<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; For any three successive chords, if the first two chords<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; form a descending progression, then the progression from<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; the first to the third chord should form a strong or<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; superstrong progression (so the middle chord<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; is quasi a &apos;passing chord&apos;).<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Hm... this seems kindof strange.<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; Schoenberg is always very exhaustive :) He does not want to<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; ban descending progressions, so he looks for a way how he<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; can allow for them in a way which is musically convincing<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; in most cases. So, he comes up with the idea of a &apos;passing<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; chord&apos;.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; Let&apos;s not give Schoenberg too much credit as a music theorist.<br/>&gt; &gt; He was on the other hand one of the best composers ever<br/>&gt; &gt; known (at least until he started using his theory!).<br/>//<br/>&gt; I feel you shouldn&apos;t make such a statement if you haven&apos;t<br/>&gt; read his theoretical works (as you mentioned before).</p><p>You&apos;re right.  I did actually read a few pages from his<br/>book on one occasion, but it isn&apos;t enough to go on.</p><p>&gt; Many theorists agree that Schoenberg is one of the most<br/>&gt; important music theorists of the 20th century. BTW, he<br/>&gt; certainly did not directly &quot;use&quot; any of his published<br/>&gt; theoretical works for his own compositions, as these books<br/>&gt; are meant for teaching and are much more conservative than<br/>&gt; his compositions. Nevertheless, these writings try to<br/>&gt; understand why common practise works the way it works and<br/>&gt; he uses this also extrapolate from common practise to new<br/>&gt; possibilities.</p><p>I thought his works could (roughly) be divided into<br/>pre- and post- 12-tone technique periods (?).</p><p>&gt; &gt; Here is how I would do it:<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; root -&gt; root<br/>&gt; &gt; CM -&gt; Cmin (2 common tones)<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; root -&gt; tone<br/>&gt; &gt; CM -&gt; Amin (2 common tones)<br/>&gt; &gt; CM -&gt; FM (1 common tone)<br/>&gt; &gt; CM -&gt; Fmin (1 common tone)<br/>&gt; &gt; CM -&gt; AbM (1 common tone)<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; tone -&gt; root<br/>&gt; &gt; CM -&gt; Emin (2 common tones)<br/>&gt; &gt; CM -&gt; EM (1 common tone)<br/>&gt; &gt; CM -&gt; GM (1 common tone)<br/>&gt; &gt; CM -&gt; Gmin (1 common tone)<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; tone -&gt; tone<br/>&gt; &gt; CM -&gt; AM (1 common tone)<br/>&gt; &gt; CM -&gt; C#min (1 common tone)<br/>&gt; &gt; CM -&gt; EbM (1 common tone)<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I am not sure I follow. I assume you mean by &quot;root -&gt; tone&quot;<br/>&gt; that the root of the second chord was no chord tone in the<br/>&gt; previous chord,</p><p>That the second chord contains the root of the first as a<br/>non-root tone.  It happens that this also means what you say<br/>here is true.</p><p>&gt; and by &quot;tone -&gt; root&quot; that the root of the second chord was<br/>&gt; some non-root tone of the previous.</p><p>Yes.</p><p>&gt; But what is then &quot;tone -&gt; tone&quot;? Could you please explain?</p><p>Some non-root tone of the first chord is a non-root tone<br/>in the second.  Hopefully the examples will help.</p><p>&gt; Just as an illustration, I resort your chords according to<br/>&gt; the category formalisation I discussed in my first mail<br/>//<br/>&gt; constant root &quot;progression&quot;<br/>&gt; CM -&gt; Cmin (2 common tones)<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; ascending progressions (strong)<br/>&gt; CM -&gt; Amin (2 common tones)<br/>&gt; CM -&gt; FM (1 common tone)<br/>&gt; CM -&gt; Fmin (1 common tone)<br/>&gt; CM -&gt; AbM (1 common tone)<br/>&gt; CM -&gt; AM (1 common tone)<br/>&gt; CM -&gt; C#min (1 common tone) [is superstrong after Schoenberg]<br/>&gt; CM -&gt; EbM (1 common tone) [is descending after Schoenberg]<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; descending progressions<br/>&gt; CM -&gt; Emin (2 common tones)<br/>&gt; CM -&gt; EM (1 common tone)<br/>&gt; CM -&gt; GM (1 common tone)<br/>&gt; CM -&gt; Gmin (1 common tone)</p><p>Yes.  The classification I gave is directional; your<br/>implementation of Schoenberg&apos;s is not.  This means that<br/>whereas I have distinguished between root-&gt;tone and<br/>tone-&gt;root, S. considers them together.  So it seems the<br/>simplest definitions for S.&apos;s terms are:</p><p>ascending progression - two chords having at least one<br/>common tone which is a root in one of the chords</p><p>descending progression - two chords having at least<br/>one common tone which are not roots of either chord.</p><p>Listening to the examples, I don&apos;t hear evidence that the<br/>direction matters, but I thought I should expose it to<br/>test this.</p><p>&gt; &gt; Now: how would we rate these progressions using our ears?<br/>&gt; &gt; I would be interested in your opinion, but already it is<br/>&gt; &gt; obvious that this theory cannot distinguish CM -&gt; EM from<br/>&gt; &gt; CM -&gt; GM, so it is missing something.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I see what you mean. Shall we complement the formalisation<br/>&gt; by some harmonic distance, e.g., distance of the chords on<br/>&gt; the lattice?  (e.g., sum of Tenney harmonic distance of all<br/>&gt; chord tones divided by the tone number??). EMaj is more<br/>&gt; remote on the lattice from CMaj than GMaj is.</p><p>Yes, this would be one sensible approach.</p><p>In fact I would suggest that the strength of the perceived<br/>change between two chords is the sum of the Tenney-weighted<br/>harmonic distances between pairs of changing tones in the<br/>ensemble, arranged so that this sum is minimal.  Let me<br/>explain...</p><p>The &quot;ensemble&quot; is the set of pitches needed to perform<br/>both chords.</p><p>&quot;changing pitches&quot;: every pitch in the ensemble not<br/>occurring in both chords.</p><p>For a pair of changing pitches, the Tenney-weighted<br/>harmonic distance between them is<br/>    log2(TenneyHeight(pitchA - pitchB))<br/>where<br/>    pitchA &gt;= pitchB<br/>and<br/>    TenneyHeight(p/q) = p*q</p><p>For temperaments, we mean the approximations to pitchA<br/>and pitchB in just intonation.</p><p>So in the example CM -&gt; Cmin, the changing pitches are<br/>E &lt;-&gt; Eb, which are approximately 5/4 &lt;-&gt; 6/5 in just<br/>intonation.  5/4 - 6/5 = 25/24, and log2(600) = 9.23.<br/>Compare this to CM -&gt; Amin, where log2(10*9) = 6.49.</p><p>If there is only 1 changing pitch in the enemble (for<br/>example C-E-G-Bb -&gt; C-E-G, where the changing pitch<br/>is Bb), then the &quot;perceived change strength&quot; between<br/>the chords shall be zero.</p><p>If there are more than 2 changing pitches, we find the<br/>pairing for which the sum of the harmonic distances is<br/>minimal.  This includes the ability to exclude the most<br/>distant pitch in case there are an odd number of pitches.</p><p>Back in the original example (CM-&gt;GM vs. CM-&gt;EM), we<br/>have<br/>    C&lt;-&gt;D + E&lt;-&gt;B = 8.75 for CM-&gt;GM<br/>and<br/>    G&lt;-&gt;B + C&lt;-&gt;G# = 12.97 for CM-&gt;EM<br/>So perhaps it&apos;s working.  We should calculate values for<br/>all of the progressions in my table and see if they make<br/>sense.</p><p>This method should be completely general for higher limits,<br/>and would even claim to measure the strength of progressions<br/>between chords of different sizes (tetrads, triads, etc.)<br/>on the same scale.</p><p>-Carl</p></div><h3><a id=76016 href="#76016">ðŸ”—</a>Graham Breed &#x3C;gbreed@gmail.com&#x3E;</h3><span>4/24/2008 6:46:18 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Torsten Anders wrote:</p><p>&gt;&gt; I think it&apos;s an interesting idea to think about how harmony<br/>&gt;&gt; can be generalized. One thing I&apos;ve concluded, after all<br/>&gt;&gt; these years, is that the rules given in harmony textbooks<br/>&gt;&gt; are often rules of thumb that happen to work within that<br/>&gt;&gt; context rather than rules of nature that you can expect to<br/>&gt;&gt; be more generally valid. Behind it all I can identify two<br/>&gt;&gt; general rules:<br/>&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt; 1) Prefer descending fifths<br/>&gt; &gt; Sure, decending fifths are the most important root progression in  &gt; many musical styles. For example, in Jazz you can have astonishingly  &gt; complex chord progressions which are all understood as II V I  &gt; progressions.<br/>&gt; &gt; We can directly apply the idea to microtonal harmony where we could  &gt; have root progressions only along the 3-dimension of the lattice and  &gt; then stagger various chords on top of these roots. Of course, we  &gt; cannot have only descending fifths in JI (we would never get &quot;back&quot;),  &gt; but we can write music where most root progressions are of this kind.</p><p>Conventional harmony doesn&apos;t use only descending fifths anyway.  But you can work forwards and backwards until you have chords with common notes and make the join that way. With other temperament classes you may not even have enough fifths to do that given a reasonable number of notes.</p><p>&gt; It would be interesting to explore how we can create convincing chord  &gt; progressions where the roots are not all &quot;stringed&quot; on the 3- &gt; dimension of the lattice. 19th century harmony did this a lot, and  &gt; this is also a domain explored in Schoenberg&apos;s harmony (his  &gt; guidelines are not restricted to fifths progressions).</p><p>The simplest thing in magic is to go up in thirds and then down a fifth.</p><p>&gt; Yet, 19th century harmony is of course restricted to 5-limit -- its  &gt; root progressions certainly are. Meanwhile, we realised that 7-limit  &gt; and beyond can be fruitful to for harmony. So, my question is how can  &gt; we create convincing chord progressions beyond 5-limit? Can we find  &gt; some guidelines which simplify the composition process, much like the  &gt; guidelines of 5-limit harmony did for former centuries.</p><p>9-limit chords are interesting.  You get a 6:7:9 subminor triad with a bluesey feel that seems to work well enough as well as its opposite, the car horn supermajor triad. Because they&apos;re still traids they have clear roots and follow voice leading rules.  7 odd-limit triads (other than the 5-limit) don&apos;t fit so well.</p><p>&gt; I feel it can be a good idea trying to understand the underlying  &gt; principles of previous guidelines so that these can be generalised  &gt; for new music. A comparable example may be Erlich&apos;s decatonic scales  &gt; which generalise principles underlying diatonic scales (and meantone  &gt; temperament) in order to find scales for 7-limit.</p><p>I think the decatonics are the best theory we have so far and the only way to improve on them is with more experience.</p><p>&gt; I really like such an approach. So, I tried to generalise some  &gt; principles underlying 5-limit chord progressions. The most thorough  &gt; discussion of these which I could find so far are Schoenberg&apos;s two  &gt; harmony books. Some underlying principles I hope I have found in  &gt; Schoenberg&apos;s explanation of his guidelines for root progressions.  &gt; Therefore, I formalised his explanation, and not his actual rules.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; You mention that you could apply his rules to 31 ET. That&apos;s of could  &gt; right, you can do that (in my former mail I mentioned 12 ET, because  &gt; I reacted to Carl dispraise of music theory approaches restricted to  &gt; 12 ET). However, you can only create 5-limit root progressions that  &gt; way (naturally, you may stagger higher-limit chords on top). My  &gt; generalised guidelines, on the other hand, at least formally also  &gt; work for 7-limit (or any other limit).</p><p>Carl specifically mentioned musical set theory.  I don&apos;t think that objection applies to music theory in general. Although some of S&apos;s ideas led to musical set theory I don&apos;t think he was guilty of that way of thinking.</p><p>&gt; Now, my question is of could do these generalised guidelines also  &gt; result in chord progressions which convince musically? Or did I just  &gt; some formal exercise here?<br/>&gt; &gt; I would greatly appreciate comments in critics in this regard (e.g.,  &gt; by criticising the example progressions I sent in multiple mails  &gt; before).</p><p>I have PDFs but not audio examples.  Are they the optimal voicings?</p><p>&gt; Even more so, I would like to hear alternative guidelines for  &gt; creating chord progression where root relations are beyond 5-limit.</p><p>One of the ideas we had was to follow chords with common tones round the lattice, and arrive at a distinct interval in JI that you temper out.  These are &quot;comma pumps&quot;.  I don&apos;t know if it&apos;s a way to find good progressions but it&apos;s a great way to confuse people who are listening for the roots!</p><p>&gt; I should perhaps mention some guideline related to my generalised  &gt; guidelines: prefer chord progressions which share common tones (a  &gt; harmonic band in Schoenberg&apos;s terminology). The guidelines I detailed  &gt; before are more precise that this harmonic-band-guideline.</p><p>But there&apos;s another view, from Rothenberg, that cadences should include all notes in the scale.  So it&apos;s actually best to avoid common tones where possible.</p><p>&gt;&gt; 2) Resolve by stepwise contrary motion<br/>&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt; I&apos;m sorry, but we may talk at cross-purposes here. Melodic motion is  &gt; of course also important for chord progressions, but is a different  &gt; matter (and you simplify it too :). So far, I was solely talking  &gt; about chord root progressions, only a sub-aspect of harmony in  &gt; general. Of course, there are other important aspects in harmony,  &gt; which I left out for simplicity. For example, there is the treatment  &gt; of dissonances (e.g., what is a dissonance, are they prepared and  &gt; how, are they resolved and how). This matter is related to root  &gt; progressions in the sense that dissonances are often resolved by  &gt; strong harmonic progressions (V7 -&gt; 1). There are also melodic  &gt; considerations concerning the treatment of dissonances (e.g.,  &gt; dissonances are most smoothly resolved by a step downwards), but  &gt; these might be somewhat less crucial than the harmonic progression  &gt; resolving a dissonance (e.g., if V7 is resolved in I but the 7th is  &gt; not directly leading into the 3th of I, we may still feel it is OK).  &gt; Moreover, there is the aspect of how chords are related to a scale  &gt; and how the underlying scale can change (modulation). And there are  &gt; further aspects (e.g., chords can be inserted or left out of a  &gt; progression etc.).</p><p>Margo Schulter gave some medieval examples and stepwise contrary motion was the core idea.  I&apos;ve held that as the unifying rule for harmony in different styles.  Yes, root progressions are different, but the Rules of Harmony grow out of good practice that takes account of melody. Sometimes the rules that make good root progressions are there because they lead to good melody.  Rather than take those rules literally to new systems you should find new rules that lead to good melody.</p><p>&gt; Now, besides all this there is of course also the field of  &gt; counterpoint. I assume you are referring to that.</p><p>Harmony and counterpoint are different ways of looking at the same thing a lot of the time.</p><p>&gt;&gt; The issue of fifths is a tricky one. For a wide range of<br/>&gt;&gt; music, from madrigals to blues, there&apos;s an expectation that<br/>&gt;&gt; chords are related by fifths. Whether it&apos;s natural or not<br/>&gt;&gt; it&apos;s something listeners will expect. But is it possible to<br/>&gt;&gt; establish other relationships that work as well in scales<br/>&gt;&gt; that don&apos;t have long chains of fifths?<br/>&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt; I agree in general and certainly for the blues (see also discussion  &gt; above). I am not so sure about madrigals though, many go beyond that.  &gt; For example, many root progressions in Gesualdo&apos;s work are 5-limit.</p><p>Gesualdo used different cadences in his madrigals but he did prefer V-I.  Some people find his harmony aimless, of course, partly because they hold him to rules that hadn&apos;t been invented.</p><p>An interesting thing about Gesualdo, though, there are some examples where he implies intervals of a diesis, which would have been 1 step of 31-equal (a plausible tuning if he had a 19 note harpsichord).  Easley Blackwood gives some examples.   You could also interpret them as being progressions from equal temperament that don&apos;t work with common tones in meantone.  However, you can mis-spell one of the notes and call that chord a 9-limit triad.  That works because the &quot;bad&quot; thirds in meantone have a 9-limit interpretation.  So, whatever Gesualdo intended, this shows that there&apos;s a family of progressions for which 9-limit harmony is the *solution* to a common tone modulation problem.</p><p>&gt;&gt; Next, there&apos;s the issue of &quot;what is a step&quot;? In miracle<br/>&gt;&gt; temperament (31&amp;41) I tried to follow the decimal scale. I<br/>&gt;&gt; had rules to ensure &quot;steps&quot; were smaller than &quot;leaps&quot; and I<br/>&gt;&gt; avoided smaller intervals that could be heard as<br/>&gt;&gt; &quot;mistunings&quot;.

I understood that this  &gt; notion is common in microtonal music as well. For example, it means  &gt; exactly the same as Doty&apos;s &quot;Primer&quot; denotes with the term  &gt; &quot;identity&quot; (e.g., 5/1 is an identity and a pitch class).

One could spend several<br/>&gt; lifetimes writing music around such progressions. I would<br/>&gt; probably have put the examples at a somewhat lower pitch...<br/>&gt; What is your workflow for producing the notation?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &quot;These ratios automatically derived from the 31 ET pitch<br/>&gt; classes&quot;... using Strasheela, I take it. Wow, very powerful.</p><p>These examples are just meant as a demonstration of ascending chord progressions which are not restricted by a scale and are beyond 7-limit (which is what you asked for :). I like listening to them too, but already pointed out that they do have problems (e.g., no proper voice-leading, the treatment of inversions is perhaps too simplistic, no dissonance treatment -- although I actually don&apos;t feel that the latter is a problem here).</p><p>The notation and sound synthesis was created automatically once I had a solution (just a mouse click..).</p><p>Here is briefly how this works. The Strasheela user defines a music theory model (a musical constraint problem, a combinatorial problem) by specifying a music representation which contains variables (unknowns) and by applying restrictions (constraints) on these variables. Many ready-to-use score object types are already available for the music representation. In this example, I created a plain sequence of chords. The variables in these chords are their type (e.g., the intervallic relations of the untransposed pitch classes and the untransposed root, can be much more), transposition, root, and the transposed pitch classes. I applied harmonic constraints to these variables (e.g., all chord progression are &quot;ascending&quot;, it ends in a cadence etc). The problem is then handed to a constraint solver in order to find one or more solutions. Once we have a solution we can output it into various formats. Here, I used Lilypond for the notation and Csound for the synthesis.</p><p>For generating the output, all the information contained in the music representation is available. The Strasheela user has much control over this output process. For example, you can define in a clause-like manner what Lilypond code is generated for a note and what code for a chord etc. For 31 ET I predefined clauses for chord output, and these were used in the examples you saw. Actually, these clauses are pretty simple. The clause has access to the untransposed pitch classes of the chord objects and their root. So, it outputs the root in staff notation and additionally creates these ratios from the untransposed pitch classes and the root. There exists a mapping from 31 ET pitch classes to ratios. As I pointed out in the readme file, this approach can fail, as tempered pitches are not mapped unambiguously to JI pitches. For example, there are some 11-limit root ratios in the notation, but all intervals between chord roots are 9-limit (because there are only 9-limit chords and all chords share common pitch classes). The 11-limit ratios are the result of the temperament ambiguity...</p><p>&gt; &gt; BTW, Schoenberg<br/>&gt; &gt; certainly did not directly &quot;use&quot; any of his published<br/>&gt; &gt; theoretical works for his own compositions, as these books<br/>&gt; &gt; are meant for teaching and are much more conservative than<br/>&gt; &gt; his compositions.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I thought his works could (roughly) be divided into<br/>&gt; pre- and post- 12-tone technique periods (?).<br/>&gt;<br/>That is the overall tendency. However, there also exist many tonal compositions he wrote late in his life -- besides dodecaphonic. Also, there exist compositions which are neither tonal nor dodecaphonic, or at the borderline between tonal and non-tonal, and these are among the most interesting I feel.</p><p>&gt; &gt; &gt; Here is how I would do it:<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; root -&gt; root<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; CM -&gt; Cmin (2 common tones)<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; root -&gt; tone<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; CM -&gt; Amin (2 common tones)<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; CM -&gt; FM (1 common tone)<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; CM -&gt; Fmin (1 common tone)<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; CM -&gt; AbM (1 common tone)<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; tone -&gt; root<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; CM -&gt; Emin (2 common tones)<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; CM -&gt; EM (1 common tone)<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; CM -&gt; GM (1 common tone)<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; CM -&gt; Gmin (1 common tone)<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; tone -&gt; tone<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; CM -&gt; AM (1 common tone)<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; CM -&gt; C#min (1 common tone)<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; CM -&gt; EbM (1 common tone)<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; I am not sure I follow. I assume you mean by &quot;root -&gt; tone&quot;<br/>&gt; &gt; that the root of the second chord was no chord tone in the<br/>&gt; &gt; previous chord,<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; That the second chord contains the root of the first as a<br/>&gt; non-root tone. It happens that this also means what you say<br/>&gt; here is true.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; and by &quot;tone -&gt; root&quot; that the root of the second chord was<br/>&gt; &gt; some non-root tone of the previous.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Yes.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; But what is then &quot;tone -&gt; tone&quot;? Could you please explain?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Some non-root tone of the first chord is a non-root tone<br/>&gt; in the second. Hopefully the examples will help.<br/>&gt;</p><p>If two chords have a different root but common pitches, then their are only two cases possible. Either the root of the new chord did exists (as non-root) in the previous chord (descending), or it did not (ascending or strong progression). All your &quot;tone -&gt; tone&quot; chords can be sorted into these two categories, just try it out :)</p><p>&gt; &gt; Just as an illustration, I resort your chords according to<br/>&gt; &gt; the category formalisation I discussed in my first mail<br/>&gt; //<br/>&gt; &gt; constant root &quot;progression&quot;<br/>&gt; &gt; CM -&gt; Cmin (2 common tones)<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; ascending progressions (strong)<br/>&gt; &gt; CM -&gt; Amin (2 common tones)<br/>&gt; &gt; CM -&gt; FM (1 common tone)<br/>&gt; &gt; CM -&gt; Fmin (1 common tone)<br/>&gt; &gt; CM -&gt; AbM (1 common tone)<br/>&gt; &gt; CM -&gt; AM (1 common tone)<br/>&gt; &gt; CM -&gt; C#min (1 common tone) [is superstrong after Schoenberg]<br/>&gt; &gt; CM -&gt; EbM (1 common tone) [is descending after Schoenberg]<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; descending progressions<br/>&gt; &gt; CM -&gt; Emin (2 common tones)<br/>&gt; &gt; CM -&gt; EM (1 common tone)<br/>&gt; &gt; CM -&gt; GM (1 common tone)<br/>&gt; &gt; CM -&gt; Gmin (1 common tone)<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Yes. The classification I gave is directional; your<br/>&gt; implementation of Schoenberg&apos;s is not.<br/>&gt;<br/>Perhaps I misunderstand you here. However, Schoenberg&apos;s chord progression categories are directional. If you reverse an ascending progression it becomes descending and vice versa.</p><p>&gt; This means that<br/>&gt; whereas I have distinguished between root-&gt;tone and<br/>&gt; tone-&gt;root, S. considers them together. So it seems the<br/>&gt; simplest definitions for S.&apos;s terms are:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; ascending progression - two chords having at least one<br/>&gt; common tone which is a root in one of the chords<br/>&gt;<br/>Two chords have at least one common tone, but the root of the second is new.</p><p>&gt; descending progression - two chords having at least<br/>&gt; one common tone which are not roots of either chord.<br/>&gt;</p><p>&gt; Listening to the examples, I don&apos;t hear evidence that the<br/>&gt; direction matters, but I thought I should expose it to<br/>&gt; test this.<br/>&gt;<br/>Try playing either II V I or I V II ..</p><p>&gt; &gt; &gt; Now: how would we rate these progressions using our ears?<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; I would be interested in your opinion, but already it is<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; obvious that this theory cannot distinguish CM -&gt; EM from<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; CM -&gt; GM, so it is missing something.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; I see what you mean. Shall we complement the formalisation<br/>&gt; &gt; by some harmonic distance, e.g., distance of the chords on<br/>&gt; &gt; the lattice? (e.g., sum of Tenney harmonic distance of all<br/>&gt; &gt; chord tones divided by the tone number??). EMaj is more<br/>&gt; &gt; remote on the lattice from CMaj than GMaj is.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Yes, this would be one sensible approach.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; In fact I would suggest that the strength of the perceived<br/>&gt; change between two chords is the sum of the Tenney-weighted<br/>&gt; harmonic distances between pairs of changing tones in the<br/>&gt; ensemble, arranged so that this sum is minimal. Let me<br/>&gt; explain...<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; The &quot;ensemble&quot; is the set of pitches needed to perform<br/>&gt; both chords.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &quot;changing pitches&quot;: every pitch in the ensemble not<br/>&gt; occurring in both chords.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; For a pair of changing pitches, the Tenney-weighted<br/>&gt; harmonic distance between them is<br/>&gt; log2(TenneyHeight(pitchA - pitchB))<br/>&gt; where<br/>&gt; pitchA &gt;= pitchB<br/>&gt; and<br/>&gt; TenneyHeight(p/q) = p*q<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; For temperaments, we mean the approximations to pitchA<br/>&gt; and pitchB in just intonation.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; So in the example CM -&gt; Cmin, the changing pitches are<br/>&gt; E &lt;-&gt; Eb, which are approximately 5/4 &lt;-&gt; 6/5 in just<br/>&gt; intonation. 5/4 - 6/5 = 25/24, and log2(600) = 9.23.<br/>&gt; Compare this to CM -&gt; Amin, where log2(10*9) = 6.49.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; If there is only 1 changing pitch in the enemble (for<br/>&gt; example C-E-G-Bb -&gt; C-E-G, where the changing pitch<br/>&gt; is Bb), then the &quot;perceived change strength&quot; between<br/>&gt; the chords shall be zero.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; If there are more than 2 changing pitches, we find the<br/>&gt; pairing for which the sum of the harmonic distances is<br/>&gt; minimal. This includes the ability to exclude the most<br/>&gt; distant pitch in case there are an odd number of pitches.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Back in the original example (CM-&gt;GM vs. CM-&gt;EM), we<br/>&gt; have<br/>&gt; C&lt;-&gt;D + E&lt;-&gt;B = 8.75 for CM-&gt;GM<br/>&gt; and<br/>&gt; G&lt;-&gt;B + C&lt;-&gt;G# = 12.97 for CM-&gt;EM<br/>&gt; So perhaps it&apos;s working. We should calculate values for<br/>&gt; all of the progressions in my table and see if they make<br/>&gt; sense.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; This method should be completely general for higher limits,<br/>&gt; and would even claim to measure the strength of progressions<br/>&gt; between chords of different sizes (tetrads, triads, etc.)<br/>&gt; on the same scale.<br/>&gt;</p><p>Thank you very much for this lecture, I really like it :)</p><p>I am not quite convinced yet by (or I don&apos;t understand) your proposal how you access the pair(s) of pitches used for computing the &quot;change strength&quot;. For example, I feel G79 -&gt; G should also result into 0, even if there are 2 changing pitches. Also, using only the pair with the minimal value results in equal values for the following two chord progressions: CM-&gt;Amin vs CM -&gt; F#min. If I am not mistaken, the interval with minimal harmonic distance in both cases is G-A (9/10). Perhaps we better consider some mean (arithmetic mean?) of all pairs of changing pitches? The exception would be chord progressions which simply add or remove pitches (i.e. one set of pitches is a subset of the other). Those should be 0, as you suggested already.</p><p>Best<br/>Torsten</p><p>--<br/>Torsten Anders<br/>Interdisciplinary Centre for Computer Music Research<br/>University of Plymouth<br/>Office: +44-1752-233667<br/>Private: +44-1752-558917<br/><a href="http://strasheela.sourceforge.net">http://strasheela.sourceforge.net</a><br/><a href="http://www.torsten-anders.de">http://www.torsten-anders.de</a></p></div><h3><a id=76026 href="#76026">ðŸ”—</a>Torsten Anders &#x3C;torstenanders@gmx.de&#x3E;</h3><span>4/24/2008 2:49:43 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Dear Graham and Carl,</p><p>On Apr 24, 2008, at 4:58 PM, Carl Lumma wrote:<br/>&gt; Graham wrote...<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; But there&apos;s another view, from Rothenberg, that cadences<br/>&gt; &gt; should include all notes in the scale.

I take it you mean temperament here. However, you can do that in other temperaments too like 12 ET or meantone. Or am I missing something here?</p><p>&gt; &gt; Yet, 19th century harmony is of course restricted to 5-limit -- its<br/>&gt; &gt; root progressions certainly are. Meanwhile, we realised that 7-limit<br/>&gt; &gt; and beyond can be fruitful to for harmony. So, my question is how &gt; can<br/>&gt; &gt; we create convincing chord progressions beyond 5-limit? Can we find<br/>&gt; &gt; some guidelines which simplify the composition process, much like &gt; the<br/>&gt; &gt; guidelines of 5-limit harmony did for former centuries.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; 9-limit chords are interesting. You get a 6:7:9 subminor<br/>&gt; triad with a bluesey feel that seems to work well enough as<br/>&gt; well as its opposite, the car horn supermajor triad.<br/>&gt; Because they&apos;re still traids they have clear roots and<br/>&gt; follow voice leading rules. 7 odd-limit triads (other than<br/>&gt; the 5-limit) don&apos;t fit so well.<br/>&gt;</p><p>I love the 6:7:9 subminor triad :) Supermajor needs getting used to though.. I assume they have a clear root because they have a fifths (Hindemith&apos;s explanation). We can have 7-limit tetrads with clear root too.</p><p>However, I actually meant chord progressions where the intervals between chord roots (or alternatively their fundamentals, their relative 1/1) are beyond 7-limit. A comparative 5-limit example are mediant chords: in C-major going to Ab-maj, Eb-maj and similar progressions. I am looking for guidelines to creating convincing 7-limit root progressions.</p><p>I proposed some and showed some examples, but I feel this can be improved...</p><p>&gt; &gt; Now, my question is of could do these generalised guidelines also<br/>&gt; &gt; result in chord progressions which convince musically? Or did I just<br/>&gt; &gt; some formal exercise here?<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; I would greatly appreciate comments in critics in this regard (e.g.,<br/>&gt; &gt; by criticising the example progressions I sent in multiple mails<br/>&gt; &gt; before).<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I have PDFs but not audio examples. Are they the optimal<br/>&gt; voicings?<br/>&gt;<br/>The audio examples are available just next to the PDF files. And I agree (as discussed before), they are not optimal voicings. Perhaps for demonstrations like this I better bring all chords in root position, as I did in the first examples I posted.</p><p>&gt; &gt; I should perhaps mention some guideline related to my generalised<br/>&gt; &gt; guidelines: prefer chord progressions which share common tones (a<br/>&gt; &gt; harmonic band in Schoenberg&apos;s terminology). The guidelines I &gt; detailed<br/>&gt; &gt; before are more precise that this harmonic-band-guideline.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; But there&apos;s another view, from Rothenberg, that cadences<br/>&gt; should include all notes in the scale. So it&apos;s actually<br/>&gt; best to avoid common tones where possible.<br/>&gt;<br/>It turns out, these two guidelines work well together: all my examples I posted in this thread (including the diatonic progressions in the beginning) end in a cadence defined exactly like that: bring all tones of the scale. Still, these chord progressions are ascending (e.g. share common pitches but bring a new root pitch), and these are the most common cadences, e.g., II V I.</p><p>BTW: what is the reference for Rothenberg paper/book you are referring to?</p><p>&gt; &gt;&gt; 2) Resolve by stepwise contrary motion<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; I&apos;m sorry, but we may talk at cross-purposes here. Melodic motion is<br/>&gt; &gt; of course also important for chord progressions, but is a different<br/>&gt; &gt; matter (and you simplify it too :). So far, I was solely talking<br/>&gt; &gt; about chord root progressions, only a sub-aspect of harmony in<br/>&gt; &gt; general. Of course, there are other important aspects in harmony,<br/>&gt; &gt; which I left out for simplicity. For example, there is the treatment<br/>&gt; &gt; of dissonances (e.g., what is a dissonance, are they prepared and<br/>&gt; &gt; how, are they resolved and how). This matter is related to root<br/>&gt; &gt; progressions in the sense that dissonances are often resolved by<br/>&gt; &gt; strong harmonic progressions (V7 -&gt; 1). There are also melodic<br/>&gt; &gt; considerations concerning the treatment of dissonances (e.g.,<br/>&gt; &gt; dissonances are most smoothly resolved by a step downwards), but<br/>&gt; &gt; these might be somewhat less crucial than the harmonic progression<br/>&gt; &gt; resolving a dissonance (e.g., if V7 is resolved in I but the 7th is<br/>&gt; &gt; not directly leading into the 3th of I, we may still feel it is OK).<br/>&gt; &gt; Moreover, there is the aspect of how chords are related to a scale<br/>&gt; &gt; and how the underlying scale can change (modulation). And there are<br/>&gt; &gt; further aspects (e.g., chords can be inserted or left out of a<br/>&gt; &gt; progression etc.).<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Margo Schulter gave some medieval examples and stepwise<br/>&gt; contrary motion was the core idea. I&apos;ve held that as the<br/>&gt; unifying rule for harmony in different styles. Yes, root<br/>&gt; progressions are different, but the Rules of Harmony grow<br/>&gt; out of good practice that takes account of melody.<br/>&gt; Sometimes the rules that make good root progressions are<br/>&gt; there because they lead to good melody. Rather than take<br/>&gt; those rules literally to new systems you should find new<br/>&gt; rules that lead to good melody.<br/>&gt;</p><p>I feel you over-simplify a bit here. By referring to medieval examples you made it rather specific that you are talking about counterpoint (that is, the family of medieval &quot;counterpoints&quot;, as there are multiple medieval contrapuntal styles with different rule sets). As you certainly know, harmony is a much younger idea, not arriving before early Baroque. Certainly, some aspects of pre-Baroque counterpoint already contain harmonic considerations, in particular the cadences. Also, in Josquin music I found that ascending &quot;chord&quot; progressions are more likely than descending progressions.</p><p>Nevertheless, I feel it is a good idea to look at each aspect carefully in his own right. Yes, there are some chord progressions which are closely couples with melodic progressions. The Neapolitanian sixth chord is a good example. Still, it is somewhat simplifying to quasi say &quot;focus on writing good melody, that will lead to good harmony&quot; :) Actually, in much Western music there is a tendency the other way round, take Blues, cadentical 18-century music or 19th century music like Wagner.</p><p>&gt; Harmony and counterpoint are different ways of looking at<br/>&gt; the same thing a lot of the time.<br/>&gt;<br/>:) Certainly, harmony and counterpoint influence each other. However, they are precisely looking at the same thing from different points of view. Consequently, we can end up with rather different results depending on whether counterpoint or harmony played a more important role -- as can be seen throughout Western music history. But this kind of discussion is perhaps leading nowhere, because we are not specific here :)</p><p>&gt; &gt;&gt; The issue of fifths is a tricky one. For a wide range of<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt; music, from madrigals to blues, there&apos;s an expectation that<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt; chords are related by fifths. Whether it&apos;s natural or not<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt; it&apos;s something listeners will expect. But is it possible to<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt; establish other relationships that work as well in scales<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt; that don&apos;t have long chains of fifths?<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; I agree in general and certainly for the blues (see also discussion<br/>&gt; &gt; above). I am not so sure about madrigals though, many go beyond &gt; that.<br/>&gt; &gt; For example, many root progressions in Gesualdo&apos;s work are 5-limit.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Gesualdo used different cadences in his madrigals but he did<br/>&gt; prefer V-I. Some people find his harmony aimless, of<br/>&gt; course, partly because they hold him to rules that hadn&apos;t<br/>&gt; been invented.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; An interesting thing about Gesualdo, though, there are some<br/>&gt; examples where he implies intervals of a diesis, which would<br/>&gt; have been 1 step of 31-equal (a plausible tuning if he had a<br/>&gt; 19 note harpsichord). Easley Blackwood gives some examples.<br/>&gt; You could also interpret them as being progressions from<br/>&gt; equal temperament that don&apos;t work with common tones in<br/>&gt; meantone. However, you can mis-spell one of the notes and<br/>&gt; call that chord a 9-limit triad. That works because the<br/>&gt; &quot;bad&quot; thirds in meantone have a 9-limit interpretation. So,<br/>&gt; whatever Gesualdo intended, this shows that there&apos;s a family<br/>&gt; of progressions for which 9-limit harmony is the *solution*<br/>&gt; to a common tone modulation problem.<br/>&gt;<br/>Thanks for pointing this out! Could you perhaps give a reference of the Blackwood text, or provide the chord progression so that I can follow you better. What 9-limit chords do you find in Gesualdo, 6:7:9 ??</p><p>Also, I don&apos;t quite understand what you mean by &quot;a family<br/>of progressions for which 9-limit harmony is the *solution*<br/>to a common tone modulation problem.&quot;</p><p>&gt; &gt;&gt; Next, there&apos;s the issue of &quot;what is a step&quot;? In miracle<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt; temperament (31&amp;41) I tried to follow the decimal scale. I<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt; had rules to ensure &quot;steps&quot; were smaller than &quot;leaps&quot; and I<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt; avoided smaller intervals that could be heard as<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt; &quot;mistunings&quot;. This lead to decimal counterpoint, for which<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt; I&apos;ve tracked down the examples now:<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt; <a href="http://x31eq.com/music/counterpoint.html">http://x31eq.com/music/counterpoint.html</a><br/>&gt; &gt;&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt; I still haven&apos;t explained the theory but it&apos;s a<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt; generalization of Palestrina counterpoint as explained by<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt; Jeppesen and Fux. I think it makes sense but it&apos;s still<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt; counterpoint rather than harmony. There is a tendency for<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt; chords or modulations to be related by secors (the large<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt; semitones) because they&apos;re the generators of the scales.<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; I would like to read the theory behind these.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; You need to be familiar with decimal notation:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; <a href="http://x31eq.com/decimal_notation.htm">http://x31eq.com/decimal_notation.htm</a><br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I have a table of intervals as follows:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; C1 | 0* 6* 3^+<br/>&gt; C2 | 4^ 3^ 3v 7 8^* 2^* 7^^*<br/>&gt; C3 | 4^+ 3v+ 7+ 2^ 5* 5^ 2 2v+ 9v 5v+ 9+<br/>&gt; D1 | 2+ 5^+ 2v 1^^* 4v* 6^^* 8* 8^^* 9v+ 2vv+ 3 5v 9 7v<br/>&gt; D2 | 1^ 2vv 3+ 3^^* 7v+ 7^* 8^^^* 4+ 9^ 5^^*<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; The meaning is<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; C/Dn -- level of consonance/dissonance<br/>&gt; Digit -- number of secors (16:15 or 15:14)<br/>&gt; ^ -- raise by a quomma (between 10 secors and an octave)<br/>&gt; v -- lower by a secor<br/>&gt; * -- or equivalent in any octave<br/>&gt; + -- only equivalents greater than an octave<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; The idea is that you shouldn&apos;t jump directly from C1 to a<br/>&gt; dissonance. When you&apos;re in C1 then C3 intervals have to be<br/>&gt; treated as dissonances. Generally with two parts C3 counts<br/>&gt; as mild dissonance. D2 intervals aren&apos;t used much.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I also have an alteration moving 2 from C3 do D1 because I<br/>&gt; changed my mind at some point.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; The simplest melodic rule to explain is that you have a<br/>&gt; mohajira scale in the decimal nominals:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; 1 1 2 1 2 1 2<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Each note has two or three alternative spellings differing<br/>&gt; by a quomma. The simplest way of thinking about that is<br/>&gt; that the whole piece has to be playable within one blackjack<br/>&gt; scale. You also have to be careful that the 1 1 interval is<br/>&gt; heard as two steps whereas a 2 interval is a single step.<br/>&gt; So if you ever leap over the 1 1 you have to immediately<br/>&gt; fill it in.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Given all that you can generalize your favourite rules of<br/>&gt; counterpoint in the obvious way.<br/>&gt;<br/>Thanks for these details. Slowly changing the degree of dissonance makes perfectly sense to me. I don&apos;t understand your scale example though: if these are nominals, does the scale consist of only two different and repeated pitches? I don&apos;t understand why 1 1 is an interval larger than unison and heard as two steps.</p><p>&gt; &gt;&gt; Pitch class sets<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt; are a more modern concept that I don&apos;t see the need to bring in.<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; I am using the pitch class notion in a generalised sense: a pitch<br/>&gt; &gt; where the octave component is neglected. I understood that this<br/>&gt; &gt; notion is common in microtonal music as well. For example, it means<br/>&gt; &gt; exactly the same as Doty&apos;s &quot;Primer&quot; denotes with the term<br/>&gt; &gt; &quot;identity&quot; (e.g., 5/1 is an identity and a pitch class). Using the<br/>&gt; &gt; notion of sets to refer to multiple pitch classes (identities) &gt; allows<br/>&gt; &gt; then to speak precisely about relations of multiple chords etc. and<br/>&gt; &gt; formalise such relations. Would you suggest an alternative concept<br/>&gt; &gt; instead for this purpose?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I&apos;d rather pitch classes included a sense of tuning<br/>&gt; imprecision but I&apos;m fighting a losing battle on that one.<br/>&gt;<br/>Oh, I have no problem with that idea. I agree that we can tune the identity/pitchclass 5/1 in various ways and still recognise it as third over 1/1.</p><p>Best<br/>Torsten</p><p>--<br/>Torsten Anders<br/>Interdisciplinary Centre for Computer Music Research<br/>University of Plymouth<br/>Office: +44-1752-233667<br/>Private: +44-1752-558917<br/><a href="http://strasheela.sourceforge.net">http://strasheela.sourceforge.net</a><br/><a href="http://www.torsten-anders.de">http://www.torsten-anders.de</a></p></div><h3><a id=76028 href="#76028">ðŸ”—</a>Carl Lumma &#x3C;carl@lumma.org&#x3E;</h3><span>4/24/2008 4:23:23 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Hi Torsten,</p><p>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Here is how I would do it:<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; root -&gt; root<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; CM -&gt; Cmin (2 common tones)<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; root -&gt; tone<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; CM -&gt; Amin (2 common tones)<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; CM -&gt; FM (1 common tone)<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; CM -&gt; Fmin (1 common tone)<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; CM -&gt; AbM (1 common tone)<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; tone -&gt; root<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; CM -&gt; Emin (2 common tones)<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; CM -&gt; EM (1 common tone)<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; CM -&gt; GM (1 common tone)<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; CM -&gt; Gmin (1 common tone)<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; tone -&gt; tone<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; CM -&gt; AM (1 common tone)<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; CM -&gt; C#min (1 common tone)<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; CM -&gt; EbM (1 common tone)<br/>//<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; Just as an illustration, I resort your chords according to<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; the category formalisation I discussed in my first mail<br/>&gt; &gt; //<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; constant root &quot;progression&quot;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; CM -&gt; Cmin (2 common tones)<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; ascending progressions (strong)<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; CM -&gt; Amin (2 common tones)<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; CM -&gt; FM (1 common tone)<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; CM -&gt; Fmin (1 common tone)<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; CM -&gt; AbM (1 common tone)<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; CM -&gt; AM (1 common tone)<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; CM -&gt; C#min (1 common tone) [is superstrong after Schoenberg]<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; CM -&gt; EbM (1 common tone) [is descending after Schoenberg]<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; descending progressions<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; CM -&gt; Emin (2 common tones)<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; CM -&gt; EM (1 common tone)<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; CM -&gt; GM (1 common tone)<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; CM -&gt; Gmin (1 common tone)<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; Yes. The classification I gave is directional; your<br/>&gt; &gt; implementation of Schoenberg&apos;s is not.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; Perhaps I misunderstand you here. However, Schoenberg&apos;s chord<br/>&gt; progression categories are directional. If you reverse an<br/>&gt; ascending progression it becomes descending and vice versa.</p><p>I meant, the difference between the two lists above<br/>is only that my root-&gt;tone and tone-&gt;root groups were<br/>merged into &quot;ascending&quot;.  My other groups are like-&gt;like,<br/>so they can&apos;t be directional with respect to the type of<br/>the common tone(s).</p><p>&gt; &gt; Listening to the examples, I don&apos;t hear evidence that the<br/>&gt; &gt; direction matters, but I thought I should expose it to<br/>&gt; &gt; test this.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Try playing either II V I or I V II ..</p><p>That&apos;s a 3-chord progression.  I V and V I sound the same.</p><p>&gt; &gt; In fact I would suggest that the strength of the perceived<br/>&gt; &gt; change between two chords is the sum of the Tenney-weighted<br/>&gt; &gt; harmonic distances between pairs of changing tones in the<br/>&gt; &gt; ensemble, arranged so that this sum is minimal. Let me<br/>&gt; &gt; explain...<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; The &quot;ensemble&quot; is the set of pitches needed to perform<br/>&gt; &gt; both chords.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &quot;changing pitches&quot;: every pitch in the ensemble not<br/>&gt; &gt; occurring in both chords.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; For a pair of changing pitches, the Tenney-weighted<br/>&gt; &gt; harmonic distance between them is<br/>&gt; &gt; log2(TenneyHeight(pitchA - pitchB))<br/>&gt; &gt; where<br/>&gt; &gt; pitchA &gt;= pitchB<br/>&gt; &gt; and<br/>&gt; &gt; TenneyHeight(p/q) = p*q<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; For temperaments, we mean the approximations to pitchA<br/>&gt; &gt; and pitchB in just intonation.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; So in the example CM -&gt; Cmin, the changing pitches are<br/>&gt; &gt; E &lt;-&gt; Eb, which are approximately 5/4 &lt;-&gt; 6/5 in just<br/>&gt; &gt; intonation. 5/4 - 6/5 = 25/24, and log2(600) = 9.23.<br/>&gt; &gt; Compare this to CM -&gt; Amin, where log2(10*9) = 6.49.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; If there is only 1 changing pitch in the enemble (for<br/>&gt; &gt; example C-E-G-Bb -&gt; C-E-G, where the changing pitch<br/>&gt; &gt; is Bb), then the &quot;perceived change strength&quot; between<br/>&gt; &gt; the chords shall be zero.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; If there are more than 2 changing pitches, we find the<br/>&gt; &gt; pairing for which the sum of the harmonic distances is<br/>&gt; &gt; minimal. This includes the ability to exclude the most<br/>&gt; &gt; distant pitch in case there are an odd number of pitches.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; Back in the original example (CM-&gt;GM vs. CM-&gt;EM), we<br/>&gt; &gt; have<br/>&gt; &gt; C&lt;-&gt;D + E&lt;-&gt;B = 8.75 for CM-&gt;GM<br/>&gt; &gt; and<br/>&gt; &gt; G&lt;-&gt;B + C&lt;-&gt;G# = 12.97 for CM-&gt;EM<br/>&gt; &gt; So perhaps it&apos;s working. We should calculate values for<br/>&gt; &gt; all of the progressions in my table and see if they make<br/>&gt; &gt; sense.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; This method should be completely general for higher limits,<br/>&gt; &gt; and would even claim to measure the strength of progressions<br/>&gt; &gt; between chords of different sizes (tetrads, triads, etc.)<br/>&gt; &gt; on the same scale.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Thank you very much for this lecture, I really like it :)<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I am not quite convinced yet by (or I don&apos;t understand) your<br/>&gt; proposal how you access the pair(s) of pitches used for<br/>&gt; computing the &quot;change strength&quot;. For example, I feel<br/>&gt; G79 -&gt; G should also result into 0, even if there are<br/>&gt; 2 changing pitches.</p><p>You&apos;re right -- pooling all the changing pitches together<br/>isn&apos;t enough.  One must keep track of them according to the<br/>chord they came from, making sure to take one from each<br/>pool for every pair.  So it your example, Bb and D would be<br/>cast out and the &quot;change strength&quot; would be zero.</p><p>&gt; Also, using only the pair with the minimal value results<br/>&gt; in equal values for the following two chord progressions:<br/>&gt; CM-&gt;Amin vs CM -&gt; F#min. If I am not mistaken, the<br/>&gt; interval with minimal harmonic distance in both cases is<br/>&gt; G-A (9/10).</p><p>So CM-&gt;Amin is log2(9*10) = 6.49 (as above).  CM-&gt;F#min<br/>has no common tones, so the sum of pairs of changing tones<br/>will surely be &gt; 7.  You&apos;ll have to tell me the ratio of<br/>F# to C and then I can calculate it exactly.</p><p>&gt; Perhaps we better consider some mean (arithmetic<br/>&gt; mean?) of all pairs of changing pitches?</p><p>I don&apos;t think this would add information.  Instead, it would<br/>put triads, tetrads, etc. each on their own scale.  Doing<br/>it my way, we can compare chords of different sizes directly.<br/>In other words, the strength of triad-&gt;triad could be<br/>directly compared to the strength of tetrad-&gt;tetrad.</p><p>-Carl</p></div><h3><a id=76029 href="#76029">ðŸ”—</a>Torsten Anders &#x3C;torstenanders@gmx.de&#x3E;</h3><span>4/24/2008 4:28:35 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Dear Hans Straub,</p><p>thanks for pointing me to this explanation.</p><p>I may come back later to you with more questions concerning MaMuTh.

For<br/>instance, why is the German sixth and its resolution so utterly beautiful?<br/>The power of the authentic cadence could be explained mathematically simply<br/>by observing that the root moves up in a 3:4 ratio. The German sixth<br/>resolves to major by a root movement of 4:5. And resolution of a German<br/>sixth to minor is strikingly simple from a mathmatical standpoint in that<br/>the real fundamental pitch class doesn&apos;t even move. Does Shoenberg attempt<br/>to explain mathematically why certain musical progressions make more sense<br/>to the western ear and others don&apos;t? Such a work I&apos;d like to see.</p><p>&lt;&lt;&lt; For a wide range of music, from madrigals to blues, there&apos;s an<br/>expectation that chords are related by fifths. Whether it&apos;s natural or not<br/>it&apos;s something listeners will expect. &gt;&gt;&gt;</p><p>The circle of fifths do convey a strong sense of a musical statement.<br/>Non-cadencing non-tertian harmonies of the 20th century sound diluted to me<br/>because of the lack of that powerful tension and resolution. It&apos;s like<br/>hearing a language you&apos;ve never learned and you can&apos;t hear the<br/>subject-predicate relationship.</p><p>&lt;&lt;&lt; Sure, decending fifths are the most important root progression in many<br/>musical styles. For example, in Jazz you can have astonishingly complex<br/>chord progressions which are all understood as II V I progressions. &gt;&gt;&gt;</p><p>And some of these can be found disguised. Using the &quot;altered&quot; jazz chord,<br/>which merely puts a new root a tritone under a chord to create a new one,<br/>you hear a bass going down by half-steps in what is in essence a<br/>circle-of-fifths progression.</p><p>&lt;&lt;&lt; We can directly apply the idea to microtonal harmony where we could have<br/>root progressions only along the 3-dimension of the lattice and then stagger<br/>various chords on top of these roots. Of course, we cannot have only<br/>descending fifths in JI (we would never get &quot;back&quot;), but we can write music<br/>where most root progressions are of this kind. &gt;&gt;&gt;</p><p>When applying songs that have a strong circle of 5ths progression to JI<br/>interpretations, such as &quot;Five Foot Two&quot;, use of Pythagorean tunings for<br/>chord roots lets you use just fifths to &quot;take you home&quot;. If you use 5-limit<br/>tunings for 3 or 6 chords, you will need at least one wolf 5th on the return<br/>trip. Maybe a person with a well-tuned ear will sense if the III chord will<br/>be going the circle-of-5ths route to tonic, and sharp it to a Pythagorean<br/>3rd unconsciously, knowing that this is in fact a V/V/V/V chord.</p><p>&lt;&lt;&lt; Yet, 19th century harmony is of course restricted to 5-limit -- its root<br/>progressions certainly are. Meanwhile, we realised that 7-limit and beyond<br/>can be fruitful to for harmony. So, my question is how can we create<br/>convincing chord progressions beyond 5-limit? Can we find some guidelines<br/>which simplify the composition process, much like the guidelines of 5-limit<br/>harmony did for former centuries. &gt;&gt;&gt;</p><p>I but wonder if some of the blues-style harmonies may be an example of this.<br/>For instance, Mood Indigo has ended in a dominant 7th chord that doesn&apos;t<br/>need to be resolved.</p><p>&lt;&lt;&lt; I really like such an approach. So, I tried to generalise some<br/>principles underlying 5-limit chord progressions. The most thorough<br/>discussion of these which I could find so far are Schoenberg&apos;s two harmony<br/>books. Some underlying principles I hope I have found in Schoenberg&apos;s<br/>explanation of his guidelines for root progressions. Therefore, I formalised<br/>his explanation, and not his actual rules. &gt;&gt;&gt;</p><p>What is the names of his two harmony books. Surely those aren&apos;t the two I<br/>read are they? It was so long.</p><p>&lt;&lt;&lt; Even more so, I would like to hear alternative guidelines for creating<br/>chord progression where root relations are beyond 5-limit. &gt;&gt;&gt;</p><p>I see examples of this in vocal music that features a pedaltone in one of<br/>the parts, such as a barbershop tag. For instance, if one part is holding<br/>the tonic note while the chord moves from a tonic to a II7, the root will<br/>need to move up a Septimal-Major second (8/7) to keep the chords tuned<br/>without having to bend the pedaltone.</p><p>Billy</p></div><h3><a id=76036 href="#76036">ðŸ”—</a>Graham Breed &#x3C;gbreed@gmail.com&#x3E;</h3><span>4/24/2008 6:56:05 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Torsten Anders wrote:<br/>&gt; Dear Graham,<br/>&gt; &gt; On Apr 24, 2008, at 2:46 PM, Graham Breed wrote:<br/>&gt;&gt; Torsten Anders wrote:<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt; It would be interesting to explore how we can create convincing  &gt;&gt; chord<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt; progressions where the roots are not all &quot;stringed&quot; on the 3-<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt; dimension of the lattice. 19th century harmony did this a lot, and<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt; this is also a domain explored in Schoenberg&apos;s harmony (his<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt; guidelines are not restricted to fifths progressions).<br/>&gt;&gt; The simplest thing in magic is to go up in thirds and then<br/>&gt;&gt; down a fifth.<br/>&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt; ?? I take it you mean temperament here. However, you can do that in  &gt; other temperaments too like 12 ET or meantone. Or am I missing  &gt; something here?</p><p>I mean magic temperament, consistent with 19, 22, or 41 ET, where the generator is a 5:4 and five  5:4s give one 3:2 (octave equivalently speaking).  So after going up fifth thirds you naturally find yourself a fifth above where you started.  In meantone if you follow 5 major thirds you&apos;ll fall of the end of the keyboard.  In 12ET you&apos;ll end up a third below where you started.</p><p>&gt; I love the 6:7:9 subminor triad :) Supermajor needs getting used to  &gt; though.. I assume they have a clear root because they have a fifths  &gt; (Hindemith&apos;s explanation). We can have 7-limit tetrads with clear  &gt; root too.</p><p>The best rule I know is that the fifth points to the root. That&apos;s following this argument:</p><p><a href="http://www.mmk.e-technik.tu-muenchen.de/persons/ter/top/basse.html">http://www.mmk.e-technik.tu-muenchen.de/persons/ter/top/basse.html</a></p><p>It leaves a lot of chords without a clear root and I prefer to keep them ambiguous than to give them an arbitrary root.   Hence augmented triads seem to be important in magic so they&apos;re likely to be used in cadences.  But how you choose the root progression is arbitrary.  The same applies to diminished seventh chords in 12-equal.</p><p>&gt; However, I actually meant chord progressions where the intervals  &gt; between chord roots (or alternatively their fundamentals, their  &gt; relative 1/1) are beyond 7-limit. A comparative 5-limit example are  &gt; mediant chords: in C-major going to Ab-maj, Eb-maj and similar  &gt; progressions. I am looking for guidelines to creating convincing 7- &gt; limit root progressions.</p><p>That&apos;s where it&apos;s useful to start with scales or tunes that naturally include 7-limit intervals.  Make the harmony serve the melody.</p><p>&gt; I proposed some and showed some examples, but I feel this can be  &gt; improved...<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; Now, my question is of could do these generalised guidelines also<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt; result in chord progressions which convince musically? Or did I just<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt; some formal exercise here?<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt; I would greatly appreciate comments in critics in this regard (e.g.,<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt; by criticising the example progressions I sent in multiple mails<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt; before).<br/>&gt;&gt; I have PDFs but not audio examples. Are they the optimal<br/>&gt;&gt; voicings?<br/>&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt; The audio examples are available just next to the PDF files. And I  &gt; agree (as discussed before), they are not optimal voicings. Perhaps  &gt; for demonstrations like this I better bring all chords in root  &gt; position, as I did in the first examples I posted.</p><p>Oh, in the Files section!  They&apos;re good enough to make music with, I&apos;m sure.  But they&apos;re quite long and I don&apos;t get a sense of returning home at the end.  Maybe there should be shorter excursions from the tonic at the start.</p><p>I like the idea of your software.  Choose some rules, generate some music, and see if it makes sense.  That saves having to write a lot of music without knowing what rules to follow and helps us to bootstrap a microtonal tradition. I&apos;m more interested in optimizing a loss function than obeying constraints, though.  Perhaps one day I&apos;ll be hubristic enough to write my own software to do that.</p><p>&gt;&gt;&gt; I should perhaps mention some guideline related to my generalised<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt; guidelines: prefer chord progressions which share common tones (a<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt; harmonic band in Schoenberg&apos;s terminology). The guidelines I  &gt;&gt; detailed<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt; before are more precise that this harmonic-band-guideline.<br/>&gt;&gt; But there&apos;s another view, from Rothenberg, that cadences<br/>&gt;&gt; should include all notes in the scale. So it&apos;s actually<br/>&gt;&gt; best to avoid common tones where possible.<br/>&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt; It turns out, these two guidelines work well together: all my  &gt; examples I posted in this thread (including the diatonic progressions  &gt; in the beginning) end in a cadence defined exactly like that: bring  &gt; all tones of the scale. Still, these chord progressions are ascending  &gt; (e.g. share common pitches but bring a new root pitch), and these are  &gt; the most common cadences, e.g., II V I.<br/>&gt; &gt; BTW: what is the reference for Rothenberg paper/book you are  &gt; referring to?</p><p>Carl&apos;s given the URL for his web copy.  And he&apos;s right that I had Rothenberg wrong.  He said you need to include the notes that uniquely identify the scale, not all notes.</p><p>&gt;&gt; Margo Schulter gave some medieval examples and stepwise<br/>&gt;&gt; contrary motion was the core idea. I&apos;ve held that as the<br/>&gt;&gt; unifying rule for harmony in different styles. Yes, root<br/>&gt;&gt; progressions are different, but the Rules of Harmony grow<br/>&gt;&gt; out of good practice that takes account of melody.<br/>&gt;&gt; Sometimes the rules that make good root progressions are<br/>&gt;&gt; there because they lead to good melody. Rather than take<br/>&gt;&gt; those rules literally to new systems you should find new<br/>&gt;&gt; rules that lead to good melody.<br/>&gt; &gt; I feel you over-simplify a bit here. By referring to medieval  &gt; examples you made it rather specific that you are talking about  &gt; counterpoint (that is, the family of medieval &quot;counterpoints&quot;, as  &gt; there are multiple medieval contrapuntal styles with different rule  &gt; sets). As you certainly know, harmony is a much younger idea, not  &gt; arriving before early Baroque. Certainly, some aspects of pre-Baroque  &gt; counterpoint already contain harmonic considerations, in particular  &gt; the cadences. Also, in Josquin music I found that ascending &quot;chord&quot;  &gt; progressions are more likely than descending progressions.</p><p>The Rules of Harmony were newer, but grew out of counterpoint.  And sometimes the Rules were codifying things that the Rules of Counterpoint didn&apos;t specify but composers did anyway.</p><p>Probably ascending/descending is an arbitrary convention.</p><p>&gt; Nevertheless, I feel it is a good idea to look at each aspect  &gt; carefully in his own right. Yes, there are some chord progressions  &gt; which are closely couples with melodic progressions. The  &gt; Neapolitanian sixth chord is a good example. Still, it is somewhat  &gt; simplifying to quasi say &quot;focus on writing good melody, that will  &gt; lead to good harmony&quot; :) Actually, in much Western music there is a  &gt; tendency the other way round, take Blues, cadentical 18-century music  &gt; or 19th century music like Wagner.</p><p>In blues the chords still serve the melody, but you don&apos;t think about counterpoint between notes of the chords.  I&apos;d very much like to understand exactly what Wagner *was* doing, at a fundamental level.  He was using the Rules of Harmony that grew out of the Rules of Counterpoint that were designed to give independent melodies that moved in harmony.</p><p>&gt;&gt; Harmony and counterpoint are different ways of looking at<br/>&gt;&gt; the same thing a lot of the time.<br/>&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt; :) Certainly, harmony and counterpoint influence each other. However,  &gt; they are precisely looking at the same thing from different points of  &gt; view. Consequently, we can end up with rather different results  &gt; depending on whether counterpoint or harmony played a more important  &gt; role -- as can be seen throughout Western music history. But this  &gt; kind of discussion is perhaps leading nowhere, because we are not  &gt; specific here :)</p><p>That&apos;s why I started with specific rules -- stepwise contrary motion, which seems to be common to different schools of counterpoint, and root motion by fifths, which seems to be common to different rules of harmony. Efficiently stating the key is a more sophisticated rule that might generally hold.  I don&apos;t know about common tones.</p><p>&gt; Thanks for pointing this out! Could you perhaps give a reference of  &gt; the Blackwood text, or provide the chord progression so that I can  &gt; follow you better. What 9-limit chords do you find in Gesualdo, 6:7:9 ??</p><p>Blackwood, E. 1985. The Structure of Recognizable Diatonic Tunings. Princeton, New Jersey: Princeton University Press.</p><p>I don&apos;t find any 9-limit chords in Gesualdo.  What I find are chords that could be re-spelled as 9-limit to avoid intervals a diesis apart within the same bar.  One example from Anchor che per amarti:</p><p>F# F# C# A#<br/>G E B B<br/>Bb E G D<br/>Bb D G D<br/>A E A C#</p><p>The A# and Bb are enharmonically equivalent in 12-equal.  Of course you can re-spell the first chord from F# to Gb but in context it has to tie in to what came before.  So an alternative is</p><p>F# F# C# Bb<br/>G E B B<br/>Bb E G D<br/>Bb D G D<br/>A E A C#</p><p>If Gesualdo had a 19 note harpsichord that would sound different to what he wrote, so we can assume he didn&apos;t intend it.  But still, if you wrote something in 12-equal and wanted to turn it into meantone, this will work.  It has a 9-limit interpretation where the car horn triad resolves onto E minor.</p><p>&gt; Also, I don&apos;t quite understand what you mean by &quot;a family<br/>&gt; of progressions for which 9-limit harmony is the *solution*<br/>&gt; to a common tone modulation problem.&quot;</p><p>Having two ways to spell a third gives you more freedom in choosing chord progressions with common tones.</p><p>&gt; Thanks for these details. Slowly changing the degree of dissonance  &gt; makes perfectly sense to me. I don&apos;t understand your scale example  &gt; though: if these are nominals, does the scale consist of only two  &gt; different and repeated pitches? I don&apos;t understand why 1 1 is an  &gt; interval larger than unison and heard as two steps.</p><p>They&apos;re intervals between nominals.  With the nominals (and a better tonic) it&apos;s</p><p>0 1 3 4 6 7 9 0<br/> 1 2 1 2 1 2 1</p><p>That isn&apos;t Rothenberg proper because intervals of one and two diatonic steps both have 2 chromatic steps.  With this specific scale that doesn&apos;t matter because 9-&gt;1 is 2^ rather than 2.  But 1-&gt;3 may sometimes be written as 1-&gt;3^ and 9-&gt;1 as 9^-&gt;1 so the interval classes overlap.  That means you need special rules to establish whether 2 chromatic steps are interpreted as a step or a leap.</p><p>Another rule I forgot: you shouldn&apos;t use quommas (0^) as melodic steps, or expose notes that differ by a quomma or octave equivalents.  I think this captures the spirit of Palestrina counterpoint.  Maybe you wouldn&apos;t follow it in real microtonal music because if you paid for all those small intervals you may as well use them.</p><p>                 Graham</p></div><h3><a id=76037 href="#76037">ðŸ”—</a>Carl Lumma &#x3C;carl@lumma.org&#x3E;</h3><span>4/24/2008 7:50:57 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>&gt; &gt; What am I missing?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Sorry for explaining poorly!

After reading it, my main question is this: how are cadencial sets (the pitches that determine a key completely) computed? Or to put it the other way round: which pitches of the key are dispensable for that purpose? You kindly explain this idea in your FAQ by examples. For example, in major the chords IV and V form a cadencial set, in other words the tone on degree III is dispensable. I see that having III or IIIb does not change the root of the scale (not considering different modes). But how is III isolated formally here?</p><p>In your composition, you applied this idea to your scale C Db Eb E F G Ab. Do you know whether this idea has been applied to scales outside 12 ET? For example, what would be the set of &quot;dispensable&quot; pitches (for tonal unambiguousness) of Erlich&apos;s decatonic scales?</p><p>Thank you!</p><p>Some other points.</p><p>It is interesting to see that you (or Mazzola) are referring to Schoenberg&apos;s explanation of modulations  (neutral phase, fundamental step, cadence) but then seemingly use minor in a sense which greatly differs from the way Schoenberg introduces minor. You are discussing the cadencial sets of harmonic minor. Schoenberg introduces minor in a way which cannot be reduced to a simple scale like that. It is related to melodic minor, but less simplifying. According to him, minor is natural minor plus the raised VI and VII degree. Additionally, the degrees VI and VII are treated with special care. In the strict form, VI# always leads to VII#, VII# -&gt; I, VII natural - &gt; VI natural and VI natural to V. On no account are chromatic intervals permitted. BTW: can we define cadencial sets for this concept of minor? How?</p><p>Several times, you mention some hypothetical listener who grew up with your scale and hears your modulations. I wonder whether the diatonic scales are just education or not something far deeper, but that&apos;s a big issue :)</p><p>Translation of Schoenberg terminology into English: I assume your term &quot;harmonic braid&quot; is a translation of Schoenberg&apos;s term &quot;harmonisches Band&quot; (i.e. common pitches between two chords). Unfortunately, I have no English translation of his book. Any idea what term is used in the &quot;official&quot; English translation?</p><p>Best<br/>Torsten</p><p>On Apr 24, 2008, at 4:05 PM, hstraub64 wrote:<br/>&gt; --- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, Torsten Anders &lt;torstenanders@...&gt;<br/>&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; On Apr 23, 2008, at 8:34 AM, hstraub64 wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; Maybe I should mention Mazzola&apos;s concept of &quot;cadencial set&quot;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; (<a href="http://home.datacomm.ch/straub/mamuth/mamufaq.html#Q_cadencialset">http://home.datacomm.ch/straub/mamuth/mamufaq.html#Q_cadencialset</a>),<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; which integrates so well with Schoenberg&apos;s modulation model<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; (<a href="http://home.datacomm.ch/straub/mamuth/mamufaq.html#Q_modul">http://home.datacomm.ch/straub/mamuth/mamufaq.html#Q_modul</a>), and<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; which I already have used successfully in microtonal contexts.<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; That sounds very interesting.

We might also add various other constraints (e.g., the tonic chord should re-appear from time to time etc.). That&apos;s what is nice about constraint programming: you just define a conjunction of conditions (other connectives like disjunction or implication and their nesting can be used as well).</p><p>Best<br/>Torsten</p><p>--<br/>Torsten Anders<br/>Interdisciplinary Centre for Computer Music Research<br/>University of Plymouth<br/>Office: +44-1752-233667<br/>Private: +44-1752-558917<br/><a href="http://strasheela.sourceforge.net">http://strasheela.sourceforge.net</a><br/><a href="http://www.torsten-anders.de">http://www.torsten-anders.de</a></p></div><h3><a id=76045 href="#76045">ðŸ”—</a>Torsten Anders &#x3C;torstenanders@gmx.de&#x3E;</h3><span>4/25/2008 4:49:42 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>On Apr 25, 2008, at 1:29 AM, Carl Lumma wrote:<br/>&gt; &gt; Could you please point me to the reference of this text?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I can do better than that!<br/>&gt; <a href="http://lumma.org/tuning/rothenberg/AModelForPatternPerception.pdf">http://lumma.org/tuning/rothenberg/AModelForPatternPerception.pdf</a></p><p>Thank you very much!</p><p>Could you perhaps even summarise Rothenberg&apos;s idea concerning which scale notes are required to recognise  a scale.

Yes, I could probably generalize<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; many (though not all) of the &quot;bad music theory papers&quot; if I<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; worked at it. And some such minimal effort would only be<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; fair in the meta-analysis I proposed. Where to draw the line<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; is another question.<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Did Schoenberg say the important thing<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; is whether the root is a member of the new chord (which is<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; a reasonable thing)? Or did he say something else?<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; Sorry, I don&apos;t fully understand your question. In an ascending<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; progression, the root of the preceding chord is a pitch in the<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; following chord.

He mentions that H. Schenker uses<br/>&gt; &gt; these<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; terms as well (&quot;aufsteigend&quot; and &quot;fallend&quot;) though in opposite<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; meaning. He remarks something like that anyone who loves Brahmsian<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; harmony would likely come up with similar concepts.<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; If you are interested I can post further formalisations/<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; generalisations of Schoenberg&apos;s rules.<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I would be interested to read them, especially if you<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; show how you generalized them. And if monz is reading,<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I bet he&apos;d be interested, too.<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; I&apos;ll write a new mail soon..<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; For example, Schoenberg<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; recommends that descending progressions should &quot;resolve&quot;. For<br/>&gt; &gt; any<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; three successive chords, if the first two chords form a<br/>&gt; &gt; descending<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; progression, then the progression from the first to the third<br/>&gt; &gt; chord<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; should form a strong or superstrong progression (so the<br/>&gt; &gt; middle chord<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; is quasi a &apos;passing chord&apos;).<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Hm... this seems kindof strange.<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; Schoenberg is always very exhaustive :) He does not want to ban<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; descending progressions, so he looks for a way how he can allow for<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; them in a way which is musically convincing in most cases. So, he<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; comes up with the idea of a &apos;passing chord&apos;.<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; Please note that he makes is always very clear that his rules are<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; guidelines for the pupil, but no laws for masterworks. This is<br/>&gt; &gt; why he<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; prefers the term &quot;descending&quot; instead of &quot;weak&quot; progressions (he<br/>&gt; &gt; uses<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; the term &quot;strong&quot; for &quot;ascending&quot; progressions a lot). Still, he<br/>&gt; &gt; does<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; not discuss where descending progressions are used to good<br/>&gt; &gt; purpose in<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; any masterwork, but such considerations have hardly a place<br/>&gt; &gt; anyway in<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; his systematic approach.<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Anyway, for chord progressions of diatonic triads in major, the<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; generalised formalisation and Schoenberg&apos;s rules are equivalent<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; (e.g., the function isAscendingProgression above returns true<br/>&gt; &gt; for<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; progressions which Schoenberg calls ascending). Still, the<br/>&gt; &gt; behaviour<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; of the constraints and Schoenberg&apos;s rules differ for more<br/>&gt; &gt; complex<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; cases. According to Schoenberg, a progression is superstrong<br/>&gt; &gt; if the<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; root interval is a step up or down.<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Bzzz. :)<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; For example, the progression V7 IV is superstrong according to<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Schoenberg. For the definitions above, however, this progression<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; is descending (!), because the root of IV is contained in V7<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; (e.g. in G7 F, the F&apos;s root pitchclass f is already contained<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; in G7). Indeed, this progression is rare in music.<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; By contrast, the progression I IIIb (e.g., C Eb) is a descending<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; progression in Schoenbergs original definition. For the<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; definitions above, however, this is an ascending progression<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; (the root of Es is not contained in C), and indeed for me the<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; progression feels strong.<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Sounds like we are really dealing with the Anders theory<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; of chord progressions. Which is probably a blessing.<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; :) As I said, I simply implemented Schoenberg&apos;s rule explanation<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; instead of his actual rules. So, I cannot accept the honour you are<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; implying.<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Let us create a sequence of 5 chords and<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; allow only for diatonic triads in C-major. The first and last<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; chord should be the tonic. Following Schoenberg let us specify<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; that ascending progressions are &quot;resolved&quot; (see above), and we<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; don&apos;t allow for superstrong progressions. Finally, the union<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; of the last three chords must contain all pitch classes of<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; C-major (i.e. these chords form a cadence).<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; This problem has only two solutions (I used the computer :).<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; These solutions are as follows. They happen to contain only<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; ascending progressions. Such solutions are particularly<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; convincing. For simplicity I given absolute chord names.<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; C-maj F-maj D-min G-maj C-maj (only ascending progressions)<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; C-maj A-min D-min G-maj C-maj (only ascending progressions)<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Only allowing for diatonic triads is C-major is a very<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; helpful constraint. Howabout we allow all 7-limit triads<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; in 31-ET, for a start?<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; The point of these generalised definitions is exactly that they<br/>&gt; &gt; allow<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; for such cases :) I only simplified for the sake of an argument. So,<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; here is a 7-limit variant. Let the scale be septimal natural minor<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; (Scala term, in 31 ET the pitches C D D# F G G# A#). Let us allow<br/>&gt; &gt; for<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; the following septimal triads (please correct my terminology if<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; necessary): harmonic diminished (5/5 6/5 7/5), subharmonic<br/>&gt; &gt; diminished<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; (7/7 7/6 7/5), subminor (6/1 7/1 9/1), supermajor (1/9 1/7 1/6).<br/>&gt; &gt; Note<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; that I consider all these chords as consonances for simplicity which<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; require neither preparation nor resolution. Naturally, we could<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; define extra rules which care for that.<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; There are 2 solutions of 5 chords with this scale, these chords and<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; the rule set specified before. For convenience, I attached these<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; solutions as PDF files (please let me know if doing so violates some<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; policies of this list).<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; The solutions are shown by two staffs. The upper stuff shows the<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; actual chord pitches (I didn&apos;t bother to implement voice leading<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; rules here, so things like Bruckner&apos;s law of the shortest path are<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; violated). The staff notation is in 31 ET (i.e. the interval C D# is<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; 7/6). The lower staff shows the chord roots in staff notation plus<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; there ratios expressed as a product of the untransposed chord ratios<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; and a root factor for each chord ratio. Some of these factors may<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; look odd at first, e.g., the first chord has the factor 4/3 for the<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; root C, but this is due to that fact that the untransposed chord<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; ratios don&apos;t contain 1/1 -- the resulting product ratios do<br/>&gt; &gt; contain 1/1.<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; If you are interested in other chord sets, scales, or longer<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; solutions then just say so -- its easy to change some numbers in a<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; computer program :)<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; Best<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; Torsten<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; --<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; Torsten Anders<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; Interdisciplinary Centre for Computer Music Research<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; University of Plymouth<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; Office: +44-1752-233667<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; Private: +44-1752-558917<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; <a href="http://strasheela.sourceforge.net">http://strasheela.sourceforge.net</a> &lt;<a href="http://strasheela.sourceforge.net">http://strasheela.sourceforge.net</a>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; <a href="http://www.torsten-anders.de">http://www.torsten-anders.de</a> &lt;<a href="http://www.torsten-anders.de">http://www.torsten-anders.de</a>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; --<br/>&gt; Torsten Anders<br/>&gt; Interdisciplinary Centre for Computer Music Research<br/>&gt; University of Plymouth<br/>&gt; Office: +44-1752-233667<br/>&gt; Private: +44-1752-558917<br/>&gt; <a href="http://strasheela.sourceforge.net">http://strasheela.sourceforge.net</a> &lt;<a href="http://strasheela.sourceforge.net">http://strasheela.sourceforge.net</a>&gt;<br/>&gt; <a href="http://www.torsten-anders.de">http://www.torsten-anders.de</a> &lt;<a href="http://www.torsten-anders.de">http://www.torsten-anders.de</a>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;</p></div><h3><a id=76048 href="#76048">ðŸ”—</a>Torsten Anders &#x3C;torstenanders@gmx.de&#x3E;</h3><span>4/25/2008 5:29:04 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>On Apr 25, 2008, at 1:16 PM, Kraig Grady wrote:<br/>&gt; I remember reading this by Schoenberg somewhere. i mean we are talking<br/>&gt; 30 years but it did strike me. where the root becomes the fifth or the<br/>&gt; fifth the third for example.<br/>&gt; Actually i remember the reverse as being the strong. c to g seems &gt; strong<br/>&gt; while G to C seems week because it it is just resolving, so a &gt; release of<br/>&gt; energy.<br/>&gt;<br/>Schoenbergs terminology is definitely the reverse (although he tries to avoid the term weak, uses descending instead).

This suggestion is based on &gt; Schoenberg&apos;s<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; guidelines on good chord root progressions where he &gt; introduces<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; the notion of ascending (strong), descending (&apos;weak&apos;) and<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; superstrong progressions (see the respective chapter in his<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Theory of Harmony). The summary of Schoenberg&apos;s &gt; guidelines/rules<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; is based on 12 ET, but his explanation is actually more &gt; general.<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; A formalisation of his explanations (instead of his actual<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; rules)<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; does work beyond 12 ET.<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; The main difference between Schoenberg&apos;s actual &gt; guidelines and<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; their formalised generalisation is that Schoenberg&apos;s &gt; guidelines<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; are based on scale degree intervals between chord roots, &gt; whereas<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; the generalisation exploits whether the root pitch class &gt; of some<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; chord is contained in the pitch class set of another chord.<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I haven&apos;t read Schoenberg&apos;s book but it sounds like you&apos;ve<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; done a bit of work for him. Yes, I could probably generalize<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; many (though not all) of the &quot;bad music theory papers&quot; if I<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; worked at it. And some such minimal effort would only be<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; fair in the meta-analysis I proposed. Where to draw the line<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; is another question.<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Did Schoenberg say the important thing<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; is whether the root is a member of the new chord (which is<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; a reasonable thing)?

In an ascending<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; progression, the root of the preceding chord is a pitch in the<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; following chord. Did you mean that?<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; OK, it follows the<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; core of is the formalisation (I hope the notation explains<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; itself:<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; defined are Boolean functions expecting two neighbouring<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; chords).<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; /* Chord1 and Chord2 have common pitch classes, but the &gt; root of<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Chord2 does not occur in the set of Chord1&apos;s &gt; pitchclasses. */<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; isAscendingProgression(Chord1, Chord2) :=<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; ( NOT ( getRoot(Chord2) \in getPitchClasses(Chord1) ) )<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; AND ( intersection(getPitchClasses(Chord1), getPitchClasses<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; (Chord2)) \= emptySet )<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; /* A non-root pitchclass of Chord1 is root in Chord2. */<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; isDescendingProgression(Chord1, Chord2) :=<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; ( getRoot(Chord2) \in getPitchClasses(Chord1) )<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; AND ( getRoot(Chord1) \= getRoot(Chord2) )<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; /* Chord1 and Chord2 have no common pitch classes */<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; isSuperstrongProgression(Chord1, Chord2) :=<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; intersection(getPitchClasses(Chord1), getPitchClasses&gt; (Chord2)) =<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; emptySet<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Yes, perfectly understandable, though I find the terms<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &quot;ascending&quot; and &quot;descending&quot; extremely odd here.<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; These are Schoenberg&apos;s terms. He mentions that H. Schenker uses<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; these<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; terms as well (&quot;aufsteigend&quot; and &quot;fallend&quot;) though in opposite<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; meaning. He remarks something like that anyone who loves &gt; Brahmsian<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; harmony would likely come up with similar concepts.<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; If you are interested I can post further formalisations/<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; generalisations of Schoenberg&apos;s rules.<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I would be interested to read them, especially if you<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; show how you generalized them. And if monz is reading,<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I bet he&apos;d be interested, too.<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I&apos;ll write a new mail soon..<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; For example, Schoenberg<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; recommends that descending progressions should &quot;resolve&quot;. &gt; For<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; any<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; three successive chords, if the first two chords form a<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; descending<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; progression, then the progression from the first to the &gt; third<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; chord<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; should form a strong or superstrong progression (so the<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; middle chord<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; is quasi a &apos;passing chord&apos;).<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Hm... this seems kindof strange.<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Schoenberg is always very exhaustive :) He does not want to ban<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; descending progressions, so he looks for a way how he can &gt; allow for<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; them in a way which is musically convincing in most cases. &gt; So, he<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; comes up with the idea of a &apos;passing chord&apos;.<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Please note that he makes is always very clear that his rules &gt; are<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; guidelines for the pupil, but no laws for masterworks. This is<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; why he<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; prefers the term &quot;descending&quot; instead of &quot;weak&quot; progressions (he<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; uses<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; the term &quot;strong&quot; for &quot;ascending&quot; progressions a lot). Still, he<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; does<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; not discuss where descending progressions are used to good<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; purpose in<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; any masterwork, but such considerations have hardly a place<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; anyway in<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; his systematic approach.<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Anyway, for chord progressions of diatonic triads in &gt; major, the<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; generalised formalisation and Schoenberg&apos;s rules are &gt; equivalent<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; (e.g., the function isAscendingProgression above returns &gt; true<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; for<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; progressions which Schoenberg calls ascending). Still, the<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; behaviour<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; of the constraints and Schoenberg&apos;s rules differ for more<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; complex<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; cases. According to Schoenberg, a progression is superstrong<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; if the<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; root interval is a step up or down.<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Bzzz. :)<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; For example, the progression V7 IV is superstrong &gt; according to<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Schoenberg. For the definitions above, however, this &gt; progression<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; is descending (!), because the root of IV is contained in V7<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; (e.g. in G7 F, the F&apos;s root pitchclass f is already &gt; contained<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; in G7). Indeed, this progression is rare in music.<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; By contrast, the progression I IIIb (e.g., C Eb) is a &gt; descending<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; progression in Schoenbergs original definition. For the<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; definitions above, however, this is an ascending progression<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; (the root of Es is not contained in C), and indeed for me &gt; the<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; progression feels strong.<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Sounds like we are really dealing with the Anders theory<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; of chord progressions. Which is probably a blessing.<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; :) As I said, I simply implemented Schoenberg&apos;s rule explanation<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; instead of his actual rules. So, I cannot accept the honour &gt; you are<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; implying.<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Let us create a sequence of 5 chords and<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; allow only for diatonic triads in C-major. The first and &gt; last<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; chord should be the tonic. Following Schoenberg let us &gt; specify<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; that ascending progressions are &quot;resolved&quot; (see above), &gt; and we<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; don&apos;t allow for superstrong progressions. Finally, the union<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; of the last three chords must contain all pitch classes of<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; C-major (i.e. these chords form a cadence).<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; This problem has only two solutions (I used the computer :).<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; These solutions are as follows. They happen to contain only<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; ascending progressions. Such solutions are particularly<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; convincing. For simplicity I given absolute chord names.<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; C-maj F-maj D-min G-maj C-maj (only ascending progressions)<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; C-maj A-min D-min G-maj C-maj (only ascending progressions)<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Only allowing for diatonic triads is C-major is a very<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; helpful constraint. Howabout we allow all 7-limit triads<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; in 31-ET, for a start?<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; The point of these generalised definitions is exactly that they<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; allow<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; for such cases :) I only simplified for the sake of an &gt; argument. So,<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; here is a 7-limit variant. Let the scale be septimal natural &gt; minor<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; (Scala term, in 31 ET the pitches C D D# F G G# A#). Let us &gt; allow<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; for<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; the following septimal triads (please correct my terminology if<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; necessary): harmonic diminished (5/5 6/5 7/5), subharmonic<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; diminished<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; (7/7 7/6 7/5), subminor (6/1 7/1 9/1), supermajor (1/9 1/7 1/6).<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; Note<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; that I consider all these chords as consonances for &gt; simplicity which<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; require neither preparation nor resolution. Naturally, we could<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; define extra rules which care for that.<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; There are 2 solutions of 5 chords with this scale, these &gt; chords and<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; the rule set specified before. For convenience, I attached these<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; solutions as PDF files (please let me know if doing so &gt; violates some<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; policies of this list).<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; The solutions are shown by two staffs. The upper stuff shows the<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; actual chord pitches (I didn&apos;t bother to implement voice leading<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; rules here, so things like Bruckner&apos;s law of the shortest &gt; path are<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; violated). The staff notation is in 31 ET (i.e. the interval &gt; C D# is<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; 7/6). The lower staff shows the chord roots in staff notation &gt; plus<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; there ratios expressed as a product of the untransposed chord &gt; ratios<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; and a root factor for each chord ratio. Some of these factors &gt; may<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; look odd at first, e.g., the first chord has the factor 4/3 &gt; for the<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; root C, but this is due to that fact that the untransposed chord<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; ratios don&apos;t contain 1/1 -- the resulting product ratios do<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; contain 1/1.<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; If you are interested in other chord sets, scales, or longer<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; solutions then just say so -- its easy to change some numbers &gt; in a<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; computer program :)<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Best<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Torsten<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; --<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Torsten Anders<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Interdisciplinary Centre for Computer Music Research<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; University of Plymouth<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Office: +44-1752-233667<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Private: +44-1752-558917<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; <a href="http://strasheela.sourceforge.net">http://strasheela.sourceforge.net</a> &lt;http://&gt; <a href="http://strasheela.sourceforge.net">strasheela.sourceforge.net</a>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; <a href="http://www.torsten-anders.de">http://www.torsten-anders.de</a> &lt;<a href="http://www.torsten-anders.de">http://www.torsten-anders.de</a>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; --<br/>&gt; &gt; Torsten Anders<br/>&gt; &gt; Interdisciplinary Centre for Computer Music Research<br/>&gt; &gt; University of Plymouth<br/>&gt; &gt; Office: +44-1752-233667<br/>&gt; &gt; Private: +44-1752-558917<br/>&gt; &gt; <a href="http://strasheela.sourceforge.net">http://strasheela.sourceforge.net</a> &lt;http://&gt; <a href="http://strasheela.sourceforge.net">strasheela.sourceforge.net</a>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; <a href="http://www.torsten-anders.de">http://www.torsten-anders.de</a> &lt;<a href="http://www.torsten-anders.de">http://www.torsten-anders.de</a>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>--<br/>Torsten Anders<br/>Interdisciplinary Centre for Computer Music Research<br/>University of Plymouth<br/>Office: +44-1752-233667<br/>Private: +44-1752-558917<br/><a href="http://strasheela.sourceforge.net">http://strasheela.sourceforge.net</a><br/><a href="http://www.torsten-anders.de">http://www.torsten-anders.de</a></p></div><h3><a id=76049 href="#76049">ðŸ”—</a>Kraig Grady &#x3C;kraiggrady@anaphoria.com&#x3E;</h3><span>4/25/2008 5:37:08 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>i am sure translation is part of the problem.

This suggestion is based on<br/>&gt; &gt; Schoenberg&apos;s<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; guidelines on good chord root progressions where he<br/>&gt; &gt; introduces<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; the notion of ascending (strong), descending (&apos;weak&apos;) and<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; superstrong progressions (see the respective chapter in his<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Theory of Harmony). The summary of Schoenberg&apos;s<br/>&gt; &gt; guidelines/rules<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; is based on 12 ET, but his explanation is actually more<br/>&gt; &gt; general.<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; A formalisation of his explanations (instead of his actual<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; rules)<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; does work beyond 12 ET.<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; The main difference between Schoenberg&apos;s actual<br/>&gt; &gt; guidelines and<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; their formalised generalisation is that Schoenberg&apos;s<br/>&gt; &gt; guidelines<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; are based on scale degree intervals between chord roots,<br/>&gt; &gt; whereas<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; the generalisation exploits whether the root pitch class<br/>&gt; &gt; of some<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; chord is contained in the pitch class set of another chord.<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I haven&apos;t read Schoenberg&apos;s book but it sounds like you&apos;ve<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; done a bit of work for him. Yes, I could probably generalize<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; many (though not all) of the &quot;bad music theory papers&quot; if I<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; worked at it. And some such minimal effort would only be<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; fair in the meta-analysis I proposed. Where to draw the line<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; is another question.<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Did Schoenberg say the important thing<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; is whether the root is a member of the new chord (which is<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; a reasonable thing)? Or did he say something else?<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Sorry, I don&apos;t fully understand your question. In an ascending<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; progression, the root of the preceding chord is a pitch in the<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; following chord.

This is<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; why he<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; prefers the term &quot;descending&quot; instead of &quot;weak&quot; progressions (he<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; uses<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; the term &quot;strong&quot; for &quot;ascending&quot; progressions a lot). Still, he<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; does<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; not discuss where descending progressions are used to good<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; purpose in<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; any masterwork, but such considerations have hardly a place<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; anyway in<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; his systematic approach.<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Anyway, for chord progressions of diatonic triads in<br/>&gt; &gt; major, the<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; generalised formalisation and Schoenberg&apos;s rules are<br/>&gt; &gt; equivalent<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; (e.g., the function isAscendingProgression above returns<br/>&gt; &gt; true<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; for<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; progressions which Schoenberg calls ascending). Still, the<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; behaviour<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; of the constraints and Schoenberg&apos;s rules differ for more<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; complex<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; cases. According to Schoenberg, a progression is superstrong<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; if the<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; root interval is a step up or down.<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Bzzz. :)<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; For example, the progression V7 IV is superstrong<br/>&gt; &gt; according to<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Schoenberg. For the definitions above, however, this<br/>&gt; &gt; progression<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; is descending (!), because the root of IV is contained in V7<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; (e.g. in G7 F, the F&apos;s root pitchclass f is already<br/>&gt; &gt; contained<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; in G7). Indeed, this progression is rare in music.<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; By contrast, the progression I IIIb (e.g., C Eb) is a<br/>&gt; &gt; descending<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; progression in Schoenbergs original definition. For the<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; definitions above, however, this is an ascending progression<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; (the root of Es is not contained in C), and indeed for me<br/>&gt; &gt; the<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; progression feels strong.<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Sounds like we are really dealing with the Anders theory<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; of chord progressions. Which is probably a blessing.<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; :) As I said, I simply implemented Schoenberg&apos;s rule explanation<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; instead of his actual rules. So, I cannot accept the honour<br/>&gt; &gt; you are<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; implying.<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Let us create a sequence of 5 chords and<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; allow only for diatonic triads in C-major. The first and<br/>&gt; &gt; last<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; chord should be the tonic. Following Schoenberg let us<br/>&gt; &gt; specify<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; that ascending progressions are &quot;resolved&quot; (see above),<br/>&gt; &gt; and we<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; don&apos;t allow for superstrong progressions. Finally, the union<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; of the last three chords must contain all pitch classes of<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; C-major (i.e. these chords form a cadence).<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; This problem has only two solutions (I used the computer :).<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; These solutions are as follows. They happen to contain only<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; ascending progressions. Such solutions are particularly<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; convincing. For simplicity I given absolute chord names.<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; C-maj F-maj D-min G-maj C-maj (only ascending progressions)<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; C-maj A-min D-min G-maj C-maj (only ascending progressions)<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Only allowing for diatonic triads is C-major is a very<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; helpful constraint. Howabout we allow all 7-limit triads<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; in 31-ET, for a start?<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; The point of these generalised definitions is exactly that they<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; allow<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; for such cases :) I only simplified for the sake of an<br/>&gt; &gt; argument. So,<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; here is a 7-limit variant. Let the scale be septimal natural<br/>&gt; &gt; minor<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; (Scala term, in 31 ET the pitches C D D# F G G# A#). Let us<br/>&gt; &gt; allow<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; for<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; the following septimal triads (please correct my terminology if<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; necessary): harmonic diminished (5/5 6/5 7/5), subharmonic<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; diminished<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; (7/7 7/6 7/5), subminor (6/1 7/1 9/1), supermajor (1/9 1/7 1/6).<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Note<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; that I consider all these chords as consonances for<br/>&gt; &gt; simplicity which<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; require neither preparation nor resolution. Naturally, we could<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; define extra rules which care for that.<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; There are 2 solutions of 5 chords with this scale, these<br/>&gt; &gt; chords and<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; the rule set specified before. For convenience, I attached these<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; solutions as PDF files (please let me know if doing so<br/>&gt; &gt; violates some<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; policies of this list).<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; The solutions are shown by two staffs. The upper stuff shows the<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; actual chord pitches (I didn&apos;t bother to implement voice leading<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; rules here, so things like Bruckner&apos;s law of the shortest<br/>&gt; &gt; path are<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; violated). The staff notation is in 31 ET (i.e. the interval<br/>&gt; &gt; C D# is<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; 7/6). The lower staff shows the chord roots in staff notation<br/>&gt; &gt; plus<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; there ratios expressed as a product of the untransposed chord<br/>&gt; &gt; ratios<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; and a root factor for each chord ratio. Some of these factors<br/>&gt; &gt; may<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; look odd at first, e.g., the first chord has the factor 4/3<br/>&gt; &gt; for the<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; root C, but this is due to that fact that the untransposed chord<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; ratios don&apos;t contain 1/1 -- the resulting product ratios do<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; contain 1/1.<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; If you are interested in other chord sets, scales, or longer<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; solutions then just say so -- its easy to change some numbers<br/>&gt; &gt; in a<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; computer program :)<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Best<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Torsten<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; --<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Torsten Anders<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Interdisciplinary Centre for Computer Music Research<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; University of Plymouth<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Office: +44-1752-233667<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Private: +44-1752-558917<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; <a href="http://strasheela.sourceforge.net">http://strasheela.sourceforge.net</a> &gt; &lt;<a href="http://strasheela.sourceforge.net">http://strasheela.sourceforge.net</a>&gt; &lt;http://<br/>&gt; &gt; <a href="http://strasheela.sourceforge.net">strasheela.sourceforge.net</a>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; <a href="http://www.torsten-anders.de">http://www.torsten-anders.de</a> &lt;<a href="http://www.torsten-anders.de">http://www.torsten-anders.de</a>&gt; &gt; &lt;<a href="http://www.torsten-anders.de">http://www.torsten-anders.de</a> &lt;<a href="http://www.torsten-anders.de">http://www.torsten-anders.de</a>&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; --<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; Torsten Anders<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; Interdisciplinary Centre for Computer Music Research<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; University of Plymouth<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; Office: +44-1752-233667<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; Private: +44-1752-558917<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; <a href="http://strasheela.sourceforge.net">http://strasheela.sourceforge.net</a> &gt; &lt;<a href="http://strasheela.sourceforge.net">http://strasheela.sourceforge.net</a>&gt; &lt;http://<br/>&gt; &gt; <a href="http://strasheela.sourceforge.net">strasheela.sourceforge.net</a>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; <a href="http://www.torsten-anders.de">http://www.torsten-anders.de</a> &lt;<a href="http://www.torsten-anders.de">http://www.torsten-anders.de</a>&gt; &gt; &lt;<a href="http://www.torsten-anders.de">http://www.torsten-anders.de</a> &lt;<a href="http://www.torsten-anders.de">http://www.torsten-anders.de</a>&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; --<br/>&gt; Torsten Anders<br/>&gt; Interdisciplinary Centre for Computer Music Research<br/>&gt; University of Plymouth<br/>&gt; Office: +44-1752-233667<br/>&gt; Private: +44-1752-558917<br/>&gt; <a href="http://strasheela.sourceforge.net">http://strasheela.sourceforge.net</a> &lt;<a href="http://strasheela.sourceforge.net">http://strasheela.sourceforge.net</a>&gt;<br/>&gt; <a href="http://www.torsten-anders.de">http://www.torsten-anders.de</a> &lt;<a href="http://www.torsten-anders.de">http://www.torsten-anders.de</a>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;</p></div><h3><a id=76050 href="#76050">ðŸ”—</a>Torsten Anders &#x3C;torstenanders@gmx.de&#x3E;</h3><span>4/25/2008 5:42:16 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Dear Carl</p><p>Concerning your explanation at<br/><a href="http://lumma.org/music/theory/ModulationStrength.txt">http://lumma.org/music/theory/ModulationStrength.txt</a></p><p>&gt;  |log2(pitchA)-log2(pitchB)| * 1200           Eq.2</p><p>Why not something like the following?</p><p> log2( | pitchA - pitchB | )</p><p>Best<br/>Torsten</p><p>On Apr 25, 2008, at 12:46 PM, Torsten Anders wrote:<br/>&gt; Thanks also for detailing the voice leading subject.

Could you please<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; detail this further?<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Thank you!<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Best<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Torsten<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; /^_,&apos;,&apos;,&apos;,_ //^ /Kraig Grady_ ^_,&apos;,&apos;,&apos;,_<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; _&apos;&apos;&apos;&apos;&apos;&apos;&apos;_ ^North/Western Hemisphere:<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; North American Embassy of Anaphoria Island<br/>&gt; &gt; &lt;<a href="http://anaphoria.com/">http://anaphoria.com/</a> &lt;<a href="http://anaphoria.com/">http://anaphoria.com/</a>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;<a href="http://anaphoria.com/">http://anaphoria.com/</a> &lt;<a href="http://anaphoria.com/">http://anaphoria.com/</a>&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; _&apos;&apos;&apos;&apos;&apos;&apos;&apos;_ ^South/Eastern Hemisphere:<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Austronesian Outpost of Anaphoria &lt;http://<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; <a href="http://anaphoriasouth.blogspot.com/">anaphoriasouth.blogspot.com/</a>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &apos;,&apos;,&apos;,&apos;,&apos;,&apos;,&apos;,&apos;,&apos;,&apos;,&apos;,&apos;,&apos;,&apos;,&apos;,&apos;,&apos;,&apos;,&apos;,&apos;,&apos;,&apos;,&apos;,&apos;,&apos;,&apos;,&apos;,&apos;,&apos;,<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Torsten Anders wrote:<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Dear Carl,<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; On Apr 22, 2008, at 7:19 PM, Carl Lumma wrote:<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Here is a suggestion I can make for guidelines on &gt; good chord<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; progressions, which is indeed based on the notion of<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; pitch class<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; sets, but which also works beyond 12 ET (e.g., I did<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; examples<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; using them with 31 ET). This suggestion is based on<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; Schoenberg&apos;s<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; guidelines on good chord root progressions where he<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; introduces<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; the notion of ascending (strong), descending (&apos;weak&apos;) &gt; and<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; superstrong progressions (see the respective chapter &gt; in his<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Theory of Harmony). The summary of Schoenberg&apos;s<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; guidelines/rules<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; is based on 12 ET, but his explanation is actually more<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; general.<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; A formalisation of his explanations (instead of his &gt; actual<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; rules)<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; does work beyond 12 ET.<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; The main difference between Schoenberg&apos;s actual<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; guidelines and<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; their formalised generalisation is that Schoenberg&apos;s<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; guidelines<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; are based on scale degree intervals between chord roots,<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; whereas<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; the generalisation exploits whether the root pitch class<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; of some<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; chord is contained in the pitch class set of another &gt; chord.<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I haven&apos;t read Schoenberg&apos;s book but it sounds like you&apos;ve<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; done a bit of work for him. Yes, I could probably &gt; generalize<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; many (though not all) of the &quot;bad music theory papers&quot; &gt; if I<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; worked at it. And some such minimal effort would only be<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; fair in the meta-analysis I proposed. Where to draw the &gt; line<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; is another question.<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Did Schoenberg say the important thing<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; is whether the root is a member of the new chord (which is<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; a reasonable thing)? Or did he say something else?<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Sorry, I don&apos;t fully understand your question. In an &gt; ascending<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; progression, the root of the preceding chord is a pitch &gt; in the<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; following chord. Did you mean that?<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; OK, it follows the<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; core of is the formalisation (I hope the notation &gt; explains<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; itself:<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; defined are Boolean functions expecting two neighbouring<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; chords).<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; /* Chord1 and Chord2 have common pitch classes, but the<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; root of<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Chord2 does not occur in the set of Chord1&apos;s<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; pitchclasses. */<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; isAscendingProgression(Chord1, Chord2) :=<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; ( NOT ( getRoot(Chord2) \in getPitchClasses(Chord1) ) )<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; AND ( intersection(getPitchClasses(Chord1), &gt; getPitchClasses<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; (Chord2)) \= emptySet )<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; /* A non-root pitchclass of Chord1 is root in Chord2. */<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; isDescendingProgression(Chord1, Chord2) :=<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; ( getRoot(Chord2) \in getPitchClasses(Chord1) )<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; AND ( getRoot(Chord1) \= getRoot(Chord2) )<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; /* Chord1 and Chord2 have no common pitch classes */<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; isSuperstrongProgression(Chord1, Chord2) :=<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; intersection(getPitchClasses(Chord1), getPitchClasses<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; (Chord2)) =<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; emptySet<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Yes, perfectly understandable, though I find the terms<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &quot;ascending&quot; and &quot;descending&quot; extremely odd here.<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; These are Schoenberg&apos;s terms. He mentions that H. &gt; Schenker uses<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; these<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; terms as well (&quot;aufsteigend&quot; and &quot;fallend&quot;) though in &gt; opposite<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; meaning. He remarks something like that anyone who loves<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; Brahmsian<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; harmony would likely come up with similar concepts.<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; If you are interested I can post further formalisations/<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; generalisations of Schoenberg&apos;s rules.<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I would be interested to read them, especially if you<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; show how you generalized them. And if monz is reading,<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I bet he&apos;d be interested, too.<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I&apos;ll write a new mail soon..<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; For example, Schoenberg<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; recommends that descending progressions should &gt; &quot;resolve&quot;.<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; For<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; any<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; three successive chords, if the first two chords form a<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; descending<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; progression, then the progression from the first to the<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; third<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; chord<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; should form a strong or superstrong progression (so the<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; middle chord<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; is quasi a &apos;passing chord&apos;).<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Hm... this seems kindof strange.<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Schoenberg is always very exhaustive :) He does not want &gt; to ban<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; descending progressions, so he looks for a way how he can<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; allow for<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; them in a way which is musically convincing in most cases.<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; So, he<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; comes up with the idea of a &apos;passing chord&apos;.<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Please note that he makes is always very clear that his &gt; rules<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; are<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; guidelines for the pupil, but no laws for masterworks. &gt; This is<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; why he<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; prefers the term &quot;descending&quot; instead of &quot;weak&quot; &gt; progressions (he<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; uses<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; the term &quot;strong&quot; for &quot;ascending&quot; progressions a lot). &gt; Still, he<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; does<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; not discuss where descending progressions are used to good<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; purpose in<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; any masterwork, but such considerations have hardly a place<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; anyway in<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; his systematic approach.<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Anyway, for chord progressions of diatonic triads in<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; major, the<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; generalised formalisation and Schoenberg&apos;s rules are<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; equivalent<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; (e.g., the function isAscendingProgression above returns<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; true<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; for<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; progressions which Schoenberg calls ascending). &gt; Still, the<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; behaviour<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; of the constraints and Schoenberg&apos;s rules differ for &gt; more<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; complex<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; cases. According to Schoenberg, a progression is &gt; superstrong<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; if the<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; root interval is a step up or down.<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Bzzz. :)<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; For example, the progression V7 IV is superstrong<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; according to<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Schoenberg. For the definitions above, however, this<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; progression<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; is descending (!), because the root of IV is &gt; contained in V7<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; (e.g. in G7 F, the F&apos;s root pitchclass f is already<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; contained<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; in G7). Indeed, this progression is rare in music.<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; By contrast, the progression I IIIb (e.g., C Eb) is a<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; descending<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; progression in Schoenbergs original definition. For the<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; definitions above, however, this is an ascending &gt; progression<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; (the root of Es is not contained in C), and indeed &gt; for me<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; the<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; progression feels strong.<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Sounds like we are really dealing with the Anders theory<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; of chord progressions. Which is probably a blessing.<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; :) As I said, I simply implemented Schoenberg&apos;s rule &gt; explanation<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; instead of his actual rules. So, I cannot accept the honour<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; you are<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; implying.<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Let us create a sequence of 5 chords and<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; allow only for diatonic triads in C-major. The first and<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; last<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; chord should be the tonic. Following Schoenberg let us<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; specify<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; that ascending progressions are &quot;resolved&quot; (see above),<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; and we<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; don&apos;t allow for superstrong progressions. Finally, &gt; the union<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; of the last three chords must contain all pitch &gt; classes of<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; C-major (i.e. these chords form a cadence).<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; This problem has only two solutions (I used the &gt; computer :).<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; These solutions are as follows. They happen to &gt; contain only<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; ascending progressions. Such solutions are particularly<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; convincing. For simplicity I given absolute chord names.<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; C-maj F-maj D-min G-maj C-maj (only ascending &gt; progressions)<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; C-maj A-min D-min G-maj C-maj (only ascending &gt; progressions)<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Only allowing for diatonic triads is C-major is a very<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; helpful constraint. Howabout we allow all 7-limit triads<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; in 31-ET, for a start?<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; The point of these generalised definitions is exactly &gt; that they<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; allow<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; for such cases :) I only simplified for the sake of an<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; argument. So,<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; here is a 7-limit variant. Let the scale be septimal natural<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; minor<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; (Scala term, in 31 ET the pitches C D D# F G G# A#). Let us<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; allow<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; for<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; the following septimal triads (please correct my &gt; terminology if<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; necessary): harmonic diminished (5/5 6/5 7/5), subharmonic<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; diminished<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; (7/7 7/6 7/5), subminor (6/1 7/1 9/1), supermajor (1/9 &gt; 1/7 1/6).<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Note<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; that I consider all these chords as consonances for<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; simplicity which<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; require neither preparation nor resolution. Naturally, we &gt; could<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; define extra rules which care for that.<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; There are 2 solutions of 5 chords with this scale, these<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; chords and<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; the rule set specified before. For convenience, I &gt; attached these<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; solutions as PDF files (please let me know if doing so<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; violates some<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; policies of this list).<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; The solutions are shown by two staffs. The upper stuff &gt; shows the<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; actual chord pitches (I didn&apos;t bother to implement voice &gt; leading<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; rules here, so things like Bruckner&apos;s law of the shortest<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; path are<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; violated). The staff notation is in 31 ET (i.e. the interval<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; C D# is<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; 7/6). The lower staff shows the chord roots in staff &gt; notation<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; plus<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; there ratios expressed as a product of the untransposed &gt; chord<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; ratios<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; and a root factor for each chord ratio. Some of these &gt; factors<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; may<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; look odd at first, e.g., the first chord has the factor 4/3<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; for the<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; root C, but this is due to that fact that the &gt; untransposed chord<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; ratios don&apos;t contain 1/1 -- the resulting product ratios do<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; contain 1/1.<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; If you are interested in other chord sets, scales, or longer<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; solutions then just say so -- its easy to change some &gt; numbers<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; in a<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; computer program :)<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Best<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Torsten<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; --<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Torsten Anders<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Interdisciplinary Centre for Computer Music Research<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; University of Plymouth<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Office: +44-1752-233667<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Private: +44-1752-558917<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; <a href="http://strasheela.sourceforge.net">http://strasheela.sourceforge.net</a><br/>&gt; &gt; &lt;<a href="http://strasheela.sourceforge.net">http://strasheela.sourceforge.net</a>&gt; &lt;http://<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; <a href="http://strasheela.sourceforge.net">strasheela.sourceforge.net</a>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; <a href="http://www.torsten-anders.de">http://www.torsten-anders.de</a> &lt;<a href="http://www.torsten-anders.de">http://www.torsten-anders.de</a>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &lt;<a href="http://www.torsten-anders.de">http://www.torsten-anders.de</a> &lt;<a href="http://www.torsten-anders.de">http://www.torsten-anders.de</a>&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; --<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Torsten Anders<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Interdisciplinary Centre for Computer Music Research<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; University of Plymouth<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Office: +44-1752-233667<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Private: +44-1752-558917<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; <a href="http://strasheela.sourceforge.net">http://strasheela.sourceforge.net</a><br/>&gt; &gt; &lt;<a href="http://strasheela.sourceforge.net">http://strasheela.sourceforge.net</a>&gt; &lt;http://<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; <a href="http://strasheela.sourceforge.net">strasheela.sourceforge.net</a>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; <a href="http://www.torsten-anders.de">http://www.torsten-anders.de</a> &lt;<a href="http://www.torsten-anders.de">http://www.torsten-anders.de</a>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &lt;<a href="http://www.torsten-anders.de">http://www.torsten-anders.de</a> &lt;<a href="http://www.torsten-anders.de">http://www.torsten-anders.de</a>&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; --<br/>&gt; &gt; Torsten Anders<br/>&gt; &gt; Interdisciplinary Centre for Computer Music Research<br/>&gt; &gt; University of Plymouth<br/>&gt; &gt; Office: +44-1752-233667<br/>&gt; &gt; Private: +44-1752-558917<br/>&gt; &gt; <a href="http://strasheela.sourceforge.net">http://strasheela.sourceforge.net</a> &lt;http://&gt; <a href="http://strasheela.sourceforge.net">strasheela.sourceforge.net</a>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; <a href="http://www.torsten-anders.de">http://www.torsten-anders.de</a> &lt;<a href="http://www.torsten-anders.de">http://www.torsten-anders.de</a>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>--<br/>Torsten Anders<br/>Interdisciplinary Centre for Computer Music Research<br/>University of Plymouth<br/>Office: +44-1752-233667<br/>Private: +44-1752-558917<br/><a href="http://strasheela.sourceforge.net">http://strasheela.sourceforge.net</a><br/><a href="http://www.torsten-anders.de">http://www.torsten-anders.de</a></p></div><h3><a id=76052 href="#76052">ðŸ”—</a>Kraig Grady &#x3C;kraiggrady@anaphoria.com&#x3E;</h3><span>4/25/2008 6:21:50 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>I was thinking of the higher harmonics as consonances ( which they are more so than not).

In an<br/>&gt; &gt; ascending<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; progression, the root of the preceding chord is a pitch<br/>&gt; &gt; in the<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; following chord. Did you mean that?<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; OK, it follows the<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; core of is the formalisation (I hope the notation<br/>&gt; &gt; explains<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; itself:<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; defined are Boolean functions expecting two neighbouring<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; chords).<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; /* Chord1 and Chord2 have common pitch classes, but the<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; root of<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Chord2 does not occur in the set of Chord1&apos;s<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; pitchclasses. */<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; isAscendingProgression(Chord1, Chord2) :=<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; ( NOT ( getRoot(Chord2) \in getPitchClasses(Chord1) ) )<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; AND ( intersection(getPitchClasses(Chord1),<br/>&gt; &gt; getPitchClasses<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; (Chord2)) \= emptySet )<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; /* A non-root pitchclass of Chord1 is root in Chord2. */<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; isDescendingProgression(Chord1, Chord2) :=<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; ( getRoot(Chord2) \in getPitchClasses(Chord1) )<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; AND ( getRoot(Chord1) \= getRoot(Chord2) )<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; /* Chord1 and Chord2 have no common pitch classes */<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; isSuperstrongProgression(Chord1, Chord2) :=<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; intersection(getPitchClasses(Chord1), getPitchClasses<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; (Chord2)) =<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; emptySet<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Yes, perfectly understandable, though I find the terms<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &quot;ascending&quot; and &quot;descending&quot; extremely odd here.<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; These are Schoenberg&apos;s terms. He mentions that H.<br/>&gt; &gt; Schenker uses<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; these<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; terms as well (&quot;aufsteigend&quot; and &quot;fallend&quot;) though in<br/>&gt; &gt; opposite<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; meaning. He remarks something like that anyone who loves<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Brahmsian<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; harmony would likely come up with similar concepts.<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; If you are interested I can post further formalisations/<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; generalisations of Schoenberg&apos;s rules.<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I would be interested to read them, especially if you<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; show how you generalized them. And if monz is reading,<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I bet he&apos;d be interested, too.<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I&apos;ll write a new mail soon..<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; For example, Schoenberg<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; recommends that descending progressions should<br/>&gt; &gt; &quot;resolve&quot;.<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; For<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; any<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; three successive chords, if the first two chords form a<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; descending<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; progression, then the progression from the first to the<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; third<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; chord<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; should form a strong or superstrong progression (so the<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; middle chord<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; is quasi a &apos;passing chord&apos;).<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Hm... this seems kindof strange.<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Schoenberg is always very exhaustive :) He does not want<br/>&gt; &gt; to ban<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; descending progressions, so he looks for a way how he can<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; allow for<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; them in a way which is musically convincing in most cases.<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; So, he<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; comes up with the idea of a &apos;passing chord&apos;.<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Please note that he makes is always very clear that his<br/>&gt; &gt; rules<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; are<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; guidelines for the pupil, but no laws for masterworks.<br/>&gt; &gt; This is<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; why he<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; prefers the term &quot;descending&quot; instead of &quot;weak&quot;<br/>&gt; &gt; progressions (he<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; uses<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; the term &quot;strong&quot; for &quot;ascending&quot; progressions a lot).<br/>&gt; &gt; Still, he<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; does<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; not discuss where descending progressions are used to good<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; purpose in<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; any masterwork, but such considerations have hardly a place<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; anyway in<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; his systematic approach.<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Anyway, for chord progressions of diatonic triads in<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; major, the<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; generalised formalisation and Schoenberg&apos;s rules are<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; equivalent<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; (e.g., the function isAscendingProgression above returns<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; true<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; for<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; progressions which Schoenberg calls ascending).<br/>&gt; &gt; Still, the<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; behaviour<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; of the constraints and Schoenberg&apos;s rules differ for<br/>&gt; &gt; more<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; complex<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; cases. According to Schoenberg, a progression is<br/>&gt; &gt; superstrong<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; if the<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; root interval is a step up or down.<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Bzzz. :)<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; For example, the progression V7 IV is superstrong<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; according to<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Schoenberg. For the definitions above, however, this<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; progression<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; is descending (!), because the root of IV is<br/>&gt; &gt; contained in V7<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; (e.g. in G7 F, the F&apos;s root pitchclass f is already<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; contained<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; in G7). Indeed, this progression is rare in music.<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; By contrast, the progression I IIIb (e.g., C Eb) is a<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; descending<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; progression in Schoenbergs original definition. For the<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; definitions above, however, this is an ascending<br/>&gt; &gt; progression<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; (the root of Es is not contained in C), and indeed<br/>&gt; &gt; for me<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; the<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; progression feels strong.<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Sounds like we are really dealing with the Anders theory<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; of chord progressions. Which is probably a blessing.<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; :) As I said, I simply implemented Schoenberg&apos;s rule<br/>&gt; &gt; explanation<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; instead of his actual rules. So, I cannot accept the honour<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; you are<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; implying.<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Let us create a sequence of 5 chords and<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; allow only for diatonic triads in C-major. The first and<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; last<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; chord should be the tonic. Following Schoenberg let us<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; specify<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; that ascending progressions are &quot;resolved&quot; (see above),<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; and we<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; don&apos;t allow for superstrong progressions. Finally,<br/>&gt; &gt; the union<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; of the last three chords must contain all pitch<br/>&gt; &gt; classes of<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; C-major (i.e. these chords form a cadence).<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; This problem has only two solutions (I used the<br/>&gt; &gt; computer :).<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; These solutions are as follows. They happen to<br/>&gt; &gt; contain only<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; ascending progressions. Such solutions are particularly<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; convincing. For simplicity I given absolute chord names.<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; C-maj F-maj D-min G-maj C-maj (only ascending<br/>&gt; &gt; progressions)<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; C-maj A-min D-min G-maj C-maj (only ascending<br/>&gt; &gt; progressions)<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Only allowing for diatonic triads is C-major is a very<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; helpful constraint. Howabout we allow all 7-limit triads<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; in 31-ET, for a start?<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; The point of these generalised definitions is exactly<br/>&gt; &gt; that they<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; allow<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; for such cases :) I only simplified for the sake of an<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; argument. So,<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; here is a 7-limit variant. Let the scale be septimal natural<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; minor<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; (Scala term, in 31 ET the pitches C D D# F G G# A#). Let us<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; allow<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; for<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; the following septimal triads (please correct my<br/>&gt; &gt; terminology if<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; necessary): harmonic diminished (5/5 6/5 7/5), subharmonic<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; diminished<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; (7/7 7/6 7/5), subminor (6/1 7/1 9/1), supermajor (1/9<br/>&gt; &gt; 1/7 1/6).<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Note<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; that I consider all these chords as consonances for<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; simplicity which<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; require neither preparation nor resolution. Naturally, we<br/>&gt; &gt; could<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; define extra rules which care for that.<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; There are 2 solutions of 5 chords with this scale, these<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; chords and<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; the rule set specified before. For convenience, I<br/>&gt; &gt; attached these<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; solutions as PDF files (please let me know if doing so<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; violates some<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; policies of this list).<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; The solutions are shown by two staffs. The upper stuff<br/>&gt; &gt; shows the<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; actual chord pitches (I didn&apos;t bother to implement voice<br/>&gt; &gt; leading<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; rules here, so things like Bruckner&apos;s law of the shortest<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; path are<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; violated). The staff notation is in 31 ET (i.e. the interval<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; C D# is<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; 7/6). The lower staff shows the chord roots in staff<br/>&gt; &gt; notation<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; plus<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; there ratios expressed as a product of the untransposed<br/>&gt; &gt; chord<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; ratios<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; and a root factor for each chord ratio. Some of these<br/>&gt; &gt; factors<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; may<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; look odd at first, e.g., the first chord has the factor 4/3<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; for the<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; root C, but this is due to that fact that the<br/>&gt; &gt; untransposed chord<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; ratios don&apos;t contain 1/1 -- the resulting product ratios do<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; contain 1/1.<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; If you are interested in other chord sets, scales, or longer<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; solutions then just say so -- its easy to change some<br/>&gt; &gt; numbers<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; in a<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; computer program :)<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;

After reading it, my<br/>&gt; main  question is this: how are cadencial sets (the pitches that<br/>&gt; determine a key completely) computed? Or to put it the other way<br/>&gt; round: which pitches of the key are dispensable for that purpose?<br/>&gt; You kindly explain this idea in your FAQ by examples. For example,<br/>&gt; in major the chords IV and V form a cadencial set, in other words<br/>&gt; the tone on degree III is dispensable. I see that having III or IIIb<br/>&gt; does not change the root of the scale (not considering different<br/>&gt; modes). But how is III isolated formally here?<br/>&gt;</p><p>The point is that when you perform an arbitrary transposition (pitch<br/>shift) on the chord set {IV, V}, you necessarily leave the tonality -<br/>where as, e.g., {V, I} can be transposed up one forth, resulting in<br/>{I, IV} of the same major key. So if you hear only V-I or I-V in,<br/>e.g., C major, you cannot be 100% sure whether it is not I-IV (or<br/>IV-I, respectively) in G major - a thing that cannot happen with IV-V.</p><p>&gt; In your composition, you applied this idea to your scale C Db Eb E F<br/>&gt; G Ab. Do you know whether this idea has been applied to scales<br/>&gt; outside 12 ET? For example, what would be the set of &quot;dispensable&quot;<br/>&gt; pitches (for tonal unambiguousness) of Erlich&apos;s decatonic scales?<br/>&gt;</p><p>I once calculated the cadence-sets for the pentachordal decatonic<br/>scale.

I am a<br/>little out of the MaMuTh scene by now... Maybe Thomas Noll knows.</p><p>&gt;<br/>&gt; Some other points.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; It is interesting to see that you (or Mazzola) are referring to<br/>&gt; Schoenberg&apos;s explanation of modulations  (neutral phase, fundamental<br/>&gt; step, cadence) but then seemingly use minor in a sense which greatly<br/>&gt; differs from the way Schoenberg introduces minor. You are discussing<br/>&gt; the cadencial sets of harmonic minor. Schoenberg introduces minor in<br/>&gt; a way which cannot be reduced to a simple scale like that. It is<br/>&gt; related to melodic minor, but less simplifying.</p><p>Well, yes, Mazzola&apos;s modulation theory does not do a perfect<br/>description of traditional harmony as used by composers. It is a<br/>highly simplified model covering only certain aspects.</p><p>&gt;<br/>&gt; Several times, you mention some hypothetical listener who grew up<br/>&gt; with your scale and hears your modulations. I wonder whether the<br/>&gt; diatonic scales are just education or not something far deeper, but<br/>&gt; that&apos;s a big issue :)<br/>&gt;</p><p>That is one question behind all this! And the idea is: to find out why<br/>rules are like they are, just break the rules and look what happens...</p><p>&gt; Translation of Schoenberg terminology into English: I assume your<br/>&gt; term &quot;harmonic braid&quot; is a translation of Schoenberg&apos;s term<br/>&gt; &quot;harmonisches Band&quot; (i.e. common pitches between two chords).<br/>&gt; Unfortunately, I have no English translation of his book.
