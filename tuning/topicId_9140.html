Maneri&apos;s influence has yet to have been felt to<br/>its full extent, however, as many of the musicians he has been<br/>teaching at the New England Conservatory, such as keyboardist Jamie<br/>Saft and trumpeter Cuong Vu, are just beginning to come into<br/>prominence.</p><p>Seven of the eight tracks on Paniots Nine were cut in 1963 with Maneri<br/>on clarinet and tenor sax plus pianist Don Burns, bassist John Beal,<br/>and drummer Pete Dolger. On the final track, Maneri plays clarinet<br/>with Greg Silberman in 1981 at a concert of Jewish music.</p><p>Some elements of his music that you&apos;ll likely hear even more of in the<br/>new millennium are his employment of microtones (the notes between the<br/>notes recognized in a Western scale) and his blending of jazz, free<br/>improvisation, modern classical, Greek, and klezmer sources. Combine<br/>this with Maneri&apos;s use of multiphonics, odd time signatures, 12-tone<br/>composition strategies, and atonal improvisation and you&apos;ve got a<br/>complete package like no other. Maneri&apos;s still at least 10 years ahead<br/>of his time.</p><p>Harvey Pekar</p></div>
