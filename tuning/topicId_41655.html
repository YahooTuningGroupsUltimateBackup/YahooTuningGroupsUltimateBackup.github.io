Webern<br/>&gt; was a musicologist who took up composing.</p><p>i have to assume that you&apos;re stretching the truth a bit<br/>to make a point.  it&apos;s documented quite well in Moldenhauer&apos;s<br/>big biography of Webern that he began composing in 1899<br/>at the age of 15, several years before he entered the<br/>University of Vienna and began his studies in musicology<br/>with Guido Adler.</p><p>-monz</p></div>
