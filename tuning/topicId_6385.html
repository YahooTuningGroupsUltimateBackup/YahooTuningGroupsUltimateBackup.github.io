I was trying to<br/>optimize the &quot;starling&quot; scale (the one based on major and minor thirds of<br/>388 and 312 cents that I described in a previous thread), and it occurred<br/>to me that there was another interval I could tweak, one that I hadn&apos;t even<br/>considered before: the octave. It turns out that making the octave 2 cents<br/>sharp (without affecting the thirds or the fifth) improves the augmented<br/>sixth, so that instead of 964 cents, it ends up as 966 cents, only 2.8<br/>cents flat! A slightly better result is achieved with a major third of<br/>388.3 cents and a minor third of 311.7 cents, which leaves the fifth the<br/>same (700 cents), but results in an augmented sixth of 966.9 cents (1.9<br/>cents flat). So the 2/1, 3/2, 5/4, and 7/4 are all within about 2 cents of<br/>being perfectly tuned!</p><p>Slightly stretched octaves can also be applied to meantone scales. A<br/>1/7-comma meantone sounds pretty good with the octave stretched by 1/7 of a<br/>comma. The D a fifth above G is only 2/7-comma flat, which makes for good<br/>ninth chords, but the D an octave lower is 3/7-comma flat, which is good as<br/>a meantone major second, the best of both worlds (the major third thus ends<br/>up being 1/7-comma sharp). The augmented sixth in this scale is 973.5<br/>cents, or about 4.6 cents sharp.<br/>--<br/>see my music page ---&gt;   +--&lt;<a href="http://www.io.com/~hmiller/music/music.html">http://www.io.com/~hmiller/music/music.html</a>&gt;--<br/>      Thryomanes        /&quot;If all Printers were determin&apos;d not to print any<br/>   (Herman Miller)     / thing till they were sure it would offend no body,<br/>   moc.oi @ rellimh &lt;-/  there would be very little printed.&quot; -Ben Franklin</p></div>
