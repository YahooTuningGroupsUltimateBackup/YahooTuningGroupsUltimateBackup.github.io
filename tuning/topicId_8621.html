I normally use as a microphone a sound level meter (Radio Shack or equivalent) to stabilize the input level.  It is not the microphone which would be unsteady but possibly the sound source.

For speaker testing, extreme accuracy is not necessary.<br/>But this could be a problem in piano tuning in the lower register where the fundamental is weak, so it&apos;s better to start in the middle and do an octave there and (assuming a scale with consistent tuning throughout the octaves) tune the rest as octave intervals by ear.<br/>Whether you are tuning to just intonation or a temperament, the counter will get you close but the final adjustment to either no beats or some beats will need to be done by ear.

It was generally used to tune the<br/>Moog modular synth the studio had and generally had no trouble getting the<br/>freq from a Moog oscillator. Of course, that is a pretty steady signal<br/>(though not as steady as one would have liked, especially while the Moog<br/>was warming up).</p><p>It&apos;s true that, with a real-world input like from a microphone, the counter<br/>would often &quot;cast around&quot; a bit, sometimes jumping to a harmonic, other<br/>times just oscillating randomly, especially if the signal wasn&apos;t very<br/>clean. The rate of this oscillation on this particular model could be<br/>controlled by a precision switch, which set the sample window and hence the<br/>precision of the frequency estimate to 100, 10, 1, or 0.1 hertz. If the<br/>signal wasn&apos;t steady enough to get a clear reading at a high precision, one<br/>could set this switch to, say, 10 hz and a pattern of where it was<br/>oscillating around might become apparent, allowing a reasonable frequency<br/>estimate, albeit a rough one, especially for low- and mid-range pitches.</p><p>Of course, the expected input impedence was not in the range for a<br/>microphone, so the mic would have to go through a preamp. I don&apos;t know if<br/>this is of any help, especially if you have to decide whether or not to<br/>spend $150 on something that might or might not work for your purposes.<br/>Best of luck.</p><p>Bill</p><p>^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^<br/>^ Bill Alves                                      email: <a href="mailto:alves@hmc.edu">alves@hmc.edu</a> ^<br/>^ Harvey Mudd College                 URL: <a href="http://www2.hmc.edu/~alves/">http://www2.hmc.edu/~alves/</a> ^<br/>^ 301 E.

One of the few pieces of test equipment available (on special order) is a signal generator which has a digital readout, to a tenth of a Hertz.   In kit form it is $199 or $200 and built up $269 or $270.<br/>I also neglected to mention my tuning methodology.  Rather than try to input the signal from an instrument, I set the generator to the desired frequency and tune the instrument to that, followed by fine tuning the instrument to itself (within an octave) and then the other octaves (such as on a piano) to the central one.  The microphone setup, with or without preamp (the sound level meter has one built in) is useful when testing loudspeakers and necessary because the signal generator dial calibrations are not very accurate on my Eico.</p><p>&gt;&gt;&gt; &quot;John F.
