The ability to modulate to keys with a different set of ratios. Why<br/>modulate if you are going to have the same ratios!<br/>2. The lack of ambiguity in intervals allow for more strongly defined<br/>discords. dissonance no longer has to be ambiguous.<br/>3. Allowing more types of scales with lesser notes.<br/>4. It acknowledges that the  inviolable<br/>physiological/talismanic myth of Equality is absent from nature and is<br/>undesirable for it homogeneous misunderstanding.<br/>5. Purity and Equality cannot be achieved due to material limitations and<br/>the both terms  should be dropped for good.<br/>-- Kraig Grady<br/>North American Embassy of Anaphoria Island<br/><a href="http://www.anaphoria.com">www.anaphoria.com</a></p></div><h3><a id=1983 href="#1983">ðŸ”—</a>D.
