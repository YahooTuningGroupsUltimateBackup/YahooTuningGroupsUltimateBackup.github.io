I think I could<br/>use that one right off!</p><p>I feel we are off to a good *START* here, but we really need more<br/>systematic and clearer notation of 72-tET fingerings, a la Bruno<br/>Bartolozzi... done out nicely and printed up on computer, etc.</p><p>That might be a good project for us and the AFMM sometime!</p><p>It would be a big project, though...  but probably a valuable one.</p><p>Especially since I&apos;m convinced that 72-tET is the future of music!</p><p>(Just kidding, any such grandiose statement by anybody should always<br/>be immediately debunked!)</p><p>Incidentally, your *own* fingering charts in _Pitch_ are the *model*<br/>of clarity... so I wish the other cats could have done them out like<br/>that...</p><p>Thanks for all the help!</p><p>JP</p></div>
