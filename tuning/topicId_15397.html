As someone oriented to medieval and Renaissance<br/>music, I may have an opposite tendency sometimes to approach him in<br/>terms of 14th-century concepts &lt;grin&gt;, which maybe by a certain law of<br/>averages may give more impartial observers some basis for a balanced<br/>view.</p><p>Here I would like to consider Zarlino&apos;s approach to three-voice<br/>sonorities, focusing on a concept I might term &quot;conversity&quot; rather<br/>than 18th-century inversion, and to show that his classification of<br/>saturated 5-limit sonorities as &quot;natural&quot; or &quot;artificial&quot;<br/>interestingly leads to a conclusion similar to that of a theory of<br/>inversional affinity, although Zarlino himself to my knowledge does<br/>not himself draw it, at least in Book 3 of the _Harmonic Institutions_<br/>(1558).</p><p>Jon Wild writes:</p><p>&gt; Speaking of major/minor and triads, it might be important to<br/>&gt; remember that Zarlino considered E-G-C, say, a *minor* sonority<br/>&gt; because it has a minor 3rd and 6th above the bass. There is still no<br/>&gt; recognition in Zarlino of inversional equivalence of triads. Lippius<br/>&gt; has been mentioned by Monz and Margo, and he&apos;s the guy to thank for<br/>&gt; that.</p><p>As one whose own viewpoint tends to be closer to Zarlino than to<br/>18th-century theory, I would certainly agree that the association of<br/>the minor third with the _minor_ sixth, and the major third with the<br/>_major_ sixth, is an important point on which the two approaches may<br/>differ.</p><p>From a dynamic viewpoint, both minor third and minor sixth are<br/>typically contractive intervals, as I call them, the minor third often<br/>resolving by stepwise contrary motion to the unison (m3-1), and the<br/>minor sixth by oblique motion to the fifth (m3-5).</p><p>In contrast, the major third and major sixth are expansive, typically<br/>progressing by stepwise contrary motion to fifth (M3-5) or octave<br/>(M6-8).</p><p>Affectively, as Zarlino points out, the major third and major sixth<br/>are &quot;bright&quot; and joyful, while the minor third and sixth alike are<br/>somewhat &quot;sad&quot; or &quot;languid.&quot;</p><p>These tendencies can also apply in various multi-voice sonorities and<br/>progressions. For example, using a MIDI-style notation where C4 is<br/>middle C:</p><p>G4 A4           A4  G#3<br/>D4 F4           D4  E4<br/>B3 C4           A3  B3<br/>G3 F3           F3  E3</p><p>(M3-5)       (M6-8 + M3-5)</p><p>Here both the G3-B3-D4-G4 and F3-A3-D4-A4 sonorities are &quot;expansive,&quot;<br/>featuring two-voice progressions to the &quot;nearest consonance&quot; of M3-5, and<br/>also M6-8 in the second example.</p><p>At the same time, however, in Zarlino&apos;s analysis the first sonority<br/>represents a &quot;natural&quot; arrangement of the consonances, and the second<br/>an &quot;artificial&quot; arrangement -- concepts which may roughly correlate<br/>with the 18th-century distinction between major and minor triads, or<br/>possibly the 20th-century distinction between otonal and utonal<br/>5-limit or higher sonorities.</p><p>In distinguishing between natural and artificial arrangements, Zarlino<br/>uses two criteria: the contrast between the harmonic and arithmetic<br/>divisions of an outer interval such as the fifth into major and minor<br/>third; and the ordering of intervals in a saturated 5-limit sonority<br/>as compared to that of the &quot;sonorous numbers.&quot;</p><p>First let us take a look at Zarlino&apos;s scheme of six basic varieties of<br/>three-voice sonorities, with the numbers next to each note showing<br/>string lengths:</p><p>------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>Interval set:    (5,M3,m3)          (M6,M3,4)          (m6,m3,4)<br/>------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p>                 | G3 10            | E4 12            | C4 15<br/>Natural          |     (m3)         |     (M3)         |     (4)<br/>arrangement    5 | E3 12         M6 | C4 15         m6 | G3 20<br/>                 |     (M3)         |     (4)          |     (m3)<br/>                 | C3 15            | G3 20            | E3 24</p><p>------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p>                 | A3 4             | D4 3             | C4 5<br/>Artificial       |     (M3)         |     (4)          |     (m3)<br/>arrangement    5 | F3 5          M6 | A3 4          m6 | G3 6<br/>                 |     (m3)         |     (M3)         |     (4)<br/>                 | D3 6             | F3 5             | E3 8</p><p>------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p>Gothic and Renaissance theory focuses on what I shall term<br/>_conversity_, the relationship between sonorities sharing the sets of<br/>_intervals_ differently arranged. In our table, this relationship<br/>obtains between the three vertically aligned pairs or columns of<br/>sonorities.</p><p>These pairs are the alternative arrangements or permutations of three<br/>basic types of sonorities discussed by Zarlino: a fifth divided into<br/>major and minor third (5,M3,m3); a major sixth divided into major<br/>third and fourth (M6,M3,4); and a minor sixth divided into minor third<br/>and fourth (m6,m3,4).</p><p>We may describe these paired arrangements compared by Zarlino as<br/>&quot;conversities,&quot; because their adjacent intervals are conversely<br/>ordered. Thus the natural arrangement of (5,M3,m3) has the major third<br/>below and the minor third above (e.g. C3-E3-G3), while the artificial<br/>arrangement conversely has the minor third below (e.g. D3-F3-A3).</p><p>The two horizontal rows of the table show the three &quot;natural&quot; or more<br/>harmonious arrangements of Zarlino, and the three &quot;artificial&quot; or less<br/>harmonious ones.</p><p>In order to illustrate an interesting property of this system which I<br/>am not sure whether Zarlino himself mentioned at any point in his<br/>writings, I have derived all three sonorities of a given row from the<br/>same set of pitch classes -- (C,E,G) for the upper or &quot;natural&quot; row<br/>and (D,F,A) for the lower or &quot;artificial&quot; row.</p><p>As this exercise shows, transposing the pitches of a Zarlinan natural<br/>sonorities will produce another natural sonority, e.g. C3-E3-G3,<br/>G3-C4-E4, E3-G3-C4. Similarly, transposing the pitches of an<br/>artificial sonority produces another artificial sonority,<br/>e.g. D3-F3-A3, F3-A3-D4, A3-D4-F4.</p><p>Thus we might speak of an &quot;inversional affinity&quot; between Zarlino&apos;s<br/>natural and artificial sonorities, while at the same time recognizing<br/>important dynamic and affective contrasts between these different<br/>interval sets. For example, both the natural C3-E3-G3 and the<br/>artificial F3-A3-D4 with their major thirds and sixths are expansive,<br/>while the natural E3-G3-C4 and the artificial A3-D4-F3 with their<br/>minor thirds and sixths are contractive.</p><p>How does Zarlino distinguish between natural and artificial<br/>arrangements? He uses two methods, the first of which I shall term the<br/>&quot;harmonic/arithmetic&quot; contrast, the other the &quot;senarial&quot; approach,<br/>from his _senarius_ or _senario_, the series of the first six natural<br/>integers or &quot;sonorous numbers&quot; used to define consonant ratios.</p><p>Especially for the interval set (5,M3,m3), Zarlino frequently uses the<br/>harmonic/arithmetic approach, based on string-ratios.</p><p>In the harmonic division of the fifth, the ideal form of _harmonia<br/>perfetta_ or complete 5-limit harmony, with the major third below and<br/>the minor third above, we have a string-ratio of 15:12:10, where the<br/>differences between the two two pairs of adjacent terms form a ratio<br/>identical to that between the two outer terms. Note that since we are<br/>dealing with string-ratios, the larger number represents the lower<br/>string and note:</p><p>3         :        2<br/>|------------------|<br/>C3       E3       G3<br/>15       12       10<br/>  (15-12)  (12-10)<br/>      3   :   2</p><p>In contrast, the &quot;artificial&quot; arrangement with the minor third below<br/>the major third, 6:5:4, has a less harmonious arithmetic division,<br/>with equal differences between adjacent terms:</p><p>3         :        2<br/>|------------------|<br/>D3       F3       A3<br/>6         5        4<br/>    (6-5)   (5-4)<br/>      1   :   1</p><p>We can also apply this approach to the set (M6,M3,4), where the more<br/>natural harmonic division, 20:15:12, has the fourth below the major<br/>third:</p><p>5         :        3<br/>|------------------|<br/>G3       C4       E4<br/>20       15       12<br/>  (20-15)  (15-12)<br/>     5    :   3</p><p>In contrast, the artificial arrangement with the major third below the<br/>fourth has the less harmonious arithmetic division 5:4:3 with its<br/>equal differences between adjacent terms:</p><p>5         :        3<br/>|------------------|<br/>F3       A3       D4<br/>5         4        3<br/>   (5-4)    (4-3)<br/>     1    :   1</p><p>With two arrangements of the set (m6,m3,4), however, this approach<br/>based on the harmonic/arithmetic contrast will not work, because<br/>neither 5-limit division of the 8:5 minor sixth -- 24:20:15 or 8:6:5<br/>-- is an harmonic or arithmetic division. To achieve such a division,<br/>we would need to go to the 13-limit, 104:80:65 (harmonic) or 16:13:10<br/>(arithmetic). Such ratios are beyond the scope of Zarlino&apos;s 5-limit<br/>system.</p><p>However, Zarlino uses another approach which can apply to all three<br/>interval sets, the criterion of the ordering of the &quot;sonorous<br/>numbers,&quot; an approach also used to compare voice-spacings.</p><p>In an ideally harmonious sonority, the vertical concords would be<br/>ordered in a series of ratios becoming more complex in ascending<br/>order. Here, again, numbers next to notes show string lengths:</p><p>      C5  15<br/>             8:5<br/>      G4  20<br/>             6:5<br/>      E4  24<br/>             5:4<br/>      C4  30<br/>             4:3<br/>      G3  40<br/>             3:2<br/>      C3  60<br/>             2:1<br/>      C2 120</p><p>The first five ascending intervals of the series follow the order 2:1,<br/>3:2, 4:3, 5:4, and 6:5 in a simple and elegant way; these are the<br/>basic consonances found within the senario itself (1,2,3,4,5,6). To<br/>account for the minor sixth at 8:5 (here E4-C5), however, it is<br/>necessary to add the term 8, not itself within the senario.</p><p>Using this ideal sonority based on &quot;the sonorous numbers,&quot; Zarlino<br/>finds that in a combination of minor sixth, minor third, and fourth,<br/>the minor third &quot;naturally&quot; occurs _below_ an adjacent fourth, here<br/>E4-G4-C5, i.e. 6:5 below 8:6.</p><p>In contrast, the major third (of M6,M3,4) occurs naturally _above_ an<br/>adjacent fourth, here G3-C4-E4, i.e. 5:4 above 4:3.</p><p>Applying this approach to (5,M3,m3), we find likewise that the major<br/>third occurs below the minor third, here C4-E4-G4, i.e. 5:4 below 6:5.</p><p>In short, Zarlino&apos;s &quot;natural&quot; and &quot;artificial&quot; divisions -- synonymous<br/>for (5,M3,m3) and (M6,M3,4) with the harmonic and arithmetic divisions<br/>-- are apparently analogous to the later concepts of major/minor or<br/>otonal/utonal 5-limit triads.</p><p>A full appreciation of Zarlino&apos;s system must include a recognition,<br/>for example, that F3-A3-D4 is at once an expansive sonority (M6-8,<br/>M3-5) and an artificial one.</p><p>Whether or not Zarlino ever noted it in his writings, the inversional<br/>affinity between the three natural divisions, and likewise between the<br/>three artificial divisions, is an interesting feature of his system.</p><p>&gt; It&apos;s also interesting that Zarlino can&apos;t escape the conclusion that<br/>&gt; the 6/4 chord 3:4:5 &quot;should&quot; be more consonant, according to his<br/>&gt; theory, than the 5/3 4:5:6 - just like Helmholtz, 300 years later. I<br/>&gt; can&apos;t quite remember how he squirms out of it - does anyone have it<br/>&gt; handy to check?</p><p>Actually I would say that he doesn&apos;t go this far, but does conclude in<br/>Chapter 60 of Book III that the &quot;natural&quot; C4-F4-A4, for example, with<br/>the fourth below and the major third above, is more harmonious than<br/>the converse arrangement of these intervals, e.g. C3-E3-A4. However,<br/>while finding the former arrangement &quot;good,&quot; he finds the minor third<br/>below the fourth &quot;better,&quot; e.g. A3-C4-F4. Both C4-F4-A4 and A3-C4-F4<br/>are natural divisions, but he finds the second more harmonious.</p><p>The conclusion that C4-F4-A4 is actually more harmonious than C3-E3-A3<br/>nicely fits his viewpoint that the 4:3 fourth is properly regarded as<br/>a perfect concord in the same category as the 3:2 fifth.</p><p>While recognizing that musicians (i.e. of the Renaissance tradition<br/>with which he is familiar) have treated the fourth with considerable<br/>caution, he urges that it reasonably might be treated more freely,<br/>with a sonority such as C4-F4-A4 serving as an example.</p><p>His point is that if an &quot;artificial&quot; arrangement like C3-E3-A3 is<br/>freely permitted as concordant, why not the &quot;natural&quot; arrangement with<br/>the fourth below and major third above.</p><p>Interestingly, to demonstrate the consonant nature of the fourth he<br/>relies not only on its mathematical simplicity, but also on a bit of<br/>ethnomusicology, pointing out that the Greeks of Venice use it above<br/>the bass in their part-songs, possibly referring to the Greek Orthodox<br/>liturgy.</p><p>If he had had available a copy of the Buxheim Organ Book from the<br/>middle to later 15th century, he might also have cited some examples<br/>possibly illustrating the use of Pythagorean schisma thirds and sixths<br/>in the epoch leading up to the introduction of meantone keyboard<br/>temperaments, say 1430-1450.</p><p>For example, some pieces in this collection feature phrases ending on<br/>prolonged noncadential sonorities like this one:</p><p>E4<br/>C#4<br/>A3<br/>E3</p><p>If we play this in a Pythagorean tuning where the written C#4 is<br/>realized as Db4, we get something only a schisma (32805:32768 or ~1.95<br/>cents) from a pure 3:4:5:6. This seems an example of a fourth above<br/>the bass being regarded as part of a euphonious tertian sonority,<br/>albeit an inconclusive one.</p><p>While Zarlino&apos;s view of the fourth as a perfect concord leads him to<br/>propose its freer or more consonant treatment in practice, he also<br/>proposes that parallel fourths should be avoided on the basis in<br/>Renaissance theory and practice as parallel fifths. He especially<br/>disapproves of what he calls _falsobordone_ in the sense of the<br/>traditional fauxbourdon with its chains of upper parallel fourths.</p><p>Vicentino (1555) likewise finds this idiom more tedious than &quot;sweet&quot;<br/>because of the similarity of the sonorities, although he<br/>characteristically is ready to permit it to express the affections of<br/>a text (properly tension rather than sweetness, in his view).</p><p>Lippius (1610, 1612) interestingly agrees with Zarlino about the<br/>fourth, classifying it as a perfect concord, and saying that musicians<br/>who regard it as a dissonance suffer from &quot;delirium.&quot;</p><p>&gt; Clearly, triadic harmonic entropy can&apos;t escape that either. Hence I<br/>&gt; invoke an additional concept, &quot;rootedness&quot;, which is justified<br/>&gt; partially by the masking phenomena in the ear which make the lowest<br/>&gt; note of each of these triads sound the loudest.</p><p>Might this tie in with Zarlino&apos;s opinion that C4-F4-A4 is &quot;good,&quot; but<br/>C3-E3-A4 is &quot;better&quot;?</p><p>Also, of course, Zarlino says that _harmonia perfetta_ normally<br/>consists of &quot;the third plus fifth,&quot; i.e. above the lowest note,<br/>although sometimes &quot;the sixth is used in place of the fifth,&quot; implying<br/>priority to the former kind of combination.</p><p>Most appreciatively,</p><p>Margo Schulter<br/><a href="mailto:mschulter@value.net">mschulter@value.net</a></p></div>
