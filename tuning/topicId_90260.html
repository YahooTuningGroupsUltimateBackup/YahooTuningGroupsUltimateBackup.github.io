While some decades ago it<br/>was feared that the Supersonic Transport (SST) might result in the<br/>depletion of Earth&apos;s ozone layer, our Ozan layer is no less vital to<br/>the well-being of the Tuning list, protecting us from unmitigated<br/>doses of &quot;ultraviolet radiation&quot; that might reduce our thriving<br/>ecosystem to a 24-EDO or 72-EDO monoculture.</p><p>The cause for our present problem, happily, is itself a great good:<br/>the super-sonic quality transport of Ethno2, inspiring a forthcoming<br/>demo from our worthy Ozan but also raising the issue of Ozan depletion<br/>if this same Ozan is asked to explain the limitations of equal<br/>temperaments even in the throes of preparing this demo.</p><p>Therefore, to help us weather this temporary Ozan depletion problem, I<br/>now step forward to explain a few things about 72-EDO and Yarman-79,<br/>albeit definitely in an &quot;unauthorized&quot; version, and with notes on my<br/>own strange tastes in maqam music and tunings for which he is yet more<br/>absolutely not responsible, if that were possible! Ozan&apos;s writings, of<br/>course, are the ideal &quot;authorized&quot; source, and I would be delighted if<br/>this article raises more interest in them &lt;<a href="http://www.ozanyarman.com/">http://www.ozanyarman.com/</a>&gt;.</p><p>Also, taking a break from my own process of exploring and<br/>understanding Dastgah-e Segah, I send warmest greetings to Jacques,<br/>and congratulations on the creative force which Ethno2 is proving.</p><p>Additionally, I&apos;d like to thank you, Cameron, for the best pretext I&apos;ve<br/>seen yet in favor of my regular temperament that gets 9/7 &quot;wrong&quot; by a<br/>tad more than 5 cents, albeit in the more interesting direction:<br/>actually I&apos;m getting 22/17 wrong by only 6.25 cents! As for my clever<br/>&quot;Peppermint&quot; idea, if I would only stick with Keenan Pepper&apos;s high<br/>concept and make it a regular 24-note chain, I&apos;d be only 0.395 cents<br/>off (so quoth Scala).</p><p>Now back to the Ozanosphere which is the main focus. Why use Yarman-79,<br/>basically an ingeniously tweaked MOS of 159-EDO, rather than 72-EDO,<br/>or 43-EDO for Persian music, or for that matter my favorite nonequal<br/>scheme of the moment (which doubtless can be virtually cloned by some<br/>EDO with enough steps to do so)?</p><p>Again, this is an _unauthorized_ version by a weird alien musician who<br/>shares with Ozan mainly the curious view that medieval and later Near<br/>Eastern theorists are worth reading, and that the practices of quotidian<br/>performers (an adjective Ozan has taught me to love!) are worth<br/>studying and indeed measuring scientifically where possible and<br/>appropriate.</p><p>First of all, to put things directly, Yarman-79 includes both pure<br/>fifths and a pathway for meantone through the &quot;Baroque&quot; fifths and<br/>fourths respectively about 1/3 Holdrian comma narrow and wide. He can<br/>thus have the steps or perdeler rast and segah about 380 cents apart,<br/>and connect them via a chain of four perfect fifths each impure by no<br/>more than 1/3 comma.</p><p>Just try this in 72-EDO! As Paul Erlich summed things up about a<br/>decade ago, it isn&apos;t a meantone, and Ozan wants some meantone<br/>capabilities. While 383.33 cents might be an acceptable distance<br/>between rast and segah for Ozan&apos;s purposes, there&apos;s no way to connect<br/>these two steps at this distance with a chain of four fifths where one<br/>isn&apos;t impure by 16.67 cents -- over twice the 1/3 Holdrian comma of<br/>Yarman-79.</p><p>I consider that pretty straightfoward, and I even quoted Paul Erlich,<br/>not to my knowledge a Near Eastern theorist!</p><p>How about a 53-note circulating Pythagorean tuning, or 53-EDO, both of<br/>which might claim Near Eastern precedents (although I&apos;m not sure I&apos;ve<br/>seen Pythagorean schemes beyond 24 notes, a Pythagorean-53 would be my<br/>own preference if going in this direction)?</p><p>Here the Ozanian literary canon -- and also his kanun -- supply two<br/>answers. The first is that 53-EDO, like 72-EDO, is not a meantone, and<br/>neither includes meantone capabilities. However, Yarman-79 has both<br/>many of the intervals of 53-EDO, plus that meantone option!</p><p>Also, with 53-EDO, we are limited to two sizes of middle or Zalzalian<br/>or neutral intervals -- call them what we will. With a Pythagorean 53,<br/>we get four sizes, since there will be some variations by the<br/>3.615-cent comma of Mercator, but still not the diversity of<br/>Yarman-79.</p><p>For an alien focusing on curious concepts of mostly Arab and Persian<br/>tuning, life can be a bit simpler: I often get by with middle seconds<br/>of 132 or 154 cents, and middle thirds of 341 and 363 cents, even<br/>observing that maybe 363 cents, a near-just 37/30 as it happens<br/>although structurally more like a tempered 121/98, &quot;isn&apos;t so far&quot; from<br/>the classic Turkish 26/21. In fact, at least one Syrian 24-note<br/>scheme, that of Tawfiq al-Sabbagh, likewise has two sizes of middle or<br/>Zalzalian intervals -- but again, a lot less diversity than Yarman-79!</p><p>Why not just tune 159-EDO, or an expertly tweaked variation to get<br/>some just fifths and fourths, as in Yarman-79? Here Ozan is seeking<br/>above all to choose a system that can actually be implemented on a<br/>practical qanun, as we know that Yarman-79 can.</p><p>Getting back to musical values as opposed to practical implementation<br/>limits with instruments of interest, Ozan is quite rightly a sticker<br/>for the right shade or flavor of intonation in a given maqam as<br/>interpreted in the Ottoman tradition! I know as someone at times at<br/>the receiving end of that discernment.</p><p>For example, I may think of 154-132-209 cents as a fine tetrachord for<br/>Maqam Huseyni: but Ozan will helpfully inform me that 165 cents for<br/>that lower middle step would be much more like it, as studies of<br/>Turkish performers have shown! While I may think of my quotidian<br/>tuning as fine for Arab music, or even invoke the steps of Ibn Sina&apos;s<br/>Mustaqim (9:8-13:12-128:117) as the basis for my very approximate<br/>permutation, Ozan and his colleagues can for their part cite actual<br/>Turkish practice! Of course, since I&apos;m going for a &quot;generic&quot; Huseyni<br/>rather than the specific tradition that Ozan knows and embraces, there&apos;s<br/>no conflict in these views, and we would likely find various shades of<br/>tuning in different parts of the Near East.</p><p>Actually I have found an attractive (for me) tuning that would do much<br/>more justice for an Osmanli Huseyni (i.e. an Ottoman Huseyni,  if I&apos;m<br/>correct) at 161-127-208 cents, which actually satisfies one of George<br/>Secor&apos;s criteria (at least if read literally, which here is to say<br/>generously) for a &quot;near-just&quot; temperament -- Peppermint doesn&apos;t quite<br/>meet the test, but does support 159-129-208, a better Turkish Huseyni<br/>than 154-132-209.</p><p>In the new temperament I&apos;m looking at, actually a spinoff of a recent<br/>thread about EDO&apos;s, the middle steps would be 127-138-151-161 cents,<br/>more variety than 132-154 cents but not the total kind of variety that<br/>Ozan needs. Indeed, he needn&apos;t spend one second showing why this<br/>scheme is no substitute for Yarman-79 when he could be more usefully<br/>preparing his Ethno2 demo or listening to some classic sharki as a<br/>welcome diversion!</p><p>For one, any 24-note tuning I use for maqam music is likely either<br/>_not_ to be a meantone (or putting it another way, much more<br/>17-EDO-like than meantone-like), or to be something like Zest-24 with<br/>171-cent steps not so ideal for a maqam style (yes, Ozan does mention<br/>32:29 in his writings, but not as an ideal middle second!).</p><p>For Ozan&apos;s views and explanations, his own writings are the best<br/>source, not to speak of his own music on his 79-tone kanun or<br/>otherwise.</p><p>That&apos;s a partial response until our Ozan gets undepleted.</p><p>With many thanks,</p><p>Margo Schulter<br/>mschulter@...</p></div><h3><a id=90262 href="#90262">ðŸ”—</a>Carl Lumma &#x3C;carl@...&#x3E;</h3><span>6/11/2010 8:46:39 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, Margo Schulter &lt;mschulter@...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Hello, all.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; In recent days, the Tuning list has confronted the unpleasant<br/>&gt; phenomenon of atmospheric Ozan depletion.</p><p>LOL! :)  Thanks, Margo.  -Carl</p></div><h3><a id=90265 href="#90265">ðŸ”—</a>genewardsmith &#x3C;genewardsmith@...&#x3E;</h3><span>6/11/2010 10:04:24 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, Margo Schulter &lt;mschulter@...&gt; wrote:</p><p>&gt; First of all, to put things directly, Yarman-79 includes both pure<br/>&gt; fifths and a pathway for meantone through the &quot;Baroque&quot; fifths and<br/>&gt; fourths respectively about 1/3 Holdrian comma narrow and wide.

Why use Yarman-79,<br/>&gt; basically an ingeniously tweaked MOS of 159-EDO, rather than 72-EDO,<br/>&gt; or 43-EDO for Persian music, or for that matter my favorite nonequal<br/>&gt; scheme of the moment (which doubtless can be virtually cloned by some<br/>&gt; EDO with enough steps to do so)?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Again, this is an _unauthorized_ version by a weird alien musician who<br/>&gt; shares with Ozan mainly the curious view that medieval and later Near<br/>&gt; Eastern theorists are worth reading, and that the practices of quotidian<br/>&gt; performers (an adjective Ozan has taught me to love!) are worth<br/>&gt; studying and indeed measuring scientifically where possible and<br/>&gt; appropriate.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; First of all, to put things directly, Yarman-79 includes both pure<br/>&gt; fifths and a pathway for meantone through the &quot;Baroque&quot; fifths and<br/>&gt; fourths respectively about 1/3 Holdrian comma narrow and wide. He can<br/>&gt; thus have the steps or perdeler rast and segah about 380 cents apart,<br/>&gt; and connect them via a chain of four perfect fifths each impure by no<br/>&gt; more than 1/3 comma.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Just try this in 72-EDO! As Paul Erlich summed things up about a<br/>&gt; decade ago, it isn&apos;t a meantone, and Ozan wants some meantone<br/>&gt; capabilities. While 383.33 cents might be an acceptable distance<br/>&gt; between rast and segah for Ozan&apos;s purposes, there&apos;s no way to connect<br/>&gt; these two steps at this distance with a chain of four fifths where one<br/>&gt; isn&apos;t impure by 16.67 cents -- over twice the 1/3 Holdrian comma of<br/>&gt; Yarman-79.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I consider that pretty straightfoward, and I even quoted Paul Erlich,<br/>&gt; not to my knowledge a Near Eastern theorist!<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; How about a 53-note circulating Pythagorean tuning, or 53-EDO, both of<br/>&gt; which might claim Near Eastern precedents (although I&apos;m not sure I&apos;ve<br/>&gt; seen Pythagorean schemes beyond 24 notes, a Pythagorean-53 would be my<br/>&gt; own preference if going in this direction)?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Here the Ozanian literary canon -- and also his kanun -- supply two<br/>&gt; answers. The first is that 53-EDO, like 72-EDO, is not a meantone, and<br/>&gt; neither includes meantone capabilities. However, Yarman-79 has both<br/>&gt; many of the intervals of 53-EDO, plus that meantone option!<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Also, with 53-EDO, we are limited to two sizes of middle or Zalzalian<br/>&gt; or neutral intervals -- call them what we will. With a Pythagorean 53,<br/>&gt; we get four sizes, since there will be some variations by the<br/>&gt; 3.615-cent comma of Mercator, but still not the diversity of<br/>&gt; Yarman-79.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; For an alien focusing on curious concepts of mostly Arab and Persian<br/>&gt; tuning, life can be a bit simpler: I often get by with middle seconds<br/>&gt; of 132 or 154 cents, and middle thirds of 341 and 363 cents, even<br/>&gt; observing that maybe 363 cents, a near-just 37/30 as it happens<br/>&gt; although structurally more like a tempered 121/98, &quot;isn&apos;t so far&quot; from<br/>&gt; the classic Turkish 26/21. In fact, at least one Syrian 24-note<br/>&gt; scheme, that of Tawfiq al-Sabbagh, likewise has two sizes of middle or<br/>&gt; Zalzalian intervals -- but again, a lot less diversity than Yarman-79!<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Why not just tune 159-EDO, or an expertly tweaked variation to get<br/>&gt; some just fifths and fourths, as in Yarman-79? Here Ozan is seeking<br/>&gt; above all to choose a system that can actually be implemented on a<br/>&gt; practical qanun, as we know that Yarman-79 can.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Getting back to musical values as opposed to practical implementation<br/>&gt; limits with instruments of interest, Ozan is quite rightly a sticker<br/>&gt; for the right shade or flavor of intonation in a given maqam as<br/>&gt; interpreted in the Ottoman tradition! I know as someone at times at<br/>&gt; the receiving end of that discernment.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; For example, I may think of 154-132-209 cents as a fine tetrachord for<br/>&gt; Maqam Huseyni: but Ozan will helpfully inform me that 165 cents for<br/>&gt; that lower middle step would be much more like it, as studies of<br/>&gt; Turkish performers have shown! While I may think of my quotidian<br/>&gt; tuning as fine for Arab music, or even invoke the steps of Ibn Sina&apos;s<br/>&gt; Mustaqim (9:8-13:12-128:117) as the basis for my very approximate<br/>&gt; permutation, Ozan and his colleagues can for their part cite actual<br/>&gt; Turkish practice! Of course, since I&apos;m going for a &quot;generic&quot; Huseyni<br/>&gt; rather than the specific tradition that Ozan knows and embraces, there&apos;s<br/>&gt; no conflict in these views, and we would likely find various shades of<br/>&gt; tuning in different parts of the Near East.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Actually I have found an attractive (for me) tuning that would do much<br/>&gt; more justice for an Osmanli Huseyni (i.e. an Ottoman Huseyni,  if I&apos;m<br/>&gt; correct) at 161-127-208 cents, which actually satisfies one of George<br/>&gt; Secor&apos;s criteria (at least if read literally, which here is to say<br/>&gt; generously) for a &quot;near-just&quot; temperament -- Peppermint doesn&apos;t quite<br/>&gt; meet the test, but does support 159-129-208, a better Turkish Huseyni<br/>&gt; than 154-132-209.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; In the new temperament I&apos;m looking at, actually a spinoff of a recent<br/>&gt; thread about EDO&apos;s, the middle steps would be 127-138-151-161 cents,<br/>&gt; more variety than 132-154 cents but not the total kind of variety that<br/>&gt; Ozan needs. Indeed, he needn&apos;t spend one second showing why this<br/>&gt; scheme is no substitute for Yarman-79 when he could be more usefully<br/>&gt; preparing his Ethno2 demo or listening to some classic sharki as a<br/>&gt; welcome diversion!<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; For one, any 24-note tuning I use for maqam music is likely either<br/>&gt; _not_ to be a meantone (or putting it another way, much more<br/>&gt; 17-EDO-like than meantone-like), or to be something like Zest-24 with<br/>&gt; 171-cent steps not so ideal for a maqam style (yes, Ozan does mention<br/>&gt; 32:29 in his writings, but not as an ideal middle second!).<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; For Ozan&apos;s views and explanations, his own writings are the best<br/>&gt; source, not to speak of his own music on his 79-tone kanun or<br/>&gt; otherwise.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; That&apos;s a partial response until our Ozan gets undepleted.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; With many thanks,<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Margo Schulter<br/>&gt; mschulter@...<br/>&gt;</p></div><h3><a id=90376 href="#90376">ðŸ”—</a>Margo Schulter &#x3C;mschulter@...&#x3E;</h3><span>6/14/2010 7:06:07 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>&gt;  22/17 also puns with a 6/5 from 14/13 and with 5/4 from 28/27, ie,<br/>&gt;  you could use 84/65 at about 444 cents. So, in a tuning based on<br/>&gt;  interlocking tetrachords, you could get a very nice reordered<br/>&gt;  chromatic tetrahord from 28/27 above the tonic of the first<br/>&gt;  tetrachord (provided there&apos;s a 28/27 above the next conjunct<br/>&gt;  tetrachord), for example.</p><p>Hi, Cameron. Another ratio close to 22/17 is 128/99 at about 445<br/>cents, which comes up in Zephyr-24, a superset of the 1-3-7-9-11-13<br/>eikosany.</p><p>One context where an interval around 9/7 or 128/99 often comes up --<br/>with 352/273 at 440 cents a &quot;tempering&quot; of either I often seem to use<br/>as either a rational ratio or very close irrational approximation --<br/>is in what I call Huzam Jadid or &quot;New Huzam,&quot; meaning that the larger<br/>and smaller neutral steps are reversed from their usual placement<br/>based on Rast:</p><p>         Sikah Jadid    Zirkula      Mustaqim<br/>        |----------|---------------|---------|<br/>        C*    D    E    F     G*   A    B    C*<br/>        0    154  363  440   705  859  1068 1200<br/>          154   209  77   264  154   209  132</p><p>This is one of the maqamat in the Sikah family, with a Sikah trichord,<br/>middle Hijaz tetrachord (here a variant known as &quot;Zirkula&quot; with the<br/>middle step around 7/6 but the semitone around 22/21 first and the<br/>largish neutral second around 12/11 last), and a trichord of Rast,<br/>or here Mustaqim (with a tone plus a smaller neutral second, rather<br/>than the larger one typical of Rast), to fill out the &quot;textbook&quot; octave version.

These two<br/>intervals in a given system, if it&apos;s strictly regular (a 23-fifth<br/>chain), will differ by the 17-comma, which represents 64/63 or 78/77<br/>or 99/98, etc.</p><p>&gt;  Even higher in the region between 13/10 and 17/13 is the most<br/>&gt;  multifacted interval of them all for harmony, the number one<br/>&gt;  &quot;shadow interval&quot;, but a big pain to integrate into a tetrachordal<br/>&gt;  structure, being so close to 4/3.</p><p>One trick I&apos;ve had pointed out to me is that 13/5 can have a very<br/>special quality because of the octave spacing, in my experience making<br/>a very nice wide major tenth expanding to a 12th while a comparably<br/>wide major sixth expands to an octave. Keenan Pepper&apos;s regular tuning<br/>has a near-just 17/13 along with the 22/17.
