Schulter &#x3C;MSCHULTER@VALUE.NET&#x3E;</h3><span>12/25/2001 8:00:01 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Hello, there Paul and Pierre and everyone.</p><p>Please let me thank you both for your beautiful graphics, and comment<br/>briefly both on your &quot;pelog-style pentatonic&quot; diagram with intervals<br/>show as just ratios and in 36-tET, Pierre; and on your diagrams, Paul,<br/>of harmonic entropy curves in margo2.gif and margo3.gif.</p><p>First, I&apos;d like to emphasize that in describing my just pentatonic as<br/>a &quot;pelog-style&quot; tuning, I was following my own very general or<br/>&quot;categorical&quot; concept of pelog as &quot;a pentatonic scale with semitones<br/>and major thirds,&quot; something that might also apply to similar Japanese<br/>scales. On looking at the Scala archives, and encountering Harrison&apos;s<br/>near-identical tuning, I went with the Scala label, &quot;pelog-style<br/>pentatonic.&quot;</p><p>However, before complimenting you, Pierre, on your beautiful diagram,<br/>I should agree with an important point you make, Paul, and which could<br/>apply to many &quot;adaptations&quot; or &quot;variations&quot; on traditional tuning<br/>systems of various cultures.</p><p>While I can&apos;t speak for Harrison or others who have taken the gamelan<br/>form and adapted it to a range of intonational systems and cultural<br/>settings, I can confirm that my quick survey of the Scala archives<br/>indeed revealed no Javanese or Balinese pelog that I could find with<br/>semitones narrower than 100 cents. I might consider something like 133<br/>cents in 9-tET, or 36-tET for that matter, more typical.</p><p>Thus my own outlook, really shaped by a bit of listening to<br/>traditional gamelan and Japanese music around the early 1970&apos;s, was<br/>quite generic: &quot;How about a &grave;semitone/major third&apos; kind of pentatonic<br/>with ratios like 28:27, 7:6, and 9:7?&quot; I&apos;m not sure if Harrison took<br/>the same kind of path, but that&apos;s how I got there.</p><p>Here I had some generic impression of a style of melody, which could<br/>be applied to various kinds of intonational fabrics within certain<br/>bounds of categorical perception. For example, I can take either 63<br/>cents or 133 cents as a &quot;semitone,&quot; and either 267 cents or 331 cents<br/>as a kind of &quot;minor third&quot; or the like.</p><p>These categorical impressions may say at least as much about my own<br/>cultural and musical background as about traditional gamelan or<br/>Japanese intonation in what I call &quot;semitone/major third&quot; scales.</p><p>In contrast, Paul, you took the tradition of 22 srutis as followed in<br/>the raga system of India, and related it to 22-tET or a 22-note<br/>well-temperament for decatonic music. This should not be taken to draw<br/>an equation between the 22-sruti system as practiced in India and your<br/>style of decatonic and tetradic tonality.</p><p>Just as you would not attribute a style based on stable 4:5:6:7<br/>tetrads to the Indian tradition, so I would not wish to imply that<br/>progressions by contrary motion from 7:9:12 to 2:3:4, which my<br/>&quot;pelog-style&quot; scale happens to support on the second degree, are<br/>practiced in the Javanese or Balinese tradition.</p><p>Also, when I describe &quot;Phrygian-like&quot; or &quot;Lydian-like&quot; modes in my<br/>scale, I am taking a medieval or Renaissance European perspective on<br/>the melodic qualities of these modes (associated with larger diatonic<br/>heptatonic sets), rather than a traditional pelog-oriented view (where<br/>the full tuning actually has seven notes, as I understand, with five<br/>of them forming what I hear as a &quot;pentatonic scale&quot;).</p><p>Anyway, Pierre, I love your diagram: the different geometric shapes<br/>showing what I might read as different modes for the just intervals,<br/>and also the very engaging graphic of the 36-tET steps. Joe Pehrson,<br/>if you&apos;re reading this, I&apos;d say that this is one type of tuning where<br/>36-tET gives a superb approximation, and along with the just tuning<br/>and a couple of other tempered ones it&apos;s among my favorites.</p><p>Paul, while I might not have noted all the fine points distinguishing<br/>margo2.gif from margo3.gif, maybe from a certain artistic point of<br/>view these graphics reflect two different musical outlooks as well as<br/>mathematical models.</p><p>In margo2.gif, the peaks and valleys look more nuanced or &quot;gentle,&quot;<br/>with major and minor valleys more similarly proportioned; in<br/>margo3.gif, a number of ratios are dramatically &quot;deeper&quot; in their<br/>valleys than others.</p><p>Maybe I tend to lean more to the first approach, especially in a<br/>neo-Gothic setting, approaching a bit nearer the second in a typical<br/>Renaissance style in a harmonic timbre where meantone is the<br/>historical norm.</p><p>Could it be that since the primary concords in neo-Gothic tend to be<br/>1:1, 3:2, and 2:1 -- with 4:3 as the complement of 3:2 -- almost<br/>everything else can be &quot;nuanced&quot; or &quot;negotiable.&quot; Yes, I know you<br/>might reply that evidently in 13-tET, 3:2 and 4:3 can also be<br/>&quot;nuanced&quot; considerably &lt;grin&gt; -- although here the timbre might result<br/>in a different curve, something interesting to study on the basis of<br/>the actual timbres I use for this temperament.</p><p>Anyway, as a very friendly holiday present, I&apos;d say that your diagrams<br/>do show a lot of empathy for the way I tend to view things. However<br/>they might reflect the likeliest models of harmonic entropy, which I<br/>understand is an approach yet being developed, they might serve as a<br/>most congenial map for my vision of the continuum.</p><p>Thank you both for your artistry, sharing of ideas, and generosity in<br/>such a season among such a community.</p><p>Most appreciatively, with seasons tidings to all,</p><p>Margo Schulter<br/><a href="mailto:mschulter@value.net">mschulter@value.net</a></p></div><h3><a id=32110 href="#32110">ðŸ”—</a>jpehrson2 &#x3C;jpehrson@rcn.com&#x3E;</h3><span>12/29/2001 11:48:00 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In tuning@y..., &quot;M.
