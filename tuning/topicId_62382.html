So far only the music by Prent Rodgers has suited my taste and I&apos;m<br/>now trying to find out if someone else has also been working with these or<br/>similar things. I like using harmonic series portions as chords very much<br/>because I love hearing common fundamentals. That&apos;s why I&apos;m also interested<br/>in things like Partch diamonds or linear frequency shifting. When I was<br/>writing my &quot;parizek_epi2a.scl&quot; about three years ago, I had right these<br/>chords in my mind. - Now to those of you who like similar things about JI as<br/>I do. If there&apos;s someone among you who has only little experience in<br/>non-electronic ways of approximating JI, I can say: Don&apos;t be afraid to try<br/>everything you think is worth it. About a week ago, I decided to extend my<br/>intonation research even further. I took my old-fashioned 4-track tape<br/>recorder and tried to do seven short chords to test my singing abilities.<br/>The top tone of all of them was the same and they all were certain parts of<br/>the harmonic series and therefore the fundamentals came out as a part of the<br/>subharmonic series then. What I&apos;ve found out is that it&apos;s possible to sing<br/>almost everything. If I wanted to sing each voice just as it is without<br/>having notion of the other ones, I surely couldn&apos;t sing small intervals<br/>(like 15 cents or so) convincingly. Indeed, finally, though the voices were<br/>detuned a bit, I was able to clearly hear the fundamentals!</p><p>Thanks for any ideas.</p><p>Petr</p><p>PS: What I&apos;m also trying to find is some recordings of music using larger<br/>meantone chains than 12 notes, no matter if it&apos;s 16th or 20th century.</p></div><h3><a id=62383 href="#62383">ðŸ”—</a>Gene Ward Smith &#x3C;gwsmith@svpal.org&#x3E;</h3><span>11/15/2005 2:30:44 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, Petr Pa&oslash;&iacute;zek &lt;p.parizek@c...&gt; wrote:</p><p>&gt; PS: What I&apos;m also trying to find is some recordings of music using<br/>larger<br/>&gt; meantone chains than 12 notes, no matter if it&apos;s 16th or 20th century.</p><p>You might try these:</p><p><a href="http://66.98.148.43/~xenharmo/mmm.htm">http://66.98.148.43/~xenharmo/mmm.htm</a></p><p><a href="http://66.98.148.43/~xenharmo/wagmean.htm">http://66.98.148.43/~xenharmo/wagmean.htm</a></p></div><h3><a id=62403 href="#62403">ðŸ”—</a>Yahya Abdal-Aziz &#x3C;yahya@melbpc.org.au&#x3E;</h3><span>11/16/2005 5:27:40 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>On Tue, 15 Nov 2005, Petr Pa&iuml;&iquest;&half;&iuml;&iquest;&half;zek wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Hi all.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I&apos;m trying to find links to some downloadable music which uses primarily<br/>JI<br/>&gt; scales, in the best case often containing large parts of the harmonic<br/>&gt; series.
