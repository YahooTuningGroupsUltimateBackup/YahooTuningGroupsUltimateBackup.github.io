So the scale they are playing<br/>is the ideal scale consisting of<br/>mathematical points in the continuum.</p><p>Similarly vibrato would be<br/>thought of as vibrato around the intended<br/>ideal pitch.</p><p>However, if the player is deliberately<br/>bending the notes around, maybe with<br/>pitch glissandi too, and also intends them<br/>to be understood as still the &quot;same scale degree&quot; then they are playing<br/>fuzzy pitches centred on whatever<br/>they are taking as the central pitches<br/>for each note (if any).</p><p>Of course one could use a scale with<br/>fuzzy pitches as a way to analyse<br/>the playing after the event too,<br/>which is another thing.</p><p>Anyway either way of understanding it,<br/>your conditino 2) says that the fuzzy<br/>reals can&apos;t overlap. But I&apos;d want<br/>to say that they can. I can understand<br/>the reason - because you want to<br/>get back from a point in the real line<br/>to the scale degree it belongs to.<br/>But you can do that even with<br/>overlaps if it is possible to use<br/>the harmonic and melodic context<br/>to disambiguate the ambiguous<br/>pitches.</p><p>As for 3), if by discrete you mean<br/>that all the points in the scale<br/>should be isolated points<br/>(the way it is usually understood)<br/>- so that there are gaps of<br/>finite size about each point with<br/>no neighbours in them - then<br/>that would rule out everywhere<br/>dense scales such as the Lambdoma.</p><p>I&apos;d want to say that 3) picks out a particular subset of all possible scales.<br/>Though I can understand why som ewould<br/>be particularly interested in those<br/>subsets. Similarly with the Lambdoma<br/>one can choose to focus on a particular<br/>finite subset of the infinite lambdoma.<br/>In that case the infinite scale is a gamut from which one would normally<br/>choose a finite (so discrete) subset to play<br/>in. But one could write a piece which traversed<br/>a dense scale endlessly in some way, and even<br/>though it would in practice never<br/>cover more than a small finite region of the<br/>scale, it would be.</p><p>On the distinction between tuning and<br/>tuning-math - I think it is a matter<br/>of the presentation rather than the<br/>topic. Suggestion for guidelines about where<br/>a post belongs:</p><p>If something presented mainly in ordinary<br/>language with as few as possible<br/>mathematcial words and any unfamiliar<br/>words explained, then if no-one objects<br/>to it then I think it is reasaonable<br/>to post it here. If it involves symbols<br/>and mathematical terms that would typically<br/>be encountered first at first year<br/>undergraduate level or later, and with no<br/>explanation or attempt to express<br/>them in ordinary language, it belongs<br/>on tuning-math.</p><p>But if anyone objects to it as too mathematical despite maybe several attempts to<br/>make it accessible, then one again it belongs on<br/>tuning-math because obviously it then<br/>isn&apos;t as accessible as one thought<br/>it was. Or if they just say - please<br/>go away basically, then rather than<br/>attempt to explain again, it is polite<br/>to just go over to tuning-math even if one doesn&apos;t quite<br/>understand why they are saying that<br/>about the particular topic<br/>and presentation.</p><p>Thanks,</p><p>Robert</p></div><h3>Robert Walker &#x3C;robertwalker@ntlworld.com&#x3E;</h3><span>5/21/2005 5:41:49 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Hi Gene,</p><p>Getting confused by using a kind of everyday language<br/>notion of discrete here.</p><p>&gt; I&apos;d want to say that it is okay to think<br/>of them as discrete and one doesn&apos;t<br/>have to think of them as fuzzy</p><p>Perhaps points for &quot;discrete&quot; there:</p><p>I&apos;d want to say that it is okay to think<br/>of them as points, and one doesn&apos;t<br/>have to think of them as fuzzy</p><p>because in some infinite scales they<br/>won&apos;t actually be discrete, in the sense<br/>of all points being isolated from neighbours if<br/>you use a large enough scale of magnification<br/>to see the gaps - but still as ideal scale<br/>pitches they can be treated as single<br/>points all of them.</p><p>Robert</p></div><h3>Yahya Abdal-Aziz &#x3C;yahya@melbpc.org.au&#x3E;</h3><span>5/22/2005 9:37:13 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Robert and Gene,</p><p>I agree with Robert that we need not take this<br/>discussion away from tuning, providing we only<br/>use the simplest mathematical ideas, pretty much<br/>as Robert wrote.</p><p>However, if a workable definition of a scale<br/>inherently involves more difficult maths - and I<br/>would sincerely hope that it doesn&apos;t - then let&apos;s<br/>explore that on tuning-math, and see what we can<br/>bring back here of more general use.</p><p>Regards,<br/>Yahya</p><p>--<br/>No virus found in this outgoing message.<br/>Checked by AVG Anti-Virus.<br/>Version: 7.0.322 / Virus Database: 266.11.15 - Release Date: 22/5/05</p></div>
