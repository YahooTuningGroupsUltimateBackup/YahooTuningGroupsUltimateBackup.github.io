I assume that most of us are<br/>not interested in these capacities.</p><p>Chinese music theory has indeed associated particular affects with<br/>particular pitches. However, the fixed reference pitch for Chinese music<br/>(&quot;the yellow bell&quot;) has changed dramatically at several points in time, yet<br/>the associations remained affixed in theory to the same tone names. Thus the<br/>affects cannot have been frequency dependent, and must either be (a)<br/>associated rather with intervals (which makes little sense given the minimal<br/>intervallic variety of the tuning system), (b) associated with fixed<br/>figurations or ornaments (which is somewhat true in Karnaktic music, but<br/>does not seem to apply to the received repertoires of Chinese music), or (c)<br/>false.</p><p>I would advise taking great caution with the work of Danielou.  He was<br/>basically a UNESCO bureaucrat with an strong orientalist viewpoint, more<br/>interested in telling his informants what he thought they were doing than<br/>actually listening to them and getting informed.  His ethics as a collector<br/>and producer of recorded musics were highly questionable, in the line of<br/>&quot;handing out biscuits to the natives&quot; in return for recording their<br/>performances, and his liner notes are often laughably wrong.</p><p>&gt;    And: &quot;Western readers should be warned against making any hasty<br/>&gt; judgements about the practical value of the correspondences attributed<br/>&gt; to musical notes by the Chinese or Indians. These attributions are by no<br/>&gt; means arbitrary and are perfectly in accordance with the inevitable<br/>&gt; significance of musical intervals, although they often refer to certain<br/>&gt; kinds of correspondences that we are not accustomed to consider.&quot; These<br/>&gt; are ideas and concepts worthy of a lot of study and reflection, I<br/>&gt; believe....Hstick</p></div>
