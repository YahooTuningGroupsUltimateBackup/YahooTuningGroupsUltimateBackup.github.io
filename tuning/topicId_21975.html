For this piece, Ed has chosen the<br/>DeMorgan temperament, a kind of reverse well temperament.  It&apos;s easy to<br/>see right away that this is a good choice for consonant intervals: the<br/>piece moves between C# minor and C# major (Db major?  I don&apos;t have a<br/>score), many fifths away from C major.  Again, I thought it might be fun<br/>to see what tuning might be implied by the intervals contained in the<br/>piece itself.</p><p>As always, my analysis presupposes that intervals (major and minor<br/>thirds, fourths, and inversions) should best be as close to Just as<br/>possible.  This supposition might be contrary to the original composer&apos;s<br/>practice, and certainly, wishes.</p><p>I don&apos;t have the complete numbers on the DeMorgan temperament.  Ed&apos;s<br/>very nice graph shows major thirds, and these can&apos;t be mapped back to<br/>the circle of fifths, because there are four independent rings of three<br/>major thirds each.</p><p>I found the ideal fixed tuning deviations in cents from 12-tET to be<br/>(note: 0 == C, 1 == C#/Db, etc.):</p><p>EA 24 43  (For pitch  9, we have bend  10.2563)<br/>E4 5D 44  (For pitch  4, we have bend  14.7708)<br/>EC 4D 43  (For pitch 11, we have bend  11.2585)<br/>E6 5A 40  (For pitch  6, we have bend   2.2069)<br/>E1 28 40  (For pitch  1, we have bend   0.9876)<br/>E8 67 40  (For pitch  8, we have bend   2.5318)<br/>E3 65 40  (For pitch  3, we have bend   2.4739)<br/>EB 4B 3E  (For pitch 10, we have bend  -4.4407)<br/>E5 6F 3C  (For pitch  5, we have bend  -9.8065)<br/>E0 3B 3D  (For pitch  0, we have bend  -7.9490)<br/>E7 21 3D  (For pitch  7, we have bend  -8.5817)<br/>E2 4F 3B  (For pitch  2, we have bend -13.7080)</p><p>It looks like a crazy meantone, Bbb through D, or A through C##.</p><p>I found the major thirds to be distributed as follows (note the Strength<br/>column):</p><p>Ptch Tuning Ptch Tuning Strength    Ideal   Actual      Force       Pain<br/>---- ------ ---- ------ -------- -------- -------- ---------- ----------<br/> 0   -7.95   4   14.77    17.984  396.485  422.720    471.810   6188.845<br/> 7   -8.58  11   11.26     2.680  409.470  419.840     27.796    144.132<br/> 2  -13.71   6    2.21     6.018  386.316  415.915    178.141   2636.398<br/> 9   10.26   1    0.99   260.604  386.398  390.731   1129.332   2446.990<br/> 4   14.77   8    2.53   436.938  386.371  387.761    607.175    421.869<br/>11   11.26   3    2.47    80.399  386.514  391.215    377.968    888.442<br/> 6    2.21  10   -4.44   141.774  386.625  393.352    953.778   3208.252<br/> 1    0.99   5   -9.81   413.161  386.493  389.206   1121.072   1520.960<br/> 8    2.53   0   -7.95   325.603  386.974  389.519    828.684   1054.532<br/> 3    2.47   7   -8.58    50.153  386.660  388.944    114.581    130.888<br/>10   -4.44   2  -13.71    53.976  386.530  390.733    226.867    476.772<br/> 5   -9.81   9   10.26    39.900  386.716  420.063   1330.546  22184.770</p><p>The most represented thirds are E-G# (from C# minor) and C#-E# (from C#<br/>major).
