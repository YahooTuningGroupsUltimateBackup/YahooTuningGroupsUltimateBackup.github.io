In proposing<br/>&gt; the same regular temperament as a counterpart of Kornerup&apos;s Golden<br/>&gt; Meantone (where the same ratio obtains between the large diatonic and<br/>&gt; small chromatic semitone), Keenan Pepper was evidently proceeding by<br/>&gt; way of an appealing mathematical intuition rather than a calculated<br/>&gt; optimization for a given musical style.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;</p><p>-- -Kraig Grady<br/>North American Embassy of Anaphoria Island<br/> <a href="http://www.anaphoria.com">http://www.anaphoria.com</a><br/>The Wandering Medicine Show<br/> KXLU 88.9 FM 8-9PM PST</p></div>
