We just took a bit of a hit with the<br/>&quot;is Lucy-Tuning really original and good?!&quot; issue and I would like to<br/>at least take a shot at trying to cool this all off.</p><p>   This is paraphrased from another thread message:<br/>&quot;I am simply asking for him to demonstrate how his PHI scale does all<br/>the wonderful things he says it does.&quot;<br/>   And, this is coming from the same person who asked me for a copy of<br/>it and said he&apos;d love to have the .scl file for it so he could try it.<br/>********************</p><p>   Now in my case interactions have been fairly positive in a number<br/>of cases (including the above).  But in other cases (IE Charles Lucy&apos;s<br/>and my case trying to say 24TET can be used as an every-man&apos;s<br/>extension to 12TET)...it hasn&apos;t been very positive at all for the most<br/>part and borderline on very harsh stereotyping and saying what<br/>is/isn&apos;t wrong with my personality rather than focusing on the scales.<br/>  In the latter case especially, it feels like I have to be either<br/>labeled &quot;the pompous renegade who thinks he has all the answers&quot; or<br/>&quot;the guy following our rules politely but therefore doing nothing<br/>truly original&quot;.</p><p>  I think Charles and I, for example, are in danger of being thrown<br/>into the &quot;pompous renegade&quot; bin not because we think our work is<br/>perfect, but because we can&apos;t explain our non-standard tunings in<br/>standard terms.  So (for example) some of his chords (or mine) may not<br/>convert to 12TET equivalents?  That wasn&apos;t the point we (or at least<br/>I) intended anyhow...<br/>******************************</p><p>   Here it goes.  Some of us know Doctorate-level math.  I for one<br/>certainly don&apos;t.<br/>  Most of my scales are generated from fractions and algebraic<br/>patterns and occasionally a tad of calculus...not scale matrices,<br/>tonality diamonds, or anything like that.  Nothing more than<br/>high-school math for the most part.<br/>---------------------------<br/>   And yet, sometimes people 100% demand I (and virtually anyone who<br/>presents their own non-pure-JI scale on here) use scale math to<br/>explain how my scale works BEFORE they admit it sounds decent (if not<br/>good).  Often I will even send sound samples of a scale and people<br/>will react &quot;sounds good to my ears, but if you can&apos;t explain how it<br/>works, you are a liar for saying it does&quot;.</p><p>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>   It all seems to go back to a philosophy of &quot;something new MUST be<br/>tied to something old (and somewhat famous) in order to be GOOD&quot;.<br/>&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;</p><p>   Don&apos;t get me wrong, I find it very useful when someone with a<br/>better hand at math and/or scale history than myself can explain to me<br/>why something I&apos;ve made works and find errors.</p><p>  Heck, the ideas for establishing a tonal center in my tunings,<br/>enabling transposition, using a circle of notes/intervals to form a<br/>scale, creating periodicity buzz instead of beating...ALL came from<br/>people on this list.  No I don&apos;t think I know everything...in fact;<br/>there&apos;s no way I could make the scales I have and do make without your<br/>help.  And I&apos;m still listening and learning.  I don&apos;t think Charles is<br/>that much (or perhaps any) different in why he&apos;s here; and certainly<br/>such a small avant-garde group is not a place to spend time market the<br/>heck out of a scale.</p><p>  But it becomes a real bear is when people try to actually change the<br/>theories or workings of my scales in order to make it fit some ancient<br/>model they had in mind.<br/>-----------------------------<br/>   Back to the actual scales:<br/>   Lucy-Tuning, to me, is &quot;just&quot; a chromatic tuning with purer<br/>intervals that (unlike diatonic JI), allows transposition and<br/>modulation.  No, it&apos;s not perfect (nothing really is), but yes, it&apos;s a<br/>definite improvement.  I&apos;d give 12TET an 82%, and Lucy Tuning more<br/>like an 87%; it&apos;s a B+ tuning in my book and seems to create many<br/>12TET chords well making it a good &quot;transition to micro-tonal&quot; type of<br/>tuning that can still fool many people into thinking it is 12TET yet<br/>sound notice-ably clearer in the case of certain chords (no more<br/>deadly 13+ cent out of tune intervals like in 12TET).</p><p>*****************************<br/>   As for my scale (and even listening to the examples I&apos;m convinced<br/>you can tell)...you can fit about 8-9 notes per 2/1 octave and still<br/>have a melodic and harmonic feel about as stable (if not more so) than<br/>in 12TET.</p><p>  Yes, it does use PHI as the &quot;octave&quot; instead of 2/1...yes, most<br/>(though not all) combinations of notes will produce clear chords, yes,<br/>it&apos;s transpose-able and allows modulations.  No, it doesn&apos;t contain<br/>100% perfect intervals, no, there&apos;s not an easy way to map 12TET songs<br/>into it and still have them sound &quot;normal&quot;...it&apos;s a completely<br/>different beast.  And, no, I can&apos;t explain everything it does<br/>mathematically...I can try but, largely, the scale is a result of my<br/>cherry-picking (by ear) the best parts of the PHI tuning I could find.<br/>***************************************</p><p>  And if someone can explain it in a mathematical matrix/symmetry<br/>model or break down the beating patterns into a whole-number-ratio<br/>explanation without changing how the scale works to make it fit...great.</p><p>   But, to make it clear again...I&apos;m hoping people realize that making<br/>scales and tunings which sound good and are accessible to and flexible<br/>for musicians...is ultimately much more important than being forced to<br/>explain it in Doctorate-level scale math.  Rather, Doctorate-level<br/>explanations would be a sweet cherry on the top...but certainly don&apos;t<br/>have to be the foundation for a good sounding scale.<br/>***********************</p><p>  So if a scale sounds good...it need not be crushed just because it<br/>does not meet or can not be explained in someone&apos;s favorite<br/>mathematical terms.</p><p>-Michael</p></div><h3><a id=80994 href="#80994">ðŸ”—</a>chrisvaisvil@...</h3><span>2/12/2009 11:06:32 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Mike if you want me to try your gold scale a scala file would be most useful. Right now my daughter is very time consuming and my music isn&apos;t something I want to work hard at now.
