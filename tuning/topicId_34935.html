I believe 28 is doubly (or quadruply)<br/>&gt; negative. What is interesting from a notational standpoint is<br/>&gt; that the chain of fifths closes at 7-equal, resulting in<br/>&gt; # = b = 0.  (i.e., C = C# = Cx etc...)<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; So I said, &quot;hey, I&apos;ll just PRETEND that # = -b = 2&quot; and then<br/>&gt; fill the remaining blanks with arrows&quot;.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; C C^ C# Dv D D^ D# Ev E E^ E# Fv F etc...<br/>&gt;      Db         Eb         Fb<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; This seems like such a practical notation for 28, preserves<br/>&gt; 12 identities (C# = Db, Cx = D, except at E-F and B-C) and<br/>&gt; probably has nothing to do with any commas.</p><p>It&apos;s fine except maybe someone&apos;s gonna wonder why B:F# and Bb:F aren&apos;t the<br/>same as the other &quot;perfect fifths&quot;.

One where<br/>you take the &quot;perfect fifth&quot; to be 4/7 oct (686 c) as you have done, and<br/>the other where you notate it as every 3rd step of 84-tET (whose P5 happens<br/>to be the 12-tET perfect fifth since 7*12=84).

The<br/>&quot;major third&quot; (4*P5) in 28 is flat of the &quot;best 5/4&quot; as we are in an extremely<br/>negative universe.</p><p>I like this one. My mistake was forgetting that #=b=0 is a very important<br/>identity.</p><p>Now, if I want to figure out what the marks mean, based on a nifty spreadsheet<br/>I picked up which gives me a hint that 28 is {1,3,5,15,19} consistent,</p><p>I would say that &gt; = 20:19 (conflated with 25:24)<br/>                 ] = 76:75</p><p>The really good chain-crossing identity is that 3 steps = 16:15, is preserved<br/>in these choices.</p><p>&gt;<br/>&gt; The second notation looks like this:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; D D} Ebv Eb&gt; E&lt; E^ F{ F F} F#v F#&gt; G&lt; G^ G#{ G# Ab} Av A&gt; Bb&lt; Bb^ B{ B B}<br/>&gt; Cv C&gt; C#&lt; C#^ D{ D<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Now an approx 1:5:3 chord is spelled e.g. F:Av:Cv which tells the truth<br/>&gt; about the fifth really being quite narrow.</p><p>The whole set looks awful, but the chord does match what a 12et-er would<br/>perhaps be able to comprehend &quot;A is pinched down, heck I&apos;ll tune it to<br/>a just third, C is pinched down too, I&apos;ll do it the same as the A&quot;.</p><p>&gt;<br/>&gt; In this notation, A to G, # and b agree with 12-tET, and the other<br/>&gt; accidentals can be read as:<br/>&gt; v^ 14 cents<br/>&gt; &lt;&gt; 29 cents<br/>&gt; {} 43 cents<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; You can also use [] enharmonics for correct spelling of approx ratios of 11.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; [] 57 cents</p><p>Have to think about this.
