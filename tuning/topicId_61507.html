Are all these beat rates referring to the beating of upper<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; partials in a not-quite-JI chord?<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; For example, if I play an A major triad on my piano with the<br/>&gt; &gt; A tuned to 220 Hz, the C# to 275 Hz and the E tuned to 331 Hz,<br/>&gt; &gt; then I&apos;ll get beats between the 3rd partial of the A at 660 Hz<br/>&gt; &gt; and the 2nd partial of the E at 662 Hz.  These beats will be at<br/>&gt; &gt; 662 - 660 = 2 Hz.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Hi Yahya,<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I&apos;ll make a few comments.  If you want to wait for Paul&apos;s reply<br/>&gt; to reply, that&apos;s fine by me.  I&apos;m just thinking aloud waiting<br/>&gt; for Paul&apos;s reply myself.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I&apos;m not sure why you&apos;re subtracting these beat rates here.</p><p>Look again.  I subtracted two near partials to find a slow<br/>audible beat.  I did not subtract a beat from anything.</p><p>When ANY two frequencies sound simultaneously, so do two<br/>other frequencies - their sum and difference.  Since we only<br/>use the term &quot;beats&quot; to refer to low frequencies, I&apos;ve<br/>focussed on the difference of two tones that lie close to each<br/>other.  It&apos;s what I listen for when tuning a guitar.</p><p>&gt; As I think Paul was trying to say, beats are amplitude<br/>&gt; modulation, which is sort of a second order sound wave.</p><p>Combining two pure sinusoidal waves of frequencies A and B<br/>results in sinusoidal waves with components of frequencies<br/>A-B and A+B.  IIRC, these components are *multiplied*<br/>rather than *added*, so one (the slower) can be regarded<br/>as an (amplitude) envelope for the other (the faster).</p><p>&gt; They represent changes in the amplitude of a sound,</p><p>... which our ears respond to ...</p><p>&gt; ... not<br/>&gt; a sound in and of themselves.</p><p>I&apos;m not sure that this is so.</p><p>&gt; ... AM is used for synthesis<br/>&gt; and can create new pitches, called sidebands, but they<br/>&gt; aren&apos;t at the frequency of the beats.</p><p>Sure?
