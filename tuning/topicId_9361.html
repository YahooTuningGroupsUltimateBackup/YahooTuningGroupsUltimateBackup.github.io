Green.<br/>His specialty is voicing and tuning expensive recorders.  Initially, I<br/>wrote him to ask what historical tuning or tunings his recorders are<br/>available in, or whether the customer could specify to some extent.  He<br/>replied that he ships all recorders tuned (nominally) to 12t-ET.  When I<br/>asked what issues lay behind voicing and tuning of historical wind<br/>instruments, he gave four points, some of which seem somewhat<br/>compelling.  However, he declined to continue the discussion past that<br/>point due to his busy schedule.</p><p>I&apos;d be interested in getting some responses to his comments, and in any<br/>information about how wind instruments, and especially block flute or<br/>fipple-blown types, were tuned in late medieval to early Renaissance<br/>times.  Please remember that I do not represent the following point of<br/>view, I&apos;m merely passing on the words of someone who is responsible for<br/>tuning a significant percentage of the wind instruments currently in use<br/>by &quot;early music&quot; ensembles.  I find points 1 and 4 to be the most<br/>interesting and compelling, though not totally convincing. That said,<br/>here are Mr. Green&apos;s reasons for using 12t-ET on historical wind<br/>instruments.  I should warn you to be ready to breathe deeply and count<br/>to 10 after reading point 3 ;-)</p><p>[BEGIN QUOTE]<br/>        1. Wind and string instruments are played out of tune, both<br/>intentionally and unintentionally, by both amateur and accomplished<br/>professional musicians over a far wider degree of latitude, measured<br/>quantitatively, than that encompassed by any known historical or modern<br/>temperaments. Playing in tune, therefore, is a far bigger issue and far<br/>more important and critical than playing in any specific temperament per</p><p>se. The differences in temperaments, although real and palpable when<br/>heard in isolation and out of context, are in fact rather small and<br/>minor when compared to what actually transpires in musical performance.</p><p>        2. As I trust you already appreciate, there is no one perfect<br/>temperament, either universally or in relation to a specific historical<br/>period and body of music. All temperaments have their problems and their</p><p>&quot;dirty little secrets.&quot; These problems cannot be avoided, so the options</p><p>are simply a matter of putting the problems where they do the least<br/>amount of audible damage. To maintain that any one temperament is<br/>superior or inferior to another is purely nonsensical.</p><p>        3. I learned some 25 years ago that keyboard instruments (organs<br/>or<br/>harpsichords) do not have any more &quot;resonance&quot; when tuned in an<br/>historical temperament than in ET; all writings that maintain this is<br/>true are utter nonsense. The only factor that seems to have any real as<br/>opposed to theoretical impact on resonance is that the octaves on the<br/>instrument be exactly in tune with each other. One again, in the real<br/>world, being in tune is far more important than being in a specific<br/>temperament.</p><p>        4. If you take the most extreme &quot;sharp&quot; temperaments (wide major</p><p>thirds, sixths, and sevenths in relation to ET), such as Pythagorean,<br/>and the most extreme &quot;flat&quot; temperaments (narrow major thirds, sixths,<br/>and sevenths in relation to ET), such as quarter-comma mean tone, and<br/>average them together (add them up and divide by two, as it were) you<br/>will come out with a temperament which is rather close to equal<br/>temperament. In other words, all issues of historicity, convenience, and</p><p>tonal democracy aside for the moment, ET is a middle of the ballpark<br/>temperament, one which in fact has considerable merit both theoretically</p><p>and practically. Its additional advantage of equally distributing tuning</p><p>problems was, I suspect, historically just a byproduct. ET seems to have</p><p>evolved de facto and its mathematical calculation and theoretical basis<br/>were simply justification after the fact.</p><p>        This has a number of interesting ramifications: if one tunes a<br/>wind<br/>instrument to equal temperament, its various notes are most easily blown</p><p>up or down to meet the tuning of a keyboard instrument set in an<br/>historical temperament or a vocal or instrumental ensemble using a de<br/>facto just intonation or so-called &quot;romantic&quot; or tendential intonation;<br/>i.e., it is a very useful point of departure for making real as opposed<br/>to theoretical music.<br/>[END QUOTE]</p><p>Lock and load.</p><p>--<br/>David J.

Why you would want to do that is beyond me. Maybe it explains<br/>Yamaha plastic recorders being in ET, but the expensive recorders are<br/>designed with many parameters being different for the different historical<br/>periods. Medieval, Renaissance, transitional, baroque, bore shape and<br/>voicein gstandards are quite different.There would be no reason to make a<br/>baroque recorder that played in Pythagorean, for instance.</p><p>I bought a couple of the recorders that I play with my amateur consort<br/>from David Green. They work well, and for that group hoping for something<br/>better than ET is not realistic. But the really professional recorders I<br/>own were not built to play in ET, if you want equally tempered thirds in<br/>some keys on say my g-ganassi, you have to over-blow or refinger. The<br/>effort requires to lip up the mean-tone thirds on a cornett to ET heights<br/>is even more substantial.</p><p>The fact that original instruments from the early baroque, when played,<br/>tend to give much lower leading tones than ET, is an important part of the<br/>sound  the composers had in mind.

A wind instrument maker strives to makes the notes play as<br/>consistently as possible over the different registers, but I believe<br/>that all keyless wind instruments have what are essentially &quot;compromise&quot;<br/>tunings.

While visiting a 76-year old gentleman<br/>recently, I made him a cup of freshly ground Columbian coffee.  He liked the<br/>taste, but remarked that it wasn&apos;t any different form the Maxwell House that<br/>he has always used.  Though I drank Maxwell House early on, I have never<br/>returned after I realized I could taste fantastic coffee worthy of J.S.<br/>Bach&apos;s &quot;Coffee Cantata.&quot;</p><p>In the same way that I can &quot;taste&quot; the difference and he could not, I can<br/>hear the distinctiveness of different tunings while many moderns do not, can<br/>not, or will not.<br/>The great majority simply have not.</p><p>Harpsichords will never be heard as more resonant if the instrument&apos;s timbre<br/>mitigates against it.  In my experience, harpsichordists always revel in the<br/>myriad of colors possible through Werckmeister&apos;s chromatic tuning (III), or<br/>the purity of just intervals in quarter-comma meantone, or the idiosyncracies<br/>of the other tuning arrays.</p><p>As for recorders, I use adhesive tape to adjust any instrument from 12TET to<br/>any temperament, even Yamaha plastics (for others, of course).  It is the<br/>very historical usage that eases the instruments into tunings across the<br/>gamut.  And of course, there are a myriad of different fingerings on a<br/>recorder, beyond the conventional.  Actually, even in 12TET there are subtly<br/>different fingerings from one instrument to another (particularly the open G<br/>on the alto).</p><p>On my instruments (von Huene Standby Junior at A=440, and a Dolmetch<br/>original), there are no notes that cannot be reliably achieved, just as with<br/>the bassoon (Puchner model).</p><p>The big issue for recorder makers is that one can close up holes, but they<br/>cannot enlarge them easily.  Hence, making meantone recorders ghettoizes them<br/>from the 12TET context, and economically less viable.  Historic period<br/>recorders, which adjusted tuning with bees wax, had their tone holes<br/>increased in order to play hegemonic 12TET.  Analyses of tone holes on the<br/>instruments at the Metropolitan Museum of Art&apos;s instrument collection<br/>demonstrated how the instruments had their tone hones increased.</p><p>Johnny Reinhard<br/>AFMM</p></div>
