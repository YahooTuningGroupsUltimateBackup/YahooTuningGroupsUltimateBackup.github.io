As I<br/>recently proved, the actual optimal tuning according to this criterion is<br/>7/26-comma meantone. 31-tone is closer than 19-tone to this value, and<br/>despite the simplicity of 19-tone, I would definitely choose 31-tone if I<br/>had to choose one, since the possibilities of expanding beyond diatonicity<br/>in a musically meaningful way (including 7-limit and 11-limit harmony and<br/>Arabic scales) seem far more promising in 31-tone than in 19-tone.</p></div>
