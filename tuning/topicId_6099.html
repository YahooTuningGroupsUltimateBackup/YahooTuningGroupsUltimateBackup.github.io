My ear demands<br/>everything, Bach included, in 7-limit tuning.  There, a tritone is<br/>something to be tuned, either as 7/5 or as 10/7, according to context.<br/>In 5-limit, as I am slowly learning, a tritone is something to be<br/>subject to creative fudging, along with creative rationalizations about<br/>why it should be dissonant, yet we should still call this &quot;Just<br/>Intonation&quot;.</p><p>To reach an understanding of the beauty of 7-limit dynamic tuning, it is<br/>necessary to get past an intolerance for shifts of sub-comma and perhaps<br/>even an occasional super-comma step.  I am here to say that it IS<br/>possible to stretch one&apos;s ear&apos;s tolerance, and that the tradeoffs are<br/>well worth it, with a beauty that 5-limit falls far short of.</p><p>I would gladly leave 5-limit adaptive tuning to someone else, since I<br/>never listen to 5-limit unless there&apos;s some non-musical reason to do so.<br/>In fact, I have often considered withdrawing the 5-limit versions of<br/>the pieces I tune, if for no other reason than because I generate them<br/>and post them without hearing them.</p><p>However, some people still like 5-limit tuning, for whatever reason,<br/>and it is fun to dabble in pleasing other people&apos;s taste.  And, as for<br/>leaving 5-limit tuning to others, so far no one has stepped up to the<br/>plate with more than the barest vaporware.</p><p>For all the lack of programs to choose from, we seem to have no shortage<br/>of those who consider themselves &quot;experts&quot; in the field, whether or not<br/>they&apos;ve written a line of code or actually tuned a single sequence.</p><p>[JdL, TD 406.8:]<br/>&gt;&gt;So I don&apos;t think that an intermediate meantone representation adds<br/>&gt;&gt;anything useful to the tuning process.</p><p>[Paul Erlich, TD 406.9:]<br/>&gt;Think again.</p><p>Would you believe that, with no modification whatever to my executable,<br/>but with a new set of tuning files, I can achieve essentially the same<br/>close motion?

Possibly because of<br/>the accent on the linear he might have heard that these inversions are better<br/>for keeping an independence of voices. Something to keep in mind. Also in<br/>looking at some late 16th century polyphony (Burgundian mainly) I noticed that<br/>these type of inversion many times would precede the &quot;bars&quot; leading to a<br/>cadence.

I think it also inflamed me a bit that you just wrote<br/>&quot;meantone adds nothing&quot; when I&apos;ve spent quite a bit of time (remember the<br/>exchange with &quot;Brett Barbaro&quot;?) showing what it &quot;adds&quot;. My &quot;pet theory&quot; on<br/>this issue can almost certainly be given some sort of mathematical proof<br/>(given certain assumptions I thought we shared but it&apos;s turned out we<br/>probably don&apos;t), and perhaps my &quot;trumpetings&quot; have been poorly-worded<br/>attempts to outline this proof. Basically, I&apos;m claiming that in order to<br/>decide the best way to tune the triads of a piece relative to one another,<br/>given that you&apos;re going to tune them in JI within themselves, the first step<br/>should be to decide on the optimal fixed-pitch (though not necessarily only<br/>12-pitch) rendition of the piece, in terms of approximation to JI. The<br/>reason that is true is that then the adjustments leading to the tuning of<br/>the triads in JI will result in the smallest possible melodic shifts and<br/>will also never cause any drift. Now deciding the optimal fixed-pitch<br/>rendition of a piece involves optimizing the tuning of each note with<br/>respect to all the consonant harmonic relations it encounters over the<br/>course of the piece. In the case of most music from the Renaissance,<br/>Baroque, and Classical eras, those consonant relations involve, in nearly<br/>equal measure, all occurences of one, three, or four steps along the chain<br/>of fifths as conventionally notated. Optimizing the tuning of each note in<br/>this context leads to meantone temperament, as some of us were discussing<br/>when I was using Brett Barbaro&apos;s e-mail. For example, minimizing the maximum<br/>error relative to JI leads to 1/4-comma meantone temperament. Since the<br/>triads are then within 6 cents of JI, the final retuning will not involve<br/>any shifts of more than 6 cents.</p><p>&gt;It seems very strange for you to claim you&apos;re not surprised that I could<br/>&gt;pull out new tuning files and achieve close motion in the Bach; I invite<br/>&gt;you to re-read your posts of late in which, to my eyes at least, you<br/>&gt;had concluded without doubt that my method ensures three times the<br/>&gt;motion of yours.</p><p>I was thinking back to the exchanges we had when I was posting from Brett<br/>Barbaro&apos;s e-mail and you were using centered shifts from 12-tET as the basis<br/>of your algorithm. You then explained that your program was now doing<br/>something totally different, after which I don&apos;t think I made any such<br/>claims. Your new method still seems to involve slightly larger shifts than<br/>necessary for the Bach. I&apos;m very happy with how the opening progression of<br/>the Chaconne sounds in your latest version, but . . .</p><p>&gt;this<br/>&gt;latest 5-limit Bach tuning, which Paul E. thinks his ear might finally<br/>&gt;begin to accept (in brief passages, at least), sounds really stale and<br/>&gt;dull to me, much worse than the more bouncy 5-limit version I posted<br/>&gt;before</p><p>. . . indicates that perhaps your ears are craving something else, something<br/>quite different than minimizing melodic shifts.</p><p>&gt;But I do,<br/>&gt;I very much do, listen to 5-limit music, for one reason or another, and<br/>&gt;every time I do I long for seven again.</p><p>By &quot;5-limit music&quot; are you speaking of these MIDI files -- the same ones<br/>that you prefer in 7-limit tuning? Do you believe that the connection<br/>between composition and tuning only flows in one direction? Is it not<br/>possible (as Margo has been suggesting) that there are different<br/>compositional practices that have been developed that are appropriate to<br/>different tunings, and that bringing out the structural logic, and hence the<br/>beauty, of a given composition could depend in some way on performing it in<br/>a tuning that befits these aspects? Or does any given composition tuned one<br/>way qualify as &quot;5-limit music&quot; and tuned another way qualify as &quot;7-limit<br/>music&quot;?</p><p>You may know that my main interest in microtonal music was to find a way to<br/>really create _essentially_ &quot;7-limit music&quot;, with logical cohesiveness equal<br/>to that of common-practice &quot;5-limit music&quot;. In my opinion, taking<br/>common-practice works and tuning certain chords with ratios of 7 falls very<br/>short of that goal. What I found was that 10-tone scales in something very<br/>close to 22-tone equal temperament are to 7-limit what a diatonic scale in<br/>meantone temperament is to 5-limit. Hence one of the main reasons I&apos;m<br/>interested in adaptive JI is ultimately as a way to allow music written in<br/>22-tET to be performed with greater consonance in the 7-limit harmonies,<br/>without sacrificing the melodic integrity of the 10-tone scales.</p><p>&gt;I have a nightmare fantasy of sharing some low-level source code with<br/>&gt;you, to help you put your ideas into practice, only to find that, in<br/>&gt;return, you want to dissect every last aspect of my design decisions and<br/>&gt;brag about how much better you would have done it.</p><p>John, at this point it is quite clear that we have very different aesthetic<br/>goals, and we hear Bach very differently. At least one person, Ken Wauchope,<br/>has made aesthetic remarks that lead me to believe that maybe he hears Bach<br/>much the way I do. So perhaps there are others who do as well. If my ideas<br/>lead to renditions of Bach that sound really nice to me and at least a few<br/>other people, I will have accomplished my goal. It would be very generous of<br/>you to offer to help in this regard. What practical relevance low-level<br/>design decisions have to do with the sound of the music, I can&apos;t imagine.</p><p>John, again I&apos;m sorry and I&apos;ll try to keep Mr. Hyde under control!</p></div><h3><a id=6481 href="#6481">ðŸ”—</a>John A. deLaubenfels &#x3C;jadl@xxxxxx.xxxx&#x3E;</h3><span>12/1/1999 10:41:24 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Paul, thanks for your response!

Paul, when you asked for a detailed breakdown of<br/>the opening bars of the Bach piece, and I looked and found 16 cents<br/>movement between successive notes, I knew that this motion could be<br/>seized upon for criticism.  I briefly considered blowing you off, to<br/>avoid trouble, but decided to post the results and let the chips fall<br/>where they may.  I did feel that you were a bit gleeful in response, and<br/>that you made unfair comparisons between my approach and yours.  BUT,<br/>let me acknowledge that any &quot;guilt&quot; is far from one-sided!  For example,</p><p>[Paul Erlich, TD 413.7:]<br/>&gt; I think it also inflamed me a bit that you just wrote &quot;meantone adds<br/>&gt; nothing&quot; .</p><p>Mea culpa!  Actually, your meantone approach clearly WILL result in<br/>nice tight tuning motion, and it certainly quashes drift, as long as the<br/>sequence doesn&apos;t introduce microtone shifts (still an open question in<br/>my mind).</p><p>You note that my tuning emphasis<br/>&gt; . . . indicates that perhaps your ears are craving something else,<br/>&gt; something quite different than minimizing melodic shifts.</p><p>Yes!  In fact, I am coming to realize that I actually WANT some shifting<br/>going on, to chase away a staleness (to my ears) in the sound.  Mainly,<br/>though, I want to hear chords well tuned, even brief ones, even if it<br/>means doing some sub-commatic shifts.  Setting these criteria makes<br/>shifts inevitable to one degree or another.</p><p>As far as the question of melodic influence to tuning, which several<br/>list members have touched upon, I DO recognize that, for the best in<br/>dynamic tuning, this should be considered, and it&apos;s NOT in my present<br/>method.  Still, I think it is incorrect to say, as you did in TD 405.5:</p><p>&gt;I would say that you must first learn to analyze a piece of music in<br/>&gt;these terms before you can effectively offer improvements in its<br/>&gt;tuning.</p><p>Now that really torqued me off, I have to admit.  If, as we all seem<br/>to agree, 12-tET is not at any kind of tuning optimum, then could it not<br/>be shown that ANY slight shift away from 12-tET would be an improvement<br/>in one direction and a worsening in the other?  Even if that assertion<br/>is off the wall, I think it&apos;s unjust to make a blanket statement along<br/>the lines of &quot;it is necessary to consider everything to get anything<br/>effective.&quot;</p><p>BTW, I think that your ear&apos;s taste, favoring small motion over<br/>well-tuned tritones, would be shared by many on this list and elsewhere,<br/>probably with far greater representation than my own taste; so far, only<br/>about 2.5 other people on the list have shown wild enthusiasm for the<br/>tunings I like best (the 1/2 is for someone who sometimes likes 7,<br/>sometimes 5, sometimes something else).  I say this to second your<br/>thought that your work might be appreciated!</p><p>(Of course I&apos;d be thrilled if the world beat a path to my 7-limit<br/>tuning examples, but I&apos;ll settle for pleasing myself).</p><p>I will prepare some C++ source code that you might find helpful to<br/>handle low-level chores: with it, you can read a midi file, hold and<br/>manipulate the sequence in a linked list, and then write it back out<br/>as a new midi file.  The only things I&apos;m going to strip out from my<br/>current working program are a few of the routines unique to my method,<br/>which are still in great flux, and about which I still feel proprietary<br/>ownership.</p><p>I will ask that you use this for non-commercial work, and that you refer<br/>others who might want it to me rather than passing it along yourself.<br/>This specific message is directed to Paul E., but other programmers are<br/>welcome to the same source - just ask!  Give me about a week to get it<br/>ready.</p><p>Do you have a PGP key?  I prefer to send source encrypted, on general<br/>principle, and to piss off the gov&apos;t as an added bonus! (they think they<br/>should be able to read all our e-mail at will, the #$%&amp;*@!  Oops, there<br/>I go again!!).</p><p>Enough for now!

The just-noticeable-difference for<br/>melodic pitches is at least 8 cents, so there should be no need for audible<br/>shifts (other than your desire for a lack of staleness).</p><p>&gt;&gt;I would say that you must first learn to analyze a piece of music in<br/>&gt;&gt;these terms before you can effectively offer improvements in its<br/>&gt;&gt;tuning.</p><p>&gt;Now that really torqued me off, I have to admit.

Bach carefully _notated_ all his music as if it were in<br/>meantone but used 12-tone well-temperament in practice because he did not<br/>have (or want) more than 12 keys on his instruments. Handel, by the way,<br/>used an organ that was equipped to play extended meantone with 16 pitches,<br/>so that he could choose G# or Ab, D# or Eb, C# or Db, depending on the key<br/>of the music. Bach was, in a sense, the last composer in the great Western<br/>polyphonic tradition; by the end of his life his style was considered quite<br/>antiquated. Although the transcendence of his music relative to that of his<br/>time (with Handel perhaps coming in a distant second) was ultimately<br/>appreciated, it is still the case that his _language_ (including notation)<br/>was derived from a meantone-oriented practice that began about 200 years<br/>before his birth. In that sense, he was as steeped in meantone as we today<br/>are in 12-tET.</p><p>Secondly, as Ivor Darreg pointed out, melodic and harmonic judgements are<br/>often in direct conflict as to their influence on tuning. So any slight<br/>shift from the norm in a particular direction might be an improvement<br/>melodically but not harmonically, or vice versa. I&apos;m not sure whether that<br/>agrees or disagrees with you were trying to say above, or what any of this<br/>has to do with the main point.</p><p>The main point: it is useful to discover how the musical establishment<br/>understands the music of one of its great heroes before one proceeds to try<br/>to &quot;improve&quot; it. Although one should never simply accept the standard<br/>academic ideology, in this case it&apos;s been shaped by hundreds of years of<br/>artistic/pedagogical work on a single body of evidence (the notated music<br/>itself), and represents a point of view that should at least be understood<br/>before it is modified or dismissed entirely. Looking over a book such as<br/>Forte&apos;s _Tonal Harmony in Concept and Practice_ should give you a fair idea<br/>of the major elements of this point of view in a reasonable period of time,<br/>and represents the distillation of centuries of artists trying to &quot;consider<br/>everything&quot;.
