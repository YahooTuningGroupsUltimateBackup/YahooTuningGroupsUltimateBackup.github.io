Why would you think so? The consonance of a chord depends<br/>&gt; on<br/>&gt; (a) the consonance of the individual intervals and (b) the closeness<br/>&gt; of<br/>&gt; the chord to a harmonic series (due to combination tone and virtual<br/>&gt; pitch effects). In no way does this imply a prime-limit measure.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Carl wrote me privately and suggested comparing these two chords:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; 1/1-5/4-3/2-15/8 vs. 1/1-5/4-3/2-11/6<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Here&apos;s an odd-limit analysis:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; The first chord has 2 3-limit intervals, 3 5-limit intervals, and 1<br/>&gt; 15-limit interval.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; The second chord has 1 3-limit interval, 2 5-limit intervals, 2<br/>&gt; 11-limit intervals, and 1 15-limit interval.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Clearly, then, the first chord is more consonant based on constituent<br/>&gt; intervals. Based on other non-dyadic criteria, such as conformity to a<br/>&gt; harmonic series and equivalence of the lowest note to the fundamental,<br/>&gt; the first chord is again more consonant. I don&apos;t think the prime limit<br/>&gt; adds any information. In fact, you can construct arbitrarily dissonant<br/>&gt; chords in the 3-prime-limit, while many chords of higher prime limits<br/>&gt; will clearly be more consonant.</p></div><h3>Dave Keenan &#x3C;d.keenan@uq.net.au&#x3E;</h3><span>3/2/1999 10:10:49 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>&gt;Message: 19<br/>&gt;   Date: Tue, 2 Mar 1999 15:29:26 -0500<br/>&gt;   From: Joseph L Monzo &lt;<a href="mailto:monz@juno.com">monz@juno.com</a>&gt;<br/>&gt;Subject: prime vs. odd limits<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;Gary Morrison wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt; The concept underlying prime limits is that we<br/>&gt;&gt; can factor out stacks of any interval (i.e., powers<br/>&gt;&gt; of any number) just as we can any arbitrary<br/>&gt;&gt; number of octaves. That being the case, powers<br/>&gt;&gt; of a given number become a minor consideration<br/>&gt;&gt; compared the number being there at all, which in<br/>&gt;&gt; turn means that the measuring stick has to be<br/>&gt;&gt; primes.  The concept then is that you can stack up<br/>&gt;&gt; as many 3s (for example) as you&apos;d like and the<br/>&gt;&gt; high-level character doesn&apos;t change much from just<br/>&gt;&gt; having one three.  That just as a factor of 4 or 8<br/>&gt;&gt; doesn&apos;t change the character of an interval much<br/>&gt;&gt; from a factor of 2.</p><p>I think we must start to consider just how much of a consideration is it to &quot;factor out&quot; (I&apos;d say cast out or ignore) the extra occurences of any given prime. How much does it &quot;cost&quot;. Clearly the cost for casting out 2&apos;s is very low. The cost of casting out a single 3 is middling, but casting out 2 or more 3&apos;s has a high cost, while casting out even a single extra 5 has a marked effect. i.e. 25/16 is quite different from 5/4.</p><p>Clearly prime limits err on the side of assuming they all have zero cost (sort of), while odd limits err by ignoring the moderate cost of a single 3 and assuming the cost of 2&apos;s is zero.

They don&apos;t seem to correspond to a static choice of cost factors, instead it seems that the highest prime to have a non-zero exponent has its exponent reduced to one, while all others go to zero. As such it seems rather hard to defend except for the fact that it almost treats 9 more realistically than do odd limits.</p><p>However, the prime limit turns out to be an approximation to a *logarithmic* complexity measure!
