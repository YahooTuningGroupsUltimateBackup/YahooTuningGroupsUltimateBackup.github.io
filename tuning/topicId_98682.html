The kalimba and mbira tuned to Mavila[7] (diatonic<br/>subset of 23 edo in this case) are the reason.</p><p>I&apos;m finding that I can do fantastically satisfying things (for me anyway,<br/>YMMV) by severely limiting my pitch set, and focusing on rhythm and groove.<br/>In a way, I find that this help the tuning be more &quot;digestible&quot;, too.</p><p>I already posted a video on YouTube a while back of my &quot;Queen of Hearts&quot;<br/>piece, but I want to share with you a fresh recording today that I&apos;m fairly<br/>happy with (save a buzzing sound I haven&apos;t diagnosed, which to my chagrin<br/>went away *AFTER* I had done this take). Oh well, mbiras are supposed to<br/>have a dirty rattle sound underneath, anyway. This piece (link below) is the<br/>more lyrical side of things I&apos;ve been doing; in the main I&apos;ve been doing<br/>some &quot;prog-rock a la King Crimson with Mavila&quot; type grooves. When I get a<br/>free moment, which is rare nowadays, I&apos;ll record an improv based on the<br/>handful of motivic/rhythmic sketches I&apos;ve jotted down over the past few<br/>months (I&apos;m off to teach at the moment).</p><p>What I like about this piece is the 17/8 meter not feeling, at least to me,<br/>that it&apos;s in your face. Maybe it&apos;s the gentler nature of the piece or the<br/>instrument. Most folks wouldn&apos;t notice it, I dare say. And I&apos;m loving the<br/>&quot;resultant melody/counterpoint&quot; aspect of the kalimba/mbira phenomenon. I<br/>feel like there&apos;s something here akin to what Leo Kottke does in his rather<br/>rhythmically textured guitar playing, if that makes sense.</p><p>Anyway, I hope you dig it.</p><p><a href="http://www.akjmusic.com/audio/queen_of_hearts.mp3">http://www.akjmusic.com/audio/queen_of_hearts.mp3</a></p><p>--<br/>Aaron Krister Johnson<br/><a href="http://www.akjmusic.com">http://www.akjmusic.com</a><br/><a href="http://www.untwelve.org">http://www.untwelve.org</a></p></div>
