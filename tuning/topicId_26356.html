I&apos;ve<br/>&gt; gotta go back and refresh my memory on MSB/LSB order; the LSB<br/>&gt; comes last, right?</p><p>Hey John,</p><p>I just realized we&apos;re thinking of two slightly<br/>different things. Yes, LSB comes last if using a 14bit<br/>CCs 0-31 (MSB) / 32-63 (LSB).</p><p>Most (all?) synths treat all of these as separate 7bit<br/>controllers though.</p><p>(Open question: Do any instruments use 14 bit CCs and<br/>do any sequencers provide support for editing them as<br/>14 bit values??)</p><p>--</p><p>The MSB/LSB I was speaking of is the [N]RPN MSB/LSB<br/>which are found at CCs #98-101. They work differently<br/>from the 14bit controllers.</p><p>The 14bit controllers all represent data and whatever<br/>value you send is instantly updated.</p><p>The [N]RPNs editing happens only when the data is<br/>changed using CCs 6,38,96 or 97.</p><p>Before you send the data byte[s], you select the<br/>parameter # with CCs 98/99 for RPNs and 100/101<br/>for NRPNs. Here the order is irrelevant because the<br/>edit does not accur until the data arrives. The<br/>comments I made in the last message still apply.</p><p>The tricky part is that if you are sending a lot of<br/>[N]RPN edits to an instrument in a sequence, the [N]RPN<br/>edits might get interleaved and so each message needs<br/>to be atomicized (made into a single unit) so that the<br/>messages don&apos;t get scrambled. It&apos;s a lot easier to<br/>handle this if the sequencer understands what [N]RPN<br/>messages are and doesn&apos;t treat them like just another<br/>CC.</p><p>- Jeff</p></div>
