I can&apos;t find the piece mentioned in his list of works,<br/>&gt;though he did have an interest in American popular music in the period<br/>&gt;1921-22. Was it originally for piano?</p><p>No idea, Bill. &quot;Well-Tempered Ragtime- 1921&quot; is how it&apos;s titled in the<br/>MIDI<br/>file. It sounds like what one might expect a ragtime piano piece by a<br/>fella<br/>called &quot;Hindemith&quot; to sound. I mean that in a good way...</p><p>&gt;In fact, I think Hindemith felt the necessity to defend the use of 12 tones<br/>&gt;in an attempt to refute microtonalists (Carillo, Haba), while at the same<br/>&gt;time relating the derived pitches to a single tonic in an attempt to refute<br/>&gt;the possibility or desirability of atonality (Schoenberg, et al.).</p><p>He certainly seems to have expended a lot of energy (writings, etc.) on<br/>it.</p><p>I&apos;ve been reading a bit more about Hindemith in Daniel T. Politoske&apos;s<br/>&quot;Music&quot;. Hindemith is quoted as having written (in &quot;A Composer&apos;s World&quot;),<br/>&quot;...there is only a limited number of harmonic and tonal combinations,<br/>and no matter how big this number is, it will be exhausted after<br/>centuries of continuous use.&quot; But,he is also said to have attacked<br/>other modern composers and in general objected stringly to new avant-<br/>garde systems. (Guess he&apos;d have luuuved us, eh ?)</p><p>&gt;In one of Haba&apos;s books, it is mentioned that Hindemith played viola in<br/>&gt;one of his quartets and was very concerned to get the quarter-tone<br/>&gt;intonation correct to Haba&apos;s satisfaction.</p><p>Curiouser and curiouser...</p><p>So, maybe the &quot;Well-Tempered Ragtime- 1921&quot; is a hoax, or a fluke ?</p><p>Best wishes &amp; great dishes,<br/>Drew</p></div>
