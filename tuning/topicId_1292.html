I&apos;ve found 10-tone scales that<br/>&gt;function &quot;diatonically&apos; in 22-tET and give you rich 7-limit harmonic<br/>&gt;resources (tetrads instead of triads):</p><p>Yes, my use of the word &quot;odd&quot; was off the mark.  Looking at some ET<br/>scales, it would seem that:</p><p>19-tET, 26-tET, 31-tET, and 43-tET are meantone scales: they narrow<br/>the fifth, eat the syntonic comma, and take the resulting thirds.  All<br/>have only a single major second interval: four fifths &quot;equal&quot; a major<br/>third.</p><p>22-tET, 34-tET, 41-tET, and 53-tET all widen the fifth compared to<br/>12-tone, and compared to just (except 53TET, which is ALMOST exactly<br/>right!).  All support the syntonic comma (i.e., show net microtonal<br/>motion) in the progression I-vi-ii-V-I.  All have two major second<br/>intervals: four fifths do NOT equal a major third.</p><p>(I have long considered 53-tET to be a beautiful thing, since its base<br/>microtonal interval falls nicely between a Pythagorean comma and a<br/>syntonic comma, but I&apos;ve never written music in it...)</p><p>As for your 22-tET to adaptive JI challenge (if I may call it that),<br/>can you tell me where I might find a 22-tET sequence to work with?  What<br/>file format is used?</p><p>Implicit in the pitch-bending method of tuning is a sharp limitation on<br/>the number of voices that can be sounding simultaneously, since each<br/>note, except for octave intervals, needs its own channel.  A single<br/>voice (piano?) is comfortable; two may work when 16 MIDI channels are<br/>available (as they are with General MIDI - well, 15 are, anyway...).</p><p>JdL</p></div>
