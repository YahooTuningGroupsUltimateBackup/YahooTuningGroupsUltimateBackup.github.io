This includes  Werckmeister&apos; enharmonic ident<br/>VI. W.<br/>&gt; 1692, too. We know that  Werckmeister was dead against meantone.<br/>It was for a<br/>&gt; previous era,  from Werckmeister&apos; previous era,  from Werc<br/>revolution in<br/>&gt;  thinking, and a great reason for Buxtehude and Werckmeister to<br/>become  friends.<br/>&gt; Bach, too, if a bit younger.</p><p>Brad:<br/>1. Do you have any evidence whatsoever that  Bach ever met<br/>Werckmeister, or that they were ever friends?</p><p>Johnny:<br/>There are connections to be made between Werckmeister  and Bach, although<br/>they never met.  Bach&apos;s cousin, Johann Walther, studied  with Werckmeister, while<br/>continuing correspondence afterwards until Werckmeister  passed away.<br/>Additionally, Werckmeister sent his cousin many different  works, especially works<br/>by Buxtehude.  Werckmeister inherited the entire  Praetorious collection, btw.<br/>Werckmeister was practically a next door  neighbor in terms of georgraphical<br/>proximity.  Werckmeister&apos;s ideas were  the big, bright ideas of the time,<br/>fully exploited by Bach at the age of 18 in  Arnstadt when he adjudicated the new<br/>organ in Arnstadt built by Wender,  identified as in the Werckmeister camp by<br/>Kuhnau (as opposed to the meantone  Silbermann).</p><p>Brad:<br/>2. Werckmeister&apos;2. Werckmeister&apos;&lt;WBR&gt;s &quot;III&quot; temperament (the  on<br/>&quot;correct&quot; temp) doesn&apos;t solve meantone&apos;s problems. It  leaves four of<br/>the five worst and most obvious problems in place! It gets rid  of the<br/>wolf 5th, sure, but it doesn&apos;t get rid of the four wide  diminished<br/>4ths (typically F#-Bb, C#-F, G#-C, and B-Eb). All it does is  trim<br/>them down a little bit to become Pythagorean in size,  *less*<br/>annoyingly far out of tune...only a full syntonic comma too  wide.</p><p>Johnny:<br/>This is your own well expressed and passionate point of  view.  It likely<br/>influences many, internationally, who are swayed by such  detailed passion.<br/>Only...it doesn&apos;t hold up to scrutiny.  Surely, you  must recognize that I<br/>disagree with you.  The larger fourths are  delicious.  It does so much for the music<br/>of Bach.  It lends character  to the well-temperament that is Bach, making<br/>musically craggy what is  otherwise more stark.  According to Werckmeister&apos;s,<br/>meantone&apos;s problem  number one is the howling wolf.  There were other items, too<br/>many  accidentals,  too many new notes requiring subsemitones, too<br/>non-chromatic as a result, etc.</p><p>Brad:<br/>3. What &quot;revolution in thinking&quot; is this idea of  modifying regular<br/>meantone layouts so they sound better in more keys? You&apos;d  have to<br/>prove that nobody before Werckmeister ever conceived of, or  said<br/>anything about, or ever *did* in practice, any spreading-around  of<br/>pure 5ths here and there to get rid of a wolf. Maybe John Bull<br/>thought  of it, or somebody else, generations before Werckmeister was<br/>even born. How  do you &quot;know&quot; that Werckmeister was making up anything<br/>that was in any way  new?</p><p>Johnny:  Actually, you would have to prove there  was someone earlier, which<br/>you have not.  Even if someone had preceded  Werckmeister, perhaps someone in<br/>China, it doesn&apos;t have the clout of influence  that makes the difference.<br/>This same clout is right on top of the young  and impressionable JS Bach.  To my<br/>knowledge, W. is the first to write  of the circle of fifths which allowed for<br/>the homogenization of the  enharmonic identities into the same note.<br/>Admittedly, Marin Mersenne wrote  theoretically about equal temperament, even Zarlino<br/>wrote about equal  temperament for lutes, but Werckmeister is the man when it<br/>came to a circular  well temperament on the organ and other keyboards.  BTW,<br/>WIII is  recommended for all keyboards, not just the organ, as some have<br/>implied.</p><p>Brad:<br/>4. How do you suppose that Bach&apos;s uncle, the  one he called &quot;the<br/>profound composer&quot;, was tuning in Eisenach when JSB was  born there in<br/>1685 (and before that)? That elder Bach&apos;s music is  chromatically<br/>adventurous, too, and doesn&apos;t really work in any sort of  meantone.<br/>Couldn&apos;t he have been using some circulating temperament(Couldn&apos;t he h<br/>way before Werckmeister put anything into print?</p><p>Johnny:<br/>Yes, I believe Uncle JC Bach did use what came to be  called WIII tuning, if<br/>not one of the other variants.  W. was very careful  not to imply he invented<br/>it.  It was already in use.  The big gun in  the neighborhood of W. was uncle<br/>JC.  They probably met, JC and AW, if only  because of their mutual interests,<br/>accomplishments, and fame.  Both was  mugged by the system and complained<br/>about it (e.g., wages being robbed,  misunderstandings by those around them,<br/>chromaticism, from a famous family of  musicians).</p><p>Brad:<br/>Again, where do you<br/>get the idea that W&apos;s work was  revolutionary? Are you just studying<br/>*published documents*, or are you  studying real music and the notes<br/>used in it?</p><p>Johnny:  I&apos;ve written a book on the subject Bach  and Tuning.  Now that the<br/>school season is winding up, I should be able to  finish a version of the book<br/>that can be distributed.  Certainly, if I were  to simply rehash what has<br/>already been published there would be no purpose to  volunteer to spend so many<br/>hours over 3 decades.  I learned to speak German  for this.  I wrote a master<br/>thesis at columbia university on this.  I  visited and researched in Leipzig,<br/>Muhlhausen, Eisenach, Kothen, Arnstadt,  Erfurt, and Wolfenbuttal to this<br/>effort.  Perhaps you could say I am taking  a more ethnomusicologically-influenced<br/>study.  The unequalness that makes  up well temperament is part of the<br/>Thuringian aesthetic of the period, as a  visit to Werckmeister&apos;s Quedlinburg church<br/>door demonstrates.</p><p>&gt;<br/>&gt; I believe Buxtehude shared with  Werckmeister the distaste for<br/>meantone which<br/>&gt; comes out of an  improviser&apos;s mind set. My email to Tom outlined the<br/>case<br/>&gt; for an  organ improviser to need a full circle of keys to be<br/>virtuosic, to be<br/>&gt; even, to be interesting (since there are greater differences  between<br/>keys in<br/>&gt; such tunings).</p><p>Brad:<br/>Gee, Johnny, you don&apos;t need to sell the  improvisation idea to *me*.<br/>I&apos;ve been improvising organ pieces in public for  more than 20 years.<br/>...<br/>Johnny:  Glad to hear of it.  Too bad you  didn&apos;t make it clear earlier.  Do<br/>you identify with the idea of needing a  full circle palate for chromatic<br/>improvisation?</p><p>Brad:<br/>And especially, have you read pages 213-217 in part 2  where I laid out<br/>my measurements of W-III, showing why it&apos;s lumpy?</p><p>Johnny: How academic.  I sing Werckmeister III  tuning, as I sing Harry<br/>Partch Li Po Songs.  What you call lumpy I find  dramatic.  Do you fully realize<br/>that this List includes all manner of  different tuning systems.  In recent<br/>years I have explored  polymicrotonality.  You could say I have the stretched ears<br/>that George  Ives hoped for his son Charles.  I don&apos;t see how your writing<br/>how  something sounds bad trumps my hearing that same something sounding good.<br/>Off hand, I don&apos;t recall anything that long (217 pages) that you wrote.<br/>Probably you mean the second part of the Oxford publication.  It&apos;s been  some<br/>time now.  I&apos;ll take another look.</p><p>Brad: As always, all the parts of it (seven files for  reading, plus some<br/>recorded musical examples) are freely downloadable from  here:<br/>_http://www-personalhttp://www-<a href="http://www-phttp">http://www-phttp</a>://www-p_<br/>(<a href="http://www-personal.umich.edu/~bpl/larips/outline.html">http://www-personal.umich.edu/~bpl/larips/outline.html</a>)</p><p>&gt;  Johnny: &gt; I do not want to be insulting.</p><p>Brad:<br/>Nor do I. I do point out, though, that I have a  lot more stake in<br/>playing harpsichord than you do.</p><p>Johnny: I don&apos;t think this is true.  I produce  concerts and CDs with<br/>harpsichord all the time.  I want the harpsichord to  sound magnificent.  To that end<br/>I have been quite critical of certain  instruments in certain combinations,<br/>and blends.  We have a new instrument  now that really brought us into a new<br/>dimension.  WIII tuning with its 8  pure fifths give a great richness to the<br/>instrument.  Everything I produce  has to have something very special about it.<br/>Almost 30 years now.</p><p>Brad:<br/>Well, carry on. My wife needs the computer  back now. :)<br/>Brad Lehman</p><p>Johnny:<br/>Thank you for trying to see what I am doing.</p><p>: )</p><p>**************Gas prices getting you down?
