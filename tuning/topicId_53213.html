Analytical theory, as I&apos;ve<br/>experienced it, has a miserable record of predicting<br/>breakthroughs like Beethoven and the jazz.</p><p>&gt;&gt;Anyway, the CPS method can generate scales that span the gamut<br/>&gt;&gt;of what is possible with scales.  Any approach to composition, in<br/>&gt;&gt;the common-practice sense, would have to be based on the actual<br/>&gt;&gt;scale resulting from the particular CPS used.  And the best way<br/>&gt;&gt;to get into that is to practice composing in the scale (fancy<br/>&gt;&gt;that).<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;Well, sure.

Or you could try a more staid approach.... if you&apos;re into<br/>Partch, you might first check out the tonality diamond, via<br/>Partch&apos;s own advice on that.*  After, the 11-limit Eikosany will<br/>probably seem like Christmas (hint, hint, Prent Rodgers...).</p><p>* Via _Genesis of a Music_, and also check out the audio lecture<br/>on *Enclosure 2*.</p><p>&gt;&gt; If you stick with the 11-limit Eikosany, as featured in Wilson&apos;s<br/>&gt;&gt; XH12 article, you do get a list of (unsaturated) 11-limit tetrads<br/>&gt;&gt; that are joined by common dyads (as shown in Wilson&apos;s diagrams).<br/>&gt;&gt; Chord progressions fall out of these diagrams quite readily.  He<br/>&gt;&gt; also shows that you can embed the Eikosany in a chain of fifths,<br/>&gt;&gt; which presumably gives one a model for drumming out melodies.

We can take 12 Et and treat<br/>the thirds as either consonances or dissonances and create extensive music<br/>which sounds right to our ears. the human musical ear picks up on these<br/>predetermined patterns that appear as a result of such theories and adjust<br/>to them.<br/>    Composers such as Xenakis seem to also elicit a recognition of such an<br/>ordered world. even Feldman who used no system beyond his intuition, makes<br/>us perceive an order. I believe our ears have gotten to a point where we<br/>can recognize such structural processes (resulting from the theory)  quite<br/>quickly.<br/>    Of course to base a system on say whole tones as consonances and fifths<br/>as disonances with 12 ET would not work i don&apos;t think. In such a case<br/>though we can learn this &apos;language&apos; which might come off comic.
