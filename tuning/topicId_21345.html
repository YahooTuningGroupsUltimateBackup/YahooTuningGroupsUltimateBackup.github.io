And what we tap into, when we seek these<br/>archetypal essences, is something that does not necessarily require<br/>us to be preservationists of his music to benefit from. Namely that<br/>of learning how to see inside of our unique creative visions, and<br/>have the bravery to make them live in actual living works of music<br/>(theatre?). Being able to harness the power of the most sublime and<br/>noble forms of artistic fantasy and conceptual thought, is something<br/>that can provide a wellspring of energy toward completion of the<br/>creative cycle. With Partch, we see someone who was a complete<br/>package of many wonders - theoretical, musical, philosophical - and<br/>were we might not care to attempt the folly of exactly duplicating<br/>his work, we may derive something profound from the example set by<br/>any who put it all together in such brilliant and lasting ways.</p><p>I&apos;m blessed to know many folks out there making it live today, and<br/>making living examples for our living time (there&apos;s a bunch of you<br/>right here!).</p><p>We are *NOW*!</p><p>Let&apos;s harness *this moment* to create new models for the new<br/>languages we have happening right now.</p><p>We have sufficient heroes to look to.</p><p>Thanks,</p><p>Jacky Ligon</p></div><h3>Afmmjr@aol.com</h3><span>4/20/2001 8:09:44 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>I appreciate very much the understanding exhibited by the List.  Thought you<br/>might like to see this paragraph from an interview with Dean Drummond in the<br/>Newmusicbox.</p><p>&quot;&quot;I loved Harry Partch as a person, and from the time I got the instruments I<br/>could almost feel his presence there,&quot; he says. &quot;But to tell you the truth,<br/>he gets further and further away all the time. He provided theories as a<br/>learning tool, not dogma, and even he as a practitioner used his ideas very<br/>freely. The best thing about him was that he opened whole new ways to become<br/>a self-made person.&quot;</p><p>    Dean Drummond</p></div>
