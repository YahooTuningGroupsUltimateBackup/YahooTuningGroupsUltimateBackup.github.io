What did he think of it?<br/>&gt; I think of Hanson as being a rather conservative composer.  After<br/>&gt; attending his school, it even reinforced my opinion...</p><p>Kassel 1996 documents that Partch submitted his earliest known<br/>JI composition, a string quartet from the late 1920s, to Hanson<br/>in hopes of a performance.  It is now lost, and apparently<br/>Partch didn&apos;t have it to hand when _Genesis_ was first published<br/>in 1949, because he mentions it and says nothing else about it.</p><p>A side note: I find it really encouraging that an intellect<br/>of the stature of Barzun has embraced Partch and his work<br/>so sympathetically.  I have found Partch&apos;s name mentioned<br/>several different times in Barzun&apos;s work.</p><p>Barzun&apos;s latest book was the jumping-off point for a fantastic<br/>lecture I attended at UCSD a couple of months ago given<br/>by Chou wen-Chung.  (I posted something about it here then.)<br/>AFAIK, Barzun is still alive, and very old.</p><p>-monz<br/><a href="http://www.monz.org">http://www.monz.org</a><br/>&quot;All roads lead to n^0&quot;</p><p>_________________________________________________________<br/>Do You Yahoo!?<br/>Get your free <a href="https://twitter.com/yahoo">@yahoo</a>.com address at <a href="http://mail.yahoo.com">http://mail.yahoo.com</a></p></div><h3><a id=25738 href="#25738">ðŸ”—</a>Jon Szanto &#x3C;JSZANTO@ADNC.COM&#x3E;</h3><span>6/27/2001 9:30:22 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Monz,</p><p>--- In tuning@y..., &quot;monz&quot; &lt;joemonz@y...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt; A side note: I find it really encouraging that an intellect<br/>&gt; of the stature of Barzun has embraced Partch and his work<br/>&gt; so sympathetically.
