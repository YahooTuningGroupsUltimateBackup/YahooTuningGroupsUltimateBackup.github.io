This particular event was organized by Bill Alves and held at<br/>Pomona College in Claremont, Calif.  It was supported in part by the<br/>Garrett Fund of the Department of Humanities and Social Sciences of<br/>Harvey Mudd College and was presented in association with Pierce<br/>College, the North American Embassy of Anaphoria Island and the Pomona<br/>College Department of Music.</p><p>The first half of the concert featured solo performances by John<br/>Schneider, Kraig Grady, and Joe Monzo.  Schneider performed two pieces<br/>this evening.  The first was his transcription for justly-tuned guitar<br/>of the  &quot;Palace Music&quot; from Lou Harrison&apos;s puppet opera &quot;Young Caesar,&quot;<br/>about an affair young Julius had with the King of Bithynia early in his<br/>political and military career.  The piece was originally for solo harp<br/>and sounds very good in this arrangement.</p><p>I had attended a work-in-progress performance of Young Caesar performed<br/>on the late Bill Colvig&apos;s home-built instruments, puppets, and a<br/>scrolling background in the early 70&apos;s.  I have wondered how it might<br/>sound rewritten for other media when I heard that it had been rescored<br/>for live actors and conventional instruments in 12.  I can say<br/>conclusively that this selection succeeds admirably when transcribed for<br/>JI guitar.</p><p>It has always been a pleasure to hear John Schneider play and the second<br/>piece, his own composition, &quot;Lament,&quot; in extended Pythagorean intonation<br/>was fully up to my expectations.  Tense major thirds are prominent<br/>intervals in this piece, but personally, I enjoyed them.</p><p>Kraig Grady presented &quot;Three Themes&quot; condensed from the music that<br/>accompanies the shadow play &quot;Black Eye Meru,&quot; which is part of the<br/>continuing stream of music from Anaphoria Island that Kraig has been<br/>performing in recent years.  Although not in Anaphorian costume this<br/>time, Kraig gave a virtuoso solo performance on a vibraphone in the<br/>tuning described by Ervin Wilson as &quot;meta-slendro.&quot;  This tuning is<br/>based on cycles of approximately 487 cents and is congenial to<br/>pentatonic scalar patterns.  Anaphorian music also employs unusual<br/>rhythms in scale-like patterns the details of which I refer you to the<br/>Anaphoria Island web pages.</p><p>The final performer in the first half was Joe Monzo with whose music I<br/>was mostly unfamiliar, although I have known Joe for several years and<br/>had driven up from San Diego with him, Brian and Joe&apos;s friend Linda.  It<br/>was a very pleasant experience to discover that he is an engaging<br/>performer and a skilled and imaginative composer.  His performance piece<br/>was a setting of Walt Whitman&apos;s poem, &quot;A Noiseless, Patient Spider,&quot; for<br/>intoning voice and electronics that was premiered in 1999 in New York at<br/>Johnny Reinhard&apos;s &quot;American Festival of Microtonal Music.&quot;  The<br/>electronic passages employ a variety of intervals both in 5-limit just<br/>and 12-tone equal temperament. The vocal and electronic episodes are<br/>accompanied by images of tonal lattices that invoked visions of a spider<br/>diligently weaving her web. My only suggestion would be that the images<br/>would be more effective if enlarged and projected rather than being<br/>presented as graphics on large sheets of paper.</p><p>After a brief intermission, the concert resumed with films and videos<br/>with microtonal scores. The first item was a compilation of short<br/>excerpts from four films with scores by Stephen James Taylor. Taylor is<br/>an amazingly talented and versatile composer whose credits include<br/>orchestral music for the opening ceremonies at the 1996 Olympics and the<br/>scores to the films &quot;Why Do Fools Fall In Love?&quot; and &quot;The Giving,&quot; the<br/>latter a searing film about homeless people in Los Angeles that used<br/>authentically homeless people as actors.  Taylor has also scored a<br/>number of animated features and TV series, including the &quot;Timon and<br/>Pumbaa&quot; cartoon, one of whose scores was nominated for a Daytime Emmy<br/>award. In his film and video work, he has used African tunings from<br/>Mozambique, Wilson&apos;s 1.3.5.7.9.11.13.15 Hebdomekontany, a 17-tone<br/>Pythagorean cycle, and a 23-tone scale based on a cycle of intervals<br/>that are successive approximations to the Golden Section.  This<br/>compilation was a tantalizing aural glimpse into Taylor&apos;s microtonal<br/>oeuvre, and I would hope that longer sections or complete works could be<br/>presented at later MicroFests.</p><p>Excerpts from three short films by James Broughton with scores by Lou<br/>Harrison were shown next. James Broughton was a San Francisco filmmaker,<br/>poet and playwright and a longtime friend of Harrison. The films were<br/>&quot;Nuptiae,&quot; on the theme of marriage; &quot;Devotions,&quot; about gay love; and<br/>&quot;Scattered Remains,&quot; an autobiographical sketch about the filmmaker.<br/>Harrison&apos;s music is scored for a mixture of European and Asian<br/>instruments and exhibits his characteristic and wonderful talent for<br/>melody.  Lou later reworked the score to &quot;Scattered Remains&quot; as a<br/>separate composition and published it as &quot;Air for the Poet.&quot;</p><p>I had not seen &quot;Windsong,&quot; nor any of the other films with Harry<br/>Partch&apos;s music for many years, so I was eager to see it again.<br/>The story line is the myth of Daphne and Apollo as translated by Partch<br/>to the shores of Lake Michigan in 1957-8.  I must admit that the music<br/>has held up somewhat better than the film, which seems to me to reflect<br/>the artistic style and taste of the 1950&apos;s too strongly. However, the<br/>film definitely merits viewing. Its rather spare score was later revised<br/>and performed with dancers at UCSD as &quot;Daphne of the Dunes.&quot; The UCSD<br/>performance, which I attended, was videotaped and, I believe, is now<br/>available.</p><p> Ptolemy&apos;s Equable Diatonic tetrachord appears prominently in one of the<br/>harmonic canon parts, though many other 11-limit ratios are used on<br/>Partch&apos;s unique orchestra of specially constructed microtonal acoustic<br/>instruments. The filmmaker and star of Windsong, Madeleine Tourtelot,<br/>also filmed Partch in his studio playing and recording all the parts to<br/>the score.  This film, &quot;Music Studio&quot; is a unique document of Partch&apos;s<br/>working methods and musical creativity. It also deserves showing more often.</p><p>In fact, I think a Harry Partch Film Festival is long overdue.  I tried<br/>to organize one myself in Houston some years ago, but after the films<br/>had arrived, the venue, Diverse Works, informed us that there was<br/>scheduling conflict and we had to cancel the event.  There is also a<br/>film portrait of Lou Harrison by the filmmaker Eric Marin with the title<br/>&quot;Cherish, Conserve, Consider, &quot; a concise summation of Lou&apos;s personal<br/>philosophy.  It would make an interesting contrast and accompaniment to<br/>the Partch films.</p><p>The concert ended with &quot;Static Cling,&quot; a superb computer video by Bill<br/>Alves with a score in &quot;free style&quot; just intonation. This work is based<br/>on sounds and images taken from local nightly news broadcasts and<br/>transmogrified with Csound and the POVRAY animation language.  The<br/>influence of computer animation pioneer John Whitney Sr. (author of<br/>&quot;Digital Music&quot;) was evident in the abstract animation. &quot;Free Style&quot; is<br/>a technique invented by Lou Harrison in which the melodic movement is by<br/>simple JI ratios although a global tonic or (pre)defined scale may not<br/>be present. It works excellently in the track for this video, which, by<br/>the way, is available along with &quot;Hiway 70&quot; and &quot;Collateral Damage&quot; from<br/>the Just Intonation Network.</p><p>After the concert, there was a reception for the performers and<br/>attendees. One of the major benefits of this kind of event is the<br/>opportunity to meet and interact with old friends and new internet<br/>acquaintances. It was a pleasure for me to see David Canright again and<br/>to meet Mark Nowitsky, without whose efforts this List would not exist.<br/>I can&apos;t resist adding that the food and drink were excellent and far<br/>above the usual college standard. All of us took advantage of the buffet<br/>table before heading back to San Diego, Los Angeles, etc.</p><p>Bill Alves deserves great credit for organizing this event and I hope<br/>others can be held at this site. Unfortunately, I was unable to attend<br/>the other three concerts in the series this year and cannot comment on<br/>them beyond reporting that Kraig Grady said they went well.</p></div>
