It looks like since<br/>just a few manufacturers are really interested in this topic because<br/>of the limited commercial power of such a feature, nobody is making<br/>any sort of pressure on them to improve and have full MTS support on<br/>their products(?) I myself have to admit that concentrating my<br/>attention only on software synths does not help that much.</p><p>Regards,<br/>Victor</p></div>
