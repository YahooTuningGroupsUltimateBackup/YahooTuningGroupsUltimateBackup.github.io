If<br/>you play an integer otonal chord with inharmonic timbres, you&apos;ll get a nice<br/>clear harmonic series above _each_ partial in the lowest &quot;note&quot;, which is a<br/>nice effect that some people on the list (I recall Darren Burgess and Carl<br/>Lumma specifically), though the typical roles of timbre and tuning are in<br/>effect switched here! On the other hand, if you play a stretched &quot;otonal&quot;<br/>chord, you&apos;ll have a lot less roughness, though the &quot;fuzziness&quot; will of<br/>course be considerable.</p><p>John, I&apos;d strongly suggest you look at John R. Pierce&apos;s nice little book<br/>_The Science of Musical Sound_. He recounts his own experiences with coming<br/>up with ideas much like Sethares&apos; (in the chapter _Helmholtz and<br/>Consonance_) and then recounts how he had a rude awakening in certain<br/>experiments to test these ideas (in the chapter _Rameau and Harmony_).</p><p>So to answer your question, there may be a compromise that would be most<br/>appropriate here -- but since the &quot;fuzziness&quot; won&apos;t go away with any tuning,<br/>the roughness component will dominate the compromise, since the roughness<br/>_can_ be completely eliminated here.</p><p>Actually, as Terhardt points out, the ideal set of partials for evocation of<br/>virtual pitch are slightly stretched -- as (perhaps relatedly) are the<br/>melodic octaves perceived as correct when sine waves are used. However,<br/>these would imply a theoretical octave of 2.02 or 2.01, so this is not of<br/>much consequence for your example here, where the stretching is an order of<br/>magnitude higher.</p></div><h3><a id=17984 href="#17984">ðŸ”—</a>ligonj@northstate.net</h3><span>1/26/2001 1:32:02 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In tuning@y..., &quot;Paul H.
