Paul Erlich will also be in town<br/>that weekend, and we expect to get together.</p><p>I&apos;m also hoping that I can see eminent Mahler authority<br/>Lew Smoley while there.  I&apos;m sure a dinner-type meeting<br/>would be OK with him if anyone else is interested.</p><p>Saturday the 16th is also the anniversary of Beethoven&apos;s<br/>birth - always a special holiday for me.   :)</p><p>A private or public response is fine with me - whichever<br/>is deemed more appropriate given the circumstances of the<br/>message.</p><p>-monz</p></div>
