Matlab is far better than Derive<br/>for straight numerical work.</p><p>One other free package, very little known, is Perl Data Language (PDL). It<br/>is mostly an image processing environment, very popular among astronomers.<br/>It does exist for Windows, but the last time I looked the UNIX<br/>implementation was a boatload better.</p><p>I had SciLab or something like it once upon a time; it was, in a word,<br/>humongous, and I deleted it from my disk.</p><p>There used to be a free symbolic package on the web; the name escapes me at<br/>the moment, though. If it still exists, I can track it down if anyone is<br/>interested.</p><p>Free *statistics* packages? Well, there&apos;s a number of specialized ones, but<br/>there are four more general ones that I like. Xlispstat runs on UNIX, Mac<br/>and Windows. There are two packages layered on Xlispstat called ViSta<br/>(Visual Statistics) and ARC. Xlispstat comes on the Red Hat CD if you&apos;re a<br/>Linux geek. ViSta is available for Windows, Mac and UNIX, but the Windows<br/>version is the only one being actively enhanced at present. ARC is mostly<br/>about regression and graphics and is available for all three Xlispstat<br/>platforms (I think). As the name implies, the underlying language is LISP.</p><p>Then there is R, formerly known as GNU S. R is a very flexible statistics<br/>and graphics package. The underlying language is an efficient dialect of<br/>LISP I&apos;ve seen mentioned here, called Scheme. R is available for Windows and<br/>UNIX; I don&apos;t know about Mac. I can post the URLs if anyone is interested.<br/>--<br/>M.
