The consonant chords<br/>&gt; were 3-limit dyads, but three of those would cover at most 6 notes,<br/>&gt; while the diatonic scale has 7. The diatonic scale with 3-limit<br/>&gt; harmony is another system which I wanted to leave out of my paper<br/>&gt; for brevity, but clearly cannot be dismissed altogether, as it was a<br/>&gt; language in which great musical works were produced for a few<br/>&gt; centuries.</p><p>This apparent exception to the &quot;three-chord-covering&quot; property invites<br/>a further discussion of Gothic harmony, maybe beginning with a few<br/>important cautions. My purpose here is to consider how a &quot;tonality&quot;<br/>might be conceptualized and defined in Gothic music, and more<br/>specifically in 13th-century writing for three or four voices.</p><p>Rather than open with a series of caveats taking considerable space, I<br/>would simply caution that the following is my attempt to follow an<br/>approach not inconsistent with actual Gothic theory. The medieval<br/>theory of polyphony seems more focused on vertical sonorities and on<br/>some ornamental and formal graces than on questions of &quot;mode&quot; or<br/>scale, so what follows may reflect mainly my own proclivities.</p><p>Also, it would be well to observe that Paul Erlich himself has here<br/>emphasized that his &quot;three-chord coverage&quot; property is intended mainly<br/>to caution on the consequences of certain complex modern tuning<br/>schemes, rather than to present a universal standard.</p><p>The complete unit of three-voice Gothic harmony is what Johannes de<br/>Grocheio (c. 1300) refers to as embodying a _trina harmoniae<br/>perfectio_ or &quot;threefold perfection of harmony,&quot; and to which I shall<br/>refer in English as a trine. One might define a trine as the 3-limit<br/>equivalent of a 5-limit triad; it consists of an outer octave, and an<br/>adjacent fifth and fourth:</p><p>  |  d&apos;                 |  d<br/>  |     4               |     5<br/>8 |  a                8 |  g<br/>  |     5               |     4<br/>  |  d                  |  d</p><p>Note that in medieval theory, the octave counts as a &quot;real&quot; interval,<br/>so that we have indeed a sonority of three tones and intervals. With<br/>the fifth below and the fourth above, we have the more smooth and<br/>conclusive form; with the converse arrangement, the harmony is<br/>relatively stable but less conclusive. We may refer to these forms<br/>respectively as 8|5-4 and 8|4-5 -- i.e. outer|lower-upper. Partchian<br/>theorists might see these forms as representing respectively otonality<br/>(2:3:4) and utonality (1/2:1/3:1/4), these numbers representing<br/>frequency ratios (string ratios being conversely 6:4:3 and 4:3:2).</p><p>We may take a trine as the vertical embodiment of an octave-species,<br/>including for the present purposes _eight_ diatonic notes,<br/>e.g. d-d&apos;. Following medieval concepts, we may regard these eight<br/>tones as basic, but tones _beyond_ the octave as essentially<br/>replicates: thus a diatonic octave-species has eight tones, as opposed<br/>to seven or more than eight.[1]</p><p>Definitely engaging in the participatory sports of neologism as well<br/>as &quot;neo-medieval&quot; theorizing, I might propose the term _trinality_ to<br/>describe a stable trinic center plus the various other sonorities<br/>which might be formed from the material of its octave-species.</p><p>CAUTION: Note that while many 13th-century pieces use exclusively or<br/>almost exclusively the tones of a single diatonic octave-species,<br/>inflections such as Bb/B and F/F# are not uncommon. Indeed, both B and<br/>Bb are part of the basic medieval gamut or system of _musica recta_,<br/>and they may fluidly alternate in a single melody; or we may have a<br/>signature of Bb in the lowest part only, with a default of B in the<br/>others. However, for the sake of initial simplicity, let us assume an<br/>octave-species of eight tones.</p><p>Focusing mainly on the more conclusive 8|5-4 trine, we find that this<br/>might be said to include the scale degrees 1-5-8, here written as<br/>^1-^5-^8 to avoid confusion with all-important vertical intervals. The<br/>less conclusive 8|4-5 trine would be ^1-^4-^8 -- but let us here<br/>concentrate on the more conclusive form.</p><p>While Erlich&apos;s &quot;consonant chord&quot; might be read to mean a stable<br/>sonority, in fact much of the feeling for scale and &quot;trinality&quot; in<br/>Gothic music, at least for me, centers on cadential action involving<br/>the contrast between stable trines and _unstable_ sonorities. Here I<br/>use _cadential_ in its broad medieval sense of a tension-relaxation<br/>progression in which unstable intervals resolve to stable ones; in<br/>some compositions, what one might call &quot;microcadences&quot; can occur at<br/>almost any &quot;change in harmony&quot; (motion of the lowest voice).</p><p>From this viewpoint, given the pervasive role of unstable sonorities<br/>and cadential progressions in this music (3-limit has the virtue of a<br/>wealth of unstable sonorities), it is easy to find progressions of<br/>three or fewer sonorities which can either explicitly or virtually<br/>cover a complete trinality or octave-species. Taking first the case<br/>where all eight tones are explicitly presented:</p><p>d&apos; e&apos; f&apos;          ^6  ^7  ^8<br/>a  b  c&apos;          ^3  ^4  ^5<br/>g     f           ^2      ^1</p><p>In this cadential formula for a trinality on F, we have a relatively<br/>consonant but unstable combination of g-a-d&apos; or 5|M2-4 followed by a<br/>somewhat more tense g-b-e&apos; or M6|M3-4 resolving to a trine of f-c&apos;-f&apos;<br/>(M6-8 + M3-5). In terms of scale degrees, we have all eight<br/>represented.</p><p>It is possible to classify the notes of an octave-species into three<br/>groups, from a cadential standpoint. Tones ^1-^5-^8 define the stable<br/>trinic center and goal; adjacent tones ^2, ^4, ^6, and ^7 typically<br/>occur in penultimate unstable sonorities and tend to resolve ^2-^1,<br/>^4-^5, ^6-^5, and ^7-^8. &quot;Mixing and matching&quot; these progressions<br/>generally produces cadences in which unstable intervals resolve by<br/>conjunct contrary motion, as in the following impressive example in<br/>four voices:</p><p>e&apos; f&apos;         ^7-^8<br/>d&apos; c&apos;         ^6-^5<br/>b  c&apos;         ^4-^5<br/>g  f          ^2-^1</p><p>(M6-8 + M3-5 + m3-1 + M2-4)</p><p>Note that these two sonorities represent all tones except ^3, the only<br/>tone neither included in ^1-^5-^8 nor adjacent to any of its<br/>tones. However, this tone is &quot;implicitly&quot; defined by the expectation<br/>that the major third g-b will be divided into two whole-tones g-a-b<br/>rather than a minor second and augmented second, e.g. g-ab-b.</p><p>In fact, a recognizable octave-species or trinality can often be<br/>conveyed by fewer than all eight tones, as this example in a trinality<br/>of G:</p><p>f&apos;-g&apos;   ^7-^8<br/>b -d&apos;   ^3-^5<br/>a -g    ^2-^1</p><p>(m6-8 + M2-5)</p><p>Here, although ^4 and ^6 are not explicitly sounded, the<br/>characteristic diminished fifth between ^3 and ^7 gives this<br/>progression a &quot;natural G-species&quot; quality. Note that here ^3 moves<br/>thirdwise to ^5, arriving at the fifth of the resolving trine.</p><p>Another example of &quot;implicit scale definition&quot; shows the alternative<br/>^3-^1 progression:</p><p>e&apos; f&apos;       ^7-^8<br/>b  c&apos;       ^4-^5<br/>a  f        ^3-^1</p><p>(M2-4)</p><p>Here the ascending semitonal progression ^4-^5 conveys a &quot;natural<br/>F-species&quot; quality. From another viewpoint, the known major third<br/>relationships a-f and e&apos;-c&apos; imply a-g-f and e&apos;-d&apos;-c&apos;, thus allowing us<br/>to recognize the octave-species despite the absence of ^2 and ^6.</p><p>Allowing for the vital and pervasive role of _unstable_ sonorities in<br/>defining a Gothic trinality, and the factor of &quot;implicit&quot; scale<br/>definition through such cues as major third relationships and tritonic<br/>intervals, the musical feeling of &quot;coverage&quot; in this music may be less<br/>problematic than one might guess on the basis of theories applying,<br/>for example, primarily to 5-limit or 7-limit music.</p><p>An actual Gothic piece, of course, will likely present more than one<br/>potential trinic center, just as a 5-limit piece typically features<br/>more than one potential triadic center. Sometimes it&apos;s easy to say<br/>&quot;this piece is obviously in the trinality of D (e.g. d-a-d&apos;),&quot; and in<br/>other cases the judgment may be much less clear, e.g. &quot;this piece<br/>gently oscillates between centers of f-c&apos;-f&apos; and g-d&apos;-g&apos;, finally<br/>settling on the latter.&quot; Each trinic center might typically be<br/>reinforced, at least temporarily, by cadencing to it from unstable<br/>sonorities.</p><p>This raises a final point: Gothic harmony features mostly conjunct or<br/>near-conjunct (thirdwise) melodic progressions in all voices -- or,<br/>from a vertical point of view, the resolution of unstable sonorities<br/>by conjunct or near-conjunct contrary motion. Thus while the system<br/>might be taken to fulfill Paul Erlich&apos;s property that &quot;[t]he majority<br/>of consonant chords have a root that lies a Q [fifth or fourth] away<br/>from the root of another consonant chord,&quot; conjunct or thirdwise<br/>motion in the lowest voice is more typical than _direct_ progressions<br/>between sonorities a fourth or fifth apart.</p><p>                                --------<br/>                                  Note<br/>                                --------</p><p>1. A reader familiar with the medieval modes may recognize that this<br/>vertical division of the octave into fifth and fourth is somewhat like<br/>the theoretical division of an octave-species into an authentic mode<br/>with lower fifth and upper fourth above the final (e.g. Mode I or<br/>Dorian, d-d&apos;), or a plagal mode with lower fourth below the final and<br/>upper fifth above it (e.g. Mode II or Hypodorian, A-a&apos; with final d).<br/>However, because the term &quot;mode&quot; for various medieval theorists such<br/>as Johannes de Grocheio implies not only an octave-species but a<br/>specific pattern of beginning, middle, and end for a melody, I have<br/>preferred in a polyphonic context as opposed to plainsong to speak of<br/>&quot;octave-species.&quot;</p><p>Most respectfully,</p><p>Margo Schulter<br/><a href="mailto:mschulter@value.net">mschulter@value.net</a></p></div><h3>Paul H.

She also discusses the concept of &quot;implicit<br/>scale definition&quot; as an alternative to &quot;coverage&quot;. It should be pointed<br/>out that only two tones, namely thos comprising the diminished fifth,<br/>are needed to identify the diatonic scale in any regular tuning other<br/>than 12-tET. In 12-tET, the diminished fifth is identical to the<br/>augmented fourth, so any one additional note is needed to identify the<br/>scale. My pentachordal decatonic scales in 22-tET contain a 10/22 oct.<br/>interval which is unique in each scale and thus serves to identify the<br/>scale unambiguously.</p></div>
