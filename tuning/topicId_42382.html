I<br/>suggested the project to the Harvard Group for New Music maybe 18 months<br/>ago, and a few other composers were keen to write for the combination.<br/>Unfortunately in the end, after the concert was postponed once last year,<br/>there are only two pieces to be played. I reluctantly had to withdraw mine<br/>due to another commission that interfered with the deadline. The two<br/>composers having pieces done are Bob Hasagewa and Chris Honnett, and as<br/>long as the space is available before the concert I&apos;ll be giving a little<br/>talk and demonstration at about 7:30 (I&apos;ll confirm onlist beforehand).<br/>There will be other new music on the program, don&apos;t know if any of it is<br/>microtonal though.</p><p>I notice there has been some discussion on the list about notating pitches<br/>as they sound, vs notating them how they&apos;d have to be &quot;fingered&quot; - in this<br/>case the two coincide. The performers read off regular notation (so they<br/>can practice on regularly tuned pianos if need be), and anyone looking at<br/>the score can identify the pitches intended.</p><p>I only know of Mandelbaum&apos;s scheme for 19 tones on two pianos, and this is<br/>slightly different, but the advantages seemed to outweigh the benefit of<br/>having it the same. In the future I guess it would be great if a standard<br/>emerged.</p><p>The following is a little description of the system as I envisaged it, for<br/>composers wondering whether to write for the combination. If I&apos;d been<br/>writing for a tuning-savvy audience I&apos;d have said things differently.</p><p>--[begin excerpt]--<br/>The 19-tone scale is written as follows:</p><p>C C# Db D D# Eb E E#/Fb F F# Gb G G# Ab A A# Bb B B#/Cb  (C...)</p><p>so the familiar white-note diatonic scale is preserved, but with two<br/>pitches where each black note would usually be (old enharmonic<br/>equivalences disappear: F# and Gb are now two distinct pitches, for<br/>example), and one new pitch between E and F (E#, alias Fb, a new<br/>enharmonic equivalence), and between B and C (B# or Cb). The 19 pitches<br/>are equally spaced within the octave.</p><p>Between the two pianos 24 notes are available per octave, and you<br/>only need 19. This means 5 can be duplicated.  My idea is to let the<br/>pianos share a pentatonic scale of C, D, F, G and A mapped onto the same<br/>keys on each piano. Then piano 1&apos;s 12-note scale would be as follows:</p><p>C C# D D# E F F# G G# A A# B</p><p>and piano 2&apos;s would be:</p><p>C Db D Eb Fb F Gb G Ab A Bb Cb</p><p>yielding all 19 pitches in combination.</p><p>Each pianist can thus play without having to learn new<br/>note-name/key-position associations (piano 2 has perhaps the harder job,<br/>with less obvious spellings like Fb and Cb).</p><p>Here are the tunings in Hertz for this system, given for the octave above<br/>middle C. This presumes leaving the note C unchanged from its usual tuning<br/>in an A 440 system; unfortunately _all_ the others, in both pianos, have<br/>to be moved-- some up and some down.  Other octaves would of course follow<br/>this pattern, and could be tuned from the central octave by eliminating<br/>beats.</p><p>Table of pitches in Hz</p><p>&quot;normally&quot;              PIANO 1                 PIANO 2</p><p>C       523.2           C       523.2           C       523.2<br/>B       494.0           B       486.4           B#/Cb   504.5<br/>Bb/A#   466.1           A#      452.2           Bb      469.0<br/>A       440.0           A       436.0           A       436.0<br/>G#/Ab   415.3           G#      405.3           Ab      420.4<br/>G       392.0           G       390.8           G       390.8<br/>F#/Gb   370.0           F#      363.3           Gb      376.8<br/>F       349.2           F       350.3           F       350.3<br/>E       329.6           E       325.6           E#/Fb   337.7<br/>Eb/D#   311.1           D#      302.7           Eb      314.0<br/>D       293.6           D       291.9           D       291.9<br/>C#/Db   277.2           C#      271.3           Db      281.4<br/>C       261.6           C       261.6           C       261.6</p><p>and here is a table of cents adjustments each piano needs on each note<br/>(the basic step of 19-tone music is 63.15 cents)</p><p>piano 1                   piano 2</p><p>C     0                   C     0<br/>C#  -37                   Db  +26<br/>D   -11                   D   -11<br/>D#  -47                   Eb  +16<br/>E   -21                   Fb  +42<br/>F   + 5                   F   + 5<br/>F#  -32                   Gb  +32<br/>G   - 5                   G   -5<br/>G#  -42                   Ab  +21<br/>A   -16                   A   -16<br/>A#  -53                   Bb  +11<br/>B   -26                   Cb  +37</p><p>These deviations could be somewhat adjusted across the board if necessary<br/>- as it is they are somewhat skewed towards the flat side (i.e. piano 1 is<br/>flatter than piano 2 is sharp). For example fixing the pitch G to its<br/>usual value, instead of C, all cents deviations would be adjusted<br/>sharpwards by 5 cents.</p><p>--[end excerpt]--</p><p>as it turns out, our tuner is actually going to be tuning a variety of<br/>1/3-comma meantone (by ear) instead, pretty much aurally indistinguishable<br/>from the equal-tempered version: I checked his practice tuning (he did a<br/>two-manual harpsichord, which was fun), and couldn&apos;t tell which of E#-G#<br/>or Db-Fb was intended as pure, they both sounded fine.</p><p>More info if anyone wants it!</p><p>Jon</p></div>
