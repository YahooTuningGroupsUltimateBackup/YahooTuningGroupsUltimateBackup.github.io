The URL is surely correct, and I<br/>cannot duplicate the problem of the Big File Download on Linux, NT, 98, or<br/>BeOS, but maybe it is because I am not on a modem. I have noticed that it<br/>cuts out, skips and plays at the wrong speed sometines though. Something<br/>is obviously awry, so when I return from work today, I am going to put the<br/>old show back on and reburn the CD.</p><p>John Starrett<br/>&quot;We have nothing to fear but the scary stuff.&quot;<br/><a href="http://www-math.cudenver.edu/~jstarret/microtone.html">http://www-math.cudenver.edu/~jstarret/microtone.html</a></p></div>
