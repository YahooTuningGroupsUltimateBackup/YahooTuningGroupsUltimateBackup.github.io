In which case there could be a problem with some of the conclusions drawn being<br/>suspect. The cheapest solution is of course, Csound. Doesn&apos;t have to be anything fancy for<br/>research purposes,  simple waveforms like Sawtooth, etc. or the Karplus-Strong &quot;Pluck&quot; sound&quot;.<br/>Oh, when looking up info on Csound, please start at the official site,<br/>&lt;<a href="http://mitpress.mit.edu/e-books/csound/frontpage.html">http://mitpress.mit.edu/e-books/csound/frontpage.html</a> &gt; You&apos;ll be better off.</p><p>Please correct me if I&apos;m wrong. Personally I can tell the difference between the cent<br/>approximations of my Yamaha&apos;s XG -64/+63 cent tuning tables &amp; precise pitches<br/>generated Csound. Not off-hand, of course, but if compared.</p><p>--<br/>_________________________________________________________</p><p>&#x9;Drew Skyfyre &lt;<a href="mailto:skyfyre@usa.net">skyfyre@usa.net</a>&gt;</p><p>&#x9;Peaches : Drew&apos;s Place in Cyberspace<br/>&#x9;featuring the web&apos;s only resource for Microtonal Guitar<br/>&#x9;&lt;<a href="http://www.geocities.com/Paris/Palais/8151/index.html">http://www.geocities.com/Paris/Palais/8151/index.html</a>&gt;</p><p>&#x9;&quot;Don&apos;t call me pure soul, it irritates me&quot;<br/>&#x9;- Judy Garland in The Pirate<br/>_________________________________________________________</p></div><h3>Daniel Wolf &#x3C;DJWOLF_MATERIAL@xxxxxxxxxx.xxxx&#x3E;</h3><span>4/26/1999 9:00:16 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>I&apos;m just back from New Hampshire, Connecticut, Mississippi and New Orleans<br/>(please don&apos;t ask why).

Are<br/>you using<br/>some method to actually accurately listen for &amp; hear the stuff you&apos;re<br/>talking about, or<br/>are you relying on the approimations of cent based tuning tables or<br/>pitch-bend<br/>implementations ?<br/>&lt;</p><p>This is an extremely important point. Whenever I come across statements<br/>about intonational perception or tolerance, a yellow caution light goes off<br/>in my head. Over the years, I have used (1) wave form generators,<br/>oscilloscopes and a frequency counter, (2) a Rayna double precision<br/>synth-in-box, (3)a wave form generator in Mathematica, and, most recently,<br/>(4) AcidWAV and WAVMaker. Whenever I have used the Rayna or the WAV<br/>programs and then made comparisons on standard midi instruments (either my<br/>sound card or a TX81Z), the midi instruments have always been strikingly<br/>out-of-tune, even in faster music with fewer sustained sounds. While the<br/>noise content in most midi instruments may be a contributing factor, my<br/>impression is that greater accuracy in the Rayna or WAV programs is<br/>perceptable.</p><p>On the other hand, when working with voices or acoustical instruments<br/>without fixed pitches, intonation acquires such dynamic and contextual<br/>qualities that my perception is qualitatively different. Thus, when using<br/>electronics, I want it as exact as possible, but when using voices in<br/>instruments, &apos;exactitude&apos; is very different.</p><p>Daniel Wolf<br/>Frankfurt</p></div>
