The performances I enjoyed most<br/>were all in the first half of the concert.</p><p>[Howard Rovics, TD 197.3]<br/>&gt; Greg Evans (perhaps the finest French horn player that I&apos;ve<br/>&gt; ever heard) was right there with the incomparable Anastasia<br/>&gt; Solberg on viola.</p><p>[David Beardsley, TD 198.<br/>&gt; The combined tone colors of Anastasia Solberg&apos;s viola and<br/>&gt; Greg Evans French Horn filled Columbia University&apos;s St. Paul&apos;s<br/>&gt; Chapel with Anton Rovner&apos;s quarter tone Appel a deux.</p><p>I too was very impressed with Greg&apos;s playing.  He coaxes<br/>microtonal pitches out of his horn with an apparent ease that<br/>is astonishing.  Anastasia&apos;s superb viola playing blended<br/>beautifully with it in the chapel&apos;s resonant space.</p><p>[Beardsley]<br/>&gt; The next set was performed by the virtuoso AFMM quartet of<br/>&gt; Andrew Bolotowsky, flute, Michiyo Suzuki, clarinet, Anastasia<br/>&gt; Solberg, viola and AFMM director Johnny Reinhard, bassoon.<br/>&gt; Four works, spanning almost a thousand years and showing<br/>&gt; extreme tuning techniques. From the anonymous Pythagorean<br/>&gt; Hymnus und Organum (1000) and Coimbra Manuscript (1500)<br/>&gt; to the more recent Free Music, V.2 (Percy Granger, 1939)<br/>&gt; and the more extreme 31tet of Ivan Wyschnegradsky&apos;s Etude<br/>&gt; Ultracromatique (1959) - this was an amazingly twisted<br/>&gt; programing decision. Also very good programing decision!</p><p>[Rovics]<br/>&gt; I&apos;m reminded of the Columbia Group for New Music days when<br/>&gt; Wuorinen and Sollberger would include an adaptation of Medieval<br/>&gt; music on each program for the purpose of reminding us that<br/>&gt; alternative approaches to rhythm, interval and formal<br/>&gt; organization have always existed.</p><p>I agree that the audacity of coupling these four so<br/>chronologically-separated works into one set was brilliantly<br/>carried out.  I was especially impressed by the two older pieces,<br/>particularly the Coimbra, with its very obviously microtonal<br/>melodic line.</p><p>[Beardsley]<br/>&gt; An early Harry Partch piece, Potion Scene (1931)<br/>&gt; was expertly performed by soprano Meredith Borden and violist<br/>&gt; Solberg. An amazing performance, there was no doubt that this<br/>&gt; was Partch!</p><p>This was perhaps the most emotionally affecting performance<br/>I&apos;ve yet seen at any AFMM concert.</p><p>The only criticism I have is that Meredith&apos;s vocals had too<br/>much of the &apos;operatic&apos; baggage (mainly vibrato and not-clear-enough<br/>enunciation of the actual words) that comes from her training,<br/>and which Partch abhorred.</p><p>But despite that, her and Anastasia&apos;s pitches were &apos;right on<br/>the money&apos;, and it was an outstanding and very dramatic performance.<br/>Anastasia sounded like Partch himself playing the adapted viola<br/>on his _Li-Po_ recordings.</p><p>Again, in spite of the not-entirely-Partchian vocal style, this<br/>was the highlight of the concert for me.  Meredith&apos;s performance<br/>had all the drama that an eloquent &apos;straight reading&apos; of<br/>Shakespeare would have had, but with the addition of a perfectly<br/>harmonized viola accompaniment.</p><p>It&apos;s a mystery to me why Partch abandoned this piece after<br/>writing it, as I think it was *very* effective in this rendition.</p><p>This year&apos;s AFMM made it clear that there are at least *two* great<br/>Partch vocalists in New York: Meredith Borden and Johnny Reinhard.</p><p>(see my review of Johnny&apos;s Microthon! performance of _Barstow_)<br/><a href="http://www.virtulink.com/immp/jux/AFMM10.htm">http://www.virtulink.com/immp/jux/AFMM10.htm</a></p><p>Joseph L.
