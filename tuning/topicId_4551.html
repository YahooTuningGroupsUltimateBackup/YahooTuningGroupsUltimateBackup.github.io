It doesn&apos;t give fine<br/>enough distinctions of consonance, and it implies a kind of idealism<br/>(as does n*d), whereby higher ratios are sometimes best interpreted<br/>as approximations to lower ones.  And there are still some cases in<br/>which, like n*d, it seems just plain wrong (3:5:9 more consonant than<br/>3:5:8?).  To give finer distinctions, you could find the GS and then<br/>take a ratio with a smaller LCM as being more consonant than a ratio<br/>with a larger one.  But even this wouldn&apos;t work in some cases (3:5:9<br/>more consonant than 12:15:20?), so I durno.  Never mind.  :P</p><p>Dale Scott</p><p>P.S. Does anybody know offhand the &quot;improved Euler method&quot; given by<br/>Martin Vogel in _On the Relations of Tone_?  I seem to remember it<br/>provided for finer distinctions of consonance (i.e., values of whole<br/>numbers with added decimal fractions) by taking into account things<br/>such as inversions and varying degrees of completeness of sonorities.</p></div><h3>Paul H.
