So it would need to be described as having no symbols<br/>differing only by accent marks.</p><p>The other nice feature about this symbol set would be of interest to<br/>those (like me) who want to use harmonics above 17.  The *exact*<br/>symbols for the 19-schisma (512:513), 19-comma (19456:19683), 23-<br/>comma (729:736), and 23S-diesis (16384:16767) are all in this set<br/>(for exact alternate spellings for harmonics and subharmonics 19 and<br/>23).</p><p>In the 612-ET-res symbol set (of 58 steps per apotome) I believe that<br/>we were taking the approach of using fewer flag combinations along<br/>with accents in order to arrive at a JI symbol set with a lower prime<br/>limit.  Instead of the 19-comma )|~ and 23S-diesis symbols ~|\, there<br/>would be symbols for the diaschisma ./| and meantone diesis .//|.</p><p>The 47-step high-precision JI notation happens to be *extremely*<br/>important to me, since I wish to notate high-prime-limit JI rather<br/>than extended 7, 11, or 13-limit JI.  If we have already gone to the<br/>trouble of defining exact symbols for 19C and 23S, then why can&apos;t I<br/>have a high-precision JI symbol set that provides them?</p><p>My objective is to provide composers who use different approaches to<br/>JI with symbol sets that will best accommodate their varying needs.<br/>I suspect that most performers won&apos;t want to read parts in high-<br/>precision JI and that these will end up being translated into medium-<br/>resolution athenian (or even lower-resolution spartan) level JI for<br/>performance (or with a little luck, perhaps 58-step JI can be done in<br/>such a way that, in most instances, it becomes athenian-level JI if<br/>the accent marks are ignored).  But the composer or theorist is apt<br/>to be more picky about using symbols that clearly convey the harmonic<br/>function of each tone, and these higher-resolution symbol sets are<br/>very useful for that purpose.</p><p>Part of the Sagittal philosophy is to provide plenty of versatility<br/>in the form of options that may be important to only a limited number<br/>of users, implementing these in such a way that they don&apos;t complicate<br/>matters for the majority of users, who are going to have little or no<br/>interest in those options.</p><p>Dave, we should let those who are reading this in-house debate of<br/>ours know that we haven&apos;t yet finalized our 58-step high-precision JI<br/>symbol set (whereas the 47-step one is fairly straightforward --<br/>almost a no-brainer!) and that this was the primary reason that we<br/>omitted any detailed discussion of high-precision JI in our XH18<br/>article.</p><p>--George</p></div>
