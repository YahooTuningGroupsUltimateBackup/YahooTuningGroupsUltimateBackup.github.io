From the discussion lead here, I<br/>supposed this was going to be performed in the way that (how should I call<br/>them?) &quot;Baroque orchestras&quot; tend to play music -- i.e. pitch of A4 = 415Hz,<br/>different intonation preferences and so on.</p><p>Johnny:  Hi Petr. This discussion is not about A=415 vs. A=440, etc.  There was no concept of absolute pitch that was universal at that time (although Sauveur did work out the principle in Paris).</p><p>There was a double standard of pitch centers, one tied to the organ pitch of the C, and the with a different C (played on strings and winds without organ).  The relationship between these two different C&apos;s were idiosyncratic to different places and different times.  They were called &quot;Chor&quot; (church) pitch and Kammer (chamber) pitch.</p><p>However, the discussion is about the relationship between the notes (intervals), which is the appropriate array of pitches (tuning), and how is the performance practice to service the tuning.</p><p>Petr:  I&apos;m realizing I was wrong. In<br/>fact, in the first movement of the 5th Brandenburg concerto, the minor<br/>seconds in the &quot;leading violin&quot; seem to be, as far as I can hear it, even<br/>smaller than in Pythagorean tuning. This is what I call the &quot;melodic&quot; way of<br/>intonation.</p><p>Johnny:  In the tuning of Werckmeister III, there are a total of 39 distinct musical intervals per octave.<br/>There are 4 different minor seconds, the smallest of which is 90 cents.  These different semitones &quot;obviously&quot; occur in different places in all of Bach&apos;s pieces, so there is a chromatic quality to all of the music.</p><p>Minor 2nds in Werckmeister III<br/>90:           C-Db, F-F#<br/>96:           Eb-E, G-G#, G#-A, Bb-B<br/>102:         C#-D, D-Eb<br/>108:         E-F, F#-G, A-Bb, B-C</p><p>Petr:  Interestingly, for this kind of music, I would prefer to use the<br/>opposite way of intonation (which I call the &quot;choral&quot; intonation) which is<br/>closer to meantone than to Pythagorean. Simply said, the minor seconds are<br/>too narrow for my ears. Maybe I&apos;ll need further explanation to understand<br/>what was the aim here.</p><p>Johnny:  Understood.  However, you are dealing with the music from a modern aesthetic.  I am fighting against this as a measuring approach.  I want to get to the heart of each composer.  To that end, I studied the tuning of Bach throughout my life (it was also my Masters thesis) to discover that Werckmeister III has been slimed by the musicological community.  My view is they don&apos;t hear it and they are hesitant to go against European myth as it applies to the modern 12-et and rationalizations for why it acheived tuning hegemony.</p><p>Hope this helps, Johnny<br/>________________________________________________________________________<br/>Check out the new AOL.

Simply sead, the<br/>minor seconds are too narrow for my ears. he wants *wider* minor 2nds<br/>&gt; and a more &apos;choral&apos; (i.e. just or meantoney) approach</p><p>- to which:</p><p>&gt; Johnny:  Understood. However, you are dealing with the music from a<br/>modern aesthetic.</p><p>??</p><p>The &apos;modern&apos; aesthetic is precisely narrow equal-ish semitones doing<br/>duty for minor seconds. This is what Petr says he dislikes!</p><p>Now looking at the table, you see that C#-D (most prominent in<br/>Brandenburg 5) is almost *exactly* equal to the equal-tempered<br/>semitone, and F#-G only a little larger. So who&apos;s on the side of<br/>&apos;modern&apos; / ET-like semitones here? I would imagine Petr happier with<br/>semitones around 112 or 114... which scarcely exist in well-temperaments.</p><p>&gt; I am fighting against this as a measuring approach.</p><p>Against what? In this case, Petr seems to think Werckmeister semitones<br/> *too near* ET!</p><p>&gt; Werckmeister III has been slimed by the musicological community.</p><p>I&apos;m not sure what this means. It&apos;s true that non-ET tunings were<br/>widely ignored or deprecated through much of the 20th century. If you<br/>only read musicologists up to 1970 or 1980, you might indeed get an<br/>idea of &apos;sliming&apos; - however, WIII was hardly worse treated than any<br/>other irregular temperament. If you mean Isacoff ... well, I don&apos;t<br/>think anyone should call him a musicologist.</p><p>The main opposition to irregular tunings recently has been from<br/>pianists and piano tuners!!</p><p>Now in the last few decades musicology has become very much interested<br/>in them (see Lindley as early as 1977). In fact, according to what<br/>people say in the harpsichord discussion group I post to, in the last<br/>couple of decades WIII became a fixture in discussions of Bach tuning,<br/>and has often been used in recordings. So any sense of<br/>Werckmeister-martyrdom is misplaced. Putting harpsichords in WIII has<br/>been done for a long time.</p><p>However, not everyone who has advocated irregular tunings has been an<br/>unequivocal supporter of WIII. Suppose that someone prefers something<br/> of Bendeler or Neidhardt or Kirnberger for Bach. Does that mean still<br/>&apos;sliming&apos; WIII?</p><p>&gt; My view is they don&apos;t hear it</p><p>... Or perhaps, nowadays, they heard too much of it, if WIII was used<br/>as a &apos;default&apos; harpsichord tuning. As a harpsichordist I don&apos;t like it<br/>so much in chords like D major (fifth too flat relative to the third)<br/>B major (third too sharp, fifth too flat) and Ab major (Pythagorean<br/>chords run amok). That was, actually, how I got started in this whole<br/>business, trying to get something sounding a bit better than WIII on<br/>my instrument. My main objection has been that the flat fifths are too<br/>much of a sacrifice if none of the thirds are pure. To obtain a major<br/>third such as WIII has at C-E, I would rather tune 1/5-comma between<br/>these notes.</p><p>Most &apos;historically-informed-performance&apos; people I know of have been<br/>aware of tuning questions for some time now. (Which doesn&apos;t<br/>necessarily mean they either love or hate WIII...)</p><p>~~~T~~~</p></div>
