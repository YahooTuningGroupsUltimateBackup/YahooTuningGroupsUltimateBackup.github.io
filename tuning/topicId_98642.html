It&apos;s improper, but not horrendously so (small step is 2 degrees of 28, large is 5), and that&apos;s actually what allows 11/10 and 5/4 to share an interval class.  Does this temperament have a name?  If not, it should, because it&apos;s really cool.</p><p>-Igs</p></div><h3>genewardsmith &#x3C;genewardsmith@...&#x3E;</h3><span>4/26/2011 1:33:44 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;cityoftheasleep&quot; &lt;igliashon@...&gt; wrote:</p><p>&gt; Does this temperament have a name?
