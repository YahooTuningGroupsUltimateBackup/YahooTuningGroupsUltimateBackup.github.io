But seriously, wasn&apos;t this in itself<br/>a bit of a &quot;specialized&quot; question, i.e., one pertaining to those who<br/>had had some experience playing (or were knowledgeable about) the<br/>violin?</p><p>&gt; I think the jabs and the exclusive math stuff  should be sent<br/>privately.</p><p>I agree with the first part, but who&apos;s to say what&apos;s &quot;exclusive&quot; when<br/>it comes to &quot;math stuff?&quot; And &quot;privately&quot; would mean what? That Paul<br/>Erlich (or whomever) send their &quot;exclusive math stuff&quot; via private<br/>email to ?  Maybe what your saying is that you&apos;d prefer a separate<br/>list for the more technically, or theoretically oriented end of the<br/>tuning discussion? Though I REALLY don&apos;t think that that&apos;s necessary,<br/>maybe (just maybe) it would help clear up some of these problems...</p><p>Dan</p></div><h3><a id=5379 href="#5379">ðŸ”—</a>Dale Scott &#x3C;adelscott@xxxx.xxxxxx.xxxx&#x3E;</h3><span>Invalid Date Invalid Date</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>&gt;From: &quot;patrick pagano&quot; &lt;<a href="mailto:ppagano@bellsouth.net">ppagano@bellsouth.net</a>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;I wish all you fellas could get behind responding to a tuning item or topic<br/>&gt;that is not overly mathematical or overly theorist  but practical. .This<br/>list &gt;is denigrating via overly mathematical elitism AND petty squabbles.<br/>&gt;I think the jabs and the exclusive math stuff  should be sent privately.<br/>&gt;Thanks<br/>&gt;Pat</p><p>Without speculative music theory (and yes, much of this is painfully<br/>mathematical--that&apos;s the nature of the beast) to back it up, what &quot;practical&quot;<br/>advice can anyone give about tuning?
