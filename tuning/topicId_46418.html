But in general, yes.</p><p>&gt;Any idea?<br/>&gt;  &gt;<br/>The comment to figure 3 says &quot;There are no peaks in Figure 2 at intervals corrsponding to the reciprocals of integers &gt;6, reflecting the paucity of amplitude maxima at harmonic numbers &gt;6.&quot;  I&apos;m not sure if this is saying that the resonant peak is never at the 7th partial (Figure 3A shows a small amount of energy there) but 8:7 and 9:7 are ruled out.  6:11 would actually be the next simplest ratio with a denominator of 6.  So perhaps we can adjust that claim to &gt;=6?  The 6th harmonic is certainly weaker than the 5th, yet 6:5 isn&apos;t apparent in the female graph.</p><p>                             Graham</p></div><h3><a id=46480 href="#46480">ðŸ”—</a>Paul Erlich &#x3C;perlich@aya.yale.edu&#x3E;</h3><span>8/20/2003 3:46:41 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;Martin Braun&quot; &lt;nombraun@t...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt; Paul:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; why is it a peculiarity? 7:4 and 7:5 are the simpler of these<br/>ratios<br/>&gt; &gt; by most measures. and even if you assume total octave equivalence,<br/>&gt; &gt; 9:7 is still more complex than the other four you mentioned.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; also, i&apos;ve noticed that sometimes an infinitesimal change in the<br/>&gt; &gt; numerical method can change a small peak into a small trough, or<br/>vice<br/>&gt; &gt; versa. it might be interesting to reproduce their studies with<br/>&gt; &gt; simulated, rather than real, sounds, to see what results.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Thanks, Paul.
