Check it out. Let me know if you can&apos;t find it.</p><p>My calculator gives 11/7 a value of 0.88 (anything above zero should be good) and I&apos;ve tested it and to me it sounds okay. If you remember I used to think that 6/5 was the narrowest legal interval. I tried a 9/8 interval using a Church Organ voice a few weeks ago and realised I had been wrong all along (I had been using the wrong voice for testing). Try the 11/7 with different voices and you might change your opinion of it (note that I&apos;m open to the idea that my calculator might be wrong and should return a negative value for 11/7). So far, with v7 of the calc it seems consistent. If anyone out there can find any anomalies with the calculator please let me know.</p><p>John.</p><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, Michael &lt;djtrancendance@...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;&quot;Did you play the MP3 that demonstrates the M scale?
