Play a loud noise every n seconds,<br/>and rats eventually learn to ignore it.  Play the noise at<br/>random intervals, and over time rats show abnormal behavior<br/>indicative of high stress.  Now, ads may or may not stress<br/>you out as much as loud noise, but I&apos;d interpret this result<br/>by saying that random stimuli are harder to ignore.</p><p>There are many takes on the advertising-supported issue.<br/>I&apos;m recommending: NEVER click on these ads.  If you see<br/>something you want, open a new window and get it through<br/>Google.</p><p>It&apos;s misleading to say that &quot;Yahoo groups is an advertiser<br/>supported service.&quot;  They are x thousand people using this<br/>service.  It isn&apos;t going away.  How much of your time have<br/>you spent clicking through ads lately (how much network<br/>bandwidth have you invested in downloading them)?  Thirty<br/>seconds -- a minute?  How much do you get paid for your<br/>time (how much would you charge if someone wanted you to<br/>look at ads for an hour)?  How much could it possibly cost<br/>to run this service (keep in mind they provide no on-line<br/>support)?  Do the math.  The service isn&apos;t going anywhere.</p><p>-Carl</p></div>
