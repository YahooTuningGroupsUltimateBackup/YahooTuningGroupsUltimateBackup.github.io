Unfortunately, the only part of it that<br/>has been published so far is a small excerpt from my article<br/>on Boethius&apos;s illustration of Greek notation, which appears<br/>in my book.</p><p>I have two webpages which do touch on some of the subjects<br/>you mention here:</p><p>Tutorial on Ancient Greek Tetrachord Theory<br/><a href="http://www.ixpres.com/interval/monzo/aristoxenus/tutorial.htm">http://www.ixpres.com/interval/monzo/aristoxenus/tutorial.htm</a></p><p>The Measurement of Aristoxenus&apos;s Divisions of the Tetrachord<br/><a href="http://www.ixpres.com/interval/monzo/aristoxenus/318tet.htm">http://www.ixpres.com/interval/monzo/aristoxenus/318tet.htm</a></p><p>Please note that the Aristoxenus page is unfinished, does<br/>not even touch on a new interpretation I&apos;ve arrived at for<br/>Aristoxenus&apos;s tetrachords, and badly needs editing.</p><p>Anyway, hope you find them useful.  The Tutorial should<br/>help answer many of your questions.</p><p>Concerning the bit about &apos;how enharmonic effects became<br/>&quot;over-used&quot; by some kithara players&apos;, please see my<br/>tuning list post of :  Wed Dec 15, 1999  6:46 pm<br/><a href="/tuning/topicId_6865.html#6947">/tuning/topicId_6865.html#6947</a></p><p>-monz<br/><a href="http://www.monz.org">http://www.monz.org</a><br/>&quot;All roads lead to n^0&quot;</p><p>_________________________________________________________<br/>Do You Yahoo!?<br/>Get your free <a href="https://twitter.com/yahoo">@yahoo</a>.com address at <a href="http://mail.yahoo.com">http://mail.yahoo.com</a></p></div><h3><a id=26187 href="#26187">ðŸ”—</a>Ed Borasky &#x3C;znmeb@aracnet.com&#x3E;</h3><span>7/13/2001 10:50:35 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In tuning@y..., &quot;Mats &Ouml;ljare&quot; &lt;oljare@h...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt; The New Oxford History of Music,part I is some interesting reading<br/>on<br/>&gt; ancient Greek and Arabic music,being unusually detailed in<br/>describing the<br/>&gt; different kinds of intonations used.There are some great diagrams<br/>of<br/>&gt; frettings for some kind of stringed instruments that i will try to<br/>analyze<br/>&gt; and perhaps compose something with later.</p><p>Yes, I have this one (Volume I) and also Volume II (400 - 1300 CE).<br/>Volume II has quite a section on Byzantine music, which is why I<br/>bought it.
