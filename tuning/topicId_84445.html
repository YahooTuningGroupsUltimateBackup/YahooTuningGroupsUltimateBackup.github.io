It reminds me a keyboard used in one old electronic magazine for DIY analog electronic organ, where it was called &quot;Herold keyboard&quot; (maybe I can dig it somewhere from my archives and scan). That one had three rows of keys only, and it had nothing to do with microtones - adjacent keys just played whole tone scales. Middle keyboard from C, lower and upper keyboard from Db (last two manuals were mechanically joined to make fingering easier).</p><p>As the keyboard in the picture has more manuals, it can be used for microtonal music, for EDO based on number 6, like 24, 30, 36... I&apos;m quite sure the owner of that firm will answer questions about it. I wonder if it&apos;s only mechanical or if it has electronic contacts and guts, offering MIDI output.</p><p>Daniel Forro</p><p>On 23 Aug 2009, at 2:46 PM, clumma wrote:</p><p>&gt;<br/>&gt; I wonder which instrument is pictured here!<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; <a href="http://www.laukhuff.de/en/keyboards/products/special-keyboards.html">http://www.laukhuff.de/en/keyboards/products/special-keyboards.html</a><br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; -Carl<br/>&gt;</p></div>
