Finnamore wrote,</p><p>&lt;&lt; The key to 13 EDO (Equal Divisions of the Octave, since we seem to<br/>have a few newbies posting :-), in my experience, is to emphasize<br/>thirds and to minimize fourths and fifths. &gt;&gt;</p><p>The main scale I used in &quot;With Eyes so Blue and Dreaming&quot; is 0 3 4 6 7<br/>9 11 13. And though this was yet another purely ear derived scale, the<br/>nice 11 and 13th (and the &apos;not so nice&apos; 3rd) harmonic approximations<br/>did jump right out at me, and if one wanted to look at it as a<br/>consistent temperament of sorts one could actually call it a harmonic<br/>series subset of 1/1 19/16 5/4 11/8 23/16 13/8 29/16 2/1. But this is<br/>not the way I approached it at all -- it was the augmented second<br/>scale-step that really fired me up with this scale. That particular<br/>melancholic ache that I associate with many eastern European scales is<br/>very<br/>vividly recast in this scale.</p><p>Most all the 11 and 13 equal scales that I use have an &apos;exotic&apos; scale<br/>quality (and I mean this in the traditional &quot;Hungarian major&quot; etc.<br/>sense), where the unfamiliar proportions and alignments of 11 and 13<br/>equal add something special to the equation. When I said crude but<br/>effective yesterday, this sticking to a simple scale is what I meant.<br/>So in other words a simple &apos;modal&apos; approach where the unusualness of<br/>the tuning supplies enough complexity to make the whole not seem quite<br/>as straightforward as it actually is. (I also will often use different<br/>1/1s as way to heighten the interest/tension/complexity as well, as is<br/>the case with some of the ensemble in &quot;With Eyes so Blue and<br/>Dreaming&quot;. This too is &quot;crude but effective&quot;, and a favorite and much<br/>used structural device of mine.)</p><p>&lt;&lt; A fun way to approximate 13 and get a feel for it was discussed<br/>here some time ago.  On a guitar with a movable bridge, move it back<br/>and slant it until you get octaves on the 13th fret on each string. &gt;&gt;</p><p>Yes, I&apos;ve used this too, and it&apos;s quick but increasingly dirty, and<br/>dirty = inaccurate here, the farther you get from the bridges original<br/>position (Paul Erlich posted the math for this a while back, but I&apos;ve<br/>forgotten it now... anyone care to spell it out again?).</p><p>About 8 or 9 years ago now, I had an old Kay Jumbo loaner for a while,<br/>and you could actually push the bridge up towards the soundhole until<br/>you had the octave just about at the 10th fret, and all the way back<br/>until you had the octave nearly at the 15th fret -- way cool! This<br/>guitar in various bridge positions appears in many places on my piece<br/>&quot;Day Walks In&quot;.</p><p>--Dan Stearns</p></div>
