You don&apos;t really need to add a quadratic term or even a linear<br/>&gt; term to get the areas above and below zero to be the same, a constant<br/>&gt; would suffice.

I might add the option to switch the linears or quadratics off<br/>or choose what type of compensation you want to use (maybe<br/>even to make the slope continuous at the endpoints too for<br/>the quarter and complete wave ones). Or inded could add<br/>in square waves, saw tooth curves, and pulses as functions that the user<br/>can use, e.g. H(a,b) = 1 between a and b and 0 outside it or<br/>S(a,b) slopes from 0 to 1 betwen a and b. P(a,b) goes<br/>from 0 to 1 at midpoint of a,b then back again to 0<br/>- or some such, will have to think about it.</p><p>The reason for doing it like this is<br/>just that the discontinuous ones tend to be a bit harsh on the ear and<br/>probably most users will want something a bit more melodious<br/>than say a pure saw or square wave.
