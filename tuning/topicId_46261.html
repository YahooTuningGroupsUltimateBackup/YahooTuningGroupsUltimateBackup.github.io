If you have just a<br/>single modulator-carrier-pair and broad and fast changes in the<br/>modulation index I would most often describe this quality as<br/>irritating. Something to do with those bouncing Bessel functions I<br/>guess. But with more complex algorithms the results get much better.<br/>One simple but effective algorithm is three pairs of modulator-<br/>carrier with different ratios. Good bell and electric piano sounds<br/>come out of this configuration. And FM is a bliss with bass sounds.</p><p>FM7 has completely programmable matrix for programming your own<br/>algorithms. Yamaha FM synths have preprogrammed algorithms. It has<br/>six operators (TX81z has only four) with 32 different waveforms.<br/>Every operator can be both a modulator and a carrier and anyone of<br/>them can modulate itself in feedback (only one with Yamaha products).<br/>Ratios can be set with 4 decimals and the operators can be detuned<br/>with Hz offset. In addition FM7 has dual filters and distortion unit<br/>with a noise source. The operators, pitch, filter and distortion have<br/>all loopable envelopes with 31 breakpoints. It has also quite good<br/>programmable effects section which can do delay, pseudo reverb,<br/>chorusing and flanging type effects. With all this and more its sound<br/>capabilities go way beyond any previous commercial implementation of<br/>FM.</p><p>And most importantly: registered users can download an update with<br/>the ability to load Midi Tuning Standard files (you can create them<br/>with Scala) as SysEx into the machine. I&apos;m not sure about the tuning<br/>resolution though. It has a 12-tone microtuning section which seems<br/>to have a one cent resolution but my listening experiments indicate<br/>that it goes much beyond that in the SySex mode.</p><p>Kalle</p></div><h3><a id=46308 href="#46308">ðŸ”—</a>Carl Lumma &#x3C;ekin@lumma.org&#x3E;</h3><span>8/8/2003 1:46:42 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>&gt;I can&apos;t say I haven&apos;t heard of sinusoidal modelling of noise being<br/>&gt;done, but someone indicated to me that most music can be approximated<br/>&gt;extremely well using FFT of surprisingly limited frequency resolution,</p><p>If you have Wendy Carlos&apos; *Digital Moonscapes*, you can hear what<br/>was possible in the early 80&apos;s with the GDS Synergy -- a box capable<br/>of, IIRC, 16 simultaneous partials.

So I don&apos;t know directly, but I have heard that argument.  Since<br/>&gt; pitch is so important here I&apos;ll try to learn more about this, and report<br/>&gt; back if I find anything interesting.</p><p>Oh, yes, if you use FFTs you can reproduce any sound.  I was thinking of literally adding together a set of sine wave generators.  And I remember producing fractal noise using FFTs on a 486, faster than the duration of the resulting files, so it must be possible in real time on modern equipment.</p><p>Noise patches will require more resolution than most music.</p><p>&gt;&gt;In addition, the result probably depends on the sample<br/>&gt;&gt;rate and depth of the original, so mathematical predictions won&apos;t be<br/>&gt;&gt;enough, and you may as well use samples.<br/>&gt; &gt; I don&apos;t follow this.</p><p>You can theoretically predict the harmonic structure of FM timbres using Bessel functions.  So that would be your meta-algorithm for additive synthesis.  But for noise patches, the partials are still significant up to a high number.  Anything approaching or exceeding the sample rate will alias, which you also have to model.  Perhaps that can be done by bouncing below the Nyquist frequency, but I suspect the only way to reproduce a particular FM implementation would be to model it exactly and do an inverse FFT.  If you can do that, you&apos;re really doing FM or sampling, and the additive bit doesn&apos;t save you anything.</p><p>&gt;&gt;Also, as FM in practice includes AM there are no inherent restrictions.<br/>&gt;&gt;The TX81Z itself has all kinds of restrictions, because of what was<br/>&gt;&gt;practical at the time it was made.  If you&apos;ve got enough power to<br/>&gt;&gt;implement 100 additive sine waves, you can also implement 100 FM<br/>&gt;&gt;operators.<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; This might not be true if you use FFT to generate the sine waves, though I<br/>&gt; haven&apos;t thought deeply about it.</p><p>Yes, I think you&apos;re right.  When the complexity gets into thousands, FFTs will be more efficient than FM synthesis.  FM is more efficient for small numbers of operators.</p><p>&gt; I would expect that even without using FFT, a state-of-the-art computer<br/>&gt; would now be capable of 10,000 or more simultaneous sine waves.  I&apos;m doing<br/>&gt; 500 or so simulataneous (very simple) physical model instances on a dual<br/>&gt; 1GHz G4, and that is severely limited by memory access, whereas sinusoidal<br/>&gt; would not have that problem, and is also generally much simpler (per<br/>&gt; oscillator), so I give it at least another factor of 10 for 5000<br/>&gt; simultaneous sines, and therefore at least 10,000 on the soon-to-release<br/>&gt; dual 2GHz G5.  Of course parameters controlling the sine waves in real time<br/>&gt; would add a bit to this, but still, it would be a lot.  Not that this isn&apos;t<br/>&gt; a very expensvie route (at the moment), but you may not need the latest<br/>&gt; hardware to get what is needed.</p><p>10,000 sines over 128 voices is only 78 sines per voice.  So there are still practical limits, but a TX81Z will run out first.  You may want to add reverb, chorus, etc, but that would only be a linear increase.</p><p>Kyma advertises 192 sine waves (with independent envelopes) for a basic system and 1743 fully loaded.  That&apos;s old hardware, so the orders of magnitude are correct.</p><p>I could try resynthesising a TX patch with 78 sines to see how well it does come out.  I&apos;ve a feeling it won&apos;t work because of the analysis overhead.</p><p>&gt; I would think the alternative might be Additive with better abstractions (as<br/>&gt; you said &quot;meta-algorithm&quot;).  Try to match the terse functionality of FM,<br/>&gt; with perhaps just a couple more voicing options that would affect how the<br/>&gt; frequency spectrum &quot;blooms&quot;.  I think FM often blooms wrong.</p><p>If you can come up with such abstractions.  I don&apos;t think anybody has with results much better than FM.  But then I don&apos;t know of any soft synths with 10,000 sinusoids, so perhaps you&apos;re onto something there.</p><p>                 Graham</p></div><h3><a id=46328 href="#46328">ðŸ”—</a>Carl Lumma &#x3C;ekin@lumma.org&#x3E;</h3><span>8/8/2003 11:51:54 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>&gt;Kyma advertises 192 sine waves (with independent envelopes) for a basic<br/>&gt;system and 1743 fully loaded.
