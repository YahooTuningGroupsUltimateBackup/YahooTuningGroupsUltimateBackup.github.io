I&apos;ve heard of him. He&apos;s one of the terra verde piano<br/>  players. Terra verde is a fairly recent new genre of piano music<br/>  which is reminiscent of some of Jelly Roll Morton&apos;s more exotic<br/>  pieces. Piano scores, CD&apos;s and a bunch of free midis are available<br/>  at</p><p>  <a href="http://www.ragtime.nu/terraverde/index.html">http://www.ragtime.nu/terraverde/index.html</a></p><p>  I have been a longtime fan of ragtime and I regard terra verde as<br/>  an exciting new development. It is interesting to note that this<br/>  website sells original piano music folios which is something of<br/>  a rarity in this day and age of recorded music.</p></div>
