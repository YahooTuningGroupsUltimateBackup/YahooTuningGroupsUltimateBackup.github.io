Because I&apos;m not the guy. :)</p><p>&gt; &gt; I think it&apos;s once again the resolving tritone that makes this a nice<br/>&gt; &gt; resolution. Of course the Db-C adds to the voice leading. But note<br/>&gt; &gt; that this tritone substitution sounds noticeably less strong than V7-<br/>&gt; &gt; I. So this example doesn&apos;t really refute the effect of scale<br/>&gt; &gt; structure. It may even support it, F and B are still members of the<br/>&gt; &gt; scale.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; It doesn&apos;t sound less strong to me at all, if anything it sounds even<br/>&gt; stronger.</p><p>OK.</p><p>&gt; Tritone subs can really strengthen resolutions when thrown in at the<br/>&gt; right time.</p><p>Sure, they are cool.</p><p>&gt; &gt; &gt; But check out the sLssLss mode of mavila[7], which has major chords<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; at I, IV, and V - V still resolves to one really nicely. Check out<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; some mavila comma pumps in this scale - let&apos;s call the notes<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; C D E F G A B C for sLssLss.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; I hear them resolving only weakly at best.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Well, if you spend some more time with them, maybe you&apos;ll hear them<br/>&gt; resolving more strongly.</p><p>I heard C D A C -&gt; C E G C as pretty strong though. It&apos;s interesting<br/>as the D-A is a sharp fifth, all others are flat. In TOP Mavila it&apos;s<br/>coincidentally relatively well tuned too.</p><p>&gt; But who says chords have to come from scales to begin with?<br/>&gt; What about the blues?</p><p>They don&apos;t have to. But when they do, the scale structure can have<br/>some influence on how the harmony is heard. That&apos;s all.</p><p>&gt; &gt; &gt; Check out Cmaj -&gt; Em -&gt; Bm -&gt; Fmaj, where the Bm -&gt; Fmaj ends up being<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; motion by 3/2 because of the mavila tempering. The Fmaj -&gt; Cmaj still<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; sounds like a plagal cadence. Or try | Cmaj | Fmaj Gmaj | Bm | Gmaj<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; Fmaj | Cmaj |. Interesting stuff going on here.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; Can&apos;t really say if it sounds like a plagal cadence to me, maybe not.<br/>&gt; &gt; | Cmaj | Fmaj Gmaj | Bm | Gmaj Fmaj | Cmaj | sounds quite like a<br/>&gt; &gt; modulation!<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Modulation in what sense?</p><p>When I play it so that the first Cmaj and the last are voiced in<br/>different inversions, I hear as if the key has changed. Surely it is<br/>the comma pump playing tricks on me!</p><p>&gt; &gt; &gt; Sure, the same applies for a single bass voice.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; Then I think the reason is conditioning. Or can you think of a<br/>&gt; &gt; psychoacoustic reason why a descending fifth should sound like a<br/>&gt; &gt; resolution and an ascending fifth shouldn&apos;t (when you hear the center<br/>&gt; &gt; note as the key center)?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; What&apos;s the &quot;center&quot; note in this case? There&apos;s only a lower and an<br/>&gt; upper note.</p><p>I meant like if the center is C then the fifth ascends from F and<br/>descends from G.</p><p>&gt; And even if it is conditioning, so what?

In the meantime, it turns<br/>out that I can latch onto Keemun[7] almost instantly, so what happened<br/>to learning?

So let me<br/>&gt; ask: can you think of a psychoacoustic reason why a fifth descending<br/>&gt; to the tonic should sound like a stronger resolution than a fifth<br/>&gt; ascending to the tonic?</p><p>We&apos;re discussing something that blends psychoacoustics and learning<br/>together, so I don&apos;t know where one ends and the other begins. I think<br/>it might have to do with comma pumps - I note that Gmaj -&gt; Cmaj only<br/>sounds strong if the Cmaj is established as the tonic. If you&apos;re in G<br/>mixolydian, Fmaj -&gt; Cmaj -&gt; Gmaj sounds like it&apos;s resolving to Gmaj,<br/>and you can flip your brain around to hear it either way. However, I<br/>note that a surefire way to get yourself to hear it as C major is Dm7<br/>-&gt; Gmaj -&gt; Cmaj, which is interesting because now you&apos;ve blended the<br/>subdominant and the dominant together with this tempered D, so you can<br/>run around in a tempered circle. G7 -&gt; C does the same thing, but<br/>smushed into one chord.</p><p>Furthermore, just to throw out some shameless wild speculation that I<br/>can&apos;t support at all, G7 is almost certainly related to some kind of<br/>perception of 4:5:6:7, so perhaps that&apos;s another level of comma<br/>pumping on top of it. This would mean that C is an otonal interval on<br/>top of F which is an otonal interval on top of G which is an otonal<br/>interval on top of C. But that&apos;s more speculative.</p><p>I had some interesting examples worked out in mavila, but then my<br/>computer crashed and I lost them all. I remember they were vaguely<br/>built around the comma pump Cmaj-Gmaj-Dmaj-Fm, where the F#-A from the<br/>Dmaj and the F-Ab from the Fm are actually the same thing. The whole<br/>thing fits into a single mavila[7] and is the anti-diatonic<br/>counterpart of Cm-Gm-Dm-Fmaj. I&apos;ll come up with some examples soon.</p><p>-Mike</p></div><h3>Mike Battaglia &#x3C;battaglia01@...&#x3E;</h3><span>5/19/2011 5:33:42 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>On Mon, May 16, 2011 at 11:10 AM, Mike Battaglia &lt;battaglia01@...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; The tritone hypothesis, which I&apos;ve usually seen mentioned at the same<br/>&gt; time as the rare interval hypothesis, is that the one &quot;rare&quot; size of<br/>&gt; fifth is the diminished fifth, and it lies adjacent to the Aeolian and<br/>&gt; Ionian modes.

Although<br/>everyone knows that in mavila, going up the circle of fifths gets you<br/>to a bunch of minor stuff, I never really considered before that going<br/>up the circle of fourths consequently puts you at the major side of<br/>the spectrum. So you end up getting things like C-F-B-E, where F-B is<br/>also an approximate 4/3.</p><p>So you can play chords like Cmaj -&gt; Fmaj -&gt; Bm -&gt; Em, again where F-B<br/>is a 4/3.

The fact that we can&apos;t do nice voice leading from the<br/>iv-I might have something to do with it, which would validate your<br/>point about the voice leading being involved.

I think that the natural minor cadence D B F A -<br/>A C E A could have been adopted but history progressed differently.<br/>The semitonal motion to the &quot;tonic&quot; note in cadences has been a<br/>feature of the Western musical tradition since the 13th century.</p><p>&gt; 2) Harmonic minor has more to do with tonal minor harmony than<br/>&gt; Aeolian, and in general V7-I and V7-i are what took precedence for<br/>&gt; tonal harmony, even if that meant using more than one scale (like the<br/>&gt; three minor scales)<br/>&gt; 3) I have never seen any evidence put out there to support this idea<br/>&gt; 4) Being as this list usually strongly discourages finding<br/>&gt; numerological patterns in scales (like the &quot;Deep scale&quot; property), I&apos;m<br/>&gt; surprised that people sometimes cite this as if it has explanatory<br/>&gt; power<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; So when you talked about the &quot;rare interval&quot; thing I assumed you were<br/>&gt; talking about that. Perhaps I misunderstood.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; As for rare intervals aiding position finding in a scale, the concept<br/>&gt; of which you call innocuous - yes, I agree, that&apos;s innocuous enough,<br/>&gt; but that&apos;s not what I thought you were saying. I thought you said that<br/>&gt; leading tones &quot;resolved&quot; because they were the rare intervals in the<br/>&gt; major scale.</p><p>I mentioned it in the context of wondering why leading tones work the<br/>way they do, if it is simply the pitch proximity and/or some other<br/>reason.</p><p>&gt; So then I have to ask, if you&apos;re playing C harmonic<br/>&gt; minor, the Ab-B is now the &quot;rare interval.&quot; Are we now to believe that<br/>&gt; Ab-B is going to resolve to Cm/maj7 more strongly than B-C will<br/>&gt; resolve to Cm, because Ab-B is twice as rare as B-C in the scale? Or<br/>&gt; how about Melodic minor #4 - C D Eb F# G A B C - am I to believe that<br/>&gt; the F#-Eb resolution will now be stronger than the F#-G or the B-C?</p><p>The augmented second is a rare interval but it&apos;s not a characteristic<br/>dissonance in Paul&apos;s sense because seconds are not consonances. The<br/>characteristic dissonance idea is not quite the same as the rare<br/>interval hypothesis as far as I know.</p><p>&gt; &gt; &gt; I&apos;ll just leave it at that Pajara, which is based on this thinking,<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; doesn&apos;t work for me. The &quot;rare intervals&quot; in Pajara that are supposed<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; to act as &quot;signposts&quot; don&apos;t signal things as they&apos;re supposed to in my<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; perception.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; I think the following progression signals the tonic just fine:<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; <a href="http://soundcloud.com/kalleaho/a-progression-in-standard">http://soundcloud.com/kalleaho/a-progression-in-standard</a><br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; It sounds cool, but I&apos;m a little bit lost. What is the tonic? It ends<br/>&gt; on what sounds like the 22-equal equivalent of B D# F G#, so does that<br/>&gt; mean the tonic is supposed to be G#m6? Which is of course<br/>&gt; exceptionally hip because it&apos;s the 7-limit utonality.</p><p>Yes.</p><p>&gt; But no, to me this doesn&apos;t signal a tonic, whereas the porcupine<br/>&gt; functional excerpt I made did. But whatever you did was cool, perhaps<br/>&gt; I just have to learn to hear the logic in it.</p><p>Actually the first half of the progression ends in a bass movement<br/>from &quot;subdominant&quot; (the scale degree) to tonic and the latter half<br/>ends in a bass movement from &quot;dominant&quot; to tonic. I thought you said<br/>that these mere bass movements sound plagal and authentic to you, so<br/>why not in this case?</p><p>The progression simply visits all the 7-limit tetrads of the scale<br/>(and some intermediate chords too) and the penultimate chord contains<br/>the characteristic dissonance that resolves in contrary motion<br/>(that&apos;s the Erlich-y part of the progression). (It also contains ~9:7<br/>which is also a characteristic dissonance in Paul&apos;s theory, that<br/>resolves in oblique motion.) Perhaps that chord should have been held<br/>longer to really hear the characteristic dissonance(s).</p><p>I hear the pentachordal minor tonic as the tonic and I hear two<br/>cadences in this progression.</p><p>I&apos;m pretty sure other modes of pentachordal (and probably<br/>symmetrical) decatonic can be tonicized in some way too but are the<br/>pentachordal major and minor really the most tonal as Paul&apos;s theories<br/>suggest? I don&apos;t know.</p><p>&gt; &gt; &gt; How so?<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; If you think about a typical intelligible melody it&apos;s not just a<br/>&gt; &gt; succession of sounds, it&apos;s actually heard as a movement through pitch<br/>&gt; &gt; space where there are specific locations i.e. scale degrees that have<br/>&gt; &gt; different attractive tendencies.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Right.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; Now if the music has chords connected through proper voice leading the<br/>&gt; &gt; tones making up the chords produce petite melodies.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; You mean via the counterpoint?</p><p>Not necessarily full blown counterpoint but good voice leading so<br/>that you can hear voices moving in pitch space, not just successive<br/>members of chords frozen in time. There is also a concept of interval<br/>that changes i.e. interval between voices that is also relevant here.<br/>You couldn&apos;t hear dissonances resolving to consonances without it.</p><p>&gt; &gt; The attractive tendencies of scale degrees will surely then influence the way the<br/>&gt; &gt; harmony is heard. But I&apos;m not simply reducing harmony to melodic<br/>&gt; &gt; lines: a change of harmony also changes the attractive tendencies of<br/>&gt; &gt; different scale degrees.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; What do you mean exactly by &quot;attractive tendencies?&quot;</p><p>I don&apos;t have an exact definition but how for example the chord tones<br/>sound more like points of repose and the root note more than others.<br/>Or the tendency of voices moving stepwise and through leading tones,<br/>that sort of thing. Play c-d-e-f-g-a-b and stop there, kind of<br/>annoying?</p><p>&gt; &gt; &gt; F-C sounds like a resolution to me, it&apos;s a plagal resolution.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; OK. But plagal is supposed to be weaker than authentic. So let me<br/>&gt; &gt; ask: can you think of a psychoacoustic reason why a fifth descending<br/>&gt; &gt; to the tonic should sound like a stronger resolution than a fifth<br/>&gt; &gt; ascending to the tonic?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; We&apos;re discussing something that blends psychoacoustics and learning<br/>&gt; together, so I don&apos;t know where one ends and the other begins. I think<br/>&gt; it might have to do with comma pumps - I note that Gmaj -&gt; Cmaj only<br/>&gt; sounds strong if the Cmaj is established as the tonic. If you&apos;re in G<br/>&gt; mixolydian, Fmaj -&gt; Cmaj -&gt; Gmaj sounds like it&apos;s resolving to Gmaj,<br/>&gt; and you can flip your brain around to hear it either way. However, I<br/>&gt; note that a surefire way to get yourself to hear it as C major is Dm7<br/>&gt; -&gt; Gmaj -&gt; Cmaj, which is interesting because now you&apos;ve blended the<br/>&gt; subdominant and the dominant together with this tempered D, so you can<br/>&gt; run around in a tempered circle. G7 -&gt; C does the same thing, but<br/>&gt; smushed into one chord.</p><p>I may be too tired but I don&apos;t see how this answers my question. I<br/>meant just the bass line in the above question.</p><p>Quoting our conversation:</p><p>&gt; &gt; &gt; That&apos;s very possible, although I note that I hear it as resolving even<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; if it&apos;s played on an acoustic guitar with power chords. But it seems<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; to depend on what I hear as the &quot;key&quot; - e.g. Gmaj -&gt; Cmaj sounds like<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; it&apos;s resolving if the key is C, but not if the key is G. Then it just<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; sounds like I - IV.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; What about a single bass voice?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Sure, the same applies for a single bass voice.</p><p>&gt; Furthermore, just to throw out some shameless wild speculation that I<br/>&gt; can&apos;t support at all, G7 is almost certainly related to some kind of<br/>&gt; perception of 4:5:6:7, so perhaps that&apos;s another level of comma<br/>&gt; pumping on top of it. This would mean that C is an otonal interval on<br/>&gt; top of F which is an otonal interval on top of G which is an otonal<br/>&gt; interval on top of C. But that&apos;s more speculative.</p><p>What&apos;s an otonal interval? I thought that only chords can be otonal.<br/>But perhaps dominant seventh is a roughly tuned ~4:5:6:7. It can be<br/>extended too. Maybe this is why Emaj-Cmaj doesn&apos;t sound cadential<br/>i.e. there must be a higher level of tension in the penultimate<br/>chord. Note that this applies to early music dyadic cadences as well.</p><p>Kalle</p></div><h3>Mike Battaglia &#x3C;battaglia01@...&#x3E;</h3><span>5/21/2011 12:05:14 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>On Sat, May 21, 2011 at 10:48 AM, Kalle Aho &lt;kalleaho@...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Sorry for the delay in answering, my excuse is that my wife delivered<br/>&gt; a baby boy wednesday morning. :)</p><p>Hey, congratulations!

If<br/>there so happens to be a scale that includes a lot of these, great. If<br/>not, we&apos;ll use parallel scales to get the features we want, as we did<br/>with the minor scale.</p><p>But like I said in my followup message to you, I might have to concede<br/>part of my point, as mavila is blowing my mind. Try the comma pump<br/>Cmaj -&gt; Em -&gt; Bm -&gt; Fmaj -&gt; Cmaj, where B-F is still 4/3. Or try it<br/>backwards - Cmaj -&gt; Em -&gt; Bm -&gt; Fmaj -&gt; Cmaj. You see how that Bm -<br/>Fmaj is the equivalent of meantone iv-I? However, it doesn&apos;t sound<br/>like dark romantic harmony, but oddly &quot;diatonic&quot; in some sense.

I just put<br/>my headphones on instead of my crappy computer speakers and this is a<br/>whole new pump. But yes, now they sound like you described, and I<br/>don&apos;t think you need the Pajara scale to do it. In fact, you could<br/>hear this whole thing as just chromatic heptatonic harmony. In fact,<br/>if you want, I&apos;ll come up with a musical example that uses a different<br/>scale over every note and still sounds tonicified, if you want.</p><p>In fact, now that I&apos;ve heard it with the bass, I can &quot;remember&quot; what<br/>it sounds like after the bass, so now it sounds tonal. Therein lies a<br/>clue :)</p><p>&gt; The progression simply visits all the 7-limit tetrads of the scale<br/>&gt; (and some intermediate chords too) and the penultimate chord contains<br/>&gt; the characteristic dissonance that resolves in contrary motion<br/>&gt; (that&apos;s the Erlich-y part of the progression).

If you changed the melody on<br/>the last chord from F#-G# to G-G#, e.g. sharp the top note on the<br/>penultimate chord, I predict it&apos;ll make the whole thing stronger.</p><p>&gt; I&apos;m pretty sure other modes of pentachordal (and probably<br/>&gt; symmetrical) decatonic can be tonicized in some way too but are the<br/>&gt; pentachordal major and minor really the most tonal as Paul&apos;s theories<br/>&gt; suggest? I don&apos;t know.</p><p>I just can&apos;t get into scales anymore. Haha, I&apos;m sorry. I think it&apos;s<br/>just too limiting of a paradigm. If they had stuck to the diatonic<br/>scale when working out minor harmony, music today would absolutely<br/>suck. I wish we could all focus on our efforts on finding whatever<br/>these tonal &quot;features&quot; are directly without trying to find them in<br/>scales. If we get lucky and there&apos;s one scale that has them, great. If<br/>not, then we can always use parallel scales like they did with minor.<br/>Why not?</p><p>Dorian mode can be tonicized by just throwing the V chord in there<br/>sometimes, and using melodic minor instead of harmonic minor. Is it<br/>cheating? If so, I am a dirty cheater! But did you hear the Sibelius<br/>example I posted? He does the same thing, and I think the result is<br/>beautiful. To my ears, that&apos;s what music would have sounded like if<br/>we&apos;d gone with Dorian instead of Aeolian harmony - instead of having<br/>natural, harmonic, melodic minor, we&apos;d just have dorian and melodic<br/>minor. Instead of using bVI we&apos;d be using IV more. I really like the<br/>sound.</p><p>&gt; &gt; &gt; Now if the music has chords connected through proper voice leading the<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; tones making up the chords produce petite melodies.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; You mean via the counterpoint?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Not necessarily full blown counterpoint but good voice leading so<br/>&gt; that you can hear voices moving in pitch space, not just successive<br/>&gt; members of chords frozen in time.

Play c-d-e-f-g-a-b and stop there, kind of<br/>&gt; annoying?</p><p>Are these attractive tendencies caused by scale structure or just<br/>learning in general?</p><p>&gt; I may be too tired but I don&apos;t see how this answers my question. I<br/>&gt; meant just the bass line in the above question.</p><p>OK, I think that it has to do with learning, but I am not sure exactly<br/>what we&apos;ve learned.</p><p>&gt; &gt; Furthermore, just to throw out some shameless wild speculation that I<br/>&gt; &gt; can&apos;t support at all, G7 is almost certainly related to some kind of<br/>&gt; &gt; perception of 4:5:6:7, so perhaps that&apos;s another level of comma<br/>&gt; &gt; pumping on top of it.

Or<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; how about Melodic minor #4 - C D Eb F# G A B C - am I to believe that<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; the F#-Eb resolution will now be stronger than the F#-G or the B-C?<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; The augmented second is a rare interval but it&apos;s not a characteristic<br/>&gt; &gt; dissonance in Paul&apos;s sense because seconds are not consonances. The<br/>&gt; &gt; characteristic dissonance idea is not quite the same as the rare<br/>&gt; &gt; interval hypothesis as far as I know.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; What do you mean? If seconds aren&apos;t consonances, then they&apos;re<br/>&gt; dissonances, right? And if there&apos;s only one of them, wouldn&apos;t that be<br/>&gt; a &quot;characteristic&quot; dissonance? What if we tuned it in 17-equal, where<br/>&gt; the augmented seconds were ~11/9?</p><p>A characteristic dissonance is a dissonance that is produced from the<br/>same number of steps that otherwise produces consonances. Diminished<br/>fifth is one because the number of steps it spans otherwise produces<br/>perfect fifths. So Ab-B is not a characteristic dissonance because<br/>seconds are dissonances.</p><p>&gt; &gt; The progression simply visits all the 7-limit tetrads of the scale<br/>&gt; &gt; (and some intermediate chords too) and the penultimate chord contains<br/>&gt; &gt; the characteristic dissonance that resolves in contrary motion<br/>&gt; &gt; (that&apos;s the Erlich-y part of the progression). (It also contains ~9:7<br/>&gt; &gt; which is also a characteristic dissonance in Paul&apos;s theory, that<br/>&gt; &gt; resolves in oblique motion.) Perhaps that chord should have been held<br/>&gt; &gt; longer to really hear the characteristic dissonance(s).<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; With the bass it sounds a lot different.

The fact that 17-equal seems<br/>to be universally recognized as having excellent melodic properties,<br/>and 19-equal as well if you sharp the leading tone by 1\19, suggests<br/>that there is some kind of psychoacoustic component to what makes<br/>leading tones work.

Why say it&apos;s in dorian?<br/>&gt; My answer is that the alteration of degrees happens only in special<br/>&gt; situations like cadences.</p><p>Because the feeling of the key that a song is in isn&apos;t only determined<br/>by its root note and the quality of the tonic triad. You, or at least<br/>I, are/am also always aware of the other chords that are &quot;nearby&quot; the<br/>tonic. For instance, Stevie Wonder&apos;s &quot;Uptight&quot; has a minor v chord and<br/>features bVII often. Not only does this create an entirely different<br/>feeling than if the song had a major V chord, but to play the bVII<br/>scale degree over the root will sound a million times more appropriate<br/>than playing a standard major vii (if you have to choose one, that<br/>is). Likewise, the Sibelius composition uses IV so often that it<br/>becomes part of the background vibe of the song, and in that way it<br/>creates a different feeling than if they were mashing on bVI instead.<br/>And to be honest I think it sounds amazing, and I wish the classical<br/>repertoire made more use of that effect.</p><p>The idea we&apos;re discussing is that a note doesn&apos;t actually need to be a<br/>part of the bare tonic triad in order to influence the sense of &quot;mode&quot;<br/>or &quot;key&quot; that a composition is in. For further theoretical<br/>justification of this idea, A song can be in a &quot;major&quot; or a &quot;minor&quot;<br/>key even if the guitar is just playing power chords; the other notes<br/>and chords that are played will &quot;clue you in&quot; to whether the song is<br/>in major or minor. Despite that you aren&apos;t actually playing ever<br/>playing the tonic triad, your brain puts the pieces together and<br/>figures out what the triad -would be- if you did play it.</p><p>Who&apos;s to say that this process is limited to root, third, and fifth?<br/>My brain seems to put -all- the notes played recently together to form<br/>the holistic gestalt of an entire mode, not just a 1-3-5 triad. If<br/>you&apos;re in minor and you&apos;ve played a major 6th recently, I&apos;ll remember<br/>that, and know that that&apos;s a part of the scale. If you&apos;ve played a<br/>major 6th and a minor 7th, I&apos;ll know this is partly Dorian (unless<br/>you&apos;ve played a #4, in which case it&apos;s Dorian #4, a mode of harmonic<br/>minor).</p><p>What is important is that to habitually play a major 6th over a minor<br/>chord actually makes the music -feel- different. These alterations<br/>aren&apos;t just random emotionless contrivances of melody; they actually<br/>influence the feeling of the music by changing the character of the<br/>harmonic ambience that is presented. To say that &quot;this piece is in<br/>Dorian&quot; communicates information about that ambience and its<br/>associated feeling. This is not a trivial statement.</p><p>You can say that this piece is in D Aeolian and just happens to<br/>&quot;cadentially alter&quot; it to Dorian every time he hits that B natural.<br/>You can likewise say the same thing about Come Together, that it&apos;s<br/>really D aeolian with some &quot;cadential modulations&quot; into dorian. I<br/>would be very surprised if the average person actually heard it that<br/>way, with a Bb there &quot;naturally,&quot; and the note B being a departure or<br/>modulation from that.</p><p>-Mike</p></div><h3>bobvalentine1 &#x3C;bob.valentine@...&#x3E;</h3><span>6/5/2011 1:05:05 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, Mike Battaglia &lt;battaglia01@...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt; Because they&apos;d have to be on crack to ignore something as obvious as<br/>&gt; V-i.

And I&apos;m still not convinced that<br/>universal reasons like human psychoacoustics would have selected V-i<br/>as the strongest possible minor key progression in all possible<br/>histories of Western music. I believe that in actual history it&apos;s<br/>just that the conventions of musica ficta period carried to the<br/>following major-minor system. In musica ficta (literally &quot;false&quot; or<br/>&quot;contrived&quot; music, haha!) leading tones were sharpened at cadences<br/>and the composers took this practice to the new style.</p><p>&gt; &gt; &gt; I wish we could all focus on our efforts on finding whatever<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; these tonal &quot;features&quot; are directly without trying to find them in<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; scales.

Despite that you aren&apos;t actually playing ever<br/>&gt; playing the tonic triad, your brain puts the pieces together and<br/>&gt; figures out what the triad -would be- if you did play it.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Who&apos;s to say that this process is limited to root, third, and fifth?<br/>&gt; My brain seems to put -all- the notes played recently together to form<br/>&gt; the holistic gestalt of an entire mode, not just a 1-3-5 triad. If<br/>&gt; you&apos;re in minor and you&apos;ve played a major 6th recently, I&apos;ll remember<br/>&gt; that, and know that that&apos;s a part of the scale. If you&apos;ve played a<br/>&gt; major 6th and a minor 7th, I&apos;ll know this is partly Dorian (unless<br/>&gt; you&apos;ve played a #4, in which case it&apos;s Dorian #4, a mode of harmonic<br/>&gt; minor).<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; What is important is that to habitually play a major 6th over a minor<br/>&gt; chord actually makes the music -feel- different. These alterations<br/>&gt; aren&apos;t just random emotionless contrivances of melody; they actually<br/>&gt; influence the feeling of the music by changing the character of the<br/>&gt; harmonic ambience that is presented. To say that &quot;this piece is in<br/>&gt; Dorian&quot; communicates information about that ambience and its<br/>&gt; associated feeling. This is not a trivial statement.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; You can say that this piece is in D Aeolian and just happens to<br/>&gt; &quot;cadentially alter&quot; it to Dorian every time he hits that B natural.<br/>&gt; You can likewise say the same thing about Come Together, that it&apos;s<br/>&gt; really D aeolian with some &quot;cadential modulations&quot; into dorian. I<br/>&gt; would be very surprised if the average person actually heard it that<br/>&gt; way, with a Bb there &quot;naturally,&quot; and the note B being a departure or<br/>&gt; modulation from that.</p><p>No no no, I wasn&apos;t claiming it&apos;s not in dorian. I agree about that but<br/>what I claim is that it is in dorian because the alterations happen<br/>only in special occasions.</p><p>Kalle</p></div><h3>cityoftheasleep &#x3C;igliashon@...&#x3E;</h3><span>6/5/2011 4:03:48 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;Kalle Aho&quot; &lt;kalleaho@...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt; Listen to this file:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; <a href="http://launch.groups.yahoo.com/group/tuning/files/KalleAho/Cadence.mp3">http://launch.groups.yahoo.com/group/tuning/files/KalleAho/Cadence.mp3</a><br/>&gt;</p><p>For what it&apos;s worth, I heard the first example as strongest, followed by the second (which sounded &quot;more traditional&quot; but somehow weaker), followed by the 3rd, which did not sound resolved at all.</p><p>-Igs</p></div><h3>Kalle Aho &#x3C;kalleaho@...&#x3E;</h3><span>6/6/2011 11:00:44 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;cityoftheasleep&quot; &lt;igliashon@...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; --- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;Kalle Aho&quot; &lt;kalleaho@&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt; &gt; Listen to this file:<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; <a href="http://launch.groups.yahoo.com/group/tuning/files/KalleAho/Cadence.mp3">http://launch.groups.yahoo.com/group/tuning/files/KalleAho/Cadence.mp3</a><br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; For what it&apos;s worth, I heard the first example as strongest, followed by the second (which sounded &quot;more traditional&quot; but somehow weaker), followed by the 3rd, which did not sound resolved at all.</p><p>This is exactly how I hear them too.</p><p>Kalle</p></div><h3>genewardsmith &#x3C;genewardsmith@...&#x3E;</h3><span>6/6/2011 11:49:04 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;Kalle Aho&quot; &lt;kalleaho@...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; --- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;cityoftheasleep&quot; &lt;igliashon@&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; --- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;Kalle Aho&quot; &lt;kalleaho@&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; Listen to this file:<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; <a href="http://launch.groups.yahoo.com/group/tuning/files/KalleAho/Cadence.mp3">http://launch.groups.yahoo.com/group/tuning/files/KalleAho/Cadence.mp3</a><br/>&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; For what it&apos;s worth, I heard the first example as strongest, followed by the second (which sounded &quot;more traditional&quot; but somehow weaker), followed by the 3rd, which did not sound resolved at all.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; This is exactly how I hear them too.</p><p>I thought the second was the most cadential.

But what if you flatten the second-top in the penultimate chord<br/>by &quot;s,&quot; so that it sounds like a b9 resolving to a m6 chord in<br/>meantone terms?</p><p>&gt; As a bonus I&apos;ve included a third progression where the tones move by<br/>&gt; L-s. That&apos;s around 66 cents which is near the supposedly optimal 1\17<br/>&gt; leading tone.

In a certain way I like it more than the other ones. I don&apos;t<br/>know if the strength of the resolution would have increased if you<br/>made them move by s instead of 66 cents, but I do like the flattening<br/>of the seventh on the penultimate chord (I guess you&apos;re altering 7/4<br/>to 12/7?).</p><p>After listening to the example on repeat a bunch of times I actually<br/>like the last one more than the others; the supermajor 6th gives it a<br/>whole new color and it resolves beautifully to the minor 6 chord at<br/>the end. The 66 cents leading tone might actually be too narrow,<br/>although I&apos;m not sure why.</p><p>&gt; &gt; Because they&apos;d have to be on crack to ignore something as obvious as<br/>&gt; &gt; V-i. Arbitrary limitations and preconceptions have never served<br/>&gt; &gt; anyone.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Or perhaps it would have sounded melodically more like traditional<br/>&gt; folk music (e.g. of Ireland).</p><p>OK, good point. I should have caught this one, being as I just wrote a<br/>song in pretty straight Aeolian that tries to nail the Irish folk song<br/>feel, but didn&apos;t think anything of it when I posted this. So you&apos;re<br/>right.</p><p>&gt; And I&apos;m still not convinced that<br/>&gt; universal reasons like human psychoacoustics would have selected V-i<br/>&gt; as the strongest possible minor key progression in all possible<br/>&gt; histories of Western music.</p><p>The strength of a resolution seems to have something to do with<br/>learning. For instance, you apparently have to &quot;learn&quot; to hear<br/>decatonic progressions as sounding decatonic; otherwise they just<br/>sound diatonic. I have no idea what the difference is, because they<br/>all sound the same to me. I also hated the third progression in the<br/>sample you posted above, but liked it a lot after hearing it a few<br/>times. However, there has to be some reason why 1\17 seems to function<br/>as The Greatest Leading Tone Ever, and psychoacoustics is a natural<br/>fit for why that might be. But perhaps it has to do with cognition as<br/>well - if we were all used to 17, then maybe we&apos;d think that 22 was<br/>The Greatest Leading Tone Ever or something.</p><p>&gt; I believe that in actual history it&apos;s<br/>&gt; just that the conventions of musica ficta period carried to the<br/>&gt; following major-minor system. In musica ficta (literally &quot;false&quot; or<br/>&gt; &quot;contrived&quot; music, haha!) leading tones were sharpened at cadences<br/>&gt; and the composers took this practice to the new style.</p><p>But don&apos;t you agree that the two have different musical effects? There<br/>is a certain sense in which V-i is different from v-i. What aspects of<br/>the contrast between the two do you think are psychoacoustic and what<br/>aspects do you think are learned?</p><p>&gt; &gt; Kalle, all I&apos;m saying is that when they started to mess around with<br/>&gt; &gt; modern, cliche, &quot;tonal&quot; harmony, they opted to DITCH the aeolian scale<br/>&gt; &gt; and start using things like V-i. They left the scale because V-i<br/>&gt; &gt; improved the &quot;tonalness&quot; of the harmony. Hence, this is a &quot;tonal<br/>&gt; &gt; feature&quot; that they &quot;directly&quot; found and that lies outside of the<br/>&gt; &gt; scalar structure of aeolian mode.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; That&apos;s funny because aeolian was probably never used strictly in the<br/>&gt; period between gregorian chant and tonal harmony. In fact the 19th<br/>&gt; century revival of modes used them much more strictly than music in<br/>&gt; renaissance because the 19th century composers wanted a stronger<br/>&gt; distinction from major and minor.</p><p>I should have said the diatonic scale. They ditched the diatonic<br/>scale. Rather than continuing to search for scale patterns in the<br/>diatonic scale, they opted to change it. And when we get into 20th<br/>century extended harmony, they even got the diminished scale involved,<br/>and used the altered scale over dominant chords.</p><p>&gt; &gt; For melody, rather than using aeolian and forcing the harmony into<br/>&gt; &gt; that, they opted instead to use a rotating cast of heptatonic scales<br/>&gt; &gt; for harmony, and let the melody be as it will. If you have some kind<br/>&gt; &gt; of reservation to this objection, I&apos;d love to hear why, and why the<br/>&gt; &gt; answer couldn&apos;t just be that perhaps there&apos;s more to tonality than<br/>&gt; &gt; Paul laid in the Pajara paper.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Where exactly in that paper did Paul command us to stick to aeolian<br/>&gt; scale? He discusses &quot;altered&quot; scales in the paper after all.</p><p>Paul discusses tonality as stemming from the rare step sizes in a<br/>scale. I ask you how you reconcile this paradigm with the fact that<br/>tonality in minor doesn&apos;t seem to have anything to do with a single<br/>scale. Do you think that it comes from the scalar structures of the<br/>three parallel minor scales? Or do you think that there are no<br/>parallel minor scales, and if so, where does tonality emerge from?</p><p>&gt; &gt; I am more than willing to admit that scale structure may play a role<br/>&gt; &gt; in this, and my recent experiments with Father suggests that it may.<br/>&gt; &gt; But it may simply have more to do with &quot;leading tones&quot; than some sort<br/>&gt; &gt; of holographic tonalness scale property. The fact that 17-equal seems<br/>&gt; &gt; to be universally recognized as having excellent melodic properties,<br/>&gt; &gt; and 19-equal as well if you sharp the leading tone by 1\19, suggests<br/>&gt; &gt; that there is some kind of psychoacoustic component to what makes<br/>&gt; &gt; leading tones work. Leading tones can exist outside of a scale.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Of course they can! Does the third cadence example sound melodically<br/>&gt; good to you? To me it doesn&apos;t.</p><p>Given a brief training period, it&apos;ll sound melodically good to you<br/>too! Just wait for it... :)</p><p>I think the strength of the melody could be improved by making the<br/>leading tones a little bigger though.</p><p>&gt; &gt; &gt; Melodic movement by chromatic semitone sounds instantly like<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; going outside the basic seven degrees while typical use of the minor<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; doesn&apos;t.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; What do you mean &quot;typical use of the minor?&quot;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; The usual sort like using different scales when ascending and<br/>&gt; descending.</p><p>I&apos;m not sure I follow - what are the basic seven degrees, the bare<br/>diatonic scale? Because I hear melodic minor as being different from<br/>the diatonic scale, obviously. So I&apos;m a bit confused.</p><p>&gt; &gt; You can say that this piece is in D Aeolian and just happens to<br/>&gt; &gt; &quot;cadentially alter&quot; it to Dorian every time he hits that B natural.<br/>&gt; &gt; You can likewise say the same thing about Come Together, that it&apos;s<br/>&gt; &gt; really D aeolian with some &quot;cadential modulations&quot; into dorian.

I agree about that but<br/>&gt; what I claim is that it is in dorian because the alterations happen<br/>&gt; only in special occasions.</p><p>But there are no alterations. The alteration happens when the B<br/>finally changes to Bb, at which point it moves away from Dorian and<br/>into Aeolian. They don&apos;t play a single Bb until almost the last phrase<br/>of the song. The melody is in Dorian throughout, and the only<br/>alteration until that Bb is that they move the C up to C# so as to put<br/>you at the major V chord.</p><p>-Mike</p></div><h3>Kalle Aho &#x3C;kalleaho@...&#x3E;</h3><span>6/12/2011 2:14:39 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Back to this...</p><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, Mike Battaglia &lt;battaglia01@...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; On Sun, Jun 5, 2011 at 5:17 PM, Kalle Aho &lt;kalleaho@...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; Why not just say &quot;s&quot; instead of &quot;2\22&quot;?

Note that this sort of talk where the dominant function is<br/>not tied to a position of a fifth above the tonic has a precedent at<br/>least here:</p><p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flamenco#Harmony">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flamenco#Harmony</a></p><p>Also, people talk about substitute dominants and those are not in<br/>a fifth relationship to the tonic.</p><p>&gt; &gt; &gt; Kalle, all I&apos;m saying is that when they started to mess around with<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; modern, cliche, &quot;tonal&quot; harmony, they opted to DITCH the aeolian scale<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; and start using things like V-i. They left the scale because V-i<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; improved the &quot;tonalness&quot; of the harmony. Hence, this is a &quot;tonal<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; feature&quot; that they &quot;directly&quot; found and that lies outside of the<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; scalar structure of aeolian mode.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; That&apos;s funny because aeolian was probably never used strictly in the<br/>&gt; &gt; period between gregorian chant and tonal harmony. In fact the 19th<br/>&gt; &gt; century revival of modes used them much more strictly than music in<br/>&gt; &gt; renaissance because the 19th century composers wanted a stronger<br/>&gt; &gt; distinction from major and minor.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I should have said the diatonic scale. They ditched the diatonic<br/>&gt; scale. Rather than continuing to search for scale patterns in the<br/>&gt; diatonic scale, they opted to change it. And when we get into 20th<br/>&gt; century extended harmony, they even got the diminished scale involved,<br/>&gt; and used the altered scale over dominant chords.</p><p>But they already had ditched the strict use of the diatonic scale<br/>before tonal harmony. Musica ficta.</p><p>&gt; &gt; &gt; For melody, rather than using aeolian and forcing the harmony into<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; that, they opted instead to use a rotating cast of heptatonic scales<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; for harmony, and let the melody be as it will. If you have some kind<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; of reservation to this objection, I&apos;d love to hear why, and why the<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; answer couldn&apos;t just be that perhaps there&apos;s more to tonality than<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; Paul laid in the Pajara paper.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; Where exactly in that paper did Paul command us to stick to aeolian<br/>&gt; &gt; scale? He discusses &quot;altered&quot; scales in the paper after all.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Paul discusses tonality as stemming from the rare step sizes in a<br/>&gt; scale.</p><p>That&apos;s only a half-truth. Remember the characteristic dissonances!</p><p>&gt; I ask you how you reconcile this paradigm with the fact that<br/>&gt; tonality in minor doesn&apos;t seem to have anything to do with a single<br/>&gt; scale. Do you think that it comes from the scalar structures of the<br/>&gt; three parallel minor scales? Or do you think that there are no<br/>&gt; parallel minor scales, and if so, where does tonality emerge from?</p><p>Personally, I don&apos;t have any strong opinions about the emergence of<br/>tonality. Paul would probably say that if any new (compared to the<br/>unaltered scale) intervals are avoided in use then they don&apos;t count<br/>when observing his rules for tonality.</p><p>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Melodic movement by chromatic semitone sounds instantly like<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; going outside the basic seven degrees while typical use of the minor<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; doesn&apos;t.<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; What do you mean &quot;typical use of the minor?&quot;<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; The usual sort like using different scales when ascending and<br/>&gt; &gt; descending.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I&apos;m not sure I follow - what are the basic seven degrees, the bare<br/>&gt; diatonic scale? Because I hear melodic minor as being different from<br/>&gt; the diatonic scale, obviously. So I&apos;m a bit confused.</p><p>The seven degrees are more abstract entities in that they can be<br/>inflected. The minor melodies may use different inflections<br/>depending on the melodic direction. But if this inflecting is done<br/>directly by playing a tone and its&apos; chromatic inflection<br/>consecutively then the music sounds chromatic. Doesn&apos;t that make<br/>sense to you?</p><p>&gt; &gt; &gt; You can say that this piece is in D Aeolian and just happens to<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &quot;cadentially alter&quot; it to Dorian every time he hits that B natural.<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; You can likewise say the same thing about Come Together, that it&apos;s<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; really D aeolian with some &quot;cadential modulations&quot; into dorian. I<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; would be very surprised if the average person actually heard it that<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; way, with a Bb there &quot;naturally,&quot; and the note B being a departure or<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; modulation from that.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; No no no, I wasn&apos;t claiming it&apos;s not in dorian. I agree about that but<br/>&gt; &gt; what I claim is that it is in dorian because the alterations happen<br/>&gt; &gt; only in special occasions.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; But there are no alterations. The alteration happens when the B<br/>&gt; finally changes to Bb, at which point it moves away from Dorian and<br/>&gt; into Aeolian. They don&apos;t play a single Bb until almost the last phrase<br/>&gt; of the song. The melody is in Dorian throughout, and the only<br/>&gt; alteration until that Bb is that they move the C up to C# so as to put<br/>&gt; you at the major V chord.</p><p>And why isn&apos;t that a description of alteration at a special occasion?</p><p>Kalle</p></div><h3>Mike Battaglia &#x3C;battaglia01@...&#x3E;</h3><span>6/12/2011 4:00:30 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>On Sun, Jun 12, 2011 at 5:14 PM, Kalle Aho &lt;kalleaho@...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; Listen to this file:<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; <a href="http://launch.groups.yahoo.com/group/tuning/files/KalleAho/Cadence.mp3">http://launch.groups.yahoo.com/group/tuning/files/KalleAho/Cadence.mp3</a><br/>&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; The first one is the same one I used in the SoundCloud example.<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; You probably hear the second one as the strongest.

If you could<br/>send me a MIDI file I&apos;ll try it though.</p><p>&gt; &gt; The strength of a resolution seems to have something to do with<br/>&gt; &gt; learning. For instance, you apparently have to &quot;learn&quot; to hear<br/>&gt; &gt; decatonic progressions as sounding decatonic; otherwise they just<br/>&gt; &gt; sound diatonic. I have no idea what the difference is, because they<br/>&gt; &gt; all sound the same to me. I also hated the third progression in the<br/>&gt; &gt; sample you posted above, but liked it a lot after hearing it a few<br/>&gt; &gt; times. However, there has to be some reason why 1\17 seems to function<br/>&gt; &gt; as The Greatest Leading Tone Ever, and psychoacoustics is a natural<br/>&gt; &gt; fit for why that might be. But perhaps it has to do with cognition as<br/>&gt; &gt; well - if we were all used to 17, then maybe we&apos;d think that 22 was<br/>&gt; &gt; The Greatest Leading Tone Ever or something.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; How can decatonic progressions with their consecutive semitone-like<br/>&gt; steps sound diatonic to you? Chromatic maybe, but diatonic?!</p><p>They don&apos;t really sound fully chromatic, not like 12-tone serialist<br/>music or anything like that. They sound, you know, mostly &quot;diatonic&quot;<br/>with some extra notes thrown in there. To be honest it just sounds<br/>like, let&apos;s call it, &quot;extended diatonic harmony,&quot; like the kind they&apos;d<br/>use in jazz standards or early 20th century pop music and so on.</p><p>&gt; And where&apos;s the evidence that everyone thinks that 1\17 is the best<br/>&gt; leading tone, was there a survey that I missed?</p><p>It&apos;s not 1\17 specifically, it&apos;s just that around that area leading<br/>tones seem to resolve really well. For example, take 19-equal vs<br/>12-equal - to my ears, the ti-&gt;do resolution, if left unaltered, is<br/>much weaker than that of 12-tet. However, if you sharpen the leading<br/>tone by 1\19, it&apos;s much stronger, and suddenly 19-equal seems to have<br/>excellent melodic properties. I&apos;m not the first person to notice this,<br/>and I&apos;ve seen references to this scattered all over the place, both on<br/>and off this list, but if you disagree I won&apos;t argue the point as I&apos;m<br/>not an expert on it.</p><p>The point with 17-equal is that it puts the small step in the diatonic<br/>scale equal around this spot, so no alteration is required. Hence<br/>17-equal is often said to have good melodic properties (I think George<br/>Secor originally brought this point up), and that&apos;s how it sounds to<br/>me as well, and I&apos;ve never heard anyone disagree with it. Does that<br/>not seem to be true for you?</p><p>&gt; &gt; But don&apos;t you agree that the two have different musical effects? There<br/>&gt; &gt; is a certain sense in which V-i is different from v-i.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Of course.</p><p>Do you think they would have been aware of these different effects in<br/>the musica ficta period, and that that&apos;s why they sharpened the<br/>leading tones?</p><p>&gt; I&apos;d say (again) that it&apos;s the raising of the seventh degree that<br/>&gt; allows the fifth chord (and especially its&apos; seventh chord version) to<br/>&gt; take the function of dominant. v doesn&apos;t quite sound like a dominant,<br/>&gt; really!</p><p>I do now agree with you that something about the concept of &quot;leading<br/>tone&quot; is what&apos;s important, but I&apos;m having trouble seeing the big<br/>picture. In the diatonic scale, the leading tones also happen to be<br/>the &quot;rare intervals.&quot; In Pajara, however, the leading tone-sized<br/>intervals are -not- the rare intervals, but rather they&apos;re everywhere.<br/>You can&apos;t get away from them, which is partially why the whole thing<br/>sounds so incoherent to me sometimes.</p><p>Maybe the secret is just to keep leading tones as rare intervals in<br/>the scale - this way, they aren&apos;t played so much that you get<br/>desensitized to them, and also the rare intervals are also leading<br/>tones inasmuch as they carry minimal spectral overlap. In fact, this<br/>seems to be what I naturally like about the scales that I said were<br/>awesome - Keemun[7] and Father[8]. Keemun is 4L3s, and Father is 5L3s,<br/>and both of them consist of nice smooth whole tones with some jarring<br/>leading tones to fracture the scale up thrown in there. And I notice<br/>that although the large steps are rare in Mavila[7], they&apos;re<br/>definitely not ideal leading tones (although Mavila is nice for other<br/>reasons).</p><p>I&apos;ve also liked this about hedgehog as well, which is 6L2s - try the<br/>LLsLLLsL mode in 22-equal. Note the LLsL pentachord sounds like a very<br/>flat version of the same LLsL pentachord that exists in the diatonic<br/>scale, except now the 5/4 is replaced with 6/5, the 9/8=10/9 replaced<br/>with 10/9=11/10, the 4/3 replaced with 9/7, and the 3/2 replaced with<br/>10/7, 4:5:6 in general replaced with 5:6:7, and 8:9:10:12 replaced<br/>with 10:11:12:14. (Holy crap)</p><p>Actually, I didn&apos;t realize this until I started typing the above just<br/>how crazy that is. WTF crazy property of LLsL is this that lets it<br/>works out this neatly? If you do the same thing with 7:9:11 as the<br/>base chord, does it work out that neatly? The LLsLLL machine[6] scale<br/>of 11-equal gives us that, and that&apos;s another one of Igs&apos; magic<br/>&quot;screwed up diatonic scales&quot; - the 10/9=9/8 becomes 9/8=8/7, the 5/4<br/>becomes 9/7, the 4/3 becomes 11/8, the 3/2 becomes 11/7, the 4:5:6<br/>becomes 7:9:11, and the 8:9:10:12 becomes 7:8:9:11. WTF?</p><p>&gt; In an unaltered aeolian scale that function is more likely<br/>&gt; taken by the nominally subdominant minor sixth chord, or so I<br/>&gt; maintain.

They ditched the diatonic<br/>&gt; &gt; scale. Rather than continuing to search for scale patterns in the<br/>&gt; &gt; diatonic scale, they opted to change it.

Remember the characteristic dissonances!</p><p>Hmm... perhaps I need to go through and read it again. But to be<br/>honest, in the porcupine examples I laid out in 22-equal, setting the<br/>dominant chord equal to 4:5:6:7 made it resolve more strongly than<br/>setting it to 1/1 5/4 3/2 9/5, whatever that might be. The latter is<br/>more dissonant, but the 9/5 on top resolving to the 5/4 of the I chord<br/>was much weaker than the 7/4 resolving, despite that the first one had<br/>the diminished fifth as 16/11 on top (which Paul chose as being more<br/>dissonant than 7/5), and the second had it as 7/5. But the first one<br/>gives you a better leading tone, which is more dissonant than any of<br/>these intervals.</p><p>&gt; &gt; I ask you how you reconcile this paradigm with the fact that<br/>&gt; &gt; tonality in minor doesn&apos;t seem to have anything to do with a single<br/>&gt; &gt; scale.

However, if you sharpen the leading<br/>&gt; tone by 1\19, it&apos;s much stronger, and suddenly 19-equal seems to have<br/>&gt; excellent melodic properties. I&apos;m not the first person to notice this,<br/>&gt; and I&apos;ve seen references to this scattered all over the place, both on<br/>&gt; and off this list, but if you disagree I won&apos;t argue the point as I&apos;m<br/>&gt; not an expert on it.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; The point with 17-equal is that it puts the small step in the diatonic<br/>&gt; scale equal around this spot, so no alteration is required. Hence<br/>&gt; 17-equal is often said to have good melodic properties (I think George<br/>&gt; Secor originally brought this point up), and that&apos;s how it sounds to<br/>&gt; me as well, and I&apos;ve never heard anyone disagree with it. Does that<br/>&gt; not seem to be true for you?</p><p>I&apos;m just skeptical about it. Is it really an interval of minimal<br/>spectral overlap or something like that? Doesn&apos;t that honour actually<br/>go to Phi? And if it&apos;s some local metastable interval then there are<br/>others as well and it is not singled out as something universal. The<br/>size of the steps in the third progression is right there between<br/>1\17 and 1\19 so why doesn&apos;t it sound that great?</p><p>&gt; &gt; &gt; But don&apos;t you agree that the two have different musical effects? There<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; is a certain sense in which V-i is different from v-i.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; Of course.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Do you think they would have been aware of these different effects in<br/>&gt; the musica ficta period, and that that&apos;s why they sharpened the<br/>&gt; leading tones?</p><p>No, the period spans centuries and multiple styles starting at 12th<br/>century when there was no triadic harmony. At first the ficta were<br/>used to avoid offending intervals like tritones but soon they were<br/>also used in cadences which were dyadic progressions from imperfect<br/>to perfect consonances. As to why they did that, I don&apos;t know.</p><p>&gt; &gt; I&apos;d say (again) that it&apos;s the raising of the seventh degree that<br/>&gt; &gt; allows the fifth chord (and especially its&apos; seventh chord version) to<br/>&gt; &gt; take the function of dominant. v doesn&apos;t quite sound like a dominant,<br/>&gt; &gt; really!<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I do now agree with you that something about the concept of &quot;leading<br/>&gt; tone&quot; is what&apos;s important, but I&apos;m having trouble seeing the big<br/>&gt; picture.</p><p>But I don&apos;t think leading tones are universally important to all<br/>tuning systems and in my opinion that something that is important<br/>about leading tone in the minor tonality is that the raised seventh<br/>degree produces another tritone in the scale so that we have a V7<br/>chord that leads in contrary motion to i chord, contrary motion being<br/>the strongest of motions. One of the scale degrees the tritone<br/>expands to is the tonic, that doesn&apos;t happen in the natural minor<br/>cadence.</p><p>Another reason for harmonic minor was probably the need for<br/>functional symmetry between major and minor tonalities so that<br/>melodies could be modulated between major and minor with the same<br/>order of harmonic functions, one of the great dramatic techniques of<br/>common practice music.</p><p>&gt; In the diatonic scale, the leading tones also happen to be<br/>&gt; the &quot;rare intervals.&quot; In Pajara, however, the leading tone-sized<br/>&gt; intervals are -not- the rare intervals, but rather they&apos;re everywhere.<br/>&gt; You can&apos;t get away from them, which is partially why the whole thing<br/>&gt; sounds so incoherent to me sometimes.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Maybe the secret is just to keep leading tones as rare intervals in<br/>&gt; the scale - this way, they aren&apos;t played so much that you get<br/>&gt; desensitized to them, and also the rare intervals are also leading<br/>&gt; tones inasmuch as they carry minimal spectral overlap. In fact, this<br/>&gt; seems to be what I naturally like about the scales that I said were<br/>&gt; awesome - Keemun[7] and Father[8]. Keemun is 4L3s, and Father is 5L3s,<br/>&gt; and both of them consist of nice smooth whole tones with some jarring<br/>&gt; leading tones to fracture the scale up thrown in there. And I notice<br/>&gt; that although the large steps are rare in Mavila[7], they&apos;re<br/>&gt; definitely not ideal leading tones (although Mavila is nice for other<br/>&gt; reasons).</p><p>Maybe Mavila should be tuned so that the large step is some local<br/>interval of minimal spectral overlap?</p><p>&gt; I&apos;ve also liked this about hedgehog as well, which is 6L2s - try the<br/>&gt; LLsLLLsL mode in 22-equal. Note the LLsL pentachord sounds like a very<br/>&gt; flat version of the same LLsL pentachord that exists in the diatonic<br/>&gt; scale, except now the 5/4 is replaced with 6/5, the 9/8=10/9 replaced<br/>&gt; with 10/9=11/10, the 4/3 replaced with 9/7, and the 3/2 replaced with<br/>&gt; 10/7, 4:5:6 in general replaced with 5:6:7, and 8:9:10:12 replaced<br/>&gt; with 10:11:12:14. (Holy crap)<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Actually, I didn&apos;t realize this until I started typing the above just<br/>&gt; how crazy that is. WTF crazy property of LLsL is this that lets it<br/>&gt; works out this neatly? If you do the same thing with 7:9:11 as the<br/>&gt; base chord, does it work out that neatly? The LLsLLL machine[6] scale<br/>&gt; of 11-equal gives us that, and that&apos;s another one of Igs&apos; magic<br/>&gt; &quot;screwed up diatonic scales&quot; - the 10/9=9/8 becomes 9/8=8/7, the 5/4<br/>&gt; becomes 9/7, the 4/3 becomes 11/8, the 3/2 becomes 11/7, the 4:5:6<br/>&gt; becomes 7:9:11, and the 8:9:10:12 becomes 7:8:9:11. WTF?</p><p>I&apos;ll try these sometime.</p><p>&gt; &gt; In an unaltered aeolian scale that function is more likely<br/>&gt; &gt; taken by the nominally subdominant minor sixth chord, or so I<br/>&gt; &gt; maintain. Note that this sort of talk where the dominant function is<br/>&gt; &gt; not tied to a position of a fifth above the tonic has a precedent at<br/>&gt; &gt; least here:<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flamenco#Harmony">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flamenco#Harmony</a><br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; In what sense do you mean that the function is &quot;dominant?&quot;</p><p>Creating an instability that strongly suggests the tonic as the most<br/>satisfying resolution.</p><p>&gt; I hear Fmaj -&gt; Em in the Andalusian cadence as resolving very strongly,<br/>&gt; perhaps rivaling dominant in strength, but if dominant just means &quot;strong<br/>&gt; resolution&quot; then what does subdominant mean? &quot;Weak resolution?&quot;</p><p>You mean Fmaj -&gt; Emaj, right?</p><p>In this context subdominant has multiple meanings that can be<br/>dissociated: a chord that has the tonic as its&apos; dominant, predominant<br/>etc. But how we name the functions is not that important, my point is<br/>that harmonic functions should not be equated with scale degrees or<br/>root relations.</p><p>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Where exactly in that paper did Paul command us to stick to aeolian<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; scale? He discusses &quot;altered&quot; scales in the paper after all.<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; Paul discusses tonality as stemming from the rare step sizes in a<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; scale.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; That&apos;s only a half-truth. Remember the characteristic dissonances!<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Hmm... perhaps I need to go through and read it again. But to be<br/>&gt; honest, in the porcupine examples I laid out in 22-equal, setting the<br/>&gt; dominant chord equal to 4:5:6:7 made it resolve more strongly than<br/>&gt; setting it to 1/1 5/4 3/2 9/5, whatever that might be. The latter is<br/>&gt; more dissonant, but the 9/5 on top resolving to the 5/4 of the I chord<br/>&gt; was much weaker than the 7/4 resolving, despite that the first one had<br/>&gt; the diminished fifth as 16/11 on top (which Paul chose as being more<br/>&gt; dissonant than 7/5), and the second had it as 7/5. But the first one<br/>&gt; gives you a better leading tone, which is more dissonant than any of<br/>&gt; these intervals.</p><p>The ~5:7 in 22-equal is identical to the tritone we are used to in<br/>12-equal and the tritone is the characteristic dissonance of the<br/>diatonic scale.</p><p>&gt; &gt; &gt; I ask you how you reconcile this paradigm with the fact that<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; tonality in minor doesn&apos;t seem to have anything to do with a single<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; scale. Do you think that it comes from the scalar structures of the<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; three parallel minor scales? Or do you think that there are no<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; parallel minor scales, and if so, where does tonality emerge from?<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; Personally, I don&apos;t have any strong opinions about the emergence of<br/>&gt; &gt; tonality. Paul would probably say that if any new (compared to the<br/>&gt; &gt; unaltered scale) intervals are avoided in use then they don&apos;t count<br/>&gt; &gt; when observing his rules for tonality.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; What do you mean new intervals?</p><p>Ones not present in the unaltered scale.</p><p>&gt; &gt; &gt; I&apos;m not sure I follow - what are the basic seven degrees, the bare<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; diatonic scale? Because I hear melodic minor as being different from<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; the diatonic scale, obviously. So I&apos;m a bit confused.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; The seven degrees are more abstract entities in that they can be<br/>&gt; &gt; inflected. The minor melodies may use different inflections<br/>&gt; &gt; depending on the melodic direction. But if this inflecting is done<br/>&gt; &gt; directly by playing a tone and its&apos; chromatic inflection<br/>&gt; &gt; consecutively then the music sounds chromatic. Doesn&apos;t that make<br/>&gt; &gt; sense to you?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; OK, yes. And that&apos;s how I hear Pajara as sounding as well.</p><p>As seven alterable degrees or chromaticism or what?</p><p>&gt; Also, do you feel like these pieces do the job of being &quot;tonal?&quot;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y8MXbFtw4rM">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y8MXbFtw4rM</a><br/>&gt; <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KV_MzdtU2WQ">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KV_MzdtU2WQ</a></p><p>I hear a tonal center.

While I hear a natural minor in the 1st cadence and a harmonic minor in the 2nd, in the 3rd one there seems to be a flatted 4th degree. You may notice what is in effect a doubly-augmented fourth, which resolves out to a minor 6th. I&apos;ve been perusing the quadads in what I call the Swiss-minor scale: CDEbFbGAbBC, since it forms the basis for what has been called the Swiss augmented 6th chord: FbAbBD -&gt; EbGCEb, kind of like a misspelled Geman 6th chord. This scale is also unsymmetrical in the sense that the scale&apos;s inverse is another scale altogether which is not a mode of the first one. I&apos;ve called the the Australian scale: CD#EFGAbBC, a basis for the Australian 6th: FAbBD# -&gt; EGCE. The Australian and Swiss augmented 6th chords are mirror images of each other.

The last one sounds cool, and I like it, but I do<br/>understand what you mean in that the sharpening of the one tone and<br/>flattening of the other tone means the interval between them is closer<br/>to a fifth - not a tritone. The same thing happens in 16-equal, where<br/>if you do G7-&gt;Cmaj - and you make the B-C move by 1\16, and you also<br/>make the F-E move by 1\16 - the tritone becomes a 675 fifth, and the<br/>strength of the resolution is completely destroyed. So touche, Mr.<br/>Aho, you win this time. Foiled again!</p><p>There is one thing though - check out the mavila experiments I posted<br/>again, I saw you commented on them in Facebook:</p><p><a href="http://soundcloud.com/mikebattagliamusic/sets/the-mavila-experiments">http://soundcloud.com/mikebattagliamusic/sets/the-mavila-experiments</a></p><p>In these experiments, when you&apos;re in minor - which now has become<br/>major - and when you&apos;d normally sharpen the minor 7th to get you the<br/>leading tone, you end up flattening the now neutral 7th to get the new<br/>&quot;leading&quot; tone. That is, in mavila major, the normal 7th scale degree<br/>is 1043 cents (in 23-equal, which is what they&apos;re tuned to). Any piece<br/>that would &quot;sharpen&quot; this originally ends up flattening it, and your<br/>new altered 7th scale degree is 991 cents, meaning your &quot;leading tone&quot;<br/>becomes 208 cents. This ends up doing four things:</p><p>1) It means that the ti-do resolution now becomes the &quot;rare&quot; interval<br/>in the scale, except the rare interval is the large step or 208 cents.<br/>2) Since the leading tone is 208 cents, it also now means that the<br/>leading tone is moving by a much more consonant sounding interval than<br/>before.<br/>3) The diminished fifth now becomes 730 cents, and the augmented<br/>fourth now becomes 469 cents.<br/>4) V-i now becomes v-I.</p><p>I think that while these pieces work out nicely, the flattening of the<br/>leading tone doesn&apos;t make the resolutions sound any stronger; rather I<br/>think it makes them sound weaker. I think that, despite the fact that<br/>the leading tone ends up become the &quot;rare&quot; interval, this rare<br/>interval doesn&apos;t signal the tonic, and that if I went back to each one<br/>of these pieces and systematically changed the flattened leading tones<br/>to sharpened ones, the resolutions would sound stronger (this would be<br/>hell to do). What are your thoughts?</p><p>I should add that #3 could be changed somewhat by putting it in<br/>16-equal, where the diminished fifth would now be 750 cents, and the<br/>augmented fourth would now be 450 cents.</p><p>&gt; &gt; They don&apos;t really sound fully chromatic, not like 12-tone serialist<br/>&gt; &gt; music or anything like that. They sound, you know, mostly &quot;diatonic&quot;<br/>&gt; &gt; with some extra notes thrown in there. To be honest it just sounds<br/>&gt; &gt; like, let&apos;s call it, &quot;extended diatonic harmony,&quot; like the kind they&apos;d<br/>&gt; &gt; use in jazz standards or early 20th century pop music and so on.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; 12-tone serialism is not what &quot;chromaticism&quot; typically refers to.<br/>&gt; &quot;Mostly diatonic with some extra notes thrown in there&quot; is actually a<br/>&gt; good working definition for chromaticism.</p><p>OK, then yeah, that&apos;s what it sounds like to me.</p><p>&gt; And if you think using common practice harmony in novel temperaments<br/>&gt; is xenharmonic, then so is using &quot;extended diatonic harmony&quot; (or<br/>&gt; rather something sounding like it) in those temperaments.</p><p>You must be referring to my functional porcupine harmony examples. I<br/>think that those sound xenharmonic because the structure of the comma<br/>pump causes the very fabric of the universe to sound like it&apos;s<br/>inverting on itself, and you don&apos;t know whether up is down or down is<br/>up, and you seem to be going on a rollercoaster that&apos;s shaped like a<br/>Klein bottle, and then suddenly BAM, you&apos;re at the IV chord, IV V I.<br/>Hell yes, that&apos;s xenharmonic. On the other hand, I wouldn&apos;t say that<br/>it&apos;s the pinnacle of xenharmonicity either - it does sound a bit like<br/>boring old common practice harmony in other ways. But it was a<br/>starting point for me to explore porcupine MODAL harmony, which is<br/>definitely xenharmonic. See this -<br/><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XSfnyr1MhXE">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XSfnyr1MhXE</a></p><p>And please ignore me mumbling and screwing up the explanation, it was<br/>like 5 AM :)</p><p>Pajara offers a similar experience by way of doing tritone subs, which<br/>were definitely xenharmonic when they were first discovered in<br/>12-equal. I&apos;m just saying that I don&apos;t hear it sounding radically<br/>different, that&apos;s all, I&apos;m used to them because 12-equal already has<br/>them. I think that Pajara is great because it provides some kind of<br/>theoretical explanation for what&apos;s going on with this other sound that<br/>was discovered in 12-equal in the early 20th century. But I still<br/>can&apos;t get the hang of hearing this Pajara[10] MODMOS as offering a<br/>bold new sensory experience that I&apos;ve never heard before.</p><p>I will say one interesting thing - the Pajara standard pentachordal<br/>scale, if you reframe it as a <a href="http://2.3.5.17">2.3.5.17</a> subgroup temperament, suddenly<br/>does open up a whole new world in my mind, even though it&apos;s playable<br/>in 12-equal. You can play C C# D E all at the same time and it&apos;ll<br/>&quot;fuse&quot; very slightly (!) into 16:17:18:20. It&apos;s good enough to hint at<br/>the sound. That is, you start to hear C# as a rooted interval over the<br/>C, not as some kind of borrowed note from Phrygian or whatever. Then<br/>you can get to G# and that&apos;s a fifth up, and F# is a fifth down. It&apos;s<br/>like a new way of conceptualizing the notes in the scale. The C C# D E<br/>F F# G G# A B C mode seems to be the magical one here (all relative to<br/>12-equal, you can put it in 22-equal as you want). So maybe it&apos;s just<br/>that I&apos;m used to 7-limit harmony because the concept of hearing a<br/>dominant 7 chord as &quot;otonal&quot; was already discovered in 12-equal, but<br/>the 17-limit version was not. Just a thought. I have a recording from<br/>several years ago of the concept here:<br/><a href="http://rabbit.eng.miami.edu/students/mbattaglia/Senior_Recital/1-01%20Sand%20Prism.mp3">http://rabbit.eng.miami.edu/students/mbattaglia/Senior_Recital/1-01%20Sand%20Prism.mp3</a></p><p>It hints at 17-limit harmony in the way I&apos;m describing above.</p><p>&gt; &gt; The point with 17-equal is that it puts the small step in the diatonic<br/>&gt; &gt; scale equal around this spot, so no alteration is required. Hence<br/>&gt; &gt; 17-equal is often said to have good melodic properties (I think George<br/>&gt; &gt; Secor originally brought this point up), and that&apos;s how it sounds to<br/>&gt; &gt; me as well, and I&apos;ve never heard anyone disagree with it. Does that<br/>&gt; &gt; not seem to be true for you?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I&apos;m just skeptical about it. Is it really an interval of minimal<br/>&gt; spectral overlap or something like that?</p><p>It&apos;s an interval of nearly maximal harmonic entropy, which is<br/>obliquely related in that it means it&apos;s an interval that is maximally<br/>inharmonic. I think it&apos;s the global maximum, right? Not that I think<br/>that HE is precisely accurate enough to really model this over<br/>anyone&apos;s own hearing, but I&apos;m just pointing that out.</p><p>&gt; Doesn&apos;t that honour actually<br/>&gt; go to Phi? And if it&apos;s some local metastable interval then there are<br/>&gt; others as well and it is not singled out as something universal. The<br/>&gt; size of the steps in the third progression is right there between<br/>&gt; 1\17 and 1\19 so why doesn&apos;t it sound that great?</p><p>I don&apos;t know, but the version with the sharpened leading tone sounds<br/>stronger to my ears. It could be that the 550 cent interval sounds<br/>kind of like a fourth to my ears in the context that it&apos;s being used,<br/>whereas the raised leading tone version sounds like a tritone. Which<br/>seems to mean that the tritone works best even if we&apos;re supposed to be<br/>accepting tritones as consonant now, because they&apos;re in 7-limit<br/>tetrads, and which is also consistent with the fact that as I<br/>mentioned before using 600 cents in 22-equal ended up giving a more<br/>convincing resolution than 650 cents even for 5-limit harmony.</p><p>&gt; &gt; Do you think they would have been aware of these different effects in<br/>&gt; &gt; the musica ficta period, and that that&apos;s why they sharpened the<br/>&gt; &gt; leading tones?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; No, the period spans centuries and multiple styles starting at 12th<br/>&gt; century when there was no triadic harmony. At first the ficta were<br/>&gt; used to avoid offending intervals like tritones but soon they were<br/>&gt; also used in cadences which were dyadic progressions from imperfect<br/>&gt; to perfect consonances. As to why they did that, I don&apos;t know.</p><p>You honestly don&apos;t think that it just had a different musical feeling,<br/>the same one that caused them to sharpen it even when they started<br/>using harmony?</p><p>&gt; &gt; I do now agree with you that something about the concept of &quot;leading<br/>&gt; &gt; tone&quot; is what&apos;s important, but I&apos;m having trouble seeing the big<br/>&gt; &gt; picture.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; But I don&apos;t think leading tones are universally important to all<br/>&gt; tuning systems and in my opinion that something that is important<br/>&gt; about leading tone in the minor tonality is that the raised seventh<br/>&gt; degree produces another tritone in the scale so that we have a V7<br/>&gt; chord that leads in contrary motion to i chord, contrary motion being<br/>&gt; the strongest of motions. One of the scale degrees the tritone<br/>&gt; expands to is the tonic, that doesn&apos;t happen in the natural minor<br/>&gt; cadence.</p><p>OK, I can see that. I guess I just am not convinced of the possibility<br/>of using 550 cents as a substitute for 600 cents, that&apos;s all. Although<br/>7/5 &quot;fuses&quot; better than 11/8, there is a sense in which the former is<br/>more dissonant, and this is what makes it suitable for resolutions to<br/>my ears. I don&apos;t know what that sense is. It could be the fact that<br/>11/8, if played with the root doubled down a few bass notes, becomes<br/>something like 2:4:8:11, which is pretty simple, whereas 7/5 becomes<br/>5:10:20:28, which is less. So perhaps tonalness has to do with it.<br/>Honestly, no matter how much I listen to Pajara, I can&apos;t get into the<br/>sound of 11/8 as a characteristic dissonance, nor can I get into the<br/>sound of 8/7 as a leading tone. I&apos;ve been trying for years.</p><p>&gt; Another reason for harmonic minor was probably the need for<br/>&gt; functional symmetry between major and minor tonalities so that<br/>&gt; melodies could be modulated between major and minor with the same<br/>&gt; order of harmonic functions, one of the great dramatic techniques of<br/>&gt; common practice music.</p><p>OK, I agree with this too.</p><p>&gt; &gt; Maybe the secret is just to keep leading tones as rare intervals in<br/>&gt; &gt; the scale - this way, they aren&apos;t played so much that you get<br/>&gt; &gt; desensitized to them, and also the rare intervals are also leading<br/>&gt; &gt; tones inasmuch as they carry minimal spectral overlap. In fact, this<br/>&gt; &gt; seems to be what I naturally like about the scales that I said were<br/>&gt; &gt; awesome - Keemun[7] and Father[8]. Keemun is 4L3s, and Father is 5L3s,<br/>&gt; &gt; and both of them consist of nice smooth whole tones with some jarring<br/>&gt; &gt; leading tones to fracture the scale up thrown in there. And I notice<br/>&gt; &gt; that although the large steps are rare in Mavila[7], they&apos;re<br/>&gt; &gt; definitely not ideal leading tones (although Mavila is nice for other<br/>&gt; &gt; reasons).<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Maybe Mavila should be tuned so that the large step is some local<br/>&gt; interval of minimal spectral overlap?</p><p>Maybe, but I think it&apos;s also about dissonance - the local maximum of<br/>harmonic entropy between 9/8 and 8/7 just doesn&apos;t sound as dissonant<br/>to me as 25/24 does. But this is the mysterious part of the<br/>&quot;categorical perception&quot; of intervals that we labeled the &quot;Big<br/>Masturbatory Theoretical Question&quot; last week, so I don&apos;t think anyone<br/>has the answer. I&apos;m not entirely sure it has anything to do with<br/>harmonic entropy. I&apos;ve just noticed that if you&apos;re in 19-equal,<br/>sharpening the leading tone by 1\19 makes it a million times more<br/>convincing, and also happens to push the leading tone towards the<br/>global maximum of HE. Perhaps it&apos;s a false correlation.</p><p>&gt; &gt; &gt; <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flamenco#Harmony">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flamenco#Harmony</a><br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; In what sense do you mean that the function is &quot;dominant?&quot;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Creating an instability that strongly suggests the tonic as the most<br/>&gt; satisfying resolution.</p><p>OK. Perhaps that&apos;s been the cause of some confusion, because to me the<br/>dominant means the v or V chord, and subdominant means the iv or IV<br/>chord.</p><p>&gt; In this context subdominant has multiple meanings that can be<br/>&gt; dissociated: a chord that has the tonic as its&apos; dominant, predominant<br/>&gt; etc. But how we name the functions is not that important, my point is<br/>&gt; that harmonic functions should not be equated with scale degrees or<br/>&gt; root relations.</p><p>OK, fair enough.</p><p>&gt; &gt; Hmm... perhaps I need to go through and read it again. But to be<br/>&gt; &gt; honest, in the porcupine examples I laid out in 22-equal, setting the<br/>&gt; &gt; dominant chord equal to 4:5:6:7 made it resolve more strongly than<br/>&gt; &gt; setting it to 1/1 5/4 3/2 9/5, whatever that might be. The latter is<br/>&gt; &gt; more dissonant, but the 9/5 on top resolving to the 5/4 of the I chord<br/>&gt; &gt; was much weaker than the 7/4 resolving, despite that the first one had<br/>&gt; &gt; the diminished fifth as 16/11 on top (which Paul chose as being more<br/>&gt; &gt; dissonant than 7/5), and the second had it as 7/5. But the first one<br/>&gt; &gt; gives you a better leading tone, which is more dissonant than any of<br/>&gt; &gt; these intervals.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; The ~5:7 in 22-equal is identical to the tritone we are used to in<br/>&gt; 12-equal and the tritone is the characteristic dissonance of the<br/>&gt; diatonic scale.</p><p>If 650 cents is supposed to be more dissonant than 600 cents,<br/>shouldn&apos;t it work even better? But that&apos;s not the case. And why does<br/>it seem to be universally accepted that 17-equal has better melodic<br/>properties than 12-equal, a better leading tone, etc? What I&apos;m saying<br/>is, if it was really 100% about learning, why this consistent response<br/>towards 17-equal? There does seem to be some kind of way to make<br/>things resolve &quot;even more,&quot; and that approach isn&apos;t met by changing<br/>600 cents to 650 cents in 22-equal, but it is when you move to<br/>17-equal which has a tritone of 635 cents and a leading tone of 60<br/>cents. Why...? I seriously don&apos;t know.</p><p>&gt; &gt; &gt; The seven degrees are more abstract entities in that they can be<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; inflected. The minor melodies may use different inflections<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; depending on the melodic direction. But if this inflecting is done<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; directly by playing a tone and its&apos; chromatic inflection<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; consecutively then the music sounds chromatic. Doesn&apos;t that make<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; sense to you?<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; OK, yes. And that&apos;s how I hear Pajara as sounding as well.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; As seven alterable degrees or chromaticism or what?</p><p>Both.</p><p>&gt; &gt; Also, do you feel like these pieces do the job of being &quot;tonal?&quot;<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y8MXbFtw4rM">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y8MXbFtw4rM</a><br/>&gt; &gt; <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KV_MzdtU2WQ">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KV_MzdtU2WQ</a><br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I hear a tonal center. Does that suffice? I don&apos;t know. It also sounds<br/>&gt; modal in the sense of not being in traditional major or minor.</p><p>It does suffice, yes. It&apos;s basically the mavila equivalent of this<br/>meantone progression:</p><p>Cmaj | Gmaj | Am | Gmaj | Bb | Fmaj | Cmaj</p><p>Except since we&apos;re in mavila, the Bb becomes a B. That is, you can<br/>think of Gmaj as V, and the Bb/F as IV/IV. In meantone, when V moves<br/>to IV/IV, the root goes up by 6/5. In mavila, instead, it goes by 5/4.<br/>So the roots in the mavila version are C - G - A - G - B - F - C,<br/>where B-F is still 3/2.</p><p>I also play this comma pump in mavila that&apos;s like Cmaj - Emaj - Bmaj -<br/>Fmaj, again where B-F is 3/2. So it&apos;s like a mavila I III VII IV.</p><p>My question is, now that I&apos;ve explained the progression, would you say<br/>that the mavila one sounds &quot;modal&quot; and the meantone one sounds<br/>&quot;tonal?&quot; Or that they both sound modal, or that they both sound tonal?<br/>To my ears, they both sound tonal, with this one colorful IV/IV thrown<br/>in there.</p><p>-Mike</p></div><h3>Kalle Aho &#x3C;kalleaho@...&#x3E;</h3><span>7/6/2011 7:44:26 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, Mike Battaglia &lt;battaglia01@...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt; On Thu, Jun 16, 2011 at 4:05 PM, Kalle Aho &lt;kalleaho@...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; I don&apos;t use MIDI files.

So touche, Mr.<br/>&gt; Aho, you win this time. Foiled again!<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; There is one thing though - check out the mavila experiments I posted<br/>&gt; again, I saw you commented on them in Facebook:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; <a href="http://soundcloud.com/mikebattagliamusic/sets/the-mavila-experiments">http://soundcloud.com/mikebattagliamusic/sets/the-mavila-experiments</a><br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; In these experiments, when you&apos;re in minor - which now has become<br/>&gt; major - and when you&apos;d normally sharpen the minor 7th to get you the<br/>&gt; leading tone, you end up flattening the now neutral 7th to get the new<br/>&gt; &quot;leading&quot; tone. That is, in mavila major, the normal 7th scale degree<br/>&gt; is 1043 cents (in 23-equal, which is what they&apos;re tuned to). Any piece<br/>&gt; that would &quot;sharpen&quot; this originally ends up flattening it, and your<br/>&gt; new altered 7th scale degree is 991 cents, meaning your &quot;leading tone&quot;<br/>&gt; becomes 208 cents. This ends up doing four things:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; 1) It means that the ti-do resolution now becomes the &quot;rare&quot; interval<br/>&gt; in the scale, except the rare interval is the large step or 208 cents.<br/>&gt; 2) Since the leading tone is 208 cents, it also now means that the<br/>&gt; leading tone is moving by a much more consonant sounding interval than<br/>&gt; before.</p><p>Are you saying that a melodic (i.e. tones are successive, not<br/>simultaneous) interval can sound consonant/dissonant? That might<br/>happen in arpeggiated chords but what about melodic movements by<br/>step? I don&apos;t feel that there is anything consonant or dissonant<br/>about them.</p><p>&gt; 3) The diminished fifth now becomes 730 cents, and the augmented<br/>&gt; fourth now becomes 469 cents.<br/>&gt; 4) V-i now becomes v-I.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I think that while these pieces work out nicely, the flattening of the<br/>&gt; leading tone doesn&apos;t make the resolutions sound any stronger; rather I<br/>&gt; think it makes them sound weaker. I think that, despite the fact that<br/>&gt; the leading tone ends up become the &quot;rare&quot; interval, this rare<br/>&gt; interval doesn&apos;t signal the tonic, and that if I went back to each one<br/>&gt; of these pieces and systematically changed the flattened leading tones<br/>&gt; to sharpened ones, the resolutions would sound stronger (this would be<br/>&gt; hell to do). What are your thoughts?</p><p>Maybe. The pieces sound fine as they are now though. Could you make<br/>some simple example where the effects of flattening and sharpening<br/>are compared, perhaps a phrase from one of the example pieces?</p><p>&gt; I should add that #3 could be changed somewhat by putting it in<br/>&gt; 16-equal, where the diminished fifth would now be 750 cents, and the<br/>&gt; augmented fourth would now be 450 cents.</p><p>It bothers me that none of the optimal tuning methods we have<br/>considers the tuning of the dissonances, they just let them land<br/>where they may. For example, in TOP Mavila the characteristic<br/>dissonance is closer to 2:3 than the Mavila fifth and that&apos;s just<br/>wrong!</p><p>&gt; &gt; And if you think using common practice harmony in novel temperaments<br/>&gt; &gt; is xenharmonic, then so is using &quot;extended diatonic harmony&quot; (or<br/>&gt; &gt; rather something sounding like it) in those temperaments.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; You must be referring to my functional porcupine harmony examples. I<br/>&gt; think that those sound xenharmonic because the structure of the comma<br/>&gt; pump causes the very fabric of the universe to sound like it&apos;s<br/>&gt; inverting on itself, and you don&apos;t know whether up is down or down is<br/>&gt; up, and you seem to be going on a rollercoaster that&apos;s shaped like a<br/>&gt; Klein bottle, and then suddenly BAM, you&apos;re at the IV chord, IV V I.<br/>&gt; Hell yes, that&apos;s xenharmonic. On the other hand, I wouldn&apos;t say that<br/>&gt; it&apos;s the pinnacle of xenharmonicity either - it does sound a bit like<br/>&gt; boring old common practice harmony in other ways. But it was a<br/>&gt; starting point for me to explore porcupine MODAL harmony, which is<br/>&gt; definitely xenharmonic. See this -<br/>&gt; <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XSfnyr1MhXE">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XSfnyr1MhXE</a><br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; And please ignore me mumbling and screwing up the explanation, it was<br/>&gt; like 5 AM :)<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Pajara offers a similar experience by way of doing tritone subs, which<br/>&gt; were definitely xenharmonic when they were first discovered in<br/>&gt; 12-equal. I&apos;m just saying that I don&apos;t hear it sounding radically<br/>&gt; different, that&apos;s all, I&apos;m used to them because 12-equal already has<br/>&gt; them. I think that Pajara is great because it provides some kind of<br/>&gt; theoretical explanation for what&apos;s going on with this other sound that<br/>&gt; was discovered in 12-equal in the early 20th century. But I still<br/>&gt; can&apos;t get the hang of hearing this Pajara[10] MODMOS as offering a<br/>&gt; bold new sensory experience that I&apos;ve never heard before.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I will say one interesting thing - the Pajara standard pentachordal<br/>&gt; scale, if you reframe it as a <a href="http://2.3.5.17">2.3.5.17</a> subgroup temperament, suddenly<br/>&gt; does open up a whole new world in my mind, even though it&apos;s playable<br/>&gt; in 12-equal. You can play C C# D E all at the same time and it&apos;ll<br/>&gt; &quot;fuse&quot; very slightly (!) into 16:17:18:20. It&apos;s good enough to hint at<br/>&gt; the sound. That is, you start to hear C# as a rooted interval over the<br/>&gt; C, not as some kind of borrowed note from Phrygian or whatever. Then<br/>&gt; you can get to G# and that&apos;s a fifth up, and F# is a fifth down. It&apos;s<br/>&gt; like a new way of conceptualizing the notes in the scale. The C C# D E<br/>&gt; F F# G G# A B C mode seems to be the magical one here (all relative to<br/>&gt; 12-equal, you can put it in 22-equal as you want). So maybe it&apos;s just<br/>&gt; that I&apos;m used to 7-limit harmony because the concept of hearing a<br/>&gt; dominant 7 chord as &quot;otonal&quot; was already discovered in 12-equal, but<br/>&gt; the 17-limit version was not. Just a thought. I have a recording from<br/>&gt; several years ago of the concept here:<br/>&gt; <a href="http://rabbit.eng.miami.edu/students/mbattaglia/Senior_Recital/1-01%20Sand%20Prism.mp3">http://rabbit.eng.miami.edu/students/mbattaglia/Senior_Recital/1-01%20Sand%20Prism.mp3</a><br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; It hints at 17-limit harmony in the way I&apos;m describing above.</p><p>The Pajara temperament itself is moderately xenharmonic because it<br/>doesn&apos;t temper out 35:36 or 80:81 and while Pajara[10] is in a sense<br/>a better tuned version of something already found in 12-equal,<br/>12-equal doesn&apos;t contain the characteristic dissonances found in<br/>22-equal and 2D Pajara although we may disagree about their<br/>importance.</p><p>BTW, I&apos;m not really a xenharmonic thrills junkie like you because<br/>that lifestyle will ultimately disappoint. You are just going to seek<br/>weirder and weirder comma pumps and become a recluse because your<br/>dopaminergic xenharmonicity neurons will only fire when you hear<br/>something that respectful people can&apos;t even comprehend or stomach!</p><p>&gt; &gt; &gt; The point with 17-equal is that it puts the small step in the diatonic<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; scale equal around this spot, so no alteration is required. Hence<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; 17-equal is often said to have good melodic properties (I think George<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; Secor originally brought this point up), and that&apos;s how it sounds to<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; me as well, and I&apos;ve never heard anyone disagree with it. Does that<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; not seem to be true for you?<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; I&apos;m just skeptical about it. Is it really an interval of minimal<br/>&gt; &gt; spectral overlap or something like that?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; It&apos;s an interval of nearly maximal harmonic entropy, which is<br/>&gt; obliquely related in that it means it&apos;s an interval that is maximally<br/>&gt; inharmonic. I think it&apos;s the global maximum, right? Not that I think<br/>&gt; that HE is precisely accurate enough to really model this over<br/>&gt; anyone&apos;s own hearing, but I&apos;m just pointing that out.</p><p>You keep on talking as if this idea of melodic intervals sounding<br/>dissonant or consonant was common music theory parlance. And it is<br/>not clear to me by what mechanism this would aid in establishing<br/>tonality.</p><p>&gt; &gt; Doesn&apos;t that honour actually<br/>&gt; &gt; go to Phi? And if it&apos;s some local metastable interval then there are<br/>&gt; &gt; others as well and it is not singled out as something universal. The<br/>&gt; &gt; size of the steps in the third progression is right there between<br/>&gt; &gt; 1\17 and 1\19 so why doesn&apos;t it sound that great?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I don&apos;t know, but the version with the sharpened leading tone sounds<br/>&gt; stronger to my ears. It could be that the 550 cent interval sounds<br/>&gt; kind of like a fourth to my ears in the context that it&apos;s being used,<br/>&gt; whereas the raised leading tone version sounds like a tritone. Which<br/>&gt; seems to mean that the tritone works best even if we&apos;re supposed to be<br/>&gt; accepting tritones as consonant now, because they&apos;re in 7-limit<br/>&gt; tetrads, and which is also consistent with the fact that as I<br/>&gt; mentioned before using 600 cents in 22-equal ended up giving a more<br/>&gt; convincing resolution than 650 cents even for 5-limit harmony.</p><p>See below (as you essentially wrote the same thing twice).</p><p>&gt; &gt; &gt; Do you think they would have been aware of these different effects in<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; the musica ficta period, and that that&apos;s why they sharpened the<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; leading tones?<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; No, the period spans centuries and multiple styles starting at 12th<br/>&gt; &gt; century when there was no triadic harmony. At first the ficta were<br/>&gt; &gt; used to avoid offending intervals like tritones but soon they were<br/>&gt; &gt; also used in cadences which were dyadic progressions from imperfect<br/>&gt; &gt; to perfect consonances. As to why they did that, I don&apos;t know.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; You honestly don&apos;t think that it just had a different musical feeling,<br/>&gt; the same one that caused them to sharpen it even when they started<br/>&gt; using harmony?</p><p>Of course it had a different musical feeling but just having a<br/>different musical feeling is not sufficient reason to sharpen<br/>consistently. Just having a different musical feeling would imply<br/>sometimes sharpening and sometimes not, just for variety&apos;s sake,<br/>don&apos;t you think?</p><p>&quot;Started using harmony&quot;? Harmony was already in use way before this<br/>sharpening started.</p><p>&gt; &gt; &gt; I do now agree with you that something about the concept of &quot;leading<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; tone&quot; is what&apos;s important, but I&apos;m having trouble seeing the big<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; picture.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; But I don&apos;t think leading tones are universally important to all<br/>&gt; &gt; tuning systems and in my opinion that something that is important<br/>&gt; &gt; about leading tone in the minor tonality is that the raised seventh<br/>&gt; &gt; degree produces another tritone in the scale so that we have a V7<br/>&gt; &gt; chord that leads in contrary motion to i chord, contrary motion being<br/>&gt; &gt; the strongest of motions. One of the scale degrees the tritone<br/>&gt; &gt; expands to is the tonic, that doesn&apos;t happen in the natural minor<br/>&gt; &gt; cadence.</p><p>Adding to this: the two tritones also produce a diminished seventh<br/>chord and that is something extremely common in common practice minor<br/>tonality, often replacing the V7 in function even though it&apos;s most<br/>often &quot;rooted&quot; on the raised seventh degree of harmonic minor.</p><p>&gt; OK, I can see that. I guess I just am not convinced of the possibility<br/>&gt; of using 550 cents as a substitute for 600 cents, that&apos;s all. Although<br/>&gt; 7/5 &quot;fuses&quot; better than 11/8, there is a sense in which the former is<br/>&gt; more dissonant, and this is what makes it suitable for resolutions to<br/>&gt; my ears. I don&apos;t know what that sense is. It could be the fact that<br/>&gt; 11/8, if played with the root doubled down a few bass notes, becomes<br/>&gt; something like 2:4:8:11, which is pretty simple, whereas 7/5 becomes<br/>&gt; 5:10:20:28, which is less. So perhaps tonalness has to do with it.<br/>&gt; Honestly, no matter how much I listen to Pajara, I can&apos;t get into the<br/>&gt; sound of 11/8 as a characteristic dissonance, nor can I get into the<br/>&gt; sound of 8/7 as a leading tone. I&apos;ve been trying for years.</p><p>I&apos;m using TOP Pajara in my example and the characteristic dissonance<br/>is 532.833 cents which is more like 11:15 than 8:11. Also the rare<br/>interval in Pajara is not the ~7:8. It&apos;s an ~9:10.</p><p>&gt; &gt; &gt; In what sense do you mean that the function is &quot;dominant?&quot;<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; Creating an instability that strongly suggests the tonic as the most<br/>&gt; &gt; satisfying resolution.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; OK. Perhaps that&apos;s been the cause of some confusion, because to me the<br/>&gt; dominant means the v or V chord, and subdominant means the iv or IV<br/>&gt; chord.</p><p>What about theorists who regard both IV and ii as subdominant<br/>(or predominant) and both V and vii as dominant? That&apos;s pretty common<br/>in German music theory.</p><p>&gt; &gt; &gt; Hmm... perhaps I need to go through and read it again. But to be<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; honest, in the porcupine examples I laid out in 22-equal, setting the<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; dominant chord equal to 4:5:6:7 made it resolve more strongly than<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; setting it to 1/1 5/4 3/2 9/5, whatever that might be. The latter is<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; more dissonant, but the 9/5 on top resolving to the 5/4 of the I chord<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; was much weaker than the 7/4 resolving, despite that the first one had<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; the diminished fifth as 16/11 on top (which Paul chose as being more<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; dissonant than 7/5), and the second had it as 7/5. But the first one<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; gives you a better leading tone, which is more dissonant than any of<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; these intervals.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; The ~5:7 in 22-equal is identical to the tritone we are used to in<br/>&gt; &gt; 12-equal and the tritone is the characteristic dissonance of the<br/>&gt; &gt; diatonic scale.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; If 650 cents is supposed to be more dissonant than 600 cents,<br/>&gt; shouldn&apos;t it work even better? But that&apos;s not the case. And why does<br/>&gt; it seem to be universally accepted that 17-equal has better melodic<br/>&gt; properties than 12-equal, a better leading tone, etc? What I&apos;m saying<br/>&gt; is, if it was really 100% about learning, why this consistent response<br/>&gt; towards 17-equal? There does seem to be some kind of way to make<br/>&gt; things resolve &quot;even more,&quot; and that approach isn&apos;t met by changing<br/>&gt; 600 cents to 650 cents in 22-equal, but it is when you move to<br/>&gt; 17-equal which has a tritone of 635 cents and a leading tone of 60<br/>&gt; cents. Why...? I seriously don&apos;t know.</p><p>I hear 1/1 5/4 3/2 9/5 as more dissonant but it sounds very different<br/>from a typical meantone V-I so that might influence our judgment.<br/>Maybe it&apos;s just not convincing as a meantone-like V-I, whatever<br/>merits it has outside that context.</p><p>&gt; &gt; &gt; Also, do you feel like these pieces do the job of being &quot;tonal?&quot;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y8MXbFtw4rM">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y8MXbFtw4rM</a><br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KV_MzdtU2WQ">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KV_MzdtU2WQ</a><br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; I hear a tonal center.

Modal music is tonal in the sense of having a<br/>tonal center but &apos;tonal&apos; probably should mean something more than<br/>just having a tonal center.</p><p>&gt; It&apos;s basically the mavila equivalent of this meantone progression:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Cmaj | Gmaj | Am | Gmaj | Bb | Fmaj | Cmaj</p><p>That second Gmaj doesn&apos;t sound like a structurally important chord,<br/>it&apos;s more like a passing chord. Just pointing out.</p><p>&gt; Except since we&apos;re in mavila, the Bb becomes a B. That is, you can<br/>&gt; think of Gmaj as V, and the Bb/F as IV/IV. In meantone, when V moves<br/>&gt; to IV/IV, the root goes up by 6/5. In mavila, instead, it goes by 5/4.<br/>&gt; So the roots in the mavila version are C - G - A - G - B - F - C,<br/>&gt; where B-F is still 3/2.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I also play this comma pump in mavila that&apos;s like Cmaj - Emaj - Bmaj -<br/>&gt; Fmaj, again where B-F is 3/2. So it&apos;s like a mavila I III VII IV.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; My question is, now that I&apos;ve explained the progression, would you say<br/>&gt; that the mavila one sounds &quot;modal&quot; and the meantone one sounds<br/>&gt; &quot;tonal?&quot; Or that they both sound modal, or that they both sound tonal?<br/>&gt; To my ears, they both sound tonal, with this one colorful IV/IV thrown<br/>&gt; in there.</p><p>They both sound more modal than tonal to me but I hear that IV/IV as<br/>sticking out so maybe there is some sense of chords belonging or not<br/>belonging to a key.</p><p>Kalle</p></div><h3>Mike Battaglia &#x3C;battaglia01@...&#x3E;</h3><span>7/6/2011 9:58:18 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>On Wed, Jul 6, 2011 at 10:44 AM, Kalle Aho &lt;kalleaho@...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; Alright, after listening to this with a clear head, the second one is<br/>&gt; &gt; strongest to me.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; To me there is something unsatisfactory in the second one, I hear the<br/>&gt; first one as the strongest.</p><p>They&apos;re both great to me.

That might<br/>&gt; happen in arpeggiated chords but what about melodic movements by<br/>&gt; step? I don&apos;t feel that there is anything consonant or dissonant<br/>&gt; about them.</p><p>Yes, I am saying that. Sooner or later I&apos;m confident people will admit<br/>it as well. When you arpeggiate C-E-G, it&apos;s more consonant than if you<br/>arpeggiate C-Eb-Gb. When you arpeggiate Bb-C-D-F, it&apos;s more consonant<br/>than if you arpeggiate Bb-B-D-F. When you arpeggiate Bb-C-D, it&apos;s more<br/>consonant than if you arpeggiate Bb-B-C. And even if we&apos;re talking<br/>about just two notes, if you arpeggiate Bb-C, it&apos;s more consonant than<br/>if you arpeggiate Bb-B.</p><p>&gt; &gt; I think that while these pieces work out nicely, the flattening of the<br/>&gt; &gt; leading tone doesn&apos;t make the resolutions sound any stronger; rather I<br/>&gt; &gt; think it makes them sound weaker. I think that, despite the fact that<br/>&gt; &gt; the leading tone ends up become the &quot;rare&quot; interval, this rare<br/>&gt; &gt; interval doesn&apos;t signal the tonic, and that if I went back to each one<br/>&gt; &gt; of these pieces and systematically changed the flattened leading tones<br/>&gt; &gt; to sharpened ones, the resolutions would sound stronger (this would be<br/>&gt; &gt; hell to do). What are your thoughts?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Maybe. The pieces sound fine as they are now though.</p><p>It also sounds fine if you replace every V-i resolution in a piece of<br/>classical music with v-i. It&apos;ll sound different, but it won&apos;t sound<br/>un-fine, especially if you listen to it a hundred times and get used<br/>to it.</p><p>&gt; Could you make<br/>&gt; some simple example where the effects of flattening and sharpening<br/>&gt; are compared, perhaps a phrase from one of the example pieces?</p><p>I&apos;ve been meaning to do this for a while, but have no time right now,<br/>sorry. I&apos;ll try messing with Fur Elise when I get the chance.</p><p>&gt; &gt; I should add that #3 could be changed somewhat by putting it in<br/>&gt; &gt; 16-equal, where the diminished fifth would now be 750 cents, and the<br/>&gt; &gt; augmented fourth would now be 450 cents.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; It bothers me that none of the optimal tuning methods we have<br/>&gt; considers the tuning of the dissonances, they just let them land<br/>&gt; where they may. For example, in TOP Mavila the characteristic<br/>&gt; dissonance is closer to 2:3 than the Mavila fifth and that&apos;s just<br/>&gt; wrong!</p><p>Yeah. Got to go by ear, I guess. I think 25-equal might be melodically<br/>ideal for Mavila in a certain sense.</p><p>&gt; &gt; It hints at 17-limit harmony in the way I&apos;m describing above.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; The Pajara temperament itself is moderately xenharmonic because it<br/>&gt; doesn&apos;t temper out 35:36 or 80:81 and while Pajara[10] is in a sense<br/>&gt; a better tuned version of something already found in 12-equal,<br/>&gt; 12-equal doesn&apos;t contain the characteristic dissonances found in<br/>&gt; 22-equal and 2D Pajara although we may disagree about their<br/>&gt; importance.</p><p>The characteristic dissonance in the version you posted was 532 cents,<br/>which as a mavila and 9-ET junkie is alright with me.</p><p>What I&apos;m saying is that my brain has snapped instantly into<br/>mavila-tonality mode, and it hasn&apos;t yet for Pajara-tonality mode. Why?</p><p>&gt; BTW, I&apos;m not really a xenharmonic thrills junkie like you because<br/>&gt; that lifestyle will ultimately disappoint. You are just going to seek<br/>&gt; weirder and weirder comma pumps and become a recluse because your<br/>&gt; dopaminergic xenharmonicity neurons will only fire when you hear<br/>&gt; something that respectful people can&apos;t even comprehend or stomach!</p><p>That sounds like me now...</p><p>&gt; &gt; It&apos;s an interval of nearly maximal harmonic entropy, which is<br/>&gt; &gt; obliquely related in that it means it&apos;s an interval that is maximally<br/>&gt; &gt; inharmonic. I think it&apos;s the global maximum, right? Not that I think<br/>&gt; &gt; that HE is precisely accurate enough to really model this over<br/>&gt; &gt; anyone&apos;s own hearing, but I&apos;m just pointing that out.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; You keep on talking as if this idea of melodic intervals sounding<br/>&gt; dissonant or consonant was common music theory parlance. And it is<br/>&gt; not clear to me by what mechanism this would aid in establishing<br/>&gt; tonality.</p><p>Arpeggiated chords can be consonant or dissonant, and arpeggiated<br/>dyads can be consonant or dissonant too, just like chords and dyads<br/>themselves can be when the notes are played simultaneously. But I&apos;m<br/>basically throwing ideas out, because for me, Mavila works and Pajara<br/>doesn&apos;t. This is an extrapolation of the George Secor 17-equal optimal<br/>leading tone thing. But I&apos;ve since changed my mind about a few things<br/>since I&apos;ve written this.</p><p>I have a question for you: why do you think that all of this stuff<br/>with rare interval sizes and characteristic dissonances matters? In my<br/>experience, my brain, for your example, has smashed the characteristic<br/>dissonance into the &quot;perfect fourth&quot; category. Clearly the dissonance<br/>of 533 cents alone is not enough to signal my brain to the fact that<br/>this is some kind of hot potato &quot;avoid&quot; interval that needs to<br/>disappear after it&apos;s played. The notion that I will be able to learn<br/>to hear it that way after &quot;just a little more training&quot; is<br/>unfalsifiable. What do I do to learn to hear Pajara tonality? Do you<br/>really hear some kind of radical switch when the decatonic scale is<br/>played?</p><p>In fact, I&apos;ll post an experiment up sometime when I have a second to<br/>think: where a piece of music gets dynamically retuned from 12-equal<br/>to 17-equal to 22-equal to 27-equal all the way up to 42-equal and<br/>then 5-equal, with the fifth getting wider each time and L:s<br/>increasing in the diatonic scale. When you get to 5-equal, you can<br/>still hear 0-480-720 as a really stretched major chord and 0-240-720<br/>as a minor chord after that epic buildup. At the 5-equal point, the<br/>fact that s now equals 0 leads to some distortions of perception, but<br/>not as much before that, even when the difference between a major<br/>third and a perfect fourth is like 28 cents. So consonance and<br/>dissonance doesn&apos;t act like a signal for anything to my brain.</p><p>Perhaps some kind of initial exposure to consonance and dissonance<br/>would do the trick to &quot;burn&quot; the categorical perception into my brain,<br/>and then I&apos;ll be able to recognize the pattern in subsequent<br/>exposures. Perhaps a different tuning for Pajara would make it sound<br/>different, something like 22-equal or even 32 perhaps.</p><p>&gt; &gt; You honestly don&apos;t think that it just had a different musical feeling,<br/>&gt; &gt; the same one that caused them to sharpen it even when they started<br/>&gt; &gt; using harmony?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Of course it had a different musical feeling but just having a<br/>&gt; different musical feeling is not sufficient reason to sharpen<br/>&gt; consistently. Just having a different musical feeling would imply<br/>&gt; sometimes sharpening and sometimes not, just for variety&apos;s sake,<br/>&gt; don&apos;t you think?</p><p>Which is exactly what people have since started doing, to add variety.<br/>I reference you to noted music theorists Earth Wind and Fire, with the<br/>use of the minor v chord:</p><p><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_XOY7lsBVpo">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_XOY7lsBVpo</a></p><p>And &quot;Louie Louie&quot;</p><p><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Vae_AkLb4Q">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Vae_AkLb4Q</a></p><p>etc. They could have also used Dorian and Phrygian and such, but<br/>didn&apos;t. Or they could have stuck with Aeolian and used bVII7, as<br/>Celtic folk music does, all of which to add variety. Why not? That<br/>wasn&apos;t the feeling that was in style at the time.</p><p>&gt; &gt; OK, I can see that. I guess I just am not convinced of the possibility<br/>&gt; &gt; of using 550 cents as a substitute for 600 cents, that&apos;s all. Although<br/>&gt; &gt; 7/5 &quot;fuses&quot; better than 11/8, there is a sense in which the former is<br/>&gt; &gt; more dissonant, and this is what makes it suitable for resolutions to<br/>&gt; &gt; my ears. I don&apos;t know what that sense is. It could be the fact that<br/>&gt; &gt; 11/8, if played with the root doubled down a few bass notes, becomes<br/>&gt; &gt; something like 2:4:8:11, which is pretty simple, whereas 7/5 becomes<br/>&gt; &gt; 5:10:20:28, which is less. So perhaps tonalness has to do with it.<br/>&gt; &gt; Honestly, no matter how much I listen to Pajara, I can&apos;t get into the<br/>&gt; &gt; sound of 11/8 as a characteristic dissonance, nor can I get into the<br/>&gt; &gt; sound of 8/7 as a leading tone. I&apos;ve been trying for years.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I&apos;m using TOP Pajara in my example and the characteristic dissonance<br/>&gt; is 532.833 cents which is more like 11:15 than 8:11. Also the rare<br/>&gt; interval in Pajara is not the ~7:8. It&apos;s an ~9:10.</p><p>Sorry, I meant 10/9 for the rare interval. But I thought this was<br/>22-equal - maybe the fact that the dissonance is only 533 cents has<br/>something to do with it.</p><p>&gt; &gt; OK. Perhaps that&apos;s been the cause of some confusion, because to me the<br/>&gt; &gt; dominant means the v or V chord, and subdominant means the iv or IV<br/>&gt; &gt; chord.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; What about theorists who regard both IV and ii as subdominant<br/>&gt; (or predominant) and both V and vii as dominant? That&apos;s pretty common<br/>&gt; in German music theory.</p><p>OK, we can call it that too. I just want to make sure we&apos;re talking<br/>about the same thing.</p><p>&gt; &gt; If 650 cents is supposed to be more dissonant than 600 cents,<br/>&gt; &gt; shouldn&apos;t it work even better? But that&apos;s not the case. And why does<br/>&gt; &gt; it seem to be universally accepted that 17-equal has better melodic<br/>&gt; &gt; properties than 12-equal, a better leading tone, etc? What I&apos;m saying<br/>&gt; &gt; is, if it was really 100% about learning, why this consistent response<br/>&gt; &gt; towards 17-equal? There does seem to be some kind of way to make<br/>&gt; &gt; things resolve &quot;even more,&quot; and that approach isn&apos;t met by changing<br/>&gt; &gt; 600 cents to 650 cents in 22-equal, but it is when you move to<br/>&gt; &gt; 17-equal which has a tritone of 635 cents and a leading tone of 60<br/>&gt; &gt; cents. Why...? I seriously don&apos;t know.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I hear 1/1 5/4 3/2 9/5 as more dissonant but it sounds very different<br/>&gt; from a typical meantone V-I so that might influence our judgment.<br/>&gt; Maybe it&apos;s just not convincing as a meantone-like V-I, whatever<br/>&gt; merits it has outside that context.</p><p>And I think that the thing about it that sounds different is that it<br/>doesn&apos;t resolve as well.</p><p>&gt; &gt; &gt; I hear a tonal center. Does that suffice? I don&apos;t know. It also sounds<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; modal in the sense of not being in traditional major or minor.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; It does suffice, yes.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Why are you so sure? Modal music is tonal in the sense of having a<br/>&gt; tonal center but &apos;tonal&apos; probably should mean something more than<br/>&gt; just having a tonal center.</p><p>I was taught that tonality is when you perceive the pitches in a piece<br/>of music as being organized around one central, main pitch, which is<br/>the &quot;key.&quot; That&apos;s what it means to me. Other than that, people seem to<br/>use the word to denote a piece of music that has that feature, but<br/>that lacks the &quot;variety&quot; that you mentioned above and sticks only to<br/>the common practice&apos;s harmonic vocabulary. I doubt the use of IV/IV<br/>destroyed the perception of the piece having a tonal center for you,<br/>and I&apos;m sure that no matter how far out I went with this piece, it<br/>would still sound to you like C was the key the song is in. But the<br/>use of IV/IV is a departure from the common practice norm.</p><p>&gt; &gt; It&apos;s basically the mavila equivalent of this meantone progression:<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; Cmaj | Gmaj | Am | Gmaj | Bb | Fmaj | Cmaj<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; That second Gmaj doesn&apos;t sound like a structurally important chord,<br/>&gt; it&apos;s more like a passing chord. Just pointing out.</p><p>It is.</p><p>&gt; &gt; My question is, now that I&apos;ve explained the progression, would you say<br/>&gt; &gt; that the mavila one sounds &quot;modal&quot; and the meantone one sounds<br/>&gt; &gt; &quot;tonal?&quot; Or that they both sound modal, or that they both sound tonal?<br/>&gt; &gt; To my ears, they both sound tonal, with this one colorful IV/IV thrown<br/>&gt; &gt; in there.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; They both sound more modal than tonal to me but I hear that IV/IV as<br/>&gt; sticking out so maybe there is some sense of chords belonging or not<br/>&gt; belonging to a key.</p><p>OK. Well, I don&apos;t hear it that way. I hear the IV/IV as a temporary<br/>modulation in the same way that I hear meantone Cm -&gt; Bbmaj -&gt; Abmaj<br/>-&gt; Gmaj -&gt; Cmaj as containing a modulation when the Bb in the Bbmaj is<br/>supplanted by the B natural in the Gmaj. It doesn&apos;t destroy the<br/>perception that C is a tonal center in any event.</p><p>-Mike</p></div><h3>lobawad &#x3C;lobawad@...&#x3E;</h3><span>7/7/2011 2:51:28 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, Mike Battaglia &lt;battaglia01@...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; On Wed, Jul 6, 2011 at 10:44 AM, Kalle Aho &lt;kalleaho@...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; Alright, after listening to this with a clear head, the second one is<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; strongest to me.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; To me there is something unsatisfactory in the second one, I hear the<br/>&gt; &gt; first one as the strongest.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; They&apos;re both great to me.

Do you<br/>&gt; really hear some kind of radical switch when the decatonic scale is<br/>&gt; played?</p><p>It matters because to me both the diatonic scale and the decatonics<br/>seem to work exactly as Paul explains. There probably are ways to<br/>tonicize any mode of the scale but when the characteristic<br/>dissonance is played Paul&apos;s intended resolutions of it really sound<br/>like the most satisfying ones. That&apos;s really all there is to it.<br/>I don&apos;t understand why you expect &quot;some kind of radical switch&quot;.</p><p>&gt; &gt; &gt; You honestly don&apos;t think that it just had a different musical feeling,<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; the same one that caused them to sharpen it even when they started<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; using harmony?<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; Of course it had a different musical feeling but just having a<br/>&gt; &gt; different musical feeling is not sufficient reason to sharpen<br/>&gt; &gt; consistently. Just having a different musical feeling would imply<br/>&gt; &gt; sometimes sharpening and sometimes not, just for variety&apos;s sake,<br/>&gt; &gt; don&apos;t you think?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Which is exactly what people have since started doing, to add variety.<br/>&gt; I reference you to noted music theorists Earth Wind and Fire, with the<br/>&gt; use of the minor v chord:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_XOY7lsBVpo">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_XOY7lsBVpo</a><br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; And &quot;Louie Louie&quot;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Vae_AkLb4Q">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Vae_AkLb4Q</a><br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; etc. They could have also used Dorian and Phrygian and such, but<br/>&gt; didn&apos;t. Or they could have stuck with Aeolian and used bVII7, as<br/>&gt; Celtic folk music does, all of which to add variety. Why not? That<br/>&gt; wasn&apos;t the feeling that was in style at the time.</p><p>That&apos;s your explanation for the consistent sharpening in cadences in<br/>Musica Ficta? OK, but then you are now basically saying that the<br/>properties of the leading tone had nothing to do with it. You are<br/>saying that in Musica Ficta the practice was just the fashion of the<br/>time while in common practice tonality the leading tone suddenly has<br/>magical properties that make V-i the preferred cadence in minor<br/>tonality.</p><p>&gt; &gt; &gt; OK, I can see that. I guess I just am not convinced of the possibility<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; of using 550 cents as a substitute for 600 cents, that&apos;s all. Although<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; 7/5 &quot;fuses&quot; better than 11/8, there is a sense in which the former is<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; more dissonant, and this is what makes it suitable for resolutions to<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; my ears. I don&apos;t know what that sense is. It could be the fact that<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; 11/8, if played with the root doubled down a few bass notes, becomes<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; something like 2:4:8:11, which is pretty simple, whereas 7/5 becomes<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; 5:10:20:28, which is less. So perhaps tonalness has to do with it.<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; Honestly, no matter how much I listen to Pajara, I can&apos;t get into the<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; sound of 11/8 as a characteristic dissonance, nor can I get into the<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; sound of 8/7 as a leading tone. I&apos;ve been trying for years.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; I&apos;m using TOP Pajara in my example and the characteristic dissonance<br/>&gt; &gt; is 532.833 cents which is more like 11:15 than 8:11. Also the rare<br/>&gt; &gt; interval in Pajara is not the ~7:8. It&apos;s an ~9:10.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Sorry, I meant 10/9 for the rare interval. But I thought this was<br/>&gt; 22-equal - maybe the fact that the dissonance is only 533 cents has<br/>&gt; something to do with it.</p><p>Something to do with what?</p><p>&gt; &gt; &gt; My question is, now that I&apos;ve explained the progression, would you say<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; that the mavila one sounds &quot;modal&quot; and the meantone one sounds<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &quot;tonal?&quot; Or that they both sound modal, or that they both sound tonal?<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; To my ears, they both sound tonal, with this one colorful IV/IV thrown<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; in there.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; They both sound more modal than tonal to me but I hear that IV/IV as<br/>&gt; &gt; sticking out so maybe there is some sense of chords belonging or not<br/>&gt; &gt; belonging to a key.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; OK. Well, I don&apos;t hear it that way. I hear the IV/IV as a temporary<br/>&gt; modulation in the same way that I hear meantone Cm -&gt; Bbmaj -&gt; Abmaj<br/>&gt; -&gt; Gmaj -&gt; Cmaj as containing a modulation when the Bb in the Bbmaj is<br/>&gt; supplanted by the B natural in the Gmaj. It doesn&apos;t destroy the<br/>&gt; perception that C is a tonal center in any event.</p><p>So what?

When you arpeggiate C-E-G, it&apos;s more consonant than if you<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; arpeggiate C-Eb-Gb. When you arpeggiate Bb-C-D-F, it&apos;s more consonant<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; than if you arpeggiate Bb-B-D-F. When you arpeggiate Bb-C-D, it&apos;s more<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; consonant than if you arpeggiate Bb-B-C. And even if we&apos;re talking<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; about just two notes, if you arpeggiate Bb-C, it&apos;s more consonant than<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; if you arpeggiate Bb-B.<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; Yes, if you arpeggiate. That&apos;s what I said.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; You also said that it doesn&apos;t apply to melodic intervals. Arpeggiated<br/>&gt; &gt; dyads are melodic intervals. Are you changing your opinion now?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I said &quot;steps&quot;.</p><p>Melodic steps are arpeggiated intervals. I&apos;m saying that successive<br/>melodic major seconds, like C-D-E, lends itself to an interpretation<br/>where it&apos;s fleshing out C-D-E as a chord, and throwing a minor second<br/>in there doesn&apos;t lend itself to that kind of interpretation.</p><p>&gt; &gt; I hear them as suggesting &quot;new notes&quot; that are separate from the last<br/>&gt; &gt; one. It&apos;s not so much that they are directly dissonant, it&apos;s that they<br/>&gt; &gt; signal your brain into that the note after the leading tone is not a<br/>&gt; &gt; part of the previous arpeggiated chord. C-C#-D doesn&apos;t sound like it&apos;s<br/>&gt; &gt; arpeggiating a chord, C-D-E does. Even dyadically, C-C# doesn&apos;t sound<br/>&gt; &gt; like it&apos;s arpeggiating anything in particular, C-D does.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; I think that the dissonance of the semitone causes us to hear motion<br/>&gt; &gt; by that interval as emphatically NOT being part of an arpeggiated<br/>&gt; &gt; chord,<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; What if you arpeggiate a maj7 chord voiced so that there is a<br/>&gt; semitone?</p><p>I&apos;ll need to explain my experience a little further before I can<br/>answer that.

I can only explain my experience so feel free to tell<br/>me if your experience differs from mine.</p><p>There&apos;s always a &quot;root&quot; that I&apos;m imagining in my head the whole time<br/>while these notes are played. For any sequence of notes that you play,<br/>as long as I can comfortably imagine the same root underneath the<br/>whole thing, I can hear it as an arpeggiation.

Maybe<br/>in 22-equal the whole thing will make more sense.</p><p>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Sorry, I meant 10/9 for the rare interval.

Harmonically, this scale leads<br/>to a lot of great chord progressions, all of which I like and have<br/>started using in my own playing in 12-equal a lot. I&apos;m only talking<br/>about my perception of the scale as it pertains to melody.</p><p>1) At first, I heard standard pentachordal major as being completely<br/>atonal and chromatic. It sounded like every note in 12-equal except<br/>for Eb and Ab, which made it sound about as atonal as the 12-equal<br/>chromatic scale where I just avoid playing two of the notes for some<br/>reason. The 22-equal version sounded more or less like the same thing<br/>with better intonation and didn&apos;t &quot;snap&quot; my brain into any radically<br/>new perception of it. This was early on.</p><p>2) I quickly discover that this scale leads to ridiculously awesome<br/>chord progressions. This changes my perception of the scale, which I<br/>now start hearing as a generally tonal scale with some &quot;passing notes&quot;<br/>in it. The C# and F# in C pentachordal major sounded like passing<br/>notes that weren&apos;t particularly related to anything, and the B as<br/>well. If I take all of the passing notes out of it, I end up with<br/>mixolydian. I now decide that Pajara in 22-equal is the least<br/>xenharmonic scale of all time. This is where I was at up until about a<br/>few weeks ago.</p><p>3) This discussion we&apos;re having inspires me to start exploring<br/>12-equal as a 2.3.5.7.17.19 subgroup temperament. I discover that if I<br/>play full harmonic series-ish chords and then cluster chords on top<br/>like C-C#-D-D#-E, the cluster chord takes on an &quot;otonal&quot; and &quot;rooted&quot;<br/>quality and sounds like 16:17:18:19:20. I discover that C-C#-D-E can<br/>snap into the same perception. I &quot;train&quot; myself to &quot;look&quot; for this<br/>perception, which gets easier with time. Now I start hearing the &quot;C#&quot;<br/>in the C-C#-D-E beginning of pentachordal major as being weakly<br/>related to the fundamental via this perception, kind of like how I<br/>think common practice folks heard the &quot;D&quot; in C-D-E.</p><p>I have finally conquered the previous &quot;confusion.&quot; I haven&apos;t played it<br/>in 22-equal since this very dramatic perceptual shift and so I can&apos;t<br/>comment on whether I hear 16/11 as a characteristic &quot;dissonance&quot; with<br/>this perception. In fact, the entire scale now sort of sounds like one<br/>huge arpeggiated otonal chord to me. This is sort of cool and<br/>exploring this perception leads to some new possibilities in 12-equal,<br/>like playing C# over C major, and then playing it again over A minor.<br/>It doesn&apos;t sound as chaotic and noisy this way, but still requires<br/>more effort to keep that C-C# in the right &quot;frame.&quot;</p><p>4) I still don&apos;t hear the large steps in the scale as &quot;signaling&quot;<br/>anything. And, all things considered, I don&apos;t like this scale as much<br/>for melody as something like Semaphore[9], which is awesome, or<br/>Mavila[9], which is fantastic, or Keemun[7] which I love, or<br/>Father[8], etc. Especially Keemun[7], which just seemed to &quot;snap into<br/>place&quot; immediately for me without much training at all. Pajara[10] and<br/>the pentachordal MODMOS&apos;s on the other hand don&apos;t really sound as<br/>immediately good. I have to work a bit harder and force my brain into<br/>this new 17-limit &quot;sound&quot; to get it to really make sense.</p><p>As a final example, something like Augmented[9] sounds to my brain<br/>like Pajara does - confusing, requires me to think more, etc. But<br/>Triforce[9] just &quot;works&quot; instantly. So there&apos;s more to it just than<br/>that all new microtonal scales require lengthy training periods.</p><p>The record has now been set straight.</p><p>&gt; Also, the 17-limit interpretations of the decatonic intervals are<br/>&gt; explicitly mentioned in Paul&apos;s 22-tone paper.</p><p>Thanks for mentioning, I didn&apos;t remember that. But even so, my<br/>approach to get past the initial confusion of this scale was to force<br/>myself to get used to the 17-limit, which is a somewhat fragile<br/>perception. How will I hear 16/11 and 11/8 as &quot;characteristically<br/>dissonant&quot; if I&apos;m forcing myself to swallow a 17-limit pill?</p><p>&gt; &gt; Let me ask you a question, Kalle - in your view, what works better for<br/>&gt; &gt; melody: standard pentachordal major or Father[8]? If you think that<br/>&gt; &gt; they&apos;re both &quot;potentially equal&quot; with enough training, which one do<br/>&gt; &gt; you think would be more immediately comprehensible?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Probably Father, at least at first because monophonically played it<br/>&gt; gives an impression of having diatonic sounding snippets. So?</p><p>How about 2 1 2 1 2 1 2 in 11-equal vs Pajara?</p><p>I think that the &quot;diatonic sounding snippets&quot; that you are referring<br/>to are more than just &quot;parts of a familiar whole.&quot; These &quot;snippets&quot;<br/>are made up of features that the diatonic scale and the father[8] MOS<br/>both happen to have. The LLs tetrachord that&apos;s present in both scales<br/>isn&apos;t just a diatonic snippet, but a series of two consonant sounding<br/>&quot;whole tones&quot; that make a &quot;5/4&quot; and then have a &quot;leading tone&quot; at the<br/>end.</p><p>My brain hears that as &quot;join join break!&quot; And the periodic breaks<br/>fracture the scale into different stable points of melodic repose, and<br/>make it more efficient for melody to imply something like a root shift<br/>or a chord progression. Of course, you&apos;re saying you don&apos;t hear C-D-E<br/>that way, so I&apos;m not sure what to make of that, but that sure is how<br/>it works for me.</p><p>-Mike</p></div>
