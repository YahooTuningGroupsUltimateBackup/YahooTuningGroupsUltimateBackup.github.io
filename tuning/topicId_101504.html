These are arranged like the verticies of a cube, so that moving between these chords can be done expeditiously and in a variety of ways. It turns out it is its own convex closure in starling temperament. Starling (126/125) tempering increases the number of major and minor triads from four of each to five of each, so that there is an extra triad of each kind not extending to a tetrad. It also increases the subminor and supermajor tetrads from one each to two each. It&apos;s 21115251112333 in 31edo and 12 7 5 7 29 12 29 7 5 7 12 17 19 17 in 185edo.</p><p><a href="http://xenharmonic.wikispaces.com/Gallery+of+Z-polygon+transversals">http://xenharmonic.wikispaces.com/Gallery+of+Z-polygon+transversals</a></p></div>
