I do want to say a word or two about<br/>composition, as I&apos;ve really been heading into new territory the last few<br/>months (on fretless and 31 eq), and creating some quite new (for me)<br/>music. First, the fretless piece...I tuned the guitar to various<br/>harmonics, so the usual, guitaristic patterns that I usually deal with,<br/>were not there anymore...in fact, intellectually, it took me a while to<br/>even understand the tuning...I just liked the SOUND of it (now I KNOW<br/>what it is). But, at first, I was going entirely by ear...which I have<br/>done most of my life.<br/>    Then, a small pattern, made of 3 harmonics, somehow appeared as I<br/>was putzing around, then a little 2 note shape, but that was about it<br/>for almost a year. Then, in the fall of 2000, all of a sudden one day,<br/>as I sat down to putz some more, a virtual flood of ideas, melodies, and<br/>patterns showed up, one after the other, for several days in a row...I<br/>mean, riff after riff, variation after variation...I was able to get a<br/>10 minute piece together for Microstock 6, and the ideas were still<br/>pouring out...I had to edit them down to get the piece together. In<br/>fact, to this day, everytime I work on this piece, ideas are STILL<br/>flooding through this body.<br/>    The point, for me, is this...&quot;I&quot; did not &quot;think&quot; of 99% of these<br/>melodies/riffs; I found my hands literally playing them, somehow, while<br/>&quot;I&quot; watched...THEN, later, I would go back and intellectually figure out<br/>the names of the notes, etc...in fact, I still do not know the scales I<br/>am playing in this piece...and, I really don&apos;t care. But, it is<br/>cohesive, has a good shape, and I consider it one of my better<br/>compositions. (Oh yeah, it also evokes really deep/profound feelings and<br/>images for me as well...that&apos;s how I ultimately judge my work...).<br/>    As far as I am concerned, I did not write this piece...somehow,<br/>ideas came to me from somewhere, and my hands &quot;did&quot; it...so, where was<br/>I, where is this place, and what does it have to do with<br/>theory/intellect? After 35 years of playing, I&apos;m not exactly sure, nor<br/>do I really care...al I know is, creativity, for me, seems to reside<br/>somewhere in the Universe, and once I &quot;get&quot; to that place, I&apos;ve hit the<br/>big number, and &quot;I&quot;, as a composer, can create a new piece.<br/>    Same thing happened last week with 31...I was sitting, putzing<br/>around, when my hands started playing a riff...I said, &quot;that&apos;s it!,&quot; and<br/>THEN stopped to count out the rhythms, and &quot;learn&quot; what I was already<br/>doing. Again, I did not think of this riff beforehand...somehow, it<br/>appeared while I was playing. Now, I CAN use my intellectually learned<br/>concepts of variation, etc., to expand on it...but, the initial idea had<br/>nothing to do with that part of me which I think of as my intellect.<br/>And, knowing me, I won&apos;t be using the intellectual side much to expand<br/>on it, either.<br/>    In fact, when I look back at all of the tunes I&apos;ve written (which is<br/>a lot), I cannot remember EVER using the  intellectual part of myself to<br/>compose them...it seems like all of a sudden, there&apos;s a piece, and I<br/>cannot remember how it got there. Yet, I&apos;ve studied and practiced a lot<br/>over the years, so I know that process certainly aids in the final<br/>result. Yet, I don&apos;t seem to use it in the actual process of composing;<br/>at least, not consciously.<br/>   And, this is not a new story, for sure...many artists have remarked<br/>that, at their best, the music seems to be coming through them, from<br/>somewhere else, and that &quot;thinking&quot; stops it. Joe Pass often talked<br/>about that, as well as many others, and I agree, for my part.<br/>    Composition is a rather mystical event, for me, and I am certainly<br/>curious as to how others compose, as well. Many people have remarked how<br/>all ideas already exist, and we, as artists, just go get them, somehow,<br/>from somewhere. Maybe so...these things are not only hard to prove,<br/>they&apos;re impossible to prove...and, that&apos;s why I like being an artist so<br/>much. I enjoy the realms of the unknowable, and feel most comfortable<br/>there...Hstick</p></div><h3><a id=20084 href="#20084">ðŸ”—</a>JSZANTO@ADNC.COM</h3><span>3/11/2001 12:30:07 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Neil,</p><p>I think your message got posted twice, but what the heck, I had a<br/>question anyway:</p><p>Looking at your post (and knowing a bit about your music), it seems<br/>like virtually everything you&apos;ve done, in terms of &quot;composition&quot;, has<br/>come from literally having a guitar (of some sort!) in your hands.

Even a SINGLE NOTE<br/>&gt; sounds superb!  A big blast.  It means nothing.&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Unless it means something, I guess...<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &lt;&lt;Only a person who can REALLY write for INDIVIDUAL instruments<br/>knows his &quot;stuff...&quot;&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Joe, you must be high -- in fact, I think I&apos;m going to have to<br/>&gt; repossess your lava lamp!<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Come on man, who&apos;s going to tell me they&apos;ve got the definitive<br/>skinny on who can &quot;really&quot; write... and what &quot;stuff&quot; would they<br/>really know even if they do?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Look, a competent artisan is a competent artisan, and a awkward<br/>&gt; dilettante is an awkward dilettante. But an inspired one from any<br/>side of the fence is a whole other ball o&apos; wax in my opinion!<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Is it fair or even sensible to call Hindemith and Johnny Cash both<br/>&gt; &quot;composers&quot;? I think it has to be for the term to have any real<br/>&gt; meaning or importance.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; --Dan Stearns</p><p>Hi Dan...</p><p>You and I obviously have different definitions of &quot;composer&quot; and<br/>&quot;music,&quot; so we&apos;ll leave it at that, I guess...</p><p>I&apos;ve enjoyed very much listening to what you do, so, my personal<br/>definitions don&apos;t really affect my &quot;enjoyment&quot; of it, per se.</p><p>HOWEVER, my comments about composition are mostly involved with<br/>traditional instruments and traditional training and writing and such<br/>like.</p><p>I believe there are SOME people on this list who are interested in<br/>this.

A more &quot;traditional&quot; work I<br/>cannot imagine... As you know, it&apos;s still performed frequently in<br/>it&apos;s<br/>&quot;original&quot; state, and also as part of the 1st String Quartet.</p><p>Regarding the &quot;technical&quot; discussion, I was only comparing the idea<br/>of writing traditional works in an orchestral form as contrasted with<br/>writing for individual instruments.

I have no problem with that.<br/>I believe these two particular individuals, however, also wrote some<br/>traditional instrumental music, for what it&apos;s worth.</p><p>No, if it was implied that I thought that one had to write for<br/>traditional instruments in order to be a &quot;composer&quot; then I have<br/>misstated my intention.  My point was only that for the composers who<br/>CHOOSE to write for traditional instruments, the best way is to write<br/>lots of good SOLO pieces and to try to PLAY the instruments as well,<br/>if at all possible.  It&apos;s much harder to write a good piece for a<br/>solo<br/>instrument than to spash gobs of paint on an orchestral canvas.  And,<br/>in my opinion, practically ANYTHING sounds good with an orchestra...<br/>even a SINGLE note!</p><p>I would certainly call a &quot;composer&quot; a person who assembles sound<br/>collages like YOU do... with or without formal training.  But why,<br/>exactly do you even WANT to be called a &quot;composer??&quot;  Many fine<br/>composers have not.  Edgar Varese hated the term, if you will recall.<br/> He prefered that he be called an &quot;arranger of sounds&quot; or &quot;sound<br/>engineer.&quot;  He believed that the term &quot;composer&quot; had too many stuffy,<br/>dated and historically-related implications that he would rather<br/>avoid.</p><p>So now why do YOU want to be called a &quot;composer&quot; again??</p><p>__________ ______ _____<br/>Joseph Pehrson</p></div><h3><a id=20438 href="#20438">ðŸ”—</a>D.Stearns &#x3C;STEARNS@CAPECOD.NET&#x3E;</h3><span>3/26/2001 4:48:46 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Joseph Pehrson wrote,</p><p>&lt;&lt;But why, exactly do you even WANT to be called a &quot;composer??&quot;  Many<br/>fine composers have not.&gt;&gt;</p><p>Hi Joe,</p><p>I&apos;m not so sure that I do, but if I do it&apos;s a convenience thing...<br/>composer, guitarist, microtonalist.
