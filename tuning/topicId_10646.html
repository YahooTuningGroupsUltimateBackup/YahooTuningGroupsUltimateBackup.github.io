It is certainly not a<br/>subset of the stellated 2(4 CPS. If it happens to be a subset of a<br/>CPS with 2, 4, or 6 more factors, that really wouldn&apos;t be very<br/>helpful to a composer who&apos;s working only within the 7-limit, now<br/>would it?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Wilson&apos;s actual presentation of stellation deserves to be<br/>&gt;summarized, for his approach is surprising.

If this<br/>is wrong, then are there 25 possible stellations resulting from 5<br/>ways to construct the union and 5 ways to stellate each one; or do<br/>some of these come out being identical?</p><p>&gt;From the text and my notes to Wilson&apos;s presentation to me 20-some<br/>&gt;years ago, I have the impression that he arrived at this solution by<br/>&gt;constructing a styrofoam-ball-and-dowell model.</p><p>These would undoubtedly help greatly in grasping (literally and<br/>figuratively) these structures. It&apos;s too bad e-mail doesn&apos;t allow you<br/>to portray these things very well.</p></div>
