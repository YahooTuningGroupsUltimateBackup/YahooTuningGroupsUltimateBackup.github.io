But in case of GNU and other<br/>software it has an entirely different meaning, namely that you are<br/>free do to almost anything with the software code, including changing<br/>it or ask money for it. With Scala it&apos;s certainly not allowed to<br/>ask money for it for one thing.</p><p>See <a href="http://www.gnu.org/philosophy/words-to-avoid.html">http://www.gnu.org/philosophy/words-to-avoid.html</a> for more<br/>explanation.</p><p>Manuel</p></div>
