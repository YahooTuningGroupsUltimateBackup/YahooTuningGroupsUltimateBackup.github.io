If you read my recent post<br/>on CPSs, I touch on the difference between JI tunings (whose pitches are<br/>written as fractions) and JI harmony (where all the intervals in a sonority<br/>appear in a list of consonances).  The terms &quot;just intonation&quot; and &quot;limit&quot;<br/>have been confusingly applied to both these things.</p><p>For purposes of discussing consonant intervals, many listers have decided<br/>to write the ratios involved with colons (:), distinguishing _intervals_<br/>from _pitches in a tuning_ (which they write with slashes (/), following<br/>Ellis, Partch, the American Gamelan folks, et all).  So the JI diatonic<br/>scale may be written...</p><p>1/1  9/8  5/4  4/3  3/2  5/3  15/8<br/> C    D    E    F    G    A     B</p><p>...and the interval between D and E may be written as 10:9.</p><p>For tunings, the &quot;limit&quot; used is often a &quot;prime limit&quot;, when the<br/>diatonic scale above is considered 5-limit, since 5 is the largest<br/>prime factor needed to write all the fractions involved.</p><p>For harmony, the &quot;limit&quot; used is often &quot;odd&quot;, since consonance seems<br/>to change, roughly, with the largest odd factor appearing in any<br/>interval in the chord sounding.  There are good psychoacoustic and<br/>practical reasons for thinking in terms of an odd-limit for harmony;<br/>Partch did so.  In we play all the notes in the above scale at once,<br/>the odd limit would be 45, since there&apos;s a 45:32 between F and B.</p><p>Prime limit may have come into use for tunings because many tunings<br/>are designed to provide several copies of simple chords (like the<br/>diatonic scale contains triads), and often if you use a prime limit,<br/>the factorization will reveal the harmonic limit of the simple chords<br/>which have been transposed throughout the scale (the triads in the<br/>diatonic scale are 5-odd-limit).</p><p>More examples:</p><p>1/1 and 15/8<br/>prime= 5<br/>odd= 15</p><p>1/1 and 5/4 and 15/8<br/>prime= 5<br/>odd= 15</p><p>1/1 and 8/5 and 16/15<br/>prime= 5<br/>odd= 15</p><p>1/1 and 11/8 and 15/8<br/>prime= 11<br/>odd= 15</p><p>As you can see from these examples, either &quot;limit&quot; can be somewhat<br/>limiting for harmony, since a &quot;limit&quot; assumes you&apos;ll be using every<br/>factor up to the limit before you increase the limit.  But you may<br/>not always want to do this, and when you don&apos;t, it&apos;s best to list the<br/>factors you consider consonant.  In the last example, they would be<br/>(1, 11, 15) -- 15-limit and 11-limit are both deceptive here because<br/>7, 5, and 3 are missing.</p><p>&gt;so, if limit isn&apos;t the right word to refer to these &quot;dimensions&quot;, what<br/>&gt;is?  is there a term for the infinite 1-dimensional lattice made with<br/>&gt;powers of 3?  the 2-dimensional lattice with powers of 3 and 5?  etc etc...</p><p>On a lattice, each dimension is usually mapped to a single factor.  If<br/>you include a dimension for every prime factor up to x, then I&apos;d call it<br/>a x-prime-limit lattice.  Same goes for odd-limit lattices, but they do<br/>have a quirk where composite odd numbers will appear in more than once<br/>place -- 9 will be one step on the 9-axis, or two steps on the 3 axis, for<br/>example.  Normally, this doesn&apos;t cause a problem, since our ordinary 3-D<br/>space can only accomidate the 7-limit (which is the same wether odd or<br/>prime, since the first composite odd number is 9).  But on some of Erv<br/>Wilson&apos;s diagrams, you can see pitches appearing in multiple places.</p><p>-Carl</p></div>
