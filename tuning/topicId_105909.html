You&apos;re using a 7-limit extension of<br/>Blackwood called &quot;Blacksmith&quot; temperament, which tempers out 28/27 as<br/>well as 256/243. Since both of those commas vanish, all products and<br/>quotients of the commas vanish as well, such as (28/27) / (256/243) =<br/>64/63, and (28/27) / (64/63) = 49/48, and (64/63) / (49/48) =<br/>1029/1024, and (49/48) * (1029/1024) = 16807/16384.</p><p>So you&apos;re actually pumping through the whole set of commas at once, in<br/>your case. When you have a temperament where more than one comma<br/>vanishes (a so-called &quot;codimension &gt; 1 temperament&quot;), sometimes you<br/>end up in situations where you can interpret the choice of comma pump<br/>in more than one ways, or treat it as though it tempers an entire set<br/>of commas out at once. For instance, you&apos;re also moving by three 8/7&apos;s<br/>to get to a 3/2, meaning that 1029/1024 vanishes as well.</p><p>Thanks and welcome to the forum!</p><p>-Mike</p></div><h3><a id=105943 href="#105943">ðŸ”—</a>James Fenn &#x3C;james@...&#x3E;</h3><span>3/2/2013 6:12:56 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Why is there a distinction between Blacksmith and Blackwood? As I think I<br/>understand, any tuning in Blackwood has 2 cycles of 5edo separated by a<br/>major-3rd-like interval and in Blacksmith, the 7/4 interval is the interval<br/>implied by 4 steps of 5edo which any tuning of Blackwood would also<br/>contain. Does it mean that if you don&apos;t use that interval in your piece of<br/>music then it isn&apos;t in Blacksmith temperament?</p><p>Is there a name for an 11-limit extension of Blackwood? I made another<br/>comma-pump, this time it goes around a cycle of 720 cent 5ths and uses<br/>inversions of 4:7:11 chords, tempered to 55edo. If there isn&apos;t a name, I&apos;d<br/>enjoy the poetic injustice of it being called Blackbird:<br/><a href="https://soundcloud.com/james-fenn-theoretical/comma-pump-4-7-11-inversions">https://soundcloud.com/james-fenn-theoretical/comma-pump-4-7-11-inversions</a></p><p>On 22 February 2013 21:52, Mike Battaglia &lt;<a href="mailto:battaglia01@gmail.com">battaglia01@gmail.com</a>&gt; wrote:</p><p>&gt; **<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Hello James,<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; On Thu, Feb 21, 2013 at 8:49 AM, James Fenn james@...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; Hi All,<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; Since this is my first post, I&apos;d like to start with a big thank-you to<br/>&gt; all<br/>&gt; &gt; the amazing people who have posted here over the years.
