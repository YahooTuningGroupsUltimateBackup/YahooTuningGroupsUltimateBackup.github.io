I hasten to add that the criticism of the<br/>website was a criticism of *Partch* and *not* Chris Foster, a subtle<br/>distinction that the plaintiff seems to have missed.</p><p>This apparently so infuriated Chris that he insisted that Paul<br/>withdraw the post #52006 from these archives.</p><p>Chris insists that Paul never removed the post.  However, Paul *did*<br/>as anyone examining these archives can prove.</p><p>Personally, I feel the removal was unwarranted and the charges<br/>exaggerated, especially since there was no further discussion or<br/>clarification of the issues, issues that could be of value to us in<br/>the &quot;alternate tuning community...&quot;</p><p>Chris&apos;s unstated assumption, as *I* read it, is that Partch is such a<br/>great composer and great man that *nothing,* even Partch&apos;s<br/>interpretations of history, which was the actual item under<br/>discussion, should be questioned.  I feel this is censorship.</p><p>As one of your friendly moderators, I would suggest, instead of<br/>histrionics resulting from criticism (which included the<br/>description &quot;beautiful,&quot; hardly an approbation) we engage in a<br/>substantive discussion of particular factual issues.  I also would<br/>suggest that persons, such as the plaintiff actually *read* the<br/>posts, rather than reacting, since Paul Erlich also said that<br/>Partch&apos;s work was an &quot;inspiration.&quot;</p><p>We all would stand to learn more that way...</p><p>Joseph Pehrson</p></div><h3>Joseph Pehrson &#x3C;jpehrson@rcn.com&#x3E;</h3><span>1/31/2004 11:08:52 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;Joseph Pehrson&quot; &lt;jpehrson@r...&gt; wrote:</p><p><a href="http://groups.yahoo.com/group/tuning/message/52257">http://groups.yahoo.com/group/tuning/message/52257</a></p><p>&gt; As one of the moderators of this group, I received an offline<br/>message</p><p>***I&apos;ve taken the suggestion of one of our offlist informants that<br/>this Cris Foster situation should be best kept offlist.</p><p>So, I will no longer be responding to this issue here and I will take<br/>my modest authority as moderator to suggest that anyone continuing<br/>this thread here will be summarily executed...</p><p>J.
