Given the task of cutting 9 tortes into<br/>2,3,4,5,6,7,8, and 9 slices, rank the difficulty of the slices. Most would<br/>probably agree that two comes first, and then four, but Claehrence Bharlo<br/>reported that disagreement appeared already with the third item.</p><p>Although I cannot invite the list to dinner in Cologne, I propose that we<br/>duplicate the experiment. Since most of us on the list are into higher<br/>primes, let&apos;s try all divisions through 19.  Please send me, off list ,<br/>your own ranking of the difficulties in slicing tortes (cakes, pies) from 2<br/>to 19 equal parts.  I&apos;ll compile the results and report back.</p></div><h3><a id=1338 href="#1338">ðŸ”—</a>Kraig Grady &#x3C;kraiggrady@xxxxxxxxx.xxxx&#x3E;</h3><span>3/6/1999 9:46:38 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Concerning Barlow Indigestibility:<br/>    It seems like it was just a few months when we went over the Barlow<br/>stuff. I expressed at that time that in examining the 24 inversions of<br/>11 limit tetrads where no two voices were separated by more than an<br/>octave that barlows results did not coincide with my ear. I believe<br/>Erlich had some problems with the results of his formula. In a true<br/>science when an experiment fails they throw it in the trash or modify<br/>it.<br/>-- Kraig Grady<br/>North American Embassy of Anaphoria Island<br/><a href="http://www.anaphoria.com">www.anaphoria.com</a></p></div><h3><a id=1387 href="#1387">ðŸ”—</a>Daniel Wolf &#x3C;DJWOLF_MATERIAL@xxxxxxxxxx.xxxx&#x3E;</h3><span>3/8/1999 4:28:44 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Message text written by <a href="mailto:INTERNET:tuning@onelist.com">INTERNET:tuning@onelist.com</a><br/>&gt;I believe<br/>Erlich had some problems with the results of his formula.
