I started playing in the belly dance scene here in Denver in the 1970&apos;s, and have not only listened to a great deal of Arabic/Eastern music, but have been around the folks of that culture quite a bit as well. I was playing in an Iranian restaurant when the hostages were taken in Tehran in 1979 (and they treated me very well). While I have not analyzed the intervals in the way folks are now doing here, I understand very well the basic concepts behind what constitutes a maqam. And I am reasonably sure that if I choose to study this form further, Rahim would help me in any way he could. So, I feel I&apos;m on pretty solid ground when I speak of this style. I do agree, however, that analyzing music of other, non Western, cultures in the way folks are doing here doesn&apos;t make any sense...cause the Arabs did not arrive at their pitches in any way connected with this sort of dry, intellectual analysis...nor did most other cultures that I am aware of. The tunings are intimately connected to each maqam form, and cannot be separated from the intent of the maqam. As Rahim has said, the purpose of Iraqi music is to &quot;settle the soul...only then are you inside the maqam.&quot; That might be the best place to start approaching this profound and ancient art form...best...Stickman  <a href="http://www.microstick.net">www.microstick.net</a></p></div>
