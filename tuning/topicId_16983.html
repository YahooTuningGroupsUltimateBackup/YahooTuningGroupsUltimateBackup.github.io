I don&apos;t know what that means,<br/>&gt;&gt; but I&apos;ve seen huge audiences transfixed during<br/>&gt;&gt; long non-danceable, lyricless segments of many<br/>&gt;&gt; bands such as Phish. Being in a danceable band<br/>&gt;&gt; myself, I know that our non-danceable numbers are<br/>&gt;&gt; enjoyed with as much appreciation as the danceable<br/>&gt;&gt; ones -- people appreciate the chance to rest their<br/>&gt;&gt; bodies and use their heads instead.</p><p>Monz wrote,</p><p>&gt;Whoa!! Hold on there, Justin!  In agreement with<br/>&gt;Paul, I must add that my favorite composer (most folks<br/>&gt;here already know this...) is Mahler, and if anyone&apos;s<br/>&gt;music is abstract, it&apos;s *his*!</p><p>Mahler is abstract and he is falls under that big umbrella most people<br/>inaccuratlely call classical. Even the classical big guns Bach, Beethoven &amp;<br/>Mozart don&apos;t sell a fraction of the records that Britney Spears does.</p><p>How many serious living composers are actually making a decent living out<br/>side of Academia. There are a few perhaps but could you call them popular ?<br/>Perhaps I should define what I mean by popular-&quot;having record sales equal<br/>to or above any top 40 chart dweller.&quot;</p><p>&gt;And I&apos;m far from alone in my admiration: Mahler is<br/>&gt;today one of the most popular composers ever.  If<br/>&gt;you&apos;d like to see evidence that some people are far<br/>&gt;more fanatical about him than even I am, take a<br/>&gt;look at this:</p><p>The reason I brought all this up was in relation to what Neil Haverstick<br/>was saying about why us microtonalists are not being played on radio etc.</p><p>I can see a valid point there though perhaps we shouldn&apos;t be trying to get<br/>our music onto pop radio staions or MTV but should instead pursue community<br/>radio or classical stations.<br/>However it is likely that Mahler would probably get the nod over you and<br/>myself because he isn&apos;t into &quot;weird&quot; tunings like us.</p><p>&gt;You have to be really careful about making sweeping blanket<br/>&gt;statements about what makes music popular.</p><p>Generalisations make communication relatively brief.Imagine how long my<br/>post would have been had I qualified everything I said ! But I take your<br/>point.</p><p>&gt; In this day and age,<br/>&gt;people have access to everything that&apos;s ever been written, and<br/>&gt;tastes vary accordingly.  I personally really dig music that<br/>&gt;&quot;sounds out of tune&quot;, and I bet Dan Stearns does too!</p><p>I like music that &quot;sounds out of tune&quot; too !

Actually, I do agree with<br/>you that &quot;general&quot; listeners don&apos;t know a piece&apos;s tuning from<br/>a hole in the ground, and probably care even less.  And I<br/>definitely agree that microtonal music is already all around<br/>us - all we have to do is wake up our ears and listen.

I think if you look<br/>beneath the surface of nearly any popular hit recording artist, you will<br/>find both *real* musical talent and a will and drive to succeed. It *is* a<br/>competitive business. Even in the relatively free world of folk music, it<br/>took Peter, Paul and Mary to make a star out of Bob Dylan&apos;s songwriting<br/>talent. He could not have done it on his own performing skills at the time.</p><p>&gt; John Rockwell quoted (in _All-American Music_) the saying that<br/>&gt; &quot;If radio stations would simply play Webern as often as they<br/>&gt; play Christopher Cross, he would sell as many records&quot;, and<br/>&gt; I believe there&apos;s an element of truth in that.</p><p>The fact is that Webern is not played very much at all, much less than<br/>Shostakovich, for example, and almost inconsequential among 20th century<br/>composers relative to Copland, Prokofiev and Stravinsky. In fact, I hear<br/>more music by living composers than I do from Webern. Classical music is a<br/>competitive business too :-). I don&apos;t know what Christopher Cross has done<br/>lately, but I&apos;d guess he isn&apos;t doing very well relative to Britney Spears<br/>and Ricky Martin. If I want to listen to Webern, I pretty much have to get a<br/>CD; my classical station isn&apos;t going to play it.</p><p>&gt; &gt; I can see a valid point there though perhaps we shouldn&apos;t<br/>&gt; &gt; be trying to get our music onto pop radio staions or MTV but<br/>&gt; &gt; should instead pursue community radio or classical stations.<br/>&gt; &gt; However it is likely that Mahler would probably get the nod<br/>&gt; &gt; over you and myself because he isn&apos;t into &quot;weird&quot; tunings<br/>&gt; &gt; like us.</p><p>I have *never* heard a microtonal piece on my local classical station. I<br/>have never heard an electronic piece, with the exception of the Turangalila<br/>symphony of Messiaen, which features a prominent solo part for the ondes<br/>martinot. Even so, it was not a recording but two separate orchestra concert<br/>broadcasts in the past two months.</p><p>They *do* play a lot more 20th century music than most classical stations,<br/>though. Right now, they&apos;re going through the top 100 works as chosen by the<br/>listeners, and they&apos;re up to about 13, which turns out to be Symphony #5 by<br/>Shostakovich. I don&apos;t know what the next ones are going to be, but I&apos;m<br/>pretty sure that among them will be the Schubert Trout Quintet, Beethoven&apos;s<br/>Ninth, Vivaldi&apos;s Four Seasons, and Appalachian Spring.
