Not being a music theorist, let alone a musician,<br/>I find it intriguing to &apos;decode&apos; a performer&apos;s tuning patterns which,<br/>in the case of Turkish music, are constantly changing in a<br/>non-deterministic pattern. The dynamics of such intonations are fascinating<br/>to watch and, hopefully, decipher in a mathematical form. It is like<br/>solving a very sophisticated puzzle, as you have put it so elegantly.</p><p>I believe in my own pedestrian way the genesis of tuning lies in the<br/>collection of all intonations used by all performers on the planet<br/>since the beginning of time, irregardless of what the composers might<br/>have intended. &apos;Taksim&apos; or improvisation is probably the most suitable<br/>musical setting for such intonations to come out in full bloom, without<br/>constraints. Determining the actual tunings in improvisations made on<br/>unrestricted (non-keyboard, non-fretted, etc) instruments is like stepping<br/>into a musical &apos;wonderland&apos; where the human spirit is totally free to<br/>display its infinite dimensional &apos;universe&apos; in the form of sound<br/>progressions. As was mentioned in a previous post, &apos;only God knows what<br/>intonations Art Tatum would have used in his intricate improvisations if<br/>he was playing a non-keyboard instrument&apos;.</p><p>Best regards,</p><p>Dr. Can Akkoc<br/>Alabama School of Mathematics and Science<br/>1255 Dauphin Street<br/>Mobile, AL 36604<br/>USA</p><p>Phone:  (334) 441-2126<br/>  Fax:  (334) 441-3290<br/>  Web:  <a href="http://199.20.31.100/GIFT/">http://199.20.31.100/GIFT/</a></p></div><h3><a id=6671 href="#6671">ðŸ”—</a>D.Stearns &#x3C;stearns@xxxxxxx.xxxx&#x3E;</h3><span>12/6/1999 7:54:35 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>[Can Akkoc:]<br/>&gt;As was mentioned in a previous post, &apos;only God knows what intonations<br/>Art Tatum would have used in his intricate improvisations if he was<br/>playing a non-keyboard instrument&apos;.</p><p>Yes indeed... I think Tatum is an example someone who possessed<br/>uncanny &quot;naturally&quot; ability, and really dug deeply into the<br/>possibilities of the intonation he had at hand - twelve-tone equal<br/>temperament. Some of his modulations and simultaneous manipulations of<br/>melody and harmony (horizontal and vertical planes) are just so<br/>peculiar: I mean way way OUT-THERE! When someone asks me something<br/>along the lines of what I think is a good example of the pinnacle of<br/>what twelve-tone equal temperament can enable or accomplish, I often<br/>want to use Tatum as *the* example. But unfortunately he was also<br/>hardly a &quot;gentle&quot; or a &quot;restful&quot; player... and these are just the<br/>sorts of things that those who have little good to say about equal<br/>temperament will often point to... so I don&apos;t... But boy oh boy, he<br/>sure was a one of a kind... just the tone he got out the piano, I&apos;ve<br/>never really heard anyone else with a combination of tone and touch<br/>quite like it, just amazing.</p><p>And as this thread is titled &quot;old wine in new bottles,&quot; I probably<br/>shouldn&apos;t fail to point out that Tatum&apos;s modus operandi often<br/>consisted of transforming Tin Pan Alley throwaways (which were pretty<br/>banal even then!) into a music teeming with inspirations for the<br/>future...</p><p>Dan</p></div><h3><a id=6674 href="#6674">ðŸ”—</a>D.Stearns &#x3C;stearns@xxxxxxx.xxxx&#x3E;</h3><span>12/6/1999 9:07:02 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>I (troublingly!) wrote:</p><p>&gt;I think Tatum is an example someone who possessed uncanny &quot;naturally&quot;<br/>ability,</p><p>It should have read:</p><p>I think Tatum is an example of someone who possessed<br/>uncanny &quot;natural&quot; ability,</p></div>
