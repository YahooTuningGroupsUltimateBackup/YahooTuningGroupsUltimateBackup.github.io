G# is usually considered<br/>to be 25/16 relative to C in JI anyway.</p><p>&gt;(ii) play E major with 1 5/4 3/2 ratios, but shift E down slightly so that<br/>&gt;none of E Ab or B are played as 5/4, 8/5 and 15/8 of C respectively, but a<br/>&gt;centered shift is done (like John A. deLaubenfels example in following<br/>&gt;replies to my question - that&apos;s how I know what it&apos;s called :)).</p><p>That may be necessary if you&apos;re going to continue modulating in major thirds<br/>(like Schubert) and want to get back to C. But then you&apos;d shift E up<br/>slightly, not down slightly. I can&apos;t think of a case where you&apos;d want to<br/>shift it down slightly.</p><p>&gt;(iii)  Play E major using the 5/4, 8/5 and 15/8 of C (the original<br/>pitches),<br/>&gt;so the major third is no longer 5/4 but is 32/25 = 1.28</p><p>That&apos;s Ken Overton&apos;s way, and it sucks. I&apos;d never do that. Again, you&apos;re<br/>using Ab instead of G#.</p><p>&gt;Continue the progression given above (Cmaj - Emaj) to Abmin, so Ab and B<br/>are<br/>&gt;held.  If Abmin is to have ratios of 1 6/5 3/2, one has to play B at 48/25<br/>&gt;=1.92 of C instead of the original 15/8, or shift both Ab and B (maybe<br/>using<br/>&gt;again John&apos;s centered shift).</p><p>Again, depends on context. There&apos;s no reason to shift G# and B from the E<br/>major, since they already form the same interval they should in G#min,<br/>unless you&apos;re going to try to get back to C by going up a major third.</p><p>&gt;&gt;That doesn&apos;t work so well for certain chords. For example, a C6/9 chord<br/>&gt;&gt;(C E G A D) would have the fifth between A and D as 40:27 if you tuned it<br/>&gt;&gt;according to &quot;the JI major scale&quot; on C</p><p>&gt;Do you mean the 4th of 27/20 = 1.35 between A and D?</p><p>Same thing.</p><p>&gt;For 9, 11, 13<br/>&gt;chords, etc., does the dominant harmonies come from the upper note<br/>&gt;intervals, or from the correspondence with the root harmonics?</p><p>I&apos;ve done a lot of experimentation and usually I prefer the former. The only<br/>chords where I _might_ use a ratio of 11 are a 9#11 chord (4:5:6:7:9:11) and<br/>a m9b5 chord (5:6:7:9:11), and only the first of these correspond to root<br/>harmonics. I would never use a ratio of 13 in a jazz chord.</p><p>&gt;I don&apos;t know<br/>&gt;much about this area - I tend to go for the simple harmonies.</p><p>But C6/9 _is_ a simple harmony, considered fairly consonant. It&apos;s not<br/>consonant in JI, though.</p><p>&gt;I find that Ab F C Eb  (descend from Ab, rise to Eb) depends quite a bit on<br/>&gt;the minor third intervals.  Played high on the keyboard, it sounds awful to<br/>&gt;me in 12Tet, and takes on a different feel depending on the minor third<br/>&gt;intervals played.</p><p>So you like the melody better when the minor third intervals are tuned as<br/>_________?</p></div><h3><a id=6019 href="#6019">ðŸ”—</a>johnlink@xxxx.xxxxxxxxxxxxxx)</h3><span>11/8/1999 1:05:15 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>&gt;From: &quot;Paul H.
