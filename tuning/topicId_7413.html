As the &quot;English horn&quot; is neither English<br/>nor a horn (except perhaps in a Jazz terminology, tenuous at best), it is the<br/>name for a concept of sound produced by a concept of instrument which no one<br/>on this list would likely question.</p><p>Music is ineffable, or so I have always been told and have taught.  If we, as<br/>musicians, see value in continuing certain terminology, there may be good<br/>reason.  Linear literalness has value, too, and it may be able to co-occur,<br/>just as different tunings share in our present musical universe.</p><p>Maybe there is a subconscious yearning for some of us to have a &quot;unified<br/>field theory&quot; for the little critters.  It&apos;s the whole reason that Husserl<br/>developed phenomenology: he want to apply mathematical rigor to the process<br/>of description.  It does bring one closer, but it does not complete anything.<br/> The description always continue to unravel.</p><p>I suggest it is more harmful to be intolerant to the distinctive groupings of<br/>terminology as have been expressed on this list, than it is to attempt to<br/>codify absolutely.  There is no perfection in music as any musician knows.</p><p>Anyway, it is just the _sounds_ that the audience hears.  You all might try<br/>that perspective more often as the first perspective tied to the intellect.</p><p>If on a cross-cultural level, in search of the just-out-of-reach universals,<br/>I can conceive of all music as microtonal, who is anyone to tell me<br/>otherwise?  If I hear intervals others don&apos;t hear, could I be convinced<br/>otherwise?</p><p>Logic doesn&apos;t work here, neither would force, nor persistence.  The genie is<br/>out of the bottle and you can&apos;t put it back in.</p><p>Johnny Reinhard<br/>AFMM</p></div>
