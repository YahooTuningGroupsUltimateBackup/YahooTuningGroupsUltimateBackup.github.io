Actually, about a<br/>year ago I switched over to mostly playing my fretless Kramer, because<br/>of the weight difference - a little over three pounds (the Les Paul<br/>weighs in at a nerve pinching 10+ pounds). However, I still much<br/>prefer the playability of the aluminum finger board Les Paul, and<br/>continue to use it for all two-handed-tapping playing, and for its<br/>particular tone (and its previously mentioned playability) on<br/>recordings.

Most<br/>of us excrete the excess without difficulty.  Last I heard, there is no<br/>evidence that cutting back aluminum exposure will reduce the risk of<br/>Altzheimer&apos;s.</p><p>JdL</p></div>
