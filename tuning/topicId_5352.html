The point of part 1 was so for readers to gain familiarity<br/>with the terminology and concepts in the context of some easy examples. Part<br/>2 will deal with 2-dimensional, 5-limit JI, which is where Fokker&apos;s original<br/>contributions (though independently discovered by Kees van Prooijen and<br/>probably others) can be said to begin.</p><p>&gt;After a first reading, it seems to just be another way of saying<br/>&gt;that you can have a closed circle of pitches with some specified relation,</p><p>&gt;and that&apos;s equivalent to any other closed circle on the same specified<br/>&gt;relation, by transposition through some interval.</p><p>&gt;Is that right?</p><p>More specifically, I was trying to point out that the entire infinitude of<br/>3-limit JI (Pythagorean tuning) can be collapsed to a finite set by choosing<br/>just one small interval as your unison vector. Then, no matter how far out<br/>you go along the chain, any note you pick is equivalent to one and only one<br/>of the finite number of notes in your periodicity block. By way of a<br/>familiar geometrical model, the chain of fifths becomes a finite circle of<br/>fifths. This model sounds like what you were referring to. A peek into part<br/>2: in 5-limit JI we need two unison vectors at a time, which would turn the<br/>infinite sheet of fifths and thirds into a finite torus (donut shape). But<br/>these closed geometrical figures are more appropriate when one is discussing<br/>temperament, which may arise from the desire to &quot;hide&quot; the unison vector(s)<br/>by distributing them equally (or unequally) among the consonant intervals.<br/>Fokker himself gave his periodicity blocks in JI, using a (slightly<br/>arbitrary, but of definite quantity) set of JI pitches to which no new pitch<br/>could be added without having a unison vector between the new pitch and one<br/>of the existing pitches.</p><p>Hope that clears things up,</p><p>Paul</p></div>
