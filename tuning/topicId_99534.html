I currently use LilyPond or MuseScore to create MIDI files, Scala to choose tunings, and Timidity++ to render the scores to MP3s using sound fonts. All four of those programs are free to use, and decent free soundfonts aren&apos;t hard to come by.</p><p>If you&apos;re not very digitally knowledgeable, MuseScore (a graphical music editor) is probably better for your purposes than LilyPond (a text-based musical language).</p><p>The advantage of using something like MuseScore to create MIDI files is that some aspects of it (e.g., rhythm) is easy to understand. If you stick to 12-note scales, it&apos;s only a little mind-bending to realize that the C-G interval is (say) 744 cents instead of 700. It&apos;s much more mind-bending to use more than 12 notes in a scale (e.g., A below middle C is 440 Hz, and the A above that is only 816 cents higher, and you don&apos;t hit the octave until you get to E). I tend to stick to 12-note scales for that reason, but there are an awful lot of interesting 12-note scales out there. You can also use fewer than 12 notes by doing things like setting B and Bb to the same pitch.</p><p>To listen to what you wrote, you&apos;d need to get Timidity set up for the first time, but after that it&apos;s not hard to run a command to do the rendering for you. You can also let Scala retune the MIDI file for you. (I hate the sound of MIDI on my computer, though.) It&apos;s a bit of a nuisance to have to process the MIDI file each time, either by retuning it in Scala or running it through Timidity, but I think it&apos;s worth it.</p><p>Switching streams entirely: Another alternative is to get yourself a microtonal instrument or two. Several people on the list have guitars in 17, 19, or other equal divisions of the octave (EDOs) besides 12. Others have retunable keyboards. If you&apos;re handy, you might build your own instrument -- Chris Vaisvil has examples on his website, <a href="http://chrisvaisvil.com">chrisvaisvil.com</a>. I&apos;d love to get a real instrument, especially because nothing beats noodling around on a guitar or keyboard to get instant gratification, but I haven&apos;t yet made the investment.</p><p>Other people may have yet other ideas, but these are things that worked for me. Best of luck to you.</p><p>Oh, yes, and join the makingmicromusic list if you haven&apos;t already.</p><p>Regards,<br/>Jake</p></div><h3><a id=99538 href="#99538">ðŸ”—</a>genewardsmith &#x3C;genewardsmith@...&#x3E;</h3><span>5/25/2011 4:15:09 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, Mike Battaglia &lt;battaglia01@...&gt; wrote:</p><p>&gt; What do you mean by &quot;meantone version?&quot; Standard scores are already in<br/>&gt; meantone versions, aren&apos;t they?</p><p>Not really, because if you ask a program like Sibelius or Finale or NoteWorthy to play something, it will play it in 12edo.

I don&apos;t use it all that much because my microtonal goals do not really include creating computer playbacks; I prefer live performances. Thus, I don&apos;t remember the specific command to pitch bend in Sibelius right off hand. But I can look it up in some files I created a little while ago, and I&apos;m sure that you can get the proper information by contacting Sibelius support.</p><p>It won&apos;t be practical in a piano part; the pitch bending bends every pitch in a given staff. In order to get individual notes played at the same time away from 12-ET, you will need to write in separate staffs for each musical line. The disadvantage of doing this method is the high amount of busywork that it requires to write in all the pitch bends. The advantage is that you can essentially have as many pitches per octave as you desire. Using Scala, in Sibelius you can export a MIDI file that Scala can thus retune, but this is a bit limited because Scala can only map the MIDI file onto what is essentially a retuning of a keyboard layout. I prefer to write in just intonation, which allows a variable amount of pitches per octave (and even some severely unevenly distributed pitch sets) which simply doesn&apos;t work on keyboard setups unless I want to make some very unsatisfactory compromises like notation, skipping large segments of a scale, or severely limiting my choice of notes.</p></div><h3><a id=99557 href="#99557">ðŸ”—</a>lobawad &#x3C;lobawad@...&#x3E;</h3><span>5/26/2011 2:44:34 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>There are many ways to approach microtonality, and there is not even universal agreement as to what &quot;microtonality&quot; is.</p><p>I&apos;d suggest to someone who already has quartertones up and running to explore the ancient Greek tetrachords in all their permutations and junctions, for the genera can be tuned nicely enough with quartertones, and this exploration is great for casting off the burden of the false dichotomy of major/minor, the artificial ordera of diatonic scales, &quot;tonality&quot; and so on.</p><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;genewardsmith&quot; &lt;genewardsmith@...&gt; wrote:</p><p>&gt; The EZ introduction to microtonality plan would get to things like 46 equal only after meantone was mastered.
