Perhaps, at some<br/>point, we can put some of this music up on the Web:</p><p>_________________________________________________________</p><p>Hello Anton!</p><p>The quarter-tone piano music tape from Moscow was really terrific.  I<br/>really enjoyed it.  Many of my impressions were somewhat similar to<br/>yours (which I read again) but some were different as well.</p><p>I really enjoyed the Roland Moser _Cabinet_.  I think he is quite<br/>talented in microtonality.  He was able to really feature the<br/>microtonality as a structural element of his music and it was heard<br/>and utilized clearly.  I enjoyed the Johann Strauss quotations, and<br/>other peculiarities reflected through the 1/4 tone prism.  The fast<br/>section was really wonderful.  I thought it was a terrific work.</p><p>The Ivan Wyschnegradsky _Integrations_ was quite a strong piece but I<br/>didn&apos;t feel it really emphasized the microtonal aspect all that<br/>much... until well into the piece where some clusters could *only*<br/>have been done with something other than 12 equal.</p><p>I didn&apos;t care much for the Sergei Pavlenko _Several Boarderline<br/>Conditions._  It was quite a noisy work with little regard for the<br/>subtleties of the microtonal pitches.  Lots of sound, and<br/>mostly &quot;nothing&quot;... at least for *me* anyway.  There was some nice<br/>figuration between the pianos here and there, but it tended to be<br/>sporadic.  Also, I didn&apos;t really feel in all the noise, that the<br/>microtonal aspects of the 1/4 tone pianos was really featured all<br/>that much.</p><p>Victor Ekimovsky&apos;s _Vers Libre_ I felt showed off the 1/4 tones<br/>nicely.  He seemed to know how to &quot;let them speak&quot; even though the<br/>piece was in a more or less &quot;traditional modernist&quot; mode.  Although<br/>there was a good feeling for microtonality, I felt there wasn&apos;t<br/>always enough preparation of the ear sometimes...too much activity<br/>going on.</p><p>The Igor Kefaldi _For 4X4_ for 1/4 tone pianos and amplified pianos<br/>was *very* interesting.  The attacks made it sound like a little<br/>music box or &quot;machine.&quot;  (I believe you mentioned this also).  He<br/>uses the 1/4 tones in an unusual way to create *timbre.*  Nice piece,<br/>with an engaging tonal background sometimes and *very* clever<br/>rhythmically.  I thought the microtonal aspects were *really*<br/>featured in this work even though it was quite complex throughout.<br/>Very clever.</p><p>The Charles Ives _Three Pieces_ is a classic, and I noticed again how<br/>*integral* the microtonality is to these pieces.  There is<br/>nothing &quot;grafted on&quot; here... it is as much a part of Ives&apos; style in<br/>these pieces as anything else... unusually so.</p><p>So, this was a great concert, and there were a couple of really<br/>magnificent microtonal pieces on it.  I think we agree on most of it,<br/>with a few exceptions here and there!</p><p>best,</p><p>Joseph</p></div>
