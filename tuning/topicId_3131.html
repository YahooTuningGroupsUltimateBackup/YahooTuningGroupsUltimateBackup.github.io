A shame the word &quot;inverted&quot; already has a quite different<br/>&gt; meaning in music. I think I have heard people call it the<br/>&gt; &quot;dual&quot;. Note that the minor 7th above is its own dual.</p><p>There is a tradition of using the word &apos;dualism&apos; to describe<br/>this &apos;inverted major&apos; description of &apos;minor&apos; in 19th-century<br/>German music theory.  It is chiefly associated with the work<br/>of Oettingen and Riemann.</p><p>[Ray Tomes]<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;[me, monz]<br/>&gt;&gt; So, in a musically significant way, the &apos;common multiple&apos;<br/>&gt;&gt; notation *is* less satisfactory than the &apos;common divisor&apos;<br/>&gt;&gt; version, Partch&apos;s use of it notwithstanding.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Just finished replying to the above and then read this.  Are you<br/>&gt; saying the same thing as I am in my second paragraph above?</p><p>Yes.  Dave Keenan&apos;s post appeared before mine and already gave<br/>a better explanation of the same thing I&apos;m saying.</p><p>BTW, Dave, thanks for the excellent summary of the complexity<br/>discussion!</p><p>[Ray Tomes, TD 187.5]<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I saw a home video show recently which consisted of a guy<br/>&gt; playing ...<br/>&gt; [piano] da-da-da-da-dump<br/>&gt; [lid] brrp-brrp brrp-brrp<br/>&gt; [piano] da-da-da-da-dump<br/>&gt; [lid] brrp-brrp brrp-brrp<br/>&gt; where the lid part was sliding the lid closed and then open<br/>&gt; again. It really worked quite well!</p><p>John Cage wrote a piece back in 1942 called _The Wonderful Widow<br/>of 18 Springs_.  It&apos;s scored for soprano singer and piano with<br/>the lid closed.</p><p>In other words, the pianist is really a percussionist in this<br/>piece, as his part consists of tapping or pounding various<br/>places on the wood of the piano.</p><p>Joseph L.

In this<br/>theory, there is not only an uncertainty relation governing the positions<br/>and momenta of the particles, but also the very number of particles existing<br/>at a given point in time. I have not formally studied QFT, but I know that<br/>some of its predictions, such as the magnetic moment of the electron, are<br/>the most accurate (one part in 10^18) in all of science. You will have to<br/>come to terms with all its successes if you wish to propose a competing view<br/>of the universe. OK, that&apos;s enough particle physics for now.</p><p>&gt;&gt;One musical point for Ray Tomes: You are incorrect in your assumptions<br/>about<br/>&gt;&gt;composers&apos; intentions and wandering tonics. Many classical pieces have<br/>been<br/>&gt;&gt;analyzed in just intonation and almost invariably they have a net downward<br/>&gt;&gt;drift in JI, sometimes by as much as half an octave.</p><p>&gt;I am unsure as to what you are saying here.  Are you saying that turning<br/>&gt;a piece into JI commonly (and wrongly) causes this drift in many pieces?</p><p>Yes.</p><p>&gt;If so, I suggest that this depends very strongly on the algorithm used<br/>&gt;in the process.  I dealt with some considerations in this regard a<br/>&gt;couple of weeks ago and it is clear that slightly different algorithms<br/>&gt;can jump to different notes under the same circumstances and introduce<br/>&gt;ratios such as 80/81 etc.</p><p>OK, but these jumps are quite foreign to any accepted performance practices,<br/>and many musical situations (such as the chord d-f-g-a-c in C major) could<br/>not be remedied by such jumps anyway -- the 80/81 must vanish.</p><p>&gt;&gt;Although a solution involving a constant, upward, compensating drift could<br/>&gt;&gt;certainly help in many situtations, it is difficult to see any grounds on<br/>&gt;&gt;which this could be deemed preferable to the adaptive JI schemes that John<br/>&gt;&gt;A. deLaubenfels (sp?) and I discussed.</p><p>&gt;Where is this information?</p><p>As I said, look at the tuning archived just before you rejoines, especially<br/>posts entitled &quot;Adaptive JI&quot;, and note that I often post from Brett<br/>Barbaro&apos;s e-mail account.</p><p>&gt;&gt;I think a better description would relate to chaos theory. The opening and<br/>closing of<br/>&gt;&gt;the vocal folds experiences a period-doubling, so the apparent fundamental<br/>and its<br/>&gt;&gt;overtones are still prominent (due to the dynamics and not the filtering)<br/>but the<br/>&gt;&gt;true fundamental is an octave lower. The way the &quot;subharmonic&quot; almost<br/>&quot;jumps&quot; in and<br/>&gt;&gt;out of existence as one varies the mode of singing is a hallmark of a<br/>nonlinear<br/>&gt;&gt;bifurcation. I refer Jim to any of the popular books on chaos theory, such<br/>as Manfred<br/>&gt;&gt;Schroeder&apos;s _Fractals, Chaos, and Power Laws_.</p><p>&gt;I disagree as it is stated that notes 1/2, 1/3, 1/4, 1/5 the original<br/>&gt;all came in with slight adjustments.  That is not chaotic behaviour but<br/>&gt;undertones.</p><p>I&apos;m not saying it&apos;s chaotic behavior, I&apos;m saying it&apos;s the type of behavior<br/>found en route to chaos. What do you mean by &quot;slight adjustements&quot;? And how<br/>do you propose to physically account for the &quot;undertones&quot;? In steady-state<br/>oscillations, resonant cavities can do nothing more than selectively amplify<br/>frequencies already present. The question is how they get there in the first<br/>place.</p><p>&gt;I should make a bolder statement in regard to this to Paul.  If the<br/>&gt;large playing ground idea is used (which shows what I called C and C-<br/>&gt;etc) then we are in agreement that the piece should end on C and not C--<br/>&gt;or some such if it started on C.  This can be achieved by keeping track<br/>&gt;of the CoG (centre of gravity) as we go along and not letting it get too<br/>&gt;far from the starting place.  This method will ensure that the &quot;breaks&quot;<br/>&gt;will happen at the most correct places where there is considerable<br/>&gt;ambiguity.  Of course this is easier to do well with the whole piece of<br/>&gt;music available than to do in real time where retrospect can play no<br/>&gt;part.</p><p>&gt;For example, in the big playing field ...</p><p>&gt;D--  A-   E-   B-   F#-  C#-  G#-  D#-  A#   E#   B#<br/>&gt;   F-   C-   G-   D-   A    E    B    F#   C#   G#   D#<br/>&gt;      Ab   Eb   Bb   F    C    G    D    A+   E+   B+<br/>&gt;    Fb   Cb   Gb   Db   Ab+  Eb+  Bb+  F+   C+   G+   D+</p><p>&gt;... if we have wandered from D to E to D- and E- we would not want to go<br/>&gt;to D-- but would have a bias built in to pull back to D- instead.  Maybe<br/>&gt;even the first time (E to D-) would have pulled back unless the music<br/>&gt;very powerfully made this move.  Paul, I&apos;m not sure that we can fully<br/>&gt;resolve this without worked examples.</p><p>I would argue that virtually every Western composer since the advent of the<br/>5-limit has been dealing not with the flat playing field you describe above,<br/>but a cylindrical one where the lattice bends back on itself so that<br/>commatic distinctions vanish. Finding the correct place for &quot;breaks&quot; could<br/>certainly be handled as you describe, but would have nothing to do with<br/>anything that went on in the mind of the composer or in the actions of the<br/>finest performers of his/her music. And again, there are cases where by your<br/>reckoning D and D- would have to occur at the same time, in a single<br/>sonority, so even &quot;breaks&quot; would not solve the problem.</p><p>Finally, a note on notation. You are using Ben Johnston&apos;s notation, where a<br/>perfect fifth above D is not A but A+. This is a very confusing notation and<br/>almost everyone who has tried to use it prefers Daniel Wolf&apos;s variant, where<br/>a central Pythagorean row of your playing field would be notated entirely<br/>without +s or -s, and then each row above would gain one more - and each row<br/>below would gain one more +:</p><p>D--  A--  E--  B--  F#-- C#-- G#-- D#-- A#-- E#-- B#--<br/>   F-   C-   G-   D-   A-   E-   B-   F#-  C#-  G#-  D#-<br/>      Ab   Eb   Bb   F    C    G    D    A    E    B<br/>    Fb+  Cb+  Gb+  Db+  Ab+  Eb+  Bb+  F+   C+   G+   D+</p><p>Not only is this simpler and clearer, but it corresponds more closely (at<br/>least for a nice wide stretch of the playing field) to how a 12-tET-trained<br/>performer could play the notes without +s and -s pretty much as usual and<br/>then interpret the + or - as a fixed alteration of pitch. Fokker has<br/>proposed a third alternative, which is that &quot;the commatic stroke is added to<br/>that homonym of a pair, which in the lattice is farther away from the centre<br/>D&quot; (he uses a square lattice). This would also not be a very useful notation<br/>for performers.</p></div>
