It&apos;s using the Tibetan &quot;Ceremonial&quot; Scale (thank you Manuel)<br/>and 152 TET (thanks to Paul) , which I was working on when the<br/>bombings started.</p><p>Tibetans consider accidental death, in which one is suddenly thrust<br/>onto the other side, with little or no preparation, a great tragedy<br/>because the soul is left to navigate the somewhat treacherous bardo<br/>realms without guidance.  The Bardo, or the afterworld, is a realm<br/>and journey the Tibetans are very familiar with. Typically a lama<br/>will chant to guide the soul for up to 29 days after death,  This<br/>work was composed with the idea that perhaps a link could be created<br/>with those who left September 11th that allowed them to access<br/>Tibetan roadmaps in their journey,</p><p>Anyway I&apos;ve put it on my own site where you can download it here.</p><p><a href="http://www.elucida.com/EarthBEAT.html">http://www.elucida.com/EarthBEAT.html</a></p><p>Peace,<br/>Mary Ackerley<br/><a href="http://www.elucida.com">http://www.elucida.com</a></p></div>
