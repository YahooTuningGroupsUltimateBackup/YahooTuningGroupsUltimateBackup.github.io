I have learned, through the ensuing discussion that competitions and the institutional structure around many of them, continues to have an overweighted role in some corners of our profession (a large portion of the response has either been via email, rather than public comments on the blog, showing some fear of being identified as &quot;rocking the boat&quot;).  I am long-since past the age in which I have any interest in entering competitions (for the record, I entered three local competitions while in High School), so I have no personal interest in the question, but I do think discussing it is an ethical matter out of concern for the new music community as a whole.  The comments below may not all apply to the particular competition discussed in this thread, and, indeed, I wish the organizers well, for a competition focused on &quot;UnTwelve&quot; works could be a very good thing, but I must encourage the organizers to fund the competition properly so that no entry fees are required.</p><p>There are legitimate competitions and they can and should play a limited role in the musical community. However, there are a very large number of competitions and festivals in which entry fees for submitted compositions are essentially being used to fund the award and other costs of the competition.    Any organizer who needs to use entry fees to fund a prize has not done the necessary fund-raising and should not be in the business of staging competitions.  Composers are often at the bottom end of the music-funding food chain, and this practice can often be yet another example of music administrators abusing the relatively weak position of composers.  (It is also not unusual now for administrators, recording firms, or broadcasters to insist that the composer play the license fees themselves or the works will not be programmed!)   Some competition organizers argue that an entry fee necessary to &quot;sort out&quot; unserious entries.   The appropriate instrument for doing this is not an entry fee, it is in clear competition specifications.  While there may well be adminstrative costs to a competition, any organizer who needs to use entry fees to cover these costs has not done the third-party fund raising necessary to organize the competition and should not be in the business of staging competitions.</p><p>To my younger composer colleagues:  the decision to enter a competition is you own, and while there may well be considerable institutional pressure to enter competitions and to list prizes on your resume, please consider:</p><p>&mdash; the fact that there are important legitimate composition competitions that do not have entry fees,<br/>&mdash; the possibility that there are competitions which do use their fees to fund the prizes  (a rule of thumb is that every competition can expect 20 entries, so anything less than a 20:1 relationship between the prize money and entry fees is unacceptable)</p><p>and, finally, consider the possibility that competitions, in general, are not an appropriate instrument for determining musical quality.</p><p>Dr. Daniel Wolf<br/>Composer<br/>Frankfurt</p></div><h3>Jacques Dudon &#x3C;fotosonix@...&#x3E;</h3><span>7/14/2009 9:11:55 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Hello Aaron Johnson,</p><p>Nice initiative, but I join my voice to Daniel Wolf : why asking 20 $ to be part of this competition ?<br/>All composers pay already with their time, talent, instruments, software, internet charges etc.,<br/>and the risk you take is to dissuade less fortunate musicians...<br/>Could you not manage your own expenses otherwise, through the CD sales for example ?<br/>Just to share my personnal experience about it, I organized several microtonal music programmations based on calls myself, and I found that the participation response can be somehow very unpredictable (but also it was done in France, where microtonal music are nearly unknown). Anyway I would think entry fees would only add to the difficulty of having the chance to offer a representative panel of microtonal music.<br/>I also had fun in participating in several competitions and wether I got selected or not, I was glad all of them were free.</p><p>Good luck anyhow, inform us of the issue !<br/>- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -<br/>Jacques</p></div><h3>Marcel de Velde &#x3C;m.develde@...&#x3E;</h3><span>7/14/2009 9:25:40 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Well it&apos;s obviously done to raise money for untwelve organisation.Which is a<br/>non profit organisation.<br/>10 people get selected = 10 times $20 = 200 dollar<br/>These 10 people get to sort out / vote which one of these gets the $200.<br/>All people above 10 entering are donating to untwelve.<br/>If 30 people enter it&apos;s a $400 profit / donation to untwelve.<br/>+ the money raised from cd sales.
