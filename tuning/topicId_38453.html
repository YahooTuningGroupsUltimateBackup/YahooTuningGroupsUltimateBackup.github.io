Schulter&quot; &lt;<a href="mailto:MSCHULTER@VALUE.NET">MSCHULTER@VALUE.NET</a>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Hello, there, everyone, and reflecting a bit on this thread, I might<br/>&gt; propose three aspects of Just Intonation or JI:</p><p>&gt;        Harmonic Intonation (HI)<br/>&gt;             The inclusion in a JI system of some small integer ratios<br/>&gt;             with audibly pure or &quot;coupling&quot; partials, e.g. 2:3:4.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;        Combinatorial Intonation (CI)<br/>&gt;             The inclusion in a JI system of some &quot;intermediate&quot;<br/>&gt;             integer ratios where the blending of combinatorial<br/>&gt;             tones can give certain sonorities a &quot;pure&quot; rather<br/>&gt;             than &quot;tempered&quot; effect, as discussed by George Secor.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;        Rational Intonation (RI)<br/>&gt;             More generally, the use of _any_ integer ratios,<br/>&gt;             whether or not they also produce HI or CI effects.</p><p>Hello Margo !</p><p>As I mentioned a couple of days ago I was given much to think about by reading your posts (c. Dec 2000) re. RI, etc. I&apos;ve been taking longer to collect my thoughts than I thought I would(I did say 24 hrs). But now your present post precipitates my posting those thoughts as is, as I think it could be useful for discussion. I will need a little time to think about what you just said and how it fits into my rudimentary ideas. The main issue is that I cannot agree with the limiting mention of JI in the above explanations. &apos;Combinatorial Intonation&apos; certainly gives something to ponder on.</p><p>Try it:<br/>Simply remove &apos;JI&apos; from the HI explanation. Similarly, replace &apos;JI&apos; with &apos;HI&apos; in the explanation for CI. Why ? JI is but a  tiny subset of HI, RI, and CI. Which is why the rest of what you say holds up none the less !</p><p>The way I&apos;ve been able to think outside the JI box, while still being able to consider it&apos;s features is by thinking in terms of the harmonic series. Any reference to a harmonic-anything should at the very least refer to the entire, theoretically infinite, harmonic series.</p><p>I cannot see these as &apos;...three aspects of Just Intonation or JI&apos;. I see them as akin to three approaches to intonation systems, i.e. ways that allow me to view, study, and work with the wider universe of harmonics and tonality.</p><p>Sincerely,</p><p>Joel</p></div><h3><a id=38454 href="#38454">ðŸ”—</a>Joel Rodrigues &#x3C;joelrodrigues@mac.com&#x3E;</h3><span>7/3/2002 10:03:05 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Hello Margo, all,</p><p>As I said, this post is not quite complete, but I felt I had to post it before revising and extending it based on your (Margo) current post. Thanks for your time !</p><p>Sincerely,<br/>Joel</p><p>***</p><p>I am working here mainly from Margo&apos;s posts from Dec. 2000 and the related discussions around that time, as well as other posts.</p><p>Just Intonation : Based on the harmonic series, but limited to intervals with &apos;small number&apos; ratios, ideally with a &apos;beatless locking of partials&apos;. An &apos;aesthetic of beatlessness.&apos;, as Margo puts it.</p><p>&apos;Extended Just Intonation&apos; ? Borders on being an oxymoron.</p><p>Rational Intonation : (quoting Margo) &apos;...based on integer ratios, both simple &amp; complex, but not based on a systematic use of, or preference for the harmonic or subharmonic series.&apos;</p><p>&apos;My longer term &quot;rational continuum intonation&quot; (RCI) emphasizes that not only is the system based exclusively on integer ratios (as are many &quot;harmonic-tuning-oriented&quot; JI systems), but that it favors a continuum of intonational nuances and flavors as defined by such ratios of any desired complexity on a dense number line, rather than a tuning set derived mainly from harmonic/subharmonic relations.&apos;</p><p>Margo, this is exquisite !</p><p>The following are my initial thoughts and comments.</p><p>Monzo (Dec 2000) stated he uses &apos;rational tuning&apos; for all rational tunings, including &apos;those above the &quot;extended JI&quot; limits (37, 43...?) specifically.&apos;  This is inconsistent and a misconception of Margo&apos;s clear explanation.</p><p>RI is not simply, &quot;tuning by integer ratios&quot;. It is not an alternative to JI. JI is a form of RI. JI is a subset of RCI. JI is also a subset of Harmonic Continuum Intonation (see below). I don&apos;t see how Margo suggested it to be the opposite, &apos;in discourse settings where people tend to associate &quot;JI&quot; with integer ratios, I would describe Gothic/neo-Gothic RI and Renaissance 5-limit music as subsets of JI.&apos;</p><p>I find this unnecessarily restrictive:</p><p>        Harmonic Intonation (HI): JI where harmonicity and the<br/>        purest or most beatless tuning of sonorities possible<br/>        is the ideal -- or, from another view, the Partch/Doty<br/>        ideal that ratios should be kept as small as is fitting<br/>        for the musical context</p><p>The above use is restricted to a narrow sense of  consonance of the Helmholtzian, beatless  kind. I know that this is the common use of the term, which is deceptively limited in it&apos;s scope.</p><p>I had just been continuing my thoughts to the concept of harmonic intonation, logically extending from the harmonic series. So, I would have harmonic/inharmonic scales/chords/timbres. Harmonic intonation should refer to the entire continuum of the harmonic series, 2:1 (&apos;octave&apos;) reduced to humanly audible range. It yields a companion to your (Margo&apos;s) RCI, HCI (Harmonic Continuum Intonation). There is much existing use of the term &apos;Harmonic Intonation&apos; which is in accord with this conception.</p><p>        Rational Intonation (RI): JI where integer-based ratios,<br/>        simple or complex, are the distinguishing feature, many<br/>        of these ratios possibly having little if any obvious<br/>        connection with relations between partials, and with<br/>        beatlessness not necessarily a pervasive ideal,<br/>        especially for complex or unstable sonorities (e.g.<br/>        Gothic/neo-Gothic), or in primarily melodic rather than<br/>        polyphonic textures (e.g. ancient Greece a la Bill Alves).</p><p>This makes sense to me only if  &quot;JI&quot; is removed from the beginning of this definition. Your original explanations cited above are complete.</p><p>So, *I* get the following:</p><p>Rational Intonation / Rational Continuum Intonation (RCI)</p><p>Harmonic Intonation / Harmonic Continuum Intonation (HCI)</p><p>RCI encompasses HCI.</p><p>Just Intonation (JI)</p><p>JI is limited to small-number ratio intervals, ideally with beatless locking of partials.</p><p>Small number ratio, beatless (ideally) JI is a subset of HCI, and thus of RCI.</p><p>&apos;Extended-JI&apos;  is an exploration further up the harmonic series, making it easier for interested parties to think simply in terms of HCI.</p><p>Scales are subsets of all these intonations.</p><p>Modes to do with a scale exhibiting different tonalities depending on which scale step is used as a tonal centre.<br/>(This is just a cursory statement, scribbled out in a hurry)</p><p>Tuning is the process of putting an instrument into tune with a scale.</p><p>Harmonic scales/intervals/timbres</p><p>Inharmonic scales/intervals/timbres</p><p>Rational scales/intervals/timbres</p><p>***</p><p>Much of this was typed out in a hurry, trying to get my thoughts down before I lost them.

some of my<br/>views regarding &quot;What is JI?&quot; and related questions.</p><p>My special thanks to you, Joel, for so thoughtfully reviewing some of<br/>my earlier postings, thus illustrating more generally how a person&apos;s<br/>views on this kind of question can shift a bit as the dialogue takes<br/>different turns.</p><p>I wrote a rather long article, but maybe could better facilitate<br/>discussion by posting some excerpts, while offering to make the rest<br/>available either here or via e-mail for anyone curious.</p><p>For an integer-based approach to &quot;just intonation&quot; (JI) or &quot;rational<br/>intonation&quot; (RI), I might suggest this definition along with some<br/>subcategories:</p><p>        (I) Just intonation (JI) or rational intonation (RI):<br/>            any tuning system where all intervals are derived<br/>            from integer ratios, large or small, of which some<br/>            typically will also have an &quot;audibly pure&quot; effect<br/>            based on coupling of harmonic partials (HI) or<br/>            combinatorial tones (CI).</p><p>            (a) Harmonic intonation (HI) involves the audible<br/>                &quot;locking in&quot; or &quot;coupling&quot; of partials, and<br/>                typically involves rather small ratios;</p><p>            (b) Combinatorial intonation (CI) involves the<br/>                perception of combinatorial tones, and as<br/>                George Secor has suggested, can give a<br/>                feeling of &quot;pure&quot; tuning to sonorities<br/>                where the ratios might be too complex to<br/>                support an HI effect.</p><p>            (c) More complex JI/RI intervals or sonorities<br/>                typically arise in a system from simpler<br/>                ratios of HI or CI (e.g. 3:2, 4:3, and 9:8<br/>                in a 3-prime or Pythagorean tuning).</p><p>However, one could also argue as Dave Keenan, for example, eloquently<br/>does, that audible HI (or CI) effects are the essence of a &quot;JI sound,&quot;<br/>whether produced by an explicit tuning system using small integer<br/>ratios, or by performers who might be quite unconcerned with the<br/>mathematics but achieve the &quot;purity&quot;

Since the set of rational ratios on the number line is<br/>    dense, this means that _any_ interval is from one viewpoint either<br/>    just or infinitesimally close to a just integer ratio. I find this<br/>    conclusion an attraction of this definition.</p><p>Here, Gene, I much agree that &quot;tuning by integer ratios&quot; is more of an<br/>outlook than a definition of a musically distinct set of intervals,<br/>although it _might_ invite focusing on such themes as audibly &quot;pure&quot;<br/>intervals, combination tones, superparticular steps, and so on.</p><p>Also, Robert, I much enjoy the idea of using different prime or odd<br/>factors to approximate an irrational ratio such as Phi or pi. Among<br/>other things, your examples suggested to me the convenient rational<br/>approximation of pi as 22:7 (~1982.49 cents),</p><p>Most appreciatively,</p><p>Margo Schulter<br/><a href="mailto:mschulter@value.net">mschulter@value.net</a></p></div><h3><a id=38484 href="#38484">ðŸ”—</a>jpehrson2 &#x3C;jpehrson@rcn.com&#x3E;</h3><span>7/5/2002 11:18:40 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In tuning@y..., Joel Rodrigues &lt;joelrodrigues@m...&gt; wrote:</p><p><a href="/tuning/topicId_38453.html#38454">/tuning/topicId_38453.html#38454</a></p><p>&apos;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I find this unnecessarily restrictive:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;          Harmonic Intonation (HI): JI where harmonicity and the<br/>&gt;          purest or most beatless tuning of sonorities possible<br/>&gt;          is the ideal -- or, from another view, the Partch/Doty<br/>&gt;          ideal that ratios should be kept as small as is fitting<br/>&gt;          for the musical context<br/>&gt;</p><p>***Thank you so much, Joel, for your interesting post.

You&apos;re right about shifting views. I constantly find myself revising my understanding of all manner of subjects. Unsurprisingly, given the nature of things, it seems that in this case we&apos;ve shifted in different directions, looking at the same picture from quite different angles. So needless to say, what follows is not an attempt at &apos;I&apos;m right, you&apos;re wrong&apos;. I know you wouldn&apos;t mistake it for that, but in this forum, it&apos;s a matter of precaution :-)</p><p>&gt; I wrote a rather long article, but maybe could better facilitate<br/>&gt; discussion by posting some excerpts, while offering to make the rest<br/>&gt; available either here or via e-mail for anyone curious.</p><p>I&apos;d certainly love to see the entire article ! I&apos;m OK with it being posted here.</p><p>&gt; For an integer-based approach to &quot;just intonation&quot; (JI) or &quot;rational<br/>&gt; intonation&quot; (RI), I might suggest this definition along with some<br/>&gt; subcategories:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;         (I) Just intonation (JI) or rational intonation (RI):<br/>&gt;             any tuning system where all intervals are derived<br/>&gt;             from integer ratios, large or small, of which some<br/>&gt;             typically will also have an &quot;audibly pure&quot; effect<br/>&gt;             based on coupling of harmonic partials (HI) or<br/>&gt;             combinatorial tones (CI).<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;             (a) Harmonic intonation (HI) involves the audible<br/>&gt;                 &quot;locking in&quot; or &quot;coupling&quot; of partials, and<br/>&gt;                 typically involves rather small ratios;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;             (b) Combinatorial intonation (CI) involves the<br/>&gt;                 perception of combinatorial tones, and as<br/>&gt;                 George Secor has suggested, can give a<br/>&gt;                 feeling of &quot;pure&quot; tuning to sonorities<br/>&gt;                 where the ratios might be too complex to<br/>&gt;                 support an HI effect.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;             (c) More complex JI/RI intervals or sonorities<br/>&gt;                 typically arise in a system from simpler<br/>&gt;                 ratios of HI or CI (e.g. 3:2, 4:3, and 9:8<br/>&gt;                 in a 3-prime or Pythagorean tuning).<br/>&gt;</p><p>My own logic organises the above very differently. I&apos;ve tried to pay attention to etymology, prior and current use, and logical extrapolation.</p><p>Harmonic Intonation : A tonal system in which intervals are derived from the harmonic series, inherently using only integer ratios. The full term for this tonal space is Harmonic Continuum Intonation.</p><p>To me this conception is obvious from the use of &apos;harmonic&apos; as a reference to the harmonic series, *not* &apos;harmony&apos;, which might be what would give rise to your interpretation. I feel this works better, going full circle to, or at least more in line with, the Greek sense of a study of &apos;harmonics&apos;, which I do realise was a bit broader, concerned with tonality.</p><p>&apos;Harmonic&apos; being used as an adjective for both harmony and harmonics is potentially very confusing. I&apos;ve come upon many articles where both senses of &apos;harmonic&apos; are used within a single article, for example with reference to &apos;harmonic tonality&apos; and &apos;harmonic rhythm&apos; (used here to refer to harmony), and &apos;harmonic intonation&apos; (here used in reference to instrument performance/tuning/build quality).</p><p>So, there already exists (quite common, it would appear) use of &apos;harmonic intonation&apos; to refer to the harmonic series, and not to harmony. &apos;Harmonic tonality&apos; is commonly used to refer to harmony, often in discussions relating to so-called &apos;tonal&apos; music. No doubt, this use of &apos;harmonic tonality&apos; can be seen as confusing from a microtonalist&apos;s vantage, since it *can* be interpreted as implying the use of harmonic intonation, rather than of harmony. For what it&apos;s worth, there exists another less used adjective form of harmony, &apos;harmonial&apos;.</p><p>Just Intonation : A tonal system in which intervals are derived from the harmonic series with a theoretic preference for, but not insistence on, small number integer ratios and an auditory preference for beatlessness.</p><p>This is a more complex concept than Harmonic Intonation, though it is commonly approached as a theoretic subset of HI. But, JI brings into play issues of timbre, and words like &apos;pure&apos;. I personally dislike both this use of &apos;Just&apos; and &apos;Pure, but that&apos;s besides the point.</p><p>Combinatorial Intonation :</p><p>Your distinction between HI &amp; CI above seems (to me) too fine and unnecessary. I feel that Combinatorial Intonation by itself supports both your definitions.</p><p>I came across something at &lt;<a href="http://members.aol.com/MetPhys/71phasewave.html#71.2">http://members.aol.com/MetPhys/71phasewave.html#71.2</a>&gt; (don&apos;t ask, at the top of my to-do list is &apos;get a life&apos; - Monzo&apos;s got the right idea), which supports the proposition that &apos;Combinatorial Intonation&apos; can be an umbrella categorisation for both phenomena described by Margo above under HI &amp; CI. The cited page is part of an off-beat site, home page at &lt;<a href="http://members.aol.com/MetPhys/metaphysicshome.html">http://members.aol.com/MetPhys/metaphysicshome.html</a>&gt;.</p><p>Just in case it&apos;s overlooked, there is an unrelated (thankfully !) use of the adjective &apos;combinatorial&apos;, in serial music terminology. &apos;A descriptive term for tone rows in which the second half is a transposed version of the first half.&apos;, &lt;<a href="http://www.omnidisc.com/MUSIC/Glossary.html">http://www.omnidisc.com/MUSIC/Glossary.html</a>&gt;.</p><p>&gt; However, one could also argue as Dave Keenan, for example, eloquently<br/>&gt; does, that audible HI (or CI) effects are the essence of a &quot;JI sound,&quot;<br/>&gt; whether produced by an explicit tuning system using small integer<br/>&gt; ratios, or by performers who might be quite unconcerned with the<br/>&gt; mathematics but achieve the &quot;purity&quot; associated with these ratios.</p><p>Indeed ! This is what I realised yesterday, except that as I said above, CI covers this by itself. I almost see CI as a working definition of JI.</p><p>Combinatorial Intonation can also be seen as a broader perception of the concept presented by William Sethares in &apos;Relating Tuning and Timbre&apos;, &lt;<a href="http://eceserv0.ece.wisc.edu/~sethares/consemi.html">http://eceserv0.ece.wisc.edu/~sethares/consemi.html</a>&gt;.</p><p>Rational Intonation : A tonal system in which the target intonation for a given note is any _integer_ ratio. The &apos;rational&apos; in &apos;Rational Intonation&apos; refers to rational numbers, which involve only integers (whole numbers), and is not a reference to &apos;ratio&apos; per se.</p><p>How/why would anyone put the limitation of &apos;small-number&apos; on HI and RI ?</p><p>&gt; As I also wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; If asked to make a Venn diagram of my JI/RI scheme applying to systems<br/>&gt; based on integer ratios, it might look like this:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;                  |----------------------------------------------|<br/>&gt;                  |  U(niverse)=All tunings                      |<br/>&gt;                  |                                              |<br/>&gt;                  |        |-------------------------|           |<br/>&gt;                  |        | JI/RI  |---------|      |           |<br/>&gt;                  |        |        |  HI/CI  |      |           |<br/>&gt;                  |        |        |---------|      |           |<br/>&gt;                  |        |-------------------------|           |<br/>&gt;                  |                                              |<br/>&gt;                  |----------------------------------------------|<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Here the overall universe or &quot;U&quot; is that of all tunings, with JI/RI<br/>&gt; including all tunings based on integer ratios for all intervals; the<br/>&gt; HI/CI subset includes JI/RI intervals or sonorities with an audible<br/>&gt; effect of &quot;purity&quot; from coupling of partials or perception of<br/>&gt; combinatorial tones.<br/>&gt;</p><p>From my perspective this becomes (with the above explanation still holding with &apos;HI/RI&apos; and &apos;JI/CI&apos; :</p><p>                 |----------------------------------------------|<br/>                 |  U(niverse)=All tunings                      |<br/>                 |                                              |<br/>                 |        |-------------------------|           |<br/>                 |        | HI/RI  |---------|      |           |<br/>                 |        |        |  JI/CI  |      |           |<br/>                 |        |        |---------|      |           |<br/>                 |        |-------------------------|           |<br/>                 |                                              |<br/>                 |----------------------------------------------|</p><p>A similar thing happens to the other diagram.</p><p>As I said before, everything else you say still holds up - in my mind even better.</p><p>Needless to say, this is just my own view.
