She<br/>perhaps needs to look at the bigger picture.</p><p>Following on from the string quartet discussion, I take the view that it&apos;s best to compose the<br/>piece and then find players. I&apos;m keen to write one myself but am all too aware of the weight of<br/>tradition and expectation. Why would a quartet want to play my piece when they can make a career<br/>out of playing the music of three or four composers?  If it was very very good, or perceived to be<br/>by someone influential. Then the &quot;dreaded&quot; microtones could just be the last nail in the coffin.</p><p>Additionally there is the choice of system. I would want some way of producing four part harmony<br/>and handling inversions and voce leading so that I could at least exploit one of the many<br/>resources of a string quartet. I don&apos;t know what Joseph has in mind but I hope he shares his<br/>pre-compositional ideas. I remember taking great pleasure out of working in three voices with<br/>Blackjack in my sketches last year.</p><p>Because I have a real Eikosany instrument I&apos;ll probably work with the Eikosany. I don&apos;t believe it<br/>would make much difference to the eventual players that some of the ratios are high numbered. But<br/>first I&apos;m keen to study some of the existing repertoire.</p><p>I&apos;m having difficulty in tracking down Ben Johnston&apos;s quartets and scores, in fact I can&apos;t find<br/>them anywhere. University libraries over here charge outside readers obscene amounts of money and<br/>last time I checked Edinburgh didn&apos;t have them. I know they were knocking around the list last<br/>year.  If anyone can help I&apos;d be grateful.

Perhaps having absolute<br/>pitch enables me to keep my bearings.  (Before I thought that it<br/>might have something to do with the fact that I change back and forth<br/>from one tuning to another so frequently on the Scalatron, but now<br/>I&apos;m not so sure that&apos;s the reason.)  I&apos;m curious whether Blackwood<br/>(who also has absolute pitch) ever experienced any disorientation<br/>when he played them.</p><p>--George</p></div>
