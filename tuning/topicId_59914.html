You&apos;d expect the overall error to be worse than 12-ET (after all, that&apos;s the point of 12-ET, to be able to play in any key with equally bad errors in all keys), but it would be interesting to see how a well temperament compares with 12-ET when shorter chains in the cycle of fifths are compared.</p><p>When I was playing around with well temperaments a couple of years ago, I put together a Microsoft Works spreadsheet that determined the best and worst major thirds of each temperament. I used the size of the fifths to represent the temperaments instead of the tuning of each note, but one can be derived easily enough from the other.</p><p><a href="http://www.io.com/~hmiller/music/well-temperaments.xlr">http://www.io.com/~hmiller/music/well-temperaments.xlr</a></p></div><h3>wallyesterpaulrus &#x3C;wallyesterpaulrus@yahoo.com&#x3E;</h3><span>8/29/2005 2:27:11 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;Carl Lumma&quot; &lt;clumma@y...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt; What does anybody think of...<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; <a href="http://www.lumma.org/tuning/WellTemperamentComparator.xls">http://www.lumma.org/tuning/WellTemperamentComparator.xls</a><br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; ?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; (There are RMS and TOP worksheets in it.)<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; -Carl</p><p>The TOP formulas don&apos;t appear to be correct.

So I think I&apos;m a P=2<br/>&gt; guy.  But it&apos;d be great to get some tetrads and triads to<br/>&gt; try to compare infinity with a low P.  It&apos;s not immediately<br/>&gt; obvious to me how to calculate examples like 009 vs. 333 since<br/>&gt; the pairwise errors in a chord are not independent.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; The nice thing about minimax, though, is that once you&apos;ve<br/>&gt; &gt; established it over the intervals in a tuning system, you<br/>&gt; &gt; know that the minimax for any particular chords in the<br/>&gt; &gt; tuning system will be less than or equal to the tuning&apos;s<br/>&gt; &gt; minimax.  Not so for mean or for any intermediate value<br/>&gt; &gt; of P.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Ok, that&apos;s a key point.  However, isn&apos;t the &quot;tuning&apos;s minimax&quot;<br/>&gt; here just another &quot;particular chord&quot;, ultimately?  It&apos;s nice<br/>&gt; to think of JI as a lattice, where none of the weighted errors<br/>&gt; exceeds a certain bound.  I agree that&apos;s nice.  But really it<br/>&gt; seems that only the primary intervals matter... yes, I suppose<br/>&gt; mean says that a subset of your basic chord could be worse<br/>&gt; than the entire basic chord.  That&apos;s a pain in the butt, but<br/>&gt; what if it corresponds to reality?  I dunno, I hate to dig up<br/>&gt; the error thing, but it never sat quite right with me.  I<br/>&gt; know Gene and Graham have delivered TOP-like results based on<br/>&gt; RMS... I never took the time to see what those were like.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; Want to move this to tuning-math?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I&apos;m copying this there.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; -Carl</p><p>And that&apos;s where I replied.</p></div><h3>wallyesterpaulrus &#x3C;wallyesterpaulrus@yahoo.com&#x3E;</h3><span>8/29/2005 4:46:13 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;Carl Lumma&quot; &lt;clumma@y...&gt; wrote:</p><p>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;Once again, I&apos;m abusing terminology.
