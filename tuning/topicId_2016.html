When I seemed to catch the 1/1 6/5<br/>3/2<br/>&gt;7/4 chord approximating a 5-6-15-9 chord on 8/5!</p><p>&gt;Besides a vague sound at 8/5, the 7/4 seems to get sharper as I go from<br/>1/1<br/>&gt;5/4 3/2 7/4 to 1/1 6/5 3/2 7/4!  Thinking maybe the dissonant 35/24 was<br/>&gt;throwing things off, I compared the 7/4 - 5/4 and the 7/4 - 6/5 dyads.<br/>And<br/>&gt;noticed no change in the 7/4.</p><p>&gt;This is the most glaring example of an Erlich-type approximation I have<br/>&gt;ever heard.  Can anyone confirm or deny?</p><p>I&apos;ve noticed this sort of thing and definitely attribute the illusory<br/>pitch-shifts to an attempt by the brain to fit each chord into a<br/>harmonic series. Whether JI or tempered, chords which deviate from a<br/>harmonic series will often be &quot;mutated&quot; by the brain. Utonalities<br/>(chords with a common overtone) beyond the 5-limit are more easily<br/>understood as mistunings of lower portions of the harmonic series than<br/>exact selections from high up in the series, so their consonance is<br/>quite delicate (play them quietly so at least difference tones won&apos;t<br/>contribute their decidedly otonal-favoring effects).</p></div>
