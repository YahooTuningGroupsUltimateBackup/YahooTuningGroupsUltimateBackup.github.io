I was wondering if there are any manufacturers of guitars which have<br/>movable frets (much like a sitar or even viola da gamba in nature).  Or,<br/>if anyone knows of a site or book which might explain some technique in<br/>making a fretboard that has movable frets (and is still as playable as a<br/>fixed-fret guitar)</p><p>Thanks,</p><p>-Shaun Van Ault</p><p>Oberlin College<br/>3rd-year composition major</p></div>
