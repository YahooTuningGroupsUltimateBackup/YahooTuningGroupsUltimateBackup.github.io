Of the two 5-limit ones,<br/>&gt; one has some steps smaller than a unison vector, and the other one has<br/>&gt; holes. Let&apos;s look at the 7-limit one (ooh, I wish I had Canright&apos;s program<br/>&gt; now!):<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; The matrix is<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;     -1     3     2<br/>&gt;     -7    -1     3<br/>&gt;      2     2    -1<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; and the lattice coordinates and cents values are:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;           -4          -1           2        1144<br/>&gt;           -3          -2           1         490<br/>&gt;           -3          -1           1         877<br/>&gt;           -3           0           2        1032<br/>&gt;           -3           1           2         218<br/>&gt;           -2          -1           1         379<br/>&gt;           -2           0           1         765<br/>&gt;           -1          -2           0         925<br/>&gt;           -1          -1           0         112<br/>&gt;           -1           0           1         267<br/>&gt;           -1           1           1         653<br/>&gt;            0          -1           0         814<br/>&gt;            0           0           0           0<br/>&gt;            1          -2          -1         161<br/>&gt;            1          -1          -1         547<br/>&gt;            1           0           0         702<br/>&gt;            1           1           0        1088<br/>&gt;            2          -1          -1          49<br/>&gt;            2           0          -1         435<br/>&gt;            2           1           0         590<br/>&gt;            3          -1          -2         982<br/>&gt;            3           1          -1         323<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; The steps range from 49 cents to 63 cents, clearly larger than any<br/>&gt; combination (without repetition) of the unison vectors, which are 5.4, 6.5,<br/>&gt; and 7.7 cents. Let&apos;s use the rotated representation of the lattice:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;      1<br/>&gt;     /|\<br/>&gt;    / | \<br/>&gt;   /  7  \<br/>&gt;  /,&apos;   &grave;.\<br/>&gt; 3---------5<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;                         490<br/>&gt;                           \<br/>&gt;                            \<br/>&gt;                             \     1144<br/>&gt;                              \  ,&apos;<br/>&gt;                              877<br/>&gt;                              /<br/>&gt;               925           /<br/>&gt;                 \          /<br/>&gt;                  \        /<br/>&gt;                   \     379<br/>&gt;                    \  ,&apos;  \<br/>&gt;                    112     \<br/>&gt;                    /        \     1032<br/>&gt;     161           /          \  ,&apos;  \<br/>&gt;       \          /           765     \<br/>&gt;        \        /            /        \<br/>&gt;         \     814           /          \<br/>&gt;          \  ,&apos;  \          /           218<br/>&gt;          547     \        /<br/>&gt;          /        \     267<br/>&gt;         /          \  ,&apos;  \<br/>&gt;        /            0      \<br/>&gt;       /            /        \<br/>&gt;      49           /          \<br/>&gt;    ,&apos; \          /           653<br/>&gt; 982    \        /<br/>&gt;         \     702<br/>&gt;          \  ,&apos;  \<br/>&gt;          435     \<br/>&gt;                   \<br/>&gt;                    \<br/>&gt;                    1088<br/>&gt;                    /<br/>&gt;                   /<br/>&gt;                  /<br/>&gt;                 /<br/>&gt;               590<br/>&gt;             ,&apos;<br/>&gt;          323<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Clearly this is fully connected (that&apos;s what I meant by not having &quot;holes&quot;).<br/>&gt; So it represents a way 22-tET could be &quot;organically&quot; derived from JI via a<br/>&gt; &quot;well-formed&quot; periodicity block. Interestingly, each note in the scale is<br/>&gt; consonant with at most three other notes: either a 5:4 down, a 4:3 down,<br/>&gt; and/or a 7:6 up, or the reverse.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; It is no coincidence that these three (or six, if you count inversions)<br/>&gt; consonances are better approximated in 22-equal than the other three, 6:5,<br/>&gt; 8:7, and 7:5 (six if you count their inversions). Unfortunately, no<br/>&gt; consonant triads or tetrads can be created from this configuraion of those<br/>&gt; three intervals, as the graph above shows.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; The notes falling into two distinct categories like this is a very<br/>&gt; interesting phenomenon (any comments from Paul H. would be much appreciated)<br/>&gt; but on second glance doesn&apos;t appear very organic (unless you mean organic<br/>&gt; chemistry in which case you might see benzene rings in the graph above!).<br/>&gt; Even if, for whatever reason, you chose 5:4, 4:3, and 7:6 as your basic<br/>&gt; consonances, why would you construct them only in one direction on half the<br/>&gt; notes and only in the opposite direction on the other half? Very strange.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Is there a more &quot;organic&quot; 22-tone periodicity block to be found, which has<br/>&gt; all steps larger than the unison vectors (and hopefully even larger than<br/>&gt; their sum), and is fully connected?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;</p><p>-- Kraig Grady<br/>North American Embassy of Anaphoria Island<br/><a href="http://www.anaphoria.com">http://www.anaphoria.com</a></p></div><h3><a id=5172 href="#5172">ðŸ”—</a>gbreed@xxx.xxxxxxxxx.xx.xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx)</h3><span>9/30/1999 3:22:00 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>In-Reply-To: &lt;<a href="mailto:938684587.18792@onelist.com">938684587.18792@onelist.com</a>&gt;<br/>Kraig Grady, digest 335.22 wrote</p><p>&gt; Paul! and the other heads of block here!<br/>&gt;       I still can&apos;t seem to break the code.

The first three columns are taken directly<br/>from Fokker&apos;s paper. These 22 notes are those contained within the<br/>parallelopiped enclosed by the vectors (-1 3 2), (-7 -1 3), and (2 2 -1).<br/>Those vectors again correspond to musical intervals defined as 3 to the<br/>first element, 5 to the second element, and 7 to the third element. They are<br/>all very small intervals (5.4, 6.5, and 7.7 cents) and are called unison<br/>vectors. One property of a periodicity block so defined: Any note in the<br/>infinite (in this case, 3D) lattice is equivalent, via transpositions by<br/>unison vectors, to one and only one note in the periodicity block (in this<br/>case, of 22 notes). In the lattice diagram, I showed all 7-limit consonant<br/>intervals in the scale. Let me know if anything else needs elaboration.</p><p>-Paul</p></div>
