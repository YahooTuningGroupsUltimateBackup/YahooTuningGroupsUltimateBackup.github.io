So, you do have that<br/>right. I can&apos;t say I thought of using John&apos;s scale as a basis for PES -<br/>however, since the harmonic series crowds in together higher up its some<br/>what futile isn&apos;t it. I mean - the worst case I can think of is C and F# -<br/>and if their series coincides at some point then it just isn&apos;t going to<br/>happen out side of a trivial example (C and F# 6 octaves above and<br/>discounting anything about human hearing).</p><p>Chris</p><p>On Thu, Apr 12, 2012 at 4:55 PM, Jake Freivald &lt;jdfreivald@...&gt; wrote:</p><p>&gt; **<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; Obviously I made a grand blunder.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; If you&apos;re going to make blunders, make them grand! :)<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; It looks like you are trying create a scale (or a set of frequencies to<br/>&gt; use as base frequencies in Extreme Stretch, which sounds like it amounts to<br/>&gt; the same thing) that avoids tones that are based on harmonics of some other<br/>&gt; tone in the scale.
