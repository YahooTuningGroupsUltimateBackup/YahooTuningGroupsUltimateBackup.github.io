In terms of &quot;puns&quot;, clearly they are in the same<br/>&gt; place as in the full lattice. In what way are the &apos;tonal rules&apos; of 31 broken<br/>&gt; in the subset? Clearly if you expect all 12 notes to function exactly the<br/>&gt; same way, 12-equal is your only option. So what did you mean?<br/>&gt;</p><p>Generally, the lattice diagrams show the consistent connections. But<br/>there is a connection from any note to any note, and some of the punning<br/>comes from various higher order &apos;aliases&apos; using the same connection (as<br/>an example, how many JI ratios are mapped onto the 12tet tritone).</p><p>A crystal structure is probably required to show the paths that all puns<br/>can take, and without the whole crystal, but rather some collection<br/>of collected vertices, there may be functions in the tuning that are not<br/>accessible.</p><p>As an example, I was working through some 12-out-of-N tunings in 31tet,<br/>trying to maximize the existance of certain intervals in the tuning. I<br/>noticed that</p><p>            ( 7 * 7 ) mod 31 = 18</p><p>which in this tuning means that a chain of 7 &quot;7/6&quot;&apos;s is equal to &quot;3/2&quot;<br/>(after octave reduction). This is present in a full lattice for 31tet<br/>since 7-limit intervals are uniquely represented. I suspect that a<br/>working tonal system in 31tet will take advantage of this in much the<br/>same way augmented triads, diminished sevenths, and various symmetric<br/>scales take advantage of such equivalencies in 12tet.</p><p>Producing a 12-out-of-N scale demonstrating this property can be done,<br/>but selects a different subset of the vertices than one might<br/>choose for having nice major triads, or 4:5:67 chords.</p><p>Bob Valentine</p></div>
