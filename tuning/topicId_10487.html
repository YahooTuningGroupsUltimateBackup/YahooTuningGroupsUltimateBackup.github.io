I don&apos;t know exactly what was<br/>happening, but I will mention that saving the files<br/>with cakewalk changed their tempos for real (IOW,<br/>cake saved its idea of the tempo to the file).</p><p>-Carl</p></div><h3>John A. deLaubenfels &#x3C;jdl@adaptune.com&#x3E;</h3><span>10/11/2000 7:40:23 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Several list members have had trouble, when playing back my adaptive<br/>tunings, with the speed of playback being too slow.  Cakewalk was<br/>the earliest reported program with a problem; then Audio Compositor<br/>and sfront, and possibly others, showed similar behavior.</p><p>Thanks to Ed Borasky for identifying what may have been the problem!<br/>The MIDI file specification is rather bizarre, IMHO, in how it handles<br/>timing.  There are two values, one fixed, the other potentially mutable<br/>which are multiplied (or divided, I can never remember) to arrive at<br/>the actual conversion between clock ticks and milliseconds.  The first<br/>is in the midi file header, the second comes in the form of tempo<br/>meta-events.</p><p>I had read that tempo always defaults to 120 beats/min, and had omitted<br/>an explicit tempo message on account of that.  Apparently, that was a<br/>MISTAKE; some programs assume 60 beats/min and/or other values.</p><p>I&apos;ve modified the program to include an explicit tempo message in all<br/>output files, and invite testing by anyone who has had a problem in the<br/>past.  Please e-mail me privately &amp; request or send a sequence for<br/>tuning; I&apos;ll send you back results (I&apos;m still &quot;estranged&quot; from my web<br/>site).</p><p>JdL</p></div>
