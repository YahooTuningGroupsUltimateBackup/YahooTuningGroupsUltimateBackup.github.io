This<br/>term originated primarily among organ builders, in that when they are<br/>tuning two pipes together and they are almost pure [against one<br/>another], such pipes, when they are sounding together, make a<br/>trembling or shivering sound. The closer they are to being in tune<br/>with one another,....&quot;</p><p>Translator&apos;s Notes</p><p>   1. I have chosen to translate the German word schweben in its<br/>literal meaning: &quot;hovering&quot;. In modern German, schweben has come to<br/>mean the regular periodic variation in the loudness of two tones which<br/>are almost identical in frequency caused by phase cancellation, called<br/>&quot;beating&quot; in English (or its literal equivalent in many other<br/>languages). However, it is clear from reading old German texts<br/>(including Praetorius, who disapproved of the term) that in the 17th<br/>century, schweben meant something more than the simple acoustic<br/>phenomenon. For example, there is no doubt that Gleichschweben does<br/>not mean &quot;Equal Beating&quot;, nor can an interval &quot;beat by 1/4 comma&quot;,<br/>since identical degrees of tempering create different rates of<br/>&quot;beating&quot; depending on the interval&apos;s position on the keyboard, as<br/>Werckmeister explains. He makes a subtle distinction between schweben<br/>and schlagen (literally: &quot;beating&quot;) when he states that the former<br/>gets &quot;bigger and smaller&quot; while the latter becomes &quot;faster and<br/>slower&quot;; using &quot;beating&quot; for both words would obscure this refinement.<br/>Using modern acoustical terminology, we would say that<br/>schweben/hovering exists in the frequency domain while<br/>schlagen/beating exists in the time domain. When a note of an interval<br/>is &quot;hovering&quot; the result is &quot;beating&quot;, and to a certain extend - but<br/>only to a certain extend - the two can be conflated.</p><p>      &quot;Hovering&quot; is in fact a perfect metaphor for the act of setting<br/>a tempered interval. If we think of one note of an interval having a<br/>right and proper elevation above or below the other note, that is, the<br/>position at which it creates a pure interval with the other note, any<br/>slight deviation from this position can be seen as a sort of<br/>&quot;hovering&quot; slightly above or slightly below this proper position.&quot;</p><p>Already<br/><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arnolt_Schlick">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arnolt_Schlick</a><br/>reports about that his tuning benefits from that effect.<br/>Why ignoring that over 500years well approved skills of experts?</p><p>12ET excludes and fails in meeting that subtle effect for the 3rd C-E<br/>with ~14Cents sharp exludes that subtle effect ~7 times away,<br/>as expected in the Baroque well-tuning paradigm<br/>at least C-E should be less than ~2Cents sharp from pure<br/>then just 5/4.</p><p>Just compare the vanishing ~2Cent C-E 3rd:<br/>to it&apos;s ugly ~14Cents off counterpart in 12EDO:</p><p><a href="http://coba.belmont.edu/fac/tappant/piano.htm">http://coba.belmont.edu/fac/tappant/piano.htm</a><br/><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Piano_key_frequencies">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Piano_key_frequencies</a></p><p>None piano tuner can apply that concrete on real strings<br/>made of copper and steel accurately on an acoustic piano.<br/>Attepting that mess results in an horrible atonal cacophony.<br/>How can human ears tolerate an deviating defect ~14cents on C-E?</p><p>The allegdly claimed high fidelity as specificied makes no sense<br/>when trying to obtain an acceptable approximation of 4:5:6 on C:E:G:</p><p>4:5*(1366/1365):6*(788/789)</p><p>or in Cents approx:</p><p>4 : 5 ~+1.3c : 6 ~-2.2c</p><p>versus the more than 10 times worser 12EDO 3rd C-E</p><p>4: 5 ~+14c : 6 ~-2c</p><p>Only heaven knows how long will persist the obsolete 12EDO paradigm<br/>that misleads astray laypersons about alleged human precision<br/>in absurd tuning instructions.</p><p>Forget about as soon as possible the still alive fossil:<br/>12ET = a dozen TEars in my ears!</p><p>A.S.</p></div><h3><a id=73539 href="#73539">ðŸ”—</a>monz &#x3C;monz@tonalsoft.com&#x3E;</h3><span>9/25/2007 2:13:29 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Hi Carl,</p><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;Carl Lumma&quot; &lt;carl@...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; --- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;monz&quot; &lt;monz@&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; Wikipedia is currently asking for a<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; citation for Newton and 53.<br/>&gt; //<br/>&gt; &gt; The only reference i could dig up was the Lindley article<br/>&gt; &gt; from which that diagram was taken.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Do you know of a URL for this article?</p><p>Um, yes ... you mean the one that i provided in the<br/>tuning list post, for which i gave the URL in the<br/>message from which the above quote was taken.<br/>OK, here it is again:</p><p><a href="http://www.societymusictheory.org/mto/issues/mto.93.0.3/mto.93.0.3.lindley.art">http://www.societymusictheory.org/mto/issues/mto.93.0.3/mto.93.0.3.lindley.art</a></p><p>-monz<br/><a href="http://tonalsoft.com">http://tonalsoft.com</a><br/>Tonescape microtonal music software</p></div><h3><a id=73540 href="#73540">ðŸ”—</a>monz &#x3C;monz@tonalsoft.com&#x3E;</h3><span>9/25/2007 2:15:25 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Hi Carl,</p><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;Carl Lumma&quot; &lt;carl@...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; --- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;monz&quot; &lt;monz@&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; Do you know of<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; an earlier instance of a &gt; 1-D periodicity block?<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; No. As i state in my Encyclopedia page<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; <a href="http://tonalsoft.com/enc/p/periodicity-block.aspx">http://tonalsoft.com/enc/p/periodicity-block.aspx</a><br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; it appears that Tanaka was the first to describe and<br/>&gt; &gt; illustrate the concept.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Thanks!<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Do you know what commas K and S are here?</p><p>You must not have been reading my posts in this thread<br/>very carefully.

As temperamental notation can be used for a piece in adaptive tuning, it&apos;s part of the paradigm.  But adaptive tuning of choirs and meantone tempering of keyboard instruments was the dominant paradigm of the 16th century. Adaptive tuning of general temperament classes would have been more interesting but also unrealistic.</p><p>The main pioneers as I see it are:</p><p>Bosanquet -- classification of ETs that&apos;s similar to temperament classes and identificition of (his version of) regular temperaments.  Generalized keyboards.</p><p>Tanaka -- first for kleismatic temperament and periodicity blocks with reference to equal temperament, also mentions schismatic temperament (Helmholtz? Riemann?) and unison vectors (Helmholtz? Ellis?).</p><p>Fokker -- unison vectors as vectors, determinants as (by our interpretation) one element of the mapping, 7-limit periodicity blocks.</p><p>Wilson -- MOS and scale tree, keyboard mappings for either JI or temperaments, regular temperaments pushed to higher limits, more general ways of classifying temperaments.</p><p>&gt;&gt;He was mostly pushing &gt;&gt;the paradigm of his age -- meantone for keyboards.<br/>&gt; &gt; He seems like first to 31... probably almost certainly<br/>&gt; first to 31 on a real instrument.</p><p>So he was the first with a rich patron who could afford expensive instruments.</p><p>Zarlino was the first to precisely define meantones.

But in fact in this text Werckmeister somewhat carefully<br/>uses more than one term: &apos;schweben&apos; and &apos;zittern&apos; and &apos;tremulieren&apos; /<br/>&apos;tremores&apos;. One cannot assume that they are completely interchangeable<br/>and mean the same thing.</p><p>What he actually means (in the places where there is a useful<br/>distinction to be made!) is, I believe:  &apos;schweben&apos; is the temperament<br/>of an interval; whereas &apos;tremulieren&apos; or &apos;zittern&apos; is the audible<br/>beating which under many circumstances is the physical manifestation<br/>of a tempered interval.</p><p>The key passage is at the end where Werckmeister refers to the<br/>difference in theory and practice in traditional meantone-like organ<br/>tuning. He says that the hypothesis of 1/4 comma tempering on the<br/>organ is untrue, and the (major) thirds in traditional tuning actually<br/>&apos;hover&apos; sharp, but because they can&apos;t be made to beat (or waver!) -<br/>literally, cannot be brought &apos;ad tremorem&apos; - the old theorists, and<br/>even the tuners themselves, simply assumed that the tempering must<br/>have been 1/4 comma.</p><p>What does this mean? Can one have thirds that don&apos;t beat (or &apos;waver&apos;)<br/>despite the tempering being less than 1/4 comma? Well, see note 5 at<br/>the end of the translation. It&apos;s because the frequency of an organ<br/>pipe (even at given temperature and humidity) is not an absolutely<br/>fixed quantity, and when two pipes are sounded together they can tend<br/>to approach a pure interval, ie to reduce or eliminate beating which<br/>would otherwise be present.</p><p>~~~T~~~</p><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;djwolf_frankfurt&quot; &lt;djwolf@...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; --- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;Andreas Sparschuh&quot; &lt;a_sparschuh@&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Andreas --<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; May I suggest that &quot;wavering&quot; is an even more apt translation than<br/>&gt; &quot;hovering&quot;?

We do know he was born in Vicenza, and Willaert was the leading musical figure in nearby Venice.  It&apos;s difficult to see how Vicentino wouldn&apos;t have been familiar with the ideas of Willaert&apos;s circle.  Wikipedia also links Willaert with the d&apos;Este family.  Unfortunately, it&apos;s vague about the exact connection with Vicentino (of course we don&apos;t trust Wikipedia anyway, but I&apos;m checking my facts with it, so there).  The Yale edition of Vicentino&apos;s treatise has more details, but I don&apos;t have it to hand.  (Note that the great Gesualdo married into the same d&apos;Este family, and probably inherited Vicentino&apos;s instruments.)</p><p>In addition, Vincenzo Galilei was a student of Zarlino.  So all these theorists were connected in some way with Willaert.</p><p>I&apos;m trying to shift the focus away from individuals and toward schools of thought.  5-limit JI for choirs and meantone for instruments was the emerging paradigm of the day.  Willaert seems to have been an important figure behind it (certainly not the originator).  We don&apos;t have much theory from the time.  You can read about this in Jeppesen&apos;s Counterpoint book.  The culture was still influenced by the medieval guilds, where it was bad to reveal your trade secrets.  We have Vicentino&apos;s treatise because of an accident -- he lost an argument with Lusitano (still following Pythagorean thinking) and to regain face he wrote down his ideas on the enharmonic to show how clever and learned he was.  We can assume that other great musicians and theorists had interesting ideas but didn&apos;t publish them.   Vicentino was probably in the inner circle and so would have known a lot more than we do about all this.</p><p>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Another candidate, though, was his teacher Willaert.

That was revolutionary (pun alert!) and whatever the reason was an important milestone in pre-regular mapping thinking. Closing the circle implies &quot;tempering out&quot; (scare quotes because tempering may not have been implied) the Pythagorean comma.  Unison vectors are dual to mappings.  Whether he meant adaptive tuning, equal temperament, irregular temperament, or strict JI, the fact that he closed the cycle is a regular mapping precursor.  It&apos;s also interesting that the motet seems to work in JI because you wouldn&apos;t expect that for a piece written to demonstrate equal temperament.</p><p>&gt;&gt;There&apos;s also a follow up article:<br/>&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt;<a href="http://www.societymusictheory.org/mto/issues/mto.04.10.1/">http://www.societymusictheory.org/mto/issues/mto.04.10.1/</a><br/>&gt;&gt;mto.04.10.1.wibberley2.html<br/>&gt; &gt; Well he certainly does seem to love Willaert.

I have a very elementary question. On the &apos;Regular Mapping<br/>&gt; Paradigm page&apos; it is explained how JI intervals are mapped to numbers<br/>&gt; of steps in a diatonic scale.<br/>&gt; &gt; In contrast to equal temperaments, what interval you are mapping to<br/>&gt; any given number of steps of the diatonic scale clearly depends on<br/>&gt; which note you start from. That is, the mapping from JI intervals to<br/>&gt; numbers of scale steps is many-to-one, information is lost. Now in the<br/>&gt; case of 10/9 and 9/8, we *want* information to be lost, but not in the<br/>&gt; case of 6/5 and 5/4, which both map to 2 steps, let alone 9/8 and<br/>&gt; 16/15. Why then is the starting note not specified, and does this<br/>&gt; create problems? (Such as an apparent identity of the diatonic scale<br/>&gt; and 7-EDO, at the level of the mapping...)</p><p>Many JI intervals map to one generic interval, the same as with an equal temperament.  The best analogy is with an irregular temperament.  All specific intervals can have different sizes but generic intervals are treated the same way in some senses.</p><p>6:5 and 5:4 both map to thirds.  A third is an interval of 2 diatonic steps.  Whether this is a problem depends on what you want to do.  In some cases musica ficta didn&apos;t distinguish different thirds in notation.  In counterpoint, thirds are interchangeable (but perfect and diminished fifths are not).</p><p>&gt; Of course if one maps to the generators the question evaporates - but<br/>&gt; Gene (who I assume to be the author) seems to be making a point of<br/>&gt; starting off with scale steps.</p><p>You can check the metadata for authorship.</p><p>If you want to distinguish meantone intervals (so 5:4 and 6:5 are different, but 9:8 and 10:9 are not) you can count scale steps on a keyboard (or from 12-equal) along with diatonic scale steps.  Most of the time this is what you will do because conventional notation is a 2-dimensional system.  But you should be able to see where the diatonic numbers come from.  (Also if you happen to know numerical notation...)</p><p>You can look at octaves and generators as well and they carry exactly the same information.  But &quot;a third&quot; could be generated by either four fifths or three fourths.  You need to make the scale unequal to distinguish them.</p><p>I start with scale steps because anybody can sit at a keyboard and count them.  Generators are a more abstract concept.</p><p>&gt; The thing is that specifying the generators of a regular but non-equal<br/>&gt; temperament *doesn&apos;t* tell you what the scale looks like; you have to<br/>&gt; say in addition which notes, in the sense of combinations of<br/>&gt; generators, are in the scale. Yes.  But you can notate music in terms of the generators, as conventional staff notation does.  Some important properties of the music don&apos;t depend on the specific tuning you use (regular or otherwise; tempered or otherwise).</p><p>                 Graham</p></div><h3><a id=73580 href="#73580">ðŸ”—</a>M.

You can find all kinds of papers that mention one piece of a puzzle.  The real pioneers are those who try to put the puzzle together, or make a considerable advance.</p><p>Another thing that deserves mention is this paper:</p><p>A Matrix Technique for Analysing Musical Tuning<br/>C Karp - Acustica, 1984</p><p>I can&apos;t remember exactly what it says.  I think it talks about different ways of representing JI and defines quarter comma meantone in matrix terms.  By the time I read it, it didn&apos;t have anything new to teach me.  Maybe it lists mappings as vectors, in which case it could well be the first such example (but what exactly does Helmholtz/Ellis do?)</p><p>Anyway, I decided to do a Google search.  It&apos;s mentioned by my website, a page on lattices by Carter Scholz, and this paper by Robert Kelley:</p><p><a href="http://www.robertkelleyphd.com/ReconcilingTonalConflicts.pdf">http://www.robertkelleyphd.com/ReconcilingTonalConflicts.pdf</a></p><p>In fact I already have that PDF, which is good because I can&apos;t reach the site today.  One interesting thing is that on older, conference paper doesn&apos;t mention Karp, so he probably didn&apos;t learn anything from it either.</p><p>Oh, this is gettable:</p><p><a href="http://garnet.acns.fsu.edu/~rtk1218/DT&JI.pdf">http://garnet.acns.fsu.edu/~rtk1218/DT&JI.pdf</a></p><p>Kelley&apos;s papers are notable in that they include a matrix of mappings for &quot;diatonic spelling&quot; of 5-limit just intonation.   That probably is the first reference for mapping vectors in real music theory.  The point of the paper is also that considerations of tuning are still valid even if the tuning concerned was never the composer&apos;s intention.  That&apos;s very much a regular mapping idea, and Kelley would be a regular mapping pioneer if he&apos;d done this before us.  As it is, I wonder how much he knows about the new paradigm.  Maybe something because he does cite Monzo.</p><p>Next, how about a Google Scholar search for the Karp paper?   Well, the only citations are from Kelley.  Same as for Fokker&apos;s periodicity block paper (which Google Scholar doesn&apos;t know is online).</p><p>              Graham</p></div><h3><a id=73604 href="#73604">ðŸ”—</a>monz &#x3C;monz@tonalsoft.com&#x3E;</h3><span>9/27/2007 10:30:13 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Hi Tom,</p><p>Wow, thanks very much for that.

Upon review of the text, it&apos;s clear -- if the<br/>disctinctions between terms are in fact important, that we need a<br/>term with both an adjective and a noun form.  Hoovering, wavering,<br/>floating (the term my wife and son prefer), and hanging won&apos;t quite<br/>do, so I cam round to suspended/suspension, despite its use in other<br/>musical contexts, simply because schweben/Schwebungen are always in<br/>relationship to a pure interval, hung or suspended from such.<br/>However, if what we&apos;re after is a practical modern translation, the<br/>best might be to simply go with temper/tempering. Werckmeister,<br/>conveniently, reserves the noun _Temperatur_ for the entire keyboard<br/>temperament, so these terms would be available in an English<br/>translation without much ambiguity. But the concern here seems to be<br/>not to give up the connotations of &quot;schweben&quot;. So, here goes: a bit<br/>of quick translation of some relevant parts of the text:</p><p>&quot;Temperament originated because, in the use of the keyboard, one<br/>cannot have all consonances pure when one moves from one chord to<br/>another, so one must therefore give something to one consonance and<br/>take something away from another so that a tolerable and pleasing<br/>temperament is thereby created. Now when one consonance is somewhat<br/>higher or lower in comparison to the others, one calls this suspended<br/>(Schweben). This name comes principally from organ builders, because<br/>when two pipes are tuned together and the (tunings of the two) are<br/>nearly pure, then such pipes will make  -- if they are played<br/>together -- a trembling (Tremoren) or shaking (Zittern). Now, the<br/>closer the tuning (of the two together) is, the slower the trembling<br/>will be, but when they are finally tuned together, the trembling or<br/>the shaking (Beben) allows itself no longer to be heard, and such<br/>pairs whistle as if they were one pipe: this trembling or shaking is<br/>called suspending (Schweben) by the organ builders...&quot;</p><p>&quot;When the upper key is too high compared with other, this is called<br/>suspended (Schweben) above; if it is too low one calls it suspended<br/>below or vice versa.  If the upper key is too high compared to the<br/>lower, one says that the lower is is suspended below, in the same way<br/>that a tail hangs from a dog and a dog can hang from its tail. These<br/>terms are often the source of misunderstandings, so that one cannot<br/>understand another, and through which quarrels and conflicts between<br/>musicians are created...&quot;</p><p>&quot;But when these suspensions (Schwebungen) or tremblings on stringed<br/>instruments -- spinets, clavichords, and the like -- cannot so<br/>clearly be understood...&quot;</p><p>&quot;...: this requires experience to know whether these consonances<br/>against the others must be suspended by 1, 2, or 3 quarter commas.<br/>So, indeed, the poor ear cannot accurately know whether these<br/>suspensions are too large or too small, or whether they beat<br/>(schlagen) too slowly or too rapidly. There is also a great<br/>difference if two large or two small pipes are tuned together. For<br/>example, I have tuned the octaves to c and c&apos;...<br/>&quot;   ).</p><p>djw</p></div><h3><a id=73615 href="#73615">ðŸ”—</a>Afmmjr@aol.com</h3><span>9/28/2007 10:34:52 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>&gt; Graham wrote...<br/>Right, and we don&apos;t have any  theoretical descriptions from<br/>the 16th century.

Maybe you &gt; never heard any of his musical compositions (which  I find damn good).  Did you &gt; know Vicentino built keyboards to play upon, as  he was a great keyboardist.  &gt; BTW, his ideas did catch on...if slowly.

I said in the quote that he built keyboards.</p><p>Nowhere have I seen him outline a theory of adaptive tuning.</p><p>&gt; The enharmonic bit was a result of the Renaissance&apos;s late  translations of &gt; its musical writings, and their limited absorption.   Enharmonic stood for the &gt; use of smaller intervals, indicated with a small dot  above the notehead in &gt; order to advance the pitch a dieses.  Vicentino  wanted to force fit music&apos;s &gt; enharmonic genus, as with other &quot;sciences&quot;  described in antiquity, into the &gt; Renaissance.  In that he &quot;failed.&quot;</p><p>What does this have to do with adaptive tuning?</p><p>&gt; When I first looked at Carl&apos;s list, Vicentino was notable as  the only &gt; professional musician.  That Vicentino could imagine, design,  and perform, only to &gt; gain fame through history for his several accomplishments  speaks bounds to &gt; me.

Why does<br/>&gt; 41 in general sound &quot;softer&quot; and more limpid to me?</p><p>I can&apos;t say much about this because I don&apos;t listen to such large ETs as single entities.  The general sound will depend on what generators I think in terms of and a whole load of other contextual things.</p><p>Usually I think of rank 2 temperaments.  That gives me a free parameter (I leave octaves pure) to tweak to get a sound I&apos;m happy with.  It&apos;s good to have that freedom.</p><p>The automated searches, and the theory behind them, are mainly for sorting good temperament classes from bad.  When it comes to good approximations (which I find make sense harmonically) and simple mappings (which are also important to me) there aren&apos;t usually very many choices left.  So there isn&apos;t a great need to make the search more intelligent.  It can always do with being faster and simpler.</p><p>&gt; I checked late last night and lucked out, finding a possible<br/>&gt; explanation at first try. Lucky because I checked the &quot;neutral &gt; third&quot; first &gt; and then a simple aspect of what I believe is part of an &gt; interval&apos;s &quot;character family&quot;, which is it&apos;s place in<br/>&gt; an &quot;o- (u-)tonality&quot;. As far as neutral thirds go, the first thing I see (which is different from hearing) is that 41 has a single neutral third: the fifth splits into equal parts.  46, however, has two different candidates for a neutral third.</p><p>I find it much simpler to think of tunings that have only one neutral third, like 41.  Any temperament where 11:9 and 18:11 will have such a neutral third.  For that matter, any interval that equally divides a perfect fifth can be considered an approximation of 11:9 as long as you think in terms of such approximations.  Hence tempering out 243:242 and having a single neutral third can be considered identical concepts.  Looking for temperament classes that temper out 243:242 is a great way of finding tunings with a single neutral third.  Whether you really wanted an approximation of 11:9 or an equal division of a perfect fifth doesn&apos;t matter at all because the result is the same.</p><p>It also follows that, because 243:242 is quite a simple interval, good 11-limit temperaments with a certain range of error will naturally temper out 243:242 and so have a single neutral third.  That means looking for 11-limit temperaments can be a good way of finding tunings with a single neutral third.  If all you wanted was neutral thirds there&apos;ll be some noise because of the other intervals that get considered but you might find something interesting.</p><p>&gt; for 46<br/>&gt; Temperings of       &gt; 11/10       11/9        11/8        11/7        11/6<br/>&gt; -8.4825     -8.2775     -3.4919      0.1167     -5.8847<br/>&gt; &gt; for 41<br/>&gt; Temperings of &gt; 11/10       11/9        11/8        11/7        11/6<br/>&gt; 10.6055     3.8116      4.7796      7.7519      4.2956<br/>&gt; &gt; Both these series are represented quite well, IMO.

You&apos;re happy with errors of a few cents now?</p><p>&gt; This 11/x series, in both 41 and 46, flies very well<br/>&gt; solo, as a coherent whole- with many real-life timbres<br/>&gt; and orchestrations it would do &quot;that thing&quot; as far as<br/>&gt; being perceived as a JI series, just fine.

Why would $DEITY have created both temperaments if they sounded the same?

It doesn&apos;t have to be all or nothing.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; Lessee, a specific example. What&apos;s something audibly different<br/>&gt; &gt; about 41 and 46 equal, as far as interval character? (We<br/>&gt; &gt; were discussing these the other day). Why does<br/>&gt; &gt; 41 in general sound &quot;softer&quot; and more limpid to me?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I can&apos;t say much about this because I don&apos;t listen to such<br/>&gt; large ETs as single entities.</p><p>41 or 46 are stretching it as far equal divisions as single<br/>entities, IMO. Anyway I&apos;ve been talking about a specific<br/>subset in this case (11/x)</p><p>&gt;The general sound will depend<br/>&gt; on what generators I think in terms of and a whole load of<br/>&gt; other contextual things.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Usually I think of rank 2 temperaments.  That gives me a<br/>&gt; free parameter (I leave octaves pure) to tweak to get a<br/>&gt; sound I&apos;m happy with.  It&apos;s good to have that freedom.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; The automated searches, and the theory behind them, are<br/>&gt; mainly for sorting good temperament classes from bad.  When<br/>&gt; it comes to good approximations (which I find make sense<br/>&gt; harmonically) and simple mappings (which are also important<br/>&gt; to me) there aren&apos;t usually very many choices left.  So<br/>&gt; there isn&apos;t a great need to make the search more<br/>&gt; intelligent.  It can always do with being faster and simpler.</p><p>Of course with subsets of huge EDOs you can have a big pile of<br/>poor approximations and still be in business, who cares if they&apos;re<br/>crap if you don&apos;t use them?</p><p>It seems to me that something MOSs could do very well is just<br/>that- act as a sieve.</p><p>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; I checked late last night and lucked out, finding a possible<br/>&gt; &gt; explanation at first try. Lucky because I checked the &quot;neutral<br/>&gt; &gt; third&quot; first<br/>&gt; &gt; and then a simple aspect of what I believe is part of an<br/>&gt; &gt; interval&apos;s &quot;character family&quot;, which is it&apos;s place in<br/>&gt; &gt; an &quot;o- (u-)tonality&quot;.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; As far as neutral thirds go, the first thing I see (which is<br/>&gt; different from hearing) is that 41 has a single neutral<br/>&gt; third: the fifth splits into equal parts.  46, however, has<br/>&gt; two different candidates for a neutral third.</p><p>And they&apos;re a bit strange, kind of like disjunct 11/9s inside<br/>the fifth.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I find it much simpler to think of tunings that have only<br/>&gt; one neutral third, like 41.  Any temperament where 11:9 and<br/>&gt; 18:11 will have such a neutral third.  For that matter, any<br/>&gt; interval that equally divides a perfect fifth can be<br/>&gt; considered an approximation of 11:9 as long as you think in<br/>&gt; terms of such approximations.  Hence tempering out 243:242<br/>&gt; and having a single neutral third can be considered<br/>&gt; identical concepts.  Looking for temperament classes that<br/>&gt; temper out 243:242 is a great way of finding tunings with a<br/>&gt; single neutral third.  Whether you really wanted an<br/>&gt; approximation of 11:9 or an equal division of a perfect<br/>&gt; fifth doesn&apos;t matter at all because the result is the same.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; It also follows that, because 243:242 is quite a simple<br/>&gt; interval, good 11-limit temperaments with a certain range of<br/>&gt; error will naturally temper out 243:242 and so have a single<br/>&gt; neutral third.  That means looking for 11-limit temperaments<br/>&gt; can be a good way of finding tunings with a single neutral<br/>&gt; third.  If all you wanted was neutral thirds there&apos;ll be<br/>&gt; some noise because of the other intervals that get<br/>&gt; considered but you might find something interesting.</p><p>I was considering the 11/x series, of which 11/9 is a part,<br/>of course.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; for 46<br/>&gt; &gt; Temperings of<br/>&gt; &gt; 11/10       11/9        11/8        11/7        11/6<br/>&gt; &gt; -8.4825     -8.2775     -3.4919      0.1167     -5.8847<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; for 41<br/>&gt; &gt; Temperings of<br/>&gt; &gt; 11/10       11/9        11/8        11/7        11/6<br/>&gt; &gt; 10.6055     3.8116      4.7796      7.7519      4.2956<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; Both these series are represented quite well, IMO. The total<br/>&gt; &gt; absolute &quot;error&quot; is very similar between the two. Both are<br/>&gt; &gt; consistent as far as sign (0.1167 cents difference we can<br/>&gt; &gt; safely consider as untempered in discussion- differences<br/>&gt; &gt; that small only matter in private, I believe). Both this<br/>&gt; &gt; consistency in sign as well as the sheer distances are<br/>&gt; &gt; part of what makes these good approximations- audibly good.<br/>&gt; &gt; In the case of 41, a timbre with an 11th partial 6 cents low,<br/>&gt; &gt; this particular JI series might be so closely represented that<br/>&gt; &gt; we could ignore sign.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; You&apos;re happy with errors of a few cents now?</p><p>That&apos;s not what I said. For the specific 11/x series we&apos;re<br/>looking at here, the &quot;errors&quot; are of the same sign, and<br/>close in size, so the 11/x series is cohesive. In the<br/>case of 41, if you play this series without the tonic,<br/>it&apos;s damn close to a pure 11/x in sound- against the tonic,<br/>the cohesive nature assures character and it doesn&apos;t sound<br/>like a bunch of &quot;approximations&quot;. A little high,<br/>a little low, a flier... no I would not be happy with that.</p><p>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; This 11/x series, in both 41 and 46, flies very well<br/>&gt; &gt; solo, as a coherent whole- with many real-life timbres<br/>&gt; &gt; and orchestrations it would do &quot;that thing&quot; as far as<br/>&gt; &gt; being perceived as a JI series, just fine. In a tonal<br/>&gt; &gt; context, against the 1/1, it loses more purity, and more<br/>&gt; &gt; importantly IMO the character is different. Better or<br/>&gt; &gt; worse or more appropriate for which tune, all that<br/>&gt; &gt; would be subjective, but whatever: they&apos;re different.<br/>&gt; &gt; Different sound. To me, that matters.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Why would $DEITY have created both temperaments if they<br/>&gt; sounded the same?</p><p>Why, indeed?</p><p>&gt;You can also shrink the octaves of 41 and<br/>&gt; stretch those of 46 to even out the errors (and get a<br/>&gt; different sound).</p><p>41 would still suck as far as the x/11 series. 34 sidesteps<br/>both series by quite consistently splitting the difference,<br/>so to speak, with other series (7s for example). I think<br/>the &quot;regular mapping paradigm&quot; would benefit from applying<br/>itself to these kinds of series, like the series derived<br/>from an imaginary partial lying at the harmonic mean of<br/>7 and 11, for example. But since I&apos;ve been waving the flag<br/>for this kind of thing for a long time now, it&apos;s sure to be<br/>ignored or pooh-poohed &quot;considering the source&quot;, LOL.</p><p>&gt; &gt; I find myself in agreement, in general, with most perceptions<br/>&gt; &gt; of dissonance that have been expressed around here. That is,<br/>&gt; &gt; brute dissonance. But I am convinced  that consonance and<br/>&gt; &gt; dissonance aren&apos;t opposite poles or even mutually exclusive,<br/>&gt;take a<br/>&gt; &gt; gander at 7/6.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Well, that&apos;s it.  &quot;Brute dissonance&quot; is what we&apos;re talking<br/>&gt; about.</p><p>Well, I just don&apos;t buy brute dissonance as a measure of<br/>a tuning&apos;s validity at all, nor do I find that brute<br/>dissonance agrees very much with contextual (musical)<br/>dissonance and consonance.

And the closer two notes get, the less difference it makes what kind of mean you take.  Each new harmonic is the arithmetic mean of two other harmonics.  So you can get similar results by looking at higher prime limits.  In the case of 34, you ignore the poor approximation to 7.  By my figures, 34-equal is a standout approximation to various limits up to 1.3.5.11.13.17.19.23.</p><p>Whether your aim is to look at higher limits with no sevens, or only to split the differences within lower limits, it doesn&apos;t matter.  The result is the same.  And the result partly depends on the approximation to 7:1 being so glaringly bad (and all the signs agreeing).</p><p>&gt; Well, I just don&apos;t buy brute dissonance as a measure of &gt; a tuning&apos;s validity at all, nor do I find that brute &gt; dissonance agrees very much with contextual (musical)<br/>&gt; dissonance and consonance.

The thirds in 12-equal don&apos;t sound at all like their just counterparts.  Similarly, the &quot;Decatonic Swing&quot; Paul and his band made in 22-equal makes perfect harmonic sense to me.  It doesn&apos;t matter that 22-equal, under laboratory conditions, doesn&apos;t have the same sound as 7-limit JI.</p><p>I&apos;m also generally happy with 11-limit harmony in miracle. Although I&apos;m recently finding that I prefer the approximation to 11:8 to that of 7:5.  Maybe it&apos;s because of the accuracy.</p><p>                   Graham</p></div><h3><a id=73710 href="#73710">ðŸ”—</a>Cameron Bobro &#x3C;misterbobro@yahoo.com&#x3E;</h3><span>10/3/2007 5:58:18 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, Graham Breed &lt;gbreed@...&gt; wrote:</p><p>&gt; When it comes to actual music, you can always use your ears<br/>&gt; to judge the sound.

There still won&apos;t be many<br/>&gt; temperament classes to pick through for the other properties<br/>&gt; you want.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I find that 41-equal does work in the 9-limit.  Magic is a<br/>&gt; good way of mapping it.</p><p>Can you give me a specific example, Scala file preferably,<br/>of 41-equal &quot;magic&quot; mapped?</p><p>&gt;And the 11/x series without the<br/>&gt; tonic is really the 9-limit.</p><p>Yes, you&apos;ve got the superparticulars expanding from 10/9.<br/>Surely you see one reason I&apos;m concerned with consistency<br/>in the series itself, not just absolute proximity to<br/>the Just intervals themselves?</p><p>&gt;I don&apos;t have a page on magic,<br/>&gt; but I do have this graph:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; <a href="http://x31eq.com/pics/magic.png">http://x31eq.com/pics/magic.png</a><br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; 41 would still suck as far as the x/11 series. 34 sidesteps<br/>&gt; &gt; both series by quite consistently splitting the difference,<br/>&gt; &gt; so to speak, with other series (7s for example). I think<br/>&gt; &gt; the &quot;regular mapping paradigm&quot; would benefit from applying<br/>&gt; &gt; itself to these kinds of series, like the series derived<br/>&gt; &gt; from an imaginary partial lying at the harmonic mean of<br/>&gt; &gt; 7 and 11, for example. But since I&apos;ve been waving the flag<br/>&gt; &gt; for this kind of thing for a long time now, it&apos;s sure to be<br/>&gt; &gt; ignored or pooh-poohed &quot;considering the source&quot;, LOL.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; You can use any partials you like with my library.  But I<br/>&gt; don&apos;t think you need to in this case.  (And wouldn&apos;t your<br/>&gt; specific example give 77:9, not a good match to 34?)</p><p>Yeah, sorry for mixing examples (34 has another thing<br/>going IMO, which I&apos;ll get around to writing out sometime).<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; The higher up the harmonic series goes, the closer the<br/>&gt; partials get.  And the closer two notes get, the less<br/>&gt; difference it makes what kind of mean you take.  Each new<br/>&gt; harmonic is the arithmetic mean of two other harmonics.  So<br/>&gt; you can get similar results by looking at higher prime<br/>&gt; limits.  In the case of 34, you ignore the poor<br/>&gt; approximation to 7.  By my figures, 34-equal is a standout<br/>&gt; approximation to various limits up to 1.3.5.11.13.17.19.23.</p><p>Sure- 23d partial &quot;does&quot; 34 remarkably well on it&apos;s own, as I&apos;ve<br/>mentioned several times over the last year.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Whether your aim is to look at higher limits with no sevens,<br/>&gt; or only to split the differences within lower limits, it<br/>&gt; doesn&apos;t matter.  The result is the same.</p><p>More or less, but as far as audibility, I think it&apos;s better<br/>to go for harmonic means of audible partials rather than<br/>ratios based on partials of dubious audibility. Also you<br/>steer clear of crap like magic primes.</p><p>&gt;And the result<br/>&gt; partly depends on the approximation to 7:1 being so<br/>&gt; glaringly bad (and all the signs agreeing).</p><p>Exactly! Vice into virtue. I&apos;d rather have rock-solid<br/>higher-partials/more-complex series in a tuning than<br/>lumpy references to the lowest partials. Easier to<br/>sing, to cut to the chase.</p><p>&gt; &gt; Well, I just don&apos;t buy brute dissonance as a measure of<br/>&gt; &gt; a tuning&apos;s validity at all, nor do I find that brute<br/>&gt; &gt; dissonance agrees very much with contextual (musical)<br/>&gt; &gt; dissonance and consonance. But different strokes...<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I&apos;m happy that tension and release works in 12-equal with<br/>&gt; 5-limit rules.</p><p>Doesn&apos;t work for me- I hear neither true tension nor true<br/>release in 12-equal, and haven&apos;t since earliest memory. I<br/>remember cringing when I first heard in school that the M3<br/>was &quot;happy&quot; and &quot;peaceful&quot;. What, that theatrical grimace<br/>is supposed to be a smile?</p><p>&gt;And the approximation is quite extreme<br/>&gt; there.</p><p>It&apos;s not an approximation. Different interval.</p><p>&gt;The thirds in 12-equal don&apos;t sound at all like their<br/>&gt; just counterparts.</p><p>They sound quite a bit like 81/64 to me.</p><p>&gt; Similarly, the &quot;Decatonic Swing&quot; Paul<br/>&gt; and his band made in 22-equal makes perfect harmonic sense<br/>&gt; to me.  It doesn&apos;t matter that 22-equal, under laboratory<br/>&gt; conditions, doesn&apos;t have the same sound as 7-limit JI.</p><p>Have to listen again to that one.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I&apos;m also generally happy with 11-limit harmony in miracle.<br/>&gt; Although I&apos;m recently finding that I prefer the<br/>&gt; approximation to 11:8 to that of 7:5.  Maybe it&apos;s because of<br/>&gt; the accuracy.</p><p>Once again, I&apos;d need a definition of &quot;11-limit&quot; and a Scala<br/>file illustrating this.</p><p>-Cameron Bobro</p></div><h3><a id=73714 href="#73714">ðŸ”—</a>Carl Lumma &#x3C;carl@lumma.org&#x3E;</h3><span>10/3/2007 9:45:44 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Graham wrote...</p><p>&gt; There&apos;s a graph of the 11-limit approximations here:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; <a href="http://x31eq.com/miracle.htm#approx">http://x31eq.com/miracle.htm#approx</a></p><p>116.8 looks perfect to me.

So for now all we have is a &gt;&gt;crude model for one dimension of the sound.<br/>&gt; &gt; Well there&apos;s no law that says you have to read or<br/>&gt; understand everything I write, and certainly it&apos;s<br/>&gt; possible that I have no writing skills. It&apos;s a plain statement of fact that you haven&apos;t provided us with a quantitative theory.  Why do you have to get confrontational about it?</p><p>&gt; What do you mean by &quot;11-limit&quot;? (Serious question).</p><p>Ratios of odd numbers no greater than 11 and their octave equivalents.</p><p>&gt;&gt;&gt;That&apos;s not what I said. For the specific 11/x series we&apos;re<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt;looking at here, the &quot;errors&quot; are of the same sign, and &gt;&gt;&gt;close in size, so the 11/x series is cohesive. In the &gt;&gt;&gt;case of 41, if you play this series without the tonic,<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt;it&apos;s damn close to a pure 11/x in sound- against the tonic,<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt;the cohesive nature assures character and it doesn&apos;t sound<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt;like a bunch of &quot;approximations&quot;. A little high,<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt;a little low, a flier... no I would not be happy with that.<br/>&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt;You mean they do sound like a bunch of approximations?<br/>&gt; &gt; I don&apos;t know how you get that out of &quot;it doesn&apos;t sound<br/>&gt; like a bunch of &quot;approximations&quot;.</p><p>Unfortunately, so many people use &quot;do&quot; and &quot;don&apos;t&quot; interchangeably that you have to guess what they really mean from the context.  If you stand by what you wrote, how does &quot;damn close&quot; not imply &quot;approximation&quot;?</p><p>&gt;&gt; From the figures you&apos;ve got there, the worst interval of 46 &gt;&gt;does not involve the tonic.  And the worst interval from 41 &gt;&gt;without the tonic is still over 6 cents.  To me, these would &gt;&gt;be &quot;fairly large&quot; errors.<br/>&gt; &gt; Error from 11/x, in relation to the tonic, yes. Without the<br/>&gt; tonic, the intervals are centered around a virtual partial &gt; some 7+ cents lower than 11. The maximum error is &lt;3.4 cents.<br/>&gt; In other words, taken on it&apos;s own, this particular series<br/>&gt; is consistent in proportions with an 11/x series. Against &gt; the tonic, it&apos;s consistent with a detuned 11th partial,<br/>&gt; therefore consistent in character. It&apos;s not great- I just<br/>&gt; grabbed 41 as an example- but it doesn&apos;t suck.</p><p>This &quot;virtual partial&quot; is similar to the mean implied in calculating the standard deviation.  So you seem to agree with my logic in using standard deviations to rate errors where you don&apos;t temper the octaves.  That&apos;s good because nobody else understands it.  Note that if you do optimize the octaves, the virtual partial will end up with a near zero error.</p><p>&gt;&gt;As a benchmark, the worst interval in 11-limit minimax &gt;&gt;miracle is 3.3 cents from just.  41-equal is about twice as &gt;&gt;bad by the TOP-RMS measure.  And miracle is what I&apos;ll &gt;&gt;normally use in the 11-limit.  41 is outside the range I&apos;d &gt;&gt;use.  So if the argument is that you lose the 11-limit &gt;&gt;character when you reach 41-equal, I&apos;m in agreement.<br/>&gt; &gt; Can you give me a specific &quot;minimax&quot; example? 3.3 cents maximum &gt; error from a simpler series, even<br/>&gt; plus or minus, with no fliers, would be very good indeed. But in<br/>&gt; the Scala archive I find for example:</p><p>You bet it&apos;s good!</p><p>&gt; Canasta with Secor&apos;s minimax generator of 116.7155941 cents (5:9 &gt; exact). XH5, 1976</p><p>That&apos;s exactly what I get.  My generator is 116.7155940982074 cents.  (May not be accurate to that precision.)  I can&apos;t find this file in my Scala archive, however, so I can&apos;t check it.  The mapping by octaves and generators for miracle is</p><p>&lt;1, 1, 3, 3, 2]<br/>&lt;0, 6, -7, -2, 15]</p><p>&gt; |<br/>&gt; Temperings of       &gt; 11/10       11/9        11/8        11/7        11/6<br/>&gt;          &gt; -15.4446     2.7388     -0.5840     -16.5104     1.0774<br/>&gt; &gt; which leaves me scratching my head, for it&apos;s a typical<br/>&gt; example of &quot;hodge-podge approximations&quot; for this<br/>&gt; particular 11s series. That&apos;s plain wrong.  The errors in primes should be</p><p> 2    3    5    7   11<br/>0.0 -1.7 -3.3 -2.3 -0.6</p><p>So the errors in your intervals are</p><p>11:10     11:9     11:8     11:7    11:6</p><p>2.7388   2.7388  -0.5840   1.6731  1.0774</p><p>We disagree on 11:10 and 11:7.  Furthermore, in both cases our disagreement amounts to 18.1834 +/- 0.0001 cents.  Well, 18.1834 cents is the residue you get from closing the cycle of secors at 31 steps.  So it looks like you&apos;ve taken two of the wrong intervals from the 31 note scale.  If you&apos;re following the convention of / for notes, it means you chose a bad tonic.</p><p>&gt;&gt;I find that 41-equal does work in the 9-limit.  Magic is a &gt;&gt;good way of mapping it.  &gt; &gt; Can you give me a specific example, Scala file preferably,<br/>&gt; of 41-equal &quot;magic&quot; mapped?</p><p>A scala file of 41-equal will look the same however it&apos;s mapped.

The generator mapping for magic is &lt;0, 5, 1, 12].  For this scale I take 12 thirds up from the 1/1, and 6 down.  That means you can find approximations to 9/8, 5/4, 3/2, and 7/4 and also 4/3, etc.   But there isn&apos;t an 8/7.

Also you<br/>&gt; steer clear of crap like magic primes. My online scripts only take subset-prime limits.  If you want to use other JI bases you&apos;ll have to download the python libraries.  The regular mapping paradigm doesn&apos;t care either way.</p><p>&gt;&gt;And the result &gt;&gt;partly depends on the approximation to 7:1 being so &gt;&gt;glaringly bad (and all the signs agreeing).<br/>&gt; &gt; Exactly!

This, from wikipedia:</p><p>&quot;The prime limit can be seen as a generalization that does not favor<br/>the number 2. It is defined as the largest prime number in the<br/>factorization of both numerator and denominator. That is, in number<br/>theoretic terms, it measures the smoothness of the numerator and<br/>denominator. The prime limit of the perfect fourth is 3 (the same as<br/>the odd limit), but the minor tone has a prime limit of 5, because 9<br/>can be factorized into 3&times;3, and 10 into 2&times;5.&quot;</p><p>is bogus as far as tuning goes, unless it&apos;s qualified with<br/>exponential limit. Except for numerologists, of course, which<br/>is also fine.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;That&apos;s not what I said. For the specific 11/x series we&apos;re<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;looking at here, the &quot;errors&quot; are of the same sign, and<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;close in size, so the 11/x series is cohesive. In the<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;case of 41, if you play this series without the tonic,<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;it&apos;s damn close to a pure 11/x in sound- against the tonic,<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;the cohesive nature assures character and it doesn&apos;t sound<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;like a bunch of &quot;approximations&quot;. A little high,<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;a little low, a flier... no I would not be happy with that.<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt;You mean they do sound like a bunch of approximations?<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; I don&apos;t know how you get that out of &quot;it doesn&apos;t sound<br/>&gt; &gt; like a bunch of &quot;approximations&quot;.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Unfortunately, so many people use &quot;do&quot; and &quot;don&apos;t&quot;<br/>&gt; interchangeably that you have to guess what they really mean<br/>&gt; from the context.  If you stand by what you wrote, how does<br/>&gt; &quot;damn close&quot; not imply &quot;approximation&quot;?</p><p>Sorry- damn close to an 11/x series. Not approximations of<br/>11/x intervals related to the tonic, but the feel of the series<br/>as a whole. I simply cannot<br/>equate this with &quot;approximations&quot; because of the fact that<br/>I hear intervals with similar characteristics which are not<br/>particularly near to each other, and are even seperated by a<br/>zone which does NOT share the characteristics in mind. For<br/>example, a fifth of around 696 cents is more like a fifth<br/>of 702 cents as far as softness than a fifth of 699 cents is.<br/>If &quot;softness&quot; is a red thread in a particular series of<br/>intervals, that can get us &quot;damn close&quot; in feeling with<br/>quite dubious &quot;approximating&quot;. If you are actually paying<br/>attention to what I say, you&apos;ll see how that apparently<br/>contradicts something else I&apos;ve been saying, but more on<br/>that later.</p><p>&gt; &gt;&gt; From the figures you&apos;ve got there, the worst interval of 46<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt;does not involve the tonic.  And the worst interval from 41<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt;without the tonic is still over 6 cents.  To me, these would<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt;be &quot;fairly large&quot; errors.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; Error from 11/x, in relation to the tonic, yes. Without the<br/>&gt; &gt; tonic, the intervals are centered around a virtual partial<br/>&gt; &gt; some 7+ cents lower than 11. The maximum error is &lt;3.4 cents.<br/>&gt; &gt; In other words, taken on it&apos;s own, this particular series<br/>&gt; &gt; is consistent in proportions with an 11/x series. Against<br/>&gt; &gt; the tonic, it&apos;s consistent with a detuned 11th partial,<br/>&gt; &gt; therefore consistent in character. It&apos;s not great- I just<br/>&gt; &gt; grabbed 41 as an example- but it doesn&apos;t suck.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; This &quot;virtual partial&quot; is similar to the mean implied in<br/>&gt; calculating the standard deviation.  So you seem to agree<br/>&gt; with my logic in using standard deviations to rate errors<br/>&gt; where you don&apos;t temper the octaves.  That&apos;s good because<br/>&gt; nobody else understands it.  Note that if you do optimize<br/>&gt; the octaves, the virtual partial will end up with a near<br/>&gt; zero error.</p><p>That&apos;s great, man! Carl wanted to know my complaints about<br/>the &quot;regular mapping paradigm&quot; and one of them was<br/>the absence, as far as I could tell, of exactly this idea.<br/>&quot;Standard deviations&quot; is good. In my opinion (practice),<br/>series with heavy deviations which have a rhyme and reason<br/>of their own- near-zero in the frame of a tempered octave,<br/>as you put it, or deviating according to partial-oriented<br/>pattern, for example each member of the series &quot;tempered&quot; halfway<br/>toward a member of another interlaced series based on audible<br/>partials, can create both character and consistency, without<br/>what I hear as the spongey character of more-or-less-precisely<br/>approximated low-ratio JI.</p><p>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt;As a benchmark, the worst interval in 11-limit minimax<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt;miracle is 3.3 cents from just.  41-equal is about twice as<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt;bad by the TOP-RMS measure.  And miracle is what I&apos;ll<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt;normally use in the 11-limit.  41 is outside the range I&apos;d<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt;use.  So if the argument is that you lose the 11-limit<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt;character when you reach 41-equal, I&apos;m in agreement.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; Can you give me a specific &quot;minimax&quot; example? 3.3 cents maximum<br/>&gt; &gt; error from a simpler series, even<br/>&gt; &gt; plus or minus, with no fliers, would be very good indeed. But in<br/>&gt; &gt; the Scala archive I find for example:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; You bet it&apos;s good!<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; Canasta with Secor&apos;s minimax generator of 116.7155941 cents (5:9<br/>&gt; &gt; exact). XH5, 1976<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; That&apos;s exactly what I get.  My generator is<br/>&gt; 116.7155940982074 cents.  (May not be accurate to that<br/>&gt; precision.)  I can&apos;t find this file in my Scala archive,<br/>&gt; however, so I can&apos;t check it.  The mapping by octaves and<br/>&gt; generators for miracle is<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &lt;1, 1, 3, 3, 2]<br/>&gt; &lt;0, 6, -7, -2, 15]<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; |<br/>&gt; &gt; Temperings of<br/>&gt; &gt; 11/10       11/9        11/8        11/7        11/6<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; -15.4446     2.7388     -0.5840     -16.5104     1.0774<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; which leaves me scratching my head, for it&apos;s a typical<br/>&gt; &gt; example of &quot;hodge-podge approximations&quot; for this<br/>&gt; &gt; particular 11s series.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; That&apos;s plain wrong.  The errors in primes should be<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;   2    3    5    7   11<br/>&gt; 0.0 -1.7 -3.3 -2.3 -0.6</p><p>Hmmm, what you have there as errors in primes looks like<br/>temperings of the actual partials to me, which is very<br/>groovy, but I was looking at the deviations from the<br/>actual intervals in question. In order to see if we&apos;re<br/>on the same sheet of music here, can you point me to<br/>an explanation of what you mean by errors in primes.</p><p>Er, it would also help if I looked at the right<br/>bunch of numbers, LOL-</p><p>11/10  2.7388<br/>11/9   2.7388<br/>11/8   -0.5840<br/>11/7   1.6731<br/>11/6   1.0774<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; So the errors in your intervals are<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; 11:10     11:9     11:8     11:7    11:6<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; 2.7388   2.7388  -0.5840   1.6731  1.0774</p><p>...as you say. And it certainly<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; We disagree on 11:10 and 11:7.  Furthermore, in both cases<br/>&gt; our disagreement amounts to 18.1834 +/- 0.0001 cents.  Well,<br/>&gt; 18.1834 cents is the residue you get from closing the cycle<br/>&gt; of secors at 31 steps.  So it looks like you&apos;ve taken two of<br/>&gt; the wrong intervals from the 31 note scale.  If you&apos;re<br/>&gt; following the convention of / for notes, it means you chose<br/>&gt; a bad tonic.</p><p>Yip, got that straight now.  Well that&apos;s certainly a<br/>bunch of very very close approximations. And in this<br/>case they certainly qualify as approximations.<br/>Lessee... hmmm, well the Canasta tuning here has done<br/>a fine job with this. It&apos;s harder sounding than the<br/>Just, which isn&apos;t something I can explain for I shouldn&apos;t<br/>be able to hear that, but it&apos;s completely coherent.</p><p>&gt; &gt;&gt;I find that 41-equal does work in the 9-limit.  Magic is a<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt;good way of mapping it.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; Can you give me a specific example, Scala file preferably,<br/>&gt; &gt; of 41-equal &quot;magic&quot; mapped?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; A scala file of 41-equal will look the same however it&apos;s<br/>&gt; mapped.  What I can give you is a 19 note magic scale</p><p>Thanks...<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;    58.9<br/>&gt;   117.9<br/>&gt;   203.5<br/>&gt;   262.5<br/>&gt;   321.4<br/>&gt;   380.4<br/>&gt;   439.3<br/>&gt;   498.2<br/>&gt;   583.9<br/>&gt;   642.8<br/>&gt;   701.8<br/>&gt;   760.7<br/>&gt;   819.6<br/>&gt;   878.6<br/>&gt;   964.2<br/>&gt; 1023.2<br/>&gt; 1082.1<br/>&gt; 1141.1<br/>&gt; 1200.0<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; It uses some optimal tuning or other.  The generator mapping<br/>&gt; for magic is &lt;0, 5, 1, 12].  For this scale I take 12 thirds<br/>&gt; up from the 1/1, and 6 down.  That means you can find<br/>&gt; approximations to 9/8, 5/4, 3/2, and 7/4 and also 4/3, etc.<br/>&gt;   But there isn&apos;t an 8/7.  If you prefer to think utonally,<br/>&gt; try this:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;    58.9<br/>&gt;   117.9<br/>&gt;   176.8<br/>&gt;   235.8<br/>&gt;   321.4<br/>&gt;   380.4<br/>&gt;   439.3<br/>&gt;   498.2<br/>&gt;   557.2<br/>&gt;   616.1<br/>&gt;   701.8<br/>&gt;   760.7<br/>&gt;   819.6<br/>&gt;   878.6<br/>&gt;   937.5<br/>&gt;   996.5<br/>&gt; 1082.1<br/>&gt; 1141.1<br/>&gt; 1200.0</p><p>These are both very good. I notice in the second one,<br/>which is the first &quot;tuning-group&quot; tuning I&apos;ve heard<br/>that I could actually use (different strokes, etc.) other<br/>than some of Kraig&apos;s tunings and couple of George&apos;s<br/>and Margo&apos;s (and man, I&apos;ve plowed through the archives<br/>for a year, are you guys aware of the shear bulk of stuff<br/>you churn out?) the &quot;secor&quot; is a little high. When I got<br/>up at 4 this morning to get in a couple of hours of<br/>monkeying with the secor, I found that tweaking it a<br/>little high or a little low of its ideal value creates<br/>tunings that sound more &quot;as one&quot; to me. So they&apos;re actually<br/>lumpier and worse, on paper, by anybody&apos;s standards, but I<br/>like them better.</p><p>I cannot explain why this is. It seems to me that the secor<br/>generator is hypersensitive, as far as the overall character<br/>of the tunings generated. Which is cool.</p><p>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt;And the 11/x series without the<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt;tonic is really the 9-limit.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; Yes, you&apos;ve got the superparticulars expanding from 10/9.<br/>&gt; &gt; Surely you see one reason I&apos;m concerned with consistency<br/>&gt; &gt; in the series itself, not just absolute proximity to<br/>&gt; &gt; the Just intervals themselves?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Um, what&apos;s the difference?</p><p>See above, &quot;standard deviation&quot;.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt;Whether your aim is to look at higher limits with no sevens,<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt;or only to split the differences within lower limits, it<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt;doesn&apos;t matter.  The result is the same.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; More or less, but as far as audibility, I think it&apos;s better<br/>&gt; &gt; to go for harmonic means of audible partials rather than<br/>&gt; &gt; ratios based on partials of dubious audibility. Also you<br/>&gt; &gt; steer clear of crap like magic primes.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; My online scripts only take subset-prime limits.  If you<br/>&gt; want to use other JI bases you&apos;ll have to download the<br/>&gt; python libraries.  The regular mapping paradigm doesn&apos;t care<br/>&gt; either way.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt;And the result<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt;partly depends on the approximation to 7:1 being so<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt;glaringly bad (and all the signs agreeing).<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; Exactly! Vice into virtue. I&apos;d rather have rock-solid<br/>&gt; &gt; higher-partials/more-complex series in a tuning than<br/>&gt; &gt; lumpy references to the lowest partials. Easier to<br/>&gt; &gt; sing, to cut to the chase.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Have you seen George Secor&apos;s paper about his 17 note well<br/>&gt; temperament?  It&apos;s based on an incomplete prime limit.</p><p>Certainly- as I&apos;ve mentioned a number of times before, hunting out<br/>17 by ear is brought me to this list in the first place.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;Well, I just don&apos;t buy brute dissonance as a measure of<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;a tuning&apos;s validity at all, nor do I find that brute<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;dissonance agrees very much with contextual (musical)<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;dissonance and consonance. But different strokes...<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt;I&apos;m happy that tension and release works in 12-equal with<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt;5-limit rules.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; Doesn&apos;t work for me- I hear neither true tension nor true<br/>&gt; &gt; release in 12-equal, and haven&apos;t since earliest memory. I<br/>&gt; &gt; remember cringing when I first heard in school that the M3<br/>&gt; &gt; was &quot;happy&quot; and &quot;peaceful&quot;. What, that theatrical grimace<br/>&gt; &gt; is supposed to be a smile?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I wasn&apos;t talking about the tuning but music written in it.<br/>&gt; Many, many people learn music theory in 12-equal and it<br/>&gt; makes perfect sense to them.</p><p>I also learned music theory in 12-equal and cringed all the<br/>way through.</p><p>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt;And the approximation is quite extreme<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt;there.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; It&apos;s not an approximation. Different interval.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I see you&apos;re having difficulty with the meanings of words again.</p><p>If &quot;to approximate&quot; means &quot;to create an object A, which<br/>bears little resemblance to object B, then to insist that<br/>object A resembles object B, for unfathomable reasons&quot;, then yes,<br/>I have difficulty with that meaning.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt;The thirds in 12-equal don&apos;t sound at all like their<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt;just counterparts.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; They sound quite a bit like 81/64 to me.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; They&apos;re nearly 8 cents out, so you&apos;re still being generous<br/>&gt; with the approximations.</p><p>Sure, but the relationship of an M3 to the fifth is<br/>important- 81/64 pops right out of perfect fifths, and<br/>400 cents right out of near-perfect fifths. Not a great<br/>approximation, but compared to 5/4 vs 400 cents, gimmee<br/>a break. The &quot;5/4&quot; being unlinked to the fifths<br/>is a point of complaint about 34, btw.</p><p>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt;I&apos;m also generally happy with 11-limit harmony in miracle.<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt;Although I&apos;m recently finding that I prefer the<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt;approximation to 11:8 to that of 7:5.

(Serious question).<br/>&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt;Ratios of odd numbers no greater than 11 and their octave &gt;&gt;equivalents.<br/>&gt; &gt; Okay, that&apos;s cool by me, because it relates to actual audible<br/>&gt; partials. This, from wikipedia:</p><p>... which does also define the odd limit.</p><p>&gt; &quot;The prime limit can be seen as a generalization that does not favor &gt; the number 2. It is defined as the largest prime number in the &gt; factorization of both numerator and denominator. That is, in number &gt; theoretic terms, it measures the smoothness of the numerator and &gt; denominator. The prime limit of the perfect fourth is 3 (the same as &gt; the odd limit), but the minor tone has a prime limit of 5, because 9 &gt; can be factorized into 3&iuml;&iquest;&half;3, and 10 into 2&iuml;&iquest;&half;5.&quot;<br/>&gt; &gt; is bogus as far as tuning goes, unless it&apos;s qualified with &gt; exponential limit. Except for numerologists, of course, which<br/>&gt; is also fine. Ah, now ... Weighted prime limits are the current fashion for rating temperaments.  You have my PDF on them.  The important thing is the weighting, which can be thought of statistically as saying how likely an interval is to be used.</p><p>Prime limits are obviously not perfect because you have to choose an arbitrary subset instead of setting a weighting over all intervals.  But neither do you choose exactly which intervals you&apos;re interested in.  Choosing certain primes and weighting them falls between two stools, but it&apos;s simple and works well enough.</p><p>&gt; Sorry- damn close to an 11/x series. Not approximations of<br/>&gt; 11/x intervals related to the tonic, but the feel of the series &gt; as a whole. I simply cannot<br/>&gt; equate this with &quot;approximations&quot; because of the fact that<br/>&gt; I hear intervals with similar characteristics which are not<br/>&gt; particularly near to each other, and are even seperated by a<br/>&gt; zone which does NOT share the characteristics in mind. For &gt; example, a fifth of around 696 cents is more like a fifth<br/>&gt; of 702 cents as far as softness than a fifth of 699 cents is.<br/>&gt; If &quot;softness&quot; is a red thread in a particular series of<br/>&gt; intervals, that can get us &quot;damn close&quot; in feeling with<br/>&gt; quite dubious &quot;approximating&quot;. If you are actually paying<br/>&gt; attention to what I say, you&apos;ll see how that apparently<br/>&gt; contradicts something else I&apos;ve been saying, but more on<br/>&gt; that later. This is where you have to set out your ideas in detail. Maybe there&apos;s a way we can make use of them.  I won&apos;t promise anything because it sounds like the pitch-dimension gets too fragmented.  But even then maybe better mathematicians can do something with it.</p><p>&gt; That&apos;s great, man! Carl wanted to know my complaints about<br/>&gt; the &quot;regular mapping paradigm&quot; and one of them was &gt; the absence, as far as I could tell, of exactly this idea.<br/>&gt; &quot;Standard deviations&quot; is good. In my opinion (practice),<br/>&gt; series with heavy deviations which have a rhyme and reason &gt; of their own- near-zero in the frame of a tempered octave,<br/>&gt; as you put it, or deviating according to partial-oriented &gt; pattern, for example each member of the series &quot;tempered&quot; halfway &gt; toward a member of another interlaced series based on audible<br/>&gt; partials, can create both character and consistency, without &gt; what I hear as the spongey character of more-or-less-precisely<br/>&gt; approximated low-ratio JI.</p><p>A paradigm doesn&apos;t stand or fall by how you measure the errors.  Still, we have been thinking about errors over the years.</p><p>The first step was to look at complete odd limits.  Paul Erlich defined &quot;consistency&quot; to ensure the errors added up correctly.  His 22 note paper shows this thinking.  This is also why we started looking at the mappings -- to ensure that the errors add up right when you don&apos;t have a consistent ET.</p><p>The second step was TOP errors.  These are what Paul uses in the Middle Path paper.  You take the worst weighted error over a prime limit.  If you use the right weighting and optimize the scale stretch, it turns out that it doesn&apos;t matter much which intervals you look at.  The primes themselves are a sufficient subset.  Because of that I redefined &quot;TOP&quot; to be more general so that what Paul used is &quot;TOP-max&quot;.</p><p>The third step is to use standard deviations where you don&apos;t optimize the scale stretches.  I started writing that PDF to explain why this works, and also why TOP works.  Ultimately, we know they&apos;re both wrong.  Worst or average weighted errors don&apos;t work unless you optimize the scale stretch. Standard deviations don&apos;t work if you shrink the scales. But still, they&apos;re simple, and work well enough to get useful results.</p><p>&gt;&gt;That&apos;s plain wrong.  The errors in primes should be<br/>&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt;  2    3    5    7   11<br/>&gt;&gt;0.0 -1.7 -3.3 -2.3 -0.6<br/>&gt; &gt; Hmmm, what you have there as errors in primes looks like<br/>&gt; temperings of the actual partials to me, which is very<br/>&gt; groovy, but I was looking at the deviations from the<br/>&gt; actual intervals in question. In order to see if we&apos;re<br/>&gt; on the same sheet of music here, can you point me to<br/>&gt; an explanation of what you mean by errors in primes.</p><p>Yes.  Every composite number is built from prime numbers, and every interval in a regular tuning is built from prime intervals.  If they&apos;re mapped from an ideal, not only can you get the size of an interval from the size of the primes, but you can also get the error in a composite interval from the errors of the primes that make it up.</p><p>&gt; Er, it would also help if I looked at the right<br/>&gt; bunch of numbers, LOL-<br/>&gt; &gt; 11/10  2.7388      &gt; 11/9   2.7388     &gt; 11/8   -0.5840      &gt; 11/7   1.6731      &gt; 11/6   1.0774</p><p>11/10 is like 11/5, so take the difference between the errors in 11 and 5.  -0.6+3.3=2.7.  And so on.</p><p>&gt;&gt;We disagree on 11:10 and 11:7.  Furthermore, in both cases &gt;&gt;our disagreement amounts to 18.1834 +/- 0.0001 cents.  Well, &gt;&gt;18.1834 cents is the residue you get from closing the cycle &gt;&gt;of secors at 31 steps.  So it looks like you&apos;ve taken two of &gt;&gt;the wrong intervals from the 31 note scale.  If you&apos;re &gt;&gt;following the convention of / for notes, it means you chose &gt;&gt;a bad tonic.<br/>&gt; &gt; Yip, got that straight now.  Well that&apos;s certainly a &gt; bunch of very very close approximations. And in this<br/>&gt; case they certainly qualify as approximations.<br/>&gt; Lessee... hmmm, well the Canasta tuning here has done<br/>&gt; a fine job with this. It&apos;s harder sounding than the<br/>&gt; Just, which isn&apos;t something I can explain for I shouldn&apos;t<br/>&gt; be able to hear that, but it&apos;s completely coherent. The tuning is 11-limit minimax miracle.  Canasta is the scale -- 31 generators.</p><p>&gt; These are both very good. I notice in the second one,<br/>&gt; which is the first &quot;tuning-group&quot; tuning I&apos;ve heard<br/>&gt; that I could actually use (different strokes, etc.) other<br/>&gt; than some of Kraig&apos;s tunings and couple of George&apos;s<br/>&gt; and Margo&apos;s (and man, I&apos;ve plowed through the archives<br/>&gt; for a year, are you guys aware of the shear bulk of stuff<br/>&gt; you churn out?) the &quot;secor&quot; is a little high. When I got<br/>&gt; up at 4 this morning to get in a couple of hours of<br/>&gt; monkeying with the secor, I found that tweaking it a &gt; little high or a little low of its ideal value creates<br/>&gt; tunings that sound more &quot;as one&quot; to me. So they&apos;re actually<br/>&gt; lumpier and worse, on paper, by anybody&apos;s standards, but I &gt; like them better. Those are magic tunings, so the generator is a major third, not a secor.  Secors are for miracle (because George Secor was the first person to descover the temperament class).  So which generator are you tweaking?</p><p>I don&apos;t know how useful the archives are precisely because there&apos;s so much in there.  Taking part is better (as you&apos;re now doing of course).  I found some posts from Margo very useful from several years ago but I don&apos;t know if you&apos;ll get back to them.  There are more permanent documents which you&apos;re finding but *cough* could maybe study in more detail.</p><p>&gt; I cannot explain why this is. It seems to me that the secor &gt; generator is hypersensitive, as far as the overall character &gt; of the tunings generated. Which is cool. A small change in the generator gets magnified in the more complex intervals.  And this is more important the better the approximations are to start with.  So this makes sense, whichever temperament class it is you&apos;re talking about.</p><p>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;And the 11/x series without the &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;tonic is really the 9-limit.  &gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt;Yes, you&apos;ve got the superparticulars expanding from 10/9.<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt;Surely you see one reason I&apos;m concerned with consistency<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt;in the series itself, not just absolute proximity to<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt;the Just intervals themselves? &gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt;Um, what&apos;s the difference?<br/>&gt; &gt; See above, &quot;standard deviation&quot;.</p><p>It means scoring intervals between partials instead of only the partials measured relative to the fundamental.  But intervals either way.</p><p>&gt;&gt;Have you seen George Secor&apos;s paper about his 17 note well &gt;&gt;temperament?  It&apos;s based on an incomplete prime limit.<br/>&gt; &gt; Certainly- as I&apos;ve mentioned a number of times before, hunting out<br/>&gt; 17 by ear is brought me to this list in the first place.</p><p>It&apos;s sort of on the edge of the regular mapping paradigm. Well temperaments follow mappings but aren&apos;t determined by them.</p><p>&gt; I also learned music theory in 12-equal and cringed all the &gt; way through. One thing I&apos;ll say is that sus4 chords aren&apos;t as bad as they should be.</p><p>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;The thirds in 12-equal don&apos;t sound at all like their &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;just counterparts. &gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt;They sound quite a bit like 81/64 to me.<br/>&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt;They&apos;re nearly 8 cents out, so you&apos;re still being generous &gt;&gt;with the approximations.<br/>&gt; &gt; Sure, but the relationship of an M3 to the fifth is &gt; important- 81/64 pops right out of perfect fifths, and<br/>&gt; 400 cents right out of near-perfect fifths. Not a great<br/>&gt; approximation, but compared to 5/4 vs 400 cents, gimmee<br/>&gt; a break. The &quot;5/4&quot; being unlinked to the fifths<br/>&gt; is a point of complaint about 34, btw. We were talking about the LucyTuned third before.  It gets closer to 5:4 than 400 cents gets to 81:64.</p><p>As it happens, the miracle tempered approximation to 81:64 comes out close to 400 cents.  Exactly so if you tune to 72-equal.  And there&apos;s also the approximate 5:4 to compare it with.</p><p>Is that unlinking something you complain about?</p><p>                         Graham</p></div><h3><a id=73728 href="#73728">ðŸ”—</a>Carl Lumma &#x3C;carl@lumma.org&#x3E;</h3><span>10/4/2007 9:53:18 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>&gt; &gt; &gt; What do you mean by &quot;11-limit&quot;?

Why do you have to get<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt;confrontational about it?<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; Where do you get &quot;confrontational&quot;?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Is this the answering a question with another question game?</p><p>I don&apos;t know- is it? Hahaha! Nah, Carl is the indisputed<br/>master of that game. If you look closely at your &quot;question&quot;,<br/>you&apos;ll find that it is actually a statement. Consider<br/>the classic example: &quot;Have you stopped beating your<br/>wife, yes or no?&quot;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;What do you mean by &quot;11-limit&quot;? (Serious question).<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt;Ratios of odd numbers no greater than 11 and their octave<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt;equivalents.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; Okay, that&apos;s cool by me, because it relates to actual audible<br/>&gt; &gt; partials. This, from wikipedia:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; ... which does also define the odd limit.</p><p>The limit I use is &quot;highest partial referred to&quot;.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &quot;The prime limit can be seen as a generalization that does not<br/>favor<br/>&gt; &gt; the number 2. It is defined as the largest prime number in the<br/>&gt; &gt; factorization of both numerator and denominator. That is, in<br/>number<br/>&gt; &gt; theoretic terms, it measures the smoothness of the numerator and<br/>&gt; &gt; denominator. The prime limit of the perfect fourth is 3 (the<br/>same as<br/>&gt; &gt; the odd limit), but the minor tone has a prime limit of 5,<br/>because 9<br/>&gt; &gt; can be factorized into 3&times;3, and 10 into 2&times;5.&quot;<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; is bogus as far as tuning goes, unless it&apos;s qualified with<br/>&gt; &gt; exponential limit. Except for numerologists, of course, which<br/>&gt; &gt; is also fine.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Ah, now ... Weighted prime limits are the current fashion<br/>&gt; for rating temperaments.  You have my PDF on them.  The<br/>&gt; important thing is the weighting, which can be thought of<br/>&gt; statistically as saying how likely an interval is to be used.</p><p>I have yet to find any concrete connection between this and the<br/>audible, but we&apos;ll see.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Prime limits are obviously not perfect because you have to<br/>&gt; choose an arbitrary subset instead of setting a weighting<br/>&gt; over all intervals.  But neither do you choose exactly which<br/>&gt; intervals you&apos;re interested in.  Choosing certain primes and<br/>&gt; weighting them falls between two stools, but it&apos;s simple and<br/>&gt; works well enough.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; Sorry- damn close to an 11/x series. Not approximations of<br/>&gt; &gt; 11/x intervals related to the tonic, but the feel of the series<br/>&gt; &gt; as a whole. I simply cannot<br/>&gt; &gt; equate this with &quot;approximations&quot; because of the fact that<br/>&gt; &gt; I hear intervals with similar characteristics which are not<br/>&gt; &gt; particularly near to each other, and are even seperated by a<br/>&gt; &gt; zone which does NOT share the characteristics in mind. For<br/>&gt; &gt; example, a fifth of around 696 cents is more like a fifth<br/>&gt; &gt; of 702 cents as far as softness than a fifth of 699 cents is.<br/>&gt; &gt; If &quot;softness&quot; is a red thread in a particular series of<br/>&gt; &gt; intervals, that can get us &quot;damn close&quot; in feeling with<br/>&gt; &gt; quite dubious &quot;approximating&quot;. If you are actually paying<br/>&gt; &gt; attention to what I say, you&apos;ll see how that apparently<br/>&gt; &gt; contradicts something else I&apos;ve been saying, but more on<br/>&gt; &gt; that later.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; This is where you have to set out your ideas in detail.<br/>&gt; Maybe there&apos;s a way we can make use of them.  I won&apos;t<br/>&gt; promise anything because it sounds like the pitch-dimension<br/>&gt; gets too fragmented.  But even then maybe better<br/>&gt; mathematicians can do something with it.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; That&apos;s great, man! Carl wanted to know my complaints about<br/>&gt; &gt; the &quot;regular mapping paradigm&quot; and one of them was<br/>&gt; &gt; the absence, as far as I could tell, of exactly this idea.<br/>&gt; &gt; &quot;Standard deviations&quot; is good. In my opinion (practice),<br/>&gt; &gt; series with heavy deviations which have a rhyme and reason<br/>&gt; &gt; of their own- near-zero in the frame of a tempered octave,<br/>&gt; &gt; as you put it, or deviating according to partial-oriented<br/>&gt; &gt; pattern, for example each member of the series &quot;tempered&quot;<br/>halfway<br/>&gt; &gt; toward a member of another interlaced series based on audible<br/>&gt; &gt; partials, can create both character and consistency, without<br/>&gt; &gt; what I hear as the spongey character of more-or-less-precisely<br/>&gt; &gt; approximated low-ratio JI.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; A paradigm doesn&apos;t stand or fall by how you measure the<br/>&gt; errors.</p><p>Well I think measuring &quot;errors&quot; by ear is a pretty good<br/>ruler.</p><p>&gt;Still, we have been thinking about errors over the<br/>&gt; years.</p><p>Yes. It seems to me that once you&apos;ve got a certain amount<br/>of deviation from whatever model, it&apos;s time to ask whether<br/>you&apos;re &quot;approximating&quot; or actually measuring something else.<br/>I read about dinosaurs with my little boy- it&apos;s interesting<br/>when the books mention reclassifications and new<br/>descriptions of dinosaurs (lots of revision in the last<br/>25 years or so).<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; The first step was to look at complete odd limits.  Paul<br/>&gt; Erlich defined &quot;consistency&quot; to ensure the errors added up<br/>&gt; correctly.  His 22 note paper shows this thinking.  This is<br/>&gt; also why we started looking at the mappings -- to ensure<br/>&gt; that the errors add up right when you don&apos;t have a<br/>&gt; consistent ET.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; The second step was TOP errors.  These are what Paul uses in<br/>&gt; the Middle Path paper.  You take the worst weighted error<br/>&gt; over a prime limit.  If you use the right weighting and<br/>&gt; optimize the scale stretch, it turns out that it doesn&apos;t<br/>&gt; matter much which intervals you look at.  The primes<br/>&gt; themselves are a sufficient subset.  Because of that I<br/>&gt; redefined &quot;TOP&quot; to be more general so that what Paul used is<br/>&gt; &quot;TOP-max&quot;.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; The third step is to use standard deviations where you don&apos;t<br/>&gt; optimize the scale stretches.  I started writing that PDF to<br/>&gt; explain why this works, and also why TOP works.  Ultimately,<br/>&gt; we know they&apos;re both wrong.  Worst or average weighted<br/>&gt; errors don&apos;t work unless you optimize the scale stretch.<br/>&gt; Standard deviations don&apos;t work if you shrink the scales.<br/>&gt; But still, they&apos;re simple, and work well enough to get<br/>&gt; useful results.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt;That&apos;s plain wrong.  The errors in primes should be<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt;  2    3    5    7   11<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt;0.0 -1.7 -3.3 -2.3 -0.6<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; Hmmm, what you have there as errors in primes looks like<br/>&gt; &gt; temperings of the actual partials to me, which is very<br/>&gt; &gt; groovy, but I was looking at the deviations from the<br/>&gt; &gt; actual intervals in question. In order to see if we&apos;re<br/>&gt; &gt; on the same sheet of music here, can you point me to<br/>&gt; &gt; an explanation of what you mean by errors in primes.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Yes.  Every composite number is built from prime numbers,<br/>&gt; and every interval in a regular tuning is built from prime<br/>&gt; intervals.  If they&apos;re mapped from an ideal, not only can<br/>&gt; you get the size of an interval from the size of the primes,<br/>&gt; but you can also get the error in a composite interval from<br/>&gt; the errors of the primes that make it up.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; Er, it would also help if I looked at the right<br/>&gt; &gt; bunch of numbers, LOL-<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; 11/10  2.7388<br/>&gt; &gt; 11/9   2.7388<br/>&gt; &gt; 11/8   -0.5840<br/>&gt; &gt; 11/7   1.6731<br/>&gt; &gt; 11/6   1.0774<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; 11/10 is like 11/5, so take the difference between the<br/>&gt; errors in 11 and 5.  -0.6+3.3=2.7.  And so on.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt;We disagree on 11:10 and 11:7.  Furthermore, in both cases<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt;our disagreement amounts to 18.1834 +/- 0.0001 cents.  Well,<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt;18.1834 cents is the residue you get from closing the cycle<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt;of secors at 31 steps.  So it looks like you&apos;ve taken two of<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt;the wrong intervals from the 31 note scale.  If you&apos;re<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt;following the convention of / for notes, it means you chose<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt;a bad tonic.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; Yip, got that straight now.  Well that&apos;s certainly a<br/>&gt; &gt; bunch of very very close approximations. And in this<br/>&gt; &gt; case they certainly qualify as approximations.<br/>&gt; &gt; Lessee... hmmm, well the Canasta tuning here has done<br/>&gt; &gt; a fine job with this. It&apos;s harder sounding than the<br/>&gt; &gt; Just, which isn&apos;t something I can explain for I shouldn&apos;t<br/>&gt; &gt; be able to hear that, but it&apos;s completely coherent.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; The tuning is 11-limit minimax miracle.  Canasta is the<br/>&gt; scale -- 31 generators.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; These are both very good. I notice in the second one,<br/>&gt; &gt; which is the first &quot;tuning-group&quot; tuning I&apos;ve heard<br/>&gt; &gt; that I could actually use (different strokes, etc.) other<br/>&gt; &gt; than some of Kraig&apos;s tunings and couple of George&apos;s<br/>&gt; &gt; and Margo&apos;s (and man, I&apos;ve plowed through the archives<br/>&gt; &gt; for a year, are you guys aware of the shear bulk of stuff<br/>&gt; &gt; you churn out?) the &quot;secor&quot; is a little high. When I got<br/>&gt; &gt; up at 4 this morning to get in a couple of hours of<br/>&gt; &gt; monkeying with the secor, I found that tweaking it a<br/>&gt; &gt; little high or a little low of its ideal value creates<br/>&gt; &gt; tunings that sound more &quot;as one&quot; to me. So they&apos;re actually<br/>&gt; &gt; lumpier and worse, on paper, by anybody&apos;s standards, but I<br/>&gt; &gt; like them better.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Those are magic tunings, so the generator is a major third,<br/>&gt; not a secor.  Secors are for miracle (because George Secor<br/>&gt; was the first person to descover the temperament class).  So<br/>&gt; which generator are you tweaking?</p><p>The secor, so I guess I&apos;m only talking about &quot;miracle&quot; tunings.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I don&apos;t know how useful the archives are precisely because<br/>&gt; there&apos;s so much in there.  Taking part is better (as you&apos;re<br/>&gt; now doing of course).  I found some posts from Margo very<br/>&gt; useful from several years ago but I don&apos;t know if you&apos;ll get<br/>&gt; back to them.  There are more permanent documents which<br/>&gt; you&apos;re finding but *cough* could maybe study in more detail.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; I cannot explain why this is. It seems to me that the secor<br/>&gt; &gt; generator is hypersensitive, as far as the overall character<br/>&gt; &gt; of the tunings generated. Which is cool.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; A small change in the generator gets magnified in the more<br/>&gt; complex intervals.  And this is more important the better<br/>&gt; the approximations are to start with.  So this makes sense,<br/>&gt; whichever temperament class it is you&apos;re talking about.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;And the 11/x series without the<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;tonic is really the 9-limit.<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;Yes, you&apos;ve got the superparticulars expanding from 10/9.<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;Surely you see one reason I&apos;m concerned with consistency<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;in the series itself, not just absolute proximity to<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;the Just intervals themselves?<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt;Um, what&apos;s the difference?<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; See above, &quot;standard deviation&quot;.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; It means scoring intervals between partials instead of only<br/>&gt; the partials measured relative to the fundamental.  But<br/>&gt; intervals either way.</p><p>But when you&apos;re scoring intervals &quot;between partials&quot; you&apos;re<br/>not approximating intervals derived directly from the<br/>partials (in relation to the tonic). Losing the idea that<br/>these are approximations and treating them as something new<br/>is something I&apos;m &quot;advocating&quot;. Go ahead and make them<br/>&quot;worse&quot; as far as intervals above a tonic, but better<br/>on their own terms.

Not a great<br/>&gt; &gt; approximation, but compared to 5/4 vs 400 cents, gimmee<br/>&gt; &gt; a break.

If approximating JI either fails,<br/>&gt; or succeeds too well (using a bazillion intervals almost<br/>&gt; indistinguishable from JI, why not just use a bazillion actual<br/>&gt; JI intervals?), then it seems utterly reasonable (not to &gt; mention musically good) to work on the attractiveness, &gt; usability and coherency/integrity of intervals that are NOT<br/>&gt; &quot;JI&quot; Or you could look for temperament classes with middling-low errors and low complexity.

(Unless you get silly about the octave stretch.)</p><p>&gt; Also, IMO, it is imperative to address issues like &gt; tetrachordal/scalar harmony and harmonic-series harmony,<br/>&gt; for what is perfect in one can be a disaster in others. &gt; This issue can be described in shorthand as the 7/4 &quot;vs&quot; 9/5 &gt; issue. How do you address that?</p><p>&gt; There is no way, absolutely no way, that I&apos;m the first or only &gt; to say &quot;lets make virtues from vices&quot; on this tuning list. &gt; It should also be obvious that I&apos;m advocating the<br/>&gt; preservation of JI by not watering it down. Not everyone<br/>&gt; may agree with the idea of let just be just and not-just be<br/>&gt; not-just, avoiding neither-fish-nor-fowl.</p><p>It isn&apos;t obvious because you dart around saying this and that and not getting to the point.

If approximating JI either fails,<br/>&gt; or succeeds too well (using a bazillion intervals almost<br/>&gt; indistinguishable from JI, why not just use a bazillion actual<br/>&gt; JI intervals?), then it seems utterly reasonable (not to<br/>&gt; mention musically good) to work on the attractiveness,<br/>&gt; usability and coherency/integrity of intervals that are NOT<br/>&gt; &quot;JI&quot;</p><p>???</p><p>&gt; This can be done without dumping JI or ignoring the actual<br/>&gt; source of JI, which is the harmonic partials. Pretending the<br/>&gt; harmonic series doesn&apos;t exist or matter would be even more<br/>&gt; bogus, by far, than deifying JI. What would be very nice,<br/>&gt; I believe, are intervals which are not simple JI but function<br/>&gt; well in terms of the audible partials.</p><p>Such as....</p><p>&gt; One way of doing this is already done in practice here-<br/>&gt; splitting the difference between 7/4 and 9/5 for example<br/>&gt; works functionally and, to my ears, in terms of physical<br/>&gt; sound.</p><p>Sounds like you&apos;re recommending 12-ET!</p><p>&gt; One reason I keep harping on about 400 cents vs. 5/4 is that<br/>&gt; 400 cents is actually an example of what I&apos;m talking about.<br/>&gt; It splits the difference, not tragically badly, between 5/4<br/>&gt; and 9/7 and in flexibly pitched music it can be tweaked on<br/>&gt; the fly to work as either (leading tone, sing high! I&apos;m sure<br/>&gt; others have heard similiar instructions) as well as a<br/>&gt; product-of-fifths Pyth. 3d. The one-dimensional interpretation<br/>&gt; as 400-cents as 5/4 bugs me not just because it can make me<br/>&gt; cringe on fixed-pitch instruments, but because it hampers<br/>&gt; thoughts on these &quot;other families&quot; of intervals.</p><p>Where has anybody said it can&apos;t also function as 9:7?</p><p>&gt; Another way</p><p>...to &quot;suggest&quot; how to improve the regular mapping<br/>paradigm is...</p><p>&gt; is examining heavy &quot;temperings&quot; in terms of<br/>&gt; what Graham calls &quot;standard deviation&quot;. And so on. Any<br/>&gt; approach requires losing &quot;near simple JI good, far from simple<br/>&gt; JI bad&quot; of course. And seriously unhooking concordance from<br/>&gt; consonance.</p><p>[At this point, blood starts pouring out of reader&apos;s nose.]</p><p>&gt; Also, IMO, it is imperative to address issues like<br/>&gt; tetrachordal/scalar harmony and harmonic-series harmony,<br/>&gt; for what is perfect in one can be a disaster in others.<br/>&gt; This issue can be described in shorthand as the 7/4 &quot;vs&quot; 9/5<br/>&gt; issue.</p><p>Lots of scale theory has been done around here.

It seems to me that once you&apos;ve got a certain amount<br/>&gt; of deviation from whatever model, it&apos;s time to ask whether<br/>&gt; you&apos;re &quot;approximating&quot; or actually measuring something else.<br/>&gt; I read about dinosaurs with my little boy- it&apos;s interesting<br/>&gt; when the books mention reclassifications and new<br/>&gt; descriptions of dinosaurs (lots of revision in the last<br/>&gt; 25 years or so).</p><p>&apos;Approximations&apos; in music will be subservient to musical context<br/>and the musical background of the listener.</p><p>&gt; But when you&apos;re scoring intervals &quot;between partials&quot; you&apos;re<br/>&gt; not approximating intervals derived directly from the<br/>&gt; partials (in relation to the tonic). Losing the idea that<br/>&gt; these are approximations and treating them as something new<br/>&gt; is something I&apos;m &quot;advocating&quot;.</p><p>If you want to advocate something, you should be able to<br/>give an example.
