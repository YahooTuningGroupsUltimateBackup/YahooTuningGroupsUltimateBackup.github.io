These days, i always sign in whenever<br/>i edit a (non-tuning) Wikipedia page. But in the past,<br/>when i inadvertently did an edit without signing in,<br/>if i happened to include any reference to my webpages,<br/>it was tracked anyway. So now, even if i edit anonymously,<br/>Wikipedia still knows that my ISP address is the one that&apos;s<br/>connected to adding links to <a href="http://tonalsoft.com">tonalsoft.com</a>. So i just don&apos;t<br/>bother anymore.</p><p>Of course i think it would be nice to have external links<br/>on Wikipedia pages about tuning which point to my own website,<br/>if only because Wikipedia readers could then get a lot<br/>more relevant information from my webpages. But i certainly<br/>will not add them.</p><p>And thanks (he said sarcastically) to Carl Lumma for removing<br/>the link to my website that *was* on the Wikipedia 41-et page.<br/>What&apos;s up with that? 41-edo is certainly a member of the<br/>miracle family of temperaments, and that link pointed to my<br/>page about miracle ... and *i* didn&apos;t add it to Wikipedia,<br/>someone else did.</p><p>-monz<br/><a href="http://tonalsoft.com/tonescape.aspx">http://tonalsoft.com/tonescape.aspx</a><br/>Tonescape microtonal music software</p></div><h3>monz &#x3C;joemonz@yahoo.com&#x3E;</h3><span>3/11/2008 10:34:11 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;Keenan Pepper&quot; &lt;keenanpepper@...&gt; wrote:</p><p>&gt; &lt;snip&gt; Also, I have no idea what the<br/>&gt; scare quotes around &quot;editors&quot; are supposed to mean.
