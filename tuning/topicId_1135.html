If you<br/>take a<br/>&gt;two-step interval from Wendy Carlos&apos; alpha scale, for instance, I&apos;d<br/>prefer<br/>&gt;to call it half a minor third than an approximation to 12/11. Some<br/>pelog<br/>&gt;scales have an interval size that has a similar impression to my ear,<br/>&gt;splitting a (roughly) minor third into two parts that are (roughly)<br/>similar<br/>&gt;in size. I&apos;m not sure that it matters much whether it is closer to<br/>11/10,<br/>&gt;12/11, or 13/12, or somewhere in between. In general, my feeling is<br/>that<br/>&gt;the pattern of small and large steps is more relevant to the character<br/>of a<br/>&gt;pelog scale than the integer ratios that approximate those steps.<br/>&gt;Blackwood&apos;s faux pelog in his 23-note etude is still recognizable as a<br/>&gt;pelog scale. Similarly, the roughly equal size of the steps of a<br/>slendro<br/>&gt;scale is what gives it its distinctive character.</p><p>I totally agree! Look at Arabic scales, like 3 3 4 4 3 3 4 in 24-tET,<br/>for a more familiar example of a minor third being cut in half.</p><p>Roughly speaking, low integer ratios matter only when the tones are<br/>being used simulataneously in harmony, and when some sort of &quot;blending&quot;<br/>is the goal. A major exception is that the 2:1 and 3:2 (and 4:3) are<br/>powerful enough that even purely melodic scales tend to have structures<br/>that repeat themselves at these intervals.</p></div>
