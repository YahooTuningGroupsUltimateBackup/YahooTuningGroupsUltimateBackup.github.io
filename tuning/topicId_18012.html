We&apos;ve had quite a lot of discussion on this list about<br/>&gt; consonance/dissonance measures and much has been said that would be directly<br/>&gt; relevant to his models, but no one has presented an explanation of how they<br/>&gt; are derived.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; -Paul</p><p>Paul-</p><p>Clarence Barlow basically wrote two important publications concerning the<br/>derivation of his theory of tonality.<br/>A 124-page article (&quot;Bus Journey to Parametron&quot;) published in 1981 in the<br/>Cologne Feedback Paper series, and a shorter article (&quot;Two essays on<br/>Theory&quot;) which was printed in one of the 1987 issues of the Computer Music<br/>Journal.<br/>In his very amusing Bus Journey, Barlow makes the assumption that the<br/>&quot;harmonicity&quot; of an interval is related to the divisibility of the numbers<br/>involved in the frequency ratio.<br/>(He observed that this might be related with our mental ability to divide<br/>circles such as a pizza in a given number of segments, equal in size. When<br/>asked to give an order of how easily one can cut the circle in 2 to 9<br/>segment, his friends gave orders which were surprisingly consistent.<br/>Interestingly, the famous cognitive psychologist Roger Shepard conducted<br/>research on mental complexity of numbers with similar results in the<br/>mid-70s.</p><p>Hence, Barlow&apos;s (scientifically unproven, but irrefutable) assumption that<br/>an analogous mechanism also determines the<br/>harmonicity/consonance/concordance of an interval, and the &quot;metrical<br/>affinity&quot; of simultaneous meters. He looked for existing theories and found<br/>that Euler&apos;s &quot;gradus&quot; function gave a pretty good approximation of the<br/>divisibility problem but with a fundamental shortfall.</p><p>Barlow: &quot;Those epitomes of indivisibility, the prime numbers, have functions<br/>larger than those of all of the smaller numbers, and the larger the primes,<br/>the larger the function. This fitted well into the requirements; but no<br/>difference was made between the functions of 1 and 2, or 3, 4 and 6, or 7<br/>and 9, etc. I had to keep looking After some extensive if not exhaustive<br/>experimentation, I finally came up with following seemingly workable formula<br/>[<a href="http://www.mhs-muenster.de/Dozenten/Hajdu/Articles/LowEnergy.pdf">http://www.mhs-muenster.de/Dozenten/Hajdu/Articles/LowEnergy.pdf</a> , page 2<br/>(1)] (Arranging the numbers 2 to 9 for example in order of increasing<br/>indigestibility, one gets [2-4-3-8-6-9-5-7], which I would say compares<br/>pretty well with the guess hazarded above&quot;.</p><p>From here, it was only a small step to the derivation of the &quot;harmonicity&quot;<br/>formula [<a href="http://www.mhs-muenster.de/Dozenten/Hajdu/Articles/LowEnergy.pdf">http://www.mhs-muenster.de/Dozenten/Hajdu/Articles/LowEnergy.pdf</a>,<br/>page 2 (2)] which also yields the &quot;polarity&quot; of an interval (a striking<br/>effect when comparing a fourth with a fifth, or minor third with a major<br/>third).</p><p>I hope this helps answering your question.</p><p>BTW, Barlow&apos;s pioneering paper can be ordered from<br/>Frog Peak in the US (<a href="http://www.frogpeak.org/">http://www.frogpeak.org/</a>) or directly from Feedback<br/>Verlag in Cologne (<a href="http://genterstr.hypermart.net/feedback.html">http://genterstr.hypermart.net/feedback.html</a>).</p><p>Georg</p></div><h3>PERLICH@ACADIAN-ASSET.COM</h3><span>1/27/2001 3:11:11 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Thanks Georg. Now I wonder if<br/>you&apos;d care to comment on your<br/>application of Barlow&apos;s function<br/>to your paper. You seem to be<br/>after a notion of &quot;consonance&quot;,<br/>and bring up some recent<br/>psychoacoustic concepts in<br/>defining it, yet rather than<br/>investigating the mathematics of<br/>these phenomena themselves,<br/>you bring in Barlow&apos;s function to<br/>stand for consonance. Can you<br/>elaborate on your reasoning<br/>behind this move?</p></div>
