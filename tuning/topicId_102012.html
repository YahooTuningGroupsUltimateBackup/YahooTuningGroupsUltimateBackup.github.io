This time, there&apos;s a rolloff meaning that the intensity is inversely proportional to frequency. It&apos;s a stereo sound where one channel contains frequencies of 1:5:9:13:17:... while the other contains frequencies of 3:7:11:15:19:...</p><p><a href="http://dl.dropbox.com/u/8497979/1vs3_over_4_rolloff.wav">http://dl.dropbox.com/u/8497979/1vs3_over_4_rolloff.wav</a></p><p>Although only one of them actually contains a sine wave of 1Hz, the general periodicity of 1Hz is obvious in both of them. And although none of them contains a sine wave of 4Hz, the partial periodicity of 4Hz is also pretty apparent in both of them.</p><p>What&apos;s more, since the impulses which are 250 ms apart are just 90-degree or -90-degree phase-shifted copies of each other, then summing the two channels results in a square wave while subtracting them results in an approximated phase-shifted square wave delayed by 250 ms. Of course, it&apos;s mathematically impossible to exactly phase-shift a &quot;step&quot; or a &quot;switch&quot; because the resulting impulse would run into infinitely high amplitudes and infinite lengths. But the periodic approximations given here are very good anyway.</p><p>Petr</p></div>
