I don&apos;t doubt that Jerry is hearing the interval move, but I<br/>don&apos;t hear it myself.  Perhaps this phenomena is more in the realm of<br/>individual psychology -- each one of us has a lifetime of experience with<br/>musical materials, and the ways in which we experience and identify these<br/>materials can be highly individualized.   Personally, I am quite struck by<br/>the beating in the pythagorean and 48:19 versions, find the 2:3:5 version to<br/>be -- as Alvin Lucier would put it -- &quot;clear, like gin&quot;, but am very<br/>attracted to the septimal, which beats, but in a way I like (Talisker,<br/>perhaps?).</p><p>If your main performing situation is with choral voices, where even a unison<br/>is more a matter of faith than fact,  the amount of wavering is probably<br/>going to be well within the whole range of intervals we&apos;ve been discussing.</p><p>For what it&apos;s worth, I&apos;ve added two more downloadable WAV files with the<br/>same chord:</p><p><a href="http://home.snafu.de/djwolf/9.7.WAV">http://home.snafu.de/djwolf/9.7.WAV</a><br/>has the tenth tuned to 18:7 (the septimal 9:7 plus an octave)</p><p>and</p><p><a href="http://home.snafu.de/djwolf/81.64.WAV">http://home.snafu.de/djwolf/81.64.WAV</a><br/>has the tenth tuned to 81:32 (the pythagorean 81:64 plus an octave)</p><p>these now join the previously mentioned:</p><p><a href="http://home.snafu.de/djwolf/24.19.WAV">http://home.snafu.de/djwolf/24.19.WAV</a><br/>where the 10th is tuned 48:19 (or 24:19 plus an octave)</p><p>and</p><p><a href="http://home.snafu.de/djwolf/5.3.2.WAV">http://home.snafu.de/djwolf/5.3.2.WAV</a><br/>where the 10th is tuned 5:2 (5:4 plus an octave)</p><p>The chords are played twice, once with sines, once with triangle waves, in<br/>each case, a sustained Major 10th is joined, with a delay, by a tone 3:2<br/>above the lower tone in the tenth:</p><p> Daniel Wolf<br/> <a href="http://home.snafu.de/djwolf/">http://home.snafu.de/djwolf/</a></p></div>
