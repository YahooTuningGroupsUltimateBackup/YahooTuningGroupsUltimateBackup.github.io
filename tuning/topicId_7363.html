Let&apos;s see . . . Two of the unit vectors can be read off<br/>the lattice (by looking at the instances of C, for example) as 224:225 and<br/>384:385; in your first lattice the Ex/Gbb dichotomy suggests a ratio of<br/>121:120; and since you don&apos;t have any commatic pairs it looks like 81:80<br/>might be the last one. Factoring these ratios:</p><p>224:225 = [2^5*]3^(-2)*5^(-2)*7^1*11^0<br/>384:385 = [2^7*]3^1*5^(-1)*7^(-1)*11^(-1)<br/>120:121 = [2^3*]3^1*5^1*7^0*11^(-2)<br/>80:81 = [2^4*]3^(-4)*5^1*7^0*11^0</p><p>So the Fokker matrix is</p><p>    -2    -2     1     0<br/>     1    -1    -1    -1<br/>     1     1     0    -2<br/>    -4     1     0     0</p><p>and the determinant of that matrix is -31. Looks like a winner! So your<br/>temperament distibutes the two smaller commas but not the two larger ones.<br/>It is much like the diatonic scale in meantone, which can be seen as a<br/>7-tone 2-d p.d. with unison vectors 81:80 and 25:24 where the smaller comma<br/>is distributed but the larger comma is not, or my symmetrical decatonic<br/>scale, which can be seen as a 10-tone 3-d p.d. with unison vectors 64:63,<br/>50:49, and 49:48, where the two smaller commas are distributed but the<br/>larger is not.</p><p>In your second lattice (where it appears you misspelled a few Fbbs as Fb)<br/>the 224:225 and 384:385 unison vectors can still be found in the lattice.<br/>The B#/Cb dichotomy suggests a 100:99 comma; the 121:120 is gone, while the<br/>81:80 appears to remain a delimiting vector.</p><p>100:99 = [2^2*]3^(-2)*5^2*7^0*11^(-1)</p><p>F.M.:</p><p>    -2    -2     1     0<br/>     1    -1    -1    -1<br/>    -2     2     0    -1<br/>    -4     1     0     0</p><p>Determinant: -19</p><p>So there are only 19 different notes in the corresponding p.d., though your<br/>lattice still shows 31. That means this one is not equivalent to a tempered<br/>periodicity block, or at least not one with these commas. I see -- what&apos;s<br/>happening is that although you consider one B# to be inadmissable because<br/>it&apos;s 100:99 from Cb, another B# 80:81 away from the inadmissable one is<br/>right there in the lattice. So although you don&apos;t have any 100:99 pairs or<br/>80:81 pairs, you must have 12 pairs separated by the product, 45:44 (=38.9<br/>cents in JI). It is suggestive that for the second lattice you state: &quot;It<br/>may be useful when fewer than 31 tones are to be made available.&quot; Hmmm...</p></div>
