It seemed to work ONCE that<br/>way... but I tried the operation of removing the &quot;cents&quot; text again<br/>in Notepad.</p><p>All that happened was that the text, upon reopening, was spread out<br/>in a &quot;straight line&quot; and was not formatted properly for Scala.</p><p>I tried repeating this procedure a couple of times with the same<br/>result.</p><p>THEN, I tried using &quot;word wrap&quot; in Notepad.  Well, it &quot;wrapped&quot; the<br/>text, but not in the way that Scala would need.</p><p>FINALLY, in exasperation, I tried Microsoft Word, deleting the<br/>&quot;cents&quot; text and saving the file in &quot;text&quot; format.</p><p>Well, the columns and Scala formatting SEEMED correct, but Scala<br/>seems to feel this is &quot;not a Scala file...&quot;</p><p>The whole point of this example is the fact that it is not<br/>necessarily as EASY to save, download and upload Scala text as one<br/>might imagine...</p><p>For that reason, it is possibly best left to the experts, like Manuel<br/>Op. de Coul....</p><p>Regardless, I&apos;m deleting MY file and leaving Manuel&apos;s which is<br/>WORKING!!</p><p>_______ _____ __ __ _<br/>Joseph Pehrson</p></div>
