In general, though, I  really like the idea<br/>&gt; of nailing down one pitch and letting the others find<br/>&gt; themselves according to the harmonic needs of the sequence.<br/>&gt; I&apos;ll  play with adding that capability to the program, and<br/>&gt; should have some  trial results by Monday, if not sooner.</p><p>&gt; [Christopher Chapman, TD 499.7]<br/>&gt; This may sound silly, but would it help to have the equivalent<br/>&gt; of a set of &quot;open strings&quot;?  For example: on my violin the<br/>&gt; open strings are (usually): G D A E.  I don&apos;t have to play<br/>&gt; the strings open at all, but I can play them occasionally<br/>&gt; to make sure that my fingerings haven&apos;t drifted too far.<br/>&gt; Maybe you can chose a small set of grounded pitches that<br/>&gt; are the equivalent, rather than grounding all of them or<br/>&gt; only one of them.</p><p>Christopher&apos;s approach is an interesting one.</p><p>There are two others I plan to incorporate in my JustMusic<br/>software: allowing the user to specify the &apos;root&apos; of the<br/>target of a modulation, and using an algorithm derived<br/>from Partch&apos;s &apos;three observations&apos; concerning his idea<br/>of &apos;field of attraction&apos; (see Partch 1974, p 182-183).</p><p>Paul Erlich&apos;s &apos;harmonic entropy&apos; concept is related to<br/>Partch&apos;s, and could provide another approach.
