Here the interesting feature is<br/>that the accidentals are split into left/right keys rather than<br/>front/back keys; I&apos;m not sure how prevalent these arrangements might<br/>have been. Anyway, Manuel and Dave, the illustrations you have made<br/>available look very similar to a drawing of Costeley&apos;s 19-tET<br/>keyboard in Kenneth Levy&apos;s article, also with the accidental keys<br/>(other than E# and B#) split left/right.</p><p>The main point I&apos;d like to stress is that Zarlino&apos;s 16-note JI<br/>keyboard is different: the D key would be split into two parts (for<br/>the two versions of this note an 81:80 apart), and likewise the Bb,<br/>Eb, and F# keys. However, for example, there wouldn&apos;t be an extra key<br/>between E and F, or between B and C -- the E# and B# keys in<br/>meantone.</p><p>By the way, I&apos;m looking at a JI keyboard in Hercole Bottrigari&apos;s<br/>treatise of 1594, _Il Desiderio_, which has a key between the usual C<br/>and D for the alternative D, and extra notes for alternative versions<br/>of Eb and Bb -- his discussion for this model focuses on just the<br/>diatonic notes plus Eb and Bb as the basic gamut, giving 9 notes plus<br/>the three alternative versions, or 12 notes per octave in all.</p><p>The note between C and D is a single key, while the Eb and Bb keys are<br/>split front/back.</p><p>Vicentino&apos;s keyboard manuals use the front/back arrangement. His lower<br/>manual in a usual 19-note meantone thus has three &quot;ranks&quot; -- first the<br/>seven diatonic notes, then the five usual accidentals (C#, Eb, F#, G#,<br/>Bb), then the seven less usual ones. We apparently have a front/back<br/>split of C#/Db, Eb/D#, F#/Gb, G#/Ab, Bb/A#, plus E# between E and F,<br/>and B# between B and C.</p><p>Anyway, thanks both Manuel and Dave for these 19-note meantone<br/>keyboard illustrations. I&apos;ve seen a drawing of Zarlino&apos;s 16-note JI<br/>keyboard somewhere, and comparing it with the 19-note design might<br/>make the differences clearer.</p><p>Most appreciatively,</p><p>Margo Schulter<br/><a href="mailto:mschulter@value.net">mschulter@value.net</a></p></div>
