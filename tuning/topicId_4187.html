Talk about  math. Well he it goes  Maybe Joe should include this<br/>under MOS.</p><p>This is a formula for finding the MOS of a given generator. It work even if you<br/>don&apos;t understand it. You need a scientific calulator though that can do 1/x or X-1<br/>(the negative one is an exponent). These two are the same thing and will give you<br/>the antilog of the log of the interval generator we will be using.</p><p>Lets take for example the the 3/2 and see what the MOS are. first we find the log.<br/>.5849625007<br/>now we are going to find what is referred to as the the Zig-Zag pattern which we can<br/>use on the scale tree but is&apos;t nessicery.. One more thing before we start. that is<br/>the limitations of calulators. We will be subtracting numbers from the left which<br/>means after 9 steps our orgininal data of 10 numbers (.5849625007) will be gone. the<br/>last number7 is questioable as being appox. so we only go 9 places. You can go<br/>further but you are calulating calulator artifacts not the real thing. To go further<br/>you need to get a bigger machine.<br/> now we find the antilog (1/x or the X-1)   this is 1.709511291 we subtract the<br/>number to the left of the decimal point, place it in a column and repeat this<br/>process 8 more times.</p><p>example from beginning<br/>.5849625007    1/x=<br/>1.709511291    -1=           1 l<br/>.7095112914    1/x=<br/>1.40942084      -1=           1 r<br/>.40942084        1/x=<br/>2.442474596     -2 =         2 l<br/>.442474596      1/x=<br/>2.260016753     -2=          2 r<br/>.260016753      1/x=<br/>3.845906042    -3=          3 l<br/>.845906042      1/x=<br/>1.18216439      -1=          1 r<br/>.18216439        1/x=<br/>5.489547094    -5=          5 l<br/>.489547094      1/x=<br/>2.042704393    -2=          2 r<br/>.042704393      1/x=<br/>23.41679441    -23          23 l</p><p>that&apos;s are far as we can go! Now we either go to the scale tree or construct one. We<br/>put 0/1 and 1/1 (or find this on the scale tree) at the top of a page widely spaced<br/>to insert data in between. using what Wilson calls &quot;Freshman Sums&quot; (adding the<br/>numerators, then the numerators) we move toward the left of 1/1 (always the starting<br/>place). This means we add the number by freshman sums that to the left. Its always<br/>the diagonal directly above. we move 1 to the left being our first number 0/1+1/1 =<br/>1/2. we place this somewhat below with lines diagonally down from the 0/1 and 1/1<br/>(simile throughout)<br/>then 1 to the  right (adding the 1/1+2/1 =2/3<br/>then 2 to the left (add 2/3+1/2= 3/5 then +1/2 again=4/7<br/>then 2 to the right (4/7+3/5=7/12, 7/12+3/5=10/17<br/>then 3 to the left (10/17+7/12=17/29, +7/12=24/41, +7/12=31/53<br/>then 1 to the  right  (31/53+24/41=55/94<br/>then 5 to the left  (55/94+31/53=86/147,+31/53=117/200,+31/53=148/253,<br/>+31/53=179/306, +31/53=210/359)<br/>then 2 to the right (210/359+179/306=389/665, +179/306=568/971<br/>then 23 to the left you can do this one. see  <a href="http://www.anaphoria.com/ST10.html">http://www.anaphoria.com/ST10.html</a>  as<br/>a main section of this diagonal down.<br/>The denominator is the MOS the numerator is number of steps of the generator.</p><p>Feedback sought!</p><p>Kraig Grady wrote:</p><p>&gt;  I realize that Erv fomula for finding the MOS of a given<br/>&gt; Generator is not up so I am going to put it up in a seperate post so it does&apos;nt<br/>&gt; get lost in the middle of this!</p><p>-- Kraig Grady<br/>North American Embassy of Anaphoria Island<br/><a href="http://www.anaphoria.com">http://www.anaphoria.com</a></p></div><h3><a id=4416 href="#4416">ðŸ”—</a>gbreed@xxx.xxxxxxxxx.xx.xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx)</h3><span>8/23/1999 3:35:00 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>In-Reply-To: &lt;<a href="mailto:934022737.27733@onelist.com">934022737.27733@onelist.com</a>&gt;<br/>Back in digest 273, message 15 Kraig Grady gave a formula, and asked<br/>for feedback on it.  Well, sorry this is a bit late coming, but yes<br/>it looks simple and effective.  I&apos;ve managed to tell my computer how<br/>to go left and right along the tree, and so it can now reproduce the<br/>zig-zag.  I&apos;ll try and get the code into an applet for my website<br/>sometime.</p></div>
