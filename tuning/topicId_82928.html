His &quot;Diaphonic Cycles&quot; generally consist of a linearly divided 5th conjoined with a similarly linearly divided 4th (though the 4ths and 5ths are not necessarily 4/3 and 3/2 and may be 11/8-16/11 or 7/5-10/7 etc. in more finely divided cases). He also invented some simpler scales such as Helix Song, which, IIRC, consists of two short segments of the harmonic series a 5th part (within an octave). The details may be at the <a href="http://anaphoria.com">anaphoria.com</a> Wilson Archives site.</p><p>Some decades ago, someone named Gwynn, IIRC, published a couple of abstracts in the annual meeting of the Acoustic Society of America on successive ratio interval approximations to the 12-tone gamut. There were also a couple of abstracts on &quot;coupled incremental scales,&quot; which in JI would be scales of this type.
