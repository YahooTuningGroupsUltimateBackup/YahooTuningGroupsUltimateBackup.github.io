My post yesterday was a few thoughts off the top of my head to try to stir up a little meaningful discussion on the nature of music.  Microtonal for the sake of microtonal has little meaning for me--how does it move us beyond Bach, Mozart, Beethoven, Wagner, Mahler--even Copeland and Bernstein?  Does it grab me like these guys?  These guys have survived because they can still touch our souls--their music has kung fu.  It wasn&apos;t intellectual, commercial or entertainment(well maybe a little)--but more importantly it was an expression of the human soul--even through the system of compromise of 12TET.</p><p>Years ago in the 70&apos;s I worked for Austin Organ Company and then a few years with a builder who restored old tracker organs in New England--I got very involved in tuning and did extensive research in the proliferation of tuning systems around the time of Bach and Silbermann(famous organ builder during Bach&apos;s time)--Bach couldn&apos;t have done what he did without 12TET.  It was a revolution, but it contained its own limitation within its structure.  I would love to converse with you about the simple ideas I have been working with for years--unfortunately I am not a composer--I doodle around on the horn with the overtone series and bought an old ensoniq sampler keyboard that I can tune but never much success in creating a composition.</p><p>But think on this--imagine that God exists as the One vibration/eternity.  All of the infinite harmonics generated from this one vibration are the foundation of the universe.  And 2 and the powers of 2, the feminine or form of the creative energy, form the generations which become the structure in which the universe exists (this is all right out of Hindu music theory).  And the prime numbers are unique creations, related only to itself and the One, that unfold within each successive generation.  Each generation is an octave in the harmonic overtone series.  Each prime also initiates an infinite harmonic field of its own through its relationship with the feminine (2).</p><p>My simple thought is: that as when I sit in the living room and play my horn, objects around the room resonate with different tones I produce, sympathetic vibration, so we too in the worlds of time, from atoms to sunsets, vibrate sympathetically with the &quot;tones&quot; of the eternal creation and conversely we can explore and perhaps come to understand some of the relationships of the eternal through musical exploration.  But the tones must be pure so that they reinforce the fundamental--and I believe that we can tune the fundamentals to vibrate with elements of the Eternal.  Hence my preoccupation with Fundamental pitches as ultimately being more important than the intervals themselves--in a scale the intervals should reinforce the fundamental.</p><p>Thank you for your patience.<br/>Bruce</p><p>---------------------------------<br/>Do you Yahoo!?<br/>The New Yahoo!

It was a revolution, but it contained its<br/>&gt; own limitation within its structure.</p><p>it&apos;s been argued by several people, including most prominently<br/>on this list Johnny Reinhard (Werkmeister III) and Anton<br/>Kellner (with his own reconstructed &quot;Bach tuning&quot;) that<br/>Bach&apos;s preferred tuning was not 12edo (AKA 12-tET), but<br/>rather a 12-tone &quot;circulating&quot; temperament which has wide<br/>variety of interval sizes.</p><p>i think by now it&apos;s pretty firmly established that Bach<br/>wrote his _Well-Tempered Klavier_ *not* to demonstrate 12edo<br/>but rather to demonstrate a circulating well-temperament.</p><p>as for the preferred tunings of other composers in your list ...</p><p>Mozart had two intended tunings: for keyboards, a circulating<br/>well-temperament, and for orchestral works, a meantone along<br/>the lines of 55edo or 1/6-comma meantone.  see my webpage:</p><p><a href="http://sonic-arts.org/monzo/55edo/55edo.htm">http://sonic-arts.org/monzo/55edo/55edo.htm</a></p><p>and even at his late date, Mahler commented that it was too<br/>bad that Europe gave up meantone.  see my page</p><p><a href="http://sonic-arts.org/monzo/schoenberg/Vienna1905.htm">http://sonic-arts.org/monzo/schoenberg/Vienna1905.htm</a></p><p>around the years 1904 - 1907, when Mahler was in close<br/>contact with Schoenberg ... which in fact are precisely<br/>the years that Mahler&apos;s harmonic practice began leaning<br/>away from meantone and more towards 12edo -- clearly<br/>a result of discussions with Schoenberg.</p><p>if you examine the detailed explanation of 12edo which<br/>i give at the beginning of this page:</p><p><a href="http://sonic-arts.org/dict/bingo.htm">http://sonic-arts.org/dict/bingo.htm</a></p><p>you should get an idea of exactly why 12edo became such<br/>a universally accepted tuning.</p><p>indeed, 12edo &quot;contained its own limitation within its<br/>structure&quot; ... but how could any tuning with only 12 notes,<br/>and all of them space equally, *not* expose its limitations<br/>fairly quickly?</p><p>Schoenberg was the first composer to really see this,<br/>and he reacted strongly, first by experimenting with<br/>quarter-tones, then by creating his &quot;12-tone method&quot;.</p><p>... fortunately, we today are in a technological position<br/>to be able to gleefully experiment with any tuning system<br/>we desire.</p><p>&gt; I would love to converse with you about the simple ideas<br/>&gt; I have been working with for years--unfortunately I am not<br/>&gt; a composer--I doodle around on the horn with the overtone<br/>&gt; series and bought an old ensoniq sampler keyboard that I<br/>&gt; can tune but never much success in creating a composition.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; But think on this--imagine that God exists as the One<br/>&gt; vibration/eternity.
