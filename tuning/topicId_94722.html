For example, in the Wicki layout the period (typically the octave) is mapped to buttons vertically above each other two rows apart, while the generator is mapped to the button diagonally up and right.</p><p>Given an appropriate shear, any such layout has some interesting properties:</p><p>1. The axis that connects tones octaves apart is a pitch axis - the position of any tone on this axis indicates its pitch.<br/>2. The axis orthogonal to the pitch axis gives the distance in generators (e.g. perfect fifths) between any two tones</p><p>But, for any given MOS scale, the actual choice of layout can be &quot;optimised&quot;. The Wicki layout is &quot;optimal&quot; for MOS scales where the number of small or large steps is 2 - e.g. the diatonic scale MOS 5L 2S, the pentatonic scale MOS 2L 3S, Mavila scales MOS 2L 5S, etc. It is optimal because the pattern made by the MOS is easy to comprehend, for the following reason (there is another I won&apos;t go into, for now):</p><p>3. The most common scale steps are traversed by moving stepwise (spatially) across a row, the less common scale steps are traversed by a &quot;carriage return&quot; motion to the next higher row. For example, in Wicki, you start on C go right to D go right to E, do a &quot;carriage return&quot; to the next row above for F, go right to G, go right to A, go right to B, do a carriage return to the next row above for C, and so on.</p><p>This third feature can be made available for any given MOS.

So in the MOS 5L 2S scale (i.e. the familiar<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; diatonic) there are five large steps (major seconds) and two<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; small steps (minor seconds). The large steps are the more<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; common of the two, and in Wicki they are spatially adjacent.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; Ah, that makes sense.

If the MOS has a spatially compact representation, so will its embedded chords (and the adjacent seconds layouts are spatially compact), and this helps make chords easy to finger. But compactness is just one factor: another important aspect is orientation---the right hand can more easily play shapes that are oriented on a NE line than on a NW line.

It is certainly cheaper to make flat keyboards<br/>and transport them.

This is a reason to favor rectangular or<br/>oblong keys -- it lets the hand move while holding a note<br/>(i.e. it makes a given note accessible from more hand<br/>positions).  This is also an advantage for rectangular<br/>layouts (90deg), because only on such layouts can a key on<br/>a given row pass *between* keys on adjacent rows.  These<br/>considerations are helpful in contrapuntal playing.<br/>I felt their lack on Michael Zarkey&apos;s 19-tone harpsichord<br/>and Scott Hackelman&apos;s 19-tone clavichord, and it&apos;s one<br/>thing I don&apos;t like about the otherwise incredible Horvath/<br/>Terpstra design.

It&apos;s simply not realistic<br/>to play around with layouts for an hour each and be able to<br/>fairly compare them, especially if they differ in more than<br/>one way (shape of digitals, size of keys, etc etc).  You<br/>may be able to compare their initial ease of use, but their<br/>ultimate ease of use is more important.</p><p>It took me over a year after quitting cold turkey to reach<br/>my old QWERTY speeds on Dvorak, and I don&apos;t think I surpassed<br/>them until the current Apple desktop keyboards came out in<br/>2007 (well, I had them in &apos;07... maybe we didn&apos;t ship them<br/>until &apos;08).  I hated them at first, but they are objectively<br/>the best keyboards because they require so little force and<br/>so little clearance between keys.  So it&apos;s hard to evaluate<br/>things.

Following that logic, counterclockwise around from 10/9 we would get 10/9, 8/7, 36/35, 9/10, 7/8, 35/36. So we have both 10/9-8/7 and 8/7-36/35 as adjacent pairs; the first corresponding to an 18-note non-MOS and the second to an 11-note MOS. Pairs like 36/35-9/10 correspond to non-adjacent (120 degree) pairs such as 10/9-36/35. So you could indeed get the 10/9-8/7 pair at second hand, so to speak, from the 4L7s MOS. The 4L3s MOS corresponds to 7/6-36/35, which gives a hexagon 7/6, 36/35, 7/8, 6/7, 35/36, 8/7, which also has adjacent 8/7-7/6, with a 10-note non-MOS scale, or modulus, or whatever you wish to call it.</p></div><h3><a id=94841 href="#94841">ðŸ”—</a>Chris Vaisvil &#x3C;chrisvaisvil@...&#x3E;</h3><span>11/23/2010 6:01:53 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Thanks John!!</p><p>Wow - this is pretty involved!</p><p>On Tue, Nov 23, 2010 at 3:44 PM, John Moriarty &lt;JlMoriart@...&gt; wrote:</p><p>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; It looks like in the videos you can exchange the caps on your AXiS.

Semi-attached to the board will be the<br/>&gt; buttons that make contact with the board when the key-tops are<br/>&gt; depressed. They are all held together in a sort of rubber sheet and<br/>&gt; have little stubs that fit into holes in the circuit board to hold<br/>&gt; them in place, but they are not physically attached to the board.<br/>&gt; (Upon reconstruction of the unit, it is important that they line up<br/>&gt; correctly with the board.)<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Upon the rubber sheet&apos;s removal you are left with the physical keys<br/>&gt; and the top half of the unit. The process of remapping the key tops is<br/>&gt; dead easy: you just remove a small bottom peg of the key-top that holds it<br/>&gt; secure, and the top of the button comes right off the top of the unit.<br/>&gt; Do this for every key and place the tops in your new desired pattern.<br/>&gt; (If you want to repaint the keys at all, this is the time to do it.)<br/>&gt; As you&apos;re rearranging the keytops, place the little key bottoms back<br/>&gt; on to secure them in place. (This is a point at which you must be<br/>&gt; careful. If the little key bottoms are not 100% attached back to the<br/>&gt; key-top, that key will stick out a little compared to the rest when<br/>&gt; the unit is reassembled and you will have to take the whole thing<br/>&gt; apart again and make sure that it is all the way attached. Also, do<br/>&gt; this over hard floors so if you drop anything you can find it!)<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Finally, once all the key tops and bottoms are all in place, start<br/>&gt; reassembling the unit. Make sure that the rubber button contacts are<br/>&gt; lined up with the circuit board and reattach them to the unit with<br/>&gt; your screws, and then reattach the bottom to the whole unit. Check to<br/>&gt; see that all the keys are level, plug it in, and make some music!<br/>&gt; ________________________________<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Let me know if you have any questions.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; John<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;</p></div><h3><a id=94842 href="#94842">ðŸ”—</a>genewardsmith &#x3C;genewardsmith@...&#x3E;</h3><span>11/23/2010 6:18:22 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;genewardsmith&quot; &lt;genewardsmith@...&gt; wrote:</p><p>&gt; It seems it makes the most sense to look at the whole hexagon, and not just an adjacent pair. Following that logic, counterclockwise around from 10/9 we would get 10/9, 8/7, 36/35, 9/10, 7/8, 35/36. So we have both 10/9-8/7 and 8/7-36/35 as adjacent pairs; the first corresponding to an 18-note non-MOS and the second to an 11-note MOS. Pairs like 36/35-9/10 correspond to non-adjacent (120 degree) pairs such as 10/9-36/35. So you could indeed get the 10/9-8/7 pair at second hand, so to speak, from the 4L7s MOS. The 4L3s MOS corresponds to 7/6-36/35, which gives a hexagon 7/6, 36/35, 7/8, 6/7, 35/36, 8/7, which also has adjacent 8/7-7/6, with a 10-note non-MOS scale, or modulus, or whatever you wish to call it.<br/>&gt;</p><p>Most often 2 will be inside one of the 1/6 pie pie-slices for a generator pair, which is presumably the canonical pair for that particular hexagon. That would mean 8/7-36/35 with the 4L7s MOS for the first of these hexagons, and 7/6-36/35 with the 4L3s MOS for the second. It would be nice to have either a proof the canonical pair is always a MOS, or an example of where it isn&apos;t. I have an idea of how you might prove it, but this is getting off-topic for the tuning list.</p></div>
