If I take the neutral third in these two systems and<br/>repeat it over and over, I can arrive at these scales as one of the<br/>stopping points.</p><p>&gt; There has been quite a bit of investigation on<br/>&gt; chain-of-neutral third tunings . . . might I ask Gene and Graham to<br/>&gt; chime in with some comments, cloaked in as little obscure theoretical<br/>&gt; terminology as possible, so that Robert will view them as &quot;musical&quot;?<br/>&gt;</p><p>Hi Paul, sorry to have used the &quot;m&quot; word. Talking about music is like<br/>dancing about architecture so, yes, there will be disconnects<br/>between how different people choose to express understanding of<br/>certain phenomena.</p><p>As I alluded to, the thing I was more interested in was the meantone<br/>vs pythagorean mapping that was going on.

Perhaps this is a bit pedestrian, but although<br/>some the neutral thirds and a variety of crumpled near-fifths are<br/>available in both, I was just looking at a new scale with major and<br/>minor modes. In fact, its probably even easier to see what I<br/>was thinking of by writing it out in note names</p><p>C Cx   Eb Dx   F Fx    G Gx   Bb B#<br/>C Fbbb Eb Gbbb F Bbbbb G Cbbb Bb Ebbbb</p><p>(basing note names on chain-of-fifth diatonics 5535553 and<br/>7737773).</p><p>Here the traids, pentatonics, stacks of fourths, etc in the<br/>two systems are clear, and the warped connections to the two<br/>spirals of fifths is also clear (showing that the similar<br/>resources are doing different things on the &apos;big crystal&apos;).</p><p>One of the reasons I haven&apos;t gotten too &apos;into&apos; the 72<br/>discussion is because bicycle chains require a different way<br/>of thinking than this.

If you extended the system<br/>to 14 notes per octave, you&apos;d have exactly two diatonic scales in it.<br/>It&apos;s interesting to see where the 7-limit and other intervals pop<br/>up . . . though neither of these scales excels at producing them.</p><p>&gt; One of the reasons I haven&apos;t gotten too &apos;into&apos; the 72<br/>&gt; discussion is because bicycle chains require a different way<br/>&gt; of thinking than this.</p><p>Not necessarily. For example, the MIRACLE tuning is a chain of fifths<br/>too, except that now the fifth is equal to _six_ generators, not just<br/>two. I don&apos;t see any conceptual difference here: the period of<br/>repetition is still an octave in this scale; you could tune it in<br/>some tuning where the chain of fifths doesn&apos;t close on itself if you<br/>so desired; etc.</p></div><h3><a id=31390 href="#31390">ðŸ”—</a>dkeenanuqnetau &#x3C;d.keenan@uq.net.au&#x3E;</h3><span>12/11/2001 3:39:59 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In tuning@y..., &quot;paulerlich&quot; &lt;paul@s...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt; Not necessarily.
