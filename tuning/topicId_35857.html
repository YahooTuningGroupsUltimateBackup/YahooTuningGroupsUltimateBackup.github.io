Well, I don&apos;t remember the experiment you suggested for my<br/>&gt; choir, so feel free to remind me, please.</p><p>I&apos;m aware of your press for time,Bob, so it is likely you simply missed this<br/>post. It is so important to our conversation, however, that I&apos;ll paste it<br/>here in its entirely (apologies to others for the long scroll). The<br/>&quot;experiment&quot; is about five responses down.</p><p>-----------------</p><p>On 3/18/02 6:10 PM, I responded to Bob&apos;s post:</p><p>&gt; Message: 16<br/>&gt;  Date: Mon, 18 Mar 2002 22:44:08 -0000<br/>&gt;  From: &quot;robert_wendell&quot; &lt;<a href="mailto:rwendell@cangelic.org">rwendell@cangelic.org</a>&gt;<br/>&gt; Subject: Re: Jerries: a conclusion or two<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Hi, everyone! My apologies for not hanging around here lately, but<br/>&gt; I&apos;ve been terribly busy with music and life in general. Paul E. had<br/>&gt; once mentioned to me in an offline email something about this fellow<br/>&gt; with the jazz choir that likes high thirds. I will call them &quot;supra-<br/>&gt; ET&quot; thirds.</p><p>Hi, Bob. Nice to be acknowledged, even in third person. I guess you didn&apos;t<br/>see my posts directly intended for you. Welcome back. Good timing!<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I agree that the best renaissance a cappella choirs sing just thirds.<br/>&gt; The ones that don&apos;t are simply demonstrating relative incompetence<br/>&gt; vis-a-vis those that do. Renaissance a cappella music is very triadic<br/>&gt; in its harmonic strucuture; meantone temperaments with pure or quasi-<br/>&gt; pure thirds were the order of the day; so it is natural to sing that<br/>&gt; music with just thirds.</p><p>Here&apos;s the issue, Robert. Suppose a &quot;best&quot; choir responsibly and knowingly<br/>sings JI thirds, but &quot;less hip&quot; ears *hear* those JI thirds as &quot;high&quot;<br/>thirds. Does that make the listeners &quot;incompetent&quot;? Suppose those listeners<br/>sing in other choirs and attempt to tune carefully as they re-create the<br/>music of the Renaissance; and in the process those choirs sing the high<br/>thirds they &quot;think&quot; they heard upon listening to the &quot;best&quot; choirs.</p><p>Suppose you were able to go back to the Renaissance and actually *hear* what<br/>sort of thirds choirs were singing then. Is it completely out of the realm<br/>of possibility that some of those sixteenth century ears heard a difference<br/>between a third sung with root and third sounding and one sung with root<br/>alone? How would you know? Would you ask them? Would you assume that *they*<br/>would know? Are you sure historians would know for sure?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; My reaction to the &quot;supra-ET&quot; thirds in the jazz chorus and the<br/>&gt; renaissance choirs&apos; contrast with that is simple:</p><p>Be careful of the word &quot;simple.&quot; Simplicity can sometimes be just as<br/>illusive as a the truth about high thirds. I used to think high thirds were<br/>&quot;simply&quot; the only ones anyone used. I don&apos;t think that anymore. And, as we<br/>all now know, the world is not &quot;simply&quot; flat.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Jazz harmonies contain harmonic extensions such as 7ths, 9ths, and<br/>&gt; 13ths (sixths if in close-voiced &quot;6th-9th chords&quot;). Many such chords,<br/>&gt; especially the &quot;6th-9th&quot; chords just mentioned, can be voiced open<br/>&gt; in &quot;stacked fourths&quot; and variations of them such as stacked fourths<br/>&gt; with a third on top or an augmented fourth on the bottom (which is<br/>&gt; the 7th with resepect to the root, the latter of which is generally<br/>&gt; on top in this kind of voicing (e.g. Bb, E, A, D, G, C, which in<br/>&gt; close-voicing with the root at the bottom is C, E, G, Bb, D with an A<br/>&gt; thrown in somewhere, but this voicing is not conducive to the<br/>&gt; presence of the A as &quot;sixth&quot; or &quot;thirteenth&quot;).</p><p>Sounds like a hypothesis worth discussing sometime. Actually, it has nothing<br/>to do with the high third we&apos;re talking about here. Here&apos;s the set up:</p><p>    Play a low C and ask the basses to match it. Then ask the women to tune<br/>a tenth above it. Once tuned, compare it to the piano&apos;s E and notice that it<br/>is as one would think--slightly below. No surprise.</p><p>    Then play a low C and ask the basses to match it and ask the tenors to<br/>tune a perfect fifth above it. When the perfect fifth is in evidence, again<br/>ask the women to tune a tenth above the bass. Note that their &quot;third&quot; will<br/>be higher than the piano&apos;s third. *Big* surprise!</p><p>It works *every* time. I&apos;ve demonstrated it with my choirs, other people&apos;s<br/>choirs, and on the road with choral festival choirs I&apos;ve never met.</p><p>No 7ths, 9ths and 13ths. No 6-9 chords. Just a simple major triad. Just like<br/>in Renaissance endings.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Now we all know that fifths (and fourths, by implication) and thirds<br/>&gt; are not mutually compatible in terms of just tuning. They must be<br/>&gt; traded off with each other. In the renaissance, the tradeoff<br/>&gt; sacrificed the fifths and fourths for the thirds and sixths.</p><p>Tradeoff? Huh? Clearly, we *all* don&apos;t know this. How do *you* know this?<br/>Makes no sense to me at all. But, I&apos;m all ears! Enlighten me.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; In stacked fourth voicings and any other voicings in jazz harmony<br/>&gt; with equivalent or similar harmonic extensions, a series of fourths<br/>&gt; or fifths that are 5+ cents flat sound terribly flacid, wimpy and<br/>&gt; unconvincing, with none of the sought-for jazzy &quot;bite&quot; and sonority.<br/>&gt; This means the thirds in this context want to get sacrificed for the<br/>&gt; fourths and fifths, so ET works well here.</p><p>I found that ET didn&apos;t work at all for jazz chords. That&apos;s why I asked my<br/>rehearsal pianist to stop playing chords while the singers were *seeking*<br/>their tunings. Only when he simply provided bass roots did our hot vocal<br/>chords find their jazzy &quot;bite.&quot; By the way, our thirds were not ET; they<br/>were &quot;high.&quot; Always! Just like our Renaissance endings.</p><p>Whether they were high because they were *sung* high or because they<br/>*sounded* high is what this discussion is all about.</p><p>So, there you have it, Robert. Welcome to the discussion.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; However, I think the spread of ET as an almost universal tuning<br/>&gt; standard in our culture is partially responsible for the evolution of<br/>&gt; these harmonies in the first place.</p><p>I believe ET is the curse of fine tuning in our culture. Train a choir to<br/>sing &quot;piano pitch&quot; and I assure you it will be flat within two minutes<br/>unless the piano is there to bolster it.</p><p>&gt; There were some influences from<br/>&gt; impressionism in France that pushed this evolution, but those<br/>&gt; influences had not just a little 12-tET behind them, too.</p><p>Gershwin would likely agree with you. But then you should hear what Gershwin<br/>can sound like when sung by pitch-sensitive singers.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Now, in a flexibly pitched ensemble such as an a cappella jazz choir,</p><p>The LA Jazz Choir sang with piano, bass and drums. However, the pianist was<br/>always instructed not to comp when the choir was singing harmony and never<br/>to play the same melodic lines the choir was singing. It worked fine. But<br/>you are correct that the vocals were &quot;flexibly pitched,&quot; and certainly not<br/>ET (which you suggested above is conducive to jazz tuning).</p><p> &gt; even the other side of ET toward Pythagorean may sound better still<br/>&gt; to many ears,</p><p>last year, we explored the possibility that the Pythagorean third was the<br/>preferred &quot;high third.&quot; We all seemed to agree that it was not. Way too<br/>high.</p><p>&gt; trading off even further in favor of the fourths and<br/>&gt; fifths. But then, barbershop quartets often sing very complex jazz<br/>&gt; harmonies that still tend toward JI when the quartet is really good<br/>&gt; and well-steeped in that tradition, a tradition that largely went for<br/>&gt; very pure, sweet harmonies. Here, I would say, in stark contradicton<br/>&gt; to opinions I have expressed in other non-medieval contexts, I have<br/>&gt; to agree that it is a matter of taste.</p><p>That&apos;s what I thought when I left the list last year. I was pretty much<br/>convinced that taste was all there was to it. I&apos;m no longer convinced. There<br/>is too much agreement among listeners of the jerries to ignore the<br/>possibility that there is a specific &quot;high third&quot; that is learned from<br/>hearing the illusionary high third that generates from the JI triad. Didn&apos;t<br/>you say, upon initially hearing jerry00, that you experienced &quot;an apparent<br/>slight drop in pitch when the root and fifth drop out&quot;? Don&apos;t look now, Bob,<br/>but I think you may be &quot;in there&quot; with the rest of us.</p><p>Jerry</p><p>-------------------------(end of 3/18 quote)</p><p>--------------------------------------</p><p>Some important background, Bob, in case you didn&apos;t see it.</p><p>Posted on 3/19, 1:26pm:</p><p>Last year, during the time I was discussing this topic on the list, I ran<br/>into a list member at the American Choral Directors Association convention.<br/>Having observed the exchange on list, he offered that he &quot;prefers&quot; the JI<br/>third and urges his choir to sing it. We agreed to make somewhat of a<br/>&quot;sport&quot; of listening for high and JI thirds performed by the dozens of<br/>choirs we would hear over the next few days.</p><p>I asked him to predict which third would win the talley; and he thought the<br/>high third would. (So, evidently he was confident that he could tell the<br/>difference.) We agreed later that he was right. We both said we heard many<br/>more high thirds than JI ones.</p><p>A few months later, I listened to a recording of his choir and noted a<br/>plentiful scattering of high thirds. I thought at the time that perhaps some<br/>of those simply &quot;got past&quot; him.</p><p>Now, after hearing Paul&apos;s jerry00 as a &quot;high&quot; third, I suspect that we may<br/>have been hearing JI thirds and perceiving them as &quot;high&quot; thirds, just as I<br/>did here. Perhaps we both had been fooled by the &quot;illusion&quot; of a high third<br/>while hearing a JI one.</p><p>I could probably leave it there and go one with my life, except that I and<br/>many other singers consciously and intentionally sing thirds higher than ET.<br/>To my ear, there is a &quot;right&quot; place to tune such a third. Upon singing &quot;my&quot;<br/>high third into the JI jerry, I found I could tune it to sound &quot;consonant&quot;<br/>(but not beatless). Of course, when the root and fifth dropped out it<br/>sounded very dissonant to the sustaining JI third.</p><p>-------------(end of 3/19 post)</p><p>There was a lot more on that one that you should see, Bob. If this doesn&apos;t<br/>look familiar, it would be helpful to me and to our clear communication if<br/>you could look it up and review it. GRE)</p><p>------------------------------------------(end</p><p>Bob, here is a *CRUCIAL* post, I believe. Since you haven&apos;t responded to it<br/>(as far as I know), I&apos;ll assume you didn&apos;t see it so I&apos;ll paste it here:</p><p>------------(posted on 3/20)</p><p>Bob had said:</p><p>&gt; OK, here we go! I absolutely cannot understand this statement:</p><p>&gt;&gt; &quot;The exercise took a significant turn for me when I<br/>&gt;&gt; realized that jerry00 was JI and yet sounded like the &quot;high third.&quot;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; It was clear to me from the get-go that Jerry00 was JI. It sounds<br/>&gt; substantially lower to my ear than the truly high thirds in all the<br/>&gt; following Jerries. As stated earlier, I DO notice the subjective<br/>&gt; tendency to perceive a pitch drop when the third is left alone.<br/>&gt; However, *THIS IN NO WAY IMPLIES TO ME OR MY EAR* that the third in<br/>&gt; context with the full chord was &quot;high&quot;. It merely sounds to my ear as<br/>&gt; if a good, just third suddenly went *FLAT*, but as also stated<br/>&gt; earlier, attention focused on that specific pitch throughout clearly<br/>&gt; reveals this to be an &quot;aural illusion&quot;. This is objectively confirmed<br/>&gt; by matching the pitch with my voice and noting that there is no shift<br/>&gt; in pitch with respect to my rock-steady sung pitch.<br/>&gt;<br/>Jerry resonded:</p><p>Suppose I had said that I had heard the naked third in jerry00 clearly as a<br/>4:5 third (in relation to my imaginary extension of the root). Therefore,<br/>since Paul wouldn&apos;t have intentionally changed the actual pitch as it<br/>emerged, and because the sounding triad was quite beatless, I concluded that<br/>jerry00 was JI. Yet the third sounding in the triad appeared higher than the<br/>naked one. *That* was my moment of insight. My whole world (well, *this* one<br/>anyway) changed.</p><p>Bob, you call the naked third &quot;flat.&quot; Okay, but it *is* JI. (Otherwise, why<br/>would the triad be beatless.) You&apos;re very reluctant to acknowledge it, but I<br/>think we&apos;re pretty much hearing the same thing. You&apos;re just describing it<br/>differently. To you, evidently, the third in the triad is the *true* JI, and<br/>the *real* one is &quot;flat.&quot; Think about it. (I knew your involvement here<br/>would be valuable.)</p><p>Incidentally, most of the other jerries sound rather high to me, as well<br/>they should, since they are somewhat &quot;out of &quot;tune.&quot;  Since my vocalized<br/>*intentional* high third (as opposed to the JI one) sounds rather good with<br/>jerry00, I&apos;m curious as to whether a &quot;well-tuned&quot; real high third might also<br/>sound &quot;right,&quot; if not &quot;consonant.&quot; Maybe the damn thing works backwards, as<br/>well.</p><p>----------------(end of 3/20 post)</p><p>I hope this is helpful, Bob. Your input here is critical, I feel. Please<br/>hang in there and try to catch all the pertinent posts. I don&apos;t think we are<br/>far from some kind of resolution--be it positive or negative.</p><p>Gratefully,</p><p>Jerry</p></div>
