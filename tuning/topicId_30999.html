If they were going along in a car and somebody said &#x631;&#x627;&#x633;&#x62A; r&acirc;st, there was some confusion because the word means &quot;right (hand)&quot; in Farsi but &quot;straight&quot; in Turkish, or something like that.  I&apos;m not sure whether the word is of Persian or Arabic origin; I think it&apos;s the former.</p><p>(Linguistics happens to be my second love after music.  I&apos;m just a whole lot better at music, since the only language I can speak with a fair amount of fluency is Spanish.)</p><p>~DaW~<br/>  ----- Original Message -----<br/>  From: <a href="mailto:Afmmjr@aol.com">Afmmjr@aol.com</a><br/>  To: <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a><br/>  Sent: Monday, December 03, 2001 6:05 PM<br/>  Subject: Re: [tuning] Re: Re : The C-Fb-G major triad: Pythag-Just tuning.4</p><p>  In a message dated 12/3/01 6:06:04 PM Eastern Standard Time, <a href="mailto:paul@stretch-music.com">paul@stretch-music.com</a> writes:</p><p>    The medieval Arabic Rast is nearly identical to the modern Turkish<br/>    Rast.

That one form of medieval Arabic Rast should be &quot;nearly identical&quot; to modern Turkish Rast as to tuning is a good connection, but it is poor scholarship to use words that have exchangeable pitches for their proper names, depending upon one&apos;s geography.  At this time I would suggest 3rd limit JI is better than using the term &quot;Pythagor...etc.&quot; to describe the spiral of fifths tuning.  This was not a Greek enterprise (who theorized conceptually in tetrachord fourths as Iranians and Bulgarians do today).</p></div>
