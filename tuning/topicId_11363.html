Ironically, though, 2^Phi is actually very<br/>&gt;close to a perfect fifth, so scales constructed from fundamental<br/>&gt;acoustical intervals are, somewhat coincidentally, very close to the<br/>&gt;conceptual scales generated through abstract mathematics. (Or at least<br/>&gt;arithmetic).</p><p>&#x9;This depends on what you mean by &quot;these mathematical constructs.&quot;  If you<br/>mean: scales generated by the 2^phi generator, then you&apos;re right.  But the<br/>mathematical constructs I&apos;m concerned with include a 7-tone scale in a<br/>system of 12 interval categories, 2212221, or<br/>whole-whole-half-whole-whole-whole-half if you prefer, which you can find<br/>in the majority of western music and many non-western musics as well.<br/>Also, a 12-tone scale in a 12 category system (1111111111111): serialist<br/>music; a 5-t scale in a 12-c system (32332): important in Western folk and<br/>popular music; a 5-t in a 7-c system (21221): found in many Eastern musics.<br/>&#x9;2^phi is not particularly close to 3/2 (its about 39 c sharp).  You must<br/>be thinking of the Kornerup golden fifth which is about 6 c flat of the<br/>3/2.  The low numbered Kornerup MOS&apos;s look a lot like the MOS&apos;s of the pure<br/>5th.  In my system of interval categories they&apos;re equivalent.</p><p>&gt;Then there is a curious &quot;scale tree&quot; over in Anaphoria that looks like<br/>&gt;the beautiful bark of a large cut oak, with aging lines filled in with<br/>&gt;numbers.  I&apos;m guessing this all has to do with various scale<br/>&gt;generators... but am a little foggy yet here...</p><p>&#x9;Each node on the tree is a family of scales (MOS&apos;s).  The fractions (which<br/>represent generators) are logarithmic parts of an 8ve, which means, if the<br/>fraction is 4/7, then the interval is 4 steps of 7-tET.  For each fraction,<br/>reiterate the interval until you get a scale consisting of only 2 step<br/>sizes, and repeat the process until the numerators of each step are 1&apos;s and<br/>2&apos;s.  So, with 4/7:<br/>4, 3;  2, 2, 3;  2, 1, 2, 1, 1;  you can represent it this way also:</p><p>0 1 2 3 4 5 6<br/>0       4<br/>0   2   4<br/>0   2 3 4   6</p><p>&#x9;These scales are ET&apos;d approximations to scales on some infinite branch,<br/>such as the MOS&apos;s of the pure 5th, or Kornerup&apos;s 5th.</p><p>jason</p></div><h3>Paul H.
