I can now sing straight comma scales.  Did it for<br/>Joseph but he says he can&apos;t hear that finely.</p><p>Then I demonstrated commas on an alto recorder (for which I posted fingerings<br/>last year) and then I sang what I played.  It was easy to check because I<br/>first outlined the schisma by isolating the distinction between the equal<br/>tempered fifth and the perfect fifth.  Composer Alyssa Ryvers was visiting<br/>and she exclaimed, &quot;the cent is big!&quot;</p><p>Finally, I have been recording improvisations for composer Patrick Grant.  He<br/>tuned up a Kurtzweil synthesizer to single cent increments.  I sang along.<br/>Then I asked him to sing a long with me a cappella.  After resisting a bit<br/>(because it was uninteresting to him), he joined in and we easily began an<br/>ascent in single cents.</p><p>I do not think, with a bit of training, musicians with good pitch distinction<br/>could fail to appreciate single cents.</p><p>best, Johnny Reinhard</p></div>
