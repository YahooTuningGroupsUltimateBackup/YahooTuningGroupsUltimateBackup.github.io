Although, I&apos;m on<br/>the board of the AFMM, I really don&apos;t get paid to always say<br/>this... :)  Really it was spellbinding.  Although the piece was 70<br/>minutes long, it didn&apos;t seem long at all, and when I saw that the big<br/>score on the piano was nearing the end, I felt disappointed, rather<br/>than elated, as I usually do with long scores.</p><p>However, whether the piece can tolerate the &quot;full&quot; version rather<br/>than this &quot;abbreviated&quot; one is anybody&apos;s guess.  My feeling is that<br/>it was *exactly* the right length last night, and left people wanting<br/>more which, personally I believe should be one of the main objectives<br/>of any composition...</p><p>Anyway, I had a question about Michael Harrison&apos;s tuning, and Michael<br/>couldn&apos;t really seem to entirely answer it himself, so I turn again<br/>to the Tuning List.</p><p>Harrison likes pure Pythagorean fifths, and his tuning is built up<br/>from these, starting with a 1:1 on F, ergo:</p><p>F- 3:2 - C - 3:2 - G - 3:2 - D - 3:2 - A - 3:2 - E - 3:2 - B</p><p>Now he creates *another* string of just 702 cent fifths starting on<br/>Eb.  The relationship of this Eb to the 1:1 F is a just 7:4...</p><p>Then he goes on from that in just fifths on the &quot;black keys&quot;:</p><p>Eb - Bb - F# (actually, in this system Bb to F# is a pure 3:2) - C#<br/>and G#.</p><p>C to Bb is also 7:4, G to F# is 7:4, D to C# is 7:4 and A to G# is 7:4</p><p>Now my question is this:</p><p>Isn&apos;t this related in some way to the &quot;schismatic&quot; tunings we have<br/>discussed from time to time on this list?  Don&apos;t those tunings<br/>consist of strings of pure fifths superimposed on one another?</p><p>As I recall, the schismatic tuning had two such perfect, just fifth<br/>strings, and I believe they were transposed by a just 5:4, although<br/>my memory may be failing me... (and I know that Paul&apos;s won&apos;t... :)</p><p>ALSO,</p><p>Harrison only uses a 12-note tuning, with every octave the same.<br/>This makes notation a breeze, and the pianist just, well, plays... :)</p><p>But, this does limit a just intonation system rather severely, yes,<br/>with every octave having the same pitches??</p><p>Could somebody fill me in a bit.  That *has* to make a significant<br/>drawback as far as a &quot;pure&quot; just intonation system is concerned.</p><p>Or am I offbase on that?  Regardless, it really is a practical way to<br/>go.  I can&apos;t imagine a system with more than 12 notes on a<br/>conventional piano like this.  It seems one would need a specially<br/>designed instrument... (and a specially-designed *pianist*  :)</p><p>Thanks!</p><p>Joseph P.</p></div><h3>wallyesterpaulrus &#x3C;wallyesterpaulrus@yahoo.com&#x3E;</h3><span>4/27/2003 1:19:37 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;Joseph Pehrson&quot; &lt;jpehrson@r...&gt; wrote:</p><p>&gt; Harrison likes pure Pythagorean fifths, and his tuning is built up<br/>&gt; from these, starting with a 1:1 on F, ergo:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; F- 3:2 - C - 3:2 - G - 3:2 - D - 3:2 - A - 3:2 - E - 3:2 - B<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Now he creates *another* string of just 702 cent fifths starting on<br/>&gt; Eb.

I&apos;m suggesting that stretch applies only<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;when comparing pitches from the former, not the latter.<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt;there is no sharp boundary between the two. at what level of<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt;distortion do synthesized sine waves jump from one domain to the<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt;other?<br/>&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt;Both domains are always active.  Regardless of how the wave is<br/>&gt;&gt;represented in your synth, the ear will perform spectral analysis.<br/>&gt;&gt;The difference is ontological.  In the pure-tone experiment, the<br/>&gt;&gt;experimenter measures an interval between pure tones.  In the<br/>&gt;&gt;complex tone variation, he measures an interval between the roots<br/>&gt;&gt;of tones.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;i&apos;m still failing to see the &quot;ontological&quot; difference. there will<br/>&gt;always be some level of distortion present, creating overtones. so<br/>&gt;where does one domain give way to the other?</p><p>I don&apos;t understand what you&apos;re asking / don&apos;t know how to make my<br/>statement clearer.</p><p>&gt;&gt; As we know, it&apos;s very hard to deliver pure sines to the<br/>&gt;&gt; cochlea, anyway.
