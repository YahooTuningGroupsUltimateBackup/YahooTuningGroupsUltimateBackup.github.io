Actually, I personally<br/>&gt;find this a more persuasive argument for equal temperaments than &quot;it<br/>&gt;has a special sound of its own.&quot;</p><p>Me too. Another way of saying what Mats is saying, along the lines of<br/>periodicity blocks, is that ETs represent an infinite lattice with a finite<br/>number of notes. Meanwhile, they allow consonances to be connected in ways<br/>that JI doesn&apos;t allow (such as I-vi-ii-V-I or I-vi-IV-V-I progressions).</p></div>
