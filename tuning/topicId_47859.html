Understand, in my<br/>papers I pointed out in the 1970&apos;s that the solar-planetary<br/>system is not static but in motion, and spherical shapes<br/>and circular motions are what we observe in *outer*<br/>as well as *inner* space [the latter in micro-biological;<br/>and micro-mineral work, say in gem stones, leads us<br/>to your 14 and 28 or Keplers dodecahedral shapes, although<br/>there are others observed in emeralds, 6; and diamonds, 8,<br/>for instance. Nothing unusual in all this, except that<br/>astronomers and some astrophysicists *I-G-N-O-R-E* the<br/>observable data to the peril of their own work!</p><p>Bill<br/>Author of Arnold&apos;s Law<br/>========================================================</p><p>--- In <a href="mailto:cyclesi@yahoogroups.com">cyclesi@yahoogroups.com</a>, Ray Tomes &lt;rtomes@i...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt; Bill Arnold wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;I published Arnold&apos;s Law in 1979, as follows:<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;Bodies_Proportion___Degreed Arcs___Fraction___Ideal Mean**<br/>&gt; &gt;Or Perimeter<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;Sun__________0___________0________0____________0<br/>&gt; &gt;Mercury______1___________3_____1/120______3.14 X10(7th)miles<br/>&gt; &gt;Venus________2___________6______1/60______6.28<br/>&gt; &gt;Earth________3___________9______1/40______9.42<br/>&gt; &gt;Mars_________4__________12______1/30_____12.56<br/>&gt; &gt;Ceres*_______8__________24______1/15_____25.13<br/>&gt; &gt;Jupiter_____15__________45______1/8______47.12<br/>&gt; &gt;Saturn______30__________90______1/4______94.24<br/>&gt; &gt;Uranus______60_________180______1/2_____188.49<br/>&gt; &gt;Neptune_____90_________270______3/4_____282.74<br/>&gt; &gt;Pluto______120_________360______4/4_____376.99<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;*Ceres: prime representative of so-called &quot;asteroids&quot;<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;**means: adjusted for diameters of both bodies, sun and planet<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Hi Bill<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I came to the conclusion that the distances are similar to yours<br/>except<br/>&gt; that the outer ones are multiples of 14 or 28 rather than 15 or 30.<br/>This<br/>&gt; fits slightly better to the data, and also has the very important<br/>&gt; additional property of fitting the compositions of the planets.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; In the harmonics theory strong frequencies are typically related by<br/>the<br/>&gt; ratios 1:2:4:12 and we see this in the solar fusion process giving<br/>us<br/>&gt; the sequence H1--&gt;D2--&gt;He4 and later --&gt;C12 when the H is getting<br/>lower.<br/>&gt; The elements are also preferntially distributed with the H1 on the<br/>&gt; outside and the He4 on the inside. The same compositions apply to<br/>the<br/>&gt; giant planets which are on the larger orbit proportion. When we<br/>look at<br/>&gt; the Earth we find that the atmosphere is predominantly N14, the<br/>crust<br/>&gt; predominantly O16 and Si28 and the core predominantly Fe56. The 14-<br/>28-56<br/>&gt; sequence is the same as the 1-2-4 multiplies by 14 - exactly the<br/>same<br/>&gt; increase in frequency ratio as the increase in the frequency of the<br/>&gt; waves that explain the planets orbital locations. Furthermore, the<br/>&gt; frequencies of the waves that fit the planets orbits are also found<br/>in<br/>&gt; solar oscillations demonstrating the existence of them.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Regards<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Ray</p><p>__________________________________<br/>Do you Yahoo!?<br/>The New Yahoo!
