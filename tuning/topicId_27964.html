That could be what you are<br/>hearing. Varies from one voice to another.</p><p>You can get an alternative way of playing midi files for very little<br/>cost using the Yamaha Soft synth.

The tuning is pretty reasonable,<br/>I think accurate to about 0.5 cents or so (while my SB Live!<br/>is accurate to within 0.2 cents or so, with the absolute pitch<br/>also varying depending on the voice). It also has a little residual<br/>vibrato on its voices.</p><p>There are other soft synths too, a fair number; could be that others are better.<br/>Seems to me that a soft synth should be able to do the tuning as<br/>accurately as one likes, so I don&apos;t know why one would have as much<br/>variation as 0.5 cents; I would be interested to know if there are<br/>any that achieve a greater accuracy. But +-0.5 cents isn&apos;t bad for<br/>many of the example midi clips. It&apos;s not that easy to keep a note<br/>steady to the nearest cent while playing a real instrument.</p><p>The residual vibrato on some of the voices with modulation set to<br/>zero amounts to +- several cents on my soundcard, while others<br/>have hardly any, but a tiny amount that one can measure using<br/>wave counting.</p><p>That I could understand as possibly being something to do with<br/>the original sample that the waves are recorded with - perhaps<br/>the notes were played with slight vibrato when recorded. Just<br/>a guess.</p><p>(Some wave forms on my soundcard also have points<br/>where the two ends of the wave meet at a sharp angle,<br/>which one sees as a fluctuation in the frequency when wave<br/>counting).</p><p>Robert</p></div><h3>Latchezar Dimitrov &#x3C;latchezar_d@yahoo.com&#x3E;</h3><span>9/13/2001 10:36:54 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>John, hi again :)</p><p>Will try to respond you with...my english :)<br/>Excuse-me...</p><p> --- &quot;John A. deLaubenfels&quot; &lt;<a href="mailto:jdl@adaptune.com">jdl@adaptune.com</a>&gt; a<br/>&iuml;&iquest;&half;crit&iuml;&iquest;&half;: &gt; [Dimitrov wrote:]<br/>&gt; &gt;I try to think &quot;tunning&quot; like you just now...<br/>&gt; &gt;It&apos;s strange, but, ok.<br/>&gt; &gt;Dont have any words for the rest in english...<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I&apos;m sorry that I&apos;m unable to converse in any<br/>&gt; language but English!

Further, historical evidence is often if not<br/>always insufficient to reflect the realities of the times in<br/>question. Then we must take recourse to common sense and the larger<br/>human realities that tie us all together not just in space, but also<br/>in time.</p><p>It is difficult for me to imagine that with the freedom to choose<br/>just intervals available in musics dating from at least the early<br/>Renaissance if not further back, many of the evidently brilliant<br/>musical ears of the time did not naturally savor both harmonically<br/>and melodically the 4:5:6:7 ratios that some of us find so naturally<br/>enjoyable today.</p><p>We should ask ourselves how much of the objection to this today is a<br/>product of some kind of spurious intellection rather than a natural<br/>result of the &quot;musical economics&quot; and tradeoffs intrinsic to the<br/>psychoacoustic terrains through which we navigate. If we unbias our<br/>ears and simply deal innocently with the fundamental acoustic terrain<br/>that nature provides us in common with what it did centuries ago,<br/>perhaps we&apos;ll begin to sift out something closer to the historical<br/>realities.</p><p>I think we can learn something about the distortion of historical<br/>reality from our own recent history. Only a short time ago, the<br/>accepted academic view was that ancient music was performed at a much<br/>lower standard of quality than we have today. The &quot;primitive&quot; nature<br/>of the instruments, the frequent musical incompetence of the rare<br/>modern academics who specialized in playing them in those days, etc.,<br/>the relatively low standard of technical virtuosity in SOME of the<br/>music (not vocal, for sure, if we look at Monteverdi, for example)<br/>were factors contributing to this viewpoint. The modern early music<br/>revival has given the lie to all this.</p><p>On the contrary, common practice musicians of today have been lulled<br/>to sleep on intonation with the pervasive use of 12-tET and almost<br/>total relegation of fixed tuning to professionals. This has<br/>eliminated the need and even the option for most students of music to<br/>ever confront something so fundamental and historically well-<br/>understood as the syntonic comma. How many musicians of a random<br/>sample today would even know what that is?</p><p>So the relatively fine and unavoidable (microtonal) pitch anomolies<br/>that were a common, daily experience in days of yore are off map for<br/>most students of music today. That arrogant cultural chauvinism that<br/>assumed out of hand that we&apos;re superior in all things to what came<br/>before, or that a Paganini or Lizst having raised standards of<br/>technical virtuosity to new heights implies musical superiority in<br/>general, etc. was clearly out of kilter with reality.</p><p>I think we all know here that superior technical virtuousity together<br/>with a modern scientific and technologically advanced culture does<br/>not imply that singers are also better today or that we are deeper<br/>musically in any other way. Paganini and Liszt are among my least<br/>favorite composers. I personally find their music technical flashy<br/>and commensurately superficial. It is more about circus and less<br/>about music than say Josquin Des Prez.</p><p>And so it is with many other off-the-mark interpretations of<br/>historical evidence to which we here are not completely invulnerable.<br/>I think we need to pay more attention to the global considerations in<br/>piecing together historical evidence.</p><p>For example, we know that in western music harmony and melody<br/>interact polyphonically in ways that are fairly unique to this<br/>tradition. The melodic scales we use are FUNDAMENTALLY BASED on<br/>HARMONIC considerations. Even the essentially melodic traditions that<br/>use a drone, such as Indian classical music, use scales that are<br/>derived from whole number relationships. They are justly tuned to the<br/>drone. (Trash the 12-tET harmonium, please).</p><p>So all this erudite talk of melodic considerations forcing<br/>compromises in harmonic considerations is a source of wonder to me.<br/>Here I have seen the same people who rail against the tendency in<br/>&quot;expressive intonation&quot; to reverse the size relationship of the<br/>smaller just chromatic half-step and larger just diatonic half-step<br/>turn right around and promote analagous things with other and even<br/>the same intervals with the same kind of melodic &quot;justifications&quot;.</p><p>Without harmonic considerations and no drone, melodic intervals are<br/>completely arbitrary. I love the exotic flavors of melodic variety<br/>that essentially melodic traditions bring to the table. Finding ways<br/>to integrate them into a polyphonically workable framework using<br/>higher prime limits in JI fascinates me. I am fundamentally a singer,<br/>and I love melody! But I don&apos;t think we have to sacrifice what I<br/>experience personally as the awesome power of pure harmony in its<br/>service, and to pretend we do disturbs me.</p><p>Sincerely,</p><p>Bob</p><p>--- In tuning@y..., genewardsmith@j... wrote:<br/>&gt; --- In tuning@y..., &quot;Paul Erlich&quot; &lt;paul@s...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; Historically, musicians who attempted to introduce 7-limit into<br/>&gt; &gt; Western harmony did not think that it had anything to do with the<br/>&gt; &gt; dominant seventh chord -- even though they were unanimous that<br/>the<br/>&gt; 5-<br/>&gt; &gt; limit had much to do with the major chord.

It&apos;s &apos;logic&apos;<br/>&gt;therefore for them to raise for example the F# in the key of G.

I<br/>&gt;wonder why as well. OK, undeniable, the leading-tone (la note sensible)<br/>&gt;wants to go up to the tonic, but should we help it to make the move? On<br/>&gt;my quartertone guitar a leadingtone going up precisely a quartertone<br/>&gt;towards the tonic doesn&apos;t produce a dramatic result at all.

On a piano tuned to quarter<br/>comma mean tone temperament, there are different inversions<br/>of diminished seventh chords which a knowledgeable mean<br/>tone listener with a musical ear would distinguish naturally,<br/>although a modern listener might not immediately hear as<br/>intuitively obviously different and belonging in different places.<br/>    These chords, and also various just renditions of diminished<br/>seventh and other kinds of 7th chords, as well as the French<br/>Sixth chord, which has an intriguing 11- ratio interpretation,<br/>have a pleasing fascinating &quot;bite&quot; which, if they weren&apos;t<br/>fully exploited in earlier times, deserve to be explored<br/>as musical materials now.<br/>    I suspect that composers of the 17th and even 18th and<br/>perhaps early 19th centuries - even Chopin? - had first hand<br/>knowledge of the effects of the mean tone diminished 7th<br/>chords and may have intended these effects in some of their<br/>compositions.  The performance of their works in equal temperament<br/>would cause some of these effects - at least in their original<br/>form with the characteristic &quot;bite&quot; they had - to be lost.  It&apos;s<br/>frustrating that composers of those times said so little - at least<br/>as far as I know - about their thoughts on tuning and its effects<br/>on the sound of music.  However, I have some hopes that buried in<br/>libraries around Europe, there are old tomes and old newspapers going<br/>back well into the 18th century and perhaps earlier where some<br/>very telling insights might be gained by someone with the patience<br/>to go through mountains of old newspapers, journals, books, etc.</p><p>Dave Hill, Borrego Springs, CA</p></div><h3>graham@microtonal.co.uk</h3><span>9/16/2001 1:48:00 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p><a href="mailto:latchezar_d@yahoo.com">latchezar_d@yahoo.com</a> (=?iso-8859-1?q?Latchezar=20Dimitrov?=) wrote:</p><p>&gt; I&apos;m  tryng to guess if at any point of time anyone<br/>&gt; here has tried to think differently...<br/>&gt; Are you sure ( all of you :) ) that we must believe in<br/>&gt; the mathematic formulae and not in our own ears ?<br/>&gt; :))))<br/>&gt; Because it could be the opposite!

I<br/>&gt; don&apos;t think you should underrate the importance of the subdominant in<br/>&gt; CP.</p><p>ii is subdominant as well as IV.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Given the body of Renaissance music and the variety of diatonic folk<br/>&gt; music in<br/>&gt; &gt; various modes that uses triadic harmony, with no particular<br/>&gt; favoritism given to IV and V chords<br/>&gt; &gt; over others, I can&apos;t buy the Schoenbergian argument of &quot;genesis<br/>&gt; from I, IV, V&quot;.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I don&apos;t think the Renaissance defines &quot;common practice&quot;, in fact it<br/>&gt; used to be excluded from consideration.</p><p>You&apos;re right, but what I&apos;m saying is that diatonic<br/>scale plus triadic harmony does not imply<br/>common practice, until the tritone takes on an<br/>important cadential role. Only then do we see<br/>major and minor modes as more common or<br/>more important than the others. Otherwise, we<br/>see i IV v i in dorian, I IV v I in mixolydian, and<br/>plenty of other non-common-practice chord<br/>progressions.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; In any case, a<br/>&gt; &gt; free play of I, IV, and V sounds just as good to me in the<br/>&gt; Mixolydian and Dorian modes as it<br/>&gt; &gt; does in the Aeolian and Ionian modes -- the &quot;consistency&quot; in the<br/>&gt; triad qualities has no particular<br/>&gt; &gt; appeal -- and note that in common-practice minor, V usually becomes<br/>&gt; major instead of minor.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I think modal harmony sounds fine, but it isn&apos;t the core of CP by any<br/>&gt; means,</p><p>Exactly -- it&apos;s non-CP.</p><p>&gt;and I think that was driven by harmonic &gt;considerations.</p><p>Namely, the tritone. The tritone is disjoint from<br/>the tonic triad, and resolves to it by contrary<br/>motion, only in the major and minor modes. The<br/>harmonic minor scale, through the diminished<br/>seventh chord, allows two tritones to<br/>simultaneously resolve _in contrary motion_ to<br/>the tonic triad. These _linear_ (i.e., non-vertical)<br/>considerations here are at the heart of common<br/>practice harmony and how it works. See, for<br/>example, Allen Forte, _Tonal Harmony In<br/>Concept and Practice_.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; Oh, please. What about the fact that in major mode, you have<br/>&gt; major<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; tonic, dominant and subdoominant *chords*?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; It&apos;s a nice feature, but if it were very important, the major mode<br/>&gt; would probably have achieved<br/>&gt; &gt; prominence long before the use of guided tritone resolutions -- yet<br/>&gt; it didn&apos;t! The diatonic scale is<br/>&gt; &gt; so much more than this. At the very least, one can object to this<br/>&gt; set of ratios because there is no<br/>&gt; &gt; musical justification for &quot;demoting&quot; the ii chord below the vi and<br/>&gt; iii chords.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; It is certainly true that this does *not* fit CP, which gives ii more<br/>&gt; importance (as a fifth above the dominant more than as a third below<br/>&gt; the subdominant, but partly because it is the fulcrum of the comma<br/>&gt; pump bridging these two interpretations, I think) than iii or vi,<br/>&gt; which have fewer dynamic possibilities.</p><p>I don&apos;t understand this statement. What does not<br/>fit CP? And ii is _always_ a subdominant<br/>function -- a dominant of the dominant would be<br/>II or II7. Often, in Mozart for example, one can&apos;t<br/>distinguish ii from IV, because all the tones from<br/>both chords may be present, and one gets into<br/>questions of whether a certain note is a chord<br/>tone or a passing tone, etc . . . but one can say<br/>for sure that a subdominant harmony is at work.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;  In fact, some<br/>&gt; &gt; common-practice theorists view ii and vi as valid chord functions<br/>&gt; but iii is &quot;demoted&quot; -- clearly this<br/>&gt; &gt; has no correlation with the ratio-interpretation you propose.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I don&apos;t know what you mean by demoted--regarded as not a consonance?</p><p>Well there are many such theorists you could<br/>read . . . iii is often regarded as a non-existent<br/>harmonic function, and apparant occurences of<br/>the iii chord are explained in other ways, such as<br/>a V chord with a suspended 6th, just to give one<br/>possible example.</p><p>&gt; Given that it shares notes with both I and V, and bridges them, I<br/>&gt; don&apos;t see why that would be. It isn&apos;t regarded as very dynamic, or<br/>&gt; with much individual flavor. The vi goes to the relative minor, and<br/>&gt; ii has a dual role, but iii is pretty quiet.</p><p>Well that may be related about iii . . . but I don&apos;t<br/>think ii has a dual role, for any but overly<br/>mathematical JI theorists! Perceptually,<br/>musically, the ii chord is no more or less &quot;dual&quot;<br/>than any other chord, and its function is quite<br/>clear in a tonal context -- it&apos;s a subdominant.</p></div><h3>John A. deLaubenfels &#x3C;jdl@adaptune.com&#x3E;</h3><span>9/16/2001 3:57:21 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>[I wrote:]<br/>&gt;&gt;Gene, are you familiar with how my spring model works?

And often (usually) at an explicit<br/>&gt; harmonic price.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;(A conductor who wants a low C#, because it sounds<br/>&gt; out of tune against<br/>&gt; &gt;a low A, simply asks to play it as if it was a Db.)<br/>&gt;  It&apos;s &apos;logic&apos;<br/>&gt; &gt;therefore for them to raise for example the F# in<br/>&gt; the key of G. In the<br/>&gt; &gt;same time, musicians who play an instrument with<br/>&gt; flexible pitch, as the<br/>&gt; &gt;violin, always say that the F# is attracted toward<br/>&gt; the G and &apos;therefore<br/>&gt; &gt;should be sharpened&apos;.<br/>&gt;</p><p>No, dont agree :))<br/>Today  a conductor dont ask nothing :) We can play<br/>just without any help :))<br/>The phenomen is logic because nobody play the same<br/>frequence and in the result we have many choice ...</p><p>&gt; &gt;As Mr. Dimitrov says, as a violinist (!), why not<br/>&gt; &apos;normally&apos; distant? I<br/>&gt; &gt;wonder why as well. OK, undeniable, the<br/>&gt; leading-tone (la note sensible)<br/>&gt; &gt;wants to go up to the tonic, but should we help it<br/>&gt; to make the move? On<br/>&gt; &gt;my quartertone guitar a leadingtone going up<br/>&gt; precisely a quartertone<br/>&gt; &gt;towards the tonic doesn&apos;t produce a dramatic result<br/>&gt; at all. It sounds<br/>&gt; &gt;as if the note already half arrived and just needed<br/>&gt; to be tuned up a<br/>&gt; &gt;little. If there is something as an attraction<br/>&gt; force, something you<br/>&gt; &gt;lift up and than let it fall, perhaps a certain<br/>&gt; distance should be<br/>&gt; &gt;respected to produce an effect.<br/>&gt;</p><p>What guitar do you had say ? :))</p><p>&gt; I agree!  From your experience, 50 cents is too<br/>&gt; narrow.  Maybe the edge<br/>&gt; of a plausible and vivid (&quot;incisive&quot; is Paul E&apos;s<br/>&gt; term) minor second is<br/>&gt; around 70 cents (approximately 25:24).  As with so<br/>&gt; many musical issues,<br/>&gt; taste will vary.  I believe that Margo has said that<br/>&gt; she sometimes uses<br/>&gt; commas as melodic steps.  That&apos;s _narrow_!<br/>&gt;</p><p>Dont forget = we use vibrato also :))</p><p>&gt; &gt;Besides, a F# higher than in 12-tet will sound<br/>&gt; pretty much out of tune<br/>&gt; &gt;if played within a D or a D7. chord. So, I think I<br/>&gt; understand Mr.<br/>&gt; &gt;Dimitrov&apos;s question, but still can&apos;t give a<br/>&gt; definite reply.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Oh, absolutely.  As if major thirds weren&apos;t bad<br/>&gt; enough already!  I&apos;d<br/>&gt; rather let the step grow, and (as I stated) take a<br/>&gt; smaller step from the<br/>&gt; other half of the tritone.  Such an option is not,<br/>&gt; of course, possible<br/>&gt; in the more popular and historically accurate<br/>&gt; 5-limit tunings.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; JdL<br/>&gt;<br/>Would one time for alls understanding what&apos;s all of<br/>yours  X-limit&apos;s :))<br/>Pls !</p><p>Dimitrov</p><p>___________________________________________________________<br/>Do You Yahoo!? -- Un e-mail gratuit <a href="https://twitter.com/yahoo">@yahoo</a>.fr !<br/>Yahoo!

Thus the reference &quot;for new music&quot;.</p><p>How do you feel about the following example?  The Beatles cut from Sgt.<br/>Pepper, &quot;With a Little Help from My Friends.&quot;  Here&apos;s a song that&apos;s in<br/>2/4 time (or 4/4, depending on the construction of the measure), with<br/>a one male singer and the instrumentation of a rock&apos;n&apos;roll group.  Some<br/>time later, a version of this song came out, in 3/4 time (or 6/8, I have<br/>not seen the score), with several female voices doing harmony, different<br/>chords, different pretty much everything.  A total &quot;distortion&quot; of the<br/>original, if you will, far more &quot;egregious&quot; than altering the tuning of<br/>a dom 7th.</p><p>Is that cover &quot;inappropriate&quot;?  Something that one should not &quot;see fit&quot;<br/>to do, or even consider doing?  I happen to think it&apos;s not bad, though I<br/>prefer the original.  But even if I thought it sucked, isn&apos;t its musical<br/>value, or lack thereof, the important point, not its faithfulness to the<br/>composers&apos; vision?</p><p>I do not dispute the assertion that one should label one&apos;s alterations<br/>clearly.</p><p>Isn&apos;t this an important point, and shouldn&apos;t we apply the same standards<br/>to all music?  Why are past masters relegated to some kind of holy<br/>shrine, in which their works must never be touched, in some people&apos;s<br/>eyes?  IMHO, the best way to honor someone is to take bits of their<br/>work and reconstitute them in new ways.  When old works become museum<br/>pieces, they become brittle and eventually lost.

The melodic scales we use are FUNDAMENTALLY BASED on<br/>&gt; HARMONIC considerations.</p><p>Paul had replied:<br/>I completely disagree. The melodic scales we use derive from a time<br/>in our culture before harmony or polyphony were ever used. It is<br/>lucky that they turned out to lend themselves to harmony with only<br/>very minor modifications.</p><p>Bob answers:<br/>Well, if the way harmony and melody interact in our tradition is not<br/>fairly unique (thought &quot;fairly&quot; was a conservative term), then I&apos;d<br/>sure like to know about those traditions that are &quot;fairly close&quot; to<br/>us in that regard. And as in many melodic traditions, especially<br/>those that frequently use drones, even they had just relationships in<br/>their structure.</p><p>As you well know (but seem to be ignoring for the moment?), the times<br/>to which you refer used 3-limit JI, which is by definition<br/>harmonically derived even if they didn&apos;t conceive of it that way. The<br/>psychoacoustic basis for their prediliction for just fifths and<br/>fourths had no dependence on their being explicitly aware it.</p><p>This is an important point, and it bears on universals implicit in a<br/>common human perceptual metastructure INDEPENDENT of the age. This<br/>has nothing to do with imposing current aesthetics on another<br/>age!!!!!</p><p>Bob had also said:<br/>So all this erudite talk of melodic considerations forcing<br/>&gt; compromises in harmonic considerations is a source of wonder to me.<br/>&gt; Here I have seen the same people who rail against the tendency in<br/>&gt; &quot;expressive intonation&quot; to reverse the size relationship of the<br/>&gt; smaller just chromatic half-step and larger just diatonic half-step<br/>&gt; turn right around and promote analagous things with other and even<br/>&gt; the same intervals with the same kind of melodic &quot;justifications&quot;.</p><p>Paul had replied:<br/>Hmm?</p><p>Bob answers:<br/>What does &quot;Hmm&quot; mean? All of us familiar with JI know that the<br/>diatonic half-step is over half again as wide as the chromatic. Some<br/>of us have discussed at length and very critically the &quot;expressive<br/>intonation&quot; advocates who feel that leading tones want to be skinny<br/>and chromatic ones fat out of melodic considerations, and sometimes<br/>actually reverse the JI size relationship, going beyond their<br/>equalization by 12-tET. Yet I have seen threads here in which lesser<br/>inclinations in the same direction are vigorously promoted as<br/>melodically superior.</p><p>Paul had also replied:<br/>And to both you and Gene: the major and minor modes of the diatonic<br/>scale only relatively recently came to the fore. In older times, the<br/>Dorian, Phrygian, Lydian, and Mixolydian modes were more important.&gt;</p><p>Bob Answers:<br/>I think most, if not everyone even a little versed in the &quot;classical&quot;<br/>western tradition and the evolution of style from Gregorian chant<br/>into Renaissance polyphony and beyond is at least vaguely cognizant<br/>of this, to put it mildly! I savor the old modal flavors,<br/>polyphonically as well as melodically, and have played with them<br/>liberally, and even to some degree with historical allusions to<br/>compositional elements of the pre V-I cadential formulae such as the<br/>Landini cadence in what little dabbling I&apos;ve done in modern<br/>composition.</p><p>Bob had also said:<br/>&gt; Without harmonic considerations and no drone, melodic intervals are<br/>&gt; completely arbitrary.</p><p>Paul had replied:<br/>You don&apos;t think one can hear, and sing, with a fair degree of<br/>accuracy, the perfect fourth and fifth, melodically? Because that is<br/>all that is needed to construct the diatonic scale melodically. It<br/>has two identical tetrachords, a fourth or fifth apart, in _every_<br/>octave species.</p><p>Bob answers:<br/>Of course we can! I&apos;m frankly at a loss to find any relevance to my<br/>statements in this response, other than a &quot;perfect&quot; confirmation of<br/>them. The perfect fourth and fifth are wonderful cases in point in<br/>the argument for a harmonic basis underlying our melodic scales. What<br/>intervals are more consonant harmonically than these?!</p><p>My statement here only says that WITHOUT any harmonic basis or even a<br/>drone, there is no reason to choose such harmonic consonances over<br/>any other arbitrary sequence of pitches. Some ethnic melodic<br/>structures do not, and as long as they are melodic in this strictest<br/>of senses, why should they? They would simply be sacrificing an<br/>infinite potential for variation in melodic color with no harmonic<br/>advantages to show for it.</p><p>On the other hand, arguments that I&apos;ve run across here that there is<br/>some melodic disadvantage in the difference between 8:9 and 9:10<br/>whole steps in JI are totally puzzling to me. These intervals are<br/>both stepwise and sequential in the harmonic series and differ by<br/>only a microtonal comma! Their SLIGHTLY unequal division of the major<br/>3rd is no different in principle from the division of the fifth into<br/>major and minor thirds. Are we getting into some kind of melodic<br/>&quot;princess and the pea&quot; syndrome here?</p><p>By contrast some absolutely beautiful middle eastern scales use<br/>augmented seconds in alternation with diatonic half and whole steps<br/>to create gorgeous melodic color in the absence of any significant<br/>harmonic structure. Nevertheless, even these have their harmonic<br/>derivations usually, if not always, even if they sometimes invoke the<br/>use of higher primes.</p><p>Paul had also replied:<br/>Bob, I think it&apos;s very important to sit down and read the aesthetic<br/>opinions of musicians of the period in question, rather than impose<br/>our own aesthetics upon their music.</p><p>Bob answers:<br/>I don&apos;t think either Gene or I are promoting the imposition of our<br/>easthetics upon another time. I believe we are both saying something<br/>quite different. There are certain universals that apply to both<br/>physical and psychoacoustics that are behind the demonstrable<br/>preoccupation of cultures with the mathematics of music involving<br/>whole number relationships between frequencies (in our terms, or<br/>inversely, string lengths in theirs) over thousands of years.</p><p>Historical evidence must always be placed in the context of other<br/>elements of reality, such as our observation that water runs<br/>downhill. There are things about history we could not conclude from<br/>the evidence if we didn&apos;t know that certain things remain common to<br/>the physical universe in which we all have have lived, independent of<br/>when we lived.</p><p>Often the historical evidence is ambiguous or inconclusive without<br/>these considerations as a foundation for their interpretation. They<br/>then become the fundamental context without which the historical<br/>evidence would have no meaning.</p><p>There are even times when our conclusions rest less on physical and<br/>more on emotional or psychological commonalities that remain<br/>relatively stable over millenia. This is less reliable, but sometimes<br/>still necessary. And then there is the elusive element of good old<br/>common sense and deeper human insight. Of course, who has and doesn&apos;t<br/>have these becomes a very difficult issue to resolve.</p></div><h3>Paul Erlich &#x3C;paul@stretch-music.com&#x3E;</h3><span>9/17/2001 8:05:51 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In tuning@y..., &quot;John A. deLaubenfels&quot; &lt;jdl@a...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt; [Paul E wrote:]<br/>&gt; &gt;Playing and listening are primary . .<br/>&gt; &gt;. mathematics can only be a tool, and our models<br/>&gt; &gt;are never perfect . . . so one must always listen<br/>&gt; &gt;with a true and open heart, and with lots of<br/>&gt; &gt;patience (old habits die hard), and with<br/>&gt; &gt;knowledge of the testimonials of musicians of<br/>&gt; &gt;past generations.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Agreed on all counts.

There have been a few examples, though, in the strict-JI<br/>renditions of Western music I&apos;ve heard . . . have you heard any?</p><p>&gt; By contrast some absolutely beautiful middle eastern scales use<br/>&gt; augmented seconds in alternation with diatonic half and whole steps<br/>&gt; to create gorgeous melodic color in the absence of any significant<br/>&gt; harmonic structure.</p><p>Yup!</p><p> Nevertheless, even these have their harmonic<br/>&gt; derivations usually, if not always, even if they sometimes invoke<br/>the<br/>&gt; use of higher primes.</p><p>I dispute these derivations. You can describe any conceivable scale<br/>in terms of higher primes, but that doesn&apos;t constitute<br/>a &quot;derivation&quot;. You have to show that the scale was somehow<br/>influenced by these particular higher primes, as opposed to some<br/>simpler hypothesis (such as a random &quot;frozen accident&quot; hypothesis).</p><p>&gt; are certain universals that apply to both<br/>&gt; physical and psychoacoustics that are behind the demonstrable<br/>&gt; preoccupation of cultures with the mathematics of music involving<br/>&gt; whole number relationships between frequencies (in our terms, or<br/>&gt; inversely, string lengths in theirs) over thousands of years.</p><p>Most cultures have not been so preoccupied. But I&apos;m mostly on your<br/>side about psychoacoustics being relevant to music . . . compared<br/>with the nutty professor (great movie, just watched it).</p><p>&gt; Historical evidence must always be placed in the context of other<br/>&gt; elements of reality, such as our observation that water runs<br/>&gt; downhill. There are things about history we could not conclude from<br/>&gt; the evidence if we didn&apos;t know that certain things remain common to<br/>&gt; the physical universe in which we all have have lived, independent<br/>of<br/>&gt; when we lived.</p><p>There&apos;s a long, long, long, long jump between our understanding of<br/>the physical universe and our understanding of past musical practice.</p><p>&gt; Often the historical evidence is ambiguous or inconclusive without<br/>&gt; these considerations as a foundation for their interpretation. They<br/>&gt; then become the fundamental context without which the historical<br/>&gt; evidence would have no meaning.</p><p>True.</p></div><h3>genewardsmith@juno.com</h3><span>9/18/2001 1:12:20 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In tuning@y..., &quot;Paul Erlich&quot; &lt;paul@s...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt; Agreed . . . but harmonically derived?

I would posit that this<br/>great power is harmonic in nature in the most FUNDAMENTAL sense.</p><p>If you assume that the third harmonic is so prominent in some timbres<br/>that this qualifies the fourths and fifths as fundamentally melodic,<br/>I would humbly submit that this is a kind of useless, even<br/>counterproductive semantic play. These HARMONICS and any other of the<br/>lower ones, as I cannot imagine you would fail to agree, form a<br/>basis at a very FUNDAMENTAL level for harmonic structure in music.</p><p>I would further posit that the often, even usually UNCONSCIOUS<br/>preference of the human ear for these relationships melodically or<br/>otherwise has its basis in their HARMONIC power, independent of when<br/>harmony began to evolve as a consciously recognized component of<br/>musical structure.</p><p>Why don&apos;t we ask ourselves on what basis harmony began to evolve in<br/>the first place? Surely no one thinks it was purely random<br/>happenstance with no physical or psychoacoustic basis whatsoever.<br/>Whether a particular culture was consciously aware of harmony or<br/>harmonic considerations of any kind is utterly beside the point from<br/>the fundmental perspective of the time- and culture-independent<br/>physical acoustic and psychoacoustic phenomena to which I refer.</p><p>As I have stated before in other threads, there is another side to<br/>harmonic relationships that I have personally and empirically found<br/>to be more powerful and reliable by far than the intuitive perception<br/>of harmonic overtones in musical timbres. The harmonically (make that<br/>also coherently) related DIFFERENCE PRODUCTS of justly related tones<br/>are incredibly powerful tools for developing the intuitive<br/>recognition of just intervals.</p><p>In the case of the perfect fifth, the primary difference product is<br/>an octave below the lower note of the interval. This is by far the<br/>simplest, most intimate, and most powerful relationship that can<br/>exist bewtween any two harmonically related tones.</p><p>In my humble opinion and quite a lot of significant evidence, this is<br/>a timeless universal that has both a physical and neurological basis.<br/>The physical basis is well-understood in electronics and analog<br/>signal processing. It has nothing to with imposing the aesthetics of<br/>one culture on another. And it does NOT represent, as you seem to<br/>declare, either a physical OR a neurological reality that is &quot;a long,<br/>long way from past musical practice&quot;.</p><p>Let&apos;s try to get past academic nit-picking and be practical. A lot of<br/>music history is a record of practice and practical musical<br/>considerations.

If<br/>&gt;&gt; it is not based<br/>&gt;&gt; on harmonic partials and it&apos;s not based on<br/>&gt;&gt; difference products, what<br/>&gt;&gt; is it based on, magic?<br/>&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt; Even melodies do not usually live in a total<br/>&gt;&gt; harmonic vacuum. There<br/>&gt;&gt; is the overlapping melodic imitation common to many<br/>&gt;&gt; traditions. At<br/>&gt;&gt; least an occasional use of drones is also quite<br/>&gt;&gt; common and sometimes<br/>&gt;&gt; perpetual, as in Indian classical music and some<br/>&gt;&gt; middle-eastern, as<br/>&gt;&gt; well as some early Greek Orthodox and other eastern<br/>&gt;&gt; Christian music.<br/>&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt; You seem to restrict your definition of harmony to<br/>&gt;&gt; its explicit<br/>&gt;&gt; presence in music?...its conscious use and<br/>&gt;&gt; cultivation...?...? I find<br/>&gt;&gt; this an arbitrary and powerful dilution of<br/>&gt;&gt; explanatory power in<br/>&gt;&gt; understanding musical evolution and the how and why<br/>&gt;&gt; of harmonic music<br/>&gt;&gt; ever having evolved in the first place.<br/>&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt; The acquisition of spoken language in children used<br/>&gt;&gt; to be modeled in<br/>&gt;&gt; terms of behavioristic conditioning theory. Now<br/>&gt;&gt; research has<br/>&gt;&gt; irrefutably demonstrated that this is a totally<br/>&gt;&gt; inadequate model. It<br/>&gt;&gt; is now well recognized that the MAJOR portion of<br/>&gt;&gt; language acquisition<br/>&gt;&gt; is based on the unconscious use of the human<br/>&gt;&gt; intuition implicit in<br/>&gt;&gt; the brain&apos;s own internal structure. Music is also a<br/>&gt;&gt; language!<br/>&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt; Paul:<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt; These combinational tones are only possible when<br/>&gt;&gt; harmony (that is,<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt; simultaneous sounding of tones) is being used (and<br/>&gt;&gt; at a loud<br/>&gt;&gt; volume).<br/>&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt; Bob:<br/>&gt;&gt; Wrong! They are subtle at first, but later clearly<br/>&gt;&gt; audible to ears<br/>&gt;&gt; trained to listen for them. They are hidden from us<br/>&gt;&gt; at first by a<br/>&gt;&gt; psychogical phenomenon known as masking, as are any<br/>&gt;&gt; phenomena that<br/>&gt;&gt; are perpetually there, especially if they&apos;re not<br/>&gt;&gt; primary to the<br/>&gt;&gt; initial sonic objects that generate our aural<br/>&gt;&gt; experience. Ever notice<br/>&gt;&gt; how loud harmonic partials are once you learn to<br/>&gt;&gt; pick them out with<br/>&gt;&gt; your ear? Yet you won&apos;t have much trouble finding<br/>&gt;&gt; people, musicians<br/>&gt;&gt; included, who fail to hear them no matter how they<br/>&gt;&gt; try.<br/>&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt; Granted, even then once you&apos;re actually performing<br/>&gt;&gt; music instead of<br/>&gt;&gt; sitting on sustained harmonies, explicit recognition<br/>&gt;&gt; of the<br/>&gt;&gt; difference products is not easy, and per se they are<br/>&gt;&gt; not at the<br/>&gt;&gt; forefront of the hearing experience. Nevertheless,<br/>&gt;&gt; having made them<br/>&gt;&gt; explicit under ideal conditions develops an<br/>&gt;&gt; intuitive sensitivity to<br/>&gt;&gt; their underlying presence that is unmistakably clear<br/>&gt;&gt; and reliable.<br/>&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt; Having heard them explicitly leaves their indelible<br/>&gt;&gt; &quot;footprint&quot; in<br/>&gt;&gt; the mind&apos;s ear so that even when they are not<br/>&gt;&gt; explicit, their mark is<br/>&gt;&gt; clearly recognizable in the same way as timbre is<br/>&gt;&gt; appreciated without<br/>&gt;&gt; necessarily noticing its constituent partials and<br/>&gt;&gt; other relevant<br/>&gt;&gt; subcomponents, such as subtleties of attack and<br/>&gt;&gt; delay, timbre shifts,<br/>&gt;&gt; etc.<br/>&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt; When I first founded Cantus Angelicus, we were a few<br/>&gt;&gt; weeks away from<br/>&gt;&gt; our first concert and the intonation was way under<br/>&gt;&gt; par for anything I<br/>&gt;&gt; wanted to be associated with.

I don&apos;t think there was any such tendency for<br/>diatonic melodies to be &quot;heard&quot; as major before the advent of common-<br/>practice harmony. Yet one hears again and again the derivation of the<br/>diatonic scale in terms of harmonic partials over roots on I, IV, and<br/>V . . . totally anachronistic, IMO.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I think that it should be clear from this that to speak of such a<br/>&gt; metastucture does NOT have to imply spurious means to justify an<br/>&gt; &quot;anything goes&quot; approach to drawing conclusions from historical<br/>&gt; evidence.</p><p>I don&apos;t understand this sentence.</p><p>&gt; A greater peril lies in ignoring that such a metastructure<br/>&gt; does indeed exist</p><p>That&apos;s exactly what I fear many JI thinkers, and perhaps you, are<br/>doing!

Now<br/>&gt; &gt; research has<br/>&gt; &gt; irrefutably demonstrated that this is a totally<br/>&gt; &gt; inadequate model. It<br/>&gt; &gt; is now well recognized that the MAJOR portion of<br/>&gt; &gt; language acquisition<br/>&gt; &gt; is based on the unconscious use of the human<br/>&gt; &gt; intuition implicit in<br/>&gt; &gt; the brain&apos;s own internal structure.

They are subtle at first, but later clearly<br/>&gt; &gt; audible to ears<br/>&gt; &gt; trained to listen for them. They are hidden from us<br/>&gt; &gt; at first by a<br/>&gt; &gt; psychogical phenomenon known as masking, as are any<br/>&gt; &gt; phenomena that<br/>&gt; &gt; are perpetually there, especially if they&apos;re not<br/>&gt; &gt; primary to the<br/>&gt; &gt; initial sonic objects that generate our aural<br/>&gt; &gt; experience. Ever notice<br/>&gt; &gt; how loud harmonic partials are once you learn to<br/>&gt; &gt; pick them out with<br/>&gt; &gt; your ear? Yet you won&apos;t have much trouble finding<br/>&gt; &gt; people, musicians<br/>&gt; &gt; included, who fail to hear them no matter how they<br/>&gt; &gt; try.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; Granted, even then once you&apos;re actually performing<br/>&gt; &gt; music instead of<br/>&gt; &gt; sitting on sustained harmonies, explicit recognition<br/>&gt; &gt; of the<br/>&gt; &gt; difference products is not easy, and per se they are<br/>&gt; &gt; not at the<br/>&gt; &gt; forefront of the hearing experience. Nevertheless,<br/>&gt; &gt; having made them<br/>&gt; &gt; explicit under ideal conditions develops an<br/>&gt; &gt; intuitive sensitivity to<br/>&gt; &gt; their underlying presence that is unmistakably clear<br/>&gt; &gt; and reliable.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; Having heard them explicitly leaves their indelible<br/>&gt; &gt; &quot;footprint&quot; in<br/>&gt; &gt; the mind&apos;s ear so that even when they are not<br/>&gt; &gt; explicit, their mark is<br/>&gt; &gt; clearly recognizable in the same way as timbre is<br/>&gt; &gt; appreciated without<br/>&gt; &gt; necessarily noticing its constituent partials and<br/>&gt; &gt; other relevant<br/>&gt; &gt; subcomponents, such as subtleties of attack and<br/>&gt; &gt; delay, timbre shifts,<br/>&gt; &gt; etc.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; When I first founded Cantus Angelicus, we were a few<br/>&gt; &gt; weeks away from<br/>&gt; &gt; our first concert and the intonation was way under<br/>&gt; &gt; par for anything I<br/>&gt; &gt; wanted to be associated with. I went home and<br/>&gt; &gt; brainstormed on how I<br/>&gt; &gt; extend the use of the difference products so<br/>&gt; &gt; prominent in double-<br/>&gt; &gt; stopping just intervals on the violin to exercises<br/>&gt; &gt; that would be time-<br/>&gt; &gt; efficient and work for voices.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; I played with sustained tones on my synth and my own<br/>&gt; &gt; voice and cooked<br/>&gt; &gt; up something that would involve all four voice parts<br/>&gt; &gt; together. I took<br/>&gt; &gt; the synth to the next rehearsal and tried the<br/>&gt; &gt; exercises. The results<br/>&gt; &gt; were nothing short of miraculous! I would have never<br/>&gt; &gt; predicted the<br/>&gt; &gt; power they would have!<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; Within three rehearsals using the exercises only for<br/>&gt; &gt; a few minutes at<br/>&gt; &gt; the beginning, we had a totally different choir. One<br/>&gt; &gt; member who was<br/>&gt; &gt; aloso involved in another singing group got me an<br/>&gt; &gt; invitation to help<br/>&gt; &gt; them. They were truly awful when I walked in. Much<br/>&gt; &gt; worse than our<br/>&gt; &gt; choir had ever been. In three sessions they were<br/>&gt; &gt; singing<br/>&gt; &gt; unrecognizably beautiful harmony. Even after the<br/>&gt; &gt; first session, they<br/>&gt; &gt; were floored with the results. I was, too!<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; I had doubts, though, about how that would last,<br/>&gt; &gt; since I didn&apos;t have<br/>&gt; &gt; any further contact after the three sessions.

Now for a dominant seventh chord to be<br/>4:5:6:7, D and F would have to form a 6:7 ratio, a kind of minor<br/>third about 50 cents narrower than the &quot;usual&quot; one. Though we find<br/>all kinds of microtonal pitch problems/adjustments discussed in the<br/>literature of this era, this is not one of them. Considering that D<br/>and F were often held over from a previous sonority, you&apos;d expect at<br/>least _some_ mention of some kind of effect, and perhaps an attempt<br/>to capture it on a microtonal keyboard, etc., if 4:5:6:7 was in fact<br/>used for the dominant seventh chord. As far as I know, those<br/>_musicians_ who did in fact experiment with ratios of 7 (such as<br/>Tartini and Kirnberger) suggested that they be added to our musical<br/>resources in various ways, but none suggested that they had anything<br/>to do with the existing practice of the dominant seventh chord, or<br/>that they be adopted as for providing improved or alternative<br/>versions of the dominant seventh chord.</p><p>I&apos;d suggest Easley Blackwood&apos;s book _The Structure of Recognizable<br/>Diatonic Tunings_ for more.</p></div><h3>BobWendell@technet-inc.com</h3><span>9/20/2001 3:01:21 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Paul said:<br/>I&apos;m very happy for your successes in training choirs in intonation,<br/>&gt; and believe that difference tones produced by _simultaneous_<br/>pitches<br/>&gt; may have a lot to do with that.

You can<br/>understand why this is so with a little math (see, for example, the<br/>Feynman Lectures in Physics). So if you decrease the amplitudes of<br/>the singers by, say, a factor of 10 (10dB), the majority of the<br/>combinational tones will decrease in amplitude by at least a factor<br/>of 100 (20 dB). That means that they will fall below the limen of<br/>audibility much faster than the sung tones will.</p><p>But there is an exception. One of the second-order combinational<br/>tones (2x-y) appears to maintain audibility even when the input tones<br/>are rather quiet, and the relationship with amplitude is much flatter<br/>than a square law (let alone the cubic law you would expect for a<br/>second-order difference tone).

Neither life or non-<br/>life...</p><p>Is it possible that Medieval &quot;harmony&quot; is something essentially<br/>*between* melody and harmony???</p><p>Just a thought...??</p><p>Certainly, though, just because a *structure* is made out of<br/>a chain of simultaneous diads, making &quot;harmony&quot; doesn&apos;t mean that the<br/>fundamental basis of the music is &quot;harmonic&quot; if it&apos;s not used that<br/>way...</p><p>???</p><p>_________ _______ _______<br/>Joseph Pehrson</p></div><h3>mschulter &#x3C;MSCHULTER@VALUE.NET&#x3E;</h3><span>9/22/2001 6:39:21 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Hello, there, Joseph Pehrson.</p><p>While the topic of Renaissance diatonicism is one inviting many lines<br/>of discussion, for example the question of modality in its horizontal<br/>and vertical aspects, one starting point for my viewpoints on some of<br/>the issues you raise might be my recent post in response to the<br/>&quot;7-limit&quot; and related threads:</p><p><a href="http://groups.yahoo.com/group/tuning/message/28404">http://groups.yahoo.com/group/tuning/message/28404</a></p><p>Again, I consider these very important questions, and would much<br/>welcome further dialogue.</p><p>Most appreciatively,</p><p>Margo Schulter<br/><a href="mailto:mschulter@value.net">mschulter@value.net</a></p></div><h3>jpehrson@rcn.com</h3><span>9/22/2001 6:52:56 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In tuning@y..., mschulter &lt;MSCHULTER@V...&gt; wrote:</p><p><a href="http://groups.yahoo.com/group/tuning/message/28463">http://groups.yahoo.com/group/tuning/message/28463</a></p><p>&gt; Hello, there, Joseph Pehrson.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; While the topic of Renaissance diatonicism is one inviting many<br/>lines of discussion, for example the question of modality in its<br/>horizontal and vertical aspects, one starting point for my viewpoints<br/>on some of the issues you raise might be my recent post in response<br/>to the &quot;7-limit&quot; and related threads:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; <a href="http://groups.yahoo.com/group/tuning/message/28404">http://groups.yahoo.com/group/tuning/message/28404</a><br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Again, I consider these very important questions, and would much<br/>&gt; welcome further dialogue.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Most appreciatively,<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Margo Schulter<br/>&gt; mschulter@v...</p><p>Thank you very much, Margo!

Since some composers from<br/>Perotin to Machaut use this sonority prominently, Jacobus may be<br/>giving us a clue to their outlook.</p><p>The &quot;collection&quot; idea can also apply to multi-voice progressions,<br/>which often can nicely be derived by superimposing or &quot;stacking&quot;<br/>elementary two-voice progressions.</p><p>I discuss this kind of approach at some length -- using symbols like<br/>8/5, by the way, to show a &quot;figured bass&quot; kind of notation for<br/>sonorities (e.g. octave and fifth in relation to the lowest note)<br/>rather than tuning ratios -- at</p><p><a href="http://www.medieval.org/emfaq/harmony/13c.html">http://www.medieval.org/emfaq/harmony/13c.html</a><br/><a href="http://www.medieval.org/emfaq/harmony/pyth.html">http://www.medieval.org/emfaq/harmony/pyth.html</a></p><p>The idea of stable trines, unstable &quot;collections&quot; with various degrees<br/>of concord or discord, and also collections of two-voice progressions<br/>united to form satisfying directed cadences for three and four voices,<br/>stands in contrast either to the idea of &quot;harmony&quot; in an 18th-century<br/>sense, or to a texture based on isolated melodic lines or dyads.</p><p>In 20th-century terms, we have what Ludmilla Ulehla has called a<br/>texture based on &quot;intervallic structures&quot; -- structures built from<br/>diverse types of dyads, with both sometimes subtle degrees of vertical<br/>tension and melodic shapes playing a vital role.</p><p>This is a brief statement, but I hope a not unhelpful one of my basic<br/>outlook.</p><p>As always, more questions and dialogue are very warmly invited and<br/>encouraged; these are very important topics.</p><p>Most appreciatively,</p><p>Margo Schulter<br/><a href="mailto:mschulter@value.net">mschulter@value.net</a></p></div><h3>klaus schmirler &#x3C;KSchmir@z.zgs.de&#x3E;</h3><span>9/23/2001 3:53:41 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>mschulter schrieb:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Hello, there, Joseph Pehrson.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; While the topic of Renaissance diatonicism is one inviting many lines<br/>&gt; of discussion, for example the question of modality in its horizontal<br/>&gt; and vertical aspects, one starting point for my viewpoints on some of<br/>&gt; the issues you raise might be my recent post in response to the<br/>&gt; &quot;7-limit&quot; and related threads:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; <a href="http://groups.yahoo.com/group/tuning/message/28404">http://groups.yahoo.com/group/tuning/message/28404</a><br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Again, I consider these very important questions, and would much<br/>&gt; welcome further dialogue.</p><p>wrong guy responding :)</p><p>I wasn&apos;t conscious of the division-of-the-fifth principle being<br/>applied to fifthless inversions, even though I must have read<br/>this post previously.</p><p>Could it be that it is necessary to distiguish much more<br/>strictly (than I did so far) between vocal and instrumental<br/>music?</p><p>In vocal polyphony the tenor-cantus frame prevails and<br/>determines the cadences, using the old clausulae in the<br/>appropriate voices.

Here I will look both to Zarlino, and to such contemporaries as<br/>Vicentino and Santa Maria.</p><p>------------------------------------<br/>1. Zarlino on divisions of the sixth<br/>------------------------------------</p><p>First, I should clarify that Zarlino discusses what I have termed<br/>divisions of the sixth -- e.g. G3-C4-E4 (major sixth, fourth, major<br/>third) or E3-G3-C4 (minor sixth, minor third, fourth) -- in the<br/>context of some rules and suggestions for the treatment of the fourth<br/>in writing for three or more voices.</p><p>His famous comparison of the divisions of the fifth -- the harmonic<br/>(e.g. F3-A3-C4) or arithmetic (e.g. A3-C4-E4) -- take a similar<br/>approach, but with an important difference.</p><p>With the fifth, Zarlino finds the harmonic division with a<br/>string-ratio of 15:12:10, the 5:4 major third below and the 6:5 minor<br/>third above, as the &quot;natural&quot; division; and the arithmetic division of<br/>6:5:4, with the converse arrangement of the thirds, as &quot;artificial&quot;<br/>and somewhat less ideally concordant.</p><p>Here is a diagram showing that the differences between terms in the<br/>first division with the major third below have the same ratio (3:2) as<br/>the outer terms, while in the second division we have an arithmetic<br/>proportion with equal differences between adjacent terms:</p><p>      F3    A3    C4              A3    C4    E4<br/>      15    12    10              6     5     4<br/>         3     2                     1     1</p><p>In his discussion of the three-voice divisions featuring the fourth,<br/>however -- those with an outer major or minor sixth -- he could not<br/>consistently use this test for all the combinations he discusses. In<br/>his approach, he instead takes a more general view in determining<br/>which sonorities are &quot;natural&quot; (more euphonious) or &quot;artificial&quot;<br/>(somewhat less euphonious than their &quot;natural&quot; counterparts).</p><p>Interestingly, with the major sixth, we could use the kind of<br/>harmonic/arithmetic contrast Zarlino applies to the divisions of the<br/>fifth in order to reach his result that the string ratio of 20:15:12<br/>(fourth below major third) is more harmonious than 20:16:12 (converse<br/>arrangement):</p><p>      G3    C4    E4              G3    B3    E4<br/>      20    15    12              20    16    12<br/>          5     3                     4     4</p><p>However, with the division of the 8:5 minor sixth into 6:5 minor third<br/>and 4:3 fourth, this approach would not apply, since neither<br/>arrangement is a harmonic or arithmetic division:</p><p>      A3    C4    F4              A3    D4    F4<br/>      24    20    15              24    18    15<br/>         4     5                     6     3</p><p>In neither division do we find either that the differences between<br/>adjacent terms have the same proportion as the extreme terms (8:5), or<br/>that these differences are equal.</p><p>For the divisions of the sixth involving the fourth, Zarlino instead<br/>uses the order of the &quot;sonorous numbers&quot; or senario as a criterion to<br/>judge the more pleasing arrangements of these sonorities:</p><p>C5-----<br/>       |<br/>G4     | 8:5<br/>   6:5 |<br/>E4------<br/>   5:4<br/>C4<br/>   4:3<br/>G3<br/>   3:2<br/>C3<br/>   2:1<br/>C2</p><p>Thus he finds that in this series of ratios the 4:3 fourth occurs _below_<br/>the 5:4 major third -- as in G3-C4-E4; while the 6:5 minor third<br/>occurs _below_ the 4:3 fourth in E4-G4-C5. The latter sonority with<br/>its 8:5 minor sixth is actually outside the senario proper, but is<br/>included by Zarlino so that both major and minor sixths may be<br/>represented.</p><p>Here I wish to clarify that Zarlino does not apply the concept of the<br/>harmonic and arithmetic divisions of the fifth to sonorities with no<br/>fifth -- the saturated consonances dividing a sixth into a fourth and<br/>third -- but draws an analogous kind of &quot;natural/artificial&quot;<br/>contrast based on the intervals present in these sonorities.</p><p>Along with Dahlhaus, I would emphasize that we must look to the<br/>expansive or contractive character of intervals as well as what<br/>Zarlino terms the &quot;natural&quot; or &quot;artificial&quot; qualities of a sonority.</p><p>Thus F3-A3-D4 is at once &quot;artificial&quot; in its arrangement of the major<br/>third below and fourth below -- an arrangement opposite to that found<br/>in the senario -- and &quot;expansive&quot; in the quality of the major third<br/>and major sixth, which seek the fifth and octave respectively.</p><p>Both for the divisions of the fifth, and for the divisions of the<br/>sixth into fourth and third, Zarlino is seeking to distinguish between<br/>the more and less harmonious arrangements. I hope that this discussion<br/>may clarify the distinction between his harmonic/arithmetic contrast<br/>and his more general natural/artificial contrast.</p><p>For the divisions of the fifth and major sixth, one could take either<br/>approach; for the minor sixth, only the latter approach applies in<br/>this 16th-century setting.</p><p>(In a 21st-century setting, one might consider for example an<br/>arithmetic division of 8:5 into a string ratio of 16:13:10.)</p><p>----------------------------------------------------------<br/>2. Two-voice clausulae in 16th-century theory and practice<br/>----------------------------------------------------------</p><p>Certainly I would agree with Dahlhaus and others that traditional<br/>two-voice cadential formulae, or _clausulae_ in this 16th-century<br/>sense, often guide multi-voice textures, and also that the<br/>tenor-superius pair often holds this guiding progression.</p><p>At the same time, I would emphasize both the mixture of old and new<br/>two-voice cadences, both types presented by Zarlino, and the emphasis<br/>on theorists such as Vicentino as well as Santa Maria on the role of<br/>the bass or bass-superius pair.</p><p>In addition to some distinctions between vocal and more informal<br/>instrumental styles (e.g. dances), we might find distinctions between<br/>vocal writing in a more elaborate or formal contrapuntal style, and<br/>writing in the kind of &quot;familiar&quot; or note-against-note style featured<br/>in sources such as the Cancionero de Palacio around 1500, as well as<br/>later in the 16th century.</p><p>Since it has been commented that Spanish songs of the kind I am<br/>describing often use dancelike patterns, and sometimes dance melodies,<br/>we might look for various connections between such related styles.</p><p>From the tenor-superius viewpoint, a cadence like the following might<br/>be viewed as a four-voice harmonization of the M6-8 _clausula_ found<br/>in the two principal voices, moving from the major sixth E4-C#5 to the<br/>octave D4-D5:</p><p>        C#5  D5<br/>        A4   A4<br/>        E4   D4<br/>        A3   D3</p><p>By the time of Vicentino and Zarlino, however, another element has<br/>been recognized in this type of four-voice cadence: the progression of<br/>the bass and another voice, here the superius, from a major third or<br/>tenth (A3-C#5) to a unison, octave, or fifteenth, etc. (here D3-D5).</p><p>A characteristic of this &quot;new&quot; two-voice formula is that the upper<br/>voice ascends by a semitone, while the bass falls a fifth or rises a<br/>fourth.</p><p>Zarlino&apos;s own reaction is somewhat mixed: he regards this kind of<br/>formula as characteristic of pieces for three or more voices, but<br/>would prefer a more traditional cadence such as m3-1 or M6-8 in<br/>two-voice writing, although he grants that it would not be a mistake<br/>to use the this M3-8 or similar cadence there also.</p><p>By around 1550, the desire for what both Vicentino and Zarlino<br/>describe as &quot;rich&quot; or &quot;perfect&quot; harmony by the new standards -- a<br/>sonority with a third plus a fifth or a sixth above the bass --<br/>sometimes calls for modifying the traditional formula, as here:</p><p>        C#5  D5<br/>        A4   A4<br/>        E4   F#4<br/>        A3   D3</p><p>In order to arrive at a _harmonia perfetta_ sonority including the<br/>third as well as the fifth, the tenor moves E4-F#4 rather than E4-D4,<br/>so that we actually have parallel sixths between tenor and superius,<br/>rather than the traditional major sixth to octave progression.</p><p>Note that this cadence still has the major tenth between the bass and<br/>superius, moving to a fifteenth.</p><p>Vicentino takes the bass as the voice defining the mode, and considers<br/>motions of this voice by a fifth or fourth to have a mode-defining<br/>quality. He describes four-voice cadences in terms a customary<br/>&quot;action&quot; or progression for each voice, as in this example:</p><p>   C#5 -D5<br/>&quot;soprano cadence&quot;<br/>   A4 - A4<br/>&quot;alto cadence&quot;<br/>   E4 - D4<br/>&quot;tenor cadence&quot;<br/>   A3 - D3<br/>&quot;bass cadence&quot;</p><p>Thus one might say that typically the bass moves down a fifth or up a<br/>fourth; the tenor descends by a step; the alto remains stationary; and<br/>the soprano ascends by a semitone.</p><p>Vicentino shows that these types of cadential roles can be<br/>interchanged, with the bass making a &quot;soprano cadence,&quot; for example,<br/>somewhat in the manner of double or multiple counterpoint.</p><p>For Tomas de Santa Maria, a charaacteristic of this kind of final<br/>cadence is the role of the dissonance of the eleventh -- the 11-10 or<br/>4-3 suspension typically featured. He presents the bass-superius pair<br/>as the most important.</p><p>While Santa Maria is focusing mainly on instrumental music, Vicentino<br/>is at least equally concerned with voices.</p><p>By around 1600, we have the kind of viewpoint expressed by Coperario<br/>in his _Rules How to Compose_, where the resolution of an 11-10<br/>suspension followed by a progression with the bass falling a fifth or<br/>rising a fourth while the upper voice ascends by a semitone is taken<br/>as defining a typical two-voice close:</p><p>             A4 G#4 A4<br/>             E3     A3</p><p>Here I would add that the balance of bass motions by step, by third,<br/>and by fifth or fourth gives 16th-century music a special character<br/>which the meantone system with its pure or near-pure thirds very<br/>nicely fits.</p><p>In surveying the variety of such motions, and four-voice progressions<br/>to fit them, Coperario expresses this pluralistic approach, one<br/>distinct from that of the 18th-century tonal system.</p><p>Again, it is a great pleasure to exchange views on these subjects, and<br/>I welcome more dialogue, as well as comments or questions from others.</p><p>Most appreciatively,</p><p>Margo Schulter<br/><a href="mailto:mschulter@value.net">mschulter@value.net</a></p></div><h3>Alison Monteith &#x3C;alison.monteith3@which.net&#x3E;</h3><span>9/24/2001 10:50:23 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p><a href="mailto:jpehrson@rcn.com">jpehrson@rcn.com</a> wrote:</p><p>&gt; --- In tuning@y..., &quot;Paul Erlich&quot; &lt;paul@s...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; <a href="http://groups.yahoo.com/group/tuning/message/28385">http://groups.yahoo.com/group/tuning/message/28385</a><br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; I&apos;d suggest Easley Blackwood&apos;s book _The Structure of Recognizable<br/>&gt; &gt; Diatonic Tunings_ for more.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Hi Paul...<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Wouldn&apos;t that be nice...

They are the primary combinatorial<br/>product of two simultaneously sounded tones with good harmonicity. It<br/>matters little to me what researches have decided to call them. (This<br/>is NOT to say that the research does not interest me, just in case<br/>anyone is tempted to take it that way.) They are the most audible<br/>subtone generated when two tones of harmonic timbres are sounded<br/>together.</p><p>My theoretical understanding is that these tones are produced in the<br/>human ear due to a slight non-linearity in our hearing. (Difference<br/>products are produced only when frequencies are mixed in a non-linear<br/>device.) There is also a neurological basis contributing to reinforce<br/>this effect. High, shrill tones of rich harmonic timbre produce very<br/>noticable differential tones. They are very annoying when the<br/>intonation is not just. When it is just, the effect can be absolutely<br/>celestial.</p><p>None of this means they don&apos;t exist in other, less obvious contexts.<br/>Any sensorially (internally) generated phenomenon that is not an<br/>original component of the source objects perceived (in this case,<br/>musical tones) tends to get nulled out by our brains&apos; sensory data<br/>processing, since it is always present yet not part of the objective<br/>&quot;picture&quot;. This is called &quot;masking&quot; in psychology. However, this<br/>psychological masking effect can be overcome.</p><p>We all know the ear can be trained to pick out individual harmonics<br/>in a musical timbre, thereby going beyond the usual default<br/>perception of the complete tonal gestalt we call timbre. In the same<br/>way, the ear can learn to pick out these difference tones as<br/>subtones. Once one has learned to do this, it is surprising how LOUD<br/>they are. They are not nearly so subtle as one might suppose.</p><p>On the violin, they are so loud it is hard to understand how anyone<br/>could miss them, but most violinists do in my experience. I have<br/>inquired, since I&apos;m curious and play the violin myself. I heard them<br/>from the first day. I think the violin probably exaggerates them for<br/>the player, since a large component of the sound is transmitted to<br/>the player&apos;s ear by bone conduction, and the coupling through the<br/>chin from the violin body is bound to be quite non-linear.</p><p>To be fair, in a complex musical context they are not always obvious<br/>even to highly trained ears. However, just as we can recognize timbre<br/>intuitively without analyzing or picking out continuously the<br/>individual harmonic components that contribute to it, we can<br/>similarly learn to distinguish clearly when the difference tones are<br/>harmoniously aligned with the source tone fundamentals and their<br/>harmonics.</p><p>Assuming timbres of reasonably high harmonicity, there is only one<br/>condition necessary to ensure alignment of both the differential<br/>tones and the fundamentals and harmonics of the source tones. This<br/>condition is whole number ratios between frequencies. 2:3 therefore<br/>produces a difference tone at 1 an octave below the bottom tone of<br/>the fifth.</p><p>THIS IS NOT SO SUBTLE once you learn to hear it. 4:5 produces 1, two<br/>octaves below the bottom note. A compact major triad in first<br/>inversion produces both the octave and two octaves below the root<br/>with the lower octave also reinforced by the difference tone from the<br/>third and fifth. This is why the major triad is such a highly stable<br/>and consonant harmonic entity.</p><p>Anyone trained to recognize the difference tones&apos; presence is<br/>IMMEDIATELY sensitive to even a slight skewing of these<br/>relationships. This is because, interestingly, pitch is<br/>logarithmically related to frequency and the difference frequency is<br/>a<br/>LINEAR function. So any slight change of the 4:5 third will cause a<br/>pitch change FOUR TIMES AS GREAT in the difference tone two octaves<br/>below.</p><p>This should shed a good deal of light on the basis for many of the<br/>positions I have taken in our discussions.</p></div><h3>BVAL@IIL.INTEL.COM</h3><span>9/27/2001 3:28:53 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Hi,</p><p>Lot of good stuff snipped to trim volume.</p><p>&gt; Anyone trained to recognize the difference tones&apos; presence is<br/>&gt; IMMEDIATELY sensitive to even a slight skewing of these<br/>&gt; relationships.

How do you tune a tonic minor chord?<br/>Do you notice it as being close to the 12tet version, or is the minor<br/>third raised somewhat, (or lowered somewhat) corresponding to a JI sort<br/>of tonic minor?</p><p>The difference tone theory would seem to be most supported by a 16:19:24<br/>ratio tunin for the minor triad, which would be close enough for jazz to<br/>12tet.</p><p>Any of the other likely candiates 10:12:15, or 6:7:9 don&apos;t seem to have<br/>the right properties.</p><p>Bob Valentine</p></div>
