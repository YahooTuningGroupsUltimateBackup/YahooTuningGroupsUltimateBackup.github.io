I remember back a couple of years<br/>ago, someone directed us to some studies that said that the ear drum<br/>vibrated in sections similar to simple ratios of just intonation.<br/>Maybe Paul Erlich had some of these articles.  In any case, there<br/>seems to be some controversy about this.  Lendvai really sets up a<br/>dichotomy between &quot;constructed&quot; scales, like the pentatonic and<br/>others derived from what he considers &quot;golden section&quot; or &quot;Fibonacci<br/>series&quot; and the like and harmonic constructs from the harmonic series.</p><p>Bartok uses both in his work, sometimes for contrast.</p><p>I&apos;ve never before seen arguments where the &quot;constructed&quot; scales were<br/>considered the &quot;natural&quot; ones and the harmonic ones were<br/>the &quot;artificial&quot; so this was an entirely different take on things for<br/>me... :)  Certainly a curiosity.</p></div><h3><a id=77984 href="#77984">ðŸ”—</a>caleb morgan &#x3C;calebmrgn@...&#x3E;</h3><span>7/21/2008 5:57:05 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Hi Carl.</p><p>Forgive me for responding vaguely to the last few months worth of posts.</p><p>-Your new tuning resources group sounds great and I intend to join up...I plead disorganization, stupidity, and laziness.</p><p>-I&apos;m definitely one of those people who has done a lot of research, but is surprised by the sophistication of these groups, as you mentioned a while back.<br/>The biggest obstacle to my improvement, believe it or not, is simply finding the information.</p><p>-Some theorists here and elsewhere seem to confuse units of measurement with elements of their system--but these are obviously different things.<br/>So, you could have a music where the pitches are measured to the hundredth of a cent, but in practice there are only a few pitches, and they are categorized with, say, 20 cent leeway.</p><p>-All music is artificial.  It just has to be do-able.</p><p>-Ok, on to serialism and intelligibility.</p><p>-I love to compose using 12-tone serial techniques, although maybe the love is unrequited.</p><p>-The techniques are generative and don&apos;t guarantee intelligibility.  Intelligibility is achieved only with simplicity, for me.</p><p>-I&apos;ve known a few savants--with absolute pitch and unusual mathematical abilities--who could really hear the series in a Babbitt piece.  They were maybe 1 out of 1,000 conservatory students.  Several of them were close personal friends with Mr. Babbitt.  Small world.  Too small.  I don&apos;t belong.</p><p>-I only have one set of ears, one brain, and I hear all music the same way--I don&apos;t have some special mode for listening to 12-tone.</p><p>-I never hear the aggregate and become satisfied.  Rather, I get a feeling of breadth, richness, complexity when I hear melodies with more than say, 9 or 10 different notes.  And a sense of grayness and nausea if they are used indifferently.</p><p>-In practice, all the 12-tone stuff I write is embellished tonal music.  12 notes get chunked into smaller groups--say mutually opposed hexachords, 3 tetrachords, etc.  Notes can be omitted, or sent to the Siberia of extreme registers, or otherwise de-emphasized.</p><p>-It&apos;s a Rube Goldberg technique, in a way.</p><p>-We/I also have the assistance of software that can make some aspects of 12-tone composition easier..(Carter once remarked that he&apos;d need a computer to do 12-tone...)</p><p>-Coherence in the piece is probably provided in other ways than strictly by serial ordering, but that ordering does make a difference:  One hears the same (somewhat abstract) harmonies and contours over and over.  A sufficiently different series sounds, well...different, in context.</p><p>-back to tuning:  I want to get my tuning tech to the next level, guess I&apos;ll ask you questions over in your other group...</p><p>On Jul 20, 2008, at 6:58 PM, Carl Lumma wrote:</p><p>&gt; ...<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; However, I think for melody, it is very hard to use much<br/>&gt; more than 7 tones.

Actually, that was a stand-in for 3 different incidents I remember--Joel Smirnoff playing a Sessions Concerto;  a blind pianist named Kevin Gibbs playing Anthony Braxton and a (to me) random-sounding piece by Robert Ceely;  and finally, a violinist by the name of David Fulmer listening to Babbitt, and demonstrating these abilities with the music of Carter, Babbitt, Davidovsky, and others.  James Levine is probably similar.
