Thanks Paul for all your help.  But, why don&apos;t you<br/>&gt;consider having Monz post this derivation as a continuation of your<br/>&gt;Entropy article...  Even if some of us don&apos;t understand it, it probably<br/>&gt;will be fun to look at... (I&apos;m being serious.)</p><p>Well, Monz is not accepting contributions to his website right now, but<br/>here&apos;s the derivation:</p><p>You&apos;re already familiar with the Farey series -- for example, the Farey<br/>series of order 6 is</p><p>    1  6  5  4  3  5  2  5  3  4  5  6<br/>    -, -, -, -, -, -, -, -, -, -, -, -<br/>    1  5  4  3  2  3  1  2  1  1  1  1</p><p>This series has the property that any two consecutive fractions pi/qi and<br/>pj/qj satisfy</p><p>    pj*qi - pi*qj = 1                               (formula 0)</p><p>(Three proofs of this are given in Hardy, G. H. and Wright, E. M. _An<br/>Introduction to the Theory of Numbers_. Oxford University Press, London,<br/>Chapter 3.)</p><p>If the next fraction after pj/qj is denoted by pk/qk, we find</p><p>    1 = pj*qi - pi*qj = pk*qj - pj*qk<br/>    pj*qi + pj*qk = pk*qj + pi*qj</p><p>Thus</p><p>    pj   pk + pi<br/>    -- = -------                                    (formula 1)<br/>    qj   qi + qk</p><p>Now assume that we are dealing with a Farey series of very high order N, say<br/>at least 80, and that the fractions we&apos;re interested in examining are<br/>relatively simple, so if we&apos;re looking at pj/qj, pj is small compared with<br/>N. So</p><p>    pk and pi are approximately equal to N,         (formula 2)</p><p>because:</p><p>(a) membership in the Farey series requires that they be &lt;= N;<br/>(b) pi is &gt; N - pj, since if pi were &lt;= N - pj, the fraction (pi + pj)/(qi +<br/>qj), which lies between pi/qi and pj/qj, would also belong to the Farey<br/>series of order N, contradicting the assumption that pi/qi and pj/qj are<br/>consecutive (same argument for pk).</p><p>Since they are consecutive, all three fractions pi/qi, pj/qj, and pk/qk are<br/>similar in magnitude, thus formula 2 is equivalent to the assertion that</p><p>    qk, qi, and N*qj/pj are similar in magnitude.   (formula 2c)</p><p>By formula 1 we know that</p><p>    c*pj = pk + pi, c*qj = qi + qk                  (formula 3)</p><p>for some c, so</p><p>    pk = c*pj - pi, qi = c*qj - qk                  (formula 4)</p><p>whence</p><p>    qk = c*qj - qi                                  (formula 5)</p><p>From formula 4,</p><p>    pk*qi = c*c*pj*qj - c*pi*qj - c*pj*qk + pi*qk</p><p>and using formula 5,</p><p>    pk*qi - pi*qk = c*c*pj*qj - c*pi*qj - c*pj*(c*qj - qi)<br/>    pk*qi - pi*qk = -c*pi*qj + c*pj*qi<br/>    pk*qi - pi*qk = c                               (formula 6)</p><p>by virtue of formula 0. Now formulae 2 and 3 tell us that</p><p>    c is approximately equal to 2*N/pj</p><p>so</p><p>    pk*qi - pi*qk is approximately equal to 2*N/pj  (formula 7)</p><p>While N is still finite, there is a range of intervals f1/f2 which could be<br/>intepreted as pj/qj (i.e., they &apos;belong&apos; to pj/qj&apos;s immediate realm on the<br/>number line). A natural set of bounds for this range is defined by the<br/>so-called mediants, the simplest fractions between pi/qi and pj/qj, and<br/>between pj/qj and pk/qk:</p><p>                 pi + pj   f1   pj + pk<br/>    leftbound =  ------- &lt; -- &lt; ------- = rightbound<br/>                 qi + qj   f2   qj + qk</p><p>(See Mann, Chester D., 1990. _Analytic Study of Harmonic Intervals_. Tustin,<br/>Calif., p. 163, for a justification for using mediants as &quot;transition<br/>points&quot; coming from a consideration of beat rates.)</p><p>which unambiguously ascribes to any f1/f2 one and only one fraction from the<br/>Farey series, namely pi/pj. Now the width of this range on a logarithmic<br/>scale, say a scale of cents, is given by</p><p>            rightbound      (pi + pj)/(qi + qj)<br/>    Wj = log---------- = log-------------------<br/>            leftbound       (pj + pk)/(qj + qk)</p><p>Since in our case pj and qj are relatively small,</p><p>                                    pk*qi<br/>    Wj is approximately equal to log-----<br/>                                    pi*qk</p><p>and since Wj is a small number close to 0, we can use the approximation<br/>log(x) = x - 1:</p><p>                                 pk*qi<br/>    Wj is approximately equal to ----- - 1<br/>                                 pi*qk</p><p>or</p><p>                                 pk*qi - pi*qk<br/>    Wj is approximately equal to -------------<br/>                                     pi*qk</p><p>Substituting formulae 7, 2, and 2c,</p><p>                                  2*N/pj<br/>    Wj is approximately equal to ---------<br/>                                 N*N*qj/pj</p><p>or</p><p>                                  2<br/>    Wj is approximately equal to ----<br/>                                 N*qj</p><p>So what we have found is, for any fraction much simpler than the Farey<br/>limit, the size of the range it occupies is inversely proportional to the<br/>denominator of the fraction.</p><p>It can be shown more precisely that for all fractions pj/qj in the Farey<br/>limit, regardless of relative simplicity (in other words, dropping formula 2<br/>and its consequents),</p><p>     1           2<br/>    ---- &lt; Wj &lt; ----<br/>    N*qj        N*qj</p><p>I&apos;ll leave the proof of this as an exercise for the reader.
