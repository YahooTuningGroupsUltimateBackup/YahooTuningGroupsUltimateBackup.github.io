So for instance, specifying Eb major as a key gives you<br/>a duodene transposed to 6/5, whereas Eb &apos;passing major&apos; gives you a duodene<br/>transposed to 32/37. If I have a chain of fifths modulation from C-F-Bb-Eb,<br/>this comes in handy, allowing there to be a majority of pivot tones from the<br/>old key, while keeping the pure 5-limit relationships of the duodene,<br/>without immediately apparent audible commatic drift.</p><p>I redid my SysEx messages to reflect this idea, and here is the result:</p><p><a href="http://www.akjmusic.com/audio/AndanteDoloroso3.ogg">http://www.akjmusic.com/audio/AndanteDoloroso3.ogg</a><br/><a href="http://www.akjmusic.com/audio/AndanteDoloroso3.mp3">http://www.akjmusic.com/audio/AndanteDoloroso3.mp3</a></p><p>Let me know if any of you still hear anything strange that I might have<br/>missed....</p><p>Best,<br/>AKJ</p><p>P.S. here is the online message where I first learned how TiMidity can use<br/>SysEx<br/>messages for MTS (and extensions):</p><p><a href="http://www.mail-archive.com/timidity-talk@.../msg00081.html">http://www.mail-archive.com/timidity-talk@.../msg00081.html</a></p><p>On Tue, Sep 15, 2009 at 10:27 AM, Aaron Johnson &lt;aaron@...m&gt; wrote:</p><p>&gt; Hey Petr, everyone,<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; try these files out...<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; <a href="http://www.akjmusic.com/audio/AndanteDoloroso2.ogg">http://www.akjmusic.com/audio/AndanteDoloroso2.ogg</a><br/>&gt; <a href="http://www.akjmusic.com/audio/AndanteDoloroso2.mp3">http://www.akjmusic.com/audio/AndanteDoloroso2.mp3</a><br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I fixed the issue you (Petr) noticed.

Furthermore, there is the undocumented issue of having four<br/>&gt; choices: major, minor, passing major, and passing minor. What the difference<br/>&gt; between &apos;passing major&apos; and &apos;major&apos; is unclear, but I would assume it has to<br/>&gt; do with the functioning of pivots.

As far as I&apos;m<br/>concerned, 19/16 and 6/5 have differences, but the highly fragile<br/>psychoacoustic nature of all of this means that one can often function<br/>as the other from a perceptual standpoint. Hearing 19/16 as a direct<br/>consonance is somewhat difficult for me unless there are other notes<br/>in the chord to reinforce it as such (the key one being 5/4 and<br/>sometimes 7/4). Something like C-E-Bb-Eb is the proverbial example of<br/>this - what&apos;s the most perceptually coherent way to map this chord<br/>back into JI?</p><p>Then again, perhaps it might be more perceptually intuitive to feel<br/>the Eb out as 7/3. I suppose it would hinge on whether you tend to<br/>hear the Bb-Eb as being a really strong 4/3 or not. I&apos;m not really an<br/>expert on determining which of the zillions of intonations of &quot;minor<br/>third&quot; is the one I&apos;m hearing at any particular moment. I think you<br/>will agree that the Eb in C-E-Bb-Eb has a completely different kind of<br/>flavor than a straight C-Eb-G minor chord though, and I expect this to<br/>be because the two cases lead to them being perceived as two different<br/>harmonic intervals. Just my humble opinion.</p><p>&gt; As I said before, the minor third of 1/1 6/5 3/2 where 1/1 is the fundamental bass sounds wrong to my ears.<br/>&gt; This is not a short burst of insanity I have :)<br/>&gt; I&apos;ve researched / played it a lot over a longer period of time. Tried it in different settings/chord progressions etc.<br/>&gt; My ears simply will not accept 6/5 here, it sounds out of tune and too wide to me.

Only Michael shortly agreed with me when I pointed it out to him with the Beethoven piece as n example, and Mike with 19/16.</p><p>I do agree with this in certain circumstances - especially when the<br/>chord is in a tenor or baritone register. The lower the minor chord,<br/>the more excessively wide that minor third starts to sound to me. That<br/>being said, the heightened dissonance of the relatively wide minor<br/>third in a 10:12:15 chord actually adds something to the already<br/>dissonant enough minor triad as far as I&apos;m concerned -- it&apos;s a<br/>beautiful sound to my ears, and sometimes it adds a poignance to the<br/>minor chord that just isn&apos;t there with 0-300-700 cents.</p><p>As I hear it, replacing 10:12:15 with 16:19:24 in these lower<br/>registers usually serves to increase critical band smearing effects a<br/>bit, but with the tradeoff of an increase in the underlying harmonic<br/>consonance of the whole triad. It might be because the fundamentals of<br/>most of the dyads in 10:12:15, as well as the triad as a whole, are at<br/>a pretty steep angle to the root that we&apos;d all like to hear the minor<br/>chord as having. This phenomenon seems to be noticeably more annoying<br/>as the chord gets lower and lower, and does not happen with 16:19:24.</p><p>That being said, intonating it as 6:5 and simply placing it in a<br/>higher register makes for an extremely &quot;bright&quot; minor chord, and I do<br/>tend to like that sound an awful lot.</p><p>-Mike</p></div><h3>Mike Battaglia &#x3C;battaglia01@...&#x3E;</h3><span>9/17/2009 12:04:42 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>&gt; Marcel wrote:<br/>&gt; &gt; Btw since you are close to a human library of this tuning list,<br/>&gt; &gt; I&apos;d love to ask you the following question :)</p><p>LOL, ain&apos;t he though?</p><p>&gt; It has been discussed.
