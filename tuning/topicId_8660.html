Sorry for that.</p><p>Angela, even if this not exactly the &quot;How to play the guitar in one lesson&quot;<br/>list, the subject might interest some people, because it&apos;s very essential.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt;From what I gather, if I want to tune the top string down, I can easily tune<br/>&gt; the top sting to the d string (ie 3rd string?) or as someone suggested pick<br/>&gt; the note from the fret below... sound right???</p><p>The top string is the highest sounding string. The *normal* D is the fourth.<br/>You&apos;re mixing up &quot;high/low&quot; and &quot;up/down&quot;. The melody goes up when your<br/>fingers go down. Many beginning students logically make that mistake.<br/>There&apos;s also an historical example:</p><p>Luys Milan (16th century) proposed in one of his vihuela pieces (the Fantasy<br/>XIV) to move the fourth fret &quot;up a little&quot; to get a *stronger* sound from<br/>the notes in that position:</p><p>&quot;Esta fantasia que se sigue tanbien es para hazer redobles con dos dedos: y<br/>sienpre q(ue) tanereys el quarto y tercero tono por estos terminos q(ue)<br/>esta fa(n)tasia anda: alcareys un poco el quarto traste de la vihuela para<br/>que el punto del dicho traste sea fuerte y no flaco&quot;.</p><p>(Can anybody translate this correctly? I use a french translation myself)</p><p> We&apos;re still not sure what he ment. &quot;alcareys un poco&quot;: raise a bit. But in<br/>what direction? Upwards melodically, towards the bridge, or upwards<br/>physically, towards the tuning mechanism? The fourth fret gives a major<br/>third from the open string, so Milan&apos;s indication should tell us something<br/>wether he was *meantone* or *Pythagorean*.</p><p>You should tune the 4th and the 5th string with your tuner and then compare<br/>the octaves for the other D&apos;s and the A. The 4th fret on he 4th string gives<br/>you the F#. If you play D and F# together you hear the major third. Do you<br/>like that sound? Listen to it over and over again. You may tune down the F#<br/>a little. Thus you get the low major third (meantone, natural, 5:4...) If<br/>you tune the F# higher than the fourth fret tells you, you get Jerry<br/>Eskelin&apos;s &quot;high&quot; third or even the Pythagorean one. Now strum the whole open<br/>chord D, A, D, F#, A, D.<br/>*My* ears tell me that the low F# tends to disappear, to melt in the<br/>surrounded notes, while a high F# remains clearly distinguishable. Angela,<br/>if all this rings your bell, stay on the list and learn all about it.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I have another question about when a &quot;song is in C#m&quot; for instance and they<br/>&gt; say to just place the capo on the 6th fret.  Is that just removing the need<br/>&gt; for tuning each of the strings into that key?</p><p>A capo simply transposes the tuning of the open string and adapts what you<br/>play to your voice, if you want to sing at the same time. Of course a capo<br/>works only for upward transposition. To go downwards you really have to drop<br/>the tuning of all the open strings. That&apos;s currently done. A good example,<br/>but not known by everybody, is Paul McCartney singing &quot;Yesterday&quot; with his<br/>guitar in standard tuning but a whole tone lower. In this way he plays *in<br/>G* what you normally get *in F* when you buy the music.</p><p>--Wim</p></div>
