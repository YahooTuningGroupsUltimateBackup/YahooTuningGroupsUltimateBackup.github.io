The problem is, it&apos;s hard to know what else to call<br/>it.</p><p>One can analyze all the subsets of a given ET, such as 12-tet, and<br/>look at the &quot;interval vectors&quot; which are derived from them. For<br/>example, take (0,1,2,3,4,5) which is a hexachord subset of 12-tet.<br/>It has an &quot;interval vector&quot; of &lt;5,4,3,2,1,0&gt; if one counts all the<br/>intervals in the set: 5 1-steps (or semitones), 4 2-steps (wholetones)<br/>3 3-steps (minor thirds) 2 4-steps (major thirds) 1 5-steps (perfect<br/>fourths and 0 6-steps (tritones). Going higher, you just mirror image<br/>the vector (so it is not neccessary to give 7- through 11-steps)</p><p>Well, it turns out that subsets that are the mirror-image of a set<br/>have the same interval vector. Also, sets related by the &quot;Z-relation&quot;<br/>have the same interval vector (This is when two or more sets of<br/>different Tn/TnI type have the same interval vector). I have been<br/>analyzing subsets in various ETs to see if there is a pattern to<br/>the unique interval-vector counts they have. This may or may not<br/>be calculable, because the &quot;Z-relation&quot; is so elusive. For example<br/>in 12-tet there is 1 Z-relation among Tetrachords, 3 among<br/>Pentachords and 15 among hexachords (This is AFTER reducing for<br/>Tn/TnI, that is, transposition and transposition of inverses)</p><p>I&apos;d like to stimulate discussion on this issue, I have been<br/>corresponding with John Wild out at Harvard who has compiled a large<br/>database of sets with interval vectors, all the way up to 30-tet.<br/>Anyone else out there interested in this line of attack? Thought I<br/>would start this up again on Tuning, and if neccessary, we can go<br/>over to Tuning-math with any discussion that is more mathematical!</p><p>Paul Hjelmstad</p></div><h3>Gene Ward Smith &#x3C;gwsmith@svpal.org&#x3E;</h3><span>3/16/2004 2:39:47 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;Paul G Hjelmstad&quot;<br/>&lt;paul.hjelmstad@u...&gt; wrote:</p><p>&gt; First, I should say that what some musicians call &quot;Set theory&quot;, is<br/>&gt; not really &quot;Set Theory&quot; as described by mathematicians, that is a<br/>&gt; field in itself.

We have been having trouble<br/>tranferring data between Jon&apos;s server at Harvard and my webpage. (The<br/>files are huge). What I have found out on my own is that there really<br/>is no pattern to the behavior of Z-relations. However, I am still<br/>hopeful that there may be a pattern to sets based on interval vectors:<br/>(Intvec(24,12)) for example, would be the count of interval vectors<br/>of sets reduced from C{24,12}. It equals 24,220, which is 4 * 5 * 13<br/>* 97. However, I have found that sets reduced from C{n,9} have been<br/>prime numbers. I was hoping to find a pattern in the factorization of<br/>the resultant set-count which relates somehow to the initial C{n,m}<br/>function count. (Can I call it a function?) For sets reduced from<br/>C{12,m} You obtain (Intvec(12,m)) for m=0_to_12:<br/>1,1,6,12,28,35,35,35,28,12,6,1,1. None are prime numbers, and 5 are<br/>based on 7, and 4 are based on 6, etc. Unfortunately there is nothing<br/>(that I know of) like Polya&apos;s algorithm to find this &quot;polynomial&quot;<br/>series.
