The consistent<br/>avoidance of parallel fifths starts maybe around the middle of the<br/>15th century, say 1440 or so -- interestingly, just about the same<br/>epoch as the introduction of meantone.</p><p>Before 1300 or so, there is no specific restriction in theory or<br/>practice on parallel fifths, although there is a general preference in<br/>12th-13th polyphony for contrary motion; parallel fifths and fourths<br/>routinely occur in a system where the strongest directed progressions<br/>involve contrary motion, rather as parallel thirds and sixths occur in<br/>Renaissance polyphony as a permitted liberty although contrary motion<br/>is again the general preference.</p><p>In fact, in 13th-century writing, fifths are often favored as parallels,<br/>since they represent ideal euphony and rich stability.</p><p>Between 1300 and around 1440, parallel fifths are often restricted in<br/>theory -- especially for simple two-voice textures -- but more freely<br/>used in practice, and occur in some standard cadences for three and<br/>four voices.</p><p>The consistent avoidance of parallel fifths (in &quot;serious&quot; genres of<br/>polyphony, with exceptions here and there) from around 1440 or so<br/>seems more or less to coincide with a shift from 3-limit to 5-limit<br/>verticality, and a corresponding shift from Pythagorean tuning to some<br/>flavor of meantone on keyboards.</p><p>Most respectfully,</p><p>Margo Schulter<br/><a href="mailto:mschulter@value.net">mschulter@value.net</a></p></div><h3>Pierre Lamothe &#x3C;plamothe@aei.ca&#x3E;</h3><span>9/17/2000 9:27:39 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Thanks to Margo Schulter for the quick note on 3-limit/5-limit transition.<br/>It&apos;s the kind I like very much.</p><p>I&apos;m not musician, and thus less concerned with tuning for immediate use,<br/>but such massive facts feed my thoughts for long.</p><p>In present case I&apos;m forced to revise my view and I would like to have often<br/>this opportunity.</p><p>Pierre Lamothe</p></div>
