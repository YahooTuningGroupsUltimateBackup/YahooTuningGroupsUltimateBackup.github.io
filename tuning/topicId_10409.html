I must say i haven&apos;t listen to<br/>what you are doing nor really followed this thread. I can&apos;t judge any tuning in a one off midi<br/>translation. I can&apos;t comment on acoustic instrument translated to electronic version. Would<br/>have to hear it on a real acoustic instrument and then i feel i might be able to judge. With<br/>most midi samples of even materials that i know well, or think i know well, I find<br/>unrecognizable, so i pass over all of them. I envy those of you on this list that can. Like i<br/>have said maybe too many times, I started out in 31 et and it took a while before I realized I<br/>just couldn&apos;t use it any more. Being my first tuning, it is understandable. I this point its a<br/>matter of days. Any tuning can work for a short period, it is a tunings ability to withstand<br/>some test of time that makes it useful. I am not criticizing your work, for how often has the<br/>research in one direction given fruit in another. I have no real interest in 5 limit tunings<br/>under 17 tones, at this point no real interest in Bach or Mozart but proceed, our work is<br/>bound to cross at some time.</p><p>&quot;John A. deLaubenfels&quot; wrote:</p><p>&gt; Do you prefer the Bach in 12-tET than in 5-limit adaptive grounded to<br/>&gt; COFT?  How about the Mozart?  Certainly in the music itself the process<br/>&gt; of stress and resolution from stress is played out many times; it is in<br/>&gt; the bones of the notes themselves.  Are you saying that a more<br/>&gt; dissonant tuning helps you enjoy the music?</p><p>-- Kraig Grady<br/>North American Embassy of Anaphoria island<br/><a href="http://www.anaphoria.com">www.anaphoria.com</a></p></div><h3>D.Stearns &#x3C;STEARNS@CAPECOD.NET&#x3E;</h3><span>6/4/2000 4:36:45 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>John A. deLaubenfels wrote,</p><p>&gt; Could you clarify what you&apos;re opposed to?</p><p>Well in short, any tuning &apos;ideology&apos; that would _always  have vertical<br/>major triad _best represented by a (or a very near) 4:5:6...<br/>&quot;ideology&quot; being the important part of my opposition, because I&apos;m NOT<br/>opposed to the endeavor, and am in fact impressed by your continued<br/>commitment to fine tuning and experimenting with it.</p><p>&gt; Again, I do not dispute that dissonance is an integral part of some<br/>music.  Sometimes it should not be diminished at all.</p><p>For me, I&apos;ve always been more comfortable with ambiguity and<br/>dissonance than I have been with consonances... when I was a teenager<br/>and got my first guitar it came with a chord book, and I distinctly<br/>remember wanting to move the positions of the fretted notes to make<br/>most of the chords sound better - inevitably this was always something<br/>like moving the fretted notes in an open position E minor seventh down<br/>a fret... My mother also signed me right up for some guitar lessons,<br/>and after the first month of mutual frustrations between me and the<br/>guitar teacher, he informed my mother that it was &quot;hopeless&quot; - No ear,<br/>and less rhythm!</p><p>&gt; But there&apos;s a LOT of music that is, IMHO, made more sweet and more<br/>powerful by the application of dynamic tuning.  To some ears, at<br/>least, certainly including mine!</p><p>Oh I&apos;m sure your right, and I wouldn&apos;t doubt or question that for a<br/>minute... though I do believe that that would hold true for the<br/>opposite as well...</p><p>&gt; Anyone who prefers Mozart (say) in 12-tET or in some other tuning<br/>has my blessing.  We were not born the same.</p><p>I guess the things that interest and fires me up are probably just<br/>going to be completely different from what are the real pertinent and<br/>more or less doable issues of adaptive retuning... and I guess that if<br/>I were to set my mind to something like adaptive retuning, I would be<br/>more interested in exploring something like how to &apos;best&apos; or<br/>&apos;optimally&apos; retune something like Ives&apos; second orchestral set, where<br/>complex and slippery issues like programmatic simultaneity would both<br/>enrich and bedevil issues such as what&apos;s &apos;sweet&apos; and &apos;sour&apos; in the<br/>music.</p><p>Dan</p><p>ps - Keep up the good work and don&apos;t much listen to me...</p></div>
