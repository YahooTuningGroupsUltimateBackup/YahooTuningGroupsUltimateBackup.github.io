The<br/>&gt; functional wave viewer is great too (I expected it to just show<br/>&gt; presets or something, but it actually displays a real-time black &amp;<br/>&gt; white bar view of the wave frequency).</p><p>From your description this has to be a Scalatron tuner.  I imagine<br/>that there might be a way to interface a keyboard controller (for one-<br/>note-at-a-time output), but I wouldn&apos;t recommend attempting this<br/>unless you&apos;re heavily into electronics.</p><p>Motorola made two models of the tuner.  The older model had the tone<br/>generator (with 1024 tones/octave) and the video display as separate<br/>pieces connected by a 1/4-in. phone cord.  Microtonal pitches were<br/>generated by setting various combinations of 10 binary switches,<br/>according to a computer-generated table (in both Hz and cents) that<br/>was included in the instruction manual.  I&apos;m not sure if I have a<br/>manual for this version, but I do have the table and an electronic<br/>schematic diagram.</p><p>The newer (less expensive) model was consolidated into a single piece<br/>to be marketed to schools.  It was considerably less versatile in<br/>that it generated only the pitches of 12-equal (adjustable up or down<br/>in increments of ~4 cents).</p><p>The video display for both models consists of a split screen with the<br/>reference pitch (a low-pass filtered square-wave oscillator) at the<br/>left and the live sound (voice or instrument via microphone input) at<br/>the right.  As you attempt to match the generated pitch, the display<br/>on the right rolls upward or downward according to whether you&apos;re<br/>higher or lower, and you can literally see beats as the bars pass by<br/>one another.  (The rolling also stops when your input frequency is a<br/>simple ratio with respect to the generated frequency, e.g., an octave<br/>or just fifth, fourth, twelfth, etc.)</p><p>We found that the tuner could be used to evaluate the intonation of a<br/>singer or player in real time using a previously prepared two-track<br/>tape with recorded accompaniment (audible to the player) on one track<br/>and reference pitches recorded from a Scalatron (and patched into the<br/>left channel of the tuner to bypass the internal oscillator) on the<br/>other track.  Hearing only the recorded accompaniment, the player<br/>could play along and get instantaneous feedback regarding how closely<br/>the reference pitches were being matched.  (And since the reference<br/>pitches were produced on a Scalatron, the music could be microtonal,<br/>providing that the accompaniment was also.)  It was not necessary for<br/>the player to memorize the music, because the video display was large<br/>enough to be seen easily with peripheral vision while reading a<br/>printed part -- I know this for a fact, because I tested it myself,<br/>playing a trumpet along with a recorded piano accompaniment.</p><p>Sounds pretty nifty, eh?</p><p>--George Secor</p></div><h3><a id=67431 href="#67431">ðŸ”—</a>treen0 &#x3C;treen0@adelphia.net&#x3E;</h3><span>8/15/2006 4:43:19 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;George D.
