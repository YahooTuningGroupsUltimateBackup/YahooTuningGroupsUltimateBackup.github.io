I think it sent as Unicode, so my apologies for any confusion.  ~DaW<br/>  ----- Original Message -----<br/>  From: Danny Wier<br/>  To: <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a><br/>  Sent: Tuesday, December 04, 2001 1:07 AM<br/>  Subject: [tuning] Arabic rast vs. Turkish rast</p><p>  This reminds me of what my ex-girlfriend (the one I almost married) told me about her childhood: she had a Turkish father and an Iranian mother.  If they were going along in a car and somebody said &#x631;&#x627;&#x633;&#x62A; r&acirc;st, there was some confusion because the word means &quot;right (hand)&quot; in Farsi but &quot;straight&quot; in Turkish, or something like that.  I&apos;m not sure whether the word is of Persian or Arabic origin; I think it&apos;s the former.</p><p>  (Linguistics happens to be my second love after music.  I&apos;m just a whole lot better at music, since the only language I can speak with a fair amount of fluency is Spanish.)</p></div>
