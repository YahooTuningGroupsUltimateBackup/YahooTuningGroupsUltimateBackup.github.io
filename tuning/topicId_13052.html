A perfectly reasonable assertion, I&apos;d say. There can&apos;t help but be a continuum of<br/>compositional aptitude, from some relative low to some relative high. Paraphrased, he also<br/>states that he has yet to hear truly great music emerge from the paradigm of new tuning<br/>resources, since compostional greatness is more a matter of the composer than the resources. I<br/>concur.<br/>    But..... it takes awhile to get a grip on new methods, and if out of a group of 350(?) no<br/>_truly great_ compositions emerge over the period of 5 years, well, that seems reasonable,<br/>given the sparsity of great composers in any sample. I haven&apos;t heard a microtonal Bach yet,<br/>but I&apos;ve heard some very good microtonal music, some of it intriguing, some uplifting, some<br/>hilarious. There are also some compositions I have only listened to a couple of times. We are<br/>doing our jobs: writing music, analyzing tuning systems, educating each other.... So...<br/>everybody BACK TO WORK!!!</p></div>
