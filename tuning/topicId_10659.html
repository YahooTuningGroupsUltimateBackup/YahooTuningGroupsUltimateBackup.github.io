Chapman&quot; wrote:</p><p>&gt; Hi Folks,<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Before I get to far into this, here&apos;s a translation table of a couple of<br/>&gt; terms:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;    American: raga, Hindustani: raag, Carnatic: raaga or raagam<br/>&gt;    -- taken as a set, ragas occupy a wide stretch of territory along the<br/>&gt;       continuum between a scale and a song<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;    American: tala, Hindustani: taal, Carnatic: taala or taalam<br/>&gt;    -- a rhythmic cycle<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; In the Hindustani and Carnatic terms above, the &quot;aa&quot; sounds like the<br/>&gt; &quot;aah&quot; sound you make for the doctor or dentist.  The &quot;a&quot; sounds like the<br/>&gt; &quot;u&quot; in &quot;gum&quot;.  So, &quot;raagam&quot; sounds like &quot;raah-gum&quot; -- as if you were<br/>&gt; cheering on your chewing gum.  :-)  I use these variations on the terms<br/>&gt; somewhat interchangeably, as you&apos;ll notice below.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; As the spouse of a Hindustani classical vocalist from northern India and<br/>&gt; the friend of several Indian Hindustani classical and Carnatic classical<br/>&gt; musicians, I feel obligated to make a few clarifications about Indian<br/>&gt; music and tuning after reading some of the posts here that seem to imply<br/>&gt; that Indian music is one big homogeneous system with a consistent set of<br/>&gt; ragas, talas, tunings, etc.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Indian classical music is *NOT* one big homogeneous system with a<br/>&gt; consistent set of ragas, talas, tunings, etc.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;From northern India comes system of classical music called Hindustani.<br/>&gt; &gt;From southern India comes a system of classical music called Carnatic.<br/>&gt; They are not the same.  Yes, some Hindustani raags and taals are<br/>&gt; similar to some Carnatic raagams and taalams, but for most cases, they<br/>&gt; are different.  Even their forms of composition and performance differ.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Within either system, there are differences in interpretation of raga,<br/>&gt; tala, and tuning all the way down to the individual performer and even<br/>&gt; to individual performances of the same performer.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Ethnomusicologists such as Nazir Jairazbhoy have done studies which<br/>&gt; showed that, even for common ragas, there is a lot of variability in the<br/>&gt; intervals used, even if restricting the comparisons to performances by a<br/>&gt; single master performer.  Jairazbhoy and his students have written for<br/>&gt; the &quot;Journal of Ethnomusicology&quot;, and Jairazbhoy also has a book out<br/>&gt; called &quot;The Rags of North Indian Music : Their Structure and Evolution&quot;<br/>&gt; which, if I remember correctly, does get into this subject.  (My copy is<br/>&gt; at home and I&apos;m [physically] at work, hence my uncertainty.)<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Here are some more references regarding the variability of intervals in<br/>&gt; Indian music that a friend sent during an earlier email exchange I had<br/>&gt; with a couple of my south Indian Carnatic musician friends (whilst we<br/>&gt; were trying to work out suitable fret positions for the other party&apos;s<br/>&gt; Carnatic vina):<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;    ---------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;    Levy, Mark, 1946-<br/>&gt;    Intonation in North Indian music : a select comparison of theories<br/>&gt;      with contemporary practice / Mark Levy.<br/>&gt;    New Delhi : Biblia Impex, 1982.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;    Powers, Harold Stone, 1928-<br/>&gt;    The background of the South Indian Raga-system.<br/>&gt;    [Ann Arbor, University Microfilms, 1960]<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;    Vidya Shankar.<br/>&gt;    The art and science of carnatic music / Vidya Shankar. 1st ed.<br/>&gt;    Madras : Music Academy Madras, 1983.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;    The Jairazhbhoy and Stone study on intonation in contemporary<br/>&gt;    Hindustani music -- particularly relating to the G2 in Yaman -- is<br/>&gt;    from the Bulletin of the School of Oriental and African Studies.  The<br/>&gt;    exact reference should be in the first book listed above... and in<br/>&gt;    fact the book above may even carry the entire details from that<br/>&gt;    study.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;    ---------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Also: I believe Dr. Can Akkoc has written about the variability of<br/>&gt; intervals in the Turkish classical music system, though I am afraid I do<br/>&gt; not have any of his writings.  I remember reading some posts by him on<br/>&gt; this list some time ago.  I suspect that the sort of variable interval<br/>&gt; phenomenon he observes in Turkish music may be similar to what goes on<br/>&gt; in Indian music.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Dr. Akkoc, are you still on this list?  I would love to get an update on<br/>&gt; your research (and reprint[s] of your paper[s]).
