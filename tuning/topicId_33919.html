When I was done, HE was<br/>&gt; completely baffled.</p><p>you just gave a pretty good description of at least part of the<br/>reason why 12edo (or simply 12-tone thinking in general, even for<br/>other tunings) was so easy to adopt.  it&apos;s the smallest unit that<br/>gives you the entire rotational set of diatonic scales and modes<br/>in terms of half- and whole-steps.  in 12edo, they literally<br/> a r e  all half- and whole-steps.</p><p>it&apos;s not surprising that both of you were baffled by<br/>each other&apos;s explanations.  the notation grew up around<br/>Pythagorean thinking, as i explain at the beginning of<br/>&lt;<a href="http://www.ixpres.com/interval/dict/hewm.htm">http://www.ixpres.com/interval/dict/hewm.htm</a>&gt;,<br/>then was adapted for use in meantone.  in both of those<br/>cases there has to be a distinction between # and b<br/>-- meantone essentially reverses the Pythagorean meaning<br/>of the symbols, but they&apos;re still distinct.</p><p>in 12edo (or something close to it) there is no distinction<br/>between # and b, and so the half-step/whole-step business<br/>is a little harder to explain using the Pythagorean/meantone<br/>symbols.  it&apos;s much easier to do it your way, Bob, simply<br/>starting from the basic fact that everything in 12edo is<br/>generated from the semitone, and to show all the &quot;half-steps&quot;<br/>and &quot;whole-steps&quot; as 1 and 2 semitones respectively.</p><p>i find in teaching my piano students that the best way to<br/>get them to understand the key system of our mishmash hybrid<br/>Pythagorean/meantone-notation-and-12edo-tuning system<br/>is to use the &quot;circle of 5ths&quot; in conjunction with the<br/>idea of tetrachordal similarity.  they learn each &quot;major<br/>scale&quot; on the piano by using four fingers of each hand,<br/>so the pattern is (use &quot;expand messages&quot; to view this<br/>on the Yahoo web interface):</p><p>      C  D   E   F      G  A  B   C  notes<br/>  LH: 5  4   3   2  RH: 2  3  4   5  fingers<br/>       1   1  1/2   1    1  1  1/2   steps between<br/>       \________/   \/   \________/<br/>         lower     tone    upper<br/>      tetrachord    of   tetrachord<br/>                disjunction</p><p>each hand playing an intervallically identical tetrachord,<br/>with the &quot;tone of disjunction&quot; falling between hands.</p><p>then to move to the key and scale a &quot;5th&quot; higher,<br/>they simply switch the right hand with the left and<br/>copy the same pattern of &quot;whole-whole-half&quot; starting<br/>a &quot;tone&quot; higher for the new tetrachord in the right hand,<br/>which simply requires raising the 4th finger a &quot;half-step&quot;.</p><p>i draw the &quot;circle of 5ths&quot; for them as they go thru<br/>this procedure, and when we finish the key of C#, we<br/>start over again on C and go around the other way to<br/>do the flat keys, where the hand-switching is a bit<br/>different.</p><p>i find that by using this method, my students get a<br/>very quick understanding of the whole standard system<br/>of keys as they are ordinarily used, and there is no<br/>confusion over the three pairs of keys which are<br/>enharmonically equivalent (Cb/B, Gb/F#, Db/C#).<br/>the student understands the derivation of each of those<br/>from both sides of the circle, so it all makes sense.</p><p>of course, thru all of this i&apos;m always emphasizing to<br/>them that   i t   o n l y   w o r k s  i n<br/> T H I S   t u n i n g  !</p><p>my hope is that they&apos;ll get interested enough to want<br/>to learn about other tunings ... but until they do show<br/>an interest in that, i just discreetly keep reminding<br/>them that the tuning on their piano is only one out of<br/>a huge number that could be chosen, and that in many of<br/>those other tunings we get flats which are different<br/>from sharps, and the key of Gb might not be the same<br/>as the key of F#.</p><p>-monz</p><p>_________________________________________________________<br/>Do You Yahoo!?<br/>Get your free <a href="https://twitter.com/yahoo">@yahoo</a>.com address at <a href="http://mail.yahoo.com">http://mail.yahoo.com</a></p></div>
