They took on the task of working up 7 new pieces in three days.<br/>Some of the pieces were extremely difficult. For my piece, which was<br/>medium-difficult and only 7-8 mins long, they spent about 90 minutes of<br/>hard work on it, with me present. I would have liked another half-hour,<br/>though I&apos;m really not complaining about the job they did. Other tougher<br/>pieces had more than 3 hours spent on them with the composers, plus<br/>whatever time the Hilliards had spent before coming here (they had the<br/>scores for about a month, but of course they were very busy - they did at<br/>least read through everything and do some preliminary work before getting<br/>here). In any case, two or three of the composers wrote foolishly<br/>difficult pieces, unsuited to the group, and in one case one movement of a<br/>multi-movement piece had to be left out because the group couldn&apos;t get it<br/>prepared in time.</p><p>My point is, they might be terrific musicians and the world&apos;s greatest<br/>singers of a certain kind, but even 12-tet music, if written in a harmonic<br/>style they&apos;re not familiar with, can pose very difficult pitch problems<br/>for singers (and I&apos;m not even going to broach the subject of rhythm - oops<br/>I just did). Only one of the four members of the Hilliard ensemble who<br/>were here has perfect pitch sensitive to tiny fractions of a semitone -<br/>Rogers Covey-Crump, who also writes the tuning notes as companion to their<br/>CDs on the HilliardLIVE label. To get choral or vocal works done precisely<br/>in new tunings won&apos;t take simply the best singers, it will take people<br/>willing to dedicate a LOT of time to ear-training in the new systems. With<br/>over 100 concerts a year, the Hilliards or similar professional groups<br/>won&apos;t be able--or even interested, I imagine--to put in that sort of time.<br/>Unless you could pay them for a year. The really good singers are too busy<br/>succesfully earning their living, and the pretty good singers are too busy<br/>trying to become really good, really succesful singers.</p><p>Cheers --Jon</p></div><h3><a id=24229 href="#24229">ðŸ”—</a>JSZANTO@ADNC.COM</h3><span>6/1/2001 1:24:29 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Jon,</p><p>It was fascinating to see your &quot;behind the scenes&quot; note about working<br/>with the Hilliards.
