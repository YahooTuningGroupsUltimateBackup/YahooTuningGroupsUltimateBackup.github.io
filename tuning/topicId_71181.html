Today a new one<br/>easily costs a million dollars, and some cost many millions. Of course<br/>today pipe organs also increasingly get replaced by digital instruments.<br/>The quality of the sounds coming from these keeps getting<br/>better, but the most realistic I&apos;ve heard (a Walker digital) is still in the<br/>$100,000 range, and still doesn&apos;t match the real thing. Justification for<br/>the great costs associated with organs has something to do with the fact<br/>that they have (or have had at least in the past) a central function as a part<br/>of Christian worship.</p><p>If you choose one small numbered ET or whatever tuning for such an<br/>instrument other than 12, there is just no way to justify the cost. But<br/>would you be happy with the ability to play any and all intervals within<br/>1/2 a JND?  Still play your 12 tone music. Play all historical tunings.<br/>Play any ET, JI, whatever. It plays everything. This is the basic idea driving<br/>the Tonal Plexus. It can already do this with digital sounds. I&apos;m describing<br/>an acoustic version. It&apos;s insane, but possible. A more realistic idea is a<br/>something along the lines of the digital pianos and organs now being<br/>built, which do sound better than ever, but still not real.</p><p>What makes the Walker instruments sound so real is not just the high quality<br/>samples, but the amplification and speaker systems which are installed within<br/>standard organ chambers. There are a LOT of speakers pumping out a<br/>lot of acoustical power. The main problem with older digital instruments was<br/>not mainly that the sounds weren&apos;t convincing, but rather that 2 puny speakers<br/>cannot move enough air in any way remotely similar to the phenomenon of<br/>acoustically sounding pipes.</p><p>I recently tried out a lot of digital pianos. They all sounded... like digital pianos.<br/>None of them sounds like a real piano. And some of them were almost as<br/>expensive as a small acoustic baby grand!</p><p>Yours,<br/>Aaron Hunt<br/>H-Pi Instruments</p><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;J.Smith&quot; &lt;jsmith9624@...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; There is almost no way to say this without being taken to task for it,<br/>&gt; but IMHO something like the GPP is the *worst* possible solution to the<br/>&gt; problem of &quot;microtonal pianos&quot;.
