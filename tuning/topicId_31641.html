Because of this timbral diversity which we see in the<br/>&gt; worlds musical cultures - *no series should be looked at as better<br/>&gt; than any other*.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; When we begin to consider the complex interactions of mixed timbres -<br/>&gt; many of which may be inharmonic in nature, a whole new set of rules<br/>&gt; and thought must be applied, which might not readily fit what works<br/>&gt; for our beloved harmonic series and imaginings about the lower &gt;number<br/>&gt; integers.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; To be sure its one thing to consider only one &quot;series&quot; or partial<br/>&gt; structure at a time, but altogether another to think about many<br/>&gt; happening together in a real world, living, breathing musical<br/>&gt; context.

When the spectra become different from one<br/>&gt; another, does the idea suddenly become &quot;utterly meaningless&quot;?</p><p>J Gill writes:</p><p>Jacky, thank you (and I mean that!) for &quot;goring&quot; my &quot;sacred cow&quot;. Helps keep calcium deposits to a minimum to let go of one&apos;s own &quot;seriousness&quot;, noting that &quot;Nature (in its indifference) favors not the lowly mathematician&quot;...</p><p>Nevertheless, it seems (to me) that Paul (in the paragraph quoted directly above this paragraph) asks some good questions.</p><p>A (theory, or knowledge-claim) of spectral &quot;un-commonality&quot; or &quot;deep complexity of interelatedness&quot; may well adequately express that perhaps some are &quot;not seeing the forest for the trees&quot; (where it comes to direct practicable applicability in the *act* of making sounds). And, such a tangible (musical) product *is* the subject.</p><p>I do *not* utilize my conceptual ideas about music when *playing* music, and I do agree that the vast complexity of the spectral components presents very daunting as well as humbling limitations upon one&apos;s abilities to generalize in making any assumptions.</p><p>However, there seem to be some &quot;guidlines&quot; which you, yourself follow (as to certain choices of scales and scale &quot;pitch-ratios&quot;, etc.). I&apos;ll bet that you would not refer to those as &quot;useless&quot; (because they constitute valuable tools with which to present your musical ideas).</p><p>While humility is (without debate) a quality, and not a liability in this world - it seems (to me) that the (possibly meaningless, but who is to say?) world of mathematical expression (the hallmark of conceptual reductionists, theorizers, and speculators) should (as a form of human expression), be afforded a similar respect as you (I would think) would, as a practicing musician engaged in the act of *making sounds* (and very interesting ones, at that!).    :)</p><p>Some difference do exist between these parallel endeavors. You would not (I presume) dream of telling me that, after listening to your upcoming CD, I should expect mathematical &quot;solutions&quot; to suddenly, effervescently just ... jump out of the page at me, giving me the insight of Euler (pouring out pages of revolutionary mathematical breakthroughs on a daily basis).</p><p>The experience of listening to your upcoming CD makes a direct &quot;connection&quot; to the matter of your &quot;making sounds&quot;. While such is no small wonder, that activity does *not* purport to say more about the nature of things (or claim to be instructive in the art of numerical analysis).</p><p>However (and please do correct me if I am off-base here), perhaps you are feeling (?) that when mathematicians set about determining (or at least, in some manner, tending to enjoy &quot;recommending&quot;) certain alignments (and successions and combinations thereof) in pitch, they should (at least) *attempt* to tackle the &quot;entire enchilada&quot; (as it stands, warts, non-harmonic energy, and all)?</p><p>Somewhere between sinusoidal and cosinusoidal &quot;twinky sounds&quot;, and the overwhelming spectral forest of a symphony, one (at least hopes, perhaps futily), that some conceptual structures may prove to be useful in aiding the processes of tuning and tonal selections in time by persons actually engaging in the action of making interesting sounds.</p><p>Few are surprized when few (if any) of a collection of persons necessarily agree as to the musical &quot;value&quot; (to them as listeners) of a musical piece performed by you, me, or anyone else. We recognize (hopefully) the futility of attempting to impose an &quot;aural template&quot; upon another (as if they could be thou). I have no expectations or hopes that others would necessarily share my love for blues shuffles and loathing of polka music, etc.</p><p>So, perhaps it comes as little of a surprize that it seems that the business of mathematical conceptions surrounding a human activity which, itself (in the absence of any mathematical gadgets at play) cannot be tethered (by description utilizing language) in a manner which does justice to what is a (necessarily subjective) human perceptual process - the act of listening to one&apos;s own (or another&apos;s) &quot;musical sounds&quot;.</p><p>Nevertheless, I (personally) am very interested in concepts which *do* (at least to an extent surpassing sin/cos sound sources) possibly lend some insight into a more comprehensive (albeit not necessarily total) &quot;viewpoint&quot; (you might say &quot;earpoint&quot;) of the &quot;elephant&quot; of complicated composite musical spectrums. They are not presented (I hope) in what seems a dictatorial fashion, but may bring you some joy (perhaps only whimsical or visually aesthetic) at some point (you being a self-professed lover of pattern and symmetry, yourself).</p><p>Only Jacky will know whether Jeremy&apos;s (occaisionally, perhaps) interesting diagrams of pitch-ratios have direct meaning to the joy which Jacky finds in making sounds. And I would not have it any other way! I&apos;m really glad that you are there doing what you are doing, and hope to see and hear more of your ideas about music, and what you find to be your personal likings, dislikings, and style!</p><p>Pontifications and intolerance in general are poisionous to a creative environment... Viva la difference, and I hope that you (might) enjoy some of the fruits of my &quot;nerding-out&quot;, my friend!</p><p>Sincerely,  J Gill    :)</p></div><h3>paulerlich &#x3C;paul@stretch-music.com&#x3E;</h3><span>12/19/2001 12:04:54 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In tuning@y..., &quot;unidala&quot; &lt;JGill99@i...&gt; wrote:</p><p>&gt; As a result of the &quot;step-size&quot; ratio beween any (successively<br/>related) pair of ratios in the &quot;Farey series&quot; being &quot;superparticular&quot;<br/>ratios,<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; can it be said that:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; IF all of the elements of a set of &quot;step-sizes&quot; (from which one<br/>plans to derive scale pitch-ratios) are &quot;superparticular&quot; ratios<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; THEN the scale so derived from that &quot;superparticular&quot; set of of<br/>step-size ratios will contain ONLY &quot;Farey successive&quot; scale pitch-<br/>ratios?</p><p>As long as 1/1 is one of your pitch-ratios, this should hold.

This music does not necessarily deal with<br/>&gt; concepts of &quot;spectral commonality&quot;,</p><p>Well, I might argue that it does, but rather than trying to eliminate<br/>beating, Gamelan tuning-timbre combinations seek to acheive prominent<br/>beating within a certain range of beats per second, independently of<br/>register. This effect, impossible to achieve in a tuning-timbre<br/>combination that repeats itself exactly every octave or every ______,<br/>may be a way of getting &quot;expressiveness&quot; out of the metallophones of<br/>the Gamelan, which are incapable of vibrato. The beating rates in<br/>question are not too different from the vibrato rates we find in our<br/>coloratura singers and violinists in the West.</p><p>The concept of a just octave, in which second-order beating slows to<br/>a standstill, is well known to Gamelan musicians, who call<br/>it &quot;pleng&quot;. Different degrees of stretching and contracting of the<br/>octave, which will vary by register to achieve the desired rate of<br/>second-order beating, are applied quite consciously and intentionally<br/>by Gamelan tuners, if Daniel Wolf is to be believed.</p><p>&gt; The implications of why this is so - I feel - should not be to<br/>&gt; quickly overlooked, and personally I see it as yet another rich and<br/>&gt; fertile field to explore. It seems on some level to be an &quot;art of<br/>the<br/>&gt; ear&quot; - music tuned by ear, and I&apos;ve heard it said that there are as<br/>&gt; many Gamelan tunings as there are Gamelan orchestras.</p><p>There are definitely identifiable _regional_ tuning tendencies,<br/>though.</p><p>&gt; In Gamelan<br/>&gt; music, it is usually not the goal to tune out the beats, but to<br/>&gt; actually and deliberately have beating in the music - it is a<br/>&gt; characteristic feature of this music. Again - *it beats*,</p><p>Let it beat!</p><p>&gt; and it is<br/>&gt; not necessarily about RI/JI, Spectrum Tuning, ETs or whatever -<br/>yet -<br/>&gt; it sounds gorgeous. That it is as ancient as it is,</p><p>Gamelan tuning as practiced today may have very little to do with<br/>Gamelan tuning a century ago.</p><p>&gt; and as beautiful<br/>&gt; to the ear as it is, to me, implies a very wide open set of<br/>&gt; possibilities for tuning.</p><p>Yes it does. And I think Jeremy is also seeking to open the set of<br/>possibilities for tuning, relative to the &quot;norm&quot; in the English-<br/>speaking world (and much more) of 12-tET. 12-tET *beats* too, and the<br/>majority of professional musicians in our culture are quite attached<br/>to that beating, such that JI sounds &quot;insipid&quot; to them. Jeremy is, it<br/>seems to me, interested in laying a foundation for a new (or perhaps<br/>old) system of music, based on a concept which some people in our<br/>subculture _do_ find a musically desirable direction, whether from<br/>the experience of hearing a barbershop quartet singing perfectly in<br/>tune, or playing with analog synthesizers, or what have you . . .</p><p>&gt; As I was jokingly showing yesterday, 22 EDO does not actually fit<br/>&gt; into the harmonic series template,</p><p>If I were to take this seriously, I&apos;d say that 12-tET was arrived at<br/>in our culture partly because it does give an &quot;acceptable&quot; (after<br/>some painful historical struggles) fit to the first 6 harmonics, and<br/>22-tET is something I like because, among other things, it gives an<br/>equally &quot;acceptable&quot; fit to the first 8, or even 12, harmonics.</p><p>&gt; Suppose in a musical setting you have multiple instruments playing<br/>&gt; together, and each of these has radically different partial<br/>&gt; structures, say for instance you are using a combinanation of tuned<br/>&gt; gongs, and strings - just for an imaginary scenario. Well - you<br/>&gt; perform and FFT on the gongs, and you find that from gong to gong<br/>&gt; each one has an entirely different partial structure from the next,<br/>&gt; some having what is nearest to the 2nd partial is in the range of<br/>&gt; 1155-1240 cents, and the partial nearest to the 3rd harmonic of the<br/>&gt; strings is between a range of 1855-1940 (these are typically what<br/>one<br/>&gt; might see looking at gong spectra),</p><p>I&apos;m shocked to hear that gongs have their 2nd and 3rd partials so<br/>close to harmonic series values. Are you sure about this?</p><p>&gt; so in this imaginary scenario,<br/>&gt; are we looking for a tuning that features spectral commonality, or<br/>is<br/>&gt; it best to try to tune by the fundamentals?</p><p>I&apos;m not sure what &quot;tuning by the fundamentals&quot; means, but certainly<br/>one could, if it suited one&apos;s musical goals, look for a Sethares-like<br/>solution where the maximum possible amount of spectral commonality is<br/>acheived. You could easily tune a bunch of gongs so that they all<br/>shared a common partial, for example.</p><p>&gt; Tuning by the<br/>&gt; fundamentals on tuned idiophones may not always be the best<br/>solution,<br/>&gt; as the 2nd and 3rd harmonics may be prominent partials and may be -<br/>&gt; as in this scenario - totally different from the accompanying<br/>string<br/>&gt; harmonics.</p><p>In this scenario, they are suprisingly close to those from the<br/>accompaying string harmonics, but that may not be relevant since the<br/>strings may not be playing the same fundamental pitches as the gongs.</p><p>&gt; So - where we may be designing tunings for harmonic series timbres:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Where they are being used with a complex blend of inharmonic<br/>timbres,<br/>&gt; the tuning *is not going to display spectral commonality*.</p><p>Hopefully everyone understands this -- if not, it&apos;s time they did!</p><p>&gt; I think more times than not there is a &quot;style&quot; and<br/>&gt; personal subjective views which come through our scale<br/>constructions,<br/>&gt; which either do - or perhaps should reflect what we are trying to<br/>&gt; achieve with, or in, our music.</p><p>Absolutely.</p><p>&gt; And here, what works for one, might<br/>&gt; not work for all.</p><p>Here, hear.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Well - that you are exploring this, and have the good nature that<br/>you<br/>&gt; show, will insure that I will be following along with what you<br/>show,<br/>&gt; because spectral tuning represents one of the most important facets<br/>&gt; tuning to me. Especially interesting to me will be to see when we<br/>&gt; approach the issues of complex timbral interactions.</p><p>In our *Western* symphony orchestra, we have a wide variety of<br/>timbres. Yet the strings have perfectly harmonic spectra, the reeds<br/>have perfectly harmonic spectra, and the brass have perfectly<br/>harmonic spectra. Outside the orchestra, the piano and guitar are<br/>surely our most important instruments (out of the ones that we<br/>_tune_), and their spectra are only very slightly inharmonic.<br/>Although such sounds may fall flat to your ears, surely you can<br/>understand why a Westerner might begin his or her theoretical<br/>explorations by assuming harmonic spectra!</p></div><h3>jpehrson2 &#x3C;jpehrson@rcn.com&#x3E;</h3><span>12/19/2001 6:13:16 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In tuning@y..., &quot;paulerlich&quot; &lt;paul@s...&gt; wrote:</p><p><a href="http://groups.yahoo.com/group/tuning/message/31663">http://groups.yahoo.com/group/tuning/message/31663</a></p><p>&gt; &gt;Curiously,  J Gill<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; No -- but what seems to be the case very often, is that when one<br/>&gt; comes up with such a scale in the form of a periodicity block, one<br/>&gt; has quite a few arbitrary choices to make as to which version of a<br/>&gt; particular scale degree one wants (the different versions differing<br/>&gt; by a unison vector), and then _one such set_ of arbitrary choices<br/>&gt; does lead to a scale with superparticular step sizes.</p><p>Hi Paul...</p><p>Well, that&apos;s pretty *mysterious* isn&apos;t it?
