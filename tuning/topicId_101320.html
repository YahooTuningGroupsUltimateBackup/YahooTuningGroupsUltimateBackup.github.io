I&apos;ve been trying to teach<br/>you this for years now :)</p><p>The only thing is that vals exist that aren&apos;t the patent vals. For<br/>example, the patent val for 17-equal in the 5-limit is &lt;17 27 39|,<br/>which maps the major third to the 353 cent &quot;neutral third&quot; sized<br/>interval. However, there&apos;s also the &lt;17 27 40| val, which maps the<br/>major third to the 424 cent &quot;supermajor third&quot; sized interval. There&apos;s<br/>also the &lt;17 12938129831 -15| val, which is a bit absurd, but still<br/>exists, mathematically.</p><p>At any rate, it turns out that the 17-equal val that has the lowest<br/>error over all 5-limit dyads is actually &lt;17 27 40|, despite that &lt;17<br/>27 39| is the patent val. Of course, you might also decide that<br/>17-equal doesn&apos;t support the 5-limit at all, and treat it as a<br/>2.3.7.11.13 temperament. Then the val you&apos;d use is &lt;17 27 48 59 63|,<br/>where the columns reflect 2, 3, 7, 11, and 13 respectively, skipping<br/>5. A val that reflects a subgroup in this way is sometimes called an<br/>&quot;sval.&quot;</p><p>&gt; &nbsp;&nbsp; The advantage of this is...when you know how far off the primes are...you know how far off simple musical ratios like 3/2 (5th) and 5/3 (6th) are likely to be and can quickly choose EDOs according to which ratios they represent well.</p><p>It&apos;s also just a way of seeing where each prime lays out in JI for<br/>every equal temperament.</p><p>&gt; &nbsp;&nbsp; In addition, even though 2/1 maps with no error in an EDO...3/1, 5/1...will have error.&nbsp; That error is the comma.&nbsp; Hence even though 2 maps perfectly to an EDO, 3 doesn&apos;t, so there is always a comma where the EDO&apos;s representation of 3/2 meets 2/1.</p><p>Vals don&apos;t say anything of tuning. You can always stretch an EDO if<br/>you want so that 3/1 or 5/1 is pure and 2/1 is not. They&apos;re more<br/>abstract and represent where, in an EDO, you&apos;re saying the tempered<br/>primes are. Once you map the primes you can see what commas vanish, or<br/>even mix two EDOs together to get a rank 2 temperament.</p><p>&gt; &nbsp; That&apos;s where I get a bit confused...as I&apos;d think the error of the prime 3 vs. its representation in 12EDO to the 12th power would represent the error of its intersection with 2/1...the error also known as 80/81.&nbsp; But I&apos;m still not sure...</p><p>No, the difference between 12 3/2&apos;s and a few octaves is the<br/>Pythagorean comma, or 531441/524288. 81/80 is the difference between 4<br/>3/2&apos;s and one 5/1, or the syntonic comma, and it defines meantone<br/>temperament. Both vanish in 12-equal. Here&apos;s proof:</p><p>81/80 is 3^4/(2^4*5). Another way to look at this is 2^-4 * 3^4 *<br/>5^-1, or |-4 4 -1&gt; for short. This is called a &quot;monzo&quot; and is the<br/>other important part of all of this.</p><p>So the patent val for 12 is &lt;12 19 28|. Let&apos;s apply the homomorphism:<br/>&lt;12 19 28|-4 4 -1&gt; = (12)*(-4) + (19)*(4) + (28)*(-1) = 0. So it looks<br/>like 81/80 maps to 0 steps of 12-equal. Now let&apos;s see what happens to<br/>3/2: &lt;12 19 28|-1 1 0&gt; = (12)*(-1) + (19)*(1) + (28)*(0) = 7, and<br/>indeed 3/2 is 7 steps out of 12.</p><p>-Mike</p></div><h3>genewardsmith &#x3C;genewardsmith@...&#x3E;</h3><span>8/19/2011 8:34:23 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, Mike Battaglia &lt;battaglia01@...&gt; wrote:</p><p>&gt; The only thing is that vals exist that aren&apos;t the patent vals.

So far I already see much of<br/>what helped me earlier this week, both on that page and in other responses<br/>to this thread. Until I get a chance to dive deeper, here are a couple<br/>thoughts related to accessibility:</p><p>1. My newbiness didn&apos;t understand until the other day that when y&apos;all say<br/>&quot;primes&quot; you&apos;re often referring directly to the prime ~harmonics~ (not just<br/>the prime numbers). Your email the other day went to the trouble to spell<br/>out &quot;3/1&quot;, &quot;5/1&quot;, etc. (right after referring to &quot;the primes&quot;), and I had an<br/>&quot;oh doyy!&quot; moment. It&apos;s a simple notion, makes complete sense that you&apos;d say<br/>it that way, and it&apos;s been very common in the lingo I&apos;ve read for months ...<br/>but if everyone is using the shorthand without defining it, a newb won&apos;t<br/>necessarily make that connection (until he realizes and feels so dumb).<br/>There are probably other reasons I wasn&apos;t seeing that, but anyway.</p><p>2. Similarly related to what Mike and Gene have been saying about ranks,<br/>different kinds of vals, non-patent vals, etc... I&apos;m starting to get that<br/>stuff, maybe, but I need to grasp onto something more concrete first.<br/>Assuming your purpose in the intro/beginning of an article is to be more<br/>accessible, it&apos;s often essential to say something like &quot;this gets more<br/>complicated in practice, but ignore that for the moment&quot; or &quot;exceptions to<br/>this will be covered later&quot;. As the son of an EE, and as someone who&apos;s spent<br/>the last 2+ years of professional life turning myriad engineers&apos; expert<br/>gobbledygook into readable documentation, I have an all-too-keen sense of<br/>this sort of thing :-)</p><p>3. A thought on organization. A &quot;procedural&quot; or &quot;tutorial&quot; approach has been<br/>very helpful in getting me over the humps (&quot;this is your starting point,<br/>then you count the steps to 3/1 to obtain this value, then this goes here,<br/>OK, now you&apos;ve got a val! Let&apos;s look at it...&quot;) -- see your email from<br/>earlier this week. Right now, the article examples do that, but they sorta<br/>flip-flop between 12edo and 31edo. I&apos;d recommend running the *whole process*<br/>for 12edo, as an intro to the val concept, lay down the patent val with a<br/>few numbers (e.g. 2^(19/12) = 2.99661...). Then set them aside. At this<br/>point the newb is still thinking &quot;OK, looks good, whatever you say...&quot;. Then<br/>run it again for 31edo, generate the new val and corresponding numbers, and<br/>then compare them to each other. This gives an opportunity to show how vals<br/>convey useful information -- i.e. THIS number here shows that 31edo has<br/>better approximations of just intervals in THIS limit than 12edo, etc. --<br/>then use these already-fleshed-out examples to build on the concepts and get<br/>into the complications.</p><p>Hopefully the above reveals some of my misunderstandings, and I&apos;ll hear<br/>about it...</p><p>Jason</p><p>On Fri, Aug 19, 2011 at 21:17, Jake Freivald &lt;jdfreivald@...&gt; wrote:</p><p>&gt; **<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I&apos;ve updated the patent val page to include examples of the way I&apos;ve come<br/>&gt; to think of patent vals.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; <a href="http://xenharmonic.wikispaces.com/Patent+val">http://xenharmonic.wikispaces.com/Patent+val</a><br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; This is the kind of thing I would have liked to have seen back when I was<br/>&gt; starting to work through these things.

Werckmeister is also<br/>defined by the &lt;12 19 28| val, but just happens to be an irregular<br/>tuning for it - but these are both &quot;rank 1&quot; temperaments, because<br/>every note in it is generated by a single generator (1 step out of<br/>12). Meantone, on the other hand, is rank 2, because every note in it<br/>is generated by a combination of a generator and a period, or &quot;two<br/>generators&quot; if you&apos;re really hip. You could potentially have an<br/>irregular tuning for meantone where the fifths are different sizes,<br/>but it would still be a rank 2 temperament.</p><p>If you start with 5-limit JI, you have 3 dimensions - one for 2, one<br/>for 3, and one for 5. So 5-limit JI is a rank-3 &quot;temperament&quot; (to use<br/>the term liberally). If you temper out 81/80, the entire &quot;5&quot; axis is<br/>now reachable by sequences of 4 steps along the &quot;3&quot; axis and -4 steps<br/>along the &quot;2&quot; axis, and so for all intents and purposes it no longer<br/>exists as an independent degree of freedom. The 5 axis is now<br/>redundant, and there are only two truly free dimensions in the system<br/>- one representing 2 and one representing 3, with the axis for 5 being<br/>&quot;encoded&quot; into the other two axes. This is the meantone lattice.</p><p>Not so coincidentally, meantone is a temperament that has a generator<br/>of 3/1 and a period of 2/1, which are the axes that we&apos;re left with<br/>above.

This means that the identity element<br/>can be represented in more than one way as well, which I assume means<br/>there&apos;d have to be more than one identity element... (?) If I<br/>understand this then I&apos;ll better be able to express my question about<br/>torsion above.</p><p>&gt; &gt; I thought that the p-adic valuation for each prime would be 1... what<br/>&gt; &gt; does this mean? Do you mean for each prime up to some limit?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; No, I mean you get an infinite list of p-adic valuations, one for each prime, and that is your basis.</p><p>OK, I see. So you mean our basis would be |1 0 0 0 0 0 0 ...&gt;, |0 1 0<br/>0 0 0 0 0 ...&gt;, etc.</p><p>&gt; &gt; I don&apos;t understand this until I know what you mean by p-adic<br/>&gt; &gt; valuations giving you the basis for a free subgroup above... I was<br/>&gt; &gt; envisioning a setup where you defined a rank-n temperament by giving n<br/>&gt; &gt; elements in what you called the Baer-Specker group.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Certainly, but then I ask why not just stick to a finite limit group which contains them?</p><p>Because limits can be messy and cause problems, especially when you<br/>start looking at subgroups of limits. What&apos;s the best val for 13-equal<br/>in the 5-limit? How about the 7-limit? How about the 11-limit? It<br/>changes. How about the infinite limit?</p><p>I also just feel like it would be cool to work out :)</p><p>&gt; Otherwise, you&apos;d<br/>&gt; &gt; need to define an infinite - 1 amount of commas to define a rank-2<br/>&gt; &gt; temperament, which I&apos;m not sure how to formalize.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; It&apos;s not formalizing it which is the problem, but dealing with the resultant mess.</p><p>The comma &quot;81/80&quot; by itself already has a resultant mess. We&apos;ve been<br/>dealing with the resultant mess by saying &quot;this is the 7-limit 81/80<br/>planar temperament&quot; or &quot;this is the 5-limit 81/80 linear temperament&quot;<br/>or &quot;this is the 7-limit 81/80 and 49/48 linear temperament.&quot;</p><p>I simply wonder if there&apos;s another way to deal with it that doesn&apos;t<br/>involve limits and subgroups, so that we don&apos;t have a million<br/>different temperaments for the same essential thing. We&apos;d be at the<br/>point where we&apos;re finding what the best mappings are across all primes<br/>for some MOS, and there&apos;d be no point to ever go beyond that. Sure,<br/>there&apos;d still be utility in limits, but this would be fun too.</p><p>-Mike</p></div><h3>Mike Battaglia &#x3C;battaglia01@...&#x3E;</h3><span>8/22/2011 2:44:11 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>On Sun, Aug 21, 2011 at 8:44 PM, genewardsmith<br/>&lt;genewardsmith@...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; I don&apos;t understand this until I know what you mean by p-adic<br/>&gt; &gt; valuations giving you the basis for a free subgroup above...

Suppose I use<br/>a slightly sharp 3/2, maybe 709.091 from 22 EDO or 703.03030 from 99 EDO.<br/>That yields 436 or 412 cents, respectively -- still major / supermajor<br/>thirds, but not really 5/4 thirds.</p><p>I guess this is like any mapping process: There&apos;s a judgment call involved.<br/>When you map a 696.8-cent fifth and get a 7/4 of 968 cents, that works; when<br/>you map a 709.091-cent fifth and get a 7/4 of 1091 cents, it doesn&apos;t. You&apos;ve<br/>introduced too much error into the primes for it to work right. Just like a<br/>12 EDO val of &lt;12 19 21| would be valid as a val, but a lousy map in the<br/>5-limit.</p><p>Which means, getting back to using sharp fifths, I should be able to adjust<br/>mappings if things get out of whack. Instead of &lt;0 1 4 10|, I could use &lt;0 1<br/>9 20|. Using the 22-EDO fifth, that would get me a major third of 381.819<br/>and a harmonic 7th of 982 cents. It would also mean that there is a<br/>substantially &quot;higher complexity for 5 and 7&quot; in that tuning, if I<br/>understand this correctly.</p><p>&gt; the first matrix consists of the 7-equal patent val on top of<br/>&gt; the 12-equal patent val, and the rref version of it also happens<br/>&gt; to be the period/generator mapping for meantone, which is also<br/>&gt; the temperament common to 7-equal and 12-equal, and hence the<br/>&gt; 7&amp;12 temperament.</p><p>I&apos;ve wondered what people meant by things like &quot;7&amp;12 temperament&quot;, but I was<br/>chewing on other things.
