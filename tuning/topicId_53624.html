I understand the reasons for this.  Still, I wonder if there is some software out there that will do what I want.  I suppose it would have to analyze each chord and microtune accordingly.</p><p>Is there any hope?</p><p>Thanks,</p><p>Susan Tucker</p></div><h3><a id=53625 href="#53625">ðŸ”—</a>Carl Lumma &#x3C;ekin@lumma.org&#x3E;</h3><span>6/18/2004 12:47:23 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Hi Susan!</p><p>&gt; Attached is a midi file of a chorale-style variation on Rhythm<br/>&gt; changes.</p><p>I got two files, crhythm.mid and crhythm1.mid.
