I rather enjoyed it, but the people around me who even noticed just<br/>sort of grimaced or made a comment like &quot;Damn noisy traffic!&quot;. A while ago I<br/>heard a buzz of a streetlight that was so rich in harmonics that I could<br/>pick out a few and hum them. I&apos;ve recently begun tapping or flicking<br/>everything that looks as though it might resonate in search of new sounds.<br/>People who saw me doing these things just gave me the same look as any<br/>tuning addict must be used to. The study of alternate tunings, particularly<br/>JI, has taught me to appreciate the beauty inherent in natural (or<br/>artificial!) things, and if everyone did this, I think the world would be a<br/>better place.</p><p>I love you guys!</p><p>Stay Tuned,<br/>    Keenan P.</p></div>
