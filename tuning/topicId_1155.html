Isn&apos;t it enough to require that<br/>&gt; the primary ratios be sufficiently accurate and consistent? Then the<br/>&gt; secondary and tertiary ratios will still result from stringing together<br/>&gt; the primary ratios in progressions -- whether these secondary and<br/>&gt; tertiary ratios approximate JI well is irrelevant since they are not<br/>&gt; supposed to be consonant.</p><p>Yes, we&apos;ve argued it before, several times--I don&apos;t know if I&apos;m just not<br/>explaining things well, or if there is some unstated basic premise on<br/>which we disagree, or what.  If my previous attempts haven&apos;t been enough<br/>for you, I&apos;ll have to undertake a more thorough explication, and frankly<br/>I don&apos;t know exactly when I&apos;ll get the time.  I can&apos;t seem to toss off<br/>long, carefully thought-out essays the way Margo can.  I&apos;ll try to do it<br/>soon though.
