It&apos;s really great to see this type of a meaty multiple list<br/>member collaboration.</p><p>One quick point or question on a first read through... I don&apos;t think<br/>it&apos;s always clear that Golden Mediant algorithm and the mediant method<br/>are essentially asking opposite questions; in other words, I&apos;m seeing<br/>the Golden Mediant as a wonderful little closed-form shortcut to a<br/>sort of &quot;eventuality of mediant iterations.&quot; But isn&apos;t the mediant<br/>method in its usual application generally being asked to give the<br/>*least* complex (or most stable) point between two others, with only<br/>successive iterations eventually closing in on maximally complex zone?<br/>It seemed as though all these points are nicely delineated at one<br/>point or another but perhaps not consistently clear -- maybe I should<br/>just read through it a few more times!</p><p>So, what do the significantly larger discrepancies between these two<br/>mediant methods mean (the 5/4 6/5 example for instance)? That the<br/>traditional mediant is a non trivial distance from the actual point of<br/>maximum complexity (i.e., the Golden Mediant)... that would be my<br/>take.</p><p>Anyway, looking forward to reading it a few more times, and once<br/>again -- my compliments to the chefs!</p><p>d</p></div>
