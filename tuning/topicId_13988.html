An awful lot of<br/>linguistic explication had already gone on before you saw that chart, and<br/>I&apos;m sorry to say you have still misunderstood it.</p><p>Note that Wilson calls it a &quot;scale tree&quot;, not an &quot;interval tree&quot;. The<br/>fractions represent fractions of an octave (logarithmic, melodic), not<br/>frequency ratios (linear, harmonic). Can you confirm this Kraig?</p><p>Of course the mathematics of &quot;Noble Mediants&quot; is the same in both cases,<br/>but whether or not any particular noble number has any significance or not,<br/>(and what that significance is), is quite different in the two cases.</p><p>In the logarithmic-melodic case (Wilson&apos;s case), the noble fractions of an<br/>octave are scale generators. An interval whose frequency ratio is 2^n<br/>(where n is a noble number) is stacked on top of itself (and octave-reduced<br/>as necessary) until it forms a scale which has Myhill&apos;s property (that<br/>there are only two interval sizes in any interval class). And so it has<br/>only two sizes of scale step. This is called a &quot;Moment of Symmetry&quot; (MOS)<br/>by Wilson. This property is important for appreciation or recognition of<br/>melody, not harmony.</p><p>MOS scales can of course be generated with non-noble fractions of an<br/>octave. A concise statement of the significance of these noble numbers in<br/>the logarithmic-melodic case eluded me (and apparently Paul Erlich) until<br/>Dan Stearns provided it. (I&apos;m assuming it is true. I haven&apos;t checked it)</p><p>Dan Stearns wrote:<br/>&gt;I&apos;m only considering scales where L/s = phi to be &quot;Golden scales&quot;...<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;I think the one overriding characteristic of these scales is that they<br/>&gt;put a given Ls index into an arrangement where interval class<br/>&gt;distinction is uniquely &quot;optimized&quot;. So if clear, uniquely defined<br/>&gt;interval classes are your thing, these generalized Golden scales would<br/>&gt;seem to be of interest.</p><p>One should note that the good melodic properties of noble generators are<br/>very &quot;broadly tuned&quot;. i.e. It may be quite acceptable for ratios between<br/>steps of a scale (in cents) L/s may be anywhere from about 1.3 to 2.5<br/>(centered around phi) and still give recognisable scales. The precise best<br/>value for a generator is far more strongly determined by the harmony. i.e.<br/>the desire to approximate simple ratios to obtain consonances. A 1% error<br/>can be intolerable here. As Carl Lumma (approximately) said &quot;Dissonances<br/>are easy to find; consonances you really have to work at.&quot;</p><p>Margo Schulter wrote:<br/>&gt;Above all, I&apos;d like to confirm that Erv&apos;s scale tree indeed maps the<br/>&gt;neo-Gothic region, &quot;walks the plateau,&quot; and very directly and<br/>&gt;beautifully presents the &quot;Noble Mediant&quot; concept.</p><p>In the linear-harmonic case the significance of _some_ noble numbers, as<br/>direct frequency ratios (n, not 2^n), is that of local maxima of<br/>dissonance. But just as, when looking for local minima of dissonance, whole<br/>number ratios a:b cease to be significant beyond some level of complexity<br/>(a*b), so noble mediants between two ratios cease to give local maxima of<br/>dissonance when any of the ratios go beyond that same level of complexity.</p><p>For example Noble_Mediant(4:5, 7:9) = (4+7phi):(5+9phi) gives a local<br/>maximum of dissonance but Noble_Mediant(4:5, 11:14) does not. Somewhat<br/>misleadingly, Noble_Mediant(7:9, 11:14) _does_ give a local dissonance<br/>maximum. But that is only because it is exactly the same number as<br/>Noble_Mediant(4:5, 7:9).</p><p>Margo, In your excellent articles on Keenan Pepper&apos;s neo-Gothic tuning you<br/>make use of noble mediants for both purposes (melodic and harmonic). I<br/>think the reader would benefit from a clear distinction between the two.</p><p>Also, part 2 may give the reader the impression that I would consider the<br/>neo-Gothic near 17-tET to be somehow ideal because it maximises the<br/>complexity/dissonance of the pythagorean major third. I think your<br/>excellent spectrum chart could benefit from also showing the points that<br/>correspond to maximally complex minor thirds and major and minor sixths.<br/>This would show that they cannot all be maximised together and would, I<br/>think, suggest a compromise somewhere around 29-tET.</p><p>Regards,<br/>-- Dave Keenan<br/><a href="http://dkeenan.com">http://dkeenan.com</a></p></div><h3><a id=14023 href="#14023">ðŸ”—</a>D.Stearns &#x3C;STEARNS@CAPECOD.NET&#x3E;</h3><span>10/5/2000 11:08:07 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>David C Keenan wrote,</p><p>&gt; Margo, In your excellent articles on Keenan Pepper&apos;s neo-Gothic<br/>tuning you make use of noble mediants for both purposes (melodic and<br/>harmonic).

While I was first<br/>posting these ideas of a generalized Kornerup (so to speak), Paul<br/>Erlich and Kraig Grady pointed out that this idea was essentially<br/>synonymous with Erv Wilson&apos;s &quot;Golden Horagrams of the Scale Tree&quot;.<br/>Having it all framed in my mind somewhat differently I had failed to<br/>see this...</p><p>Anyway, from the perspective of Keenan P&apos;s original post and all that<br/>followed, maybe it would be nice to have two terms that relate to<br/>mediants (logarithmically or linearly) in a sequential (i.e., low to<br/>high) and reversed (high to low) Fibonacci expansion.

Personally I&apos;d like to say that one is optimizing<br/>something while the other is optimizing another (similar to the<br/>strictly proper/improper distinction that occurs in the logarithmic<br/>case), but least I hopelessly wander too far off into the dreaded<br/>blear of &quot;numerology&quot; &lt;Hi Dave!&gt;, I&apos;ll leave it as it is and see what<br/>the cognoscenti say.</p><p>--Dan Stearns</p></div><h3><a id=14064 href="#14064">ðŸ”—</a>David C Keenan &#x3C;D.KEENAN@UQ.NET.AU&#x3E;</h3><span>10/5/2000 6:30:50 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Dear Dan,</p><p>There is no need for two functions, such as the sort of &quot;left&quot; and &quot;right&quot;<br/>noble mediants you seem to be wanting.
