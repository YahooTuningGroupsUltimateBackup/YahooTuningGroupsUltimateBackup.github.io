SQRT(5/4).  The &quot;mean&quot; happening here (for the nomenclature) doesn&apos;t have anything to do with splitting 10/9 and 9/8.  D is the geometric mean between C and E, exactly.  It&apos;s a &quot;mean tone&quot;, two of which make up a major third, whatever size that major third happens to be.  Any interval can be bisected, the same way that any angle on paper can be bisected.  [Whether that point is also mean between two JI positions is irrelevant, since those JI are not in the scale!]  All we&apos;re deriving here is the square root of whatever interval is our major third by definition.</p><p>Demonstration on a harpsichord: set up any C-E of your choosing (as long as it still sounds like a major third!).  Tune C down to G as a pure 4:3.  Tune E down to A as a pure 3:2.  Tune D (diatonic step between the original C-E) from both G and A, such that the beat rate of the fifth G-D is exactly 2/3 the beat rate of the fourth A-D.  D is therefore constructed exactly mean between C and E, geometrically, being a mean tone--half the distance from C to E.</p><p>That D can then be used in turn to construct the proper G and A above the existing notes.  Put the G so the C-G fifth beats 2/3 as fast as the D-G fourth.  Put the A so the D-A fifth beats 2/3 as fast as the E-A fourth.  Retune our previous (temporary) G and A to match these, as pure octaves.  Now we have C-G-D-A-E all in a regular meantone layout (exactly) defined by whatever size the original C-E third happened to be.</p><p>That beat-rate technique always works (listening to the simplest partials of the tone, as we harpsichord tuners do).  [On harpsichord the inharmonicity of the strings is negligible this low in the harmonic series.]  Wherever x, y, and z are three notes in positions 1, 2, and 5 of a diatonic scale: when x to z beats exactly 2/3 as fast as the beating of y to z, the fifths x to z to y are equal in size (geometrically).  That is, all three notes are elements of some meantone set.</p><p>So, knowing the positions of any two of the three notes, one can derive the third note by moving it until the beat relationship is correct.  For example, if we have already established the fifth A and E in whatever meantone we&apos;re setting on the keyboard, we can get the B between them by moving it until the fourth B-E beats 3/2 as fast as the fifth A-E.  Then we can use this B and the E a fifth below it to set up our F#, and etc etc etc etc as far around the circle as we want to go...all generated by the original size of our C-E major third plus this single operation (the sesquialtera beat rate) to bisect it.  All these are regular and exact &quot;meantone&quot; tunings: every note exactly splits the correctly spelled major third around it, and all the fifths are the same size as one another.</p><p>All the regular meantone tunings also have a similar musical character to one another: the difference being of degree, not shape.  How fast do the resulting major thirds beat (might be 0, or might be wide, or might be narrow)?  If our &quot;major third&quot; happens to something ludicrously large such as 420 cents or as small as 350 (or whatever), making the whole thing laughably bad for tonal music, an exact meantone layout can still be derived.  C-E doesn&apos;t have to start at 386.3137138648 (or whatever) cents.  It could be any rational or irrational value anywhere in the range &quot;sounds like a major third&quot; [which I haven&apos;t bothered to calculate....]...obviously an infinite set there.  And that&apos;s apart from considerations such as choosing G# instead of Ab, making a bigger infinity!</p><p>Back to my quip above about the JI 9/8 and 10/9 not being in the scale.  Start with some random C-E, for example 390 cents (*).  One can tune D as a 9/8 from C, but then D to E is not 10/9; or one can tune the D as 10/9 from C but then D to E is not 9/8.  They don&apos;t both fit, because we didn&apos;t start with 5/4.  (Truisms here, all.)  So, if we stick the meantone D of 195 cents in there, it matters not one whit that it happens not to bisect 10/9 and 9/8, and not to be half a syntonic comma away from either of them, for that matter...they can&apos;t both be in that same room at the same time anyway!</p><p>=====</p><p>To boil all this down and recap: &quot;meantone&quot; doesn&apos;t mean &quot;half a syntonic comma away from 9:8 and/or 10:9&quot;; but only that there&apos;s no such thing as a major tone and a minor tone available anymore, since we&apos;ve split the major third (whatever size it is) by square root (geometric mean) instead of anything to with JI superparticular ratios.  Instead of those two other expected tones with some claims to purity, we have a mean tone.</p><p>Where our major third is not 5:4, and we&apos;re deciding where to put the intervening note, the tones either have to be a major tone plus garbage, or a minor tone plus garbage, or two carefully regulated and equal pieces of garbage, or two sloppy pieces of garbage.  &quot;Meantone&quot; charts that third course there, controlling the impurity and turning it into the melodic virtue of smoothness.  Do-Re and Re-Mi become the same size.  So do Fa-Sol, Sol-La, and La-Ti along with those.  Therefore it becomes very easy for music to modulate (or &quot;mutate&quot; to use the older term from hexachord parlance) by moving from one diatonic scale to a different one, where the intervals will be the same sizes.  No bumpiness, no foreign exchange rates.  Need to transpose the whole piece?  Merely move it over, and then make sure we don&apos;t go off the edge into the wrong enharmonic set of accidentals.</p><p>=====</p><p>(*) Major third of 390 happens to be between the major thirds of 1/5 syntonic comma and 1/5 Pythagorean comma meantone, but whatever it is, it can be split.  There&apos;s nothing magical about simple fractions of any particular comma; it&apos;s all a continuum.  Numbers are merely measurements.  There&apos;s nothing magical about cents, either.  All the regular meantones can be set up very easily by ear, using the procedure above.  Establish one major third of whatever size one&apos;s taste says sounds good; doesn&apos;t even need to be measured by any machine, necessarily.  Then whack it into equally-sized four fifths in between, and keep going with that same size of fifth until there are twelve different notes.  All the resulting major thirds (spelled correctly) will be the same size as the original one; all the tones will be mean within their major thirds; a regular meantone tuning.  There&apos;s no need to *count* beats to any specified standard of time; merely to observe that they are 3-against-2 of some other beat rate nearby.  Triplets against duplets, like in music.</p><p>Regular 1/3, 1/4, 1/5, 1/6, 1/7, 1000/7001, 0.237563, etc etc comma meantone (whichever comma) are all manifestations of the same shape, varying only by intensity of the same character.  Merely pick your size of generating fifth, or your size of generating major third, and everything else follows automatically.  Two notes automatically become twelve, or more if your instrument has split keys.  The lighter the fifth-tempering gets, the more one can start cheating by playing enharmonically wrong notes and having them serve more or less decently as one another.</p><p>=====</p><p>Anyway, such a debate about the proper use of the term &quot;meantone&quot; has been going on for centuries already, and will probably continue to do so after we&apos;re all gone.  I&apos;m in the camp that define it as I&apos;ve described above.  SQRT(5/4) is merely one special case within an infinite set...namely the case where the tone happens to bisect 9:8 and 10:9 also, as coincidence, but not the case that merits the restrictive name &quot;meantone&quot;.</p><p>Meantone, to me, is a shape; not only that single point.  The splitting of major thirds equally is the main thing.  If it happens to come into eclipse with the splitting of just-intonation intervals (a completely different game) at one coincidental point, so be it; but I don&apos;t see why we should use the word &quot;meantone&quot; to mean only that eclipse point, when the special case&apos;s nomenclature &quot;1/4 syntonic comma meantone&quot; describes that single point so nicely within the whole family of possibilities, and presents the whole family at once.  The whole family sounds similar, varying only by intensity.</p><p>If somebody wants to invent a special keyboard that is able to play all three of the equally spaced notes 9:8, SQRT(5/4), 10:9 above a given tonic, fine, but that has nothing to do with the diatonic music I care about or can play on my harpsichord.  If I&apos;ve tuned a meantone layout onto it, my G is exactly between F and A, being a mean tone between them.  I needn&apos;t tell anyone what size the interval F-A is; it&apos;s still a meantone tuning.  D is mean between C and E.  It&apos;s mean within the diminished fifth B-[D]-F.  D also happens to be mean within the augmented fifth Bb-[D]-F#.  D is mean within the minor seventh A-[D]-G, and within the major ninth G-[D]-A, and so forth; and within the diminished third C#-[D]-Eb.  Meantone-tuned notes are exactly halfway between other notes that are also available to be played; that&apos;s why it&apos;s called &quot;meantone&quot;.</p><p>Brad Lehman</p></div><h3>monz &#x3C;monz@tonalsoft.com&#x3E;</h3><span>8/21/2004 2:46:05 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>hi Brad,</p><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, Brad Lehman &lt;bpl@u...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; as it turns out, modern Euro-centric harmonic theory<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; evolved within a meantone context, and the particular<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; variety of meantone was generally assumed to be<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; 1/4-comma (which is the &quot;true&quot; meantone tuning -- i.e.,<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; it really does have a &quot;tone&quot; [major-2nd] which is<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; exactly midway in pitch between the two JI major-2nds<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; of ratios 10/9 and 9/8; other &quot;meantones&quot; are approximately<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; mean but not exactly).<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I have to speak up about an issue of nomenclature here.......<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; There&apos;s an infinite set of regular and exact meantone<br/>&gt; layouts available to 12-note keyboards.  1/4 syntonic comma<br/>&gt; merely happens to be the interesting case where a *pure*<br/>&gt; major third is the thing being bisected, by geometric<br/>&gt; mean.

All this accomplishes is to delay the disasters for<br/>about 15 seconds further into the piece.  As soon as we run into<br/>C#-F, G#-C, D#-G, and A#-D, it&apos;s as bad as before.</p><p>So, then I tried the thing I mentioned yesterday: putting C#/Db mean<br/>between A and F, G#/Ab mean between E and C, D#/Eb mean between B and<br/>G; and D-F#-Bb-D as 400s.  Still awful: a bunch of little wolves in<br/>F-Bb and F#-B and elsewhere.</p><p>Next thing to try was (still keeping all the naturals where they are<br/>in 2/7 comma &quot;meantone&quot;)...B-F#-C# and F-Bb-Eb slightly wide, and<br/>then the mean G#/Ab between the C# and Eb.  That is, the wolf is<br/>chopped into many small bits and nothing&apos;s horrible anywhere.  The<br/>four brightest triads are of course still the misspelled B-Eb-F#,<br/>F#-Bb-C#, C#-F-G#, and G#-C-Eb as in all the regular (&quot;meantone&quot;)<br/>temps, by this point having a character somewhat resembling their<br/>counterparts in regular 1/5 or 1/6.  Eb and E major are also both<br/>quite bright, being on the outskirts of the bad neighborhood.  The<br/>whole piece can be played without disaster, and there&apos;s still a very<br/>strong &quot;center of gravity&quot; when we hit C, F, or G major.  All the<br/>other major triads have increasingly colorful beating in them.</p><p>The bigger problem, though, is that some of our hexachords (so nicely<br/>demonstrated in all twelve possible positions) are quite bumpy,<br/>melodically.  If we were going to end up with our wolf-puppy major<br/>triads at the four classic positions anyway, letting the music more<br/>or less circulate through all keys, why not just do the whole keyboard<br/>in 1/5 or 1/6 to begin with instead of messing around with something<br/>as tight as 2/7 on the naturals....?  The hexachords end up sounding<br/>smoother, the major triads of A, E, Eb, and Bb relax a bit, and the<br/>whole thing is less startling overall.</p><p>Not that this exercise has proven anything new.  In regular<br/>temperaments, the sharper the generating major third is (while less<br/>than 400), the better the accidentals are able to proxy for one<br/>another in misspelled situations; that&apos;s a truism.  Why not just do a<br/>nice 1/5 or 1/6, optionally stick a mean G#/Ab into it to slice the<br/>slight remaining wolf, and be done?  With or without that final step<br/>of the G#/Ab, these are all &quot;meantone&quot; *in character* and they all<br/>have the same shape, varying only in intensity, when playing tonal<br/>music.</p><p>So I went ahead and raised G, D, A, E, and B, and lowered F...while<br/>not touching the accidentals from the previous step.  Voila, we&apos;re<br/>back in something very close to regular 1/5 or 1/6, and the only<br/>remaining harshness is in the classic places of the misspelled major<br/>triads and some canine derivative in the Eb-x-C# kennel.</p><p>Run the whole experiment backwards from 1/6 or 1/5 comma regular.<br/>Leave C where it is, and also as many of the naturals and early<br/>sharps as you can get away with; dink everything else around to make<br/>the fifths purer at some expense of the major thirds.  That&apos;s what<br/>&quot;Werckmeister III&quot; is!  Starting from a &quot;meantone&quot; (i.e. regular)<br/>organ, which by 1690 meant it could be anywhere between 1/4 and 1/6<br/>or even lighter, you can leave C and three or four other notes of<br/>each octave essentially where they are (within 2.5 cents), and not<br/>have to rebuild the whole instrument!</p><p>1/6 syntonic: leave C, C#, F#, G, and B.<br/>1/6 Pythagorean: leave C, E, F#, G, and B.<br/>1/5 syntonic: leave C, E, F#, G.<br/>1/5 Pythagorean: leave C, D, E, G.<br/>1/4 syntonic: leave C, D, G, A.</p><p>&quot;Werckmeister III&quot; is therefore a remarkably clever way to renovate a<br/>regular organ without having to rebuild all of it, but merely 7 or 8<br/>of the notes in each octave (and mostly in the direction of making<br/>the notes flatter, i.e. adding pipe material, rather than cutting into<br/>the precious legacy instruments).  It&apos;s brilliant, really, under such<br/>conditions of converting existing instruments.  It still does not<br/>solve the basic problem of improving those same four classic major<br/>triads from the outer darkness; it merely takes some of the edge off<br/>them.  It doesn&apos;t really make chromatic music more playable, but only<br/>less egregiously offensive in the situations of enharmonically<br/>misspelled notes...making the parishioners wince less intensely at<br/>such moments, and therefore giving them some appreciable return for<br/>the investment of the conversion.</p><p>&quot;Werckmeister IV&quot; gives an alternate way to give regular 1/6 Pyth<br/>comma a facelift, if the goal is to stick more closely to diatonic<br/>music in the commonest keys.  &quot;Werckmeister V&quot; is an alteration of<br/>regular 1/8 Pyth comma.</p><p>These three are good for organ conversions, to save expense.  They&apos;re<br/>inferior, though, if the goal is to start from scratch and do<br/>something more musically flexible and subtle.  As with any job,<br/>there&apos;s a big difference in results between settling for a half-assed<br/>compromise (trying for minimum rework) and seriously rethinking the<br/>basic design in other ways.</p><p>Brad Lehman<br/>(not really a fan of Werckmeister III&apos;s sound....)</p></div><h3>Gene Ward Smith &#x3C;gwsmith@svpal.org&#x3E;</h3><span>8/24/2004 12:32:12 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;Brad Lehman&quot; &lt;bpl@u...&gt; wrote:</p><p>&gt; I set up my Italian virginal in regular 2/7 syntonic comma to check<br/>&gt; out Gene&apos;s question about Bull&apos;s &quot;Ut re mi fa sol la&quot;.

How clueless are<br/>harpsichordists and organists supposed to be, especially at such a<br/>high level of achievement as Doctor Bull?  Anybody who has ever sat<br/>at a harpsichord with a tuning hammer, trying to set 1/4 comma fifths<br/>but accidentally making them too lightly tempered (i.e. getting too<br/>slow a beat rate), will hear the resulting wide major third and<br/>notice what it sounds like.  And, at least once or twice, he or she<br/>will continue onto the entire instrument to see what happens, and try<br/>some repertoire on it.  I don&apos;t see how John Bull or any other<br/>harpsichord player then or now would not know this, unless they&apos;ve<br/>had their tuning tasks hired out 100% of the time, or unless they had<br/>tin ears insensitive to pitch control.</p><p>Ditto for the dinking around in the wolf area, trying to make things<br/>more usable by nudging notes higher or lower to taste...this is<br/>Harpsichord Tuning &quot;101&quot; there, from a practical point of view.  The<br/>chimera is that practical players EVER stuck as closely to regular<br/>layouts as the theorists (then and now) would have us believe.<br/>Regular layouts are too restrictive, both melodically and<br/>harmonically, to get the job done in playing any substantially large<br/>body of repertoire.</p><p>Sure, different regular strains could be deployed on different<br/>occasions, or one could pick different dispositions for different<br/>pieces (quickly retuning all the Eb to D#, for example) as Barbour<br/>would have it in his speculations.  But that &quot;bag of golf clubs&quot;<br/>approach DOES NOT work for organs or for fretted clavichords, where<br/>the alteration of temperament takes quite a bit more work than<br/>turning a tuning pin.  One must either set up a system where proxy<br/>enharmonics sound decent, or live with a bunch of occasional and<br/>random-sounding dissonances in music that looks perfectly diatonic on<br/>the page, or stick to a very restricted set of keys and modulations.<br/>This is where practice meets theory and overrules it.  It&apos;s theory&apos;s<br/>duty to catch up, not to squelch practice.</p><p>&quot;Well-tempered&quot; tunings are not an invention of the 1690s; it&apos;s<br/>merely a theoretical codification of the continuum that had already<br/>been happening in &quot;ordinary&quot; tuning for at least a hundred years<br/>already...the tasteful nudging up of some or all of the sharps, and<br/>nudging down of some or all the flats, until they&apos;re somewhat<br/>passable as one another.  And, that&apos;s starting from whatever strain<br/>of regular meantone best suits the milieu and the music, i.e.<br/>sensitivities of musical taste; and not necessarily 1/4 syntonic<br/>comma.  Start with something mostly regular, dink it around carefully<br/>(by taste and experience and training) until it sounds even better in<br/>the music to be played, and there&apos;s your ordinary tuning.</p><p>The alternative is to believe that musicianship ever moved in<br/>stair-step jumps: that everybody used regular 1/4 comma, until<br/>Werckmeister (or whoever) realized suddenly one day that things must<br/>be reformed drastically.  But the 16th and 17th century music itself<br/>argues against such a view; the exotic enharmonic notes are in there.<br/>Why would composers write notes that deliberately make the instrument<br/>sound unresonant, or tune the instrument in such ways that make the<br/>music sound randomly strident, for generations?  Did they all have no<br/>taste at all?  Isn&apos;t it much simpler to conclude, from the music,<br/>that they had practical ways of tuning so things sounded fine, and<br/>just didn&apos;t bother to write those methods down because they were so<br/>common, everybody knew them?  Practice is not restricted only to the<br/>things that theorists make up and square off with mathematical<br/>nicety, or have bothered to write down at all!</p><p>Brad Lehman</p></div><h3>Brad Lehman &#x3C;bpl@umich.edu&#x3E;</h3><span>8/25/2004 1:40:22 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;Gene Ward Smith&quot; &lt;gwsmith@s...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt; --- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;Brad Lehman&quot; &lt;bpl@u...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; I think I&apos;ve figured it out now; I suspect it has very much to do<br/>&gt; &gt; with<br/>&gt; &gt; your choice of timbre in the orchestration!

For the recording on harpsichord and virginals, he used<br/>the following tuning (reconstructed here from the description he gives in the<br/>liner notes):</p><p>  0: 1/1                        &#x9;0.000 unison, perfect prime<br/>  1: 256/243                   &#x9;90.225 limma, Pythagorean minor second<br/>  2: 193.157 cents         &#x9;193.157<br/>  3: 32/27                   &#x9;294.135 Pythagorean minor third<br/>  4: 5/4                      &#x9;386.314 major third<br/>  5: 4/3                      &#x9;498.045 perfect fourth<br/>  6: 45/32                    &#x9;590.224 diatonic tritone<br/>  7: 696.578 cents            696.578<br/>  8: 128/81                   &#x9;792.180 Pythagorean minor sixth<br/>  9: 889.735 cents           &#x9;889.735<br/> 10: 16/9                     &#x9;996.090 Pythagorean minor seventh<br/> 11: 15/8                    &#x9;1088.269 classic major seventh<br/> 12: 2/1&#x9;&#x9;&#x9;&#x9;1200.000 octave</p><p>Although the liner notes don&apos;t mention it, it turns out that this is<br/>Kirnberger, what we commonly think of as a not-very subtle, but usable,<br/>Baroque tuning !!!

Obviously, Zarlino in Italy talked about 2/7 comma, Pietro Aron<br/>talked about 1/4 comma, Salinas talked about 1/3 comma, and composers in<br/>Germany like Praetorius were talking about it as a standard tuning, and how<br/>one should go about laying the bearings of it.....but apparently not in<br/>England, which after all was somewhat isolated. The question remains--how<br/>isolated was England--was it enough that practical tuning ideas amongst<br/>Continental and island musicians were *not* shared.

But the 16th and 17th century music itself<br/>&gt; argues against such a view; the exotic enharmonic notes are in there.<br/>&gt; Why would composers write notes that deliberately make the instrument<br/>&gt; sound unresonant, or tune the instrument in such ways that make the<br/>&gt; music sound randomly strident, for generations?  Did they all have no<br/>&gt; taste at all?  Isn&apos;t it much simpler to conclude, from the music,<br/>&gt; that they had practical ways of tuning so things sounded fine, and<br/>&gt; just didn&apos;t bother to write those methods down because they were so<br/>&gt; common, everybody knew them?

(For what that&apos;s worth!)  In<br/>Schreiber/Grammateus&apos; layout, &quot;all the chromatic notes were exact<br/>meantones between their two natural neighboring notes, and the<br/>natural<br/>notes D, G, and A were also exact meantones between their two<br/>chromatic neighboring notes.  All the semitones in the Schreiber<br/>tempered Pythagorean were exactly the same size except for EF and BC<br/>which were smaller.  Therefore, the Schreiber Pythagorean Temperament<br/>has been called meantone temperament and also equal temperament.  It<br/>is an example of the equal type of temperaments that were used on<br/>lutes and viols in the sixteenth century.  In conclusion, the terms<br/>&apos;Pythagorean tuning&apos;, &apos;meantone temperament&apos;, and &apos;equal temperament&apos;<br/>have commonly been scrambled together in history.&quot;</p><p>But, just ahead of that on page 8, Jorgensen gave us: &quot;The term<br/>&apos;meantone temperament&apos; is a relatively new term that was invented by<br/>theorists long after the era of meantone temperament supremacy had<br/>passed.
