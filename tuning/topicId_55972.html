Unfortunately, I&apos;m now<br/>realizing that things are not gonna get much better in a short time and<br/>therefore I&apos;ll be not able to contribute as frequently as I used to.<br/>Moreover, soon I&apos;ll begin studying at a brand-new school (a high school) and<br/>I better don&apos;t try to think of what&apos;s all gonna happen there in the first<br/>year of my studies.<br/>I hope noone was looking for me here while I was away. Since I really don&apos;t<br/>know how long this will last, I just want to make you aware that I&apos;ll have<br/>to leave the list in a few days. But before I definitely take this step, I<br/>want to openly thank all of you who took some time to help me in various<br/>ways, especially Gene, Paul, and Monz, whose work meant a lot to me. Of<br/>course, from time to time I&apos;ll take a look what&apos;s happening here. I hope<br/>it&apos;ll not take too long till I come back. For now, good luck in your work<br/>and see you soon.<br/>Petr</p></div>
