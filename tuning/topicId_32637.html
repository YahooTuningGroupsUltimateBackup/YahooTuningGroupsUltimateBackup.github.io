[Ligon scale]<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; KG:<br/>&gt; &gt;     I also have to voice an objection to the idea of placing such<br/>&gt; artifacts under the interpretation of ET&apos;s or ratios and such unless<br/>&gt; there is reason to believe that this is the basis of construction. I<br/>&gt; am not trying to be insulting but i can&apos;t help thinking of the act of<br/>&gt; placing those myths around the world and comparing them to stories<br/>&gt; found in the Bible. Pardon my lack of imagination in coming up with<br/>&gt; such a harsh metaphor. It is even under our own western disciplines<br/>&gt; &gt; extremely unscientific. What we need to do is really look at these<br/>&gt; things and figure out what is going on instead of attempting to put<br/>&gt; them as square pegs into round holes.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; J:L:<br/>&gt; I completely agree. Although there may be some value in the<br/>&gt; comparative mathematical tools we use, when we are studying the<br/>&gt; tunings of other cultures we must take them as what they are, rather<br/>&gt; than try to impose another frames of reference onto them as if this<br/>&gt; is what they may be adhereing to. They should stand on their on<br/>&gt; merits.</p><p>I fully understand what both of you are writing about here.<br/>Part of the reason I work so hard with my own dissemination<br/>of tuning history and theory is because I&apos;ve seen first the<br/>understanding of African music and then the music itself<br/>become distorted because of analysis of it in terms of 12-EDO.<br/>These days, nearly all African music one hears is being played<br/>on western instruments, tuned to 12-EDO.</p><p>But I have to dissent with you both at least to some degree.<br/>I know the goals of many tuning theorists, myself included,<br/>lean towards finding out the most objective mathematical<br/>&quot;truth&quot; about historic tunings that may be found.  A very<br/>big part of my endeavor in this is to study the history of<br/>tuning itself.</p><p>Certainly, it&apos;s difficult to impose objectivity upon a study<br/>of something so ephemeral as music.  But if one tries to take<br/>into account as many factors as possible, and *includes them<br/>in his mathematical models*, then surely one will be coming<br/>as close as possible to the &quot;truth&quot;.</p><p>A goal of modern tuning theory is therefore not to &quot;impose<br/>another frame of reference&quot;, but rather, to find the proper<br/>frame of reference *from which* one may make a proper study<br/>of any given musical system.  It&apos;s often discovered that<br/>a certain individual or culture was doing something systematic<br/>that he/she/it never even knew about.  Humans thrive on<br/>communication and pattern recognition, and certainly these<br/>two things are present in all music and can be modeled<br/>mathematically.</p><p>-monz</p><p>_________________________________________________________<br/>Do You Yahoo!?<br/>Get your free <a href="https://twitter.com/yahoo">@yahoo</a>.com address at <a href="http://mail.yahoo.com">http://mail.yahoo.com</a></p></div><h3><a id=32675 href="#32675">ðŸ”—</a>Robert Walker &#x3C;robertwalker@ntlworld.com&#x3E;</h3><span>1/14/2002 5:09:52 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Hi there,</p><p>Actually, addition does have a meaning in music.</p><p>Harmonic sereis - continually adding 1<br/>1 2 3 4 5</p><p>Now if you start at 1/1 and add, say 1/5<br/>1+1/5 + 1/5 +...</p><p>you get<br/>5/5 6/5 7/5 8/5...</p><p>i.e. the harmonic series starting from the 5th harmonic.</p><p>Adding say 6/5 gives<br/>1 + 6/5 + 6/5 + ...</p><p>gives<br/>5/5 11/5 17/5 ...</p><p>i.e. every sixth harmonic from the fifth upwards.</p><p>Starting from say 3/2 instead of 1/1</p><p>3/2 + 6/5 + 6/5 + ...</p><p>then the easiest thing is to multiply by 2/3 to make the first<br/>term 1/1:</p><p>1/1 + 4/15 + 4/15 + ...</p><p>i.e. every fourth harmonic starting from the 15th upwards.</p><p>So if you start with a ratio and repeatedly add another ratio<br/>you always go up a harmonic series by a fixed number<br/>of terms at a time.</p><p>I added this to FTS some time back - ratio-wise additive scale steps, thinking<br/>it might give something completely new (and you never know, possibly<br/>musically interesting).</p><p>However, it only does so if the thing you are adding is irrational:</p><p>1 + g + g + ...
