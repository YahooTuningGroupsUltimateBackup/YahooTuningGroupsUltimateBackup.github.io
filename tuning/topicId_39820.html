My scale will play virtually<br/>&gt; any Western World music.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Pauline</p><p>Dear Pauline</p><p>I don&apos;t know which just tunings you&apos;ve read about but here are a few<br/>reflections to comment on your statement above.</p><p>I&apos;ve just finished nine intensive 9 - 12 hour days as Musical Director<br/>of a theatre group. All the music was in Just Intonation. I used a<br/>slendro and two pelogs throughout. See <a href="http://www.unsork.info/tuning">http://www.unsork.info/tuning</a></p><p>I was playing constantly throughout the nine days and the other<br/>musicians, cast members, were in contact with the instruments and hence<br/>the tunings, for hours each day. I would reckon that I can now speak<br/>with some authority on just scale usage.</p><p>One of my objectives was to produce a soundscape that couldn&apos;t be pinned<br/>down in time or geographical location, ie, non-Western, non-Eastern, and<br/>according to the audience in a question and answer session after the<br/>first show, I met with some measure of success. The suspension of<br/>disbelief was matched by a musical suspension of spatial and temporal<br/>reference.</p><p>Having said that some audience members heard strands of plainchant,<br/>others hints of raga, hardly &quot;modern&quot; musics.</p><p>Another thing is that I, or rather my ears, never tired of making music<br/>with the just scales. Every line and combination of motifs has a<br/>freshness and the tiniest variation in accent or contour becomes<br/>important. This compares favourably with how I used to feel after a week<br/>of performing Bach or Villa-Lobos on the guitar in 12 tet. Even great<br/>music left me jaded.</p><p>So I would thoroughly recommend that you try out some of the tunings I<br/>use because they now have some &quot;road muscle&quot; and I am delighted to say<br/>that they have few if any limitations, unless, as I suspect, you are<br/>referring to four part harmony of course. I would counter that the use<br/>of strings and of sustaining metallophones creates (IMHO) some of the<br/>most compelling harmonies you will ever hear. In this case you learn to<br/>create the harmonic language over hours and days of trial and error<br/>rather than by  prior knowledge of the theoretical harmonic resources of<br/>the scale, as in 12 tet.</p><p>Anyway, given what I&apos;ve said, subjective though it may be, I can&apos;t think<br/>what else you might want from a scale, so I would have to disagree with<br/>your statement.</p><p>Kind Regards</p></div><h3><a id=39822 href="#39822">ðŸ”—</a>prophecyspirit@aol.com</h3><span>10/21/2002 7:37:29 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>In a message dated 10/21/02 6:56:59 AM Central Daylight Time,<br/><a href="mailto:alison.monteith3@which.net">alison.monteith3@which.net</a> writes:</p><p>&gt; I can&apos;t think<br/>&gt; what else you might want from a scale, so I would have to disagree with<br/>&gt; your statement.<br/>&gt;<br/>What I want from a scale is a practical just scale that will accurately<br/>reproduce music written for tempered scales--MT, WM, ET, etc. that usually<br/>had 12 notes to the octave.

My JT scale merges three notes into 19<br/>per octave. As scales with only 12 notes to the octave make many grave<br/>compromises. The result is dissonant chords that in nature are very<br/>harmonious! A proper jsut scale has to provide harmonic minor 7th and 9th<br/>chords for each of the seven diatonic notes.</p><p>Pauline</p></div><h3><a id=39840 href="#39840">ðŸ”—</a>Jon Szanto &#x3C;JSZANTO@ADNC.COM&#x3E;</h3><span>10/21/2002 12:58:26 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Pauline,</p><p>--- In tuning@y..., prophecyspirit@a... wrote:<br/>&gt; Jim,</p><p>Must be the stars: Bill thought I was Joe, you think I&apos;m Jim... :)</p><p>&gt; My just scale has 22 notes per octave....</p><p>...and the rest. Right, I understand all of that. Your intended use is not in question at all, just that there are many other approaches, for many other kinds of music. By saying that other tunings &quot;limit&quot; their use, or create other impracticalities, you seem to imply that they are either less valid or less useful. I don&apos;t happen to agree with that.</p><p>In the least!</p><p>Cheers,<br/>Jon</p></div>
