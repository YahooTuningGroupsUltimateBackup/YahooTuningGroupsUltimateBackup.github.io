I am speaking here of<br/>the resultant ratios which describe the pitches of the notes of a<br/>given derived scale (as opposed to the ratiometric steps between such<br/>pitches, or the products of such pitches).</p><p>JG: Do you believe that ratios which describe the pitch of a given<br/>note of a scale (where superparticular, but comprised of large valued<br/>integers in the numerator and/or denominator, as opposed small valued<br/>integers) are any more (or less) &quot;useful&quot; than non-superparticular<br/>ratios which are similarly comprised of large valued integers in the<br/>numerator and/or denominator? Or is such &quot;utility&quot; only evaluatable<br/>with reference to such a ratio describing the pitch of a given note<br/>of a scale as it inter-relates in practice in conjunction with<br/>some/all of the scale&apos;s *other* pitches?</p><p>Hoping to hear from you,  J Gill</p></div><h3><a id=31388 href="#31388">ðŸ”—</a>Kraig Grady &#x3C;kraiggrady@anaphoria.com&#x3E;</h3><span>12/11/2001 3:27:19 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Page 2 is the epimores between the intervals on Page 1 Page 3 shows this in one diagram although<br/>the last line is messed up you can see it on page two.
