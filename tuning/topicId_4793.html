As I don&apos;t<br/>have a Mac I am unable to comment on the software at this time, but here<br/>is the URL, which I have also included in the Microtonal Software section<br/>of my page:</p><p><a href="http://www.geocities.com/SoHo/Lofts/7880/">http://www.geocities.com/SoHo/Lofts/7880/</a></p><p>John Starrett<br/><a href="http://www-math.cudenver.edu/~jstarret">http://www-math.cudenver.edu/~jstarret</a></p></div><h3>Drew Skyfyre &#x3C;drew_skyfyre@yahoo.com&#x3E;</h3><span>9/14/1999 12:03:36 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>I just checked it out.</p><p>From the doc :</p><p>&quot; This paper presents an easy way to play at least two microtonal systems<br/>(19-tone and 24-tone equidistant temperaments) almost immediately and with<br/>little investment. It is based on the velocity sensitivity of modern<br/>electronic keyboards. The idea is to change the pitch of a key by the way<br/>you hit it: if played soft, you get pitch 1; if played hard, you get pitch<br/>2. This system is basically intended to explore the 19-tone and the 24-tone<br/>temperaments. It works best on simple contrapuntal music and on simple<br/>chords.&quot;</p><p>The actual software is implemented using Opcode&apos;s Max. And, I deduce uses<br/>pitch bends to achieve the microtuning. It works. I&apos;m no keyboard player,<br/>but it&apos;s easy to use &amp; feels quite natural. It has options for 12/19/24 tone<br/>tuning, range, threshold, &amp; Proteus sysex tuning.</p><p>It is however $25 shareware. Much too much for something this tiny.</p><p>I&apos;m sure some of you have known about this technique, &amp; have used it, but<br/>it&apos;s news to me. Never even thought of it. Ingenious. It&apos;s an outstanding<br/>way to use tunings with more than 12 tones on 12-tone MIDI instruments like<br/>keyboards &amp; MIDI guitars. With Max it should be easy enough to roll your own<br/>version of this to use your synth&apos;s tuning tables, rather than pitch bends.</p><p>Ofcourse, keeping track of what you&apos;re doing in a sequencer&apos;s piano roll/<br/>notation display is another story...</p><p>- Drew</p><p>_________________________________________________________<br/>Do You Yahoo!?<br/>Get your free <a href="https://twitter.com/yahoo">@yahoo</a>.com address at <a href="http://mail.yahoo.com">http://mail.yahoo.com</a></p></div>
