I still find the concept of Moment of symmetry the most inclusive, especially because of the idea of the secondary levels which often are the more interesting scales. yet we have to acknowledge that it does not touch tetrachordal  scales especially the enharmonic. nor scales that involves notes in a very limited range. we have scales such as those produced by the &apos;Are &apos;Are in the Solomon islands that most ethnomusicologist is a highly developed and very old tradition. I have one set of these scales on my site in the world scale depository which i can&apos;t link to at the moment. Here one &apos;octave&apos; if you can call it that has 5 notes the next has 6. Since different instruments in these ensembles function differently, it stands to reason that the notes number might change. also with the scales we find of Ballophones in africa only certain notes are repeated in certain octaves . This has to do with the wide use of Tonal languages so what is expressed in the lower range in different than the upper so you will have basically a different scale as you play higher.<br/>So much is determined by context and the artistic expression of a people as a whole.
