The<br/>first reduction corresponds to a variation in axis elongation ratios and<br/>the second to a counterclockwise rotation. The invariance concerns the<br/>spatial location of the intervals between them and the convexity property<br/>is not changed by these two transformations.</p><p>                                     (2)</p><p>I hope you don&apos;t doubt that for me, the parallelopiped defined by N unison<br/>vectors in dimension N+1, is the fundamental unit of periodicity. This<br/>shape insure that there is no possibility to have inside it two intervals<br/>of the same class and the periodicity insure that all classes have a<br/>representant in this block.
