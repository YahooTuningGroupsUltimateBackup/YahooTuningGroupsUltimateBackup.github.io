I am sorry you friend had<br/>this experience but frankly it might say more about his own psychology than<br/>ours. When ever I hear anyone put a group of people a being the same,<br/>something rings of untruth. I cannot think of a more varied group of<br/>individuals than the performers on these two nights! Maybe your friend<br/>doesn&apos;t understand that performers sometimes can feel a bit vulnerable<br/>after they perform. Also maybe your friend didn&apos;t present himself in a way<br/>that was inviting. As far as the &quot;L.A. boys&quot; are concerned, there were some<br/>women involved as I remember.  Personally I remember talking to quite a few<br/>members of the audience afterwards but we were over our alotted time and<br/>had to pack up soon after the end. If it was during the concert, I had to<br/>run things so I was distracted.   As for talking about the tunings, it was<br/>not the place. We were doing concerts, not lectures. We have already talked<br/>about including lectures next year. But if he really wants to know, you can<br/>give him my web address as well as my e-mail address and I will be happy to<br/>answer anything he wants! I do it all the time as I play in the clubs.<br/>Sometimes to very young musicians who know little but talented and<br/>interested<br/>    The concerts were highly successful. We all had a lot of fun. We had<br/>two nights! As for myself I&apos;ve never sold so many CD&apos;s at any event. True<br/>we had no press coverage, but the press covers little here. When they do no<br/>one really pays attention. Its all word of mouth out here.<br/>    I&apos;m sorry you weren&apos;t included in this years show, there just wasn&apos;t<br/>room.<br/>Just what are you really saying Neil!</p><p>Neil Haverstick wrote:</p><p>&gt;<br/>&gt;    I just met a fellow who went to the Microfest in LA in May, and he<br/>&gt; related a story which I want to pass along, about his perceptions of the<br/>&gt; musicians he encountered. Sadly, what he had to tell me doesn&apos;t make the<br/>&gt; LA boys look too hot. Basically, when this man attempted to chat with<br/>&gt; some of the performers after the show, he felt that they were<br/>&gt; uninterested in talking to him, and seemed rather elitist...he said they<br/>&gt; kept to themselves, and were not interested in talking about their music<br/>&gt; or the tunings involved. He said he left depressed, and with a bad<br/>&gt; feeling about the scene in LA. And this is a man who has a real interest<br/>&gt; in learning about the world of tunings, the type of guy who wants to be<br/>&gt; involved as a performer (he is a musician, with an involvement in<br/>&gt; Chinese music).<br/>&gt;     Remember, this is his opinion, formulated on his experience at the<br/>&gt; Microfest...I don&apos;t feel he had any axe to grind; he genuinely was<br/>&gt; disappointed at the response he got. This bums me out immensely...first,<br/>&gt; elitism of any kind, in any field, sucks...second, I hate to hear of<br/>&gt; such an occurrence in the small world of microtones because we need all<br/>&gt; the help we can get to make this happen on a wider scale. And, if this<br/>&gt; dude was depressed, it&apos;s likely that others have had the same sort of<br/>&gt; experience as well. Too bad.<br/>&gt;    Also, a smaller point...he said no one talked about the tunings they<br/>&gt; used, or any of the theory behind why they did what they did...he was<br/>&gt; interested in learning about what was happening, but came away with<br/>&gt; little new knowledge. I put this post up as a public service to my<br/>&gt; fellow microtonalists, so perhaps we can avoid alienating people in the<br/>&gt; future at our gigs...Hstick</p><p>-- Kraig Grady<br/>North American Embassy of Anaphoria Island<br/><a href="http://www.anaphoria.com">http://www.anaphoria.com</a></p></div><h3><a id=3713 href="#3713">ðŸ”—</a>Paul H.

First of all, I am<br/>not reluctant to talk about my tunings which for the most part are Erv wilson&apos;s<br/>tunings. To due them justice, I allow everyone to get it from the horses mouth!<br/>That is what the Wilson Archive is. What more could anyone want! I have little<br/>control over what others say. James Joyce refused to deal with the press in<br/>general because as he said, &quot;they were always in a hurry to misrepresent you&quot;.<br/>Still I have always been willing to explain my tunings the best I can when<br/>asked.<br/>    I want to clear up one last thing here about this hearsay snootiness. I<br/>answered for the group of fine L.A. artists on the concerts. As far as I can<br/>remember, It was not me that the person talked to. Maybe this person went to<br/>the other night and talked to one of the out of towners. There are too many ifs<br/>in the first place for such a thing to be posted.<br/>    I hate to say this. Ivor would spend most of his concerts talking as<br/>opposed to playing, which I don&apos;t think worked, from the audiences point of<br/>view. He had more to say personally than was able to come out in such a<br/>presentation. Theroy was just one of them. But many thought that was all it was<br/>about<br/>    For those who see in music only the interaction of fomal relationships, I<br/>have the greatest pity in their &quot;lost of soul&quot; and poetic sense in art. That<br/>our arts are treated in such a fashion merely points out these losses in our<br/>society and civilization as a whole.<br/>    There are come strong differances between the microtonal music coming from<br/>around this hemisphere. But not always, so lets try to keep the REGIONARIES<br/>DISEASE to a minimum.</p><p>&quot;Paul H.
