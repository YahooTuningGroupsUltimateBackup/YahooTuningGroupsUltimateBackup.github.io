The wiki tells me that 2/19<br/>is a good generator, so I go to Scala, create a new linear temperament, and<br/>ask for a maximally even regular temperament with 9 or more notes using a<br/>generator of 126.326 cents.</p><p>My question has to do with &quot;number of fifths down&quot;.</p><p>I note that if I say &quot;8&quot;, I get<br/>  0:          1/1               0.000  unison, perfect prime<br/>  1:        126.326 cents     126.326<br/>  2:        252.652 cents     252.652<br/>  3:        378.978 cents     378.978<br/>  4:        505.304 cents     505.304<br/>  5:        631.630 cents     631.630<br/>  6:        821.022 cents     821.022<br/>  7:        947.348 cents     947.348<br/>  8:       1073.674 cents    1073.674<br/>  9:          2/1            1200.000  octave</p><p>...while if I say &quot;4&quot; (which implies 4 up as well), I get:<br/>  0:          1/1               0.000  unison, perfect prime<br/>  1:        126.326 cents     126.326<br/>  2:        252.652 cents     252.652<br/>  3:        378.978 cents     378.978<br/>  4:        505.304 cents     505.304<br/>  5:        694.696 cents     694.696<br/>  6:        821.022 cents     821.022<br/>  7:        947.348 cents     947.348<br/>  8:       1073.674 cents    1073.674<br/>  9:          2/1            1200.000  octave</p><p>...and these are modes of each other. Similarly if I use 8 generators up<br/>and zero down.</p><p>That leads to my question: Will this always be the case? It&apos;s not obvious<br/>to me that it will be, but half of the math around here isn&apos;t obvious to<br/>me. :) If the number of generators up and down &quot;doesn&apos;t matter&quot; in the<br/>sense that I can just hit Shift-Alt-A to see all of the modes of a given<br/>scale instead of trying different generators, that&apos;s a big time savings.</p><p>Thanks in advance,<br/>Jake</p></div><h3>Mike Battaglia &#x3C;battaglia01@...&#x3E;</h3><span>12/29/2011 9:12:56 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>On Fri, Dec 30, 2011 at 12:08 AM, Jake Freivald &lt;jdfreivald@...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; That leads to my question: Will this always be the case?

At least in the rank-2 case, everything is wrapped up in a neat and tidy package - shifting the generator chain does the same thing as shifting the &quot;root&quot; of the scale.</p><p>But this is an interesting question because it really points out something we can&apos;t get to work in rank-3 (and higher). In a rank-3 temperament there are two independent kinds of generator, so in the analog of a MOS / DE scale there&apos;s not only &quot;number of generators up&quot; and &quot;number of generators down&quot;, there&apos;s also &quot;number of generators left&quot; and &quot;number of generators right&quot;, where I picked &quot;left&quot; and &quot;right&quot; just because they&apos;re a different pair of directions than &quot;up&quot; and &quot;down&quot;. If you change these independently you usually don&apos;t get a mode of the original scale in the sense of being a cyclic permutation. You can get a scale with a different pattern of steps, which Mike Battaglia has termed a &quot;dome&quot; (because it&apos;s like a mixed-up &quot;mode&quot;).</p></div>
