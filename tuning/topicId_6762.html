You know you can&apos;t just make a blanket<br/>statement like that.  While McCartney&apos;s original version of<br/>_Eleanor Rigby_ is considered by many (myself included) to be<br/>a masterpiece of pop music, it doesn&apos;t have anywhere near the<br/>emotion or charisma of Ray Charles&apos;s blistering version.  And<br/>Ray&apos;s version is *very* different: much funkier, and where<br/>the original was for voice and string quartet only, Ray used<br/>piano, bass, drums, guitars, and the Rayettes (his female<br/>background singers), in addition to his own voice. Just<br/>one example among hundreds, and that&apos;s just of McCartney&apos;s work...</p><p>&gt; The best cover is Hendrix doing dylans &quot;All along the watchtower&quot;</p><p>Oh yes... that&apos;s *really* a good one!</p><p>&gt; a friend saw dylan play recently and his version sounded like<br/>&gt; it was changed by Hendrixs version. Dylan is for the most part<br/>&gt; a Dramatist, not a composer.</p><p>I think I remember reading somewhere that Dylan himself said<br/>that Jimi&apos;s version of the song was what it should have sounded<br/>like in the first place.</p><p>-monz</p><p>Joseph L.

As far as<br/>&gt; I know, they all, with the possible exception of Stravinsky,<br/>&gt; freely ripped off other works in pursuit of their own vision,<br/>&gt; not to mention profit.  I think it very likely that they weren&apos;t<br/>&gt; hypocritical enough to demand that their own compositions be<br/>&gt; left untouched.  Am I wrong about this?  If I am, it might<br/>&gt; make a difference in what I retune.</p><p>Mahler certainly had the same attitude you do.  He continually<br/>revised all of his symphonies (up to the 8th) as long as he<br/>was able to rehearse them, and after making a change during<br/>one rehearsal, he said &apos;All hail to the conductor of the<br/>future who is not afraid to alter my score to suit the conditions<br/>of his performance&apos;, or something to that effect.</p><p>(I believe this was first recorded by Natalie Bauer-Lechner<br/>in her book; it certainly appears somewhere in Henry-Louis<br/>de La Grange&apos;s _Mahler_, volume 1 (1973) ).</p><p>Besides the fact that he&apos;s my favorite composer, that&apos;s another<br/>reason why I have no compunction about my plans to retune<br/>my MIDI-file of his _7th Symphony_.</p><p>As a conductor, Mahler himself made many re-orchestrations<br/>and other revisions of the symphonies and operas he performed,<br/>usually for dramatic reasons in the operas and acoustical<br/>reasons in the concert programs.</p><p>He was famously vilified for his version of Beethoven&apos;s _9th_,<br/>as well as for his version of Beethoven&apos;s _F-minor Quartet,<br/>op. 95_ for string orchestra.  But his versions of the Schumann<br/>symphonies are gorgeous.</p><p>BTW, it&apos;s high time we changed the subject line of this thread.</p><p>-monz</p><p>Joseph L.

If I thought this was winding down, I was WAY off the mark!!</p><p>[Jonathan M. Szanto, TD 429.1:]<br/>&gt;There are so many threads that I find odd in the recent discourses, but<br/>&gt;mainly from one particular angle: a willful disrespect for a composer&apos;s<br/>&gt;own desires. How many times must we hear &quot;if he/she had only known/had<br/>&gt;the resources we have at our disposal today&quot;? Well, we do, but he/she<br/>&gt;didn&apos;t!  How presumptuous of the &apos;arranger&apos;, then, to willy-nilly<br/>&gt;change much of the intrinsic fabric of a piece.</p><p>Is your finger pointed at me, Jon?  I HAVE made the point that we have<br/>tools now available that were not available before, but I think I&apos;ve<br/>also been careful to make the point that it&apos;s impossible to know what<br/>the original composer would think, either of the idea in general or of<br/>any given specific offering.  Of course, that knife cuts two ways, yes?</p><p>Presumptuous?  I will accept &apos;audacious&apos;, but your choice of words<br/>illustrates the stark difference in our feelings about messing with<br/>existing works, a difference you go on to make more explicit in your<br/>post.</p><p>&gt;To reiterate: there are large areas of the musical landscape that are<br/>&gt;ripe for plucking (and retuning, and rearranging, etc.), but I have yet<br/>&gt;to see even one of the proponents actively acknowledge the existence of<br/>&gt;musics/performance works that stand *on their own*, without<br/>&gt;&apos;improvement&apos;.</p><p>Does it have to be one or the other?  I don&apos;t think it does.</p><p>&gt;Really now, it is a hell of a lot easier to draw muso-strokes by saying<br/>&gt;&quot;J. S. Bach, arranged by Josephine Blow&quot; than it is to come up with a<br/>&gt;composition on your own.</p><p>Is it?  I&apos;m not sure that&apos;s true.  And if it is, so what?  Does that<br/>make one valid, one invalid?</p><p>&gt;To say that all music is fair game for your aural playground is not<br/>&gt;correct.</p><p>I have to disagree, with the caveats presented elsewhere in this post.</p><p>&gt;To state that all composers would welcome your contributions to their<br/>&gt;compositional experiments is disingenuous and rude.</p><p>Has anyone actually made that claim?</p><p>&gt;So: tweak your tuning tables, change your temperments, alter your<br/>&gt;instrumentations (and vocalizations), substitute lyrics, change<br/>&gt;languages, do whatever you want. Just be honest about it: if the<br/>&gt;composer came up to you and asked you to please not do that to their<br/>&gt;work, would you tell them to piss off or respect their wishes?</p><p>I&apos;m willing to withdraw any posting I&apos;ve made if it can be shown that<br/>the original composer hated anyone touching his/her work.  However, I<br/>would at the same time support some other arranger&apos;s &quot;right&quot; to tinker<br/>with even the works of someone who asked that it not be done, even if I<br/>personally believed the attempt completely wrong-headed (copyrights and<br/>original composer&apos;s lifetime exempted, as I&apos;ve stated).</p><p>[Daniel Wolf, TD 429.2:]<br/>&gt;Experiment, by all means, every musician does it!  Most do it in<br/>&gt;private, as a means of digging out details in the music, but when it is<br/>&gt;more than details and done in public, please present it as an<br/>&gt;experiment or a new composition and not as a reproduction of the<br/>&gt;original composer&apos;s intent.</p><p>Truly I think I have made it clear that everything I have done is an<br/>experiment.  I DON&apos;T know whether the original composer would like it.<br/>If I haven&apos;t been careful to make that clear, or have written something<br/>that could be taken as straying from that stance, I apologize.  (which<br/>post(s) was that, again?).</p><p>&gt;If you wish to do that, then the level of evidence required to support<br/>&gt;the claim is extremely high.</p><p>I agree!  Much higher than I would claim!</p><p>&gt;Your Bach retunings are interesting, but to my ears only demonstrate<br/>&gt;how much his voice leading technique was determined by the resources<br/>&gt;and limitations of temperaments.</p><p>I accept your criticisms and thank you for basing them upon actual<br/>listening, which would seem to be considered an unnecessary requirement<br/>for judgement among some members of this list.</p><p>[Kraig Grady, TD 428.10:]<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt;I believe Stravinsky complained bitterly about the changing of his<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt;music in Fantasia and i remember he included the &quot;blackmail&quot; letter<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt;from Walt himself telling him his copywrights meant nothing in the<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt;U.S.</p><p>[JdL:]<br/>&gt;&gt;Dang!  I suppose this means I shouldn&apos;t post the killer &quot;Rite of<br/>&gt;&gt;Spring&quot; piano reduction I got from a list member!</p><p>[David Beardsley:]<br/>&gt;Think you could send a copy over this way? It&apos;s a life long favorite.</p><p>If no list member thinks doing so would offend Stravinsky or otherwise<br/>be unacceptable...??? :-)</p><p>[Johnny Reinhard, TD 429.21:]<br/>&gt;Perhaps &quot;defacing&quot; is what you had in mind after all, yes JdL? :)</p><p>That was the idea of the quip...</p><p>&gt;The difference is conceptual between our 2 positions.  I find myself<br/>&gt;aligned with Jon, Daniel, Kraig, and others that raise alarm at too<br/>&gt;much, or ill-advised tinkering.  Believe me, this is as unlikely a<br/>&gt;bunch of bed-fellows as I can imagine on this list.</p><p>&gt;You seem to see the composition as existing only in its set of<br/>&gt;directions through music notation.  Not true and my metaphor still<br/>&gt;stands about sculpted work.  I don&apos;t feel you have the right to call it<br/>&gt;my sculpture if you alter it before an exhibition...even if you own it.<br/>&gt;Sorry if this burdensome for you.  You can still legally do any kind of<br/>&gt;changing and rearranging you want.</p><p>Well... if what we&apos;re disagreeing about is what the name of the work<br/>should be after I&apos;ve tinkered with it, that&apos;s a trivial matter to<br/>correct.  But that isn&apos;t your real bone of contention, is it?</p><p>&gt;Since it&apos;s my line of work, the presentation of previously<br/>&gt;unperformable scores, I thought my opinion might be of some interest to<br/>&gt;you on this subject.</p><p>It is.</p><p>&gt;The integrity of my compositions are threatened by those that don&apos;t see<br/>&gt;the true designs which are often buried within a piece.   I say the<br/>&gt;above foremost as an interpreter, but with the approval of the composer<br/>&gt;inside.  The producer in me wouldn&apos;t have it any other way.</p><p>Gosh!  It&apos;s hard for me to believe that anything I&apos;ve done or can do has<br/>the power to &quot;threaten&quot; anything!  If it&apos;s trash, just leave it behind.</p><p>The approval of the original composer, or knowledge of certain<br/>disapproval, elusive after that person&apos;s death (with the possible<br/>exception of someone like Partch, and a few others who were very<br/>explicit), would be nice to obtain.  But how?</p><p>[Neil Haverstick, TD 430.4:]<br/>&gt;On some deep, fundamental Universal level, I really don&apos;t feel like my<br/>&gt;music is &quot;my&quot; music.</p><p>That&apos;s the way I feel about my music also.  Yes, I do have some, which<br/>I&apos;ve shared only with individuals, not the list as a whole, mostly<br/>because it&apos;s tied to my non-GM synth in an intimate way.  I think I<br/>would be glad to have someone tackle rearranging my own works, though I<br/>might certainly dislike a particular attempt!  Of course, I realize that<br/>just because *I* feel this way does not mean that others do, or should!</p><p>I apologize, again, to everyone who believes my work misguided, ugly,<br/>inappropriate, ill-considered, offensive, or any other negative word<br/>I&apos;ve left out.  I will say, again, that I realize I&apos;ve not considered<br/>everything that could or should go into the ideal tunings of a work.<br/>It is my hope, as I continue to try to refine my methods, to have a<br/>group of people with whom to share.  Perhaps I&apos;ve picked the wrong<br/>group?</p><p>JdL</p></div>
