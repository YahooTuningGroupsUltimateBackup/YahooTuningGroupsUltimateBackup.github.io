Bergs Violin Concerto for instance is on the<br/>&gt;edge of, if not tonal then tuneable, musics. Weberns<br/>&gt;composition space spends a lot of time in and around diminished<br/>&gt;chord harmonys and melodies. It may be interesting to see<br/>&gt;whether casting it into a 5:6:7:9 system, or 1/7:1/6:1/5:1/4<br/>&gt;makes the &apos;concords and discords&apos; jump out more.</p><p>These are half-diminished seventh chords.</p><p>&gt;[and did I understand that from a harmonic entropy, these<br/>&gt;get the same rating?]</p><p>Not either dyadically or considered as a whole chord.</p></div>
