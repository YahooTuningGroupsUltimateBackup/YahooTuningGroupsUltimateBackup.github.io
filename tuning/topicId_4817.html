I hope<br/>that it may be of interest here also.]</p><p>An open letter is a curious format for Usenet, but somehow a &quot;harmonic<br/>letter&quot; (was that Banchieri&apos;s term?) seems a more natural form of<br/>expression than some pretence of a treatise with arcane terminology<br/>announcing a Grand Unified Theory of music. Maybe the restraining<br/>factor is that at least I know that my theoretical perspective is<br/>peculiar enough that it&apos;s very unlikely to be confused with a globally<br/>valid, let alone imperative, theory of any kind &lt;grin&gt;.</p><p>----------------------------------------<br/>1. Reflections on a virtual archicembalo<br/>----------------------------------------</p><p>Anyway, this is written about 24 hours after my first session at a<br/>24-note archicembalo in more or less the style of Nicola Vicentino --<br/>actually two keyboards in 1/4-comma meantone with those pure and<br/>delicious thirds, both with the usual Eb-G# arrangement -- but the<br/>upper one tuned a fifth of a tone higher! It&apos;s all the beauties of<br/>what I&apos;d call &quot;conventional modern music&quot; -- meaning the 16th century<br/>-- plus fifthtones, minimal thirds and &quot;proximate minor&quot; thirds (which<br/>Don Nicola describes), chromatic and &quot;enharmonic&quot; (microtonal)<br/>progressions, and so on. By the way, a fair caution before I end this<br/>paragraph: it&apos;s a digital setup, with a synthesizer and two keyboards,<br/>rather than some reconstruction of a 16th-century design.</p><p>It&apos;s so exciting in part, maybe, because conventional 16th-century<br/>music is like a &quot;natural language&quot; for me, the &quot;modern&quot; side of what I<br/>usually play or improvise. It&apos;s really awesome to sit at a keyboard<br/>with Vicentino&apos;s fifthtones (24 out of a potential 31 not quite<br/>equally tempered steps), and with a sense of being &quot;at home&quot; with<br/>Vicentino&apos;s everyday theory and musical approach -- making the journey<br/>beyond 12 or even 19 notes per octave and inside the semitone even<br/>more adventurous.</p><p>To me, anything outside Eb-G# is a &quot;special accidental,&quot; and maybe<br/>this makes Vicentino&apos;s new world of music all the more breathtaking.<br/>To describe how I conceive of modes, consonances, cadences, and<br/>patterns is a difficult task, one sometimes attempted here with a<br/>realization of the imperfect nature of words to describe music -- but I<br/>suspect that it is rather different than the way many people orient<br/>themselves to keys, chords, modulations, and &quot;harmonic structure.&quot; Is<br/>it possible that Vicentino might actually be a greater adventure for<br/>someone unacquainted with 16th-century style, when the everyday<br/>assumptions of the music as well as the &quot;avant garde&quot; part might be a<br/>new revelation?</p><p>Anyway, while we both seem to find some humor in the way that physics<br/>analogies get (mis)applied to just about any discipline or argument, I<br/>sense a real kinship between the sense of awe one can get from both<br/>physics and music. The feeling of sitting at an archicembalo realizing<br/>an open universe of 16th-century microtonalism -- however virtual the<br/>instrument, however reasonable the facsimile -- reminds me of how I<br/>felt reading a 17th-century text (translated from the French by Aphra<br/>Behn, famed as possibly the first English woman to be recognized as a<br/>professional writer) telling how inhabitants of another solar system<br/>would see our Sun as a star in some constellation like the Bear in our<br/>own evening sky. There are also passages in Nicolas of Cusa which have<br/>this effect on me -- a 15th-century Bishop and theologian who<br/>discussed an unbound universe, heliocentrism, and extraterrestrial<br/>inhabitants.</p><p>------------------------------------------------------------<br/>2. Enharmonic connotations: fifthtones, or musical homonyms?<br/>------------------------------------------------------------</p><p>Anyway, getting back for a moment to the geometric/musical dialogue<br/>that has been going on, I thought I might add a few odd comments.</p><p>First, to me, the term &quot;enharmonic&quot; has a rather specific meaning --<br/>or two not unconnected meanings. In an ancient (i.e. Greek/Roman)<br/>context, it means a genus which divides the tetrachord (four steps and<br/>three intervals making up a fourth) into two dieses of about half a<br/>semitone each, plus a major third or ditone. In a &quot;modern&quot;<br/>(i.e. Renaissance) context, it means a style of music using intervals<br/>of a rather similar size, typically the diesis of around a fifth of a<br/>tone. This is equal to the difference in tertian just intonation or<br/>meantone between G# and Ab, for example -- in 1/4-comma meantone, as<br/>in JI, 128:125, or about 41 cents.</p><p>Thus to me, as to Vicentino, &quot;enharmonic&quot; means more or less<br/>&quot;involving intervals or motions of around a fifth of a tone&quot; just as<br/>&quot;chromatic&quot; means &quot;involving (in tertian JI or meantone) the chromatic<br/>or minor semitone&quot; (e.g. G-G#).</p><p>The enharmonic diesis (e.g. G#-Ab, with the flat _higher_ in meantone)<br/>is itself measured in effect by an interesting parameter -- the<br/>craving for pure or near-pure major thirds in the 16th century. If a<br/>pure 5:4 major third is made the measure of the system, with all<br/>regular fifths the same, then G# and Ab will be about 41.06 cents<br/>apart, or more exactly 128:125, the difference between three pure<br/>major thirds and a pure 2:1 octave.</p><p>(To describe two different note spellings for the same tone, I might<br/>use the term &quot;homonym&quot; -- thus &quot;G#/Ab are homonyms in 12-tet&quot; (12-tone<br/>equal temperament) or &quot;Fbb and D## are homonyms in 31-tet, and<br/>_almost_ so in pure 1/4-comma meantone.&quot; It&apos;s curious how the same<br/>term, &quot;enharmonic,&quot; can carry the association either that two notes<br/>such as G#-Ab differ very tangibly by a diesis or fifthtone, or that<br/>they are realized by a single tone -- either connotation being<br/>empirically verifiable if one selects the right keyboard tuning.)</p><p>What Vicentino does is to take this simple fact and make it a virtue,<br/>indeed a radically new form of musical expression. His keyboard scheme<br/>features ranks tuned a diesis apart -- or a &quot;fifthtone,&quot; as I call it<br/>in a friendly manner in English. Using an asterisk (*) to show a note<br/>raised by such a fifthtone -- he uses a dot above the note, an ideal<br/>convention but more difficult in ASCII -- I would diagram the basic<br/>five ranks of his instrument as follows, with a dotted line showing<br/>the division between his first and second manuals (with split keys,<br/>and an extra sixth rank for some pure fifths to supplement the 31<br/>notes shown here):</p><p>         Db*        Eb*              Gb*       Ab*       Bb*         5<br/>  C*         D*         E*    F*        G*         A*       B*       4<br/>...................................................................<br/>      Db        D#         E#      Gb        Ab      A#        B#    3<br/>    C#            Eb             F#        G#          Bb            2<br/>C          D           E     F         G          A         B     C  1</p><p>My 24-note subset uses two regular keyboards in 1/4-comma meantone<br/>like this, with the second simply tuned a diesis or fifthtone higher:</p><p>      Db            Eb*            Gb        Ab          Bb*<br/>  C*          D*         E*   F*        G*         A*         B*   C*<br/>...................................................................<br/>    C#            Eb             F#        G#          Bb<br/>C          D           E     F         G          A         B     C</p><p>The white keys of my two 12-note keyboards are identical to<br/>Vicentino&apos;s first and fourth ranks, and the black of the first manual<br/>to his second rank, with the black keys of the second manual including<br/>the extra flats of his third rank (Db, Gb, Ab) plus two enharmonic<br/>accidentals of his fifth rank (Eb*, Bb*).</p><p>Happily, these 24 notes are sufficient to play the two complete<br/>enharmonic or fifthtone pieces I know from the 16th century -- with<br/>one modification for Vicentino&apos;s _Musica prisca caput_, changing the<br/>Eb* to a rather less exotic but still somewhat unusual D#. Anthoine de<br/>Bertrand&apos;s _Ie suis tellement amoureux_ (1578) uses Eb*, but not D#.</p><p>------------------------------<br/>3. Not-quite-equal temperament<br/>------------------------------</p><p>While Vicentino&apos;s full set of an octave divided into 31 notes a<br/>fifthtone apart is often equated with 31-tet -- I&apos;ve done it myself --<br/>I&apos;m tempted to put my proverbial Foote down (are you reading this,<br/>Ed?) and point out that 1/4-comma meantone (pure major thirds) would<br/>seem easier to tune using 16th-century methods than a precise division<br/>of the octave into 31 equal steps.</p><p>In fact, Vicentino himself tells us that one should start out by<br/>tempering the first two ranks in the usual manner &quot;as the good tuners<br/>do it, with the fifths somewhat blunted,&quot; and 1/4-comma meantone would<br/>produce an _almost_ equal 31-note division.</p><p>This is basically how I went about it digitally, starting with a<br/>default 1/4-comma meantone (Eb-G#), and then editing the synthesizer&apos;s<br/>tuning table for the second manual by raising each of the 12 notes by<br/>the diesis or fifthtone of 128:125 or around 41 cents (expressed<br/>almost exactly in digital terms as 35 tuning units of 1/1024 octave).</p><p>Either with Vicentino&apos;s original two-manual scheme, or with this<br/>24-note variant, maybe the most striking feature is that one can move<br/>from a note on the first manual to its counterpart on the second --<br/>thus making a direct jump of a fifthtone, e.g. C-C*. This can be done<br/>not only with individual notes, but with full four-voice sonorities,<br/>as Vicentino does (I use MIDI-style notation, with C4 as middle C and<br/>higher numbers showing higher octaves):</p><p>E4 E*4<br/>G3 C*4<br/>C4 G*3<br/>C3 C*3</p><p>On a keyboard, the voice-crossing is a feature that gets &quot;neutralized&quot;<br/>(to borrow a linguistic term) -- one simply leaps from C3-G3-C4-E4 on<br/>the lower manual (Vicentino&apos;s first rank) to C*3-G*3-C*4-E*4, the same<br/>notes on the upper manual (Vicentino&apos;s fourth rank).</p><p>Might one call this a &quot;quantum leap&quot;? Completing a familiar<br/>16th-century progression of consonances or cadence -- but with the<br/>shift of a diesis -- is another technique that both Vicentino and<br/>Bertrand use (here the latter):</p><p>   *<br/>C5 D5<br/>E4 F4*<br/>G3 Bb*3<br/>C3 Bb*2</p><p>Here my * above the highest voice suggests an editorial accidental --<br/>although leaving the D unaltered would produce Vicentino&apos;s &quot;proximate<br/>minor third&quot; (intermediate between minor and major) which he notes has<br/>a ratio of around 11:9, and finds to be rather concordant. As always<br/>with Renaissance accidentals, decisions, decisions. Maybe such<br/>progressions are like meeting an old and welcome friend -- in some<br/>kind of intriguingly warped interstellar space.</p><p>                      *         *        *</p><p>This leads me to a few observations on the art of metaphor in music,<br/>especially physics and geometry metaphors and the like.</p><p>------------------------------------------------------<br/>4. Geomorphic tuning?: Time zones and paired antipodes<br/>------------------------------------------------------</p><p>One metaphor that occurred to me for my 24-note version of Vicentino&apos;s<br/>tuning was a &quot;geomorphic&quot; music, the idea being that just as the Earth<br/>is not a perfect sphere, but slightly oblate or pear-shaped, so<br/>1/4-comma meantone in 31 notes is _not quite_ circular.</p><p>We actually get two slightly different flavors of fifthtones, with [a<br/>whole-tone consisting of] three usual dieses of 128:125 or 41.06 cents<br/>plus two smaller fifthtones of around 34.99 cents, the difference between<br/>a regular diesis and a minor semitone in 1/4-comma meantone of about 76.04<br/>cents. I like this -- maybe it&apos;s a bit like flavors of quarks or<br/>something, and more interesting than just five identical steps.  I&apos;m<br/>tempted to call them major and minor fifthtones.</p><p>While Vicentino&apos;s full 31-note system is _almost_ circular, a 24-note<br/>subset isn&apos;t, of course. Then, again, the idea of circumnavigating the<br/>whole system is something I hear about rather than do, being<br/>accustomed to open-ended modal systems and tunings based on<br/>Pythagorean or meantone where the usual range of accidentals is Eb-G#;<br/>actual 16th-century enharmonic (fifthtone) pieces that I&apos;m aware of<br/>stay within a 24-note range rather than attempting such closed<br/>circularity in practice.</p><p>As a metaphor, I&apos;m tempted maybe to compare a &quot;24 out of 31-quasi-tet&quot;<br/>instrument to a planet where you can only see one side at a time --<br/>considerably more than half (with the Moon, I seem to recall that<br/>about 58% is visible from Earth).</p><p>Then the planetary metaphor suggested to me 24 &quot;time zones&quot; --<br/>although this suggests a closed tuning, not even approximated in 24<br/>notes. (For the curious, the ends of the chain at Fbb or Eb* and G#<br/>form what I might call in Vicentino&apos;s terms the &quot;proximate major<br/>third,&quot; equal to a pure major third plus a fifthtone, here the smaller<br/>one of 35 cents, or about 421 cents in all.)</p><p>A striking feature is that making an enharmonic shift of a fifthtone<br/>like C-C* involves leaping 12 of our 24 time zones, if we arrange them<br/>in a tuning chain of fifths. (We could also write C* as Dbb -- part of<br/>a discussion on the &quot;spatial metric&quot; of 1/4-comma meantone which I&apos;ll<br/>save for another post. Note that moving 12 fifths in the flat<br/>direction of the tuning chain takes us _up_ a diesis.)</p><p>Is this like a sudden shift of &quot;night and day,&quot; or like antipodes --<br/>an attractive metaphor, given the way in which these keys are paired<br/>with their counterparts in Vicentino&apos;s first and fourth ranks, for<br/>example, or more generally throughout my lower and upper manuals (if<br/>we write Gb as F#*, for example, this generalized feature of my<br/>24-note arrangement may become clearer).</p><p>Taking a medieval or Renaissance perspective, incidentally, I consider<br/>circles, chains, spheres, or other metaphors for fifths to be of<br/>interest especially for tuning, but hardly as the main model for<br/>vertical progressions or overall organization. True, Renaissance<br/>cadences often involve the motion of the bass by a fifth or fourth,<br/>etc. -- but this is just one of many ways to connect sonorities or to<br/>relate a pattern of centers or progressions in the course of a<br/>piece. Bass motion by a second or third seems to me equally<br/>significant, and beautifully fluid. Often I tend to look to<br/>progressions of consonances by stepwise contrary motion in describing<br/>a vertical event or gesture, and the kinship of sonorities connected<br/>by the bass motion of a third is a common feature of Renaissance style<br/>exploited by various composers, both in its gentle shadings and its<br/>ear-catching chromatic versions.</p><p>(My friend Peter van Marissing, an esteemed music teacher, organist,<br/>and scholar of historical tunings, suggests that the pure or near-pure<br/>thirds of meantone may foster such thirdwise kinship in Renaissance<br/>music, a topic for some interesting discussions.)</p><p>Anyway, the various dialogues in progress here may suggest that just<br/>as music can have many styles and tunings, so it can have many<br/>&quot;roadmaps&quot; and metaphors.</p><p>Most appreciatively,</p><p>Margo Schulter<br/><a href="mailto:mschulter@value.net">mschulter@value.net</a></p></div>
