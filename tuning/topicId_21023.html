Unless that sound is gated, of course.</p><p>I don&apos;t think &quot;power spectrum&quot; can be explained in layman&apos;s terms.  It<br/>isn&apos;t something laymen usually worry about.  It&apos;s a way of representing a<br/>sound showing power as a function of frequency rather than time.  You<br/>generate it from the time-signal using a Fourier transform, which is<br/>similar to the Fourier series for strengths of overtones but for<br/>continuous frequencies.  You use power rather than amplitude so that you<br/>only get positive numbers.</p><p>Or something like that.  It&apos;s actually an &quot;auto correlation&quot; that gets<br/>plotted.</p><p>I don&apos;t know what &quot;spectral density&quot; is.</p><p>&gt; It&apos;s just that I have heard that white noise is 1/f^0, and brown noise<br/>&gt; is<br/>&gt; 1/f^2</p><p>This is correct.  It means that in white noise, all frequencies are as<br/>strong.  This is by analogy to white light.  It doesn&apos;t mean the power<br/>spectrum is a straight line, as is sometimes stated, because noise has to<br/>be random.  But the power doesn&apos;t depend on frequency.  1/f^0 is merely a<br/>clever way of saying &quot;nothing to do with frequency.</p><p>This &quot;brown noise&quot; is what you would get by plotting a random walk as<br/>amplitude against time, hence modelling Brownian motion.</p><p>1/f noise is also called &quot;pink noise&quot; because the lower frequencies are<br/>more prominent, like with pink light.</p><p>&gt;, and knowing me, and knowing that the n-bonaccis lye between<br/>&gt; 1--------&gt;2, I though a little sonic alchemy would be in order.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Get my drift?</p><p>There is a body of literature relating music to 1/f noise.  All music,<br/>with some exceptions (Stockhausen and Xenakis apparently, I don&apos;t have<br/>precise references) looks like 1/f noise if you send it through a spectrum<br/>analyser.  &quot;Chaos Under Control&quot; by Peak&amp;Frame is the book I got all this<br/>from.</p><p>I have C code for generating noise for a given frequency ratios.  It can<br/>be compiled for PCs, and outputs WAV files.  I could dig it out and send<br/>it to you (either source or executable) if you like.  It&apos;s not very big.<br/>I find the brown region is more pleasing on the ear.</p><p>                    Graham</p></div><h3>Paul H.
