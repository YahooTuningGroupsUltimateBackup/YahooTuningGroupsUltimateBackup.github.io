The important thing is to find music that moves<br/>YOU, regardless of the pronouncements of snobbish classical or jazz radio<br/>DJs.</p><p>&gt;The American canon consists of the Ellingtons, Parkers, Hollidays,<br/>&gt;Hendrixs...etc.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;The attempts at carrying on the European &quot;classical canon&quot;, mostly found in<br/>&gt;academic settings in America and Europe, are largely failures because they<br/>&gt;are too self-consciously &gt;trying&lt; to gain admittance for themselves to the<br/>&gt;&quot;Canon&quot;. Thus they lose their authenticity in nostalgia and become overly<br/>&gt;abstract. This is proved by the fact that, for the most part, nobody gives a<br/>&gt;shit about it except the few participants.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;Calling &quot;dots on paper&quot; a tyranny, or something similar, is perhaps<br/>&gt;hyperbolic, and any limitations posed by it are only in the minds of those<br/>&gt;who chose to be limited. The dots are a tool, nothing more, useful for<br/>&gt;notating certain aspects of some kinds of music.</p><p>To say that composers lose some sort of &quot;authenticity&quot; (which from your<br/>self-apotheosized &quot;American canon&quot; means distinctive folk roots or other<br/>sort of nationalism) by writing for concert audiences with traditional<br/>classical media is just the sort of &quot;limitation&quot; that exists in the minds<br/>of those who choose to be limited. Why is an abstract piece by a dead<br/>European more &quot;authentic&quot; that that of an American?</p><p>You may not give a shit about contemporary classical composers (I<br/>personally don&apos;t care much for a lot of contemporary jazz), but that<br/>doesn&apos;t change the fact that their music is for many people (more than the<br/>&quot;few participants&quot;) a powerful and wonderful experience. I have known a lot<br/>of contemporary &quot;art music&quot; composers, both in and out of academia, and I<br/>have never met one that I thought was composing to be in some sort of<br/>war-horse gallery.</p><p>Though the establishment of The Canon is a rallying cry for postmodernists<br/>these days, I&apos;m not here to argue that it should be wiped out by some kind<br/>of equalizing relativism, but by the spirit of celebrating individual<br/>taste. I know it can be argued that having some kind of short list of<br/>&quot;great&quot; pieces can help guide the novice. However, establishment of the<br/>canon has also meant that classical music has accumulated some undeserved<br/>and misleading associations and that the 1812 Overture is recorded and<br/>performed with mind-numbing frequency while (in my opinion) equally or more<br/>deserving works go unheard. On balance, I would happily blow up the Canon.</p><p>&gt;As far as it being eurocentic and male dominated, there is a funny/sad quote<br/>&gt;(maybe Anthony Burgess?): &quot;When the Zulus have a Tolstoy, I will read him.&quot;</p><p>How does he or you know that the Zulus don&apos;t have a Tolstoy? Aside from the<br/>ignorance about the different types and roles of art among the Europeans<br/>and traditional Africans that this quote belies, I would only take it<br/>seriously if it came from someone familiar enough with Zulu literature to<br/>categorically state that this is not the case.</p><p>However, I can state that I prefer Zulu traditional music to Tolstoy any<br/>day of the week and find much of it just as artistically sophisticated.</p><p>Bill</p><p>^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^<br/>^ Bill Alves                                      email: <a href="mailto:alves@hmc.edu">alves@hmc.edu</a> ^<br/>^ Harvey Mudd College                 URL: <a href="http://www2.hmc.edu/~alves/">http://www2.hmc.edu/~alves/</a> ^<br/>^ 301 E.

Real people, most people, &quot;the masses&quot; out there, are only<br/>experimental to a very small degree.  They rely almost exclusively on<br/>recommendations and peer pressure of one type or another to form their tastes<br/>and influence their buying/listening decisions -- ultimately resulting in<br/>what Bill called the &quot;masterpiece syndrome&quot;.  I.e., people mostly listen to<br/>what other people they like or respect or trust tell them is cool or good or<br/>chic.  Few people go far enough in exploratory mode to ignore the DJs,<br/>friends, newspapers, TV, etc, to find out what they really might like out of<br/>all available music.  Same applies to art and literature, and even food...<br/>most people just don&apos;t wander out into the jungle and start eating all plants<br/>&amp; animals randomly to find out what tastes good.</p><p>&gt; classical music has accumulated some undeserved<br/>&gt; and misleading associations and that the 1812 Overture is recorded and<br/>&gt; performed with mind-numbing frequency while (in my opinion) equally or more<br/>&gt; deserving works go unheard.</p><p>That&apos;s an effect.  One could probably say that most things which wind up<br/>being vastly popular have some redeeming characteristic.  Not all of them<br/>have enough redeeming enough characteristics to render them perennially<br/>popular.  It also seems to be the case, at least in America, that popularity<br/>begets more popularity -- and that is always detrimental to things which<br/>maybe be equally good or better, but just don&apos;t have a &quot;90 percent market<br/>share&quot;.</p><p>A good question for microtonalists, in particular, who might want to have<br/>their stuff listened to, would be &quot;How can we counteract the public tendency<br/>toward conservative listening?&quot;</p><p>&#x9;Rick</p></div><h3>Zhang2323@xxx.xxx</h3><span>10/13/1999 7:01:13 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>In a message dated 10/13/99 10:08:01 PM, you wrote:</p><p><a href="mailto:rmcgowan@apple.com">rmcgowan@apple.com</a> wrote:<br/>&lt;&lt;in America, that popularity<br/>begets more popularity -- and that is always detrimental to things which<br/>maybe be equally good or better, but just don&apos;t have a &quot;90 percent market<br/>share&quot;.&gt;&gt;</p><p>yep,... &quot;The Free Market does not make for Free Minds.

If you cant tell good music from bad or mearly pleasant, then<br/>how do you go about composing? Of course individual tastes vary, but lets<br/>not take this to the extreme of solipcism. Composers like Bach and Beethoven<br/>are put on pedestals for a reason and cranks like Partch (who as a composer<br/>is not worthy to undo Bach&apos;s sandlestrap) only show their own crankishness<br/>by trying to pull them down. (I admire Partch for alot of reasons, but his<br/>music criticisim is not one of them.)</p><p>The &gt;european&lt; &gt;classical&lt; canon only defines  &gt;european&lt; &gt;classical&lt; music.<br/>Nobody said it should limit appreciation of other kinds of music.</p><p>&gt;<br/>&gt;A canon supposedly arrived at by some mythical consensus of listeners<br/>&gt;serves only to narrow tastes, and if that is the case with Chinese<br/>&gt;painting, I would fault it the same way.

What characterizes the best of the &quot;american canon&quot; is originality and<br/>power. What characterizes most academic composing is overintellecualized<br/>abstraction and ennervation. Not all, but alot that I&apos;ve heard.</p><p>&gt;<br/>&gt;You may not give a shit about contemporary classical composers (I<br/>&gt;personally don&apos;t care much for a lot of contemporary jazz), but that<br/>&gt;doesn&apos;t change the fact that their music is for many people (more than the<br/>&gt;&quot;few participants&quot;) a powerful and wonderful experience.</p><p>ok. so maybe &quot;many&quot; is 5-10. The jazz canon seems to be closed, at least for<br/>now. Contemporary jazz is mostly rehashing.</p><p>.

Burgess (or whoever the quote is from) wants a novel<br/>printed on paper. Now, I believe this quote was delivered in the context of<br/>the multicult movement when minority studies departments were calling for<br/>the expulsion of great works by dead white males in favor of less than great<br/>works by other catagories of writers. If you want to play the game-<br/>submitting &gt;your&lt; novel printed on paper for admission to the canon - then<br/>it better stack up against Dostoievsky (I never liked Tolstoy as much,<br/>although Anna Karenina was great). Otherwise its a joke. You can&apos;t throw out<br/>something that anybody with a modicum of discernment can tell is a great<br/>creation of the human spirit simply out of resentment that your particular<br/>ethnic group has not yet produced anything on this level &gt;in this genre&lt;.<br/>Imagine a white person wanting to throw out Parker and Coltrane and just<br/>listen to Stan Getz simply because he&apos;s white. Seems pretty dumb when the<br/>shoe is put on the other (not politically correct) foot.</p><p>So, if yer gonna write music with dots for classical instruments and<br/>ensembles to be performed in concert halls, maybe on the same program with a<br/>work by Beethoven, then you are trying to fit in, to play a certain game.<br/>All I&apos;m saying is that if you&apos;re trying to play that game then you&apos;ve<br/>already lost some authenticity cause you&apos;re playing by somebody else&apos;s<br/>rules. To write a &quot;symphony&quot; today, and take Beethoven or Sibelius as your<br/>model, and want to have it performed by the Philharmonic Society of<br/>Boredomthroughstagnationsville, is to be a wannabe - a wannabe &quot;classical&quot;<br/>composer. History will have no qualms about assigning this kind of stuff to<br/>the dustbin.</p><p>&gt;<br/>&gt;However, I can state that I prefer Zulu traditional music to Tolstoy any<br/>&gt;day of the week and find much of it just as artistically sophisticated.</p><p>Thats the other neat possibility - the Zulu&apos;s &quot;Tolstoy&quot; is a musician, not a<br/>wordsmith at all! I&apos;d rather listen to Zulu traditional music than Brian<br/>Fernyhough or Milt Babbitt any day of the week.</p><p>dante</p></div><h3>William S.

But...  First off,<br/>when did Partch ever try to tear down Bach or Beethovan?  He called them<br/>daring.  He was a classically-trained performer, and according to Gilmore<br/>had strong feelings about how Chopin, for one, should be played.</p><p>Second, and most importantly, it is my considered opinion that Partch is to<br/>be listed with Bach and Beethovan among the greatest, say 30, composers in<br/>history.  This would probably still be the case if his music were<br/>transcribed for the piano.  Have you listened to his music?</p><p>&gt;And what &quot;equally or more deserving works&quot; from Tchaikovsky&apos;s time are there<br/>&gt;not enough recordings of?</p><p>Not many that I know of.  There is Nielsen, who was the next generation,<br/>but whose career intersected T&apos;s for five years.</p><p>The point stands that there are many works more deserving than, say, the<br/>1812, in other periods and even in T&apos;s own output, that have been recorded<br/>far less.  Beethovan had trouble getting past Moonlight, much to his<br/>chagrin.  How many times have you heard Sonata 28, which fits in the &quot;no<br/>better organization of sound known to man&quot; department?</p><p>Tuesday night I saw the Philadelphia orchestra.  They&apos;re doing a season of<br/>entirely 20th century works.  A great idea.  What did they play?  The<br/>Planets and Honegger 3.  The Planets is fantastic, and they nailed it, but<br/>have you ever heard anything else by Holst in concert?  They deserve credit<br/>for playing Honegger, but they picked his most famous symphony, and<br/>butchered it.</p><p>I can hardly get recordings of Honegger&apos;s other symphonies.

But...  First off,<br/>&gt;when did Partch ever try to tear down Bach or Beethovan?  He called them<br/>&gt;daring.  He was a classically-trained performer, and according to Gilmore<br/>&gt;had strong feelings about how Chopin, for one, should be played.</p><p>Hey Carl-</p><p>Unless I&apos;m hallucinating, I remember seeing in &quot;Bitter Harvest&quot; writing<br/>about Bach that was negative.</p><p>&gt;<br/>&gt;Second, and most importantly, it is my considered opinion that Partch is to<br/>&gt;be listed with Bach and Beethovan among the greatest, say 30, composers in<br/>&gt;history.  This would probably still be the case if his music were<br/>&gt;transcribed for the piano.  Have you listened to his music?</p><p>I dunno, Carl- I admire the guys originality and vision, his inventiveness<br/>and industry, but the actual music? I played Guitar One in two performances<br/>of Revelation at the Courthouse Park, and of course have heard other stuff.<br/>Let&apos;s take one of his most frequently performed works- US Highball. Do you<br/>really consider this &quot;great music&quot; on the same creative level as (forget<br/>Bach and Beethoven) the best of Lou Harrison, Stravinsky, Shostokovitch etc?<br/>I must be missing something. I&apos;d say the work is &quot;cute&quot; but thats about all.<br/>In general I find his vocal writing banal and even irritating. And whats<br/>more (I&apos;m sure Ill have no more friends on this list after this, but I have<br/>to be honest!) I don&apos;t think he really had any sensitivity to the subtleties<br/>of the intervals he was using, especially vertically. Too much of it sounds<br/>random and jangly. Maybe you could recomend what you consider his best piece<br/>and I could check it out (if I haven&apos;t heard it).</p><p>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt;And what &quot;equally or more deserving works&quot; from Tchaikovsky&apos;s time are<br/>there<br/>&gt;&gt;not enough recordings of?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;Not many that I know of.  There is Nielsen, who was the next generation,<br/>&gt;but whose career intersected T&apos;s for five years.</p><p>I think there&apos;s plenty of recordings of Nielsen available. And lets face it,<br/>T might lack depth sometimes but his melodic invention is second to none.<br/>Nielsen is not on the same level.</p><p>&gt;<br/>&gt;The point stands that there are many works more deserving than, say, the<br/>&gt;1812, in other periods and even in T&apos;s own output, that have been recorded<br/>&gt;far less.  Beethovan had trouble getting past Moonlight, much to his<br/>&gt;chagrin.  How many times have you heard Sonata 28, which fits in the &quot;no<br/>&gt;better organization of sound known to man&quot; department?</p><p>I think you can walk into any record store and find dozens of recordings of<br/>all the Beethoven Sonatas.

Maybe its something like this that I was trying to get<br/>at.</p><p>Sibelius?

If you look at the<br/>repertories of orchestras, especially relatively small orchestras, you will<br/>see the same pieces over and over again and the representation of certain<br/>time periods out of all reasonable proportion. Does the fact that Beethoven<br/>was the best composer of his period mean that we should never (or rarely)<br/>have a chance to hear Carlos Chavez&apos;s wonderful symphonies or the<br/>orchestral works of Ben Johnston or a concerto of Benedetto Marcello?</p><p>&gt;Why do you have a problem with discerning and appreciating what is best in<br/>&gt;an art form? If you cant tell good music from bad or mearly pleasant, then<br/>&gt;how do you go about composing?</p><p>The only &quot;problem&quot; I have is with people presenting me with a judgement of<br/>what good or authentic music is as objective fact, or with someone implying<br/>that my openness to differences of opinion results from a &quot;problem&quot; with<br/>discernment or appreciation. As I said, I have no intention of using<br/>relativism as the Great Equalizer.</p><p>In my job as a teacher, I get students all the time who picture classical<br/>music as an endless stream of sonomulent Mozart divertimenti to accompany<br/>cocktails. It is one of my great delights to turn them on to Antheil or<br/>Dresher or Reich or Perotin or whomever. Rewardingly often their reaction<br/>is &quot;Wow! This is *cool*. Why didn&apos;t I know that classical music could be<br/>like this?&quot;</p><p>Part of the answer, of course, lies in the sad state of arts education in<br/>this country, and part of it lies in the ever-encroaching hegemony of<br/>market-driven culture in our society. But I believe a lot of it lies in the<br/>self-feeding myth of a pantheon of culture that was erected by a few<br/>critics and the impression that trickles down to these students that<br/>classical music is an esoteric practice presided over by high priests who<br/>use terms like &quot;tonic recapitulation&quot; in a vaguely foreign accent.</p><p>I have had students who, after having taken a music intro course, couldn&apos;t<br/>stand Verdi but liked Babbitt. I have had students who found Bach too busy<br/>but loved Copland. I have had students that shook their heads at<br/>Stockhausen but luxuriated in Debussy. To them all I have to explain that,<br/>while they can probably find a recording of every scrap of hackwork that<br/>Beethoven ever produced and can hear 15 performances of him within driving<br/>distance this month, if they want to go much further in an interest in,<br/>say, microtonal music, their options are rather limited.</p><p>&gt;The &gt;european&lt; &gt;classical&lt; canon only defines  &gt;european&lt; &gt;classical&lt; music.<br/>&gt;Nobody said it should limit appreciation of other kinds of music.</p><p>So it should only limit appreciation of European music? The fact is that<br/>record companies limit all of our choices every time they record yet<br/>another performance of the Four Seasons.</p><p>&gt;nope. What characterizes the best of the &quot;american canon&quot; is originality and<br/>&gt;power.</p><p>Leaving aside for the moment the questionable hypothesis that originality<br/>necessarily makes good music and vice-versa, my &quot;American Canon&quot; is<br/>apparently very different from yours.</p><p>&gt;And what &quot;equally or more deserving works&quot; from Tchaikovsky&apos;s time are there<br/>&gt;not enough recordings of?</p><p>Why do you think that the rather questionable exaltation of the 1812<br/>Overture only limits our access to music from Tchaikovsky&apos;s contemporaries?</p><p>&gt;So, if yer gonna write music with dots for classical instruments and<br/>&gt;ensembles to be performed in concert halls, maybe on the same program with a<br/>&gt;work by Beethoven, then you are trying to fit in, to play a certain game.<br/>&gt;All I&apos;m saying is that if you&apos;re trying to play that game then you&apos;ve<br/>&gt;already lost some authenticity cause you&apos;re playing by somebody else&apos;s<br/>&gt;rules. To write a &quot;symphony&quot; today, and take Beethoven or Sibelius as your<br/>&gt;model, and want to have it performed by the Philharmonic Society of<br/>&gt;Boredomthroughstagnationsville, is to be a wannabe - a wannabe &quot;classical&quot;<br/>&gt;composer. History will have no qualms about assigning this kind of stuff to<br/>&gt;the dustbin.</p><p>As you later seem to have retracted this paragraph, I will refrain from<br/>airing a vigorous dissent. However, I will offer the following story:</p><p>I was at a lecture by a pianist at a music school one time and this<br/>particular lecturer encouraged the student performers to seek out and<br/>perform music by their student composer colleagues. During the question<br/>period, one student asked, &quot;But how do I know that their work will be a<br/>masterpiece?&quot;</p><p>The lecturer asked the student what instrument he played. The answer was<br/>violin. &quot;Well,&quot; came the reply, &quot;that composer doesn&apos;t know that you&apos;re<br/>going to be Jascha Heifetz either.&quot;</p><p>The more germane point to this discussion is that this student had been<br/>brainwashed into believing 1) that only &quot;masterpieces&quot; were worth his time,<br/>and 2) that he was powerless to judge what might make a new piece a<br/>&quot;masterpiece&quot; -- that such a honorific could only be handed down by a<br/>hundred years of cultural consensus. (It&apos;s a good thing that few of<br/>Beethoven&apos;s contemporary performers took this point of view.)</p><p>Unfortunately, this attitude, in my experience, is hardly uncommon, and it<br/>is a direct result of our culture&apos;s regrettable preoccupation with the idea<br/>that musical quality (at least for classical music) is an attribute that is<br/>elected, not felt.</p><p>Bill</p><p>^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^<br/>^ Bill Alves                                      email: <a href="mailto:alves@hmc.edu">alves@hmc.edu</a> ^<br/>^ Harvey Mudd College                 URL: <a href="http://www2.hmc.edu/~alves/">http://www2.hmc.edu/~alves/</a> ^<br/>^ 301 E.

Is that part cool?<br/>Sound?  How do your ears feel?  Is the performance a vehicle or a barrier<br/>for the notes?  Concept?  What&apos;s the point?</p><p>Partch was a genius of all three of these.

The vast majority of fans of any given style are notorious for<br/>smirking at other styles.  Partch disciples especially.  This is an<br/>unfortunate symptom of lazy listening.  It is obvious that music goodness<br/>depends on the musical intelligence of the composer, not than the style<br/>he&apos;s working in.  Until recently the style he&apos;s working in was more or less<br/>determined by geography.
