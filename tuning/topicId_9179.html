I won&apos;t argue about that here; if you don&apos;t think it happens, then propriety and CS aren&apos;t for you.  But if you&apos;re interesting in getting it to happen or not, then they are for you.</p><p>Propriety and CS both measure how easy it is for the listener to un-ambiguously assign scale degree numbers to pitches as he hears them.  CS assumes that a listener can recognize intervals by their _specific_ size -- a 3:2 is distinct from a 7:5, and so on.  So CS asks, once you recognize the interval, will there be any doubt as to what scale degree it is?  If you can answer &quot;no&quot;, your scale is CS.  In the diatonic scale in 12-tet, you can answer no for all the intervals but the tritone -- it can be a fourth or a fifth; you need other notes to clarify its position in the scale.</p><p>Propriety does the same thing, except it assumes that listeners recognize intervals by their _relative_ size -- that the listener ranks the intervals he hears by how big they are.  The specific tuning of the intervals doesn&apos;t matter, so long as their ranks are preserved.  This means the theory can be tested to see if people percieve a similarity between different tunings of a scale with the same &quot;rank-order&quot;, and if they percieve a difference between two tunings of a scale with a different rank-order.  Rothenberg has actually suggested some very cool experiments to test many aspects of his theory, which are as yet un-tested (enthno-musicology is simply not a source of reliable scientific information here).</p><p>-Carl</p></div><h3>Gerald Eskelin &#x3C;stg3music@earthlink.net&#x3E;</h3><span>3/10/2000 11:20:46 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Carl Lumma said:</p><p>&gt; Rothenberg has<br/>&gt; actually suggested some very cool experiments to test many aspects of his<br/>&gt; theory, which are as yet un-tested (enthno-musicology is simply not a<br/>&gt; source of reliable scientific information here).</p><p>This sounds very interesting, Carl.
