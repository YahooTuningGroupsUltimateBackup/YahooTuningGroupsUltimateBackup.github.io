I hope you didn&apos;t mind that I<br/>more or less<br/>suspected a strict JI concept in your approach to Indian music. Indeed, as<br/>Paul also mentions in his post, involving a certain temperament may get us<br/>clooser to the acoustic reality of this fascinating music.</p><p>I printed out your message and need to do some study on it before getting<br/>back to the subject.<br/>&gt; I&apos;m not qualified to speak about music in general and again much less about<br/>&gt; Indian music.</p><p>Interesting. What *makes* peoples actually qualified? I think, if you can<br/>hear yourself what you&apos;re talking about, that&apos;s quite enough.</p><p> --Wim</p></div>
