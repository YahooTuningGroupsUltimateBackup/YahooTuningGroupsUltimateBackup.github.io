I won&apos;t try to color your listening with<br/>mine, so write in with your results and we can all share.</p><p>1. 13/12 - 4/3 - 5/3</p><p>Try this position and see what you think of its consonance.  Be sure to try<br/>it in different registers before you make up your mind.  Then try different<br/>inversions, and see which one you like best.  Lastly, try doubling each one<br/>of the notes in the bass, and see how they work.</p><p>2. 15/16 - 24/7 - 5/1</p><p>Howabout this?  Consonant?  What happens if you mistune the 15/16 a bit?  I<br/>tried 76/81, about 1.4 cents off.</p><p>I did them first with Graham Breed&apos;s Midi Relay and my Soundblaster Live<br/>with the GM reed organ patch.  Then I fired up Justonic&apos;s pitch palette<br/>with &quot;WAV sound&quot; and the &quot;triangle wave&quot; patch.  My results were the same<br/>with both instruments.</p><p>I will say that my conclusions supported my long-standing belief that<br/>octave-invariance is out the window when you go above the 7-limit.</p><p>Carl</p></div>
