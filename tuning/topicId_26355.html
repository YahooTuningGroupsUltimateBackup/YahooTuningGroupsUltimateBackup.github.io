I think that the<br/>edit occurs when the data byte is received and that the<br/>order of the parameter bytes is irrelevant, and in fact<br/>if only one is received (say the LSB) then the other<br/>from the last time is retained. But that&apos;s just a vague<br/>memory. The only instrument I am familiar with that<br/>uses them a lot is the Prophet VS.</p><p>I&apos;d say that when you are recieving them, you should be<br/>able to catch them in any order and you need to have a<br/>static history buffer of 32 bytes to hold the last MSB<br/>and LSB received on each of 16 channels per port. When<br/>you get the data byte, accept whatever the current<br/>state of your NRPN buffer is. (I suggest don&apos;t use the<br/>RPNs since they are supposed to be registered with MMA<br/>first.)</p><p>- Jeff</p></div>
