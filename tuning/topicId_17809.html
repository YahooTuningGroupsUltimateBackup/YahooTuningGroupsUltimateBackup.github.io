I thought it might be appropriate to post some<br/>impressions.</p><p>&gt;&gt;The CD is very professionally made, with a fat booklet (36 pages!) which<br/>explains the historical perspective to what Ed has done.  It&apos;s true,<br/>unfortunately, that no actual numbers for the tunings used are part of<br/>this booklet&lt;&lt;</p><p>    I hadn&apos;t thought that the Kirnberger or Young would need much<br/>explanation, but our next one has charts and pictures for the temperaments<br/>used.  It is hard to know just how much info can be digested, and things did<br/>run a little long on the historical explanation.</p><p>&gt;&gt;Included are: Sonata, Op. 13 (&quot;Pathetique&quot;), Op. 14 No. 1, Op. 27 No. 2<br/>(&quot;Moonlight&quot;), and Op. 53 (&quot;Waldstein&quot;).  All are ably played by Enid<br/>Katahn on a great sounding and competently recorded Steinway D grand<br/>piano (serial number 467858 - how&apos;s THAT for specific info?).&lt;&lt;</p><p> &gt;&gt; If Ed, and others who are working along similar lines, are having<br/>trouble (and I suspect they are) selling the idea of using tunings such<br/>as these in concerts around the globe, it may be because the effects are<br/>fairly subtle. &lt;&lt;</p><p>     There is resistance,yes.  However, it seems to come exclusively from<br/>those musicians that haven&apos;t played a well tempered piano.  That ET is such a<br/>poor representation of a tonal palette used by the classical masters is a<br/>rather alarming concept to musicians, musicologists, and &quot;educators&quot; who have<br/>&quot;positions&quot;.  To accept it is to admit that they have missed the boat on a<br/>big component of their art.  This is why I try to let the sounds do the heavy<br/>lifting before launching into the sales job.  It is easy to slam the doors by<br/>telling a pianist that they have been doing it all wrong for their whole<br/>life!<br/>     The jazz crowd, OTOH, has been digging into the WT sounds with a<br/>vigor,around here.<br/>    As far as the sublety, there are varied impressions. These range from &quot;I<br/>can&apos;t hear any difference&quot; to &quot;Wow, this makes for entirely new music&quot;.<br/>   One effect of the well tempering only shows itself after some familiarity,<br/>and that is the realization of what ET piano really sounds like.  A common<br/>response is that after several listenings to Beethoven on a well tempered<br/>piano,  hearing his music in ET is a drab, tedious experience.  Thus the<br/>warning label on the CD package.  I hope to bring this perspective shift into<br/>closer, more immediate focus on our next project by having the same short<br/>Mozart piece in three tunings, one after the other.  ET will be the last, and<br/>hopefully, will show itself to be as lacking in color as I hear it.  Who<br/>knows, it is possible that there will be a lot of people that think ET sounds<br/>best, (but I am betting against it!).</p><p>&gt;&gt;I will definitely pull this CD off the shelf whenever I want to hear<br/>these works done on an acoustic piano.  Congratulations, Ed!!&gt;&gt;</p><p> Thanks for the postive comments, John,  I hope you want to hear a lot of<br/>acoustic piano in the future..<br/>Regards,<br/>Ed Foote<br/>Nashville, Tn.</p></div><h3><a id=17817 href="#17817">ðŸ”—</a>John A. deLaubenfels &#x3C;jdl@adaptune.com&#x3E;</h3><span>1/22/2001 9:55:20 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>[Ed Foote wrote:]<br/>&gt;I hadn&apos;t thought that the Kirnberger or Young would need much<br/>&gt;explanation, but our next one has charts and pictures for the<br/>&gt;temperaments used.

The notes say that &quot;Prinz&quot; is used for the first two<br/>sonatas, and Young for the second two.  Is Prinz essentially the same<br/>as Kirnberger?</p><p>&gt;There is resistance,yes.

It is easy to slam the doors by telling a pianist that they<br/>&gt;have been doing it all wrong for their whole life!</p><p>That makes sense.  In the case of Young, at least, Kyle Gann makes the<br/>comment that the difference between it and 12-tET is most apparent to<br/>the performer.  Do you agree?</p><p>&gt;The jazz crowd, OTOH, has been digging into the WT sounds with a vigor,<br/>&gt;around here.

Of<br/>course, there will also be subtle differences in the three performances,<br/>difficult or impossible to control in the organic/acoustic world.</p><p>&gt;&gt;I will definitely pull this CD off the shelf whenever I want to hear<br/>&gt;&gt;these works done on an acoustic piano.  Congratulations, Ed!!</p><p>&gt;Thanks for the postive comments, John,  I hope you want to hear a lot<br/>&gt;of acoustic piano in the future..</p><p>Oh, I LOVE acoustic grand pianos, no doubt!  As a college student, a<br/>non-music major, I used the piano practice rooms for study and<br/>improvisation, and would usually get stuck with a horrible upright piano<br/>(&quot;Knight&quot;?).  But if the rooms weren&apos;t in heavy use and I could persuade<br/>the keeper at the desk, I could occasionally get into a room with a<br/>grand piano.  Oh, what a difference!  I found the grand, beyond all<br/>else, evocative in some deep way, that nothing I have touched before or<br/>since has matched.</p><p>That said, my own preferences are highly adaptive by now, and that&apos;s<br/>unlikely to change, I fear.  Tell me, Ed: what are your thoughts on<br/>the possibility of making a grand piano real-time adaptive, given<br/>unlimited resources?  I realize there are serious problems, beyond the<br/>mechanics of turning the tuning pin: the string would have to slip over<br/>the bridge and the other terminating rail (I&apos;ve forgotten its proper<br/>name) very quickly, and without wearing itself to death in a few hours.</p><p>(I have no funds for such a project, but have vowed that, if I ever am<br/>able, I will investigate the possibility as far as it can be taken).</p><p>Keep those CD&apos;s coming!</p><p>JdL</p></div>
