Both chords contain a 21/16 interval<br/>&gt;&gt; that is best tempered away. Even better than 12-tET for this is<br/>&gt;&gt; (surprise) 22-tET, due to its better 7/6 and 7/4. Alternative rockers<br/>of<br/>&gt;&gt; the future, take note!</p><p>&gt;And what do you mean by &quot;a 21/16 interval that is best tempered<br/>&gt;away&quot;?  Is that implying that there&apos;s something intrinsically<br/>&gt;wrong with the JI versions? Or that the ET versions are intrinsically<br/>&gt;better?</p><p>In terms of not having badly mistuned consonances, the ET versions (and an<br/>infinite number of conceivable non-ET tunings) sound better than the JI<br/>versions. I prefer a few mildly mistuned consonances to one badly mistuned<br/>one.</p></div>
