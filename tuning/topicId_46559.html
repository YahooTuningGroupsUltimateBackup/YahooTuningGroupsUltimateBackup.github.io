With one pentatonic tuned slightly higher than another. So 10 tones of my series could be used , and is used in just<br/>this musical way.<br/>We know that Slendro comes from China and we know that the chinese has been pouring over this triangle for centuries. If it is<br/>a coincidence , it is a great one. On the other hand we have no examples of chinese attempting to create 5 of 7 equal.<br/>hypothetically, this scales allow also for all types of variations. slendro is many scales, just like this series produce.<br/>Possibly the first slendroes might have been tuned thus way with time allowing even further variations into what we have<br/>today. Like i mentioned , i found that i got really good answers from kunst&apos;s measurements along these lines.<br/>    Quite a few people have pointed out as Pelog being a cycle of 9 tones with usually only 7 tuned up.

As those archives aren&apos;t public, and there&apos;s no concise explanation anyway, I&apos;ll try and  explain it as I now understand it.</p><p>Pascal&apos;s Triangle (Mt Meru) is only used to get what Mathworld seems to call a linear recurrence equation:</p><p><a href="http://mathworld.wolfram.com/LinearRecurrenceEquation.html">http://mathworld.wolfram.com/LinearRecurrenceEquation.html</a></p><p>These always have X[n] depending on two previous entries with coefficients of 1 or -1.  So the first is the usual Fibonacci sequance of A[n] = A[n-2] + A[n-1].  Then B[n] = B[n-3] + B[n-1] which must be the Chopi scale, C[n] = C[n-3] + C[n-2] which is supposed to be slendro and D[n] = D[n-4] + D[n-1] which is sort of pelogic (it converges the other side of 9-equal).</p><p>The significance of these series may be that they specify frequency ratios for a scale to be tuned up.  In which case the equation is specifying that the difference tone between two particular notes in the scale gives another note in the scale.  Hence, with the general form</p><p>X[n] = X[n-a] + X[n-b]</p><p>that can be rearranged as</p><p>X[n] - X[n-b] = X[n-a]</p><p>so the difference tone of the fundamentals of two notes b steps apart gives the note a steps below the higher one.  For this to make sense, you have to have 0&lt;b&lt;a, so I don&apos;t think there&apos;s any loss of generality.  You could consider more terms, but it&apos;d mean more complex patterns of difference tones.  You can also start with different seeds, which I think Kraig is aware of but doesn&apos;t give as examples.</p><p>Each sequence approaches an MOS as the terms approach infinity.  That means that adjacent terms approach a constant ratio.  This result doesn&apos;t depend on the seeds.  Going back to the general form</p><p>X[n] = X[n-a] + X[n-b]</p><p>the converging generator is a solution to the polynomial</p><p>x = 1/x**a  + 1/x**b</p><p>where ** is exponentiation, or equivalently</p><p>x**a = 1 + x**(a-b)</p><p>If you consider octaves as an equivalence interval, than you can introduce powers of 2 as coefficients.

That upper range tones would be 10 vibrations off might be the limit of what one<br/>could do.

In which case they wouldn&apos;t<br/>&gt; have been looking at the same diagonals as you, let along giving them<br/>&gt; significance.  If any of this is relevant, it&apos;s more likely they were<br/>&gt; tuning by the difference tones, or maybe playing with recursive sequences.</p><p>The reference for the history of Pascal&apos;s triangle and combinatorics is</p><p><a href="http://math.truman.edu/~thammond/history/YangHui.html">http://math.truman.edu/~thammond/history/YangHui.html</a></p><p>Having a use for Pascal&apos;s triangle doesn&apos;t mean you&apos;ll end up finding these particular sequences in it.  It&apos;s easier to find them from scratch.</p><p>If somebody were tuning a scale by fourths or fifths, they might notice that some of the difference tones were close to notes in the scale.  If they altered the generators to make the match exact, then they&apos;d end up with the pelog and slendro variants in question.  If this pattern of scales has a significance, that&apos;s likely to be the reason.</p><p>&gt; It isn&apos;t much of a coincidence at all. The number 5 isn&apos;t a &gt; statistically significant match.</p><p>The meta-slendro is only like slendro because it&apos;s like 5-equal.  The convergent generator is 1.0284 steps of 5-equal.  As any random generator must fit 5-equal to within half a step, there&apos;s a 5.7% chance of getting this close by accident.  If you randomly choose 8 generators, there&apos;s a 37% chance that one of them will be this close.  So it isn&apos;t much of a coincidence that a method for producing generators should produce something like 5-equal.  If you don&apos;t get one prominently, all you have to do is try a different method, or give a significance to some other generator.</p><p>For pelogic, you probably want a generator between 3/7 and 5/11 octaves.  As all generators are equivalent within a tritone, this covers 2*(5/11-3/7) = 2*(35-33)/77 = 4/77.  So there&apos;s around a 5% chance a randomly chosen generator will give something like pelogic.  Out of 7 randomly chosen generators, there&apos;s a 31% chance one of them will be within this range.  If you come up with three different ways of producing 8 generators that include something like 5-equal, you can expect one of them to also have a pelogic.  Better than that if you can skew it so that they&apos;re more likely to be around a tritone than around an octave or unison (I don&apos;t know if that&apos;s the case here).  It still isn&apos;t much of a coincidence.  Around 12% of sets of 8 randomly chosen generators will have both pelogic and something like 12-equal.</p><p>                                               Graham</p></div><h3><a id=46643 href="#46643">ðŸ”—</a>Graham Breed &#x3C;graham@microtonal.co.uk&#x3E;</h3><span>8/29/2003 2:08:38 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Paul Erlich wrote:</p><p>&gt;what do you mean? like LLsssss, for example??<br/>&gt;  &gt;<br/>I mean there seems to be a 9 note template behind it, and the 7 notes given are in the Pelogic pattern (like 1 1 2 1 1 1 2 or 1 1 2 1 1 2 1 or something else).

By the way i do have one up which shows the clossness of the<br/>&gt;differance tones with deviations in VPS. since cents is really not something we here as just that.<br/>&gt; <a href="http://anaphoria.com/chopi.gif">http://anaphoria.com/chopi.gif</a><br/>&gt;the other older measurements of Hugh Tracy fit much better but the problem is that his measurements were done comparing the<br/>&gt;instruments against tuning forks 4 vibrations apart. This is the most acturate measurement available of any chopi instrument sent<br/>&gt;to me by Andrew tracy quite a few years ago. I have tried to be tough on the measurements above, but tuning such short decay<br/>&gt;instruments more acturately would be quite hard. That upper range tones would be 10 vibrations off might be the limit of what one<br/>&gt;could do. As i stated with the Kunst measurements , i found a consistent deviation of 2 vibrations throughout. which implies that<br/>&gt;it is also quite possible that such slight deviations are deliberate for musical reasons , not known to us, or is influenced by<br/>&gt;the timbre which migh also have some bearing on the above.<br/>&gt;  &gt;<br/>You get a generator of 2.014/7 octaves, which is good.  There&apos;s only a 21% chance of getting so close to 7-equal by chance.</p><p>That&apos;s 2 vibrations per second?  It could be they&apos;re optimizing beats to be around there.  But I don&apos;t see the consistency.  You have two that match perfectly, three within 1 vps,  and only 2 between 1 and 3 vbps.</p><p>&gt;Then i will pose this question. Tuners are tuning to something . this something would would imagine would be some form of<br/>&gt;acoustical phenomenon. What are they tuning too then?<br/>&gt;  &gt;<br/>I don&apos;t know.  William Sethares showed a fairly good match to the timbres they were using.  Daniel Wolf seems to know more detail going by the SpecMus discussion, but I didn&apos;t follow it.</p><p>&gt;why when he invented 2,000 years after the people of india. if it had been invenrtewd by a white person 2,00 years before pascal,<br/>&gt;no one would suggest such a thing. Also we are not talking about Pascal cause he is outside the culture we are talking aout.<br/>&gt;<br/>No one would suggest what?  Weren&apos;t Tartaglia and Gualtieri white?

It&apos;s hardly a complicated operation<br/>&gt; to do with an arbitrary scale anyway.</p><p>but do the beat patterns line up like they do in this case. One has to listen to them</p><p>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt;Where&apos;s your evidence for slendro coming from China?<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; the balinese says it was brought by a chinese princess<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; That doesn&apos;t sound like a very credible story.</p><p> the story is she brought it as a wedding gift to her balinese husband. The story is widely known in Bali and why would one dispute it<br/>or at least consider it as having some bearing on it history</p><p>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; look at the scales in kunst<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; Isn&apos;t Kunst supposed to be the least reliable source for these things?</p><p> not the most perfect in that we know that he got rid of stretched octaves. still it appears to be more reliable than any other when the subject came up on the gamelan list.</p><p>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; this is approximated by the next series, as are the Chopi scales. By the way i do have one up which shows the clossness of the<br/>&gt; &gt;differance tones with deviations in VPS. since cents is really not something we here as just that.<br/>&gt; &gt; <a href="http://anaphoria.com/chopi.gif">http://anaphoria.com/chopi.gif</a><br/>&gt; &gt;the other older measurements of Hugh Tracy fit much better but the problem is that his measurements were done comparing the<br/>&gt; &gt;instruments against tuning forks 4 vibrations apart. This is the most acturate measurement available of any chopi instrument sent<br/>&gt; &gt;to me by Andrew tracy quite a few years ago. I have tried to be tough on the measurements above, but tuning such short decay<br/>&gt; &gt;instruments more acturately would be quite hard. That upper range tones would be 10 vibrations off might be the limit of what one<br/>&gt; &gt;could do. As i stated with the Kunst measurements , i found a consistent deviation of 2 vibrations throughout. which implies that<br/>&gt; &gt;it is also quite possible that such slight deviations are deliberate for musical reasons , not known to us, or is influenced by<br/>&gt; &gt;the timbre which migh also have some bearing on the above.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; You get a generator of 2.014/7 octaves, which is good.  There&apos;s only a<br/>&gt; 21% chance of getting so close to 7-equal by chance.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; That&apos;s 2 vibrations per second?  It could be they&apos;re optimizing beats to<br/>&gt; be around there.  But I don&apos;t see the consistency.  You have two that<br/>&gt; match perfectly, three within 1 vps,  and only 2 between 1 and 3 vbps.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;Then i will pose this question. Tuners are tuning to something . this something would would imagine would be some form of<br/>&gt; &gt;acoustical phenomenon. What are they tuning too then?<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; I don&apos;t know.  William Sethares showed a fairly good match to the<br/>&gt; timbres they were using.</p><p> the instruments used for pelog and slendro are rthe same design so influence of timbre is questionable.</p><p>&gt; Daniel Wolf seems to know more detail going by<br/>&gt; the SpecMus discussion, but I didn&apos;t follow it.</p><p> i understand he saw it as as a form of tempering, which i have yet  to see  evidence that such an idea could be theirs as much as it is ours</p><p>&gt; &gt;why when he invented 2,000 years after the people of india. if it had been invented by a white person 2,00 years before pascal,<br/>&gt; &gt;no one would suggest such a thing. Also we are not talking about Pascal cause he is outside the culture we are talking aout.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; No one would suggest what?  Weren&apos;t Tartaglia and Gualtieri white?</p><p> i ado not know who these individuals are</p><p>&gt;<br/>&gt; Pascal never claimed to invent it.  It happens to be named after him in<br/>&gt; English.</p><p> what did he call it . do you know?</p><p>&gt; As we&apos;re writing in English, it eases understanding to use the<br/>&gt; English name.  Should we move the whole discussion to Sanskrit if we<br/>&gt; happen to mention somewhere in contact with India?</p><p>If it helps to understand where the tuning comes from yes. When looking at the tuning of other cultures it is far more reliable to base it on things found with in the culture. What ever our own beliefs are, tunings are more often than not, religious objects. we gain no insight into how they come about by pulling them out of it. For instance in<br/>Martin Braun Recent case where you had 6 and 9 tone scales, without knowing that these are the main male and female numbers, one can not figure out just why they stopped at these places.<br/>    There is allot of untranslated math from China and it still seems a possibility that in it we will find an examination of all the diagonals. It seems quite amazing that out side of the single fibonacci diagonal found by Thomas Green in the Fibonacci Quarterly, It appears that Erv is the only one to spot these others. I say this cause i know<br/>there are those on this list who possibly could find others and possibly this might trick you in to proving this wrong:). Erv believes that the Chinese are too smart to overlook such a thing and since they were pouring over this figure for thousands of years, someone you would think have noticed it.</p><p>-- -Kraig Grady<br/>North American Embassy of Anaphoria Island<br/> <a href="http://www.anaphoria.com">http://www.anaphoria.com</a><br/>The Wandering Medicine Show<br/> KXLU 88.9 FM WED 8-9PM PST</p></div><h3><a id=46652 href="#46652">ðŸ”—</a>Carl Lumma &#x3C;ekin@lumma.org&#x3E;</h3><span>8/30/2003 8:53:39 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>&gt;Then i will pose this question.

And if<br/>that is the case why is one of the octaves in your example 1290 cents?</p><p>I see you persist in your obsession with 5-equal.  I assume you know<br/>that the scale you gave from Kunst is remarkably close to it.</p><p><a href="http://anaphoria.com/kunstslendro.jpeg">http://anaphoria.com/kunstslendro.jpeg</a></p><p>It is, in terms of 5-equal relative to 70 Hz,</p><p>-4.04 -1.74 0.00 1.01 2.01 2.99 4.01 5.00 6.01 7.01 8.01 9.01 10.00<br/>11.01 12.01 13.01 14.01 15.38 16.01 17.01 18.01 19.01 20.38 21.01<br/>22.01 23.01 24.01 25.38</p><p>Out of 28 notes, 23 are within 1.1% of 5-equal.  As one of those is<br/>fixed, the probability (according to a binomial distribution) of 22 or<br/>more out of 27 events occurring when the probability of each is 2.2%<br/>comes out at 0.0000000000000000000000000000025%.  That&apos;s very unlikely<br/>to be a concidence.</p><p>Of the 5 notes that don&apos;t fit, two are the lowest two recorded.  And<br/>the very lowest one fits the pattern as accurately as the data can<br/>show.  The three higher notes that don&apos;t fit are all related by<br/>perfect octaves.</p><p>Assuming this is a garbled octave-equivalent scale, the chance of a<br/>random match for 4 out of 4 notes is only 0.00002%.</p><p>So that establishes there&apos;s a correlation to 5-equal.  And a much<br/>better one than you have to coincident difference tones.  That 1.1% is<br/>2.64 cents, or 0.15 Hz at 100 Hz.  Which, in this range (the one you<br/>took your data from) is smaller than the resolution in which the data<br/>are given.  Yet you&apos;re happy to allow deviations of up to 2 Hz<br/>relative to your own theory!</p><p>What good would listening to the scale do?  We&apos;re talking about a<br/>correlation to a mathematical sequence, not an aesthetic judgement.</p><p>No, I will not go through Kunst&apos;s measurements to disprove your<br/>theory.
