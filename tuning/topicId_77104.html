My question may sound dumb and obvious, let me clarify.<br/>Do you think the timing and tuning of blues is in itself expressive in<br/>a different way than other aural-based folk traditions, or is it<br/>uniquely expressive only within its culture?</p><p>Let me clarify once more.  Does a Ukrainian folk singer, well versed<br/>in subtle details of his aural tradition, find blues to have something<br/>particularly unique compared to any other aural tradition that is<br/>foreign to him?  Is the subtlety of expression in his tradition vs<br/>blues comparable or no?  Would a Ukrainian and a blues guy each trying<br/>each other&apos;s tradition feel equally uncertain of the other or judge<br/>each other equally inauthentic?</p><p>I guess my point is this:<br/>I think that there are absolute theoretical things within blues that<br/>are totally valid to understand.  Use of 7th harmonics has a clearly<br/>bluesy feeling.  But deviating from pure harmonies or from the simple<br/>shell of the form is clearly part of the tradition as well.  My<br/>feeling is that the things that are special to blues compared to other<br/>aural traditions CAN be discussed theoretically.  I&apos;d assert that any<br/>aspect of blues that cannot be easily discussed theoretically is<br/>either common to aural traditions in general, or is arbitrary to the<br/>culture (not important that it is one way or another, just that people<br/>got used to it being one particular way).</p><p>I totally agree about the classical interpretations of blues -<br/>nonsense awful junk.  However, the idea of &quot;authentic&quot; blues is harder<br/>to pin down since it is an evolving aural tradition.  Everyone has<br/>slightly different ideas about what does or doesn&apos;t exist in &quot;blues.&quot;<br/> I am not a total blues guy, and my degree is classical guitar, but I<br/>was raised on blues to some degree, have listened to a very wide range<br/>of blues from pop to obscure, and am very influenced by guitarists who<br/>themselves are blues influenced (such as my hero Frank Zappa).  I am<br/>not a classical interpreter of blues by any means.  I do not think in<br/>any sort of classical way about what I play when I&apos;m playing blues,<br/>but I may think theoretically at times.</p><p>Anyway, blues being an American style, I&apos;d argue that the language<br/>relationships (which are definitely there) are very influenced by<br/>English in addition to the African language roots.  Most blues is<br/>certainly sung in English.</p><p>As for theory, it seems to me that harmonic intervals - particularly<br/>7th harmonic relatives - seem to be the foundational grid for a lot of<br/>blues, and what you are saying about not applying theory is more about<br/>not being strict to the grid.  Classical musicians are often not free<br/>enough with interpretations.  The blues feel isn&apos;t just playing a<br/>stiff 7th harmonic, but deviating around it expressively.  But I think<br/>there are still focal points around which deviation happens, and both<br/>those points as well as the forms of deviation can be discussed<br/>theoretically.</p><p>Best,<br/>Aaron Wolf</p><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, &lt;microstick@...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;    Actually, I&apos;ve played blues for so long (over 40 years), that I<br/>don&apos;t think much about the theory behind it...I just DO it.
