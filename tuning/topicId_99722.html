For the 7-limit on up, it&apos;s the one mapping 5/4 to<br/>462 cents. For the 11-limit, 11/8 is mapped to 646 cents, despite that<br/>the nearest direct match to 11/8 in 13-equal is the 554 cent interval.</p><p>These vals are in a race with one another. What does this mean? Does<br/>the auditory system actually change depending on what limit you&apos;re<br/>working within?</p><p>Of course not. For one thing, it means that the patent val, where you<br/>just round each prime off to the nearest match, is often not the one<br/>with the lowest TE error. It also means that none of this has anything<br/>at all to do with music cognition, where you&apos;re free to identify as<br/>many mistuned 5/4&apos;s in a scale that you want.</p><p>We&apos;re dealing with ambiguous ETs here, where a few different vals<br/>produce similar TE errors. How do you pick one? Igs suggests a scheme<br/>based effectively on consistency, which Paul suggested, which I<br/>believe was first put forward by Herman. But, now that we have TE<br/>error to go by, why are we supposed to stick with consistency?</p><p>It seems that the argument is being made that the algorithm being<br/>presented - which is &quot;round each prime off to the nearest match only<br/>in the albitonic scale you&apos;re working with&quot; is superior because it<br/>gets away from math and linear algebra, and supposedly holds some<br/>resemblance to music cognition. The idea that if no better match to<br/>5/4 exists in the specific albitonic scale in which you are working,<br/>then you might as well just give 5/4 to the nearest match, and when<br/>you go to a deep enough MOS that you get a better match, you switch<br/>the mapping. But since when does music cognition work this way? Since<br/>when is there actually &quot;just one 5/4&quot; with your brain switching VF<br/>processing as soon as it gets a better match?</p><p>There is no good way to pick names for extremely ambiguous scales like<br/>this, so in lieu of that, we should just let people do what they want.<br/>If they want to call it Father[8], then that&apos;s as good a name as any.<br/>But to assert that it&apos;s -not- Father because Uncle is a better mapping<br/>isn&apos;t necessarily true, nor is it true that Uncle is the only<br/>cognitively relevant mapping for 5L3s in 13-equal.</p><p>-Mike</p></div><h3>cityoftheasleep &#x3C;igliashon@...&#x3E;</h3><span>6/3/2011 12:55:30 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, Mike Battaglia &lt;battaglia01@...&gt; wrote:</p><p>&gt; There is no good way to pick names for extremely ambiguous scales like<br/>&gt; this, so in lieu of that, we should just let people do what they want.<br/>&gt; If they want to call it Father[8], then that&apos;s as good a name as any.</p><p>No, it&apos;s not.

When I originally asked for a naming scheme, I wanted something transparent, systematic, single-denotative, and obvious.  I wanted names that would tell you exactly what the scale was, rather than just being a &quot;clever&quot;, &quot;fanciful&quot;, and/or &quot;free-associated&quot; word whose meaning is not intelligible without access to a glossary of names.  The MOS scheme that resulted is full of gobbledegook--&quot;Rice&quot;, &quot;Bicycle&quot;, &quot;Mosh&quot;, &quot;Mish&quot;, and the few remaining dwarves, are among the worst offenders.</p><p>Instead of that goofy mess, I use a simple notation: #L+#s.  The scale being debated in 13-EDO is simply 5L+3s (or 5L3s if you don&apos;t like the plus sign; I use the plus sign to remind people that it is in fact an equation, 5L+3s=1200 cents).  It is more compact, more single-denotative, more transparent, and more obvious than the whole MOS naming scheme that was proposed back then, and much less confusing.  Rather than requiring a glossary and memorization of several nonsensical names, the whole nomenclature can be explained in one sentence, and any MOS of arbitrary size can be referenced consistently using the same format.</p><p>I have come to accept that some flights of fancy are necessary for the naming of temperaments, as there are just too many variations and parameters to admit a single concise and transparent taxonomy, but MOS scales are simple and straightforward, and also don&apos;t rest on any debatable psychoacoustic or perceptual qualities (the way some temperaments do).  There is no need to resort to the same fanciful tactics in naming them.  Neither is there any need to borrow temperament names and apply them to MOS families.  Furthermore, at least a few people are catching on with the #L#s nomenclature, and with a little more effort on my part, perhaps even more will catch on.</p><p>-Igs</p></div><h3>Mike Battaglia &#x3C;battaglia01@...&#x3E;</h3><span>6/7/2011 4:04:13 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>On Fri, Jun 3, 2011 at 3:55 AM, cityoftheasleep &lt;igliashon@...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; There is no good way to pick names for extremely ambiguous scales like<br/>&gt; &gt; this, so in lieu of that, we should just let people do what they want.<br/>&gt; &gt; If they want to call it Father[8], then that&apos;s as good a name as any.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; No, it&apos;s not.

(Look up the &quot;missing fundamental&quot; phenomenon for more of<br/>this)<br/>2) You won&apos;t hear any beating, as the partials will all be in<br/>alignment with one another.<br/>3) You&apos;ll hear a sort of &quot;buzzing&quot; effect with the interval, which if<br/>memory serves I believe is more pronounced if the partials of the<br/>timbre are harsher. If you&apos;ve been following my posts on the subject<br/>then you&apos;ll know that I believe that this is abstractly related to<br/>beating.<br/>4) Your brain will try to cognize it according to some kind of learned<br/>interval template, e.g. is this a &quot;major third?&quot; Is it a &quot;minor<br/>third?&quot; How about a &quot;perfect fourth?&quot; etc.</p><p>All of these things might go into your conscious recognition of an<br/>interval. So if, to you, a 5/4 means that it&apos;s so perfectly tuned that<br/>it incorporates all of the above, then to mistune the interval so as<br/>to destroy one of those effects, it won&apos;t really be what you were<br/>thinking of as 5/4 anymore. However, the generally accepted convention<br/>around here is to focus on #1, which is the virtual fundamental that<br/>your brain tries to squeeze out of the interval you&apos;re playing.</p><p>#1 is much less easily destroyed than #2 or 3. Small degrees of<br/>mistuning can pretty much destroy the buzzing effect, and beating is<br/>pretty easy to create. The virtual fundamental effect, on the other<br/>hand, is pretty resilient and can handle a decent amount of mistuning.<br/>In that sense, a mistuned 5/4 might still be &quot;heard as a 5/4,&quot;<br/>although it won&apos;t have all of the aural properties that a justly tuned<br/>5/4 would have.</p><p>The million dollar question here is whether #4 is actually a special<br/>case of #1, or if it&apos;s something else entirely.

And whatever<br/>algorithm the brain uses to put the signal into the &quot;frequency domain&quot;<br/>doesn&apos;t actually put it into the true, classical frequency domain, which<br/>means infinite precision along the frequency axis and zero time resolution.<br/>Rather, the brain settles on a mixed time-frequency representation of the<br/>signal, which has degrees of freedom both in frequency and in time. The<br/>introduction of time resolution means you have to sacrifice frequency<br/>resolution, which downstream creates an uncertainty in the perception of<br/>pitch.</p><p>-Mike</p></div><h3>cityoftheasleep &#x3C;igliashon@...&#x3E;</h3><span>6/7/2011 8:39:32 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>In other words, what Mike is saying is that rational intervals may describe a discrete mathematical or even physical identity, but due to uncertainties in our perceptual faculties, they do not describe our perceptual reality.  Under most normal musical circumstances a mildly-tempered &quot;version&quot; of a Just interval will be functionally indistinguishable from the &quot;real thing&quot;, and in other circumstances a Just interval may even fail to sound Just.</p><p>This is the psychoacoustic validation of the practice of temperament: we can achieve a similar-enough musical effect to JI by using accurate temperaments, and this allows us to &quot;convey&quot; the same &quot;musical information&quot; in a tempered tuning as in a Just one, with the added benefit in the increase in number of available consonances, and the overall simplification of the system of pitch relationships.</p><p>However, the exploration of so-called &quot;exotemperaments&quot;, wherein the tempering out of large commas over a short space in the circle of generative intervals leads to a massive reduction in accuracy, has brought us to new territory.  For example, if you temper a 3/2 heavily so that it &quot;approximates&quot; BOTH a 3/2 and an 8/5, and is tuned so as to minimize the error of approximation to both intervals, you end up with an interval around 750 cents.  This is clearly not a 3/2, and is clearly not an 8/5, either, in fact it&apos;s just about right in the middle between them.  It is an ambiguous interval to Western listeners used to distinguishing between a perfect fifth and a minor sixth.  Because the brain &quot;hates&quot; ambiguity, there is a tendency to &quot;force&quot; or &quot;round&quot; the perception this interval into a familiar category, based on other available perceptual cues.  Thus we are beginning to discover--and I think we here on this list may be the first to discover this, actually--that perceptual cues unrelated to frequency relationships can bias the perception of ambiguously-tuned intervals, and even some unambiguously-tuned intervals.  In other words, we are experiencing phenomena of single intervals--that is, singular frequency relationships--triggering multiple perceptual categorizations depending on musical context.</p><p>Prior to these experiences, it was generally assumed that proximity to certain Just identities dictated intervallic categorical perception.  That is to say, anything within a certain &quot;field of attraction&quot; of a 5/4 was presumed to sound like a major 3rd, and the identity of &quot;major 3rd&quot; was conflated with &quot;proximity to 5/4&quot;.  This is now being challenged.  The current debate is whether this whole &quot;one interval played, multiple intervals heard&quot; experience means that 1) perceptual cues can bias our &quot;harmonic series detector&quot; allowing us to perceive a &quot;played&quot; 9/7 or 13/10 (or whatever) as a &quot;heard&quot; 5/4 (for example), or that 2) our harmonic series detector is not actually our source of intervallic categorical perception.  The latter view holds that a &quot;major 3rd&quot; actually has nothing to do with approximation of a 5/4 ratio, but some other (as yet unknown) factor or set of factors.  I think of this latter view as &quot;the null hypothesis coming back for revenge&quot; against the long-held experimental hypothesis that proximity to certain JI identities dictates categorical intervallic perception.</p><p>Hope that helps,</p><p>-Igliashon</p><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, Mike Battaglia &lt;battaglia01@...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; On Jun 7, 2011, at 7:47 AM, Steve Parker &lt;steve@...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Can you explain more how/why no-one knows?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; The relationship between cognitive and learned factors is a matter of<br/>&gt; continued investigation.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; If I here a 12ET major third I never think it is a 5/4.

Then you go visit your Uncle Steve and listen to him play the piano.  Something sounds a little familiar to you and you ask him to hold down C and E together for a minute, and you go &quot;AHA! That sounds like a 5/4, except there&apos;s a bit of beating going on!&quot;  Meaning that if you could eliminate that beating, it would sound *just like* a 5/4.

Imagine, continuing the above example, you invite Uncle Steve over to hear you play your monochord, and when you play a 5/4, he reacts just like you did to the piano, only instead of saying &quot;that major 3rd sounds like a 5/4&quot;, he says, &quot;that 5/4 sounds like a major 3rd, except that it&apos;s not beating!&quot;</p><p>&gt; If so, then the perception of Father seems to be multistable and<br/>&gt; switches between what you&apos;d call Father and Uncle, and perhaps Dicot<br/>&gt; and Tetracot sometimes too.

As you can see in my links above, TE error<br/>&gt; disagrees with you above the 5-limit and sets the &quot;Father&quot; mapping as<br/>&gt; the optimal one.

It&apos;s not anchored in anything to do with liminal music cognition.  The paradigm becomes unstable near certain boundary conditions.  It works excellently for high-accuracy temperaments, but when we move toward exotemperaments everything goes up in the air and I wonder what the use is anymore of applying the paradigm.  I&apos;ve said this for a long time, actually.  I&apos;ve objected many times that when it comes to inaccurate temperaments, multiple mappings can be applied simultaneously and there is no clear way to differentiate which mapping is valid.</p><p>Take 14-EDO&apos;s 5L+4s scale: is it Semaphore?  Godzilla?  Bug?  Beep?  Some subgroup with a 15/13 generator that equates two of them with 4/3?  Some other subgroup with a 37/32 generator that equates two of them with 43/32?  Depending on who you ask, you might get an argument in favor of any of these--or all, or none of these--mappings.  It all depends on how you&apos;re hearing the intervals, and there is no clear way to determine how any of us are really &quot;hearing&quot; intervals like these.  What if you really *can* hear the identities of high harmonics?  14-EDO excellently renders harmonics 25, 29, 37, 39, 41, 43, 55, and 61.  We ignore that here because most of us are conservative about what we consider JI, and we don&apos;t consider these to be &quot;Just&quot;, but that doesn&apos;t invalidate them as targets of approximation.  These harmonics all have a &quot;sound&quot; to them that we can come to recognize, and there are people like Johnny Reinhard who like to work with these harmonics (though usually in a purely-Rational setting).</p><p>The question we always come back to is, &quot;is it possible to hear something like 26:32:39 as an identity, or does it always sound like an &apos;out-of-tune&apos; 4:5:6&quot;.  People like Kraig and JR who work with extended JI almost always say &quot;the former is true&quot;, whereas people like Paul who have studied psychoacoustics more in-depth tend to say &quot;the latter is true&quot;.  So for me it&apos;s a question of who to trust--the practitioners or the theorists.</p><p>&gt; I have no idea what it is we hear, and I don&apos;t think you do either.<br/>&gt; And I don&apos;t want to impose requirements on people about the<br/>&gt; terminology they&apos;re supposed to use when it&apos;s based on unfounded<br/>&gt; assumptions involving big masturbatory theoretical questions about<br/>&gt; what we hear.

I can&apos;t have been paying attention, then.  I<br/>thought categorical perception was as a (subconscious)<br/>statistical analysis of the things you were perceiving.  So<br/>on hearing an interval of 440 cents, you&apos;d associate it<br/>with a major third, very sharp, because you&apos;d heard a lot<br/>of intervals of around 400 cents (or flatter) before, but<br/>not many between, say, 420 and 480 cents.  If you&apos;d been<br/>exposed to quartertones, maybe you&apos;d have heard that 440<br/>cents as a slightly flat example of a quartertone-expanded<br/>major third.  If you were familiar with 9-limit harmony,<br/>where 5/4 and 9/7 are distinct intervals, that 440 cents<br/>would almost certainly be heard as belonging to the 9/7<br/>category.</p><p>If the 440 cents resolved onto 400 (or even 386)<br/>cents, you&apos;d hear a release of tension, because it fits<br/>a traditional idea of tuning better.  You&apos;d describe that as<br/>a single interval becoming better tuned.  If you heard an<br/>interval of 500 cents resolve onto 400 cents you may also<br/>hear a release of tension, depending on how much you&apos;ve<br/>internalized common practice harmony.  But you&apos;d describe<br/>it as consisting of two different intervals, because<br/>they&apos;re clearly distinct on a 12 note scale.  It&apos;s<br/>categorical perception that allows you to distinguish a<br/>wrong note from a mistuning. In both cases, though, you can<br/>say that the larger interval is within the field of<br/>attraction of the major third.</p><p>One of the points of alternative temperament classes is<br/>that they play with your existing categories of pitch.<br/>It&apos;s possible that, after being exposed to a lot of<br/>near-just music, you&apos;d find 5/4 being the archetype of a<br/>major third instead of 400 cents.  The point of<br/>exotemperaments is then that they confuse even these<br/>categories.  The number of pitch categories is likely to<br/>be reduced when you consider exotemperaments -- not 12<br/>pitches to the octave, but maybe 7 or 5.  At this point,<br/>what may be a wrong note on a chromatic scale may well be<br/>categorized as a mistuning -- and a mistuning of an<br/>identifiable ratio.</p><p>I don&apos;t see any object in constraining what musicians can<br/>talk about as approximations within reasonable bounds --<br/>and I think it&apos;s quite reasonable to consider an interval<br/>with a natural tendency to resolve as approximating the<br/>interval it sounds like it should resolve onto.

For one, you weren&apos;t born knowing what the purple breasted reed warbler sounds like.  It&apos;s an experience you were subjected to post-natally that has since been buried in the subconsciousness.  So what we have hear is a new stimulus triggering a subconscious association with a *memory* by virtue of some similarity between the stimulus and the memory.  That is not at all the same as a familiar stimulus achieving perceptual categorization according some innately-defined categorization schema based on never-before-experienced acoustic properties.  Most Western-trained musicians do not experience pure intervals as such until someone introduces them to JI, and so never have the opportunity to form a  memory of what a 5/4 sounds like, which is then subconsciously invoked every time they hear a major 3rd.</p><p>For two, you have never been aware that the song belongs to something known as a &quot;purple breasted reed warbler&quot;, so it&apos;s not true to say that Uncle Steve&apos;s monochord tune sounds to you like a purple breasted reed warbler (I wish you had picked a bird with a shorter name!).  It sounds like &quot;that birdsong you used to hear watching the sun set behind the chemical weapons factory&quot;.

And melodically, I&apos;d assume that the knowledge of how to<br/>get to a &quot;major third&quot; by way of compound intervals - e.g. whole steps<br/>on top of wholesteps - is more important than the knowledge of how to<br/>get to it directly, e.g. by 5/4. I would, in fact, assume that the<br/>brain gathers as much information as possible about what&apos;s going on.</p><p>Lastly, the idea really isn&apos;t that the brain actually identifies<br/>specific chunks of the harmonic series - it&apos;s not really like &quot;oh,<br/>this is two notes in a &apos;5/4&apos; ratio.&quot; It&apos;s more like, this sound is<br/>actually a high-pass or band-pass filtered part of *INSERT LOW-PITCHED<br/>SOUND HERE*. The actual thing that&apos;s going on is the generation of a<br/>phantom low note, not the identification of a specific dyad in the<br/>series.</p><p>&gt; How about &quot;Daddy?&quot; LOL.</p><p>LOL, this whole thing is f*cked.</p><p>&gt; Well, that&apos;s the problem with the regular mapping paradigm. It&apos;s not anchored in anything to do with liminal music cognition. The paradigm becomes unstable near certain boundary conditions. It works excellently for high-accuracy temperaments, but when we move toward exotemperaments everything goes up in the air and I wonder what the use is anymore of applying the paradigm. I&apos;ve said this for a long time, actually. I&apos;ve objected many times that when it comes to inaccurate temperaments, multiple mappings can be applied simultaneously and there is no clear way to differentiate which mapping is valid.</p><p>What exactly do you view as &quot;the paradigm?&quot; Keep in mind that it<br/>doesn&apos;t seem that people can agree on what the paradigm is. You seem<br/>to be endorsing Carl&apos;s specific interpretation, but it&apos;s not the only<br/>one out there, and he&apos;s been known to change his mind every now and<br/>then anyway.</p><p>&gt; Take 14-EDO&apos;s 5L+4s scale: is it Semaphore? Godzilla? Bug? Beep? Some subgroup with a 15/13 generator that equates two of them with 4/3? Some other subgroup with a 37/32 generator that equates two of them with 43/32? Depending on who you ask, you might get an argument in favor of any of these--or all, or none of these--mappings. It all depends on how you&apos;re hearing the intervals, and there is no clear way to determine how any of us are really &quot;hearing&quot; intervals like these. What if you really *can* hear the identities of high harmonics? 14-EDO excellently renders harmonics 25, 29, 37, 39, 41, 43, 55, and 61. We ignore that here because most of us are conservative about what we consider JI, and we don&apos;t consider these to be &quot;Just&quot;, but that doesn&apos;t invalidate them as targets of approximation. These harmonics all have a &quot;sound&quot; to them that we can come to recognize, and there are people like Johnny Reinhard who like to work with these harmonics (though usually in a purely-Rational setting).</p><p>The issue is that there are just multiple percepts that occur when you<br/>hear a dyad. That&apos;s it, plain and simple. Higher-limit identities may<br/>very well have a role when you start talking about optimizing things<br/>for periodicity buzz, which if I ever work it out will probably be<br/>very similar to Erv Wilson&apos;s stuff on recurrent sequences. You<br/>remember the RI-ified Father chords I posted a while ago.</p><p>Then you also have the VF mechanism, and you also have beating. The<br/>present question is whether or not the bulk of musical &quot;information&quot;<br/>really is communicated via the VF mechanism. If not, then it isn&apos;t<br/>worth exalting on a massive theoretical pedestal, such that when we<br/>talk about &quot;perception of ratios&quot; that we have to always assume this<br/>means VF perception. But if it is, then it is very much worth focusing<br/>on.</p><p>It could also be that the basic idea is to pick nicely-tuned harmonies<br/>just to get the VF mechanism in the brain to stop complaining, so that<br/>you can smoothly communicate information some other way - just like we<br/>want to pick timbres to get the cochlea to stop complaining about<br/>roughness and beating. Or the whole thing could just be comprised of<br/>interlocking parts that hand information off to one another.</p><p>&gt; The question we always come back to is, &quot;is it possible to hear something like 26:32:39 as an identity, or does it always sound like an &apos;out-of-tune&apos; 4:5:6&quot;. People like Kraig and JR who work with extended JI almost always say &quot;the former is true&quot;, whereas people like Paul who have studied psychoacoustics more in-depth tend to say &quot;the latter is true&quot;. So for me it&apos;s a question of who to trust--the practitioners or the theorists.</p><p>Paul has a much more nuanced interpretation of what&apos;s going on than<br/>you wrote above. Paul&apos;s interpretation is more like, if you were to<br/>play this to a baby, with no learned factors at all, and also you&apos;re<br/>playing it after like an hour of silence, so that there&apos;s no biasing<br/>from previously played chords, how would your brain naturally sort<br/>this triad out? What would it sound like? What possible &quot;fits&quot; could<br/>there be? What would the relative distribution of probabilities be?<br/>That&apos;s it. The age-old debate on the tuning list over whether or not<br/>you can learn with enough training to hear 26:32:39 as a chunk of the<br/>harmonic series isn&apos;t something that seems to fit into Paul&apos;s current<br/>paradigm. In fact, I&apos;d hope that the Frere Jacques example would put<br/>this debate to rest, because we saw that people were able to resolve<br/>15:16:17 once they knew what notes they were supposed to &quot;look for.&quot;<br/>However, you have to keep in mind that there is a difference between<br/>being able to &quot;identify&quot; 26:32:39 by hearing its particular pattern of<br/>beating, buzz pattern, mixture of 4:5:6-ness and other things - and<br/>being able to &quot;identify&quot; it by hearing a VF pop out 1/26 down from the<br/>root. People ought to be specific when they talk about which meaning<br/>they mean. Cameron, for example, I sometimes think means the former<br/>meaning, whereas Carl tends to talk about the latter. Whether the<br/>latter should take precedence has to do with what I wrote in my<br/>previous paragraph about how important the VF mechanism is.</p><p>Much has been made of the interpretation that the curve is supposed to<br/>represent a &quot;hard&quot; psychoacoustic limitation on hearing, but that&apos;s<br/>not what Paul endorses. He specifically doesn&apos;t endorse the view that<br/>a low-numbered triad has a &quot;field of attraction&quot; that dominates<br/>everything around it, irrespective of training or cultural upbringing.<br/>To do so would make an assumption about the futility of learning in<br/>influencing F0 estimation, and that isn&apos;t what he intended for HE to<br/>demonstrate. He intended for it to make no claims about learning at<br/>all, and just model what things would be like for a tabula rasa baby<br/>or something like that. The only sense in which 4:5:6 has a &quot;field of<br/>attraction&quot; is that it has a strong probability that will influence<br/>the perception triads in its vicinity - for an untrained listener -<br/>outside of any musical context with things like leading tones that<br/>could bias f0 estimation - that&apos;s it. It isn&apos;t supposed to be the tool<br/>that proves to artists that they&apos;re stuck in a world of placebo<br/>effect.</p><p>Go ask him about it on XA if you want, I just had a phone conversation<br/>with him about this like a week ago. He thinks that the paradigm where<br/>people can&apos;t learn to hear mistuned 4:5:6&apos;s as being anything but<br/>4:5:6 isn&apos;t what the point of HE is supposed to be. And if you ever<br/>delve into some information theory enough to understand his idea, it<br/>actually makes much more sense that way. He&apos;s not convinced about the<br/>hypothesis about categorical perception really being harmonic series<br/>detection, but once I work out some listening tests that debate will<br/>end too.</p><p>&gt; &gt; I have no idea what it is we hear, and I don&apos;t think you do either.<br/>&gt; &gt; And I don&apos;t want to impose requirements on people about the<br/>&gt; &gt; terminology they&apos;re supposed to use when it&apos;s based on unfounded<br/>&gt; &gt; assumptions involving big masturbatory theoretical questions about<br/>&gt; &gt; what we hear. That&apos;s the last thing this group of noobs needs.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Which is why I&apos;m now proposing that we drop the temperament-related names all together when we&apos;re in boundary territory.</p><p>Or we could just pick the most common, notorious, all-purpose, general<br/>temperament for some MOS, and give that the name, which is what people<br/>want to do. Like how you&apos;re never going to hear anyone calling 2L5s<br/>anything but mavila, except for maybe &quot;pelog&quot; or something like that.<br/>So in that case you have &quot;father,&quot; the scale, and then also &quot;father,&quot;<br/>the temperament. If you&apos;re talking about father, the scale, then it&apos;s<br/>assumed you&apos;re also talking about the temperament unless you be more<br/>specific. Sure, why not?</p><p>-Mike</p></div><h3>Mike Battaglia &#x3C;battaglia01@...&#x3E;</h3><span>6/7/2011 5:14:15 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>On Tue, Jun 7, 2011 at 4:50 PM, Graham Breed &lt;gbreed@...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; It was? I can&apos;t have been paying attention, then. I<br/>&gt; thought categorical perception was as a (subconscious)<br/>&gt; statistical analysis of the things you were perceiving. So<br/>&gt; on hearing an interval of 440 cents, you&apos;d associate it<br/>&gt; with a major third, very sharp, because you&apos;d heard a lot<br/>&gt; of intervals of around 400 cents (or flatter) before, but<br/>&gt; not many between, say, 420 and 480 cents. If you&apos;d been<br/>&gt; exposed to quartertones, maybe you&apos;d have heard that 440<br/>&gt; cents as a slightly flat example of a quartertone-expanded<br/>&gt; major third. If you were familiar with 9-limit harmony,<br/>&gt; where 5/4 and 9/7 are distinct intervals, that 440 cents<br/>&gt; would almost certainly be heard as belonging to the 9/7<br/>&gt; category.</p><p>Which is another good option. We need to find ways to test all of these.</p><p>I note that the 240 cent intervals in 15-equal are definitely<br/>something new, something between secondness and thirdness. You can<br/>squeeze them into the major second box, but it&apos;s a tough fit. You can<br/>also put them into the minor third box, but there&apos;s too much room. I<br/>meditated on that for a little bit last night and came to the<br/>conclusion that this is what &quot;8/7-ness&quot; was. But I also note that<br/>&quot;major secondness&quot; seems to correlate with 9/8-ness, though, which is<br/>interesting. I&apos;m still not sure what minor thirdness correlates with.</p><p>Whatever it is, it doesn&apos;t seem to actually have anything to do with<br/>whether it really is the &quot;third&quot; scale degree or not, because major<br/>thirds in diminished[8] or the altered scale are actually diminished<br/>fourths, but they work just fine. Conversely, the minor third in the<br/>altered scale is also generally used as a #9, although you can always<br/>just treat it as a minor third in a half diminished chord or<br/>something.</p><p>There does seem to be something that can make an interval &quot;function<br/>differently&quot; in different circumstances, but scalar position doesn&apos;t<br/>look like the magic bullet.</p><p>&gt; One of the points of alternative temperament classes is<br/>&gt; that they play with your existing categories of pitch.<br/>&gt; It&apos;s possible that, after being exposed to a lot of<br/>&gt; near-just music, you&apos;d find 5/4 being the archetype of a<br/>&gt; major third instead of 400 cents.</p><p>Another interesting thing - when I move from 12-equal to 31-equal, at<br/>first, the major thirds sound flat and the major seconds even worse.<br/>Once I play a segment of the circle of fifths, however, something in<br/>my brain rewires itself to make it all right again. So if I play<br/>C-G-D-A-E, just notes, not chords, then I go play C-E again, suddenly<br/>the 5/4 sounds correct. Then, when I move back to 12-equal, the same<br/>process fixes it over there. So perhaps part of the perception of the<br/>common practice major third is an awareness of how it&apos;s reachable by<br/>fifth, which is to say an internalization of the 81/80 comma pump.</p><p>This also highlights another idea I&apos;ve been throwing around, which is<br/>that of the perception of &quot;compound&quot; intervals. Just like you can have<br/>an awareness of 5/4 as a prime interval, as well as a composite<br/>interval being reachable by meantone fifth, 9/8 has two modes of<br/>perception - that of being an actual 9/8 from the root, and that of<br/>being two fifths up and an octave down from the root. Play around in<br/>an inconsistent temperament sometime where you have 9/8 as being<br/>distinct from 3/2 * 3/2 - once you really internalize the fact that<br/>the 9/8 doesn&apos;t have anything to do with &quot;fifths&quot; anymore, it can<br/>sometimes start to take on a very different character; cold and<br/>resonant, like 11/8 or something like that. It becomes a higher-limit<br/>prime both in terms of its mapping and in terms of its perception. To<br/>me, this signifies that we are very much aware of how intervals fit<br/>together to make other intervals, and that this awareness is learned,<br/>not innate. So when you say that we&apos;ll learn to hear 5/4 as being<br/>correct over 400 cents with enough exposure, all I can say is that I<br/>hear it as correct if the fifths are at like 697 cents and I play a<br/>lick around the scale first.</p><p>-Mike</p></div><h3>cityoftheasleep &#x3C;igliashon@...&#x3E;</h3><span>6/7/2011 7:45:00 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;genewardsmith&quot; &lt;genewardsmith@...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt; Maybe it&apos;s just me, but the stuff of yours I like by far the most is when you use accurate<br/>&gt; temperaments.</p><p>I try not to think in terms of accuracy (since everything can be considered accurate depending on choice of targets, using subgroups we can plausibly rationalize any EDO, without exceeding the 19-limit, with reasonably acceptable accuracy), but rather in terms of texture.

Even in the 7-limit, I like a good 5-15 cent deviation, but I also prefer not to have the full complement of the prime-7 ratios.  I prefer just a &quot;taste&quot; of the 7-limit to mingle with the 5-limit stuff.  So I would say that rather than appealing to higher-limit JI to bring exotic sounds into my music (turns out I really don&apos;t actually much like the sound of most 11 and 13-limit intervals), I prefer the sound of oddly-tuned lower-limit intervals.  But like all things a continuum is preferable to absolutes, hence why I include 19-EDO in my arsenal.  Between 16, 17, 19, 20, and 23-EDO, I have a very nice continuum of the 7-limit.</p><p>-Igs</p></div><h3>cityoftheasleep &#x3C;igliashon@...&#x3E;</h3><span>6/7/2011 8:27:22 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, Mike Battaglia &lt;battaglia01@...&gt; wrote:</p><p>&gt; Right, except we don&apos;t know if that particular percept is actually<br/>&gt; what it means to hear an interval &quot;as&quot; 5/4, or if that&apos;s just what it<br/>&gt; means to hear an interval as a &quot;major third.&quot; You know, another option<br/>&gt; that we haven&apos;t discussed is that there&apos;s just more than one harmonic<br/>&gt; percept that&apos;s lumped into this &quot;major third&quot; category - maybe we&apos;re<br/>&gt; aware that it&apos;s some kind of 5/4 above the root, and also aware that<br/>&gt; it&apos;s a &quot;whole step&quot; above a &quot;whole step,&quot; where a whole step means<br/>&gt; 9/8.

Maybe you see it as homosexuals trying to &quot;ban&quot; a word and censor your speech, but hey, guess what, they don&apos;t actually have the power to do that.  The only thing stopping you is your own awareness that any self-respecting liberal is going to look down on you for using the term that way.  Not because &quot;ooh it&apos;s a bad word, like &apos;fuck&apos; &apos;shit&apos; &apos;bitch&apos; etc.&quot;, but because gay people are getting a tough time of it from society pretty much everywhere and it seems immature and insensitive to go on using the term that way if you actually give a shit about what gay people are going through.</p><p>To me I refrain from it voluntarily because I have a lot of gay friends and even in San Francisco they are frequent targets of harassment and derision.  If I were to persist in the naive grade-school usage of the term around my gay friends, they would probably find it hurtful and insensitive.  I think it&apos;s fair to say that gay people, especially gay men and boys, are some of the most heavily-persecuted people in this country (to say nothing of the countries where homosexuality is a crime punishable by death).  Regardless of the fact that you were ignorant of the origins of that usage of the term when you were a kid, you&apos;re not now.  Millions of people all over the country use the term &quot;gay&quot; as a homophobia-based pejorative, because the majority of society is still more or less homophobic.  When I hear an educated adult use the term &quot;gay&quot; negatively or pejoratively, my thoughts are &quot;either this person hasn&apos;t matured since high school, or they&apos;re a homophobe&quot;.  I like to think neither pertains to you, but you are showing a surprising lack of maturity about this particular issue.</p><p>-Igs</p><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;Carl Lumma&quot; &lt;carl@...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; --- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;genewardsmith&quot; &lt;genewardsmith@&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; My imagination??

That has also served as an<br/>effective guide, and FWIW I find it a bit more useful than thinking in<br/>raw JI.

However, you didn&apos;t describe them as<br/>sounding like &quot;strong, resonant 27/20&apos;s.&quot; Here&apos;s one instance in which<br/>the HE paradigm wins out over the JI one. However, HE doesn&apos;t take<br/>into account how 520 cent fourths are going to sound if you grew up in<br/>the Mavila village your whole life - will they still sound wobbly?<br/>What will purely tuned 4/3&apos;s start to sound like to you?

I don&apos;t feel the need to explain sounds, or even necessarily to describe them.  It&apos;s the structural relationships that I am concerned with.  For me, I always start with specific tunings as given, then try to find chords I like, then try to find ways to relate the chords together that I like.  If I were starting w/JI, it would be different--I&apos;d have the chords worked out beforehand and would then be looking for some way to structure them together into a scale.  Or maybe I&apos;d just pick an overtone series and try to analyze the harmonic relationships contained therein.  But anyway all of these paradigms go back to ways of trying to answer the question &quot;if I&apos;m not going to use 12-TET, what can I use instead and how can I make it sound good?&quot;</p><p>&gt; So has HE, which has served as an effective guide at least for me. HE<br/>&gt; represents any interval as the -superposition- of a whole set of just<br/>&gt; intervals, and give you a set of probabilities for how likely you&apos;re<br/>&gt; going to hear something as that interval. That has also served as an<br/>&gt; effective guide, and FWIW I find it a bit more useful than thinking in<br/>&gt; raw JI. But I think we&apos;ve squeezed all the juice out of both of these<br/>&gt; models, which are both obviously very oversimplified.</p><p>Whatever works for you.  For me, what I&apos;m &quot;really&quot; hearing something &quot;as&quot; is not important.  But treating an interval conceptually as 9/7 vs 13/10 vs 41/32 vs 14/11 leads to different ways of relating it to other pitches in the scale.  This to me is more important than what the interval really &quot;is&quot; perceptually.  YMMV.</p><p>&gt; For instance, you&apos;ve described 520 cent fourths before as sounding<br/>&gt; like &quot;drunken, wobbly fourths,&quot; which is a useful idea to communicate<br/>&gt; under some musical circumstances. However, you didn&apos;t describe them as<br/>&gt; sounding like &quot;strong, resonant 27/20&apos;s.&quot; Here&apos;s one instance in which<br/>&gt; the HE paradigm wins out over the JI one. However, HE doesn&apos;t take<br/>&gt; into account how 520 cent fourths are going to sound if you grew up in<br/>&gt; the Mavila village your whole life - will they still sound wobbly?<br/>&gt; What will purely tuned 4/3&apos;s start to sound like to you? Will they<br/>&gt; sound &quot;wrong?&quot; etc.</p><p>Who knows?  Let&apos;s fly to Africa and find out!</p><p>&gt; A paradigm oversteps its bounds when it starts making calls about<br/>&gt; what&apos;s going to sound &quot;good&quot; or &quot;bad,&quot; as in the interpretation of the<br/>&gt; HE curve where a purely tuned 4/3 is supposed to sound &quot;good&quot; and a<br/>&gt; 520 cent mavila fourth is supposed to sound &quot;bad.&quot;</p><p>What I don&apos;t like about HE is that it doesn&apos;t really dictate any structures (although Keenan Pepper&apos;s look at the HE of various MOS scales was rather illuminating, if predictable), and from the curve it is not obvious (or at all apparent, really) exactly which various rational intervals are superimposed at any given point.  What do you see HE as being good for, aside from doing exactly what you don&apos;t want it to (telling us what is supposed to sound &quot;good&quot; or &quot;bad&quot;)?</p><p>&gt; It wasn&apos;t even about that. 11-EDO isn&apos;t really a fantastic Hanson<br/>&gt; temperament. It&apos;s just that we need to give these scales names, and<br/>&gt; there&apos;s no reason to not just let the most notorious temperament name<br/>&gt; that fits that MOS get the trophy, and then be more specific if need<br/>&gt; be.

I suppose you could say it&apos;s really this attempt at anchoring I&apos;m giving up on; I&apos;ve been meditating a lot in the last few days about the &quot;point&quot; of any paradigm of alternative tuning systems.  It seems to me that the purpose of any paradigm is just to help guide musicians through the infinite possibilities available outside the realm of 12-TET.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; One thing I&apos;ve always said of JI is that while I believe the idea that Just intervals are a fiction in general outside of very carefully-controlled listening environments, the JI paradigm allows for the construction of unique musical systems that seem to prove not only useful to some musicians but also productive of some very fine music.  Some of my favorite microtonal music is (at least nominally) in JI.  So while I don&apos;t buy the theoretical &quot;justification&quot; of JI (that these are &quot;pure&quot; intervals and are superior to tempered ones), I can&apos;t deny that the paradigm has served as an effective guide to many people.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I guess this a realization I&apos;ve been failing to apply to the regular mapping paradigm, but which seems to be implicitly understood by the progenitors of the paradigm.  Namely, we should not be concerning ourselves with strict delineations; multiple interpretations are always possible and the validity of an interpretation is determined by its usefulness.  Since we can&apos;t know what every musician everywhere will find useful or not, there&apos;s no point in trying to settle ambiguities.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I guess in this sense I&apos;m conceding to John L. Moriarty, insofar as agreeing that if thinking of 13-EDO as a Father temperament or 11-EDO as a Hanson temperament gives someone a conceptual foot-hold in those tunings that they otherwise can&apos;t figure out, more power to them.  Hell, for all my blathering about 13-EDO really being &quot;Uncle&quot;, I tend to treat it as &quot;A-Team&quot;, the 2.9.21 subgroup that I guess I discovered.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Maybe all the talk of psychoacoustics and what not has been clouding my mind, pushing me toward thinking there is always going to be &quot;one psychoacoustically-correct interpretation&quot; of every tuning, and that we need to figure out what those interpretations are and enforce them on everyone.  But even if there *is* only &quot;one true psychoacoustic interpretation&quot; of everything, that doesn&apos;t really matter so long as there are other interpretations that continue to prove useful despite their falsity/inaccuracy.

Nothing in the paradigm tells you that if you sharp your 3/2 by 15 cents, it&apos;s going to turn your 9/8 into an 8/7, or if you sharp it by 7 cents, it&apos;s going to turn your 81/64 into a 9/7 instead of a 5/4.

Nor does the paradigm tell you that with some timbres, a &quot;high-error&quot; temperament may actually sound better than a lower one.  All the paradigm gives you is a mapping and a minimal error, and it&apos;s up to you to figure out what it all means.  It&apos;s so open-ended that it&apos;s perfectly fine for some people to go around saying that 22-EDO is a Meantone temperament, 11-EDO is a Hanson temperament, 13-EDO is an Orwell temperament, and 7-EDO is pretty much every temperament that generates a 7-note MOS.</p><p>The reason I say that psychoacoustics is not integrated into the paradigm is because the paradigm allows for the existence of temperaments which cannot exist perceptually.  Those absurd temperaments I linked to in the last post don&apos;t exist in reality.  There are no circumstances under which they could be heard as what the mapping tells us they are.  If psychoacoustics were integrated into the paradigm, there would be a parameter that would tell us when a certain mapping is not valid.  If you believe, for instance, that anything tuned as a 7/6 will sound like a 7/6, a mapping that maps 6/5 to an interval around 260 cents would be psychoacoustically invalid.  If you believe that it&apos;s not that simple and that sometimes something tuned like a 7/6 can actually sound like a 6/5, then an integration of psychoacoustics would mean that something would tell you when your mapping of 6/5 to 260 cents is valid and when it isn&apos;t.  As it stands, this is not the case.  Everyone acknowledges that this is not the case, and everyone acknowledges that we all ought to exercise our best judgment when determining what is actually going on temperamentally in music.  Nothing in the paradigm itself prohibits the use of absurd mappings, so we have to use something outside the paradigm--i.e. our good sense, our knowledge of psychoacoustics, etc.--to make our judgments.</p><p>Duh.</p><p>-Igs</p></div><h3>Mike Battaglia &#x3C;battaglia01@...&#x3E;</h3><span>6/11/2011 1:46:02 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>On Sat, Jun 11, 2011 at 4:17 PM, genewardsmith<br/>&lt;genewardsmith@...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; --- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, Mike Battaglia &lt;battaglia01@...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; RTP is a branch of pure math<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I wish you&apos;d look up &quot;pure math&quot; some time.
