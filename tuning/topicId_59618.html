For example, it&apos;s darn awkward trying to notate<br/>a fairly low-order cross-rhythm of, say, 5 against 7.  One of my<br/>earliest pieces notated and realised with NoteWorthy Composer,<br/>called &quot;Cross&quot;, has a shifting triplet group, so that in 4/4 a group of<br/>triplet crotchets (quarter-notes) moves through three positions<br/>within the bar (measure) - the first half-bar, the _middle_ half-bar<br/>and the last half-bar.  When played against a delayed and transposed<br/>copy of itself, we get a shifting hemiole.  This is extremely easy to<br/>notate using just a bracketed triplet.  But to do the same with a<br/>group of 5 or 7 is harder to notate and read - limitations of software<br/>and also of our musical expectations both come into it.  NoteWorthy<br/>1.x can&apos;t notate a quintuplet, tho Sibelius etc can.  It would be<br/>simpler to notate, say, 3 against 5, if we could divide the whole note<br/>into 15 equal parts, and thus dispense with the brackets entirely.<br/>But see below ...</p><p>&gt; (I do note that my friend Joe Monzo has advocated changing the number<br/>&gt; of lines of the musical staff, but I am not, personally, in that camp<br/>&gt; of campers...)</p><p>For increased clarity, placing noteheads only between lines is<br/>one possible way to go - but we&apos;d need ten lines to accommodate<br/>what five lines presently can now in the treble clef, from E4 to F5.</p><p>&gt; &gt; Do you think using third-notes would make it easier for musicians<br/>&gt; &gt; to read and play a hemiole?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; ***I think, basically, the meter would confuse the &quot;hell&quot; out of<br/>&gt; them, to politely use the vernacular for the moment.

I<br/>don&apos;t think Cowell knew that, that but he could hear the way they<br/>sound.  I really enjoy the polyrhythms in Cowell&apos;s music.  The<br/>nature of percussion timbres hardly matters here, especially in<br/>light of the fact that the ratios are not describing simultaneities.</p><p>&gt;I&apos;m not sure that there is any evidence that an inharmonic sound<br/>&gt;being struck at twice the speed of another sound heard at the same<br/>&gt;time has the kind of &quot;special relationship&quot; that one finds in the<br/>&gt;2x multiple of vibrations in the pitch spectrum.</p><p>The overwhelming majority of percussion parts, as notated, are<br/>made entirely of simple-ratio rhythms.  Cowell was suggesting<br/>extending this.  Nancarrow apparently did stuff with irrational<br/>rhythms like sqrt(2)... might be a good exercise to dig up that<br/>stuff and listen for it.</p><p>&gt;I admit that some of these ideas of organization... say<br/>&gt;of &quot;modulating&quot; rhythms according to speed multiples that roughly<br/>&gt;correspond to a multiple of the overtone series might be an<br/>&gt;intresting way to make some textures.</p><p>Glenn Gould was a believer that tempo changes ought to happen at<br/>simple ratios -- in a 1981 (IIRC) interview he describes how he<br/>used this technique between variations in his rendition of the<br/>Goldberg variations.  I had always done this on my scores, before<br/>I knew about just intonation or Glenn Gould.</p><p>&gt;After all, Charles Ives does this in his Universe Symphony... did<br/>&gt;he get the ideas from Cowell or vice versa (probably the latter)</p><p>Or maybe they did it independently... anybody know?</p><p>&gt;However, to boil all this down to some kind of &quot;unified field<br/>&gt;theory&quot; where it all relates, rhythm, meter and pitch, to the<br/>&gt;simple ratios of the overtone series *by necessity* seems<br/>&gt;something of a stretch, no?</p><p>I don&apos;t remember Cowell putting forth such a grand system -- I<br/>remember his approach being one of making suggestions.

There are many<br/>interesting<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; parts of this book.  I just, personally, don&apos;t find the rhythmic<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; part (the largest) one of them...<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; I thought the notation proposal was one of the most interesting<br/>&gt; &gt; in the book...<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; It is *far* easier for me to teach a performer 1/12th of a<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; whole tone or 1/6th of a whole tone than it would be the<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; meter 3/3 (three beats to the measure and a &quot;third note&quot;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; gets one count) or 5/5 (five beats to the measure and a &quot;fifth<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; note&quot; gets one count).<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; Whether or not this is true, I&apos;d like to point out that notation<br/>&gt; &gt; is good for more than being read by &quot;musicians&quot;.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; The reason is I believe, as you state Yahya, the underlying<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; background of the rhythm of music being in 2 or 3 as the<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; fundamental structure.  Sure, it can be changed with &quot;brackets&quot;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; and other enhancements, which is the way it *should* be done,<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; in my opinion,<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; Brackets are clumsey, especially for long or nested structures.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; but to change the fundamental structure would be like replacing<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; our five line staff again with a four-line staff, or a six-line<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; staff or whatever...<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; Heh... *grunt*<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; -Carl<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; ***Hi Carl,<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Well, I don&apos;t want to put a damper on your pedal (accelerator!)...<br/>&gt; I enjoy thinking about new things, and always enjoyed the<br/>&gt; Stockhausen electronic pieces that had oodles of lines for<br/>&gt; staves in graphic form.  I also enjoy looking at Monz&apos;<br/>&gt; quarternote notation.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; However, I kinda wish somebody with practical experience like<br/>&gt; Johnny Reinhard would &quot;weigh in&quot; on this discussion, since I<br/>&gt; really think it&apos;s *much* easier to teach a performer microtonal<br/>&gt; pitch notations or &quot;cents&quot; notations than fundamental changes in<br/>&gt; note shapes to represent fundamental new rhythmic bases for<br/>&gt; music...</p><p>Once again, you&apos;re thinking of only one possible application<br/>for notation.</p><p>Further, I put &quot;musicians&quot; in scare quotes there because the<br/>majority of the world&apos;s musicians do not read common-practice<br/>notation with any proficiency.</p><p>&gt; But in a totally *theoretical* world sure, &quot;go for it&quot;!  :)</p><p>Ever use the piano roll view in a MIDI sequencer?</p><p>-Carl</p></div>
