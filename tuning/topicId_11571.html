I have not read recent messages yet, but I hope to<br/>catch up soon (life is hard, sometimes). A couple of delayed responses.</p><p>-1- AFAIK, there are no mistakes in the tuning tests. If you perceive<br/>a change of tuning in ay other chord than the penultimate one, it<br/>is an effect to note and interpret. Actually I have had professional<br/>and amateur musicians telling me the same thing, or that they perceived<br/>the second repetition of the 12-ET as a repetition of the previous,<br/>non-12ET version.</p><p>-2- At a suggestion offered by Paul Erlich, I have made a new version<br/>of the tests. They have been added on the same web page,<br/>&lt;<a href="http://users.hol.gr/~anakreon/test">http://users.hol.gr/~anakreon/test</a>&gt;.<br/>(The Tibia is interesting. When things get more quiet here I shall<br/>send some comments.)</p><p>Thank you for the comments!   - George K.,  <a href="mailto:anakreon@hol.gr">anakreon@hol.gr</a></p></div>
