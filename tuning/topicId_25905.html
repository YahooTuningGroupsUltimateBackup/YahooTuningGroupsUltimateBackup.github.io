Thanks again.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; What instruments do you have in mind??? You&apos;re not likely to be able to easily get an accurate<br/>&gt; performance in any ET other than 12 on most instruments . . . well maybe 24 . . .</p><p>Well, for example I know two harpists who have expressed an interest in trying out some of my<br/>music. The harp being retunable I have in mind to try to score some guitar 22 tet pieces, some of<br/>which I think you&apos;ll have heard, for two harps (clarsachs),  and to distribute the music between<br/>the two instruments in interesting ways. For this I&apos;ll need to use some variation of conventional<br/>scoring to accommodate the musicians. And I&apos;m in the process of making instruments to be tuned in<br/>other ETs and JI that will need new notations.</p><p>A slightly different scenario is where I have pieces in Just Intonation that I would like to try<br/>for cello in the first instance using the cents deviation system that has been debated on the<br/>list. And I wouldn&apos;t mind challenging  small wind and brass ensembles  with some higher ET music.</p><p>I was under the impression that Johnny Reinhardt had managed to successfully coax multiple ET<br/>music out of largely traditional instruments. Is this the case? I&apos;m also a bit confused as to why<br/>you are proposing 72 tet as a standard if you think that it won&apos;t be easy to get accurate<br/>performances in other than 12 ETs. Or is it because 72 and 12 can be easily related that this<br/>makes 72 more accessible?</p><p>Best Wishes</p></div><h3><a id=25967 href="#25967">ðŸ”—</a>Paul Erlich &#x3C;paul@stretch-music.com&#x3E;</h3><span>7/2/2001 2:20:58 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In tuning@y..., Alison Monteith &lt;alison.monteith3@w...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I was under the impression that Johnny Reinhardt had managed to<br/>successfully coax multiple ET<br/>&gt; music out of largely traditional instruments.
