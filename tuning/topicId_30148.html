Perhaps you have that expression in<br/>Australia<br/>&gt; too.</p><p>Don&apos;t worry Joseph. The entire English speaking world has been so colonised by US television that we know all your idiomatic expressions, even though you don&apos;t know ours.</p><p>&gt; It appears you are saying that your original D-centered scale was<br/>not<br/>&gt; the optimal one.  I&apos;m inferring that Graham Breed figured out the<br/>&gt; optimal one.</p><p>Yes and yes (either that or he&apos;s very close, just my humble opinion).</p><p>&gt; I&apos;m all for getting this eventually pinned down.  However, as you<br/>&gt; know, and as Margo Schulter has mentioned on this list, the<br/>&gt; gravitational pull of &quot;C&quot;  [even moreso, &quot;big daddy&quot; MIDDLE C] has a<br/>&gt; profound influence on our Western musical culture.</p><p>I&apos;m not sure what this implies for our standard Blackjack key?</p><p>&gt; I particularly like the fact that the &quot;middle C&quot; on my keyboard<br/>&gt; matches that of my traditional piano in 12-tET.</p><p>If that&apos;s all, then there&apos;s no problem. Any Blackjack note that is _notated_ the same as a 12-tET note will be _tuned_ the same as that 12-tET note. There&apos;s never been any argument about that.</p><p>&gt; Well, I can see what you&apos;re saying, and C hasn&apos;t become &quot;tonicized&quot;<br/>&gt; in my Blackjack writing so far,</p><p>Has any note? Even temporarily? What notes occur most often in your Blackjack writing so far?</p><p>&gt; but I think, quite frankly, I am more<br/>&gt; concerned about &quot;middle C&quot; being &quot;middle C&quot; on the standard piano<br/>&gt; than that the two small scale steps have to surround it... if that&apos;s<br/>&gt; any help...</p><p>That&apos;s a _huge_ help. So we&apos;ll make sure it has a C natural in it.</p><p>I understand that Allison wants the standard of &quot;A&quot; for<br/>&gt; the same reason...</p><p>Yes. The requirement to have both C and A naturals reduces the field to only 3 possibilities, and means that we must have naturals CGDA and can have no others.</p><p>&gt; I believe there is a tiny error here, since I don&apos;t have an E.  I<br/>&gt; believe it should be Ev.</p><p>Well spotted. I was just testing you. ;-)</p><p>&gt; In &quot;my&quot; system, there are three naturals, and in Graham&apos;s there<br/>&gt; appear to be only FOUR.... so that&apos;s only an addition of *one* more<br/>&gt; natural.  (Better check my math on that, Dave...)</p><p>Correct. :-) But FOUR naturals is the _most_ we can have (in a 12-tET based notation for Blackjack), and I haven&apos;t (yet) found or heard any reason not to have as many naturals as we can.</p><p>Me:<br/>&gt; &gt; Notice something about Graham&apos;s key? Wherever there&apos;s a # there&apos;s<br/>a<br/>&gt; v next to it and wherever there&apos;s a b there&apos;s a ^ next to it. So the<br/>&gt; ^ and v could be omitted if the player was told that # means 5/12<br/>&gt; tone sharp and b means 5/12 tone flat. Then we&apos;d never need more<br/>than<br/>&gt; one accidental per note.</p><p>Joseph:<br/>&gt; Well, quite frankly, I see a tiny problem with this.  I think one of<br/>&gt; the great &quot;virtues&quot; of Blackjack is that it&apos;s a subset of 72-tET,<br/>and<br/>&gt; one of the great virtues of 72-tET is that it *contains* 12-tET in<br/>&gt; all it&apos;s glory...  So, I would prefer leaving the &quot;original&quot; sharps<br/>&gt; and flats of 12 and 72-tET intact and just &quot;add on&quot; from there.  In<br/>&gt; that sense, I find the &quot;double accidentals&quot; actually *simpler!*</p><p>Sure. Forget I mentioned it. But the consistency should still help prevent mistakes and make sight reading easier.</p><p>&gt; 1) A converted &quot;color sticker&quot; keyboard... I&apos;ll do that</p><p>Now that you&apos;re understanding how seeing patterns on the chain of secors helps avoid wolves, maybe you&apos;re ready for a different colouring method. One that has a colour for each chain of secors. The different chains are an octave apart. But we can worry about that later.</p><p>&gt; 2) A converted visual Blackjack lattice of Paul&apos;s design, that I use<br/>&gt; all the time.</p><p>Sure. I will convert this if Paul wants me to. I can even provide #s where needed. ;-)</p><p>&gt; 3) The 10 pages or so of Blackjack chords that Paul made all<br/>&gt; converted (parallel chords) since I use those all the time, too.</p><p>Hmm. I already converted (some of?) these once (more fool me). I&apos;d rather not do it again.</p><p>&gt; 4) The conversion of about 20 to 30 Tuning List posts related to<br/>&gt; my &quot;former&quot; key in Blackjack that I frequently use...</p><p>Maybe some tuning-list software genius can provide a perl script or something to do this, and therefore the chord charts too, assuming they are plain text files.</p><p>&gt; Whew!...  This had better be worth it, Dave.</p><p>I don&apos;t know. Wait and see what others think.</p><p>&gt; So far, Paul Erlich has &quot;weighed in&quot; on the fact that the conversion<br/>&gt; isn&apos;t really worth the effort, at least that&apos;s been my impression.<br/>&gt; (I could be mistaken).</p><p>Well I agree that the conversion from C-centered to D-centered wouldn&apos;t have been worth it. It would still have only had three naturals. Good onya Paul.</p><p>But I think Graham&apos;s proposal, centered on B[, or equivalently centered on the G:D fifth, has significant advantages. I&apos;m dying to hear what Paul thinks. I hope he has some good arguments against it. It wouldn&apos;t be any fun otherwise. ;-)</p><p>Graham, you apparently thought it was so obviously useful that it must have _already_ been the standard.

There&apos;s only one (7-limit) Blackjack lattice. It&apos;s only the pitch names that _can_ change.</p><p>You seem to be confusing one particular periodicity block, in the endlessly repeating lattice, with Blackjack itself. Blackjack is so much more than any particular periodicity block. The PB I gave was simply a single example of a harmonically meaningful one centered on a fifth, rather than on a note.</p><p>Since this PB doesn&apos;t suit you, you should ignore<br/><a href="http://dkeenan.com/Music/Miracle/Blackjack7LatticePBGD.gif">http://dkeenan.com/Music/Miracle/Blackjack7LatticePBGD.gif</a><br/>(It has no necessary relationship to the proposed standard key.)<br/>and only consider<br/><a href="http://dkeenan.com/Music/Miracle/Blackjack7LatticeGD.gif">http://dkeenan.com/Music/Miracle/Blackjack7LatticeGD.gif</a></p><p>Also, I expect you have naturally tended to compose around chords that had simple spellings in the key you are using.

The top line gives the notation for the Blackjack key that is centered on C. The second line shows the only Blackjack key that contains both C and A natural and has the chain of natural fifths centered within the chain of secors. The patterns for otonal and utonal 7-limit tetrads are shown below those.</p><p>By sliding the patterns along we find that the C-centered key has only one otonal and one utonal tetrad whose root (and consequently fifth) is natural (Csm7, FmSM6).

It seems to me that the best bet we have for doing that, is to look at the past. We have in the Scala archive, a repository of scales (but unfortunately not chords) that people have found to be interesting. Unfortunately there is no indication of just _how_ interesting, but it&apos;s a start, and some of us can add that information.</p><p>We know that some 70 or so of these are approximate subsets of Blackjack. See<br/><a href="/tuning/topicId_28857.html#28857">/tuning/topicId_28857.html#28857</a></p><p>Maybe Manuel can suggest how we might easily examine each of these to determine the maximum number of naturals it has when in its optimum position within a given Blackjack key. We could then use these numbers to compare Blackjack keys.</p><p>Note there are two kinds of key being considered here. The Blackjack key within 72-tET and the key of a subset scale within that Blackjack key.</p><p>Some facts about Blackjack in 6x12-tET notation:</p><p>Blackjack has 6 chains of fifths. In 6x12-tET notation these are of course subsets of the 6 cycles of fifths in 72-tET.</p><p>Each chain of fifths will have the same Sims accidental (or none) against all its notes, except for the chain which may have either quarter-tone sharp or quarter tone flat accidentals (or both). So there is the &quot;&lt;&quot; chain, the &quot;v&quot; chain, the 12-tET chain, the &quot;^&quot; chain, the &quot;&gt;&quot; chain and the &quot;[]&quot; chain.</p><p>Blackjack has 3 chains of fifths which are 4 notes long and 3 chains which are 3 notes long. 3*4 + 3*3 = 21</p><p>Naturals can only occur in _one_ chain of fifths (the 12-tET chain). This can either be a chain of 3 notes or a chain of 4 notes. There is no known reason to include anything _but_ naturals in this (12-tET) chain.</p><p>So the number of naturals possible in a subset scale depends entirely on how its chain(s) of fifths can be aligned with the 12-tET chain within the given Blackjack key. Consider the slide-rule pattern of some subset scale. If one can slide it alondg to a position where the subset&apos;s longest chain of fifths coincides completely with the 12-tET chain in the chosen Blackjack key, then it will have as many naturals as are possible.</p><p>If a subset scale has a chain of fifths with 4 notes, it certainly can&apos;t achieve the maximum number of naturals (4) in a Blackjack key whose chain of naturals is only 3 notes long.</p><p>So for every pitch in the subset, we&apos;d like to calculate how many secors it is above or below the 1/1. Then we can find its longest chain(s) of fifths and see how they can be aligned.</p><p>I have a strong feeling that a large number of subsets have chains of four fifths, since it&apos;s probably the most popular interval on the planet, (after the unison and octave).</p><p>Do we really need to do the excercise? Is anyone still not totally convinced that it is better to have 4 naturals than 3 in the standard Blackjack key? If anyone has the slightest doubt, we should do it. So speak up.</p><p>Let me repeat what should be obvious: A standard Blackjack key will not suit every conceivable purpose. There will be times when a composer will have a good reason to use a different one. But we want a standard one as a &quot;lingua franca&quot; and it should be the best compromise we can come up with, such that composers would feel the need to use a different one as rarely as possible.</p><p>Regards,<br/>-- Dave Keenan<br/>Brisbane, Australia<br/><a href="http://dkeenan.com">http://dkeenan.com</a></p></div><h3><a id=30328 href="#30328">ðŸ”—</a>Paul Erlich &#x3C;paul@stretch-music.com&#x3E;</h3><span>11/18/2001 7:51:48 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In tuning@y..., jpehrson@r... wrote:</p><p>&gt; Of course...
