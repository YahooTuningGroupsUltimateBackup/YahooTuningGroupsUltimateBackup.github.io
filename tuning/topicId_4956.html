When tuned to Pythag,<br/>&gt; there are four intervals (those dim4ths) that look and sound like thirds<br/>&gt; (nice surprise) : I guess I wouldn&apos;t call *them* wolves.</p><p>Hello, there, and curiously the diminished fourths of Pythagorean _can_<br/>sound &quot;odd&quot; or even a bit &quot;Wolvish&quot; if one is accustomed for a given<br/>piece or set of pieces to major thirds at a consistent 81:64 (~408 cents),<br/>the usual Pythagorean interval. Around the early 15th century, as Paul<br/>Erlich mentions, this narrow 8192:6561 major third (only a schisma or<br/>~1.95 cents from 5:4) came into vogue, and evidently led by around<br/>1450-1480 to meantone temperament as an effort to obtain such thirds at as<br/>many places in the gamut as possible.</p><p>In 1/4-comma meantone for only 12 notes per octave -- very close to<br/>31-tet, or vice-versa, since the fifth is tempered ~5.38 cents in<br/>1/4-comma and ~5.18 cents in 31-tet -- the wide diminished fourth _is_ a<br/>&quot;Wolf&quot; (~427 cents) in a usual Renaissance setting, but makes a fair<br/>approximation of a &quot;supermajor third&quot; of 9:7 (~435 cents) in &quot;Neo-Gothic&quot;<br/>cadences where a major third expands to a fifth, for example. Marchettus<br/>of Padua _may_ have endorsed such a tuning in his treatise of 1318, as the<br/>Monz and I have discussed here on various occasions.</p><p>&gt; Concerning 12 from 31, there must be intervals that on a keyboard sound<br/>&gt; different in different places -- like the way QCMT has 8 good thirds and<br/>&gt; 4 bad.  What I am now wondering (and I hope this is true) is that in the<br/>&gt; places on the keyboard where the intervals sound unlike what is<br/>&gt; expected, do we get another approximation of a just interval? -- like<br/>&gt; those lucky dim4ths in Pythag?</p><p>Curiously enough, the very wide &quot;Wolf&quot; fifth in 1/4-comma meantone (~737<br/>cents) is an almost perfect 49:32, with a couple of hundredths of a cent.<br/>One can actually use this ratio to derive a rational approximation for the<br/>1/4-comma meantone fifth, dividing 49:32 by 128:125 (the lesser diesis of<br/>about 41 cents) and getting 6125:4096.</p><p>As for the diminished fourth, this is indeed an integer ratio on a<br/>1/4-comma keyboard: 32:25, the difference between a pure 2:1 octave and<br/>two pure major thirds at 5:4 each (making an augmented fifth of 25:16).</p><p>In 31-tet, these intervals would be slightly different -- but very close<br/>to 1/4-comma, I might guess.</p><p>Most respectfully,</p><p>Margo Schulter<br/><a href="mailto:mschulter@value.net">mschulter@value.net</a></p></div>
