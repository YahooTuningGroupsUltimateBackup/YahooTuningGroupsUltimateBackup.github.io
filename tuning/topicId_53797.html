In such cases, there are usually very few people who will join, which is quite similar to the well-known matter of dodecaphonic music. In my view at least, there are much much more people interested in JI than in dodecaphony. Making something like &quot;undecaphonic&quot; or &quot;tridecaphonic&quot; music could, I believe, lead to separating those interested in various tunings into two groups, where one would be significantly smaller than the other. Well, but if you don&apos;t mind, then what&apos;s the problem?</p></div><h3>Afmmjr@aol.com</h3><span>6/30/2004 12:09:55 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>In a message dated 6/30/2004 1:00:47 PM Eastern Daylight Time,<br/><a href="mailto:p.parizek@worldonline.cz">p.parizek@worldonline.cz</a> writes:</p><p>&gt; OK, but if you can say that using the best materials does not guarantee<br/>&gt; compositional success, then I could say that this is interesting only<br/>&gt; &quot;technically&quot; (i.e. as a series of numbers or as a score on paper) but not very much<br/>&gt; for the ear itself.</p><p>Ideas are as important, if not more important, than any ideal of a harmony.<br/>Some music is based on timbres alone, or are only rhythmic.
