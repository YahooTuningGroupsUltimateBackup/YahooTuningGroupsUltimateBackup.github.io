I&apos;ll have to give it a try.</p><p>Two things I&apos;ve tried, but not posted about are:</p><p>1.    A union of three self similar &quot;ratio-derived&quot; scales, built<br/>from 6/5, 5/4, and 3/2. T&apos;was quite a huge scale with very close<br/>pitches (not as playable with the old 12 tone keyboard to me, without<br/>the addition of a number of extra fingers of considerable length).</p><p>2.    Creating a chain of several choice interval sizes, from which a<br/>highly asymmetrical scale is constructed, which is kind of what I<br/>think you are getting at here.</p><p>&gt;<br/>&gt; Of course, if you&apos;re obsessed with symmetry, you might not like this<br/>&gt; idea.</p><p>Not necessarily, but maybe a little! :  )</p><p>&gt;<br/>&gt; Then again, you can always &quot;symmetricalize&quot; anything by turning it<br/>&gt; upside-down and combining with itself.</p><p>Yep. Kind of neat that way!</p><p>I&apos;ll play some more with asymmetrical self similarity, and post a<br/>couple of new ones.</p><p>Thanks for the suggestions!</p><p>Jacky Ligon</p></div>
