The<br/>&gt;&gt;tree in front of you has &quot;1/0&quot;, the one two your left has &quot;0/1&quot;<br/>&gt;&gt;the one up and to the right of you has &quot;1/1&quot;, the one to the<br/>&gt;&gt;right of that one has &quot;1/2&quot;, you get the idea.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;How do you plan on dealing with negatives here?  S&apos;thinks you<br/>&gt;only need the upper-right (+,+) quadrant.  In which case, you&apos;ve<br/>&gt;got a strict &quot;lambdoma&quot; (like Partch&apos;s tonality diamond, but<br/>&gt;starting with 0/0 and proceeding by integer-limit instead of<br/>&gt;odd-limit).  And since this structure has a plane of mirror<br/>&gt;symmetry intersecting its line of 1/1&apos;s, you really only need<br/>&gt;the lower 45-degrees of the quadrant.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt;Also, the closest tree in between two others has the mediant<br/>&gt;&gt;of the their two fractions.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;Closest tree?  Isn&apos;t it the middle tree, only working when there<br/>&gt;are an odd number of trees involved?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt;Get this, the distance a tree is from you exactly corresponds<br/>&gt;&gt;to its musical consonance.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;Inversely, I&apos;m sure you meant.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;For a fraction, a/b, that&apos;s sqrt(a^2 + b^2) -- an integer-limit<br/>&gt;version of the prime-factor measure you&apos;ve posted here before.<br/>&gt;This new version also requires we ignore ratios that aren&apos;t in<br/>&gt;lowest form.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;One interesting thing about this metric is that, like a numerator<br/>&gt;limit for proper fractions, it assigns very low consonance to<br/>&gt;some very wide intervals (like 7/1).  I guess it&apos;s a matter of<br/>&gt;definition what happens to consonance as intervals get very wide.<br/>&gt;We&apos;re used to thinking of consonance and dissonance as mutually-<br/>&gt;exclusive inverses, but perhaps wide intervals are neither<br/>&gt;consonant or dissonant. . .<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt;How well you can see through the trees is harmonic entropy.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;Hurm!  This leaves a lot to the imagination -- perhaps you<br/>&gt;suggest using your distance metric of a given radius, instead of<br/>&gt;a Farey series of a given order, to obtain the initial template<br/>&gt;of ratios.  Since how well you see through depends on how far the<br/>&gt;target tree is from you (as you pointed out), this is not<br/>&gt;unreasonable.  In fact, it&apos;s been proposed on this list before.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;IIRC, the Farey series was liked because the entropy curves it<br/>&gt;produces are well-behaved as its order is changed, and because<br/>&gt;a Farey series of a given order is a list of all the intervals<br/>&gt;in a harmonic series of a certain limit, and it is tempting to<br/>&gt;think that the ear/mind uses a harmonic series as _its_ template.<br/>&gt;The a*b series also had some things going for it... none of which<br/>&gt;I can remember.  And I can&apos;t recall if sqrt(a^2 + b^2) was ever<br/>&gt;tried.  Paul?</p><p>-Carl</p></div>
