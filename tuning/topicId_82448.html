E.g., you use 7-ET right in the beginning, and some readers may not be familiar with that idea.</p><p>- Concerning limits: you may briefly motivate this concept before introducing how to compute something.</p><p>- The term homophonic is often used in a different meaning they what you define <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homophonic_texture">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homophonic_texture</a></p><p>- JI tuning for the minor triad: you may also consider the (equivalent) 1/4 1/5 1/6</p><p>- Why did Bach favor minor keys?

This is main reason for all those dark and bloody Teutonic mythology, deep philosophy, sad music, heavy marches... Can&apos;t be compared with sunny Mediterranean Romanic culture. [BTW the more to the north or south, music usually slow down, as temperature is too low or too high and fingers too frozen or too lazy. Subtropical clima is very good for making music :-)]</p><p>- Could that poor man write more major works with so many children?</p><p>Serious one:</p><p>- Functional harmony offers more possibilities in minor tonality in comparison with major one, and a better and more interesting work with chromatism. It&apos;s enough to compare for example major and minor variations (Mozart, Haydn, Beethoven...), everybody can hear the difference. Major variations sound banal and simple in comparison with minor ones. So not only JSB preferred minor tonality in Baroque and Classicism.</p><p>Daniel Forro</p><p>On 30 Mar 2009, at 9:23 PM, Torsten Anders wrote:</p><p>&gt; - Why did Bach favor minor keys?

But I was just thinking of a brief motivation for a newbie like &quot;The limit is a number which quantifies the complexity of intervals. For example, an octave is a less complex interval than a fourth or fifth, which in turn are less complex than thirds or sixths.&quot; Such a definition might not be water tight, but simple enough for a newbie to grasp.

If anyone knows of<br/>digital copies of this work, I&apos;d like to have a look.</p><p>Barnes&apos;s work was only published in Early Music, never transferred to<br/>digital media and Oxford University Press in their website do not authorise<br/>it<br/>(some recent authors like Lehman have managed to circumvent this<br/>restriction, but otherwise you cannot find Early Music papers online).<br/>Anyway it would not be of much use for you Carl: Barnes only published<br/>statistics for the 24 Preludes  of WTC I and II in Major keys.<br/>(Early Music Vol. 7 pp.236-249).<br/>This limitation has been criticised by no less than two more recent writers.<br/>An unfair criticism, for they obviously did not read Barnes&apos;s paper fully,<br/>as he explains clearly why he did so.<br/>In a nutshell, he found in a preliminary analysis that in the Fugues and all<br/>the pieces in minor modes, Bach wrote much less exposed/consonant major<br/>thirds.<br/>Therefore their influence would be minimal in a statistics for temperament<br/>purposes, and taking them out reduced the workload to a 1/4 obviously.<br/>Having studied Barnes&apos;s statistics extensively, I have to say that his<br/>argument makes absolute sense from a temperament study point of view.</p><p>Pity that for what you are trying to find out here, Carl, it would be VERY<br/>interesting to have Barnes&apos;s statistics for Minor Mode WTC pieces!<br/>[If Barnes ever did any statistics for minor-key pieces, he never wrote<br/>about it as far as I know.]</p><p>Well, the WTC is always there, and Barnes&apos;s method has been fully<br/>scrutinised, shown to make sense and added some complements that make work<br/>both easier and more precise, whether for major thirds or any other<br/>consonant intervals, whether for Bach, WTC or else.<br/>(I had two writings published on the matter long ago, they are now included<br/>in my U.T. book, sections 9.6, 9.7,  21.2, 21.8 and 21.9.)</p><p>For the WTC it is then a matter of having a young Music School student to<br/>seat down and do the statistics!<br/>A week&apos;s work, maybe even less.</p><p>Kind regards,</p><p>Claudio</p><p><a href="http://temper.braybaroque.ie">http://temper.braybaroque.ie</a></p></div>
