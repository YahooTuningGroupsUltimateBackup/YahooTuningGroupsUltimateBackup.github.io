The numbers in<br/>&gt;&gt; the central cells show the degree of the EDO which most<br/>&gt;&gt; closely approximates the ratio, and is given to one<br/>&gt;&gt; decimal place. The actual EDO degree is the integer<br/>&gt;&gt; part of that value, and the amount of error is given<br/>&gt;&gt; to one decimal point as 1/10 of a degree in that EDO.<br/>&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt; If the decimal part is zero, the cell is white. If the<br/>&gt;&gt; decimal part is .1 or .9, the cell is the lightest shade<br/>&gt;&gt; of grey. If the decimal part is .2 or .8, the cell is<br/>&gt;&gt; the next darker shade of grey; .3 or .7, the next darker<br/>&gt;&gt; shade of grey; .4 or .6, the darkest shade of grey,<br/>&gt;&gt; and if it is .5, the cell is black since that ratio<br/>&gt;&gt; can be equally well approximated by the EDO degree on<br/>&gt;&gt; either side of that value.<br/>&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt; The patterns of shade shown on these lattices show<br/>&gt;&gt; interesting correspondences with other lattices I&apos;ve<br/>&gt;&gt; made.

I see<br/>you have chains of fifths running along the top and chains of thirds<br/>running vertically, but I&apos;m still not totally piecing it together or<br/>understanding the significance.
