The use of<br/>csound is not restricted to people who compose and then use csound to solve<br/>particular realization problems.  Indeed, I would not be surprised if the<br/>csound users&apos; community was largely made up of people who started out to<br/>compose and then became progressively more engaged wit technical issues.<br/>Thus, a lot of the work done is more in the form of examples than extended<br/>compositions.</p><p>Pehrson&apos;s alternative suggestion was to use midi. That is not quite right,<br/>as (a) there are countless more mediocre compositions made in midi<br/>environments as in csound, and (b) midi can well be part of a cscound<br/>composer&apos;s workbench. For example, by composing in midi, then rendering a<br/>final recording in csound, which can be much more finely -- and broadly<br/>detailed -- than a pure midi arrangement.</p><p>To John ffitch, I would say, as someone who has lived with the complete<br/>Partch works for a long time  (recordings for 26 years, the scores for 23)<br/>that he was both a significant and uneven composer. When he was good<br/>(Barstow, the Intrusions, Castor &amp; Pollux, Oedipus, The Bewitched, On the<br/>Seventh Day Petals Fell on Petaluma, Delusion of the Fury), he was superb.<br/>Some pieces are near-misses (US Highball, Revelation in the Courthouse<br/>Park),  his failures are sometimes interesting (Even Wild Horses, Dark<br/>Brother), sometimes not (Water! Water!).  His reputation has suffered due to<br/>uneven performances and recordings, and he was not altogether innocent in<br/>this.  The best performances, in my opinion, remain those on the two<br/>Columbia recordings (The World of Harry Partch, Delusion of the Fury), and<br/>The Dreamer That Remains (on the New World release, which include some of<br/>the Intrusions and Li Po songs, as good examples of questionable<br/>performances).</p><p>Daniel Wolf<br/>Budapest</p></div><h3><a id=17269 href="#17269">ðŸ”—</a>D.Stearns &#x3C;STEARNS@CAPECOD.NET&#x3E;</h3><span>1/8/2001 7:46:17 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Daniel Wolf wrote,</p><p>&lt;&lt; The best performances, in my opinion, remain those on the two<br/>Columbia recordings (The World of Harry Partch, Delusion of the Fury),<br/>and The Dreamer That Remains (on the New World release, &gt;&gt;</p><p>The New World &quot;Dreamer&quot; is probably my favorite Partch performance as<br/>well...</p><p>--Dan Stearns</p></div><h3><a id=17324 href="#17324">ðŸ”—</a>Joseph Pehrson &#x3C;pehrson@pubmedia.com&#x3E;</h3><span>1/9/2001 6:32:09 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@egroups.com">tuning@egroups.com</a>, &quot;Daniel Wolf&quot; &lt;djwolf1@m...&gt; wrote:</p><p><a href="http://www.egroups.com/message/tuning/17268">http://www.egroups.com/message/tuning/17268</a></p><p>&gt; I think Mr. Pehrson is first making a category error, in that<br/>csound(which I don&apos;t happen to use myself)is not a school of<br/>compositionbut rather an environment and collection of tools for<br/>realizing compositions.

Your contributions, as I<br/>am more than certain you are aware, our invaluable to our discussions<br/>here, particularly in the historical realm of the so called &quot;Western<br/>Common (very) Practice Period...&quot;  (And others)</p><p>However, I do have to disagree a bit with the statements you make<br/>above.  I remember from my early days in computer music, using &quot;Music<br/>4,&quot; the predecessor of CSOUND in the uproarious &apos;60&apos;s, that the<br/>majority of people working with this computer program were people<br/>majoring in science or mathematics.  Well, yes, many were also<br/>composers, and I am certain that several (though I can&apos;t think of<br/>any) went on to composition careers.  For many of these people, the<br/>WORKINGS of Music 4 was as much &quot;fun&quot; as the final composition<br/>product which, unfortunately because of the interface, was rather<br/>minimal.</p><p>At the risk of boring some of the younger listers... but hang in<br/>there, becase this is kind of humorous... I would like to briefly<br/>describe the process:</p><p>In the first place, there was the &quot;computer.&quot;  No, there were no<br/>&quot;personal computers...&quot;  Imagine that.  The &quot;computer&quot; was a large<br/>black box-building... looking a little like a Moslem shrine (what is<br/>the big one, the &quot;Kabala...&quot;??)  Anyway, of course it was a<br/>mainframe, and an entire building.  The irony is the fact that I am<br/>certain it had the &quot;brainpower&quot; of an average laptop today.</p><p>THEN, there was the issue of the &quot;interface.&quot;  Ahem.  There were no<br/>&quot;computer monitors...&quot;  Sure, people had television sets, but nobody<br/>yet thought to hook one up to a computer... or, at least, they were<br/>only in the prototypical stages...</p><p>For each &quot;run&quot; of the computer program, one had to wait in a long<br/>line, behind a string of science and engineering students until your<br/>number was &quot;called.&quot;  It was a little like fast-food take-out, only<br/>not as speedy....</p><p>Then, you would get a &quot;print out&quot; with the results of your program.<br/>Not any kind of &quot;sound file&quot; but a text print out.  This would show<br/>the results of your program, and for EACH CHANGE... i.e. in a &quot;bug<br/>fix&quot; you had to run the d... thing again and stand in line.</p><p>ADDITIONALLY, in order to make the changes, you had to PUNCH CARDS...<br/>not only were there no monitors, but there were no KEYBOARDS...  You<br/>would then hand these cards to the student behind the fast food<br/>window...</p><p>Is it any wonder that only a limited amount of music could be<br/>produced in this way??</p><p>Also, nowadays each computer has within it, a &quot;digital to analog&quot;<br/>converter... every sound card has one... so we can immediately hear<br/>the music.</p><p>Not then.  There was no such thing anyplace.  The only institution in<br/>the entire Midwest that had one was Oberlin.  University of Michigan,<br/>where this cube existed, didn&apos;t have one...</p><p>So, we all had to ride in a mini-van down to Oberlin to get our<br/>pieces converted.  Frankly, I only had about a 20 second piece and,<br/>as I recall, I never did get to hear it, since some of the<br/>computer-science types had longer affairs that, apparently, took<br/>precedence.  I don&apos;t believe I heard ANY of their efforts either,<br/>however...</p><p>The only &quot;upside&quot; was the fact that this entire class was under the<br/>direction of John Clough... whom many on this list know as an eminent<br/>theory and tuning scholar... so that made it all worthwhile...</p><p>A little bit of humorous history for those interested....<br/>________ _____ ____<br/>Joseph Pehrson</p></div><h3><a id=17362 href="#17362">ðŸ”—</a>Seth Austen &#x3C;acoustic@landmarknet.net&#x3E;</h3><span>1/10/2001 8:35:54 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>on 1/9/01 3:51 PM, <a href="mailto:tuning@egroups.com">tuning@egroups.com</a> at <a href="mailto:tuning@egroups.com">tuning@egroups.com</a> wrote:</p><p>&gt; Message: 10<br/>&gt; Date: Tue, 09 Jan 2001 14:32:09 -0000<br/>&gt; From: &quot;Joseph Pehrson&quot; &lt;<a href="mailto:pehrson@pubmedia.com">pehrson@pubmedia.com</a>&gt;<br/>&gt; Subject: the dark ages of computer music<br/>&gt;</p><p>&gt; At the risk of boring some of the younger listers... but hang in<br/>&gt; there, becase this is kind of humorous...
