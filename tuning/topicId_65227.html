My point in saying &quot;there doesn&apos;t have to<br/>&gt; &gt; be an axis of inversion&quot; is that there doesn&apos;t have to be (and there<br/>&gt; &gt; usually isn&apos;t) a pitch that things are disposed around symmetrically,<br/>&gt; &gt; unlike the case for reflection in pitch-space.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; There is a pitch around which the reflection is an inversion in pitch<br/>&gt; space half of the time.</p><p>Think of C-E-G, all in the octave starting at middle C. Now think of<br/>C#-F#-A. Considered as pitch-classes, the meaningful axis of inversion<br/>is the diameter of the circle of 12 pcs passing in between 0 and 1 at<br/>one end and 6 and 7 at the other. Considered as pitches, there is no<br/>axis of inversion, because there is no symmetry in the pitch domain.<br/>This is what I meant.</p><p>Your sentence above means &quot;in pitch-class reflection, half the time<br/>the diameter that is an axis of symmetry passes through one of the 12<br/>pitches&quot;.</p></div>
