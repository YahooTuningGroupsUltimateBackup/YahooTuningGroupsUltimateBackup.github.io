The<br/>world of scales seems to have different &quot;logic&quot;. those scales that you describe as symmetrical<br/>are so in a very mathematical sense yet they seem not to have &quot;caught on for the most part.<br/>Out of all of these types i like the one that alternates semitones with whole tones.</p><p>Chamelle Leon wrote:</p><p>&gt; Isn&apos;t it true that one could correctly use the term &quot;symmetry&quot; in both the<br/>&gt; sense of describing scales in terms of symmetrical semitonic scale steps<br/>&gt; (like the whole tone scale), or when a just scale has a series of ascending<br/>&gt; ratios which are mirrored downward from the 2/1 by inversion (1/1, 16/15,<br/>&gt; 9/8, 6/5, 5/4, 4/3, 7/5, 10/7, 3/2, 8/5, 5/3, 16/9, 15/8, 2/1)?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Regards,<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Chamelle<br/>&gt; ________________________________________________________________________<br/>&gt;</p><p>-- Kraig Grady<br/>North American Embassy of Anaphoria island<br/><a href="http://www.anaphoria.com">www.anaphoria.com</a></p></div><h3><a id=11314 href="#11314">ðŸ”—</a>Paul H.
