It might be a little sharp of that. (In comparison, the first movement of Bart&iuml;&iquest;&half;k&apos;s Concerto for Orchestra has a G natural at one point in the score that I always hear performed sharp, even as much as a quarter tone.)</p><p>&gt; If you mean &quot;cried for NO one&quot;, though, it sounds like a conscious<br/>&gt; quarter-tone or &quot;neutral&quot; interval, without any real harmonic<br/>&gt; implication in the context, but more like a intentional dissonance,<br/>&gt; the same way certain East European styles contain &quot;ugly&quot; intervals in<br/>&gt; a otherwise diatonic context for expressive effect.</p><p>I do hear a 3/4-tone there!
