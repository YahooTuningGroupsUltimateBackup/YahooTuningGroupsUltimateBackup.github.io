Paul Erlich, formost, but also Joe Monzo, don&apos;t<br/>really feel there is a solid acoustical basis for perceiving<br/>relationships of utonal chords through their &quot;higher&quot; ratios or from the<br/>&quot;guide tone.&quot;  I believe this is also what George Kahrimanis was trying<br/>to research.</p><p>Right, wrong?</p><p>The utonal chords are therefore totally a &quot;fabrication&quot; or construct...<br/>kind of like the serial 12-tone system.... a system which clearly can be<br/>learned for composition, but which is not inherently &quot;natural&quot; to the<br/>acoustical sound world... although some can &quot;stretch&quot; a justification to<br/>try to explain it.</p><p>I understand that the folks over at Anaphoria disagree with this<br/>assessment.</p><p>How can we come to some tentative agreement or assessment of this....<br/>experiments with isolated chords or in musical contexts??  (This aspect<br/>of the experiment ALSO seems subject to some dispute around here...)</p><p>Why am I so interested??</p><p>Well, Paul remembered my reaction to the interesting Daniel Wolf<br/>experiment.  I had THOUGHT two chords had identical pitches... one was a<br/>utonal chord and the other an otonal.  I was slightly wrong... one of<br/>the inner voices had changed by several cents.. however the chords were<br/>still quite similar.</p><p>I heard a &quot;powerful resolution&quot; of the utonal chord to an otonal chord.<br/>At that time I was thinking they were chords of exactly the same<br/>pitches...</p><p>The effect was that of the focus of a lens.  The utonal chord was a bit<br/>blurred, leading to the final clarity of the otonal one, like a picture<br/>coming into focus.</p><p>I was PROFOUNDLY struck by this effect, since it seemed a possible &quot;new&quot;<br/>kind of cadential resolution I had never heard before.  The idea of<br/>bringing such chords into &quot;focus&quot; could be a powerful effect...<br/>particularly in the electronic realm.</p><p>I imagine it would not be easy to incorporate these effects in<br/>compositions, particularly as &quot;new cadences,&quot; but it might be worth it<br/>if it could be done.(??)<br/>Certainly more knowledge and research into the relationships between<br/>utonal chords and utonal and otonal chords would be imperative for this<br/>kind of composition...yes?</p><p>_________ ______ __ __ _<br/>Joseph Pehrson</p></div><h3>George Kahrimanis &#x3C;anakreon@hol.gr&#x3E;</h3><span>8/18/2000 1:46:11 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>&gt;Certainly more knowledge and research into the relationships between<br/>&gt;utonal chords and utonal and otonal chords would be imperative for this<br/>&gt;kind of composition...yes?</p><p>Joseph, you count me in the wrong &quot;side&quot;. The thesis I put to test<br/>is not only that utonality is as &quot;natural&quot; as otonality, but that<br/>the effect spills over to progressions. And that a very large part,<br/>if not all, of the common practice can be tested to conform with this<br/>assumption.</p><p>Good day!<br/>- George K.</p></div>
