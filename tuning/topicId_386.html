Try and get me to understand that<br/>first. Am I right in thinking that these scales are built up of 5 large and<br/>2 small steps? That would be my definition of a &quot;5+2&quot; scale.</p><p>Yes.</p><p>&gt;In that older post of your, you give a list of numbers under the heading<br/>&quot;w - h =2&quot;. Those numbers are the series 3+7n where n is an integer &gt;=0. The<br/>equally tempered 3t+4s scales I&apos;m considering at the moment happen to be<br/>those where t-s is one step. Those scales have 3+7n steps to the octave. So,<br/>they&apos;re the same scales you previously defined as &quot;w - h =2&quot; in a different<br/>context.</p><p>I would say the same n-tET&apos;s, as opposed to &quot;the same scales...&quot;</p><p> &quot;&#xFFFD;Is this like what I&apos;d call septimally double-positive? That is, you start<br/>with a 5+2 scale, and these scales are the ones where the larger interval is<br/>2 steps bigger than the smaller one&#xFFFD;&quot;</p><p>&gt;No. (Unless it also happens to be.)</p><p>What&apos;s that supposed to mean? I&apos;m talking there about the scales originally<br/>defined as &quot;w - h =2&quot;.</p><p>Then yes&#xFFFD; certainly in the (5+2) context of the original post.</p><p>&gt;What do &quot;exterior&quot;, &quot;interior&quot; and &quot;perimeter&quot; mean? I think I remember<br/>seeing them somewhere, but do you have a reference?</p><p>No&#xFFFD;* While all the confusion is no doubt the direct result of my inability<br/>to communicate without perpetrating endless ungainly scenarios&#xFFFD; I personally<br/>can&#xFFFD;t illustrate any of this any better than I did in the Jan 11th<br/>post**&#xFFFD;sorry.</p><p>I&#xFFFD;ve been here on the tuning digest for about a month (since Christmas), so<br/>I suppose that there is at least a possibility that I may get into a better<br/>&#xFFFD;language groove&#xFFFD; with those of you who seem to have little problem<br/>understanding each other&#xFFFD; But presently all I can do is contribute in the<br/>&#xFFFD;language&#xFFFD; I understand (or at least think I do), and see what comes of it.</p><p>Dan</p><p>*And as most all of what I post is based on personal trial and error (rather<br/>than a scholarly or cultivated understanding and maneuvering of the<br/>historical ins and outs) it certainly should be highly suspect - and I<br/>appreciate being alerted to any slack in the facts, so to speak&#xFFFD;</p><p>**THREE SETS OF &quot;O&quot;</p></div><h3><a id=388 href="#388">ðŸ”—</a>Kraig Grady &#x3C;kraiggrady@xxxxxxxxx.xxxx&#x3E;</h3><span>1/21/1999 3:55:13 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Dan Stearns wrote:</p><p>&gt;<br/>&gt; Dan<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; *And as most all of what I post is based on personal trial and error (rather<br/>&gt; than a scholarly or cultivated understanding and maneuvering of the<br/>&gt; historical ins and outs) it certainly should be highly suspect - and I<br/>&gt; appreciate being alerted to any slack in the facts, so to speak&#xFFFD;</p><p>Personal trial and error is the only way to go.
