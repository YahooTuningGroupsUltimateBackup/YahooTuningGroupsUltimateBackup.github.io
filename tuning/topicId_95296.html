The cool thing about it is<br/>that no matter where you go, you can modulate by a 3/2, and the 3/2&apos;s<br/>are unbelievably bright and colorful. Blackwood[10] is the &quot;diatonic&quot;<br/>version, and blackwood[15] is the &quot;chromatic&quot; version, where you can<br/>take the &quot;sound&quot; of something like a melodic or harmonic minor scale,<br/>and symmetricize it Blackwood style. Furthermore, if you start<br/>stacking 5-limit major triads (generating maj 9 chords, and major #11<br/>chords, etc), you end up hitting the root after 5 fifths by<br/>definition, and the whole thing sounds perfectly consonant. It&apos;s<br/>really a remarkable scale.</p><p>So I thought to continue this concept by coming up with the next best<br/>closed cycle of fifths, which is 7-tet*, and then throwing in a second<br/>contorted 7-tet chain such that you get decent 5-limit harmony. So, in<br/>the parlance of regular mapping, it&apos;s the 5-limit temperament that<br/>eliminates 2187/2048.</p><p>Punching this number into Graham&apos;s uv finder for some reason causes it<br/>to crash, but due to hax0ring I got the page here:<br/><a href="http://x31eq.com/cgi-bin/rt.cgi?ets=7_21&error=5.0&limit=5">http://x31eq.com/cgi-bin/rt.cgi?ets=7_21&error=5.0&limit=5</a></p><p>A good tuning for this is 14 out of 35, where the mode is 1 4 1 4 1 4<br/>1 4 1 4 1 4 1 4. The period is 1/7 oct or 171 cents, and the generator<br/>is 34 cents. 3/2 is 686 cents, 5/4 is 377 cents, and 3/2 is 309 cents.</p><p>This also makes for a remarkably simple notation - just use the<br/>numbers 1-7 (or A-G if you want) and the accidentals + and -, which<br/>denote a comma as per HEWM notation, and represent movement by a 34<br/>cent generator. So a major triad would be 1 3+ 5, and a minor triad<br/>would be 1 3- 5, etc. So the 14-note &quot;major&quot; MOS here would be 1 1+ 2<br/>2+ 3 3+ 4 4+ 5 5+ 6 6+ 7 7+, and its &quot;minor&quot; version 1 2- 2 3- 3 4- 4<br/>5- 5 6- 6 7- 7 1-&apos;.</p><p>This has some interesting properties even outside of the ones it<br/>shares with blackwood. One is that there are higher-limit implications<br/>as well, and decent 8:9:10:11:12 pentads over any root where a major<br/>triad exists, but that since this temperament is inconsistent in the<br/>9-limit, the &quot;just&quot; 8:9 approximation to use here is going to differ<br/>from the one you&apos;ll use if dealing with linked 5-limit triads (like a<br/>major 9 chord). Another is that the interval classes aren&apos;t set up the<br/>same way that blackwood&apos;s are - the &quot;just&quot; 9/8 shares a class with<br/>6/5, and the &quot;just&quot; 5/4 shares a class with a 480 cent 5-tet fourth<br/>(!). Having two fourths angers my OCD, but makes for interesting<br/>&quot;minor add 4&quot; chords with the flat fourth. Whether these are<br/>approximating 16:19:21:24 or something else is beyond me, but they<br/>sound nice anyway.</p><p>The 21-note MOS, which is 1 3 1 1 3 1 1 3 1 1 3 1 1 3 1 1 3 1 1 3 1,<br/>has so many higher-limit harmonies (and always transposable by 3/2!)<br/>that it made my brain explode. It&apos;s 4:30 AM and I have to go to bed,<br/>but I think it&apos;s incredible. It&apos;s the &quot;chromatic&quot; version, but instead<br/>of sounding like something analogous to the meantone &quot;chromatic&quot;<br/>scale, it sounds like something analogous to the half-whole octatonic<br/>scale (the kind you use over dominant 7 chords). There are<br/>Stravinskian-sounding higher-limit sonorities everywhere you look. If<br/>we had all started with this scale, the word &quot;chromatic&quot; would mean<br/>something completely different to us. Algorithm: come up with some<br/>really cool higher-limit chord, and then transpose it up the scale,<br/>and listen to how the interval classes change.</p><p>I couldn&apos;t find much information on this temperament - has it been<br/>fully explored? Are there any other cool features I&apos;m missing? Does it<br/>have a name other than 7&amp;14?</p><p>-Mike</p><p>*The next number after this, as we all know, is a closed cycle of 12<br/>fifths, which is compton temperament. Perhaps all of the hip modal<br/>stuff that modern jazz guys are doing stems from their intuitive use<br/>of 12-equal as compton temperament, whereas the blues treat it as a<br/>dominant temperament, and classical music treats it as meantone.</p></div><h3><a id=95299 href="#95299">ðŸ”—</a>Graham Breed &#x3C;gbreed@...&#x3E;</h3><span>12/29/2010 3:59:12 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Mike Battaglia &lt;battaglia01@...&gt; wrote:</p><p>&gt; So I thought to continue this concept by coming up with<br/>&gt; the next best closed cycle of fifths, which is 7-tet*,<br/>&gt; and then throwing in a second contorted 7-tet chain such<br/>&gt; that you get decent 5-limit harmony.

Does it<br/>&gt; have a name other than 7&amp;14?</p><p>Funnily, I arrived to a quasi-similar tuning some years ago, from a<br/>complete other way :<br/>I am using (sqrt(17) + 9) /8 = 1.6403882032022 or 856.84472846532<br/>cents as generator, the solution of the differentially coherent 9x -<br/>4x2 = 4 Dagbhocar algorithm (it is one point that can be found on my -<br/>c diagramm in my article on Differential coherence, if you have it<br/>printed).<br/>It has the rare property to generate a quasi-7-edo, with a fifth of<br/>1.4865061711801 = 686.31054306924 cents, and a Tha&iuml;-like tone of<br/>1.1035192688772 = 170.53418539608 cents (the equivalent to your period).<br/>In order to be effective the differential coherence needs a second<br/>generator of a pure 9/8 to transpose the first sequence, and here<br/>comes the equivalent of your generator, between this 9/8 and the Tha&iuml;<br/>tone =<br/>203.9100017 - 170.53418539608 cents = 33.37581613 cents.<br/>But this new row of the transposed 7-edo requires eventually his own<br/>transposition by 9/8, that sums up to 21 notes and so on to arrive to<br/>a 35-MOS .<br/>So you see this is a very close version of your tuning, with perhaps<br/>more complexity as a temperament but with the -c property in addition.<br/>The reason I was interesting in this double-7 quasi-edo tuning was<br/>for one thing the very circular Tha&iuml; scales it proposes, but mainly<br/>because the Dagbhocar sequence has his own fractal waveform which<br/>provides ideal timbres for the tuning.<br/>It suggests MANY convergent rational sequences, among which this one<br/>I like very much :<br/>231  95  39  1  105  689  4521  (octave-reduced)<br/>The other row would be the same thing  * by 9, and an example of the -<br/>c is :<br/> 144 - 105 = 39<br/>I like very much this sequence because it passes by 2^9 and the<br/>symmetry is impressive - it figurates for example a 4096/4095 schisma<br/>of difference between 64/39 and 105/64.<br/>With more unequal intervals you can start with 559 (13*43), instead<br/>of ending with 4521(3*11*137) :<br/>559 231  95  39  1  105  689, or onn the contrary you can use the<br/>algebra&iuml;c solution of course all the way.</p><p>Note that 1.6403882032022 is the square of (sqrt(17) + 1)/4 =<br/>1.2807764064 which is Daghboc, having its own very strong fractal<br/>waveform, appearing in my list as a correct solution for Sidi<br/>temperament, of which I don&apos;t know much except that it should<br/>normally lead to a quasi 14-edo.</p><p>- - - - - - - -<br/>Jacques</p></div><h3><a id=95308 href="#95308">ðŸ”—</a>Jacques Dudon &#x3C;fotosonix@...&#x3E;</h3><span>12/30/2010 1:18:59 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>A variant of this system here would be to use 3/2 instead of 9/8 as<br/>2nd generator.
