If you&apos;ve heard &quot;foum&quot;...it&apos;s more<br/>&gt;of that tasty foum.</p><p>Cool.</p><p>&gt;Nice overall form too, I think.  Seven variations.<br/>&gt;Each in a different root of two.</p><p>Agreed.  What&apos;s the order of temperaments?</p><p>&gt;The accompanying MIDI and score [probably some dialect of sagittal]<br/>&gt;will be forthcoming, with any luck.</p><p>Ehxcellent.</p><p>&gt;I&apos;m particularly interested in your reactions to the tempos; some of<br/>&gt;them still feel a little wrong to me.</p><p>They seem fine.  The final variation, which you earlier posted as<br/>&quot;foum&quot; is maybe a little slower here?  That&apos;s good -- it was too<br/>fast in the original.  Also, why not upload a 128Kbps version of the<br/>original?  Also, why not upload a &quot;-- preset extreme&quot; LAME version<br/>of the new piece?  Also, why not fill out your ID3 tags, goddamnit.</p><p>&gt;Also, are some variations too imitative of 12-tet for you?</p><p>Not sure what you&apos;re asking here...</p><p>&gt;Also this notion of an innate &quot;mood&quot; supplied by the tuning - any<br/>&gt;thoughts there?</p><p>I&apos;ve interpreted this to mean something like &quot;timbre&quot;.  It&apos;s only<br/>something you&apos;d notice after hearing many different pieces in each<br/>temperament.</p><p>&gt;Also, what&apos;s your favorite moment?</p><p>I like it all.  The trad. (apparently 12-tET) theme.  The slap on<br/>the face of the following (13-tET?) first variation.  The polyrhythms<br/>around 1:45 are maybe my favorite part.  The following near-JI<br/>chords though are fantastic.  Love the following novelty rag, though.<br/>The dynamic change at 4:07 is maybe too extreme, or probably what&apos;s<br/>wrong with it is that you can hear a smooth ramping on either side --<br/>if it were cleanly terraced it might work.  The following walking<br/>boogie-woogie section is BAD!  Love the pattern at 5:30 (which<br/>ends by 5:40).  The impressionist variation is outstanding!  I&apos;m<br/>still trying to decide if the tune at 6:20 and 6:30 is working as<br/>a variation.  I suppose episodes are allowed... it&apos;s &quot;wake up,<br/>suddenly, you&apos;re in love&quot;...</p><p>(googling)</p><p>...which is apparently a Billy Ocean tune.  The carnival of Venice<br/>thing at the end seems to end ubruptly.  Maybe this file is<br/>truncated?  I&apos;ve got 6,825,691 bytes.</p><p>&gt;The &quot;foum simultaneous&quot; also up is just funny/interesting. I think<br/>&gt;you&apos;ll experience it differently depending on whether you&apos;ve heard<br/>&gt;the other version.</p><p>Er...</p><p>&gt;Thank goodness I finished that,</p><p>Welcome to the ranks of the very few who&apos;ve completed a significant<br/>piece of music in an alternate tuning!

OK, re. your RFC on tempos.  The section that was<br/>missing is too fast.  It can stand being too fast for effect, ala<br/>Nancarrow.

It makes<br/>getting the music very hard.  It sometimes crashes my browser.<br/>And apparently it not only insists on hosting low-bitrate files,<br/>it reconverts files automagically (a double-lossy process).  Gag.</p><p>-Carl</p></div>
