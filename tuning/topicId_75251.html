More good might be done by framing it as such. Perhaps someone there will get closer. The models we have, many  get close but always seem to fall short. John Chalmers&apos; The Division of the tetrachord list quite a few &apos;systems&apos; in analyzing tetrachords which correctly focuses on how elusive it is. Helmholtz analyzes things according to roughness and is a good starting point cause this aspect of his work is ignored. It takes into consideration range for one and how an interval changes in its range. The implication is that a 6/5 above C1 is not the same as one above G1. This is just with the same timbre. Sethares work points out how the subject gets evens more complex with timbre. For instance how do we rate a sine wave 6/5 against a complex timbre that is adjusted to fit a minor third of some kind that fits. Ernst Toch pointed out also the influence of context how a F# major chord will be not be consonant against C major. Somethings fail to submit to being converted to numerical data even if they point in the right direction. In the end the only judge we have is our ear and taste.</p><p>M.

Brad<br/>&gt; seems to want to take some advantage of the acoustical identity on the<br/>&gt; keyboard (at least the 12-note keyboard, which was by no means<br/>&gt; universal!) while on the other hand asking us to consider two-voiced<br/>&gt; compositions independently of any keyboard tuning.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Two-voiced compositions, by definition, do not include a full harmony<br/>&gt; - until we have some sort of filling-in parts. If there is no<br/>&gt; complete harmony, the musical function of a tempered interval can<br/>&gt; often be ambiguous, relying on a wider harmonic context for a tonal<br/>&gt; &apos;explanation&apos;. The A minor Prelude of Bach&apos;s &apos;Book 2&apos; (24 Preludes and<br/>&gt; Fugues) is a possible example.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Incidentally there are some &apos;classical-era&apos; compositions for<br/>&gt; fixed-pitch instruments which are *not* &quot;well-composed&quot; in Daniel&apos;s<br/>&gt; sense: notably lute pieces by Silvius Leopold Weiss with enharmonic<br/>&gt; modulation via the augmented triad.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; The celebrated example of an acoustically consonant functional<br/>&gt; dissonance is the perfect fourth above the bass. (Other voicings of<br/>&gt; the fourth may be consonant...) No matter how perfectly in tune it is,<br/>&gt; it always required a resolution.

Are there any pieces at<br/>&gt;     all that satisfy the criteria Brad has demanded : exactly two voices<br/>&gt;     and no influence from keyboard tuning?</p><p>Those weren&apos;t the criteria that I &quot;demanded&quot; or even &quot;said&quot;, as to &quot;no influence from keyboard tuning&quot;.  I did say: &quot;Disregard any and all issues of keyboard temperament.&quot;  That is, consider for the moment a composition apart from any temperament(s) it might be played upon.  How dissonant are augmented 5ths, functionally, as compared with minor 6ths playing EXACTLY the same pitch, however your keyboard may be tuned?</p><p>Want a good example of a composition that plays around with distinctions between augmented 5ths and minor 6ths, at close range?  In exactly two-voiced texture?  Bach&apos;s first Duetto, E minor, BWV 802.</p><p>Look at bars 3, 6, and 35.  In each case we have D in the bass, and either Bb or A# in the treble being struck immediately after the D.  From the context around these moments, bar 36 has (arguably) no dissonance at all in the D-Bb, but bar 3 which also has D-Bb seems at least mildly dissonant...probably under some influence from the enharmonic A# earlier in the same bar.  And bar 6 is (again arguably) the most dissonant of all these three spots, as its A# over the D is within C-A#-B motion.  Bar 23 is similar to 3, but in different octaves; less dissonant?  More?</p><p>There&apos;s also apparently a game here where Bach is not only making enharmonic swaps as closely as possible (e.g. bars 3 RH, 9 LH), but also disguising parallel 5ths between the two voices as closely as possible (bars 2-4, et al).</p><p>Not to say that this Bach example is typical tonal music, though.  I was wondering more about things that are less chromatic overall, yet occasionally have augmented 5ths or augmented 2nds or diminished 4ths showing up between melody and bass.  The more diatonic a piece generally is, the bigger the dissonant effect when one of these augmented or diminished intervals comes up and shatters context...yes?</p><p>Try a simpler one.  Goldberg Variations, variation 1, bar 18 (soon after the middle of the variation).  We have a C in the bass several times, and a G# and later a D# above it: augmented 5th and augmented 2nd/9th. Now flip over to a minor variation, 15, and find a C-Eb such as in bar 26&apos;s downbeat, along with a C-Ab near the beginning of bar 25.  Since this C-Ab and C-Eb are each within the scale of the moment, but the C-G# and C-D# are outside the scale of their moment, don&apos;t these augmented intervals seem a LOT more dissonant than their counterpart minor intervals?</p><p>How about &quot;But who may abide&quot; from Handel&apos;s &quot;Messiah&quot;, bar 108ff, considering only the melody and bass?  We&apos;re in D minor.  The bass goes F-Bb, Bb-A.  The violin has an A over the F, a C# and E over the first Bb, a D over the second Bb, and E-A over the A.</p><p>A, C# E D, E A.<br/>F, Bb..Bb, A...</p><p>So, we&apos;re leaping in contrary motion to land on an excruciating Bb-C# augmented 2nd and then resolving it (properly) outward as the top voice moves up, leaping first to another dissonance (E over the Bb) and finally finding its D, a major 3rd above the bass.  Pick some minor 3rds from anywhere else within this piece, and none of them will seem as dissonant as that Bb-C# augmented 2nd moment...will they?</p><p>Play through the melody and bass of Dido&apos;s Lament (&quot;When I am laid in earth&quot;) from Purcell&apos;s &quot;Dido and Aeneas&quot;.  Doesn&apos;t it make its killer effect by having first an accented diminished 4th on the second bar, and then an augmented 2nd approached by parallel motion (a minor 3rd, and then both notes move down to make an augmented 2nd!) in the third bar?</p><p>G A Bb, Bb A Bn, C Bb A G F# G, F#.<br/>G....G, F#...Fn, E........Eb.., D.</p><p>Brad Lehman</p></div>
