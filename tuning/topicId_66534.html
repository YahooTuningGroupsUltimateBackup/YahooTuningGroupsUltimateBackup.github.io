I go all the way to 17-limit.</p><p>I&apos;m actually using 53-tone as a guide for fretless string instruments (violin, oud, bass). I spent this morning making myself a chart of 31-limit JI intervals. Each is expressed in 665-tET; a Pythagorean comma is divided into thirteen equal parts. You can also use 612-tET, which is a better approximation of 11-limit, but 665-tET has near-perfect fifths and fourths.</p><p>Intervals of up to 13-limit fit in the 53-tone Pythagorean &quot;skeleton scale&quot; fairly well, with exceptions such as 15/11 and 22/15. Intervals using the prime 17 tend to lie in-between degrees, and are best thought of in half-commas.</p><p>I want to use 53-tone for fixed-pitch purposes since the kind of music I write needs stronger fifths and fourths, and I don&apos;t have to be that precise with other JI intervals. 9/8 is halfway between the 13th and 14th degrees of your scale, and I need pure major seconds and 16/9 minor sevenths.</p><p>About 12/11 and 11/10: I represent them as &quot;allophones&quot; of a 7-comma neutral second. The interval 2^/3^22, approximately 156.99 cents, lies in between these two JI intervals (150.64 and 165.00 respectively). 11/10 would be an alternative for 12/11, which is closer to Pythagorean and within my &quot;safe range&quot; of 4 steps in 665-tET or about 7.22 cents.</p><p>~Danny~</p></div><h3><a id=66748 href="#66748">ðŸ”—</a>Gene Ward Smith &#x3C;genewardsmith@coolgoose.com&#x3E;</h3><span>6/6/2006 1:05:08 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;Daniel A.
