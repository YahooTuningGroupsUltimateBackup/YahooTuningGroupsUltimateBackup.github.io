When R=1 this is h7, and as R tends to infinity it<br/>approaches being proportional to h5, so in terms of R, the<br/>recognizable range is 1 to infinity.</p><p>Blackwood introduces the notation pR + q for meantone intervals, where<br/>if u is a 7-limit interval, then p = h5(u) and q = h2(u); this<br/>expresses every meantone interval uniquely. Since h2(2) = 2 and<br/>h5(2)=5, the octave is represented by 5R+2, and hence the tuning of<br/>the interval u by (pR+q)/(5R+2) (as a fraction of an octave; so 1200<br/>times that amount in cents.) Since h2(3/2)=1 and h5(3/2)=3, the fifth<br/>is 3R+1 in this notation, and so R corresponds to a fifth of f =<br/>(3R+1)/(5R+2); solving for R in terms of f gives R = (2f-1)/(3-5f).</p><p>Aside from recognizable diatonic tunings, Blackwood also defines<br/>acceptable diatonic tunings, which have R values from (roughly, at<br/>least) R=1.5 to R=2.2. Subsituting these in the expression for the<br/>fifth in terms of R, this is a fifth from 11/19 to 38/65, or about 1/3<br/>comma to 1/52 comma meantone. However, Blackwood recongizes that 65<br/>(and 53) is really a schismatic temperament system.</p><p>Mathematically speaking, Blackwood proves some elementary number<br/>theory results (including the so-called &quot;fundamental theorem of<br/>arithmetic&quot;, or prime factorization) instead of merely citing them. He<br/>uses &quot;log&quot; to mean base 2^(1/1200), or in other words cents, which<br/>makes sense, but most unfortunately uses &quot;2 exp x&quot; to mean 2^x and not<br/>e^x.</p><p>I don&apos;t agree with some of Blackwood&apos;s characterizations of intervals,<br/>and particularly object to his characterization of 7/6.
