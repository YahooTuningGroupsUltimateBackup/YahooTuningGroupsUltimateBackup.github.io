As we know, maqam/dastgah music is<br/>above all a melodic art, although Ozan and I and others are indeed<br/>producing polyphonic pieces, and some use neutral third sonorities of<br/>various kinds. However, correcting anyone&apos;s misimpressions as to these<br/>points should hardly cause the kind of stir which has resulted.</p><p>What are the real issues, not necessarily or solely factual, in<br/>question? Well, my own position could be summed up about like this:</p><p>    (1) Medieval Islamic theorists describe tetrachords and modes<br/>        which are beautiful and can and should be applied to medieval<br/>        and modern maqamat at least some of the time in some contexts;</p><p>    (2) Some of these tunings are closely approximated by current<br/>        tunings in practical use in various parts of the Near East;</p><p>    (3) Just ratios both simple and complex, as well as values in<br/>        cents, commas, savarts, etc., can be useful in describing and<br/>        analyzing current Near Eastern practice; and</p><p>    (4) Superparticular or other divisions of the medieval theorists,<br/>        as well as some modern variations, can nicely evoke the state<br/>        of _tarab_ (&quot;enchantment&quot; or &quot;ecstasy&quot;) sought by performances<br/>        and audiences as an aspect of the maqam tradition.</p><p>Carl, please correct me if I am wrong in seeing your main points as<br/>follows:</p><p>    (1) You observe that a 24-EDO model can nicely fit some maqam<br/>        perforamnces.</p><p>    (2) You regard medieval Islamic theory, and likewise the<br/>        theory of  Ptolemy, insofar as it involves superparticular<br/>        or other rational ratios of medium to high complexity, as<br/>        having little reference to either the practice of those<br/>        times or of today -- doubtless allowing an exception for<br/>        those of us who deliberately study and then set out to<br/>        implement these tunings.</p><p>    (3) You associate concepts such as &quot;11-limit&quot; with a<br/>        harmonic context where various prime factors are in<br/>        operation (e.g. 2-3-5-7-11, or possibly 2-3-7-11),<br/>        rather than simply a melodic system using ratios such<br/>        as 12:11. If we change &quot;JI&quot; to &quot;RI&quot; (rational<br/>        intonation), and speak of &quot;ratios of 11,&quot; then you<br/>        might be happier.</p><p>    (4) You generally find complex integer ratios more<br/>        confusing that illuminating, and would really prefer<br/>        simply to see measurements in cents.</p><p>While even factual matters in this kind of art often involve a degree<br/>of judgment and opinion, I&apos;ll certainly agree that some Near Eastern<br/>performances nicely fit 24-EDO, and suspect that any reasonable person<br/>would agree that some modern tunings of tetrachords and modes nicely<br/>fit rational medieval models, or can be seen as variations closer to<br/>those models than to 24-EDO, for example.</p><p>Other than that, it&apos;s mostly taste, artistic perceptions, and<br/>opinions.</p><p>Ozan, please let me also give examples of a few of your insights,<br/>sometimes the collective insights or you and your colleagues,<br/>including Can Akkoc, in the paper &quot;Weighing Diverse<br/>Theoretical Models on Turkish _Maqam_ Music Against Pitch<br/>Measurements: A Comparison of Peaks Automatically Derived from<br/>Frequency Histograms with Proposed Scale Tones&quot;:</p><p>     (1) The AEU or mostly Pythagorean model (often featuring<br/>         schismatic 5-limit approximations) for modern Turkish music<br/>         actuals fits some flavors of perforance in maqamat such as<br/>         Rast and Segah, but does not represent important flavors such<br/>         as Rast with rast-segah at around 16 commas or in the<br/>         neighborhood of 360 cents (e.g. 16/13), and fails radically<br/>         to account for prevailing intonational style in maqamat such<br/>         as Ushshaq and Huseyni.</p><p>     (2) As shown in the earlier work of Akkoc, flexible-pitch<br/>         performers tend to focus on regions or &quot;clusters&quot; for a given<br/>         perde or step in a given maqam: for example, evidently,<br/>         peak areas around either 360 cents or so (16/13) or 380 cents<br/>         (5/4) for perde segah in Maqam Rast.</p><p>     (3) In Maqam Ushshaq, the second step above the final peaks<br/>         around 130-140 cents (with 129.7 and 142.2 cents as the<br/>         autopeak envelop and average, dare I say ~14/13 and ~13/12),<br/>         in contrast to the 8 commas or 180 cents specified by AEU.<br/>         Interestingly, however, the neutral sixth when it occurs as<br/>         an alternative to the minor sixth is much higher, peaking by<br/>         either measure at around 872 cents. (Scott Marcus reports a<br/>         similar distinction in Maqam Bayyati (generally corresponding<br/>         to Turkish Ushshaq) in informed Egyptian practice, where the<br/>         neutral second step is around 5-15 cents lower than the<br/>         24-EDO value of 150 cents, but the neutral sixth somewhat<br/>         _higher_ than 850 cents.)</p><p>     (4) In Maqam Hijaz, the autopeak envelope for the second step is<br/>         around 105 cents and the autopeak average around 120 cents,<br/>         while the major third step peaks at around 380-385 cents,<br/>         just below 5/4. The AEU formula of 5-12-5 commas (around<br/>         113-272-113 cents) thus fits the data rather nicely, while my<br/>         favorite tunings for Hijaz are notably off. For example,<br/>         while Qutb al-Din al-Shirazi&apos;s 150-267-81 cents is one of my<br/>         most commonly used models, closely approximated in most of my<br/>         favorite maqam keyboard tunings, as a representation of modern<br/>         Turkish practice it is &quot;Not close, and no cigar,&quot; as you<br/>         might say.</p><p>Thus while some facts seem fairly clear, about 90% of this &quot;debate&quot;<br/>involves opinion, taste (musical and/or theoretical), choice of<br/>emphasis in the selection of materials, and also differences in<br/>musical orientation.</p><p>Carl, what I mean by &quot;differences in musical orientation&quot; might be<br/>illustrated by your response to a piece of Elizabethan music, _Come,<br/>Sirrah Jack, Ho!_ by Thomas Weelkes. From your post, I might guess<br/>that you are more oriented to 18th-19th century tonality, and are<br/>experiencing this composition from around 1600 from that perspective.<br/>From my perspective, when listening to 18th century music, I tend to<br/>look for moments that could be heard as evoking a familiar<br/>16th-century modal context. Either viewpoint is equally real for<br/>the person experiencing it, although curious to someone more<br/>attuned to the other period.</p><p>The same music can, and should, evoke different experiences in<br/>different people. For you, as I read your account, there was an<br/>interesting contrast between features that might fit an 18th-century<br/>framework and those diverging from such a framework. When I heard the<br/>piece for the first time around 1976, I&apos;d guess, on an album of the<br/>King&apos;s Singers, it sounded to me routinely pleasant, without anything<br/>standing out. This might simply show that we have internalized<br/>different musical expectations in certain contexts. And that is fine!<br/>Your analysis fits the theory I&apos;ve been exposed to over the years:<br/>certain kinds of degree inflections or fluctuations I tend to take for<br/>granted, and indeed to cultivate when I&apos;m composing or improvising in<br/>a Manneristic meantone style, are often noted by modern writers as<br/>notable or unexpected from a tonal perspective.</p><p>    &lt;<a href="http://www.bestII.com/~mschulter/IntradaFLydian.mp3">http://www.bestII.com/~mschulter/IntradaFLydian.mp3</a>&gt;<br/>    &lt;<a href="http://www.bestII.com/~mschulter/IntradaFLydian.pdf">http://www.bestII.com/~mschulter/IntradaFLydian.pdf</a>&gt;</p><p>Anyway, I&apos;m wondering how this discussion of maqam music became a<br/>&quot;debate,&quot; much less a &quot;debunking,&quot; when the people on various sides<br/>are mainly making assertions of taste or opinion, which we know &quot;are<br/>not to be disputed&quot;; when there are some empirical facts to support<br/>the style of tuning that each party is focusing on or offering<br/>examples of; and when we know that Near Eastern tunings are, in fact,<br/>incredibly diverse.</p><p>Agreeing affably to disagree, and continuing constructively with<br/>musicmaking and supportive discussions -- whether in maqam/dastgah<br/>styles or others -- would seem to me the best resolution of this<br/>unfortunate episode, for you, Carl and Ozan, for me, and for us<br/>all who share this friendly and quirky virtual space.</p><p>Best,</p><p>Margo</p></div><h3><a id=94048 href="#94048">ðŸ”—</a>Carl Lumma &#x3C;carl@...&#x3E;</h3><span>11/2/2010 1:23:16 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Hi Margo,</p><p>&gt; Please let me express my regrets for any negative part I may<br/>&gt; have had in a &quot;debate&quot; which is clearly intruding on the<br/>&gt; positive purposes of the group and creating more heat<br/>&gt; than light.</p><p>Thanks for saying so, but I didn&apos;t feel you had any negative<br/>part in it.

Answer: the<br/>odds are low and we wouldn&apos;t believe this unless evidence was<br/>plainly extant, de novo, of such a bearing plan, fret placement<br/>instruction, etc. etc.</p><p>&gt;      (3) Just ratios both simple and complex, as well as values<br/>&gt; in cents, commas, savarts, etc., can be useful in describing<br/>&gt; and analyzing current Near Eastern practice; and</p><p>I would dispute this beyond the 7-limit.

In triads<br/>like 10:11:12, 4:7:11 and so on, available on dulcimers and<br/>the like, more can be said of a tendency to gravitate to 11.<br/>However I have never heard these relationships in recordings,<br/>and Santoor tuning instructions I have seen have not mentioned<br/>them.  Now, maybe I should just get out more, which is why<br/>I keep asking for examples.  I get accused of insincerity, or<br/>just ignored, when I do this.</p><p>&gt;      (4) You generally find complex integer ratios more<br/>&gt;          confusing that illuminating, and would really prefer<br/>&gt;          simply to see measurements in cents.</p><p>I find that rationals numbers are used in a quasi-religious<br/>fashion by people purporting to do music theory.  That goes<br/>far outside the maqam realm.  If somebody has a religious<br/>fascination with rational numbers, that&apos;s fine by me!<br/>Just say so from the start, and for heaven&apos;s sake don&apos;t make<br/>objective claims about historical or contemporary musical<br/>tradition(s), supposed health benefits, etc.  That&apos;s dishonest,<br/>disrespectful to the practitioners of said tradition(s),<br/>offtopic, and likely to arouse those with allergies to such<br/>things, such as myself.</p><p>&gt;      (1) The AEU or mostly Pythagorean model (often featuring<br/>&gt; schismatic 5-limit approximations) for modern Turkish<br/>&gt; music actuals fits some flavors of perforance in maqamat such<br/>&gt; as Rast and Segah, but does not represent important flavors<br/>&gt; such as Rast with rast-segah at around 16 commas or in the<br/>&gt; neighborhood of 360 cents (e.g. 16/13), and fails radically<br/>&gt; to account for prevailing intonational style in maqamat such<br/>&gt; as Ushshaq and Huseyni.</p><p>While waiting for Ozan to confirm or deny these details, I can<br/>say I will hardly be surprised if existing theoretical<br/>proposals, of whatever vintage, are found wanting.</p><p>I will add: there is no guarantee that a single master tuning<br/>exists for all the maqamat.  Of course tunings of arbitrary<br/>precision, like 1200-ET or 12,000-ET would probably do the job.<br/>But that would be too easy.  Any such master tuning must<br/>justify itself via some explanatory power, much like a<br/>scientific theory.  It must &apos;explain&apos; or reveal common features<br/>of the maqamat, much like Newton&apos;s laws of gravitation<br/>explained a variety of different observations of motion made<br/>by different people at different times.  Otherwise we can be<br/>perfectly happy knowing a tuning for each maqam, or even at a<br/>finer level of detail (regional, tetrachordal, etc.) as<br/>necessary.</p><p>The master tuning of the West, 12-ET, does in fact have such<br/>explanatory power over Western music, yet it doesn&apos;t go all<br/>the way.  We need the notion of adaptive JI, along with the<br/>idea of disposing of only those commas assumed to vanish in the<br/>score, to get the rest of the way.  Prior to this list I&apos;m not<br/>sure this had ever been fully realized.  Though people like<br/>Bosanquet, Groven, Fokker, and Mathieu were definitely on the<br/>right track.</p><p>&gt; Carl, what I mean by &quot;differences in musical orientation&quot; might<br/>&gt; be illustrated by your response to a piece of Elizabethan music,<br/>&gt; _Come, Sirrah Jack, Ho!_ by Thomas Weelkes. From your post,<br/>&gt; I might guess that you are more oriented to 18th-19th century<br/>&gt; tonality, and are experiencing this composition from around<br/>&gt; 1600 from that perspective.</p><p>It&apos;s hard to say.  My Dad was an early music geek so I grew<br/>up with such things -- and sang them in high school and<br/>college.  But perhaps my tonal indoctrination runs deeper<br/>than I know.</p><p>&gt; The same music can, and should, evoke different experiences in<br/>&gt; different people.</p><p>Absolutely.</p><p>&gt; When I heard the piece for the first time around 1976, I&apos;d<br/>&gt; guess, on an album of the King&apos;s Singers, it sounded to me<br/>&gt; routinely pleasant, without anything standing out.</p><p>I wasn&apos;t alive yet in 1976 but I too first heard this<br/>particular piece on probably that very same King&apos;s Singers<br/>recording.  It sounded completely normal until I tried to<br/>learn the parts.</p><p>&gt;      &lt;<a href="http://www.bestII.com/~mschulter/IntradaFLydian.mp3">http://www.bestII.com/~mschulter/IntradaFLydian.mp3</a>&gt;<br/>&gt;      &lt;<a href="http://www.bestII.com/~mschulter/IntradaFLydian.pdf">http://www.bestII.com/~mschulter/IntradaFLydian.pdf</a>&gt;</p><p>Thanks for reminding about this piece.

As I have already pointed out to you- and as you should already know- the &quot;complex&quot; intervals that actually are in discussion (not &quot;random&quot; intervals) turn out not to complex at all in context. It takes a nice bit of fractal mathematics to describe a &quot;paisley&quot; shape, but all you have to do is make a fist, press the edge of your hand onto wet dye, and voila.</p><p>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;      (3) Just ratios both simple and complex, as well as values<br/>&gt; &gt; in cents, commas, savarts, etc., can be useful in describing<br/>&gt; &gt; and analyzing current Near Eastern practice; and<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I would dispute this beyond the 7-limit.

I claim it is tangible from the point of physical performance, that is, you can feel it in the instrument as an easiness/smoothness, but I honestly don&apos;t if it really is perceptible beyond that, or if that same feeling when listening to others&apos; music is due to other factors. I&apos;m perfectly willing to be tested on this, still waiting for Igliashon to get the chance to make a test.</p><p>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;      (2) You regard medieval Islamic theory, and likewise the<br/>&gt; &gt;          theory of Ptolemy, insofar as it involves superparticular<br/>&gt; &gt;          or other rational ratios of medium to high complexity, as<br/>&gt; &gt;          having little reference to either the practice of those<br/>&gt; &gt;          times or of today -- doubtless allowing an exception for<br/>&gt; &gt;          those of us who deliberately study and then set out to<br/>&gt; &gt;          implement these tunings.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I know of no evidence they&apos;re connected.</p><p>I just presented you with evidence, a year-old instrument methodically fretted to yee anciente intervals found in olde textts. I must admit that I was taken aback at the measurements myself, so I don&apos;t expect you to be convinced. I&apos;m not convinced beyond &quot;it could very well be some people do indeed either deliberately take intervals from old texts, or there are unbroken fretting traditions of great age&quot;.</p><p>To Margo: if you take these things into hand on acoustic instruments, and spend a long time doing so, you will discover that &quot;complexity&quot; is mostly a numerological term here. The physical realities of the allegedly complex ratios in the classic writings are actually delightfully simple.</p><p>&gt;<br/>&gt; Generally the point is that ratios (dyads) of 11 are not<br/>&gt; tunable by ear either harmonically or melodically.</p><p>This is simply not true. I find it difficult NOT to sing 11:8 ( within a couple of cents when shooting for a &quot;low tritone&quot;. Kind of a pain as the tuning scheme I primarily use has low tritones closer to 7:5.</p><p>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;      (4) You generally find complex integer ratios more<br/>&gt; &gt;          confusing that illuminating, and would really prefer<br/>&gt; &gt;          simply to see measurements in cents.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I find that rationals numbers are used in a quasi-religious<br/>&gt; fashion by people purporting to do music theory.

It doesn&apos;t have to be exactly 16:13 to sound &quot;dusky red&quot; to me, but why should I not name this after the nearest address in coincident partials? Better than a wanna-be-scientific attempt at describing it in cents, because the &quot;window&quot; of cents changes with timbre and context, whereas the nearest lowest coincident partials remain the ones called 16 and 13. Though they could just as well be called Groon and Bethsheba.</p><p>&gt;<br/>&gt; I will add: there is no guarantee that a single master tuning<br/>&gt; exists for all the maqamat.</p><p>I think a major cause of contention here is that you don&apos;t seem to have noticed that there is a practical real-life problem which Ozan has been attempting to solve as best he can. This problem is not finding a philosopher&apos;s stone for &quot;all maqam music&quot;, but tuning an actual instrument (quanun) to be as flexible and excellent as possible.</p><p>I don&apos;t get you, man. Don&apos;t you want the &quot;regular temperament paradigm&quot; to see some real action? Ozan advocates 41-equal as a good realistic smaller set of intervallic possibilities for maqam music (so much for bizarre straw characatures of unrealistic expectations of accuracy), and I can tell you from experience that &quot;marvel temperament&quot; in conjunction with tetrachordal modal music works very well indeed. Yet you relentlessly jeer and sneer at the very people who are among the few who both understand the &quot;RTP&quot; and have the means to implement it in ways that might be very very groovy.</p><p>-Cameron Bobro</p></div><h3><a id=94054 href="#94054">ðŸ”—</a>Michael &#x3C;djtrancendance@...&#x3E;</h3><span>11/2/2010 9:03:53 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Margo seems to make it very clear that, in many ways, you were BOTH right in<br/>many cases (and wrong in a few)...and my take is that sort of thing is to be<br/>expected since music is an art: that it&apos;s possible to have more than one<br/>intelligent theory on the exact same topic.</p><p>&gt;&quot;Carl did indeed &quot;debunk&quot; a misconception that maqam music is traditionally<br/>&gt;performed in polyphonic or barbershop-like textures featuring sonorities like<br/>&gt;18:22:27. &quot;...(and Carl regards, according to Margo) &quot;superparticular<br/>or other rational ratios of medium to high complexity, as having little<br/>reference to either the practice of those times or of today&quot;</p><p>...Meanwhile<br/>&quot;Medieval Islamic theorists describe tetrachords and modes which are beautiful<br/>and can and should be applied to medieval and modern maqam at least some of the<br/>time in some contexts;&quot;...&quot;the mostly Pythagorean model (often featuring<br/>schismatic 5-limit approximations) for modern Turkish music actuals fits some<br/>flavors of performance in maqamat such as Rast and Segah, but does not represent<br/>important flavors such as Rast with rast-segah&quot;...&quot;and fails radically to<br/>account for prevailing intonational style in maqamat such as Ushshaq and<br/>Huseyni.&quot;</p><p>So it seems to follow that<br/>A) Indeed Pythagorean theory works in several cases of Maqams and is generally<br/>used melodically and not harmonically...but Pythagorean theory fails to<br/>summarize certain important Maqams and by no means should be considered a<br/>complete summarizing theory for Maqam music.<br/>B) Margo and Ozan&apos;s &quot;non-traditionally&quot; polyphonic music shows a good bit of the<br/>true potential of Maqam music to be performed with harmony and to employ the<br/>kind of tetrachords Islamic theorists describe.

Now that<br/>Margo has made the distinction I think it&apos;s fair to say when I mentioned &quot;dyadic<br/>JI&quot; in Arabic and Persian scales I meant Rational Intonation in proper terms.<br/>And, in fact, I get the feeling Igs and several others have made the same<br/>terminology mistake.<br/>    Carl (repeatedly) seems to assume when others say a &quot;chord&quot; they mean a<br/>segment along the harmonic series (IE under the 25th harmonic or so) and that,<br/>for example, something like 4:5:6:7 is a valid JI chord but something like 1/1<br/>5/4 15/11 23/17 isn&apos;t because it doesn&apos;t reduce well in non-dyadic form.  The<br/>thing is some of us, arguably, believe in &quot;dyadic JI&quot; IE Rational<br/>Intonation...and I don&apos;t think it&apos;s fair to expect people to jump ship and<br/>switch to your favored JI theory because you believe JI involving lower straight<br/>harmonic series chords is so superior.  Personally when I force myself to deal<br/>with only fairly low-limit chords (IE with 11 or so as the highest triadic or<br/>tetradic limit/number AKA Margo&apos;s 2-3-5-7-11 example)...it may sound a bit<br/>better (granted, due to things like the resulting chord having a shorter period<br/>in many cases) but the number of chords possible per scale (compositional<br/>flexibility) if you force yourself to that are so reduced that it&apos;s not worth it<br/>to me.</p></div><h3><a id=94068 href="#94068">ðŸ”—</a>Carl Lumma &#x3C;carl@...&#x3E;</h3><span>11/2/2010 2:04:33 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Cameron wrote:</p><p>&gt; &gt; Seems likely, though the word &quot;closely&quot; can be troublesome.<br/>&gt; &gt; The central point I would stress is that we really don&apos;t have<br/>&gt; &gt; much idea what tunings are currently in use, because of a<br/>&gt; &gt; paucity of data.

As we know, maqam/dastgah music is<br/>&gt; above all a melodic art, although Ozan and I and others are indeed<br/>&gt; producing polyphonic pieces, and some use neutral third sonorities of<br/>&gt; various kinds. However, correcting anyone&apos;s misimpressions as to these<br/>&gt; points should hardly cause the kind of stir which has resulted.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; What are the real issues, not necessarily or solely factual, in<br/>&gt; question? Well, my own position could be summed up about like this:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;      (1) Medieval Islamic theorists describe tetrachords and modes<br/>&gt;          which are beautiful and can and should be applied to medieval<br/>&gt;          and modern maqamat at least some of the time in some contexts;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;      (2) Some of these tunings are closely approximated by current<br/>&gt;          tunings in practical use in various parts of the Near East;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;      (3) Just ratios both simple and complex, as well as values in<br/>&gt;          cents, commas, savarts, etc., can be useful in describing and<br/>&gt;          analyzing current Near Eastern practice; and<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;      (4) Superparticular or other divisions of the medieval theorists,<br/>&gt;          as well as some modern variations, can nicely evoke the state<br/>&gt;          of _tarab_ (&quot;enchantment&quot; or &quot;ecstasy&quot;) sought by performances<br/>&gt;          and audiences as an aspect of the maqam tradition.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Carl, please correct me if I am wrong in seeing your main points as<br/>&gt; follows:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;      (1) You observe that a 24-EDO model can nicely fit some maqam<br/>&gt;          perforamnces.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;      (2) You regard medieval Islamic theory, and likewise the<br/>&gt;          theory of  Ptolemy, insofar as it involves superparticular<br/>&gt;          or other rational ratios of medium to high complexity, as<br/>&gt;          having little reference to either the practice of those<br/>&gt;          times or of today -- doubtless allowing an exception for<br/>&gt;          those of us who deliberately study and then set out to<br/>&gt;          implement these tunings.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;      (3) You associate concepts such as &quot;11-limit&quot; with a<br/>&gt;          harmonic context where various prime factors are in<br/>&gt;          operation (e.g. 2-3-5-7-11, or possibly 2-3-7-11),<br/>&gt;          rather than simply a melodic system using ratios such<br/>&gt;          as 12:11. If we change &quot;JI&quot; to &quot;RI&quot; (rational<br/>&gt;          intonation), and speak of &quot;ratios of 11,&quot; then you<br/>&gt;          might be happier.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;      (4) You generally find complex integer ratios more<br/>&gt;          confusing that illuminating, and would really prefer<br/>&gt;          simply to see measurements in cents.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; While even factual matters in this kind of art often involve a degree<br/>&gt; of judgment and opinion, I&apos;ll certainly agree that some Near Eastern<br/>&gt; performances nicely fit 24-EDO, and suspect that any reasonable person<br/>&gt; would agree that some modern tunings of tetrachords and modes nicely<br/>&gt; fit rational medieval models, or can be seen as variations closer to<br/>&gt; those models than to 24-EDO, for example.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Other than that, it&apos;s mostly taste, artistic perceptions, and<br/>&gt; opinions.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Ozan, please let me also give examples of a few of your insights,<br/>&gt; sometimes the collective insights or you and your colleagues,<br/>&gt; including Can Akkoc, in the paper &quot;Weighing Diverse<br/>&gt; Theoretical Models on Turkish _Maqam_ Music Against Pitch<br/>&gt; Measurements: A Comparison of Peaks Automatically Derived from<br/>&gt; Frequency Histograms with Proposed Scale Tones&quot;:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;       (1) The AEU or mostly Pythagorean model (often featuring<br/>&gt;           schismatic 5-limit approximations) for modern Turkish music<br/>&gt;           actuals fits some flavors of perforance in maqamat such as<br/>&gt;           Rast and Segah, but does not represent important flavors such<br/>&gt;           as Rast with rast-segah at around 16 commas or in the<br/>&gt;           neighborhood of 360 cents (e.g. 16/13), and fails radically<br/>&gt;           to account for prevailing intonational style in maqamat such<br/>&gt;           as Ushshaq and Huseyni.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;       (2) As shown in the earlier work of Akkoc, flexible-pitch<br/>&gt;           performers tend to focus on regions or &quot;clusters&quot; for a given<br/>&gt;           perde or step in a given maqam: for example, evidently,<br/>&gt;           peak areas around either 360 cents or so (16/13) or 380 cents<br/>&gt;           (5/4) for perde segah in Maqam Rast.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;       (3) In Maqam Ushshaq, the second step above the final peaks<br/>&gt;           around 130-140 cents (with 129.7 and 142.2 cents as the<br/>&gt;           autopeak envelop and average, dare I say ~14/13 and ~13/12),<br/>&gt;           in contrast to the 8 commas or 180 cents specified by AEU.<br/>&gt;           Interestingly, however, the neutral sixth when it occurs as<br/>&gt;           an alternative to the minor sixth is much higher, peaking by<br/>&gt;           either measure at around 872 cents. (Scott Marcus reports a<br/>&gt;           similar distinction in Maqam Bayyati (generally corresponding<br/>&gt;           to Turkish Ushshaq) in informed Egyptian practice, where the<br/>&gt;           neutral second step is around 5-15 cents lower than the<br/>&gt;           24-EDO value of 150 cents, but the neutral sixth somewhat<br/>&gt;           _higher_ than 850 cents.)<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;       (4) In Maqam Hijaz, the autopeak envelope for the second step is<br/>&gt;           around 105 cents and the autopeak average around 120 cents,<br/>&gt;           while the major third step peaks at around 380-385 cents,<br/>&gt;           just below 5/4. The AEU formula of 5-12-5 commas (around<br/>&gt;           113-272-113 cents) thus fits the data rather nicely, while my<br/>&gt;           favorite tunings for Hijaz are notably off. For example,<br/>&gt;           while Qutb al-Din al-Shirazi&apos;s 150-267-81 cents is one of my<br/>&gt;           most commonly used models, closely approximated in most of my<br/>&gt;           favorite maqam keyboard tunings, as a representation of modern<br/>&gt;           Turkish practice it is &quot;Not close, and no cigar,&quot; as you<br/>&gt;           might say.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Thus while some facts seem fairly clear, about 90% of this &quot;debate&quot;<br/>&gt; involves opinion, taste (musical and/or theoretical), choice of<br/>&gt; emphasis in the selection of materials, and also differences in<br/>&gt; musical orientation.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Carl, what I mean by &quot;differences in musical orientation&quot; might be<br/>&gt; illustrated by your response to a piece of Elizabethan music, _Come,<br/>&gt; Sirrah Jack, Ho!_ by Thomas Weelkes. From your post, I might guess<br/>&gt; that you are more oriented to 18th-19th century tonality, and are<br/>&gt; experiencing this composition from around 1600 from that perspective.<br/>&gt; From my perspective, when listening to 18th century music, I tend to<br/>&gt; look for moments that could be heard as evoking a familiar<br/>&gt; 16th-century modal context. Either viewpoint is equally real for<br/>&gt; the person experiencing it, although curious to someone more<br/>&gt; attuned to the other period.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; The same music can, and should, evoke different experiences in<br/>&gt; different people. For you, as I read your account, there was an<br/>&gt; interesting contrast between features that might fit an 18th-century<br/>&gt; framework and those diverging from such a framework. When I heard the<br/>&gt; piece for the first time around 1976, I&apos;d guess, on an album of the<br/>&gt; King&apos;s Singers, it sounded to me routinely pleasant, without anything<br/>&gt; standing out. This might simply show that we have internalized<br/>&gt; different musical expectations in certain contexts. And that is fine!<br/>&gt; Your analysis fits the theory I&apos;ve been exposed to over the years:<br/>&gt; certain kinds of degree inflections or fluctuations I tend to take for<br/>&gt; granted, and indeed to cultivate when I&apos;m composing or improvising in<br/>&gt; a Manneristic meantone style, are often noted by modern writers as<br/>&gt; notable or unexpected from a tonal perspective.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;      &lt;<a href="http://www.bestII.com/~mschulter/IntradaFLydian.mp3">http://www.bestII.com/~mschulter/IntradaFLydian.mp3</a>&gt;<br/>&gt;      &lt;<a href="http://www.bestII.com/~mschulter/IntradaFLydian.pdf">http://www.bestII.com/~mschulter/IntradaFLydian.pdf</a>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Anyway, I&apos;m wondering how this discussion of maqam music became a<br/>&gt; &quot;debate,&quot; much less a &quot;debunking,&quot; when the people on various sides<br/>&gt; are mainly making assertions of taste or opinion, which we know &quot;are<br/>&gt; not to be disputed&quot;; when there are some empirical facts to support<br/>&gt; the style of tuning that each party is focusing on or offering<br/>&gt; examples of; and when we know that Near Eastern tunings are, in fact,<br/>&gt; incredibly diverse.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Agreeing affably to disagree, and continuing constructively with<br/>&gt; musicmaking and supportive discussions -- whether in maqam/dastgah<br/>&gt; styles or others -- would seem to me the best resolution of this<br/>&gt; unfortunate episode, for you, Carl and Ozan, for me, and for us<br/>&gt; all who share this friendly and quirky virtual space.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Best,<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Margo<br/>&gt;</p></div><h3><a id=94074 href="#94074">ðŸ”—</a>robert_inventor5 &#x3C;robertwalker@...&#x3E;</h3><span>11/2/2010 4:38:35 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Hi Carl, Cameron, Ozan, etc.</p><p>Just a thought, don&apos;t know if it will help.</p><p>The issue seems to be that some instrumentalists think they can feel high ratio intervals which according to theory don&apos;t seem to be intervals it would be possible to hear as special in any way from nearby intervals just a fraction of a cent away.</p><p>Well the thing I&apos;ve observed which may be relevant is - when you listen to two notes played together on an instrument such as stringed instrument rich in harmonics, you get a very complex pattern of not just one set of beats, but often many beating pairs of partials (from the two notes) all sounding simultaneously at many frequencies.</p><p>So - well any ratio between partials up to say 20 or whatever is the number of partials you can hear in each note if you listen for them individually - you may be able to hear the beats between the actual partials for the ratio.</p><p>Beyond that, for something like say 81/64, which you would originally learn by chains of 3/2s probably - but you might get used to something distinctive about the way the beats in the various frequencies interact with each other.

Basically you are listening to a complex polyrhythm in all the beats at all the beating frequencies from the interacting partials in the dyad, and it may well be distinctive sounding even when there is no simple ratio between any of the notes sounded.</p><p>It might help to resolve this and help to explain how instrumentalists may be able to hear something you would expect to be imperceptible.</p><p>Just a thought.

Not a confirmation of the proto theory since while it is just a proto theory there isn&apos;t enough substance to it to confirm it.</p><p>Anyway general message is, science is much more messy than maths, and that untested theories are to be encouraged and - you start with intriguing or unexplained observations - and then get working on proto theories which you refine using more observations - then eventually at some point you feel confident enough to build a fully fledged theory with clear cut experimental consequences which you can then test.</p><p>If the experiment fails - even at that stage, you mightn&apos;t throw away the theory - it is perfectly valid to continue to refine it, and it is a matter of individual judgement whether tweaks to a theory are acceptable, or whether it has got so complex that you are better off starting from scratch with a new theory. So even evaluating whether a theory is correct or not isn&apos;t the black and white thing it is in Maths. E.g. Ptolemy&apos;s epicycles theory did continue to work if you keep adding enough new epicycles - but the ellipses theory was simpler, so much so that it became increasingly hard to uphold the complex Ptolemy approach.</p><p>As for things like Charles Lucy&apos;s theory - well the actual explanations are eccentric. But - his thesis that there is a special healing or therapeutic effect of pi based tunings - that&apos;s hard to disprove. It&apos;s not enough to just say that it is no more than a particular type of meantone which seems to have nothing special about it. Because - there may be other ways of looking at it. It may be part of a proto theory not yet developed which will show something special about pi based tunings.</p><p>You just can&apos;t tell. Not in science. It&apos;s really such a different subject from Maths - well you get a bit of this sort of thing in Maths too when you get to foundational work particularly - or if you look at the process of discovery rather than the methods of confirmation of proofs - but anyway don&apos;t want to go into that right here as this is about tuning which is essentially an area of science rather than pure maths or even applied maths. Fascinating though the connections are with pure Maths, and even though it is perfectly possible to spawn an area of pure Maths from the science and then pursue it on its own as a field of its own (e.g. you could say study of tuning lattices is an area of applied maths, possibly even pure maths at times, inspired by its applications in an area of science).</p><p>Robert</p><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;robert_inventor5&quot; &lt;robertwalker@...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; BTW what I gave wasn&apos;t a theory yet.

And there isn&apos;t just one String Theory either.</p><p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/String_theory#History">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/String_theory#History</a></p><p>It&apos;s certainly valid to criticise the theoretical ideas of Lucy Tuning - e.g. if it is based on the idea that pi enters in because of the spherical nature of sound waves, you can point out, maybe, that chords sound the same when you listen to them from a great distance when the waves incident on the ear are almost exactly flat. He might have an answer to that, I don&apos;t know, or he might need to go away and attempt to refine his theory.</p><p>You can say that you aren&apos;t convinced by it. You can say that in your own personal opinion the theory isn&apos;t worth exploring - but that can only be a personal opinion.</p><p>Also if he makes clear testable predictions, then you can investigate whether those predictions are true or not. If he doesn&apos;t, then you can just discuss ideas. whether they seem interesting to you, what needs to be done to put them on a more scientific basis, that sort of thing, and explain why you think it isn&apos;t yet a theory proper.</p><p>In science, often there will be many proto theories around and some will lead nowhere and be given up by everyone including the original theorists. Some will be just vague ideas that don&apos;t get developed very far.</p><p>Some become a minority idea which only a few scientists hold to, maybe just in one university e.g. Fred Hoyle&apos;s ideas about panspermia and life carried from place to place on comets and evolved in outer space not on a planet.</p><p>Some are just on the fringe of science, to the extent that nowadays few respectable scientists even look at them, such as cold fusion - but not really disproved. One easily repeatable experiment or better still, actual energy generating device, would change the entire nature of the field and make cold fusion once more mainstream.</p><p>And all that is stuff that gets published in physics journals. When you are presented with hard to explain data you may briefly at least think of much more &quot;whacky&quot; ideas, which never get to print, such as e.g. the original ET hypothesis for pulsars - which never got to the stage of even a proto theory, just a very natural thought that passed through the mind of the researcher, enough to mention it to colleagues, but soon dismissed once there were several separate very similar pulsars at widely spread locations in the sky. If we had the modern internet at that time, then the scientists involved might well have discussed that idea briefly in a forum like this :).</p><p>And that&apos;s mainstream science. I think a forum like this should encourage &quot;fringe science&quot; as well since the focus is as much on creativity and music composition and inspiration as it is on the development of tuning theory.</p><p>Fringe science can be interesting and inspiring and lead to new ideas and theories and especially new art works even when it never even reaches the status of a proto theory in scientific sense.</p><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;genewardsmith&quot; &lt;genewardsmith@...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; --- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;robert_inventor5&quot; &lt;robertwalker@&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; Many of them completely untested even.

Ozan may disagree, even strongly, but I suspect that a lot of the ancient and medieval tuning writings might actually assume the tempering out of certain intervals. I imagine that the Pythagorean interval which is two cents from 6:5 might very well have been meant to be 6:5 (there is a reproduction of an old Pythagoren tanbur fretting scheme presenting this interval at Ozan&apos;s site, IIRC).</p><p>The two cents to which you refer is the schisma, and so this is schismatic temperament. When you produce chains of pure fifths of 17 or 24 notes to the octave, you get such things all over the place. Schismatic is a microtemperament, so you don&apos;t need to flatten the fifth by 1/8 or 1/9 or 1/10 or whatever of a schisma to get good results, and you can call the JI tuning a temperament tuning if that&apos;s how it is being used. When I mentioned 171 as a tuning for maqam music, Ozan didn&apos;t go for it, but I think he said it was because it involved too many notes.</p></div><h3><a id=94143 href="#94143">ðŸ”—</a>cityoftheasleep &#x3C;igliashon@...&#x3E;</h3><span>11/3/2010 1:02:50 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;cameron&quot; &lt;misterbobro@...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt; For the individual, or groups strongly sharing feelings by mutual consent?

He certainly didn&apos;t make any assertions that 12-tET explained all of it, or even a lot--just that it explained more than he expected it to.  Those whole-numbers--1, 2, 8, 10, etc.--are 12-tET semitones, and I believe Carl was probably surprised (as am I) to find actual 12-tET semitones cropping up in maqam music alongside ratios and integer fractions of semitones (the decimal numbers).</p><p>&gt; &gt; No one has suggested that people cannot tune a pitch within the same region as<br/>&gt; &gt; ratios of 11, just that specifically the ratios themselves are not responsible for any<br/>&gt; &gt;psychoacoustic attraction (given typical harmonic timbres).<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Really?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; <a href="http://launch.groups.yahoo.com/group/tuning/message/94048">http://launch.groups.yahoo.com/group/tuning/message/94048</a><br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Carl to Margo:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &quot;Generally the point is that ratios (dyads) of 11 are not<br/>&gt; tunable by ear either harmonically or melodically. &quot;</p><p>That is a radically different assertion than saying someone can&apos;t tune a neutral 3rd or neutral 2nd etc. by ear.  We all know that people can and do tune neutral intervals like these by ear all the time, and the only thing anyone has ever debated is the validity of insisting that the intervals being tuned are de-facto ratios of 11 (vs. a fuzzily-defined probability distribution of pitch centered on something like 350 cents or whatever).  So yes, neutral thirds et al--totally tunable by ear.  Just because ratios of 11 are within the probability distribution of these neutral intervals, does that mean they are tunable by ear?</p><p>Igliashon wrote:<br/>&gt; &gt;Personally, I think maxima of harmonic entropy are as easy to tune as minima</p><p>Cameron wrote:<br/>&gt; Could be, I&apos;m very open to that possibility.</p><p>I wonder what Carl thinks...</p><p>&gt; You miss the point: it&apos;s the complex intervals of the ancient and medieval writers which &gt; have been accused of being numerology. I merely point out that there turns out to be far &gt; far less of this alleged &quot;complexity&quot; when you look at the intervals in context and in the &gt; light of fretting methodology. So what happens to the argument that we can disregard an &gt; old text because it is just number magic, when the claim that it is number magic is<br/>&gt; based on a complexity which turns out to be illusory? It sinks.</p><p>But the complexity *isn&apos;t* always illusory.  Ratios of 11, for instance, do not pop out of a simple Pythagorean-esque bearing plan.  In fact, I&apos;d say the whole &quot;bearing-plan based on simple ratios&quot; is more justification for the use of higher-integer-but-lower-prime-limit ratios in ancient tunings than it is for higher-prime-limit-but-lower-integer ratios.  Of course, this assumes fixed-pitch instruments; to suggest that a fretless player or a singer or whatever can follow a bearing-plan of any sort is a little harder to swallow.</p><p>Either way, I really think you&apos;ve misinterpreted Carl&apos;s arguments, and the two of you will get nowhere until you actually understand each other.</p><p>-Igs</p></div><h3><a id=94144 href="#94144">ðŸ”—</a>Ozan Yarman &#x3C;ozanyarman@...&#x3E;</h3><span>11/3/2010 1:07:37 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Gene, what you say has nothing to do with what I said.</p><p>Oz.</p><p>--</p><p>&#x2729; &#x2729; &#x2729;<br/><a href="http://www.ozanyarman.com">www.ozanyarman.com</a></p><p>genewardsmith wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; --- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, Ozan Yarman&lt;ozanyarman@...&gt;  wrote:<br/>&gt;&gt; Has it escaped the attention of everyone that music is a social/cultural<br/>&gt;&gt; artform just like all other art forms and is not necessarily dependant<br/>&gt;&gt; on a set of cold empirical data that comes out of the laboratory?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; An observation which does not in any way support the notion that there some chance a fifth of exactly 600+300/pi cents is much better than other fifths a small fraction of a cent away.

When you produce chains of pure fifths of 17 or 24 notes to the octave, you get such things all over the place. Schismatic is a microtemperament, so you don&apos;t need to flatten the fifth by 1/8 or 1/9 or 1/10 or whatever of a schisma to get good results, and you can call the JI tuning a temperament tuning if that&apos;s how it is being used.

Everything that you&apos;re saying comes out<br/>of the fact that there might be some areas of acoustics that you<br/>haven&apos;t studied. If you were to delve into it a bit, you would<br/>probably realize why some of the things that folks around here think<br/>are silly are silly. At least learn the theory first so you can throw<br/>it away later or extend it.</p><p>I don&apos;t think that there are any 7-tet &quot;acoustics conflicts.&quot; I think<br/>that there is a long-standing source of disagreement on this list<br/>about the exact resolution of the ear-brain temporal analysis system,<br/>and how it can resolve harmonics and how strong the VF system is.</p><p>Some people tend to think that this resolution is more on the high<br/>side (Cameron), some think it&apos;s more on the low side (Carl). There are<br/>some who think it&apos;s on the super-high side (the JI folks) and some who<br/>think it&apos;s on the super-low side (me, kind of). There are a lot of<br/>people in between.</p><p>There is then a second disagreement about how much the brain can adapt<br/>given repeated exposure to &quot;discordant&quot; dyads to eventually resolve<br/>the VF. Some tend to think that the brain&apos;s adaptive capacity is high<br/>in this regard (Cameron), some tend to think that it&apos;s lower (I think<br/>this is where Carl stands). I&apos;m somewhere in the middle. In general<br/>this is a disagreement about how cognitive factors (such as learning)<br/>and hard-wired psychoacoustical factors interact.</p><p>There is then a third disagreement about how dyadic analysis extends<br/>to triadic analysis, and everyone seems to be all over the place with<br/>that. I tend to be more on the extreme side in that I think that the<br/>brain&apos;s ability to resolve triads is much less than its ability to<br/>resolve dyads. That is, I don&apos;t think that there&apos;s any point in<br/>calling something 10:12:15 unless it&apos;s actually perceived as pointing<br/>to 1, just like I don&apos;t think that there&apos;s any point in calling<br/>something 501:400 unless it&apos;s actually pointing to 1 - otherwise it&apos;s<br/>a mistuned 5/4.</p><p>I also think a fourth disagreement is emerging, and one that I&apos;m not<br/>entirely sure that people are aware they&apos;re engaged in, that has to do<br/>with what it means to &quot;place&quot; a JI dyad/triad/whatever. For example,<br/>there are generally two things that happen when a JI dyad is played -<br/>some kind of virtual fundamental starts to pop out, and the partials<br/>that are close enough to beat end up beating in some kind of recurring<br/>polyrhythm with one another (&quot;periodicity buzz&quot;). I&apos;m not sure I fully<br/>understand all of the psychoacoustic mechanisms behind the latter.</p><p>But when some people refer to &quot;placing&quot; or &quot;being able to identify&quot; a<br/>chunk of the harmonic series, they&apos;re referring to the VF part of it<br/>(Carl) and then other people use the same terminology to refer to the<br/>periodicity buzz aspect of it (I think this is what Cameron&apos;s doing).<br/>The two are generally lumped together but I&apos;m not entirely sure that<br/>this is the right way to go.</p><p>I also think that the recognition of different periodicity buzz<br/>&quot;imprints&quot; is something that&apos;s more easily influenced by learning than<br/>the VF aspect of it, but I could be wrong.</p><p>The point is that these are all things where there&apos;s not like a wealth<br/>of research, so there&apos;s lots of disagreements about it. I have some of<br/>my own ideas that are rather extreme compared to the status quo around<br/>here. But none of this has to do with &quot;basic acoustics&quot; and 7-tet is<br/>not in conflict with any of that.</p><p>&gt; &nbsp; &nbsp; And in the case such a test proved people consistantly did not favor Lucytuning , that would put a &quot;publically-voted&quot; final nail in the coffin and likely hint to the previously mentioned suspicion that Lucytuning is indeed more an example of good promotion and/or advertising boosting the appearance of a theory than anything musically useful.</p><p>No. Even if Lucytuning sounds great, that still wouldn&apos;t say anything<br/>about the underlying theory behind it.</p><p>-Mike</p></div><h3><a id=94163 href="#94163">ðŸ”—</a>cameron &#x3C;misterbobro@...&#x3E;</h3><span>11/3/2010 3:21:12 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;cityoftheasleep&quot; &lt;igliashon@...&gt; wrote:<br/>.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Oh come on, you&apos;ve said yourself several times that minor can sound happy and major can sound sad and vice versa, even to you.

He certainly didn&apos;t make any assertions that 12-tET explained all of it, or even a lot--just that it explained more than he expected it to.  Those whole-numbers--1, 2, 8, 10, etc.--are 12-tET semitones, and I believe Carl was probably surprised (as am I) to find actual 12-tET semitones cropping up in maqam music alongside ratios and integer fractions of semitones (the decimal numbers).</p><p>Even the whole tones and semitones aren&apos;t explained by 12-tET. They should come as zero suprise to anyone familiar with even the basics<br/>tuning in the Near East- they are the tones and semitones of Pythagorean tuning. 9:8 and the limma, documented for thousands of years. Although I find that he goes off in a strange direction (I  doubt he&apos;s a practicing musician), Farhat is a very thoughtful author on Persian music, and full of well-done information you can interpret yourself. I agree with him on calling tones and limmas tones and limmas. :-)<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; No one has suggested that people cannot tune a pitch within the same region as<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; ratios of 11, just that specifically the ratios themselves are not responsible for any<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt;psychoacoustic attraction (given typical harmonic timbres).<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; Really?<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; <a href="http://launch.groups.yahoo.com/group/tuning/message/94048">http://launch.groups.yahoo.com/group/tuning/message/94048</a><br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; Carl to Margo:<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &quot;Generally the point is that ratios (dyads) of 11 are not<br/>&gt; &gt; tunable by ear either harmonically or melodically. &quot;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; That is a radically different assertion than saying someone can&apos;t &gt;tune a neutral 3rd or neutral 2nd etc. by ear.  We all know that &gt;people can and do tune neutral intervals like these by ear all the &gt;time, and the only thing anyone has ever debated is the validity of &gt;insisting that the intervals being tuned are de-facto ratios of 11 &gt;&gt;(vs. a fuzzily-defined probability distribution of pitch centered on &gt;something like 350 cents or whatever).  So yes, neutral thirds et al-&gt;-totally tunable by ear.  Just because ratios of 11 are within the &gt;probability distribution of these neutral intervals, does that mean &gt;they are tunable by ear?</p><p>As I said, you can throw whatever number magic you like around, it&apos;s not going to change reality.

For example, yes, I&apos;ve<br/>heard about the Basilar Membrane, and frequency masking along it long before you<br/>mentioned it (and even mentioned these things several times on list).  No, I<br/>have never considered the pattern as a &quot;circle&quot; the way you have or thought of<br/>it as something Charles Lucy might have been confused by and built mis-claims<br/>around...but that certainly doesn&apos;t mean I don&apos;t know it.  In fact I remember<br/>you asking me about a month ago on tuning research &quot;what do you mean by<br/>frequency masking?&quot; when you asked about why noise waves don&apos;t sound as<br/>dissonant as they &quot;should&quot;.<br/>   And if you&apos;re going to make huge generalizing statements against me, at least<br/>give specific examples so I get a fair chance to say what I do know.</p><p>&gt;&quot;If you were to delve into it a bit, you would probably realize why some of the<br/>&gt;things that folks around here think are silly are silly.&quot;</p><p>    I don&apos;t think what Charles was claiming is &quot;not silly&quot;...I just don&apos;t get<br/>how you can attack his claim when all the knowledge you seem to have to know<br/>&quot;what he meant&quot; appears nothing more than a guess.  Granted, his website is<br/>pretty vague about his theories.  Furthermore, again, even if he did, say, mean<br/>to tie Lucytuning to frequency masking (which obviously does not work)...who<br/>cares (it doesn&apos;t, alone, mean it sounds bad)?</p><p>&gt;&quot;I don&apos;t think that there are any 7-tet &quot;acoustics conflicts.&quot; I think that<br/>&gt;there is a long-standing source of disagreement on this list about the exact<br/>&gt;resolution of the ear-brain temporal analysis system, and how it can resolve<br/>&gt;harmonics and how strong the VF system is.&quot;</p><p>   In that case, what surprises me is that it seems to imply either the VF<br/>system is not what defines a lot of the sense of &quot;rootedness&quot; in 7TET or that<br/>the system can work differently than it was originally thought to.  I still<br/>don&apos;t see why you thing Lucytuning is any more &quot;acoustically conflicting&quot; than<br/>7TET...unless you are rating it by its ability to mirror the activity of<br/>ascending frequency masking (something you seem to assume but I&apos;ve never heard<br/>Charles say IE &quot;by 3D and PI I mean the curve of frequency masking in the<br/>Basilar Membrane&quot;).</p><p>&gt;&quot;some who think it&apos;s on the super-low side (me, kind of)&quot;</p><p>     Super low side meaning...there are whole lot of frequencies between things<br/>like low-limit JI ratios that act as weak versions of those ratios and imply<br/>similar virtual root tones?</p><p>&gt;&quot;I tend to be more on the extreme side in that I think that the brain&apos;s ability<br/>&gt;to resolve triads is much less than its ability to resolve dyads.&quot;<br/>  Agreed, in fact the larger the chord, the less notes seem to matter and the<br/>less obvious the root to me.</p><p>&gt;&quot;the partials that are close enough to beat end up beating in some kind of<br/>&gt;recurring<br/>polyrhythm with one another (&quot;periodicity buzz&quot;)&quot;</p><p>Now this really makes me wonder: I understand periodicity buzz as simply equal<br/>difference tones IE 300hz 400hz 500hz has a constant 100hz periodicity buzz.<br/>I&apos;m guessing the idea revolves around that the oscillation generated by<br/>periodicity buzz itself begins to act as the prominent Virtual Fundamental?.</p><p>&gt;&quot;No. Even if Lucytuning sounds great, that still wouldn&apos;t say anything about the<br/>&gt;underlying theory behind it.&quot;<br/>    Never said it would...but I did say (and will say again) that if that did<br/>happen, it might get people thinking seriously about finding out what makes it<br/>click.  And I agree: Charles&apos;s reasons why it supposedly worse seem vague and<br/>unprovable via acoustics (at least in the detail he describes them in)...but<br/>that doesn&apos;t necessarily mean other people can&apos;t find a better reason why<br/>Lucytuning works.<br/>    And again, if such a test fails...nothing more to be said and a whole lot of<br/>theorists will continue not taking Lucytuning seriously...end of story.</p></div><h3><a id=94184 href="#94184">ðŸ”—</a>Michael &#x3C;djtrancendance@...&#x3E;</h3><span>11/3/2010 5:59:02 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Cameron&gt;&quot;What magic property do you propose is it that makes me tune to within a<br/>couple of cents of 11:9 and 11:8 over and over again, even sometimes when that<br/>is NOT exactly where I&apos;m aiming for?

It&apos;s so easy for me to have &quot;unspoken&quot;<br/>understandings about the meaning of my own words not so obvious<br/>to anyone else.</p><p>And I should briefly mention a couple of my technical<br/>limitations: I have no means to access or hear videos, or to do<br/>measurements of frequencies or intervals in cents for a maqam<br/>performance, say. But I&apos;m immensely interested in what you, Ozan,<br/>Cameron, Jacques, or others might find.</p><p>&gt;&gt; What are the real issues, not necessarily or solely factual,<br/>&gt;&gt; in question? Well, my own position could be summed up about<br/>&gt;&gt; like this:<br/>&gt;&gt;      (1) Medieval Islamic theorists describe tetrachords and<br/>&gt;&gt; modes which are beautiful and can and should be applied to<br/>&gt;&gt; medieval and modern maqamat at least some of the time in some<br/>&gt;&gt; contexts;</p><p>&gt; ...Don&apos;t see how anyone could disagree with this.</p><p>And actually this is about 70% of my point, with a helpful<br/>footnote that I do some rather un-medieval things in my maqam<br/>tunings, with temperament at the top of the list, and the<br/>11:12:13 division (as far as I know) as another.</p><p>What both Ozan and I do, in different ways, is to take some<br/>leaves from the medieval book and modify them a bit, or at least<br/>mix in some new ingredients. And for both of us, temperament is<br/>one of those ingredients. The different ways it&apos;s used in his<br/>79/80-MOS or my much more modest O3 could be an interesting topic<br/>of comparison.</p><p>&gt;&gt;      (2) Some of these tunings are closely approximated by<br/>&gt;&gt; current tunings in practical use in various parts of<br/>&gt;&gt; the Near East;</p><p>&gt; Seems likely, though the word &quot;closely&quot; can be troublesome.<br/>&gt; The central point I would stress is that we really don&apos;t have<br/>&gt; much idea what tunings are currently in use, because of a<br/>&gt; paucity of data.  That ought to lead to some humility, which<br/>&gt; would be good for all of us.</p><p>What I would predict is that there are far too many variations to<br/>fall neatly into _any_ model, medieval or later, which<br/>recognition may be at least the beginning of humility. Looking at<br/>some measurements of Iranian tunings by Nelly Caron and Dariush<br/>Safvate, and others by Jean During, as well as Hormoz Farhat&apos;s<br/>book, I find this variety an inspiration for anyone contemplating<br/>the infinite shadings possible, and of course a daunting obstacle<br/>for anyone who wants a single &quot;master tuning&quot; of any practical<br/>size for a typical acoustical fixed-pitch instrument, as you<br/>suggest below and I agree.</p><p>And I see integer ratios as signposts or street numbers, not as<br/>points of unique validity somehow devaluing the territory in<br/>between those signposts. This brings us to a vital point which I<br/>find it prudent to explain before posting summaries of measured<br/>flexible-pitch tunings or instrumental frettings, etc.</p><p>An observation of more or less &quot;close&quot; resemblance could lend<br/>itself to any of at least three viewpoints:</p><p>        VIEWPOINT I: &quot;Isn&apos;t it wonderful how medieval tunings<br/>        describe interval sizes and shadings close to those of<br/>        some tunings used on fixed-pitch instruments or by<br/>        flexible-pitch performers today?&quot; Here there&apos;s no claim<br/>        that the rational values are uniquely salient or<br/>        &quot;attractant,&quot; only a focus on regions or &quot;neighborhoods&quot;<br/>        of the spectrum, leaving open the question of possible<br/>        further connections or their lack.</p><p>        VIEWPOINT 2: &quot;The fact that one or more medieval<br/>        theorists describes this rational tetrachord, and this<br/>        modern instrument or performance uses or closely<br/>        approximates it, indicates that the rational ratios<br/>        themselves, not just the general neighborhood or shading,<br/>        have some special salience or attractive power.&quot;</p><p>        VIEWPOINT 3: &quot;The correspondence between the medieval<br/>        ratios and the modern tuning on a fixed-pitch instrument<br/>        shows some common tradition or acoustical logic of the<br/>        process of building and playing instruments of the<br/>        relevant type.&quot;</p><p>My own position is to assert Viewpoint 1 and remain open to<br/>evidence one way or the other on Viewpoints 2 and 3, the kinds of<br/>issues raised by Ozan, Cris, and Cameron. Note that my practice<br/>of using certain superparticular or other rational ratios as<br/>intellectually attractive signposts or landmarks in itself<br/>neither affirms nor denies that they may additionally have an<br/>aurally attractive pull for musicians brought up in these<br/>traditions, or a special significance in the vocabulary and<br/>grammar of instrument building, if I may call it that, as a<br/>variation on Cris&apos;s etymology of numbers and ratios.</p><p>And I must admit that the psychoacoustical theories I would find<br/>most plausible would be those either developed by dastgah and<br/>maqam musicians or at least based on culturally specific<br/>observations of talented performers or listeners brought up in<br/>these traditions who have a native phonology, so to speak.<br/>Objective tests of the ability of people practicing maqam or<br/>dastgah music as a first language to discriminate between shades<br/>of neutral intervals or degrees of contrast between smaller and<br/>larger neutral seconds, for example, might be very interesting.</p><p>Further, I find in the Islamic theorists of the Mutazilah Era a<br/>logically attractive lore or discipline focusing on the<br/>gradations and relations of rational ratios, an outlook also<br/>reflected in some portions of _Divisions of the Tetrachord_ by<br/>John Chalmers, that can be embraced while affirming the value of<br/>irrational ratios and divisions also (which John addresses at<br/>length), and leaving open psychoacoustical issues that might not<br/>much affect my artistic outlook, although new knowledge can<br/>always enrich one&apos;s perspective.</p><p>Having said that, I would emphasize that it&apos;s possible to see<br/>resemblances between a medieval rational tuning and a current<br/>intonational practice without necessarily saying that the<br/>specific medieval ratios are precisely represented in, or<br/>&quot;explain,&quot; the modern performance.</p><p>First, let&apos;s consider the oldest description known to me of the<br/>tetrachord that would later be called Rast, al-Farabi&apos;s mode of<br/>Zalzal:</p><p>       1/1    9/8    27/22   4/3<br/>        0     204     355    498<br/>          9:8    12:11   88:81<br/>          204     151     143</p><p>Now consider Amine Beyhom&apos;s estimate (thesis, Vol. I, at p. 52)<br/>of a typical Lebanese Rast in a &quot;learned&quot; (_savant_) style:</p><p>        0     200    355    500<br/>          200     155    145</p><p>When I say that either tuning is &quot;closely approximated&quot; by the<br/>other, I mean simply that they represent similar shades of what<br/>has come to be called Rast. What I&apos;d note is not only the similar<br/>sizes of the neutral thirds, but the subtle difference (around<br/>8-10 cents) between the larger and smaller neutral seconds.</p><p>I do not mean to imply that the second tuning is intentionally or<br/>otherwise based on rational ratios, although we might asssociate<br/>200 cents with 9:8. But it&apos;s the similar degree of subtle<br/>difference between the two neutral seconds, with the larger<br/>placed first, that catches my attention.</p><p>To make my disclaimer more emphatic here, let&apos;s consider a<br/>tetrachord that Beyhom measured from a performance in Hijaz by<br/>the Turkish master Kudsi Erguner</p><p>&lt;<a href="http://www.beyhom.com/download/articles/Beyhom_2007_%20Des_criteres_d_authenticite_filigrane_n5.pdf">http://www.beyhom.com/download/articles/Beyhom_2007_%20Des_criteres_d_authenticite_filigrane_n5.pdf</a>&gt;:</p><p>       0     131     368      501<br/>         131     237      133</p><p>Now I might excitedly, as a self-appointed referee, call &quot;Buzurg&quot;<br/>and cite two possible tetrachords using the ratios specified for<br/>this mode (or actually the lower tetrachord of their pentachordal<br/>schemes) by Safi al-Din al-Urmawi and Qutb al-Din al-Shirazi:</p><p>      1/1    14/13     16/13    4/3<br/>       0      128       359     498<br/>         14:13     8:7     13:12<br/>          128      231      139</p><p>                    or</p><p>      1/1    13/12     26/21    4/3<br/>       0      139       370     498<br/>         13:12     8:7     14:13<br/>          128      231      139</p><p>Indeed Erguner&apos;s tetrachord resembles these in having a small<br/>neutral second, a middle step close to 8:7 (actually a bit<br/>bigger), and another smallish neutral second. Noting this<br/>pleasant kinship, however, isn&apos;t to say that Erguner is following<br/>any rational scheme, or is making a distinction between 14:13 and<br/>13:12.</p><p>While I can and will celebrate this as an example of a<br/>&quot;Buzurg-type Hijaz,&quot; in fact if we are seeking a &quot;close fit,&quot;<br/>36-EDO or 46-EDO would be closer than either rational version of<br/>Buzurg above:</p><p> Erguner:      0      131      368      501<br/>                  131      237     133</p><p> 36-EDO:       0      133      367      500<br/>                  133      233     133</p><p> 46-EDO        0      130      365      496<br/>                  130      235     130</p><p>And I would certainly not conclude from Erguner&apos;s performance<br/>that &quot;a Turkish Hijaz of the Buzurg flavor is based on 36-EDO&quot; --<br/>or 46-EDO, for that matter!</p><p>Actually, modern Turkish or Syrian theory based on 53 commas<br/>might capture my general category of &quot;Buzurg&quot; as 6-10-6, or here,<br/>using a suggested refinement of Beyhom for models based on 17 or<br/>24 positions per octave, &quot;6- 10+ 6-&quot; to show that each neutral<br/>second is a bit smaller than 6 commas (about 135 cents) while the<br/>middle step is a bit larger than 10 commas (about 226-228 cents)<br/>or even a full 8:7 at 231 cents.</p><p>In some cases, we might be able to draw some kind of<br/>&quot;etymological&quot; connection, as Cris Forster has put it, or to draw<br/>some connection between a given fretting scheme and a medieval<br/>theoretical tradition, as Cameron has proposed. But noting<br/>and celebrating some interesting resemblances need not itself<br/>imply either type of connection.</p><p>Generally my point in citing and comparing medieval rational<br/>tunings and more or less kindred modern intonations is to<br/>illustrate the variety of Near Eastern tetrachords and shadings,<br/>historical and current.</p><p>&gt; However we can say certain things are unlikely.  For instance,<br/>&gt; choose a rational number R at random, num(R)*den(R) &lt; 10,000<br/>&gt; and 1 &lt; R &lt; 2.  Let&apos;s say 55/27.  What are the odds it is used<br/>&gt; systematically in maqam music (that is, it is the target of<br/>&gt; some bearing plan, fret placement instruction, vocal training<br/>&gt; regimen, etc, used by more than one musician... that<br/>&gt; musicians/craftsmen have some means of communicating about it,<br/>&gt; not necessarily by name, but in *some* fashion)?  Answer: the<br/>&gt; odds are low and we wouldn&apos;t believe this unless evidence was<br/>&gt; plainly extant, de novo, of such a bearing plan, fret placement<br/>&gt; instruction, etc. etc.</p><p>That&apos;s a curious illustration; we&apos;re talking about roughly 1232<br/>cents (55/27).</p><p>What&apos;s likely, or relevant, may depend on the question and on<br/>one&apos;s viewpoint. To describe an interval around 370 cents, as on<br/>Cameron&apos;s baglama or in my tempered vrsion of a flavor of Turkish<br/>Rast, by association with the rational signpost of 26/21, or a<br/>4/3 less a 14/13, is what some of us find an intuitively<br/>appealing mapping. And, likewise, an interval in this immediate<br/>neighborhood might be associated with 99/80, or 9/8 plus 11/10, a<br/>ratio of around 369 cents occurring in the &quot;Medium Sundered&quot;<br/>tetrachord of Safi al-Din (9:8-11:10-320:297 or 204-165-129<br/>cents).</p><p>These conceptual landmarks are useful to some of us -- not<br/>necessarily all of us, as you&apos;ve made clear! -- in themselves.<br/>Whether fretting schemes might favor these superparticular<br/>patterns more than nearby but distinguishable shadings, and<br/>whether flexible-pitch performers might be especially drawn to<br/>them, are open questions.</p><p>&gt;&gt;      (3) Just ratios both simple and complex, as well as values<br/>&gt;&gt; in cents, commas, savarts, etc., can be useful in describing<br/>&gt;&gt; and analyzing current Near Eastern practice; and</p><p>&gt; I would dispute this beyond the 7-limit.  Within the 7-limit<br/>&gt; it&apos;s unclear, but plausible, and Weighing Diverse seems to<br/>&gt; support it.</p><p>Note that my &quot;useful&quot; may have a minimalistic sense that<br/>rationals can provide an intuitively appealing grid (in the eye<br/>of the beholder!) for mapping and appreciating the continuum of<br/>neutral or Zalzalian seconds or thirds, for example. Such a grid<br/>may or may not itself mark points of salient aural attraction, as<br/>likewise with a grid such as 17-EDO, 24-EDO, or 53-EDO (all of<br/>which have been proposed or used by Near Eastern theorists).</p><p>&gt;&gt;      (4) Superparticular or other divisions of the medieval<br/>&gt;&gt; theorists, as well as some modern variations, can nicely evoke<br/>&gt;&gt; the state of _tarab_ (&quot;enchantment&quot; or &quot;ecstasy&quot;) sought by<br/>&gt;&gt; performances and audiences as an aspect of the maqam<br/>&gt;&gt; tradition.</p><p>&gt; I&apos;m not sure how to evaluate this.  Beyond the 7-limit I know<br/>&gt; of no property of superparticular intervals that makes them<br/>&gt; special in a melodic context, and even within the 7-limit<br/>&gt; harmonic context, intervals such as 5:3 and 7:4 are on par with<br/>&gt; superparticulars in terms of their stand-out psychoacoustic<br/>&gt; properties.</p><p>An ambiguity of my quoted proposition (4), which I&apos;ll clarify<br/>now, is whether it means &quot;superparticular and other medieval<br/>divisions alone or especially&quot; or &quot;medieval rational divisions,<br/>among many others.&quot; My intended reading is totally nonexclusive,<br/>and thanks for a chance to say so. In other words, &quot;12:13:14 or<br/>128-139 cents is beautiful, and 125-137.5 cents in 96-EDO, or<br/>133.3-133.3 cents in 36-EDO or 63-EDO, might be comparably so.&quot;</p><p>Whether superparticular divisions such as 12:13:14 or 14:13:12<br/>and 11:12:13 or 13:12:11 have additionally have a special aural<br/>attraction for expert or other performers growing up in a maqam<br/>or dastgah tradition is an empirical question. And I find Cris&apos;s<br/>instrumental etymology, which I&apos;ll need his book to study in more<br/>detail, quite credible. While Ozan and I have independently been<br/>drawn to the 13:12:11 or 11:12:13 division for certain maqamat or<br/>dastgah-ha, let me prudently note again that I&apos;m not aware of any<br/>medieval sources citing this division.</p><p>Also, I don&apos;t know if anyone is claiming that superparticulars<br/>and only superparticulars are aurally salient: those of us drawn<br/>to JI/RI have been citing ratios like 13/11, 14/11, and 26/21,<br/>and certainly would recognize 7/4 as well as 16/9 as significant<br/>landmarks. And likewise with 11/9, which Cameron found a clear<br/>aural attractant in certain instrumental timbres (his Spectral<br/>Harmonic Entropy or SHE).</p><p>&gt;&gt; Carl, please correct me if I am wrong in seeing your main<br/>&gt;&gt; points as follows:</p><p>&gt;&gt; (1) You observe that a 24-EDO model can nicely fit some maqam<br/>&gt;&gt; perforamnces.</p><p>&gt; Yes.</p><p>And I&apos;d add that Near Eastern theorists such as Vaziri in Iran<br/>have endorsed 24-EDO. I consider it as one point on a continuum.</p><p>&gt;&gt;      (2) You regard medieval Islamic theory, and likewise the<br/>&gt;&gt;      theory of Ptolemy, insofar as it involves superparticular<br/>&gt;&gt;      or other rational ratios of medium to high complexity, as<br/>&gt;&gt;      having little reference to either the practice of those<br/>&gt;&gt;      times or of today -- doubtless allowing an exception for<br/>&gt;&gt;      those of us who deliberately study and then set out to<br/>&gt;&gt;      implement these tunings.</p><p>&gt; I know of no evidence they&apos;re connected.</p><p>This I see as an open question, which Cris and Cameron may<br/>address further, and the former addresses in detail in his new<br/>book. My own artistic program, which no one else is obliged to<br/>follow (and much less any or all Near Eastern musicians!),<br/>wouldn&apos;t depend on the answer.</p><p>&gt; I know of strong evidence these theorists would have had no<br/>&gt; alternative but to use rational numbers to express their<br/>&gt; scales.</p><p>This is a point that Owen Wright also makes. Cris has commented<br/>that an &quot;equable&quot; division like Ibn Sina&apos;s 14;13:12 or 12:13:14<br/>is the way of indicating a 7:6 third derived from two near-equal<br/>steps. While I may like the subtle distinction between 14:13 and<br/>13:12, this doesn&apos;t mean a geometric division as in 36-EDO or<br/>63-EDO would be &quot;wrong,&quot; or an unequal division like 130-143<br/>cents not necessarily having any clear rational interpretation<br/>(I&apos;m just pulling numbers out of the air for my last example).<br/>One theorist around the 15th or 16th century, as I recall, found<br/>Ibn Sina&apos;s 12:13:14:16 (139-128-231 cents) or 28:26:24:21<br/>(128-139-231 cents) less than satisfactory because the two<br/>neutral second steps are too close to identical!</p><p>Whether Near Eastern musicians are aurally drawn, or drawn by<br/>instrument designs, to superparticular divisions vis-a-vis<br/>comparably shaded geometric or unequal but not rationally<br/>conceived divisions is an open question, and I&apos;m open to a range<br/>of results, interpretations, and answers.</p><p>[On deliberate modern tuning according to medieval ratios]</p><p>&gt; Of course I allow that exception.</p><p>And that exception is all I really need.</p><p>&gt;&gt;     (3) You associate concepts such as &quot;11-limit&quot; with a<br/>&gt;&gt;         harmonic context where various prime factors are in<br/>&gt;&gt;         operation (e.g. 2-3-5-7-11, or possibly 2-3-7-11),<br/>&gt;&gt;         rather than simply a melodic system using ratios such<br/>&gt;&gt;         as 12:11. If we change &quot;JI&quot; to &quot;RI&quot; (rational<br/>&gt;&gt;         intonation), and speak of &quot;ratios of 11,&quot; then you<br/>&gt;&gt;         might be happier.</p><p>&gt; Generally the point is that ratios (dyads) of 11 are not<br/>&gt; tunable by ear either harmonically or melodically.  In triads<br/>&gt; like 10:11:12, 4:7:11 and so on, available on dulcimers and the<br/>&gt; like, more can be said of a tendency to gravitate to 11.<br/>&gt; However I have never heard these relationships in recordings,<br/>&gt; and Santoor tuning instructions I have seen have not mentioned<br/>&gt; them.  Now, maybe I should just get out more, which is why I<br/>&gt; keep asking for examples.  I get accused of insincerity, or<br/>&gt; just ignored, when I do this.</p><p>While remaining open to a range of results and conclusions on the<br/>pragmatic question of whether and to what degree melodic<br/>intervals, dyads, or more complex sonorities can be tuned by ear,<br/>I might make two points about intonational politics.</p><p>First, tunability or recognizability or reproducibility by ear<br/>might depend a lot on the cultural background and training of the<br/>musicians involved. And the usefulness of a given arithmetic<br/>division or bearing plan for an instrument, as Cameron and Cris<br/>have discussed, might not depend on whether every interval,<br/>simple or complex, can be directly tuned by ear.</p><p>Secondly, whether or not rational ratios with an intuitive or<br/>intellectual attraction are tunable by ear or have any special<br/>aural salience, using them as signposts and landmarks can be<br/>tokens of our esteem for the regions of the spectrum in which<br/>they appear. For me, this is true of the territory around 410-420<br/>cents, say, with landmarks such as 33/26 (413 cents) and 14/11<br/>(418 cents), as well as the territory around 360-370 cents cents<br/>with landmarks such as 16/13 (359 cents), 21/17 (366 cents), and<br/>26/21 (370 cents). The ratios are a sign of familiarity and<br/>affection.</p><p>And your search for examples, which I often cite to show the<br/>variety of shadings in medieval and modern Near Eastern practice<br/>and theory, and which may or may not point to additional<br/>connections, is laudible. If I had access to video or tools for<br/>analyzing pitch relationships in cents, I might be right in there<br/>with Amine Beyhom, Can Akkoc, Ozan Yarman, you, and others. And I<br/>think what we&apos;ll mainly find is variety, variety, variety.</p><p>&gt;&gt;      (4) You generally find complex integer ratios more<br/>&gt;&gt;          confusing that illuminating, and would really prefer<br/>&gt;&gt;          simply to see measurements in cents.</p><p>&gt; I find that rationals numbers are used in a quasi-religious<br/>&gt; fashion by people purporting to do music theory.  That goes far<br/>&gt; outside the maqam realm.  If somebody has a religious<br/>&gt; fascination with rational numbers, that&apos;s fine by me!  Just say<br/>&gt; so from the start, and for heaven&apos;s sake don&apos;t make objective<br/>&gt; claims about historical or contemporary musical tradition(s),<br/>&gt; supposed health benefits, etc.  That&apos;s dishonest, disrespectful<br/>&gt; to the practitioners of said tradition(s), offtopic, and likely<br/>&gt; to arouse those with allergies to such things, such as myself.</p><p>If you&apos;re referring to the commercialization of traditional<br/>cultures and arts, complete with health and asserted other<br/>marketing claims, and sometimes with totally fictional accounts<br/>presented as actual ethnographic data, then we&apos;re in agreement<br/>with lots of people in those cultures.</p><p>What I hope is that you&apos;re referring to a hypothetical case which<br/>happily has not arisen in the list&apos;s present colloquies on maqam<br/>and dastgah music and tuning, whatever our differences of view.<br/>Of course, it&apos;s possible for honest and respectful analyses to be<br/>theoretically overzealous or simply wrong, and respectful<br/>questioning or outright correction, always I would hope<br/>constructive and polite, is an appropriate response. This<br/>discussion I take to be in that spirit, whatever the merits of<br/>our respective positions.</p><p>Similarly, when we were moderating MakeMicroMusic almost a decade<br/>ago, Jon and Jacky and I instituted a guideline that responses to<br/>posted music should always be courteous and constructive. And<br/>when young people share music, it&apos;s especially important that any<br/>critical response should honor the effort and share an<br/>encouraging word which may, of course, include friendly<br/>suggestions for improvement. One test: is this the kind of<br/>comment that a friendly coach or mentor might offer, and are we<br/>confident enough of our judgment to offer it in that spirit?</p><p>&gt;&gt;      (1) The AEU or mostly Pythagorean model (often featuring<br/>&gt;&gt; schismatic 5-limit approximations) for modern Turkish music<br/>&gt;&gt; actuals fits some flavors of perforance in maqamat such as<br/>&gt;&gt; Rast and Segah, but does not represent important flavors &gt;&gt; such as Rast with rast-segah at around 16 commas or in the &gt;&gt; neighborhood of 360 cents (e.g. 16/13), and fails radically &gt;&gt; to account for prevailing intonational style in maqamat such &gt;&gt; as Ushshaq and Huseyni.</p><p>&gt; While waiting for Ozan to confirm or deny these details, I can<br/>&gt; say I will hardly be surprised if existing theoretical<br/>&gt; proposals, of whatever vintage, are found wanting.</p><p>And I wouldn&apos;t be surprised either!</p><p>&gt; I will add: there is no guarantee that a single master tuning<br/>&gt; exists for all the maqamat.  Of course tunings of arbitrary<br/>&gt; precision, like 1200-ET or 12,000-ET would probably do the job.<br/>&gt; But that would be too easy.  Any such master tuning must<br/>&gt; justify itself via some explanatory power, much like a<br/>&gt; scientific theory.  It must &apos;explain&apos; or reveal common features<br/>&gt; of the maqamat, much like Newton&apos;s laws of gravitation<br/>&gt; explained a variety of different observations of motion made by<br/>&gt; different people at different times.  Otherwise we can be<br/>&gt; perfectly happy knowing a tuning for each maqam, or even at a<br/>&gt; finer level of detail (regional, tetrachordal, etc.) as<br/>&gt; necessary.</p><p>Personally I&apos;d far prefer a case-by-case basis, and my very love<br/>of the diversity and many shadings tends to lean in the other<br/>direction from any unifying theory, much less a &quot;master tuning.&quot;<br/>Even Ozan&apos;s 79/80-MOS of an approximate 159-EDO is meant as a<br/>practical and general solution, but not an all-encompassing one<br/>rendering other tuning systems superfluous.</p><p>One virtue of my 24-note maqam temperaments is that no one is<br/>likely to offer one of these as a &quot;master tuning&quot;!</p><p>&gt; The master tuning of the West, 12-ET, does in fact have such<br/>&gt; explanatory power over Western music, yet it doesn&apos;t go all the<br/>&gt; way.  We need the notion of adaptive JI, along with the idea of<br/>&gt; disposing of only those commas assumed to vanish in the score,<br/>&gt; to get the rest of the way.  Prior to this list I&apos;m not sure<br/>&gt; this had ever been fully realized.  Though people like<br/>&gt; Bosanquet, Groven, Fokker, and Mathieu were definitely on the<br/>&gt; right track.</p><p>Certainly we agree that 12-ET/EDO can serve as either a<br/>modification of Pythagorean tuning (possibly its original<br/>application in 15th-century Italy, as suggested by Mark Lindley,<br/>permitting the same lute fret to be used as a diatonic or<br/>chromatic semitone) or as the upper limit of the meantone zone;<br/>and that adaptive JI is an attractive paradigm for 16th-century<br/>vocal music, for example, especially if one wants to avoid comma<br/>drift.</p><p>A point worthy of quick mention is that problems involving the<br/>syntonic comma are specific to forms of Western music based on<br/>5-limit consonances starting around the 15th century (and at<br/>least a couple of centuries earlier in some English styles), in<br/>contrast to medieval polyphony based on a Pythagorean outlook.</p><p>Another point is that for many people on this list, the Western<br/>composers and styles presenting &quot;the exception that proves the<br/>rule&quot; would be main points of interest: for example Marchettus<br/>and his expressive variations on Pythagorean intonation which<br/>modern performers such as Christopher Page have seen as relevant<br/>to much 13th-14th century French and Italian music; and, of<br/>course, Vicentino, Colonna, and also Gesualdo in the later 16th<br/>and early 17th centuries.</p><p>This isn&apos;t to miss your point that the &quot;master tuning&quot; concept<br/>can lead to some real insights: for example, my typical 24-note<br/>maqam tunings could be considered variations on a &quot;master tuning&quot;<br/>of 17-EDO. And we agree that maqam music as a whole simply can&apos;t<br/>be summed up in this kind of convenient way, using rational<br/>ratios or EDO divisions or anything else we have on hand!</p><p>&gt;&gt; Carl, what I mean by &quot;differences in musical orientation&quot;<br/>&gt;&gt; might be illustrated by your response to a piece of<br/>&gt;&gt; Elizabethan music, &gt; _Come, Sirrah Jack, Ho!_ by Thomas<br/>&gt;&gt; Weelkes. From your post, &gt; I might guess that you are more<br/>&gt;&gt; oriented to 18th-19th century &gt; tonality, and are experiencing<br/>&gt;&gt; this composition from around &gt; 1600 from that perspective.</p><p>&gt; It&apos;s hard to say.  My Dad was an early music geek so I grew up<br/>&gt; with such things -- and sang them in high school and college.<br/>&gt; But perhaps my tonal indoctrination runs deeper than I know.</p><p>Maybe it&apos;s partly training, and partly the proportion of<br/>different influences to which one gravitates.</p><p>&gt;&gt; The same music can, and should, evoke different experiences in<br/>&gt;&gt; different people.</p><p>&gt; Absolutely.</p><p>&gt;&gt; When I heard the piece for the first time around 1976, I&apos;d<br/>&gt;&gt; guess, on an album of the King&apos;s Singers, it sounded to me<br/>&gt;&gt; routinely pleasant, without anything standing out.</p><p>&gt; I wasn&apos;t alive yet in 1976 but I too first heard this<br/>&gt; particular piece on probably that very same King&apos;s Singers<br/>&gt; recording.  It sounded completely normal until I tried to learn<br/>&gt; the parts.</p><p>That&apos;s interesting! I wonder how I might react approaching it at<br/>that level. And it&apos;s humorous how I envisioned you as being<br/>closer to my age, a healthy reminder for me that there are newer<br/>generations. Maybe my misconception that you were around my age<br/>came from the idea of you as &quot;my fellow Berzerkleyan&quot; -- when I<br/>lived in San Francisco, I often visited Berkeley.</p><p>&gt;&gt;      &lt;[117]<a href="http://www.bestII.com/~mschulter/IntradaFLydian.mp3">http://www.bestII.com/~mschulter/IntradaFLydian.mp3</a>&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt;      &lt;[118]<a href="http://www.bestII.com/~mschulter/IntradaFLydian.pdf">http://www.bestII.com/~mschulter/IntradaFLydian.pdf</a>&gt;</p><p>&gt; Thanks for reminding about this piece.

I don&apos;t feel a burning need to test stuff like that.</p><p>&gt; No, I have never considered the pattern as a &quot;circle&quot; the way you have or thought of it as something Charles Lucy might have been confused by and built mis-claims around...but that certainly doesn&apos;t mean I don&apos;t know it.&nbsp; In fact I remember you asking me about a month ago on tuning research &quot;what do you mean by frequency masking?&quot; when you asked about why noise waves don&apos;t sound as dissonant as they &quot;should&quot;.</p><p>I know what frequency masking is. You said that masking would make<br/>noise less dissonant, and I didn&apos;t understand why, and I still don&apos;t.</p><p>&gt; &nbsp;&nbsp; And if you&apos;re going to make huge generalizing statements against me, at least give specific examples so I get a fair chance to say what I do know.</p><p>You asked why spherical wave propagation patterns are unrelated to the<br/>VF phenomenon. I assumed you didn&apos;t understand enough of the acoustics<br/>to see why they&apos;re two entirely different things. If you did, why<br/>would you even think they&apos;re connected at all? How could they possibly<br/>be connected? What if we have a plane wave instead of a spherical<br/>wave? Would that change what VF&apos;s emerge from a given signal? Why? The<br/>whole thing is just silly.</p><p>&gt; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I don&apos;t think what Charles was claiming is &quot;not silly&quot;...I just don&apos;t get how you can attack his claim when all the knowledge you seem to have to know &quot;what he meant&quot; appears nothing more than a guess.</p><p>Because he hasn&apos;t offered any explanation and I don&apos;t see how you<br/>could possibly connect the two things short of the really tenuous link<br/>that I was discussing in the offshoot with Carl. He isn&apos;t even<br/>interested in offering explanations. He is really interested in<br/>patents and stuff like that. If he was just saying &quot;I came up with a<br/>pi-based scale that sounds really cool,&quot; that would be one thing.<br/>Nobody would be attacking his subjective experience of it sounding<br/>good based on science. But why start throwing sciencey stuff out there<br/>if you don&apos;t want to take it into the realm of scientific discussion?</p><p>&gt; Granted, his website is pretty vague about his theories.&nbsp; Furthermore, again, even if he did, say, mean to tie Lucytuning to frequency masking (which obviously does not work)...who cares (it doesn&apos;t, alone, mean it sounds bad)?</p><p>Charles cares.</p><p>&gt; &gt;&quot;I don&apos;t think that there are any 7-tet &quot;acoustics conflicts.&quot; I think that there is a long-standing source of disagreement on this list about the exact resolution of the ear-brain temporal analysis system, and how it can resolve harmonics and how strong the VF system is.&quot;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &nbsp;&nbsp; In that case, what surprises me is that it seems to imply either the VF system is not what defines a lot of the sense of &quot;rootedness&quot; in 7TET or that the system can work differently than it was originally thought to.</p><p>Originally thought to by whom? I just said that everyone has a<br/>completely different opinion on this. We&apos;re all just speculating. Carl<br/>is not the only person on the list and I don&apos;t think he&apos;s ever claimed<br/>to have all the answers for things that are ongoing fields of<br/>research.</p><p>&gt; I still don&apos;t see why you thing Lucytuning is any more &quot;acoustically conflicting&quot; than 7TET...unless you are rating it by its ability to mirror the activity of ascending frequency masking (something you seem to assume but I&apos;ve never heard Charles say IE &quot;by 3D and PI I mean the curve of frequency masking in the Basilar Membrane&quot;).</p><p>I don&apos;t remember ever saying anything like this. I said that the only<br/>possible way I could see &quot;spherical wavefront&quot; or whatever stuff<br/>making any difference at all is through this slight phase distortion<br/>that would result. I don&apos;t think that it has anything to do with VF&apos;s.</p><p>&gt; &gt;&quot;some who think it&apos;s on the super-low side (me, kind of)&quot;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Super low side meaning...there are whole lot of frequencies between things like low-limit JI ratios that act as weak versions of those ratios and imply similar virtual root tones?</p><p>I don&apos;t understand what you mean by this...</p><p>&gt; &gt;&quot;the partials that are close enough to beat end up beating in some kind of recurring<br/>&gt; polyrhythm with one another (&quot;periodicity buzz&quot;)&quot;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Now this really makes me wonder: I understand periodicity buzz as simply equal difference tones IE 300hz 400hz 500hz has a constant 100hz periodicity buzz.&nbsp; I&apos;m guessing the idea revolves around that the oscillation generated by periodicity buzz itself begins to act as the prominent Virtual Fundamental?.</p><p>No. I assure you that you aren&apos;t hearing anything moving 100 times a<br/>second. That is just way too fast for you to hear it.</p><p>&gt; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Never said it would...but I did say (and will say again) that if that did happen, it might get people thinking seriously about finding out what makes it click.&nbsp; And I agree: Charles&apos;s reasons why it supposedly worse seem vague and unprovable via acoustics (at least in the detail he describes them in)...but that doesn&apos;t necessarily mean other people can&apos;t find a better reason why Lucytuning works.</p><p>Sure, here&apos;s one reason why it clicks: it tempers out 81/80 and is a<br/>pretty decent meantone with low error. Whee.</p><p>&gt; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And again, if such a test fails...nothing more to be said and a whole lot of theorists will continue not taking Lucytuning seriously...end of story.</p><p>I don&apos;t know of any special properties that LucyTuning has. I&apos;m not<br/>sure a listening test that compares how much people &quot;like it&quot; vs<br/>&quot;liking&quot; 1/4-comma meantone would give out enough useful information<br/>to figure out why. Just my 2 cents.</p><p>-Mike</p></div><h3><a id=94187 href="#94187">ðŸ”—</a>robert_inventor5 &#x3C;robertwalker@...&#x3E;</h3><span>11/3/2010 6:42:33 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Hi Carl,</p><p>Yes that&apos;s what I mean.</p><p>I don&apos;t have much experience of real world tuning recently. But when I had a &apos;cello I had fine tuning adjustments at the bridge end on every string on the &apos;cello - which lets you adjust it to much more accuracy than a normal &apos;cello. That was before I had a computer even and before my interest in alternative tunings, before I knew what a cent was. So I don&apos;t know what the accuracy was in cents. But my guess is that probably you could do fractional cents with a tuning method like that. Perhaps members with instruments could say a bit about the tuning accuracy of their instruments.</p><p>Sitars are clearly designed for sensitive tuning, and again I&apos;d expect sub cents level tuning accuracy. A google for sitar electronic tuning devices shows quoted accuracy of a tenth of a cent, which may be relevant.</p><p>With the 81/64 then the way I&apos;d imagine it happening is that you learn the 3/2 chain of fifths, and get it that way first - but then learn that as a shortcut you can just tune to it directly once you get used to how it sounds, and (assuming I&apos;m not fooling myself) it is noticeably simpler than its fraction of a cent neighbours which have a more &quot;irregular&quot; feel to the beating patterns. Perhaps rather than smoother, a better way to describe it might be, simpler.</p><p>With the 11/9, it is so obvious I think by just swooping from a minor to a major third, listening to beats as you go, of course assuming you are able to do sub cent level adjustments and the instrument is rich in harmonics - then I think you would spot it easily as a natural point where beats that were apparent to either side of the tuning vanish.</p><p>With Tune Smithy - I could easily implement a dyad with one of the notes continually adjustable. Indeed I think I might have a feature like that already with it adjustable using a controller on the midi keyboard - somewhere in the program, I think in one of the Midi In options windows. It also has triangle wave (also many other wave shapes) in its own internal wave shape player - to high accuracy - pitches accurate to the limit of double precision arithmetic i.e. so decimal value of the interval is accurate to about 14 decimal places. That&apos;s what I&apos;ll use to make the demo clips. And it would be simple programming to hide the display of the pitches and interval, let the reader adjust one of the notes of the dyad - and then display the interval they have found after they do that.</p><p>Only thing is FTS at present is so complex that many of the more advanced features can be hard to find and once found, to learn to use. Also once learnt, easy to forget how it was done if like a year or two later you want to do it again.</p><p>But when I do the upgrade to version 4.x hopefully some time next year then I plan to take what I have learned from Bounce Metronome Pro to make it hopefully much easier to use. So - maybe this time next year - depending on whether I have the time to release 4.x by then, I may be able to do this sort of thing rather easily.</p><p>Robert</p><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;Carl Lumma&quot; &lt;carl@...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Hi Robert,<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; Just tested 11/9 with the triangle wave test, to distinguish it from<br/>&gt; &gt; 347.0 and from 348.0 (11/9 is 347.407)<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; There are very clear beats.

I often wish I had kept it but at the time had no idea I was going to get so interested in tunings, harmonics and so on and wanted to focus on recorder, plus moving from one place to another rather a lot, and a &apos;cello is a big thing to keep carting around when you use it rarely.</p><p>With your slide guitar - can you buy fine tuning adjustments like the ones you can get for a &apos;cello?</p><p>I&apos;m sure it must be a thing that is highly instrument dependent, may also depend on the make of a particular instrument as well, and on what special technical features it has in its construction to help with fine tuning accurately. I mean - of course - for instruments with fixed pitches that need to be tuned such as open strings and keyboard notes etc.</p><p>&gt; &gt; But when I do the upgrade to version 4.x hopefully some time<br/>&gt; &gt; next year then I plan to take what I have learned from Bounce<br/>&gt; &gt; Metronome Pro to make it hopefully much easier to use. So -<br/>&gt; &gt; maybe this time next year - depending on whether I have the<br/>&gt; &gt; time to release 4.x by then, I may be able to do this sort of<br/>&gt; &gt; thing rather easily.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Bounce Metronome looks awesome - I love your videos on YouTube.</p><p>Great glad you like it :). Thanks for the encouragement. The general feedback I get is that I&apos;m on the right track with the program design improvements which is encouraging. And look forward to introducing those to FTS as well.</p><p>All the features of BM Pro such as the 3D graphics for instance will be available for FTS 4.x as well when I do it. Because I do both programs from the same codebase, just different compile directives.</p><p>Thanks,</p><p>Robert</p></div><h3><a id=94192 href="#94192">ðŸ”—</a>robert_inventor5 &#x3C;robertwalker@...&#x3E;</h3><span>11/3/2010 7:41:43 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Good point, Kraig, just bumping this in case anyone missed it, not much to reply except to say I agree!</p><p>Robert</p><p>&gt; I have been enjoying and concurring about what you are saying Robert.<br/>I think one difference in the arts is often one comes up with theories afterwards in order to explain phenomenon to themselves.<br/>This is true of quite a few composers i can think of who just write music and &quot;justify &quot; it later.<br/>Being in such a science heavy society, i think many artist feel they have to explain their actions or directions.<br/>Which i think is unfortunate.</p></div><h3><a id=94193 href="#94193">ðŸ”—</a>Michael &#x3C;djtrancendance@...&#x3E;</h3><span>11/3/2010 7:49:56 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>MikeB&gt;&quot;I said that LucyTuning&apos;s theory about spherical wavefronts or whatever is<br/>obviously wrong acoustically, and for the exact reason I said.&quot;<br/>   It&apos;s right assuming by &quot;spherical&quot; Charles Lucy is talking about the same<br/>phenomenon you are.</p><p>&gt;&quot;He always talks about people not being &quot;bold enough to think outside the box<br/>&gt;and question whether points of maximum consonance don&apos;t coincide with JI ratios&quot;<br/>  So he&apos;s mentioning his theory as a replacement for JI.

It&apos;s so easy for me to have &quot;unspoken&quot;<br/>&gt; understandings about the meaning of my own words not so obvious<br/>&gt; to anyone else.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; And I should briefly mention a couple of my technical<br/>&gt; limitations: I have no means to access or hear videos, or to do<br/>&gt; measurements of frequencies or intervals in cents for a maqam<br/>&gt; performance, say. But I&apos;m immensely interested in what you, Ozan,<br/>&gt; Cameron, Jacques, or others might find.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt; What are the real issues, not necessarily or solely factual,<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt; in question? Well, my own position could be summed up about<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt; like this:<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt;      (1) Medieval Islamic theorists describe tetrachords and<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt; modes which are beautiful and can and should be applied to<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt; medieval and modern maqamat at least some of the time in some<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt; contexts;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; ...Don&apos;t see how anyone could disagree with this.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; And actually this is about 70% of my point, with a helpful<br/>&gt; footnote that I do some rather un-medieval things in my maqam<br/>&gt; tunings, with temperament at the top of the list, and the<br/>&gt; 11:12:13 division (as far as I know) as another.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; What both Ozan and I do, in different ways, is to take some<br/>&gt; leaves from the medieval book and modify them a bit, or at least<br/>&gt; mix in some new ingredients. And for both of us, temperament is<br/>&gt; one of those ingredients. The different ways it&apos;s used in his<br/>&gt; 79/80-MOS or my much more modest O3 could be an interesting topic<br/>&gt; of comparison.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt;      (2) Some of these tunings are closely approximated by<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt; current tunings in practical use in various parts of<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt; the Near East;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; Seems likely, though the word &quot;closely&quot; can be troublesome.<br/>&gt; &gt; The central point I would stress is that we really don&apos;t have<br/>&gt; &gt; much idea what tunings are currently in use, because of a<br/>&gt; &gt; paucity of data.  That ought to lead to some humility, which<br/>&gt; &gt; would be good for all of us.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; What I would predict is that there are far too many variations to<br/>&gt; fall neatly into _any_ model, medieval or later, which<br/>&gt; recognition may be at least the beginning of humility. Looking at<br/>&gt; some measurements of Iranian tunings by Nelly Caron and Dariush<br/>&gt; Safvate, and others by Jean During, as well as Hormoz Farhat&apos;s<br/>&gt; book, I find this variety an inspiration for anyone contemplating<br/>&gt; the infinite shadings possible, and of course a daunting obstacle<br/>&gt; for anyone who wants a single &quot;master tuning&quot; of any practical<br/>&gt; size for a typical acoustical fixed-pitch instrument, as you<br/>&gt; suggest below and I agree.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; And I see integer ratios as signposts or street numbers, not as<br/>&gt; points of unique validity somehow devaluing the territory in<br/>&gt; between those signposts. This brings us to a vital point which I<br/>&gt; find it prudent to explain before posting summaries of measured<br/>&gt; flexible-pitch tunings or instrumental frettings, etc.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; An observation of more or less &quot;close&quot; resemblance could lend<br/>&gt; itself to any of at least three viewpoints:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;          VIEWPOINT I: &quot;Isn&apos;t it wonderful how medieval tunings<br/>&gt;          describe interval sizes and shadings close to those of<br/>&gt;          some tunings used on fixed-pitch instruments or by<br/>&gt;          flexible-pitch performers today?&quot; Here there&apos;s no claim<br/>&gt;          that the rational values are uniquely salient or<br/>&gt;          &quot;attractant,&quot; only a focus on regions or &quot;neighborhoods&quot;<br/>&gt;          of the spectrum, leaving open the question of possible<br/>&gt;          further connections or their lack.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;          VIEWPOINT 2: &quot;The fact that one or more medieval<br/>&gt;          theorists describes this rational tetrachord, and this<br/>&gt;          modern instrument or performance uses or closely<br/>&gt;          approximates it, indicates that the rational ratios<br/>&gt;          themselves, not just the general neighborhood or shading,<br/>&gt;          have some special salience or attractive power.&quot;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;          VIEWPOINT 3: &quot;The correspondence between the medieval<br/>&gt;          ratios and the modern tuning on a fixed-pitch instrument<br/>&gt;          shows some common tradition or acoustical logic of the<br/>&gt;          process of building and playing instruments of the<br/>&gt;          relevant type.&quot;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; My own position is to assert Viewpoint 1 and remain open to<br/>&gt; evidence one way or the other on Viewpoints 2 and 3, the kinds of<br/>&gt; issues raised by Ozan, Cris, and Cameron. Note that my practice<br/>&gt; of using certain superparticular or other rational ratios as<br/>&gt; intellectually attractive signposts or landmarks in itself<br/>&gt; neither affirms nor denies that they may additionally have an<br/>&gt; aurally attractive pull for musicians brought up in these<br/>&gt; traditions, or a special significance in the vocabulary and<br/>&gt; grammar of instrument building, if I may call it that, as a<br/>&gt; variation on Cris&apos;s etymology of numbers and ratios.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; And I must admit that the psychoacoustical theories I would find<br/>&gt; most plausible would be those either developed by dastgah and<br/>&gt; maqam musicians or at least based on culturally specific<br/>&gt; observations of talented performers or listeners brought up in<br/>&gt; these traditions who have a native phonology, so to speak.<br/>&gt; Objective tests of the ability of people practicing maqam or<br/>&gt; dastgah music as a first language to discriminate between shades<br/>&gt; of neutral intervals or degrees of contrast between smaller and<br/>&gt; larger neutral seconds, for example, might be very interesting.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Further, I find in the Islamic theorists of the Mutazilah Era a<br/>&gt; logically attractive lore or discipline focusing on the<br/>&gt; gradations and relations of rational ratios, an outlook also<br/>&gt; reflected in some portions of _Divisions of the Tetrachord_ by<br/>&gt; John Chalmers, that can be embraced while affirming the value of<br/>&gt; irrational ratios and divisions also (which John addresses at<br/>&gt; length), and leaving open psychoacoustical issues that might not<br/>&gt; much affect my artistic outlook, although new knowledge can<br/>&gt; always enrich one&apos;s perspective.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Having said that, I would emphasize that it&apos;s possible to see<br/>&gt; resemblances between a medieval rational tuning and a current<br/>&gt; intonational practice without necessarily saying that the<br/>&gt; specific medieval ratios are precisely represented in, or<br/>&gt; &quot;explain,&quot; the modern performance.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; First, let&apos;s consider the oldest description known to me of the<br/>&gt; tetrachord that would later be called Rast, al-Farabi&apos;s mode of<br/>&gt; Zalzal:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;         1/1    9/8    27/22   4/3<br/>&gt;          0     204     355    498<br/>&gt;            9:8    12:11   88:81<br/>&gt;            204     151     143<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Now consider Amine Beyhom&apos;s estimate (thesis, Vol. I, at p. 52)<br/>&gt; of a typical Lebanese Rast in a &quot;learned&quot; (_savant_) style:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;          0     200    355    500<br/>&gt;            200     155    145<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; When I say that either tuning is &quot;closely approximated&quot; by the<br/>&gt; other, I mean simply that they represent similar shades of what<br/>&gt; has come to be called Rast. What I&apos;d note is not only the similar<br/>&gt; sizes of the neutral thirds, but the subtle difference (around<br/>&gt; 8-10 cents) between the larger and smaller neutral seconds.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I do not mean to imply that the second tuning is intentionally or<br/>&gt; otherwise based on rational ratios, although we might asssociate<br/>&gt; 200 cents with 9:8. But it&apos;s the similar degree of subtle<br/>&gt; difference between the two neutral seconds, with the larger<br/>&gt; placed first, that catches my attention.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; To make my disclaimer more emphatic here, let&apos;s consider a<br/>&gt; tetrachord that Beyhom measured from a performance in Hijaz by<br/>&gt; the Turkish master Kudsi Erguner<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &lt;<a href="http://www.beyhom.com/download/articles/Beyhom_2007_%20Des_criteres_d_authenticite_filigrane_n5.pdf">http://www.beyhom.com/download/articles/Beyhom_2007_%20Des_criteres_d_authenticite_filigrane_n5.pdf</a>&gt;:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;         0     131     368      501<br/>&gt;           131     237      133<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Now I might excitedly, as a self-appointed referee, call &quot;Buzurg&quot;<br/>&gt; and cite two possible tetrachords using the ratios specified for<br/>&gt; this mode (or actually the lower tetrachord of their pentachordal<br/>&gt; schemes) by Safi al-Din al-Urmawi and Qutb al-Din al-Shirazi:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;        1/1    14/13     16/13    4/3<br/>&gt;         0      128       359     498<br/>&gt;           14:13     8:7     13:12<br/>&gt;            128      231      139<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;                      or<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;        1/1    13/12     26/21    4/3<br/>&gt;         0      139       370     498<br/>&gt;           13:12     8:7     14:13<br/>&gt;            128      231      139<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Indeed Erguner&apos;s tetrachord resembles these in having a small<br/>&gt; neutral second, a middle step close to 8:7 (actually a bit<br/>&gt; bigger), and another smallish neutral second. Noting this<br/>&gt; pleasant kinship, however, isn&apos;t to say that Erguner is following<br/>&gt; any rational scheme, or is making a distinction between 14:13 and<br/>&gt; 13:12.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; While I can and will celebrate this as an example of a<br/>&gt; &quot;Buzurg-type Hijaz,&quot; in fact if we are seeking a &quot;close fit,&quot;<br/>&gt; 36-EDO or 46-EDO would be closer than either rational version of<br/>&gt; Buzurg above:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;   Erguner:      0      131      368      501<br/>&gt;                    131      237     133<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;   36-EDO:       0      133      367      500<br/>&gt;                    133      233     133<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;   46-EDO        0      130      365      496<br/>&gt;                    130      235     130<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; And I would certainly not conclude from Erguner&apos;s performance<br/>&gt; that &quot;a Turkish Hijaz of the Buzurg flavor is based on 36-EDO&quot; --<br/>&gt; or 46-EDO, for that matter!<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Actually, modern Turkish or Syrian theory based on 53 commas<br/>&gt; might capture my general category of &quot;Buzurg&quot; as 6-10-6, or here,<br/>&gt; using a suggested refinement of Beyhom for models based on 17 or<br/>&gt; 24 positions per octave, &quot;6- 10+ 6-&quot; to show that each neutral<br/>&gt; second is a bit smaller than 6 commas (about 135 cents) while the<br/>&gt; middle step is a bit larger than 10 commas (about 226-228 cents)<br/>&gt; or even a full 8:7 at 231 cents.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; In some cases, we might be able to draw some kind of<br/>&gt; &quot;etymological&quot; connection, as Cris Forster has put it, or to draw<br/>&gt; some connection between a given fretting scheme and a medieval<br/>&gt; theoretical tradition, as Cameron has proposed. But noting<br/>&gt; and celebrating some interesting resemblances need not itself<br/>&gt; imply either type of connection.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Generally my point in citing and comparing medieval rational<br/>&gt; tunings and more or less kindred modern intonations is to<br/>&gt; illustrate the variety of Near Eastern tetrachords and shadings,<br/>&gt; historical and current.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; However we can say certain things are unlikely.  For instance,<br/>&gt; &gt; choose a rational number R at random, num(R)*den(R) &lt; 10,000<br/>&gt; &gt; and 1 &lt; R &lt; 2.  Let&apos;s say 55/27.  What are the odds it is used<br/>&gt; &gt; systematically in maqam music (that is, it is the target of<br/>&gt; &gt; some bearing plan, fret placement instruction, vocal training<br/>&gt; &gt; regimen, etc, used by more than one musician... that<br/>&gt; &gt; musicians/craftsmen have some means of communicating about it,<br/>&gt; &gt; not necessarily by name, but in *some* fashion)?  Answer: the<br/>&gt; &gt; odds are low and we wouldn&apos;t believe this unless evidence was<br/>&gt; &gt; plainly extant, de novo, of such a bearing plan, fret placement<br/>&gt; &gt; instruction, etc. etc.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; That&apos;s a curious illustration; we&apos;re talking about roughly 1232<br/>&gt; cents (55/27).<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; What&apos;s likely, or relevant, may depend on the question and on<br/>&gt; one&apos;s viewpoint. To describe an interval around 370 cents, as on<br/>&gt; Cameron&apos;s baglama or in my tempered vrsion of a flavor of Turkish<br/>&gt; Rast, by association with the rational signpost of 26/21, or a<br/>&gt; 4/3 less a 14/13, is what some of us find an intuitively<br/>&gt; appealing mapping. And, likewise, an interval in this immediate<br/>&gt; neighborhood might be associated with 99/80, or 9/8 plus 11/10, a<br/>&gt; ratio of around 369 cents occurring in the &quot;Medium Sundered&quot;<br/>&gt; tetrachord of Safi al-Din (9:8-11:10-320:297 or 204-165-129<br/>&gt; cents).<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; These conceptual landmarks are useful to some of us -- not<br/>&gt; necessarily all of us, as you&apos;ve made clear! -- in themselves.<br/>&gt; Whether fretting schemes might favor these superparticular<br/>&gt; patterns more than nearby but distinguishable shadings, and<br/>&gt; whether flexible-pitch performers might be especially drawn to<br/>&gt; them, are open questions.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt;      (3) Just ratios both simple and complex, as well as values<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt; in cents, commas, savarts, etc., can be useful in describing<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt; and analyzing current Near Eastern practice; and<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; I would dispute this beyond the 7-limit.  Within the 7-limit<br/>&gt; &gt; it&apos;s unclear, but plausible, and Weighing Diverse seems to<br/>&gt; &gt; support it.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Note that my &quot;useful&quot; may have a minimalistic sense that<br/>&gt; rationals can provide an intuitively appealing grid (in the eye<br/>&gt; of the beholder!) for mapping and appreciating the continuum of<br/>&gt; neutral or Zalzalian seconds or thirds, for example. Such a grid<br/>&gt; may or may not itself mark points of salient aural attraction, as<br/>&gt; likewise with a grid such as 17-EDO, 24-EDO, or 53-EDO (all of<br/>&gt; which have been proposed or used by Near Eastern theorists).<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt;      (4) Superparticular or other divisions of the medieval<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt; theorists, as well as some modern variations, can nicely evoke<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt; the state of _tarab_ (&quot;enchantment&quot; or &quot;ecstasy&quot;) sought by<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt; performances and audiences as an aspect of the maqam<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt; tradition.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; I&apos;m not sure how to evaluate this.  Beyond the 7-limit I know<br/>&gt; &gt; of no property of superparticular intervals that makes them<br/>&gt; &gt; special in a melodic context, and even within the 7-limit<br/>&gt; &gt; harmonic context, intervals such as 5:3 and 7:4 are on par with<br/>&gt; &gt; superparticulars in terms of their stand-out psychoacoustic<br/>&gt; &gt; properties.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; An ambiguity of my quoted proposition (4), which I&apos;ll clarify<br/>&gt; now, is whether it means &quot;superparticular and other medieval<br/>&gt; divisions alone or especially&quot; or &quot;medieval rational divisions,<br/>&gt; among many others.&quot; My intended reading is totally nonexclusive,<br/>&gt; and thanks for a chance to say so. In other words, &quot;12:13:14 or<br/>&gt; 128-139 cents is beautiful, and 125-137.5 cents in 96-EDO, or<br/>&gt; 133.3-133.3 cents in 36-EDO or 63-EDO, might be comparably so.&quot;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Whether superparticular divisions such as 12:13:14 or 14:13:12<br/>&gt; and 11:12:13 or 13:12:11 have additionally have a special aural<br/>&gt; attraction for expert or other performers growing up in a maqam<br/>&gt; or dastgah tradition is an empirical question. And I find Cris&apos;s<br/>&gt; instrumental etymology, which I&apos;ll need his book to study in more<br/>&gt; detail, quite credible. While Ozan and I have independently been<br/>&gt; drawn to the 13:12:11 or 11:12:13 division for certain maqamat or<br/>&gt; dastgah-ha, let me prudently note again that I&apos;m not aware of any<br/>&gt; medieval sources citing this division.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Also, I don&apos;t know if anyone is claiming that superparticulars<br/>&gt; and only superparticulars are aurally salient: those of us drawn<br/>&gt; to JI/RI have been citing ratios like 13/11, 14/11, and 26/21,<br/>&gt; and certainly would recognize 7/4 as well as 16/9 as significant<br/>&gt; landmarks. And likewise with 11/9, which Cameron found a clear<br/>&gt; aural attractant in certain instrumental timbres (his Spectral<br/>&gt; Harmonic Entropy or SHE).<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt; Carl, please correct me if I am wrong in seeing your main<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt; points as follows:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt; (1) You observe that a 24-EDO model can nicely fit some maqam<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt; perforamnces.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; Yes.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; And I&apos;d add that Near Eastern theorists such as Vaziri in Iran<br/>&gt; have endorsed 24-EDO. I consider it as one point on a continuum.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt;      (2) You regard medieval Islamic theory, and likewise the<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt;      theory of Ptolemy, insofar as it involves superparticular<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt;      or other rational ratios of medium to high complexity, as<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt;      having little reference to either the practice of those<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt;      times or of today -- doubtless allowing an exception for<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt;      those of us who deliberately study and then set out to<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt;      implement these tunings.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; I know of no evidence they&apos;re connected.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; This I see as an open question, which Cris and Cameron may<br/>&gt; address further, and the former addresses in detail in his new<br/>&gt; book. My own artistic program, which no one else is obliged to<br/>&gt; follow (and much less any or all Near Eastern musicians!),<br/>&gt; wouldn&apos;t depend on the answer.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; I know of strong evidence these theorists would have had no<br/>&gt; &gt; alternative but to use rational numbers to express their<br/>&gt; &gt; scales.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; This is a point that Owen Wright also makes. Cris has commented<br/>&gt; that an &quot;equable&quot; division like Ibn Sina&apos;s 14;13:12 or 12:13:14<br/>&gt; is the way of indicating a 7:6 third derived from two near-equal<br/>&gt; steps. While I may like the subtle distinction between 14:13 and<br/>&gt; 13:12, this doesn&apos;t mean a geometric division as in 36-EDO or<br/>&gt; 63-EDO would be &quot;wrong,&quot; or an unequal division like 130-143<br/>&gt; cents not necessarily having any clear rational interpretation<br/>&gt; (I&apos;m just pulling numbers out of the air for my last example).<br/>&gt; One theorist around the 15th or 16th century, as I recall, found<br/>&gt; Ibn Sina&apos;s 12:13:14:16 (139-128-231 cents) or 28:26:24:21<br/>&gt; (128-139-231 cents) less than satisfactory because the two<br/>&gt; neutral second steps are too close to identical!<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Whether Near Eastern musicians are aurally drawn, or drawn by<br/>&gt; instrument designs, to superparticular divisions vis-a-vis<br/>&gt; comparably shaded geometric or unequal but not rationally<br/>&gt; conceived divisions is an open question, and I&apos;m open to a range<br/>&gt; of results, interpretations, and answers.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; [On deliberate modern tuning according to medieval ratios]<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; Of course I allow that exception.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; And that exception is all I really need.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt;     (3) You associate concepts such as &quot;11-limit&quot; with a<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt;         harmonic context where various prime factors are in<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt;         operation (e.g. 2-3-5-7-11, or possibly 2-3-7-11),<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt;         rather than simply a melodic system using ratios such<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt;         as 12:11. If we change &quot;JI&quot; to &quot;RI&quot; (rational<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt;         intonation), and speak of &quot;ratios of 11,&quot; then you<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt;         might be happier.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; Generally the point is that ratios (dyads) of 11 are not<br/>&gt; &gt; tunable by ear either harmonically or melodically.  In triads<br/>&gt; &gt; like 10:11:12, 4:7:11 and so on, available on dulcimers and the<br/>&gt; &gt; like, more can be said of a tendency to gravitate to 11.<br/>&gt; &gt; However I have never heard these relationships in recordings,<br/>&gt; &gt; and Santoor tuning instructions I have seen have not mentioned<br/>&gt; &gt; them.  Now, maybe I should just get out more, which is why I<br/>&gt; &gt; keep asking for examples.  I get accused of insincerity, or<br/>&gt; &gt; just ignored, when I do this.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; While remaining open to a range of results and conclusions on the<br/>&gt; pragmatic question of whether and to what degree melodic<br/>&gt; intervals, dyads, or more complex sonorities can be tuned by ear,<br/>&gt; I might make two points about intonational politics.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; First, tunability or recognizability or reproducibility by ear<br/>&gt; might depend a lot on the cultural background and training of the<br/>&gt; musicians involved. And the usefulness of a given arithmetic<br/>&gt; division or bearing plan for an instrument, as Cameron and Cris<br/>&gt; have discussed, might not depend on whether every interval,<br/>&gt; simple or complex, can be directly tuned by ear.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Secondly, whether or not rational ratios with an intuitive or<br/>&gt; intellectual attraction are tunable by ear or have any special<br/>&gt; aural salience, using them as signposts and landmarks can be<br/>&gt; tokens of our esteem for the regions of the spectrum in which<br/>&gt; they appear. For me, this is true of the territory around 410-420<br/>&gt; cents, say, with landmarks such as 33/26 (413 cents) and 14/11<br/>&gt; (418 cents), as well as the territory around 360-370 cents cents<br/>&gt; with landmarks such as 16/13 (359 cents), 21/17 (366 cents), and<br/>&gt; 26/21 (370 cents). The ratios are a sign of familiarity and<br/>&gt; affection.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; And your search for examples, which I often cite to show the<br/>&gt; variety of shadings in medieval and modern Near Eastern practice<br/>&gt; and theory, and which may or may not point to additional<br/>&gt; connections, is laudible. If I had access to video or tools for<br/>&gt; analyzing pitch relationships in cents, I might be right in there<br/>&gt; with Amine Beyhom, Can Akkoc, Ozan Yarman, you, and others. And I<br/>&gt; think what we&apos;ll mainly find is variety, variety, variety.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt;      (4) You generally find complex integer ratios more<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt;          confusing that illuminating, and would really prefer<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt;          simply to see measurements in cents.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; I find that rationals numbers are used in a quasi-religious<br/>&gt; &gt; fashion by people purporting to do music theory.  That goes far<br/>&gt; &gt; outside the maqam realm.  If somebody has a religious<br/>&gt; &gt; fascination with rational numbers, that&apos;s fine by me!  Just say<br/>&gt; &gt; so from the start, and for heaven&apos;s sake don&apos;t make objective<br/>&gt; &gt; claims about historical or contemporary musical tradition(s),<br/>&gt; &gt; supposed health benefits, etc.  That&apos;s dishonest, disrespectful<br/>&gt; &gt; to the practitioners of said tradition(s), offtopic, and likely<br/>&gt; &gt; to arouse those with allergies to such things, such as myself.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; If you&apos;re referring to the commercialization of traditional<br/>&gt; cultures and arts, complete with health and asserted other<br/>&gt; marketing claims, and sometimes with totally fictional accounts<br/>&gt; presented as actual ethnographic data, then we&apos;re in agreement<br/>&gt; with lots of people in those cultures.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; What I hope is that you&apos;re referring to a hypothetical case which<br/>&gt; happily has not arisen in the list&apos;s present colloquies on maqam<br/>&gt; and dastgah music and tuning, whatever our differences of view.<br/>&gt; Of course, it&apos;s possible for honest and respectful analyses to be<br/>&gt; theoretically overzealous or simply wrong, and respectful<br/>&gt; questioning or outright correction, always I would hope<br/>&gt; constructive and polite, is an appropriate response. This<br/>&gt; discussion I take to be in that spirit, whatever the merits of<br/>&gt; our respective positions.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Similarly, when we were moderating MakeMicroMusic almost a decade<br/>&gt; ago, Jon and Jacky and I instituted a guideline that responses to<br/>&gt; posted music should always be courteous and constructive. And<br/>&gt; when young people share music, it&apos;s especially important that any<br/>&gt; critical response should honor the effort and share an<br/>&gt; encouraging word which may, of course, include friendly<br/>&gt; suggestions for improvement. One test: is this the kind of<br/>&gt; comment that a friendly coach or mentor might offer, and are we<br/>&gt; confident enough of our judgment to offer it in that spirit?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt;      (1) The AEU or mostly Pythagorean model (often featuring<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt; schismatic 5-limit approximations) for modern Turkish music<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt; actuals fits some flavors of perforance in maqamat such as<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt; Rast and Segah, but does not represent important flavors<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt; such as Rast with rast-segah at around 16 commas or in the<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt; neighborhood of 360 cents (e.g. 16/13), and fails radically<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt; to account for prevailing intonational style in maqamat such<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt; as Ushshaq and Huseyni.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; While waiting for Ozan to confirm or deny these details, I can<br/>&gt; &gt; say I will hardly be surprised if existing theoretical<br/>&gt; &gt; proposals, of whatever vintage, are found wanting.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; And I wouldn&apos;t be surprised either!<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; I will add: there is no guarantee that a single master tuning<br/>&gt; &gt; exists for all the maqamat.  Of course tunings of arbitrary<br/>&gt; &gt; precision, like 1200-ET or 12,000-ET would probably do the job.<br/>&gt; &gt; But that would be too easy.  Any such master tuning must<br/>&gt; &gt; justify itself via some explanatory power, much like a<br/>&gt; &gt; scientific theory.  It must &apos;explain&apos; or reveal common features<br/>&gt; &gt; of the maqamat, much like Newton&apos;s laws of gravitation<br/>&gt; &gt; explained a variety of different observations of motion made by<br/>&gt; &gt; different people at different times.  Otherwise we can be<br/>&gt; &gt; perfectly happy knowing a tuning for each maqam, or even at a<br/>&gt; &gt; finer level of detail (regional, tetrachordal, etc.) as<br/>&gt; &gt; necessary.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Personally I&apos;d far prefer a case-by-case basis, and my very love<br/>&gt; of the diversity and many shadings tends to lean in the other<br/>&gt; direction from any unifying theory, much less a &quot;master tuning.&quot;<br/>&gt; Even Ozan&apos;s 79/80-MOS of an approximate 159-EDO is meant as a<br/>&gt; practical and general solution, but not an all-encompassing one<br/>&gt; rendering other tuning systems superfluous.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; One virtue of my 24-note maqam temperaments is that no one is<br/>&gt; likely to offer one of these as a &quot;master tuning&quot;!<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; The master tuning of the West, 12-ET, does in fact have such<br/>&gt; &gt; explanatory power over Western music, yet it doesn&apos;t go all the<br/>&gt; &gt; way.  We need the notion of adaptive JI, along with the idea of<br/>&gt; &gt; disposing of only those commas assumed to vanish in the score,<br/>&gt; &gt; to get the rest of the way.  Prior to this list I&apos;m not sure<br/>&gt; &gt; this had ever been fully realized.  Though people like<br/>&gt; &gt; Bosanquet, Groven, Fokker, and Mathieu were definitely on the<br/>&gt; &gt; right track.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Certainly we agree that 12-ET/EDO can serve as either a<br/>&gt; modification of Pythagorean tuning (possibly its original<br/>&gt; application in 15th-century Italy, as suggested by Mark Lindley,<br/>&gt; permitting the same lute fret to be used as a diatonic or<br/>&gt; chromatic semitone) or as the upper limit of the meantone zone;<br/>&gt; and that adaptive JI is an attractive paradigm for 16th-century<br/>&gt; vocal music, for example, especially if one wants to avoid comma<br/>&gt; drift.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; A point worthy of quick mention is that problems involving the<br/>&gt; syntonic comma are specific to forms of Western music based on<br/>&gt; 5-limit consonances starting around the 15th century (and at<br/>&gt; least a couple of centuries earlier in some English styles), in<br/>&gt; contrast to medieval polyphony based on a Pythagorean outlook.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Another point is that for many people on this list, the Western<br/>&gt; composers and styles presenting &quot;the exception that proves the<br/>&gt; rule&quot; would be main points of interest: for example Marchettus<br/>&gt; and his expressive variations on Pythagorean intonation which<br/>&gt; modern performers such as Christopher Page have seen as relevant<br/>&gt; to much 13th-14th century French and Italian music; and, of<br/>&gt; course, Vicentino, Colonna, and also Gesualdo in the later 16th<br/>&gt; and early 17th centuries.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; This isn&apos;t to miss your point that the &quot;master tuning&quot; concept<br/>&gt; can lead to some real insights: for example, my typical 24-note<br/>&gt; maqam tunings could be considered variations on a &quot;master tuning&quot;<br/>&gt; of 17-EDO. And we agree that maqam music as a whole simply can&apos;t<br/>&gt; be summed up in this kind of convenient way, using rational<br/>&gt; ratios or EDO divisions or anything else we have on hand!<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt; Carl, what I mean by &quot;differences in musical orientation&quot;<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt; might be illustrated by your response to a piece of<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt; Elizabethan music, &gt; _Come, Sirrah Jack, Ho!_ by Thomas<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt; Weelkes. From your post, &gt; I might guess that you are more<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt; oriented to 18th-19th century &gt; tonality, and are experiencing<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt; this composition from around &gt; 1600 from that perspective.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; It&apos;s hard to say.  My Dad was an early music geek so I grew up<br/>&gt; &gt; with such things -- and sang them in high school and college.<br/>&gt; &gt; But perhaps my tonal indoctrination runs deeper than I know.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Maybe it&apos;s partly training, and partly the proportion of<br/>&gt; different influences to which one gravitates.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt; The same music can, and should, evoke different experiences in<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt; different people.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; Absolutely.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt; When I heard the piece for the first time around 1976, I&apos;d<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt; guess, on an album of the King&apos;s Singers, it sounded to me<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt; routinely pleasant, without anything standing out.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; I wasn&apos;t alive yet in 1976 but I too first heard this<br/>&gt; &gt; particular piece on probably that very same King&apos;s Singers<br/>&gt; &gt; recording.  It sounded completely normal until I tried to learn<br/>&gt; &gt; the parts.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; That&apos;s interesting! I wonder how I might react approaching it at<br/>&gt; that level. And it&apos;s humorous how I envisioned you as being<br/>&gt; closer to my age, a healthy reminder for me that there are newer<br/>&gt; generations.

Because if the tension is higher in the open string, as you play then the string gets gradually flatter, or if it is lower in the open string, as you play it will get gradually sharper.</p><p>You can do that by pressing lightly to either side of the bridge, if I remember properly, until the tension evens out, and ditto for the nut.</p><p>So - first you need to adjust the nut end of course with the peg, until approximately in tune. Then even out the tension. Then you can do the fine tuning adjustment, which doesn&apos;t have that same issue of putting the tension out of balance.</p><p>Oh, and it&apos;s important to make sure the bridge is completely flat on the body and steady as well.</p><p>Another subtlety was that as you adjust the tuning of one of the strings it can cause small changes in the tension of the others. Increasing the tension of one string can slightly decrease the tension of the other three. Maybe that&apos;s because it causes the bridge to tilt very slightly, or shift slightly not sure really what it was now.</p><p>And - theoretically at least I think that might also affect the balance of the tension in the three parts of each string i.e. the balance between open string and the bit at either end beyond the bridge and the head though I can&apos;t remember whether it did or not.</p><p>So you could spend a long time just tuning the &apos;cello to get it right.</p><p>Surely depends on make of &apos;cello of course, how sensitive it is to those kinds of things.</p><p>But - that&apos;s memories from maybe two decades ago now, may be hazy.</p><p>Anyway details probably not important, anyone with a &apos;cello will discover them for themselves - but just that there were lots of subtleties and things to learn before you could do accurate really fine tuning adjustments of the instrument and expect that is true of many instruments.</p><p>With the clavichord, of course the pitch of the string varies if you press the key down hard. Though - if one can learn to do that cleanly so the pitch doesn&apos;t vary noticeably at start and end of the note, maybe that could even be a plus, letting one to dynamically adjust the pitches of notes in real time as you play. I don&apos;t know, it is something to find out and explore.</p><p>Yes indeed we are talking about adjustments much less than the normal just noticeable melodic acuity - although that is highly variable between musicians - I find that for myself, it varies quite a bit depending on how much &quot;training&quot; I have had recently, if I&apos;ve been doing something that requires me to listen out for it then my acuity increases temporarily. If you had to do that over a long period of time then I&apos;m pretty sure you would train yourself and it would increase probably permanently to a new base level.</p><p>But anyway - aim is to get a smooth sounding j.i. chord presumably, and so long as you can hear these beats then they will be something you would hear in any played chords sustained for more than a fraction of a second. It should be a noticeable point in the pitch spectrum for the player - assuming capability of doing the adjustments physically and suitable instrument timbre - and in some contexts at least I think listeners would hear it too, you&apos;d be able to say something like &quot;your 11/9 was slightly out - I could hear the beats&quot; though whether you&apos;d be able to say whether the upper note was flat or sharp, I don&apos;t know.</p><p>Would depend on the instrument timbre as well of course, if it had detuned partials e.g. string under high tension the point presumably would be slightly different, you would call it an 11/9 still probably but it would be a smidgen sharper - or whatever - than usual.</p><p>Robert</p><p>--- In tuning@...m, &quot;Carl Lumma&quot; &lt;carl@...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Hi Robert,<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; The few times I&apos;ve tried keyboard tuning - with a clavichord -<br/>&gt; &gt; then you could adjust the tuning with the adjustment key<br/>&gt; &gt; crudely - then you could kind of gently nudge it without actually<br/>&gt; &gt; moving it, which might give much more accurate fine tuning.<br/>&gt; &gt; Though the quietness of the instrument meant you had to listen<br/>&gt; &gt; rather carefully!<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I owned a clavichord in the late &apos;90s -- never an instrument I<br/>&gt; associated with intonation accuracy.  But it did, as all<br/>&gt; pinblock instruments I&apos;ve tuned, have had this &apos;nudge the hammer<br/>&gt; without moving it&apos; possibility.  On a piano, a lot of it is to<br/>&gt; do with getting tensions on either side of the bridge<br/>&gt; to equalize.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; For reference, the elimination a slow, phasing beat with a<br/>&gt; period of 4 seconds between a pair of faint partials at 4 KHz<br/>&gt; represents a tenth of a cent.  It&apos;s about 40 times smaller<br/>&gt; than the melodic just noticeable difference.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; With your slide guitar - can you buy fine tuning adjustments<br/>&gt; &gt; like the ones you can get for a &apos;cello?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I&apos;ve never played a cello but those I&apos;ve seen have not<br/>&gt; seemed paragons of intonation accuracy either.  I suspect<br/>&gt; my slide guitar (open tuning... there are 28 strings) is<br/>&gt; capable of more accuracy than most cellos.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; -Carl<br/>&gt;</p></div><h3><a id=94204 href="#94204">ðŸ”—</a>robert_inventor5 &#x3C;robertwalker@...&#x3E;</h3><span>11/4/2010 2:19:44 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Hi Carl,</p><p>Realise, the fine tuning adjustment would also put the tension out of balance actually. At the nut end it does because it tightens or loosens the portion of string between peg and nut more than it does the rest of the string.</p><p>For the fine tuning adjustment would work the other way, tighten or loosen the open string between bridge and nut slightly more than the other portions of the string.</p><p>So you&apos;d probably need to even out the tension slightly from time to time during the fine tuning adjustments as well.</p><p>So long ago I can&apos;t remember whether I did that or not. I think the thing that particularly made it a long process (though enjoyable) was the tendency of all the other strings to adjust in pitch slightly when you adjust the tuning of one of them so you needed to go round all the strings several times in recursive process until you got it right to your satisfaction. When you hit it spot on then the &apos;cello seems to &quot;sing out&quot; more which is rewarding :). And when you play any of the open strings you hear ringing harmonics from the other strings, also when you play harmonics on one of the strings you hear the harmonics on other strings, if I remember right, long time ago though.</p><p>But I remember I went to a wonderful concert by Mitislav Rostropovitch playing the Bach &apos;cello suites - and he had fine tuning adjustments on all his strings, so obviously felt it worthwhile to fine tune his &apos;cello carefully :).</p><p>Robert</p></div><h3><a id=94205 href="#94205">ðŸ”—</a>cameron &#x3C;misterbobro@...&#x3E;</h3><span>11/4/2010 2:43:40 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Yes I agree- more than agree, because my personal experience is that the simple proportions in the audible harmonic spectrum exert very strong gravities. Melodically as well- last night I sang an ascending 7:6 two cents flat and a 5:4 one cent sharp (according to Adobe Audition pitch analysis, that&apos;s some kind of averaging window of course), not on purpose, wasn&apos;t even aiming for these intervals, but by feeling the vibe of that JI... thing. I couldn&apos;t sing with such accuracy &quot;on purpose&quot; if my life depended on it- it&apos;s just going with the flow of a strong natural phenomenon.</p><p>In a room with a good amount of echo, it must be said.</p><p>Here&apos;s something that had a profound effect on my perception of perception: the teacher passes around two seemingly identical tiny stainless steel ball bearings. Noone in the class could see any difference in size. Well there&apos;s a positivistic indication that the difference between the two is imperceptible, right? Wrong- except for one guy with heavily calloused hands, and one who wouldn&apos;t even give it a try for whatever reason, everyone in the class could FEEL the difference with their eyes closed and distinguish the larger and smaller, checked against micrometer. (seems that precisely this ability was taken advantage of during WWII, in the employment of blind people in factories- obviously Braille comes to mind as well).</p><p>As far as &quot;scientific&quot; perception tests, it seems I can match intervals by ear PERFECTLY! Yeah right. In typically fastiduous but fundamentally clueless fashion, the test I took at a science fair in Germany a few years ago was conducted by putting two different tones into headphones, one in each ear. A very large (super smooth and high quality, nice!) knob changed the frequency of one pitch, the machines tracking the process of course. The test was to tune the pitches to unison.</p><p>Well, unlike the informal test with the ball bearings, which revealed profound truths about human perception, this &quot;scientific&quot; test was a joke: having done plenty of headphone mixing, I immediately percieved that the stereo image of the tones in this test would collapse when the tones were matched. So I just tuned out the stereo and voila.

Regardless of the system, these intervals have served as the bedrock point of departure in order to put forth all those imaginative approaches we have seen for centuries.

It&apos;s so easy for me to have &quot;unspoken&quot;<br/>&gt; &gt; understandings about the meaning of my own words not so obvious<br/>&gt; &gt; to anyone else.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; And I should briefly mention a couple of my technical<br/>&gt; &gt; limitations: I have no means to access or hear videos, or to do<br/>&gt; &gt; measurements of frequencies or intervals in cents for a maqam<br/>&gt; &gt; performance, say. But I&apos;m immensely interested in what you, Ozan,<br/>&gt; &gt; Cameron, Jacques, or others might find.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; What are the real issues, not necessarily or solely factual,<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; in question? Well, my own position could be summed up about<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; like this:<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;      (1) Medieval Islamic theorists describe tetrachords and<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; modes which are beautiful and can and should be applied to<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; medieval and modern maqamat at least some of the time in some<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; contexts;<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; ...Don&apos;t see how anyone could disagree with this.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; And actually this is about 70% of my point, with a helpful<br/>&gt; &gt; footnote that I do some rather un-medieval things in my maqam<br/>&gt; &gt; tunings, with temperament at the top of the list, and the<br/>&gt; &gt; 11:12:13 division (as far as I know) as another.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; What both Ozan and I do, in different ways, is to take some<br/>&gt; &gt; leaves from the medieval book and modify them a bit, or at least<br/>&gt; &gt; mix in some new ingredients. And for both of us, temperament is<br/>&gt; &gt; one of those ingredients. The different ways it&apos;s used in his<br/>&gt; &gt; 79/80-MOS or my much more modest O3 could be an interesting topic<br/>&gt; &gt; of comparison.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;      (2) Some of these tunings are closely approximated by<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; current tunings in practical use in various parts of<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; the Near East;<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; Seems likely, though the word &quot;closely&quot; can be troublesome.<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; The central point I would stress is that we really don&apos;t have<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; much idea what tunings are currently in use, because of a<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; paucity of data.  That ought to lead to some humility, which<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; would be good for all of us.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; What I would predict is that there are far too many variations to<br/>&gt; &gt; fall neatly into _any_ model, medieval or later, which<br/>&gt; &gt; recognition may be at least the beginning of humility. Looking at<br/>&gt; &gt; some measurements of Iranian tunings by Nelly Caron and Dariush<br/>&gt; &gt; Safvate, and others by Jean During, as well as Hormoz Farhat&apos;s<br/>&gt; &gt; book, I find this variety an inspiration for anyone contemplating<br/>&gt; &gt; the infinite shadings possible, and of course a daunting obstacle<br/>&gt; &gt; for anyone who wants a single &quot;master tuning&quot; of any practical<br/>&gt; &gt; size for a typical acoustical fixed-pitch instrument, as you<br/>&gt; &gt; suggest below and I agree.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; And I see integer ratios as signposts or street numbers, not as<br/>&gt; &gt; points of unique validity somehow devaluing the territory in<br/>&gt; &gt; between those signposts. This brings us to a vital point which I<br/>&gt; &gt; find it prudent to explain before posting summaries of measured<br/>&gt; &gt; flexible-pitch tunings or instrumental frettings, etc.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; An observation of more or less &quot;close&quot; resemblance could lend<br/>&gt; &gt; itself to any of at least three viewpoints:<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;          VIEWPOINT I: &quot;Isn&apos;t it wonderful how medieval tunings<br/>&gt; &gt;          describe interval sizes and shadings close to those of<br/>&gt; &gt;          some tunings used on fixed-pitch instruments or by<br/>&gt; &gt;          flexible-pitch performers today?&quot; Here there&apos;s no claim<br/>&gt; &gt;          that the rational values are uniquely salient or<br/>&gt; &gt;          &quot;attractant,&quot; only a focus on regions or &quot;neighborhoods&quot;<br/>&gt; &gt;          of the spectrum, leaving open the question of possible<br/>&gt; &gt;          further connections or their lack.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;          VIEWPOINT 2: &quot;The fact that one or more medieval<br/>&gt; &gt;          theorists describes this rational tetrachord, and this<br/>&gt; &gt;          modern instrument or performance uses or closely<br/>&gt; &gt;          approximates it, indicates that the rational ratios<br/>&gt; &gt;          themselves, not just the general neighborhood or shading,<br/>&gt; &gt;          have some special salience or attractive power.&quot;<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;          VIEWPOINT 3: &quot;The correspondence between the medieval<br/>&gt; &gt;          ratios and the modern tuning on a fixed-pitch instrument<br/>&gt; &gt;          shows some common tradition or acoustical logic of the<br/>&gt; &gt;          process of building and playing instruments of the<br/>&gt; &gt;          relevant type.&quot;<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; My own position is to assert Viewpoint 1 and remain open to<br/>&gt; &gt; evidence one way or the other on Viewpoints 2 and 3, the kinds of<br/>&gt; &gt; issues raised by Ozan, Cris, and Cameron. Note that my practice<br/>&gt; &gt; of using certain superparticular or other rational ratios as<br/>&gt; &gt; intellectually attractive signposts or landmarks in itself<br/>&gt; &gt; neither affirms nor denies that they may additionally have an<br/>&gt; &gt; aurally attractive pull for musicians brought up in these<br/>&gt; &gt; traditions, or a special significance in the vocabulary and<br/>&gt; &gt; grammar of instrument building, if I may call it that, as a<br/>&gt; &gt; variation on Cris&apos;s etymology of numbers and ratios.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; And I must admit that the psychoacoustical theories I would find<br/>&gt; &gt; most plausible would be those either developed by dastgah and<br/>&gt; &gt; maqam musicians or at least based on culturally specific<br/>&gt; &gt; observations of talented performers or listeners brought up in<br/>&gt; &gt; these traditions who have a native phonology, so to speak.<br/>&gt; &gt; Objective tests of the ability of people practicing maqam or<br/>&gt; &gt; dastgah music as a first language to discriminate between shades<br/>&gt; &gt; of neutral intervals or degrees of contrast between smaller and<br/>&gt; &gt; larger neutral seconds, for example, might be very interesting.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; Further, I find in the Islamic theorists of the Mutazilah Era a<br/>&gt; &gt; logically attractive lore or discipline focusing on the<br/>&gt; &gt; gradations and relations of rational ratios, an outlook also<br/>&gt; &gt; reflected in some portions of _Divisions of the Tetrachord_ by<br/>&gt; &gt; John Chalmers, that can be embraced while affirming the value of<br/>&gt; &gt; irrational ratios and divisions also (which John addresses at<br/>&gt; &gt; length), and leaving open psychoacoustical issues that might not<br/>&gt; &gt; much affect my artistic outlook, although new knowledge can<br/>&gt; &gt; always enrich one&apos;s perspective.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; Having said that, I would emphasize that it&apos;s possible to see<br/>&gt; &gt; resemblances between a medieval rational tuning and a current<br/>&gt; &gt; intonational practice without necessarily saying that the<br/>&gt; &gt; specific medieval ratios are precisely represented in, or<br/>&gt; &gt; &quot;explain,&quot; the modern performance.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; First, let&apos;s consider the oldest description known to me of the<br/>&gt; &gt; tetrachord that would later be called Rast, al-Farabi&apos;s mode of<br/>&gt; &gt; Zalzal:<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;         1/1    9/8    27/22   4/3<br/>&gt; &gt;          0     204     355    498<br/>&gt; &gt;            9:8    12:11   88:81<br/>&gt; &gt;            204     151     143<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; Now consider Amine Beyhom&apos;s estimate (thesis, Vol. I, at p. 52)<br/>&gt; &gt; of a typical Lebanese Rast in a &quot;learned&quot; (_savant_) style:<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;          0     200    355    500<br/>&gt; &gt;            200     155    145<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; When I say that either tuning is &quot;closely approximated&quot; by the<br/>&gt; &gt; other, I mean simply that they represent similar shades of what<br/>&gt; &gt; has come to be called Rast. What I&apos;d note is not only the similar<br/>&gt; &gt; sizes of the neutral thirds, but the subtle difference (around<br/>&gt; &gt; 8-10 cents) between the larger and smaller neutral seconds.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; I do not mean to imply that the second tuning is intentionally or<br/>&gt; &gt; otherwise based on rational ratios, although we might asssociate<br/>&gt; &gt; 200 cents with 9:8. But it&apos;s the similar degree of subtle<br/>&gt; &gt; difference between the two neutral seconds, with the larger<br/>&gt; &gt; placed first, that catches my attention.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; To make my disclaimer more emphatic here, let&apos;s consider a<br/>&gt; &gt; tetrachord that Beyhom measured from a performance in Hijaz by<br/>&gt; &gt; the Turkish master Kudsi Erguner<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &lt;<a href="http://www.beyhom.com/download/articles/Beyhom_2007_%20Des_criteres_d_authenticite_filigrane_n5.pdf">http://www.beyhom.com/download/articles/Beyhom_2007_%20Des_criteres_d_authenticite_filigrane_n5.pdf</a>&gt;:<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;         0     131     368      501<br/>&gt; &gt;           131     237      133<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; Now I might excitedly, as a self-appointed referee, call &quot;Buzurg&quot;<br/>&gt; &gt; and cite two possible tetrachords using the ratios specified for<br/>&gt; &gt; this mode (or actually the lower tetrachord of their pentachordal<br/>&gt; &gt; schemes) by Safi al-Din al-Urmawi and Qutb al-Din al-Shirazi:<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;        1/1    14/13     16/13    4/3<br/>&gt; &gt;         0      128       359     498<br/>&gt; &gt;           14:13     8:7     13:12<br/>&gt; &gt;            128      231      139<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;                      or<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;        1/1    13/12     26/21    4/3<br/>&gt; &gt;         0      139       370     498<br/>&gt; &gt;           13:12     8:7     14:13<br/>&gt; &gt;            128      231      139<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; Indeed Erguner&apos;s tetrachord resembles these in having a small<br/>&gt; &gt; neutral second, a middle step close to 8:7 (actually a bit<br/>&gt; &gt; bigger), and another smallish neutral second. Noting this<br/>&gt; &gt; pleasant kinship, however, isn&apos;t to say that Erguner is following<br/>&gt; &gt; any rational scheme, or is making a distinction between 14:13 and<br/>&gt; &gt; 13:12.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; While I can and will celebrate this as an example of a<br/>&gt; &gt; &quot;Buzurg-type Hijaz,&quot; in fact if we are seeking a &quot;close fit,&quot;<br/>&gt; &gt; 36-EDO or 46-EDO would be closer than either rational version of<br/>&gt; &gt; Buzurg above:<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;   Erguner:      0      131      368      501<br/>&gt; &gt;                    131      237     133<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;   36-EDO:       0      133      367      500<br/>&gt; &gt;                    133      233     133<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;   46-EDO        0      130      365      496<br/>&gt; &gt;                    130      235     130<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; And I would certainly not conclude from Erguner&apos;s performance<br/>&gt; &gt; that &quot;a Turkish Hijaz of the Buzurg flavor is based on 36-EDO&quot; --<br/>&gt; &gt; or 46-EDO, for that matter!<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; Actually, modern Turkish or Syrian theory based on 53 commas<br/>&gt; &gt; might capture my general category of &quot;Buzurg&quot; as 6-10-6, or here,<br/>&gt; &gt; using a suggested refinement of Beyhom for models based on 17 or<br/>&gt; &gt; 24 positions per octave, &quot;6- 10+ 6-&quot; to show that each neutral<br/>&gt; &gt; second is a bit smaller than 6 commas (about 135 cents) while the<br/>&gt; &gt; middle step is a bit larger than 10 commas (about 226-228 cents)<br/>&gt; &gt; or even a full 8:7 at 231 cents.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; In some cases, we might be able to draw some kind of<br/>&gt; &gt; &quot;etymological&quot; connection, as Cris Forster has put it, or to draw<br/>&gt; &gt; some connection between a given fretting scheme and a medieval<br/>&gt; &gt; theoretical tradition, as Cameron has proposed. But noting<br/>&gt; &gt; and celebrating some interesting resemblances need not itself<br/>&gt; &gt; imply either type of connection.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; Generally my point in citing and comparing medieval rational<br/>&gt; &gt; tunings and more or less kindred modern intonations is to<br/>&gt; &gt; illustrate the variety of Near Eastern tetrachords and shadings,<br/>&gt; &gt; historical and current.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; However we can say certain things are unlikely.  For instance,<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; choose a rational number R at random, num(R)*den(R) &lt; 10,000<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; and 1 &lt; R &lt; 2.  Let&apos;s say 55/27.  What are the odds it is used<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; systematically in maqam music (that is, it is the target of<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; some bearing plan, fret placement instruction, vocal training<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; regimen, etc, used by more than one musician... that<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; musicians/craftsmen have some means of communicating about it,<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; not necessarily by name, but in *some* fashion)?  Answer: the<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; odds are low and we wouldn&apos;t believe this unless evidence was<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; plainly extant, de novo, of such a bearing plan, fret placement<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; instruction, etc. etc.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; That&apos;s a curious illustration; we&apos;re talking about roughly 1232<br/>&gt; &gt; cents (55/27).<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; What&apos;s likely, or relevant, may depend on the question and on<br/>&gt; &gt; one&apos;s viewpoint. To describe an interval around 370 cents, as on<br/>&gt; &gt; Cameron&apos;s baglama or in my tempered vrsion of a flavor of Turkish<br/>&gt; &gt; Rast, by association with the rational signpost of 26/21, or a<br/>&gt; &gt; 4/3 less a 14/13, is what some of us find an intuitively<br/>&gt; &gt; appealing mapping. And, likewise, an interval in this immediate<br/>&gt; &gt; neighborhood might be associated with 99/80, or 9/8 plus 11/10, a<br/>&gt; &gt; ratio of around 369 cents occurring in the &quot;Medium Sundered&quot;<br/>&gt; &gt; tetrachord of Safi al-Din (9:8-11:10-320:297 or 204-165-129<br/>&gt; &gt; cents).<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; These conceptual landmarks are useful to some of us -- not<br/>&gt; &gt; necessarily all of us, as you&apos;ve made clear! -- in themselves.<br/>&gt; &gt; Whether fretting schemes might favor these superparticular<br/>&gt; &gt; patterns more than nearby but distinguishable shadings, and<br/>&gt; &gt; whether flexible-pitch performers might be especially drawn to<br/>&gt; &gt; them, are open questions.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;      (3) Just ratios both simple and complex, as well as values<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; in cents, commas, savarts, etc., can be useful in describing<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; and analyzing current Near Eastern practice; and<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; I would dispute this beyond the 7-limit.  Within the 7-limit<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; it&apos;s unclear, but plausible, and Weighing Diverse seems to<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; support it.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; Note that my &quot;useful&quot; may have a minimalistic sense that<br/>&gt; &gt; rationals can provide an intuitively appealing grid (in the eye<br/>&gt; &gt; of the beholder!) for mapping and appreciating the continuum of<br/>&gt; &gt; neutral or Zalzalian seconds or thirds, for example. Such a grid<br/>&gt; &gt; may or may not itself mark points of salient aural attraction, as<br/>&gt; &gt; likewise with a grid such as 17-EDO, 24-EDO, or 53-EDO (all of<br/>&gt; &gt; which have been proposed or used by Near Eastern theorists).<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;      (4) Superparticular or other divisions of the medieval<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; theorists, as well as some modern variations, can nicely evoke<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; the state of _tarab_ (&quot;enchantment&quot; or &quot;ecstasy&quot;) sought by<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; performances and audiences as an aspect of the maqam<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; tradition.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; I&apos;m not sure how to evaluate this.  Beyond the 7-limit I know<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; of no property of superparticular intervals that makes them<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; special in a melodic context, and even within the 7-limit<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; harmonic context, intervals such as 5:3 and 7:4 are on par with<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; superparticulars in terms of their stand-out psychoacoustic<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; properties.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; An ambiguity of my quoted proposition (4), which I&apos;ll clarify<br/>&gt; &gt; now, is whether it means &quot;superparticular and other medieval<br/>&gt; &gt; divisions alone or especially&quot; or &quot;medieval rational divisions,<br/>&gt; &gt; among many others.&quot; My intended reading is totally nonexclusive,<br/>&gt; &gt; and thanks for a chance to say so. In other words, &quot;12:13:14 or<br/>&gt; &gt; 128-139 cents is beautiful, and 125-137.5 cents in 96-EDO, or<br/>&gt; &gt; 133.3-133.3 cents in 36-EDO or 63-EDO, might be comparably so.&quot;<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; Whether superparticular divisions such as 12:13:14 or 14:13:12<br/>&gt; &gt; and 11:12:13 or 13:12:11 have additionally have a special aural<br/>&gt; &gt; attraction for expert or other performers growing up in a maqam<br/>&gt; &gt; or dastgah tradition is an empirical question. And I find Cris&apos;s<br/>&gt; &gt; instrumental etymology, which I&apos;ll need his book to study in more<br/>&gt; &gt; detail, quite credible. While Ozan and I have independently been<br/>&gt; &gt; drawn to the 13:12:11 or 11:12:13 division for certain maqamat or<br/>&gt; &gt; dastgah-ha, let me prudently note again that I&apos;m not aware of any<br/>&gt; &gt; medieval sources citing this division.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; Also, I don&apos;t know if anyone is claiming that superparticulars<br/>&gt; &gt; and only superparticulars are aurally salient: those of us drawn<br/>&gt; &gt; to JI/RI have been citing ratios like 13/11, 14/11, and 26/21,<br/>&gt; &gt; and certainly would recognize 7/4 as well as 16/9 as significant<br/>&gt; &gt; landmarks. And likewise with 11/9, which Cameron found a clear<br/>&gt; &gt; aural attractant in certain instrumental timbres (his Spectral<br/>&gt; &gt; Harmonic Entropy or SHE).<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; Carl, please correct me if I am wrong in seeing your main<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; points as follows:<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; (1) You observe that a 24-EDO model can nicely fit some maqam<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; perforamnces.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; Yes.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; And I&apos;d add that Near Eastern theorists such as Vaziri in Iran<br/>&gt; &gt; have endorsed 24-EDO. I consider it as one point on a continuum.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;      (2) You regard medieval Islamic theory, and likewise the<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;      theory of Ptolemy, insofar as it involves superparticular<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;      or other rational ratios of medium to high complexity, as<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;      having little reference to either the practice of those<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;      times or of today -- doubtless allowing an exception for<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;      those of us who deliberately study and then set out to<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;      implement these tunings.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; I know of no evidence they&apos;re connected.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; This I see as an open question, which Cris and Cameron may<br/>&gt; &gt; address further, and the former addresses in detail in his new<br/>&gt; &gt; book. My own artistic program, which no one else is obliged to<br/>&gt; &gt; follow (and much less any or all Near Eastern musicians!),<br/>&gt; &gt; wouldn&apos;t depend on the answer.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; I know of strong evidence these theorists would have had no<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; alternative but to use rational numbers to express their<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; scales.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; This is a point that Owen Wright also makes. Cris has commented<br/>&gt; &gt; that an &quot;equable&quot; division like Ibn Sina&apos;s 14;13:12 or 12:13:14<br/>&gt; &gt; is the way of indicating a 7:6 third derived from two near-equal<br/>&gt; &gt; steps. While I may like the subtle distinction between 14:13 and<br/>&gt; &gt; 13:12, this doesn&apos;t mean a geometric division as in 36-EDO or<br/>&gt; &gt; 63-EDO would be &quot;wrong,&quot; or an unequal division like 130-143<br/>&gt; &gt; cents not necessarily having any clear rational interpretation<br/>&gt; &gt; (I&apos;m just pulling numbers out of the air for my last example).<br/>&gt; &gt; One theorist around the 15th or 16th century, as I recall, found<br/>&gt; &gt; Ibn Sina&apos;s 12:13:14:16 (139-128-231 cents) or 28:26:24:21<br/>&gt; &gt; (128-139-231 cents) less than satisfactory because the two<br/>&gt; &gt; neutral second steps are too close to identical!<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; Whether Near Eastern musicians are aurally drawn, or drawn by<br/>&gt; &gt; instrument designs, to superparticular divisions vis-a-vis<br/>&gt; &gt; comparably shaded geometric or unequal but not rationally<br/>&gt; &gt; conceived divisions is an open question, and I&apos;m open to a range<br/>&gt; &gt; of results, interpretations, and answers.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; [On deliberate modern tuning according to medieval ratios]<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; Of course I allow that exception.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; And that exception is all I really need.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;     (3) You associate concepts such as &quot;11-limit&quot; with a<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;         harmonic context where various prime factors are in<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;         operation (e.g. 2-3-5-7-11, or possibly 2-3-7-11),<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;         rather than simply a melodic system using ratios such<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;         as 12:11. If we change &quot;JI&quot; to &quot;RI&quot; (rational<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;         intonation), and speak of &quot;ratios of 11,&quot; then you<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;         might be happier.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; Generally the point is that ratios (dyads) of 11 are not<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; tunable by ear either harmonically or melodically.  In triads<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; like 10:11:12, 4:7:11 and so on, available on dulcimers and the<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; like, more can be said of a tendency to gravitate to 11.<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; However I have never heard these relationships in recordings,<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; and Santoor tuning instructions I have seen have not mentioned<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; them.  Now, maybe I should just get out more, which is why I<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; keep asking for examples.  I get accused of insincerity, or<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; just ignored, when I do this.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; While remaining open to a range of results and conclusions on the<br/>&gt; &gt; pragmatic question of whether and to what degree melodic<br/>&gt; &gt; intervals, dyads, or more complex sonorities can be tuned by ear,<br/>&gt; &gt; I might make two points about intonational politics.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; First, tunability or recognizability or reproducibility by ear<br/>&gt; &gt; might depend a lot on the cultural background and training of the<br/>&gt; &gt; musicians involved. And the usefulness of a given arithmetic<br/>&gt; &gt; division or bearing plan for an instrument, as Cameron and Cris<br/>&gt; &gt; have discussed, might not depend on whether every interval,<br/>&gt; &gt; simple or complex, can be directly tuned by ear.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; Secondly, whether or not rational ratios with an intuitive or<br/>&gt; &gt; intellectual attraction are tunable by ear or have any special<br/>&gt; &gt; aural salience, using them as signposts and landmarks can be<br/>&gt; &gt; tokens of our esteem for the regions of the spectrum in which<br/>&gt; &gt; they appear. For me, this is true of the territory around 410-420<br/>&gt; &gt; cents, say, with landmarks such as 33/26 (413 cents) and 14/11<br/>&gt; &gt; (418 cents), as well as the territory around 360-370 cents cents<br/>&gt; &gt; with landmarks such as 16/13 (359 cents), 21/17 (366 cents), and<br/>&gt; &gt; 26/21 (370 cents). The ratios are a sign of familiarity and<br/>&gt; &gt; affection.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; And your search for examples, which I often cite to show the<br/>&gt; &gt; variety of shadings in medieval and modern Near Eastern practice<br/>&gt; &gt; and theory, and which may or may not point to additional<br/>&gt; &gt; connections, is laudible. If I had access to video or tools for<br/>&gt; &gt; analyzing pitch relationships in cents, I might be right in there<br/>&gt; &gt; with Amine Beyhom, Can Akkoc, Ozan Yarman, you, and others. And I<br/>&gt; &gt; think what we&apos;ll mainly find is variety, variety, variety.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;      (4) You generally find complex integer ratios more<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;          confusing that illuminating, and would really prefer<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;          simply to see measurements in cents.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; I find that rationals numbers are used in a quasi-religious<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; fashion by people purporting to do music theory.  That goes far<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; outside the maqam realm.  If somebody has a religious<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; fascination with rational numbers, that&apos;s fine by me!  Just say<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; so from the start, and for heaven&apos;s sake don&apos;t make objective<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; claims about historical or contemporary musical tradition(s),<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; supposed health benefits, etc.  That&apos;s dishonest, disrespectful<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; to the practitioners of said tradition(s), offtopic, and likely<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; to arouse those with allergies to such things, such as myself.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; If you&apos;re referring to the commercialization of traditional<br/>&gt; &gt; cultures and arts, complete with health and asserted other<br/>&gt; &gt; marketing claims, and sometimes with totally fictional accounts<br/>&gt; &gt; presented as actual ethnographic data, then we&apos;re in agreement<br/>&gt; &gt; with lots of people in those cultures.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; What I hope is that you&apos;re referring to a hypothetical case which<br/>&gt; &gt; happily has not arisen in the list&apos;s present colloquies on maqam<br/>&gt; &gt; and dastgah music and tuning, whatever our differences of view.<br/>&gt; &gt; Of course, it&apos;s possible for honest and respectful analyses to be<br/>&gt; &gt; theoretically overzealous or simply wrong, and respectful<br/>&gt; &gt; questioning or outright correction, always I would hope<br/>&gt; &gt; constructive and polite, is an appropriate response. This<br/>&gt; &gt; discussion I take to be in that spirit, whatever the merits of<br/>&gt; &gt; our respective positions.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; Similarly, when we were moderating MakeMicroMusic almost a decade<br/>&gt; &gt; ago, Jon and Jacky and I instituted a guideline that responses to<br/>&gt; &gt; posted music should always be courteous and constructive. And<br/>&gt; &gt; when young people share music, it&apos;s especially important that any<br/>&gt; &gt; critical response should honor the effort and share an<br/>&gt; &gt; encouraging word which may, of course, include friendly<br/>&gt; &gt; suggestions for improvement. One test: is this the kind of<br/>&gt; &gt; comment that a friendly coach or mentor might offer, and are we<br/>&gt; &gt; confident enough of our judgment to offer it in that spirit?<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;      (1) The AEU or mostly Pythagorean model (often featuring<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; schismatic 5-limit approximations) for modern Turkish music<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; actuals fits some flavors of perforance in maqamat such as<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; Rast and Segah, but does not represent important flavors<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; such as Rast with rast-segah at around 16 commas or in the<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; neighborhood of 360 cents (e.g. 16/13), and fails radically<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; to account for prevailing intonational style in maqamat such<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; as Ushshaq and Huseyni.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; While waiting for Ozan to confirm or deny these details, I can<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; say I will hardly be surprised if existing theoretical<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; proposals, of whatever vintage, are found wanting.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; And I wouldn&apos;t be surprised either!<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; I will add: there is no guarantee that a single master tuning<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; exists for all the maqamat.  Of course tunings of arbitrary<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; precision, like 1200-ET or 12,000-ET would probably do the job.<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; But that would be too easy.  Any such master tuning must<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; justify itself via some explanatory power, much like a<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; scientific theory.  It must &apos;explain&apos; or reveal common features<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; of the maqamat, much like Newton&apos;s laws of gravitation<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; explained a variety of different observations of motion made by<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; different people at different times.  Otherwise we can be<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; perfectly happy knowing a tuning for each maqam, or even at a<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; finer level of detail (regional, tetrachordal, etc.) as<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; necessary.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; Personally I&apos;d far prefer a case-by-case basis, and my very love<br/>&gt; &gt; of the diversity and many shadings tends to lean in the other<br/>&gt; &gt; direction from any unifying theory, much less a &quot;master tuning.&quot;<br/>&gt; &gt; Even Ozan&apos;s 79/80-MOS of an approximate 159-EDO is meant as a<br/>&gt; &gt; practical and general solution, but not an all-encompassing one<br/>&gt; &gt; rendering other tuning systems superfluous.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; One virtue of my 24-note maqam temperaments is that no one is<br/>&gt; &gt; likely to offer one of these as a &quot;master tuning&quot;!<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; The master tuning of the West, 12-ET, does in fact have such<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; explanatory power over Western music, yet it doesn&apos;t go all the<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; way.  We need the notion of adaptive JI, along with the idea of<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; disposing of only those commas assumed to vanish in the score,<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; to get the rest of the way.  Prior to this list I&apos;m not sure<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; this had ever been fully realized.  Though people like<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; Bosanquet, Groven, Fokker, and Mathieu were definitely on the<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; right track.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; Certainly we agree that 12-ET/EDO can serve as either a<br/>&gt; &gt; modification of Pythagorean tuning (possibly its original<br/>&gt; &gt; application in 15th-century Italy, as suggested by Mark Lindley,<br/>&gt; &gt; permitting the same lute fret to be used as a diatonic or<br/>&gt; &gt; chromatic semitone) or as the upper limit of the meantone zone;<br/>&gt; &gt; and that adaptive JI is an attractive paradigm for 16th-century<br/>&gt; &gt; vocal music, for example, especially if one wants to avoid comma<br/>&gt; &gt; drift.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; A point worthy of quick mention is that problems involving the<br/>&gt; &gt; syntonic comma are specific to forms of Western music based on<br/>&gt; &gt; 5-limit consonances starting around the 15th century (and at<br/>&gt; &gt; least a couple of centuries earlier in some English styles), in<br/>&gt; &gt; contrast to medieval polyphony based on a Pythagorean outlook.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; Another point is that for many people on this list, the Western<br/>&gt; &gt; composers and styles presenting &quot;the exception that proves the<br/>&gt; &gt; rule&quot; would be main points of interest: for example Marchettus<br/>&gt; &gt; and his expressive variations on Pythagorean intonation which<br/>&gt; &gt; modern performers such as Christopher Page have seen as relevant<br/>&gt; &gt; to much 13th-14th century French and Italian music; and, of<br/>&gt; &gt; course, Vicentino, Colonna, and also Gesualdo in the later 16th<br/>&gt; &gt; and early 17th centuries.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; This isn&apos;t to miss your point that the &quot;master tuning&quot; concept<br/>&gt; &gt; can lead to some real insights: for example, my typical 24-note<br/>&gt; &gt; maqam tunings could be considered variations on a &quot;master tuning&quot;<br/>&gt; &gt; of 17-EDO. And we agree that maqam music as a whole simply can&apos;t<br/>&gt; &gt; be summed up in this kind of convenient way, using rational<br/>&gt; &gt; ratios or EDO divisions or anything else we have on hand!<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; Carl, what I mean by &quot;differences in musical orientation&quot;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; might be illustrated by your response to a piece of<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; Elizabethan music, &gt; _Come, Sirrah Jack, Ho!_ by Thomas<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; Weelkes. From your post, &gt; I might guess that you are more<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; oriented to 18th-19th century &gt; tonality, and are experiencing<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; this composition from around &gt; 1600 from that perspective.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; It&apos;s hard to say.  My Dad was an early music geek so I grew up<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; with such things -- and sang them in high school and college.<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; But perhaps my tonal indoctrination runs deeper than I know.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; Maybe it&apos;s partly training, and partly the proportion of<br/>&gt; &gt; different influences to which one gravitates.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; The same music can, and should, evoke different experiences in<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; different people.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; Absolutely.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; When I heard the piece for the first time around 1976, I&apos;d<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; guess, on an album of the King&apos;s Singers, it sounded to me<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; routinely pleasant, without anything standing out.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; I wasn&apos;t alive yet in 1976 but I too first heard this<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; particular piece on probably that very same King&apos;s Singers<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; recording.  It sounded completely normal until I tried to learn<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; the parts.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; That&apos;s interesting! I wonder how I might react approaching it at<br/>&gt; &gt; that level. And it&apos;s humorous how I envisioned you as being<br/>&gt; &gt; closer to my age, a healthy reminder for me that there are newer<br/>&gt; &gt; generations.

I&apos;m sure he and I wouldn&apos;t agree on many things, but my opinion in based on acoustic perceptions in my reality, while his is specifically maqam-oriented and of course infinitely more informed than mine in that area.</p><p>As far as tuning, in practical and implementable manner, of tetrachordal music intended to both incorporate ancient tunings as well as be used in polyphonic music- certainly related to what Ozan is doing, which is why I&apos;d even dare to speak on the subject- I do have a great deal to say.</p><p>It&apos;s clear from simply listening to various maqam musics that the Pythagorean skeletal structures and the simplest of intervals are not sacrosanct- the melodic step is very powerful. Farhat is very big on this. For the creating of a practical system of non-infinite scope- like tuning a qanun- this surely creates a serious problem. If it&apos;s true that microtonal inflections along the lines of, say, a &quot;fourth&quot; at 515 cents (remembered from tuning up to jam along with a video on YouTube) are essential characteristics, the magnitude of the problem of where to temper is clearly immense.</p><p>I don&apos;t face this problem personally, as I simply use  pure, or plainly altered. This (using either pure or plainly altered) is, in my opinion, the only real option in a limited system that is not attempting to shoulder a huge burden. So, concretely: if we assume the ancient preference for superparticulars, we might come up with a very lovely sounding tetrachord of, in step sizes, 11/10, 9/8, 14/13 (in any order). This in my opinion belongs in a rational system, not a tempered system, as we&apos;re looking at a comma of 2080:2079 generated at the 4:3. In a tempered system, temper it out.</p><p>What about the 1287/1280 comma at 4:3 were we to use the also lovely combination of 13/12, 11/10 and 9/8 to make our tetrachord? That&apos;s already almost 9.5 cents. At 12/11, 11/10, 9/8 we&apos;ve got a concrete comma. At almost a syntonic comma wide, I suspect that it may be one of the very commas that grates against 24-tET approximation.</p><p>I just tried to present a how of thinking of it here- first you have to choose the tetrachords you want, then temper. Maqam music has the additional problem of there being being little melodies played in characteristic intonations, not just tetrachords, trichords and pentachords.</p><p>Notice that my argument with Carl probably actually originates in the statement &quot;choose the tetrachords you want&quot;.</p><p>I think it&apos;s just spouting new-agey fog to go on and on about the unfixed nature of pitches in maqam music. &quot;No shit Sherlock- but how in the hell am I going to tune this string to &quot;about 125-140 cents, maybe..&quot;&quot;? Let the unfixed pitches be played by instruments of... unfixed pitch. In the meantime we&apos;ve got to choose SOMETHING for our fixed pitch instruments (and notation!). After you choose the something, you can temper away.</p><p>I assume you&apos;ve read Ozan&apos;s thesis, it&apos;s well worth it if you haven&apos;t.</p><p>-Cameron Bobro</p><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;genewardsmith&quot; &lt;genewardsmith@...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; --- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;cameron&quot; &lt;misterbobro@&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt; &gt; Remember that I said that after a certain point, and I think we actually agree to a pretty good extent what that point is, it becomes a matter of choice what you call things.

Easy example: Cameron, myself, Ozan, Jacques Dudon,<br/>Margo, Igs, now Chris, and several others finding uses for 11-limit in high<br/>consonance and sometimes often &quot;even&quot; high-tune-ably.

Regardless of the system, these intervals have served<br/>&gt; as the bedrock point of departure in order to put forth all<br/>&gt; those imaginative approaches we have seen for centuries. The<br/>&gt; just intervals have been tuned and the only way some tuning<br/>&gt; have even been tuned is by tricks with counting beats and<br/>&gt; comparing it to clocks.</p><p>&gt; This is quite removed from the process in which we deal with<br/>&gt; intervals in music.</p><p>I should clarify that while the main point of my reply to Carl<br/>was that the validity of my music and use of near-just versions<br/>of medieval Islamic and other ratios such as 14/13 or 13/8<br/>doesn&apos;t depend on the question of tunabllity by ear, that doesn&apos;t<br/>mean that I don&apos;t lean in your direction. The fact that I tune by<br/>synthesizer table makes me a bit caution in getting into this<br/>question, but even my imperfect hearing and digital musicmaking<br/>have taught me that these intervals and regions are significant.</p><p>Over the years, how high up the harmonic series one is &quot;supposed&quot;<br/>to be able to hear seems like a fashion statement subject to<br/>rising and falling trends, like hemlines. Thus one theory I<br/>recall from around a decade ago was that &quot;recognizable&quot; ratios or<br/>the like have ratios not greater than a*b=104. That &quot;rule&quot; of<br/>&quot;harmonic entropy&quot; was evidently devised at a time when 13/8 was<br/>in.</p><p>Other times 13/8 may be &quot;out,&quot; or even ratios of 11. I recall a<br/>discussion maybe a decade ago about whether I should really be<br/>describing 14/11 and 13/11 in rational terms.</p><p>And still other times, people involved in the &quot;regular mapping&quot;<br/>approach have told me that it&apos;s possible to tune by ear at least<br/>up to 17:13, although adding that the fact that an interval is so<br/>tunable or &quot;recognizable&quot; doesn&apos;t mean that it necessarily will<br/>seem more consonant than surrounding intervals of the same<br/>region.</p><p>What I know is that I can hear a difference between 14/13 and<br/>13/12, which so nicely complement each other, as in Ibn Sina&apos;s<br/>tetrachord of 28:26:24:21 or, Ozan has suggested, 12:13:14:16.<br/>And George Secor taught me to take ratios of 11 and 13 very<br/>seriously.</p><p>The real comedy is that we have vanguard research here into all<br/>kinds of commas and three-digit and four-digit EDO&apos;s, but<br/>something like 14/13 or 26/21 becomes an exemplar of<br/>&quot;psychoacoustically unfounded theory.&quot;</p><p>&gt; That there are other intervals of great musical expressiveness<br/>&gt; is proven in countless examples around the world.</p><p>Yes, of course, with gamelan and &quot;equable heptaonic&quot; tunings of<br/>many shadings in Southeast Asia and Africa as one example.</p><p>&gt; Still JI intervals will always hold a unique place.</p><p>That;s how I feel, and I have a certain mixed feeling about<br/>tempering, often by not more than 2-3 cents, in order to get a<br/>chain of regular or near-regular fifths -- in O3, for example, at<br/>either 1 or 2 binary millioctaves wide (i.e. 1024-EDO). One main<br/>effect of the tempering is to get an apotome just shy of 14/13,<br/>and a diminished fourth, e.g. B-Eb, at a virtually just 26/21<br/>(370 cents), or sometimes Safi al-Din&apos;s 99/80 (369 cents).</p><p>And in something like Erv&apos;s 1-3-7-9-11-13 eikosony, I do get the<br/>just ratios as occurately as 1024-EDO will permit. And I know he<br/>hasn&apos;t been doctrinaire: he&apos;s done metaslendro, metameantone, and<br/>lots of systems both just and tempered.</p><p>&gt; Partch could tune his 43 tone scale by ear, on instruments that<br/>&gt; often have extremely short durations. Some of these it was<br/>&gt; years before i actually heard some of the chords going on in<br/>&gt; his &apos;Delusion of the Fury&apos;. Most people are so used to these<br/>&gt; not being tuned they hear it as percussion and little more.</p><p>In one book on Partch in my local University library I saw a<br/>diagram of a diamond going up to 17, if I remember correctly,<br/>including 17/14, one of my favorites, and neat for Turkish Maqam<br/>Segah.</p><p>&gt; On the other hand I don&apos;t know of anyone who can get even marginally close to<br/>&gt; 11 or 13 ET or even 22 by ear.</p><p>I&apos;m recalling a post where you humorously suggested that 22 could<br/>be taken as a series of 32:31 steps. That was a reaction to the<br/>trend of viewpoint JI in term of some EDO.</p><p>&gt; It would be unfair if i did not mention recurrent sequences of all having a<br/>&gt; special perceptible property that can be used to tune by paying attention to<br/>&gt; difference tones.</p><p>Maybe it would be a good exercise for me to see if I can become<br/>aware of and learn to recognize some of the difference tones that<br/>might arise in O3. Would 4:6:7 be a good place to start: at one<br/>location, A-E-F#*, it&apos;s around 0-703.1-960.0 cents? Or maybe<br/>something like 6:9:11, A-E-G* at 0-703.1-1048.8 cents?</p><p>If I can learn to recognize different tones, and the temperament<br/>is accurate enough, maybe I could experience some &quot;near-just<br/>phenomena&quot; and feel more confident in these discussions.</p><p>Cameron wrote in response to Kraig:</p><p>&gt;  Yes I agree- more than agree, because my personal experience<br/>&gt;  is that the simple proportions in the audible harmonic<br/>&gt;  spectrum exert very strong gravities.  Melodically as well-<br/>&gt;  last night I sang an ascending 7:6 two cents flat and a 5:4<br/>&gt;  one cent sharp (according to Adobe Audition pitch analysis,<br/>&gt;  that&apos;s some kind of averaging window of course), not on<br/>&gt;  purpose, wasn&apos;t even aiming for these intervals, but by<br/>&gt;  feeling the vibe of that JI... thing. I couldn&apos;t sing with<br/>&gt;  such accuracy &quot;on purpose&quot; if my life depended on it- it&apos;s<br/>&gt;  just going with the flow of a strong natural phenomenon.</p><p>Hi, Cameron.</p><p>Thanks for adding your experience, and also your comments about<br/>11/9 and the importance of instrument-specific SHE.</p><p>One question: do you find yourself singing at or near<br/>superparticular ratios for neutral or Zalzalian seconds like<br/>14:13, 13:12, 12:11, and 11:10 (about which you posted in an<br/>article I&apos;m answering next)? I see no reason these shouldn&apos;t be<br/>recognizable with practice and a bit of stylistic familiarity,<br/>which you have. There&apos;s an example in Ozan&apos;s thesis that looks<br/>like 14:13:12 to him and me alike, and I&apos;ve heard that this<br/>division or 12:13:14 occurs in some other world musics.</p><p>Your baglama posts have really got me mobilized, and I really<br/>enjoyed your remark about being drawn to 11/7. This is my usual<br/>regular minor sixth, with my maqam tunings tending to support<br/>both 14/9 and 11/7 in some locations, and one or the other in<br/>lots more, although my 14/9&apos;s are notorious for getting tempered<br/>to 273/176&apos;s or the like about four or five cents narrower!</p><p>My musical abilities, however imperfect, do permit me to<br/>appreciate that Rast with a 16/13 and with a 26/21 are different<br/>flavors, and I like both. A few months ago, Ozan was talking<br/>about 370 cents as a historically prevant tuning of perde segah<br/>in Rast, and your baglama seems to have hit the spot.</p><p>One point about ratios: I&apos;ve been told that luthiers still use<br/>the 16th-century &quot;Rule of 18&quot; to fret acoustically near-equal<br/>semitones, using a ratio of 18:17 which, when fretting physics<br/>comes into play, actually yields a more accurate 100 cents than<br/>the &quot;logarithmically correct&quot; spacing.</p><p>Why not a &quot;Rule of 14&quot; for the baglama or the like: for example,<br/>place the 4/3 fret in usual Pythagorean fashion, and then place<br/>the fret the third of Rast (perde segah) so as to add another<br/>13th part in length, producing an interval of 14:13, or of 26/21<br/>from the 1/1?</p><p>I can easily see this kind of thing being handed down. Safi<br/>al-Din al-Urmawi&apos;s &quot;Medium Sundered&quot; tetrachord of<br/>9/8-11/10-320/297 (which leads to my next intended post) shows<br/>another method for placing an almost identical segah fret.<br/>Tune a 9/8 in usual Pythagorean fashion (as your six-year-old sun<br/>might say, two soldierlies up and an octave down), and then place<br/>a fret spaced from this by 1/11 of the remaining length. We could<br/>call this a &quot;Rule of 11.&quot;</p><p>The temperament issues you raise I&apos;ll get into with my next post,<br/>where I&apos;ll also ask some questions about the rest of the baglama<br/>tuning whose lowest tetrachord you&apos;ve posted -- but hopefully<br/>questions that won&apos;t require more measures, and might be<br/>approached largely on the basis of which fourths or fifths are<br/>pure or notably otherwise, etc.</p><p>[Later note: having found that addressing your temperament<br/>questions produced a long post in itself, I will try to get to<br/>those baglama questions tomorrow.]</p><p>With many thanks,</p><p>Margo</p></div><h3><a id=94260 href="#94260">ðŸ”—</a>Margo Schulter &#x3C;mschulter@...&#x3E;</h3><span>11/5/2010 1:25:09 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>[Dear Cameron: In what follows I address some temeperament<br/>questions and some of the tetrachords you discuss, as well as a<br/>couple of others that might illustrate some related comma<br/>questions.

And the kind of tuning or temperament system will reflect<br/>both the medieval Islamic and more recent tetrachords in use, and<br/>the logic of a given polyphonic style. That can mean creative<br/>compromises in various directions -- and often dramatically<br/>different ones for different people and styles.</p><p>Thus for Ozan, &quot;polyphony&quot; often means a desire for thirds at or<br/>close to 5/4 -- or ideally a tad lower, by the schisma of Safi<br/>al-Din al-Urmawi and the 24-note Pythgorean model of AEU, or<br/>maybe around 382 cents, as suggested in one of his posts. Since<br/>Ozan also wants an optional meantone path to that Rast third near<br/>5/4, he uses a 79/80-MOS very close to 159-EDO, with some fifths<br/>tempered by 1/3 Holderian comma or 1/159 octave while others<br/>remain literally pure (by minute modifications to 159-EDO) or<br/>virtually pure. There are both schismatic and meantone paths to<br/>that 5/4 region, and the temperament of some fifths by over 7<br/>cents (a bit more than in 19-EDO) is the necessary and logical<br/>compromise to achieve that goal.</p><p>For me, &quot;polyphony&quot; means adopting 13th-14th century European<br/>techniques to a maqam context rich with its Zalzalian steps and<br/>intervals. In 13th-14th century music of Continental Europe,<br/>based mostly on Pythagorean intonation, fifths and fourths are<br/>the stable consonances, with thirds and sixths more or less<br/>relatively concordant but complex and unstable, seeking<br/>resolution to unisons, fifths, or octaves, for example. So<br/>neutral thirds at various ratios fit in nicely. And something<br/>like 26/21 is especially dilectable, because 370 cents is like a<br/>&quot;Zalzalian ditone&quot; with the same kind of pleasant complexity as<br/>14/11 at 418 cents, for example.</p><p>These are two different worlds. In Ozan&apos;s, 5/4 and 6/5 are needed<br/>both as fitting one side of current Turkish maqam practice which<br/>might be traced back at least to the 17-note Pythagorean<br/>&quot;Systematist&quot; theory of the 13th century (and I believe Cris<br/>shows to further back than that), and to meet the needs of his<br/>polyphonic style using 5-limit consonances.</p><p>In mine, the emphasis is on ratios of 2-3-7-11-13, and any<br/>occurrences of 5/4 or 6/5 approximations are more or less<br/>incidental, rather than a basic or intended feature of a<br/>neomedieval system. The rules of counterpoint can apply to<br/>general categories of intervals: for example, &quot;a major, minor, or<br/>Zalzalian third often tends to contract to a unison or expand to<br/>a fifth.&quot;</p><p>Furthermore, Ozan for his purposes needs an option for a<br/>circulating 12-note chromatic scale to permit compatibility with<br/>Western music based on a 12-note well-temperament or 12-EDO, one<br/>of the design principles of his 79/80-MOS. What I need is<br/>compatibility with 13th-14th century European style based on<br/>Pythagoran intonation, of which I see a single 12-note keyboard<br/>in O3 as a gentle modification, with an Eb-G# chain of fifths<br/>tempered in 1024-EDO at an average of around 703.871 cents.</p><p>And temperament is an essential ingredient for both of us. Thus<br/>on Ozan&apos;s 79/80-tone qanun, we have a suggested Rast (following<br/>his thesis, p. 118(, of 0-196-392-498 cents, with the major third<br/>being formed from two meantone steps of 196 cents. As he notes,<br/>it is possible to spell this tetrachord simply C-D-E-F.</p><p>While temperament gets Ozan his meantone path to a near-5/4, it<br/>gets me my &quot;neo-Systematist&quot; path to neutral or Zalzalian<br/>intervals found within a single 12-note keyboard, for example in<br/>a Rast tetrachord like B-C#-Eb-E at 0-207-369-496 cents or<br/>207-162-127 cents. Note that on a Pythagorean keyboard, this same<br/>spelling would result in a schismatic tetrachord of 0-204-384-498<br/>cents, or 204-180-114 cents. These &quot;schismatic&quot; mappings thus<br/>generate on each of the two 12-note keyboards the smallest and<br/>largest neutral intervals, for example steps near 14:13 and<br/>11:10, while combining notes from the two keyboards (spaced at<br/>57.422 cents) produces central neutral intervals like steps near<br/>13:12 and 12:11.</p><p>Here I don&apos;t want to get too enmeshed in the mechanics of the<br/>79/80-MOS, on which Ozan is of course the expert, and O3, but to<br/>give some idea of how polyphonic styles can vary and influence<br/>tuning systems to move in different directions while still<br/>sharing common themes like a desire for accurate representations<br/>of superparticular middle seconds.</p><p>&gt; It&apos;s clear from simply listening to various maqam musics that<br/>&gt; the Pythagorean skeletal structures and the simplest of<br/>&gt; intervals are not sacrosanct- the melodic step is very<br/>&gt; powerful. Farhat is very big on this. For the creating of a<br/>&gt; practical system of non-infinite scope- like tuning a qanun-<br/>&gt; this surely creates a serious problem. If it&apos;s true that<br/>&gt; microtonal inflections along the lines of, say, a &quot;fourth&quot; at<br/>&gt; 515 cents (remembered from tuning up to jam along with a video<br/>&gt; on YouTube) are essential characteristics, the magnitude of the<br/>&gt; problem of where to temper is clearly immense.</p><p>If circulation isn&apos;t a consideration, which it certainly isn&apos;t in<br/>traditional Iranian music or Farhat&apos;s 17-note tar tuning, then<br/>&quot;odd&quot; fourths and fifths can be a strength. For example, in the<br/>24-note O3 temperament, we have a location where the closest<br/>available fourth is 485 cents -- almost identical, as I learned<br/>in a book by Nelly Caron and Dariouche Safvate, to a 484-cent<br/>fourth used in a traditional tuning of a beautiful dastgah or<br/>avaz (a satellite dastgah to the principal seven) known as the<br/>Old Bayat-e Tork. They give 0-204-346-484-704-908-980-1200<br/>cents.</p><p>More generally, the Iranian taste for septimal or near-septimal<br/>intervals means that we&apos;re not going to get a tidy 17-note<br/>circulating system on tar. Caron and Safvate, on the basis of<br/>measuring one or more instruments, give a Shur tetrachord at<br/>0-136-276-500 cents or 136-140-224 cents. A large tone that close<br/>to 8:7 means that we can expect at least one notably narrow<br/>fourth of the kind found in the &quot;Old Tork&quot; above.</p><p>In O3, we have 24 positions and 22 of them with usual fifths at<br/>703.1 or 704.3 cents -- the &quot;odd&quot; two at G#-Eb* (an asterisk<br/>showing a note on the upper keyboard) with a 714.8-cent fifth,<br/>and G#*-E at 726.6 cents, or close to 32/21. And there are a<br/>number of locations with a choice between 4/3 or 21/16, something<br/>George Secor has taught me to relish, and nice for doing<br/>different interpretations of Maqam &grave;Iraq (some Syrians favor a<br/>fourth at 21 commas or around 475 cents, realized at 472 or 473<br/>cents in this temperament).</p><p>For Ozan, it _is_ vital to circulate, and he&apos;s made some<br/>intricate and delicate compromises to do so while supporting lots<br/>of neutral or Zalzalian flavors, among many other things.</p><p>&gt; I don&apos;t face this problem personally, as I simply use pure, or<br/>&gt; plainly altered.  This (using either pure or plainly altered)<br/>&gt; is, in my opinion, the only real option in a limited system<br/>&gt; that is not attempting to shoulder a huge burden.</p><p>Yes, and the &quot;limited system&quot; concept certainly applies to O3<br/>with only 24 notes. Not being concerned with either circulation<br/>or the syntonic comma simplifies lots of things, and means a<br/>gentle degree of temperament is all that&apos;s needed.</p><p>&gt; So, concretely: if we assume the ancient preference for<br/>&gt; superparticulars, we might come up with a very lovely sounding<br/>&gt; tetrachord of, in step sizes, 11/10, 9/8, 14/13 (in any<br/>&gt; order). This in my opinion belongs in a rational system, not a<br/>&gt; tempered system, as we&apos;re looking at a comma of 2080:2079<br/>&gt; generated at the 4:3.  In a tempered system, temper it out.</p><p>In fact you&apos;ve just brought up the topic of one of my favorite<br/>tetrachords, so nicely illustrated on your baglama, and which<br/>I&apos;ve been discussing in some of my Ethno Extras articles. This is<br/>Safi al-Din al-Urmawi&apos;s &quot;Medium Sundered&quot; which slightly enlarges<br/>the 14/13 to make a full 4/3: 9/8-11/10-320/297 or 204-165-129<br/>cents.</p><p>A JI solution might be to &quot;temper by ratios&quot; by keeping  all<br/>steps superparticular, 9/8-11/10-14/13, and letting that fourth<br/>be narrow by a 2080:2079, less than a cent. But I guess that the<br/>idea of a tetrachord at a just 4:3 led Safi al-Din to stretch the<br/>14:13 by that amount instead.</p><p>On your baglama at 202-168-128 cents, a slightly enlarged 11/10<br/>takes up the slack for the minutely narrow 9/8 as well as the<br/>virtually just 14/13 -- two cents for the first, and another cent<br/>for the second, placing it at 168 rather than 165 cents. If the<br/>9/8 were precisely just, we might similarly stretch 11/10 by<br/>exactly 2080:2079, getting 208/189 and a tuning of 204-166-128<br/>cents.</p><p>Now let&apos;s see what happens in O3 for a similar tetrachord. Giving<br/>Safi al-Din his due, we&apos;ll start with the tempered tetrachord<br/>closest to his 9/8-11/10-320/297. Then we&apos;ll see what happens in<br/>the almost identical tetrachord closest in its third size to your<br/>baglama.</p><p>          Safi al-Din:   1/1     9/8    99/80   4/3<br/>                         0.0    203.9   368.9  498.0<br/>                             9:8    11:10  320:297<br/>                            203.9   165.0   129.1</p><p>          O3:             B       C#     Eb      E<br/>                         0.0    207.4   369.1  495.7<br/>                            207.4   161.7   126.6</p><p>While the tempered neutral third at 369.1 cents is almost<br/>identical to Safi al-Din&apos;s 99/80, the tone B-C# more than<br/>compensates for the 2080:2079 comma in the JI version by its<br/>wideness of about 3.5 cents in comparison to 9/8. The fourth,<br/>tempered at about 2.3 cents narrow, is impure by an amount almost<br/>three times that of the comma. And in the process, 11/10 gets<br/>compressed to 161.7 cents, or by about 3.3 cents, just a tad more<br/>than the 3.24 cents set as a maximum for the impurity of the<br/>ratios supported in his 29-HTT (secor29htt.scl in the Scala<br/>archive).</p><p>If we focus specifically on the interval from the neutral third<br/>to the fourth, Eb-E in the tempered version, we find that the<br/>third at 369.1 cents is a virtually just 99/80, but that the<br/>narrowing of the fourth by some 2.3 cents more than accounts for<br/>the 2080:2079 comma, indeed so much so that the remaining 14/13<br/>step, for from needing a bit of widening as in Safi al-Din, is<br/>actually narrow by about 1.7 cents (126.6 vs. 128.3 cents).</p><p>Now let&apos;s look at a trivially different tempered tetrachord<br/>closer to your baglama&apos;s slightly larger neutral third, which<br/>I&apos;ll call a virtually just 26/21, likewise taking your fourth as<br/>a just 4/3:</p><p>    Cameron&apos;s baglama:    0        202     370   498<br/>                              202      168    128</p><p>    O3:                   F#       G#      Bb     B<br/>                          0       208.6   370.3 496.9<br/>                             208.6    161.7  126.6</p><p>Here the two upper melodic steps of the tempered tetrachord are<br/>identical to those of the last, but the major second at 208.6<br/>cents, and the fourth at 496.9 cents, are 1/1024 octave larger.<br/>Your baglama and O3 may be about equally far in their central<br/>steps from a just 11/10 at 165 cents, albeit in opposite<br/>directions, Here, with the tempered third at a virtually just<br/>26/21, the remaining step would be a just 14/13 -- except that<br/>the fourth is narrow, this time by about 1.2 cents.</p><p>&gt; What about the 1287/1280 comma at 4:3 were we to use the also<br/>&gt; lovely combination of 13/12, 11/10 and 9/8 to make our<br/>&gt; tetrachord? That&apos;s already almost 9.5 cents.</p><p>Humorously, with O3, I can give the answer that the steps aren&apos;t<br/>so arranged that it&apos;s possible to combine these ratios all in a<br/>single tetrachord, so the question doesn&apos;t arise &lt;grin&gt;. What O3<br/>does have with 9/8 and 13/12 that might go a step further is this<br/>tetrachord in the manner of one school of Aleppo for Maqam &grave;Iraq:</p><p>         Eb    E     F#     G*<br/>         0   126.6  334.0  472.3<br/>          126.6  207.4  138.3</p><p>My point here, leaving aside the fine points of this tetrachord<br/>(apart from noting that the Syrian 6-9-6 commas would be around<br/>135-340-475 cents, with my 126.6-cent step rather smaller),<br/>is that altered fourths and fifths sometimes go with the<br/>territory. But let&apos;s get back to 13/12, 11/10, and 9/8, and see<br/>how Ozan&apos;s 79-MOS might handle this. Suppose we want to keep all<br/>three superparticular steps as close as possible to just. If we<br/>start on step 13 of his scale (Scala archives, 79-159.scl), his<br/>tempered or meantone major second step in Maqam Rast known as<br/>perde dugah, we can do the following:</p><p>JI:            1/1     13/12  143/120  429/320<br/>                0      138.6   303.6    507.4<br/>                  13/12    11/10     9/8<br/>                  138.6    165.0    203.9</p><p> yarmans:       0       9        20      33L<br/> 79-MOS:        0     135.8    301.9    505.7<br/>                 135.8     166.0    203.8<br/>                   9        11       13L</p><p>You&apos;ll see that Ozan&apos;s meantone fourth at 505.7 cents, or 1/3<br/>Holderian comma wide, absorbs most of the burden of that<br/>1287/1280 comma, with the narrowing of 13/12 by not quite 3 cents<br/>taking up the rest of the comma, and also compensating for the<br/>tempering of 11/10 at about a cent wide. The numbers of yarmans,<br/>or 79-MOS steps normally at 2/3 Holderian comma (2/159 octave) or<br/>just over 15 cents, may help clarify the process. In the 79-MOS,<br/>there is one &quot;large&quot; step at a full comma or about 1/53 octave,<br/>and the notations &quot;33L&quot; for the fourth and &quot;13L&quot; for the 9/8 step<br/>that concludes the tetrachord show an interval including this<br/>large or full-comma tuning step.</p><p>Another solution would be to trim the 9/8 by 1/3 comma, and let<br/>the fourth remain precisely or virtually pure. For example,<br/>starting on Ozan&apos;s 1/1 or perde rast:</p><p>JI:            1/1     13/12  143/120  429/320<br/>                0      138.6   303.6    507.4<br/>                  13/12    11/10     9/8<br/>                  138.6    165.0    203.9</p><p> yarmans:       0        9       20      33<br/> 79-MOS:        0      135.8   301.9    498.1<br/>                 135.8     166.0    196.2<br/>                   9        11        13</p><p>This time the upper major second gets narrowed by the lion&apos;s<br/>share of the comma instead of the fourth being widened by a<br/>comparable amount, and all the intervals are built from regular<br/>tuning steps of 2/3 Holderian comma or around 15 cents.</p><p>&gt; At 12/11, 11/10, 9/8 we&apos;ve got a concrete comma. At almost a<br/>&gt; syntonic comma wide, I suspect that it may be one of the very<br/>&gt; commas that grates against 24-tET approximation.</p><p>Here my first reaction is that 12/11 plus 11/10 should be<br/>precisely a 6/5, and that plus 9/8 precisely a 27/20, so that we<br/>are indeed a syntonic comma wide. Change the 9/8 to a 10/9, and<br/>we have a 4/3, as well as Ptolemy&apos;s Equable Diatonic that Cris<br/>was recently discussing, at 12:11:10:9.</p><p>But this might invite the consideration of one more case where<br/>the comma involved using only superparticular ratios must somehow<br/>be accounted for, and a temperament stays fairly close to one JI<br/>solution. Let&apos;s consider a tetrachord which could be used in<br/>Persian Shur, Arab Bayyati, or Turkish Arazbar, for example:</p><p>JI:       1/1    13/12   13/11     4/3<br/>           0     138.6   289.2    498.0<br/>            13:12    12:11    44:39<br/>            138.6    150.6    208.8</p><p>O3:        F#      G*      A        B<br/>           0     138.3   289.5    496.9<br/>            138.3    151.2    207.4</p><p>In the just version, we have a 13:12:11 division of a 13/11 minor<br/>third, so that reaching a pure 4/3 requires a major second wider<br/>than 9/8 by a 352:351 at some 4.9 cents, in other words a 44/39,<br/>thus, on monochord, 52:48:44:39.</p><p>In O3, the 13/12 and 12/11 steps are virtually just, so the<br/>352:351 gets handled essentially in two ways. First, the tone at<br/>207.4 cents is about 3.5 cents wide of 9/8, and not too far from<br/>44/39. Secondly, the fourth is narrow by not quite 1.2 cents. As<br/>it happens, the 13/11 is at this location a tad wide at 289.5<br/>cents compared to a just 289.2, helping with the comma also.  At<br/>some other locations, where 13/11 is not quite a cent narrow of<br/>just at 288.3 cents, a wider major second at 208.6 cents (almost<br/>precisely 44/39), or narrower fourth at 495.7 cents, is there to<br/>compensate.</p><p>So we have commas of less than a cent, like the 2080:2079 as with<br/>the beautiful Rast tetrachord made famous by your baglama (Safi<br/>al-Din didn&apos;t call it Rast, but it wonderfully fits that maqam);<br/>commas of around 4-5 cents like the 352:351; and the &quot;biggies&quot;<br/>like your 1207:1280 example approaching 9.5 cents, and yet more<br/>so the 81:80 at 21.5 cents or the 64/63 at 27.3 cents.</p><p>With the larger commas, I take a &quot;JI-ish&quot; perspective: let them<br/>stand. For me, the 64:63 is the main one I deal with regularly.<br/>In O3, some small ones like the 352:351 are tempered out, while<br/>the 2080:2079 might in a sense be &quot;observed&quot; (e.g. 369.1 cents as<br/>Safi al-Din&apos;s 99/80, and 370.3 cents as your baglama&apos;s 26/21),<br/>hopefully while keeping a &quot;quasi-rational&quot; structure for the most<br/>part intact.</p><p>And large commas can be invaluable, not only for yielding<br/>&quot;special effects&quot; intervals like 21/16 when we want them, but for<br/>permitting more choices: a smaller or larger neutral second to<br/>start this tetrachord, or a 7/4 or a 16/9? Jacques and I both<br/>seem to devise 17-note sets or subsets, for Persian music for<br/>example, and then throw in a couple of extra notes to add comma<br/>alternatives.</p><p>Please forgive me if this is too long: a lot of this stuff about<br/>maqam tetrachords and tempering may not have been presented so<br/>systematically before, and, of course, what I&apos;ve written about<br/>Ozan&apos;s 79/80-MOS is very much subject to his correction or<br/>amendment!</p><p>Most appreciatively,</p><p>Margo<br/>mschulter@...</p></div><h3><a id=94263 href="#94263">ðŸ”—</a>cameron &#x3C;misterbobro@...&#x3E;</h3><span>11/5/2010 2:17:07 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Margo- I&apos;m delighted to be reading this!

And the kind of tuning or temperament system will reflect<br/>&gt; both the medieval Islamic and more recent tetrachords in use, and<br/>&gt; the logic of a given polyphonic style. That can mean creative<br/>&gt; compromises in various directions -- and often dramatically<br/>&gt; different ones for different people and styles.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Thus for Ozan, &quot;polyphony&quot; often means a desire for thirds at or<br/>&gt; close to 5/4 -- or ideally a tad lower, by the schisma of Safi<br/>&gt; al-Din al-Urmawi and the 24-note Pythgorean model of AEU, or<br/>&gt; maybe around 382 cents, as suggested in one of his posts. Since<br/>&gt; Ozan also wants an optional meantone path to that Rast third near<br/>&gt; 5/4, he uses a 79/80-MOS very close to 159-EDO, with some fifths<br/>&gt; tempered by 1/3 Holderian comma or 1/159 octave while others<br/>&gt; remain literally pure (by minute modifications to 159-EDO) or<br/>&gt; virtually pure. There are both schismatic and meantone paths to<br/>&gt; that 5/4 region, and the temperament of some fifths by over 7<br/>&gt; cents (a bit more than in 19-EDO) is the necessary and logical<br/>&gt; compromise to achieve that goal.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; For me, &quot;polyphony&quot; means adopting 13th-14th century European<br/>&gt; techniques to a maqam context rich with its Zalzalian steps and<br/>&gt; intervals. In 13th-14th century music of Continental Europe,<br/>&gt; based mostly on Pythagorean intonation, fifths and fourths are<br/>&gt; the stable consonances, with thirds and sixths more or less<br/>&gt; relatively concordant but complex and unstable, seeking<br/>&gt; resolution to unisons, fifths, or octaves, for example. So<br/>&gt; neutral thirds at various ratios fit in nicely. And something<br/>&gt; like 26/21 is especially dilectable, because 370 cents is like a<br/>&gt; &quot;Zalzalian ditone&quot; with the same kind of pleasant complexity as<br/>&gt; 14/11 at 418 cents, for example.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; These are two different worlds. In Ozan&apos;s, 5/4 and 6/5 are needed<br/>&gt; both as fitting one side of current Turkish maqam practice which<br/>&gt; might be traced back at least to the 17-note Pythagorean<br/>&gt; &quot;Systematist&quot; theory of the 13th century (and I believe Cris<br/>&gt; shows to further back than that), and to meet the needs of his<br/>&gt; polyphonic style using 5-limit consonances.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; In mine, the emphasis is on ratios of 2-3-7-11-13, and any<br/>&gt; occurrences of 5/4 or 6/5 approximations are more or less<br/>&gt; incidental, rather than a basic or intended feature of a<br/>&gt; neomedieval system. The rules of counterpoint can apply to<br/>&gt; general categories of intervals: for example, &quot;a major, minor, or<br/>&gt; Zalzalian third often tends to contract to a unison or expand to<br/>&gt; a fifth.&quot;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Furthermore, Ozan for his purposes needs an option for a<br/>&gt; circulating 12-note chromatic scale to permit compatibility with<br/>&gt; Western music based on a 12-note well-temperament or 12-EDO, one<br/>&gt; of the design principles of his 79/80-MOS. What I need is<br/>&gt; compatibility with 13th-14th century European style based on<br/>&gt; Pythagoran intonation, of which I see a single 12-note keyboard<br/>&gt; in O3 as a gentle modification, with an Eb-G# chain of fifths<br/>&gt; tempered in 1024-EDO at an average of around 703.871 cents.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; And temperament is an essential ingredient for both of us. Thus<br/>&gt; on Ozan&apos;s 79/80-tone qanun, we have a suggested Rast (following<br/>&gt; his thesis, p. 118(, of 0-196-392-498 cents, with the major third<br/>&gt; being formed from two meantone steps of 196 cents. As he notes,<br/>&gt; it is possible to spell this tetrachord simply C-D-E-F.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; While temperament gets Ozan his meantone path to a near-5/4, it<br/>&gt; gets me my &quot;neo-Systematist&quot; path to neutral or Zalzalian<br/>&gt; intervals found within a single 12-note keyboard, for example in<br/>&gt; a Rast tetrachord like B-C#-Eb-E at 0-207-369-496 cents or<br/>&gt; 207-162-127 cents. Note that on a Pythagorean keyboard, this same<br/>&gt; spelling would result in a schismatic tetrachord of 0-204-384-498<br/>&gt; cents, or 204-180-114 cents. These &quot;schismatic&quot; mappings thus<br/>&gt; generate on each of the two 12-note keyboards the smallest and<br/>&gt; largest neutral intervals, for example steps near 14:13 and<br/>&gt; 11:10, while combining notes from the two keyboards (spaced at<br/>&gt; 57.422 cents) produces central neutral intervals like steps near<br/>&gt; 13:12 and 12:11.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Here I don&apos;t want to get too enmeshed in the mechanics of the<br/>&gt; 79/80-MOS, on which Ozan is of course the expert, and O3, but to<br/>&gt; give some idea of how polyphonic styles can vary and influence<br/>&gt; tuning systems to move in different directions while still<br/>&gt; sharing common themes like a desire for accurate representations<br/>&gt; of superparticular middle seconds.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; It&apos;s clear from simply listening to various maqam musics that<br/>&gt; &gt; the Pythagorean skeletal structures and the simplest of<br/>&gt; &gt; intervals are not sacrosanct- the melodic step is very<br/>&gt; &gt; powerful. Farhat is very big on this. For the creating of a<br/>&gt; &gt; practical system of non-infinite scope- like tuning a qanun-<br/>&gt; &gt; this surely creates a serious problem. If it&apos;s true that<br/>&gt; &gt; microtonal inflections along the lines of, say, a &quot;fourth&quot; at<br/>&gt; &gt; 515 cents (remembered from tuning up to jam along with a video<br/>&gt; &gt; on YouTube) are essential characteristics, the magnitude of the<br/>&gt; &gt; problem of where to temper is clearly immense.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; If circulation isn&apos;t a consideration, which it certainly isn&apos;t in<br/>&gt; traditional Iranian music or Farhat&apos;s 17-note tar tuning, then<br/>&gt; &quot;odd&quot; fourths and fifths can be a strength. For example, in the<br/>&gt; 24-note O3 temperament, we have a location where the closest<br/>&gt; available fourth is 485 cents -- almost identical, as I learned<br/>&gt; in a book by Nelly Caron and Dariouche Safvate, to a 484-cent<br/>&gt; fourth used in a traditional tuning of a beautiful dastgah or<br/>&gt; avaz (a satellite dastgah to the principal seven) known as the<br/>&gt; Old Bayat-e Tork. They give 0-204-346-484-704-908-980-1200<br/>&gt; cents.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; More generally, the Iranian taste for septimal or near-septimal<br/>&gt; intervals means that we&apos;re not going to get a tidy 17-note<br/>&gt; circulating system on tar. Caron and Safvate, on the basis of<br/>&gt; measuring one or more instruments, give a Shur tetrachord at<br/>&gt; 0-136-276-500 cents or 136-140-224 cents. A large tone that close<br/>&gt; to 8:7 means that we can expect at least one notably narrow<br/>&gt; fourth of the kind found in the &quot;Old Tork&quot; above.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; In O3, we have 24 positions and 22 of them with usual fifths at<br/>&gt; 703.1 or 704.3 cents -- the &quot;odd&quot; two at G#-Eb* (an asterisk<br/>&gt; showing a note on the upper keyboard) with a 714.8-cent fifth,<br/>&gt; and G#*-E at 726.6 cents, or close to 32/21. And there are a<br/>&gt; number of locations with a choice between 4/3 or 21/16, something<br/>&gt; George Secor has taught me to relish, and nice for doing<br/>&gt; different interpretations of Maqam &grave;Iraq (some Syrians favor a<br/>&gt; fourth at 21 commas or around 475 cents, realized at 472 or 473<br/>&gt; cents in this temperament).<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; For Ozan, it _is_ vital to circulate, and he&apos;s made some<br/>&gt; intricate and delicate compromises to do so while supporting lots<br/>&gt; of neutral or Zalzalian flavors, among many other things.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; I don&apos;t face this problem personally, as I simply use pure, or<br/>&gt; &gt; plainly altered.  This (using either pure or plainly altered)<br/>&gt; &gt; is, in my opinion, the only real option in a limited system<br/>&gt; &gt; that is not attempting to shoulder a huge burden.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Yes, and the &quot;limited system&quot; concept certainly applies to O3<br/>&gt; with only 24 notes. Not being concerned with either circulation<br/>&gt; or the syntonic comma simplifies lots of things, and means a<br/>&gt; gentle degree of temperament is all that&apos;s needed.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; So, concretely: if we assume the ancient preference for<br/>&gt; &gt; superparticulars, we might come up with a very lovely sounding<br/>&gt; &gt; tetrachord of, in step sizes, 11/10, 9/8, 14/13 (in any<br/>&gt; &gt; order). This in my opinion belongs in a rational system, not a<br/>&gt; &gt; tempered system, as we&apos;re looking at a comma of 2080:2079<br/>&gt; &gt; generated at the 4:3.  In a tempered system, temper it out.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; In fact you&apos;ve just brought up the topic of one of my favorite<br/>&gt; tetrachords, so nicely illustrated on your baglama, and which<br/>&gt; I&apos;ve been discussing in some of my Ethno Extras articles. This is<br/>&gt; Safi al-Din al-Urmawi&apos;s &quot;Medium Sundered&quot; which slightly enlarges<br/>&gt; the 14/13 to make a full 4/3: 9/8-11/10-320/297 or 204-165-129<br/>&gt; cents.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; A JI solution might be to &quot;temper by ratios&quot; by keeping  all<br/>&gt; steps superparticular, 9/8-11/10-14/13, and letting that fourth<br/>&gt; be narrow by a 2080:2079, less than a cent. But I guess that the<br/>&gt; idea of a tetrachord at a just 4:3 led Safi al-Din to stretch the<br/>&gt; 14:13 by that amount instead.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; On your baglama at 202-168-128 cents, a slightly enlarged 11/10<br/>&gt; takes up the slack for the minutely narrow 9/8 as well as the<br/>&gt; virtually just 14/13 -- two cents for the first, and another cent<br/>&gt; for the second, placing it at 168 rather than 165 cents. If the<br/>&gt; 9/8 were precisely just, we might similarly stretch 11/10 by<br/>&gt; exactly 2080:2079, getting 208/189 and a tuning of 204-166-128<br/>&gt; cents.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Now let&apos;s see what happens in O3 for a similar tetrachord. Giving<br/>&gt; Safi al-Din his due, we&apos;ll start with the tempered tetrachord<br/>&gt; closest to his 9/8-11/10-320/297. Then we&apos;ll see what happens in<br/>&gt; the almost identical tetrachord closest in its third size to your<br/>&gt; baglama.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;            Safi al-Din:   1/1     9/8    99/80   4/3<br/>&gt;                           0.0    203.9   368.9  498.0<br/>&gt;                               9:8    11:10  320:297<br/>&gt;                              203.9   165.0   129.1<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;            O3:             B       C#     Eb      E<br/>&gt;                           0.0    207.4   369.1  495.7<br/>&gt;                              207.4   161.7   126.6<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; While the tempered neutral third at 369.1 cents is almost<br/>&gt; identical to Safi al-Din&apos;s 99/80, the tone B-C# more than<br/>&gt; compensates for the 2080:2079 comma in the JI version by its<br/>&gt; wideness of about 3.5 cents in comparison to 9/8. The fourth,<br/>&gt; tempered at about 2.3 cents narrow, is impure by an amount almost<br/>&gt; three times that of the comma. And in the process, 11/10 gets<br/>&gt; compressed to 161.7 cents, or by about 3.3 cents, just a tad more<br/>&gt; than the 3.24 cents set as a maximum for the impurity of the<br/>&gt; ratios supported in his 29-HTT (secor29htt.scl in the Scala<br/>&gt; archive).<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; If we focus specifically on the interval from the neutral third<br/>&gt; to the fourth, Eb-E in the tempered version, we find that the<br/>&gt; third at 369.1 cents is a virtually just 99/80, but that the<br/>&gt; narrowing of the fourth by some 2.3 cents more than accounts for<br/>&gt; the 2080:2079 comma, indeed so much so that the remaining 14/13<br/>&gt; step, for from needing a bit of widening as in Safi al-Din, is<br/>&gt; actually narrow by about 1.7 cents (126.6 vs. 128.3 cents).<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Now let&apos;s look at a trivially different tempered tetrachord<br/>&gt; closer to your baglama&apos;s slightly larger neutral third, which<br/>&gt; I&apos;ll call a virtually just 26/21, likewise taking your fourth as<br/>&gt; a just 4/3:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;      Cameron&apos;s baglama:    0        202     370   498<br/>&gt;                                202      168    128<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;      O3:                   F#       G#      Bb     B<br/>&gt;                            0       208.6   370.3 496.9<br/>&gt;                               208.6    161.7  126.6<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Here the two upper melodic steps of the tempered tetrachord are<br/>&gt; identical to those of the last, but the major second at 208.6<br/>&gt; cents, and the fourth at 496.9 cents, are 1/1024 octave larger.<br/>&gt; Your baglama and O3 may be about equally far in their central<br/>&gt; steps from a just 11/10 at 165 cents, albeit in opposite<br/>&gt; directions, Here, with the tempered third at a virtually just<br/>&gt; 26/21, the remaining step would be a just 14/13 -- except that<br/>&gt; the fourth is narrow, this time by about 1.2 cents.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; What about the 1287/1280 comma at 4:3 were we to use the also<br/>&gt; &gt; lovely combination of 13/12, 11/10 and 9/8 to make our<br/>&gt; &gt; tetrachord? That&apos;s already almost 9.5 cents.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Humorously, with O3, I can give the answer that the steps aren&apos;t<br/>&gt; so arranged that it&apos;s possible to combine these ratios all in a<br/>&gt; single tetrachord, so the question doesn&apos;t arise &lt;grin&gt;. What O3<br/>&gt; does have with 9/8 and 13/12 that might go a step further is this<br/>&gt; tetrachord in the manner of one school of Aleppo for Maqam &grave;Iraq:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;           Eb    E     F#     G*<br/>&gt;           0   126.6  334.0  472.3<br/>&gt;            126.6  207.4  138.3<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; My point here, leaving aside the fine points of this tetrachord<br/>&gt; (apart from noting that the Syrian 6-9-6 commas would be around<br/>&gt; 135-340-475 cents, with my 126.6-cent step rather smaller),<br/>&gt; is that altered fourths and fifths sometimes go with the<br/>&gt; territory. But let&apos;s get back to 13/12, 11/10, and 9/8, and see<br/>&gt; how Ozan&apos;s 79-MOS might handle this. Suppose we want to keep all<br/>&gt; three superparticular steps as close as possible to just. If we<br/>&gt; start on step 13 of his scale (Scala archives, 79-159.scl), his<br/>&gt; tempered or meantone major second step in Maqam Rast known as<br/>&gt; perde dugah, we can do the following:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; JI:            1/1     13/12  143/120  429/320<br/>&gt;                  0      138.6   303.6    507.4<br/>&gt;                    13/12    11/10     9/8<br/>&gt;                    138.6    165.0    203.9<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;   yarmans:       0       9        20      33L<br/>&gt;   79-MOS:        0     135.8    301.9    505.7<br/>&gt;                   135.8     166.0    203.8<br/>&gt;                     9        11       13L<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; You&apos;ll see that Ozan&apos;s meantone fourth at 505.7 cents, or 1/3<br/>&gt; Holderian comma wide, absorbs most of the burden of that<br/>&gt; 1287/1280 comma, with the narrowing of 13/12 by not quite 3 cents<br/>&gt; taking up the rest of the comma, and also compensating for the<br/>&gt; tempering of 11/10 at about a cent wide. The numbers of yarmans,<br/>&gt; or 79-MOS steps normally at 2/3 Holderian comma (2/159 octave) or<br/>&gt; just over 15 cents, may help clarify the process. In the 79-MOS,<br/>&gt; there is one &quot;large&quot; step at a full comma or about 1/53 octave,<br/>&gt; and the notations &quot;33L&quot; for the fourth and &quot;13L&quot; for the 9/8 step<br/>&gt; that concludes the tetrachord show an interval including this<br/>&gt; large or full-comma tuning step.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Another solution would be to trim the 9/8 by 1/3 comma, and let<br/>&gt; the fourth remain precisely or virtually pure. For example,<br/>&gt; starting on Ozan&apos;s 1/1 or perde rast:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; JI:            1/1     13/12  143/120  429/320<br/>&gt;                  0      138.6   303.6    507.4<br/>&gt;                    13/12    11/10     9/8<br/>&gt;                    138.6    165.0    203.9<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;   yarmans:       0        9       20      33<br/>&gt;   79-MOS:        0      135.8   301.9    498.1<br/>&gt;                   135.8     166.0    196.2<br/>&gt;                     9        11        13<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; This time the upper major second gets narrowed by the lion&apos;s<br/>&gt; share of the comma instead of the fourth being widened by a<br/>&gt; comparable amount, and all the intervals are built from regular<br/>&gt; tuning steps of 2/3 Holderian comma or around 15 cents.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; At 12/11, 11/10, 9/8 we&apos;ve got a concrete comma. At almost a<br/>&gt; &gt; syntonic comma wide, I suspect that it may be one of the very<br/>&gt; &gt; commas that grates against 24-tET approximation.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Here my first reaction is that 12/11 plus 11/10 should be<br/>&gt; precisely a 6/5, and that plus 9/8 precisely a 27/20, so that we<br/>&gt; are indeed a syntonic comma wide. Change the 9/8 to a 10/9, and<br/>&gt; we have a 4/3, as well as Ptolemy&apos;s Equable Diatonic that Cris<br/>&gt; was recently discussing, at 12:11:10:9.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; But this might invite the consideration of one more case where<br/>&gt; the comma involved using only superparticular ratios must somehow<br/>&gt; be accounted for, and a temperament stays fairly close to one JI<br/>&gt; solution. Let&apos;s consider a tetrachord which could be used in<br/>&gt; Persian Shur, Arab Bayyati, or Turkish Arazbar, for example:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; JI:       1/1    13/12   13/11     4/3<br/>&gt;             0     138.6   289.2    498.0<br/>&gt;              13:12    12:11    44:39<br/>&gt;              138.6    150.6    208.8<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; O3:        F#      G*      A        B<br/>&gt;             0     138.3   289.5    496.9<br/>&gt;              138.3    151.2    207.4<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; In the just version, we have a 13:12:11 division of a 13/11 minor<br/>&gt; third, so that reaching a pure 4/3 requires a major second wider<br/>&gt; than 9/8 by a 352:351 at some 4.9 cents, in other words a 44/39,<br/>&gt; thus, on monochord, 52:48:44:39.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; In O3, the 13/12 and 12/11 steps are virtually just, so the<br/>&gt; 352:351 gets handled essentially in two ways. First, the tone at<br/>&gt; 207.4 cents is about 3.5 cents wide of 9/8, and not too far from<br/>&gt; 44/39. Secondly, the fourth is narrow by not quite 1.2 cents. As<br/>&gt; it happens, the 13/11 is at this location a tad wide at 289.5<br/>&gt; cents compared to a just 289.2, helping with the comma also.  At<br/>&gt; some other locations, where 13/11 is not quite a cent narrow of<br/>&gt; just at 288.3 cents, a wider major second at 208.6 cents (almost<br/>&gt; precisely 44/39), or narrower fourth at 495.7 cents, is there to<br/>&gt; compensate.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; So we have commas of less than a cent, like the 2080:2079 as with<br/>&gt; the beautiful Rast tetrachord made famous by your baglama (Safi<br/>&gt; al-Din didn&apos;t call it Rast, but it wonderfully fits that maqam);<br/>&gt; commas of around 4-5 cents like the 352:351; and the &quot;biggies&quot;<br/>&gt; like your 1207:1280 example approaching 9.5 cents, and yet more<br/>&gt; so the 81:80 at 21.5 cents or the 64/63 at 27.3 cents.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; With the larger commas, I take a &quot;JI-ish&quot; perspective: let them<br/>&gt; stand. For me, the 64:63 is the main one I deal with regularly.<br/>&gt; In O3, some small ones like the 352:351 are tempered out, while<br/>&gt; the 2080:2079 might in a sense be &quot;observed&quot; (e.g. 369.1 cents as<br/>&gt; Safi al-Din&apos;s 99/80, and 370.3 cents as your baglama&apos;s 26/21),<br/>&gt; hopefully while keeping a &quot;quasi-rational&quot; structure for the most<br/>&gt; part intact.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; And large commas can be invaluable, not only for yielding<br/>&gt; &quot;special effects&quot; intervals like 21/16 when we want them, but for<br/>&gt; permitting more choices: a smaller or larger neutral second to<br/>&gt; start this tetrachord, or a 7/4 or a 16/9? Jacques and I both<br/>&gt; seem to devise 17-note sets or subsets, for Persian music for<br/>&gt; example, and then throw in a couple of extra notes to add comma<br/>&gt; alternatives.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Please forgive me if this is too long: a lot of this stuff about<br/>&gt; maqam tetrachords and tempering may not have been presented so<br/>&gt; systematically before, and, of course, what I&apos;ve written about<br/>&gt; Ozan&apos;s 79/80-MOS is very much subject to his correction or<br/>&gt; amendment!<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Most appreciatively,<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Margo<br/>&gt; mschulter@...<br/>&gt;</p></div><h3><a id=94265 href="#94265">ðŸ”—</a>robert_inventor5 &#x3C;robertwalker@...&#x3E;</h3><span>11/5/2010 2:20:28 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Hi Carl,</p><p>Thanks, that&apos;s interesting, about how pianos are tuned. Does seem to be a related thing.</p><p>With the &apos;cello then I only tuned the open strings to 3/2s. Though - you also then have the harmonics as well, when you play harmonics which you can do on two strings at once.</p><p>Not sure when you&apos;d play an 11/9 on the open strings. Though I suppose you might specify an 11/9 interval of the strings, e.g. tune top string down to say F half sharp instead of A for a microtonal piece for scordatura &apos;cello, similar idea to the Bach &apos;cello suite 5 (A tuned down to G). That might be a fun idea for a &apos;cello playing microtonal composer to explore :).</p><p>As for resolution while playing the notes with the fingers - well I can&apos;t speak from experience. Certainly can be quite accurate I imagine - not just sliding the finger, can just roll it slightly to micro adjust the pitch similar to the nudging of a tuning peg, but not sure how accurate you can get. I suppose there will be some limit or other,</p><p>It would be interesting to hear from &apos;cello players if you can eliminate beats on an 11/9 dyad on long held notes played without vibrato.</p><p>Snapping into a chord like that directly at start of a note would presumably be more challenging.</p><p>You&apos;d expect it to be easier on a &apos;cello than on say a violin as the strings are so long. Probably double bass would be even better for accurate pitching of dyads. Also the lower the pitch, the slower the beats, and so less accuracy of placement needed to get a chord that sounds beatless to the ears. And the lower the pitch then the lower the pitch of the partials which may help make them a bit more obvious perhaps.</p><p>Just a few thoughts, as I don&apos;t have a &apos;cello to hand to try it out on.</p><p>Robert</p><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;Carl Lumma&quot; &lt;carl@...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Hi Robert,<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; You can do that by pressing lightly to either side of the<br/>&gt; &gt; bridge, if I remember properly, until the tension evens out,<br/>&gt; &gt; and ditto for the nut.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; On a piano, you play the note vigorously, and lift the<br/>&gt; tension on and off the pin.

Regardless of the system, these intervals have served<br/>&gt; &gt; as the bedrock point of departure in order to put forth all<br/>&gt; &gt; those imaginative approaches we have seen for centuries. The<br/>&gt; &gt; just intervals have been tuned and the only way some tuning<br/>&gt; &gt; have even been tuned is by tricks with counting beats and<br/>&gt; &gt; comparing it to clocks.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; This is quite removed from the process in which we deal with<br/>&gt; &gt; intervals in music.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I should clarify that while the main point of my reply to Carl<br/>&gt; was that the validity of my music and use of near-just versions<br/>&gt; of medieval Islamic and other ratios such as 14/13 or 13/8<br/>&gt; doesn&apos;t depend on the question of tunabllity by ear, that doesn&apos;t<br/>&gt; mean that I don&apos;t lean in your direction. The fact that I tune by<br/>&gt; synthesizer table makes me a bit caution in getting into this<br/>&gt; question, but even my imperfect hearing and digital musicmaking<br/>&gt; have taught me that these intervals and regions are significant.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Over the years, how high up the harmonic series one is &quot;supposed&quot;<br/>&gt; to be able to hear seems like a fashion statement subject to<br/>&gt; rising and falling trends, like hemlines. Thus one theory I<br/>&gt; recall from around a decade ago was that &quot;recognizable&quot; ratios or<br/>&gt; the like have ratios not greater than a*b=104. That &quot;rule&quot; of<br/>&gt; &quot;harmonic entropy&quot; was evidently devised at a time when 13/8 was<br/>&gt; in.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Other times 13/8 may be &quot;out,&quot; or even ratios of 11. I recall a<br/>&gt; discussion maybe a decade ago about whether I should really be<br/>&gt; describing 14/11 and 13/11 in rational terms.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; And still other times, people involved in the &quot;regular mapping&quot;<br/>&gt; approach have told me that it&apos;s possible to tune by ear at least<br/>&gt; up to 17:13, although adding that the fact that an interval is so<br/>&gt; tunable or &quot;recognizable&quot; doesn&apos;t mean that it necessarily will<br/>&gt; seem more consonant than surrounding intervals of the same<br/>&gt; region.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; What I know is that I can hear a difference between 14/13 and<br/>&gt; 13/12, which so nicely complement each other, as in Ibn Sina&apos;s<br/>&gt; tetrachord of 28:26:24:21 or, Ozan has suggested, 12:13:14:16.<br/>&gt; And George Secor taught me to take ratios of 11 and 13 very<br/>&gt; seriously.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; The real comedy is that we have vanguard research here into all<br/>&gt; kinds of commas and three-digit and four-digit EDO&apos;s, but<br/>&gt; something like 14/13 or 26/21 becomes an exemplar of<br/>&gt; &quot;psychoacoustically unfounded theory.&quot;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; That there are other intervals of great musical expressiveness<br/>&gt; &gt; is proven in countless examples around the world.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Yes, of course, with gamelan and &quot;equable heptaonic&quot; tunings of<br/>&gt; many shadings in Southeast Asia and Africa as one example.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; Still JI intervals will always hold a unique place.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; That;s how I feel, and I have a certain mixed feeling about<br/>&gt; tempering, often by not more than 2-3 cents, in order to get a<br/>&gt; chain of regular or near-regular fifths -- in O3, for example, at<br/>&gt; either 1 or 2 binary millioctaves wide (i.e. 1024-EDO). One main<br/>&gt; effect of the tempering is to get an apotome just shy of 14/13,<br/>&gt; and a diminished fourth, e.g. B-Eb, at a virtually just 26/21<br/>&gt; (370 cents), or sometimes Safi al-Din&apos;s 99/80 (369 cents).<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; And in something like Erv&apos;s 1-3-7-9-11-13 eikosony, I do get the<br/>&gt; just ratios as occurately as 1024-EDO will permit. And I know he<br/>&gt; hasn&apos;t been doctrinaire: he&apos;s done metaslendro, metameantone, and<br/>&gt; lots of systems both just and tempered.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; Partch could tune his 43 tone scale by ear, on instruments that<br/>&gt; &gt; often have extremely short durations. Some of these it was<br/>&gt; &gt; years before i actually heard some of the chords going on in<br/>&gt; &gt; his &apos;Delusion of the Fury&apos;. Most people are so used to these<br/>&gt; &gt; not being tuned they hear it as percussion and little more.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; In one book on Partch in my local University library I saw a<br/>&gt; diagram of a diamond going up to 17, if I remember correctly,<br/>&gt; including 17/14, one of my favorites, and neat for Turkish Maqam<br/>&gt; Segah.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; On the other hand I don&apos;t know of anyone who can get even marginally close to<br/>&gt; &gt; 11 or 13 ET or even 22 by ear.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I&apos;m recalling a post where you humorously suggested that 22 could<br/>&gt; be taken as a series of 32:31 steps. That was a reaction to the<br/>&gt; trend of viewpoint JI in term of some EDO.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; It would be unfair if i did not mention recurrent sequences of all having a<br/>&gt; &gt; special perceptible property that can be used to tune by paying attention to<br/>&gt; &gt; difference tones.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Maybe it would be a good exercise for me to see if I can become<br/>&gt; aware of and learn to recognize some of the difference tones that<br/>&gt; might arise in O3. Would 4:6:7 be a good place to start: at one<br/>&gt; location, A-E-F#*, it&apos;s around 0-703.1-960.0 cents? Or maybe<br/>&gt; something like 6:9:11, A-E-G* at 0-703.1-1048.8 cents?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; If I can learn to recognize different tones, and the temperament<br/>&gt; is accurate enough, maybe I could experience some &quot;near-just<br/>&gt; phenomena&quot; and feel more confident in these discussions.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Cameron wrote in response to Kraig:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;  Yes I agree- more than agree, because my personal experience<br/>&gt; &gt;  is that the simple proportions in the audible harmonic<br/>&gt; &gt;  spectrum exert very strong gravities.  Melodically as well-<br/>&gt; &gt;  last night I sang an ascending 7:6 two cents flat and a 5:4<br/>&gt; &gt;  one cent sharp (according to Adobe Audition pitch analysis,<br/>&gt; &gt;  that&apos;s some kind of averaging window of course), not on<br/>&gt; &gt;  purpose, wasn&apos;t even aiming for these intervals, but by<br/>&gt; &gt;  feeling the vibe of that JI... thing. I couldn&apos;t sing with<br/>&gt; &gt;  such accuracy &quot;on purpose&quot; if my life depended on it- it&apos;s<br/>&gt; &gt;  just going with the flow of a strong natural phenomenon.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Hi, Cameron.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Thanks for adding your experience, and also your comments about<br/>&gt; 11/9 and the importance of instrument-specific SHE.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; One question: do you find yourself singing at or near<br/>&gt; superparticular ratios for neutral or Zalzalian seconds like<br/>&gt; 14:13, 13:12, 12:11, and 11:10 (about which you posted in an<br/>&gt; article I&apos;m answering next)? I see no reason these shouldn&apos;t be<br/>&gt; recognizable with practice and a bit of stylistic familiarity,<br/>&gt; which you have. There&apos;s an example in Ozan&apos;s thesis that looks<br/>&gt; like 14:13:12 to him and me alike, and I&apos;ve heard that this<br/>&gt; division or 12:13:14 occurs in some other world musics.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Your baglama posts have really got me mobilized, and I really<br/>&gt; enjoyed your remark about being drawn to 11/7. This is my usual<br/>&gt; regular minor sixth, with my maqam tunings tending to support<br/>&gt; both 14/9 and 11/7 in some locations, and one or the other in<br/>&gt; lots more, although my 14/9&apos;s are notorious for getting tempered<br/>&gt; to 273/176&apos;s or the like about four or five cents narrower!<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; My musical abilities, however imperfect, do permit me to<br/>&gt; appreciate that Rast with a 16/13 and with a 26/21 are different<br/>&gt; flavors, and I like both. A few months ago, Ozan was talking<br/>&gt; about 370 cents as a historically prevant tuning of perde segah<br/>&gt; in Rast, and your baglama seems to have hit the spot.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; One point about ratios: I&apos;ve been told that luthiers still use<br/>&gt; the 16th-century &quot;Rule of 18&quot; to fret acoustically near-equal<br/>&gt; semitones, using a ratio of 18:17 which, when fretting physics<br/>&gt; comes into play, actually yields a more accurate 100 cents than<br/>&gt; the &quot;logarithmically correct&quot; spacing.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Why not a &quot;Rule of 14&quot; for the baglama or the like: for example,<br/>&gt; place the 4/3 fret in usual Pythagorean fashion, and then place<br/>&gt; the fret the third of Rast (perde segah) so as to add another<br/>&gt; 13th part in length, producing an interval of 14:13, or of 26/21<br/>&gt; from the 1/1?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I can easily see this kind of thing being handed down. Safi<br/>&gt; al-Din al-Urmawi&apos;s &quot;Medium Sundered&quot; tetrachord of<br/>&gt; 9/8-11/10-320/297 (which leads to my next intended post) shows<br/>&gt; another method for placing an almost identical segah fret.<br/>&gt; Tune a 9/8 in usual Pythagorean fashion (as your six-year-old sun<br/>&gt; might say, two soldierlies up and an octave down), and then place<br/>&gt; a fret spaced from this by 1/11 of the remaining length. We could<br/>&gt; call this a &quot;Rule of 11.&quot;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; The temperament issues you raise I&apos;ll get into with my next post,<br/>&gt; where I&apos;ll also ask some questions about the rest of the baglama<br/>&gt; tuning whose lowest tetrachord you&apos;ve posted -- but hopefully<br/>&gt; questions that won&apos;t require more measures, and might be<br/>&gt; approached largely on the basis of which fourths or fifths are<br/>&gt; pure or notably otherwise, etc.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; [Later note: having found that addressing your temperament<br/>&gt; questions produced a long post in itself, I will try to get to<br/>&gt; those baglama questions tomorrow.]<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; With many thanks,<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Margo<br/>&gt;</p></div><h3><a id=94338 href="#94338">ðŸ”—</a>Carl Lumma &#x3C;carl@...&#x3E;</h3><span>11/6/2010 7:34:52 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Hi Margo,</p><p>Just a few quick notes...</p><p>&gt; &gt;&gt;      (2) Some of these tunings are closely approximated by<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt; current tunings in practical use in various parts of<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt; the Near East;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; Seems likely, though the word &quot;closely&quot; can be troublesome.<br/>&gt; &gt; The central point I would stress is that we really don&apos;t have<br/>&gt; &gt; much idea what tunings are currently in use, because of a<br/>&gt; &gt; paucity of data.

For instance,<br/>&gt; &gt; choose a rational number R at random, num(R)*den(R) &lt; 10,000<br/>&gt; &gt; and 1 &lt; R &lt; 2.  Let&apos;s say 55/27.  What are the odds it is used<br/>&gt; &gt; systematically in maqam music (that is, it is the target of<br/>&gt; &gt; some bearing plan, fret placement instruction, vocal training<br/>&gt; &gt; regimen, etc, used by more than one musician... that<br/>&gt; &gt; musicians/craftsmen have some means of communicating about it,<br/>&gt; &gt; not necessarily by name, but in *some* fashion)?  Answer: the<br/>&gt; &gt; odds are low and we wouldn&apos;t believe this unless evidence was<br/>&gt; &gt; plainly extant, de novo, of such a bearing plan, fret placement<br/>&gt; &gt; instruction, etc. etc.<br/>[snip]<br/>&gt; These conceptual landmarks are useful to some of us -- not<br/>&gt; necessarily all of us, as you&apos;ve made clear! -- in themselves.<br/>&gt; Whether fretting schemes might favor these superparticular<br/>&gt; patterns more than nearby but distinguishable shadings, and<br/>&gt; whether flexible-pitch performers might be especially drawn to<br/>&gt; them, are open questions.</p><p>They&apos;re open in the sense that there&apos;s no data contradicting<br/>them, but closed in the sense that there is no particular<br/>reason to suspect they might be true... unless there is.<br/>For instance, Al-Farabi&apos;s instructions which Cameron recently<br/>linked to certainly point to 27/22 as a target of a lute<br/>fretting.  So that&apos;s the kind of thing I was asking for, and<br/>getting yelled at for asking for.  It&apos;s also in contrast to<br/>what we saw in some sources, where pitch-tracking data were<br/>fit to rationals, apparently arbitrarily (or at least without<br/>explanation).</p><p>&gt; Whether superparticular divisions such as 12:13:14 or 14:13:12<br/>&gt; and 11:12:13 or 13:12:11 have additionally have a special aural<br/>&gt; attraction for expert or other performers growing up in a maqam<br/>&gt; or dastgah tradition is an empirical question.</p><p>As I remarked, such triads, when played in the proper (rather<br/>high) register can sound special.  But I haven&apos;t heard them in<br/>maqam music.  Like I said, maybe I need to get out more, but if<br/>people are so sure they&apos;re there I would have expected links<br/>offered straight away.</p><p>&gt; This is a point that Owen Wright also makes. Cris has commented<br/>&gt; that an &quot;equable&quot; division like Ibn Sina&apos;s 14:13:12 or 12:13:14<br/>&gt; is the way of indicating a 7:6 third derived from two near-equal<br/>&gt; steps.</p><p>They are equal in terms of distance on the fretboard, so it&apos;s<br/>entirely possible such a division would arise even if it&apos;s<br/>never played as a triad.  Of course that supposes the 7:6 is<br/>tuned with some accuracy to start with, which again, I&apos;ve never<br/>heard stand out in maqam music.</p><p>&gt; Whether Near Eastern musicians are aurally drawn, or drawn by<br/>&gt; instrument designs, to superparticular divisions vis-a-vis<br/>&gt; comparably shaded geometric or unequal but not rationally<br/>&gt; conceived divisions is an open question, and I&apos;m open to a<br/>&gt; range of results, interpretations, and answers.</p><p>I&apos;m open to a range of them too.  However let&apos;s not paper<br/>over the fact that some folks are engaged in number games,<br/>and probably have been for a long time.</p><p>&gt; First, tunability or recognizability or reproducibility by ear<br/>&gt; might depend a lot on the cultural background and training of<br/>&gt; the musicians involved.</p><p>Is there any evidence maqam musicians train to hear harmonics<br/>like 11?  I mean, it just flies in the face of everything I know<br/>about the practice of maqam music (not that I know very much).</p><p>&gt; If you&apos;re referring to the commercialization of traditional<br/>&gt; cultures and arts, complete with health and asserted other<br/>&gt; marketing claims, and sometimes with totally fictional accounts<br/>&gt; presented as actual ethnographic data, then we&apos;re in agreement<br/>&gt; with lots of people in those cultures.</p><p>To me it&apos;s no better than the proverbial late colonial-era<br/>musician reporting that X musical tradition uses a cheap<br/>imitation of 12-ET, so often maligned by the very people who...</p><p>&gt; What I hope is that you&apos;re referring to a hypothetical case which<br/>&gt; happily has not arisen in the list&apos;s present colloquies on maqam<br/>&gt; and dastgah music and tuning, whatever our differences of view.</p><p>I will refrain from mentioning names at this time.</p><p>&gt; Of course, it&apos;s possible for honest and respectful analyses to<br/>&gt; be theoretically overzealous or simply wrong, and respectful<br/>&gt; questioning or outright correction, always I would hope<br/>&gt; constructive and polite, is an appropriate response. This<br/>&gt; discussion I take to be in that spirit, whatever the merits of<br/>&gt; our respective positions.</p><p>The archives tell the story of who escalated where.<br/>But I&apos;m no angel when provoked and I should work harder<br/>at that.</p><p>&gt; Certainly we agree that 12-ET/EDO can serve as either a<br/>&gt; modification of Pythagorean tuning (possibly its original<br/>&gt; application in 15th-century Italy, as suggested by Mark Lindley,<br/>&gt; permitting the same lute fret to be used as a diatonic or<br/>&gt; chromatic semitone) or as the upper limit of the meantone zone;<br/>&gt; and that adaptive JI is an attractive paradigm for 16th-century<br/>&gt; vocal music, for example, especially if one wants to avoid comma<br/>&gt; drift.</p><p>I agree.  Though if one really wants the edginess of<br/>Pythagorean (e.g. on the organ), 12ET will tend to disappoint.</p><p>&gt; A point worthy of quick mention is that problems involving the<br/>&gt; syntonic comma are specific to forms of Western music based on<br/>&gt; 5-limit consonances starting around the 15th century (and at<br/>&gt; least a couple of centuries earlier in some English styles), in<br/>&gt; contrast to medieval polyphony based on a Pythagorean outlook.</p><p>Yes, of course.</p><p>&gt; Another point is that for many people on this list, the Western<br/>&gt; composers and styles presenting &quot;the exception that proves the<br/>&gt; rule&quot; would be main points of interest: for example Marchettus<br/>&gt; and his expressive variations on Pythagorean intonation which<br/>&gt; modern performers such as Christopher Page have seen as relevant<br/>&gt; to much 13th-14th century French and Italian music; and, of<br/>&gt; course, Vicentino, Colonna, and also Gesualdo in the later 16th<br/>&gt; and early 17th centuries.</p><p>Musica reservata certainly is an exception.  I assume you&apos;ve<br/>heard the latest stuff being done by Jon Wild, etc?  (Sorry,<br/>but I can&apos;t remember if you were involved in the thread<br/>regarding the recent BBC radio documentary...)</p><p>You may not know, but over the years I&apos;ve made extensive use of<br/>your excellent reviews of recordings.  That was back when one<br/>purchased CDs! and such decisions were always taken carefully.</p><p>&gt; &gt; I wasn&apos;t alive yet in 1976 but I too first heard this<br/>&gt; &gt; particular piece on probably that very same King&apos;s Singers<br/>&gt; &gt; recording.  It sounded completely normal until I tried<br/>&gt; &gt; to learn the parts.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; That&apos;s interesting! I wonder how I might react approaching it at<br/>&gt; that level. And it&apos;s humorous how I envisioned you as being<br/>&gt; closer to my age, a healthy reminder for me that there are newer<br/>&gt; generations. Maybe my misconception that you were around my age<br/>&gt; came from the idea of you as &quot;my fellow Berzerkleyan&quot; -- when I<br/>&gt; lived in San Francisco, I often visited Berkeley.</p><p>You&apos;re in the Sacremento area now?  Alas, I&apos;m no longer in<br/>Berkeley, having moved to the San Jose area in 2006.  As much<br/>as I dislike some aspects of the suburban life here, it has<br/>some considerable advantages in the raising children dept.</p><p>But yeah, I found myself always singing the F#, as it were.<br/>I could do with a much better dose of modal intelligence.<br/>I am always in awe of jazz artists in this respect.  Say,<br/>have you heard the recordings the Orlando consort did with<br/>that jazz group... Perfect Houseplants?</p><p>&gt; Glad you like it. I&apos;m not sure if it illustrates similar points<br/>&gt; to the ones you were discussing about tonality and modality.</p><p>When my sore throat recovers I&apos;ll attempt to sing it and<br/>let you know!</p><p>-Carl</p></div><h3><a id=94344 href="#94344">ðŸ”—</a>Chris Vaisvil &#x3C;chrisvaisvil@...&#x3E;</h3><span>11/7/2010 6:29:00 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>I also concur.</p><p>On Wed, Nov 3, 2010 at 10:41 PM, robert_inventor5<br/>&lt;robertwalker@...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Good point, Kraig, just bumping this in case anyone missed it, not much to reply except to say I agree!<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Robert<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; I have been enjoying and concurring about what you are saying Robert.<br/>&gt; I think one difference in the arts is often one comes up with theories afterwards in order to explain phenomenon to themselves.<br/>&gt; This is true of quite a few composers i can think of who just write music and &quot;justify &quot; it later.<br/>&gt; Being in such a science heavy society, i think many artist feel they have to explain their actions or directions.<br/>&gt; Which i think is unfortunate.</p></div><h3><a id=94358 href="#94358">ðŸ”—</a>Margo Schulter &#x3C;mschulter@...&#x3E;</h3><span>11/7/2010 7:58:57 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>&gt; Hi Margo,</p><p>&gt; Just a few quick notes...</p><p>Hi, Carl.</p><p>To keep this a bit briefer, I&apos;ll snip a bit of our last rounds<br/>of comments quoted in your message.

If so, I<br/>must admit that over the better part of nine years in exploring<br/>these _melodic_ divisions and some tempered variations, it had<br/>never occurred to me to assume that all three notes would be<br/>played at once.</p><p>Rather, I would think of something like Ibn Sina&apos;s 12:13:14:16<br/>(if that&apos;s his original tetrachord, as suggested by Ozan) as<br/>above all a _melodic_ division, meant to be enjoyed in monophonic<br/>music. I wouldn&apos;t assume any kind of harmony, although a drone,<br/>for example, might bring out the vertical attraction of 7/6 or<br/>4/3; and Ibn Sina describes a technique, called a _tarqib_ or<br/>&quot;mixture,&quot; of sometimes playing two simultaneous notes at a<br/>consonant interval such as a 4:3 fourth or 3:2 fifth, a bit as in<br/>improvised medieval European organum or diaphony. (More often, I<br/>should note, the term _tarqib_ in maqam theory refers to a<br/>&quot;mixed&quot; or &quot;composite&quot; maqam seen to be derived from two or more<br/>simpler maqamat.)</p><p>In fact, in learning or exploring a maqam, I find it helpful to<br/>start in and often return to a monophonic framework, even though<br/>polyphony is indeed of great interest to me. When superparticular<br/>steps like 14:13, 13:12, 12:11, and 11:10 are discussed, I think<br/>of them in a traditional maqam/dastgah context as above all<br/>melodic.</p><p>In 21st-century &quot;Zalzalian polyphony,&quot; a division like 12:13:14<br/>can also take on a vertical or harmonic aspect -- but not, at<br/>least in my practice so far, that of a simultaneous triad. Rather<br/>we have in such a new practice -- and not necessarily in any<br/>medieval or current Near Eastern practice!! -- progressions like<br/>this, using numbers of harmonics and then ratio notations:</p><p>        14  13         7/6  13/12<br/>        12  13    or   1/1  13/12</p><p>Here the two voices start at a 7/6 minor third, with one voice<br/>ascending by 13:12 and the other descending by 14:13 so as to<br/>resolve to a unison. And we can get a subtly different melodic<br/>and contrapuntal quality by having the same vertical intervals<br/>and melodic steps, but with 14:13 ascending and 13:12 descending:</p><p>        7/6   14/13<br/>        1/1   14/13</p><p>And lest things take on too much of a &quot;purist&quot; or &quot;rationals<br/>only!&quot; atmosphere, please let me rush to add that I do temper,<br/>for example in O3 versions of these progressions:</p><p>       B* 264.8   Bb* 138.2         G* 264.8   F# 126.6<br/>       A    0     Bb* 138.2   or    F    0     F# 126.6</p><p>That said, I would emphasize my understanding that medieval<br/>divisions like 14:13:12, and likewise Ptolemy&apos;s earlier Equable<br/>Diatonic at 12:11:10:9, are above all melodic phenomena, although<br/>they may have very interesting polyphonic and contrapuntal<br/>ramifications in a modern context that I see as quite apart from<br/>the traditional Near Eastern styles that we&apos;re discussing.</p><p>&gt;&gt; This is a point that Owen Wright also makes. Cris has<br/>&gt;&gt; commented that an &quot;equable&quot; division like Ibn Sina&apos;s 14:13:12<br/>&gt;&gt; or 12:13:14 is the way of indicating a 7:6 third derived from<br/>&gt;&gt; two near-equal steps.</p><p>&gt; They are equal in terms of distance on the fretboard, so it&apos;s<br/>&gt; entirely possible such a division would arise even if it&apos;s<br/>&gt; never played as a triad.  Of course that supposes the 7:6 is<br/>&gt; tuned with some accuracy to start with, which again, I&apos;ve never<br/>&gt; heard stand out in maqam music.</p><p>Just to make it clear, because I realize that lots of people may<br/>be oriented to chordal genres of music and music theory to the<br/>degree that misunderstandings are very easy: I might expect to<br/>hear something like 12:13:14 or 14:13:12 often played as a<br/>melodic figure in a relevant medieval or later Near Eastern<br/>context, but not as a simultaneous triad. In fact, what I have in<br/>mind is a basically monophonic setting where fine distinctions of<br/>melodic tuning may be appreciated without the distractions of<br/>vertical events such as those I sometimes use in my maqam<br/>improvisations.</p><p>As to 7:6, I&apos;d say there&apos;s very strong evidence that the general<br/>region is vital to Turkish and Persian styles, at least, but the<br/>precise ratio may be a moot question. As we&apos;ve discussed,<br/>variability and nuance make any assertion of a precise rational<br/>ratio a hazardous undertaking -- and likewise for any EDO model.</p><p>For example, Karl Signell found that the tuning of a theoretical<br/>12-comma step on Necdet Yasar&apos;s tanbur was in the range of<br/>270-273 cents, which I would say is close to 7/6 (267 cents), but<br/>actually in the slightly higher range of the advertised 12-comma<br/>interval, which Cris Forster calls a &quot;triple limma,&quot; about 271<br/>cents in a Pythagorean context (15 fourths down, or thrice<br/>256/243 at 90.225 cents), and 271.70 cents in 53-EDO.</p><p>This is in Signell&apos;s classic _Makam: Modal Practice in Turkish<br/>Art Music_, Appendix A. I should note that Signell takes a<br/>special interest in intervals, especially neutral or middle<br/>ones, that don&apos;t fit in with the Turkish AEU scheme -- although<br/>the triple limma at 12 commas happens to be one that does.</p><p>And Beyhom measures a Turkish performance of another flavor of<br/>Hijaz at 130-265-90 cents. Here the central interval of 265 cents<br/>is just narrow of 7/6, and 6 or 7 cents so of a triple limma or<br/>literal 12 commas (Pythagorean or 53-EDO).</p><p>Thus these flexible-pitch performances and tanbur tunings are<br/>certainly in the &quot;ballpark&quot; of 7/6, but not always necessarily<br/>aimed at precisely that ratio, and sometimes in fact consistently<br/>aimed at the slightly higher goal of 12 commas. Those of us who<br/>might aim for 7/6 aren&apos;t &quot;wrong,&quot; but we aren&apos;t uniquely right,<br/>either.</p><p>&gt;&gt; Whether Near Eastern musicians are aurally drawn, or drawn by<br/>&gt;&gt; instrument designs, to superparticular divisions vis-a-vis &gt;<br/>&gt;&gt; comparably shaded geometric or unequal but not rationally &gt;<br/>&gt;&gt; conceived divisions is an open question, and I&apos;m open to a &gt;<br/>&gt;&gt; range of results, interpretations, and answers.</p><p>&gt; I&apos;m open to a range of them too.  However let&apos;s not paper over<br/>&gt; the fact that some folks are engaged in number games, and<br/>&gt; probably have been for a long time.</p><p>Who on the tuning list, at least among people who get into<br/>analyses or theories of some kind, _isn&apos;t_ involved in &quot;numbers<br/>games&quot; of one kind or another? Can we really do the regular<br/>mapping paradigm or harmonic entropy without numbers?</p><p>In fact, I&apos;d say that music is one of the four disciplines of the<br/>quadrivium, along with arithmetic, geometry, and astronomy. We&apos;re<br/>dealing with &quot;multitudes&quot; (i.e. integer ratios), and also<br/>&quot;magnitudes&quot; (e.g. logarithmic measures such as cents).</p><p>When Ozan records his analysis of a performance in Maqam Ushshaq<br/>as using a measured tetrachord of around 123-137-228 cents, and<br/>he and I agree that &quot;12:13:14:16&quot; is an approximate although not<br/>precise evocation of this tuning, then we&apos;re playing at the game<br/>of seeking connections and seeking to understand, with this RI<br/>model as one possible viewpoint.</p><p>&gt;&gt; First, tunability or recognizability or reproducibility by ear<br/>&gt;&gt; might depend a lot on the cultural background and training of<br/>&gt;&gt; the musicians involved.</p><p>&gt; Is there any evidence maqam musicians train to hear harmonics<br/>&gt; like 11?  I mean, it just flies in the face of everything I<br/>&gt; know about the practice of maqam music (not that I know very<br/>&gt; much).</p><p>My own initial hypothesis might not focus on tuning by audible<br/>harmonics, but rather on superparticular frettings like 12:11,<br/>which might influence as well as be influenced by the fine<br/>melodic taste of flexible-pitch performers in a primarily<br/>monophonic context.</p><p>What I&apos;d predict is that we may find very fine degrees of melodic<br/>pitch discrimination in a range of world musics, fine shadings<br/>and nuances which make sense in purely melodic terms, whether or<br/>whatever degree they may coincide with superparticular steps like<br/>11:10, 12:11, 13:12, 14:13, and so forth.</p><p>As to tuning by audible harmonics, I&apos;d want to check out the<br/>practices of traditional musicians very carefully before drawing<br/>conclusions. The fact that Jean During seems to recommend using<br/>the audible 13th harmonic in tuning a small Persian neutral sixth<br/>at 13/8 doesn&apos;t necessarily mean that traditional Persian or<br/>other Iranian musicians necessarily prefer 13/8 or tune it in<br/>this fashion, although its favored position in Ibn Sina&apos;s &grave;oud<br/>tuning would make me ask if there might be any connection. My<br/>guess is that a small Persian neutral sixth might typically have<br/>a range of something like 830-845 cents, which would include Ibn<br/>Sina&apos;s ratio of 13/8 (841 cents), and also 21/13 (830 cents)<br/>found in a mode based on his tetrachord of 12:13:14:16 or<br/>28:26:24:21 (the second reading shown in avicenna_diat.scl in the<br/>Scala scale archive, with Ozan favoring the first).</p><p>The fact that these classic ratios are included within the range,<br/>however, doesn&apos;t mean that they&apos;re uniquely favored in modern<br/>Iranian music. Finding out what kind of distribution of sizes for<br/>neutral sixths might occur in practice, and also whether<br/>traditional musicians do sometimes use audible harmonics in<br/>tuning, would be very worthwhile.</p><p>&gt;&gt; If you&apos;re referring to the commercialization of traditional<br/>&gt;&gt; cultures and arts, complete with health and asserted other<br/>&gt;&gt; marketing claims, and sometimes with totally fictional<br/>&gt;&gt; accounts presented as actual ethnographic data, then we&apos;re in<br/>&gt;&gt; agreement with lots of people in those cultures.</p><p>&gt; To me it&apos;s no better than the proverbial late colonial-era<br/>&gt; musician reporting that X musical tradition uses a cheap<br/>&gt; imitation of 12-ET, so often maligned by the very people who...</p><p>Yes, if someone were taking, or rather inventing, some extraneous<br/>scale or &quot;ancient spiritual tradition&quot; and using it to market<br/>&quot;Mystical Anatolian Chimes&quot; supposedly based on &quot;the wisdom of<br/>the ancient Greek, Chaldean, Egyptian, and Hebrew sages as still<br/>practiced today in Turkey, the path to instantly improved<br/>physical health and spiritual enlightenment.&quot;</p><p>But I don&apos;t see anyone on this list doing that, people oriented<br/>to JI/RI or others.</p><p>&gt;&gt; What I hope is that you&apos;re referring to a hypothetical case<br/>&gt;&gt; which happily has not arisen in the list&apos;s present colloquies<br/>&gt;&gt; on maqam and dastgah music and tuning, whatever our<br/>&gt;&gt; differences of view.</p><p>&gt; I will refrain from mentioning names at this time.</p><p>Happily, I haven&apos;t seen the type of cultural exploitation you&apos;re<br/>describing -- not on this list, that is.</p><p>What I do see is mostly the antithesis, whether people exploring<br/>Near Eastern music (including some Near Eastern musicians) are<br/>focusing on JI/RI concepts of the medieval theorists, or on other<br/>kinds of approaches.</p><p>&gt;&gt; Of course, it&apos;s possible for honest and respectful analyses to<br/>&gt;&gt; be theoretically overzealous or simply wrong, and respectful &gt;<br/>&gt;&gt; questioning or outright correction, always I would hope &gt;<br/>&gt;&gt; constructive and polite, is an appropriate response. This &gt;<br/>&gt;&gt; discussion I take to be in that spirit, whatever the merits of<br/>&gt;&gt; &gt; our respective positions.</p><p>&gt; The archives tell the story of who escalated where.  But I&apos;m no<br/>&gt; angel when provoked and I should work harder at that.</p><p>Certainly I hope that we&apos;ll all strive to follow &quot;the better<br/>angels of our nature,&quot; and agree that you have undoubtedly been<br/>the target of uncivil, unwarranted, and totally counterproductive<br/>personal attacks. That&apos;s a cycle of escalation I want to help<br/>break, definitively if possible.</p><p>And likewise, it may promote de-escalation, rhetorical and<br/>otherwise, to reach a mutual understanding that people here,<br/>however much we differ on the theory and sometimes on an accurate<br/>reading of relevant facts, are acting in good faith and respect<br/>for the traditions being explored and analyzed, however aptly or<br/>otherwise.</p><p>As I suspect Ozan or Amine Beyhom or Karl Signell would quickly<br/>agree, almost everything in this area of empirical measurements<br/>remains to be done! But I&apos;d see it as an honorable, culturally<br/>respectful, endeavor, and that includes the use of medieval or<br/>other Near Eastern theory, not some arbitrary imposition of<br/>outsiders but an ornament of the tradition itself.</p><p>[On 12-EDO as a substitute for Pythagorean when playing in<br/>medieval European styles]</p><p>&gt; I agree.  Though if one really wants the edginess of<br/>&gt; Pythagorean (e.g. on the organ), 12ET will tend to disappoint.</p><p>It&apos;s curious that I tend, in tuning systems mean for medieval<br/>European as well as maqam/dastgah music, to temper about the same<br/>amount as in 12-EDO, but in the &quot;more interesting direction&quot;!<br/>And this, too, is a distortion of the original Pythagorean<br/>framework, however &quot;gentle&quot; I would like to envision it.</p><p>Where it would get into obvious problems is with early<br/>15th-century music, where near-5-limit schismatic thirds for<br/>sonorities involving written sharps (played as Pythagorean flats,<br/>e.g. written A-C# realized as A-Db at 384 cents) are a basic<br/>feature of the intended performance, with keyboard tunings like<br/>Gb-B or maybe Db-F# promoting that ideal. Neither my choice of an<br/>Eb-G# range, nor my deliberate temperament to get things like<br/>diminished fourths at 370 cents and augmented seconds at 334<br/>cents -- in contrast to 384 and 318 cents -- is a formula for<br/>success with the Faenza Codex or Buxheim Organ Book; or for<br/>Dufay&apos;s music very likely presuming a similar kind of tuning (as<br/>Mark Lindley has persuasively argued).</p><p>For 14th-century Italian music, say, where an augmented or<br/>diminished interval is evidently meant to be a moment of striking<br/>color rather than of notably smooth consonance, having a<br/>momentary F-C# at 830 cents rather than 816 cents might be fine,<br/>and in fact it&apos;s exactly what could have happened in a Marchettan<br/>type of style where sharps tend to be sung rather higher than<br/>Pythagorean.</p><p>[On &quot;exceptions that prove the rule&quot; as to 12-EDO as an<br/>approximation of medieval-Romantic European styles]</p><p>&gt; Musica reservata certainly is an exception.  I assume you&apos;ve<br/>&gt; heard the latest stuff being done by Jon Wild, etc?  (Sorry,<br/>&gt; but I can&apos;t remember if you were involved in the thread<br/>&gt; regarding the recent BBC radio documentary...)</p><p>Yes, I&apos;ve heard one incredible performance of a madrigal or the<br/>like by Vicentino, and would be very interested in learning about<br/>the BBC documentary.</p><p>&gt; You may not know, but over the years I&apos;ve made extensive use of<br/>&gt; your excellent reviews of recordings.  That was back when one<br/>&gt; purchased CDs! and such decisions were always taken carefully.</p><p>Giving credit where credit is due, I&apos;d want to make it very clear<br/>that those reviews are by Todd McComb and others at<br/><a href="http://www.medieval.org">www.medieval.org</a>, the site of the Medieval Music and Arts<br/>Foundation which he edits. While I&apos;ve contributed some articles<br/>on theory there, I don&apos;t recall contributing any CD reviews, but<br/>agree that these reviews and other discography material are an<br/>absolutely invaluable resource!</p><p>So while I&apos;m flattered to be associated with the site, and would<br/>warmly agree that the record and CD reviews are among its most<br/>valuable offerings, I&apos;d want to emphasize that the credit goes to<br/>others. And you&apos;ve given me a good reminder that I&apos;ve been out of<br/>touch with some of the folks responsible for the reviews, and<br/>should try to remedy this.</p><p>And you also reminded me of Joseph Spencer and his program which<br/>I heard around the beginning of the 1990&apos;s on KPFA (easier to get<br/>in Sacramento then than now, as far as I know). I&apos;m not sure if I<br/>ever visited The Musical Offering, but those programs were<br/>something else again!</p><p>&gt; You&apos;re in the Sacramento area now?  Alas, I&apos;m no longer in<br/>&gt; Berkeley, having moved to the San Jose area in 2006.  As much<br/>&gt; as I dislike some aspects of the suburban life here, it has<br/>&gt; some considerable advantages in the raising children dept.</p><p>My move to Sacramento was in 1984, and I was very fortunate to<br/>find an apartment building near California State University,<br/>Sacramento (CSUS) with a very reasonable library. At the time I<br/>playfully called it my &quot;rustification,&quot; and have been quite happy<br/>since with this location.</p><p>&gt; But yeah, I found myself always singing the F#, as it were.  I<br/>&gt; could do with a much better dose of modal intelligence.  I am<br/>&gt; always in awe of jazz artists in this respect.  Say, have you<br/>&gt; heard the recordings the Orlando consort did with that jazz<br/>&gt; group... Perfect Houseplants?</p><p>This I&apos;ll need to hear. One of my favorite jazz albums is _Kinda<br/>Blue_ by Miles Davis.</p><p>&gt;&gt; Glad you like it.

Regardless of what kind of music, I feel that notation should only define pitch to the point at which you&apos;d prefer to have the perfomer make their own choice.</p><p>Obviously for music which has as part of its very essence extreme precision in pitch is going to need extreme precision in notation- or something that effects extreme precision.</p><p>But, it is precisely such music which rarely presents a problem in notation, for such music is often electronically synthesized, in which case specification of pitch to microscopic precision is downright trivial, and the &quot;score&quot; is often computer code anyway, such that &quot;reading the score&quot; and producing the music are the same act. And, the score of acoustic music which has as a prequisite radical precision of pitch definition often assumes, in practice, the actual instruments upon which it is performed. This is similar to the tradition of the gamelan- and of the pianoforte in &quot;atonal&quot; music for that matter. An example of this would be acoustic pieces and repertoires with very specific pitch requirements such as proportionate beating.</p><p>In general though, I feel that notation should leave room for intonational interpretation. If specific intonation or purpose-built tuning is desired, then pitch references- electronic, monochord, marimba- should be included with the score. But the score itself should only have very specific pitch indications when necessary.</p><p>Where the line of &quot;specific&quot; pitch is drawn is surely a matter of an agreement, not, in real life, necessarily amicable or bilateral, between composer and performers.</p><p>Of course, temperament, or the deliberate acceptance of small commas, is necessary if the approach is to create new chord progressions by tempering out, or tempering out in effect, unusual commas. It is not necessary for circulation- unless your standard of circulation requires literal or near-literal transpositions of specific pitch combinations.</p><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, Margo Schulter &lt;mschulter@...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; [Dear Cameron: In what follows I address some temeperament<br/>&gt; questions and some of the tetrachords you discuss, as well as a<br/>&gt; couple of others that might illustrate some related comma<br/>&gt; questions.

And the kind of tuning or temperament system will reflect<br/>&gt; both the medieval Islamic and more recent tetrachords in use, and<br/>&gt; the logic of a given polyphonic style. That can mean creative<br/>&gt; compromises in various directions -- and often dramatically<br/>&gt; different ones for different people and styles.</p><p>&gt;<br/>&gt; Thus for Ozan, &quot;polyphony&quot; often means a desire for thirds at or<br/>&gt; close to 5/4 -- or ideally a tad lower, by the schisma of Safi<br/>&gt; al-Din al-Urmawi and the 24-note Pythgorean model of AEU, or<br/>&gt; maybe around 382 cents, as suggested in one of his posts. Since<br/>&gt; Ozan also wants an optional meantone path to that Rast third near<br/>&gt; 5/4, he uses a 79/80-MOS very close to 159-EDO, with some fifths<br/>&gt; tempered by 1/3 Holderian comma or 1/159 octave while others<br/>&gt; remain literally pure (by minute modifications to 159-EDO) or<br/>&gt; virtually pure. There are both schismatic and meantone paths to<br/>&gt; that 5/4 region, and the temperament of some fifths by over 7<br/>&gt; cents (a bit more than in 19-EDO) is the necessary and logical<br/>&gt; compromise to achieve that goal.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; For me, &quot;polyphony&quot; means adopting 13th-14th century European<br/>&gt; techniques to a maqam context rich with its Zalzalian steps and<br/>&gt; intervals. In 13th-14th century music of Continental Europe,<br/>&gt; based mostly on Pythagorean intonation, fifths and fourths are<br/>&gt; the stable consonances, with thirds and sixths more or less<br/>&gt; relatively concordant but complex and unstable, seeking<br/>&gt; resolution to unisons, fifths, or octaves, for example. So<br/>&gt; neutral thirds at various ratios fit in nicely. And something<br/>&gt; like 26/21 is especially dilectable, because 370 cents is like a<br/>&gt; &quot;Zalzalian ditone&quot; with the same kind of pleasant complexity as<br/>&gt; 14/11 at 418 cents, for example.</p><p>&gt;<br/>&gt; These are two different worlds. In Ozan&apos;s, 5/4 and 6/5 are needed<br/>&gt; both as fitting one side of current Turkish maqam practice which<br/>&gt; might be traced back at least to the 17-note Pythagorean<br/>&gt; &quot;Systematist&quot; theory of the 13th century (and I believe Cris<br/>&gt; shows to further back than that), and to meet the needs of his<br/>&gt; polyphonic style using 5-limit consonances.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; In mine, the emphasis is on ratios of 2-3-7-11-13, and any<br/>&gt; occurrences of 5/4 or 6/5 approximations are more or less<br/>&gt; incidental, rather than a basic or intended feature of a<br/>&gt; neomedieval system. The rules of counterpoint can apply to<br/>&gt; general categories of intervals: for example, &quot;a major, minor, or<br/>&gt; Zalzalian third often tends to contract to a unison or expand to<br/>&gt; a fifth.&quot;</p><p>My principal tuning is based on ratios of 2-3-7-13, with a handful of inevitable incidental near-11 ratios occuring. By near-11, an example would be that of a 16/13 above 4/3 differind from a 12/11 above 3/2 by a touch less than 5 cents. If there is indeed a pull exerted by successive superparticular intervals, it would be reasonable to assume that I&apos;d sharp the Ad when going F-G-Ad, and reasonable, given my thoughts on tempering for notation, to temper out the 352/351 between 128/117 and 12711 (128/117 being the ratio of illusory &quot;complexity&quot; which arises between G and Ad when Ad is a 16/13 above F, F and G being Pythagorean here of course).</p><p>&gt;<br/>&gt; Furthermore, Ozan for his purposes needs an option for a<br/>&gt; circulating 12-note chromatic scale to permit compatibility with<br/>&gt; Western music based on a 12-note well-temperament or 12-EDO, one<br/>&gt; of the design principles of his 79/80-MOS. What I need is<br/>&gt; compatibility with 13th-14th century European style based on<br/>&gt; Pythagoran intonation, of which I see a single 12-note keyboard<br/>&gt; in O3 as a gentle modification, with an Eb-G# chain of fifths<br/>&gt; tempered in 1024-EDO at an average of around 703.871 cents.</p><p>I believe that we discussed this long ago- the slightly sharp fifths are to my ears &quot;more real than real&quot;, given the concept of a fifth as bright or &quot;soldierly&quot;. Of course they are wrong when the concept of a fifth is a soft meantone-style interval. With instruments of flexible pitch, I would speculate that the fifth is also often modified minutely depending on context- mellow here, pure there, brilliant elsewhere.</p><p>Well I&apos;ll have to comment further at a later date!</p><p>-Cameron Bobro</p><p>&gt;<br/>&gt; And temperament is an essential ingredient for both of us. Thus<br/>&gt; on Ozan&apos;s 79/80-tone qanun, we have a suggested Rast (following<br/>&gt; his thesis, p. 118(, of 0-196-392-498 cents, with the major third<br/>&gt; being formed from two meantone steps of 196 cents. As he notes,<br/>&gt; it is possible to spell this tetrachord simply C-D-E-F.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; While temperament gets Ozan his meantone path to a near-5/4, it<br/>&gt; gets me my &quot;neo-Systematist&quot; path to neutral or Zalzalian<br/>&gt; intervals found within a single 12-note keyboard, for example in<br/>&gt; a Rast tetrachord like B-C#-Eb-E at 0-207-369-496 cents or<br/>&gt; 207-162-127 cents. Note that on a Pythagorean keyboard, this same<br/>&gt; spelling would result in a schismatic tetrachord of 0-204-384-498<br/>&gt; cents, or 204-180-114 cents. These &quot;schismatic&quot; mappings thus<br/>&gt; generate on each of the two 12-note keyboards the smallest and<br/>&gt; largest neutral intervals, for example steps near 14:13 and<br/>&gt; 11:10, while combining notes from the two keyboards (spaced at<br/>&gt; 57.422 cents) produces central neutral intervals like steps near<br/>&gt; 13:12 and 12:11.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Here I don&apos;t want to get too enmeshed in the mechanics of the<br/>&gt; 79/80-MOS, on which Ozan is of course the expert, and O3, but to<br/>&gt; give some idea of how polyphonic styles can vary and influence<br/>&gt; tuning systems to move in different directions while still<br/>&gt; sharing common themes like a desire for accurate representations<br/>&gt; of superparticular middle seconds.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; It&apos;s clear from simply listening to various maqam musics that<br/>&gt; &gt; the Pythagorean skeletal structures and the simplest of<br/>&gt; &gt; intervals are not sacrosanct- the melodic step is very<br/>&gt; &gt; powerful. Farhat is very big on this. For the creating of a<br/>&gt; &gt; practical system of non-infinite scope- like tuning a qanun-<br/>&gt; &gt; this surely creates a serious problem. If it&apos;s true that<br/>&gt; &gt; microtonal inflections along the lines of, say, a &quot;fourth&quot; at<br/>&gt; &gt; 515 cents (remembered from tuning up to jam along with a video<br/>&gt; &gt; on YouTube) are essential characteristics, the magnitude of the<br/>&gt; &gt; problem of where to temper is clearly immense.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; If circulation isn&apos;t a consideration, which it certainly isn&apos;t in<br/>&gt; traditional Iranian music or Farhat&apos;s 17-note tar tuning, then<br/>&gt; &quot;odd&quot; fourths and fifths can be a strength. For example, in the<br/>&gt; 24-note O3 temperament, we have a location where the closest<br/>&gt; available fourth is 485 cents -- almost identical, as I learned<br/>&gt; in a book by Nelly Caron and Dariouche Safvate, to a 484-cent<br/>&gt; fourth used in a traditional tuning of a beautiful dastgah or<br/>&gt; avaz (a satellite dastgah to the principal seven) known as the<br/>&gt; Old Bayat-e Tork. They give 0-204-346-484-704-908-980-1200<br/>&gt; cents.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; More generally, the Iranian taste for septimal or near-septimal<br/>&gt; intervals means that we&apos;re not going to get a tidy 17-note<br/>&gt; circulating system on tar. Caron and Safvate, on the basis of<br/>&gt; measuring one or more instruments, give a Shur tetrachord at<br/>&gt; 0-136-276-500 cents or 136-140-224 cents. A large tone that close<br/>&gt; to 8:7 means that we can expect at least one notably narrow<br/>&gt; fourth of the kind found in the &quot;Old Tork&quot; above.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; In O3, we have 24 positions and 22 of them with usual fifths at<br/>&gt; 703.1 or 704.3 cents -- the &quot;odd&quot; two at G#-Eb* (an asterisk<br/>&gt; showing a note on the upper keyboard) with a 714.8-cent fifth,<br/>&gt; and G#*-E at 726.6 cents, or close to 32/21. And there are a<br/>&gt; number of locations with a choice between 4/3 or 21/16, something<br/>&gt; George Secor has taught me to relish, and nice for doing<br/>&gt; different interpretations of Maqam &grave;Iraq (some Syrians favor a<br/>&gt; fourth at 21 commas or around 475 cents, realized at 472 or 473<br/>&gt; cents in this temperament).<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; For Ozan, it _is_ vital to circulate, and he&apos;s made some<br/>&gt; intricate and delicate compromises to do so while supporting lots<br/>&gt; of neutral or Zalzalian flavors, among many other things.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; I don&apos;t face this problem personally, as I simply use pure, or<br/>&gt; &gt; plainly altered.  This (using either pure or plainly altered)<br/>&gt; &gt; is, in my opinion, the only real option in a limited system<br/>&gt; &gt; that is not attempting to shoulder a huge burden.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Yes, and the &quot;limited system&quot; concept certainly applies to O3<br/>&gt; with only 24 notes. Not being concerned with either circulation<br/>&gt; or the syntonic comma simplifies lots of things, and means a<br/>&gt; gentle degree of temperament is all that&apos;s needed.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; So, concretely: if we assume the ancient preference for<br/>&gt; &gt; superparticulars, we might come up with a very lovely sounding<br/>&gt; &gt; tetrachord of, in step sizes, 11/10, 9/8, 14/13 (in any<br/>&gt; &gt; order). This in my opinion belongs in a rational system, not a<br/>&gt; &gt; tempered system, as we&apos;re looking at a comma of 2080:2079<br/>&gt; &gt; generated at the 4:3.  In a tempered system, temper it out.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; In fact you&apos;ve just brought up the topic of one of my favorite<br/>&gt; tetrachords, so nicely illustrated on your baglama, and which<br/>&gt; I&apos;ve been discussing in some of my Ethno Extras articles. This is<br/>&gt; Safi al-Din al-Urmawi&apos;s &quot;Medium Sundered&quot; which slightly enlarges<br/>&gt; the 14/13 to make a full 4/3: 9/8-11/10-320/297 or 204-165-129<br/>&gt; cents.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; A JI solution might be to &quot;temper by ratios&quot; by keeping  all<br/>&gt; steps superparticular, 9/8-11/10-14/13, and letting that fourth<br/>&gt; be narrow by a 2080:2079, less than a cent. But I guess that the<br/>&gt; idea of a tetrachord at a just 4:3 led Safi al-Din to stretch the<br/>&gt; 14:13 by that amount instead.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; On your baglama at 202-168-128 cents, a slightly enlarged 11/10<br/>&gt; takes up the slack for the minutely narrow 9/8 as well as the<br/>&gt; virtually just 14/13 -- two cents for the first, and another cent<br/>&gt; for the second, placing it at 168 rather than 165 cents. If the<br/>&gt; 9/8 were precisely just, we might similarly stretch 11/10 by<br/>&gt; exactly 2080:2079, getting 208/189 and a tuning of 204-166-128<br/>&gt; cents.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Now let&apos;s see what happens in O3 for a similar tetrachord. Giving<br/>&gt; Safi al-Din his due, we&apos;ll start with the tempered tetrachord<br/>&gt; closest to his 9/8-11/10-320/297. Then we&apos;ll see what happens in<br/>&gt; the almost identical tetrachord closest in its third size to your<br/>&gt; baglama.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;            Safi al-Din:   1/1     9/8    99/80   4/3<br/>&gt;                           0.0    203.9   368.9  498.0<br/>&gt;                               9:8    11:10  320:297<br/>&gt;                              203.9   165.0   129.1<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;            O3:             B       C#     Eb      E<br/>&gt;                           0.0    207.4   369.1  495.7<br/>&gt;                              207.4   161.7   126.6<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; While the tempered neutral third at 369.1 cents is almost<br/>&gt; identical to Safi al-Din&apos;s 99/80, the tone B-C# more than<br/>&gt; compensates for the 2080:2079 comma in the JI version by its<br/>&gt; wideness of about 3.5 cents in comparison to 9/8. The fourth,<br/>&gt; tempered at about 2.3 cents narrow, is impure by an amount almost<br/>&gt; three times that of the comma. And in the process, 11/10 gets<br/>&gt; compressed to 161.7 cents, or by about 3.3 cents, just a tad more<br/>&gt; than the 3.24 cents set as a maximum for the impurity of the<br/>&gt; ratios supported in his 29-HTT (secor29htt.scl in the Scala<br/>&gt; archive).<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; If we focus specifically on the interval from the neutral third<br/>&gt; to the fourth, Eb-E in the tempered version, we find that the<br/>&gt; third at 369.1 cents is a virtually just 99/80, but that the<br/>&gt; narrowing of the fourth by some 2.3 cents more than accounts for<br/>&gt; the 2080:2079 comma, indeed so much so that the remaining 14/13<br/>&gt; step, for from needing a bit of widening as in Safi al-Din, is<br/>&gt; actually narrow by about 1.7 cents (126.6 vs. 128.3 cents).<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Now let&apos;s look at a trivially different tempered tetrachord<br/>&gt; closer to your baglama&apos;s slightly larger neutral third, which<br/>&gt; I&apos;ll call a virtually just 26/21, likewise taking your fourth as<br/>&gt; a just 4/3:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;      Cameron&apos;s baglama:    0        202     370   498<br/>&gt;                                202      168    128<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;      O3:                   F#       G#      Bb     B<br/>&gt;                            0       208.6   370.3 496.9<br/>&gt;                               208.6    161.7  126.6<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Here the two upper melodic steps of the tempered tetrachord are<br/>&gt; identical to those of the last, but the major second at 208.6<br/>&gt; cents, and the fourth at 496.9 cents, are 1/1024 octave larger.<br/>&gt; Your baglama and O3 may be about equally far in their central<br/>&gt; steps from a just 11/10 at 165 cents, albeit in opposite<br/>&gt; directions, Here, with the tempered third at a virtually just<br/>&gt; 26/21, the remaining step would be a just 14/13 -- except that<br/>&gt; the fourth is narrow, this time by about 1.2 cents.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; What about the 1287/1280 comma at 4:3 were we to use the also<br/>&gt; &gt; lovely combination of 13/12, 11/10 and 9/8 to make our<br/>&gt; &gt; tetrachord? That&apos;s already almost 9.5 cents.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Humorously, with O3, I can give the answer that the steps aren&apos;t<br/>&gt; so arranged that it&apos;s possible to combine these ratios all in a<br/>&gt; single tetrachord, so the question doesn&apos;t arise &lt;grin&gt;. What O3<br/>&gt; does have with 9/8 and 13/12 that might go a step further is this<br/>&gt; tetrachord in the manner of one school of Aleppo for Maqam &grave;Iraq:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;           Eb    E     F#     G*<br/>&gt;           0   126.6  334.0  472.3<br/>&gt;            126.6  207.4  138.3<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; My point here, leaving aside the fine points of this tetrachord<br/>&gt; (apart from noting that the Syrian 6-9-6 commas would be around<br/>&gt; 135-340-475 cents, with my 126.6-cent step rather smaller),<br/>&gt; is that altered fourths and fifths sometimes go with the<br/>&gt; territory. But let&apos;s get back to 13/12, 11/10, and 9/8, and see<br/>&gt; how Ozan&apos;s 79-MOS might handle this. Suppose we want to keep all<br/>&gt; three superparticular steps as close as possible to just. If we<br/>&gt; start on step 13 of his scale (Scala archives, 79-159.scl), his<br/>&gt; tempered or meantone major second step in Maqam Rast known as<br/>&gt; perde dugah, we can do the following:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; JI:            1/1     13/12  143/120  429/320<br/>&gt;                  0      138.6   303.6    507.4<br/>&gt;                    13/12    11/10     9/8<br/>&gt;                    138.6    165.0    203.9<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;   yarmans:       0       9        20      33L<br/>&gt;   79-MOS:        0     135.8    301.9    505.7<br/>&gt;                   135.8     166.0    203.8<br/>&gt;                     9        11       13L<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; You&apos;ll see that Ozan&apos;s meantone fourth at 505.7 cents, or 1/3<br/>&gt; Holderian comma wide, absorbs most of the burden of that<br/>&gt; 1287/1280 comma, with the narrowing of 13/12 by not quite 3 cents<br/>&gt; taking up the rest of the comma, and also compensating for the<br/>&gt; tempering of 11/10 at about a cent wide. The numbers of yarmans,<br/>&gt; or 79-MOS steps normally at 2/3 Holderian comma (2/159 octave) or<br/>&gt; just over 15 cents, may help clarify the process. In the 79-MOS,<br/>&gt; there is one &quot;large&quot; step at a full comma or about 1/53 octave,<br/>&gt; and the notations &quot;33L&quot; for the fourth and &quot;13L&quot; for the 9/8 step<br/>&gt; that concludes the tetrachord show an interval including this<br/>&gt; large or full-comma tuning step.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Another solution would be to trim the 9/8 by 1/3 comma, and let<br/>&gt; the fourth remain precisely or virtually pure. For example,<br/>&gt; starting on Ozan&apos;s 1/1 or perde rast:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; JI:            1/1     13/12  143/120  429/320<br/>&gt;                  0      138.6   303.6    507.4<br/>&gt;                    13/12    11/10     9/8<br/>&gt;                    138.6    165.0    203.9<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;   yarmans:       0        9       20      33<br/>&gt;   79-MOS:        0      135.8   301.9    498.1<br/>&gt;                   135.8     166.0    196.2<br/>&gt;                     9        11        13<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; This time the upper major second gets narrowed by the lion&apos;s<br/>&gt; share of the comma instead of the fourth being widened by a<br/>&gt; comparable amount, and all the intervals are built from regular<br/>&gt; tuning steps of 2/3 Holderian comma or around 15 cents.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; At 12/11, 11/10, 9/8 we&apos;ve got a concrete comma. At almost a<br/>&gt; &gt; syntonic comma wide, I suspect that it may be one of the very<br/>&gt; &gt; commas that grates against 24-tET approximation.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Here my first reaction is that 12/11 plus 11/10 should be<br/>&gt; precisely a 6/5, and that plus 9/8 precisely a 27/20, so that we<br/>&gt; are indeed a syntonic comma wide. Change the 9/8 to a 10/9, and<br/>&gt; we have a 4/3, as well as Ptolemy&apos;s Equable Diatonic that Cris<br/>&gt; was recently discussing, at 12:11:10:9.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; But this might invite the consideration of one more case where<br/>&gt; the comma involved using only superparticular ratios must somehow<br/>&gt; be accounted for, and a temperament stays fairly close to one JI<br/>&gt; solution. Let&apos;s consider a tetrachord which could be used in<br/>&gt; Persian Shur, Arab Bayyati, or Turkish Arazbar, for example:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; JI:       1/1    13/12   13/11     4/3<br/>&gt;             0     138.6   289.2    498.0<br/>&gt;              13:12    12:11    44:39<br/>&gt;              138.6    150.6    208.8<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; O3:        F#      G*      A        B<br/>&gt;             0     138.3   289.5    496.9<br/>&gt;              138.3    151.2    207.4<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; In the just version, we have a 13:12:11 division of a 13/11 minor<br/>&gt; third, so that reaching a pure 4/3 requires a major second wider<br/>&gt; than 9/8 by a 352:351 at some 4.9 cents, in other words a 44/39,<br/>&gt; thus, on monochord, 52:48:44:39.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; In O3, the 13/12 and 12/11 steps are virtually just, so the<br/>&gt; 352:351 gets handled essentially in two ways. First, the tone at<br/>&gt; 207.4 cents is about 3.5 cents wide of 9/8, and not too far from<br/>&gt; 44/39. Secondly, the fourth is narrow by not quite 1.2 cents. As<br/>&gt; it happens, the 13/11 is at this location a tad wide at 289.5<br/>&gt; cents compared to a just 289.2, helping with the comma also.  At<br/>&gt; some other locations, where 13/11 is not quite a cent narrow of<br/>&gt; just at 288.3 cents, a wider major second at 208.6 cents (almost<br/>&gt; precisely 44/39), or narrower fourth at 495.7 cents, is there to<br/>&gt; compensate.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; So we have commas of less than a cent, like the 2080:2079 as with<br/>&gt; the beautiful Rast tetrachord made famous by your baglama (Safi<br/>&gt; al-Din didn&apos;t call it Rast, but it wonderfully fits that maqam);<br/>&gt; commas of around 4-5 cents like the 352:351; and the &quot;biggies&quot;<br/>&gt; like your 1207:1280 example approaching 9.5 cents, and yet more<br/>&gt; so the 81:80 at 21.5 cents or the 64/63 at 27.3 cents.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; With the larger commas, I take a &quot;JI-ish&quot; perspective: let them<br/>&gt; stand. For me, the 64:63 is the main one I deal with regularly.<br/>&gt; In O3, some small ones like the 352:351 are tempered out, while<br/>&gt; the 2080:2079 might in a sense be &quot;observed&quot; (e.g. 369.1 cents as<br/>&gt; Safi al-Din&apos;s 99/80, and 370.3 cents as your baglama&apos;s 26/21),<br/>&gt; hopefully while keeping a &quot;quasi-rational&quot; structure for the most<br/>&gt; part intact.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; And large commas can be invaluable, not only for yielding<br/>&gt; &quot;special effects&quot; intervals like 21/16 when we want them, but for<br/>&gt; permitting more choices: a smaller or larger neutral second to<br/>&gt; start this tetrachord, or a 7/4 or a 16/9? Jacques and I both<br/>&gt; seem to devise 17-note sets or subsets, for Persian music for<br/>&gt; example, and then throw in a couple of extra notes to add comma<br/>&gt; alternatives.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Please forgive me if this is too long: a lot of this stuff about<br/>&gt; maqam tetrachords and tempering may not have been presented so<br/>&gt; systematically before, and, of course, what I&apos;ve written about<br/>&gt; Ozan&apos;s 79/80-MOS is very much subject to his correction or<br/>&gt; amendment!<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Most appreciatively,<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Margo<br/>&gt; mschulter@...<br/>&gt;</p></div><h3><a id=94387 href="#94387">ðŸ”—</a>Brofessor &#x3C;kraiggrady@...&#x3E;</h3><span>11/9/2010 3:12:47 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>While notation can be based on the harmonic identity, it is also possible to define it by its melodic position in a scale.<br/> This is mainly the method used in generalized keyboard mappings where what is a sharp in one system need not be the same in the other.

Regardless of what kind of music, I feel that notation should only define pitch to the point at which you&apos;d prefer to have the performer make their own choice.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Obviously for music which has as part of its very essence extreme precision in pitch is going to need extreme precision in notation- or something that effects extreme precision.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; But, it is precisely such music which rarely presents a problem in notation, for such music is often electronically synthesized, in which case specification of pitch to microscopic precision is downright trivial, and the &quot;score&quot; is often computer code anyway, such that &quot;reading the score&quot; and producing the music are the same act. And, the score of acoustic music which has as a prequisite radical precision of pitch definition often assumes, in practice, the actual instruments upon which it is performed. This is similar to the tradition of the gamelan- and of the pianoforte in &quot;atonal&quot; music for that matter. An example of this would be acoustic pieces and repertoires with very specific pitch requirements such as proportionate beating.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; In general though, I feel that notation should leave room for intonational interpretation. If specific intonation or purpose-built tuning is desired, then pitch references- electronic, monochord, marimba- should be included with the score. But the score itself should only have very specific pitch indications when necessary.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Where the line of &quot;specific&quot; pitch is drawn is surely a matter of an agreement, not, in real life, necessarily amicable or bilateral, between composer and performers.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Of course, temperament, or the deliberate acceptance of small commas, is necessary if the approach is to create new chord progressions by tempering out, or tempering out in effect, unusual commas. It is not necessary for circulation- unless your standard of circulation requires literal or near-literal transpositions of specific pitch combinations.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; --- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, Margo Schulter &lt;mschulter@&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; [Dear Cameron: In what follows I address some temeperament<br/>&gt; &gt; questions and some of the tetrachords you discuss, as well as a<br/>&gt; &gt; couple of others that might illustrate some related comma<br/>&gt; &gt; questions.

And the kind of tuning or temperament system will reflect<br/>&gt; &gt; both the medieval Islamic and more recent tetrachords in use, and<br/>&gt; &gt; the logic of a given polyphonic style. That can mean creative<br/>&gt; &gt; compromises in various directions -- and often dramatically<br/>&gt; &gt; different ones for different people and styles.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; Thus for Ozan, &quot;polyphony&quot; often means a desire for thirds at or<br/>&gt; &gt; close to 5/4 -- or ideally a tad lower, by the schisma of Safi<br/>&gt; &gt; al-Din al-Urmawi and the 24-note Pythgorean model of AEU, or<br/>&gt; &gt; maybe around 382 cents, as suggested in one of his posts. Since<br/>&gt; &gt; Ozan also wants an optional meantone path to that Rast third near<br/>&gt; &gt; 5/4, he uses a 79/80-MOS very close to 159-EDO, with some fifths<br/>&gt; &gt; tempered by 1/3 Holderian comma or 1/159 octave while others<br/>&gt; &gt; remain literally pure (by minute modifications to 159-EDO) or<br/>&gt; &gt; virtually pure. There are both schismatic and meantone paths to<br/>&gt; &gt; that 5/4 region, and the temperament of some fifths by over 7<br/>&gt; &gt; cents (a bit more than in 19-EDO) is the necessary and logical<br/>&gt; &gt; compromise to achieve that goal.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; For me, &quot;polyphony&quot; means adopting 13th-14th century European<br/>&gt; &gt; techniques to a maqam context rich with its Zalzalian steps and<br/>&gt; &gt; intervals. In 13th-14th century music of Continental Europe,<br/>&gt; &gt; based mostly on Pythagorean intonation, fifths and fourths are<br/>&gt; &gt; the stable consonances, with thirds and sixths more or less<br/>&gt; &gt; relatively concordant but complex and unstable, seeking<br/>&gt; &gt; resolution to unisons, fifths, or octaves, for example. So<br/>&gt; &gt; neutral thirds at various ratios fit in nicely. And something<br/>&gt; &gt; like 26/21 is especially dilectable, because 370 cents is like a<br/>&gt; &gt; &quot;Zalzalian ditone&quot; with the same kind of pleasant complexity as<br/>&gt; &gt; 14/11 at 418 cents, for example.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; These are two different worlds. In Ozan&apos;s, 5/4 and 6/5 are needed<br/>&gt; &gt; both as fitting one side of current Turkish maqam practice which<br/>&gt; &gt; might be traced back at least to the 17-note Pythagorean<br/>&gt; &gt; &quot;Systematist&quot; theory of the 13th century (and I believe Cris<br/>&gt; &gt; shows to further back than that), and to meet the needs of his<br/>&gt; &gt; polyphonic style using 5-limit consonances.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; In mine, the emphasis is on ratios of 2-3-7-11-13, and any<br/>&gt; &gt; occurrences of 5/4 or 6/5 approximations are more or less<br/>&gt; &gt; incidental, rather than a basic or intended feature of a<br/>&gt; &gt; neomedieval system. The rules of counterpoint can apply to<br/>&gt; &gt; general categories of intervals: for example, &quot;a major, minor, or<br/>&gt; &gt; Zalzalian third often tends to contract to a unison or expand to<br/>&gt; &gt; a fifth.&quot;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; My principal tuning is based on ratios of 2-3-7-13, with a handful of inevitable incidental near-11 ratios occuring. By near-11, an example would be that of a 16/13 above 4/3 differind from a 12/11 above 3/2 by a touch less than 5 cents. If there is indeed a pull exerted by successive superparticular intervals, it would be reasonable to assume that I&apos;d sharp the Ad when going F-G-Ad, and reasonable, given my thoughts on tempering for notation, to temper out the 352/351 between 128/117 and 12711 (128/117 being the ratio of illusory &quot;complexity&quot; which arises between G and Ad when Ad is a 16/13 above F, F and G being Pythagorean here of course).<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; Furthermore, Ozan for his purposes needs an option for a<br/>&gt; &gt; circulating 12-note chromatic scale to permit compatibility with<br/>&gt; &gt; Western music based on a 12-note well-temperament or 12-EDO, one<br/>&gt; &gt; of the design principles of his 79/80-MOS. What I need is<br/>&gt; &gt; compatibility with 13th-14th century European style based on<br/>&gt; &gt; Pythagoran intonation, of which I see a single 12-note keyboard<br/>&gt; &gt; in O3 as a gentle modification, with an Eb-G# chain of fifths<br/>&gt; &gt; tempered in 1024-EDO at an average of around 703.871 cents.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I believe that we discussed this long ago- the slightly sharp fifths are to my ears &quot;more real than real&quot;, given the concept of a fifth as bright or &quot;soldierly&quot;. Of course they are wrong when the concept of a fifth is a soft meantone-style interval. With instruments of flexible pitch, I would speculate that the fifth is also often modified minutely depending on context- mellow here, pure there, brilliant elsewhere.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Well I&apos;ll have to comment further at a later date!<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; -Cameron Bobro<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; And temperament is an essential ingredient for both of us. Thus<br/>&gt; &gt; on Ozan&apos;s 79/80-tone qanun, we have a suggested Rast (following<br/>&gt; &gt; his thesis, p. 118(, of 0-196-392-498 cents, with the major third<br/>&gt; &gt; being formed from two meantone steps of 196 cents. As he notes,<br/>&gt; &gt; it is possible to spell this tetrachord simply C-D-E-F.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; While temperament gets Ozan his meantone path to a near-5/4, it<br/>&gt; &gt; gets me my &quot;neo-Systematist&quot; path to neutral or Zalzalian<br/>&gt; &gt; intervals found within a single 12-note keyboard, for example in<br/>&gt; &gt; a Rast tetrachord like B-C#-Eb-E at 0-207-369-496 cents or<br/>&gt; &gt; 207-162-127 cents. Note that on a Pythagorean keyboard, this same<br/>&gt; &gt; spelling would result in a schismatic tetrachord of 0-204-384-498<br/>&gt; &gt; cents, or 204-180-114 cents. These &quot;schismatic&quot; mappings thus<br/>&gt; &gt; generate on each of the two 12-note keyboards the smallest and<br/>&gt; &gt; largest neutral intervals, for example steps near 14:13 and<br/>&gt; &gt; 11:10, while combining notes from the two keyboards (spaced at<br/>&gt; &gt; 57.422 cents) produces central neutral intervals like steps near<br/>&gt; &gt; 13:12 and 12:11.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; Here I don&apos;t want to get too enmeshed in the mechanics of the<br/>&gt; &gt; 79/80-MOS, on which Ozan is of course the expert, and O3, but to<br/>&gt; &gt; give some idea of how polyphonic styles can vary and influence<br/>&gt; &gt; tuning systems to move in different directions while still<br/>&gt; &gt; sharing common themes like a desire for accurate representations<br/>&gt; &gt; of superparticular middle seconds.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; It&apos;s clear from simply listening to various maqam musics that<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; the Pythagorean skeletal structures and the simplest of<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; intervals are not sacrosanct- the melodic step is very<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; powerful. Farhat is very big on this. For the creating of a<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; practical system of non-infinite scope- like tuning a qanun-<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; this surely creates a serious problem. If it&apos;s true that<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; microtonal inflections along the lines of, say, a &quot;fourth&quot; at<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; 515 cents (remembered from tuning up to jam along with a video<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; on YouTube) are essential characteristics, the magnitude of the<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; problem of where to temper is clearly immense.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; If circulation isn&apos;t a consideration, which it certainly isn&apos;t in<br/>&gt; &gt; traditional Iranian music or Farhat&apos;s 17-note tar tuning, then<br/>&gt; &gt; &quot;odd&quot; fourths and fifths can be a strength. For example, in the<br/>&gt; &gt; 24-note O3 temperament, we have a location where the closest<br/>&gt; &gt; available fourth is 485 cents -- almost identical, as I learned<br/>&gt; &gt; in a book by Nelly Caron and Dariouche Safvate, to a 484-cent<br/>&gt; &gt; fourth used in a traditional tuning of a beautiful dastgah or<br/>&gt; &gt; avaz (a satellite dastgah to the principal seven) known as the<br/>&gt; &gt; Old Bayat-e Tork. They give 0-204-346-484-704-908-980-1200<br/>&gt; &gt; cents.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; More generally, the Iranian taste for septimal or near-septimal<br/>&gt; &gt; intervals means that we&apos;re not going to get a tidy 17-note<br/>&gt; &gt; circulating system on tar. Caron and Safvate, on the basis of<br/>&gt; &gt; measuring one or more instruments, give a Shur tetrachord at<br/>&gt; &gt; 0-136-276-500 cents or 136-140-224 cents. A large tone that close<br/>&gt; &gt; to 8:7 means that we can expect at least one notably narrow<br/>&gt; &gt; fourth of the kind found in the &quot;Old Tork&quot; above.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; In O3, we have 24 positions and 22 of them with usual fifths at<br/>&gt; &gt; 703.1 or 704.3 cents -- the &quot;odd&quot; two at G#-Eb* (an asterisk<br/>&gt; &gt; showing a note on the upper keyboard) with a 714.8-cent fifth,<br/>&gt; &gt; and G#*-E at 726.6 cents, or close to 32/21. And there are a<br/>&gt; &gt; number of locations with a choice between 4/3 or 21/16, something<br/>&gt; &gt; George Secor has taught me to relish, and nice for doing<br/>&gt; &gt; different interpretations of Maqam &grave;Iraq (some Syrians favor a<br/>&gt; &gt; fourth at 21 commas or around 475 cents, realized at 472 or 473<br/>&gt; &gt; cents in this temperament).<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; For Ozan, it _is_ vital to circulate, and he&apos;s made some<br/>&gt; &gt; intricate and delicate compromises to do so while supporting lots<br/>&gt; &gt; of neutral or Zalzalian flavors, among many other things.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; I don&apos;t face this problem personally, as I simply use pure, or<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; plainly altered.  This (using either pure or plainly altered)<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; is, in my opinion, the only real option in a limited system<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; that is not attempting to shoulder a huge burden.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; Yes, and the &quot;limited system&quot; concept certainly applies to O3<br/>&gt; &gt; with only 24 notes. Not being concerned with either circulation<br/>&gt; &gt; or the syntonic comma simplifies lots of things, and means a<br/>&gt; &gt; gentle degree of temperament is all that&apos;s needed.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; So, concretely: if we assume the ancient preference for<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; superparticulars, we might come up with a very lovely sounding<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; tetrachord of, in step sizes, 11/10, 9/8, 14/13 (in any<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; order). This in my opinion belongs in a rational system, not a<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; tempered system, as we&apos;re looking at a comma of 2080:2079<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; generated at the 4:3.  In a tempered system, temper it out.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; In fact you&apos;ve just brought up the topic of one of my favorite<br/>&gt; &gt; tetrachords, so nicely illustrated on your baglama, and which<br/>&gt; &gt; I&apos;ve been discussing in some of my Ethno Extras articles. This is<br/>&gt; &gt; Safi al-Din al-Urmawi&apos;s &quot;Medium Sundered&quot; which slightly enlarges<br/>&gt; &gt; the 14/13 to make a full 4/3: 9/8-11/10-320/297 or 204-165-129<br/>&gt; &gt; cents.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; A JI solution might be to &quot;temper by ratios&quot; by keeping  all<br/>&gt; &gt; steps superparticular, 9/8-11/10-14/13, and letting that fourth<br/>&gt; &gt; be narrow by a 2080:2079, less than a cent. But I guess that the<br/>&gt; &gt; idea of a tetrachord at a just 4:3 led Safi al-Din to stretch the<br/>&gt; &gt; 14:13 by that amount instead.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; On your baglama at 202-168-128 cents, a slightly enlarged 11/10<br/>&gt; &gt; takes up the slack for the minutely narrow 9/8 as well as the<br/>&gt; &gt; virtually just 14/13 -- two cents for the first, and another cent<br/>&gt; &gt; for the second, placing it at 168 rather than 165 cents. If the<br/>&gt; &gt; 9/8 were precisely just, we might similarly stretch 11/10 by<br/>&gt; &gt; exactly 2080:2079, getting 208/189 and a tuning of 204-166-128<br/>&gt; &gt; cents.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; Now let&apos;s see what happens in O3 for a similar tetrachord. Giving<br/>&gt; &gt; Safi al-Din his due, we&apos;ll start with the tempered tetrachord<br/>&gt; &gt; closest to his 9/8-11/10-320/297. Then we&apos;ll see what happens in<br/>&gt; &gt; the almost identical tetrachord closest in its third size to your<br/>&gt; &gt; baglama.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;            Safi al-Din:   1/1     9/8    99/80   4/3<br/>&gt; &gt;                           0.0    203.9   368.9  498.0<br/>&gt; &gt;                               9:8    11:10  320:297<br/>&gt; &gt;                              203.9   165.0   129.1<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;            O3:             B       C#     Eb      E<br/>&gt; &gt;                           0.0    207.4   369.1  495.7<br/>&gt; &gt;                              207.4   161.7   126.6<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; While the tempered neutral third at 369.1 cents is almost<br/>&gt; &gt; identical to Safi al-Din&apos;s 99/80, the tone B-C# more than<br/>&gt; &gt; compensates for the 2080:2079 comma in the JI version by its<br/>&gt; &gt; wideness of about 3.5 cents in comparison to 9/8. The fourth,<br/>&gt; &gt; tempered at about 2.3 cents narrow, is impure by an amount almost<br/>&gt; &gt; three times that of the comma. And in the process, 11/10 gets<br/>&gt; &gt; compressed to 161.7 cents, or by about 3.3 cents, just a tad more<br/>&gt; &gt; than the 3.24 cents set as a maximum for the impurity of the<br/>&gt; &gt; ratios supported in his 29-HTT (secor29htt.scl in the Scala<br/>&gt; &gt; archive).<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; If we focus specifically on the interval from the neutral third<br/>&gt; &gt; to the fourth, Eb-E in the tempered version, we find that the<br/>&gt; &gt; third at 369.1 cents is a virtually just 99/80, but that the<br/>&gt; &gt; narrowing of the fourth by some 2.3 cents more than accounts for<br/>&gt; &gt; the 2080:2079 comma, indeed so much so that the remaining 14/13<br/>&gt; &gt; step, for from needing a bit of widening as in Safi al-Din, is<br/>&gt; &gt; actually narrow by about 1.7 cents (126.6 vs. 128.3 cents).<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; Now let&apos;s look at a trivially different tempered tetrachord<br/>&gt; &gt; closer to your baglama&apos;s slightly larger neutral third, which<br/>&gt; &gt; I&apos;ll call a virtually just 26/21, likewise taking your fourth as<br/>&gt; &gt; a just 4/3:<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;      Cameron&apos;s baglama:    0        202     370   498<br/>&gt; &gt;                                202      168    128<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;      O3:                   F#       G#      Bb     B<br/>&gt; &gt;                            0       208.6   370.3 496.9<br/>&gt; &gt;                               208.6    161.7  126.6<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; Here the two upper melodic steps of the tempered tetrachord are<br/>&gt; &gt; identical to those of the last, but the major second at 208.6<br/>&gt; &gt; cents, and the fourth at 496.9 cents, are 1/1024 octave larger.<br/>&gt; &gt; Your baglama and O3 may be about equally far in their central<br/>&gt; &gt; steps from a just 11/10 at 165 cents, albeit in opposite<br/>&gt; &gt; directions, Here, with the tempered third at a virtually just<br/>&gt; &gt; 26/21, the remaining step would be a just 14/13 -- except that<br/>&gt; &gt; the fourth is narrow, this time by about 1.2 cents.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; What about the 1287/1280 comma at 4:3 were we to use the also<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; lovely combination of 13/12, 11/10 and 9/8 to make our<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; tetrachord? That&apos;s already almost 9.5 cents.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; Humorously, with O3, I can give the answer that the steps aren&apos;t<br/>&gt; &gt; so arranged that it&apos;s possible to combine these ratios all in a<br/>&gt; &gt; single tetrachord, so the question doesn&apos;t arise &lt;grin&gt;. What O3<br/>&gt; &gt; does have with 9/8 and 13/12 that might go a step further is this<br/>&gt; &gt; tetrachord in the manner of one school of Aleppo for Maqam &grave;Iraq:<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;           Eb    E     F#     G*<br/>&gt; &gt;           0   126.6  334.0  472.3<br/>&gt; &gt;            126.6  207.4  138.3<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; My point here, leaving aside the fine points of this tetrachord<br/>&gt; &gt; (apart from noting that the Syrian 6-9-6 commas would be around<br/>&gt; &gt; 135-340-475 cents, with my 126.6-cent step rather smaller),<br/>&gt; &gt; is that altered fourths and fifths sometimes go with the<br/>&gt; &gt; territory. But let&apos;s get back to 13/12, 11/10, and 9/8, and see<br/>&gt; &gt; how Ozan&apos;s 79-MOS might handle this. Suppose we want to keep all<br/>&gt; &gt; three superparticular steps as close as possible to just. If we<br/>&gt; &gt; start on step 13 of his scale (Scala archives, 79-159.scl), his<br/>&gt; &gt; tempered or meantone major second step in Maqam Rast known as<br/>&gt; &gt; perde dugah, we can do the following:<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; JI:            1/1     13/12  143/120  429/320<br/>&gt; &gt;                  0      138.6   303.6    507.4<br/>&gt; &gt;                    13/12    11/10     9/8<br/>&gt; &gt;                    138.6    165.0    203.9<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;   yarmans:       0       9        20      33L<br/>&gt; &gt;   79-MOS:        0     135.8    301.9    505.7<br/>&gt; &gt;                   135.8     166.0    203.8<br/>&gt; &gt;                     9        11       13L<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; You&apos;ll see that Ozan&apos;s meantone fourth at 505.7 cents, or 1/3<br/>&gt; &gt; Holderian comma wide, absorbs most of the burden of that<br/>&gt; &gt; 1287/1280 comma, with the narrowing of 13/12 by not quite 3 cents<br/>&gt; &gt; taking up the rest of the comma, and also compensating for the<br/>&gt; &gt; tempering of 11/10 at about a cent wide. The numbers of yarmans,<br/>&gt; &gt; or 79-MOS steps normally at 2/3 Holderian comma (2/159 octave) or<br/>&gt; &gt; just over 15 cents, may help clarify the process. In the 79-MOS,<br/>&gt; &gt; there is one &quot;large&quot; step at a full comma or about 1/53 octave,<br/>&gt; &gt; and the notations &quot;33L&quot; for the fourth and &quot;13L&quot; for the 9/8 step<br/>&gt; &gt; that concludes the tetrachord show an interval including this<br/>&gt; &gt; large or full-comma tuning step.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; Another solution would be to trim the 9/8 by 1/3 comma, and let<br/>&gt; &gt; the fourth remain precisely or virtually pure. For example,<br/>&gt; &gt; starting on Ozan&apos;s 1/1 or perde rast:<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; JI:            1/1     13/12  143/120  429/320<br/>&gt; &gt;                  0      138.6   303.6    507.4<br/>&gt; &gt;                    13/12    11/10     9/8<br/>&gt; &gt;                    138.6    165.0    203.9<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;   yarmans:       0        9       20      33<br/>&gt; &gt;   79-MOS:        0      135.8   301.9    498.1<br/>&gt; &gt;                   135.8     166.0    196.2<br/>&gt; &gt;                     9        11        13<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; This time the upper major second gets narrowed by the lion&apos;s<br/>&gt; &gt; share of the comma instead of the fourth being widened by a<br/>&gt; &gt; comparable amount, and all the intervals are built from regular<br/>&gt; &gt; tuning steps of 2/3 Holderian comma or around 15 cents.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; At 12/11, 11/10, 9/8 we&apos;ve got a concrete comma. At almost a<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; syntonic comma wide, I suspect that it may be one of the very<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; commas that grates against 24-tET approximation.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; Here my first reaction is that 12/11 plus 11/10 should be<br/>&gt; &gt; precisely a 6/5, and that plus 9/8 precisely a 27/20, so that we<br/>&gt; &gt; are indeed a syntonic comma wide. Change the 9/8 to a 10/9, and<br/>&gt; &gt; we have a 4/3, as well as Ptolemy&apos;s Equable Diatonic that Cris<br/>&gt; &gt; was recently discussing, at 12:11:10:9.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; But this might invite the consideration of one more case where<br/>&gt; &gt; the comma involved using only superparticular ratios must somehow<br/>&gt; &gt; be accounted for, and a temperament stays fairly close to one JI<br/>&gt; &gt; solution. Let&apos;s consider a tetrachord which could be used in<br/>&gt; &gt; Persian Shur, Arab Bayyati, or Turkish Arazbar, for example:<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; JI:       1/1    13/12   13/11     4/3<br/>&gt; &gt;             0     138.6   289.2    498.0<br/>&gt; &gt;              13:12    12:11    44:39<br/>&gt; &gt;              138.6    150.6    208.8<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; O3:        F#      G*      A        B<br/>&gt; &gt;             0     138.3   289.5    496.9<br/>&gt; &gt;              138.3    151.2    207.4<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; In the just version, we have a 13:12:11 division of a 13/11 minor<br/>&gt; &gt; third, so that reaching a pure 4/3 requires a major second wider<br/>&gt; &gt; than 9/8 by a 352:351 at some 4.9 cents, in other words a 44/39,<br/>&gt; &gt; thus, on monochord, 52:48:44:39.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; In O3, the 13/12 and 12/11 steps are virtually just, so the<br/>&gt; &gt; 352:351 gets handled essentially in two ways. First, the tone at<br/>&gt; &gt; 207.4 cents is about 3.5 cents wide of 9/8, and not too far from<br/>&gt; &gt; 44/39. Secondly, the fourth is narrow by not quite 1.2 cents. As<br/>&gt; &gt; it happens, the 13/11 is at this location a tad wide at 289.5<br/>&gt; &gt; cents compared to a just 289.2, helping with the comma also.  At<br/>&gt; &gt; some other locations, where 13/11 is not quite a cent narrow of<br/>&gt; &gt; just at 288.3 cents, a wider major second at 208.6 cents (almost<br/>&gt; &gt; precisely 44/39), or narrower fourth at 495.7 cents, is there to<br/>&gt; &gt; compensate.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; So we have commas of less than a cent, like the 2080:2079 as with<br/>&gt; &gt; the beautiful Rast tetrachord made famous by your baglama (Safi<br/>&gt; &gt; al-Din didn&apos;t call it Rast, but it wonderfully fits that maqam);<br/>&gt; &gt; commas of around 4-5 cents like the 352:351; and the &quot;biggies&quot;<br/>&gt; &gt; like your 1207:1280 example approaching 9.5 cents, and yet more<br/>&gt; &gt; so the 81:80 at 21.5 cents or the 64/63 at 27.3 cents.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; With the larger commas, I take a &quot;JI-ish&quot; perspective: let them<br/>&gt; &gt; stand. For me, the 64:63 is the main one I deal with regularly.<br/>&gt; &gt; In O3, some small ones like the 352:351 are tempered out, while<br/>&gt; &gt; the 2080:2079 might in a sense be &quot;observed&quot; (e.g. 369.1 cents as<br/>&gt; &gt; Safi al-Din&apos;s 99/80, and 370.3 cents as your baglama&apos;s 26/21),<br/>&gt; &gt; hopefully while keeping a &quot;quasi-rational&quot; structure for the most<br/>&gt; &gt; part intact.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; And large commas can be invaluable, not only for yielding<br/>&gt; &gt; &quot;special effects&quot; intervals like 21/16 when we want them, but for<br/>&gt; &gt; permitting more choices: a smaller or larger neutral second to<br/>&gt; &gt; start this tetrachord, or a 7/4 or a 16/9? Jacques and I both<br/>&gt; &gt; seem to devise 17-note sets or subsets, for Persian music for<br/>&gt; &gt; example, and then throw in a couple of extra notes to add comma<br/>&gt; &gt; alternatives.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; Please forgive me if this is too long: a lot of this stuff about<br/>&gt; &gt; maqam tetrachords and tempering may not have been presented so<br/>&gt; &gt; systematically before, and, of course, what I&apos;ve written about<br/>&gt; &gt; Ozan&apos;s 79/80-MOS is very much subject to his correction or<br/>&gt; &gt; amendment!<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; Most appreciatively,<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; Margo<br/>&gt; &gt; mschulter@<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt;</p></div><h3><a id=94389 href="#94389">ðŸ”—</a>Carl Lumma &#x3C;carl@...&#x3E;</h3><span>11/9/2010 3:46:26 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Hi Margo,</p><p>&gt; Here my intention in quoting Beyhom&apos;s reported values in<br/>&gt; cents and giving some his context, as imperfectly as I may<br/>&gt; be comprehending and translating his French, was to make his<br/>&gt; data and observations more accessible.</p><p>I&apos;m afraid such numbers don&apos;t mean much to me without knowing<br/>in detail how they were obtained.</p><p>&gt; In one recent post, Ozan interestingly took the view that<br/>&gt; we should regard such ratios for of all as &quot;RI&quot; or rational<br/>&gt; intonation landmarks which might or might not serve as<br/>&gt; special points of &quot;attraction&quot; to performers. That seems<br/>&gt; to me intuitive, pragmatic, and wise.</p><p>It seems to me random and unsubstantiated.  If someone wants<br/>to claim that one infinitely dense kind of numbers are being<br/>selected out of the sea of an even more infinitely dense kind<br/>(the reals), by musicians using musical instruments, one ought<br/>to have truckloads of evidence at the ready.  But I&apos;m happy<br/>to agree to disagree at this point.</p><p>&gt; Certainly I see no advantage in the yelling, and it might just<br/>&gt; be an advantage for me _not_ to be a moderator, so that I can<br/>&gt; advocate for a respectful dialogue from the vantage point of<br/>&gt; an NGO rather than an official representative of a government,<br/>&gt; so to speak.</p><p>As I am about to announce, Mike Battaglia is now a moderator.<br/>I&apos;ve had him in mind for almost a year now.  My powers persist<br/>a little while more, then I will be demoted, because I think<br/>three is the right number of moderators to have.<br/>As I suggested, you might replace Gene or David and I would<br/>wholeheartedly welcome this.  However, I&apos;ll note the main part<br/>of the job involves some technical details of using Yahoo&apos;s<br/>website, reading incoming posts that sometimes contain html<br/>elements, etc, which you may prefer to avoid.  I&apos;ll also note<br/>that both Gene and David have been doing an excellent job.<br/>So I&apos;ve also been thinking of suggesting the very alternative<br/>you mention above -- that we make you our official list Mom,<br/>or moderator-in-chief, or something of the sort.</p><p>&gt;&gt; As I remarked, such triads, when played in the proper (rather<br/>&gt;&gt; high) register can sound special.  But I haven&apos;t heard them in<br/>&gt;&gt; maqam music.  Like I said, maybe I need to get out more, but<br/>&gt;&gt; if people are so sure they&apos;re there I would have expected<br/>&gt;&gt; links offered straight away.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; One very important point: by &quot;triad,&quot; do you mean three notes<br/>&gt; played simultaneously at 12:13:14 or 11:12:13, for example --<br/>&gt; something I&apos;d call an isoharmonic tone cluster, maybe?</p><p>Yes.  Or played successively on an instrument with some sustain,<br/>resonant strings, room with lots of reverb, etc.  Stroking a<br/>santoor could do it.</p><p>&gt; If so, I must admit that over the better part of nine years in<br/>&gt; exploring these _melodic_ divisions and some tempered<br/>&gt; variations, it had never occurred to me to assume that all<br/>&gt; three notes would be played at once.</p><p>I&apos;ve long and also recently said I think there may be a tendency<br/>for musicians to divide a melodic jump harmonically in this<br/>fashion, especially if a tonic note is either sounding at least<br/>within memory.  But again, I think I&apos;ve noticed this on a few<br/>occasions when listening to jazz scat singing and Baroque<br/>soloists, but not when listening to maqam music.</p><p>It seems to me the maqamat are tetrachordal, and beyond that<br/>perhaps arbitrary (originally) but classified over time and<br/>refined into archetypes in the culture.  If anything, the neutral<br/>seconds etc. seem chosen to increase tension by being discordant<br/>against the 1 4/3 3/2 2/1 skeleton.  Weighing diverse seems to<br/>show peaks around 7/6 and it is certainly a plausible attractor,<br/>so I can&apos;t ignore it, even though, again, I&apos;ve never noticed it<br/>when listening.</p><p>&gt; That said, I would emphasize my understanding that medieval<br/>&gt; divisions like 14:13:12, and likewise Ptolemy&apos;s earlier Equable<br/>&gt; Diatonic at 12:11:10:9, are above all melodic phenomena,<br/>&gt; although they may have very interesting polyphonic and<br/>&gt; contrapuntal ramifications in a modern context that I see as<br/>&gt; quite apart from the traditional Near Eastern styles that<br/>&gt; we&apos;re discussing.</p><p>I couldn&apos;t be more enthusiastic about modern extensions of<br/>the art, such as those you and Ozan are interested in!<br/>It is often too tempting to think of maqam music as an object<br/>behind glass -- perhaps lost forever because of cultural<br/>contamination.  In fact cultures have been mixing for a long<br/>time, both within the Near East itself and with the West.<br/>Technology has also been improving for a long time giving<br/>musicians access to different kinds of instruments (metal<br/>strings, for example).  Like so many facets of the human<br/>condition, it&apos;s a continuous process, not a destination...</p><p>&gt; Just to make it clear, because I realize that lots of people may<br/>&gt; be oriented to chordal genres of music and music theory to the<br/>&gt; degree that misunderstandings are very easy: I might expect to<br/>&gt; hear something like 12:13:14 or 14:13:12 often played as a<br/>&gt; melodic figure in a relevant medieval or later Near Eastern<br/>&gt; context, but not as a simultaneous triad.</p><p>There is something of a list convention whereby simultaneities<br/>are written with a colon (5:4, 10:11:12, etc) whereas individual<br/>pitches should be written with a slash (1/1 11/10 6/5).  For<br/>subharmonic chords, the slash is allowed if the fractions are<br/>connected by dashes or underscores.  Not everybody follows this<br/>convention (notably Gene) and I&apos;m not perfect in applying it,<br/>but for future reference, I do try.</p><p>&gt; For example, Karl Signell found that the tuning of a theoretical<br/>&gt; 12-comma step on Necdet Yasar&apos;s tanbur was in the range of<br/>&gt; 270-273 cents, which I would say is close to 7/6 (267 cents), but<br/>&gt; actually in the slightly higher range of the advertised 12-comma<br/>&gt; interval, which Cris Forster calls a &quot;triple limma,&quot; about 271<br/>&gt; cents in a Pythagorean context (15 fourths down, or thrice<br/>&gt; 256/243 at 90.225 cents), and 271.70 cents in 53-EDO.</p><p>For the record, I have no problem calling any of these a 7/6,<br/>though of course there could be another reason for going there.</p><p>&gt; This is in Signell&apos;s classic _Makam: Modal Practice in Turkish<br/>&gt; Art Music_, Appendix A.</p><p>Thanks.</p><p>&gt; And Beyhom measures a Turkish performance of another flavor of<br/>&gt; Hijaz at 130-265-90 cents. Here the central interval of 265 cents<br/>&gt; is just narrow of 7/6,</p><p>The attractive range of 7:6 (or 7/6) seems to extend farther<br/>above than below...</p><p>&gt; Who on the tuning list, at least among people who get into<br/>&gt; analyses or theories of some kind, _isn&apos;t_ involved in &quot;numbers<br/>&gt; games&quot; of one kind or another? Can we really do the regular<br/>&gt; mapping paradigm or harmonic entropy without numbers?</p><p>We need numbers but not numbers games, which to me is a phrase<br/>associated with pseudoscience.</p><p>&gt; When Ozan records his analysis of a performance in Maqam Ushshaq<br/>&gt; as using a measured tetrachord of around 123-137-228 cents, and<br/>&gt; he and I agree that &quot;12:13:14:16&quot; is an approximate although not<br/>&gt; precise evocation of this tuning, then we&apos;re playing at the game<br/>&gt; of seeking connections and seeking to understand, with this RI<br/>&gt; model as one possible viewpoint.</p><p>Sure, it&apos;s a hypothesis that can be tested, with the ever-<br/>essential Razor of Occam standing ready.</p><p>&gt; The fact that Jean During seems to recommend using<br/>&gt; the audible 13th harmonic in tuning a small Persian neutral sixth<br/>&gt; at 13/8 doesn&apos;t necessarily mean that traditional Persian or<br/>&gt; other Iranian musicians necessarily prefer 13/8 or tune it in<br/>&gt; this fashion, although its favored position in Ibn Sina&apos;s &grave;oud<br/>&gt; tuning would make me ask if there might be any connection. My<br/>&gt; guess is that a small Persian neutral sixth might typically have<br/>&gt; a range of something like 830-845 cents, which would include Ibn<br/>&gt; Sina&apos;s ratio of 13/8 (841 cents), and also 21/13 (830 cents)</p><p>If it is the range 830-845, I see no reason to attach 13/8<br/>or 21/13 to it.  Such things are signposts but, it seems to<br/>me, potentially misleading ones.</p><p>&gt; &gt; Musica reservata certainly is an exception.  I assume you&apos;ve<br/>&gt; &gt; heard the latest stuff being done by Jon Wild, etc?

Maybe that was on another site.</p><p>&gt; And you also reminded me of Joseph Spencer and his program which<br/>&gt; I heard around the beginning of the 1990&apos;s on KPFA (easier to get<br/>&gt; in Sacramento then than now, as far as I know). I&apos;m not sure if I<br/>&gt; ever visited The Musical Offering, but those programs were<br/>&gt; something else again!</p><p>I was very fortunate to be able to hang out in the early music<br/>scene in Berkeley, for the biannual festival, as well as year-<br/>round at such refuges as Music Sources (one of my neighbors<br/>and best friends was a student of the late Laurette Goldberg).<br/>I probably played more harpsichord than piano in those days,<br/>though my own playing was seldom anything historical (except<br/>for a few tunes I learned from the Fitzwilliam book).</p><p>&gt; My move to Sacramento was in 1984, and I was very fortunate to<br/>&gt; find an apartment building near California State University,<br/>&gt; Sacramento (CSUS) with a very reasonable library.

In keeping with the &quot;regular<br/>temperament paradigm&quot; and how it seems to be imlemented most often, I<br/>think 625:384 would be a very reasonable, and extremely simple, choice<br/>for an interval to use or temper in this range.

For neutral<br/>sixths, a topic of interest in this discussion, we have 829 or<br/>830 cents as a usual augmented fifth (e.g. C-G#); 841 or 843<br/>cents as a minor sixth plus distance between keyboards (E-C*);<br/>853 or 854 cents as a major sixth less this distance (F*-D);<br/>and 865 or 866 cents as a usual diminished seventh (F#-Eb).</p><p>These shadings might correspond with 21/13 (830 cents); 13/8<br/>(841 cents); 18/11 (853 cents); and 33/20 (867 cents).</p><p>There are also seven comma steps of a bit over 23 cents, in<br/>fact virtually identical to a Pythagorean comma, permitting<br/>some creative choices on the sizes of melodic steps and vertical<br/>intervals. At the same time, it&apos;s possible to &quot;pull out&quot; 17-note<br/>thirdtone subsets with step sizes of 57.4, 69.1 or 70.3, and 80.9<br/>cents, a kind of virtual TOS or &quot;threefold order of symmetry,&quot;<br/>possibly trivalent. A 17-note TOS of Erv&apos;s Rast/Bayyati Matrix<br/>fits the pattern, apart from some variations of 1/1024 octave.</p><p>Neither these subsets, nor the 24-note system as a whole,<br/>is circulating by any usual definition: we have one location<br/>(G#-Eb*) with the closest approximation to 3:2 at 714.8 cents,<br/>and another (G#*-E) where it&apos;s 726.6 cents.</p><p>In short, the three main goals of O3 are near-just epimoric<br/>ratios, lots of neutral shadings, and a &quot;regularized&quot; keyboard<br/>with two 12-note Halberstadt manuals each basically a 12-MOS.<br/>Not being concerned about circulation, or the syntonic comma,<br/>makes this much easier!</p><p>And Cameron: I agree 100% that flexible-pitch performers<br/>shouldn&apos;t be limited by any temperament, circulating or<br/>otherwise! That&apos;s a point that bears repeating early and<br/>often!</p><p>Best,</p><p>Margo</p></div><h3><a id=94459 href="#94459">ðŸ”—</a>Carl Lumma &#x3C;carl@...&#x3E;</h3><span>11/11/2010 9:01:31 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Cameron wrote:</p><p>&gt; &gt; Unless I misunderstood, Margo and I were talking about<br/>&gt; &gt; traditional maqam music at that point.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Margo and Ozan, as far as I&apos;ve seen all this time, several<br/>&gt; years now, have always clearly stated this aspect of their<br/>&gt; approach to maqam analysis.</p><p>As I said, I believe you took the original out of context.</p><p>&gt; Even if this were not the case, it is an example of a very<br/>&gt; reasonable, practical use of rationals in analizing maqam music.</p><p>I for one would like to see more analysis.</p><p>&gt; Those are extremely close to 17 and 48 equal divisions of the<br/>&gt; octave,</p><p>Yes, I gave the optimal tuning.

Since no half-just intervals are<br/>&gt;  themselves just, good temperaments will seldom contain many of<br/>&gt;  them.</p><p>Here we may be dealing with rather different musical ideals, and<br/>concepts of temperament -- which doesn&apos;t mean anyone is wrong!</p><p>And &quot;justness&quot; may be less important than variety when we&apos;re<br/>talking about neutral second steps: 64-59-54 (140-154 cents)<br/>could be just as pleasing as 13-12-11 (139-151 cents), or for<br/>that matter 81-88-96 (88:81-12:11 or 143-151 cents). And this<br/>isn&apos;t to limit us to rational steps.</p><p>Let&apos;s consider, for example, the regular minor third at 288 cents<br/>(sometimes 289 cents) in O3. We have these unequal divisions:</p><p>0-138-288-496 (138-150) Moderate Persian Shur; Arab Bayyati; or Turkish Arazbar</p><p>0-150-288-496 (150-138)<br/>Turkish Ushshaq (~11-12-13 variety) or moderate Arab Huseyni</p><p>0-127-288-496 (127-162)<br/>Low Shur, with lots of contrast between neutral steps</p><p>0-162-288-496 (162-127)<br/>Turkish Huseyni, where first step really wants to be &gt;160 cents</p><p>Note that one advantage of an unequal division is that we can<br/>place the larger and smaller steps in either order, with subtly<br/>differing qualities.</p><p>And in Ozan&apos;s 79/80-MOS, we have yet more subtly varying sizes of<br/>neutral seconds; in O3 there are jumps of about 11-13 cents, or<br/>around half a comma, while in the 79/80-MOS the jumps are around<br/>1/159 octave or 1/3 comma, about 7.5 cents.</p><p>And in Scala, try George Secor&apos;s 17-WT (secor17wt.scl in the<br/>current archive), and do SHOW /LINE INTERVALS and see all of the<br/>graduated minor third sizes and divisions into neutral seconds!<br/>Some scale designer, that George Secor.</p><p>Best,</p><p>Margo</p></div><h3><a id=94485 href="#94485">ðŸ”—</a>Carl Lumma &#x3C;carl@...&#x3E;</h3><span>11/11/2010 8:17:14 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Hi Margo,</p><p>&gt; And &quot;justness&quot; may be less important than variety when we&apos;re<br/>&gt; talking about neutral second steps:</p><p>I completely agree.
