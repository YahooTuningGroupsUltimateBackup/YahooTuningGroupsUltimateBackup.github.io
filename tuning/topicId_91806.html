But then again, I would also imagine that has to<br/>do with their current conditioning.</p><p>&gt; &gt;&quot;6:7:9 is relaxing all of the time though.&quot;<br/>&gt; &nbsp; I agree it is very very relaxing sounding...but I&apos;m wondering why.&nbsp; It does seem to throw in a bit of everything as far as mood...but I wish I knew how so I could go and generate other chords with similar properties.&nbsp; The only thing that stares at me at first glance is that there in one prime (7) and the root has factors of both two and three....while meanwhile 4:5:6 has one prime (5) but the last note has two factors (again 2 and 3).&nbsp; Maybe having more factors in the root tone gives an advantage?&nbsp; Or...do you have any ideas &quot;why 6:7:9 works&quot;?</p><p>Well, it is the simplest triad, other than 4:5:6, that has a fifth on<br/>the outside. 10:12:15 beats it in terms of the consonance of each<br/>individual dyad, but 6:7:9 beats it in terms of the strength of the<br/>fundamental produced. Furthermore, 6:7 and 7:9 refer to the same tone,<br/>although 6:9 refers to 3. But for 10:12:15, all of the dyads refer to<br/>different fundamentals.</p><p>Whether 6:7:9 is &quot;more&quot; consonant than 10:12:15 I can&apos;t really say.<br/>I&apos;m not sure that it is. I think it just reflects a different &quot;type&quot;<br/>of consonance, or a different way of hearing, than 10:12:15. 6:7:9 is<br/>very consonant as a triad, and 10:12:15 is not, but has 3 very<br/>consonant dyads. And all of this is ignoring the diatonic template<br/>stuff I mentioned earlier.</p><p>-Mike</p></div>
