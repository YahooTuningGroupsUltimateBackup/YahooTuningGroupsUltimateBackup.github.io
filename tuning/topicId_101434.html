It makes possible<br/>9/7-11/9-9/7 chords that span an octave. That&apos;s about as efficient as<br/>a temperament could ever hope to get.</p><p>I happened upon it after lots and lots of meditation in &quot;Uncle&quot;<br/>temperament, ultimately realizing that the blend of 4:5:6 and 7:9:11<br/>was what I enjoyed about it so much. It&apos;s supported by 11, 14, 17, 20,<br/>etc equal. 11 and 17 are special in that they extend this to the<br/><a href="http://2.7.9.11">2.7.9.11</a> subgroup; one good temperament for this subgroup is<br/>machine[6], which splits the generator in half and tempers out 64/63<br/>as well. Machine could also be said to be 2-superpyth, using the<br/>nomenclature for subtemperaments I laid out on tuning-math recently.</p><p>Graham complexity of 2... unbelievable!</p><p>-Mike</p></div><h3><a id=101435 href="#101435">ðŸ”—</a>Petr Par&#xED;zek &#x3C;petrparizek2000@...&#x3E;</h3><span>8/27/2011 3:36:05 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>The temperament looks interesting, although I still think that the 2D version of Bohlen-Pierce (which tempers out 245/243) is unbeatable.<br/>Next I&apos;d put the one you were referring to; then the one with the 11/8-like generator; and then probably my &quot;triharmonic&quot; system where the period is 4/1 and the generator is the 9th root of 32/5.</p><p>Petr</p></div><h3><a id=101436 href="#101436">ðŸ”—</a>Mike Battaglia &#x3C;battaglia01@...&#x3E;</h3><span>8/27/2011 3:40:55 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>On Sat, Aug 27, 2011 at 6:36 AM, Petr Par&iacute;zek &lt;petrparizek2000@...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; The temperament looks interesting, although I still think that the 2D<br/>&gt; version of Bohlen-Pierce (which tempers out 245/243) is unbeatable.</p><p>Unbeatable from what standpoint, comma pumps?
