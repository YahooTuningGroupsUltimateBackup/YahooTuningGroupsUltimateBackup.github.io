For example, one 14th-century<br/>scheme has a final cadence on F with ascending semitones, and a<br/>sectional cadence on A, a third higher, with a descending semitone:</p><p>Final cadence (_clos_)            Internal cadence (_ouvert_)</p><p>     E4  F4                              G4   A4<br/>     B3  C4                              D4   E4<br/>     G3  F3                              Bb3  A3</p><p>Here _ouvert_ is French for an &quot;open&quot; or inconclusive ending, and<br/>_clos_ for a &quot;close&quot; or conclusive ending. Note the fluidity of the<br/>degree B/Bb (or German H/B), fitting the &quot;closest approach&quot; rule that<br/>thirds expanding to fifths or sixths to octaves should be major.</p><p>Looking at some 13th-century motets, or some 14th-century pieces by<br/>Machaut or Landini, might illustrate these points -- it&apos;s easy to give<br/>examples of cadences, but reading through a score or hearing a<br/>complete piece can give a much better feeling for form and style, to<br/>say the least.

This is another side of the general<br/>preference for directed resolutions of unstable intervals involving<br/>stepwise or near-conjunct contrary motion.</p><p>By the way, in response to your dialogue with Paul, I tend to regard the<br/>Halberstadt keyboard as a slice of Pythagorean or something similar in a<br/>Gothic/neo-Gothic setting (a not unhistorical view, given its 14th-century<br/>provenance), and as a slice of meantone in a Renaissance setting.</p><p>Possibly this suggests that conventions can and should vary depending on<br/>the intonational style and setting.
