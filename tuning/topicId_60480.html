If you mean<br/>Kraig Grady, he&apos;s out of LA.  I know piano tuners that will<br/>tune your piano in JI, but you might consider doing it yourself.<br/>Unlike ET, JI is very easy to tune (well, depending on what<br/>sort of JI you want)... I could walk you through it.</p><p>If you want to go back to ET later, it&apos;s no problem, though you<br/>might want to pick a JI scale that&apos;s not too far from ET.  And<br/>it usually takes 2-3 tunings to really lock in new tuning on a<br/>piano.</p><p>-Carl</p></div><h3><a id=60515 href="#60515">ðŸ”—</a>Jeremy Hunt &#x3C;jrmy@berkeley.edu&#x3E;</h3><span>9/13/2005 1:02:55 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>I know of a few that play with some of the early music groups in the area.

There are a lot of possible variations, but the<br/>general idea of discarding harmonics 11 and 13 from the lower register is I<br/>believe quite useful if you can keep track of it since it opens up the<br/>5-limit modulation possibilities a bit.</p><p>Kelly, if you end up putting a tuning like this on your piano, keep in mind<br/>that the the &quot;11&quot; pitches will be around a half-semitone sharp of equal<br/>temperament.  Maybe that is something you&apos;d want to be careful about with<br/>piano strings, if the piano is of any value.  You could work around it by<br/>flatting the whole scale a bit, but maybe even that poses some risk if you<br/>later bring the tuning back closer to ET, I don&apos;t know.</p><p>Whatever just tuning you get put on your piano, I hope you let us know when<br/>it is done, and invite all the locals over to hear it!</p><p>-Kurt</p></div><h3><a id=60687 href="#60687">ðŸ”—</a>Kraig Grady &#x3C;kraiggrady@anaphoria.com&#x3E;</h3><span>9/20/2005 4:59:29 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>I likewise had mentioned Canwrights 12 tone scales as excellent 12 tone tunings</p><p>  From: &quot;wallyesterpaulrus&quot; &lt;<a href="mailto:wallyesterpaulrus@yahoo.com">wallyesterpaulrus@yahoo.com</a>&gt;<br/>Subject: Re: SF Bay Area JI piano tuner (Carl Lumma?)</p><p>The original poster made mention of chords with primes as high as 13 on the harmonic entropy list -- perhaps one of the 12-note 13-limit tunings (Dave Canright&apos;s or others) might be best for him.</p><p>--<br/>Kraig Grady<br/>North American Embassy of Anaphoria Island &lt;<a href="http://anaphoria.com/">http://anaphoria.com/</a>&gt;<br/>The Wandering Medicine Show<br/>KXLU &lt;<a href="http://www.kxlu.com/main.html">http://www.kxlu.com/main.html</a>&gt; 88.9 FM Wed 8-9 pm Los Angeles</p></div><h3><a id=60691 href="#60691">ðŸ”—</a>Carl Lumma &#x3C;clumma@yahoo.com&#x3E;</h3><span>9/20/2005 8:17:55 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>I mentioned them before either of you -- big whoop.</p><p>-Carl</p><p>&gt;&gt; I likewise had mentioned Canwrights 12 tone scales as excellent 12<br/>&gt;&gt; tone tunings<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; The original poster made mention of chords with primes as high as 13<br/>&gt; on the harmonic entropy list -- perhaps one of the 12-note 13-limit<br/>&gt; tunings (Dave Canright&apos;s or others) might be best for him.</p></div><h3><a id=60697 href="#60697">ðŸ”—</a>George D.
