I&apos;m learning about<br/>the basics, interested in 22TET, Bohlen-Pierce, and learning a little<br/>about Indian music. So, I&apos;m talking to my brother tonight about<br/>the modular analog synthesizers that he&apos;s started making and selling.<br/>See his web page at:</p><p><a href="http://www.synthesizers.com">http://www.synthesizers.com</a></p><p>  I ask him what it would take to change to various equal tempered<br/>tunings (24TET was the obvious first choice to play with). And he<br/>has a module to allow you to modify voltages and such. So we retune<br/>the synth in 5 minutes to 24TET. Great, quartertones! So, I play a<br/>little and retune it to Bohlen-Pierce (13TET of the 3:1). Works<br/>like a charm. Equal tempered tunings are simple with this one add-on<br/>module in the system. His synth can also be MIDI driven and accepts<br/>and uses pitch bend, so that&apos;s another way to do things. (BTW,<br/>this is a monophonic analog synth; you can feed multiple voltages<br/>per key so you can do constant chords and such, if you like.)</p><p>  But what about unequal temperaments (historical temperaments,<br/>just intonation, etc.)? Well, after we talk a while, we figure out<br/>a way to do it. But he wonders who would be interested in such a<br/>thing? It wouldn&apos;t be worth it if he only sold 1 a year or whatever.<br/>There needs to be a market for this. The synths are available now,<br/>but specific microtonal support isn&apos;t built in yet (except for the<br/>Q125 Signal Processor, which is what we used to do the rough<br/>version of the other equal temperaments).</p><p>  So, are you interested in NEW, amazing analog synths? Are you a<br/>microtonalist or interested in playing historical works in their<br/>original tunings on a synthesizer? Check out his web page, and<br/>see if you can give me some answers to these questions:</p><p>1) What tunings would you be specifically interested in for this<br/>synthesizer system (maybe your top 10, if there are that many)?<br/>2) Do you need unequal temperament support or will you only be<br/>using equal temperaments?<br/>3) If you play in historical temperaments, name which ones.<br/>4) The microtonal addition to the system could add about US$100.00<br/>to the price of the synth. Is this a problem?<br/>5) Would programmability matter? If you were given something like<br/>50 temperaments, equal and non-equal, would that be enough, or would<br/>you need to create your own?</p><p>Any other information or suggestions you may have, please let me<br/>know.

We played around with 24TET<br/>and Bohlen-Pierce the other night.</p><p>&gt; &gt;2) Do you need unequal temperament support or will you only be<br/>&gt; &gt;using equal temperaments?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Unequal temperaments would be a plus.</p><p>If my brother decides to do this microtonal support, unequal<br/>and equal temperaments will be supported.</p><p>&gt; &gt;4) The microtonal addition to the system could add about US$100.00<br/>&gt; &gt;to the price of the synth. Is this a problem?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Not even remotely.  But what&apos;s the cost of the synth?</p><p>It varies, of course, based on what you want; it is completely<br/>modular, has multiple case options, etc. Pre-built systems in<br/>cabinets range from $900 to $4000. Or you can buy modules<br/>piecemeal and put together whatever you want; most module prices<br/>are around the $80 area, with one much more expensive (the<br/>sequencer, at $490) and some cheaper (the noise source, at $50).</p><p>&gt; &gt;5) Would programmability matter? If you were given something like<br/>&gt; &gt;50 temperaments, equal and non-equal, would that be enough, or<br/>&gt; &gt;would you need to create your own?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I think I speak for most of us here when I say that programmability<br/>&gt; is a must.</p><p>This may be the tricky part. It would be pretty easy to sell a<br/>special keyboard with microtonal support, including ETs up to some<br/>arbitrary amount (haven&apos;t I heard of someone working in 131TET?) and<br/>a bunch (50+?) of unequal and special (i.e. Bohlen-Pierce) tunings<br/>which could be chosen and switched between quickly. This covers a lot<br/>of ground, but I know there are people who want to create their own<br/>tunings. This may be possible, but we need to talk about how to<br/>implement the programmability.</p><p>&gt; ...that may sound like a tall order, but if you want to sell analog<br/>&gt; synths to microtonalists, you&apos;ve at least got to match what we can<br/>&gt; already do with digital synths.  A generalized keyboard controller<br/>&gt; would easily put you over the top.</p><p>But some people don&apos;t want the &quot;clean, digital&quot; sound; they want<br/>analog. Now, some of them want microtonality, too. We&apos;re trying to<br/>figure out where the sets mix and how we can cover as much territory<br/>as easily as possible. There are plenty of things a digital synth<br/>will do that this won&apos;t (out of the box, that is). But this is an<br/>analog synth, and for those who want that sound, nothing else will<br/>do. :-)</p><p>Thank you very much for your suggestions. This is turning into an<br/>interesting project. :-)</p><p>Darin &quot;Basil&quot; Arrick<br/><a href="mailto:basil_arrick@yahoo.com">basil_arrick@yahoo.com</a></p><p>Catch 22!

They have a Control processor that I think<br/>&gt; does the same with the <a href="http://synthesizers.com">synthesizers.com</a> signal processor for getting<br/>&gt; equal-tempered tunings.<br/>&gt; Am I right?<br/>&gt; Thanks</p><p>Yes, it will do it assuming your analog synthesizer has the right interface.<br/>You&apos;ll need an analog synth with Volts/Octave interface and both CV/Gate Ins<br/>and Outs.  Even this is no guarantee that it&apos;ll work, however.  My old<br/>Octave Cat SRM had control voltage outputs that were unsampled, whenever you<br/>lifted the key the pitch dropped immediately.  You had to put a Sample &amp;<br/>Hold in the path as well.  I seem to recall having a problem with that, but<br/>as it was fifteen years ago I can&apos;t recall the details.  Best bet is to try<br/>it before investing the money.</p><p>John Loffink<br/><a href="mailto:microtonal@worldnet.att.net">microtonal@worldnet.att.net</a><br/>The Microtonal Synthesis Web Site<br/><a href="http://home.att.net/~microtonal">http://home.att.net/~microtonal</a></p></div>
