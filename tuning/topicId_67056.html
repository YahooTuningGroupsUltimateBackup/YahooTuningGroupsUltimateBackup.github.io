At least I&apos;m pretty sure they will, if I understand this<br/>right.</p><p>Full point being: recording this with a mic live where both 30 and 31<br/>are in the room together, the nonlinearity will happen at the mic and<br/>record 1K energy.</p><p>If recording with a system limited at 20K, this will happen still.</p><p>But recording separately will get two recordings of nothing, which<br/>will sum to nothing.</p><p>But a system limited at 40K will have THE SAME audible 1K whether<br/>recording both sounds live or overdubbed.  Therefore, 40K recording<br/>adds to 20K recording even below the 20K level.  See?</p></div>
