So I&apos;m not sure why you wrote &apos;unless<br/>there are other notes to clue you in&apos;.</p><p>Well... what I&apos;m thinking about here is that there may be a<br/>&apos;chordal harmonic entropy&apos; where specific *sets* of low-integer<br/>proportions are the &apos;target&apos;, with distribution curves<br/>surrounding both each of the members of a set (as in dyadic<br/>harmonic entropy) *and* the set as a whole (unique to tri-<br/>and higher-ads).</p><p>The &apos;target&apos; aspect of the set comes in when there is a<br/>perceivable numerary nexus, which causes the set to be perceived<br/>as a segment of the harmonic series, giving rise to the<br/>perception of a fundamental (whether present or not).<br/>In order for the numerary nexus to be perceived, the proportions<br/>of the set all need to be quite low-integer.</p><p>The prime factors (up to a still-undetermined but quite low<br/>limit, probably around 11, possibly much higher, probably<br/>extremely dependent on context) are the ones that carry the<br/>*unique* perceptual information within a given set of ratios,<br/>*as long as ALL the proportions are low-integer*.</p><p>For instance, any low-integer 5-prime-limit ratio can be thought<br/>of as the sum of other low-integer 5-prime-limit ratios, but<br/>11:8 doesn&apos;t fit aurally into that paradigm - it doesn&apos;t<br/>*sound* like any low-integer 5-limit ratio, or like any<br/>low-integer 7-limit ratio, for that matter.  Likewise with<br/>7:4 - it doesn&apos;t sound like any low-integer 3-, 5-, or 11-<br/>limit ratio.</p><p>I was going somewhere with this, but after doing some experiments,<br/>I lost track of my point, so I&apos;ll just post the results here.</p><p>I performed some listening tests on two triads, an 8:20:27<br/>and an 8:21:25.  Both of them sounded to me like they could<br/>be inversions of minor triads (but I have more to say on this<br/>below): in the first, the 27:8 is an &apos;8ve&apos; of the fundamental,<br/>and in the second, the 21:8 fills that function.</p><p>I don&apos;t perceive any unique &apos;25-ness&apos; or &apos;27-ness&apos; in either<br/>of them, which says to me that the odd-limit aspect does<br/>not pertain to integers this high in a chordal context.<br/>Partch said as much in his book decades ago.</p><p>At the same time, however, I don&apos;t perceive any specific<br/>&apos;7-ness&apos; or &apos;5-ness&apos; either.  All I hear in both cases is<br/>the relative consonance, but what&apos;s really interesting is<br/>that the 8:21:25 *clearly* sounds like a &apos;minor&apos; chord, while<br/>the 8:20:27 sounds a lot more like an incomplete &apos;major 6th&apos;<br/>chord (with the &apos;8&apos; giving the fundamental) than an inversion<br/>of a minor chord.</p><p>The only things I can ascribe this effect to are the following:</p><p>1) The 8:20:27 has the higher odd- and integer-limit, but the<br/>lower prime-limit (= 5).  The 8:21:25 has lower odd- and integer-<br/>limit, but higher prime-limit (= 7).  So perhaps the &apos;major-&apos;<br/>and &apos;minor-ness&apos; inhere in the prime-limit, or perhaps they<br/>inhere in these particular primes, 5 giving &apos;major&apos; and 7<br/>giving &apos;minor&apos; (and, had I included it, 11 giving &apos;neutral&apos;?).<br/>Of course, the 5-limit 10:12:15 certain *sounds* &apos;minor&apos;,<br/>so... uh... ???</p><p>2) Since 27 is 3^3, the &apos;strength&apos; of the 27:8 in reinforcing<br/>the fundamental &apos;8&apos; in the 8:20:27 triad appears to be based on<br/>the 3-prime-limit.  On the other hand, perhaps the &apos;major-ness&apos;<br/>I hear in this chord inheres in the 2:5 between the two lower<br/>notes; the fact that this is 14 cents narrower than the 12-tET<br/>version bothers me not a bit, because of course it&apos;s the &apos;sweet&apos;<br/>5-limit JI &apos;major 3rd&apos; (plus an &apos;8ve&apos;). The supposedly dissonant<br/>27:20 &apos;4th&apos; (~520 cents) on the top only bothers my sensitive ears<br/>in that it sounds too sharp. I&apos;d bet that this is because of<br/>conditioning, since I&apos;m used to hearing the 500-cent 2^(4/12)<br/>for this interval most of the time.</p><p>3) Similarly, in the 8:21:25 triad, the narrowness of the 21:8<br/>&apos;4th&apos; (1 &apos;8ve&apos; + ~471 cents) doesn&apos;t bother me, and the 25:21<br/>&apos;minor 3rd&apos; (~302 cents) on top sounds perfectly OK.  I suppose,<br/>again, that I&apos;m conditioned to hearing the 300-cent 2^(3/12)<br/>version of this interval, and 25:21 is very close to that.<br/>But why does the 7-limit narrow &apos;4th&apos; sound OK?  Hmmm...</p><p>Anyway, make of this what you will.  Feedback is appreciated.</p><p>&gt; [me, monz]<br/>&gt; &gt; The fact of the irreducibility of the primes hints to me that<br/>&gt; &gt; this procedure would rule out the artifacts resulting from<br/>&gt; &gt; multiple redundant representation of intervals within a given<br/>&gt; &gt; series.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; [Paul]<br/>&gt; Could you give an example of what you mean?</p><p>Hmmm... after thinking about it some more, perhaps I&apos;m really<br/>wrong with this, and what I really mean is exactly the opposite.</p><p>Remember my post the other day about the Voronoi diagram?  I<br/>mentioned how 3:4:5 is represented redundantly so many times<br/>within the 64-integer-limit.  This is because its factors are<br/>the three lowest primes: 2, 3, and 5, which means that more<br/>3-note sets of higher numbers will be multiples of these three<br/>particular notes than of any other set, which results in your<br/>Voronoi diagram having the largest cell for this triad.</p><p>I don&apos;t know... now I&apos;m really confused.  I still think the<br/>prime-factor lattice conveys clear harmonic information about<br/>tri-/higher-ads, but it&apos;s a gut feeling, that I&apos;m having<br/>trouble explaining.</p><p>The only thing I can say for sure, based on my own experience,<br/>is that discordance of tri-/higher-ads seems to be a function<br/>of the size of both the prime-factors *and* the exponents<br/>which make up the proportions of the chord, and that both<br/>of them need to go into the calculation. (don&apos;t ask me *which*<br/>calculation ;-)</p><p>-monz<br/><a href="http://www.ixpres.com/interval/monzo/homepage.html">http://www.ixpres.com/interval/monzo/homepage.html</a></p></div><h3><a id=13527 href="#13527">ðŸ”—</a>Monz &#x3C;MONZ@JUNO.COM&#x3E;</h3><span>9/25/2000 8:32:23 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@egroups.com">tuning@egroups.com</a>, &quot;Joseph Pehrson&quot; &lt;josephpehrson@c...&gt;<br/>wrote:<br/>&gt; --- In <a href="mailto:tuning@egroups.com">tuning@egroups.com</a>, &quot; Monz&quot; &lt;MONZ@J...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; <a href="http://www.egroups.com/message/tuning/13486">http://www.egroups.com/message/tuning/13486</a><br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; OK...

Here&apos;s the lattice:</p><p>     10 ---- 15<br/>    /  \    /<br/>   /    \  /<br/>  8 ---- 12</p><p>10 and 12 are both only one &apos;step&apos; away from the fundamental 8,<br/>on the 5- and 3-axes respectively.  Furthermore, these three<br/>proportions reduce to 4:5:6, the strongest tonal concordance<br/>possible with a tetrad of three distinct identities.  15 is<br/>2 steps away from the fundamental; you can get there by either<br/>of two &apos;routes&apos;: 8 - 10 - 15 or 8 - 12 - 15.  In either case,<br/>all relationships are concordant, thus reinforcing the 4:5:6<br/>concordance still further.  As Paul pointed out, the only<br/>discordant interval in this chord is the 8:15 between the<br/>&apos;major 7th&apos; and the &apos;root&apos;.</p><p>In the much more discordant 9:11:13:15 tetrad, the perceived<br/>(i.e., reinforced) fundamental is missing from the chord, and<br/>we have 9 (== 3^2) and 15 (= 3*5) both 2 steps away from it,<br/>and 11 and 13 both one step away from it.  I would say that<br/>this produces greater discordance.</p><p>Something else producing greater discordance in this chord,<br/>already pointed out by both Paul and myself, is the higher<br/>prime-limit.  This means that the periodicity between chord-<br/>members is lower: the largest interval, 9:15, reduces to<br/>3:5, which is a dyad with pretty high periodicity.  But<br/>the waveforms of the pitches in the dyads involving 11 and<br/>13 have much further to travel before they come back in phase.</p><p>But note that while this chord is more discordant than the one<br/>above, it&apos;s still not too &apos;bad&apos; to my ears, and certainly much<br/>more concordant than the following triad.  This is probably<br/>because the odd-limit (= 15) is still rather low, and the<br/>integers in the proportion are not much different from the<br/>ones in the first chord.</p><p>I&apos;d make a lattice, but it would be difficult following the<br/>triangular formula I used for the 5-limit ones, because of the<br/>number of different prime-axes (i.e., dimensions) involved.<br/>If I had used my own lattice formula, I would have drawn all<br/>three according to that.</p><p>Now look again at the lattice of the dissonant triad.<br/>I&apos;ll reproduce it here with the proportions instead of<br/>the ratios:</p><p>              625<br/>               /<br/>              /<br/>            ()<br/>            /<br/>           /<br/>         400<br/>         /<br/>        /<br/>      ()<br/>      /<br/>     /<br/>  512</p><p>It is indeed a 5-limit triad, as can be seen plainly here.<br/>There are several factors which I&apos;d say make it a highly<br/>discordant chord.</p><p>First, there are 2 or 4 steps along the 5-axis between all notes<br/>in the chord, with *none* of the notes only one step away from<br/>any other.  In this sense, it is much more discordant than<br/>either of the two previous chords.</p><p>Second - very closely related to the first point - to use numbers<br/>that give *integer* proportions between all chord-members (which<br/>is what causes the perception of an otonal fundamental) the<br/>numbers have to be quite high, which gives a bad score in the<br/>low-integer game.  It&apos;s obvious from comparing the proportions<br/>of all three chords that in this sense this one is *far* more<br/>discordant than the other two.</p><p>Third, the perceived otonal fundamental (= 512) *is* present in<br/>the chord but is *not* the note functioning as the &apos;chord root&apos;<br/>(= 400); this creates another kind of &apos;dissonance&apos; (that between<br/>perceived fundamental and functional chord-root) which I would<br/>say adds further to the discordance.</p><p>I might postulate my theory as one based on &apos;close-packing&apos;:<br/>the closer the lattice-points are to the fundamental, the<br/>more concordant the chord.  In my lattice formula, higher<br/>primes have longer spaces between steps along their axes<br/>and lower primes have shorter spaces, so 9 (at the second<br/>step on the 3-axis) is still closer to 1/1 than 11 (at the<br/>first step on the 11-axis), and is thus more concordant.</p><p>This property does not agree with my perceptions or Paul Erlich&apos;s<br/>in 100% of the cases, so my formula still needs fine-tuning<br/>(pun intended); but so far I find it more-or-less workable.</p><p>Does that make my theory clearer?

Both of them sounded to me like they could<br/>&gt;be inversions of minor triads (but I have more to say on this<br/>&gt;below): in the first, the 27:8 is an &apos;8ve&apos; of the fundamental,<br/>&gt;and in the second, the 21:8 fills that function.</p><p>&gt;I don&apos;t perceive any unique &apos;25-ness&apos; or &apos;27-ness&apos; in either<br/>&gt;of them, which says to me that the odd-limit aspect does<br/>&gt;not pertain to integers this high in a chordal context.<br/>&gt;Partch said as much in his book decades ago.</p><p>&gt;At the same time, however, I don&apos;t perceive any specific<br/>&gt;&apos;7-ness&apos; or &apos;5-ness&apos; either.</p><p>Glad you&apos;re being honest here!</p><p>&gt;All I hear in both cases is<br/>&gt;the relative consonance, but what&apos;s really interesting is<br/>&gt;that the 8:21:25 *clearly* sounds like a &apos;minor&apos; chord, while<br/>&gt;the 8:20:27 sounds a lot more like an incomplete &apos;major 6th&apos;<br/>&gt;chord (with the &apos;8&apos; giving the fundamental) than an inversion<br/>&gt;of a minor chord.</p><p>The only things I can ascribe this effect to are the following:</p><p>&gt;1) The 8:20:27 has the higher odd- and integer-limit, but the<br/>&gt;lower prime-limit (= 5).  The 8:21:25 has lower odd- and integer-<br/>&gt;limit, but higher prime-limit (= 7).  So perhaps the &apos;major-&apos;<br/>&gt;and &apos;minor-ness&apos; inhere in the prime-limit, or perhaps they<br/>&gt;inhere in these particular primes, 5 giving &apos;major&apos; and 7<br/>&gt;giving &apos;minor&apos; (and, had I included it, 11 giving &apos;neutral&apos;?).<br/>&gt;Of course, the 5-limit 10:12:15 certain *sounds* &apos;minor&apos;,<br/>&gt;so... uh... ???</p><p>&gt;2) Since 27 is 3^3, the &apos;strength&apos; of the 27:8 in reinforcing<br/>&gt;the fundamental &apos;8&apos; in the 8:20:27 triad appears to be based on<br/>&gt;the 3-prime-limit.  On the other hand, perhaps the &apos;major-ness&apos;<br/>&gt;I hear in this chord inheres in the 2:5 between the two lower<br/>&gt;notes; the fact that this is 14 cents narrower than the 12-tET<br/>&gt;version bothers me not a bit, because of course it&apos;s the &apos;sweet&apos;<br/>&gt;5-limit JI &apos;major 3rd&apos; (plus an &apos;8ve&apos;). The supposedly dissonant<br/>&gt;27:20 &apos;4th&apos; (~520 cents) on the top only bothers my sensitive ears<br/>&gt;in that it sounds too sharp. I&apos;d bet that this is because of<br/>&gt;conditioning, since I&apos;m used to hearing the 500-cent 2^(4/12)<br/>&gt;for this interval most of the time.</p><p>&gt;3) Similarly, in the 8:21:25 triad, the narrowness of the 21:8<br/>&gt;&apos;4th&apos; (1 &apos;8ve&apos; + ~471 cents) doesn&apos;t bother me, and the 25:21<br/>&gt;&apos;minor 3rd&apos; (~302 cents) on top sounds perfectly OK.  I suppose,<br/>&gt;again, that I&apos;m conditioned to hearing the 300-cent 2^(3/12)<br/>&gt;version of this interval, and 25:21 is very close to that.<br/>&gt;But why does the 7-limit narrow &apos;4th&apos; sound OK?  Hmmm...</p><p>&gt;Anyway, make of this what you will.  Feedback is appreciated.</p><p>Nothing in the above suggests any importance in prime limit to triadic<br/>discordance beyond its importance in diadic discordance, nor do you want to<br/>ascribe any importance in prime limit to diadic discordance, do you?</p><p>&gt;Hmmm... after thinking about it some more, perhaps I&apos;m really<br/>&gt;wrong with this, and what I really mean is exactly the opposite.</p><p>&gt;I don&apos;t know... now I&apos;m really confused.  I still think the<br/>&gt;prime-factor lattice conveys clear harmonic information about<br/>&gt;tri-/higher-ads, but it&apos;s a gut feeling, that I&apos;m having<br/>&gt;trouble explaining.</p><p>Yes, the Tenney prime lattice, with 2 included, is the best way to map<br/>pitches according to diadic consonance.</p><p>&gt;The only thing I can say for sure, based on my own experience,<br/>&gt;is that discordance of tri-/higher-ads seems to be a function<br/>&gt;of the size of both the prime-factors *and* the exponents<br/>&gt;which make up the proportions of the chord, and that both<br/>&gt;of them need to go into the calculation. (don&apos;t ask me *which*<br/>&gt;calculation ;-)</p><p>Monz, we can actually come to an agreement here --</p><p>*the numbers in each diad, triad, and tetrad can be written as a function of<br/>the prime factors and their exponents in a trivial way -- since you can<br/>factorize any number.</p><p>*For simple JI chords, the discordance is a function of the size of the<br/>numbers in each diad, triad, and tetrad.</p><p>*For other chords, you need to take tolerance into account.</p><p>That&apos;s it, there&apos;s nothing more to it.</p></div><h3><a id=13537 href="#13537">ðŸ”—</a>Paul H.
