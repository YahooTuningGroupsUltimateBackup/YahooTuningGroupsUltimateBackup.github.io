<a href="/tuning">back to list</a><h1>Future of this list</h1><h3>Margo Schulter &#x3C;mschulter@...&#x3E;</h3><span>10/28/2010 4:45:09 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Hello, all,</p><p>Please note that I&apos;m making this the beginning of a new thread,<br/>on the future of the tuning list, because the topic does seem to<br/>me distinct from Jake&apos;s fine &quot;newbie&quot; questions. Of course, Jake,<br/>this isn&apos;t in any way to discourage your participation, because<br/>we could use some fresh viewpoints and perspectives, and the<br/>friendliness of the list to newcomers is one cardinal test of<br/>value.</p><p>----------------------<br/>1. Civility is the key<br/>----------------------</p><p>First, I do believe on the basis of participating here over the<br/>last 12 years or so (not continuously, but often) that civility<br/>is the glue that holds our community together!</p><p>Secondly, I also believe that it is possible to conduct<br/>discussions or even spirited debates with mutual respect, as much<br/>as the ideal is often contradicted in experience, for example in<br/>some of the printed debates of historical European music theory<br/>around 1600 which can be very &quot;exciting&quot; to read both for the<br/>musical ideas and some of the mutual (or sometimes unilateral)<br/>unpleasantries. Whatever effect this may have on musical<br/>literature, I consider such clashes of personalities, rather than<br/>ideas, as harmful to a community such as ours.</p><p>----------------------------------<br/>2. Libraries or the Web: both/and!<br/>----------------------------------</p><p>Also, I would personally consider it self-evident that both<br/>libraries (or other sources of printed material) and online<br/>resources are invaluable and indispensable means for learning<br/>about world musical traditions and tuning systems. As Cris has<br/>said, a library is a unique kind of three-dimemsional space, and<br/>I suspect that my experiences in libraries in the decades before<br/>the advent of a popularly accessible Internet and World Wide Web<br/>have lent a richer perspective to my use of these newer<br/>resources.</p><p>While I&apos;m not sure if my perspective is quite the same as yours,<br/>Cris, I do share in the caution of many librarians that makes<br/>your remarks so vital: &quot;Browsing the Web, we can easily be<br/>impressed by the wealth of resources, hopefully also taking note<br/>of the unevenness of quality: but always keep in mind that this<br/>is just the tip of the iceberg! A vast store of knowledge remains<br/>available only in print, and much of the best today is being<br/>published in print, and not, at least instantly, on the Web!&quot;</p><p>Does this make the Web less important? Of course not! And as<br/>Google Books and others digitize more and more public domain<br/>sources for ready access, the Web will become yet more useful and<br/>versatile. But still, there&apos;s also the vast world of printed<br/>resources.</p><p>Of course, where you go in what order may depend in part on where<br/>you live, or more concretely on how close a library is located,<br/>or more specifically one with the sources you&apos;re looking for (a<br/>list that changes as our research and learning proceeds, of<br/>course). Interlibrary loans can indeed help, with the specific<br/>utility depending on the policies of the relevant libraries.</p><p>------------------------------------------------------<br/>3. Cultural sensitivity: Near Eastern music and theory<br/>------------------------------------------------------</p><p>One key to the future of this group, it seems to me, is for<br/>intellectually provocative statements to receive spirited and<br/>civil responses. The process can be fun and educational, although<br/>I especially appreciate that certain comments, intentionally or<br/>otherwise, can convey cultural biases which cry out for a<br/>response. And in such circumstances, civility can be an exacting<br/>test.</p><p>For example, in my view, al-Farabi&apos;s &quot;Mode of Zalzal&quot; (to follow<br/>your usage, Cris) would likely serve as a stylish modern Egyptian<br/>Rast (or more specifically Nairuz Rast, the conjunct form with<br/>neutral sixth and minor seventh); while we seem much in<br/>agreement, Cris, that Ibn Sina&apos;s 17-note lute tuning makes<br/>available, for example, a fine Shur a la Farhat on the 3/2 step<br/>(or the 9/8 step if we map Ibn Sina&apos;s 4/3 to the 1/1 of Farhat&apos;s<br/>system for the closest fit). And Safi al-Din al-Urmawi and Qutb<br/>al-Din al=Shirazi describe Buzurg pentachords with lower<br/>tetrachords rather closely fitting one measured modern flavor of<br/>Turkish Hijaz. Of course, Cris, I&apos;ll need to read your book to<br/>get your view on Ibn Sina and Farhat (your PDF of the index tells<br/>me the pages), but I think that we&apos;ll mostly be in agreement on<br/>the main points.</p><p>Carl, I&apos;m not sure if your stated view discounting Ptolemy and<br/>the medieval Islamic theorists is a bit of &quot;devil&apos;s advocacy,&quot; a<br/>null hypothesis meant to invite creative refutations, or a fully<br/>earnest assertion.</p><p>In fact, I apologize for not being more responsive to some<br/>previous questions you have asked, for example on the concept of<br/>the 17 basic steps or perdeler in Turkish theory. I&apos;ll try to<br/>explain this a bit -- or, at least, my own idiosyncratic and<br/>nonnative perspective. However, someone like Ozan, or Amine<br/>Beyhom or Ali Jihad Racy, can give a very sophisticated<br/>perspective from squarely inside the tradition.</p><p>Here I might cite both printed books and articles, and materials<br/>such as dissertations available in whole or part on the Web. Karl<br/>Signell on _Makam: Modal Practice in Turkish Art Music_ gives<br/>some measurements in cents as well as fascinating insights as to<br/>comma distinctions which are important. The studies of Can Akkoc,<br/>Ozan Yarman, and others, further enrich these insights as to<br/>medieval and more recent theory, and actual practice.</p><p>In Persian music, Hormoz Farhat is indeed one source; and I&apos;d<br/>warmly recommend also Nelly Caron and Dariouche Safvate; Jean<br/>During; and Dariush Tala&grave;i.</p><p>In the Arab world, Amine Beyhom&apos;s thesis on modal systematics is<br/>available in large part (hundreds of pages) on the Web, as well<br/>as some articles discussing actual intonational practice and the<br/>question of cultural authenticity. Ali Jihad Racy and his student<br/>Scott Marcus (who also studied with some masters in Cairo and<br/>observed subtleties of traditional performers missed in current<br/>Egyptian conservatory theory) describe some important nuances<br/>like the placing of the Arab sikah step lower as the neutral<br/>second of Maqam Bayyati than as the neutral third of Maqam Rast,<br/>and the practice of some musicians of tuning the minor third of<br/>Bayyati at _narrower_ than a Pythagorean 32/27 or 294 cents.</p><p>Part of this, of course, may be a question of outlook and<br/>attitude. Early in my collaboration as a relative newcomer to the<br/>tuning scene with a most wise an experienced mentor, George<br/>Secor, he proposed a tempered tuning, a subset of his 17-tone<br/>well-temperament of 1978 which we were exploring, which suggested<br/>to me a variation I very much liked. Using Scala showed me that<br/>it was very similar to a diatonic of Ibn Sina almost a millennium<br/>earlier!</p><p>An appraisal of Ptolemy, al-Farabi, Safi al-Din, Qutb al-Din and<br/>other musicians and theorists using complex rational ratios,<br/>Carl, can get into some culturally delicate territory. I think<br/>some aspects of the question might include conventional 18th-19th<br/>century European harmony versus primarily melodic styles where<br/>neutral intervals are a basic part of the vocabulary. This<br/>doesn&apos;t mean that all Near Eastern musicians think, sing, or play<br/>alike -- far from it! But it does mean that a cursory dismissal<br/>of five centuries or so of sophisticated theory, and a proposal<br/>(which evidently wasn&apos;t as broad as some people read it) to<br/>reduce everything to 24-EDO or the like, seems a curious starting<br/>point for a balanced dialogue.</p><p>To reverse roles in this cause celebre, let&apos;s suppose that I, as<br/>a Near Eastern musician (in fact I&apos;m just a beginning student<br/>from another culture, and a &quot;student&quot; only a very qualified sense<br/>since I haven&apos;t had any oral instruction with a master, although<br/>Ozan and Shaahin Mohajeri, among others, have taught me a great<br/>deal!), observed that distinctions between historical European<br/>tuning systems are really trivial for the most part, because<br/>today we hear music originally conceived for Pythagorean<br/>intonation, meantone or 5-limit JI, and unequal well-temperaments<br/>or the like all played indifferently in 12-EDO! Thus the greats<br/>from Jacobus of Liege and Johannes de Muris and Philippe de Vitry<br/>to Ramos, Gaffurius, Vicentino, Zarlino, Lippius, Colonna,<br/>Mersenne, Werckmeister, Huygens, etc., etc., were mostly either<br/>playing &quot;numbers games,&quot; engaging in creative fantasies of pure<br/>theory, or describing &quot;variations&quot; on 12-EDO.</p><p>It is, of course, quite possible to perform meantone keyboard<br/>repertory in 12-EDO, or to perform maqamat or dastgah-ha in<br/>24-EDO. It happens: but should it be considered the norm to the<br/>exclusion of more intricate and sophisticated practice and<br/>theory, medieval and modern.</p><p>The question of &quot;Theory vs. Practice&quot; is indeed a refrain both<br/>with Signell and with Turkish musicians and theorists such as<br/>Yarman and Akkoc, not speak of Beyhom, a Lebanese scholar<br/>interested in Turkish as well as Arab intonations. And we find<br/>that actual, real-world musicians paint a more intricate and<br/>complex picture than most existing theory would suggest.</p><p>Some of this is common sense. When I look at Ozan&apos;s measurements<br/>of a performance in Maqam Ushshak and see something like<br/>123-137-228 cents, it&apos;s not hard for me to think &quot;28:26:24:21&quot;<br/>and Ibn Sina&apos;s steps of 14;13-13:12-8:7, although the 14:13 and<br/>8:7 steps are a bit narrow (the latter like a Pythagorean double<br/>apotome), the 7:6 step more so, and the fourth yet more so with<br/>respect to 4:3. Yet I&apos;d think &quot;Ibn Sina&apos;s tetrachord of<br/>28:26:24:21, or, according to Ozan&apos;s reading, a permutation of<br/>12:13:14:16&quot; long before I&apos;d consider 12-EDO or 24-EDO!</p><p>The topic becomes yet more sensitive, if treated in an overly<br/>cursory manner, because in fact 24-EDO keybaord instruments and<br/>&quot;Western&quot; misconceptions and oversimplifications are making<br/>classic Near Eastern refinements and nuances an endangered<br/>species. Racy discusses this at some length in his _Making Music<br/>in the Arab World: The Culture and Artistry of Tarab_.</p><p>Similarly if, _on the tuning list_, a place where a lover of<br/>16th-century European meantone might expect a congenial<br/>atmosphere, someone were to declare that meantone is evidently a<br/>theoretical abstraction since it was &quot;so easily replaced in only<br/>a few centuries by 12-EDO,&quot; we might expect either some sparks to<br/>fly in ways which might generate more heat than light, or people<br/>who love meantone to seek a different group.</p><p>Of all places, the tuning list should be a friendly and<br/>respectful forum for musicians of all cultural origins and<br/>interests who come together to celebrate our diverse traditions<br/>and discoveries. Patience and respect can be mutually<br/>reinforcing.</p><p>At times it is suggested that electronic discussion forums have<br/>outlived their usefulness -- a statement which, as also the<br/>similar assertion for printed books, I take to be premature!</p><p>Let&apos;s make it so.</p><p>Most respectfully,</p><p>Margo Schulter<br/>mschulter@...</p></div><h3>Michael &#x3C;djtrancendance@...&#x3E;</h3><span>10/28/2010 7:37:06 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Margo&gt;&quot;distinctions between historical European tuning systems are really<br/>trivial for the most part, because<br/>today we hear music originally conceived for Pythagorean intonation, meantone or<br/>5-limit JI, and unequal well-temperaments or the like all played indifferently<br/>in 12-EDO!&quot;</p><p>   Exactly...if I heard you correctly, they all seem close enough to<br/>Pythagorean...which begs examples such as...</p><p>&gt;&quot;Thus the greats from Jacobus of Liege and Johannes de Muris and Philippe de<br/>&gt;Vitry<br/>to Ramos, Gaffurius, Vicentino, Zarlino, Lippius, Colonna, Mersenne,<br/>Werckmeister, Huygens, etc., etc., were mostly either playing &quot;numbers games,&quot;<br/>engaging in creative fantasies of pure theory, or describing &quot;variations&quot; on<br/>12-EDO.&quot;<br/>    ....Which seems to imply, quite clearly, how hypocritical an idea it is to<br/>say Ptolemy and Islamic theorists were playing &quot;numbers games&quot; any more than the<br/>&quot;masters of diatonic theory&quot; are/were!</p><p>&quot;One key to the future of this group, it seems to me, is for intellectually<br/>provocative statements to receive &gt;spirited and civil responses. &quot;.......&quot;Carl,<br/>I&apos;m not sure if your stated view discounting Ptolemy and the &gt;medieval Islamic<br/>theorists is a bit of &quot;devil&apos;s advocacy,&quot; a null hypothesis meant to invite<br/>creative &gt;refutations, or a fully earnest assertion.&quot;....</p><p>    So it seems are major topic on the table that could be expanded as<br/>&quot;intellectually provocative&quot; is the idea of things like the &quot;crazy&quot; works of<br/>Ptolemy, Al-Farabi, and more being taken as serious and different alternatives<br/>for (not replacements of!) things like 24TET in the same way even masters such<br/>as Huygens took slants on things ultimately related fairly closely to<br/>Pythagorean tuning.  BTW, personal opinion, I think 31TET can be used to capture<br/>the feel of both &quot;Arabesque&quot; 24TET and &quot;Pythagorean-based&quot; mean-tone because it<br/>contains so many very-near-common-intervals from each one of those systems.</p><p>  Which goes back to the point of ...Carl, are you up for being civil in letting<br/>such discussions evolve rather than saying the topic introducing person is crazy<br/>and/or (whether intentional or not) derailing the topic?

That goes with<br/>Mike&apos;s recent post here about how everything from<br/>meantone to superpythag sounds, functionally in some way,<br/>the same.

I&apos;m rambling, but I guess my point is:</p><p>1. it depends how you look at it</p><p>2. we should drop the culture wars and discuss reality<br/>on this small planet with a singleminded love for the<br/>truth, and for no other</p><p>3. when you say it&apos;s &quot;ennobling&quot; to use rationals, I<br/>must say, that&apos;s a head-scratcher for me</p><p>&gt; The topic becomes yet more sensitive, if treated in an overly<br/>&gt; cursory manner, because in fact 24-EDO keybaord instruments and<br/>&gt; &quot;Western&quot; misconceptions and oversimplifications are making<br/>&gt; classic Near Eastern refinements and nuances an endangered<br/>&gt; species. Racy discusses this at some length in his _Making Music<br/>&gt; in the Arab World: The Culture and Artistry of Tarab_.</p><p>I understand this is a hot topic, but on the other hand,<br/>if musicians accept and use a tool, that ought to be, on<br/>some level, evidence that it&apos;s working for them.</p><p>However I do understand the counterargument: I can think<br/>of my native area in Pennsylvania, where the local language<br/>(Pennsylvania Dutch) is endangered.  Some of my friends&apos;<br/>grandfathers spoke it.  It is hard to make the case to my<br/>friends that they are fools for not learning it and<br/>continuing to speak it.  But it is also hard to say that<br/>nothing is being lost.</p><p>&gt; Similarly if, _on the tuning list_, a place where a lover of<br/>&gt; 16th-century European meantone might expect a congenial<br/>&gt; atmosphere, someone were to declare that meantone is evidently a<br/>&gt; theoretical abstraction since it was &quot;so easily replaced in only<br/>&gt; a few centuries by 12-EDO,&quot; we might expect either some sparks to<br/>&gt; fly in ways which might generate more heat than light, or people<br/>&gt; who love meantone to seek a different group.</p><p>Of course this attitude is very common among musicians,<br/>even today.

I should<br/>have said this when the topic came up earlier.</p><p>Also, I much enjoyed your story of Joseph Spencer. And certainly I&apos;d<br/>see 12-EDO for Elizabethan music on keyboard, or 24-EDO for Near<br/>Eastern music, as part of a microtonal continuum.

Mea<br/>&gt; culpa!<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; In short, you&apos;re absolutely right to point this out, and I want to<br/>&gt; lend you my agreement as the one who should have chosen her words more<br/>&gt; carefully as well as logically:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt; An appraisal of Ptolemy, al-Farabi, Safi al-Din, Qutb al-Din and<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt; other musicians and theorists using complex rational ratios,<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt; Carl, can get into some culturally delicate territory. I think<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt; some aspects of the question might include conventional 18th-19th<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt; century European harmony versus primarily melodic styles where<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt; neutral intervals are a basic part of the vocabulary. This<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt; doesn&apos;t mean that all Near Eastern musicians think, sing, or play<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt; alike -- far from it! But it does mean that a cursory dismissal<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt; of five centuries or so of sophisticated theory, and a proposal<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt; (which evidently wasn&apos;t as broad as some people read it) to<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt; reduce everything to 24-EDO or the like, seems a curious starting<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt; point for a balanced dialogue.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt; I didn&apos;t say it&apos;s all reducible to 24!  In fact I explicitly said<br/>&gt;&gt; the opposite in just about every message I&apos;ve posted on the subject.<br/>&gt;&gt; See for instance:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt; [86]<a href="http://groups.yahoo.com/group/tuning/message/90373">http://groups.yahoo.com/group/tuning/message/90373</a><br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt; [87]<a href="http://groups.yahoo.com/group/tuning/message/93693">http://groups.yahoo.com/group/tuning/message/93693</a><br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; When I say &quot;carefully as well as logically,&quot; I mean that &quot;a proposal<br/>&gt; to reduce everything to 24-EDO&quot; is either exactly that broad, or isn&apos;t<br/>&gt; in fact a proposal to reduce &quot;everything&quot; to 24-EDO in the first<br/>&gt; place! And yours wasn&apos;t, which isn&apos;t a &quot;sort of&quot; type of distinction.<br/>&gt; The fact that someone may read anything on the tuning list to mean<br/>&gt; almost anything doesn&apos;t mean that rules of logic and accuracy have no<br/>&gt; value here.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; As a partial reparation, I hope, I&apos;m posting my explanation on the 17<br/>&gt; steps of Turkish theory, although my perspective may be closer to<br/>&gt; Amine Beyhom, who recently has written in favor of a flexible &quot;grid&quot;<br/>&gt; of 17 thirdtones in describing some measured performances. This<br/>&gt; doesn&apos;t imply 17-EDO, any more than a theory of &quot;24 positions&quot;<br/>&gt; neecssarily implies 24-EDO. However -- and this is me, not Near<br/>&gt; Easterm musicians! -- it is true that when I try to look at my usual<br/>&gt; maqam temperaments in Scala, the EDO that returns the most applicable<br/>&gt; note spellings does happen to be 17!<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; A couple of other quick points.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; First, Beyhom is indeed in French, and my comprehension is often<br/>&gt; partial, but enough comes through to be more than worthwhile for me,<br/>&gt; which might suggest that my reading comprehension is fortunately a tad<br/>&gt; better than my attempts at pronunciation! Some of the mathematical<br/>&gt; figures, at any rate, could be of interest, and I&apos;d offer to help,<br/>&gt; however imperfect my understanding of French, if I could. I should<br/>&gt; have said this when the topic came up earlier.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Also, I much enjoyed your story of Joseph Spencer. And certainly I&apos;d<br/>&gt; see 12-EDO for Elizabethan music on keyboard, or 24-EDO for Near<br/>&gt; Eastern music, as part of a microtonal continuum. In my longer<br/>&gt; article, I say more about that continuum, and curiously while<br/>&gt; generally avoiding rational ratios for neutral or other complex<br/>&gt; intervals, if simply to show that yes, it can be done.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Best,<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Margo<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; ------------------------------------<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; You can configure your subscription by sending an empty email to one<br/>&gt; of these addresses (from the address at which you receive the list):<br/>&gt;    <a href="mailto:tuning-subscribe@yahoogroups.com">tuning-subscribe@yahoogroups.com</a> - join the tuning group.<br/>&gt;    <a href="mailto:tuning-unsubscribe@yahoogroups.com">tuning-unsubscribe@yahoogroups.com</a> - leave the group.<br/>&gt;    <a href="mailto:tuning-nomail@yahoogroups.com">tuning-nomail@yahoogroups.com</a> - turn off mail from the group.<br/>&gt;    <a href="mailto:tuning-digest@yahoogroups.com">tuning-digest@yahoogroups.com</a> - set group to send daily digests.<br/>&gt;    <a href="mailto:tuning-normal@yahoogroups.com">tuning-normal@yahoogroups.com</a> - set group to send individual emails.<br/>&gt;    <a href="mailto:tuning-help@yahoogroups.com">tuning-help@yahoogroups.com</a> - receive general help information.<br/>&gt; Yahoo!

(Oz, did not you ask for moderation of Michael S.??)&quot;</p><p>    The never ending saga of this list...someone (IE me) complains about<br/>flaming, someone (IE Carl) blames me for starting it, someone else (IE Ozan)<br/>takes Carl&apos;s words as gospel.  Perhaps the good thing is...I think Ozan is<br/>finally beginning to realize who was/is really starting most of the the flame<br/>wars and side-tracking the most threads...and it&apos;s not me. :-)</p><p>           On the side, I am &quot;guilty&quot; of introducing topics that have YET to<br/>achieve academic backing (as are/were people such as Marcel)...but what can<br/>people like us do within our power to counter this (beside randomly giving up)?!<br/>           In other words, how are we supposed to earn (or at least get a fair<br/>chance for) academic backing if people like Carl literally call me a troll when<br/>I try to do a survey or call when a do survey 4 people &quot;pathetic&quot;...hey it&apos;s not<br/>exactly my fault I can only test a theory I have with a limited number of<br/>willing subjects!<br/>           Now if the tuning list has an &quot;anti-survey&quot; policy to its members I<br/>could understand...but since it doesn&apos;t the way it seems to handle attempts at<br/>surveying any new theory seem downright pessimistic toward just about any new<br/>theory not already backed up by either several papers or a huge survey.</p><p>  Bottom line question...is the Tuning list supposed to be open to such<br/>surveying?  If it is not...I&apos;m strongly guessing someone like Margo should take<br/>over the list...if not...I think Mike B has done a great job with his group and<br/>would do a great job with this one (plus he has &apos;text-book&apos; micro-tonal<br/>knowledge that rivals Carl&apos;s).<br/>------------------------------<br/>     Plus, there&apos;s a huge difference between not enough moderation and someone<br/>who says virtually everything is wrong and gives either a single<br/>one-track-minded overtly biased alternative for progress or none at all.  It&apos;s<br/>like someone saying &quot;we need a real boss&quot; and then bringing in a sergeant who<br/>picks personal fights!  Just because someone takes huge measures does not make a<br/>good leader, being a good leader means empowering the team and working well with<br/>the team, not just oneself!</p><p>&gt;&quot;However, Carl is *not* the root cause of the problems here and changing<br/>&gt;moderator will not stop the people who wish to converse in insults and vulgar<br/>&gt;language.&quot;<br/>    You don&apos;t seem to understand.   Carl is one of such people...in fact I see<br/>him starting more fights by a factor of two or more than any other list member.<br/>And you know what?  If Carl name calls someone and he gets name called back (as<br/>often happens)...serves him right!  Now if Carl doesn&apos;t do anything to someone<br/>and gets called an idiot...of course that&apos;s not fair...but I haven&apos;t seen anyone<br/>do that.</p><p>&gt;&quot;If this was a perfect world we would all talk in a civil manner to each other -<br/>&gt;but unfortunately it is not a perfect world.&quot;<br/>   As has been tried...but I have yet to be able to bring up a thread, even<br/>within the past month, where Carl doesn&apos;t jump in and derail it...and have seen<br/>the same thing happen to so many people (Robert, Ozan, and Mike B just to name a<br/>few).  In fact, please others correct me if I&apos;m wrong, but so far as I have<br/>heard Chris V. is the only one here really defending Carl..</p><p>    Chris...you seem to assume people on this list are ego-centric lazy brats<br/>who do little work and then try to steal claims to greatness and call names<br/>along the way and need to be &quot;baby-sat&quot; by Carl because of their own<br/>immaturity.  Nothing can be further from the truth!...I&apos;ve found people on this<br/>list, &quot;even&quot; those I completely disagree with, to be incredibly hard-working and<br/>intelligent and very civil...until someone attacks them for something they never<br/>said or did.  If the problem really was people like Marcel and<br/>myself...certainly there would be many fights and lack of progress on the tuning<br/>research list...but there are no such things.  I&apos;m not saying the problem is all<br/>Carl...but I think it&apos;s fair to say he brings out the worst in many of us,<br/>rather than the best...and that&apos;s the opposite of what a leader should do.</p></div><h3>Michael &#x3C;djtrancendance@...&#x3E;</h3><span>10/30/2010 3:52:00 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Ozan&gt;&quot;2.

Or even run around starting<br/>fights with people about what he &quot;thinks&quot; their intentions are to prevent them<br/>from starting bad threads.  Which is pretty much what Carl does a whole lot of<br/>the time.<br/>   An alternative suggestion: let the defense be ignoring.

If the poster fails to do this, I believe he should be<br/>put under moderation in such a way that attempts to re-post that topic are<br/>blocked for at least a couple of weeks the first violation and, say, a month the<br/>second violation, 2 for the 3rd violation, etc.</p><p>     The idea would be to keep the ideas on the list interesting in the opinion<br/>of the group, rather than merely interesting in the mind of the moderator.

I can say<br/>I do not remember her ever flaming anyone.&quot;<br/>    IMVHO, the two kind of go together: a good moderator would never flame or<br/>&quot;even&quot; flame back.  At worst, I figure, he, after complaints from not just one<br/>but a few list members, would force someone to take discussions off-list and<br/>close a topic...and for sure he&apos;d give several private warnings directly to the<br/>&quot;violating&quot; person in question.</p><p>&gt;&quot;however you can&apos;t deny he knows a great deal about tuning, tuning mathematics,<br/>&gt;and perhaps most valuable, the history of this list.&quot;<br/>    I have also said several times, he knows a lot about tuning and tuning math<br/>and has been here a lot.  The problem comes when anyone (and not just me)<br/>introduces something not addressed in the list&apos;s history or in past tuning math<br/>theories.  Simply put, he makes a great historian/&quot;librarian&quot;, but not much of a<br/>futurist (regardless of how much he claims to be the latter).<br/>   I think it&apos;s fair to say with things Carl has gotten upset about, such as<br/>Ozan&apos;s new use of 11-limit and poly-tonality in Maqam music, Mike B&apos;s theories<br/>of minorness and more...the common thread is Carl&apos;s complaining none of it is<br/>rooted in ideas he knows well from past discussions.<br/>  With Carl the list has a strong continuity of and organized record of the<br/>past, but not much evolution...that&apos;s the best way I can summarize it.</p><p>&gt;&quot;You seem to be laying your perception of the demise of the entire tuning list<br/>&gt;at Carl&apos;s feet.&quot;<br/>&gt;&quot;At the same time you seem to be forgetting your argument with Michael S. Or my<br/>&gt;argument with Michael &gt;&quot;S. Or Igs&apos; argument with Michael S. Or all of the other<br/>&gt;circular Michael S.&quot;<br/>&gt;&quot;arguments I have (thankfully) forgotten.&quot;<br/>   Yep, &quot;forgotten&quot; indeed...because apparently you have not the slightest idea<br/>how to prove them because, guess what, outside of your subjectivity they did not<br/>actually happen!  What did actually happen: things like your calling the PHI and<br/>Silver scale theory a circular argument...and then using the PHI and Silver<br/>section scales and having them become the top 2 downloaded songs on your SOON<br/>music site!   Or things like the Infinity scale system and theories of tall<br/>chords which Cameron, Gene, and several others have noted excellent properties<br/>in.   And a ton of other examples, but I don&apos;t want to ramble on.</p><p>   So, in reality, so far as actual proven &quot;circular&quot; arguments...unless you can<br/>prove to me otherwise, you (Chris) have nothing so far on me!<br/>  But (Chris) I do have something on you (beside your being a terrible hypocrit<br/>in your use of my scales)...that you and your &quot;Or my argument with Michael &gt;&quot;S.<br/>Or Igs&apos; argument with Michael S. Or all of the other circular Michael S.&quot;<br/>statement...Carl is not the only one starting flame wars here...you are pretty<br/>much hurling gasoline into the fire (yep, really mature pointing the gun at me<br/>Chris...like that&apos;s ever going to fly)!</p></div><h3>jonszanto &#x3C;jszanto@...&#x3E;</h3><span>10/30/2010 8:30:57 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>With all due respect:</p><p>Regarding Carl...<br/>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, Michael &lt;djtrancendance@...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt; Simply put, he makes a great historian/&quot;librarian&quot;, but not much of a<br/>&gt; futurist (regardless of how much he claims to be the latter).</p><p>I&apos;ve been on this list since 96, and Carl has been on it either nearly as long or longer. There have been an *awful* lot of elements of tuning and intonational development that have gone on in those years, and while Carl and I do *certainly* not see eye to eye on a lot of stuff, I have to speak up and say that he has been a very active part in many of these developments.</p><p>Whether it was actively developing new elements of evolving theories, or being one of the people reviewing posts, music, and code to find flaws, I honestly believe he has a strong place in much of the work that has gone down on this list (and related lists).

Like any community, you need to hone your interpersonal skills as much as possible, and tread strongly but carefully. I&apos;m not even really offering an opinion on his efforts as moderator, because I&apos;m not here on a daily basis. But the idea that he rejects new ideas out-of-hand or is institutionally biased against &apos;futurist&apos; thinking is, frankly, bunk.</p><p>I&apos;d love to put this in even more colorful terms, but I&apos;m trying to be considerate to Ozan.</p><p>Regards,<br/>Jon</p></div><h3>Michael &#x3C;djtrancendance@...&#x3E;</h3><span>10/30/2010 10:12:06 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>First of all, let me admit my statement about &quot;Carl&apos;s futurism&quot; was vaguely<br/>put.  It&apos;s not that I think Carl is not a futurist or not productive as a single<br/>person, but that his net effect on the tuning community as a leader has been, at<br/>least for the time I&apos;ve been here, more about discouraging futurism among others<br/>than promoting it.</p><p>  His actions show an aire of thinking maybe three people on the list are<br/>&quot;worthy&quot; of expressing ideas to try and develop into new theories and the rest<br/>have some terrible work ethic, lack of intelligence, or malicious intent.  Which<br/>pushes the vast majority of the list community away from futurism.  And unless<br/>Carl can make more progress than every person he claims is &apos;practicing<br/>psuedoscience&quot; in their efforts at theories combined (IE he really is that much<br/>smarter than Mike B, Ozan, Robert, etc.)...his net community effect of promoting<br/>futurism is negative.<br/>==============================</p><p>&gt;&quot;But having started (and moderated for 6 or 7 years) MMM, I know first-hand what<br/>&gt;an odd assortment of cranks, egos, quiet types and raving loons the tuning<br/>&gt;community can - at any given moment - encompass.&quot;<br/>   Well I&apos;ll say this much.  The topic of &quot;I have THE answer to music&quot;, held in<br/>the past by Charles Lucy, John (IE the &quot;Mathematics of Music&quot; author), and<br/>Marcel...really does qualify to me as loony.  But, at least from what I&apos;ve seen,<br/>people who go that far are far and few inbetween and, under Carl&apos;s leadership,<br/>for every person who got censored and embarrassed...for truly bad behavior there<br/>are many more who got whipped equally badly who didn&apos;t really do anything<br/>wrong.  So I understand the situation with occasionally &quot;list loons&quot;...I just<br/>think Carl has gone too far and virtually started &quot;going Draconian&quot; on here. :-D<br/>======================================<br/>Jon&gt;&quot;To have someone relatively new come in, throw down a few new areas of their<br/>interest&quot;</p><p>    (If I&apos;m hearing you right on this one)...Why should this become an<br/>experience game even though I (and I&apos;m sure many other &quot;relatively new&quot; people<br/>including Ozan and Mike B) been here for years and most likely working on music<br/>and/or theory for hours a day?</p><p>&gt;&quot;and start to assume that somehow Carl Lumma has lost all interest in the<br/>&gt;evolution of tuning, acoustics, and related concepts beggars belief.&quot;</p><p>   Of course he has interest, but from what I&apos;ve seen only interest &quot;on his<br/>terms&quot; seems to count and most other interest expressed by other aspiring<br/>micro-tonalists is called (paraphrased) &quot;dumb and useless&quot;.  IMVHO that&apos;s not<br/>exactly the kind of attitude that makes other people want to work on developing<br/>new theories on here...   Mike B&apos;s tuning research list, as I recall, was<br/>actually made in response of Mike B and others having trouble trying to post<br/>honest and hard-worked attempts at theories without being harassed by flames<br/>from Carl (typically) and sometimes a couple of others.</p><p>&gt;&quot;Whether it was actively developing new elements of evolving theories, or being<br/>&gt;one of the people reviewing posts, music, and code to find flaws&quot;</p><p>    Well I haven&apos;t been here for so long as yourself...but I can easily agree<br/>Carl has done a lot of &quot;reviewing posts, music, and code to find flaws&quot;.<br/>      In fact, even regarding such recent examples as triadic harmonic entropy,<br/>he has evolved new theories.</p><p>      But (back to my point)...even then his new theories seem to &quot;have&quot; to link<br/>to his past theories.  For example, he has favored Harmonic Entropy for ages and<br/>relatively disregarded critical band dissonance and difference tones a million<br/>times over.  He&apos;s stood in the face of Mike B, Jacques Dudon, Sethares, myself,<br/>and countless others who have spent years working on several different theories<br/>and pretty much said &quot;you are chasing a straw man&quot;.<br/>    For every theory he has evolved, at least from what I&apos;ve seen, he has put<br/>down or even censored out several equally hard-worked attempts at alternative<br/>new theories.  He has gone so far as to call people foolish for trying anything<br/>different and at times even throw them off the list or censor their posts for<br/>it.  Hence my interpretation that his &quot;net result&quot; of being here has done more<br/>against the future than for it.</p><p>&gt;&quot;But the idea that he rejects new ideas out-of-hand or is institutionally biased<br/>&gt;against &apos;futurist&apos; thinking is, frankly, bunk.&quot;<br/>     Take that back, in a way.  I get the impression Carl may very well not be<br/>against futuristic thinking...as long as such futurist thinking follows his<br/>personal biases.<br/>  I&apos;ve found few instances where Carl can say stand back and say  &quot;I don&apos;t agree<br/>with this, but this seems to have purpose with other musicians&quot; to other<br/>people&apos;s new theories and moderate with the piece of mind to realize what&apos;s one<br/>man&apos;s trash in the art world can legitimately be not just &quot;another man&quot; but<br/>&quot;other men&apos;s &quot; treasure.  I have, however, heard him countless times (and for<br/>sure not just to me!) call just about any theories he doesn&apos;t agree with<br/>psuedoscience.  That includes Ozan&apos;s theories, Mike B&apos;s theories (despite that<br/>he said (paraphrased) &quot;Mike B has learned a lot and knows at least as much as I<br/>do&quot;), Marcel&apos;s theories, my theories, and much much more.</p><p>     So, don&apos;t get me wrong: I understand the moderation issues Carl deals with<br/>and am not saying it&apos;s some sort of hate that causes him to do what he does to<br/>&quot;guard the list&quot;.  But rather I&apos;m saying, regardless of why he does what he does<br/>OR how much positive research he does as a single person, the net effect of what<br/>the entire community (not just him!) is able to produce under his &quot;rule&quot; lately<br/>hasn&apos;t exactly been good.</p></div><h3>jonszanto &#x3C;jszanto@...&#x3E;</h3><span>10/30/2010 10:25:16 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, Michael &lt;djtrancendance@...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt; First of all...</p><p>Mike, have you ever considered working on a &quot;concise&quot; mode?

I am not sure whether Carl, Ozan, myself, or anyone else<br/>could singlehandedly guide this group -- even with the help of<br/>two other moderators -- although I hope that we can all be a<br/>part of such a cooperative endeavor.</p><p>To seek a relaxed and moderate ethos in which to write this<br/>article, I have tried playing a famous sharki by Dede Efendi in<br/>Maqam Beyate, and also playing taksim (if it deserves anything<br/>faintly approaching that name) in Maqam Nishaburek, whose<br/>nobility combines the virtues of Rast and Ushshaq.</p><p>First, I would not wish to displace you, Carl, or anyone in the<br/>process of doing my part to seek a more harmonious and congenial<br/>group. And so I will take your nomination, Ozan, as an invitation<br/>to promote reconciliation and cooperation, since these are what<br/>the group needs to thrive.</p><p>Secondly, you should all be well aware (if you are not already)<br/>that I have a serious fault of often expressing things in a more<br/>lengthy than concise way, with whatever consequences from the<br/>viewpoint of clarity or readability. Moderation seems to me a<br/>skill where cordiality and conciseness are both at a premium.</p><p>Third, you should also be aware that I love large integer ratios,<br/>as is shown my penchant to explain that I tuned dugah-hijaz in<br/>Maqam Nishaburek at a virtually just 59/48, among other things a<br/>mark of Jacques Dudon&apos;s influence.

The dry and almost algorithmic demonstration of the invalidity of the basic premises you advocate has been, for a couple of years now! a source of musical seeds for me: the few seconds it takes to demonstrate in musical practice the invalidity, or at best highly conditional validity, of, for example, harmonic entropy, has provided concrete sonic entities which explode in musical potentials and the beauty of truth.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; I must credit the methodical argument against the superb structure of your reasonings, based on your spectacular failure to grasp the ABC&apos;s of sound and the creation of music, with the some of the deepest musical advances I&apos;ve made in my life.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; Let&apos;s take an example:<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; --- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;Carl Lumma&quot;&lt;carl@&gt;  wrote:<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt; While all this is going on, I&apos;ve been trying to make<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt; productive posts.

First, the delighful dash of sneaky sophistry:<br/>&gt; &gt; &quot;experts&quot;. What experts? Only Dr. Yarman has any claim to be an expert in this case. His claim here, in mainstream terms, is rock solid- a doctorate in the field, in a &quot;maqam&quot; culture no less. Vastly more important to me is the fact that I have met and spent a several hours with Ozan in real life, and would have to place him easily in &quot;top ten f*cking intimidatingly good ears I&apos;ve ever met&quot;. I don&apos;t wish to embarass Ozan here, but I did not tell him at that time that in the &quot;headliner&quot; group which performed after mine in Istanbul were two musicians who know Ozan- speaking to them afterward, I found that they shared the same opinion of his superb abilities.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; So, we have someone with a legitimate mainstream claim to being a genuine expert, and interested parties probably highly skilled and perhaps &quot;expert&quot; in other perhaps closely related, or not particularly closely related, areas. But obviously no &quot;experts&quot;, plural, and not a soul- not even the one who could easily do so! saying such things as &quot;as an expert in maqam music, I...&quot; So why use such a patently false expression? Why, to create the delusion that those who speak on the topic are claiming to speak from inarguable authority. Sophistry of the slickest make- I&apos;m always absolutely delighted to see you in action, Carl! You ROCK! (doing Il Cornico)<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; To continue!<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; Margo has posted, numerous times, data from analyses of maqam recordings, specifically, measurments of divisions of tetrachords given in cents. Didn&apos;t you notice this? She posted it in posts addressed to you, and gave sources! Cris also has presented data, Ozan&apos;s papers are full of analyses. I spent hours measuring, checking, rechecking, the measurments of the fretting on the baglama I bought in Istanbul and posted data here. Yet I have not seen one word from you acknowledging even the existence of ANY of these figures!<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; Now, why would that be (laughing out loud)? Because looking at (and more importantly, listening to) the figures presented, it is obvious to any thoughtful and informed person that, while designation of the intervals in question  may not be best described by means of rationals, it is nevertheless entirely reasonable to do so, and reasons have been given.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; You asked for historical bearing plans for rational maqam tunings, yet when Cris spoke of a specific historic bearing plan, you said not a word! Meanwhile everyone with a genuine basic understanding and even a brief acquaintance with maqam was already laughing, for the<br/>&gt; &gt; undeniable presence of historical Pythagorean tuning schemes ARE bearing plans.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; Hmmmmmmmmmmm!!!! Now why would it necessary to resort to rhetorical dishonesty to argue against a position? Why claim &quot;not a peep&quot; from &quot;experts&quot; when there is noone claiming expert, and have been plenty of peeps? That&apos;s easy to answer. The &quot;peeps&quot; came with sensible explanations as to why those peeping choose to use rationals in their descriptions. When the tactic is to discredit anyone who disagrees with you as a delusional, it is imperative not to draw attention to the instances of clues reasonably presented.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; Tell me, Carl: should I not call the 7/6 fretted deliberately, clearly and with remarkable precision, on my baglama a 7/6? Why on G-d&apos;s earth would I NOT call it a 7/6? Because it&apos;s not 24-tET? Because 7/6 doesn&apos;t &quot;qualify&quot; according to the pretty &quot;harmonic entropy&quot; graph? Give me a good reason.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; If you are unable to give me a good reason, intellectual honesty demands that you back off your position of categorical dismal of using rationals in the description of maqam tunings. It&apos;s a braying-jackass position anyway, as you won&apos;t find a sane person on earth who would deny the  plethora of Pythagorean strucures in maqam tunings- and a moment&apos;s thought reveals these as rationaly constructed as well.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; I await with delight the witnessing of your weasling with aplomb out of answering me here, nevertheless ever hoping against hope for a straight answer.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; -Cameron Bobro<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt;</p></div><h3>Michael &#x3C;djtrancendance@...&#x3E;</h3><span>10/31/2010 7:40:34 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Cameron&gt;&quot;Tell me, Carl: should I not call the 7/6 fretted deliberately, clearly<br/>and with remarkable precision, on my baglama a 7/6?

Carl is very productive and encourages<br/>productivity, but ONLY to his pet theories and even go so far as to openly<br/>denounce experts in other theories as if .  Harmonic Entropy is one of such pet<br/>theories (perhaps his favorite beside Miller&apos;s 9-10 note limit for interpretable<br/>scales or that all &quot;good&quot;/consonant chords must fit the harmonic series in<br/>low-limit).  His ignorance of Ozan, Margo, and Cris&apos;s specific examples seem to<br/>directly agree me my observation that he&apos;s not ignoring these things because he<br/>can find real flaws, but because the &quot;major flaw&quot; he finds is they don&apos;t match<br/>any of his pet theories.</p><p>   Granted, music is an art so, to some degree, everyone has their &quot;pet<br/>theories&quot;.

And yet, I swear, he does the violating guilty action of<br/>claiming he has the only answer far more than any of the people he complains<br/>about.</p><p>  And goes to the point of actively discouraging virtually any innovation not<br/>related to his pet-theories (IE if someone said his pet-theory was an &quot;only<br/>correct answer&quot;).

Both rationals and cents values imply an accuracy that isn&apos;t there--they are at best landmarks.  I think the upshot of this entire debate is that insisting on any standard of measurement for an artform that has some amount of uncertainty built into its foundation is nonsense.  Insisting that the intervals performed have any one single unquestionable identity gets no one anywhere, because there is always going to be some valid question about their identity.  Many roads lead to the same goal, so far as the performers and audience are concerned, and convenience is typically the strongest priority.  So you and Carl are both right, and both wrong.

When I do maths research - often I get stuck with something and just can&apos;t get anywhere with ordinary logical thought. Same with programming too, something I want to program but just can&apos;t see a way to do it. Then quite often I&apos;ll see the solution as I wake up from sleep. Not sure if it is in the dream state itself, or it is the moment of awakening.

Because if you take<br/>(using my old generating formula of (PHI-1)^x + 1 exclusively...and no other<br/>tones):</p><p>0.618^1 + 1 = 1.618<br/>0.618^2 + 1 =    1.3819 (near the area right between 4/3 and 7/5)<br/>0.618^3 + 1 =    1.236 (not far from the mediant at (6+5)/(5+4) &lt;the mediant of<br/>6/5 and 5/4&gt; =  11/9)<br/>0.618^4 + 1 =    1.145 (about 8/7, not actually a mediant of any sort but not at<br/>the 7/6 low entropy point on the harmonic entropy)<br/>0.618^4 + 1 =    1.09 (about 12/11, again not actually a mediant of any sort but<br/>not at the 7/6 &apos;smallest ratio&apos; entropy point on the harmonic entropy)</p><p>    Some people saw a fair number of the fractions generated by ratios in my<br/>&quot;PHI sections&quot; scale</p><p>A) Were near mediants between Harmonic Entropy<br/>B) They recalled that, historically, PHI had often been used for the quest for<br/>maximum dissonance (even though I had been trying for maximum consonance by<br/>using PHI in a different manner).</p><p>  So they threw their hands up and told me I had simply &quot;discovered someone<br/>else&apos;s theory&quot;.   They said that the exact mediants were defined by a method<br/>called noble mediants IE <a href="http://dkeenan.com/Music/NobleMediant.txt">http://dkeenan.com/Music/NobleMediant.txt</a> that turn up<br/>numbers near Harmonic Entropy maxima.  But if you plug in the formula on that<br/>page to Harmonic Entropy minima you will get ratios at least 10 cents away from<br/>the values in my scale.</p><p>  And even if the values were the same (or in fact, are close enough in some<br/>people&apos;s minds to qualify as being the same), note that I generated them by<br/>sections and Margo Schulter and David Keenan (authors of the paper) generated<br/>them by mediants.</p><p>  Actually Margo, perhaps you could help explain the differences between my old<br/>scale and the values from your &quot;Noble Mediants&quot; study yourself...I figure it&apos;s<br/>clearest to get information from its original source.<br/>----------------------------<br/>    Now I step back years after I found the PHI-section scale.  First of all, I<br/>disagree that it&apos;s as good at producing consonance as I originally thought.  I<br/>originally thought, when rounded to JI values IE 8/7, 12/11, 16/13, 13/8,<br/>11/8...it would be competitive with things like 1/4 comma meantone for<br/>consonance but enable more chords.  Now it doesn&apos;t seem as such for consonance<br/>but the range of chords available with &quot;at least decent&quot; consonance still seems<br/>very broad to my ears.  Perhaps it&apos;s because the scale simply stays predictably<br/>in a range of &quot;decent consonance&quot; and doesn&apos;t ping-pong from &quot;great&quot;/low to<br/>&quot;piercing&quot;/high consonance (like so many microtonal scales do) that it seems<br/>more stable than it actually is (at least in JI format).</p><p>    And the success of Chris&apos;s compositions based on the PHI scale also really<br/>make me wonder...as does the fact it still seems a whole lot more stable<br/>sounding than virtually any other irrational-number-generated scale I&apos;ve found<br/>(at least, not including ones that aren&apos;t also within a few cents of meantone).<br/>I just figure (at worst)...numerically you&apos;d think it should sound a whole lot<br/>worse than it does...surely there&apos;s something to be learned in trying to figure<br/>out why...<br/>---------------------------------------</p><p>    But looking back, I still wonder if anyone can find any novel uses for or<br/>patterns in my old &quot;PHI sections&quot; theory and has found novel uses for, for<br/>example, Lucy Tuning or Marcel or John&apos;s tunings?<br/>To move ahead...I figure...we have to adopt a positive attitude to bring out the<br/>best in each other&apos;s ideas (even if the best that&apos;s useful is only a tiny part<br/>of the original theory) instead of methodically finding out ways to throw them<br/>away....</p></div><h3>Mike Battaglia &#x3C;battaglia01@...&#x3E;</h3><span>11/1/2010 2:09:23 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>On Mon, Nov 1, 2010 at 5:00 PM, Michael &lt;djtrancendance@...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &nbsp;&nbsp; Oddly, I don&apos;t recall even seeing him do such...could you give a specific quote of his, in its full/original context?&nbsp; I do remember him giving a chart for rating dyadic consonance by how many approximate 5ths in an octave-reduced chain it takes to reach an interval...but I don&apos;t remember him going up to anyone about their consonance theories and saying anything like &quot;this is obviously wrong&quot;, &quot;your idea is pseudoscience&quot;, &quot;do you not have any ability to simply follow idea and learn the real answer&quot; etc.</p><p>He says that JI is pseudoscience all the time.

This requires dividing<br/>the octave into 19 or 25 parts to make it break even to a power of two IE match<br/>the octave.</p><p>    If that&apos;s it, at least on the surface, I don&apos;t see any obvious unique<br/>properties...it sounds like a tweaked version of mean-tone and why PI is used is<br/>not really explained.   Perhaps he has a reasoning about how musical scales map<br/>around a circle (also generated by PI), but the connection is not clear to me at<br/>this point.<br/>    I also haven&apos;t heard Charles Lucy say JI is pseudoscience (as you, Mike B,<br/>claim he did), but I do think his implication that only Lucy Tuning can make<br/>both an Open E major and G major &quot;sing&quot; does seem a bit far fetched; I might say<br/>otherwise if he provided sound examples for that claim but he doesn&apos;t.  It<br/>almost sounds as if the benefits of Lucy Tuning are exclusively for designing<br/>acoustic instruments...otherwise why (in mean-tone or 12TET even) would those<br/>two chords have different intervals and not be any more than a transposition<br/>anyhow?<br/>    He, however, does say &quot;Although careful                       to point out<br/>this is just one of hundreds of variants proposed<br/>throughout the ages, Lucy admits: &quot;The difference is,                       this<br/>one seems to work.&quot; The Barbican guitar weekend                       is the<br/>acid test. &quot;. -<a href="http://www.lucytune.com/press_room/st_nov_87.html">http://www.lucytune.com/press_room/st_nov_87.html</a><br/>But again why it works or what advantage exactly it is designed to provide, is<br/>beyond me.</p><p>--------------------<br/>    Back to my own old PHI theory, my hunch was not that it would &quot;solve<br/>consonance&quot;, but rather it could achieve more chords under a not-much-worse-than<br/>diatonic scale system under 12TET.  The reason why I used PHI was that it had<br/>been proven architecturally to be able to divide lines into related sub-sections<br/>IE fitting the unique condition a + b / a = a/b...I thought &quot;if it registers as<br/>uniquely beautiful in architecture...why not also music?&quot;   So I began making a<br/>scale system that used PHI as the period and (PHI-1)^x + 1 as the generator<br/>within that period (described in further detail in my last post at the beginning<br/>of the thread).  In addition, I had heard that recurrent sequences had the<br/>unique property of forming equal difference tones that boost consonance a bit<br/>(as I understood it from Jacques Dudon), so I thought using PHI in a recurrent<br/>sequence would likely yield that advantage.</p><p>Anyhow, my overall point is not how right/wrong Charles or Myself are but<br/>A) Can anything musically useful (if little) be extracted from our individual<br/>ideas?<br/>B) Lucytuning is a type of meantone and my &quot;PHI section scale&quot; in some ways<br/>resembles Noble Mediants a lot....but why does coming up with &quot;the same or a<br/>similar answer via a different method&quot; necessarily make that new method no<br/>improvement or even less valid in people&apos;s minds than the original generating<br/>method?</p></div><h3>genewardsmith &#x3C;genewardsmith@...&#x3E;</h3><span>11/1/2010 3:26:34 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, Michael &lt;djtrancendance@...&gt; wrote:<br/>If he hadn&apos;t done that...think about it...why didn&apos;t<br/>&gt; Harrison&apos;s work become as popular as Charles Lucy&apos;s in the years inbetween when<br/>&gt; he and Lucy &quot;discovered&quot; his theory?</p><p>Because the Internet had not yet been invented.

I<br/>&gt;&gt; originally thought, when rounded to JI values IE 8/7, 12/11, 16/13, 13/8,<br/>&gt;&gt; 11/8...it would be competitive with things like 1/4 comma meantone for<br/>&gt;&gt; consonance but enable more chords.  Now it doesn&apos;t seem as such for consonance<br/>&gt;&gt; but the range of chords available with &quot;at least decent&quot; consonance still seems<br/>&gt;&gt; very broad to my ears.  Perhaps it&apos;s because the scale simply stays predictably<br/>&gt;&gt; in a range of &quot;decent consonance&quot; and doesn&apos;t ping-pong from &quot;great&quot;/low to<br/>&gt;&gt; &quot;piercing&quot;/high consonance (like so many microtonal scales do) that it seems<br/>&gt;&gt; more stable than it actually is (at least in JI format).<br/>&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt;      And the success of Chris&apos;s compositions based on the PHI scale also really<br/>&gt;&gt; make me wonder...as does the fact it still seems a whole lot more stable<br/>&gt;&gt; sounding than virtually any other irrational-number-generated scale I&apos;ve found<br/>&gt;&gt; (at least, not including ones that aren&apos;t also within a few cents of meantone).<br/>&gt;&gt; I just figure (at worst)...numerically you&apos;d think it should sound a whole lot<br/>&gt;&gt; worse than it does...surely there&apos;s something to be learned in trying to figure<br/>&gt;&gt; out why...<br/>&gt;&gt; ---------------------------------------<br/>&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt;      But looking back, I still wonder if anyone can find any novel uses for or<br/>&gt;&gt; patterns in my old &quot;PHI sections&quot; theory and has found novel uses for, for<br/>&gt;&gt; example, Lucy Tuning or Marcel or John&apos;s tunings?<br/>&gt;&gt; To move ahead...I figure...we have to adopt a positive attitude to bring out the<br/>&gt;&gt; best in each other&apos;s ideas (even if the best that&apos;s useful is only a tiny part<br/>&gt;&gt; of the original theory) instead of methodically finding out ways to throw them<br/>&gt;&gt; away....<br/>&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; ------------------------------------<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; You can configure your subscription by sending an empty email to one<br/>&gt; of these addresses (from the address at which you receive the list):<br/>&gt;    <a href="mailto:tuning-subscribe@yahoogroups.com">tuning-subscribe@yahoogroups.com</a> - join the tuning group.<br/>&gt;    <a href="mailto:tuning-unsubscribe@yahoogroups.com">tuning-unsubscribe@yahoogroups.com</a> - leave the group.<br/>&gt;    <a href="mailto:tuning-nomail@yahoogroups.com">tuning-nomail@yahoogroups.com</a> - turn off mail from the group.<br/>&gt;    <a href="mailto:tuning-digest@yahoogroups.com">tuning-digest@yahoogroups.com</a> - set group to send daily digests.<br/>&gt;    <a href="mailto:tuning-normal@yahoogroups.com">tuning-normal@yahoogroups.com</a> - set group to send individual emails.<br/>&gt;    <a href="mailto:tuning-help@yahoogroups.com">tuning-help@yahoogroups.com</a> - receive general help information.<br/>&gt; Yahoo!

This requires dividing<br/>&gt; the octave into 19 or 25 parts to make it break even to a power of two IE match<br/>&gt; the octave.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;     If that&apos;s it, at least on the surface, I don&apos;t see any obvious unique<br/>&gt; properties...it sounds like a tweaked version of mean-tone and why PI is used is<br/>&gt; not really explained.   Perhaps he has a reasoning about how musical scales map<br/>&gt; around a circle (also generated by PI), but the connection is not clear to me at<br/>&gt; this point.<br/>&gt;     I also haven&apos;t heard Charles Lucy say JI is pseudoscience (as you, Mike B,<br/>&gt; claim he did), but I do think his implication that only Lucy Tuning can make<br/>&gt; both an Open E major and G major &quot;sing&quot; does seem a bit far fetched; I might say<br/>&gt; otherwise if he provided sound examples for that claim but he doesn&apos;t.  It<br/>&gt; almost sounds as if the benefits of Lucy Tuning are exclusively for designing<br/>&gt; acoustic instruments...otherwise why (in mean-tone or 12TET even) would those<br/>&gt; two chords have different intervals and not be any more than a transposition<br/>&gt; anyhow?<br/>&gt;     He, however, does say &quot;Although careful                       to point out<br/>&gt; this is just one of hundreds of variants proposed<br/>&gt; throughout the ages, Lucy admits: &quot;The difference is,                       this<br/>&gt; one seems to work.&quot; The Barbican guitar weekend                       is the<br/>&gt; acid test. &quot;. -<a href="http://www.lucytune.com/press_room/st_nov_87.html">http://www.lucytune.com/press_room/st_nov_87.html</a><br/>&gt; But again why it works or what advantage exactly it is designed to provide, is<br/>&gt; beyond me.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; --------------------<br/>&gt;     Back to my own old PHI theory, my hunch was not that it would &quot;solve<br/>&gt; consonance&quot;, but rather it could achieve more chords under a not-much-worse-than<br/>&gt; diatonic scale system under 12TET.  The reason why I used PHI was that it had<br/>&gt; been proven architecturally to be able to divide lines into related sub-sections<br/>&gt; IE fitting the unique condition a + b / a = a/b...I thought &quot;if it registers as<br/>&gt; uniquely beautiful in architecture...why not also music?&quot;   So I began making a<br/>&gt; scale system that used PHI as the period and (PHI-1)^x + 1 as the generator<br/>&gt; within that period (described in further detail in my last post at the beginning<br/>&gt; of the thread).  In addition, I had heard that recurrent sequences had the<br/>&gt; unique property of forming equal difference tones that boost consonance a bit<br/>&gt; (as I understood it from Jacques Dudon), so I thought using PHI in a recurrent<br/>&gt; sequence would likely yield that advantage.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Anyhow, my overall point is not how right/wrong Charles or Myself are but<br/>&gt; A) Can anything musically useful (if little) be extracted from our individual<br/>&gt; ideas?<br/>&gt; B) Lucytuning is a type of meantone and my &quot;PHI section scale&quot; in some ways<br/>&gt; resembles Noble Mediants a lot....but why does coming up with &quot;the same or a<br/>&gt; similar answer via a different method&quot; necessarily make that new method no<br/>&gt; improvement or even less valid in people&apos;s minds than the original generating<br/>&gt; method?<br/>&gt;</p></div><h3>Brofessor &#x3C;kraiggrady@...&#x3E;</h3><span>11/1/2010 5:50:09 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>I agree with Michael here.<br/> There really is no way to prove it anyways.

And I don&apos;t know the specific ethnic group or region the guys were from- for all I know the fret placement I got is only done by the older generation in one Kurdish village or something.</p><p>It&apos;s not impossible that the fret placement I got is extremely rare- and I subconciously &quot;caught&quot; it as having intervals I like when I heard the guy playing it. Goodness knows I had to run away from enough high-pressure salesmen shredding on the instruments trying to sell them to me, LOL.</p><p>It&apos;s well known that you can get all kinds of fret placements when you buy a baglama. I saw some that were fretted in 24-tET, and some that seemed to have frets placed in a way I could only describe as &quot;randomly&quot;. Doesn&apos;t matter- the point of moveable frets is to move them where you&apos;d like. The finest shop I visited- where I&apos;m heading directly next time- was a &quot;pro shop&quot;, and almost all the instruments had no frets tied on at all. Many were not even completely finished instruments, waiting to be customized.</p><p>But why am I even telling you this, Carl? You&apos;ve already preemptively dismissed the whole thing.  Still if you&apos;re ever around here you&apos;re welcome to measure the thing yourself, and I will try to take a picture (I have &quot;almost never&quot; taken a photo in my life, strangely enough, but gotta start sometime I guess).</p><p>-Cameron Bobro</p><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;Carl Lumma&quot; &lt;carl@...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Hi Cameron,<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; Carl, you said it &quot;isn&apos;t reasonable at all&quot; to use rationals<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I thought we were finally threatening to make progress in<br/>&gt; this thread:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; <a href="http://groups.yahoo.com/group/tuning/message/93991">http://groups.yahoo.com/group/tuning/message/93991</a><br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; and was hoping you&apos;d reply.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; -Carl<br/>&gt;</p></div><h3>hstraub64 &#x3C;straub@...&#x3E;</h3><span>11/2/2010 5:05:02 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Alright - now I have to add my 2 percents, too...</p><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, Michael &lt;djtrancendance@...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Robert<br/>&gt; &gt; &quot;But if you stop after the other person has had their last<br/>&gt; &gt; word - that&apos;s often a good point to stop, let them have their<br/>&gt; &gt; say.

And it will sure not &quot;fade away&quot;, no matter what Marcel says or hopes.<br/>As for me, I will probably start ignoring both you and Carl (and Marcel, too).</p><p>I will leave you the last word.<br/>--<br/>Hans Straub</p></div><h3>cameron &#x3C;misterbobro@...&#x3E;</h3><span>11/3/2010 2:03:15 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p><a href="http://www.activemusician.com/item--MD.SAZR">http://www.activemusician.com/item--MD.SAZR</a></p><p>This might as well be a picture of mine. It was not tuned as usual, A-D-G, but as the next larger version, bozuk d&uuml;zen, usually is, fifths from G. As typical, it has 15 frets to the octave.</p><p>The pricing of these things is tragically low, it almost makes me cry to think of the underpaid workers involved, from forest through manufacture to retail outlet.</p><p>The frets without exception were marked and placed precisely (leading edge of filament wound to mark) only on millimeter marks within the 556 millimeter scale. These instruments are nominally &quot;260 mm&quot; models, but this one was set to 556mm, verifiable by the (perfectly tuned, as far as I can tell) fourth and octave fret marks and placements.</p><p>The strings are very thin, very low and parallel to the fretboard, so string displacement issues in the lower region are effectively nil. Of course there&apos;s a +/- on any stringed instrument.</p><p> 556/527<br/> 556/511<br/> 556/495<br/> 556/476<br/> 556/449<br/> 556/417</p><p>Here are the millimeter measurements of the fret placements within first 4/3. I checked them once again. Given that the frets were all tied to millimeter marks and the purity of the 4/3 and 2/1, I highly doubt that these are sloppy renditions of nearby targets. Nevertheless I measured some reasonable speculative possibilities such as from the back and middle rather than the leading edge of the nut and even the unlikely (given the marked pure octave) possibility that the frets were marked within a 260mm scale. I would consider it reasonable to speculate that the markings could be &quot;meant&quot; to be a millimeter less (higher pitch) up to two millimeters more (lower pitch).</p><p>So if you want to view these as, say, +/- 2 cents, I think that is fair.</p><p>Remember that we&apos;re talking about measured markings. String displacements issues are unusually low on this instrument, but of course the sounding intervals will vary some. Nevertheless, it&apos;s the targeted intervals we&apos;re looking at. A friend of mine with powerful hands always concretely sharps a 12-tET guitar, and there are many intonational issues in fretting, but we could still determine that his guitars are deliberately fretted to 12-tET.</p><p>-Cameron Bobro</p></div><h3>Michael &#x3C;djtrancendance@...&#x3E;</h3><span>11/3/2010 8:27:45 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Hans&gt;&quot;Now, now. Let&apos;s not get too pathetic. Of course you deserve to be here -<br/>but you ARE here, right?&quot;<br/>    To be more specific, let me use the old Rosa Parks example.  She wasn&apos;t just<br/>saying I&apos;m here as in &quot;physically around&quot;, she insisted on being in the front of<br/>the bus as in a place of decent (though by no means over-inflated) respect.  If<br/>you are somewhere but not allowed to be heard and respected, you&apos;re often as<br/>good as &quot;not there&quot;: that&apos;s my point.  Also, I surely don&apos;t feel &quot;absurd&quot; using<br/>the MLK example...there&apos;s a huge difference between passive resistance and just<br/>walking away or &quot;even&quot; physically being somewhere but not allowing yourself<br/>communicative bandwidth to actually get a fair chance to get anything done.</p><p>&gt;&quot;You can post, you can discuss everything on-topic you like&quot;<br/>   Don&apos;t get me wrong, it has gotten better...but it still happens.  One<br/>example: I posted a simple, honest post about the list double standard of &quot;we&apos;re<br/>not taking your point seriously because you have only managed to get a small (IE<br/>4-5 people) double-blind survey to back it up with&quot; and, on the other hand &quot;I<br/>refuse to help you get people to participate in such a survey or give credit for<br/>your surveying efforts&quot;.  Not only was the post blocked from public but I was<br/>called a troll several times (by a troll, obviously) in public afterward.<br/>Another: my first introduction of the PHI section scale and the whole Noble<br/>Mediant mix-up where a troll forced others to believe a definition of the scale<br/>I never made...it got so bad people would publish his (wrong) version of the<br/>scale, his (wrong) assumption of properties that go with it, and call it mine!</p><p>&gt;&quot;And it will sure not &quot;fade away&quot;, no matter what Marcel says or hopes.&quot;<br/>   Marcel hasn&apos;t said anything like that for ages...if at all.  Like I said<br/>before, why do people start fights like that?!</p><p>&gt;&quot;But - well, alright. I get it you will not stop trollfeeding.&quot;<br/>    So saying things like &quot;I will not leave until someone attempts to get my<br/>theory correctly instead of repeatedly misconstruing it to death to the public&quot;<br/>or re-posting if a get a moderator note back that &quot;your post was refused because<br/>it show &apos;circular logic&apos; (without explaining why)&quot; counts as &quot;feeding the<br/>trolls&quot; and that if I stop doing that I&apos;ll be left in a &quot;decent/fair&quot; position<br/>to voice myself on this list fairly?</p><p>    I can understand IF this &quot;trolling&quot; issue were about, say, accepting that<br/>someone does not like your theory: it would be solved in my case.  I&apos;ve had<br/>people say my difference tone ideas and other theories were useless and said<br/>&apos;fine, let them be and do that&apos; because they did not distort what I said but<br/>simply said they didn&apos;t like it (which is OK).</p><p>   But then they&apos;d do things like say my simply communicating my ideas has the<br/>implication of my having ego issues, of being a troll, and end up<br/>misinterpreting my theories, re-posting them incorrectly, and in general<br/>confusing other people.  That&apos;s where I draw the line and say &quot;it doesn&apos;t help<br/>anyone for me to just stand here and take this&quot;.  Meanwhile, I don&apos;t<br/>particularly find useful Carl&apos;s favored theory of Tenney Height, but I surely<br/>don&apos;t go around distorting that theory&apos;s meaning or saying &quot;it&apos;s wrong so Carl&apos;s<br/>must be a psuedoscientist&quot; or anything like that...yet when I have said I don&apos;t<br/>like Carl&apos;s theories in the past his usual response is &quot;that&apos;s because you don&apos;t<br/>understand it&quot; (IE I explained periodicity in terms of both cycles and periods<br/>and got the answer checked and confirmed by a Doctorate Geophysicist...and Carl<br/>still refused to give me fair credit for learning it and said &apos;he knows NOTHING<br/>about periodicity&apos; about me on the list afterward).  This is not a simple issue.</p><p>&gt;&quot; And from the history in this list, it is quite clear that Carl won&apos;t stop,<br/>&gt;either.&quot;<br/>    In most cases, I&apos;ve found Carl being the troll rather than feeding the<br/>troll.  If he doesn&apos;t think a theory matches with his areas of expertise...he&apos;ll<br/>quite often go a step further than saying &quot;it&apos;s wrong&quot; and actually blame said<br/>person for ruining the list by posting &quot;psuedo-science&quot; to it and even telling<br/>others on the list &quot;you should never listen to this person...he&apos;s an idiot&quot;.<br/>That&apos;s beyond childish harrassment, that&apos;s all out direct defamation.</p><p>    Another example, Mike B created his tuning-research list, as I understand<br/>it, mostly to create an environment where people could speak their minds without<br/>fear of that happening.</p><p>   I figure, let&apos;s at least get the facts straight on what types of &quot;trolling&quot;<br/>we are dealing with...it&apos;s not the type you can just ignore and watch it go<br/>away.</p></div><h3>Carl Lumma &#x3C;carl@...&#x3E;</h3><span>11/3/2010 11:54:20 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Cameron wrote:</p><p>&gt; <a href="http://www.activemusician.com/item--MD.SAZR">http://www.activemusician.com/item--MD.SAZR</a><br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; This might as well be a picture of mine.</p><p>I can&apos;t see any fret markings on that.

I asked myself this immediately upon seeing the marks. This is easily answered: the frets were tied with admirable consistency to the middle of the marks. That is, each mark was halfway (of course there are fraction of millimeter variances) covered by the marks. This still doesn&apos;t rule out the possibility that the frets weren&apos;t placed by ear, moved at some point, then moved back. :-) BUT, this also is extremely unlikely, because it is plain to see that the frets were tied on before the finish was 100% dry!</p><p>If you were to inspect the instrument closely, I&apos;m sure you&apos;d agree that the frets were marked and tied on at the point of manufacture, or very soon thereafter, and not moved.</p><p>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;  556/527 ! 93<br/>&gt; &gt;  556/511 ! 146<br/>&gt; &gt;  556/495 ! 201, 9/8<br/>&gt; &gt;  556/476 ! 269, 7/6<br/>&gt; &gt;  556/449 ! 370<br/>&gt; &gt;  556/417 ! 498, 4/3<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; Here are the millimeter measurements of the fret placements<br/>&gt; &gt; within first 4/3.

Obviously I don&apos;t buy the &quot;JI nuts&quot; comment, as I find the tendency to 7:6 downright irksome in its strength, preventing me from practically using intervals a little lower, intervals which I find delightful to listen to but difficult to perform by ear because of that dang 7:6 in the way.</p><p>But let&apos;s take a look at what &quot;those who have come before...&quot; might actually entail. Take a look at tetrachord #459 in John Chalmer&apos;s Divisions of the tetrachord, for example. The intervals are ordered for Rast (I presume) on the baglama, but they&apos;re indistinguishable from those of an Ibn Sin tetrachord. There is more such going on on this baglama, you can figure it out if you&apos;d like.</p><p>At this point in time we will probably never solve the chicken or egg? questions in this matter, but I&apos;d those guys of olden days were doing a fine job of documenting and instructing, NOT playing number games.</p><p>-Cameron Bobro</p></div>
