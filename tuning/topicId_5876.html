Much thanks.</p><p>OK - I&apos;ll try, but it&apos;s really difficult because it&apos;s quite<br/>technical stuff.  Sorry, but I&apos;ve been working in tuning<br/>theory for 16 years, and this is so old-hat for me that<br/>don&apos;t always &apos;start at the beginning&apos;.  In addition, until<br/>I got on the Mahler List in June, just about everyone I<br/>corresponded with via email was another tuning theorist,<br/>so they know all this stuff too.  Here goes, very briefly<br/>(but still quite long):</p><p>NO SUCH THING AS &apos;ATONAL&apos;:<br/>--------------------------</p><p>I believe, as did Schoenberg, that &apos;atonal&apos; music, in the<br/>literal meaning of the term, is an oxymoron, an impossibility,<br/>because...</p><p>FREQUENCY<br/>---------</p><p>A sound which does not produce a specific pitch, for example,<br/>a cymbal crash or beating on a snare-drum, is one that does<br/>not vibrate air molecules at a specific frequency, but rather,<br/>vibrates the molecules in motions that are more-or-less<br/>random.  This is referred to technically as &apos;white noise&apos;.</p><p>On the other hand, a sound which produces a specific pitch is<br/>one that vibrates air molecules at a *specific* frequency, as<br/>in our famous tuning-fork standard, A-440.  This simply means<br/>that the note which we ordinarily call &apos;A&apos; (above &apos;middle-C&apos;)<br/>vibrates air molecules back and forth at the rate of 440 cycles<br/>per second.  A cycle is simply the waveform of that particular<br/>sound, which never varies (or varies so slightly that we<br/>don&apos;t perceive a change in pitch) during the course of the<br/>sound.</p><p>Therefore, in any group of different pitches (i.e., any<br/>chord or melody), each pitch will bear a specific relation<br/>to all the others, and it is expressible mathematically.<br/>There are often several different ways of describing these<br/>mathematical relationships - primarily dependant on the<br/>type of tuning system used on the instruments, altho modern<br/>research has found that the mathematical relationships<br/>*implied* or *perceived* by individual listeners is a far<br/>more complex matter than has previously been thought -<br/>but the important point is that the numerical relationships<br/>*always* exist, as long as the sound source is periodic.</p><p>This is precisely why Schoenberg and I cannot condone the<br/>use of &apos;atonal&apos; to describe music that does not follow<br/>the &apos;rules&apos; of traditional tonality.  Schoenberg preferred<br/>&apos;pantonal&apos; to describe his post-1907 compositions;  I like<br/>&apos;extended tonality&apos;.</p><p>RATIOS:<br/>-------</p><p>Any quantities that can be compared by some type of integer<br/>proportion are said to be &apos;rational&apos;, expressible by a<br/>*ratio*.  NOTE THAT RATIOS MAY BE DESCRIBED AND MANIPULATED<br/>MATHEMATICALLY AS FRACTIONS.</p><p>This is one of the fundamental aspects of tuning theory.<br/>Any interval (i.e., any two specific pitches) where the<br/>pitches are in an integer relationship to each other, can<br/>be described as a ratio.  The two most well-known rational<br/>types of tuning system are &apos;Pythagorean&apos; and &apos;Just-Intonation&apos;.</p><p>The fundamental ratio is that of the &apos;unison&apos; interval,<br/>which is 1:1.</p><p>The next simplest ratio is that of the &apos;octave&apos;, 2:1.</p><p>These are the only unambiguous ratios in tuning theory<br/>(altho even the 2:1 for the &apos;octave&apos; is suspect:  modern<br/>research has found that most listeners find the &apos;most<br/>consonant octave&apos; to be slightly larger than 2:1).</p><p>The &apos;perfect 5th&apos; in rational tuning theories is 3:2.<br/>The &apos;perfect 4th&apos;, its inverse or &apos;complement&apos;, is 4:3.</p><p>Now I must leave rational tuning theory and digress to<br/>describe the scale in common use today...</p><p>12-EQ:<br/>------</p><p>This is my abbreviation for the standard 12-tone equal-tempered<br/>scale, which is the one normally tuned on pianos and fretted on<br/>guitars. (but these days, not always... microtonality is<br/>becoming more and more popular... but on your standard<br/>store-bought instruments, this is what you get.)</p><p>Another popular abbreviation is 12tET.</p><p>In the 12-eq scale, the &apos;octave&apos; is always tuned precisely<br/>to a 2:1 ratio, and each &apos;step&apos; in the 12-tone scale is tuned<br/>to the 12th root of each progressive power of 2.</p><p>In other words, using the &apos;chromatic&apos; scale starting on &apos;C&apos;<br/>as an example, we get the following mathematical relationships.<br/>The scale is presented here from the top down. &apos;^&apos; means &apos;raised<br/>to the power of&apos;, and is the ASCII equivalent of superscript<br/>exponents.  Raising any number to a fractional power is the<br/>same as drawing a &apos;root&apos; sign with the denominator as the root,<br/>for example, &apos;2^(1/2)&apos; is the same as &apos;the 2nd root of 2^1&apos;,<br/>which is the same as &apos;the square root of 2&apos;.  Also note that<br/>any number to the &apos;0th&apos; power equals 1.  (Use a fixed-width<br/>font such as &apos;Courier&apos; to make everything line up properly.)</p><p>C      2^(12/12) = 2^1 = 2<br/>B      2^(11/12)<br/>Bb/A#  2^(10/12) = 2^(5/6)<br/>A      2^(9/12)  = 2^(3/4)<br/>Ab/G#  2^(8/12)  = 2^(2/3) = &apos;cube root of 2 squared&apos;<br/>G      2^(7/12)<br/>Gb/F#  2^(6/12)  = 2^(1/2) = &apos;square root of 2&apos;<br/>F      2^(5/12)<br/>E      2^(4/12)  = 2^(1/3) = &apos;cube root of 2&apos;<br/>Eb/D#  2^(3/12)  = 2^(1/4) = &apos;4th root of 2&apos;<br/>D      2^(2/12)  = 2^(1/6)<br/>Db/C#  2^(1/12)<br/>C      2^(0/12)  = 2^0 = 1</p><p>The simplifications to the right are not really important<br/>in tuning theory - I just put them there to help you understand.<br/>You should note, however, that the &apos;tritone&apos; is the<br/>square root of 2, which means that it *equally* divides<br/>the pitch-space of the &apos;octave&apos;.  Also note that the<br/>ratio of the &apos;octave&apos;, 2^(12/12):2^(0/12), is reducible<br/>to 2:1, as described in the previous section.</p><p>It is very important to tuning theory that *none* of the<br/>other intervals in this scale are expressible as ratios.<br/>Except for the &apos;octave&apos; and its multiples, all other<br/>intervals can be described as ratios only by using infinite<br/>non-repeating decimals.  THE 12-EQ SCALE CANNOT BE DESCRIBED<br/>AS FRACTIONS.</p><p>As far as the original subject of this correspondence, note<br/>that THE ONLY PRIME NUMBER INVOLVED IN THE RATIOS OF<br/>THE 12-EQ SCALE IS &apos;2&apos;, THE FIRST PRIME.</p><p>Historical note: the mathematics to describe the 12-eq scale<br/>were not developed until the 1600s (at almost the same time<br/>in China and Europe - China was first), so even if the concept<br/>was &apos;in the air&apos; prior to that, this scale could not be<br/>accurately tuned until then.  In fact, real precision was<br/>not possible until the advent of modern digital electronics.<br/>Rational systems, on the other hand, have been quite<br/>accurately tuned by ear since ancient times.</p><p>SONANCE<br/>-------</p><p>I believe, as did both Schoenberg and Harry Partch, that<br/>consonance and dissonance are not diametrically opposed<br/>aspects of sound, but are rather the opposite endpoints of<br/>a continuum.</p><p>Schoenberg continued to use the two terms in the way most<br/>theorists use them, which has caused much confusion in the<br/>literature about Schoenberg&apos;s theories by now.</p><p>Partch improved on this a bit by always saying &apos;relative<br/>consonance or dissonance&apos; instead of using either term<br/>separately.</p><p>I simply use the term &apos;sonance&apos; to describe the whole<br/>continuum, with the understanding that absolute consonance<br/>means the 1:1 (unison) ratio, absolute dissonance is an<br/>undefinable ratio which is too complex to comprehend<br/>(perhaps it is &apos;white noise&apos;), and the sonance of all<br/>other musical ratios falls somewhere in between.</p><p>CENTS<br/>-----</p><p>In his 1875 English translation of Helmholtz&apos;s _On the<br/>Sensations of Tone_, Alexander Ellis described a small<br/>interval called a &apos;cent&apos;, which was made equivalent to<br/>1/100th of a 12-eq &apos;semitone&apos;.  This measurement has become<br/>almost indispensable in the modern tuning literature.</p><p>The mathematical description of it is: 2^(1/1200).  Thus,<br/>a &apos;semitone&apos; equals 100 cents, and an &apos;octave&apos; equals 1200<br/>cents.</p><p>The cent is very useful for comparing the sizes of intervals<br/>which may be derived from a variety of different mathematical<br/>procedures.  It&apos;s a kind of &apos;yardstick&apos;.</p><p>PYTHAGOREAN TUNING<br/>------------------</p><p>Pythagorean tuning (named after the ancient Greek philosopher)<br/>is based on a series of &apos;perfect 5ths&apos; or &apos;perfect 4ths&apos;.<br/>This is because the 12th pitch in the series is very close<br/>to the original starting pitch, about 23 cents (or approximately<br/>1/4 of a semitone, or 1/8-tone) higher or lower (depending<br/>on whether the series was generated by &apos;4ths&apos; or &apos;5ths&apos;).<br/>This small discrepancy is now known as the &apos;Pythagorean<br/>Comma&apos;.</p><p>Because of this near-unison, many theorists both ancient<br/>and modern felt that a 12-tone scale could provide all the<br/>pitches necessary for musical use, with the appropriate<br/>&apos;fudging&apos; of the 23-cent difference.  This is, historically,<br/>why we still use a 12-tone scale today.</p><p>Also, both our musical notation and the concept of a &apos;circle<br/>of 5ths&apos; are ultimately derived from the Pythagorean tuning<br/>system.</p><p>The important point concerning prime-numbers is that<br/>PYTHAGOREAN TUNING USES ONLY THE PRIMES 2 AND 3 IN ITS RATIOS.<br/>Thus, it is known as a &apos;3-limit&apos; system.</p><p>JUST-INTONATION<br/>---------------</p><p>There are conflicting differences in the various definitions<br/>of &apos;just-intonation&apos;, but primarily, it refers to the fact<br/>that there are ratios which involve &apos;5&apos; as a factor which<br/>are rather close in pitch to their Pythagorean &apos;cousins&apos;<br/>but which make for much more consonant harmonies.  These<br/>are mainly the intervals of &apos;3rds&apos; and &apos;6ths&apos;, both major<br/>and minor.</p><p>As an example:</p><p>The &apos;major 3rd&apos; in the Pythagorean scale is derived from<br/>a succession of 4 &apos;perfect 5ths&apos; upward or &apos;perfect 4ths&apos;<br/>downward:</p><p>(3:2)^4 = 81:16 = E<br/>(3:2)^3 = 27:8 = A<br/>(3:2)^2 = 9:4 = D<br/>(3:2)^1 = 3:2 = G<br/>(3:2)^0 = 1:1 = C</p><p>This 81:16 ratio actually describes the very large interval<br/>of a &apos;major 17th&apos; (i.e., 2 &apos;octaves&apos; plus a &apos;major 3rd&apos;).<br/>If we reduce the interval by eliminating the &apos;octaves&apos;<br/>(i.e., the powers of 2), so that it really is a &apos;major 3rd&apos;,<br/>its ratio becomes 81:64.  Its interval size can also be<br/>described as approximately 408 cents.</p><p>What this means acoustically is that the waveforms of the<br/>two pitches will coincide at every 64th cycle of the lower<br/>pitch and every 81st cycle of the higher pitch.  As these<br/>numbers are too high for the brain to comprehend their<br/>relationship during listening, this is not a very consonant<br/>sound.</p><p>The ratio 5:4, on the other hand, is obviously much more<br/>consonant, since the waveforms coincide at every 5th cycle<br/>of the higher pitch and every 4th cycle of the lower pitch.<br/>This interval can also be described as approximately<br/>386 cents.  It is known as the &apos;just major 3rd&apos;, &apos;just&apos;<br/>being here a synonym for &apos;correct&apos;.</p><p>The difference between the just and Pythagorean &apos;major 3rds&apos;<br/>is approximately 22 cents.  This discrepancy is known as<br/>the &apos;Syntonic Comma&apos;, or if just plain old &apos;comma&apos; is used,<br/>this is what is meant.</p><p>What I described here about the &apos;major 3rd&apos; applies also to<br/>the &apos;minor 3rd&apos; as well as the &apos;major 6th&apos; and &apos;minor 6th&apos;.</p><p>Note that the size of the Syntonic Comma is almost the<br/>same as that of the Pythagorean Comma, which means that<br/>if both systems are extended far enough, to include a large<br/>enough number of pitches, they are almost synonymous.<br/>This idea has been the basis of many different kinds of<br/>&apos;tempered&apos; scales other than the usual 12-eq one.</p><p>HIGHER-PRIME FACTORS<br/>--------------------</p><p>This is where the disagreement come in about what is<br/>definable as &apos;just-intonation&apos;.</p><p>Many tuning theorists and composers use &apos;just-intonation&apos;<br/>to refer to *any* tuning system which uses only rational<br/>pitch intervals, including those with prime-factors higher<br/>than 5 (i.e, higher &apos;prime-limit&apos; systems), while others<br/>limit &apos;just-intonation&apos; to meaning only that system using<br/>factors of 2, 3, and 5, that is, a &apos;5-limit&apos; system.</p><p>At any rate, there was much disagreement from 1482 (when<br/>Ramos first described a &apos;5-limit&apos; tuning system) up until<br/>about Schoenberg&apos;s time, whether or not ratios involving<br/>7 are implied in musical compositions, or indeed whether<br/>ratios involving 7 can be considered musical at all.<br/>(Schenker was a notable opponent of recognizing primes<br/>higher than 5.)</p><p>Modern music, especially that derived from the blues, has<br/>answered this question decisively in the affirmative.</p><p>Partly because of the influence of Schoenberg&apos;s theories<br/>and compositions, and partly just because of the exhaustive<br/>exploration that has taken place in the 20th century of the<br/>intervallic and harmonic possibilities inherent in the 12-eq<br/>scale, much music exists which implies (to a greater or lesser<br/>degree) ratios which have prime-factors even higher than 7,<br/>such as 11, 13, 17, and 19.</p><p>Most theorists are reluctant to admit that primes higher<br/>than 19 are implied in actual music, and many won&apos;t even<br/>go that far (since some prime-factors, particularly those<br/>of 11 and 13, produce intervals quite far in pitch from<br/>the familiar ones in the 12-eq, Pythagorean, and 5-limit<br/>tunings), but some composers working in just-intonation<br/>specifically use intervals which have higher prime-factors.<br/>La Monte Young has probably gone further in this than any other composer,<br/>using primes as high as 283 in his latest piece.</p><p>There are also *lots* of other types of tuning systems<br/>besides equal-tempered and just-intonation, notably<br/>&apos;meantone&apos; and &apos;well-temperament&apos;; but there are even<br/>others that are more complicated (&apos;Lucytuning&apos;, Bohlen-<br/>Pierce tuning, etc.).

And<br/>surprisingly enough, he _did_ want harmonies pulled from the harmonic<br/>series! Unfortunately, he was not careful enough with his math to realize<br/>that 12-equal could not consistenly represent harmonies involving ratios of<br/>11 and 13 -- in fact, Schoenberg equated two notes which, if actual harmonic<br/>series were used, would be about 99 cents apart!</p><p>I totally agree, though, that for a totally rootless, totally dissonant form<br/>of atonality, as opposed to the way Schoenberg though of it, 11-equal would<br/>be far more effective than 12-equal.</p></div><h3>Paul H.
