This<br/>time, the waveform isn&apos;t just a &quot;harmonic timbre,&quot; but an actual chord<br/>- it&apos;s 1:2:3:4:5:6:7:... with sines, all played at equal volume. I am,<br/>as you all know, of the hypothesis that the &quot;buzzing&quot; heard in this<br/>waveform/chord is an advanced, evolved version of the periodicity buzz<br/>heard in 5:6:7. Carl is skeptical, which is a zero-entropy statement.<br/>:) But before I can satisfy Carl&apos;s request to hear my experiment<br/>repeated with smaller chords (like 5:6:7), I have to go through this<br/>stage anyway, for signal processing reasons, so it&apos;s useful to post<br/>the results here.</p><p>This will, in the future, be useful because of magic signal processing<br/>stuff that will make this easy to evaluate for random chords. There<br/>are six waveforms this time:</p><p>1) A periodic perfect impulse train<br/>2) A periodic linear chirp (not symmetric)<br/>3) A periodic logarithmic chirp (not symmetric)<br/>4) Three random phase versions - periodic noise</p><p>Here&apos;s the graph of how everything looks:</p><p><a href="http://www.mikebattagliamusic.com/music/sflattestgraph.png">http://www.mikebattagliamusic.com/music/sflattestgraph.png</a></p><p>This time, since it was a pain in the ass for all involved to make so<br/>many separate wave files, I combined all of the examples for each<br/>frequency into one wave file. You get 1 second of the impulse train,<br/>then one second of the chirp, then one second of the other chirp, etc.<br/>Here you go:</p><p><a href="http://www.mikebattagliamusic.com/music/441sflattestwaves.wav">http://www.mikebattagliamusic.com/music/441sflattestwaves.wav</a><br/><a href="http://www.mikebattagliamusic.com/music/220.5sflattestwaves.wav">http://www.mikebattagliamusic.com/music/220.5sflattestwaves.wav</a><br/><a href="http://www.mikebattagliamusic.com/music/110.25sflattestwaves.wav">http://www.mikebattagliamusic.com/music/110.25sflattestwaves.wav</a><br/><a href="http://www.mikebattagliamusic.com/music/55.125sflattestwaves.wav">http://www.mikebattagliamusic.com/music/55.125sflattestwaves.wav</a><br/><a href="http://www.mikebattagliamusic.com/music/27.5625sflattestwaves.wav">http://www.mikebattagliamusic.com/music/27.5625sflattestwaves.wav</a></p><p>Note how there is almost no audible difference between the impulse<br/>train and the chirps at 441 Hz, but by the time you get down to<br/>27.5625 there&apos;s a HUGE difference.</p><p>Anyway, if you understood my explanation of the &quot;impulse train buzz&quot; =<br/>&quot;periodicity buzz&quot; phenomenon, you&apos;ll find this interesting. If not,<br/>then hold tight for the next wave of examples, which will be applied<br/>to chords.</p><p>-Mike</p></div><h3><a id=95560 href="#95560">ðŸ”—</a>Mike Battaglia &#x3C;battaglia01@...&#x3E;</h3><span>1/12/2011 12:38:12 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>On Wed, Jan 12, 2011 at 3:03 AM, Mike Battaglia &lt;battaglia01@...&gt; wrote:</p><p>One quick correction - I made an error in rendering these that causes<br/>each one to only have harmonics up to 50. For the 441 Hz example, this<br/>is okay, because 50 harmonics brings you to 441 * 50 = 22050, which is<br/>the highest frequency that CD quality audio can represent anyway. So<br/>each one of these is a</p><p>1:2:3:4:5:6:...:45:46:47:48:49:50</p><p>chord. This is pretty interesting, because I think the effect is<br/>actually more striking than with the version in which the harmonics go<br/>all the way up the range of hearing.</p><p>I want to bring special attention to this one:</p><p>&gt; <a href="http://www.mikebattagliamusic.com/music/55.125sflattestwaves.wav">http://www.mikebattagliamusic.com/music/55.125sflattestwaves.wav</a></p><p>I find the results are most apparent here. Listen to the impulse train<br/>one, and you&apos;ll hear the rapid-fire &quot;clicking&quot; on top that I believe<br/>is related to periodicity buzz. When the chirp rolls around, it&apos;s<br/>pretty clear that there&apos;s something different going on. But when you<br/>get to the noise, you hear this for what it is - it&apos;s somehow noise,<br/>but somehow in such a way that triggers the VF mechanism.</p><p>Keep in mind that this chord is 1:2:3:4:5:6:...:45:46:47:48:49:50,<br/>with all sines, and the only thing different between any of these<br/>examples is the starting phase of each sine. Phase can make quite a<br/>difference!</p><p>For those who are interested in hearing the &quot;full human range of<br/>hearing&quot; version, in which all harmonics are present for every<br/>waveform right up until we can&apos;t hear them anymore, here you go:</p><p><a href="http://www.mikebattagliamusic.com/music/441sflattestwavesfull.wav">http://www.mikebattagliamusic.com/music/441sflattestwavesfull.wav</a><br/><a href="http://www.mikebattagliamusic.com/music/220.5sflattestwavesfull.wav">http://www.mikebattagliamusic.com/music/220.5sflattestwavesfull.wav</a><br/><a href="http://www.mikebattagliamusic.com/music/110.25sflattestwavesfull.wav">http://www.mikebattagliamusic.com/music/110.25sflattestwavesfull.wav</a><br/><a href="http://www.mikebattagliamusic.com/music/55.125sflattestwavesfull.wav">http://www.mikebattagliamusic.com/music/55.125sflattestwavesfull.wav</a><br/><a href="http://www.mikebattagliamusic.com/music/27.5625sflattestwavesfull.wav">http://www.mikebattagliamusic.com/music/27.5625sflattestwavesfull.wav</a></p><p>-Mike</p></div>
