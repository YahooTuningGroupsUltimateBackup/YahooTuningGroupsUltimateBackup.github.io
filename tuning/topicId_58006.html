Verses 27-38 of Section 3 of<br/>chapter I of Sangita-ratnakara (a treatise from the 13th century), written<br/>by Sharngadeva, deal with the shruti-s, their classes, and their<br/>distribution among swara-s (notes). According to this, there are five<br/>classes of shruti-s: (1) dipta [pronounced deeptaa], meaning blazing,<br/>brilliant; (2) ayata [pronounced aayataa], meaning spread over, extended;<br/>(3) karuna [pronounced karuNaa], meaning compassion, pathos; (4) mrudu,<br/>meaning tender; and (5) madhyaa, meaning moderate, medium.</p><p>The combination of these classes found in each note:<br/>Sa: all except #3; Re: all except #1 &amp; #2; Ga: only #1 &amp; #2 present; Ma: all<br/>except #3; Pa: all except #1; Dha: all except #1 &amp; #4; Ni: only #1 &amp; #5<br/>present.</p><p>The significance of this classification has not been studied as far as we<br/>know, and so least understood.<br/>________________________________________________________________________</p><p>Based on your experience, what is your interpretation of &quot;the significance<br/>of this classification&quot;?</p><p>For example, could you confidently assign different inflections of Re, such<br/>as Re ati komal or Re tivra, to one or the other of these classes?  Or<br/>perhaps I have misunderstood how to apply the classification ...</p><p>Regards,<br/>Yahya</p><p>--<br/>No virus found in this outgoing message.<br/>Checked by AVG Anti-Virus.<br/>Version: 7.0.308 / Virus Database: 266.9.13 - Release Date: 16/4/05</p></div>
