I&apos;m<br/>pretty comfortable with the process of tempering a scale by using an<br/>appropriate val -- usually the patent val, but it doesn&apos;t have to be.</p><p>(Notation note: To prevent confusion between an EDO number and a prime, I&apos;m<br/>going to write, e.g., prime 19 as 19/1 in some cases where it wouldn&apos;t<br/>normally be needed.)</p><p>A couple of questions came out of that discussion.</p><p>1. Do some EDOs map some primes better than others? (We were talking about<br/>19/1 in 31 EDO, so I&apos;ll use that as my example.)</p><p>2. How can I find out which EDOs are better than others for a given prime?</p><p>I think the answer to #1 is &quot;Yes, BUT that&apos;s only relevant in the context of<br/>a given val and a given scale.&quot; Here&apos;s why.</p><p>-----</p><p>Using a val means using a particular substitute for a prime. The 19-limit<br/>patent val for 31 EDO is &lt; 31 49 72 87 107 115 127 132 |. That means it<br/>takes 132 steps of 31 EDO to reach 19/1, which is 5097.51 cents.</p><p>That&apos;s not true, of course. Each step of 31 EDO is 38.70967742 cents, 132<br/>steps of which is 5109.677 cents. But we&apos;re pretending that the 132-step<br/>figure  is right. That means we&apos;re substituting 2^(5109.677/1200), or<br/>19.13397238, in place of 19/1.</p><p>Because you&apos;re substituting a too-big number for 19/1, any interval with<br/>19/1 on top will be a little bit sharp (e.g., 19/16 is 309.7 cents instead<br/>of the just 297.5 cents). Any interval with 19/1 on bottom will be a little<br/>bit flat. (Of course, the errors from other primes may add to or cancel out<br/>some of the sharpness or flatness that comes from 19/1.)</p><p>If the 19.13397238 is too big for you, you can change the tuning by changing<br/>the val. Take the patent val:<br/>&lt; 31 49 72 87 107 115 127 132 |<br/>...and subtract 1 from the 19/1 place...<br/>&lt; 31 49 72 87 107 115 127 131 |<br/>...and now you&apos;re saying that 131 steps = 19/1, which means you&apos;re<br/>substituting 18.71089225 in place of 19/1. That&apos;s pretty flat, but maybe<br/>it&apos;s what you want.</p><p>Good so far?</p><p>Okay. Given all of that, it seems to me that a large error in 19/1 will make<br/>some EDOs worse than others. The 12-EDO patent-val value for 19/1 is<br/>19.02731384, which is considerably better than the 31-EDO patent-val value.<br/>Furthermore, there&apos;s a limit to how much you can adjust 31 EDO, because the<br/>farther up you go from 132 or the farther down you go from 131 steps, the<br/>more you&apos;re distorting 19/1.</p><p>Thus 12 seems like a better EDO than 31 for 19/1, generally speaking.</p><p>By the same logic (glossing over the calculations), 31 is a better EDO than<br/>12 for 5/1, generally speaking (5.0023 vs. 5.0397).</p><p>However, I glossed over something very important: &quot;The errors from other<br/>primes may add to or cancel out some of the sharpness or flatness that comes<br/>from 19/1.&quot; So even an EDO that&apos;s &quot;not very good&quot; for a particular prime can<br/>give good results as long as the errors cancel in the particular intervals<br/>you want.</p><p>A great example of that is 9/7 in 11 EDO using the val &lt; 11 17 26 30 |. (The<br/>patent val would have 31 in the 7/1 place.)</p><p>3/1 is 2.918960211, so 9/1 is 8.520328716. Yuck. And 7/1 is 6.622026239. But<br/>they&apos;re both so flat that when you divide one by the other, the error<br/>cancels out, and you get an almost-perfect 9/7. Similarly, it has a really<br/>good 29/24 because 29 and 3 have about the same (large) error.</p><p>Going back to 19/1 in 31 EDO: 19/18 has a high error (116 or 77 cents<br/>depending on the val, when the just value is 94 cents), but 19/17 maps<br/>really well with the patent val (within a cent of just). So saying &quot;31 EDO<br/>isn&apos;t great for 19&quot; depends on whether 19/17 or 19/18 -- or both -- is in<br/>your scale.</p><p>The lesson for me is that I shouldn&apos;t really care about whether &quot;n EDO is<br/>good in the p-limit&quot; except in the context of a particular just scale that<br/>I&apos;m mapping to it. When I&apos;m looking for a starting point, it doesn&apos;t hurt to<br/>get relatively low errors for the primes I&apos;m interested to start off with;<br/>but nothing matters until I map the specific intervals in my scale.</p><p>That strikes me as odd, since I seem to hear &quot;n EDO is good in the p-limit&quot;<br/>relatively often.</p><p>-----</p><p>So how do I find out which EDOs and vals map to given primes with relatively<br/>little error?</p><p>My first approach would be to go to Graham&apos;s temperament finder. (This might<br/>just be a question for Graham.)</p><p>Going here:<br/><a href="http://x31eq.com/temper/pregular.html">http://x31eq.com/temper/pregular.html</a><br/>...and plugging in 19 for the limit gives me EDOs 27eg, 31, 26, 29g, 19egh,<br/>12f, 9p, 15g, 14cf, 24p.</p><p>But I&apos;ve already shown that 31 has a worse value of 19/1 than 12 does.<br/>Moreover, Graham doesn&apos;t measure &quot;error&quot;, he measures &quot;badness&quot;, which I&apos;m<br/>struggling to understand. As a result, I don&apos;t really think this is what I&apos;m<br/>looking for.</p><p>I&apos;m inclined to think that I should put all of the primes of all of my<br/>intervals into the &quot;limit&quot; field, and that would give me a good idea of what<br/>EDOs would work; however, the Temperament Finder can&apos;t know which primes I&apos;m<br/>coupling together in my individual intervals, so it can&apos;t tell me what the<br/>error would be for my particular scale.</p><p>So I guess I&apos;m not sure how to determine which EDOs you should use for any<br/>given prime or set of primes. Right now I&apos;m looking at what commas I want to<br/>temper, finding an EDO of sufficient size to reduce the error to an<br/>undetectable level, and loading the file into Scala.</p><p>It certainly works, and maybe it&apos;s all I need. If so, I&apos;m happy to keep on<br/>keeping on. :)</p><p>Thanks in advance for any commentary,<br/>Jake</p></div><h3><a id=101237 href="#101237">ðŸ”—</a>Mike Battaglia &#x3C;battaglia01@...&#x3E;</h3><span>8/14/2011 10:21:58 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>On Mon, Aug 15, 2011 at 12:45 AM, Jake Freivald &lt;jdfreivald@...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Using a val means using a particular substitute for a prime.

Given all of that, it seems to me that a large error in 19/1 will make some EDOs worse than others. The 12-EDO patent-val value for 19/1 is 19.02731384, which is considerably better than the 31-EDO patent-val value. Furthermore, there&apos;s a limit to how much you can adjust 31 EDO, because the farther up you go from 132 or the farther down you go from 131 steps, the more you&apos;re distorting 19/1.</p><p>You can also stretch or compress the octave slightly. TOP and TOP-RMS<br/>(now called TE-Optimal I believe on Graham&apos;s temperament finder) are<br/>ways to spread the error evenly out over all primes, even if it means<br/>stretching the octave.</p><p>&gt; Thus 12 seems like a better EDO than 31 for 19/1, generally speaking.</p><p>Yep.</p><p>&gt; By the same logic (glossing over the calculations), 31 is a better EDO than 12 for 5/1, generally speaking (5.0023 vs. 5.0397).</p><p>Right.</p><p>&gt; However, I glossed over something very important: &quot;The errors from other primes may add to or cancel out some of the sharpness or flatness that comes from 19/1.&quot; So even an EDO that&apos;s &quot;not very good&quot; for a particular prime can give good results as long as the errors cancel in the particular intervals you want.</p><p>Sure, and also you find that flatter 3/1&apos;s and 5/1&apos;s make a flatter<br/>7/1 sound better than a sharper one, which leads to situations where<br/>the &quot;best val&quot; is not the same as the &quot;patent val.&quot; This can be<br/>formalized by saying that it&apos;s often the case that the patent val<br/>isn&apos;t the one with the lowest TE error (or TOP error, etc). The val<br/>with the lowest error usually also corresponds to which one sounds the<br/>best, and it also usually corresponds to the above (though not always,<br/>such as in 22-equal, where you have a slightly flat 5/4 and a slightly<br/>sharp 3/2).</p><p>For example, the best val for 23-equal is not the patent val - the<br/>best val is &quot;23d,&quot; and the patent val is &quot;23p&quot;:</p><p><a href="http://x31eq.com/cgi-bin/rt.cgi?ets=23&limit=7">http://x31eq.com/cgi-bin/rt.cgi?ets=23&limit=7</a></p><p>The one on top is best. So in this case, the val that gives the lowest<br/>error in some sense over &quot;all&quot; intervals in the 7-limit isn&apos;t the one<br/>in which you use the best direct approximation to 7/4. (Assuming the<br/>theory works, which to my ears it does.)</p><p>&gt; Going back to 19/1 in 31 EDO: 19/18 has a high error (116 or 77 cents depending on the val, when the just value is 94 cents), but 19/17 maps really well with the patent val (within a cent of just). So saying &quot;31 EDO isn&apos;t great for 19&quot; depends on whether 19/17 or 19/18 -- or both -- is in your scale.</p><p>I haven&apos;t worked this out but if you&apos;re saying that one val gives you<br/>a better 19/18 and the other gives you a better 19/17, then this is<br/>saying that 31-EDO is -inconsistent- in the 19-limit. Paul Erlich<br/>really hates this. I tend to be more of the &quot;just pick a val and close<br/>your eyes and think no more&quot; type, although in practice with this<br/>22-equal guitar sometimes I adjust my mapping for 13 on the fly.</p><p>&gt; The lesson for me is that I shouldn&apos;t really care about whether &quot;n EDO is good in the p-limit&quot; except in the context of a particular just scale that I&apos;m mapping to it.</p><p>I guess there are two main realizations to make here:<br/>1) When people say &quot;n-EDO&quot; at all, you have to realize that the phrase<br/>&quot;n-EDO&quot; is code for some val &lt;n a b c d e ...|. For example, &lt;19 30<br/>44| (the patent val for 19-equal) is great in the 5-limit, but &lt;19 31<br/>45| isn&apos;t so great. Whether or not you&apos;re talking about the patent val<br/>is usually left open - actually when I talk about 17-equal I&apos;m usually<br/>talking about the 17c val - or maybe it&apos;s assumed that you&apos;re willing<br/>to switch the mapping around on the fly like I do with 22-equal in the<br/>13-limit. But an EDO isn&apos;t good in any limit at all until you put a<br/>val on it.</p><p>2) Let&apos;s say that you&apos;re in the 5-limit and you want to add 19. So now<br/>you&apos;d be in the 2.3.5.19-limit, or the <a href="http://2.3.5.19">2.3.5.19</a> subgroup, or the<br/><a href="http://2.3.5.19">2.3.5.19</a> subgroup of the 19-limit, depending on how pedantic you want<br/>to be. If you know that you only want to use some interval in the<br/>19-limit, like 19/17, then you&apos;d be in the <a href="http://2.3.5.19/17">2.3.5.19/17</a> subgroup. A val<br/>might do a lot better for the <a href="http://2.3.5.19/17">2.3.5.19/17</a> subgroup than it does in the<br/>full <a href="http://2.3.5.19">2.3.5.19</a> subgroup. For example, 11-equal is great in the<br/>2.5/3.7.9.11 subgroup; not so great in the full 11-limit.</p><p>&gt; Going here:<br/>&gt; <a href="http://x31eq.com/temper/pregular.html">http://x31eq.com/temper/pregular.html</a><br/>&gt; ...and plugging in 19 for the limit gives me EDOs 27eg, 31, 26, 29g, 19egh, 12f, 9p, 15g, 14cf, 24p.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; But I&apos;ve already shown that 31 has a worse value of 19/1 than 12 does. Moreover, Graham doesn&apos;t measure &quot;error&quot;, he measures &quot;badness&quot;, which I&apos;m struggling to understand. As a result, I don&apos;t really think this is what I&apos;m looking for.</p><p>That&apos;s because the primes are weighted; 19 is assumed to be less<br/>important than something like 3 is.

[snip]</p><p>There&apos;s nothing inherently wrong with what you&apos;re doing here, but you&apos;re not<br/>applying a regular temperament.</p><p>&gt; The thing/problem with using EDOs (at least ones which aren&apos;t very<br/>&gt; high, such as 31EDO) is that you often don&apos;t have the option of only<br/>&gt; moving by 7 cents...you end up moving by something over 20 cents...</p><p>Right. Lower EDOs have higher errors, which isn&apos;t surprising given their<br/>step sizes.</p><p>The issue we&apos;re discussing is more easily noticed in higher EDOs, because<br/>there the step sizes are small, and the error sizes can approach or go<br/>beyond the step sizes.</p><p>It&apos;s okay that you like using 31 EDO, but sentences like this confuse me:</p><p>&gt; (it even turns out the octave inverse of 13/9 can map to 7/5, making<br/>&gt; 13/9 &quot;map&quot; to 10/7...</p><p>How does one JI interval &quot;map&quot; to another JI interval?

For instance, I can<br/>tell you that this val tempers out 225/224, 385/384, and 364/363, which<br/>makes it a Marvel temperament called &quot;Deecee&quot;. It also tempers out 65/64 and<br/>91/90.</p><p>If you use this val to map all of the intervals consistently across your<br/>entire scale, I can guarantee you those relationships, just like I can<br/>guarantee you that 5 fifths = an octave reduced Major Third in 12-tET.</p><p>Or you can round. Your call.</p><p>&gt; Meaning to say that 19 has a large error of how it&apos;s approximated in<br/>&gt; 31EDO and 18 (which has a limit of 3)  resolves around the error for<br/>&gt; 3-limit in 31EDO, which is small.  So a distorted numerator over a not<br/>&gt; similarly distorted denominator means a fraction with high error, correct?</p><p>Yes, correct.</p><p>&gt; And it turns out, even if you use the &quot;closer&quot; approximation for 19/18 in<br/>&gt; 31TET...it&apos;s still about 20 cents off and quite a lousy approximation.</p><p>True.

This is the sort of thing that has<br/>been explored more in the compositional community than on this list, where<br/>folks will intuitively treat a temperament as having both a normal fifth and<br/>a &quot;pelog fifth&quot; or something, but there&apos;s no reason you can&apos;t do it.</p><p>-Mike</p></div><h3><a id=101258 href="#101258">ðŸ”—</a>Jake Freivald &#x3C;jdfreivald@...&#x3E;</h3><span>8/15/2011 2:02:56 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>&gt; The first would be the 25p patent val, the other would be 25b.<br/>&gt; There&apos;s no reason you can&apos;t have both, and treat it as a 2.3.3b.5<br/>&gt; temperament.<br/>I don&apos;t understand.

I thought this went out<br/>last night. I&apos;ve slightly re-written it anyway, which might be a good thing.<br/>Michael said:<br/>&gt; if I have it right, what I did was the equivalent of using something<br/>&gt; equivalent to the patent val MINUS one change...I moved the number<br/>&gt; of steps to represent 19/1 down by one.</p><p>Yes.</p><p>&gt; The counter question is how does arbitrary rounding differ from the<br/>&gt; effect of changing a val...  That is, unless I came across a special<br/>&gt; case where I changed the 19-limit val and it only effects one ratio<br/>&gt; because there&apos;s only one 19-limit ratio in the whole scale I made<br/>&gt; (and it would have knocked things off miserably if there was, say, a<br/>&gt; 19/16 and more along with the 19/18).  In which case there would be<br/>&gt; an (often gross) inconsistency with the amount of error in 19/18 vs<br/>&gt; the other 19-limit ratios, thus making it &quot;irregular&quot;...correct?</p><p>Bingo.</p><p>&gt; the problem you have is ultimately my using the prime 19 mapped in more<br/>&gt; than one way within a single scale...</p><p>Yes.</p><p>&gt; For the record, what makes a patent val different than a non-patent val,<br/>&gt; since now it seems obvious both types of vals are consistently mapped<br/>&gt; (that one obeys musical interval addition rules IE 11/9 + 11/9<br/>&gt; (logarithmically added) = 3/2...and one doesn&apos;t)?</p><p>Someone else can give you a more technical definition, but I&apos;ll give you how<br/>I&apos;ve been calculating it in my spreadsheet, using 31 EDO as an example. I&apos;ll<br/>overexplain, as usual, to make sure we&apos;re on the same sheet of music, not<br/>because I want to insult your intelligence.</p><p>The val contains the number of steps it takes to get to a given prime<br/>number, in prime number order:<br/>&lt; [2/1] [3/1] [5/1] [7/1] [etc.] |</p><p>By definition, for any EDO, the number of steps to 2/1 is the EDO division:<br/>31 for 31 EDO. The 2-limit patent val is &lt; 31 |.</p><p>What&apos;t the number of steps to 3/1? The step size for 31 EDO is 38.70967742<br/>cents. 3/1 is 1901.96 in cents.</p><p>1901.96 cents / 38.70967742 cents/step = 49.13383752 steps.</p><p>This is an EDO, though -- I can&apos;t take .13383752 steps. So I round. This is<br/>clearly closer to 49 steps, so that&apos;s the &quot;obvious&quot; or &quot;patent&quot; choice.</p><p>The 3-limit patent val is &lt; 31 49 |.</p><p>Do the same thing up through 17, and you get an 17-limit patent val of<br/>&lt; 31 49 72 87 107 115 127 |.</p><p>How about 19? Same math: 19/1 = 5097.51 cents, 5097.51 / 38.70967742<br/>cents/step = 131.6857529 steps. Round to get 132. The 19-limit patent val is<br/>&lt; 31 49 72 87 107 115 127 132 |.</p><p>If I understand it correctly, the patent val will always have the least<br/>error on a per-prime basis for a given EDO. That doesn&apos;t always make it the<br/>best for mapping particular intervals to it, as the subgroup discussion that<br/>Mike B. presented shows. Plus, your ear may tell you that you really want<br/>some interval to be a little sharp, even though that has greater error than<br/>if you went flat.</p><p>So much for the patent val. What about vals that aren&apos;t the patent val?</p><p>Any 19-limit val other than this one is still a valid val, it&apos;s just not the<br/>&quot;patent&quot; val. Remember that &quot;patent&quot; here means something like &quot;obvious&quot; --<br/>just because a choice is obvious doesn&apos;t mean it&apos;s best. So there&apos;s an<br/>unlimited number of vals you could use here, each one with its own<br/>approximation for each prime in it. And as long as you&apos;re using the same<br/>approximations for the primes in all of the intervals of a given scale, you<br/>have a regular temperament.<br/>If you use a non-patent val, then some of the relationships that you found<br/>with the patent val no longer hold; however, new relationships take their<br/>place. So, for instance -- and this is a random example -- if you use the<br/>patent val in 31 EDO, you temper out 105/104, while if you use &lt; 31 49 72 87<br/>107 114 | --  where the value for 13/1 is one less than in the patent val --<br/>we don&apos;t temper 105/104, but we do temper 91/90, which the patent val<br/>didn&apos;t.</p><p>Some relationships remain the same, of course. 81/80 is a 5-limit comma, so<br/>changing the 13/1 place doesn&apos;t affect it. 81/80 is tempered out using<br/>either val in 31 EDO.</p><p>&gt; So (if I have it right), my supposed scale&apos;s 13/9 may slip into a 10/7<br/>&gt; in one case (IE the case when I rounded), but my scale may have a 13/10<br/>&gt; that&apos;s almost perfect (virtually no error)...so there would be no easy<br/>&gt; way to tell how accurate any 13-limit chords, for example, would be.</p><p>I still don&apos;t know what you mean by &quot;13/9 may slip into a 10/7&quot;.</p><p>Are you saying the 13/9 approximation sounds like a 10/7 to you? Because<br/>that&apos;s probably true, since 16 steps of 31 EDO is just 2 cents away from a<br/>pure 10/7.</p><p>Are you saying you&apos;re using the 13/9 approximation as you would a 10/7? That<br/>makes sense, too, for the same reason, but then why call it a 13/9?</p><p>You&apos;re not dealing with literal JI ratios, you&apos;re dealing with EDO steps. It<br/>seems to me that the most you could say is that &quot;The closest thing I have to<br/>a 13/9 is the same thing I use for a 10/7.&quot;</p><p>There *is* a way to tell how good any given 13-limit chords would be, as it<br/>turns out: Go to Graham&apos;s temperament finder and type in the subgroup for<br/>the chord(s) you want, and it&apos;ll tell you which EDOs and vals provide which<br/>badness measures.</p><p>&gt; IE, using a mapping including a step for 7/1, everything 7-limit, be it<br/>&gt; 8/7, 7/6,7/5...will always have the same error, which would be the error<br/>&gt; of the prime 7/1 from the EDO&apos;s nearest value for 7/1.</p><p>Yes.</p><p>&gt; &gt; If you use this val to map all of the intervals consistently across<br/>&gt; &gt; your entire scale...<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Right, so everything with an odd-limit of 13 gets mapped with the same<br/>error?</p><p>Prime limit, not odd-limit. Vals have nothing to do with odd-limit.</p><p>&gt; This goes back to our (unfinished) off-list discussion about finding out<br/>&gt; what the valuable commas are in a scale (vs. non-valuable commas) to<br/>&gt; match those commas to EDOs that suit them well.</p><p>Yes. I felt I had to answer the prime-mapping-to-EDO question before we went<br/>back to that, and I didn&apos;t know the answer.</p><p>For me, the most interesting (and challenging) aspect of learning what<br/>little I have in the past year has been understanding why tempering out a<br/>particular comma helps, or what character it adds to a temperament. I get<br/>meantone -- flatten the fifths, sweeten the thirds -- but for most other<br/>things I look on a scale-by-scale basis. When I use 11/9, I&apos;m probably going<br/>to want to temper 363/362 so that 2 neutral thirds = a perfect fifth.<br/>Eventually I think I&apos;d need to survey some temperament families to see how,<br/>say, Marvel differs from Kleismic differs from Porcupine, in terms of the<br/>intervals that might arise in their scales.</p><p>Regards.<br/>Jake</p></div><h3><a id=101266 href="#101266">ðŸ”—</a>Graham Breed &#x3C;gbreed@...&#x3E;</h3><span>8/16/2011 11:12:29 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Jake Freivald &lt;jdfreivald@...&gt; wrote:</p><p>&gt; There *is* a way to tell how good any given 13-limit<br/>&gt; chords would be, as it turns out: Go to Graham&apos;s<br/>&gt; temperament finder and type in the subgroup for the<br/>&gt; chord(s) you want, and it&apos;ll tell you which EDOs and vals<br/>&gt; provide which badness measures.</p><p>There is?
