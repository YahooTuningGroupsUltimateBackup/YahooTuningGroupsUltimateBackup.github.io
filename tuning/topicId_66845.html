Firstly, David Rothenberg was a good friend earlier in my life.  His wife, Suhasani, is a fantastic Tamil dancer.  David wrote a duo for me called &quot;Inharmonic Configurations&quot; for bassoon and synthesizer using a set out of 31-tET.  We performed it and made an archive recording.  David also wrote a piece for trumpet and bassoon.  David Rothenberg was on the AFMM Board of Directors for a number of years, and we had board meetings at his home.  For some years, I worked for David in his capacity as a mathematician/businessman.  He had determined a mathematical software to advise corporations on risk investments.  We have not been in contact for years now.</p><p>re Pelog vs. Slendro<br/>Since there are different variants for each and one must speak in most general terms,<br/>Pelog is formed from a set of intervals, such that there are skips and steps.  Slendro is a set of relative steps.</p><p>Johnny</p><p>________________________________________________________________________<br/>Check out <a href="http://AOL.com">AOL.com</a> today.
