We restrict ourselves to a 12 tones/octave scale, or less.</p><p>That&apos;s why I am looking for some pieces that are composed for just<br/>intonation that could be performed by a keyboardist.</p><p>For the purpose of the demonstration, it would be nice if these pieces<br/>would sound bad when played in equal temperament.</p><p>I thought of ancient greek music, but in fact we have no restriction<br/>about the period or the origin of the composition. The only<br/>restriction is that it should not be too technical to perform.</p><p>So all your suggestions are welcome! If you can inform me about<br/>archives where I could download some scores, it would also be very<br/>nice.</p><p>Thanks in advance, Emmanuel.</p></div><h3><a id=29009 href="#29009">ðŸ”—</a>manuel.op.de.coul@eon-benelux.com</h3><span>10/10/2001 8:06:49 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Emmanuel... wrote:<br/>&gt;That&apos;s why I am looking for some pieces that are composed for just<br/>&gt;intonation that could be performed by a keyboardist.</p><p>I don&apos;t know much JI music that&apos;s nonmicrotonal, let alone where to<br/>find scores of it.
