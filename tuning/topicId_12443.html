And this is the<br/>principle of placing accidentals in front of notes.  Already, there are<br/>&quot;normal&quot; 12-TET notes that have &quot;0&quot; changes from the grid.  Would you have a<br/>&quot;0&quot; placed above, leave it blank, or put something else like &quot;N&quot; for normal?</p><p>Using a half of the conventional system for accidental landmarks, aid the<br/>&quot;showhorse&quot; in rapidly playing notated music accurately.  Perhaps you guys<br/>are obsessing too much on the quartertone symbols as representing quartertone<br/>tuning.  These personal dislikes of 24-TET tuning need not impair what is<br/>still a 1200-TET method.</p><p>Relegating these considerations to &quot;personal preference&quot; may have the<br/>consequence of disregarding a player&apos;s orientation all together.  In other<br/>words, I will be able to play any cents specificity required of me by a<br/>composer, however, if I must always calculate notations differently, my speed<br/>in learning will be impacted negatively.</p><p>Johnny Reinhard</p></div><h3>Joseph Pehrson &#x3C;pehrson@pubmedia.com&#x3E;</h3><span>9/8/2000 1:18:37 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@egroups.com">tuning@egroups.com</a>, Afmmjr@a... wrote:</p><p><a href="http://www.egroups.com/message/tuning/12443">http://www.egroups.com/message/tuning/12443</a></p><p>&gt;<br/>&gt; Relegating these considerations to &quot;personal preference&quot; may have<br/>the consequence of disregarding a player&apos;s orientation all together.<br/>In other words, I will be able to play any cents specificity required<br/>of me by a composer, however, if I must always calculate notations<br/>differently, my speed in learning will be impacted negatively.</p><p>But Johnny... this statement of your seems to be supporting  MY OWN<br/>argument rather than yours...
