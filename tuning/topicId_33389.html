So at some<br/>point around 1200 someone did that, and we got &quot;major&quot; and<br/>&quot;minor 3rds&quot;.</p><p>&gt; &gt; It took a few centuries for the &quot;major/minor 3rd&quot; terminology<br/>&gt; &gt; to evolve.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Are you sure about that?

I think the Greeks had<br/>the *concept* of these varying and generic &quot;3rds&quot;, but not<br/>sure about how careful their taxonomy was.</p><p>The Latin terminology is derived directly from the Greek.<br/>Generally, you&apos;ll find that different flavors of &quot;3rds&quot;<br/>functioned as the &quot;characteristic interval&quot; of the various<br/>genera, so that the &quot;diatonic genus&quot; has a CI of a &quot;tone&quot;,<br/>the &quot;chromatic&quot; CI is a &quot;trihemitone&quot;, and the &quot;enharmonic&quot;<br/>CI is a &quot;ditone&quot;.  All Greek scales were categorized according<br/>to the genus to which they belonged.</p><p>So, the most informed answer I can give (perhaps someone else<br/>out there knows better) is no, the Greeks did not have a<br/>*terminology* corresponding to &quot;generic / major / minor 3rd&quot;.</p><p>&gt; &gt; But in Boethius&apos;s time, the qualifiers &quot;major&quot; and &quot;minor&quot;<br/>&gt; &gt; were only used for semitones.

Boethius&apos;s treatise<br/>became the *standard* reference on music-theory in Europe for<br/>1000 years!

However, I&apos;d argue that from a strictly<br/>_diatonic_ perspective (i.e., defined either by the usual pair of<br/>comma and chroma unison vectors, or solely by the Pythagorean apotome<br/>as chroma) if ever such a thing existed (I like to think it did),<br/>a &quot;semitone&quot; is really either a &quot;minor second&quot; or an &quot;augmented<br/>unison&quot; -- it is not really a single category unto itself, despite<br/>the coincidence of pitch in some tuning systems.</p><p>This sort of thing is very real in diatonic music perception. My 12th<br/>grade music teacher, Phil Rosenberg, would play some harmonic minor<br/>snippets on the piano, and then hit an interval, and ask &quot;consonant&quot;<br/>or &quot;dissonant&quot;. If that interval was a minor third in the context of<br/>the preceding scale, we&apos;d all say &quot;consonant&quot;. If it was an augmented<br/>second, &quot;dissonant&quot;. This despite the two intervals having exactly<br/>the same ratio, the fourth root of two, on the piano. That experiment<br/>pointed out to me the importance of _diatonic categorical perception_<br/>(as opposed to 12-tET categorical perception, which trained musicians<br/>seem to have overwhelming amounts of).

To Classical (Greek and Roman)<br/>&gt; &gt; theorists, keeping the sizes of different semitones straight was<br/>&gt; &gt; very important, as very often they thought in terms of tetrachord<br/>&gt; &gt; species, that is, the pattern of &quot;tones&quot; and &quot;semitones&quot; with a<br/>&gt; &gt; given tetrachord, which ordinarily would be replicated in other<br/>&gt; &gt; tetrachords at other parts of the scale.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; If thinking of a &quot;semitone&quot; as literally one of two parts of a tone,<br/>&gt; then this makes sense. However, I&apos;d argue that from a strictly<br/>&gt; _diatonic_ perspective (i.e., defined either by the usual pair of<br/>&gt; comma and chroma unison vectors, or solely by the Pythagorean apotome<br/>&gt; as chroma) if ever such a thing existed (I like to think it did),<br/>&gt; a &quot;semitone&quot; is really either a &quot;minor second&quot; or an &quot;augmented<br/>&gt; unison&quot; -- it is not really a single category unto itself, despite<br/>&gt; the coincidence of pitch in some tuning systems.</p><p>Well... OK, I can certainly buy your argument here.  *But* ...<br/>I&apos;m not sure if it has any application to music or music-theory<br/>of ancient Greek and Roman times, and my inclination is to say no.</p><p>Greek theorists certainly argued that *functional* notation<br/>was important -- this refers to the names &quot;mese&quot;, &quot;lichanos meson&quot;,<br/>etc. -- but I don&apos;t think they reckoned so much in terms of<br/>&quot;scale steps&quot;, as we do.</p><p>Their entire theory was based on, to quote the title of a great<br/>book by our dear friend John Chalmers, &quot;Divisions of the Tetrachord&quot;.<br/>The tetrachord was seen as a microcosm of the whole pitch-continuum,<br/>and was divided up in various ways which always consisted of<br/>three intervals (or in some really old cases, 3 notes and<br/>2 intervals).</p><p>These three particular intervals, which form a set unique to a<br/>particular genus (and possibly also &quot;shade&quot; of genus, i.e.,<br/>Aristoxenos&apos;s &quot;relaxed diatonic&quot;, etc.), along with the<br/>separate 9:8 &quot;whole tone&quot; which always appeared at some point<br/>in a Greek system as a &quot;tone of disjunction&quot; between tetrachords,<br/>were the building blocks of all other intervals in a Greek<br/>tuning.</p><p>So while a case could be made that they had a concept analagous<br/>to our &quot;minor second&quot; (I&apos;ll have to look into that one), there<br/>*definitely* was no such concept as &quot;augmented unison&quot;.</p><p>&gt; This sort of thing is very real in diatonic music perception.
