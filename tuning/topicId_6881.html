Your analysis was correct with the numbers by Ives<br/>indicating semitiones and halves of semitiones (for the 1/8th tones).</p><p>I have heard that there is a page of 1/8th tone scale calculations in the<br/>folder with the original manuscripts of the &quot;Three Quarter Tone Pieces&quot; for 2<br/>pianos.  Must follow up.  And the Belamann letter.  Of course.</p><p>Most interesting to me is the discussion of 48-TET by Ives in terms of<br/>non-octaves or other intervals that would suggest octave equivalence.  It&apos;s<br/>almost like the set theory I learned out of John Rahn&apos;s Atonality (where one<br/>avoids perfect fifths because they suggest tonal heirarchiy too strongly).</p><p>I don&apos;t know why, Joe, you are surprised by the double ententre (consider or<br/>reconsider) regarding the transcendentalism and its implications in the<br/>tuning.  It is perhaps transcendentalism than microtonalizes Ives&apos;s thinking.<br/> (Hmnnn.)</p><p>And will someone please figure out what a 261/712 is (Monz)?  Ives mentions<br/>it as an uneven interval.  Is he right?</p><p>Johnny Reinhard<br/>AFMM</p></div><h3><a id=6883 href="#6883">ðŸ”—</a>Dale Scott &#x3C;adelscott@xxxx.xxxxxx.xxxx&#x3E;</h3><span>Invalid Date Invalid Date</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>&gt;From: <a href="mailto:Afmmjr@aol.com">Afmmjr@aol.com</a></p><p>&gt;And will someone please figure out what a 261/712 is (Monz)?
