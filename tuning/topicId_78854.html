If<br/>he presents his ideas more coherently then more people will no doubt<br/>take up his cause if they turn out to have meaning and value.&quot;<br/>&quot;I joined your group and looked at your file section which appears to<br/>be filled with lots of data. So much data, in fact, that I was scared<br/>away because it was not immediately evident what it all meant. So I<br/>quit the group. Perhaps you can explain your ideas in more simple<br/>terms so that the more<br/>intellectually challenged musicians like myself can understand what<br/>you intend to convey. I am not hostile but I only devote a limited<br/>time to the tuning group and spend most of my spare time<br/>with my own group. An abstract of your thesis or idea would not go<br/>astray and would better serve your purposes.&quot;<br/>Really guys, I wanted to put any debate on the subject on my own blog<br/>against someone that is very willing to challenge it, rather than<br/>just a passive observer.  Oh well, I can just cut and paste and<br/>transfer conversations if I get something I can use.<br/>To repeat some of my disclaimers.  This is all self taught and a<br/>reinvention of the wheel.  Some in this group will find slogging<br/>through it a painful experience.  Some will enjoy the reinvention of<br/>the wheel because it suits their purposes for one reason or the other.<br/>What I have come up with that I think is new, at least new in print,<br/>is the &quot;coefficient of consonance.&quot;<br/>I use spread sheets to illustrate vibrations.  An x indicates one<br/>vibration.  To illustrate two identical tones, use two identical rows<br/>of x.  When one x occurs at the exact same time as another, the x<br/>will be one on top of the other on the spread sheet.  Color the<br/>bottom x red to indicate that it is invisible.   That is to say, when<br/>two vibrations occur at the exact same time, you will only be able to<br/>hear one of them.<br/>So there is a proportion or percentage of x that are invisible and<br/>visible.   At unison, half the x are invisible.  At 2/1 one third of<br/>the x are invisible.  At 3/2 one out of every five x are invisible,<br/>and so on and so forth.<br/>When you are making this calculation for more than two tones at the<br/>same time you are going to run into the problem that several x occur<br/>at the same time.  For instance, at the point of resolution of a<br/>triad, three x will be lined up vertically.  The bottom two will be<br/>colored red and considered invisible.  You can&apos;t define the bottom<br/>red x as being twice invisible in relation to the black and the red x<br/>above it.  So if you want to calculate consonance, and you don&apos;t want<br/>to manually count each red and black x, you have to add back in the<br/>invisible red x that has been counted invisible twice.<br/>This is where Bayesian probability comes into play.  You may recall<br/>from freshman year that it is taught in conjunction with Venn<br/>diagrams.  It uses circles and the capital U to indicate &quot;union,&quot; and<br/>an upside-down U to indicate intersection.  You might also find the<br/>formulas under the term &quot;set theory.&quot;  These are the formulas that<br/>are used to create my spread sheets.<br/>This is a superior method for representing consonance.  You are<br/>probably accustomed to seeing consonance represented by sine waves<br/>starting and converging on a point of resolution.  Any further<br/>analysis than that between the points of resolution is fruitless.  It<br/>is a repeating pattern.  The same can be said for my method.  The<br/>clear implication is that the point of resolution and how quickly you<br/>arrive at it determines consonance.  This is completely false for<br/>anything more than an interval.<br/>Take three tones.  A B C.  There are points of resolution between A &amp;<br/>B, B &amp; C, C &amp; A, and A &amp; B &amp; C.  Consonance can be attributed to all<br/>the points of resolution, not just A &amp; B &amp; C.<br/>I do make generalizations about consonance.  There are always<br/>exceptions.  If you study my results carefully, you will find that it<br/>is remarkably difficult to generalize about consonance at all.  The<br/>location of the combined point of resolution, or the point of<br/>resolution of all the tones taken together, happens to be totally<br/>useless in determining and measuring the consonance of a chord.  I&apos;ve<br/>seen supplements to college texts that use purely sine waves and<br/>points of resolution to teach consonance.  They sell for good money!<br/>Granted that I have such difficulty making generalizations about<br/>consonance, there can&apos;t be a corresponding definition of consonance<br/>that does not conflict with my definition.  You simply have to do the<br/>calculations to understand consonance.  [That is to say if you are<br/>using math rather than your ear, as has been pointed out to me.]<br/>To the best of my knowledge, no one has ever tried to prove that one<br/>chord is more consonant than another.  I ranked about every chord<br/>that I find useful in terms of consonance.<br/>So there!</p></div><h3><a id=78856 href="#78856">ðŸ”—</a>Carl Lumma &#x3C;carl@...&#x3E;</h3><span>10/30/2008 2:09:09 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>&gt; To the best of my knowledge, no one has ever tried to prove that one<br/>&gt; chord is more consonant than another.</p><p>Well then, you&apos;re way out of touch.
