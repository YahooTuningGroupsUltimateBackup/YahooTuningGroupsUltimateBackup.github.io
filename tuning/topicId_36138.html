Here we go!</p><p>Any particular meaning to this opening phrase, Bob?</p><p>&gt; I just listened to the first example<br/>&gt; called &quot;High Third&quot; at Jerry&apos;s Website on /soundpage.html. I also<br/>&gt; listened to the Root-Fifth-hi3 demo further down the list.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Here&apos;s what I hear, and I am rock solid sure of what I hear. I do<br/>&gt; work this fine all the time with my choir. (This is not to say<br/>&gt; they are always consistent or that I don&apos;t have to stay on it all the<br/>&gt; time. After all, they are amateur singers in rural southeast Iowa in<br/>&gt; the &quot;greater&quot; region around a town of 10,000 from which you have to<br/>&gt; drive a half hour in any direction to find anything more than a tenth<br/>&gt; its size.):</p><p>Isn&apos;t it a bit dangerous to assume that we are &quot;rock solid sure&quot; of what we<br/>hear? I have learned a lot about what I *think* I hear during my stay on the<br/>list, and in some cases found that I was mistaken. (Discovery of the high<br/>third &quot;illusion,&quot; for example.</p><p>Okay. Here we go.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; In the high third example -<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; 1) The first thing that happens is the basses are unsteady to the<br/>&gt; sharp side and do not stay cleanly in unison with the piano. One of<br/>&gt; the basses goes slightly sharp right away and stays there for the<br/>&gt; duration. The others oscillate slowly between him and the piano<br/>&gt; pitch. It&apos;s borderline, but enough so I would tend to make a<br/>&gt; correction to that pitch error in my choir.</p><p>Bob is right. The basses raise the pitch almost immediately. That, of<br/>course, makes the piano reference pitch closer to the women&apos;s 4:5 third. Too<br/>bad Bob wasn&apos;t there that day to catch the basses&apos; sharp root.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; 2) The sopranos sing very slightly high to a just third from the<br/>&gt; outset, probably prompted by the bass tendency to sharp slightly.<br/>&gt; When the piano sounds its third (these are actually tenths), the<br/>&gt; sopranos, led by one of them, swing immediately afterwards to the<br/>&gt; piano third and then on up beyond it well before the tenors&apos; entry on<br/>&gt; the fifth.</p><p>Also true. Evidently, one of the sopranos hears the piano comparison tone<br/>and (perhaps from habit) goes to it. The final &quot;resting place&quot; in the<br/>soprano pitch actually goes well beyond that piano third as can be heard<br/>when the piano re-sounds its reference third.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; 3) The tenors are tuned rather well to the just fifth initially and<br/>&gt; stay so tuned to the bass throughout, although they do drift upwards<br/>&gt; with the bass.</p><p>Once the tenors enter with their fifth, the pitch does not change. As I pop<br/>back and forth in the recording, the final root is consistently the same as<br/>before the sopranos first entered. (Too bad the basses started too high.)<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; 4) After the tenors enter on the fifth, the sopranos&apos; third actually<br/>&gt; lowers toward it a bit, but the bass has meanwhile drifted further<br/>&gt; upwards to retune with the high piano third, no other reference<br/>&gt; having been provided them since their initial pitch was given.</p><p>Actually, the basses don&apos;t move once they establish the pitch before the<br/>girls enter. Skip around on the recording (after the piano&apos;s initial pitch)<br/>and you&apos;ll hear no change.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; 5) The sopranos quickly drift back sharp to the piano third once<br/>&gt; again. Even though this third is high to the piano, it is only very<br/>&gt; slightly high to the bass, and the tenor has remained tuned a just<br/>&gt; fifth above the upward drifting bass. The so-called high third is<br/>&gt; indeed actually high to the absolute reference of the piano third,<br/>&gt; but the bass and tenor have shifted upward sufficiently to make the<br/>&gt; triad almost just. (No wonder the &quot;high third&quot; sounds so good.)</p><p>It is unfortunate that the basses began high. Nevertheless, one can hear the<br/>shift in the women&apos;s third (tenth-- Sorry Paul) in relation to the basses&apos;<br/>and tenors&apos; locked root/fifth. The main problem is that the effect is<br/>exaggerated here in relation to the piano&apos;s reference pitch.</p><p>Unfortunately, I don&apos;t have a choir anymore to go back and do it right. Bob,<br/>I suggest you do the &quot;experiment,&quot; and with your fine singers I&apos;m sure<br/>you&apos;ll do it better than I may have done with my novices. Then, let&apos;s talk.</p><p>&gt;<br/>&gt; The Root-Fifth-hi3 demo -<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; 1) The sung pitch here oscillates periodically and somewhat<br/>&gt; sporadically between a just and a sharp third. I found this demo<br/>&gt; quite amusing, since it clearly demonstrates the almost irresistable<br/>&gt; attraction the just third has for the ear in spite of the apparent<br/>&gt; attempt to sing sharp to it.<br/>&gt;<br/>Thanks for responding, Bob. By the way, those posts were intended simply to<br/>demonstrate what I *think*. They may not *prove* anything, particularly<br/>since they were sung by a 67 year old guy who can&apos;t sing a decent straight<br/>tone anymore. Believe me, that is not very &quot;amusing&quot; (as you put it) from<br/>*my* standpoint.</p><p>Did you listen to any of the others, Bob? You might have found those amusing<br/>also.</p><p>After listening to them again (and trying to ignore the wobbly pitch), I<br/>couldn&apos;t help but wonder how much difference there is between my 4:5 third<br/>and my high third, if any. Perhaps they are the same. Then we could all go<br/>back to doing something more productive. :-)</p><p>Hopefully, Francois will help in that regard.</p><p>Hope to get some more responses.</p><p>Jerry</p></div>
