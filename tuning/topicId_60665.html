Friday, September 23, 5:30 p.m., Duncan Recital Hall,<br/>Shepherd School of Music, Rice University. Only now did it occur to me that it would be<br/>worth mentioning here.</p><p>An old theme-and-variations for trumpet and piano, the newer Xenharmonic Variations on<br/>Mozart, music for 31-tone (tricesimoprimal is a more pretentious and thus much better<br/>word for it, I think) BASSOON(s) which constitute the beginnings of a method book, and a<br/>slide bottle trio, a sight to see.</p><p>If you&apos;re busy or live too far away or would prefer to avoid bassoon recitals (why the<br/>chicken REALLY crossed the road), don&apos;t fret. It&apos;ll be recorded one way or another.</p><p>Love,<br/>Jacob</p></div>
