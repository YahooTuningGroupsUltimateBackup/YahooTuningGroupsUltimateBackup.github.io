Schulter &#x3C;MSCHULTER@VALUE.NET&#x3E;</h3><span>6/26/2000 11:58:09 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Hello, there, Graham, and thank you for your very extensive remarks<br/>and examples on the &quot;septimal schisma&quot; question. It is fascinating to<br/>see how the same kind of intonational scheme -- a Pythagorean or<br/>quasi-Pythagorean tuning in 17 or more notes per octave -- can lead in<br/>various musical directions.</p><p>&gt; I haven&apos;t worked out the minimum number of notes from the spiral of<br/>&gt; fifths required for this to work, but I suspect it will be more than<br/>&gt; 17.  Margo, how many do you have?  Is it 17 tuned to 24 keys, or do<br/>&gt; you get all 24?</p><p>Xeno-Gothic definitely uses all 24, mapped to two keyboards tuned a<br/>Pythagorean comma apart -- a &quot;generalized&quot; keyboard where the two<br/>manuals have identical intervals.</p><p>In fact, with only 17 (a tuning described in Europe in the early 15th<br/>century), for example, we get only major third a comma wide, between<br/>the two extreme notes of the tuning, Gb-A# in the medieval example.</p><p>On a Xeno-Gothic keyboard, by the way, the notation often rather<br/>nicely reflects the fingering. For example, in</p><p>D@4 C@4<br/>B3  C@4<br/>G@3 F@3<br/>E3  F@3</p><p>we play the fifth E3-B3 on one keyboard and the fifth G@3-D@4 on the<br/>other in the first sonority, and these two fifths &quot;merge&quot; into F@3-C@4<br/>on the keyboard where we played the fifth G@3-D@4.</p><p>Curiously, my original convention was to have the &quot;usual&quot; keyboard as<br/>the physically lower one, and the keyboard a Pythagorean comma lower<br/>as the upper one -- but this is totally arbitrary. Psychologically, I<br/>suspect that this convention reflects the idea that the lower keyboard<br/>has a &quot;classic&quot; 14th-century range of Eb-G#, so the upper one will<br/>have the less common Ab (making a pure fifth with Eb on the lower<br/>keyboard) on the key corresponding to G# on the lower keyboard.</p><p>&gt; As the distinction between the 3- and 7-limit progressions is lost,<br/>&gt; it seems that this breaks the spirit of Xeno-Gothic: that you can<br/>&gt; choose the commas.  Although the 5-7 distinction is still there.</p><p>Yes, I agree that &quot;Xeno-Gothic&quot; does imply a choice of commas, so the<br/>more general term &quot;neo-Gothic&quot; might be appropriate for a medievalist<br/>approach to 17-tet.</p><p>Might I ask more about this &quot;5-7&quot; distinction in 17-tet? The loss of<br/>the comma distinctions is, of course, clear -- maybe analogous to the<br/>loss in meantone of the 5-limit distinction between 9:8 and 10:9, or<br/>16:9 and 9:5. However, unlike either Xeno-Gothic or 22-tet, 17-tet<br/>doesn&apos;t have any close 5-odd-limit approximations, although on a more<br/>complex level the 17-tet step is almost identical to a 25:24.</p><p>Please let me thank you again very warmly for your experiments, and<br/>for sharing a very subtle keyboard layout which I need to study more<br/>closely. I am especially moved that, using your own expertise and<br/>feeling for fine distinctions in schisma tunings, you took my<br/>progression and optimized it for what you found a moving musical<br/>experience.</p><p>Dialogues like this may make a point that people can look at the same<br/>tunings and mathematical relationships from many musical points of<br/>view, and that sharing these points of view can lend perspective to<br/>all.</p><p>Again, thank you for your thoughtful words, your patient experiments,<br/>and your helpful Web site.</p><p>Most appreciatively,</p><p>Margo</p></div>
