It is:</p><p>   The Listening Book : Discovering Your Own Music<br/>   by W. A. Mathieu, Emily Sell (Editor)<br/>   Shambhala Pubns; ISBN: 0877736103</p><p>The book is about a lot more than just listening and is full of lots of<br/>examples to get you playing/improvising/composing.</p><p>The author also talks (a little) about playing with pitches outside of<br/>12tET, singing against drones to explore pitch relationships, etc., so I<br/>figured that makes this an on-topic post.  ;-)</p><p>Seriously though, especially if you want something to inspire you to<br/>play/improvise/compose more, I highly recommend this great little book.</p><p>When I first picked up the book and read a couple of pages here and<br/>there I though some of it sounded rather silly, but before long I<br/>started to appreciate the book as a whole and now I&apos;ve dog-eared so many<br/>pages that the top right edge of the book is significantly thicker than<br/>the rest of the book.  :-)</p><p>Here&apos;s an example: the author suggests as one possible division of music<br/>practice time (though he says one should be flexible and not limit<br/>oneself to this):</p><p>   1/4 time spent working on technique<br/>   1/4 time spent playing other people&apos;s music<br/>   1/4 time spent playing/improvising/composing your own music<br/>   1/4 time spent listening to music</p><p>Before reading this book I was mainly working on technique and playing<br/>other people&apos;s music and not spending much time actually listening or<br/>working on my own music.  I find that allocating time to listen and to<br/>create my own music has really made my practice time more fulfilling.<br/>:-)</p><p>Cheers,<br/>Christopher</p></div>
