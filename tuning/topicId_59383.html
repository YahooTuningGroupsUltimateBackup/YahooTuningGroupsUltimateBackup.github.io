That certainly<br/>&gt; makes sense, but now we have a different setup--one more likely to<br/>&gt; produce smaller intervals than the defining comma. The resulting 25<br/>&gt; note scale in this instance has two intervals of 4096/4095, and two of<br/>&gt; 351/350, with the remaining intervals much larger. Hence it would<br/>&gt; certainly make sense to &quot;temper out&quot; 4096/4095 and 351/350, for<br/>&gt; instance by using 130 equal. It is possible to temper out only these<br/>&gt; two commas, producing what is called a planar temperament, since the<br/>&gt; octave equivalent note classes lie in a plane, like 5-limit just<br/>&gt; intonation.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt; I remind seeing this oriental beauty between 128/117 and 35/32<br/>&gt;&gt; I used it in a disk I called &quot;Yantra&quot;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Have you been reading Ernest McClain?<br/>No, why ?</p><p>&gt; Are any samples of your music available on-line ?<br/>Not much, only 3 very short samples of my CD &quot;Lumi&egrave;res audibles&quot; (Sounding<br/>lights at <a href="http://aeh.free.fr">http://aeh.free.fr</a> (page .mp3) - I am on the way to several new<br/>albums, but slowly.<br/>The reason I called 4096/4095 Yantra is related with the famous indian<br/>mandala called &quot;Sri Yantra&quot; - when you place the divisors of 4095 on a<br/>logarithmic representation of the octave, with 4095 on the summit,<br/>you have a perfect symmetry between the divisors and many horizontal lines<br/>between them (such as 105-395 or 13-315) out of which you may find some kind<br/>of possible construction of the &quot;Sri Yantra&quot; triangles.

How do you tune 64/63 using two 5ths and a single 7th?<br/>Maybe you mean two 4ths? Meanwhile, I can tune 50/49 easily using two<br/>7:5s and a 2:1. The 7:5s are harder than 4ths (4:3), but the 2:1 is<br/>much easier than the 7th (7:4), so the two intervals are pretty close<br/>in terms of &apos;tunability&apos;. I can think of other ways of tuning 50/49<br/>that may appear slightly easier still, for example a 7:5, a 7:2, and<br/>a 1:5.</p><p>&gt; I have yet to find a technique that you suggested that jives with<br/>how easily<br/>&gt; these comma are tuned: save the simple square lattice taxicab<br/>distance.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; d) square lattice taxicab distance<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; ....remains the most accurate</p><p>It doesn&apos;t look like you&apos;ve even thought about the alternatives, let<br/>alone really evaluated them.

You seem to be just ignoring those points.</p><p>&gt; Why this works you have every theoretical reason to dislike,<br/>however, your<br/>&gt; metrics fail when considering &apos;ease&apos;.<br/>&gt; If you disagree, I challenge you to come up with a 7-limit comma<br/>smaller than<br/>&gt; the septimal comma in three or less steps in *any* metric of your<br/>choosing.</p><p>Which of the metrics claim there should be one? And how do you<br/>define &quot;steps&quot; in the case of Tenney or van Prooijen distance?</p><p>&gt; When you fail, you will see why it should be the top of the list.<br/>And you<br/>&gt; will see why your metrics fail when they *don&apos;t* put it there.</p><p>They don&apos;t fail. Perhaps you expected them to fail, but since you<br/>didn&apos;t even try them, you have no basis for making this claim.

The &quot;reconciliation&quot; given by this book is a<br/>shallow and forced one, largely because it completely glosses over the<br/>crucial &quot;middle path&quot; of meantone tuning that Western music went<br/>through for about three centuries, but also for various other reasons<br/>I&apos;ve discussed before (for example, his valid &apos;commas&apos; include only<br/>those which are *both* under 50 cents *and* vanish in 12-equal -- could<br/>the goal of 12-equal be more preconceived?)

How do you tune 64/63 using two 5ths and a single 7th?<br/>&gt; Maybe you mean two 4ths?</p><p>Like Gene said elsewhere, because he understands what I&apos;m saying, octaves are<br/>freebies, and inversions can be used for ease.</p><p>&gt; Meanwhile, I can tune 50/49 easily using two<br/>&gt; 7:5s and a 2:1. The 7:5s are harder than 4ths (4:3), but the 2:1 is<br/>&gt; much easier than the 7th (7:4), so the two intervals are pretty close<br/>&gt; in terms of &apos;tunability&apos;. I can think of other ways of tuning 50/49<br/>&gt; that may appear slightly easier still, for example a 7:5, a 7:2, and<br/>&gt; a 1:5.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; I have yet to find a technique that you suggested that jives with<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; how easily<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; these comma are tuned: save the simple square lattice taxicab<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; distance.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; d) square lattice taxicab distance<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; ....remains the most accurate<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; It doesn&apos;t look like you&apos;ve even thought about the alternatives, let<br/>&gt; alone really evaluated them.

Again, I&apos;m not interested<br/>in the harmonic aspect of the lattice, just the comma tuning aspect.</p><p>&gt; &gt; Why this works you have every theoretical reason to dislike,<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; however, your<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; metrics fail when considering &apos;ease&apos;.<br/>&gt; &gt; If you disagree, I challenge you to come up with a 7-limit comma<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; smaller than<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; the septimal comma in three or less steps in *any* metric of your<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; choosing.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Which of the metrics claim there should be one? And how do you<br/>&gt; define &quot;steps&quot; in the case of Tenney or van Prooijen distance?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; When you fail, you will see why it should be the top of the list.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; And you<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; will see why your metrics fail when they *don&apos;t* put it there.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; They don&apos;t fail.

Perhaps you can send me your code, and we can compare notes.</p><p>&gt; In<br/>&gt; fact, both the Tenney and van Prooijen metrics say that 64:63 is the<br/>&gt; smallest comma for its distance.

How about 648:625 vs. 2048:2025.<br/>Which one do you consider more &apos;tunable&apos;, and why?</p><p>&gt; Again, you&apos;re accusing me of lying.</p><p>Ouch -- I&apos;m terribly sorry about that.</p><p>&gt;I *did* try them, but maybe not using your<br/>&gt; script/formula. Perhaps you can send me your code, and we can<br/>&gt;compare notes.</p><p>Hmm . . . I thought I gave you the formulas both here and in my<br/>paper. I don&apos;t have any code to send you because the formulas are<br/>very simple and I can always calculate them on the fly. Send me your<br/>code and I&apos;ll have a go at correcting it.</p><p>&gt;&gt; &gt; In<br/>&gt;&gt; &gt; fact, both the Tenney and van Prooijen metrics say that 64:63 is<br/>the<br/>&gt;&gt; &gt; smallest comma for its distance. The chart I showed you was<br/>saying as<br/>&gt;&gt; &gt; much.</p><p>&gt;&gt; Well, the only way this works is distance from 8/7 squared over<br/>log Tenney. But how would you justify that arbitrary measure?</p><p>Huh? I don&apos;t get it. What do you mean?? Let me repeat: both the<br/>Tenney and van Prooijen metrics say that 64:63 is the smallest comma<br/>for its distance (or closer). What 8/7? What squared . . . what<br/>arbitrary measure?</p><p>Sorry, I&apos;m really trying to understand you, but the train seems to<br/>have temporarily left the tracks . . .</p><p>Best,<br/>Paul</p></div><h3>wallyesterpaulrus &#x3C;wallyesterpaulrus@yahoo.com&#x3E;</h3><span>7/26/2005 1:48:53 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, Aaron Krister Johnson &lt;aaron@a...&gt; wrote:</p><p>&gt; Like Gene said elsewhere, because he understands what I&apos;m saying,<br/>octaves are<br/>&gt; freebies, and inversions can be used for ease.</p><p>Then I only need two steps to tune a 50/49: 7:5, and then another 7:5.</p><p>BTW, since you asked about other interval tunable in three steps -- in<br/>three pretty easy steps, I can reach 126/125: 7:5, 3:5, and another<br/>3:5.
