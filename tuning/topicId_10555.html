For<br/>&gt; example, since you enjoy the effect of a 6-tone scale, with &quot;tritones&quot;<br/>&gt; sounding like &quot;octaves&quot;, you could explore all kinds of 6-tone scales found<br/>&gt; within 12-tET and find endless fascination in doing so (no facetiousness<br/>&gt; intended). However, that is not really the subject of this list.</p><p>Actually, I&apos;m doing this now...  The Scala mapping function was really<br/>not difficult to use at all, once I looked at it (!!)  The comments are<br/>very clear in the text file, so all a person has to do is replace the<br/>values.  My first grand &quot;oeuvre&quot; was to turn the first 6 notes of the<br/>keyboard pattern (YES, with tritones as octaves!) into a repeating<br/>whole-tone scale.  More &quot;surprises&quot; to follow.  Frankly, I was happy to<br/>hear that Margo Schulter found that unusual keyboard patterns derived<br/>simply from 12-tET were &quot;xeno&quot; enough for this list... I would think so,<br/>too...  However, of course, I wouldn&apos;t want to limit myself to that...</p><p>Now, what do I do with the other 6 keys (??)<br/>_______________ ________ ____ __ _<br/>Joseph Pehrson</p></div>
