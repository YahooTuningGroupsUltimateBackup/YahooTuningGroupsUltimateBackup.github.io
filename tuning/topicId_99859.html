Those near-Just 5/3&apos;s are just so damn sweet, and for some reason I also find the 4ths and 5ths drastically less objectionable despite a mere 3-4 cents difference.</p><p>I feel the same way sometimes about the fifths. I think it has to do<br/>with the fact that because the 5/4&apos;s are also so flat, it warps your<br/>brain into hearing the flat 3/2&apos;s as being &quot;right&quot; in a way that<br/>16-EDO doesn&apos;t accomplish. I&apos;ve noticed a similar effect under lots of<br/>different circumstances, where sharper fifths demand sharper thirds<br/>and etc. 23-equal is also a lot closer to the POTE-optimal tuning for<br/>mavila; POTE likewise has it set up so that flatter 5/4&apos;s demand<br/>flatter 3/2&apos;s and so on (one of the reasons why the father mapping for<br/>13-EDO kept winning out over the uncle one as well; the algorithm<br/>suggested a sharper 5/4 to go with the sharper 3/2). I think that<br/>23-equal is the optimal patent val for mavila as well.</p><p>But as for 16-EDO - the schizophrenia of the way intervals are<br/>mistuned is actually I think a huge asset to 16-EDO. The 3/2&apos;s are so<br/>flat so as to be almost stifling, depressing perhaps, but the 5/4&apos;s<br/>are much less so and the 7/4&apos;s are actually a bit sharp, and suddenly<br/>these intervals lend the tuning some brightness and color (relatively<br/>speaking). This contradiction seems to contribute much to the<br/>&quot;feeling&quot; of 16-EDO, where it&apos;s somehow very confining, and yet<br/>freeing in a way; it has almost a gothic sort of feel to it. It feels<br/>like you&apos;re floating around in a fog, or maybe that you&apos;re a ghost or<br/>something, but the 5/4&apos;s can penetrate through the fog. I find it to<br/>have a more immediate meaning than most other EDOs, to be honest.</p><p>23-EDO on the other hand, by virtue of its uniformly flat major triad,<br/>doesn&apos;t have the same kind of schizophrenic &quot;bad fifth good third&quot;<br/>type thing going on, but rather the entire thing has a more cohesive<br/>feel to it. It is more uniformly &quot;mavila.&quot; The whole thing blends into<br/>a new sound in which all intervals are uniformly flat. At least that&apos;s<br/>my interpretation.</p><p>This also reinforces my understanding of mistuning as one of the<br/>&quot;primary foundations&quot; of a single harmonic percept, with flatness and<br/>sharpness representing the two different polarities that this can go.<br/>It lastly also suggests to me that the absurd and oversimplified<br/>paradigm whereby mistuning is &quot;bad&quot; and pure tuning is &quot;good&quot; is in<br/>fact absurd and oversimplified after all.</p><p>&gt; I am completely in love with 23-EDO. This is definitely my &quot;desert island&quot; tuning. I have a sinking feeling that I may come to neglect my other microtonal guitars in the future.

Take the case of Blackwood, where you can set the major third<br/>to be whatever you want. The POTE generators for Blackwood are 240<br/>cents and 80.406 cents, which if you works it out gives you a fourth<br/>of 399.59 cents. Note that the algorithm selects a sharper third to go<br/>with a sharper fifth. The idea is that we want to optimize the error<br/>for &quot;all&quot; intervals, and when you try to minimize dyadic error over<br/>all intervals this is a pretty common behavior that results.*</p><p>Look here at the choice of 7/4 that minimizing TE error picks for 23-equal -</p><p><a href="http://x31eq.com/cgi-bin/rt.cgi?ets=23&limit=7">http://x31eq.com/cgi-bin/rt.cgi?ets=23&limit=7</a></p><p>The 23d mapping is the optimal mapping here, with 23p coming in second<br/>place. That means that 18\23 is winning out over 19\23, despite that<br/>19\23 is the choice you get by rounding 7/4 to its nearest match in<br/>23-equal (the patent val).</p><p>18\23 is 939 cents, so that means the POTE-optimal 4:5:6:7 tuning for<br/>23-equal is 0-365-678-939. 939 cents! In comparison, the closest match<br/>to 7/4 directly is 991 cents, and the patent val 4:5:6:7 tuning is<br/>0-365-678-991. So the question is, which one to you sounds more like a<br/>just 4:5:6:7? To me it&apos;s the first one.</p><p>(*This obviously isn&apos;t the case for something like porcupine, though,<br/>where the only way to get it as close to 4:5:6 as possible is to go<br/>with a slightly flat 5/4 and a slightly sharp 3/2.)</p><p>-Mike</p></div><h3>genewardsmith &#x3C;genewardsmith@...&#x3E;</h3><span>6/10/2011 8:49:43 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;cityoftheasleep&quot; &lt;igliashon@...&gt; wrote:</p><p>&gt; It&apos;s near POTE-optimal for Pelogic, not Mavila.  25-EDO is more of an optimal Mavila.</p><p>Speaking of which, has anyone tried composing in 25?

I find that the &quot;texture&quot; of accurate 5-limit music is pretty much the same, whether it&apos;s rendered in Porcupine or Meantone or Diaschismic or Negri...though I think calling Porcupine 5-limit is silly since there are serious 11-limit implications everywhere in it.</p><p>&gt; Abstract models (such as analyzing an equal temperament<br/>&gt; in terms of a harmonic series) should aid us in reaching<br/>&gt; consistent conclusions about reality.  Using harmonics<br/>&gt; 32-64 with a brick wall 8-cent error cutoff won&apos;t do that.</p><p>I disagree.  The &quot;reality&quot; is that harmonics 32-64 each have a sound (or at least a texture) that people can and have learned to recognize.  How easily they can be recognized is of no more concern than how much mistuning a 7/4 can tolerate before it stops sounding like a 7/4--these are issues that depend on listener and listening environment.  Admittedly the 8-cent error cutoff is mutable, but it&apos;s arrived at from a reasonably sensitive proposition.  If you combine two tempered intervals with an error of 8 cents (of the same sign), you get a new interval whose error is 16 cents, which is about as much as the worst 12-TET deviation from a 5-limit consonance.  Insisting on no more than 8 cents of error ensures that any given temperament will be at least as accurate as 12-TET.  But in any case there are always many ways to interpret a tuning, and I&apos;m offering my approach as a supplement to, rather than a replacement for, the approach used and pioneered here.</p><p>In any case, I don&apos;t subscribe to the view that as musicians, we must shackle ourselves to hard psychoacoustic truths about &quot;reality&quot; and ignore an approach just because it is not substantiated under the current state of psychoacoustic knowledge.  Tuning systems are validated by music made with them, and the only reason to subscribe to any paradigm of alternative tunings is as a guide for making music.  You may say people are fooling themselves into thinking higher harmonics are identifiable, but thinking in terms of higher harmonics allows people to organize pitches in different ways than restricting to the lower ones.  If those methods lead to good music (as they seem to do, in the case of Kraig Grady and Johnny Reinhard and Dante Rosati, among others), then the real fool is the person who insists against the use of such approaches.</p><p>&gt; WTF is an &quot;equal-hertz&quot; chord and why is this bullshit<br/>&gt; in the wiki?</p><p>Presumably it is a chord in which the first-order difference tones all share the same frequency.

He then treats the two as separate tonal systems,<br/>which in modern parlance means he&apos;s now detempering the 25/24, and<br/>works out the &quot;meta&quot; generator for each of them, labeling the results<br/>&quot;meta-mavila&quot; and &quot;meta-meantone&quot; in the same way we might talk about<br/>&quot;TOP mavila&quot; or &quot;TOP meantone.&quot; There are other fifth-based systems in<br/>7-tet (what about the one where four fifths gets you to 125/96) but<br/>these are the main points.</p><p>One interesting thing you can do with the meta-tunings is to start by<br/>figuring out the meta-generator for a linear temperament, and then do<br/>some secret voodoo math, and somehow you then end up with the<br/>recurrent sequence of harmonics that approaches that generator. For<br/>example, 2000:2992:4464:6672:9984 is a meta-meantone chain of fifths<br/>derived in this way. This means that the major chord is<br/>2000:2496:2992, which is actually 125:156:187, which an &quot;isoharmonic&quot;<br/>chord with a constant difference of 31.

Do you want to force Dante Rosati to admit that the intervals on his prime harmonics 17-199 guitar are not any different than randomly-tuned intervals, so that he scrapes the frets off it and replaces them with Blackjack?  Are you going to start charging into discussions of 5-limit JI and decrying the existence of the 40/27 wolf-fifth...&quot;sorry guys, 40/27 is no different in sound than any other randomly-tuned dissonance, so you guys have to stop using that ratio in your discussions because it&apos;s psychoacoustically meaningless.&quot;</p><p>&gt; Writing about ratios and cents isn&apos;t musicianship, it&apos;s<br/>&gt; quantitative music theory.  Like any quantitative endeavor,<br/>&gt; it must produce consistent conclusions about reality or it&apos;s<br/>&gt; useless-- or worse, misleading.  Hate to &quot;shackle&quot; you but<br/>&gt; nothing can free us from this basic fact.</p><p>Bullshit.  This is music, not science.  The constraint placed upon music theory has nothing to do with &quot;reality&quot; and everything to do with &quot;aesthetics&quot;.  We&apos;re not making &quot;conclusions&quot;, we&apos;re making ART.</p><p>But in any case, just because it might be difficult to recognize a bare dyadic high-harmonic ratio in isolation, that does not mean music made with said harmonics will be difficult to recognize.  I can tell the difference between 14-EDO and 12-EDO and 17-EDO and 19-EDO, and I suspect you can too.  And hey, guess how we do that?  By recognize the characteristic sounds of the tunings of the intervals in each tuning.  I can tell the sound of 14-EDO because it&apos;s got 4ths and 5ths that beat moderately, a piquant supermajor 3rd that doesn&apos;t quite buzz, a slightly awkward submajor 2nd, a flat subminor 3rd that&apos;s a bit rough, etc.  If I can recognize those intervals as being characteristic of 14-EDO, why should it be any harder for me to recognize music made with, say, harmonics 25, 37, 39, 41, and 43?  As it turns out, those harmonics all sound almost exactly like intervals from 14-EDO.  Wow, I guess this means if I can recognize those intervals as being from 14-EDO, I should just as easily be able to recognize them as being those harmonics, as long as I do a little bit of mental training so that I think &quot;41st harmonic&quot; instead of &quot;14-EDO supermajor 3rd&quot; when I hear that interval.</p><p>Seems like in your view, I shouldn&apos;t be able to hear that interval as anything but a 9/7...or maybe even a 5/4.  But it&apos;s obviously not a Just version of either of those, it&apos;s mistuned in a particular and audible way.  Saying I can&apos;t recognize the 41st harmonic is basically saying I can&apos;t tell the difference between a 9/7 that&apos;s tuned 8 cents flat and one that&apos;s tuned 16 cents flat.</p><p>&gt; I haven&apos;t heard any of them claim to be able to recognize<br/>&gt; every harmonic up to 64 or that such a skill has been<br/>&gt; useful in music-making.  Other outlandish claims have been<br/>&gt; made though (such as the ability to distinguish and perform<br/>&gt; at will on a variety of instruments any interval with<br/>&gt; 1-cent accuracy).</p><p>And yet, there they go, making music with those higher harmonics.  They clearly find something useful about thinking in terms of them, and even if it&apos;s true that no one can recognize them, that doesn&apos;t actually matter, because (as I keep saying), the important thing is how the theory leads to music.  We&apos;re not trying to build a fucking space elevator or cure brain cancer here.  Music does not deal in reality, music deals in fantasy.  Music theory guides people in making music, which is to say it guides people in constructing fantasies.  FANTASY, Carl.</p><p>And hey, you know what else is a fantasy?

By recognize the characteristic sounds of the tunings of the intervals in each tuning.</p><p>1) The average person can&apos;t identify every interval in 12-EDO from one<br/>another. That&apos;s why people need to take ear training classes to learn<br/>to identify intervals. I believe I&apos;ve read that either the major sixth<br/>or the minor 7th is the hardest to identify, usually. So by this<br/>reasoning, 12-EDO is a scam, and the average person can&apos;t identify<br/>12-EDO music.</p><p>2) The above is absurd, obviously, because music does not consist of<br/>bare dyads separated by long spaces of silence, as a wise man once put<br/>it. But when you play a major third, and then you go up a half step to<br/>a fourth, the average person will be able to figure out where you&apos;ve<br/>moved to in the scale - as evidenced by the fact that people can carry<br/>simple melodies.</p><p>Whether or not someone can identify a bare dyad offhand from the<br/>harmonic series means nothing. The ability to find your way in a<br/>musical setting means everything. There&apos;s more going on than just<br/>harmonic entropy in musical cognition.</p><p>If you play an octave, and then you move down 17 cents, a listener<br/>with enough training will probably be able to figure out that this<br/>melodic motion has put you at the 63rd harmonic. And if they all start<br/>to blend together somewhere in the middle, then that would just become<br/>part of the music - you&apos;d know not to just start off playing random<br/>harmonics in the middle because you&apos;d lose your place and not be able<br/>to follow. You know, just like people have learned to not play random<br/>ass notes in 12-equal because then they can&apos;t figure out what&apos;s going<br/>on.</p><p>But you could, even so, start off in the middle, so long as you have a<br/>way to find your way around. Luckily, since 64 is a power of 2, there<br/>are low-entropy &quot;guide tones&quot; all over the place, with higher-entropy<br/>or ambiguous ones interspersed logarithmically in between them. If you<br/>lose your way, mentally, you can always get back on track as soon as<br/>someone hits a simpler interval that you recognize, like 7/4. Then you<br/>have a good strategy for finding your way. If you used a strong enough<br/>timbre, the periodicity buzz alone would be a hell of a clue you for<br/>when you&apos;ve hit a simpler harmonic. Who knows what kinds of (possibly<br/>redundant) coding strategies someone would come up with to map this<br/>space out if this is what they wanted to do?</p><p>In fact, it might even be that the harmonics with root 64 would<br/>function best as &quot;chromatic&quot; notes, whereas the ones that reduce to<br/>denominator 32 or even 16 work as the main ones. Then you&apos;d learn not<br/>to hang around on the /64 harmonics for too long, because they sound<br/>ambiguous and you lose your cognitive foothold on what&apos;s going on, so<br/>they might work best as passing tones between the more important and<br/>simpler harmonics. I don&apos;t know exactly how people would learn to get<br/>around, but I do know that any psychoacoustic limitations would become<br/>part of the model; people would become aware of them, and they&apos;d just<br/>be met with people learning to cognize things in other ways. If one<br/>coding strategy fails, that doesn&apos;t mean another can&apos;t take its place.</p><p>-Mike</p></div><h3>Herman Miller &#x3C;hmiller@...&#x3E;</h3><span>6/12/2011 6:53:44 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>On 6/11/2011 11:01 PM, Mike Battaglia wrote:<br/>&gt; Igs actually suggested that the one we&apos;re calling Hexadecimal/Pelogic<br/>&gt; should actually be called Armodue, for obvious reasons.

And when it really does get ambiguous - say you&apos;re apt<br/>to confuse 61/64 and 62/64 or something, because they&apos;re so close<br/>together - then that will work its way into the way that people<br/>cognize the music, because people will know not to just start randomly<br/>playing harmonics near the top, just like they know that playing<br/>random notes in 12-tet sounds confusing and terrible. You&apos;d have to<br/>start with some kind of identifiable signpost to help someone mentally<br/>find their way throughout the scale, like a just 7/4 or something, and<br/>then move around from there.</p><p>It would be pretty confusing if I played a melody consisting of random<br/>notes on a 12-tet piano. If, on the other hand, I had a melody that<br/>was mostly diatonic, but interspersed chromatic notes between the<br/>diatonic ones, it&apos;ll be much less confusing. Maybe it&apos;d naturally work<br/>out that people would think of harmonics 8-16 would be the &quot;diatonic&quot;<br/>ones, there to help you &quot;find your way&quot; so to speak, that the<br/>remainders from 16-32 would be more like the &quot;chromatic&quot; ones that<br/>pass between 8-16, and then that the ones left over 32-64 would be the<br/>equivalent of quartertones or something like that. And although<br/>something like 41/32 would probably sound exactly like 4/3, there&apos;s<br/>nothing stopping you from also being aware of how it fits to nearby<br/>intervals like 21/16 and 11/8 in the harmonic series - just like<br/>you&apos;re aware of how things in meantone can function more than one way<br/>because of the 81/80 pun.

Then, if I<br/>shift back to 12-equal, suddenly the 400 cent major third will sound<br/>wrong, and the 200 cent whole step as well. After a few seconds I<br/>adjust again. This seems to apply even if we&apos;re dealing with diatonic<br/>scales as diverse as 17-equal and 26-equal. Although you seem to have<br/>spent much of your time learning to distinguish between different<br/>intervals - my recent explorations into exotemperaments have led me to<br/>try and identify their similarities. So I might say that things sound<br/>similar in more ways than you might.</p><p>Lastly, I should say that I&apos;m not sure how useful the grid of<br/>reference provided by the harmonic series up around the highest part<br/>of the chunk we&apos;re looking at, like 54-64 say, will be - I think I&apos;d<br/>find it very confusing if you hit random harmonics and asked me to<br/>guess which is which. But I think that where it gets ambiguous, I&apos;d<br/>just develop another coding strategy to find my way mentally around<br/>the scale; I&apos;d find some kind of undeniably familiar intervals (like<br/>56/24, which would be 7/4) and then I&apos;d get a handle on what&apos;s going<br/>on that way. You don&apos;t need to know every single note in 31-tet to be<br/>able to find your way around it, and I don&apos;t think you&apos;d need to learn<br/>all of the harmonics from 32-64 to get the gist of how to move around<br/>the 32-note scale either.</p><p>I will say that my belief in HE as a strict law of the universe has<br/>waned a bit since I got my AXiS and set up my iPhone synth and started<br/>playing more music. It&apos;s pretty simple - in 17-equal, when I was<br/>trying to get a grip on what was going on, I first figured out that<br/>7\17 was obviously the 4/3 (or the &quot;fourth&quot;), and that 9\17 was the<br/>tritone, and then 8\17 was the ambiguous interval between them,<br/>sometimes sounding kind of like a tritone. So now that I know all of<br/>this theory, I&apos;m aware that this ambiguous interval can actually<br/>function as a really awesome, rooted, &quot;otonal&quot;-sounding interval in<br/>chords, because it&apos;s also 11/8. After playing with such chords in<br/>17-equal for a while, and while writing the etude, I started<br/>experimenting with the bare dyad outside of the chord. I wasn&apos;t all<br/>that surprised to find that the otonal sound of 11/8, the one I was<br/>exploring in chords, started then to then carry over to the dyad; it<br/>started sounding less ambiguous, which says something about how<br/>learning affects psychoacoustics. It&apos;s kind of like how when you sing<br/>C-E, it still sounds like a major third, even though you never<br/>actually play notes in the dyad at the same time. &quot;Root-finding&quot; is<br/>what we&apos;re after here, and it&apos;s very influenced by learning. Have I<br/>sent you the &quot;Frere Jacques&quot; study yet, btw? You&apos;d probably appreciate<br/>it.</p><p>I should point out that I&apos;m not really sure that you hate the HE model<br/>as much as you think that you do - you mainly seem to disagree with<br/>certain aspects of specifically Carl&apos;s interpretation of the HE curve.<br/>You should try asking Paul about it directly and see if you find his<br/>interpretation more appealing. In some ways he has a very different<br/>take on it, and being as he&apos;s the one who invented it it&apos;s worth<br/>hearing what he has to say. For instance, he&apos;s always encouraging me<br/>to get into Javanese singing and other &quot;high-entropy&quot; forms of music,<br/>because he thinks it just requires a little bit of adaptation to get<br/>used to, and he didn&apos;t intend for the model to have anything to do<br/>with learning - it&apos;s an intentionally basic model that doesn&apos;t take<br/>learning into account at all.</p><p>As for Carl&apos;s interpretation, I think if pressed you guys would find<br/>that you agree more than you think you do. After all, it&apos;s a fairly<br/>odd experience for me, as an outsider, to watch Carl talk about<br/>rank-order matrices and tell me how everything&apos;s not about HE, and<br/>then for you to also tell me on the same thing, but then for you guys<br/>to to somehow disagree when you talk directly to one another. I don&apos;t<br/>get it.</p><p>-Mike</p></div><h3>lobawad &#x3C;lobawad@...&#x3E;</h3><span>6/13/2011 4:12:19 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, Mike Battaglia &lt;battaglia01@...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; On Mon, Jun 13, 2011 at 5:07 AM, lobawad &lt;lobawad@...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; --- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, Mike Battaglia &lt;battaglia01@&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; 1) The average person can&apos;t identify every interval in 12-EDO from &gt;one<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; another.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; The average person can&apos;t carry a tune in a bucket, or notice &quot;wrong notes&quot; or when something&apos;s &quot;off key&quot;?

Then, if I<br/>&gt; shift back to 12-equal, suddenly the 400 cent major third will sound<br/>&gt; wrong, and the 200 cent whole step as well. After a few seconds I<br/>&gt; adjust again. This seems to apply even if we&apos;re dealing with diatonic<br/>&gt; scales as diverse as 17-equal and 26-equal. Although you seem to have<br/>&gt; spent much of your time learning to distinguish between different<br/>&gt; intervals - my recent explorations into exotemperaments have led me to<br/>&gt; try and identify their similarities. So I might say that things sound<br/>&gt; similar in more ways than you might.</p><p>Oh I think peception can flip around in all kinds of ways, that&apos;s part of the fun.</p><p>Eh, gotta go.</p><p>&gt;<br/>&gt; Lastly, I should say that I&apos;m not sure how useful the grid of<br/>&gt; reference provided by the harmonic series up around the highest part<br/>&gt; of the chunk we&apos;re looking at, like 54-64 say, will be - I think I&apos;d<br/>&gt; find it very confusing if you hit random harmonics and asked me to<br/>&gt; guess which is which. But I think that where it gets ambiguous, I&apos;d<br/>&gt; just develop another coding strategy to find my way mentally around<br/>&gt; the scale; I&apos;d find some kind of undeniably familiar intervals (like<br/>&gt; 56/24, which would be 7/4) and then I&apos;d get a handle on what&apos;s going<br/>&gt; on that way. You don&apos;t need to know every single note in 31-tet to be<br/>&gt; able to find your way around it, and I don&apos;t think you&apos;d need to learn<br/>&gt; all of the harmonics from 32-64 to get the gist of how to move around<br/>&gt; the 32-note scale either.</p></div><h3>Daniel Nielsen &#x3C;nielsed@...&#x3E;</h3><span>6/13/2011 7:47:55 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Mike B:<br/>&quot;As for 400 cents and 386 cents being completely different in character<br/>- I notice that if I&apos;m playing in 12-equal, the 400 cent major third<br/>sounds &quot;right,&quot; and then a sudden shift to the 386 cent major third<br/>will sound &quot;wrong.&quot; Then, if I shift to 31-equal, and play around the<br/>circle of fifths for a bit, suddenly the 386 cent one will sound<br/>right, and the 193 cent whole step will sound right too.

I wonder how many<br/>music students begin their ear training without even understanding the<br/>harmonic sequence. In high school, our teacher would play the approximations<br/>on a piano and say, &quot;These are the notes that play when the bottom note is<br/>played&quot;. Not knowing much about wave analysis, I didn&apos;t know if he was<br/>talking about sympathetic vibration of the strings or not, nor about how the<br/>timbre was composed of its own spectrum so the statement wasn&apos;t actually<br/>true, nor that those fundamentals were actually only approximations, etc,<br/>but it seemed to make sense to everyone else. So harmony winds up mastering<br/>the player instead of being the tools of the player. Even worse, it leads an<br/>interested student right past a treasure trove of theory.

The most harmonics approximated by any EDO from 41 down is 19, in 41 itself (no surprise).  If you can tell the difference between steps of 41, you can tell the difference between the 61st and the 63rd harmonic.</p><p>And in any case, the point of the exercise is more to find ways of treating EDOs like JI, i.e. to use pitch organization techniques the JI folks use (tonality diamonds, CPS&apos;s, etc.) in the context of an EDO.  I got the idea from someone on the xenharmonic NING, I think it was Mark L. Vines but I&apos;m not sure anymore because it&apos;s been awhile.  I think he was using a lower error threshold than I am, though, because by his metric he was looking for at least 5 harmonics and 22-EDO didn&apos;t make his list, but by my count 22-EDO has about 9 harmonics within bounds.
