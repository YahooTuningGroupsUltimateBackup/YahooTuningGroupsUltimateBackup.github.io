I will, however, say that<br/>&gt;this strikes me as incredibly childish. Carl, grow up.</p><p>I didn&apos;t ask you to delete it, I just meant it&apos;s polite to<br/>ask first.</p><p>Anyone who&apos;s read my posts here over the last 6 years knows<br/>I&apos;m all about sharing information and against owning it.<br/>But, just so I can bring up Nazis, what if Nazis took and<br/>used one of your compositions as their anthem?  Wouldn&apos;t it<br/>be nice if they asked first, giving you the chance to first<br/>voice your disapproval?</p><p>When we create, we bring things into the world, and that<br/>puts us in a position of responsibility.  While I think<br/>traditional ownership of information is absurd, some sort of<br/>protocol that helps us bear the responsibility of sharing<br/>the results of our time and effort is a Good Thing.</p><p>I didn&apos;t ask Ms. Carlos or the Computer Music Journal if I<br/>could scan that graphic and publish it on the web.  I<br/>thought it was within normal academic fair use.  But maybe<br/>she wouldn&apos;t like it if it weren&apos;t reposted on yahoo.  Or,<br/>maybe she&apos;d love it.  But because I&apos;m the one who created<br/>the digital copy, I&apos;m somewhat responsible if she didn&apos;t like<br/>it.  So please, link to <a href="http://lumma.org">lumma.org</a>, don&apos;t mirror, unless you<br/>have a good reason.  This is really standard web practice.</p><p>Thanks,</p><p>-Carl</p></div><h3><a id=46193 href="#46193">ðŸ”—</a>Gene Ward Smith &#x3C;gwsmith@svpal.org&#x3E;</h3><span>8/4/2003 2:35:31 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;Carl Lumma&quot; &lt;ekin@l...&gt; wrote:</p><p>&gt; Anyone who&apos;s read my posts here over the last 6 years knows<br/>&gt; I&apos;m all about sharing information and against owning it.<br/>&gt; But, just so I can bring up Nazis, what if Nazis took and<br/>&gt; used one of your compositions as their anthem?

Any good network has some<br/>redundancy.  The problem is getting everyone to agree on anything.<br/>As you can see on tuning-math, we&apos;re still each using our own<br/>language.  It&apos;s getting better, but we&apos;re clearly not to the<br/>point where we have anything to archive.  Meanwhile, I&apos;m really<br/>glad about <a href="http://xenharmony.org">xenharmony.org</a>, and I can&apos;t wait for the wedgie expo.</p><p>-Carl</p></div>
