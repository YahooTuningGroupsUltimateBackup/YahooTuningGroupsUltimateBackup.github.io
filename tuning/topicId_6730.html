A fun example is 26, since 26-tET&apos;s major thirds<br/>are about as flat as 12-tET&apos;s are sharp. We can arrange this by setting the<br/>C-E major third to be exactly 386 cents, and having the circle of fifths<br/>progress smoothly from largest fifths (696.63 cents) adjacent to D and<br/>smallest fifths (687.99 cents) at the opposite side of the circle, using a<br/>sinusoidal function. The resulting tuning is:</p><p>Note     Cents<br/>C          0.0<br/>C#        71.4<br/>Cx=Dbb   105.0<br/>Db       128.9<br/>D        193.0<br/>D#       257.1<br/>Dx=Ebb   281.0<br/>Eb       314.6<br/>E        386.0<br/>E#       438.6<br/>Fb       458.0<br/>F        504.1<br/>F#       577.1<br/>Fx=Gbb   616.8<br/>Gb       637.7<br/>G        696.4<br/>G#       764.8<br/>Gx=Abb   793.0<br/>Ab       821.2<br/>A        889.6<br/>A#       948.3<br/>Ax=Bbb   969.2<br/>Bb      1008.9<br/>B       1081.9<br/>B#      1128.0<br/>Cb      1147.4</p><p>The usual meantone keys will sound very nice, having major thirds of about<br/>382-386 cents, except for E-G# at 379 cents (similar to the 19-tET value).<br/>On the other side of the circle of fiths, the five notes which can be named<br/>using either double-sharps or double flats form an excellent representation<br/>of the Thai pentatonic scale, with steps of 176 and 336 cents (the Thai<br/>7-tET uses 171 and 343) -- note that here the major third is 2*176=352<br/>cents. Adding B# and Fb to this collection produces a diatonic scale (Cx<br/>major or Dbb major) which is nearly equally-spaced and may approach the<br/>diatonic tunings in some Scandinavian regions (according to Parncutt). Also,<br/>due to the 26-tET behavior &quot;on average&quot;, there are many powerful 7-limit<br/>relationships across the width of the circle, e.g. the near-7:4 interval<br/>from C to Ax=Bbb. There are a few comma-like intervals to play around with<br/>too: E#-Fb and B#-Cb are each 19.4 cents</p></div>
