It is possible that Bach might have enjoyed<br/>the tuning as well as the key change in similar light!</p><p>&quot;Paul H. Erlich&quot; wrote:</p><p>&gt;  Although quantitative studies of the WTC appear to<br/>&gt; reveal that its composition was indeed informed by such a tuning, it is also<br/>&gt; known that a good number of its pieces were simply transposed from earlier<br/>&gt; works, originally in meantone or meantone-like keys of a well-temperament,<br/>&gt; into the supposedly most &quot;dissonant&quot; or Pythagorean-like keys of<br/>&gt; well-temperament.</p><p>-- Kraig Grady<br/>North American Embassy of Anaphoria Island<br/><a href="http://www.anaphoria.com">http://www.anaphoria.com</a></p></div>
