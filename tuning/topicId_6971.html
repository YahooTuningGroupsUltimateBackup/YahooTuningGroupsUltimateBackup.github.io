Temperments is necessary for harmony. That<br/>&gt; western tunings have began to appear in these cultures coincides with there<br/>&gt; use of western harmony. Both Harrison and Leedy have expressed there interest<br/>&gt; in JI is its melodic resoures. Participating with them and David Doty at a<br/>&gt; Seminar on Intonation, this seemed to be the universal connection between us<br/>&gt; all.</p><p>&gt; and<br/>&gt; &gt;that &quot;consistency of interval size ... is a feature of the best<br/>&gt; &gt;western European singers.&quot;</p><p> Once again Darreg&apos;s mustache blue concerts always included Glen Prior playing<br/>a well known simple melody with these commatic shifts using Wilson&apos;s 17 tone<br/>tubalongs.<br/>Wilson favorite pastime is pointing out commatic shifts in all types of western<br/>singers on tape. Once again Boomsliter and Creel showed this in actually<br/>measurements. Melody is dead without the ability of extended frame of<br/>reference. Here on this list we have someone examining Turkish music noticing<br/>shifts in melodic intonation.</p><p>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;This suggests that either Renaissance or 20th-century singers<br/>&gt; &gt;approaching the 16th-century repertory may in fact be doing at least<br/>&gt; &gt;some adaptive JI with tempering of melodic intervals.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; That&apos;s what I would suggest as a possible solution for not only 16th but<br/>&gt; even 17th and 18th century music on variable-pitch instruments. Though JI<br/>&gt; harmonies would be achieved, it runs counter to the  standard JI line, which<br/>&gt; goes more like this:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;While Ramos set a possible precedent with his monochord of 1482,<br/>&gt; &gt;16th-century theorists such as Fogliano and Zarlino championed the<br/>&gt; &gt;syntonic diatonic of Ptolemy with its unequal 9:8 and 10:9 whole-tones<br/>&gt; &gt;as the natural intonation for unaccompanied voices.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; and discards consistency of interval size (and forces comma shifts/drifts)<br/>&gt; to uphold an abstract mathematical ideal. Meanwhile, even Zarlino became the<br/>&gt; first champion of a mathematically precise meantone in practice, namely<br/>&gt; 2/7-comma meantone.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;Describing the common practice as &quot;tempered and mixed music,&quot; and<br/>&gt; &gt;basing the tuning of the first 19 notes of his instrument on usual<br/>&gt; &gt;meantone (likely 1/4-comma with pure major thirds), [Vicentino] directed<br/>&gt; that<br/>&gt; &gt;the 17 notes of his second manual should be tuned in perfect fifths<br/>&gt; &gt;with those of the first manual. The result, assuming a basic 1/4-comma<br/>&gt; &gt;temperament, would be sonorities with pure fifths and minor thirds, as<br/>&gt; &gt;well as major thirds, if the performer can reach the appropriate keys<br/>&gt; &gt;on both manuals simultaneously.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; This would provide all the pitches necessary for rendering most 16th-19th<br/>&gt; century music in the form of &quot;adaptive JI&quot; I&apos;ve been suggesting to John<br/>&gt; deLaubenfels. While acheiving the same harmonic purity as strict JI, this<br/>&gt; scheme would reduce the size of the shifts and drifts involved by a factor<br/>&gt; of 4, down to an imperceptible level, without substantially increasing the<br/>&gt; total number of pitches required. I independently conceived this idea of<br/>&gt; combining vertical JI and horizontal meantone in late 1993, after attending<br/>&gt; my first AFMM concert and speaking with Johnny Reinhard.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;While Vicentino&apos;s advice to singers to rely on his instrument for<br/>&gt; &gt;finding their intervals would most obviously apply to his first tuning<br/>&gt; &gt;with 31 notes arranged to divide the octave into more or less equal<br/>&gt; &gt;dieses or fifthtones (the remaining 5 notes used for adaptive JI for a<br/>&gt; &gt;few frequent sonorities), it could also apply to this second tuning.<br/>&gt; &gt;In other words, singers might have emulated this tuning to realize a<br/>&gt; &gt;kind of JI based on melodic intervals at or very close to those of<br/>&gt; &gt;1/4-comma meantone<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; So Vicentino is on record for recommending his instrument as a model for<br/>&gt; singers, but we don&apos;t know which instrument?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;From the viewpoint of practical composition, the issue of classic<br/>&gt; &gt;vs. adaptive JI for voices (or either model vs. keyboard meantone)<br/>&gt; &gt;might not have much observable impact.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I would disagree -- in those cases where the second degree of the major<br/>&gt; scale is in the upper melody and is forced to shift up by a comma because of<br/>&gt; a change in the harmony from subdominant to dominant, or else the overall<br/>&gt; pitch level is forced to shift down by a comma, classic JI is audibly a poor<br/>&gt; solution. When the shift occurs in an inner voice, I agree that it is hard<br/>&gt; to hear, though I&apos;d still prefer the sensation of melodic &quot;certainty&quot; that<br/>&gt; occurs in meantone or Vicentino&apos;s adaptive JI.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;On a personal note, I might add that while playing a keyboard in<br/>&gt; &gt;classic 5-limit JI is an exacting experience, it is also a unique one,<br/>&gt; &gt;and that I do not find unequal 9:8 and 10:9 whole-tones unpleasant. At<br/>&gt; &gt;least for some music some of the time, this experience is not only<br/>&gt; &gt;possible but most rewarding.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Certainly unequal whole-tones can be an acquired taste. When there is no<br/>&gt; harmonic progression or modulation, they can take on a melodic certainty of<br/>&gt; their own. Such a situation arises in Indian music, where the &quot;natural&quot;<br/>&gt; scale is the same as the &quot;syntonic diatonic&quot; except with the sixth degree<br/>&gt; raised by a comma. I think it significant that this &quot;alteration&quot; (it is only<br/>&gt; an alteration by Eurocentric standards) creates an upper tetrachord<br/>&gt; identical to the lower one.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;Finally, I might suggest a pragmatic study of intonation as practiced,<br/>&gt; &gt;for example, by vocal groups famed for their &quot;just&quot; tuning of<br/>&gt; &gt;16th-century music. Would we find some approximation of Zarlino&apos;s<br/>&gt; &gt;syntonic diatonic, or of a Vicentino/Erlich adaptive tuning, or<br/>&gt; &gt;something else?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Though I doubt any vocal group would be able to control their melodic<br/>&gt; intonation to much better than 10 cents, the comma shifts implied by the<br/>&gt; &quot;classic JI&quot; or &quot;syntonic diatonic&quot; tuning would amount to 21.5 cents, and<br/>&gt; their presence or absence should be clearly ascertainable by such a study.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;</p><p>-- Kraig Grady<br/>North American Embassy of Anaphoria Island<br/><a href="http://www.anaphoria.com">http://www.anaphoria.com</a></p></div><h3><a id=6972 href="#6972">ðŸ”—</a>Paul H.

I think<br/>as to what our ear actually does is not to underrated. . Some sort of moveable<br/>12 seems to be an answer.  My intuitive sense is in this culture, certain<br/>procedures have been built up over the hundreds of years. The ear may change<br/>formulas depending on the context. It may do certain things leading up to<br/>cadences, different things in major than minor, the same note when contained<br/>within a chord might have a different intonation of the same note when it is<br/>used as a passing tone or a upper neighbor. All these intonations are probably<br/>the result of centuries of cultural artistic nuance. It might someday be able<br/>to be approached by programmed by a set of if/then situations, but the intuned<br/>ear will know these things through intuition. As much as we all wish there was<br/>a simple answer to these questions , I don&apos;t think there is.  It seems to go<br/>back even tens of thousands of years, bone flutes show that we had already<br/>taken the leap into melodic steps on one level.<br/>    As someone who regularly &quot;defends&quot; JI on this list, it should be noted that<br/>I do not believe that it explains all. I  do believe that scales though  are<br/>rooted in  acoustical phenomenon of some kind. (This why i shy away from ETs).<br/>As an example of other acoustical qualities, difference tones appear to play an<br/>active part in the many world musics. Bill Sethares illustrates how other<br/>acoustical phenomenon such as timbre could/can/does have an influence on scale<br/>making. It is quite possible that all these factors have there share on<br/>influence as to what happens.</p><p>-- Kraig Grady<br/>North American Embassy of Anaphoria Island<br/><a href="http://www.anaphoria.com">http://www.anaphoria.com</a></p></div>
