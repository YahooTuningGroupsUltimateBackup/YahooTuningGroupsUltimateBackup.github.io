Leave it to your<br/>conscience, what you think about that....</p><p>I have some VRML models of 3d models on my home page VRML site:<br/><a href="http://www.rcwalker.freeserve.co.uk/interactive_models_with_titles/index.htm">http://www.rcwalker.freeserve.co.uk/interactive_models_with_titles/index.htm</a></p><p>Also anaglyphs (the 3D red / green models), and ray traced drawings, which<br/>you&apos;ll find if you look around.</p><p>(N.b. feel a bit hesitant mentioning my home page to eagle eared listeners<br/>as it has some of my recorder recordings - I can hear intervals well, but<br/>can&apos;t reproduce them so easily, not being a trained musician, and am aware<br/>my notes aren&apos;t that steady and intonation isn&apos;t so good, and rhythm not<br/>that steady, but the tunes are nice I think. I&apos;ll prob do some new<br/>recordings some time - working on TS has helped me play a little better now<br/>I think.)</p><p>I&apos;ve done a bit of study of 4D solids. 4D is interesting because there are<br/>more polytopes than in any other dimension, including 3 - after 4D there are<br/>only the generalisations of the cube, octahedron and tetrahedron.</p><p>Amazing to see you all enthusing about 4D, and found some good links from<br/>reading your postings, such as the contstruction of the 120 cell (4D equiv.<br/>of dodecahedron), and the one on uniform polyhedra in 4D<br/><a href="http://members.aol.com/Polycell/uniform.html">http://members.aol.com/Polycell/uniform.html</a>. Seems amazing to me - the 3D<br/>uniform polyhedra are complex enough! If you are interested in the 3D<br/>equivalent of these, there are some nice black and white photographs in the<br/>book by Weninger who also explains how to construct paper models of 3D<br/>solids of them, as well as simpler mathematical 3D figures and compounds.</p><p>There is a good list of VRML model sites at George Hart&apos;s Pavilion of<br/>Polhedrality.<br/><a href="http://www.georgehart.com/pavilion.html">http://www.georgehart.com/pavilion.html</a></p><p>Includes Magnus Wnninger&apos;s home page (author of the book I mentioned):<br/><a href="http://www.employees.csbsju.edu/mwenninger/">http://www.employees.csbsju.edu/mwenninger/</a></p><p>George Hart&apos;s site site has an encyclopedic listing of many mathematical<br/>models, but I think one of you have already mentioned it.</p><p>For mathematicians, a really good start is Coxeter&apos;s Introduction to<br/>Geometry - though called an &quot;introduction&quot;, it is pretty advanced (kind of<br/>math. tradition - as you get on the books often get more and more titled<br/>things like Introduction to, and less and less, things like Advanced, and<br/>Further,....)</p><p>Has a good section on 4D solids.</p><p>Sorry, don&apos;t have any suggestions about Java apart from what Carl Lumma<br/>said. Hope you get it sorted out.</p><p>I&apos;ve found Java plug ins a bit tricky at times!</p><p>Robert</p></div>
