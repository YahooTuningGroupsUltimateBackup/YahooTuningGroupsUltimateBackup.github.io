This<br/>subject might appear off-topic, but on second thought I suppose it<br/>is relevant to the Tuning List. For one, if such scales<br/>exist, don&apos;t we all want to find out their tunings? Besides<br/>that, this conjecture arises out of questions related to tuning,<br/>in more than one way.</p><p>I am afraid there is too much &quot;theory&quot; in this message. My apologies<br/>in advance. I had to mention some theory to show how it is related<br/>to tuning -- then I had to reply to Paul.</p><p>First, let me clear up a misunderstanding</p><p>&gt;&gt; (The stack of three fourths is another story.)<br/>&gt; Why?<br/>&gt; I think in that case the consonance of using a 7:3 for the outer<br/>&gt; interval is a strong motivation to use this temperament.</p><p>Good Grief, Paul (=: -- according to our own postings we are in<br/>agreement over the tuning _and_, to a remarkable degree, over the<br/>function of a stack of three fourths.<br/>I have written:<br/>: I have not found either a theoretical or an<br/>: experimental grace in (or about) 27:36:48:64, yet. I have played four<br/>: tones, varying continuously two of them; result: nothing special about<br/>: the above proportion. Actually the sonority got more &quot;interesting&quot;,<br/>: albeit more Gesualdo-like, as I contracted the total interval.<br/>: (Might it be  C-D-F = {1/8 : 1/7 : 1/6} (common overtone C) with a<br/>: drone G?)<br/>I said &quot;drone&quot; because I have not come to terms with &quot;added&quot; yet.<br/>I note that this separate tone is consonant with the root of the rest.<br/>You have written<br/>&gt; Essentially, the previous chord is 1/1:7/6:7/4. Then, holding these<br/>&gt; notes, the root moves down a &quot;fifth.&quot; The temperament is essential<br/>&gt; since it allows the 7/4 to function as a smooth suspended &quot;fourth&quot;<br/>&gt; over the new root [...]</p><p>My trouble here is that the notion &quot;function as a suspended x&quot; seems<br/>at odds with dualism. I have found examples in Common Practice that can<br/>be rationalized as suspensions, in the sense that an irrational chord<br/>can be split into two parts, the one belonging to the previous chord<br/>and the other to the next chord. Then, in scanning Gesualdo and some<br/>similar music I got into trouble (I was looking for it, it seems)<br/>because I found irrational chords that could not be rationalized in<br/>the above way. Perhaps I am ripe for a paradigm shift.</p><p>I have not managed to listen to your TIBIA yet (hey, Greeks: he means<br/>&quot;AULOS&quot;) but it sounds interesting altready. Next, I focus on a<br/>remark you have made about what defines the root of a chord.<br/>I am taking it not in its context but as implying a general conjecture,<br/>that direct acoustical considerations are predominant in the<br/>perception of music, instead of allowing a cognitive representation to<br/>have the last word, say, on what is the root of a chord:</p><p>&gt; By emphasizing the low bass note, I&apos;m clearly implying a normal,<br/>&gt; otonal root, rather than a high-pitched common overtone which would<br/>&gt; be the utonal &quot;root&quot;.</p><p>On the other hand, I do resort to inversional invariance when only<br/>with inversions we can arrive at harmonic functions that fit dualism.<br/>Not that I do not find direct acoustical clues very effective<br/>sometimes! For example, the effect of a minor third on the piano<br/>seems very different in the higher range than in the lower range.<br/>In the first case it sounds like an incomplete major triad, but in<br/>the second case it sounds like the lower part of a minor chord (and<br/>it seems to me like it should be turned into its inverse, the major<br/>sixth). Yet, since I focus on dualism, such clues can at most clear<br/>any inherent ambiguity in my harmonic analysis, not determinine<br/>harmonic functions by themselves.</p><p>In other words, I assume the existence of some cognitive &quot;plane&quot;<br/>at which the tones are reperesented as pitches on a cyclical<br/>8ve, and on which the &quot;root&quot; is decided. (This assumption is<br/>unavoidable if one assumes inversion invariance; however,<br/>it might not apply to all kinds of music.) Now it is time to ask<br/>whether that interpretation would be continuous or discrete<br/>(categorical). At this early time I cannot exclude either alternative.<br/>It is like comparing a digital with an analog computer.</p><p>The case of a discrete cognitive scale is tricky. So far I have<br/>employed only a 12-ET scale (I am ashamed to admit). For example,<br/>if C is in a chord, the representation of its significant<br/>overtones would be (assuming &quot;small numbers&quot; 3,5,7,9,15, and 17):<br/>{C, G, E, Bb/A#, D, B, Db/C#}, and the process of finding the<br/>&quot;lowest&quot; common overtone of the chord would be reduced to a simple<br/>comparison. Similarly, the process of checking for fundamental bass<br/>would be reduced to comparing lists of undertones, like<br/>{C, F, Ab/G#, D/Ebb, A#/Bb, Db/C#, B}.</p><p>If I repeat the same procedure in meantone (say, 19-ET) I sometimes<br/>find awkward intervals between successive &quot;roots&quot;. Assuming some<br/>temperament at this point is not a simple matter, because these<br/>roots are already discretized; one would need to assume a<br/>separate cognitive plane to represent roots in a coarser scale.<br/>Therefore I have retreated to exclusive 12-ET for the time, but I<br/>want to revisit the issue before long.</p><p>The next quote was near the previous one.</p><p>&gt;&gt; Your theory may not allow this interpretation but believe me, as a<br/>&gt;&gt; musician I know it is real.</p><p>Of course I take your word seriously and I am deeply obliged. On the<br/>other hand, we all know the sun rises every morning but the verdict of<br/>millions did not hold Copernicus back (hey, Greeks: I meant Pythagoras,<br/>but let us not confuse them now.) Assuming &quot;my&quot; theory does not<br/>contradict your _practice_ (this is still an open issue in the<br/>case of three stacked fourths) then all is well. Perhaps most people<br/>think of music theory as mainly history, but to me theory means<br/>coming up with new suggestions to be tested.</p><p>&gt; [...]  the seventh approaching a 7:4 [...]<br/>&gt; despite the apparent contradiction<br/>&gt; that the fourths, still heard as 4:3s, would mathematically imply a<br/>&gt; 16:9 seventh.</p><p>I understand you like this:<br/>If we could assume that this temperament was adopted in the cognitive<br/>plane, a fourth would be defined as an interval of so many steps rather<br/>than the ratio 4:3, therefore there would be no contradiction.</p><p>I just wanted to emphasize the authority of such a process after it<br/>has started running.</p><p>Good day!<br/>- George Kahrimanis      <a href="mailto:anakreon@hol.gr">anakreon@hol.gr</a></p></div>
