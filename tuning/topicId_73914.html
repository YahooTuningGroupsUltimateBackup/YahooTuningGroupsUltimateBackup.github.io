There was no reason for him, or his readers,<br/>to know or care about details of keyboard tuning, such as varieties of<br/>meantone. (Still, he did know about &apos;split sharps&apos;.)<br/>He first said that the tone is divided into nine, almost inaudible,<br/>equal parts called &apos;commas&apos;, of which the large semitone is 5 and the<br/>small one 4. [This is an ancient idea going back to medieval<br/>Pythagorean intonation, which seems to have been passed on<br/>uncritically through the generations.] Tosi then says that some people<br/>think the tone is only made up of 7 parts. But he, relying on his<br/>admittedly poor understanding, preferred to count 9, because he thinks<br/>the ear could easily distinguish 1/7 of a tone, but would have much<br/>more difficulty with 1/9 tone.</p><p>Duffin has only:<br/>&quot;A whole tone is divided into nine almost imperceptible intervals<br/>which are called commas, five of which constitute the major semitone,<br/>and four the minor semitone...&quot;</p><p>Thi omits how Tosi doesn&apos;t understand the function of a comma, how<br/>Tosi is uncertain about how many commas there are in a tone, and how<br/>he prefers 9 to 7 on grounds which are highly subjective or nonsensical.<br/>Then Duffin uses Tosi as one of his major sources to &apos;deduce&apos; that<br/>18th century vocal and instrumental intonation should be 1/6 comma<br/>meantone - a tuning which could only be practiced on keyboard<br/>instruments!</p><p>His source is a singer who says that a comma is the smallest interval<br/>that can possibly be distinguished - and then Duffin uses it to<br/>&apos;prove&apos; the use of a temperament which divides this comma into six!</p><p>Tosi relates intonation to the form of accompanying instrumentation:<br/>he says that the difference between &apos;major&apos; and &apos;minor&apos; semitones is<br/>not evident on the organ or harpsichord, if they do not have split<br/>keys. (Split key instruments were, though, probably tuned in<br/>quarter-comma meantone...)</p><p>After plumping for dividing the tone into 9, he says that if one is<br/>accompanied by keyboard instruments without split keys it is<br/>useless to know about &apos;major&apos; and &apos;minor&apos; semitones. But because<br/>composers like to introduce arias with only (bowed) string instrument<br/>accompaniment, one must know that D# is lower than Eb.</p><p>As we know, 1/6 comma meantone is a tuning for keyboards with fixed<br/>pitches; yet Tosi only requires the singer to differentiate between D#<br/>and Eb when accompanied by strings without keyboard. In that case<br/>there would be no reason for any of the performers to adopt a meantone<br/>tuning. Duffin claims to &apos;deduce&apos; a keyboard-based tuning from what<br/>Tosi said about musical performances without keyboard accompaniment.</p><p>The practical problem, as with all these alleged multiple divisions of<br/>the tone for singers and instrumentalists, is that the sizes of<br/>semitones are very hard to identify accurately by ear, and<br/>particularly in harmonic progressions. 80 and 120 cents can both be<br/>perfectly acceptable semitones in appropriate musical contexts. How<br/>could one possibly know by listening if one had played a &apos;correctly&apos;<br/>uneven chromatic scale? How could one learn the 9-fold division at all<br/>accurately? It is, and was, totally impractical to ask violinists or<br/>singers to produce sizes of semitone according to a mathematical formula.</p><p>(If anyone doubts this, let them try to tune a harpsichord by<br/>listening to tones and semitones alone!)</p><p>What is not impractical is to ask for *harmonic* intervals to be pure,<br/>or not too far from pure. A singer can easily recognise if her Eb is<br/>too low or her D# too high simply by listening to the chord; there is<br/>no need to worry about the exact size of tones or semitones in themselves.</p><p>The semitone is a dissonance which is the difference between two<br/>consonant harmonic intervals. To teach intonation by starting with the<br/>semitone is putting the cart before the horse. Yet that is what the<br/>scholars (Haynes, Duffin, Lehman...) seem to think Tosi and Leopold<br/>Mozart wanted.<br/>The practical truth is the reverse: if one can tune the harmonic<br/>consonances well, the semitones come of their own accord. That is what<br/>happens in keyboard tuning and in non-keyboard performance. People who<br/>talked about dividing the tone into so and so parts, or the exact size<br/>of difference between major and minor semitones, were, from first to<br/>last, engaging in theoretical speculation without any useful<br/>application to music-making.</p><p>~~~T~~~</p></div><h3><a id=73915 href="#73915">ðŸ”—</a>monz &#x3C;monz@tonalsoft.com&#x3E;</h3><span>10/16/2007 9:39:50 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Hi Tom and Leonardo,</p><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;Tom Dent&quot; &lt;stringph@...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I now realise that my expose of the falsely precise<br/>&gt; scholarship based on Tosi was made in the clavichord<br/>&gt; group.

More below ...</p><p>&gt; He first said that the tone is divided into nine,<br/>&gt; almost inaudible, equal parts called &apos;commas&apos;, of<br/>&gt; which the large semitone is 5 and the small one 4.<br/>&gt; [This is an ancient idea going back to medieval<br/>&gt; Pythagorean intonation, which seems to have been passed<br/>&gt; on uncritically through the generations.]</p><p>Indeed.</p><p>The earliest music-theoretical writing which could<br/>form a basis for it is the surviving fragments<br/>from Philolaus of c.400 BC:</p><p><a href="http://tonalsoft.com/enc/p/philolaus.aspx">http://tonalsoft.com/enc/p/philolaus.aspx</a></p><p>(Also see my fuller treatment, published in<br/>_Xenharmonikon_ 18.)</p><p>Philolaus&apos;s small divisions have the whole-tone of<br/>9:8 ratio divided into 4 &quot;diaschismata&quot; and 1 &quot;comma&quot;,<br/>and the diaschisma is approximately twice the size<br/>of the comma, thus the 9-fold division.</p><p>It may be that this division is as old as Sumerian<br/>music theory c.2500 BC, but i haven&apos;t yet found<br/>numerical/mathematical corroboration in the Sumerian<br/>or Babylonian texts.</p><p>&gt; Tosi then says that some people think the tone is<br/>&gt; only made up of 7 parts.</p><p>It very well may be that Tosi is here referring to<br/>Sauveur&apos;s recent writings on _merides_, 43-edo, and<br/>1/5-comma meantone. These tunings divide the whole-tone<br/>into 7 equal or nearly-equal parts, respectively.</p><p>&gt; But he, relying on his admittedly poor understanding,<br/>&gt; preferred to count 9, because he thinks the ear could<br/>&gt; easily distinguish 1/7 of a tone, but would have much<br/>&gt; more difficulty with 1/9 tone.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Duffin has only:<br/>&gt; &quot;A whole tone is divided into nine almost imperceptible<br/>&gt; intervals which are called commas, five of which constitute<br/>&gt; the major semitone, and four the minor semitone...&quot;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Thi omits how Tosi doesn&apos;t understand the function of a<br/>&gt; comma, how Tosi is uncertain about how many commas there<br/>&gt; are in a tone, and how he prefers 9 to 7 on grounds which<br/>&gt; are highly subjective or nonsensical. Then Duffin uses Tosi<br/>&gt; as one of his major sources to &apos;deduce&apos; that 18th century<br/>&gt; vocal and instrumental intonation should be 1/6 comma<br/>&gt; meantone - a tuning which could only be practiced on<br/>&gt; keyboard instruments!<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; His source is a singer who says that a comma is the<br/>&gt; smallest interval that can possibly be distinguished<br/>&gt; - and then Duffin uses it to &apos;prove&apos; the use of a<br/>&gt; temperament which divides this comma into six!</p><p>Hmm, that all does sound like shoddy scholarship to me.</p><p>&gt; Tosi relates intonation to the form of accompanying<br/>&gt; instrumentation: he says that the difference between<br/>&gt; &apos;major&apos; and &apos;minor&apos; semitones is not evident on the<br/>&gt; organ or harpsichord, if they do not have split keys.<br/>&gt; (Split key instruments were, though, probably tuned in<br/>&gt; quarter-comma meantone...)<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; After plumping for dividing the tone into 9, he says<br/>&gt; that if one is accompanied by keyboard instruments<br/>&gt; without split keys it is useless to know about &apos;major&apos;<br/>&gt; and &apos;minor&apos; semitones.

In that case there would be no reason<br/>&gt; for any of the performers to adopt a meantone tuning.<br/>&gt; Duffin claims to &apos;deduce&apos; a keyboard-based tuning from<br/>&gt; what Tosi said about musical performances without keyboard<br/>&gt; accompaniment.</p><p>Just playing devil&apos;s advocate here, it is true that D# is<br/>lower than Eb in all tunings of the meantone family<br/>(except 12-edo).</p><p>But i agree with your subsequent arguments (which i<br/>snipped here). Tosi, in speaking of singing accompanied<br/>only by bowed strings, would (i think) almost certainly<br/>be referring to some form of JI or adaptive-JI.</p><p>Of course, in JI, D# may be higher or lower than Eb,<br/>depending on which ratio was either specified by the<br/>composer or, if not specified, which ratio fits the<br/>harmonic context best ... and of course, that &quot;best&quot;<br/>introduces a subjective opinion ...</p><p>-monz<br/><a href="http://tonalsoft.com">http://tonalsoft.com</a><br/>Tonescape microtonal music software</p></div><h3><a id=73918 href="#73918">ðŸ”—</a>Tom Dent &#x3C;stringph@gmail.com&#x3E;</h3><span>10/16/2007 12:24:00 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Actually, I totally agree with Tosi, to the extent that D# is probably<br/>lower than Eb in all relevant musical contexts (i.e. strings playing<br/>common practice harmony without enharmonic shifts). Suppose a piece in<br/>G major. G and D are open strings tuned (practically) pure, serving as<br/>reference. B becomes probably close to a pure third above G. D#<br/>modulates into E minor via a third above B (eg melody G-C-B-C#-D#-E),<br/>which is unlikely to be very much wider than pure. After a return to<br/>the tonic, there is a brief modulation to G minor and the melody goes,<br/>say, G-F-Eb-D over a bass G. Here the third G-Eb is also unlikely to<br/>be much wider than pure, and Eb turns out probably quite a lot higher<br/>than D#. The exact extent to which this happens will depend on a dozen<br/>unquantifiable factors. (Here, D# and Eb were approached by tones:<br/>their exact tuning depends on how large one makes the tones, not the<br/>semitones!)</p><p>One can call the difference &apos;a comma&apos; and be quite correct, if one<br/>defines the &apos;comma&apos; as a small and barely noticeable difference in<br/>pitch. That is the level on which Tosi makes perfect sense, since he<br/>did not give a definition that a reader could make quantitative use<br/>of. (1/9 tone, but *which* tone, and how to divide it?)</p><p>And I totally agree that this excess of Eb over D# also happens in all<br/>relevant historical meantone tunings, including those that string<br/>players and singers were probably used to hearing from organs, etc.<br/>However, I think it is extremely unlikely that such &apos;commas&apos; in vocal<br/>or non-keyboard performances were at all consistent between different<br/>performers (I mean on different occasions) - let alone that anyone had<br/>ever measured them accurately.</p><p>No singer is likely to remember the exact pitch D# from the first<br/>passage and try to reproduce it as Eb in the second - let alone to try<br/>and sharpen it by one-N&apos;th of a tone. The advice that Eb is higher<br/>than D# by one-N&apos;th-tone might be true enough, but practically not<br/>useful, since to sing in tune one has to learn pure fifths, thirds,<br/>fourths etc. The purity of these consonances (in relation to the<br/>accompaniment) is always a better guide than trying to control the<br/>sizes of tones and semitones without regard to other voices.</p><p>Another possibility is that Tosi was mentioning this enharmonic<br/>difference to show off his knowledge and subtlety. It &apos;proves&apos; that he<br/>must be a good teacher because he can detect things as small as a<br/>nineth of a tone... whereas those ignorant modern singers can&apos;t tell<br/>any difference. (Tosi doesn&apos;t suspect that keyboard tuners could<br/>detect a fortieth of a tone!)</p><p>Consider this passage:</p><p> &apos;Proccuri il Maestro, che nel solfeggiar la Scaletta le note sieno<br/>dallo Scolaro perfettamente intonate. Chi non ha delicatezza d&apos;<br/>orecchio non dovrebbe impegnarsi, n&egrave; d&apos; insegnar, n&egrave; di cantare, non<br/>essendo assolutamente tollerabile il difetto d&apos; una voce, che cresce,<br/>e cala come il flusso, e il riflusso del Mare. Vi rifletta con tutta<br/>l&apos; attenzione l&apos; Istruttore, perch&egrave; ogni Cantante, che stuona perde<br/>immediatamente tutte le pi&ugrave; belle prerogative, che avesse. Io posso<br/>dir senza mentire, che (a riserva di pochi Professori) la moderna<br/>intonazione &egrave; assai cattiva.&apos;</p><p>The master should get the student to sing the scale with the notes<br/>perfectly tuned. Whoever does not have a sensitive ear should not<br/>either teach or sing, a voice which rises and falls like the ebb and<br/>flow of the sea being absolutely intolerable. The instructor should<br/>turn all his attention to it, because every singer who mistunes<br/>immediately loses all the good repute that (he or she) had. I can say<br/>honestly that, apart from a few professors, modern intonation is quite<br/>bad.</p><p>Two more interesting quotations:</p><p> &apos;Il quarto &egrave; il Trillo cresciuto, che insegnasi col far ascendere<br/>impercettibilmente la voce trillando di Coma in Coma senza che si<br/>conosca l&apos; aumento.</p><p> &apos;Il quinto &egrave; il Trillo calato, che consiste nel far discendere<br/>insensibilmente la voce a Coma per Coma col Trillo in forma che [-27-]<br/>non si distingua il declivo. Questi due Trilli da che s&apos; introdusse il<br/>vero buon gusto non sono pi&ugrave; in voga, anzi bisogna scordarsi di<br/>saperli fare. Chi ha l&apos; orecchio dilicato egualmente abborre le<br/>seccaggini antiche, e gli abusi moderni.&apos;</p><p>i.e. trills ascending or descending imperceptibly by commas (!) which<br/>Tosi says are no longer in fashion.</p><p>Also, in the &apos;appoggiatura&apos; section:</p><p> &apos;La Teorica insegna, che la suddetta Ottava essendo composta di<br/>dodici Semituoni ineguali bisogna distinguere i maggiori da i minori,<br/>e invia chi studia a consultare i Tetracordi. Gli Autori pi&ugrave; cospicui,<br/>che ne trattano non son tutti d&apos; una opinione, perch&egrave; trovasi chi<br/>sostiene, che fra il C sol fa ut, e il D la sol re, come fra &apos;l F fa<br/>ut, e il G sol re ut i loro Semituoni sieno eguali, e in tanto si<br/>languisce nel dubbio.&apos;</p><p>Theory teaches that this octave is composed of twelve unequal<br/>semitones, the major being distinguished from the minor, and sends<br/>whoever is studying to consult the Tetrachords. The most famous<br/>authors who consider it are not all of one opinion, since some are<br/>found who hold that between C and D, as between F and G, the semitones<br/>are equal, such that [the matter] languishes in doubt.</p><p>... This would, if taken seriously, indicate a scheme which is not<br/>meantone at all! For example this could be a somewhat sloppy reference<br/>to JI in which C-D and F-G are major tones divided up as 135/128 and<br/>16/15, the difference being too small to care about, whereas D-E and<br/>G-A were divided as 25/24 plus 16/15.</p><p>Tosi then casts aside the theory and throws himself on the naked ear...</p><p> &apos;Ma se ha quel transito libero di mezza voce ascendendo, da che<br/>procede, che dall&apos; istesso Fa non pu&ograve; [-22-] salire al Diesis vicino,<br/>che pur il passo &egrave; di un Semituono?

And we forbid these<br/>semitones in making appoggiaturas, simply because we are guided by the<br/>judgement of whoever is listening. A reasonable, but not logical or<br/>useful explanation, whose relevance to tuning is highly debatable.<br/>Tosi now finds the difference between major and minor semitones<br/>obvious to the ear. But this is probably due to their musical context<br/>(within a given tonality) rather than a tiny difference in interval sizes.</p><p>It always remains unclear *how* the teacher should judge whether the<br/>pupil is exactly in tune or not. Unlike, say, Ramos, Tosi never<br/>specifies any particular scale or interval. In the end he just says<br/>you gotta have good ears.

In the<br/>system Tosi was describing in this book, there aren&apos;t two or more<br/>different sizes of tone.  There&apos;s only the 9-comma tone.  The diatonic<br/>scales are made up of five of these 9-comma tones, and two 5-comma<br/>semitones.</p><p>And Tosi described not only that 9-comma tone, but also pointed out<br/>(correctly) that a sharped note and the enharmonic flat (such as D# vs<br/>Eb) are one comma apart from one another.  Tosi explained carefully,<br/>especially in the section of his book about properly improvised<br/>ornamentation, that a singer dare not use the wrong enharmonic in<br/>passing within an ornament.  That is, the singer&apos;s supposed to sing<br/>the correctly-spelled notes, and to be sensitive to these commatic<br/>differences, employing notes that belong to the prevailing diatonic<br/>scale of a passage rather than bringing in chromatic notes (off by a<br/>comma) from outside the diatonic scale.</p><p>Tosi was writing near the end of a 50-year career of teaching and<br/>performing.

Actually, there is no reason to believe that he<br/>intended to explain or refer to any &apos;system&apos; of tuning at all. The<br/>text is also not intended to teach the basics of musical theory:</p><p> &apos;Non parler&ograve; della cognizione delle note, del loro valore, della<br/>battuta, dello spartire, d&egrave; tempi, delle pause, degli accidenti, n&eacute;<br/>d&apos;altri principj triviali; perch&eacute; sono generalmente noti.&apos;</p><p>He assumes that people already know their scales, etc. etc.</p><p>What he did say was<br/>1) it is important to sing in tune<br/>2) most singers are bad at this<br/>3) you have to have a sensitive ear<br/>4) his own ear is so good that he can tell the difference between D#<br/>and Eb, even though this is only a nineth of a tone, or maybe a<br/>seventh, depending on which theorists you read, anyway there really is<br/>a difference, even though it&apos;s only a little tiny one, and if you&apos;re<br/>not convinced you can read books about it and ask the best violinists.<br/>5) But on keyboard instruments which don&apos;t have divided sharps you<br/>can&apos;t hear the difference so it is not necessary to bother when<br/>accompanied by these.</p><p>And on those appoggiaturas:<br/>6) You should sing appoggiaturas with diatonic semitones rather than<br/>chromatic ones. Chromatic ones are smaller, at least that is what most<br/>of the theorists say, except for some of them who say that the tones<br/>C-D and F-G are divided into two equal semitones, but anyway when you<br/>sing the semitone you should be able to hear immediately if it is<br/>large or small, and the ear is the final judge of this question.</p><p>In other words his &apos;definition&apos; of large and small semitones is<br/>circular. You should make E-F large and F-F# small, because the one is<br/>a large semitone and the other a small one; the reason why, is that<br/>E-F sounds large when you sing it and F-F# sounds small.</p><p>What information about tuning one can glean is purely circumstantial -<br/>and, when one looks at the text as a whole, also vague and apparently<br/>contradictory.</p><p>He never once refers to the actual size of any musical interval, let<br/>alone how to realize it in practice.</p><p>He never once gives any objective rule as to how fifths, thirds, etc.<br/>etc. should be tuned.</p><p>He never says that whole tones, or fifths, or thirds (etc. etc.)<br/>should be the same size as each other. That would be rather important<br/>if he had been trying to communicate something about a meantone system.</p><p>He never contemplates dividing a comma into parts, as would be<br/>necessary to produce meantone; indeed according to his definition (the<br/>smallest possible part) this would produce something inaudible.</p><p>It is worth noting that all JI and Pythagorean schemes also have<br/>unequal semitones!

We did a sonata by Telemann in A<br/>minor, melody and continuo, and it happened to fit exactly into<br/>Bb-F-...-G#-D#.  So, I tuned that way in regular 1/6 comma and leaving<br/>a wolf at D#-Bb.

The harpsichord&apos;s resonance did what it&apos;s<br/>supposed to do, as to establishing nicely solid and present major and<br/>minor chords in all the keys that came up.  The pure tritones were an<br/>added attraction, coming up as they do in 7th-chords and diminished<br/>triads.

The 9-comma tone.</p><p>So, define a tone by the fact that it contains 9 commas, and then<br/>define the comma as being a 9th part of the tone. (Not to censor the<br/>reality of Tosi&apos;s description, 9 might also be 7.) That is empty, it<br/>doesn&apos;t tell the reader what size a tone or comma should be in the<br/>first place. Pythagorean tones, the easiest to tune, are made up of<br/>about 9 Pythagorean commas too...</p><p>&gt; &gt; The diatonic<br/>&gt; &gt; scales are made up of five of these 9-comma tones, and two 5-comma<br/>&gt; &gt; semitones.</p><p>One can make a nice arithmetic sum and get the number 55 - *if* you<br/>assume that every comma is an identical mathematical quantity, and<br/>that every tone is alike, and the two remaining semitones are the same<br/>as the &apos;larger&apos; semitones that divide the five tones. But there is no<br/>reason to believe Tosi ever did this arithmetic. (Why would he need<br/>to, if he trusted his ears more than his theory books?)</p><p>Even if he had, it would not have helped him or his readers, since<br/>none of them could tell what x/55 of an octave should sound like. Let<br/>alone that, by a stretch of mathematical implication, fifths should<br/>then be sounded barely flat, major thirds sharper, and minor thirds<br/>yet flatter. (None of which is necessary anyway if you don&apos;t have a<br/>keyboard accompaniment.)</p><p>I am certainly not attacking Tosi as musician. A lack of knowledge of<br/>meantone temperament would NOT have been a handicap for a singer or<br/>teacher. It is simply necessary to listen to the purity of<br/>consonances, and to keyboard instruments which have been carefully<br/>tuned. The singer&apos;s ear does the job itself much better than any formula.</p><p>So, anyone who doesn&apos;t have enough insight into the mechanics of<br/>regular tempered scales (to the extent of being able to &apos;deduce&apos; a<br/>9-comma tone into a sixth-comma meantone) can&apos;t be a good practical<br/>musician? If we believe Brad, every competent musician in history was<br/>a temperament fanatic like him.</p><p>Ignorance of &apos;correct&apos; tuning theory, and the inability to define a<br/>comma, have not been a problem for thousands of excellent singers<br/>today. They know how to sing in tune, they just don&apos;t know how to<br/>describe it mathematically or verbally. And why should they?</p><p>Tuning theorists are at a loss to describe how choirs *really* sing<br/>and how string quartets *really* play. We have some mathematical<br/>models which are probably a reasonable approximation in some cases. So<br/>what would an experienced singer do with one or more semi-accurate<br/>mathematical models? - Throw his hands up and rely on his sense of<br/>hearing. Tosi starts and ends the discussions of tuning and semitones<br/>by saying: the sensitive ear is the judge of everything. But he<br/>couldn&apos;t, and didn&apos;t attempt to, describe exactly what he heard. That<br/>is no failing on his part - simply the reality of complex, real,<br/>un-mathematically-tidy musical performance.</p><p>&gt; &gt; a method of understanding diatonic<br/>&gt; &gt; scales (and intonation) stretching back into the 17th century.</p><p>Musicians back at least to the 15th century understood the diatonic<br/>scale with chromatic inflections, and the difference between diatonic<br/>and chromatic semitones. But I don&apos;t see where anyone showed that this<br/>distinction meant anything definite for the tuning of consonances in<br/>vocal or orchestral performance. The unequal division of C-C#-D into<br/>small and large semitone is equally true for Pythagorean tuning (with<br/>C# tuned as Db) as for meantone. In the Pythagorean era, E-F and B-C<br/>were *small* semitones - making, if one cares to do the arithmetic, 53<br/>divisions in an octave.</p><p>When exactly did theory catch up with meantone practice? Perhaps with<br/>Huygens&apos; 31-division and Rossi&apos;s compendium of meantones (didn&apos;t<br/>include 1/6 comma and 55-equal!). But most music theorists ignored<br/>Rossi and Huygens anyway.</p><p>What *does* tell us about tuning in practice is texts which say<br/>whether the consonances (third, fifth, etc) should be sharp, flat or<br/>pure. Something immediately audible. Lo and behold, most such texts in<br/>the 17th century ask for pure major thirds, and the keyboard<br/>instruments with their extra notes obligingly allow us to hear as many<br/>of them as possible.</p><p>*No* known 17th century text explains or encourages the use of<br/>1/6-comma...</p><p>&gt; &gt; Practical musicianship.  Why is it so hard to believe that Tosi really<br/>&gt; &gt; did know what he was talking/writing about?</p><p>Non Sequitur. (And what is musicianship if not practical?) Musicality<br/>and correct statements about tuning theory are, practically,<br/>uncorrelated. Dom Bedos was the best French 18th century writer on<br/>organbuilding, his account of tuning theory is an absurd muddle, but<br/>he then tells you perfectly clearly how to tune (quarter comma)<br/>meantone. Most excellent musicians today couldn&apos;t begin to tell you<br/>what a comma or a meantone temperament was, unless you gave them a<br/>copy of Grove. Even then they couldn&apos;t tell you what fraction of a<br/>comma flat or sharp they make such and such an interval in a melody.<br/>They just l i s t e n.</p><p>Let&apos;s boil this down. If Tosi understood what 1/6 comma meantone was -<br/>a system in which fifths are slightly flat and major thirds are<br/>slightly more sharp - and thought it to be important - if! - why<br/>didn&apos;t he explain it?</p><p>If he (by assumption) was relying on a previous tradition of 1/6 comma<br/>meantone, why have all the historical explanations of how singers and<br/>instrumentalists could use this particular system in practice simply<br/>vanished?</p><p>~~~T~~~</p></div><h3><a id=73948 href="#73948">ðŸ”—</a>Brad Lehman &#x3C;bpl@umich.edu&#x3E;</h3><span>10/18/2007 2:42:17 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>&quot;Slipshod musicology&quot;?

It can&apos;t answer that question on written<br/>evidence, one way OR the other.</p><p>Some houses have mice, whether or not there is a cat on duty to reveal<br/>their presence.  Even if a house does have one or several well-fit<br/>cats on duty, they still might not know about all the present mice.<br/>It&apos;s not a perfect system.  Some things may have existed, even if<br/>nobody troubled to write them down.  We can&apos;t know for sure, by the<br/>method of examining ONLY such writings, the existence OR the<br/>non-existence.  There is no written evidence (at least that I know of)<br/>that anybody in the 17th century in Europe ever cut themselves a<br/>couple thinnish slices of softish bread, stuck something tasty in<br/>between, and had themselves a &quot;sandwich&quot;.  The name &quot;sandwich&quot; didn&apos;t<br/>exist, as such, describing such a mini-meal.  Does this constitute<br/>absolute proof that nobody ever ate one before the idea or the name<br/>got canonized?  Positivism can&apos;t answer such a question, either yea or<br/>nay, for sandwiches.</p><p>And meanwhile, the *practical* type of musicology, i.e. actually<br/>examining and listening to extant music, and trying it out with<br/>various plausible tuning schemes that people *could* have known about<br/>(even if they didn&apos;t write it down in modern scientific language)...it<br/>may be able to offer us clues into questions such as this, which<br/>positivism cannot answer.</p><p>To me, and maybe I&apos;m just an oddball, musicology CAN NEVER wholly<br/>divorce itself from hands-on practice as to know what&apos;s plausible, or<br/>even what&apos;s possible.  The positivistic angle of musicology HAS in the<br/>20th century gone in that direction, on and off, as we all know.  What<br/>about those of us who fancy some questions that that style of inquiry<br/>cannot answer, either one way or the other?  I&apos;m a performing<br/>musician.  I have to make firm decisions every time I prepare any<br/>performance, even if positivistic musicology (for all its other<br/>strengths) simply cannot tell me everything I would need to know to<br/>give a convincing interpretation of music.  Given 5 to 240 minutes of<br/>music to be played on some given occasion, I have to find a way to set<br/>up the instrument to make plausible results, both historically and<br/>musically, for the people who show up to hear it.  Even if it&apos;s a<br/>program of all 17th century music, it&apos;s pretty unlikely that anybody&apos;s<br/>rigid scheme of 1/4 comma meantone ONLY (nothing else allowed, because<br/>the evidence for anything else is insufficient!!) is going to do.<br/>Positivistic musicology, at least when applied in that way, condemns<br/>to mediocrity some of the music it&apos;s trying to reveal solutions for.</p><p>I have a virginal at home (among other stringed keyboard instruments),<br/>and I keep it in regular 1/5 comma most of the time BECAUSE IT SOUNDS<br/>BEST THAT WAY to me, the owner, playing the repertoire to which it&apos;s<br/>best suited: 16th-17th C along with the tonal improvisations I enjoy<br/>creating.  For its tone quality, if the 5ths are any narrower than<br/>that (to suit the allegedly &quot;better&quot; major 3rds of 1/4 comma), they<br/>just get too nasty; admittedly an aesthetic decision, a musical<br/>opinion.  I know we&apos;re in a completely different culture now from the<br/>guys 300-400 years ago, but I have to believe (at least on faith) that<br/>some of them with musical ability *also* probably made some similar<br/>choices toward sharpened major 3rds of some degree.  Another of my<br/>harpsichords sounds best (at least to me) left in regular 1/6 most of<br/>the time, and its 5ths/4ths stand out as jarringly ugly any tighter<br/>than that.  These instruments themselves, the musical sound, tell me<br/>things I can&apos;t find in books of positivistic musicology.  If I cut off<br/>such sources of understanding, from myself, I&apos;d be less than half a<br/>musician.</p><p>As for Rush Limbaugh, I have never once listened to even one of his<br/>broadcasts.

THE point is you<br/>&gt; stating that Tosi WAS talking about THE system of 9 commas per tone<br/>&gt; with 4 tones of 9 each and 2 semitones of 5 each, which adds up to a<br/>&gt; 55 comma octave. When you state that &quot;this is the system Tosi was<br/>&gt; talking about&quot; without any evidence whatsoever, it&apos;s just slipshod<br/>&gt; musicology. Lord knows we&apos;ve had more than enough of that already.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; I<br/>&gt; &gt; have no trouble believing that Tosi really knew what he was talking<br/>&gt; &gt; about, and was indeed reporting the way he sang and taught with<br/>&gt; &gt; common-practice accompaniment, whether that was keyboard-based or<br/>&gt; &gt; ensemble-based or both.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I also have no trouble believing that Tosi knew what he was talking<br/>&gt; about. I just have a lot of trouble believing your interpretation of<br/>&gt; Tosi.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; No, Tosi&apos;s report isn&apos;t any incontrovertible evidence that people<br/>&gt; &gt; *were* doing things resembling regular 1/6 comma, on keyboards or<br/>&gt; &gt; otherwise, in this common practice.  There are additional<br/>&gt; &gt; possibilities.  But it&apos;s better than outright contrary assumptions<br/>&gt; &gt; (i.e. that they were doing something radically different from 1/6 C,<br/>&gt; &gt; and that Tosi was teaching the 9-comma stuff *despite* the things good<br/>&gt; &gt; ensembles and good keyboard players were doing in everyday practice).<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; It&apos;s only contrary when one insists on the rigid interpretation that a<br/>&gt; conceptual division of the tone into 9 parts means a 55-comma octave,<br/>&gt; like you did. Personally, I have no trouble believing Tosi&apos;s 9-comma<br/>&gt; tone in combination with pure thirds and fifths as recommended by the<br/>&gt; other guys. I don&apos;t see why there has to be a conflict. It&apos;s just<br/>&gt; proportional, Brad. It&apos;s just a rule of thumb. Use it to chop up any<br/>&gt; tone of any size into two semitones.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; As for Ross Duffin&apos;s published recommendation from all this, from Tosi<br/>&gt; &gt; and Telemann and the Mozarts et al, why not just try it out?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Because I&apos;m not interested in &quot;just trying it out&quot;. I&apos;m interested in<br/>&gt; what can be gleaned from the sources without jumping to conclusions.<br/>&gt; Sure, eventually we have to do something when we play music, but thats<br/>&gt; another ball of wax. It&apos;s about musicology, Brad, which is supposed to<br/>&gt; be based on objectivity, not what you like or what you THINK &quot;works&quot;.<br/>&gt; It&apos;s got nothing to do with what you or I like. I don&apos;t like 1/6th<br/>&gt; comma meantone, but the only reason I question the current fad of<br/>&gt; using it as a default temperament for this era is precisely all those<br/>&gt; guys who said otherwise. Punkt schluss.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; I did try it out myself in ensemble, and it happened to work<br/>&gt; &gt; marvelously.  This was in a concert earlier this year with two<br/>&gt; &gt; professors who spend most of their time doing mainstream<br/>&gt; &gt; ensemble/orchestral/teaching, not Baroque specialty.  I played<br/>&gt; &gt; harpsichord, and the other two musicians played bassoon and cello.  It<br/>&gt; &gt; was for a bassoon recital, and she played Baroque bassoon on this, but<br/>&gt; &gt; modern bassoon for everything else. [snip]This overall intonation<br/>&gt; scheme made the music easy and<br/>&gt; &gt; unproblematic to play, which is of course part of the point of<br/>&gt; &gt; selecting an appropriate temperament for the music.  It all sounded<br/>&gt; &gt; natural enough to me, too, as to what that Baroque bassoon was already<br/>&gt; &gt; inclined to do with its intonation.  It certainly wasn&apos;t set up in or<br/>&gt; &gt; bowdlerized to equal.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; So, two modern musicians who normally play ET found it easy to use<br/>&gt; your intonation scheme to everyone&apos;s mutual satisfaction. Why, that<br/>&gt; must indeed prove Tosi was right!! How very scientific! Yes, now I&apos;m<br/>&gt; utterly convinced.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; So, really, what&apos;s the point of trying to discredit Tosi&apos;s expert<br/>&gt; &gt; witness in the first decades of the 18th C?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Nobody is trying to discredit Tosi, I&apos;m just pointing out problems<br/>&gt; with your affirmations about what Tosi meant.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; Or to discredit the<br/>&gt; &gt; writings of any other suitably expert musician/teacher, of the time?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Uh, I don&apos;t understand your motivation for bringing that one up?

Actually, is there ANY indication whatsoever for the<br/>actual use of regular 1/6 mean in any historical period other than<br/>Sorge&apos;s description of Silbermann&apos;s tuning of a couple organs?</p><p>Just for the record, we should not forget the temperament Werckmeister<br/>recommended in 1698 for continuo realization, which is a modified<br/>meantone. While at first reading it may appear to leave a considerable<br/>amount of wiggle room, when you sit down and analyze what he says, the<br/>limit of possibilities which satisfy all of his stated conditions is<br/>actually rather narrow. For the 7 or 8 identically tempered fifths<br/>(what I call the &quot;main sequence&quot;, borrowing a term from astronomy),<br/>the narrowest possibility is about 1/5 comma and the widest either 1/6<br/>(with F-C pure) or 1/7 (with F-C narrow). Any closer to pure and<br/>you&apos;ve got no overcompensation (&quot;harmonic waste&quot; as Jorgy calls it -<br/>love that term!) to cancel with the wide fifths. So one could argue<br/>that this temperament strongly suggests the use of a basic tempering<br/>of approximately 1/6 comma as a point of departure for a<br/>semicirculating modified meantone. However, since Werckmeister himself<br/>specifically states that he doesn&apos;t want to define any particular<br/>comma (by which I assume he means any specific fraction of any comma<br/>for the individual fifths), no matter how much the numbers seem to<br/>suggest 1/6, we cannot pronounce anything like &quot;the system<br/>Werckmeister was starting from was indeed a 1/6 comma meantone.&quot;</p><p>Seriously, though, getting back to the matter of 17th century (or ANY<br/>century, for that matter) indications for the use of 1/6 mean, of<br/>course this text is very late to qualify as a 17th century document,<br/>squeaking by by the hair of its chinny chin chin as it does.<br/>Furthermore, other than &quot;discrediting&quot; those who persist in using 1/4<br/>comma meantone (which he does in no uncertain terms), Werckmeister<br/>offers no clue as to whether or not his recommendation for how the<br/>practicing keyboard player can best temper his instrument was based<br/>standard practice or represented a new approach.</p><p>I suppose I really ought to read Duffin&apos;s book one of these days,<br/>although we don&apos;t have it here in the ESMUC library, and I&apos;m loath to<br/>spend my own hard-earned Euros just to know upon which sources he<br/>bases his claims for 1/6 comma usage. Maybe somebody who has the book<br/>could do us all the favor of citing the specific sources, including<br/>the original texts, if it&apos;s not too much to ask? It would make for<br/>interesting debate, I suspect.</p><p>I&apos;d also really like to know Duffin&apos;s technical procedure for<br/>analyzing recordings of violinists tuning. Having done a fair bit of<br/>temperament and intonation deduction based on recordings of live<br/>string and wind playing (mostly Indian and Arabic), I can say that any<br/>real precision is quite difficult to achieve, especially since bowed<br/>strings all suffer from subtle pitch change depending upon bow<br/>pressure and speed. My methods have always been two fold: make a loop<br/>of the bit to analyze and set it playing repeatedly, then compare it<br/>to a generated tone of similar color which is tuned by ear to achieve<br/>the minimal beating, the frequency of which is then taken as the<br/>frequency of the recorded note; secondly, if the waveform of the tone<br/>can be clearly viewed, without interference of other tones sounding at<br/>the same time, simply counting the number of milliseconds for 20 or 30<br/>periods, a process which must be done at several different places in<br/>the sample and the results averaged. Let me postulate - Duffin doesn&apos;t<br/>describe his techniques? Wouldn&apos;t surprise me.</p><p>Ciao,</p><p>P</p></div><h3><a id=73971 href="#73971">ðŸ”—</a>Ozan Yarman &#x3C;ozanyarman@ozanyarman.com&#x3E;</h3><span>10/19/2007 10:55:20 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Hi monz,</p><p>----- Original Message -----<br/>From: &quot;monz&quot; &lt;<a href="mailto:monz@tonalsoft.com">monz@tonalsoft.com</a>&gt;<br/>To: &lt;<a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>&gt;<br/>Sent: 19 Ekim 2007 Cuma 9:45<br/>Subject: [tuning] Re: Tosi, what he did or didn&apos;t say</p><p>&gt; Hi Oz,<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; --- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;Ozan Yarman&quot; &lt;ozanyarman@...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; It is most intriguing, that Antoine Murat, a westernized<br/>&gt; &gt; Turk, has explained Maqam Music tuning of the 18th century<br/>&gt; &gt; in terms of 9 commas per whole tone, 55 to the octave.<br/>&gt; &gt; Don&apos;t you think there is a parallel here?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Are you sure it&apos;s the version of 9 commas per whole-tone<br/>&gt; which makes 55-edo?

Pshaw.</p><p>Or to use 1/6 comma not as any sort of compromise, but for its own<br/>attractively musical sake (such as the pure tritones, and the usability<br/>of misspelled triads B major, F# major, and C# major in first<br/>inversion.  That works because the outer notes hit very close to an<br/>11:7 sixth (Eb-B, Bb-F#, and F-C#), and therefore sound attractively<br/>resonant...even though those same three misspelled triads in root<br/>position are less attractive.  Nobody 17th century ever bothered to try<br/>this (whether they wrote it down or not)?  Pshaw.  Anybody screwing<br/>around with &quot;a little bit sharp&quot; major 3rds, and gentler-than-1/4-comma<br/>5ths, on a real harpsichord (past or present) is bound to hit on such<br/>happy results, whether they can explain them technically with any maths<br/>or not.

At the<br/>same time, my musical experience tells me: how could the decent<br/>musicians (or at least one or several of them) *not* have hit upon<br/>this, with or without the help of &quot;Ramarin&quot; or any others?  This stuff<br/>is just not that hard to do or to perceive, working directly at a<br/>decent instrument with a tuning lever in hand, whether one understands<br/>the maths or not.  (And yes, I had to go cogitate for a while *why*<br/>those sixths such as Eb-B were sounding so nice, without knowing<br/>immediately that they were near 11:7; but the sound itself was obvious,<br/>and immediate perception, first.)</p><p>Brad Lehman</p></div><h3><a id=73976 href="#73976">ðŸ”—</a>monz &#x3C;monz@tonalsoft.com&#x3E;</h3><span>10/19/2007 1:12:08 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Hi Oz,</p><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;Ozan Yarman&quot; &lt;ozanyarman@...&gt; wrote:</p><p>&gt; &gt; [me, monz]<br/>&gt; &gt; Are you sure it&apos;s the version of 9 commas per whole-tone<br/>&gt; &gt; which makes 55-edo? &lt;snip&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Remember that I translated the material here:<br/>&gt; <a href="/tuning/topicId_70676.html#70681">/tuning/topicId_70676.html#70681</a></p><p>Ah, yes, thanks.

For example, Bb-D-F#-A# plus the flip from A# to Bb to get<br/>our octave.  Since each tone in this system is built of 9 chunks, and<br/>each major 3rd is two of those tones (i.e. 18 chunks), and the<br/>enharmonic error is one chunk: 18 + 18 + 18 + 1 = 55.</p><p>Or if you prefer: that&apos;s six tones (9 each) plus one name change.<br/>Bb-C-D-E-F#-G#-A# plus the A# to Bb.  9 + 9 + 9 + 9 + 9 + 9 + 1 = 55.</p><p>Or, using the hexachord system that Tosi said was the normal way of<br/>thinking about scales: we&apos;ve got Ut-Re-Mi-Fa-Sol; it mutates and that<br/>Sol becomes a new Ut; Ut-Re-Mi-Fa and we&apos;ve completed the octave<br/>(C-D-E-F-G; G-A-B-C...which could also be thought of as two<br/>Ut-Re-Mi-Fa tetrachords next to one another).  Each of those two Mi-Fa<br/>steps is the &quot;large&quot; semitone, as Tosi says, i.e. 5 chunks.  And<br/>tallying all this up we have two Ut-Re steps, two Re-Mi steps, and one<br/>Fa-Sol step.</p><p>Tosi didn&apos;t say anything about two or three different sizes of tones<br/>here (even if some theorists before and after him *did*, or would<br/>throw some just-intonation premises into the mix here, about major and<br/>minor tones).  Tosi&apos;s only assertion about tones was that they get<br/>split up in 5:4 proportion to make the major and minor semitones.  So,<br/>implicitly here (and I know someone here will scream to differ!),<br/>those Ut-Re steps, Re-Mi steps, and the Fa-Sol step are all the same<br/>size as one another *to Tosi*, namely 9 chunks.  And 9 + 9 + 5 + 9 + 9<br/>+ 9 + 5 = 55.</p><p>&gt; &gt; Anyway, if even Gene doesn&apos;t get it right first time, what hope<br/>&gt; &gt; would the ordinary singing student or (say) flute player have?<br/>&gt; &gt; Even if they do get to the &apos;right&apos; number 55, how could this be of<br/>&gt; &gt; any conceivable practical help?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; This question misses the point, which is that if you make some<br/>&gt; staightforward assumptions about what *Tosi*, not a flute player,<br/>&gt; thought, based on what he says, the conclusion of 55 follows.</p><p>The question not only misses the point (as you&apos;ve correctly pointed<br/>out), it&apos;s also merely argumentative.  If even a thoroughly smart<br/>string-theory physicist can&apos;t (or chooses not to) grasp a<br/>straightforward New Grove article, asserting the 17th century<br/>existence and widespread importance IN PRACTICE of meantone systems<br/>gentler than 1/4 comma, and the 55-division illustrated by Antonio<br/>Fernandez in 1626 (SIXTEEN-twenty-six!), or prefers to believe it&apos;s<br/>only the province of keyboard-based wankers instead of other<br/>musicians, ...what hope would the ordinary singing student or flute<br/>player have?</p><p>Tiny Tim the Voice Student, God bless us every one, doesn&apos;t or needn&apos;t<br/>give a rip about the octave-division chunks or counting them up in any<br/>numerical way.  He only needs to know what the dang things *sound*<br/>like properly when he&apos;s practicing his Ut-Re-Mi-Fa-Sol-La as scales<br/>and leaps, performing &quot;in tune&quot; according to whatever system(s)<br/>happen(s) to be prevalent.  If he hits the right pitches he&apos;s in tune.<br/>If he judges them incorrectly and hits the cracks between where<br/>they&apos;re supposed to be, he&apos;s out of tune.  He also needs to keep<br/>performing correctly whenever the music modulates or mutates to put Ut<br/>and all its brethren onto some new pitch level.  All those regular<br/>systems of whatever size exist to help make this an easy process:<br/>regularity of relative pitch placement, wherever we&apos;ve located Ut for<br/>a given passage.  And those pitches all have their properly designated<br/>spots whether there&apos;s a keyboard or other inflexible instrument<br/>playing, or not.</p><p>The 55-chunk division, &quot;How could this be of any conceivable practical<br/>help?&quot;!!  It could help the student of voice or any melody instrument<br/>to practice and perform evenly and correctly-proportioned hexachords<br/>and their mutations, that&apos;s how!</p><p>(...)<br/>E F# G# A B C#<br/>A B C# D E F#<br/>D E F# G A B<br/>G A B C D E<br/>C D E F G A<br/>F G A Bb C D<br/>Bb C D Eb F G<br/>Eb F G Ab Bb C<br/>(...)</p><p>The semitone in the middle of all those is always a Mi-Fa.  It&apos;s<br/>always going to be sized 5 chunks, melodically.  And all those other<br/>whole tones in there, whether at the moment they&apos;re serving as Ut-Re,<br/>Re-Mi, Fa-Sol, or Sol-La, are implicitly interchangeable with one<br/>another (we can start a scale anywhere...), namely a consistent size<br/>of 9 chunks.  They&apos;re not made up of 8, 10, or fractional almost-9<br/>sizes; they&apos;re 9.</p><p>The student can start on a G and take a step to A, Ut-Re.  Or, he can<br/>start on F and take two steps Ut-Re-Mi to G and A.  The G to A step is<br/>going to be the same size whether he stuck an F in front of it or not.<br/>The equality of *the* step, whether it&apos;s Ut-Re or Re-Mi, makes the<br/>system *easy* and practical to learn.  A student who sings all the way<br/>from C-D-E-F-G-A-B-C-D-E-F-G doesn&apos;t have to worry about two<br/>potentially different choices for A&apos;s pitch in there (egads, is it La<br/>or Re, having made a shift to supply the forthcoming B?)...he simply<br/>sings *the* pitch for A, which happens to be 41 chunks above C, the<br/>same as he would do if leaping directly from C to A.  Continuing, he<br/>hits 50, 55, 64, 73, 78, 87, 96....</p><p>If he&apos;s singing &quot;pure&quot; and correct intonation according to the<br/>standard of this system, he&apos;s hitting those marks: the proper mark,<br/>and not fudging it to the spaces between the marks either.  Whether he<br/>gets there by steps or leaps, a correctly-spelled and<br/>correctly-intoned major 6th is always going to be that same distance<br/>of 41/55 of the octave, whether it comes up in music as Ut-La, Fa-Re,<br/>or Sol-Mi.  Learn what it sounds like, as a consistent distance, and<br/>do it.  A correctly-intoned 4th, whether it&apos;s Ut-Fa or Re-Sol or<br/>Mi-La, is always going to be 23/55 of the octave.  Learn by ear and<br/>experience *the* size of that interval, use it consistently, and it<br/>can be applied to all musical situations whether there are ornamental<br/>passing notes within that leap or not.</p><p>(See also Ross Duffin&apos;s footnote on page 72 of his book, about<br/>Mattheson&apos;s 1725 citation of the &quot;pure&quot; (rein) layout of Silbermann&apos;s<br/>temperament...regular 1/6 comma....)</p><p>Now if anyone, whether Galliard or a modern writer, inserts the<br/>premise of unequally-sized tones into Tosi&apos;s model, making the Ut-Re<br/>be bigger than the Re-Mi...now we have to deal with not only two sizes<br/>of semitone, but four or maybe six or eight.  Chop up each of those<br/>steps Ut-Re, Re-Mi, Fa-Sol, Sol-La from the hexachord system into 5:4<br/>proportioned semitones.  Is that was Tosi was really into, a<br/>microtonality that fine, basing it on two to four *different* sizes of<br/>tones?  Despite the fact that he didn&apos;t say so?</p><p>Brad Lehman</p></div><h3><a id=74071 href="#74071">ðŸ”—</a>Andreas Sparschuh &#x3C;a_sparschuh@yahoo.com&#x3E;</h3><span>10/25/2007 12:50:25 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;monz&quot; &lt;monz@...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; First of all, it&apos;s *all* hearsay, because nothing<br/>&gt; actually *by* Philolaus exists.<br/>Fully agreed.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; According to the last fragment in Boethius (book 3,<br/>&gt; chapter 8), we get the following:</p><p>online available under:<br/><a href="http://www.chmtl.indiana.edu/tml/6th-8th/BOEMUS3_TEXT.html">http://www.chmtl.indiana.edu/tml/6th-8th/BOEMUS3_TEXT.html</a></p><p>&gt;<br/>&gt; (click the &quot;Option | Use Fixed Width Font&quot; links for<br/>&gt; viewing correctly on the stupid Yahoo web interface)<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;                    -- 2,3-monzo --<br/>&gt;                         2     3         ~cents<br/>&gt; schisma            [ -19/2   6   &gt;    11.73000519<br/>It&apos;s difficult to find that modern<br/>interpretation in the original:<br/>There&apos;s no reason to derive that present-day view<br/>from the old source-texts.<br/>To impute fractional &apos;monzo&apos;s on Philolaos is alike:<br/>&quot;to break a fly on the wheel&quot;</p><p>Doubtless:<br/>Philoaos never intended to divide the PC into 2<br/>logarithmically equal parts.<br/>Nobody at that time was able to perform such advanced maths.</p><p>&gt; diaschisma         [   4    -5/2 &gt;    45.11249784<br/>Here the term sqrt(3) appears even<br/>more ahistorically than the above imputed sqrt(2).<br/>Pythagoreans alike Philolaos avoided<br/><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Irrational_number">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Irrational_number</a><br/>s as far as possible, also did Euclid in his<br/><a href="http://ota.ahds.ac.uk/textinfo/0241.html">http://ota.ahds.ac.uk/textinfo/0241.html</a><br/>&apos;sectio canonis&apos;</p><p>&gt; integral 1/2-tone  [  -3/2   1   &gt;   101.9550009</p><p>&gt; The Philolaus &quot;schisma&quot; is defined<br/>&gt; as 1/2 comma, and his &quot;diaschisma&quot; is 1/2 diesis.<br/>Arithmetically or harmonically bisection split generally<br/>any none-quadratic ratio in two different parts,<br/>amounting different in seize,<br/>but never into 2 equal halves.<br/>cf:<br/>Werckmeister, &apos;Mus.

Given the kind of tuning and the kind of theory that Gene is<br/>interested in, certain assumptions *appear* to be straightforward. If<br/>one accepts the premise that Tosi&apos;s preoccupations were similar to<br/>Gene&apos;s, no further objection can be raised.</p><p>But if you make other, equally straightforward assumptions about how<br/>Tosi thought and how he proceeded in writing his book, the conclusions<br/>you can come to are quite different.</p><p>Now since Tosi doesn&apos;t tell us what assumptions he himself had (how<br/>could he, since the assumptions were either unconscious or<br/>unarticulated...) how can we proceed?</p><p>The main skill to being a reasonably good historian is to realise that<br/>the assumptions that we make today, and the points which we find more<br/>or less important, may not be anything like the same as for people<br/>made 250 years ago. For example the unspoken definition of &apos;interval&apos;<br/>that Gene confessed to applying. For him, the purpose of speaking<br/>about &apos;intervals&apos; is to give them a definite size and/or place within<br/>a regular mathematical structure.</p><p>For Tosi, the idea of &apos;interval&apos; could be quite different: for<br/>example, it is what occurs between singing two different notes. Then,<br/>for example, the correct tuning of an interval (meaning one particular<br/>notated interval in its musical context) could mean that the resulting<br/>melodic line sounds acceptable in sung performance. That means that<br/>the same notated interval, in different contexts, could be correctly<br/>tuned in several, possibly widely divergent, ways. We could experiment<br/>ourselves with this definition, and see how wide the deviations are<br/>that we can happily accept for a soprano with string accompaniment -<br/>and ask ourselves where this leaves Gene&apos;s definition of an interval.</p><p>How can we tell whether or not Tosi thought it was desirable that<br/>every tone should be the same size? Did he give any conscious<br/>consideration to the question?

What we have are one<br/>&gt; fragment quoted by Nicomachus and two other<br/>&gt; fragments<br/>&gt; quoted by Boethius.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; According to the last fragment in Boethius (book 3,<br/>&gt; chapter 8), we get the following:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; (click the &quot;Option | Use Fixed Width Font&quot; links for<br/>&gt; viewing correctly on the stupid Yahoo web interface)<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;                    -- 2,3-monzo --<br/>&gt;                         2     3         ~cents<br/>&gt; schisma            [ -19/2   6   &gt;    11.73000519<br/>&gt; comma              [ -19    12   &gt;    23.46001038<br/>&gt; diaschisma         [   4    -5/2 &gt;    45.11249784<br/>&gt; diesis             [   8    -5   &gt;    90.22499567<br/>&gt; integral 1/2-tone  [  -3/2   1   &gt;   101.9550009<br/>&gt; apotome            [ -11     7   &gt;   113.6850061<br/>&gt; tone               [  -3     2   &gt;   203.9100017<br/>&gt; 4th                [   2    -1   &gt;   498.0449991<br/>&gt; &#x9;&#x9;<br/>&gt; Note that this definition of &quot;diesis&quot; is<br/>&gt; idiosyncratic<br/>&gt; (however, it is also the earliest): it&apos;s exactly the<br/>&gt; same as the pythagorean &quot;limma&quot;. The &quot;comma&quot; is the<br/>&gt; pythagorean-comma. The Philolaus &quot;schisma&quot; is<br/>&gt; defined<br/>&gt; as 1/2 comma, and his &quot;diaschisma&quot; is 1/2 diesis.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; But note that a logarithmic 1/2 of his diaschisma<br/>&gt; is ~22.55 cents, quite close to the comma.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; My webpage on Philolaus has all of this:<br/>&gt; <a href="http://tonalsoft.com/enc/p/philolaus.aspx">http://tonalsoft.com/enc/p/philolaus.aspx</a><br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; But if you have or can get a copy of _Xenharmonikon_<br/>&gt; 18,<br/>&gt; i expanded this into a much fuller treatment, with a<br/>&gt; very extensive bibliography.
