Here I<br/>can come up with at least five definitions, maybe ranging from the<br/>most encompassing to the narrowest or most &quot;culture/style-specific&quot;:</p><p>      (1) Just intonation could be taken as synonymous with<br/>          rational intonation (RI), the use of integer ratios<br/>          (simple or complex) to build a complete tuning system;</p><p>      (2) Just intonation could additionally be taken to imply<br/>          that some intervals, especially those which may be<br/>          regarded as &quot;fully consonant&quot; or &quot;stable,&quot; have<br/>          _simple_ interval ratios (e.g. 3:2 and 4:3);</p><p>      (3) Just intonation could be yet further taken to suggest<br/>          a system featuring or tending toward superparticular<br/>          or epimore ratios for melodic steps and other types<br/>          of intervals, as with many Greek tetrachord schemes;</p><p>      (4) Just intonation could be taken to imply that ratios<br/>          based on two or more simple primes larger than two<br/>          are combined in a single system, giving rise to the<br/>          intricacy and frequent &quot;asymmetry&quot; associated with<br/>          a &quot;JI&quot; system (other than 3-limit or Pythagorean);<br/>          and</p><p>      (5) Most narrowly, but very commonly in a certain<br/>          perspective centered on composed European music<br/>          of c. 1480-1900, &quot;JI&quot; could be taken to imply<br/>          specifically &quot;5-limit JI,&quot; where the intervals<br/>          deemed to be stable concords in the styles of<br/>          this region and period are pure.</p><p>As it happens, my own perspective often focuses on intonational<br/>systems with 3:2 and 4:3 as the primary concords, so that a &quot;JI&quot;<br/>system means one where these concords are realized in many or most<br/>positions in pure form, and all intervals are rational (RI).</p><p>Thus I would regard any tetrachord based on a pure 4:3, divided in<br/>rational fashion, as &quot;JI,&quot; for example the 12:11:10:9 of Ptolemy, or<br/>also the 28:27:24:21 of Archytas. These divisions have lots of epimore<br/>steps -- 12:11, 11:10, 10:9; or 28:27, 9:8, 8:7.</p><p>With Monz, I can confirm that many books oriented mainly to European<br/>harmony in a late 15th-19th century style use the term &quot;just scale&quot; to<br/>describe specifically a 5-limit scale of the kind introduced by Ramos<br/>(1482) and made an ideal standard for vocal intonation by people such<br/>as Fogliano (1529) and Zarlino (1558).</p><p>However, this seems to me a very specific definition, having more to<br/>do with the nature of consonance/dissonance concepts in conventional<br/>music of this era than anything concerned with a more general concept<br/>of &quot;justness,&quot; &quot;purity,&quot; &quot;rational epimore structure,&quot; or whatever.</p><p>Indeed the &quot;n-limit&quot; concept may be most relevant for styles building<br/>on a Partchian kind of paradigm seeking to use _all_ primes and ratios<br/>up to a certain odd-limit, with Zarlino&apos;s senario or 5-limit scheme as<br/>one historical precedent.</p><p>This has led me to coin terms like &quot;7-flavor JI&quot; or &quot;3-7 JI&quot; for a<br/>system where the pure ratios are based on factors of 2-3-7-9, for<br/>example.</p><p>As it happens, Renaissance-Romantic European practice is based on<br/>4:5:6 rather than 12:14:18:21, for example; but I&apos;m not sure why, in<br/>the early 21st century, the former should be regarded as &quot;more just,&quot;<br/>or &quot;more typically just,&quot; except of course for discussions where that<br/>specific practice is the most salient.</p><p>Certainly it makes sense to alert a newcomer, or even a more<br/>experienced reader, that many books speak of _the_ &quot;just scale&quot; as<br/>specifically Zarlino&apos;s version of the 5-limit diatonic.</p><p>However, I see the range of perspectives as much larger, with the best<br/>solution maybe being simply to make explicit the different assumptions<br/>and levels of meaning often attached to the &quot;JI&quot; category.</p><p>Incidentally, I might speak specifically of RI -- as opposed to &quot;JI&quot;<br/>-- for a system which seems mainly designed to emulate some kind of<br/>irrational temperament. If a system features some pure versions of<br/>simple ratios, and especially if it has an epimoric kind of structure,<br/>then I&apos;d freely call it either JI or RI. A Pythagorean or 3-limit RI<br/>system I also consider JI, since it includes pure concords of 3:2 and<br/>4:3, and also epimore steps of 9:8.</p><p>Most appreciatively,</p><p>Margo Schulter<br/><a href="mailto:mschulter@value.net">mschulter@value.net</a></p></div><h3>paulerlich &#x3C;paul@stretch-music.com&#x3E;</h3><span>1/27/2002 9:11:56 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In tuning@y..., &quot;M.
