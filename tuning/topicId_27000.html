Beta-5 is the 5-7 schisma of ~5.75 cents. By<br/>the way, Scala uses this terminology.</p><p>The idea of the tempering of the fifth by 1/9 of Alpha, the 3-5<br/>schisma, is that a pure 6:5 or 5:3 is connected with a special effect<br/>which Sabat-Garibaldi terms a _trino harmonico_ -- not a Gothic trine,<br/>but a Spanish term for a kind of &quot;trill&quot; or similar effect.</p><p>Generally, he presents this 53-tone instrument as representing a kind<br/>of affinity between the gamuts of Pythagoras and Ptolemy -- that is,<br/>between Pythagorean tuning and 5-limit JI, through schismic<br/>equivalence as we might say. Of course, this statement could apply to<br/>anything close to Pythagorean; the choice of 1/9 Alpha seems to me a<br/>distinguishable question from the general purpose and philosophy of<br/>the tuning.</p><p>Most of the book seems to focus on factors of 3 and 5, with 5-limit<br/>thirds and sixths preferred, and a notation developed based on the<br/>53-tone system. The intonation of various intervals and sonorities is<br/>described in terms of these &quot;commas&quot; or steps; for example 0-22-31<br/>would be a sonority with a pure fourth and fifth in relation to the<br/>lowest note, and a ~9:8 major second (9 commas) between the upper<br/>notes.</p><p>There is a chapter on factors of 7, which includes an interesting table of<br/>&quot;triads&quot; of intervals -- meaning sets of three versions of an interval a<br/>&quot;comma&quot; apart such as major thirds at ~5:4, ~81:64, or ~9:7 (17, 18, or 19<br/>commas), based on ratios of 3, 5, or 7. However, I&apos;d say that the main<br/>outlook is on a kind of harmonic style where a 5-limit ideal mostly<br/>prevails.</p><p>He is very concerned with the problem of transposition -- or, as it<br/>said in Spanish as well as at least some 16th-century Romance<br/>languages, the &quot;transport&quot; of a sonority or scale pattern from one<br/>step to another.</p><p>The question of a Dinarra playing together with a 12-tET instrument is<br/>maybe a bit like the problem in the later 16th or early 17th century<br/>of a meantone keyboard playing with a 12-tET lute. Theorists discuss<br/>why it&apos;s not very appealing, but maybe the players could finesse it in<br/>one way or another.</p><p>Dave, your question of just how much accuracy in fretting is<br/>meaningful is an interesting point: with a 12-tET lute, the simple<br/>rule of 18:17 turns out to be more accurate than the correct<br/>logarithmic division because of the physics of fretting pressure.</p><p>Anyway, while Eduardo Sabat-Garabaldi&apos;s complete book may be the best<br/>source on his instrument -- and I&apos;d be very interested in his response<br/>if he posts here to my attempt at a summary -- I can at least confirm<br/>that 1/9 Alpha is the temperament, and a Pythagorean or 53-tET system<br/>with a certain 5-limit outlook a more general theme.</p><p>Maybe I&apos;m especially aware of this because the counting in &quot;commas&quot; is<br/>quite congenial to my own outlook, but my neo-Gothic orientation would<br/>lead me to emphasize different solutions. For example, he expresses a<br/>strong preference for a major third of 17 commas (~5:4) rather the<br/>usual Pythagorean ditone of 18 commas (~81:64).</p><p>If I were writing this, I might take 18 commas as the norm, with 17 as<br/>a special effect (the diminished fourth), and 19 as a desirable choice<br/>for many cadences where the major third (~9:7) expands to a fifth.</p><p>Whatever view one takes of the precise tuning desirable for a given<br/>musical style (e.g. 1/15-Beta2 for 2-3-7-9?), or the best intonational<br/>choices for that style, his Pythagorean system and 53-tone notational<br/>concepts might apply nicely.</p><p>Most respectfully,</p><p>Margo Schulter<br/><a href="mailto:mschulter@value.net">mschulter@value.net</a></p></div><h3><a id=27005 href="#27005">ðŸ”—</a>Afmmjr@aol.com</h3><span>8/14/2001 7:55:07 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>In a message dated 8/14/01 2:17:56 AM Eastern Daylight Time,<br/><a href="mailto:MSCHULTER@VALUE.NET">MSCHULTER@VALUE.NET</a> writes:</p><p>&gt; Hello, everyone, and on the basis of reading some of Eduardo<br/>&gt; Sabat-Garibaldi&apos;s treatise, I can certainly confirm that his<br/>&gt; instrument is tuned in a 1/9-schisma temperament with 53 frets per<br/>&gt; octave -- a &quot;virtually closed&quot; system very close to 53-tET (as is a<br/>&gt; 53-note Pythagorean tuning just on the other side of the point of<br/>&gt; precise mathematical closure).<br/>&gt;</p><p>Thank you, Margo, for checking out his book.
