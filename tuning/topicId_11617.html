It is too easy to run down simple ratios<br/>&gt; until you fine one that worked. In fact if you took random<br/>&gt; numbers the results would be the same. As I stated before,<br/>&gt; the relationships between the planets are not simple ratios.<br/>&gt; If they were, a resonance would build up and destroy the orbit.<br/>&gt; golden/noble relationships seem to be a necessity.<br/>&gt;    The problem will be as there are a infinite of whole number<br/>&gt; relationships, there are a infinite series of noble numbers;<br/>&gt; both can express the continuum.</p><p>I&apos;m not going to argue against the possibility of describing<br/>the relationships between the planetary orbital periods in myriad<br/>different ways other than low-integer ratios.  My piece and the<br/>post that explained it was simply an excercise exploring the<br/>ancient concept of &apos;music of the spheres&apos;, which was based<br/>primarily on low-integer ratios.</p><p>But you have to be careful to make sure that your ideas are<br/>reconciled with the physical facts.  Astronomers are certain<br/>that the Venus/Earth 13:8 ratio (actually, they seem to recognize<br/>it more as 8:5, but 13:8 is much more precise), the Jupiter/Saturn<br/>5:2, and especially the Neptune/Pluto 3:2 ratio exist, and in<br/>fact the word that they use to describe these synchronicities<br/>is precisely the one you see as a problem: resonance.</p><p>If the resonance were manifest thru the *overall* relationships<br/>of all 9 planets, then yes, perhaps it would destroy the orbits.<br/>But what I examined in detail in my post was the individual<br/>ratios between any two planets.  There *are* resonances in some<br/>of these cases, and they bring no apparent harm to the planets<br/>involved; I believe that the effect is small and subtle, probably<br/>similar to the tidal forces exerted by the Moon, but not as strong.</p><p>Please note that while I explored many possible rational<br/>interpretations of these orbits in my post, I did *not* use<br/>low-integer ratios in my MIDI-file.  The sound you are hearing<br/>is a very precise mapping of the actual orbital frequency ratios,<br/>which are *not* (except for the 3 cases noted above) very close<br/>to low-integer ratios.  It sounds like what it is:</p><p><a href="http://www.egroups.com/files/tuning/monz/solarsystem/Solar.mid">http://www.egroups.com/files/tuning/monz/solarsystem/Solar.mid</a></p><p>The only way I could have made it more accurate would have been<br/>to vary the pitches slightly over time - since the orbits of<br/>the planets are not circular but elliptical, their orbital<br/>velocities do vary somewhat (quite a bit in the case of Pluto).<br/>I used a constant mean velocity based on the orbital *period*.</p><p>&gt; [Dan Stearns]<br/>&gt; <a href="http://www.egroups.com/message/tuning/11930">http://www.egroups.com/message/tuning/11930</a><br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I still just get a Windows Media Player &quot;cannot open&quot; error<br/>&gt; message with this address as well... anyone else having this<br/>&gt; problem?</p><p>Hmmm... I clicked on the link as you quoted it in your post, Dan,<br/>and it worked fine... don&apos;t know what the problem is.</p><p>&gt; BTW, it&apos;s real nice to see a big ol&apos; up-all-night Monz post<br/>&gt; again...</p><p>I&apos;m *so* glad to hear that!  I know that you&apos;re a big fan of my<br/>work, and I was expecting something positive from you. ...Thanks!</p><p>&gt; however, should I somehow find myself bathed in the subliminal<br/>&gt; cosmic hum of a major chord, I&apos;m afraid me and my bag of atoms<br/>&gt; are going to have to seek asylum in some alternate reality!</p><p>Well, first of all, please note that the 9-note chord, of which<br/>I&apos;m only really hearing 6 notes anyway (Venus thru Uranus) sounds<br/>a lot like a major chord, but it&apos;s much more complicated than<br/>that.  There are lots of shimmering beats because of the slight<br/>mistuning of orbits that are *almost*, but not quite, an &apos;8ve&apos;<br/>apart.</p><p>And also remember that it wasn&apos;t *me* who put the planets into<br/>these orbits!  I&apos;m just analyzing the data that&apos;s out there.</p><p>&gt; [Joseph Pehrson]<br/>&gt; <a href="http://www.egroups.com/message/tuning/11933">http://www.egroups.com/message/tuning/11933</a><br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Joe Monzo&apos;s new hum is really incredible.

As the orbits are ellipses,<br/>&gt; He considered the planets moving in and out of these relation<br/>&gt; ships , like suspensions found in music.</p><p>Kraig,</p><p>Yes, this is interesting!
