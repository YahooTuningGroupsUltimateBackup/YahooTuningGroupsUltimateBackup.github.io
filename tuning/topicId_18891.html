(Well, I did some earlier pieces too,<br/>but not in the same intensity.)  How could I presume that I could<br/>&quot;reinvent the wheel&quot; to any good effect?</p><p>The system I was considering with quartertone alterations really is<br/>cumbersome and ungainly in contrast to this and was even going to<br/>CONTRADICT the historical usage of the meantone accidentals.<br/>Although the cents values are rather large in Wolf&apos;s system, I<br/>believe players can accustomize themselves to it rather readily,<br/>particularly if the scale is accompanied by an aural CD of it, which<br/>I intend...</p><p>However, in a bow to tradition and &quot;Ludditeism&quot; I have decided to<br/>include the 12-tET cents value above EVERY PITCH... so that,<br/>essentially it *IS* a 12-tET score rather than a NEW system of 19<br/>with different visual values for the sounding pitches.</p><p>I just feel more comfortable that way...</p><p>Thanks to everybody for all the help!  I don&apos;t know what I would do<br/>if I had to try to dream this all up myself.  It would be a mess,<br/>that&apos;s for sure...</p><p>Thanks again!!!!!!!!</p><p>______ ____ ____ ____ _<br/>Joseph Pehrson</p><p>                       19tet score   12tet score<br/>              &gt;               C             C<br/>              &gt;               C#            C# -37<br/>              &gt;               Db            Db +26<br/>              &gt;               D             D -11<br/>              &gt;               D#            D# -47<br/>              &gt;               Eb            Eb +16<br/>              &gt;               E             E -21<br/>              &gt;               E#/Fb         E#-58 or Fb +42<br/>              &gt;               F             F +5<br/>              &gt;               F#            F# -32<br/>              &gt;               Gb            Gb +32<br/>              &gt;               G             G -5<br/>              &gt;               G#            G# -42<br/>              &gt;               Ab            Ab +21<br/>              &gt;               A             A -16<br/>              &gt;               A#            A# -53<br/>              &gt;               Bb            Bb +11<br/>              &gt;               B             B-26<br/>              &gt;               B#/Cb         B#-63 or Cb +37</p></div><h3>PERLICH@ACADIAN-ASSET.COM</h3><span>2/17/2001 11:05:22 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In tuning@y..., jpehrson@r... wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; The system I was considering with quartertone alterations really is<br/>&gt; cumbersome and ungainly in contrast to this and was even going to<br/>&gt; CONTRADICT the historical usage of the meantone accidentals.</p><p>There are great reasons you wouldn&apos;t want to contradict it.

I was thinking of either researching tuning in English virginal<br/>music, or just concentrate on how tuning developed during a period.  I am<br/>not sure if their would be any bizarre issues to look into...  I guess<br/>ideally I would like to do something odd, such as split key keyboards<br/>allowing for enharmonics in meantone to be heard.  Possibly the early<br/>conception of 31-tone equal temperament, if that fits into this period.<br/>Anyway, I was hoping somebody could point me into a fascinating topic that I<br/>don&apos;t know anything about.</p><p>Thanks,</p><p>Steven Kallstrom<br/><a href="mailto:skallstr@sun.iwu.edu">skallstr@sun.iwu.edu</a></p></div><h3>PERLICH@ACADIAN-ASSET.COM</h3><span>2/18/2001 10:28:13 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In tuning@y..., &quot;Steven Kallstrom&quot; &lt;skallstr@s...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt; Hello list,<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &#x9;For my Upper Division Medieval/Renaissance Music course I<br/>have decided to<br/>&gt; research tuning.

It&apos;s perhaps the<br/>earliest known proposal for an &quot;adaptive JI&quot; system. That is, a<br/>system that keeps a certain class of harmonies, in this case major<br/>and minor triads and major seventh chords, in JI, while keeping the<br/>range of variation of the tuning of any given notated pitch much<br/>lower than the usual comma shifts and multi-comma drifts encountered<br/>in strict JI renditions). It requires two separate 1/4-comma meantone<br/>systems, tuned 1/4 comma apart from one another (Vicentino gives 19<br/>notes to one and 17 notes to the other, but that is somewhat<br/>arbitrary). You could, for example, take a piece of Renaissance<br/>music, and play it three ways: first in 1/4-comma meantone, where you<br/>might hear some beating in the fifths and fourths and even minor<br/>thirds and major sixths; second in strict just intonation (this will<br/>require some potentially arbitrary decisions on your part), where you<br/>might hear some comma-sized shifts in particular held or repeated<br/>pitches and/or an overall drift in the pitch level of the piece; and<br/>third in Vicentino&apos;s second tuning, where both of these problems will<br/>disappear.</p><p>Anyway, Margo Schulter has posted much about Vicentino as well as<br/>other bizarre developments in Renaissance music . . . a quick search<br/>for her name in this list&apos;s archives should uncover much of great<br/>interest to you . . .</p><p>P.S. I initially thought, from your name, that you had authored a<br/>page on meantone tuning, and hence were familiar with the basic<br/>issues . . . it turns out I was actually thinking of Stephen<br/>Malinowski . . . the page in question is<br/><a href="http://www.well.com/user/smalin/equal5th.htm">http://www.well.com/user/smalin/equal5th.htm</a><br/>. . . which is a great explanation of meantone tuning if you need a<br/>review.</p></div>
