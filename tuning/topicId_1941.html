Would this mean that those<br/>musicians were all, consciously or not, trying to tune to the mid-point of<br/>that distribution? Of course not. The distribution would have simply masked<br/>the wonderful variety of irregular temperaments, each with its own musical<br/>advantages.</p><p>You are right to urge caution here - but I certainly didnt take Dan<br/>Akkocs suggestion to imply an assumption that the distributions be<br/>normally distributed (perhaps the implication of using the &quot;mean&quot; as<br/>the best predictor?). In the example you suggest, you should be able<br/>to see from the distribution that the performances cluster into two<br/>(or more) groups, that is, that the distribution is bi- or multi-modal. I<br/>think this is why Dan is measuring individual performers.</p></div>
