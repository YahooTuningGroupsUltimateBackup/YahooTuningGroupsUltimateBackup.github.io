It is notated in 31-tET but he doesn&apos;t use<br/>31 tones in a xenharmonic way, so I also suppose there&apos;s no<br/>essential difference with JI. In one of the two fast movements<br/>he uses an Euler-Fokker genus.</p><p>&gt;My guess is that it might also be a little on the &quot;traditional&quot; side for<br/>&gt;the Kronos... but I could be wrong.</p><p>Yeah, you might be right.</p><p>Manuel</p></div>
