I think that stuff is pretty much<br/>&gt; played out now and will in the future be of little<br/>&gt; interest except to musicologists looking for obscure<br/>&gt; and forgotten 20thc. music to write their dissertations<br/>&gt; about.</p><p>I&apos;m looking over my shoulder for the brickbats<br/>that will come flying at me as I say this:</p><p>I *like* a lot of this stuff.  Sorry.</p><p>&quot;Just&quot; because I&apos;m so much into microtonal music<br/>doesn&apos;t mean I can&apos;t like totally abstract serial<br/>12-Eq music too.  I wish I got more of a feeling<br/>of open-mindedness about this from others on the<br/>List.</p><p>I&apos;ll be the first to admit that I can&apos;t *hear* a<br/>lot of the supposed complexity and systematization<br/>that&apos;s written into these pieces, but it&apos;s all<br/>still there, and I, and others who actually listen<br/>to this stuff, *must* be picking it up somehow,<br/>otherwise the music wouldn&apos;t get thru to us either.</p><p>I am a huge fan of Schoenberg, Webern, Boulez,<br/>Babbitt, and my friend Rand Steiger, who&apos;s a colleague<br/>of Brian Ferneyhough at UCSD.  Schoenberg and<br/>Steiger in particular have written music that<br/>I find very approachable and moving.</p><p>Of course, I *prefer* microtonal music, but I<br/>can still listen to and enjoy good music from<br/>any source.</p><p>Anyone who&apos;s willing to devote his life to<br/>scribbling notes on music-paper obviously has<br/>something to say that he can&apos;t say in any other<br/>way, and believes strongly in the power of that<br/>medium to get it across. Otherwise he would never<br/>choose the career of composer over something more<br/>obviously and outwardly rewarding.</p><p>If his medium happens to be abstract 12-Eq, then<br/>I think it&apos;s worth finding out how he intended that<br/>12-Eq scale to be used to make his music express what<br/>he intended it to express.  Granted, it may not<br/>even have much to do with actual sound, but as<br/>some of us pointed out here recently, neither does<br/>a lot of what we talk about on this list.</p><p>It is possible to appreciate the aesthetic beauty<br/>of any &quot;composition&quot;, whether that means a performed<br/>and heard musical piece, an unheard score, or a book of<br/>mathematical equations and lattice diagrams.  I think<br/>this was one of the points John Cage made with his<br/>publication of &quot;Notations&quot;.  Frank Zappa said it best:<br/>&quot;a composer is someone who assembles things&quot;.</p><p>At the same time, mentioning Ferneyhough in connection<br/>with prose (and bringing Babbitt&apos;s name into it too)<br/>reminds me how incomprehensibly some of these composers<br/>write *about* music.  I saw a book by Ferneyhough<br/>at UCSD and laughed out loud at how convoluted<br/>it was.  Babbitt is extremely guilty of the same<br/>charge, but at least when reading his prose, I<br/>got a sense that he was *trying* to say something<br/>important, or that he cared passionately about<br/>his subject.</p><p>[Rosati:]<br/>&gt; I think its the combination of over abstraction<br/>&gt; of sound and rhythm at the same time that puts<br/>&gt; that music beyond the pale. One or the other works<br/>&gt; better, thats why Schoenberg&apos;s serial tonality set<br/>&gt; in late romantic rhetoric is more listenable.<br/>&gt; Conversely, Thelonius Monk&apos;s sometimes far out<br/>&gt; rhythmic abstraction is framed by tonal harmony<br/>&gt; and also works.</p><p>This is a very good observation.  The only points I can<br/>make contra it are that some people *do* find that<br/>doubly-abstracted music worthwhile (as I said above),<br/>and that Monk&apos;s harmony is not entirely what I would<br/>call &quot;tonal&quot;.</p><p>I suppose in the end it depends on how much time and<br/>effort one is willing to spend in learning what it is<br/>that&apos;s communicative in a mode of music-making that is<br/>unfamiliar.  It all really boils down to what you&apos;re<br/>used to and how open-minded you are.</p><p>I know lots of people who are as baffled by Monk<br/>as they are by Babbitt, and and just as uninterested<br/>too.</p><p>And lest we forget, just as many who are baffled<br/>by, and uninterested in, Partch.</p><p>- Monzo<br/><a href="http://www.ixpres.com/interval/monzo/homepage.html">http://www.ixpres.com/interval/monzo/homepage.html</a></p><p>___________________________________________________________________<br/>You don&apos;t need to buy Internet access to use free Internet e-mail.<br/>Get completely free e-mail from Juno at <a href="http://www.juno.com/getjuno.html">http://www.juno.com/getjuno.html</a><br/>or call Juno at (800) 654-JUNO [654-5866]</p></div><h3>Joseph L Monzo &#x3C;monz@xxxx.xxxx&#x3E;</h3><span>3/13/1999 4:40:17 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>[Tagawa, TD 95:]<br/>&gt; Elliott Carter, by the way, hears all microtonal<br/>&gt; music as &quot;out-of-tune.&quot;</p><p>[Alves, TD 95:]<br/>&gt; Personally, I hear all of Elliott Carter&apos;s music<br/>&gt; as &quot;out of tune.&quot;</p><p>[Pagano, TD 97:]<br/>&gt; i dig Elliot Carters music and it is hard for me to<br/>&gt; believe such an innovator spoke in such a manner but<br/>&gt; maybe he was talking about Haba--hah!</p><p>I like Haba, too!</p><p> |\=/|.-&quot;&quot;&quot;-.
