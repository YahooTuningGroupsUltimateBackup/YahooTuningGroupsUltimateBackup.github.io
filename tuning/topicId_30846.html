These two properties only need to be entered for one octave. Then it reproduces the pitch property column 20 more times, shifting it by one pitch each time. Then for each of these 21 mappings it calculates where the key property coincides with the pitch property, and at the top of each such column, gives counts of the number of times the properties coincide (one count for a 61-key board and another for an 88-key board). It flags those with the maximum number.</p><p>Examples are included for white naturals, white tetrads and white pentads.</p><p>You&apos;ll find it at<br/>hyttp://uq.net.au/~zzdkeena/Music/Miracle/Blackjack21KeyMapComparator.xls.zip</p><p>It&apos;s a zipped Excel 97 spreadsheet (124 kB).

Sorry to be so *dense*<br/>&gt; about what is, possibly, self-explanatory...<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Thanks!</p><p>I&apos;m glad you asked, because I found mistakes in the white tetrads and white pentads parts. I&apos;ve fixed these and added decimal notation alongside the 6x12 notation. I&apos;ve also added a fourth comparison that counts decimal naturals falling on black keys. The new version is (145 KB) at</p><p><a href="http://dkeenan.com/Music/Miracle/Blackjack21KeyMapComparator.xls.zip">http://dkeenan.com/Music/Miracle/Blackjack21KeyMapComparator.xls.zip</a></p><p>I&apos;m sorry I don&apos;t have time to explain it much more. Maybe someone else can help? But here&apos;s a bit more. Maybe you can ask specific questions after this.</p><p>The spreadsheet contains four (almost) identical blocks. Each one checks the 21 possible mappings, for the coincidence of a certain key property with a certain pitch property. e.g. The upper left one checks how many times whiteness of key coincides with naturalness of pitch in the 6x12 notation.</p><p>You describe the key and pitch properties by entering zeros and ones (in the blue regions) and then you read off the number of times they coincide for each mapping (from the yellow regions). The mappings are referred to by giving the blackjack pitch that falls on the middle-C key.</p><p>Ignore all the numbers in white cells (except for a few we&apos;ll mention later).</p><p>e.g. In H10 and H12 you can see that the mapping that puts a F#v on the middle-C key (so the middle-C pitch could be on either the D below middle-C key or the B above middle-C key) is the only mapping that gives maximum white naturals on both a 61-key and an 88-key keyboard. The overbars indicate a maximum.</p><p>In AD10 and AD12 you can see that the C on mid-C mapping has 4 less white naturals than the maximum possible, on both keyboards.</p><p>Now scroll right and look at BQ10 BQ12 CO10 CO12. You will see that by putting either a Bb^ or a F&lt; on the middle-C key, we get the maximum number of 7-limit otonal tetrads on all white keys, irrespective of whether it is a 61-key or 88-key board (9 and 13 respectively).</p><p>If you want to know how many otonal tetrads (of any colour) there are in a given keyboard mapping, just look one cell below and to the left of the yellow square. e.g. looking at cells BQ12 and BP13 we learn that this (Bb^ on mid-C) mapping gives us 28 tetrads on an 88-key board, 13 of which are all-white.</p><p>Notice (in BX13) that the C on mid-C mapping gives two less tetrads on an 88-key board, (irrespective of their colour).</p><p>Now look at V131, V133, AT131, AT133. You&apos;ll see that the Bb^ and F&lt; mappings give the maximum number of 4:5:6:7:9 chords on all white keys, however they don&apos;t give the maximum number of such chords (of any colour) on the keyboard. Look at E134 and I134 to see that it is the F] and G&lt; mappings that do that.</p><p>Hope that helps.</p><p>-- Dave Keenan<br/>Brisbane, Australia<br/><a href="http://dkeenan.com">http://dkeenan.com</a></p></div><h3><a id=30890 href="#30890">ðŸ”—</a>jpehrson@rcn.com</h3><span>12/2/2001 8:49:36 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In tuning@y..., David C Keenan &lt;D.KEENAN@U...&gt; wrote:</p><p><a href="/tuning/topicId_30846.html#30885">/tuning/topicId_30846.html#30885</a></p><p>&gt;<br/>&gt; You describe the key and pitch properties by entering zeros and<br/>ones (in the blue regions) and then you read off the number of times<br/>they coincide for each mapping (from the yellow regions).
