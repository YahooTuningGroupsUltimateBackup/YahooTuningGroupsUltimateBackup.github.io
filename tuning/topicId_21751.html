A detailed  and fruitful debate has<br/>arisen over the uses and abuses of C Sound and computers in general. I<br/>thought I&apos;d share with y&apos;all some of the reasons I have for setting out<br/>to explore this amazing musical resource.</p><p>I have an electronic studio which probably reached state of the art for<br/>about 3 nanoseconds sometime in the late 90&apos;s. Then Macintosh brought<br/>out their new line of iMacs, eliminating floppy drives and SCSI and<br/>bringing in USB ports and a new Operating System. Steinberg upgraded<br/>Cubase VST which meant that my master disk crashes with newer operating<br/>systems. They refuse to reply to my constant emails requesting a fix for<br/>this. So I basically decided that Steinberg can go and &amp;*^% themselves<br/>(same goes for Macintosh, but I need a computer to correspond with<br/>y&apos;all).  I then asked what I wanted from all this technology. My main<br/>interest is in &apos;physical&apos; musical instruments. I find time to  compose<br/>for 22 tet guitar and to play lute. Now I&apos;ve started building and tuning<br/>instruments and I&apos;ve never been happier. But I&apos;m still fascinated with<br/>electronics and feel that  familiarity  at least is essential for<br/>contemporary composers. I&apos;m a great admirer of people like Ivor Darreg<br/>who was proficient as a builder, tuner and designer of electronic<br/>systems.</p><p>Computer/electronic music, and I include midi systems, is difficult to<br/>partition in terms of art versus functional music. This is a big topic.<br/>I like to think of myself as an artist, striving to create beauty and<br/>honour the Creator (sounds conceited but I mean it humbly). I don&apos;t like<br/>pop music and I&apos;m sick of dance music, so making functional music would<br/>be a waste of my time. I have the greatest respect for those who can<br/>produce music of quality using midi systems. I never liked my work with<br/>midi, except when producing techno, ambient or drum &amp; bass, or when<br/>modelling compositions. Midi is  good for programming beats. Aphex Twin<br/>and Autechre and  numerous others manage to transcend the functionality<br/>of dance music and produce at times works of art and virtuosity. I don&apos;t<br/>want to clone their work however and my principal interests lie<br/>elsewhere, namely, in instrument making and alternative tuning systems<br/>of the sort we discuss. I&apos;m still unsure as to the effect of electronic<br/>beats on the listener. I prefer raw live sounds myself. I was letting a<br/>pianist/chorister friend listen to some  analogue synth compositions<br/>(soon to be mp3s), played live and made using a Doepfer analogue synth<br/>system (an A-100) and analogue sequencer with FX  and he was bowled<br/>over. Noticing the drum machine he suggested adding beats but I pointed<br/>out that you then lose the beauty of the irregularity of envelope and<br/>LFO modulations if you pin down everything with beats.</p><p>(An aside, I recently heard of someone being refused funding from a<br/>&quot;classical&quot; source because the music had beats. Was that on this list?<br/>Would Steve Reich have been turned down?  Obviously barriers still to<br/>come down.)</p><p>The point I&apos;m labouring at here is that I no longer need midi. For pure<br/>electronic music of the arty variety I use a simple but  powerful<br/>system. Although I can&apos;t model sophisticated tuning systems, I can pull<br/>parts of the harmonic series out of complex waveforms and I can tune the<br/>2 oscillators relative to each other using a very smooth tuning control.<br/>I would hope that this music would be of interest in terms of tuning.<br/>All in real time and with total clarity and depth. Unfortunately the<br/>analogue sequencer (a Doepfer MAQ) sends out notes stepped to 12 et but<br/>I can overcome this by sending the same pitch to both oscillators and<br/>then tuning the oscillators from the tuning knob. So the sequencer<br/>becomes a tremendous real time rhythmic generator.</p><p>I had intended to use my midi set up to model tunings and timbres prior<br/>to building, say, a tubulong or zither. But now that I&apos;ve got sick of<br/>the greed and indifference of the large companies who provide the<br/>products I can&apos;t bring myself to keep throwing money at them. I am<br/>therefore attracted to C Sound. It seems to me to be simple but not easy<br/>if you get my drift. Also I post a problem and within hours I get<br/>replies from the best experts around the world. Very impressive. I can<br/>now learn to model timbres and tunings using just my Mac. No cables, no<br/>shelling out for this or that upgrade, no extension conflicts, just a<br/>few initial glitches, now sorted, and a steep learning curve. I don&apos;t<br/>see the time spent as composition time lost. Leave no stone unturned as<br/>they say. Maybe in a few years I will to be able to produce &apos;pure&apos;<br/>computer music that would be of artistic interest, though that is<br/>secondary. I&apos;m not in a position yet to judge whether C sound will be as<br/>sonically powerful as my analogue system. I doubt if I could get round<br/>to composing for computer and live instrument(s) in the same way as I<br/>could for my analogue system and live instrument(s). I have problems<br/>with the visual implications of performances, but that might have<br/>changed by the time I learn how to use C sound.</p><p>But most of all I will be able to speak obscure and exotic tongues with<br/>all you programmers. Good shock value at dinner parties.</p><p>Best Wishes.</p></div><h3><a id=21754 href="#21754">ðŸ”—</a>shreeswifty &#x3C;ppagano@bellsouth.net&#x3E;</h3><span>4/28/2001 8:43:23 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>I am really beginning to enjoy this mystic quality Csound is garnering.<br/>phrases like Steep Learning Curve,   Ftable,<br/>our next punk bands?</p><p>Pat Pagano, Director<br/>South East Just Intonation Society<br/><a href="http://indians.australians.com/meherbaba/">http://indians.australians.com/meherbaba/</a><br/><a href="http://www.screwmusicforever.com/SHREESWIFT/">http://www.screwmusicforever.com/SHREESWIFT/</a></p></div><h3><a id=21755 href="#21755">ðŸ”—</a>jpehrson@rcn.com</h3><span>4/28/2001 9:02:35 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In tuning@y..., &quot;shreeswifty&quot; &lt;ppagano@b...&gt; wrote:</p><p><a href="/tuning/topicId_21751.html#21754">/tuning/topicId_21751.html#21754</a></p><p>&gt; I am really beginning to enjoy this mystic quality Csound is<br/>garnering. phrases like Steep Learning Curve,   Ftable,<br/>&gt; our next punk bands?</p><p>Swifty, I&apos;m thinking more 60&apos;s Motown...</p><p>How about &quot;The Installations...&quot;</p><p>_______ ______ ______<br/>Joseph Pehrson</p></div>
