(He&apos;s been working on it for 5 years). Nice piece.  Rather<br/>lengthy, a full-length requiem... probably 40 minutes, but interesting<br/>in that the entire chorus of 12 (6 men, 6 women) wore headsets and took<br/>their pitch cues from a laptop computer onstage.  The purpose was to<br/>create a work in just intonation... or some workable system thereof<br/>(adaptive?? whoknows).  Nice sounds of the overtone series behind the<br/>singing added, at times, to the &quot;ethereal&quot; effect.  Some people left,<br/>expecting the traditional Bang on a Can &quot;rock&quot; offerings.  Not that<br/>those type pieces have been bad... it&apos;s just that BOC seems to be<br/>expanding its &quot;palette&quot; these days, going back a bit more to the<br/>earlier times before the big Lincoln Center &quot;commercial&quot; expansion...<br/>Twining, as many list members probably know, posts here from time to<br/>time.</p><p>---</p><p>Date: Thu Jun 13, 2002  5:04 pm<br/>From:  &quot;Jonathan M.

It&apos;s an<br/>astonishing hour-long vocal work in extremely extended JI, with<br/>sometimes more than 20 (!) Johnston accidentals on each note.<br/>Incredibly complex and very beautiful, and his group recorded it (had<br/>to) by listening to a computer tape over headphones that gave them<br/>the pitches as they were singing. It&apos;s by far the most amazing tuning<br/>feat I&apos;ve ever heard in a vocal composition. The score is<br/>unbelievably complex, but the music doesn&apos;t give any hint of the<br/>amount of work. I notice there was a litle buzz on the list about the<br/>piece some months ago, but no one seems to have heard it at the time.</p><p>Cheers,</p><p>Kyle</p><p>---</p><p>Date: Fri Jan 3, 2003  8:07 pm<br/>From:  Kyle Gann &lt;kgann@e...&gt;<br/>Subject: Re: Reasons to avoid JI</p><p>Dear Gene,</p><p>&gt;Sorry, I don&apos;t play that game. I&apos;m not an<br/>&gt;advocate and I prefer not to take<br/>&gt;sides in a conflict which plainly makes no<br/>&gt;sense....</p><p>&gt;Did you get my CD? Can you explain what the big, fat difference is<br/>&gt;between the JI music, the et music, the linear temperament music<br/>&gt;and the planar temperament music on it?</p><p>Well, we&apos;re in complete agreement, which is pleasant. But you had<br/>started out by suggesting that Toby Twining&apos;s Chrysalid Requiem might<br/>be better off in ET, based only on my superficial description of it,<br/>and I thought that was too facile, as well as being dismissive of<br/>what Toby accomplished. The value of a tuning method is not only in<br/>how the music sounds, but how the process of composing it operates<br/>and feels. I&apos;m sure someone could make a version of my Custer and<br/>Sitting Bull in 31tet, or 53tet, or 7200tet, that I wouldn&apos;t be able<br/>to tell from the version I made myself. But I wouldn&apos;t have enjoyed<br/>composing it in an ET, wouldn&apos;t have come up with the same ideas,<br/>wouldn&apos;t have stumbled across the same weirdly unequal scales, nor<br/>would the resulting notation be as clear an expression of the way I<br/>conceived the music as the JI notation is. Perhaps you compose<br/>exactly the same way in ET as in JI, but for me and some people, the<br/>way the pitch space is set up has a pervasive, if subtle, impact on<br/>the way one thinks compositionally. I think Toby&apos;s score itself is an<br/>amazing achievement, and the Johnston accidentals show you not only<br/>what frequencies to play, but what harmonic relationships Toby was<br/>composing with. I haven&apos;t had the opportunity to analyze the piece<br/>yet to learn whether his accidentals &quot;accumulate&quot; because of<br/>progressive moves away from the tonic, or for some other reason.<br/>Certainly the mathematical problems you enumerated don&apos;t occur in my<br/>own music, which never keeps up a uni-directional or regular rate of<br/>harmonic change. At least, you might listen to Chrysalid Requiem<br/>before deciding that Toby did it wrong. No one who gets his music as<br/>widely performed and recorded as Toby can be considered impractical.</p><p>I don&apos;t have your CD, and I would love to get it, especially since I<br/>teach an alternative tuning course and don&apos;t have very many<br/>convincing examples of high-numbered ET music on CD. If you wouldn&apos;t<br/>mind sending me a copy, I&apos;ll e-mail you my address off-line.</p><p>Thanks,</p><p>Kyle, still snowed in with nuthin&apos; to do but get on the internet,<br/>and  not feeling sorry for Jon Szanto :^)</p><p>---</p></div>
