So I should really ask again~<br/>Would you tuning folks like to give some suggestions on how i may tune a JI<br/>violin<br/>as i am bored with my current one and will gladly accept suggestions from<br/>violinists and theorists,composers alike!</p><p>Resonate and Extenuate<br/>Pat</p><p>&quot;Jonathan M.

Szanto&quot; &lt;<a href="mailto:jszanto@adnc.com">jszanto@adnc.com</a>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Gentlemen and ladies,<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I really had no idea the Floyd I&apos;d cause by simply asking Paul to make<br/>&gt; music, which (believe it or not), I always though he did anyway -- he just<br/>&gt; doesn&apos;t talk about it much here! And it was only an example, as I<br/>&gt; occasionally through out, of how it is really *that much more satisfying*.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Occasionally.<br/>&gt; Doesn&apos;t have to be every posting.<br/>&gt; Or every week or month, even.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I frankly find *all* of the material worthwhile even when it isn&apos;t<br/>&gt; something I happen to center around. I couldn&apos;t give a flying truck about<br/>&gt; Periodicity Blocks, but other on the list do, and that - frankly - is what<br/>&gt; the list is for: matters related to alternate tunings.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Some other points:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; ~~ Paul, I&apos;ve never seen a more plainly written and personal statement from<br/>&gt; you, on your music-making. It should be clear evidence of your willingness<br/>&gt; to take the numbers into sound and form. All I hope for you is that you<br/>&gt; find both courage and conviction to move into non-12tet on a more regular<br/>&gt; basis, if only for the fact that the more of it you do the better it will<br/>&gt; become and the more worlds you&apos;ll explore (and maybe we&apos;ll get to share).<br/>&gt; And as you (Paul) said:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;  &gt;I&apos;m here to share and to learn.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;   Not that I always<br/>&gt;  &gt;know the truth, or am always right, but I&apos;ve thought and listened hard and<br/>&gt;  &gt;read widely on this stuff and sometimes I will have knowledge or a point of<br/>&gt;  &gt;view to share. I&apos;m here to share and to learn.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; ~~ To someone, somewhere, in some indigenous intonation, 12tet is an<br/>&gt; alternate tuning; I refuse to look down on someone because they play music<br/>&gt; in 12tet. Hell, that&apos;s where I make the bulk of my living, putting on the<br/>&gt; &quot;tight coat and tight shoes&quot; of the orchestral world. The only quibble I<br/>&gt; would have would be for that same person to completely dis some *other*<br/>&gt; tuning -- they all have value, somewhere, sometime.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; For those of us on the list, please keep in mind that email is<br/>&gt; excruciatingly bad at communicating tone of voice, inflection of phrases.<br/>&gt; Try not to take each comment as the end of the world, and for godesses&apos;<br/>&gt; sake, if someone asks for clarification give it, don&apos;t just write them off.<br/>&gt; This is an area that I think Paul has made progress on, as well as myself.<br/>&gt; If a comment is truly personal in nature, take it off list; everyone&apos;s<br/>&gt; address is right there in the headers, and we don&apos;t need more bandwidth<br/>&gt; wasted on personal attacks. Tuning, numbers, music. And one other thing<br/>&gt; Paul said:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;  &gt;Sometimes I am argumentative or harsh but I believe that the truth<br/>&gt;  &gt;will ultimately be more beneficial than misconceptions.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Truth is good, truth is best, but both facts and opinions can be phrased in<br/>&gt; collegial and constructive ways. You *do* have enough time in the day to be<br/>&gt; civil. As does every person on this list.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; ~~ Don&apos;t expect every question to receive an answer, at least right away:<br/>&gt; there may only be a few others on that topic and they might be away. And,<br/>&gt; for some of us that are more into music making than music theoretics, there<br/>&gt; is nothing breaking our collective arms and keeping us from posting on<br/>&gt; other topics. If the bulk of the postings are on diagrams and matrices,<br/>&gt; then it is because that is what people are posting about, while others sit<br/>&gt; on their hands.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; ~~ Oh, shit, that&apos;s enough from me. I felt duty-bound since I started this<br/>&gt; thread to respond in some manner -- it just had to come after a new hard<br/>&gt; disk install! Let&apos;s keep this an open forum, with lots of information<br/>&gt; floating around, treat everyone with respect (both as humans and<br/>&gt; colleagues), and return to the topic<br/>&gt; of ...<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; ... what?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Behave, everyone, or I won&apos;t tell you about the Harry Partch t-shirts I<br/>&gt; have for sale (again)......<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Love,<br/>&gt; Jon<br/>&gt; &grave;&apos;&grave;&apos;&grave;&apos;&grave;&apos;&grave;&apos;&grave;&apos;&grave;&apos;&grave;&apos;&grave;&apos;&grave;&apos;&grave;&apos;&grave;&apos;&grave;&apos;&grave;&apos;&grave;&apos;&grave;&apos;&grave;&apos;&grave;&apos;&grave;&apos;&grave;&apos;&grave;&apos;&grave;&apos;&grave;&apos;&grave;&apos;&grave;&apos;&grave;&apos;&grave;&apos;&grave;&apos;&grave;&apos;&grave;&apos;&grave;&apos;&grave;&apos;&grave;&apos;&grave;<br/>&gt;     Jonathan M.
