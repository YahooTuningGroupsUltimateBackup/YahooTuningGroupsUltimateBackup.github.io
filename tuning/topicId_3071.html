It took me some years to work this out, but I<br/>think it is possible to explain it and people may have an intuitive<br/>grasp of it already.  In essence the idea is that octaves (in quantities<br/>of over two anyway) are not the intervals that most nearly make notes<br/>match up as we move up the scale.

The reason that this is so (if it is agreed<br/>that it is) is that the land is not flat, but for every so many octaves<br/>the harmony actually wants a 5th thrown in.</p><p>So I would agree that a single octave is the most consonant interval,<br/>followed by a fifth and a fourth.

The 1:16 pair have dual<br/>consonance with other in between notes at 2, 4 and 8.  However a 1:24<br/>ratio has consonance with 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 12 which is much richer.

And some would agree that<br/>there is a weak tritave equivalence (or fifth equivalence) too.</p><p>&gt;If all &quot;C&quot;s are equivalent and all &quot;F&quot;s are equivalent then it doesn&apos;t<br/>&gt;matter what chord inversions we do they should be equally harmonic.<br/>&gt;However I would suggest that extended 5ths sounds better than extended<br/>&gt;4ths (say F-C-G vs G-C-F).

But of course they must<br/>all deny strict octave equivalence. Mine would be that their dissonance is<br/>dominated by the outer intervals and 9:16 is way more complex than 4:9, its<br/>proximity to 5:9 brings it down a little, but not enough to be better than<br/>4:9. And of course the inner intervals are more consonant to start with.</p><p>&gt;So I would agree that a single octave is the most consonant interval,<br/>&gt;followed by a fifth and a fourth.  This is accepted by all I think.</p><p>Yes. Provided we are talking about JI with typical harmonic timbres, and<br/>the intervals all overlap significantly in their frequency range (e.g. same<br/>upper note or same lower note or something in between. Since consonance for<br/>a given interval increases with frequency it is possible to have a high<br/>fifth which is more consonant than a low octave.</p><p>&gt;Also, a double octave is the next larger consonant interval.  However I<br/>&gt;don&apos;t think that 4 octaves is as consonant as 3 or 4 octaves plus a<br/>&gt;fifth (I guess that is technically a 26th or a 33rd :)</p><p>A 28th and a 36th I believe, but it&apos;s much easier to understand &quot;&lt;n&gt;<br/>octaves plus &lt;whatever&gt;&quot; particularly once one gets past a 13th. Or just<br/>give the ratios, 1:12 and 1:24. But I even think that one or two octaves<br/>plus a fifth (1:3, 1:6) and two octaves plus a major third (1:5) are about<br/>as consonant as any number of octaves (if the lower note is the same in<br/>every case).</p><p>&gt;As further evidence for this I want to look at two notes at a ratio of<br/>&gt;16 in comparison to another two at ratio 24.  The 1:16 pair have dual<br/>&gt;consonance with other in between notes at 2, 4 and 8.  However a 1:24<br/>&gt;ratio has consonance with 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 12 which is much richer.  In<br/>&gt;part this is due to the greater interval, but even so, a 1:12 ratio has<br/>&gt;consonance with 2, 3, 4, 6 which is better than for 1:16.</p><p>I think these reasons are spurious, but we have to be careful here. Are you<br/>talking about the dissonance of the bare dyad (interval) or are you talking<br/>about the _contribution_ of this dyad to the dissonance of various chords<br/>of which it might be a subset. There are definitely synergies occuring in<br/>some chords and not others which I think renders such a project fairly<br/>meaningless.</p><p>It&apos;s a pity you didn&apos;t join the list a few months back. We had a heavy<br/>session on formulae for dyadic dissonance (dissonance of bare intervals).<br/>I&apos;ll refer to various people below. You can find their stuff by going to<br/>&lt;<a href="http://www-math.cudenver.edu/~jstarret/microtone.html">http://www-math.cudenver.edu/~jstarret/microtone.html</a>&gt; and then to the<br/>&quot;microtonalists&quot; page and then find the persons name alphabetically.</p><p>Now dyadic dissonance has been modelled very well by Bill Sethares using<br/>calculations which take the Fourier transform of the tones involved and sum<br/>the contribution of every pair of frequencies to the overall dissonance,<br/>based on an experimentally determined dissonance curve for a pair of sines.<br/>This even works for non-harmonic timbres and partly works for more than two<br/>notes.</p><p>But this is not the sort of calculation you can do in your head. What we<br/>wanted was a simple formula that gave a reasonable approximation for<br/>typical harmonic timbres.</p><p>We broke the dyadic dissonance down into three components called<br/>COMPLEXITY, TOLERANCE and SPAN. COMPLEXITY relates to the size of the<br/>numbers in the ratio and gives the dissonance for dyads that are both<br/>simple and narrow, under certain conditions, TOLERANCE refers to the<br/>consonance of very complex dyads due to their nearness to simpler ones, and<br/>SPAN refers to the consonance of very wide dyads despite their complexity.</p><p>We compared our experience (and some deliberate experiments) with about 18<br/>different COMPLEXITY formulae. We came to a reasonably strong consensus<br/>that prime factorisation was a red herring in this regard. At least two of<br/>us started out supporting a weighted prime exponent scheme but changed our<br/>tune by the end. What we came up with was that for a typical harmonic<br/>timbre, dyads that can be represented as a ratio x:y in lowest terms, where<br/>x+y &lt; 17, have relative dissonances given by the following formulae in the<br/>following cases:<br/>When the dyads all have their<br/>  lowest note the same     Min(x,y)<br/>  highest note the same    Max(x,y)<br/>  mean frequency the same  (x+y)/2<br/>  mean pitch the same      sqrt(x*y)</p><p>The first two have also been less accurately called &quot;numerator&quot; and<br/>&quot;denominator&quot; respectively, based on a convention that considers the ratio<br/>to be always a fraction greater than one. But note that musical interval<br/>ratios are really unordered, so x:y = y:x.</p><p>It is tempting to conclude from the above formulae that the dissonance is<br/>given by the period of the virtual fundamental, but this only works when<br/>the dyads being compared are in the same frequency range. Consider a fifth<br/>versus an octave where the high note of the octave is the same as the low<br/>note of the fifth. I don&apos;t think anyone finds these to have the same<br/>dissonance, although they have the same virtual fundamental.</p><p>Note that the above conditions ensure that one dyad fits inside the span of<br/>the other. Unfortunately we haven&apos;t yet considered how to compare the<br/>dissonance of dyads not having a significant part of their span in common.</p><p>Obviously the x+y &lt; 17 is not a sharp cutoff. It might be pushed to 19 for<br/>a timbre rich in higher harmonics or lowered to 13 for one weak in higher<br/>harmonics.</p><p>The reason for having any cutoff at all, is that the ear-brain system has a<br/>pitch error TOLERANCE. Clearly a ratio of 1000:2001 sounds pretty much as<br/>consonant as an octave. But even a ratio like 8:13 is slightly less<br/>dissonant than expected from its COMPLEXITY, due to its proximity to 3:5<br/>and 5:8. Experiments have shown this tolerance to be a bell curve with a<br/>standard deviation of about 1% (17 cents) in the midrange. Here&apos;s a rough<br/>justification of the x+y &lt; 17 cuttoff. The difference between the major and<br/>minor whole tones 8:9 and 9:10 is 21.5c, the familiar syntonic comma, not<br/>much more than one standard deviation, and these two intervals don&apos;t seem<br/>to have a dissonance hump between them. Now 8+9 = 17 and 9+10 = 19.</p><p>Paul Erlich has found a way to combine some simple COMPLEXITY measures with<br/>TOLERANCE to give curves very similar to those of Sethares, although he<br/>tends to assume octave equivalence. He calls this Harmonic Entropy.</p><p>With regard to SPAN, some say that very wide intervals are neither<br/>consonant nor dissonant. I prefer to stick to talking about degrees of<br/>dissonance (rather than consonance) since we can all agree that wide<br/>intervals are not dissonant. Maybe we need a term &quot;asonant&quot;.</p><p>The really hard part is dealing with more than two notes. More about this<br/>later.</p><p>&gt;I suggest in fact that for about every 4.5 octaves a shift of a fifth is<br/>&gt;required for the greatest consonance - F0 F1 F2 F3 C4 C5 C6 C7 G7 G8 G9.</p><p>I would say that with the lowest note kept constant, the following<br/>intervals are all roughly equally consonant 1:2, 1:3, 1:4, 1:5, 1:6, etc.</p><p>&gt;The full formula for this is that ratios of 2, 3, 5, 7 etc should occur<br/>&gt;in inverse proportion to p*ln(p) which gives relative proportions of<br/>&gt;100, 42, 17, 10 etc. and creates the pattern of relationships shown in<br/>&gt;<a href="http://www.kcbbs.gen.nz/users/rtomes/rt-ha-nm.gif">http://www.kcbbs.gen.nz/users/rtomes/rt-ha-nm.gif</a> where the taller lines<br/>&gt;are at the harmonic numbers that have the greatest consonance with 1.</p><p>I don&apos;t understand the relevance of 4 and 5 digit harmonic numbers to<br/>music. Where does the p*ln(p) prime weighting come from? How does it relate<br/>to human psycho-acoustics? I have to admit to being highly skeptical of any<br/>scheme for modelling the subjective human experience of dissonance that<br/>also claims to explain the structure of the universe!</p><p>Can you give the complete formula for your proposed complexity (or<br/>dissonance) metric for a ratio x:y, assuming that x:y is in lowest terms<br/>and that x = 2^a * 3^b * 5^c * 7^d * ... and y = 2^A * 3^B * 5^C * 7^D *<br/>... or some such. I&apos;ll include it with the other 18 formulae in my Harmonic<br/>Complexity metrics spreadsheet (on my website).</p><p>&gt;The reason that I raise all of this is that when the best ratios are<br/>&gt;being sought (based on the previous chords etc) for any given note<br/>&gt;played, we cannot ignore which octave it is played in.  If a given note<br/>&gt;is in a higher octave then it is more acceptable to have an additional<br/>&gt;ratio of a higher prime (in the numerator) than it is if the same note<br/>&gt;is in a lower octave.</p><p>I would agree with this if &quot;prime&quot; was changed to simply &quot;whole number&quot;,<br/>but not for the reasons you give.

However, if the fundamental is<br/>something much lower, perhaps 1 oscillation per 3 seconds or less, then<br/>these harmonics will be what occupies the interesting part of the<br/>hearing range.</p><p>Sidetrack for a moment.  I put the 1 per 3 seconds figure because that<br/>is the typical rate of breathing for a walking person.  If all the most<br/>closely related harmonics of 1/3 Hz are played then it might well be<br/>that it has some power to entrain a person&apos;s breath (or heart or brain<br/>or whatever).  I am plotting to make music do more than just give the<br/>emotions a little prod.   :-)</p><p>Additional sidetrack.  One of the ways that music works on the emotions<br/>is through the implied fundamentals of chords hitting resonances within<br/>the human body and mind.  We have these things which the Indians call<br/>chakras which are located at close to 1/12s of the way up the human body<br/>and therefore one falls between the legs (1/2 way) and one in the heart<br/>(3/4 way) and so on.  These chakra are supposed to be associated with<br/>various emotions and attributes of humans and so hitting chords and<br/>sequences that activate these can set off emotions.  The fundamental<br/>waves of the human body are ~1/3 Hz breathing but varies with bodily<br/>activity, ~1 Hz heart likewise, ~8 Hz brain which varies with type of<br/>mental activity.  There are interconnections between these and the<br/>chakras also.  It seems that the frequencies which activate chakras may<br/>be in these ELF (extra Low Frequency) range rather than in the hearing<br/>range.  They are therefore mainly activated by rhythm and implied<br/>fundamentals.</p><p>So to return to the 4 and 5 digit harmonics.  If we want all the<br/>relationships to many notes starting from the fundamental then the<br/>initial pattern of numbers that you see at the low end is probably<br/>pretty much what you would expect.  What happens then is that each<br/>higher harmonic is considered in relationship to all the existing ones,<br/>taking account of things something like your span etc above.  Through<br/>this process the whole pattern is developed.</p><p>&gt;Where does the p*ln(p) prime weighting come from?</p><p>When the calculations are done for the harmonics the relationship of<br/>every note to every other is taken as follows:</p><p>note relates to notes<br/>1 --&gt; 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 etc<br/>2 --&gt;     4   6   8   10    12    etc<br/>3 --&gt;         6     9       12<br/>4 --&gt;             8         12<br/>5 --&gt;                 10<br/>6 --&gt;                       12    etc etc etc</p><p>and that is how the pattern develops.  On this basis the strongest<br/>harmonics in the 48 to 96 range are 48,60,72, 96 or a major chord and<br/>the next strongest 48,54,56,60,64,72,80,84,90,96 which is the just<br/>intonation scale plus Eb and Bb if we are in C.  On this basis 34560 is<br/>the strongest relationship.</p><p>When the above pattern is calculated out to high numbers then the ones<br/>with the most ways of being produced (for the size of the harmonic -<br/>since the numbers go up rapidly anyway) turn out to be 1 2 4 12 24 48<br/>144 288 1440 2880 5760 17280 34560 69120 etc.  On this basis 34560 is<br/>the strongest relationship.  These numbers have ratios between adjacent<br/>numbers of 2 2 3 2 2 3 2 5 2 2 3 2 2 etc and in this series the numbers<br/>appear with frequency 1/(p*ln(p)).</p><p>&gt;How does it relate to human psycho-acoustics?</p><p>I assume that it must because human music has so many features that are<br/>totally consistent with the results from my harmonics calculations.  I<br/>mentioned the major chord and just intonation scale above.  Minor, Blues<br/>and Indian music scales are also found. Additions of the predicted<br/>strong harmonics also develop all the main rhythms.  As well as that it<br/>seems to fit the stucture of the universe of which we are children.</p><p>&gt;I have to admit to being highly skeptical of any<br/>&gt;scheme for modelling the subjective human experience of dissonance that<br/>&gt;also claims to explain the structure of the universe!</p><p>Fine, be skeptical, but check it out.</p><p>&gt;Can you give the complete formula for your proposed complexity (or<br/>&gt;dissonance) metric for a ratio x:y, assuming that x:y is in lowest terms<br/>&gt;and that x = 2^a * 3^b * 5^c * 7^d * ... and y = 2^A * 3^B * 5^C * 7^D *<br/>&gt;... or some such. I&apos;ll include it with the other 18 formulae in my Harmonic<br/>&gt;Complexity metrics spreadsheet (on my website).</p><p>Well it depends on where the x:y is within the structure (unless we<br/>interpret it as absolute x and y which I think would be a mistake).<br/>I recently posted that I was trying to solve this one with a slightly<br/>new perspective - as yet incomplete.</p><p>I can give an average value based on different a set of octaves picked<br/>from various parts of the harmonic pattern.  I hope to soon produce a<br/>set of graphics with these selections so that you can see how they vary<br/>slightly as we move along the pattern.  Briefly though, at the low end<br/>2 and 3 ratios are more important (pythagorean) but quickly the 5s make<br/>a showing (galilean) and higher up the 7s (blues).  Eventually 11, 13<br/>and the others come in.  From the size of the universe it takes all the<br/>way to the size of an electron and proton for 17 to appear in the e/p<br/>mass ratio of 1:1836 (2*2*3*3*17) and 19 and 23 appear in accelerator<br/>created particles mass ratios.  Note that masses are the same as<br/>frequencies according to Planck&apos;s and Einstein&apos;s laws E=hf and E=mc^2.</p><p>-- Ray Tomes -- <a href="http://www.kcbbs.gen.nz/users/rtomes/rt-home.htm">http://www.kcbbs.gen.nz/users/rtomes/rt-home.htm</a> --<br/>   Cycles email list -- <a href="http://www.kcbbs.gen.nz/users/af/cyc.htm">http://www.kcbbs.gen.nz/users/af/cyc.htm</a><br/>Alexandria eGroup list -- <a href="http://www.kcbbs.gen.nz/users/af/alex.htm">http://www.kcbbs.gen.nz/users/af/alex.htm</a><br/>Boundaries of Science <a href="http://www.kcbbs.gen.nz/users/af/scienceb.htm">http://www.kcbbs.gen.nz/users/af/scienceb.htm</a></p></div><h3><a id=3138 href="#3138">ðŸ”—</a>Dave Keenan &#x3C;d.keenan@xx.xxx.xxx&#x3E;</h3><span>5/18/1999 8:51:21 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>[Ray Tomes TD 187.4]<br/>&gt;One of us ran out of fingers and toes but I think it was you  :)<br/>&gt;You have to take 7*(3 or 4)+5 I think.</p><p>Oh yeah.

So you are not really talking about the consonance/dissonance of the<br/>pair of notes but rather something I will call their harmonic fecundity or<br/>gregariousness. i.e. their potential for forming relatively consonant<br/>groups with other notes. This is a very useful thing to quantify but you<br/>seem to have been confusing it with how the two notes sound together. The<br/>two are not related. Prime factorisation is definitely relevant to the<br/>former but irrelevant to the latter (except in so far as it aids in<br/>reducing a ratio to lowest terms). The latter depends only on the _size_ of<br/>the numbers involved in the lowest-terms ratio, not their further<br/>factorisations. This is demonstrated by the fact that 8:9 is not more<br/>consonant than 7:8, nor is 15:8 more consonant than 13:7.</p><p>&gt;In that case my argument depends on the ability to combine with as yet<br/>&gt;unspecified third and fourth notes etc.</p><p>Yes.</p><p>...<br/>&gt;Sidetrack for a moment.  I put the 1 per 3 seconds figure because that<br/>&gt;is the typical rate of breathing for a walking person.  If all the most<br/>&gt;closely related harmonics of 1/3 Hz are played then it might well be<br/>&gt;that it has some power to entrain a person&apos;s breath (or heart or brain<br/>&gt;or whatever).  I am plotting to make music do more than just give the<br/>&gt;emotions a little prod.   :-)</p><p>It _may_ be. But I&apos;d wan&apos;t some evidence before I bothered trying to<br/>musically use virtual fundamentals significantly below the range of human<br/>hearing.</p><p>&gt;Additional sidetrack.  One of the ways that music works on the emotions<br/>&gt;is through the implied fundamentals of chords hitting resonances within<br/>&gt;the human body and mind.</p><p>Mind yes, body no. The ear-brain responds in some ways the same as it would<br/>if the virtual/implied fundamental were really there, but it does not<br/>constitute air vibrations at that frequency and so is not capable of<br/>exciting mechanical resonances in body parts.</p><p>&gt;We have these things which the Indians call<br/>&gt;chakras which are located at close to 1/12s of the way up the human body<br/>&gt;and therefore one falls between the legs (1/2 way) and one in the heart<br/>&gt;(3/4 way) and so on.  These chakra are supposed to be associated with<br/>&gt;various emotions and attributes of humans and so hitting chords and<br/>&gt;sequences that activate these can set off emotions.  The fundamental<br/>&gt;waves of the human body are ~1/3 Hz breathing but varies with bodily<br/>&gt;activity, ~1 Hz heart likewise, ~8 Hz brain which varies with type of<br/>&gt;mental activity.  There are interconnections between these and the<br/>&gt;chakras also.  It seems that the frequencies which activate chakras may<br/>&gt;be in these ELF (extra Low Frequency) range rather than in the hearing<br/>&gt;range.  They are therefore mainly activated by rhythm and implied<br/>&gt;fundamentals.</p><p>I haven&apos;t personally seen any scientifically respectable evidence of the<br/>validity of chakra theory, and I think you&apos;ve got it somewhat garbled<br/>anyway, but we don&apos;t need to invoke chakras to establish that various<br/>aspects of music trigger various emotions. As for body resonances, rhythm<br/>yes, low audio frequencies yes, subsonics yes, implied fundamentals no<br/>(irrespective of their frequency).</p><p>You could very easily perform an experiment for yourself that would prove<br/>this. Take a high Q mechanically resonant system, say an A440 tuning fork,<br/>and play a chord having 440Hz as its virtual fundamental but not containing<br/>440Hz. To avoid affects of startup and stopping transients ramp the<br/>amplitude up gradually then down gradually and see iff the tuning fork is<br/>ringing. Of course a small amount of actual 440Hz will be generated by<br/>non-linearities (primarily in the speakers), so compare it to the case when<br/>you actually play 440Hz.</p><p>Alternatively you could use a 1Hz pendulum and play a pair of audio tones<br/>1Hz apart. There&apos;s very little chance that the speakers can generate any<br/>actual 1Hz through nonlinearities, and the result (or lack thereof) will be<br/>visible even while you are playing the tones.</p><p>...<br/>&gt;&gt;Where does the p*ln(p) prime weighting come from?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;When the calculations are done for the harmonics the relationship of<br/>&gt;every note to every other is taken as follows:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;note relates to notes<br/>&gt;1 --&gt; 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 etc<br/>&gt;2 --&gt;     4   6   8   10    12    etc<br/>&gt;3 --&gt;         6     9       12<br/>&gt;4 --&gt;             8         12<br/>&gt;5 --&gt;                 10<br/>&gt;6 --&gt;                       12    etc etc etc<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;and that is how the pattern develops.  On this basis the strongest<br/>&gt;harmonics in the 48 to 96 range are 48,60,72, 96 or a major chord and<br/>&gt;the next strongest 48,54,56,60,64,72,80,84,90,96 which is the just<br/>&gt;intonation scale plus Eb and Bb if we are in C.  On this basis 34560 is<br/>&gt;the strongest relationship.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;When the above pattern is calculated out to high numbers then the ones<br/>&gt;with the most ways of being produced (for the size of the harmonic -<br/>&gt;since the numbers go up rapidly anyway) turn out to be 1 2 4 12 24 48<br/>&gt;144 288 1440 2880 5760 17280 34560 69120 etc.  On this basis 34560 is<br/>&gt;the strongest relationship.  These numbers have ratios between adjacent<br/>&gt;numbers of 2 2 3 2 2 3 2 5 2 2 3 2 2 etc and in this series the numbers<br/>&gt;appear with frequency 1/(p*ln(p)).</p><p>Aha! This makes sense now. This is not a way of determining relative<br/>consonance of intervals or chords, but it may well be a very interesting<br/>and useful way of finding Just scales that maximise the number of _otonal_<br/>chords for a limited number of notes. But I&apos;m not sure it&apos;s clear to<br/>everyone yet (me included) how to use it for that purpose or why it works.</p><p>The way that many on this list have been looking for such scales<br/>previously, is by drawing graphs (or networks) of the consonant<br/>relationships (that we&apos;ve been calling lattices) in such a way that the<br/>most consonant chords form highly symmetrical polyhedra and so stand out<br/>for the human visual system.</p><p>As you have now recognised, your method ignores utonal chords, mixed<br/>o/u-tonal (ASSs) and inconsistent (contradictory/necesarily tempered)<br/>chords. Whereas our lattices make the opposite mistake of according utonal<br/>equal status to otonal. But lattices merely give less importance to the<br/>last two types rather than ignoring them completely.</p><p>&gt;&gt;How does it relate to human psycho-acoustics?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;I assume that it must because human music has so many features that are<br/>&gt;totally consistent with the results from my harmonics calculations.  I<br/>&gt;mentioned the major chord and just intonation scale above.  Minor, Blues<br/>&gt;and Indian music scales are also found.<br/>...</p><p>It&apos;s gotta be because your method maximises the number of small whole<br/>number ratios available, weighted towards the lowest numbers in a very good<br/>way. And for humans lower numbers = greater consonance.</p><p>...<br/>&gt;&gt;Can you give the complete formula for your proposed complexity (or<br/>&gt;&gt;dissonance) metric ...<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;Well it depends on where the x:y is within the structure (unless we<br/>&gt;interpret it as absolute x and y which I think would be a mistake).<br/>&gt;I recently posted that I was trying to solve this one with a slightly<br/>&gt;new perspective - as yet incomplete.</p><p>Yes but how x:y sounds doesn&apos;t depend on what other notes are available in<br/>the scale. So again, this establishes that you are not talking about a<br/>consonance/dissonance metric for intervals or chords. But a harmonic<br/>usefulness (fecundity?) metric for scales.</p><p>...<br/>&gt; Briefly though, at the low end<br/>&gt;2 and 3 ratios are more important (pythagorean) but quickly the 5s make<br/>&gt;a showing (galilean) and higher up the 7s (blues).  Eventually 11, 13<br/>&gt;and the others come in.</p><p>Fine. Most people accept that. Except I don&apos;t know what Galileo had to do<br/>with 5-limit.</p><p>&gt; From the size of the universe it takes all the<br/>&gt;way to the size of an electron and proton for 17 to appear in the e/p<br/>&gt;mass ratio of 1:1836 (2*2*3*3*17) and 19 and 23 appear in accelerator<br/>&gt;created particles mass ratios.  Note that masses are the same as<br/>&gt;frequencies according to Planck&apos;s and Einstein&apos;s laws E=hf and E=mc^2.</p><p>Aw c&apos;mon Ray.

But I&apos;d wan&apos;t some evidence before I bothered trying to<br/>&gt;musically use virtual fundamentals significantly below the range of human<br/>&gt;hearing.</p><p>There is a fellow called Ed Wagner who measures waves in trees which<br/>travel at just under 1 m/s and similar waves I believe exist in humans<br/>(as well as faster nerve waves).  Interestingly, a 1 m/s wave takes<br/>about 3.5 seconds to bounce between our head and feet and back again -<br/>an amount of time which is close to our normal breathing rate.</p><p>Rhythms which are near multiples of this rate (of about 17 bpm, but<br/>varying with height) will establish a standing wave pattern in a person.<br/>If energy concentrations occur at certain locations in the body then<br/>various organs can be affected and can affect moods.</p><p>&gt;Mind yes, body no.

It is not standard theory but my<br/>suggestion that standing waves are involved.  Let me suggest that you do<br/>the measurements for this.  Take your height and divide by two and<br/>measure where that is in your body (it is where the base of the spine<br/>and sex chakras are).  The divide the top half in two again and you get<br/>the heart.  Divide the top again and you get the throat and the next<br/>half is between the eyes.</p><p>&gt;but we don&apos;t need to invoke chakras to establish that various<br/>&gt;aspects of music trigger various emotions. As for body resonances, rhythm<br/>&gt;yes, low audio frequencies yes, subsonics yes, implied fundamentals no<br/>&gt;(irrespective of their frequency).</p><p>If you look at any chord then the implied fundamental is the frequency<br/>at which a single regular location in the wave is not moving.</p><p>&gt;You could very easily perform an experiment for yourself that would prove<br/>&gt;this.

It is probably highly<br/>non-linear.</p><p>&gt;Aha! This makes sense now.

It does give a set of values which have the maximum<br/>possible number of relationships.</p><p>&gt;The way that many on this list have been looking for such scales<br/>&gt;previously, is by drawing graphs (or networks) of the consonant<br/>&gt;relationships (that we&apos;ve been calling lattices) in such a way that the<br/>&gt;most consonant chords form highly symmetrical polyhedra and so stand out<br/>&gt;for the human visual system.</p><p>However there is no reason in these networks to stop after some number<br/>of powers of each prime.  There is no reason for the higher number of<br/>powers of 2 and 3 allowed and so on.  The harmonics theory makes clear<br/>exactly how important (relatively) each harmonic is.  There are no<br/>arbitrary assumptions and it all comes out.</p><p>&gt;As you have now recognised, your method ignores utonal chords, mixed<br/>&gt;o/u-tonal (ASSs) and inconsistent (contradictory/necesarily tempered)<br/>&gt;chords.

Surely you know that these constants have been measured to<br/>&gt;extreme accuracy and none of them are integers. Proton-electron mass ratio<br/>&gt;is ... 1836.152701 with a standard uncertainty of .000037. Does the universe<br/>&gt;use temperaments then?</p><p>Yes, you have got it (OK, I know that you were being cheeky but you did<br/>get it right).  I gave the same answer to another question.  Look at the<br/>masses of H, He etc and you find 1.008, 4.004 which is not exactly 4<br/>times as much.  The reason is that there are always small other energies<br/>involved which are called binding energies or other terms.  If you doubt<br/>that the 1836 ratio is real then consider this.  Take a mass of 68 times<br/>and electron.  This divides 27 times (almost exactly) into a proton or<br/>neutron mass.  It so happens that it also divides accurately 3 times<br/>into the muon mass, 4 times into the pion mass and very close to an<br/>integer times into many other particles.  The small variations from<br/>integers are no more significant than the same variations for isotopes<br/>which are accepted as being whole numbers of nucleons.  What is more I<br/>used this plus other information in 1994 to publicly predict that there<br/>must exist a particle of mass 68 times an electron.  Such a particle was<br/>discovered in 1995.  That is the true test.</p><p>-- Ray Tomes -- <a href="http://www.kcbbs.gen.nz/users/rtomes/rt-home.htm">http://www.kcbbs.gen.nz/users/rtomes/rt-home.htm</a> --<br/>   Cycles email list -- <a href="http://www.kcbbs.gen.nz/users/af/cyc.htm">http://www.kcbbs.gen.nz/users/af/cyc.htm</a><br/>Alexandria eGroup list -- <a href="http://www.kcbbs.gen.nz/users/af/alex.htm">http://www.kcbbs.gen.nz/users/af/alex.htm</a><br/>Boundaries of Science <a href="http://www.kcbbs.gen.nz/users/af/scienceb.htm">http://www.kcbbs.gen.nz/users/af/scienceb.htm</a></p></div>
