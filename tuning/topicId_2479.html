Unfortunately, factoring large numbers is<br/>not trivial.  Fortunately there is an easy way to get around that, Euclid&apos;s<br/>Algorithm.  Euclid&apos;s algorithm really only finds the greatest common divisor,<br/>but if you know the greatest common divisor, then you can find the least<br/>common multiple.  I&apos;ll use Euclid&apos;s Algorithm to find the least common<br/>multiple between 144 and 80.</p><p>Euclid&apos;s algorithm consists of finding the remainder between two numbers over<br/>and over again until you get to a remainder of 0.</p><p>144 divided by 80 = 1 with a remainder of 64.</p><p>We could also say:</p><p>144 mod 80 = 64</p><p>The whole algorithm:</p><p>144 mod 80=64<br/>80 mod 64=16<br/>16 mod 64=0</p><p>Now we know that the greatest common divisor between 144 and 80 is 16,<br/>therefore the least common multiple is 144*80/16, or 720.  We can check with<br/>the factoring method.</p><p>144=2^4*3^2<br/>80=2^4*5</p><p>LCM=2^4*3^2*5=720</p><p>Also to clarify how the &quot;lattice&quot; function in the Aliq program works.  I&apos;ll<br/>explain using an example.</p><p>6 9<br/>5 8<br/>4 6</p><p>The fundamental of the scale is obtained by multiplying the bottom elements<br/>of the chords: 4*6=24.  All other numbers are octave adjusted to be in the<br/>octave defined by this number. The next step is to multiply all the elements<br/>of each chord with every element of every other chord.  In this case those<br/>products would be 4*8=32, 4*9=36, 5*6=30, 5*8=40, 5*9=45, 6*6=36, 6*8=48,<br/>6*9=54.</p><p>Since the 48 is merely the octave, it is discarded.  The duplicate 36 is<br/>removed.  Since the 54 is greater than 48, the octave limit, it is divide by<br/>two and becomes 27.</p><p>The scale:</p><p>LCM:  4,320</p><p>7&#x9;45&#x9;15/8<br/>6&#x9;40&#x9;5/3<br/>5&#x9;36&#x9;3/2<br/>4&#x9;32&#x9;4/3<br/>3&#x9;30&#x9;5/4<br/>2&#x9;27&#x9;9/8<br/>1&#x9;24&#x9;1/1</p><p>I started using this method back when I was trying to design frequency<br/>divider networks using a minimum of parts back in the late 60&apos;s.  I came up<br/>with a complete 7-tone musical instrument that did major and minor and had<br/>automatic harmony and used only 32 flip-flops. Sometime in the early 80&apos;s we<br/>had samples of a custom integrated circuit made but were never able to get it<br/>into production.  It was these instruments, called Holophones, which led to<br/>my discussions with Wurlitzer.  The chip had a single channel frequency<br/>divider that did chord modulation, and a three-channel divider that could be<br/>switched between major and minor.</p><p>Marion.</p></div>
