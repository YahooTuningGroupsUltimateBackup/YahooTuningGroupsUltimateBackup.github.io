It takes<br/>some care to describe how the two types of numbers<br/>work with each other.</p><p>However this is no more tricky really<br/>than explaining how you can do calculations<br/>using numbers with infinitely many decimal<br/>places, which is what conventional maths<br/>is based on.

Easy to explain how to work with finite<br/>decimals but not so easy to explain how infinite<br/>decimals work and what you can do with them.<br/>We don&apos;t usually need to do that kind of thing<br/>in daily life - unless you are a mathematican<br/>perhaps.</p><p>The way it works is that instead of building<br/>an infinite decimal expansion outwards,<br/>you group together the non standard ratios<br/>into equivalence classes, by saying that the ones that<br/>are within an &quot;infinitesimal&quot; of each other<br/>are identical.</p><p>Anyway to take a more practical example,<br/>I discovered while programaming FTS that<br/>one degree of 19-et (i.e. the nineteenth<br/>root of two) is very close to<br/>a rational number.</p><p>2^(1/19)      = 1.0371550444461919<br/>419914/404871 = 1.0371550444463</p><p>I wonder if this is the closest one<br/>can get to an equal temperament<br/>note with, say, a ratio involving<br/>only twelve digits in total,<br/>as we have it here?</p><p>One thing I&apos;ve wondered is if you<br/>can get this close to an n-et note<br/>using a ratio that is factorisable completely<br/>into primes less than, say, 50.<br/>If it can be done, it is certainly<br/>fairly rare.</p><p>It would be quite easy to program<br/>such a search actually - go through all<br/>the n-ets up to say 100 or something<br/>(most interesting for small ones)<br/>and for each one check to find the<br/>closest 50 limit ratios for all the<br/>scale degrees - not a particularly<br/>efficient way of doing it but a modern<br/>computer would be fast enough to do that<br/>so there wouldn&apos;t be that much incentive<br/>to speed up the algorithm.

If one forms an 13 MOS of this interval you end up with a close interval with<br/>the 12 ET semitone. Iy has made me wonder if all that circus music might be drawing upon this<br/>interpretation of this interval.

In fact isn&apos;t this<br/>close to one revolution of the Milky way? or am i about 400 million short?</p><p>One thing that has not been mentioned in there are assumption to JI that have not been touched<br/>upon and that is that the ratios will be used in certain ways and that lattices and this has been<br/>the practice so far. So while it is possible for some JI user to use 419914/404871 such an<br/>interval would be reached by the simpler intervals in between.<br/>    Lou Harrison mentioned that JI has only examined half of it universe in that it has been scale<br/>oriented as opposed to interval oriented. In the latter we would have a scale of intervals at hand<br/>regardless of weather it forms a cohesive whole or not. This for me is out of my interest in that<br/>i find expression in such structures that the intervals outline out.<br/>It seems possible to have an array of different ET scales or intervals or a matrix of any<br/>Irrationals from which to proceed through the continuum</p><p>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Robert<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;</p><p>-- Kraig Grady<br/>North American Embassy of Anaphoria island<br/> <a href="http://www.anaphoria.com">http://www.anaphoria.com</a></p><p>The Wandering Medicine Show<br/>Wed. 8-9 KXLU 88.9 fm</p></div><h3><a id=38098 href="#38098">ðŸ”—</a>gdsecor &#x3C;gdsecor@yahoo.com&#x3E;</h3><span>6/21/2002 8:55:46 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In tuning@y..., &quot;Robert Walker&quot; &lt;robertwalker@n...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; ...

Please<br/>note, I&apos;m just stating a few things here not in direct response<br/>to you, George, but to expand on thoughts. Anyway, the point is,<br/>my initial idea is that scales not consisting solely of rational<br/>(harmonic) intervals may be labelled as &quot;inharmonic&quot;<br/>(irrational). My instinct is not to use &quot;rational scale&quot; or<br/>&quot;irrational scale&quot; to avoid suggestions of ideology, however<br/>vague, similar to the labelling of intervals and scales as<br/>&quot;Just&quot;. Plus, I think &quot;harmonic&quot; and &quot;inharmonic&quot; would more apt<br/>in musical use.</p><p>Before anyone misconstructs this in a hurry, let me clarify:</p><p>I am not confusing &quot;harmonic&quot; and &quot;inharmonic&quot; with &quot;consonance&quot;<br/>and &quot;dissonance&quot;. I&apos;m working with ref. again to the OED:</p><p>&quot;harmonic: adj. 2 Mus. b (of a tone) produced by vibration of a<br/>string etc. in an exact fraction of its length.&quot;</p><p>&quot;inharmonic: adj. esp. Mus.  not harmonic.&quot;</p><p>&gt; Yes, there are temperaments that are so accurate that they are, for<br/>&gt; all practical purposes, indistinguishable from JI (e.g., the 1/8-<br/>&gt; schisma Helmholtzian temperament or its even more precise 1/9-schisma<br/>&gt; variant), but they are still temperaments.  And, yes, such a<br/>&gt; temperament will be closer to exact JI than the very best efforts of<br/>&gt; singers or musicians to perform a composition accurately in JI.  And<br/>&gt; who can argue but that the *intent* of the temperament and of the<br/>&gt; performer is exactly the same: to produce accurate *representations*<br/>&gt; (i.e., approximations) of rational intervals.</p><p>&gt; However, we could save ourselves a lot of grief by calling these low-<br/>&gt; error temperaments &quot;near-just&quot; tunings or temperaments and refraining<br/>&gt; from misrepresenting them as &quot;just intonation&quot;, because, by<br/>&gt; definition, they aren&apos;t JI.</p><p>&quot;Low-error&quot; (for their intended purpose) temperaments are (or<br/>should be), by design, just that. However, there is something to<br/>what you propose, but it&apos;s not quite so simple.</p><p>&gt;  And using six-digit rational ratios to<br/>&gt; represent an interval in some ET isn&apos;t going to make that a JI<br/>&gt; interval -- it&apos;s not a consonance that falls within anyone&apos;s intended<br/>&gt; harmonic limit.</p><p>This is subjective.

Dunne). See above for my<br/>thoughts on &quot;consonance&quot;.</p><p>&gt; May I suggest that (taking 72-ET as a point of departure) only<br/>&gt; temperaments having an error less than 4 cents for all of the<br/>&gt; consonances being represented within the specified harmonic limit<br/>&gt; (and less than 2 cents for 2:3 and 3:4) be designated &quot;near-just&quot;?<br/>&gt;</p><p>Interesting, but personally don&apos;t see it as a good idea if used<br/>with a broad stroke, especially not for equal-intervalled<br/>scales.

How many here have played<br/>&gt; microtonal music to an unsuspecting lab rat, uh I mean friend,<br/>&gt; to have her/him say it&apos;s &quot;out of tune&quot; ?</p><p>In rational intervals consonance is closely correlated with the size<br/>of the numbers in the ratio -- the larger the numbers, the less<br/>consonant the interval -- so long as the interval doesn&apos;t lose its<br/>identity and start sounding like an approximation of some lower-<br/>numbered ratio.  There is some subjectivity, but it involves:</p><p>1) At what point (or p-harmonic limit) one no longer recognizes<br/>intervals as consonant; and</p><p>2) At what point one no longer recognizes intervals as having<br/>distinct identities.</p><p>Regarding one&apos;s unsuspecting friends: one of the challenges of<br/>writing a microtonal composition is to use new intervals without<br/>making the result sound as if it is out of tune.  The problem is<br/>greatest when using temperaments in which the intervals have large<br/>errors, which is a good rationale for the employment of JI or near-<br/>just temperaments.</p><p>&gt; &gt; There is some point, however, at which a harmonic limit can be so<br/>&gt; &gt; high as to be meaningless.  I think that I can safely conclude<br/>that<br/>&gt; &gt; you have exceeded it.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; But, one may be thinking simply in terms of the harmonics series<br/>&gt; with no sense or need for a &quot;limit&quot;.</p><p>Then one has failed to recognize that the extent to which a harmonic<br/>limit may be successfully employed is not unlimited.</p><p>&gt; &gt; 2)  Ratio<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; Any tuning in which a rational interval (no matter how small)<br/>&gt; &gt; vanishes is by definition a temperament, not a rational tuning.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; This is partly correct. First it is scales we&apos;re concerned in<br/>&gt; this instance, not tunings. One tunes *to* a scale. Second, a<br/>&gt; scale consisting of non-rational intervals is *not* &quot;by<br/>&gt; definition&quot; a temperament. It may just be someone&apos;s (perfectly<br/>&gt; valid) notion of a nice sounding bunch of notes. Plus, the<br/>&gt; meaning of temperament in a musical context is (mostly) clearly<br/>&gt; defined, i.e., as stated by the OED, &quot;an adjustment of intervals<br/>&gt; in tuning a piano etc. so as to fit the scale for use in all<br/>&gt; keys&quot;.</p><p>Where was it that we were talking about scales?</p><p>In stating that temperaments are non-rational tunings, one would not<br/>logically conclude that all non-rational tunings are temperments.<br/>The essence of a temperament is to represent two rational intervals<br/>by a single (tempered) interval that serves as an approximation for<br/>either or both; the difference between the two rational intervals is<br/>called a comma, which vanishes in that temperament.  This is not in<br/>conflict with the OED definition you gave, although it is a bit<br/>broader.</p><p>&gt; The human brain, marvel that it is, finds inharmonic intervals<br/>&gt; interesting &amp; appealing, so non-rational intervals are<br/>&gt; completely validated (&quot;justified&quot; ?!) in their existence. Please<br/>&gt; note, I&apos;m just stating a few things here not in direct response<br/>&gt; to you, George, but to expand on thoughts. Anyway, the point is,<br/>&gt; my initial idea is that scales not consisting solely of rational<br/>&gt; (harmonic) intervals may be labelled as &quot;inharmonic&quot;<br/>&gt; (irrational). My instinct is not to use &quot;rational scale&quot; or<br/>&gt; &quot;irrational scale&quot; to avoid suggestions of ideology, however<br/>&gt; vague, similar to the labelling of intervals and scales as<br/>&gt; &quot;Just&quot;. Plus, I think &quot;harmonic&quot; and &quot;inharmonic&quot; would more apt<br/>&gt; in musical use.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Before anyone misconstructs this in a hurry, let me clarify:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I am not confusing &quot;harmonic&quot; and &quot;inharmonic&quot; with &quot;consonance&quot;<br/>&gt; and &quot;dissonance&quot;. I&apos;m working with ref. again to the OED:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &quot;harmonic: adj. 2 Mus. b (of a tone) produced by vibration of a<br/>&gt; string etc. in an exact fraction of its length.&quot;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &quot;inharmonic: adj. esp. Mus.  not harmonic.&quot;</p><p>The term &quot;inharmonic&quot; is generally applied to timbres having non-<br/>harmonic partials, not to scales or tunings.</p><p>&gt; &gt; Yes, there are temperaments that are so accurate that they are,<br/>for<br/>&gt; &gt; all practical purposes, indistinguishable from JI (e.g., the 1/8-<br/>&gt; &gt; schisma Helmholtzian temperament or its even more precise 1/9-<br/>schisma<br/>&gt; &gt; variant), but they are still temperaments.  And, yes, such a<br/>&gt; &gt; temperament will be closer to exact JI than the very best efforts<br/>of<br/>&gt; &gt; singers or musicians to perform a composition accurately in JI.<br/>And<br/>&gt; &gt; who can argue but that the *intent* of the temperament and of the<br/>&gt; &gt; performer is exactly the same: to produce accurate<br/>*representations*<br/>&gt; &gt; (i.e., approximations) of rational intervals.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; However, we could save ourselves a lot of grief by calling these<br/>low-<br/>&gt; &gt; error temperaments &quot;near-just&quot; tunings or temperaments and<br/>refraining<br/>&gt; &gt; from misrepresenting them as &quot;just intonation&quot;, because, by<br/>&gt; &gt; definition, they aren&apos;t JI.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &quot;Low-error&quot; (for their intended purpose) temperaments are (or<br/>&gt; should be), by design, just that. However, there is something to<br/>&gt; what you propose, but it&apos;s not quite so simple.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;  And using six-digit rational ratios to<br/>&gt; &gt; represent an interval in some ET isn&apos;t going to make that a JI<br/>&gt; &gt; interval -- it&apos;s not a consonance that falls within anyone&apos;s<br/>intended<br/>&gt; &gt; harmonic limit.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; This is subjective. As long as it&apos;s a rational interval, we&apos;re<br/>&gt; still within the realm of the harmonic series, the sequence of<br/>&gt; pitches being integer multiples of a fundamental (base)<br/>&gt; frequency (the definition paraphrased from the article &quot;Pianos<br/>&gt; and Continued Fractions&quot; by Edward G. Dunne). See above for my<br/>&gt; thoughts on &quot;consonance&quot;.</p><p>I responded to this above under &quot;small-number&quot;.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; May I suggest that (taking 72-ET as a point of departure) only<br/>&gt; &gt; temperaments having an error less than 4 cents for all of the<br/>&gt; &gt; consonances being represented within the specified harmonic limit<br/>&gt; &gt; (and less than 2 cents for 2:3 and 3:4) be designated &quot;near-just&quot;?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Interesting, but personally don&apos;t see it as a good idea if used<br/>&gt; with a broad stroke, especially not for equal-intervalled<br/>&gt; scales. Someone working with a scale with a Werntz-like<br/>&gt; &quot;xenharmonic&quot; approach may not always be interested in<br/>&gt; approximations to rational intervals. But for something like<br/>&gt; meantone, well-temperaments, yes.</p><p>As long as the ET fits the definition, why shouldn&apos;t it be included?<br/>(So what if someone wants to use it differently?)</p><p>Meantone temperament and well-temperaments have errors large enough<br/>that I wouldn&apos;t call them near-just.  The requirement is that the<br/>consonances be slow-beating, relatively speaking.</p><p>&gt; An additional stray thought - it may be perceived by some that,<br/>&gt; &quot;Just Intonation&quot; is &quot;practised&quot;, as it were, by a group of<br/>&gt; people, as a school of thought. If so, it&apos;s practitioners may be<br/>&gt; entitled to place a small number limit on the ratios that they<br/>&gt; see as valid. That would allow for others to use and discuss the<br/>&gt; musical use of the harmonic series as they please, leaving out<br/>&gt; the term &quot;Just&quot;, without upsetting anyone. OK, make that a very<br/>&gt; stray thought...</p><p>The term &quot;just intonation&quot; is widely accepted, and that is not likely<br/>to change for the foreseeable future.  But I don&apos;t think that it<br/>should apply to near-just temperaments or large-numbered rational<br/>intervals that don&apos;t sound like JI.</p><p>&gt; ---<br/>&gt; PS. The above are evolving personal opinions &amp; views formed in a<br/>&gt; continuing strive to clarify &amp; simply my own thinking and work,<br/>&gt; such that it is. Mostly just me thinking out loud.</p><p>It&apos;s always good to know that someone out there is thinking!</p><p>--George</p></div><h3><a id=38226 href="#38226">ðŸ”—</a>jpehrson2 &#x3C;jpehrson@rcn.com&#x3E;</h3><span>6/26/2002 5:37:01 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In tuning@y..., &quot;gdsecor&quot; &lt;gdsecor@y...&gt; wrote:</p><p><a href="/tuning/topicId_38060.html#38221">/tuning/topicId_38060.html#38221</a></p><p> of no consequence.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; The size of the number is very important when you are dealing with<br/>&gt; musical acoustics.
