Let&apos;s<br/>&gt;JAM!!!</p><p>Right!</p><p>Just want to drop a note in that I enjoyed the recent Microfest (good job Bill!). It really gave me a glimpse into the history that is often over looked in other mainstream accounts of modern music (just finished reading Joel Chadabe&apos;s Electric Sound and Partch was mentioned very briefly). I really liked the emphasis on the &quot;hobo lifestyle&quot; found in the Partch short movie (and his bio/story). It is not often that you see acoustic performances of custom instruments. I liked it a lot. It was also good to get a gauge on this lists participants as well! I can learn a lot here. I will definitely be submitting recordings and perhaps even a request to perform live next year.</p><p>I like the D&amp;B track Jacky; keep it up. My roommate is an atmospheric D&amp;B DJ so I hear a lot of it. Yes, D&amp;B is a good wrapper for alternate tuning; especially the atmospheric stuff. We will have to make some tracks. I am helping my roommate produce D&amp;B; he is really taking off on his own now (he probably won&apos;t be studying tuning anytime soon; sometimes it is good to follow the heart).</p><p>I would like to post a link to my first electronic piece that I created last June prior to my &quot;conscious&quot; knowledge of microtonality. When you are dealing with electronic instruments and audio (as compared to midi; unless you tune the instrument) you often get a lot of tones/timbres outside of 12TET. Using a filter or anything that can modulate a source is a good example (of course you can get midi controlled filters; etc. not to mention all the voltage control/midi gear). I might add that I have learned so much since this recording that I am a little hesitant to post it, but I like it.</p><p>By the way I was accepted to study at the CCMix studio (<a href="http://www.upic.asso.fr/">http://www.upic.asso.fr/</a>) this July in Paris (going to be broke and need a loan; but it will be worth it). I don&apos;t mind posting the above track as I used it for demo material: <a href="http://www.egregious.net/~catharsis/tracks/tones.mp3">http://www.egregious.net/~catharsis/tracks/tones.mp3</a></p><p>I also sent a DJ mix compilation (Live March 7th; <a href="http://www.egregious.net/comps">www.egregious.net/comps</a>) hinting that if they did not accept it as music I was not interested in attending. I&apos;m attending, and am excited about this opportunity as I will be meeting several top researcher of the computer music field including Curtis Roads (will be doing the first public presentation of his new microsound book; yummy!), Carla Scaletti (creator of Kyma; presenting on using Kyma live), Joel Chadabe, among others. This might be my only formal study with the academic scene though as I am not too keen on its seclusion to the rest of the world.</p><p>If anyone on this list from the Paris vicinity wants to meet I am all for it. I will be attending as many underground electronic and experimental events over there as I have time for or can find... Unfortunately, from my research the electronic club scene in Paris is predominantly house music with almost no techno/experimental presence. I have some good internationally known London techno contacts and they don&apos;t even know people in Paris. I really want to find a free party scene. &lt;---- punk rock has never ended; it has just changed its tune. I am going to try and get a performance wherever possible while in Paris. I have a DJ contact in Madrid that I might visit and perform with his collective. I am hoping my London acquaintances let me perform at their clubs. I am about to finalize a performance in Pittsburgh, PA on my way to Europe. I might be opening for John Acquaviva and that would be a great honor! I&apos;ll definitely send a post to this list about performances. I would love to meet any European members of the tuning list!</p><p>Music is music... Music is communication. I will never be ashamed of anything I work on musically. I am involved with dance music primarily _because my peers understand it_. I will be involved with microtonal music to broaden my understanding and too communicate to a to the people of the world; maybe one day the people of the Western world at large. Elitism does not further communication. &lt;-- Ok, these are words from a young adult.</p><p>Essential stuff that people did not seem to know about when I talked to them at Microfest:</p><p>Audiomulch -- <a href="http://www.audiomulch.com">www.audiomulch.com</a> (there is a free extended demo; this will free you to work with audio and not just midi; innovative)<br/>Steinberg Nuendo -- Great DAW for the price. It has opened up so many doors to me.</p><p>Heck I could keep listing useful tools. In regard to the CSound debate I am luckily entering this area when I can choose from any tool to learn well. I am waiting for a Mac, so I can hit SuperCollider hard. I understand that SC is &quot;100 times&quot; better than CSound and much more capable. I don&apos;t have a Mac yet, so I will have to wait a while. Any opinions out there? Anyone work with it yet?</p><p>--Catharsis</p><p>Egregious<br/>&quot;Spiritual renewal through music for those outside the heard.&quot;<br/><a href="http://www.egregious.net/">http://www.egregious.net/</a></p></div><h3><a id=21804 href="#21804">ðŸ”—</a>jpehrson@rcn.com</h3><span>4/29/2001 7:03:19 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In tuning@y..., Catharsis &lt;catharsis@e...&gt; wrote:</p><p><a href="/tuning/topicId_21788.html#21788">/tuning/topicId_21788.html#21788</a><br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; By the way I was accepted to study at the CCMix studio<br/>&gt; (<a href="http://www.upic.asso.fr/">http://www.upic.asso.fr/</a>) this July in Paris (going to be broke<br/>and need a loan; but it will be worth it).</p><p>This looks great...

Anyone<br/>work<br/>&gt; with it yet?</p><p>I&apos;ve come *very close* to buying a G4 a number of times because of<br/>the wealth of great music software that only runs on the Mac. But<br/>each time I consider it, I look at the *price tags* on all that great<br/>software, shake my head, remember my great programming skill and the<br/>wealth of *free open-source* music and system software out there,<br/>such as CSound, sfront, and Linux, and the fact that my other hobby,<br/>computational finance, essentially is constrained to Windows because<br/>my data service runs there.</p><p>I&apos;ve been doing my homework for a dedicated music system. Here in<br/>Portland, for about $1500US you can put together a two-processor (1<br/>GHz Athlons), 256MB RAM, 20GB hard drive Linux box, including a $300<br/>Delta 4x4 sound card. I&apos;m *not* a hardware hacker -- I&apos;m gonna pay<br/>someone to put it together for me :-). But I am a hard-core software<br/>hacker ... so far my only concessions to commercial music software<br/>are CoolEdit 2000 and CDP. I think there are free Linux packages that<br/>are &quot;almost as good&quot;. I don&apos;t have any of the fancy CE2K plug-ins,<br/>just the basic package. So my plan is to get a dedicated Linux/music<br/>box and move the music off the laptop, freeing up quite a few<br/>gigabytes for the financial stuff.</p><p>While I&apos;m here, I wanna weigh in briefly on the Schumann resonance<br/>thingy. I have a Photosonix Nova Pro 100 Light/Sound machine and the<br/>books and software that go with it, and the Schumann resonance is a<br/>big deal in that world (pun intended :-). Now I personally believe<br/>that 7.83 just happens to be a number between 7 Hz and 8 Hz, both of<br/>which are in the high end of the theta range, for those of you who<br/>care. If this mailing list were anything other than a bunch of<br/>musical numerologists &lt;vbg&gt;, I would leave it there and just chalk it<br/>up to marketing hype and the placebo effect.</p><p>But since it *is* a bunch of musical numerologists, and a very<br/>creative and mostly friendly bunch at that, I&apos;ll add that I consider<br/>music based on the Schumann resonance to be &quot;found music&quot; in the same<br/>sense as, say, Dodge&apos;s &quot;Earth&apos;s Magnetic Field&quot;, and therefore<br/>something very interesting in my book. So, all you Schumann punks, as<br/>they say in Minnesota, &quot;Gopher It&quot; :-).<br/>--<br/>M.
