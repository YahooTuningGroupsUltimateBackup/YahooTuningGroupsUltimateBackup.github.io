Would prob. sound nice on<br/>three tenor recorders.</p><p>Now wouldn&apos;t it be nice if they played something like that in a<br/>library at closing time instead of an anouncement and a boring bell<br/>or whatever.</p><p>If anyone wants to look at the .ps file in windows:</p><p><a href="http://www.cs.wisc.edu/~ghost/">http://www.cs.wisc.edu/~ghost/</a></p><p>you need to install Ghostscript and GSView. Both free.</p><p>Also very interested in reading your history of harmony from<br/>middle ages perspective.</p><p>The  idea of continually moving away from and back to<br/>octave / unison as place of rest is something FTS uses<br/>in many of the fractal tunes, so thinking about the history of<br/>such ideas in development of harmony may well be helpful for<br/>future development of it. In fact I have just added a new option<br/>that adds in extra dissonant notes to the music, which highlights<br/>this continual movement away from and back to unison / octaves:</p><p><a href="http://tunesmithy.netfirms.com/tunes/new_fractal_tunes.htm">http://tunesmithy.netfirms.com/tunes/new_fractal_tunes.htm</a></p><p>The one that uses this is &quot;approaching instability&quot;.</p><p>&quot;Pythag diatonic tune&quot; sounds somewhat &quot;early music&quot; inspired.<br/>It uses only octaves and unisons for new notes (as do a fair number<br/>of the fractal tunes), without the new option for extra<br/>dissonances. I&apos;ve done a score for the first three pages of it,<br/>so you can have a look  at it if interested.</p><p>Robert</p></div>
