They are very similar. I hear a difference, but it could be my<br/>&gt;imagination.</p><p>Example 1: The difference is definitely real, and should be audible to any<br/>Partchophile or other experienced microtonalist. However, to make the<br/>difference more noticeable to all, I would use timbres that don&apos;t die away<br/>so quickly.</p><p>Examples 2&amp;3: I get an &quot;Unable to establish connection with the server&quot;<br/>error.</p></div>
