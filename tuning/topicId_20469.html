You don&apos;t notice it at all<br/>when listening to a midi file, or when playing<br/>the output of a score editor, but you do when<br/>playing from midi keyboard. One can adjust to<br/>it and learn to anticipate notes - I believe<br/>acoustic organs are like that.</p><p>With a fast p.c. and with the latest versions<br/>of the software, the latency gets less and<br/>less.</p><p>May at least help tide you over until you get<br/>a good soundcard?</p><p>For it&apos;s price range I&apos;m very happy with the<br/>Soundblaster Live soundcard, and it has good relative<br/>pitch discrimination. Uses memory for the wavetable,<br/>but that&apos;s fine on a modern p.c. Also has<br/>soundfonts.</p><p>Does have a rather interesting sound on the default<br/>koto voice when it is<br/>played out of it&apos;s natural range (as I posted<br/>to the list about before), but that is<br/>rather endearing actually. However, though it<br/>supports nearly all the standard MIDI conrollers,<br/>doesn&apos;t seem to support the portamento controller,<br/>if that is important.</p><p>Robert</p></div>
