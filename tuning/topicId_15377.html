They include two ideally<br/>euphonious intervals of the fifth/fourth category, plus a relatively<br/>tense M2, m7, or M9.</p><p>The other kind of mildest or most consonant unstable sonority consists<br/>of a _quinta fissa_, or ideally euphonious fifth &quot;split&quot; into two<br/>unstable but relatively blending thirds, 64:81:96 or 54:64:81.</p><p>To explain the pleasant effect of a sonority like 4:6:9 in a Gothic<br/>setting (e.g. Perotin or Machaut), we might also note the factor of<br/>&quot;stylistic congruity.&quot; That is, in a texture where 2:3:4 or 3:4:6<br/>trines set the standard of rich stable concord and euphony, a 4:6:9 or<br/>9:12:16, etc., sounds like a provocative and energetic variation on a<br/>trine, sharing the same overall quintal/quartal flavor.</p><p>Maybe a term like &quot;polydyadic&quot; harmonic entropy or concord/discord or<br/>whatever would convey the idea that we&apos;re indeed looking at<br/>multi-voice sonorities, but analyzing them in terms of combinations of<br/>dyads rather in terms of the more intricate methods of &quot;triadic<br/>harmonic entropy.&quot;</p><p>One of the things that really caught my imagination two decades ago is<br/>how combinations like 6:8:9 or 4:6:9 occur over a wide range of world<br/>musics where fifths or fourths are treated as the main vertical<br/>concords. Your &quot;pizza&quot; maybe provides another view of this pattern.</p><p>Most appreciatively,</p><p>Margo Schulter<br/><a href="mailto:mschulter@value.net">mschulter@value.net</a></p></div>
