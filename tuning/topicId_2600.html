Ancient Greek and Roman<br/>music is only very fuzzily understood, and will probably remain<br/>largely so, because very little remains in terms of actual<br/>physical records.</p><p>My guess, based on my study of ancient Greek music theory<br/>texts, is that it had a *lot* in common with &apos;oriental&apos; music.</p><p>&apos;Oriental musical tendencies&apos; simply refers to the fact that<br/>Egyptian and Mesopotamian music was no doubt quite different<br/>from indigenous Roman music, and it&apos;s been documented<br/>(see Grove&apos;s Dictionary, &apos;Roman&apos; entry) that the Romans<br/>gleefully absorbed and enjoyed this &apos;oriental&apos; music<br/>after those lands were incorporated into the Empire.</p><p>&gt; And certainly the Roman conquest had nothing to do with it.<br/>&gt; The City of Alexandria was known as that &quot;Greek city, not far<br/>&gt; from Egypt.&quot;</p><p>But Greece and Egypt were both part of the Roman Empire by<br/>the time of Ptolemy/Nicomachus, so Alexandria was simultaneously<br/>Egyptian, Greek, and Roman (but mostly Greek).
