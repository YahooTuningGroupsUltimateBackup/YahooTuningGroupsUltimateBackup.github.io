It is played on what sounds to me<br/>&gt; like a mean-tone temperament on organ.  But what is meant by the &quot;third<br/>&gt; tone&quot;?  Does it mean the key of E?  I notice that some of the chords are<br/>&gt; very consonants while others are noticeably dissonant.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;      Also, in a conversation tonight with a mathematician, there came up<br/>&gt; the question of whether any tunings have been conceived in terms of the<br/>&gt; &quot;golden ratio&quot; (so effectively applied to architectural &amp;  visual<br/>&gt; productions, as well as observed so often in natural objects) in terms of<br/>&gt; musical intervals.

Meantone leading tones are larger,<br/>but at 66.6 cents, thirdtones are larger still.  In the Mordecai Sandberg<br/>&quot;Psalm #51&quot; which we are premiering on Oct. 11th hasthirdtones.  Recently,<br/>soprano Dorien Verheijden and I rehearsed in a park in Amsterdam.  The<br/>thirdtones set very distinctly in my mind&apos;s ear, both above and below any<br/>given note.  We practiced straight thirdtone scales so as to get a feel for<br/>the interval.</p><p>Re: Haba - well, Monzo, your flawless memory strikes again.  Yes, I&apos;ve a<br/>problem with Haba&apos;s music.  It just doesn&apos;t send me.  Oh, I like the overture<br/>to &quot;The Mother&quot; opera, and I enjoyed playing a translation of a 5-part choral<br/>piece for 5 bassoons over a decade ago.  But I prefer non-athematicism.  I<br/>believe the microtonal world benefitted by Alois Haba, but his music is not<br/>especially to my taste (other than the aforementioned pieces).</p><p>Johnny Reinhard</p></div><h3>Kraig Grady &#x3C;kraiggrady@xxxxxxxxx.xxxx&#x3E;</h3><span>9/11/1999 6:42:36 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Peter!<br/>    There has been quite a few including Kornerup and  Yasser&apos;s 5+7. 7+12<br/>series implies a golden fifth.
