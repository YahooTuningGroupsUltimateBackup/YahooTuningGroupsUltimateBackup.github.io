Your Rhodes can only be retuned by a small amount, so you won&apos;t be<br/>able to do that either. Otherwise, 31 is great for structured, diatonic<br/>music, since it is a meantone tuning; while 24 is little more than two sets<br/>of 12 (except for Arabic scales, etc.) . . .</p></div><h3>Alexandros Papadopoulos &#x3C;alexmoog@hotmail.com&#x3E;</h3><span>10/5/2000 3:17:18 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Are there any acoustic or electro-acoustic keyboard instruments with<br/>microtonal capabilities ?

Split sharps are a very<br/>historical way of building harpsichords, allowing for up to 5 extra notes<br/>per octave. Split naturals could be built on the same principles. Willard<br/>Martin in Pennsylvania, and Bill Jurgenson, formerly of Michigan but<br/>currently in Lauffen somewhere on the banks of the Neckar in Germany,<br/>build them now. Bill was on this list for a while.</p><p>The ideas juxtaposed, that you need an electronic instrument to<br/>study microtunings because they cannot be done acoustically, AND that<br/>people whose brains are not seriously mutated out of normal pathways are<br/>supposed to care about the music thus produced, are incompatible.

On many multiple-manual harpsichords, the manuals may be assigned<br/>in various ways to what&apos;s inside by way of lever.  The same goes for (less<br/>common) single-manual, multi-scale instruments.  The trouble is that the<br/>different scales are traditionally used to change the timbre of the<br/>instrument, and so the microtonal user will have to put up with interleaved<br/>timbres.

I&apos;m pretty fast.  Actually, I think such a lever<br/>would be great.  Michael Harrison has done impressive things with a pedal,<br/>and the &quot;lever&quot; on a harpsichord is often in the form of a pedal.  In fact,<br/>since harpsichords already have this kind of pedal, they are arguably<br/>better-suited to this technique than pianos, with which Harrison was left<br/>to modifying the una corda mechanism.  It would be great to have a<br/>harpsichord designed with two identical scales, with jacks to switch by<br/>pedal, scaled for 24 out-of 31-tET.</p><p>The root-controller idea takes on new scope with electronics, and the<br/>ability to root on all twelve of the top keys, rather than onto only two.<br/>I have often wondered how easy it might be to take a midi controller -- say,<br/>a pedalboard -- and use it to control the roots on a normal keyboard up top.<br/>Note-ons from the pedal could be sorted by note number -- perhaps by a CAL<br/>applet, which would then apply the appropriate pitch bend to all the notes<br/>from the keys.</p><p>-Carl</p></div><h3>Paul H.

Yes, this is more of a consonance-added approach than a<br/>xenharmonic one, but for some of us, 12-tET just doesn&apos;t cut it for 5-limit<br/>on acoustic instruments.  And Harrison showed that 24 tones of 7-limit JI<br/>are intersting.  It isn&apos;t hard to subset the 7-limit in such a way that all<br/>complete tetrads fall on one manual at a time.  Yes, this approach is<br/>ultimately going to be just a subset of Margo&apos;s double-manual suggestion, but<br/>I think it&apos;s a great deal more intuitive at the keyboard, and more than<br/>promising enough to justify the construction of a few harpsichords.</p><p>-Carl</p></div><h3>Paul Erlich &#x3C;PERLICH@ACADIAN-ASSET.COM&#x3E;</h3><span>10/6/2000 5:38:42 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@egroups.com">tuning@egroups.com</a>, Carl Lumma &lt;CLUMMA@N...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt;It would be great to have a harpsichord designed with two<br/>identical scales,<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt;with jacks to switch by pedal, scaled for 24 out-of 31-tET.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;But any chords would have to come from one of two sets of 12,<br/>right?
