The numbers<br/>occur and react in patterns, and those patterns are what give<br/>us pleasure in listening to, creating, or even just contemplating<br/>music.</p><p>These patterns can be found in many different aspects of music,<br/>be it melody, harmony, rhythm, meter, form, volume, location<br/>(&apos;panning&apos;), timbre, tuning, etc.</p><p>The fact that music usually requires *time* as a dimension<br/>in which to unfold adds greatly to its amenity to numerical<br/>manipulation, and to the theorizing about how that numerical<br/>manipulation works (and this applies to all the different aspects<br/>of music listed above - and probably others).</p><p>Time is less understood than the three ordinary spatial dimensions,<br/>so therefore theories abound and they are less easy to prove.</p><p>This is one of the reasons I have likened recent work in tuning<br/>theory (including my own) to that of quantum physics and<br/>modern astronomy.  All three disciplines seem to me to be dealing<br/>with the same kinds of concepts and perceptual/cognitive processes.</p><p>&gt; Are there any good references out there that deal with this sort<br/>&gt; of application of serial techniques to the pitches/intervals of a<br/>&gt; Just Intonation tuned system?</p><p>Steven Elster wrote a magnificent analysis of the JI and serial<br/>techniques used masterfully by Johnston in his 6th Quartet.<br/>&apos;A Harmonic and Serial Analysis of Ben Johnston&apos;s String Quartet<br/>No. 6&apos;,<br/>_Perspectives of New Music_, v 29 # 2, Summer 1991, p 138-165.</p><p>Joseph L.
