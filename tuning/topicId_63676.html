Van Halen<br/>developed a technique of flatting his B string slightly so that the<br/>interval between the open G and B is a perfect, beatless third. This<br/>consonant third was almost unheard of in distorted-guitar rock, and<br/>allowed Van Halen to use major chords in a way that mixed classic<br/>hard rock power with &quot;happy&quot; pop.

Van Halen<br/>is quoted as saying, &quot;...the guitar... is just theoretically built<br/>wrong. Because every string Â— the intervals are fourths, except for<br/>from G to B, which is a third, and it&apos;s always that damn B string<br/>that fucks it up. So I always tune it a little bit flat, and then<br/>when I need it in tune, I just bend it up. Because once it&apos;s sharp,<br/>you can&apos;t make it flat! Over the years, you know, it&apos;s just a feel<br/>thing, you develop a feel for when you hit a certain chord, you know<br/>how to manipulate the string to make it in tune.&quot;</p><p>Despite his wording above, Van Halen does not flat the B string for<br/>everything. &quot;The B string is always [difficult] to keep in tune all<br/>the time!
