There is an interesting thank you...it says &quot;Paco<br/>de Lucia thanks Ramon de Algeciras for his help in watching over the<br/>tunings during the recording and mixing of this album.&quot; And, Paco does<br/>play Ud on two tracks, as well as sings...for the first time on disc, I<br/>believe. The Ud playing is stunning, and sure doesn&apos;t sound like it&apos;s in<br/>12 eq; the vocals, too, sound other than 12. I don&apos;t know exactly what<br/>he&apos;s doing, but it sounds like he may be experimenting a bit with some<br/>other tuning concepts.<br/>    Of course, flamenco&apos;s roots go back to India, and the gypsies<br/>wandered all over Asia, the Middle East, and North Africa, before<br/>settling in Andalusia...the influence of all of these cultures left it&apos;s<br/>mark on flamenco. To go back to the past, in this case, and revitalize<br/>flamenco by exploring the ancient tunings, serves to make the form even<br/>more complete, in a very modern way. It&apos;s a good sign, and I hope it<br/>starts a trend ...Paco is just the guy to show the way...Hstick</p></div><h3><a id=6690 href="#6690">ðŸ”—</a>Kraig Grady &#x3C;kraiggrady@xxxxxxxxx.xxxx&#x3E;</h3><span>12/7/1999 12:40:32 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Neil Haverstick wrote:</p><p>&gt;<br/>&gt;     Of course, flamenco&apos;s roots go back to India, and the gypsies<br/>&gt; wandered all over Asia, the Middle East, and North Africa, before<br/>&gt; settling in Andalusia...the influence of all of these cultures left it&apos;s<br/>&gt; mark on flamenco.

I remember<br/>seeing one guitar player while in spain who used every single chord root<br/>you could imagine. Somehow he made anything work. Have NEVER heard anything<br/>like it on record so it might have been an individual fluke. The music on<br/>the whole left me experimenting for years afterwards trying to get what i<br/>heard in the voice. A great condensation of some great musical influences.</p><p>-- Kraig Grady<br/>North American Embassy of Anaphoria Island<br/><a href="http://www.anaphoria.com">http://www.anaphoria.com</a></p></div>
