By this wording I am *not*<br/>requiring that each and every composition using a particular scale<br/>*must* have a melody, nor do I intend to imply either 1) that all of<br/>the notes in the scale *must* be present in a melody, or 2) that a<br/>melody *may not* contain any notes foreign to the scale.  Instead, my<br/>intention is to *exclude* such off-the-wall sets of tones as &quot;middle<br/>C, plus the lowest and highest notes on the piano&quot; from consideration<br/>as musical scales on the basis that they&apos;re clearly unsuitable (in<br/>most everyone&apos;s opinion) for writing melodies.</p><p>But I think that my two definitions could use a little rewording,<br/>possibly replacing &quot;related by (more or less) specific interval-<br/>classes&quot; by &quot;related by generic interval-classes&quot;.</p><p>&gt;  and should also include ALL NOTES USED in a &quot;piece&quot; of music.<br/>&gt; This then covers notes which may be used in the harmony, yet<br/>absent<br/>&gt; remain from the melody.</p><p>I don&apos;t think that this agrees with common usage of the<br/>term &quot;scale.&quot;  For example, if I&apos;m correct in thinking that a piece<br/>of diatonic music uses a diatonic scale, then it&apos;s not entirely out<br/>of the realm of possibility to find notes (i.e., accidentals), in<br/>either the melody or the harmony, that are foreign to the scale.</p><p>In other words, what I&apos;m *not* saying is that the members of the<br/>scale are determined by where they&apos;re used in a piece.

Some tunings support quasi-diatonic scales that don&apos;t quite match the familiar meantone diatonic scale, but can be used in similar ways. Hanson temperament with its chain of minor thirds has a good octatonic scale which seems to have a lot in common with the octatonic scale as used by composers like Stravinsky, and lemba temperament has a whole-tone scale that sounds a lot like the familiar one. Many tunings have something close to the pelog and slendro scales of Indonesian music, but it&apos;s hard to find one that sounds like a really close match.</p><p>The thing about the almost-diatonic and almost-octatonic scales is that you can be tempted into using familiar patterns, but watch out! Before long you might run across something that sounds out of place.</p></div><h3><a id=67938 href="#67938">ðŸ”—</a>Cameron Bobro &#x3C;misterbobro@yahoo.com&#x3E;</h3><span>11/9/2006 12:36:13 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, Herman Miller &lt;hmiller@...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt; Many tunings have something  close to the pelog and slendro scales<br/>&gt;of Indonesian music, but it&apos;s hard  to find one that sounds like a<br/>&gt;really close match.</p><p>I don&apos;t think it&apos;s possible to divorce tuning from timbre (unless<br/>you&apos;re working with an orchestra of sinewaves, or belligerently<br/>imposing the ideals of one reality on another).</p><p>Number is adjective, not noun- 2:1 would usually be better written as<br/>2&Acirc;&deg;:1&Acirc;&deg; .</p><p>-Cameron Bobro</p></div><h3><a id=67940 href="#67940">ðŸ”—</a>Tom Dent &#x3C;stringph@gmail.com&#x3E;</h3><span>11/9/2006 6:32:18 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, Charles Lucy &lt;lucy@...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; this distinction goes beyond &quot;used to write a<br/>&gt; melody&quot;; and should also include ALL NOTES USED in a &quot;piece&quot; of music.<br/>&gt; This then covers notes which may be used in the harmony, yet absent<br/>&gt; remain from the melody.<br/>&gt;</p><p>All notes - or all pitches? - and does that mean all pitches in some<br/>kind of ideally tuned version, or all pitches produced in a specific<br/>performance by live musicians?</p><p>I think it obvious that both scales and tunings are some kinds of<br/>abstraction which deliberately (and with good reason) omit to quantify<br/>some pitches actually present in performance - for example scoops and<br/>portamenti - and some very small differences of pitch.</p><p>~~~T~~~</p></div><h3><a id=67944 href="#67944">ðŸ”—</a>yahya_melb &#x3C;yahya@melbpc.org.au&#x3E;</h3><span>11/10/2006 5:01:15 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, Cameron Bobro wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>[snip]<br/>&gt; Number is adjective, not noun- 2:1 would usually be better written as<br/>&gt; 2&Acirc;&deg;:1&Acirc;&deg; .</p><p>I think the two of us may have to discuss this further!</p><p>Regards,<br/>Yahya</p></div>
