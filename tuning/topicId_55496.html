Cosmos/galaxy/solar/planetary/human/<br/>animal/vegetable/insect/reptile/fish/mineral/crystal/molecule/atom/subatom<br/>and beyond: all is one and one is all.<br/>Are you following this, Anna? The &apos;disturbances&apos;, as Ray has pointed out,<br/>affect the entirity of creation (indeed are the ebb and flow of creation),<br/>but<br/>it is only our fixated conditioned responses - principally linguistically<br/>based<br/>in humans since fixated, electrochemical, (and largely unnecessary)<br/>languaged<br/>&apos;noise&apos; exists as the primary focus/prism of our consciousness - that cause<br/>us to<br/>&apos;behave&apos; in certain ways. Drop the noise/chatter [ie ATTEND to the<br/>sensations<br/>as they come and go and the difference-iation that we experience as<br/>consciousness subsides, de-solves, into the w{holeness}. Don&apos;t<br/>let the &apos;human spots&apos; get you down, just be aware of them. When you can<br/>&apos;calibrate&apos; them, yoiu will develop something we presently call intuition -<br/>the<br/>feeling principle, presently dormant/buried under habitual noise (itself<br/>cyclic and<br/>hence possessing cyclic momentum), that is the parallel operation of the<br/>sensory<br/>system].</p><p>As above, so below, or in the words of the poet:</p><p>For in and out, above, about, below,<br/>&apos;Tis nothing but a Magic Shadow-show,<br/>Play&apos;d in a Box whose Candle is the Sun,<br/>Round which we Phantom Figures come and go.</p><p>PS Sorry to waffle on so much, but some synthesis<br/>of the various threads arises here spontaneously.</p><p>----- Original Message -----<br/>From: &quot;Bill Arnold&quot; &lt;<a href="mailto:billarnoldfla@yahoo.com">billarnoldfla@yahoo.com</a>&gt;<br/>To: &lt;<a href="mailto:cyclesi@yahoogroups.com">cyclesi@yahoogroups.com</a>&gt;<br/>Sent: Saturday, August 14, 2004 4:41 AM<br/>Subject: [cyclesi] Re: The Circle of the Octave</p><p>&gt; &quot;Robert Byron Duncan&quot; &lt;zeusrdx@y...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt; &gt; This IS interesting<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; z<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; OK: this has been discussed at length on tuning<br/>&gt; at <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a><br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Bill<br/>&gt; Author of Arnold&apos;s law<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; --- In <a href="mailto:cyclesi@yahoogroups.com">cyclesi@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;Dan Scorpio&quot; &lt;Dan.Scorpio@b...&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; wrote:<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; Draw a circle.<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; Mark twelve o&apos;clock 1<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; Three                        1.25<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; Six                            1.5<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; Nine                          1.75<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; Twelve                      2<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; Plot the sine wave with 0 deg at 1 (=home).<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; At 1.25, a particle sitting on the imaginary rotating circle<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; is at the maximum positive distance away from home and<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; is changing direct from + to - wrt home.<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; At 1.5, particle is max possible distance from home and max (-)<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; y coord and beginning the journey back.<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; At 1.75, particle is max -ve x away from home &amp; moving back to<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; 0,0.<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; The points 1, 1.25, 1.5, 1.75 and 2 represent the tones<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; root, third, fifth, minor seventh and octave in the justly<br/>&gt; intoned<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; musical scale.<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; The second is at 45 degress (9/8), fourth at 120 degrees (4/3),<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; sixth at 240 degrees (5/3) and seventh at 315 degrees (15/8).<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; Likewise, any harmonic (relative to the root) may be plotted as<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; an angle on the circle. Even more, one may choose any point<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; on the circle of the octave (which means ANY frequency which<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; has been octaved down by 2^n to lie between 1.0 and 2.0 [= 0<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; to 360 deg] and, by examining its relative angular position to<br/>&gt; other<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; frequencies, establish the harmonics.<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; The harmonics are related to each other by certain discrete<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; angles/geometrical configurations: eg:<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; relative 4th Chord = equilateral triangle<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; root, 3rd and 5th chords = isoceles triangles<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; 2nd, 6th and 7th by irregular triangles<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; On one simple circle, one can observe the general harmonic<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; relationships between frequencies of whatever magnitude.<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; A question I am exploring (very slowly - I have hundreds of<br/>&gt; reduced<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; frequencies and more to come) is: &apos;If one chooses a given period<br/>&gt; as<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; an octave, do there exist salient harmonic points within that<br/>&gt; &gt; octave<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; (eg 3rd, 5th, minor 7th) that give rise to sub-octave detectable<br/>&gt; &gt; effects?&apos;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; The &apos;square&apos;, conjunction and opposition immediately come to mind<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; on both micro and macro levels.<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; Furthermore if one has several &apos;magnetic tones&apos; playing at<br/>&gt; various<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; frequencies, (which in themselves are sunject to internal<br/>&gt; &gt; modulation)<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; when do those tones interact and beat - and what are the tangible<br/>&gt; &gt; effects<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; (and how do we adjust our conditioned perceptions to notice them?)<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Yahoo!
