I find that, up to and including the 6th<br/>(or, perhaps I might alternatively say the 5th harmonic), the general<br/>identity of the complex note is established, and (with addition of<br/>the higher order harmonics beginning with the 7th harmonic, indeed)<br/>no simple sense of identity exists. It is amazing (and humbling) to<br/>realize (by listening) how essential (but non-straightforward and<br/>complicated)the upper order harmonic content is to the timbre of a<br/>note. The simultaneous &quot;symphony&quot; of modes of vibration involved in<br/>even the most basic &quot;string twanging&quot;, and evolution in time of each<br/>of those individual modes of vibration, leaves our (I&apos;ll say my)<br/>models (melodic or harmonic) hanging in the wind, perhaps struggling<br/>to hang on to a conceptually atomistic and non-chaotic mathematical<br/>viewpoint (human nature, indeed, but little match for Nature itself).<br/>Like lighting a match on the night of the 4th of July, and grinning..</p><p>Musical choices from the numbers brings numbers into the world,<br/>troubled by &quot;nasty effects&quot; such as complex timbre.., perhaps seeking<br/>an underlaying structure which conforms to an overlaying conceptual<br/>premise.</p><p>That some tonal similarities in, and metric symmetries between, the<br/>theoretically predictable &quot;behaviour&quot; of certain rational integer<br/>elements with a scale-set when combined with certain other element(s)<br/>of that scale set exist, I have no doubt. There is stunning visual<br/>topological beauty in the identifiable patterns by which certain<br/>rational integer scale intervals intermingle within the process by<br/>which we differentiate between them as distinct (as opposed to<br/>homogenous) sonic entities, like the elements (each unique in some<br/>ways, and similar to certain others in other ways).</p><p>My ideas (in relation to the presence or absence of various scale<br/>intervals due to mathematical properties of those scale intervals)<br/>seem to (at least somewhat) &quot;correlate&quot; to what my ear prefers or<br/>recognizes (at times). Iteration (between model and practice and back<br/>again) is inherently problematic, in that one only knows what one has<br/>been looking for when one is close to, or right on top of, what one<br/>has been looking for. Global assumptions are hard to make in such<br/>complicated environments through inherently subjective metaphors. How<br/>will one know (if and) when they find the &quot;golden fleece&quot;? Will<br/>they &quot;know it when they see it&quot;? To be sure, it (may) be elegantly<br/>simple, unified, uncluttered, efficient, etc. It may encompass<br/>multiple characteristics of &quot;note&quot; within a single unified (perhaps<br/>even symmetrical) structure. But all of the above are properties of<br/>conceptual (rather than experiencial) knowledge. They may happen<br/>to &quot;map&quot; characteristics which (in at least one instance and context)<br/>pleased my ear, as well. But, for the most part, my searching for<br/>structures of topological (tactile and visual) beauty, and my hoping<br/>that what proves elegant in the visual domain also *happens* to<br/>equate to what proves interesting in the musical domain can, at best,<br/>follow my sense of musical hearing around like a deaf painter, hoping<br/>some how to understand what color or other optical characteristic<br/>would adequately describe the subject matter of the &quot;subjects&quot; audio,<br/>or musical, &quot;vocalizations&quot;. Even being able to *hear* such<br/>vocalizations does not select the color or brush by which I might<br/>attempt to *see* (as a secondary, and not primary, way of *hearing*)</p><p>BTW: I&apos;ve always been fascinated with the derivations of linguistic<br/>metaphors which we utilize in order to categorize/report sensory<br/>perceptions. Below are some (I think, interesting) examples:</p><p>Of the aural sense, I can think of only &quot;loud&quot;, &quot;roaring&quot;, &quot;echo&quot;,<br/>and &quot;singing&quot; (at the moment) as (non-music-theoretical) metaphors<br/>that we use to describe sounds which is distinct to human hearing,<br/>and not other senses. A definite majority of the other metaphors<br/>utilized to describe the character of sounds seem (to me) to derive<br/>from our *other* senses (and similarly, where vision is concerned)!</p><p>Soft, gentle, harsh, rough, big, bouncy, fuzzy, fat, sharp and flat<br/>(in the non-music-theory context), big, tiny, smooth, wandering,<br/>ripping, &quot;shredding&quot; (mosh-pit), dancing, moving, jangling, muffled,<br/>stinging, warm, cold, empty, full, searing, jolting, crisp, bubbling,<br/>etc. ALL DERIVE FROM A (in the most basic analysis) TACTILY<br/>DISCOVERED EXPERIENCE OR A TACTILY PERFORMED (AND EXPERIENCED) ACT.</p><p>Bright, dark, glowing, luminous, hazy, brilliant, effervescent,<br/>foggy, misty, shimmering, colorful, shining (there must be more...)<br/>ALL DERIVE FROM A VISUALLY DISCOVERED EXPERIENCE.</p><p>Without typically considering it so, perhaps our multi-<br/>sensory &quot;neural networks&quot; (where it comes to the metaphors utilized<br/>to describe &quot;properties of sensory information&quot;) are, via<br/>evolutionary processes are (in some limited but not<br/>necessarily &quot;focally&quot; knowable way) inextricably-intertwined with<br/>each other, such that - we will always wonder whether our visual<br/>(including numerical and geometrical) concepts will ever search,<br/>however fruitfully or fruitlessly, for pattern and repetition in the<br/>aural vocalizations of other entities (for understandable reasons)<br/>for meaning which may be somehow transcribed for future reference...</p><p>That &quot;all is number&quot; might be (by me, anyway) revised to, &quot;all will<br/>be numbered&quot; (a very different averement, indeed). Everyday, in the<br/>idiotic and chaotic &quot;markets&quot; the pundits will tell you (for lack of<br/>substantive information about random/chaotic functions) that &quot;all the<br/>rules have changed&quot;. They swarm in &quot;bullish/bearish engulfings&quot; (a<br/>*real* phrase in what they call &quot;technical analysis&quot;) based upon the<br/>prevalence of sentiment to the *contrary* on the parts of the others!</p><p>There is nothing about tomorrow that knowledge of histories prior<br/>patterns will prepare you for. There is no way to know whether a<br/>master improvisor will next create, or remove, musical tension...</p><p>The music (tonality and placement in time) which I like to hear/make<br/>may be repetitious and simple (blues shuffles) but the melodic<br/>improvisation&apos;s &quot;voicing&quot;, choice of notes, sustain and timbre, while<br/>often merely pentatonic, (hopefully) transcends the limitations of<br/>the open-string tuning outright by bending notes and some chords. I<br/>(purport to) know my instrument *through* it&apos;s limitations in<br/>amplitude and timbre, as a result of the proces of (by many<br/>simultaneous means) working to overcome the medium and it&apos;s given<br/>limitations - fully focused on the (largely unconcious) process of<br/>searching for the &quot;right&quot; ways and means (to my own ear) of<br/>accomplishing (despite the environments limitations), the<br/>&quot;vocalization&quot; of the &quot;words in my head&quot;, in tone and space...</p><p>Sleepless in Seattle (but hopefully not near as corny),  J Gill</p></div><h3><a id=31302 href="#31302">ðŸ”—</a>jpehrson2 &#x3C;jpehrson@rcn.com&#x3E;</h3><span>12/10/2001 7:45:48 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In tuning@y..., &quot;unidala&quot; &lt;JGill99@i...&gt; wrote:</p><p><a href="/tuning/topicId_31176.html#31248">/tuning/topicId_31176.html#31248</a></p><p>&gt;<br/>&gt; J GILL: Has anyone else played around with the &quot;Overtone&quot; freeware?</p><p>HI J.

Yet,<br/>&gt; after growing up in the US, and listening to 2-5-1 and 5-1-4 stuff<br/>in<br/>&gt; popular music all their life (by nurture, experience, suggestion,<br/>&gt; etc), he states that they were highly &quot;conditioned&quot; to western<br/>&gt; melodic choices and movements. He taught an improvisation class to<br/>&gt; these youths, and told me about how, one day, he played them a<br/>piece<br/>&gt; which started on the 1/1, moved about, and then ended coming to<br/>rest<br/>&gt; at the Minor 7th interval of 12-tone. He says that they were so<br/>used<br/>&gt; to western music &quot;resolving&quot; back to the 1/1, that his piece drove<br/>&gt; them *crazy* (in that they did not like, and could not be<br/>comfortable<br/>&gt; with, his piece ending on the Minor 7 (as opposed to the 1/1). This<br/>&gt; really appears to demonstrate the relative unimportance of *nature*<br/>&gt; (genes, etc), and the predominance of *nurture*</p><p>Again, I don&apos;t find this demonstration convincing at all! Maybe all<br/>that&apos;s been demonstrated here is the _coherence_, _logic_, and<br/>_universal comprehensibility_ of the western tonal language! How can<br/>you be sure?</p><p>&gt; Music, like language, is largely a social form of emotional<br/>&gt; communication and expression.</p><p>Yes.</p><p>&gt; My father, the big-time philosopher,<br/>&gt; goes so far as to maintain that until Helen Keller actually grasped<br/>&gt; language in communicating with another person, she did not (in the<br/>&gt; that sense we experience it) *think*.</p><p>I&apos;ve always argued vehemently against this point of view. I acquired<br/>language very late, and I always *thought* non-verbally. Maybe this<br/>is why I was so good at Physics and so bad at English in school.</p><p>Anyway, on the audience bit, I don&apos;t see it as a down-side at all,<br/>because I believe that the spiritual kernel within all of us is<br/>pretty much the same, and if I reach a musical level where I feel the<br/>spiritual meaning is very strong, then I have to believe that any<br/>audience members listening with an open heart will receive that<br/>meaning -- and I simply can&apos;t concern myself with those who aren&apos;t.</p></div>
