Don&apos;t you agree?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Cordially,<br/>&gt; Oz.</p><p>Dear Oz,</p><p>You&apos;re not alone.  Over the years we have heard from many on<br/>this list (and I have heard from more than a few offlist and<br/>in person) who have chosen not to participate because of the<br/>high volume of posts, especially posts featuring protracted<br/>arguments over arcane details.</p><p>I myself have often been part of such threads, and I often<br/>met this criticism by saying that it should be easy to ignore<br/>or delete messages one isn&apos;t interested in.  But it turns out<br/>that it is not so easy.  It poisons the discourse.</p><p>I was against splitting off harmonic entropy and tuning-math<br/>to separate lists, but it turned out to be the right decision<br/>by a mile.</p><p>And now, looking back through the archives, I can see that<br/>we would have been better served in many more cases by<br/>practicing an ounce of restraint.</p><p>So please, everyone, try to observe these simple practices<br/>(I will do so also):</p><p>1. Read all messages since your last visit BEFORE replying<br/>to any of them.  You may be repeating someone who has already<br/>replied.</p><p>2. Collect your thoughts and post them in as few messages<br/>as possible.  Ask yourself, &quot;Am I posting more than my share<br/>of messages today?&quot;</p><p>3. Don&apos;t make things personal.  This is about music!<br/>It&apos;s not worth it and you know you&apos;ll wind up regretting<br/>it later (probably within a few short hours).</p><p>4. If you think you&apos;ve made a breakthrough in music theory,<br/>which has eluded generations of great minds, and which the<br/>entire world must know about: please don&apos;t choose this list<br/>as the place to break the story.  This list has been around<br/>since the early &apos;90s, and we&apos;ve heard many such stories<br/>before.  They have never met the test of critical reasoning.<br/>On the other hand, several people who began with comparative<br/>modesty *have* wound up making serious contributions to<br/>music theory on this list.  New members will get a firm<br/>footing as quickly as possible by phrasing as many things<br/>as possible as questions (rather than statements).</p><p>5. Sometime in your first year on the list, please take a<br/>leap of faith and say hello.  Introduce yourself using your<br/>real name, and say a bit about what interests you.  The<br/>whole point of a mailing list is to share information and<br/>experiences.  There are about 1200 valid e-mail accounts<br/>currently receiving messages from our list.  We will all<br/>benefit if we hear from more of them!</p><p>-A.
