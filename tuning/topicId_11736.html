But remember, most of those chords didn&apos;t really beat it in a<br/>very meaningful way, but mainly due to their wider intervals. For example,<br/>if we had constrained the outer interval to be no more than 1000&cent; (rather<br/>than 1650&cent;), only seven chords would have &quot;beat&quot; 4:5:6:7 and its mirror<br/>inversion. These are: 12:14:18:21, which has two perfect fifths; 5:6:8:9 and<br/>its mirror inversion, each of which has a perfect fifth and a perfect<br/>fourth; 6:8:9:10 and its mirror inversion, each of which has a perfect fifth<br/>and a perfect fourth; and, just by a hair, and the slightly tempered<br/>1/1:6/5:3/2:5/3 and its mirror inversion, each of which has a perfect fifth,<br/>a major third, and a major sixth . . . . Concerning this last chord, there<br/>was an error in my post:</p><p>&gt;The 18:25s in these chords are actually expanded relative to JI, to help<br/>them &gt;approximate the concordant 5:7.</p><p>That&apos;s right, but</p><p>&gt;These are thus pretty close to inversions of the 7-odd-limit tetrads</p><p>is not the case -- the corresponding interval in the inversions of the<br/>7-odd-limit tetrads would be a more discordant 7:10, rather than a 5:7.</p><p>Anyway, the six intervals in 1/1:6/5:3/2:5/3 (or its mirror inversion) are a<br/>perfect fifth, a minor third, a major third, a 5:7, a major sixth, and a<br/>9:10. Compared with 4:5:6:7 (or its mirror inversion), which has the same<br/>first four intervals, a 4:7, and a 6:7, the model chooses the former chord,<br/>because the harmonic entropy values are</p><p>major sixth -- 3.755<br/>4:7 -- 3.879<br/>6:7 -- 4.344<br/>10:9 -- 4.424</p><p>and 3.755+4.424=8.179 &lt; 3.879+4.344=8.223 (just barely, but with enough<br/>leeway to allow the tempering to take place).</p></div>
