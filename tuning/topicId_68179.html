AFAIK, this is<br/>easily testable fact, and one could simply measure the pitch of anyone<br/>claiming otherwise.</p><p>-A.</p><p>Johnny:  Man, you guys are funny.  &quot;Absolute zero pitch fluctuation&quot;?  Didn&apos;t you see the interactions between Ozan and myself?  Playing in a different tuning just means playing with a different set of relationships, and possibly with a new performance practice.</p><p>This can include the chucking of vibrato, the attempt to keep the tuning in the forefront of the mind.  One cannot fish for just relationships in Bach at the speed of Bach.  And yet, one can remain a musician and put some spin on notes for various reason.  The recorder, for example, is difficult to use dynamically.  If one overblows it goes sharp.  And yet there are different shadings, and alternative fingerings that provide different timbres, dynamics, nuances, etc.</p><p>However, in Werckmeister III there are no alternative fingerings.  Once an instrument is set in a new temperament, previous alternative fingerings then produce different pitches, which are unuseable in performance.</p><p>On the Early CD I put together pieces in a wide variety of keys so that there was ample room to hear differences in keys.  Music is music.  As Rudolf Rasch noted, there is always the heart beating jitter.</p><p>No one is claiming to be a scientist, only a musician.</p><p>all best, Johnny<br/>________________________________________________________________________<br/>Check out the new AOL.
