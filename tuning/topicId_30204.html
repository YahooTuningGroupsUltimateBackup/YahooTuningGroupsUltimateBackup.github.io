I&apos;ve never heard of a minor chord with a<br/>&gt; diminished seventh being used in classical music -- a minor chord<br/>&gt; with a major sixth would be common but be notated with a D# on top.<br/>&gt; But in 31-tET or 1/4-comma meantone, this chord would approximate<br/>&gt; extremely closely the string lengths 4:5:6:7. Perhaps Telemann knew<br/>&gt; this??? Anyone else have any thoughts about where Telemann would<br/>&gt; have pulled this chord from?</p><p>Thoughts I have...</p><p>Notice that if the C# were C natural then there would be a<br/>F#dim7 -&gt; B resolution. Not terribly common, but spelled<br/>correctly... This doesn&apos;t help at all with a JI<br/>interpretation, since a diminished chord is highly<br/>ambiguous in JI.</p><p>However, the voicing in this case would have been the<br/>following stack</p><p>diminished fifth  -&gt;  major third (usual resolution but displaced)<br/>minor third<br/>augmented fourth  -&gt;  atypical oblique resolution</p><p>Telemen may have thought the atypical oblique resolution may have<br/>needed some fixing. Or he may have not found having the two sizes<br/>of &apos;tritone&apos; so exposed to his tastes.</p><p>Or it could just be a melodic consideration, that he was hearing<br/>the diminished chord as tempered (illustration in cents)</p><p>1600  -&gt; 1586<br/>1000  -&gt; 1200<br/>700   -&gt;  702<br/>100   -&gt;    0</p><p>and felt the endpoints were two &apos;wiggly&apos; and that a bigger motion<br/>on the bottom voice would make it stronger and balance the A-&gt;B<br/>inner voice motion.</p><p>1600  -&gt; 1586<br/>1000  -&gt; 1200<br/>700   -&gt;  702<br/>200   -&gt;    0</p><p>Another thing that is suggested,, at least in 31, is that one<br/>could start with an Eb aug 6 (septimal seventh)</p><p>Eb  -&gt;  D#<br/>Bb  -&gt;  B<br/>G   -&gt;  F#<br/>C#  -&gt;  B</p><p>and then get confused or chicken out or dislike it. Then fixing<br/>the inner voices one would come up with what he did.</p><p>The guy was a genius and could have been thinking almost<br/>anything sensible or nonsensical when he came up with this.<br/>(This is another one for the tuning to-do list).</p><p>Bob Valentine</p></div>
