Interestingly enough, a very similar temperament can come<br/>&gt;&gt; out<br/>&gt;&gt; if we decide to temper out the difference between a perfect fourth plus<br/>&gt;&gt; two<br/>&gt;&gt; octaves on one side and 9 minor thirds on the other side (i.e.<br/>&gt;&gt; 1953125/1889568, or exponents of &quot;-5 -10 9&quot;). Although this interval is<br/>&gt;&gt; about 57 cents large, it can be very effectively distributed among many<br/>&gt;&gt; generators, giving a &quot;mistuning&quot; of about 6 cents for the generator (the<br/>&gt;&gt; slightly wider minor third) and only about 3 cents for the 3/1 and 5/1<br/>&gt;&gt; approximations, i.e., in the case of pure octaves. If we preserve the<br/>&gt;&gt; keemun<br/>&gt;&gt; 7-limit mapping, then the 7-limit comma tempered out is still the same<br/>&gt;&gt; 875/864 (a &quot;semi-diminished seventh&quot; of 7/4 minus three minor thirds of<br/>&gt;&gt; 6/5)<br/>&gt;&gt; and the 2,3,7-limit part tempers out the &quot;slendric&quot; 1029/1024 (i.e. a pure<br/>&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt; fifth of 3/2 minus three &quot;semi-augmented&quot; seconds of 8/7).
