And I think we need to archive tuning and<br/>tuning-math in its entirety, and lock that away on <a href="http://archive.org">archive.org</a> for all<br/>eternity. Everything on here is of fairly historical importance to<br/>music theory, I think.</p><p>-Mike</p></div><h3>genewardsmith &#x3C;genewardsmith@...&#x3E;</h3><span>1/23/2011 3:25:27 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, Mike Battaglia &lt;battaglia01@...&gt; wrote:</p><p>&gt; Right, I hope they do soon.
