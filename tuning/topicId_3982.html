I&apos;m not sure that it&apos;ll happen, but if<br/>it does, it would be kinda neat to look up Aussie tuning listers.  Also get<br/>suggestions on sights to see.  Anybody have any thoughts on that?</p><p>   It would probably be best to reply directly to me rather than to the<br/>list.</p><p>   Thanks a bunch!</p></div>
