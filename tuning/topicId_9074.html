One of my new works is &quot;Rama&quot; based on Arthur C. Clarke, and<br/>originally composed for trombone solo, is on the program.</p><p>I&apos;d like to share my experience with this piece, now played on bassoon.  It<br/>is in quadratic prime just intonation beginning on the 41st harmonic of a G<br/>1/1, lower than the conventional bassoon&apos;s low Bb.  I use a vacuum cleaner<br/>cylindrical tube and twist it in to the top of the bell, effectively giving a<br/>low G 1/1.</p><p>Reading the various Rama books, about a cylindrical space ship that makes<br/>repeat visits in the earth&apos;s future, I was inspired by some of the questions<br/>Clarke raised through his characters.</p><p>From Rama II (Bantam Books 1990) a character ask &quot;What comes first?  Do we<br/>use models to help us find the truth?  Or do we know the truth first, and<br/>then develop the mathematics to explain it?&quot;  The piece hopes to answer, and<br/>I believe it is succeeding. The answer appears to be both.</p><p>Clarke wrote that quadratic primes - 41, 43, 47, 53, 61, 71, 83, 97, etc.,<br/>were the intelligence system of the Rama aliens.  They used it to communicate<br/>with humans through computers they supplied in the ship.  &quot;Each successive<br/>number is computed by increasing the difference from the previous number by<br/>two, resulting in exactly forty consecutive prime dollars.  The sequence of<br/>primes ends only when the 41st number in the string turns out to be a<br/>nonprime, namely 41 X 41 = 1681.&quot;</p><p>My solo Rama uses an otonality that has the low B with the ratio 41/32, then<br/>a C at 43/41, a D at 47/43, E at 53/47 etc. up to a highest bassoon C at<br/>347/313</p><p>The utonality begins on the highest bassoon Eb at 1601/1024, D at 1601/1523,<br/>C# at 1523/1447, etc. all based on the Low G 1/1.  The bassoon fingerings are<br/>explicit and distinctive.  Clarke chose this quadratic prime range for a<br/>certain symmetry that exists between the 2 directions which is why I exploit<br/>the 2 full bassoon range JI arrays compositionally.</p><p>Like my piece Dune, each of the main characters or species are emphasized by<br/>particular tuning &quot;leitmotifs&quot; in that the music is idiosyncratically related<br/>to its subject.  There is a 7-TET involvement in whole tones at one point,<br/>and the swirling of the tube in bell is not to be underestimated for its<br/>effect with its swirling, and with the particular fingerings that are chosen<br/>because of its inherent distortion.  The piece requires the tube.  Amazingly,<br/>the tube brings me closer to hearing through the whole instrument and I can<br/>sing and play better than ever, because it is closer to my ears.</p><p>Now that I&apos;ve learned the piece, I practice up and down the new scales and<br/>they are amazing. However, the music is greater than the sum of its parts.</p><p>Johnny Reinhard</p></div><h3>Mats &#xFFFD;ljare &#x3C;oljare@hotmail.com&#x3E;</h3><span>3/5/2000 3:52:15 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Great to hear somebody else is working with this kind of mathematical basis.I&#xFFFD;d like to hear the piece some time,or some more info on your work.</p><p>&#xFFFD;&#xFFFD;&#xFFFD;&#xFFFD;&#xFFFD;&#xFFFD;&#xFFFD;&#xFFFD;&#xFFFD;&#xFFFD;&#xFFFD;&#xFFFD;&#xFFFD;&#xFFFD;&#xFFFD;&#xFFFD;&#xFFFD;&#xFFFD;&#xFFFD;&#xFFFD;&#xFFFD;&#xFFFD;&#xFFFD;&#xFFFD;&#xFFFD;&#xFFFD;&#xFFFD;&#xFFFD;&#xFFFD;&#xFFFD;&#xFFFD;&#xFFFD;&#xFFFD;&#xFFFD;&#xFFFD;&#xFFFD;&#xFFFD;&#xFFFD;&#xFFFD;&#xFFFD;&#xFFFD;&#xFFFD;&#xFFFD;&#xFFFD;&#xFFFD;&#xFFFD;&#xFFFD;&#xFFFD;&#xFFFD;&#xFFFD;&#xFFFD;&#xFFFD;&#xFFFD;&#xFFFD;&#xFFFD;&#xFFFD;&#xFFFD;&#xFFFD;&#xFFFD;&#xFFFD;&#xFFFD;&#xFFFD;&#xFFFD;&#xFFFD;&#xFFFD;&#xFFFD;&#xFFFD;&#xFFFD;&#xFFFD;&#xFFFD;<br/>Mats &#xFFFD;ljare<br/>Eskilstuna,Sweden<br/><a href="http://www.angelfire.com/mo/oljare">http://www.angelfire.com/mo/oljare</a><br/>______________________________________________________<br/>Get Your Private, Free Email at <a href="http://www.hotmail.com">http://www.hotmail.com</a></p></div>
