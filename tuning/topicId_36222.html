You are going to have to get used to the fact that not everyone loves a web interface for simple old text messages. Many, many people in business and technology dread HTML email, which is a bloat on the system and causes incompatibility problems.</p><p>I only want you to understand one thing: there are many ways to serve up information, and people have their own preferences. You&apos;ve expressed yours, and others will, and are, expressing theirs. Anyone can stay here at Yahoo, ads, dropouts, security problems, privacy issues, spam and all. When they ask for a subscription fee, or when they get out of &apos;groups&apos; business, then you can join any other list that may be up and running at that time.</p><p>As for forums like the Sibelius list, I don&apos;t think you realize how much programming it might take to run something dedicated like that, and we don&apos;t have anyone ready to do it for this group. What we *do* have is a free, reliable mailing list. Just like other lists where I (and this is *my* statement of preference) get tons of information in a fast and easy-to-use manner.</p><p>We&apos;ve discussed the lists. Join or not, Chris doesn&apos;t care. I won&apos;t say anything more about it unless you want to chat on metatuning...</p><p>Cheers,<br/>Jon</p></div><h3>jpehrson2 &#x3C;jpehrson@rcn.com&#x3E;</h3><span>4/4/2002 8:59:36 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In tuning@y..., &quot;jonszanto&quot; &lt;JSZANTO@A...&gt; wrote:</p><p><a href="http://groups.yahoo.com/group/tuning/message/36224">http://groups.yahoo.com/group/tuning/message/36224</a></p><p>&gt;<br/>&gt; We&apos;ve discussed the lists.
