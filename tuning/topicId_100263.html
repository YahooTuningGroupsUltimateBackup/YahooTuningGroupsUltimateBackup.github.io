Very nice, and I think it would be a good one to link from the JI scale page on the Xenwiki, because the scale is Terry Riley&apos;s Harp of New Albion scale. It&apos;s related to another scale you are familiar with, Centaur, since if you marvel temper it, and marvel temper Centaur, you end up at the same scale. If you are growing tired of the sourness of less accurate tempering, an alternative to JI is, of course, more accurate tempering. But of course you don&apos;t need to confine yourself to any one approach, and I like the fact that you seem in no danger of doing so.</p></div><h3>christopherv &#x3C;chrisvaisvil@...&#x3E;</h3><span>6/22/2011 8:09:47 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Thanks for the listen and comment.
