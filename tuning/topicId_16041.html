Perhaps Johnny can sell you a<br/>copy as a &quot;limited edition.&quot;</p><p>The whole question of recordings is as problematic for the AFMM as it<br/>is for everybody else.  As a physical object, they are incredibly<br/>expensive to manufacture.  That&apos;s why, of the, literally, THOUSANDS,<br/>of microtonal hours on DAT tapes that Johnny has, there is only  ONE<br/>AFMM CD, mostly featuring Joshua Pierce...</p><p>Johnny would LOVE to have more recordings out commercially, but it&apos;s<br/>of course the &quot;money, money, money&quot; issue, always...  And grants are<br/>VERY hard to procure for this, at least in NYC.</p><p>Maybe he can &quot;gear up&quot; for more &quot;limited edition&quot; kind of<br/>distribution, like several others on this list do...  Perhaps the<br/>&quot;demand&quot; will entice him, so you surely should ask when he gets back.<br/> If he&apos;s not going to sell them, I&apos;m sure he would make a special<br/>arrangement so you could get one.... (actually it would probably take<br/>about 7 or 8 CDs if you would like the entire event!!!)</p><p>Regarding the recording engineer matter...  If this is a real offer<br/>and you are willing to do it for free, I think Johnny would certainly<br/>go for it!  You don&apos;t live in New York, though (??)  There would be<br/>travelling and lodging involved, yes??</p><p>Otherwise, Greenspan is VERY inexpensive... although slow to make<br/>copies.  He&apos;s over 80 years old, but VERY sprightly and his hearing<br/>is excellent, fortunately.  He also has a great attitude about<br/>composers and new music, and keeps copies of all the works archived<br/>and catalogued, since he admires the music.</p><p>I will mention this to Johnny when he returns, if you don&apos;t get<br/>around to it...</p><p>Thanks!</p><p>Joe<br/>________ ___ __ __ _<br/>Joseph Pehrson, AFMM recording secretary, board officer, general<br/>factotum gopher</p></div><h3><a id=16043 href="#16043">ðŸ”—</a>Afmmjr@aol.com</h3><span>11/29/2000 2:31:04 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Thanks, John, for asking.

I would<br/>like to give caution about something that you might already be aware<br/>of - that any kind of magnetic media such as DAT (especially DAT),<br/>has a relatively short life span. And my experience has been that<br/>when DAT tape goes, it does not go gracefully. One day the music is<br/>there - the next it&apos;s gone or corrupted (and there&apos;s no fixing a<br/>corrupted DAT). At best, it&apos;s probably only going to be a reliable<br/>storage medium for about 10 years, and that&apos;s if your lucky. I&apos;ve<br/>seen DAT tapes corrupt in 5 years. I&apos;m sure you have got a real gold<br/>mine of material there too. It would be a most unfortunate loss if it<br/>were not able to be converted to an optical format (even this will go<br/>some day too), before the unpredictable end of the life of the tape<br/>creeps up one day (my experience firsthand). Nothing like that empty<br/>feeling of not being able to recover those magic moments.</p><p>Respectfully,</p><p>Jacky Ligon</p><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@egroups.com">tuning@egroups.com</a>, Afmmjr@a... wrote:<br/>&gt; Thanks, John, for asking.

In fact, *all* digital recordings need periodic<br/>conversion to the latest and greatest storage format if they are to survive.<br/>I&apos;m sure you&apos;ve heard stories of people who wanted to analyze the 1960<br/>Census data only to discover there were no working tape drives capable of<br/>reading 7-track half-inch IBM tapes any more. I think someone turned one up<br/>in Mexico finally -- at least that&apos;s the version of this urban legend that I<br/>heard. :-) So don&apos;t think, for example, that today&apos;s ubiquitous CD-ROM will<br/>live forever -- it won&apos;t. Sooner or later, the last drive capable of reading<br/>it will croak. :-( So when DVD-RW becomes economically feasible for us poor<br/>folk, make sure you convert your priceless CD-ROMs to DVD.<br/>--<br/>M.
