This morning, preparing to put the final touches on a paper<br/>I should soon by posting here (probably in two parts because of<br/>length), I was fascinated to see on reading Tuning Digest 700 that all<br/>of you, and especially Graham, were touching on some central themes of<br/>this paper. Of course, this is in part a reminder that these themes<br/>in turn owe much to the Tuning List, and it should be interesting to<br/>see how conventional or unconventional people regard my viewpoint when<br/>I post this article.</p><p>Anyway, here are a few responses as part of the current dialogue on<br/>53-tet, meantones, Xeno-Gothic and congenial n-tet&apos;s, etc.</p><p>Note that I&apos;ve attempted quickly to revise the opening of the first part<br/>for Monz and Paul after reading a new Tuning Digest (701) that just came<br/>in; my apologies for any possible errors or infelicities.</p><p>-------------------------------------------------------------<br/>1. For Monz and Paul: 53-tet and meantones -- yes, and 22-tet<br/>-------------------------------------------------------------</p><p>First of all, Monz, apart from the whole &quot;meantone&quot; issue on which you and<br/>Paul now seem in agreement, I agree, of course, that if we are looking for<br/>the closest possible emulation of Pythagorean (for whatever purpose), then<br/>53-tet (or some applicable subset, e.g. 24 of 53 for a usual Xeno-Gothic<br/>mapping on two keyboard) is the obvious choice. It&apos;s further correct, of<br/>course, that 53-tet has &quot;schisma thirds&quot; of a near-5-limit size almost<br/>identical to the Pythagorean variety used in the early 15th century, as<br/>well as &quot;septimal schisma&quot; intervals varying a &quot;comma&quot; (1/53 octave) from<br/>their regular Pythagorean flavors in the opposite direction.</p><p>At the same time, Paul (and Monz), I agree that if we take &quot;meantone&quot; in<br/>its traditional historical sense to imply &quot;a scale where fifths are<br/>tempered on the narrow side so that four of them form a pure or near-pure<br/>5-limit major third,&quot; then 53-tet is _not_ a 5-limit meantone<br/>approximation.</p><p>A very simple way of demonstrating this is to note that in 53-tet<br/>treated as a 5-limit approximation, a ~5:4 major third will be 17<br/>steps. Now 17 is an odd number, and cannot be divided into two<br/>&quot;mean-tones&quot; of equal integer size which together produce this<br/>third.</p><p>Instead we have what you have nicely described as an emulation of<br/>classic 16th-century just intonation (JI) based on Ptolemy&apos;s syntonic<br/>diatonic, with large whole-steps at ~9:8 (9 steps) and small ones at<br/>~10:9 (8 steps), a la Fogliano and Zarlino. Together, these two<br/>unequal whole-tones do form a near-pure major third, just as a 9:8 and<br/>a 10:9 together produce a 5:4.</p><p>If we want a 53-tet-like tuning that _does_ support meantone in the<br/>usual sense, then maybe 106-tet would be an ideal solution. Here our<br/>near-5:4 major third would be 34 steps, so that a mean-tone of 17<br/>steps (the mean of 9/53 octave and 8/53 octave) would indeed answer to<br/>your requirements. This mean-tone is ~192.45 cents, very slightly<br/>smaller than the whole-tone in 1/4-comma meantone (~193.16 cents)<br/>because our 53-tet or 106-tet &quot;schisma third,&quot; like its Pythagorean<br/>counterpart, is slightly narrower than 5:4.</p><p>Of course, if we take &quot;meantone&quot; in the broadest generic sense as a<br/>regular tuning (all regular fifths equal), and consider Pythagorean as<br/>&quot;zero-comma meantone,&quot; then 53-tet is an excellent meantone. We have a<br/>whole-tone of 9 steps, and two make a major third (or ditone) of 18<br/>steps, an almost exact emulation of the Pythagorean 81:64.</p><p>This is the framework in which I tend to look at 53-tet, in which<br/>those intervals of 17 steps are &quot;schisma thirds.&quot; In fact, I remark in<br/>a footnote in my paper that from a Pythagorean point of view, people<br/>who use 53-tet as a 5-limit JI system are redefining the schisma<br/>thirds as regular thirds.</p><p>Curiously, while writing my paper, I realized that there is another<br/>n-tet which has a close analogy with 1/4-comma meantone, with a<br/>whole-tone almost at the mean between two integer ratios, but forming<br/>a different flavor of major third. Which scale? -- yes, it&apos;s no other<br/>than 22-tet, taken in a neo-Gothic manner.</p><p>In this interpretation, we have whole-tones of 4 steps (~218.18<br/>cents), just slightly larger than the mean between 9:8 and 8:7; and<br/>two of these &quot;mean-tones&quot; make a regular 22-tet major third just a tad<br/>larger than a pure 9:7 (8 steps, ~436.36 cents). When I recognized<br/>this yesterday, I saw the analogy with 1/4-comma and its mean-tone<br/>between a 9:8 and a 10:9 so that two make a 5:4.</p><p>This example also shows how in n-tet&apos;s, the number of steps in<br/>whole-tones and semitones can depend on your musical and stylistic<br/>viewpoint. To me, from a neo-Gothic viewpoint where major thirds in<br/>the region of 81:64 to 9:7 expanding to fifths are a prime attraction,<br/>22-tet is a regular tuning, indeed a close approximation of an exact<br/>&quot;meantone&quot; based on the 9:7 (as 31-tet is very close to 1/4-comma).<br/>From a decatonic viewpoint, or some other viewpoint than a<br/>3-stability-limit (neo-Gothic) one, the step counting for intervals as<br/>well as musical style would be quite different, as your article in<br/>_Xenharmonikon_ 17 shows.</p><p>----------------------------------------<br/>2. For Graham -- n-tet&apos;s and Xeno-Gothic<br/>----------------------------------------</p><p>Thank you for some very perspicacious and intriguing comments which<br/>very much share a major focus of my forthcoming paper: the use of<br/>&quot;neo-Gothic tunings and temperaments&quot; including n-tet&apos;s where the<br/>fifths are either pure (or minutely smaller in 53-tet) or wider than<br/>pure.</p><p>Thank you for the very important insight that lots of Xeno-Gothic<br/>progressions (conceived in Pythagorean 24, but indeed &quot;portable&quot; to<br/>many n-tet&apos;s, with fascinating shades of variation) don&apos;t involve<br/>&quot;near-5-limit&quot; ratios at all.</p><p>Near-5-limit schisma thirds (Pythagorean diminished fourths and<br/>augmented seconds) are important in early 15th-century music, and so<br/>are part of the Xeno-Gothic mix, but I would say that thirds modified<br/>in the opposite direction (even more active and dynamic than<br/>Pythagorean) may be at least equally important and a better clue to<br/>what Xeno-Gothic or neo-Gothic is really about.</p><p>In fact, I&apos;m much attracted to temperaments (equal and otherwise)<br/>which have fifths reasonably close to 3:2 on the wide size, but no<br/>close approximations of simple 5-limit intervals, at least within the<br/>subset that I&apos;m likely regularly to use. Here I say &quot;simple&quot; 5-limit<br/>intervals, because the diatonic semitone of 17-tet (1 step, ~70.59<br/>cents) could be viewed as an excellent ~25:24, the _chromatic_<br/>semitone of 5-limit &lt;grin&gt;.</p><p>While your latest post and my almost-completed paper focus on some of<br/>the same tunings (17-tet, 29-tet, 41-tet, 53-tet), you discuss a point<br/>I really don&apos;t get into, and which is definitely worth lots of<br/>attention in musical practice and theory: comma size, especially in<br/>relation to commas as melodic intervals.</p><p>As you point out, as fifths get larger than pure, the comma<br/>(difference between diatonic and chromatic semitones) rapidly gets<br/>larger also. It&apos;s interesting that you find 41-tet, where this comma<br/>is around 29 cents, as a point where it becomes more of a clear<br/>&quot;melodic elaboration.&quot; I wonder if there could be a connection here<br/>with the question of when people starting hearing an interval as a<br/>very small minor second rather an imprecise unison.</p><p>In 29-tet, the comma is around 41 cents, interestingly very close to<br/>the diesis of 1/4-comma meantone which Vicentino uses in his<br/>&quot;enharmonic&quot; music. This tuning, and others in the general vicinity<br/>with slightly larger fifths, thus somewhat resemble Renaissance<br/>meantones in having a dramatic contrast between the size of the two<br/>semitones, say around 40-60 cents (with the _diatonic_ semitone<br/>smaller in neo-Gothic and the chromatic one in usual meantone, of<br/>course). Making the most of this feature in a neo-Gothic setting, as<br/>Renaissance keyboard composers did with their meantone chromaticism<br/>(and Vicentino&apos;s &quot;enharmonicism&quot; using the diesis as a melodic<br/>interval), is a fascinating theme for new music as well as theory.</p><p>Your mention of 135-tet is a good alert to the limitations of only<br/>considering n-tet&apos;s through 53, an arbitrary limitation of my paper,<br/>and also raises very interesting questions about the ways different<br/>people view n-tet&apos;s in general -- topics for lots more dialogue.</p><p>Most appreciatively,</p><p>Margo Schulter<br/><a href="mailto:mschulter@value.net">mschulter@value.net</a></p></div><h3><a id=11091 href="#11091">ðŸ”—</a>graham@microtonal.co.uk</h3><span>7/7/2000 9:41:00 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>In-Reply-To: &lt;<a href="mailto:Pine.BSF.4.20.0007061350010.59696-100000@value.net">Pine.BSF.4.20.0007061350010.59696-100000@value.net</a>&gt;<br/>Margo Schulter wrote:</p><p>&gt; Thank you for the very important insight that lots of Xeno-Gothic<br/>&gt; progressions (conceived in Pythagorean 24, but indeed &quot;portable&quot; to<br/>&gt; many n-tet&apos;s, with fascinating shades of variation) don&apos;t involve<br/>&gt; &quot;near-5-limit&quot; ratios at all.</p><p>Well, you&apos;ll know about the &quot;lots&quot;, I only know the one you showed us<br/>before.</p><p>&gt; As you point out, as fifths get larger than pure, the comma<br/>&gt; (difference between diatonic and chromatic semitones) rapidly gets<br/>&gt; larger also.

That is, the cutoff is between a 41st and 53rd part of an octave.<br/> It happens to be a lot closer to 53.  I find Pythagorean, or at least the<br/>perfect 702 cent fifth, tuning to have an adequate comma.  It takes a bit<br/>of getting used to, but doesn&apos;t have the troubling quality of 53=.  That<br/>means the exact point must be somewhere between 22.6 and 24.0 cents (or my<br/>synthesizer&apos;s approximations thereof).</p><p>These are conclusions I came to a while ago, and follow from my first<br/>impressions after setting up the schismic keyboard tuning.  I&apos;ve mostly<br/>avoided the flat-fifth tunings since.</p><p>&gt; Your mention of 135-tet is a good alert to the limitations of only<br/>&gt; considering n-tet&apos;s through 53, an arbitrary limitation of my paper,<br/>&gt; and also raises very interesting questions about the ways different<br/>&gt; people view n-tet&apos;s in general -- topics for lots more dialogue.</p><p>Oh, I think 53 is already on the high side for an ET. 135-equal is purely<br/>a convenience for calculation.  A just 7:4 leads to a 1/44.9 oct comma, so<br/>setting it to 1/45 oct is an obvious simplification.  That happens to<br/>define 135= where the semitones are 7, 10 and 13 steps.  Which means the<br/>whole tuning can be described in terms of integers, keeping the arithmetic<br/>nice and easy.</p><p>A just 7:4 means the 9-limit is accurate to within 5 cents, and the 3.3.7<br/>subset to within 0.6 cents.</p><p>                    Graham</p></div>
