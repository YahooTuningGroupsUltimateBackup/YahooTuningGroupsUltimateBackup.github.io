As Judith points<br/>out, they&apos;re traditional and if only sharps are split these fill the<br/>same depth and breadth as a Halberstadt-style chromatic keyboard yet<br/>without disturbing the visual/tactile arrangement. The height of the<br/>additional keys is a function of the dip required by an instrument -<br/>keys that &apos;bury&apos; are annoying (a serious handicap to sharps split across<br/>their widths, for instance as extrapolated by Jack Peters from a Zarlino<br/>print in a tiny 19-tone instrument: &lt;<a href="http://jackpeters.com/">http://jackpeters.com/</a>&gt;).</p><p>I think, for the most part, antique split key arrangements were not<br/>intended to close tunings, but rather to remove wolves a little further<br/>from common practice. One late example, a 1766 square piano by Zumpe<br/>(Harding, &quot;The Piano-Forte&quot; p69) appears to permit 17 tones per octave,<br/>but closer inspection shows several dummy keys at either end of the<br/>compass. This would concur with the practice of short octaves*<br/>originally which omitted accidentals (Marcuse, &quot;A Survey of Musical<br/>Instruments&quot; p236).</p><p>* A friend related a story that a harpsichordist visiting his shop said<br/>something like &quot;Short octave - why, if anything this keyboard has wider<br/>octaves than normal!&quot;</p><p>If the elegance of split sharps is their minimal intrusion, split<br/>naturals are a little messy depending on the extent and manner of their<br/>integration. Nested between sharps they&apos;re always buried and their<br/>reduction in width requires more precision of a player (and builder!).<br/>Placed before naturals, the depth of the keyboard may be increased - the<br/>same as for what seems the most common approach, in setting them behind<br/>the chromatic keyboard, nearly as separate manuals (which, in the case<br/>of the Sambuca lincea, they kind of are [Martin, &quot;The Colonna-Stella<br/>Samuca lincea&quot; JAMIS v.10, p5-21]).</p><p>Additional notes present mechanical challenges whatever device is used<br/>to introduce them. I built (it says 1999 on the name board but still<br/>it&apos;s not finished...) an obliquely-strung virginal because the stringing<br/>scheme permits strike (pluck) bands to be wider than might offset<br/>keyplank back-scales, and shared jack-slots don&apos;t alter plucking<br/>lengths. Its crazy keyboard has 22-tones per octave throughout its<br/>3-octaves and a fourth compass, with a normal, ~165mm octave span, split<br/>sharps, and split C&apos;s, E&apos;s, F&apos;s, G&apos;s, and B&apos;s. This is playable, if not<br/>exactly comfortable - the instrument has other problems as well, so I<br/>hope it&apos;s just an early attempt...</p><p>Harding reports a root-controller piano invented by Clagget in 1788<br/>called the Telio-chordon: &quot;Every octave could be divided into<br/>thirty-nine gradations of sound and any key could be made to sound one<br/>of these degrees of intonation. In order to produce these variations he<br/>added two extra bridges placed nearer to the hammers,&quot; between(? she<br/>writes above) which were placed bars that could be lowered by means of<br/>pedals to engage the alternate speaking lengths. (Clagget and Dr. K.<br/>Chr. Fr. Krause each had keyboards with keys identically-shaped and all<br/>in the same plane, the latter without color cues)</p><p>Eivind Groven designed two related instruments, one an organ still in<br/>use in Oslo, the other an unfinished piano which made use of switching<br/>arrays to select between 36 (JI) tones from three separate instruments.<br/>David Loberg Code continues this work using MIDI-equipped,<br/>solenoid-driven player pianos &lt;<a href="http://eeyore.cc.wmich.edu/~code/groven/">http://eeyore.cc.wmich.edu/~code/groven/</a>&gt;<br/>(The same, or a similar system was used to perform Antheil&apos;s &quot;Ballet<br/>Mechanique&quot; with a mass of pianos).</p><p>While these devices are limited only to 12 simultaneously available<br/>notes, Yamaha proposes in US Patent no. 5516981 a 19-tone keyboard<br/>through logic which can switch between 12- and 19tET (from John<br/>Chalmers&apos; links page at<br/>&lt;<a href="http://www.ixpres.com/interval/chalmers/links.htm">http://www.ixpres.com/interval/chalmers/links.htm</a>&gt;).</p><p>A microtonal Rhodes would be super, but where to get parts?</p><p>Clark</p></div>
