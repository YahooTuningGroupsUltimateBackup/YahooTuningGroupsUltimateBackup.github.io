A frequency domain plot<br/>is also known as a spectra plot.</p><p>The Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) is a computationally efficient<br/>implementation of the Fourier Transform developed by J.W.

The Fast Fourier Transform is limited to block<br/>sizes which are even powers of 2.</p><p>For example, if a FFT is performed on a pure sinusoidal signal, the<br/>resulting spectra would be single peak (line).

I don&apos;t remember any<br/>names at the moment, but I&apos;m sure if you give &quot;wavelet&quot; and &quot;sound&quot; to a<br/>search engine you&apos;ll find plenty on the web. But the FFT is still the<br/>workhorse of digital signal processing. CSound has two types of sound<br/>analysis built in, phase vocoder analysis and linear predictive coding.<br/>There is also a free program called SNDAN which uses phase vocoder analysis<br/>and something called McAaulay-Quatieri analysis. SNDAN is free for Windows<br/>at</p><p><a href="http://www.bath.ac.uk/~masjpf/NCD/software/sndan/sndan.html">http://www.bath.ac.uk/~masjpf/NCD/software/sndan/sndan.html</a></p><p>The Composers Desktop Project also contains sound analysis capabilities.<br/>Their URL is</p><p><a href="http://www.bath.ac.uk/~masjpf/CDP/CDP.htm">http://www.bath.ac.uk/~masjpf/CDP/CDP.htm</a></p><p>In general, given a steady-state signal or a mathematical function in any<br/>number of dimensions, one typically tries to find a parsimonious<br/>representation of it -- a representation with as few terms as possible --<br/>using some form of truncated infinite series. The fewer terms the better,<br/>and both wavelets and Fourier series are possibilities depending on the<br/>nature of what you&apos;re trying to analyze. Tschebycheff polynomials are also<br/>good in some circumstances; they are related to discrete cosine transforms<br/>and can usually be computed with a variant of the FFT.</p><p>*However*, the complex time-varying signals from natural sounds and music<br/>pretty much rule out a parsimonious representation regardless of what<br/>analytical techniques you choose to apply. None of the techniques work very<br/>well on noise, for example. It is still not possible with reasonably<br/>inexpensive computing technology to play a recording of, say, Shostakovich&apos;s<br/>4th symphony, and derive the score from the sound computationally.<br/>--<br/>M.

It analyzes AIFF<br/>sample files to produce an intermediate representation (a Lemur analysis<br/>file), and uses these analysis files to synthesize AIFF sample files.<br/>Time scaling, frequency scaling, and frequency shifting, and magnitude<br/>scaling are possible. All may be time-variant, and all but time scaling<br/>may be applied selectively to the different frequency components of the<br/>sound.<br/>Lemur analysis consists of a series of short-time Fourier spectra<br/>from which significant frequency components are selected. Similar<br/>components in successive spectra are linked to form time-varying<br/>partials, called tracks. The number of significant frequency components,<br/>and, thus, the number of tracks may vary over the duration of a sound.<br/>Synthesis is performed by a bank of oscillators, each oscillator<br/>reproducing the frequency and amplitude trajectory of a single track.<br/>Phase accuracy is maintained using cubic phase (parabolic frequency)<br/>interpolation between spectra. The Lemur model allows extensive<br/>modification of the sound using Lemur&apos;s built-in editing functions, or<br/>using other customized editors to modify the intermediate analysis file<br/>before resynthesis. The Lemur file format contains only amplitude,<br/>frequency, and linking information for each track, making it easy for<br/>users to write customized Lemur file editors.</p><p>Lemur Pro will run on any Macintosh with System 7 and a floating<br/>point math coprocessor (68881 or 68882), AND on any Power<br/>Macintosh.

Bill Sethares does quite a bit with additive synthesis.<br/>The examples in his book are much closer to pure &quot;FFT music&quot; than some<br/>others.
