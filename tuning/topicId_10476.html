In this case the &quot;real-number&quot; system would be the standard<br/>notes of the tuning, and the &quot;complex&quot; system these notes plus or<br/>minus any desired deviation -- in other words, any intermediate<br/>values.</p><p>From this point of view, for example, we might interpret 12-tet as a<br/>variation on a 17-note Pythagorean scale (Gb-A#); each 12-tet<br/>accidental might have two possible mappings, for example the C#/Db key<br/>as a deviation from Pythagorean C# or Db.</p><p>For example, 12-tet E might be notated as &quot;6 - 7.82i&quot; -- the seventh note<br/>of a 17-note Pythagorean series 0-16</p><p>(C,Db,C#,D,Eb,D#,E,F,Gb,F#,G,Ab,G#,A,Bb,A#,B)</p><p>with a deviation of -7.82 cents from an 81:64 major third in relation to<br/>C.</p><p>Most respectfully,</p><p>Margo Schulter<br/><a href="mailto:mschulter@value.net">mschulter@value.net</a></p></div>
