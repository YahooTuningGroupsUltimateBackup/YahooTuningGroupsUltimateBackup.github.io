It is probably a logical thing to do to divide 12-tones into<br/>another 6 parts, since that shows the continuation of the same<br/>symmetry. One of your observations made me realize something very<br/>important that I completely forgot, which I wrote down myself. I am<br/>ashamed to say, but I forgot one important point. I remembered it<br/>when you mentioned Just Intonation. The reason that Murzin decided to<br/>invent the ANS synthesizer was that Murzin wanted to continue<br/>Scriabin&apos;s aspiration toward not only intervals smaller than the<br/>semitone, but also &quot;natural&quot; intervals, i.e. those pertaining to<br/>Just Intonation. In the interview that I did with Stanislav Kreichi,<br/>he mentions that Murzin wanted to incorporate pure intervals,<br/>pertaining to Just Intonation, and not merely to double or triple<br/>standard 12-tone equal temperament intervals with quarter-tones or<br/>eighth-tones. Very silly of me to forget. Protopopoff, on the other<br/>hand, never got that far in his thinking (nor did he get as far in<br/>his book as 72-tET. He merely made a dive into the nearest microtonal<br/>temperaments available at his disposal - namely quarter-tones, third-<br/>tones and sixth-tones - to prove that Yavorsky&apos;s system is universal<br/>and can be applied to all music, from the &quot;music of the past&quot;, i.e.<br/>folk music, to the &quot;music of the future&quot; i.e. microtonal music. If he<br/>instinctively paved the way towards 72-tET, I think that this was done<br/>irrationally, without any conscious thought of 72-tET or the Just<br/>Intonation harmonies that are derived from it. It might show<br/>the &quot;inherently dominant&quot; qualities of 72-tET, to which composers and<br/>theorists aspire without even realizing it consciously.</p><p>You can post this response on the Tuning List. I will really try to<br/>get back to it as soon as possible.</p><p>Best,</p><p>Anton</p></div>
