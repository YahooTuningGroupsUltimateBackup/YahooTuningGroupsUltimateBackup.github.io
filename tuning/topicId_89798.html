Meantone is whatever they used for meantone, but it could be meanquar.scl. Pythagorean could be pyth.scl, pyth_12.scl, zwolle.scl, or ling-lun.scl, which are transpostions of the same scale.

Dunno... As far as I am concerned that &lt; than 2 cents different G is something that I can hear.Which reminds me of another strange thing -- the f#.&nbsp; I generally prefer all the just notes except for the f# where I find the good-ol square-root-of-2 more consonant -- mystifies me.<br/>The</p><p>problem is that the major thirds are ~14 cents sharp.
