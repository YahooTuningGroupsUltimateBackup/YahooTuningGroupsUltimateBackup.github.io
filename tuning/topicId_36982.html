In this case a music reviewer who from what i<br/>can tell would have been happy if the whole thing might have been some<br/>laser show with music and lights and visuals that never had a life of<br/>there own.<br/>    If i told you my last visual element was a burning ghost with a<br/>plane that flays out toward the audience you would wonder how the<br/>reviewer could see this as silly. That he failed to see how we tricked<br/>him into seeing this most horrible of image in a new light and context<br/>where such a thing is positive or given a positive meaning within the<br/>story. Our attempt to rob the terrorist of their &quot;image&quot; and make it<br/>into something of our own with a new meaning. possibly we did our job<br/>too well, the reviewer no longer remembered what this image meant before<br/>the show!</p><p>- Kraig Grady<br/>North American Embassy of Anaphoria island<br/> <a href="http://www.anaphoria.com">http://www.anaphoria.com</a></p><p>The Wandering Medicine Show<br/>Wed. 8-9 KXLU 88.9 fm</p></div>
