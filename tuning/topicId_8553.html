Of course, my attitudes<br/>toward meantone may be influenced by that the fact that for me it _is_<br/>my &quot;common practice&quot; for Renaissance and Manneristic music, along with<br/>Pythagorean for medieval music. People who mostly compose or play in<br/>other styles may have different views of what is &quot;natural&quot; or<br/>&quot;pleasing,&quot; something only to be expected on a Tuning List as diverse<br/>as this one.</p><p>Here I&apos;d like specifically to comment on the items in Paul&apos;s table<br/>listing Pietro Aaron (1523) as the first to describe 1/4-comma<br/>meantone, and Nicola Vicentino (1555) as the first to describe 31-tone<br/>equal temperament (31-tet). In the first case, I agree with Paul and<br/>various other scholars, although noting Mark Lindley&apos;s divergent view<br/>on this point. With Vicentino and 31-tet, to borrow from the title of<br/>a famous book by Peter Abelard, one might reply _Sic et non_, &quot;Yes and<br/>no.&quot; Drawing the Vicentino/31-tet connection involves a bit of<br/>&quot;kludging,&quot; but simply to omit it could be taken as at least equally<br/>misleading.</p><p>In defense of Paul, I&apos;d like to begin by recognizing that two leading<br/>scholars of musical Mannerism in the 16th century, Maria Rika Maniates<br/>and Claude Palisca, _have_ identified Vicentino&apos;s first tuning of his<br/>36-note archicembalo with 31-tet, as did Lemme Rossi in 1666.</p><p>Similarly, various books on Renaissance music and tuning (including<br/>Owen Jorgensen&apos;s) _have_ equated Aaron&apos;s meantone temperament<br/>described in his _Toscanello in Musica_ (1523) specifically with a<br/>1/4-comma tuning.</p><p>Let&apos;s look at both cases, and see the complications that arise with<br/>Vicentino, and also Mark Lindley&apos;s argument that Aaron&apos;s tuning of<br/>1523 does not necessarily specify a regular 1/4-comma temperament<br/>for all intervals, although he is ready to agree that it describes<br/>this tuning for the first five notes C-G-D-A-E.</p><p>-------------------------------------------------------<br/>1. Vicentino: 31-tone quasi-equal temperament (31-tqet)<br/>-------------------------------------------------------</p><p>We find that Vicentino indeed describes a tuning dividing each<br/>whole-tone into five &quot;minor dieses&quot; or fifthtones, as I call them,<br/>which he apparently regards as equal or equivalent. This does<br/>precisely fit the concept of 31-tet. At the same time, however, he<br/>notes that the first 12 notes of the tuning (Eb-G#) are tuned as on<br/>usual keyboard instruments. This suggests the likelihood that his<br/>conceptually equal fifthtones were realized as an _almost_ equal<br/>31-note meantone based on pure major thirds -- in other words,<br/>1/4-comma temperament.</p><p>However -- and this is worth checking out further -- I seem to recall<br/>that at at some point, Vicentino describes his alternative tuning of<br/>19-note meantone (Gb-B#) plus the second manual of his instrument in<br/>pure fifths with these notes as realizing Ptolemy&apos;s syntonic diatonic<br/>-- in other words, 5-limit just intonation for vertical sonorities. If<br/>so, he implies a basic meantone temperament with pure major thirds, or<br/>1/4-comma. (This is the &quot;adaptive JI&quot; approach discussed here a great deal<br/>in recent digests, and also advocated by Paul, thus &quot;Vicentino/Erlich&quot;).</p><p>Here a problem of interpretation for anyone drawing up a brief chart<br/>is that in Vicentino&apos;s time, the very slight difference between a<br/>meantone with precisely equal fifthtones (31-tet) and a meantone with<br/>pure major thirds (1/4-comma) might not have been a consideration. If<br/>we take a 17th-century or later mathematical approach which takes<br/>account of this difference, then &quot;31-tet&quot; may imply a deliberate<br/>albeit minute tempering of the major third in order to obtain<br/>_precisely_ equal fifthtones.</p><p>One possible solution for a brief table might be to invent a new<br/>acronym, and say that Vicentino introduced &quot;31-tqet&quot; -- 31-tone<br/>quasi-equal temperament. Because he is so important in the history of<br/>the 31-division of the octave (precisely or _almost_ equal), I<br/>wouldn&apos;t want to omit him, and 31-tqet permits his &quot;mathematically<br/>correct&quot; inclusion.</p><p>Again, I want to see if I can find that passage where Vicentino may<br/>speak of his second tuning as producing the &quot;syntonic diatonic.&quot; That<br/>would indicate pure major thirds -- and might also, to anticipate the<br/>next point, be taken as one of the first descriptions of the 1/4-comma<br/>temperament.</p><p>---------------------------------------------<br/>2. Aaron&apos;s 1/4-comma meantone -- how regular?<br/>---------------------------------------------</p><p>As for Aaron, the most judicious statement might be that he is indeed<br/>the first to describe a process for dividing an apparently pure major<br/>third into four equally narrowed or tempered fifths which, if<br/>continued regularly throughout a tuning, _will_ result in a 1/4-comma<br/>temperament. For many people, that is enough. Mark Lindley, however,<br/>prefers to emphasize the caution that Aaron does not in his tuning<br/>instructions specify that all fifths and major thirds should be<br/>tempered in the same way -- although he does not exclude such a choice<br/>either. See his &quot;Early Sixteenth-century Keyboard Temperaments,&quot;<br/>_Musica Disciplina_ 28:129-151 (1974), with pp. 139-144 on Aaron. Here<br/>one might want to compare the translation in Pietro Aaron, _Toscanello<br/>in Musica_ (vol. 3): Book II, Chapters XXXVII-XXXX; Supplement_, Peter<br/>Bergquest, tr., Colorado College Music Translations 4 (Colorado<br/>Springs, 1970), pp. 10-11.</p><p>Aaron, writing an introduction to music in Italian (_Toscanello_ is a<br/>title honoring his native Tuscany), advises the not necessarily<br/>experienced reader to start by making the octave C-C &quot;just,&quot; and then<br/>the major third C-E &quot;sonorous and just, as united as possible.&quot; While<br/>Aaron does not specify a pure 5:4 for the major third, this seems to<br/>me a natural reading of &quot;sonorous and just.&quot; Then the fifths C-G-D-A-E<br/>are tuned so that each is slightly &quot;flat&quot; or &quot;lacking,&quot; and each by<br/>the same amount. For example, A should be the same &quot;distance&quot; from D<br/>as from E -- in other words, the fifths D-A and A-E should be tempered<br/>from &quot;perfection&quot; by the same quantity.</p><p>As far as I&apos;m concerned, this is enough to justify listing Aaron&apos;s<br/>instructions as a description the procedure for obtaining 1/4-comma<br/>meantone -- as various authors have done, and Paul does in his table.<br/>Further, Aaron adds after his C-G-D-A-E series of fifths that F should<br/>be tuned by a similar but opposite procedure, making F in the fifth<br/>F-C &quot;a little high, passing a bit beyond perfection.&quot; If one assumes<br/>symmetry, then 1/4-comma meantone indeed results.</p><p>Correctly pointing out that Aaron&apos;s instructions do not give a<br/>mathematical description of 1/4-comma meantone, or explicitly direct<br/>that all major thirds be made pure, Lindley raises the question of<br/>what Aaron means by his statement that &quot;thirds and sixths are blunted<br/>or diminished&quot; in this temperament.</p><p>One interpretation which occurs to me is that Aaron is comparing<br/>meantone _major_ thirds and sixths with the same intervals in a<br/>Pythagorean tuning with pure fifths -- where they are indeed somewhat<br/>larger. Lindley emphasizes such ambiguous statements to argue that<br/>Aaron&apos;s instructions do specify 1/4-comma for the first notes<br/>C-G-D-A-E, but might lend themselves to various slightly irregular<br/>tunings for the other fifths and thirds.</p><p>Another point made by Lindley is that Aaron uses the adjective<br/>_giusta_ (&quot;just&quot;) to refer not only to his initial octave and major<br/>third (where &quot;pure&quot; is an attractive reading), but also for the<br/>temperament as a whole -- _participatione &amp; acordo giusto &amp; buono_, &quot;a<br/>just and good temperament and tuning.&quot; However, Lindley himself is<br/>ready to accept Aaron&apos;s opening C-G-D-A-E with its &quot;sonorous and just&quot;<br/>major third C-E as a description of 1/4-comma. His statement about the<br/>octave C-C and major third C-E being as sonorous or &quot;united&quot; as<br/>possible would support this conclusion even we assume that &quot;just&quot; may<br/>mean simply &quot;euphonious&quot; or &quot;pleasing.&quot;</p><p>In his instructions for the final stage of the temperament, the tuning<br/>of the sharps, Aaron directs that C#, tuned in relation to the fifth<br/>A-E, should be a major third from A and a minor third from E, and<br/>likewise with F# in relation to the fifth D-A, etc.</p><p>From one viewpoint, this language may simply be reminding the student<br/>of the locations of major and minor thirds involving accidentals.<br/>Lindley, however, pursuing his argument that a regular 1/4-comma<br/>temperament is not _necessarily_ implied, argues that one _could_ read<br/>this language to suggest something like Zarlino&apos;s 2/7-comma meantone<br/>for the temperament of the sharps, with major and minor thirds<br/>compromised by about the same amount from pure.</p><p>In arguing that Aaron&apos;s tuning is not _necessarily_ a regular<br/>1/4-comma meantone, Lindley may have two motivations. First, he wishes<br/>to emphasize that Aaron&apos;s instructions are not mathematically precise;<br/>and indeed, I would agree that Zarlino (1571) and Salinas (1577) may<br/>be the first known theorists to give such mathematical definitions of<br/>1/4-comma and other meantone temperaments.</p><p>Secondly, Lindley wants to correct the view that 1/4-comma was a<br/>universal standard in the 16th century. Since Aaron&apos;s instructions are<br/>often taken as the paradigm case of this tuning, showing that they are<br/>actually open to more than one interpretation would fit with his<br/>larger campaign against &quot;1/4-comma hegemony.&quot;</p><p>However, I find it noteworthy that without invoking any complex<br/>mathematical concepts or even defining a syntonic comma, Aaron has<br/>described in what I find beautiful as well as musicianly terms the<br/>idea of tuning a pure major third and then dividing it into four<br/>equally tempered fifths. Aaron&apos;s remaining instructions, including his<br/>suggestion of a similar but opposite tempering of fifths in the flat<br/>direction (F-C, and then Bb-F and Eb-Bb), permit a regular 1/4-comma<br/>temperament, even if they do not compel it or define it in<br/>mathematical terms.</p><p>If I were making a table like Paul&apos;s, I might list Aaron for 1/4-comma<br/>and add a footnote or annotation like this:</p><p>&quot;Aaron evidently describes a temperament with a pure major third C-E<br/>and equally narrowed fifths for his first five notes C-G-D-A-E, with<br/>further instructions permitting but not explicitly specifying that<br/>other major thirds are pure; Zarlino (1571) and Salinas (1577) give<br/>mathematically precise descriptions of a regular 1/4-comma tuning.&quot;</p><p>Anyway, having shared my annotations, I would add that I might feel<br/>uneasy about a table of meantone tunings avoiding these issues by<br/>omitting Aaron and Vicentino.</p><p>Most respectively,</p><p>Margo Schulter<br/><a href="mailto:mschulter@value.net">mschulter@value.net</a></p></div><h3><a id=8565 href="#8565">ðŸ”—</a>Paul H.
