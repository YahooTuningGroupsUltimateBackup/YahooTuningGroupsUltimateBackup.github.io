But in the Graphical Mode, the<br/>desired pitch is not a scale tone, rather it is given graphically by you and<br/>is called the &quot;target pitch function&quot;.<br/>...</p><p>In Graphical Mode, the user draws the target pitch function using line and<br/>curve drawing tools.</p><p>The graphical mode is not available in the rack mount, so you&apos;d need the<br/>plug-in versions, or stand-alone version for Mac/Win.<br/>--------------</p><p>Resolution : &quot;...the .01 cent accuracies by which the various scales of the<br/>Automatic Mode are internally specified.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Auto-Tune DSP algorithm computes the pitch to an accuracy of .0001 samples<br/>per cycle, or .0004 Hz.&quot;<br/>-------------</p><p>Compatibility:</p><p>Auto-Tune is currently available as a plugin to Steinberg&apos;s Cubase VST,<br/>MOTU&apos;s Performer, Antare&apos;s AudioStream tandalone application and the PC<br/>DirectX plugin environment.</p><p>Auto-Tune is currently available as a plugin to Digidesign&apos;s DAE/TDM system.<br/>-------------</p><p>Later,<br/>Drew</p><p>__________________________________________________<br/>Do You Yahoo!?<br/>Talk to your friends online with Yahoo!

Don&apos;t know about D.P. or L.A. but it<br/>should be essentially the same.</p><p>&gt;    If so, here are my questions:<br/>&gt; 1.  Can you specify your own tunings?</p><p>Yes!  And it has Partch built in, believe it or not.  And lots of ETs,<br/>Wells, meantones, and &quot;ethnic&quot; scales.</p><p>&gt; 2.  Can you manually specify the mapping of pitches note-by-note?</p><p>Yes.</p><p>&gt; 3.  Can you set it to intervene on pitches that are something of a<br/>&gt;     toss up (i.e., close to two different possibilities, and thus may<br/>&gt;     not be correctly mapped automatically)?</p><p>If by intervene you mean automatically judge whether or not to adjust<br/>the pitch of a note, no.  It adjusts all of the notes in a given range<br/>according to the current algorithm, or none at all.  You can, of course,<br/>adjust a few in a row, skip one or more, adjust a few more in a row,<br/>etc.  IOW, you don&apos;t have to correct a whole waveform at once.</p><p>There are actually two different modes.  The above describes the auto<br/>mode.  The graphic mode makes a graph of the pitches, after which you<br/>redraw it and it adjusts the pitches according to your drawn graph<br/>rather than according to a pitch map.  You could pitch one D up and the<br/>next one down.  It&apos;s difficult, though, to draw adjustments smaller<br/>than, say, a 1/12 tone (you&apos;re looking at about 1/3&quot; of screen per<br/>semitone).  IOW, graphic mode is great for correcting a &quot;bad&quot; pitch here<br/>and there, but maybe not so good for picky microtonal work.</p><p>&gt; 4.  They say that you can add vibrato to notes.  Does that mean<br/>&gt;     that it automatically obliterates vibrato thereby necessitating<br/>&gt;     correcting for it?</p><p>Not necessarily, though it could.  You can set it to accomodate a<br/>certain amount of vibrato using parameters called &quot;how fast&quot; and &quot;how<br/>picky&quot; or something like that.  You can have it add simple pitch<br/>modulation but that always sounds synthetic in my experience.</p><p>&gt; 5.  How natural-sounding are the results?  Not surprisingly, the<br/>&gt;     ad claims that they&apos;re nearly indistinguishible from the original<br/>&gt;     other than being in tune (to that tuning system).</p><p>It&apos;s surprisingly good -- best I&apos;ve ever heard.  It really has gotten<br/>rave reviews throughout the pro audio industry and is in very widespread<br/>use.  A picky ear listening through a high quality monitoring system<br/>will hear slight artifacts occasionally, if listening for them.  If you<br/>were to shift a pitch by more than a whole tone, I imagine the side<br/>effects would become more obvious.</p><p>If you try to correct a singer whose style is especially active in terms<br/>of scoops and fall-offs, you&apos;ll find that you have to spend a lot of<br/>time correcting pitches by hand with the graph method -- quicker to just<br/>get the performance out of the singer in the first place.  For most<br/>singers, it&apos;s a life-saver.</p><p>--<br/>David J. Finnamore<br/>Nashville, TN, USA<br/><a href="http://members.xoom.com/dfinn">http://members.xoom.com/dfinn</a><br/>--</p></div>
