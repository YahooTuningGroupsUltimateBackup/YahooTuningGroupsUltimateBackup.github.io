Who cares?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; The point is if someone is describing one perception that can be shown to<br/>differ from a<br/>&gt; different perception then we should all work together to come up with a<br/>name or way to<br/>&gt; describe the two so we can communicate well.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; On the other hand, if we are debating whether a term can apply or not to a<br/>single<br/>&gt; perception, but it isn&apos;t helping us describe the difference of the<br/>perception from other<br/>&gt; perceptions, then GIVE IT UP.  What&apos;s the point?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Put simply: if two parts are one two notes and then come to a unison, how<br/>is it perceived?<br/>&gt; I can think of a lot of possibilities:  one where we still hear them as<br/>distinct, one in which<br/>&gt; they fuse, and a whole range of a mix in between.  We can describe what<br/>factors will affect<br/>&gt; where on this line the perception results, but we can&apos;t deny that the same<br/>sounds may be<br/>&gt; perceived differently on this same line from person to person or even from<br/>moment to<br/>&gt; moment or between each time listening.  So it is useful to describe this<br/>line between<br/>&gt; fusing and distinction between two notes of a unison.  And it is useful to<br/>discuss the<br/>&gt; factors that push it one way or another.  I doubt anybody would deny the<br/>existence of this<br/>&gt; range of perception.  So how about discussing what factors lead to what<br/>perception, and<br/>&gt; then when we have an idea what we&apos;re talking about, we can apply names to<br/>things for the<br/>&gt; sake of communication.  Instead, it appears people are wrapped up in<br/>arguing about the<br/>&gt; names before they&apos;ve clarified the ideas.  We could be working together to<br/>find what we&apos;re<br/>&gt; descibing in common, and then helping each other to find the best way to<br/>communicate<br/>&gt; about it.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; -Aaron<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;</p></div><h3><a id=64921 href="#64921">ðŸ”—</a>Aaron Wolf &#x3C;backfromthesilo@yahoo.com&#x3E;</h3><span>3/2/2006 2:23:55 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;Ozan Yarman&quot; &lt;ozanyarman@...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Since when did the definition of unison entail actual acoustic conditions of<br/>&gt; pitch fluctuations, vibratos or glissandos in a real performance?

Glaring errors by any two musicians trying to sound a unison is<br/>&gt; not the fault of the unison.<br/>&gt;</p><p>That&apos;s exactly what I&apos;m saying!  Except for this: unison is a word.  If we have two different<br/>definitions, then we can figure out if we are explaining two different things.  If so, we need<br/>two different terms.  It&apos;s just for communication.  In other words, there is absolutely no<br/>reason that two people, each descibing a different idea should either one care what word<br/>is used to describe it, as long as they both end up with a way to communicate their unique<br/>ideas.  So there&apos;s no reason to argue.  Just work together to clarify meaning so we all have<br/>useful words.  If &quot;unison&quot; alone doesn&apos;t express to me what you mean, don&apos;t try to tell me<br/>that you&apos;ve changed the definition of unison, unless everyone has agreed to use that<br/>change.  Because it&apos;s all about communication, right?</p><p>I wasn&apos;t saying unison involves those performance issues, I was saying that if those are<br/>factors in our musical discussion, we need words to define the difference between<br/>perceptions based on those things and the other perceptions we&apos;re talking about.</p><p>Emotional does not equal perceptual.  And if you are claiming that words like unison or<br/>even the idea behind them even exist without perception, I have to disagree.  Unisons did<br/>not exist before people.  Unison is an idea.  Not a reality.  Well- that is unless we define<br/>unison as simply the existence of identical frequency waves coming from discreet sources<br/>at the same moment in time.  But if that&apos;s all it is, then what&apos;s with the big discussion?</p><p>-Aaron</p></div>
