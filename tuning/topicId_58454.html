It is the<br/>meantone version of 128/125 (the standard or minor diesis) and 648/625<br/>(the major diesis.)<br/>It&apos;s also the meantone version of the diaschisma, 2048/2025, and of<br/>6561/6250 which has been called a diesis also. It&apos;s also the meantone<br/>version for the reciprocals of the Pythagorean comma and the schisma,<br/>but we can ignore that, I hope.</p><p>If we go to the 7-limit we get it also as 36/35, sometimes called the<br/>septimal diesis, and 50/49, the tritonic diesis. There is also a whole<br/>raft of things called a diesis which are not 12 genetators of<br/>meantone, though sometimes they are one step of 31 equal. For instance<br/>245/243, the minor BP diesis, 525/512, the Avicenna enharmonic diesis,<br/>3125/3072, the small diesis are all -19 generators of meantone, making<br/>them the same in 31-et at least.</p><p>Hmmm...augmented unison--how&apos;s that&apos;s for a name?

Some years ago I heared this note<br/>  still distinctly. Actually - as a result of my age -<br/>  the highest audible tone for me is E with 10,560 Hz.</p><p>  In order not to fall in depressions, I decided to profit<br/>  by this shortcoming by a hear experiment.<br/>  I selected the two notes Eb (audible with 9,956 Hz)<br/>  and the G (inaudible with 12,543 Hz) and tuned<br/>  the G to 12,445 Hz so that both tones have been tuned<br/>  to a perfect major third.<br/>  Then I played alternately either only the Eb or both the<br/>  Eb and G in common. I listened whether I could hear a<br/>  change in the sound as a result of the resulting difference<br/>  tones.<br/>  At the start of the experiment I had only the impression that<br/>  the sound changed, but I was not sure. Therefore I held both<br/>  tones and tuned the upper and inaudible G gliding to one<br/>  octave deeper and then back to its original height. In this<br/>  way I could follow with my ears some occuring and<br/>  disappearing gliding  difference tones.</p><p>  After about 15 minutes my ears have been more sensible<br/>  and I was sure to hear the difference tone(s) even when<br/>  the G sounded in its original height of for me in principle<br/>  inaudible 12,445 Hz.<br/>  At the last step of my experiment a second person<br/>  behind my back played either the Eb alone or alternately both<br/>  tones Eb and G. I had to lift my hand as soon as both tones<br/>  had been &quot;on&quot; and I percieved this without any error.</p><p>  This result cannot become explained by the traditional<br/>  &quot;place theory&quot;.</p><p>  I hope that some members have a suitable equipment for<br/>  imitating this experiment. But please weight: The effect is<br/>  very subtile and the ears require about 15 minutes until<br/>  they will produce optimal results.</p></div><h3><a id=58462 href="#58462">ðŸ”—</a>Danny Wier &#x3C;dawiertx@sbcglobal.net&#x3E;</h3><span>5/4/2005 9:45:35 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>From: &quot;monz&quot; &lt;monz@...&gt;</p><p>&gt; &quot;Dave Keenan&quot; &lt;d.keenan@b...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt; --- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>,<br/>&gt;&gt; &quot;Gene Ward Smith&quot; &lt;gwsmith@s...&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt; &gt; I&apos;m wondering if &quot;meantone diesis&quot; should be the name for 12<br/>&gt;&gt; &gt; generators, or if someone has a better one to suggest.<br/>&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt; Yes.
