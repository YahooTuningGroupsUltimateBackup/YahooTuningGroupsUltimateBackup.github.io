It was on the list early in the<br/>morning...  Paul, did you write it during the night??</p><p>Anyway... it looks like the beginnings of the Erlich &quot;Gentle<br/>Introduction to CPS Scales&quot; for which we have all been waiting...</p><p>I&apos;m certain that in conjunction with the original Wilson article, I will<br/>be making some progress.  It surely is a good idea, as Kraig Grady<br/>gently suggests, to actually READ the Wilson article.  Certainly not an<br/>unreasonable request...</p><p>I was happy to find, also, that the tuning list has reached over 400<br/>recipients.  My personal bias is that more people have been attracted to<br/>it since there has been some &quot;intermediate&quot; discussion on the list of<br/>late in addition to the most advanced.  But then, as a proud<br/>intermediate, that is my slant... and it could be totally off...</p><p>Thanks again!</p><p>___________ _____ ___ __ _<br/>Joseph Pehrson</p></div>
