On the conceptual level,<br/>there is no way to &quot;mistune&quot; them.  However, using the example of unisons<br/>that are &quot;enriched&quot; to prove a preference for lack of consonance is a bit of<br/>a stretch!  In order for a set of unisons to sound even, some of them may<br/>have to be dead on, others need the three strings tuned in such a way as to<br/>create an image of clarity.  This is one difference between an aural tuning<br/>and one that is done strictly by machine.  The machine doesn&apos;t compensate for<br/>string/termination inequality and the unisons it leaves behind usually sound<br/>inconsistant.  If you want them all to sound the same, some of them are going<br/>to be mathematically different when examined.<br/>    The Weinriech effect that most tuners utilize is a way of tuning unisons<br/>so that they appear most consonant while still creating more sustain.  This<br/>is discussed in his article on the  &quot;Coupled Motion of Piano Strings&quot;.<br/>   What we do is tune the unisons so that they sound their best, and it has<br/>been found that changes in their fundamental pitch on the order of .1 cent is<br/>capable of creating a difference.  These &quot;mistuning&quot; are not heard as beats,<br/>or lack of consonance, but rather, as an increas in clarity.  Why?  Because<br/>the lack of perfection in the partials, and the interaction at the bridge of<br/>slightly out of phase signals &quot;drawing&quot; together.  This is very different<br/>from the perceived choral effect that a twelve string creates.<br/>   There are examples of pianos with unisons that are evidently beating.  The<br/>latest one is a Dr. John cut on his CD &quot;Duke Elegant&quot;, in which the last<br/>track is &quot;Flaming Sword&quot;.  The loose unisons are part of the charm and it<br/>works.  Jim Morrison and the Doors also used a piano that sounded like it had<br/>never been tuned, and they sold millions of recordings.<br/>Regards,<br/>Ed Foote<br/>Nashville, Tn.</p></div><h3><a id=17761 href="#17761">ðŸ”—</a>Afmmjr@aol.com</h3><span>1/20/2001 7:42:29 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>In a message dated 1/20/01 6:01:17 AM Eastern Standard Time, <a href="mailto:a440a@aol.com">a440a@aol.com</a><br/>writes:</p><p>&gt; Jim Morrison and the Doors also used a piano that sounded like it had<br/>&gt;  never been tuned, and they sold millions of recordings.</p><p>Among other great musicians that showed a preference would include:</p><p>Charles Ives (described in his Memos)<br/>Modest Mussorgsky (according to Shostokovitch in his Testimonial)<br/>Alban Berg (used in the last act of his opera &quot;Wozzeck&quot;)</p><p>Johnny Reinhard</p></div><h3><a id=17766 href="#17766">ðŸ”—</a>Todd Wilcox &#x3C;twilcox@patriot.net&#x3E;</h3><span>1/20/2001 9:29:20 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Ed Foote wrote:<br/>&lt;a lot of stuff about piano tuning, especially unisons&gt;</p><p>You sound like you&apos;re a piano tuner?

Am I completely wrong&gt;&gt;</p><p>Greetings,<br/>   No,  not completely wrong, but the truth is being stretched.   The<br/>Justness has to be defined by a defined partial congruence. On the piano, the<br/>wire&apos;s inharmonic values only allow perfect alignment at one partial meeting,<br/>the others will be slightly off.  This means that if an octave is Just at the<br/>2:1,  it will be slightly wide at the 4:2 or 6:3 meetings.  This is why we<br/>use different sizes of octaves at different places along the pianos span.<br/>   As one leaves the temperament octave and goes up,  it is necessary to<br/>stretch the octaves fromt their &quot;near 2:1&quot; configuration.  By the fifth<br/>octave, the width is between 2:1 and 4:2, and by the 7th octave, if the<br/>individual octaves are not near the 6:3, the double and certainly the triple<br/>octaves will sound flat.<br/>   Same goes in the bass, only you flatten the descending octaves, and the<br/>failure to do so doesn&apos;t render the bass sounding sharp so much as it makes<br/>the piano sound weak.</p><p>Also, to combine another posting under the same heading, Paul writes:<br/>&gt;&gt;the point is that you can tune JI intervals<br/>with extreme accuracy _without_ counting, and that demonstrates a<br/>significant psychoacoustical difference between JI intervals and<br/>tempered intervals. &lt;&lt;</p><p>    Hmm,  how can JI be tuned with extreme accuracy?  As two notes approach<br/>Just, there is less information to go on,  and at some point it becomes very<br/>difficult to tell if one is slightly narrow or wide.   If you attempt to tune<br/>a string of perfect fifths, the cumulative error will historically cause a<br/>bit of shift along the way.<br/>    This question is based on acoustic instruments, perhaps a synth with a<br/>numerical readout makes Just an easy target, but when you are tightening<br/>wires, embouchures, or tuning slides, things get a bit difficult to discern<br/>when the beating becomes too slow to register.<br/>Wondering,<br/>Ed Foote</p></div><h3><a id=17792 href="#17792">ðŸ”—</a>Todd Wilcox &#x3C;twilcox@patriot.net&#x3E;</h3><span>1/21/2001 12:45:10 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Ed Foote wrote:<br/>&gt; Greetings,<br/>&gt;    As one leaves the temperament octave and goes up,  it is<br/>&gt; necessary to<br/>&gt; stretch the octaves fromt their &quot;near 2:1&quot; configuration.
