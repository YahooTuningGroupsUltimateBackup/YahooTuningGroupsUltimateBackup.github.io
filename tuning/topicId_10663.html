The one with Bs unmapped is similar<br/>&gt; enough to the one with Es unmapped that I don&apos;t think it&apos;s worth exploring<br/>&gt; both. I suggest the latter as a standard since most keyboards begin and end<br/>&gt; on C, so that one gets a 2222 3 2222 3 2222 ... pattern on the black keys --<br/>&gt; easy to remember.<br/>&gt;</p><p>Thanks, Paul, for the clarification.  Hmmm. I see what you mean.  Then<br/>it&apos;s back to the &quot;drawing board&quot; for me if I want to figure out that<br/>mapping for Scala.</p><p>Incidentally, I&apos;m not particularly found of ANY scales that leave<br/>certain notes unmapped on the standard keyboard... but I realize that&apos;s<br/>very &quot;keyboard-centric&quot; for me.  HOWEVER, in my defense I would have to<br/>say that &quot;that&apos;s my pitch interface&quot; at the moment!</p><p>_____________ _____ ___ __ _<br/>Joseph Pehrson</p></div><h3><a id=10673 href="#10673">ðŸ”—</a>Paul Erlich &#x3C;PERLICH@ACADIAN-ASSET.COM&#x3E;</h3><span>6/16/2000 10:11:21 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@egroups.com">tuning@egroups.com</a>, Joseph Pehrson &lt;josephpehrson@c...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt; Thanks, Paul, for the clarification.
