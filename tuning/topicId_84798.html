How could anyone really support it? I honestly thought<br/>you were joking around when I read that in your first message. Then,<br/>as time went on, I realized you were only half-joking. Then, as more<br/>time elapsed, I realized that you weren&apos;t kidding at all. As I have no<br/>personal insight into your financial musculature, I can only assume at<br/>this point that you are somewhat serious about this whole venture, and<br/>that part of your goal with this does legitimately involve getting<br/>these bells retuned away from the current system and to LucyTuning.</p><p>I&apos;ve always held the opinion that LucyTuning is a pretty good sounding<br/>meantone. Psychoacoustically, I don&apos;t know whether it really has to do<br/>with your explanation about pi and so on, but it certainly does sound<br/>pretty good. Nonetheless, it is irresponsible to think that you can<br/>just slap it (or any meantone) on an instrument as grossly inharmonic<br/>as a carillon and just expect it to sound good. Especially if your<br/>rationale is based on a theory involving pi and such that is<br/>impossible to falsify.</p><p>You are addressing your messages to a list whose entire focus is<br/>tuning systems. There is likely a world of room for improvement in the<br/>way carillon bells are tuned. Furthermore, if there existed a group of<br/>people in the universe that are capable of actually figuring out how<br/>to do exactly that, they are likely subscribed to this list. What do<br/>you expect to hear when you tell us then that your plan is to blindly<br/>throw your proprietary meantone onto these bells? Don&apos;t you expect to<br/>hear the obvious objections of whether a meantone is even the best<br/>route to choose? &quot;Why not a well-temperament? Why not a nonoctave<br/>tuning, with the scale degrees skewed to accomodate for the<br/>inharmonicity of the bells?&quot; Come on.</p><p>If you do such a thing, and your rationale presumably involves no<br/>listening tests, you will likely be met with the protests of the<br/>people working at the company who have spent their lives getting<br/>involved with bell tuning systems, the people on this list and others,<br/>the people in all sorts of academic circles that study this sort of<br/>thing, and the people that have to listen to the out of tune bells. A<br/>motor racing company, on the other hand, will likely lack a vested<br/>interest in promoting their proprietary tuning system.</p><p>On the other hand, if it is somehow determined that a meantone is the<br/>best way to go, I say sure, go with LucyTuning. But other than just<br/>throw the bells out, there isn&apos;t much worse you can do than put all of<br/>them in the world out of tune.</p><p>-Mike</p></div><h3>martinsj013 &#x3C;martinsj@...&#x3E;</h3><span>9/21/2009 3:45:29 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, Charles Lucy &lt;lucy@...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt; I have found some Simpson references, which seem to say zero about<br/>&gt; intervals, but much about octaves:<br/>&gt; <a href="http://www.hibberts.co.uk/simpson1.htm">http://www.hibberts.co.uk/simpson1.htm</a><br/>&gt; <a href="http://www.hibberts.co.uk/simpson2.htm">http://www.hibberts.co.uk/simpson2.htm</a><br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; Frankly, I think we&apos;d all much prefer it if, whoever buys out the<br/>&gt; &gt; Taylor business, and please God someone does, simply sticks to the<br/>&gt; &gt; Taylor tradition that has given us the glorious sounds of Worcester<br/>&gt; &gt; Cathedral, Chewton Mendip, St Chad&apos;s Shrewsbury, et al and only plays<br/>&gt; &gt; with the company&apos;s structure, not its tuning methods.</p><p>Is there an element of talking at cross purposes here?

The<br/>&gt; contradictions and inexplicable nature of the current trends in<br/>&gt; bell tuning are an important part of tower ringing. I guess I am<br/>&gt; trying to say that in the case of English tower bells  changing<br/>&gt; the tuning, changes the instrument. They are no longer &grave;tower<br/>&gt; bells&apos; and a new kind of music would be needed, new ringers to<br/>&gt; ring it, and new social functions to support it.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; This in itself is an exciting idea and I know a small number of<br/>&gt; ringers who are up for the experimental approach.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; You may however want to speak with the Central Council of Church<br/>&gt; Bell Ringers (<a href="http://www.cccbr.org.uk/">http://www.cccbr.org.uk/</a>) who is the representative<br/>&gt; body for ringers and without whoose co-operation I doubt you would<br/>&gt; get anything done.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; If you were approaching a smaller less magnificent foundry I<br/>&gt; probably would not bother to say this. But the bells made by<br/>&gt; Taylors are magical instruments that the world-soul would sorely<br/>&gt; miss were they to fade.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; If you have that kind of money to spend, why not commission a<br/>&gt; set of bells and let the results speak for themselves? If the<br/>&gt; outcome is so persuasive then I am sure that the ringing community<br/>&gt; would be very happy to adopt new and culturally sensitive ideas.<br/>&gt; This has happened in the past (i.e. Simpson). You do not need to<br/>&gt; own the foundry.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; My preference would be for an international co-op of individuals<br/>&gt; to purchase Taylors. Hundreds of small stake holders. That would<br/>&gt; be wonderful.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Big vibes,<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; W<br/>&gt;</p></div>
