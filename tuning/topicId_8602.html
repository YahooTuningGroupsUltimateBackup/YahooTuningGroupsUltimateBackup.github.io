This may be so in Physics, but not in<br/>&gt; Psychoacoustics. I&apos;ve had to adjust mine many times since joining this<br/>&gt; list. Please take advantage of the generous people on this list to help you<br/>&gt; perform experiments to test your theories with accurate measurements, or<br/>&gt; accurate synthesis and good ears.</p><p>I hear ya, Bro. Believe me I don&apos;t take my notions as God&apos;s fact. On the<br/>other hand, the input I get has to relate to my own aural experience in<br/>order to be meaningful to me. My &quot;arguments&quot; are intended (I hope) as a<br/>quest for clarification.</p><p>You are absolutely right on the money about the generous people on this<br/>list. The time folks have taken (on and off List) to get me straightened out<br/>on the jargon and the math is simply incredible. I&apos;m very grateful. And,<br/>like Joe, my life will never be the same. :-)</p><p>Thanks and be well,</p><p>Jerry</p></div>
