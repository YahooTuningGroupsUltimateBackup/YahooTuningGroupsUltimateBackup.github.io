When you get to<br/>&gt; write it up including the wide/narrow extension, please email it to me,<br/>&gt; or<br/>&gt; its URL. Could you post your schismic? letter # b / \ notation for<br/>&gt; 22-tET<br/>&gt; alongside your Fokker-plus interval names.</p><p>Ah, 22-equal is what I&apos;m calling a diaschismic scale.  As such, it<br/>requires a different notation to either meantone or schismic.  On my page</p><p><a href="http://www.microtonal.co.uk/diaschis.htm">http://www.microtonal.co.uk/diaschis.htm</a></p><p>I suggest two different 12-note scales relative to which notes can be<br/>defined.  The first is keyboard-oriented:</p><p>C  C# D  Eb E  F  F# G  GA A  Bb B  C<br/>  s  s  s  s  r  s  s  s  s  s  s  r</p><p>In 22=, s=2 and r=1.  For more generality, see the website.  With this<br/>scale, fifths are perfect iff they are between two notes of the same<br/>colour.  The alternative scale has two spirals of 6 fifths, with wolves at<br/>D-A and G#-Eb</p><p>C  C# D  Eb E  F  F# G  G# A  Bb B  C<br/>  s  s  r  s  s  s  s  s  r  s  s  s</p><p>The former scale is easier to remember if you&apos;ve been indoctrinated into<br/>the hegemony of the Halberstadt keyboard.  The latter is more &quot;logical&quot;<br/>and has a higher degree of symmetry, as well as having wolves in the same<br/>places as my core meantone and schismic scales.  It also means the C, F<br/>and G chords can be played on the unmodified white keys.  I think I prefer<br/>the former, but the proof will come if and when somebody writes a body of<br/>music using either.</p><p>So, having explained that I can give the scale.</p><p>But no, instead I&apos;ll define the intervals in terms of s and r.</p><p>11 tritone             7:5,10:7    5s+r<br/>10 wide fourth          11:8       5s<br/> 9 perfect fourth        4:3       4s+r<br/> 8 wide major third      9:7       4s<br/> 7 narrow major third    5:4       3s+r<br/> 6 wide minor third      6:5       3s<br/> 5 narrow minor third    7:6       2s+r<br/> 4 wide major second     9:8       2s<br/> 3 narrow major second  10:9        s+r<br/> 2 wide minor second    16:15       s<br/> 1 narrow minor second  25:24       r<br/> 0 unison                1:1        -</p><p>Which makes the following table easier to construct</p><p>#from22                          keyboard        diatonic</p><p>11      tritone         5s+r     F#     Eb       F#    Eb<br/>10      wide fourth     5s       F/     D/       F/    D<br/> 9      narr fourth     4s+r     F      D        F     D\<br/> 8      wide maj third  4s       E      C#/      E/    C#<br/> 7      narr maj third  3s+r     E\     C#       E     C#\<br/> 6      wide min third  3s       Eb     C/       Eb/   C<br/> 5      narr min third  2s+r     Eb\    C        Eb    C\<br/> 4      wide maj second 2s       D      B        D     B<br/> 3      narr maj second s+r      D\     B\       D\    B\<br/> 2      wide min second s        C#     Bb       C#    Bb<br/> 1      narr min second r        C#\    Bb\      C#\   Bb\<br/> 0      unison          -        C      A        C     A</p><p>The &quot;keyboard&quot; columns are for the keyboard-oriented base scale and the<br/>&quot;diatonic&quot; columns are for the other one.  This table is generally valid<br/>for all diaschismic scales.</p><p>Now, here&apos;s where it gets complicated.  The &quot;normal&quot; range of diaschismic<br/>scales covers two different 7-limit mappings.  The mapping of ratios to<br/>names given in the first table is consistent with neither of these, and so<br/>unique to 22=.</p><p>(Note that it is not, therefore, generally true that a diaschismic scale<br/>will have an exact half-octave equal to 7:5 and 10:7.  Somebody stated<br/>this on the list way back.  There will always be a half-octave, but only<br/>in 22= does it approximate anything useful.)</p><p>That means we need another table:</p><p>22  46   ratio   46-34     34-22    22</p><p>11  22    7:5    5s+2r     6s-r    5s+r<br/> 9  19    4:3    4s+r      4s+r    4s+r<br/> 8  17    9:7    5s-r      3s+2r   4s<br/> 7  15    5:4    3s+r      3s+r    3s+r<br/> 6  12    6:5    3s        3s      3s<br/> 5  10    7:6    s+2r      3s-r    2s+r<br/> 4   9    8:7    3s-r       s+2r   2s<br/> 4   8    9:8    2s        2s      2s<br/> 3   7   10:9     s+r       s+r     s+r<br/> 2   4   16:15    s         s       s<br/> 1   3   25:24    r         r       r<br/> 0   0    1:1     -         -       -</p><p>From that, I guess you can define the super/sub interval as r for 22=,<br/>whereas the wide/narrow interval is s-r.  So 3s-r is the subminor third<br/>and 2s+r is the narrow minor third.  As they&apos;re both 5 steps, you could<br/>call them both 7/6.  I think that makes the interval C-D/ a subminor<br/>third, but it&apos;s getting late so I wouldn&apos;t guarantee it.  Similarly, the<br/>supermajor second will be C-Eb\ or C-Eb\\ depending on the base scale.</p><p>Oh boy.  And for scales like 46=, the super/sub interval will be 2(s-r)<br/>which is written as // or \\.  That&apos;s that same as the schismic super/sub.<br/> How convenient.</p><p>Only two more things before I go to bed.</p><p>Although I use the word &quot;diaschismic&quot; for this scale class, I don&apos;t like<br/>it.  Too many syllables, doesn&apos;t seem to mean anything.  If such scales<br/>were ever too catch on, I&apos;d want to find a new name.</p><p>How come it&apos;s &quot;Paul E.&quot;, &quot;Jerry E.&quot; and &quot;Graham Breed&quot;?
