Specifically, the idea of neo-Gothic<br/>temperaments with fifths wider than pure is indeed a _neo_-Gothic<br/>concept, not an element of medieval theory, which is based on<br/>Pythagorean or 3-limit just intonation.</p><p>As Paul points out, medieval Pythagorean systems do extend the gamut<br/>to up to 17 notes per octave, but this is different from 17-tone equal<br/>temperament (17-tet), which combines accentuated versions of some<br/>standard Pythagorean intervals (e.g. the wide major third and narrow<br/>minor third) with other intervals quite different from those of known<br/>medieval practice (e.g. the neutral thirds and sixths).</p><p>In discussing the medieval references to intervals such as<br/>thirdtones, quartertones, or &quot;fifth parts of a tone&quot; which do occur<br/>now and then, I feel it important to add that these are typically<br/>hints to singers, not guides to keyboard tunings or to a systematic<br/>definition of the various intervals of polyphonic music.</p><p>Also, especially through Boethius, medieval theorists might be aware<br/>of the enharmonic genus of Greek theory with its dieses equal to half<br/>of a semitone. Thus after endorsing the idea of a 17-note Pythagorean<br/>keyboard (with five flats and five sharps) for the &quot;intelligent<br/>organist,&quot; Ugolino of Orvieto around 1435 or so suggests that an extra<br/>two keys might be added dividing the semitones E-F and B-C into equal<br/>parts in the ancient Greek manner, but notes that this is not used in<br/>current music. It seems more of an &quot;antiquarian&quot; touch, so to speak.</p><p>In short, I would like to emphasize that either Pythagorean systems<br/>with more than 17-notes per octave (e.g. Xeno-Gothic with 24), or<br/>temperaments with fifths wider than pure, are 20th-century variations<br/>on Gothic music and its system of Pythagorean just tuning with up to<br/>17 notes per octave.</p><p>Also, the Xeno-Gothic system has a certain medievalist humor to it. In<br/>the early 14th century, Marchettus of Padua was going outside the<br/>bounds of Pythagorean mathematics by proposing a division of the<br/>whole-tone into &quot;five parts&quot; -- especially if we take this as a<br/>geometric division into equal ratios, as did such critics as<br/>Prosdocimus about a century later.</p><p>The Xeno-Gothic tuning provides one _possible_ realization for the<br/>cadences of Marchettus based on a 20th-century application of<br/>Pythagorean mathematics: make cadential major thirds or sixths<br/>precisely a Pythagorean comma wider than their usual forms. In a<br/>typical three-voice cadence combining M6-8 and M3-5, this produces an<br/>unstable sonority very close to 7:9:12 expanding to a 2:3:4 trine, and<br/>diatonic semitones (or thirdtones) a bit larger than 28:27. Using C4<br/>as middle C, and &quot;^&quot; to show a note raised by a Pythagorean comma, for<br/>example:</p><p>E^4 F4<br/>B^3 C4<br/>G3  F3</p><p>In certain timbres, at least, this &quot;solution&quot; sound very &quot;right&quot; to<br/>me, but the basic interpretation of the statements by Marchettus about<br/>cadential intonation remain a matter for debate, let alone any<br/>specific choice of interval sizes.</p><p>Most appreciatively,</p><p>Margo Schulter<br/><a href="mailto:mschulter@value.net">mschulter@value.net</a></p></div>
