The feature film, entitled NAMIBIA: THE STRUGGLE FOR LIBERATION, starring Danny Glover and Carl Lumbly, is an epic tale that unfolds during Namibia&apos;s 50 year struggle for independence.  It&apos;s musical score represents the most ambitious undertaking of my career as it employed approximately 300 musicians (2/3rds of whom were Namibian) and was recorded on 3 continents.  It blends tribal field recordings I made there in Africa with a 94 piece European orchestra and lots of indigenous instruments including some primitive one&apos;s I made by hand from found objects.  Though the<br/>rank and file citizens of Nambia will love this picture, there is<br/>currently a lot of controversy within the Namibian government about this<br/>film (even though they funded it) and we still don&apos;t know if this will<br/>be the very first or very last screening of the movie.  In any event I<br/>hope you can make it and would love to know what you think of it.<br/>Thanks Much,<br/>Stephen James Taylor</p><p>Tickets can be purchased online or by calling 1-866-345-6337.
