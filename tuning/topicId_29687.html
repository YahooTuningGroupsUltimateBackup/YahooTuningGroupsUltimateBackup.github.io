Free Spirits<br/>in Tokyo (with the inimitable Dennis Chambers on drums) and After the<br/>Rain, a tribute to the John Coltrane Quartet (with former quartet<br/>member, the inimitable Elvin Jones on drums).</p><p>Players who are pushing the Hammond sound into the freshest<br/>territory are downtowners John Medeski and Jamie Saft. There is a &quot;best<br/>of&quot; CD of Medeski Martin and Wood that has some great stuff, though<br/>&quot;Shakman&quot; and &quot;Its a Jungle in Here&quot; are worth having in their complete<br/>versions. MMW are extremely popular these days, but that shouldn&apos;t<br/>be jheld against them, they do some great music.</p><p>The only Jamie Saft I have is on a CD called Mr Lucky. It has the<br/>inimitable Dave Tronzo on slide guitar to add some manic microtones.<br/>McLaughlin also has a bending style, perhaps the 335-like guitar<br/>he uses has a scalloped fretboard, that is &quot;expressively&quot; microtonal.</p><p>Love that Hammond sound!</p><p>Bob Valentine</p></div><h3><a id=29689 href="#29689">ðŸ”—</a>John A. deLaubenfels &#x3C;jdl@adaptune.com&#x3E;</h3><span>10/28/2001 6:06:32 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>[I wrote:]<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt; Not sure I&apos;ve ever heard one!<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt; Any sources for recordings?</p><p>[Paul E:]<br/>&gt;&gt;Anything with Jimmy Smith on it (including two fine albums with Wes<br/>&gt;&gt;Montgomery), or Joey deFrancesco (a great Jimmy Bruno album and a<br/>&gt;&gt;great John McLaughlin album come to mind), or the many other Hammond<br/>&gt;&gt;virtuosos out there (as you can see I&apos;m more focused on guitarists).</p><p>[Bob Valentine:]<br/>&gt;Joey deFrancesco did two wonderful CDs with McLaughlin.

I poked around on <a href="http://amazon.com">amazon.com</a> and found<br/>some audio samples.  Not high quality, of course, but one thing that was<br/>clear was... I don&apos;t like the music!  I&apos;ve always, unfortunately, been<br/>&quot;jazz deficient&quot; for much of the genre; it just doesn&apos;t speak to me,<br/>somehow.</p><p>On the other hand, I&apos;m very interested in trying to dig a little deeper<br/>into the Hammond organ.  When it came up before, in the midst of a<br/>heated debate over the proper meaning of &quot;JI&quot;, I missed the paise for<br/>its sound that I&apos;m now hearing.  Famous musicians use it to produce<br/>music much revered by well-informed listeners.  With so many choices of<br/>keyboards available, the use of the Hammond would seem to mean one (or<br/>both) of two things:</p><p>   . There&apos;s something about its ease of playing, notes with a nice<br/>     degree of attack, built-in effects, or other characteristics not<br/>     directly related to tuning.</p><p>   . There&apos;s something about its (quasi) 12-tET overtones.</p><p>Could it be the latter?  If so, that&apos;s a foreshadowing of Bill Sethares&apos;<br/>work that we&apos;ve heard most recently in his 19-tET piece (I should not<br/>fail to add Margo Schulter&apos;s name as well, on recent pieces which so<br/>far, unfortunately, are not available for listening).  And it would seem<br/>to reinforce the notion that tinkering with the precise tunings of<br/>partials might be a powerful and effective tool for mictotonal<br/>composition.</p><p>I&apos;d relly _love_ to hear a MIDI sound set with all the voices altered<br/>to have partials aligned with 12-tET, then listen to 12-tET sequences in<br/>those voices.  It&apos;d be lots of fun to compare that to my own adaptive<br/>tunings with harmonic voices.  Maybe I&apos;d get beat up bad!</p><p>JdL</p></div><h3><a id=29693 href="#29693">ðŸ”—</a>Paul Erlich &#x3C;paul@stretch-music.com&#x3E;</h3><span>10/28/2001 1:16:33 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In tuning@y..., Robert C Valentine &lt;BVAL@I...&gt; wrote:</p><p>&gt; Players who are pushing the Hammond sound into the freshest<br/>&gt; territory are downtowners John Medeski and Jamie Saft.</p><p>I&apos;ve seen Medeski a few times and have a few of his CDs . . . I&apos;ll have to check out Jamie Saft.</p><p>If your tastes run more towards progressive rock than jazz, check out Tony Kaye&apos;s subtle<br/>Hammond work (as well as nice acoustic piano) on _The Yes Album_ by Yes (1971). After this<br/>album, they fired Tony and got into synths . . . not sure how I feel about that. Of course, at the<br/>time, Keith Emerson (of Emerson, Lake, and Palmer -- eponymous first album was nice) was<br/>the Jimi Hendrix of the Hammond organ, playing Bach, Copland, and Ginastera on it from<br/>behind and then smashing it to bits . . .</p><p>Oh, and of course everyone&apos;s heard Billy Preston&apos;s Hammond on the Beatles &quot;Let it Be&quot;!</p><p>The Hammond organ came on up this list a while back, in the great &quot;definition of JI&quot; debate,<br/>because while its tones (and overtones) are within 1 cent of 12-tET, they&apos;re actually RI (rational<br/>intonation)! All the notes are actually produced by tonewheels connected to a central 320Hz<br/>gear, and the gear ratios are all fractions of two-digit numbers -- hence it&apos;s very much like various<br/>systems that some people consider to be JI. I had to conclude that under such a definition of JI,<br/>_anything_ can be considered JI.</p></div><h3><a id=29696 href="#29696">ðŸ”—</a>jpehrson@rcn.com</h3><span>10/28/2001 3:31:31 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In tuning@y..., Robert C Valentine &lt;BVAL@I...&gt; wrote:</p><p><a href="/tuning/topicId_29687.html#29687">/tuning/topicId_29687.html#29687</a></p><p>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; Not sure I&apos;ve ever heard one!<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; Are you quite serious?<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; Any sources for recordings?<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; Anything with Jimmy Smith on it (including two fine albums with<br/>Wes<br/>&gt; &gt; Montgomery), or Joey deFrancesco (a great Jimmy Bruno album and a<br/>&gt; &gt; great John McLaughlin album come to mind), or the many other<br/>Hammond<br/>&gt; &gt; virtuosos out there (as you can see I&apos;m more focused on<br/>guitarists).<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt;</p><p>Is the Hammond with Leslie speakers what Miles Davis uses in &quot;In a<br/>Silent Way...&quot; or am I getting confused...??</p><p>_________ _________ ______<br/>Joseph Pehrson</p></div><h3><a id=29720 href="#29720">ðŸ”—</a>Paul Erlich &#x3C;paul@stretch-music.com&#x3E;</h3><span>10/29/2001 11:12:10 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In tuning@y..., jpehrson@r... wrote:</p><p>&gt; Is the Hammond with Leslie speakers what Miles Davis uses in &quot;In a<br/>&gt; Silent Way...&quot; or am I getting confused...??</p><p>I know there&apos;s a Rhodes electric piano on there . . .

Some larger Hammond models had a single fifth harmonic stop, but it&apos;s rarely used by players anyway (probably because the non-harmonic detuning is considered unpleasant).</p><p>What does matter though, is the fact that the timbre consists of only octaves and fifths-which are not out of tune with 12tet, whether they are 2 cents flat or not.
