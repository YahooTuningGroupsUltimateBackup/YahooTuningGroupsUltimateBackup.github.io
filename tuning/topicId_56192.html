The Doctor<br/>travels about the universe in this spaceship and<br/>it si supposed to change form to camouflage with<br/>its surroundings but has got stuck in this form and<br/>always appears like a police telephone box wherever<br/>he goes. Anyway it is an analogy sometimes used<br/>here in the UK to mean something that seems<br/>much larger than you would think from the ouside.</p><p>So it is great to know about it, and I enjoyed reading<br/>the review.</p><p>I was particularly interested to see how it might<br/>help to improve the program, so was interested<br/>to read the negative parts of the review. The two main things<br/>he mentions - the toy like impression you get from the skin,<br/>and the complexity of the program I hope are addressed to<br/>some extend in the new version 3.0 when it is ready<br/>- for the complexity I have done quite a few things<br/>and one of them is to add More buttons to many of the windows<br/>letting one have a simpler appearance first time around and more<br/>complexity with plenty of things to tweak if one wants it.<br/>Though that makes it even more Tardis like :-).</p><p>I was surprised how long it was. Encouraging to read<br/>and encouraging for completing the long work to finish off<br/>FTS 3.0 which I hope will be ready fairly soon now.</p><p>Thanks!</p><p>Robert</p></div>
