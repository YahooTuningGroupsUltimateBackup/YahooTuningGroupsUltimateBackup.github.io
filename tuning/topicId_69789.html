There are two accurate ways to use<br/>171 in the 11-limit:</p><p>U = &lt;171 271 397 480 592|</p><p>V = &lt;171 271 397 480 591|</p><p>&quot;U&quot; tempers out what I&apos;ve called the 243/242-441/440-540/539 complex.<br/>The factorization of 243/242 involves only 2, 3, and 11, and defines<br/>11/9 as the 11-limit neutral third--that is, (3/2)/(11/9)^2 =<br/>243/242. We then have that (11/9)/(49/40) = 441/440, and (60/49)/<br/>(11/9) = 540/539. So the 11-limit planar temperament {243/242,<br/>2401/2400} is supported by this version of 171edo.</p><p>&quot;V&quot; tempers out 385/384 instead, which is a very useful thing indeed;<br/>it equates 48/35, which is across a diagonal of the hexany from 1/1,<br/>with 11/8: (11/8)/(48/35) = 385/384. This gives you an amazingly<br/>efficent and accurate means of squeezing 11-limit harmony into the 7-<br/>limit lattice, and if you want a tuning for it which puts most of the<br/>error burden on the 11-limit but allows some to fall on the 7-limit,<br/>it&apos;s self-recommending. I&apos;m thinking about exploring such things as<br/>the convex closure of the eikosany in 385/384-spacial.</p><p>For 441/440, the patent val is most accurate, and it tempers out<br/>4000/3993. If you add 2401/2400 and 4375/4374 to that, you get an<br/>extension of ennealimmal which slices the 36/35 ennealimmal generator<br/>into thirds, which is not nearly as efficent as slicing the period in<br/>half, which is what hemiennealimmal does. But that might not matter<br/>to you, if what you are after is having three 11/10 small seconds<br/>come to a fourth: (4/3)/(11/10)^3 = 4000/3993.</p></div>
