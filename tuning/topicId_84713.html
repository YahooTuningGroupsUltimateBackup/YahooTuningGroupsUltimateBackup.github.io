It shows every note, and the tempo display gives me different readings for each bar to show my timing errors.

Perhaps it might be useful for astronauts in micro gravity... they could use little pop out arms to spin themselves around and thus tune their position in the space craft..</p><p>Micro-tonality is only for the fringes of musical lamp shades anyway....</p><p>....HAHAHA !! Sorry Charles just joshing with you !!.

Also Reason, Absynth, CuBase etc. etc. have begun to understand and provide microtonal capability.<br/>Since you already have the code etc. in other versions of Melodyne for user defined pitch correction, it must be possible to add a subroutine onto the DNA beta to get the pitch snap to go to user defined pitches as well as an old ubiquitous 20th century tuning system like 12edo.<br/>Obviously it would be possible to repitch each individual note to the nearest cent or 1/10th cent, as the beta is at present, but having the tuning table capability makes microtuning a &quot;simple snap&quot;, and saves hours of tedious work for those thousands of users who are nowadays microtuning their creations. Those thousands are also increasing day by day, as more musicians appreciate and exploit the advantages of microtuning.</p><p>Top&#x9;</p><p>JamesSanger&#x9;<br/> Post subject: Re: (sl) Microtuning tables access seems to be missing in betaPosted: Fri Sep 18, 2009 1:23 pm</p><p>Posts: 5</p><p>Melodyne studio&#x9;<br/>I can&apos;t believe that it wont have micro-tonality .... that is essential. It cant be hard to program it in either.... I am always using user defined scaling systems and having to use 12 ET would mean I couldn&apos;t use it... I mean even Logic&apos;s pitch correction does micro-tonal tuning !</p><p>Please put this in Stefan as soon as possible !!</p><p>Cheers,</p><p>James</p><p>&gt;</p><p>Charles Lucy<br/>lucy@...</p><p>- Promoting global harmony through LucyTuning -</p><p>for information on LucyTuning go to:<br/><a href="http://www.lucytune.com">http://www.lucytune.com</a></p><p>For LucyTuned Lullabies go to:<br/><a href="http://www.lullabies.co.uk">http://www.lullabies.co.uk</a></p></div>
