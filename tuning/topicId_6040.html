In the key of D minor, I<br/>believe that A7b9b13 is taken from the following scale (the altered scale):</p><p>        A     Bb      B      C#    Eb    (E)    F      G      A<br/>        1/1   17/16   19/16  5/4   11/8  3/2   13/16   7/8    2/1</p><p>And that #9 (B) and b5 (Eb) for that chord would also come from that same scale.</p><p>I included E and put it in parentheses because although it is not<br/>considered part of the altered scale, it could be used as an alternative<br/>for Eb. Note that in my previous post I mistakenly put a &quot;5&quot; rather than a<br/>&quot;3&quot; under the &quot;E&quot;.</p><p>Such a dominant 7th chord is loaded with tension waiting to be released (by<br/>the D minor triad to follow). It is not a pretty chord.</p><p>John Link<br/>ALMOST ACAPPELLA</p><p>&gt;From: Robert C Valentine &lt;<a href="mailto:bval@iil.intel.com">bval@iil.intel.com</a>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;I would think that singers would tune the chord to<br/>&gt;be both simple harmonically and to reflect the target.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;shown as<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;   relative interval within A7 chord<br/>&gt;note name<br/>&gt;absolute interval from D minor<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;I would expect<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;  5/4  6/5  32/27   6/5    3/2<br/>&gt;A    C#    E     G      Bb      F<br/>&gt;3/2  15/8  9/8   4/3    8/5     6/5<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;or<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;  5/4  6/5   6/5   32/27   3/2<br/>&gt;A    C#    E     G      Bb      F<br/>&gt;3/2  15/8  9/8   27/20  8/5     6/5<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;One could think about<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;  5/4  6/5   7/6   32/27   3/2<br/>&gt;A    C#    E     G      Bb      F<br/>&gt;3/2  15/8  9/8   21/16    14/9    7/6<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;but I doubt anyone would not feel that the G was flat, and<br/>&gt;having the F &apos;move up&apos; to the F in the target would sound<br/>&gt;intriqueing as well.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;BUT... it depends on the voicing. Shown &quot;straight up&quot;,<br/>&gt;I think the fifth Bb-F will be tuned. But in other<br/>&gt;voicings, the tuning of the diminshed seventh chord<br/>&gt;may dominate.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;Bob Valentine</p></div><h3><a id=6075 href="#6075">ðŸ”—</a>Xavier J.-P.
