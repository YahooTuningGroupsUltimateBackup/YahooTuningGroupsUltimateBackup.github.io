I seldom read this list these days--most of the time I follow the various<br/>tuning groups on Facebook.. I&apos;m still at UCSD, though only part-time these days, doing astrobiology/exobiology, origin of life chemistry, etc.</p><p>--John</p></div><h3>cflliu@...</h3><span>2/18/2016 4:00:42 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Hello John,</p><p> Glad to know you are around. Occasionally I read these messages but cannot find your name for a long time.</p><p> I still remember your talk about poisonous mushrooms (?). Time flies so fast.<br/> I have a boy, he now is five years old.</p><p> I strive to be able to pick up a violin any time and play in tune. But double stop is just so difficult.</p><p> God bless,<br/> Linus</p></div>
