The source is given as Hoyle<br/>Carpenter, _Microtones in a Sixteenth Century Portuguese Manuscript_<br/>(Glassboro, New Jersey).</p><p>Comparing this music with the published pieces of Nicola Vicentino and<br/>Anthoine de Bertrand could be very interesting.</p><p>Specifically, the Tuning List article refers to &quot;microtonal<br/>dissonances,&quot; and I&apos;d be curious whether this means vertical intervals<br/>altered by a diesis of roughly 1/5-tone, for example. Might this be a<br/>matter of interpretation, with a possibility for performers to add<br/>unwritten inflections to other parts in order to arrive at usual<br/>vertical concords in at least some cases?</p><p>This kind of situation arises in the single known enharmonic chanson<br/>of Bertrand, where the diesis inflections are marked for only some of<br/>the voices, but might be supplied for others (an adjustment analogous<br/>to the use of unwritten accidentals to avoid some augmented or<br/>diminished intervals, although by no means all, in more conventional<br/>16th-century styles).</p><p>Also, I would be very curious about the compass of the pieces. As I<br/>have discussed in recent posts, the pieces of Vicentino and Bertrand<br/>can each fit within a 24-note meantone tuning (or 24-out-of-31-tet, if<br/>one prefers), although different pieces use different 24-note gamuts.</p><p>Any information or assistance would be much appreciated.</p><p>Most respectfully,</p><p>Margo Schulter<br/><a href="mailto:mschulter@value.net">mschulter@value.net</a></p></div><h3>Afmmjr@xxx.xxx</h3><span>10/30/1999 8:26:26 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Margo, please send me a postal address and I&apos;ll send he monograph on<br/>Portuguese Anonymous.</p><p>Johnny Reinhard<br/>AFMM<br/><a href="mailto:afmmjr@aol.com">afmmjr@aol.com</a></p></div>
