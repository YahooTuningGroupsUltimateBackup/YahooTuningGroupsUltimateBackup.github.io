And all of the temperaments listed basically just involve the<br/>concept of merging each semitone with 17/16.</p><p>After typing this I realize that I left out 16/15 in the original<br/>example. Merging 17/16 and 16/15 would yield 256/255 as the comma<br/>being tempered out.</p><p>I worded it poorly, but I suppose all I&apos;m trying to figure out is what<br/>the set of different common commas is for 3.5.17 limit temperaments of<br/>whatever rank would be. Something analogous to 64/63 for 3.5.7 limit<br/>stuff - that shows up as the difference between the septimal and<br/>pythagorean tunings of the same generic interval (7/4 vs 16/9 for<br/>example), and then 36/35 shows up as the difference between the<br/>septimal and 5-limit tunings of the same generic interval (7/4 vs 9/5<br/>for example). Furthermore, 36/35 is actually made up of 64/63 * 81/80.</p><p>So I&apos;m trying to figure out what an analogous 17-limit construct might<br/>be - some &quot;generic&quot; 17-limit comma that appears often, and which can<br/>be combined with 81/80 to yield some &quot;generic&quot; 17-limit diesis that<br/>also appears often, and etc.</p><p>Or even simpler, there are 4 commas here being tempered out:<br/>256/255<br/>51/50<br/>136/135<br/>432/425</p><p>The four of them I think are based on one &quot;fundamental&quot; 17 limit comma<br/>with the rest resulting from tacking on 81/80&apos;s and 128/125&apos;s, and I&apos;m<br/>trying to figure out what that is.
