He has a movable<br/>&gt; fret classical guitar and knows of luthier (in France I think) that can<br/>&gt; convert guitars.  It is a system where each fretlet slides along a channel<br/>&gt; that runs the entire length of the fretboard, allowing for very flexable,<br/>&gt; precise tunings.  I have some info in print on this system and there are<br/>&gt; patents with drawings available in the US patent office archives.  Don&apos;t<br/>&gt; have time to dig it up, so let me know if you are interested.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Wim: <a href="mailto:wim.hoogewerf@fnac.net">wim.hoogewerf@fnac.net</a><br/>&gt;</p></div>
