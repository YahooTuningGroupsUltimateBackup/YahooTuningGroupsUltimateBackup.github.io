(and S will have his own S&apos; and so on...)</p><p>Another cool recurrent property that applies to each single series is :<br/>(2 times 44) - 81 = 7 also, etc.  - this is the coherence of the neutral<br/>second complementary interval which I call Scylla, itself fractal.</p><p>More complex than Phi. But great sound !</p><p>Anything to say about the octave divisions applications of Tribonacci ? were<br/>they used by any of you, or others ?</p><p>- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -<br/>Jacques</p></div><h3><a id=84817 href="#84817">ðŸ”—</a>whistlingelk &#x3C;whistlingelk@...&#x3E;</h3><span>9/21/2009 8:40:07 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>It seems you&apos;ve started delving into polynacci ratios.<br/>You all should know the 2-nacci or Fibonacci ratio is PHI.<br/>The ratio is actually the limit of n of the 2-nacci sequence: Xn/Xn-1.<br/>Phi is ((5)^(1/2)+1)/2 = 1.6180339887498948482045868343656</p><p>Now, the traditional way to look at it is the first two numbers are INTEGERS and are 1,1. In actuality, I&apos;ve created proofs showing that the first two numbers can be ANY number including ZERO and imaginary numbers and they limit to +/- infinity is always PHI.</p><p>So, you&apos;ve actually just taken it one step further to 3-nacci or Tribonacci.<br/>The ratio is again Xn/Xn-1, but the starting numbers are traditionally 1,1,1. Your &quot;F series&quot; is actually 0,1,1. Your &quot;P series&quot; is actually 2,1,1. Your &quot;S series&quot; is actually 0,1,0.</p><p>The limit of the Tribonacci sequence is 1.839286755214~.<br/>Now, I&apos;ve found limits of 2-nacci to 10-nacci.<br/>The limit of n-nacci as n approaches +/- infinity is 2!</p><p>If you have any questions about musical applications please ask me!</p><p>I recently mentioned this in another thread if you search &quot;PHITAVE&quot; but you can create a scale based on the limit of TRIB.</p><p>A tribtave scale consists of the ratio TRIB:1, 1055~ cents.<br/>With the regular twelve steps the equal-tempered intervals would be 87.9~ cents.</p></div>
