I know even light packages to<br/>Germany cost me close to $10, and there&apos;s no guarantee regarding<br/>handling.</p><p>There must be a way, though... since so many fragile items, china, etc.<br/>are imported to the US from Europe.  Maybe they go by ship?? I have no<br/>idea about any of this, but there has to be a way to get the TX81Z to<br/>RESPONSIBLE people on the list who could be using it.
