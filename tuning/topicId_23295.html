My mailer frequently dies when I try to look at HTML mail, so I<br/>usually make sure I have saved everything before clicking-and-praying on<br/>HTML messages.  They usually then cause my mail reader to die (or hang up<br/>and I have to kill it).  I can read Robert Greco&apos;s messages so far, but I<br/>sure wish he (and anyone else) didn&apos;t use HTML mail, and I&apos;m assuming that<br/>one of these days I&apos;ll get unlucky and one of R. G.&apos;s messages will kill my<br/>mailer...<br/>&#x9;Rick</p></div>
