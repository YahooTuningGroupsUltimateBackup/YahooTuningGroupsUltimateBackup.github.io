It&apos;s the hyper-meantone<br/>analog to the golden fifth. To find the golden fifth on the Stern-Brocot<br/>tree you start at 4/7, then go to 7/12, then alternate directions yielding<br/>4/7,7/12,11/19,18/31,29/50,47/81,76/131...; to find the fifth I am talking<br/>about you start at 3/5 and do the same for<br/>3/5,7/12,10/17,17/29,27/46,44/75,71/121... (The denominators of these are<br/>obviously MOS.). The actual value of the golden fifth is 2 ^ ( (4 + 3 *<br/>(phi) ) / (7 + 5 * (phi) ) ), while the actual value of my fifth is 2 ^ ( (3<br/>+ 4 * (phi) ) / (5 + 7 * (phi) ) ); all the rational and phi-related<br/>coefficients are swapped (The fourths, which some people prefer for good<br/>reason, are 2 ^ ( (3 + 2 * (phi) ) / (7 + 5 * (phi) ) ) and 2 ^ ( (3 + 2 *<br/>(phi) ) / (7 + 5 * (phi) ) ).). If it doesn&apos;t have a name yet, it should<br/>obviously be called the silver fifth.</p><p>Keenan P.</p></div><h3><a id=12599 href="#12599">ðŸ”—</a>Graham Breed &#x3C;graham@microtonal.co.uk&#x3E;</h3><span>9/10/2000 1:23:33 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>On Sun, 10 Sep 2000, Keenan Pepper wrote:</p><p>&gt; Is there a name for the noble hypermeantone fifth that makes the chromatic<br/>&gt; semitone phi times wider than the diatonic semitone?

You set the ratio of the octave to the fourth to be the<br/>same as that of the fourth to the major tone.  This gives the scale exact self<br/>symmetry.  If you take 29 notes from the spiral of fifths, then the fourth of<br/>that scale looks like the octave of a 12-note fifth-generated scale.</p><p>In the golden meantone, the ratio of a minor third to a tone is the same as<br/>that of a tone to a diatonic semitone, diatonic to chromatic semitone, etc.<br/>However, I the scale does not show self symmetry in the same way that the<br/>one described above does.</p><p>So, it happens that the perfect fourth is sqrt(2)-1 oct or 497.1 cents.  The<br/>perfect fifth is 2-sqrt(2) oct or 702.9 cents.</p><p>I don&apos;t think these intervals have any musical significance.
