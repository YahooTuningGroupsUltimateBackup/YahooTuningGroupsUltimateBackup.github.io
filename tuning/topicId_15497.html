Also, I&apos;ve heard nothing but praise for the Scelsi, and<br/>I regret missing that, too.</p><p>As far as what I did see, Pete Rose&apos;s recorder playing was both refreshing<br/>and impressive.  Marc Jones&apos; _Mostly Electric String Quartet_ was very<br/>interesting, but lost something due to the fact that only one voice was<br/>performed live (the rest supplied from tape).  The highlight of the first<br/>half for me was Erlich and Sarkissian&apos;s segment -- especially their third<br/>piece.</p><p>Likewise, a long dinner kept me out of Lou Harrison&apos;s _Sinfony in Free<br/>Style_, which I had been looking forward to (damn!), and also Judith<br/>Conrad&apos;s performance of the _Chromatic Fantasy &amp; Fugue in Dmin_.  What I<br/>did see in the second half waxed a bit long, IMO, but Wim&apos;s premiere of<br/>Joseph Pehrson&apos;s _Just in Time_ was cute, and Reinhard &amp; Pierce&apos;s<br/>Wyschnegradsky segment was *perfect*.  To close, Alejandro Sanchez tickled<br/>the Dinarra to some Jazz standards, which was most enjoyable, if it did<br/>suffer from a poor amplification setup.</p><p>I gather recent talk of Judith Conrad&apos;s performance was about the Bach,<br/>since _Ill Tempered_ seemed to come off without a hitch.  Throughout<br/>the concert, the basketball was annoying, but the acoustics and general<br/>atmosphere of the venue were excellent.  I can understand the classical<br/>performer&apos;s quarrels with the way the event is organized, compared to<br/>a normal &quot;concert&quot;, but given the sheer variety of musical styles<br/>being presented, and our usual microtonal situation, Reinhard&apos;s event<br/>is nothing short of amazing.</p><p>I will say that I&apos;m not sure I approved of the Partch, even though I<br/>have been highly critical of the &quot;Partch purists&quot; on this list in the<br/>past...  In general, I feel the event could probably be more successful<br/>if Reinhard&apos;s AFMM ensemble did fewer numbers, making the show shorter.</p><p>-Carl</p></div><h3><a id=15504 href="#15504">ðŸ”—</a>Paul H.

The keyboard mapping for this piece was the one described in my<br/>message of 10/23, reproduced below, and the two types of scales in this<br/>mapping have been discussed more recently by David Finnamore, Dan Stearns<br/>and myself . . . perhaps Manuel should include this mapping in Scala?:</p><p>*******************************************************************</p><p>In preparing for the Microthon, I tuned my keyboard to a &quot;normal&quot;<br/>(i.e., octaves are still octaves) 12-tone mapping that includes the 7-<br/>out-of-22 scale that we discussed recently, the quasi-equal<br/>heptatonic (numbers indicate interval sizes in 22nds of an octave):</p><p>&apos;D&apos;(3)&apos;E&apos;(3)&apos;F&apos;(3)&apos;G&apos;(4)&apos;A&apos;(3)&apos;B&apos;(3)&apos;C&apos;(3)&apos;D&apos;</p><p>Again, this scale reminded Ara Sarkissian of the music of some Arabic<br/>land (I forget which), and, as Dave Keenan pointed out, also happens<br/>to have four excellent triads: &apos;D minor&apos;, &apos;E minor&apos;, &apos;F major&apos;,<br/>and &apos;G major&apos; (thus &apos;D minor 7&apos; and &apos;E minor 7&apos; are also excellent).<br/>It&apos;s a great scale to play around with since it combines a very non-<br/>Western melodic structure with some familiar, near-5-limit-JI<br/>harmonies.</p><p>When I tuned this, I rather arbitrarily tuned the black keys to other<br/>22-tET pitches.</p><p>I woke up today thinking it would be nice if there were some way to<br/>use the black keys to allow a modulation to a hyper-Pythagorean<br/>diatonic scale, whose Aeolian mode has nearly just 6:7:9 triads as<br/>its i, iv, and v. Well, I figured out how to do this and, lo and<br/>behold, my keyboard was already tuned that way! And, furthermore, not<br/>one but _three_ hyper-Pythagorean diatonic scales were lurking there!<br/>Behold:</p><p>D(2)D#(1)E(3)E#(1)F#(2)&apos;G&apos;(2)G#(2)&apos;A&apos;(2)A#(1)B(3)B#(1)C#(2)D</p><p>The hyper-Pythagorean Aeolian scales available are</p><p>G# A# B C# D# E F# G#<br/>D# E# F# G# A# B C# D#</p><p>and</p><p>A# B# C# D# E# F# G# A#</p><p>One could play with this mapping forever (though I like to be able to<br/>switch to the other two I&apos;ve suggested here and programmed on my<br/>keyboard, which are the hexachordal dodecatonic scale and the 12-tone<br/>hyper-Pythagorean scale -- each multi-trick ponies as well)!</p></div><h3><a id=15528 href="#15528">ðŸ”—</a>manuel.op.de.coul@eon-benelux.com</h3><span>11/15/2000 12:44:23 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Paul wrote:<br/>&gt;Thanks Carl!
