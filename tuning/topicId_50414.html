There<br/>  are never any accidentals used. Each note has its own name. Every note is a color and every<br/>  color is a note. A color-coded strip is placed across the keyboard as a reference.

Is there a website besides <a href="http://sonic-arts.org">sonic-arts.org</a> that explains microtonal terms? What&apos;s<br/>   really sad is I&apos;m not sure &quot;chain of best fifths&quot; is a microtonal term or not.

If it works for you and your instrument, go for it.</p><p>I suppose that could be considered a form of keyboard tablature (a<br/>notation that tells you directly where to put your fingers) as much as<br/>an encoding of pitch.</p><p>But of course it wouldn&apos;t necessarily be the best format for other<br/>purposes such as for playing other instruments or for analysing harmony.</p><p>&gt;  Or any other way?

What&apos;s<br/>&gt;     really sad is I&apos;m not sure &quot;chain of best fifths&quot; is a<br/>microtonal term<br/>&gt; or not. Thanks.</p><p>In this case what I mean by &quot;chain of best fifths&quot; notation is to find<br/>the closest approximation to a 2:3 frequency ratio in the equal<br/>temperament and notate a chain of 7 of these as FCGDAE, unless the<br/>circle closes before 7, as it does in the case of 15-EDO, in which<br/>case we center on D for an odd number and on the DA fifth for an even<br/>number.</p><p>The number of degrees making the best fifth in n-EDO is given by<br/>Round(n*ln(3/2)/ln(2)).</p><p>The best fifth of 15-EDO is 3 degrees which of course closes a circle<br/>after it is chained five times, CGDAE. Then we need accidentals which<br/>take us up and down by one degree to get us to the other two parallel<br/>closed chains. In Sagittal we suggest using the accidental that<br/>represents the 5-comma (81/80). Then, for example, the closest<br/>approximation to a just major triad on C is notated C E\ G, as it is<br/>in just about every other tuning where the 5-comma doesn&apos;t vanish.</p><p>Blackwood&apos;s notation works this way too but rather than limit the<br/>nominals to CGDAE he allows B as a synonym for C and F as a synonym<br/>for E, and goes further to allow sharps and flats so that the<br/>following notes above each other are synonyms.<br/>Dd Ab Eb Bb F<br/>C  G  D  A  E<br/>B  F# C# G# D#</p></div>
