I believe 28 is doubly (or quadruply)<br/>negative. What is interesting from a notational standpoint is<br/>that the chain of fifths closes at 7-equal, resulting in<br/># = b = 0.  (i.e., C = C# = Cx etc...)</p><p>So I said, &quot;hey, I&apos;ll just PRETEND that # = -b = 2&quot; and then<br/>fill the remaining blanks with arrows&quot;.</p><p>C C^ C# Dv D D^ D# Ev E E^ E# Fv F etc...<br/>     Db         Eb         Fb</p><p>This seems like such a practical notation for 28, preserves<br/>12 identities (C# = Db, Cx = D, except at E-F and B-C) and<br/>probably has nothing to do with any commas.</p><p>Oh well,</p><p>Bob Valentine</p></div>
