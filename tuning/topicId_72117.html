I read the Mills list early on, but did not contribute for at least two years (email access being spotty here then), so my memory may well be faulty there as well. In any case, it&apos;d be nice to get this bit of history right.</p><p>Daniel Wolf</p></div><h3><a id=72119 href="#72119">ðŸ”—</a>Carl Lumma &#x3C;clumma@yahoo.com&#x3E;</h3><span>6/29/2007 9:36:40 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, Daniel Wolf &lt;djwolf@...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; A small question about the tuning list history.

When his output exceeded what that could handle , that is when he put out his xenharmonic bulletins.<br/>By the time of the alliance, Ivor had stopped putting out most of this . by the time he was in Glendale, his resources were much more limited.<br/>--<br/>Kraig Grady<br/>North American Embassy of Anaphoria Island &lt;<a href="http://anaphoria.com/index.html">http://anaphoria.com/index.html</a>&gt;<br/>The Wandering Medicine Show<br/>KXLU &lt;<a href="http://www.kxlu.com/main/index.asp">http://www.kxlu.com/main/index.asp</a>&gt; 88.9 FM Wed 8-9 pm Los Angeles</p></div>
