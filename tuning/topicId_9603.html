You should definitely<br/>&gt; re-negotiate or go elsewhere.  While income from score sales are negligible<br/>&gt; (rentals can be more lucrative), no publisher of serious music (Peters,<br/>&gt; Schott, Boosey etc.)  should get any more than half of the licence fees for<br/>&gt; performances, broadcasts and mechanicals.</p><p>Hi DJW...</p><p>I think there may be a little misunderstanding here.  When I spoke of<br/>the 10%, I was only talking about SALES.  As far as the collection of<br/>royalties is concerned, the publisher collects half and I collect half<br/>-- 50%, 50%.</p><p>I&apos;m pretty sure this arrangement, including the 10% of sales receipts,<br/>has been the &quot;traditional&quot; music publishing arrangement over the years..<br/>but, of course, I could be wrong...</p><p>They used to say that the composer owned 100% of the royalties, and the<br/>publisher ALSO owned 100% of the royalties, equalling 200%... but, of<br/>course, they weren&apos;t very good at math... obviously.</p><p>_________ _____ ____ __ _ _</p><p>Joseph Pehrson</p></div>
