I told him<br/>that no, at least in the _Essay on Musical Intervals_,<br/>Woolhouse used 5-limit JI as his harmonic/melodic basis,<br/>but that his goal was to construct a temperament that had<br/>only one size for the &apos;whole tone&apos;, to prevent commatic<br/>drift, and two sizes of &apos;semitone&apos;, to simulate the differences<br/>apparent in JI.</p><p>He mentions nothing about harmonic identities higher than<br/>5 except in his chapter on &apos;harmonics&apos;, where he is content<br/>to show how to produce them, but offers no advice or comment<br/>on how musically useful they may be.</p><p>John&apos;s reply got me started on something that I thought<br/>might interest others here.  See my &apos;Tutorial on ancient<br/>Greek Tetrachord-theory&apos; if you don&apos;t understand the Greek<br/>note-names:<br/><a href="http://www.ixpres.com/interval/monzo/aristoxenus/tutorial.htm">http://www.ixpres.com/interval/monzo/aristoxenus/tutorial.htm</a></p><p>Since the theory of tetrachord division was normally<br/>assumed to be replicated identically in all other tetrachords,<br/>I didn&apos;t bother giving a description of the larger aspects<br/>of Greek theory there, so the tetrachord names aren&apos;t in my<br/>tutorial.  They are as follows, with abbreviations and English<br/>translations:</p><p>Hyperbolaion  hyper.  superfluous/furthest (lyre position)<br/>Diezeugmenon  diez.   disjunct (= not connected to _mese_)<br/>Synemmenon    syn.    conjunct (= connected to _mese_)<br/>Meson         mes.    middle<br/>Hypaton       hypat.  highest/nearest (lyre position)</p><p>Note that because the lowest-pitched lyre string was the<br/>highest in position and nearest the player (as on the modern<br/>guitar), the note names do not reflect the pitch-height.</p><p>-----------------------------------</p><p>&gt; [John Chalmers, private communication]<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I was wrong, it was Ousely who proposed the 19/16 minor third<br/>&gt; and the 24/19 complement (16:19:24 triad). The reference is<br/>&gt; in Shirlaw&apos;s book.</p><p>Interesting, thanks.  Don&apos;t know anything about Ousley<br/>- tell me more.  I&apos;ll have to include him in my book, in<br/>the &apos;19&apos; chapter.</p><p>Here are some other &apos;19&apos;ers&apos; I dug out of my book.<br/>You&apos;re probably aware of most if not all, but I decided<br/>to write this for you anyway, because I can print it out<br/>and add it to my book - some of this stuff isn&apos;t there.</p><p>ERATOSTHENES<br/>------------</p><p>I don&apos;t recall if Eratosthenes used the GPS/LPS [Greater<br/>Perfect System / Lesser Perfect System] format in his<br/>descriptions.  But he lived in the century following<br/>Aristoxenus, who was the first to use it, so I suppose it&apos;s<br/>fair to assume it for Eratosthenes.</p><p>At any rate, he proposed ratios of 13 for his enharmonic<br/>_tritai_ and _parhypate_, and ratios of 19 for his chromatic<br/>_tritai_ and _parhypate_ and enharmonic _paranetai_ and<br/>_lichanoi_.</p><p>If his ratios are assumed to compose a GPS/LPS, there is<br/>a 16:19:24 &apos;minor&apos; triad available on:</p><p>30/19  chromatic trite hyperb. / enharmonic paranete hyperb.<br/> 5/4   chromatic paranete diezeugmenon<br/>20/19  chromatic trite syn. / enharmonic paranete synemmenon</p><p>And most likely those combinations would not have been<br/>used in ancient Greek music... or would they?<br/>At any rate, a modern explorer in this tuning could<br/>make use of the 16:19:24 &apos;minor&apos; chord.</p><p>But the most interesting thing I find in Eratosthenes is<br/>the 1215:1216 [= ~1.42 cents] 3==19 xenharmonic bridge, between:<br/>(all cents values measured up or down from _mese_)</p><p>256/243 [= ~90.2 cents] diatonic trite synemmenon<br/> 20/19  [= ~88.8 cents] chr. trite syn. / enh. paranete syn.</p><p>128/81 [= ~792.2 cents] diatonic trite hyperbolaion<br/> 30/19 [= ~790.8 cents] chr. trite hyperb. / enh. paranete hyperb.</p><p>64/81 [= ~-407.8 cents] diatonic parhypate meson<br/>15/19 [= ~-409.2 cents] chr. parhypate meson / enh. lichaonos mes.</p><p>32/27 [= ~294.1 cents] dia. trite diez. / dia. paranete syn.<br/>45/38 [= ~292.7 cents] chr. trite diez. / enh. paranete diez.</p><p>16/27 [= ~-905.9 cents] diatonic parhypate hypaton<br/>45/76 [= ~-907.3 cents] chr. parhypate hypat. / enh. lich. hypat.</p><p>Of course, his measurements were based on superparticular<br/>proportions, so that&apos;s why he insisted on using those 19-limit<br/>ratios that are so close to the 3-limit ones, because they<br/>formed superparticular relationships that the 3-limit ones<br/>didn&apos;t.</p><p>BOETHIUS<br/>--------</p><p>Boethius calculated his chromatic _paranetai_ and _lichanoi_,<br/>and his enharmonic _tritai_ and _parhypatai_, as simple<br/>arithmetic means between the notes found in his diatonic.<br/>This resulted in 19-limit ratios in his chromatic genus.</p><p>The monochord string-lengths for his chromatic _paranetai_<br/>were calculated according to the formula:</p><p>diatonic paranete + ((diatonic paranete - nete) / 2)</p><p>and similarly, the chromatic _lichanoi_ were:</p><p>diatonic lichanos + ((diatonic lichanos - mese OR hypate) / 2)</p><p>There are therefore 16:19:24 &apos;minor&apos; triads on:</p><p>32/19  chr. paranete hyperb.<br/> 4/3   nete synemmenon<br/>64/57  chr. paranete syn.</p><p>24/19  chr. paranete diez.<br/> 1/1   mese<br/>16/19  chr. lichanos meson</p><p>And Boethius&apos;s system contains the 512:513 [= ~3.38 cents]<br/>3==19 xenharmonic bridge between:</p><p>9/8 [= ~203.9 cents] paramese<br/>64/57 [= ~200.5 cents] chr. paranete synemmenon</p><p>GANASSI<br/>-------</p><p>Ganassi 1543 proposed a 12-tone scale that used three ratios<br/>of 17 and two of 19 for the five chromatic notes.  It gave<br/>a C#/Db-minor triad of</p><p>  20/19 : 5/4 : 30/19<br/>=  16   : 19  :  24</p><p>(interestingly, exactly the same one as in Eratosthenes...)</p><p>and a G#/Ab-minor of</p><p>   30/19 : 15/8 : 40/17<br/>=   816  :  969 :  1216</p><p>which is obviously nowhere near as euphonious.<br/>It has the 16:19 &apos;minor 3rd&apos;, but the &apos;fifth&apos; is a 51:76<br/>[= ~691 cents], which I suppose wouldn&apos;t be objectionable<br/>to a later listener who&apos;s used to meantone.</p><p>The string-lengths for Ganassi&apos;s entire scale have<br/>nice low-integer proportions which reduce to a simple<br/>pattern:</p><p> /1   /4   /5   /6</p><p> 60   15   12   10      &apos;octave&apos;<br/> 64   16<br/> 68   17<br/> 72   18        12<br/> 76   19<br/> 80   20 - 16           3/2<br/> 85        17<br/> 90        18 - 15      4/3<br/> 96   24        16<br/>102             17<br/>108   27        18<br/>114             19<br/>120   30        20      entire string</p><p>-monz</p><p>Joseph L.
