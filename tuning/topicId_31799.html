Other shruti sizes, obtained by<br/>subtraction, are:<br/>     4 - 3 = 1 that is, 9/8 / 10/9 = 81/80 ................. 22 cents<br/>     3 - 2 = 1 that is, 10/9 / 16/15 = 25/24 ............... 70   &quot;<br/>     3 - 2 = 1 that is, 10/9 / 135/128 = 256/243 ........... 90   &quot;<br/>     2 - 1 = 1 that is, 16/15 / 81/80 = 256/243<br/>           = 1 that is, 16/15 / 25/24 = 128/125 ............ 52   &quot;<br/>           = 1 that is, 135/128 / 81/80 = 25/24<br/>           = 1 that is, 135/128 / 256/243 = 32805/32768 ....  6   &quot;<br/>     But they are not mentioned anywhere.  In fact no ratio, no<br/>fraction, no log value, no multiplication, has been mentioned.  Only<br/>the mathematical operations of addition have sufficed for expressing<br/>any concept, including consonance, vadi-samvadi etc.</p><p>Note: 25/24 has come to be known as nyoona shruti. 256/243,<br/>as &apos;poorana&apos; (?).  I have noted these latter two names in the few<br/>notes I have, the source not mentioned.</p><p>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; I wonder when this terminology has its origins, &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;</p><p>     &quot;pramana&quot; means the authentic source, the standard. While the<br/>word &apos;shruti&apos; occurs as early as in Narada-shiksha( 1st century AD),<br/>Natya-shastra (2nd century AD), the word &apos;pramana&apos; has not been used<br/>even in Sangitaratnakara (15th century AD). By inference, it came to<br/>be used later.  I do not know the date.</p><p>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; and in particular, if any other sizes of shruti were also named<br/>and/or described at that time. &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;</p><p>Not as far as I know.  I have not read Lentz&apos; book, and do not know<br/>if he mentions this point.</p><p>The topic of &quot;shruti&quot; remains as abstruse, contentious, and<br/>controversial as ever.</p><p>Regards,<br/>Haresh.</p></div><h3><a id=31823 href="#31823">ðŸ”—</a>paulerlich &#x3C;paul@stretch-music.com&#x3E;</h3><span>12/21/2001 1:30:08 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In tuning@y..., &quot;hbakshi1&quot; &lt;hareshbakshi@h...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt; --- In tuning@y..., &quot;paulerlich&quot; &lt;paul@s...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt; Message 31799 of 31801<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Are you familiar with the concept of the &quot;pramana shruti&quot;?<br/>&gt; This is, in modern times, explained as the smallest size of shruti,<br/>&gt; with ratio 81:80. &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Yes Paul, I am very familiar.
