It belonged here first anyway, because even<br/>tho it features a lot of simple math, any further commentary<br/>will probably be off-topic for that list but good for this one.<br/>Enjoy.</p><p>--- In tuning-math@y..., &quot;monz&quot; &lt;joemonz@y...&gt; wrote:</p><p><a href="http://groups.yahoo.com/group/tuning-math/message/44">http://groups.yahoo.com/group/tuning-math/message/44</a></p><p>&gt; --- In tuning-math@y..., &quot;Paul Erlich&quot; &lt;paul@s...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; <a href="http://groups.yahoo.com/group/tuning-math/message/24">http://groups.yahoo.com/group/tuning-math/message/24</a><br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I wrote,<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; hence as 33/32 and 13/12 -- differed by virtually an entire<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; semitone (i.e., Schoenberg assumed a &quot;unison vector&quot; of<br/>143:128).<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Oops! That should be 104:99, not 143:128!<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; But for sure, the 12-integer-limit is in _Harmonielehre_.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Really? So ratios such as 16:9 would have fallen outside it?</p><p>(early response:)</p><p>Oops... Schoenberg doesn&apos;t actually claim that the 12th<br/>harmonic is any kind of limit... it&apos;s simply where his<br/>musical illustration and its accompanying explanation end.<br/>I suppose he implies that it continues beyond into<br/>inaudibility.</p><p>The musical illustration uses the 1st thru 12th harmonics<br/>on F, C, and G.  So using a 12-integer-limit here would<br/>relate it to Schoenberg&apos;s illustration, but not necessarily<br/>to his actual theory.</p><p>In the later article, &quot;Problems of Harmony&quot;, which BTW<br/>was written in 1927 then revised in 1934 for presentation<br/>in America, Schoenberg definitely explains harmony as<br/>being based on a 13-integer-limit as harmonics 1 thru 13<br/>on F, C, and G.</p><p>I would label this system as (1...13)/(3^(-1...1)).</p><p>Is there a better notation for that?</p><p>Still later, in _Structural Functions of Harmony_ [1949],<br/>his &quot;Chart of the Regions&quot; (2 versions, in major and minor)<br/>uses terms such as &quot;mediant&quot; which imply more extended<br/>5-limit derivations for some notes than the ratios implied<br/>by the overtone model.</p><p>====</p><p>That was my first response to this.</p><p>I was going to concede to Paul that I had been in error,<br/>and to some extent I *was*, but guess what?... The scale<br/>of approximated ratios implied by Schoenberg&apos;s diagram<br/>provides only one 16:9!, between d-27 and c-48.</p><p>There are 3 other varieties of &quot;minor 7th&quot;:</p><p>  11:6 (really a &quot;neutral 7th&quot;) between d-54 and c-99,</p><p>  9:5 between b-45 and a-80, and</p><p>  7:4 between g-36 and f-63.</p><p>I was getting concerned that this thread was veering<br/>off-topic, but this gives me the opportunity to remedy<br/>that situation.   :)</p><p>(My quotes of Schoenberg are from the English translation<br/>of _Harmonielehre_ by Roy Carter, and the page numbers<br/>refer to that edition.)</p><p>Schoenberg [p 23] posits the existences of two &quot;forces&quot;, one<br/>pulling downward and one pulling upward around the tonic,<br/>which he illustrates as: F &lt;- C -&gt; G and likens to resistance<br/>against gravity.  In mathematical terms, he is referring to<br/>the harmonic relationships of 3^-1 and 3^1, respectively.</p><p>&gt; [Schoenberg, p 24:]<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; ...thus it is explained how the scale that finally emerged<br/>&gt; is put together from the most important components of a<br/>&gt; fundamental tone and its nearest relatives.  These nearest<br/>&gt; relatives are just what gives the fundamental tone stability;<br/>&gt; for it represents the point of balance between their opposing<br/>&gt; tendencies.  This scale appears as the residue of the properties<br/>&gt; of the three factors, as a vertical projection, as addition:</p><p>Schoenberg then presents a diagram of the overtones and the<br/>resulting scale, which I have adaptated, adding the partial-numbers<br/>which relate all the overtones together as a single set:</p><p>             b-45<br/>             g-36<br/>       e-30<br/>             d-27<br/>       c-24<br/> a-20<br/>       g-18  g-18<br/> f-16<br/> c-12  c-12<br/> f-8</p><p> f   c   g   a   d   e   b<br/> 8  12  18  20  27  30  45</p><p>&gt; [Schoenberg:]<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Adding up the overtones (omitting repetitions) we get the seven<br/>&gt; tones of our scale.  Here they are not yet arranged consecutively.<br/>&gt; But even the scalar order can be obtained if we assume that the<br/>&gt; further overtones are also in effect.  And that assumption is<br/>&gt; in fact not optional; we must assume the presence of the other<br/>&gt; overtones.  The ear could also have defined the relative pitch<br/>&gt; of the tones discovered by comparing them with taut strings,<br/>&gt; which of course become longer or shorter as the tone is lowered<br/>&gt; or raised.  But the more distant overtones were also a<br/>&gt; dependable guide.  Adding these we get the following:</p><p>Schoenberg then extends the diagram to include the<br/>following overtones:</p><p> fundamental  partials</p><p>     F         2...12, 16<br/>     C         2...11<br/>     G         2...12</p><p>(Note, therefore, that he is not systematic in his employment<br/>of the various partials.)</p><p>Again, I adapt the diagram by adding partial-numbers:</p><p>               d-108<br/>               c-99<br/>               b-90<br/>               a-81<br/>               g-72<br/>        f-66<br/> f-64<br/>              (f-63)<br/>        e-60<br/>        d-54   d-54<br/> c-48   c-48<br/>               b-45<br/> b-44<br/>       (bb-42)<br/> a-40<br/> g-36   g-36   g-36<br/> f-32<br/>        e-30<br/>(eb-28)<br/>               d-27<br/> c-24   c-24<br/> a-20<br/>        g-18   g-18<br/> f-16<br/> c-12   c-12<br/> f-8</p><p>       (eb)            (bb)<br/> c   d   e   f   g   a   b   c   d   e   f   g   a   b   c   d<br/>                       [44]            [64]<br/>       (28)            (42)            [66]<br/>24  27  30  32  36  40  45  48  54  60  63  72  81  90  99 108</p><p>(Note also that Schoenberg was unsystematic in his naming<br/>of the nearly-1/4-tone 11th partials, calling 11th/F by the<br/>higher of its nearest 12-EDO relatives, &quot;b&quot;, while calling<br/>11th/C and 11th/G by the lower, &quot;f&quot; and &quot;c&quot; respectively.<br/>This, ironically, is the reverse of the actual proximity<br/>of these overtones to 12-EDO: ~10.49362941, ~5.513179424,<br/>and ~0.532729432 Semitones, respectively).</p><p>The partial-numbers are also given for the resulting scale<br/>at the bottom of the diagram, showing that 7th/F (= eb-28)<br/>is weaker than 5th/C (= e-30), and 7th/C (= bb-42) is weaker<br/>than 5th/G (= b-45).</p><p>Also note that 11th/F (= b-44), 16th/F (= f-64) and 11th/C<br/>(= f-66) are all weaker still, thus I have included them in<br/>square brackets.  These overtones are not even mentioned by<br/>Schoenberg.</p><p>Schoenberg does take note of the ambiguity present in this<br/>collection of ratios, in his later article _Problems of Harmony_.<br/>I won&apos;t go into that here because this is focusing on his<br/>1911 theory.</p><p>Here is an interval matrix of Schoenberg&apos;s scale<br/>(broken in half to fit the screen), with implied<br/>proportions given along the left and the bottom,<br/>and Semitone values of the intervals in the body.</p><p>Because Schoenberg&apos;s implied proportions form an<br/>&quot;octave&quot;-specific pitch-set in his presentation<br/>(not necessarily in his theory), this matrix has<br/>no &quot;bottom&quot; half.</p><p>Interval Matrix of Schoenberg&apos;s implied JI scale:</p><p>108 26.04 24.00 23.37 22.18 21.06 19.02 17.20 16.35 15.55 15.16 14.04<br/> 99 24.53 22.49 21.86 20.67 19.55 17.51 15.69 14.84 14.04 13.65 12.53<br/> 90 22.88 20.84 20.21 19.02 17.90 15.86 14.04 13.19 12.39 12.00 10.88<br/> 81 21.06 19.02 18.39 17.20 16.08 14.04 12.22 11.37 10.57 10.18  9.06<br/> 72 19.02 16.98 16.35 15.16 14.04 12.00 10.18  9.33  8.53  8.14  7.02<br/> 66 17.51 15.47 14.84 13.65 12.53 10.49  8.67  7.82  7.02  6.63  5.51<br/> 64 16.98 14.94 14.31 13.12 12.00  9.96  8.14  7.29  6.49  6.10  4.98<br/> 63 16.71 14.67 14.04 12.84 11.73  9.69  7.86  7.02  6.21  5.83  4.71<br/> 60 15.86 13.82 13.19 12.00 10.88  8.84  7.02  6.17  5.37  4.98  3.86<br/> 54 14.04 12.00 11.37 10.18  9.06  7.02  5.20  4.35  3.55  3.16  2.04<br/> 48 12.00  9.96  9.33  8.14  7.02  4.98  3.16  2.31  1.51  1.12  0.00<br/> 45 10.88  8.84  8.21  7.02  5.90  3.86  2.04  1.19  0.39  0.00<br/> 44 10.49  8.45  7.82  6.63  5.51  3.47  1.65  0.81  0.00<br/> 42  9.69  7.65  7.02  5.83  4.71  2.67  0.84  0.00<br/> 40  8.84  6.80  6.17  4.98  3.86  1.82  0.00<br/> 36  7.02  4.98  4.35  3.16  2.04  0.00<br/> 32  4.98  2.94  2.31  1.12  0.00<br/> 30  3.86  1.82  1.19  0.00<br/> 28  2.67  0.63  0.00<br/> 27  2.04  0.00<br/> 24  0.00<br/>      24    27    28    30    32    36    40    42    44    45    48</p><p>---</p><p>108 12.00 10.18  9.33  9.06  8.53  7.02  4.98  3.16  1.51  0.00<br/> 99 10.49  8.67  7.82  7.55  7.02  5.51  3.47  1.65  0.00<br/> 90  8.84  7.02  6.17  5.90  5.37  3.86  1.82  0.00<br/> 81  7.02  5.20  4.35  4.08  3.55  2.04  0.00<br/> 72  4.98  3.16  2.31  2.04  1.51  0.00<br/> 66  3.47  1.65  0.81  0.53  0.00<br/> 64  2.94  1.12  0.27  0.00     &#x9;<br/> 63  2.67  0.84  0.00<br/> 60  1.82  0.00<br/> 54  0.00<br/>      54    60    63    64    66    72    81    90    99    108</p><p>-monz<br/><a href="http://www.monz.org">http://www.monz.org</a><br/>&quot;All roads lead to n^0&quot;</p><p>--- End forwarded message ---</p></div>
