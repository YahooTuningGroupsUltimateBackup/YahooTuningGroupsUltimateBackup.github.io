It was totally awesome and one of the best parts of<br/>the whole summer, even including Yosemite and skydiving. I wouldn&apos;t<br/>have known about it if not for this list.</p><p>This summer I&apos;m going to Los Alamos National Lab to work on a plasma<br/>physics project, and I was wondering if there are any microtonal<br/>concerts or other events in that general area. I&apos;ll be in Los Alamos<br/>most of the time, but I&apos;ll most likely visit Santa Fe at least once,<br/>and maybe even Albuquerque or other places. If anyone who lives there<br/>just wants to jam or something, that&apos;s cool too.</p><p>Keenan</p></div>
