I sometimes contribute to a jazz<br/>guitar forum and some members occasionally post backing tracks for the<br/>other intrepid members to try to solo over. In a best case scenario<br/>this is a kind of healthy, hands-on problem solving exercise,<br/>unfortunately no one ever seems to have put an art-first approach to<br/>the idea of a backing track and so far they&apos;ve all been pretty, err,<br/>Love Boat! Oh well, usually I&apos;d approach a samba or a bossa nova hoping<br/>for something a little more interactive. But this sort of<br/>canned ,clockwork jazz-in-a-box track obviates any attempt in that<br/>direction, so I just hada little fun laying waaaaay back and roughing<br/>up the changes and the time--and the intonation--a bit .</p><p><a href="http://zebox.com/daniel_anthony_stearns/">http://zebox.com/daniel_anthony_stearns/</a></p><p>joe&apos;Samba<br/>(bottom of page</p></div>
