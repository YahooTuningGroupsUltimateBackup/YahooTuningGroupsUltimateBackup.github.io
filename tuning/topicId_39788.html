Either is regarded by<br/>Jacobus of Liege (c. 1325) as perfectly concordant, but with the first<br/>form generally preferable.</p><p>This preference, however, may vary: around 1030, Guido d&apos;Arezzo in his<br/>_Micrologus_ prefers the 3:4 fourth to the 2:3 fifth as a basic<br/>interval, and advocates the placement of the fourth below the fifth in<br/>a technique of three-voice singing which involves a series of 3:4:6<br/>sonorities.</p><p>If we want a name for the 3:4:6 reflecting later stylistic trends<br/>around the 13th century, we could call it a &quot;converse trine,&quot; since<br/>the intervals are said to be arranged &quot;conversely&quot; (_e converso_) from<br/>the more conclusive 2:3:4 sonority with the fifth below the fourth.</p><p>A standard Gothic Pythagorean tuning, generally assumed in medieval<br/>European theory (with a few interesting variations), makes both the<br/>2:3:4 and its &quot;conversity&quot; of 3:4:6 pure.</p><p>In neo-medieval music, however, the fifths are often tuned somewhat<br/>wider than pure, and the fourths somewhat narrower, with about 2 cents<br/>of tempering standard.</p><p>It should be noted that in the 18th-19th century styles discussed by<br/>Jon Szanto, a complete 2:3:4 or 3:4:6 trine of medieval or<br/>neo-medieval styles would be considered some kind of incomplete<br/>sonority, for example a portion of a 4:5:6 triad. Similarly, in the<br/>21st-century decatonic harmony of Paul Erlich based on a complete<br/>4:5:6:7 tetrad, the complete 4:5:6 triad of 18th-century music would<br/>be considered an incomplete portion of a tetrad.</p><p>Most appreciatively,</p><p>Margo Schulter<br/><a href="mailto:mschulter@value.net">mschulter@value.net</a></p></div>
