I will<br/>be reading the messages on this list only until Monday or Tuesday,<br/>and after that, if anyone needs to contact me, I will continue to<br/>read my email -- just no extended discussions, please.</p><p>It&apos;s been over 3 years since I joined this forum, and several years<br/>prior to that I had already resumed working on things microtonal<br/>(following a &gt;15-year break).  I now find that I cannot continue to<br/>devote as much time and effort to this as I have these past several<br/>years, since I need to make more time available for other concerns<br/>that I have neglected.</p><p>It has always been a privilege (and often a joy) to share in these<br/>discussions, and I look forward to a time when I will be able to<br/>return.</p><p>In closing, I offer you a little something (off-topic) to ponder (or<br/>an opportunity to chuckle, as you wish):  &quot;If God does not exist,<br/>then it is cruel of him to have given false hope to those who believe<br/>in him.&quot;  ;-)</p><p>Goodbye for a season, and God bless you all!</p><p>--George Secor</p></div><h3>George D.

I&apos;ve enjoyed your writings, you are a model of refined and civil discourse, and you have frequently (and elegantly) blended the worlds of theory, research, and music in a holistic and convincing fashion. We&apos;re the better for it, George, and hope to have you back in the future at some point.</p><p>With all best wishes,<br/>Jon</p></div>
