Additionally, cents allows for<br/>&gt; the total intellectualization of all pitch &quot;points&quot; on the line of<br/>&gt; frequency to be immediately apprehended.  Most importantly, players<br/>&gt; always reference new pitches to constants -- like open strings and<br/>&gt; harmonics --  in order to find exotics.  Microtonal notations that<br/>&gt; represent moving relationships can lose their constants in pitch<br/>&gt; drift, making it difficult to come up with the necessary hand<br/>&gt; positions or fingerings to produce the appropriate sounds.  The<br/>&gt; solution is for all pitches to relate in a unified field in order to<br/>&gt; be fully prescriptive for players.   Cents also anchors us to present<br/>&gt; music tradition -- no small feat.</p><p>In my little experience with microtonal music (29tet, quasi-random,<br/>but actually ordered into u- and o-tonal regions involving the<br/>factors 7, 11, and 13 (i.e., intervals which along with fourth and<br/>fifth are represented fairly well by the temperament)) I was glad<br/>about the alternatives.</p><p>Some of us wanted - and did - stick to &quot;piano notation&quot; with cent<br/>deviations. They had discrete fingerings for each pitch figured out<br/>and used the staff for a rough representation of the melody. They<br/>had _no_ constants to refer to, each note was an entity by itself,<br/>and I think that this is the reason the notation worked for them.</p><p>If I - on a trombone - do not play excessively high, I cannot<br/>reference e.g. the 13th partial to a constant as postulated in the<br/>quote above, and if I do (as with all the lower partials), it only<br/>helps me playing very specific intervals that rarely occur in most<br/>music. But I can play relative fourths, fifths, or major tones from<br/>any starting pitch (gladly accepting overtones of Bb as constants if<br/>any should occur), and I can make myself play pythagorean thirds,<br/>too. The 29tet scale almost consists of major tones divided into<br/>five parts, so the practical notation for me came close to<br/>combinations of pythagorean whole tone scales with additional<br/>accidentals (+1, +2, -1, -2). Actually, one of the tones has to be<br/>minor and divided into 4 parts. Pythagorean notation singles out<br/>this interval as a diminished third. The steps then are 48c instead<br/>of 41c, which pitch drift may or may not iron out (as we didn&apos;t play<br/>along the scale and switched whole tone scales on intervals wider<br/>than a fifth, they never occurred).</p><p>I don&apos;t want to claim that I played this scale perfectly, but I<br/>always had the feeling that I knew what I should be doing. &quot;Play the<br/>note 21 steps down&quot; meant to go down a fifth (17 steps) and then 4<br/>fifths of a major tone. In &quot;piano notation&quot; it would be &quot;Go down<br/>900c and up 31c&quot;. Am I to learn 100c steps (how?) on an instrument<br/>where I will never use them?</p><p>I think different musics need different notations, and different<br/>intruments need different notations. The composer might want to use<br/>still another one. Why be more consistent than Partch?</p><p>klaus</p><p>&gt; Of course, by using enharmonic<br/>&gt; quartertones, one need not use numbers larger than 25 to indicate<br/>&gt; cents distinctions (recently pointed out by Paul Erlich, a<br/>&gt; subscriber to the internet&apos;s busy Tuning List).&quot;</p></div><h3>Pitchcolor@aol.com</h3><span>4/23/2001 5:38:08 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>In a message dated 4/23/01 7:18:38 PM, <a href="mailto:KSchmir@z.zgs.de">KSchmir@z.zgs.de</a> writes:</p><p>&lt;&lt; &gt; 1200 divisions of the octave being the very threshold of human</p><p>&gt; hearing for pitch differentiation.  &gt;&gt;</p><p>you&apos;re joking, right?<br/>perception of JNDs changes with register.  study your psychoacoustics.</p></div><h3>Afmmjr@aol.com</h3><span>4/23/2001 6:02:01 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>In a message dated 4/23/01 8:39:58 PM Eastern Daylight Time,<br/><a href="mailto:Pitchcolor@aol.com">Pitchcolor@aol.com</a> writes:</p><p>&gt; In a message dated 4/23/01 7:18:38 PM, <a href="mailto:KSchmir@z.zgs.de">KSchmir@z.zgs.de</a> writes:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &lt;&lt; &gt; 1200 divisions of the octave being the very threshold of human<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; hearing for pitch differentiation.  &gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; you&apos;re joking, right?<br/>&gt; perception of JNDs changes with register.  study your psychoacoustics.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;</p><p>Please enlighten: what are JNDs and how is this relevant to the ability to<br/>differentiate finer than a single cent?</p><p>Johnny Reinhard</p></div><h3>Afmmjr@aol.com</h3><span>4/23/2001 6:07:51 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>In a message dated 4/23/01 8:18:49 PM Eastern Daylight Time, <a href="mailto:KSchmir@z.zgs.de">KSchmir@z.zgs.de</a><br/>writes:</p><p>&gt; &quot;.
