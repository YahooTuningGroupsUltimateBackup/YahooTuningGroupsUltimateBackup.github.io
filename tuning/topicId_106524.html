How equal did I get the fifths, and so on?</p><p> (If it sounds good, then it&apos;s probably  an OK temperament.:)</p><p> But it can be useful to check the result with the original idea and see if the tuning contained unnecessary errors.</p><p> Examples:</p><p> Maybe one in passing  made a fifth wide instead of narrow. (Then the graph will go upward )</p><p> We also should be aware if a fifth is more impure than ca -180 TU. Such a fifth should have an function in the totality, in itself it should be avoided, and it may simply be a mistake that it became so.</p><p> A major third that is less than pure means that another third becomes unnecessarily impure, and the graphs are crossing each other (harmonic waste).</p><p> Maybe it&apos;s been a little &laquo;roller coaster&raquo; in the major thirds, Maybe Ab-C has been purer than both Db-F and Eb-G (each side in the circle of fifths).</p><p> It can be OK but also useful to know.</p><p> By studying the graphs, we can get an idea of &ZeroWidthSpace;&ZeroWidthSpace;how we can improve the tuning.</p><p> Testing a tuning by ears is not a completely objective judgment....</p><p> Under &quot;Play around with the temperaments&quot; you will find a link to the free LibreOffice</p><p> (This is the program I started with, but did not come further with )</p><p> After you finish tuning, you can with an app measure  frequencies for the 12 tones of the scale, one-line octave or thereabouts.</p><p> If the app misses with 0.1 Hz it will only be a margin of error of &lt;20 TU</p><p> If you click on the link &quot;Tune your instrument ..&quot; (still under &quot;Play around) and download the file &laquo;Check yourself..&raquo; and open it), you can&grave;t use Googles spreadsheet.<br/> so  you can there enter the frequencies. (E20-E31)</p><p> Then you will get a graph that is built on the same principle as in the blog, but the values &ZeroWidthSpace;&ZeroWidthSpace;you have to find in the spreadsheet instead of in the diagram.</p><p> Green (E column) is fifths and red (J column) is major thirds. (Blue is the minor third in</p><p> a major triad)</p><p> Are you accustomed with cents you will get precise enough numbers by dividing with 30.</p><p> To interpret the graph it is the absolute best to read  INTRODUCTION Part I <a href="http://thegraphicalguidetotunings.blogspot.no/p/welcome-to-graphical-guide-to-tunings_6.html">http://thegraphicalguidetotunings.blogspot.no/p/welcome-to-graphical-guide-to-tunings_6.html</a>, at least the first part of it.</p><p> Now we will focus on fifths and major thirds.</p><p> A horizontal line means pure fifths. The steeper, the more impure is a fifth.<br/>  The value you will find in column E (green).</p><p> To find the major third quality we have look at the vertical distance between the red and green graph.</p><p> The greater the distance, the more impure third.<br/>  And the value is in column J (red).</p><p> Now we look at a hypothetical experiment with Vallotti.</p><p> Vallotti you will find originally under Play around / THE FILES<br/> . (and of course in the blog with another layout)</p><p> <a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-EoFseonL9FM/VrBcwXMJdsI/AAAAAAAAHeI/5FwRhksSPsc/s1600/Vallotti.PNG">http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-EoFseonL9FM/VrBcwXMJdsI/AAAAAAAAHeI/5FwRhksSPsc/s1600/Vallotti.PNG</a></p><p> And here is the result in our example :</p><p> <a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-Y2TbktwN2HM/VrBcnbxE3MI/AAAAAAAAHeE/z5vUV7-CKjg/s1600/Fors%25C3%25B8k%2BII.PNG">http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-Y2TbktwN2HM/VrBcnbxE3MI/AAAAAAAAHeE/z5vUV7-CKjg/s1600/Fors%25C3%25B8k%2BII.PNG</a></p><p> It is a bit away from Vallotti. The errors you can see both in the green and red graph (red moved four fifths to the left, but the same curve).</p><p> We can see that the tuner has not quite succeeded in making equal fifths. It results in a bad fifth C-G (-200 TU) and G-D and D-A have been purer. A-E is also quite bad.</p><p> F-C is correct -120 and this steepness should be the same from F to B.</p><p> The major third G-H has been 260 TU instead of 180 TU. But not so bad that it is not good for anything: Eb-G have been purer, but maybe that was not the intention ....</p><p> ..................................</p><p> b)  A guessing game</p><p> Another good tip is to not necessarily tune a special temperament, but create something passable and so listen carefully to all the fifths and write down your guesses for all of them.</p><p> Is this fifth a 1/4 comma  ? (- 165 TU / -180 TU)</p><p> or</p><p> is it a 1/6 comma  ? (-110 TU / -120 TU) ?</p><p> You get the TU by dividing -720 TU for Pythagorean comma (or -660 for syntonic comma,nearly the same , I think you will not hear the difference).</p><p> Once you&apos;ve written down your guesses: measure the frequencies and put them into the spreadsheet (&laquo;Check yourself&raquo;) in E20-E31. You will then see the &laquo;set answer&raquo; in column E.</p><p> To be able to guess you must have some notions about fifth qualities. But I think this is a good method to get these notions if you not have them already. This is also a good way to get to know different values of the third quality. Even though it is more common to count beats ?</p><p> Now you can start this guessing game and improve yourself.</p><p> This has in any case been useful for me. :)</p><p> ..................</p><p> c)</p><p> I presume many here have their own personal touch on a temperement.</p><p> It can be fun and useful to see  such a tuning visualized, see the different intervals relative to each other . You are following the same procedure.</p><p> I have created a link to &laquo;cembalists own tunings&raquo; on my blog. You are welcome to give me your data . And I will post a diagram there with your name into it.</p><p> ...............</p><p> In this spreadsheet you can also play around with the graphs with column B and C . In column B, you can adjust a single tone.</p><p> In column C, you can enter the fifth quality. Just beware of interaction between B and C.</p><p> It is therefore important to relate to column E (green) as the correct numbers .</p><p> And extremely important: the sum in     E13 must always be -720 TU (pyth.comma)<br/> If E13 is not -720, E14 will show you which value have to put in column B.</p><p> It is also important to know that the numbers in E20-31 generates numbers in B20-31 which in turn generates the C1-C12</p><p> giving the numbers in the colored columns.</p><p>  It means that if you eg enter  numbers in C1-C12 so you can no longer use B20-31 and E20-31 . If you need it you must download the file again.</p><p> Good luck!</p></div>
