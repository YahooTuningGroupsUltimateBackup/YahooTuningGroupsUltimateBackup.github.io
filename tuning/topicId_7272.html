I<br/>&gt; suppose it&apos;s ominous, as it isn&apos;t in John Loffink&apos;s list, but I&apos;ve never<br/>&gt; heard for certain that it isn&apos;t capable.  It looks quite good otherwise.</p><p>Graham, I&apos;ve seen the manual. No tuning tables. Bollocks, as it is<br/>supposedly compatible with DX7 patches and the like. What is wrong with<br/>these people !? You&apos;d think that an asian instrument builder would be<br/>sensitive to the varying tuning needs of people around the world.</p><p>- Drew</p><p>_________________________________________________________<br/>Do You Yahoo!?<br/>Get your free <a href="https://twitter.com/yahoo">@yahoo</a>.com address at <a href="http://mail.yahoo.com">http://mail.yahoo.com</a></p></div>
