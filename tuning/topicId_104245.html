The peak of your success once you are fully instructed in cells matters is to buy the book.</p><p>Okay, I gather that you are talking about the book &quot;The Piagui Musical Scale: Perfecting Harmony&quot; (ISBN 1418446548). This is the kind of information I expected you to provide - I had no idea you had written this book. If you just say &quot;buy the book&quot; but don&apos;t give any information about it, not even the title, you&apos;re making all of us guess what you&apos;re talking about. Don&apos;t make us guess.</p><p>&gt; I suggest you fellows to pay attention on the Mike mailbox because the abstract might be readable in one or two or three sections but I prefer to send it at once. Be ready for that, it is advisable to be quite while reading the wanted info.</p><p>I don&apos;t understand what you mean by the phrase &quot;pay attention on the Mike mailbox&quot;. Do you mean an email inbox?

How am I supposed to pay attention to<br/>&gt; Mike&apos;s inbox when I can&apos;t read it because I&apos;m not Mike?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Keenan</p><p>I think he&apos;s telling me to pay attention. Like you and Wolf, I also<br/>asked him to explain his series, but I asked him offlist. At this<br/>point, it would be nice to figure out if everything is regularly<br/>mapped, and if so to name it &quot;Pizarro temperament&quot; and call it a day.</p><p>I note that if there are 613 cells, and one of them is the 2/1, that<br/>would be 612 unique pitches to the octave. Therefore, I very much<br/>expect that it&apos;ll be a rank-2 temperament supported by 612-EDO, which<br/>has gotten a fair amount of attention before:<br/><a href="http://xenharmonic.wikispaces.com/612edo">http://xenharmonic.wikispaces.com/612edo</a></p><p>-Mike</p></div><h3><a id=104250 href="#104250">ðŸ”—</a>Mike Battaglia &#x3C;battaglia01@...&#x3E;</h3><span>3/29/2012 3:11:31 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Also, Mario, before you get into your book and ideas on consonance, is<br/>there any way you can just list the formula for the cells in<br/>mathematical terms?
