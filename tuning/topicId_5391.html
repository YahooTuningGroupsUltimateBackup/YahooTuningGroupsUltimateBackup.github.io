Maybe not in the<br/>second<br/>&gt;octave. Eduardo?</p><p>The word Dinarra, (read deenarha) comes from &quot;guitaRRA DINAmica&quot;.<br/>Its theory is called Gama Dinamica, (that means Dynamic Scale or<br/>Dynamic Gamut).<br/>The two Dinarras played by my guys are refreted electric&quot;Washburn&quot;,<br/>(65 cm string length).<br/>Each one of them has 89 frets, it is a sixth minor (36 commas equal 8/5)</p><p>from the middle of each string. As I understand this is the portion you<br/>call<br/>&quot;second Octave&quot;.<br/>Well, I think in this area, the boys must play very well, without any<br/>problem.<br/>.They know how to study and how to play well.<br/>Nevertheless there are options. They know how to tune JI and how to<br/>untune as a way of musical expression. I have teached them, but the last</p><p>option appertain to them. They do hear the different options and<br/>choice one of them.<br/>I have invented my own rules to tune JI and to untune. There are a few<br/>rules but<br/>enough to start.</p><p>Eduardo</p></div>
