Thanks for acknowledging the hastiness of your initial reply, and<br/>that my solution was correct. As to the rest, I can see that you have a deep<br/>philosophy of scales and such that I shouldn&apos;t presume to understand, let<br/>alone dismiss, at such an early stage. So far, though, I find it very<br/>difficult to tease out what your philosophy is, so I can only focus on<br/>superficial details. Hopefully, our communication will improve in the future<br/>. . .
