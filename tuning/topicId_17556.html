This index would meet the conditions<br/>that I posted before, where both the 4th and 6th term are even<br/>numbers:</p><p>1, 4, 1, 6, 11, 18, ...</p><p>So a 6-out-of-18 should give a trivalent scale with an equal number of<br/>notes. Lets try it in the SMMLMM order that you originally gave your<br/>scale in:</p><p>0 133 333 533 800 1000 1200<br/>0 200 400 667 867 1067 1200<br/>0 200 467 667 867 1000 1200<br/>0 267 467 667 800 1000 1200<br/>0 200 400 533 733  933 1200<br/>0 200 333 533 733 1000 1200</p><p>Hmm, not trivalent! But wait, note that no rotation of the scale has<br/>the P/2 midpoint &quot;condition&quot;... so let&apos;s try abcbbb instead:</p><p>0 133 333 600 800 1000 1200<br/>0 200 467 667 867 1067 1200<br/>0 267 467 667 867 1000 1200<br/>0 200 400 600 733  933 1200<br/>0 200 400 533 733 1000 1200<br/>0 200 333 533 800 1000 1200</p><p>Ah, much better!</p><p>This fiddling with the scales step order is one reason why I always<br/>want a strong internal ordering rule in the various methods that I<br/>come up with here. The need to avoid chasing one&apos;s own tail looking<br/>for the &quot;right&quot; one is a strong one here!</p><p>Anyway, let me know if any of this is making any more sense now.</p><p>thanks,</p><p>--Dan Stearns</p></div>
