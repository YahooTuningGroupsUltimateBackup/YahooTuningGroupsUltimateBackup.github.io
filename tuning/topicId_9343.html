He didn&apos;t want to damage the &quot;binding&quot; (I forget if that&apos;s the term<br/>&gt;    he used) on either side of the fret-board (the white stuff on both<br/>&gt;    sides of the fretboard in the photos below).</p><p>(Yes, I believe that&apos;s the right term.)</p><p>I have to confess that the last time I did a refret job, I just sawed through it and then filled in the cuts<br/>afterward.  It turned out looking OK, but not as good as it could have.</p><p>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; 2. For some reason that is not clear to me, I think he was also worried<br/>&gt;    about cracking or breaking the wood in the fretboard.</p><p>Hmmm...  Interesting.  I can&apos;t think why either, but I&apos;ll be cautious of that.</p><p>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; What he ended up doing was filing off the tangs of the frets that he<br/>&gt; added and gluing them on.</p><p>With guitars, I&apos;ve done that for the frets over the soundbox, but have had no problems hammering the ones over<br/>the fingerboard.  Hammering, provided that you have the right kind of hammer of course, seems to work better,<br/>because it forces all points along the fret to go down to the shoulder and stay there.  Gluing is more difficult<br/>because it&apos;s much more critical that the fret exactly match the curvature of the neck.</p><p>But perhaps in this case it had something to do with mandolin frets been much smaller?  I can&apos;t think right off<br/>why that would matter, but perhaps there&apos;s something I&apos;m failing to anticipate.</p></div>
