I would have thought you had<br/>in place at least a plausible  hypothesis by this time.</p><p>The Vicentino piece, Musica prisca caput, is in 4  parts and is complete.<br/>The examples in Marchetto&apos;s Lucidarium are just  examples.</p><p>But both spoke of the 5-parts of the tone in  their works.  I&apos;d always<br/>believed Marchetto was using a spiral of  fifths-based tuning.  I see his whole tone<br/>as being made up of 2 sizes of  half tones, which can be reversed when<br/>arriving from the opposite  direction.  This makes for 4 points out of the 5<br/>proposed.  The final  point of pitch is the apotome, so named by Marchetto, which<br/>seems to mark the  first description of a sharpened pitch for resolving up by<br/>semitone, or the  &quot;leading&quot; tone.</p><p>The Douglas Frank Chorale performed the  Vicentino in just intonation.<br/>Vicentino described tuning as an ascending  set of 5 pitch points, 4 intervals, I<br/>have always believed Vicentino was using  the just intonation model for his<br/>theoretical pitch references.</p><p>best, Johnny</p><p>************************************** See what&apos;s new at <a href="http://www.aol.com">http://www.aol.com</a></p></div>
