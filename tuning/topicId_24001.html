I&apos;d like to hear the 22-tet progression<br/>improvisation!</p><p>Here are a few thoughts that might start a composition methods thread - I&apos;d be<br/>interested to hear what other have to say.</p><p>I&apos;ve tried improvising and notating each note as I play it, and that can impede<br/>the flow of ideas, as you say.</p><p>Also tried recording the improvisation to MIDI, then editing that, but the raw<br/>midi file needs a lot of work to make it into a score proper.</p><p>I know also some composers improvise into a program that quantises their playing,<br/>and that makes it easier to finish it into a score. I have just started trying out<br/>that approach, and it works rather well. In NWC, the way it works is that<br/>one makes a metronome track consisting of a bar, or several bars of percussion.<br/>Can have any number of notes in it, so one can do 5/4 or whatever.<br/>You then loop it, and play along with it, and NWC then quantizes your improvisation<br/>to the percussion track. You end up with a score of the piece.</p><p>The percussion is just a metronome, and on playback you have your playing on its own.</p><p>It&apos;s too early to say how much I&apos;ll use this approach. It is interesting to<br/>experiment with. When improvising my rhythms are generally far more flexible<br/>and varied than the ones one ends up with when using a metronome, and indeed I<br/>like to kind of encourage that, the kind of poetry of free rhythm - perhaps<br/>in reaction, as there are so many examples of metronomic rhythms around us<br/>that one feels it is nice to go the other way instead. So, not sure yet how<br/>well I will be able to learn to improvise to a metronome and input scores<br/>that way.</p><p>However, what I have followed up is a kind of visual approach. You start off<br/>working out each note on the keyboard, and typing it into the score, but at a<br/>certain point you start to see / intuit that it would be nice to place a few<br/>notes here on the score. Then, you begin to improvise visually.</p><p>It&apos;s particularly striking in my case as I can&apos;t yet look at a score and<br/>hear what it will sound like. I get enough of an idea of the shape of the tunes<br/>to follow music from a score, but not enough to hear it by looking at a score<br/>without the actual music playing.</p><p>However, what I find is that a certain point into a piece I can begin to<br/>place the notes visually, thinking, that&apos;s a nice place to put them. Then when<br/>I click the play button, it does indeed work, even though I don&apos;t know exactly<br/>what it is going to sound like. That&apos;s what I like to call visual improvisation.<br/>Kind of serendipity comes in too, works rather well.</p><p>Because I can&apos;t hear what I write anyway, then I find it works just as well<br/>if I have the score retuned to any arbitrary scale - after a certain point<br/>into the piece, one begins to intuit where to place the notes, kind of how<br/>the new notes will fit into the shape and pattern of the notes placed so far,<br/>and often the best work happens at that point.</p><p>If one does it too early though, then you just get nonsense - notes that look<br/>nice, but just sound like nonsense. So it isn&apos;t purely visual, but strongly<br/>visual.</p><p>Another nice thing about composing by typing into a score, even when working it<br/>out note by note on the keyboard, is that it is very conducive to sparse<br/>understated harmonies.</p><p>It helps to have a score editor that one can type notes into really quickly<br/>- I get the impression that they vary in this respect, and some give very<br/>nice typographical results, but aren&apos;t so fast to enter a score into from<br/>the p.c. keyboard.</p><p>Anyway, what I&apos;m particularly interested to hear about is to what extent<br/>the visual element enters into composition, and whether composers think<br/>there is such a thing as purely visual improvisation, and how it enters<br/>into their working methods.</p><p>Robert</p></div><h3><a id=24028 href="#24028">ðŸ”—</a>Paul Erlich &#x3C;paul@stretch-music.com&#x3E;</h3><span>5/30/2001 1:22:27 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In tuning@y..., &quot;Robert Walker&quot; &lt;robertwalker@n...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt; Hi Paul<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I enjoyed your post about improvisation.
