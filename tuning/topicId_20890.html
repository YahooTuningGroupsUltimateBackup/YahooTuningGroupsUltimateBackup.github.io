The &quot;class modulo 2&quot; part should not<br/>be a problem in the translation between French and English. The problem is<br/>&quot;interval&quot;. &quot;Interval&quot; requires two notes. One of them can be the tonic, if<br/>there even is a tonic. But maybe neither is the tonic. If you&apos;re always<br/>measuring the interval upwards from the tonic, then all you&apos;re doing is<br/>characterizing the pitch-height (or pitch-class, which is pitch-height<br/>modulo 2) of a tone.</p><p>In my opinion, the only conditions under which your &quot;intervals&quot;, which I<br/>call &quot;pitch heights&quot;, correspond to a sonance measure in the way you<br/>illustrate, is if the music is in two voices, and one voice holds the tonic<br/>_always_. Then each tone-ratio will also result in the identical<br/>interval-ratio, and sonance measure will be correct. However, precious<br/>little music is in this form.</p><p>And in the pre-tonal era, it can sometimes be next to impossible to assign<br/>one of the pitches as the &quot;tonic&quot;. Yet it is undeniable that sonance of<br/>intervals was a powerful feature of the diatonic scale in Medieval and<br/>Renaissance music.</p><p>I stop now in order to reiterate that this is just my view and to allow for<br/>responses.</p><p>Oops -- one more thing.</p><p>&gt;I also used sometimes &quot;ton&quot; in the sense of step with the same ambiguity we<br/>&gt;find in terms like diatonic (steps) and heptatonic (degrees).</p><p>I think you might be misunderstanding the etymology of the term diatonic.<br/>The term comes from the prefix dia-, meaning &quot;through&quot;, and _not_ from the<br/>prefix di-, meaning two. &quot;Diatonic&quot; simply means &quot;through the tones&quot; --<br/>specifically, through the tones of the ordinary heptatonic scale. The only<br/>difference between &quot;diatonic&quot; and &quot;heptatonic&quot; is that &quot;diatonic&quot; is a bit<br/>more specific, while any 7-tone scale can be &quot;heptatonic&quot;.

Pierre specifically said that it refers to the<br/>interval between the tonic and the note. What on earth is<br/>&gt; wrong with saying that the tones of the Zarlino JI scale are<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;  C    D    E    F    G    A     B    C&apos;<br/>&gt; 1/1, 9/8, 5/4, 4/3, 3/2, 5/3, 15/8, 2/1?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; These are the intervals between the tonic and the tones, yes, but<br/>they can also be understood to simply name the tones themselves. In<br/>fact, on this list we&apos;ve tried, many times, to adopt the convention<br/>that a ratio written with a slash (&quot;a/b&quot;) refers to a _tone_ or a<br/>_pitch_, with the ratio giving the relationship between that tone and<br/>the tonic; while a ratios written with a colon (&quot;a:b&quot;) refers to an<br/>interval between two tones.</p><p>Well, it does seem like a pretty good convention... David Doty, of<br/>course, advocates it as well in the JI Primer...</p><p>However, the RESULT is still ONE sounding &quot;thingy&quot; a pitch, or TONE,<br/>right... even if it&apos;s &quot;theoretical&quot; basis refers to its relationship<br/>to the tonic... Or am I misunderstanding something.</p><p>In any case, the notion of &quot;tone&quot; is different from the broad<br/>categories of &quot;sonance&quot; that Pierre is discussing in his posts...</p><p>Or, perhaps I was just reading the French wrong??
