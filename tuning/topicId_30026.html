Each<br/>member of this eclectic Toronto-based group is a composer, performer, and instrument-builder.<br/>Using traditional, modified, and custom-made instruments, Critical Band performs a range of works.<br/>Included among these is American maverick composer Harry Partch&apos;s Li Po Settings and Barstow, an<br/>arrangement of hitchhiker inscriptions collected by Partch, on reproductions of his<br/>instruments.Featuring New Yorkers Johnny Reinhard (leader of the American Festival of Microtonal<br/>Music) on voice and bassoon and Anastasia Solberg on viola as well as locals Willis on surragate<br/>chromelodeon (rebuilt from two accordions) and Gzowski on adapted guitar. They will also be adding<br/>a brass section playing &iuml;&iquest;&half;hoseaphones&iuml;&iquest;&half;  (garden hose natural brass) and Romano Dinillo on percussion<br/>for performances of new works by Garnet Willis, John Sherlock, Johnny Reinhard and John Gzowski.<br/>This is the first stop on a tour that includes dates in Winnipeg and Vancouver, presented by<br/>Groundswell and Vancouver New Music.</p><p>The music that surrounds us in North America is based on a that divides the octave into 12 notes.<br/>Microtonal music divides the octave into smaller unites; all  of this music uses a 43-note octave!.<br/> This offers a range of sound that takes us into new territory.  One of the most well-known<br/>proponents of microtonal music in North America was Harry Partch.  He was described as an &quot;American<br/>composer, librettist, philosopher, publisher, record distributor, teacher, satirist, instrument<br/>builder and designer, sculptor, instrument repairman and tuner, theorist, experimentalist,<br/>iconoclast, self-taught musician, percussionist, adapted violist, conductor, author, retired hobo,<br/>seaman, sewer cleaner, dishwasher and kitchen flunky, comedian, vagrant, member of the Percussive<br/>Arts Society Hall of Fame, and graffitist.  In his musical life, his own composition began with the<br/>rejection of the European masters and the traditional concert-hall performance.  The resulting<br/>musical aesthetic is reflective of such influences as Chinese lullabies, Hebrew chants for the<br/>dead, Christian hymns, Congo puberty rites, lumber yards, junk shops, and Boris Godunov.</p><p>Contact<br/>John Gzowski<br/><a href="mailto:Jgzowski@goodmedia.com">Jgzowski@goodmedia.com</a></p><p>critical band gratefully acknowledges the support of the Canada Council for the Arts, The Toronto<br/>Arts Council, The Ontario Arts Coucil and the Laidlaw Foundation</p></div><h3><a id=30031 href="#30031">ðŸ”—</a>Paul Erlich &#x3C;paul@stretch-music.com&#x3E;</h3><span>11/8/2001 1:45:40 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In tuning@y..., &quot;John Gzowski&quot; &lt;jgzowski@g...&gt; wrote:</p><p>&gt; Harry Partch ,Hosaphones and the Chromelodeon</p><p>[...]</p><p>&gt; They will also be adding<br/>&gt; a brass section playing &quot;hoseaphones&quot;  (garden hose natural brass)</p><p>I know a certain list member who became very peeved when (s)he<br/>encountered a hosaphone in my music, and who I expect might be peeved<br/>squared if (s)he knew that hosaphones were going to be used for a<br/>Partch performance.
