Another option is to temper<br/>out 135/128, turning it into 25/16; 32/27 turns into 5/4.

I suggest we use this facet to name it. I think<br/>that it&apos;s very useful in organizing porcupine scales, but also a bit<br/>more than that, because Blacksmith, Pajarous, and Suprapyth both also<br/>support this temperament, and each one has its own way of forming<br/>MODMOS&apos;s to bridge between the temperament&apos;s MOS&apos;s and the &quot;MOS&apos;s&quot; of<br/>this temperament (I assume this means that it forms some killer<br/>decatonic scales, in addition to the 7-note &quot;JI&quot; major scale). These<br/>temperaments contain this one in the same way that 22-equal contains<br/>suprapyth and pajarous.</p><p>For example, the 5-limit JI major scale, tempered in the above<br/>temperament, is a MODMOS of porcupine[7], forming the * . * * . * * .<br/>* . . * set on the lattice - it&apos;s Lssssss b4 #7. This is similar to<br/>how the diatonic scale is a MODMOS of 12EDO[7], which forms the<br/>Halberstadt-shaped * . * . * * . * . * . * set on that lattice.</p><p>I&apos;ve been exploiting the 64/63-tempering of this scale for several<br/>months now, since the V7 chord of this scale is 4:5:6:7. I haven&apos;t<br/>played with 11/8 over the 5/3 yet but I&apos;ll be sure to do that soon.</p><p>-Mike</p></div>
