Tuning a<br/>diatonic instrument is at least an order of magnitude different from<br/>tuning one with 12 notes. Add bray pins to the harp like they did in the<br/>Renaissance, try to imagine the differential equations matters. It&apos;s<br/>impossible to tune a celtic harp so it doesn&apos;t sound pretty. Harpists, in<br/>addition, usually have flowing blonde hair. Just look at the pictorial<br/>record from the renaissance. Just intonation is beside the point.</p><p>Back to dealing with the police department.</p><p>Judy</p></div>
