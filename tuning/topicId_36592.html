Besides the all-star cast and the<br/>inspired playing of most the participants, I&apos;ve always felt this<br/>record had a wonderful X-factor too, and for me that was Miroslav<br/>Vitous&apos; arco.</p><p>Now Vitous&apos; intonation has probably incurred more than a few raised<br/>eyebrows in its time, but if you ask me it&apos;s great--it&apos;s aggressive<br/>and musical if not particularly pitch perfect in the way most<br/>aficionados and aesthetes seem to enjoy.</p><p>I&apos;ve long felt that you should trust your physicality and your<br/>instincts more than you should trust your ear&apos;s tastes when it comes<br/>to making actual music. Music is not tuning. The ear is not your<br/>imagination and if your imagination is its unfortunate indentured<br/>servant, surely that&apos;s a sad thing. Unless you&apos;re good. Real good.</p><p>Vitous&apos; intonation is interesting. Granted interesting isn&apos;t always<br/>good, but uninteresting is a good I&apos;m surely not particularly fond of<br/>either!</p><p>Miroslav&apos;s got good intonation--even if he doesn&apos;t.</p><p>take care,</p><p>--Dan Stearns</p></div><h3>jpehrson2 &#x3C;jpehrson@rcn.com&#x3E;</h3><span>4/23/2002 7:18:03 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In tuning@y..., &quot;D.Stearns&quot; &lt;STEARNS@C...&gt; wrote:</p><p><a href="http://groups.yahoo.com/group/tuning/message/36592">http://groups.yahoo.com/group/tuning/message/36592</a></p><p>&gt; I&apos;ve long felt that you should trust your physicality and your<br/>&gt; instincts more than you should trust your ear&apos;s tastes when it comes<br/>&gt; to making actual music.
