I&apos;ve been<br/>using Werckmeister and Kirnberger tunings lately (the ones built in to the<br/>DX7II), and the really sharp Pythagorean thirds in the distant keys still<br/>bother me. There&apos;s one place in the WTC that&apos;s really unpleasant, with two<br/>octaves between the root and the major third. But I like the effect of the<br/>pure fifths in the distant keys. I never noticed Neidhardt&apos;s tunings<br/>before, but they look pretty good. Neidhardt&apos;s 1724 &quot;Village&quot; / 1732 &quot;Small<br/>City&quot; temperament has tolerable major and minor thirds, and at least s&oacute;me<br/>of the distant keys have pure fifths. So I started playing around with some<br/>tunings, and using a spreadsheet to make diagrams like the ones in<br/>Poletti&apos;s article. Here are a couple that look good (and sound good, as far<br/>as I can tell so far).</p><p>&quot;Arrow I&quot; (named from the shape of the fifth deviations on the chart)</p><p>C-G-D tempered by 3/20 Pythagorean comma<br/>D-A tempered by 1/4 Pyth. comma<br/>A-E-B tempered by 3/20 Pyth. comma<br/>B-F#-C#-G# just<br/>Ab-Eb tempered by 3/20 Pyth. comma<br/>Eb-Bb-F-C just</p><p>The nice thing about this one is that it has lots of just fifths in distant<br/>keys, and two of the major thirds are pretty good (only about 5 cents<br/>sharp). The tempered Ab-Eb in the middle of the just fifths keeps the major<br/>thirds in the distant keys from getting more than 18 cents away from just,<br/>which is more tolerable than the 21.5 cents of Pythagorean major thirds.</p><p>! arrow1.scl<br/>!<br/>&quot;Arrow I&quot; well-temperament<br/> 12<br/>!<br/> 93.75000<br/> 196.87500<br/> 294.14063<br/> 391.40625<br/> 498.04688<br/> 591.79690<br/> 698.43750<br/> 795.70313<br/> 892.96875<br/> 996.09375<br/> 1089.84380<br/> 2/1</p><p>&quot;Arrow II&quot;</p><p>C-G-D tempered by 3/20 Pythagorean comma<br/>D-A tempered by 1/5 Pyth. comma<br/>A-E-B tempered by 3/20 Pyth. comma<br/>B-F# tempered by 1/20 Pyth. comma<br/>F#-C#-G# just<br/>Ab-Eb tempered by 1/10 Pyth. comma<br/>Eb-Bb-F just<br/>F-C tempered by 1/20 Pyth. comma</p><p>This one has a couple of major thirds that are 19 cents sharp, and the best<br/>thirds aren&apos;t as good as Arrow I. But it has a smoother progression of<br/>&quot;good&quot; to &quot;bad&quot; major thirds, and the worst minor thirds aren&apos;t as bad as<br/>Arrow I.</p><p>! arrow2.scl<br/>!<br/>&quot;Arrow II&quot; well-temperament<br/> 12<br/>!<br/> 93.75000<br/> 196.87500<br/> 295.31250<br/> 392.57813<br/> 499.21875<br/> 591.79688<br/> 698.43750<br/> 795.70313<br/> 894.14063<br/> 997.26563<br/> 1091.01560<br/> 2/1</p></div>
