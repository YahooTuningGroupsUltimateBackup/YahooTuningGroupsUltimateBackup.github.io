The sync signal of an old TV works similarly.  There<br/>is a free-running oscillator whose frequency is influenced by a sync signal<br/>being mixed into one of the oscillator signal paths.  This might officially<br/>be a chaotic system, but when sync is achieved, you have the sync signal<br/>being frequency divided.  So this is not done by counting and in that sense<br/>is not really &quot;digital&quot;.  The frequency division ratio is determined by the<br/>relationship between the free-running frequency of the sweep oscillator,<br/>which you can tune using a knob.  If the sweep oscillators free-runing<br/>frequencye is a little more than 3 times the frequency of the sync signal,<br/>then the sweep oscillator will probably increase slightly to fall into sync,<br/>and a frequency division of 3 will probably result.</p><p>I think there have been analog synths that take advantage of such a mode of<br/>operation explicitly.

This might help or might hurt depending on what you are trying<br/>to create.

In virtually<br/>&gt;all dynamical systems which can behave chaotically, there is a<br/>&gt;phenomenon called period-doubling which describes the transition<br/>&gt;from stable, periodic behavior to chaotic behavior. As a relevant<br/>&gt;parameter of the system is increased from a stable to a chaotic<br/>&gt;value, the system repeats itself every 2, 4, 8, 16, . . . periods<br/>&gt;of the stable period. The transitions from one power of two to<br/>&gt;the next occur closer and closer together; the changes in<br/>&gt;parameter values required to produce each successive period<br/>&gt;doubling approach a decreasing geometric sequence with scaling<br/>&gt;parameter equal to the Feigenbaum constant (4.6692016091029 . . .<br/>&gt;). This means that at a finite value of the parameter, the period<br/>&gt;will be infinite, i.e., we have chaos.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;There may be many stages in the hearing process in which non-<br/>&gt;linear dynamics come into play. It would probably be<br/>&gt;counterproductive to allow this non-linearity to be enough to<br/>&gt;lead to chaos, while a parallel structure of processors with<br/>&gt;different, lesser degrees of non-linearity might actually aid in<br/>&gt;the recognition of pitch. It is known that when a (not too high)<br/>&gt;pitch is heard, there are neurons that fire at the same rate as<br/>&gt;the vibration rate of the pitch itself. Other neurons in the<br/>&gt;brain are known to have a non-linear response to their input from<br/>&gt;other neurons. Since a response non-linear enough to lead to<br/>&gt;chaos would essentially be destroying all frequency information,<br/>&gt;most of the neurons would oscillate at the input frequency or at<br/>&gt;octave equivalents below that frequency. Perhaps a certain, low<br/>&gt;octave range is where pitch judgments are actually made. Notice<br/>&gt;how very high tones seem ambiguous in pitch.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;Whether this or the winding of the cochlea explains octave<br/>&gt;equivalence, there may have been evolutionary advantages<br/>&gt;conferred by the ability to reduce unimportant information and<br/>&gt;potential confusion from overtones by compressing pitch<br/>&gt;information to within one octave, which led to the brain or ear<br/>&gt;being designed the way they are.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;As for the apparantly irregular &quot;subharmonic&quot; which Gary observed<br/>&gt;in the bassoon waveform, this can easily be explained by assuming<br/>&gt;some parameter of non-linearity (perhaps lip pressure) was<br/>&gt;hovering around a value at which an initial period doubling<br/>&gt;occurs. So the amplitude of this period-2 subharmonic could have<br/>&gt;been changing, and it could cease to exist for a while, returning<br/>&gt;again just as easily after either an odd or even number of<br/>&gt;period-1 oscillations.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;Here&apos;s an observation about instrument or vocal &quot;subharmonics&quot;:<br/>&gt;Beyond the onset of chaos, chaotic regions alternate (in a<br/>&gt;fractal pattern) with regions whose periods are non-power-of-two<br/>&gt;multiples of the stable period. The last of these subharmonic<br/>&gt;periods to occur, but the broadest in allowed parameter values,<br/>&gt;is period 3. So within a wide enough range of highly chaotic<br/>&gt;parameter values, one is likely to stumble upon period-3<br/>&gt;behavior. Increasing the parameter value further leads to the<br/>&gt;period doublings, which in this case means period-6, period-12,<br/>&gt;period-24, . . . with the same Feigenbaum constant, and back to<br/>&gt;chaos. But decreasing the parameter leads directly back to chaos,<br/>&gt;via a phenomemon known as intermittency, where very nearly<br/>&gt;period-3 behavior persists for stretches of time, unpredictably<br/>&gt;alternating with stretches of chaotic behavior. (The same thing<br/>&gt;is true for every odd number above 3, although the smallest<br/>&gt;parameter value needed to achieve a given odd subharmonic, and<br/>&gt;the range of parameter values in which it persists, are<br/>&gt;decreasing functions of that odd number). Therefore, assuming the<br/>&gt;parameter value varies smoothly with time, and at some times<br/>&gt;takes on values corresponding to simple period-1 vibration, the<br/>&gt;only subharmonics which can exist without chaos ever occuring are<br/>&gt;the subharmonics corresponding to powers of 2. Period-3<br/>&gt;oscillation (or, to a lesser extent, periods of higher odd<br/>&gt;numbers) can be relatively common but cannot smoothly connect<br/>&gt;with simpler behavior.</p><p>&gt;Date: Fri, 8 May 1998 17:34:51 -0400<br/>&gt;From: &quot;Paul H.

Before you were saying<br/>&gt;&gt;that no inharmonicity could possibly occur, which places too<br/>&gt;&gt;much faith in the simplified models.  Ideally, we should develop<br/>&gt;&gt;more complicated models to give a quantitative estimate of the<br/>&gt;&gt;(upper limit of the) inharmonicity.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;I&apos;m not getting equivocal at all. The &quot;simplified models&quot;, as<br/>&gt;Gary observed, seem to handle the vast majority of cases. Dave<br/>&gt;Hill did find specific values for the inharmonicities, which I<br/>&gt;would ascribe to methodological errors, etc. But even if you<br/>&gt;don&apos;t believe me, and take Dave&apos;s values for the inharmonicities,<br/>&gt;they are clearly of a different order of magnitude (typically &lt; 1<br/>&gt;cent) than the departures of the series of resonant frequencies<br/>&gt;from a harmonic series (typically dozens of cents). That&apos;s what<br/>&gt;I&apos;ve been trying to say.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt;Any noise in the input will cause peaks at the resonant modes.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;They are not really &quot;peaks&quot; so much as &quot;hills&quot; since there are no<br/>&gt;constructively interfering standing waves to sharpen them. While<br/>&gt;the noise energy will be spread throughout the spectrum, the<br/>&gt;energy from the driver (reed, lips, bow) will manifest in Dirac-<br/>&gt;delta-function-like peaks at harmonic overtones in the spectrum.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt;Inharmonicity will cause problems with JI whether or not it&apos;s<br/>&gt;&gt;systematic. Any noise in the input will cause peaks at the<br/>&gt;&gt;resonant modes.  The result will be inharmonicity.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;Listen, Gary and I have been defining systematic inharmonicity as<br/>&gt;cases where, after the noise is removed, the partials deviate<br/>&gt;from a harmonic series. Since noise doesn&apos;t exhibit interference<br/>&gt;effects, the only inharmonicity relevant to JI is systematic<br/>&gt;inharmonicity.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt;If the overtones are not centered at the resonant peaks, the<br/>&gt;&gt;amplitude of each overtone on output will depend on it&apos;s pitch.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;Good point. I don&apos;t know about the rest, but you said it isn&apos;t<br/>&gt;important, so . . .<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt;Examples of recorded resonances were given for a range of wind<br/>&gt;&gt;instruments, and they&apos;re all significantly off from the integer<br/>&gt;&gt;ratios.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;Yes indeed!<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt;The resonances of flutes were also given relative to 12-equal.<br/>&gt;&gt;They were up to 20 cents out!  It&apos;s only the flautist&apos;s skill<br/>&gt;&gt;that adjusts them to the desired scale.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;The standard fingerings take this into account, in case you<br/>&gt;didn&apos;t know that already. So, if knowing the standard fingerings<br/>&gt;is considered part of &quot;skill&quot;, then you are right.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt;Yes, chaos would be counterproductive.  There are plenty of<br/>&gt;&gt;nonlinear equations that produce stable subharmonics without<br/>&gt;&gt;being chaotic, though. These would probably be more efficient<br/>&gt;&gt;than one that could suddenly lapse into chaotic behaviour.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt;Jordan &amp; Smith give the following example of a stable order 1/3<br/>&gt;&gt;subharmonic:<br/>&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt;x&apos;&apos; + x - x^3 / 6 = 1.5*cos(2.85*t)<br/>&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt;Where the &apos;&apos; means differentiate twice with respect to t.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;While most physical nonlinearities are characterized by a<br/>&gt;quadratic fixed point, this appears to be one with a zero-slope<br/>&gt;cubic nonlinearity (inflection point). Instead of a period-<br/>&gt;doubling cascade, changes in the parameter value for this type of<br/>&gt;system lead to a Fibonacci sequence of period lengths. So<br/>&gt;changing the parameter in this case could decrease the period to<br/>&gt;2 or increase it to 5. I don&apos;t see how this is more &quot;stable&quot; that<br/>&gt;a typical order 1/n^2 subharmonic for a quadratic-fixed-point<br/>&gt;nonlinearity.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt;It is known that when a (not too high) pitch is heard,<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt;there are neurons that fire at the same rate as the vibration<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt;rate of the pitch itself.<br/>&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt;Your theory suggests that neurons should fire at a 1/2^n<br/>&gt;&gt;subharmonic of higher pitches.  Has this been observed?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;I don&apos;t know, but this would be at a higher processing level than<br/>&gt;the neurons forming the auditory nerve, which is what is<br/>&gt;typically probed. In any case, Gary was asking for a mechanism by<br/>&gt;which powers of two would be distinguished from powers of any<br/>&gt;other number. Chaos theory presents a very clear reason to think<br/>&gt;that such distinctions are often made in nature.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt; Other neurons in the brain are known to have a non-linear<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt;response to their input from other neurons. Since a response<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt;non-linear enough to lead to chaos would essentially be<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt;destroying all frequency information, most of the neurons<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt;would oscillate at the input frequency or at octave equivalents<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt;below that frequency. Perhaps a certain, low octave range is<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt;where pitch judgments are actually made. Notice how very high<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt;tones seem ambiguous in pitch.<br/>&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt;I would question whether neurons can react at such high<br/>&gt;&gt;frequencies at all.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;What are &quot;such high frequencies&quot;? I did say &quot;not too high&quot; above!<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt;I don&apos;t have experimental data to hand, but I remember evidence<br/>&gt;&gt;that low frequencies are perceived in a different way to high<br/>&gt;&gt;ones, probably because of this.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;The actual frequency at which periodicity pitch gives up is about<br/>&gt;5-6 kHz. Really high!<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt;The latest book&apos;s I&apos;ve read --&gt;which, as they came from<br/>&gt;&gt;libraries, are a decade or three old -- say that the original<br/>&gt;&gt;experiments showing octave invariance were performed on<br/>&gt;&gt;musically literate subjects.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;Are white rats musically literate?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt;More specifically, literate in Western Classical Music, where<br/>&gt;&gt;the notation is octave based.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;Many other cultures use octave-based notation.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt;As for the apparantly irregular &quot;subharmonic&quot; which Gary<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt;observed in the bassoon waveform, this can easily be explained<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt;by assuming some parameter of non-linearity (perhaps lip<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt;pressure) was hovering around a value at which an initial<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt;period doubling occurs. So the amplitude of this period-2<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt;subharmonic could have been changing, and it could cease to<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt;exist for a while, returning again just as easily after either<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt;an odd or even number of period-1 oscillations.<br/>&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt;This assumes the system is teetering in a bifurcation point,<br/>&gt;&gt;which is actually very unlikely.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;Not unlikely at all! Look again at a bifurcation diagram -- there<br/>&gt;is quite a large range of values where the period-2 behavior has<br/>&gt;a relatively constant amplitude, but at one end of this range the<br/>&gt;amplitude suddenly decreases and period-1 behavior ensues. If the<br/>&gt;bassoonist is trying to keep within this range, say because he is<br/>&gt;trying to play as loud as he can and octave subharmonics don&apos;t<br/>&gt;bother him but chaos does, the parameter will likely take on just<br/>&gt;such a range of values.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt;I&apos;d guess the amplitude of the subharmonic is chaotic.  Or, the<br/>&gt;&gt;subharmonic is entirely chaotic but appears to be order 1/2 at<br/>&gt;&gt;certain times<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt;A period doubling cascade can be linked to amplitude, though.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;These don&apos;t sound like examples of real-world dynamics.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt;It&apos;s unlikely that a period 3 cascade could be picked out from a<br/>&gt;&gt;chaotic region with one parameter.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;Not unlikely at all, I&apos;ve done it with my vocal cords.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt;In the Mandelbrot set, though, there is a fairly large period 3<br/>&gt;&gt;region.  Similar things might occur with differential equations<br/>&gt;&gt;of 2 parameters for all I&apos;d know.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;Actually, a differential equation needs to have at least 3<br/>&gt;parameters for chaos to occur. However, the picture along<br/>&gt;whichever of the parameters is responsible for chaos will be the<br/>&gt;good old bifurcation diagram. The Mandelbrot set represents a<br/>&gt;discrete (not continuous) dynamical system, which only needs one<br/>&gt;parameter to exhibit chaos. If you restrict yourself to the real<br/>&gt;line, you see the usual bifurcation diagram again (proceeding<br/>&gt;from right to left).<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt;I think there might even be a period 3, 9, 27, ... cascade in<br/>&gt;&gt;the Mandelbrot set.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;Naah, the Mandelbrot set is clearly all about period doubling;<br/>&gt;the iteration of a point on the set&apos;s boundary doubles the angle<br/>&gt;the point makes on the unit circle (to which the boundary can be<br/>&gt;conformally mapped). Although you could probably find some<br/>&gt;contorted path in the complex plane to support your guess.</p><p>&gt;Date: Sat, 9 May 1998 14:56 +0100 (BST)<br/>&gt;From: <a href="mailto:gbreed@cix.compulink.co.uk">gbreed@cix.compulink.co.uk</a> (Graham Breed)<br/>&gt;To: <a href="mailto:tuning@eartha.mills.edu">tuning@eartha.mills.edu</a><br/>&gt;Subject: More on instrument aperiodicity<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;Paul Erlich wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt;I&apos;m not getting equivocal at all.

That&apos;s what I&apos;ve been trying to say.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;Hang on.  In TD 1392, Gary Morrison started the discussion with:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt;Another consideration that deserves some thought along these lines<br/>&gt;&gt;is that very few acoustic instruments have their overtones within 1<br/>&gt;&gt;cent of exact harmonics.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;Then you said<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt;Last time we had this discussion, we agreed (I thought) that bowed<br/>&gt;&gt;strings, winds, and brass instruments had exact integer harmonics for<br/>&gt;&gt;as long as they sustain a consistent tone. That is a physical fact,<br/>&gt;&gt;true of any system with a 1-component driver, which oscillates<br/>&gt;&gt;periodically and<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;Firstly, I took &quot;exact&quot; to mean an integer to an infinite number of<br/>&gt;decimal places.  &quot;How can anyone assert such accuracy?&quot;  I thought.<br/>&gt;Also, the implication is obviously of far _higher_ accuracy than the &lt;1<br/>&gt;cent previously suggested.  I also queried how you could be so sure that<br/>&gt;a reed or whatever is exactly a 1-component driver, but Gary made the<br/>&gt;point for me.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;You replied with a model for the operation of reeds/lips that assumed<br/>&gt;laminar airflow, and concluded with:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt;Hence the amplitude of the partials can vary, sometimes wildly,<br/>&gt;&gt;rendering the waveform aperiodic. However, for the time domains<br/>&gt;&gt;relevant for the ear&apos;s analysis, this does not lead to any relevant<br/>&gt;&gt;alterations in the frequencies of the partials.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;So, you&apos;re presumably still with exact integer ratios.  Maybe, though,<br/>&gt;you mean that pitch fluctuations place a lower limit on the pitch<br/>&gt;precision that is meaningful, and that inharmonicity is below this<br/>&gt;threshold.  It isn&apos;t clear.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;I presumed, with all the uncertainties in the construction of the reed,<br/>&gt;that resonance with the air column was the main factor governing<br/>&gt;inharmonicity, and was corrected on that point.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;If you&apos;re now saying that inharmonicities of a fraction of a cent are<br/>&gt;not physically impossible, I&apos;m happy to concur with that.  My guess<br/>&gt;would be less than 0.1 cents, although I have no proof of that, and<br/>&gt;would like some.  Hopefully, we can stop theorising and wait for some<br/>&gt;more data.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;This is interesting, though:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt;Any noise in the input will cause peaks at the resonant modes.<br/>&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt;They are not really &quot;peaks&quot; so much as &quot;hills&quot; since there are no<br/>&gt;&gt;constructively interfering standing waves to sharpen them. While the<br/>&gt;&gt;noise energy will be spread throughout the spectrum, the energy from<br/>&gt;&gt;the driver (reed, lips, bow) will manifest in<br/>&gt;&gt;Dirac-delta-function-like peaks at harmonic overtones in the<br/>&gt;&gt;spectrum.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;Why couldn&apos;t they be reinforced by standing waves?  If the noise<br/>&gt;provides a constant impulse at all frequencies, that should lead to<br/>&gt;peaks at the resonances like with a flute, maybe still corrected by an<br/>&gt;order of magnitude towards harmonicity.  Whether this means two peaks<br/>&gt;occur close together, or the original peak is shifted slightly, I don&apos;t<br/>&gt;know.  Definitely smaller than the 0.1 cents for most instruments,<br/>&gt;though, because of the low noise level.  Maybe not even the only source<br/>&gt;of inharmonicity, but the easiest one to quantify.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;I&apos;m not deliberately causing trouble here, only I usually agree with you<br/>&gt;and it distresses me when I don&apos;t.  Hopefully, this was just a problem<br/>&gt;of expression, and we can put it all behind us, marching defiantly<br/>&gt;towards a better future.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt;Listen, Gary and I have been defining systematic inharmonicity as<br/>&gt;&gt;cases where, after the noise is removed, the partials deviate from a<br/>&gt;&gt;harmonic series. Since noise doesn&apos;t exhibit interference effects, the<br/>&gt;&gt;only inharmonicity relevant to JI is systematic inharmonicity.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;I can&apos;t find this definition anywhere.  I was assuming &quot;systematic&quot;<br/>&gt;meant the deviation from integers had to be constant from one cycle to<br/>&gt;the next.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt;The resonances of flutes were also given relative to 12-equal.  They<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt;were up to 20 cents out!  It&apos;s only the flautist&apos;s skill that adjusts<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt;them to the desired scale.<br/>&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt;The standard fingerings take this into account, in case you didn&apos;t know<br/>&gt;&gt;that already. So, if knowing the standard fingerings is considered part<br/>&gt;&gt;of &quot;skill&quot;, then you are right.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;I can&apos;t go back and check now, but I think both cases were covered.<br/>&gt;Harmonics played by the performer were out by less than however else<br/>&gt;they were measured.  There is still a deviation with the usual<br/>&gt;fingerings, though, of quite a few cents.  Enough to scupper the<br/>&gt;difference between 12-equal and meantone.  Instrument manufacture may<br/>&gt;have improved since then, of course.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;The inharmonicity in the resonances is caused by the holes being there,<br/>&gt;and there&apos;s some complex relationship between this and the holes<br/>&gt;producing slightly the wrong pitches.  I didn&apos;t read it for long enough<br/>&gt;to be sure. I usually ignore acoustic instruments, but thought I&apos;d<br/>&gt;better clue up for this discussion.</p><p>&gt;Date: Sat, 9 May 1998 14:56 +0100 (BST)<br/>&gt;From: <a href="mailto:gbreed@cix.compulink.co.uk">gbreed@cix.compulink.co.uk</a> (Graham Breed)<br/>&gt;To: <a href="mailto:tuning@eartha.mills.edu">tuning@eartha.mills.edu</a><br/>&gt;Subject: More chaotic stuff<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;Ah yes, more on chaos theory shoehorned into a musical discussion.<br/>&gt;Musicians can still be reassured that they don&apos;t need to know this<br/>&gt;stuff.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;Paul Erlich wrote on the version of Duffing&apos;s equation I posted:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt;While most physical nonlinearities are characterized by a quadratic<br/>&gt;&gt;fixed point, this appears to be one with a zero-slope cubic<br/>&gt;&gt;nonlinearity (inflection point).<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;&quot;Most physical nonlinearities&quot; is something of a generalisation.  I<br/>&gt;thought Duffing&apos;s equation is pretty much a classic for forced<br/>&gt;oscillations, but maybe only in pure mathematics.  I never did any chaos<br/>&gt;theory in physics.  Not important here, as I assume we&apos;re still thinking<br/>&gt;of an artificial process in the brain.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt;Instead of a period-doubling cascade, changes in the<br/>&gt;&gt;parameter value for this type of system lead to a Fibonacci sequence of<br/>&gt;&gt;period lengths. So changing the parameter in this case could decrease<br/>&gt;&gt;the period to 2 or increase it to 5. I don&apos;t see how this is more<br/>&gt;&gt;&quot;stable&quot; that a typical order 1/n^2 subharmonic for a<br/>&gt;&gt;quadratic-fixed-point nonlinearity.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;I meant &quot;stable&quot; in the usual sense that, of you perturb the system<br/>&gt;slightly, it will not tend towards an entirely different behaviour.<br/>&gt;This is the minimum criterion for a limit cycle to be at all useful.<br/>&gt;There are, in fact, four centres and three (unstable) saddles.  Centres<br/>&gt;are stable, but not asymptotically stable, and this is usually how limit<br/>&gt;cycles arise, although I don&apos;t know if that&apos;s relevant in this case.<br/>&gt;Slight damping means the centres become stable spirals, and their basins<br/>&gt;of attraction are much reduced.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;Here&apos;s some text:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;&quot;For the linear equation this[not the system above] periodic motion<br/>&gt;appears to be merely an anomalous case of the usual almost-periodic<br/>&gt;motion, depending on a precise relation between the forcing and natural<br/>&gt;frequencies.  Also, any damping will cause its disappearance.  When the<br/>&gt;equation is nonlinear, however, the generation of alien harmonics by the<br/>&gt;nonlinear terms may cause a stable subharmonic to appear for a range of<br/>&gt;the parameters, and in particular for a range of applied frequencies.<br/>&gt;Also, the forcing amplitude plays a part in generating and sustaining<br/>&gt;the subharmonic even in the presence of damping.  Thus there will exist<br/>&gt;the tolerance of slightly varying conditions necessary for the<br/>&gt;consistent appearance of a subharmonic and its use in physical systems.&quot;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;D.W.Jordan &amp; P. Smith &quot;Nonlinear Ordinary Differential Equations&quot; 2nd<br/>&gt;edition, Oxford, 1987, p.196.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;The following general case (Duffing&apos;s equation without damping) is then<br/>&gt;covered:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;                  x&apos;&apos; + a*x + b*x^3 = G*cos(w*t)<br/>&gt;                  w^2*x&apos;&apos; + a*x + b*x^3 = G*cos(tau)<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;In the first equation, differentiation is with respect to t, in the<br/>&gt;second wrt to tau.  The two are equivalent, and the second is used as<br/>&gt;the frequency is not known before the parameters are chosen.  There&apos;s a<br/>&gt;lengthy calculation, that I haven&apos;t followed, the result being (p.200):<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;                 a =~ w^2/9<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;As &quot;the calculations are valid without the restriction on b.&quot;  I think b<br/>&gt;should still be small, though.  It looks like this is a good way of<br/>&gt;generating a subharmonic of a particular value, if that&apos;s what you want<br/>&gt;to do.  Not all of these subharmonics are stable, though, so I quoted<br/>&gt;one that is proved such as an example in the next section.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;Whatever mechanism, some kind of nonlinear equation seems to be the way<br/>&gt;to perform frequency reduction.  The most useful subharmonic will still<br/>&gt;be of order 1/2, but that is not inevitable.  According to the text,<br/>&gt;this sort of thing goes on in quartz clocks.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt;The actual frequency at which periodicity pitch gives up is<br/>&gt;&gt;about 5-6 kHz. Really high!<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;Yes, this is higher than I thought.  I was expecting a few hundred Hz.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt;The latest book&apos;s I&apos;ve read -- which, as they came from libraries,<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt;are a decade or three old -- say that the original experiments showing<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt;octave invariance were performed on musically literate subjects.<br/>&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt;Are white rats musically literate?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;No, obviously not.  I&apos;d still prefer humans, but please outline any<br/>&gt;experiments you know of.  Not having access to a university library,<br/>&gt;I can&apos;t get hold of academic papers very easily.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt;More specifically, literate in Western<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt;Classical Music, where the notation is octave based.<br/>&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt;Many other cultures use octave-based notation.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;Whoa!  Hold on there!  When did I say anything else?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;As for the apparantly irregular &quot;subharmonic&quot; which Gary observed<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;in the bassoon waveform, this can easily be explained by assuming<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;some parameter of non-linearity (perhaps lip pressure) was hovering<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;around a value at which an initial period doubling occurs. So the<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;amplitude of this period-2 subharmonic could have been changing,<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;and it could cease to exist for a while, returning again just as<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;easily after either an odd or even number of period-1 oscillations.<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt;This assumes the system is teetering in a bifurcation point, which is<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt;actually very unlikely.<br/>&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt;Not unlikely at all! Look again at a bifurcation diagram -- there is<br/>&gt;&gt;quite a large range of values where the period-2 behavior has a<br/>&gt;&gt;relatively constant amplitude, but at one end of this range the<br/>&gt;&gt;amplitude suddenly decreases and period-1 behavior ensues. If the<br/>&gt;&gt;bassoonist is trying to keep within this range, say because he is<br/>&gt;&gt;trying to play as loud as he can and octave subharmonics don&apos;t bother<br/>&gt;&gt;him but chaos does, the parameter will likely take on just such a<br/>&gt;&gt;range of values.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;If there&apos;s some reason to move toward a bifurcation, that would make a<br/>&gt;difference.  If &quot;the period-2 behaviour has a relatively constant<br/>&gt;amplitude&quot; why not play right in the middle of the period 2 region,<br/>&gt;instead of veering toward the bifurcation?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt;I&apos;d guess the amplitude of the subharmonic is chaotic.  Or, the<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt;subharmonic is entirely chaotic but appears to be order 1/2 at<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt;certain times<br/>&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt;A period doubling cascade can be<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt;linked to amplitude, though.<br/>&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt;These don&apos;t sound like examples of real-world dynamics.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;On thinking about it, the chaotic subharmonic is unlikely.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;It&apos;s obvious I&apos;m relying on one book, but anyway ... The example is for<br/>&gt;Duffing&apos;s equation again:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;                 x&apos;&apos; + k*x&apos; + x^3 = G*cos(w*t)<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;The bifurcation parameter is G (really Gamma) which is the forcing<br/>&gt;amplitude.  A period doubling cascade is demonstrated (pp336-345).<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt;It&apos;s unlikely that a period 3 cascade could be picked out from a<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt;chaotic region with one parameter.<br/>&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt;Not unlikely at all, I&apos;ve done it with my vocal cords.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;Well done!  How did you perform this experiment?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt;In the Mandelbrot set, though, there is a fairly large period 3<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt;region.  Similar things might occur with differential equations<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt;of 2 parameters for all I&apos;d know.<br/>&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt;Actually, a differential equation needs to have at least 3 parameters<br/>&gt;&gt;for chaos to occur. However, the picture along whichever of the<br/>&gt;&gt;parameters is responsible for chaos will be the good old bifurcation<br/>&gt;&gt;diagram. The Mandelbrot set represents a discrete (not continuous)<br/>&gt;&gt;dynamical system, which only needs one parameter to exhibit chaos. If<br/>&gt;&gt;you restrict yourself to the real line, you see the usual bifurcation<br/>&gt;&gt;diagram again (proceeding from right to left).<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;I meant that the bifurcation parameter becomes a plane, like the<br/>&gt;Mandelbrot set, rather than that the system has two variables.  I can<br/>&gt;see that isn&apos;t clear.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;Minor correction: that should be &quot;an autonomous differential<br/>&gt;equation...&quot;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt;I think there might even be a period 3, 9, 27, ... cascade in the<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt;Mandelbrot set.<br/>&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt;Naah, the Mandelbrot set is clearly all about period doubling; the<br/>&gt;&gt;iteration of a point on the set&apos;s boundary doubles the angle the point<br/>&gt;&gt;makes on the unit circle (to which the boundary can be conformally<br/>&gt;&gt;mapped). Although you could probably find some contorted path in the<br/>&gt;&gt;complex plane to support your guess.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;You bet!  The way I would implement twelfth-reduction, though, is to<br/>&gt;use a 1/3 order subharmonic generator, and repeat the process until<br/>&gt;the frequency became suitably low.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;Incidentally, Benoit Mandelbrot is a Polish mathematician, with some<br/>&gt;links with France, working in the USA.
