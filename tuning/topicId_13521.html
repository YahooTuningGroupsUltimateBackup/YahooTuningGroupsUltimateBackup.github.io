Schulter &#x3C;MSCHULTER@VALUE.NET&#x3E;</h3><span>9/25/2000 7:14:00 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Hello, there, and thanks to Monz for a couple of comments about my<br/>higher-prime neo-Gothic JI tuning for which he&apos;s now designed two<br/>beautiful lattices -- the new ASCII-based version which I can view in<br/>real time with the Lynx browser, as well as the most impressive<br/>graphical version.</p><p>&gt; One is the bridge spanning one exponent each of prime-factors 7 and<br/>&gt; 11, separating 14/11 (= ~418 cents) and 81/64 (== [3^4] = ~408<br/>&gt; cents).  This has the ratio 896/891, which is [3^-4 * 7^1 * 11^-1]<br/>&gt; in prime-factor notation, and is ~9.688 cents.</p><p>An interesting question is what to call this ratio of 896:891, the<br/>difference between the usual Pythagorean or 3-limit major third at<br/>81:64 (four 3:2 fifths up), and a 14:11. It&apos;s also the difference<br/>between the usual Pythagorean minor third at 32:27 and 33:28, the<br/>interval which together with 14:11 makes up a pure 3:2 fifth.</p><p>One possible name is the &quot;undecimal syntonic comma,&quot; although I&apos;m not<br/>sure how descriptive (or confusing) this might be. Anyway, the 896:891<br/>seems a &quot;kinder and gentler&quot; divergence than the syntonic comma at<br/>81:80 (~21.506 cents) or the Pythagorean comma at 531441:524288<br/>(~23.460 cents).</p><p>Melodically, it may involve less &quot;stress&quot; (maybe a gentler term than<br/>&quot;pain&quot;); vertically, at a tad less than 10 cents, it makes a fifth<br/>quite &quot;beatful,&quot; but not an outright Wolf -- people maybe tending to<br/>draw the line here at around 10-12 cents.</p><p>Of course, in a neo-Gothic style where this tuning would be<br/>appropriate, we&apos;re likely looking for even more active thirds (and<br/>sixths) than Pythagorean, and also can &quot;fall back&quot; on standard<br/>Pythagorean without any problem.</p><p>Thus the situation is more forgiving than in a 5-limit JI system, for<br/>example, where an 81:64 where a 5:4 was intended would be a<br/>&quot;mistuning&quot; or &quot;near-Wolf. An 81:64 in place of a 14:11 is a<br/>&quot;variation of color,&quot; and the 12-note tuning takes advantage of this<br/>by using regular Pythagerean thirds and sixths (e.g. Bb-D, Bb-G) at<br/>the flat end of the chain to make things a bit simpler.</p><p>This comparison of the 896:891 to the syntonic and Pythagorean commas<br/>brings us to Monz&apos;s next point, or &quot;bridge.&quot;</p><p>&gt; The other is the bridge spanning two exponents each of prime-factors<br/>&gt; 7 and 11, separating 12544:9801 (== [3^-4 * 7^2 * 11^-2] = ~427<br/>&gt; cents) and 3^16 (= ~431 cents, and a ratio with numbers too large<br/>&gt; for me to bother with).  This bridge is [3^20* 7^-2 * 11^2] in<br/>&gt; prime-factor notation, and is ~4.084 cents.</p><p>This is a comparison which didn&apos;t occur to me, but is a very<br/>interesting angle once pointed out. Here&apos;s how I might explain it.</p><p>The 12544:9801 is equal to a Pythagorean major third enlarged by _two_<br/>of those 896:891 commas we&apos;ve been discussing, or 802816:793881,<br/>~19.376 cents, giving us a size of ~427.195 cents.</p><p>The Pythagorean interval of 16 fifths up (e.g. Gb-A#), much favored as<br/>a wide major third in Xeno-Gothic music with a 24-note Pythagorean<br/>tuning, is equal to a Pythagorean major third enlarged by one<br/>Pythagorean comma, or ~23.460 cents, giving us a size of ~431.280<br/>cents.</p><p>Thus what we&apos;re comparing here is the size of two 896:891 commas at<br/>around 9.7 cents each versus one Pythagorean comma at around 23.5<br/>cents; the Pythagorean comma is slightly larger, a difference more<br/>precisely of ~4.084 cents.</p><p>This 4-cent schisma, or whatever, has the somewhat imposing integer<br/>ratio of 421900912521:420906795008, equal to the Pythagorean comma of<br/>531441:524288 divided by (896:891)^2 or 802816:793881.</p><p>Thanking Monz for calling my attention to this comparison, I might add<br/>that I still need to write more about the musical uses of this tuning.</p><p>For now, I might just offer a general caution: in typical JI schemes,<br/>one of the goals is to &quot;maximize consonance&quot; or &quot;minimize dissonance&quot;<br/>of intervals across various limits.</p><p>Here, however, in a neo-Gothic setting with a 3-limit of stability,<br/>what we&apos;re doing by trying out different sizes of unstable major<br/>thirds (e.g. 81:64, 14:11, 12544:9801) is mainly going for some<br/>contrast and variety. Note that fifths or fourths impure by around 9.7<br/>cents can have a pleasant cadential effect, adding another flavor of<br/>tension building our anticipation of the resolution.</p><p>Most appreciatively,</p><p>Margo Schulter<br/><a href="mailto:mschulter@value.net">mschulter@value.net</a></p></div>
