Only the latter<br/>intervals, however, are treated as stable concords; the others are<br/>unstable, and in 16th-century terms more specifically &quot;dissonances&quot;<br/>subject to rather cautious restraints.</p><p>If you were to say simply &quot;5-limit,&quot; I would take it to mean the whole<br/>system of intervals, concordant (5-odd-limit) or otherwise. For some<br/>people, &quot;5-limit&quot; can imply &quot;5-odd-limit,&quot; in other words &quot;5-limit<br/>concords only,&quot; but I would call this a difference in usage, not an error<br/>on your part (as it happens, I favor your usage).</p><p>&gt; in lattice terms, i thought 3-limit referred to the entire dimension of<br/>&gt; ratios that can be made by taking powers of 3; and 5-limit, the whole<br/>&gt; 2-dimensional lattice made by taking powers of 3 and 5.</p><p>Apart from the question of whether we also count the octave (2:1) as a<br/>dimension -- and doing so seems to be a minority view (e.g. Carter Scholz)<br/>-- I would very much agree with this statement, not only mathematically<br/>but musically. One of the problems I have as a Pythagorean tuning advocate<br/>with the approach that takes &quot;odd-limit&quot; as the default meaning of limit<br/>as that it maybe tends to filter all the neat _large_-integer ratios that<br/>a 3-limit system can come up with.</p><p>Maybe rather than debating who is &quot;right&quot; or &quot;wrong,&quot; it might be<br/>interesting to see what musical or cultural perspectives might lead people<br/>to prefer one default usage or the other. When in doubt, explicitly saying<br/>&quot;5-odd-limit&quot; or &quot;5-prime-limit&quot; solves any question of ambiguity.</p><p>Most respectfully,</p><p>Margo Schulter<br/><a href="mailto:mschulter@value.net">mschulter@value.net</a></p></div>
