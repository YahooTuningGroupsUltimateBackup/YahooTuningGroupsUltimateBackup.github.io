That&apos;s exactly the type of thing I&apos;m bringing into question. Just to add to what you already said so clearly, mathematically speaking there seems to be an infinite amount of rational numbers which in principle approximate the tempered intervals. Given 2 power of n/12, n = 0, 1, 2,...12, then taking 2 power of (N + n/12), N = whole, rounding off to nearest odd (if available), and dividing by 2 power of N seems to supply us with an inexhaustible set. Further, the larger N the more digits we include after the decimal point and the smaller the difference between the two irrational and rational numbers. So that if N approaches infinity, then theoretically speaking at least the two numbers might become exact. (But since the resultant period is infinitely large in comparison to the component periods, then this is tantamount to saying that no period exists after all).</p><p>However, nature might step in here and provide some realistic limit to N.  This might be Planck&apos;s constant, or it might be limitations in computational process, or our hearing etc...</p><p>But what is of most importance to me in this question (and is not lost on Mike) is the possibility that all waves are periodic and that it is the irrationals which are the approximation. Tom, you said something to the effect that sine waves are simplistic idealizations and therefore could see no reason why we should be discussing such matters in this forum. But isn&apos;t it true that all Fourier transforms are built of component sine waves, which applies to both optics and QM? In fact what interested me in wave theory to begin with was when I saw how well wave addition modelled musical tonality. When the wave is periodic, the tonic is simply octave equivalent to the resultant fundamental frequency (not only is 6/5 a worse approximation to the minor third than 19/16, the 5 in the denominator gives the wrong tonic, whereas 16 gives the fifth octave. We need this in order to be in a minor key. Thanks everybody for confirming this for me). So if all waves are<br/> harmonic and periodic to the very core, and these waves are a fixture of nature and by definition can be described by Fourier analysis, then the distinction between science and music is not as clear cut as we have been led to believe. If this is correct, then Pythagoras was right after all, but in a new way. In fact, it&apos;s my view that it is the sine wave that is real and observable, not the geometrical lines that physicists draw on a page and call &apos;space and time&apos;, nor the rods and clocks that these are meant to represent and which they had to invent in order to compensate for this observational deficiency. As I said in the last email, this question of tuning reaches right to the very heart of Western culture with Pythagoras. Harmonia means the fitting of things together and is the root of our concept of cosmos and universal order i.e. science itself. Fact is stranger than science-fiction and waves are more interesting than any dreams about time travel.</p><p>Regards</p><p>Rick</p><p>      Get the name you always wanted with the new y7mail email address.<br/><a href="http://www.yahoo7.com.au/mail">www.yahoo7.com.au/mail</a></p></div><h3>hstraub64 &#x3C;straub@...&#x3E;</h3><span>6/2/2008 1:47:40 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, rick ballan &lt;rick_ballan@...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Thanks Mike.

Try not to think of an infinity that has &quot;an equal<br/>number of everything&quot; in it.  Try to think of just a reasonable number<br/>of two kinds of things and expand it later.   The point is that by<br/>definition there are fewer numbers that are rational than there are<br/>irrational numbers: because the definition of irrational numbers ALLOWS<br/>more numbers to qualify.  Don&apos;t worry about infinities yet. Just<br/>consider, as in my previous email, how many rational numbers you can<br/>CONCEPTUALLY put in the interval 0 to 1 and compare that to the number<br/>of irrational numbers you can also assign to that interval.   No matter<br/>how many rational numbers you put in, you can BY DEFINITION put in more<br/>irrational numbers, no matter how you calculate them!  Still, don&apos;t<br/>worry about counting them yet. Now, consider what you have found--you<br/>can always put in more irrational numbers than rational numbers, even<br/>between 0 and 1.  No matter how many rational numbers you put in, there<br/>is ALWAYS room for more irrational numbers between them.  Start with<br/>just a few rationals: you can insert as many irrationals as you have<br/>time for between them.  That&apos;s the point.  It&apos;s true you can always put<br/>in more rationals--and you can always put in EVEN MORE irrationals.<br/>This is why infinity is not just an uncountable number of things; there<br/>are properties associated with the kinds of things being counted.</p><p>It&apos;s just that in an infinite number of arbitrary numbers there will be<br/>more irrationals because there will always be fewer rationals, based on<br/>how they are defined.</p><p>See <a href="http://mathforum.org/isaac/problems/cantor1.html">mathforum.org/isaac/problems/cantor1.html</a> for Cantor&apos;s attempt to<br/>make infinity less paradoxical.

If the two sets have that property - anything in one set &gt; can be matched by something in the other - then they are of the same &gt; cardinality.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Take the set of natural numbers: it goes on forever in one &gt; direction. How about the set of just the positive even numbers?

This is &gt; again because they can be put into that one-to-one correspondence I &gt; keep taling about.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; How about the set of all integers? After all, it goes on forever in &gt; two directions: negatively and positively. Maybe we&apos;ll reach some &gt; &quot;bigger&quot; infinity in that way.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; If we take all of the negative numbers and pair them with the odd &gt; numbers...<br/>&gt; Integers: -1 -2 -3 ...<br/>&gt; Naturals:  1  3  5 ...<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; and the positive numbers and pair them with the even numbers...<br/>&gt; Integers: 1 2 3 ...<br/>&gt; Naturals: 2 4 6 ...<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Then we get this:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Integers: 0 -1  1 -2  2 -3  3 ...<br/>&gt; Naturals: 0  1  2  3  4  5  6 ...<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; You see that the two sets can be matched up that way. The integers &gt; can be expressed as a list of numbers increasing forever in one &gt; direction. There is that one to one correspondence. There is a &gt; &quot;bijection&quot; between the two sets. Therefore they are of the same &gt; degree of infinity - they have the same cardinality.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; What about the set of all rational numbers? Those might be of a &gt; greater degree of infinity than the natural numbers and the integers.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Any rational number can be expressed as an integer fraction. This &gt; means we can graph set of all rational numbers can be as a plane -- &gt; the horizontal axis would represent an increase in the denominator &gt; and the vertical axis would represent an increase in the numerator. &gt; So is the degree of infinity of a plane more than that of a line?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; For a long, long time, mathematicians thought the answer was &quot;yes.&quot; &gt; And then someone came up with a pattern so obvious that it was &gt; almost stupid: If you just draw diagonal lines going from (0,1) to &gt; (1,0), and then from (0,2) to (2,0), and etc, you hit everything. So &gt; you can list all of the numbers and pair them up with the natural &gt; numbers.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Well, if you look at it this way:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;  1: 1/1<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;  2: 1/2<br/>&gt;  3: 2/1<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;  4: 1/3<br/>&gt;  5: 2/2<br/>&gt;  6: 3/1<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;  7: 1/4<br/>&gt;  8: 2/3<br/>&gt;  9: 3/2<br/>&gt; 10: 4/1<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; etc.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Then every positive rational number in existence will be reached - &gt; some multiple times (which is okay). To include the negative &gt; rationals as well:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;  1:  1/1<br/>&gt;  2: -1/1<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;  3:  1/2<br/>&gt;  4: -1/2<br/>&gt;  5:  2/1<br/>&gt;  6: -2/1<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;  7:  1/3<br/>&gt;  8: -1/3<br/>&gt;  9:  2/2<br/>&gt; 10: -2/2<br/>&gt; 11:  3/1<br/>&gt; 12: -3/1<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; etc.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; So we can pair up all of the rational numbers with the natural &gt; numbers. A bijection exists between the two sets, they are of the &gt; same degree of infinity, etc.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Another way to say this is that the set of all rational numbers, &gt; natural numbers, integers can all be ENUMERATED. You can get every &gt; single one of these sets and find an &quot;enumerator&quot; function that will &gt; generate every member of this set if we just let it run forever.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; So this seems to be in accordance with your hypothesis, right? That &gt; every infinite set has the same size of infinity. BUT, what about &gt; all of the real numbers?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Well let&apos;s put it this way: let&apos;s just find all of the real numbers &gt; between 0 and 1. If THOSE have a higher degree of infinity than the &gt; natural numbers, then obviously ALL of the real numbers will have a &gt; higher cardinality than the natural numbers as well.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Now, if we can enumerate the real numbers (if there is any function &gt; that will produce every single one of the reals), then we can just &gt; write that list down, obviously.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I claim that I have some incredibly complicated way that will do &gt; just that. Here&apos;s my enumeration:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; 0.131972...<br/>&gt; 0.574659...<br/>&gt; 0.213331...<br/>&gt; 0.567893...<br/>&gt; 0.324324...<br/>&gt; 0.211323...<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; etc. Don&apos;t worry about the pattern. Now here&apos;s the problem:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; 0.131972...<br/>&gt; 0.574659...<br/>&gt; 0.213331...<br/>&gt; 0.567893...<br/>&gt; 0.324324...<br/>&gt; 0.211323...<br/>&gt; .<br/>&gt; .<br/>&gt; .<br/>&gt; 0.284934...<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Do you see the pattern? For each of the numbers in bold in the &gt; enumerator (the diagonals), I have put the number that is one more &gt; than that and generated a new number at the bottom in red as well. &gt; So where is THAT number in the enumerator?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Wherever in the enumerator that number is, it will eventually &gt; intersect the diagonal. When it does, at the precise digit that it &gt; intersects - that number will have to be the number OF the diagonal &gt; and that number PLUS ONE AT THE SAME TIME. This is impossible.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; So you laugh at me and prove me wrong. My enumerator isn&apos;t an &gt; enumerator after all.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; The key here is: ANY enumerator for the reals will fall prey to this &gt; same problem. The numbers can be listed and &quot;diagonalized&quot; in the &gt; same way.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; So anything that claims to be an enumerator for the reals, isn&apos;t.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; This means that the reals can&apos;t be listed, so they can&apos;t be put into &gt; a one-to-one correspondence with the natural numbers. They are of a &gt; higher degree of infinity. If you try this approach with just the &gt; irrationals, you will see that they can&apos;t be enumerated as well.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; They are all &quot;UNCOUNTABLE.&quot;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; And that&apos;s the story -Mike<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; On Tue, Jun 3, 2008 at 4:59 PM, Ozan Yarman &gt; &lt;ozanyarman@...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt; &gt; I certainly have a hard time grasping how there can be more &gt; irrational<br/>&gt; &gt; numbers between any two whole numbes as opposed to rational &gt; numbers.

This &gt;&gt; means we can graph set of all rational numbers can be as a plane -- &gt;&gt; the horizontal axis would represent an increase in the denominator &gt;&gt; and the vertical axis would represent an increase in the numerator. &gt;&gt; So is the degree of infinity of a plane more than that of a line?<br/>&gt;&gt;  &gt;&gt; For a long, long time, mathematicians thought the answer was &quot;yes.&quot; &gt;&gt; And then someone came up with a pattern so obvious that it was almost &gt;&gt; stupid: If you just draw diagonal lines going from (0,1) to (1,0), &gt;&gt; and then from (0,2) to (2,0), and etc, you hit everything. So you can &gt;&gt; list all of the numbers and pair them up with the natural numbers.<br/>&gt;&gt;  &gt;&gt; Well, if you look at it this way:<br/>&gt;&gt;  &gt;&gt;  1: 1/1<br/>&gt;&gt;  &gt;&gt;  2: 1/2<br/>&gt;&gt;  3: 2/1<br/>&gt;&gt;  &gt;&gt;  4: 1/3<br/>&gt;&gt;  5: 2/2<br/>&gt;&gt;  6: 3/1<br/>&gt;&gt;  &gt;&gt;  7: 1/4<br/>&gt;&gt;  8: 2/3<br/>&gt;&gt;  9: 3/2<br/>&gt;&gt; 10: 4/1<br/>&gt;&gt;  &gt;&gt; etc.<br/>&gt;&gt;  &gt;&gt; Then every positive rational number in existence will be reached - &gt;&gt; some multiple times (which is okay). To include the negative &gt;&gt; rationals as well:<br/>&gt;&gt;  &gt;&gt;  1:  1/1<br/>&gt;&gt;  2: -1/1<br/>&gt;&gt;  &gt;&gt;  3:  1/2<br/>&gt;&gt;  4: -1/2<br/>&gt;&gt;  5:  2/1<br/>&gt;&gt;  6: -2/1<br/>&gt;&gt;  &gt;&gt;  7:  1/3<br/>&gt;&gt;  8: -1/3<br/>&gt;&gt;  9:  2/2<br/>&gt;&gt; 10: -2/2<br/>&gt;&gt; 11:  3/1<br/>&gt;&gt; 12: -3/1<br/>&gt;&gt;  &gt;&gt; etc.<br/>&gt;&gt;  &gt;&gt; So we can pair up all of the rational numbers with the natural &gt;&gt; numbers. A bijection exists between the two sets, they are of the &gt;&gt; same degree of infinity, etc.<br/>&gt;&gt;  &gt;&gt; Another way to say this is that the set of all rational numbers, &gt;&gt; natural numbers, integers can all be ENUMERATED. You can get every &gt;&gt; single one of these sets and find an &quot;enumerator&quot; function that will &gt;&gt; generate every member of this set if we just let it run forever.<br/>&gt;&gt;  &gt;&gt; So this seems to be in accordance with your hypothesis, right? That &gt;&gt; every infinite set has the ! same siz e of infinity. BUT, what about &gt;&gt; all of the real numbers?<br/>&gt;&gt;  &gt;&gt; Well let&apos;s put it this way: let&apos;s just find all of the real numbers &gt;&gt; between 0 and 1. If THOSE have a higher degree of infinity than the &gt;&gt; natural numbers, then obviously ALL of the real numbers will have a &gt;&gt; higher cardinality than the natural numbers as well.<br/>&gt;&gt;  &gt;&gt; Now, if we can enumerate the real numbers (if there is any function &gt;&gt; that will produce every single one of the reals), then we can just &gt;&gt; write that list down, obviously.<br/>&gt;&gt;  &gt;&gt; I claim that I have some incredibly complicated way that will do just &gt;&gt; that. Here&apos;s my enumeration:<br/>&gt;&gt;  &gt;&gt; 0.131972...<br/>&gt;&gt; 0.574659...<br/>&gt;&gt; 0.213331...<br/>&gt;&gt; 0.567893...<br/>&gt;&gt; 0.324324...<br/>&gt;&gt; 0.211323...<br/>&gt;&gt;  &gt;&gt; etc. Don&apos;t worry about the pattern. Now here&apos;s the problem:<br/>&gt;&gt;  &gt;&gt; 0.*_1_*31972...<br/>&gt;&gt; 0.5*_7_*4659...<br/>&gt;&gt; 0.21*_3_*331...<br/>&gt;&gt; 0.567*_8_*93...<br/>&gt;&gt; 0.3243*_2_*4...<br/>&gt;&gt; 0.21132*_3_*...<br/>&gt;&gt; *.*<br/>&gt;&gt; *.*<br/>&gt;&gt; *.*<br/>&gt;&gt; *0.284934...*<br/>&gt;&gt;  &gt;&gt; Do you see the pattern? For each of the numbers in bold in the &gt;&gt; enumerator (the diagonals), I have put the number that is one more &gt;&gt; than that and generated a new number at the bottom in red as well. So &gt;&gt; where is THAT number in the enumerator?<br/>&gt;&gt;  &gt;&gt; Wherever in the enumerator that number is, it will eventually &gt;&gt; intersect the diagonal. When it does, at the precise digit that it &gt;&gt; intersects - that number will have to be the number OF the diagonal &gt;&gt; and that number PLUS ONE AT THE SAME TIME. This is impossible.<br/>&gt;&gt;  &gt;&gt; So you laugh at me and prove me wrong. My enumerator isn&apos;t an &gt;&gt; enumerator after all.<br/>&gt;&gt;  &gt;&gt; The key here is: ANY enumerator for the reals will fall prey to this &gt;&gt; same problem. The numbers can be listed and &quot;diagonalized&quot; in the &gt;&gt; same way.<br/>&gt;&gt;  &gt;&gt; So anything that claims to be an enumerator for the reals, isn&apos;t.<br/>&gt;&gt;  &gt;&gt; This means that the reals can&apos;t be listed, so they can&apos;t be put into &gt;&gt; a one-to-one correspondence with the natural numbers. They are of a &gt;&gt; higher degree of infinity. If you try this approach with just the &gt;&gt; irrationals, you will see that they can&apos;t be enumerated as well.<br/>&gt;&gt;  &gt;&gt; They are all &quot;UNCOUNTABLE.&quot;<br/>&gt;&gt;  &gt;&gt; And that&apos;s the story -Mike<br/>&gt;&gt;  &gt;&gt; On Tue, Jun 3, 2008 at 4:59 PM, Ozan Yarman &gt;&gt; &lt;ozanyarman@... &lt;mailto:ozanyarman@...&gt;&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;&gt; &gt; I certainly have a hard time grasping how there can be more irrational<br/>&gt;&gt; &gt; numbers between any two whole numbes as opposed to rational numbers. &gt;&gt; They<br/>&gt;&gt; &gt; are both infinite, hence, the same &quot;amount&quot;.

We can also<br/>construct a number by taking the first digit of the first number, and<br/>the second of the second number, etc:</p><p>1: 0.127439...<br/>2: 0.423942...<br/>3: 0.623763...<br/>4: 0.142948...<br/>5: 0.534854...<br/>6: 0.348275...<br/>.<br/>.<br/>.</p><p>D: 0.123955...</p><p>It&apos;s easy to see that this number will appear in the list somewhere,<br/>since the list supposedly has *every* irrational number in it. The place<br/>where this number meets the diagonal in the list will have the digits<br/>simply &quot;align,&quot; as the number formed by the diagonal will simply be the<br/>same as this number here.</p><p>BUT... what about the number formed by taking the diagonal and<br/>incrementing each digit by 1?</p><p>1: 0.127439...<br/>2: 0.423942...<br/>3: 0.623763...<br/>4: 0.142948...<br/>5: 0.534854...<br/>6: 0.348275...<br/>.<br/>.<br/>.</p><p>D: 0.234066...</p><p>This number, as this list is supposed to contain &quot;every&quot; irrational<br/>number, will also have to be in the list somewhere. What about where<br/>this number meets the diagonal? What will the digit be? The number will,<br/>by definition, be one digit higher than the diagonal - therefore, where<br/>the number meets the diagonal, that digit will have to be the digit of<br/>the diagonal AND that digit plus one *at the same time*. So it breaks<br/>down.</p><p>Interesting, but what does it mean? It means that any supposed &quot;list&quot;<br/>containing all of the irrational numbers won&apos;t contain all of the<br/>irrational numbers. The concept of a list containing every irrational<br/>number is contradictory. No list can be made that will contain all of<br/>the irrational numbers, even if we let that list go on forever.</p><p>On the other hand, a list can be made that WILL contain all of the<br/>natural numbers, and all of the rational numbers, if we let them run<br/>forever. By starting at 0 and incrementing by 1, we&apos;ll eventually get<br/>every natural number, and check the other thread for a way to have every<br/>rational number be eventually hit in the same way.</p><p>This means that you can&apos;t pair up every natural number with every<br/>irrational number.  If that were possible, then you&apos;d be able to write<br/>them out in such a list, which would then prove itself to not be a list<br/>at all.</p><p>So in other words, any way you have to compute systematically every<br/>irrational number will fail.

There&apos;s actually a list for that:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;  <a href="http://groups.yahoo.com/group/metatuning">http://groups.yahoo.com/group/metatuning</a></p><p>I&apos;m looking at metatuning now. The first three topics I found involved<br/>a joke of the agreement between FEMA and NIST, someone selling their<br/>CD&apos;s on ebay, and a link to a news article about Albert Hoffman dying.</p><p>Doesn&apos;t really seem like it would really fit in over there.</p><p>Especially when the discussion over rational and irrational numbers is<br/>necessary to understand the entire point of Rick Ballan&apos;s original<br/>tuning-related thread. People shouldn&apos;t have to go to another yahoo<br/>group to understand this. Believe it or not, not everyone understands<br/>math well enough to already know this stuff. Therefore, given the<br/>discussion at hand, it&apos;s &quot;related&quot; to tuning.</p><p>It&apos;s not too much of a stretch for things related to tuning to be<br/>discussed on a tuning forum.</p><p>&gt;  &gt; The topic we are discussing here is necessary<br/>&gt;  &gt; to fully understand the other thread.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;  It isn&apos;t. Rationals and irrationals approximate one<br/>&gt;  another to far beyond the limits of human perception.<br/>&gt;  That&apos;s all that&apos;s relevant for microtonal music.</p><p>Who are you to decide what&apos;s relevant to microtonal music? The point<br/>of Rick&apos;s original thread is whether the 12 tone equal tempered scale<br/>is actually a JI scale involving &quot;higher&quot; overtones due to various<br/>quantum mechanics-related effects.</p><p>So to understand that, he has to first explain various aspects of<br/>quantum mechanics to the people who don&apos;t already understand.<br/>Alternatively, people have different views of quantum mechanics and so<br/>a discussion of it is formed, the results of which will reflect<br/>directly back on the original tuning-related idea. Regardless of this,<br/>we then hear cries about it being &quot;off-topic.&quot;</p><p>Then, we eventually get past the quantum mechanics side of things and<br/>we end up in a discussion about whether the numbers involved are<br/>actually rational or irrational numbers. The argument slowly builds<br/>that they ARE actually irrational because there are &quot;more&quot; irrational<br/>numbers than rational numbers. Some people disagree, and so a<br/>discussion about that starts in another side-thread. This side-thread<br/>is obviously necessary because it once again ties directly back to<br/>Rick Ballan&apos;s original argument.</p><p>Quite a few microtonally related ideas have already come directly out<br/>of this, first and foremost the notion that 16:19:24 might actually be<br/>the minor chord that we&apos;re all used to rather than 10:12:15. From that<br/>there are a lot more questions, such as what are we actually hearing<br/>when we listen to temperament? Out of tune JI chords, or &quot;in tune&quot;<br/>higher-harmonic JI chords - how does it all work?</p><p>Of course, a discussion of this means we would get into gestalt<br/>psychology, which would likely for organizational purposes be best<br/>served with a side-thread of its own. This, I am sure, would be met<br/>with cries of it being &quot;off-topic,&quot; and so no progress will ever be<br/>made on anything. Especially if the realizations being made are<br/>cross-applicational, and in order to discuss them we are always going<br/>to be met with this &quot;off-topic&quot; nonsense from people who are either<br/>bent on dominating the discussion or haven&apos;t bothered to read the<br/>original threads to see how these seemingly oblique discussions relate<br/>back to tuning.</p><p>I, on the other hand, find this discussion - what it is we actually<br/>perceive when we hear tempered chords - extremely interesting and at<br/>the heart of the very reasons that I have joined the group at all. I<br/>would also say that it&apos;s most likely related to the reasons why many<br/>people have gotten interested in JI or microtonal music in the first<br/>place. It seems counter-productive to force everyone to move<br/>discussions such as these to the &quot;joke around&quot; group you posted above.<br/>These are the kinds of discussions where progress can get made. If<br/>we&apos;re not allowed to discuss these things because they would require<br/>loose discussions about related topics, then what are we going to<br/>discuss?</p><p>I don&apos;t think this group should be limited to just discussions about<br/>whether 53tet or 72tet is superior or whether miracle temperaments are<br/>more useful than diaschismatic ones.</p><p>-Mike</p></div><h3>Cornell III, Howard M &#x3C;howard.m.cornell.iii@...&#x3E;</h3><span>6/6/2008 2:36:26 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>If you measure it to any accuracy you require, and are confident you<br/>have obtained the correct width and length, you will find that the<br/>proportion is rational.

The true and actual dimension of the table could be<br/>measured in atomic diameters, say.  That would be an integer so the<br/>ratio of two dimensions would always be rational.

If you think that you have measured the dimensions<br/>with accuracy to within a certain proportion of an inch,  you can<br/>convert to that unit and also get a rational number.  The point is that<br/>you cannot make the table  pi, or e [base of natural logarithms],  feet<br/>or meters in dimension.  Therefore you could not measure an irrational<br/>number!

There is apparently no substitute for<br/>manual meta-analysis, FAQ-writing, etc.  And to date nobody<br/>has taken the time.</p><p>&gt; &gt; &gt; I don&apos;t think this group should be limited to just<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; discussions about whether 53tet or 72tet is superior<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; or whether miracle temperaments are more useful than<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; diaschismatic ones.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; Oh, I agree. And like Don Rumsfeld, I&apos;m also against cutting<br/>&gt; &gt; people&apos;s heads off.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; How clever.</p><p>Jon Stewart deserves the credit there.

But is there some other way that we are really<br/>hearing<br/>&gt; it?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Rick has been talking recently about how maybe we&apos;re hearing 3 steps of<br/>&gt; 12tet as being a slightly out-of-tune 19/16 ratio rather than a<br/>really out<br/>&gt; of tune 6/5 ratio. Which begs the question as to what are we<br/>hearing? Do we<br/>&gt; psychologically &quot;move&quot; these ratios to the nearest JI one (except<br/>that there<br/>&gt; are an infinite amount of them)?  If I play a JI minor chord with<br/>the minor<br/>&gt; third as 19/16 am I hearing THAT as an out of tune 6/5?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Or, if imposing the JI structure on these doesn&apos;t work, is there any<br/>sort of<br/>&gt; structure or way of understanding equal temperaments?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I think the context of it might matter. There is definitely some<br/>difference<br/>&gt; between 11-tet and 12-tet. I think that if you play this chord:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; 1:2:3:4:5:6<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; but you sharpen the &quot;5&quot; slightly (perhaps even to a different rational<br/>&gt; multiple/overtone), you will still most likely hear the resemblence<br/>to the<br/>&gt; overtone series and hear it that way. The sharpened &quot;5&quot; will cause some<br/>&gt; beating that you may or may not like, depending on the context. On<br/>the other<br/>&gt; hand, 3 steps of 12tet does sound an awful lot like 16:19, which has an<br/>&gt; entirely different *character* than 5:6. What is the nature of this<br/>change<br/>&gt; in character, and what does this character mean? Why do we sometimes<br/>hear<br/>&gt; intervals &quot;guided&quot; to their nearest match in a harmonic series, and<br/>why do<br/>&gt; we sometimes hear them as new entities in their own right with different<br/>&gt; feelings and characters to them?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I suppose the question is one of psychology: what causes someone to<br/>hear a<br/>&gt; certain interval as a mistuned form of another interval?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Abstractly put, what causes someone, when experiencing a phenomenon,<br/>to view<br/>&gt; that phenomenon as an altered version of another phenomenon?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; An offshoot of this question is musically, how can we &quot;guide&quot; a<br/>listener to<br/>&gt; hear different intervals as &quot;new&quot; phenomena, rather than &quot;out-of-tune&quot;<br/>&gt; versions of ones they already know? Many people upon hearing<br/>JI-tuned music<br/>&gt; for the first time often feel that it is simply an &quot;out-of-tune&quot;<br/>version of<br/>&gt; 12tet. Why do they hear it that way, rather than simply as having a<br/>&gt; different *character* (as 16:19 and 5:6 had different characters)?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I suspect it has something to do with psychological things having<br/>nothing to<br/>&gt; do with music causing one to cling to things one is already familiar<br/>with -<br/>&gt; and yet the question is inextricably tied in with music theory,<br/>especially<br/>&gt; microtonal theory.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Just some thoughts.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; -Mke<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; (Don&apos;t worry, Rick. Carl is used to me winding him up, and regularly<br/>&gt; &gt; threatens to censor me, but Carl has resisted the temptation for<br/>the past<br/>&gt; 15<br/>&gt; &gt; odd years, so I hope his inner curiosity will again prevail.)<br/>&gt;<br/> Not at all Mike, I&apos;m having a great time.

Can you clarify?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; -Mike<br/>&gt;<br/>Well imagine a universe where waves dominate i.e. our very own. Our<br/>sense of space and time come from waves of all types and every one of<br/>these can be Fourier Analysed down to component sine waves (time for<br/>eg is represented by the CLASS of all frequencies, not by the<br/>arbitrary choice of 1 second). Take f = 1/T, time = t, and cycles = n<br/>= ft. We then get t = nT. e.g. f = 440Hz, then 2 seconds requires n =<br/>880 cycles. Time is now a dependent variable, not a separate concept.</p><p>Now observe that number of cycles also means number of periods. t = nT<br/>can also be written t = T + T +...n factors. Therefore a complete<br/>cycle is &quot;1&quot; and the total number of cycles is N(0), countable<br/>infinity. If n = N(0) then t = N(0) sec since the product of<br/>aleph-zero by a number is itself. The length of the time line is N(0).</p><p>&quot;But n does not have to be whole&quot; you protest. Here&apos;s the rub. All<br/>real numbers on the t line can be mapped back into a single period.<br/>Let n = ft = N + r where N = 1,2,3... and 0 &lt; r &gt; 1. Since adding N to<br/>the sine function Y does not affect it then Y(N + r) = Y(r). because<br/>the sine wave has to be continuous, this means that the number of<br/>numbers inside a single period, r, is N(1), the number of real numbers.</p><p>We reach the peculiar circumstance that the number of numbers within a<br/>single period (the number or amount of r&apos;s) is larger than the number<br/>of periods (number of N&apos;s), i.e. a typical Cantor-esque proof. But we<br/>also see that the number of periods for one wave is rational and not<br/>irrational. Interesting.</p><p>I still get the feeling you&apos;re going to ask me something.</p><p>Rick</p></div>
