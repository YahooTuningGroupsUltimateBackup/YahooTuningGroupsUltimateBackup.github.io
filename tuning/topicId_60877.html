The tuning list, as it has evolved,<br/>ends up being about tuning, end of subject. MMM (Making Microtonal<br/>Music) was an attempt to have a forum with a focus on the music that<br/>can come from non12 tunings, with encouragement, tools, etc. Not<br/>perfect, but some people seem to feel better over there.

Cris<br/>has spent a lifetime not only playing acoustic instruments, but<br/>designing, refining, and building them as well. He lives in a world of<br/>vibrations and their accompanying resonances.
