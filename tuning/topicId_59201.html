It is basically a set of variation of a theme on a particular hexany transposed onto different ones, with changes in polyrhymns. the basic patterns come from Harold Courlander&apos;s book &quot; The Drum and the Hoe&quot;, an excellent book on the music of Haiti. It was the first real look at the music there, and his visit actually coincided with Maya Deren who produced a documentary on Voodun soon after. Harold Courlander is responsible for the african story used by Partch in Delusion, and also served as editor in chief for folkways records for a while. Toward the end of his life he collected many of the stories of the Hopi.<br/>The Fourth World of the Hopis is one of my favorite books. Countless other books too.<br/>At one point he had a lawsuit against Alex Haley, since it appears that a few chapters of one of his books ended up in &quot;Roots&quot; It is good to know that for someone who i am sure did not make tons of money in his life, the settlement left him ( and imagine his lawyers) in good standing.</p><p>Even  though the polyrhymns are simple as never beyond 4 against 5, the individual lines often will be in 5 or 12 long making it more complex.<br/>In practically all cases one hand will be using 3 notes in which the other hand will be the other 3 of the hexany, hence it inversion.</p><p>Performed on the marimba on the cover over Xenarmonikon made by Stephen smith, who now exist on these list under a different name. It  requires quite large mallets, the heads made out of used tires, making playing quite awkward and difficult for someone not really trained as a percussionist.<br/>Ok enough disclaimers<br/><a href="http://anaphoria.com/haiti.ogg">http://anaphoria.com/haiti.ogg</a><br/>--<br/>Kraig Grady<br/>North American Embassy of Anaphoria Island &lt;<a href="http://anaphoria.com/">http://anaphoria.com/</a>&gt;<br/>The Wandering Medicine Show<br/>KXLU &lt;<a href="http://www.kxlu.com/main.html">http://www.kxlu.com/main.html</a>&gt; 88.9 FM Wed 8-9 pm Los Angeles</p></div>
