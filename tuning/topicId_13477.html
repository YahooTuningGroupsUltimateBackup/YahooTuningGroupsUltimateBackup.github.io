When playing a high note on a thick metal guitar string, you<br/>have a lot of stiffness to contend with, since the thickness of the strings<br/>is significant compare with the vibrating length of the string. Meanwhile,<br/>if you play, say, the first fret on the highest string, the inharmonicity<br/>will be minimal since the thickness is very small compared to the vibrating<br/>length. On a piano, the thickest strings are also the longest ones, so the<br/>inharmonicity is closer to constant than on a guitar.</p><p>Ever hear a Martin with heavy-guage strings where the low notes sound like a<br/>piano?

My metal bodied Dobro clone, a Johnson has this problem.<br/>I went for heavier strings to beef up the tone<br/>and the bass strings are so heavy there is no tone.</p><p>So I think its all down to string size.

Heavier strings tuned<br/>&gt;to the same pitch as lighter strings are going to<br/>&gt;be stiffer AND have more tension.</p><p>True, but the two don&apos;t always vary together. It depends what you hold<br/>constant. If you increase the length, you&apos;ll need a higher tension to get<br/>the same pitch out of a given string, but you&apos;ll have less stiffness.</p><p>&gt;Been at this guitar thing 27 years man...I think<br/>&gt;tension and stiffnesss are the SAME THING!!!</p><p>Similar, but not quite the same. See<br/><a href="http://www.phy.duke.edu/~dtl/36hd_pno.html">http://www.phy.duke.edu/~dtl/36hd_pno.html</a> for a complete description of how<br/>the varying parameters of tension, stiffness, etc. are compromised in the<br/>engineering of the piano. There&apos;s a lot more to the design of the piano than<br/>you might have thought!</p><p>We had a detailed discussion about stiffness and inharmonicity here about<br/>two or three years ago, maybe back on the Mills server. Can anyone find it?</p><p>&gt;So whats your solution to inharmonicity on the<br/>&gt;guitar? Novak seems have a solution but I haven&apos;t<br/>&gt;heard one yet.</p><p>Ah yes, the Novak design has longer bass strings making for lower stiffness<br/>(despite higher tension) and thus less inharmonicity. Charlie Hunter plays<br/>an eight-string Novak and sounds like a bass player and guitar player at<br/>once -- and the bass sound is terrific!</p></div><h3><a id=13526 href="#13526">ðŸ”—</a>phv40@hotmail.com</h3><span>9/25/2000 8:29:51 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@egroups.com">tuning@egroups.com</a>, &quot;Paul H.
