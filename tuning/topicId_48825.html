I had been calling those mixed over / under chords.</p><p>&gt; I&apos;m confused, especially after reading the rest of your message.<br/>&gt; Which of the above would you call mixed over / under chords, and why?<br/>&gt; Why do you think such chords are important?</p><p>Sorry, I misread it.</p><p>I didn&apos;t see the comma in 1/7:1/6:1/5:1/4, 5:6:7:9<br/>and thought you meant the whole thing as a single chord.</p><p>I was thinking of ones like<br/>4/7 2/3 4/5 1/1 5/4 3/2 7/4</p><p>and I just like the sound of them when improvising on the Lambdoma.<br/>In the Lambdoma view I call them &quot;Polytonality&quot; chords becuase<br/>it is a sort of polytonality of the over and undertone series in<br/>the context of the Lambdoma.</p><p>Rightio, thanks for the suggestion to explore half-diminished<br/>sevenths. I didn&apos;t know about those and have just looked<br/>them up.  Here is where I found it btw, seems a good site<br/>for chord theory:</p><p><a href="http://www.tonalityguide.com/xxnondom4.php">http://www.tonalityguide.com/xxnondom4.php</a></p><p>Will look into it. I&apos;m learning chord theory myself<br/>at the same time as I program the chord progression<br/>player :-).</p><p>You can play half diminished sevenths as e.g. Cm7b5</p><p>However, I &quot;corrected&quot; the vii7<br/>for the player, not realising that it should<br/>play a diminished fifth in that notation. Will<br/>fix that.</p><p>Csm7dim5 will play 1/1 7/6 7/5 7/4<br/>so that is the 1/7 1/6 1/5 1/4 flavour,<br/>so that one is supported.</p><p>One could play also<br/>1/1 6/5 7/5 9/5</p><p>by using the notation k for 5-limit j.i. with 10/9 and 9/5,<br/>and s for septimal as, which makes it:</p><p>Ckm7sdim5</p><p>so that is the 5 6 7 9 chord.</p><p>Though - I just found a bug there so need<br/>to fix it first before you can try it out<br/>- it is playing the 9/5 as a 9/10<br/>- transposed down an octave.<br/>Anyway it will work after that.</p><p>Then that leaves the 10:12:15:17</p><p>That&apos;s more of a challenge. I&apos;ll<br/>mull it over and see what I come up<br/>with.</p><p>In its root position it is<br/>20/17 24/17 30/17 2/1<br/>so that wouldn&apos;t be supported<br/>except with much use of the @ notation.</p><p>In its first inversion as you presented it<br/>though it is<br/>Cjm@17/10<br/>for<br/>6/5 3/2 17/10 2/1<br/>which isn&apos;t quite so cumbersome.</p><p>But I wonder, maybe I can do better than that, and<br/>think of some way to integreate<br/>it into a harmonic series notation in its<br/>first inversion,</p><p>Something like this:<br/>Cho10m6</p><p>where the ho10 means to tune all notes to<br/>harmonic series ratios in a harmonic<br/>series starting at 10/10 11/0 etc.<br/>- where it just goes up the harmonic series<br/>until it encounters a note that is within a<br/>quarter tone of the 12eq pitch.</p><p>You could use hu for the undertone series<br/>there and hou for a mixed over and undertone<br/>series so it finds the closest going up and<br/>down both ways at once, and again finds the first<br/>encountered</p><p>Then also this suggests the need to be able<br/>to tune a particular inversion<br/>of the chord.</p><p>Here we want to tune it in its</p><p>So that could be maybe<br/>Ci.ho10m7dim5</p><p>where the i. means to do the tuning<br/>for the chord in its first inversion<br/>and you add extra dots there for each<br/>inversion so i.. would be the second<br/>inversion etc. So it tunes it in the<br/>first inversion and thn rotates it<br/>back into the original position to get<br/>the desired chord.</p><p>Anyway thanks, I&apos;ll think just a bit more<br/>about this and then code it. Not hard<br/>to do the actual coding at all.<br/>Any comments on these ideas at this point?</p><p>Thanks,</p><p>Robert</p></div><h3><a id=48867 href="#48867">ðŸ”—</a>Paul Erlich &#x3C;paul@stretch-music.com&#x3E;</h3><span>12/1/2003 1:18:05 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;Robert Walker&quot; &lt;robertwalker@n...&gt;<br/>wrote:<br/>&gt; HI Paul,<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; Maybe the best e-mail address for me is<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; support@r...<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; as that domain is hosted at my web host.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; That&apos;s the one we used.

(and<br/>their flats and sharps and augmented and diminished<br/>chords)?</p><p>Thing is that in 12 eq of course the I7 is always 7b<br/>to make it a dominant seventh of the subdominant.<br/>But what should one do here? I suppose rotate the<br/>scale around so the 9 is 18. But what about e.g. I9sus2<br/>- should the 2 there be chromatically altered too?<br/>- I mean as 0 3 isntead of 0 2. Perhaps?</p><p>First thought anyway is:<br/>I9 = 1 4 7 9 (11) tuned to the subdominant key = 0 7 13 18<br/>Im9 = 1 4 7 9 (11) in the minor mode = 0 6 13 17 (22)<br/>where I suppose the m and M symbols should be thought of as<br/>affecting the entire chord - immediately after the note name<br/>the effect goes forwards and backwards and if used later in<br/>the chord then it goes forwards only to affect notes that follow.<br/>So the seventh in  Im9 is 17 and in I9 is 18.</p><p>So ImM9 = 0 6 13 18 (22)<br/>and IMm9 = 0 7 13 17 (22)</p><p>And Isus2 possibly as tuned to the subdominant too<br/>= 1 2 4 7 9 (11) = 0 3 7 13 18 (22)</p><p>Can do I and i for major and minor and the sequence<br/>of triads in the Pentachordal Major is then<br/>I II III iv V VI VII viii ix x (XI)<br/>and then for the dominant &quot;seventh&quot; (i.e. ninth) chords it is<br/>I9 II9aug7  III9aug7 iv9 Vm9 VI9 VII9 viii9 ix9 xM9</p><p>where that uses the upper / lower case convention so<br/>xM9 is the minor major chord and Vm9 is the major minor chord.</p><p>But that is a bit hard to remember. So would do<br/>a &quot;keep to mode&quot; option and perhaps use an &apos;%&apos; for that,<br/>so in 12-eq %I is I and %II is ii etc<br/>so here with this example, %II9 will mean II9aug7 and %V9 will mean Vm9 etc<br/>which will save the newbie user from the need to remember<br/>which chords are which, and indeed be easier to type for everyone.<br/>(I have just added this % notation in for 12-eq in most recentupload)</p><p>Anyway, if the tricky issues can get sorted out, this general idea<br/>is immediately generalisable to scales with any number<br/>of notes - you just need to set a &quot;major&quot; and &quot;minor&quot; mode and you can then<br/>immediately use the notation, leaving the user free to do something<br/>totally unconventional there too if they so wish, no restriction on<br/>what has to count as major or minor modes.</p><p>So, that is the first thought that springs to mind for this.<br/>What do you think? Any suggestions or ideas of other approaches to<br/>follow up?</p><p>What do you think about these ideas? Not that there is probably a<br/>single &quot;right&quot; answer but maybe we can come up with something that<br/>is a fairly natural extension of the 12 eq notation.</p><p>One would also need a way of showing that the entire chord progression is<br/>to be interpreted in 22 equal because that affects how all the<br/>numbers are interpreted in the chords, e.g. 9 instead of 7 for the &quot;seventh&quot;<br/>of twelve equal, and there maybe just prefix<br/>the start of the progression with &quot;eq22&quot; to do that.<br/>Indeed, that would then let user change notation in the middle of the progression<br/>if they wish.</p><p>This  gives the flexibility to use this notation even with scales that<br/>aren&apos;t themselves 22 equal, e.g. j.i. 22 tone scales or ones<br/>with more or less notes because the chord symbols would actually pick<br/>out exact pitches in 22eq, then use closest to those in the currently<br/>selected scale.</p><p>I&apos;ll think it over a bit before doing it as it is the sort of thing<br/>where you can probably find a neat way of doing it that makes the<br/>coding much easier. Amount of code needed is probably rather modest,<br/>only a few dozen or maybe at most a couple of hundred lines of so.<br/>But it is a matter of deciding what one wants to achieve with it.</p><p>Thanks,</p><p>Robert</p></div><h3><a id=49038 href="#49038">ðŸ”—</a>Paul Erlich &#x3C;paul@stretch-music.com&#x3E;</h3><span>12/3/2003 10:19:09 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;Robert Walker&quot; &lt;robertwalker@n...&gt;<br/>wrote:<br/>&gt; Hi Paul<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I&apos;ve added that harmonic overtone and undertone notation and those<br/>three<br/>&gt; Cm6 chords to the microtonal chord progression player.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; See<br/><a href="http://tunesmithy.netfirms.com/fts_help/chord_progr_player.htm#ex_Cm6">http://tunesmithy.netfirms.com/fts_help/chord_progr_player.htm#ex_Cm6</a></p><p>I think you got one of the chords wrong -- 1/1 6/5 3/2 5/3 should be<br/>1/1 6/5 3/2 12/7 (which I called 1/(4:5:6:7) and 1/6:1/5:1/4:2/7)) --<br/>it&apos;s the minor tetrad of my paper.</p><p>&gt; Also, looking at your paper, I have had a few preliminary ideas<br/>about how<br/>&gt; to add in the decatonic chords notation for 22 equal.</p><p>Thanks for taking the time to look at it! And if you get a chance,<br/>try making up some chord progressions; you can pretty drag four<br/>sticks fractally through the decatonic sand and come up with nice<br/>harmonies.</p><p>&gt; Idea is to allow the user to set a major mode, e.g.<br/>&gt; Standard Pentachordal Major:<br/>&gt; 0 2 4 7 9 11 13 16 18 20 (22)<br/>&gt; and a minor mode, e.g.<br/>&gt; Standard Pentachordal Minor:<br/>&gt; 0 2 4 6 9 11 13 15 17 19 (22)<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; But not really sure how to use those in the notation.<br/>&gt; - sketched out a few ideas but they aren&apos;t entirely<br/>&gt; satisfactory.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; ie. how to interpret, e.g. I9 and i9 (9 here = &quot;seventh&quot; of 12 eq)<br/>&gt; when one wants to make a distinction between major and minor<br/>depending on the<br/>&gt; numeral as upper or lower.</p><p>What&apos;s the letter &quot;I&quot; here? Is it a Roman numeral? If so, you<br/>wouldn&apos;t even have the 9 on the symbol, if the chord you mean is 0-7-<br/>13-18 in 22-equal.</p><p>&gt; If one keeps to notes within the mode and not permit<br/>&gt; chromatically altered notes it is very simple of course<br/>&gt; to do, so that can certainly be done.</p><p>Sounds good for the basic chord symbols -- as long as there&apos;s also a<br/>way to permit chromatically altered notes, as in the diatonic case.</p><p>&gt; Do you have any thoughts about what I9 and i9 should<br/>&gt; be as scale degrees,</p><p>Hmm . . . I&apos;m not sure why you would want to use the symbol 9. I<br/>guess the &apos;default&apos; is 1-4-7-9.</p><p>&gt; and ditto for the other upper and lower case<br/>&gt; symbols in the Roman numeral notation?</p><p>I&apos;m visiting this point in your message from the future. Capital<br/>means major tetrad, lower case means minor tetrad, just like they<br/>mean major triad and minor triad in diatonic music, where the<br/>diminished triad is viio or iio and augmented is III+, so you could<br/>use + for augmented decatonic tetrads too.</p><p>&gt; (and<br/>&gt; their flats and sharps and augmented and diminished<br/>&gt; chords)?</p><p>Should work out alright . . .</p><p>&gt; Thing is that in 12 eq of course the I7 is always 7b<br/>&gt; to make it a dominant seventh of the subdominant.<br/>&gt; But what should one do here? I suppose rotate the<br/>&gt; scale around so the 9 is 18. But what about e.g. I9sus2<br/>&gt; - should the 2 there be chromatically altered too?<br/>&gt; - I mean as 0 3 isntead of 0 2. Perhaps?</p><p>How would a sus2 arise in the decatonic system? It wouldn&apos;t seem to,<br/>but . . . I&apos;m afraid we may have to take this more slowly.</p><p>&gt; First thought anyway is:<br/>&gt; I9 = 1 4 7 9 (11) tuned to the subdominant key = 0 7 13 18</p><p>I&apos;d just call it I, not I9.</p><p>&gt; Im9 = 1 4 7 9 (11) in the minor mode = 0 6 13 17 (22)</p><p>Yes!</p><p>&gt; where I suppose the m and M symbols should be thought of as<br/>&gt; affecting the entire chord - immediately after the note name<br/>&gt; the effect goes forwards and backwards and if used later in<br/>&gt; the chord then it goes forwards only to affect notes that follow.<br/>&gt; So the seventh in  Im9 is 17 and in I9 is 18.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; So ImM9 = 0 6 13 18 (22)<br/>&gt; and IMm9 = 0 7 13 17 (22)</p><p>Those chords are defined in my paper, so again, you can drop the 9<br/>from the designation.</p><p>&gt; And Isus2 possibly as tuned to the subdominant too<br/>&gt; = 1 2 4 7 9 (11) = 0 3 7 13 18 (22)</p><p>Now I&apos;m really confused. Diatonically speaking, Isus2 and Isus4<br/>chords have the same number of notes as I chords. And why would<br/>you &quot;tune to the subdominant&quot;?</p><p>&gt; Can do I and i for major and minor and the sequence<br/>&gt; of triads in the Pentachordal Major is then<br/>&gt; I II III iv V VI VII viii ix x (XI)</p><p>Should be tetrads,</p><p>I II+ III+ iv VMm VI VII viii ix xmM</p><p>&gt; and then for the dominant &quot;seventh&quot; (i.e. ninth) chords it is<br/>&gt; I9 II9aug7  III9aug7 iv9 Vm9 VI9 VII9 viii9 ix9 xM9</p><p>See above. If you want no 9 you can use the no9 symbol.</p><p>&gt; But that is a bit hard to remember. So would do<br/>&gt; a &quot;keep to mode&quot; option and perhaps use an &apos;%&apos; for that,<br/>&gt; so in 12-eq %I is I and %II is ii etc</p><p>nice</p><p>&gt; so here with this example, %II9 will mean II9aug7 and %V9 will mean<br/>Vm9 etc<br/>&gt; which will save the newbie user from the need to remember<br/>&gt; which chords are which, and indeed be easier to type for everyone.</p><p>Well, as you can in the table on page 11 on my paper, this is the way<br/>I did it, though I used I II III IV V VI VIII IX and X to mean the<br/>tetrads occuring as 1-4-7-9, in each of the eight given modes.</p><p>&gt; Anyway, if the tricky issues can get sorted out, this general idea<br/>&gt; is immediately generalisable to scales with any number<br/>&gt; of notes - you just need to set a &quot;major&quot; and &quot;minor&quot; mode and you<br/>can then<br/>&gt; immediately use the notation,</p><p>or maybe eight modes! :)</p><p>&gt; leaving the user free to do something<br/>&gt; totally unconventional there too if they so wish, no restriction on<br/>&gt; what has to count as major or minor modes.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; So, that is the first thought that springs to mind for this.<br/>&gt; What do you think?</p><p>Cool stuff! You can try to, ultimately, support all the notations<br/>SCALA supports . . .</p><p>&gt; One would also need a way of showing that the entire chord<br/>progression is<br/>&gt; to be interpreted in 22 equal</p><p>Or any such &apos;decatonic&apos; tuning . . .</p><p>&gt; because that affects how all the<br/>&gt; numbers are interpreted in the chords, e.g. 9 instead of 7 for<br/>the &quot;seventh&quot;<br/>&gt; of twelve equal,</p><p>Or any diatonic tuning, presumably . . .</p><p>&gt; and there maybe just prefix<br/>&gt; the start of the progression with &quot;eq22&quot; to do that.</p><p>Well, you would eventually be able to notate other scales that 22-<br/>equal supports (including, for example, &apos;Pythagorean/septimal&apos;<br/>diatonic scales I mention in my paper that go 4 1 4 4 1 4 4 for the<br/>minor mode, etc), so it&apos;s really not 22-equal that needs to be<br/>specified . . .</p><p>&gt; This  gives the flexibility to use this notation even with scales<br/>that<br/>&gt; aren&apos;t themselves 22 equal, e.g. j.i. 22 tone scales or ones<br/>&gt; with more or less notes because the chord symbols would actually<br/>pick<br/>&gt; out exact pitches in 22eq, then use closest to those in the<br/>currently<br/>&gt; selected scale.</p><p>Just as conventional notation really only works out in meantone<br/>scales (without getting unexpected &quot;wolves&quot; and the like), decatonic<br/>notation would work out only in certain tuning systems.</p><p>&gt; I&apos;ll think it over a bit before doing it as it is the sort of thing<br/>&gt; where you can probably find a neat way of doing it that makes the<br/>&gt; coding much easier. Amount of code needed is probably rather modest,<br/>&gt; only a few dozen or maybe at most a couple of hundred lines of so.<br/>&gt; But it is a matter of deciding what one wants to achieve with it.</p><p>Hopefully the above is a start. I&apos;d love to go further!</p></div><h3><a id=49167 href="#49167">ðŸ”—</a>Robert Walker &#x3C;robertwalker@ntlworld.com&#x3E;</h3><span>12/5/2003 7:26:40 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Hi Paul,</p><p>&gt; &gt; In minor keys, presumably it is III in classical notation,</p><p>&gt; Yes.</p><p>&gt; &gt; for the IIIb which I think you would use in the popular mixed<br/>&gt; &gt;notation.</p><p>&gt; I doubt that, Robert.</p><p>I&apos;m sure I&apos;ve seen it like that.</p><p>Here:</p><p><a href="http://www.torvund.net/guitar/progressions/LaFolia.asp">http://www.torvund.net/guitar/progressions/LaFolia.asp</a></p><p>&gt; &gt; Okay - I understand that this doesn&apos;t apply to the classical<br/>notation.<br/>&gt; &gt; But would apply to the popular notation. The C7 has a Bb because<br/>&gt; &gt; it is a diatonic chord of F major, though it can also be used<br/>&gt; &gt; as a chromatically altered chord in other keys.</p><p>&gt; OK, but that doesn&apos;t apply for decatonic music, where there<br/>are &quot;seventh chords&quot; all over the scale!</p><p>Fine. Right I suppose that is the point, while diatonic music has<br/>only the one, decatonic has lots, so a single seventh chord could<br/>be a non chromatically altered decatonic chord for several tonics.</p><p>&gt; Diatonic harmony falls apart in 53-equal, or any other non-meantone.</p><p>I suppose the point is that if it is a non meantone n-et then some diatonic progressions<br/>will lead to diesis shifts.</p><p>&gt; &gt; not the best one for a particular context. So maybe user<br/>&gt; &gt; has to be able to decide on a just interpretation of<br/>&gt; &gt; the chord symbols or something. Maybe this can be<br/>&gt; &gt; left to later; I think it could get rather complex...</p><p>&gt; Yeah, I think this should be handled mathematically, according to<br/>&gt; mappings of the basic lattice intervals.</p><p>Maybe it will link in somehow with the work on the real time adaptive<br/>tunings later on then... But I may just leave  it user<br/>specified as the easy way out :-).</p><p>I&apos;ve just programmed the classical roman numerals for 12t, and with<br/>the no to omit notes btw &amp; working, but not yet uploaded, a bit more to do<br/>before it is quite ready, mainly to write some help for it and test<br/>it a bit. It also lets you set a key signature<br/>now when you use the roman numerals, and change the key signature<br/>at any point in the progression, using e.g. Ebminor, Fmajor<br/>etc  (all one word). Prob. ready quite soon.</p><p>Looks though as if things to do with changing the interpretation<br/>of the major and degree numbers will prob. have to wait a bit though,<br/>can&apos;t see a nice neat way of doing it with the existing code<br/>right now (If I&apos;d thought about that in advance, when starting on this then<br/>it might have been another matter). Will see again later...</p><p>Anyway will finish this and the classical roman numerals now.</p><p>Thanks,</p><p>Robert</p></div><h3><a id=49253 href="#49253">ðŸ”—</a>Robert Walker &#x3C;robertwalker@ntlworld.com&#x3E;</h3><span>12/7/2003 7:13:36 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>HI Paul, and anyone interested,</p><p>Just to say I uploaded the new version with the classical Roman Numerals,<br/>microtonal key signatures (in 19, 31 and 72-et), and the no notation.</p><p><a href="http://www.tunesmithy.netfirms.com/fts_help/chord_progr_player.htm">http://www.tunesmithy.netfirms.com/fts_help/chord_progr_player.htm</a><br/>download from<br/><a href="http://www.robertinventor.com/fts_download.htm">http://www.robertinventor.com/fts_download.htm</a><br/>(and look for it in your purple FTS Extra Shortcuts folder on your desktop).</p><p>This explains about the Roman Numerals system as I have it programmed<br/>at present:</p><p><a href="http://www.tunesmithy.netfirms.com/fts_help/chord_progr_player.htm#roman_numerals">http://www.tunesmithy.netfirms.com/fts_help/chord_progr_player.htm#roman_numerals</a></p><p>If anyone has any suggestions or anyone happens to notice anything I need to correct in that section do say.</p><p>Thanks,</p><p>Robert</p></div><h3><a id=49303 href="#49303">ðŸ”—</a>Paul Erlich &#x3C;paul@stretch-music.com&#x3E;</h3><span>12/8/2003 7:14:06 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;Robert Walker&quot; &lt;robertwalker@n...&gt;<br/>wrote:<br/>&gt; Hi Paul,<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; In minor keys, presumably it is III in classical notation,<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; Yes.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; for the IIIb which I think you would use in the popular mixed<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt;notation.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; I doubt that, Robert.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I&apos;m sure I&apos;ve seen it like that.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Here:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; <a href="http://www.torvund.net/guitar/progressions/LaFolia.asp">http://www.torvund.net/guitar/progressions/LaFolia.asp</a></p><p>Ugh.</p><p>&gt; &gt; Diatonic harmony falls apart in 53-equal, or any other non-<br/>meantone.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I suppose the point is that if it is a non meantone n-et then some<br/>diatonic progressions<br/>&gt; will lead to diesis shifts.</p><p>No, it&apos;s (syntonic) comma shifts, actually.
