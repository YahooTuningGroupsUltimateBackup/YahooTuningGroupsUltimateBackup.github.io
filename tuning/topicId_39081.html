Is this what you&apos;re getting at? It&apos;s<br/>hard to tell.</p><p>Other than this possibility, I have trouble seeing how tuning to the<br/>harmonic overtone series represents a falsehood. Perhaps I am in need<br/>of enlightenment; perhaps I am trapped in well-travelled tracks of<br/>thought. At any rate, I&apos;m interested, please elucidate.</p><p>-Jeremy</p><p>&gt;<br/>&gt; This may be a suitable occasion to attempt to explain by an analogy.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; This concept comes from Book VII of Plato&apos;s Republic, and is my analogy<br/>&gt; (not John Harrison&apos;s)<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Imagine that you are holding a coiled spring between a light source and<br/>&gt; a wall.<br/>&gt; A shadow is cast on the wall by the spring.<br/>&gt; There are positions to which you can move the spring so that it will<br/>&gt; cast a shadow on the wall, which resembles a sine wave.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; You could measure the shadow, and map the topology of the shadow.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; or you could map the topology of the spring.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I am suggesting that the advocates of whole number ratios, are mapping<br/>&gt; the &quot;shadow&quot;; whereas John &apos;Longitude&apos; Harrison was mapping the<br/>&gt; &quot;spring&quot;.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Some people enjoy chasing shadows.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Have fun!</p><p>--<br/><a href="http://fastmail.fm">http://fastmail.fm</a> - Email service worth paying for.
