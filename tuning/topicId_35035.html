Good you meet you.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Hi! I think it was Louie Armstrong who said something like:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; If you have to ask what jazz is, no one will ever be able to explain<br/>&gt; it to you. (I don&apos;t remember the exact words, but this is the gist of<br/>&gt; it.)</p><p>Sure, I&apos;ve quoted good ol&apos; Louie on this point many times. But then there<br/>are lots of musicians--great one&apos;s--who haven&apos;t a clue about what they are<br/>doing. Unfortunately, many of them become teachers.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I would say the same statement applies to good intonation. In my<br/>&gt; experience, there are plenty of people, including many &quot;musicians&quot;,<br/>&gt; who absolutely fail to detect its presence or absence and therefore<br/>&gt; lack the means to ever experience what it is. I find that those who<br/>&gt; DO know what it is have no trouble at all detecting its absence or<br/>&gt; presence and they immediately recognize each other.</p><p>Does that include all of those choral directors out there who pound out<br/>&quot;notes&quot; on the piano in hopes that their choirs will &quot;sing in tune&quot;?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I am NOT referring here to esoteric tastes developed in the context<br/>&gt; of microtonality, such as a taste for very sharp thirds, etc. I&apos;m<br/>&gt; talking common practice musicianship (he crosses himself in anxious<br/>&gt; anticipation of dreadful, vitriolic replies). I have found that in<br/>&gt; practice in that context, the only people who think it&apos;s all a matter<br/>&gt; of taste belong to the clueless group (deep breath).</p><p>What about tastes for *slightly* sharp thirds developed in the context of<br/>normal everyday choral singing by people who never heard of microtonality?<br/>When I frequented this site many months ago, I entered believing that JI was<br/>the basis for all &quot;good tuning.&quot; I left realizing that there are some<br/>mysteries to be explored. Is it merely taste? Probably not. Is it merely<br/>adjusting to &quot;best&quot; intervals. Obviously not. To some extent, we&apos;re all<br/>clueless regarding the complete truth about intonation. (Shall we just go<br/>join Louie? I prefer not.)<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I would also say based on personal experience that some who know a<br/>&gt; lot more than common practice musicians about microtonality and<br/>&gt; alternative tunings, etc. do not themselves have a solidly musical<br/>&gt; ear. That is to say, they can&apos;t play or sing in tune as well as a<br/>&gt; good common practice musician.

A lot<br/>of people who fiddled with a piano somehow worked through the mushy tuning<br/>and discovered &quot;nature&apos;s way.&quot; The sad thing is that many don&apos;t even know<br/>what they did. It just sounded better that way. (Hi, Louie.
