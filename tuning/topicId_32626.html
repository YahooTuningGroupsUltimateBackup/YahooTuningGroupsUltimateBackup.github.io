Yes, mathematics and other cultural features were absorbed<br/>by Akkadian culture.  However, it is pure speculation that the tuning for the<br/>Babylonians was the same as their precursors of a different ethnic stock.<br/>Since spoken language has been such a poor indicator of ethnic stock, I would<br/>be quite cautious about making more than a speculation about Sumerian tuning<br/>based on the later texts that were uncovered.</p><p>Best, Johnny Reinhard</p></div>
