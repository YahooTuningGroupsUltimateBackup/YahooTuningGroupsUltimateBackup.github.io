I&apos;m certainly familiar with the<br/>effect from singing Barbershop.</p><p>I wasn&apos;t talking about the identities of the parts, I was talking about the<br/>identity of the timbre.  As for a string quartet playing in 12-tET, I&apos;ll<br/>believe it when I hear it!</p><p>[Erlich]<br/>&gt;Very good point! Johnny Reinhard has made the same point. That is one reason<br/>&gt;why when using &quot;adaptive JI&quot;, I think one should stop a couple of cents<br/>&gt;short of getting the simulaneities _exactly_ in JI.</p><p>Other factors like rhythm, timbre, and instrument placement will have a far<br/>greater effect.  The only reason Barbershop blends so much is because it&apos;s<br/>monophonic.  From the few examples out there, it is every bit as easy, if<br/>not easier, to distinguish counterpoint when the tuning is beatless.</p><p>-Carl</p></div><h3>Paul H.
