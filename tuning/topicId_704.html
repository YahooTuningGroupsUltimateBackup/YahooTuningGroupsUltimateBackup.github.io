The<br/>recital was part of the Edinburgh International Festival and, as far as<br/>I can ascertain, was one of only two items of (intentional) non 12-tet<br/>music on the programme. The other was an all night performance of Raga<br/>which included the great Hariprasad Chaurasia among the musicians.<br/>Unfortunately I missed that one. : - (</p><p>Both these and other recitals began at 1030pm and cost exactly &iuml;&iquest;&half;5.00 as<br/>part of a new initiative to attract a younger audience. For that<br/>princely sum you could have heard Messiaen&apos;s Visions de l&apos;Amen, Mozart&apos;s<br/>Divertimento K563, Mahler&apos;s Das Lied von der Erde or Bach&apos;s Goldberg<br/>Variations to name but a few items, and all performed by top<br/>professionals.</p><p>I plagiarise parts of the programme notes for the following introduction<br/>: -</p><p>Stockhausen wrote Stimmung (Tuning) in the winter of1968 in Madison,<br/>Connecticut just after a visit to Mexico. Stimmung is inspired by his<br/>Mexican experiences and by the more mundane constraints of a housebound<br/>existence during a cold snap with two small children. Purportedly the<br/>first major Western composition to be based solely on vocal harmonics,<br/>Stimmung uses specific overtones produced when singing a fundamental (B<br/>flat). Stockhausen chose six pitches - harmonics 2,3,4,5,7 and 9 - and<br/>then took overtones from those six pitches to create a further six<br/>harmonic series. This would make an interesting multi-dimensional<br/>lattice for those of that inclination. Intoning phonetic sounds, there<br/>are also other elements intertwined amongst the 51 sections. There are<br/>29 magic names - gods both ancient and modern - as well as days of the<br/>week (a forerunner of Stockhausen&apos;s ongoing seven-day operatic cycle).<br/>Also included are five pieces of erotic poetry.</p><p>Now to the performance. The six singers, 2s, 1ms, 2t, 1b enter wearing<br/>loose white cotton pyjamas and sit in a semicircle on white cushions.<br/>Apart from their individual microphones and a cassette player to set the<br/>fundamental tone, the stage is empty.</p><p>The music is instantly identifiable if you have any familiarity with<br/>Just Intonation. Sonorities are set up and varying textures explored,<br/>much of the texture set by hand signals from individual singers in turn.<br/>The bass and one of the tenors had obviously studied overtone singing<br/>and managed to consistently produce the characteristic sound of this<br/>impressive technique. Although the others all held their microphones<br/>close to their cheeks and throats in an effort to coax overtones, they<br/>were less successful. At first I put this down to the fact that the<br/>lower voices would be richer in overtones being lower in the audible<br/>spectrum, but later the mezzo-soprano began to &apos;catch&apos; various partials,<br/>so my tentative conclusion is that some were better prepared than<br/>others. Maybe not - I&apos;m unsure as to how much the technique is called<br/>for throughout. One of the sopranos made up for her lack of overtone<br/>technique by communicating effectively with the audience through<br/>gesture, smile and movement.</p><p>This minor point along with a touch of operatic vibrato are my only<br/>criticisms of what was a superlative reading of a complex and unique<br/>score. Oh - add to that the presence of the ghetto blaster. A tanpura or<br/>other acoustic drone would have been visually and aurally more<br/>appropriate.</p><p>The piece moves slowly but never drags. Moments of humour arise at, say,<br/>the sudden mention of a day of the week, the word taken up by the others<br/>and thrown around on the different harmonic tones. A modernist reworking<br/>of Haydn&apos;s surprises perhaps, bringing the same wry smiles and titters<br/>from the audience. At times the sonorities were deeply satisfying in<br/>themselves. And the pace and flow of the work ensure a constant shift of<br/>attention.</p><p>Whatever else you might think of Stockhausen, this piece works with an<br/>audience and I would thoroughly recommend to the serious composer of<br/>microtonal or JI music that they sit down and listen to it score in hand<br/>and try to learn from it. I came away feeling much more optimistic about<br/>what singers might be able to produce given that this consort, although<br/>professional, is much more at home with Byrd and Tallis. I yearn for a<br/>specialist consort, but there is a serious gap in the repertoire.</p><p>Other reflections : -</p><p>Modernism can be fun and is obviously having a bit of a day out. I also<br/>heard Boulez conducting Varese at the Proms.</p><p>The so-and-so who reviewed Stimmung could only point out how strange it<br/>was for performers to wear white clothing (very 60s he said) and<br/>concluded with the profound comment that the piece could have been given<br/>a more contemporary slant by being performed faster. Still, nobody ever<br/>builds statues of  reviewers.</p><p>Kind Regards</p></div>
