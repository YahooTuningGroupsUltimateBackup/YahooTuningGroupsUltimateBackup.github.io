It could even be the interval between a 5/4 and 81/64 (more<br/>properly an &quot;eighthtone&quot;).  The quartertone was the value for anything smaller than<br/>a semitone.  It was the difference between the 4/3 and an 11/8, heard clearly<br/>in the natural Swiss alphorn.  No need to be reactionary to it just because<br/>it is the negative image of 12-tet.

Therefore, the<br/>&quot;basic form&quot; (the term used by Haba) of any group of tones<br/>is neither a scalar nor a chordal structure but both a scalar<br/>and a chordal structure; for example, the &quot;basic form&quot; of<br/>the tones C D E F G A B is the C-major scale or a secundal<br/>chord consisting of the tones of the C-major scale.<br/>Furthermore, Haba regards the C-major scale to be the<br/>&quot;basic scale&quot; and because of this, the secudnal chord<br/>consisting of its tones to be the basic harmony in the<br/>half-tone system (rather than a tertian structure derived<br/>from the tones fothe C-major scale, C E G B D F A).&quot;</p><p>Battan notes that Haba conceived of 24-edo as &quot;bichromatic&quot;,<br/>that is (in my terminology), as 2 bike-chains of 12-edo<br/>a semitone apart. This is exactly in keeping with<br/>Moellendorf&apos;s theory, which is what originally inspired<br/>Haba to work with microtonality. See my webpages on M.:</p><p><a href="http://www.sonic-arts.org/monzo/moellendorf/book/contents.htm">http://www.sonic-arts.org/monzo/moellendorf/book/contents.htm</a></p><p>p 35:<br/>&quot; A significant amount of Haba&apos;s early theoretical work<br/>deals with acoustics, specifically with the relationships<br/>between the overtones and the twelve notes of the<br/>equal-tempered scale and among the overtones themselves.<br/>Most of his work in this area is at a very elementary level,<br/>never progressing beyond a presentation of simple acoustical<br/>data such as the interval ratios between the fundamental and<br/>each overtone and the fractional amounts that the frequencies<br/>of overtones deviate from the tones of the equal-tempered<br/>system.<br/> Haba&apos;s early theoretical writing focuses on the quarter-tone<br/>system rather than on the third-tone, the sixth-tone, and the<br/>twelfth-tone systems, which are first discussed by Haba in<br/>_Neue Harmonielehre_.&quot;</p><p>Battan describes a 2-string &quot;monochord&quot; which Haba had<br/>in his home and on which he apparently made acoustical<br/>experiments. It has 7 sets sets of numbers written on it<br/>which essentially are the 1-udentity (i.e., the whole string)<br/>of the subharmonic scales beginning on 22, 24, 26, 28,<br/>32, 36, and 40, then the numbers which correspond to<br/>the 4/3, 2/1, and 4/1 ratios above these marked of<br/>one each quarter of the string.</p><p>So it does indeed seem that he was at least familiar<br/>with some basic JI theory.</p><p>Finally moving on to _Neue Harmonielehre_ itself ...</p><p>p 74:<br/>&quot;In the treatise, he states that the use of microtones,<br/>particularly quarter-tones, is justified for two basic<br/>reasons, acoustical considerations and historical<br/>precedence. Haba writes: &apos;The quarter-tone system is<br/>principally based on the inherent law of divisions shown<br/>by the overtones in the sixth octave of the overtone series.&apos;<br/>[p 194 of _Neue Harmonielehre_]&quot;</p><p>Battan discusses Haba&apos;s 24-edo theory in some detail, then<br/>describes his theories on 18-, 36-, and 72-edo on only p 83-84.</p><p>p 84:<br/>&quot;He points out that the sixth-tone system is a synthesis<br/>of the half-tone and third-tone systems and that the<br/>twelfth-tone system is the synthesis of the four other<br/>systems. Haba&apos;s discussion of the third-tone, sixth-tone,<br/>and twelfth-tone systems proves to be little more than a<br/>cataloging of some of the possible sonorities available.<br/>Haba believes that it is the reader&apos;s responsibility, rather<br/>than the writer&apos;s, to decide how to use these constructions<br/>in actual composition.<br/> Despite its impressive listing of chordal and scalar<br/>constuctions, the discussion of the microtonal systems sheds<br/>little light on the actual function of microtones within a<br/>microtonal system. Clearly, in Haba&apos;s conception, microtones<br/>serve as much more than embellishing tones with[in] a<br/>composition, but how and when they should be integrated<br/>into the melodic and harmonic texture is not clarified.&quot;</p><p>-monz<br/><a href="http://tonalsoft.com">http://tonalsoft.com</a><br/>Tonescape microtonal music software</p></div><h3>monz &#x3C;monz@tonalsoft.com&#x3E;</h3><span>10/22/2005 1:30:29 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Hi Aaron and other Chicago-area list members,</p><p>I meant to include this in my last (big) post about<br/>Haba and 36-edo ... but actually perhaps it&apos;s better<br/>that it appears here by itself.</p><p>There&apos;s an unpublished manuscript by Haba from 1939 in the<br/>manuscript collection at the Newberry Library in Chicago,<br/>which i (and probably you and a few others here) would<br/>like very much to read: _Die Musik im Sechsteltonsystem_.</p><p>It&apos;s a typewritten manuscript composed of 5 articles:</p><p>I:<br/>Die Musik im Sechsteltonsystem<br/>[Music in the 1/6-tone system]</p><p>Ia:<br/>Vierteltonmusik und Sechsteltonmusik<br/>[1/4-tone music and 1/6-tone music]</p><p>II:<br/>Die ersten Komposition f&uuml;r Viertelton-piano<br/>[The first compositions for 1/4-tone piano]</p><p>IIa:<br/>Harmonische Grundlagen des Zw&ouml;lftonsystem: Der thematische<br/>und der unthematische Musikstil<br/>[Harmonic basis of the 12-tone system: The thematic and<br/>athematic musical style]</p><p>IIb:<br/>Musikalische und geisteswissenschaftliche Grundlagen des<br/>thematischen und unthematischen Musikstils und neuer Musikformen<br/>[Musical and spirit-scientific basis of the thematic and athematic<br/>musical styles and new music forms]</p><p>Not quite sure how to translate &quot;geisteswissenschaftliche&quot;<br/>... my attempt with &quot;spirit-scientific&quot; is probably a<br/>little off.</p><p>So can anyone in Chicago get their hands on these?</p><p>-monz<br/><a href="http://tonalsoft.com">http://tonalsoft.com</a><br/>Tonescape microtonal music software</p></div><h3>klaus schmirler &#x3C;KSchmir@online.de&#x3E;</h3><span>10/22/2005 2:44:23 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>monz wrote:</p><p>&gt; IIb: &gt; Musikalische und geisteswissenschaftliche Grundlagen des<br/>&gt; thematischen und unthematischen Musikstils und neuer Musikformen<br/>&gt; [Musical and spirit-scientific basis of the thematic and athematic<br/>&gt; musical styles and new music forms]<br/>&gt;  &gt; &gt; Not quite sure how to translate &quot;geisteswissenschaftliche&quot;<br/>&gt; ... my attempt with &quot;spirit-scientific&quot; is probably a &gt; little off.</p><p>Yes it is.

Battan writes Haba&apos;s harmonium was made by<br/>August Foerster who is better known building pianos, including the<br/>quartertones ones (St.H-F dates the organ 1936 instead of 1927; ROS<br/>pages seem to be down today but in his book Gellerman mentions Carl<br/>Foerster building reed organs but in Milwaukee, WI). I found<br/>information about the firm Straube, and also Otto Pappe who designed<br/>and built Moellendorff&apos;s and also Wyschnegradsky&apos;s, and this company<br/>apparently made harmoniums at least till the 1950s (I can&apos;t now find a<br/>label from Teofil Kotzkiewicz either, that M. says will make his<br/>organs for Austrian musicians, there is not much other reference them)<br/>.

Schiedmayer and if August Foerster made Haba&apos;s I<br/>can add it to the list too.</p><p>Clark</p><p><a href="http://www.xs4all.nl/~huygensf/english/haba.html">http://www.xs4all.nl/~huygensf/english/haba.html</a><br/><a href="http://www.reedsoc.org/">http://www.reedsoc.org/</a><br/><a href="http://eamusic.dartmouth.edu/~franck/iw/bio-en.htm">http://eamusic.dartmouth.edu/~franck/iw/bio-en.htm</a><br/><a href="http://pappe.our-kin.com/Photo-Gallery/Annotated/Straub%">http://pappe.our-kin.com/Photo-Gallery/Annotated/Straub%</a><br/>20Harmoniumbau.htm<br/><a href="http://launch.groups.yahoo.com/group/MakeMicroMusic/message/10290">http://launch.groups.yahoo.com/group/MakeMicroMusic/message/10290</a></p></div><h3>wallyesterpaulrus &#x3C;wallyesterpaulrus@yahoo.com&#x3E;</h3><span>10/25/2005 10:51:40 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;monz&quot; &lt;monz@t...&gt; wrote:</p><p>&gt; Gawel used a<br/>&gt; 19-tone subset of 36-edo,</p><p>You mean Liese did, and Gawel told us about it (right?) . . .</p></div><h3>threesixesinarow &#x3C;CACCOLA@NET1PLUS.COM&#x3E;</h3><span>10/27/2005 3:32:37 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>&gt; Teofil Kotzkiewicz</p><p>Janko practise clavier in the folder &apos;Vienna&apos; at the photos section on<br/>this website.</p></div>
