Since<br/>I was regrettably very much occupied with my job during the time you had this<br/>big discussion on the subject, I am not entirely sure whether I got this<br/>right. Please have a look at <a href="http://members.aol.com/bpsite/modes.html">http://members.aol.com/bpsite/modes.html</a> and let<br/>me know your opinion. Please send any comments to my private address<br/><a href="mailto:hpbohlen@aol.com">hpbohlen@aol.com</a> since I will have to skip the list for a few weeks while<br/>traveling in Europe.</p><p>Greetings, Heinz</p></div>
