The question-what tuning system did he have in mind for<br/>his &quot;harpsichord&quot; composition &quot;Ut Re Mi Fa Sol La&quot; (from the &quot;Fitzwilliam<br/>Virginal Book&quot;), which modulates enharmonically to distant, non<br/>meantone-friendly (at least with 12 notes per ocatve) keys like e-flat minor<br/>via a pivoting hexachordal scale passage in whole notes which forms a cantus<br/>firmus around which the marvellous structure is built.....the footnote to the<br/>Dover edition of my score raises the doubtful proposition that Bull was<br/>thinking in 12-tet (it&apos;s an older turn of the century edition from what I<br/>recall...I&apos;d have to dig it out of my scores, most of which are still in<br/>boxes from my recent move)</p><p>I think he was thinking in extended meantone, and I&apos;ve started to realize a<br/>19-tet version of the piece in midi, which I&apos;ve had to put aside for a while,<br/>but I will post if anyone is interested. It certainly sounds great in thsi<br/>tuning, and I doubt Bull was writing in 12-tet for his harpsichord.

The first ten and a half marked bars (through<br/>the third variation), and from bar 42 (the ninth variation) through<br/>the end, function impeccably in a D major flavored mean-tone (the<br/>diminished sixth between A# and F).

This could be realized with a double<br/>keyboard instrument, perhaps the mother-daughter Muselar, or any ad<br/>hoc arrangement of dual keyboards.

Sweetness and light prevail until the ninth variation<br/>on C, where one must fall back to the original temperament by the<br/>second beat, and quite a frolic it is from there.</p><p>On second hearing, I am not convinced that the Gx tuning is<br/>decisively better than the Ab.

The<br/>music is so interesting that way.  When I saw the posts this summer<br/>about Everett Hafner&apos;s article on this subject, I decided to post my<br/>page.  My article is unfinished, and not targeted at this audience.<br/>I was speaking to the music education establishment, or their next<br/>generation I think, when I wrote it.  It needs a revision and a<br/>trim, based on what I&apos;ve learned from reading the tuning group.  It<br/>is nearly indigestible, with comments on every piece in the 48, and<br/>quite a few others, purely regarding enharmonic mismatches, but<br/>without the requisite musical texts.</p><p>I do not intend to start a thread on Bach&apos;s tuning, which has been<br/>treated at length on several occasions by your most senior panel,<br/>but merely to borrow your forum to make my notes available to other<br/>interested players.  Whatever the errors and poor scholarship in the<br/>presentation, the substance of the notes, piece by piece,<br/>demonstrate that a meantone temperament is sufficient with only a<br/>few exceptions.  Playing them this way has demonstrated to me that<br/>there is important musical value in doing so, and I hope to persuade<br/>others that the composer intended something like this.</p><p>Thanks for your patience.  And thanks again to Aaron for the tip<br/>about Bull&apos;s Ut Re Mi.  My fun this weekend has been to apply<br/>transposed meantones to this piece, and I was rewarded to find that<br/>Dr. Bull too was a transposer of meantones.  If he had a 19-note<br/>keyboard, he could and would have made use of more than 12 within<br/>each block, whereas he confined himself to the 12-note meantone<br/>paradigm within his three sections, while inventing the most<br/>outlandish tonality shift between them.</p><p>-Jeff</p></div><h3><a id=48905 href="#48905">ðŸ”—</a>Aaron K.
