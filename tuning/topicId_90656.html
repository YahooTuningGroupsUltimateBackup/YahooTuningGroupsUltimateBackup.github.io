He notes<br/>that as the integers get larger, the sense of consonance<br/>generally gets &quot;weaker.&quot;</p><p>More broadly, &quot;just&quot; can simply mean &quot;rational&quot;; but<br/>often implies that an interval has a rational size<br/>deemed harmonious or ideal for a given style.</p><p>Please let me be one of the first people to praise<br/>the beauties of 16th-century European counterpoint<br/>and meantone temperament while asserting that other<br/>world musical styles and tuning systems can be<br/>equally beautiful. What is or isn&apos;t perceived as<br/>&quot;just&quot; in a meantone context shouldn&apos;t govern our<br/>usage in other contexts.</p><p>For example, if asked to give an example of a &quot;just&quot;<br/>third, I might immediately mention 7/6, which tends<br/>to be present in a pure or near-pure form in lots of<br/>my favorite tunings.</p><p>However, in a 16th-century European context, speaking<br/>of &quot;a just 7/6&quot; would likely be incongruous, because<br/>while Praetorius (actually writing early in the next<br/>century) actually used the term &quot;wolf&quot; specifically<br/>for an augmented second in 1/4-comma meantone almost<br/>identical to this ratio, even Vicentino in 1555 found<br/>this &quot;minimal third&quot; leaning to the dissonant side,<br/>and thus generally best put aside, as likewise the<br/>near-7/4 of his 31-note meantone cycle -- although<br/>he liked and recommended a near-11:9 as leaning<br/>toward consonance!</p><p>There is indeed a certain incongruity in speaking<br/>of &quot;a just 32/27&quot; _in such a context_, since meantone<br/>was intended precisely to move away from the<br/>Pythagorean intonation which still plays a very<br/>respectable role in world music, and toward more<br/>specifically the ratios of 5/4 and 6/5. But must<br/>we all, in various parts of the world and pursuing<br/>many different musical styles and ideals, be bound<br/>by 16th-century European conventions and judgment.<br/>If so, we maybe shouldn&apos;t speak of a &quot;just 7/4&quot; either.</p><p>In music where major and minor thirds are expected<br/>to be at or close to 5/4 and 6/5, it&apos;s natural to<br/>take these ratios as the reference point for &quot;just,&quot;<br/>not only because they are rational, but because<br/>they are the sonorous ideal.</p><p>In a different context, 32/27 could actually be<br/>considered a just approximation of another ideal<br/>tuning for the minor third in some styles: 19/16,<br/>for example in 16:19:24, which may have a special<br/>stability because it is based in an octave<br/>multiple of the fundamental.</p><p>And in a setting where thirds -- major, minor,<br/>or Zalzalian (i.e. middle or neutral) -- are expected<br/>generally to have rather complex ratios, I can<br/>and do speak of a &quot;just&quot; or &quot;near-just&quot; 13/11, 14/11,<br/>33/26, 33/28, 17/14, 21/17, 16/13, 11/9, etc.</p><p>Here usage follows style and intention. In a meantone<br/>around 1/5-comma in the 18th century, an interval<br/>around 14/11 would arise as a diminished fourth,<br/>viewed as anything but in tune outside of some<br/>special idioms where a diminished fourth is permitted<br/>and indeed desired (for example, between two upper<br/>voices both forming conventional concords with the<br/>bass -- or, at least, that is a 16th-century pattern).</p><p>In a 21st-century temperament around 704 cents used<br/>with a main focus on the intervals formed by a<br/>17-note chain of fifths, a &quot;near-just&quot; 13/11 or 14/11<br/>is a regular major or minor third -- quite unlike<br/>the situation in meantone! Language follows style.</p><p>I begin with the premise that participants in this<br/>group may come from any world musical tradition or<br/>stylistic aspiration.</p><p>When discussing European meantone conventions, or<br/>corresponding conventions in other world musics,<br/>it is appropriate to follow meantone conventions.<br/>In the many other contexts that can and do arise,<br/>a &quot;just 32/27&quot; is fine, and I would be happy to<br/>use it myself.</p><p>Of course, this doesn&apos;t mean that 32/27 is as<br/>simple as 7/6 or 13/11, but the ratio itself<br/>informs us of this greater complexity.</p><p>As to 32/27, there is also the &quot;isoharmonic&quot;<br/>phenomenon, where a sonority such as<br/>17:22:27:32:37 if precisely tuned can have<br/>a special kind of coherence and euphony.<br/>Here tuning that 32/27 &quot;just&quot; might be<br/>especially important! And let&apos;s not forget<br/>the related differential coherence of Jacques<br/>Dudon, brilliantly illustrated in the Ethno2<br/>tuning collection.</p><p>This semantic territory has been explored<br/>many times on this list, and agreeement to<br/>disagree is probably the best outcome.<br/>The term &quot;rational intonation&quot; or RI is<br/>available as a neutral ground: Joe Monzo<br/>and I were part of a process on the list<br/>about a decade ago that resulting in the<br/>coining (or reinvention?) of this term.</p><p>Most appreciatively,</p><p>Margo Schulter<br/>mschulter@...</p></div><h3>Marcel de Velde &#x3C;m.develde@...&#x3E;</h3><span>7/5/2010 10:27:33 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Hello Margo,</p><p>Thanks for your thoughts on this.<br/>And I agree with them for the most part.</p><p>This semantic territory has been explored<br/>&gt; many times on this list, and agreeement to<br/>&gt; disagree is probably the best outcome.<br/>&gt; The term &quot;rational intonation&quot; or RI is<br/>&gt; available as a neutral ground: Joe Monzo<br/>&gt; and I were part of a process on the list<br/>&gt; about a decade ago that resulting in the<br/>&gt; coining (or reinvention?) of this term.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Most appreciatively,<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Margo Schulter<br/>&gt;</p><p>I agree that the agreement to disagree on this subject is the best outcome,<br/>atleast for now :)</p><p>But I&apos;d also like to explain which meaning the words Just Intonation have<br/>for me personally.<br/>One can for instance tune a piano to exactly 12edo and say it is &quot;in tune&quot;.<br/>But one would mean it is &quot;in tune&quot; to the 12edo, a certain concept.<br/>But one cannot say this piano is tuned &quot;Just&quot;.</p><p>Just Intonation has taken on 2 meanings.<br/>One is a system of tuning (with little though some agreement) where for<br/>instance the major scale is 1/1 9/8 5/4 4/3 3/2 5/3 15/8 2/1 (though there&apos;s<br/>some disagreement here too), and in this sense it&apos;s a system similar to<br/>12edo in that it&apos;s a made up and stated system of how to tune, and the name<br/>Just Intonation was attached to it, just like 12tet / 12edo was attached to<br/>the modern western tuning.</p><p>The other meaning of &quot;Just Intonation&quot; is quite different. It is an<br/>objective description of tuning &quot;Just&quot; or &quot;in tune&quot;, and currently there is<br/>no consensus on how to tune for instance common practice music &quot;in tune&quot; in<br/>an objective sense.<br/>It is infact hard to describe even, what is &quot;in tune&quot; in an objective sense.<br/>Many belief that there is no such thing possible even. As an example take<br/>comma pumps.<br/>I belief such a thing IS possible, and that there is only one way to tune<br/>something &quot;in tune&quot; in an objective sense.<br/>I belief that what our ear hears as perfectly &quot;in tune&quot; has a mathematical<br/>logic behind it. (and that this cannot be reduced to fixed small ratios liek<br/>6/5 for minor third, but instead is a complex music theoretical system)<br/>And this mathematical logic behind the perfect &quot;in tune&quot; tuning is what I<br/>understand behind the words &quot;Just Intonation&quot;.<br/>Quite literally the words Just Intonation have this meaning, to tune Just.</p><p>Now I personally don&apos;t care what people have used / mis-used / abused this<br/>name for, or which ratios people have attached to the word &quot;Just&quot;.<br/>If I belief I&apos;m finding out about this mathematical system behind objective<br/>perfect &quot;in tune&quot; tuning, I will use the words &quot;Just&quot; and &quot;Just Intonation&quot;<br/>to describe it, as it&apos;s the true meaning of those words. Rational intonation<br/>doesn&apos;t cover it in my opinion, and why should I even search for other words<br/>when Just Intonation is the word that truly describes my intentions.</p><p>When people search the internet for &quot;Just Intonation&quot;, they hope to find THE<br/>pure tuning system that is &quot;in tune&quot; and &quot;correct&quot;.<br/>Wether such a thing exists or not, as long as I belief that what I&apos;m doing<br/>is just that, I feel that I&apos;m more than entitled to use the term Just<br/>Intonation.<br/>And I will continue to do so :)</p><p>What I can do is differentiate from other systems that are called &quot;Just<br/>Intonation&quot; by an additive to the word.<br/>For instance Marcel&apos;s Just Intonation, or something like that. (that should<br/>make some people happy).</p><p>Kind regards,<br/>Marcel</p></div><h3>genewardsmith &#x3C;genewardsmith@...&#x3E;</h3><span>7/5/2010 1:07:49 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, Afmmjr@... wrote:</p><p>&gt; Do we have another name for a 32/27?</p><p>You mean aside from &quot;Pythagorean minor third&quot;?

A small major third is most harmoniously placed below a<br/>large minor third (4:5:6), and a small minor third below a large<br/>major third (6:7:9). These two divisions of the fifth, the pental<br/>or 5-limit and septimal or 7-limit, are most audibly pure or<br/>&quot;just,&quot; although the term &quot;just&quot; can also be apply to many, or<br/>indeed any, of the other rational ratios a major or minor third<br/>may take on. There&apos;s a vast middle range between pental and<br/>septimal, with some of us often tuning regular thirds in this<br/>region.</p><p>Examples in this middle range are a just 32/27 or 13/11 -- and<br/>also, in the &quot;upper middle&quot; range, 19/16, with some people<br/>finding 16:19:24 notably stable. A related point, of course, is<br/>that in some styles thirds are considered basic stable concords,<br/>and in others as relatively concordant or &quot;assonant&quot; adjuncts to<br/>simpler concords like 2:3:4.</p><p>&gt;&gt; This semantic territory has been explored<br/>&gt;&gt; many times on this list</p><p>&gt; I&apos;ve never seen this particular issue arise before.

This needs choices of minor thirds that are close to the same when inverted. (6/5)^4 = 2.073...gives a far worse 8ve than (19/16)^4 = 1.988..or 2 - 0.0114... or (1215/1024)^4 = 1.982... or 2 - 0.017...Of course one could probably use 6/5 in a dim so long as it was retuned for each inversion. But as I was saying, the min 3 as a tonic and in a diminished are really entirely different beasts. It is only in 12 tet that they happen to be tuned the same. And for the dim, the tempered would be the &apos;ideal&apos; since it reaches the 8ve exactly.</p></div><h3>genewardsmith &#x3C;genewardsmith@...&#x3E;</h3><span>7/9/2010 7:11:56 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;rick&quot; &lt;rick_ballan@...&gt; wrote:<br/>And for the dim, the tempered would be the &apos;ideal&apos; since it reaches the 8ve exactly.<br/>&gt;</p><p>Except it sounds kind of boring.</p></div><h3>Marcel de Velde &#x3C;m.develde@...&#x3E;</h3><span>7/9/2010 9:46:57 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Ah about the tempered diminished opinions differ, lets agree to disagree :)<br/>We&apos;ve been there before :) And I&apos;m against tempering.</p><p>Btw by about the same logic one can construct the 7-tone diatonic scale from<br/>the 15/8 2/1 (17/8) 9/4 (19/8) 5/2 harmonic segment duplicated by a fourth<br/>(or fifth depending on view) to get 15/8 2/1 9/4 5/2 4/3 3/2 5/3.<br/>One could see this as a 3+5 scale.</p><p>One could construct a 3+7 scale (not using the prime 5 at all) in a similar<br/>way:<br/>21/16 11/8 (23/16) 3/2 (25/16) 13/8 (27/16) 7/4, which gives the following<br/>scale when duplicated by a fourth and with 3/2 as the 1/1:</p><p> 1/1 13/12 7/6 11/9 4/3 13/9 14/9 7/4 11/6 2/1<br/>|<br/>  0:          1/1           C    Dbb   unison, perfect prime<br/>  1:         13/12                     tridecimal 2/3-tone<br/>  2:          7/6           D#   Eb    septimal minor third<br/>  3:         11/9                      undecimal neutral third<br/>  4:          4/3           F    Gbb   perfect fourth<br/>  5:         13/9                      tridecimal diminished fifth<br/>  6:         14/9                      septimal minor sixth<br/>  7:          7/4           A#   Bb    harmonic seventh<br/>  8:         11/6                      21/4-tone, undecimal neutral seventh<br/>  9:          2/1           C    Dbb   octave</p><p>Looks like potentially a GREAT arabic like scale.<br/>One would not harmonize this as western music (though one could move the<br/>original segment in fifths /fourths just like western music).

By the way, this 12-note set also includes a number of the<br/>scales or modes discussed in Secor&apos;s article above.</p><p>! variant-on-marcel_12.scl<br/>!<br/>Expansion of Marcel de Velde&apos;s JI tuning, TL #90805 (9 July 2010)<br/> 12<br/>!<br/> 28/27<br/> 13/12<br/> 7/6<br/> 11/9<br/> 4/3<br/> 13/9<br/> 3/2<br/> 14/9<br/> 13/8<br/> 7/4<br/> 11/6<br/> 2/1</p><p>Something that immediately occurred to me on seeing your set was<br/>Persian shur, which I&apos;ll write with some Persian note notation:</p><p>                               Ap           Bp<br/>                              13/9         13/8<br/>     1/1    13/12   7/6   4/3     3/2  14/9    7/4   2/1<br/>      D      Ep      F     G       A    Bb      C     D</p><p>Here a koron (ASCII p) shows a step lowered by often about a<br/>third of a tone, say 70 cents, although this may vary. In modern<br/>practice, the 13/9 or A-koron (Ap) is a kind of lowered fifth<br/>often favored in passages descending toward the resting note or<br/>final D, the 1/1. While a minor sixth is standard, a small<br/>neutral sixth is favored as a variation in certain modern styles,<br/>so it&apos;s good to have both steps available.</p><p>Interestingly, a tuning of the great philosopher and music<br/>theorist Ibn Sina in the early 11th century has a very similar<br/>pattern, with the second and sixth steps in an alternative<br/>interpretation being 14/13 and 21/13:</p><p>     1/1   13/12  7/6   4/3   3/2  13/8  7/4  2/1</p><p>A fair caution: some leading writers on Persian music say that a<br/>step as small as 63 cents (3/2-14/9, or 28:27) would occur only<br/>as a special ornament, nor as a regular interval in a mode; but<br/>some frettings do seem to show steps not too much larger than<br/>this, around 70-75 cents. I use it often on keyboard, but Iranian<br/>musicians must judge how wisely.</p><p>Now let&apos;s move to the 13/12 step, where we find another mode with<br/>likely Persian affinities, Buzurg, of which Jacques Dudon and I<br/>are alike enamoured:</p><p>     14/13  16/13  4/3  56/39  3/2  21/13   24/13   2/1</p><p>Note that two theorists of the 13th century, Safi al-Din<br/>al-Urmawi and Qutb al-Din al-Shirazi, give the lower fifth as<br/>&quot;Buzurg,&quot; but various upper tetrachords might be used. Here I&apos;ve<br/>given a symmetrical &quot;Buzurg&quot; tetrachord 3/2-21/13-24/13-2/1 with<br/>the steps 14:13-8:7:13:12.</p><p>Another mode you&apos;ll hear a great deal about here, and which<br/>Jacques Dudon has explored over the last almost two decades, is<br/>what he has termed Mohajira, from an Arabic root for &quot;migration.&quot;<br/>On the 1/1 step of the tuning, we have:</p><p>    1/1   13/12  11/9   4/3   3/2   13/8   11/6   2/1<br/>        Z      T      Z     T     Z      T     Z</p><p>A special property of Dudon&apos;s Mohajira is that it alternates<br/>whole tones (T) with Zalzalian or neutral steps (Z), the latter<br/>justly named after the lutenist Mansur Zalzal, who in the 8th<br/>century is said to have introduced a neutral third fret.</p><p>A beautiful variation on this, but with 7/4 here in place of<br/>Dudon&apos;s 16/9, is this:</p><p>    1/1   13/12  11/9   4/3   3/2   13/8   7/4   2/1</p><p>With the 16/9, this would be Jacques&apos; Ibina scale.</p><p>For something with a characteristically Arab flavor, we go back<br/>to the 13/12 step, and find this pleasant version of the<br/>&quot;Arab fundamental scale&quot; used in Maqam Rast, with two tetrachords<br/>each consisting of a whole tone plus a larger and smaller<br/>Zalzalian or neutral second. Note that the simple ratio of 9/8 is<br/>here &quot;virtually tempered&quot; at 44/39, not quite five cents wider:</p><p>     |-----------------|     |--------------------|<br/>    1/1  44/39  16/13 4/3   3/2   22/13  24/13   2/1<br/>     C     D     Ed    F     G      A      Bd     C</p><p>Here ASCII &quot;d&quot; shows an Arab half-flat, which like the Persian<br/>koron actually can vary quite a bit in size but marks a Zalzalian<br/>or neutral interval. In Rast, we generally expect the neutral<br/>third and seventh to be rather on the large size, or somewhat<br/>wider than around 351 and 1053 cents (with ~351 cents equal to<br/>half of a pure 3/2 fifth), here 16/13 and 24/13 at 359 and 1061<br/>cents. This tuning is likely to please lots of Arab tastes, and<br/>to be if anything a bit &quot;low,&quot; but acceptable, to Turkish<br/>tastes.</p><p>If we start this same mode on its 3/2 step -- or the 13/8 step of<br/>the 12-note tuning, then we get another beautiful version of<br/>Rast, here with the fifth &quot;virtually tempered&quot; by not quite five<br/>cents wide at 176/117 (as George Secor once noted, JI tunings I<br/>devise -- or here, as with yours, expand -- often seem to feature<br/>a lot of these ratios):</p><p>     |-----------------|-------------------|<br/>    1/1  44/39  16/13 4/3 176/117 64/39  16/9   2/1<br/>     G     A     Bd    C     D      Ed     F     G</p><p>Here the two Rast tetrachords are conjunct rather than disjunct,<br/>resulting in a minor rather than Zalzalian seventh. This form is<br/>in fact rather similar to al-Farabi&apos;s account of Zalzal&apos;s tuning<br/>for the &apos;oud or lute as reported around the 10th century, but<br/>with the third and sixth a bit higher than that theorist&apos;s 27/22<br/>and 18/11 (355 and 853 cents).</p><p>Thank you again for your scale, and please forgive me for a<br/>rather commonplace 12-note expansion which may be overly<br/>symmetrical by comparison to your original concept. But I did<br/>want to share my enthusiasm.</p><p>With many thanks,</p><p>Margo Schulter<br/>mschulter@...</p></div><h3>Marcel de Velde &#x3C;m.develde@...&#x3E;</h3><span>7/9/2010 8:42:33 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Hello Margo,</p><p>Thanks for your reply!</p><p>It&apos;s amazing to see how much the 11 and 13 derived ratios are common in<br/>arabian music theory.<br/>I had no idea.<br/>And yes, many of those scales do resemble my idea a lot it seems.<br/>Good to be in somewhat in this company, as the microtonal music I enjoy most<br/>up till now is arabian music :)</p><p>Though actually getting this kind of music out of my own scale is still<br/>rather difficult.<br/>At times I feel I&apos;m getting the hang of it.

As I said, still trying to make sense of the function of the<br/>tones.<br/>Btw the scale is sadly 13 tones /oct, not 12 which would have been handy..<br/>One could also add 16/9 if one uses the 1/1 of the harmonic segments (16/9<br/>making the 1/1 of 7/6 11/9 4/3 13/9 14/9) which makes it 14 tones.</p><p>I&apos;ll try to give a more worthy indepth reply to your email soon, bedtime now<br/>:)</p><p>Kind regards,<br/>Marcel</p></div><h3>Marcel de Velde &#x3C;m.develde@...&#x3E;</h3><span>7/9/2010 11:32:14 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Couldn&apos;t sleep and have been thinking and thinking..<br/>This 19th harmonic as the minor third just doesn&apos;t make enough sense to me..<br/>I&apos;ve been there before many many times.

Combining them gives the 7(b9). Since the diminished has the same interval content in all inversions then it is ideal for chord voicing and modulating to different keys with tonics minor thirds apart. Particularly relative major to minor or vice-versa. Eg G7 -&gt; Cma becomes Abdim -&gt; Cmaj becomes G#dim = E7 -&gt; Amin.</p><p>One of its most useful properties is that the tritone between its maj 3rd and b7 degrees descends chromatically if we go through the cycle of fifths, inverting each time. Eg C7 with E-Bb (3rd-7th)-&gt; F7 with Eb-A (7th-3rd) etc...These can then be modified to fit the particular chord progression Eg C7 to Fma7 becomes E-Bb to E-A. We jazz musicians call these *guide tones*. Contrary to old fashioned views of harmony, the fifth is quite dispensable.</p><p>Finally, only the tritone tuned as Sqrt2 gives the 8ve when squared. It is in a manner of speaking a &apos;2 tET&apos;. Only the dim7 tuned to the 4th rt 2 gives the 8ve when multiplied by itself 4 times. It is a &apos;4 tET&apos;.

I think it&apos;s extremely idealistic to believe that there is a one-one correspondence between interval and ratio or that there cannot be a &apos;give&apos; to each interval. Even the slightest temperature change can make an instrument go out of tune in the middle of a performance and the sky doesn&apos;t come crumbling down. The idea that there is something special about the whole-numbers, that they are somehow the &apos;ideal&apos; against which all others are compared, is an old myth going right back to Pythagoras and one which I now suspect has stood in the way of music theory for centuries. (This is made even worse when mathematicians and scientists, who have only a rudimentary understanding of musical harmony, believe that their own explanations are sufficient). As I&apos;ve shown recently, the underlying maths of GCD&apos;s is modelled quite beautifully by the approximate GCD&apos;s of the actual waves themselves. These have all the desirable properties of the integers but with many added advantages. Beats, for eg, are automatically explained by these ~ GCD&apos;s since the operation of subtraction is contained inside that of division (for pure consecutive harmonics the GCD = difference, which translates to ~GCD&apos;s).

But any new tonic chord (major or minor} can follow dim7 chord. So we can modulate to all keys with the help of it. Such progressions can be found in Vivaldi, Bach, Handel... and of course later until Late Romantism. Especially enharmonic-chromatic type of modulation is surprising - great example is in Lacrimosa from Mozart&apos;s Requiem.</p><p>&gt; Particularly relative major to minor or vice-versa. Eg G7 -&gt; Cma &gt; becomes Abdim -&gt; Cmaj becomes G#dim = E7 -&gt; Amin.</p><p>Diminished seventh chord used this way is always on the VIIth grade of the scale in functional harmony (and of course it can precede any grade as borrowed VII7 chord), so before Cmi or C you must use Bdim7 to keep the proper spelling. Abdim must be spelled Ab-Cb-Ebb-Gbb which is not possible in C tonality. If you want to use exactly same notes in C, it must be spelled Ab-B-D-F, which is the last inversion of Bdim7 (B-D-F-Ab).<br/>Which you wrote well in the case of G#dim before Ami.</p><p>&gt;<br/>&gt; One of its most useful properties is that the tritone between its &gt; maj 3rd and b7 degrees descends chromatically if we go through the &gt; cycle of fifths, inverting each time. Eg C7 with E-Bb (3rd-7th)-&gt; &gt; F7 with Eb-A (7th-3rd) etc...These can then be modified to fit the &gt; particular chord progression Eg C7 to Fma7 becomes E-Bb to E-A. We &gt; jazz musicians call these *guide tones*.</p><p>Here you talk about dom7 chord.</p><p>These progressions have been overused since Baroque times, and disused in jazz, so I have experimented many years ago with chains of mi6 chords, which contain also tritone. Guide tones go up in this case, and you get progressions like Fmi6 - Cmi6 - Gmi6 - Dmi6 - Ami6 - Emi6 ...</p><p>And in last years when I want to use chromatically shifted tritone,  I prefer to harmonize it with tritone progression and alternate major and minor chords - like Cmi6 - F#7 - Dmi6 - Ab7.... or C7 - F#mi6 - D7 - G#mi6... Much more interesting.</p><p>&gt; Contrary to old fashioned views of harmony, the fifth is quite &gt; dispensable.</p><p>Which old fashioned? Which period or theory?

But my original point to Marcel was that despite his desire to retune Beethoven to pure JI, his first tuning sounded out because the Opus Drei is full of puns on the ambiguous diminished7 chord which doesn&apos;t suit JI.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;You don&apos;t program it in Scala and compare it to other &apos;tunings&apos; without understanding what it is.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Which as far as I can tell is something you need to work on. This is the tuning list. We are a tough audience, and will not necessarily buy the idea that the diminished seventh chord of common practice harmony has always been, and must and shall forever be, composed of 300 cent minor thirds. Much less that it also must and shall be so in xenharmonic contexts.</p><p>Nonsense. There is only one number that is the fourth root of 2 and all diminished&apos;s will be sufficient approximations to this. The cent value is just an artificial construct. Saying that 2 + 2 = 5 &quot;just because we can&quot; doesn&apos;t make it so. It&apos;s not creative but destructive. OTOH by finding the limits that intervals can be detuned we can at least conceive of a system which might allow 2 + 2 ~ 5. As for being a tough audience, well you improvise a four hour solo gig. I&apos;m not coming from nowhere.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; If we lower any note of a dim 7 chord by a semitone we get a dom 7 chord.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; What&apos;s a &quot;semitone&quot;? 100 cents?</p><p>In this context what else would it be? I was explaining how dim&apos;s are used to substitute for the V7 chord in common western harmony. Understanding traditional harmony is not a &apos;prejudice&apos; to be overcome. As far as I&apos;m concerned it should be a necessary prerequisite.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; It is a &apos;4 tET&apos;. Its harmonic function is totally distinct from the minor chord and only these can be retuned to JI without running into trouble all over the place.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Um, yeah. Of course there are various ways of doing what you claim cannot be done.</p><p>Did I say it cannot be done? No. I might have implied that there is no point in doing it when its done perfectly already.

Nietzsche makes a similar point about philosophers when he says that every philosophy, while they all claim to be *the* most objective theory to date, are merely autobiographies of their author, his own included. Now, now one would doubt that Eulers ID or Totient function are invaluable tools for wave theory in general and musical harmony in particular, but his paper on musical harmony (I forget its Latin title) which attempts to identify chords with LCM&apos;s, is back to front. If we invert his results to time periods instead of freq&apos;s then we get GCD&apos;s of periodic functions. Similarly, while it is standard to derive the harmonic series by applying boundary conditions to the wave equation, a very basic fact that is generally NOT considered is that the same harmonies apply A) between boundary conditions and B) without them. This apparently simple distinction changes the entire view of waves and their place in the scheme of things. This is because boundary conditions are no longer given a priori but can be defined in terms of the class of given wavelengths. IOW it is waves that are a priori and natural, not man-made measuring sticks. Yet most physicists still believe that musical harmony was covered centuries ago by Newtonian mechanics. It is not their equations I doubt but their *interpretation* of them which has been (unconsciously) biased to paint a mechanical &apos;point-particle&apos; view of the universe, contrary to all the evidence.

There are 3 x 4 = 12 diminished chords in 12 tET, 4 x 3 augmented&apos;s etc...It&apos;s also true what you say about 12 music. But my point was also that this 4 is itself a kind of ET and is independent. For eg, in a (albeit very boring musical universe) of 4 tET we would have only 4 keys and 4 intervals + inversions. Therefore trying to retune it to JI is going to destroy that internal logic. Besides, it would be a subset of any ET which is divisible by 4. At any rate, the dim7 chord is very valuable in standard harmony even when its not played. In a basic blues for eg we have the tritone between the maj3 and b7 moving chromatically.</p><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;jlmoriart&quot; &lt;JlMoriart@...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; the diminished has the same interval content in all<br/>&gt; inversions<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; From C to Eb is a minor third, from Eb to Gb is a minor third, from Gb to Bbb is a minor third, but from Bbb to C is an augmented second.

Lowering the other notes gives<br/>&gt; dom7 inversions.<br/>&gt; And it&apos;s almost always connected with lot of enharmonic changes to<br/>&gt; get properly spelled chord.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; Combining them gives the 7(b9).<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Combining what?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; Since the diminished has the same interval content in all inversions<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; ... not true in the score and theory, only on the keyboard or<br/>&gt; fretboard ...<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; then it is ideal for chord voicing<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; ????<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; and modulating to different keys with tonics minor thirds apart.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; This was true maybe for early Baroque when they use it for<br/>&gt; modulations to 8 keys. But any new tonic chord (major or minor} can<br/>&gt; follow dim7 chord. So we can modulate to all keys with the help of<br/>&gt; it. Such progressions can be found in Vivaldi, Bach, Handel... and of<br/>&gt; course later until Late Romantism. Especially enharmonic-chromatic<br/>&gt; type of modulation is surprising - great example is in Lacrimosa from<br/>&gt; Mozart&apos;s Requiem.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; Particularly relative major to minor or vice-versa. Eg G7 -&gt; Cma<br/>&gt; &gt; becomes Abdim -&gt; Cmaj becomes G#dim = E7 -&gt; Amin.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Diminished seventh chord used this way is always on the VIIth grade<br/>&gt; of the scale in functional harmony (and of course it can precede any<br/>&gt; grade as borrowed VII7 chord), so before Cmi or C you must use Bdim7<br/>&gt; to keep the proper spelling. Abdim must be spelled Ab-Cb-Ebb-Gbb<br/>&gt; which is not possible in C tonality. If you want to use exactly same<br/>&gt; notes in C, it must be spelled Ab-B-D-F, which is the last inversion<br/>&gt; of Bdim7 (B-D-F-Ab).<br/>&gt; Which you wrote well in the case of G#dim before Ami.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; One of its most useful properties is that the tritone between its<br/>&gt; &gt; maj 3rd and b7 degrees descends chromatically if we go through the<br/>&gt; &gt; cycle of fifths, inverting each time. Eg C7 with E-Bb (3rd-7th)-&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; F7 with Eb-A (7th-3rd) etc...These can then be modified to fit the<br/>&gt; &gt; particular chord progression Eg C7 to Fma7 becomes E-Bb to E-A. We<br/>&gt; &gt; jazz musicians call these *guide tones*.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Here you talk about dom7 chord.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; These progressions have been overused since Baroque times, and<br/>&gt; disused in jazz, so I have experimented many years ago with chains of<br/>&gt; mi6 chords, which contain also tritone. Guide tones go up in this<br/>&gt; case, and you get progressions like Fmi6 - Cmi6 - Gmi6 - Dmi6 - Ami6<br/>&gt; - Emi6 ...<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; And in last years when I want to use chromatically shifted tritone,<br/>&gt; I prefer to harmonize it with tritone progression and alternate major<br/>&gt; and minor chords - like Cmi6 - F#7 - Dmi6 - Ab7.... or C7 - F#mi6 -<br/>&gt; D7 - G#mi6...
