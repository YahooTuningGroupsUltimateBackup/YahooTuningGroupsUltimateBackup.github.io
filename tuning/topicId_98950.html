In the spreadsheet<br/>I actually have | -1 1 0 0 0 0&gt; because I want to go up to the<br/>13-limit. (Crazy for a novice, right? But Canton is 13-limit, and<br/>that&apos;s what I&apos;m working in right now.)</p><p>I have the 3-limit 12-EDO val: &lt;12 19 |. In the spreadsheet it&apos;s<br/>actually &lt;12 19 28 34 42 44 |, but having the higher numbers there<br/>doesn&apos;t matter when the monzo has zeroes for those primes.</p><p>I generate the homomorphism (&quot;do the mapping&quot;?): (-12)+(19)=7 steps of<br/>12 EDO, or 700 cents. Good. Works for 4/3 = | 2 -1&gt;, 5/4 = | -2 0 1&gt;,<br/>7/6 = | -1 -1 0 1&gt;, and others, using the higher-limit vals.</p><p>Then I start with some commas. The limma = | 8 -5&gt; works (90 cents<br/>mapped to 1 12-EDO step), as does the apotome (114 cents to 1 12-EDO<br/>step), and the Pythagorean (| -19 12&gt; = 23 cents mapped to 0 steps).</p><p>So far, so good.</p><p>But then I get the Porcupine comma, 250/243 or | 1 -5 3&gt;, which is<br/>49.2 cents. That maps to 1 step of 12 EDO: (1*12)+(-5*19)+(3*28) =<br/>12-95+84=1.</p><p>The Magic comma, 3125 / 3072 or | -10 -1 5&gt;, is only 29.6 cents, but<br/>it maps to 1 step of 12 EDO: (-10*12)+(-1*19)+5*28)=-120+-19+140=1.</p><p>Mercator&apos;s comma, | -84 53&gt; is only 3.6 cents, and it gets mapped to<br/>-1 step of 12 EDO. It sure seems like that should be zero. And it gets<br/>mapped to -7 steps of 31 EDO (val &lt;31 49 72 87 107 |, and yes, I know<br/>that&apos;s more places than I need, but it&apos;s irrelevant for what I&apos;m<br/>doing). That just can&apos;t be right.</p><p>Here&apos;s another: Use the monzo for 256/243 = 90.2 cents, or | 8 -5&gt;,<br/>and I see a mapping of &lt;V|M&gt; = 3 steps of 31 EDO, or 116.1 cents. But<br/>two steps is actually closer, at 77.4 cents, than three steps is:<br/>-12.8 cents vs. 25.9 cents.</p><p>The math doesn&apos;t seem complicated, and I even feel like I have an<br/>intuitive grasp for why the mapping should work -- but it seems wrong<br/>to me that 49- and 30-cent commas would map to 1 step of 12 EDO<br/>instead of 0, or why a mapping would prefer a larger difference to a<br/>smaller one.</p><p>In short, I think I must be doing something wrong.

In a temperament, we are mapping prime numbers to numbers that are actually a bit smaller or larger than the primes themselves.  What this means is that error is multiplied in intervals that are composite numbers.  Since the porcupine comma is (2*5*5*5)/(3*3*3*3*3), and in 12-TET those &quot;3&quot;&apos;s are actually 2.996614153753363&apos;s, and those &quot;5&quot;&apos;s are actually 5.039684199579493&apos;s (the 2 is still a 2, though), the more porcupine commas you add together, the more the error gets multiplied.  So in a temperament, we are not mapping every interval to its nearest approximation, we are only mapping the primes to their nearest approximation, and everything else is produced by multiplying these tempered primes together.  Although we can also map primes to intervals that *aren&apos;t* their nearest approximation, too; see below.</p><p>&gt; I can see that 1200 EDO doesn&apos;t support Porcupine -- does that mean<br/>&gt; the same thing as &quot;doesn&apos;t temper the Porcupine comma?&quot; -- because if<br/>&gt; I were just rounding to the closest step I&apos;d round 49.17 cents to 49<br/>&gt; instead of 48 cents! And I&apos;m five cents flat by the time I get to 5<br/>&gt; steps of the Porcupine comma -- in an EDO that should be able to<br/>&gt; always get me within 1 cent of what I&apos;m shooting for.</p><p>First of all, if you&apos;re mapping the Porcupine comma to a non-zero value, you&apos;re not tempering it out.  1200 can support Porcupine, but it requires that you set 49.17 cents equal to 0 cents.  You also have to use a non-optimal mapping of the primes in 1200 to get porcupine temperament out of it, but there&apos;s nothing stopping you from doing that.  I&apos;m not sure what the porcupine val in 1200 would be, exactly, but I&apos;m sure there&apos;s a way to figure it out.</p><p>&gt; I have a vague sense that I&apos;m onto something, but it&apos;s tough to put<br/>&gt; into words. At the very least, I think I understand a process<br/>&gt; differently than I used to: I thought you&apos;d temper a comma out of a<br/>&gt; scale, and then, if you wanted it in an EDO, you&apos;d choose the right<br/>&gt; EDO to put it into. But that&apos;s not really how it works. Instead, you<br/>&gt; take your JI scale as it stands, pick the EDO that tempers the commas<br/>&gt; that you want (and perhaps meets other criteria), and then do the<br/>&gt; mapping of the JI scale into the EDO.</p><p>Right, and the commas will vary with your JI scale.  It helps to lay the scale out as a Fokker periodicity block so that you can see the lattice connecting all the tones.  If you haven&apos;t read it yet, I strongly recommend reading Paul Erlich&apos;s &quot;Middle Path&quot; paper, which can be found here:</p><p><a href="http://eceserv0.ece.wisc.edu/~sethares/paperspdf/Erlich-MiddlePath.pdf">http://eceserv0.ece.wisc.edu/~sethares/paperspdf/Erlich-MiddlePath.pdf</a></p><p>In actuality, you can make any interval into a comma and temper it out, but the simpler the interval, the smaller and less accurate the temperament will become.  A temperament&apos;s accuracy is more or less proportional to the size of its comma, whereas its complexity is proportional to the size of the numerator and denominator of the comma.  For example, 16/15, the Father &quot;comma&quot;, is large (111.73128526977776 cents) but has a small numerator and denominator; this leads to a simple temperament with a large amount of error.  The schismatic comma of 32805/32768, OTOH, is small (1.9537207879341596 cents), but the numerator and denominator are both large; this leads to a complex temperament with a small amount of error.  There&apos;s also interaction between the size of the comma and the size of the numbers in the numerator and denominator, such that a large comma with large numerator and denominator will be more accurate than a comma of roughly the same size but with a small numerator and denominator, because in complex temperaments the error is spread out over a larger chain of intervals.  Likewise, if the complexity is more or less the same between two temperaments but the size of the comma is greater in one, that one will be less accurate.  Meantone and Pelogic temperaments are good examples, because they have the same complexity (more or less), but the Pelogic comma of 135/128 is 92.17871646099708 cents, more than four times the size of the Syntonic comma of 81/80 (21.50628959671478 cents).  This means Pelogic temperaments will be less accurate but have around the same complexity as Meantones.</p><p>Hope this helps!</p><p>-Igs</p></div><h3>Graham Breed &#x3C;gbreed@...&#x3E;</h3><span>5/10/2011 1:27:11 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Jake Freivald &lt;jdfreivald@...&gt; wrote:</p><p>&gt; That part I&apos;ve understood for a while: When we say<br/>&gt; &quot;364/363 vanishes&quot; or &quot;13/11 + 14/11 = 3/2&quot; we&apos;re really<br/>&gt; replacing 2, 3, 7, 11, and/or 13 with other numbers that<br/>&gt; are close to them.</p><p>That&apos;s it!</p><p>&gt; &gt;&gt; you take your JI scale as it stands, pick the EDO that<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt; tempers the commas that you want (and perhaps meets<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt; other criteria), and then do the mapping of the JI<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt; scale into the EDO.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; Yes, that&apos;s it, for tempering *out* the commas.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Super.

However, given a comma (or commas), it *is* possible to find EDOs that temper it out reasonably well.  However, I don&apos;t think anyone&apos;s put together a comprehensive list of all the EDOs of reasonable size that are reasonably psychoacoustically-compatible with all the known temperaments.

Tempering out 25/24, for example, equates 5/4 and 6/5, and also equates 25/16 (as well as 36/25) with 3/2.  This is &quot;dicot&quot; temperament, and is one way of looking at 7-EDO (and also 10-EDO), a temperament in which the main &quot;pun&quot; is that major chords and minor chords are the same thing.  Tempering out 16/15 leads to 5/4 and 4/3 being equated, and this is &quot;father&quot; temperament, and is one way of looking at 8-EDO (you can also do it in 13 and 21 if you use a non-optimal val).  Having one interval that functions as both 4/3 and 5/4 is really wild and xenharmonic.  Then there&apos;s 27/25, the &quot;bug&quot; comma, which equates two 6/5&apos;s (36/25) with 4/3 (36/27).  9-EDO can be looked at this way, as can 14-EDO.  Very simple and very xenharmonic.</p><p>&gt; It sounds like you&apos;re saying that complexity goes up when you have to<br/>&gt; multiply more (distorted) primes together: (2*2*2)/(3*5) is &quot;less<br/>&gt; complicated&quot; than (3*3*3*3*3*3*3*3*5)/(2*2*2*...*2). Is that what<br/>&gt; &quot;complexity&quot; means, or is it a reasonable proxy for it?</p><p>Pretty much, yes.</p><p>&gt; It looks like the more you multiply the distorted primes together to<br/>&gt; get the comma, the smaller the error in the distorted primes can be.<br/>&gt; In a complex comma, the small amount of distortion in the primes gets<br/>&gt; multiplied over and over again, which increases the error enough to<br/>&gt; literally make the comma go away; meanwhile, in a simpler ratio like<br/>&gt; 7/6 or 5/4, the small amount of distortion isn&apos;t multiplied that much,<br/>&gt; so the distorted interval isn&apos;t that different from just.</p><p>Precisely.  Another implication of this is that the &quot;acceptable tuning range&quot; for the generator of a very complex temperament will be much narrower than for a simpler temperament.  You have a range of about +/- 4 cents (692-700 cents) to tune meantone, but to tune schismatic you have only maybe +/- 1 or 2 cents (700-703 cents).</p><p>&gt; It sounds like the &quot;best&quot; commas to temper out, if you want something<br/>&gt; closer to just intonation, are high in complexity and low in<br/>&gt; magnitude. Small-looking ratios might be simpler, but large ones might<br/>&gt; be sweeter.</p><p>Generally-speaking, yes.  But at the same time, the closer you are to JI, the less advantage you actually get from the tempering.  The whole point of tempering is to do as little damage as possible to perceived consonance while reducing the complexity of the system by as *much* as possible.  So the &quot;best&quot; comma would be one that is low in complexity *and* low in magnitude, and it turns out that in the 5-limit, that is unambiguously 81/80.  Srutal/Pajara, Porcupine, Magic, Hanson, Negri, Augmented, and Diminished are the main runners-up (maybe Blackwood, too) in terms of the balance between simplicity and accuracy.  Schismatic, Wuerschmidt, Amity, Tetracot, Orson, and Sensi are probably the main runners-up if we&apos;re willing to let simplicity slide in favor of extreme accuracy.</p><p>As far as EDOs that support these temperaments, Srutal, Porcupine, and Orson are tuned well in 22-EDO; Magic, Hanson, Meantone, Sensi, and Negri are all tuned well in 19-EDO; Augmented and Diminished are both close to optimal in 12-EDO, and Blackwood is done pretty ideally in 15-EDO (which half-asses Porcupine also).  Schismatic doesn&apos;t really show up at all until 29-EDO (which also supports Porcupine and Negri), and really only comes into its own at 41-EDO (which also supports Tetracot and Magic, but is more useful for 7 or 11-limit temperaments).  Amity doesn&apos;t really have a good tuning in anything I&apos;ve looked at from 41 down...maybe 39 but the 5-limit is pretty f&apos;ed up.  Wuerschmidt works pretty well in 31 and 34; 31 also supports Meantone and Orson, while 34 also supports Srutal, Hanson, and Tetracot.</p><p>In the 7-limit...I can&apos;t really go there right now, actually.  The 7-limit is a lot more complicated.  Suffice to say that for extreme accuracy in the 5-limit, 34, 31, 19, and 22 (followed by 29 and 12) are the main contenders, with 19 supporting the largest number of 5-limit temperaments.</p><p>Hope that helps!</p><p>-Igs</p></div><h3>Jake Freivald &#x3C;jdfreivald@...&#x3E;</h3><span>5/10/2011 5:38:40 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Lots of good things here, Igs.</p><p>With respect to puns: I&apos;m mostly noodling with Cantonpenta right now.<br/>I like its sound, and I figure if the whole Western world can devote<br/>most of its energy to 12 EDO then I should be able to at least put<br/>*some* semi-consistent energy into a single scale. :) The major pun in<br/>Cantonpenta is 13/11 + 14/11 = 3/2.

Tempering out 16/15 leads<br/>&gt; to 5/4 and 4/3 being equated, and this is &quot;father&quot; temperament, and is one<br/>&gt; way of looking at 8-EDO (you can also do it in 13 and 21 if you use a<br/>&gt; non-optimal val).  Having one interval that functions as both 4/3 and 5/4 is<br/>&gt; really wild and xenharmonic.  Then there&apos;s 27/25, the &quot;bug&quot; comma, which<br/>&gt; equates two 6/5&apos;s (36/25) with 4/3 (36/27).  9-EDO can be looked at this<br/>&gt; way, as can 14-EDO.  Very simple and very xenharmonic.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt; It sounds like you&apos;re saying that complexity goes up when you have to<br/>&gt;&gt; multiply more (distorted) primes together: (2*2*2)/(3*5) is &quot;less<br/>&gt;&gt; complicated&quot; than (3*3*3*3*3*3*3*3*5)/(2*2*2*...*2). Is that what<br/>&gt;&gt; &quot;complexity&quot; means, or is it a reasonable proxy for it?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Pretty much, yes.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt; It looks like the more you multiply the distorted primes together to<br/>&gt;&gt; get the comma, the smaller the error in the distorted primes can be.<br/>&gt;&gt; In a complex comma, the small amount of distortion in the primes gets<br/>&gt;&gt; multiplied over and over again, which increases the error enough to<br/>&gt;&gt; literally make the comma go away; meanwhile, in a simpler ratio like<br/>&gt;&gt; 7/6 or 5/4, the small amount of distortion isn&apos;t multiplied that much,<br/>&gt;&gt; so the distorted interval isn&apos;t that different from just.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Precisely.  Another implication of this is that the &quot;acceptable tuning<br/>&gt; range&quot; for the generator of a very complex temperament will be much narrower<br/>&gt; than for a simpler temperament.  You have a range of about +/- 4 cents<br/>&gt; (692-700 cents) to tune meantone, but to tune schismatic you have only maybe<br/>&gt; +/- 1 or 2 cents (700-703 cents).<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt; It sounds like the &quot;best&quot; commas to temper out, if you want something<br/>&gt;&gt; closer to just intonation, are high in complexity and low in<br/>&gt;&gt; magnitude. Small-looking ratios might be simpler, but large ones might<br/>&gt;&gt; be sweeter.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Generally-speaking, yes.  But at the same time, the closer you are to JI,<br/>&gt; the less advantage you actually get from the tempering.  The whole point of<br/>&gt; tempering is to do as little damage as possible to perceived consonance<br/>&gt; while reducing the complexity of the system by as *much* as possible.  So<br/>&gt; the &quot;best&quot; comma would be one that is low in complexity *and* low in<br/>&gt; magnitude, and it turns out that in the 5-limit, that is unambiguously<br/>&gt; 81/80.  Srutal/Pajara, Porcupine, Magic, Hanson, Negri, Augmented, and<br/>&gt; Diminished are the main runners-up (maybe Blackwood, too) in terms of the<br/>&gt; balance between simplicity and accuracy.  Schismatic, Wuerschmidt, Amity,<br/>&gt; Tetracot, Orson, and Sensi are probably the main runners-up if we&apos;re willing<br/>&gt; to let simplicity slide in favor of extreme accuracy.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; As far as EDOs that support these temperaments, Srutal, Porcupine, and Orson<br/>&gt; are tuned well in 22-EDO; Magic, Hanson, Meantone, Sensi, and Negri are all<br/>&gt; tuned well in 19-EDO; Augmented and Diminished are both close to optimal in<br/>&gt; 12-EDO, and Blackwood is done pretty ideally in 15-EDO (which half-asses<br/>&gt; Porcupine also).  Schismatic doesn&apos;t really show up at all until 29-EDO<br/>&gt; (which also supports Porcupine and Negri), and really only comes into its<br/>&gt; own at 41-EDO (which also supports Tetracot and Magic, but is more useful<br/>&gt; for 7 or 11-limit temperaments).  Amity doesn&apos;t really have a good tuning in<br/>&gt; anything I&apos;ve looked at from 41 down...maybe 39 but the 5-limit is pretty<br/>&gt; f&apos;ed up.  Wuerschmidt works pretty well in 31 and 34; 31 also supports<br/>&gt; Meantone and Orson, while 34 also supports Srutal, Hanson, and Tetracot.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; In the 7-limit...I can&apos;t really go there right now, actually.  The 7-limit<br/>&gt; is a lot more complicated.  Suffice to say that for extreme accuracy in the<br/>&gt; 5-limit, 34, 31, 19, and 22 (followed by 29 and 12) are the main contenders,<br/>&gt; with 19 supporting the largest number of 5-limit temperaments.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Hope that helps!<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; -Igs<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; ------------------------------------<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; You can configure your subscription by sending an empty email to one<br/>&gt; of these addresses (from the address at which you receive the list):<br/>&gt;   <a href="mailto:tuning-subscribe@yahoogroups.com">tuning-subscribe@yahoogroups.com</a> - join the tuning group.<br/>&gt;   <a href="mailto:tuning-unsubscribe@yahoogroups.com">tuning-unsubscribe@yahoogroups.com</a> - leave the group.<br/>&gt;   <a href="mailto:tuning-nomail@yahoogroups.com">tuning-nomail@yahoogroups.com</a> - turn off mail from the group.<br/>&gt;   <a href="mailto:tuning-digest@yahoogroups.com">tuning-digest@yahoogroups.com</a> - set group to send daily digests.<br/>&gt;   <a href="mailto:tuning-normal@yahoogroups.com">tuning-normal@yahoogroups.com</a> - set group to send individual emails.<br/>&gt;   <a href="mailto:tuning-help@yahoogroups.com">tuning-help@yahoogroups.com</a> - receive general help information.<br/>&gt; Yahoo!
