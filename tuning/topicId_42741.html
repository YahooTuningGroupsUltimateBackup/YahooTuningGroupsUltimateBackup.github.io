I wanted to post a new announcement that several of Couper&apos;s recordings will now be available for streaming download at the Online Archive of California (OAC) at the link below.</p><p>The Library&apos;s Special Collections Department recently acquired the papers of composer and pianist Mildred Couper and is now making the collection available to researchers. Mildred Couper, an American pianist and composer was one of the first composers to experiment with quarter tone music. Couper was born in Buenos Aires in 1887 and lived in Europe as a child until her family emigrated to the United States in 1915 at the outbreak of WWI. She taught piano at the Mannes School in New York for several years and then moved to California in 1927. After establishing her studio in Santa Barbara she started writing quarter-tone music. Her first work in this medium was a ballet, &quot;Xanadu,&quot; which was performed in the production of Eugene O&apos;Neill&apos;s &quot;Marco Millions&quot; in the Lobero Theatre in 1930. Scores to three of Mildred Coupers quarter tone works, the &quot;Dirge,&quot; for violin and piano, &quot;Rumba,&quot; for two pianos, &quot;Xanadu,&quot; for two pianos are now online and are available for research and study. Audio files of the &quot;Dirge,&quot; &quot;Rumba&quot; and &quot;Prelude to Anacapa&quot; are also available online. Couper&apos;s papers are housed in the Department of Special Collections.</p><p>For further information visit <a href="http://www.library.ucsb.edu/speccoll/pa/pamss45.html">http://www.library.ucsb.edu/speccoll/pa/pamss45.html</a>.
