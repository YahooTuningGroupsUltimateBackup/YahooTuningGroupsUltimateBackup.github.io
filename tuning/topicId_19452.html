(!!)  In other words,<br/>&gt; if somebody was looking for APPROXIMATIONS of just intervals, one is<br/>&gt; dealing with a TET.  If one INTENTIONALLY wanted a system that divided<br/>&gt; up the octave with NO REGARD for any pure intervals, and wanted the<br/>&gt; resulting sounds, one is dealing with an EDO.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; It&apos;s pretty much &quot;humbug,&quot; isn&apos;t it....  I wonder if it should have a<br/>&gt; prominent place in the FAQ, or not at all.  Besides, as Dan Stearns<br/>&gt; quickly pointed out, EDO doesn&apos;t do too very well for scales that have<br/>&gt; no octaves!  (Like Bohlen-Pierce, of course...)</p><p>Gary and Joe,</p><p>As far as I ever knew, there was never any difference of definition between t-ET and EDO except<br/>that the latter is more explicit.</p><p>The usefulness of the term EDO is that it does distinguish Equal Divisions of the Octave from Equal<br/>Divisions of anything else.  If the Bohlen-Pierce scale didn&apos;t have a formal name, what would you<br/>call it?  13 t-ET?  It is, you know.  &quot;13 tone equal temperament&quot; could mean steps of virtually any<br/>size at all, depending what IoE (interval of equivalence) was being equally divided 13 times.<br/>Since the octave is by far the most common IoE, the term EDO clarifies the meaning, distinguishing<br/>it from divisions of some other interval, such as the 3:1 of Bohlen-Pierce&apos;s 13 ED 3:1.  So if a<br/>non-octave IoE is being used for an ET, you simply replace the &quot;O&quot; with it.</p><p>Most of the time it&apos;s not necessary to be so precise; most of us tend to assume octave equivalence<br/>most of the time.  But now and again the subject of non-octave IoEs comes up and then things get<br/>confusing if you don&apos;t have some simple way of distinguishing between them.  That&apos;s why I have<br/>tried to consistently use EDO instead of t-ET any time the context doesn&apos;t already make it clear.</p><p>BTW, EDO should include stretched octaves, IMO.  (That&apos;s kind of a funny sentence, isn&apos;t it?)  Any<br/>interval near enough to 2:1 to be heard, and to function, as an octave should be counted as an<br/>octave for purposes of classifying ETs, right?</p><p>and wacth that dang speling and capitalzation, would ya?!!  :)</p><p>--<br/>David J.
