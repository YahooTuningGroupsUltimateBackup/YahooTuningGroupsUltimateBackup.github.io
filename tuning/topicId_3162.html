On that album is a snippet of Monteverdi&apos;s &quot;1610 Vespers&quot; complete<br/>with cheesy prehistoric synthesized voices. I thought it was way cool so I<br/>went back to ye olde record shoppe and got a recording of the original work<br/>performed by human beans. Wore that out and became a lifelong worshipper of<br/>Monteverdi. Have any of the faithful considered that a cheesy Partch<br/>rendition by a slick high profile group like the Kronos might in the end<br/>increase sales of Enclosures et al?</p><p>Sarn says:</p><p>Well, has anybody heard of a session musical peice called &quot;Popcorn&quot;<br/>by a Jazz band called &quot;Hot Buttered&quot;?</p></div>
