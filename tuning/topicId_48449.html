This is the &apos;consistency&apos; issue i&apos;ve been harping on for over<br/>six years now.</p><p>&gt; but<br/>&gt; I&apos;ll post a list of the 8ve repeating scales for 43 soon, as part<br/>of my<br/>&gt; studies into scale patterns. Being a prime EDO, every difference<br/>&gt; between pitch-classes is a generator, so there&apos;s quite an<br/>interesting<br/>&gt; selection out there.</p><p>non-prime EDO suffer no paucity in this regard -- many temperaments<br/>such ETs belong to simply turn out to have a period which is 1/2 or<br/>1/3 or 1/4 . . . octave instead of 1 octave. For example meantone<br/>derives from 81:80 (the syntonic comma) vanishing, but if you have<br/>2048:2025 (the diaschisma) vanish instead, you end up with a period<br/>of 1/2 octave and the diaschismic family of scales that includes 10,<br/>12, 22, 34, etc. Then if you dislike the &apos;atonal&apos; or &apos;polytonal&apos; feel<br/>of the most obvious scales derived in this way, simply make some<br/>chromatic alterations and you end up with something less ambiguous-<br/>sounding -- and sometimes even omnitetrachordal!</p></div>
