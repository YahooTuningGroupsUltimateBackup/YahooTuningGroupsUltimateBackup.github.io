So for 9-limit or higher consonant<br/>chords, you will find that the best approximations of the just<br/>consonances don&apos;t always fit together into semblances of the just<br/>chords you expect them to.</p><p>&gt; I know 7/4 is a bit<br/>&gt; off, but I just wondered if there were any tolerances on 7/4 to<br/>&gt; indicate if 973.9&cent; was &apos;close enough&apos;?</p><p>it&apos;s of course a function of context, duration, timbre, loudness,<br/>etc., but yes, absolutely. it&apos;s with ratios of 9 that you begin to<br/>get into ambiguities in 43-equal.</p><p>&gt; Anyone used 43EDO at all - not just as a meantone?</p><p>yes, i&apos;ve used it as an &apos;escapade&apos; tuning -- actually what i was<br/>using was every other note of 43-equal, so it repeats every 2<br/>octaves . . .</p></div><h3>Mark Gould &#x3C;mark.gould@argonet.co.uk&#x3E;</h3><span>11/13/2003 2:02:43 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Hi guys for the bits and pieces. I did think that 9-limit (as a meantone 43 confounds 9/8 10/9 so there would be problems there), but I&apos;ll post a list of the 8ve repeating scales for 43 soon, as part of my studies into scale patterns.

This is the &apos;consistency&apos; issue i&apos;ve been harping on for over<br/>six years now.</p><p>&gt; but<br/>&gt; I&apos;ll post a list of the 8ve repeating scales for 43 soon, as part<br/>of my<br/>&gt; studies into scale patterns. Being a prime EDO, every difference<br/>&gt; between pitch-classes is a generator, so there&apos;s quite an<br/>interesting<br/>&gt; selection out there.</p><p>non-prime EDO suffer no paucity in this regard -- many temperaments<br/>such ETs belong to simply turn out to have a period which is 1/2 or<br/>1/3 or 1/4 . . . octave instead of 1 octave. For example meantone<br/>derives from 81:80 (the syntonic comma) vanishing, but if you have<br/>2048:2025 (the diaschisma) vanish instead, you end up with a period<br/>of 1/2 octave and the diaschismic family of scales that includes 10,<br/>12, 22, 34, etc. Then if you dislike the &apos;atonal&apos; or &apos;polytonal&apos; feel<br/>of the most obvious scales derived in this way, simply make some<br/>chromatic alterations and you end up with something less ambiguous-<br/>sounding -- and sometimes even omnitetrachordal!</p></div>
