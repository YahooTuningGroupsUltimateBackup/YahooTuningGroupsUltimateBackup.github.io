I remember all<br/>the times that I would read that this or that tuning was unbearably<br/>discordant (13-tET for example) or whatnot, and perhaps only good for<br/>this or that limited application, only to later find that this seemed<br/>to be much more the case in the somewhat &apos;amusically&apos; distorted vacuum<br/>of isolated listening... I&apos;m all for listening experiments, and trying<br/>to learn and decipher what we can learn and decipher from them, but I<br/>guess I for one am much more comfortable with the idea of letting<br/>actual music resolve these kinds of issues.</p><p>Dan</p></div>
