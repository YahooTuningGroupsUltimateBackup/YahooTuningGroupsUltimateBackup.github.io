My personal opinion (based<br/>only on my own understanding and intuitive feel of what I&apos;ve seen so<br/>far) is that I sincerely doubt that the evidence (as it stands) could<br/>really be called much more than an educated guess - and not that<br/>that&apos;s chopped liver mind you(!), but it is definitely different from<br/>saying that this was Ives&apos; intent.</p><p>Ives left a lot of implications in the &quot;things he didn&apos;t get to&quot; by<br/>way of the things that he actually did get to, and I guess that the<br/>question here is whether it&apos;s really the best idea to present this as<br/>Ives&apos; own intent, or as an extrapolated reading of what only *might*<br/>have been his intent... As far as I&apos;m concerned these are tough and<br/>tangled issues, and on the one hand I like Johnny&apos;s  approach of<br/>rolling up his sleeves and diving right in and getting things done,<br/>but I also question why it is (based on what&apos;s been presented) that<br/>this has to be heralded as something like &quot;Ives intent&quot; and not simply<br/>as Johnny&apos;s (keen) read on what might have been. Maybe these are just<br/>differences in temperament and really amount to little more than a<br/>different spin on the semantics of the presentation, I don&apos;t know...<br/>but I do think that ideas like this are pretty hard to shake if they<br/>start to accumulate a certain kind of momentum and that it is probably<br/>wise (or perhaps respectful, though I suppose there&apos;s an argument that<br/>goes the other way) to error on the side of caution... and I really<br/>see no reason why that kind of caution should in anyway impede (or<br/>diminish) the overall endeavor here.</p><p>&gt;So, by this argument, one is perhaps not only &quot;finishing&quot; the<br/>Universe Symphony, but also &quot;finishing&quot; Ives implied tuning theory! --<br/>this is perhaps not historically verifiable, but is certainly a very<br/>interesting interpretation (which is probably why Sterns wants to hear<br/>it himself!!).</p><p>Well I&apos;m actually totally against the idea of &quot;finishing&quot; Ives&apos;<br/>&quot;implied tuning theory&quot; based on what&apos;s I&apos;ve seen, heard, or read so<br/>far.{1} But at the same time I really am all for (even selfishly)<br/>interesting interpretations, as I really do love the music and would<br/>like to see more (and not less) of it.</p><p>&gt;All this would lead to the view that Charles Ives is fundamentally a<br/>microtonal composer, in all his works, not just the &quot;experimental&quot;<br/>ones --</p><p>That seems like an awfully big leap to me.</p><p>&gt;an idea I wouldn&apos;t have accepted initially, but which seems to be<br/>gaining more and more credence the more I think about it...</p><p>The more I&apos;ve thought about it the more I seem to like the idea also<br/>but the less I believe that it will be &quot;proven&quot; to be so, as he<br/>himself just seems to have left as much to nay-say it by as he did to<br/>extrapolate it from... But never say never: Has the (often mentioned)<br/>technical plan of the _Memos_, &quot;see typewritten copy sent to Bellamann<br/>of technical plan etc. of Sonata, with tone-vibration tables<br/>etc.)--the difference in its overtonal beats (actually measured<br/>vibrationally),&quot; ever turned up anywhere, or does anybody know whether<br/>it was ever published or more thoroughly cited elsewhere?</p><p>Dan<br/>_____________________<br/>{1} Same goes for the Universe as well. To my mind the Universe has<br/>got to be at least as all encompassing, stunning, and &quot;Ivesian&quot; as the<br/>Fourth, and (again, to my mind) those are some mighty big shoes to<br/>fill... It was with that sense of expectation that I rushed into the<br/>Austin version, and that same unjustified and no doubt unrealistically<br/>distorted sense of expectation also threw me into a sullen week long<br/>funk after hearing it (once I came to see it as Larry Austin and not<br/>Charles Ives, everything settled into a better perspective). I add<br/>this not as any sort of cautionary note or whatnot -- because I&apos;m<br/>pretty sure that my own Ives influences probably wouldn&apos;t seem up to<br/>par to me if it weren&apos;t for the fact that it is me listening to me(!)<br/>either -- I just include it as it&apos;s the way it went down... Is it a<br/>better idea to finish Charles Ives&apos; Universe Symphony or to let the<br/>implications of the &quot;things he didn&apos;t get to&quot; resonate the best one<br/>can in their own work... I guess that&apos;s for each to say and everyone<br/>else to critique!</p></div><h3><a id=6778 href="#6778">ðŸ”—</a>Afmmjr@xxx.xxx</h3><span>12/8/1999 7:59:05 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Dear Dan,</p><p>I will try to respond to you as gently as I know how because I am coming to<br/>understand your position with greater clarity.  It has helped me focus as<br/>well, though Intonation will only be a single chapter in my latest project.<br/>Today Joe Pehrson and I spoke and if I can remember some of the points, they<br/>might make a bit more sense to the subject.</p><p>1.  Like a movie you haven&apos;t seen, you can&apos;t critique what I did to finish<br/>the &quot;Universe   Symphony&quot; because you have never experienced it.  And that&apos;s<br/>why I&apos;m writing a   book to explain how it was done.<br/>2.  I am only a single person that has stated his views.  If you respond to<br/>every   single post with the same response, that no one has &quot;proved&quot; one<br/>thing or    another, all I can do is agree.  I will work to tie it all<br/>together like a great trial     lawyer.   Maybe you&apos;ll even wish me luck.<br/>3.  There is a lot of falsity and cover up associated with Ives and my work<br/>is in the   opposite direction.  A different interpretation is exactly what<br/>is needed.  Catch   your breath and let the evidence unravel, or have I been<br/>too slow to post?<br/>4.  There is an intuitive level to why I believe so strongly in the<br/>interpretation of Ives  thinking in extended Pythagorean.  It comes from<br/>concentration on performing     many different works of Ives, gradually<br/>noticing how the sounds are intesified by   the intonation honoring the<br/>implications I have outlined.  It&apos;s not enough by itself    to intuit a<br/>truth, but it is a step on the way of being sure.<br/>5.  Charles Ives had no control with intonation in his performances.  He<br/>could barely    get a performance and didn&apos;t hear most of his mature work.<br/>How do you imagine  he could ask for intonation subtlety?  It was only for<br/>prosperity, in the published    scores that he put his foot down.  He<br/>anticipated that people will make sense of  his sketches.  His vocabulary is<br/>antiquated and idiosyncratic but it does makes  sense, subject to<br/>interpretation.<br/>6.  Again, this is why I write a book:  Austin&apos;s version was Austin, but why<br/>should  that have any bearing on my work at all?  None, there&apos;s nothing in<br/>common, at  least nothing noticeable.</p><p>Dan, and all those that want certitude, stay tuned and give me a little<br/>breathing room and I&apos;ll give it a try.  (Joe Monzo - I will get to the<br/>eighthtones soon..I&apos;m doing finals right now...should be able to clarify<br/>soon.  BTW, The use of eighthtones in the &quot;Unverse Symphony&quot; is a whole 12<br/>seconds.)</p><p>Johnny Reinhard<br/>AFMM</p></div><h3><a id=6780 href="#6780">ðŸ”—</a>D.Stearns &#x3C;stearns@xxxxxxx.xxxx&#x3E;</h3><span>12/9/1999 12:11:35 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>[Johnny Reinhard:]<br/>&gt;1.

Charles Ives had no control with intonation in his performances.  He<br/>&gt;could barely    get a performance and didn&apos;t hear most of his mature work.<br/>&gt;How do you imagine  he could ask for intonation subtlety?  It was only for<br/>&gt;prosperity, in the published    scores that he put his foot down.</p><p>Here is a composer who asked that a pair of pianos be tuned a quarter step<br/>apart, who asked that a board be cut for proper performance of clusters,<br/>who asked that an instrumentalist walk around the auditorium, who required<br/>multiple conductors, who frequently wrote pieces of fiendish difficulty --<br/>even by today&apos;s standards, unplayable to many by the standards of his day.<br/>If there ever was a composer who was uncompromising, who refused to dilute<br/>his vision for the sake of playability, Charles Ives was it! I cannot<br/>believe that he would not ask the piano to be retuned for performances of<br/>the Concord if it was central to his artistic vision.</p><p>It could be that the various bits in the Memos and other sources that<br/>Johnny mentions show another side to the argument, but it may also be that<br/>Ives saw Pythagorean basis of scales in theory but accepted temperament in<br/>practice. One can notate something one way because of a theoretical<br/>underpinning without having it reflect actual practice or sound. For<br/>example, if a chromatic piece of the late Baroque has both a D# and an Eb<br/>notated within it, should we conclude that the composer must have wanted<br/>split keys or at least saw them as an ideal? Not necessarily -- the<br/>spelling of accidentals can also depend on the preferred spelling of the<br/>chord (by thirds) and the melodic motion (avoiding augmented/diminished<br/>intervals). We shouldn&apos;t assume a tuning preference based on that evidence<br/>alone.</p><p>I don&apos;t think the case is closed on Ives&apos;s tuning, and I am very interested<br/>to see a publication with all of the evidence laid out. Also, I would<br/>definitely like to hear performances in the proposed tunings.</p><p>Bill</p><p>^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^<br/>^ Bill Alves                                      email: <a href="mailto:alves@hmc.edu">alves@hmc.edu</a> ^<br/>^ Harvey Mudd College                 URL: <a href="http://www2.hmc.edu/~alves/">http://www2.hmc.edu/~alves/</a> ^<br/>^ 301 E.

It was published sans microtones.<br/>Charles Ives was much more disrespected.</p><p>Ives was called deficient by William Austin in his influential book &quot;20th<br/>Century Music,&quot; and called unprofessional by The New York Times because he<br/>made money outside of music making.  When he is not declared a crank, or a<br/>manic-depressive, or homoerotic (Stuart Feder), he&apos;s a liar (Maynard<br/>Solomon).</p><p>Aaron Copland determined that Ives&apos;s worst compositional problem is that he<br/>couldn&apos;t edit himself.  This problem was due, in Copland&apos;s published<br/>estimation, to his having no relationships with other musicians and so did<br/>not have the necessary feedback for which to make editing determinations.<br/>Past Ives Society President J. Peter Burkholder consider most all scholarship<br/>on Ives before 1974 revisionist, while some serious musicologists consider<br/>the Ives Society an &quot;Anti-Ives Society.&quot;</p><p>With a legacy such as this, I am working to research the full subject.  It<br/>was never my intention to becomes a Charles Ives specialist.  I had thought<br/>for sure that, except for a few pieces with notated quartertones, Ives&apos;s<br/>music was conventional in conception.  Obviously, I now feel differently.</p><p>I do not think Ives, the man who did indeed make a lot of things happen<br/>through money and persistance (not necessarily in that order) had the<br/>opportunity to get his subtle tuning ideas across to other people.  Yes, the<br/>Concord Sonata is intended for a 12-TET piano in the short term.  But the<br/>Idea goes beyond that, thanks to Ives&apos;s explicit memos, and is now perfectly<br/>realizeable.  This is a case of the composer asking for assistance after he<br/>is gone.  And recent AFMM performances follow his careful instructions<br/>clearly to make a difference.  The intonation difference is subtle, but<br/>musicians are sensitive to an improvement when comparing a<br/>conventionally-tuned performance of the &quot;Unanswered Question&quot; with the AFMM<br/>performance of 10/11/99.</p><p>I ask you to consider, or reconsider, the &quot;Concord&quot; from a semantic point of<br/>view.  Ives was making portraits of individuals that were all<br/>&quot;transcendental&quot; thinkers and had lived in historic Concord.  These are deep<br/>individuals that students continue to struggle with...Emerson, Thoreau.  So<br/>Ives does a psycho-portraiture and requires a deeper meaning in the music<br/>through the intonation so as to discern and underscore the greater meaning<br/>that Ives hopes to imbue in his subjects.  The music is made all that more<br/>profound for its intonational aspirations.</p><p>An interesting Concordism is the flute tune in the Thoreau, said to be a<br/>further tribute to the philosopher, who also played flute, and may have<br/>actually initiated the entire music project.  On a CD there&apos;s no problem, but<br/>live?  Did Kirkpatrick use a flute in his famous early performance?  I don&apos;t<br/>think so.  Anyone know otherwise?</p><p>Now everyone does it.  Pianist Paul Kim is performing the &quot;Concord&quot; this<br/>Friday at New York&apos;s Third Street Music School Settlement (235 E. 11th<br/>Street) at 7:30 P.M., admission free.  He&apos;s a colleague at C.W. Post, with a<br/>brilliant reputation.  This is my first chance to hear him.  His young son<br/>Matthew is playing the flute solo.</p><p>When it came to discussing intonation, Charles Ives might as well have spoken<br/>a different language to musicians.  They barely spoke to him and they usually<br/>didn&apos;t like his music.  His few interactions with conductors were practically<br/>all failures (Slonimsky and Harrison the exceptions).  I think the issue of<br/>intonation was a more private concern (a family predilection and a secret),<br/>perhaps like his spirtual beliefs.  It is only now that material is coming<br/>forward, just like with Harry Partch.</p><p>I do believe that when all of Ives&apos;s consistant comments about intonation are<br/>matched up with performances of his music, his music will be perceived as all<br/>the more  awesome. Ives&apos;s mind was awesome and his music bears this out<br/>independently of what anyone could ever write about him.  He is the<br/>proverbial man ahead of his time.  I bet he realized it.</p><p>Johnny Reinhard<br/>AFMM</p></div><h3><a id=6820 href="#6820">ðŸ”—</a>D.Stearns &#x3C;stearns@xxxxxxx.xxxx&#x3E;</h3><span>12/10/1999 2:12:17 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>[Bill Alves:]<br/>&gt;One can notate something one way because of a theoretical<br/>underpinning without having it reflect actual practice or sound.</p><p>I think a lot of the late song (or at least those marked with a later<br/>dating) are just calling out for a real analytical analysis along<br/>these lines... and while I feel I have the passion and the patience<br/>for the job, I also totally lack a background (i.e., no musical<br/>education) that would make me a reasonable candidate for the it...
