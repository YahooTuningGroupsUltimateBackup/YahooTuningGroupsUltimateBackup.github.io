(If Tosi really had understood, or taken as important,<br/>any system that has differently sized Ut-Re vs Re-Mi, or Fa-Sol vs<br/>Sol-La, as shown in Galliard&apos;s plate 1, wouldn&apos;t he have found some<br/>way to say so?  But no, Tosi&apos;s pedagogical focus for melodic scale<br/>intonation was only on semitones, not any distinction between two<br/>differently-sized *tones* that a student or teacher should take pains<br/>to understand, hear, or perform.)</p><p>It&apos;s perhaps important that we keep some chronology in mind here.<br/>Tosi wasn&apos;t around anymore to offer an opinion about the translation<br/>or explication of his work.</p><p>1723 Tosi&apos;s Italian original is published, with Tosi aged 68 or 69,<br/>as an essay of the wisdom from his long career as teacher.  And his<br/>book is written to teachers, not directly to students; it&apos;s about how<br/>to *teach* the musical principles important to fine musicianship.</p><p>1732 Tosi dies, aged 87 or 88.</p><p>1742 Galliard and his publisher Wilcox issue their English<br/>translation, and it goes into at least a 1743 second edition as well.</p><p>1757 Agricola does a published German translation.</p><p>1774 there is a French translation.</p><p>1967 Galliard&apos;s English version is republished in London.</p><p>=====</p><p>Translators and reviewers screwing up by incorrectly amplifying the<br/>source they&apos;re reporting upon, or inserting their own competing<br/>premises into it, consciously/deliberately or not?  It happens.</p><p>The most recent example of this that I&apos;ve seen is the review of Ross<br/>Duffin&apos;s book that is published in the current issue of _Early<br/>Music_.  The reviewer, who really should know better and who<br/>shouldn&apos;t use straw-man arguments against the piece he&apos;s reviewing,<br/>mistakenly attributes to (and affirms/congratulates!) Duffin and his<br/>book something that Duffin not only didn&apos;t say, but which is also<br/>technically wrong about the 55-division system and its reason for<br/>being.  The reviewer asserts that the 55-division has two different<br/>types of tones, of 9 commas and 8 commas, which are somehow supposed<br/>to correspond to (or approximate) the 9:8 and 10:9 tones making up a<br/>5:4 in just intonation.  And that&apos;s poppycock, for several reasons:</p><p>- The 8-comma &quot;tone&quot; in the 55-division is not even a musical tone at<br/>all, for use in any tonal music, but rather it would be a doubly-<br/>augmented unison (such as stepping directly from Ab to A#).</p><p>- The 9-comma tone in the 55-division is not some approximation of<br/>*either* the 9:8 or 10:9.  It&apos;s its own thing.  It&apos;s an all-purpose<br/>tone, of uniform size for all occasions.  It happens to split an 18-<br/>comma major 3rd exactly down the middle, but that doesn&apos;t have<br/>anything to do with a 5:4 interval either.</p><p>- If things are being made up about the existence of some 8-comma<br/>tone (and blamed upon Duffin, which is silly!), shouldn&apos;t things also<br/>be made up about a 10-comma tone?  An example would be G# to Bb, 10<br/>commas.  That&apos;s not a tone.  It&apos;s a diminished minor 3rd.  Unlike the<br/>8-comma chimera, this one might actually come up (albeit rarely) in<br/>18th century music, but the context isn&apos;t diatonic motion in any<br/>normal scale.  It&apos;s something like a Neapolitan cadence into A minor:<br/>D-D-F-Bb, E-B-E-G#, A-C-E-A.  Top voice takes a 10-comma step down<br/>from Bb to G#, and then a five-comma step up to A.  But again, this<br/>has nothing to do with a 9:8, 10:9, or 5:4 interval, none of which<br/>exist (or are even approximated) in the 55-division system.</p><p>Well, here&apos;s what that paragraph says in the review, in all its<br/>splendor mis-representing Duffin&apos;s book, and mis-representing the 55-<br/>division, along with a patronizing tone against Duffin (both in this<br/>paragraph, and even more so elsewhere in the review):</p><p>&quot;Although Duffin presents an interesting and useful selection of<br/>historical evidence, I find his attitude to the historical material<br/>is insufficiently critical and that this lack of discrimination<br/>undermines even his main conclusion and advice to musicians.  His<br/>main claim rests on an already historical misinterpretation of the<br/>division of the octave into 55 equal parts, an equal temperament of<br/>55 steps (55-ET: Duffin calls it &apos;extended meantone&apos;, because of<br/>certain resemblances to a variant of standard meantone temperament).<br/>The older music theory defined a chromatic semitone as comprising<br/>four &apos;commas&apos; and the (larger) diatonic semitone as comprising five.<br/>The octave, containing seven diatonic semitones and five chromatic<br/>ones, must then consist of 55 commas, and Duffin correctly points out<br/>that two different whole tones result: a major whole tone (ratio 9:8)<br/>comprising nine &apos;commas&apos;, and a minor whole tone (10:9) consisting of<br/>eight such commas.  Both whole tones together form the pure major<br/>3rd, 5:4, so crucial for harmony.&quot;  (_Early Music_ August 2007, p453,<br/>left column)</p><p>Make up something that directly DISAGREES with the model being<br/>presented, congratulate the book&apos;s author on something he DIDN&apos;T say<br/>about the model, mis-represent the model itself as having an aim<br/>incompatible with itself, and then accuse the book&apos;s author of being<br/>insufficiently critical with the material?
