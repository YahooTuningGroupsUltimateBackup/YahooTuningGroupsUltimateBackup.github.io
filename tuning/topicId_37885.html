Sometimes one<br/>philosophizes about JI as well....the resonance of straight rational numbers.<br/> The numbers are minimally complex.  They are not that hard I couldn&apos;t have<br/>learned as much as I did.  Most of the numbers come easy to me because I hear<br/>the interval first and then I use the numbers for verbal or written<br/>description.  The more variations of third one gets, and sometimes the<br/>differences between one temperament and another, or even between like<br/>intervals in the same well temperament, are only cents apart.  That&apos;s the big<br/>difference between 700 cents and 702 cents.  Who says they can&apos;t hear this<br/>difference?</p><p>But it is the qualitative that seems missing from discussion.  All the JI<br/>people likely could do it justice, but prefer not to.  Perhaps because I do<br/>use JI along with a treasure trove of other tunings in my compositions I an<br/>at least shine light on the issue.  The quality of Just Intonation includes a<br/>belief in the quality of the hierarchical relationships, which temperament<br/>weakens.  The JI locking is like musical truth and bares poorly temperament<br/>under conditions of loudness, sustain, and resonance.

My continuously demonstrating my pitch<br/>acuity on the radio and to the top people in the tuning field would surely<br/>have backfired on me by now if it was shoddier than I thought it was, don&apos;t<br/>you think?  Bob, have you tried the Li Po Songs to know what is involved<br/>intonationally?  Could your world theories of music include people who hear<br/>with more acuity than you do?  And if, If, I could hear better than a cent,<br/>wouldn&apos;t that be a good skill for someone who spends a lifetime producing<br/>microtonal concerts, exclusively?  Sorry, sports, I can&apos;t prove it to you<br/>over the Internet.  If you guys want to attack me because you don&apos;t like my<br/>point of views, it will be severely disappointing.

Just<br/>pressing near-just buttons for notes doesn&apos;t capture what is in fact just.  I<br/>say this as a polymicrotonal composer, one who uses just only in combination<br/>with other tunings.

I am in<br/>some ways a purist, and have been heavily dumped on more than a few<br/>times for it. However, as Gene Smith so cogently pointed out, there<br/>is always a limit to precision.</p><p>GET THIS, ALL YOU NON-TECHNICAL PEOPLE OUT THERE!!!!! THERE IS A<br/>LIMIT TO PRECISION!!!!! IN PRINCIPLE (meaning not just practically,<br/>but fundamentally), you cannot make screw threads, cylinders and<br/>pistons, radio frequencies, musical pitches, or any other humanly<br/>manufactured physical component or system, or their musical or non-<br/>musical products, infinitely precise.</p><p>THERE IS ALWAYS SOME LEVEL OF TOLERANCE, HOWEVER SMALL. The tolerance<br/>can never be zero.</p><p>THE TOLERANCE CAN NEVER BE ZERO!!!!!!!! Even the earth&apos;s orbit and<br/>rate of rotation change enough so we have to track it in order to<br/>keep our atomic clocks synchronized with the actual solar time of<br/>day.</p><p>The point of these simple, really simple and, by all rights, self-<br/>evident truths is:</p><p>ALL THIS TALK OF NO COMPROMISE IS PURE, UNMITIGATED NONSENSE!!!</p><p>THERE IS ALWAYS COMPROMISE!!! NO ONE CAN CHANGE OR HELP THAT!!!</p><p>The only question is how much is the tolerance for error? Two cents,<br/>one cent, 0.1 cents, 0.001 cents? There is a limit even in terms of<br/>what we can physically implement with electronic equipment, although<br/>the tolerance is vanishingly small. But the human ear&apos;s tolerance is<br/>quite a bit bigger than what is vanishingly small in today&apos;s<br/>electronic technology, which is capable of using atomic oscillators<br/>and frequency counters/dividers to achieve the most amazing<br/>precision.</p><p>So I just don&apos;t think it matters much after a certain point. Pardon<br/>me, I KNOW it doesn&apos;t matter AT ALL after a certain point, and the<br/>point is not on the order of 0.01 cents. The human ear will call<br/>just, ANY HUMAN EAR WILL CALL JUST, a pitch that is 0.1 cents off.<br/>How much bigger is a matter of debate, but the tolerance IS IN FACT<br/>BIGGER THAN THAT!!!!</p><p>Acoustic instruments such as a harp or piano using physical systems<br/>to calibrate and maintain pitch cannot reliably hold within 0.1 cents<br/>through an entire hour of playing. Many can&apos;t even hold within one<br/>whole cent through an hour of playing.</p><p>So let&apos;s get real, folks, and STOP PRETENDING THERE IS SUCH A THING<br/>AS ZERO-TOLERANCE JI!!! And don&apos;t feel sad about that! It really<br/>doesn&apos;t matter one little bit!!! The celestial purity that I am so<br/>intensely fond of in JI is not compromised one gnat&apos;s hair by an<br/>error of 0.1 cents. Anyone who thinks it is not well connected with<br/>either physical or musical reality. The only question is how much<br/>bigger can we make this number and still be right about that<br/>statement.</p><p>Respectfully,</p><p>Bob</p></div><h3>jonszanto &#x3C;JSZANTO@ADNC.COM&#x3E;</h3><span>6/20/2002 1:27:32 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Bob,</p><p>--- In tuning@y..., &quot;robert_wendell&quot; &lt;rwendell@c...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt; GET THIS, ALL YOU NON-TECHNICAL PEOPLE OUT THERE!!!!!</p><p>...and the rest.

How we hear it is still another matter.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; best, Johnny Reinhard</p><p>Bob:<br/>I read George Secor&apos;s recent post about his experience with Irv<br/>Wilson&apos;s keyboard playing on the perfectly stacked scale all geared<br/>integrally to the system clock. I was inspired by it! That is indeed<br/>the only way I know of to achieve what we should consider to be<br/>EFFECTIVELY zero-tolerance JI. This just confirms what Julie Werntz<br/>would probably consider my fundamentalism.</p><p>Notwithstanding hers and others&apos; disdain, it makes sense to me that<br/>something so perfectly and powerfully coherent would have that<br/>effect. Look at laser beams, after all. That&apos;s why they are so<br/>powerfully important. They are powerfully coherent sources of a<br/>particular kind of very useful energy. I think of JI as musically<br/>analagous, and when perceived by the human ear and processed by human<br/>consciousness, it has the power to move the innermost soul of<br/>whatever constitutes our humanity and quite likely to increase the<br/>coherence with which our minds function.</p><p>My talk of compromise, however, has to do with our focus, yours and<br/>mine, on humanly driven acoustic tuning systems. I agree, especially<br/>in light of this experience of George Secor&apos;s, that we should do the<br/>best we can to increase the precision of our JI, if we wish use it. I<br/>just think that we shouldn&apos;t croak at sub-3-cent errors in<br/>temperaments that work as practical finite models of JI. Once we have<br/>our puzzle worked out and in place, there is nothing wrong with<br/>tweaking it to perfection if we can, in terms of JI. We singers and<br/>string players and others do that all the time anyway, in the context<br/>of music that is conceptually based on 12 notes per octave.</p><p>Cheers,</p><p>Bob</p><p>But I have been talking</p></div><h3>Kraig Grady &#x3C;kraiggrady@anaphoria.com&#x3E;</h3><span>6/20/2002 3:45:05 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>THERE IS NO REASON TO HAVE COMPROMISE IN INTENT ;-)<br/>jpehrson2 wrote:</p><p>&gt; --- In tuning@y..., &quot;robert_wendell&quot; &lt;rwendell@c...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; <a href="http://groups.yahoo.com/group/tuning/message/38021">http://groups.yahoo.com/group/tuning/message/38021</a><br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; ALL THIS TALK OF NO COMPROMISE IS PURE, UNMITIGATED NONSENSE!!!<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; THERE IS ALWAYS COMPROMISE!!!

Will those who are inclined to such things have to once again hide from those<br/>&quot;possessed&quot; by the spirits of  the witch hunters of Mass. The archetypes have ways of appearing in<br/>the best disguises and logic and reason have.<br/>    I will say i consider music in general Sacred being an expression of the spirit and soul with<br/>in us. An exhalation that cannot be contained.<br/>    I understand that now we can point to where god is with the brain. Let me caution<br/>my fellow beings on this globe that repressing such an area will only cause it to manifest in more<br/>and more infantile if not violent manifestations on large scales.<br/>     I have just reread James Hillman&apos;s Article on &quot;terrorism&quot; written in 1983. It contains<br/>interesting quote by Henri Corbin<br/>    &quot; What is wrong with the Islamic World is that it has destroyed its images, and without these<br/>images that are so rich and full of tradition, they are going crazy because they have no<br/>containers for their Extraordinary imaginative power.&quot;<br/>    On another scale we are probably not far behind.</p><p>dkeenanuqnetau wrote:</p><p>&gt; --- In tuning@y..., Kraig Grady &lt;kraiggrady@a...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt; &gt; Must you insist on doing nothing but secularizing every sacred<br/>&gt; object there is.<br/>&gt; &gt; but the humorous furor really seems to becoming more, from the<br/>&gt; opposite side<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I&apos;m sorry Kraig. I don&apos;t mean to cause you pain. But I think you&apos;ve<br/>&gt; really put your finger on something here. Perhaps you, and many<br/>&gt; others, are unwilling to admit to _any_ acceptable tuning tolerance<br/>&gt; (despite being forced to accept them in real life) because it<br/>&gt; threatens something sacred.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I personally have found that truly sacred things do not vanish if I<br/>&gt; examine them closely.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; To express my view on this, I can do no better than to quote the<br/>&gt; philosopher Daniel Dennett.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &quot;There is no future in a sacred myth. Why not? Because of our<br/>&gt; curiosity. Because ... _we_want_to_know_why_. ... Whatever we hold<br/>&gt; precious, we cannot protect it from our curiosity, because being who<br/>&gt; we are, one of the things we deem precious is the truth. Our love of<br/>&gt; truth is surely a central element in the meaning we find in our lives.<br/>&gt; In any case, the idea that we might preserve meaning by kidding<br/>&gt; ourselves is a more pessimistic, more nihilistic idea than I for one<br/>&gt; can stomach. If that were the best that could be done, I would<br/>&gt; conclude that nothing mattered after all.&quot;<br/>&gt;</p><p>-- Kraig Grady<br/>North American Embassy of Anaphoria island<br/> <a href="http://www.anaphoria.com">http://www.anaphoria.com</a></p><p>The Wandering Medicine Show<br/>Wed. 8-9 KXLU 88.9 fm</p></div><h3>francois_laferriere &#x3C;francois.laferriere@oxymel.com&#x3E;</h3><span>6/24/2002 1:44:50 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In tuning@y..., &quot;emotionaljourney22&quot; &lt;paul@s...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt; as for tuning the strings an octave lower, i don&apos;t know how much<br/>&gt; experience you have tuning pianos, but that would leave you with a<br/>&gt; musically useless tone. the strings are just way too floppy at that<br/>&gt; tension. mind you, it is stiffness (which has to do with the<br/>&gt; composition of the string, its mounting, etc.) that causes<br/>&gt; inharmonicity, not tension. perhaps francois can remind us of the<br/>&gt; formula relating these quantities?</p><p>The partial ar raised according to</p><p>f(n) = n * f(0) * sqrt ( 1 + B * n^2 ) ;</p><p>where B is the inharmonicity factor</p><p>B = ( pi^3 * Q * d^4 )/ ( 64 * l^2 * T )</p><p>where</p><p>Q = Young elasticity module of the string<br/>d = diameter of the string<br/>l = length of the string<br/>T = tension</p><p>So everything being equal, inharmonicity goes down as length of string<br/>increase (in fact even more, because to keep the same pitch, T must<br/>increase as well as f goes up as sqrt(T) / l ).
