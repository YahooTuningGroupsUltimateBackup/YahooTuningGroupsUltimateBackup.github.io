Now, into the breach :-)</p><p>&gt; I do not want to sound offensive in any way shape or form towards David<br/>&gt; Cope, and indeed, I found his books on EXPERIMENTS ON MUSICAL<br/>&gt; INTELLIGENCE,<br/>&gt; about the exploits on SARA so interesting, that I went and brought both<br/>&gt; books, the sequel, and the origional, however, I have one grudge<br/>&gt; about SARA.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; This algorithm,-It is, what, -correct me if I&apos;m wrong, they call<br/>&gt; &quot;parasitic&quot;, parasitic in the sence that it used fragments of music<br/>&gt; precomposed by a human and then mixes them up.</p><p>Well, EMI and SARA are a bit more complex than that. You have the books, as<br/>do I. If you&apos;re not a LISP aficionado, you&apos;ll find them difficult reading,<br/>since much of the important detail is in the code. Also, if you don&apos;t have a<br/>Macintosh, the CD that comes with the more recent book cannot be read. A<br/>pity, since I have two LISP environments for my Windows box and would love<br/>to port this code and play with it.</p><p>[snip]</p><p>&gt; So, how do we define a TRUELY artificially intelligent algorithm<br/>&gt; for making<br/>&gt; music, music that would fool an audience?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Is this a valid argument?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; A sound argument?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; You&apos;re thoughts please.</p><p>Well ... I&apos;ve heard the music produced by Cope&apos;s scheme. It is pleasant<br/>enough, but it just doesn&apos;t have the spark that Bach, Mozart, Beethoven,<br/>Chopin, Scott Joplin and Stravinsky have. It&apos;s a better imitation of them<br/>than, say, Illiac Suite is of Palestrina, but it still is an imitation.</p><p>Would it fool an audience? Probably not, even people who didn&apos;t know all of<br/>Beethoven&apos;s sonatas, for example.<br/>--<br/>M.
