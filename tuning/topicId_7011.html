I must say, the<br/>tape swap has some great pieces, and the denoising by Cool Edit 2000 is<br/>amazing. If any of you tape swappers want, I will send your mp3ified piece<br/>to you as an email attachment. I still have not found my program notes, so<br/>if you want me to attach your piece, please tell me its number on the<br/>tape.</p><p>It is so cool that Dante Rosati got his page up. This brings to 8 the<br/>number of <a href="http://mp3.com">mp3.com</a> pages with conciously microtonal content, by my<br/>reckoning.</p><p>BTW, the Tuning Punks are now more easily accessed at<br/><a href="http://mp3.com/thetuningpunks">mp3.com/thetuningpunks</a></p><p>John Starrett<br/><a href="http://www-math.cudenver.edu/~jstarret/microtone.html">http://www-math.cudenver.edu/~jstarret/microtone.html</a></p></div>
