Yes, I&apos;d be glad if you can find the audio track examples. (continued...)</p><p>Hmmm, this one wasn&apos;t easy, but I found it:</p><p><a href="http://tinyurl.com/dvc3d">http://tinyurl.com/dvc3d</a></p><p>Keyboard magazine no longer has their archives online, so thank goodness for the Wayback Machine. The above link is an article from Dec 2000 profiling composer James Newton Howard, and I believe it gives a lot of insight into how one needs to shape electronic tools to reflect humanistic playing styles. I&apos;m not saying his way is the only way, but it certainly is an illustrative look at someone who brings this off quite well.</p><p>Since you asked about equipment, note his list at the end of the article. To see just how egregious this can get, note the number in parenthesis after his mention of the Roland S-760 Sampler - (28). Yes, indeed, at this time he had 28 of those suckers in his rack!</p><p>Unfortunately, the two example files aren&apos;t online, but I may have them on one of my older machines archived. If you are interested, I&apos;ll look for them...</p><p>Cheers,<br/>Jon</p><p>----------</p><p>So, it is all about pumping the expression pedal as one makes a live midi recording. I have one such pedal which I tend to use. So far so good.</p><p>It also seems that he shuns quantization of liquiescent instrumental parts such as violins and oboes.</p><p>Velocity-switched layers for different sound characteristics emanating from the same instrument is an awfully good idea, which I think must  be implemented and integrated with notation software of the next decade.</p><p>For example, I surmise that at least four or five velocity/expression layers for a grand piano sample is necessary to emphasize various nuances between ppp and fff.</p><p>It is a shame that the MIDI sustain pedal just operates as an ON/OFF switch. In acoustical pianos, the amount of release of dampers critically affects sound output.</p><p>I don&apos;t understand the zippering part though. Distortion and White Noise, on the other hand, are a big nuisance in the electronic medium. Is there no way of cutting out the white noise without ruining the waveform?</p><p>It is also a grand idea to channel all bare instrumental parts to a single effects processor. However, the processor must be very professional (and expensive).</p><p>It all boils down to the best sample libraries available, which evidently cost a small fortune.</p><p>And the way Howard uses different string ensemble samples to double the already written parts just shows that you can never always get the most realistic sample on the first try.</p><p>Let us simplify that list however:</p><p>(1) Integrated DAT/CD/DVD 24-bit multiple-layer recorder<br/>(1 pair) Quality flat-speaker monitors with integrated amplification<br/>(1) PowerMac laptop (MacOs latest) with Pro Tools and other stuff installed<br/>(1) All-in-One Compact Mixer Console with Integrated Aural Effects and Dynamic Processors (Expandable)<br/>(1) Realistic 88-Key Grand-action Piano Keyboard &amp; Expandable Synth with On-Board Mega-Sampler Device + Vienna Symphonic Library etc...</p><p>Of course, all of these must be microtonal-friendly.</p><p>I think this much is quite enough. It&apos;s all a matter of locating the dream items and obtaining a price.</p><p>Cordially,<br/>Ozan</p><p>  ----- Original Message -----<br/>  From: Jon Szanto<br/>  To: <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a><br/>  Sent: 16 May&imath;s 2005 Pazartesi 6:40<br/>  Subject: [tuning] Re: Constant shifting of key</p><p>  Hi Ozan,</p><p>  --- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;Ozan Yarman&quot; &lt;ozanyarman@s...&gt; wrote:<br/>  &gt; Dear Jon, what is the minimal list of electronic equipment and<br/>  software required to produce this &quot;shockingly-close to reality&quot;<br/>  microtonal-orchestral performance? A price tag included will be most<br/>  appreciated.</p><p>  I&apos;m sorry, that isn&apos;t quite possible. Usually, this amounts to &quot;the<br/>  sky is the limit&quot;. When I&apos;ve got more time I can post a couple of past<br/>  links (if they are still good) that gave examples of a couple people<br/>  who do this that were quite illustrative.</p><p>  But you know what? A lot of it has to do with 2 things:</p><p>  1. Using your ears (and I *don&apos;t* mean that facetiously!)<br/>  2. Understanding the thing you are trying to replicate</p><p>  This kind of answer that I&apos;m giving will probably be frustrating, but<br/>  the above 2 elements can lead you in quite a number of different<br/>  directions. For example, some of the articles I&apos;ve posted in the past<br/>  (mostly on MMM, I&apos;m afraid) were dealing with hardware synthesizers.<br/>  As anyone who frequents MMM knows, we&apos;re going through a fairly large<br/>  shift in electronic music right now from hardware to software. I don&apos;t<br/>  mean to imply that hardware synths will be replaced by soft, but that<br/>  there are now alternatives that are more cost - and space - effective.</p><p>  If you concentrate only on point #2 above, one could think about Tom&apos;s<br/>  comment: that an entire violin section can&apos;t _musically_ be emulated<br/>  by one line or pass through a synth. [Please note that while I am<br/>  using the term &quot;synth&quot;, you could substitute any sound generation<br/>  device, for example Gene uses soundfonts frequently]. If you were to<br/>  record a number of passes of the same violin line, with slightly<br/>  differing velocities, attacks, aftertouch, etc, you come closer to<br/>  mixing the infinite variety of nuances (and fallicies!) happening at<br/>  any time in a violin section.</p><p>  I fear I might babble too much, and that the tuning list might not be<br/>  the appropriate forum. But some composers I know have been able to get<br/>  good orchestral simulations using a small number of samplers layered<br/>  with other instruments, while big-time Hollywood types have racks and<br/>  racks of these. The bottom line is listening to your result, and<br/>  spending time trying to build in the phrasings and nuances of the type<br/>  ensemble you are attempting to represent. Taking a basic midi file and<br/>  dumping it through a generalised instrument, even with a little<br/>  processing, is probably going to yield lesser results.</p><p>  Two last things:</p><p>  1. Trying to recreate orchestral/classical stuff isn&apos;t the only way to<br/>  go, and Gene has done other stuff with the same tools that I like.</p><p>  2. I haven&apos;t even mentioned the next hurdle - doing all this<br/>  convincingly *and* making it microtonal!</p><p>  Cheers,<br/>  Jon</p></div><h3><a id=58614 href="#58614">ðŸ”—</a>Jon Szanto &#x3C;jszanto@cox.net&#x3E;</h3><span>5/17/2005 12:49:14 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Hi Ozan,</p><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;Ozan Yarman&quot; &lt;ozanyarman@s...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt; Thanks for providing the link below.

And what&apos;s more, a guitar-based approach to microtonality is not terribly attractive to the likes of me. I would rather imagine huge orchestras (symphonic fasil) playing maqam polyphony the way I conceive, with every darn microtone of Huzzam, Saba, Usshaq, Nihavend, and Allah knows what else, all theoretically formulated and grounded to the utmost limit in concrete notation.</p><p>Since I do not imagine that Berlin or New York Philarmonic Orchestras will any time soon start practicing microtones, I will stick to the sampling technology.</p><p>If it is a matter of midi tuning realistic samples, then we are still on-topic.</p><p>Cordially,<br/>Ozan</p></div>
