The objective should be<br/>to provide 8:7 supertones and 21:21 semitones in the melody, which<br/>give more definite progressions than 10:9 and 16:15.  Also, 6:7:9<br/>subminor triads give a more otonal, and sometimes stable, sound than<br/>10:12:15.  14:18:21 supermajor triads can be used where a major triad<br/>would function as a dissonance.  Progression by wolf-fourths in the<br/>bass should be avoided, at least in a diatonic context.</p><p>&gt; Is there a non-drone, non-blues theory<br/>&gt; of 7-limit that describes a body of<br/>&gt; music? I suspect that some of the<br/>&gt; meantone theory dealing with augmented<br/>&gt; intervals would be as close to a place<br/>&gt; to start as any. I don&apos;t think a<br/>&gt; similar extension even to 9 occurs.</p><p>I don&apos;t know about &quot;theory of music&quot; but a lot of the same ideas would<br/>occur.  Like resolving dissonances on to consonances, and stepwise<br/>descending resolution.  I think 7-limit intervals can be admitted as<br/>consonances, the 11-identity remain useful dissonances.  9 depends on<br/>context.  A lot of counterpoint can be moves straight across.<br/>Vicentino&apos;s 5-limit chords with (implicit) 11-limit melody is also<br/>worth a look.</p><p>Another idea: getting the right inversions is more important as the<br/>limit rises.</p><p>I was getting somewhere with the neutral third scales.  The<br/>characteristic dissonances are Bv-F, D-Av and D-F (which is a 6:5<br/>approximation in meantone-like scales, but dissonant in 41 and 72).<br/>That leaves C-Ev-G as the obvious tonic and Bv-D-F-Av the obvious<br/>chord to resolve onto it.  Bv-D-F could also resolve to Av-C-Ev and<br/>D-F-Av to Ev-G-Bb.  These same progressions could be played in Miracle<br/>tuning, but the sense of a neutral triad being stable, and defining<br/>the neutral third scale, would be lost.</p><p>&gt; Beats me, rant over, keep composing and<br/>&gt; theorizing out there.</p><p>The important theory will come when people get hands-on experience of<br/>the tuning.  So far, I&apos;ve found that a 7:9:11 approximation works well<br/>resolving downwards to a 5-limit chord.  I&apos;m sure there&apos;s lots of<br/>stuff like this waiting to be discovered.  And load of chords that<br/>only work in the temperament, like neutral triads and the 0-3-5-8<br/>chord.</p><p>             Graham</p></div><h3>monz &#x3C;joemonz@yahoo.com&#x3E;</h3><span>5/14/2001 6:18:41 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In tuning@y..., Robert C Valentine &lt;BVAL@I...&gt; wrote:</p><p><a href="http://groups.yahoo.com/group/tuning/message/22726">http://groups.yahoo.com/group/tuning/message/22726</a></p><p>&gt; ...
