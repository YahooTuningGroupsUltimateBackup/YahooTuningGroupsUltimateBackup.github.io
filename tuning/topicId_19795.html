Microtonality and paucitonality: a short answer<br/>----------------------------------------------------</p><p>If asked &quot;What is microtonality,&quot; members of the Tuning List might<br/>offer definitions taking at least three general approaches, all of<br/>them with delicate and often controversial cultural implications:</p><p>(1) MICROTONALITY AS THE USE OF &quot;SMALL&quot; INTERVALS. In the most obvious<br/>definition, microtonality (from Greek _mikro_, &quot;small&quot;) is the use of<br/>intervals smaller than the usual whole-tones and semitones of the<br/>best-known Western European compositional traditions, although the use<br/>of such intervals is a routine feature of many world musics.</p><p>(2) MICROTONALITY AS THE USE OF &quot;UNUSUAL&quot; INTERVALS OR TUNINGS. In a<br/>second and related definition broadening the first, microtonality is<br/>the use of any interval or tuning system deemed &quot;unusual&quot; or<br/>&quot;different&quot; in a given cultural setting -- in many 20th-21st century<br/>settings, for example, just about any tuning for keyboard or guitar<br/>other than a division of the octave into 12 equal semitones (12-tone<br/>equal temperament, or 12-tET). The composer Ivor Darreg&apos;s concept of<br/>_xenharmonics_, which it is tempting to describe in a paraphrase of<br/>the Latin poet Terence as the conviction that &quot;nothing intonational is<br/>alien to me,&quot; seems synonymous with this sense of &quot;microtonal.&quot;</p><p>(3) MICROTONALITY AS A MUSICAL CONTINUUM OR DIMENSION. In a third<br/>definition, microtonality is simply the dimension or continuum of<br/>variation among intervals and tuning systems, embracing _all_ musics.</p><p>Seen from another perspective, the first two definitions treating<br/>&quot;microtonality&quot; as a special and often suspect category of music imply<br/>an unspoken norm of what we might term _paucitonality_, literally &quot;few<br/>tones&quot; -- or better, &quot;scarce tones.&quot; This concept also invites at<br/>least three definitions:</p><p>(1) PAUCITONALITY AS CULTURAL MYOPIA. In its root definition,<br/>paucitonality or &quot;scarce-tonedness&quot; is a state of musical and cultural<br/>myopia in which the use of intervals and intonational nuances<br/>routinely occurring in many world musical traditions -- including some<br/>European ones -- must be relegated to a special &quot;microtonal&quot; category.</p><p>(2) PAUCITONALITY AS INTONATIONAL MONOMANIA. In its more aggravated<br/>forms, paucitonality could be defined as an ideology (often unspoken)<br/>restricting musicians (at least in theory) to a single tuning system,<br/>and viewing talented musicians even of one&apos;s own historical or<br/>cultural tradition who dare to propose something &quot;different&quot; as<br/>&quot;straying far afield from the mainstream.&quot;</p><p>(3) PAUCITONALITY AS THE ABSENCE OF CHOICE. In its third definition,<br/>corresponding to the definition of &quot;microtonality&quot; as a universal<br/>property of all music, paucitonality means tuning by default, or by a<br/>decision not to decide, rather than by informed and aware choice.</p><p>As the first two definitions of &quot;microtonality&quot; or &quot;paucitonality&quot; may<br/>suggest, defining certain intervals as &quot;unusual&quot; can have witting or<br/>unwitting cultural implications, especially when the definition of<br/>&quot;usual&quot; is based on one subset of European composed music. The less<br/>pleasant overtones -- to use a musical figure of speech -- sometimes<br/>get articulated all too plainly.</p><p>In his &quot;A Brief History of Microtonality in the Twentieth Century&quot;[1],<br/>self-proclaimed microtonalist Brian McLaren tells how a German<br/>theorist named Willi von Moellendorf experimented with one of the<br/>popular early 20th-century tuning systems: 24-tone equal temperament<br/>(24-tET). Taking as a starting point the 12-tET system which had then<br/>just recently become the norm in Europe for keyboards, 24-tET divides<br/>each of the 12-tET semitones into two &quot;quartertones.&quot;</p><p>Often very mistakenly equated with &quot;microtonality&quot; in general, the<br/>24-tET system is simply one equal division of the octave among a<br/>myriad of equal and unequal divisions, not to speak of nonoctave<br/>tunings. In fact, many self-declared microtonalists today might regard<br/>it as a rather conservative and overworked choice, although others<br/>find it charming and exciting, especially when applied to certain less<br/>familiar styles.</p><p>In 1917, however, von Moellendorf had to confront not only the usual<br/>objections to any musical innovation, but also the charge that<br/>intervals such as quartertones represent a &quot;primitive, even barbaric<br/>condition of a lower cultural level.&quot; Given subsequent history in<br/>Germany and elsewhere in Europe during the years 1933-1945, such<br/>possible cultural implications may have an interest more than<br/>musical.[2]</p><p>Indeed the word &quot;barbaric,&quot; another Greek-derived term, may say much<br/>about the concept of &quot;microtonal&quot; as applied by &quot;antimicrotonalists&quot;<br/>or &quot;paucitonalists.&quot; To the ancient Greeks, the speech of outsiders<br/>sounded like a meaningless &quot;bar-bar,&quot; thus the term &quot;barbarian,&quot; one<br/>outside the &quot;civilized&quot; world.</p><p>To &quot;antimicrotonalists&quot; (some of whom might define themselves simply<br/>as &quot;lovers of _normal_ music&quot;), similarly, musics based on unfamiliar<br/>intervals or tuning systems sound like &quot;mistunings&quot; or &quot;random<br/>dissonance.&quot; Such judgments would relegate not only self-consciously<br/>experimental or avant-garde composed musics, but age-old musics of a<br/>vast range of world traditions, to an &quot;inferior&quot; (or at best &quot;exotic&quot;)<br/>status.</p><p>It is against this backdrop of &quot;intonational politics&quot; that champions<br/>of intonational pluralism -- &quot;microtonality&quot; in definition (3) --<br/>consider such issues as &quot;Should I call myself a microtonalist, a<br/>xenharmonicist, an alternative tuning advocate, or simply a musician?&quot;</p><p>People hesitating to embrace the &quot;microtonal&quot; label, or even actively<br/>resisting it, often take the principled stand: &quot;My music is an<br/>integral whole, with intonation simply one aspect of this whole: I<br/>leave others to make categorizations.&quot;</p><p>Other musicians, ranging from Nicola Vicentino (1511-1576) to many<br/>members of this Tuning List, eagerly embrace terms such as<br/>&quot;microtonal&quot; (or earlier historical equivalents such as &quot;enharmonic,&quot;<br/>see Section $$2.1 below) because they see new intervals and tuning<br/>systems as a central theme of their music.</p><p>Also, musicians may embrace the term &quot;microtonal&quot; as an act of<br/>affirmation and solidarity in the face of intonational oppression: &quot;If<br/>that&apos;s what the &apos;mainstream&apos; scene wants to call us and our music,<br/>let&apos;s make the most of it.&quot;</p><p>Our third definition of microtonal as a universal but not universally<br/>recognized aspect of all music may be one way of reconciling these<br/>viewpoints. The decision (active, passive, or unknowing) to use _any_<br/>tuning system places a musician somewhere on the microtonal continuum,<br/>or within the microtonal multiverse.</p><p>From this perspective, to declare that one is a &quot;microtonalist&quot; is<br/>simply to acknowledge this reality, and to invite others to join in<br/>this musical act of self-awareness and mutual celebration.</p><p>------------------------------------------------<br/>$.2. A longer answer: perspectives and paradoxes<br/>------------------------------------------------</p><p>Since both microtonality and paucitonality may be concepts of most<br/>relevance to composed European traditions, questions of how best to<br/>define them may be implicitly ethnocentric, distracting us from a more<br/>balanced survey of the use of intervals both large and small in a<br/>plethora of world cultures through the millennia.</p><p>Nevertheless, examining a few historical examples and patterns may<br/>suggest the perennial nature of some European and related issues of<br/>microtonality/paucitonality, and also bring out some of the paradoxes<br/>inherent in definitions sometimes more often cited (on this Tuning<br/>List and elsewhere) than carefully examined.</p><p>One 20th-21st century factor which may transform the debate for better<br/>or for worse is technology. On the positive side, electronic means<br/>both of recording and of synthesizing musical sounds have created a<br/>basis for free cultural interchange and mutual knowledge, and also for<br/>realizing just about any known or not-yet-conceived tuning system, and<br/>for quickly switching a keyboard or similar instrument from one system<br/>to another.</p><p>On the negative side, mass production can mean mass standardization of<br/>the most confining kind, threatening to produce what composer and<br/>historian Douglas Leedy has described as &quot;an unsavory echo of<br/>imperialism&quot; subjecting the &quot;musical cultures of the world&quot; to a<br/>process of &quot;control and appropriation.&quot;[3]</p><p>Despite these vital technological changes, a journey to the Europe of<br/>five centuries ago may reveal how many microtonal/paucitonal issues<br/>are not so new in substance.</p><p>--------------------------------------------------------<br/>$.2.1. Microtonality/paucitonality and &quot;small&quot; intervals<br/>--------------------------------------------------------</p><p>In 1482, the often iconoclastic Spanish musician and theorist<br/>Bartolome Ramos published a treatise noted then and now both for its<br/>daring innovations, intonational and otherwise, and for its biting<br/>satire against the musical &quot;establishment&quot; of the time. Both aspects<br/>of his work led to heated controversies.</p><p>Discussing the art of finding regular intervals on a keyboard likely<br/>tuned in the new meantone fashion then coming into vogue, Ramos<br/>considered an interesting question: might a 12-note tuning more<br/>usefully include G# or Ab, two distinct notes often differing in<br/>Renaissance meantone temperaments by around a fifth of a tone.</p><p>After considering the arguments and opting for Ab, Ramos added that<br/>some people prefer to satisfy both sides of the question by designing<br/>a keyboard with both accidentals -- typically by splitting the key for<br/>an accidental so that pressing the front portion would sound G#, for<br/>example, while the back portion would sound Ab. This approach was<br/>followed, for example, in the organ at Lucca in Italy with such split<br/>keys for G#/Ab and Eb/D#, providing 14 notes in each octave, and<br/>enjoyed widespread favor in 16th-17th century Europe.</p><p>Ramos, however, raises the objection that having both Ab and G# would<br/>introduce an interval not part of the diatonic order -- the interval<br/>smaller than a semitone between these two notes. Showing the<br/>Renaissance love for Classic allusions and precedents, Ramos cited the<br/>case of a musician banished from Sparta for the &quot;crime&quot; of adding<br/>extra strings to his instrument beyond those accepted by tradition,<br/>thus upsetting the musical and political order.</p><p>Although Ramos adds that nevertheless there are good arguments for<br/>having both G# and Ab which he reserves for another discussion (this<br/>discussion is not known in his writings which have come down to us),<br/>his allusion to Spartan paucitonalism may reflect a cultural theme<br/>still quite relevant in the year 2001, as artists facing the<br/>professional consequences of &quot;microtonality&quot; can attest.</p><p>Moving ahead in time to the year 1555, we find composer and theorist<br/>Nicola Vicentino publishing his great work on _Ancient Music Adapted<br/>to Modern Practice_. By a happy coincidence, in one popular flavor of<br/>meantone tuning with pure or near-pure major thirds, the diesis or<br/>small interval by which accidentals such as G# or Ab differ happened<br/>to be around the same size as the enharmonic diesis of ancient Greek<br/>theory. Vicentino made the most of this by seeking, as his title<br/>suggested, to combine the expressive enharmonic genus of the Greeks<br/>with 16th-century techniques of polyphony and counterpoint.</p><p>Masterfully analyzing the &quot;common practice&quot; of the time as well as<br/>documenting his own experimental music, Vicentino described his<br/>_archicembalo_ or &quot;superharpsichord&quot; dividing the octave into 31<br/>dieses, each equal to 1/5-tone. In 1561, he advertised his similar<br/>_arciorgano_ or &quot;superorgan,&quot; sounding a notable cross-cultural theme.</p><p>With this instrument, he announced, one could perform &quot;all manner of<br/>songs and airs according to the idiom which all the nations of the<br/>world sing&quot; -- including, for example, the Spanish, French, Polish,<br/>English, Turkish, and Hebrew manners.[4]</p><p>Given the special interest of the Renaissance in fitting music to a<br/>text elegantly and expressively, this passage could be read to suggest<br/>an interest both in the melodic intervals and nuances favored by other<br/>cultures, and in the most flexible choice of intervals by a composer<br/>in setting poetic or other texts in a range of world languages.</p><p>Along with 16th-century enharmonicists -- or xenharmonicists, to use a<br/>more recent term -- there were also the &quot;anti-enharmonicists,&quot; among<br/>them the otherwise often outspokenly radical musician Vincenzo<br/>Galilei, father of the astronomer Galileo.</p><p>In Galileo&apos;s view, Vicentino&apos;s enharmonic dieses were &quot;contrary to the<br/>nature of singing and disproportionate to our sense of hearing.&quot;[5]</p><p>As his comments on Vicentino and his students revealed, such matters<br/>could be issues of economics as well as theoretical psychoacoustics.<br/>According to Galilei, Vicentino&apos;s disciples found it necessary to<br/>abandon the enharmonic style in order to succeed in the marketplace.</p><p>Many xenharmonicists of today may also hear a familiar if not so<br/>pleasant ring in another view of Galilei, an accomplished lute player<br/>as well as composer and polemicist: his ridicule of lutenists favoring<br/>the use of _tastini_ or &quot;little frets&quot; added to the instrument in<br/>order to obtain purer thirds.</p><p>In 1584, while meantone tunings with pure or near-pure thirds were<br/>standard on keyboards, 12-tET was standard on fretted instruments such<br/>as the lute; but then as now, some players favored alternative or<br/>modified frettings. Galilei seems to be describing a kind of just<br/>intonation scheme or the like adding special frets to the usual ones.</p><p>Poking fun at such players when the strive for pure thirds but find<br/>that their fingers stumble into impure fifths or fourths, showing that<br/>their ears are not as fastidious as one might have guessed, Galilei<br/>adds that a truly expert performer (such as himself!) needs no such<br/>special gadgets to impress an audience, thus assuming the 16th-century<br/>role of the author as self-promoter.</p><p>For Galilei, both Vicentino&apos;s enharmonic music and the just intonation<br/>lute frettings represented the use of intervals smaller than a<br/>diatonic or chromatic semitone -- a concept closely coinciding with<br/>the most familiar definition of &quot;microtonalism.&quot; His reaction was not<br/>favorable.</p><p>Galilei&apos;s views as a musician who felt free to question authority on<br/>many points, and to challenge the conventional rules of counterpoint<br/>and dissonance treatment, are of special interest.</p><p>To advocate Nicola Vicentino&apos;s enharmonicism, or Ivor Darreg&apos;s<br/>xenharmonicism -- a difference of only one letter -- is to take a<br/>stand which may carry an appreciable professional price.</p><p>------------------------------<br/>$.2.1.1. How small is &quot;small&quot;?<br/>------------------------------</p><p>Accepting for the sake the argument the &quot;small interval&quot; definition of<br/>microtonality, a fine issue arises: &quot;How small is &apos;small&apos;?&quot;</p><p>The standard interpretation of &quot;smaller than a semitone&quot; leaves<br/>considerable room for debate and ambiguity, because diatonic or<br/>chromatic semitones of historical European tuning systems can vary in<br/>size from around 1/3-tone (say 63 cents) to around 2/3-tone (say 126<br/>cents). Semitones of these specific sizes occur in the equal 19-note<br/>division of the octave advocated by the French composer Guillaume<br/>Costeley in 1570, or the almost identical meantone temperament with<br/>pure minor thirds described by the Spanish theorist Francisco Salinas<br/>in 1577.</p><p>Another interpretation might take as &quot;microtonal&quot; an interval too<br/>small to be perceived in a given musical context as a usual semitone.<br/>Under this definition, the enharmonic diesis or fifthtone of Nicola<br/>Vicentino at around 41 cents clearly qualifies, certainly in the<br/>setting of his music: it has a radically different effect than the<br/>diatonic semitone of his system at around 117 cents (or 3/5-tone), or<br/>the smaller chromatic semitone at around 76 cents (or 2/5-tone).</p><p>In contrast, a single step of 22-tET at 1/22 octave or about 55 cents<br/>makes a very convincing semitone in connection with a whole-tone of<br/>four steps, 4/22 octave or about 218 cents. This is an example of how<br/>in the right setting a literal &quot;quartertone&quot; can serve as a regular<br/>diatonic semitone, thus arguably falling outside the category of<br/>&quot;microtonal&quot; in the sense of &quot;too small to be heard as a usual scale<br/>step.&quot;</p><p>This 22-tET interval, by the way, illustrates how a &quot;quartertone&quot; can<br/>take on various sizes or shapes; while a step of 1/24-octave or 50<br/>cents may be the most familiar example because of the popularity of<br/>24-tET in the 20th century, it&apos;s only one possible form.</p><p>One curious conclusion is that an interval of around 50-55 cents might<br/>be &quot;microtonal&quot; in one musical setting, and a regular &quot;semitone&quot; in<br/>another.</p><p>If we regard the drawing of such a blurred line as an engaging but<br/>rather parochial study in the ethnomusicology of one regional<br/>compositional tradition among the many musics of the world, then the<br/>exercise can be at once edifying and harmless.</p><p>-------------------------------------------------------------<br/>$.2.2. Microtonalism as &quot;unusual&quot; intervals or tuning systems<br/>-------------------------------------------------------------</p><p>When introduced into a European style of composition where diatonic or<br/>chromatic semitones are the smallest recognized intervals, smaller<br/>intervals such as Vicentino&apos;s diesis at around 41 cents can have a<br/>strikingly &quot;unusual&quot; effect, in 1555 or 2001. A broadening of the<br/>&quot;microtonal&quot; concept focuses on this perception of the &quot;unusual,&quot;<br/>whether induced by intervals of small size, or simply of<br/>_unaccustomed_ size.</p><p>Consider, for example, a division of the octave into five equal parts,<br/>each an interval of 240 cents, which a listener accustomed to<br/>historical European tuning systems might hear as either a very large<br/>major second or whole-tone, or a very small minor third. This creative<br/>ambiguity, by the way, lends a special charm to tunings such as 20-tET<br/>when used for &quot;Western European-like&quot; styles.</p><p>This interval of 1/5-octave or 4/20-octave is much larger than a<br/>semitone, and therefore not &quot;microtonal&quot; in the narrow sense, but it<br/>arguably has a strikingly &quot;different&quot; quality for the uninitiated<br/>listener analogous to that of Vicentino&apos;s diesis.</p><p>One should hasten to add that for members of many world musical<br/>cultures, an interval of around 240 cents dividing the octave into<br/>five roughly equal parts is not &quot;unusual&quot; at all, but the routine<br/>norm, known simply as &quot;everyday musical practice.&quot;</p><p>Again, we find that &quot;unusualness&quot; is in the ear of the listener, and<br/>that paradoxically defining something like 240 cents as &quot;microtonal&quot;<br/>in order to celebrate its &quot;unusual&quot; qualities may be tacitly accepting<br/>a definition of &quot;usualness&quot; with definite ethnocentric implications.</p><p>----------------------------------<br/>$.2.2.1. How unusual is &quot;unusual&quot;?<br/>----------------------------------</p><p>Some intonational activists will argue that &quot;everything is microtonal<br/>except for 12-tET,&quot; including historical European tuning systems such<br/>as medieval Pythagorean intonation, Renaissance meantone, and<br/>17th-19th century unequal well-temperaments.</p><p>One curious paradox of this interpretation is that it leads to the<br/>conclusion that &quot;Renaissance and Manneristic music of the 16th century<br/>in Europe may generally be considered microtonal -- ranging from the<br/>most conventional settings to the most radical enharmonic styles of<br/>Vicentino and his colleagues -- except for anything which happened to<br/>be written for or performed on a 12-tET lute or similar instrument.&quot;</p><p>Applying our narrow definition of &quot;small intervals&quot; would lead to a<br/>distinction more like that which might be drawn and evidently was<br/>drawn, both by Vicentino and his critics such as Vincenzo Galilei,<br/>between &quot;usual&quot; music and &quot;enharmonic&quot; styles using the diesis or<br/>fifthtone.</p><p>If we do apply the broader &quot;microtonal-as-unusual&quot; concept in this<br/>16th-century setting, we may well reach the conclusion that while<br/>meantone on a harpsichord is everyday reality, 12-tET on such an<br/>instrument is &quot;xenharmonic&quot; or even &quot;microtonal.&quot;</p><p>Galilei, much enamored of this &quot;perfect&quot; temperament on the lute,<br/>tried it on a harpsichord -- and found the thirds unsatisfactory, a<br/>not unsurprising result given the nature of 16th-century style with<br/>its restful thirds, and of the harpsichord with its prominent fifth<br/>partial. As a &quot;strange&quot; keyboard tuning, this &quot;spherical&quot; temperament<br/>with its perfect symmetry and easy circumnavigability nevertheless had<br/>an attraction for Galilei and for an abbot named Girolamo Roselli who<br/>also celebrated these qualities.</p><p>In the 1630&apos;s, the great composer Girolamo Frescobaldi reportedly<br/>advocated that a new organ be tuned in 12-tET -- and was roundly<br/>ridiculed by one theorist of the time for allegedly being ignorant of<br/>the difference between a large and small semitone. Others remarked<br/>that 12-tET might be more palatable if it were less unfamiliar -- a<br/>comment sometimes offered concerning &quot;microtonal&quot; music in more recent<br/>times.</p><p>Although a definition of &quot;microtonal&quot; including all tunings except one<br/>may lead to such paradoxes, the &quot;anything but 12-tET&quot; approach does<br/>have a certain political logic. This would seem to be the logic of<br/>&quot;uniting against a common adversary.&quot;</p><p>A group of xenharmonicists who cannot agree among themselves as to<br/>whether a major third should ideally be tuned at 386 cents, 418 cents,<br/>or 435 cents can nevertheless say &quot;We&apos;re all non-400-cents!&quot;</p><p>The next step, however, might be to realize, &quot;Hey, 400 cents is<br/>interestingly different, somewhere &grave;between the cracks&apos; of the smaller<br/>or larger interval sizes (maybe both) we typically use -- and that<br/>makes it &grave;microtonal!&apos;&quot;</p><p>The adversary, then, is not 12-tET or any other tuning, but<br/>intonational monopoly, in other words, paucitonality. The problem is<br/>not how to distinguish between 12-tET and the &quot;microtonal&quot; universe,<br/>but rather how to put 12-tET squarely within that universe, somewhere<br/>on one arm of a certain spiral galaxy of equal tunings.</p><p>-----------------------------------------<br/>$.2.3. Microtonality as an open continuum<br/>-----------------------------------------</p><p>Defining &quot;microtonality&quot; not as a property of a specific interval or<br/>tuning, but as a dimension of variation encompassing all intervals and<br/>tuning systems, may avoid some of the pitfalls and paradoxes of the<br/>&quot;small interval&quot; and &quot;unusual interval/tuning&quot; concepts, while<br/>affirming the ideal of intonational pluralism often embodied by the<br/>&quot;small&quot; or &quot;unusual&quot; in a European-related setting.</p><p>More specifically, the &quot;microtonality as universal continuum&quot; concept<br/>may suggest a kinder and gentler strategy for convincing innocent<br/>bystanders or even decided opponents that 12-tET is only _one_ of the<br/>myriad of possibilities.</p><p>Rather than arguing why 12-tET is &quot;bad&quot; or &quot;dissonant&quot; or<br/>&quot;out-of-tune,&quot; all judgments based on stylistically specific<br/>assumptions which when generalized become just as questionable as the<br/>categorical assertion that &quot;12-tET is ideal,&quot; we can argue that<br/>&quot;12-tET is a fine tuning -- but only one.&quot;</p><p>From that starting point, as musician and mathematician Dan Stearns<br/>has said, there are fertile fields in all directions. An enthusiast of<br/>12-tET, or someone who has simply used it by default, might try a<br/>regular tuning making the fifths pure, or tempering them somewhat more<br/>heavily in the narrow direction, or tempering them a bit unevenly. A<br/>different strategy involving at once a small step and quantum leap is<br/>to tune _two_ 12-tET chains in 24-tET or 24-out-of-36-tET, discovering<br/>whole new families of intervals.</p><p>These approaches, and others, can help curious and inquiring minds and<br/>ears recognize the xenharmonic universe they already inhabit, with<br/>12-tET simply as one place (more attractive to some than to others) in<br/>a very rich musical cosmos.</p><p>-----<br/>Notes<br/>-----</p><p>1.

The logical pair microtonality-macrotonality has some precendence in<br/>the literature, and at least ought to be defined, controversies and all, in the<br/>FAQ.</p><p>I am famously against adding new terms when not absolutely necessary (the<br/>proliferation of unnecessary and inconsistant terminology is one reason for the<br/>marginal status of tuning in the music theory community). Your neologism<br/>&quot;paucitonality&quot; is interesting in the course of your polemic, but the passage<br/>based on McLaren did not really add up, for the following reasons:</p><p>(1) We know very little about Moellendorf&apos;s musical work, less about his<br/>politics, musical and otherwise, and even less about the politics of his<br/>critics. McLaren&apos;s attempt to extend the critique against Moellendorf&apos;s work as<br/>&quot;barbaric&quot; in 1917 Vienna to German history during 1933-45 does not resonate<br/>well. McLaren makes a terrible non-sequitor here, in that during the Third<br/>Reich, the Germans, as heirs to the historical barbarians, would not necessarily<br/>have used &quot;barbaric&quot; in this pejorative sense, but instead been rather<br/>circumspect with the term.</p><p>(2) As much as I would like this to have been the case, there is no evidence<br/>that microtonalists, as a class, were discriminated against politically as the<br/>atonalists had been.  To the contrary, there is some evidence that both right-<br/>and left-wing authoritarian states promoted microtonality: in Germany, where<br/>Trautwein was promoted to a professorship in 1936 (three years after<br/>Schoenberg&apos;s emigration) and in the early stages of the Russian revolution.<br/>Microtonalists could well be seen as promoting a form of tonality, indeed as<br/>having attempted to rescue tonality from the &quot;anarchy&quot; of atonal music, an<br/>anathema to regimes on both sides of the spectrum that were busy simultaneously<br/>banning the music of Alban Berg.  What I have read in contemporary criticism of<br/>Haba, for example, tended to focus on his athematic style, while his use of<br/>quartertones was viewed rather neutrally.</p><p>Margo, I praise you for daring to wade into the waters of musical politics and<br/>the politics around music making, but it is a field full of complications.  One<br/>example should suffice: the rise of 12-tone and serial music after the second<br/>world war was associated closely with the newly legitimized cultural prominence<br/>of the United States. This was quite directly supported by the activities of the<br/>CIA-sponsored Congress for Cultural Freedom (see, for example, Saunders: Who<br/>Paid The Piper? (London, Granta 1999)). The explicit Soviet censure of these<br/>techniques, combined with some naive ideas of our own (i.e. that 12-tone music<br/>was a democratization of tonal practice: 12 notes, 12 votes; that the<br/>quasi-scientific language associated with the techniques gave the music a<br/>special prestige, etc.) seemed to set up 12-tone music as the perfect modern and<br/>democratic foil to dreary socialist realism.  However, a generation later, the<br/>very same 12-toners, safely tenured and teaching throughout the US, often became<br/>as authoritarian as their former foes. The option of composing with 12-tone<br/>techniques had instead become a necessary sign of the intellectual rigor<br/>required for advancement through the academy.  Had the 12 tones changed in any<br/>way? No, but the political positions of the people who used them had changed,<br/>and that is where the problem is located.</p><p>I&apos;ve often imagined waking up one day to learn that the revolution had taken<br/>place and henceforth, as musicians, we were commanded to use only Just<br/>Intonation, which was defined as nothing other than Harry Partch&apos;s tonality<br/>diamond and the 43-tone chromelodeon scale. I would hope that in this moment I<br/>could summon up the courage to insist on my right to compose in 12tet. After<br/>all, as Erv Wilson has said, &quot;12tet has so much to recommend it, that I wish I<br/>had discovered it myself&quot;.</p><p>Daniel Wolf<br/>Composer,  Budapest/Morro Bay<br/><a href="mailto:djwolf1@matavnet.hu">djwolf1@matavnet.hu</a><br/><a href="http://home.snafu.de/djwolf/">http://home.snafu.de/djwolf/</a></p></div><h3><a id=19807 href="#19807">ðŸ”—</a>jpehrson@rcn.com</h3><span>3/5/2001 7:17:48 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In tuning@y..., &quot;M.

Only two thoughts came to<br/>mind, if it is OK to ask:</p><p>1. This definition essentially omits any mention of microtonality in<br/>the last 100 years.

It&apos;s the best and most<br/>objective definition of microtonality I&apos;ve seen.</p><p>In fact I&apos;d say it&apos;s a truly fantastic definition.<br/>And breathtakingly insightful.</p><p>I am most impressed because when I saw the posts in which<br/>it was revealed there would be an effort made to define<br/>microtonality I thought, &quot;Yeah, right.&quot; Then when Margo<br/>said she&apos;d give a go at a definition I thought, &quot;I love<br/>Margo&apos;s posts to death but the day she writes for a<br/>general audience is the day I become a duck.&quot;</p><p>All I can say now is, &quot;Quack!&quot;</p><p>And I don&apos;t have a problem with the paucitonality thing.<br/>She does define what she means. She sets it up to define<br/>her third definition of microtonality by defining its<br/>opposite which I think is the most straightforward way to<br/>go in this particular case.</p><p>And by coining this word, she&apos;s given us a nice<br/>condescending term to use when talking about the poor<br/>one-true-tuning advocates, whether they be<br/>dodecaphonicists or not! :)</p><p>Speaking of word-coining, I loved &apos;monomania&apos;, and plan to<br/>use that word as often as possible to describe fanaticial<br/>one-idea devotionalism that has bred the general air of<br/>intolerance which has beseiged our world.</p><p>I really love too her implication that microtonality is<br/>really at core an expression of philosophical objection to<br/>the closed-minded opposition to truth found in<br/>monomaniacism -- and the historical examples given of our<br/>fallen compatriots who fought to defend the cause.</p><p>I say, those who disagree strongly with her definition<br/>should write their own definitions and we can include them<br/>too. But let&apos;s not diminish Margo&apos;s great contribution by<br/>hijacking it and then altering it into submission.</p><p>Now to contradict what I just said in the last paragraph,<br/>I offer the following suggestion:</p><p>Change the condescending-sounding term with inaccurate<br/>implications:</p><p> &quot;self-proclaimed microtonalist Brian McLaren&quot;</p><p>to:</p><p> &quot;self-proclaimed microtonal historian Brian McLaren&quot;</p><p>or better yet the accurate:</p><p> &quot;microtonalist Brian McLaren&quot;</p><p>or why not even:</p><p> &quot;Brian McLaren&quot;</p><p>In conclusion, Margo has an astounding genius to unify<br/>psychotically diverging perspectives. She would do well<br/>either as a physicist or to join the UN and forge all<br/>nations into a novus ordo seclorum. Since I am virulently<br/>opposed to a novus ordo seclorum and will fight it with<br/>violent bloodshed if need be, I am glad that Margo instead<br/>has chosen to grace us with the focus of her energy<br/>towards noble human rights causes in the world and also<br/>towards microtonality, both for which I admire and commend<br/>her.</p><p>- Jeff</p></div><h3><a id=19827 href="#19827">ðŸ”—</a>Dave Keenan &#x3C;D.KEENAN@UQ.NET.AU&#x3E;</h3><span>3/5/2001 3:37:54 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Margo,</p><p>Thanks for writing that, but I really don&apos;t think that a FAQ list is<br/>the place to introduce _new_ terms and then have to explain _them_.<br/>:-)</p><p>The question &quot;What is microtonality?&quot; is beautifully answered<br/>(FAQ-style) in your first four paragraphs.
