My<br/>greatest find was a lydian augmented scale tucked away at bar 39 of  the Courante of his<br/>(Bach&apos;s) second Partita in D minor for solo violin. It can be analysed more conventionally,<br/>but the phrasing and the modal modulation of the following bars lends itself to this<br/>interpretation, and anyway, I wouldn&apos;t put anything past old Johann Sebastian.</p></div>
