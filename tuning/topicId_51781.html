<a href="/tuning">back to list</a><h1>announcement</h1><h3><a id=51781 href="#51781">ðŸ”—</a>Carl Lumma &#x3C;ekin@lumma.org&#x3E;</h3><span>1/14/2004 3:51:51 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Listers and Gentlemen,</p><p>Today you may notice that the membership count on our<br/>group has gone down.  This is because I have deleted some<br/>accounts.</p><p>Some were nothing but spammers that Gene and I were only<br/>previously able to disallow from posting.  Others were<br/>accounts that have been bouncing mail from the list.</p><p>Of the ~ 700 addresses we have on file, over 300 have<br/>been bouncing mail.  Most of these are &quot;soft bounces&quot;,<br/>which is supposed to mean that the recipient&apos;s mail<br/>server recognizes their address but for some reason can&apos;t<br/>deliver the message (their mailbox is full, say). However,<br/>many mail servers return a soft bounce when they mean<br/>&quot;hard bounce&quot;.  In practice the vast majority of soft<br/>bounces that have been going on for more than a few weeks<br/>are terminal.</p><p>A &quot;hard bounce&quot; is when the mail server says, &apos;invalid<br/>address&apos;.</p><p>I have only deleted accounts that were hard-bouncing mail<br/>for over a year, which had received 5 or more &quot;probes&quot;,<br/>to which no name was attached or recognizable.  Let me<br/>explain:</p><p>Probes are messages sent by yahoo when an account starts<br/>bouncing mail.  I haven&apos;t seen one, but a probe typically<br/>says something like, &apos;Hey, you&apos;re bouncing mail, do you<br/>want to stay on the tuning list?&apos;.</p><p>By not deleting any accounts with names attached to them<br/>I&apos;ve maintained the record we have of past members and<br/>their last known addresses.</p><p>I&apos;ve done all the deleting of bouncers I&apos;m going to do.</p><p>To keep the load on Yahoo&apos;s servers down, to keep our<br/>membership roster a useful resource, and to be responsible<br/>Internet users, the thing to do is LEAVE THE LIST PROPERLY.</p><p>If you intend to switch to using the web interface, or you<br/>just don&apos;t want to get the list for a while, you don&apos;t<br/>have to unsubscribe.  You can simply turn off e-mail.  To<br/>do this just send an empty e-mail message to...</p><p>&apos;tuning-nomail at <a href="http://yahoogroups.com">yahoogroups.com</a>&apos;</p><p>...or follow the &quot;Edit My Membership&quot; link in the top<br/>right corner at...</p><p><a href="http://groups.yahoo.com/group/tuning/">http://groups.yahoo.com/group/tuning/</a></p><p>If you do want to leave the group forever and never be<br/>contacted by anyone here again, please UNSUBSCRIBE by<br/>sending an empty e-mail to...</p><p>&apos;tuning-unsubscribe at <a href="http://yahoogroups.com">yahoogroups.com</a>&apos;</p><p>...or again use the web interface.  Don&apos;t just abandon<br/>your account.  It&apos;s littering.  Don&apos;t be a littering<br/>litterer.</p><p>That&apos;s all,</p><p>-Carl</p></div><h3><a id=51783 href="#51783">ðŸ”—</a>Carl Lumma &#x3C;ekin@lumma.org&#x3E;</h3><span>1/14/2004 4:55:15 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>If you *were* happily going along with the web interface<br/>but today it claims you&apos;re not a member, I have this to<br/>say:</p><p>&quot;Whoops, my bad.
