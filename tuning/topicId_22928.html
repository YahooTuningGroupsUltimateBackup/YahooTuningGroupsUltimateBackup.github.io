For example, one can run<br/>a least-squares optimization on the three errors: the deviation of<br/>the fifth itself from 3:2, the deviation of the major sixth generated<br/>by three such fifths (minus an octave) from 5:3, and the deviation of<br/>the major third generated by four such fifths (minus two octaves)<br/>from 5:4.
