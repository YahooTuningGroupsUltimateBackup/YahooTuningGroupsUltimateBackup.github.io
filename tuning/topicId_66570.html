Each subscale can be rotated the<br/>same number of times that it has different pitch classes, although<br/>the resulting rotations are not necessarily<br/>structurally distinct. Some will be redundant.</p><p>   But including the rotation operation brings the total<br/>up to 912 possible subscales, although the actual figure<br/>would be somewhere between 184 and 912, since there will<br/>be some rotations that are structurally redundant.</p><p>   This brings me to the topic of what I call &quot;nested<br/>inversions&quot; of 12EDO subscales. That involves aligning<br/>or sandwhiching a subscale and it&apos;s inversion next to each<br/>other in the minimum pitch/registral space. Here&apos;s the<br/>diagram for the nested inversion of the 1-2-3 scale step<br/>pattern 12EDO blues tetrachord:</p><p>Prime Form__________C___C#______D#__________F#<br/>Inversion Form______C___________D#______F___F#</p><p>   This &quot;nesting&quot; of a subscale and it&apos;s inversion is very<br/>important, because each different rotation of a particular subscale<br/>potentially results in a different superscale formed<br/>by the combination of the prime and the inversion forms.</p><p>   I have a Yahoo Group with MIDI file examples of this<br/>nesting process over here:</p><p><a href="http://launch.groups.yahoo.com/group/BluesNestedPentachordFiveToneScal">http://launch.groups.yahoo.com/group/BluesNestedPentachordFiveToneScal</a><br/>es/</p><p>   You have to join the group in order to access the MIDI files,<br/>which are in the group&apos;s files section.</p><p>   Bill.Flavell at <a href="http://GMail.com">GMail.com</a></p></div>
