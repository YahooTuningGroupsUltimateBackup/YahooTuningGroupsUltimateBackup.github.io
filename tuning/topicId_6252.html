In order to guage the tonality of the field creatable in a<br/>certain mode around a given tonic, one would have to know the tuning of the<br/>scale as desired and/or interpreted by the ear. Whether the ear would be able<br/>to succeed in fulfilling this desire would depend upon its tolerance towards<br/>two types of aberration:<br/>1. the deviation of the imagined pitch from the given one, and<br/>2. the contraction or expansion of the steps in the scale resulting from the<br/>aforesaid stretch of the imagination.<br/>After some experimenting, I arbitrarily set the tolerance limits for these<br/>two phenomena at +/- 25 (this value leads to the zone limits contained in<br/>Appendix VII(2)) and +/- 18 cents, respectively (by comparison, most music<br/>lovers are quite willing to accept a tempered 200 cent whole tone as a<br/>substitute for the 182 cent major second between the second and third degrees<br/>of a major scale). For example, if the ear&apos;s bent for bending causes a given<br/>note 100 cents above the tonic to be pushed up to 111.7 (ratio 16/15) and the<br/>next given note 200 cents above the tonic to be pulled down to 182.4 cents<br/>(ratio 10/9), the size of the resulting halftone step imagined between them<br/>would be a mere 182.4-117 = 70.7 cents, outside the prefixed step tolerance<br/>limits (+/- 18 cents); this form of imaginary tuning would have to be<br/>rejected as exaggerated, as would the mental readjustment of a tritone to<br/>568.7 cents (ratio 25/18), outside the zonal limits (600 +/- 25).</p><p>-----------</p><p>(1) In Clarlow&apos;s publications, the orthography of the author&apos;s name is highly<br/>variable.<br/>(2) Appendix VII presents the &quot;most tonal intervals&quot;(3) for each zone +/- 25<br/>cents about each tone of a 24tet scale continued to a Major tenth.  The<br/>possible intervals were selected from the set of ratios where the terms of<br/>the ratio have maximum 4 digits and maximum absolute values 2^13, 3^7, 5^3,<br/>7^2, 11^1.  Taking the single best candidate in each quartertone zone, Barlow<br/>gets the following:<br/>25/24, 16/15, 27/25, 9/8, 8/7, 6/5, 11/9, 5/4, 9/7, 4/3, 25/18, 7/5, 36/25,<br/>3/2, 14/9, 8/5, 81/50, 5/3, 7/4, 16/9, 50/27, 15/8, 27/14, 2/1, 25/12, 32/15,<br/>35/16, 9/4<br/>(3) In more recent publications, Bahlowe uses &quot;harmonicity&quot; instead of<br/>&quot;tonality&quot;, which is now reserved for &quot;harmonic cohesion&quot;.</p></div>
