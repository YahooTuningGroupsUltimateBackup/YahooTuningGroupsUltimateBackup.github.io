Are ratios usually<br/>&gt; catagorized by prime limit or odd limit?</p><p>Funny that Dante should bring this up<br/>right now.  I had already written the following<br/>before reading his post:<br/>--------------------------------------</p><p>For the purposes of accuracy<br/>and updating in my book, I would<br/>like to know which of you agree<br/>to the following (mutually-exclusive)<br/>choices regarding the important<br/>aspects of tuning/ musical perception,<br/>etc. If you feel that different<br/>aspects are important for different<br/>considerations, please express that<br/>fact.</p><p>1) Integer factors of ratios<br/>2) Odd factors of ratios<br/>3) Prime factors of ratios</p><p>Please feel free to add to this list<br/>and to explain in more detail.</p><p>Also, if you know about historical<br/>feelings about these aspects by<br/>other theorists, please illuminate.</p><p>I&apos;ll get the ball rolling by saying<br/>that I place supreme importance on<br/>the prime factors for all the important<br/>harmonic/ timbral considerations.</p><p>Paul Erlich places importance on<br/>the odd factors for consideration of<br/>the consonance of chords, scales, etc.<br/>(Paul has already given a pretty<br/>good elaboration in answer to Dante).</p><p>Partch placed importance on the odd<br/>factors for chord consonance and for<br/>delineation of a tonality.  However,<br/>he seems to place importance on prime<br/>factors for other (admittedly more<br/>ephemeral) considerations (Partch<br/>scholars please elaborate).</p><p>My book has a lot of historical<br/>tuning information, and I&apos;d like<br/>to include as much of contemporary<br/>thought on the subject as possible,<br/>so I&apos;d appreciate lots of response<br/>to this.  I particularly need more<br/>info in more exotic tunings, like<br/>those based on pi, non-octave, etc.</p><p>- Monzo</p><p>___________________________________________________________________<br/>You don&apos;t need to buy Internet access to use free Internet e-mail.<br/>Get completely free e-mail from Juno at <a href="http://www.juno.com/getjuno.html">http://www.juno.com/getjuno.html</a><br/>or call Juno at (800) 654-JUNO [654-5866]</p></div>
