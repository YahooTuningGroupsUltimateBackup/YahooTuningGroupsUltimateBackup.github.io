If so, could give a bit of a description on what you are doing with them, how does it related to a &quot;normally&quot; tuned instrument?</p><p>Also, how do the performers react to playing a &quot;mistuned&quot; instrument? Do they seem to have a bad reaction to &quot;fingering&quot; a pitch while hearing a different (unexpected) pitch?</p><p>What sorts of controls are built into the patches you have designed for the instrument? I am curious about how you would handle such things as &quot;embouchure&quot; (which on a real instrument would effect the pitch of the note)? I would imagine that the natural tendency of the performer would be to apply more &quot;embouchure&quot; to get the pitch that they expect (or am I wrong here...).</p><p>Thank,</p><p>Mike</p></div>
