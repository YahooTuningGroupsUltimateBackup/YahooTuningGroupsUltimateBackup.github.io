Jon, are you listening?</p><p>Yes, always. I had already thought of Bosanquet, but had never actually<br/>seen one of the kbds in use. I also thought of some of Kraig Grady&apos;s<br/>metallophones, whose keys are laid out (I think) like either some of<br/>Wilson&apos;s ideas or similar to Bosanquet.</p><p>But, yes, those are the ideas. What a wonderful world, if the performing<br/>instrument also served as a demonstrable template for the underlying<br/>tuning/harmonic/melodic fabric...</p><p>***</p><p>Well, I said &quot;Yes, always&quot;, but some of the postings are becoming so obtuse<br/>and childish that I may take leave again. Paul, you put a lot of good info<br/>down the pike and then you throw in something like &quot;suppressed by the JI<br/>extremists?&quot; Please. This sounds like some of the lunatic rantings of...<br/>someone who used to post here long ago, evoking visions of black<br/>helicopters descending in the night.</p><p>You only denigrate your own scholastic integrity with junk like that.</p><p>And for godsake, Johnny: the meaning of the word microtone, like so many<br/>billions of words, can be pretty well ascertained by looking at it&apos;s parts.<br/>It would seem that every common use of the prefix &quot;micro-&quot; refers to small,<br/>from the Greek mikros. After so much time spent researching and performing,<br/>you too are weakening your work by barking up this ridiculous tree.</p><p>I can see it now: in a couple of months, we will have disagreements on the<br/>words &quot;alternate&quot;, &quot;tuning&quot;, and &quot;list&quot; -- all taking place on the<br/>alternate tuning list. At that time all of the events that were *supposed*<br/>to happen by virtue of the Y2K bug will occur simultaneously. Bit will<br/>collide, teeth will gnash, blood will run in the streets, pestilence, jock<br/>itch...</p><p>All so very tedious.</p><p>Cheers,<br/>Jon<br/>&grave;&apos;&grave;&apos;&grave;&apos;&grave;&apos;&grave;&apos;&grave;&apos;&grave;&apos;&grave;&apos;&grave;&apos;&grave;&apos;&grave;&apos;&grave;&apos;&grave;&apos;&grave;&apos;&grave;&apos;&grave;&apos;&grave;&apos;&grave;&apos;&grave;&apos;&grave;&apos;&grave;&apos;&grave;&apos;&grave;&apos;&grave;&apos;&grave;&apos;&grave;&apos;&grave;&apos;&grave;&apos;&grave;&apos;&grave;&apos;&grave;&apos;&grave;&apos;&grave;&apos;&grave;<br/>    Jonathan M.
