I had hoped to receive<br/>it in time for my Microfest lecture in April, but am glad<br/>to finally have it in any case.</p><p>The book is very short (only 15 pages of text), and the only<br/>musical illustrations are a page of examples and a 1-page<br/>score at the very end.</p><p>Upon opening the book and seeing the scores, I was *stunned* to<br/>see the accidental that Mager uses to notate 1/4-tones:  ^   !!!</p><p>That&apos;s not simply an ASCII adaptation... that&apos;s *exactly*<br/>what Mager&apos;s symbol looks like.</p><p>The first illustration, which compares the notations of<br/>M&ouml;llendorf, Stein, and Mager, shows the 1/4-tone accidentals<br/>as up and down arrows, and as single upward- and downward-<br/>pointing angled &quot;hooks&quot; at the top or bottom of the<br/>sharp and flat signs.</p><p>Except for that first musical example, the musical<br/>illustrations don&apos;t use the arrow pointing downward, so<br/>Mager apparently decided not to make use of 1/4-tone<br/>enharmonic equivalents, so that his version of 24-EDO<br/>notation would only need one new accidental sign.</p><p>Pretty cool, I think... and that also puts the historical<br/>precedent for using ^ (and, by extension, other types<br/>of upward-pointing arrows) for 1/4-tones all the way back<br/>to 1918, when this book was published.</p><p>My Interlibrary Loan request also did a thorough search<br/>of libraries all over the world for the 2nd edition of<br/>Richard H. Stein&apos;s _Zwei Konzertst&uuml;cke_, but with no results.<br/>A record for it turns up in one OCLC listing, but the<br/>actual copy was not found.  Does anyone have any idea where<br/>a copy of this might be hiding?</p><p>Mager&apos;s illustration of Stein&apos;s notation shows that Stein<br/>used:</p><p>1/4-tone sharp:  a sharp sign with only one vertical line<br/>3/4-tone sharp:  a sharp sign with 3 vertical lines<br/>1/4-tone flat:   a backwards flat sign (something like a d)<br/>3/4-tone flat:   a double backwards flat sign (dd)</p><p>Of the three (M&ouml;llendorf, Stein, Mager), Mager&apos;s arrows<br/>are by far the easiest to read and the quickest to comprehend.<br/>Or maybe that&apos;s just my bias...</p><p>Interestingly enough, the dedication page says:</p><p>&gt; Dem Andenken<br/>&gt;                Leo N. Tolstojs</p><p>I imagine that that&apos;s the same Leo Tolstoy we all know<br/>as the great Russian writer.</p><p>I&apos;ll make this into a webpage once it&apos;s been translated.</p><p>-monz<br/><a href="http://www.monz.org">http://www.monz.org</a><br/>&quot;All roads lead to n^0&quot;</p></div><h3><a id=26062 href="#26062">ðŸ”—</a>jpehrson@rcn.com</h3><span>7/6/2001 9:36:21 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In tuning@y..., &quot;monz&quot; &lt;joemonz@y...&gt; wrote:</p><p><a href="/tuning/topicId_26036.html#26036">/tuning/topicId_26036.html#26036</a></p><p>&gt;<br/>&gt; Hello all,<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; A copy of J&ouml;rg Mager&apos;s _Vierteltonmusik_ has finally arrived<br/>&gt; at my local library, all the way from the library of the<br/>&gt; University of G&ouml;ttingen in Germany.
