None of these &gt; possibilities are excluded by a just orientation. In fact, in my &gt; experience, the just orientation facilitates these possibilities.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I realize that there is a fear out there that using the intervals of &gt; just intonation and the harmonic series as a point of orientation is a &gt; kind of poison pill, and the same prejudice is held against learning to &gt; tune intervals using 12tet as a point of departure, that somehow, by &gt; application of these, that they will reify themselves, infecting ones &gt; music-making with the evils of ET or JI ideologies.  I do not insist &gt; that anyone else share my approach, but I can recommend it, as a way of &gt; operating from a position of strength, even /detournement/ (as the &gt; Situationists would have had it), to be able to treat just intervals or &gt; the 12tet scale as a neutral instance, through which the greatest &gt; possible spectrum of possibilities can be efficiently realized, and &gt; even, perhaps, get beyond the basic issues of realization in order to &gt; deal with the more complex issues of turning a bunch of sounds into &gt; something musical.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Daniel Wolf<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;  &gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; You can configure your subscription by sending an empty email to one<br/>&gt; of these addresses (from the address at which you receive the list):<br/>&gt;   <a href="mailto:tuning-subscribe@yahoogroups.com">tuning-subscribe@yahoogroups.com</a> - join the tuning group.<br/>&gt;   <a href="mailto:tuning-unsubscribe@yahoogroups.com">tuning-unsubscribe@yahoogroups.com</a> - leave the group.<br/>&gt;   <a href="mailto:tuning-nomail@yahoogroups.com">tuning-nomail@yahoogroups.com</a> - turn off mail from the group.<br/>&gt;   <a href="mailto:tuning-digest@yahoogroups.com">tuning-digest@yahoogroups.com</a> - set group to send daily digests.<br/>&gt;   <a href="mailto:tuning-normal@yahoogroups.com">tuning-normal@yahoogroups.com</a> - set group to send individual emails.<br/>&gt;   <a href="mailto:tuning-help@yahoogroups.com">tuning-help@yahoogroups.com</a> - receive general help information.<br/>&gt;  &gt; Yahoo!
