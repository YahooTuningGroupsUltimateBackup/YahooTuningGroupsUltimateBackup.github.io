Back when I was<br/>looking at Enrique Ubieta&apos;s bimodal &quot;triad,&quot; the &quot;triads&quot; I ended up<br/>liking best -- in a closed position, and on a purely by ear basis --<br/>were the ones where the two thirds were spaced something like a 54/49<br/>apart, and the &quot;triad&quot; was something like a 1/1 7/6 9/7 3/2 (i.e., a<br/>6:7:9 and a 1/(9:7:6) combined). And I briefly played around with an<br/>0, 2, 3, 5, 6, 8, 9, 11, 13, 14, 9-tone scale in 14-tET (14-tET does<br/>not distinguish between the 12/7 and the 7/4, and in fact it sort of<br/>splits the difference):</p><p>14/9.--------,7/6.--------,7/4.<br/>     &grave;.     ,     &grave;.     ,     &grave;.<br/>       &grave;4/3,--------&grave;1/1,--------,3/2.--------,9/8.<br/>                        &grave;.      ,     &grave;.     ,     &grave;.<br/>                          &grave;12/7,--------&grave;9/7,--------27/14</p><p>However, I&apos;m almost certain that some empirically derived &apos;optimal&apos;<br/>closed position bimodal triadic voicing was not the sort of thing that<br/>Ubieta had in mind, as he wrote, &quot;the essence of the harmonic<br/>discipline of Bimodalism lies in the simultaneous blending of major<br/>and minor modes in triads with the same fundamental root,&quot; and this<br/>sounds to me as though he is perhaps seeing his bimodal &quot;triad&quot; as<br/>something akin to a 16:19:20:24 identity:</p><p>        5/4<br/>        / \<br/>     19/16 \<br/>      /     \<br/>     /       \<br/>    /         \<br/>   /           \<br/>  /             \<br/>1/1-------------3/2</p><p>where both thirds would be a harmonic series overtone, therefore<br/>accomplishing the &quot;simultaneous blending of major and minor modes in<br/>triads with the same fundamental root.&quot; Though he also wrote,<br/>&quot;consequently, both remote tonalities and modulation concepts are<br/>senseless in Bimodalism, as it is intrinsically a chain of 12<br/>equivalent and harmonically linked chords, forming, in fact, a true<br/>unitonality,&quot; and here I&apos;m inclined to see this as something more<br/>along the lines of a 4:5:6 overtonal, and a 1/(6:5:4) undertonal<br/>symmetry (i.e., &quot;unitonality&quot;):</p><p>    5/4<br/>    / \<br/>   /   \<br/>  /     \<br/>1/1-----3/2<br/>  \     /<br/>   \   /<br/>    \ /<br/>    6/5</p><p>Though I found this closed position &quot;bimodal&quot; triad to sound much<br/>better in 12-tET than it does in 5-limit JI.</p><p>Dan Stearns</p></div><h3><a id=9450 href="#9450">ðŸ”—</a>Afmmjr@aol.com</h3><span>4/3/2000 3:24:46 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Daniel has well pointed out the ancient Greek sense of diatonic.  Nicola<br/>Vicentino wrote of the difference between the Renaissance and the post-Roman<br/>(Boethius) versions.  Vicentino wrote in 1555:</p><p>&quot;The difference between our practice and the one discussed by Boethius is<br/>this: Ancient musicians used the genera individually in their practice and<br/>consequently the minor semitone with two sesquioctaval whole tones were<br/>satisfactory for the genera.  But in our times, both the sound of practical<br/>music and the tuning of instruments are unlike those of ancient musicians,<br/>for we use the genera and the species together and with more consonances than<br/>they had--namely, thirds and sixths.  To be able to have more consonances as<br/>well as to make many steps, we do not find it inconvenient to blunt a fifth<br/>and enlarge a fourth, as I said.  This blunting, as you will learn in the<br/>proper place (book V, chapter 5), does not shock the sense of hearing because<br/>the quantity removed is so tiny in itself and because these particles are<br/>distributed here and there wherever they are needed.  Practitioners of this<br/>tuning describe such fifths and fourths as tempered.&quot;  (Vicentino, p. 45 of<br/>Maria Rika Maniates translation)</p><p>As sensible as the above seems to me, the translator wrote in a coupled<br/>footnote:</p><p>Footnote #48: &quot;The gist of this paragraph suggests that Vicentino here, as<br/>elsewhere, put together an inaccurate and rather haphazard conflation of<br/>propositions and opinions culled from the &quot;Musica theorica&quot; by Fogliano, an<br/>organist and choirmaster who served the Este family in Modena.  Fogliano&apos;s<br/>text, then, may explain the anomalies in Vicentino&apos;s arguments.&quot;</p><p>Does this dark shadow on her subject make sense to anyone?</p><p>Johnny Reinhard?</p></div>
