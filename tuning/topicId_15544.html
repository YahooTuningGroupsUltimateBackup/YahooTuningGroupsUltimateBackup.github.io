Besides McLaughlin, we had Zakir Hussain on tabla, U.<br/>Shrinivas on electric mandolin, and V. Selvaganesh on percussion (sorry,<br/>I don&apos;t know the proper names, but there was a clay pot, a long hand<br/>drum, and a small tambourine). I&apos;m not going to give a play by play<br/>description...suffice it to say, the Maestros were in town, and I doubt<br/>if there are folks anywhere in the world who are on a higher level of<br/>musicality...it was transcendent. The response by the crowd at the end<br/>was amazing...people wouldn&apos;t quite clapping/yelling...deservedly so.<br/>    And, I learned a few things...hate to say it, but the concert<br/>actually made me a bit pissy today, after I turned on the radio and<br/>tried to find some real music to listen to...sorry, the 10 billionth<br/>version of Monk or Charlie Parker, the 20 billionth version of Haydn,<br/>the sorry assed pop/rap, the incredibly lame &quot;country&quot; music...we&apos;re in<br/>a sorry assed state, artistically, to be sure. And, again, I hate to say<br/>it, but the only thing I didn&apos;t  like about the concert was the sound of<br/>the 12 eq scale in the context of their music..I found myself wishing it<br/>would go away, and we could hear the Masters exploring the spaces in<br/>between the 12 tone system. I had a realization, that the 12 tone system<br/>is really coarse sounding, not very subtle compared to many other<br/>available systems...not a big surprise, but true. I have always been<br/>somewhat puzzled why McLaughlin, with his intense interest in Indian<br/>music, never broke away from 12 eq...I think it&apos;s a shame. Still, a<br/>marvelous experience..Hstick</p></div><h3><a id=15554 href="#15554">ðŸ”—</a>Paul H.

I love the _Remember Shakti_ album recorded in<br/>&apos;97 and released this year - Hariprasad Charasia&apos;s flute is probably my<br/>favorite instrument in the world. This album has had a profound influence on<br/>my musical activities, as the &apos;73 Santana-McLaughlin _Love Devotion<br/>Surrender_ album did four or five years ago. I love Miles Davis, Santana,<br/>Hendrix, Duane Allman and his 20-year old reincarnation Derek Trucks. In<br/>Santana&apos;s blues, McLaughlin&apos;s chaotic bends, Allman&apos;s and Truck&apos;s slide<br/>genius, and needless to say in Hendrix, the attempt to escape from 12-tET is<br/>speaking loud and clear. Why not make the break? I think the answer is<br/>culture.</p><p>To these masters, music was everything, and music meant playing with other<br/>musicians. _Any_ other musicians, from anywhere in the Western world (&amp;<br/>beyond!), who are among the few geniuses who can transcend existing styles<br/>and bridge cultural differences. You want to be able to set up an instant<br/>communication with them, be able to play variations of their ideas and have<br/>them play variations on yours. You don&apos;t want them to have to worry about<br/>their intonation and you don&apos;t want to have to worry about yours.</p><p>From what I caught of their exploration at the Microthon, Bearsley and<br/>Pagano have achieved this much with a particular form of Just Intonation.<br/>The difference is that the 12-eq musicians in question were deeply immersed<br/>in, and masters of, several culturally significant styles of music. They<br/>brought different styles of music together partially by _speaking_ to other<br/>musicians around, all 12-eq-based, in their own languages, and so<br/>compellingly that they became musical leaders . . . I think speaking as<br/>truthfully as possible to as many people, within a group situation rather<br/>than alone, was the goal of these musicians, and had they not been musicians<br/>I think they might have been ministers or politicians or revolutionaries in<br/>a public sphere . . .</p></div><h3><a id=15566 href="#15566">ðŸ”—</a>phv40@hotmail.com</h3><span>11/16/2000 9:26:28 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@egroups.com">tuning@egroups.com</a>, &quot;Paul H.

This is a man who had<br/>the means to invest in six Minimoogs and a specially built guitar to<br/>play them simultaneously and later invest in a Synclavier guitar<br/>system.</p><p>My take was that more musicians, particularly guitarists, would get<br/>into alternative tuning systems if they could pick up such<br/>instruments at a low cost, straight off the rack.  Basically the same<br/>point D.Stearns made in his post on this thread.  Strides have been<br/>made, in that you can now get a new fretless acoustic for $450 and an<br/>electric with built-in Sustainer for $200 more.  Next thing that<br/>needs to be done is get these things into the superstores so that the<br/>Net is not the only option for shopping for these things.  And put<br/>out non-Sustainer models (reduce the cost) that are fretted, probably<br/>in some ET that is easy to deal with (you&apos;ve put in the time<br/>researching ETs so you may have a better idea of a specific &quot;starter&quot;<br/>ET).
