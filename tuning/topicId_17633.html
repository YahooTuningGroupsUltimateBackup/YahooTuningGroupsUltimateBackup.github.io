Let&apos;s say you are interested<br/>in the consistency limits of 25-tone equal temperament. You scroll down the<br/>table, keeping your eye on the third column (&quot;Number of tones per octave&quot;)<br/>until you get to the range you want -- these two lines:</p><p>  5    48.09233    24.95201     6      9   8<br/>  6    47.80317    25.10294     4      9   6</p><p>See the &quot;6&quot; in the fourth column of the first line, and the &quot;6&quot; in the first<br/>column of the second line? These two numbers will always be the same no<br/>matter where you are in the table. They tell you the integer consistency<br/>limit of the ET in question. Since it&apos;s 6 in this case, you know that if, in<br/>25-tET, you wish to approximate any JI chord all of whose intervals are<br/>ratios of numbers 6 or below, each interval can be represented by that<br/>interval&apos;s closest equivalent in 25-tET without inconsistency. Since 25-tET<br/>has perfect octaves, you know that it therefore has an odd consistency limit<br/>of 5 -- but this table works for non-octave equal temperaments too, such as<br/>the BP scale (which is 8.202-tET).</p><p>With me so far?</p></div><h3>Joseph Pehrson &#x3C;joseph@composersconcordance.org&#x3E;</h3><span>1/18/2001 7:14:07 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@egroups.com">tuning@egroups.com</a>, &quot;Paul H.

The point of consistency is that<br/>many theorists evaluted ETs in terms of how well their intervals approximate<br/>JI intervals. Let&apos;s leave aside for the moment the debate over whether this<br/>is a useful evaluation -- let&apos;s assume that it is. Now, typically these<br/>theorists would look as 24-tET and say, &quot;Well, 4:5 is 14 cents off, 5:7 is<br/>17 cents off, and 4:7 is 19 cents off, so 24-tET can approximate JI ratios<br/>involving 4, 5, and 7 to an accuracy of better than 20 cents&quot;. The flaw in<br/>this reasoning is that the typical music for which JI is proposed often uses<br/>more than two voices simultaneously, so chords like 4:5:7 will occur. But in<br/>24-tET, you can&apos;t play a 4:5:7 within an accuracy of 20 cents, since the<br/>14-cent-off 4:5 plus the 17-cent-off 5:7 doesn&apos;t add up to the 19-cent-off<br/>4:7, but rather to an interval 31 cents off 4:7.</p><p>The point of consistency is to ensure that this situation _won&apos;t_ occur for<br/>a particular ET and a particular (integer or odd) harmonic limit.</p></div><h3>Todd Wilcox &#x3C;twilcox@patriot.net&#x3E;</h3><span>1/19/2001 3:57:01 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Paul Erlich again:<br/>&gt; &gt;Faulting 24-tET<br/>&gt; &gt;for not being able to produce a just 4:5:7 makes about as<br/>&gt; much sense as<br/>&gt; &gt;faulting a 7-limit scale for not being able to produce an<br/>&gt; interval of 1000<br/>&gt; &gt;cents.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; That&apos;s not quite right.

Both twins<br/>are heavily exposed to recorded music, but are not allowed to play or tune<br/>any instruments as they grow up. Twin A only listens to music recorded on<br/>12-tET instuments. Twin B is only exposed to a JI tuning, which may be<br/>adaptive for the purposes of this argument, if you prefer.<br/>On their 23rd birthdays, each twin is exposed to the other&apos;s tuning system.<br/>If I understand you correctly, you would wager that the twin raised in the<br/>ET system might hear the JI recordings and think &quot;ahh.. that&apos;s much easier<br/>to listen to,&quot; albeit maybe subconciously, while the twin raised JI will<br/>find the ET recordings at least mildly distasteful.<br/>*I* would say that both twins would find each other&apos;s system equally<br/>distasteful.</p><p>I base that on the fact that whereas I know that certain frequency ratios do<br/>have important and consistent psychoacoustical effects (the most important<br/>and famous being the octave), preferring just intervals is not inborn. You<br/>assume that a 4:5:6 is &quot;correct&quot; and that the ear would hear an equivalent<br/>ET chord as an &quot;out of tune 4:5:6.&quot; I don&apos;t agree. I&apos;d say a major chord has<br/>a certian sound in an ET system, and a certain sound in a JI system, and<br/>that if you&apos;re raised on ET major chord, you probably won&apos;t like the JI<br/>major chord, and vice-versa and so on for other harmonic constructions (like<br/>minor chords). To go back to the example, the JI child might head an ET<br/>chord as an &quot;out of tune 4:5:6&quot; whereas the ET child would hear an &quot;out of<br/>tune 0,400,700&quot; (cents of course).</p><p>Later post from Paul:<br/>&gt; more than two voices simultaneously, so chords like 4:5:7 will occur. But<br/>in<br/>&gt; 24-tET, you can&apos;t play a 4:5:7 within an accuracy of 20 cents, since the<br/>&gt; 14-cent-off 4:5 plus the 17-cent-off 5:7 doesn&apos;t add up to the 19-cent-off<br/>&gt; 4:7, but rather to an interval 31 cents off 4:7.</p><p>Once again, this thinking presupposes the correctness of the just ratios.<br/>Note the use of the word &quot;accuracy.&quot; I may be flying in the face of<br/>psychoacoustical convention, but I just don&apos;t agree that the human brain<br/>prefers just intervals at the biological level.</p><p>Todd</p></div><h3>Paul H.

If the music was written _specifically_ for<br/>12-tET, then it should be played in 12-tET. However, a lot of Western music<br/>_wasn&apos;t_ originally written for 12-tET! (slightly off-topic . . .)</p><p>&gt;Once again, this thinking presupposes the correctness of the just ratios.<br/>&gt;Note the use of the word &quot;accuracy.&quot; I may be flying in the face of<br/>&gt;psychoacoustical convention, but I just don&apos;t agree that the human brain<br/>&gt;prefers just intervals at the biological level.</p><p>It&apos;s not a matter of convention but of many different experiments. Let me<br/>give you some examples. In the psychoacoustical literature you will come<br/>across the well-known phenomemon of &quot;roughness&quot;. This is what happens when<br/>two pitches are close enough together so that they excite overlapping<br/>portions of the cochlea (the organ in the inner ear which sorts incoming<br/>sounds along a pitch continuum). Roughness is easy to demonstrate in<br/>musically trained or untrained subjects. Roughness is often accompanied by<br/>beating, which is a simple wavering phenomenon that happens when two pitches<br/>are very close together (see the Feynman Lectures on Physics) -- the<br/>resulting sound is a pitch halfway between the two actual pitches, whose<br/>amplitude varies from zero to maximum at a frequency equal to the difference<br/>between the frequencies of the two actual pitches.</p><p>Now let&apos;s compare what happens when you hear a just major third vs. an ET<br/>major third. In the ET major third, the 5th partial of the lower note will<br/>be 14 cents away from the 4th partial of the higher note. This is very<br/>close, and will hence be accompanied by some roughness and beating. On the<br/>other hand, in the JI major third, the two frequencies will coincide<br/>_exactly_, and though there may be some constructive or destructive<br/>interference, there will be absolutely no roughness or beating. Hence the<br/>interval sounds &quot;smoother&quot;, more &quot;clearly defined&quot; -- whether or not this is<br/>aesthetically preferable depends of course on the background of the listener<br/>and how (if at all) the sensation related to any musical experience the<br/>listener may have. In fact, it&apos;s been shown that of musically untrained<br/>listeners, there are two groups: some listeners consistently prefer major<br/>thirds that are about 15 cents out-of-tune, while other listeners<br/>consistenly prefer just ones.</p><p>The relation of musical tuning theory to beating is most fully developed in<br/>the book _On the Sensations of Tone_ by Helmholtz, which you should read.<br/>However, other psychoacoustical phenomena also lead one to treat just<br/>intervals and chords as &quot;special&quot;, though the precise conclusions will<br/>differ according to which phenomena are involved . . .

You<br/>can&apos;t tune non-JI intervals by ear with anything like the same degree of<br/>accuracy.</p><p>Another thing that makes them special is that the harmonic series is, to a<br/>large extent, the template for harmony. This goes to one of the other<br/>psychoacoustical phenomena which you should read about: virtual pitch. We<br/>have evolved (or, some argue, prenatally learned) to recognize harmonic<br/>series in our environments, and a few harmonics can be sufficient to evoke<br/>the pitch of a physically absent fundamental (no, this is not difference<br/>tones). Much of tonal harmony makes use of this mechanism, primarily by<br/>evoking the 2nd, 3rd, 4th, 6th, 8th, and sometimes 5th and even 7th, 9th,<br/>and 10th harmonics over a &quot;root&quot;, an implied fundamental. Although 12-tET is<br/>close enough for this effect still to work, it is important to understand<br/>that the harmonic series is actually the origin of this phenomemon,<br/>particularly if you are trying to create new styles of music where the<br/>phenomemon can be evoked under more specious circumstances, imply higher<br/>harmonics, or differ in other ways from harmony as we know it. Although the<br/>&quot;smoothness&quot; may be unpleasant at first, it&apos;s clear that the closer your<br/>tuning is to a harmonic series, the more easily you&apos;ll be able to imply a<br/>rooted harmony, often of a kind totally unheard in 12-tET, and that is the<br/>attraction of JI, or tuning systems close to JI, to many of us on this list.</p></div><h3>Joseph Pehrson &#x3C;joseph@composersconcordance.org&#x3E;</h3><span>1/19/2001 6:44:43 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@egroups.com">tuning@egroups.com</a>, &quot;Paul H.
