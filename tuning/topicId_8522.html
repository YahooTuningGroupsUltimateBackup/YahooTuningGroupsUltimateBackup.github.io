He has several double<br/>&gt; neck guitars, one neck fretless, one 12 eq; he&apos;s playing bluesy stuff,<br/>&gt; but studied for 10 years with Ali Akbar Khan. No mention of tuning.</p><p>I&apos;ll see if I can get a promo copy of his cd to play on the show.</p><p>&gt; The<br/>&gt; March issue, I am told, has an article about our compadre Stephen James<br/>&gt; Taylor. I have not yet read it, but heard it was favorable.</p><p>Ned Evett who made his fretless with a glass(!) fingerboard stopped<br/>by the booth on Sunday. I&apos;ve known him by email for a while. He told<br/>me he has also made these guitars for Joe Satriani an John McLaughlin.<br/>We&apos;re doing a cd trade so hopefully I&apos;ll be playing his music on the<br/>show in the weeks to come. (Special Hindustani Guitar show on right now<br/>as I type!)</p><p>&gt; These are<br/>&gt; good things. Love to hear more about the adventures of  the<br/>&gt; microtonal/fretless guitars at NAMM...a friend of mine, Kenny Kidd,<br/>&gt; played a 9 string guitar set out there, and got to meet SJT...small<br/>&gt; world...Hstick</p><p>Smaller than you think: he was at the booth across the intersection<br/>from us. He also came by and introduced himself, mentioned that he knew<br/>Neil Haverstick.</p><p>--<br/>* D a v i d         B e a r d s l e y<br/>*           <a href="mailto:xouoxno@virtulink.com">xouoxno@virtulink.com</a><br/>*<br/>* 49/32  R a d i o &quot;all microtonal, all the time&quot;<br/>* M E L A  v i r t u a l  d r e a m house monitor<br/>*<br/>* <a href="http://www.virtulink.com/immp/lookhere.htm">http://www.virtulink.com/immp/lookhere.htm</a></p></div><h3>Darren Burgess &#x3C;dburgess@acceleration.net&#x3E;</h3><span>2/13/2000 1:53:05 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>David B,</p><p>Just picked up a gem at the used CD shop.
