But this is specifically a 5-limit<br/>temperament (class) we&apos;re talking about. Optimally tuned, it looks<br/>like parallel 12-equal chains about 15 cents apart. As a way of<br/>approximating pure 5-limit harmonies, something very much this was<br/>proposed by Harald Waage (who also used it for 7-limit), but<br/>something even more like it was proposed by John Haywood Compton in<br/>1933. So it seems much more prudent to name this temperament after<br/>Compton than after Aristoxenus.</p></div>
