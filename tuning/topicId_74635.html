After tempering the commas out, I found out that a single octave is made of 6 neutral seconds and two minor seconds in this system.

Most of the well known regular temperaments can be defined by combining ET&apos;s -- such as meantone, which could be viewed as intermediate between 12-ET and 19-ET.

With the scheme of using ET&apos;s to identify regular temperaments, which I find useful, it would be 22&amp;74 (intermediate between 22-ET and 74-ET), or 74&amp;96 (between 74-ET and 96-ET). If you look at a chart of equal temperaments like the one at <a href="http://tonalsoft.com/enc/e/equal-temperament.aspx">http://tonalsoft.com/enc/e/equal-temperament.aspx</a> , you can draw a line between two ET&apos;s, and that shows you the range of possible tunings.</p><p>The generator mapping of kwasy is:</p><p>[&lt;2, 1, 6], &lt;0, 8, -5]&gt;</p><p>with example tunings for the generators:<br/>P = 600.002686, G = 162.742975 (TOP tuning of the generators)<br/>P = 600.003398, G = 162.743548 (TOP-RMS tuning)</p><p>This describes how to take any JI interval and convert it to an interval of the temperament. If you take the first generator to be 600.002686 cents, and the second one as 162.742975 cents (usually we call these the &quot;period&quot; and the &quot;generator&quot;), the first three numbers of the generator mapping describe how many 600.0-cent periods to approximate the primes 2, 3, and 5, when combined with the number of 162.7-cent generators specified by the second group of three numbers. For example:</p><p>2/1: 2 * 600.0 + 0 * 162.7 = 1200.0 cents<br/>5/1: 6 * 600.0 - 5 * 162.7 = 2786.3 cents.<br/>3/2: (1-2) * 600.0 + (8-0) * 162.7 = 701.9 cents.</p><p>These generator mappings are very useful for identifying and studying the properties of temperaments, although they&apos;re not unique (they depend on which intervals are chosen for the generators). These days we typically have a convention where the first generator is an octave or 1/n of an octave, and the second generator is less than half the size of the first one.</p><p>&gt;&gt; 14 notes per octave is a good size for hedgehog.<br/>&gt; &gt; If I understand it well, you mean an octave-periodic linear temperament with &gt; a generator being the &quot;slightly-more-than-neutral&quot; second, is that it?

It&apos;s an optimized tuning of the generators, which minimizes the maximum error (weighted by the logarithms of the primes, so that e.g. 2/1 is more accurate than 3/1). TOP-RMS is a similar optimization which minimizes the RMS (root mean square) error instead of the maximum error. TOP stands for &quot;Tenney Optimal&quot;, as it&apos;s based on Tenney&apos;s &quot;Harmonic Distance&quot;.</p><p>I have some explanation of regular temperaments on my web page, although some of the terminology may be out of date, and it doesn&apos;t really go into the details of how to use the generator mapping as I&apos;ve explained above.</p><p><a href="http://www.io.com/~hmiller/music/regular-temperaments.html">http://www.io.com/~hmiller/music/regular-temperaments.html</a></p><p>Also some brief MIDI examples of a handful of these temperaments:</p><p><a href="http://www.io.com/~hmiller/music/zireen-music.html">http://www.io.com/~hmiller/music/zireen-music.html</a></p><p>Paul Erlich&apos;s paper &quot;A Middle Path&quot; is a good general explanation of this approach to regular temperaments, and includes many useful diagrams.</p><p><a href="http://eceserv0.ece.wisc.edu/~sethares/paperspdf/Erlich-MiddlePath.pdf">http://eceserv0.ece.wisc.edu/~sethares/paperspdf/Erlich-MiddlePath.pdf</a></p></div><h3><a id=74658 href="#74658">ðŸ”—</a>Petr Pa&#x159;&#xED;zek &#x3C;p.parizek@chello.cz&#x3E;</h3><span>12/12/2007 12:03:58 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Herman wrote:</p><p>&gt; with example tunings for the generators:<br/>&gt; P = 600.002686, G = 162.742975 (TOP tuning of the generators)<br/>&gt; P = 600.003398, G = 162.743548 (TOP-RMS tuning)</p><p>If this is the case, then I&apos;ve actually played the piece in kwasy, didn&apos;t I?

The reason why these numbers were so unclear to me was simply that I usually do it, when writing my own linear temperament schemes, always in exactly the opposite way -- one pair of numbers per line, the first of which is the number of periods required and the second one is the number of generators. Don&apos;t know if there&apos;s any general preference for either way or if it&apos;s like fifty-fifty. But for me the method you describe is less clear, even though it&apos;s nothing more than essentially turning mine 90 degrees. :-D Maybe it is, indeed, just because I&apos;m not used to it, who knows?</p><p>Petr</p></div><h3><a id=74664 href="#74664">ðŸ”—</a>Herman Miller &#x3C;hmiller@IO.COM&#x3E;</h3><span>12/12/2007 7:55:30 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Petr Pa&dcaron;&zdot;&dblac;&dcaron;&zdot;&dblac;zek wrote:<br/>&gt; Herman wrote:<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt; with example tunings for the generators:<br/>&gt;&gt; P = 600.002686, G = 162.742975 (TOP tuning of the generators)<br/>&gt;&gt; P = 600.003398, G = 162.743548 (TOP-RMS tuning)<br/>&gt; &gt; If this is the case, then I&apos;ve actually played the piece in kwasy, didn&apos;t I? &gt; Why should be 5 generators &quot;ruling out kwasy&quot;?</p><p>The difference between hedgehog and kwasy is not the exact tuning, but how the notes are used to approximate ratios of small integers.</p><p>[&lt;2, 1, 6], &lt;0, 8, -5]&gt;</p><p>is the generator mapping for kwasy, which means to get a fifth, you need at least 9 notes per half-octave period (or 18 in all per octave):</p><p>3/2 is 1 period down (1 - 2) and 8 generators up (8 - 0).
