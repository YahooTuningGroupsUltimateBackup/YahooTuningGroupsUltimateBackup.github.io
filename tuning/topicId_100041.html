The simple minor chords could actually be thought of as having note frequencies multiples of 3, 5, and 15 (A-flat, C, E-flat  a minor chord but with frequencies integral multiples of 1, 8*1; 5, 2*5; and 15) and they have a powerful psychological effect, so I included them.</p><p>&#x9;Notes with frequencies proportional to 13 - &quot;Saturns&quot; probably should be in there, but I had difficulty in my own mind getting a solid feel for their place in chords and harmony, and I&apos;ve deferred them to when I could really honestly grapple with them, so others will need to deal with them I think, as my time and health and energy are slipping from my hands.</p><p>&#x9;I hope I&apos;ve contributed something that at least someone will find of interest and offering at least some item they can &quot;sink their teeth into&quot;.</p><p>Best wishes,   Ralph David Hill</p></div>
