However, it&apos;s possible to argue that<br/>Vicentino may have favored in practice a form of 1/4-comma meantone<br/>considered equivalent to the division of the whole-tone into five<br/>equal tones.</p><p>Vicentino&apos;s instructions that the first 12 notes on the archicembalo<br/>(Eb-G#) should be tuned as in common practice suggests a circulating<br/>31-note system based on 1/4-comma meantone.</p><p>At the same time, his division of the whole-tone into five &quot;minor<br/>dieses&quot; not distinguished in size makes his scheme equivalent at a<br/>certain theoretical level to 31-tET, with which Lemme Rossi equated it<br/>in his treatise of 1666 giving string ratios for this tuning to within<br/>about a tenth of a cent.</p><p>Maybe this is a question of level of description. In figuring<br/>intervals on a 24-note archicembalo arrangement in 1/4-comma meantone,<br/>I often count in &quot;fifthtones,&quot; recognizing but conveniently<br/>overlooking the distinction between larger and smaller fifthtones at<br/>around 41 and 35 cents (together making up the chromatic semitone of<br/>around 76 cents).</p><p>One approach to this question might be: &quot;Does 31-tET simply imply a<br/>conceptual division of the whole-tone into five equal parts, or does it<br/>imply deliberately tempering the major third to make it very slightly<br/>impure and thus distinct from 1/4-comma?&quot;</p><p>If the former, then Vicentino&apos;s system can certainly be described as<br/>31-tET, as scholars such as Maria Rika Maniates and Claude Palisca<br/>have recently done in their fine translation of Vicentino&apos;s _Ancient<br/>Music Adopted to Modern Practice_ (1996). So can Fabio Colonna&apos;s<br/>31-note tuning of 1618, which he likewise notes divides the whole-tone<br/>into five equal parts.</p><p>If the latter, then Vicentino doesn&apos;t seem to make any distinction between<br/>the tuning of the first 12 notes in the two systems (31-note division of<br/>the octave; 19-note tuning in a similar temperament with pure fifths added<br/>for a form of Paul Erlich and others have termed &quot;adaptive 5-limit JI&quot;).<br/>Similarly, Colonna says that the first 12 or 19 notes or his 31-note<br/>system are tuned as on smaller keyboard instruments, again suggesting a<br/>circulating 1/4-comma meantone.</p><p>Personally I tend to regard both Vicentino and Colonna as representing<br/>&quot;a circulating 1/4-comma meantone almost equivalent to a literal<br/>31-tET&quot; rather than vice-versa, but this may be matter of viewpoint.<br/>Rossi may have been the first theorist to state the slight<br/>mathematical difference.</p><p>Incidentally, I&apos;m not aware of allusions in Vicentino to 19-tET;<br/>Guillaume Costeley (1570) may be the first to describe this<br/>temperament.</p><p>Most respectfully,</p><p>Margo Schulter<br/><a href="mailto:mschulter@value.net">mschulter@value.net</a></p></div>
