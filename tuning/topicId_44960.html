There is a lot to work with, as long as your interest is in algorithmic composition. But you can play midi files, etc., so it needn&apos;t end up being aleatoric, either. KeyKit hasn&apos;t been supported/developed in a pretty long time, but I think it isn&apos;t well-known enough.</p><p>My guess is that it won&apos;t run on a mac that old, but only one way to find out...</p><p>Cheers,<br/>Jon</p></div>
