If the &quot;another&quot;<br/>&gt;&gt;group was responding to &quot;either&quot; the sharp or the flat tunings, we still<br/>&gt;&gt;don&apos;t know whether they might have preferred some other tuning. Perhaps the<br/>&gt;&gt;&quot;another&quot; group were lumped together as simply &quot;wrong.&quot; (Many questions<br/>&gt;&gt;unanswered here.)</p><p>Paul replied:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; There were 5 options: (a) 30 cents flat, (b) 15 cents flat, (c) just, (d) 15<br/>&gt; cents sharp, (e) 30 cents sharp. One group always preferred (c), gave<br/>&gt; intermediate ratings to (b) and (d), and low ratings to (a) and (e). The<br/>&gt; other group always preferred (b) and (d), gave intermediate ratings to (c),<br/>&gt; and low ratings to (a) and (e).</p><p>Thanks, Paul for the added info. Evidently, no other &quot;consonant&quot; thirds<br/>(than 4:5) were presented for evaluation. Therefore, this experiment doesn&apos;t<br/>really speak to the question of preference for, let&apos;s say, the 4:5 third,<br/>the 12-tET third or the &quot;high third&quot; (whatever that turns out to be). Also,<br/>as I mentioned earlier, the respondents here are listeners, not singers--a<br/>substantially different perceptual process, I believe, since the latter are<br/>much more actively involved in &quot;preferring&quot;--indeed, creating--the tuning.</p><p>Any grad students out there in need of a topic?</p><p>Jerry</p></div>
