<a href="/tuning">back to list</a><h1>a website I recently found</h1><h3>Danny Wier &#x3C;dawiertx@sbcglobal.net&#x3E;</h3><span>4/29/2004 12:19:50 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>The homepage of On Classical:</p><p><a href="http://www.kunstderfuge.com">http://www.kunstderfuge.com</a></p><p>It&apos;s a resource of classical MIDI files with a small but growing library of<br/>MP3 and WMA recordings. There&apos;s a greater emphasis on fugues here as well.<br/>Some of them are already tuned to a historical tuning (Bach&apos;s Well-Tempered<br/>Klavier in Werckmeister III, for instance, and there might be some early<br/>music in meantone), but most MIDI files can be retuned with Scala anyway.</p><p>The nice thing about this website is that unlike the Classical MIDI<br/>Archives, there&apos;s no download limit, and you don&apos;t have to register your<br/>e-mail address. I recommend Bunji Hisamori&apos;s sequences of Beethoven&apos;s piano<br/>sonantas and Chopin&apos;s third piano sonata (but not his second). Many Bach<br/>compositions sound really good in meantone, the ones that don&apos;t end up with<br/>wolves anyway.</p><p>Unfortuately, many 20th century works aren&apos;t available because of copyright<br/>issues; only public domain works can be downloaded. Also, it doesn&apos;t have<br/>anywhere near as many files as Classical MIDI Archives yet.</p><p>(I am in no way associated with this website. I just like it a lot.)</p></div>
