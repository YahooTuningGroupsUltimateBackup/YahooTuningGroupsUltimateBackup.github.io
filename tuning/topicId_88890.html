I would be curious to know the impressions of a pionnier of harmonic temperaments like Andreas Sparchuh&apos;s, or of Johnny Reinhard for the rendition of WIII, but to me and with the harmonies you used, there&apos;s no mistake. Have you tried different tunings on this score ?<br/>3) certainly you took not much risk by choosing this tuning and one can object this isn&apos;t a very &quot;microtonal&quot; demo, and I hope too we will be hearing more adventurous and exotic experiences, but I think that was a clever choice to start by something very classic, that I think has a microtonal quality coming from a right adequation between the music and the tuning chosen.<br/>BTW I did not succed to hear your precedent experiment with celtic instruments, was that intended to be a finished demo ? If so, can you send it to me ?<br/>4) it is enjoyable and has melodic qualities, the most interesting part to me beeing in  the middle, where it goes more chromatic with &quot;Beatlesque&quot; chords. It can be hesitant sometimes, but why not - I like how it breathes, and plays with silences.<br/>5) it&apos;s well mixed and has a very good stereo space. Did you used the Ethno reverb, or some other ?<br/>(the only reserve I have does not come from you, but from the attacks of the guitar sometimes harsh or irregular in volume, perhaps from the expression adjustements).</p><p>Carry on and all the best Chris !<br/>- - - - - - -<br/>Jacques</p></div><h3>Chris Vaisvil &#x3C;chrisvaisvil@...&#x3E;</h3><span>5/8/2010 7:45:51 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Thank you Jacques for the comments and listen - and I&apos;m glad you like it.</p><p>I was seduced by the sounds to be honest :-)</p><p>Let me try to answer your questions - see my responses below your comments.</p><p>On Sat, May 8, 2010 at 10:24 AM, Jacques Dudon &lt;fotosonix@...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Chris wrote :<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Thanks for the listen and comment Oz!<br/>&gt; One does not always please the audience :-)<br/>&gt; I guess I should have been more cautious since I liked it - sure sign of<br/>&gt; something wrong :-)<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Sorry if I &quot;infringe&quot; from my reserve as a member from the jury ;),<br/>&gt; but I like it myself, for many reasons :<br/>&gt; 1) it&apos;s the first demo proposal and I think it&apos;s a piece of quality ;</p><p>Well, actually this is meant as being only an improvisation.

I missed that ! Done with Ethno ?! That&apos;s really good.<br/>Likewise I suppose other meantones could give good results.<br/>I think of Michemine(E3), Hummy(NA4), Lucie(OCE2), Diatess(SA3), or much more exotic, Sireine(OCE5)(-??)<br/>If in the proper tonality of course.<br/>Anyway Mezzo works well. But I dont know if I will even try to listen to the ET or even synchronous-12 version !<br/>I am interested in your comments if you experiment it sometime with differents tunings than Mezzo !<br/>Keep on having a good time,<br/>- - - - - - -<br/>Jacques</p></div>
