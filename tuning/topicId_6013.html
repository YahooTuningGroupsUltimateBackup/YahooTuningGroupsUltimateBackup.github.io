What I was initially<br/>interested in here was trying to &apos;soften up&apos; 8e in a particular piece<br/>that I was working on... so for example, the 1 (i.e., 1/8th of an<br/>octave) would put the fifth in the third position of the fourths<br/>column in 8e:</p><p>     0<br/>1050   150<br/> 900   300<br/> 750   450<br/> 600   600</p><p>so I tried taking the N/D &amp; n of ((LOG(N)-LOG(D))*(1200/LOG(2^n)) as<br/>4/3 &amp; 3, and got:</p><p> 166 166 166 166 38 166 166 166<br/>0 166 332 498 664 702 868 1034 1200</p><p>or:</p><p> 166 166 166 38 166 166 166 166<br/>0 166 332 498 536 702 868 1034 1200</p><p>when taken as 7 (the inversion at 1050&#xFFFD;) where N/D=6/1 &amp; n=3... Of<br/>course this could also be seen as the fifth in the third position of<br/>the fifths column where N/D=3/2 &amp; n=3:</p><p> 234 234 30 204 30 204 30 234<br/>0 234 468 498 702 732 936 966 1200</p><p>...And so on and forth I went, on and on through a bunch of different<br/>variations on this process, and eventually I did end up using:</p><p>3:8 / 2<br/> 204 147 147 57 147 147 204 147<br/>0 204 351 498 555 702 849 1053 1200</p><p>and</p><p>1:6 / 7<br/> 129 130 184 130 129 184 130 184<br/>0 129 259 443 573 702 886 1016 1200</p><p>But the process hadn&apos;t worked out in quite the way I had originally<br/>envisioned it, so I put it aside for another day (as I did realize<br/>that there seemed to be an awful lot of potential uses for the general<br/>processes I was looking out).</p><p>And while I suppose that you could look at this as some sort of<br/>reverse tempering -- as 12-tone equal temperament could be seen as<br/>((LOG(N)-LOG(D))*(x/LOG(2^y)) where N/D=3/2, x=12, and y=1 -- it is<br/>also just another way to render an endless variety of meantone like<br/>tunings (e.g., ((LOG(5)-LOG(1))*(1200/LOG(2^4)) and<br/>((LOG(3)-LOG(1))*(1200/LOG(2^6)) being synonymous with 1/4 comma and<br/>1/6 kleisma, etc.).</p><p>So my question is -- as I&apos;m starting to look at this process again --<br/>is to what extent others here might have looked at this way of<br/>shuffling linear temperaments... and what sorts of results they might<br/>have gotten...</p><p>Dan</p></div><h3><a id=6015 href="#6015">ðŸ”—</a>Paul H.
