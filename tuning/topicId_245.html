In practice, of course, all kinds of things can happen.<br/>I do think that Boomslitter and Creel comes closer than any idea I know of<br/>to a theory of melody, but their work was very limited and incomplete.  I<br/>think the Pythagorean diatonic comes closest to describing Barbershop<br/>melodies, with inflections of two types: (1) from the 12-tone Pythagorean<br/>cycle  (2) with the usual tendency of singers to tune passing tones from a<br/>harmonic series between two strong tones.</p><p>[Charlie Jordan]<br/>&gt;&gt;Being four-part, it is flexible to write for and a joy to listen to (as a<br/>&gt;&gt;composer, I find 4-part writing perhaps my favorite).<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;Have there been compositions for Barbershop quintet, or do the Beach Boys<br/>&gt;hold a patent on 5-part vocal harmony?</p><p>No, Barbershop is strictly a four-part style.

Seriously, what does the invention of 12-tET have<br/>&gt;to do with what Barbershopers sing?</p><p>12-tET is everywhere.</p><p>&gt;I&apos;m not familiar with Forte, or with a good definition of &quot;functional<br/>&gt;harmony&quot;.  But I know what a dominant chord is.  Barbershop music contains<br/>&gt;plenty of them, often tuned 4:5:6:7.  It also contains tetrads which are<br/>&gt;not dominant chords, and are tuned 4:5:6:7, and in fact this latter type of<br/>&gt;chord is at least as plentiful as the former type in the typical Barbershop<br/>&gt;performance.</p><p>Really? They&apos;re not secondary dominants or deceptive dominants? Can you give<br/>an example?</p><p>&gt;The answer is no, but I take that as far less of an indicator than what&apos;s<br/>&gt;been going on during the rest of the tune.</p><p>Well then please clarify.</p></div>
