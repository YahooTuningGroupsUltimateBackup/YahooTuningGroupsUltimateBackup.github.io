The spokes were plucked like harp strings and amplified. It&apos;s very<br/>like choosing some ratios or notes at random. Also based a sketch on the<br/>ratios between front and rear sprockets.</p><p>Mark</p><p>Christopher Bailey &lt;<a href="mailto:cb202@columbia.edu">cb202@columbia.edu</a>&gt; wrote:</p><p>&gt;Yes, but it&apos;s important to note that even with a high degree of formalism,<br/>&gt;there can still be lots of room for &quot;freewheeling allegoric whirls.&quot;  As a<br/>&gt;composer, this is my favorite state to work in:  it&apos;s like junk sculpture,<br/>&gt;I&apos;m given some fairly tightly constraining garbage, perhaps a bizarre and<br/>&gt;random collection of it,   and I have to make cool music out of<br/>&gt;it.  I love composing this way.  It may not always work out best for the<br/>&gt;listener, and that I&apos;m well aware of,  but as composer it&apos;s a lot of fun.</p></div>
