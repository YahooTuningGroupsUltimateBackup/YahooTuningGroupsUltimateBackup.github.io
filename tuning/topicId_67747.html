I am trying to interpret what<br/>this remark means and whether it can really tell us anything about the<br/>tunings used at that period.</p><p>My suspicion is that it is a symptom of the persistence of the old<br/>theory that whole tones were made up of 9 commas. I think it is well<br/>established that the 53-division corresponding closely to Pythagorean<br/>intonation, in which the tone is also 9 units, was known for a long<br/>time. Aaron for example mentioned that the tone was divided into four<br/>dieses and a comma, with one semitone getting two dieses and the other<br/>the rest, the comma also being one ninth of a tone.</p><p>Now this theory is of course not appropriate for meantone tunings.<br/>However, the division of the tone into a smaller and a larger semitone<br/>persisted from the Middle Ages into the meantone era, thus anyone who<br/>carried on teaching the old theory of 4+5 division could not have been<br/>proved obviously (or audibly) wrong unless a test was made on a very<br/>precisely marked monochord. Even then the correct division of a tone<br/>into 9 parts would be beyond the geometrical methods of the day. The<br/>use of logarithms in the 17th century would make it possible to find<br/>such divisions very precisely, but I think virtually no ordinary<br/>musicians would do so (which would also require considerable work in<br/>marking out the intervals very precisly on a monochord).</p><p>The big difference is the diatonic semitones (E-F and B-C) which were<br/>small in Pythagorean and large in meantone. But it may easily be that<br/>the theoretical 9-comma division survived this shift unscathed. When<br/>Telemann &apos;invented&apos; - actually reinvented - 55-EDO he made the<br/>assumption that these diatonic semitones were the larger size. Sauveur<br/>based his EDO systems on having 7 larger and 5 smaller semitones in<br/>the octave - also a correct assumption for the meantone era.</p><p>Starting from the old (and at that time quantitatively untestable)<br/>theory of 9 commas, taking some music textbooks or theoreticians at<br/>their word rather than trying to actually measure what musicians did,<br/>Sauveur would easily end up with 55 comma-like divisions in the octave<br/>- which neatly enough approximated syntonic commas.</p><p>So Sauveur&apos;s claim that 55-EDO was used by &apos;ordinary musicians&apos; would<br/>be comprehensible even if no musicians actually used that system to<br/>tune or play in. Sauveur&apos;s obituary pointed out that he relied on the<br/>ears and knowledge of others, since before starting his investigations<br/>he had known nothing of music. If people were being taught that the<br/>semitones were 4 and 5 commas Sauveur might well have noted it down<br/>and believed it true of all ordinary musicians.</p><p>If in fact quarter-comma (for example) had been the norm then still it<br/>would have been difficult to disprove the 9-comma theory in its 55-EDO<br/>guise - *until* Sauveur had actually compared 55-EDO with the pure<br/>intervals and deduced what degree of temperament thirds and fifths<br/>actually had. This would require the use of logarithms to divide the<br/>octave into 55 parts - which I think is very unlikely anyone did<br/>before Sauveur.</p><p>In fact in 1707 Sauveur explicitly noted the 31-EDO of Huyghens as<br/>being close to quarter-comma - which he called &apos;the tempered system<br/>which everyone uses&apos;!</p><p>What would be very interesting is if anyone before Sauveur referred to<br/>a 55-division, or said explicitly that the tone was divided into 4<br/>plus 5 parts and the diatonic semitone was 5 parts?</p><p>What Sauveur said in 1701 would be good to know too, though I&apos;m<br/>waiting for that article on order.</p><p>~~~T~~~</p></div><h3>threesixesinarow &#x3C;CACCOLA@NET1PLUS.COM&#x3E;</h3><span>10/19/2006 3:33:16 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;Tom Dent&quot; &lt;stringph@...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; In 1707, and possibly a few years before, Sauveur mentioned 55-EDO<br/>as<br/>&gt; the system used by &apos;ordinary musicians&apos;.
