Maybe it is semantic: when _you_ say musicologists, you<br/>mean those who only write on music, but don&apos;t practice it.<br/>(Paralleling G. B.

What seems clear is a lawyer-like attitude that wants to remove emotions from the material like with a science.</p><p>When I studied Renaissance Theory it was forbidden to actually listen to an 81/64.  The professor would only allow that the complexity of the numbers are enough to indicate the dissonance of this interval as compared to a 5/4.  Man, people choked when I took out a Korg tuner to play the interval.  Somehow there was a perverse joy in running the class without actually listening to the intervals being discussed.</p><p>and what a battle to get tuning to be included.  musicologists were trying to kick me out of the class for being an ethnomusicologist...what a crock, I wasn&apos;t &quot;supposed&quot; to be interested in renaissance music.  That&apos;s like Europeans thinking I have no business in Bach since I&apos;m an American.</p><p>&gt; Since I studied musicology at Columbia University, it seems a clear<br/>cut difference in approach.</p><p>JS:  I have no idea what that means.</p><p>It means that I was a fish out of water.  I was the &quot;microtonalist&quot; hearing things ungodly.  In every issue I wanted a value for moving music forward, but I was alone in this.  From the start I saw little future in musicology as it had been constructed.  Of course, academic departments and subdisciplines are continually challenging each other.  At Columbia, the &quot;communist&quot; anthropology department were full of negativity for ethnomusicologists.</p><p>&gt; And of course there are musicians and musicains, and musicologists<br/>and musiclogists, always exceptions</p><p>JS:  ???</p><p>Cheers,<br/>Jon</p><p>JR:  I&apos;m just (funny errors) saying there are individuals who are not like the others.  I love Arthur Mendel, George Buelow, Christoph Wolff, Richard Taruskin, people who have their finger in the musical pulse of history.</p><p>Hope this helps further to distinguish thoughts about one discipline by someone in another.</p><p>best, Johnny<br/>________________________________________________________________________<br/>Check out the new AOL.

I confess that in many areas, it<br/>still isn&apos;t really clear what discerns you from &quot;musicologists&quot;. There<br/>seem to be various levels of musical (performance) involvement, but it<br/>is hard to be sure just where you have your biggest differences. If it<br/>boils down to academicians who never play the music, I suppose that<br/>makes some kind of sense, but surely there are musicologists that *do*<br/>immerse themselves in the music, and therefore berating musicologists<br/>as a group doesn&apos;t seem totally appropriate.</p><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, Afmmjr@... wrote:<br/>&gt; JR:  It is not so simple, alas.</p><p>Life rarely is, which is why I&apos;m trying to understand your position.</p><p>&gt; First off, there are all different levels of instrumental playing.</p><p>Sure. This must imply that you feel superior to &apos;them&apos;.</p><p>&gt; Also, the majority of musicologists seem to be pianists.  This skews<br/>thinking when you come from a bassoon head, for example, let alone<br/>recorder, composer, etc.</p><p>&quot;Seem to be&quot; is always a tenuous position to put out there, but I<br/>don&apos;t know how the percentages go. Then again, Bach wasn&apos;t a<br/>bassoonist, etc. You certainly have a different, possibly unique-ish<br/>perspective, but what makes it more valid than another instrumental or<br/>vocal perspective?</p><p>&gt; JR: So true, but the Ives story should have the Partch story all beat.</p><p>I have no idea what that means..</p><p>&gt; JR:  People may have dabbled in youth, who knows.</p><p>Or they may still be serious performers, who knows?</p><p>&gt; What seems clear is a lawyer-like attitude that wants to remove<br/>emotions from the material like with a science.</p><p>Possibly, but you aren&apos;t going to convince many people of a historical<br/>fact or occurrence based on your emotional reactions to music!</p><p>&gt; It means that I was a fish out of water.</p><p>I see. From your statement I couldn&apos;t tell if the program at Columbia<br/>was a good or bad thing, but it is clear now. Is there any place on<br/>earth you could study that would be in line with your manner of<br/>thinking? Has there been any movement in your direction (I&apos;m assuming<br/>Columbia was many years ago)?</p><p>&gt; Hope this helps further to distinguish thoughts about one discipline<br/>by someone in another.</p><p>Sure, I have a slightly clearer picture.</p><p>Cheers,<br/>Jon</p></div><h3><a id=68594 href="#68594">ðŸ”—</a>Cris Forster &#x3C;cris.forster@comcast.net&#x3E;</h3><span>12/29/2006 12:49:41 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>&gt; Jon Szanto writes:<br/>&gt; Certainly.
