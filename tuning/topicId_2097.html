Mine has two octaves of frets in a chromatic scale<br/>which sounds pretty much like 12-tone equal temperament.</p><p>There is a picture of a pipa and some very basic information on<br/>how to tune it (no details on intonation) on the page:</p><p><a href="http://www.cs.ust.hk/icmc99/virtuosi.html">http://www.cs.ust.hk/icmc99/virtuosi.html</a></p><p>Some other Chinese intstruments are there as well.</p><p>Best,</p><p>Lydia Ayers</p></div>
