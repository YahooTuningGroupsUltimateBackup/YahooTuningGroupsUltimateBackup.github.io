Zappa is the one of the most significant american<br/>composers ever. I agree that both Partch and Zappa had a kinship in their<br/>biting cynicism for the American Dream but that&apos;s all I&apos;ll grant ya. Yes I<br/>would consider him a heavy in the sampling department--having his &quot;rock group&quot;<br/>sample bits of stravinsky,penderecki, and even motown at a seconds notice<br/>definitely predates the sampling era....I don&apos;t know if that&apos;s where you&apos;re<br/>goin on this one but this whole discussion reeks of the Partch Cult trying to<br/>claim Zappas brilliance from some 10 second clip. He did extensively use<br/>marimbas though maybe someone should ask Ruth Underwood about this<br/>Zappa/partch connection<br/>P</p><p>Kraig Grady wrote:</p><p>&gt; From: Kraig Grady &lt;<a href="mailto:kraiggrady@anaphoria.com">kraiggrady@anaphoria.com</a>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; <a href="mailto:monz@juno.com">monz@juno.com</a> wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; Another thing to remember is that in the late 1960s Partch<br/>&gt; &gt; had been living in Venice Beach and other places around LA,<br/>&gt; &gt; where Zappa was based.
