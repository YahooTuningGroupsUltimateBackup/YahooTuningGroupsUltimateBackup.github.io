In fact, you could say the establishment&apos;s resistance of<br/> xenharmonics is to a degree, xenophobia.<br/>  &gt;&gt;</p><p>It&apos;s unfortunate that _xenos_ is translated as &quot;strange&quot;, as that leads to<br/>other associations in English (some of which may have well, however, been<br/>usefully applied to Ivor Darreg&apos;s music).  Other, more accurate,<br/>possibilities would be &quot;alien&quot; or &quot;foreign&quot;, but again, this leads to some<br/>negative associations.  I prefer the term &quot;unfamiliar&quot;, because it has the<br/>additional advantage of allowing one to consider the _xenharmonic_ to be a<br/>temporary classification. I trust that all of us are trying to make these<br/>tunings more familiar rather than less, and eventually one may usefully focus<br/>on a more (small c) catholic art of _harmonics_, or just plain _tuning_,<br/>absent the _xen_.</p><p>(If you happen not to come from a Zen-Catholic Californian family with fond<br/>memories of the Jerry Brown governorship, the please excuse the last pun).</p></div>
