Part of the problem I&apos;m trying to get at<br/>  is in the title of this thread. Whenever I&apos;ve seen it used, &quot;Kleismic<br/>  Temperament&quot; means a temperament in which the Kleisma vanishes. So<br/>  shouldn&apos;t &quot;Kleismic Yarman Temperament&quot; refer to a temperament in<br/>  which the &quot;Yarman Kleisma&quot; vanishes?

But first a terminological point. &quot;Kleismic&quot; seems to be a<br/>word invented by Graham Breed. Perhaps referred to as &quot;kleismatic&quot; by<br/>others earlier. Either way, if it refers to temperament, it&apos;s a<br/>temperament where 15652:15552 vanishes. I like &quot;Hanson&quot; for this, as<br/>you can see (along with much info on it) in the paper I mailed you,<br/>because the late Larry Hanson seems to have been the first to write<br/>about this as a distinct class of tuning systems.</p><p>&gt; 386.313714 cents + 3.032314 cents = 389.346028 cents</p><p>This is just 5:4 * 4000:3993, or 5000:3993.</p><p>&gt; Subtract two Ptolemy commas (2*100:99=10000:9801) from a pure third<br/>&gt;tempered thus (389.346028 cents - 34.798967 cents = 354.547061 cents)</p><p>This is just 5000:3993 / 10000:9801, or 27:22.</p><p>&gt; Add a major whole tone to the undecimal neutral second  (9:8 *<br/>&gt;12:11= 27:22 Zalzal Wosta = 354.547060 cents)</p><p>And that&apos;s another way of getting 27:22.</p><p>So, what do these various JI relationships tell you? And what do they<br/>have to do with temperament?</p><p>Anyhow, if you&apos;re going to make 4000:3993 disappear -- that is,<br/>temper it out -- you&apos;ll probably want to temper prime 5 narrow, since<br/>5 is a factor of the larger number in the ratio (4000). What you want<br/>is for the tuning of the primes to be adjusted so that &apos;4000&apos;<br/>= &apos;3993&apos;. Then you&apos;ll have a bona-fide temperament based on the<br/>vanishing of 4000:3999. If you keep the octaves (prime 2) pure, this<br/>means that the 5:4 will be tempered narrow. But if you allow the<br/>octaves to be tempered too, you&apos;d probably narrow them as well (since<br/>2 is a factor of 4000), so 5:4 might end up either wide or narrow<br/>depending on how you&apos;re doing the tempering.</p><p>Please do excuse my manner again . . . I hope you&apos;ll get a chance to<br/>reread the paper I sent you. It sets forth the basic concepts of<br/>temperament with the examples most basic and central to Western<br/>practice -- 12-tone equal temperament (understood as making<br/>531441:524288 vanish), and meantone temperament (understood as making<br/>81:80). That might make these more exotic ideas of ours a little less<br/>elusive.</p><p>And I apologize, yet again, for I have not had a chance to compliment<br/>you for your incredible work in music and theory, and for your<br/>obvious intelligence in assimilating so many new ideas so quickly, as<br/>demonstrated on and off this list.

That way you end up with tuning systems with<br/>fewer notes, and fewer interval sizes, than would be required in JI.</p><p>Kyle Gann has a mostly reasonable page on Western historical tunings<br/>that may help make this less abstract:</p><p><a href="http://home.earthlink.net/~kgann/histune.html">http://home.earthlink.net/~kgann/histune.html</a></p><p>&gt; As to your question, I deem the JI ratio of Zalzal Wusta a<br/>&gt;significant element in the construction of many maqams, as in the<br/>&gt;tetrachord:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; 1/1<br/>&gt; 9/8<br/>&gt; 27/22<br/>&gt; 4/3<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Play it like this, and you have a Usshaq genre:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; 4/3 27/22 9/8 1/1 9/8<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; If I were to temper the 4000:3993 kleisma that results from<br/>&gt;comparing 27:22 to a whole tone minus two Ptolemy commas, I figure<br/>&gt;that would somewhat justify the inclination of Zalzal Wusta to the<br/>&gt;whole tone ratios as demonstrated above.</p><p>I&apos;m completely lost. Where do the two Ptolemy commas come in,<br/>musically speaking? And what inclination to the whole tone ratios do<br/>you speak of? Can you write a much longer paragraph elaborating on<br/>the above?</p><p>&gt; Can you now give an example of a &grave;bona fide&grave; temperament where<br/>&gt;4000:3993 vanishes?</p><p>If you start with 11-limit Just Intonation, which is 5-dimensional<br/>{2,3,5,7,11}, and temper out 4000:3993, you end up with a 4-<br/>dimensional temperament which (in one optimized form) can be<br/>constructed from these four generators, in cents: g1=1200., g2=-<br/>165.9852708, g3=2785.912380, g4=3368.915093.</p><p>Prime 2 is being approximated, trivially, by the g1, 1200 cents.</p><p>Prime 3 is approximated by 2*g1 + 3*g2: 2*1200 - 3*165.9852708 =<br/>1902.0441876 cents.</p><p>Prime 5 is approximated by g3, 2785.912380 cents.</p><p>Prime 7 is approximated by the g4, 3368.915093 cents. In fact you can<br/>leave this generator out altogether, and have a 3-dimensional system,<br/>if you&apos;re only interested in {2,3,5,11}-JI and its temperaments.</p><p>Prime 11 is approximated by g1 - g2 + g3: 1200 + 165.9852708 +<br/>2785.912380 = 4151.8976508 cents.</p><p>Other optimizations will lead to slightly different values for these<br/>four generators. But the key point to notice is that no matter how<br/>you choose the generators, the representation of 4000:3993 will<br/>vanish. Why? 4000 is 2*2*2*2*2*5*5*5, or 2^5 * 5^3. So in terms of<br/>the generators above, it will be</p><p>5*g1 + 3*g3</p><p>Do you follow?</p><p>Meanwhile, 3993 is 3*11*11*11, or 3^1 * 11^3. So in terms of the<br/>generators above, it will be</p><p>2*g1 + 3*g2 + 3*(g1 - g2 + g3)<br/>= 2*g1 + 3*g2 + 3*g1 - 3*g2 + 3*g3<br/>= 5*g1 + 3*g3.</p><p>Still following?</p><p>Thus 4000 amounts to the same thing as 3993 in any tuning system that<br/>approximates the primes in this way. So 4000:3993 would be<br/>represented by 5*g1 + 3*g3 - (5*g1 + 3*g3) = 0; i.e., it vanishes.</p><p>The only other ratios that vanish in such a system are powers of<br/>4000:3993 -- 16000000:15944049, 64000000000:63664587657,<br/>256000000000000:254212698514401, etc. No other ratios vanish in this<br/>system.</p><p>If you don&apos;t mind that other ratios vanish as well as 4000:3993 and<br/>its powers, here are some other temperaments of 11-limit JI:</p><p>3-dimensional:<br/>() 540:539 /\ 4000:3993 (generators 600, 433.9278373, 2785.854450<br/>cents)</p><p>2-dimensional:<br/>() Wizard (generators 600, ~217 cents)<br/>() Octoid (generators 150, ~16 cents)<br/>() 385:384 /\ 2401:2400 /\ 4000:3993 (generators 1200, ~583 cents)<br/>() 225:224 /\ 385:384 /\ 4000:3993 (generators 600, ~383.2 cents)<br/>() 243:242 /\ 385:384 /\ 4000:3993 (generators 1200, ~516.68 cents)<br/>() 225:224 /\ 243:242 /\ 4000:3993 (generators 1200, ~516.69 cents)</p><p>1-dimensional:<br/>() 72-tone equal temperament<br/>() 311-tone equal temperament</p><p>I stole most of this information from Gene&apos;s posts on tuning-math;<br/>any errors are of course my fault.</p><p>Let&apos;s verify that 4000:3993 vanishes in 72-tone equal temperament. In<br/>72-tone equal temperament, prime 2 is approximated by 72 steps, prime<br/>3 is approximated by 114 steps, prime 5 is appproximated by 167<br/>steps, (prime 7 is approximated by 202 steps,) and prime 11 is<br/>approximated by 249 steps. So 4000, or 2^5 * 5^3, will be represented<br/>by 5*72 + 3*167 = 861 steps, while 3993, or 3^1 * 11^3, will be<br/>represented by 114 + 3*249 = 861 steps. Hence 4000:3993 will be<br/>represented by 0 steps, hence vanish, in 72-equal.</p><p>Please come back to me with questions about any or all of this -- I<br/>hope to help you understand all this, and will spend as much time<br/>clarifying as need be.</p></div><h3><a id=57219 href="#57219">ðŸ”—</a>Gene Ward Smith &#x3C;genewardsmith@coolgoose.com&#x3E;</h3><span>3/3/2005 10:07:36 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;wallyesterpaulrus&quot;<br/>&lt;wallyesterpaulrus@y...&gt; wrote:</p><p>&gt; &gt; Can you now give an example of a &grave;bona fide&grave; temperament where<br/>&gt; &gt;4000:3993 vanishes?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; If you start with 11-limit Just Intonation, which is 5-dimensional<br/>&gt; {2,3,5,7,11}, and temper out 4000:3993, you end up with a 4-<br/>&gt; dimensional temperament which (in one optimized form) can be<br/>&gt; constructed from these four generators, in cents: g1=1200., g2=-<br/>&gt; 165.9852708, g3=2785.912380, g4=3368.915093.</p><p>As Paul mentions below, another interesting temperament which tempers<br/>out 4000/3993 is 311-equal.
