I just listened to Shahin&apos;s samples<br/>with great interest! I have long been a lover of Persian music and I<br/>hear the influence even in those compositions using scales unrelated<br/>to those that are traditional Persian.</p><p>I recognize my old friends Gene Smith and Carl Lumma. Is Paul Erlich<br/>still active here? I have missed you gentlemen! I have been very<br/>busy. I returned to graduate school 37 years after earning my B.A. in<br/>Music Education and just finished a Master of Music in Choral<br/>Conducting at the University of Florida (3.95/4.0 GPA; one B+ in my<br/>first semester) at a young 62 years of age. I&apos;m still in Gainesville<br/>looking to use my newly earned degree professionally.</p><p>I&apos;ve also had substantial first-hand exposure to the untuned (as<br/>opposed to unwashed) masses in academia, including a sadly high<br/>number of professors who dismiss anything approaching precision in<br/>tuning as anal retentive. It&apos;s refreshing to see for myself once<br/>again that those of us who feel precision tuning just might have some<br/>importance in the overall scheme of general musicality have not all<br/>evaporated into some species of tonally amorphous cosmic void.</p><p>Some of you may remember that I founded and directed the Cantus<br/>Angelicus Choral Society, which I had to leave sadly after ten years<br/>in order to come back to school. I was very much into adaptive just<br/>intonation in the a cappella performance of common practice music,<br/>mostly renaissance, baroque and classical, and of course remain<br/>interested in microtonal composition.</p><p>I have since greatly refined my techniques for training choirs to<br/>sing this way, including a strong component of digital sound<br/>production and recording techology. I developed a formal choral<br/>training workshop that I have delivered professionally with<br/>astounding results. No one has been more surprised than I at the<br/>effectiveness of these techniques, which have a solid foundation in<br/>psychoacoustics in the special case of tuning with timbres of high<br/>harmonicity (e.g., the human voice, organ, strings, winds, etc).</p><p>I also tested this training approach statistically with UF music<br/>majors, including one graduate student and one faculty. I got a 99.9%<br/>confidence level with the most conservative statistical method<br/>(Wilcoxon Ranked Difference) after a maximum of four hours exposure<br/>(1/2 hour/week for 8 weeks) to the training. Most of the measurements<br/>were objective. The only one that was subjective has an objective<br/>basis in ranked digital recordings available to interested reviewers<br/>and it ranked roughly the same way as the objective components. The<br/>99.9% confidence level was of the total composite score. All but one<br/>of the component scores showed individual confidence levels of 99.7%<br/>or higher, and the lowest confidence level was 96.3%.</p><p>I would love to hear something of what has transpired in the lives of<br/>those who still may recognize me from that ancient past, the two<br/>years during which I was a very active participant here.</p><p>Most sincerely,</p><p>Robert<br/>Robert P.

Though, I fear<br/>my presence was more an occasion for ruckus than actual microtonal progress!</p><p>Nevertheless, being the dashing amateur that I am, I have come up with an<br/>interesting tuning that I implemented on my personal Qanun some months ago.<br/>If you dig up the posts of the past week, you will encounter the<br/>announcement I made concerning a presentation I delivered on this subject<br/>past Sunday.</p><p>Anyhow, the tuning is identified as 79-tone Moment of Symmetry out of<br/>159-tET by Gene Ward Smith.

I&apos;d been offline<br/>here for a long time when I decided to do this. I had been laid off<br/>and couldn&apos;t find work in my little rural Iowa town of around 9,600<br/>population and tried to find work in music elsewhere to no avail. My<br/>lack of an advanced degree was a big inhibiting factor, so I decided<br/>to do something about it. I could have never gotten a graduate<br/>assistantship on the basis of my undergraduate transcripts either,<br/>which were lously (2.85/4.0 GPA and only 3.1 in my major area). It<br/>was my Cantus Angelicus recordings that did the trick.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; Some of you may remember that I founded and directed the Cantus<br/>&gt; &gt; Angelicus Choral Society,<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Yup -- I&apos;ve got the CD.<br/>&gt;<br/>Great! Hope you enjoy it, Carl.</p><p>&gt; &gt; I also tested this training approach statistically with UF<br/>&gt; &gt; music majors, including one graduate student and one faculty.<br/>&gt; &gt; I got a 99.9% confidence level with the most conservative<br/>&gt; &gt; statistical method (Wilcoxon Ranked Difference) after a maximum<br/>&gt; &gt; of four hours exposure (1/2 hour/week for 8 weeks) to the<br/>&gt; &gt; training.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; In what test?<br/>Pitch discrimination, harmonic tuning judgments, active tuning of<br/>unisons and major thirds with the voice to an electronic keyboard.</p><p>&gt; &gt; Most of the measurements were objective.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; What kind of measurements were they?</p><p>For pitch discrimination we check the ability to discriminate the<br/>direction of change up or down of a microtonal increment using a<br/>binary sequence (45 cents, then 5, 25, 35 or 15 depending on whether<br/>they got it right or not, etc.). This assesses their ability to<br/>discriminate pitch increments by finding where they fall within 5<br/>cent increments from 5 to 45 cents. There were some that stopped at<br/>20 cents! They were instrumental majors. A few could do five right<br/>off the bat, and as you might suspect, these were at the high end in<br/>performance respects as well. Most of these improved to three cents<br/>after the training. All the rest made it down to five.</p><p>The harmonic tuning test used a harmonic timbre and 217-tET to check<br/>the ability to detect a &quot;perfect&quot; tuning (217-tET yields near-perfect<br/>tunings for 5-limit JI) or variations from it in the 5.530-cent<br/>increments intrinsic to this ET. It tested the P5 and M3 by varying<br/>the top pitch. They had to indicate on paper with a circle whether<br/>the pitch was pure, sharp, or flat, and whether it was a purer or<br/>worse tuning than the previous one. The tunings varied from pure by<br/>as much as as six increments or about 1/3 of an ET semitone.</p><p>The answers were weighted according to difficulty (weighted inversely<br/>with the degree of variation from pure or degree of change in tuning<br/>for the purer or worse than the previous tuning). I was amazed to<br/>find out how poorly most of them performed on these tests initially,<br/>but most of them had improved significantly after the training and<br/>some improvements were absolutely dramatic.</p><p>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; I would love to hear something of what has transpired in the<br/>&gt; &gt; lives of those who still may recognize me from that ancient<br/>&gt; &gt; past, the two years during which I was a very active<br/>&gt; &gt; participant here.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I got married and had a kid.  Worked at Keyboard magazine<br/>&gt; for a year.  Tried to keep up with theory developments around<br/>&gt; here, which have been significant.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; -Carl<br/>&gt;<br/>So you got married and had a kid! Hope you still have the kid! :)<br/>Congratulations! I notice things have gotten pretty sophisticated<br/>here. A lot is over my head, as was always the case, especially where<br/>Gene Smith and Paul Erlich&apos;s math was concerned. I can participate<br/>knowledgeably in some areas, though, I believe (hope). I would like<br/>to learn how to manipulate midi files, especially learn about tools<br/>that simplify this beyond direct text edits inside the files. I would<br/>also like to learn how to use C-Sound, I believe it&apos;s called, or<br/>whatever else is recommended these days. I&apos;m interested in getting<br/>more into composing, although choral training with an emphasis on<br/>intonation is still my big thrust professionally.

I just listened to Shahin&apos;s<br/>samples<br/>&gt; &gt; with great interest! I have long been a lover of Persian music<br/>and I<br/>&gt; &gt; hear the influence even in those compositions using scales<br/>unrelated<br/>&gt; &gt; to those that are traditional Persian.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; I recognize my old friends Gene Smith and Carl Lumma. Is Paul<br/>Erlich<br/>&gt; &gt; still active here? I have missed you gentlemen! I have been very<br/>&gt; &gt; busy. I returned to graduate school 37 years after earning my<br/>B.A. in<br/>&gt; &gt; Music Education and just finished a Master of Music in Choral<br/>&gt; &gt; Conducting at the University of Florida (3.95/4.0 GPA; one B+ in<br/>my<br/>&gt; &gt; first semester) at a young 62 years of age. I&apos;m still in<br/>Gainesville<br/>&gt; &gt; looking to use my newly earned degree professionally.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; I&apos;ve also had substantial first-hand exposure to the untuned (as<br/>&gt; &gt; opposed to unwashed) masses in academia, including a sadly high<br/>&gt; &gt; number of professors who dismiss anything approaching precision in<br/>&gt; &gt; tuning as anal retentive. It&apos;s refreshing to see for myself once<br/>&gt; &gt; again that those of us who feel precision tuning just might have<br/>some<br/>&gt; &gt; importance in the overall scheme of general musicality have not<br/>all<br/>&gt; &gt; evaporated into some species of tonally amorphous cosmic void.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; Some of you may remember that I founded and directed the Cantus<br/>&gt; &gt; Angelicus Choral Society, which I had to leave sadly after ten<br/>years<br/>&gt; &gt; in order to come back to school. I was very much into adaptive<br/>just<br/>&gt; &gt; intonation in the a cappella performance of common practice music,<br/>&gt; &gt; mostly renaissance, baroque and classical, and of course remain<br/>&gt; &gt; interested in microtonal composition.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; I have since greatly refined my techniques for training choirs to<br/>&gt; &gt; sing this way, including a strong component of digital sound<br/>&gt; &gt; production and recording techology. I developed a formal choral<br/>&gt; &gt; training workshop that I have delivered professionally with<br/>&gt; &gt; astounding results. No one has been more surprised than I at the<br/>&gt; &gt; effectiveness of these techniques, which have a solid foundation<br/>in<br/>&gt; &gt; psychoacoustics in the special case of tuning with timbres of high<br/>&gt; &gt; harmonicity (e.g., the human voice, organ, strings, winds, etc).<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; I also tested this training approach statistically with UF music<br/>&gt; &gt; majors, including one graduate student and one faculty. I got a<br/>99.9%<br/>&gt; &gt; confidence level with the most conservative statistical method<br/>&gt; &gt; (Wilcoxon Ranked Difference) after a maximum of four hours<br/>exposure<br/>&gt; &gt; (1/2 hour/week for 8 weeks) to the training. Most of the<br/>measurements<br/>&gt; &gt; were objective. The only one that was subjective has an objective<br/>&gt; &gt; basis in ranked digital recordings available to interested<br/>reviewers<br/>&gt; &gt; and it ranked roughly the same way as the objective components.<br/>The<br/>&gt; &gt; 99.9% confidence level was of the total composite score. All but<br/>one<br/>&gt; &gt; of the component scores showed individual confidence levels of<br/>99.7%<br/>&gt; &gt; or higher, and the lowest confidence level was 96.3%.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; I would love to hear something of what has transpired in the<br/>lives of<br/>&gt; &gt; those who still may recognize me from that ancient past, the two<br/>&gt; &gt; years during which I was a very active participant here.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; Most sincerely,<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; Robert<br/>&gt; &gt; Robert P.

Pardon the delay in replying. I just haven&apos;t had time to<br/>return to this list until just now. Thank you for your warm welcom<br/>and I&apos;m pleased to make your acquaintance, too.</p><p>&gt; &gt; Some of you may remember that I founded and directed the Cantus<br/>&gt; &gt; Angelicus Choral Society, which I had to leave sadly after ten<br/>&gt; &gt; years in order to come back to school.

Do you see it<br/>&gt; as a viable practice for new music too?</p><p>Yes, of course, most particularly that which is written<br/>conventionally in the sense that it still essentially subscribes to<br/>the 12-tone paradigm. I can&apos;t help but observe that the top, world-<br/>class string quartets play romantic and post-romantic works conceived<br/>as if in 12-tET (lots of enharmonic modulations, or at least<br/>the use of &quot;enharmonic equivalences&quot; whether modulations or not) in<br/>what is essentially adaptive JI using a kind of tweaked 12-tET as a<br/>basis while tuning just vertical harmonies. It just happens naturally<br/>on instruments that are freely tuned in real time when played by<br/>truly fine musicians.</p><p>Having said that, however, I would hate to see that remain the only<br/>new music created. With folks around like you here on this list, I<br/>heave a sigh of relief over what I believe is a very low risk<br/>of that. I would love to see a much more flexible sense of what<br/>constitutes tonal resources become the norm, though, instead of a<br/>freak sideshow or whatever.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; I have since greatly refined my techniques for training choirs to<br/>&gt; &gt; sing this way, including a strong component of digital sound<br/>&gt; &gt; production and recording techology.

I have the paper I mentioned and would be happy to email<br/>it to you. If there&apos;s enough room, I&apos;ll put it in the Files area. I<br/>just ask that anyone using my ideas recognize their source in the<br/>accepted scholarly manner so that it doesn&apos;t constitute plagiarism.</p><p>Thanks for your interest, Yahya. I have found this approach so<br/>incredibly powerful in terms of awakening professional musicians and<br/>amateurs alike to the true musical value and central importance of<br/>precise intonation that I would not want to leave this world with it<br/>all balled up in some little corner somewhere. I&apos;m constantly amazed<br/>at the short shrift so many professionals give issues of intonation,<br/>especially music educators, most of whom, I would submit, are<br/>completely asleep on this issue. I really want to do everything I can<br/>to help change that!</p><p>Sincerely,</p><p>Robert</p></div>
