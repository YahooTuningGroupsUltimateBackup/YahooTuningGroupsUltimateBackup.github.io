Increasing the<br/>&gt;number of keys greatly increases the complexity that performers have to<br/>&gt;master. A very few split-key instruments were available to players (such as<br/>&gt;Handel) dedicated enough to adapt their technique. Otherwise, I think that<br/>&gt;12-tone-per-octave standardization of keyboards was driven not by<br/>&gt;19th-century mass production (as some have claimed), but by<br/>&gt;14th century player convenience as much as economic compromises.</p><p>When I started playing the tenor viol about 2 years ago, I could not<br/>abide the compromise tunings of F# and Bb on the first<br/>fret. So, I split my first fret, and soon after also the third fret to<br/>get good G# and Ab on the F string.  Of course, each split fret<br/>also produces non-coincident &quot;enharmonic&quot; notes on all six strings.  A<br/>few days ago, I thought to count the number of pitches/octave this<br/>arrangement produces, and was surprised to find that it was at least 16,<br/>and some octaves had 18!   It took only a few weeks to become fluent<br/>playing this fingerboard configuration, with great dividends in triadic<br/>consonance&apos;s (I use 1/5 comma meantone).  Of course, there is no<br/>ambiguity<br/>in the one-to-one mapping of notation to finger position (with the<br/>possible exception of using an augmented 6th instead of a minor 7th when<br/>it is clear that the composer intended a 7:4 tuning).  I<br/>can&apos;t imagine that a keyboard with split black keys would be any more<br/>difficult to learn to play.  Therefore, I cannot accept the<br/>&quot;player convenience&quot; factor as the overriding reason for 12 pitch/octave<br/>keyboards.</p><p>Fred Reinagel</p></div>
