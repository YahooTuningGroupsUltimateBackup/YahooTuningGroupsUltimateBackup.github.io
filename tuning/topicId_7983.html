Rectangular keys<br/>spread the note out more.  Try a 1st-inversion minor triad on Erv&apos;s<br/>keyboard v. something like the Wendy Carlos design.</p><p>&gt;If it&apos;s two-dimensional, it isn&apos;t a line, is it?</p><p>If you view the Bosanquet scheme on a plane, the pitch rises along a<br/>&quot;front&quot;, which is represented by a line.  Depending on the order of the<br/>tuning, you may have to adjust the spacing of the keys a little, but...</p><p>&gt;Staff notation, and variations thereof, always have modal invariance.</p><p>Very important!!!</p><p>&gt;(And those Ztars look *smart*.)</p><p>Harvey played one for me when I was in San Diego.  They have enormous<br/>potential -- you can &quot;fret&quot; a single string in more than one place.  And,<br/>since you&apos;re hitting buttons instead of reaching between frets, many of the<br/>fingering problems associated with higher divisions of the octave may be<br/>avoided.  But I&apos;ll defer to a guitarist on that one.</p><p>&gt;Now we have an argument as to whether or not a wind controller qualifies<br/>&gt;as a keyboard.</p><p>No we don&apos;t -- I won&apos;t argue about that!</p><p>&gt;They look like very useful MIDI input devices, but don&apos;t have enough keys<br/>&gt;for the kind of microtonality we&apos;re talking about</p><p>Eeet!  With 8 keys you&apos;d have 256 notes.  See Genovese&apos;s Binary Flute<br/>article in XH 7+8.  Interestingly, the yamaha link you gave has a page on<br/>their wind controller -- one of the most popular, I understand.  The other<br/>famous one is the Akai Ewi, which I believe got started in the days before<br/>MIDI, but has now been updated.</p><p>&gt;Who&apos;s Norman Henry?</p><p>Try searching the Onelist archives.</p><p>-Carl</p></div>
