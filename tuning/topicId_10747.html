Thus in the early 15th century, it appears<br/>that keyboard tunings featuring Pythagorean schisma thirds for<br/>sonorities involving written sharps led to the transition to meantone<br/>around 1450-1480; and Vicentino&apos;s 31-note meantone tuning could have<br/>led to 7-limit or 11-limit style (he finds the near-11:9 acceptably<br/>&quot;concordant,&quot; although evidently unstable or at least unconclusive<br/>judging from his musical examples).</p><p>However, a tuning is often open to many musical styles, depending upon<br/>one&apos;s tastes or preferences. Thus Prosdocimus espouses a 17-note<br/>Pythagorean tuning while maintaining an often traditional 14th-century<br/>outlook, and Vicentino finds the meantone augmented sixth (~7:4, as it<br/>happens) as decidedly on the dissonant side.</p><p>In short, your musical response to a 24-note Pythagorean tuning is<br/>just as valid and beautiful as mine.</p><p>Maybe one way of putting this is that a &quot;Xeno-Gothic&quot; style based on<br/>13th-14th century Western European music reflects my own medievalist<br/>tastes rather than any inevitable tendency of such a tuning itself.</p><p>Most appreciatively,</p><p>Margo Schulter<br/><a href="mailto:mschulter@value.net">mschulter@value.net</a></p></div>
