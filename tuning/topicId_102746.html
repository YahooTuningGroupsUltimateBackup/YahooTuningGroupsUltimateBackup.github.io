One way to approach them would be to take a temperament where two consonances are equated, like in (say) Godzilla, the 49/48 and 81/80 temperament.  Here the generator is both a 7/6 and an 8/7, and it&apos;s not very good at being either; but suppose we warped the generator chain a bit so that in some places, it would be closer to 7/6 and in others it&apos;d be closer to 8/7.  If we did it right, we could probably squeeze some rather accurate-sounding otonal and utonal tetrads out of it.  Or at least improve on it somewhat.  I mean, we could probably think of a million temperaments that could be improved in circulating versions.  I remember a circulating 12-note temperament I stumbled across many moons ago where all the major 3rds were near-Just 5/4, 9/7, or 14/11, and all the minor 3rds 6/5, 7/6, or 13/11, and yet all the fifths were close enough to perfect that it gave the whole tuning very strong consonance and immense versatility across keys.  Granted, with categorical perception in full swing, it didn&apos;t sound even a little bit xenharmonic to me, but it did sound cooler than 12-TET.  When I think about it, it was basically playing on how 12-TET in the 11-limit could be said to temper out 36/35 and 56/55 (on top of 81/80 and 128/125 or whatever).</p><p>I know George Secor came up with a great 17-tone WT, and there&apos;re probably really awesome 19-, 22-, and heck, maybe even 15- and 16-note WT&apos;s just waiting to be discovered.  Hell, I bet there&apos;s even a great 14-note WT that might open up the 14-note world to a lot of people who find 14-ET too discordant.</p><p>And here&apos;s why I&apos;m suddenly interested in this: much of the divide in this group (and the community at large) centers around disagreements about the relative importance of concordance vs. simplicity.  This keeps me from using Sensi[46] as much as it keeps Gene from using Mavila[7].  But when you think about it, meantone and 12-TET, despite being clearly different in concordance, are interchangeable enough in practice that what works musically in one also works more or less as well in the other (unless you&apos;re exploiting 12-TET&apos;s unique enharmonic equivalences or meantone&apos;s lack thereof).  All the theory developed in the meantone era (and the Pythagorean era before it) didn&apos;t get thrown out when everyone switched to 12-TET.  Some people prefer the sound of meantone, some prefer to work in 12-TET, but there&apos;s enough commonalities that people can speak the same language about both tunings, and share insights, and develop compositional techniques that work across tunings.</p><p>So where I&apos;m at is I think it would be great if we could find a few tunings that on the one hand fit a simple ET and sounds at least alright there, but on the other can be made super-concordant as an unequal temperament or a circulating temperament.  I guess the two darlings of the community are Mavila and Porcupine, and maybe we can add Miracle to the list (which, I&apos;ll note, could plausibly be manifested in 21-ET for those that don&apos;t care about the loss in accuracy).  I&apos;m still waiting for the Semaphore wave to hit, but anyway...anybody up to a circulating Mavila[16] temperament?  Is there *anything* we can do to Mavila to make it more concordant?</p><p>-Igs</p><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, Mike Battaglia &lt;battaglia01@...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I was talking to Chris Vaisvil, and he said that although he finds the<br/>&gt; theory hard to follow sometimes, if we just send him Scala files he&apos;ll<br/>&gt; play in any tuning we want.

I don&apos;t think superpyth really enters into the equation, except perhaps for some &quot;temperament ordinaire&quot; type tunings that have one or more sharp fifths (and not likely even in those cases). Many of those meantone-based tunings have only two distinct sizes of fifths (Werckmeister nearly but not exactly so): tempered and just, but you could distribute the variation more evenly. Similarly, you could imagine versions of augmented, diminished, injera, and pajara as 12-note circulating temperaments. One of my well-temperaments from back when I was experimenting with those things was based on diminished temperament. Basically you&apos;ll start out with one interval per period that&apos;s a different size from your generator, take the difference and distribute it over one or more adjacent generators.</p></div><h3>Chris Vaisvil &#x3C;chrisvaisvil@...&#x3E;</h3><span>1/11/2012 5:45:47 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>I don&apos;t know - I&apos;d have to run the same piece through both tunings to hear<br/>them side by side.</p><p>I think I get immersed when I play and don&apos;t hear what I&apos;m doing compared<br/>to another tuning per se.</p><p>Got this one coming up in a few minutes.</p><p>Chris</p><p>On Wed, Jan 11, 2012 at 8:33 PM, Mike Battaglia &lt;battaglia01@...&gt;wrote:</p><p>&gt; **<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; On Jan 11, 2012, at 8:04 PM, Chris Vaisvil &lt;chrisvaisvil@...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; This seems to be very close to the porcupine 15 I used.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Sounds good.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Chris<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Lol, I love it.
