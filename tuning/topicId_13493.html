In those days it was called flyting and poets would remark on each<br/>other&apos;s ineptitude by publishing critical or rude verses. Here&apos;s an<br/>elegant couplet and one of  my favourites -</p><p>                    &quot;Nane (none) shall venture near thy Gate<br/>                    Which mings (stinks) of Haddock and of Skate&quot;.</p><p>Perhaps we should enter into this fine tradition by writing<br/>JI/Microtonal pieces to illustrate our personal differences, thereby<br/>sublimating our opinions  as well as enhancing the repertoire.</p><p>Peace to All.</p></div>
