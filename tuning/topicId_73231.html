This implies a minor 9th chord<br/>of 28:35:42:50:60, for example.</p><p>Result here:<br/><a href="http://launch.groups.yahoo.com/groups/tuning_files2/files/tomd/">http://launch.groups.yahoo.com/groups/tuning_files2/files/tomd/</a></p><p>...Make sure the volume is high enough!</p><p>Concerning the project of adaptive septimal near-as-damn-it-JI for the<br/>classics (possibly using 171- or 159- EDO steps), there seems to be a<br/>clear rule of how to handle chord progressions.</p><p>It all hinges (as one might guess, being basically a 1/3 comma scheme)<br/>on the minor thirds. Mostly you want them to be 6/5. But in the<br/>dominant 7th and dim7 chords you need 25/21&apos;s, which are about 2/3<br/>comma, or two steps, different.</p><p>To avoid any voice moving more than a single step between chords, if a<br/>6/5 third has to proceed to a 25/21 (with the same nominals), the<br/>upper voice must move down and the lower voice up.</p><p>Archetypal example:</p><p>CCEG -&gt; AC#EG -&gt; ACDF# -&gt; GBDF -&gt; GCCE</p><p>In the first chord change the G moves down a step and the E up a step.<br/>In the second change A moves up a step and A-C should be a 25/21,<br/>which means the C has not shifted at all. In the third change D moves<br/>up one more step, which puts G back a pure fifth above the unchanged C.</p><p>There is an amusing connection with Stanhope&apos;s temperament, which has<br/>C-G pure and 1/3 comma steps at G-D-A-E. The roots of chords in the<br/>progression above (C,A,D,G,C) are at the pitches of the temperament!</p><p>~~~T~~~</p></div><h3>Daniel Thompson &#x3C;microtonaldan@yahoo.com&#x3E;</h3><span>9/16/2007 1:59:44 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>I like these.
