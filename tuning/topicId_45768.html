Alternative<br/>tuning is as philosophically proletarian as one could hope, in its aim to revolutionize<br/>intellectual thought, to stand up for the rights of the disenfranchized outsiders and,<br/>for some, to overthrow the prevailing system. I like to think of 12tet as an aristocracy,<br/>given its close association with the excesses of the Romantic orchestra and the<br/>Wagner et al. generation. Adorno seemed to argue that popular music is like the<br/>capitalist bourgeois, ousting the old aristrocratic art. Challenging contemporary<br/>music, especially in alternative tunings, would seem a clear candidate for proletarian<br/>status, no? (Of course, this begs the question of what I mean by &apos;challenging&apos; and I<br/>would have to agree with Adorno that challenging music is music that is capable of<br/>expressing emotions that do more than simply prop up the status quo: e.g., anger,<br/>alienation, political unrest as well as elements of sublime peace and emotional<br/>sincerity that are sorely lacking in most capitalist art traditions--genre is<br/>unimportant so long as the content is not purely commercial.) -Justin</p></div>
