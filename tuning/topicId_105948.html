I picked instruments based on words that I happen to have in Tirelat and Jarda, which sounds like a haphazard way to put a group together, but it turned out all right. Then I needed a tuning that I haven&apos;t used in Zireen music, so I picked maqamic[17].</p><p><a href="https://sites.google.com/site/teamouse/vini.mp3?attredirects=0">https://sites.google.com/site/teamouse/vini.mp3?attredirects=0</a></p><p>Instruments are from Garritan World Instruments and Garritan Jazz &amp; Big Band: ukulele, jogi baja, alphorn, banjo, acoustic guitar, and handbells. The tuning is centered around C, but the music is mainly in the key of G minor.</p><p>I&apos;m not familiar with a jogi baja, but I picked it because I wanted something that sounded like an oboe that wasn&apos;t an orchestral oboe. Wikipedia doesn&apos;t know what it is. I&apos;d like to find something that doesn&apos;t sound as much like a guitar and a banjo, but so far the regular guitar and banjo seems to work out better than the alternatives.</p><p>I was a little skeptical about how an essentially quartertone scale would work with harmony, but with acoustic instrument samples it seems reasonably good.</p></div>
