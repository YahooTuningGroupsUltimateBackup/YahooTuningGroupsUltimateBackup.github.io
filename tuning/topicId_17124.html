Below are a few of my first impressions:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Ar Tar:  A beautiful &quot;Ambient&quot; piece with gentle beating chordal<br/>&gt; clouds.</p><p>It&apos;s actually a 28 second loop that has 8 (I think) copies<br/>echoing along behind it in stereo. Then after I mixed it<br/>down to stereo, I made another copy and delayed that too.<br/>Turn it up and you can hear faint traces of older material.<br/>17 limit JI - my first new piece of the new millennium!</p><p>&gt; Late Winter Day:  A gorgeous, dreamy &quot;Enoesque&quot; piece (meant as the<br/>&gt; highest possible compliment). Love this!!!</p><p>Microtonality was achieved by recording each track at a different<br/>tape speed. This is a really old track, maybe 6 or 7 years old.<br/>It&apos;s a Roland SH101 that&apos;s been on what seems to be permanent<br/>loan to me. Thanks for the Eno ref - it reminds me of something<br/>off of Apollo.</p><p>These other two pieces just kind of popped up there this afternoon.<br/>Because of the holidays, it took about 14 days for these tracks to get<br/>approved.</p><p>&gt; A Million Ascending Bubbles:  A darker Ambient approach with<br/>&gt; beautiful metal overtone sustaining timbres.  This is a<br/>&gt; wonderful &quot;mood&quot;!</p><p>This could be the SH101, but could also be a Casio. A digital<br/>delay warps the pitches. I remember stumbling onto this sound<br/>and a light bulb went off in my head: get this on tape!</p><p>&gt; Genesis of a Raindrop:  A soft drone piece with long held pitches and<br/>&gt; slow evolution. I love the tension that happens on into the piece<br/>&gt; when more dissonant intervals are interjected.</p><p>Actually a serial 12tet piece inspired by hearing La Monte Young<br/>explain his Trio for Strings on the radio. A very old piece from<br/>my pre-JI days.</p><p>&gt; Folks - here is a guy who&apos;s got it going on!!!</p><p>And thank you for being so generous with you compliments Jacky.</p><p>A more recent 19-limit JI piece for two pianos is coming in<br/>the near future.</p><p>db</p><p>--<br/>* D a v i d         B e a r d s l e y<br/>* 49/32  R a d i o &quot;all microtonal, all the time&quot;<br/>* <a href="http://www.virtulink.com/immp/lookhere.htm">http://www.virtulink.com/immp/lookhere.htm</a></p></div><h3>Lilly S. &#x3C;lilly@zippy.shellyeah.org&#x3E;</h3><span>1/4/2001 1:52:06 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Greetings to everyone here...</p><p>I have just joined this group two days ago, and so far I have been quite<br/>impressed with all the emails and the information and the music that&apos;s<br/>being passed through.</p><p>I have been always fascinated by what I call &quot;geometry of sound&quot;.

This should be a nice job to do in Python and pmask is a<br/>collection of Python objects for algorithmic composition. By the way,<br/>using the pmask.pitch module you have access to a 2000+ scales database<br/>(derived from Scala) so you can easily experiment tunings too.<br/>This is obviously one of the many way you can do your experiments in<br/>this field.</p><p>Maurizio Umberto Puxeddu</p></div><h3>ligonj@northstate.net</h3><span>1/5/2001 7:46:55 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@egroups.com">tuning@egroups.com</a>, David Beardsley &lt;xouoxno@v...&gt; wrote:</p><p>&gt; Thanks for the Eno ref - it reminds me of something<br/>&gt; off of Apollo.</p><p>You know, Eno is another composer who has also mystified me greatly,<br/>in the fact that he has never (at least openly) embraced<br/>microtonality.</p><p>I remember back in the day, he was one of the most respected &quot;big<br/>name&quot; programmers of the DX7 synthesizer. He was there at the dawn of<br/>commercially available microtonally tunable synths, yet he seems to<br/>have remained content with 12tET.</p><p>Still, I love almost all of his music. Recently I broke out one of my<br/>favorite Eno albums (a collaborative effort), called &quot;My Life In The<br/>Bush Of Ghosts&quot;, and this album is just a fresh as the first time I<br/>heard it - a true classic! I literally wore out copies of this from<br/>playing it so much. This was an important release, of formative<br/>influence for me, which still plays into the sound of some of<br/>my &quot;world beat&quot; music today. David Byrne does some cool Arabic<br/>sounding guitar stuff here, but this also had Adrian Belew too.</p><p>I recall reading in an interview with John Hassell, that he felt that<br/>Byrne and Eno, robbed this idea from him, and went on to popularize<br/>this style.</p><p>I also deeply revere John Hassell, as he was also a student of Pran<br/>Nath. As we know, anyone who was, is worth hearing (Don Cherry<br/>anyone?)</p><p>Anybody heard &quot;Fascinoma&quot;; a recent release from Hassell? Has some<br/>lovely takes of &quot;Caravan&quot;. A beautiful acoustic recording!</p><p>&gt;<br/>&gt; A more recent 19-limit JI piece for two pianos is coming in<br/>&gt; the near future.<br/>&gt;</p><p>I&apos;ll be eagerly awaiting this!!!</p><p>Jacky Ligon</p></div>
