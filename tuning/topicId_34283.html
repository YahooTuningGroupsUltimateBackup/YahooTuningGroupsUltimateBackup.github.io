At least, looking at how we&apos;ve notated over the past centuries<br/>- it seems to me that we have used 3-limit notation for 5-limit, and perhaps<br/>even 7-limit (excusing the awful notation of Aug 6ths for the moment).<br/>Perhaps we could continue this idea and use more complex augmented and<br/>diminished pythagorean/5limit intervals for approximations to n-limit ratio<br/>intervals. Take E as a classic example, one moment it could be at 408cent<br/>and the next at 386cent; or D, at 204cent one moment and 182 the next (yet<br/>nobody notates these alterations explicitly in music of the period). Trouble<br/>is, these days, is that we want to write odd chords with notes in strange<br/>places, and not always strictly &apos;consonant&apos; too.</p><p>I&apos;d vote for a few more note-letter names myself... but then think of the<br/>stave size...</p></div><h3><a id=34284 href="#34284">ðŸ”—</a>graham@microtonal.co.uk</h3><span>2/15/2002 9:50:00 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>In-Reply-To: &lt;B892F70D.360E%mark.gould@argonet.co.uk&gt;<br/>Mark Gould wrote:</p><p>&gt; I&apos;d vote for a few more note-letter names myself... but then think of<br/>&gt; the<br/>&gt; stave size...</p><p>I&apos;m using 10 note names, but they&apos;re not letters.
