It was a first rehearsal of the solo violin,<br/>ritornello violin 1 and ritornello violin 2.  The music street now considers<br/>that Bach had in mind only 1 string instrument to a part.

Now,<br/>my alto recorder is scotch taped to a perfect Werckmeister scale.  I could<br/>photocopy it in a photocopier and then someone could tape another alto<br/>recorder to the same modifications.  This means that we could all play a<br/>scale where they would match me: the recorder set a standard pitch.</p><p>Then we played through.  Wow.  Julianne Klopotic said aloud, &quot;this tuning is<br/>so beautiful. I didn&apos;t think it could sound like this.&quot;  Soloist Dan Auerbach<br/>seemed in shock in the train ride back to Manhattan.  &quot;Why don&apos;t people know<br/>about this?  Why isn&apos;t this taught in the conservatories?  Why don&apos;t I go<br/>back to a University to get this out there and myself proper recognition and<br/>degree?&quot;  See, he didn&apos;t know about Columbia University.</p><p>Each person seemed to prefer a different way of thinking of it.  They tried<br/>real hard to hear the semitonal movements.  It through them off.  They<br/>started hearing flatter notes as sharper!  I redirected their ears and mind<br/>so that they could hear the relationship, in G Major of each interval&apos;s<br/>specialness.  Ah, now it was starting to click.  Dan announced, &quot;how many<br/>fiths and how many thirds?&quot;</p><p>Good question, 2 sizes of fifth and 4 sizes of third.  But Julianne was more<br/>interested in the variety of 39 intervals at 6 cents apart.  Maxim was<br/>quieter.  His playing did his talking...really beautiful.  They all picked it<br/>up rapidly (one hour).  There are only 2 more rehearsals.  At the end, there<br/>is a unison between violins which was played exquisitely.  Hope they can do<br/>that on April 30th.  That&apos;s when the music should peak.</p><p>Best, Johnny Reinhard</p></div><h3><a id=35875 href="#35875">ðŸ”—</a>jpehrson2 &#x3C;jpehrson@rcn.com&#x3E;</h3><span>3/25/2002 8:43:38 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In tuning@y..., Afmmjr@a... wrote:</p><p><a href="/tuning/topicId_35872.html#35872">/tuning/topicId_35872.html#35872</a></p><p>&gt;<br/>&gt; Good question, 2 sizes of fifth and 4 sizes of third.
