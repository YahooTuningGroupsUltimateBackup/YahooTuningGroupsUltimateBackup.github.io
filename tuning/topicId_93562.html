It&apos;s chosen so that the missing note from the<br/>13 note Orwell MOS is between E and F, and C major is in<br/>tune to the approximation of 4:5:6.  In addition, C-Bb<br/>approximates 7:4 and C-Db approximates both 16:15 and 15:14.</p><p>The mapping of Orwell generators to keys is:</p><p>0 -4  5  1 -3  2 -2  7  3 -1  8  4  0</p><p>C     D     E  F     G     A     B  C</p><p>(Adopt a fixed width font for optimal satisfaction.)</p><p>It sounds out of tune but with smooth harmony.  It has pure<br/>fifths, but not so many of them.  Regular correspondents may<br/>be concerned at the limitation of 12 notes to the octave.<br/>However, I fully believe that this provides sufficient<br/>material for creative music making.</p><p>The following fifths are in tune as approximations to 3:2:</p><p>Eb-Bb<br/>C-G<br/>Gb-D (sic)<br/>E-B<br/>C#-G#</p><p>C-E-G and Eb-Gb-Bb are (approximate) 4:5:6 triads.<br/>C-Eb-G, E-Gb-B and Gb-A-D are 6:7:9 triads.  E-G-B and<br/>Gb-Bb-D are 10:12:15 triads. C-E-G-Bb-C-F is a 4:5:6:7:8:11<br/>chord and Eb-F-Bb-Db is a 6:7:9:11 chord.  With some of<br/>these chords, the notes are not what you&apos;d expect, as a<br/>result of this being a subset of a 13 note scale instead of<br/>having consistent fingering with 12 notes.</p><p>Here&apos;s a Scala file:</p><p>! orwell12_po.scl<br/>!<br/>12 note Orwell scale, pure octaves<br/>!
