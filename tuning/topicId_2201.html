I don&apos;t know if _my_ use<br/>of wormholes to mean one thing should rule out your using it for something<br/>completely different (i.e., bridges). In fact, maybe we should switch, as<br/>the connections I&apos;m talking about are more like bridges and the things you<br/>call bridges are more like wormholes!</p></div>
