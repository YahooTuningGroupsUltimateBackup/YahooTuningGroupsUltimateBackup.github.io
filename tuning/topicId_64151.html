Practical calculation procedures are described according to the experimental results of dyads in Part I. Theoretical calculation for various kinds of complex tones showed good agreements with psychological experiments. An application to chords of synthesized harmonic complex tones predicted great dependence of consonance characteristics on the harmonic structures, which are not taken in account in the conventional theory of harmony. It became clear that the fifth (2:3) is not always a consonant interval. A chord of two tones that consist of only odd harmonics, for example, shows much worse consonance at the fith (2:3) than at the major sixth (3:5) or some other frequency ratios. This was proved true by psychological expriments carried out in an other institute (Sensory Inspection Committee in the Japan Union of Scientists and Engineers) with a different method of scaling. Thus, the fact warns against making a mistake in appling the conventional theory of harmony to synthetic musical tones that can take variety in the harmonic structure. The theory next explains difference in quality reduction of reproduced sounds through a nonlinear audio instrument by the physical characteristics of input sources, and it provides a measure of evaluating nonlinear distortion.<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;</p><p>Best,<br/>Hudson</p><p>--<br/>  &apos;-------------------------------------------------------------------.<br/>Hudson Lacerda &lt;<a href="http://geocities.yahoo.com.br/hfmlacerda/">http://geocities.yahoo.com.br/hfmlacerda/</a>&gt;<br/>*N&iuml;&iquest;&half;o deixe seu voto sumir! <a href="http://www.votoseguro.org/">http://www.votoseguro.org/</a><br/>*Ap&iuml;&iquest;&half;ie o Manifesto:        <a href="http://www.votoseguro.com/alertaprofessores/">http://www.votoseguro.com/alertaprofessores/</a></p><p>                    == THE WAR IN IRAQ COSTS ==<br/><a href="http://nationalpriorities.org/index.php?option=com_wrapper&Itemid=182">http://nationalpriorities.org/index.php?option=com_wrapper&Itemid=182</a><br/>  .-------------------------------------------------------------------&apos;<br/>--</p><p>&#x9;&#x9;<br/>_______________________________________________________<br/>Yahoo!

One thing practicing/aspiring composers/improvisers should<br/>keep in mind is that it is THEORY - and in fact it has big holes in<br/>it, including issues like chord inversion (anyone like the tonic<br/>as the final chord of a piece in 2nd inversion?), and the related<br/>concept of octave equivalence.</p><p>I however do agree with Keenan and Hudson in thinking of the tritone<br/>along the lines of a 7:5. Personally, I think in &quot;common practice&quot;<br/>musical contexts that our ears bend intervals to their nearest,<br/>simplest JI equivalents - and 7/5 is much simpler than 45/32! Along<br/>similar lines, I think we hear the 7th in the dominant<br/>7th chord (like G7) as 7/4, and in a minor 7th chord like 9/5 (as in<br/>Gm7). And the minor 9th can be understood as the 17th! (I&apos;m not found<br/>of thinking of intervals as &quot;5-limit&quot;, &quot;7-limit&quot;, etc. - omit<br/>multiplications and seek your answers directly<br/>in the harmonic series first!)</p><p>But to more directly address the issue: Lorenzo, you might try<br/>theorizing about the role you&apos;re envisioning for the chord - is it a<br/>substitute for a dominant 7th in a cadence? Or does it perhaps occur<br/>in the midst of a chromatic passage?</p><p>Since it sounds like you have some grasp of music theory, you may<br/>wish to review some common practice concepts like &quot;dominant&quot; &quot;tonic&quot;,<br/>etc., especially in comparison to a range of music including the<br/>classical masters and strong jazz and pop composers, to<br/>learn more about chord usage. And as you study, try out these<br/>yourself, and see where things lead you!</p><p>And remember that music is very &quot;fractal&quot; - concepts like &quot;passing<br/>tone&quot; can be applied to chords and even entire phrases of music.</p><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;lorenzofrizzera&quot;<br/>&lt;lorenzo.frizzera@...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Hi Yahya.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; This leads me to think in terms of distribution.<br/>&gt; Infact if I put five notes at the maximum distance on a chromatic<br/>&gt; circle in 12-et I get a 7b9 chord (or a 9 chord?), while m7/b9 or<br/>&gt; maj7/b9 are less distributed.<br/>&gt; But if this is the reason why, doing the same consideration on<br/>&gt; triads, an augmented triad is worst than a major one?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Lorenzo<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; On Mon, 13 Feb 2006 Keenan Pepper wrote:<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; On 2/13/06, Lorenzo Frizzera ... wrote:<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Hi.<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Sorry if my questions are not specific on tuning but I think<br/>&gt; the answers<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; have something to do with it...<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Why a diatonic chord as Em7/b9 is more dissonant and less<br/>used<br/>&gt; than G7b9<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; which includes a non-diatonic interval as a diminished<br/>&gt; seventh?

Case in point, I would say the best ninth for a m7b5 chord<br/>is<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; a quarter-tone-flat 9th, giving the beautiful chord 5:6:7:9:11.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; Depends on where you place the root, I think.<br/>&gt; &gt; And certainly depends on what the general<br/>&gt; &gt; tuning is.  If it&apos;s JI, and you DO get the<br/>&gt; &gt; exact ratios 5:6:7:9:11, it&apos;s certainly quite<br/>&gt; &gt; harmonious; the timbre will affect which<br/>&gt; &gt; combination tones predominate, though this<br/>&gt; &gt; chord implies difference tones of 1:2:3:4:5:6<br/>&gt; &gt; as well, which gives a full overtone series to<br/>&gt; &gt; 7 and all odd overtones to 11.  If it&apos;s 12-EDO,<br/>&gt; &gt; I find, for a Cm7b5 chord rooted on C4, the<br/>&gt; &gt; major 9th (D6) more harmonious than either<br/>&gt; &gt; the minor 9th (Db6) or the quarter-tone-flat<br/>&gt; &gt; 9th (D-6) - at least for a sampled piano tone.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; However, when I play the same notes an octave<br/>&gt; &gt; lower, the beats make all versions rather ugly<br/>&gt; &gt; and I can&apos;t really pick between them.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; Lorenzo, to try to answer your first question,<br/>&gt; &gt; as to why the Em7b9 sounds less harmonious<br/>&gt; &gt; than the G7b9:  Suppose we sound these<br/>&gt; &gt; chords based on E4 and G4, in the octave above<br/>&gt; &gt; middle C, on the piano, in close position - that is,<br/>&gt; &gt; built in thirds: EGBDF and GBDFAb.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; My guess is that the first partials (octaves) of<br/>&gt; &gt; the root and third (E4 and G4 for Em7b5, or G4<br/>&gt; &gt; and B5 for G7B9) are fairly strong.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; In the case of the Em7b9, these two notes are<br/>&gt; &gt; E5 and G5, and I have a strong sense that they<br/>&gt; &gt; form a cluster of four notes with the D5 and<br/>&gt; &gt; F5 actually played: DEFG.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; However, in the case of the G7b9, these two<br/>&gt; &gt; notes are G5 and B6, and only the G5 forms a<br/>&gt; &gt; cluster, of only three notes, with the F5 and<br/>&gt; &gt; Ab6 actually played: FGAb.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; The second cluster has fewer notes, and thus<br/>&gt; &gt; fewer internal intervals (three instead of six).<br/>&gt; &gt; I think this makes us work harder to sort out<br/>&gt; &gt; the relationships.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; If common practice had not conditioned us to<br/>&gt; &gt; expect discords to resolve stepwise, we would<br/>&gt; &gt; not expect the Ab in the G7b9 to resolve to G;<br/>&gt; &gt; but we do, and that note is already anticipated,<br/>&gt; &gt; by being present as the first partial of the root.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; Should we likewise expect the F of the Em7b9<br/>&gt; &gt; to resolve to the E?  Yes, of course; however,<br/>&gt; &gt; both the root and third are present as first<br/>&gt; &gt; partials on E and G.  We know the F could resolve<br/>&gt; &gt; downwards by step to E, or upwards by step to G;<br/>&gt; &gt; both are harmonious chord tones.  The chord has<br/>&gt; &gt; ambiguous harmonic tendencies.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; On the whole, I think that our common-practice<br/>&gt; &gt; background leads us to find the Em7b9 more<br/>&gt; &gt; confusing and less likely to resolve satisfactorily<br/>&gt; &gt; than the G7b9.  It&apos;s not that it lacks a leading<br/>&gt; &gt; tone; rather that it has one discordant tone that<br/>&gt; &gt; could easily resolve in two different directions.<br/>&gt; &gt; It confounds our expectations.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; I also doubt that the particular tuning (meantone,<br/>&gt; &gt; 12-EDO, some well-tempering or other, or even JI)<br/>&gt; &gt; would make much difference to (my analysis of)<br/>&gt; &gt; this effect.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; Regards,<br/>&gt; &gt; Yahya<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; --<br/>&gt; &gt; No virus found in this outgoing message.<br/>&gt; &gt; Checked by AVG Free Edition.<br/>&gt; &gt; Version: 7.1.375 / Virus Database: 267.15.6/257 - Release Date:<br/>&gt; 10/2/06<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt;</p></div><h3>Kraig Grady &#x3C;kraiggrady@anaphoria.com&#x3E;</h3><span>2/16/2006 1:20:41 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Beethoven Sym no. 7 2nd movement begins and ends on a 6/4 chord,  .But this is influenced by melodic and neighboring movement keys<br/>  From: &quot;harold_fortuin&quot; A few thoughts:</p><p>including issues like chord inversion (anyone like the tonic as the final chord of a piece in 2nd inversion?), and the related concept of octave equivalence</p><p>&gt;&gt;   &gt;&gt;     &gt;<br/>&gt;   -- Kraig Grady<br/>North American Embassy of Anaphoria Island &lt;<a href="http://anaphoria.com/">http://anaphoria.com/</a>&gt;<br/>The Wandering Medicine Show<br/>KXLU &lt;<a href="http://www.kxlu.com/main.html">http://www.kxlu.com/main.html</a>&gt; 88.9 FM Wed 8-9 pm Los Angeles</p></div><h3>harold_fortuin &#x3C;harold_fortuin@yahoo.com&#x3E;</h3><span>2/16/2006 2:38:57 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Kraig,</p><p>I found this online score of Beethoven&apos;s 7th:<br/><a href="http://www.dlib.indiana.edu/variations/scores/akx3424/large/index.html">http://www.dlib.indiana.edu/variations/scores/akx3424/large/index.html</a><br/>and didn&apos;t find this to be the case.</p><p>But I do think I&apos;ve heard some women&apos;s choral arrangement(s) that<br/>ended with a tonic 6-4 chord, but I also recall this sounding<br/>unconvincing to me, at least for common practice harmony.</p><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, Kraig Grady &lt;kraiggrady@...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Beethoven Sym no. 7 2nd movement begins and ends on a 6/4<br/>chord,  .But this is influenced by melodic and neighboring movement<br/>keys<br/>&gt;    From: &quot;harold_fortuin&quot;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; A few thoughts:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;  including issues like chord inversion (anyone like the tonic<br/>&gt; as the final chord of a piece in 2nd inversion?), and the related<br/>&gt; concept of octave equivalence<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; --<br/>&gt; Kraig Grady<br/>&gt; North American Embassy of Anaphoria Island &lt;<a href="http://anaphoria.com/">http://anaphoria.com/</a>&gt;<br/>&gt; The Wandering Medicine Show<br/>&gt; KXLU &lt;<a href="http://www.kxlu.com/main.html">http://www.kxlu.com/main.html</a>&gt; 88.9 FM Wed 8-9 pm Los Angeles<br/>&gt;</p></div><h3>Tom Dent &#x3C;stringph@gmail.com&#x3E;</h3><span>2/17/2006 5:20:30 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Hmmm... yes it does - the horns are in E and sound a minor 6th lower<br/>than their notated pitch, so the 2nd horn&apos;s E is lower than the<br/>bassoon&apos;s A.</p><p>This doesn&apos;t exclude the possibility that a choir arrangement would be<br/>unconvincing.

The theory proposes a dissonance perception<br/>model<br/>&gt; that assumes that the mutual interactions between two components<br/>&gt; constitute an essential additive unit contributing to the<br/>dissonance.<br/>&gt; The model introduces a new concept of &grave;&grave;dissonance intensity&apos;&apos; in a<br/>&gt; certain process of dissonance perception and extends the &grave;&grave;power<br/>law&apos;&apos;to<br/>&gt; the dissonance sensation, which is not clearly related to a certain<br/>&gt; physical value. Practical calculation procedures are described<br/>according<br/>&gt; to the experimental results of dyads in Part I. Theoretical<br/>calculation<br/>&gt; for various kinds of complex tones showed good agreements with<br/>&gt; psychological experiments. An application to chords of synthesized<br/>&gt; harmonic complex tones predicted great dependence of consonance<br/>&gt; characteristics on the harmonic structures, which are not taken in<br/>&gt; account in the conventional theory of harmony. It became clear that<br/>the<br/>&gt; fifth (2:3) is not always a consonant interval. A chord of two<br/>tones<br/>&gt; that consist of only odd harmonics, for example, shows much worse<br/>&gt; consonance at the fith (2:3) than at the major sixth (3:5) or some<br/>other<br/>&gt; frequency ratios.

The m7b9 doesn&apos;t have a &quot;leading tone&quot; so it<br/>&gt;doesn&apos;t really &quot;go&quot; anywhere, whereas cadences with the dominant 7b9<br/>&gt;are almost a clich&iuml;&iquest;&half;.</p><p>&gt;It&apos;s not that it lacks a leading tone; rather that it has one discordant<br/>&gt;tone that<br/>&gt;could easily resolve in two different directions.<br/>&gt;It confounds our expectations. The chord has ambiguous harmonic tendencies.</p><p>I think the concept of &quot;cadence&quot; has to do with the root of each interval<br/>which is based upon the harmonic series. In this sense would be a good idea<br/>to consider Em7/b9 as an inversion of a G13 where the root fight hard<br/>against the bass. But is not so easy to find the root of a chord.</p><p>&gt;One reason is the virtual pitch phenomenon -- G7b9 can be readily<br/>&gt;heard as the 8th, 10th, 12th, 14th, and 17th harmonics of the<br/>&gt;fundamental, which becomes a clear harmonic root in this context,<br/>&gt;while Em7b9 has no simple harmonic-series interpretation and thus<br/>&gt;confuses the virtual pitch mechanism.</p><p>I don&apos;t know really well the virtual pitch mechanism. What chord should be more rooted between m7 (10:12:15:18) and m7/b5 (5:6:7:9)?</p><p>&gt;the minor 9th can be understood as the 17th!

I think that it has to be considered any harmonic series of any<br/>note in a chord which implies the concept of limit as a ramification.</p><p>&gt;However, in the case of the G7b9, these two notes are G5 and B6, and only<br/>&gt;the G5 &gt;forms a cluster, of only three notes, with the F5 and Ab6 actually<br/>&gt;played: FGAb.<br/>&gt;The second cluster (Em7/b9) has fewer notes, and thus fewer internal<br/>&gt;intervals (three &gt;instead of six).</p><p>Correct me if I&apos;m wrong: the dissonance of clusters comes from the<br/>phenomenon of critical bandwidth. CB has a quite logarithmic dimension which<br/>means that any interval minor than a minor third is perceived as dissonant.<br/>If CB (and clusters) would be the only parameter of consonance, an augmented<br/>triad of pure sine wave should be perceived more consonant than a major<br/>triad. I doubt of it.<br/>However the only tetrads without intervals of second is the diminished one<br/>(C Eb Gb Bbb) and this can explain why it were so used and maybe (i don&apos;t<br/>know) before other tetrads as dominant, maj7, m7 or 6 chords. De La Motte<br/>wrote that Bach used it without thinking as a dominant ninth chord without<br/>root. The distribution of the four notes in the octave could be the key of<br/>this usage.<br/>In this way a 7/b9 chord would be &quot;more distributed&quot; than a 9 chord because<br/>it includes more minor thirds intervals and it would be the widest pentad in<br/>12-et.</p><p>&gt;a minor triad is slightly more dissonant than a major triad (in a 7th<br/>&gt;chord).</p><p>I&apos;m not agree.

How about 7th chords with no 3rd?</p><p>&gt; C G D A E B<br/>&gt; with seconds: maj7, m9, maj9, m11<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; C G D A E B F#<br/>&gt; without seconds: diminished triad<br/>&gt; with seconds: 7, m7/b5, any diatonic chord<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Complete circle of fifths<br/>&gt; without seconds: augmented triad, diminished tetrad<br/>&gt; with second: any chromatic chord<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I know it is not so scientifically based... but to my ears it works.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; lorenzo<br/>&gt;</p></div><h3>Lorenzo Frizzera &#x3C;lorenzo.frizzera@cdmrovereto.it&#x3E;</h3><span>3/2/2006 9:00:50 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>&gt; There are at least two distinct concepts of limit (odd and prime),<br/>&gt; but I don&apos;t think your description applies perfectly to either one.<br/>&gt; Both a single harmonic series segment, and a full diamond with enough<br/>&gt; pitches to allow 1/1 to serve as every possible harmonic in this<br/>&gt; segment as part of a full harmonic chord in each case, have the same<br/>&gt; limit, according to both concepts, even though the latter has almost<br/>&gt; the square of the number of pitches of the former.</p><p>Considering the 5-limit we have this basic harmonic series segment: 1 2 3 . 5<br/>This is the trunk of a tree. From each of these numbers begin a branch obtained multiplying each number for the same row: 2 4 6 . 10; 3 6 9 . 15; 5 10 15 . 25;<br/>Repeating the same on each new number gives a big 5-limit tree.<br/>This show the generating way of the limit while its use (ratios) can be similar to a squirrels (musicians) which jumps up and down on the tree.</p><p>Since some numbers stay on different branchs (example 30 is on 15, 10 and 6) maybe the better example would be a bush with a lot of crossed branchs...</p><p>&gt;&gt; We can consider consonant an interval only if greater than a minor<br/>&gt; third (I<br/>&gt;&gt; know it is very arguable). This has to do with the distance and the<br/>&gt;&gt; distribution between notes.
