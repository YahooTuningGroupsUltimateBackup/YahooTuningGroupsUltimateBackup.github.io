So initially it<br/>&gt;began<br/>&gt;&gt; life as a 128 harmonics&apos;-modulating drone/graphics audio-visual<br/>&gt;sequence<br/>&gt;&gt; where one sees the magical transforms one hears.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;Lawrence,<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;Hello! And thanks for the wonderful description of your work here.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;As someone who greatly enjoys using harmonic drones in their music, I<br/>&gt;find this all particularly interesting!<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;I do have a few questions for you though.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt; ORIGINAL EXPERIMENTS:<br/>&gt;&gt; Initially, the question arose- &quot;What happens if I apply Whitney&apos;s<br/>&gt;&gt; differential dynamics to the points in a wave table?&quot;<br/>&gt;&gt; Imagine a sine wave, composed (8 bits- this is 1983!) point 1 moves<br/>&gt;from its<br/>&gt;&gt; initial position, incredibly slowly, when it reaches the maximum<br/>&gt;value, its<br/>&gt;&gt; starts downwards again, and bounces back up again when reaching the<br/>&gt;lowest<br/>&gt;&gt; possible value. It completes a cycle in say 44 minutes. Point 2<br/>&gt;completes 2<br/>&gt;&gt; cycles of movement, and arrives back at the start point in the same<br/>&gt;44mins.<br/>&gt;&gt; Point 3 will do 3 cycles &amp;c &amp;c.........and point 256 will have<br/>&gt;completed 256<br/>&gt;&gt; cycles.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;Let me ask if the movements here are incremental, or is it a smooth<br/>&gt;slow glissandi between points? For instance, when you move from the<br/>&gt;fundamental to the second harmonic, it is a single step?<br/>&gt;I&apos;m imagining that it would seem as a gliss at this slow of movement<br/>&gt;in the higher harmonics.</p><p>IT IS THE AUTOMATIC OUTCOME OF THE HM PROCESS APPLIES TO TIMBRE THAT A<br/>MOVEMENT THROUGH THE OVERTONE SPECTRUM OCCURS BY EACH HARMONIC IN TURN<br/>RISING SLOWLY UP AND THEN DOWN IN VOLUME. AT HIGHER HARMONICS (BETWEEN 64<br/>AND 128) IT SOUNDS SIMILAR TO A GLISSANDO DUE TO THE PROXIMITY OF HARMONICS<br/>UP THERE.</p><p>&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt;   The sine waveform had index numbers assigned to each point (for<br/>&gt;speed<br/>&gt;&gt; assignments) from 0 (!) at the left (say) end, to 255 at the right,<br/>&gt;I found<br/>&gt;&gt; that a sonic journey (through 400,000 timbres) was produced, easily<br/>&gt;&gt; fascinating enough - even on one pitch, which journeyed through<br/>&gt;complex<br/>&gt;&gt; timbral &apos;states&apos; formed from many combinations and amplitudes,<br/>&gt;gradually<br/>&gt;&gt; changing, of 128 harmonics. An &apos;orchestral&apos;, 7-octave sheet of tone-<br/>&gt;anchored<br/>&gt;&gt; from one, low fundamental.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;Ah, I was wondering about this. So the fundamental is present at all<br/>&gt;times, while the harmonics above slowly move to other points?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;Something like the sound of a giant tamboura? Amazing!</p><p>IT&apos;LL BE INTERESTING TO SEE IF IT WAS AS YOU IMAGINED IT (JACKY NOW HAS A<br/>TRIANGLES MANDALA).<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt; I ran this timbre-itself-harmonically-transforming on a low B with<br/>&gt;the 2<br/>&gt;&gt; speakers fractionally detuned to create a mobile phase loop.<br/>&gt;&gt; Its like applying the laws of sound and harmonics of Helmhlotz&apos;s<br/>&gt;&gt; &quot;atmospheric ocean&quot; to the shape itself of the sound waves on that<br/>&gt;ocean.<br/>&gt;&gt; It quickly became known as &quot;the tone&quot;,and &quot;the UFO tone&quot;.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;I&apos;m not sure if I understand this part about the fractionally detuned<br/>&gt;speakers. How did you do this? Couldn&apos;t you achieve this with<br/>&gt;software these days, by changing the phase relationships between the<br/>&gt;left and right channels?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;What was the frequency of the &quot;B&quot; - the fundamental?</p><p>2 AND A BIT OCTAVES BELOW MIDDLE C. THIS WAS DONE BY SOFTWARE ACTUALLY, ONE<br/>SPEAKER WAS DETUNED BY 1/128TH THE FREQUENCY.</p><p>&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt; The sounds resulting are smoothly varying modulations of timbre<br/>&gt;that can be<br/>&gt;&gt; very satisfying or stimulating or both, to listen to. I prefer the<br/>&gt;changes<br/>&gt;&gt; on the slower side.<br/>&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt; TIMBRAL ANALYSIS:<br/>&gt;&gt; A very thin ripple of amplitudes (1 or sometimes 2) harmonics wide<br/>&gt;runs<br/>&gt;&gt; slowly up and then down the harmonic axis (from 1 to 128 and then<br/>&gt;back the<br/>&gt;&gt; same way) forming a difference tone at the fundamental resulting<br/>&gt;from the<br/>&gt;&gt; ascending (ie n+1th) and descending (ie nth) harmonics.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;This is interesting. So was the pitch of B was high enough to allow<br/>&gt;the perception of the difference tone below what would be the<br/>&gt;fundamental pitch?</p><p>ITS A DIFFERENCE TONE BETWEEN HARMONICS, AND  PRODUCED/PRODUCES AN<br/>ARTIFICIAL FUNDAMENTAL AT THE LOW B.</p><p>&gt;<br/>&gt;What I like about this is how you have taken this phenomenon produced<br/>&gt;in the ear and have made it into a functional part of this work. Very<br/>&gt;good!</p><p>THANKS HACKY</p><p>&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt; BOUNCE MK 2 - MODIFIER SHAPES:<br/>&gt;&gt;   A modification of the assignment system of speeds to points was<br/>&gt;then<br/>&gt;&gt; developed. Rather than always having the linear array of points<br/>&gt;moving at<br/>&gt;&gt; speeds proportional to their &quot;index number&quot; , it became desirable<br/>&gt;to assign<br/>&gt;&gt; the speeds in different ways. Such as having the middle points in<br/>&gt;the<br/>&gt;&gt; sequence traveling fastest, and those at each end slowest. Or vice<br/>&gt;versa.<br/>&gt;&gt; This gave rise to the concept of a MODIFIER shape. In the<br/>&gt;elementary system<br/>&gt;&gt; described before, a graphical shape of position in sequence plotted<br/>&gt;against<br/>&gt;&gt; speed was a ramp form (either ascending or descending). If fastest<br/>&gt;(or<br/>&gt;&gt; slowest) speeds are assigned to the middle, this can be called a VEE<br/>&gt;&gt; (because of its shape) or TRIANGLE modifier.<br/>&gt;&gt; In another variant, fastest (or slowest) speeds are assigned to the<br/>&gt;1/4 and<br/>&gt;&gt; 3/4 positions along the sequence of movable points.<br/>&gt;&gt;   The most successful sound/visual combination (on the video/Sound<br/>&gt;mandala<br/>&gt;&gt; piece called<br/>&gt;&gt; &apos;Triangles&apos;) was a triangle wave starting point (this now referred<br/>&gt;to as the<br/>&gt;&gt; SEED form, with &apos;two triangles&apos; as a modifier. (Two &apos;mountains&apos;<br/>&gt;with maximum<br/>&gt;&gt; speed at 1/4 and 3/4 points. The two halves of the image were set<br/>&gt;to move in<br/>&gt;&gt; different directions at the start. Many interesting forms arise,<br/>&gt;which<br/>&gt;&gt; suggest Inca designs. The timbral and graphic sequences are each<br/>&gt;&gt; characteristic of a particular quality, right through the whole<br/>&gt;cycle.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;It sounds very visually interesting as well as sonically.  This would<br/>&gt;make for an interesting union of visual and audio. Have you attempted<br/>&gt;to create a video of this?</p><p>MORE THAN ATTEMPTED. I&apos;VE HAD FOLK IN MY FLAT UNTIL 5AM GLUED TO THE APPLE<br/>II COMPUTER SCREEN AS WELL.<br/>THERE IS MUCH WORK TO DO TO GET IT ALL ONTO DISTRIBUTABLE MEDIA. IN THE<br/>MEANTIME I&apos;M TRYINGTO PUSH FORWARD WITH FURTHER DEVELOPMENTS.</p><p>&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt; TIMBRAL ANALYSIS:<br/>&gt;&gt; These sound sequences (or tones as they have been called) create on<br/>&gt;the<br/>&gt;&gt; palette of 128 (or more of course) harmonics constellations or<br/>&gt;virtual<br/>&gt;&gt; harmonics, gathering, scattering and reforming eg a ripple of<br/>&gt;amplitude<br/>&gt;&gt; running up and then down the axis of harmonic numbers.<br/>&gt;&gt; If I start with a sine wave and modify it with two humps (like the<br/>&gt;modulus<br/>&gt;&gt; of a sine wave- values without a minus sign), and starting by<br/>&gt;moving the<br/>&gt;&gt; left half up and the right down I get a strange bundle (looking at<br/>&gt;a dynamic<br/>&gt;&gt; FFT) of harmonics 4 or so harmonics wide, travelling up and down.<br/>&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt; EDIT or PREDESIGN?:<br/>&gt;&gt; We (my then students Michael Tusch, James Larsson and other friends<br/>&gt;in the<br/>&gt;&gt; 80s, and now Dave Snowdon in the 90s and 00s) decided we like/d to<br/>&gt;listen to<br/>&gt;&gt; an unedited algorithm, rather than edit fragments a la Shakespeare<br/>&gt;with<br/>&gt;&gt; portions, we have gone for designing the action into the spec. (in<br/>&gt;the<br/>&gt;&gt; envisioning of the characteristics and the ramifications) rather<br/>&gt;than<br/>&gt;&gt; cutting up bits. This I feel is an interesting paradigm approach<br/>&gt;for all<br/>&gt;&gt; kinds of computer-generated art. More organic? What do you think?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;So basically you programmed all of the possibilities, to where one<br/>&gt;didn&apos;t have the ability to edit it?</p><p>YES, ALL THE HOURS OF CREATIVITY GO INTO DESIGNING DESIRABLE FEATURES INTO<br/>THE RESULTING SOUNDS, MUSICS, VISUALS AND AUDIO-VISUALS.
