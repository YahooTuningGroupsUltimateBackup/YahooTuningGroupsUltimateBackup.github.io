And<br/>from a lack of gentle introductions, as Paul Erlich has been wont<br/>to call them, many misunderstandings can follow otherwise<br/>avoidable.</p><p>In seeking to address some of these basic questions, tentatively,<br/>as a nonnative &quot;student&quot; of some of these styles at an early<br/>state of learning, I seek to provide one starting point for<br/>addressing some of the issues you raise.</p><p>The 17 steps or perdeler -- perde-s as I might write in English<br/>to show that this is a plural of Turkish &quot;perde&quot; (Persian pardah)<br/>meaning &quot;pitch,&quot; &quot;step,&quot; or also &quot;fret -- are one avenue for<br/>exploring some points which seem to me central to some of the<br/>discussions on the list.</p><p>Different Near Eastern schools of theory diverge both as to the<br/>number of these cardinal steps -- each of which may be subject to<br/>many fine shadings -- and the general scheme for their placement.<br/>Thus Arab theorists and modern systems of notation often use a<br/>model of 24 positions per octave -- not necessarily equal in<br/>spacing!</p><p>Turkish and Syrian musicians often use a system of 53 commas,<br/>while Amine Beyhom suggests that if a simpler categorization is<br/>desired, 17 steps rather than 24 may be preferable. He used the<br/>24-not-necessarily-equal scheme for his thesis, but later<br/>expressed a preference for 17 steps as a simplified reference.</p><p>--------------------------------------<br/>1. A 17-step concept, variously shaded<br/>--------------------------------------</p><p>Here I&apos;ll focus on two of the possible versions for a 17-note set<br/>of steps actually found in a 24-note temperament I use, the O3<br/>system. As we&apos;ll see, in a &quot;17-perde&quot; concept, while some of the<br/>steps like 4/3 and 3/2 tend to be stable across a range of<br/>implementations, the location and color of other steps is highly<br/>negotiable. My purpose is not only to present a list of names,<br/>but some musical explanations. While I can hardly escape from my<br/>own foibles and idiosyncrasies, I will try to make some of them<br/>clear.</p><p>It should be understood that circulation is not a given for Near<br/>Eastern systems, even though some like a 53-note Pythagorean<br/>tuning or 53-EDO do meet this criterion, not to speak of many<br/>unequal temperaments which could be applied. Thus a typical<br/>17-note Persian tar tuning exemplifies the 17 steps, although in<br/>a slightly different way than the models I&apos;ll be presenting, but<br/>is generally quite noncirculation. George Secor&apos;s 17-WT _could_<br/>be used for a tar fretting, I&apos;d guess, and might yield pleasant<br/>results; but it is not how Iranian musicians generally tune, any<br/>more than traditional gamelan ensembles generally follow the JI<br/>ratios of Lou Harrison or Jacques Dudon (as beautiful as they<br/>are, also).</p><p>As it happens, my own concept of the 17 steps is a &quot;thirdtone&quot;<br/>concept: that is, each perde or step will generally represent<br/>some category of major, minor, or Zalzalian (also neutral or<br/>middle) interval spaced at some kind of &quot;thirdtone&quot; from an<br/>adjacent basic perde, say an interval of around 55-85 cents.<br/>There can also be two or more versions of the same basic perde,<br/>say a usual major second or tone around 9/8, or a septimal tone at<br/>around 8/7, with such comma distinctions common, and indeed both<br/>desirable and inevitable, in a 24-note system such as mine.</p><p>Fine variations are especially typical for Zalzalian intervals.<br/>In my 24-note system, for example, there are neutral thirds at<br/>334.0/335.2, 345.7/346,9, 357.4/358.6, and 369.1/370.3 cents,<br/>with sizes for each type varying by 1/1024 octave at different<br/>locations.</p><p>In an Arab context, taking the step called rast as the 1/1 of the<br/>gamut (shown by the note C in modern staff notation), I would<br/>consider the 357-359 cent variety as the standard distance<br/>between the perde-s or steps rast and sikah, the latter the<br/>neutral third above rast.</p><p>In a Turkish context, while this placement might be acceptable, I<br/>would consider the largest neutral third at 369-370 cents as more<br/>distinctly characteristic, giving this third a submajor quality,<br/>melodic as well as vertical in polyphonic contexts, which has a<br/>distinctly &quot;Ottoman&quot; air.</p><p>Either choice will affect the placement of other perde-s, and may<br/>sometimes call for the use of a step altered by a comma from its<br/>&quot;standard&quot; position, as well shall see. As Ozan might observe,<br/>the mandatory use of such a nonstandard position (e.g. 12/7<br/>rather than 22/13 for a major sixth in a given maqam if one<br/>wishes to have a major sixth at all) is much more apt to happen<br/>in a 24-note system with a large number of neutral shadings than<br/>in a 79-note system such as that for his qanun with yet more<br/>shadings but far more steps!</p><p>----------------------------------------------<br/>2. A set of perde-s for Maqam Rast, Arab style<br/>----------------------------------------------</p><p>To get a feel for a set of 17 perde-s that comes out fairly<br/>&quot;standard,&quot; at least in terms of my standard, let&apos;s consider an<br/>Arab flavor of Maqam Rast that might not be too far from the norm<br/>in Egypt or Lebanon, and possibly somewhere between these local<br/>practices, I&apos;d guess, but with some quirks.</p><p>As is often the case, the name of a step will correspond to that<br/>of a maqam where it is either the final or resting note, or else<br/>another prominent note in the course of the sayr or &quot;path&quot; of<br/>melodic development. Thus perde rast, the main reference point<br/>for Arab and Turkish gamuts, is the final of Maqam Rast; while<br/>perde huseyni, at a major sixth higher, plays a very prominent<br/>role as the fifth of Maqam Huseyni, often appearing more<br/>prominently than the final dugah (a major second above rast).</p><p>Note that I&apos;m capitalizing the names of maqamat (and tetrachords<br/>or other genera, which often share the names of maqamat), but<br/>giving the perde names in lower case: thus &quot;huseyni is the fifth<br/>degree of Maqam Huseyni.&quot;</p><p>Arbitrarily, let&apos;s select G on my upper12-note keyboard, here<br/>shown as G*, as the location of perde rast, thus corresponding to<br/>a standard Arab notation of C. Our table of 17 perde-s will be as<br/>follows, with the choice of steps meant to favor an accent on the<br/>routine where possible, for example regular diatonic major and<br/>minor steps. I use the Turkish names, with the Arabic names often<br/>identical or very similar, but sometimes different. Thus the step<br/>called beyati in the Turkish terminology, at a minor sixth above<br/>rast, is called shuri in a common Arab usage.</p><p>  Perde    Category    Cents from rast  Arab/keyboard  Step size</p><p>   rast     unison           0.0          C  /  G*<br/>                                                         70.3<br/>  shuri      min2           70.3          Db    G#<br/>                                                         80.9<br/> zengule     Zal2          151.2          Dd    A<br/>                                                         57.4<br/>  dugah      Maj2          208.6          D     A*<br/>                                                         80.9<br/>  kurdi      min3          289.5          Eb    Bb*<br/>                                                         69.1<br/>  segah      Zal3          358.6          Ed    B<br/>                                                         57.4<br/> buselik     Maj3          416.0          E     B*<br/>                                                         80.9<br/> chargah     Perf4         496.9          F     C*<br/>                                                         69.1<br/>  hijaz    small &quot;TT&quot;      566.0          F+    C#<br/>                                                         80.9<br/>  sabah    large &quot;TT&quot;      646.9          Gd    D<br/>                                                         57.4<br/>   neva      Perf5         704.3          G     D*<br/>                                                         80.9<br/>  beyati     min6          785.2          Ab    Eb*<br/>                                                         69.1<br/>   hisar     Zal6          854.3          Ad    E<br/>                                                         57.4<br/>  huseyni    Maj6          911.7          A     E*<br/>                                                         80.9<br/>   ajem      min7          992.6          Bb    F*<br/>                                                         69.1<br/>   evdj      Zal7         1061.7          Bd    F#<br/>                                                         57.4<br/>   mahur     Maj7         1119.1          B     F#*<br/>                                                         80.9<br/> gerdaniye   Perf8        1200.0          C     G*</p><p>My purpose here is to give a quick overview, not to explore all<br/>the ramifications, like the comma shifts required for a number of<br/>these steps as one seeks to tune different maqamat in an<br/>appropriate fashion. While many of the perde-s map conveniently to major,<br/>minor, or neutral categories, the steps at some kind of &quot;tritone&quot; above<br/>Rast are not so easily describable. They may be similar to a regular<br/>diminished fifth or augmented fourth in a given tuning system, or distinct,<br/>as with a lower hijaz at around 11/8 or a high sabah around 16/11.<br/>Further, the flavor of a step such as sabah, with the higher position of<br/>646.9 cents (keyboard D) shown in the table, but 623.4 cents (C#*) equally<br/>vital, may vary not only from maqam to maqam, but within a performance in a<br/>given maqam.</p><p>Let us focus on Maqam Rast itself for the moment. Here there is<br/>what I term a &quot;basic&quot; set of nine steps, including the lower Rast<br/>tetrachord of rast-dugah-segah-chargah, plus the combined notes<br/>of upper Rast tetrachords in conjunct or disjunct positions:</p><p>                                      207.4   150.0   138.3<br/>                                  704.3   911.7   1061.7  1200.0<br/>                                   neva   huseyni  evdj  gerdaniye<br/>       208.6   150.0  138.3<br/>    0.0    208.6  358.6   496.9<br/>    rast   dugah  segah  chargah</p><p>                              207.4  150.0  138.3<br/>                          496.9   704.3  854.3  992.6<br/>                         chargah   neva  hisar   ajem</p><p>To many Arab and Turkish musicians, although not all, one<br/>defining characteristic of a usual Rast tetrachord is that the<br/>larger neutral second precedes the smaller, here 150.0-138.3<br/>cents. Yes, these specific step sizes happen to approximate<br/>superparticular ratios, but the general point is that the first<br/>is somewhat larger than the second. Here the difference is rather<br/>subtle, not quite 12 cents, but enough to mean for me and many<br/>Near Eastern musicians that reversing the order to 138.3-150.3<br/>cents, and retaining the initial tone of the tetrachord, would<br/>properly define a related but different maqam sometimes called in<br/>Arab theory Rast Jadid or &quot;New Rast,&quot; and which I call Mustaqim<br/>because of its resemblance to a mode of that name described by<br/>Ibn Sina in the early 11th century.</p><p>Using these nine steps, we can obtain three common variations on<br/>Maqam Rast involving different flavors of the sixth degree<br/>(neutral or major) and seventh degree (minor or neutral):</p><p>  Disjunct Rast</p><p>                Rast                          Rast<br/>     |----------------------|  tone  |---------------------|<br/>       208.6   150.0  138.3    207.4   207.4  150.0  138.3<br/>    0.0    208.6  358.6   496.9    704.3   911.7 1061.7  1200<br/>    rast   dugah  segah  chargah    neva  huseyni evdj  gerdaniye<br/>     G*     A*     B       C*        D*     E*     F#     G*</p><p> Conjunct (Nairuz) Rast</p><p>                Rast                 Rast<br/>     |----------------------|-------------------| tone |<br/>       208.6   150.0  138.3   207.4  150.0 138.3  207.4<br/>    0.0    208.6  358.6   496.9   704.3  854.3 992.6  1200<br/>    rast   dugah  segah  chargah  neva   hisar ajem  gerdaniye<br/>     G*     A*     B       C*      D*      E    F*     G*</p><p> Suzdular (Ajemli Rast)</p><p>                Rast                        Buselik<br/>     |----------------------|  tone  |---------------------|<br/>       208.6   150.0  138.3    207.4   207.4   80.9  138.3<br/>    0.0    208.6  358.6   496.9    704.3   911.7  992.6   1200<br/>    rast   dugah  segah  chargah    neva  huseyni ajem  gerdaniye<br/>     G*     A*     B       C*        D*      E*    F*      G*</p><p>Disjunct Rast is the standard modern Arab or Turkish form, and<br/>Conjunct or Nairuz Rast the standard medieval form as given by<br/>al-Farabi (not yet under the name of &quot;Rast&quot;). These forms have<br/>tones, larger neutral seconds, and smaller neutral seconds as<br/>their only adjacent steps.</p><p>The third form known as Suzdular to some Arab theorists, and<br/>&quot;Ajemli Rast&quot; in Turkish theory because of its use of the minor<br/>seventh step ajem (a term which could also apply to the conjunct<br/>form), has a semitone step between the major sixth degree huseyni<br/>and the minor seventh degree ajem. The upper tetrachord with<br/>tone-semitone-tone is known in Turkish theory as Buselik, and in<br/>Arab theory often as Nahawand (which in Turkish terms tends to<br/>suggest a different shade of intonation with a larger minor, or<br/>possibly supraminor, third).</p><p>In practice, It is very common to use the neutral seventh step<br/>evdj (Arabic awj) in ascending and the minor seventh step ajem<br/>(Arabic &grave;ajam) in descending, while maintaining the major sixth<br/>degree huseyni; and the conjunct form with the neutral sixth<br/>degree hisar is also common.</p><p>Note that in all these forms, the shared element of the lower or<br/>&quot;root&quot; Rast tetrachord, with the steps rast-dugah-segah-chargah<br/>(Arabic rast-dukah-sikah-jahargah), from the Persian &quot;rast&quot;<br/>meaning &quot;right, correct, standard&quot; plus the words for the<br/>&quot;second,&quot; &quot;third,&quot; and &quot;fourth&quot; steps. These counting names<br/>underscore both the centrality of the step rast itself, and the<br/>form of the Rast tetrachord as having pride of place in defining<br/>the most &quot;fundamental&quot; steps of the gamut.</p><p>For a performer of maqam music, the term &quot;Maqam Rast&quot; embraces<br/>not only the above variations on the maqam proper, but also the<br/>set of common modulations. Let&apos;s quickly look at one of these, a<br/>shift from Maqam Rast on perde rast to Maqam Sikah located, not<br/>so surprisingly, on perde sikah (the same name as Persian or<br/>Turkish Segah, but a different mode than the Persian dastgah or<br/>Turkish maqam bearing this name and founded on this same<br/>degree).</p><p>Maqam Sikah</p><p>            Sikah              Rast                 Rast<br/>     |---------------|------------------------|---------------|<br/>       138.3   207.4   207.4    150.0   138.3   208.6    150.0<br/>    0.0    138.3   345.7   553.1    703.1   841.4   1050.0   1200.0<br/>   segah  chargah  neva   huseyni   ajem  gerdaniye muhayyer tiz_segah<br/>     B      C*      D*      E*       F#      G*       A*       B</p><p>Note that while Maqam Rast has larger neutral intervals above its<br/>final, for example the third rast-segah at 358.6 cents, the sixth<br/>rast-hisar at 854.3 cents, and the seventh rast-evdj at 1061.7<br/>cents, here smaller neutral intervals prevail in terms of the<br/>final. Thus in the lower Sikah trichord we have a Zalzalian second<br/>at 138.3 cents and a third at 345.7 cents; elsewhere we have a<br/>sixth segah-gerdaniye at 841.4 cents and a seventh segah-muhayyer<br/>at 1050.0 cents. A widely shared although not universal<br/>understanding is that the neutral intervals above the final of<br/>Rast are larger than those above the final of Sikah.</p><p>At the same time, there is a subtle contrast, because the middle<br/>tetrachord of Maqam Sikah is none other than a usual Rast with<br/>its prominent larger neutral third to compare with the smaller<br/>size in the SIkah trichord. Here, as it happens, the difference<br/>is not quite 13 cents, or a bit more than half a comma (compare<br/>segah-neva with neva-ajem). The upper trichord, also described as<br/>Rast, is typically completed by a step of 138.3 cents arriving at<br/>the step tiz chargah at an octave above chargah. In effect, we<br/>thus have an upper tetrachord (gerdaniye-tiz chargah) like the<br/>root tetrachord of Maqam Rast transposed up an octave.</p><p>We might say generally that the narrower neutral intervals are in<br/>the &quot;lower central&quot; range, and the wider ones in the &quot;higher<br/>central&quot; range. The &quot;central range&quot; might be around 135-160 cents<br/>for neutral seconds and 342-360 cents for neutral thirds.

This difference of a full 35 cents might<br/>be described as that between submajor and supraminor. In all<br/>versions, the large neutral thirds at 369.1 or 370.3 cents have a<br/>submajor quality also, both in a purely melodic context or in<br/>vertical situations where they very nicely expand to fifths with<br/>a musical effect analogous to that of a similar progression with<br/>a regular major third at 414.8 or 416.0 cents. Both flavors of<br/>thirds, submajor or regular major, are rather complex, and so<br/>make expansion to a fifth by stepwise expansion in contrary<br/>motion a very effective resolution. While a 357-359 cent third<br/>can also be used nicely in such progressions, the central neutral<br/>flavor is rather different than submajor/major.</p><p>In the forms with septimal whole-tones, we have tetrachords with<br/>a large tone near 8:7 plus two small neutral seconds at 138.3 and<br/>126.6 cents. While the contrast between the latter two steps is<br/>muted by comparison to 161.7/126.6 cents in the conjunct form,<br/>there is still the subtle distinction that 138.3 cents is a<br/>&quot;small central neutral second,&quot; while 126.6 is more of a<br/>&quot;supraminor second&quot; or &quot;quasi-semitone.&quot;</p><p>In practice, one might use either form of the major second step<br/>(dugah or sarp dugah) depending on the context in any of these<br/>Rast variations, for example using the near-8/7 step in ascending<br/>toward a near-12/7 major sixth, but the 9/8 step when descending<br/>or more generally when focusing on the lower tetrachord.</p><p>To appreciate how the territory of neutral intervals in this<br/>Turkish style of tuning for Rast differs from that of the Arab<br/>style also sometimes used in Turkey, let us consider the Turkish<br/>counterpart of the Arab Maqam Sikah, which likewise is built on<br/>the third step of Maqam Rast, perde segah. While the structure of<br/>Maqam Segah differs somewhat from the Arab Sikah, both maqamat<br/>have perde segah (Arabic sikah) as their final, and have<br/>trichords or tetrachords above this final highlighting the steps<br/>segah-chargah-neva (Arabic sikah-jaharkah-nawa).</p><p>An interesting feature of Maqam Segah is that it has distinct<br/>ascending and descending forms. It is common for maqamat to have<br/>certain steps often inflected differently differently depending<br/>on the direction or focus of motion, for example the seventh step<br/>of Rast frequently taken as the neutral seventh evdj when rising<br/>toward the octave, and as the minor seventh ajem in descending.<br/>In Segah, however, the contrast is more dramatic, bringing into<br/>play in descent a strikingly disjunct tetrachordal structure:</p><p>  Maqam Segah ascending:</p><p>            Segah                             Hijaz<br/>     |---------------------|  tone  |------------------------|<br/>       126.6  207.4  161.7    207.4  126.6    289.5   80.9<br/>    0.0   126.6  334.0   495.7   703.1   829.7   1119.1   1200.0<br/>   segah chargah  neva   hisar    evdj gerdaniye sunbule tiz_segah<br/>    Bb*     B*     C#*    Eb*      F*      F#*      A*      Bb*</p><p>   Maqam Segah descending:</p><p>                Segah                        Mahur<br/>     |---------------------| apot |-------------------------| limma |<br/>       126.6  207.4  161.7   126.6   207.4   208.6     80.9    80.9<br/>    0.0   126.6  334.0   495.7   622.3   829.7   1038.3   1119.1  1200.0<br/>   segah chargah  neva   hisar    ajem gerdaniye muhayyer sunbule tiz_segah<br/>    Bb*     B*     C#*     Eb*     E*     F#*     G#*       A*      Bb*</p><p>In contrast to the large neutral or submajor third of our Turkish Rast at<br/>369.1 or 370.3 cents, Maqam Segah features a small neutral or supraminor<br/>third above the final at 334.0 cents (segah-neva). The lower tetrachord<br/>also has a supraminor second (segah-chargah) above the final, followed by a<br/>regular tone (chargah-neva) and then a large neutral or submajor second<br/>from the small neutral third step to the fourth (neva-hisar).</p><p>In the ascending form, this lower Segah tetrachord is followed by a tone<br/>and then an upper Hijaz tetrachord, a genus often having a lower neutral<br/>second (here the same 126.6-cent size as in the lower tetrachord), some<br/>kind of minor third, and then a semitone to complete the octave. The step<br/>sizes in this realization are 126.6-289.5-80.9 cents.</p><p>The descending form of Segah, as analyzed by Ozan Yarman in his thesis and<br/>elsewhere, presents a striking instance of disjunct tetrachords with<br/>intervening intervals other than tones. From tiz segah, the octave of the<br/>final, we first descend a regular limma or diatonic semitone to the step<br/>sunbule, an octave plus a minor third above perde rast, and an octave above<br/>rast&apos;s minor third step called kurdi. This is the one step in the basic<br/>seyir, i.e. the &quot;path&quot; or melodic development of Maqam Segah (Arabic sayr),<br/>not found in our three variations on Maqam Rast shown above.</p><p>From this sunbule step, we proceed to explore a tetrachord of which it is<br/>the fourth: Mahur (often known in Arab theory as &grave;Ajam) with the intervals<br/>in ascending order of tone, tone, and semitone, here a regular<br/>207.4-208.6-80.9 cents (ajem-gerdaniye-muhayyer-sunbule). We then encounter<br/>another interesting interval serving to connect two disjunct tetrachords:<br/>from the lowest step ajem of the Mahur tetrachord, we descend by an apotome<br/>of 126.6 cents to hisar, the upper note of the root Segah tetrachord.</p><p>Thus while our more typically Arab shading of Maqam Rast and its companion<br/>Maqam Sikah reflected a rather subtle contrast between intervals in the<br/>higher and lower regions of the central neutral range, our Turkish<br/>Rast/Segah pair shows a much more dramatic contrast of submajor/supraminor.<br/>In a polyphonic setting, just as a submajor third at 369-370 cents will<br/>expand to a fifth by stepwise contrary motion much like a major third, so a<br/>supraminor third at 334 cents (or sometimes 335 cents in this tuning) can<br/>contract to a unison much like a regular minor third at 288.3 or 289.5<br/>cents.</p><p>The basic contrast, however, is itself a primary melodic phenomenon quite<br/>apart from the possible modern element of polyphony. While a Turkish Rast<br/>tetrachord in this tuning features a supraminor second of 126.6 cents<br/>ascending from the submajor third to the fourth (e.g. segah-chargah), the<br/>corresponding Segah tetrachord has a descending supraminor second to the<br/>final (e.g. chargah-segah). In either maqam, the &quot;quasi-semitonal&quot; nature<br/>of this step makes it distinct from a neutral second in the central range,<br/>and yet more so from the large neutral or submajor second of Rast (in its<br/>usual form with a tone around 9:8) and Segah at 161.7 cents.</p><p>In a Turkish context, the significant of this not inappreciable contrast is<br/>heightened when we consider that Rast and Segah alike are often performed<br/>in an interpretation approaching 5-limit major and minor intervals<br/>(e.g. rast-segah near 5:4 and segah-neva near 6:5), of which the submajor<br/>and supraminor shadings favored here may be seen as kindred variations.</p><p>Ozan Yarman has suggested that the rast-segah third may vary from around<br/>27/22 (355 cents) to 5/4 (386 cents), with the sizes here of 369-370 cents<br/>around the middle of this range. Whatever the fine points of flexible pitch<br/>performance as measured in recent studies, they are clearly distinct from a<br/>24-EDO model, since the favored range is distinctly higher than 350 cents.</p><p>---------------------------------<br/>3. Some conclusions and questions<br/>---------------------------------</p><p>As these examples show, maqam music can feature either subtle or dramatic<br/>contrasts between sizes of neutral intervals.</p><p>A submajor/supraminor contrast on the order of 35 cents, as in our examples<br/>of one flavor of Turkish tuning (with some of the fine details reflecting<br/>my temperament rather than any traditional Near Eastern system), is aurally<br/>obvious and quite distinct from a model such as 24-EDO or 17-EDO where<br/>all neutral seconds and thirds have identical sizes. For those seeking<br/>models among smaller EDO tunings, 29-EDO or 36-EDO would be much more to<br/>the point.</p><p>A not quite so dramatic but still clearly significant distinction occurs<br/>when tunings of neutral intervals closely approximate the 53-comma model<br/>favored in Turkey and Syria, and sometimes borrowed by Arab theorists from<br/>other regions who wish to describe the fine points of intonation in the<br/>course of a maqam performance. For example, musicians following something<br/>like this model might play a small neutral second at around 6 commas or 136<br/>cents, and a large neutral second at 7 commas or 158 cents; and tune<br/>neutral thirds at around 15 commas or 340 cents and 16 commas or 362<br/>cents. These differences should be discernible and appreciable.</p><p>A more complex situation occurs in evaluating flexible pitch performances<br/>where intervals usually remain in the central neutral range. Are we merely<br/>hearing small variations around an essentially equal division of the fifth<br/>into two neutral thirds, or of the minor third into two equal Zalzalian<br/>seconds -- whether approximating 24-EDO, 17-EDO, or some other model? Or is<br/>there some purposeful distinction, however subtle it may seem, especially<br/>to the uninitiated or only partially initiated?</p><p>One much look at each case in context. For example, the Iranian master<br/>Dariush Tala&grave;i favors a tuning of a Shur tetrachord at 140-140-220 cents, a<br/>division of a 280-cent minor third into two equal neutral seconds not too<br/>far from 17-EDO (141-141-212 cents). This tuning resembles that reported by<br/>Nelly Caron and Dariouche Safvate in 1966 at 136-140-224 cents, with the<br/>slight difference between the neutral second steps possibly seen as an<br/>inconsequential variation rather than a characteristic of this modal<br/>family.</p><p>In contrast, Hormoz Farhat&apos;s preferred tuning of 135-160-200 cents makes a<br/>very clear distinction between small and large neutral seconds, with the<br/>smaller preceding the larger, a distinction which he observes in describing<br/>and notating other dastgah-s (Persian plural dastgah-ha) or modal families<br/>also.</p><p>With subtle distinctions such as those which may be found in some regions<br/>of the Arab world where smaller and larger neutral intervals within the<br/>central range vary by considerably less than a comma, but possibly in<br/>meaningful patterns, close study is required.</p><p>For example, suppose we find that in a number of pieces in Maqam Rast and<br/>Maqam Bayyati as performed in the Egyptian tradition, neutral second sizes<br/>seem to vary within a range of around 135-155 cents. If we find further<br/>that the interval dugah-segah (Arabic dukah-sikah) tends to have a size of<br/>around 150-155 cents in Rast, where it leads from the major second to<br/>neutral third above the final, but 135-145 cents in Bayyati, where it leads<br/>from the final to the neutral second above, then there is evidently a<br/>subtle but significant difference. The 150-138 cent or 138-150 cent<br/>division available in my temperament provides an example of this kind of<br/>subtle distinction.</p><p>In fact, Scott Marcus reports that traditional Egyptian performers so hold<br/>that the step sikah (Turkish segah) should be lower in Bayyati than in<br/>Rast, and suggests a range of around 135-140 cents. He does not mention in<br/>the writings I have read any estimate for the size of dukah-sikah in Rast,<br/>so my hypothetical guess of 150-155 cents is simply that. Systematic<br/>measurements would place Marcus&apos;s observation in a broader and more fully<br/>fleshed out context.</p><p>On the other hand, we might among some performers or performances encounter<br/>a situation where a neutral second in Maqam Bayyati seems to hover &quot;around<br/>150 cents&quot; -- or possibly &quot;around 147 cents,&quot; the mean of 32/27 Pythagorean<br/>semiditone or minor third at 294 cents which Marcus suggests may be about<br/>the norm for many Egyptian performers -- with variations around this<br/>pattern of two essentially equal steps. Or, with performers who like Ali<br/>Jihad Racy prefer a minor third in Bayyati distinctly smaller than<br/>Pythagorean, we might encounter a division like that suggested by Tala&grave;i<br/>for the often analogous Persian modal family of Shur at 140-140-220 cents.</p><p>We should not expect a general consensus among all Near Eastern performers,<br/>even those in the same region sharing a similar tradition, on these<br/>points. Thus sources in the Syrian tradition give the usual tuning for the<br/>lower tetrachord of Maqam Bayyati as either 7-6-9 commas (Tawfiq al-Sabbagh<br/>as reported by Ali Jihad Racy) or 6-7-9 commas (one source reporting the<br/>practice of Aleppo). The former concept fits al-Sabbagh&apos;s 24-note gamut<br/>based on the 53-comma system which at the usual location for Bayyati<br/>accommodates only a 7-6-9 comma or 158-136-204 cent division, while the<br/>latter may also fit the traditional Egyptian performers described by<br/>Marcus. The Egyptian concept may, however, typically involve a more subtle<br/>distinction than suggested by the 6-7-9 concept -- say, for example<br/>something on the order of 140-154-204 cents if a 32/27 third or thereabouts<br/>is favored.</p><p>In short, a balanced appraisal should assume neither that EDO models with<br/>equal neutral seconds and/or thirds are the prevailing norm, nor that<br/>precisely or approximately equal divisions are always anathema to<br/>traditional performers. There is evidently a continuum ranging from<br/>essentially equal divisions with small and unsystematic variations through<br/>subtle but significant distinctions to routine differences on the order of<br/>a comma or even more, as with our supraminor/submajor steps and intervals<br/>differing by about 35 cents.</p><p>Marcus reports a perception among some Arab performers that sikah (or<br/>Turkish segah), the third of Maqam Rast, tends to rise as one travels from<br/>Egypt to Palestine or Lebanon, from there to Iraq, and finally to Turkey,<br/>where it may actually shift from a neutral to a major third. The<br/>perceptions of a Turkish musician such as Ozan Yarman support this<br/>suggested pattern at least in part: around 360 cents, which might be deemed<br/>an average or even somewhat bright Rast in much of the Arab world, is in<br/>Turkey a &quot;low&quot; Rast, with 370 cents close to the likely historical Ottoman<br/>norm, and somewhere close to 5/4 (Ozan has suggested 382 cents as one<br/>pleasant spot) as a high Rast of the kind which Marcus&apos;s Arab musicians may<br/>have found noteworthy.</p><p>The Lebanon composer and theorist Amine Beyhom likewise suggests that in<br/>different traditions of maqam music, the placement of the step sikah (or<br/>Turkish segah) may range from about 330 cents above rast (for a Bayyati in<br/>the popular Lebanese style, where the primary reference might actually be a<br/>placement about 130 cents above dukah, the major second step of Rast and<br/>the final of Bayyati) to a comma below Pythagorean in a Turkish Rast<br/>(i.e. 384-385 cents in a 53-comma model based on Pythagorean tuning or<br/>53-EDO). Ozan Yarman similarly identifies a number of flavors of segah on<br/>his 79-tone qanun ranging from around 332 to 392 cents.</p><p>In the study of how this range of 50 cents or more is actually used in<br/>different regional and personal practices as they affect different maqamat,<br/>almost everything remains to be done, despite some promising beginnings and<br/>insights by adept performers and listeners who provide a fine<br/>starting-point for further research.</p><p>With or without the use of superparticular or other rational ratios for<br/>neutral intervals as reference points, we can take a pragmatic approach in<br/>appreciating the great intonational diversity which actually obtains.</p><p>Most appreciatively,</p><p>Margo Schulter<br/>mschulter@...</p></div>
