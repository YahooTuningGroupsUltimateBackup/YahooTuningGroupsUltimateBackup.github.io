It seems a lot of musics avoid 7:4.<br/>&gt;&gt; Danielou has warnings about it.  The sruti don&apos;t go near it.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; eh... I thought that the African-American Blues do GO there...<br/>&gt; I could be mistaken... HEY MONZO!!! you seem to know!!!<br/>&gt; {cue J. Monzo...}</p><p>Altho the blues are almost always performed on instruments<br/>tuned in the 12-eq system, the vocal and instrumental styles<br/>feature lots of bending and sliding of pitches, and to my<br/>ears most definitely imply a lot of 7-limit ratios.</p><p>&gt; [zHANg, TD 394.12]<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; From: Patrick Pagano &lt;<a href="mailto:ppagano@bellsouth.net">ppagano@bellsouth.net</a>&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt; Danielou describes the 7 intervals as the demonic numbers<br/>&gt;&gt; or deva numbers drawing in powers us humans may not be able<br/>&gt;&gt; to understand<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; That is maybe why my Uncle hates African-American Blues &amp;<br/>&gt; Rock musics... He is very &quot;Sino-centric&quot; &amp; says that these<br/>&gt; musics have evil in their roots, that almost anything<br/>&gt; African-American is tainted by the bad blood of slavery<br/>&gt; &amp; that a people severed from their ancestors en masse have<br/>&gt; no hope of substantial recovery of their history... I say :<br/>&gt; opinions &amp; nether regions...</p><p>I haven&apos;t done enough research into African musical intonation<br/>to verify how closely it is reflected in African-American<br/>musical styles, but the intonation of the blues from early<br/>in this century, when its practitioners were largely ignorant<br/>of musical notation and theory, is very definitely microtonal,<br/>and it had to come from *somewhere*.</p><p>In _Deep Blues_, the late Robert Palmer describes what I<br/>think are quite plausible connections between blues vocal<br/>techniques and those of west-African music and speech.</p><p>As far as the intriguing idea that your uncle has of<br/>African-Americans not being able to recover their history<br/>because of their severance from Africa, I&apos;m not so sure...</p><p>I think if their &apos;history&apos; was maintained anywhere, it&apos;s<br/>in their music - this was just about the only thing the<br/>African slaves were allowed to practice in America without<br/>interference from their masters.  Altho even in music<br/>there was certainly a desire among some slaves to become<br/>assimilated to some extent into the dominant European-American<br/>culture, this desire for assimilation varied widely.  Some<br/>early blues recordings sound quite similar to west-African<br/>music I&apos;ve heard.</p><p>I speculated a while back in a posting here, when we were<br/>discussing Danielou&apos;s ideas, that it may be precisely the<br/>preponderance of 7-limit rational implications in blues<br/>that contributed to its being referred to as &apos;devil&apos;s music&apos;.</p><p>-monz</p><p>Joseph L.
