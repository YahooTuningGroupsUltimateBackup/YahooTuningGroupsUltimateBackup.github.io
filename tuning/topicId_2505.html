I think that &quot;ambiguous&quot; is<br/>&gt; indeed good way to describe it.</p><p>&gt; In particular, I&apos;ve found that we are so conditioned to think of<br/>&gt; thirds as either major or minor that when we hear something right<br/>&gt; between the two, our ears have a tendency from habit, to characterize<br/>&gt; it as one or the other.  The option to portray that kind of ambiguity<br/>&gt; can be a useful to tool for composers;  it makes listeners reconsider<br/>&gt; the basis behind our impressions of majors and minors.</p><p>I agree.</p><p>&gt; I find stacks of four, five, and more neutral thirds more interesting<br/>&gt; than just neutral triads.  That&apos;s true of 9:7s as well.</p><p>Interesting; I&apos;ll have to try that!</p><p>&gt; I have toyed with the idea of expanding an 88-cent interval size to<br/>&gt; somewhere around 88 1/4 cents to make it less like 41 per<br/>&gt; triple-octave.</p><p>I&apos;m afraid it&apos;s not clear to me why it&apos;s important to miss an n-octave.</p><p>&gt; Jeff mentioned not liking 9:7 as much as 11:9 and 7:6.  As I&apos;ve<br/>&gt; mentioned before on the list, I think the key to understanding 9:7 is<br/>&gt; to avoid thinking of it as a major-like third, but instead as a<br/>&gt; shocking or perhaps &quot;freaky&quot;-sounding third instead.</p><p>That&apos;s about how I&apos;d describe it!</p><p>JdL</p></div>
