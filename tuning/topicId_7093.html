them with an electric shock, and repeating this<br/>procedure, will this be come &quot;learned and ingrained&quot; into the plants memory?</p><p>Assumedly, we can breed the smarter ones, and teach them to calculate,<br/>recall colored light sequences, play the cello etc...</p><p>:o)</p><p>For this experiment, I will be produceing music using fairly pure tones on<br/>an Akai S2000 sampler, Cakewalk sequenceing software.</p><p>I have finished calculateing my SUperpower temperaments, and with these<br/>tools, I will be making some microtonal techno, one day.</p><p>To Mr.Warren Burt-I will sent you information on the four ways compositional<br/>programmeing soon, and, also, I will send you data about the superpower<br/>temperaments.</p><p>Please tell Brian McLaren that:</p><p>THERE IS ABSOLUTELY, POSITIVELY, NO REASON AT ALL TO WORRY ABOUT<br/>MICROTONALITY EVER DIEING OUT.</p><p>Should the interest in this form of wounderful musical expression ever die<br/>down, I should think that it will be &quot;discovered again&quot; one day, I mean we<br/>are running out of ideas.</p><p>If they (&quot;they&quot; being the media) can make a popular culture of teeny-boppers<br/>following and trying to hard to emulate an all girl Spice Girl wannabe<br/>lookalike from a New Zealand band of Vally Girls called &quot;True Bliss&quot;, and<br/>have people buy it in screeds, then gOd alone knows what can be done with<br/>something with TRUE potentiol like Xentonality....</p><p>I have a longer term view to doing a talk about microtonal music on student<br/>radio, called &quot;RadioActive&quot;, and this indeed could become a cult favorite<br/>with students.</p><p>I actually forgot to ask you people: Would you care to have yourselves<br/>mentioned for a moment of glory, on air?</p><p>This could be way down the track, but plans are afoot.</p><p>Comments please!</p><p>Sarn.</p></div>
