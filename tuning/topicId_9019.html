I suspect it is a<br/>6:7:9.</p><p>minor3.wav - third too low, but does not lock to the fundamental suggested<br/>by minor2</p><p>minor4.wav - does not lock to &quot;my&quot; minor third, but is close. Hold it! Is<br/>the fifth flat?</p><p>minor5.wav - very pleasant. I suspect this has a 5:6 lower third and a 4:5<br/>upper third wrapped in a nice 2:3 fifth.</p><p>minor6.wav - similar to minor5, but there is something slightly different.<br/>If pressed to say what it is, I&apos;d guess the third is a smidge higher.</p><p>minor8.wav - third is unpleasantly high</p><p>minor11.wav - third is almost a semitone high</p><p>minor12.wav - third even higher than minor11; nearly a major triad.</p><p>Okay. What are they?????</p><p>Jerry</p></div>
