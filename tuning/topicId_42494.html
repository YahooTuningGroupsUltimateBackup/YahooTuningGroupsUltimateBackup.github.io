It can be small (0.03 for the 19<br/>et) or large (-38.96 for 28 et, 22.48 for 87) depending on the<br/>relative error of major versus minor thirds.

For 11/41-comma meantone,<br/>we get a value of exactly -4; 3/11-comma meantone is just barely out<br/>of the poptimal range, and has a brat of -3.</p><p>Some other interesting values are 7/25-comma meantone, with a brat of<br/>-2, and 5/17-comma meantone, with a brat of -1. Robert of course is<br/>looking at 1/7-comma meantone, with a brat of +2. In case anyone is<br/>interested, the values for fifth and third we get for these exact<br/>rational meantone systems (q-comma meantone, with q a rational<br/>number, which is to say the same thing as the brat being rational or<br/>infinite) are algebraic numbers of degree four. In the case of 5/17<br/>and 1/7 comma meantone, the fifth is an algebraic integer.</p></div><h3><a id=42497 href="#42497">ðŸ”—</a>Gene Ward Smith &#x3C;gwsmith@svpal.org&#x3E; &#x3C;gwsmith@svpal.org&#x3E;</h3><span>2/23/2003 6:58:30 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;Gene Ward Smith &lt;gwsmith@s...&gt;&quot;<br/>&lt;gwsmith@s...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt; If t is the size of major third in some temperament, and f is the<br/>&gt; size of the fifth, then the ratio of the beats between the major<br/>&gt; third and minor third of a triad in close root position will be the<br/>b-<br/>&gt; ratio, or *brat*:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; brat = (6t - 5f)/(4t - 5)</p><p>If z = (f - 3/2)/(t - 5/4) is the ratio of errors of the<br/>approximation to the fifth over the approximation of the major third<br/>(*not* in terms of cents, but as frequency ratios) then</p><p>brat = 3/2 - 5/4 z</p><p>This should make it clear how it generalizes.</p></div><h3><a id=42516 href="#42516">ðŸ”—</a>Dave Keenan &#x3C;d.keenan@uq.net.au&#x3E; &#x3C;d.keenan@uq.net.au&#x3E;</h3><span>2/23/2003 8:49:34 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Gene,</p><p>Why only look at the ratio of minor third beats to major third beats?<br/>What about the beats in the fifth?
