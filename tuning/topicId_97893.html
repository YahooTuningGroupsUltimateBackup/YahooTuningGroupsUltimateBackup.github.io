Anybody saying<br/>&gt; &apos;and don&apos;t let so-and-so misdirect you with their sophistry&apos;<br/>&gt; should be just gone the 2nd time they do it. Nothing like<br/>&gt; that would tolerated for a second on any other mailing list<br/>&gt; or forum I can think of! It&apos;s completely ridiculous. The<br/>&gt; only reason to bring me up is because I&apos;m the guy who&apos;s<br/>&gt; confronted it in the past. I&apos;ll continue to do so, because<br/>&gt; tolerance of such behavior is ultimately the cause of the<br/>&gt; breakdowns you mention. But I&apos;d rather moderators do it,<br/>&gt; because that&apos;s their job. -Carl</p><p>I was going to discuss this offlist with you, but if this is going to<br/>involve a criticism of my moderational policy, then I think it&apos;s all<br/>the better that it is discussed online. I would love to get feedback<br/>from everyone on how they would like to see the moderators handle<br/>situations like these on the list.</p><p>I was offered a &quot;position&quot; as moderator on this list because you<br/>wanted to step down, pass the torch, were tired of being constantly<br/>criticized, and because you said you thought I had good judgment. Now<br/>that I&apos;m here, I am going to do my job. This means that I may do<br/>things differently than you did, but I&apos;d be happy to get feedback from<br/>you or anyone else on it.</p><p>In this case, I brought you up because I saw a random negative comment<br/>directed towards &quot;Carl&quot; in a thread that had nothing to do with you.<br/>This has happened more than once. I was going to led it slide, but as<br/>you clearly didn&apos;t appreciate being randomly attacked out of nowhere,<br/>and as stuff like this from all sides has been getting on my nerves a<br/>lot recently, I thought it best to address it publicly. I don&apos;t think<br/>that this list should turn into a source of stress for anyone, or that<br/>anyone should feel depressed about their involvement on it. It has<br/>become crystal clear to me recently that if it weren&apos;t for this list&apos;s<br/>penchant for random personal attacks, we&apos;d be covering an enormous<br/>amount of ground.</p><p>This time, I feel Cam was in the wrong. There are other previous times<br/>where I felt that you were the aggressor. At those times, I would ask<br/>you to stop, which you generally do. Caleb posted a message ragging on<br/>Jon Szanto a while ago, and I politely asked him to stop as well. I<br/>didn&apos;t put anyone on moderation or ban anyone, and I am now extending<br/>the same courtesy to Cameron by politely giving him the chance to cut<br/>out remarks like that from his posts. If he refuses and keeps<br/>expressing how he thinks he&apos;s of intellectually superior stature than<br/>you, then things will change.</p><p>I prefer this because I think that it is humiliating and unnecessary<br/>to just immediately threaten to ban or moderate someone. Everyone gets<br/>heated or bummed out sometimes and posts negative things they later<br/>regret. I think that this is a fact of life that should be predicted<br/>and accounted for in advance when moderating this list. We are adults,<br/>and I think everyone should have the chance to comply with a simple<br/>request to please not resort to personal attacks. If they really just<br/>continue repeatedly with it and refuse to stop, at that point do I<br/>think that it&apos;s proper to put them on moderation until they cool off.</p><p>If people think that the &quot;ask politely -&gt; warn -&gt; moderate -&gt; ban&quot;<br/>approach is a bad system, I would be happy to do something else.<br/>Whatever I do means that it will apply across the board. It could be<br/>that if Cam posts something negative about Carl and Carl complains<br/>about it, I chastise him publicly by putting Cam on moderation. It<br/>also means that if Carl posts something negative about Cam and Cam<br/>complains about it offlist, I will also put Carl on moderation. Or if<br/>Michael S says something negative about Carl, or if Carl says<br/>something negative about Michael S, or if Paul Erlich rejoins and says<br/>something negative about Jon Szanto, I put everyone on moderation.</p><p>I could do that, or I could basically act as a liaison to resolve<br/>tension between people who sometimes clash, and use moderation only if<br/>the aggressor really just refuses to stop. Despite these occasional<br/>clashes, I think that we have an otherwise really nice community here,<br/>and hope we can self-regulate it like adults. If everyone feels this<br/>isn&apos;t working, I could do something else.</p><p>Whatever everyone thinks, let me know, but keep in mind that the<br/>&quot;rules&quot; bind you too. And I will bind myself by whatever rules we<br/>choose, and will never censor or limit criticism of any part of my<br/>moderation on this forum.</p><p>-Mike</p></div><h3><a id=97894 href="#97894">ðŸ”—</a>Jake Freivald &#x3C;jdfreivald@...&#x3E;</h3><span>4/12/2011 2:39:04 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Mike,</p><p>I&apos;ve been the moderator of a variety of lists, ranging from groups of<br/>Catholics to Army Rangers, and it&apos;s not always an easy job. Thanks for<br/>taking on the task; this list is clearly not an easy one to moderate.</p><p>I&apos;ve found that it&apos;s best to let people know the affected parties<br/>(offlist) when you feel that someone has been out of line, and have<br/>steady consequences for getting further out of line.</p><p>In this case, you could warn Cameron offlist that you felt his comment<br/>was out of line, cc:ing Carl so he knows that you&apos;re taking action.<br/>Don&apos;t put it out to the list, and don&apos;t allow people to send<br/>meta-conversation out to the list. Just tell Cameron and Carl. If<br/>Cameron continues to make disparaging comments, moderate him and him<br/>alone, rejecting messages that seem out of line. Only unmoderate him<br/>when it seems like he&apos;s gotten the point. Similarly, if Carl protests<br/>onlist, he could be moderated as well. The level of meta-discussion is<br/>just way too high.</p><p>It seems to me that Carl&apos;s not exactly an angel here either. If his<br/>comments are too rude and provocative, you can tell him that and, if<br/>he doesn&apos;t lighten up, moderate him as well. Normally I wouldn&apos;t<br/>moderate someone just for being brusque, but if it&apos;s a consistent<br/>problem then you could use moderation as a tool.</p><p>Occasional moderation of individuals allows for people to cool down,<br/>and it reminds them of the fact that their words have consequences.<br/>Moderate someone if they get too heated too quickly perseverate on<br/>some personal issue. Also watch for those who *occasionally* send out<br/>something that appears designed to piss people off. If they send<br/>something once every few weeks, say, they sometimes feel that the<br/>moderator will say, &quot;Hey, cut that out!&quot; but there&apos;ll be no real<br/>consequences; then they&apos;ll be a jerk again a few weeks later, and the<br/>offended party just has to deal with it. To hell with that. Feel free<br/>to put those people on moderation indefinitely until they can prove<br/>that they&apos;re not going to be jerks anymore. I once had a guy on<br/>moderation for almost a year. It was no skin off my nose if his posts<br/>went out more slowly.</p><p>You won&apos;t satisfy everyone, but it&apos;s not your job to satisfy everyone.</p><p>I&apos;ve only had to moderate an entire list once or twice, and I&apos;ve<br/>banned very few people. It&apos;s better, in my opinion, to let people get<br/>away with too much than to talk too little. That said, people should<br/>know that your job is to be the bastard if need be, and that &quot;going<br/>too far&quot; is defined by your perception of the situation, not theirs.<br/>That&apos;s the only way you can do your job, after all.</p><p>So that&apos;s my opinion: Be the bastard! I&apos;m certainly willing to put up with that.</p><p>Respectfully,<br/>Jake</p></div>
