It&apos;s very<br/>exciting to see such a promising technique developed in good part<br/>through this Tuning List, and also to see how critical response can<br/>become more and more favorable as a new technique matures.</p><p>Just as in computer programming there are proverbially no nontrivial<br/>programs without bugs, so in music and tuning, trying any new method<br/>inevitably involves &quot;glitches,&quot; &quot;infelicities,&quot; and results which may<br/>not only illustrate the limitations of first attempts but point the<br/>way to next developments. The &quot;adaptive tuning&quot; saga so far may<br/>nicely illustrate these points.</p><p>Although I don&apos;t have the technical means I suspect may be required to<br/>process your files, and also the music might be a bit &quot;modern&quot; for me<br/>to judge &lt;grin&gt;, I am getting a great vicarious thrill hearing the<br/>critical response of people like Paul Erlich. When he said that your<br/>setting sounded like it was played on a fixed-pitch instrument, that<br/>was _really_ exciting!</p><p>As far as the question of a base tuning -- 12-tone equal temperament<br/>(12-tet), or 31-tet, or something else -- I would be much inclined to<br/>follow the approach you outlined in a recent post: see what tuning<br/>makes most musical sense for a given composition. This is also Mark<br/>Lindley&apos;s method for deciding whether an early 16th-century lute<br/>piece, for example, might be best in Pythagorean, meantone, or 12-tet,<br/>all possible tunings in that era before 12-tet was &quot;standardized&quot; for<br/>the instrument maybe around the 1540&apos;s.</p><p>I&apos;m tempted to add that your arrangements might sound considerably<br/>_smoother_ than my idea of 16th-century 5-limit JI on a fixed keyboard<br/>-- or actually _two_ such keyboards -- using a 15-note tuning based on<br/>Zarlino&apos;s JI keyboard layout with G-D just on one keyboard and D-A on<br/>the other. (Zarlino uses split keys rather than two manuals, but the<br/>intervals should be the same.)</p><p>Anyway, for pieces where diesis distinctions (e.g. G#/Ab) seem a<br/>feature rather than a bug, I would agree that your proposal for 31-tet<br/>is a very nice choice: it&apos;s documented by Lemme Rossi in 1666, and is<br/>close enough to circulating meantone 31 (1/4-comma) to be just about<br/>equivalent for earlier Renaissance and Manneristic music also, if your<br/>experiments at some point run in that direction. The precise<br/>mathematical symmetry of 31-tet might make things a bit simpler, and<br/>if you follow the &quot;not-quite-precisely-just-consonances&quot; approach<br/>sometimes advocated here, the slight difference between a 31-tet major<br/>third and a pure 5:4 might also be at least as much a feature as a<br/>compromise.</p><p>While I&apos;m hesitant to make any proposals which might maybe be detours<br/>on your &quot;road to Parnassus&quot; which you are negotiating very<br/>successfully as is, I wonder about the possibility for some 18th-19th<br/>century music of a base scale based on an unequal 12-tone (or larger,<br/>as Paul Erlich has mentioned in a different context) well-temperament,<br/>for example.</p><p>The idea that occurred to me as that maybe vertical intervals in all<br/>transpositions could be equally consonant, but melodic steps or<br/>adjustments might somehow vary to give a certain kind of &quot;key color.&quot;<br/>Again, this raises the question of whether such variations (originally<br/>in vertical tension, also) are a positive feature of the music, at<br/>least for some composers, or for other composers or pieces more of a<br/>concession to the exigencies of fixed tuning.</p><p>This last question can be a very elusive one: if Werckmeister or Bach<br/>could have somehow come up with a keyboard with pure fifths and thirds<br/>everywhere, would they have embraced it -- or have found it too<br/>&quot;bland&quot; compared to the variety of tension in a usual<br/>well-temperament?</p><p>Sometimes this question of intentions can be an elusive one. When I<br/>see a spelled-out diminished fourth in a vocal or keyboard composition<br/>of the 16th century (e.g. G#-C, usually between two upper parts), I<br/>tend to read it as a deliberate choice for something not too far from<br/>32:25 (~427 cents), or at any rate an interval in meantone or some<br/>vocal approximation of 5-limit JI quite different from a usual major<br/>third.</p><p>Thus I may not be especially pleased when I read a music history from<br/>40 years or so back taking a 16th-century composition with various<br/>neat diminished or augmented intervals of this kind and proposing that<br/>the notation should be interpreted by rewriting it as if this were<br/>12-tet, so that G#-C were just a &quot;fancy&quot; way of asking for Ab-C.</p><p>For the 18th century, however, and also for 16th-century lute music<br/>and at least some 17th-century keyboard music (Froberger, maybe some<br/>Frescobaldi), questions can get a lot more complicated. For the lute,<br/>by around 1545 or 1550, 12-tet seems standard, and we know from two<br/>theorists of very different bents, the radical Vincenzo Galilei and<br/>the conservative Artusi, that the equivalent of diminished fourths and<br/>sevenths on lute to regular major thirds and sixths was a feature<br/>noted and exploited by composers.</p><p>From a philosophical point of view, maybe I&apos;d prefer to speak not of<br/>&quot;pain&quot; but of &quot;stress&quot; in considering either vertical or melodic<br/>deviations from some ideal of interval size or scale symmetry, etc.</p><p>Thus while I might describe a tuning such as 1/4-comma meantone as not<br/>in any usual sense &quot;painful&quot; for Renaissance music, I would<br/>nevertheless recognize that the tempering of the fifths, for example,<br/>involves a degree of &quot;stress&quot; -- some stress possibly being a usual<br/>norm in music as in life.</p><p>We have evidence that in the 16th century this stress was generally<br/>taken for granted, but also that some attempts to remove it by the use<br/>of classic or adaptive JI keyboards (e.g. Zarlino&apos;s classic 5-limit<br/>scheme and Vicentino&apos;s 38-note adaptive scheme) were regarded as<br/>striking enough in effect to merit some technical complications, even<br/>if mainly on an experimental basis.</p><p>However, these historical musings quite aside, &quot;nothing succeeds like<br/>success.&quot; Maybe what you&apos;ve done is something like my approach of<br/>realizing early music on synthesizer -- but in some ways more<br/>challenging, because you are devising new aesthetic algorithms, as it<br/>were, and dealing with very delicate parameters of melody and<br/>verticality.</p><p>Having added these odd remarks, I want again to congratulate you on<br/>the latest results, and also for your patience as well as creativity<br/>in reaching them.</p><p>Most appreciatively,</p><p>Margo Schulter<br/><a href="mailto:mscnulter@value.net">mscnulter@value.net</a></p></div>
