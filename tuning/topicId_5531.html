Szanto &#x3C;jszanto@xxxx.xxxx&#x3E;</h3><span>10/15/1999 11:45:09 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>William,</p><p>{you wrote...}<br/> &gt;I must remember my smileys!</p><p>Oh, hell, I just need to remember how inadequate ASCII text is for meaning!<br/>While I believe strongly in some of the stuff, it&apos;s hard to know<br/>(sometimes) when it&apos;s &quot;tongue-in-cheek&quot; or &quot;fist-in-air&quot;! Hope I didn&apos;t<br/>seem to take too much offense...</p><p> &gt;but I have deep suspicions about anyone who complains about<br/> &gt;the excessive abstraction of plainchant.  My own feeling is that the<br/> &gt;best musical system has some balance between abstraction and<br/> &gt;corporeality.</p><p>I would view the point as being: that is what makes sense to you, but not<br/>necessarily to someone like Partch. While some cast him as merely &apos;cranky&apos;,<br/>it is more the case that he was almost completely uncompromising in his<br/>beliefs, *where his music/work was concerned*. I might not agree with him,<br/>as well, but I certainly don&apos;t mind someone clearly defining their own<br/>aesthetic boundaries.</p><p>And he *did* go out of his way to *not* tell anyone else what they should<br/>do, though he railed against the status quo almost non-stop for decades.</p><p> &gt;I&apos;ve not seen anyone here endorse what I take to be Partch&apos;s strongest<br/> &gt;statements regarding corporeality.</p><p>Well, I probably would!  :)</p><p>---[ And now, Mr. Carl:<br/> &gt;What do you want to do?  I confess I&apos;ve never done percussion parts with<br/> &gt;them, but other than that...</p><p>Great, buddy: you haven&apos;t done them, but you&apos;re willing to propose that the<br/>electronic equivalents of copying music can do everything. How do you know<br/>that?</p><p> &gt;Saving time?  It&apos;s just like the difference between word processing and<br/> &gt;writing.  If you&apos;re going to edit, it&apos;s much faster.</p><p>*Once* a file is in, it is possible to edit and tweak and print out with<br/>comparable results with hand work. OTOH, sometimes getting in a score, and<br/>putting in all the nuances (dynamics, expressions, etc.) can take a whole<br/>lot of time. And then there is the layout...</p><p> &gt;If you&apos;re just going to put it in and print, it depends on your typing<br/>skills.</p><p>Not if the program insists on making the music appear one way when you want<br/>another. Good copyists have a sixth sense about how to lay out the notes on<br/>a page, spacing, planning page turns, etc. The automation of part<br/>extraction is still not completely there. As for having to actually read<br/>this stuff (and I don&apos;t mean practicing it for days or weeks, but having to<br/>sight read and then record), some of the page layout can be abominable. It<br/>is comparable to badly justified text in a word processor, with bad text<br/>kerning and font spacing, as compared to a good publishing program (or<br/>layout artist) that can do correct proportional text alignment -- such a<br/>delight for the eyes and mind.</p><p>All that said, I use Finale regularly, but I also know when *not* to use<br/>it, as well as ask a producer for room in the budget for a professional<br/>copyist.</p><p>And I have all faith that the notation programs *will* get there, but also<br/>have parallel doubts that, by virtue of market, they won&apos;t include the<br/>esoteric features that some of the composers on this list might like to see.</p><p>Now go input Varese&apos;s &quot;Ionization&quot; into Finale and report back when done...  :)</p><p>Have a nice weekend, folks!<br/>Jon</p><p>&grave;&apos;&grave;&apos;&grave;&apos;&grave;&apos;&grave;&apos;&grave;&apos;&grave;&apos;&grave;&apos;&grave;&apos;&grave;&apos;&grave;&apos;&grave;&apos;&grave;&apos;&grave;&apos;&grave;&apos;&grave;&apos;&grave;&apos;&grave;&apos;&grave;&apos;&grave;&apos;&grave;&apos;&grave;&apos;&grave;&apos;&grave;&apos;&grave;&apos;&grave;&apos;&grave;&apos;&grave;&apos;&grave;&apos;&grave;&apos;&grave;&apos;&grave;&apos;&grave;&apos;&grave;<br/>    Jonathan M.

Have you ever sat down in<br/>front of a hand-written part that you couldn&apos;t read?  I have.  Tiny little<br/>notes, sitting half-way between line and space, un-evenly spaced ledger<br/>lines, on a 1st trumpet part crammed on the same staff with the 2nd trumpet<br/>part.  The score entry program gives the composer a chance to improve his<br/>hand writing.</p><p>-Carl</p></div><h3><a id=5554 href="#5554">ðŸ”—</a>Jonathan M.

Another was multiple meter signatures running concurrently in<br/>different staves (i.e. changing metrics in each part, not coinciding<br/>vertically). And it is very possible that some of these can be done (and<br/>maybe in the newest versions). But it was *way* more trouble and time than<br/>the old way.</p><p>Though I love them for quick-and-dirty arrangements.</p><p>&gt;Why do you assume that every automatic feature that can be used must be<br/>&gt;used when inputing a file?</p><p>I don&apos;t.</p><p>&gt;I&apos;ve spent hours hand-spacing notes in Encore.</p><p>I&apos;ve got better uses for my time on this planet; the notes would have been<br/>spaced properly the first time, for me, by hand.

I&apos;ll restate: the current generation of notation tools is<br/>*not* at the same production-level use as DTP, such as Quark.</p><p>&gt;True, but what of the other side of things?  Have you ever sat down in<br/>&gt;front of a hand-written part that you couldn&apos;t read?</p><p>Yes, copying can be butchered by hand. I have suffered through that as<br/>well. My point is that many people today believe slapping a CD-ROM into the<br/>computer and loading a program will solve their problems, and it won&apos;t; we<br/>need healthy, objective looks at all of these panacea(s). It all started<br/>with the statement that Finale, et al, can do anything. That is too broad a<br/>statement at this stage of the game.</p><p>And now we are way OT for the tuning list, so let&apos;s go off-list if you want<br/>to discuss more.

It all started<br/>&gt;with the statement that Finale, et al, can do anything. That is too broad a<br/>&gt;statement at this stage of the game.</p><p>That wasn&apos;t my statement.  I said score entry programs, and I actually<br/>meant it in principle, not with respect to any &quot;current generation&quot; of<br/>software.  But I&apos;ve been arguing that anyway, because I think the current<br/>generation is quite good for anybody that (1) has half a brain (2) already<br/>knows how to write music and (3) is willing to spend the first month of use<br/>learning it.  Current generation software has provisions for putting<br/>anything on the page I could want, so far as I know today.  It doesn&apos;t have<br/>provision for turning that into sound, yet, as I mentioned originally in<br/>this thread:</p><p>&gt;First to check are LIME &lt;<a href="http://datura.cerl.uiuc.edu">http://datura.cerl.uiuc.edu</a>&gt;, Sibelius<br/>&gt;&lt;<a href="http://www.sibelius.com">http://www.sibelius.com</a>&gt;, and Finale &lt;<a href="http://www.codamusic.com">http://www.codamusic.com</a>&gt;.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;None of these can do what I want exactly, so let me no if you turn up<br/>&gt;anything else.</p><p>&gt;And now we are way OT for the tuning list,</p><p>Rubbish!  :)</p><p>-Carl</p></div>
