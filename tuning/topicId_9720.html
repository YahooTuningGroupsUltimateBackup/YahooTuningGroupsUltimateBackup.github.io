So now when<br/>replying, instead of using the reply function in the email program, many of<br/>us are instead copying the message to which we wish to reply, including the<br/>header which does include the sender&apos;s address. The result is that the<br/>replies now appear very cluttered with irrelevant stuff. I&apos;m not sure that<br/>I&apos;ve described the situation with complete accuracy, but I think that the<br/>mess is the result of egroups policy of not putting the sender&apos;s address in<br/>the body of the message. In any case I would like to have egroups reinstate<br/>the FROM field in the body of the message, and I have been emailing<br/><a href="mailto:support@egroups.com">support@egroups.com</a> daily with complaints. If any of you think it matters I<br/>hope that you&apos;ll join me in my campaign.</p><p>Please not that I&apos;m CCing this message to <a href="mailto:support@egroups.com">support@egroups.com</a>.</p><p>John Link</p><p>**************************************************************************<br/>To purchase the CD &quot;Live at Saint Peter&apos;s&quot; by the JOHN LINK VOCAL QUINTET,<br/>visit <a href="http://WWW.JOHNLINKMUSIC.COM">WWW.JOHNLINKMUSIC.COM</a>, or write to <a href="mailto:johnlink@con2.com">johnlink@con2.com</a>.<br/>**************************************************************************</p></div>
