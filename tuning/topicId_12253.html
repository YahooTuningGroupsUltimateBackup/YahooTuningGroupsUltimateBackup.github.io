Yes, the players can<br/>play accurately with 50 cents.  Sorry if you can&apos;t imagine that they can:<br/>they simply can.</p><p>It is not possible to have only a FEW players play accurately to the cent:<br/>ALL must play accurately or the music is out of tune.</p><p>Each instrument negotiates the cent distinctions differently.  However, when<br/>the mind is crystal clear and the technique is a given (as with the jobbing<br/>musicians) then they can and do play accurately to the cent.  Now, this<br/>situation is still improving and has been, steadily over the last 2 decades<br/>in New York.  Certainly, you might realize that there are different stratum<br/>of musicians to deal with.  Partch dealt with non-virtuosi intentionally.<br/>Happily, I am most comfortable with the virtuosi.</p><p>Johnny Reinhard</p></div><h3><a id=12256 href="#12256">ðŸ”—</a>Afmmjr@aol.com</h3><span>9/3/2000 1:58:52 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Reinhard&apos;s &quot;cents-ers&quot; has nothing to do with &quot;censures.&quot;  Matter of fact,<br/>cents notations allows for all tunings.
