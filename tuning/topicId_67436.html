Recently I wanted to construct a 60 note pythagorean just temperment<br/>and so used the following commands with the software &apos;Scala&apos;, found at;<br/>  <a href="http://www.xs4all.nl/~huygensf/scala/">http://www.xs4all.nl/~huygensf/scala/</a><br/>  The commands I used were;<br/>  type &quot;pythag&quot; in the box at the bottom, followed by<br/>the following answers to the prompts:<br/>  size= 60<br/>formal octave= [return]<br/>fifth degree= [return]<br/>formal fifth= 3/2<br/>count downwards= [return]<br/>  type &quot;show&quot;<br/>  This gave me a listing of the ratios (fractions) for the complete musical scale.<br/>  HOWEVER,<br/>  I&apos;d like to do the same thing for a completely different type of scale, an unsual one;<br/>  (what are the commands to use?

It sounds almost completely chaotic, unpredictable<br/>  The ratio of these numbers is the division of seven, an interval between the overtones not used in other harmonic structures. 7/7, 7/6, 7/5, 7/4, 7/3, 7/2, 7/1. Out of this structure of fundamental tones, emerges five intervals. By doubling the five-tone scale we attain the oldest existing scale tenfold scale, called the Slendro scale, much older then the Pythagorean sevenfold octave.<br/>  The one seventh interval is different from the major second of 1/9 and 1/10.

The seventh harmonic can be heard as an overtone or undertone in some instruments, particularly those rich in timbre (which means harmonics) such as a violin.<br/>  When the acoustic seventh is taken as the basic interval for the creation of a musical scale, new tones and intervals (distances between the notes) result. The 7 to 4 ratio of the natural seventh harmonic creates a new musical scale, a five tone, pentatonic scale.<br/>  What unique effective temperament system based on the natural harmonics of the seventh itself would give the best resuts to get a functionaing music scale, NOT based on square root of 2, and what would it look like based on the square root of two?</p><p> &#x9;&#x9;&#x9;&#x9;<br/>---------------------------------<br/>Want to be your own boss?
