The sheet is cut through at a<br/>particular angle to provide the non-periodicity.</p><p>The 3-d Penrose tilings are projections of a 3D surface of a section cut<br/>through the lattice of 6-D cubes in 6D space.</p><p>So the triacontrahedron is from this projection of a 3-D surface in 6D regular<br/>lattice of 6-D cubes.</p><p>But how much of the surface is it? I&apos;ve wondered that.</p><p>It has edges in all six directions, so must be a projection of parts of at least<br/>two 5-d cube faces.</p><p>However it has nowhere near enough rhombohedral cells to be a projection<br/>of even as much as a complete 5-D face.</p><p>Here are the numbers for n-dim cubes, as I&apos;ve just calc. on back of envelope<br/>as it were:</p><p>n+1 dim cube = 2 n dim cubes with lines joining all pts of one to the other.</p><p>if P k n = number of k dim faces in n dim. cube (k=0 == pts)<br/>then it follows that</p><p>P i n+1 = 2*Pi n + P i-1 n<br/>For i=0<br/>P 0 n+1 = 2*P 0 n</p><p>E.g. P 2 4 = number of squares in hypercube = 2*P 2 3 + P 1 3<br/>because you get the hypercube from two copies of the cube joined<br/>to each other using lines to connect matching points in each,<br/>and each line in the cube becomes a square when the two copies are<br/>joined together, and you have all the squares from both copies as well.</p><p>So numbers of pts, lines etc are:<br/>(2, 1) // two pts, one line</p><p>(2*2, 2*1+2, 1)<br/>=<br/>(4, 4, 1) // 4 pts, 4 lines, 1 square</p><p>(8, 2*4+4, 2*1+4, 1)<br/>=<br/>(8, 12, 6, 1) // 8 pts, 12 lines, six squares, 1 cube</p><p>// leave out calc. now:<br/>(16, 32, 24, 8, 1) // 16 pts, 32 lines, 24 squares, 8 cubes, 1 hypercube<br/>(32, 80, 80, 40, 10, 1) // 32 pts, 80 lines, 80 squares, 40 cubes, 10 hypercubes, 1 5-D cube<br/>(64,192, 240, 160, 60, 12, 1) // 64 pts, 192 lines, 240 squares, 160 cubes, 60 hypercubes, 12 5-D cubes, 1 6-D cube</p><p>So the 20 golden rhombohedra in the triacontrahedron are a projection of half<br/>the total number of 40 cubes in the 5-D face.</p><p>But we know they aren&apos;t from only one 5-D face because of the six directions.</p><p>That&apos;s as far as I&apos;ve got so far,</p><p>I&apos;ll see what Coxeter has to say about triacontrahedra in projections from 6-D space.</p><p>Robert</p></div>
