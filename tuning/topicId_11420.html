See <a href="http://freenote.com">freenote.com</a> for more info on his work.</p><p>Most likely, there are other jazz guitarists using microtones<br/>of whom I&apos;m not aware.</p><p>And if the Guitar-List poster is looking for a &apos;big name&apos;<br/>guitarist who was microtonal, he&apos;ll certainly find one in<br/>the realm of rock: Jimi Hendrix had an absolute mastery of<br/>pitch-bending, along with everything else about playing the<br/>electric guitar.</p><p>-monz</p><p>Joseph L.
