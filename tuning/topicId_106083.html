Was too blind on something :-)</p><p>There seem to be two things that interfere on that level of my interest. First is something that internet calls &quot;displacement frequencies&quot; (at small difference - pitch centers), and second - interval points from harmonic series.</p><p>As for displacement freqs, I found that name following a math formula that emerged from practical experiments. They show something like this. If you have two sine sounds, f1 and f2, then you have a (f1+f2)/2 frequency point, that will vibrate with third f3 sound, close to that point. So if you make f1 = 1000Hz and f2 1200Hz, then mid freq is 1100Hz. If you play a third tone let say f3 = 1101Hz, then you get a 1Hz vibration.</p><p>As for intervals - If you have two sounds, f1 and f2, then f2 will produce such vibration at N*f1 points (harmonics; have to figure out to which N it is useful). But... Both, f1 and f2 can be considered as Nth harmonics of something lower else, so now I have to check to which degree it is usefu. I suspect, that 4 harmonics down (which produces 0.25 fractional harmonic steps) will be enough.</p><p>These two combined with each other, if they cross, they probably produce even stronger effect, or they change the nature of effect (consonance or something like that). Did I miss or over-complicated something?</p><p>Anyway - now it should be easier to create something that calculates these harmonic flows.</p><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;ayamahambho&quot; &lt;ayamahambho@...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I don&apos;t speak about binaural beats.
