There&apos;s no right click + open in same window option<br/>in that case.</p><p>I think losing the back button when one goes to the new page is the biggest drawback<br/>with popups.</p><p>However, it is very nice to be able to open a new window with one click instead<br/>of the clumsier right click + menu + select, if that is what one wants to do.</p><p>One solution I&apos;m experimenting with is to add a second link (open in new window)<br/>after the link.</p><p>Robert</p></div>
