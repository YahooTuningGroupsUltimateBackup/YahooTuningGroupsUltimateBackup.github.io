And although it wasn&apos;t explicit I&apos;d like to underline that<br/>the &quot;avenues&quot; are not necessarily avenues &quot;out&quot; but rather avenues &quot;within&quot;,<br/>including asking for what you want and inspiring others by setting examples<br/>of that.</p><p>The multi-media approach is of course a lot more work and I suspect that is<br/>part of the reason why it is not happening more.

A fully &quot;fleshed out&quot; conversation with all of<br/>these elements and others is likely to engage the interest of just about<br/>everybody here, and I think for those of us who are interested it is a<br/>worthy goal to make the extra effort to seek to include this<br/>multi-dimensionality in what we write.  Perhaps it is possible that nothing<br/>&quot;dry&quot; ever need be written.  To hang out and converse with people who have<br/>either more or less facility in certain specialized forms of language than<br/>we have takes some...   something - I was going to say &quot;effort&quot; or perhaps<br/>&quot;persistence&quot; - but what I am really getting at has more to do with having a<br/>personal ease, a curiosity, a suspension of judgement, and and<br/>acknowledgement of what we are attracted to, what we wish for, and the sense<br/>of freedom and generosity to give words to all of that, as we experience it.</p><p>-Kurt</p></div><h3><a id=53116 href="#53116">ðŸ”—</a>Gene Ward Smith &#x3C;gwsmith@svpal.org&#x3E;</h3><span>4/12/2004 4:18:02 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;Jon Szanto&quot; &lt;JSZANTO@A...&gt; wrote:</p><p>&gt; Please, dear man, do get a grip. &quot;Savagely flamed&quot; is a pretty<br/>gross<br/>&gt; overstatement, especially since you are more than able to deal out<br/>the<br/>&gt; stuff yourself.</p><p>I&apos;ve never flamed anyone for discussing tuning on this list, as you<br/>have.
