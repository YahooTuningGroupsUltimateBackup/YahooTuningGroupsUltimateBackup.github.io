Yes, it&apos;s not explicitly mentioned as such, but looking at your data, when<br/>you say compare, in scala &apos;showbeats&apos;, the beat rates of the fifths of 1/4<br/>comma meantone with 1/4-eqbeating meantone (meanquareq.scl), we see that the<br/>beatrate for the C-G of the 1/4 comma normal meantone is applied as the<br/>beatrate for all of the fifths of the 1/4 comma equal-beating meantone.</p><p>What I was getting at was taking a just C-E, and making the fifths (and<br/>fourths) of C-G-D-A-E all equal beat the syntonic comma. From what you&apos;ve<br/>described, I&apos;m not sure how scala would do this..at least, you&apos;d need to give<br/>more detailed instructions about how to do it. Would one change the formal<br/>octave to a 17th, or a 3rd? It&apos;s not clear how to proceed... From there, I&apos;d<br/>tune the usual meantone bearing plan....up and down major thirds from C, G,<br/>D, A, and up a third from E......</p><p>Best,<br/>Aaron.</p><p>--<br/>OCEAN, n.

Degree four and<br/>less polynomials are solveable, so their roots can be expressed<br/>purely algebraically (for instance in terms of radicals, though this<br/>really isn&apos;t the best choice.) Degree five and higher requires<br/>introduction of new functions, which could even be algebraic but<br/>which in practice have mostly been transcendental. Degree five, for<br/>instance, can be solved by adding the Dedekind eta function to the<br/>list of allowable functions. However, there are always special cases<br/>in all degrees which are solvable (when the Galois group of the<br/>splitting field over the base field is a solvable group.)</p></div><h3>Paul Erlich &#x3C;paul@stretch-music.com&#x3E;</h3><span>10/7/2003 12:50:08 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;Aaron K.
