This of course leads to a shift<br/>in absolute pitch of 80:81 each time the sequence repeats.  To<br/>counteract this tendency, I add grounding springs, which connect each<br/>instance of each pitch class to a particular tuning.

Each pitch class would be evaluated for ideal grounding via<br/>the COFT calculation, but a given combination of notes sounding together<br/>would get a calculated optimal grounding position (some kind of weighted<br/>average of the individual notes), which would be expressed as a single<br/>grounding spring.
