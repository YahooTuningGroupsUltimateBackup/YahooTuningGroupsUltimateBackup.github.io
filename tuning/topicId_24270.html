I suppose perhaps there&apos;s a tiny bit of misunderstanding,<br/>in that I really wasn&apos;t *intentionally* showing &quot;deviations<br/>from 12-tET&quot;...

Cleonides divides the &quot;perfect 4th&quot; into<br/>30 presumably equal parts.  (There is a question about<br/>whether they were intended to be equal.)  So the formula<br/>is: 1 moria = (4/3)^(1/30), just a fly-hair wider than<br/>16 &amp; 3/5 (16.6) cents.</p><p>The newer definition (does it originate with you, Manuel?)<br/>equates the moria with 1 degree of 72-EDO [= 2^(1/72) ],<br/>which is exactly 16 &amp; 2/3 (16.66...) cents.</p><p>&gt;<br/>&gt; 2) Why do you use fractional divisions of 72-tET that<br/>&gt; are the same number of divisions of the tiny unit as<br/>&gt; the number of divisions of the octave of the basic scale<br/>&gt; you are investigating?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I should be &quot;getting&quot; this, but I&apos;m not.

If you could run this down a bit<br/>&gt; more with some examples I would GREATLY appreciate it!</p><p>I didn&apos;t plan those fractional divisions, Joe... that&apos;s<br/>how the math works out.  Any time you divide the 2:1 into<br/>an equal number of parts, it is going to divide into cents<br/>in even fractions without remainders, because the cents<br/>are also an equal division.</p><p>As I said, I never realized this on my own and it was<br/>brought to my attention in an email Dan sent me.  He<br/>didn&apos;t say anything about it, but it struck me how the<br/>cents values for 13-EDO divided into 1/13ths of a cent:</p><p>&gt; [private email from Dan Stearns:]<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; 13-tET becomes:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;     [cents]     [144-EDO notation]<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;     0          C<br/>&gt;    92 &amp;  4/13  +~Db...(+~C#)<br/>&gt;   184 &amp;  8/13  +D<br/>&gt;   276 &amp; 12/13  &gt;~Eb...(&gt;~Eb)<br/>&gt;   369 &amp;  3/13  &gt;E...(&gt;Fb)<br/>&gt;   461 &amp;  7/13  #~F...(#~E#)<br/>&gt;   553 &amp; 11/13  #F#<br/>&gt;   646 &amp;  2/13  bGb<br/>&gt;   738 &amp;  6/13  b~G<br/>&gt;   830 &amp; 10/13  &lt;Ab...(&lt;G#)<br/>&gt;   923 &amp;  1/13  &lt;~A<br/>&gt;  1015 &amp;  5/13  -Bb...(-A#)<br/>&gt;  1107 &amp;  9/13  -~B...(-~Cb)<br/>&gt;  1200          C/B#<br/>&gt;</p><p>I had always seen cents with decimal places rather than<br/>fractions, and upon encountering this for the first time,<br/>I noticed right away that something very interesting was<br/>going on here...</p><p>So there&apos;s no &quot;magic&quot; to it.  If you divide 1200 cents<br/>by 13 (for example), each part is going to carry a multiple<br/>of 1/13th of a cent until when you get to the last note,<br/>you have 13/13ths which adds a whole extra cent to bring<br/>you to the &quot;octave&quot;.</p><p>&gt;<br/>&gt; And how does this all relate to &quot;cents&quot; again??<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Sorry to be so mystified... and this isn&apos;t even the MATH<br/>&gt; list, which is not heartening...</p><p>I repeated above both cents-values for the two types of moria.</p><p>If you think that your maximum 72-EDO error of (16 &amp; 2/3) / 2<br/>=  8 &amp; 1/3 cents is small enough to disregard, then you can<br/>simply forget about the fractions in my tables and round to<br/>the nearest 72-EDO degree.  If 8+ cents won&apos;t bother you<br/>(which it really probably won&apos;t since we&apos;re approximating<br/>other EDOs here, and not easier-to-hear-out-of-tune JI),<br/>you can ignore the fractions and round up or down.</p><p>I only included the fractions to show where the inconsistencies<br/>occur.  By keeping track of the amount of error as you go<br/>along, you might be able to find advantageous places to<br/>hide the commatic shifts.  And to my eyes it&apos;s much easier<br/>to keep track of the error when that error is expressed<br/>in a simple system of fractions that can be easily added.</p><p>One reason why 72 is such an important number thru-out<br/>history (kabalah, numerology, gematria, etc. ... see the<br/>spiritual_tuning list for recent posts on this stuff)<br/>is because, like 60 and 12, it&apos;s very easy to divide a<br/>number of different ways.</p><p>This easy divisibility is a big part of the reason why<br/>the 72-EDO notation is so compact.  Lower levels of<br/>cardinality are easily expressed by a single symbol.<br/>Part of the problem with notating such &quot;good&quot; EDO divisions<br/>as 29, 31, 41, and 53 is that they are all prime numbers<br/>and therefore not amenable to such subdivision.</p><p>-monz<br/><a href="http://www.monz.org">http://www.monz.org</a><br/>&quot;All roads lead to n^0&quot;</p></div><h3><a id=24330 href="#24330">ðŸ”—</a>jpehrson@rcn.com</h3><span>6/3/2001 5:08:27 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In tuning@y..., &quot;monz&quot; &lt;joemonz@y...&gt; wrote:</p><p><a href="/tuning/topicId_24270.html#24326">/tuning/topicId_24270.html#24326</a></p><p>Thank you very much, Monz, for your explanation of the &quot;moria...&quot;</p><p>It does seem to be a &quot;convenient&quot; description for one degree of 72.<br/>It&apos;s interesting that it has such a close historical approximation as<br/>well.
