They just<br/>released another video of the other prototype up in Toronto that was much<br/>better maintained. This might be a useful data point to help answer<br/>people&apos;s questions about what the keyboard is like IRL. You can find it<br/>here (skip to 3:41 for the playing):<br/><a href="http://www.indiegogo.com/projects/terpstra-keyboard-280-color-changing-continuous-controllers">http://www.indiegogo.com/projects/terpstra-keyboard-280-color-changing-continuous-controllers</a></p><p>This was definitely a higher-quality video than mine. I still like the<br/>videos Tyler and I shot too, but as far as a demonstration of actually<br/>playing on it goes, this is definitely a way higher quality representation<br/>of that. Seems like they filmed this in a studio running Kontakt - in<br/>contrast, mine was shot on my iPhone, with the thing hooked up to a really<br/>quick Max/MSP patch coming out of a tiny speaker attached to a computer<br/>other side of the room... running Windows Me... lol.</p><p>He has it hooked up to a nice piano patch in Kontakt, so you can hear it&apos;s<br/>very velocity sensitive. Actually, I&apos;m really happy to hear how nice the<br/>dynamics sound - I set mine up with an organ patch and didn&apos;t think much of<br/>it, but there&apos;s definitely a lot of piano in my future once I get my hands<br/>on this thing :)</p><p>The other thing has to do with key action, which you can hear is much<br/>softer overall than in my video. Garnet&apos;s video basically comes off to me<br/>like how it sounded in the room when I was playing it, which hopefully<br/>helps everyone judge how the keyboard sounds IRL. It isn&apos;t like it&apos;s<br/>completely inaudible or anything, and maybe that still bothers some people,<br/>but truth be told, when we were playing it it didn&apos;t really sound different<br/>from any other standard MIDI controller keybed action, maybe with a bit<br/>less &quot;lows&quot; or something.</p><p>Anyway, I&apos;m glad that they came out with the video, and I&apos;m even more set<br/>on it now :) You can find the campaign here (<br/><a href="http://www.indiegogo.com/projects/terpstra-keyboard-280-color-changing-continuous-controllers">http://www.indiegogo.com/projects/terpstra-keyboard-280-color-changing-continuous-controllers</a><br/>).</p><p>And again, I&apos;m not affiliated with the campaign or anything, just my<br/>personal opinion, but now Dylan&apos;s on diykeyboard, so you can ask him<br/>questions directly too :)</p><p>Cheers,<br/>Mike</p></div>
