The term appears on page 79<br/>and is followed by a couple of pages of examples.  Even though this<br/>is a book about 31-ET, the numbers in some of the ratios go higher<br/>than you might expect -- up into the 20&apos;s in places.</p><p>The translation was done by Leigh Gerdine (from German, I believe),<br/>so &quot;isoharmonic&quot; is evidently the translator&apos;s term.  I don&apos;t know<br/>what German and Dutch terms Fokker used, so I have no idea whether<br/>this is a transliteration.</p><p>--George</p></div>
