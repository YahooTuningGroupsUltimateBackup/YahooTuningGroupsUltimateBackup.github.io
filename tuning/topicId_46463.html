Like i have said, i do not claim to<br/>have an an exceptional ear, but i do recognize when things sound different. And remember i started in ET and it was<br/>the siound that made me disregard my 31 tone instruments. This is not like changing a few dials on a a machine, it is<br/>boxing up things that took alot of hard labor to get. The biggest Psychological effect i can think of is having to<br/>build one tuning, knowing you are going to be stucxk with it for years, posibly it takes this type of &apos;pressure&apos; to<br/>really hone it what you want.</p><p><a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a> wrote:</p><p>&gt;<br/>&gt;    From: &quot;Joseph Pehrson&quot; &lt;<a href="mailto:jpehrson@rcn.com">jpehrson@rcn.com</a>&gt;<br/>&gt; Subject: Re: 665-tone equal temperament?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; --- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, &lt;monz@a...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; <a href="/tuning/topicId_46045.html#46105">/tuning/topicId_46045.html#46105</a><br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; ... altho, of course, Kraig has some reservations about it.<br/>&gt; &gt; and to an extent i agree with him.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; in my own listening experiments, and also when listening<br/>&gt; &gt; to La Monte Young&apos;s music live at the Dream House, i often<br/>&gt; &gt; swear that i can hear differences in tuning that i&apos;m<br/>&gt; &gt; theoretically &quot;not supposed&quot; to be able to hear because<br/>&gt; &gt; the tiny differences in pitch are so small.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; i speculate that perhaps this is attributable to my<br/>&gt; &gt; being able to *feel* the difference in vibrations<br/>&gt; &gt; rather than perceive them audibly via the ear/brain.<br/>&gt; &gt; but more research is needed to follow-up on that,<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; and that&apos;s fine, because i means that i&apos;m required<br/>&gt; &gt; to listen to more microtonal music!  ;-)<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; -monz<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; ***Just to be a devilish devil&apos;s disciple:  is it possible that in<br/>&gt; music there is a &quot;placibo&quot; effect.  Or, in other words, one&apos;s<br/>&gt; *psychology* makes one *believe* one is hearing something, or hearing<br/>&gt; a difference that is mostly just in the imagination??<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; J.
