Both of your responses show<br/>how dialogue of this kind, made possible by the Tuning List, can<br/>indeed cause an author such as myself to change her views, or at least<br/>to &quot;refine&quot; their expression in a way which may amount to the same<br/>thing.</p><p>Before responding to these two replies, I would like briefly to<br/>acknowledge other replies centering around the music of Charles Ives,<br/>a topic I was incautious enough to write about without actually<br/>knowing the music. Of course, it might be argued that my indiscretion<br/>at least had the effect of prompting thoughtful and often poetic<br/>responses from Johnny Reinhard and Dan Stearns alike. In another<br/>article, I may venture a few comments.</p><p>Having taken up some considerable length in my original post, I shall<br/>attempt to define here more concisely, with the benefit of much help<br/>from Daniel Wolf and John deLaubenfels, two new and hopefully better<br/>concepts: &quot;just realization,&quot; and &quot;Xeno-Just realization.&quot;</p><p>------------------<br/>1. For Daniel Wolf<br/>------------------</p><p>Turning first to Daniel Wolf&apos;s reply, I would like warmly to agree<br/>with what I realize are words of good counsel:</p><p>&gt; Isn&apos;t it more useful to define the tuning independently of the<br/>&gt; compositional technique and then to analyse the way in which<br/>&gt; individual repertoires, composers or compositions project (or fail<br/>&gt; to project) aspects of that tuning?</p><p>Upon reading these words, I realized that in my article I was mixing<br/>two issues which in fact it should have been my goal to differentiate:<br/>whether a tuning is &quot;JI,&quot; and whether it has enough pure ratios<br/>&quot;justly&quot; to represent the intervals called for by a given music.</p><p>Very specifically, what I was seeking to address in my definition is<br/>the kind of viewpoint which assumes that a &quot;true JI&quot; system must have<br/>certain specific ratios available such as a 5:4 major third (excluding<br/>a 3-limit system), or a 7:4 minor seventh (excluding also a 5-limit<br/>system). My solution at first blush was to propose that these<br/>lower-prime-limit systems are &quot;JI&quot; if and only if they are used for<br/>music which can be &quot;justly&quot; realized within their limits.</p><p>However, I now realize in a way that my definition does deliberately<br/>the same questionable thing that others may be doing unintentionally:<br/>mixing the issue of whether a system is JI, and whether or in what<br/>manner it fits a given compositional or improvisational style.</p><p>Therefore I would like to propose _two_ definitions, one of a &quot;just<br/>intonation system,&quot; and the other of the &quot;just realization&quot; of a given<br/>composition or style.</p><p>First, here is my new definition of a &quot;classic JI system,&quot; with much<br/>indebtedness to your point about not necessarily requiring a<br/>&quot;complete&quot; set of ratios up to some odd limit:</p><p>             A tuning system is a classic just intonation system<br/>             if:</p><p>             (1) All intervals in the system are defined as<br/>                 integer ratios;</p><p>             (2) The system provides some set of intervals<br/>                 other than the unison and octave based on<br/>                 low-integer ratios.</p><p>As you point out, a definition of JI should not exclude a system such<br/>as that of La Monte Young because it may have 7-based but not 5-based<br/>ratios, for example.</p><p>Letting these two objective criteria suffice to define a system as<br/>&quot;JI,&quot; I would propose a concept of &quot;just realization&quot; (JR):</p><p>                  A JI system provides just realization for<br/>                  a given musical composition or style if:</p><p>                  (1) For music based on a contrast between<br/>                      stable and unstable intervals, as in<br/>                      historical modal or tonal Western<br/>                      European polyphony, the system provides<br/>                      pure ratios for all stable concords; or</p><p>                  (2) For other musics, it provides a set of<br/>                      pure ratios sufficient to represent the<br/>                      intended interval structure of the<br/>                      composition or style.</p><p>This may, as you point out, allow for musics where concepts such as<br/>&quot;stable concords&quot; (implying a contrast with unstable sonorities) may<br/>not apply. If Harry Partch&apos;s JI system provides the set of pure<br/>intervals called for by his music, we have JR, regardless of whether<br/>such concepts as &quot;concord/discord&quot; apply.</p><p>To sum up: I would say that a 3-limit tuning is always JI, and is JR<br/>for Perotin or Machaut, but not for Palestrina or Bach. The systems of<br/>La Monte Young and Harry Partch are likewise always JI, and are JR for<br/>their respective musics, or for other similar styles.</p><p>------------------------<br/>2. For John deLaubenfels<br/>------------------------</p><p>Please let me quote some of the most gracious words I have seen on<br/>this Tuning List:</p><p>&gt; Margo, you may be the least combative member on this list (not<br/>&gt; counting, I suppose, those who don&apos;t post at all!), but I feel<br/>&gt; compelled to respond.</p><p>Here, as a pioneer in the area of adaptive tuning, you were replying<br/>to my comment that</p><p>&gt;&gt; [...] JI musicians and advocates may differ not only in their<br/>&gt;&gt; choice of odd-limits and musical styles, but in their preferences<br/>&gt;&gt; regarding levels of contrast between concords, dual-purpose<br/>&gt;&gt; sonorities, and discords. Such varying tastes lend emphasis to<br/>&gt;&gt; the point that an ideal JI system for one kind of music may do<br/>&gt;&gt; great intonational injustice to another.</p><p>While this statement _could_ be read narrowly to address only what I<br/>would call the issue of &quot;underrealization,&quot; for example using a<br/>3-limit JI tuning for 5-limit music, it could equally well be read to<br/>describe using 7-limit JI for historical music generally associated<br/>with a 5-limit outlook as a &quot;great intonational injustice.&quot; The fact<br/>that I chose to leave the second reading open reflected my real<br/>ambivalence at the time about such adaptive tunings, not an<br/>unintentional slip or a misunderstanding.</p><p>For this I take full responsibility, but am pleased to say that your<br/>gentle and friendly response -- under the circumstances, showing more<br/>restraint than I&apos;ve ever had cause to exercise here myself -- has<br/>caused me to reconsider my own feelings and remember the experimental<br/>side of my own musical roots. As a result, I am pleased both to defend<br/>adaptive tuning and to suggest a new term for it: Xeno-JI (XJI), or<br/>more maybe more formally, &quot;superjust representation&quot; (SJR).</p><p>At the start, I should emphasize the importance of affirming the value<br/>of historical and &quot;period-appropriate&quot; tunings in an _inclusive_ way.<br/>To say that &quot;the 81:64 major third of 3-limit in Machaut and the 9:5<br/>minor seventh in Monteverdi are musically to be valued&quot; need not and<br/>_should not_ be taken to imply, &quot;any other tuning of these intervals<br/>in a performance is an act or artistic injustice.&quot;</p><p>Rather, as you say, to &quot;distort&quot; a piece in a pleasing manner is not<br/>artistic injustice, but artistic variety. Of course, I would urge that<br/>we _also_ cherish and relish more likely historical intonations for<br/>the piece, thus more deeply appreciating both types of interpretations.</p><p>Maybe I have a special responsibility to point out that my own<br/>approaches are hardly pure and always &quot;historically authentic.&quot;</p><p>First, someone could ask, &quot;Is a Yamaha TX-802 really an authentic<br/>medieval or Renaissance instrument?&quot; This is indeed the instrument I<br/>use for my explorations of the tunings I discuss here.</p><p>Even some of my &quot;period tuning&quot; experiments involve an artistic guess:<br/>for example, my approach to early 15th-century music of using<br/>Pythagorean thirds and sixths as cadential intervals resolving for<br/>example to fifths and octaves, but schisma thirds and sixths for<br/>prolonged noncadential sonorities involving sharps. This is a &quot;guess,&quot;<br/>maybe a kind of historical novel with some footnotes. I further<br/>confess to trying (and liking) an interpretation with a comma<br/>inflection</p><p>E4  F#4 G4<br/>Db4 C#4 D4<br/>A3      G3</p><p>to have it both ways, a beguilingly smooth diminished fourth between<br/>the lower voices for the opening sonority and then an active major<br/>third (along with the major sixth) for a classic Gothic cadence with<br/>the usual verve and energy. This is a &quot;distortion&quot; -- however artful<br/>or otherwise -- at least as far from likely period practice as doing<br/>Bach in 7-limit.</p><p>Further, while more than ready to defend 16:9 and 9:5 as realizations<br/>of the minor seventh, I must admit to devising a &quot;Xeno-Gothic&quot; tuning<br/>(24-note Pythagorean or 3-limit JI) using minor sevenths a Pythagorean<br/>comma smaller than 16:9 -- about 3.8 cents from 7:4 -- for sonorities<br/>resolving to fifths. Yes, I can quote Marchettus of Padua to provide a<br/>_possible_ basis for this experiment -- but then again, you might<br/>quote certain 18th-century theorists on the &quot;harmonic seventh&quot; to<br/>justify the use of 7:4 in music of that era.</p><p>Then, again, I confess to trying a Monteverdian sonority of minor<br/>seventh and fifth above the bass, but using an augmented sixth -- and<br/>finding the standard resolution intriguing in this tuning. Yes, I did<br/>it using a near-7:4 interval in 1/4-comma meantone (a la Dave Hill) --<br/>but I enjoyed it while knowing very well that a regular minor seventh<br/>would be the expected choice.</p><p>Having made my due confessions for the moment, I would propose that we<br/>define &quot;superjust realization&quot; (SJR) as the application of a JI system<br/>to a piece so as to use simpler or more pure ratios for some intervals<br/>than a likely period-specific tuning would involve. Your 7-limit<br/>interpretations of 18th-19th century music may fit this category, and<br/>I also like the term &quot;Xeno-Just realization&quot; (or XJR).</p><p>Your reply raises some fascinating issues about technical and musical<br/>factors shaping intonational choices, historical or otherwise, but for<br/>now I would like warmly to thank you for the reply you felt compelled<br/>to write, and wrote so compellingly as well as graciously.</p><p>Most appreciatively,</p><p>Margo Schulter<br/><a href="mailto:mschulter@value.net">mschulter@value.net</a></p></div>
