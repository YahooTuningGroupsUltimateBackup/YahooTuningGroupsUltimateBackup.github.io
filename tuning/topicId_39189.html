Higher harmonics are #s or bs or white-key notes<br/>slightly above or below the ones I listed. So by nature the octave has 7<br/>diatonic notes.

Then, a friend of<br/>mine who is a professional singer, with fifteen albums to his credit,<br/>with a perfect-pitch tenor voice asked my wife and I to manage his<br/>horse farm in Nova Scotia while he cut an album for several months at<br/>Warner Bros. in California.  While there and the snows flew I played<br/>with the piano, and taught myself chords and octaves and with both<br/>hands could play music for an hour to the point that when he came<br/>back, he sat down and listened for a half hour and praised my<br/>&quot;natural&quot; ear, etc.</p><p>Question one: what is a &quot;natural&quot; ear?  Why do I think I can tell<br/>perfect pitch?  Why do I say, as he does, that so-in-so cannot carry<br/>a tune in a bucket, and their voice is flat?  Does this all mean I am<br/>born with something?  Or did it develop when I listened to my<br/>daughter during years taking formal training and playing it around<br/>me?</p><p>Question two: what is &quot;natural&quot; sound in music?  Why is it that there<br/>are different scales for different folk around the world?  Why is<br/>something &quot;natural&quot; to us, not &quot;natural&quot; to them?  Is there something<br/>in a culture which predetermines our disposition toward certain<br/>scales? Or should I ask, toward certain tuning?  Or is it different<br/>systems of music?  Or, are these various systems merely offspring of<br/>a system of sounds natural to Nature?</p><p>Question three: Why is &quot;Do, Re, Me, Fa, So, La, Te, Do&quot; taught to<br/>really young music students?  Why do they emphasize, three times,<br/>&quot;Me, Me, Me&quot;?  Is that Middle C?  Is that the &quot;tuning&quot; center point<br/>of our musical scale?  Is that &quot;tuning&quot; center, the piano?  Does a<br/>piano get tuned first, then the Orchestra tune to that instrument?<br/>And why? Or why not?</p><p>Question four: What is the starting point, I guess you all would say,<br/>note on a piano?  Either where it all began, or a tuner begins?  Does<br/>the scale or system begin at Middle C, or some other note?  And if<br/>so, does the system progress from some Zero point and progress<br/>infinitely, technically, through the range of the human ear?  Or does<br/>the system start in the middle, at Middle C, and move down through<br/>the lower notes, and move up through the upper notes, away from some<br/>starting point in the middle?</p><p>Thank you, but as a student of music, these simple points have never<br/>been laid out for me in anything I have ever read about music.</p><p>Lastly, down the road, I believe it will help me understand the<br/>celestial music I think inherent in Nature.  Maybe, musicians do not<br/>agree that mathematics is the essence of nature and Nature as I do.<br/>So, I think we can get there from here, and tuning seems to be the<br/>key, at least to my way of think right now.  Correct me, if you think<br/>I am wrong.

Also, what would it take for a &quot;pianist&quot; to relearn the new keyboard layout. It might be possible, today, to create a frame capabile of withstanding that pressure, but what about during the days of the advent of the piano?

How<br/>&gt;much tention is generated by a set of strings on the frame of the<br/>&gt;piano?</p><p>Lots.  The exact figure is on Steinway&apos;s site, in tons.</p><p>&gt;Is it possible to add another 7 notes per octave (this would come<br/>&gt;to a total of 21 strings per octave in the upper registers, adding<br/>&gt;approximately 115 strings to the piano).</p><p>Yes, it is possible.</p><p>&gt;Also, what would it take for a &quot;pianist&quot; to relearn the new<br/>&gt;keyboard layout.</p><p>Lots and lots of work.  So hard, that it&apos;s nearly impossible for<br/>an individual working in a vacuum.  The support of a community<br/>really helps.  Unfortunately, very few on this list have any<br/>interest in it!</p><p>&gt;It might be possible, today, to create a frame capabile of<br/>&gt;withstanding that pressure,</p><p>It is.</p><p>&gt;but what about during the days of the advent of the piano?<br/>&gt;(Did not some instrument designer create a 19 note per octave<br/>&gt;piano sometime around 1600-1700???)</p><p>Early pianos, today called fortepianos, were strung with much less<br/>tension than modern instruments.  Legend has it that B. invented<br/>the first iron-frame piano for Liszt, so he could not break the<br/>frame during his famed improvisation-concerts!</p><p>&gt;At the same time, the organ came first, so why did it only have<br/>&gt;12 notes per octave, I would imagine the practical &quot;excuse&quot; was<br/>&gt;that 7 more pipes per octave was either not needed, or did it<br/>&gt;cost too much.</p><p>That might have made experimentation difficult, but keep in mind<br/>that organs already have many pipes per pitch.  Organ builders<br/>could have easily reduced the number of stops a bit in favor of a<br/>microtonal scale.  The real answer is that the 12-tone system was<br/>already very entrenched before anybody thought to ask where it<br/>came from.  It happens a lot in bottom-up evolution.</p><p>-Carl</p></div><h3><a id=39270 href="#39270">ðŸ”—</a>Bill Arnold &#x3C;billarnoldfla@yahoo.com&#x3E;</h3><span>10/6/2002 9:34:46 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>My remarks will come at the end of the thoughtful response of Joe<br/>Monz:</p><p>I, Bill Arnold, had written:</p><p>Can someone explain why a piano centers (I think) on Middle C?

How many C notes could you actually have on a piano that<br/>the<br/>&gt; human ear could hear if the keyboard could be infinite? Why are<br/>there<br/>&gt; not more?</p><p>i&apos;m perhaps not really answering any of your specific questions<br/>here, but you&apos;ll probably find this useful:</p><p>in the original paper i put online about my tuning theories<br/>(&lt;<a href="http://makeashorterlink.com/?M6C022302">http://makeashorterlink.com/?M6C022302</a>&gt; -- wait a moment<br/>for the redirected link to work), there&apos;s a section discussing<br/>a &quot;reference pitch&quot;, which i call &quot;C n^0&quot; and suggest as<br/>referring to either 1 Hz or 256 (= 2^8) Hz.</p><p>since my notation is based on prime-factoring, this makes<br/>&quot;middle-C&quot; either 2^8 in the former case or n^0 in the latter.</p><p>i also state here: &quot;The approximate range of human hearing is<br/>from 20 to 20,000 Hz. Described as powers of 2, this is roughly<br/>2^4 (=16) to 2^14 (= 16,384) Hz.&quot;  if &quot;middle C&quot; at 256 Hz is<br/>C n^0, this range is described as 2^(-4...+6).</p><p>they are &quot;harmonics&quot; of each other because they are all<br/>powers of 2, and by definition, the interval which most<br/>scales set up as the &quot;interval of equivalence&quot; is one whose<br/>bounding pitches have the frequency ratio of 2:1.</p><p>this ratio usually goes by the more familiar musical name<br/>of &quot;octave&quot; (abbreviated &quot;8ve&quot;), which is Latin for &quot;eighth&quot;.</p><p>during the medieval period, the standard scale in use was the<br/>heptatonic diatonic scale -- that is, 7 different pitches<br/>(&quot;heptatonic&quot; = &quot;7-tone&quot;) within one &quot;8ve&quot;, assumed to repeat<br/>exactly in all other &quot;8ves&quot;, and which have a mixture of both<br/>&quot;half-steps&quot; and &quot;whole-steps&quot; as the intervals between the<br/>degrees of the scale.</p><p>(&quot;diatonic&quot; is Greek for &quot;thru tones&quot;, because of the three<br/>basic _genera_ in ancient Greek theory, this was the one<br/>which had 2 tones in each &quot;tetrachord&quot;; the other two _genera_<br/>had an interval which was bigger and two which were smaller.<br/>see my &quot;Tutorial on ancient Greek tetrachord-theory&quot;<br/>&lt;<a href="http://makeashorterlink.com/?X65121302">http://makeashorterlink.com/?X65121302</a>&gt; for more info.)</p><p>when listening to a scale such as this, one is immediately<br/>struck by how similar the 8th note (doesn&apos;t matter if it&apos;s<br/>the 8th note below or the 8th note above the starting pitch)<br/>sounds like the starting note.</p><p>thus, the &quot;8ve&quot; became the most basic interval involved in<br/>scale construction as well as harmonic usage and analysis.</p><p>i suggest you peruse the following definitions from my<br/>Tuning Dictionary:</p><p><a href="http://groups.yahoo.com/group/monz/files/dict/harm.htm">http://groups.yahoo.com/group/monz/files/dict/harm.htm</a><br/><a href="http://groups.yahoo.com/group/monz/files/dict/harmser.htm">http://groups.yahoo.com/group/monz/files/dict/harmser.htm</a><br/><a href="http://groups.yahoo.com/group/monz/files/dict/equivalenceinterval.htm">http://groups.yahoo.com/group/monz/files/dict/equivalenceinterval.htm</a><br/><a href="http://groups.yahoo.com/group/monz/files/dict/octave.htm">http://groups.yahoo.com/group/monz/files/dict/octave.htm</a><br/><a href="http://groups.yahoo.com/group/monz/files/dict/diatonic.htm">http://groups.yahoo.com/group/monz/files/dict/diatonic.htm</a><br/><a href="http://groups.yahoo.com/group/monz/files/dict/tetrachd.htm">http://groups.yahoo.com/group/monz/files/dict/tetrachd.htm</a><br/><a href="http://groups.yahoo.com/group/monz/files/dict/semi.htm">http://groups.yahoo.com/group/monz/files/dict/semi.htm</a><br/><a href="http://groups.yahoo.com/group/monz/files/dict/wholetone.htm">http://groups.yahoo.com/group/monz/files/dict/wholetone.htm</a><br/><a href="http://groups.yahoo.com/group/monz/files/dict/degree.htm">http://groups.yahoo.com/group/monz/files/dict/degree.htm</a></p><p>later (c. 1200s to 1300s), mainly thru the process of &quot;mutation&quot;,<br/>the scale resources expanded to include what we would now call<br/>the &quot;flats&quot; and &quot;sharps&quot;, eventually leading to the &quot;chromatic&quot;<br/>scale.</p><p>during the early development of Western music, from its origins<br/>in the Frankish kingdom c. 700 up to the recognition of &quot;3rds&quot;<br/>and &quot;6ths&quot; as &quot;consonances&quot; c. 1500, the &quot;Pythagorean&quot; (3-limit)<br/>scale was the basic tuning.</p><p>after 1500, 5-limit &quot;just-intonation&quot; became a theoretical<br/>paradigm but proved difficult to achieve in practice, leading<br/>to the idea of &quot;temperament&quot;.  in roughly chronological order,<br/>the leading families of temperaments have been &quot;meantone&quot;,<br/>&quot;well-temperament&quot;, and then &quot;equal-temperament&quot;.</p><p>for a long time it has been recognized that 12 different pitches<br/>could form a nearly-closed circle, and by tempering, it could<br/>become an actual closed circle.  thus during the 1900s the<br/>tuning standard became &quot;12-tone equal-temperament&quot;, so that<br/>the 2:1 ratio or &quot;8ve&quot; now contained 12 different notes, each<br/>one spaced the same distance from those adjacent to it.</p><p>more definitions:</p><p><a href="http://groups.yahoo.com/group/monz/files/dict/mutation.htm">http://groups.yahoo.com/group/monz/files/dict/mutation.htm</a><br/><a href="http://groups.yahoo.com/group/monz/files/dict/chromati.htm">http://groups.yahoo.com/group/monz/files/dict/chromati.htm</a><br/><a href="http://groups.yahoo.com/group/monz/files/dict/major3rd.htm">http://groups.yahoo.com/group/monz/files/dict/major3rd.htm</a><br/><a href="http://groups.yahoo.com/group/monz/files/dict/minor3rd.htm">http://groups.yahoo.com/group/monz/files/dict/minor3rd.htm</a><br/><a href="http://groups.yahoo.com/group/monz/files/dict/consonance.htm">http://groups.yahoo.com/group/monz/files/dict/consonance.htm</a><br/><a href="http://groups.yahoo.com/group/monz/files/dict/pythag.htm">http://groups.yahoo.com/group/monz/files/dict/pythag.htm</a><br/><a href="http://groups.yahoo.com/group/monz/files/dict/limit.htm">http://groups.yahoo.com/group/monz/files/dict/limit.htm</a><br/><a href="http://groups.yahoo.com/group/monz/files/dict/just.htm">http://groups.yahoo.com/group/monz/files/dict/just.htm</a><br/><a href="http://groups.yahoo.com/group/monz/files/dict/temp.htm">http://groups.yahoo.com/group/monz/files/dict/temp.htm</a><br/><a href="http://groups.yahoo.com/group/monz/files/dict/meantone.htm">http://groups.yahoo.com/group/monz/files/dict/meantone.htm</a><br/><a href="http://groups.yahoo.com/group/monz/files/dict/well.htm">http://groups.yahoo.com/group/monz/files/dict/well.htm</a><br/><a href="http://groups.yahoo.com/group/monz/files/dict/eqtemp.htm">http://groups.yahoo.com/group/monz/files/dict/eqtemp.htm</a></p><p>the real question about the range of the piano keyboard<br/>(a real piano has 88 keys, or a range of about 7&amp;1/2 &quot;8ves&quot;)<br/>is not &quot;why aren&apos;t there more notes?&quot;, but rather &quot;why are<br/>there that many?&quot;.  the notes at either end of the keyboard<br/>are so low or high that their pitch can barely be discerned,<br/>and they&apos;re usually used only in combination with like notes<br/>an &quot;8ve&quot;

and after several years, I<br/>could say, &quot;Play Bach,&quot; and she would tease my wife and I with<br/>Schumann, and I would yell back &quot;That&apos;s not Bach;&quot; and still, I did<br/>not know all the notes, and scales, and whatever.  Then, a friend of<br/>mine who is a professional singer, with fifteen albums to his credit,<br/>with a perfect-pitch tenor voice asked my wife and I to manage his<br/>horse farm in Nova Scotia while he cut an album for several months at<br/>Warner Bros. in California.  While there and the snows flew I played<br/>with the piano, and taught myself chords and octaves and with both<br/>hands could play music for an hour to the point that when he came<br/>back, he sat down and listened for a half hour and praised my<br/>&quot;natural&quot; ear, etc.</p><p>Question one: what is a &quot;natural&quot; ear?  Why do I think I can tell<br/>perfect pitch?  Why do I say, as he does, that so-in-so cannot carry<br/>a tune in a bucket, and their voice is flat?  Does this all mean I am<br/>born with something?  Or did it develop when I listened to my<br/>daughter during years taking formal training and playing it around<br/>me?</p><p>Question two: what is &quot;natural&quot; sound in music?  Why is it that there<br/>are different scales for different folk around the world?  Why is<br/>something &quot;natural&quot; to us, not &quot;natural&quot; to them?  Is there something<br/>in a culture which predetermines our disposition toward certain<br/>scales? Or should I ask, toward certain tuning?  Or is it different<br/>systems of music?  Or, are these various systems merely offspring of<br/>a system of sounds natural to Nature?</p><p>Question three: Why is &quot;Do, Re, Me, Fa, So, La, Te, Do&quot; taught to<br/>really young music students?  Why do they emphasize, three times,<br/>&quot;Me, Me, Me&quot;?  Is that Middle C?  Is that the &quot;tuning&quot; center point<br/>of our musical scale?  Is that &quot;tuning&quot; center, the piano?  Does a<br/>piano get tuned first, then the Orchestra tune to that instrument?<br/>And why? Or why not?</p><p>Question four: What is the starting point, I guess you all would say,<br/>note on a piano?  Either where it all began, or a tuner begins?  Does<br/>the scale or system begin at Middle C, or some other note?  And if<br/>so, does the system progress from some Zero point and progress<br/>infinitely, technically, through the range of the human ear?  Or does<br/>the system start in the middle, at Middle C, and move down through<br/>the lower notes, and move up through the upper notes, away from some<br/>starting point in the middle?</p><p>Question five: If Middle C is 256 Hz<br/>[you wrote: &quot;there&apos;s a section discussing<br/>a &quot;reference pitch&quot;, which i call &quot;C n^0&quot; and suggest as<br/>referring to either 1 Hz or 256 (= 2^8) Hz.&quot;<br/>Can you tell me how many zeros that is after the 256?]</p><p>Also, now, I do know that 256 is:<br/>2X1=2 [is this the first octave?of the base note? is that note below<br/>the range of the human ear? is it a vibration like thunder?]</p><p>2x2=4 [is this the second octave?]<br/>4X2=8 [is this the third octave?]<br/>8X2=16 [is this the fourth octave?]<br/>16X2=32 [is this the five octave?]<br/>32X2=64 [is this the sixth octave?]<br/>64X2=128 [is this the seventh octave?]<br/>128X2=256 [is this the eighth octave?  And is it Middle C?<br/>is that why it is called 2^8 and &quot;the eighth&quot;?<br/>Are we now on the same page, mentally in agreement?]</p><p>Thank you, but as a student of music, these simple points have never<br/>been laid out for me in anything I have ever read about music.</p><p>Lastly, down the road, I believe it will help me understand the<br/>celestial music I think inherent in Nature.  Maybe, musicians do not<br/>agree that mathematics is the essence of nature and Nature as I do.<br/>So, I think we can get there from here, and tuning seems to be the<br/>key, at least to my way of think right now.  Correct me, if you think<br/>I am wrong.

Why do I think I can tell<br/>&gt; perfect pitch?  Why do I say, as he does, that so-in-so cannot carry<br/>&gt; a tune in a bucket, and their voice is flat?  Does this all mean I<br/>am<br/>&gt; born with something?  Or did it develop when I listened to my<br/>&gt; daughter during years taking formal training and playing it around<br/>&gt; me?<br/>&gt;</p><p>***Well, quite simply certain people have &quot;perfect pitch&quot;<br/>or &quot;absolute pitch&quot; and others develop a fine sense of &quot;relative<br/>pitch&quot; through practice.  &quot;Perfect pitch&quot; is a special gift that lets<br/>one recognize a certain frequency with a specific name.  However,<br/>it&apos;s not necessarily a *musical* gift.  Some people who are not<br/>musicians at all have that ability, and some *musicians* who have it<br/>regard it as a curse... particularly if they want to study &quot;alternate<br/>tunings!&quot;</p><p>&gt; Question two: what is &quot;natural&quot; sound in music?  Why is it that<br/>there are different scales for different folk around the world?  Why<br/>is something &quot;natural&quot; to us, not &quot;natural&quot; to them?  Is there<br/>something<br/>&gt; in a culture which predetermines our disposition toward certain<br/>&gt; scales? Or should I ask, toward certain tuning?  Or is it different<br/>&gt; systems of music?  Or, are these various systems merely offspring of<br/>&gt; a system of sounds natural to Nature?<br/>&gt;</p><p>***Well, this has been discussed a *lot* on this forum, and you can<br/>find more in the archives.  Paul Erlich has pointed to a lot of<br/>studies that show the preeminence of the OCTAVE or 2:1 ratio as<br/>a &quot;special recognition.&quot; Terhardt:</p><p><a href="http://www.mmk.ei.tum.de/persons/ter.html">http://www.mmk.ei.tum.de/persons/ter.html</a></p><p>The fifth 3:2 is not far behind in terms of &quot;special significance&quot;<br/>since it is the *next* overtone after the 2:1 in the vibrational<br/>series.</p><p>So, in that sense, the 2:1 and 3:2 are &quot;natural&quot; builders or<br/>foundations of music.  Reconciling these two ratios in music has<br/>*much* to do with the *entire* study of tuning and temperament!!!</p><p>If you string 5 ratios of 3:2 together in a chain you get a<br/>PENTATONIC scale, a basic scale that is seen all over in the world.<br/>So, in that sense, there are certain &quot;natural&quot; scalar developments.</p><p>[Sorry to bore the &quot;ole time tuners&quot; with this basic stuff...]</p><p>&gt; Question three: Why is &quot;Do, Re, Me, Fa, So, La, Te, Do&quot; taught to<br/>&gt; really young music students?</p><p>***This solfege system was invented by Guido d&apos;Arezzo and was a<br/>method to teach singing by showing the syllables on a person&apos;s hand!<br/>It was called the &quot;Guidonian Hand...&quot;  (seriously...)</p><p><a href="http://www.stevenestrella.com/composers/composerfiles/guido1050.html">http://www.stevenestrella.com/composers/composerfiles/guido1050.html</a></p><p>Why do they emphasize, three times,<br/>&gt; &quot;Me, Me, Me&quot;?  Is that Middle C?  Is that the &quot;tuning&quot; center point<br/>&gt; of our musical scale?  Is that &quot;tuning&quot; center, the piano?</p><p>***Well, that&apos;s not necessarily true.  Certainly the &quot;Me&quot; was not<br/>emphasized so much in Medieval music, in fact, it was carefully<br/>avoided!  Only later have some done this.  Also, you should be aware<br/>of the fact that many traditional piano tuners start on the &quot;A&quot; below<br/>Middle C.  That&apos;s how I was taught piano tuning at the University of<br/>Michigan.  It was called the &quot;old German method,&quot; presumably invented<br/>by &quot;old Germans...&quot;</p><p>Does a<br/>&gt; piano get tuned first, then the Orchestra tune to that instrument?<br/>&gt; And why? Or why not?<br/>&gt;</p><p>***Pas de tout.  Not at all, not a toot!  The &quot;tooter&quot; is the OBOE,<br/>which has a VERY STABILIZED pitch.  Next time you go to the orchestra<br/>(have you been lately?? :) you will see the OBOE giving the tuning<br/>pitch...</p><p>&gt; Question four: What is the starting point, I guess you all would<br/>say, note on a piano?  Either where it all began, or a tuner begins?</p><p>***See above.  Some start on A, some start on C.  As I have mentioned<br/>previously, if you start on the LOWERMOST C on the piano and play<br/>fifths, you traverse ONLY ONE circle of fifths upon reaching the<br/>highest C.  Surely that&apos;s not just coincidence in the construction of<br/>the instrument.</p><p> Does<br/>&gt; the scale or system begin at Middle C, or some other note?  And if<br/>&gt; so, does the system progress from some Zero point and progress<br/>&gt; infinitely, technically, through the range of the human ear?  Or<br/>does<br/>&gt; the system start in the middle, at Middle C, and move down through<br/>&gt; the lower notes, and move up through the upper notes, away from some<br/>&gt; starting point in the middle?<br/>&gt;</p><p>***I wouldn&apos;t obsess so about a &quot;starting note&quot; if I were you.<br/>Probably music all started with some &quot;singable&quot; note, and I believe<br/>there have been *various* starting pitches since the very earliest<br/>times.  Usually they correspond to the primary notes of various<br/>CLEFS... so that would be *G* for the treble clef, and *F* for the<br/>bass clef.</p><p>Medieval scholars on this list may here show me wrong, but I believe<br/>*F* and *G* were just as important as starting pitches as *C* in the<br/>very earliest music...</p><p>&gt; Thank you, but as a student of music, these simple points have never<br/>&gt; been laid out for me in anything I have ever read about music.<br/>&gt;</p><p>***Simple points are *never* laid out in music teaching, certainly<br/>not in the music schools.  Why would somebody keep paying more and<br/>more money, if it were all shown clearly at the start??? :)</p><p>&gt; Lastly, down the road, I believe it will help me understand the<br/>&gt; celestial music I think inherent in Nature.  Maybe, musicians do not<br/>&gt; agree that mathematics is the essence of nature and Nature as I do.<br/>&gt; So, I think we can get there from here, and tuning seems to be the<br/>&gt; key, at least to my way of think right now.

Middle C is listed as<br/>261.626 Hz. These numbers are only approx.  The tuner that uses less<br/>stretch will have different figures for the extremes.  The piano<br/>scales that produce higher inharmonicity will also &quot;expand&quot; these<br/>figures.

Indeed, before the 1880&apos;s, pianos usually only went<br/>to A7 with the 85 note keyboards.  The Romantic era of music, and<br/>perhaps marketing, caused a shift upwards to finalize the scale at C.<br/>The top note is C because of several reasons. One is that it<br/>approaches the human limits of hearing and physical arm length.<br/>Another is that it add a C# as a final note, since musically, C#<br/>didn&apos;t usually represent an oft-used tonic and ending on a raised key<br/>would have been mechanically awkward).  Another is the point of<br/>diminishing returns,  the string length for C8 is approx. 1 7/8&quot; on<br/>ALL pianos, be they concert grands or spinets, and it becomes<br/>physically difficult to create a shorter scale and still leave room<br/>for soundboard under it as well as finding a way for the hammer to<br/>contact it.  The bottom of the keyboard reached A0 and ended there<br/>because we can&apos;t really hear much under 27 Hz.  The extended<br/>Bosendorfer scales are intended to add tension beyond the last<br/>playable note (A0) in order to improve the response of that string.<br/>(the last string on a bridge often suffers tonal deficincies due to<br/>mechanical reasons).&quot;</p><p>Wonderful explanation.  Thank you.  Now, am I correct in this summary<br/>chart?

Even music *theory* can SOMETIMES be mathematical, but not in<br/>all cases.  I guess you can&apos;t avoid mathematics much in the science<br/>of *acoustics...*</p><p>&gt; Thus, precisely, what is the &quot;lowest C on the piano&quot; and what<br/>is &quot;the very *highest* C on the piano&quot;?  Can you also give their<br/>mathematical equivalencies?  Is not Middle C at 256 Hz?  By the way,<br/>no one has told me yet how many zeroes are after the 256?</p><p>***The lowest C is just that: the lowest C.  Similarly for the<br/>highest.  If you mean *frequency* equivalents in Hertz, look at any<br/>acoustics book like Backus, _Fundamentals of Acoustics_ and they have<br/>the Hertz breakdown for every note of the piano.  I don&apos;t have my<br/>copy with me at the moment...</p><p>&gt;<br/>&gt; How many C&apos;s make up what you call &quot;a circle of fifths&quot;?</p><p>***Really only *one!*  The *next* &quot;C&quot; that one would reach is really<br/>B#!  The difference between these two is the famous &quot;Pythagorean<br/>Comma...&quot;  I suggest you go to Joe Monzo&apos;s informative dictionary if<br/>you want more information on this, Bill:</p><p><a href="http://groups.yahoo.com/group/monz/files/dict/pythcom.htm">http://groups.yahoo.com/group/monz/files/dict/pythcom.htm</a></p><p>Actually, I think the chart of fifths could have been a little<br/>clearer.  Just start at the lowest C on the piano and keep playing<br/>fifths until you get to the top of the piano.  Ummm, first of all, do<br/>you *have* a piano??  That might help.</p><p>However, the very *top* &quot;C&quot; you reach is a B#, a Pythagorean comma<br/>HIGHER from the &quot;octave C&quot; created by repeated multiplication of the<br/>fundamental C frequency by 2x.</p><p>This is why the fifths must be *tempered* by 1/12 of this comma each<br/>time in the circle.</p><p>(Sorry to again bore the ole&apos; tuning readers with this...)</p><p>&gt;<br/>&gt; And, as a novice, I really would like to know why you call it &quot;a<br/>&gt; circle&quot; of notes, and not a sphere or a linear series or a triangle<br/>&gt; or some other &quot;gon&quot;--say a hexagon or other?<br/>&gt;</p><p>***Probably this term came about because the pitches come back around<br/>to the same place, i.e. 7 octaves equals 12 fifths, provided, that<br/>is, the fifths are *tempered.*</p><p>The octave naming scheme is just a *convention*... i.e. C and octave<br/>C are both called &quot;C&quot;, D and octave D are called &quot;D&quot; etc.  This<br/>testifies to the significance of octave equivalence as a perceptual<br/>identifier...  As Gertrude Stein would say:  a D is a D is a D.</p><p>&gt; I am not trying to be facetious, but really wondering why music uses<br/>&gt; the term &quot;circle&quot;?  As a mathematician I would tell you that is<br/>&gt; injecting the concept of pi, or 3.14etc. into the series of notes.<br/>&gt; The reason this is of interest to me, is that Einstein said that all<br/>&gt; space was curved, i.e., partakes of pi, and therefore music must<br/>too?<br/>&gt; Agreed?  And if all space is curved and all music is curved, then it<br/>&gt; seems that the argument for the Music of the Spheres gains from the<br/>&gt; parallel curved structure, does it not?<br/>&gt;</p><p>***I don&apos;t believe the people who coined the term &quot;circle&quot; for the<br/>fifths had pi in mind... sorry to disappoint you...  :)</p><p>Good luck with your investigations.

The<br/>lowest note on a standard (full keyboard) piano is an<br/>&quot;A&quot; that vibrates at 440 cycles per second. The<br/>stantard full key board has 88 keys (11 octaves). A<br/>&quot;spinnet&quot; has 66 keys. There is one exception: The<br/>Bosendorfer (brand) full grand has an extra octave on<br/>the low end. All of the extra keys are black. On the<br/>Bosendorfer, the low A sounds at 220 cycles per<br/>second.</p><p>Working up from the 440 cps &quot;A&quot;, each octave<br/>represents a doubling of the frequency of the previous<br/>&quot;A&quot;. The eight keys of each octive are divided into<br/>half, quarter, and eighths of that octave.   (IN<br/>THEORY!)</p><p>I decided to use a clip-on pick-up, a frequency meter,<br/>and o-scope to do a more perfect (according to<br/>Pythagoras) tuning than some piano tuner could<br/>possably do by ear. When I was done, each key sounded<br/>at precisely the right (theoretical) frequency, but<br/>the piano sounded awfull. Here is the trick. There are<br/>micro harmonics that produce the discordant sounds I<br/>obtained. I called the piano tuner. He tuned each key<br/>(other than the botton A) SLIGHTLY sharper (higher)<br/>than the theoretical frequency. The start of the<br/>second octave was about a half cycle higher. of course<br/>this effect produces a high &quot;C&quot; that is several cycles<br/>higher than the theoretical frequency. He explaned<br/>that it had something to do with &quot;fifths&quot; that don&apos;t<br/>come out even.</p><p>After he tweeked the piano - all was good. The<br/>standard three note chords sounded right.</p><p>I hope this experience is usefull.</p><p>John Kuefel&quot;</p><p>==================================================================</p><p>Hi, I find this of interest, in the comparison of musical note scales<br/>to the solar-planetary system because there is a shift in the solar-planetary<br/>system as John Kuefel points out in &quot;tuning&quot; a piano.  And therefore,<br/>Nature has its own rationale in different systems for why the IDEAL<br/>does not work out in REALITY.  As we note that DNA would make people<br/>come out certain ways, mutations in DNA makes the REALITY other than<br/>the IDEAL.  That seems to be the nature of reality based upon the ideal!</p><p>Today, the press is filled with the story of a new so-called planet<br/>outside the orbit of Pluto, yet it intersects the orbit of Pluto, as<br/>does Pluto&apos;s orbit intersect Neptune&apos;s.  The REALITY of the orbits is<br/>different than the IDEAL.  It is the IDEAL data which is the basis from<br/>which we all as practitioners in our disciplines make our choices.  And<br/>tuning a piano seems similar to the tuning I see in the solar-planetary<br/>system.  I hope we can achieve an understanding via language and math.</p><p>Bill Arnold</p><p>Bill Arnold<br/><a href="mailto:billarnoldfla@yahoo.com">billarnoldfla@yahoo.com</a><br/><a href="http://www.cwru.edu/affil/edis/scholars/arnold.htm">http://www.cwru.edu/affil/edis/scholars/arnold.htm</a><br/>Independent Scholar<br/>Independent Scholar, Modern Language Association<br/>-------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>  &quot;There is magic in the web&quot; Shakespeare (Othello, Act 3, Scene 4)<br/>-------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p>__________________________________________________<br/>Do you Yahoo!?<br/>Faith Hill - Exclusive Performances, Videos &amp; More<br/><a href="http://faith.yahoo.com">http://faith.yahoo.com</a></p></div><h3><a id=39363 href="#39363">ðŸ”—</a>Carl Lumma &#x3C;clumma@yahoo.com&#x3E;</h3><span>10/8/2002 10:56:53 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>&gt;&gt;My assertion is that it has everything to do with why the piano<br/>&gt;&gt;keyboard looks the way it does.

It is in connection with the latter activity<br/>&gt; that I have a question.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; With the help of a metronome to adjust the required beats I use a series<br/>&gt; of fourths and fifths to determine the pitches of the centre octave. I<br/>&gt; also refer back to the starting note to confirm whether I have perhaps<br/>&gt; made a mistake along the way. The problem with the finished product is<br/>&gt; that the one and a quarter octave intervals in the middle register do not<br/>&gt; sound very nice. E.g. the F below middle C played with the A(440) above<br/>&gt; middle C. (This inteval can probably be described as a Major 12th). My<br/>&gt; calculations show that these two notes should beat against each other at a<br/>&gt; rate of  7 beats per second, which sounds a bit out of tune to the human<br/>&gt; ear. So it seems my tuning is accurate and the problem lies with the equal<br/>&gt; tempered scale, which is at best a compromise. As one proceeds up the<br/>&gt; scale it becomes worse until the harmonic which causes the dissonance (the<br/>&gt; fifth harmonic of the lower note) becomes too weak to hear. I can &quot;solve&quot;<br/>&gt; the problem by raising the pitch of the lower note very slightly, but this<br/>&gt; has the effect that the octaves in the bass do not sound very pure because<br/>&gt; they are stretched slightly.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; The question is, can I &quot;detune&quot; something in order to lessen the effect,<br/>&gt; or do I have to learn to live with the phenomenon?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Andre du Plessis<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>DISCLAIMER:<br/>This message and any attachments are confidential and intended solely for<br/>the addressee.
