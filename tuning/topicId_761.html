In the<br/>end, it doesn&apos;t seem it directly implement any of the<br/>advise straight-out but it has ended up influenced in<br/>some way by all of it.</p><p>So thanks again and if you have the time check out the<br/>new version. It&apos;s a little bit longer and the tempo has<br/>been slowed down a notch and a (etheral electronic)<br/>choir singing 4 part harmony, and a couple other<br/>instruments have been added.</p><p>All voices are still in the Reperio tuning which I<br/>think works especially well with the choir voices.</p><p>As before, it is at:</p><p>  <a href="http://geocities.com/nonoctave/">http://geocities.com/nonoctave/</a></p><p>And as before all comments and reactions, good or bad<br/>are most welcome.</p><p>- Jeff</p></div>
