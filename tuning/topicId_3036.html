Why would you say that?</p><p>I think Leopold Auer was teaching his string pupils to use Pythagorean<br/>tuning (wide maj. 3rd and 6ths, and high leading tones) at the St.<br/>Petersburg Conservatory back in the late 19th cen.  This probably<br/>coincided with the application of lots of vibrato all the time to mask<br/>beats.  My ear tells me that Isaac Stern was an exemplary proponent of<br/>this school of tuning.  Fortunately (for my ears anyway), late 20th cen.<br/>tuning sensibility is breaking from this paradigm as demonstrated in<br/>fiddle playing by Itzhak Perlman and Hillary Hahn (listen to her<br/>unaccompanied Bach CD).</p><p>Fred Reinagel</p></div><h3>Patrick Pagano &#x3C;ppagano@xxxxxxxxx.xxxx&#x3E;</h3><span>5/14/1999 4:53:10 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Strings should be played with NO vibrato whatsoever!<br/>Pat</p><p>&gt; .
