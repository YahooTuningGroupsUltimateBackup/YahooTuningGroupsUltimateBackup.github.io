Originally recorded for Columbia Masterworks and long-since out<br/>of print, Innova, in conjunction with Sony Music Special Products,<br/>has reissued this central item of American musical history.  With the<br/>appearance of this recording, the complete works of Harry Partch<br/>(1901-1974), one of the most important of American artists, are<br/>available for the first time (the remaining works are published<br/>largely by innova&#xFFFD;s Enclosure series and the CRI Partch Collection).<br/>Like composer Conlon Nancarrow, Partch had to wait until late in life<br/>for his radical contributions to the arts to receive wide attention.<br/>With the 1969 production of Delusion he was &apos;discovered&apos;, idolized,<br/>and gurufied, as a 43-tone-to-the-octave, ex-hobo, eccentric,<br/>maverick, iconoclastic instrument-builder, and a &apos;philosophic<br/>music-man seduced into carpentry.&apos;  Hippy hyperbole notwithstanding,<br/>Partch was a genuine far-out radical whose time has come.  Again.<br/>Delusion of the Fury is a 72&#xFFFD; totally-integrated, corporeal,<br/>microtonal, elemental work of ritual theater, incorporating almost<br/>all of Partch&#xFFFD;s hand-built orchestra of sculptural instruments. Using<br/>mime, dance, music, vocalizations, lighting, and costume, Partch<br/>presents two tales concerning reconciliation of life and death, one<br/>after a Japanese Noh drama, the other after an Ethiopian folk tale.<br/>The vidoe release Enclosure Four: Harry Partch (Innova 404) features<br/>the film version of Delusion, but this is the first time that the<br/>high-quality stereo sound version is available on CD.  Perhaps the<br/>most astonishing, seductive and compelling of Partch&#xFFFD;s works,<br/>Delusion stands as the &apos;Choral Symphony&apos; or &apos;Ring Cycle&apos; do to other<br/>composers: a culminating testament to a lifetime of &apos;doing your own<br/>thing.&apos; The 16-page illustrated booklet features Partch&#xFFFD;s<br/>introduction and a new text by conductor Danlee Mitchell.&quot;</p><p>--<br/>* D a v i d         B e a r d s l e y<br/>*           <a href="mailto:xouoxno@virtulink.com">xouoxno@virtulink.com</a><br/>*<br/>* J u x t a p o s i t i o n  N e t  R a d i o<br/>*<br/>*<br/>* <a href="http://www.virtulink.com/immp/lookhere.htm">http://www.virtulink.com/immp/lookhere.htm</a></p></div>
