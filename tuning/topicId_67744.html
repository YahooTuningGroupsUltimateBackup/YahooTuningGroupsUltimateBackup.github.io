The 17-tone paper (from XH18) is finally online:<br/>&gt; &gt; <a href="http://xenharmony.wikispaces.com/space/showimage/17puzzle.pdf">http://xenharmony.wikispaces.com/space/showimage/17puzzle.pdf</a><br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; To some small extent, this paper reads like a brief in favor of 34<br/>&gt; tones.</p><p>My thinking about 34 has recently changed quite a bit (in favor of<br/>it), so I&apos;m much more inclined to agree with you now than when I<br/>wrote the paper (almost 5 years ago).</p><p>&gt; You feel that diatonic melody is superior with fifths sharp<br/>&gt; around this size, but also that diatonic harmony is nonexistent.</p><p>I&apos;d prefer to substitute &quot;traditional harmony&quot; for &quot;diatonic harmony&quot;<br/>in the above sentence.  There is a diatonic scale in 17, but it&apos;s<br/>superpythagorean, or non-5, in nature.</p><p>&gt; The<br/>&gt; most direct answer is Pajara/Diaschismic[14], 14 tones of two<br/>&gt; parallel chains of fifths. Or if you can wean yourself away from<br/>&gt; those chains of fifths, Pajara[10] or Pajara[12] a la Paul Erlich.</p><p>Yes, it&apos;s nice that you mention this.  Just last week I wrote Graham<br/>Breed off-list with some comments about his excellent article, _The<br/>Regular Mapping Paradigm_:<br/><a href="http://www.microtonal.co.uk/paradigm.html">http://www.microtonal.co.uk/paradigm.html</a></p><p>One portion of my comments, which I&apos;ll quote here, concerns a<br/>statement about applying the criterion of consistency when evaluating<br/>ET&apos;s:</p><p>BEGIN COMMENTS:</p><p>I take issue with this statement:</p><p>&lt;&lt; Once you can brand them inconsistent you can also consider them<br/>defective and so ignore them. &gt;&gt;</p><p>I find it tragic if someone interested in the 17 limit took this<br/>advice and thereby ignored both 34 and 46-ET.  It is only on account<br/>of a single interval (13:15) and its inversion that 46 is 15-limit<br/>inconsistent [might I add: 17-limit inconsistent], and the<br/>inconsistency is so slight as to be inconsequential.</p><p>In the case of 34, should we take 28deg34 rather than 27deg34 for<br/>4:7, then the inconsistency completely disappears!  While it&apos;s true<br/>that we&apos;ve increased the amount of error for 4:7 (to +19.4c instead<br/>of -15.9c), it should be taken into account that (as with major 3rds)<br/>a positive error for the harmonic 7th is more acceptable melodically<br/>than a negative error of similar magnitude; try it and &quot;see&quot; for<br/>yourself.  This is also consistent with using 17-ET (subset of 34) as<br/>a 13-limit non-5 tuning.  This is also the way prime 7 is mapped in<br/>pajara (which is arguably better in 34 than 22, if you weight the<br/>error of the intervals according to their relative consonance; again,<br/>listen for yourself).  Besides 4:7, there is only one other 17-limit<br/>consonance that would not have its best value: 14:17 (and its<br/>inversion).  Furthermore, I found that if I put two circles of my 17-<br/>tone well-temperament (see Xenharmonikon 18) 600 cents apart, then<br/>the best 4:7 in the best keys is in fact 28deg34, thereby making<br/>inconsistency a non-issue.</p><p>With all the interest in 17 lately, I suspect that I&apos;ll be writing a<br/>paper about 34 one of these days.</p><p>[And from a subsequent message, re 22 vs. 34]<br/>... Even though 22 is consistent at the 11 limit, you&apos;ll observe that<br/>the 6:7:9:11 chord doesn&apos;t come off well at all (on account of a bad<br/>9:11), whereas 34 is much better.  As you already know, at the 5<br/>limit it&apos;s no contest.</p><p>END OF COMMENTS</p><p>Let me draw attention to my statement that 34 is probably better than<br/>22 for pajara; I would say that the improvement is comparable to that<br/>of 31 vs. 19 for meantone.  I&apos;m thinking of melodic as well as<br/>harmonic considerations, particularly in that both 19 and 22 have<br/>narrow major 3rds,  which are not so desirable.</p><p>&gt; Both the harmonic and melodic resources are rich enough to began<br/>&gt; with, and of course if you&apos;ve gone ahead and actually tuned an<br/>&gt; instrument to 34 notes, as some people have managed sucessfully,<br/>you<br/>&gt; have complete harmonic freedom--no well temperaments need apply.</p><p>I don&apos;t think I would completely agree with that last phrase.  With<br/>34-WT (taken as two circles of 17-WT, as mentioned above), there<br/>would still be complete harmonic freedom, plus the additional<br/>dimension of differences in intonation (or &quot;mood&quot;) in different keys.</p><p>OTOH, the well-tempering improves only primes &gt;5, so it&apos;s arguable<br/>that WTing is really not beneficial in 34.</p><p>I would need more time to decide.</p><p>&gt; I note also you mention 41 but not 46 in your paper; 41 is a<br/>&gt; schismatic system, but 46 has fifths in the range you regard as<br/>&gt; melodically ideal.</p><p>Yes.  Another problem I find with 41 is with prime 5: not only is the<br/>tempering rather excessive for so many tones, but the major 3rd is<br/>narrow (and therefore less desirable melodically).</p><p>&gt; Of course, for many purposes both have too darn<br/>&gt; many notes.</p><p>Yes; in the mid-70&apos;s I was of the opinion that 31-ET (and, by<br/>implication, 34-ET) was around the upper limit of what could be<br/>considered practical for woodwind and valved brass instruments.</p><p>&gt; Have you or Margo ever toyed with 46? You&apos;ve mentioned you like it<br/>&gt; better than 31, and it seems pretty well up your and Margo&apos;s line.<br/>&gt; Smallish leading tones of 78 and 52 cents are of course available.<br/>&gt; The leapday temperament, using 27 degrees of 46 (the fifth) as a<br/>&gt; generator, has MOS of 12, 17 and 29 steps. The Pythagorean thirds<br/>are<br/>&gt; much, much closer--nearly pure--to 14/11 than in the case of 17.</p><p>Yes, I&apos;ve played with it in Scala from time to time.</p><p>&gt; The<br/>&gt; 17 MOS therefore has some of the advantages of a well-temperament,</p><p>Not so -- the best keys of 17-WT have *wider* 5ths than 17-ET, which<br/>improves primes 7, 11, and 13.</p><p>&gt; whereas the 29 MOS has a variety of harmony including the good 5-<br/>&gt; limit harmony of 46, but with all kinds of exotic possibilities. Of<br/>&gt; course if you get away from fifths as generators other<br/>possibilities<br/>&gt; open up, some involving rather small scales.</p><p>I haven&apos;t looked at 46 as closely as you have, but I agree that it<br/>has a lot of possibilities.</p><p>--George</p></div><h3><a id=67745 href="#67745">ðŸ”—</a>Gene Ward Smith &#x3C;genewardsmith@coolgoose.com&#x3E;</h3><span>10/18/2006 9:03:24 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;George D.
