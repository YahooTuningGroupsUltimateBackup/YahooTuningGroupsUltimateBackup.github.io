For one, it&apos;s a central feature in the the<br/>tradition of defining tetrachordal genera. For another, it is very often more<br/>useful to define a scale as a collection where a given scale step is<br/>represented by more than one ratio -- e.g. the sixth degree in a major scale<br/>might be represented by either 27/16 or 5/3, depending on the context, and<br/>that difference is important but also important is the fact that both<br/>rational values share qualities that can be group under the term &quot;Major<br/>sixth&quot;.</p><p>Daniel Wolf</p></div>
