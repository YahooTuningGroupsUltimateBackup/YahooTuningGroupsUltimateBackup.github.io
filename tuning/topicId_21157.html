I do have to make this as short as<br/>I can this time (not likely) since I really have to write an overdue<br/>program note for an Irving Fine program.  So I&apos;ll just try to clear up one<br/>thing here -- what I mean by &quot;theological arguments.&quot;</p><p>I can&apos;t remember the logician&apos;s technical term for such arguments (maybe<br/>someone can fill in the term?), but it&apos;s roughly a form of circular<br/>reasoning that assumes what you are trying to prove as a key in the proof<br/>itself, e.g., you start out with a premise and then, after an often<br/>lengthy (and even &quot;faultless&quot;) series of arguments, reach a conclusion<br/>that is virtually identical to the original premise.  I call such circular<br/>reasoning &quot;theological,&quot; not because it&apos;s related to the more famous<br/>medieval proofs of God&apos;s existence (which it is not), but because all such<br/>arguments begin with a (subjectively) unassailable article of faith such<br/>as &quot;the Bible is the literal truth&quot; -- the only way to &quot;prove&quot; this (which<br/>one who believes it isn&apos;t compelled to do), is to line up all observations<br/>and evidence in such a way that &quot;the Bible is the literal truth&quot; is true.</p><p>One of the most famous cases is presented by Galileo&apos;s defense of his work<br/>before the Inquisition.  The Church held, as an article of faith, that the<br/>Earth was unmoving at the center of creation.  Galileo reasoned otherwise<br/>from his invention and use of the telescope, and published a treatise with<br/>an essentially Copernican bent.  The Church would have been happy if<br/>Galileo could take all his observations and fit them into the immovable<br/>earth theory, but that&apos;s not how he saw it.  So his defense was this: God<br/>wrote TWO books -- the Bible and the Book of Nature; he was simply trying<br/>to read the latter and would gladly bow to the theologians in reading the<br/>former.  The Inquisition didn&apos;t buy it.  As Galileo was packed off to<br/>&quot;house arrest&quot; for most of the rest of his life, he made the still<br/>quotable statement: &quot;Still, it turns!&quot;</p><p>There&apos;s no arguing that the perfect fifth is a simple ratio (fact).  And I<br/>certainly wouldn&apos;t argue that this is a salient feature of many scale<br/>systems (fact).  But as soon as one starts to say something uncomfortably<br/>close to: THEREFORE any scale system (natural or synthetic) that does NOT<br/>exhibit the attribute of, say, being generated by the fifth, is of lesser<br/>importance or even inadmissable is logical poppycock.  Not only has it not<br/>been established that fifth-as-generator is a NECESSARY or even desireable<br/>attribute of all compositionally viable scales (I don&apos;t think I&apos;m<br/>misconstruing intent here), but it&apos;s a back-door (or possibly<br/>unintentional) attempt to logically derive a *value* from a *fact* contra<br/>David Hume and 2 1/2 centuries of attempts of some pretty bright people to<br/>discredit his argument.  You just can&apos;t LOGICALLY get an &quot;ought&quot; from an<br/>&quot;is&quot; without positing another &quot;ought&quot; statement as a minor premise.</p><p>When you attempt to discredit or shrug off something like ic vectors, this<br/>attempt is just absurd to me, since ic vectors, like much of what we&apos;re<br/>talking about here are simply &quot;tools&quot; for seeing or expressing<br/>relationships.  It&apos;s probably a better strategy to continue to look for<br/>what others see so much in.  For example, as it has been correctly noted<br/>here, the ic vector for the usual diatonic is V(D) = [254361].  The only<br/>other (12tet) heptachord with such a unique distribution of intervals is<br/>the 7-note chromatic whose vector is V(C) = [654321].  If you know a<br/>little bit about vectors you&apos;ll soon realize that, not only are the<br/>chromatic&apos;s entries in reverse consecutive order, which is not surprising,<br/>but that you can &quot;get&quot; V(C) &quot;from&quot; V(D) and vice versa by transposing<br/>V(D)&apos;s entries for ic1 and ic5:</p><p>&#x9;&#x9;254361<br/>&#x9;&#x9;&gt;|||&lt;|<br/>&#x9;&#x9;654321&#x9;&#x9;</p><p>Now, some ask &quot;So what?&quot;  Others ask &quot;Why?&quot;  The reason is that this<br/>reflects the arguably intuitive relationship between a circle of fifths<br/>and the chromatic circle, an operation commonly refered to as M5 or M7 --<br/>when you multiply any sonority by 5 or 7, you get the same ic vector with<br/>the reversal noted above.  For the circle sonorities such as the chromatic<br/>and 5th/4th stacks, this is hardly earth shattering news, but by<br/>generalizing it, you now have a leg up (though some might think this is<br/>still unimportant).</p><p>Again, others ask &quot;So what?&quot; while others ask &quot;What happens if we push<br/>onward.&quot;  By &quot;collapsing&quot;/&quot;enlarging&quot; all the fifths/m2nds in the diatonic<br/>(without even necessarily referring to an underlying chromatic there are<br/>several other conceptual ways to do this), you get a parallel system in<br/>which all the typical diatonic triads change with the exception of the<br/>diminished triad (which one might use to surf between the two systems),<br/>and in which all the usual *relationships* stay the same.  Here&apos;s an M5<br/>(multiply by a perfect fourth) version:</p><p>C  D  E  F  G  A  B (C)</p><p>C  Bb Ab Db B  A  G (C)</p><p>Unisons, m3 &amp; tritones stay the same; M2 &amp; M3 are inverted (e.g., M2 up<br/>becomes M2 down); and P5s become m2s and vice versa.  The &quot;primary<br/>triad&quot; C-E-G (43) becomes C-Ab-B (83) and V-I is some version of this:</p><p>B -&gt; B<br/>Bb-&gt; Ab<br/>G -&gt; C</p><p>I.e., Agmon&apos;s &quot;rules&quot; which he demonstrated only work for the diatonic,<br/>work in this parallel universe as well.  All chord functions work the<br/>same.  All neo-Riemannian relations work as well under re-defined<br/>(re-tuned?) intervals and voice leading.  E.g., one of Richard Cohn&apos;s<br/>parsimonious cycles works the same and produces the same &quot;hexatonic&quot;<br/>scale:</p><p>C Ab B<br/>C Eb B<br/>C Eb E<br/>G Eb E<br/>G Ab E<br/>G Ab B<br/>C Ab B</p><p>(but don&apos;t look for this version in Brahms!)</p><p>In abstract geometry, we say that these parallel systems &quot;cover&quot; one<br/>another under an M5/7 transformation (yes, we&apos;re now into geometry).  This<br/>means that the objects themselves may &quot;distort&quot; (predictably), but the<br/>relations between those objects remain the same (are invariant) -- like<br/>the earth projected onto a flat map.</p><p>The ONLY thing you can say judgementally about the process or result is<br/>that you don&apos;t like the sound of the distorted objects (the new basic<br/>chords) or the weird voice leading the new geometry implies (but doesn&apos;t<br/>have to be adhered to compositionally).  That&apos;s entirely subjective -- and<br/>how often have &quot;casual listeners&quot; said they don&apos;t like the sounds of other<br/>cultures?  But what you can&apos;t say is that no composer could ever come<br/>along and convince a suitably open ear to accept them via a suitable<br/>compositional treatment -- and the door opens to the unimaginable.</p><p>[Afterthought: This basic result can be generalized still further, if you<br/>wish, into other n-tet tunings.  I don&apos;t know if it has been proven<br/>anywhere, but I think it could be demonstrated that ANY chromatic segment<br/>of any (only even?) chromatic universe could be transformed by a suitable<br/>multiplier into a non-repeating ME scale (in a unique way?) and vice<br/>versa.  Since coordinate systems have been changed, it&apos;s even open to<br/>argument that the short non-ME chromatic segment itself is &quot;warped ME&quot; in<br/>these &quot;curved&quot; coordinates -- an idea worth at least thinking about since<br/>Block &amp; Douthett have identified these chromatic collections as &quot;minimally<br/>even,&quot; a category Douthett has extended into his particle physics<br/>applications of ME.]</p><p>More on other &quot;issues&quot; at a later date.</p><p>Still your colleague, Paul, but still rattling your cage ;-) and still<br/>hoping to convince you and others of the absolute value of the many-paths<br/>approach.</p><p>Steve</p></div><h3><a id=21169 href="#21169">ðŸ”—</a>PERLICH@ACADIAN-ASSET.COM</h3><span>4/16/2001 2:09:45 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Hi Stephen.</p><p>&gt;a category Douthett has extended into his particle physics<br/>&gt;applications of ME.</p><p>May I ask you what you mean by &quot;particle physics&quot; here, and what<br/>these applications are?</p></div>
