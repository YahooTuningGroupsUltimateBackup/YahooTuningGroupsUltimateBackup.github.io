He may have come up with this idea<br/>after discussing 22-tone tunings with me. Several years ago, we discussed my<br/>interpretation of ancient Indian tuning, which came up again a few days ago. It<br/>seems that although 5/3 and 27/16, a syntonic comma apart, were considered<br/>sruti #s 16 and 17, respectively, 16/15 and 135/128, a diaschisma apart were<br/>both considered sruti # 2. Graham describes regular temperaments which<br/>consistently distinguish the syntonic comma but not the diaschisma, and so<br/>could serve as a model for ancient Indian tuning.</p></div>
