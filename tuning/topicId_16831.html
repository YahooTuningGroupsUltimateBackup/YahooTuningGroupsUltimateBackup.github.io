Of course I invite any assistance, and<br/>hope in the next months to produce a tentative cassette version of<br/>some performances and improvisations on a Yamaha TX-802 in various<br/>neo-Gothic tunings which possibly might be used to generate some<br/>appropriate Web versions. Maybe we could call it &quot;Music from the<br/>pre-General-MIDI Era.&quot;</p><p>Recently Joseph Pehrson and Dan Wolf (happily returned to this List<br/>despite some significant financial barriers affecting users in various<br/>parts of our &quot;global village&quot;) were discussing the theme of &quot;rewrites<br/>of history,&quot; and I wonder if that phrase doesn&apos;t sum up about 90% of<br/>what music means to me. While the experiment I&apos;m about to describe may<br/>reflect one very aurally concrete side of that phrase, a recent<br/>discussion of 46-tone equal temperament (46-tET) may reveal another.</p><p>One reason &quot;rewrites of history&quot; can encompass an immense scope of<br/>musical variety and what we might term &quot;innovation&quot; (paradoxically or<br/>otherwise) is that history, to borrow from Admiral Grace Hopper,<br/>offers so many standards to choose from.</p><p>For some people, 46-tET represents a not-so-close approximation of<br/>ratios of 3, 5, and 7, after the manner of the 22 srutis. This<br/>discussion seemed oriented especially to fretted instruments, long<br/>associated with equal temperaments, so there may be reasons to prefer<br/>46-tET which might not be so obvious to me as a keyboard player<br/>uninitiated in such fretted instruments.</p><p>However, for me, 46-tET means above all &quot;virtually pure 14:11 major<br/>thirds.&quot; I consider it a kind of neo-Gothic equivalent of 31-tET with<br/>its near-pure 5:4 major thirds, and in fact 46-tET comes even closer,<br/>something like 417.39 cents in contrast to a true 14:11 at ~417.51<br/>cents. Of course, there&apos;s also the diminished fourth and augmented<br/>second at not too far from 21:17 and 17:14; I consider these also<br/>principal intervals which give 46-tET its musical identity.</p><p>Yes, we can also get rough approximations of 7-based ratios, which I<br/>tend to describe in keyboard terms: a &quot;large major second&quot; for a<br/>near-7:6, or a &quot;large major sixth&quot; for a near-7:4. This means that<br/>with two keyboards tuned a 46-tET diesis (~52.17 cents) apart, playing<br/>D-E* or D-B* (an asterisk showing a note on the upper keyboard) will<br/>produce these rather 7-ish ratios.</p><p>Here I&apos;m tempted to add that if I really wanted to optimize those<br/>&quot;7-flavor ratios,&quot; however, I would temper the fifths a tad more and<br/>use an &quot;e-based&quot; temperament where they are about 2.65 cents wide<br/>(~704.61 cents). This gives a virtually pure 7:4, and a closer 7:6<br/>and 9:7 than in 46-tET -- but an augmented second, for example, further<br/>from a &quot;supraminor&quot; ratio of 17:14, which 46-tET better approximates.</p><p>However, our &quot;real life alternative history novel&quot; gets stranger at<br/>this point, because I need to remember that probably most people<br/>reading this normally assume that thirds are stable intervals, whereas<br/>in neo-Gothic music they are just as routinely unstable. Similarly a<br/>&quot;7:4&quot; might mean something quite different in a neo-Gothic 12:14:18:21<br/>contracting to a fifth than in a 19th-century 4:5:6:7. Isn&apos;t it fun<br/>how something like &quot;46-tET&quot; can set off such different views, serving<br/>as a kind of musical portal into alternative realities?</p><p>Enough of theory; now to that concrete experiment.</p><p>When I made an inquiry late last week about TX-802 timbres for<br/>&quot;locking-in&quot; JI partials a la Dave Keenan, to whom I am immensely<br/>indebted for the experiment which follows, Jacky Ligon responded via<br/>e-mail most obligingly and in step-by-step detail as to how to create<br/>such a harmonic timbre for this synthesizer from the front panel.</p><p>Jacky, your steps guided me with a true user-friendly aplomb through<br/>the process of setting up a harmonic texture with some qualities of a<br/>reed organ, or maybe a harmonium, featuring both even and odd<br/>partials.</p><p>Using some familiar built-in timbres, which I favor for emulating such<br/>medieval and Renaissance instruments as harpsichords, organs, and<br/>crumhorns, I had already noticed that the pure 7-based versions of<br/>unstable sonorities in my 2-3-7 neo-Gothic JI scheme did have a<br/>certain &quot;smoothness&quot; distinguishing them from the usual complex<br/>Pythagorean 3-based ones -- but that both versions could sound &quot;in<br/>tune.&quot;</p><p>However, I wondered, what difference might a dedicated harmonic timbre<br/>make? Would the 7-based intervals stand out in a special way as more<br/>&quot;concordant,&quot; or the complex 3-based intervals become especially<br/>strident or tense?</p><p>Having set up the timbre, I was ready to learn through experience,<br/>just as Roger Bacon advocated about 750 years ago.</p><p>What I found, maybe with a mild feeling of surprise, was that the<br/>usual complex Pythagorean intervals sounded quite normal and &quot;in<br/>tune,&quot; and the 7-based intervals indeed audibly &quot;smooth,&quot; and at the<br/>same time somewhat &quot;strange&quot; -- maybe more so that using a &quot;puff pipe&quot;<br/>organ or harpsichord emulation.</p><p>The beating on a usual Pythagorean sonority such as g-b-e&apos; or G3-B3-E4<br/>(64:81:108) sounded &quot;warm,&quot; &quot;familiar,&quot; &quot;at-home,&quot; while the same<br/>sonority as a pure 7:9:12 sounded a bit &quot;strange&quot; as well as smooth --<br/>as if the beatlessness placed it in a certain bold, almost stark,<br/>relief. The latter effect, of course, has its own fascination, and<br/>lends a special kind of emphasis to a cadence.</p><p>However, it wasn&apos;t a simple dichotomy of simpler means necessarily<br/>more &quot;concordant&quot; or &quot;in tune.&quot; I&apos;m almost tempted to propose a<br/>bumpersticker, although without an automobile on which to display it:<br/>&quot;27:16 gives me a warm fuzzy.&quot;</p><p>This experiment also let me experience the kaleidoscopic nature of my<br/>own musical perception: 14:18:21 (e.g. f-a-c&apos; or F3-A3-C4 in a 7-based<br/>version) might sound either very strident or alluringly smooth in a<br/>different way.</p><p>Anyway, my experiment with the Dave Keenan &quot;locking-in partials&quot;<br/>timbre, courtesy of Jacky Ligon as TX-802 and documentation maven,<br/>showed me that I hear complex Pythagorean intervals as &quot;in tune&quot; in<br/>this acoustical setting, and 7-based intervals as different, often<br/>strange and often alluring, supplementing but not supplanting those<br/>complex 3-based ratios.</p><p>Here I can picture someone adding, as I&apos;ll do myself: &quot;Of course you<br/>like the &grave;warm fuzziness&apos; of the beating in a 27:16, because it whets<br/>your appetite for the stable octave you&apos;ve been conditioned by some 30<br/>years of musical experience and practice to expect will follow; keep<br/>in mind just how culturally specific the results of this experiment<br/>are, whatever universals of &apos;harmonic entropy&apos; might obtain.&quot;</p><p>Where to go from here? One possibility occurring to me a few days<br/>before this experiment is a kind of fusion between Easley Blackwood&apos;s<br/>remarks on JI and the textural contrasts of the late 16th-century<br/>madrigal exemplified by Gesualdo around 1600.</p><p>How about a neo-Gothic 2-3-5-7 JI style with slow passages featuring<br/>mostly note-against-note motion with pure low-integer sonorities<br/>(slowing down permits an easier time at the keyboard as well as more<br/>appreciation of the pure sonorities), and faster passages with more<br/>complex Pythagorean intervals? One thing the experiment confirms: I<br/>want to keep those pleasantly fuzzy and beatful Pythagorean intervals<br/>available for those slower passages also -- why not enjoy the full<br/>variety?</p><p>Anyway, John and Jacky, I&apos;m posting an article on defining JI from a<br/>&quot;three-dimensional&quot; viewpoint which will consider both complex<br/>integer-ratio systems and adaptive JI tunings; thank you both for<br/>providing much of the substance for this article in practice and<br/>theory.</p><p>Most appreciatively,</p><p>Margo Schulter<br/><a href="mailto:mschulter@value.net">mschulter@value.net</a></p></div>
