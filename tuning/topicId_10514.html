It seems that anything greater that 250 gets<br/>reduced to 250.  A work-around is to change the time signature, 4/4-&gt;2/4,<br/>6/8-&gt;3/8, 3/4-&gt;?  I have also found that Cakewalk moves program changes to<br/>the beginning of a track if it is the first event on the track.  This really<br/>creates problems when multiple tracks share the same MIDI channel.  I get<br/>around that one by putting an extra measure with a short, ppp note at the<br/>beginning of each track.  Most the time, though, I just use another sequencer.</p><p>Brian</p><p>&gt;Message: 2<br/>&gt;   Date: Wed, 07 Jun 2000 08:17:40 -0600<br/>&gt;   From: &quot;John A. deLaubenfels&quot; &lt;<a href="mailto:jadl@idcomm.com">jadl@idcomm.com</a>&gt;<br/>&gt;Subject: Cakewalk speed problems<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;I&apos;ve just heard from a list member that, playing retuned versions of<br/>&gt;wamk280 (one of the Mozart pieces I&apos;ve posted recently) through<br/>&gt;Cakewalk, the pace of the piece is slower than the original.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;I seem to remember hearing a similar lament from another list member<br/>&gt;a few months back, also involving Cakewalk.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;I do rearrange the MIDI clock definition, in order to achieve .001 sec<br/>&gt;per clock pulse, but I&apos;m PRETTY sure I&apos;m doing it correctly; also, the<br/>&gt;pieces play fine on, for example, Media Player, which comes with Win 95.<br/>&gt;(and if Uncle Bill can get it right, surely the rest of us can as well!)<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;I don&apos;t have Cakewalk and haven&apos;t used it, but I&apos;m guessing it&apos;s trying<br/>&gt;to be &quot;too clever&quot; in some way that could possibly be turned off.<br/>&gt;Does anybody know more about this?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;Thanks!<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;JdL<br/>&gt;</p></div>
