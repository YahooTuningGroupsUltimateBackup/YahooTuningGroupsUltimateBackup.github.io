To this day,<br/>the chant sung in moveable do countries is probably going to be closer to<br/>triadic just intonation than that in fixed do countries where &quot;perfect<br/>pitch&quot; -- meaning, in this case, memory of 12tet -- is valued and rehearsal<br/>is conducted with a reference keyboard nearby. Similarly, there is a lot of<br/>evidence that singers rehearsed to a monochord in the late middle ages and<br/>a pythagorean division of the instrument was ubiquitous.</p><p>The idea that the intonation is influenced or determined by the reverberant<br/>effects of resonant spaces is an attractive one (works by Stuart Dempster<br/>and Alvin Lucier are very suggestive modern responses to this), but<br/>difficult to pin down historically. (Possibly of more interest would be to<br/>trace the emergence of accellated harmonic rhythm in the Baroque era in the<br/>increasingly dry acoustics of the Baroque architecture.) In any case, the<br/>chant repertoire was composed very much prior to the beginning of the<br/>period of large church construction.</p><p>But what effects might have the larger churches had on subsequent<br/>performance practice? My own experiences in playing in Gothic and<br/>Romanesque churches have been radically different acoustical situations,<br/>but the fact that these rooms resonate very low frequencies so well<br/>contributes to my impresssion that a sustained 9:8 major second in the<br/>treble range with its implied fundamental 3 octaves below is not an order<br/>of magnitude less consonant than a 5:4 major third with an implied<br/>fundamental 2 octaves below.

I thought there was a letter missing<br/>somewhere or something. :-)</p><p>This may relate to my perception that American singers tune<br/>more tempered than European ones.  I don&apos;t know<br/>anything about European music training, but I suppose it<br/>must<br/>rely more on harmonic theory and orchestral instruments, and<br/>less on<br/>pianos, than American music training (with which I&apos;m all too<br/>familiar).  Or maybe there&apos;s just more of a continuation of<br/>tradition over there.</p><p>&gt; Similarly, there is a lot of<br/>&gt; evidence that singers rehearsed to a monochord in the late middle ages and<br/>&gt; a pythagorean division of the instrument was ubiquitous.</p><p>I have thought some about the influence of habit on<br/>intonation.  I think it&apos;s clear that someone who practices<br/>everyday tuning his voice to a piano or a Pythagorean<br/>monochord is not going to walk into an echoy environment and<br/>instantly start tuning his thirds to 5/4.  But if he stopped<br/>practicing singing with the cursED PIANO FOR A WHILE<br/>([breathing hard and calming down] sorry!) and sang often in<br/>reverberant spaces, he might well begin gravitating that<br/>way.</p><p>&gt; My own experiences in playing in Gothic and<br/>&gt; Romanesque churches have been radically different acoustical situations,<br/>&gt; but the fact that these rooms resonate very low frequencies so well<br/>&gt; contributes to my impresssion that a sustained 9:8 major second in the<br/>&gt; treble range with its implied fundamental 3 octaves below is not an order<br/>&gt; of magnitude less consonant than a 5:4 major third with an implied<br/>&gt; fundamental 2 octaves below. My very tentative conclusion is that it is<br/>&gt; both possible and hospitable to sing in pythagorean intonation in large<br/>&gt; churches.</p><p>Wouldn&apos;t it be more fitting to compare major thirds with<br/>major thirds?  The 81/64 implied fundamental, at 6 octaves<br/>below, would normally be sub-sonic for male vocals (Tiny Tim<br/>notably excepted).  There&apos;s maybe a good order of magnitude<br/>between that and 5/4 (and between Tiny Tim and most other<br/>male vocalists).  Even medieval theory holds the ditone<br/>somewhat unstable.  It might also be pointed out that 10/9<br/>is only slightly more dissonant than 9/8 by this criterion,<br/>and 7/4 is less so.</p><p>&gt; I find the recordings by Anonymous 4 to be wildly inconsistant in<br/>&gt; intonation.</p><p>Good ears.  My spectrographic analysis agrees.  (Strangely,<br/>this hasn&apos;t reduced the severity of my crush on them at<br/>all.)  Of course, they&apos;re American.  Actually, they have an<br/>Irish lass now, but she&apos;s only on the most recent release &quot;A<br/>Lamas Ladymass&quot; which I, regrettably, don&apos;t yet own.</p><p>Come to think of it, when I listen to European-made madrigal<br/>recordings, the female voices are the ones that most often<br/>noticeably miss (NPI) Just Intonation.  It&apos;s not uncommon to<br/>hear wonderful consonance when the soprano is on the root of<br/>the chord and not when she&apos;s got the third.  This could be<br/>because melodic concerns are stronger than vertical ones for<br/>the soprano part in motets with some homophonic character.<br/>Or could it be that women have a lesser bent toward JI than<br/>men?  (Ohhh, now I&apos;ve gone and done it...)</p><p>&gt; They perform in a register that is most likely to be higher<br/>&gt; than that of the original pitch level, so any conclusions about the<br/>&gt; historical intonation are suspect when made on the basis of these<br/>&gt; performances.</p><p>But you said that movable dos increase the likelihood of JI<br/>intonation.</p><p>Plus, why should register matter to the supposition whether:</p><p>a) unaccompanied singers of diatonic melody tend toward JI,<br/>b) and if so, whether the &quot;virtual polyphony&quot; created by<br/>long and loud reverberation, as found in Gothic<br/>architecture, promotes tuning to higher primes.</p><p>Actually, I guess the original supposition was that<br/>intonation of chant, while<br/>previously in tunings unknowable, began to shape towards<br/>5-limit JI when it began to be sung in the great<br/>cathedrals.  It should be noted that while historical<br/>questions lay at the root of this discussion, the pursuit<br/>and analysis of data from a cappella singing has taken on a<br/>life of its own.

What does it<br/>&gt; say about the likelihood that 81/64 would be sung accurately<br/>&gt; (a cappella), even in compositions that used the interval in<br/>&gt; theory?</p><p>Paul&apos;s Harmonic Entropy (or &apos;cognitive dissonance&apos;, his<br/>preferred name for it) theory simply says that we are much<br/>more likely to *perceive* any particular interval as the<br/>smallest-number ratio which falls within the probablility<br/>range for that intevallic _gestalt_.</p><p>The probability of perceiving any particular ratio depends<br/>upon two things: the size of its numbers, and exactly where<br/>it lies under the probability bell curves surrounding the<br/>small-number ratios lying near it.</p><p>By his theory, 81:64 is a ratio which simply has such large<br/>numbers that it&apos;s unlikely that we&apos;ll perceive it as such.<br/>This is exactly what I was saying in this thread about a<br/>week ago, when I suggested that other simpler ratios would<br/>probably be sung for the wider-than-5:4 &apos;major 3rd&apos;.</p><p>However, at the same time, given my prediliction for prime<br/>factoring, I would say that 3^4 (= 81:64) is not such a<br/>complicated interval.

Erlich wrote:</p><p>&gt; 81/64 would probably occur with a rather large error. I wouldn&apos;t be<br/>&gt; surprised if it occasionally came out as small as 5/4 or as large as 9/7 in<br/>&gt; medieval practice. Harmonic thirds were not stable sonorities so they went<br/>&gt; by fairly quickly in the music, too quickly for much accuracy to be<br/>&gt; attained.</p><p>In polyphony, yes.  In plain chant, &quot;harmonic,&quot; &quot;stable,&quot;<br/>and &quot;quickly&quot; are less relevant concepts to the abstract<br/>composition, though possibly not to the performance in a<br/>highly resonant environment.  It&apos;s not at all uncommon in<br/>plain chant to have a phrase like:</p><p>C C D E E D E F E D E D</p><p>which would cause the Es to be sung over the reverb of the<br/>Cs.  In such as case, the simple 5-limit tetrachord</p><p>1/1 9/8 5/4 4/3</p><p>would produce maximum consonance for the singers&apos; ears, not<br/>Pythagorean, and certainly not a 9/7 between the C and E.<br/>It would surprise me less in such a case to hear a 10/9<br/>between the C and D (and 9/8 above) than to hear a stack of<br/>9/8s.  Now if you get a short enough reverb that the Cs are<br/>almost inaudible by the time the Es arrive, then 5-limit<br/>probably has as little chance as Pythagorean.</p><p>Paul, you&apos;ve been very helpful in clearing up<br/>misunderstandings and factual errors, and you&apos;ve stated that<br/>you disagree with my conclusion, but you haven&apos;t said why.<br/>Or maybe I just can&apos;t read what&apos;s between your lines?  I&apos;m<br/>not firmly decided on the issue yet, BTW.  Just exploring<br/>the possible validity of the supposition, and leaning<br/>somewhat toward it for plain chant.</p><p>&gt; In principle though, the logic of the scale was Pythagorean, so<br/>&gt; the &quot;target&quot; for the major third would be 81/64. The implied fundamental, or<br/>&gt; lack thereof, has absolutely nothing to do with it.</p><p>I agree with that.  Neither Dan nor I was trying to say that<br/>it does.  My purpose in bringing it up was to show that it<br/>doesn&apos;t.  Dan had seemingly compared 5/4 to 9/8, and I felt<br/>that was not a valid, since they represent two different<br/>intervals.  Later he explained more thoroughly what he<br/>meant, and it was not what I had taken it to mean, so my<br/>&quot;argument&quot; served only to prompt a clearing up of what was<br/>being said, as in fact it was designed to do.</p><p>David</p></div><h3><a id=3635 href="#3635">ðŸ”—</a>David J.

A singer<br/>isn&apos;t waiting to perceive an interval one way or the other.<br/>S/he knows when s/he is singing a third against another tone<br/>and will try to tune it based on:</p><p>1) a practiced tuning<br/>2) ear (which is influenced by #1)<br/>3) a theory about how it &quot;should&quot; be tuned</p><p>The stronger the role played by #2, the more likely, IMHO,<br/>that a third will be tuned 5-limit.  I said to Paul earlier<br/>that he was right about Pythagorean tuning for polyphonic<br/>song, which goes against what you said:</p><p>&gt; Note that my theories about perceiving 5-limit overtones in<br/>&gt; a cathedral, which I would defend, are specifically in connection<br/>&gt; with polyphonic singing.</p><p>Now that I think about it again, I&apos;m not so sure one way or<br/>the other.  Even with the thirds being regarded as unstable,<br/>and seemingly going by quickly, if the environment is<br/>causing virtually the whole scale (plus ficta) to sound at<br/>once, 5-limit JI should reduce the amount of perceived<br/>dissonance as compared with Pythagorean tuning, making for a<br/>more physically sensuous experience.  But were they<br/>concerned about making music a sensuous experience?  It<br/>might be argued that our current obsession with experience<br/>results from the relatively recent widespread acceptance of<br/>humanism, which is antithetical to medieval philosophy.</p><p>The musical form of the question is whether singers of such<br/>compositions would have more likely relied on their ears or<br/>on their knowledge of the theory to tune thirds.  How<br/>concerned were they about maximizing consonance?  Judging by<br/>the compositions themselves, the composers didn&apos;t lose a lot<br/>of sleep over it.  The theorists evidently saw it in terms<br/>of a continuum to be traversed.  But the performers?  Could<br/>be a different story.
