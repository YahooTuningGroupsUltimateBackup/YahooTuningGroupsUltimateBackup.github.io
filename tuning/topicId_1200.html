I&apos;d like to<br/>say more but will make an observation about differences<br/>between a 1.5 cent wide 7/4 and an 8 cent wide 7/4 I&apos;ve<br/>noted or believe I&apos;ve noted on the piano.  The 8 cent wide<br/>7/4 is a lot closer than the 12 TET 31 cent wide 7/4 or the<br/>&quot;wide&quot; 1/4 comma MT 7th which is 38 cents wide of 7/4.<br/>In intended 4:5:6:7 chords is still has some slight harshness<br/>or feeling of being a bit off, while the 7/4 which is only 1.5<br/>cents wide just seems to have a subtle more powerful<br/>appeal and emotionality.  I had my piano recently tuned to<br/>a JI scheme with three rows of slightly stretched from just<br/>fifths (1 cent wide) and slightly stretched 5/4 and 6/5 thirds<br/>1/2 cent wide.  With this tuning, the G# would be 7.8 cents<br/>plus 3 cents or 10.8 cents wide from a just 7/4 on Bb, but<br/>I had that single pitch class - G# - tuned lower, sacrificing<br/>the C# - G# fifth and the E - G# major thirds in order to<br/>have nearly just 7/4 on Bb and a 7/6 on F wide by only .5<br/>cents.</p><p>In 1/4 comma MT tuning, there are two very close<br/>approximations to the 4:5:6:7 chords and these chords have a<br/>very smooth consonant sound.  Still, to my hearing, the<br/>considerably closer approximation I presently have seems<br/>to have a more emotionally intense character - which pervades<br/>the different inversions of the chord, ninth chord harmonies - here, in the<br/>4:5:6:7:9 chord all the thirds are wide by .5 cents.</p><p>I might speculate that having the 7 really close to just<br/>tends to intensify a Chopinesque character to music played<br/>in something like his style using nearly just harmonies on<br/>the piano.</p><p>I had the intervals tuned slightly wide from just in an effort to<br/>achieve a harmonious sound best suited to the piano&apos;s<br/>slightly wide-stretched partials.  I also had the unisons<br/>detuned more than usual - 3 cents separation highest and<br/>lowest pitch of a trichord unison for eight of the pitches and<br/>4.5 cents separation for the B, F#, C#, and G# which usually<br/>form major thirds (or for C# and G#, app. 7/4 sevenths also)<br/>on other notes.  This is an experiment.  Maybe I detuned the<br/>unisons too much, but in some ways this seems to have<br/>improved the piano&apos;s sound, depending on what music is played.</p><p>An added comment regarding the piano - in my opinion, the<br/>piano can sound really beautiful when it is tuned otherwise<br/>than to 12 TET and for many of us, until very recently we<br/>never heard a piano tuned to anything but 12 TET and I had<br/>some kind of thought that if a piano were tuned differently<br/>than to 12 TET, it might explode or suffer some similar<br/>horrendous damage (exaggerating slightly).  For my ears,<br/>putting the piano into a harmonious tuning suddenly turns<br/>the instrument into a HARMONIOUS instrument as well as<br/>a smooth sounding complex subtly impressionistic almost<br/>harmonious musical instrument - difficult to get precisely<br/>the right shade of expression for the 12 TET piano&apos;s falling<br/>short of really sounding beautifully harmonious.  Of course,<br/>even when tuned to a just intonation pattern, the piano is<br/>probably not as harmonious sounding as a really skilled and<br/>careful vocal group could be because of the inharmonicity of<br/>its strings&apos; partials, but I agree with Carl Lumma that with<br/>some changes, including more notes per octave, and with<br/>a change in the way its tuning is thought of - a questioning<br/>of the satisfactoriness of 12 TET - the piano may have more<br/>life ahead than it has had up to the present time.</p></div><h3><a id=1208 href="#1208">ðŸ”—</a>Dave Keenan &#x3C;d.keenan@xx.xxx.xxx&#x3E;</h3><span>3/3/1999 5:46:57 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p><a href="mailto:Ascend11@aol.com">Ascend11@aol.com</a> wrote:</p><p>&gt;&#x9;The discussions have been intriguing recently.

This will result in Just 7/4&apos;s, and 7/6&apos;s and 7/5&apos;s that are also 1.9 cents narrow. Then apply your stretch (evenly?) on top of that.</p><p>Regards,<br/>-- Dave Keenan<br/><a href="http://dkeenan.com">http://dkeenan.com</a></p></div>
