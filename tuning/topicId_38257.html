I cannot<br/>help but feel that the only reason for &apos;adding pitches&apos; is to explore more<br/>distant harmonic relationships. Inharmonic ones too; but what guides us is<br/>the need for a measure of harmonic relatedness amongst the various tones,<br/>and a sense of &apos;repose&apos; and a sense of &apos;movement&apos;. How we define these<br/>terms is dependent upon many factors, and certainly more than just the<br/>abstract &apos;pitch&apos; of a note.</p><p>I can&apos;t hold with the</p><p>microtonal == atonal</p><p>argument. For me, microtonality is tonality with wider pallette of tones.</p><p>M</p><p>&gt; Yes, I know that not everything is going to appeal to everyone and<br/>&gt; that, when it comes to taste, &quot;mass&quot; often correlates with &quot;crass.&quot;<br/>&gt; But in order for art to be successful, it must communicate, and in<br/>&gt; order to communicate it must have an audience outside one&apos;s own<br/>&gt; circle of artists or composers.  Is this more likely to happen by<br/>&gt; pursuing an atonal or pantonal approach or by establishing an<br/>&gt; expanded harmonic vocabulary through the employment of intervals<br/>&gt; representing or approximating those found above the sixth harmonic<br/>&gt; (while reaffirming the traditional concept of tonality, including the<br/>&gt; principle of consonance and dissonance)?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Such is the rationale for advocating the approach to microtonality<br/>&gt; that I have taken.</p></div><h3><a id=38266 href="#38266">ðŸ”—</a>jpehrson2 &#x3C;jpehrson@rcn.com&#x3E;</h3><span>6/27/2002 6:55:27 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In tuning@y..., &quot;Mark Gould&quot; &lt;mark.gould@a...&gt; wrote:</p><p><a href="/tuning/topicId_38257.html#38257">/tuning/topicId_38257.html#38257</a></p><p>&gt; Especially the bit about reaffirming the bit about tonality.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I do like a good bit of Schoenberg, and some Webern, but one always<br/>feels that there is something very &apos;tonal&apos; about their serial<br/>writing.</p><p>***Hello Mark!</p><p>I think the *repeated notes* even in Schoenberg&apos;s *most* serialized<br/>work set up a sense of rootedness or &quot;tonality...&quot;  Where&apos;s Monzo??</p><p>Same for Milton Babbitt.
