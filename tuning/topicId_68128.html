This CD will astound you<br/>Reviewer: Tobia Conforto<br/>I haven&apos;t listened to much microtonality before, especially not applied to classical music. Therefore I met this CD with hesitation, but I was repayed with awesomeness! In this recording you can clearly hear the different tuning of the whole orchestra, one which our ears aren&apos;t familiar with; yet it has a wholesome feeling to it. You hear frequencies you don&apos;t recognize; yet you understand the notes they represent, better than if they were played on our &apos;universal&apos; modern tuning. It gets better: this peculiar intonation gives all sorts of moods and &apos;colors&apos; to the music, ones that I never expected to find in baroque compositions. This performance was not the experiment of a group of visionaries. They claim it to be the way music was performed centuries ago, at the time of Bach. I&apos;m an amateur, but my ears tell me there&apos;s some truth to it. If Bach&apos;s music seems cold and bare to you, I promise you&apos;ll change your mind. If you already love it, you will be astounded. Now I&apos;m left wondering why more music is not performed this way...<br/>________________________________________________________________________<br/>Check out the new AOL.
