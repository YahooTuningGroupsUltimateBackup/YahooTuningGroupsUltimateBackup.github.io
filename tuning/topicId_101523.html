I did this in relation to Arabic<br/>maqam music to get the ball rolling, in which the two neutral thirds<br/>and neutral seconds are the same size, just for starters. I think this<br/>approach could be used to analyze regional variants in which they<br/>differ as well.</p><p>This temperament simply describes how intervals are grouped together<br/>as sharing a scalar position or function, without necessitating that<br/>anyone mistune the intervals to hit some ugly middle of the road<br/>tempered tuning that sucks the intonational fun out of maqam music.<br/>Hence while it is a &quot;temperament&quot; in the sense that it does describe a<br/>homomorphism from JI to a set of period/generator coordinates, it&apos;s<br/>designed specifically to be adaptive, as any performance on something<br/>like an oud will be. Hence while a fifth is mapped to two neutral<br/>thirds, you&apos;re free to make those neutral thirds whatever size you<br/>want, or even change them dynamically depending on musical context. So<br/>tempered intervals should be thought of as &quot;sharing an equivalence<br/>class,&quot; rather than sharing a single mistuned approximation.</p><p>The three issues with approaching maqam music in this way have generally been</p><p>1) Whether the Almighty Maqam Tuning should incorporate all of the<br/>intonational nuances inherent in the performance of actual maqam<br/>music, which may include very complex RI ratios, or whether it should<br/>reflect the much coarser structure of how the music is notated<br/>2) Whether or not ratios should be picked as intonational pitch<br/>markers, or if they should reflect whether or not the interval gets<br/>resolved properly by the auditory system as a virtual pitch<br/>3) Whether or not ratios should be used at all for melodic music,<br/>since no F0 analysis is occurring for asynchronous harmonics</p><p>For point #1, since there are so terribly many different intonational<br/>nuances, and since they vary from region to region, and since we can<br/>continue to argue all day about whether or not the two neutral thirds<br/>making up a fifth should be equal, I want to leave the issue entirely<br/>open and treat it as a separate layer under what I&apos;m doing here. This<br/>is the coarse structure we&apos;re describing, and the finer discussion<br/>about regional maqam intonational practices should continue<br/>undeterred.</p><p>Point #2 represents whether or not you prefer to use ratios to denote<br/>modes of virtual pitch resolution, or to denote sizes for pitches in<br/>pitch space. For example, 11/9 sometimes sounds like a completely<br/>unresolved, inharmonic, neutral third. Is that just &quot;what 11/9 sounds<br/>like&quot; when played as a bare dyad apart from any musical context, or<br/>does that mean that in that context it&apos;s &quot;not 11/9 at all&quot;? The issue<br/>is primarily one of semantics, but I note that the &quot;ic&quot; suffix has<br/>been used for shameless regular temperament models of naturally<br/>occurring tunings in this way (&quot;pelogic&quot;, &quot;ragismic,&quot; etc). Hence, the<br/>name &quot;maqamic&quot; is appropriate here, and the larger semantic issue (and<br/>any related psychoacoustic nuances about pitch perception) need not be<br/>brought up now.</p><p>Point #3 is adequately addressed by calling this &quot;maqamic&quot; temperament<br/>and admitting it exists primarily as mimicry. It also serves as a cue<br/>for the adventurous xenharmonicist to do something fun and different,<br/>like reimagine maqam music in a harmonic context (those neutral thirds<br/>can be 11/9 if you want them to be!), or expand maqam music out into a<br/>larger chromatic context that uses the 10-note MOS, or to generally<br/>create music that attempts to bridge cultures, etc.</p><p>So what&apos;s the coarse scalar structure for Arabic maqam music? Well,<br/>24-equal itself is, if anything, too fine, as it reflects a particular<br/>intonational choice for a more general rank-2 pattern: all of the<br/>maqamat are MODMOS&apos;s of the 3L4s MOS (neutral third generator). This<br/>suggests an even simpler rank-2 coarse structure of which 24-equal is<br/>one supporting EDO, and for which our generator should be a neutral<br/>third.</p><p>So what about harmony? Harmony is simple if you keep in mind that<br/>intervals that are &quot;tempered together&quot; should be taken to represent an<br/>equivalence class that maps intervals onto the same scale position and<br/>nothing else. It should NOT be taken as an impetus to find the POTE<br/>generator and deliberately mistune things to hit some neutral, blah,<br/>middle of the road intonation that removes all of the fun from maqam<br/>music. So start thinking in terms of JI dyads &quot;sharing an equivalence<br/>class&quot; or &quot;sharing a scale position&quot; rather than being &quot;mistuned<br/>together&quot; or something like that.</p><p>The short version: 36/35, 81/80, and 121/120 all define the basis for<br/>the temperament in the 11-limit, but you do everything adaptively<br/>instead of finding the POTE generator and playing on fixed pitch<br/>instruments. So 7/4 and 16/9 share an equivalence class in the scale,<br/>but there&apos;s no law forcing you to tune the minor sevenths to some<br/>middle of the road blase 990 cent tuning - if you&apos;re playing on a<br/>fretless instrument you can and should hit whatever specific<br/>intonation you want for any particular musical context. The fact that<br/>they &quot;vanish&quot; really means that they share an equivalence class with<br/>1/1, meaning that motion by that interval is heard as an intonational<br/>adjustment from the unison, rather than a melodic motion by step to<br/>another fundamentally different interval in the scale. The 13-limit<br/>version adds 144/143 as well, signifying that the generator could be<br/>taken as a 16/13 as well as an 11/9.</p><p>What this means:<br/>1) The neutral third is 11/9, and two of them get you to 3/2. This<br/>implies that 27/22 also shares the class. Again, you don&apos;t have to<br/>actually play two equal-sized neutral thirds, and you&apos;re free to make<br/>the generators unequal if you want, or change dynamically in size due<br/>to musical context, or not tune them strictly to JI at all.<br/>2) The minor third is split into two neutral seconds, which could be<br/>either 11/10 or 12/11, if you want, or anything in between. Whether<br/>you want to make them equal or follow the Byzantine law of attraction<br/>is up to you.<br/>3) The perfect fourths of maqam music are often somewhere around 4/3,<br/>but it&apos;s also sometimes seen that the minor sevenths are flattened to<br/>be closer to 7/4<br/>(<a href="http://launch.groups.yahoo.com/group/tuning/message/97031">http://launch.groups.yahoo.com/group/tuning/message/97031</a>). This<br/>means that both 16/9 and 7/4 might conceivably end up being played for<br/>the &quot;minor 7th&quot; interval within the same piece and hence both get<br/>mapped to -4 generators.<br/>4) As per the above analysis, the major thirds are sometimes close to<br/>5/4, but might be closer sometimes to the Pythagorean 81/64, and the<br/>minor third is supposed to be 6/5, but might sometimes be closer to<br/>32/27. 7/6 was observed in the above analysis of the Bashir phrase.<br/>I&apos;m not sure if 9/7 ever pops up, but technically, if you wanted to<br/>use it, it&apos;s there.<br/>5) For the 13-limit, the generator could be taken as/intoned as 16/13<br/>as well (or 39/32), and the middle seconds could be 13/12 or 14/13 as<br/>well.</p><p>AGAIN - This does not mean that no informational difference exists<br/>between 16/13 or 11/9 in maqam music, or that you have to make the<br/>neutral thirds equal, or that you have to stick to any sort of JI<br/>paradigm at all! It just means, quite literally, that these intervals<br/>are both types of &quot;neutral third,&quot; no more, no less. You can<br/>dynamically retune them to whatever you want. Also, the choice of<br/>intervals listed above as sharing an equivalence class aren&apos;t random<br/>and are consistent with the comma basis above.</p><p>Thus is the essence of maqam music to me - it treats lots of intervals<br/>as being intonational variants within the same equivalence class, is<br/>notated as such, but is strongly adaptive. The solution is to<br/>deliberately construct a temperament that is designed to be adaptive<br/>from the ground up, which we do by simply specifying how intervals map<br/>via the homomorphism and nothing else, even if it means &quot;tempering&quot; a<br/>comma like 36/35. It&apos;s a new way of thinking about temperaments, and I<br/>hope it&apos;ll reopen an exploration into adaptive JI.</p><p><a href="http://xenharmonic.wikispaces.com/Meantone+family#Maqamic">http://xenharmonic.wikispaces.com/Meantone+family#Maqamic</a></p><p>-Mike</p></div><h3>Mike Battaglia &#x3C;battaglia01@...&#x3E;</h3><span>9/3/2011 2:25:13 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>On Sat, Sep 3, 2011 at 4:53 AM, Mike Battaglia &lt;battaglia01@...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Thus is the essence of maqam music to me - it treats lots of intervals<br/>&gt; as being intonational variants within the same equivalence class, is<br/>&gt; notated as such, but is strongly adaptive.

All of the maqamat revolve around a certain<br/>scalar structure. In 24-EDO this structure implies a generator of<br/>7\24, and the maqamat are all MODMOS&apos;s of the 7 note MOS that results<br/>from the use of this generator. Once you analyze it like this, it<br/>becomes clear that 24-equal is only one of a number of EDOs that<br/>supports this scalar structure; other options include 17-EDO, 27-EDO,<br/>and 31-EDO.</p><p>If, on the other hand, you don&apos;t care about the neutral thirds being<br/>equal, then that implies a you&apos;re working within rank 3, with your<br/>generators being the 2/1, the 3/2, and some sort of neutral third, two<br/>of which don&apos;t make a 3/2. I started with the rank 2 case to keep it<br/>simple, and until we better understand rank 3 MOS it&apos;s going to be<br/>difficult to define. Maqamic temperament is the simplest harmonic<br/>mapping that yields that generator and which is consistent with some<br/>of the intonational choices made by maqam performers.</p><p>&gt; For me, the big issue in a lot of the maqam temperament research I have seen so far is to find a system adequate for fretted and other fixed-pitch instruments, the tradeoff between intonational accuracy and the not too high number of notes.</p><p>This temperament was designed with adaptive instruments in mind. For<br/>fixed-pitch instruments, which right now use 24-EDO, this is a bit<br/>more accurate than that. For a fixed pitch instrument that can<br/>adequately represent all of the intonational nuances in live maqam<br/>music, this temperament won&apos;t fit the bill and isn&apos;t supposed to.</p><p>The question of how to design a fixed pitch set to handle an adaptive<br/>temperament, which any temperament could theoretically be, is an<br/>interesting question. It could be very well modeled by a<br/>dimensionality increase of 1, with the extra generator being half the<br/>size of the &quot;average&quot; size comma in the kernel. The complexity of the<br/>primes should be taken into account as well.</p><p>&gt; But Margo, Ozan or Jacques can sure give more qualified input than I can...</p><p>I&apos;d love to hear Margo or Jacques weigh in. Oz doesn&apos;t hang round<br/>these parts anymore, but you can find him on Facebook.</p><p>It would be fun to analyze the data on regional maqam intonational<br/>practices as well. The whole thing might make sense as a rank 3<br/>temperament, with generators set to 2/1, 11/9, and some comma.</p><p>-Mike</p><p>--<br/>-Mike</p></div><h3>Valentine, Bob &#x3C;bob.valentine@...&#x3E;</h3><span>9/5/2011 2:08:08 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>I suppose saz are 17 out of 24 these days?<br/>---------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>Intel Israel (74) Limited</p><p>This e-mail and any attachments may contain confidential material for<br/>the sole use of the intended recipient(s).
