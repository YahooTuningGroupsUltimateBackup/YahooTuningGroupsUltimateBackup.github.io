On the<br/>theory they are used mostly for flat key signatures. So are easy to play<br/>then. The seven extra white keys are in front of the regular keys, below them<br/>slightly when the keyboard keys are depressed. That way one cne remove one&apos;s<br/>fingers from the keys toward one&apos;s body, as is often done (such as changing<br/>manuals), without striking the extra keys.</p><p>An extra white key between E-F and B-C lengthens the octave too much for most<br/>people tor each well. I tried having an extra white key the black-key width<br/>there, but that interferred with playing flat key signatures. I tried many<br/>ways, and setteled on the above as the best and most practical layout.</p><p>My regular metal-plastic keyboards I bought from a pipe-organ supply firm,<br/>Kimber-Allen, in Britain, when it had a distributor in the U. S. (The<br/>Diapason magazine  has ads from other organ-supply firms. Some will sell to<br/>individuals, others to only the treade.)</p><p>The B/W switches I bought from Mouser. I attached the switches to Vector-or<br/>Vector-type perforated boards from Digi-Key in MN with the terminals 90<br/>degrees to the front. I used perforated copper bus strips from Digi-Key along<br/>the front bottom edge for the plus voltage.</p><p>The back terminals have short copper strips to the back of the narrow boards,<br/>to which wires are attched that go to key-signature switch boards havign 61<br/>diode switches on them from Classic organs in AZ.</p><p>The wires from the key-signature switchboards go to the pitches on the tone<br/>generaotrs. To get the right pitches to the right notes I had to interlace<br/>the wires to the several tone generators.</p><p>Below manual one is a row of white digitals. Between manual one and two is a<br/>row of black digitals. Behind and slightly above them is another<br/>white-digital row. Between manuals two and three is the same as for manuals<br/>one and two. Above manual three is another black-digital row.</p><p>These key rows were made solid and straight by fastening to strips of iron<br/>used for wall shelving atop the black boards and between the black and white<br/>boards. for the double rosws I used plastic electricalvtape as insulation<br/>along the metal bar for the upper row..</p><p>I don&apos;t have any pix of my organ layout yet, as the organ isn&apos;t finished.</p><p>Sincerely,<br/>Pauline W.

Two key signatures an augmented 4th apart share the same 12<br/>split digitals, since two notes are identical.</p><p>Pauline</p></div>
