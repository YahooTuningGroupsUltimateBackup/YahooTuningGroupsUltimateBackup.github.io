The new samples are working and perhaps this will help<br/>anyone else who has had the same problem. I&apos;m very impressed with the<br/>urgency to attend to beginner&apos;s needs. Nice bunch, the C Sounders.</p><p>Alison,</p><p>The chapter 1 etudes use loscil.<br/>In the earlier version of Csound, loscil handled loop points<br/>a bit differently.  This is why the orcs worked when I edited<br/>the book and at the last minute, these same samples<br/>caused errors.</p><p>I have put together another set of samples for chapter 1<br/>that have loop points in them and work correctly with the<br/>version of Csound distributed with the first printing of the<br/>Csound Book.  (The second printing is coming.  New CDROMS.<br/>with many updates... and this is no longer a problem.)</p><p>For now.  You might install a newer version of Csound.<br/>or  get new samples from this url: <a href="http://csounds.com/catalog/index.html">http://csounds.com/catalog/index.html</a></p><p>You will find the samples in the &quot;support&quot; section of this page.</p><p>Hope this helps.</p><p>Dr.B.</p></div>
