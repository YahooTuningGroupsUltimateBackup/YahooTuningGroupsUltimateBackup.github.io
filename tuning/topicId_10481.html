You know,<br/>traditional major and minor chords in these scales sound like jazz!</p><p>However I have a few questions for Paul, or anybody else who&apos;s messed<br/>around with these scales.</p><p>First, why are almost all of them &quot;decatonic&quot; 10 notes.  Why does that<br/>work well for 22?  Why don&apos;t we use the full 22??</p><p>And, what does the terminology &quot;major&quot; and &quot;minor&quot; refer to in these<br/>scales... maybe I just have to work with them longer to hear it...</p><p>Is the point of the decatonic to make the traditional 7-limit interval<br/>the ultimate consonance... the C to Bb being the octave in this case.</p><p>Of course, in Paul&apos;s article, one idea of these scales is to make<br/>7-limit consonances work nicely.  Of course this is totally unrelated to<br/>the Indian music which used similar intervals, or at least 22 notes in<br/>an octave, yes?</p><p>And aren&apos;t we talking about 10 notes in an octave, not 22??</p><p>Well... it&apos;s fun to play anyway.  Nice for some pieces...</p><p>____________ ____ __ __ _<br/>Joseph Pehrson</p></div>
