I&apos;ll<br/>chime in and say that as a guitarist and poor site reader and<br/>poor pianist, I would rather have the &quot;C&quot; option. Thats generally<br/>a &quot;base of operations&quot; that is nice to have.</p><p>Regarding tuning of a blackjack guitar, as a jazz guitarist, it<br/>is a rare moment when I get a ton of use of open strings (it<br/>is much more frequent in classical guitar). So if only three<br/>open strings are in the scale, and/or scordatura (?) is used to<br/>increase that for classical guitar it doesn&apos;t seem to be a big<br/>deal. But I also still see blackjack (canasta, et al) as<br/>subsets of parent ets and hence transposable to any position<br/>in the parent et. Paul or Dave, who have worked on partially<br/>filled fretboards might have a compelling idea for something<br/>different, though historically, we have transposing instruments<br/>so that even if it is built in an awkward concert key, performers<br/>can have an easy-to-read key.</p><p>Bob Valentine</p></div>
