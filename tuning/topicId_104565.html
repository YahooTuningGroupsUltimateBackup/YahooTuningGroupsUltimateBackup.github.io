It&apos;s called &quot;Mode/solve&quot; and it can be used in the cases when the number of pure intervals equals the number of single-step sizes in the scale. Although it can be used on lots of weird temperaments as well, I&apos;d like to give some pretty conventional examples to make it all easily understandable.</p><p>Let&apos;s say that we want to get a 12-tone scale of 2 different sizes of semitone, one of which will function as a minor second and the other will function as a chroma. Now we wish, for example, that octaves were pure and that augmented seconds were tuned to 6/5. In fact, we&apos;re requiring 7 minor seconds plus 5 chromas to make a 2/1 and also 1 minor second plus 2 chromas to make 6/5. Therefore, we do the following:<br/>First, we store our list of desired intervals as a scale into one of Scala&apos;s memories using the &quot;Input/line&quot; command. For example, by typing &quot;Input/line 1&quot; on one line and &quot;6/5 2/1&quot; on the next one, we store our target intervals into scale memory #1.<br/>Now we type &quot;Mode/solve 1&quot; and we&apos;re asked to enter a pattern for our 12-tone scale. If we label minor seconds as &quot;1&quot; and chromas and &quot;2&quot;, then, for instance, a scale from C upwards with sharps only is expressed as &quot;2 1 2 1 1 2 1 2 1 2 1 1&quot;, which is what we enter as the pattern.<br/>Now we&apos;re asked to enter the step counts that should add up to 6/5 (which are 1 and 2, respectively) and 2/1 (which are 7 and 5), each on a separate line, making it a sequence of 5 lines (one for the pattern, four for the counts). So the full command sequence is then:<br/>Input/line 1<br/>6/5 2/1<br/>Mode/solve 1<br/>2 1 2 1 1 2 1 2 1 2 1 1<br/>1<br/>2<br/>7<br/>5<br/>As a result, we get a 12-tone chain of 1/9-schisma helmholtz/grovenian temperament ranging from F to A#.</p><p>As our next example, suppose we want a 12-tone scale of some meantone temperament whose major and minor thirds are even closer to pure than in 2/7-comma. One such possible solution may be achieved by tuning major and minor tenths to exactly 5/2 and 12/5, respectively, which therefore makes 25/24 also pure as well as 6/1. This in turn results in stratched octaves, which can be a good solution in some situations just because of this particular fact (if we don&apos;t want pure octaves). And let&apos;s assume we want a scale with sharps only, similarly to the previous example. So we can enter something like this:<br/>Input/line 1<br/>25/24 5/2<br/>Mode/solve 1<br/>2 1 2 1 1 2 1 2 1 2 1 1<br/>0<br/>1<br/>9<br/>7</p><p>Now, obviously, this command is not limited to 2D temperaments. So maybe one day we&apos;ll be exploring temperaments like ragismatic in scales using three single-step sizes, who knows? :-)</p><p>So, happy &quot;more-than-rank-1-tempering&quot;.</p><p>Petr</p></div><h3>genewardsmith &#x3C;genewardsmith@...&#x3E;</h3><span>5/11/2012 9:31:09 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, Petr Pa&angst;Â™&Atilde;&shy;zek &lt;petrparizek2000@...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Hi tuners.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; After some offlist communication with Manuel, I&apos;d like to let you know that<br/>&gt; the most recent version of Scala has a new command very appropriate for all<br/>&gt; of us who have ever done something with &quot;more than rank 1&quot; temperaments.</p><p>I don&apos;t see any explanation of where your interval pattern comes from, and how you know it works.</p></div><h3>Petr Par&#xED;zek &#x3C;petrparizek2000@...&#x3E;</h3><span>5/11/2012 2:08:41 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Gene wrote:</p><p>&gt; I don&apos;t see any explanation of where your interval pattern comes from, and &gt; how you know it works.</p><p>If I want to make a scale of 7x+5y to an octave (without initially knowing whether x is larger than y or vice versa), I may easily convert the scale to standard notation and view it as 7 minor seconds + 5 chromas.
