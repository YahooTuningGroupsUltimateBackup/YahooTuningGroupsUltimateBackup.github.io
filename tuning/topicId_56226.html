The console can be painlessly<br/>  &gt;hidden from view when not needed. The device is easily installed and<br/>  &gt;can be removed on demand. It silently employs the pressure required<br/>  &gt;to increase or decrease the tension of the strings within an<br/>  &gt;acceptable safe range of operation. For those who wonder how it does<br/>  &gt;that, I can only tell you that the mechanism has nothing to do<br/>  &gt;with the metallic pegs holding the strings in tension.</p><p>  Sounds fascinating!</p><p>  &gt;I regret to inform you, however, that the realization of the<br/>  &gt;completed design of the Ultratonal Piano project requires considerable<br/>  &gt;financial contributions before we can even come up with a prototype.<br/>  &gt;If the costs are met, we wish to manufacture both the mechanical and<br/>  &gt;the electronic versions of it.</p><p>  Hi Ozan,</p><p>  I remember the fateful day, when I realized the World is not<br/>  held up on a shortage of ideas, but rather a shortage of money!<br/>  On the other hand, it is said that any amount of money can be<br/>  raised with the right PowerPoint presentation.  :)</p><p>  -Carl</p></div><h3><a id=56250 href="#56250">ðŸ”—</a>Carl Lumma &#x3C;ekin@lumma.org&#x3E;</h3><span>11/15/2004 1:06:44 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Dear Carl,</p><p>&gt;I&apos;m pleased to have received such a prompt reply from you.
