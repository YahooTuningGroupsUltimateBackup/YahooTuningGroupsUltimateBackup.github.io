It&apos;s been an exciting coupla days!

I can almost hear Bach&apos;s notes over the incessant<br/>&gt;humming/moaning.</p><p>Har!  That&apos;s a funny recording, all right!  I actually wrote CBS about<br/>it many years ago and got a courteous response (I asked where I could<br/>buy the &quot;non-singing&quot; version; they regretfully informed me that there<br/>wasn&apos;t one...).  (Of course, I knew there wasn&apos;t one; I was just<br/>twisting their corporate tail...  Nobody, it seems, could stop GG from<br/>singing, especially later in his life.).</p><p>[Kraig Grady, TD 428.10:]<br/>&gt;I believe Stravinsky complained bitterly about the changing of his<br/>&gt;music in Fantasia and i remember he included the &quot;blackmail&quot; letter<br/>&gt;from Walt himself telling him his copywrights meant nothing in the U.S.</p><p>Dang!  I suppose this means I shouldn&apos;t post the killer &quot;Rite of Spring&quot;<br/>piano reduction I got from a list member!  Sounds like ol&apos; Walt was<br/>acting like a jerk...  I do think that, while a composer is alive, it is<br/>fair to grant full legal control over his/her work; if this is not being<br/>done now, I would support changes.  After a composer&apos;s death (and<br/>separate expiration of works&apos; copyrights), I think it&apos;s reasonable to<br/>throw the game wide open.  Let time weed out the crap; it does have a<br/>way of doing so!!!</p><p>[JdL:]<br/>&gt;&gt;A while back there was a controversy concerning Harry Partch and the<br/>&gt;&gt;Kronos Quartet.  Even then I tended to side with the quartet,</p><p>[Kraig:]<br/>&gt;them ur thar fightin wurds, mistar</p><p>Yeah, I&apos;ve already been beat up on that one!  I ain&apos;t tryin&apos; to re-open<br/>it!!</p><p>[Kraig:]<br/>&gt;Follow you vision then!!!!!!! we could go back and forth forever on<br/>&gt;this, at least you are aware as to how a composer might think that&apos;s<br/>&gt;all!</p><p>Sure.  My quibble has to do with whether the boys of the past felt this<br/>way; we&apos;ll see what the historical experts tell us on that one!</p><p>Thanks to all the list members, too many to mention (from memory,<br/>anyway!) who make me feel that I&apos;m not standing all alone!  Many of you<br/>offered not just unqualified support, but what might be called<br/>&quot;thoughtful support&quot;, highlighting important facets of the issues, and<br/>bringing forth legitimate cautions.  Thanks so much to all of you!!</p><p>Johnny, I just bought a statue of you, and I&apos;m fixing the nose - it was<br/>WAY too small...</p><p>JdL</p></div><h3><a id=6766 href="#6766">ðŸ”—</a>David Beardsley &#x3C;xouoxno@xxxx.xxxx&#x3E;</h3><span>12/8/1999 11:53:41 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>&quot;John A. deLaubenfels&quot; wrote:</p><p>&gt; [David Beardsley, TD 427.23:]<br/>&gt; &gt;I&apos;ve got to agree with KG here: do something new folks!<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Please be sure to keep me posted about when the vote comes up for what<br/>&gt; YOUR next project will be, David; I don&apos;t want to miss casting mine! ;^&gt;</p><p>In the real near future, there&apos;s probably going to<br/>be live microtonal guitar netcast.</p><p>I don&apos;t have any gigs scheduled right now,<br/>but I should have a CD-R ready sometime in<br/>January so I can start getting some together<br/>in 2000.</p><p>&gt; [Kraig Grady, TD 428.10:]<br/>&gt; &gt;I believe Stravinsky complained bitterly about the changing of his<br/>&gt; &gt;music in Fantasia and i remember he included the &quot;blackmail&quot; letter<br/>&gt; &gt;from Walt himself telling him his copywrights meant nothing in the U.S.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Dang!

I find myself aligned<br/>with Jon, Daniel, Kraig, and others that raise alarm at too much, or<br/>ill-advised tinkering.  Believe me, this is as unlikely a bunch of<br/>bed-fellows as I can imagine on this list.</p><p>You seem to see the composition as existing only in its set of directions<br/>through music notation.  Not true and my metaphor still stands about sculpted<br/>work.  I don&apos;t feel you have the right to call it my sculpture if you alter<br/>it before an exhibition...even if you own it.  Sorry if this burdensome for<br/>you.  You can still legally do any kind of changing and rearranging you want.<br/> Since it&apos;s my line of work, the presentation of previously unperformable<br/>scores, I thought my opinion might be of some interest to you on this<br/>subject.</p><p>The integrity of my compositions are threatened by those that don&apos;t see the<br/>true designs which are often buried within a piece.   I say the above<br/>foremost as an interpreter, but with the approval of the composer inside.<br/>The producer in me wouldn&apos;t have it any other way.</p><p>Johnny Reinhard<br/>AFMM</p></div>
