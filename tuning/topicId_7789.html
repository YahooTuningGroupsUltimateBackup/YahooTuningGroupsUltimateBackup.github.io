Though acoustic instruments give a sort of sound<br/>&gt; that electronic ones cannot.  But none of this invalidates my<br/>&gt; application<br/>&gt; of things I noticed on a DS keyboard to MIDI keyboard designs.</p><p>The number of notes you can reach with one hand is far more important if<br/>you&apos;re playing live than recording each part to a sequencer.  And having<br/>interchangeable keyboard mappings means each needn&apos;t be as useful on its<br/>own as if that were all you had.  If a keyboard&apos;s cheap, it doesn&apos;t matter<br/>so much if it&apos;s useless for most music.</p><p>&gt; &gt;Yes, but think of what you&apos;d be giving up by *not* having such a<br/>&gt; &gt;keyboard/mapping!  You can&apos;t sit down and play a few different<br/>&gt; &gt;permutations of diminished chords to see which best fits the<br/>&gt; progression.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; What&apos;s that??</p><p>A diminished triad contains two minor thirds.  Either could be subminor,<br/>and with the right keyboard you can try all three versions to see which<br/>you want.  And do that really easily.</p><p>&gt; &gt;You can&apos;t be playing simple chords, and decide to throw in a sharpened<br/>&gt; &gt;third on a whim.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; On an octave-reachable Bosanquet, sure.</p><p>Sure, if you&apos;ve got one.</p><p>&gt; &gt;Unless you&apos;re a dab hand with a pitch wheel, you can&apos;t play a melody<br/>&gt; &gt;teasingly out of tune with the accompaniment.  Compared with all this,<br/>&gt; your<br/>&gt; &gt;objections seem so arbitrary.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Caring about what voicings I can reach is arbitrary?</p><p>Insisting on reaching an octave with one hand is arbitrary.</p><p>&gt; Please don&apos;t take my use of &quot;serious&quot; too seriously.  I&apos;m talking for me<br/>&gt; more than you or anybody else.  Remember, I said one could spend a<br/>&gt; lifetime<br/>&gt; playing cool music on something like your schismic halberstadt mapping.<br/>&gt; It&apos;s just not something I&apos;m interested in.</p><p>You can play cool music on a bad instrument.  My contention is that<br/>extended mappings allow you to do cool things that wouldn&apos;t otherwise be<br/>possible.  And if you&apos;re interested in the right scales, it may be worth<br/>rebuilding a keyboard to make them work better.  So long as that&apos;s<br/>understood, no problem.</p></div>
