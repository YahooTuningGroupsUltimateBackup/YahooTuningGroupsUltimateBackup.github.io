They are FULLY implemented by the relationships.<br/>Just because they don&apos;t use all the microtonal relationships doesn&apos;t<br/>mean it isn&apos;t implemented.</p><p>That&apos;s just like saying that because Julia doesn&apos;t use just<br/>intonation in *her* musical relationships with 72-tET then *her*<br/>music isn&apos;t &quot;fully implemented.&quot;</p><p>I would never say that, because it would be ridiculous outside of the<br/>artistic implementation.</p><p>There is a serious flaw in the logic here, as far as *I* am concerned!</p><p>Joseph</p></div>
