This was<br/>by far the part of my paper that I banged my head against the most,<br/>mainly in my senior year and then again a couple of years later,<br/>before it &quot;crystallized&quot;.</p><p>The key concept for understanding the &quot;dynamic&quot; modes is<br/>the &quot;characteristic dissonance&quot;. This is a rare dissonant interval<br/>which is the same number of scale steps as a common consonant<br/>interval. By common I mean &quot;almost everywhere&quot;. So in the diatonic<br/>scale, the tritone is the characteristic interval. In the &quot;dynamic&quot;<br/>modes, the characteristic dissonance is disjoint from (has no notes<br/>in common with) the tonic N-ad, a complete chord of the N*2 - 1<br/>limit. For example, in the diatonic scale, the only modes in which<br/>the tritone is disjoint from the tonic triad are the ionian<br/>(=&quot;major&quot;) and aeolian (=&quot;natural minor&quot;) modes. You get &quot;strong<br/>tonality&quot; when the characteristic dissonance resolves by contrary<br/>motion through steps of the rarest step size to two notes of the<br/>tonic N-ad. The ionian/major and aeolian/minor modes are<br/>thus &quot;strongly tonal&quot; modes . . . and they pretty much<br/>define &quot;tonality&quot; as we know it. When neither of the two notes of the<br/>tonic N-ad being resolved to is the tonic note itself, one may need<br/>special means to point to that note in order that the other two notes<br/>don&apos;t imply some other tonic N-ad. In the diatonic case, this is why<br/>we have the harmonic minor . . . otherwise minor tonality would<br/>dissolve to easily into the relative major.</p><p>The &quot;static&quot; modes are modes in which the tonic N-ad, a complete<br/>chord of the N*2 - 1 limit, can be extended to an N+1-ad, a complete<br/>chord of the N*2 + 1 limit. For example, if you accept 12-tone equal<br/>temperament&apos;s 7-limit approximations, the mixolydian mode and the<br/>dorian mode are the examples . . . since the tonic major chord in the<br/>mixolydian mode can be completed into an approximate 4:5:6:7 . . .<br/>and utonally for the dorian mode. Note that a huge percentage<br/>of &quot;static&quot;, &quot;modal&quot; improvised rock and jazz-rock music is in these<br/>two modes.</p><p>I&apos;ve found lots of loose interpretations of these rules useful when<br/>working with various scales. If there aren&apos;t a lot of consonant<br/>intervals in the scale, even a single 3:2 will define a point of<br/>relative &quot;stability&quot; -- the tonic being the note representing the<br/>number 2 in the ratio 3:2. And even this can be subverted in many<br/>styles of composition . . .</p></div><h3><a id=24273 href="#24273">ðŸ”—</a>D.Stearns &#x3C;STEARNS@CAPECOD.NET&#x3E;</h3><span>6/2/2001 11:26:10 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Paul and Jon W.,</p><p>Thanks for the replies, I&apos;m going to take a better look at both of<br/>them over the weekend.</p><p>One thing I had looked at before was using something like the average,<br/>or arithmetic mean of the rotations in cents and looking for the<br/>closest match to P/2 (or perhaps the &quot;skewness&quot;, the degree of<br/>asymmetry around the mean, where the best match is closest to zero).</p><p>The idea being that this would give the most palindromic rotation (or<br/>rotations) thereby theoretically giving something like a generalized<br/>dorian mode.
