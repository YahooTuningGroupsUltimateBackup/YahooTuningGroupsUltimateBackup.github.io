Yes, fully symmetric ttritones<br/>appear only in even-number EDOs. And fully-symmetric diminshed seventh<br/>chords appear only in EDOs where the number of pitches is a multiple<br/>of 4, and fully symmetric augmented triads  appear only in EDOs where<br/>the number of pitches is a multiple of 3 - and so on! Symmetrical<br/>chords are very good for modulations. And 12, as a relatively low<br/>number with an exceptional high number of divisors, is indeed quite a<br/>good choice in this aspect.<br/>OTOH, if you want something like a non-symmetrical whole-tone scale,<br/>an odd-number EDO is needed.</p><p>&gt; 2.
