As far as I can tell the most<br/>important aspect is getting reliable information on how musicians actually<br/>tune their instruments.  Music theory in other countries is no more (and<br/>probably less) reliable than music theory in the West.</p><p>&gt;There is no clear consensus on this yet, altho I recall Pauls<br/>&gt;Erlich and Hahn being the most outspoken in favor of the one(s?)<br/>&gt;they like, and doesn&apos;t Carl Lumma agree, at least partially?</p><p>First, you have to decide what you want to measure.  Psychoacoustic<br/>consonance?  If so, the lattice really isn&apos;t of much use, since consonance<br/>has little or nothing to do with factoring.  However, Paul E. does seem to<br/>consider his metric a lattice metric.  He only recognizes factoring by 2&apos;s,<br/>so he&apos;s got a lattice dimension for every odd factor, to odd-limit<br/>infinity.  Because he uses a triangular lattice, every ratio has an<br/>octave-equivalent representation that spans one rung.  So his metric is<br/>simply the log of the odd limit of the ratio.  Why log, I don&apos;t know.  The<br/>only advantage of using logs that I ever understood was that it unifies the<br/>results of odd and prime limit factorizations, which shouldn&apos;t matter to<br/>Paul E, given his stance on prime numbers in consonance measures.  Last I<br/>heard, Paul E. was considering switching to an octave-specific rectangular<br/>lattice; perhaps he can update us on the pro&apos;s and con&apos;s of such a thing.</p><p>Or, you could measure the modulation distance (Paul H, if you can think of<br/>a better way to explain this...), so to speak, of an interval.  In this<br/>approach, factoring is important.  First, you declare which intervals you<br/>consider consonant, and you give lattice dimensions only to the identities<br/>needed.  Then you count the number of rungs (each of which are defined as<br/>consonant) along the shortest route to the target interval.  In effect, you<br/>are counting the number of common-tone modulations (by consonances) you<br/>need to get to the interval.  Paul Hahn uses this metric in his diameter<br/>and consistency measurements.</p><p>-C.</p></div><h3><a id=5057 href="#5057">ðŸ”—</a>Paul H.

For working with Fokker periodicity blocks, octave-equivalence<br/>is essential. If you&apos;re doing something in an octave-specific context,<br/>though, I see nothing wrong with n*d as a complexity measure, therefore<br/>Tenney&apos;s rectangular lattice, where the distance between rungs is the log of<br/>the prime number along whose axis you&apos;re moving, could work well for<br/>octave-specific complexity (the convenience of only having prime axes is<br/>much appreciated here).</p><p>&gt;Or, you could measure the modulation distance (Paul H, if you can think of<br/>&gt;a better way to explain this...), so to speak, of an interval.

Paul Hahn uses this metric in his diameter<br/>&gt;and consistency measurements.</p><p>This is what I would use if the musical context operates under a given<br/>overall odd-limit of consonance (as Paul Hahn assumes). I would weight the<br/>consonances by the log of their odd-limits (note the two different meanings<br/>of odd-limit here). When the overall odd-limit goes to infinity, you get the<br/>thing you were talking about at the top of this message.</p><p>I should point out that by &quot;factoring&quot; above you don&apos;t mean anything like<br/>prime factorization.</p><p>The 3-d lattices I&apos;ve been drawing can be said to conform with this last<br/>option, with 7 as the overall odd limit.
