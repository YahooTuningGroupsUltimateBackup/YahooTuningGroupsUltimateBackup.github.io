There are many helpful people here who<br/>&gt;will come to the fore to assist... I see they already have.<br/>&gt;<br/>    yepyep, I unsubscribed awhile ago for reasons best not discussed amongst<br/>near total strangers. . .</p><p>&gt;Paul Erlich is certainly right about my own case.  Although I know it<br/>&gt;has seemed like years to some, I actually have been on this list for<br/>&gt;little more than 6 months!!  It&apos;s amazing the amount I have learned in<br/>&gt;that period of time... some of it TOTALLY transforming my music!  You<br/>&gt;will regret leaving!<br/>&gt;<br/>    okay okay I regret I regret</p><p>&gt;And Paul Erlich wrote in TD 683:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt; Judith, I&apos;m glad you spoke up, I too am a musician and I believe<br/>&gt;&gt; music should be the true focus of this list, and have offered more<br/>&gt;&gt; than once to take the math-oriented discussions onto a separate list<br/>&gt;&gt; to avoid scaring away musicians who are less math oriented.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;Oh... this is a terrible idea.  Just horrible.  Awful.  And did I<br/>&gt;mention that it really is a bad idea??<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;I would hate that.  Part of the &quot;fun&quot; is reading through articles I<br/>&gt;can&apos;t understand... NB ADAM BUSHELL... sometimes I FINALLY DO understand<br/>&gt;them!!  The stuff &quot;seeps in&quot; eventually... or some of it does.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;If I understand everything on the list and know totally what&apos;s going<br/>&gt;on... what&apos;s the point in reading it??<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;I admit there should be a RANGE of articles... but I think many of us<br/>&gt;have been presenting those of late.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;And if people think the HEXANYS are just arcane math, get ye to<br/>&gt;Anaphoria and waft the airwaves there!  These patterns are beautiful,<br/>&gt;visually and in sound.  There is nothing &quot;arcane&quot; about any of this from<br/>&gt;an artistic standpoint, and one doesn&apos;t have to understand all the<br/>&gt;arithmetic behind it in order to enjoy the beauties!<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt; So even if the math-oriented material were on a separate list, we&apos;d<br/>&gt;&gt; probably come back to this list often to report our findings,<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;Did I ever say that this would be a terrible idea???<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;______________ _____ ___ __ _<br/>&gt;</p><p>    I agree with everything Joseph Pehrson has written in the above quote.</p><p>    Thanks.</p><p>    zHANg</p></div>
