It seems useful to have four broad categories describing equal<br/>division tunings. The following have been proposed or are in common<br/>use:</p><p>EDI- equal division of an interval, contains the following:<br/>EDO- equal division of the octave<br/>ET- equal temperament, an EDO close to a set of just intervals</p><p>These seem reasonable to me. I intend to use them consistently unless<br/>reasonable objections are raised. I think there is nothing wrong with<br/>defining new terminology or redefining old terms when it is apparent that<br/>they have become restrictive. We are in a unique position to clarify the<br/>subject, simply because we care enough about it to discuss improvements.<br/>If we agree on and use consistent terminology, it is likely that the rest<br/>of the world will follow.</p><p>John Starrett<br/><a href="http://www-math.cudenver.edu/~jstarret/microtone.html">http://www-math.cudenver.edu/~jstarret/microtone.html</a></p></div><h3>Carl Lumma &#x3C;clumma@xxx.xxxx&#x3E;</h3><span>12/30/1999 8:01:13 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>&gt;That anyone else would think it were anything worth looking at at all<br/>&gt;probably only speaks to the fact that there is some degree of<br/>&gt;dissatisfaction afloat with some elements of some standard tuning<br/>&gt;terminology.</p><p>There is a great deal of dissatisfaction, and rightfully so.  But the terms<br/>I&apos;m concerned with aren&apos;t &quot;temperament&quot; or &quot;microtone&quot;.  I&apos;m much more<br/>concerned with &quot;mode&quot;, &quot;5th&quot;, &quot;JI&quot;, etc.  We recently won a great victory<br/>with &quot;adaptive&quot; and &quot;strict&quot; JI.</p><p>&gt;&gt;Use your own funky terms if you want, but why insist that somebody<br/>&gt;&gt;else does too?

The subject matter (and importance<br/>of it) may be entirely different (and in truth I tend to agree with<br/>you when you say, &quot;what we have works&quot; here, and I&apos;m actually fairly<br/>ambivalent about the whole idea of precision terminology, or at least<br/>don&apos;t see it as being all that terribly important), but your<br/>&apos;position&apos; or &apos;argument&apos; or &apos;mindset&apos; here is one that I have indeed<br/>heard again and again when attempting to pitch the *possible* virtues<br/>of microtonality to those who don&apos;t happen to see any need for it<br/>whatsoever... the upshot being &quot;indulge in whatever funky whatever you<br/>want, just don&apos;t bore me with it &apos;cause what I got ain&apos;t broke, and if<br/>it ain&apos;t broke...&quot;</p><p>Mr. Kludgy</p></div><h3>Carl Lumma &#x3C;clumma@xxx.xxxx&#x3E;</h3><span>12/30/1999 1:52:35 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>[Mr. Kludgy]<br/>&gt;&gt;Give me a break.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;Apparently you don&apos;t think so, &apos;ey?</p><p>No, I don&apos;t.

Mode is used to mean circular permutation, and<br/>subset.  I suggest it only mean circular permutation, and that is the only<br/>way I use it.  I use subset for subset.  5th is used to mean the 5th degree<br/>of a scale, and any approximate 3/2.  I only use it to mean 5th degree; I<br/>use 3/2 to mean 3/2.  I&apos;ve been over the JI thing many, many times.<br/>Another important concern is differentiating intervals from pitches.  The<br/>excellent suggestion of using : and / was made here some months back.  As<br/>recent event show, I need to be more careful about this one.</p><p>[John Starrett]<br/>&gt;I believe that there is something broke here, and that is a<br/>&gt;consistent accurate shorthand for different tuning classes. All<br/>&gt;suggestions are welcome.</p><p>See TD 464.4 for my suggestions.  Something&apos;s broke, alright.  EDO?  So 14<br/>EDO is the 14th equal division of the octave?  Putting the troubles of<br/>&quot;octave&quot; aside, what is the 14th division?  Attack!  Fall back and re-group!</p><p>-Carl</p></div><h3>D.Stearns &#x3C;stearns@xxxxxxx.xxxx&#x3E;</h3><span>12/30/1999 5:34:49 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>[Carl Lumma:]<br/>&gt;I gave good reasons for my views,</p><p>I would think that most everyone would say the same... no?</p><p>&gt;and an alternative to your kludgy terminology</p><p>Why thank you!

I mean, if someone lists the<br/>modes in 12-tET, they are simply listing the scales in 12-tET but with<br/>circular permutations differentiated.
