In it he<br/>&gt; proposed that gravity is not a force but a curved field in the space-time<br/>&gt; continuum that is created by the presence of mass. People were astonished by the fact<br/>&gt; that space and time are under relativity. Even though, the world could stay<br/>&gt; ease within the determinism where there was a general algorithmic procedure<br/>&gt; for resolving all mathematical questions.<br/>&gt; But since Heisenberg&apos;s discovery, Isaac Newton&apos;s laws of motion has not been<br/>&gt; used to predict accurately the behavior of single subatomic particles. The<br/>&gt; world was then suffered from this uncertainty. Godel gave an additional blow<br/>&gt; to the people&apos;s mental world with the incompleteness.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Relativity, Uncertainty and Incompleteness!<br/>&gt; Wow! We are free from the determinism!<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt; Roger Penrose, Professor of Mathematics at Oxford University and a<br/>&gt;&gt; physicist, now happily says, &quot;We cannot create any kind of new artistic<br/>&gt;&gt; sensitivity however we may accumulate many times of calculations. Art is a<br/>&gt;&gt; non-computable physics.&quot;<br/>&gt;&gt; I would like to say, &quot;Music is a non-computable physics, too&quot;.</p><p>&gt; But over the centuries musicians, mathematicians, theorists, thinkers,<br/>&gt; experts and amateurs have been suffered from the comma which is the difference<br/>&gt; between a perfectly tuned octave and the octave resulting from a tuned circle<br/>&gt; of fifths. Many great people have been trying to create the perfect scale in<br/>&gt; vain. Mathematics easily proves that perfection is not possible. Any solution<br/>&gt; does not exist. Musicians, especially pianists, have been accused of using<br/>&gt; the Equal Temperament for thier pianos because the Equal Temperament is said to<br/>&gt; be an anti-musical compromise which leaves each key equally damaged and none<br/>&gt; perfectly in tune.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; This comma has put a curse on music.<br/>&gt;<br/><a href="http://www.geocities.jp/imyfujita/wtcuncertain.html">http://www.geocities.jp/imyfujita/wtcuncertain.html</a></p></div><h3><a id=70128 href="#70128">ðŸ”—</a>Keenan Pepper &#x3C;keenanpepper@gmail.com&#x3E;</h3><span>3/1/2007 8:52:05 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>On 3/1/07, <a href="mailto:Mocfujita@aol.com">Mocfujita@aol.com</a> &lt;<a href="mailto:Mocfujita@aol.com">Mocfujita@aol.com</a>&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;  But since Heisenberg&apos;s discovery, Isaac Newton&apos;s laws of motion has not been used to predict accurately the behavior of single subatomic particles.
