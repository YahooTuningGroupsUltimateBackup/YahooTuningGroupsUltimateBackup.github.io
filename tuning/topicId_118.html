I therefore ask you for your opinion on these questions, for<br/>reposting to said newsgroup.</p><p>1. As a music theorist, what math do you use frequently?<br/>2. Is there some branch of mathematics that you wish you had studied?<br/>3. If  you could advise a student to take one specific math course to<br/>prepare her for a career in performance, what would it be, if any?<br/>4. What do you think is the minimum math required for a career as a music<br/>theorist?<br/>5. Should musicians or theorists take math from the mathematics<br/>department, or would they be better served learning the math that they<br/>need from their music professors as they need it?</p><p>John Starrett<br/><a href="http://www-math.cudenver.edu/~jstarret">http://www-math.cudenver.edu/~jstarret</a></p></div>
