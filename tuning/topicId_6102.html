I think it is helpful (as I was<br/>just explaining to Jim Savage) to look at all the intervals within the chord<br/>-- looking at just the ratios relative to the root obscures what is<br/>happening wih all the other intervals. Perhaps (3) is most consonant by<br/>Sethares/Plomp measures while (1) wins in terms of harmonic entropy.</p></div>
