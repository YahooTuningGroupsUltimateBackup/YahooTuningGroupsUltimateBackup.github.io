Hence it is highest (or lowest) at the moment of the attack, and<br/>smoothly declines (or ascends) from there. There is no one frequency that is<br/>emphasized by this effect, particularly since you will attack your Rhodes or<br/>bass slightly differently for each note.</p><p>-Paul</p></div><h3>David Beardsley &#x3C;xouoxno@virtulink.com&#x3E;</h3><span>11/6/2000 10:07:36 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Thanks Graham &amp; Paul for your thoughts.
