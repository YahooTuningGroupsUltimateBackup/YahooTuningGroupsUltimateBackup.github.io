I got them as non-commercial imports from<br/>a guy who seemed to know what was worthwhile, and they&apos;ve<br/>remained firm favourites ever since - going on 40 years!<br/>I still go around singing -<br/> &quot;The wall on which the prophets wrote<br/> is cracking at the seams ...<br/> ...<br/> Confusion will be my epitaph,<br/> As I crawl a cracked and broken path ...&quot;<br/>from time to time (particularly after reading another<br/>digest on tuning-math! ... :-) )  Great lyrics that stick in<br/>the mind, and perfectly set.</p><p>Unfortunately, my supplier moved away, and so I never<br/>did get to hear anything later by KC.  But all this<br/>discussion of &quot;Lark&apos;s Tongues in Aspic&quot; and &quot;Beat&quot; tells<br/>me I&apos;d better start looking again ...  More Fripp! :-)</p><p>---</p><p>As to playing 12-et on a fretless - every classical string<br/>player - eg violinists, cellists -  is pretty good at it!<br/>I&apos;ve also had fun trying to play my pi-pa, held in guitar<br/>position, finger-style ...</p><p>Regards,<br/>Yahya</p><p>-----Original Message-----<br/>________________________________________________________________________<br/>   Date: Mon, 04 Apr 2005 06:44:57 -0400<br/>   From: Dave Seidel<br/>Subject: Re: Re: King Crimson: Larks&apos; Tongues in Aspic</p><p>Belew plays some fretless on the album Beat, I believe (e.g., the tune<br/>Heartbeat).</p><p>A fretless commercially-made guitar that I&apos;ve tried that I&apos;d love to own<br/>is the Godin Glissentar (11 nylon strings, all doubled except for the<br/>lowest string).</p><p>- Dave</p><p>David Beardsley wrote:<br/>&gt; Yep.
