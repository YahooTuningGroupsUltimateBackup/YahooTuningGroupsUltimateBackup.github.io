Your choice of people to play your music might be every bit as<br/>important as which instruments you choose to write for.  All instruments can<br/>play quartertones, though brass do better with an extra piston or valve.  2<br/>pianos a quartertone apart is an old idea, but it is tough to find matched<br/>pianos.  And keep away from Steinway pianos since they don&apos;t hold a full<br/>quartertone below A=440.</p><p>Now if you write for bassoon, no problem.  Seriously.  (And any other string<br/>or woodwind.)  Percussion may need to be built, other than timpani.</p><p>As for an audience...it&apos;s all about growth.  Good luck on your adventures.</p><p>best, Johnny Reinhard<br/>Director<br/>American Festival of Microtonal Music</p></div>
