This is to keep them commensurate with the<br/>&gt;odd-limit or prime-limit where the max value is taken.<br/>-----------------------------------------<br/>Some years ago I discovered that the product of the numerator and<br/>denominator of any ratio (in its Canonic form) is straight related with<br/>the Rameau Fundamental Bass concept I called this product Indice<br/>Armonico (I avoid the Spanish accents because the ASCII symbols<br/>not works well everywhere) and was systematized for my purposes.<br/>This figure is the number of the harmonic (related with the Rameau Bass)</p><p>that is in common with some specific harmonic of the notes.<br/>For example, if we consider two notes with an interval of 5/4 each<br/>other,  if the Rameau Bass is 1 (one) the lowest note is its 4th<br/>harmonic, the upper one is its 5th and 20 is the harmonic of the Rameau<br/>bass in common with both notes.<br/>20 ((20 x 1)) is also (or has the same frequency) the 5th harmonic of<br/>the<br/>lowest note ((4 x 5))  and the 4th of the upper one ((5 x 4)).<br/>------------------------------------<br/>This concept is related with &quot;solid&quot; physics. I know this point of view<br/>is weak but the Differential Sound of both notes is ((5 - 4)) one, (and<br/>it is the RB), and surely may be registered.</p><p>Atentamente</p><p>Eduardo</p></div>
