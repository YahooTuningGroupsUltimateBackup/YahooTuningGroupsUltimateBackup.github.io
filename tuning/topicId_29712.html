John?</p><p> I&apos;m surprised about how much they do talk about pitchrelated<br/>stuff. My own reading about Asafiew (long time ago, nothing<br/>material left that I could fall back on) seemed to posit the<br/>meaning of &quot;intonation&quot; somewhere in the realm of &quot;giving voice<br/>to something&quot; in a very general sense that would include voice<br/>quality or rhythmic models, the interplay of which would be<br/>characteristic for different folk musics.</p><p>klaus</p></div><h3><a id=29772 href="#29772">ðŸ”—</a>jpehrson@rcn.com</h3><span>10/30/2001 6:32:15 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Here is Anton Rovner&apos;s prompt response about Boris Asafiev.  It<br/>doesn&apos;t sound like he was very involved in microtonality:</p><p>Rovner:</p><p>&gt;I know that Boris Asafiev was a very important music critic of the<br/>early 20th century (the 1920&apos;s, chiefly), who wrote about everything<br/>and everybody at the time, but unfortunately I am not too familiar<br/>with his writings, though I should be. I read some isolated fragments<br/>of his artcles, but did not remember anything especially distinctive.<br/>I don&apos;t even remember if he had any special original ideas such as,<br/>for instance, about microtonality or anything else - even though his<br/>name is all too familiar. He was also a composer and wrote a<br/>ballet &quot;the Bakhchisarai Fountain&quot; after Pushkin&apos;s poem, of a rather<br/>traditional, Neo-Classical style of the 1920&apos;s. I have to<br/>&gt;check up on him, and if I will find anything, I will let you know.<br/>&gt;</p><p>Joseph Pehrson</p></div>
