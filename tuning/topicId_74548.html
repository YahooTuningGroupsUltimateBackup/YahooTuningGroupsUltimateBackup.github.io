Here&apos;s the page:</p><p><a href="http://mysterybear.net/article/20/sunday-afternoon">http://mysterybear.net/article/20/sunday-afternoon</a></p><p>There&apos;s MIDI for the original version, along with versions by JL Smith (JI), Gene Ward Smith (31-EDO) and Charles Lucy (LucyTuning).  These are all rendered in software, but they do provide an opportunity to compare different tunings as applied to the same piece of music.</p><p>- Dave</p><p>Petr Pa&dcaron;&zdot;&dblac;&dcaron;&zdot;&dblac;zek wrote:<br/>&gt; Hello everyone.<br/>&gt; &gt; Maybe someone of you here could help me.
