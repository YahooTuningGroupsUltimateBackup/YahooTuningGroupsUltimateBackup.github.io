If one part were to exceed the limit, it would<br/>&gt; not affect the other playing parts.  A more expensive solution, but<br/>&gt; in my opinion, the most desireable.</p><p>For people who want the effect of something like a large organ where<br/>one can literally &quot;pull out the stops,&quot; or even say to approximate in<br/>live performance a Venetian ensemble of around 1600 with maybe 12<br/>instruments, this option sounds like a very handy solution.</p><p>However, for what I&apos;m usually involved in, no more than four parts<br/>with one or at most two &quot;instruments&quot; on a part -- the 16-note limit<br/>is less of a problem. For example, a typical registration for me might<br/>be one manual as something like a usual organ (e.g. cello + flute),<br/>and the other as a regal (a reed organ which sounds like a crumhorn,<br/>very pleasantly &quot;buzzy&quot;).</p><p>If I assign 3 sound generators to the regal manual, then this<br/>&quot;instrument&quot; can support up to 6 notes at the same time, leaving<br/>another 3 generators (6 notes) for one of the voices of the &quot;organ&quot; on<br/>the other manual and 2 generators (4 notes) for the other voice.</p><p>If I play three-part music (typical of the 13th and 14th centuries),<br/>or four-part music with two parts on each manual, there&apos;s likely no<br/>problem at all. If I play four parts on a single manual, then six<br/>notes should still be enough pretty much to allow for any momentary<br/>overlapping of notes -- the voice with only two generators (4 notes)<br/>might occasionally drop out at points of overlap, but this may not be<br/>too noticeable -- at least for me.</p><p>If each manual is mapped to an &quot;instrument&quot; with a single &quot;voice&quot; --<br/>e.g. one flavor of &quot;harpsichord&quot; for the lower manual, another for the<br/>upper -- then each instrument has four generators and eight notes,<br/>more than enough for playing four parts at once on either manual.</p><p>[On adapting a tuning with more than 12 notes per octave to two<br/>keyboards by mapping different subsets of the tuning to each keyboard<br/>in repeating 12-note octave patterns]</p><p>&gt; Unfortunately, this assumes your synthesizers allow full keyboard<br/>&gt; assignment (keyboard-scaling) as opposed to merely octave<br/>&gt; assignment. A lot of what would have been really wicked microtonal<br/>&gt; machines ended up being impeded by the octave-scaling limitation<br/>&gt; (e.g. Kurzweil K150), but with your idea, this obviously wouldn&apos;t<br/>&gt; really pose a big problem as you said.</p><p>Typically I use this solution for Pythagorean and meantone tunings of<br/>between around 13 and 16 notes where only some of the accidentals<br/>differ -- an equivalent of the &quot;split-key&quot; instruments of the<br/>15th-18th centuries (e.g. G#/Ab, Eb/D#).</p><p>A more adventurous application is to have a 24-note Pythagorean or<br/>meantone keyboard with the two keyboards a Pythagorean comma or<br/>meantone diesis apart. The former kind of tuning I call &quot;Xeno-Gothic,&quot;<br/>because it includes a 12-17 note Pythagorean tuning as described in<br/>14th-15th century sources, plus extra notes for things like cadences<br/>from near-7-limit intervals to the stable 3-limit ones. John Chalmers<br/>helped to give me the idea for this when he mentioned to me that a<br/>Pythagorean tuning eventually approximates 7-limit as well as 5-limit<br/>ratios.</p><p>The 24-note meantone tuning, specifically 1/4-comma, is basically a<br/>subset of Nicola Vicentino&apos;s 31-note archicembalo -- and fortunately,<br/>a very usable subset. As I&apos;ll discuss below, Vicentino&apos;s own<br/>archicembalo or &quot;superharpsichord&quot; of 1555 provides a partial<br/>precedent for this kind of layout: the first and fourth &quot;ranks&quot; of his<br/>keyboard have the same usual seven diatonic notes, but a meantone<br/>diesis of about 1/5-tone apart.</p><p>Incidentally, the early 17th-century keyboards of Scipione Stella and<br/>Fabio Colonna described in the latter&apos;s treatise of 1618 have a<br/>feature mentioned in this discussion: some &quot;redundant&quot; keys repeating<br/>the same note in more than one rank for more flexible fingering.<br/>Colonna&apos;s design -- for which Stella also claimed credit -- has five<br/>ranks of seven keys, with the ranks tuned in steps of 1/5-tone. Thus<br/>while there are 31 steps per octave on this circulating keyboard<br/>(likely 1/4-comma meantone), there are 35 keys per octave, with some<br/>redundancy.</p><p>Of course, there&apos;s also 17-tone equal temperament (17-tet), a tuning<br/>which John Chalmers also called to my attention.</p><p>&gt; This is precisely the reason beyond the obvious &quot;part&quot; advantages<br/>&gt; that I advocate Jacob Duringer&apos;s &quot;Monolith&quot;.

A solo keyboardist playing everything at once,<br/>no matter on how sophisticated a keyboard with however many<br/>simultaneous timbres or &quot;instruments,&quot; is a different matter.</p><p>Maybe this is in part a question of &quot;keyboardist&apos;s pride&quot; -- a bit<br/>like the ancient story of someone who discovered the power of riding a<br/>horse, and was intoxicated by &quot;horse pride.&quot; There is indeed a power<br/>in being able to create the effect of a polyphonic ensemble with the<br/>movements of one&apos;s own fingers on a keyboard -- whether the musical<br/>engine is a medieval pipe organ or an electronic synthesizer.</p><p>However, the subtle cooperation of a group of singers and players, one<br/>to a part, has its own charm and perfection. So does the patient<br/>process of overdubbing (or more recently also sequencing), where again<br/>it is possible to give each melodic line its own focal attention.</p><p>With this reservation, I would say that the &quot;x/y&quot; concept of keyboards<br/>with one axis for the usual pitch variations on a single manual, and<br/>another for timbre, is a very interesting one. In fact, the Y axis<br/>might represent differences of either timbre or pitch -- or in some<br/>cases, both at once.</p><p>Really, we can go back for example to 16th-century keyboard design to<br/>see this &quot;x and y&quot; concept in practice.

For example, to play<br/>an early 15th-century piece, I might have one manual in a usual<br/>&quot;organlike&quot; registration and a Pythagorean tuning of Eb-G#, which<br/>provides regular and active Pythagorean thirds and sixths.

There is<br/>no question in my mind that despite the public&apos;s apprehension to studio<br/>techniques (including the use of multitrack recording and overdubbing), the<br/>studio has fostered more innovation via experimentation than I think was<br/>previously possible under a &quot;live performance only&quot; scenario.</p><p>&gt; Maybe this is in part a question of &quot;keyboardist&apos;s pride&quot; -- a bit<br/>&gt; like the ancient story of someone who discovered the power of riding a<br/>&gt; horse, and was intoxicated by &quot;horse pride.&quot; There is indeed a power<br/>&gt; in being able to create the effect of a polyphonic ensemble with the<br/>&gt; movements of one&apos;s own fingers on a keyboard -- whether the musical<br/>&gt; engine is a medieval pipe organ or an electronic synthesizer.<br/>&gt;<br/>I will agree as well that the concept of controlling such an array of<br/>instruments can be quite intoxicating at times, and perhaps &quot;horse pride&quot;<br/>nails the concept right on the nose. =)</p><p>Overall though, I am rather tired of finding a very conservative and biased<br/>public in regard to electronic music. It seems the public often finds the<br/>synthesizer an icon of the &quot;dehumanization&quot; of music as an art and a<br/>significant reason for the downward spiral of music in the modern day. I<br/>think it may be possibly obvious by the recent large decline of synthesizers<br/>as a mainstay of any kind of mainstream work.</p><p>While, I will try not step into this realm of unattractive cynicism for now,<br/>it is clear to me that whether or not Mr. Duringer&apos;s invention enables more<br/>sophisticated solo performance may be negligible at this time. The public<br/>will probably never view this invention as anything more than an oddity, as<br/>it is an unwaivering belief at the moment by the public that the synthesizer<br/>does not require the same kind of skill, prowess and stellar musicianship<br/>that a &quot;real instrument played by a real musician does&quot;. Until this changes,<br/>I am not sure what can be said, since it seems to me the &quot;problem&quot; with<br/>electronic instruments isn&apos;t the instruments themselves.</p><p>Hence, why I think the Monolith&apos;s other &quot;advantages&quot; should be given a good<br/>look. Since, even if I am completely wrong regarding the public&apos;s attitude<br/>(which is certainly very possible), perhaps with the most excellent<br/>combination of today&apos;s electronic instruments can we see some sort of<br/>starting block for keyboard evolution in regard to &quot;replacement&quot; schemes<br/>utilizing traditional techniques.</p><p>&gt; However, the subtle cooperation of a group of singers and players, one<br/>&gt; to a part, has its own charm and perfection. So does the patient<br/>&gt; process of overdubbing (or more recently also sequencing), where again<br/>&gt; it is possible to give each melodic line its own focal attention.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; With this reservation, I would say that the &quot;x/y&quot; concept of keyboards<br/>&gt; with one axis for the usual pitch variations on a single manual, and<br/>&gt; another for timbre, is a very interesting one. In fact, the Y axis<br/>&gt; might represent differences of either timbre or pitch -- or in some<br/>&gt; cases, both at once.<br/>With the flexibility of MIDI and modern synthesizers, and of course the<br/>assignment of X/Y &apos;matrices&apos; on the instrument itself, it seems to me that<br/>any sort of scheme can be left up the &quot;performer&quot;. I rather like this idea,<br/>despite its lack of any sort available standard that I can recall.</p><p>Obviously, with this sort of flexibility &quot;on call&quot;, I don&apos;t think you<br/>necessarily need to box yourself into any particular &quot;application&quot; or<br/>&quot;technique&quot; to find this combination viable, in my opinion.</p><p>&gt;<br/>&gt; Really, we can go back for example to 16th-century keyboard design to<br/>&gt; see this &quot;x and y&quot; concept in practice. A two-manual organ with<br/>&gt; 12-note manuals tuned in unison -- e.g. a usual meantone -- has timbre<br/>&gt; as the y-dimension.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; However, Vicentino&apos;s archicembalo and also his arciorgano or<br/>&gt; &quot;superorgan&quot; he advertised in 1561 use the y-dimension as one of<br/>&gt; pitch. In a full 38-note version, what we have is basically two<br/>&gt; keyboards with 19 notes per octave each. The usual diatonic ranks --<br/>&gt; the white keys on the two manuals -- have the same usual arrangement,<br/>&gt; but are tuned a diesis or 1/5-tone (what I call a &quot;fifthtone&quot;) apart.<br/>&gt;<br/>I will definitely agree that it is certainly not the first time this concept<br/>has been seen in practice. But, I do think with the level of technology we<br/>have today with electronic instruments, perhaps it might be wise to try this<br/>concept yet again, as I think it might be more promising this time around.</p><p>&gt; Interestingly, with a two-manual setup, sometimes I use the<br/>&gt; y-dimension for pitch and timbre simultaneously. For example, to play<br/>&gt; an early 15th-century piece, I might have one manual in a usual<br/>&gt; &quot;organlike&quot; registration and a Pythagorean tuning of Eb-G#, which<br/>&gt; provides regular and active Pythagorean thirds and sixths. The other<br/>&gt; manual in Gb-B, in a contrasting regal registration, provides smooth<br/>&gt; Pythagorean diminished fourths, or near-pure schisma thirds and<br/>&gt; sixths, for written note-spellings involving sharps (e.g. E-Ab for<br/>&gt; written E-G#).<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; For a German piece from the Buxheimer Organ Book, I find shifting my<br/>&gt; hands between the manuals from phrase to phrase so that sometimes the<br/>&gt; upper manual plays the upper part(s), and sometimes the lower part(s),<br/>&gt; adds a pleasant variety of colors, along with the nuances of<br/>&gt; intonation.<br/>Yeah, I could imagine. You have obviously done significantly more<br/>experimentation and made more use of this idea than I have, so I am very<br/>pleased to see that it has worked out well for you. :D</p><p>&gt;<br/>&gt; In an archicembalo-like tuning of more than about 16 or 17 notes per<br/>&gt; octave, however, I tend to use a single registration for both manuals<br/>&gt; -- because otherwise the jumping back and forth can get a bit<br/>&gt; distracting.<br/>I figured that to be a problem as well. Somewhat of a hassle at times, but<br/>nonetheless mostly effective as it would seem from what you tell me. Cool!</p><p>&gt;<br/>&gt; Please let me just add that I see a place both for more or less<br/>&gt; &quot;conventional&quot; keyboards which emulate traditional organ/harpsichord<br/>&gt; technique (or the technique of the more recently introduced piano),<br/>&gt; and for specialized keyboards with various &quot;honeycomb&quot; arrangements.<br/>&gt; The latter keyboards may be a technological invitation to new music.<br/>I do see this as well, and while I hope you will agree with me, as it is my<br/>earnest belief that the standard &quot;keyboard&quot; schemes available perhaps are in<br/>need of some kind of definite evolution if we are to see such an evolution<br/>of any kind in the music we create and perform.</p><p>I have received a few replies to our previous posts regarding Starr Labs&apos;<br/>&quot;MicroZone&quot;. As you said, my first inclination was to see that it probably<br/>invited considerable experimentation as well. But as it seems we both agree,<br/>it does not make a absolutely logical transformation from the traditional<br/>keyboard schemes available and their respective techniques (what, are these<br/>all so useless now?). So, with the obvious problem of manufacture of the<br/>Monolith aside, I see as much of a place for instruments like the Monolith<br/>as I do for the MicroZone.</p><p>&gt;<br/>&gt; Anyway, I&apos;m really enjoying this dialogue, which gets into the<br/>&gt; interaction between synthesizer technology, alternate tunings, and<br/>&gt; questions of basic musical values in solo and ensemble performances<br/>&gt; alike.<br/>As am I! Much appreciated. =)</p><p>&gt;<br/>&gt; Most appreciatively,<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Margo Schulter<br/>&gt; <a href="mailto:mschulter@value.net">mschulter@value.net</a><br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>-- Art</p></div>
