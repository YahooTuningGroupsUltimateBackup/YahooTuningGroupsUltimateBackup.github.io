It seems to me that it could hardly be otherwise, for when you tune up the tetrachords according to ancient instructions, you get just gobs of either really consonant (almost windchime) intervals, or tons of neat sonorities suspiciously reminiscent of the more hardcore Balkan folk music which lives on to this day.</p></div><h3><a id=99748 href="#99748">ðŸ”—</a>Carl Lumma &#x3C;carl@...&#x3E;</h3><span>6/3/2011 11:08:23 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>I like it!

You can hear it melt together, more like feel it, but it&apos;s still complex so it&apos;s less hollow.</p><p>The tetrachords are a kind of syntonic/equable diatonic and hemiolic chromatic. (Soft chromatics bordering on the intense enharmonic are pretty much my standard).</p><p>This particular version of these tetrachords goes 1, 12/11, 11/9, 4/3 for the diatonic, which is more like an Al Farabi tetrachord, in the &quot;snake charmer&quot; ordering (sLs).</p><p>From the 12/11 to the 4/3 we have 11/9; taking this as the characteristic interval for the hemiolic chromatic, we split 12/11 in the classical manner using  the harmonic mean and get (this time listing the intervals between the pitches) 24/23, 23/22, 11/9 (see number 176 in the catalog in John Chalmer&apos;s Divisions of the Tetrachord).</p><p>The interlocked tetrachords are now 1, 24/23, 12/11, 11/9, 4/3.

The best part is the lead about Chalmers&apos;s<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; book, which I hadn&apos;t heard of. I just downloaded it. Maybe once I read<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; that I&apos;ll have a better feel for how these tetrachords worked in<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; practice. I&apos;m surprised to see &quot;ancient tetrachords&quot; loaded with 11s<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; and 23s and such, so this should be interesting to dig into.<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; Thanks,<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; Jake<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; Maqam tuning is also tetrachordal and set up basically the same way. Really<br/>&gt; &gt; what&apos;s important is the relative step sizes &quot;small, medium, large&quot; within a<br/>&gt; &gt; tetrachord, and their ordering.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &quot;complexity&quot; is mostly illusory. Chalmers doesn&apos;t go into detail about the<br/>&gt; &gt; hands-on aspects in DotT, but if you spend a lot of time tuning different<br/>&gt; &gt; tetrachords, you&apos;ll find that the &quot;complex&quot; intervals of ancient and<br/>&gt; &gt; medieval islamic tetrachords are the results of very simple mechanical<br/>&gt; &gt; processes, like simply fretting right in the middle of two frets which were<br/>&gt; &gt; placed by tuning fifths of most simple ratios. Take for example the<br/>&gt; &gt; allegedly &quot;complex&quot; ancient Greek ratios of 31/30 and 32/31, which some<br/>&gt; &gt; scholars have dismissed as numerological fancy. Rather embarassingly for<br/>&gt; &gt; these scholars, we find that if we place a fret 5/4 down from 4/3 and simply<br/>&gt; &gt; stick a fret halfway between there and the &quot;1&quot; fret, we&apos;ve created these<br/>&gt; &gt; &quot;complex&quot; ratios, effortlessly.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; Same with the ratios of 23- I just &quot;stuck a fret halfway between&quot; 12/11 and<br/>&gt; &gt; 1 to get them. 12/11, and the 11/9 from there to 4/3, is of course as easy<br/>&gt; &gt; as it gets to fret.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; Other &quot;complexities&quot; are revealed to be simplicities when you think about<br/>&gt; &gt; the documented ancient practice of ticking off frets at equal divisions of a<br/>&gt; &gt; ruler, or the practice, also documented, of &quot;sweetening&quot; simple Pythagorean<br/>&gt; &gt; structures.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; And most importantly, you can feel when you&apos;re try to do the intervals (in<br/>&gt; &gt; context, with each other) by ear on an instrument of flexible pitch if<br/>&gt; &gt; they&apos;re likely speculatory.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt;</p></div><h3><a id=99765 href="#99765">ðŸ”—</a>Daniel Nielsen &#x3C;nielsed@...&#x3E;</h3><span>6/4/2011 10:23:35 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>On Sat, Jun 4, 2011 at 7:14 AM, lobawad &lt;lobawad@...&gt; wrote:</p><p>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Authentic &quot;maqam music&quot; is transmitted by oral tradition and rote, and I<br/>&gt; see no reason for that to change.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; For new music, syncretism, polyphony, etc. the first step is obvious:<br/>&gt; get the basic Pythagorean structure down.
