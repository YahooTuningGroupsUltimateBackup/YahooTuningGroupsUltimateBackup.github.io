If it is NOT true than every chord<br/>&gt;   progression has to<br/>&gt;       be equally consonant. Perhaps it is?!</p><p>Actually, I am very interested in music that is not necessarily<br/>harmonically directed  (in the sense of being &quot;label-able&quot; with I, IV, V<br/>and other functional symbols),  but where every chord is in fact<br/>consonant,  and the &quot;direction&quot; of the progression derives not from<br/>harmonic rules, but from counterpoint.</p><p>Rennaissance counterpoint is an example of this (for the most part).  You<br/>wouldn&apos;t label the &quot;verticals&quot; with &quot;I V IV VI&quot; etc., or if you did, the<br/>progrssion wouldn&apos;t make much sense from that point of view.</p><p>On the other hand, the verticals are all either consonances or carefully<br/>regulated dissonances (i.e. suspensions).  And there is usually a logic to<br/>the flow of things, but it comes from the counterpoint and the lines,<br/>rather than the harmony.</p><p>Another quite different example of this is from Strauss &quot;Till<br/>Eulenspeigel&apos;s Merry Pranks&quot;  #19 of the score.

In two voice writing,<br/>   the harmony is implied rather than fully stated, and while the harmonic implications<br/>   of a perfect fifth are clear, thirds and sixths (the predominant consonances) are subject<br/>   to at least two different interpretations.<br/>     Although linear movement in the counterpoint may clarify the harmony, the<br/>   importance of quickly and consistenly establishing a tonality through strong, well-<br/>   defined progressions cannot be minimized.<br/>      The author also makes use of a lot of Roman numerals too.<br/>       Don&apos;t ask me if he&apos;s totally right or not, I have thought about learning 12 EDO<br/>    music theory but it just never happens.</p><p>   It is very difficult for me to listen to selected music so I&apos;ll take your word about<br/>   the Strauss piece.<br/>   When I was young I tried ( and failed) to play a lot of Bach&apos;s stuff.

There must be hundreds of poss-<br/>   ibilities here. I am hoping to get (have given to me) something that identifies what are<br/>   the best tonics. 551 and 969 are important, but others are too. A progression<br/>   that has two tonics very close together probably wouldn&apos;t be consonant.

If you have samll, large and very large intervals, cycle on until the gaps are filled.<br/>- take your chord and cycle it for a FEW times. This, too, will give you a collection of intervals. You may want to try this with different chord types. The scale building principles above can apply, but don&apos;t need to. You might also like a mix of chord types (harmonic minor is created from a minor-minor-major chain).<br/>- write a simple melody, one that donesn&apos;t modulate. This may be hard to tell in tonal system nobody knows.</p><p>There a progressions that sound natural because they stay in the key. If you can build your chord types on each of the scale tones, it&apos;s nice. If you move stepwise from each one of a chord&apos;s tones, and the results are the same, even nicer (if not, you may think of think of tones you have to skip to achieve the first result somewhat like blue notes; none of the above has to be criterion to trash a scale).

Even if everybody here could give you the cut and dry answer that movement by perfect fifths is very, very OK, there may be better ways (and movement by perfect fifths only bypasses your tones that are 60 cent off).</p><p>&quot;Consonant progression&quot; might mean &quot;progression within a regular set of tones (scale) by a preferred number of steps&quot;? Depending on what you like to end up with, there may be many scales to choose from, and more than one way to cycle through. The movement within the scale also entails a regular change between different chord types. But before looking at musical pregressions, you have to find a scale where your chord movement can take place.</p><p>Just a little bit more before I leave you alone: Don&apos;t let easy theory books tell you a scale has a preordained tonic. Music has a tonic, it&apos;s the note where your melody comes to rest; so a scale has room for several tonics (and the ordering of a scale from one of the tonics is called mode).</p><p>klaus</p></div><h3>Carl Lumma &#x3C;ekin@lumma.org&#x3E;</h3><span>1/11/2004 3:03:05 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>&gt;       Stephen writes:::::::::<br/>&gt;    (Actually I meant to say COPY and PASTE above.)<br/>&gt;   The first complaint I got about my e-mailing was last night.<br/>&gt;  I fail to see what&apos;s wrong.

The purpose of the first one was to find useful cycles and to get a feel for the interdependence of cycling interval and chord type, voice leading for short. Maybe I shouldn&apos;t have singled out the obviously short cycles beforehand. The more, since the other short ones (like 6, 9, 10, 12) result in permutations of 3 and 5, which again may be a good and useful thing - depending on the music you want to make.</p><p>The second part of the mail concerned finding a context (other than the whole pitch collection) for the cycle(s) he found to be useful. Here the short cycles could have been mentioned, but like JP, I tend to think that getting your way around &quot;traditional&quot; procedures like filling generator gaps or chaining chords are more fundamental than Messiaen- or Webern-like structures that reflect back on themselves (the real reason I went to such great pains to circumvent these scales is probably that I didn&apos;t want to show my bias for them ... there... now I&apos;ve said it).</p><p>snip... hopefully all satisfactorily botched into the above.</p><p>&gt; &gt; One example of this would be Blackwood&apos;s symmetrical 10-tone scale in &gt; 15 equal, which is simply a large step (2/15 oct.) alternating with a &gt; small step (1/15 oct.) all the way through the octave.

Tempering out 81:80 results in meantony realizations of the diatonic scale, no? If not, what is the pitch collection of just major chords on F, C, and G? I should have said, diatonic C major (of F lydian, or whatever) with a flat A.
