I know of no instance of it referring to a<br/>&gt;full octave, as the above seems to read.  (Am I missing<br/>&gt;something?)  The critical<br/>&gt;bandwidth varies a little with frequency.  But not that<br/>&gt;much!  And the idea that a minor 3rd is the most dissonant<br/>&gt;interval that 2 sines can make seems ridiculous.  Why his<br/>&gt;graph appears to show the phenomenon over an octave beats<br/>&gt;me (oops, NPI!).  Perhaps he&apos;s using it, or some other term,<br/>&gt;differently.</p><p>Last yera, as part of my analysis portfolio in my finals of a degree in<br/>music, I wrote an essay called &quot;Modern psycho-acoustics and its impact<br/>on Schenkerian analysis&quot;.* Its references included:</p><p>W. J. Dowling and D. L. Harwood, Music Cognition, (Orlando, Academic<br/>Press, Inc., 1986), p. 50. and 83.</p><p>I interpreted what I found in this interesting book to mean the<br/>following (interpreted for musicians with little knowledge of acoustics<br/>and less of other parts of physics):</p><p>&quot;The critical bandwidth is almost constant below about 200 Hz. and<br/>approximates to a constant fraction of the basic frequency above about<br/>500 Hz.</p><p>&quot;This means that, in musical terms, from about the top of the treble<br/>stave upward the most dissonant interval* remains constant at somewhat<br/>less than a semitone, while at middle C it is 1.5 semitones, roughly<br/>doubling for each octave downwards from there.&quot;</p><p>*  The complete essay is at <a href="http://www.hpsl.demon.co.uk/schenk/">http://www.hpsl.demon.co.uk/schenk/</a></p><p>+  I mean between sine waves.</p><p>--<br/>Ken Moore<br/><a href="mailto:ken@hpsl.demon.co.uk">ken@hpsl.demon.co.uk</a><br/>Web site: <a href="http://www.hpsl.demon.co.uk/">http://www.hpsl.demon.co.uk/</a></p></div><h3>rtomes@xxxxx.xxx.xxxxxxxxxxxxx)</h3><span>6/15/1999 5:39:01 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Ken Moore [TD219.5]<br/>&gt;&quot;This means that, in musical terms, from about the top of the treble<br/>&gt;stave upward the most dissonant interval* remains constant at somewhat<br/>&gt;less than a semitone, while at middle C it is 1.5 semitones, roughly<br/>&gt;doubling for each octave downwards from there.&quot;</p><p>From the above it seems that the constant difference is about 23 Hz up<br/>to the high treble (and 4 to 5% difference from there on up).  This<br/>frequency is an interesting one because it also occurs in the sense of<br/>sight as roughly the sampling rate (given in one reference as 20 to 25<br/>Hz).  I imagine that it some sort of fundamental sampling rate in the<br/>brain and that as it is approached by any frequency in the senses it<br/>would cause unpleasant effects.</p><p>I know that I can count repeated phenomena that have up to about 8<br/>repeats per second.  It seems that this is related to the same ~23 Hz<br/>sampling rate as 3 samples per cycle are needed to get a fix on the<br/>cycle (two can theoretically do it if you are lucky in hitting the highs<br/>and lows but any phase drift loses it).  That seems to also be the<br/>reason for the change over from feeling individual pulses to hearing low<br/>sounds between about 8 and 23 Hz.</p><p>-- Ray Tomes -- <a href="http://www.kcbbs.gen.nz/users/rtomes/rt-home.htm">http://www.kcbbs.gen.nz/users/rtomes/rt-home.htm</a> --<br/>   Cycles email list -- <a href="http://www.kcbbs.gen.nz/users/af/cyc.htm">http://www.kcbbs.gen.nz/users/af/cyc.htm</a><br/>Alexandria eGroup list -- <a href="http://www.kcbbs.gen.nz/users/af/alex.htm">http://www.kcbbs.gen.nz/users/af/alex.htm</a><br/>Boundaries of Science <a href="http://www.kcbbs.gen.nz/users/af/scienceb.htm">http://www.kcbbs.gen.nz/users/af/scienceb.htm</a></p></div>
