I need some conformation.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I have seen replacement guitar nuts, that are not straight. Earvana<br/>&gt; is one company that pushes this product as an intonation solver.</p><p>Hi Venus-</p><p>When I refretted my guitar for just intonation, I ended up fine tuning each<br/>fret placement by ear. Why try to calculate all the variables when you can<br/>just put the fret where the interval sounds as true to your ear as you want<br/>it to be? I used JIcalc to generate the frequency I wanted and marked the<br/>fingerboard. After putting frets on, I could easily listen again and check<br/>the intonation, also checking notes against each other on the neck. As it<br/>turned out, there were only a couple that needed adjustment. I guess I<br/>should say I use individual frets under each string and they are glued on<br/>wire segments- that way they are easy to remove and adjust if necessary.</p><p>In case you havn&apos;t run across it, I talk more about this on my website:</p><p><a href="http://www.users.interport.net/~dante/justguitar.html">http://www.users.interport.net/~dante/justguitar.html</a></p><p>However you do it, you&apos;re in for a treat!<br/>JI guitar is sweet, sweet, sweet!</p><p>Dante<br/>(just another crazy who thinks tuning is a dimension of music)</p></div><h3>James C.

A fretsaw from Stewart-Macdonald<br/>(<a href="http://www.stewmac.com">www.stewmac.com</a>) or Luthiers Mercantile (<a href="http://www.wco.com/~lmi/catalog.htm">www.wco.com/~lmi/catalog.htm</a><br/>should set you back around $20. Most woodworking stores will have a<br/>nigh-identical item called a &quot;gent&apos;s saw,&quot; although I believe ladies are<br/>now also allowed to purchase them. If you have a tablesaw, there are<br/>slotting blades available. Fretwire varies in width, so you need to think<br/>about matching the saw to your particular fretwire. If you buy locally,<br/>maybe the folks in the store will let you make a test cut in a scrap of<br/>ebony (or whatever you&apos;ll be using).</p><p>And Dante&apos;s _really_ got it right: the right fret position for one string<br/>may be wrong for the next. I like the idea of gluing them on - if you use<br/>hide glue, water will dissolve it if you need to move the fret. Dante -<br/>what kind of glue did you use?</p><p>Another way around the problem occurs to me. You could use one strip of<br/>wood for each string, slot each strip separately, and glue them all to the<br/>neck.</p><p>One last thought: the lower the fret, the easier it is to keep the<br/>intonation you&apos;ve worked so hard to get -- the higher the fret, the easier<br/>it is to play barre chords. You decide!</p><p>- Chris</p></div><h3>Rosati &#x3C;dante@pop.interport.net&#x3E;</h3><span>5/28/2000 10:21:25 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>----- Original Message -----<br/>From: James C.

The couple of frets I moved, and one or two<br/>that popped off due to not enough glue initially, I replaced using crazy<br/>glue. I have not tried to remove one of these but I&apos;m sure they would come<br/>off. I used #16 gauge wire which is circular, but filed many of them a bit<br/>flat on the top to get rid of a few buzzes resulting from the frets being<br/>close together. Each wire piece is ~8mm, but this is on a classical guitar,<br/>and they have pretty wide string spacing. All in all, its still working fine<br/>a year later. (I have some new pieces that I hope to get around to recording<br/>soon to put up on my mp3 site.)</p><p>Dante</p></div>
