I have plenty to go on now...  And to Joe Monzo -- yes, I did<br/>get a &quot;scientific&quot; calculator for use with microtonal work, but I must<br/>confess I haven&apos;t yet used it much... maybe this is my big chance!  Perhaps<br/>the MT-1200 that Wim and Christopher Chapman suggested is the gadget for<br/>me!  I&apos;ll look into it.</p><p>Joseph Pehrson</p></div>
