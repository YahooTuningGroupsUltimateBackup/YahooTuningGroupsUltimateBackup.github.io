There are no direct quotes or evidence.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; In fact, there is as much, if not more, to suggest that Werckmeister III was<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; not Bach&apos;s standard for harpsichord in particular...even Werckmeister<br/>&gt; himself<br/>&gt; published a separate harpsichord tuning in a thouroughbass manual--the<br/>&gt; tuning<br/>&gt; is not Werck III....so if Bach was part of the Werckmeister tradition in a<br/>&gt; strict sense (hardly something that one would expect from a universalist<br/>&gt; mind<br/>&gt; like Bach&apos;s, who would have certainly known of other tuning systems besides<br/>&gt; Werckmeisters), it wouldn&apos;t be Werck III on the harpsichord.</p><p>Hello Aaron,</p><p>In all good nature, I must disagree.  I&apos;ve included some material already<br/>written that deals with the above.</p><p>From &quot;Bach&apos;s Tuning&quot; by Johnny Reinhard, unpublished:</p><p>    In 1698, as an amendment to Die nothwendigsten Ammerckungen und Regeln,<br/>wie der Bassus continuus oder General-Bass wol k&ouml;nne tractiret werden<br/>(Essential annotations and rules concerning the proper realization of the basso<br/>continuo or thorough-bass), Werckmeister published &quot;Short Lesson and Addition, how<br/>one can tune and temper well a clavier.&quot;  Directed towards the beginner, and in<br/>tacet recognition that the organ will always be tuned by the professional,<br/>Werckmeister attempts to aid the individual tuning the harpsichord, and<br/>afterwards, the clavichord.  These individuals are unlikely to consult the monochord<br/>instructions of his work for professionals, &quot;Musical Temperament,&quot; or the clear<br/>and authentic mathematical instruction of how, through the analysis of the<br/>monochord, one can tune a keyboard instrument (especially organs, positives,<br/>regals, spinets, and such) in a well-tempered manner, in order that according to<br/>the practice of today, all modi ficti can be accepted in a pleasing and<br/>tolerable harmony; with a preliminary perfection and lesser perfection of the musical<br/>numbers, proportions, and consonants which in the process of setting up the<br/>temperament, are to be seriously considered.  In addition, a monochord is<br/>depicted distinctly and completely in a copperplate (Hehr, p. 1).</p><p>However, throughout &quot;Essential Annotations&mldr;,&quot; Werckmeister invites the reader<br/>to consult his Monochordo contained in &quot;Musical Temperament&quot; in order to<br/>&quot;find more exact information throughout the proportional numbers&quot; (Archambault, p.<br/>225).</p><p>&gt;<br/>&gt; But on second thought, maybe I did mean most...can any self-respecting<br/>&gt; musician claim he captured &apos;all&apos; (whatever that means) of what there is to<br/>&gt; be<br/>&gt; captured in interpreting a composition of a master?</p><p>Perhaps the &quot;spirit&quot; is like a concept, it is indivisible.  You either have<br/>it or you don&apos;t, as opposed to an &quot;idea.&quot;</p><p>&gt;<br/>&gt; It seems awfully  misguided to make statements regarding exactitude about<br/>&gt; music that is over 250 years old.</p><p>Maybe it is less misguided after years of performances of Bach in<br/>Werckmeister III?  Maybe things are revealed in the music that cannot be cajoled into<br/>e-mail, or even words?</p><p>The landscape of the authenticity movement &gt;<br/>&gt; itself is an evolving style...what else could it be? Some absolutist dogma<br/>&gt; about the absolute truth of this music? Absurd !!!!</p><p>Aaron, a composer having an exact tuning in mind is not absurd.  Musicians<br/>having doubt as to where the intonation lies is even more critical.  Losing<br/>vibrato makes these issues all the more vital to the power of the music, as well<br/>as revealing a missing dimension in the music&apos;s expression.</p><p>As if we could freeze its &gt;<br/>&gt; ever changing image, which itself is a product of what we are today, and how<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; we see ourselves. Every interpretation is a mirror reflecting the values and<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; thoughts of the interpreter, and there&apos;s more to it that simply being<br/>&gt; historically informed, important as that is. If what I&apos;m saying is NOT true,<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; then all historically informed players have given up playing with any stamp<br/>&gt; of personality, and I don&apos;t want to hear music played without personality.<br/>&gt; Boring !!!!!!</p><p>It would be silly for you or anyone to judge what I am trying to articulate<br/>as &quot;boring.&quot;  It would just be ignorant of the actual musical results.</p><p>&gt; I have faith that we would both be surprised by the way Bach himself<br/>&gt; actually</p><p>&gt; played his music. We know much less than we don&apos;t know. Admit that you are<br/>&gt; guided by faith and your taste, and we agree. But &apos;exact harmonic language&apos;?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; What on earth could you possibly mean by that? There&apos;s a generalist<br/>&gt; statement, if I&apos;m to understand what you mean by generalist.</p><p>Faith?  No.  The surprise is that European history has muddled, hidden, and<br/>offered misinformation at many turns.</p><p>&gt; Many times modern composers are excited when interpreters open doors in<br/>&gt; performance that even the composer themsleves hadn&apos;t opened. This is why I<br/>&gt; think the whole authenticity thing is (partially) dead and (partially)<br/>&gt; misguided--Bach himself is not the be all and end all interpreter of Bach&apos;s<br/>&gt; music !!!!</p><p>It is indeed interesting to discuss whether a composer performs his or her<br/>own music better than another.  I don&apos;t think this would apply to a virtuoso<br/>like Bach.  It certainly doesn&apos;t apply to my music.</p><p>The moment we believe that is the moment classical music dies as a<br/>&gt; living tradition, and the sorry news is that in many ways, it already has<br/>&gt; become like going to the museum. The most brilliant interpreters are not the<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; scholars, but the people who combine scholarship with the open-ended<br/>&gt; non-uptightness of a great jazz players.</p><p>Yes, Bach was an improviser, as I am.  And yes, classical music has been<br/>relegated to a museum existence all too often.  What I am striving for is a reason<br/>to make new recordings.  Hearing composers in their preferred tuning is<br/>inimicable to being in the composer&apos;s head.</p><p>However, Werckmeister III performance does not allow for the variations of<br/>player interpretation that you in the modern age so cherish.  It has its own<br/>rules, and thankfully, produces its own virtues.</p><p>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Warmly,<br/>&gt; --<br/>&gt; Aaron Krister Johnson<br/>&gt;</p><p>Aaron, I mean &quot;generalist&quot; in the sense that there is more detail available<br/>than the books and the writers tend to emphasize, usually for individual<br/>agendas.  If one believes that any old thing will do, then there really is no need<br/>to search further.  For me this trek began as a Masters paper in graduate<br/>studies, 25 years ago.  I have since written a book that is going through editing.<br/>As a musician, this takes back seat, still.</p><p>Below are some tracts from the book regarding Neidhardt.  It probably needs<br/>to be cleaned up.  But it will point out some important details, notably that<br/>Neidhardt was in no position to influence Bach.  I hope you find it of<br/>interest.</p><p>Johnny</p><p>From &quot;Bach&apos;s Tuning&quot; by Johnny Reinhard, unpublished:</p><p>That the clavichord should be associated with Bach as his favorite clavier<br/>bespeaks its tuning sensitivities.  This quiet instrument was capable of<br/>Bewebungen, a technique that allows for a sharpening of pitch with added arm<br/>pressure.  C.P.E. Bach wrote that the clavichord was indeed his father&apos;s favorite<br/>instrument.  Spitta added, It was possible to play cantabile on it, and this<br/>cantabile style was regarded by Bach as the foundation of all clavier-playing<br/>(Spitta, II:44).  This discussion of cantabile, or singing style, can easily refer<br/>to the competition in Jena of Neidhardt and Johann Nicholas Bach regarding the<br/>singability of their respective tuning preferences.  Johann Nicholas Bach<br/>(1669-1753), the oldest son of Johann Sebastian Bach&apos;s Uncle Johann Christoph<br/>Bach, and an expert on organ building, won the contest handily.  He had allowed a<br/>student to tune an organ which was in his charge, and it was found wanting by<br/>all concerned.  This may be the first line up of equal tempered versus<br/>well-tempered, with the Bach&apos;s championing the unequal.</p><p>It is ironic that Claudio Veroli concluded and volunteered that &quot;The famous<br/>tuning contest between Johnann Nikolaus Bach and Neidhardt (Jena, 1706) is not<br/>very relevant to the history of the temperaments&quot; (Veroli, p. 152).  He<br/>concluded that because Neidhardt used a monochord which is &quot;most unsatisfactory for<br/>tuning pipe organs&quot; it was no wonder how J.N. Bach won the contest&quot; (Veroli,<br/>pl. 153).  Veroli went further to suggest, &quot;Both were aiming at setting a<br/>circular temperament, most probably a similar variant also: something between, say,<br/>Schlick&apos;s and Vallotti&apos;s temepraments.&quot;   How odd for Veroli to volunteer an<br/>unknown Francesco Antonio Vallotti (1697-1780) tuning and a Renaissance-era<br/>Arnolt Schlick tuning when Werckmeister&apos;s tunings were in vogue.  This would<br/>move to a prejudice of Veroli that Werckmeister&apos;s tunings were not very good.<br/>(&quot;Werckmeister&apos;s first (and best) temperament may be considered an imperfect<br/>version of Vallotti&apos;s, with no qualities justifying its use instead of the<br/>latter&quot;) (Veroli, p. 152).  This is again a case of a modern judging past aesthetics<br/>by modern concerns, in this case harmonic justness trumping contrapuntal<br/>distinction in full modulation.  But how could he have missed that Neidhardt was<br/>promoting equal temperament in 1706 as described in Neidhardt&apos;s first book<br/>Beste und leichteste Temperatur des Monochordi, also published in 1706?</p><p>Some have called the Neidhardt tunings &quot;paper temperaments&quot; for their<br/>unlikely perfection in music practice.  In 1732 Neidhardt offered his readers a<br/>choice of twenty temperaments. The likelihood of other instruments playing with a<br/>keyboard in cantatas, chamber music, oratorio, passions, etc. would mitigate a<br/>complex tuning with many different sizes of fifths and the inevitable pile of<br/>thirds.</p><p>Theorist Johann Georg Neidhardt (1685-1739) suggested a variety of irregular<br/>circular temperaments, but the practical difficulty with which large ensembles<br/>would have to adapt belies its practicalities.  Neidhardt&apos;s temperament took<br/>advantage of the subtlest differences between keys and may have wor\ked well<br/>for solo keyboard works.  But without his endorsing a particular temperament,<br/>there is no way of knowing whether Neidhardt was as practical a musician as<br/>Andreas Werckmeister.  It would seem reasonable that the sharper the differences<br/>among the keys as to intervallic structure, the more confident the<br/>performance.  All the diatonic keys of Werckmeister III were already in the normal<br/>environment of the Baroque musician of Thuringia since they aurally mirror the<br/>diatonic keys of sixth comma meantone.  The most dissonant keys of Werckmeister III<br/>actually mirror equal temperament, such as E major.</p><p>The first circulating temperament (1724) of Neidhardt&apos;s is made up of four<br/>fifths in each group - pure, tempered by 1/12 comma, and by 1/6 comma.<br/>Neidhardt, like Werckmeister, had all his temperaments measured on a monochord aiding<br/>tuning accuracy through its consultation.  There are eight tempered fifths:<br/>four (on Ab, Eb, E and B) are two cents flat (as in equal temperament), four (on<br/>C, G, D, A) are four cents flat.</p><p>Circulating Temperament no. 2 (1724) was considered by its designer to be the<br/>best.   There are nine tempered fifths: six (on Gb, Db, Bb, F, A, B) are two<br/>cents flat (as in equal temperament), and three (on C, G, D) are four cents<br/>flat.</p><p>Neidhardt Model Temperament no. 3 (1732) has six tempered fifths, as follows:<br/>two (on Eb and Bb) are 2 cents flat (as in equal temperament), two (on C and<br/>G) are four cents flat, and two (on D and A) are six cents flat.  There are<br/>thus four different sizes of fifths and eight sizes of thirds (Blood,<br/>&quot;&apos;Well-tempering&apos; the clavier: five methods,&quot; p. 495).</p><p>Rasch points out that only equal temperament was described in his Beste und<br/>leichteste Temperatur (1706) (Rasch, &quot;Does&mldr;, p. 14).  The finer shades of<br/>differences in the keys occur in the succeeding works.  It appears that Neidhardt<br/>was embarrassed by his loss to Johann Nicholas Bach in 1706 and relinquished<br/>equal temperament to Temperament IV with its purview the courts, even though it<br/>was once the best of all tunings in 1706.  Neidhardt provided a metaphoric<br/>analysis of the tunings presented.</p><p>In my opinion, the first tuning is mostly fit for a village, the second one<br/>for a town, the third one for a city, and the fourth one for the court (Rasch,<br/>&quot;Does&mldr;p. 14).</p><p>The fourth Neidhardt circular temperament is the 1706 temperament of equal<br/>temperament, was demoted to fourth.  This likely means that Neidhardt&apos;s losing<br/>competition with Johann Nicholas Bach in Jena was made with equal temperament,<br/>which had been deemed &quot;unsingable.&quot;</p></div>
