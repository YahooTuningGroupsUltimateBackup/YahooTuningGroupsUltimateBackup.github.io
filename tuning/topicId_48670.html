I created in common with my son Herwig in 1988<br/>our first tuning program. Our idea was to create a program for electronic<br/>musical<br/>instruments adjusting the frequencies of the performed music &quot;on the flight&quot;<br/>to just intonation - without any additional message of the musician.<br/>Besides the retuning steps should be inaudible and the level of the<br/>frequencies should stay near to equal temperament.</p><p>Analysing interval and chord structures and retuning them to just intonation<br/>is more or less simple. But to do so for live music, holding the retuning<br/>steps<br/>inaudible and the positions near to equal temperament required a new idea in<br/>the<br/>position method.<br/>Our new idea was to combine a virtual line (the line of equal temperament)<br/>with a virtual point: The tuning center of every analysed chord structure.<br/>If you want to understand this, please visit our website:<br/><a href="http://www.hermode.com">www.hermode.com</a><br/>You will find the describtion of this basic idea on the end of<br/>&quot;How does Hermode Tuning work?&quot;<br/>This basic idea is protected by international patents.</p><p>For all who look for new own or other ideas in program controlled<br/>temperament:<br/>Please open the &quot;historical&quot; part of our sites. At the end of this you will<br/>find<br/>at the chapter &quot;Software driven tunings&quot; the description of four different<br/>ideas<br/>how to create self-regulating tuning programs. Shown by musical examples<br/>and diagrams. The forth of them is our &quot;Hermode Tuning&quot;. You will be aware<br/>why we are proud of our idea.</p><p>Meanwhile Hermode Tuning presents not only one program variation but<br/>many different so-called &quot;modes&quot;. Modes with &quot;only&quot; pure thirds and fifths,<br/>modes including the natural sept. Modes with inequal high tuned<br/>chords (with so-called key character), variations with different<br/>degree or &quot;depth&quot; of tuning.</p><p>Hermode Tuning actually is an internal feature of<br/>- the synthesizer &quot;Q&quot; of Waldorf. <a href="http://www.waldorf-music.de">www.waldorf-music.de</a><br/>- the synthesizer &quot;Virus&quot; of Access. <a href="http://www.kemper-digital.com">www.kemper-digital.com</a><br/>- as a feature in church organs of Content. <a href="http://www.content-organs.com">www.content-organs.com</a><br/>soon in<br/>- the virtual synth &quot;z3ta+&quot; of RGCaudio. <a href="http://www.rgcaudio.com">www.rgcaudio.com</a><br/>- in one of the leading sequencers<br/>- in virtual instruments of Native instruments<br/>- in so called &quot;Chorleiter&quot; keyboards</p><p>Kind regards</p><p>Werner Mohrlok<br/>Hermode Tuning<br/>Hohenbergstr. 16<br/>D 78647 Trossingen<br/>Tel +49 7425 6529<br/>Fax +49 7425 6336</p></div><h3><a id=48679 href="#48679">ðŸ”—</a>Paul Erlich &#x3C;paul@stretch-music.com&#x3E;</h3><span>11/27/2003 7:16:08 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;Werner Mohrlok&quot; &lt;wmohrlok@h...&gt; wrote:</p><p>&gt; instruments adjusting the frequencies of the performed music &quot;on<br/>the flight&quot;<br/>&gt; to just intonation - without any additional message of the musician.<br/>&gt; Besides the retuning steps should be inaudible and the level of the<br/>&gt; frequencies should stay near to equal temperament.</p><p>For some pieces, including almost everything written before 1800, the<br/>basic &quot;fixed&quot; tuning is better chosen as something different from<br/>equal temperament, and the retuning steps can, as as result, often be<br/>made considerably smaller -- in my experience, often making the<br/>difference between audibility (say at 11 cents) and inaudibility (at<br/>6 cents).

Now that I have an idea of how hermode<br/>works, its clear that there are several things<br/>different between the various methods of automated retuning.</p><p>&gt; 1. Analysing chords is very simple and I didn&apos;t know that this could<br/>&gt; be a question. All actual &quot;Note On&quot; are projected on one the twelve<br/>&gt; positions of one octave from C to B.</p><p>Right away, one difference is in the octave reduction.<br/>Neither the spring tuning nor the dissonance-based adaptive<br/>tuning moves notes all to the same octave. I can see that<br/>this would make calculations easier.</p><p>&gt; 2. I think (I hope) the basis of our position ideas is a little<br/>&gt; different to the others.

And it is correct understood: The first step is to compare<br/>the actual Note On situation with stored chord or interval<br/>structures in a table, the second step is to class the predetermined tuning<br/>values of a second table to the recognized chord structure.</p><p>But these two steps are not sufficient for a flexible and smart real time<br/>tuning programme.</p><p>There are three problems which have to be weighted:</p><p>1. It is definitely impossible to link all frequencies of all identic notes<br/>in different harmony sequences. With other words: One oftenly has<br/>to retune two or more notes inverse. If this has to be done legato,<br/>there will come up audible retuning steps as soon as you tune all these<br/>structures to absolute just intonation. (Just intonation understood as<br/>pure thirds and pure fifths, the natural sept, if desired, is a separate<br/>problem).</p><p>2. A real time program as Hermode Tuning is, cannot foreknow what the<br/>next Note On or Note Off message will bring as new note. You, as a<br/>keyboarder<br/>for instance intend to play a C major chord. But for the program it will be<br/>a<br/>sequence of Notes like C - E - G or G - E - C or E - G - C. The<br/>program cannot wait and has to retune in real time. Some of the problems<br/>are softened by the centering idea, but not all of them.</p><p>3. For practical aims the tuning values should stay as near as possible<br/>to ET. Hermode Tuning is created for making music in common with other<br/>instruments. Also instruments with fixed equal or near-to-equal temperament.</p><p>To 1.:<br/>A typical example is the progression from D-F-A-C to G-H(german B)-D-F.<br/>At the first chord you will have the Cent values -9, +7, -7, +9, in the<br/>second<br/>one the Cent values +4, -10, +6, 0. All Cent values as deviations from ET.<br/>In the second chord the F should be tuned as a double-sub-fifth to the G.<br/>Therefore, the Cent values from D change in default from -9 to + 6, these of<br/>F from<br/>+7 to 0. The sum is 22 Cents, the so called (in German:) &quot;Syntonisches<br/>Komma&quot;.<br/>I don&apos;t know the english name, is it &quot;Syntonic Komma&quot;????<br/>Now one has to decide: Hold the predetermined absolute values - than you<br/>have to divide the Syntonic Komma and to retune both, D and F by 11 Cents.<br/>this would be audible!!! -<br/>or to retune both by compromise means by inaudible steps of about 4 Cents.<br/>The result of the compromise will be that the second chord will  not be<br/>tuned<br/>to just intonation.<br/>Another example: Gliding from C-E-G# to C-E-G. C-E-G# is an augmented<br/>triad and cannot be tuned to just intonation. Hermode Tuning tunes such<br/>structures<br/>and other, known or unknown structures so that the horizontal line of<br/>frequencies<br/>will be as its best. But as a result of this the positions of  C-E in C-E-G#<br/>could be, for instance C = 0, E = +7. In C-E-G it should be C = +4, E = -10.<br/>The retuning step of both, C and E  would be in sum 21 Cents. The same<br/>problem<br/>as above. Reducing the retuning steps will bring audible beats by the<br/>incorrect<br/>tuned C major chord. Not reducing the steps will bring audible retuning<br/>effects.</p><p>To 2. :<br/>Every new played harmonic structure could begin with a message of a new<br/>third structure to the program. You intend to play C-E-G and touch first the<br/>keys C - E.<br/>C as first note will be indifferent, Cent value 0.<br/>C - E is a major third, Cent values C +7 / E -7. The Step 0 to +7 Cents  of<br/>the C could be audible. Now, as it is no &quot;inverse&quot; retuning problem, the<br/>program<br/>slightly will shift down the basic ET mastertune level by 4 Cents, so that<br/>the result will be C= +7-4 = 3 Cents, E = -7-3 = -10 Cents.<br/>If there follows C-E-G with +4/ -10/ +6 Cents in default, there will be no<br/>problem<br/>and the shifted mastertune level will jump back to its default position.</p><p>To 3.:<br/>The example of above (2.) shows, that it oftenly will be necessary to shift<br/>the mastertune level. Little shifts of 3 Cents as shown in the last example<br/>are no problem, but with other sequences of notes or chords the shifting<br/>values are higher. Therefore we try to avoid shifting when ever possible.<br/>We profit by the fact that the human ear requires some milliseconds until<br/>it will have realized the height of a tone. Or with other words: If the<br/>frequency<br/>of this tone changes within this time, this will be inaudible.<br/>This time difference is about 30 ms. Effectively the value is higher by<br/>deep tones, shorter by high tones, but 30 ms is a good compromise.<br/>(To avoid misunderstandings: You can realize the precise frequency even of a<br/>tone<br/>which is shorter than 30 ms, but only than, when he will not change<br/>its frequency and/ or within this time or will not be affected by a second<br/>one).<br/>This means: In the example, shown above (2.), we equalize only if the<br/>first C will exist alone by more than 30 ms.<br/>You may think that this problem is a little one, but in sum of all<br/>mastertune shifting means the mastertune level could quickly<br/>drift away and more than we want to permit.<br/>This means: Our program contents timer(s) which control how long every note<br/>exists and according to the different answers it decides if and how it<br/>equalizes<br/>- or not.</p><p>Now I told you the Hermode Tuning technology of 1988!!!</p><p>Weighting all the points described above you may become aware that<br/>for fine ears there may be something unsatisfying. Perfect just intonation<br/>is<br/>combined with audible retuning steps. Equalizing with the means<br/>described above causes hard changes between beatfree chords and others<br/>with audible beats. In this way Hermode Tuning is a good program and the<br/>user like it. And for orchestra sounds it is nearly perfect.<br/>But for clear sounds like church organ (We use church organ sounds for our<br/>tests) we haven&apos;t been completely pleased.<br/>You can imagine that we looked therefore for new ways for a rich<br/>temperament,<br/>near to just intonation but with less contrasts.</p><p>But this is a new chapter and would extend this letter in a way too much.<br/>Besides, with the help of diagrams it coud be understood much better.<br/>Therefore my question: Is it allowed to add diagrams, for instance as PDF,<br/>to<br/>these messages?<br/>Who can answer  this?</p><p>Kind regards</p><p>Werner</p><p>  -----Urspr&iuml;&iquest;&half;ngliche Nachricht-----<br/>  Von: Paul Erlich [<a href="mailto:paul@stretch-music.com">mailto:paul@stretch-music.com</a>]<br/>  Gesendet: Samstag, 29.

Some comments are incorrect. So<br/>please allow me to explain it in brief words.</p><p>The second reason is: We have posted on our website some musical files which<br/>could be interesting for testing your ears. See the annotations below.</p><p>Firstly: Hermode Tuning is written for a self-regulating tuning at<br/>electronic musical instruments and virtual instruments like sequencers<br/>combined with samplers, synths and so on.<br/>The presumption is that the referring music is multi voiced, written in<br/>western tradition, basing in chords and note combinations with thirds and<br/>fifths intervals. Hermode Tuning controls in real time, even at sequencers.<br/>It isn&apos;t prospective, this would bring less or nothing. The main problems of<br/>controlling the frequencies are caused by the incompatibility in principle<br/>of fifths and thirds when bringing them to just intonation. Hermode Tuning<br/>analyzes chords and note combinations and brings them to just intonation if<br/>any possible. The programme starts at every new not-on or note-off message<br/>and it combines three requirements: Optimal rapprochement to just<br/>intonation/ inaudible retuning steps/ frequency positions as near as<br/>possible to the line of equal temperament.<br/>Imagine that the default straight horizontal line of E.T. will be moved to a<br/>serpent, changing its figure ongoing, than you will get an idea how it<br/>works. The tuning values of this serpent are partial higher and partial<br/>deeper than the line of E.T. The average of all these deviations remains as<br/>near as possible to the value  &quot;0&quot;.<br/>Weighting inaudible retuning steps means that not in every moment the<br/>frequency ratios will be absolutely in accordance with the values of just<br/>intonation. At successive note combinations with four and more notes it can<br/>happen that the retuning steps have do be corrected in opposite.<br/>Besides, it is possible to reduce by default the depth of the correction<br/>values. In this way Hermode Tuning is more or less a &quot;living temperament&quot;.<br/>Some commentators claimed that Hermode Tuning is 3/5 limited. This is not<br/>correct. Correct is: One of our programme modes controls also to &quot;natural<br/>sevenths&quot; as soon as major seventh chords occur. But you all know: This<br/>natural seventh can cause audible retuning steps at harmonic sequences from<br/>subdominant chords to dominant-seventh chords. Therefore one has to weight<br/>carefully whether one should activate this mode.</p><p>Now to the musical files. You will find them at:<br/><a href="http://www.hermode.com/html/hermode-tuning-examples_en.html">www.hermode.com/html/hermode-tuning-examples_en.html</a></p><p>Some of them are created wit a note editing programme &quot;Capella&quot;, these files<br/>are a little stiff. Nevertheless I recommend for the opening of ears: Listen<br/>firstly to &quot;Vom Himmel hoch&quot; as the contrast between just intonation and<br/>E.T. there is very distinct.<br/>Additionally I recommend listen to Haydn&apos;s symphony no. 103, 1st movement.<br/>There in the introduction the single voiced bass line is broken three times<br/>by a chord sequence &quot;dominant seventh&quot; to &quot;major tonica&quot;. The file &quot;hermode&quot;<br/>is edited in 3/5 limit, therefore the chords sequence sound<br/>&quot;dissonant-consonat&quot;. The file &quot;hermode 7th&quot; is edited with the &quot;natural<br/>seventh&quot;, therefore this sequences sound &quot;nearly consonant - consonant&quot;. The<br/>file &quot;tempered&quot; is in E.T and sounds &quot;dissonant-dissonant&quot;. In abstract I<br/>prefer the 3/5 limit version, but indeed, with natural seventh it sounds<br/>very impressive.<br/>Last but not least listen to the two movements of Mozart&apos;s Piano Concerto KV<br/>488. The example &quot;hermode&quot; controls both, orchestra and piano, to just<br/>intonation. The file &quot;hmtmix&quot; controls the orchestra to just intonation, the<br/>piano remains in E.T. This last version is somehow in accordance with the<br/>real situation of human musicians on a well educated orchestra. Besides it<br/>shows that Hermode Tuning at such combinations is compatible to E.T. - and<br/>it sounds better than the all-E.T.-example.</p><p>Sorry, the orchestra samples are basing in a very little sample library,<br/>therefore the orchestral sound and the dynamic progressions sound not<br/>optimal. But actually I don&apos;t posses a better library.</p><p>Best</p><p>Werner Mohrlok</p></div><h3><a id=94772 href="#94772">ðŸ”—</a>Carl Lumma &#x3C;carl@...&#x3E;</h3><span>11/21/2010 2:33:51 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Werner wrote:</p><p>&gt; After a long time...</p><p>Yes, good to hear from you!
