The band would have been worth seeing solely as an example of the<br/>genre (which I&apos;m quite fond of, actually) of guitar-heavy creative<br/>blues-rock-heavymetal synthesis.  As a major bonus, adding in Jon and Brad&apos;s<br/>use of alternate tunings, chord arrangements, and matching vocals -- the<br/>experience was astounding.</p><p>I don&apos;t know what tuning or limits or any of that techie stuff Jon used, but<br/>the experience was amazing and I recommend that anyone interested in JI<br/>performance living in or near NYC take the opportunity to see them.  I&apos;m<br/>sure there&apos;s similar work going on elsewhere in the country (I have a<br/>cassette by Neil Haverstock, for instance) but I can only comment on the<br/>Catlers.  Well done.</p></div>
