<a href="/tuning">back to list</a><h1>my pitch reproduction abilities</h1><h3>John Starrett &#x3C;jstarret@carbon.cudenver.edu&#x3E;</h3><span>6/12/2001 6:25:43 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>I just ran a test on my pitch reproduction abilities. I imagined a pitch<br/>in my head then played it on my fretless acoustic bass guitar, recording<br/>it with Cool Edit Pro. I then listened to the recording, and recorded<br/>seven more of the same pitch, each time putting down the bass so that I<br/>had to find the note anew. I then extracted the pitch, averaging from<br/>the peak volume to where the level dropped to 20% of the max in each<br/>case. Here are the results in Hz. The first frequency listed is the<br/>reference:</p><p>231.57<br/>231.81<br/>231.29<br/>232.72<br/>231.70<br/>231.22<br/>231.84<br/>232.54</p><p>most of them are within 2-3 cents of the reference pitch. Not a<br/>statistically significant sample, and not in a musical context, but<br/>probably representative of my abilities. I am sure some list members can<br/>do even better ;-)</p><p>--<br/>John Starrett<br/>&quot;We have nothing to fear but the scary stuff.&quot;<br/>http:\<a href="http://www-math.cudenver.edu/~jstarret/microtone.html">www-math.cudenver.edu/~jstarret/microtone.html</a></p></div><h3>jpehrson@rcn.com</h3><span>6/12/2001 7:02:52 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In tuning@y..., John Starrett &lt;jstarret@c...&gt; wrote:</p><p><a href="http://groups.yahoo.com/group/tuning/message/24982">http://groups.yahoo.com/group/tuning/message/24982</a></p><p>Thank you for doing this, John....

I don&apos;t recall if Ezra ever wrote that in print anywhere<br/>(I think he did, but don&apos;t remember).  I got it directly from him,<br/>in a private letter he wrote me.</p><p>That&apos;s it in its essentials, but I wouldn&apos;t reproduce the actual<br/>quote without his permission.  He was making a point to me that<br/>it really doesn&apos;t concern him whether the performers are thinking<br/>in terms of 72-EDO or 37-limit JI, and that therefore he also<br/>really isn&apos;t much concerned with how his music is analyzed in<br/>these terms.  It works fine either way to his ears, and, I suspect,<br/>nearly everyone else&apos;s too.  (except maybe Johnny&apos;s?...  :)  )</p><p>The letter was mainly in response to what I wrote about his work<br/>in my book... I sent Sims an early draft several years ago.</p><p>-monz<br/><a href="http://www.monz.org">http://www.monz.org</a><br/>&quot;All roads lead to n^0&quot;</p><p>_________________________________________________________<br/>Do You Yahoo!?<br/>Get your free <a href="https://twitter.com/yahoo">@yahoo</a>.com address at <a href="http://mail.yahoo.com">http://mail.yahoo.com</a></p></div><h3>Afmmjr@aol.com</h3><span>6/12/2001 7:37:06 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Here&apos;s an experiment you can attempt.  I ask, can you hear to difference<br/>between an equal tempered perfect fifth of 700 cents and a 701.955etc. 3/2<br/>perfect fifth.</p><p>If the answer is yes, we go on.  Can you distinguish between the 2 perfect<br/>fifths well enough that you can sing them melodically?  If you can sing them<br/>in alternation, can you retain each of the different perfect fifths, now less<br/>than 2 cents apart?</p><p>If the answer is yes, and you can alternate between the 700 cents pitch and<br/>the 701.955etc. cents of the &quot;even more&quot; perfect fifth, can you sing the note<br/>in their middle?  If you can ascend with the added logarithmic middle of the<br/>&quot;less than 2 cents&quot; schisma, you would be moving by cent.</p><p>I just discussed this with Dave Eggar who agreed, though he had never thought<br/>about it before.  Skip LaPlante was hear, and heard, but he could distinguish<br/>what I heard as ascending.  Jon Catler announced 2-3 cents distinguishing<br/>ability on New Sounds last night.

My thought for you is that you could hear<br/>in your head something that your voice was apparently unwilling to honor.<br/>With practice, your voice could learn to be steadier.  Taking the voice to a<br/>Tuner will show a moving arrow for just about everybody, because it is so<br/>sensitive to fluctuation.   The bassoon holds the arrow flat.  But since<br/>vocalizing Partch&apos;s music, the voice became more sensitive and can emanate<br/>and dissolve.  Sometimes tuners are sensitive to any of the harmonics IN the<br/>tone.  Keeping a darker vocal sound might aid in registering a steady pointer.</p><p>Of course, John, you know much of this, but I thought it would be of interest<br/>to others.</p><p>Best, Johnny Reinhard</p><p>p.s. now it&apos;s to the studio to lay down the percussion of the Charles Ives<br/>&quot;Universe Symphony&quot; with Tom Goldstein.</p></div><h3>Paul Erlich &#x3C;paul@stretch-music.com&#x3E;</h3><span>6/13/2001 12:26:42 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Hi John.</p><p>I tried contacting you off-list . . . maybe it didn&apos;t work.</p><p>Did you ever receive the MAD DUXX CDs I sent you, kindly mastered by<br/>Jon Szanto?</p><p>You can reply off-list, unless you&apos;re announcing that you&apos;re adding<br/>something off those discs to Tuning Punks (which would be great).</p><p>Thanks,<br/>Paul</p></div><h3>Haresh BAKSHI &#x3C;hareshbakshi@hotmail.com&#x3E;</h3><span>6/13/2001 8:30:20 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Hello all members,  I, like all Indian musicians, tune my tanpura(s)<br/>several times a week.
