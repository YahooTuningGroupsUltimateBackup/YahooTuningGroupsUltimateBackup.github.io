We see<br/>too much creativity killed by bad or too strict and narrow-minded<br/>teachers. I was talking about a good teacher :-) Such teacher must be<br/>not only good in music theory and practice, but also in psychology...<br/>That means not to force young students, just show them other possible<br/>ways and help them to make their own way easier.</p><p>I was enough tortured in my childhood by unsensitive piano teacher<br/>who didn&apos;t understand that something like an improvisation creativity<br/>exists, and that musicality can have many forms... Yes, after so many<br/>years I understand that it was shocking for her to hear me<br/>improvising in piano etudes or change them because I felt they were<br/>boring... It&apos;s quite different approach to the music than that<br/>classical one, and not quite compatible. (Fortunately later I have<br/>found few classical piano virtuoso with improvising ability doing the<br/>same - improving classical works and doing their variations. )</p><p>Greetings to the proud father (you have good reason to be!) and<br/>talented son. I wish him lot of good notes.</p><p>If you are by chance in Czech Republic or near since 25.5 to 24.6.,<br/>we can meet, talk or make some musical noise which would be a<br/>pleasure for me.

In other words, what role can tuning &gt; play in improving a composer&apos;s chances of making/finding high-&gt; quality motifs?</p><p>All intervals are good and usable. Good melody usually combine more intervals, balance big and small intervals (classical rule for vocal polyphony - a jump in one direction should be filled with small steps in the other direction), has upper and lower peak (valley), is divided into periods (question - answer} etc. To me such spiral like melodies with balanced up and down intervals are the best.<br/>And as the melody is not the only and the most important music parameter, I don&apos;t think it&apos;s so important to try to find the best motif. What it means, the best motif? I don&apos;t think anything like this exists. Create just any motif and try to get the best of it by means of the other compositional work with it. Motif, motivic cell, it&apos;s just a word, a syllable of musical language. Context is more important - sentences, articles, pages, chapters... whole story... Look how many different motifs were invented, some of them are pretty banal but emotionally strong (lot of Classicism music use just arpeggiated chords as motif, but what they did with it!). Some other are well done but not so strong...</p><p>I personally like and sometimes use big intervals in the melody if I have such intention and need. Sometimes it&apos;s just a result of compositional work with originally narrow motif - by expanding the interval size. Of course one has to be carefully with singers and choirs, they prefer small intervals.</p><p>Different or unusual tuning can bring some new intervals, which can lead to bigger contrast, or just opposite - to the equalizing and flattening the contrast (if tuning is totally dissonant or totally consonant). On one side composer has more possibilities with fine tunings with many different pitches, on the other side it can make selection more difficult, and result can be just some &quot;out of tune&quot; music to an average listener.</p><p>&gt; &gt;&quot;Looking in the fakebook, I see now Hancock&apos;s Dolphin Dance, &gt; masterpiece of motivif cells method&quot;<br/>&gt; Hancock as in Herbie Hancock?

Just up and down, no work with motif. Even minor pentatonics offer much more to do. He hadn&apos;t best day with this :-) This I show to the students how not to do a melody.<br/>Try Jobim&apos;s Aqua de beber, or Corea&apos;s Crystal Silence, that&apos;s a real gem! Nothing to say about Bernstein&apos;s West Side Story, this is a paradise to analyse what he did.</p><p>&gt;   It gets me thinking, do you think perhaps the ability to make to &gt; make a tuning such that virtually all notes harmonize with all &gt; other notes so more ways to write polyphony (yes, I mean with &gt; several instruments and different voices) would help make it easier &gt; to write music &quot;like Herbie&quot;?</p><p>I don&apos;t understand this question.<br/>1. Such tuning will be pretty boring, without any contrast.</p><p>2. Even in 12ET all notes can be used with the other notes. I don&apos;t see any limitation for writing polyphony, why.</p><p>3. And if you mean by &quot;polyphony&quot; just more instruments playing together, then it&apos;s not so difficult. Remember that usually instruments have different roles in the arrangement - in pop/jazz there&apos;s usually melody, countermelody, riffs or fill-ins, harmony, bass, rhythm. For each of this layers we have lot of possibilities how to arrange them, depending on the music style, too. But this is an arrangement handcraft, which is only additional work. Main target is to find good melody and harmony, all the other things are derived from it and can be done in many ways. If the basic music is OK, then it can be arranged in any style, for any instruments, and always will sound well. (I recently did an arrangement of Janacek&apos;s intro fanfares from orchestral Sinfonietta with additional 9 trumpets just for flute, 6 Japanese koto, shamisen, biwa, piano and Japanese drums and the result is unbelievably good. Good music is undestroyable, bad music will be bad even in orchestral arrangement.)</p><p>4. Why to write music as Herbie? If you want, it&apos;s easy, but uninteresting - why just to follow what somebody else did before. More difficult is to try something more original.</p><p>&gt;   Not to say it can&apos;t be done 12TET (Herbie Hancock obviously does &gt; it)...but looking for ways micro-tonality could make it and things &gt; like improvising easier to accomplish.</p><p>I don&apos;t think so, it&apos;s quite opposite, microtonality is a complication for composer and listener. If you want  a simplicity, stay with pentatonics and diatonic scales. And don&apos;t hope there&apos;s an easy way to mastership in music. If you want some results you have to work hard and study a lot. Which is quite OK. How the hard working and many years studying masters with talent could be distinguished from lazy amateurs if learning music would be so easy :-}</p><p>Daniel Forro</p></div><h3><a id=89982 href="#89982">ðŸ”—</a>christopherv &#x3C;chrisvaisvil@...&#x3E;</h3><span>6/6/2010 8:32:52 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Sorry for the late reply.</p><p>I find this collection interesting.
