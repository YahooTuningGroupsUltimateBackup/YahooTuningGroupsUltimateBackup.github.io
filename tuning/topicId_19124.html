Here I&apos;m sure we<br/>agree that there is no intention to mislead, but unfortunately the<br/>best of intentions might not prevent what you have rightly described,<br/>Dave, as a real danger of misrepresenting your theoretical views.</p><p>As you may be suggesting in your reply, Dave, I was addressing the<br/>question of 17-tET &quot;set consistency&quot; for ratios of 2-3-7-9-11-13 in a<br/>neo-Gothic setting where unstable thirds and sixths of various sizes<br/>are arbitrarily tuned dyads, and combinations involving them<br/>&quot;polydyads,&quot; as one might say. Here a*b &gt; 105 would seem a relevant<br/>test, for those who wish to make a distinction of &quot;recognizability.&quot;</p><p>One reason why I prefer to speak of unstable &quot;triples&quot; and &quot;quads&quot;<br/>rather than &quot;triads&quot; and &quot;tetrads&quot; is to emphasize this point: this is<br/>_not_ a question of complex sonorities regarded as &quot;stable&quot; or &quot;fully<br/>concordant&quot; as in a Partchian n-limit system.</p><p>Of course, I would hasten to agree with you both, Paul and Dave, that you<br/>have not presented a*b &gt; 105 as an absolute limit of recognizability<br/>in the context of sonorities such as 16:19:24 or the even larger<br/>integer ratios of LaMonte Young&apos;s &quot;Dream House.&quot; Had I realized the<br/>potential for this kind of misunderstanding when I was writing the<br/>article, I would have added a prudent qualification -- as I now regret<br/>not doing.</p><p>My intention was to add a caution that in the context of the kind of<br/>music I make with complex unstable dyads and &quot;polydyads&quot; -- a<br/>qualification obvious to me, but not necessarily to some readers --<br/>the dyadic a*b &gt; 105 limit might raise questions of &quot;recognizability.&quot;</p><p>Possibly it might have been better not to have raised the point at<br/>all, since in leaning over backward to be modest about my use of large<br/>integer ratios or their tempered approximations, I may have lost my<br/>theoretical balance in presenting a distinction which is really alien<br/>to my philosophical and theoretical perspective, doing a service<br/>neither to &quot;recognizability&quot; theory nor to my own viewpoint and music.</p><p>Instances where a statement, if not given &quot;implicit&quot; qualification,<br/>could be seriously misleading or even invidiously discriminatory,<br/>arise frequently on this List. For example, consider a recent<br/>statement that contemporary singers often accept the tuning of a major<br/>third at 400 cents, although this is &quot;harsh.&quot; If we&apos;re talking about<br/>music of the 16th century in large portions of Europe, I would of<br/>course agree, as does Vincenzo Galilei when he finds 12-tET unpleasing<br/>on a harpsichord despite his advocacy of this &quot;perfect&quot; tuning as one<br/>of the virtues of his beloved lute.</p><p>For Gothic or neo-Gothic music, however, 400 cents might be described<br/>as a rather &quot;subdued&quot; major third, although it is, of course,<br/>categorically recognizable and can come up in tuning systems such as<br/>24-out-of-36-tET.</p><p>Some time ago, Kraig Grady contributed an article which caught my<br/>attention on the theme of letting each musical culture explain itself<br/>in its own terms. From now on, in discussing neo-Gothic music, I will<br/>try to focus on practice and theory from this point of view rather<br/>than getting involved in &quot;foreign entanglements&quot; with harmonic entropy<br/>theory or &quot;recognizability&quot; or the like.</p><p>Of course, anyone is free to apply these concepts to this music, just<br/>as they might be applied to Balinese gamelan or Georgian polyphony or<br/>the polyphony of the Dan people of Africa. However, by letting others<br/>do this rather than attempting to do it myself, I can at least<br/>minimize the risk of taking other people&apos;s concepts out of their<br/>original contexts and distorting either the concepts or the nature of<br/>my music, possibly both.</p><p>Specifically, I would like to declare my independence from<br/>&quot;recognizability&quot; theory for dyads or more complex constructions,<br/>leaving others, of course, free to pursue this kind of theory.</p><p>With Jacky Ligon -- if I am paraphrasing you accurately, Jacky, and<br/>please don&apos;t hesitate to correct or amend -- I would say that if an<br/>interval gives pleasure in a given musical context, it is<br/>&quot;recognizable&quot; in a way that counts.</p><p>As far as I&apos;m concerned, ratios such as 14:17:21 or 28:33:42 have a<br/>theoretical equality with constructions using the same odd factors in<br/>a more &quot;otonal&quot; or &quot;rooted&quot; fashion -- if this be rootless<br/>cosmopolitanism, let us make the most of it.</p><p>Most respectfully,</p><p>Margo Schulter<br/><a href="mailto:mschulter@value.net">mschulter@value.net</a></p></div><h3><a id=19139 href="#19139">ðŸ”—</a>ligonj@northstate.net</h3><span>2/20/2001 3:40:34 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In tuning@y..., &quot;M.

I was<br/>forced to abandon all this based upon the inherent realities and<br/>experience of creating multi-part compositions in Just Intonation,<br/>and the desire to make deliberate choices of ratio which fit the<br/>style of my music - which is very melodically based. In the unique<br/>context sensitive environment of actual music, where rhythm and<br/>melodic movement act to animate a tuning, by placing it on its own<br/>unique time map, and give it the life of composition, I constantly<br/>see the *rules (of thumb)* being broken, and the resulting music be<br/>completely harmonious - and *Just* sounding as an overall musical<br/>texture. Although I may be unable to describe why this is so, I know<br/>what my ears tell me, and we know how much *audible quality* is<br/>revered in this forum. I will join you on two points: 1. I would<br/>never denigrate anyone&apos;s desire to pursue any mode of<br/>theoretical/music exploration, and 2. I openly and unashamedly will<br/>pursue what is true to the language of my music - anything else is<br/>indeed alien and an injustice to the music.</p><p>&gt; With Jacky Ligon -- if I am paraphrasing you accurately, Jacky, and<br/>&gt; please don&apos;t hesitate to correct or amend -- I would say that if an<br/>&gt; interval gives pleasure in a given musical context, it is<br/>&gt; &quot;recognizable&quot; in a way that counts.</p><p>You couldn&apos;t have spoken my heart any more accurately and eloquently,<br/>than if it were your own. It is the only kind that has any<br/>significance to my practice and experience. The &quot;recognizability&quot;<br/>issue is dead for me - and here is the reason: Behind allot of this<br/>theory, we see great effort to *narrow* the field of choices, by<br/>declaring limits to our perceptions of this and that &quot;odd&quot;<br/>or &quot;prime&quot;. I believe it all goes much deeper than this. The act of<br/>hearing and mentally deciphering full music is much more complex,<br/>than simple models will ever reveal. Music just won&apos;t stand still and<br/>obey the rules we want to impose, because every piece of music is<br/>different, every context is different, every composer and musical<br/>listener is different, and the choices of timbre could change<br/>radically every time. And chords analyzed outside of musical context,<br/>without the elements of rhythm and timbre taken into consideration<br/>are a futile exercise, which only reveals something about the nature<br/>of the thing being studied in isolation. &quot;Recognizability&quot; as a means<br/>to narrow the field, has no meaning to my music reality. My choices<br/>are deliberate, and different dependent upon the colors I choose to<br/>use on my canvas of sound. Perhaps it&apos;s a bit stubborn of me, but<br/>this sonic picture I paint, with intervals I&apos;ve been using for quite<br/>a long, long time.</p><p>On the wonderful and informative occasion, when you and I compared<br/>the ratios we commonly use in the area of the Minor Third and Major<br/>Third, I realized I had met someone who had such a deep and intimate<br/>musical understanding of the language of the ratios. We found that we<br/>favored a number of the same *flavors*, and where I was unfamiliar<br/>with yours, new and exciting possibilities expanded for me. All this<br/>is to say, that I found immense common ground in that you had this<br/>rich vocabulary and command over deliberate use of ratio, for the<br/>context of your music. In no small way did it surprise and delight me<br/>to find another that has learned the sound of many flavors of ratio<br/>over the course of years of musical practice, and knows how to<br/>harness their harmonic and melodic possibilities within the context<br/>of personal style.</p><p>To intimately know what it sounds like, and to make music with it, to<br/>me it is the ultimate goal. Once a composer/performer has command of<br/>this language (where one chooses JI as their path), and has<br/>internalized the intervals, nothing is arbitrary, or incorrect in<br/>some context outside the logic of its own being, but are deliberate<br/>and calculated. This comes out of years of *hands on instrument*<br/>music and scale making, where Spirit, Body and Mind are trained to<br/>channel lasting works of music art. I&apos;m sure Haresh could speak to<br/>this, as a trained Hindustani vocalist.</p><p>&gt; As far as I&apos;m concerned, ratios such as 14:17:21 or 28:33:42 have a<br/>&gt; theoretical equality with constructions using the same odd factors<br/>in<br/>&gt; a more &quot;otonal&quot; or &quot;rooted&quot; fashion -- if this be rootless<br/>&gt; cosmopolitanism, let us make the most of it.</p><p>We should follow our hearts and ears and let music practice be the<br/>guide to the truths of microtonal music, while at the same time<br/>cherishing the right for others to do things in their own way, and<br/>speak of it within their own personal language and musical style. And<br/>when we find that others speak in a different stylistic language,<br/>which may be based largely upon empirical music experiences, we<br/>should look closer at the living realizations of the microtonal<br/>music, and not construe that they may be anti-mathematical by<br/>expressing a view which is unique to the individual. I would dare say<br/>there are few who have worked in this area for years, and have<br/>repeatedly transposed the theory onto finished pieces of music, that<br/>do not have sufficient math ability to get the job done. These same<br/>composers may reveal other personal musical realities, which are<br/>valid but less mathematically toned. I do not find myself listening<br/>to East Indian classical music for mathematical purposes (except<br/>where I may enjoy counting the taala), but for the blissful beauty of<br/>melodic improvisation. If I can just capture some small portion of<br/>this essence in my own music, I will consider it an achievement.</p><p>Thanks for this wonderful post,</p><p>Jacky Ligon</p></div>
