In fact, Indian<br/>musicians today continue to use and argue over just versus tempered<br/>intervals. Certainly the ancient Greeks and Persians knew of the existence<br/>of irrationals (perhaps John Chalmers could provide some details), and<br/>Aristoxenus spoke to their use in scales. Though some kind of &quot;harmony&quot; in<br/>the broadest since may exist in these musics (as with the Indian drones), I<br/>think Kraig&apos;s point is a good one.
