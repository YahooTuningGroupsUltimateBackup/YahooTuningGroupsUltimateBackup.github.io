I&apos;m not equipped well enough mathematically to pursue this much farther, but I certainly did not intend that my &quot;constructive&quot; approach had nothing to do with sound. Indeed, I find it has everything to do with the process of making sounds, even if the intended ideal is not (or never) physically realized.</p><p>In my opinion, composers have always wrestled with musical arrangements of sounds that were generally understood at the time to be incomprehensible, and the best composers have had the invention to find ways of making these sounds even more than simply comprehensible: Beethoven&apos;s Grosse Fuge was considered both unplayable and inaudible, but playing technique evolved to meet the challenge, while listeners discovered unused capacities. Sometimes crossing barriers of perception will require drastically changing the circumstances of music making: Conlon Nancarrow&apos;s complex canons demanded an alternative instrumentation (the player piano, although a number of these pieces are now played bu human pianists), La Monte Young&apos;s complexes of sines in higher rational relationship depends upon electronics, extended durations, and perhaps perception of sounds through senses more spatial than acoustic.  And Alvin Lucier has discovered a number of elegant ways to make music from phenomena (brain waves, interference beating, room and object resonances) that were generally assumed to be too subtle for musical use. I agree that there is a defineable extent and limit to our musical perception, but I believe that (a) it is not yet defined, and (b) that definition has to be a dynamic one (and yeah -- our hearing could get worse as well: I recently received a sample of music as heard with a cochlear implant. Pitch discrimation reduced to a band of about a major third in width. Sarah Vaughan sounded like she was rapping. In fact, with an implant, everything sounds like rap...)</p><p>Finally, I appreciate your appeal for attempting to define Just Intonation by extrapolating from the sound itself. However, and reiterating my point about process instead of product, there is simply no single &quot;sound of just intonation&quot; from which to begin.  When it comes to real musical materials, I am neither willing to play interval policeman with someone elese&apos;s music nor let someone else play interval policeman with my music.  And I&apos;m afraid that your idea about starting from a determination about which intervals are Just and which are not, is, absent from a real compositional context, let alone any of the potential contexts in which music might be made, not musically meaningful.</p><p>DJW</p></div><h3><a id=58918 href="#58918">ðŸ”—</a>Dave Keenan &#x3C;d.keenan@bigpond.net.au&#x3E;</h3><span>6/6/2005 8:33:57 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, Daniel Wolf &lt;djwolf@s...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt; Reply to Dave Keenan:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I had hoped that by using the term &quot;constructive&quot; in connection with my<br/>&gt; idea that Just Intonation is more process than product, you would&apos;ve<br/>&gt; picked up on some relationship to intutionism<br/>...</p><p>OK.

But in going to larger and larger whole-numbers in your ratios<br/>there comes a point where absolutely anything is within 1/3 of a cent<br/>(or whatever threshold you choose) of such a ratio. e.g. 51/50 and<br/>52/51 are only 2/3 of a cent apart.</p><p>If someone tells me that a piece is in 7-limit JI then I know<br/>something about what I am about to hear, but if they tell me it is in<br/>19-limit JI I may well be about to hear something I can&apos;t tell from<br/>12-equal (which isn&apos;t to say that a clever composer couldn&apos;t make the<br/>distinction between 12-equal and its best 19-limit approximation<br/>audible, however I don&apos;t think that anyone can make the difference<br/>between 12-equal and its best 1001-limit approximation audible).</p><p>&gt; The spiraling of numbers as with Pythagorean 3-limit and the 19-tET<br/>&gt; culmination of 6/5 minor thirds are a different &quot;take&quot; on JI.

It seems to me the opposite is true; if you<br/>produce sounds with a system like Csound, it seems to me you&apos;d get<br/>increasingly slow beats, until you&apos;d have to sustain the chord for a<br/>ridiculous time to tell there was a beat, yet beat there will be. In<br/>any case, asking for complete absence of slow beats in sustained<br/>intervals does get you awfully close to rational intervals. Just<br/>listening to the soundcard product of a midi file seems to allow for<br/>very slow beats also, actually. Yet in a normal musical passage, you<br/>can&apos;t hear them.</p></div>
