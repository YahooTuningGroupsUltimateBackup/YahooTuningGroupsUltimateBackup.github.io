No, that&apos;s not a laughable conception... it has ONLY BEEN<br/>around for the last 5 years... at least in great popularity (post<br/>it&apos;s early use for scientific exchange).

Seems<br/>to me like we&apos;ve gone right back to hieroglyphics again!!</p><p>AFAIK, no one&apos;s ever noticed this before...</p><p>Lest anyone think this is off-topic, I believe that it relates<br/>very much to problems of notating music, especially microtonal<br/>music.  I sometimes view my own lattice diagrams are another<br/>sort of iconic representation.</p><p>-monz<br/><a href="http://www.ixpres.com/interval/monzo/homepage.html">http://www.ixpres.com/interval/monzo/homepage.html</a><br/>&apos;All roads lead to n^0&apos;</p></div>
