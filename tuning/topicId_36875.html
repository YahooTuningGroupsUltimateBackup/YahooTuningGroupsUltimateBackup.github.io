The listing of the CPS has resulted in an unfortunate situation. Whereas Wilson went through much pains to place his structure at a specific pitch among other reasons to give a just major scale on C. The way it is listed with the 1-3-5 on A=440 has resulted in Alison Monteith tuning her instrument in a different key than either mine, Zelenz and probably Dan Wolfs.  I imagine that it would be good to also make sure that the diamond is listed in reference to G. Having such tunings occur as rarely as they do i stress the<br/>importance to have the music written for in be interchangeable as mush as possible. Even though Alison has correctly noted that it is only a about a minor third away, looking over my piece using the Bassoon with tubes places the composition outside of it range. I understand that scala was never meant to be a reference to tuning acoustic instruments. I hope that in the future we can prevent such things from happening.  imagine all type of diamonds built to different reference to tones of 12 ET. it makes me shutter.</p><p>&gt;<br/>&gt; Message: 4<br/>&gt;    Date: Tue, 07 May 2002 12:33:54 -0000<br/>&gt;    From: &quot;danmozell&quot; &lt;<a href="mailto:dan@danmozell.com">dan@danmozell.com</a>&gt;<br/>&gt; Subject: Re: Scala and starting frequencies<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; --- In tuning@y..., manuel.op.de.coul@e... wrote:<br/>&gt; &gt; danmozell wrote:<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt;Is there a list somewhere of<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt;standard or typical starting frequencies for the various historical<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt;tunings?<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; Typically you choose the starting frequency so that A=440.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt;Do most computer programs that use Scala files give the user<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt;the option of choosing the starting frequency?<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; Yes.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; Manuel<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Thanks Manuel.
