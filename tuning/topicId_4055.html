Many<br/>&#x9;proper P maysatisfy this requirement.  If the stimuli are<br/>&#x9;sufficiently unfamiliar (as when one listens to music of an alien<br/>&#x9;culture) many repeated hearings may be necessary during which a<br/>&#x9;listener replaces a familiar P with one more appropriate for<br/>&#x9;classifying the stimuli heard.  The cardinality of the constructed<br/>&#x9;P will depend upon the numbers of distinctions required by the<br/>&#x9;particular musical language or, if the stimuli are not musical,<br/>&#x9;upon the fineness of discrimination required by the recognition<br/>&#x9;task to be performed.</p><p>Once an appropriate P has been found, the next step is to locate a stimulus<br/>within it...</p><p>&#x9;Given any &quot;interval&quot; (pair) in P, the listener is able to<br/>&#x9;recognize the possible positions its elements might occupy in P.<br/>  &#x9;In effect, given any pair of elements he can mentally supply<br/>&#x9;(interpolate) a possible set of remaining elements of P which<br/>&#x9;satisfy the equivalence class and tuning he has learned.  Such an<br/>&#x9;interpolation becomes unique after a sufficient number of elements<br/>&#x9;of P are heard.  This is equivalent to the identification of x<br/>&#x9;(key) in a give P(x).</p><p>&#x9;For example, the major triad [C E G] is not a sufficient subset of<br/>&#x9;the C-major scale since there are two other major scales (namely G<br/>&#x9;and F) in which it occurs.  But C-major is the only major scale<br/>&#x9;which contains the four notes [G B D F], so the &quot;dominant seventh<br/>&#x9;chord&quot; is a sufficient subset of C-major.  A minimal set is a<br/>&#x9;sufficient set with no sufficient subsets.  Thus, [G B D F] is not<br/>&#x9;a minimal set, but [G B F] is, as there is no major scale except C<br/>&#x9;which contains [G B F], while each of its proper subsets [G B] [G<br/>&#x9;F] [B F] are included in some other major scale (G, F, and F#<br/>&#x9;respectively).</p><p>&#x9;It is straightforward to verify that sufficient (and therefore<br/>&#x9;minimal) sets are invariants of equivalence.  They depend only on<br/>&#x9;the equivalence class, not on the particular tuning.</p><p>A measure is developed for this locating...</p><p>&#x9;Consider a language whose alphabet consists of n letters (or<br/>&#x9;phonemes).  How many distinct words can be formed using this<br/>&#x9;alphabet?  Certain restrictions may exist which can limit the<br/>&#x9;sequences of letters that can occur.  The more distinct words that<br/>&#x9;can be formed whose length is less than or equal to some maximal<br/>&#x9;value, the more efficient the alphabet is said to be.</p><p>&#x9;A similar situation applies when &quot;words&quot; are formed from sequences &#x9;of<br/>intervals.  Since interval sequences are formed from tone<br/>&#x9;sequences, we consider sequences of the elements of some P.  Also,<br/>&#x9;since no new intervals are formed when an element is repeated,<br/>&#x9;only non-repeating sequences will be considered.  Since we are<br/>&#x9;here concerned only with properties deriving from the structure of<br/>&#x9;P, we will use the following criterion for the termination of a<br/>&#x9;&quot;word&quot; (other criteria apply when &quot;motifs&quot; are considered): When<br/>&#x9;all remaining elements of P are determined by a sequence of some<br/>&#x9;of its elements, the addition of elements will impart no further<br/>&#x9;information of this type, and the &quot;word&quot; will be considered<br/>&#x9;terminated.  That is, any sequence will be considered complete as<br/>&#x9;soon as a sufficient set occurs in it.</p><p>&#x9;We now ask, given a particular equivalence class, how many<br/>&#x9;distinct words can be formed using k elements where k varies from<br/>&#x9;1 to n.  Consider all non-repeating sequences of n points (there<br/>&#x9;are n! such sequences).  Let S_i be the number of elements in each<br/>&#x9;such sequence which must appear before a sufficient set is<br/>&#x9;encountered.  The F(P) is defined as the average,</p><p>&#x9;n!<br/>&#x9;Sigma(S_i) / n!<br/>&#x9;i=1</p><p>&#x9;F(P) may be interpreted as the average number of elements in a non-<br/>&#x9;repeating sequence of n elements of P(x) required to determine the<br/>&#x9;key, x.  Efficiency, E, is defined as F(P)/n and Redundancy, R, as<br/>&#x9;1 - F(P)/n.  Both numbers lie between 0 and 1.</p><p>&#x9;It should be noted that this kind of efficiency and redundancy<br/>&#x9;differs from the meanings these terms assume in information<br/>&#x9;theory.  The distinction is important and applies to alphabets in<br/>&#x9;spoken natural languages as well as to musical scales.  The<br/>&#x9;redundancy of information theory refers to a redundancy in the<br/>&#x9;message, not in the code.  In our discussion here, that property<br/>&#x9;of the code which determines whether efficient messages _can_ be<br/>&#x9;constructed (if such are desired) is considered.  This property is<br/>&#x9;inherent in the code itself, and does not apply to the message.</p><p>Rothenberg outlines six scenarios...</p><p>&#x9;  Scale type  Stability    Efficiency<br/>&#x9;(a)  proper       high         high<br/>&#x9;(b)  proper       high         low<br/>&#x9;(c)  proper       low          high<br/>&#x9;(d)  proper       low          low<br/>&#x9;(e)  improper     ----         high<br/>&#x9;(f)  improper     ----         low</p><p>And discusses them...</p><p>&#x9;Notice that in Figure 1, all scales in 12tET with which we are<br/>&#x9;most familiar (the major, minor, and Chinese pentatonic) conform<br/>&#x9;to situation (a).  In fact, the major scale (of which the<br/>&#x9;&quot;natural&quot; minor is a mode) is far higher in both stability and<br/>&#x9;efficiency than any other 7-tone scale.  Next among 7-tone scales<br/>&#x9;is the &quot;melodic&quot; minor (2,2,2,2,1,2,1).  The Chinese pentatonic<br/>&#x9;stands out among scales of 5 and 6 tones.</p><p>&#x9;However, situation (b) applies to many scales with which we are &#x9;familiar,<br/>such as the &quot;whole-tone&quot; and &quot;12-tone&quot; scales.  Note<br/>&#x9;that while these are strictly proper scales, from the hearing of a<br/>&#x9;sufficient set (any element) alone, it is not possible to code the<br/>&#x9;elements of P into scale degrees.  That is, although PxP is coded<br/>&#x9;by the proper mapping, there is no way to index elements of P<br/>&#x9;except by arbitrary choice.  __Thus, since in these cases<br/>&#x9;intervals are coded but tones are not, composition with these<br/>&#x9;scales must involve relations which make use of motivic<br/>&#x9;similarities rather than relations between scale degrees.__  Hence<br/>&#x9;the tone row basis of 12-tone music (which is essentially motivic<br/>&#x9;in concept) is not surprising.  An examination of Debussy&apos;s whole-<br/>&#x9;tone piano prelude &quot;Violes&quot; show similar motivic dependency.</p><p>&#x9;Now consider improper scales.  PxP is not coded except by the<br/>&#x9;employment of proper subsets or a fixed tonic.  __Hence<br/>&#x9;information is primarily communicated by the scale degrees.__<br/>  &#x9;Thus it is important that P be coded as quickly as possible, which<br/>&#x9;is indicated by a high redundancy (low efficiency) as in case<br/>&#x9;(f).  It would be expected that scales characterized by case (e)<br/>&#x9;would be extremely difficult to use, except when the tonic is<br/>&#x9;fixed by a drone or similar device and, in fact, we have not<br/>&#x9;discovered such scales in any musical culture examined thus far.<br/>&#x9;In general, the use of motivic sequences on different scale<br/>&#x9;degrees of improper scales would not be expected (except within<br/>&#x9;proper subsets of such scales), and this is strongly supported by<br/>&#x9;examination of Indian and other music using improper scales.</p><p>&#x9;We would also expect that proper scales characterized by low<br/>&#x9;stability would tend to be used as improper scales, so that case<br/>&#x9;(c) would resemble case (e), and (d) resemble (f), and similar<br/>&#x9;remarks apply.</p><p>Makes cross-cultural observations...</p><p>&#x9;In Java there exist two scale systems, &quot;Slendro&quot; and &quot;Pelog&quot;, each<br/>&#x9;containing a variety of scales.  It has been observed that all<br/>&#x9;scales in the &quot;Slendro&quot; class are strictly proper and that all in<br/>&#x9;the &quot;Pelog&quot; class are improper.  In a study conducted with the<br/>&#x9;assistance of Mr. Surya Brata of the Ministry of Education and<br/>&#x9;Culture, Jakarta, the uses of these scale systems were observed to<br/>&#x9;be in accord with the predictions of this model.</p><p>References to the Javanese study...</p><p>&#x9;Kunst, J.
