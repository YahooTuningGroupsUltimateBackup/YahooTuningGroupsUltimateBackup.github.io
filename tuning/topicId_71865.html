So going around the circle of fifths:</p><p>C       0.000<br/>G     698.045<br/>D     196.090<br/>A     894.135<br/>E     392.180<br/>B    1094.135<br/>F#    596.090<br/>C#     98.045<br/>G#/Ab 798.045<br/>Eb    298.045<br/>Bb    998.045<br/>F     501.955</p><p>So the fifths tempered narrow by 1/6 of a comma are 698.045 cents, and the fifths tempered narrow by 1/12 of a comma are 700.000 cents. The single fifth Bb-F is actually tempered wide by 1/12 of a comma, which works out to be 703.910 cents.</p><p>I think it&apos;s actually easier to compare tunings like this by comparing how the fifths are tempered in fractions of a comma; e.g. comparing Lehman&apos;s Bach tuning to Sorge&apos;s tuning from 1758:</p><p>        C-G  G-D  D-A  A-E  E-B  B-F# F#-C# C#-G# Ab-Eb Eb-Bb Bb-F  F-C<br/>Lehman -1/6 -1/6 -1/6 -1/6   0    0    0   -1/12 -1/12 -1/12 +1/12 -1/6<br/>Sorge  -1/6 -1/6 -1/6 -1/12  0  -1/12 -1/12   0  -1/12 -1/12 -1/12   0</p></div><h3><a id=71879 href="#71879">ðŸ”—</a>Andreas Sparschuh &#x3C;a_sparschuh@yahoo.com&#x3E;</h3><span>6/15/2007 7:34:05 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, Herman Miller &lt;hmiller@...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; J.Smith asked:<br/>&gt; &gt; I&apos;d like to know what all the fuss is about....??<br/>The history behind is documented in:<br/><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Well-Tempered_Clavier">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Well-Tempered_Clavier</a><br/>there under the topic: &quot; What tuning did Bach intend?&quot;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; the circle of fifths:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; C       0.000<br/>&gt; G     698.045<br/>&gt; D     196.090<br/>&gt; A     894.135<br/>&gt; E     392.180<br/>&gt; B    1094.135<br/>&gt; F#    596.090<br/>&gt; C#     98.045<br/>&gt; G#/Ab 798.045<br/>&gt; Eb    298.045<br/>&gt; Bb    998.045<br/>&gt; F     501.955<br/>&gt;<br/>critial review in:<br/><a href="http://em.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/full/34/4/613">http://em.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/full/34/4/613</a>?<br/>maxtoshow=&amp;HITS=10&amp;hits=10&amp;RESULTFORMAT=&amp;fulltext=ortgies&amp;searchid=1&amp;<br/>FIRSTINDEX=0&amp;resourcetype=HWCIT</p><p>&gt; So the fifths tempered narrow by 1/6 of a comma are 698.045 cents,<br/>and<br/>&gt; the fifths tempered narrow by 1/12 of a comma are 700.000 cents.<br/>The<br/>&gt; single fifth Bb-F is actually tempered wide by 1/12 of a comma,<br/>which<br/>&gt; works out to be 703.910 cents.<br/>most experts consider L&apos;s modern 1/12 PC step-wide as to coarse<br/>especially for J.S.

Maybe these same ones.  (I&apos;m just not a big fan of using cents, personally, because I believe they don&apos;t give us particularly clear information when talking about 17th-18th century material!  Comma splits are much clearer, at least to me.  The 17th-18th century people did not use cents, as the unit hadn&apos;t been invented yet.  Several *did* use the approximately 2-cent interval of a schisma, i.e. 1/12 Pythagorean comma or 1/11 syntonic comma, as their basic unit: Neidhardt and Sorge, principally, in their tables that present the sizes of all 12 major 3rds, and their tables that describe the tempering of 5ths.  They use 0, 1, 2, or 3 of this schisma unit.)</p><p>To &quot;learn what the fuss is about&quot;, isn&apos;t another good way by listening to the recorded samples?  :)</p><p>Sorry about your hair!</p><p>If there were some simpler way of presenting the material, for people who don&apos;t fancy reading the expositions first, I&apos;m open to suggestions.

I wonder if we get bored, and someone just mentions it to start a hot topic again. It&apos;s like mentioning abortion or gay marriage at a Baptist family reunion.</p><p>Anyway, good thoughts, Tom. I would add that I think Brad seems like a good guy, smart, interesting, etc. And an able musician. I disagree with his conclusion strongly, however, like you do, that Bach should only work in his tuning, and that somehow we weren&apos;t &apos;getting&apos; Bach before he let us see the colors.</p><p>In this and other discussions, I would refer you to the blind audio tests I did a while back using a Bach piece. I think I proved that these differences between various WTs are tiny enough to fool people into thinking the audibly best one is the one they hate the most _on paper_. I will stand by the results of these tests again and again. Johnny Reinhard didn&apos;t think WerckIII was the best, and I think Brad didn&apos;t recognize his own tuning, and preferred another. Granted, it *was* an electronic sample rendition, but it was good enough, I think, in spite of the inevitable caveats that followed.</p><p>I was also a victim--WerckIII sounded decent enough to me, although not my favorite by far, even though I fought against it on paper.......perhaps this whole business of caring all that much is a bit silly!? Anyway, that&apos;s what I brought away from my tests....Bach sounded anywhere from fascinatingly and grotesquely &apos;off&apos; (interesting for it&apos;s own sake, I think) to passable to very fine in a variety of tunings, and it seems that at least some of this might be accountable to individual taste, which is to me how it should be. Most agreed that whatever the truth of Brad&apos;s assertions, his tuning suits Bach well. Ditto, for me, Francis&apos;s tunings, which Brad despises. Anyway---I&apos;m not much into finding &apos;the one true tuning&apos; to invest my entire being into...I don&apos;t get that point of view, but I want to be careful not to dismiss it either--to each his own, as they say.</p><p>Yes, 19/15 is a good ratio, I&apos;ve made a couple of temperaments using it. I&apos;m fond of one that uses 5/4,24/19, and 19/15. Check the Scala archives for this and others. I don&apos;t under what conditions I&apos;d ever be able to do 19/15 by ear; I&apos;m doubtful, but I also haven&apos;t tried very hard.</p><p>Speaking of 19/15 vs. 81/64---have you ever done my listening test about trying to distinguish between them? I was amazed that a couple of folks around here could...however, it really wasn&apos;t designed to be a large enough random sample---I think the results would be stronger and more convincing if I did it for many more trials.</p><p>-A.</p><p>Tom Dent wrote:<br/>&gt; Libel?

That&apos;s a new one on me. Please specify where the supposed libel<br/>&gt; occurs. (Libel means a personal remark which is both derogatory and<br/>&gt; deliberately dishonest.)<br/>&gt;</p><p>Among several definitions for &quot;libel&quot; in my MS Bookshelf British Reference<br/>Collection, I choose &quot;any malicious defamatory publication or statement&quot;.</p><p>The abstract in question, one can clearly discern the ill-will of the<br/>authors in such remarks as:</p><p>&quot;The premise that a mathematically rigid tuning-scheme is hidden cryptically<br/>in a decorative scroll on the title-page of WTC I is daft...&quot;</p><p>&quot;Lehman&apos;s idea that Bach&apos;s secret tuning is uniquely beautiful for music by<br/>Frescobaldi et al. is outlandish.&quot;</p><p>(Brad refutes ever having stated as such)</p><p>&gt; Early Music, notoriously, asks for its authors to express their theses<br/>&gt; or opinions strongly and unequivocally. That&apos;s what Brad did in his<br/>&gt; articles, telling us how sure he was that Bach must have used this<br/>&gt; particular tuning, and how we should all use it too all the time.<br/>&gt;</p><p>He has demonstrated with skill that his conclusions may have a bearing, and<br/>may not be summarily dismissed. I support his convictions based on pure<br/>scholarly pursuit (to the detriment of the orthodoxy), even if I don&apos;t share<br/>his passions.</p><p>&gt; Was this a good or a bad thing? How would one know? I think it is a<br/>&gt; bad thing if it is not definitely correct, but nevertheless causes<br/>&gt; many people to believe that the question is settled, and to play Bach<br/>&gt; henceforth in only this one tuning, to the exclusion of others, and<br/>&gt; even of their own research and creativity.</p><p>It is his conviction that Bach has intended for this tuning, and historical<br/>performance would then necessitate such a tuning per se. There is nothing<br/>wrong with holding such a position if one can produce convincing<br/>demonstrations and proof, which Brad has done I believe.</p><p>I think it also is a bad<br/>&gt; thing if people follow a supposedly historical claim without knowing<br/>&gt; how much uncertainty it carries. (Which also happened with previous<br/>&gt; supposely historical &apos;Bach tunings&apos;...) I also think it is a bad thing<br/>&gt; for history and performance practice if methods of research are<br/>&gt; adopted which depend to a great extent on the writer&apos;s personal tastes<br/>&gt; or whims, and systematically confuse personal taste with historical<br/>&gt; evidence.</p><p>But music is the goal here, not a simple side-effect of theory. Brad is<br/>convinced that Bach would demand the best temperament for his music, and<br/>goes on to show that the composer has taken the trouble to scribble it down<br/>in the one place where hardly anybody bothered to look. It is fascinating<br/>enough that a crude squiggle could yield such a beautifully resonating<br/>temperament in the first place.</p><p>&gt;<br/>&gt; Now we have Lindley and Ortgies telling us that Lehman&apos;s historical<br/>&gt; methods are bad and are very unlikely to give any good idea of Bach&apos;s<br/>&gt; tuning or tunings.<br/>&gt;</p><p>Which Brad refutes in his lengthy reprisals.</p><p>&gt; Is this a good or a bad thing? If they are correct, then it is a good<br/>&gt; thing, whether they express themselves politely or rudely. If it<br/>&gt; causes people to think carefully about accepting pre-mixed temperament<br/>&gt; recipes, and to start using their ears carefully instead, it might<br/>&gt; also be a good thing. It would only be a bad thing if their arguments<br/>&gt; are definitely weaker than Brad&apos;s.<br/>&gt;</p><p>How established is this Bach-scholarship on tuning anyway? Brad questions<br/>the orthodoxy, and points out several crucial points to his favour as far as<br/>I can read. It is a bad show if, instead of sound criticism, we are<br/>countenanced by such defamations as &quot;daft&quot; and &quot;outlandish&quot; based on Allah<br/>knows what.</p><p>&gt; So what is the problem with well-qualified people expressing, in plain<br/>&gt; language, negative opinions about other people&apos;s claims of historical<br/>&gt; research, if they can put forward clearly comprehensible arguments why<br/>&gt; it is bad?<br/>&gt;</p><p>It is bad if they do not suggest anything more convincing, or if their whole<br/>pursuit is to kindle senseless bigotry.</p><p>&gt; How would one know whether or not Lindley and Ortgies give serious<br/>&gt; examination to the question, without reading the article? An abstract<br/>&gt; can only point roughly to the conclusions, without giving a full<br/>&gt; account of the reasoning.<br/>&gt;</p><p>An abstract gives away the intent of the authors. Brad seems to be justified<br/>in his retort. Though somewhat unacademic in language, I personally found it<br/>quite amusing and to the point.</p><p>&gt; The situation is rather asymmetrical in that everything on Brad&apos;s<br/>&gt; website (which is naturally enough arranged to let him have the last<br/>&gt; word) can be publicly seen - whereas the Lindley article is only<br/>&gt; available to subscribers of Early Music. One may try to peruse Brad&apos;s<br/>&gt; comments on the Lindley article on his own webpage. But do you think<br/>&gt; it is possible or likely that Brad will accurately and fairly<br/>&gt; summarize the arguments of his own most powerful critics?<br/>&gt;</p><p>It is indeed asymmetrical if some people tend to exploit such reputed<br/>journals as Early Music to scratch &quot;unorthodox newbies&quot; through adversely<br/>influencing hundreds of venerable readers who do not use the internet. Early<br/>Music must now make room for Brad to express himself if it hopes to be<br/>impartial.</p><p>&gt; One should at least suspect whether *both* sides might not be engaged<br/>&gt; in doing everything possible to prove the other guy wrong. And whether<br/>&gt; clearly displayed opinions are better or worse than biases hidden<br/>&gt; under a mound of formal analysis.<br/>&gt;</p><p>I enjoy such expositions to my own amusement. On the whole, I would prefer<br/>unbiased academical study and criticism. One should never revert to hurtful<br/>language there of course.</p><p>&gt; .....<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Where is Bach in all this? If the result is that performers&apos; options<br/>&gt; in tuning their instruments ever more restricted (as Brad is, in fact,<br/>&gt; arguing for), I would say Bach is the victim. Since I believe that<br/>&gt; Bach can sound perfectly good in many dozens of different - but not<br/>&gt; vastly different! - tunings, I think it would be a great shame if this<br/>&gt; were reduced to just a single tuning realised more or less exactly.<br/>&gt;</p><p>That is a difference of taste, and has nothing whatsoever regarding Brad&apos;s<br/>conviction that Bach has intended and specified a single well-temperament<br/>for at least a repertory of his music.</p><p>I agree that Bach sounds exotic in many other tunings. There are possibly an<br/>infinite number of temperaments in which Bach would sound &quot;acceptable&quot;, but<br/>it is quite a moot argument. While Brad may be looking for the &quot;best&quot; and<br/>&quot;true&quot;, I am searching for the &quot;historically plausible&quot;. Lehman&apos;s<br/>temperament seems to be &quot;historically plausible&quot; and earns merit.</p><p>&gt; Also, since choosing and realizing a good tuning is an important part<br/>&gt; of being a good instrumentalist, I think it would be a great<br/>&gt; inhibition of the creativity and mastery of keyboard players if they<br/>&gt; all followed the same recipe.<br/>&gt;</p><p>Agreed. But still, it is a matter of taste and preference.</p><p>&gt; Since Lehman (like several before him) appears on the side of a<br/>&gt; one-size-fits-all magic bullet approach to &apos;Bach tuning&apos;, wheres<br/>&gt; Lindley and Ortgies appear on the side of debunking the magic bullet<br/>&gt; and thereby reinstating a degree of individual artistic freedom and<br/>&gt; responsibility, my conclusion is obvious. &quot;There are nine and sixty<br/>&gt; ways of constructing tribal lays, And every single one of them is right!&quot;<br/>&gt;</p><p>So is Lehman&apos;s then. So why this attack by Lindley and Ortgies?</p><p>&gt; ~~~T~~~<br/>&gt;</p><p>Oz.</p></div><h3><a id=71909 href="#71909">ðŸ”—</a>Brad Lehman &#x3C;bpl@umich.edu&#x3E;</h3><span>6/16/2007 10:57:59 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>&gt; &gt; Where is Bach in all this?
