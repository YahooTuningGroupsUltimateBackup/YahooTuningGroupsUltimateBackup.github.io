It<br/>can be used for meantone scales or other kinds of scales with up to 24<br/>notes per octave. The fingering is the same in each octave, although only<br/>three of the black notes are available in all three octaves.</p><p>Place the naturals and five flats (12 notes per octave) on the white keys.<br/>Then use the black keys for sharps and double sharps. Here&apos;s what an<br/>&quot;ideal&quot; octave would look like, although on a real keyboard, 3-4 of the<br/>black keys are missing in each octave.</p><p>  C#  Cx  D#  Dx  E#  F#  Fx  G#  Gx  A#  Ax  B#<br/>C   Db  D   Eb  E   F   Gb  G   Ab  A   Bb  B    C</p><p>Note that C#, F#, and G# are available in all three octaves. B# is only<br/>available in the lower octave, Fx in the middle octave, and the others only<br/>in two of the three octaves. Of course, you can start the scale on any<br/>pitch and transpose the whole scale up or down if you need more sharps or<br/>more flats for a particular piece. You can also put different combinations<br/>of sharps and flats on the white keys, but this arrangement happens to work<br/>out well and is probably easier to remember.</p><p>I&apos;m sure someone must have thought of this before, since it seems so<br/>obvious in hindsight, but I don&apos;t remember seeing it.</p><p>I&apos;m also considering a similar layout for 15-note scales, but the obvious<br/>choice (putting Blackwood&apos;s decatonic scale on the white keys) leaves more<br/>gaps in the scale than necessary.</p><p>--<br/>see my music page ---&gt;   ---&lt;<a href="http://www.io.com/~hmiller/music/music.html">http://www.io.com/~hmiller/music/music.html</a>&gt;--<br/>    h i l r i . o         &quot;If all Printers were determin&apos;d not to print any<br/>     m l e @ o c m       thing till they were sure it would offend no body,<br/>   (Herman Miller)       there would be very little printed.&quot; -Ben Franklin</p></div><h3>graham@microtonal.co.uk</h3><span>6/1/2000 3:23:00 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Herman Miller wrote:</p><p>&gt; Here&apos;s a useful keyboard layout that uses a standard 61-note keyboard.<br/>&gt; It<br/>&gt; can be used for meantone scales or other kinds of scales with up to 24<br/>&gt; notes per octave.
