I also thought of well-temperaments and am experimenting with some of my own. (I&apos;d love to hear WTs used a lot more in popular music.)</p><p>I first came up with a quick-and-dirty tuning: a type of _temp&iuml;&iquest;&half;rament ordinaire_ which lowers all fifths between the perfect prime and augmented fifth/minor sixth by a quarter of a Pythagorean comma, then raises the remaining fifths by a quarter of a P-comma:</p><p>1/1<br/>72.63<br/>192.18<br/>276.54<br/>384.36<br/>492.18<br/>576.54<br/>696.09<br/>768.72<br/>888.27<br/>984.36<br/>1080.45<br/>2/1</p><p>This tuning is doable in 100-edo, with the two fifths being 58 and 59 steps.</p><p>The basic idea is to have just-flavored major intervals and septimal-like minors. I have 7/5 in mind for a tritone, not 11/8 or 18/13. This obviously works much better for keys with the fewest sharps and flats, but a retuned MIDI of Chopin&apos;s twenty-four Preludes doesn&apos;t sound that bad, just surreal at times.</p><p>I&apos;m searching the group archives right now for more information. My knowledge of well-temperaments is still rather limited; I wouldn&apos;t know how to improve a WT very much.</p><p>~D.</p></div><h3><a id=69998 href="#69998">ðŸ”—</a>Gene Ward Smith &#x3C;genewardsmith@coolgoose.com&#x3E;</h3><span>2/23/2007 12:46:18 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;Danny Wier&quot; &lt;dawiertx@...&gt; wrote:</p><p>&gt; I&apos;m searching the group archives right now for more information.
