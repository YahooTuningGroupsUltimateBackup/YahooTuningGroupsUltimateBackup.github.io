One extra digit behind the comma wouldn&apos;t hurt and<br/>having the numbers in straight order instead of cycle of<br/>fifths order would also be easier. I was looking for something<br/>like this:<br/> 0.0 94.168 198.171 298.078 393.680 498.045 597.590 699.492<br/> 796.123 895.757 1000.033 1095.635 1200.0<br/>Where 1/1 may be C or A, that&apos;s not really important.</p><p>Manuel</p></div>
