[...]</p><p>Yes, and I have also found L/s=3 (17-tone equal temperament or<br/>17-tET), L/s=4 (22-tET in a Pythagorean arrangement), and even L/s=5<br/>(27-tET for neo-Gothic with a metallophone-like timbre) to be fine.</p><p>In fact I consider 29-tET (L/s=2.5) to be on the very delectably<br/>&quot;gentle&quot; side of the neo-Gothic spectrum, and something around 46-tET<br/>(L/s=2.67) to be especially &quot;characteristic.&quot;</p><p>Thus high L/s ratios, like contrasts between pure or near-pure 3-limit<br/>concords and various types of complex unstable intervals at other<br/>points on the concord/discord spectrum, may be a feature of neo-Gothic<br/>music; and this melodic side of the question should receive due<br/>attention in my presentations. At times I have discussed compact<br/>diatonic semitones and large whole-tones, being much indebted to Mark<br/>Lindley (and also Easley Blackwood&apos;s diatonic &quot;R&quot;), but maybe this<br/>point should get more attention from a scale-generation perspective;<br/>it&apos;s the defining feature of Keenan Pepper&apos;s tuning, of course.</p><p>[Dave on Noble Mediants between interval ratios]</p><p>&gt; For example Noble_Mediant(4:5, 7:9) = (4+7phi):(5+9phi) gives a<br/>&gt; local maximum of dissonance but Noble_Mediant(4:5, 11:14) does<br/>&gt; not. Somewhat misleadingly, Noble_Mediant(7:9, 11:14) _does_ give a<br/>&gt; local dissonance maximum. But that is only because it is exactly the<br/>&gt; same number as Noble_Mediant(4:5, 7:9).</p><p>Other interesting cases producing identical Noble_Mediants are either<br/>(4:5, 7:9) or (4:5, 3:4); and either (7:11, 5:8) or (2:3, 5:8).</p><p>&gt; Margo, In your excellent articles on Keenan Pepper&apos;s neo-Gothic<br/>&gt; tuning you make use of noble mediants for both purposes (melodic and<br/>&gt; harmonic). I think the reader would benefit from a clear distinction<br/>&gt; between the two.</p><p>Yes, this may be a distinction difficult to overstate or overclarify.</p><p>&gt; Also, part 2 may give the reader the impression that I would<br/>&gt; consider the neo-Gothic near 17-tET to be somehow ideal because it<br/>&gt; maximises the complexity/dissonance of the pythagorean major<br/>&gt; third. I think your excellent spectrum chart could benefit from also<br/>&gt; showing the points that correspond to maximally complex minor thirds<br/>&gt; and major and minor sixths.  This would show that they cannot all be<br/>&gt; maximised together and would, I think, suggest a compromise<br/>&gt; somewhere around 29-tET.</p><p>Thank you for making a very fair and indeed very important point,<br/>while offering feedback not only clarifying your viewpoint but<br/>leading to an engaging question regarding a bit of an optimization<br/>dilemma.</p><p>Interestingly, if I take your ideal to be one of maximizing<br/>&quot;complexity/dissonance,&quot; then the best solution may depend on how much<br/>weight we choose to give the minor sixth, in contrast to the major and<br/>minor thirds and major sixth.</p><p>A table of Noble Mediants and regular fifth sizes for the three latter<br/>intervals, and then for the minor sixth, may make this problem<br/>clearer:</p><p>---------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>Interval  Valley Ratios              NobleMediant   Fifth   Tempering<br/>---------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>  M3      (4:5, 7:9) or (4:5, 3:4)     ~422.487   ~705.622    ~+3.667<br/>  m3      (5:6, 6:7)                   ~283.605   ~705.465    ~+3.510<br/>  M6      (3:5, 7:12)                  ~923.029   ~707.676    ~+5.721<br/>.....................................................................<br/>  m6      (5:8, 7:11) or (2:3, 5:8)    ~792.105   ~701.974    ~+0.019<br/>---------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p>Here the regular temperaments giving Noble Mediants of maximal<br/>complexity for major and minor thirds are quite close to 17-tET (fifth<br/>~705.882 cents, ~3.927 cents wide) with fifths just a bit smaller,<br/>while the major sixth would actually call for _more_ tempering in the<br/>wide direction, 39-tET (fifths ~707.692 cents) being almost precisely<br/>optimal under this criterion (major sixths at ~923.077 cents).</p><p>Thus for these three intervals, the mathematics would seem consistent<br/>with my musical intuition that a tuning in the neighborhood between<br/>around 29-tET and 46-tET, including Keenan Pepper&apos;s temperament, is<br/>&quot;milder&quot; than 17-tET.</p><p>However, if we consider the minor sixth and especially if we give it<br/>equal weight, this can throw our calculations askew: this interval is<br/>at almost precisely maximal complexity in Pythagorean tuning with pure<br/>3:2 fifths (~701.955 cents), where it has a size of 128:81 or ~792.180<br/>cents.</p><p>From an historical point of view, one might ask: &quot;Could this feature<br/>of Pythagorean tuning have influenced the 13th-century classification<br/>of the minor sixth as a &apos;perfect discord&apos; along with m2 and M7 and the<br/>tritonic intervals Aug4 or dim5?&quot;</p><p>In any event, whether or goal is to maximize complexity or to seek<br/>some other &quot;optimal&quot; level of complexity, for me maybe exemplified by<br/>the Classic Mediants for major and minor thirds (5+9):(7+4) or 14:11<br/>and (6+7):(5+6) or 13:11, the question of the minor sixth is an<br/>interesting musical dilemma.</p><p>My own inclination not to give this interval very much weight in such<br/>optimizations might have three possible musical rationales:</p><p>(1) In 13th-century music, where the minor sixth is indeed a very<br/>important cadential interval expanding to the octave, it is also<br/>viewed as a rather strong or even acute &quot;discord,&quot; while the<br/>relatively blending major and minor thirds and the relatively tense<br/>major sixth are regarded as more &quot;compatible.&quot; Maximizing the tension<br/>of an interval already considered quite &quot;discordant&quot; may be a less<br/>important priority.</p><p>(2) More generally, as I recall Paul Erlich has pointed out, a minor<br/>sixth even at a simple ratio such as 5:8 is not especially<br/>&quot;concordant,&quot; so fine-tuning its degree of tension in a style where it<br/>is an unstable interval may be less important. My crude explanation of<br/>this acoustical quality might focus on the tension between the third<br/>partial of the lower note and the second partial of the upper note,<br/>which is there whether our tuning is 128:81 or 7:11, etc.</p><p>(3) In 14th-century style, which emphasizes &quot;closest approach&quot;<br/>progressions by contrary motion where one voice moves by a whole-tone<br/>and the other by a diatonic semitone (e.g. m3-1, M3-5, M6-8), the<br/>minor sixth is less important as a cadential interval, since in this<br/>scheme it would resolve to the fourth, a less conclusive interval than<br/>unison, fifth, or octave.</p><p>However one decides to define the musical &quot;ideal,&quot; and to weigh these<br/>intervals, it is a notable observation that a tuning with the major<br/>third at or near 14:11 will have minor sixths at or close to a local<br/>_minimum_ of tension, 7:11. Note that I write 14:11 with terms in<br/>descending order to show that it is a complex integer ratio, but 7:11<br/>in ascending order to suggest that it may be simple and aurally<br/>recognizable by locking-in of partials.</p><p>Maybe this kind of minor sixth might be described as a bit &quot;languid&quot;<br/>in comparison with the Pythagorean flavor. In 13th-century style, in<br/>addition to m6-8 by contrary motion, it has an oblique resolution to<br/>the fifth by a descending semitone, around 80 cents in regular<br/>neo-Gothic tunings with a minor sixth of ~7:11, which can be very<br/>expressive.</p><p>To sum up on 17-tET as a nice tuning for &quot;maximal complexity&quot; -- apart<br/>from the question of the minor sixth -- here&apos;s a quick table:</p><p>---------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>Interval  Valley Ratios              NobleMediant   17-tET   Variance<br/>---------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>  M3      (4:5, 7:9) or (4:5, 3:4)     ~422.487   ~423.529    ~+1.042<br/>  m3      (5:6, 6:7)                   ~283.605   ~282.353    ~-1.252<br/>  M6      (3:5, 7:12)                  ~923.029   ~917.647    ~-5.382<br/>.....................................................................<br/>  m6      (5:8, 7:11) or (2:3, 5:8)    ~792.105   ~776.471   ~-15.635<br/>---------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p>Incidentally, if one seeks &quot;maximal complexity&quot; for all four<br/>intervals, then 17-tET might have another argument in its favor. If we<br/>consider 7:11 (~782.492 cents) as a rather &quot;shallow&quot; valley (a*b=77),<br/>then staying a few cents to _either_ side of it may be enough.  With<br/>17-tET, we&apos;re about 6.021 cents on the low side, in contrast to<br/>tunings with major thirds at or close to 14:11 where we&apos;re squarely in<br/>the 7:11 valley.</p><p>Most appreciatively,</p><p>Margo Schulter<br/><a href="mailto:mschulter@value.net">mschulter@value.net</a></p></div><h3><a id=14192 href="#14192">ðŸ”—</a>David C Keenan &#x3C;D.KEENAN@UQ.NET.AU&#x3E;</h3><span>10/9/2000 7:53:24 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Hi Margo,</p><p>Regarding the theoretical maximum-complexity tuning for neo-Gothic major<br/>and minor thirds and sixths.
