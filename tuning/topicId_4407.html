Kinda neat.</p><p>Anyway, one thing I&apos;ve been interested in for a<br/>long time is bamboo flutes. I&apos;ve made a couple<br/>in random tunings. I&apos;m still new at making them,<br/>but am learning about the physics involved and<br/>such.</p><p>Would anyone here be interested in bamboo flutes<br/>in various microtonal scales? Once I figure the<br/>measurements out, I should be able to make them<br/>in pretty much any scale from any tuning. Now,<br/>due to the fact that you only have 10 fingers<br/>to cover holes with, you have a max of about 12<br/>&quot;clean&quot; (not crossfingered) notes in the scale.<br/>For pricing, I was thinking about $40 or so each.<br/>Signed, numbered, with printed sheet showing<br/>tuning (tonic and deviations, hertz and cents).<br/>Carved artwork done by my wife for extra $.</p><p>Any interest? Could be a neat way to play with<br/>new tunings. I&apos;d probably start with 22TET, as<br/>that&apos;s my current interest. I may also make<br/>them out of PVC later, but I have plentiful<br/>bamboo from 1&quot; to 3&quot; in diameter (those big ones<br/>are COOL! I had one which had a tonic of F on<br/>the second line of the bass clef! It was 3&apos; long).</p><p>Darin &quot;Basil&quot; Arrick<br/><a href="mailto:basil_arrick@yahoo.com">basil_arrick@yahoo.com</a></p><p>Nonagon<br/><a href="http://www.geocities.com/SunsetStrip/Diner/2190">http://www.geocities.com/SunsetStrip/Diner/2190</a></p></div><h3><a id=4421 href="#4421">ðŸ”—</a>hmiller@xx.xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx)</h3><span>8/23/1999 8:55:01 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>On 23 Aug 1999 15:05:27 -0000, <a href="mailto:basil_arrick@yahoo.com">basil_arrick@yahoo.com</a> wrote:</p><p>&gt;Any interest?

So, while you can do<br/>interesting things with flute tunings, don&apos;t expect to have precise<br/>pitches coming out of your flute and you won&apos;t be disappointed.  :-)</p><p>Cheers,<br/>Christopher</p></div><h3><a id=4435 href="#4435">ðŸ”—</a>Paul H.
