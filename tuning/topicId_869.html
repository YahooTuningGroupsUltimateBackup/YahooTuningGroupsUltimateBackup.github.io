I suspect it is precisely *because* you don&apos;t<br/>have a conventional math background that you came up with it</p><p>I think that&#xFFFD;s fair&#xFFFD; As well as [not having a conventional math background]<br/>no excuse for erroneous data.</p><p>&gt;It comes out with many N&apos;s and D&apos;s that are too high for my liking, but I<br/>am curious to understand why it works at all, and what its limitations may<br/>be.</p><p>Perhaps for mine too&#xFFFD;  Though I&#xFFFD;ve yet to see a radically different<br/>conversion method will both A) UNIFORMLY addresses _every_ interval of<br/>_every_ (whole number) n-tET, _and_ B) CONSISTENTLY renders a closer<br/>approximation in smaller ratios.</p><p>&gt;What if we use 53-tET and get 31 * 22 / 53. This clearly doesn&apos;t work.</p><p> 0<br/>----  =  155/155.<br/>53</p><p>1/1, 78/77, 157/153, 79/76, 159/151, 16/15, 161/149, 81/74, 163/147, 82/73,<br/>33/29, 83/72, 167/143, 84/71, 169/141, 17/14, 171/139, 86/69, 173/137,<br/>87/68, 35/27, 88/67, 177/133, 89/66, 179/131, 18/13, 181/129[i]&#xFFFD;2/1</p><p>&gt;How high does d have to go before this diverges from the original formula?</p><p>To be truthful I just (re)discovered this method this weekend (along with<br/>about four or five other convoluted variations), and have not yet done any<br/>of the tedious checks and double checks -- but I am pretty confident that<br/>while the &apos;terraced overtones&apos; will of course keep on increasing, and hence<br/>become more and more &#xFFFD;unsightly&#xFFFD;&#xFFFD; the net results should remain<br/>appropriately analogous to the lower numbered divisions.</p><p>Dan</p></div>
