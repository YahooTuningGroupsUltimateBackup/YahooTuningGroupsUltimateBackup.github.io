The low sixtht string is taken off, to have the root G as lowest<br/>string. This allows a mixture of chordal and melodic playing, which<br/>appearently is the case in 19th Nervous Breakdown.</p><p>BTW: open tunings are not completely irrelevant for the Tuning List. There<br/>are many examples of open tunings allowing a microtonal composition for<br/>12tet fretted guitar.</p><p>--Wim Hoogewerf</p></div>
