Twining apparently didn&apos;t<br/>like the results he got until he used headphones, which seems a little<br/>dubious. Another approach, if we wanted a recorded performance, is to<br/>do what Aaron Wolf has done with his barbershop quartet and Melodyne.<br/>That certainly seems to solve the intonation question very nicely, but<br/>it is limited in that it won&apos;t work for live performances, and may not<br/>be acceptable to musicians.</p><p>I&apos;m wondering if I could get some feedback on the question of<br/>soundfiles as an alternative to printed scores.

It&apos;s usually thought of as<br/>10:12:14:17, so baritones (or leads if they are the second to<br/>lowest note) are told to sing out louder and extra strong<br/>on diminished chords to help the other parts tune.

Many barbershoppers teach that the melody<br/>should be sung as melodically clean as possible and that<br/>every other part, including bass, should tune to every whim<br/>of the lead melody.  I think this actually happens very rarely.<br/>The idea that there could be this range of who actually<br/>tunes to other parts means that some quartets don&apos;t listen<br/>and blend well, and are considered poor.  But the overall<br/>question remains.  Does the bass ever adjust to anyone, or<br/>just insist that he&apos;s right because he&apos;s the bass?  Same<br/>question for the lead.  And if they sang JI like my example,<br/>then they could all learn the JI tuning of their parts, and<br/>virtually ignore each other and still tune ok.  Realistically,<br/>I think every baritone tunes to the other parts, and every<br/>tenor too (but maybe not AS much so), and it is the<br/>battle between leads and basses as to who gets to be<br/>dominant and focus the tuning.  Some people can get dogmatic<br/>about this issue.  Some people decry how terrible barbershop<br/>basses are at being solid and consistent.  Some people<br/>think they should be, as they are to harmonize to the lead.<br/>None of this is necessarily &quot;right.&quot;  These are all people<br/>who were taught what they were taught and very few people<br/>who talk about this stuff are the woodshedders who<br/>originated the style.

You may not have heard that the<br/>baritone, Rob Henry, the brother of the Bass,  Jim Henry, died<br/>of cancer in 2003. I was there when the quartet retired in 2004,<br/>at what was almost certainly the most emotional performance I<br/>have witnessed in my entire life.  After singing with a rotating<br/>bunch of baritones who had filled in over the previous year. they<br/>had a live video recording of the tune the baritone did a solo on,<br/>ironically: Still Can&apos;t Say Goodbye, an incredibly beautiful<br/>non-barbershop song about missing one&apos;s dad who<br/>passed on.  Rob was up on the video screen singing the solo,<br/>while the other three were on stage, live singing the loo loo parts.<br/>They interspersed the performance video with scrapbook clips and<br/>photos of his life and family and kids.  I truly mean it when I say<br/>there was not a dry eye in the 10,000 person audience.  It still<br/>stands in my mind as the most moving performance I can even<br/>imagine.  The trio barely got through the song, but they did.</p><p>Anyway, that aside, the reason barbershopper&apos;s won&apos;t be found<br/>to be up for new microtonal compositions is simply because<br/>barbershop itself is so challenging and rewarding that it is only<br/>the very rare group that becomes good enough, at a young enough<br/>age to even consider trying difficult new compositions.<br/>You simply won&apos;t find a chorus anywhere that has the time<br/>and skill to do that.  There may be some quartets, but by that<br/>level you aren&apos;t dealing with &quot;barbershoppers&quot; so much as<br/>a specific group of 4 singers.  That said, I think a top notch<br/>barbershop quartet will be certainly more successful at new<br/>microtonal compositions than a classical or pop a cappella group.<br/>But I think that professional, serious early music ensembles<br/>that use little or no vibrato are probably just as good candidates.</p><p>If somehow my recordings as learning tools can increase pitch<br/>sensitivity within the society as a whole, well who knows?<br/>Certainly it is hard to predict where barbershop will be in<br/>20 years when the generation of the largest era in the preservationist<br/>society have passed on.  Generally the younger groups today are<br/>fantastic and are taking things in a modern direction as far as<br/>less hokiness and as far as higher standards go.  I&apos;m optimistic<br/>in some ways.</p><p>-Aaron</p></div><h3>Herman Miller &#x3C;hmiller@IO.COM&#x3E;</h3><span>3/3/2006 6:24:06 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Gene Ward Smith wrote:<br/>&gt; Listening to barbershop, which deviates pretty far from the<br/>&gt; theoretical 12-et, makes me wonder how much we really need notation,<br/>&gt; given that instead of a score it would be easier, and perhaps more<br/>&gt; useful, to produce a part soundfile instead. Twining apparently didn&apos;t<br/>&gt; like the results he got until he used headphones, which seems a little<br/>&gt; dubious. Another approach, if we wanted a recorded performance, is to<br/>&gt; do what Aaron Wolf has done with his barbershop quartet and Melodyne.<br/>&gt; That certainly seems to solve the intonation question very nicely, but<br/>&gt; it is limited in that it won&apos;t work for live performances, and may not<br/>&gt; be acceptable to musicians.<br/>&gt; &gt; I&apos;m wondering if I could get some feedback on the question of<br/>&gt; soundfiles as an alternative to printed scores. What do the microtonal<br/>&gt; musicians here think about this? I think if it was acceptable it would<br/>&gt; make getting a microtonal piece ready for performance far easier.</p><p>According to the liner notes on Easley Blackwood&apos;s CD &quot;Microtonal&quot;, Jeffrey Kust &quot;found very helpful an electronic simulation of the piece in true tempo, half tempo, and quarter tempo&quot;. So this sort of approach of using recordings has certainly been useful before. I imagine recordings would also be helpful with rhythm, tempo, and dynamics, especially with anything out of the ordinary (think of golden ratio rhythms and such). But there are other cases where notation can be useful.</p><p>For one thing, notation can help in the composing process. To some extent, the notation used by composers has different (potentially conflicting) goals from the notation used by performers. The piano roll window in a MIDI editor could be considered a minimal form of notation, especially if you&apos;re working with an ET (having different step sizes complicates the use of piano rolls, which don&apos;t have many useful landmarks). But if you can use conventional notation, you can jot down a half dozen ideas on the same sheet of paper and plan how to organize them more easily. To some extent, my interest in microtonal notation is influenced by the fact that I used to rely on notation when composing in 12-ET, and I miss having the ability to do this.</p><p>It&apos;s been a very long time since I&apos;ve done any performing in a group, but I can imagine how hard it would be to coordinate more than a handful of performers if you don&apos;t have a written score to refer to at least in the initial stages. Complex music can certainly be memorized, but referring to notation is useful in the early stages of memorization.</p><p>Notation is also good for looking at what other composers have done and learning from their experiences. I can learn more about composing in ET&apos;s from reading Easley Blackwood&apos;s scores along with the CD than just by listening to the CD alone.</p></div><h3>Carl Lumma &#x3C;clumma@yahoo.com&#x3E;</h3><span>3/4/2006 12:46:58 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>&gt; How much math could be involved?</p><p>For my part, I was trying a little to be funny, and<br/>trying a little to say that I generally respect<br/>mathematicians.</p><p>&gt; Renaissance polyphony is 5-limit with extensive use of passing<br/>&gt; notes.

Besides being a non-classical<br/>all male singing style, I can&apos;t think of almost anything else particularly in<br/>common.  Harmonically doowop is incredibly simple and basic compared<br/>to barbershop.  Doowop usually has simple diatonic triads that repeat<br/>for the whole song.  Barbershop is complex, crazy, high-limit chordal<br/>structures with complex shifts and arrangements.  In this case it is so<br/>different that any non-musician can easily identify the difference because<br/>they sound so discreetly different.</p><p>As far as Mills Brothers, I don&apos;t know what to say exactly.  It may not be<br/>strict barbershop, but they are much closer to barbershop tradition,<br/>and have a lot in common with barbershop.</p><p>Essentially, barbershop needs a melody range that is comfortable<br/>for an average, not virtuoso, singer.  And this melody needs to<br/>IMPLY a fifths-based &quot;circle of fifths&quot; harmonic progression.  And<br/>add to that the other stuff I listed, like harmony above melody...<br/>But the main point is the barbershop HARMONY is specific.  7th<br/>chords that resolve around 5ths roots back to home.  If it is a<br/>I-IV-V song, and that&apos;s all, or in the case of doowop, I-vi-IV-V,<br/>then it *certainly* is not much like barbershop.</p><p>-Aaron</p></div><h3>klaus schmirler &#x3C;KSchmir@online.de&#x3E;</h3><span>3/4/2006 8:18:03 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Aaron Wolf wrote:</p><p>&gt; Oh, doowop may be sung for fun by a barbershop quartet occassionally,<br/>&gt; but they have VERY LITTLE in common as far as style.

Besides being a non-classical<br/>&gt; all male singing style, I can&apos;t think of almost anything else particularly in<br/>&gt; common.  Harmonically doowop is incredibly simple and basic compared<br/>&gt; to barbershop.  Doowop usually has simple diatonic triads that repeat<br/>&gt; for the whole song.  Barbershop is complex, crazy, high-limit chordal<br/>&gt; structures with complex shifts and arrangements.  In this case it is so<br/>&gt; different that any non-musician can easily identify the difference because<br/>&gt; they sound so discreetly different.</p><p>I see. Apparently, not everything I had thought of as doo-wop is. Really, the tenor lead alone (in the olden terminology when the upper voices were called altus and cantus or motetus and triplum and tenor _meant_ lead) is an obvious distinction I should have thought of myself.</p><p>Thanks,</p><p>klaus</p></div><h3>Joseph Pehrson &#x3C;jpehrson@rcn.com&#x3E;</h3><span>3/4/2006 1:53:04 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;Gene Ward Smith&quot; &lt;genewardsmith@...&gt;<br/>wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Listening to barbershop, which deviates pretty far from the<br/>&gt; theoretical 12-et, makes me wonder how much we really need notation,<br/>&gt; given that instead of a score it would be easier, and perhaps more<br/>&gt; useful, to produce a part soundfile instead. Twining apparently didn&apos;t<br/>&gt; like the results he got until he used headphones, which seems a little<br/>&gt; dubious. Another approach, if we wanted a recorded performance, is to<br/>&gt; do what Aaron Wolf has done with his barbershop quartet and Melodyne.<br/>&gt; That certainly seems to solve the intonation question very nicely, but<br/>&gt; it is limited in that it won&apos;t work for live performances, and may not<br/>&gt; be acceptable to musicians.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I&apos;m wondering if I could get some feedback on the question of<br/>&gt; soundfiles as an alternative to printed scores. What do the microtonal<br/>&gt; musicians here think about this? I think if it was acceptable it would<br/>&gt; make getting a microtonal piece ready for performance far easier.<br/>&gt;</p><p>***Well, to me, anyway, it seema a little &quot;musically illiterate...&quot;<br/>Most musicians like to look at the line they are going to be performing<br/>to see their place in the scheme of things, or at least where they are<br/>in their part.  I agree that a soundfile is a powerful adjunct to this<br/>score, but seems to take us back perhaps a bit to the oral tradition<br/>before the printed word, or the ages of arithmetic, base 10, where we<br/>needed to count on our fingers and toes... :)</p><p>Herman Miller&apos;s comments were interesting with reference to Easley<br/>Blackwood.  I admit I don&apos;t frequently notate electronics; I basically<br/>notate what is necessary so that a musician can execute a part and<br/>produce music.  So, the electronic parts are notated frequently<br/>as &quot;cues...&quot; However, from a *theoretical* point of view, if one wishes<br/>to study a score, it could be an enhancement to have all the pitches<br/>there, notated somehow.  I&apos;m usually on to the next piece by the time<br/>it would take me to do all of that...</p><p>J.
