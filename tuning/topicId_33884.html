The notation is an<br/>approximation, and the ear fills in the rest.</p><p>I don&apos;t know whether it works:   sometimes their harmonies all sound the<br/>same.   a kind of anonymity to the sound.</p><p>&gt; Most other methods quickly degenerate into<br/>&gt;conceptual juggling<br/>&gt;of unperceptable entities (rows being but one example). Things that look<br/>&gt;good<br/>&gt;on paper.</p><p>What I like about these ways of working is the &quot;fallout&quot;---cool chords,<br/>gestures, event-complexes or whatever (cool meaning cool-sounding.)  I<br/>think you can get things to happen this way that you&apos;d never think of if<br/>you went the &quot;all-natural&quot; route.</p><p>Of course, a good composer has to skew things so that the &quot;fallout&quot; really<br/>is cool most of the time, and not &quot;grey&quot;, as happened so often with serial<br/>music.</p><p>Boulez&apos;s Pli Selon Pli, or ferneyhough&apos;s La Chute D&apos;Icare  are good<br/>examples.   Boulez 3rd Sonata, last movment, is the reverse---bla-ness.</p></div><h3><a id=33896 href="#33896">ðŸ”—</a>Kraig Grady &#x3C;kraiggrady@anaphoria.com&#x3E;</h3><span>2/9/2002 10:48:35 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>hi Christopher!</p><p>Christopher Bailey wrote:</p><p>&gt; What I like about these ways of working is the &quot;fallout&quot;---cool chords,<br/>&gt; gestures, event-complexes or whatever (cool meaning cool-sounding.)

There is much to be said about a blind person attempting to gain sight by<br/>becoming blind drunk. seriously. no offense meant as i acknowledge that we are all blind in large<br/>measure .
