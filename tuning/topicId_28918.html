The topic of pitch and color is kind of<br/>an obsession for me.  I have my own ideas about it which I apply to writing<br/>music in pure intonation, and I&apos;ve invented an electronic wind instrument<br/>based on these ideas.  As I&apos;ve been working on a book about it for a while<br/>now, I can give you a partial bibliography of interesting sources.  Pitch -<br/>color associations are mostly idiosyncratic and arbitrary.  Of course, many<br/>well known composers have had personal synesthetic experiences; Prokofiev,<br/>Skriabin, etc.  Many color theorists and artists have stated their ideas on<br/>this (e.g. Goethe).  There are several ways to make a pseudo-scientific<br/>correlation, resulting in C = green or C = red and other relations (see Lucy<br/>Tuning on the web for one take on this).  Contrary to somewhat popular lore<br/>(see Barbara Hero&apos;s lambdoma webpages), Pythagorean sources contain zero<br/>references to color and music.  Aristotle said something to the effect that<br/>there is a color code in everything, but that&apos;s about the extent of Greek<br/>color-music theory before Xenakis.  A whole slew of metaphysical (and<br/>religious) lore surrounds this topic, making it often seem like<br/>pseudoscientific bunk to academics, and honestly you need to do a lot of<br/>sifting to find sources which are interesting.  Out of about 40 books on the<br/>topic which I got on interlibrary loan from all over the country, maybe 10<br/>had anything I felt was really worthwhile in them.  Countless people have<br/>&quot;discovered&quot; a &quot;new&quot; way to write music with colors which amounts to<br/>redundant coding for 12 equal tempered pitches.  The majority of published<br/>&quot;discoveries&quot; have absolutely nothing to do with tuning.  There are also many<br/>U.S. Patents on color-pitch associations, mostly for teaching purposes.<br/>Obviously it&apos;s been a topic of interest for generations.  Here are some<br/>sources you might find interesting.   They&apos;re in no particular order, and<br/>some are just color theory books or color/pitch percption or psychophysics<br/>texts.</p><p>best,<br/>Aaron<br/>--------</p><p>OPTICKS, or A Treatise of the Reflections, Refractions, Inflections and<br/>Colors of Light, by Sir Isaac Newton, fourth edition 1730, available from<br/>Dover Publications, New York, 1952<br/>(established ROYGBIV and an analogy between the diatonic scale and the<br/>rainbow, the most pervasive idea associated with the topic, later dismissed<br/>by Helmholtz and others)</p><p>Coloured Light: An Art Medium, being the third edition enlarged of<br/>&ldquo;Colour-Music,&rdquo; by Adrian Bernard Klen, M.B.E., A.R.P.S., Technical Press<br/>Ltd., 1937.<br/>(possibly the best introduction to and synopsis of the subject, summarizes a<br/>large number of other sources)</p><p>The Elements of Color, A treatise on the color system of Johannes Itten based<br/>on his book &ldquo;The Art of Color&rdquo;, by Johannes Itten, translated by Ernst van<br/>Hagen, edited by Faber Birren, published by John Wiley and Sons, Inc., 1970.<br/>(refers to Newton, equates color with pitch, Itten&rsquo;s RYB credo at bauhaus,<br/>1919, also influenced Klee, Kandinsky and others)</p><p>Colour-Music, the art of Mobile Color, by Wallace Rimington, Hutchinson and<br/>Co., 1912.<br/>(the color organ)</p><p>Musicolour, by Ronald Senator, Musicolor Ltd., 1977.<br/>(12 tone colors)</p><p>Farb-Musik: Leitfaden f&uuml;r eine kombinierte Farben- und Musiklehre, by Fritz<br/>Dobretzberger and Johannes Paul, 1993, Simon and Leutner Verlag, Berlin.<br/>12 tone, 12 colors, (figures), also planets</p><p>Der Akkord- und Quintenzirkel in Farben und T&ouml;nen, Ein einfaches Gesetz der<br/>Farbenharmonie, von Hans Bartolo Brand, J.
