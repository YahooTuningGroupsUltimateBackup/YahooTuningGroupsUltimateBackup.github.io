One cannot tell simply by<br/>looking at the divisions. For this reason I see nothing wrong with<br/>continuing with the traditional (certainly not &quot;bizarre&quot; as one<br/>correspondent characterized it) definition of a tempered interval as one<br/>defined by an irrational ratio.</p><p>While I&apos;m at it, some people have made the claim that, to the &quot;person on<br/>the street,&quot; microtonality means any music different from 12TET. I must<br/>say, this is not my experience. When teaching students who only vaguely<br/>know of any alternatives to 12TET, I have found that they nearly invariably<br/>assume that &quot;microtonality&quot; refers to very small intervals, i.e. smaller<br/>than a semitone. It makes sense: &quot;micro&quot; in every other word they&apos;re<br/>familiar with means &quot;very small,&quot; so why not here? It would be like trying<br/>to convince them that &quot;micromanage&quot; should refer to any unusual management<br/>style.</p><p>When I introduce other tuning systems like meantone or JI without very<br/>small intervals, they really don&apos;t know what to call it, other than &quot;other<br/>tunings.&quot; When one of my students refers to Arabian or Iranian music as<br/>&quot;microtonal,&quot; on questioning, it is because of microtonal pitch inflections<br/>and ornamentation, not the neutral third. With all respect to the<br/>interesting title of Johnny&apos;s radio show, it would NEVER occur to them, or<br/>to my colleagues in the music department, to call Bach &quot;microtonal,&quot; even<br/>if they knew he was not using 12TET. I see no reason to try to convince<br/>them otherwise.</p><p>I&apos;m also uncomfortable with &quot;xenharmonic&quot; because it highlights the<br/>&quot;strangeness&quot; of the difference, which may have been something Darreg,<br/>McLaren, and others prize, but to me is not necessarily a musical priority.<br/>I&apos;m surprised no one has mentioned Ken Wauchope&apos;s &quot;allotonal,&quot; which to me<br/>is much better, though still requires explanation to those the<br/>non-cognoscenti. I will probably go on using &quot;other tuning systems&quot; or<br/>&quot;alternate tunings,&quot; and the whole EDO, UDI, NDO, FBI, CIA, MOUSE has left<br/>me in confusion.</p><p>Bill</p><p>^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^<br/>^ Bill Alves                                      email: <a href="mailto:alves@hmc.edu">alves@hmc.edu</a> ^<br/>^ Harvey Mudd College                 URL: <a href="http://www2.hmc.edu/~alves/">http://www2.hmc.edu/~alves/</a> ^<br/>^ 301 E.

And while I often use JI comparative means to look at and<br/>describe tunings like 20e (and whatnot), I&apos;m also convinced that equal<br/>divisions can be seen as having a recognizable (i.e., distinguishable<br/>from simple ratios) sound all their own, and that that sound is<br/>sometimes not best see in JI comparative terms...

But then again the<br/>basic premise of an expanded and musically contextual intonation --<br/>where more &quot;out of tune&quot; might or might not be just as good or useful<br/>as more &quot;in tune&quot; -- was what led me stumbling into microtonality in<br/>the first place; &quot;into&quot; microtonality and not necessarily &quot;out of&quot;<br/>12e... in other words I intuitively knew that I wanted more &apos;colors,&apos;<br/>but this was not necessarily impelled by a &apos;psychoacoustic&apos; or aural<br/>dissatisfaction with those of 12e. But I know for others, it was<br/>indeed more of fundamental desire (or need) to sing or play or be &quot;in<br/>tune&quot; that led them away from twelve tone equal temperament... It&apos;s<br/>always seemed interesting to me to contemplate how much these things<br/>effect the ways we go about describing and (even more so) using what<br/>we hear.</p><p>Dan</p></div><h3><a id=7532 href="#7532">ðŸ”—</a>Paul H.

My concept is no less intuitive to me than<br/>yours is to you.</p><p>Firstly, your preference for the 12TET model as the basis for theoretical<br/>discussion is at odds with my inability to find a single model for<br/>measurement.  Even the overtone series is but a single possibility.<br/>Determined to have a meaning that is cross-cultural requires a different<br/>approach.  I do use 1200TET as a tool for measuring, but not as a theoretical<br/>essence for tuning.</p><p>Secondly, I am challenging the perception that you have that Carrillo coined<br/>the terms in question.  Carrillo&apos;s &quot;thirteenth sound&quot; is a violinist&apos;s<br/>left-hand index finger on the nut of the violin&apos;s G-string, producing a pitch<br/>a 16th tone higher than the open G.  This new pitch for violinist Carrillo<br/>opened the flood gates of his 96TET ideal.  I am appealing to all on this<br/>list to find any evidence at all connecting Carrillo with &quot;micro&quot; prefixed<br/>terms.  While is incremental approach to composition might seem to amplify a<br/>&quot;tiny&quot; tone affection, students listening to this are no more opened up to<br/>the storehouse of new intervals with profound affects.</p><p>Previously, I spoke of an evolution for the term &quot;microtonal,&quot; and some have<br/>dismissed it fairly out of hand.  Though I had also though, and published,<br/>that Carrillo coined these terms, I am admitting I think I was wrong.  I hope<br/>the list can assist in tracing the true etymology of the term.  I believe<br/>Ezra Sims recanted on his early Harvard article as well (through faintly<br/>remembered early conversations we held).</p><p>In an attempt to explain my concept of the evolving term, I offer the<br/>following chart.</p><p>1.  The term microtone is a new, foreign pitch, small in size, placed between<br/>the diesis of a culturally-accepted system of tuning.  It originates from the<br/>early meaning of &quot;enharmonic&quot; before its meaning was reduced to an identity.</p><p>2.  Once the accurate measurement can be made of the tiniest of intervals, by<br/>extension, each diesis of a culturally-accepted system of tuning, can have<br/>its microtones.  When measuring between any designated microtone and any<br/>other conventional tone, a microtonal interval is established.  The meaning<br/>has now evolved to include all musical tones that are not part of convention.</p><p>3.  When a cultural model is used for measurement, than it is not possible to<br/>communicate with musicians using different tone relationships.  A traveling<br/>musician soon realizes that there are different musical realities in<br/>different cultures.  In order to communicate on a theoretical level, cognates<br/>are welcome.  Even in France, the term &quot;just intonation&quot; is a false congnate.<br/> &quot;L&apos;intonation juste&quot; means accurate 12TET.</p><p>4.  As perhaps anticipated by Varese, there is a continuum of sound and<br/>points can be set anywhere on the line of pitch frequency.  There is no need<br/>for moralizing about which are the &quot;real&quot; ones or the &quot;legitimate&quot; ones.  All<br/>musical tone relationships have legitimacy, especially in light of the fact<br/>that absolute pitch is an illusion.  Pitch standardizing, diverse throughout<br/>the world, means no single pitch has any specific name, except in its<br/>relationship to a standard.</p><p>Johnny Reinhard<br/>AFMM</p></div><h3><a id=7585 href="#7585">ðŸ”—</a>alves@xxxxx.xx.xxx.xxxxxxxxxxxxxxx)</h3><span>1/6/2000 11:29:07 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>&gt;Bill, it appears we have a different conceptual basis for the material we&apos;ve<br/>&gt;been talking about on the list.

Nevertheless, whenever<br/>possible, I speak of the ideal of treating musical systems of all cultures<br/>on equal footing, just as it should be with pitch systems. So, while I do<br/>use &quot;alternate tuning&quot; when I need to express to my students or to those<br/>who hear my work that this music differs from the standard they are used<br/>to, I do look forward to the utopia in which such distinctions are<br/>unnecessary.</p><p>However, I am curious about your own use of &quot;microtonality.&quot; It seems that<br/>you were using the reviewers you quoted to back up your own definition, and<br/>yet they were making the same &quot;preference for the 12TET model&quot; that you<br/>deplore:</p><p>&quot;&apos;Microtonal music&apos; means any kind of music that<br/>ventures beyond the fixed 12 notes of the conventional chromatic scale.&quot;</p><p>&quot;The term microtone simply refers to the notes<br/>that exist between the 12 pitches that somewhat arbitrarily divide  the<br/>standard octave.&quot;</p><p>(Actually the quote of Kozinn seems to back up the definition I prefer.)</p><p>These definitions seem to be that &quot;microtonality&quot; refers to anything other<br/>than 12TET, which is the same thing as my &quot;alternate tunings,&quot; reference to<br/>the 12TET model and all. At other times, I seem to recall that you have<br/>included 12TET in &quot;microtonality,&quot; which, to repeat Dan Wolf, means that<br/>the term loses all meaning. So, which is it? Does your definition of<br/>&quot;microtonality&quot; exclude 12TET (in which case, the above quotes don&apos;t really<br/>support your definition and you are also using 12TET as a model) or does it<br/>include 12TET (in which case one might as well call it the &quot;American<br/>Festival of Pitched Music&quot;)?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;Secondly, I am challenging the perception that you have that Carrillo coined<br/>&gt;the terms in question.</p><p>I never expressed a perception that Carillo coined the terms in question. I<br/>merely said that our use of the term has historically come via Carillo and<br/>others, meaning that most of the alternate tuning experiments in the first<br/>half or so of the twentieth century have involved intervals smaller than a<br/>semitone, and &quot;microtonality&quot; was coined (by whom I don&apos;t know) to describe<br/>this trend.</p><p>By the way, a &quot;microphone&quot; does not make a &quot;small&quot; sound louder. That&apos;s the<br/>job of the amplifier. A microphone responds to &quot;tiny sounds&quot; and transduces<br/>them.</p><p>Lastly, I don&apos;t wish to denigrate or make light of other&apos;s well-thought<br/>uses of terms and inventions of new ones, and I apologize if I&apos;ve given<br/>that impression. Johnny is free, as is anyone on the list, to use terms in<br/>ways they think are best for communicating their ideas. My responses are<br/>merely my defense of my own preferences -- as well as defenses to the<br/>impressions that I haven&apos;t taught my students well, that I prefer to take<br/>12TET as a single model, and that I think that Carillo invented the term<br/>&quot;microtonality.&quot; While I cannot here further defend the quality of my<br/>teaching, I hope I have cleared up the rest.</p><p>Bill</p><p>^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^<br/>^ Bill Alves                                      email: <a href="mailto:alves@hmc.edu">alves@hmc.edu</a> ^<br/>^ Harvey Mudd College                 URL: <a href="http://www2.hmc.edu/~alves/">http://www2.hmc.edu/~alves/</a> ^<br/>^ 301 E.

Instead, I truly believe, such dispersions<br/>are part of a grand dynamic temperament with its own stochastic patterns<br/>and &apos;laws&apos;.</p><p>Happy new year!!!<br/>Dr. Can Akkoc<br/>Alabama School of Mathematics and Science<br/>1255 Dauphin Street<br/>Mobile, AL 36604<br/>USA</p><p>Phone:  (334) 441-2126<br/>  Fax:  (334) 441-3290<br/>  Web:  <a href="http://199.20.31.100/GIFT/">http://199.20.31.100/GIFT/</a></p></div><h3><a id=7589 href="#7589">ðŸ”—</a>Afmmjr@xxx.xxx</h3><span>1/6/2000 12:28:33 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Bill, sorry to make you feel so defensive when I speak straight from the hip<br/>about the term microtonality.  My intention in printing the quotes was to<br/>demonstrate that at least in this part of the world, the limited definition<br/>of &quot;microtone&quot; relegated only to an interval smaller than a semitone has been<br/>superseded in the northeast USA.</p><p>The journalists themselves are not microtonalists, nor are they even<br/>musicians (as it&apos;s part of their job description).  They are reiterating what<br/>I have said, that the power of microtonal music comes as much or more from<br/>the larger intervals that are distinctive, than it does from the tiny<br/>ant-like relationships.</p><p>These quotes reflect a cultural definition of microtonal music, though<br/>clearly my culture is the New York megalopolis.  I am a native New Yorker,<br/>not too common actually among musicians practicing here (as a matter of fact).</p><p>Now, as a practicing microtonalist (performer, composer, producer, writer,<br/>educator, et al.) I have an insight other than a newspaper critic.  I can<br/>conceive of a tolerance for all the different approaches, much as you have.<br/>Ethnomusicology started as &quot;Comparative Musicology&quot; in Germany.  It soon was<br/>recognized as no more than &quot;them compared to us,&quot; and was then idealized<br/>further into Ethnomusicology.  It still certainly falls short as a term, but<br/>that is a discussion in itself.</p><p>In striving to achieve a cross-cultural perspective, I idealize that _all<br/>music_ is microtonal.  It is achieved through the simple process of<br/>extension, used everywhere on this list.  Just as any note from any note is<br/>sensible, so all are sensible, comparable only to a scripted model.  It could<br/>be any model and need not require reference.</p><p>The term does not lose meaning when the musics connected by the term receive<br/>concerts, previously unavailable or exceedingly rare.</p><p>Johnny Reinhard<br/>AFMM</p></div>
