Just as a map doesn&apos;t attempt to predict whether a<br/>given traveller might prefer valleys or plateaux, but simply indicates<br/>where different elevations might be found, so I would take harmonic<br/>entropy as a model which people can use to describe their own tastes.</p><p>For example, in a harmonic timbre suggested to me by a soundcrafter of<br/>recognized expertise, I find that 12:14:18:21 (0-267-702-969 cents) or<br/>14:18:21:24 (0-435-702-933 cents) is rather &quot;smooth,&quot; while 11:14<br/>(~417.51 cents) in a sonority close to 22:28:33 (0-418-702 cents --<br/>actually about 0-418-704 cents) has an effect at once pleasantly<br/>&quot;active&quot; and somehow also &quot;smooth&quot; or &quot;resonant&quot; in a certain way.</p><p>These are musical impressions: harmonic entropy theories I&apos;ve heard<br/>often tend to take the first kind of sonority as presenting simple<br/>intervals or &quot;valleys,&quot; with 11:14 regarded as more of a point on a<br/>&quot;plateau&quot; or more complex area rather than a distinct &quot;valley&quot; or<br/>minimum in itself.</p><p>In this timbre, a bit like a reed organ (to which I&apos;ve added some<br/>plucked string sounds, maybe a bit harpsichord-like or harp-like), the<br/>tempered 22:28:33 has a feeling at once &quot;exciting&quot; and &quot;rather sweet,&quot;<br/>the kind of quality I like for a place to pause in a 14th-century<br/>style.</p><p>This is also the kind of effect I get in some nice timbres with a<br/>usual Pythagorean 64:81 (about 408 cents), the &quot;historically<br/>authentic&quot; choice.</p><p>Maybe I should explain my own view of &quot;harmonic entropy&quot; from a<br/>certain musical outlook: it&apos;s simply a kind of map of how simple or<br/>complex intervals might be expected to sound in various regions of the<br/>spectrum. Whether something is pleasing or otherwise depends on the<br/>style, and on the listener.</p><p>One prediction of harmonic entropy theory that does seem more or less<br/>to fit my experience is that a &quot;large major third&quot; type of interval<br/>may be at maximum complexity -- which can translate into &quot;dissonance&quot;<br/>in some harmonic textures -- at around 423 cents. This is right around<br/>17-tET, where a regular major third has a size of 6/17 octave or<br/>423.53 cents.</p><p>I&apos;ve noticed that these 17-tET major thirds may call for a bit of<br/>sensitivity to timbre, so that they sound _relatively_ blending in a<br/>neo-medieval kind of style where they should be unstable and at the<br/>same time _somewhat_ &quot;concordant.&quot; A bit of adjustment can make them<br/>very pleasing indeed: rich and complex, and yet &quot;compatible.&quot; This may<br/>mean simply picking a more &quot;pastelized&quot; kind of texture, with gentler<br/>definition of &quot;peaks&quot; and &quot;valleys.&quot;</p><p>Anyway, Paul, I enjoy your gift both as a piece of visual art and as a<br/>map encouraging musical exploration -- one theme of this forum.</p><p>With peace, love, and best holiday wishes,</p><p>Margo</p></div><h3><a id=31875 href="#31875">ðŸ”—</a>paulerlich &#x3C;paul@stretch-music.com&#x3E;</h3><span>12/24/2001 1:24:04 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In tuning@y..., &quot;M.

The new<br/>version, of course, makes everything quite explicit -- a wonderful<br/>gift indeed in both versions.</p><p>Looking at the first version, I could see a couple of small &quot;valleys&quot;<br/>between 4:5 and 7:9, but on the basis of the diagram alone, I would be<br/>cautious about placing those at any specific point in the spectrum.<br/>Once I know that one of them is at 11:14, I have no problem at all<br/>locating one that seems to fit that location (the second and deeper of<br/>two minor minima in the region). Your very clever refinement in the<br/>second version of labelling the ratios for &quot;shallower&quot; minima or<br/>valeys using an arrangement of the type neatly fitting these numbers<br/>into the diagram looks like an ideal solution.</p><p>Smiling, I reflect that at least I erred in the right direction in my<br/>response to the first version: given my enthusiasm for 11:14, it&apos;s at<br/>least better that I &quot;underinterpreted&quot; a local minimum actually<br/>indicated in your diagram rather than &quot;overinterpreted&quot; something that<br/>might have been several cents off in either direction, for example. Of<br/>course, thank you for quickly enlightening me on the actual minimum<br/>that&apos;s there in the curve, and is now expressly identified by ratio.</p><p>What I did quickly note in that version was a local minimum for what I<br/>was pretty sure was 11:13 (~289.21 cents), very easy to confirm in the<br/>new version with its optimized spacing of type for the ratios.</p><p>If both 11:13 and 11:14 turn out to be distinct minima, this might fit<br/>the classic intuition that mediants often tend to identify points of<br/>relative simplicity between deeper &quot;valleys.&quot;</p><p>Once I did have the experience in a harmonic timbre of seeming to hear<br/>11:14 a bit &quot;smoother&quot; than the regular major third of 29-tET at about<br/>413.79 cents -- but maybe there were some timbre-specific factors (not<br/>necessarily common to other harmonic timbres), since at other times I<br/>have found a 29-tET major third somewhat &quot;milder&quot; than a third around<br/>11:14, or at least that was my casual impression.</p><p>As you might guess, I also got a kick out of seeing 14:17 as a local<br/>minimum on the second version. Would harmonic entropy theory suggest<br/>that 14:17:21 is maybe analogous to a Partchian &quot;otonal&quot; version, like<br/>6:7:9, with the smaller third placed below in the more &quot;natural&quot; or<br/>&quot;harmonic&quot; arrangement?</p><p>Also, might one make a fine distinction between &quot;rootedness&quot; where the<br/>lowest note of a sonority is equivalent to an octave of the<br/>&quot;fundamental&quot;; and &quot;anchoring&quot; which might be brought about by an<br/>interval such as 2:3, 4:5, or 4:7 above the lowest note, as in 6:7:9<br/>or 12:14:18:21, although the lowest note is not, strictly speaking,<br/>&quot;rooted&quot; -- giving it a &quot;rootlike&quot; quality?</p><p>By the way, I&apos;ll maybe share a little &quot;present&quot; here, something less<br/>artistically impressive than your curve and diagram, however -- but an<br/>item regarding a certain &quot;pet topic&quot; of mine.</p><p>Most appreciatively, and Happy Holidays to you and all,</p><p>Margo Schulter<br/><a href="mailto:mschulter@value.net">mschulter@value.net</a></p><p>P.S.
