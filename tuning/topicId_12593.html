I&apos;ve had performers doing my<br/>&gt;72-note stuff very prettily for some 30 years, now, and my<br/>&gt;quarter-tone stuff for another 10 before that.  (I have to admitthat<br/>&gt;the the quarter-tones, being less natural didn&apos;t come out so<br/>&gt;accurately, and now that I know better, I&apos;m glad.)</p><p>&gt;It has involved distributing electronic ponies to players of new<br/>&gt;pieces, getting wind players to compile charts of the fingerings<br/>they used in one of my pieces so that I could distribute them among<br/>new players, using live computer-generated sound (David Rayna&apos;s<br/>RTMPII<br/>&gt;system) as a continuo or accompaniment, or just being around at<br/>&gt;rehearsal to tell people when they were going wrong and get them out<br/>&gt;of difficulties.</p><p>&gt;(A good notation doesn&apos;t hurt.  I designed mine to be as transparent<br/>&gt;to tradiionally trained musicians as possible.  See:<br/>&gt;<a href="http://www.mindspring.com/~tmook/micro.html.)">http://www.mindspring.com/~tmook/micro.html.)</a></p><p>&gt;There are of course performers whose mind sets are too fixed or<br/>&gt;technical imaginations too impoverished to play me.  But there are<br/>at the moment three CDs in CRI&apos;s catalogue and one in Frogpeak&apos;s to<br/>show what can be done, often on laughably short rehearsal.</p><p>_________ ______ ___ __ _<br/>Joseph Pehrson</p></div>
