For this music, a cadential<br/>semitone of 16:15 (~112 cents) sounds &quot;just right&quot;: the elements fit<br/>together in beautiful proportion, and some patience with the comma<br/>complications seems well rewarded. Of course, Zarlino didn&apos;t say that<br/>this kind of keyboard would be easy to play; but it&apos;s fascinating, and<br/>wonderful, to play an actual syntonic diatonic kind of keyboard<br/>instrument following Zarlino&apos;s plan, albeit with &quot;split manuals&quot; (one<br/>version of D, Bb, F# on each 12-note keyboard) rather than split keys.</p><p>Shift the style, and something 81:80 or 56:55 higher than a 5:4 can<br/>sound equally &quot;just right&quot; and beautiful; since I can hear versions of<br/>an interval differently depending on the context, why shouldn&apos;t<br/>different people have a range of views and experiences also?</p><p>Bob and Jerry, as someone known to have been excluded from my high<br/>school choir because of an inability accurately to match pitches, what<br/>I&apos;d mainly urge might be a more relaxed approach to this important<br/>question -- and anything I say might carry the caution: &quot;Such lips,<br/>such lettuce&quot; (said by a Roman of a donkey eating thistles, and quoted<br/>by Thomas Morley in 1597 in his _A Plain and Easy Introduction to<br/>Practical Music_).</p><p>It&apos;s humorous, Francois: when you suggested that the choir was singing<br/>a major sixth at around 906 cents, and I noticed this number in some<br/>of the posts, my reaction was: &quot;That&apos;s a perfect 27:16!&quot; -- or would<br/>be, if the reading with its 5-cent error margin happened to be<br/>precisely what was happening.</p><p>If the group were performing 13th-14th century European music, that<br/>would be an ideal Pythagorean sixth, and quite an accomplishment --<br/>not necessarily to endorse all of the surrounding events including the<br/>pitch drift and an &quot;unhistorical&quot; type of keyboard sound, of course<br/>&lt;grin&gt; -- if it had been a synthesizer simulating the Halberstadt<br/>Organ, I&apos;d count that as more &quot;authentic.&quot;</p><p>Anyway, I should add that the Renaissance was my first great love when<br/>I took a course in music appreciation/history in high school, and that<br/>I still regard it as _one_ of the most perfect eras from my point of<br/>view.</p><p>Musing a bit on this &quot;high third&quot; discussion yesterday, I read a bit<br/>of Carl Dahlhaus. What he says about the music of Monteverdi and<br/>others around 1600 is really fascinating, and maybe captures at least<br/>part of how I go about improvising in this kind of style, as well as<br/>what I hear in the music of this epoch that I play on keyboard.</p><p>One of his conclusions is that music of this kind is based on a<br/>&quot;society&quot; of hexachord degrees which are &quot;coordinate,&quot; rather than in<br/>some kind of hierarchical relationship, whether defined by the<br/>traditional modal system or the key system of the later 17th century.</p><p>The flow of 5-limit consonance, with smooth progressions and few<br/>arbitrary limitations, is one of the real charms of this music; I must<br/>admit to making the usual period compromise of meantone most of the<br/>time, but it&apos;s nice to play now and then in real JI and take that in<br/>also.</p><p>Of course, Gothic/neo-Gothic and Renaissance/neo-Renaissance, along<br/>with their very different approaches to concord/discord contrasts and<br/>intonational styles, has some common assumptions that may knit<br/>together these sides of my musical life.</p><p>Reading Dahlhaus, and getting in touch again with both sides of this<br/>equation, makes me ask, for example, &quot;Why is it that the progression<br/>from major third to fifth can be so beautiful not only a Gothic kind<br/>of setting where it represents a resolution from instability to<br/>stability, but also in a Renaissance setting where it guides a<br/>progression between two 5-limit sonorities?&quot;</p><p>Maybe that&apos;s a special charm of the 16th century: a kind of special<br/>musical gravitation producing an orbital freefall of sorts as thirds<br/>and sixths are moving in old and familiar patterns -- but to new<br/>sonorities also with thirds or sixths. It&apos;s a kind of &quot;5-limit jazz.&quot;</p><p>An open question: might a Renaissance style invite something at or<br/>near adaptive 5-limit JI, and 17th-19th century tonality with its<br/>higher level of dissonance and tension something with narrower<br/>cadential semitones?</p><p>Maybe this is a bit like the old philosophical question: Is Bach<br/>played in a 31-note meantone cycle, or even say adaptive 5-limit JI,<br/>preferable to Bach in Werckmeister III say, or the Kellner tuning?</p><p>Anyway, Bob and Jerry, the least I can do is to appreciate the talents<br/>and effort you exert in your work with vocal ensembles.</p><p>Music history reveals that passionate dialogues are often the source,<br/>if not the occasion, for much vital theory; the recognition of this<br/>potential, even in the throes of controversy, might encourage<br/>passionate advocacy and enthusiastic friendship on all sides as the<br/>colloquies proceed.</p><p>Most appreciatively,</p><p>Margo Schulter<br/><a href="mailto:mschulter@value.net">mschulter@value.net</a></p></div><h3><a id=36279 href="#36279">ðŸ”—</a>jpehrson2 &#x3C;jpehrson@rcn.com&#x3E;</h3><span>4/6/2002 8:20:21 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In tuning@y..., &quot;M.

I<br/>understood it was to be a private affair, but then found the &quot;wrap up&quot; round<br/>posted on line. Okay. So be it. You have read it.</p><p>As I see it, the bottom line difference in point of view centered on Bob&apos;s<br/>value that an important goal regarding JI perception has to do with what he<br/>and Paul call pitch/frequency correlation. I asked for clarification<br/>(meaning &quot;how does this apply?&quot; and I got back word meanings (nothing I<br/>didn&apos;t know before) and accusations of being &quot;illogical.&quot;</p><p>Through that exchange, I learned that Bob believes that perception of a<br/>&quot;high third&quot; or any such anomaly is to be *overcome* by persistent practice.<br/>That would explain why he felt that his apparent &quot;change in perception&quot;<br/>supported his being &quot;right.&quot;</p><p>For a while, all hell broke out with accusations of my poor logic and<br/>refusal to see his points. I don&apos;t particularly think pitch/perception<br/>correlation in a worse/better sense applies here. (I won&apos;t go into the whys<br/>unless you think it of value.) But it was helpful to me to see clearly that<br/>there is no way that someone who views the &quot;high third&quot; as a *weakness* is<br/>going to relate to what I&apos;m trying to discover here.</p><p>That&apos;s where all of this has landed, at the moment, from my standpoint. Bob<br/>is certainly welcome, of course, to present his impressions, as well.</p><p>I wouldn&apos;t have posted this publicly except for *Bob&apos;s* recent public post.<br/>It&apos;s clear (by *your* delightful post) that the &quot;battle&quot; has become public<br/>news.</p><p>That may in fact prove to be helpful. When you see how well Bob and I will<br/>relate to each other, now that our points of view are understood, you&apos;ll be<br/>impressed how persistence in getting to the heart of an apparent difference<br/>in &quot;logic&quot; turns out to be a difference in *values*. Very interesting,<br/>indeed. (Why do I know Paul will find holes in all of this?)</p><p>Thanks, Joe, (and also Margo) for knowing just what to say to discharge an<br/>apparent explosive situation. As it works out, there *was* no explosion.<br/>Just a clearer understanding on both our parts.

Here I<br/>assume that first sonority of this cadence has a &quot;high third,&quot; while<br/>the sonority of arrival is a pure 4:5:6 (or actually 2:5:6:8).</p><p>The &quot;high third&quot; sonority is within Blackwood&apos;s &quot;acceptable&quot; range,<br/>with, under one interpretation, the greater acoustical tension of this<br/>third offering a constrast with the pure 5:4 in the following<br/>sonority, and thus reinforcing the cadential grammar.</p><p>An interesting consequence is a cadential semitone of only 94 cents,<br/>as opposed to the 16:15 (~111.73 cents) which would be involved if<br/>both sonorities had pure 5:4 thirds.</p><p>In a way, this might be one of those &quot;alternative hypotheses&quot;: might<br/>people, at least sometimes, sing a &quot;high third&quot; in a cadential context<br/>where both contextual and melodic motivations (narrower diatonic<br/>semitones) could play a part? However, since the &quot;high third&quot;<br/>reportedly may also occur in settings not involving cadential<br/>progressions, this may not fully address the question, and is offered<br/>as a kind of aside.</p><p>Whatever relevance this kind of hypothesis might have for the present<br/>&quot;high third&quot; discussion, I mention it as of possible historical<br/>interest for early Renaissance styles around the late 15th century,<br/>when theorists present an interesting mixture of Pythagorean and<br/>&quot;5-limit&quot; types of concepts and viewpoints. Suppose, for example, we<br/>revise our cadence to a variety common around the time of Ockeghem and<br/>the earlier Josquin, and indeed still common in the early 16th century<br/>when final sonorities with thirds are coming into wider vogue:</p><p>            B4  -------  +94 ------ C5<br/>          (404)                   (498)<br/>            G4  -------    0 ------ G4<br/>        (902,498)                (814,386)<br/>            D4  ------- +204 ------ C4<br/>     (1604,1200,702)         (2400,1902,1200)<br/>            G3  ------- -702 ------ C3</p><p>In this example, the sonority with a &quot;high third&quot; -- or a Pythagorean<br/>third slightly tempered in the narrow direction, one might say --<br/>resolves to a stable consonance of 1:2:3:4, a kind of conclusion which<br/>composers such as Palestrina still sometimes use in the later 16th<br/>century, although by the second quarter of the century a final third<br/>(typically major, by inflection if necessary in a given mode) is<br/>becoming the general norm.</p><p>Theorists of the late 15th century still often speak of the diatonic<br/>semitone as the _minor_ semitone, and here the size of 94 cents would<br/>fit this kind of description; the &quot;high third&quot; sonority is somewhat<br/>more smooth and restful than active medieval sonorities with<br/>Pythagorean thirds, but still has considerable tension.</p><p>In this cadence, the principal two-voice progression is between the<br/>tenor and highest voice: a major sixth (D4-B4) expands to the octave<br/>(C4-C5). At the same time, the outer voices have an M10-15 resolution<br/>of a kind which Zarlino (1558) will note as typical of multi-voice<br/>cadences.</p><p>By the time of Zarlino, a pervasive &quot;5-limit just&quot; ethos seems quite<br/>fitting, but in the Ockeghem/Josquin era, some kind of compromise<br/>between Pythagorean and 5-limit adaptive JI or meantone might have<br/>been in favor, at least in some areas.</p><p>Of course, I understand that the &quot;high third&quot; phenomenon you posit is<br/>something different, in which singers heard the actual 5:4 major third<br/>or 5:2 major tenth of a 4:5:6 or 2:3:5 sonority as having a<br/>subjectively &quot;higher&quot; location, and then sing a third at this<br/>perceived location (~404 cents?), finding the result pleasing.</p><p>Please note that I am here addressing the question of one possible<br/>approach to flexible pitch performance of certain cadential<br/>progressions in the later 15th century, rather than the tuning of<br/>fixed pitch instruments such as keyboards, which around 1450-1480 were<br/>evidently shifting from Pythagorean to meantone.</p><p>Another possible application of major thirds around 404 cents or so<br/>might be in an interpretation of Charles Ives calling for some kind of<br/>quasi-Pythagorean tuning where &quot;F# is closer to G than to F, and Eb is<br/>closer to D than to E&quot; (a paraphrase of some of Ives&apos; remarks reported<br/>here).</p><p>Anyway, here&apos;s a possible question to consider in maybe analyzing some<br/>choir performances: do &quot;high thirds&quot; tend to occur more in cadential<br/>situations than elsewhere?</p><p>Again, a lot of my experience is with keyboard tunings in a medieval<br/>or neo-Gothic kind of style where the norm for thirds is quite<br/>different; and I should emphasize that my experiences with a<br/>Renaissance style of 5-limit JI on keyboards, also, is a different<br/>situation than the kind of dynamic vocal intonation here in question.</p><p>Most appreciatively,</p><p>Margo Schulter<br/><a href="mailto:mschulter@value.net">mschulter@value.net</a></p></div><h3><a id=36334 href="#36334">ðŸ”—</a>M.

They just sounded better when &quot;bent&quot; in those directions. It was<br/>somewhat of a shock to find that many of the folks here consider F# to be<br/>lower than Gb. To each his own, but I would find such tuning pretty &quot;dumpy&quot;<br/>sounding.</p><p>Of course, having been subject (good word) to the high third &quot;illusion&quot;<br/>(apparently) all my life, I suppose that shouldn&apos;t be surprising.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Anyway, here&apos;s a possible question to consider in maybe analyzing some<br/>&gt; choir performances: do &quot;high thirds&quot; tend to occur more in cadential<br/>&gt; situations than elsewhere?</p><p>Interesting thought. The tendency of cadence chords to be more sustained<br/>makes it easier to identify tuning of thirds there. I, for one, do notice<br/>high thirds in cadences but I usually have no vivid impression of the tuning<br/>of the thirds sung elsewhere.</p><p>For example, I did &quot;catch&quot; high thirds in Bob&apos;s cadences (the Victoria he<br/>posted), but when I went back to listen more carefully I wasn&apos;t sure whether<br/>I was hearing *real* high thirds or illusionary ones.</p><p>In that regard, Paul asked me to listen again to his jerry10, in which a JI<br/>triad was immediately followed by an ET triad. The point of that test was to<br/>see whether folks would hear the third go up or down when the ET triad<br/>began. I&apos;m glad I did listen again because I learned something very<br/>interesting.</p><p>When I downloaded it, the music sounded very quickly, catching me by<br/>surprise. I obviously perceived the high third in this hearing as the third<br/>clearly &quot;went down.&quot; I played it a few more times, always hearing the ET<br/>third lower than the &quot;JI&quot; third.</p><p>After a few minutes, I went back and played jerry10 again, this time making<br/>an effort to focus on the pitch of the JI third rather than on the<br/>experience as a whole. This time the ET third &quot;went up.&quot; I listened a few<br/>more times with the same result.</p><p>Then I decided to alternate my focus between JI triad as a whole and the<br/>pitch of the third. Whenever I focused on the triad I heard the third drop,<br/>and when I focused on the third alone, it went up.</p><p>This insight prompted my memory of Bob&apos;s suggestion that hearing the high<br/>third for him seemed to be a product of what he called &quot;casual&quot; listening.<br/>His point, as I remember it, was that he had trained himself to &quot;overcome&quot;<br/>(ignore?) the &quot;illusion&quot; by careful listening.</p><p>I now suspect Bob and I have actually experienced the *same* phenomenon but<br/>have expressed our descriptions in different ways. This difference in<br/>language, incidentally, is what I think launched our &quot;disagreements.&quot; I<br/>evidently was bothered by his apparent attempt to *dismiss* the high third<br/>as perceptual error. He evidently was frustrated that I &quot;refused&quot; to see his<br/>reasoning. As I said to Joe, I believe our communication difficulties have<br/>more to do with differing values than with my &quot;faulty logic&quot; (as Bob and<br/>Paul maintain).</p><p>Thanks, Margo, for your expressed interest in this topic. I wish you could<br/>hear the sound items. Nevertheless, please continue to offer your point of<br/>view whenever you feel it may be helpful.</p><p>Jerry</p></div><h3><a id=36349 href="#36349">ðŸ”—</a>emotionaljourney22 &#x3C;paul@stretch-music.com&#x3E;</h3><span>4/11/2002 6:13:37 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In tuning@y..., Gerald Eskelin &lt;stg3music@e...&gt; wrote:</p><p>&gt; I believe our communication difficulties have<br/>&gt; more to do with differing values than with my &quot;faulty logic&quot; (as<br/>Bob and<br/>&gt; Paul maintain).</p><p>i&apos;m going to get to back to this logic stuff with you in private e-<br/>mail, when i get a chance. the logic issue is completely independent<br/>of the values issue -- the values could be exactly reversed and the<br/>logic problem would remain exactly as it is.</p><p>meanwhile, bob is only one of six other people here who listened to<br/>the example (and margo replicated it for herself). why be so<br/>concerned about what *he* heard? no one here is out to get you -- i<br/>think the vast majority of us here are as curious about tuning<br/>phenomena as you are, so i hope you&apos;ll trust us that we&apos;re &apos;on your<br/>side&apos; in trying to figure stuff out.</p><p>peace,<br/>paul</p><p>p.s. the other two incarnations of this list appear to be dead -- or<br/>is everyone just doing their taxes?</p></div><h3><a id=36362 href="#36362">ðŸ”—</a>robert_wendell &#x3C;rwendell@cangelic.org&#x3E;</h3><span>4/12/2002 11:25:59 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In tuning@y..., &quot;emotionaljourney22&quot; &lt;paul@s...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt; --- In tuning@y..., Gerald Eskelin &lt;stg3music@e...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; I believe our communication difficulties have<br/>&gt; &gt; more to do with differing values than with my &quot;faulty logic&quot; (as<br/>&gt; Bob and<br/>&gt; &gt; Paul maintain).<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; i&apos;m going to get to back to this logic stuff with you in private e-<br/>&gt; mail, when i get a chance. the logic issue is completely<br/>independent<br/>&gt; of the values issue -- the values could be exactly reversed and the<br/>&gt; logic problem would remain exactly as it is.</p><p>Bob comments:<br/>For those on this list who do not know, Jerry, Paul, and I have had<br/>extensive offline communications concerning this issue.

No one<br/>else&apos;s seemed to do so. *That&apos;s* why I referred to it. No &quot;concern&quot; that<br/>it&apos;s Bob&apos;s report. Actually, I consider his &quot;veteran&quot; report a kind of<br/>confirmation of what *I* experienced. His choice of words--&quot;casual&quot; and<br/>&quot;practiced&quot;--were particularly helpful to me in realizing that my &quot;gestalt&quot;<br/>(JI triad) and &quot;specific&quot; (JI third) perceptions were the key to<br/>understanding (apparently) my experience.</p><p>Let&apos;s drop the feud, Paul. I have already said *why* I thought Bob heard the<br/>same thing I heard. If you would like to deal with *that*, I&apos;m happy to<br/>respond. I have no paranoia regarding being &quot;gotten&quot; here on the list. In<br/>fact, I have no *problem* with being &quot;gotten,&quot; provided the basis for the<br/>&quot;getting&quot; is meaningful to me.</p><p>By the way, where is your response to my post stating that I was able to<br/>*predict* what I would hear in jerry10 by alternating between two different<br/>perceptual focuses? Don&apos;t you think that&apos;s important? I think it&apos;s<br/>*enormously* important. Isn&apos;t it *logically* possible that Bob (given his<br/>own statements about &quot;casual&quot; and &quot;practiced&quot; perceptions) had done the same<br/>thing (whether he thought so or not)? To my *logic*, it seems highly likely.<br/>If you think not, share your thoughts. (No blanket assumptions of poor<br/>logic, please. Be specific.)</p><p>Bob might have responded very early by saying, &quot;I understand the source of<br/>your question, Jerry, but here is why I think your query is off the mark.&quot;<br/>Instead, I got the defensive nonsense (to me) about my &quot;challenge&quot; of the<br/>naked JI third in jerry00 being heard as &quot;flat.&quot; My concerns were not<br/>challenging that possibility, simply pointing out that, when taken as a<br/>whole, Bob&apos;s &quot;flat&quot; report didn&apos;t seem to make as much sense to me as<br/>considering the JI triad third to be &quot;high&quot; in contrast to it. At that<br/>point, you simply said I was being &quot;illogical&quot; and ignored my reasons *why*<br/>I posed this possibility?</p><p>Having said that, let&apos;s consider why you and Bob seem to be feeling<br/>&quot;persecuted&quot; in this regard? Granted, I didn&apos;t always couch my thoughts in<br/>diplomatic phraseology. Nevertheless, my comments were never intended to<br/>*argue* one point over another. I was just pissed off because Bob was so<br/>*sure* he could not have been mistaken about the interpretation of his<br/>perceptions. (How *logical* is that?) I&apos;ve changed my reports here as I&apos;ve<br/>changed my mind about what I&apos;m hearing. (jerry10, for example.) I think<br/>that&apos;s the best way to come up with something valid.</p><p>Again, I DON&apos;T HAVE ANYTHING TO PROVE HERE. And the only thing I&apos;m &quot;against&quot;<br/>is assuming other people&apos;s thinking is illogical without checking their<br/>premises.</p><p>I suggest we focus on the evidence here and forget about the fuss.<br/>Please????</p><p>Jerry</p></div><h3><a id=36373 href="#36373">ðŸ”—</a>Gerald Eskelin &#x3C;stg3music@earthlink.net&#x3E;</h3><span>4/12/2002 7:41:35 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>On 4/12/02 2:48 PM, &quot;<a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>&quot; &lt;<a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>&gt; wrote:</p><p>&gt; Message: 16<br/>&gt;  Date: Fri, 12 Apr 2002 14:28:17 -0700 (PDT)<br/>&gt;  From: &quot;Mark G.

Unfortunately, it has been<br/>*trying* for those *trying* to make their statements clear to *each other*.</p><p>Last Wednesday I posted a response to Margo in which I stated (calmly and<br/>succinctly, I think) my most recent insight. If you missed it, here is the<br/>part that may be helpful in getting this thread back on track:</p><p>--------------</p><p>( from Message #36336)</p><p>In that regard, Paul asked me to listen again to his jerry10, in which a JI<br/>triad was immediately followed by an ET triad. The point of that test was to<br/>see whether folks would hear the third go up or down when the ET triad<br/>began. I&apos;m glad I did listen again because I learned something very<br/>interesting.</p><p>When I downloaded it, the music sounded very quickly, catching me by<br/>surprise. I obviously perceived the high third in this hearing as the third<br/>clearly &quot;went down.&quot; I played it a few more times, always hearing the ET<br/>third lower than the &quot;JI&quot; third.</p><p>After a few minutes, I went back and played jerry10 again, this time making<br/>an effort to focus on the pitch of the JI third rather than on the<br/>experience as a whole. This time the ET third &quot;went up.&quot; I listened a few<br/>more times with the same result.</p><p>Then I decided to alternate my focus between JI triad as a whole and the<br/>pitch of the third. Whenever I focused on the triad I heard the third drop,<br/>and when I focused on the third alone, it went up.</p><p>This insight prompted my memory of Bob&apos;s suggestion that hearing the high<br/>third for him seemed to be a product of what he called &quot;casual&quot; listening.<br/>His point, as I remember it, was that he had trained himself to &quot;overcome&quot;<br/>(ignore?) the &quot;illusion&quot; by careful listening.</p><p>I now suspect Bob and I have actually experienced the *same* phenomenon but<br/>have expressed our descriptions in different ways. This difference in<br/>language, incidentally, is what I think launched our &quot;disagreements.&quot; I<br/>evidently was bothered by his apparent attempt to *dismiss* the high third<br/>as perceptual error. He evidently was frustrated that I &quot;refused&quot; to see his<br/>reasoning. As I said to Joe, I believe our communication difficulties have<br/>more to do with differing values than with my &quot;faulty logic&quot; (as Bob and<br/>Paul maintain).</p><p>---------------</p><p>I suggest that you do a similar listen to jerry10, Joe. Alternately focus on<br/>the triad as a whole and then on the third alone. Let us know what happens.</p><p>Jerry</p></div><h3><a id=36401 href="#36401">ðŸ”—</a>Mark G.

Pehrson<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Joe, thanks for your continued interest here. I realize that it has<br/>been<br/>&gt; *trying* for those attempting to follow along. Unfortunately, it<br/>has been<br/>&gt; *trying* for those *trying* to make their statements clear to *each<br/>other*.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Last Wednesday I posted a response to Margo in which I stated<br/>(calmly and<br/>&gt; succinctly, I think) my most recent insight. If you missed it, here<br/>is the<br/>&gt; part that may be helpful in getting this thread back on track:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; --------------<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; ( from Message #36336)<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; In that regard, Paul asked me to listen again to his jerry10, in<br/>which a JI<br/>&gt; triad was immediately followed by an ET triad. The point of that<br/>test was to<br/>&gt; see whether folks would hear the third go up or down when the ET<br/>triad<br/>&gt; began. I&apos;m glad I did listen again because I learned something very<br/>&gt; interesting.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; When I downloaded it, the music sounded very quickly, catching me by<br/>&gt; surprise. I obviously perceived the high third in this hearing as<br/>the third<br/>&gt; clearly &quot;went down.&quot; I played it a few more times, always hearing<br/>the ET<br/>&gt; third lower than the &quot;JI&quot; third.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; After a few minutes, I went back and played jerry10 again, this<br/>time making<br/>&gt; an effort to focus on the pitch of the JI third rather than on the<br/>&gt; experience as a whole. This time the ET third &quot;went up.&quot; I listened<br/>a few<br/>&gt; more times with the same result.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Then I decided to alternate my focus between JI triad as a whole<br/>and the<br/>&gt; pitch of the third. Whenever I focused on the triad I heard the<br/>third drop,<br/>&gt; and when I focused on the third alone, it went up.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; This insight prompted my memory of Bob&apos;s suggestion that hearing<br/>the high<br/>&gt; third for him seemed to be a product of what he called &quot;casual&quot;<br/>listening.<br/>&gt; His point, as I remember it, was that he had trained himself<br/>to &quot;overcome&quot;<br/>&gt; (ignore?) the &quot;illusion&quot; by careful listening.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I now suspect Bob and I have actually experienced the *same*<br/>phenomenon but<br/>&gt; have expressed our descriptions in different ways. This difference<br/>in<br/>&gt; language, incidentally, is what I think launched<br/>our &quot;disagreements.&quot; I<br/>&gt; evidently was bothered by his apparent attempt to *dismiss* the<br/>high third<br/>&gt; as perceptual error. He evidently was frustrated that I &quot;refused&quot;<br/>to see his<br/>&gt; reasoning. As I said to Joe, I believe our communication<br/>difficulties have<br/>&gt; more to do with differing values than with my &quot;faulty logic&quot; (as<br/>Bob and<br/>&gt; Paul maintain).<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; ---------------<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I suggest that you do a similar listen to jerry10, Joe. Alternately<br/>focus on<br/>&gt; the triad as a whole and then on the third alone. Let us know what<br/>happens.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Jerry</p></div><h3><a id=36409 href="#36409">ðŸ”—</a>emotionaljourney22 &#x3C;paul@stretch-music.com&#x3E;</h3><span>4/15/2002 1:38:23 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In tuning@y..., Gerald Eskelin &lt;stg3music@e...&gt; wrote:</p><p>&gt; Paul, *your* concern with *my* logic seems focused on irrelevant<br/>issues, as<br/>&gt; I see it.

(I usually just lurk, but<br/>&gt; recent discussions have been something of an inspiration.)<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I am investigating to the nature of the pitches and intervals contained<br/>&gt; in certain spontaneous vocalization by local fauna.   I&apos;m trying to answer<br/>&gt; these questions:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Do these vocalizations contain vowel sounds?<br/>&gt; Is there a definite perceived pitch?<br/>&gt; What is the actual frequency range?<br/>&gt; Are particular pitches favored? Does it vary by individual?<br/>&gt; Do successive pitches form identifiable intervals?<br/>&gt; If such intervals are present, are they in JI, MT, or ET?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I have repeated the following experiment on five successive days: I wait<br/>&gt; until the vocalization starts (usually around 10:00 pm at night).  On the<br/>&gt; first night I observed a large tabby colored individual and a small black<br/>&gt; and white individual.   The sound could be described as<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Rrrrrrrrrrrreeerrrrr!   Hssss!  Hssss!<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; After penetration, the sound was more like:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Rrrrow!  Rrrrow!<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; The pitch initially seemed quite variable, but on closer listening, I<br/>&gt; was able to determine that there is definite center, but it changes<br/>&gt; rapidly and is unstable. With the aid of a keyboard, I determined that<br/>&gt; the approximate range from F2 to G5. I&apos;m not sure about the vowel sounds,<br/>&gt; but there are definitely sibilents in the &quot;Hssss&quot;.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Days two, three and four were similar (data tables will be included<br/>&gt; in a subsequent post).<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Last night I varied my listening routine by drinking two bottles of Scotch.<br/>&gt; At first, it seemed that the perceived pitch increased as I consumed more<br/>&gt; Scotch,  but this effect did not persist.  After the second bottle, I was<br/>&gt; surprised to find that there seemed to be definite order to the succession<br/>&gt; of pitches and pitch-less sounds.  In fact, there was an amazing resemblance<br/>&gt; to Chinese opera music.  However, the experiment was terminate prematurely<br/>&gt; when I threw the two empty Scotch bottles out the window.  A sudden silence<br/>&gt; ensued, allowing the tired experimenter to sleep.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Thank you in advance for your assistance, as I am very anxious to understand<br/>&gt; the tonal system of caterwaulering, and look forward to discussing it on<br/>&gt; this list at great length and detail, and engaging in vehement and protracted<br/>&gt; arguments about every minutia of this fascinating and important subject.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; (Sorry guys: I couldn&apos;t resist.

I&apos;m not sure why I have<br/>persisted this long; perhaps for the sport of it, perhaps to clarify issues<br/>in order to resume sane discussion. But the bottom line is that I need to<br/>get back to some pressing work.</p><p>Actually, this visit has produced some valuable information. We know now<br/>that the high third sometimes can be perceived while hearing a well-tuned JI<br/>triad. (Thanks to Paul for preparing the original jerries.) It seems that<br/>finding a *real* high third is not likely. (Thanks to Paul for the second<br/>set of jerries.) It also appears that the illusion can be defeated by<br/>focusing on the pitch of the third (tenth) as opposed to focusing on the JI<br/>triad as a whole. (Thanks to Paul&apos;s jerry10.) Bob&apos;s input regarding<br/>*learning* to ignore the high third was important in that regard, I think.</p><p>Whether or not ears seasoned in tuning (as here on the list) can &quot;retrain&quot;<br/>to experience the high third remains a question. Another question (actually<br/>related to the original one from last year) is why do singers tend to sing<br/>*actual* high thirds instead of simply tuning to JI and &quot;hearing&quot; the<br/>illusionary one. (Thanks to Francois for verifying frequencies on this.)</p><p>And thanks to you, Joe, for warmly welcoming me back to the list. More<br/>importantly, thanks for participating in the process by reporting your<br/>listening experiences. We *both* got the surprise of a lifetime when we<br/>realized we were hearing the high third generating from a JI triad. What a<br/>kick in the head!!!</p><p>A special thanks to Margo for offering her valuable and interesting points<br/>of view on the subject. New friends are important in keeping us fresh and<br/>alert to different ways of seeing things.</p><p>Finally, thanks to all who contributed to this inquiry, either by comments<br/>or by offering jerry reports. Also, thanks to the &quot;lurkers&quot; who sent me<br/>offline emails to offer encouragement, support or condolences (some of which<br/>were an interesting mixture of all three).</p><p>See you around,</p><p>Jerry</p><p>PS: Let me know if anything comes up that might be of interest, or which<br/>might benefit from some &quot;illogical&quot; thinking.  ;-)</p></div>
