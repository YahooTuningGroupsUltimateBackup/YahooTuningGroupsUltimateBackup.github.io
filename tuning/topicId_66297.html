Perhaps because it *would* be<br/>more effort and he was clearly jet-lagged.</p><p>In the event the instruments consisted of the small upright in a<br/>representative appropriate-for-Bach circulating temperament, and a<br/>grand in ET. Lindley thought at the last minute to demonstrate the<br/>effect of putting three pure thirds on top of each other with a<br/>harpsichord, but it turned out that the harpsichord-looking-after<br/>person had left the tuning hammer at home.</p><p>Difference in beats was demonstrated (quite audibly) by the method of<br/>holding down two keys silently or playing softly, then striking the<br/>beat note fortissimo staccato to excite the operative harmonics. I<br/>assume he would not have applied the same method to a hpcd...</p><p>Lindley then moved to his main point that late 17th, and 18th century<br/>circulating temperaments move more quickly &apos;down&apos; into the flats than<br/>they move &apos;up&apos; through the sharps. Also the claim that &apos;German&apos;<br/>circulating tunings are generally less unequal than &apos;French&apos;<br/>(presumably at comparable dates). Hence his own recipe or rather<br/>style-of-tuning-within-limits, more or less one part ordinaire plus<br/>one part equal - resulting here in three pure fifths from F through<br/>Ab.</p><p>Live demonstrations consisted of excerpts from various preludes of WTC<br/>I played from memory, both in the original keys and transposed.<br/>Despite the drawbacks of the small piano (on which I quite agree with<br/>Paul) there were audible differences in purity and musical effect<br/>between keys. The point as I understood it was that the character and<br/>compositional technique of the musical composition were tailored to<br/>the intonation of the key (- or was it vice versa?) He made it clear<br/>though that the key does not *uniquely* determine the sort of<br/>composition that would be particularly successful.</p><p>After the formal lecture Lindley outlined to me the crux of his<br/>musical case against Brad by first saying -  &apos;His E major is like my<br/>F# major&apos; [i.e. too hard &amp; impure] - playing the E major prelude<br/>suitably transposed - then &apos;His Ab major is too relaxed&apos; - playing<br/>that prelude in a lively and detached manner. We also noted the open<br/>fifth in b.5 of that piece, as opposed to the full Eb major chord when<br/>the analogous passage occurs in the dominant.</p><p>As a side remark, one can compare the E major prelude with its<br/>sustained consonant harmony, with the F# major prelude which has no<br/>chords and where even the implied harmonies are mostly dissonances.</p><p>Then we had the recorded organ examples (small Fisk instrument, as at<br/>the Michaelstein conference) where one point was the frequency of F#<br/>major appearing as a final chord, but the almost complete avoidance of<br/>C#/Db major in root position. (See BWV 687, 721 especially, 732.)<br/>Since this remark can hardly apply to the WTC, this was one apparent<br/>weak point, or at least one that needed to be cleared up, in a claim<br/>that Bach&apos;s harpsichord tuning preference followed a similar pattern<br/>to the organ tunings he wrote for. (Afterwards I got at least a slight<br/>clarification: published works were likely be played on meantone<br/>instruments, though most of Bach&apos;s organ works were unpublished, like<br/>the WTC.)</p><p>Another somewhat speculative reflection is the possible transposition<br/>of the C# WTC I prelude from a (musically inferior) original form in<br/>fewer sharps... but with more major thirds.</p><p>On the flat side we had some fine excerpts from O Mensch Bewein. Then<br/>Lindley connected the Klavieruebung III (with its three-flats<br/>dominance) with the visit to Naumburg which housed a new Hildebrandt<br/>organ with a &apos;Neidhardt&apos; tuning. Lindley&apos;s opinion is that the big Eb<br/>major emphasis in this publication was a signal to any would-be player<br/>that meantone or simple modifications were out. Staccato root position<br/>chords of Ab major and Db major in the big Prelude were mentioned as a<br/>sign of &apos;tailoring&apos; to a tuning in which these chords are still not so<br/>pure as others. The extremely chromatic end of the big Kyrie BWV 671<br/>was played, to somewhat startling effect. That was the one point at<br/>which I thought the Lindley style might be too unequal - indeed it is<br/>more unequal than the Neidhardts.</p><p>Recent developments were not treated in great musical or<br/>historiographical detail during the lecture - time was somewhat<br/>running out at that point. In any case I should not pre-empt the<br/>Lindley/Ortgies Early Music article which should appear relatively<br/>soon.</p><p>Then to dinner and to find out what Prof. L. had been doing in India<br/>for the previous three months - mostly school teaching...</p><p>Maybe I should not say it on this list, but there is a project<br/>(dependent on funding) to record WTC I a la Lindley with a<br/>professional pianist in Berlin.</p><p>~~~T~~~</p></div>
