Although his playing was<br/>extremely deep emotionally, and complex intellectually, he still had<br/>this to say ( in the August issue of GP mag)...&quot;Keep things simple.<br/>Don&apos;t fill your head with theory and numbers that have little to do with<br/>music.&quot; I agree...Hstick</p></div>
