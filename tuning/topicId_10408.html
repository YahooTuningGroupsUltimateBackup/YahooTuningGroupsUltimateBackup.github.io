Essentially, (and I realize many of you know more<br/>about this than I do), the principle is:  the more you study something, the<br/>more you change what you study.</p><p>I got to thinking that the intense study of the different keys of irregular<br/>temperaments allowed for the recognition of their different &quot;colors&quot; or<br/>characters.  The distinctive interval arrangements give off a gestalt blend,<br/>that is recognizable with study.  It seems to me that the different key<br/>characteristics may be a result of the Heisenberg Principle.</p><p>Johnny Reinhard<br/><a href="mailto:Afmmjr@aol.com">Afmmjr@aol.com</a></p></div>
