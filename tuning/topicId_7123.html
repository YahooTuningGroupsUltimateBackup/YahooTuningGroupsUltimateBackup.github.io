When he heard side by side piano performances<br/>&gt;&gt;of simple pieces in equal temperament and mean tone<br/>&gt;&gt;temperament he said that to his surprise he found that<br/>&gt;&gt;there was a big difference and that to him the mean<br/>&gt;&gt;tone version sounded better than did the equal tempered<br/>&gt;&gt;version.  After having heard the comparison, his reaction<br/>&gt;&gt;was that it seemed to him difficult to understand how<br/>&gt;&gt;equal temperament could have been universally adopted<br/>&gt;&gt;by the music world.<br/>&gt;<br/>And Paul Erlich replied:</p><p>&gt; Good work Dave! We need to expose all music professors to this!</p><p>Some of us are trying--and occasionally finding a ready and receptive<br/>audience. A few years ago I presented a lecture/demonstration on &quot;acoustic<br/>tuning&quot; (for lack of a better name) to the National Convention of the<br/>American Choral Directors Association. It was largely an attempt to<br/>demonstrate the difference between piano pitches and aural tuning and that<br/>listening to keyboard &quot;models&quot; of vocal &quot;parts&quot; would not likely lead to<br/>stunning performances. Some of those folks had never heard the difference,<br/>so needless to say it started some worthwhile conversation.</p><p>On the other hand, when I brought up the subject in regard to ear-training<br/>classes in our own department meeting, the chairman said, in effect, &quot;Jerry,<br/>why do you persist in this crusade; our music system is firmly based on<br/>twelve-tone equal temperament.&quot; Do you suppose the fact that he has authored<br/>a music fundamentals book based on that premise has anything to do with his<br/>position?</p><p>It ain&apos;t gonna be easy.</p><p>Gerald Eskelin</p></div><h3><a id=7171 href="#7171">ðŸ”—</a>Gerald Eskelin &#x3C;stg3music@xxxxxxxxx.xxxx&#x3E;</h3><span>12/21/1999 11:50:49 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>From Paul Erlich:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; 730-tET can be found in Paul Hahn&apos;s<br/>&gt; <a href="http://library.wustl.edu/~manynote/consist2.txt">http://library.wustl.edu/~manynote/consist2.txt</a><br/>&gt; (This chart only shows those ETs which have a higher consistency level at<br/>&gt; some harmonic limit than all lower-numbered ETs, and goes up to 10000TET.)<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; In Paul Hahn&apos;s terminology, 730-tET is consistent at the 5-limit to level<br/>&gt; 22, meaning that any interval constructed of any combination of up to 22<br/>&gt; consonant 5-limit intervals (minor thirds, major thirds, perfect fourths)<br/>&gt; will be represented the same way whether the interval is first computed in<br/>&gt; JI and then rounded to 730-tET, or if the consonant intervals are rounded to<br/>&gt; 730-tET first and then combined. By comparison, 12-tET is consistent at the<br/>&gt; 5-limit only to level 3: the ratio  648:625 (often called the greater<br/>&gt; diesis) can be constructed from four 6:5 minor thirds; while four minor<br/>&gt; thirds (minus an octave) add up to a unison in 12-tET, the actual size of<br/>&gt; 648:625 in JI is 62.565 cents, so it rounds up to one step in 12-tET. 53-tET<br/>&gt; is consistent at the 5-limit to level 8.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Bosanquet&apos;s 612-tET is almost as good, as it is consistent at the 5-limit to<br/>&gt; level 21. In order to improve on the consistency level of 730-tET in the<br/>&gt; 5-limit, one would have to go up to 1783-tET, which is consistent to level<br/>&gt; 42 (heh, I just said level 42), and then to improve on that, 4296-tET is<br/>&gt; 5-limit consistent to level 119. Note that 4296 is a multiple of 12. So if<br/>&gt; you wanted to get a 12-tET-based synthesizer to provide ridiculously exact<br/>&gt; JI (5-limit consonances within 0.002 cents of just), you could design it to<br/>&gt; divide the semitone into 4296/12 = 358 equal parts . . . Being a little more<br/>&gt; realistic, note that 612 is also divisible by 12 and gives 5-limit<br/>&gt; consonances within 0.093 cents of just . . .<br/>&gt;<br/> Jis 1 questshun. Duz ah need ta no dis stuff tah sang da blues? :-)</p><p>(No disrespect, Paul; just couldn&apos;t resist.)</p><p>GRE</p></div>
