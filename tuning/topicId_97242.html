That (and 2:1 of course) make for audible rational structures. The alleged 5:4 certainly does not- a structure based on a pure 5:4 deviates radically from one based on a 12-tET M3, in the very first iterations, for it is a simple truth of 5:4 that in three steps of the interval you arrive at a very strong dissonance with the octave, whereas three steps of the 12-tET M3 gives you a pure octave. This is radically different.</p><p>Strength and beauty in 12-tET come not feeble mimesis of naturally occuring proportions. It is the willful pride of NOT being a 5:4 that gives the M3 of 12-tET its value. As it is the humility of the 3:2 in quarter-comma meantone, surrendering its brilliance to the sweetness of the 5:4, that makes that system of intervals strong.</p><p>In neither case are structures built on the true properties of the rational intervals. In quarter-comma meantone, the artificial (in the old sense of the word) world created can create the illusion of a structure based on both 5:4 and 3:2, due to the purity of the third and fifth&apos;s endurance to temperament, but the price is the gauze and candlelight.</p><p>Anyway we seem to be in agreement that in 14-edo we are not going to find a meaningful structure based on rational proportions found within the more or less audible harmonic series.</p></div><h3><a id=97259 href="#97259">ðŸ”—</a>cityoftheasleep &#x3C;igliashon@...&#x3E;</h3><span>3/23/2011 4:10:29 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;lobawad&quot; &lt;lobawad@...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt; Anyway we seem to be in agreement that in 14-edo we are not going to &gt; find a meaningful structure based on rational proportions found<br/>&gt; within the more or less audible harmonic series.<br/>&gt;</p><p>Reall?

The posts back then were sparser, the egos calmer, and the tone was more frequently genial, but I don&apos;t see fewer disagreements, and the disagreements in general were no less trivial).  I do see a lot of conventions being established with great rapidity by a few people.  Perhaps a lot of the problems you&apos;re seeing now are due to the fact that a lot of new people have joined the list and are confronting conventions (and in general a whole way of approaching tuning) that they had no hand in establishing, and which are also very poorly documented, but which are accepted almost dogmatically by the people who remain from the early days of the list.</p><p>Much of the unproductiveness that goes on here these days comes from the fact that the new people have arrived here from many different backgrounds, and are unwilling to dogmatically accept the &quot;advances&quot; made in the early days.  In the early days, it seems like the demographics of the list were more homogenous, and perhaps this is one reason consensus was so much easier to come by.  I don&apos;t blame anyone for being frustrated by the fact that strangers wander into this list and start trying to tear down the established conventions willy-nilly without first spending adequate time to understand them.  Nor do I blame anyone for being frustrated when other strangers come in, absorb a bit of the conventions, and then turn and run off in a tangent with them.</p><p>However, I see this response as an inevitable consequence of exposing non-academic musicians to the concepts that evolved here.  If the people here who established the conventions did so with the genuine desire that they should infiltrate the larger musical community, it was naive of them to expect people not to misinterpret or challenge those conventions.  Especially when the conventions are nowhere summarized in transparent English.</p><p>I mean, as a philosophy major, I am no stranger to dense, abstruse treatises on heavily abstract subjects, nor am I a stranger to byzantine logical constructions--I&apos;ve read Carnap&apos;s _The_Logical_Structure_of_the_World_, for &quot;Bob&apos;s&quot; sake, and it doesn&apos;t get more arcane than that!--and yet it&apos;s taken me *years* of one-on-one discourse with Paul (and more recently, Carl) to get a decent grasp on the foundational principles of the various existent conventions here.  Understanding *what* was being talked about wasn&apos;t the hard part, but the *why* and the *how*--why are these conventions important, and how do I apply them to music?  And I&apos;m *still* not convinced of their worth, after all of this.</p><p>If two of the best teachers on this List need so much time to explain this material to a person like myself--educated, diligent, logical, and genuinely interested in understanding them--what does that say about the potential relevance of this material to the musical world at large?</p><p>To you List &quot;Fathers&quot; who are so deeply frustrated by the current state of things here: perhaps you should not be entirely blaming the influx of new people for the degeneration.  Perhaps you should take some responsibility yourselves for not taking the time to consider how the conventions you so quickly established might be received by the larger musical community in general.  If you had, then perhaps the state of things would not be so deplorable.</p><p>-Igs</p></div><h3><a id=97308 href="#97308">ðŸ”—</a>genewardsmith &#x3C;genewardsmith@...&#x3E;</h3><span>3/24/2011 12:08:06 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, Mike Battaglia &lt;battaglia01@...&gt; wrote:</p><p>&gt; That&apos;s worth a shot, but isn&apos;t going to fix the main problem around<br/>&gt; here by any means.</p><p>I think adding to the problem of too many existing groups and forums will not fix anything.</p></div><h3><a id=97312 href="#97312">ðŸ”—</a>genewardsmith &#x3C;genewardsmith@...&#x3E;</h3><span>3/24/2011 12:23:56 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;cityoftheasleep&quot; &lt;igliashon@...&gt; wrote:</p><p>&gt; I do see a lot of conventions being established with great rapidity by a few people.</p><p>These conventions are?

I *do* like some tunings better than others, but nothing I&apos;ve encountered here helps me to understand *why*.  Is it something inexpressible that just comes down to my personality type?  And if so, doesn&apos;t that mean it&apos;s going to be like that for everyone--a matter of personal taste?
