But that&apos;s not how Rothenberg uses the word &quot;efficient&quot;.  He uses it to mean the amount of key-locating information, per tone, that a scale can provide.  Which means that the most individual scales are the _least_ efficient, since it doesn&apos;t take much before the listener knows the key.  IOW, efficient scales are the _slowest_ at telling you their key.</p><p>Perhaps I&apos;m just not getting this... but it seems that this concept is a<br/>little &quot;backwards&quot; in terminology (??)  What exactly is an efficient<br/>scale &quot;efficient&quot; in?? Not revealing itself?  Not doing anything... so<br/>that the composer has to do it??   Why on earth would that be<br/>&quot;efficient??&quot; This seems a little peculiar to me, but, then, this is<br/>totally taken out of context of the articles...</p><p>Speaking of which, where can one find the Rothenberg articles or books?<br/>I&apos;m not finding anything on line on John Starrett&apos;s site or anyplace...</p><p>Thanks again for the help!!!</p><p>__________ ____ ___ __ _<br/>Joseph Pehrson</p></div><h3><a id=11229 href="#11229">ðŸ”—</a>Carl Lumma &#x3C;CLUMMA@NNI.COM&#x3E;</h3><span>7/25/2000 8:14:53 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>It&apos;s a confusing topic,</p><p>&gt;Thanks to Carl Lumma for explaining Rothenberg&apos;s concept of &quot;efficiency...&quot;:</p><p>and I&apos;m not sure I&apos;m helping, writing these posts between waking and going<br/>to work.</p><p>&gt;Perhaps I&apos;m just not getting this... but it seems that this concept is a<br/>&gt;little &quot;backwards&quot; in terminology (??)

Why on earth<br/>&gt;would that be &quot;efficient??&quot;</p><p>What does it mean to know that we are in the A-major key of the diatonic<br/>scale?  Rothenberg wants to know.  He thinks that all scales are not<br/>created equal here -- that it means more to know the key of the diatonic<br/>scale, than say, of the harmonic minor.  In this sense, the diatonic<br/>scale is called more &quot;efficient&quot;, because you get more key information out<br/>of it.  Efficiency is a measure of key information per note of the scale.</p><p>&gt;Speaking of which, where can one find the Rothenberg articles or books?<br/>&gt;I&apos;m not finding anything on line on John Starrett&apos;s site or anyplace...</p><p>Go to: <a href="http://www.egroups.com/group/tuning/">http://www.egroups.com/group/tuning/</a></p><p>...and put message number &quot;4044&quot; in the &quot;jump to&quot; box.
