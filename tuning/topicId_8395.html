Your 7-limit JI files are<br/>appreciated; stronger/driftier rendition would also be welcomed.<br/>5-limit meantone tunings do sound nice, but we hear them all the time<br/>(considering that 12-equal is a meantone tuning)</p><p>There will always be a demand for snack bars (12-equal), fancy restaurants<br/>(meantone, well-tempered, conventional 5-limit), but some of us also like<br/>mexican food. As well as french cuisine, indian curry...</p><p>Could we have a discussion on the tuning list to try and classify microtonal<br/>intonations/temperaments into categories (ranging from conservative to more<br/>liberal)? Maybe there is a need for this kind of labels.</p><p>-Kami ROUSSEAU</p></div>
