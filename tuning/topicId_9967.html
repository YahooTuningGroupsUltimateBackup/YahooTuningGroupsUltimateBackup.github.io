The topic here is<br/>&quot;synthetic&quot; perception... meaning the perception of tone as a &quot;fused&quot;<br/>element... ie. a sound comprised of a basic tone and all its<br/>accompanying Fourier partials that lend it&apos;s timbre as a single<br/>sensation.</p><p>From the text, it seems as if the entire concept of a tone with<br/>accompanying harmonic partials that determine its timbre is a &quot;new&quot; idea<br/>at that time.</p><p>This was not an &quot;original&quot; idea with Helmholtz, was it??  What is the<br/>history of this concept?? Paul?? Anybody??</p><p>In any case, the theory seems new and Helmholtz is looking for examples<br/>to back it up.  He unfortunately wanders into the realm of taste... or<br/>is it tastelessness (??)</p><p>(Some of this makes our short-lived &quot;Mark C.&quot; interchanges maybe not<br/>quite so weird after all!)</p><p>Here is the great Helmholtz in the kitchen:</p><p>&quot;Let us begin with the comparatively simple perceptions of the sense of<br/>taste.  The ingredients of our dishes and the spices with which we<br/>flavour<br/>them, are not so complicated that they could not be readily learned by<br/>any<br/>one.</p><p>[NB, JP]:<br/>And yet there are very few people who have not themselves practically<br/>studied cookery, that are able readily and correctly to discover, by the<br/>taste alone, the ingredients of the dishes placed before them.</p><p>How much practice, and perhaps also peculiar talent, belongs to wine<br/>tasting for<br/>the purpose of discovering adulterations is known in all wine-growing<br/>countries.  Similarly for smell; indeed the sensations of taste and<br/>smell<br/>may unite to form a single whole.  Using our tongues constantly, we are<br/>scarcely aware that the peculiar character of many articles of food and<br/>drink, as vinegar or wine, depends on the sensation of smell, their<br/>vapours<br/>entering the back part of the nose through the gullet.  It is not till<br/>we<br/>meet with persons in whom the sense of smell is deficient that we learn<br/>how<br/>essential a part it plays in tasting.  Such persons are constantly in<br/>fault<br/>when judging of food, as indeed any one can learn from his own<br/>experience,<br/>when he suffers from a heavy cold in the head without having a loaded<br/>tongue...&quot;</p></div>
