I&apos;m 43 yrs. old<br/>and have been playing guitar since 1973 (electric and acoustic).<br/>I&apos;ve been tooling up to build guitars for quite some time. Have<br/>been involved in various bands and have a deep interest in<br/>studying music theory and musicology. I&apos;ve been studying Just<br/>Intonation for the past few months and cannot believe how this topic<br/>has escaped my attention for so many years (Thank God for the<br/>internet).</p><p>After reading and studying JI for a number of months, I get the<br/>feeling that my electric guitars (based on 12tET)are simply on &quot;stand<br/>by&quot; as I venture to make the move to JI tunings.</p><p>I am interested in any information/contacts regarding where or who I<br/>can talk to with regard to the drawbacks or advantages of using a<br/>fretless neck or fretted neck on both acoustic and electric guitars.<br/>I<br/>understand there is a muddy sound as well as a sustain problem with<br/>fretless guitars.</p><p>I know this is probably information that has been discussed quite<br/>deeply in<br/>the group but I simply need a place to start.</p><p>I&apos;m sure I will be able to help others as I learn and explore this<br/>fascinating group.</p><p>Thanks</p><p>Wally</p></div><h3><a id=16919 href="#16919">ðŸ”—</a>Paul H.
