Either where it all began, or a tuner begins? Does<br/>the scale or system begin at Middle C, or some other note? And if<br/>so, does the system progress from some Zero point and progress<br/>infinitely, technically, through the range of the human ear? Or does<br/>the system start in the middle, at Middle C, and move down through<br/>the lower notes, and move up through the upper notes, away from some<br/>starting point in the middle?&quot;</p><p>any pitch on the piano is equally valid as a starting point. the entire system looks exactly the same from the vantage point of any pitch as &quot;center&quot;. that&apos;s how equal temperament works -- all the consecutive intervals are 2^(1/12), and no single pitch is differentiated as the &quot;center&quot;. most piano music, however, uses a particular pitch as the &quot;tonic&quot; or &quot;center&quot;, at least for a while, before changing to a different &quot;center&quot;. we could discuss this at length, but this is really a general music question, not a tuning question . . .</p><p>lawrence ball wrote,</p><p>&quot;PIANO/SAROD IMPROV CONCERTS OCT. 23 and 26&quot;</p><p>how are the pianos being tuned for these concerts?</p><p>joseph pehrson wrote,</p><p>&quot;***I would also like to add the phenominon of the &quot;shrinking<br/>interval...&quot; After listening to 1/6th tones for a while, for<br/>example, quartertones start sounding like *semitones!*&quot;</p><p>yes, this too is a real phenomenon, described in a different form by gary morrison, for example. this seems symptomatic of trying to write melodies with teensy tiny intervals -- then the good old-fashioned intervals seem really large. it&apos;s amazing how, in only a few weeks, one can get oneself into a state where the western diatonic scale -- defended for generations as some kind of supra-humanly eternal entity -- can sound distorted and gross beyond all expectations.</p><p>joseph also wrote,</p><p>&quot;***Don&apos;t forget, too, that if you start with the lowest C on the<br/>piano and make a circle of fifths, the circle closes exactly the time<br/>you reach the very *highest* C on the piano! Surely, that can&apos;t be<br/>just coincidence!&quot;</p><p>yes, that&apos;s just a coincidence.</p><p>joe monzo wrote,</p><p>&quot;the 5-limit consistency for various popular EDOs ...<br/>at least, i *hope* that&apos;s what they show!&quot;</p><p>well, the term &quot;consistency&quot; is already overworked and has too many meanings . . . &quot;5-limit consistency&quot; is already defined and is a simple yes/no for any given equal temperament, with a &quot;level&quot; as an optional additional parameter . . . i suggest you think of a different term for what you&apos;re illustrating here, perhaps something using the words &quot;just&quot; and &quot;rounding&quot; . . . also, i&apos;ve e-mailed you off-list with more specific comments about this page and your equal temperament page . . .</p><p>david beardsley wrote (of monz&apos; solar system chord):</p><p>&quot;So what&apos;s the tuning - in ratios?&quot;</p><p>david, if one fires a dart at the real number line, the probability of hitting a rational number is exactly zero. so i&apos;m not sure why you would assume that the chord was, or should be, expressed in ratios. the orbits of neptune and pluto are indeed in a resonant ratio, 3:2 if i recall correctly, but the other planets don&apos;t interact strongly enough with one another to pull their periods into &quot;just&quot; relationships. meanwhile, the comment was made that the chord resembled a major triad, so if you&apos;re going to force it into a set of ratios, i think you already know what the answer is . . .</p><p>robert walker provided a link that told us:</p><p>&quot;In 1867 a typewriter pioneer first set up the QWERTY arrangement so his salesman could peck out the word typewriter quickly and easily. The letters that spell typewriter all lie on the top row. Just think! That&apos;s the logic that shaped your computer keyboard. &quot;</p><p>thanks robert, for dispelling (no pun intended) all the myths about how this arrangement came about! so it&apos;s really all about the word &quot;typewriter&quot;. wow!</p><p>---------------------------------<br/>Do you Yahoo!?<br/>Faith Hill - Exclusive Performances, Videos, &amp; more<br/><a href="http://faith.yahoo.com">faith.yahoo.com</a></p></div><h3><a id=39368 href="#39368">ðŸ”—</a>Joseph Pehrson &#x3C;jpehrson@rcn.com&#x3E;</h3><span>10/8/2002 2:31:01 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In tuning@y..., wally paulrus &lt;wallyesterpaulrus@y...&gt; wrote:</p><p><a href="/tuning/topicId_39325.html#39325">/tuning/topicId_39325.html#39325</a></p><p>&gt; joseph also wrote,<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &quot;***Don&apos;t forget, too, that if you start with the lowest C on the<br/>&gt; piano and make a circle of fifths, the circle closes exactly the<br/>time<br/>&gt; you reach the very *highest* C on the piano!
