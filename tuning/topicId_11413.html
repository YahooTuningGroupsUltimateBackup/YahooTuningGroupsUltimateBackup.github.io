I could only see the keys.</p><p>&gt; I remember a recording of the Forelle (Trout) Quintet with<br/>&gt; a Hammerfluegel. That tuning did not strike me as unusual.<br/>The Hammerfl&uuml;gel or &quot;Hammerklavier&quot; became popular at that moment. Just a<br/>normal keyboard and almost simular to the modern grand piano. 31-tet is in<br/>the word &quot;Harmonie&quot;, of course.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I had no idea that 31-tone tuning would be used by these<br/>&gt; composers. (Imagine finding a piece by Mozart for a 31-ET<br/>&gt; mechanical glass harmonica!) I am very interested in any related info<br/>&gt; or leads for study.</p><p>The Glassharmonika (by Benjamin Franklin) was also in the Museum, in almost<br/>perfect condition : only one glass-bowl was broken. Sorry for the 31-tet,<br/>but it has just 12 bowls in every octave. Great to have a close look at it,<br/>anyhow.</p><p>--Wim</p></div>
