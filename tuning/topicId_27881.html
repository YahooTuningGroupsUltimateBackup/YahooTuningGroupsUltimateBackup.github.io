This will<br/>result, not in a just 1200-cent octave, but a _stretched_ octave, due<br/>to the inharmonicity of piano strings. In lower ranges, it&apos;s typical<br/>to tune the 4th partial of the lower note to the 2nd partial of the<br/>higher note, and in the lowest ranges, the 6th partial of the lower<br/>note to the 3rd partial of the higher note. This is because the<br/>partials in these ranges contribute more to the sense of &quot;in-tune/out-<br/>of-tune&quot; than do the lower partials of these low notes.</p></div><h3>BobWendell@technet-inc.com</h3><span>9/5/2001 3:09:55 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Hi, Joseph! Bob Wendell here. My apologies for the recent inactivity<br/>in this group. It had gotten a bit addictive as others have noted and<br/>I have had to attend to myriad other things.</p><p>On your question, the stretched octave is not a recent innovation. It<br/>is done, as you must know, because of the inharmonicity of piano<br/>strings, notably the shorter high strings where the stiffness is<br/>relatively high as related to string length.</p><p>My father, among many other things, was an ace piano tuner..always<br/>standard 12-tET tuning, though. He could set the temperament and tune<br/>impeccably in one hour flat! His tunings would hold extremely well<br/>for amazingly long times, too, if the instrument was decent.<br/>Unbelievably skilled with the hammer.</p><p>He taught me to tune when I was in high school (late 50s to early<br/>60s). His trick was to tune the upper octaves using both the lower<br/>octave and the fourth above it as references to set the upper<br/>octave. He would alternate back and forth between the lower octave<br/>and the fourth as references for tuning the upper octave.</p><p>Since the fourths are sharp in 12-tET, this cumulatively biases the<br/>tuning upwards as you move higher. The inharmonicity is a bit tricky,<br/>though, for the human ear used to tuning just octaves down lower (and<br/>essentially just fourths and fifths timing slow beats around the<br/>middle C range and even slower moving down into the bass region). The<br/>octave reference therefore serves as a backup check.</p><p>The alternation between the lower octave and the fourth above it<br/>provides a continual reality check on just how much stretch is<br/>enough. The fourths can put you out of touch with the tuning enough<br/>to skew you too far &quot;north&quot; on the octaves even with the<br/>inharmonicity unless you use the octave check to ensure that you&apos;re<br/>remaining within the bounds of a good clean tuning.</p><p>Hope this is a useful answer. Your teacher may have intuitively done<br/>the same thing without this technique, perhaps without even realizing<br/>it. Then again he may have realized it, but since he may not have had<br/>such a technique to truncate the need for the otherwise long<br/>experience needed to develop his intuitive approach, he may have<br/>considered it too subtle a point to teach within the allotted time.</p><p>--- In tuning@y..., jpehrson@r... wrote:<br/>&gt; I was wondering if anybody had any commentary on this...<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Back when I was in college, about 1970 or so...

The<br/>well-known and often-quoted research on the relationship of pitch to<br/>frequency, citing the tendency of the human ear, independent of the<br/>inharmonicity of piano strings, to stretch frequency in both<br/>directions from the mid-range is, in my humble opinion, fundamentally<br/>flawed.</p><p>The very significant problem of the relevance of ear training in the<br/>subjects used for this research is not typically addressed. (Ear<br/>training as used here is from a tuning perspective and not simply in<br/>terms of interval recognition, sight singing, etc.) I propose that we<br/>cannot expect non-musicians or musicians not trained in reliably<br/>recognizing just harmonies to give musically valid results for any<br/>such research. The non-musical laiety especially, cannot be relied<br/>upon to provide anything but information on how poorly untrained ears<br/>correlate pitch and frequency.</p><p>The whole basis of just tuning, as we well know here, is in the whole-<br/>number relationships between and among objective FREQUENCIES rather<br/>than some subjective and even musically naive sense of pitch. Over<br/>time, musical ears with good training in the art and science of<br/>tuning learn to correlate pitch much more accurately with frequency<br/>than these studies typically represent.
