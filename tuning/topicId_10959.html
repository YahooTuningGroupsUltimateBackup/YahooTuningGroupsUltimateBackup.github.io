With syntonic comma variations in 5-limit or higher just<br/>intonation (JI), however, conventional notation does not distinguish<br/>between the two flavors of D in the just fifths G-D and D-A, for<br/>example, so new systems are not merely an option but a necessity.</p><p>Also, notational systems can reflect musical contexts: my Pythagorean<br/>spelling for 53-tet, or 22-tet for that matter, might be radically<br/>different than a spelling taking 5-limit intervals (e.g. C-E as a<br/>near-5:4 rather than a near-81:64 or near-9:7) as the norm.</p><p>As far as Marchettus, for now I would like simply to emphasize that my<br/>&quot;Xeno-Gothic&quot; using complex Pythagorean tuning is merely one modern<br/>approach to the musical implementation of one _possible_ reading of<br/>what Marchettus says about cadential aesthetics.</p><p>In this reading, Marchettus seems to call for very narrow cadential<br/>semitones which he describes as &quot;dieses&quot; of around &quot;one of the five<br/>parts of a whole-tone&quot; in cadential resolutions, for example, from<br/>major third to fifth or from major sixth to octave.</p><p>This language _suggests_ that these cadential thirds and sixths may<br/>have been considerably larger than Pythagorean. If so, and people such<br/>as Joe Monzo here have offered alternative scholarly interpretations,<br/>then such intervals might possibly be located somewhere in the range<br/>of around 408-455 cents for major thirds before fifths, or 906-955<br/>cents for major sixths before octaves.</p><p>The idea is simply &quot;a major third or sixth somewhere between the usual<br/>Pythagorean size and something verging on a narrow fourth or minor<br/>seventh.&quot; This is itself a controversial interpretation, and any<br/>specific value within the range is a guess as to what certain singers<br/>or instrumentalists following Marchettus _might_ have done, very<br/>likely by ear, without concerning themselves with precise ratios,<br/>Pythagorean or otherwise.</p><p>(Here I would emphasize that Xeno-Gothic is a keyboard tuning, and<br/>that Marchettus is discussing the intonation of cadences in general<br/>terms, without any statements about the ratios of cadential thirds or<br/>sixths, or about keyboard tunings or temperaments.)</p><p>Please let me emphasize that the use of complex Pythagorean ratios is,<br/>as far as I know, strictly my modern means of obtaining values (around<br/>431 cents and 929 cents respsectively) which can be implemented on a<br/>keyboard making available conventional Pythagorean intervals also. A<br/>modern interpreter might just as reasonably favor a major third of<br/>6/17 octave in 17-tet; 8/22 octave in 22-tet; or 19/53 octave in<br/>53-tet.</p><p>Similarly, someone seeking to play compositions of the organist Conrad<br/>von Paumann from around 1450, and finding meantone appropriate, might<br/>choose 1/4-comma temperament as one possible realization, although the<br/>amount of temperament favored in the first decades of meantone remains<br/>unrecorded, and Gaffurius in 1496 was content to say that the fifths<br/>were narrowed by &quot;a certain small and hidden quantity.&quot;</p><p>For the moment, I would conclude by noting a certain paradox:<br/>Xeno-Gothic offers one possible realization of Marchettan cadences on<br/>a keyboard using complex Pythagorean ratios, when Marchettus himself<br/>was well known for his disregard of the niceties of Pythagorean<br/>mathematics. Maybe this is itself a touch of very late 20th-century<br/>mannerism.</p><p>Most appreciatively,</p><p>Margo Schulter<br/><a href="mailto:mschulter@value.net">mschulter@value.net</a></p></div>
