I called the whole<br/>thing the &quot;biosphere,&quot; which is I think a collection of biomes. Here&apos;s<br/>what I have so far:</p><p><a href="http://xenharmonic.wikispaces.com/The+Biosphere">http://xenharmonic.wikispaces.com/The+Biosphere</a></p><p>Basic ideas so far: I called the &quot;ultrapyth&quot; temperament &quot;oceanfront,&quot;<br/>which kind of reflects what I see in my head when I hear it. There<br/>should be an actual &quot;ultrapyth&quot; temperament as well, which should be<br/>2.3.5.7.13, with maybe an 11-limit extensions as well. I&apos;m not sure<br/>how to set that one up yet. Oceanfront is also a decent temperament to<br/>mix with porcupine, and I called the result &quot;porcupinefish,&quot; which is<br/>an actual type of fish.</p><p>I called the 91/90 and 64/63 linear temperament &quot;tropic,&quot; because it<br/>is both a biome and an island temperament. It&apos;s also related to<br/>semaphore. Many temperaments that go under the archipelago will<br/>probably also go here.</p><p>Lastly, I have a thing for &quot;pandora&quot; temperament down there -<br/>something about 46-equal made me think of avatar, and I wanted to find<br/>a suitable linear temperament to name &quot;pandora.&quot; I ran out of time<br/>before I could work it out. Ideally I&apos;d set it up so that meets all of<br/>the following features:<br/>- decently pure harmonies (around what 46-equal offers)<br/>- slightly sharp fifths, between those of 46-equal and 17-equal<br/>- ideally not too complex, but I&apos;ll take what I can get.</p><p>If you want to do work on the 91/90 temperament, stumble on one that<br/>meets the above requirements, and don&apos;t mind calling it &quot;pandora,&quot; go<br/>for it. If not, I&apos;ll find something at some point that works for<br/>pandora.</p><p>Lastly, I think some of the scales Igs has posted about in the past -<br/>like the scales that &quot;superficially resemble porcupine&quot; but harmonize<br/>differently - might turn out to be biome temperaments, so watch for<br/>those too.</p><p>That should get us started!</p><p>-Mike</p></div><h3><a id=98571 href="#98571">ðŸ”—</a>Mike Battaglia &#x3C;battaglia01@...&#x3E;</h3><span>4/24/2011 6:06:21 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Also, a note on naming - my algorithm is as follows</p><p>1) find a temperament<br/>2) listen to it and see what it sounds like - what does it remind me<br/>of? have fun with it<br/>3) try to find some suitable geologic name that relates to it<br/>4) If we&apos;re mixing temperaments with existing ones, like mixing<br/>oceanfront with porcupine, harmonize them somehow - I went with<br/>&quot;porcupinefish,&quot; which is an actual species of fish</p><p>The above is just how I&apos;m doing things, feel free to be creative and<br/>have fun with it. Igs had a good idea as well with the list of the<br/>standard biomes, so maybe we can work those in too as &quot;clans&quot; or<br/>something.</p><p>-Mike</p><p>On Sun, Apr 24, 2011 at 9:02 PM, Mike Battaglia &lt;battaglia01@...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt; Hi all,<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I did some initial work on setting up a 91/90.

In general, it just means that the<br/>utonal version of 6:7:9 becomes 10:13:15. So 9/7 becomes 13/10 and 7/6<br/>becomes 15/13. I&apos;ve decided it&apos;s the most useful comma of all time.</p><p>&gt; Oh, hey, maybe 23&apos;s &quot;dicot&quot;-like scale is a good candidate: it&apos;s got lots of both otonal and utonal 8:13:15 triads. Generator of about 365 cents, a 16/13 perhaps...maybe you can work out the commas involved there?</p><p>It might make more sense to think of the generator as 13/8. If the<br/>generator&apos;s 13/8, that means we&apos;re out of the <a href="http://2.3.7.13/5">2.3.7.13/5</a> subgroup, as<br/>in that subgroup there is no 13, just a 13/5. So we&apos;d have to be in<br/>2.3.5.7.13 then. Tempering 91/90 brings us to rank 4, and we have two<br/>more commas to go before we get to rank 2.</p><p>Three 16/13&apos;s is equated with 15/8, meaning that 32955/32768 vanishes<br/>- one more to go. Five generators gets you to 7/6, but that just turns<br/>out to mean that 91/90 vanishes. One more generator gets you to 10/7,<br/>which means 196/195 vanishes.</p><p>The result is here:</p><p><a href="http://x31eq.com/cgi-bin/rt.cgi?ets=46_10&limit=2.3.5.7.13">http://x31eq.com/cgi-bin/rt.cgi?ets=46_10&limit=2.3.5.7.13</a></p><p>Well, seems that something we did caused the period to split in two,<br/>so this isn&apos;t quite the scale you were talking about, but it&apos;s<br/>obviously related. The 10-note from this MOS is</p><p> 129.825<br/> 259.649<br/> 364.912<br/> 494.737<br/> 600.000<br/> 729.825<br/> 859.649<br/> 964.912<br/>1094.737<br/>1200.000</p><p>As you can see it has 7/4 in it. As a last note, if you want to bring<br/>the full 11-limit into it, looks like a good way to do things is<br/>&quot;Echidnic&quot; temperament:</p><p><a href="http://x31eq.com/cgi-bin/rt.cgi?ets=10_46&limit=13&key=3_-6_-1_10_1_2_2_7_6_3_7&error=9.374">http://x31eq.com/cgi-bin/rt.cgi?ets=10_46&limit=13&key=3_-6_-1_10_1_2_2_7_6_3_7&error=9.374</a></p><p>Or, it could just be that this really is the temperament you were<br/>talking about, but that each temperament just defines more than one<br/>MOS, which is another salient point I&apos;ve been meaning to address for a<br/>while now.</p><p>-Mike</p></div>
