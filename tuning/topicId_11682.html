I particular, I have been having a lot of fun with<br/>&gt; the Centaur tuning described at Anaphoria<br/>(<a href="http://www.anaphoria.com/centaur.html">www.anaphoria.com/centaur.html</a>).<br/>&gt; It has a lot of interesting resources and I find manageable for a<br/>&gt; beginner to start with.  I find the collection of major, minor and<br/>&gt; septimal minor triads particularly intriguing.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;         While playing around with this tuning I noticed that I was<br/>&gt; doing something that should have made my toes curl, at least by all<br/>&gt; reports: I was playing this as a chord: 9/8 7/5 5/3.  This looks like<br/>&gt; DF#A using the mapping from the web page.  My fingers were thinking<br/>&gt; &quot;major.&quot;  Overtone series: 84:100:135.  The interval from 9/8 to 5/3<br/>&gt; is the much maligned wolf fifth, 40:27.  The 40:27 interval sounded<br/>&gt; like a fine member of the Major family to me combined with the 7/5,<br/>&gt; though the beating from just the 40:27 is not quite nice.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;         Now this is no surprise that the addition of the 7/5 would<br/>&gt; improve the overall sensation of consonance, I thought, until I<br/>&gt; checked the intervocalic ratios: 56:45, 25:21.  Now, 25:21 is only two<br/>&gt; cents off (301.85) a tempered minor third, but 56:45 is well away from<br/>&gt; anything at 378.6 cents (5/4 is 386.31).  I&apos;ve checked the tuning of<br/>&gt; the synth several times in desperation.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;         Why in the world didn&apos;t this chord shriek at me?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;         I don&apos;t have an answer to that.  I listen to a lot of<br/>&gt; obnoxious electronic music with a fondness for fairly brilliant - not<br/>&gt; to say discordant - timbres, which may have left me with an<br/>&gt; appreciation, somehow, for a chord like 84:100:135.  However, I did<br/>&gt; start to wonder about ways of characterizing a chords &quot;distance&quot; from<br/>&gt; some other chord, such that one can say &quot;nope, these are too far apart<br/>&gt; to be misconstrued for each other?&quot;  I grabbed &quot;Divisions of the<br/>&gt; Tetrachord&quot; and read through chapter 5 a few times.  There are lots of<br/>&gt; interesting tables there, but I&apos;m not quite sure comparing tetrachords<br/>&gt; and comparing chords are the same thing.  Has anyone done any work on<br/>&gt; this?  I&apos;d rather not rediscover work already done. :)<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; * Reaktor.  At the risk of sounding like a marketing person for<br/>&gt; <a href="http://www.native-instruments.de">www.native-instruments.de</a>, I must say that Reaktor is one of the most<br/>&gt; wonderful software synthesizers I have ever seen.  It is in fact a<br/>&gt; system for *building* synths and samplers.  This flexibility has<br/>&gt; allowed me to add a bunch of retuning knobs to every &quot;ensemble&quot; (a<br/>&gt; working collection of sound modules) I find I like.  It makes playing<br/>&gt; with tuning a joy, though my neighbors may not agree. :)<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; --<br/>&gt; William S.
