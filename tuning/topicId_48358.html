Kraig Grady seems to think so too, but rather than campaign<br/>for<br/>a change in the contemporary musical landscape, Grady simply invented<br/>his<br/>own. As liaison for the Isle of Anaphoria, a sort of ideal Indonesian<br/>atoll<br/>apparently populated by an anarcho-syndicalist collective of artists,<br/>theater people, experimental musicians and ethnomusicologists, Grady has</p><p>overseen the dissemination of Anaphorian culture in the L.A. area for<br/>just<br/>over a decade. This has entailed a broad range of activities including<br/>performances and recordings of Anaphoria&iuml;&iquest;&half;s droning or percussive<br/>traditional<br/>music, the voluminous and endlessly fascinating Web site at<br/><a href="http://www.anaphoria.com">www.anaphoria.com</a>, and, most recently, a series of shadow plays<br/>reenacting<br/>Anaphorian mythology.</p><p>As a fan of both microtonal music (where instead of 12 tones in an<br/>octave<br/>you have 24, or 96, or 666 or, if I understand correctly in this case,<br/>12<br/>slightly different tones) and imaginative narrative umbrellas that<br/>collect<br/>wide-ranging art practices &iuml;&iquest;&half; la the Museum of Jurassic Technology, I was</p><p>well-prepared to enjoy Frenzy at the Royal Threshold at the Norton Simon</p><p>October 24. The music was amazing, particularly the deep ringing notes<br/>of<br/>the enormous xylophonelike Mt. Mesa instruments &iuml;&iquest;&half; only the most<br/>impressive<br/>of the homemade instruments used in the performance. It was hard to<br/>believe<br/>that the complex music &iuml;&iquest;&half; emerging from behind the backlit scrim &iuml;&iquest;&half; was<br/>live,<br/>partly improvised, without electronic amplification, and performed by<br/>the<br/>same people handling the puppets backstage. The visuals were almost as<br/>impressive, ranging from cut-out puppets similar to the familiar ancient</p><p>Indonesian variety to swirling optical effects suited to psychedelic<br/>light<br/>shows of the &iuml;&iquest;&half;60s. The narrative &iuml;&iquest;&half; a sweet mishmash of the kinds of<br/>Hindu<br/>love stories Joseph Campbell was always spewing &iuml;&iquest;&half; was a little fuzzy in<br/>spots, but the fact that much of the dialogue was ad-libbed gave the<br/>performance a thrilling improvisational edge.</p><p>Afterward, the performers emerged from behind the screen lugging<br/>puppets,<br/>some instruments and even one of the patched-together light boxes.<br/>Frenzy<br/>finally won me over by the fact that it was so strongly reminiscent of<br/>the<br/>kind of theater that I encountered in public school in the 1970s &iuml;&iquest;&half;<br/>grant-funded multicultural puppetry performed by DIY hippies that was<br/>far<br/>stranger than it seemed at the time. It&iuml;&iquest;&half;s a form that deserves reviving,<br/>and<br/>the Shadow Theater of Anaphoria has nailed it &iuml;&iquest;&half; right down to the<br/>informal<br/>Q&amp;A. The oddest thing is that they only do these performances<br/>occasionally<br/>and seldom repeat material. The next one&iuml;&iquest;&half;s set for the Pacific Asia<br/>Museum<br/>in May.
