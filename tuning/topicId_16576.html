I&apos;ve always loved ring modulation, although<br/>I&apos;ve never had a stand alone stomp-box. One of the most masterful<br/>performers I&apos;ve seen use one is John McLaughlin, who I saw a few<br/>years back with Dennis Chambers (one unbelievable MOTORCYCLE!!!!) and<br/>Joey DeFrancesco (12 tET or not, this guy is a freaking Gold Plated<br/>Harley too!!!). Anyway McLaughlin made extremely tasteful use of this<br/>during the show.</p><p>Back in the days when my old partner Duke and I used to do this sort<br/>of Fred Frith (Guitars on Table)/Derek Bailey inspired free form<br/>improv music, we would achieve myriad of unusual sounds by<br/>using &quot;Prepared Guitars&quot;, in which there would be various kinds of<br/>objects shoved in, or interwoven between the strings - such as paper<br/>clips, cord, rubber stoppers or paper strips - and then stroked or<br/>tortured with various implements (drum sticks, acrylic rod slide,<br/>hair brush - whatever). I even had some wind up toys that could be<br/>laid on the neck, which would contort and strain when lodged between<br/>the strings (These toys were a real riot in live performance too!<br/>Especially my Godzilla wind-up, which exuded sparks from its mouth.<br/>Folks would laugh uncontrollably, which was ok for my kind of show.).<br/>It was really a rich time of exploring &quot;extended&quot; techniques for the<br/>guitar, and it became such an ingrained vocabulary, that I could<br/>easily do it today. Some of the most compelling sounds you could get<br/>were with a simple paper clip interwoven twixt the strings - and<br/>moved to harmonic &quot;sweet spots&quot;, giving a sound very similar to a<br/>gong. Also pouring stuff on guitars to get random effects was a<br/>common technique I recall.</p><p>I went to the David Canright site and was most impressed. David is<br/>indeed one industrious fellow. My word! A 38 tones to the 2/1<br/>fretting!! About made my heart stop! As I read further I saw some<br/>things that I felt would be more feasible for me. Looks like a<br/>standard guitar tuning would be out the window.</p><p>I would like to explore this. Especially armed with the knowledge of<br/>someone who&apos;s already been there like yourself and David. I can see<br/>that this is going to take some planning, and I would like to as a<br/>side project for myself, come up with a way to analyze the<br/>possibilities before I commit to stringing the guitar with a non-<br/>standard stringing.</p><p>Thanks kindly,</p><p>Jacky Ligon</p></div><h3><a id=16582 href="#16582">ðŸ”—</a>Paul H.

So for JI that&apos;s more JI than meantone, standard tuning is out the<br/>window. JI guitar meister Jon Catler uses &quot;standard tuning&quot; but with a 27:20<br/>interval between his D and G strings (and tunes his B to the 60-cycle hum).</p><p>Thanks for sharing your &quot;prepared guitar&quot; experiences too . . . that was<br/>fun!</p></div><h3><a id=16583 href="#16583">ðŸ”—</a>ligonj@northstate.net</h3><span>12/14/2000 4:32:17 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@egroups.com">tuning@egroups.com</a>, &quot;Paul H.

I don&apos;t remember where I found the<br/>circuit, but I built a diode-bridge ring modulator way back then. I had<br/>(still have, actually :-) a sine and square wave signal generator. That went<br/>into one side of the ring modulator, and sounds recorded directly off the<br/>speakers of a computer went into the other side. I didn&apos;t have any filters,<br/>though. Most everything else I did with two dual-speed (3.75 ips and 7.5<br/>ips) tape recorders, one of which could be configured as an echo generator.</p><p>So what is happening here? Are contemporary musicians and composers<br/>re-discovering the limited and finicky tools of the past (musique concrete,<br/>analog componentry, etc.) and ignoring the wondrous digital technologies<br/>that I could only dream about back in those days when I was a poor graduate<br/>student? I can understand it in the case of Bob Moog; one of his articles on<br/>theremin construction that I saw on the web dates back to 1954, about five<br/>years before I discovered electronic music in the form of Alwin Nikolai&apos;s<br/>work. But my dreams were always of digital music -- tools like CSound/SAOL,<br/>CDP, the WX5 and VL70-m and so forth. What a difference five years can make!</p><p>&gt; Bostonian Scott Dakota, who does the engineering and mixing on my<br/>&gt; stuff, is really into making and modifying his own effects. One of<br/>&gt; these was a frightfully temperamental ring modulator that he rigged up<br/>&gt; out of a Boss auto-pan stomp box... we used that one a lot!</p><p>There&apos;s an interesting parallel here with some of the theory of chaos and<br/>artificial life.
