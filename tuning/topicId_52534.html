I&apos;m bored so here&apos;s some actual tuning material to<br/>hopefully spur some discussion (or better yet, music) on this<br/>list . . .</p><p>Carl noticed on tuning-math that there are 12 tuning systems Gene and<br/>I both included in our lists of best (simple &amp; accurate) 7-<br/>limit &apos;linear&apos; temperaments. I&apos;ve constructed horagrams (&apos;clock<br/>diagrams&apos; with concentric rings representing &apos;distributionally even&apos;<br/>scales) for these under the assumption that octave-repetition is used<br/>(but that these octaves are tempered). I&apos;d love to hear diverse<br/>opinions on how to notate these. Unfortunately, Dave Keenan and<br/>George Secor have left, but hopefully Mark Gould, Carl Lumma, and<br/>some newbies and oldbies would like to offer ideas and/or<br/>questions . . . Even more, I&apos;d love to hear music in any of these<br/>systems. Joseph Pehrson has composed a bit in Blackjack, etc. but a<br/>few of these tuning systems are unexplored territory . . .</p><p>I mention the 4:5:6:7 chord but these tuning systems are designed to<br/>represent the entire 7-prime-limit, so all kinds of other chords can<br/>and should be used as well.</p><p>Three of the tuning systems are fairly familiar. The simplest is<br/>called &apos;dominant sevenths&apos;:<br/><a href="/tuning/files/perlich/domsev.gif">/tuning/files/perlich/domsev.gif</a><br/>as it forms a familiar chain of fifths and approximates 4:5:6:7 with<br/>a dominant seventh chord formed from this chain. As Kalle pointed<br/>out, this is suitable for a static form of tonality based on the<br/>mixolydian (and possibly dorian, with a m6 chord as tonic) mode. It<br/>seems most likely that one would use conventional 7-letter notation<br/>for this, and the rough 4:5:6:7 chords would be notated as D-F#-A-C,<br/>C-E-G-Bb, etc. The first ring in the horagram which contains any of<br/>these chords is the 7-note ring, which has one (since the diatonic<br/>scale has one dominant seventh chord); the 12-note ring has six.</p><p>Then we have meantone:<br/><a href="/tuning/files/perlich/meantone.gif">/tuning/files/perlich/meantone.gif</a><br/>with the 4:5:6:7 approximated by a German augmented sixth chord -- an<br/>idea that may have originated with Huygens. One would probably stick<br/>with conventional notation, and 4:5:6:7s occur as D-F#-A-B#, C-E-G-<br/>A#, Ab-C-Eb-F#, etc. The first ring in the horagram which contains<br/>any of these chords is the 12-note ring, which has two (since a 12-<br/>note meantone chromatic has two augmented sixth chords).</p><p>The most accurate of the familiar three is called &apos;schismatic&apos;,<br/>or &apos;schismic&apos; by Graham:<br/><a href="/tuning/files/perlich/schi7.gif">/tuning/files/perlich/schi7.gif</a><br/>It&apos;s formed like Pythagorean tuning, but optimally the fifth and<br/>octave are both stretched by less than 1 cent. Again, conventional 7-<br/>letter notation seems ideal, but here the 4:5:6:7 is obtained with D-<br/>Gb-A-Dbb, C-Fb-G-Cbb, D#-G-A#-Db, etc. Though there&apos;s a 12-note ring<br/>present, the first ring in the horagram which contains any of these<br/>chords is the 17-note ring, which has three. I believe Margo Schulter<br/>has discussed this arragement, though she tends to use 24 notes for<br/>most of her tuning systems.</p><p>The other 9 systems have a generator that is not a perfect fifth<br/>(fourth) and/or a period that is not an octave, so they&apos;re more<br/>unconventional.</p><p>The system I essentially wrote the following paper on:<br/><a href="http://lumma.org/tuning/erlich/erlich-decatonic.pdf">http://lumma.org/tuning/erlich/erlich-decatonic.pdf</a><br/>is now called Pajara:<br/><a href="/tuning/files/perlich/pajar.gif">/tuning/files/perlich/pajar.gif</a><br/>since Paul used to torture his friends Jeff and Ara with endless<br/>fantasies on keyboard tuned with this arrangement. The paper suggests<br/>using the digits 1-9 and 0 as a notation for the 10-note ring (which<br/>contains four of the approximate 4:5:6:7 chords, while the 12-note<br/>ring contains six), and little triangles for &quot;chromatic&quot; alterations.<br/>Earlier, I had used the letters P through Y for notation, and this<br/>might be preferable because numbers mean so many things already that<br/>confusion tends to arise when they are also used for note names.</p><p>The paper also hints at another system that I now call Injera:<br/><a href="/tuning/files/perlich/injera.gif">/tuning/files/perlich/injera.gif</a><br/>The 14-note ring mentioned is in the paper has six approximate<br/>4:5:6:7s, while the 12-note ring has four.</p><p>Reflecting some 20th century usages of 12-equal, but tuned more<br/>specifically, are the augmented system:<br/><a href="/tuning/files/perlich/aug7.gif">/tuning/files/perlich/aug7.gif</a><br/>which has three rough 4:5:6:7 chords in the 9-note ring, and six in<br/>the 12-note ring;<br/>and the diminished system:<br/><a href="/tuning/files/perlich/dimsev.gif">/tuning/files/perlich/dimsev.gif</a><br/>which has four rough 4:5:6:7 chords in the 8-note ring, and eight in<br/>the 12-note ring.</p><p>The other 5 systems have no 12-note ring, so are the most exotic.</p><p>Firstly, a system that should be familiar to many on this list (there<br/>were thousands of messages on it in 2001, before anyone noticed<br/>George Secor discovered it in 1975) is called Miracle:<br/><a href="/tuning/files/perlich/">/tuning/files/perlich/</a><br/>It&apos;s the most accurate of these 12 systems. Graham has suggested<br/>notating the 10-note ring with the digits 0-9, and using the symbols<br/>^ and v to get the 21-note &quot;chromatic&quot; scale, called Blackjack, which<br/>contains eight near-just 4:5:6:7 chords.</p><p>The least accurate is called Blackwood, since Easley B. used and<br/>discussed the 10-note ring (though he tuned it in 15-equal):<br/><a href="/tuning/files/perlich/miracle.gif">/tuning/files/perlich/miracle.gif</a><br/>The 10-note ring contains five rough 4:5:6:7 chords, and the 15-note<br/>ring, ten.</p><p>Graham Breed came up with the name Magic for this:<br/><a href="/tuning/files/perlich/magic.gif">/tuning/files/perlich/magic.gif</a><br/>The 19-note ring has seven approximate 4:5:6:7 chords; as always, a<br/>ring with N fewer (more) notes will have N fewer (more) 4:5:6:7<br/>chords (until the number would drop below zero), so for example the<br/>13-note ring has only one approximate 4:5:6:7 chord.</p><p>Gene Ward Smith came up with the name Orwell for this:<br/><a href="/tuning/files/perlich/orwell.gif">/tuning/files/perlich/orwell.gif</a><br/>The 13-note ring has two approximate 4:5:6:7 chords; the 22-note ring<br/>has eleven.</p><p>Last but certainly not least, there&apos;s the little-known &apos;Semisixths&apos;<br/>(since its generator is about half of a major sixth) system:<br/><a href="/tuning/files/perlich/semisixths.gif">/tuning/files/perlich/semisixths.gif</a><br/>Here the 19-note ring contains six approximate 4:5:6:7 chords.</p></div><h3><a id=52538 href="#52538">ðŸ”—</a>Joseph Pehrson &#x3C;jpehrson@rcn.com&#x3E;</h3><span>2/17/2004 5:43:01 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;wallyesterpaulrus&quot; &lt;paul@s...&gt; wrote:</p><p><a href="/tuning/topicId_52534.html#52534">/tuning/topicId_52534.html#52534</a></p><p>&gt; Hi everyone . . .

But it might make more sense to label the notes of the 9-note scale from A to I (A F B G C H D I E in order of pitch), and use an accidental for the small step between J and A. With that scheme, the 14-note scale would be A F Bb B G Cb C H Db D I Eb E Ab. This scheme for naming notes is easily adaptable to other linear temperaments, even highly warped ones, but might be best reserved for those (like superpelog) that don&apos;t easily map to traditional notation. It&apos;s useful for keeping track of the notes in Cakewalk piano rolls and event lists, at any rate.</p><p>&gt; The paper also hints at another system that I now call Injera:<br/>&gt; <a href="/tuning/files/perlich/injera.gif">/tuning/files/perlich/injera.gif</a> &gt; The 14-note ring mentioned is in the paper has six approximate &gt; 4:5:6:7s, while the 12-note ring has four.</p><p>Naming every note of Injera[12] seems like the logical thing to do, but that&apos;s a lot of notes. The thing is that there&apos;s a large number of steps all the same size, without any smaller steps. Since it&apos;s a 12-note scale, standard notation might be the most convenient, reserving Cb and E# for the extra two notes of Injera[14].</p><p>&gt; The least accurate is called Blackwood, since Easley B. used and &gt; discussed the 10-note ring (though he tuned it in 15-equal):<br/>&gt; <a href="/tuning/files/perlich/miracle.gif">/tuning/files/perlich/miracle.gif</a> &gt; The 10-note ring contains five rough 4:5:6:7 chords, and the 15-note &gt; ring, ten.</p><p>For scales with 5 or more periods in the octave, probably the most reasonable thing to do is notate the periods and use accidentals for the generator.</p><p>&gt; Graham Breed came up with the name Magic for this:<br/>&gt; <a href="/tuning/files/perlich/magic.gif">/tuning/files/perlich/magic.gif</a> &gt; The 19-note ring has seven approximate 4:5:6:7 chords; as always, a &gt; ring with N fewer (more) notes will have N fewer (more) 4:5:6:7 &gt; chords (until the number would drop below zero), so for example the &gt; 13-note ring has only one approximate 4:5:6:7 chord.</p><p>Another scale with lots of identically-sized steps and no smaller ones until you get to Magic[22].

Then the next iterator of the generator after I gives you A#, and so on. For the 13-note ring, you have A A# F B B# G C C# H D D# I E. The 22-note ring gets into double sharps, or you could take the generator downwards from A to add flats: A A# Fb F Bb B B# Gb G Cb C C# Hb H Db D D# Ib I Eb E Ab.
