One can learn to write excellent songs and and short pieces still not have the knack for writing symphonies; you just need to look at the &nbsp;Romantic repertory for confirmation of this statement--the entire repertory, not just the famous names who did master symphonic writing.<br/>On the other hand, throughout most of human history, and in most cultures, humans have .been listening to and making music that made sense to them without using the tools of common-practice harmony. &nbsp;<br/>Franklin</p><p>Dr. Franklin Cox</p><p>1107 Xenia Ave.</p><p>Yellow Springs, OH 45387</p><p>(937) 767-1165</p><p>franklincox@...</p><p>--- On Sun, 2/21/10, Chris &lt;chrisvaisvil@...&gt; wrote:</p><p>From: Chris &lt;chrisvaisvil@...&gt;<br/>Subject: Re: [tuning] Music Cognition (Audiences hate modern classical music because ... )<br/>To: <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a><br/>Date: Sunday, February 21, 2010, 6:31 PM</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Perhaps you can write these questions to the reseacher.
