In the keyboard music of the<br/>early 15th century, and in Dave Hill&apos;s performances of the Blues on<br/>meantone piano, these &quot;odd&quot; intervals come out and take center stage.</p><p>Having presented the syntonic comma of the medieval Pythagorena tuning<br/>as a musically positive &quot;feature&quot; (active thirds and sixths), I might<br/>add that various features discovered by users in software, this one<br/>wasn&apos;t necessarily included by design.</p><p>Pythagorean tuning focuses on pure 3:2 fifths and 4:3 fourths, and<br/>meantone likewise on pure or near-pure thirds (5:4 and 6:5) and sixths<br/>(5:3 and 8:5). It just so happens that Pythagorean produces the active<br/>Pythagorean thirds and sixths so effectively used in Gothic music, and<br/>that meantone likewise produces the rather tense minor sevenths<br/>fitting the Renaissance and Manneristic styles. At yet another level,<br/>it happens that the same systems also produce almost optimally smooth<br/>near-5:4 schisma thirds or near-7:4 &quot;meantone diesis sevenths.&quot;</p><p>Maybe I should reply to your well-taken question about medieval<br/>sources from conclusions about tuning by saying that I regard both the<br/>music itself and the treatises as vital guideposts in reaching<br/>conclusions, and that both practice and theory require interpretation,<br/>which inevitably implies taking a viewpoint.</p><p>Authors such as Marchettus of Padua in 1318, and Prosdocimus of<br/>Beldemandis and Ugolino of Orvieto in the early 15th century, do<br/>discuss such points as cadential aesthetics: the idea, for example,<br/>that major thirds and sixths should expand to stable fifths and<br/>octaves using narrow semitones (for Marchettus, evidently, even<br/>narrower than conventional Pythagorean). When such texts are placed<br/>in the context of actual 14th-century music, and the music also placed<br/>placed in the setting of such intonational ideals, a better artistic<br/>understanding may emerge.</p><p>Similarly, Mark Lindley has impressively drawn connections between theory<br/>and music during the era of around 1380-1450 to show a shift in aesthetics<br/>first toward a deliberate use of schisma thirds as a &quot;special effect,&quot; and<br/>then toward the adoption of meantone tuning as a solution for making such<br/>smooth thirds an intonational norm.</p><p>Most appreciatively,</p><p>Margo Schulter<br/><a href="mailto:mschulter@value.net">mschulter@value.net</a></p></div>
