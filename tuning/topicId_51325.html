It has nothing to do with conservatism, though your idea of what is acceptable in transcription appears to be *anything*.</p><p>&gt; Nor do I much care for<br/>&gt; your condescending sneer to the effect that nothing worthwhile has<br/>&gt; been done, but you are still hoping.</p><p>I did not say that, and I look forward to music made with many of the developments you&apos;ve taken part in. Especially new music.</p><p>&gt; I don&apos;t want petty comments about how many decimal places I use,<br/>&gt; whether or not I can mention Harry Partch, or if people who use oboes<br/>&gt; in the place of violins are ignorant boobs.</p><p>Take a chill pill. I said neither of the first two, and the last is way overstated, as I&apos;ve answered above. Every time you bring up Partch, which I didn&apos;t, shows an innate hostility to me. I should have learned, but you&apos;d rather not have my comments on things. Fine.</p><p>&gt; In general I don&apos;t want<br/>&gt; conservatism for its own knee-jerk sake. I do value your comment on<br/>&gt; the octaves of top meantone--obviously, they bother you, and this is<br/>&gt; a data point, and the kind of feedback we need.</p><p>No musical opinions on music then. Fine.</p><p>&gt; No. Ultraconservatism again!</p><p>That&apos;s a laugh.</p><p>&gt; Bad analogy. Night on Porcupine Mountain is a translation, but top<br/>&gt; meantone is merely a tuning</p><p>*Merely*? Does this mean that a tuning cannot ruin (or save) a piece? Or, as you constantly say, &quot;works for me&quot;?</p><p>&gt; &gt; I don&apos;t care what the measurement is: the *music* was written for<br/>&gt; notes that are in tune, and you&apos;ve negated that.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Good Lord. How can you hang out on the tuning list all this time and<br/>&gt; say this? It was *not* written for &quot;notes that are in tune&quot;</p><p>So you are saying that quartets, no matter what the time period (going all the way back to Haydn&apos;s original concerts) would have played those octaves with beats and not given it a second thought? Or are you saying that *that* particular piece survives octave beating just fine?</p><p>&gt; they were not adapting it<br/>&gt; to the approved tuning of the San Diego Symphony Orchestra.</p><p>You don&apos;t need to keep bringing up the SDS, since it isn&apos;t germain. Not to mention you&apos;ve probably never heard the orchestra, which is not as good as SFO, etc.</p><p>&gt; I was excited because I had a positive, wow!, reaction to the octave<br/>&gt; stretching coupled with sweet sounding triads. The oboes were<br/>&gt; supposed to bring out that dynamic.</p><p>You might have said as much.</p><p>&gt; &gt; What does precision have to do with making music?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; First you tell me that top meantone is garbage</p><p>I did not. Is it impossible for you to respond without completely mis-stating my positions?</p><p>&gt; Haydn never used a computer to render music in his life. If he did,<br/>&gt; how do you know he&apos;d prefer the violin sound font over the oboe?</p><p>I don&apos;t. But you continue to ignore my only objection to it, which *wasn&apos;t* based on history, so it is moot.</p><p>&gt; You dumped on me very, very hard over the oboe business. It went<br/>&gt; way beyond a bad review. It was practically moral condemnation,<br/>&gt; like and<br/>&gt; old-time preacher on cards and dancing.</p><p>What??? I think it is a poor choice, if taking string ensemble music in a new tuning AND at the same time altering the orchestration. Beyond that, I guess I figured you had a lot thicker skin than that, Gene, and it basically *does* mean that you don&apos;t want any disagreements, other than &quot;data points&quot;.</p><p>&gt; That&apos;s one opinion. Here&apos;s another--oboes are good for checking out<br/>&gt; tunings, because they are rich in harmonics. So are violins, but<br/>&gt; oboes really punch it.</p><p>Then why wasn&apos;t it an oboe quartet?</p><p>&gt; Anyway, I didn&apos;t do an experiment. If you want experiments, buy a<br/>&gt; chemistry set.</p><p>Haha. Very clever. It was a total experiment, Gene.</p><p>&gt; If I boil this down, it seems to be an argument from authority saying<br/>&gt; that we should always do what Grandpa did.</p><p>You stopped listening a long time ago...</p><p>&gt; No change. No thought. No no never anything which resembles<br/>&gt; progress.</p><p>And your response is to root through the compositions of the past, suck them into your computer, apply samples and tunings to them and come out the other end as The Next Great Thing.</p><p>No, I don&apos;t think you feel that way, but all I view in these tuning experiments is potential gleanings of music that might be composed. And it seems that 99% of the activity around this community is unconcerned with creating NEW music. That would be progress and change.</p><p>&gt; Your 30+ years means that your musical taste is better than mine?<br/>&gt; It doesn&apos;t work that way. Musicians can have rotten taste in music.</p><p>You&apos;ve got it easy, Gene. You don&apos;t have to ever once admit a musical fallacy, because anything outside of a spreadsheet is simply a matter of taste.</p><p>Real easy.</p><p>Cheers,<br/>Jon</p></div><h3><a id=51444 href="#51444">ðŸ”—</a>Jon Szanto &#x3C;JSZANTO@ADNC.COM&#x3E;</h3><span>1/10/2004 9:03:59 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;Gene Ward Smith&quot; &lt;gwsmith@s...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt; However, you don&apos;t need very much experience to know a soundfont<br/>&gt; for an instrument is not the same as the instrument.</p><p>No kidding.</p><p>&gt; In the vastness of your wisdom and your massive<br/>&gt; 30+ years of experience, have you pondered how well string<br/>&gt; soundfonts render string quartet music?</p><p>Your anger still causes you to miss my point.

Your comment<br/>that I do too much of this is typical. What makes it your damned<br/>business?</p><p>Some of these I don&apos;t like and dump.

I hope everyone (including moderators) moderates<br/>themselves as a poster.  When doing &quot;ordinary&quot; posting I would expect a<br/>moderator to behave exactly how they would have behaved not being a<br/>moderator.</p><p>If we want moderators to follow higher standards as posters than everyone<br/>else maybe that is a good thing, but then we should somehow have an<br/>agreement to that effect.  The best way to implement this might be for each<br/>moderator to state their policies regarding their own behavior as ordinary<br/>posters, and to ask others whether that is acceptable, and if the consensus<br/>is no, then they can resign as moderator.  Otherwise criticising a<br/>moderator&apos;s ordinary postings on the basis of a presumed value judgement due<br/>to their also being a moderator is of less value, as I see it, but of course<br/>still valid as a personal opinion.</p><p>My preference is this:  please criticize a moderators post by exactly the<br/>same standards as any other person&apos;s post.  If moderators can be expected to<br/>be impeccable in their personal posting policies (nice alliteration) then<br/>the same should be expected of everyone else.  And thus I don&apos;t *expect* it,<br/>but hope for it, and will feel free to offer feedback toward that end, to<br/>moderators postings the same as for everyone else.</p><p>Opinion:  I can see how it happenned between Gene and Jon.  I can see that<br/>as an almost inevitable consequence of their individual propensities.

In looking at what Gene apparently<br/>heard in Jon I could get a tentative sense of what hit Gene the wrong way,<br/>i.e that Jon might have been slightly off-hand or less than careful, but<br/>even more to the point I suspect Jon is not fully aware of the differences<br/>of communication styles that exist between the culture *he* is used to from<br/>what some others may be used to.  I also think Jon has more fire than Gene,<br/>and by habit, less of a damper.  And I also do not think it is Jon&apos;s<br/>exclusive responsibility to be aware of any of that.  Rather if we have any<br/>difficulties with the communication it is our responsibility to elucidate<br/>this.  To attack back when we perceive we are being attacked does not help.<br/>So I&apos;d say if you feel attacked (or insulted, or whatever) and you give the<br/>person back what you believe they &quot;deserve&quot; you have just put yourself in a<br/>position of not learning anything.  Then, having received what he &quot;deserves&quot;<br/>you have just invited the other person to join you in not really learning<br/>anything.</p><p>It is a rare day when, after being attacked, someone reflects deeply and<br/>then apologises.  The missing ingredient in that description is the<br/>difference between &quot;being attacked&quot; which sounds to be objective, and<br/>&quot;feeling attacked&quot; or something to that effect which acknowledges more<br/>possibility.  Until someone can acknowledge that there is a difference<br/>between what they experienced of someone&apos;s action and that person&apos;s own<br/>experience of what they did, then the potential for someone learning<br/>something (and therefore the potential for resolution) is pretty much locked<br/>out.</p><p>I have *never* seen a situation in which both sides did not have something<br/>to learn.  I think neither Gene nor Jon fully acknowledged such a<br/>possibility.  If you want to help someone learn something *with* you it<br/>takes an entirely different approach to have something like success.  I<br/>think many or even most people have never seen such success, because their<br/>pride has never allowed it.  So let&apos;s all try something different because<br/>what we have tried so far did not work.</p><p>Sometimes after a fight people feel relieved and come back and &quot;kiss and<br/>make up&quot;, but this does not happen so much whan a friendship was not already<br/>established.  Either way the memory of all the pain that was created in the<br/>relationship makes it much harder to heal and much more unconfortable to<br/>continue since every moment with the person feels like a reminder of pain.<br/>It is much easier if the cycle is stopped before it is started.  Better late<br/>than never, but it takes much more courage to endure a relationship after a<br/>battle than if there had been no battle at all.  However everyone involved<br/>still has the choice of whether to continue to make it worse or not, and it<br/>is really fruitful practice to go through something difficult willingly.</p><p>That&apos;s just a perspective, just my take on it *today* based on my *memory*<br/>of the interaction, and it is always my intention to avoid pretending to be<br/>authorative about anything, so if you believe I have missed the mark please<br/>let me know.</p><p>-Kurt</p></div><h3><a id=51609 href="#51609">ðŸ”—</a>Gene Ward Smith &#x3C;gwsmith@svpal.org&#x3E;</h3><span>1/11/2004 7:50:09 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;Joseph Pehrson&quot; &lt;jpehrson@r...&gt; wrote:</p><p>&gt; ***I&apos;m sure there would be plenty of people around here who<br/>&gt; would &quot;moderate...&quot;  I wouldn&apos;t mind it myself, except I wouldn&apos;t<br/>do<br/>&gt; much except maybe delete pornography...</p><p>Carl and I have been attacked for not doing more than that.</p></div><h3><a id=51610 href="#51610">ðŸ”—</a>Gene Ward Smith &#x3C;gwsmith@svpal.org&#x3E;</h3><span>1/11/2004 8:01:28 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;wallyesterpaulrus&quot; &lt;paul@s...&gt; wrote:</p><p>&gt; I think Jon&apos;s experience makes his hunch count for an awful lot<br/>here.<br/>&gt; It&apos;s pretty well accepted among experienced orchestrators that<br/>&gt; consonance *within* instrumental groups is more important than<br/>&gt; consonance *between* instrumental groups, for example -- though<br/>&gt; that&apos;s not really the issue here . . .</p><p>More important for what?
