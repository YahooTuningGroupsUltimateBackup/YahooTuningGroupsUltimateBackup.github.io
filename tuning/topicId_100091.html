Of course, this is cheating, and will lead to vile, impure,<br/>sinful music, so don&apos;t do it.</p><p>-Mike</p></div><h3>cityoftheasleep &#x3C;igliashon@...&#x3E;</h3><span>6/15/2011 11:20:48 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Try Negri[10], perhaps in 19-EDO: 2 2 2 2 1 2 2 2 2 2.  I think you will find it is indeed subtly arabic, but also with a good complement of consonant chords and some xenharmonic intervals (subminor 3rd, supermajor 6th, and a quartertone-ish interval.  It&apos;s got more minor 2nds than you could shake a stick at, plenty of perfect 4ths and 5ths, but with some subtly unusual shadings.</p><p>-Igs</p><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;sevishmusic&quot; &lt;sevish@...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Hello all,<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I&apos;m looking for a diatonic scale, something subtly Arabic or with a mood to that effect.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Must contain a minor second, perfect fourth and perfect fifth.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; It&apos;s for a short film and it would be great to get some microtones in there.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Thanks,<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Sean<br/>&gt;</p></div><h3>sevishmusic &#x3C;sevish@...&#x3E;</h3><span>6/16/2011 8:14:06 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Thanks for the ideas all.
