A little less realistic, but still<br/>identifiable.</p><p>Why? Because the realtive loudnesses of the partials, the amplitude<br/>envelopes for the various partials over time, and the additional noise<br/>contained in the tone, are very different for the two instruments.</p><p>Putting that aside,</p><p>&gt;Suppose you played the bassoon partials on piano voice, and got the volumes<br/>and<br/>&gt;pitches all exactly right.</p><p>&gt;Then there would be no way of telling from the partials if what you heard<br/>were<br/>&gt;several bassoons playing a piano timbre, or several pianos playing a<br/>bassoon timbre.<br/>&gt;Both in theory should sound identical.</p><p>&gt;To see that (except perhaps you do anyway on just mentioning the idea)<br/>&gt;make an array with the first row giving the bassoon partials, the first<br/>column the piano<br/>&gt;partials, and each entry is result of multiplying the volumes of the corr.<br/>bassoon and<br/>&gt;piano partials together.

Also a realistic bassoon<br/>timbre has &quot;formants&quot; -- absolute frequencies at which partials tend to be<br/>reinforced or attenuated. Your matrix method would ignore these features in<br/>making the assumption that the timbre in one register is an exact<br/>transposition of the timbre in another register.</p><p>Anyway, in your matrix method you are going to have the set of bassoons or<br/>the set of pianos playing one big otonal chord.

So rather than sounding like a chord of bassoons<br/>or a chord of pianos, I expect this to sound like one big low note in a<br/>timbre that is richer than either bassoon or piano.</p></div><h3>jpehrson@rcn.com</h3><span>2/7/2001 1:34:27 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In tuning@y..., &quot;Paul H.
