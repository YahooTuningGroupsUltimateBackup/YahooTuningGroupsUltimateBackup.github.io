Balzano, in his 1980<br/>&gt;&gt;paper in Computer Music Journal, showed that the smallest proper set of<br/>&gt;&gt;12tET to contain all twelve intervals is the diatonic scale.  In fact, I<br/>&gt;&gt;think this is true of any series-of-fifths-gerenated scale tuned in the<br/>&gt;&gt;next highest ET in the series 3, 5, 7, 12, 19, 31.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;Actually, the smallest subset of 12TET containing all 12 (or 6,<br/>&gt;disregarding inversions) intervals IS the C-Db-E-F#, or C-Db-Eb-G set and<br/>&gt;their inversions.</p><p>But they are not proper subsets.</p><p>&gt;I think what Balzano was pointing out was a even wieirder property of the<br/>&gt;diatonic scale.  If you look at the intervals between: each note of the<br/>&gt;scale, and all of the other notes in the scale; then, you will see that<br/>&gt;each kind of interval appears a unique number of times.</p><p>I don&apos;t remember him pointing this out, but I wouldn&apos;t put it past him --<br/>what possible significance could this property have?</p><p>&gt;This helps &quot;efficiency&quot; I guess, as if you get one semitone (say, B-C)<br/>&gt;and then part of the other semitone (F#) then you know what transposition<br/>&gt;of diatonicity you&apos;re in (BCDEF#GA).</p><p>Sorry, I don&apos;t follow.  B-C-F# may be a sufficient set of the diatonic<br/>scale, but I don&apos;t see how the unique-number-of-times property helps<br/>lower efficiency.  And since Balzano was interested in duplicating every<br/>property of the diatonic scale he happened to notice, he would want high<br/>efficiency, anyway.</p><p>-Carl</p></div>
