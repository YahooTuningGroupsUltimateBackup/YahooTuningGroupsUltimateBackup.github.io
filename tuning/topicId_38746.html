I&apos;ve also been told that<br/>the more interest there is, the more likely it is they<br/>will grant my request.<br/>By way of brief review, Gigastudio Version 2 has the<br/>biggest sound sample library I know of; it takes a<br/>whole fast new computer and many gigabytes of memory<br/>just to hold the program and its sound files. As a<br/>result, you can get incredibly accurate, commercial<br/>CD-quality samples for your musicmaking. The sound<br/>library is huge and growing, for all kinds of music.<br/>But it&apos;s a huge problem for people who want to<br/>customize their tunings. I found that in order to<br/>retune Garritan Strings to 53-equal, I would have to<br/>enter 300,000 manual commands!<br/>So I&apos;ll ask again, if you haven&apos;t done this yet:<br/>PLEASE write them, tell them what kind of tuning<br/>you&apos;re interested in (ethnic, hard-core micrtonal,<br/>early music, Valotti, Pythagorean, whatever: the more<br/>the merrier!) and ask if future versions of Gigastudio<br/>will have a custom tuning macro or some kind of tuning<br/>template. If we get this, it may well be the single<br/>most powerful tool we can have for our microtonal<br/>musicmaking!<br/>Thanks in advance for helping. If anyone does help,<br/>I&apos;ll owe you five or ten minutes helping you when next<br/>you decide to do an e-mail campaign for something.<br/>Their e-mail address is <a href="mailto:gigateam@tascam.com">gigateam@tascam.com</a> or<br/><a href="mailto:custser@tascam.com">custser@tascam.com</a>.<br/>Thank you thank you thank you.<br/>Chris Mohr</p><p>__________________________________________________<br/>Do You Yahoo!?<br/>Yahoo!
