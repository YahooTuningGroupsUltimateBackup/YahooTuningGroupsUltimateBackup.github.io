I confess straight out that, as a musical form/culture, I<br/>still have a difficult time with the genre. I may never get over that<br/>completely. But it has been fascinating to have your perspective on<br/>it&apos;s history, how it is practitioned and performed, and the many<br/>insights into the musical and extra-musical elements that form the<br/>corpus of barbershop artistry. Very illuminating for me, as well as<br/>for others I&apos;m sure...</p><p>Cheers,<br/>Jon</p></div><h3><a id=65487 href="#65487">ðŸ”—</a>Aaron Wolf &#x3C;backfromthesilo@yahoo.com&#x3E;</h3><span>3/15/2006 10:02:25 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;Jon Szanto&quot; &lt;jszanto@...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Aaron,<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I just wanted to do a shout out to you for all your recent postings on<br/>&gt; barbershop.

I have learned<br/>much from this list, and from the experts in the barbershop world, and<br/>many, many other sources, and I only hope my input can be as useful<br/>to others, while I continue my own never-ending studies and goals.</p><p>-Aaron</p></div>
