He performed them on a guitar whose fretboard had<br/>six<br/>&gt;&gt;          grooves running the length of it, one under each string, with 24<br/>&gt;&gt;(at least,<br/>&gt;&gt;          possibly more) slideable frets in each groove, each fret long<br/>&gt;&gt;enough for<br/>&gt;&gt;          just one string. This guitar is capable of retuning to any<br/>&gt;&gt;possible scale<br/>&gt;&gt;          within the space limitations of the frets and fingers.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;Anyone have pointers to more info about Hoogewerf ?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;2)<br/>&gt;Johnny also posted this way back when :<br/>&gt;&gt;Then Virgil Moorefield scared everyone by playing ELECTRIC right up in the<br/>&gt;&gt;first row.  During dress rehearsal, I did feel there was one spot that<br/>&gt;&gt;might be a bit TOO loud to and mentioned it to<br/>&gt;&gt;electric guitarist Evans Wohlforth<br/>&gt;Any pointers/info for Wohlforth ?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;3)<br/>&gt;Has anyone here tried the Lyrrus GVOX Guitar system ?

As to a just intonation version, I&apos;m quite<br/>&gt;invited by the prospect.  More demanding and gripping, certainly.  Not the<br/>&gt;sort of thing I&apos;d want to wake up to, though.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;The Mentally Murdered EP, on the other hand, is a gem so exquisite that I<br/>&gt;fear the polish of just intonation would only serve to spoil its beauty.<br/>&gt;However, I see the question was about &quot;music one is not personally fond<br/>of&quot;,<br/>&gt;so maybe my comments here aren&apos;t so relevant after all.  I don&apos;t really<br/>care<br/>&gt;how music I don&apos;t like gets played.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;Incidentally, as I&apos;m using EMACS today, I couldn&apos;t help putting the<br/>question<br/>&gt;&quot;Should Napalm Death play in just intonation&quot; to ELIZA.  His reply was<br/>&quot;This<br/>&gt;is not a healthy way of thinking.&quot; I think we should leave the matter<br/>there.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;Which brings us neatly to the subject of AI.  My response on reading the<br/>&gt;initial New Scientist article on SARA was that they shouldn&apos;t really have<br/>&gt;compressed everything into 12-equal.  As Mozart used staff notation, and<br/>&gt;seemed to have some idea of meantone temperament, the whole thing could<br/>have<br/>&gt;been potentially microtonal from the start.  That would mean using two<br/>&gt;numbers for each note.  The way it seemed to be done assumed the same motif<br/>&gt;would be &quot;similar&quot; when transposed to different scale degrees.  This won&apos;t<br/>&gt;hold outside of equal temperament.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;To Dan Stearns, and my quest to understand his terminology.  So, we have a<br/>&gt;scale defined as mw+nh where all numbers are integers.  The interior set is<br/>&gt;where h is an interval larger than a unison, the perimeter set is where h<br/>is<br/>&gt;a unison, and the exterior set is where h is smaller than a unison.  These<br/>&gt;exterior sets, if such they be, look to be of some theoretical, but little<br/>&gt;musical, value.  I can&apos;t see musicians counting both up and down to<br/>&gt;construct their scales.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;It was pointed out a while ago that, if we&apos;re going to put lots of highly<br/>&gt;theoretical stuff on the list, we should try and give it some connection to<br/>&gt;what musicians might find useful.  The advantage I see of classifying<br/>scales<br/>&gt;in this way is that a similar notation can be used for scales from the same<br/>&gt;class.  Also, there may be a similar feel to the scales, but you need to<br/>try<br/>&gt;them out to be sure of that.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;I&apos;m still working with 3+4 scales, to which I will now attach the cute name<br/>&gt;&quot;neutronic&quot; after their neutral thirds.  I&apos;ll also call &quot;my&quot; scale the<br/>&gt;&quot;symmetrical&quot; version and &quot;Paul&apos;s&quot; scale (which he says is also Arabic) I<br/>&gt;will term &quot;tetrachordal&quot;.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;I have Manuel&apos;s scale list, but these are all dry numbers with nothing of<br/>&gt;how the scales are used in real music.  The relevant scales are presumably<br/>&gt;those in 12-equal with two quarter-tone additions.  There aren&apos;t any<br/>&gt;symmetrical neutronic scales here as you need three notes from the<br/>&gt;alternative spiral of fifths.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;A meantone-derived keyboard mapping for neutronic scales would have the<br/>&gt;white notes in yuor favourite meantone, with C/, E\, F/ and B\ where the /<br/>&gt;and \ symbols are for half-sharps and half-flats respectively.  These are<br/>&gt;literally what you get by halving the interval a sharp would normally<br/>&gt;represent.  I prefer having the white notes as a symmetrical neutronic<br/>scale<br/>&gt;in the way I mentioned before, and each black note a quartertone flat of<br/>the<br/>&gt;white note on the right.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;Paul Erlich:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt;Well, I&apos;m not a big fan of maximal evenness, as my paper makes clear. If<br/>&gt;&gt;I could rewrite the contest, I&apos;d eliminate that, but maybe allow for a<br/>&gt;&gt;structure that spans a 5:4 and occurs 3 times in every octave span (as<br/>&gt;&gt;in the ME 22-out-of-41).<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;Ah yes, if in doubt, change the rules! The version of your paper I&apos;ve got<br/>&gt;(the original HTML one) doesn&apos;t make clear any dislike of maximal evenness<br/>&gt;that I can see.  And I did read it through, so I don&apos;t think there are any<br/>&gt;assertions hiding anywhere.  I do agree with what you say in it that<br/>&gt;maximally even scales are good choices for the &quot;natural&quot; scales.  Maximally<br/>&gt;even scales will tend towards an equal temperament, which may or may not be<br/>&gt;a good thing depending on what you&apos;re trying to do.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;I don&apos;t think a melodic rule should presuppose both a 3/2 _and_ a 5/4.  I<br/>&gt;don&apos;t have an alternative, though.  I prefer my ears to be the criterion<br/>for<br/>&gt;melodic valye.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;At the moment, I prefer the symmetrical scales as they are more in tune<br/>with<br/>&gt;what I&apos;m trying to say.  Even though they are weaker melodically.<br/>&gt;Tetrachordal scales aren&apos;t strange enough for me.  I&apos;m trying to break away<br/>&gt;from the diatonic scale and that &quot;normal&quot; pentatonic is too familiar.<br/>&gt;Mostly, though, the tetrachordal scales sound too cheerful.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;I&apos;m also looking at 5-note subsets built t s t+s s t+s or s t t+s s t+s<br/>&gt;where t is the larger and s the smaller second as before.  I&apos;m finding a<br/>lot<br/>&gt;in them which I can&apos;t really describe.  They aren&apos;t self-sufficient<br/>&gt;harmonically, so I&apos;m using a full symmetrical scale for the chords.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;I have worked out a symmetrical scale on my guitar.  It&apos;s a pain, though,<br/>as<br/>&gt;it doesn&apos;t include any open strings.  Does anyone, perchance, have a way of<br/>&gt;tuning the strings so that neutronic scales come out more easily with a<br/>&gt;meantone fretting?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;    Right, I&apos;ll leave it there.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;       Graham<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<a href="http://www.cix.co.uk/~gbreed/">http://www.cix.co.uk/~gbreed/</a><br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;___________________________________________________________________________<br/>____<br/>&gt;___________________________________________________________________________<br/>____<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;</p></div>
