For example, in this type of written cadence:</p><p>            D4   C#4  D4<br/>            A3   G#3  A3<br/>            F3   E3   D3</p><p>the first sixth sonority F3-A3-D4 has usual Pythagorean intervals<br/>(~0-408-906 cents), while E3-Ab3-Db4 (as actually tuned on the<br/>keyboard) has a near-5-limit sonority (~0-384-882 cents). The precise<br/>ratios are 81:64 and 27:16 for the usual Pythagorean major third and<br/>sixth, and 8192:6561 and 32768:19683 for the schismatic counterparts<br/>(actually diminished fourths and sevenths).</p><p>While one can also give the Ramos monochord scheme (I agree with Lindley<br/>that his practical 12-note keyboard tuning seems to be some kind of<br/>meantone in Ab-C#), or other schemes with a Wolf fifth among the diatonic<br/>notes or at Bb-F, I would suggest that the Gb-B scheme was likely typical<br/>for the earlier 15th century, with more or less regular meantone coming<br/>into vogue around 1450-1480.</p><p>Most appreciatively,</p><p>Margo Schulter<br/><a href="mailto:mschulter@value.net">mschulter@value.net</a></p></div><h3><a id=43018 href="#43018">ðŸ”—</a>monz &#x3C;monz@attglobal.net&#x3E;</h3><span>3/26/2003 12:37:36 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>hello Margo,</p><p>i&apos;ve been hoping to see your intelligent and<br/>inventive comments on the latest few of my<br/>webpages.  this post would make a great addendum<br/>to my latest page, on schismatic tuning</p><p><a href="http://sonic-arts.org/dict/schismatic-tuning.htm">http://sonic-arts.org/dict/schismatic-tuning.htm</a></p><p>may i use it?</p><p>-monz</p><p>&gt; From: &quot;M.
