I&apos;m *trying* to write at least one symphony.  No. 1 in C minor<br/>will feature in its first movement a few bagpipe solos as well as some brass<br/>parts in the septimal register; other than that, not a lot of other microtonals<br/>as of yet.</p><p>If and when Symphony No. 2 comes along, I will *try* to work in some 31-tone (or<br/>at least 19-tone) string parts for one of the movements.  But I&apos;m not really<br/>that much of an experimentalist, not any more than, say, Stravinsky or Bartok,<br/>and slightly less than Schoenberg.  I&apos;m more like Beethoven actually.</p><p>My aim is to promote 19- and 31-tone equal and just as alternatives to 12-tone<br/>for existing compositions, not just pieces composed for xenharmonic tunings.  I<br/>also want to use these extended scales in jazz, rock, r&amp;b, country and other<br/>popular styles (i.e. 19-tone guitars and such).</p><p>I had a couple MIDI files of entry-level microtonal pieces, &iuml;&iquest;&half;tudes for violin,<br/>both using an uneven 10-tone scale I call &quot;macrotonal&quot; because it involves two<br/>3/4-tone steps, but I lost them sometime since I&apos;ve moved about a dozen times or<br/>so....</p><p>Also, I came up with a 19-tone and a 31-tone layout for a piano/organ keyboard,<br/>both of which I might get patented.  (Not to make money, just to protect my<br/>ideas.)  The 31-tone is less complicated but less versatile than Fokker&apos;s &quot;blue<br/>key&quot; system.  Both are augmentations of the traditional 12-tone keyboard.</p><p>So now I&apos;ll just sit back and get caught up on all the conversation....</p><p>Danny Wier<br/>Lufkin, Texas USA</p><p>_________________________________________________________<br/>Do You Yahoo!?<br/>Get your free <a href="https://twitter.com/yahoo">@yahoo</a>.com address at <a href="http://mail.yahoo.com">http://mail.yahoo.com</a></p></div><h3><a id=29161 href="#29161">ðŸ”—</a>Clark &#x3C;CACCOLA@NET1PLUS.COM&#x3E;</h3><span>10/15/2001 6:17:02 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Hi, Danny;</p><p>&gt; I came up with a 19-tone and a 31-tone layout for a piano/organ<br/>&gt; keyboard,</p><p>Cool!</p><p>&gt; both of which I might get patented.

That website is giving me grief with<br/>their image files.  They&apos;re all in .tiff format, and I installed AlternaTIFF,<br/>but I still can&apos;t get it to work.</p><p>I was able to see the patent for Yamaha&apos;s 19-tone keyboard (and other<br/>instruments).  It&apos;s a standard 12-tone keyboard with seven additional keys above<br/>the keyboard for the sharps (including B#/Cb and E#/Fb); the black keys are<br/>specifically for the flats.</p><p>My version is a standard 12-tone keyboard with a set of &quot;brown keys&quot;, or wooden<br/>bars, seven to an octave and placed in front of and below the white keys, each<br/>one in between two white keys.  These are the flats (including Cb/B# and Fb/E#),<br/>while the black keys, still five to an octave, are now the sharps.  This puts<br/>the sharps and flats in a more logical position in relation to the naturals, but<br/>requires a change in technique, using the thumb quite often on the lower flat<br/>keys.  (I finger a C minor seventh chord with the right hand thusly: C with<br/>index finger, Eb with thumb, G with ring finger, Bb with little finger.)</p><p>| &gt; The 31-tone is less complicated but less versatile than Fokker&apos;s<br/>| &gt; &quot;blue key&quot; system.

I have<br/>five rows of black, white and brown keys, but they&apos;re not too conveniently<br/>placed.  This is not a generalized keyboard, since the middle row of white keys<br/>plays the C major scale.</p><p>The idea is to make microtonal keyboards that look familiar to people used to<br/>the good ol&apos; standard keyboard.</p><p>~DaW~</p><p>_________________________________________________________<br/>Do You Yahoo!?<br/>Get your free <a href="https://twitter.com/yahoo">@yahoo</a>.com address at <a href="http://mail.yahoo.com">http://mail.yahoo.com</a></p></div><h3><a id=29284 href="#29284">ðŸ”—</a>genewardsmith@juno.com</h3><span>10/18/2001 2:10:14 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In tuning@y..., &quot;Danny Wier&quot; &lt;dawier@y...&gt; wrote:</p><p>&gt; The idea is to make microtonal keyboards that look familiar to<br/>people used to<br/>&gt; the good ol&apos; standard keyboard.</p><p>My proposal for doing that is three rows of white keys, playing B#,<br/>C, and D-double-flat, and two rows of black keys between them.</p></div><h3><a id=29294 href="#29294">ðŸ”—</a>Danny Wier &#x3C;dawier@yahoo.com&#x3E;</h3><span>10/18/2001 10:45:34 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>From: <a href="mailto:genewardsmith@juno.com">genewardsmith@juno.com</a></p><p>| My proposal for doing that is three rows of white keys, playing B#,<br/>| C, and D-double-flat, and two rows of black keys between them.</p><p>Not a bad idea, ya know.

I got a peek at a Microzone on<br/>Friday, along with Harold Fortuin&apos;s delightful Clavette.

But I don&apos;t think the visual or<br/>fingering differences of Janko&apos;s and Perzina&apos;s 12-tone keyboards from<br/>standard are all that impaired their success, and though it wouldn&apos;t be<br/>difficult to control eight pianos from a Microzone (I guess, after<br/>pitches are assigned) it would be expensive. I still like mechanical<br/>actions (and non-synthesized sounds), and would put up with foreign<br/>mapping and wider octaves if these permitted keys to work as well as<br/>usual.</p><p>It sounds like you have a working 19-tone keyboard instrument, would you<br/>mind describing it?</p><p>Regards,</p><p>Clark</p></div><h3><a id=29535 href="#29535">ðŸ”—</a>Danny Wier &#x3C;dawier@yahoo.com&#x3E;</h3><span>10/25/2001 3:59:36 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>From: Clark (about my 19-tone keyboard)</p><p>| That pattern seems to fit pretty well for 12 - besides corresponding<br/>| nicely to a statistical map and providing good orientation, it&apos;s<br/>| relatively easy to manufacture and service.

I have taken electronic music courses and know the basics of the physics of sound.  For this project I am trying to apply the concepts that I know from studying brass instruments to a choral setting.  I read the information about John &apos;Longitude&apos; Harrison suggested to my by Lucy, but I think that these ideas a little beyond what I am trying to accomplish with my presentation.</p><p>I am aiming to discuss with choral directors in a relatively simple way why relying on a piano for tuning will not allow the choir to sing as &quot;in tune&quot; as it can.  The extent to which I wish to take this idea is similar to that of the Oberlin school and particular the group Cantus.  I am especially interested in showing visually the results of different tunings (et12 vs. based on the series or just) on a chordal choral sound.</p><p>I think that the idea of &quot;adaptive just-intonation&quot; suggested by &quot;wallyesterpaulrus&quot; is exactly what I am looking for.  We use it a lot in good vocal (and wind) groups, but we seldom talk about why it can change a mediocre group into a great group.  I hope to offer directors and students visual and audio examples of why a this type of tuning is beneficial and why it sounds right to our ears.</p><p>I will check out the sonic-arts web page.  I am starting a tour this week with the university wind ensemble, so I may not be as quick on the response.  I do still want any input that anyone is willing to give me.  I am especially interested if someone knows a good place that I can find a program to show visual examples of the benefits of &quot;just&quot; intonation.</p><p>Thank you all so much!
