They are remarkable quality and made by a<br/>place called Omega strings, which is one man about 70 miles west of me. I happen to run<br/>accross one of his instruments in a shop and was so impressed with how much louder it was<br/>than any i had heard that i called him up. To build ones instruments is one thing, but if<br/>you find some one who does better than you know you can do, it seems best to patronize<br/>their work. he has wanted to make bass instruments but hasn&apos;t done so yet. The stay<br/>pretty well in tune unlike many of this family.f</p><p>&gt;<br/>&gt;    From: &quot;wallyesterpaulrus&quot; &lt;<a href="mailto:wallyesterpaulrus@yahoo.com">wallyesterpaulrus@yahoo.com</a>&gt;<br/>&gt; Subject: Re: metaslendro MP3.s<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; this is remarkable stuff, kraig -- thanks for sharing! what is the<br/>&gt; bowed instrument sound?<br/>&gt;</p><p>-- -Kraig Grady<br/>North American Embassy of Anaphoria Island<br/> <a href="http://www.anaphoria.com">http://www.anaphoria.com</a><br/>The Wandering Medicine Show<br/> KXLU 88.9 FM WED 8-9PM PST</p></div>
