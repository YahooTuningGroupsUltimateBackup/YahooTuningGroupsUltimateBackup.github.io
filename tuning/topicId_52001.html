For instance, texts that discuss some &quot;music theory&quot; of harmonic progressions within the Monophonic Fabric (other than the short cursory chapter on resolution in &quot;Genesis&quot;), or that discuss possibilities inherent in higher n-limit &quot;Monophonic fabrics&quot;, etc.  It seems that using traditional tonal music theory to describe JI phenomenon is like trying to put a bull into a baby&apos;s playpen.  My Master&apos;s Thesis is likely going to be an electroacoustic piece which integrally uses Just Intonation concepts, so I&apos;d like to be as well-read and well-versed as I can.  (And, of course, I&apos;m messing around in Scala with Partch&apos;s 11-limit Monophonic Fabric ad naueseam  -- what an incredible program!!!)

His writings can be dense and<br/>forbidding, with most of the information embedded in beautiful<br/>diagrams. Luckily for you, some of us here have spent large amounts<br/>of time thinking about and discussing his work and have even having<br/>done some of the same work independently. Many of Wilson&apos;s works are<br/>collected here:</p><p><a href="http://www.anaphoria.com/wilson.html">http://www.anaphoria.com/wilson.html</a></p><p>Some of these papers include generalized (hexagonal-array) keyboard<br/>diagrams for Partch&apos;s &apos;Monophonic Fabric&apos;. One paper which discusses<br/>Partch&apos;s Diamonds, as well as some of Wilson&apos;s analogous<br/>constructions (which have been used by many JI composers), is</p><p><a href="http://www.anaphoria.com/dal.PDF">http://www.anaphoria.com/dal.PDF</a></p><p>I put together the following article which focuses on just one<br/>diagram in the paper above and attempts a gentle explanation:</p><p><a href="http://tonalsoft.com/td/erlich/paul-cps.htm">http://tonalsoft.com/td/erlich/paul-cps.htm</a></p><p>(2) The &apos;anaphoria&apos; website is the creation of Kraig Grady, an<br/>instrument-maker, composer, and theorist in Partch&apos;s tradition.<br/>Browse around the directories there and you will be treated to a<br/>wealth of Partch-inspired items.</p><p>(3) If you&apos;re interested in a tuning system which approximates (to<br/>within a couple of cents) Partchian harmonies -- and even, if<br/>desired, the entire &apos;Monophonic Fabric&apos; -- but is<br/>generated &apos;linearly&apos;, as conventional Western tonal materials are, a<br/>number of composers and theorists here have been working on a system<br/>first proposed in 1975:</p><p><a href="http://www.anaphoria.com/secor.PDF">http://www.anaphoria.com/secor.PDF</a></p><p>The system was rediscovered on this list and has spawned an enormous<br/>wealth of posts, beautiful diagrams, and even some music ;) Here&apos;s<br/>just one page on this:</p><p><a href="http://tonalsoft.com/enc/miracle.htm">http://tonalsoft.com/enc/miracle.htm</a></p><p>The discussions on this were one reason a separate list, tuning-math,<br/>was started for the more math-heavy discussions . . .</p><p>#5 would surely have to be Prent Rodgers:</p><p><a href="http://home.comcast.net/~prodgers13/">http://home.comcast.net/~prodgers13/</a></p><p>(9) Skipping now to the bottom of the list ;) Much of my own work<br/>deals with Just Intonation.
