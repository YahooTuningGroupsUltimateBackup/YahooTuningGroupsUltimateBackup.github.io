It&apos;s a<br/>&quot;wolf minor third&quot;. It certainly can&apos;t form an acceptable D:F:A triad.</p><p>Because of this, I think it would be stretching things a bit to call this a<br/>diatonic scale. But I guess there is a lot of diatonic music with no ii chord.</p><p>You wrote 4:5:6|27:32 for the V7 in this scale. It can also be written<br/>meaningfully as 9[4:5:6]:16. 4:5:6|5:6 is also 5[4:5:6]:9 or redundantly<br/>5[4:5:6|5:6]9.</p><p>Which reminds me. Some folk (not Monz) have been writing the 5-limit just<br/>minor triad as 1/(4:5:6). This violates the convention that pitches<br/>increase from left to right. It should of course be 1/(6:5:4) since this is<br/>shorthand for 1/6 : 1/5 : 1/4.</p><p>Monz, thanks for correcting my adaptive tuning scheme with the 4:5:6:7. I<br/>actually was under the misaprehension that the G had to shift _up_ in pitch<br/>going from the G7 to the C chord. I guess that JdL&apos;s algorithm would<br/>produce something like this (the corrected version). I repeat that I don&apos;t<br/>think there&apos;s anything &apos;natural&apos; about it, at least not in a diatonic context.</p><p>You might like to add the following example. It&apos;s adaptive JI using the 5:9<br/>instead of the 4:7. Instead of a single syntonic comma shift between F and<br/>G7 we&apos;ve spread it over the 3 transitions. This is equivalent to having the<br/>roots in 1/3-comma meantone with vertical JI. I expect 5[4:5:6|5:6]9 would<br/>be a lot easier to sing a cappella than 9[4:5:6|27:32]16 (because all but<br/>one of its 6 intervals can &quot;lock in&quot; and the 6th one is far enough away<br/>from anything simple that it will have no &quot;pull&quot; in any particular<br/>direction), and I expect it will sound more natural in a diatonic context<br/>than 4:5:6:7. Maybe this is the one that can satisfy both Dave and Jerry?</p><p>F        4/3  27/20<br/>E  5/4               5/4<br/>D              9/8<br/>C  1/1   1/1         1/1<br/>B             15/8<br/>A        5/3<br/>G  3/2         3/2   3/2</p><p>         all   all<br/>        +7.2c -7.2c</p><p>It would have been nice to give Jerry just this one and the adaptive<br/>4:5:6:7 &quot;barbershop&quot; one in a blind test to see which he preferred, and<br/>which he thought his singers were (or should be) closest to.</p><p>Thanks again Monz.</p><p>Regards,</p><p>-- Dave Keenan<br/><a href="http://uq.net.au/~zzdkeena">http://uq.net.au/~zzdkeena</a></p></div><h3>D.Stearns &#x3C;stearns@capecod.net&#x3E;</h3><span>2/15/2000 9:56:47 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>[David C Keenan:]<br/>&gt;Some folk (not Monz) have been writing the 5-limit just minor triad<br/>as 1/(4:5:6).
