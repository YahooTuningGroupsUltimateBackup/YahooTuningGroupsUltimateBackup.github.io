Have you heard his 24Tune?  It&apos;s on his webpage under<br/>list of works.  I actually like it better than invisible haircut.</p><p>&gt;It is magical how JI transcription happened to &quot;work&quot; on this one.</p><p>Ackg!  JI can always work this well, no magic.</p><p>&gt;This type of transcription, with 11 and 13 and 19 identities, leads to a<br/>&gt;pronounced &quot;periodicity buzz&quot; in the otonalities</p><p>This is the most pleasant thing, isn&apos;t it?  It is what I call &quot;florescent<br/>lightingness&quot; at the 7-limit.  It is the first thing to leave a just chord<br/>with detuning.  Only 34 and 53, of the ET&apos;s I considered, have it for the<br/>4:5:6 chord.</p></div><h3>Paul H.
