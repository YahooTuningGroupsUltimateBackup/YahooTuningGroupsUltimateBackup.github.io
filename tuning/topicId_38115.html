JI includes only systems or sets of tones related by<br/>&gt; intervals that are defined as small-number (i.e., rational) ratios.<br/>&gt; This involves two concepts:</p><p>I count more than that.</p><p>&gt; There is some point, however, at which a harmonic limit can be so<br/>&gt; high as to be meaningless.  I think that I can safely conclude that<br/>&gt; you have exceeded it.</p><p>He did get up to the 19087-limit.</p><p>&gt; 2)  Ratio<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Any tuning in which a rational interval (no matter how small)<br/>&gt; vanishes is by definition a temperament, not a rational tuning.</p><p>What about a tuning where octaves are stretched, but with no commas?</p><p>&gt; However, we could save ourselves a lot of grief by calling these low-<br/>&gt; error temperaments &quot;near-just&quot; tunings or temperaments and refraining<br/>&gt; from misrepresenting them as &quot;just intonation&quot;, because, by<br/>&gt; definition, they aren&apos;t JI.</p><p>Which means, of course, JI is theory--which is an idea I like. It also<br/>means that JI cannot possibly be the unique possessor of the Omnitude of<br/>pure, powerful healing sounds. So where does that start?</p><p>&gt; May I suggest that (taking 72-ET as a point of departure) only<br/>&gt; temperaments having an error less than 4 cents for all of the<br/>&gt; consonances being represented within the specified harmonic limit<br/>&gt; (and less than 2 cents for 2:3 and 3:4) be designated &quot;near-just&quot;?</p><p>We&apos;ve got a term &quot;wafso-just&quot; which is like what you are proposing. When<br/>I say &quot;effectively just&quot; I mean something stronger than that; within a<br/>1/2 cent of just at least. Hence I&apos;ve called 118 &quot;effectively just&quot; in<br/>the 5-limit,<br/>and 171 or the ennealimmal temperament effectively just in the 7-imit. I<br/>also don&apos;t call something a &quot;microtemperament&quot; unless it gets closer to<br/>just than 72 does--octoid or the 224-et I call microtemperaments, but I<br/>don&apos;t yet have the courage to call them &quot;effectively just&quot;, despite how<br/>hard it is to find any difference.</p></div>
