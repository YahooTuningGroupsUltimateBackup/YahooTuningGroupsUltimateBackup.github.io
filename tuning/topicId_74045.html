There is no such thing a &quot;the&quot; mensur of modern<br/>pianos, nor are they (al of the different variants) &quot;optimized&quot; for<br/>any size of fifth. The vast majority of modern writing about piano<br/>scales is complete and utter nonsense, almost everything you can find<br/>in even the best acoustics works is written in total ignorance of the<br/>actual history of the development of piano design as evident in the<br/>surviving instruments themselves. So many times I have a good laugh at<br/>reading yet another &quot;learned&quot; tract going on about some perfect design<br/>to achieve some intricate balance of whatever, and I think to myself,<br/>these guys haven&apos;t even taken the time to actually go look at all the<br/>instruments. I personally know of one modern organologist who was<br/>adding to the dung pile by basing his work on that of another previous<br/>pile of dung, and who, when I personally gave him a list of a number<br/>of important and prominent instruments he should go LOOK AT which<br/>disproved the whole lot, choose rather to ignore and publish anyway,<br/>with the footnote that I had mentioned perhaps there are &quot;some&quot;<br/>instruments which don&apos;t display this aspect.</p><p>Piano scaling comes from harpsichord scaling, and like many<br/>harpsichord scales of the Germanic tradition, the scale is stretched<br/>non-Pythagorean going up merely to take advantage of the fact that<br/>smaller diameters of premodern steel wire were relatively stronger<br/>than larger diameters (proportional to cross sectional area), meaning<br/>you can get away with longer strings which ring better and have less<br/>internal damping and inharmonicity problems when you get way up in the<br/>treble.

I already told you once that this was an<br/>invalid conclusion. Look, explaining all the details of piano design<br/>in this respect would take far more time than I have, and first you<br/>should go do a bunch of basic preparatory work on materials strength,<br/>Young&apos;s modulus, stress/strain curves, plastic/elastic extension<br/>regions, etc etc etc, which I doubt you are interested in. This is if<br/>you want to really understand everything in modern intellectual terms.<br/>Old makers of course didn&apos;t understand it in the same way, but<br/>understand it they did because they HAD to. They were building<br/>instruments at many different pitch levels and pusing their wire to<br/>the limits. This means if you made a mistake in one direction, the<br/>instrument sounded dull and false, and if you made a mistake in the<br/>other direction, the strings broke. Their is documentary evidence that<br/>both did indeed occasionally happen.</p><p>Now, specifically, about temperament. The totality of an instruments<br/>scale is the result of three REGULAR aspects: (1) the so-called string<br/>band, which is an even distribution across the instrument of the<br/>choirs of strings which matches the regular distribution of the<br/>keyboard and action. Until the introduction of the overstrung design<br/>in 1857 (and for a long time thereafter for builders who continued<br/>making straight strung instruments, as many did), this is a set of<br/>parallel equally spaced lines. (2) A spline curve, which intersects<br/>the string band. This produces a regular proportional change in string<br/>length from note to note which in no way mirrors the IRREGULAR<br/>proportional changes from note to note required to produce anything<br/>other than equal temperament. This is true for ALL instruments, no<br/>matter what time period we are discussing. Granted, the interruptions<br/>in the regularity of both caused by the layout of the modern<br/>overstrung frame make this hard to see, but if you actually climb<br/>inside such a monster and measure the length of EVERY string and then<br/>compare them to stringing scales stretching back for several<br/>centuries, you will find that there is no real difference, except for<br/>the progressive lengthening of the entire scale throughout the 19th<br/>century as every harder steels became available. (3) The reduction in<br/>diameter, which almost always follows a regular distribution, that is,<br/>the steps between gauge changes are regular.</p><p>The problem with these elegant theories of balance between scaling and<br/>inharmonicity is that the coefficient of inharmoncity is NOT constant<br/>over the entire scale. It is highest in the upper octaves, dropping to<br/>very low in the middle octaves, and then rising again for the tenor.<br/>The bass bridge is a completely different world because you can design<br/>wound strings to have a wide range of elasticity, so you can leave the<br/>bass bridge out of the discussion entirely. Now I would like you or<br/>anyone to explain to me how the intersection of three regular<br/>progressions can in some way add up to compensate for a factor which<br/>is highly irregular.</p><p>Beyond all that is the inconvenient truth that other aspects of the<br/>instruments design (soundboard compliance, ribbing, downbearing, after<br/>and forelength, etc etc etc) can also cause inharmonicity to vary from<br/>region to region, even from note to note.</p><p>Now, as to which temperament sounds &quot;better&quot; on a modern piano, htat<br/>is a matter of personal preference. The biggest problem with this<br/>concept is the lumping together of the truly vast variation of designs<br/>and the resultant acoustical objects under the heading &quot;the modern<br/>piano&quot;. If you think there is any sort of consistency in the presence<br/>of inharmonicity among modern pianos, then you are in for a big<br/>surprise. How strange that the makers of all advanced modern<br/>electronic tuning devices and software, like the Rayburn Cyber Tuner,<br/>go to great lengths to allow the device to analyze the inharmonicty<br/>for EVERY note on each individual piano so that the tuner can decide<br/>how to program the stretching of EACH octave (differently) in order to<br/>attempt to compensate. If we were to believe Andreas, this was all<br/>resolved by the scaling of &quot;the&quot; modern piano. Poor stupid piano<br/>tuners, they go to so much work for nothing!</p><p>Frankly, I think that any EDO which stays away from near harmonic<br/>proportions is the best way to tune a modern piano, because when there<br/>is constant rapid beating, you don&apos;t hear the large variation in<br/>interval quality over the range of the instrument caused by the large<br/>variation in inharmonicty. But that is only my preference.</p><p>Now, if that doesn&apos;t clear it up for you Oz, let me frame it in<br/>another way. The fact that cars are not designed specifically for one<br/>particular size of person does not mean that ANY size of person fits<br/>equally well in any given car.

Granted, the interruptions<br/>&gt; in the regularity of both caused by the layout of the modern<br/>&gt; overstrung frame make this hard to see, but if you actually climb<br/>&gt; inside such a monster and measure the length of EVERY string and then<br/>&gt; compare them to stringing scales stretching back for several<br/>&gt; centuries, you will find that there is no real difference, except for<br/>&gt; the progressive lengthening of the entire scale throughout the 19th<br/>&gt; century as every harder steels became available.</p><p>So, barring the overstringing, nothing has changed fundamentally over the<br/>centuries in regards to the average proportions of the keyboard instruments.</p><p>(3) The reduction in<br/>&gt; diameter, which almost always follows a regular distribution, that is,<br/>&gt; the steps between gauge changes are regular.<br/>&gt;</p><p>How regular? Can you show by an example?</p><p>&gt; The problem with these elegant theories of balance between scaling and<br/>&gt; inharmonicity is that the coefficient of inharmoncity is NOT constant<br/>&gt; over the entire scale.</p><p>That is to say, octaves are not widened by the same amount throughout the<br/>compass of the instrument when compensating for inharmonicity.</p><p>It is highest in the upper octaves, dropping to<br/>&gt; very low in the middle octaves, and then rising again for the tenor.</p><p>I see.</p><p>&gt; The bass bridge is a completely different world because you can design<br/>&gt; wound strings to have a wide range of elasticity, so you can leave the<br/>&gt; bass bridge out of the discussion entirely.</p><p>I see.</p><p>Now I would like you or<br/>&gt; anyone to explain to me how the intersection of three regular<br/>&gt; progressions can in some way add up to compensate for a factor which<br/>&gt; is highly irregular.<br/>&gt;</p><p>I dare not suggest anything in that direction.</p><p>&gt; Beyond all that is the inconvenient truth that other aspects of the<br/>&gt; instruments design (soundboard compliance, ribbing, downbearing, after<br/>&gt; and forelength, etc etc etc) can also cause inharmonicity to vary from<br/>&gt; region to region, even from note to note.<br/>&gt;</p><p>So much so, that anybody designing a stringed keyboard instrument for a<br/>particular temperament is nil?</p><p>&gt; Now, as to which temperament sounds &quot;better&quot; on a modern piano, htat<br/>&gt; is a matter of personal preference. The biggest problem with this<br/>&gt; concept is the lumping together of the truly vast variation of designs<br/>&gt; and the resultant acoustical objects under the heading &quot;the modern<br/>&gt; piano&quot;.</p><p>I can see the problem.</p><p>If you think there is any sort of consistency in the presence<br/>&gt; of inharmonicity among modern pianos, then you are in for a big<br/>&gt; surprise.</p><p>Actually, I am not surprised at all that inharmonicity varies considerably<br/>from fortepiano to fortepiano.</p><p>How strange that the makers of all advanced modern<br/>&gt; electronic tuning devices and software, like the Rayburn Cyber Tuner,<br/>&gt; go to great lengths to allow the device to analyze the inharmonicty<br/>&gt; for EVERY note on each individual piano so that the tuner can decide<br/>&gt; how to program the stretching of EACH octave (differently) in order to<br/>&gt; attempt to compensate.</p><p>Fascinating.</p><p>If we were to believe Andreas, this was all<br/>&gt; resolved by the scaling of &quot;the&quot; modern piano. Poor stupid piano<br/>&gt; tuners, they go to so much work for nothing!<br/>&gt;</p><p>I can understand your frustration.</p><p>&gt; Frankly, I think that any EDO which stays away from near harmonic<br/>&gt; proportions is the best way to tune a modern piano, because when there<br/>&gt; is constant rapid beating, you don&apos;t hear the large variation in<br/>&gt; interval quality over the range of the instrument caused by the large<br/>&gt; variation in inharmonicty. But that is only my preference.<br/>&gt;</p><p>Insteresting. But still, one can implement a custom-tailored temperament for<br/>a given piano which bodes well with harmonic proportions?</p><p>&gt; Now, if that doesn&apos;t clear it up for you Oz,</p><p>It clears up matters alright.</p><p>let me frame it in<br/>&gt; another way. The fact that cars are not designed specifically for one<br/>&gt; particular size of person does not mean that ANY size of person fits<br/>&gt; equally well in any given car. Do you see where your insistence upon<br/>&gt; drawing a connection is false?<br/>&gt;</p><p>My &quot;insistence&quot;, was rather based on the fact that any temperament might be<br/>expected to work just as fine as 12-EDO on &quot;modern pianos&quot;.</p><p>&gt; Ciao,<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; P<br/>&gt;</p><p>Oz.</p></div>
