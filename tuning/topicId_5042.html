Check it out through the Readers&apos; Guide to Periodical Literature.  Again, from recollection, the problem with piano wire is that it doesn&apos;t vibrate according to the theoretical physics ideal because of its stiffness.  The lower tones use wrapped wire which is even further from ideal.  And the lowest tones have very weak fundamentals, so what one hears as a fundamental is mainly psychoacoustic; the brain generates some of the fundamental through the harmonics.  Besides that, if the piano is tuned in equal temperament, the harmonics are neither that nor quite just intonation either.  Also note that pianos of about a century or more old were originally strung with a softer wire at lower tension which gives a softer sound (less harmonics) than the modern high tension stronger wire which gives a more brilliant tone.  If one of these old pianos is restrung with modern wire, it&apos;s likely to cause structural damage.</p><p>&gt;&gt;&gt; Carl Lumma &lt;<a href="mailto:clumma@nni.com">clumma@nni.com</a>&gt; 09/22 9:52 PM &gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>From: Carl Lumma &lt;<a href="mailto:clumma@nni.com">clumma@nni.com</a>&gt;</p><p>&gt;&gt;The stuff I hear is much higher in pitch than the notes sounding, so it<br/>&gt;&gt;couldn&apos;t be difference tones.

When I toured the Kimball factory in southern Indiana about ten years ago they had on display an old piano.  I don&apos;t recall if it was 150 or 200 years old.  But we had quite a discussion about the lower tensile strength steel they had to use to restring it to avoid damage.  Apparently higher tensile strength steel had been developed later.  It was easy to hear that it had a softer, less brilliant tone quality.  The difference was ascribed mainly if not entirely to the strings.  They also had a Bosendorfer, as the U. S. distributors, on which it was fun try those extra low tones.  I&apos;ll look this up again if not too difficult to find, but clearly (perhaps mistakenly) recall that the low harmonics are stronger than the fundamental on the lowest piano tones.  A twelve foot concert grand should have stronger bass fundamentals than a spinet.</p><p>&gt;&gt;&gt; Clark &lt;<a href="mailto:caccola@net1plus.com">caccola@net1plus.com</a>&gt; 09/24 8:23 AM &gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>A few words on this subject.

I think that the old piano was something of a restoration job in any case.  It looked as good as new, unless the guide carefully pointed out what had been done.<br/>Ah, stainless steel.  Reminds me of the early tape recorders used by the BBC, with thirty inch reels.  I wasn&apos;t there, but have seen pictures.  After the war, wire recorders had a brief popularity.  I saw an old one sometime in the last ten years, but didn&apos;t buy it.  As I recall, there was no rust on the wire, indicating that it might also have been stainless.</p><p>&gt;&gt;&gt; Clark &lt;<a href="mailto:caccola@net1plus.com">caccola@net1plus.com</a>&gt; 09/24 10:13 AM &gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>John,</p><p>We have a local _authority_ on antique pianos who maintains quite a collection.
