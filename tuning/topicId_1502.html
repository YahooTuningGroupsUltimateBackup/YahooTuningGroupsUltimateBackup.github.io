Wonder why it is<br/>&gt;that we theorists get so wrapped up in the<br/>&gt;theory ...?</p><p>Do you really not know?!!! Or are you just being coy here?</p><p>It&apos;s because science and particularly mathematics has its *own* kind of<br/>beauty! I&apos;m sure someone could write a good parody along the lines of:</p><p>&quot;I look forward to the day when you *mere composers* stop fooling around<br/>with those dry, boring, concrete sounds and start composing some decent<br/>equations and diagrams. We prefer to let our souls soar in the abstract<br/>platonic realms of mathematics, made all the more delicious by the power it<br/>gives us to predict and explain the more mundane goings on in the everyday<br/>world of music in which you poor souls choose to spend your days.&quot;</p><p>But I won&apos;t. Because some people just have not developed their sense of<br/>mathematical aesthetics, or the spiritual and mental discipline of the<br/>scientific method, and that&apos;s ok with me. I&apos;ve never composed a piece of<br/>music in my life, though I wish I could. Maybe one day I will.</p><p>Mathematics and spirituality are much closer than many people think. See<br/><a href="http://www.integralscience.org/tom/">http://www.integralscience.org/tom/</a> for some interesting relationships<br/>between the two.</p><p>By the way Monz. Thanks for all the work you put into showing those<br/>approximations to higher harmonics on the smallest reasonable 5 limit<br/>lattice. Beautiful! And that list of errors and matrices. What can I say! I<br/>enjoyed it immensely and hope to compose some theoretical pieces of my own<br/>some day, based on some of its themes. I hope it will all appear in higher<br/>resolution and colour on your website soon.</p><p>Maybe us theory types *should* put out a CD ... of profound equations and<br/>beautiful diagrams and wonderful arguments. But we don&apos;t really need to.<br/>The WWWeb is all we need.</p><p>Regards,<br/>-- Dave Keenan<br/><a href="http://uq.net.au/~zzdkeena">http://uq.net.au/~zzdkeena</a></p></div>
