Honestly - I didn&apos;t know the other options existed. But I had<br/>heard of Orwell tunings on this list and thought it was something to try<br/>once I saw the details.</p><p>(When exploring the archive I open the .scl file with notepad to see the<br/>details which is a habit only started the past couple weeks)</p><p>Yesterday  I was going through the 12 or 13 note scala files at the<br/>beginning of the list and I loaded it up in pianoteq and liked what I could<br/>play with it. I found chords that I liked the sound of that were non-12 but<br/>not too harsh. (not that I don&apos;t like harsh - just not a steady diet unless<br/>I&apos;m intending to do so).</p><p>I&apos;m glad you liked it by the way :-)</p><p>Chris</p><p>On Sat, Jul 24, 2010 at 12:21 PM, genewardsmith &lt;<a href="mailto:genewardsmith@sbcglobal.net">genewardsmith@sbcglobal.net</a><br/>&gt; wrote:</p><p>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; --- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a> &lt;tuning%<a href="http://40yahoogroups.com">40yahoogroups.com</a>&gt;, &quot;christopherv&quot;<br/>&gt; &lt;chrisvaisvil@...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; The beginning is a bit iffy - the 2nd half perhaps too boring.
