It feels a lot like Sibelius, and<br/>has quite a lot of very Sibelius like things, even down to the colouring of<br/>the voices and menu items with a familiar ring to them</p><p>It is different in input tho. It&apos;s quite nice in a way, and it could be very<br/>good. THe microtones don&apos;t play and I dont think that there is a way to<br/>program them. Still it&apos;s a better set of accidentals than Sibelius offers.<br/>But then there are many easter europeans who are very into microtones. So<br/>the programmers may be more responsive than western s/w houses.</p><p>Mark</p></div><h3><a id=47212 href="#47212">ðŸ”—</a>alternativetuning &#x3C;alternativetuning@yahoo.com&#x3E;</h3><span>9/24/2003 11:16:57 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, Mark Gould &lt;mark.gould@a...&gt; wrote:</p><p>&gt; good.

We need to see these things because we need to see exactly<br/>what it<br/>is you need in order to be able to determine whether it is possible to<br/>incorate this functionality into the program.</p><p>By the way, this is a new program and we welcome any suggestions, not<br/>just<br/>as to the technical side, but also as to where we might find<br/>publications,<br/>press, etc., in order to bring this new software to the world!&quot;</p><p>May be we could lobby together for microtone implementation?  Daniel<br/>Wolf&apos;s idea is that notation programs have two ways to go for<br/>microtones: (1) single note user-defined pitch-bends, where each<br/>pitch+accidentales combination = x cents of pitch bend, and (2) for<br/>external pitch tables (in synths or midi-to-WAV renderers), user-<br/>defined assignment of midi-note-numbers + channels to specific<br/>pitch+accidental combinations.  May be I can get him to argue for<br/>these here. Are there any other, better proposals?</p><p>Gabor</p></div>
