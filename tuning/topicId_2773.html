I don&apos;t  think i<br/>&gt; honestly can. This is the maybe a product of being on the west<br/>&gt; coast.</p><p>Speaking as a sort-of-bicoastal American, I think it would<br/>be safe to say that the differences in your respective viewpoints<br/>are due to your geographies.</p><p>New York (Dante) is *the* American connection to Europe,<br/>and Los Angeles (Kraig) is likewise the (or at least one of the)<br/>principal American connection to Asia.  And it&apos;s not merely<br/>a textbook comparison - the difference is quite palpable even<br/>in everyday life, excepting perhaps if you spend a lot of time<br/>in New York&apos;s Chinatown.</p><p>[Dante]<br/>&gt;&gt; If anything, classical musicians have their heads so in the<br/>&gt;&gt; clouds that they&apos;re not even aware there are &quot;lower classes&quot;<br/>&gt;&gt; (as you so condecendingly put it)</p><p>Altho I didn&apos;t study at Juilliard, I did attend Manhattan School<br/>of Music (just up the &apos;road&apos; [Broadway], in fact in the former<br/>Juilliard building), and I knew and hung out with a *lot* of<br/>Juilliard students.  I can vouch for what Dante says, at least in<br/>terms of that particular school.</p><p>I distinctly remember not even being able to have a conversation<br/>with Juilliardites at parties, because they spent so much time<br/>in a 4-foot square practice room that they didn&apos;t seem to have<br/>any grasp of reality at all, or perhaps they were just totally<br/>burned out from so much practicing.</p><p>[Kraig]<br/>&gt; Its the same thing and that is is purpose. Not only are they a<br/>&gt; upper class but also for the most part cultural isolationist!<br/>&gt; At 75 dollars for a decent seat to a concert who can afford<br/>&gt; to go!</p><p>I&apos;m not trying to make it sound like I&apos;m in complete agreement<br/>with either of you in this debate, but I&apos;m pretty sure that the<br/>main reason concert tickets cost so much is because classical<br/>music in this country does not have the popular support that<br/>would enable it to survive economically at a more reasonable<br/>price, and the US does not subsidize classical music to the<br/>degree that some other countries (notably in Europe) do, to<br/>take up the slack.</p><p>It&apos;s really become a pretty desperate situation.  A couple of<br/>years ago, the great Philadelphia Orchestra went on strike,<br/>which blew just about the whole concert season.  And when I<br/>arrived in San Diego last fall, I found out that the San Diego<br/>Symphony had been disbanded for lack of support! (Thankfully,<br/>by December it had just reformed and begun concerts again).</p><p>Of course, part of the cause of this is also the easy availability<br/>of alternative listening methods, such as procuring music over<br/>the web, etc., or in fact, just plain creating your own, which<br/>is becoming easier and cheaper all the time .</p><p>(I&apos;m talking specifically about more sophisticated instruments<br/>here. In truth, it costs nothing to create music by singing,<br/>drumming, or constructing your own simple instruments.)</p><p>I think the bottom line on this whole academia-elitist thing<br/>is that schools are just another type of tribal community<br/>that have to maintain certain traditions and standards in<br/>order to survive and continue to function.</p><p>I didn&apos;t finish college, and I don&apos;t think that fact has hindered<br/>my musical development one bit, in fact I would not have gone as<br/>deeply into microtonality if I had stayed in school - all my<br/>teachers discouraged me when they found out I was interested<br/>in it.</p><p>But at the same time, my ears were opened to whole new worlds<br/>of sound by my teachers and my colleagues, not to mention the<br/>concert and club scene in New York in the late 70s - worlds<br/>that I would have never known existed if left to my own devices.</p><p>And BTW, I used to get *orchestra* seat tickets for the Metropolitan<br/>Opera from my school, for free!  In those days, they were $40 seats.<br/>I got to sit 30 feet from the stage at &apos;Wozzeck&apos;, for the cost<br/>of a (50-cent) subway token.</p><p>So stop it, already!  There&apos;s good and bad in academia.</p><p>Joseph L.
