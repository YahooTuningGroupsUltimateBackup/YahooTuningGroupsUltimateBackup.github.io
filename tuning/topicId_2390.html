Don&apos;t miss this<br/>if you&apos;re in New York.</p><p>Similarly, Bulgarian kaval giant Theodosii Spassov will perform solo...and<br/>with bassoon (his idea, I promise!).  Theodosii explained to me that to<br/>master the Bulgarian peasant one must pay dues with the sheep.  The flute<br/>must &quot;move&quot; the sheep!</p><p>Flux pioneer Philip Corner composed &quot;(two) Microtonal Memories&quot; for the<br/>concert.  Thrombonist Peter Zummo joins thereminist Johnny Reinhard.  Also a<br/>Giacinto Scelsi duo &quot;Ko-Lho&quot; for flute and clarinet in quartertones.</p><p>Also in quartertones are the Julian Carillo selections played on guitar by<br/>Parisian guitarist Wim Hoogewerf.  They are &quot;Preludio Impromptu&quot; and<br/>&quot;Lentamente: Under the leaves of a millennial ahuahuetes tree in<br/>Chapultepec.&quot;  Wim will also play &quot;A Fantasie&quot; by John Dowland in Robert<br/>Dowland&apos;s preferred tuning.</p><p>My new composition &quot;Sleep&quot; for clarinet will be premiered by Michiyo Suzuki<br/>(basially jet lag and three dreams...polymicrotonal, to be sure.)</p><p>Johnny Reinhard<br/><a href="mailto:Afmmjr@aol.com">Afmmjr@aol.com</a></p></div>
