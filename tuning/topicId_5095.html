I think discovery of<br/>whatever you find is better, and why are you &quot;expecting&quot; pythagorean<br/>ratios? These flutes came long before him, right?</p><p>Beers!

After<br/>hearing a set of ancient bells at the museum here with a series of pitches<br/>that had no resemblance to the major scale the chinese govt. reported that<br/>these bells proved that the chinese invented the major scale. They finally<br/>took care of the problem of the non matching tape by RETUNING THE PITCHES TO<br/>A MAJOR SCALE. Now they use it with orchestras!<br/>    After this act the people of Anaphoria cut off all diplomatic relations<br/>with China until they forfeit the possession of the bells to Anaphoria or one<br/>of its allies. At  that time it will be  retuned back to its original tuning.</p><p>    Anyone who has played a scale with equally spaced notes would realize<br/>that the scale at least approximates a subharmonic series if not an outright<br/>subharmonic series. Looking at the cent measurements are interval sizes<br/>closer to slendro (I am not saying it is slendro). I chalk up the article to<br/>NATURE magazine being the victim of CHINESE PROPAGANDA.</p><p>weekswyl wrote:</p><p>&gt; From: &quot;weekswyl&quot; &lt;<a href="mailto:weekswyl@nbnet.nb.ca">weekswyl@nbnet.nb.ca</a>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Hi, colleagues:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;      I read with great interest the excerpts passed on by Greenwich on the<br/>&gt; 9000-year-old Chinese flute --- with passing reference to the Neaderthal<br/>&gt; one.

Are<br/>&gt;they cultural selections of 5 of the possible diatonic intervals?</p><p>I think they result from inserting a melodic third into each open fourth of<br/>a &quot;tetrachordal&quot; framework.

More complex intervals are beyond what can be<br/>audibly gleaned from melody alone.</p></div><h3>Paul H.
