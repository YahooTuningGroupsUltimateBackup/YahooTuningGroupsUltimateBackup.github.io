This is very helpful.</p><p>However, I did have one small question.  If the &quot;xeno&quot; tunings really<br/>use Pythagorean with two keyboard octaves separated by a comma, why are<br/>they so &quot;xeno?&quot;  Doesn&apos;t that imply &quot;foreign&quot; or &quot;strange??&quot;  It sounds<br/>like that procedure is basically illustrating the performance practices<br/>of the Medieval period.  Or is it, perhaps, just the fact that the<br/>tuning is systemized in this way... and it wasn&apos;t so defined as such at<br/>that time (??)</p><p>The &quot;neo-Gothic&quot; most certainly makes sense, but I was personally<br/>thinking more along the lines of using the various altered Pythagoreans<br/>to construct new music, not necessarily reflective of the Medieval<br/>period.  A good example of the later, I believe, would be the Charles<br/>Wuorinen &quot;Percussion Concerto&quot; which, consciously, evokes and perhaps<br/>quotes Medieval music.  (Well, OK, it might be Renaissance, too... I<br/>can&apos;t recall).</p><p>All this stuff is certainly more exciting than the corresponding<br/>Medieval courses I, myself, took back in the dark age!</p><p>___________ _____ __ _<br/>Joseph Pehrson</p></div>
