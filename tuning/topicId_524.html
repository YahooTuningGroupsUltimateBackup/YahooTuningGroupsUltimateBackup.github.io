I find it more emotionally arousing and gripping.  People<br/>have told me that they like to play such music to wake up to.  There are<br/>situations where a person might definitely prefer to have equal temperament<br/>music playing, even though in other situations they would prefer music<br/>in more consonant tuning.</p><p>&#x9;What I&apos;ve said here leaves the whole matter of the myriad different flavors<br/>of<br/>slight dissonance provided by different equal temperaments and by the vast<br/>number<br/>of non equal temperament slightly dissonant tunings unaddressed, but I&apos;m<br/>trying to<br/>say something constructive in this area, because I&apos;ve seen people expressing<br/>such<br/>diametrically opposed views about differently tuned performances that it&apos;s<br/>hard<br/>to believe until one sees it.</p><p>&#x9;I will say, however, that I have heard disparaging comments about just<br/>intonation, which I&apos;ve been working with since 1980, to the effect that it<br/>really<br/>isn&apos;t all that much different than equal temperament and that the real future<br/>of<br/>music lies in the more far out equal temperaments.  I believe that these<br/>remarks<br/>are completely unfounded and that consonance is a key psychological parameter<br/>in<br/>music which for many people greatly affects its psychological impact,<br/>regardless<br/>of the cent values of various differences in pitch involved.  I believe we<br/>need to<br/>be open about all these matters and try to really understand the truth of what<br/>is<br/>happening neurophysiologically and psychologically, and although fascinating<br/>research in these areas is beginning to be done, there is a great deal which<br/>is as<br/>yet not understood, and there are great differences between individuals and<br/>even<br/>between different states in the same individual at different times.</p><p>&#x9;Dave Hill,     La Mesa, CA</p></div><h3>D.

The idea of just intonation allows<br/>for a potentially infinite variety of tones and tonal relationships that<br/>can be understood in terms of ratios.  But both seem to be simply  ways of<br/>quantifying sounds, sounds which ultimately have a form outside any<br/>description that math or words can provide.  Statements such as &quot;I agree<br/>that the intimate immensity of simply two intervals in just intonation (to<br/>me) say the simplest--1/1 &amp; 7/4 or 1/1 &amp; 3/2...to be held for a long<br/>time... are much more psychologically and neurologically not to mention<br/>politically more significant (again to me) than any amount of equal temp.&quot;<br/>seem outrageous to me.  Anytime someone says that one thing is better or<br/>more significant than another (psychologically, neurologically and<br/>politically?), it sounds like someone is selling something.  &quot;...simpler<br/>and accessible to common folks who desire a purity not only in music but in<br/>their culture, society and psychological relationships to their fellow<br/>women and men&quot; - sounds like political rhetoric (I know what the common<br/>people need, these simple folk need pure intervals - this will benefit them<br/>neurologically!)
