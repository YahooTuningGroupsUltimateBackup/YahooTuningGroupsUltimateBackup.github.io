Partials with nodal circles far from the<br/>striking &gt;point will be heard loudly. In this way one can observe that the<br/>hum tone, prime, tierce, nominal, twelfth, &gt;double-octave, etc. will be<br/>dominant in the spectrum. Interesting is that this sequence gives a relative<br/>tone &gt;scale c - c1 - es1 - c2 - g2 - c3 (C3 - C4 - E4b - C5 - G5 - C6),<br/>which is very acceptable.</p><p>In ratios, this might be 5:10:12:20:30:40, or 1/24:1/12:1/10:1/6:1/4:1/3</p><p>So it looks like you did some octave fudging.</p><p>But what&apos;s the perceived main pitch of the bell? It&apos;s C! This shows that the<br/>timbre is not heard as an undertone series but simply as</p><p>1:2:4:6:8</p><p>with an &quot;extraneous&quot; Eb that adds inharmonic interest to the tone, and,<br/>according to the article, is a consequence of the bell&apos;s general shape:</p><p>&quot;One can vary the slope of the bell profile, the height or diameter of the<br/>bell, and so forth. This means that the designer can do something about<br/>internal relationships within a group. But one cannot expect too much, for<br/>experience shows us that to conserve the harmonic structure of the lowest<br/>partials, a variation of 4% in frequency is maximum. As a consequence, the<br/>major third bell, with partial I-3 a major third above the prime, has not<br/>yet been realized, in spite of the claims of certain bell founders. Also it<br/>is not possible to make the interval between I-3 and I-4 a perfect octave&quot;</p><p>Furthermore, the article states:</p><p>&quot;The essentially nonharmonic spectrum of the bell has been made quite<br/>acceptable in this way, for it is the dominant overtones that reinforce the<br/>tuned pitch of the bell.&quot;</p><p>This agrees with what I&apos;m saying -- we essentially hear otonally, so the<br/>more otonal characteristics can be tuned into the bell&apos;s spectrum, the<br/>better.</p></div><h3><a id=20785 href="#20785">ðŸ”—</a>Paul H.

Correctly<br/>then, the musicians state that the minor third should be as weak as<br/>possible.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Apart from the question of whether this is possible or not, one has to<br/>consider seriously that the nodal circles of the other partials of group I<br/>would be shifted down by approximately the same degree. However, it is<br/>exactly in this group that the bell sound finds a strong basis for<br/>unambiguous tonal height.&quot;</p><p>Unambiguous tonal height is what I&apos;ve been talking about, Robert, and it&apos;s a<br/>sensation that can only be given by a harmonic series.</p><p>&quot;Thus, a weaker third opposes the production of a strong tonal height<br/>sensation for the bell; it is clear in such a choice what we would prefer.&quot;</p><p>What the author is saying here is that, due to the physics of bell<br/>vibrations, weakening the minor third would necessarily weaken other<br/>frequencies which are, in fact, at or near harmonic overtones of the<br/>perceived main pitch. So as much as musicians might wish to eliminate the<br/>&quot;extraneous&quot; minor third from the bell&apos;s spectrum, bell-makers can&apos;t do so<br/>without adversely affecting many of the bell&apos;s &quot;correct&quot; partials.</p></div><h3><a id=20786 href="#20786">ðŸ”—</a>Robert Walker &#x3C;robert_walker@rcwalker.freeserve.co.uk&#x3E;</h3><span>4/6/2001 1:25:39 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Hi Paul,</p><p>Yes, looking at the article, it seems that bell tuners are actually trying to<br/>approximate the otonal sequence as closely as possible.</p><p>However, at least in the 17th century, they ended up instead with<br/>1/12: 1/6: l/5: 1/4: 1/3</p><p>and the 1/5 is there because they can&apos;t get rid of it!</p><p>I&apos;m not clear from the article about whether modern bell<br/>tuners also target this sequence.</p><p>I wonder if a bell with a major instead of a minor third<br/>would still sound like a bell?
