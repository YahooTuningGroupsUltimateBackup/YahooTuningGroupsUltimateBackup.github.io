Any of you play on scalloped fretboards?</p><p>LucyTuning is fine.  You imply cover bands above.  To get standards<br/>right the obvious thing is to go for a meantone.  LucyTuning is such.<br/>19 frets per octave (fpo) will work for all the common keys.<br/>(Actually 17 fpo is enough but you may as well round up to get a more<br/>equal fretting.)  The chords will sound purer than 12-equal.  Because<br/>it&apos;s a meantone you won&apos;t have to worry about comma shifts.  Rock/pop<br/>doesn&apos;t tend to require a closed cycle of fifths.  It has the virtue<br/>that the 19 frets are relatively equally spaced so there are fewer<br/>horror chords out of those playable.  But there are also fewer feather<br/>beds.  You can go for more frets in such a way that they may be<br/>difficult to play, but in the worst case you can safely ignore them.</p><p>You talk about high harmonics above.  LucyTuning isn&apos;t so good for<br/>this.  7 chords come out two different ways.  One is the logical<br/>extended 5-limit tuning.  The other approximates the harmonic series<br/>chunk 4:5:6:7.  Sometimes you have a choice of which to play.  The<br/>7-limit version is closer than in 12-equal, but still a long way out,<br/>and you can improve this with a different fretting.</p><p>I chose something closer to quarter-comma meantone for my guitar (a<br/>strat copy).  The 5-limit chords are theoretically purer although I<br/>don&apos;t think that matters.  The 7-limit seventh chords are much closer<br/>to just and that does make them smoother.  There are also some tenuous<br/>11-limit chords that exist.</p><p>It is harder to play than regular fretting for some chords.  For<br/>example, an A requires you to shove three fingers between narrowly<br/>spaced frets on consecutive strings.  I got it working but it&apos;s more<br/>restrictive.  It should be less of a problem with LucyTuning or a<br/>classical guitar, where I believe the neck is wider near the nut.</p><p>I think 12 fpo would actually be fine for playing in G.  It&apos;d make the<br/>A (as V/V) easier.  But it also means you can&apos;t go far outside G.  Not<br/>only are some notes not there but you can&apos;t even bend up to them.  As<br/>there&apos;s plenty of stuff to play in G this is a viable option but it<br/>does restrict your repertoire.</p><p>One thing I&apos;ve thought about for converting experienced guitarists is<br/>a fretting around 1/6-comma meantone.  Maybe 17fpo, or 12fpo with the<br/>first fret doubled.  It wouldn&apos;t be much harder to play than standard<br/>and the simple chords would still be tuned better.  Because the fifths<br/>are better a lot of guitar logic would make more sense.  And because<br/>it&apos;s closer to 12-equal there wouldn&apos;t be such a problem playing with<br/>traditionally tuned instruments.  But the narrowly spaced frets are<br/>narrower so perhaps that&apos;d be a problem.</p><p>To other ideas -- these tend to be either equal temperaments or JI.<br/>I&apos;ve never been convinced by the logic for an equal temperament.  You<br/>can play in all keys but guitarists tend to stick to the easy ones<br/>anyway.  You still can&apos;t use a capo because with the frets closer<br/>together the tension gets to high if you bend the string right to the<br/>fretboard.  (At least, I couldn&apos;t get this to work.)  Still, some<br/>people like their equal temperaments.</p><p>As for JI, there are people who do it, but it restricts the<br/>repertoire.  You maybe happy with comma shifts but sometimes you have<br/>to do without an open string because it&apos;s a comma out from what you<br/>want.  That said, I have a book of songs that only use G, C, D, and<br/>Em.  I think they&apos;d work fine in JI.  It depends on whether you want a<br/>microtonal fretting to only play 4 chords ;-)</p><p>I&apos;m looking at a fretting using magic temperament.  I think it would<br/>work but, like JI, not with standards.  It doesn&apos;t even look right<br/>with a variant of the standard open string tuning.  As I haven&apos;t<br/>implemented it I can&apos;t say how it sounds.  If you&apos;re interested I can<br/>give more details.

That&apos;s another reason I think a fretting based on 1/5- or<br/>1/6-comma meantone would really make sense provided you don&apos;t want<br/>7-limit chords.  It&apos;d be easier to play for most practical chords than<br/>1/4-comma while being purer than 12-equal and not so far away to<br/>frighten the horses.</p><p>                           Graham</p></div><h3><a id=78920 href="#78920">ðŸ”—</a>Jack &#x3C;gvr.jack@...&#x3E;</h3><span>11/2/2008 9:35:21 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Graham, thank you very much for your detailed answer.
