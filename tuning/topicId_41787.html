Under the banner SO<br/>INCLINED, multi-saxophonist Mike Ellis, &quot;prepared&quot; pianist Joshua Pierce, and<br/>contrabassoonist/bassoonist Johnny Reinhard join together for an evening of<br/>exciting acoustic richness with a polymicrotonal bent.</p><p>Saturday, March 8th features the Flux Quartet performing five string<br/>quartets: Wendy Carlos receives a first performance for her rather<br/>traditionally tuned FAVORITE PLACES. Charles Ives&apos;s STRING QUARTET #2 is<br/>heard for the first time in Ives&apos;s idealized tuning of extended Pythagorean.<br/>Composer Johnny Reinhard offers TRESPASS in harmonic-17 tuning (where every<br/>scale note is made of a ratio containing a multiple of the 17th harmonic for<br/>maximum &quot;17-ness&quot;).
