Harry Partch, who generally used tablatures of<br/>&gt; his own devising, did notate modified keyboard instruments this way for<br/>&gt; performance.</p><p>Thanks, Graham for your commentary.  Yes, of course, I figured many<br/>people had tried this approach.  It seems sensible to me.</p><p>Me:<br/>&gt; &gt; LATER, I will do the &quot;translation&quot; process of figuring out what the<br/>&gt; &gt; 12-tET notes really are.  Why do I have to do this?? Well, the answer is<br/>&gt; &gt; obvious, unless one is strictly writing electronic music which, I<br/>&gt; &gt; personally believe, should never be notated unless it is accompanying<br/>&gt; &gt; other live instruments.</p><p>Graham B.:<br/>&gt; Translate to 12-tET?  The very thought of it!  And electronic music should<br/>&gt; never be notated?  I disagree there as well.  Partly because somebody else may<br/>&gt; need to understand it one day.  Or you might even need to convert it to use a<br/>&gt; different synthesizer.  Or live, electronic instruments may be accompanying<br/>&gt; each other.</p><p>Well... I know for the xenharmonic set I have committed a sacrilege.<br/>However, most of our &quot;traditional&quot; instrumentalists who aren&apos;t<br/>&quot;xenharmonic cultists&quot; as we are, still use 12-tET as a reference.  My<br/>god, they still complain about 1/4 tones... I&apos;m not joking!</p><p>Your case for notation of electronic music is well taken.  I guess it<br/>depends what one is trying to do in that genre.  I can certainly see its<br/>significance in your own approach.</p><p>JP:<br/>&gt; &gt; All we need to do is find the 1/1, which is Scala is always &quot;middle C&quot;<br/>&gt; &gt; or 261.63HZ.<br/>GB:<br/>&gt; I think you&apos;ll find that Scala chooses the 1/1 at &quot;middle C&quot; such that A is 440<br/>&gt; Hz.  Unless you tell it otherwise.<br/>&gt;<br/>Thanks for that tip.  I just also read the note from Manuel Op de Coul<br/>which helps a lot...</p><p>GB:<br/>&gt; I think there<br/>&gt; is some evidence that performers do find the 12-tET with cent deviations<br/>&gt; easier,</p><p>I will stick my neck out here and say that I would believe it would be<br/>unequivocably easier for traditional, professional performers, and they<br/>are the cattle that I am particularly interested in, at the moment.<br/>I&apos;ve enjoyed all the other xenharmonic notation I have been reading<br/>about... notation by commas, etc., but I really feel this is for<br/>xenharmonic specialists...</p><p>&gt; There&apos;s stuff on my website about this.  Try<br/>&gt; <a href="http://www.microtonal.co.uk/schismic.htm">http://www.microtonal.co.uk/schismic.htm</a></p><p>Yes... your website is one of the best around... and you really are<br/>interested in &quot;educating&quot; people, not obfuscating...</p><p>&gt; Anything that gets you away from 12-thinking would be good.  1/8-tones sound<br/>&gt; like a generally bad idea for this.</p><p>Johnny Reinhard specifically REQUESTED 1/8 tone tuning for his piece and<br/>he&apos;s a MICROTONAL SPECIALIST!!  That just shows us how far we have to go<br/>in order to get traditional perfomers to do this stuff.  Johnny and I<br/>don&apos;t even have a completed set of woodwind fingerings for 1/8 tones,<br/>much less anything extremely exotic.  My presumption is that the<br/>woodwinds are going to be about the hardest of all to &quot;convert&quot; just<br/>because of all the fingering problems...</p><p>Thanks, Graham for all your comments.  They are greatly appreciated!</p><p>___________ ______ ___ __ _<br/>Joseph Pehrson</p></div>
