The same is also the case where the B in Huzzam has to be a pure fourth lower than this very E. The pitches of Suz-i Dilara, which is a terkib and not a maqam according to Abdulbaki Nasr Dede of the 19th century, are nothing other than what one finds in a pythagorean major scale.</p><p>As to your second question, maqam music instruments are retuned every time a new fasl is chosen. The general inclination is to select a Ney Aneng, which is actually the diapason the musicians feel comfortable with (such as Rast=195Hz, Mansur), and then they make the proper calibrations to the string tensions. However, if a certain open string happens to be a vital pivot of a certain scale which does not conform to a pure fifth with the lower or higher open string, then the musician might feel the need to temper this fifth, not depending on the fifth, but depending on the interval between the tonic and the pivot.</p><p>Cordially,<br/>Ozan<br/>  ----- Original Message -----<br/>  From: Yahya Abdal-Aziz<br/>  To: <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a><br/>  Sent: 23 Nisan 2005 Cumartesi 11:21<br/>  Subject: [tuning] Re: 29tET</p><p>  ________________________________________________________________________<br/>  [YA]  It&apos;s this sort of _practical_ information<br/>  on tuning that I find of most musical interest on<br/>  this list.  Thank you!</p><p>  To clarify, do you mean that violinists will tune their<br/>  instruments with E at 5/4 for Rast, but at 81/64<br/>  for Suz-i-Dilara?</p><p>  More generally, will they retune their instruments<br/>  for different maqama?</p><p>  Regards,<br/>  Yahya</p></div>
