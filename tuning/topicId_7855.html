See, I believe the keyboard<br/>&gt; has had no small impact on music as we know it -- in fact, I believe it<br/>&gt; gave birth to western music.  What I&apos;m saying is, I doubt there will<br/>&gt; ever<br/>&gt; be a serious genre of music based on retuned halberstadts.  If somebody<br/>&gt; proves me wrong on that, I certainly wouldn&apos;t complain, but...</p><p>I don&apos;t know if a genre should really be based on an interface.  Although<br/>I suppose rock music is based around the guitar.  I think we already have<br/>serious genres based around sequencers.  Also, a lot of music based on<br/>ensemble playing.  An extended mapping for a 2-rank keyboard could take<br/>it&apos;s place in the ensemble or the studio.  Maybe this would only be a<br/>temporary measure before the take-over of Bosanquet keyboards.  I wouldn&apos;t<br/>count on it.  Adaptive tuning looks far more populist.  And some of &quot;what<br/>made the Halberstadt so good&quot; wouldn&apos;t transfer to a Bosanquet.</p><p>I see an extended keyboard mapping as taking the place of a woodwind<br/>instrument, rather than a conventional keyboard.  In both cases you need<br/>two hands to cover a tune, and you have direct control of expression.<br/>Although with an extended keyboard you can still play chords.  Lots of<br/>them.  Real-time pitch bending is also an option, but I find it preferable<br/>to have lots of fixed pitches, either on a keyboard or a guitar.</p><p>Do &quot;retuned halberstadts&quot; include 12-note octave retunings?</p><p>&gt; Like it or not, serious keyboard music is played &quot;live&quot;.</p><p>What a strange assertion.  Is this true of some, most or all such music?</p><p>&gt; The ability for<br/>&gt; one person to control a large number of resources in real time with his<br/>&gt; hands is not a small deal.  It forces a certain understanding of music.</p><p>Fair enough, and applies to all mappings under consideration.</p><p>&gt; Serious keyboards (ones that are up for consideration as a standard) are<br/>&gt; expected to do a wide variety of things -- like rehearsing a choir.  You<br/>&gt; simply cannot rehearse a choir in JI with a halberstadt.</p><p>Hmm.  &quot;Up for consideration as a standard&quot; suggests I wasn&apos;t taking your<br/>&quot;seriously&quot; seriously enough.  I wouldn&apos;t begin to suggest that a<br/>(modified) Halberstadt with 19, 22, 24 or 29 notes to the octave should<br/>replace the 12 note variety.  It would be inconsistent to do so, because<br/>the majority of my keyboard playing time is spent with 12 (unequal) notes<br/>to the octave.  But there are serious alternatives.</p><p>As for rehearsing a choir, I haven&apos;t a clue.  If singers expected an<br/>instrument that played the notes they were trying to sing, 12 to the<br/>octave wouldn&apos;t be enough.  But obviously expectations are colored by<br/>experience.</p><p>&gt; &gt;A diminished triad contains two minor thirds.  Either could be<br/>&gt; subminor,<br/>&gt; &gt;and with the right keyboard you can try all three versions to see which<br/>&gt; &gt;you want.  And do that really easily.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; And how would the ability to [reach?] an octave prohibit this choice?</p><p>Being able to play an octave is certainly a Good Thing(tm).  But only<br/>having 12 notes within it would mean they don&apos;t include all the notes you<br/>want -- unless you had remarkable foresight when you did the tuning.</p><p>&gt; &gt;Sure, if you&apos;ve got one.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I&apos;m saying there are good reasons to get one!  That it is worth the<br/>&gt; effort.<br/>&gt;  And the expense is not prohibitive!  How could anybody believe such a<br/>&gt; thing?  Do you drive a car?  Live under a roof?  Use a PC?</p><p>There are good reasons to get a Bosanquet keyboard, and reasons why the<br/>expense is too great.  But even if you were to buy/build one, I wouldn&apos;t<br/>expect it too be as playable as a Halberstadt right away.  It needs time<br/>to evolve, along with a playing style.</p><p>Now I&apos;ve got a house, my next priority is to get my own PC, and then Kyma.<br/> I&apos;m hoping that will make it easier to produce the music I want.<br/>Keyboards are a secondary issue.  I&apos;ll probably go for that Fatar<br/>semi-weighted job you say is so good: you&apos;d better be right!</p><p>The MicroZone is $7500 for 810 keys.  If that were cost-per-key, then the<br/>128 keys you can actually get from MIDI would only cost $1200 by my<br/>calculations.  That would be a serious proposition.  But I don&apos;t have the<br/>time to build my own right now.  And an 810 key monstrosity certainly<br/>isn&apos;t worth getting into debt for.  And no, I don&apos;t drive a car.</p><p>&gt; What I insist upon, to be clear, is to be able to reach  at<br/>&gt; least the interval of equivalence with a single hand.  As it is, much<br/>&gt; beautiful music would be lost by making the halberstadt bigger so that,<br/>&gt; say, Oscar Peterson could reach _only_ an octave.</p><p>But there&apos;s a lot of beautiful music that can&apos;t be made without reaching<br/>inside the semitone.  If I had Oscar Peterson&apos;s talent I&apos;d be able to<br/>demonstrate that.  As it is, I can at least see the potential.  The<br/>smallest and largest intervals you can choose are both limitations.  I<br/>don&apos;t insist on anything: I make the best use of what I&apos;ve got, and make<br/>different compromises at different times.</p><p>Still, this is only personal preferences we&apos;re discussing.  You can go on<br/>dreaming of your Bosanquet while the rest of the world goes on in the firm<br/>belief that there are only 12 notes to the octave.  Then we&apos;ll all be<br/>happy.</p></div><h3>Carl Lumma &#x3C;clumma@nni.com&#x3E;</h3><span>1/18/2000 11:07:45 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>[Graham Breed wrote...]<br/>&gt;An extended mapping for a 2-rank keyboard could take it&apos;s place in the<br/>&gt;ensemble or the studio.</p><p>That was Partch&apos;s approach.

You can&apos;t satisfy both<br/>at once, by definition (unless your basic scale is equal-step, in which<br/>case it doesn&apos;t really have modes).  The halberstadt has M.I.  Both major<br/>and minor thirds are thirds, on balance the same width.

But I&apos;d much rather use (and listen to) a wind controller.</p><p>&gt;&gt;If the instrument in question is a sequencer hooked up to a N-ORRH,<br/>&gt;&gt;music made on it may be clever, or not.  But it&apos;s no longer keyboard<br/>&gt;&gt;music,  it&apos;s sequenced-N-ORRH music.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;Aaaaaaahhhhhhhhhh!!!!!!!!!  So serious keyboard music is played live<br/>&gt;because, if it isn&apos;t live, it isn&apos;t keyboard music!</p><p>That&apos;s right.  [If live means &quot;in realtime&quot;.]</p><p>&gt;A non-octave reachable retuned Halberstadt won&apos;t replace the standard<br/>&gt;article.  But there&apos;s so much music -- well, most that uses synthesizers<br/>&gt;-- that doesn&apos;t rely on polyphonic playing.</p><p>Ick.</p><p>&gt;&gt;The choir is just one example.  The use of a Bosanquet or multi-rank<br/>&gt;&gt;keyboard could change everything.  Orchestras could play Stravinsky in<br/>&gt;&gt;15-limit JI all the time, not just under the freakish circumstances that<br/>&gt;&gt;must have existed the day they recorded Deutsche Grammophon 437-850-2.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;15-limit JI is asking a lot of any two-dimensional keyboard.</p><p>Tell that to Erv Wilson!  [Even a plain diamond works quite well -- even<br/>those who don&apos;t like Norman Henry&apos;s music seldom complain about his skill<br/>at the diamond keyboard.]</p><p>&gt;Well, it depends what you&apos;d use it for.  I&apos;m making sequenced music in my<br/>&gt;spare time, and keyboards aren&apos;t really that important.  Having a more<br/>&gt;versatile one wouldn&apos;t make much, if any, difference to the music.  If<br/>&gt;you&apos;re playing live, and need the extra notes, you need the keyboard,<br/>&gt;provided your budget stretches to it.</p><p>Just to be sure, I&apos;d like to say again that none of my remarks are meant to<br/>discourage anyone from making sequenced music!  I can&apos;t stress that enough!</p><p>&gt;That&apos;s a tempting offer, but without my house where would I put your PC?<br/>&gt;As for the CD, I&apos;m still confronted by the obstacle of not having a US<br/>&gt;bank account.</p><p>Graham, write me off list.

That&apos;s a keen observation -- it is one of the fatal flaws (IMO)<br/>&gt; of<br/>&gt; Erv&apos;s honeycomb design.</p><p>That&apos;s it, yes.</p><p>&gt; &gt;A  multi-rank keyboard needn&apos;t spoil that until you use the extra<br/>&gt; ranks.<br/>&gt; &gt;But once you do, it restricts your freedom of finger placement.  This<br/>&gt; isn&apos;t<br/>&gt; &gt;a fatal flaw, but it&apos;s something that will have to be overcome.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I&apos;m sorry, I don&apos;t follow.  Multi-rank keyboards with rectangular keys<br/>&gt; can<br/>&gt; preserve as much or as little perpendicular freedom as you&apos;d like.</p><p>How so?  You can get the second rank to overlap both the first and third,<br/>but the first and third can&apos;t overlap each other.  Otherwise you have the<br/>same restriction as a linear keyboard in terms of the number of notes per<br/>octave.  If you play a chord that covers more than two ranks, then your<br/>freedom gets restricted.  The limiting case is that rectangular keys an do<br/>the same simple scales as a fixed-pitch Halberstadt, but with mutliple<br/>transpositons.  The honeycomb design seems to give the biggest range of<br/>weird chords, not all of them playable with one hand.  Some compromise<br/>will have to be worked out, according to what composers and performers<br/>find they want.</p><p>&gt; &gt;The inherent simplicity of a linear keyboard is something that will<br/>&gt; always<br/>&gt; &gt;count for Halberstadt.  It all depends on whether or not you want those<br/>&gt; &gt;extra notes.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I don&apos;t follow the linear thing.  Multirank keyboards can still map<br/>&gt; pitch<br/>&gt; in a &quot;linear&quot; way, just in 2-D instead of 1-D.</p><p>If it&apos;s two-dimensional, it isn&apos;t a line, is it?</p><p>&gt; The big choice you have with any keyboard is that between<br/>&gt; transpositional<br/>&gt; invariance and what I will call modal invariance.  You can&apos;t satisfy<br/>&gt; both<br/>&gt; at once, by definition (unless your basic scale is equal-step, in which<br/>&gt; case it doesn&apos;t really have modes).  The halberstadt has M.I.  Both<br/>&gt; major<br/>&gt; and minor thirds are thirds, on balance the same width.  This is<br/>&gt; probably<br/>&gt; the way to go for generalized-diatonic scales -- you can play the basic<br/>&gt; chords without having to think.  You just get them &quot;under the fingers&quot;.<br/>&gt; But, you do have to bother to learn to play in all keys...</p><p>Hmm, I hadn&apos;t really thought about it that way.  Staff notation, and<br/>variations thereof, always hav modal invariance.  Although they&apos;re also<br/>good ways of writing for generalized keyboards.</p><p>I think the biggest choice is between melody and harmony.  Linear pitch<br/>ordering favours melody.  So do the &quot;traditional&quot; Bosanquet mappings,<br/>although having two dimensions helps as well.  Mouth organs, and I believe<br/>accordions, have harmonic mappings, where three consecutive notes are a<br/>triad.  The diamond marimba is another example.  A Wilson/Bosanquet<br/>keyboard could be mapped harmonically, and could be useful as such for<br/>complex, two-handed harmony, or as a dedicated left-hand keyboard.<br/>Guitars are an interesting compromise.  You have melody in one direction,<br/>and harmony in another.  (And those Ztars look *smart*.)</p><p>&gt; &gt;As for keyboards as melodic instruments, there are plenty of reasons:<br/>&gt; &gt;they&apos;re cheap, easily available, easy to play and give full MIDI<br/>&gt; control.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; You can do some cool stuff with a bend wheel and a monophonic patch, to<br/>&gt; be<br/>&gt; sure.  But I&apos;d much rather use (and listen to) a wind controller.</p><p>Now we have an argument as to whether or not a wind controller qualifies<br/>as a keyboard.</p><p>That aside, I don&apos;t know much about them.  I fact, I don&apos;t recall ever<br/>having seen one.  Looks like they&apos;re not as easily available as keyboards.<br/> They look like very useful MIDI input devices, but don&apos;t have enough keys<br/>for the kind of microtonality we&apos;re talking about.  How would one compare<br/>to a keyboard with breath control?  Assuming a player with no previous<br/>experience.</p><p>Incidentally, while on my travels, I found this site:</p><p><a href="http://www.yamahasynth.com/">http://www.yamahasynth.com/</a></p><p>which has electronic copies of Yamaha manuals.  I think somebody said<br/>recently that they don&apos;t have the manual for their TX81Z.  If that person<br/>is on this list, I hope you find that link useful.</p><p>Now I have a DX21 manual, I see this warning:</p><p>&quot;Do not open the cabinet or attempt to make your own repairs or<br/>modifications to any part of the instrument.  Such actions may not only<br/>result in electrical shock or damage, but will also void the product<br/>warranty.  Refer all servicing to a qualified Yamaha service center.&quot;</p><p>So, looks like I was dicing with death when I reconfigured that keyboard!</p><p>&gt; &gt;15-limit JI is asking a lot of any two-dimensional keyboard.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Tell that to Erv Wilson!  [Even a plain diamond works quite well -- even<br/>&gt; those who don&apos;t like Norman Henry&apos;s music seldom complain about his<br/>&gt; skill<br/>&gt; at the diamond keyboard.]</p><p>Well, I might do ...</p><p>Trying out the fingerings in the Xenharmonikon diagrams, it looks like<br/>11-limit chords could be played, but only with both hands.  So it&apos;s<br/>useful, but I don&apos;t think it&apos;s a panacea for 15-limit harmony.  Although<br/>you certainly could play 15-limit chords easily, they may not be the ones<br/>the choir should be singing.</p><p>A diamond would do better (8x8?) provided it&apos;s tuned to the right 1/1.</p><p>Who&apos;s Norman Henry?</p></div>
