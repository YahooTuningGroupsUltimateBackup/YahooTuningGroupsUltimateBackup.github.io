Paul Erlich posted the 21 note scale earlier, but to save you<br/>looking back, here it is again:</p><p>0.000<br/>33.333<br/>116.667<br/>150.000<br/>233.333<br/>266.667<br/>350.000<br/>383.333<br/>466.667<br/>500.000<br/>583.333<br/>616.667<br/>700.000<br/>733.333<br/>816.667<br/>850.000<br/>933.333<br/>966.667<br/>1050.000<br/>1083.333<br/>1166.667</p><p>It&apos;s not that difficult.  If you can find the degrees of 72-equal (not<br/>difficult either, it alternates 5 and 2 steps) put them in a spreadsheet<br/>and multiply each by 1200/72 or 50/3.</p><p>&gt; One possibility for the larger ensemble is to tune up sets of 5 to 6<br/>&gt; batphones (big pipes that you<br/>&gt; whack over the open end with a bat) within say a larger set of tones<br/>&gt; played on say a metallophone.<br/>&gt; That depends on whether the batphones give a clear enough timbre to<br/>&gt; tune up accurately.
