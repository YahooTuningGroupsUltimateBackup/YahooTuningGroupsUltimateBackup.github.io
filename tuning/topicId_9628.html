Just compare<br/>the terms in a simple lattice of 3&apos;s and 5&apos;s extending infinitely on either<br/>axis with a corresponding harmonic series: after the origin, each term in<br/>the former will be larger than the corresponding term in the latter.</p><p>Perhaps the more relevant points for Haverstick are that (1) most JI systems<br/>will be constructed from relatively small sets of generating intervals, each<br/>interval being audibly distinct, identifiable, and verifiable, and (2) the<br/>variety of musical contexts into which particular interval relationships may<br/>be audibly projected is unknown;  it is not true to say that a given<br/>interval is not perceptible so long as we still know so little about the<br/>modes and limits of musical production and reception.  La Monte Young&apos;s<br/>extended duration sound environments are examples of compositional<br/>innovation allowing previously unheard-of relationships to be made<br/>perceptible.</p><p>Daniel Wolf<br/><a href="http://home.snafu.de/djwolf/">http://home.snafu.de/djwolf/</a></p><p>&gt; Neil -- just intonation does not have to be thought of as being a<br/>&gt; represenation of the harmonic series. It can simply be thought of as a<br/>&gt; tuning system built up from the most acoustically blending intervals,<br/>which<br/>&gt; turn out to be simple ratios such as 3/2, 5/3, etc. Also, the infinite<br/>&gt; lattice Polychroni was referring to could simply be an infinite chain of<br/>&gt; 3/2s and 4/3s, or a 2-dimensional grid of 3/2s and 5/4s, or a 7-limit<br/>&gt; lattice, etc.; you don&apos;t need to go infinitely high in the harmonic series<br/>&gt; to get an infinite JI set of pitches. -- Paul<br/>&gt;</p></div><h3>Paul H.
