I shall try once more.</p><p>The effect is pure and obvious to me.  I already mentioned that when one of these 1/6 comma tritones is played, my ear fills in the phantom 9:8 above the lower note, and I get a three-note chord.  Well, it also fills in the phantom octave below that.  The tritone gives me a four-note chord, all in simple pure ratios.  The example was C-F#.  I hear the intervening D, and the D an octave below.  Counting up from the bottom, it&apos;s a pure 16:9 minor 7th, a pure 2:1 octave, and a pure 5:2 major 10th.</p><p>A spectrum analyzer is never going to hear this, or display it in numbers, because spectrum analyzers don&apos;t hear like specialists in 18th century harpsichord continuo.  Spectrum analyzers, and by extension the engineers who trust them more than the hearing of functional harmony, don&apos;t fill in phantom notes...even when the phantom notes are obvious.</p><p>Regular 1/6 syntonic comma meantone puts the F# exactly one syntonic comma below the point (relative to C) where it would be in Pythagorean: C-G-D-A-E-B-F#, less one syntonic comma.  That&apos;s why this is relevant. A naked tritone such as this, played on a regular 1/6 comma keyboard, gives that pure effect with pure and simple ratios...if one is able to hear these phantom notes completing the chord, thinking harmonically, with these notes being a right-hand continuo chord.  This is MUCH stronger an effect than any listening for beats way up at the 7th harmonic of the lower note.</p><p>I&apos;m no big fan of Kirnberger II, but it happens to have three of these chords exactly as I&apos;ve been describing: C-Bb-E, G-F-B, and D-C-F#.  The 7th is 16:9 and the 10th is 5:2.  The pure sound of these is obvious.  I hear the lower note of the tritone as the top of a 16:9, and the upper note as the top of a 5:2, both above the same (sometimes missing) bass note.</p><p>No, I&apos;m not going to provide an illustrative recording of this.  Anyone who wants to hear it is welcome to go set up a harpsichord and perceive it directly, which will make the point better anyway.  Enough members here have already bitched about the unwelcome sound quality of my YouTube instructional videos, focusing on the impure listening experience from a mediocre microphone instead of on the pedagogical points in them.  It ruins my motivation to make more of them with that camera.  Anyway, they&apos;re here for anybody who is willing to do harpsichord tuning by ear:<br/><a href="http://www-personal.umich.edu/~bpl/larips/videos.html">http://www-personal.umich.edu/~bpl/larips/videos.html</a></p><p>And now I&apos;m off for the rest of the day to go play a concert on a Flemish single with its bright overtones, and to make a recording on Tuesday on an Italian single that has stronger fundamentals.  I would be using regular 1/6 for its fabulous sound, except that some of the repertoire in our gig uses too many D#, A#, E#, and B#...and there won&apos;t be time to retune during the show.  So, I&apos;m using a compromise that has only most of the naturals in 1/6, and the other notes tastefully moderated.</p><p>Brad Lehman</p></div><h3>Paul Poletti &#x3C;paul@polettipiano.com&#x3E;</h3><span>2/17/2008 8:02:06 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;Carl Lumma&quot; &lt;carl@...&gt; wrote:</p><p>&gt;<br/>&gt; Have any spectrograms to show?  I doubt this is a very<br/>&gt; significant effect with harpsichords.</p><p>The formants of instruments like the harpsichord, fortepiano, and to a<br/>much lessor extent, the modern piano (because it has no bottom, and<br/>therefore no box, and also because -until recently- it was pretty much<br/>voiced to remove upper partials) are complex and due to lots of<br/>factors, among them box ressonances, soundboard response, and<br/>plucking/striking points. Since none of these characteristics are<br/>constants (not even strike point in modern pianos, regardless of what<br/>the books will tell you), formants are largely localized, appearing,<br/>disappearing, or shifting gradually as you move from one register to<br/>another. It is these very formants which give the instruments<br/>different registers, a quality which was valued in keyboard<br/>instruments until the Romantic era, when the aesthetic turned upside<br/>down and builders started trying to smooth everything out. It wasn&apos;t<br/>just in keyboard instruments, mind you, but generally in everything.<br/>During a lecture on the history of he klarinet some years back, Eric<br/>Hoeprich told the story of the first truly chromatic instrument, with<br/>keys that opened an ascending series of holes instead of merely<br/>producing the forked fingerings need on natural instruments, which<br/>cause marked tonal differences from note to note when you play a<br/>chromatic scale. The inventor, sometime around 1820 as I recall, went<br/>round demonstrating his instrument at the various conservatories of<br/>Europe, and the juries comments from the Paris conservatory are<br/>preserved, to wit: they found the invention most admirable, the only<br/>fault being that the instrument failed to produce the pleasing variety<br/>in the quality of the tones among the different tonalities.</p><p>Right, all that as means of introduction as to why modern musicians<br/>may have trouble acknowledging something which most early music types<br/>simply take for granted (including Brad, I&apos;m sure): string keyboard<br/>instruments - at least historic ones - have strong register<br/>differences. Now, as to spectrograms, I&apos;ve whipped up three for you,<br/>using the samples I mentioned from FreeSound.</p><p><a href="http://www.polettipiano.com/clave/AA-">http://www.polettipiano.com/clave/AA-</a>&gt;tenor_b.jpg</p><p>Blocks of repeated notes for the notes AA, D, F#, Bb, (tenor) d, g,<br/>and b. You can easily see the regions of resonance and damping, which<br/>generally remain more or less constant,rising slowly as pitch rises<br/>though by no means keeping up with the rise in fundamental frequency.<br/>The lowest anti-resonance, for example, starts at around 900 Hz and<br/>pretty much stays there. The next is at 1,5 kHz, rises a bit and then<br/>levels off at around 1,6 kHz. Above that there is another one at 2,4<br/>kHz, which also rises a bit and then more or less levels off. Without<br/>a note by note set of samples, it is hard to know exactly what is<br/>going on, but yo get the general picture.</p><p><a href="http://www.polettipiano.com/clave/d-g.jpg">http://www.polettipiano.com/clave/d-g.jpg</a></p><p><a href="http://www.polettipiano.com/clave/g-b.jpg">http://www.polettipiano.com/clave/g-b.jpg</a></p><p>These other two spectrograms demonstrate how these formants change the<br/>spectrum of  individual notes over the range of the instrument. In<br/>each case the left side of the screen shows repetitions of the first<br/>note in the file name, the right side repetitions of the second note<br/>in the file name. Just do some trace counting and you&apos;ll see that<br/>harmonics which are weak, missing, altogether, or very strong on one<br/>note may well be exactly the opposite on a note only a fourth or a<br/>third away. In both cases, you can easily see how it is the formants<br/>which are shaping the sound and not some aspect which retains the same<br/>position relative to the fundamental frequency.</p><p>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; Thus sometimes the 7th is indeed absent,<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Really?  Have any evidence of this?</p><p>Take a look at the spectrum of the note b. The 7th harmonic is almost<br/>totally absent, appearing only as a component of the first burst of<br/>sound right after the pluck, therefore of no value in tempering or<br/>tuning pure an interval. While you&apos;re at it, take a look at the<br/>spectrum for the g on the left. Note that the 5th harmonic is<br/>completely gone, as are all of its multiples; have fun tuning or<br/>tempering a major third with this note!</p><p>This is just the scientific proof for something that every<br/>professional tuner knows, something that Brad is being a bit<br/>disingenuous about; some intervals, even very simple ones like fifths,<br/>fourths, and thirds, are just nigh to impossible to tune/temper in<br/>some positions on every instrument. Try as you might, you just can&apos;t<br/>hear the beats you need to do the job. That&apos;s precisely because<br/>sometimes the harmonics which produce the beating just aren&apos;t there.<br/>No harmonics, no beats, it&apos;s that simple.</p><p>&gt;<br/>&gt; 45/32 has too many partials too close together for it to<br/>&gt; be beatless on a harpsichord.  Anyone who thinks I&apos;m wrong<br/>&gt; can have all the glory by posting a recording.</p><p>I agree with you completely. First of all, the chances that these<br/>harmonics are even present at any perceivable level are about as much<br/>as a snowball in hell, and even if they were there, as you say, the<br/>neighboring harmonics are so close that the ear can&apos;t suss &apos;em out.<br/>Generally speaking, anything above the 17th or 18th harmonic is too<br/>crowded for tuning by ear. That is not to say that mathematically pure<br/>intervals at higher ratios don&apos;t have unique sounds, only to say that<br/>it is not the same (psycho)acoustic mechanism as the normal harmonic<br/>congruence which gives simpler pure intervals there special character.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; Other<br/>&gt; &gt; things such as pitch level and even the weather can change things<br/>&gt; &gt; subtly (a crowned or flat soundboard changes its response).<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; But they can&apos;t make a 45/32 beatless.</p><p>On the contrary, if they suppress harmonics the harmonics that are<br/>beating at 45/32, it will indeed make it beatless. You can even do<br/>this with a major third. Take away 4 and 5 and all their multiples,<br/>and you can detune it until hell freezes over and yo won&apos;t hear any beats.</p><p>In any event, as I&apos;ve said, I doubt that 45 and 32 even exist in the<br/>sound of acoustical string instruments.

The lowest anti-resonance, for<br/>&gt; example, starts at around 900 Hz and pretty much stays there.<br/>&gt; The next is at 1,5 kHz, rises a bit and then levels off at<br/>&gt; around 1,6 kHz. Above that there is another one at 2,4<br/>&gt; kHz, which also rises a bit and then more or less levels off.<br/>&gt; Without a note by note set of samples, it is hard to know<br/>&gt; exactly what is going on, but yo get the general picture.</p><p>Though this isn&apos;t a very detailed spectrogram, I don&apos;t see<br/>much evidence of prominent formants.</p><p>&gt; <a href="http://www.polettipiano.com/clave/d-g.jpg">http://www.polettipiano.com/clave/d-g.jpg</a><br/>&gt; <a href="http://www.polettipiano.com/clave/g-b.jpg">http://www.polettipiano.com/clave/g-b.jpg</a><br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; These other two spectrograms demonstrate how these formants<br/>&gt; change the spectrum of individual notes over the range of<br/>&gt; the instrument. In each case the left side of the screen<br/>&gt; shows repetitions of the first note in the file name, the<br/>&gt; right side repetitions of the second note in the file name.<br/>&gt; Just do some trace counting and you&apos;ll see that harmonics<br/>&gt; which are weak, missing, altogether, or very strong on one<br/>&gt; note may well be exactly the opposite on a note only a fourth<br/>&gt; or a third away.

Or is<br/>it an effect which is &quot;purely&quot; personal, i.e. &quot;to him&quot;?  We can but<br/>wonder...), THE strongest argument for the 45/32 aug.4 being something<br/>of exceptional musical quality, is that by playing but two notes of<br/>any aug.4 in 1/6 mean, you get a double &quot;buy one get the second one<br/>free&quot; deal in that it automatically fills in the two notes which make<br/>the octave of the root of a dominant 7th chord which is a step (a pure<br/>step, mind you, 9/8, and not a mere Lehman &quot;pure&quot; step, but a PURE<br/>pure step, which is pure to everyone, effectively speaking,<br/>obviously... at least to me). This leaves Brad with several<br/>interesting dilemmas:</p><p>(1) Since the &quot;phantom&quot; note which gets filled in above the lower note<br/>of the +4 is in fact a pure whole tone (9/8), it must be a bitter pill<br/>to swallow indeed whenever one is actually required by the score to<br/>let these notes sound not by the conjuring-up of phantoms but rather<br/>by the mundane process of the mere depression of keys, beings as the<br/>interval which is actually produced by an instrument tuned in 1/6 mean<br/>ain&apos;t nuthin&apos; &apos;tall like that which dwelleth in the ears of Brad,<br/>being pure as it is.</p><p>(2) Going back to Brad&apos;s original message, pity the poor musician who<br/>hears like Brad and must play one of these &quot;spectacular&quot; dim7 chords;<br/>since they are indeed composed of &quot;two [Lehman-]pure tritones<br/>interlocked&quot;, and since he has established twice now that these &quot;pure&quot;<br/>tritones automatically imply the roots of dominant 7 chords, he must<br/>hear TWO superimposed dominant 7 chords. For example, if he were to<br/>play my example of F#-A-C-Eb, he would not only hear, as he himself<br/>has stated, the two D&apos;s which are phantom accomplices to the C-F#, but<br/>logically there would be no way to avoid hearing two F&apos;s, generated<br/>not by any process known to acoustical science but rather<br/>ectoplasmically by the spectacularly pure 45/32 aug4 Eb-A.</p><p>Brad DOES state that ectoplasmic voice leading only manifests when the<br/>+4ths appear &quot;nakedly&quot;, which begins to give the whole thing the kinky<br/>feel of one of those 1950&apos;s grade C made-for-the-drive-in-movies<br/>&quot;creature features&quot;, involving supernatural entities,<br/>extraterestrials, or mutant humanoids inevitably carrying-off<br/>scantly-clad beauties.

I already mentioned that when<br/>&gt; one<br/>&gt; &gt; of these 1/6 comma tritones is played, my ear fills in the phantom 9:8<br/>&gt; &gt; above the lower note, and I get a three-note chord.  Well, it also<br/>&gt; fills<br/>&gt; &gt; in the phantom octave below that.  The tritone gives me a four-note<br/>&gt; &gt; chord, all in simple pure ratios.  The example was C-F#.  I hear the<br/>&gt; &gt; intervening D, and the D an octave below.  Counting up from the bottom,<br/>&gt; &gt; it&apos;s a pure 16:9 minor 7th, a pure 2:1 octave, and a pure 5:2 major<br/>&gt; 10th.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; What just a gosh darn minute, here! Brad started all this by saying:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &quot;The diminished 7th chords are spectacular in regular 1/6 comma, since<br/>&gt; they&apos;re built of two pure tritones interlocked.&quot;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Evidently, whatever Brad meant then and still means by his peculiar<br/>&gt; use of the word &quot;pure&quot;, the effect was so compelling that he even<br/>&gt; posited that:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &quot;Maybe that strong sound contributed to the heavy use of diminished 7th<br/>&gt; chords by 18th century composers; or vice versa, their use of those is<br/>&gt; some evidence (perhaps weak, but there nonetheless) of a regular 1/6<br/>&gt; layout or something near it?&quot;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Now he wants us to believe that most compelling aspect of this<br/>&gt; mysterious &quot;purity&quot; which eludes us all, both conceptually and<br/>&gt; aurally, despite being an effect which is &quot;pure and obvious&quot; to him<br/>&gt; (not quite sure what THAT means - is &quot;pure&quot; the same as &quot;compelling&quot;?<br/>&gt; Or does it sound to Brad like what the rest of us call &quot;pure&quot;? Or is<br/>&gt; it an effect which is &quot;purely&quot; personal, i.e. &quot;to him&quot;?  We can but<br/>&gt; wonder...), THE strongest argument for the 45/32 aug.4 being something<br/>&gt; of exceptional musical quality, is that by playing but two notes of<br/>&gt; any aug.4 in 1/6 mean, you get a double &quot;buy one get the second one<br/>&gt; free&quot; deal in that it automatically fills in the two notes which make<br/>&gt; the octave of the root of a dominant 7th chord which is a step (a pure<br/>&gt; step, mind you, 9/8, and not a mere Lehman &quot;pure&quot; step, but a PURE<br/>&gt; pure step, which is pure to everyone, effectively speaking,<br/>&gt; obviously... at least to me). This leaves Brad with several<br/>&gt; interesting dilemmas:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; (1) Since the &quot;phantom&quot; note which gets filled in above the lower note<br/>&gt; of the +4 is in fact a pure whole tone (9/8), it must be a bitter pill<br/>&gt; to swallow indeed whenever one is actually required by the score to<br/>&gt; let these notes sound not by the conjuring-up of phantoms but rather<br/>&gt; by the mundane process of the mere depression of keys, beings as the<br/>&gt; interval which is actually produced by an instrument tuned in 1/6 mean<br/>&gt; ain&apos;t nuthin&apos; &apos;tall like that which dwelleth in the ears of Brad,<br/>&gt; being pure as it is.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; (2) Going back to Brad&apos;s original message, pity the poor musician who<br/>&gt; hears like Brad and must play one of these &quot;spectacular&quot; dim7 chords;<br/>&gt; since they are indeed composed of &quot;two [Lehman-]pure tritones<br/>&gt; interlocked&quot;, and since he has established twice now that these &quot;pure&quot;<br/>&gt; tritones automatically imply the roots of dominant 7 chords, he must<br/>&gt; hear TWO superimposed dominant 7 chords. For example, if he were to<br/>&gt; play my example of F#-A-C-Eb, he would not only hear, as he himself<br/>&gt; has stated, the two D&apos;s which are phantom accomplices to the C-F#, but<br/>&gt; logically there would be no way to avoid hearing two F&apos;s, generated<br/>&gt; not by any process known to acoustical science but rather<br/>&gt; ectoplasmically by the spectacularly pure 45/32 aug4 Eb-A.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Brad DOES state that ectoplasmic voice leading only manifests when the<br/>&gt; +4ths appear &quot;nakedly&quot;, which begins to give the whole thing the kinky<br/>&gt; feel of one of those 1950&apos;s grade C made-for-the-drive-in-movies<br/>&gt; &quot;creature features&quot;, involving supernatural entities,<br/>&gt; extraterestrials, or mutant humanoids inevitably carrying-off<br/>&gt; scantly-clad beauties. The question is, if these &quot;pure&quot; intervals are<br/>&gt; sooooo compelling when &quot;naked&quot;, how do they loose this quality when<br/>&gt; they are intimately intertwined with yet another compellingly-naked<br/>&gt; +4? My mind boggles! I would think the effect could not but be doubled<br/>&gt; thereby, perhaps even quadrupled!!<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Now, for those who want to hear what this might sound like, I&apos;ve<br/>&gt; whipped up a little audio file, dutifully following Brad&apos;s<br/>&gt; instructions to use a sound which has no harmonics above 6, 45/32 aug<br/>&gt; 4ths, and 9/8 seconds above the lower tone with an octave below that:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; <a href="http://www.polettipiano.com/faith_based_acoustics/purecluster.mp3">www.polettipiano.com/faith_based_acoustics/purecluster.mp3</a><br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Doesn&apos;t exactly remind me of anything I&apos;d expect from &quot;specialists in<br/>&gt; 18th century harpsichord continuo&quot;... more like Messian, actually.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Additionally, for those who want to try accompany Brad through his<br/>&gt; looking glass and into the alternative space-time continuo-um of the<br/>&gt; 18th century specialist, a magical world where the Evil Wicked Dr.<br/>&gt; Science with his monstrous Spectrum-o-thons is kept safely at bay,<br/>&gt; I&apos;ve posted another audio file of just (purely speaking) the 45/32 +4<br/>&gt; alone, sustained for a spell, and then followed by the mystical<br/>&gt; appearance of Our Lady of the Phantom Octave:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; <a href="http://www.polettipiano.com/faith_based_acoustics/indoctrinate_me.mp3">www.polettipiano.com/faith_based_acoustics/indoctrinate_me.mp3</a><br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Listen to it over and over again until you begin to hear the octave<br/>&gt; BEFORE it is actually played.

Are you by chance referring to the hard-hammer<br/>&gt; Young Chang sound that became fashionable in the &apos;90s?</p><p>I don&apos;t know when it changed because I don&apos;t like modern pianos and<br/>tend to stay away from them as much as possible. I do know that almost<br/>every recent piano I have met sounds harsh and nasty compared to the<br/>c.1900 instrument I am more comfortable with. Friends who are modern<br/>piano techs tell me this harsh sound has been growing in popularity<br/>for a decade or two, so that agrees with your date.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; are complex and due to lots of<br/>&gt; &gt; factors, among them box ressonances, soundboard response,<br/>&gt; &gt; and plucking/striking points. Since none of these<br/>&gt; &gt; characteristics are constants (not even strike point in<br/>&gt; &gt; modern pianos, regardless of what the books will tell you),<br/>&gt; &gt; formants are largely localized, appearing, disappearing,<br/>&gt; &gt; or shifting gradually as you move from one register to<br/>&gt; &gt; another.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Changes in spectra due to pluck/strike point differences<br/>&gt; aren&apos;t technically formants, but OK.</p><p>Well, the use of the word formant for describing things which affect<br/>the sound of musical instruments other than the voice is not entirely<br/>correct. Acousticians have borrowed the term from phonetics to<br/>describe those resonances of instruments which are relatively fixed<br/>and act as filters, much as real formants do. What I meant is that<br/>irregularities in pluck/strike point can interact with formants (be<br/>they air resonances or structural resonances) to create registers.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; It is these very formants which give the instruments<br/>&gt; &gt; different registers,<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I think the cause of registers is primarily the transition<br/>&gt; from wound to plain wire, and secondarily various<br/>&gt; nonlinearities in the relationship between string<br/>&gt; diameter/tension and playing force and hammer/plectrum<br/>&gt; coupling.</p><p>The overwhelming majority of instruments I am talking about have NO<br/>wound strings, so there is no transition. The also have but one<br/>bridge, so there is no transition from bass to treble bridge, another<br/>favorite of those who only know the modern piano. The standard<br/>literature, which makes much of out of string tension inconsistencies,<br/>is written by people who have no experience with the vast differences<br/>in stringing and scaling one encounters building and restoring<br/>harpsichords and early pianos, everything from exceedingly<br/>foreshortened scales all the way up to scales which remain Pythagorean<br/>for almost the entire instrument. This experience teaches one that<br/>most of what you read is largely much ado about nothing, and that the<br/>sort of realistic tension changes which can be accomplished are<br/>insufficient to produce any marked tonal differences. That said, gross<br/>aberrations, such as the current fad for exceptionally low tension<br/>among certain builders, can produce noticable tonal differences.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; But we&apos;re getting pretty distracted here.</p><p>Yes and no. The spectrum of a musical tone has a vast influence upon<br/>the sound of different tunings, as Bill Sethares has so aptly<br/>demonstrated.</p><p>&gt;<br/>&gt; Though this isn&apos;t a very detailed spectrogram, I don&apos;t see<br/>&gt; much evidence of prominent formants.</p><p>I&apos;m sure you see the black swaths of no or weak harmonics. The areas<br/>in between are obviously formants</p><p>&gt;<br/>&gt; I&apos;m not sure what we&apos;re seeing here, but it isn&apos;t going to<br/>&gt; render a 45/32 beatless, that&apos;s for sure.</p><p>These particular examples, no. I just wanted to demonstrate that any<br/>given harmonic can be totally absent from the mix, which is what you<br/>wondered about. It could just as well be the 7th, in which case any<br/>near-miss to a septimal pure interval will in fact be beatless. As I<br/>said, take out the 4 and 5th harmonics and their multiples, and even a<br/>Pythagorean major third is beatless.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Thus sometimes the 7th is indeed absent,<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; Really?  Have any evidence of this?<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; Take a look at the spectrum of the note b. The 7th harmonic<br/>&gt; &gt; is almost totally absent, appearing only as a component of<br/>&gt; &gt; the first burst of sound right after the pluck,<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Are we looking at the same images?</p><p>The correct image is g-b.jpg. The right side shows repeated plucks of<br/>the note b. In other word, the right half of the screen shows 11<br/>rapidly consecutive plucks of the note b, each about 3/4 of a second<br/>after the previous. Counting up from the bottom trace, which is the<br/>fundamental, the 4th harmonic is almost absent, being only the ghost<br/>of a trace. The 5th harmonic is rather strong aai, and the 6th is<br/>about as weak as the 4th. The 7th is very weak, appearing only very<br/>briefly at each moment of pluck, represented by a dashed trace. The<br/>9th harmonic is similar, though it last a fraction of a second longer.<br/>The 10th is also weak and dies quickly, though last longer than the<br/>9th. The 11th is relatively strong and constant again. 12 is weak and<br/>momentary. 13 is quite strong but dies rather fast, not quit lasting<br/>the 3/4 of a second or so of each sample. 14, 15, 16, and 17 are for<br/>all intents and purpose gone, though the can be faintly seen. Get it now?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; While you&apos;re at it, take a look at the<br/>&gt; &gt; spectrum for the g on the left. Note that the 5th harmonic is<br/>&gt; &gt; completely gone, as are all of its multiples; have fun tuning<br/>&gt; &gt; or tempering a major third with this note!<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; That I can see.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; This is just the scientific proof for something that every<br/>&gt; &gt; professional tuner knows, something that Brad is being a bit<br/>&gt; &gt; disingenuous about; some intervals, even very simple ones like<br/>&gt; &gt; fifths, fourths, and thirds, are just nigh to impossible to<br/>&gt; &gt; tune/temper in some positions on every instrument.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I&apos;ve only tuned 4 different harpsichords in my life, but I&apos;ve<br/>&gt; never had a problem.  They&apos;re a cinch to tune in JI.</p><p>I&apos;m talking about real tuning, no JI! Try tempering 1/6th mean by ear<br/>on a variety of Italians. Or setting the various Neidhardts, where the<br/>majority of intervals o must set are tempered. That will yo make aware<br/>of all sort of funkiness.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; The problem with 45/32 is that it no longer functions like a<br/>&gt; just interval.  You don&apos;t just remove the 45th and 32nd and<br/>&gt; its multiples, because it&apos;s not just the &apos;unisons&apos; that can beat.</p><p>Agreed completely. I think Brad is just completely out to lunch, as<br/>should be obvious by now. He lives and breathes and hears on the<br/>Planet of Brad.</p><p>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; In any event, as I&apos;ve said, I doubt that 45 and 32 even exist<br/>&gt; &gt; in the sound of acoustical<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; There&apos;s that word again.  Isn&apos;t it just &quot;acoustic&quot;?</p><p>According to Merriam Webster, acoustical is a variant of acoustic.<br/>What do I know? After 16 years of either using other&apos;s people&apos;s<br/>languages or using simplified English, mine has gone all to hell.</p><p>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; What does that mean? It&apos;s a harpsichord, man, a real one, and a<br/>&gt; &gt; historically based one at that. Whad-ya want, some turbo-charged<br/>&gt; &gt; overly bright synthesized fantasy harpsichord-like sound based<br/>&gt; &gt; on the tinkle-tinkle of a Neupert or a Sperrhake?<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; ;-)<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; :)  No, I just meant timbre changes from note to note sounded<br/>&gt; pretty mild to me, compared to say, what you&apos;ll hear on most<br/>&gt; pianos.</p><p>Yeah, that&apos;s one of the interesting things about acoustic(al)<br/>instruments. Given a set of samples like that, you think, it&apos;s all the<br/>same, more or less. But if you take any one sample and stuff it into a<br/>sampling synthesizer and play an octave of notes, you instantly<br/>recognize that it is fake precisely because it IS all the same. Then<br/>if you look at the spectrums of individual notes, you see how<br/>different they are, and you wonder why we accept it as even. It&apos;s just<br/>the same as how we recognize  vowel as that particular vowel even<br/>though the spectrum is drastically different when spoken by different<br/>people, or even by the same person at different pitches.</p><p>Interesting, that, and how it all feeds back onto tuning, since tuning<br/>by nature depends upon and assumes constant spectrum, something which<br/>never happens in the real world.</p><p>Ciao,</p><p>p</p></div><h3>Petr Par&#xED;zek &#x3C;p.parizek@chello.cz&#x3E;</h3><span>2/17/2008 1:19:44 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Ozan wrote:</p><p>&gt; I actually imagine to hear E-C-E-F#, not D-C-D-F# as Brad does.

The<br/>&gt; harmonic events are that strong and that pure. The phantom bass note<br/>&gt; is always (for me) at the major 3rd or 10th below one note (pure 5:4<br/>&gt; or 5:2), and at the pure 16:9 below the other.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Examples: if it&apos;s Bb-E being played in that spacing, I hear the C a<br/>&gt; 7th below the Bb and a 10th below the E. If it&apos;s E-Bb in that other<br/>&gt; inverted spacing, I hear the C a 3rd below the E and a 7th below the<br/>&gt; Bb. Pure beatless 16:9 and 5:2 (or 5:4) here!<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; And even if the temperament&apos;s actual version of the missing bass note<br/>&gt; is being played, somewhat off spot, the tritone inside the texture is<br/>&gt; still so strong by itself that it locks the whole chord into a similar<br/>&gt; effect.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Sure, I can go to each tritone in turn and stick my head inside the<br/>&gt; instrument, right next to the strings and soundboard. There,<br/>&gt; carefully, I can pick out beats of the upper harmonics for a short<br/>&gt; time. But at any normal listening distance at least half a meter away<br/>&gt; from the soundboard, all I hear is the purity of the tritone locking<br/>&gt; in its harmony. I hear that even in five-note or six-note chords: if<br/>&gt; there&apos;s a tritone in there anywhere, it makes incredible harmonic<br/>&gt; gravity all by itself. And if it&apos;s a fully-diminished 7th chord, with<br/>&gt; two tritones interlocked, that&apos;s a yet more powerful sound.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; By contrast, trying any of this in equal or in various irregular<br/>&gt; temperaments, it&apos;s just a muddled mess. No such clarity of focus that<br/>&gt; I hear from regular 1/6. I don&apos;t get that from regular 1/4 comma,<br/>&gt; either.

The interval is close enough to 2/1 to make the difference tones nicely noticeable. If it is really a 16/9, then the 16 is four octaves higher than the fundamental of 1 so you can quite easily hear if it&apos;s tuned correctly. I could also say that the 9 is close enough to 8 that I could spot the difference tone from the 8 even though an 8 is not there at all (if you ask why I chose to stretch the 16/9 to 16/8 and not 18/9, the answer is that 8/1 is an octave multiple while 18/1 is not). OTOH, if I listen to the same interval played with a very bright timbre somewhere in the lower octaves, what I notice almost immediately will be the fundamental cycle with the relative frequency of 1 -- this time not because of difference tones between the sounding 9 and a &quot;non-sounding&quot; 8 but because of the difference tones between the sounding upper harmonics, which is a completely different sound. - For another thing, if you hear a pair of tones of 360Hz and 640Hz, do you still call the 40Hz cycles &quot;beats&quot;?

Now as often encountered here, we have the<br/>&apos;paradox&apos; of JI: the sum or difference of two pure intervals remains<br/>JI, but need not be pure in any acoustically meaningful sense. (Some<br/>authors use &apos;pure&apos; to denote some 5-limit JI intervals regardless of<br/>their consonance or beating: such a purely formal/mathematical usage<br/>is acoustically meaningless.)</p><p>Thus 25/24, 32/27, 36/25, 81/64 and a whole host of other 5-limit<br/>intervals are in no way &apos;pure&apos;, despite being composed of just ratios.<br/>These intervals are close enough to 1/1, 6/5, 7/5, 5/4 that their<br/>beating is clearly audible (with minimal and reasonable assumptions<br/>about instrumental timbre).</p><p>So what I did last night was start (on the &apos;Flemish&apos; model<br/>harpsichord) with tenor d, tune pure M3 to f#, pure fifth to c#&apos; and<br/>fourth to g#&apos;. This creates a JI 45/32 between d and g#. And what<br/>happens? It beats. It is not pure. To me it just sounded like any old<br/>tempered tritone.

Now, what difference<br/>tones do you hear playing the same D-G# to C#-A resolution, all in<br/>regular 1/6 comma?</p><p>I hear a typical V7-I progression with an E bass (pure to both of D<br/>and G#) under the first one, and resolving to an A bass...with the C#<br/>slightly sharp of 5:4, of course.  The dominant 7th is stronger than<br/>the tonic resolution, which makes a nice tasteful decrescendo into the<br/>downbeat...on harpsichord!  As was normal in 18th century music,<br/>dissonances are supposed to be played more loudly than the consonances<br/>they resolve into.  And that&apos;s the effect I hear here, playing the<br/>D-G# tritone resolving normally into the C#-A 6th, with the phantom<br/>bass going V-I in A major under it.</p><p>Thanks,<br/>Brad Lehman</p></div><h3>Brad Lehman &#x3C;bpl@umich.edu&#x3E;</h3><span>2/18/2008 7:37:46 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;Paul Poletti&quot; &lt;paul@...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt; Additionally, for those who want to try accompany Brad through his<br/>&gt; looking glass and into the alternative space-time continuo-um of the<br/>&gt; 18th century specialist, a magical world where the Evil Wicked Dr.<br/>&gt; Science with his monstrous Spectrum-o-thons is kept safely at bay,<br/>&gt; I&apos;ve posted another audio file of just (purely speaking) the 45/32 +4<br/>&gt; alone, sustained for a spell, and then followed by the mystical<br/>&gt; appearance of Our Lady of the Phantom Octave:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; <a href="http://www.polettipiano.com/faith_based_acoustics/indoctrinate_me.mp3">www.polettipiano.com/faith_based_acoustics/indoctrinate_me.mp3</a><br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Listen to it over and over again until you begin to hear the octave<br/>&gt; BEFORE it is actually played.

This creates a JI 45/32 between d and g#.</p><p>Actually, what you (and Brad) are doing is defining the limits of the<br/>basic framework of 1/6 comma meantone. Setting the pure major third<br/>simultaneously establishes the Syntonic comma and spreads it over a<br/>range spanning 4 adjacent fifths, even though the individual fifths<br/>are not yet established. Adding two more pure fifths (going clockwise<br/>around the circle) merely expands the territory to 6 fifths, which is<br/>the very defintion of 1/6 comma meantone: the Syntonic comma<br/>distributed over 6 fifths. The only thing left to do is temper the 6<br/>fifths between the extremes by the same amount. The same trick works<br/>with 1/5 comma by adding one fifth on top of the third, or 2/7 by<br/>taking one pure fifth AWAY from TWO stacked pure major thirds (thus,<br/>two Syntonic commas spanning 7 fifths), or 2/9 by adding one more<br/>fifth tow two stacked pure major thirds. In all cases, you are doing<br/>exactly what the name says. No need for that tedious inaccurate<br/>mucking about with &quot;tune a pure major third and then expand it a<br/>little&quot;. Just do it right from the get-go.</p><p>&gt; And whath<br/>&gt; happens? It beats. It is not pure. To me it just sounded like any old<br/>&gt; tempered tritone. I was able to put the tritone into pure tuning by<br/>&gt; ear, by eliminating the beats: the result is 7/5. (Recording to follow<br/>&gt; soon.)</p><p>Of course you&apos;re right, though I would say that it is not entirely<br/>corect to speak of a &quot;pure&quot; tritone, since it is a contradiction in<br/>terms. A &quot;tritone&quot; is by definition three tones, and three pure tones<br/>(9/8 cubed) makes an interval which is anything but &quot;pure&quot;. Better<br/>perhaps to say that 7/5 is a septimal augmented 4th.</p><p>&gt;<br/>&gt; It remains a mystery what Brad&apos;s definition of &apos;pure&apos; could be, such<br/>&gt; that obviously beating intervals can satisfy it.</p><p>Your main problem, Thomas, is that you&apos;re not following the lesson<br/>closely enough. Brad specifically said that it has to be done on an<br/>instrument which has little harmonic development above the 6th<br/>partial. Originally it seemed to be only the case with the spinet in<br/>his office, but now it appears to be a deficiency which afflicts ALL<br/>his instruments.</p><p>In any event, you must find a similarly harmonically-crippled<br/>instrument to perform the experiment. Alternatively, you can adapt a<br/>normal instrument by installing a set of Lehman String Purifiers (Pat.<br/>Pending), also available in many music shops under the brand name<br/>Sept-Away Mini-Mutes. Put one on each string in the position indicated<br/>in the instructions, and that nasty, bothersome beating will<br/>disappear, leaving only the pure, strong, and obvious ringing of the<br/>45/32 tritone.</p><p>&gt;<br/>&gt; It might also be useful to check some historical writers&apos; definitions<br/>&gt; of &apos;pure&apos; intervals. So far as I know there is no acoustically<br/>&gt; meaningful definition that does not require the elimination of beats.<br/>&gt;<br/>Like the very vivid and precise descriptions of Praetorius and<br/>Werckmeister, for example. But then, alas, neither of them were<br/>experts in 18th century continuo realization.</p><p>Ciao,</p><p>P</p></div><h3>Petr Par&#xED;zek &#x3C;p.parizek@chello.cz&#x3E;</h3><span>2/18/2008 7:54:17 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Brad Lehman wrote:</p><p>&gt; Now, what difference tones do you hear playing the same<br/>&gt; D-G# to C#-A resolution, all in regular 1/6 comma?</p><p>Just tried it.

It&apos;s not exactly like any given instrument, but to<br/>&gt;     say that it is &quot;decidedly non-harpsichordistic&quot; is simply not true.</p><p>What if you&apos;d manufacture something that has a diminuendo and a bloom like real harpsichord tone, instead of the flatlined sustained sound (your &quot;indoctrinate_me&quot; file) that changes the experiment?  Even if you&apos;ve sampled or simulated a waveform from a single vibrating harpsichord string (what material? iron? brass? oder?), as soon as you sustain it you&apos;ve altered its character profoundly.</p><p>And play the tritone&apos;s two notes together, or nearly so, instead of staggered by a second or more.  The two notes have to have a similar intensity, similar voicing, and similar bloom/decay pattern for this to sound anything like a harpsichord.</p><p>Better yet, what if you&apos;d make top-quality recordings of real harpsichord sound at various distances from the strings and soundboard, such as 10cm / 50cm / 2m / 10m / 30m in the direction where the player/tuner sits, and similar distances in other directions too?</p><p>Furthermore, listeners to ordinary 18th century harpsichord music have to make their assessment of intervallic quality almost immediately as the notes are played...not after 15-30 seconds of contemplation of a single artificially sustained sound.</p><p>When I&apos;m tuning here, I usually know in the first half second or so if I&apos;ve got the 45/32 tritone spot-on with one syntonic comma of shift between the two notes.  It&apos;s pure.  If it were necessary, which it isn&apos;t, I can temporarily tune a bass note under it giving the simultaneous 16:9 and the 5:2 or 5:4 against both notes.</p><p>And far more time and energy is being wasted here explaining this to (mostly) non-harpsichord-tuners than simply doing it.  It&apos;s just not that hard to do, and it doesn&apos;t need rationalized explanations either. I know that Paul, Tom, and some others here DO tune harpsichords with more than adequate by-ear experience, and I remain startled that either they honestly don&apos;t hear what I do, or that they&apos;re too proud or self-certain or whatever to admit experiencing the (to me, obvious) purity of 45/32 on real harpsichords.

If the interval is getting close to epimoric, the difference tones (which there are more of them audible if the sounding tones are rather high) get close to regular harmonic series, which proves the general synchronicity of the periods quite nicely -- i.e. the common fundamental. If it was a &quot;semi-epimoric&quot; factor (if I can use a term like that) like 9/7 or 7/5, the actual difference tone would be an octave higher than the fundamental and the surrounding difference tones would resemble odd harmonic series.</p><p>&gt; I think combination tones are of very limited use in tuning.<br/>&gt; There may be specialized cases where they are useful, but<br/>&gt; not in general.</p><p>I don&apos;t think so. Again, when I hear JI intervals in higher octaves (meaning just diads without any third tone), I can often (let&apos;s say X for the lower frequency and Y for the higher one) hear Y-X and 2X-Y, sometimes also 3X-2Y, and rarely even 2Y-X. If the sound is richer in overtones, even more difference tones become audible. About four hours ago, I tried to play various JI intervals with a harmonium sample on my keyboard. When I got to 9/7, I was actually able to hear an additional 3:4:5 in the background. When I reached 14/11, I could eventually hear a non-existent 5:6:8 there. What&apos;s my explanation? For 9/7, the actual difference tone is 2 and the surrounding difference tones are 3, 5, and 11. For 14/11, they are 3, 5, 8, 17, respectively. Because the harmonium sample I used has its 2nd harmonic quite loud, the actual difference tones of the upper octaves also played a part, which is 4 in the first case and 6 in the second one.</p><p>&gt; Can you hear 6/5 clearer than 5/3?</p><p>Yes, usually it sounds to me like that.</p><p>&gt; I think it&apos;d be a great exercise if you made files for the<br/>&gt; epimores from 8/7 through 25/24 (if you were so inclined).<br/>&gt; Ideally the sweep would go from the mediant below to the<br/>&gt; mediant above the target ratio in the series of epimores,<br/>&gt; i.e. from 19/17 to 17/15 for 9/8, with the target ratio in<br/>&gt; the middle of the file.</p><p>Sounds like a nice challenge.

Again, when I hear JI intervals in higher<br/>&gt; octaves (meaning just diads without any third tone), I can often<br/>&gt; (let&apos;s say X for the lower frequency and Y for the higher one)<br/>&gt; hear Y-X and 2X-Y, sometimes also 3X-2Y, and rarely even 2Y-X.<br/>&gt; If the sound is richer in overtones, even more difference tones<br/>&gt; become audible. About four hours ago, I tried to play various<br/>&gt; JI intervals with a harmonium sample on my keyboard. When I got<br/>&gt; to 9/7, I was actually able to hear an additional 3:4:5 in the<br/>&gt; background. When I reached 14/11, I could eventually hear a<br/>&gt; non-existent 5:6:8 there. What&apos;s my explanation? For 9/7, the<br/>&gt; actual difference tone is 2 and the surrounding difference tones<br/>&gt; are 3, 5, and 11. For 14/11, they are 3, 5, 8, 17, respectively.<br/>&gt; Because the harmonium sample I used has its 2nd harmonic quite<br/>&gt; loud, the actual difference tones of the upper octaves also<br/>&gt; played a part, which is 4 in the first case and 6 in the second<br/>&gt; one.</p><p>Sure you can hear these things, but do they help you<br/>accurately tune the main interval?</p><p>&gt; &gt; Can you hear 6/5 clearer than 5/3?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Yes, usually it sounds to me like that.</p><p>For me the &apos;locked&apos; region around 6/5 is not as well<br/>defined as around 5/3.</p><p>&gt; &gt; I think it&apos;d be a great exercise if you made files for the<br/>&gt; &gt; epimores from 8/7 through 25/24 (if you were so inclined).<br/>&gt; &gt; Ideally the sweep would go from the mediant below to the<br/>&gt; &gt; mediant above the target ratio in the series of epimores,<br/>&gt; &gt; i.e. from 19/17 to 17/15 for 9/8, with the target ratio in<br/>&gt; &gt; the middle of the file.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Sounds like a nice challenge. Do you have any preferences<br/>&gt; about absolute pitches or about the loudnesses of the overtones?</p><p>I would start each file on different pitch between<br/>middle C and the A below it.

I think also that when musicians take those tests and find that they can&apos;t pass them, they may unnecessarily tell themselves that they can&apos;t hear something when in fact they can - just not in the sense that was tested by the tests. Reason being that there are many ways of hearing, which may not always involve intellectually identifying pitches as e..g higher or lower.</p><p>For instance when notes are very close together in pitch, sometimes one may hear that there is a difference, but not be sure which is the highest in pitch of the two. Not even able to tell which was played first. Just that it seems to be two different pitches rather than a single pitch. I remember that used to happen to me quite a lot a few years ago though not often now. Some people can distinguish notes a tone or a semitone apart but can&apos;t tell which of the two is higher - as is mentioned in Shepard&apos;s original paper.</p><p>That then needs a subtler test than just to get someone to put the pitches in order, or to say which is the higher.</p><p>You could still test it. One idea is to have pairs of pitches. Some of the pairs are identical notes, and some are non identical. Then ask the listener to identify whether the two notes they hear are the same pitch or differ in pitch, without asking them to identify which they think is the highest in pitch.</p><p>But you can get more subtle than that too. You can be influenced by things that you can&apos;t actually distinguish intellectually, because you haven&apos;t yet learnt to identify them in words. But maybe your body responds in subtly different ways, e.g. different piano touch or something. Like using a dowsing rod to detect the presence of water, putting aside whether that actually works or not but same principle. That if you set up a delicate balance in your body then it may be influenced by things you can&apos;t actually intellectually hear. So one may perhaps play in a subtly different way in a tuning that you can&apos;t actually distinguish by ear in an intellectual fashion.</p><p>That could be quite hard to test, but real nevertheless. You probably could still test it if you did a delicate enough kind of experiment to pick up on the thing you are testing for. I.e.. the test has to match the effect you are looking for and it&apos;s not always that obvious what is a suitable test, it seems, in this area.</p><p>Just a few ideas to throw out :-)..</p><p>Robert</p></div><h3>Paul Poletti &#x3C;paul@polettipiano.com&#x3E;</h3><span>2/19/2008 11:21:57 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, Petr Par&iacute;zek &lt;p.parizek@...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Brad Lehman wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; Better yet, what if you&apos;d make top-quality recordings of real<br/>&gt; &gt; harpsichord sound at various distances from the strings and<br/>soundboard,<br/>&gt; &gt; such as 10cm / 50cm / 2m / 10m / 30m in the direction where the<br/>&gt; &gt; player/tuner sits, and similar distances in other directions too?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; If there&apos;s something which most people don&apos;t find pure, they<br/>&gt;probably won&apos;t find it pure even on a real harpsichord.</p><p>Amen to that!</p><p>&gt;I&apos;ve tried lots of samples yesterday, no matter if those were<br/>&gt;decaying or sustained sounds, no matter if their timbres had a<br/>&gt;&quot;bloom&quot; or not,</p><p>Couldn&apos;t have said it better myself.</p><p>&gt; no matter if their overtones were loud or soft, whatever I tried to<br/>&gt;play D-G# C#-A in 1/6-comma meantone, I always heard two &quot;fictitious&quot;<br/>&gt;slightly mistuned bass fifths of Bb-F and A-E, which can be explained<br/>&gt;by the difference tones. Having this very clear and easily<br/>&gt;understandable experience with sound samples which were so much<br/>&gt;different from each other, I would probably not begin hearing<br/>&gt;something completely new on the harpsichord you talk about.</p><p>Exactly! I&apos;ve been tuning harpsichords and historic pianos for about<br/>35 years now. I can&apos;t begin to estimate how many different instruments<br/>I&apos;ve tuned in this time, good, bad, and downright butt ugly. I started<br/>tuning by ear, but in the early 1980&apos;s, after many attempts to build a<br/>good visual indicator (a combination of strobe and oscilliscope), I<br/>realized that it was stupid to use your eyes for something your ears<br/>are far better at. So I designed and produced the &quot;Poletti Box&quot;, a<br/>tone generator programmed with about 40 temperaments which could be<br/>shifted in pitch from A=1 Hz to about 490 Hz in 0,1 Hz steps. Ever<br/>since then, I&apos;ve tuned by setting the twelve unisons of the tenor<br/>octave to the 12 tones provided by some sort of electronic device.</p><p>Now this doesn&apos;t mean that I don&apos;t check the quality of intervals<br/>after finishing, and one of the things that is really interesting<br/>about the whole process is how real instruments can differ slightly<br/>from electronic precision. One of my main points has always been<br/>accuracy, never accepting anything less than at least 0,01 Hz (not<br/>cents) in terms of frequency production, which keeps any beating error<br/>to a tolerable minimum. It&apos;s quite interesting how on some<br/>instruments, even though the unisons can sound absolutely perfect<br/>against the electronic sound, certain intervals such as fifths or<br/>thirds don&apos;t beat correctly and require some minor tweaking. It all<br/>comes down to localized funkiness, of course, inharmonicity caused by<br/>a false string, localized aberrations in soundboard impedance, and the<br/>like.</p><p>All that said, my overwhelming conclusion is that it is only more<br/>difficult to hear anything on a real instrument than on an electronic<br/>instrument, provided of course that the electronic is both precise and<br/>reasonable rich in overtone content. It is not for nothing that<br/>Werckmeister said the student of tuning who has trouble with a<br/>harpsichord should practice using a regal. Why? Precisely because the<br/>tone is (a) sustained and (b) rich in harmonics. Brad&apos;s implied<br/>assertion that somehow his phantom tones are suddenly going to appear<br/>if we impose all the handicaps and DISadvantages of the sound of a<br/>real harpsichord is just plain nonsense. And remember, his whole point<br/>initially was that this effect was so overwhelming and powerful that<br/>it might have compelled several generations of composers to use<br/>certain chord structures. Now he would have use believe that it only<br/>exists under carefully controlled conditions, with only a certain type<br/>of string materials, at certain precise distance to &quot;the strings&quot;<br/>(which any Acoustics 1a student can tell you are NOT the point of<br/>sound radiation source in ANY string instrument), with only certain<br/>envelopes (the proper term for Brad&apos;s &quot;diminuendo&quot; and &quot;bloom&quot;), etc.<br/>etc. etc.</p><p>Brad simply doesn&apos;t want to accept that his perception is subjective,<br/>so he keeps changing his story and tossing out one pointless argument<br/>after another. I would posit that since it is HIS assertion that he<br/>hears it on HIS harpsichords tuned by HIM, the responsibility of<br/>providing any proof rests upon him. So he should stop dreaming up<br/>excuses, get himself down to Radio Shack and shell out 15 bucks or so<br/>for a decent microphone and then make a recording at whatever distance<br/>he wants, though I would posit that since HE hears it when he is<br/>tuning, the most logical point to place the mic would be next to his<br/>head as he is seated at the instrument (how many people listen to the<br/>instrument at a distance of 5cm from the strings?). That should end<br/>the matter once and for all.

It seems as though Brad is saying that his mental processing of<br/>musical tones seeks relationships which can be explained with extended<br/>JI relationships, a sort of virtual reduction of an extended JI<br/>fractalization. Ok, let&apos;s go with that idea and see where it takes us.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; When I hear a 45/32 tritone, an augmented fourth, I recognize that<br/>&gt; instantly as &quot;pure&quot; because both members belong to an easy JI scale in<br/>&gt; relationship with one another...and my ear automatically fills in more<br/>&gt; members of the same scale, the most obvious first new note being (as I<br/>&gt; said) a 9/8 second above or a 16/9 minor seventh below.

So the salient points are:</p><p>(1) any two notes which &quot;both ... belong to an easy JI scale in<br/>relationship with one another&quot; are perceived by Brad as being pure,<br/>precisely because they fit into some sort of extended JI scheme. We&apos;re<br/>not quite sure what the word &quot;easy&quot; means, but we might assume it<br/>means &quot;simple&quot;, as in fairly simple ratios, or perhaps JI<br/>relationships which don&apos;t require too many leap-frog jumps on Brad&apos;s<br/>internal sonic checkerboard; shall we say, a minimum of JI<br/>fractalization?</p><p>(2) that other tones which are not physically sounding appear in<br/>Brad&apos;s perceptual tonescape because they fit into some solution to the<br/>internal search process which fits a relatively simple set of JI<br/>ratios, again requiring a minimum of fractalization, in order to fill<br/>in the gaps and produce a larger, more complex harmonic structure<br/>which is nonetheless composed of simple ratios.</p><p>I think it is fair to say that&apos;s an accurate analysis of his logic,<br/>but someone correct me please if I am missing something or overstating<br/>something else.</p><p>Now, the logic in application:</p><p>&gt;  Play<br/>&gt; me a 45/32 tritone and I instantly recognize the shape &quot;pure dominant<br/>&gt; 7th: root-M3-m7 in JI&quot;...even when the root isn&apos;t being played.</p><p>Right. Understood, at lest I think so. Now the obvious elephant in<br/>Brad&apos;s intellectual workshop, which outh to be pretty easy for anybody<br/>on this list to see, might be phrased thusly; &quot;So Brad, what happens<br/>when you hear a tritone in 1/3 comma meantone?&quot;</p><p>Why? Because the tritone in 1/3 mean has the ratio of 25/18, which is<br/>not only an even simpler version of a &quot;pure&quot; augmented fourth, using<br/>the standard terminology of pure (i.e. an incidence of harmonic<br/>congruence which is lower in the series of both tones rather than<br/>higher), but it also would seem by Brad&apos;s logic to create an even more<br/>compelling series of &quot;easy&quot; JI relationships. Assuming the upper note<br/>makes a pure major third above some note, we would get the following<br/>series of 4 notes from top down:</p><p>25<br/>20<br/>18<br/>10</p><p>25/20 = 5/4<br/>20/18 = 10/9 or the minor whole tone, a simple and readily<br/>recognizable interval<br/>18/10 = 9/5 which is the second most simple &quot;natural 7th&quot;, being<br/>almost as &quot;pure&quot; (again by normal definition) as THE natural 7th, 7/4,<br/>and certainly far more simple than Brad&apos;s &quot;easy&quot; 16/9 minor 7th.</p><p>So, if we tally it all up, we have:</p><p>(a) two intervals which are markedly simpler than Brad&apos;s 1/6 comma<br/>version, the augmented 4th and the minor 7th</p><p>(b) one interval which is ever so slightly more complex (the minor<br/>whole tone as opposed to the major)</p><p>(c) two intervals which are identical (pure octave, pure third)</p><p>So by Brad&apos;s logic, the augmented 4th in 1/3 comma meantone should be<br/>even purer yet, since it fits into what would appear to be an even<br/>&quot;easier JI scale&quot;. At the very least, I would think it would be<br/>equally &quot;Brad-pure&quot; (maybe we should call it Brure?... after we figure<br/>out exactly what IT is, that is!).</p><p>Hmmmm....</p><p>&gt;<br/>&gt; Maybe some<br/>&gt; would classify this and dismiss this as merely a subjective thing, and<br/>&gt; therefore not real TO THEM, but it&apos;s obviously an objective and<br/>&gt; measurable reality that I&apos;m hearing: the offset of exactly one syntonic<br/>&gt; comma defining geometric marker points, and laying out other<br/>elements of<br/>&gt; simple scales.</p><p>This is where Brad gets into trouble, and having had lots of these<br/>disagreements with Brad over the years, it seems to be a recurring<br/>breakdown point in his arguments: he looses track of what is truly<br/>objective and measurable and what is a subjective conclusion drawn<br/>from a series of objective conditions. It&apos;s rather like me saying that<br/>if I stand on the street in front the entrance to my building, I can<br/>see the supermarket 30 meters around the corner, because I can see the<br/>bank and restaurant and the flower shop on the other three corners,<br/>and after years of going there I know that the supermarket is just 30<br/>meters to the left of that triangle of reference points. All true<br/>enough, and the relationships between those observable objects and the<br/>supermarket are all objective and verifiable by anyone; yet the fact<br/>remains that just because I can see three points from which one can<br/>indeed see the supermarket, I cannot actually SEE the supermarket from<br/>where I am now, no matter how vivid it is in my imagination, nor can<br/>anyone else, and therefore, &quot;seeing&quot; the supermarket is not an<br/>objective reality.</p><p>&gt; When I hear a tritone within regular 1/6, it&apos;s huge; and<br/>&gt; when I hear two of them interlocked as a diminished-7th, it&apos;s even more<br/>&gt; huge.  It&apos;s pure.</p><p>Umm, now it seems as though width is also a factor of Brure. OK, we&apos;ll<br/>just have to accept that and throw it into the mix. A work in progress...</p><p>&gt; It makes the harpsichord more powerful when it&apos;s a<br/>&gt; 45/32 than when it is off-spot.  It&apos;s so startling when it comes up<br/>that<br/>&gt; I can&apos;t NOT hear it, even though I spend most of my time playing in<br/>&gt; other temperaments where things ARE deliberately off-spot by a little<br/>&gt; bit.</p><p>Right. So I think the only logical interpretation of this statement is<br/>that Brad likes the particular sound of this interval, and so when he<br/>hears it, it stands out to him. That it actually increase the acoustic<br/>output of the harpsichord is highly unlikely, but that could easily be<br/>verified objectively. Let&apos;s leave it in the bin labeled &quot;unverifiable<br/>assertion&quot; for the moment, which bin is definitely on the subjective<br/>side of our intellectual workbench.</p><p>&gt;   Simplicity and complexity both have their virtues, and they do<br/>&gt; different things to or in the brain.)</p><p>Couldn&apos;t agree more. It&apos;s just not clear exactly how they are<br/>operative in the set of conditions you have laid out for us, and/or<br/>how one situation compares to similar conditions of simplicity and<br/>complexity.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I&apos;m sorry that my descriptions of this don&apos;t convince people who<br/>weren&apos;t<br/>&gt; already hearing it.</p><p>Well, unless I missed a post, the only person who was &quot;already&quot;<br/>hearing it, and the only person who still is &quot;already&quot; hearing it, is<br/>you. So it&apos;s kind of a funny sentence, which would seem to imply that<br/>there are more people in Brad&apos;s camp than just Brad himself.</p><p>Once again, I think the only way to understand this is that Brad has a<br/>series of subjective expectations which so strongly influence his<br/>perception that he has difficulty separating that which is actually<br/>occurring from that which he imagines. Not intended as a putdown, and<br/>I will say that the capability of compelling imagination is very<br/>important for good musicianship, or at least for allowing someone to<br/>make interesting music. One should be aware of it, though, and not<br/>assume that others are automatically on your wavelength, and also not<br/>imply that their problem is that they aren&apos;t &quot;experts&quot; in the<br/>interpretation of 18th continuo, which would mean a simple lack of<br/>knowledge. This doesn&apos;t seem to be the case.

Because the tritone in 1/3 mean has the ratio of 25/18, which<br/>&gt; is<br/>&gt; not only an even simpler version of a &quot;pure&quot; augmented fourth, using<br/>&gt; the standard terminology of pure (i.e. an incidence of harmonic<br/>&gt; congruence which is lower in the series of both tones rather than<br/>&gt; higher), but it also would seem by Brad&apos;s logic to create an even<br/>&gt; more compelling series of &quot;easy&quot; JI relationships.</p><p>Of course I hear 25/18 (and its inversion, 36/25) as pure, in 1/3<br/>comma mean.

Frankly i tried to contact you off list to deal with a rather minor misunderstanding, but you refused to discuss it.<br/>but i will try once more.<br/>I don&apos;t remember brad saying it was beatless, he said it had a pure quality to his ear. Pure is subjective to the culture, for example, as i showed an example.<br/>By functional i am referring the to a dominant chord. As we know a 7/5 does not work in dominant chord so i assume Brad is applying the term in reference to that.<br/>It seemed by his response that he confirmed that at least in part.<br/>The whole argument, as far as i can see, is one and only one of terminology.<br/>As you might know i am an promoter of JI over other systems so i will use 7s when ever the opportunity allows me too. I am not going to use Brad&apos;s tuning i do not think. But like those that use ETs i will accept what people tell me what they hear to some extent. Scriabin saw colors, and yet i can take a 100 people and none of them will see what he saw. I don&apos;t see what this proves except the rarity of his perception. and likewise that i would not assume some defect of those who don&apos;t since those words were being put into my mouth.</p><p>Tom Dent wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I think if you set up 1/4-comma meantone on a harpsichord and ask a<br/>&gt; hundred harpsichordists whether middle c-e is pure or whether c-g is<br/>&gt; beating, you will get the answer &apos;Yes&apos; 100 times. That is perception<br/>&gt; but it is not subjective...<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; If we can read 300-year old books and still understand, to some<br/>&gt; extent, what they said about tuning, there must be some objective<br/>&gt; elements in acoustic perception. It is precisely these elements - &apos;if<br/>&gt; you do this, you will hear that&apos; - that let us get anywhere at all<br/>&gt; with history. (This has led to an overvaluing of mathematically<br/>&gt; precise source material, but that&apos;s another story.)<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I don&apos;t object at all to Brad&apos;s hearing &apos;geometrically&apos;. But I would<br/>&gt; object if he or anyone else were to say or imply he has a special or<br/>&gt; better or deeper insight into historic tunings because of it.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; And what is Kraig doing saying (previous message) that I &apos;can&apos;t&apos; hear<br/>&gt; whatever it is? What I can&apos;t do is things like play the<br/>&gt; &apos;Hammerklavier&apos; sonata or run a 4-minute mile. So is my hearing not<br/>&gt; good or practised or geometric enough for the magic tritone? ... &apos;Can&apos;<br/>&gt; and &apos;can&apos;t&apos; are pretty judgemental. I simply *don&apos;t* hear it.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Anyway, &apos;functional purity&apos; is still mysterious to me. Does the 45/32<br/>&gt; tritone have a special, irreplaceable musical function within a scale<br/>&gt; that other tritones that are also somewhat sharper than 7/5 definitely<br/>&gt; don&apos;t? Seems to me that many intervals in the Western chromatic scale<br/>&gt; can fulfil their functions pretty well within a largish range of<br/>&gt; intonation - maybe up to a comma.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; How far can Brad adjust the interval such that the magic feeling is<br/>&gt; still there? What is the wiggle-room? How precise is his aural<br/>&gt; geometry? This would be a good time for some self-testing, tuning<br/>&gt; hammer in hand...<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; ~~~T~~~<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; --- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a> &lt;mailto:tuning%<a href="http://40yahoogroups.com">40yahoogroups.com</a>&gt;, Kraig &gt; Grady &lt;kraiggrady@...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; No reason to qualify your perception as subjective.

Millions of musicians every day<br/>&gt; quite accurately produce ET major and minor thirds, which are<br/>&gt; completely arbitrary intervals, and they sound quite foreign (and<br/>&gt; ugly) to me.
