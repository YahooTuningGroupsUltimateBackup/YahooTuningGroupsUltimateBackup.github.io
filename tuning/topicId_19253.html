The adjective was<br/>very carefully chosen after doing a survey of all historical organ builders who<br/>have web sites. I think I turned up some 50 new or restored organs in MT, not<br/>including small continuo organs and the like.</p><p>(2) I have qualified the reference to the distribution of 1/6 comma meantone to<br/>specify a late era and specifically the association with the maker Silbermann<br/>(whose organs were so roundly praised by Mozart).  The H&iuml;&iquest;&half;ndel reference has been<br/>made more modest (I&apos;ve not got any reference materials here in Budapest).</p><p>(3) To Hermann Miller: I&apos;m aware of many other variants, but I&apos;d hesitate to<br/>include them in this FAQ item. In fact, I think I pushed the envelope enough<br/>already by including the historical nth-comma variants, which are debatably not<br/>MT, as they no longer have wholetones at the mean of a just major third. If i<br/>were writing DJW&apos;s tuning dictionary, instead of a FAQ, I would have done it<br/>differently, i.e. given more weight to fifth-comma temperament, which I used in<br/>my opera, THE WHITE CANOE (shameless plug).</p><p>(4) Setting a meantone: do you start with a just third or with the fifths? I<br/>learned with the third first and can&apos;t imagine not having that reference point<br/>to work with.  But the order is immaterial for the purposes of a FAQ.</p><p>(5) Preference for g minor, this has been qualified to refer to Viennese<br/>classicism. My reference is Kelletat.</p><p>So, here&apos;s the second draft:</p><p>WHAT IS MEANTONE (MT)?</p><p>(Second draft of a FAQ entry)</p><p>Meantone (MT) is a temperament where the syntonic comma (81:80; 21.5 cents) is<br/>distributed equally among a fixed number of successive fifths.  The standard, or<br/>_quarter-comma MT_, distributes the comma among four fifths, so that their<br/>octave-reduced sum is a just major third (5:4, 386.3 cents).  The pefect fifth<br/>in quarter-comma MT has a size of 696.6 cents. This can be tuned by ear by<br/>initially setting a just major third (i.e. c&apos;-e&apos;) and then, tempering the<br/>intermediate fifths identically (octave reduced: c&apos;-g&apos;-d&apos;-a&apos;-e&apos;). The name MT is<br/>derived from the size of the wholetone (193.15 cents), which divides the just<br/>major third equally and falls between between the just major (9:8) and minor<br/>(10:9) wholetones.</p><p>The major historical variants of MT include:</p><p>Third-comma MT, where an octave-reduced just major sixth (5:3, 884.4 cents) is<br/>the sum of three fifths of 693.3 cents),</p><p>Fifth-comma, where an octave-reduced just major seventh (15:8, 1088.3 cents) is<br/>the sum of five fifths of 697.6 cents),</p><p>Sixth-comma, where an octave-reduced just augmented fourth (45:32, 590.2 cents)<br/>is the sum of six fifths of 698.4 cents). After quarter-comma MT, sixth-tone<br/>temperament was perhaps most widely used, especially in the organs of the late<br/>baroque<br/>and classical eras built by Silbermann.</p><p>The process of distributing the comma can continue indefinitely or in fractional<br/>variations, i.e. Zarlino&apos;s 2/7-comma MT. When the comma is distributed over<br/>eleven fifths, the result is very close to 12tet (12tet actually is a<br/>redistribution of the _pythagorean_ comma over 12 fifths, see 12TET).<br/>Quarter-comma MT is closely approximated by 31tet, third-comma MT by 19tet,<br/>fifth-comma MT by 43tet, sixth comma by 55tet.</p><p>In quarter-comma meantone, with a keyboard of 12 keys per octave, eight major<br/>triads will have just major thirds, typically the triads on Eb through E. It is<br/>essential to note that although these tunings were chiefly used on keyboard<br/>instruments with finite numbers of keys per octave, MTs are not tunings with<br/>fixed numbers of pitches. The series of MT-fifths can be continued indefinitely,<br/>with each additional tone adding an additional available tonality. MT<br/>instruments with more than 12 keys per octave were not unknown, and G.F.H&iuml;&iquest;&half;ndel<br/>played on instruments with up to 16 keys per octave.</p><p>Music in MT is notated with the standard pythagorean scheme: seven nominals or<br/>staff positions without accidentals are modified by sharps (#) as one ascends by<br/>fifths and flats (b) as one descends. This process continues indefinitely. Due<br/>to the smaller size of fifth the chromatic semitone will be smaller than the<br/>diatonic. Thus in MT c# is lower in pitch than db; the opposite relationship is<br/>heard in pythagorean tuning.</p><p>MT was the standard keyboard tuning in the 16th, 17th, and 18th centuries. The<br/>earliest recorded description of a MT tuning procedure is usually attributed to<br/>Pietro Aron in his _Toscanella_ (Venice, 1523). Common usage of MT or MT<br/>variants continued well into the 19th century with its final replacement by<br/>various well temperaments and 12tet occuring definitively only around 1850. MT<br/>has been widely revived for performances of early music; modern tracker organs<br/>in MT are not uncommon. Contemporary composers Gy&iuml;&iquest;&half;rgy Ligeti and Douglas Leedy<br/>have composed works in quarter-comma MT.</p><p>Given the pre-eminence of MT in the era when common practice tonality developed,<br/>it is useful to consider which qualities of MT were assumed by composers and<br/>positively reflected in musical repertoire.  These qualities included the purity<br/>of the major third and a good major triad; a preference for major over minor<br/>tonality (for Viennese classical music, when minor, a preference for g); a<br/>limited range of usable tonalities (typically Eb to A); a leading tone<br/>significantly lower than that of<br/>pythagorean or 12tet; a dissonant minor seventh, requiring resolution; an<br/>augmented sixth intonationally distinct from the minor seventh (indeed, the MT<br/>augmented sixth is a good approximation of a 7:4). More fundamental, however, is<br/>the assumption in harmonic practice that motion by mediant intervals, thirds and<br/>sixths, can also be heard as the sum of successive perfect fifths and fourths.<br/>For example, in MT, the harmonic progression from a C major triad to an a minor<br/>triad is extremely smooth due to the pure third c-e. It can then be complemented<br/>by a satisfactory return motion by fifths, from a to d to G to C. Inasmuch as<br/>common practice tonality can be characterized by such distinctive interaction<br/>between triads with roots related by fifths and fourths and triads with roots<br/>related by thirds or sixths, it was the compromist of MT that provided the<br/>intonational environment in which this interaction was first realized on<br/>instruments of fixed pitch.</p><p>DJW</p></div><h3><a id=19254 href="#19254">ðŸ”—</a>Paul H.
