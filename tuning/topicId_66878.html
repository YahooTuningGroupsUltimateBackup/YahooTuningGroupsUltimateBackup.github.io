The article on the TV show 24, for example, only has a few<br/>words different from the Wikipedia version.</p><p>&gt; Is it a copyright violation to say it?</p><p>Saying &quot;all rights reserved&quot; is most definitely a violation of the<br/>GFDL copyright license. The GFDL basically says &quot;we don&apos;t reserve all<br/>rights, in fact we give most of them to you, but only on the condition<br/>that you don&apos;t reserve any of them either&quot;.</p><p>Anyway, this is totally off topic...</p><p>Keenan</p></div>
