This field is recognised in<br/>Indian music (see  <a href="http://www.kcbbs.gen.nz/users/rtomes/in_music.gif">http://www.kcbbs.gen.nz/users/rtomes/in_music.gif</a>).</p><p>In this table each horizontal displacement to the right represents a<br/>3/2 ratio.  Each displacement to the upper right equals a 5/4 ratio.<br/>Therefore to the lower right is 6/5.  The notation is designed to be<br/>totally unambiguous and the table goes far enough that we shouldn&apos;t<br/>normally fall off the edges if we start around the natural notes.</p><p>    A-   E-   B-   F#-  C#-  G#-  D#-  A#   E#   B#<br/>  F-   C-   G-   D-   A    E    B    F#   C#   G#   D#<br/>     Ab   Eb   Bb   F    C    G    D    A+   E+   B+<br/>   Fb   Cb   Gb   Db   Ab+  Eb+  Bb+  F+   C+   G+   D+</p><p>Any shape like this grouping ...<br/>    A    E    B<br/>  F    C    G    D<br/>... can be picked out anywhere and will have the standard JI tuning<br/>ratios for a major scale of ...</p><p>Note   C    D    E    F    G    A    B<br/>Ratio  1   9/8  5/4  4/3  3/2  5/3  15/8</p><p>The additional notations have the following meanings</p><p>Notation     #         b      +      -      ^      v<br/>Meaning   135/128  128/135  81/80  80/81  64/63  63/64</p><p>Notation     #-     b+     bv     #^<br/>Meaning    25/24  24/25  14/15  15/14   etc.</p><p>So for example G#- is (3/2)*(135/128)*(80/81) = 25/16<br/>and Bbv is (15/8)*(128/135)*63/64 = 7/4</p><p>A separate table with the v notes can be made which is like the above<br/>but displaced by a factor of 7/4 from it.  Actually the table is 4<br/>dimensional because it has the 4 axes for the primes 2, 3, 5 and 7.<br/>I am going to ignore 11 and 13 although clearly additional dimensions<br/>can be included for these.</p><p>In our tables or diagrams C represents all the &quot;C&quot;s, C1, C2, C3 etc. and<br/>although we call this an identity it isn&apos;t really.  The reason is that<br/>after going up about 4 octaves in the key of C, the tonic will actually<br/>want to shift to G, or if movig down 4 octaves to F.  This may be an<br/>idea of mine and not generally accepted, but we may note that monster<br/>5th chords like F-C-G-D are much more acceptable than the equivalent<br/>4ths, D-G-C-F because the former is like building a split level house<br/>with the lie of the land and the latter is like trying to do it the<br/>other way.  I would be interested in other people&apos;s comments on this<br/>because it is not something that I have ever seen anyone else mention.<br/>A separate post about this &quot;Key drift up the scale&quot; will be made.</p><p>The key point about this great big playing field is that at any one time<br/>we can only light up a small part of it with our spotlight.  If we try<br/>to play A- Db and E+ together then that is musically nonsense.  The zone<br/>that we nomally light up (although this is subject to some slight<br/>variation) is about 7 ratios of 2, 3 ratios of 3 and 1 ratio of 5.</p><p>The centre of the spotlight does not have to be on a note.  It can be<br/>somewhere between notes.  For example the centre of the key of C major<br/>is normally between C, E and G but a little nearer to C perhaps.  If we<br/>make a minor key then it moves into an inverted triangle rather than an<br/>upright triangle.  However the spotlight can gradually move around by<br/>fractions of the cell spacing during a piece.  If it moves by a whole<br/>space horizontally then we modulate by adding or subtracting a sharp or<br/>flat.  But sometimes it will just flirt with doing this which means that<br/>it moves maybe 1/2 or 3/4 of a cell horizontally.  Of course the<br/>individual notes and chords may jump around a within the spotlight and<br/>the spotlight just moves slowly so as to keep the average position of<br/>the dancing in the centre.</p><p>It is clear from the above table that when we play the chord denoted as<br/>D F A that we are actually playing D- F A and when we play G B D we are<br/>playing the real D.  This is another way of saying that compared to C<br/>being 1, in D F A the D is 10/9 while in G B D it is 9/8.  In this case<br/>it is quite clear that confusion is created by calling two different<br/>notes by the same name.  Even if we are in the key of C which contains<br/>the note A, it is quite possible that we may play a lot of notes around<br/>G B D and then an A might really be an A+ because it is much nearer to D<br/>than A is.  It would be obvious if an F# was played that the A was A+<br/>because we would know that we had modulated into the key of G.</p><p>We may see also that chord sequences such as I-vi-ii-V-I are actually<br/>designed to be movements from C E G to C- E- G-.  This is only seen as a<br/>problem because we don&apos;t have a name for C- that is distinct from C.<br/>When someone writes a piece that deliberately modulates from C to C#<br/>then we don&apos;t care that the frequency of C# is different to C.<br/>Therefore if someone does succeed in taking us from C to C- then that is<br/>clearly what they did do although in my opinion it needs a slightly<br/>stronger sequence than the above to do this (that is a bit more<br/>dilly-dallying along the way).</p><p>I will repeat again that the shape of the spotlight is not circular but<br/>that the following number of steps are about equal in each of the axes.</p><p>Prime             2     3     5     7     11    13    17    19  ...<br/>Spread of Index  5.8   2.4   1.0   0.6   0.3   0.25  0.17  0.15 ...</p><p>Quite clearly then we cannot reasonably have 3 different powers of the<br/>higher primes (7 up) in a single scale or it will have too much tension.<br/>Even to have two different powers of the higher primes (11 up) in a<br/>scale requires that the spotlight be accurately placed halfway between<br/>two different planes so that both are equally valid.  In the case of 7<br/>then we can choose places where either two ratios of 7 are quite natural<br/>or where they only one is (i.e no 7 ratios present).</p><p>If we think in terms of this big field, which is just an extension of<br/>all the diagrams people post, then we have a clearer idea of what<br/>happens during a piece of music, or how the composer has decided to just<br/>explore a certain part of the big field.</p><p>Tradition has it that there is a different quality to major and minor<br/>which is the location in the 5 axis.  The Blues have a different quality<br/>due to choosing a location between layers in the 7 axis.  It is possible<br/>to explore locations between the 11 and 13 axes as well or even the 17<br/>and 19 axes.  Even the 3 axis can lead to different qualities of scale<br/>and we can find a region of notes that is half way between C and G if we<br/>want.  This is a lot less radical however because most music floats the<br/>spotlight around in this axis relatively a lot more because of the wider<br/>compass of the spotlight in this direction.</p><p>-- Ray Tomes -- <a href="http://www.kcbbs.gen.nz/users/rtomes/rt-home.htm">http://www.kcbbs.gen.nz/users/rtomes/rt-home.htm</a> --<br/>   Cycles email list -- <a href="http://www.kcbbs.gen.nz/users/af/cyc.htm">http://www.kcbbs.gen.nz/users/af/cyc.htm</a><br/>Alexandria eGroup list -- <a href="http://www.kcbbs.gen.nz/users/af/alex.htm">http://www.kcbbs.gen.nz/users/af/alex.htm</a><br/>Boundaries of Science <a href="http://www.kcbbs.gen.nz/users/af/scienceb.htm">http://www.kcbbs.gen.nz/users/af/scienceb.htm</a></p></div><h3><a id=3015 href="#3015">ðŸ”—</a>rtomes@xxxxx.xxx.xxxxxxxxxxxxx)</h3><span>5/13/1999 7:06:52 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>I just realised that if I spaced things differently like this ...</p><p>   A-  E-  B-  F#- C#- G#- D#- A#  E#  B#</p><p>  F-  C-  G-  D-  A   E   B   F#  C#  G#  D#</p><p>     Ab  Eb  Bb  F   C   G   D   A+  E+  B+</p><p>    Fb  Cb  Gb  Db  Ab+ Eb+ Bb+ F+  C+  G+  D+</p><p>... then it is possible to use a circular spotlight and we get the<br/>correct relative distance between notes in terms of their musical<br/>harmonic relationship to each other.  We can also put little marks where<br/>the centre of chords are and show the flow and consider the<br/>possibilities ...</p><p>   A-  E-  B-  F#- C#- G#- D#- A#  E#  B#</p><p>        6   5</p><p>  F-  C-  G-  D-  A   E   B   F#  C#  G#  D#</p><p>            9   4   2<br/>               8   3   1   7</p><p>     Ab  Eb  Bb  F   C   G   D   A+  E+  B+</p><p>So for example the sequence I-vi-IV-ii-V-I would follow the numbers<br/>starting from 1 in the above as the location of the dance.  The dilemma<br/>is whether to go 1 2 3 4 5 6 and so end up on a different tonic or to go<br/>1 2 3 4 7 1 and end up at the start.  The latter is my preference in<br/>this particular case because although the leap from 4 to 7 is possibly<br/>greater (but certainly not by much) than from 4 to 5 the spotlight is<br/>still centred somewhere between 1 2 3 and 4 and so 7 is still in the<br/>spotlight and 5 is not.</p><p>That is why I say that if a bit more dilly-dallying were done the answer<br/>would be different.  Playing the sequence I-vi-IV-ii-VIIb-v-V-I would<br/>achieve the path 1 2 3 4 8 9 5 6 for example.  In this case the composer<br/>has made it fairly clear that he wants to end on up in C- not in C and<br/>so who am I to disagree.</p><p>Sure, ET gets back to the tonic by making lots of small errors to hide<br/>the shift.  However we can actually hide it in JI also by using a<br/>gradual drag back to the tonic in such cases and have even smaller<br/>errors in JI than in ET but I personally don&apos;t think that we should<br/>because I think that the shift has actually occurred.  If a piece of<br/>music repeated such a shift and gradually drifted then I am of the<br/>opinion that it is either bad music or intention.</p><p>If music is performed from traditional scores then I would expect<br/>results as indicated above.  If someone wants something different then<br/>they should annotate for it.  In marginal cases make it clear what the<br/>intention is.  No problem!?</p><p>-- Ray Tomes -- <a href="http://www.kcbbs.gen.nz/users/rtomes/rt-home.htm">http://www.kcbbs.gen.nz/users/rtomes/rt-home.htm</a> --<br/>   Cycles email list -- <a href="http://www.kcbbs.gen.nz/users/af/cyc.htm">http://www.kcbbs.gen.nz/users/af/cyc.htm</a><br/>Alexandria eGroup list -- <a href="http://www.kcbbs.gen.nz/users/af/alex.htm">http://www.kcbbs.gen.nz/users/af/alex.htm</a><br/>Boundaries of Science <a href="http://www.kcbbs.gen.nz/users/af/scienceb.htm">http://www.kcbbs.gen.nz/users/af/scienceb.htm</a></p></div>
