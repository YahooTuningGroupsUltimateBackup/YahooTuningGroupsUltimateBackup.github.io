You can use<br/>the pitch bend wheel to change the duration of the note - move it up then back to zero pos<br/>to increment note length. (Toggles dotted / double dotted / dotted off if you use it<br/>while playing the note)</p><p>Or you can use modulation wheel and data entry slider to change note length in<br/>same way, but this time depending on pos.</p><p>It is sort of like editing from the MIDI keyboard.</p><p>Then when you play back, it respects most of the dynamics, tempo changes, etc and<br/>all the repeat markings etc.</p><p>You can also apply pitch bends to notes, and do glissandi, which it respects on playback.</p><p>I&apos;ve tried a couple of others, and this one is so much easier to use.

The vertical position of the<br/>text is according to ledger lines, like the notes. For words of a song, so that you want<br/>the notes spaced out to fit above the text, you use: highlight the gray dot, rt click on highlight,<br/>go to Expression placement tab, and select at next note / bar from the Alignment / placement<br/>drop list.</p><p>You can move blocks of notes up and down by highlighting, and then using shift + up /down<br/>arrow keys (and use same method to shift text up / down)</p><p>You can change the spacing between the clefs using:<br/>rt. click on clef | Staff properties | Visual | Vertical size.</p><p>Their web site is:<br/><a href="http://www.ntworthy.com/">http://www.ntworthy.com/</a></p><p>Have a look at some of the scores on Fred Nachbaur&apos;s site to see what<br/>can be done in NWC.<br/><a href="http://www.netidea.com/~fredn/muslist.htm">http://www.netidea.com/~fredn/muslist.htm</a></p><p>Robert</p></div><h3><a id=14978 href="#14978">ðŸ”—</a>M.

As I say in the<br/>first article, soon to be posted, I hope, some actual music may speak<br/>much clearly than theoretical concepts alone.</p><p>By the way, having the principal melody in the lowest part, or mostly<br/>lowest part with some voice crossings, is typical of medieval European<br/>forms like the conductus around 1200, which this piece maybe most<br/>closely resembles. This part is called the tenor in the original sense<br/>of &quot;holding&quot; the melody which serves as the basis for the composition.</p><p>Anyway, it&apos;s wonderful to see a birthday celebration become a musical<br/>event on the Tuning List.</p><p>Most appreciatively,</p><p>Margo Schulter<br/><a href="mailto:mschulter@value.net">mschulter@value.net</a></p></div><h3><a id=15058 href="#15058">ðŸ”—</a>Robert Walker &#x3C;robert_walker@rcwalker.freeserve.co.uk&#x3E;</h3><span>10/25/2000 1:00:55 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Hi Margo</p><p>&gt;Hello, there, everyone, and thanks to Robert Walker for realizing my<br/>&gt;&quot;Happy Birthday&quot; to Keenan Pepper both as a score and as MIDI files,<br/>&gt;and to others also for their suggestions, a fine example of Tuning<br/>&gt;List cooperation.
