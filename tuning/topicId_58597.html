You can have as many resource hungry programs running at once and it makes no difference at all. All that matters in XP is how much cpu power the programs use - and to some extent, how much memory they need, anyway it means XP is far more stable than 9x in my experience so far. It can hang if a program uses all the CPU power, or does something very memory intensive or some such just because that program is hogging everythign at a high priority and won&apos;t let anything else run - probably means the programmer has set that program to run at a very high priority which you should only do with great care in Windows.</p><p>A tip for FTS - if you select View | Custom List Boxes then it uses much less resources because it uses none at all for windows with lists on them. The only reason really for not having that preselected is that the custom list boxes don&apos;t get read properly by any users who interact with the program using a screen reader - and a couple of other very minor cosmetic differences. But again perhaps you&apos;ve already discovered that. It is still very easy to run out of resources - you don&apos;t need to use that much in Windows 9x to bring the entire operating system to a halt. You can even bring Windows 9x to a halt simply by showing a rather large number of those Explorer windows to show files. I can&apos;t remember how many now, quite a few but I think less than 100.</p><p>Thanks,</p><p>Robert</p></div><h3><a id=58601 href="#58601">ðŸ”—</a>Robert Walker &#x3C;robertwalker@ntlworld.com&#x3E;</h3><span>5/16/2005 6:40:00 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Hi Gene,</p><p>Just to mention one thing. Most of the gigs seem<br/>to come locked into 12-et. But it is an easy<br/>thing to unlock it. Open the gig in GigaStudio<br/>Editor. Then go to the instrument bank. Right<br/>click on each instrument in turn, choose<br/>Properties, then set the pitch bend in semitones<br/>to 2. It will then be microtonally enabled and<br/>you then just need to route the notes around<br/>from Scala to Giga using Midi Yoke or if using<br/>XP, with MapleSound</p><p>Thanks,</p><p>Robert</p></div><h3><a id=58604 href="#58604">ðŸ”—</a>Guglielmo &#x3C;gugliel@guglielmomusic.com&#x3E;</h3><span>5/16/2005 7:52:49 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>In this discussion of using computer tools to work with microtonality -- recent changes to my email accounts make me unsure, but perhaps there was a successful post a few weeks ago about a new work ...</p><p>&quot;La Sinfonia del Giorno Santo&quot; (Holy Day Overture), a new work for orchestra using microtuning, and with a demo recording made with the latest version of gigasampler (gigastudio 3) and a variety of commercial samples, all of which are a little out of tune as mentioned before.</p><p>There is a sizeable mp3 recording here:<br/><a href="http://www.soundclick.com/util/DownloadSong.cfm?ID=2346155">http://www.soundclick.com/util/DownloadSong.cfm?ID=2346155</a></p><p>And a streaming version at lower bit rate (128 kbps) here:<br/><a href="http://www.soundclick.com/util/streamM3U.m3u?ID=2346155&q=Hi">http://www.soundclick.com/util/streamM3U.m3u?ID=2346155&q=Hi</a></p><p>Didn&apos;t really get amy comment about the tuning from the previous post (or missed it with my mail changes), but some of you with experience in listening to tunings might have apt comments about the success or failure!  I&apos;ve been treating this kind of microtonality as flexible intonation, but with reading this list soon maybe will start calling it some kind of 20-or-so unit scale, with several of the 12 et pitches used in a high and a low form about 22 cents apart.</p><p>Guglielmo</p></div>
