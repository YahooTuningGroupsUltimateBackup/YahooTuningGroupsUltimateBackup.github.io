I think we can all agree the more microtonal music the better for everyone!!</p><p>If you are interested and have the cash to purchase one of these fine devices please email me off list. First come, first served. If you don&apos;t use it for some reason I request that it be offered on the tuning list again.</p><p>Thanks,</p><p>Chris</p></div>
