It is included in the &quot;Five<br/>Lectures On The Piano&quot; or something titled like that.<br/>   It was found that the apparent increase in impedance at the bridge that<br/>results from slightly out of tune unisons will increase the sustain. The<br/>locking of the frequencies, which happens among the three strings, produces a<br/>clearer, longer sounding unison when there is a very slight discrepancy.<br/>This can explain why some machine tuners sound differently than others.  The<br/>attention to the micro-level of unison agreement pays off in a piano that has<br/>a clarity and sustain that it otherwise would not have.<br/>Regards,<br/>Ed Foote</p></div><h3><a id=2750 href="#2750">ðŸ”—</a>Patrick Pagano &#x3C;ppagano@xxxxxxxxx.xxxx&#x3E;</h3><span>5/8/1999 12:38:32 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>I agree that unisons can have a nice affect mini-out but you have to be careful which side of the phase you&apos;re on.<br/>P</p><p>Carl Lumma wrote:</p><p>&gt; From: Carl Lumma &lt;<a href="mailto:clumma@nni.com">clumma@nni.com</a>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;The modern, state of the art, tuning machines produce consistant tunings<br/>&gt; &gt;with a tolerance of .1 cent.
