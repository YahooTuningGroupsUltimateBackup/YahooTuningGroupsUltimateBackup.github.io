This is going to be very<br/>&gt; useful.</p><p>&gt; I believe that, as long as we deal with slow alap-s in voice, it is<br/>&gt; going to be relatively simple.  I will read the details in your<br/>&gt; posting carefully and come back if I have any queries.</p><p>Thanks, I&apos;m glad to hear this. I will greatly value your comments<br/>on it, and any queries.</p><p>BTW I&apos;ve greatly enjoyed Veena Sarabuddhe&apos;s singing and I also tried<br/>the Alap exercises in the clip, and had some fun &quot;jamming along&quot; with<br/>one of her songs on my base recorder. Nice as I don&apos;t usually find it<br/>that easy to pick things up by ear. John Starret brought it to my<br/>attention with a posting to crazy music.</p><p>I should perhaps say this is a very rough first impression of what<br/>I hope eventually the program will be able to do. At present it is<br/>missing most of the inflections of pitch at the start and end of the note,<br/>and also any that might occur during a long sustained note.</p><p>I&apos;ve focussed on getting it to find the notes in a sound clip<br/>at all as a first step.</p><p>When used in real time the line in my program showing the pitch<br/>varies as the pitch of the note changes, so I&apos;m not sure, but<br/>it may well be possible to find the more subtle inflections too.</p><p>I&apos;m gradually learning with the program, and finding how best to<br/>use it, and what things it is useful to ask it to find in the<br/>waveform.</p><p>Robert</p></div><h3>Haresh BAKSHI &#x3C;hareshbakshi@hotmail.com&#x3E;</h3><span>7/18/2001 10:49:08 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In tuning@y..., &quot;Robert Walker&quot; &lt;robertwalker@n...&gt; wrote:</p><p>....................</p><p>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; BTW I&apos;ve greatly enjoyed Veena Sarabuddhe&apos;s singing and I also<br/>tried the Alap exercises in the clip, and had some fun &quot;jamming<br/>along&quot; with one of her songs on my base recorder.

I am<br/>making this request to know whether, Indian music, performed in any<br/>particular way (or ways), will suit jamming better.</p><p>Would jamming go better with instrumental Indian music?  With/without<br/>taal? Tempo: slow/fast? Some raga-s more suitable than some others?<br/>etc. etc.</p><p>Thanks in advance,<br/>Haresh.</p></div>
