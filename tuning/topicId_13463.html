Of<br/>course, other systems are not &quot;in tune,&quot; either...are they somehow<br/>harmful? I have<br/>seen various people mention, over the years, that just intonation is a<br/>natural tuning...does this mean music in this system is inherently<br/>beneficial? Or, again, is the intent, the passion, of the player, a<br/>significant part of the mix as well?</p><p>To me, music is like some great multidimensional mobile! And I tend to<br/>see tuning as just one fascinating dimension of that mobile... I see<br/>pitch space as a clean slate where the various tunings I use are a<br/>phantasmagoric myriad of translucent skeletal architectures. And<br/>logarithmic tunings, linear series, and you-name-it all flicker there<br/>like strange constellations on a clear winter&apos;s night sky.</p><p>Here &quot;unity&quot; and &quot;opposition&quot; are often friends... birds of a feather.</p><p>Charles Ives&apos; teeming polychromatic prisms; the Housatonic, the Fourth<br/>Symphony Finale... these were the first things I ever heard in music<br/>that really sounded like this... it really was music as I had long<br/>hoped to hear it. And to this day I still marvel at the potential of<br/>the Ives model; its largeness and its flexibility... its ability to<br/>embrace intuitive wherewithal and vast designs on something like equal<br/>ground...</p><p>There&apos;s a lot of great Ives quotes (especially in the &quot;Memos&quot;), but<br/>the one that ends his preface to the 4th Symphony&apos;s Comedy is one of<br/>my very favorites:</p><p>&quot;The future of music may not lie entirely with music itself, but<br/>rather in the way it makes itself a part with -- in the way it<br/>encourages and extends, rather than limits, the aspirations and ideals<br/>of the people -- the finer things that humanity does and dreams of.&quot;</p><p>  - dan</p></div><h3>Monz &#x3C;MONZ@JUNO.COM&#x3E;</h3><span>9/25/2000 11:17:31 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@egroups.com">tuning@egroups.com</a>, &quot;D.Stearns&quot; &lt;STEARNS@C...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt; <a href="http://www.egroups.com/message/tuning/13463">http://www.egroups.com/message/tuning/13463</a><br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; ...
