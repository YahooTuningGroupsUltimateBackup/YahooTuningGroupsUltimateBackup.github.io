One way of doing this was to concentrate on<br/>&gt; &gt; the note I was singing, and ignore the new one coming from the keyboard:)<br/>&gt; &gt; Otherwise, it did sound like the note I was singing rose.  I attribute<br/>&gt; &gt; this to the increased amount of high-pitched sound reaching my ears.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Jerry<br/>&gt; High pitched sound? Can you be specific?</p><p>One thing that I looked around for in this discussion was some kind of<br/>sum or difference tone explanation for a preference for a high third. As<br/>close as I could come to anything was that the sum tone of the 5:4<br/>and 3:2 is an 11:4, which is both a &apos;non-Western&apos; and &apos;strong&apos; overtone.<br/>Unfortunately, trying to tune the sum tone to something &quot;rational&quot;<br/>resulted in extremely high thirds and I abandoned that particular<br/>numerological path.</p><p>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; 2) The pitch really did rise.  This tended to be to around 9:7 or 19:15,<br/>&gt; &gt; or some inconsistent point around 400 cents.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Welcome to the twilight zone.</p><p>If the theory I&apos;d been pursuing made sense then this would have been<br/>the result of trying to get the 11:4 out of its pocket.</p><p>&gt; &gt; By consciously correcting for the sharpening, I even hit some kind of<br/>&gt; &gt; neutral third once:)<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Hold it right there! &quot;Neutral&quot; third? What&apos;s that?</p><p>For instance, 11:9 = 1.22222, not quite minor, certainly not major. I<br/>believe some of the thirds used in Arab vocal music are in this region.<br/>What is very interesting to me is that there is a common scale with<br/>both a &apos;major&apos; and &apos;minor&apos; third in it (bottom four notes would be<br/>considered 1 b2 b3 3 in our system). However, the pitches are all<br/>somewhat &quot;down&quot; from our orientation, perhaps 1 21/20 7/6 11/9???</p><p>Can one of our Maqam experts give a comment here?</p><p>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; I don&apos;t know if this is stronger<br/>&gt; &gt; than normal in me because, although I&apos;m a keyboard player of sorts, I&apos;ve<br/>&gt; &gt; been mostly using meantone for a couple of years now.  This may explain<br/>&gt; &gt; where all the 7-prime limit intervals came from.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Could be. Maybe you&apos;re not as &quot;bluesy&quot; as I thought. :-)</p><p>Some meantone tunings have very good &quot;septimal&quot; intervals in some keys.</p><p>&quot;Blues notes&quot; are really interesting and we have had some discussion<br/>with Monz on the topic. I&apos;m pretty happy with the blue seventh being<br/>around 7:4, but I&apos;m less confident in the &quot;flat five&quot; and the blue<br/>third (7:5 and 7:6 could be logical guesses, but I think that the<br/>blue third is more of a neutral third, and the b5 can be just about<br/>anywhere...</p><p>Thanks for the uncsientific study Graham.</p><p>Bob Valentine</p></div><h3>Paul H.
