Did you notice that 385=5*7*11 can function as a 3? Once you allow yourself to think in that way, the eikosany looks very different.</p><p>&gt;   The eikosany allows certain structural possibilities and gives<br/>&gt; to each note a unique function in relationship to the whole. for<br/>&gt; instance the 1-3-5 will function harmonically as these three<br/>&gt; factors but function subharmonically as a a 7, a 9 and a 11 in<br/>&gt; relationship to other tones.</p><p>What does &quot;function subharmonically&quot; mean?</p><p>&gt;   Yes you can divide it into 2,  3 parts and 6 parts and even<br/>&gt; get cubes which says allot about its multidimensional space.</p><p>But which multidimensional space? The 11-limit is rank five, which means the lattice of pitch classes is in a four dimensional space. But if you allow 385~384, so that the product 5*7*11 functions also as a 3, the space is reduced by one dimension, and the eikosany can be seen as a construct of pitch classes in three dimensions. In the middle of it, not part of the eikosany but exactly centrally located and with a dominating connection to the eikosany as a whole, is 9. The scale I gave, which plugs the hole in the middle, simply adds 9 to the eikosany.</p><p>&gt;   If one wants it to be tonal one has only to hold a note , any<br/>&gt; note.</p><p>A drone is hardly the most sophisticated way of introducing tonality. I think putting the 3x3 Euler genus (&quot;Genus chromaticum veterum correctum&quot;) in the middle of it all with the rest symmetrically arranged around it changes the whole picture as far as tonality is concerned.</p><p>&gt;   Once you reduce the structure to any 1/1 or spell it with<br/>&gt; reduced ratios i am afraid you would lose track of where you<br/>&gt; are.</p><p>I don&apos;t see why, but you can add the 9, and then adopt a rule that 385 can be equated with 3. That&apos;s obviously more confusing than pure JI but that&apos;s the way the cookie then crumbles, as the approximation in question is sitting there in the notes of the scale in the form of the Euler genus, and etc, whether you acknowledge them or not; your ear will insist that a fifth 4.5 cents flat is a fifth of some kind.</p><p>You can look at things in terms of the 7-limit JI lattice, with 11 coming in as 384/35, which is in the 3/35 pitch class, a note on the opposite side of a hexany from 1 and hence not complex at all.</p><p>Of course you can also temper everything, for instance by 284edo, where the fifth is now half a cent flat and the whole issue of two kinds of fifth in your scale goes away.</p></div><h3><a id=92009 href="#92009">ðŸ”—</a>Kraig Grady &#x3C;kraiggrady@...&#x3E;</h3><span>8/25/2010 6:58:09 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Re: The Eikosany&apos;s tonal center</p><p>Gene~<br/>In order to avoid a point by point argument<br/> This should at least confirm that what you are talking about was considered<br/> page 31of <a href="http://anaphoria.com/dal.PDF">http://anaphoria.com/dal.PDF</a> shows the small interval and how they conflict on a 31 tone mapping</p><p>If you then look at the <a href="http://anaphoria.com/xen11.PDF">http://anaphoria.com/xen11.PDF</a>   [ The article was written in a haste at a time in which i was working long hours.] you will see on the marimba i indeed did temper out one of these small intervals in the middle of the marimba bar 23 [ for fans of numerology].

I would understand how this would appeal to some. The goal was to have instruments where other traditional instruments could be added  to play along with it and it seemed all the help one could get would be needed.</p><p> So I decided for going for the pure version to give as many acoustical cues as possible .also no one had heard it and i was the first to tune up the full dallesandro CPS with James Wyness being the only other person i know who has.</p><p>It is conjecture at this point what would happen to such a microtemperment of this structure on either of our parts.<br/> It is like the &quot;humanize&apos; function on many software programs. It shifts everything slightly, but what happens if we try to humanize the humanize, and what is the limit before it causes problems.</p><p>We can all witness the Midi standard where tuning of 768[?] seemed like it would solve all.<br/> surely a difference of no more than a cent and a half could make any difference.<br/> It has been one of the greatest mistakes this field has endured and maybe set it back 30 years.</p><p>Certain aspects of working with this material are more apparent when one works with it on a day to day level.<br/>I remember a discussion of putting a 22 tone scale a conventional keyboard and the list decided that it was better to skip the two notes at the end of the second octave in order to have the appearance look the same.</p><p> That i had and used two such keyboards daily for years were ignored and the fact that many thing would no longer be possible, such as perfect fifths in one hand matter little.</p><p>There were many assumption i made and for all practical purposes seemed correct about the eikosany.<br/> It was only by working with the material did certain things come up and kick me in the face.<br/>What i put up i did in order to having others not to fall into the same traps as myself.</p><p> I placed the 1-3-7-9-11-15 22 tone eikosany in three different keyboard patterns over the years and the final one was thought to be the worse by the list and would still appear so.

Erv has a lot of nifty diagrams of the eikosany and other scales as regular graphs, but I don&apos;t see anything relevant to my comments. I suppose two regular graph diagrams, one showing the JI relationships you get when adding 9 to the eikosany and the other showing the full complement of 385/384 tempered intervals might be illuminating.</p><p>385/384 tempering is quite a lot more accurate than 31et is able to demonstrate; you can get the error of the 11-limit to within two cents. But I wouldn&apos;t call it microtempering. My point however is that even if you do no tempering at all, a fifth flat by 385/384 is going to sound like a fifth. Hence after adding 9 you have a 21-note just intonation scale, with a clearly audible 9-note Euler genus in the middle of it dominating things so far as tonal centering goes, even though some of the fifths are flat by 4.5 cents (about 1/5 comma) and others are just. From that point of view the eikosany is a scale where the natural choice for 1/1 was omitted, rendering it more fragmented and tonally ambiguous.</p></div><h3><a id=92011 href="#92011">ðŸ”—</a>sevishmusic &#x3C;sevish@...&#x3E;</h3><span>8/26/2010 1:37:11 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Kraig,</p><p>you mentioned that Eikosanies should not be reduced to an octave, because it makes the patterns harder to understand.

I would understand how this would appeal to some.<br/>&gt; The goal was to have instruments where other traditional<br/>&gt; instruments could be added  to play along with it and it seemed<br/>&gt; all the help one could get would be needed.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;   So I decided for going for the pure version to give as many<br/>&gt; acoustical cues as possible .also no one had heard it and i was<br/>&gt; the first to tune up the full dallesandro CPS with James Wyness<br/>&gt; being the only other person i know who has.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; It is conjecture at this point what would happen to such a<br/>&gt; microtemperment of this structure on either of our parts.<br/>&gt;   It is like the &quot;humanize&apos; function on many software programs.<br/>&gt; It shifts everything slightly, but what happens if we try to<br/>&gt; humanize the humanize, and what is the limit before it causes<br/>&gt; problems.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; We can all witness the Midi standard where tuning of 768[?]<br/>&gt; seemed like it would solve all.<br/>&gt;   surely a difference of no more than a cent and a half could<br/>&gt; make any difference.<br/>&gt;   It has been one of the greatest mistakes this field has<br/>&gt; endured and maybe set it back 30 years.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Certain aspects of working with this material are more apparent<br/>&gt; when one works with it on a day to day level.<br/>&gt; I remember a discussion of putting a 22 tone scale a<br/>&gt; conventional keyboard and the list decided that it was better to<br/>&gt; skip the two notes at the end of the second octave in order to<br/>&gt; have the appearance look the same.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;   That i had and used two such keyboards daily for years were<br/>&gt; ignored and the fact that many thing would no longer be<br/>&gt; possible, such as perfect fifths in one hand matter little.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; There were many assumption i made and for all practical purposes<br/>&gt; seemed correct about the eikosany.<br/>&gt;   It was only by working with the material did certain things<br/>&gt; come up and kick me in the face.<br/>&gt; What i put up i did in order to having others not to fall into<br/>&gt; the same traps as myself.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;   I placed the 1-3-7-9-11-15 22 tone eikosany in three different<br/>&gt; keyboard patterns over the years and the final one was thought<br/>&gt; to be the worse by the list and would still appear so.

You could try working your way up from the bottom: first find the 5-limit triads, then the 7-limit tetrads, and then add the 9 and 11 limit stuff. It would depend, I suppose, on how you work, but if you feed this scale, with or without the added 6/5, into Scala and do &quot;show location&quot; on various sorts of chords you will get listings for the chords in question, which might help. As I remarked, you can break it apart in the 5-limit into two &quot;wings&quot; and a central region, and you could try to find these, though the central region doesn&apos;t make much sense unless you add the 6/5.</p><p>&gt;   0:          1/1               0.000  unison, perfect prime<br/>&gt;   1:         33/32             53.273  undecimal comma, al-Farabi&apos;s 1/4-tone<br/>&gt;   2:         21/20             84.467  minor semitone<br/>&gt;   3:         11/10            165.004  4/5-tone, Ptolemy&apos;s second<br/>&gt;   4:          9/8             203.910  major whole tone<br/>&gt;   5:          7/6             266.871  septimal minor third<br/>6/5 &quot;center note&quot;<br/>&gt;   6:         99/80            368.914<br/>&gt;   7:         77/60            431.875<br/>&gt;   8:         21/16            470.781  narrow fourth<br/>&gt;   9:         11/8             551.318  undecimal semi-augmented fourth<br/>&gt;  10:          7/5             582.512  septimal or Huygens&apos; tritone, BP fourth<br/>&gt;  11:        231/160           635.785<br/>&gt;  12:          3/2             701.955  perfect fifth<br/>&gt;  13:         63/40            786.422  narrow minor sixth<br/>&gt;  14:         77/48            818.189<br/>&gt;  15:         33/20            866.959<br/>&gt;  16:          7/4             968.826  harmonic seventh<br/>&gt;  17:          9/5            1017.596  just minor seventh, BP seventh<br/>&gt;  18:         11/6            1049.363  21/4-tone, undecimal neutral seventh<br/>&gt;  19:         77/40           1133.830<br/>&gt;  20:          2/1            1200.000  octave<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; As a beginner, should I avoid using this Eikosany?</p><p>Why?</p><p>&gt; Besides this I am having many troubles writing my first piece of music using any Eikosany.

In any case, it&apos;s a aid towards analyzing relationships.</p><p>&quot;The eikosany can be split into three sections, the central portion and two symmetrically located wings, the seven wing and the eleven wing.

Hence after adding 9 you<br/>have a 21-note just intonation scale, with a clearly audible 9-note Euler genus<br/>in the middle of it dominating things so far as tonal centering goes, even<br/>though some of the fifths are flat by 4.5 cents (about 1/5 comma) and others are<br/>just.

In an octave equivalent sense, 9 is approximately the &quot;square root&quot; of 10395 in the sense that 81 is complementary to 385/3 (10395/81 = 385/3) and 385/3 is approximately 128, which is equivalent to 1.</p><p>Wilson_16 is another scale which it would make a lot of sense to temper via miracle.
