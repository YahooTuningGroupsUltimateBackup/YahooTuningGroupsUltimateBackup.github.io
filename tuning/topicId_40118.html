It&apos;s the first time I&apos;ve read that batch.<br/>Pretty readable, too.  I had absolutely *no* idea that Partch&apos;s ideas<br/>and scales went through so many iterations during his lifetime.</p><p>I have *no* idea of the accuracy of the scholarship.  There seems a<br/>fair amount of it, and it seems pretty carefully researched.</p><p>Jon, what do you think of it?  Or is it hard to be objective with<br/>your feelings about McLaren?</p><p>Seriously, Jon, I have *absolutely* no idea what you&apos;re going to say<br/>about this.</p><p>(Monz must like these pages, since he&apos;s linked the stuff pretty<br/>prominently...)</p><p>(Isn&apos;t it nice, sometimes, to ask a question when you *really* don&apos;t<br/>know the answer to it beforehand.... :)</p><p>Joe Pehrson</p></div>
