Alan Bush, writing in the Introduction to Erno Lendvai&apos;s book, &apos;Bela<br/>Bartok, An introduction to his music&apos; (re Schoenberg&apos;s dictum that<br/>consonance and dissonance are exactly equivalent):</p><p>&quot;Of course dissonance is equivalent to consonance in the sense that both are<br/>perfectly permissible ingredients of musical art&quot;</p><p>2. Myself, (sorry) on rec.music.theory, many moons ago</p><p>I find that notions of &apos;consonance&apos; and dissonance&apos; don&apos;t help in a general<br/>musical context, and I prefer &apos;dynamic&apos; and &apos;static&apos;, implying that the<br/>former is &apos;in motion&apos; and the latter &apos;at rest&apos;. Any kind of sonority can be<br/>either, depending upon several factors all based on context.</p><p>Musical sonorities often behave like particles in Newtonian Mechanics (and<br/>possibly Relativistic Mechanics), and have velocity, mass, inertia and<br/>momentum, and consequently kinetic and potential energy. When considered in<br/>this way, these sonorities have a much more &apos;plastic&apos; quality, free from<br/>&apos;absolutes&apos; which can obscure or defeat the very intentions of the composer.</p><p>My &apos;3&apos;&cent; worth</p><p>Mark G</p></div>
