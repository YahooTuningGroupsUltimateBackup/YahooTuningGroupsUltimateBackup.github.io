I hereby nominate this kind of notation<br/>&gt; to describe any equal-temperament of any interval.</p><p>The purely mathematical description may be the most<br/>flexible and descriptive of all.</p><p>An interesting argument Brian McLaren made with me<br/>(disclaimer: I&apos;m paraphrasing... not a quote) was that<br/>&quot;mathematics has absolutely nothing to do with music,<br/>except that it can be used to devise interesting tunings&quot;.</p><p>So if we recognize this as valid, then the one thing<br/>math is good for in music-theory is to describe the<br/>nature of the tuning.  So...</p><p>&gt; Why not just avoid it and use something better that can<br/>&gt; stand for the 13th root of 3 just as well as the 72nd root<br/>&gt; of 2?</p><p>I propose 3^(i/13) and 2^(i/72).</p><p>i stands for &quot;integer&quot;, so that it defines those certain<br/>particular categories of tunings that you would prefer<br/>I don&apos;t call EDOs and EDNOs.</p><p>(Or should I be using z?  See<br/>&lt;<a href="http://www.iwu.edu/~lstout/BasicTerminology/node2.html">http://www.iwu.edu/~lstout/BasicTerminology/node2.html</a>&gt;.</p><p>And I admit with ^() it&apos;s much more awkward,<br/>but I still think it&apos;s best of all.</p><p>&gt; Why not n-EDk ?  144-EDO would be 144-ED2</p><p>Or 2^(i/144).</p><p>&gt; and the 17th root of 5 would be 17-ED5.</p><p>Or 5^(i/17).</p><p>  Or if need be,  n-EDk/m?  So a 7/5 equally<br/>&gt; divided into 7 parts would be 7-ED7/5.</p><p>Or (7/5)^(i/7).</p><p>&gt; Go for maximum flexibilty in the formulas.<br/>&gt; Aaron</p><p>Ah, now we come to the real power of my new idea.<br/>How about this?:</p><p>The beauty of the format I&apos;m proposing here<br/>is that you can have a whole system of<br/>alphabetical abbreviations to specify what<br/>kind of structure the tuning has, which give<br/>a lot more flexibility and specificity to the<br/>categories we had labeled UDO and UDNO,<br/>especially the latter.  That always seemed<br/>to me like such a gigantic catch-all category.<br/>This system breaks it up into several different<br/>subcategories.</p><p>So, EDOs are always of the form 2^(i/i). (right?)</p><p>And if I&apos;m not mistaken, n is for &quot;natural number&quot;<br/>which is the big superset of number categories.</p><p>Would the mathematicians be kind enough to drop on<br/>us a list of standard algebraic abbreviations for<br/>different kinds of numbers?  I thought i was<br/>integer, but I&apos;m guessing at all of this.  Also<br/>please say whatever needs to be said about the<br/>information on that webpage<br/>&lt;<a href="http://www.iwu.edu/~lstout/BasicTerminology/node2.html">http://www.iwu.edu/~lstout/BasicTerminology/node2.html</a>&gt;.</p><p>And EDNOs could have a number of different<br/>formulas to describe them.</p><p>For example, 2^(PI/38) creates an interesting<br/>meantone-like tuning in which the generator<br/>is ~99.2081891 cents and the &quot;5th&quot; is<br/>~694.4573234 cents.  Under the 1999 classification<br/>this would be an EDNO.</p><p>PI is a transcendental number, so I suppose we<br/>could call it t, if indeed we need anything shorter<br/>than PI itself.  Under this new classification<br/>it would be a 2^(t/38), or in even more general<br/>terms, a 2^(t/i), or even an i^(t/i).  Or perhaps<br/>even more generally, i^(r), an integer to a rational<br/>power.</p><p>So isn&apos;t it strange how it looks like an<br/>&quot;octave&quot;-based tuning in the new notation,<br/>but is specified as NO in the other one.<br/>(I&apos;m sure that the mathematicians can step<br/>in and explain what&apos;s happening here.)</p><p>-monz<br/><a href="http://www.monz.org">http://www.monz.org</a><br/>&quot;All roads lead to n^0&quot;</p></div><h3><a id=23026 href="#23026">ðŸ”—</a>D.Stearns &#x3C;STEARNS@CAPECOD.NET&#x3E;</h3><span>5/17/2001 3:18:18 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Hi Aaron,</p><p>Just for the record I came up with the EDO acronym as way to try and<br/>distinguish between tempering and the intentionally free use of equal<br/>tunings.
