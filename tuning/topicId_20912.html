I also realized that a computer music system had the potential to do so more or less instantaneously and thus free music from the compromise of equal temperament.</p><p>What my software does is provide the performer with an opportunity to make that switch to a new key tuning at a moment of their choice (by clicking a note on-screen or via an external pedal board or keyboard using a MIDI channel for the purpose).  The software will then instantly re-tune using the current pitch of the new key note but treating it as the tonic of the new scale.</p><p>What it does not do is adjust the pitch of individual notes in the context of the chord they are part of.  Unless you select the option to re-tune then the notes of chords will retain their tuning relative to the current key and tuning (just, mean-tone, well tempered, whatever).</p><p>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;If you were to modulate through a series of keys on key notes corresponding<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;with those degrees of the original scale and re-tune to the new key note in<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;each case then for both examples you would arrive back at in the original<br/>&gt; &gt;key at a slightly flatter pitch (assuming JI).<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;OK -- some people might have a problem with that, while others might not.<br/>&gt;But what if you didn&apos;t modulate.

I am a software engineer with a deep love of music and have written my software on the basis of ideas that have been around for a long time.  I will try to catch up with some of the latest ideas in future versions.</p><p>with regards,<br/>Peter Frazer.<br/><a href="http://www.midicode.com">www.midicode.com</a></p></div><h3>Paul H.

If you don&apos;t switch tuning to a new key note then in terms of the tuning the intervals will be as you would expect in the tunings you have selected.  If you want to know what it sounds like, please listen to it.  The download is free (demo version) and takes about 10 minutes.</p><p>Peter Frazer.<br/><a href="http://www.midicode.com">www.midicode.com</a></p></div><h3>Paul H.
