Which prompted other questions such as: When we improvise on<br/>instruments tuned to a certain tuning, how does the tuning affect the<br/>improvisational moment-to-moment choices that we make? I&apos;m<br/>certain<br/>that it&apos;s way too subjective of a thing to ever be universally<br/>quantified. I&apos;ve realized long ago from analysis of my own<br/>improvisational style on the 12 tET piano, that I have always seemed<br/>to avoid the major 3rd. It&apos;s so obvious to me now why I made this<br/>kind of choice Â– because of the interval being so grossly out of<br/>tune<br/>from the just 5/4. But when I&apos;m playing an instrument that&apos;s<br/>got a<br/>purely tuned 5/4 major 3rd (or many other possible just major 3rds)<br/>my fingers will happily gravitate to this interval. I have in the<br/>past conducted a few simple tests with improvising musicians who<br/>normally play 12 tET instruments. I have got them to set down and<br/>improvise on a justly tuned piano, without any preparation or<br/>explanation of the way the keyboard is tuned, so that I could observe<br/>the spontaneous intervallic choices they would make. I just wanted<br/>their ear to dictate what sounded correct to them with a first<br/>exposure to a given tuning. I did not get particularly analytical<br/>about what I saw and heard, but suffice it to say that when we<br/>discussed their improvisation, it was obvious that the musicians<br/>found that the new sounds under their fingers did indeed make them<br/>make choices that they would have never made on a 12 tET tuned<br/>instrument. Perhaps the deviations from the acoustic intervals in 12<br/>tET are a huge part of what has influenced stylistic concepts in all<br/>12 tET musics Â– such as the nervous need to modulate<br/>&quot;all-over-hell-<br/>and-back&quot;. I do think it would be very revealing to take this<br/>kind of<br/>test to a more analytical level though, and make some midi recordings<br/>of improvising with unique tunings without the musician knowing<br/>what&apos;s going on with the tuning of the instrument beforehand, and<br/>be<br/>able to look at the overall results of the melodic/harmonic intervals<br/>chosen. It would be great if there was some software that could<br/>achieve this kind of analysis of a midi file, by allowing you to<br/>input the intervals of the tuning that was used, then be able to look<br/>inside of the moment-to-moment choices that a 12 tET improviser made<br/>during a first exposure to the tuning Â– and be able to quantify<br/>the<br/>choices. Two things it might reveal are the deficits of 12 tET and<br/>the strengths of the tuning used Â– providing intuitive<br/>information<br/>based on improvisation. Perhaps a &quot;12 Tetter&quot; would gravitate<br/>to<br/>things that are better than what they are used to. Has anyone ever<br/>tried something similar to this? Any thoughts?</p><p>Regards,</p><p>Jacky</p></div>
