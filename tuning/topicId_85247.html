I love it! I&apos;m excited whenever I hear some new microtonal (macrotonal in your case I guess ;)) music in a different genre. It can be disappointing hearing the same microtonal stuff with no variety. But man! I know a lot of people into dub and reggae, a lot of my friends. They would love this stuff more than me. Finally it&apos;s something I can play to them and say &quot;look, THIS is that microtonal thing I&apos;ve been telling you about!&quot;</p><p>There&apos;s some really nice detail in this music. I also noticed good attention to detail on the webpage where I downloaded the mp3s from, the hyperlinks were in red yellow and green! So I&apos;ll put these tracks on my mp3 player and listen to them tonight when I go out for a spliff.</p><p>Well... This is a good fusion that&apos;s hard to come by, so keep us up to date on how you&apos;re doing. ;) I&apos;m ready to support this stuff.</p><p>All the best,</p><p>Sean</p><p>--- In tuning@...m, &quot;freq_divider&quot; &lt;dubshot@...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; hi everybody,<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; i&apos;ve been working on a dub album. it has mostly classic reggae basslines and melodies &apos;transposed&apos; so to speak to gamelan-like harmonies. it&apos;s electronic stuff with lots of dub fx<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; the album is not out yet but there are already some tunes available for free in either mp3/128 format over here<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; <a href="http://www.xs4all.nl/~dubshot/">http://www.xs4all.nl/~dubshot/</a> (the tunes marked with an asterisk)<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; or in 16 bit wav format over here<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; <a href="http://soundcloud.com/tony-dubshot">http://soundcloud.com/tony-dubshot</a><br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; the album, titled &apos;dub experryments&apos; will be released early 2010 both as free mp3s and as a limited edition numbered cd (250 copies) that will be available via e-bay.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; if you want the full album please check back on my blog, which is here<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; <a href="http://dubshot.blogspot.com/">http://dubshot.blogspot.com/</a><br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; in januari or februari 2010<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; greetings, anton<br/>&gt;</p></div>
