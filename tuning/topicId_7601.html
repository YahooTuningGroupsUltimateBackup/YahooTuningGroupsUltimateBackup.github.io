I also understand how this would<br/>&gt;be a particular problem in relation to the way Schubert structures his<br/>&gt;harmonies.  However, if Paul Erlich would like to go into this question in<br/>&gt;further detail, as he suggested, I would find it very interesting...</p><p>It seems like you&apos;ve got the picture now, so I don&apos;t know what you&apos;d like me<br/>to discuss. So I&apos;ll try to give you a sense of why meantone (and thus<br/>Vicentino&apos;s JI scheme) works for anything in the Western repertoire without<br/>enharmonic respellings, and what happens when you do have enharmonic<br/>respellings. Basically, there are only two independent commas that come into<br/>play when trying to analyze or render music of the Western conservatory<br/>tradition in just intonation. Let&apos;s take the syntonic comma and the<br/>Pythagorean comma as the two basic ones (any two would do). The syntonic<br/>comma is four fifths minus a third, so we can write it as s=4v-t. The<br/>Pythagorean comma is twelve fifths; write it as p=12v. Other important<br/>commas:</p><p>1. schisma = -8v-t = s-p<br/>2. diaschisma = -4v-2t = 2*s-p<br/>3. (minor or Great) diesis = -3t = 3*s-p<br/>4. major diesis = 4v-4t = 4*s-p</p><p>If you think there might be others, check out Mathieu&apos;s _Harmonic<br/>Experience_, which is a thorough survey of Western harmony through JI<br/>glasses. Mathieu does not mention the &quot;major diesis&quot; but he does name one<br/>other, the &quot;superdiesis&quot;, which is 8v-2t = 2*s. But basically, we&apos;ve got it<br/>all covered.</p><p>Structurally, the syntonic comma results in no notational change, while the<br/>Pythagorean comma changes a flat to the enharmonic sharp (e.g., Ab-&gt;G#).<br/>(You may want to verify this for yourself). From the equations above, we can<br/>see that commas 1-4 above all result in a notational change opposite that of<br/>the Pythagorean comma, i.e. they change a sharp to the enharmonic flat.</p><p>So, in any music which does not involve an enharmonic respelling, the only<br/>comma that comes into play is the syntonic comma (and perhaps multiples such<br/>as the &quot;superdiesis&quot;). As you probably know, the syntonic comma is already<br/>an equivalence relation in meantone tuning. Therefore, this music always<br/>&quot;works&quot; in meantone with absolutely no shifts or drifts. Triads in meantone<br/>have major thirds in JI, and minor thirds and fifths 1/4-comma (5.4&#xFFFD;) off<br/>JI. So an adaptive JI scheme for this music could take meantone as its<br/>starting point, tweak half of the notes by 5.4&#xFFFD; to produce JI harmonies, and<br/>the largest melodic shifts introduced would be 0+5.4 = 5.4&#xFFFD;, an inaudible<br/>melodic interval.</p><p>Once the music makes use of enharmonic spelling, however, the situation is<br/>not so clear, but if we are to preserve the syntonic comma as a structural<br/>equivalence in our system, Fokker&apos;s formalism tells us that we are working<br/>with a closed 12-tone system (see my posts on Fokker periodicity blocks).<br/>For each of the commas above, when taken with the syntonic comma as a pair<br/>of unison vectors, define a 12-tone periodicity block:</p><p>syntonic comma &amp; Pythagorean comma:</p><p>| 4 -1|<br/>|     | = 4*0 - (12*(-1)) = 0 + 12 = 12<br/>|12  0|</p><p>syntonic comma &amp; major diesis:</p><p>| 4 -1|<br/>|     | = 4*(-4) - (4*(-1)) = -16 + 4 = -12<br/>| 4 -4|</p><p>syntonic comma &amp; diesis:</p><p>| 4 -1|<br/>|     | = 4*(-3) - (0*(-1)) = -12 + 0 = -12<br/>| 0 -3|</p><p>syntonic comma &amp; diaschisma:</p><p>| 4 -1|<br/>|     | = 4*(-2) - (-4*(-1)) = -8 - 4 = -12<br/>|-4 -2|</p><p>syntonic comma &amp; schisma:</p><p>| 4 -1|<br/>|     | = 4*(-1) - (-8*(-1)) = -4 - 8 = -12<br/>|-8 -1|</p><p>A geometrical way of looking at all this is to envision the infinite 2-d web<br/>of fifths and thirds. Equivalence at the syntonic comma rolls this web into<br/>an infinitely long cylinder, with the lines of fifths collapsed into a<br/>single helix, and with the thirds connecting notes in adjacent turns of the<br/>helix. This is of course the model of meantone temperament. Equivalence at<br/>any of the other commas then rolls the cylinder into a torus, a finite<br/>figure. The number of notes in this torus turns out to be 12.</p><p>So the only way to deal with such a pair of commas is to institute a closed<br/>12-tone tuning; if fixed-pitch, the &quot;wolves&quot; of such a tuning are of course<br/>minimized by using 12-tone equal temperament. If adaptive JI is used, one<br/>would independently retune each chord from 12-tET to JI. 12-tET of course<br/>has deviations of up to 16&#xFFFD; in its triadic intervals. If you consider 2&#xFFFD;<br/>deviations from JI insignificant, a closed system that I proposed several<br/>years ago on this list is the most efficient way to acheive adaptive JI that<br/>covers all commatic situations. The scheme involves two standard 12-tET<br/>keyboards, tuned 15&#xFFFD; apart. For major triads, put the root and fifth on the<br/>higher keyboard, and the third on the lower keyboard. For minor triads, put<br/>the root and fifth on the lower keyboard, and the third on the higher<br/>keyboard. Audible 15&#xFFFD; melodic shifts will be quite common, but that is the<br/>price you pay for incorporating the diesis (etc.) into the system as<br/>intervals of equivalence. One could view this system as a modern version of<br/>Vicentino&apos;s system, taking into account the proliferation of commas other<br/>than the syntonic in post-18th century music.</p></div><h3>Paul H.

However, in the approach to choas, oscillatory systems create<br/>fundamental frequencies, one at a time, that are subharmonics of the normal<br/>oscillating frequency. But the only frequencies present at a given point in<br/>time are the overtones of the fundamental &quot;subharmonic.&quot;</p><p>The very, very long answer is in the archives. Search for &quot;undertones&quot;,<br/>&quot;subharmonic series&quot;, you get the picture.</p><p>&gt;From what I think I am understanding, let&apos;s be moronically simplistic<br/>&gt;for a moment and start on &quot;middle C.&quot;  Then your UTONAL ratios would<br/>&gt;yield a C below then an F, then a C, then an Ab, then an F... your<br/>&gt;&quot;F-minor triad...&quot;</p><p>&gt;But does this &quot;inverse ratio&quot; process really come from anything in<br/>&gt;nature??  Of course the &quot;minor triad&quot; is up the Otonal series at 6:7:9,<br/>&gt;but that has nothing to do with the Utonal, yes??</p><p>Right. The inverse ratio process can be said to be natural, since all notes<br/>share a common overtone, namely the Partchian &quot;Unity of the Utonality&quot;.</p><p>&gt;So does the Utonal ratio series really &quot;mean&quot; anything?? It seems there<br/>&gt;is a kind of &quot;descending series&quot; from &quot;difference tones,&quot; yes?? or does<br/>&gt;this have no relation to it???</p><p>No, difference tones tend to produce otonal series. At best, the &quot;natural&quot;<br/>property of otonalities is the reinforcement of a common overtone, which you<br/>can learn to hear, but whos relevance to music is questionable.</p><p>Complete Utonalities form a subset of the class of chords I call &quot;saturated<br/>chords&quot;, whose definition is closely related to the natural phenomenon of<br/>critical band dissonance. (Partch&apos;s one footed bride is a pretty good map of<br/>critical band dissonance for harmonic timbres [with many octave doublings],<br/>and at the same time, a pretty good map for octave-equivalent harmonic<br/>entropy [of dyads only]). See <a href="http://www.cix.co.uk/~gbreed/erlichs.htm">http://www.cix.co.uk/~gbreed/erlichs.htm</a> for<br/>more about utonalities and saturated chords.</p><p>&gt;Comments are encouraged... I would like to find an &quot;optimal&quot; tuning for<br/>this &gt;piece! Joseph Pehrson</p><p>Every piece can have its own optimal tuning, and the tuning need not be<br/>fixed-pitch -- it can be adaptive! John deLaubenfels is the man who could<br/>maybe help you at least calculate the optimal fixed tuning, if you give him<br/>a list of the intervals and chords you&apos;re trying to approximate.</p></div>
