As a very simple example I&apos;d<br/>say that if a 4:5:6:7 doesn&apos;t setup a sense of resolution in the<br/>intended (or perhaps even expected) way, then a structural fidelity<br/>(and certainly some will say much more than just a &quot;structural<br/>fidelity&quot;) to the original conception has been altered - and some will<br/>argue very much &quot;compromised.&quot;{1}</p><p>For some, these kinds of changes are either all for the better, or<br/>just not all that readily apparent (or just don&apos;t call any attention<br/>to themselves in a negative way)... but for others, these types of<br/>&quot;indiscretions&quot; can be aesthetically -- and sometimes ideologically --<br/>very bothersome... and I can understand that. Personally, I think<br/>you&apos;d have very few objections if you were using your own pieces...<br/>but I&apos;m actually all for what your doing as a way to learn what can be<br/>learned... as developing experimentation and ongoing study... But I<br/>guess that I&apos;d also say that I would think that a part of that<br/>&quot;ongoing study&quot; would probably have to involve the fielding and<br/>cogitating of the types of objections your seeing.</p><p>good luck,<br/>Dan</p><p>____________________<br/>{1} I think Paul Erlich made some excellent points (I&apos;m sure others<br/>have as well, but this bit of his really stuck in my mind) along these<br/>lines when he wrote, &quot;dissonant additions to chords in common-practice<br/>harmony are best analyzed in terms of their _linear_ function; that<br/>is, they acquire their musical meaning through their _melodic_ or<br/>_contrapuntal_ role as anticipations, suspensions, or (often the case<br/>with sevenths, flat ninths, or secondary leading tones) by supplying<br/>the classic tritone resolution&quot; (etc.).</p></div>
