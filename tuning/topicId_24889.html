We look like a chat room or something (hey, someone suggested<br/>&gt; forming a tuning chat room a long time ago . . . perhaps the time is ripe). Let&apos;s &quot;shape up&quot;!</p><p>Idea of tuning_gossip is a mailing list somewhere between a list and a chatroom<br/>- can talk about anything, no worries about post volulme as most members will<br/>be subscribed in no-email mode, or perhaps have a special tuning_gossip folder<br/>in their e-mail program.</p><p>As for chat room proper, I&apos;ve just tried out the TL chatroom, and Graham was<br/>there, and it worked well - talked about his MOS applet. It&apos;s great for<br/>that kind of thing as one gets instant responses in real time and can ask<br/>how something works, or what it does, etc.</p><p>Sometimes one sees a ding-dong of posts to TL where both correspondents are<br/>clearly on line at once, and working something out together or whatever.<br/>In that situation, one could say let&apos;s go over to the chat-room to<br/>get it all sorted out, and anyone else on-line at the time could<br/>go over to it too and join in if they want.</p><p>For other more leisurely posts, or things of light hearted nature, jokes<br/>etc, which are nice things to say, but one hesitates maybe because one<br/>doesn&apos;t want to add to volume of TL posts, one can post them to<br/>tuning_gossip.</p><p>Also nothing on tuning_gossip would be off-topic - basically a place<br/>for microtonalists to gather, so if conversation wanders to<br/>other areas, not directly to do with tuning, that&apos;s okay too,<br/>and one could say &quot;let&apos;s go to tuning_gossip&quot; for those types of<br/>topics too.</p><p>Robert</p></div>
