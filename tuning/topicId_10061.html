The other side of the board has 5 bass<br/>guitar strings 80 cm from nut to bridge also tuned in commonly tuned<br/>intervals.  On the board below the strings I put a strip of cardboard<br/>with markings to indicate fingering of whatever tuning I want.</p><p>Have you made any recordings with any of the instruments that you&apos;ve<br/>made or microtonally altered? If so, I&apos;d love to hear them sometime,<br/>because the description you give here certainly piqued my interest.</p><p>You inspired me to go back and dig around, and I found about a dozen<br/>or so pieces that I&apos;ve composed in 13 over the years. I&apos;m going to try<br/>and hammer a couple of these into presentable shape and see if I can&apos;t<br/>get them up at J. Starrett&apos;s Tuning Punk site... interestingly, the<br/>majority of these pieces are based on odd (mostly non MOS, save some<br/>rotations of the 7 equal out of 13 equal 6L &amp; 1s) 7-tone scales, as<br/>their resulting incidental harmonies were still very easily manageable<br/>to my ear (or sensibility).</p><p>Dan</p></div>
