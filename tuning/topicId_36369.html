What little I<br/>&gt; have posted online here for the tuning list in the meantime, since<br/>&gt; starting offline discussions, only reflects my attempt to address and<br/>&gt; hopefully eliminate the self-contradictions and inconsistencies that<br/>&gt; since then we have unfortunately been unable to work out even<br/>&gt; offline. I have given up trying.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I had posted online my understanding of what Jerry has been trying to<br/>&gt; say, and Jerry confirmed it. Jerry has never produced an assessment<br/>&gt; of my views that even comes close, as I&apos;ve previously stated. Now I<br/>&gt; don&apos;t even know if that understanding is actually a correct<br/>&gt; reflection of what Jerry thinks, because since then there have been<br/>&gt; serious contradicions and/or changes(?), I can&apos;t be sure which.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Even so, both Paul and I have been told that our attempts to correct<br/>&gt; logical contradictions and fallacies are just a blind defense of our<br/>&gt; own positions (Paul&apos;s and my perspectives are not identical, as most<br/>&gt; of you know). Well, if there is any merit in Jerry&apos;s position,<br/>&gt; whatever it is, or even anything else new and independent of Jerry&apos;s<br/>&gt; position, maybe just a new way of looking at high thirds (the real<br/>&gt; ones Jerry proposes, that can be measured by frequency), I would be<br/>&gt; the among the first to want to know about and understand the<br/>&gt; phenomenon.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; As Paul has stated above, none of this has anything to do with my<br/>&gt; position. It has everything to do with untenable &quot;logical&quot; leaps and<br/>&gt; indecipherable self-contradictions. This is on top of being told I<br/>&gt; was simply stuck in a hardened position and that the attempts to<br/>&gt; correct logical contradictions, inconsistencies and fallacies are<br/>&gt; just an intensely defensive attempt to discredit Jerry&apos;s ideas. This<br/>&gt; has remained true in spite of restricting myself along with Paul to<br/>&gt; multiple attempts to establish coherent communications and lines of<br/>&gt; reasoning independent of &quot;positions&quot; or perceptions.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; It has become totally clear to me that I can say or do absolutely<br/>&gt; nothing to separate logic and substance or to disabuse Jerry of his<br/>&gt; assessment of my motivations, so I have confined myself to responding<br/>&gt; to new Jerries as they are posted with an honest description of my<br/>&gt; own perceptions.<br/>&gt;<br/>Fair enough, Bob. Your statement here is pretty much what I understood you<br/>to say during our off-list exchanges. And, if you don&apos;t mind, I&apos;ll be<br/>pleased just to leave this right here.</p><p>The real value to me is your interest in the possibility to learn something<br/>about this mysterious high third business. As I have said in an earlier post<br/>today, your contributions have already contributed to a very important<br/>observation for me. I&apos;m pleased that you will continue to respond to any<br/>upcoming aural examples.</p><p>Just don&apos;t try to &quot;fix&quot; my logic, please. As far as I&apos;m concerned, it&apos;s<br/>doing just fine.</p><p>Respectfully,</p><p>Jerry</p></div>
