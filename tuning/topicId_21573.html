I&apos;m sure many<br/>people on this list appreciate this important &quot;backup.&quot;  It works<br/>fine, too, as long as I stay in Internet Explorer.  Actually, I&apos;m<br/>very tired of Netscape since they are obviously trying to pay &quot;catch<br/>up&quot; with Internet Explorer and are failing miserably.  I&apos;m very<br/>disapointed with them, so reluctantly also joined the Bill Gates<br/>&quot;hegemony&quot; as I have with so many other programs...</p><p>Thanks again!</p><p>_________ _______ ____ _<br/>Joseph Pehrson</p></div><h3><a id=21633 href="#21633">ðŸ”—</a>Robert Walker &#x3C;robert_walker@rcwalker.freeserve.co.uk&#x3E;</h3><span>4/26/2001 3:30:43 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Hi Joseph,</p><p>I&apos;d like to make the archive work in Netscape as well if I can!<br/>I did it with the small size of tables and it made no difference<br/>here, so there didn&apos;t particularly seem to be any point in<br/>doing a test with several sizes of page, but after trying it as<br/>20 entries per page, kept that, as I liked the small pages.</p><p>It also happened just as easily with the message text pages,<br/>which have no tables in them, and are pretty basic html,<br/>and there doesn&apos;t seem to be anything wrong with the html<br/>according to the validator I used, and looks okay.</p><p>Those pages just consist of the usual header and html body<br/>text, hrefs, and html character entities, and new paragraph<br/>marks, and line breaks - absolutely straightforward stuff.<br/>Tags used:<br/>&lt;HTML&gt;&lt;HEAD&gt;&lt;BODY&gt;&lt;FONT &lt;P&gt; &lt;PRE&gt; &lt;HR&gt; &lt;STRONG&gt; and character entities<br/>such as &gt;<br/>Also only fields used are &lt;A href=&quot;&quot;&gt;, &lt;A name=&quot;&quot;&gt; and<br/>&lt;FONT color=&quot;&quot; size=&quot;&quot;&gt;</p><p>Also all the open tags are matched by closed tags in the proper<br/>sequence, as checked in the HTML validator.</p><p>However, could only do it by rapidly clicking on the next button,<br/>and I really do mean very rapidly - it was perfectly possible<br/>to browse the archive by just clicking a little more slowly.</p><p>So, if you find that it always crashes on some particular page,<br/>then it might suggest a problem with the html. A<br/>good html browser should fail gracefully rather than crash - just<br/>show an error message or a blank page if it can&apos;t render the<br/>html for whatever reason. But if there is some particular html<br/>syntax that causes Netscape to crash, I could do something about it.</p><p>So let me know if you do find any consistency in the pages it<br/>crashes on.</p><p>Also would be interesting to know if you find it crashes while browsing<br/>the Yahoo Tuning list on-line as I pretty much used the same format for<br/>the html for the tables as for that, and the Yahoo html pages are<br/>much more complex. If it crashes for the new archive _on-line_, and not for the<br/>Yahoo pages, then that would suggest that one can do something about it,<br/>and I&apos;ll give it more thought, and we could see if we can puzzle it out.</p><p>For example, I could do a test &quot;archive&quot; with just the navigation and<br/>no content, say, and see if it still does it. If it did, could then<br/>make a series of web pages using various elements of the<br/>navigation and see if any of those crash it.</p><p>Can&apos;t think of anything else to do at present.</p><p>It is an easy matter to change the number of entries per page for the<br/>tables for future archives, if anyone has any preferences for that.</p><p>Maybe Netscape would do better if they put more effort into making<br/>sure that the browser never crashes as their top priority, and less<br/>into the extra features!</p><p>Of course, has to be very complex program to support java, javascript,<br/>dynamic html, ..., ... The causes of crashes can be very hard to locate<br/>sometimes too.</p><p>I&apos;m happy using IE or Netscape, but it is good to have alternatives to<br/>try, and I too am sorry that Netscape isn&apos;t making quite such a good<br/>go at it as it could.</p><p>Robert</p></div><h3><a id=21666 href="#21666">ðŸ”—</a>jpehrson@rcn.com</h3><span>4/26/2001 7:51:24 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In tuning@y..., &quot;Robert Walker&quot; &lt;robert_walker@r...&gt; wrote:</p><p><a href="/tuning/topicId_21573.html#21633">/tuning/topicId_21573.html#21633</a></p><p>&gt; Hi Joseph,<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I&apos;d like to make the archive work in Netscape as well if I can!</p><p>Hello Robert!</p><p>I hate to say it, but at the moment I am no longer using Netscape.<br/>I&apos;m ONLY using Internet Explorer.  It&apos;s been one thing and<br/>another...mostly the VERY poor quality of Netscape 6, which really<br/>feels like a &quot;cheap&quot; product.  Jon Szanto was explaining that they<br/>had changed their development team, etc., etc.  It looks like they<br/>were trying to &quot;ape&quot; Internet Explorer in the latest version with<br/>certain features.</p><p>Well, I couldn&apos;t even get it to run Quicktime VIDEO and that was the<br/>last straw.  There were several other problems with Netscape,<br/>including the fact that the text never lined up right when I posted<br/>messages.</p><p>It&apos;s a shame, but because Microsoft took over the market, it has<br/>caused Netscape to reorganize and push out a poor and unstable<br/>product.  So things get even WORSE for Netscape and it&apos;s sad in a<br/>way, since I remember back when it was Mosaic and the FIRST original<br/>browser!  (It&apos;s really only be 5 or 6 years ago, unbelieveably)</p><p>So, in the same way that I had to migrate from Wordperfect and Lotus<br/>in &quot;day to day&quot; stuff to Microsoft Office, now THIS.  There is really<br/>no other alternative, since the quality is definitely higher...  It&apos;s<br/>just too bad Microsoft has the ATTITUDE it does.</p><p>So what does this have to do with TUNING??  LOTS, since I use the<br/>browser all the time both on the Tuning List and to reference all the<br/>links we are finding all the time...</p><p>&gt;<br/>&gt; It also happened just as easily with the message text pages,<br/>&gt; which have no tables in them, and are pretty basic html,<br/>&gt; and there doesn&apos;t seem to be anything wrong with the html<br/>&gt; according to the validator I used, and looks okay.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Those pages just consist of the usual header and html body<br/>&gt; text, hrefs, and html character entities, and new paragraph<br/>&gt; marks, and line breaks - absolutely straightforward stuff.<br/>&gt; Tags used:<br/>&gt; &lt;HTML&gt;&lt;HEAD&gt;&lt;BODY&gt;&lt;FONT &lt;P&gt; &lt;PRE&gt; &lt;HR&gt; &lt;STRONG&gt; and character<br/>entities<br/>&gt; such as &gt;<br/>&gt; Also only fields used are &lt;A href=&quot;&quot;&gt;, &lt;A name=&quot;&quot;&gt; and<br/>&gt; &lt;FONT color=&quot;&quot; size=&quot;&quot;&gt;<br/>&gt;</p><p>Well, this is certainly pretty &quot;standard&quot; stuff, Robert.  That<br/>doesn&apos;t give Netscape 4.7 a very good &quot;excuse...&quot;<br/>&gt;</p><p>&gt; Maybe Netscape would do better if they put more effort into making<br/>&gt; sure that the browser never crashes as their top priority, and less<br/>&gt; into the extra features!<br/>&gt;</p><p>The &quot;extra features&quot; in Netscape 6 are quite hidden.  I don&apos;t even<br/>know what they are, but it loads in a lot of Java and other stuff.<br/>That&apos;s another thing, with the memory I have it takes probably more<br/>than a full minute to load in... and then when it IS loaded, doesn&apos;t<br/>do much, or does LESS than Internet Explorer!</p><p>&gt; I&apos;m happy using IE or Netscape, but it is good to have alternatives<br/>to try, and I too am sorry that Netscape isn&apos;t making quite such a<br/>good go at it as it could.<br/>&gt;</p><p>Even with all the pending litigation, it is clear to me that<br/>Microsoft has &quot;won&quot; the war...  It can be seen in the way the new<br/>products are coming out...</p><p>Alas...</p><p>_______ _____ ___ ______<br/>Joseph Pehrson</p></div>
