In Ralph Denyer&apos;s &quot;The Guitar Handbook&quot; he says that the octave (2/1) somehow sounds &apos;similar&apos; to the tonic (1/1). Based on this idea I have found that listening for &apos;similarity&apos; works best and easily. For example take 1/1 paired with 11/6 and 1/1 paired with 9/7. It seems to me that the 11/6 sounds more &apos;similar&apos; to 1/1 than the 9/7.</p><p>What is your opinion after listening?</p><p>BTW, prime limits are not a factor in my interval calculator program but I do not *ignore* them.

For anyone who is interested here&apos;s a story.

Next I listened for &apos;sweetness&apos; and I still couldn&apos;t be sure. Next I listened for &apos;resolution&apos; and I was still flummoxed. Then I remembered reading in Ralph Denyer&apos;s &quot;The Guitar Handbook&quot; that the octave (2/1) sounds *similar* to the tonic (1/1), they could almost be treated as being the same note.

Anyone want to give these a listen?</p><p>I think that the question above (does &apos;similarity&apos; imply sweetness?) is important because when listening for *similarity*, listening tests seem to be much easier and clearer (for me at least) than listening for strength, sweetness or resolution.</p><p>John.</p><p>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; --- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;genewardsmith&quot; &lt;genewardsmith@&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; --- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, Michael &lt;djtrancendance@&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&quot;It could be because of the proximity of 11/8 to 4/3, which is a very strong interval.&quot;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &nbsp;&nbsp; Funny, because, to me the difference between 11/8 and 4/3 is like night and day<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; This is obvious, as otherwise I would have rated it better than 13/7.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; ...and seems to point out one of the huge weaknesses of HE and also Tenney Height (IE they fall to pieces at 11-limit or higher).<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; No more than O&apos;Sullivan&apos;s measure does.
