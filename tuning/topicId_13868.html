This I decided to fully admit early on in my<br/>microtonal explorations, and to work and compose from this point of view<br/>un-ashamedly,  seeing if I couldn&apos;t make some good music from it.<br/>--Also, from the perspective of a &quot;closet&quot; serialist guy (we&apos;re not<br/>generally respected in the open these days).</p><p>In case any one&apos;s interested, here&apos;s the 19-tone &quot;row&quot; I&apos;m working with<br/>these days, which is highly saturated with &quot;013(12tet)&quot; variants:</p><p>6 1 4 3 8 5 18 2 16 0 14 17 13 9 12 7 10 15 11</p><p>Saturation:</p><p>6 1 4   (025)<br/>1 4 3  (013)<br/>4 3 8  (014)<br/>3 8 5  (025)<br/>18 2 16  (025)<br/>2 16 0   (025)<br/>16 0 14  (025)<br/>0 14 17  (025)<br/>14 17 13  (014)<br/>13 9 12   (014)<br/>9 12 7   (025)<br/>12 7 10  (025)<br/>10 15 11  (015)</p><p>note that the % of saturation of the different variants of 013(12tet) is<br/>weighted towards 025(19tet),  the most &quot;familiar&quot; and/or &quot;consonant&quot; of<br/>the variants.</p><p>This &quot;row&quot; can then in turn be placed into an &quot;array&quot; a la Milton<br/>Babbitt&apos;s constructs----these &quot;arrays&quot; are formed of &quot;lynes&quot; which are<br/>based on transformations (R, I, RI, T) of the row, and columns which are<br/>made up of &quot;aggregates&quot;--that is, each column contains all of the 19<br/>pitch-classes of 19t-ET once each exactly.</p><p>Here is one such &quot;array&quot; that I&apos;m thinking of utilizing, using that<br/>&quot;013(12)-variant-saturated&quot; 19-tone row:</p><p><a href="http://music.columbia.edu/~chris/base.array.html">http://music.columbia.edu/~chris/base.array.html</a></p><p>Anyway, I&apos;ll leave this report at that for now. . . . might as well see if<br/>anyone else is interested in this @#$%@#$ before I spend more energy<br/>typing.</p><p>g&apos;day,</p><p>Christopher Bailey</p><p>***From:  Christopher Bailey******************</p><p><a href="http://music.columbia.edu/~chris">http://music.columbia.edu/~chris</a></p><p>**********************************************</p></div><h3><a id=13889 href="#13889">ðŸ”—</a>Joseph Pehrson &#x3C;josephpehrson@compuserve.com&#x3E;</h3><span>10/1/2000 11:30:30 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@egroups.com">tuning@egroups.com</a>, Christopher  Bailey &lt;cb202@c...&gt; wrote:</p><p><a href="http://www.egroups.com/message/tuning/13868">http://www.egroups.com/message/tuning/13868</a></p><p>&gt;<br/>&gt; I am experimenting myself these days in set-theory applied to<br/>various ETs, lately 19tET.

I<br/>haven&apos;t seen most of these anywhere else - sorry if they&apos;re well-known to<br/>you.</p><p>First, a table showing how many set-classes there are of each cardinality<br/>in 19tET, with the figures for 12tET included for the sake of<br/>comparison:</p><p>card.   12tET  Z        19tET  Z</p><p>3         12    0          30     0<br/>4         29    1         120     0<br/>5         38    3         324     0<br/>6         50   15         756    21<br/>7                        1368    57<br/>8                        2052    90<br/>9                        2494   156</p><p>( The &apos;Z&apos; column tells you how many Z-related pairs there are of each -<br/>for example, of the 29 12tET tetrachords, only one pair, [0137] and<br/>[0146], have an identical interval vector. There are no Z-related<br/>triples either in 12tET or 19tET - there are some in 16tET iirc<br/>though)</p><p>When I worked this out I remember finding the sheer number of available<br/>set-classes overwhelming in the 19tET universe - just the number of<br/>tetrachords alone is daunting. Mandelbaum gives a couple of numbers like<br/>these, but as I remember it he doesn&apos;t define his chord-types like<br/>set-classes, so they&apos;re different from mine.</p><p>I also worked out the deep scales, which are the 9- or 10-note sets that<br/>have every interval a different number of times, like the 7-out-of-12<br/>diatonic. There are 9 of them, and I&apos;ve since found them listed in an<br/>article by Carlton Gamer, in the journal of music theory in the 60s.<br/>They&apos;ve probably been mentioned on this list before too, but here goes:</p><p>0 2 4 6 8 10 12 14 16<br/>0 2 4 5 7 9 12 14 16<br/>0 2 3 5 8 10 11 13 16<br/>0 1 3 4 6 7 10 13 16<br/>0 1 4 5 8 9 12 13 16<br/>0 1 4 5 6 9 10 14 15<br/>0 1 2 6 7 8 12 13 14<br/>0 1 2 3 4 10 11 12 13<br/>0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8</p><p>(these are all in prime-form, any of their rotations or inversions is also<br/>good of course)</p><p>Since 19 is prime, you get whole families of chords inter-related by<br/>multiplicative transforms (unlike in 12tET where only M5 can produce a<br/>different set-class). The deep scales above are one such family. Here&apos;s<br/>another example:</p><p>0 2 3 7 -- 0 2 3 8 -- 0 3 4 9 -- 0 2 6 9 -- 0 1 7 9 -- 0 2 7 10 --<br/>0 1 4 11 -- 0 4 5 11 -- 0 2 6 11</p><p>Any of these, under any multiplicative transform mod 19, will give another<br/>member of the set (once you put it into prime-form).  The 120 tetrachords<br/>divide into 13 such families of 9 chords, plus one family of 3 chords:</p><p>0 1 3 8 -- 0 3 5 9 -- 0 1 7 11</p><p>The M-transforms, as they&apos;re called, are fairly bogus musically, if you<br/>ask me.</p><p>Kind of the &quot;opposite&quot; of the deep scales is the one set (and its<br/>complement) in the whole 19-tone universe that has _equal_ numbers of each<br/>interval. The set is:</p><p>0 1 4 7 8 9 10 12 14</p><p>and it has the interval vector &lt;444444444&gt;.</p><p>Aren&apos;t you pleased you asked?</p></div><h3><a id=14210 href="#14210">ðŸ”—</a>Joseph Pehrson &#x3C;josephpehrson@compuserve.com&#x3E;</h3><span>10/9/2000 8:42:12 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@egroups.com">tuning@egroups.com</a>, jon wild &lt;wild@f...&gt; wrote:</p><p><a href="http://www.egroups.com/message/tuning/14154">http://www.egroups.com/message/tuning/14154</a></p><p>Sarn...
