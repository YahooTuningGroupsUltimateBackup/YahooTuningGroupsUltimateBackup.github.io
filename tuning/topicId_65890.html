However, my friend Mary Stribling, who played bluegress for a long while before she played jazz, has, perhaps, the best pitch of anybody I&apos;ve ever played with...she&apos;s dead on, and her timing is impeccable as well. Not sure why, but even though some of the players I&apos;ve uesd may have more facile jazz chops than her, I&apos;d rather use Mary cause I really like having the pitch so accurate...it frees me up to concentrate on just the music....HHH<br/><a href="http://microstick.net">microstick.net</a>  PS...and because she&apos;s a great bluegrass player, her Brazilian playing is great, too, cause both hit the root and 5th on 1 and 3...</p></div>
