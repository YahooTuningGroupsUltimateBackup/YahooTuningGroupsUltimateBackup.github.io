You can already do this sort of thing with<br/>&gt; Finale and Sibelius. When you put a symbol on the staff, the index<br/>of<br/>&gt; the symbol in the symbol-table is what is actually stored. Then you<br/>&gt; can edit the symbol-table so that a different symbol appears at that<br/>&gt; numbered position and all occurrences in your score will<br/>automatically<br/>&gt; show the new symbol. But of course these programs aren&apos;t shareware.<br/>&gt; They do however have free downloadable demo versions that can&apos;t save<br/>&gt; or print.</p><p>***Actually, as a point of clarification, I am under the<br/>understanding that *Finale* has this feature, but Sibelius not yet.<br/>I wish it did!</p><p>J. Pehrson</p><p>  J Pehrson</p><p>   I hope this is sort of directed to me. Perhaps it&apos;s not. At any rate... the numbers would<br/>   HAVE to be microprinted on the paper itself. Why? If someone has a page of paper<br/>   sheet music and needs to scan it into a computer the number has to be visible.</p><p>  Stephen Szpak</p><p>_________________________________________________________________<br/>Tired of slow downloads?
