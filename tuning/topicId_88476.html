It hasn&apos;t been *fully* tested but the anomalies that turned up before have disappeared.</p><p>Why do we need a calculator? Consider the 15/8 interval. Is it good or bad? I imagine if everyone on this list was asked some would say good and some would say bad. I couldn&apos;t be sure, hence I wrote the calculator.</p><p>With this latest version the algorithm I used was pretty much the same. I made a few programming errors in the last version. Gene asked for a formula. Here it is...</p><p>1/x + 1/y - diss    (x should be less than or equal to y)<br/>If x/y&lt;=0.9375 then &apos;diss&apos; = x/y<br/>If X/y&gt; 0.9375 then &apos;diss&apos; = (1 - x/y)*15</p><p>I used this formula, pairing the first 1024 of the elements/harmonics of both notes in an interval with each other and &apos;weighting&apos; each calculation according to the strength value of the quieter element in each pair.</p><p>So far I cannot 100% guarantee that the program is accurate but I suspect that my methods are going in the right direction. Test it yourself and let me know what you think of it.</p><p>John.</p></div><h3><a id=88477 href="#88477">ðŸ”—</a>Michael &#x3C;djtrancendance@...&#x3E;</h3><span>4/29/2010 11:39:42 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Actually (John), I&apos;d say 15/8 is actually bad &quot;considering it&apos;s position&quot; of being so far apart from the root tone IE it&apos;s good in general but bad compared to many other notes toward the higher end octave interval...it sounds to me like a bit of a stretched soprano tone with the vocalist straining a bit to &quot;belch&quot; it out.</p><p>    The very nearby 19/10 in fact sounds considerably more relaxed to me despite barely being any further away from the root.

Unless you&apos;re going to write music<br/>exclusively with that church-organ voice for the rest of your life...&quot;<br/>Exactly.  The key to testing, IMVHO, is to find a few instruments that cover most of the typical harmonic structures you want to use.  For example<br/>1) Clarinet (fairly low stronger odd harmonics like many wind instruments)<br/>2) Guitar (fairly low stronger even harmonics like many stringed instruments)<br/>3) Trumpet (higher even and odd harmonics like many brass instruments)<br/>4) Sine wave (Setharesian &quot;spectral aligned&quot; instruments...if you want to focus on strictly electronic music and particularly music made with the his TransFormSynth softsynth)</p><p>    And here (again) isa graph of the overtone curves of those three: <a href="http://www.stanford.edu/~hoffert/projects/music/figure3.jpg">http://www.stanford.edu/~hoffert/projects/music/figure3.jpg</a><br/>   In addition you may want to try<br/>5) Xylophone and/or Bell (many in-harmonic partials)</p><p>    I have found the sine wave gives you a decent idea of how well a scale will match timbres &quot;on the average&quot;.  So it might be a good idea to make sure your intervals sound quite good with sine waves before bothering to test them with other instruments as, in general, consonance can only go down with non-sine timbres.  Again I don&apos;t recommend saw waves as the abundance of high harmonics is very untypical of most instruments...I&apos;d consider brass a such much realistic option for testing high harmonic timbre &quot;matching&quot; for your scales.</p></div><h3><a id=88493 href="#88493">ðŸ”—</a>jonszanto &#x3C;jszanto@...&#x3E;</h3><span>4/29/2010 4:31:35 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;cityoftheasleep&quot; &lt;igliashon@...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Maybe instead of using the &quot;right&quot; voice, you should use voices that you might actually to make music with?
