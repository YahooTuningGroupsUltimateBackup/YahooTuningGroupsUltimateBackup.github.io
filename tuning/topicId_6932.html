Once the<br/>messages are there, anyone can connect to their particular news server<br/>with a news client and read them.</p><p>A mailing list is handled by a _single_ server.  That server keeps a<br/>list of people who are subscribed to the list, to whom messages are<br/>distributed.  Typically only subscribers can post to the list.  The<br/>subscriber sends a message to the list server, which then mails copies<br/>of the message to everyone on the list.</p><p>&gt;                                                                    Is the<br/>&gt; List formally considered a newsgroup??</p><p>No.</p><p>&gt;                                         I remember newsgroups (on which I<br/>&gt; had participated) like rec.music.compose and rec.music.classical.

I guess this could mean that<br/>&gt; people could quote freely from anything &quot;published&quot; on a Newsgroup...</p><p>On the contrary, the point of &quot;published&quot; status--and as far as I know,<br/>most people are considering both list and newsgroup distribution of a<br/>message as publication--is that copyrights then apply.  This is why it<br/>is considered rude (to say the least) to repost someone else&apos;s message<br/>in its entirety to a different list or group without their permission.<br/>Quoting for the purpose of discussion or review, of course, falls under<br/>&quot;fair use&quot;.</p><p>On Tue, 14 Dec 1999, Patrick Pagano wrote:<br/>&gt; i think Newsgroups are full of spamming etc...<br/>&gt; like hey buy our new poopmaster plus<br/>&gt; with discounts only to newsgroup readers</p><p>Spammers used to attack lists too--it was very easy to subscribe to a<br/>list, ask the server for a list of all subscribers, add them to a spam<br/>database, and unsubscribe again.  Now the subscription procedures for<br/>most lists are a little more elaborate, and it&apos;s harder for spammers to<br/>harvest addresses from servers.</p><p>--pH &lt;<a href="mailto:manynote@library.wustl.edu">manynote@library.wustl.edu</a>&gt; <a href="http://library.wustl.edu/~manynote">http://library.wustl.edu/~manynote</a><br/>    O<br/>   /\        &quot;Churchill?
