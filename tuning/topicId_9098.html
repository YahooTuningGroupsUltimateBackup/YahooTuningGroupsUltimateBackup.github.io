First, after playing this style for over 30 years, I&apos;ve come to<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt;believe that the so called &quot;blue third&quot; (or b5 or whatever note we are<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt;referring to) actually does not have one fixed position...the placement<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt;of the note is totally intuitive, and is done according to one&apos;s feeling<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt;at the time. When teaching, I can show my students how to do it, but I<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt;cannot intellectually tell them. It is a fluid situation, and is one of<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt;the things that gives blues it&apos;s charm and mystery...it&apos;s very difficult<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt;to learn to negotiate those bends in a truly convincing way.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;Dr. Can Akkoc added:<br/>&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt; This is precisely the phenomenon that prompted me into research on the<br/>&gt;&gt; sound structures of Turkish music. My gut feeling is &apos;the placement of the<br/>&gt;&gt; note&apos; at any step is a non-deterministic function of the progression of<br/>&gt;&gt; pitches that precede the said &apos;note&apos;. That is, the melody line has a &apos;fuzzy<br/>&gt;&gt; memory&apos; that calls for variations in the actual pitches used, requiring a<br/>&gt;&gt; fluid underlying scale as a whole. When put in these terms, I am inclined<br/>&gt;&gt; to think there must be a mathematical pattern, waiting to be captured, that<br/>&gt;&gt; will accomodate such fuzzy scales together with the memory mechanism<br/>&gt;&gt; driving the deviations from a set of &apos;anchor&apos; sounds. Such a mathematic<br/>&gt;&gt; should accomodate the performer&apos;s &apos;feeling at the time&apos; by determining the<br/>&gt;&gt; proper pitch bends at every instant as the musical journey evolves in the<br/>&gt;&gt; spiritual universe of the musician.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;Your post is very timely for me, Dr. Akkoc. I had said, in a recent book,<br/>&gt;that it seemed logical to me that the expressive tuning of Middle Eastern<br/>&gt;and Indian styles were, to a large extent, deviations from a norm. Since<br/>&gt;these styles seem to have roots in basic acoustic simple ratios (the 2:3<br/>&gt;&quot;fifth&quot; seems rather universal--except for Balinese type artificial<br/>&gt;divisions of the octave), it seems appropriate to assume that simple<br/>&gt;acoustical intervals were likely the _original &quot;norms.&quot; Through the<br/>&gt;centuries, the stylistic deviations themselves have likely become second<br/>&gt;degree &quot;norms&quot; which provide the bases for further expressive deviation.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;Does this in any way relate to your idea of &quot;fuzzy memory&quot;?</p><p>***************************************************************************</p><p>Dr Eskelin, thank you for your kind note and question. First of all, I like<br/>the term you have used, &quot;expressive tuning&quot; for describing the &apos;dergah&apos;<br/>tradition in Turkish music. I have not come across this terminology before.</p><p>What you are suggesting in your comment could certainly be one way of<br/>explaining the evolution in tuning that might have taken place over the<br/>course of roughly two milleniums. Your idea of &apos;multi-layered norms&apos; does<br/>make a lot of sense to me. The term &apos;fuzzy memory&apos; is based on and is<br/>certainly an intrinsic part of the said evolution.</p><p>I was thinking more of the progression of sounds, the so called &apos;seyir&apos;<br/>issue, when I used the term fuzzy memory. During the course of a taksim,<br/>master musicians seem to be drawing pitches from a set of sound clusters<br/>making up the underlying &apos;scale&apos; for the maqam on hand. The pattern as to<br/>which particular pitch is going to be drawn from a given cluster at any<br/>given time seems quite fuzzy to a layperson like myself. Since different<br/>pitches are selected from these clusters for different &apos;visits&apos; during the<br/>course of the musical journey, the actual intervals are constantly changing<br/>in time. This dynamic scale pattern could be linked to your term<br/>&quot;expressive tuning&quot;.</p><p>My problem is to find quantitative characterizations for such tuning norms<br/>and the governing memory mechanisms that drive the seyir in different<br/>maqams. Despite the &apos;chaotic&apos; picture I might have drawn above, I strongly<br/>believe, there are invariants, however fuzzy they might be, that keep<br/>things from getting out of control while moving the spiritual ecstacy to<br/>new heights and dimensions. I hope I have not cluttered the issue beyond<br/>repair!</p><p>***************************************************************************</p><p>&gt;Needless to say, my reason for being here on the List also began with the<br/>&gt;notion that &quot;there must be a mathematical pattern, waiting to be captured,<br/>&gt;that will accommodate&quot; the phenomenon I have called the &quot;high third.&quot; At<br/>&gt;this point, I&apos;m not nearly so confident that such an explanation is there<br/>&gt;&quot;waiting to be captured.&quot;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;There are so many variables at work here--not the least of which are<br/>&gt;personal taste, poor intonation, wild imagination, and who know&apos;s what<br/>&gt;else--that I suspect that art will win out over science in both of these<br/>&gt;regards. (However, check with me in the morning after I&apos;ve had a good<br/>&gt;night&apos;s sleep.)<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;Dr. Gerald R. Eskelin<br/>***************************************************************************</p><p>I would say don&apos;t give up. If there is a pattern, there must be a<br/>mathematic that can model it. Have you looked at &apos;symbolic dynamics&apos;? This<br/>mathematic is currently being used quite heavily in speech recognition<br/>along with &apos;hidden Markov models&apos;.</p><p>Best regards,</p><p>.<br/>Dr. Can Akkoc<br/>Alabama School of Mathematics and Science<br/>1255 Dauphin Street<br/>Mobile, AL 36604<br/>USA</p><p>Phone:  (334) 441-2126<br/>  Fax:  (334) 441-3297</p></div>
