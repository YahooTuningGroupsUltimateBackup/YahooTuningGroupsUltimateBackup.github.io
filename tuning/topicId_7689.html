In the second volume of Matheson&apos;s &quot;Critica Musica,&quot; which appeared<br/>in 1752, he mentions Neidhard and Werckmeister as the inventors of this<br/>temperament.  Sebastian Bach had already used it for the clavichord<br/>(clavier), as we must conclude from Marpurg&apos;s report of Kirnberger&apos;s<br/>assertion, that when he was a pupil of the elder Bach he had been made to<br/>tune all the major Thirds too sharp.&quot; (p. 321)</p><p>What amazes me is that this hearsay of Kirnberger is his only mention in &quot;On<br/>the Sensations of Tone.&quot;  Berliner Helmoltz missed completely Kirnberger&apos;s<br/>eloquent exposition of non-equal well-temperament.

The transient dose of<br/>spectra delivered by a harpsichord&apos;s wire is a much more difficult image to<br/>quantify.<br/>    Also, the ease of altering the temperament&apos;s wolves (which, according to<br/>Margo, some composers required) let keyboard instruments possess flexibility<br/>through a range of options. This freedom would not be associated with an<br/>organ, whose tunings could be church/political affairs and not done on a per<br/>performance basis.<br/>     Jorgensen makes a case that organ temperament departed from a parallel<br/>course with strung keyboards in the early 1700&apos;s by remaining on a MT track,<br/>then joining up when everybody went to ET in the late 1800&apos;s.

Matheson calling W. the inventor of ET?</p><p>     It is easy for me to imagine that what was &quot; ET&quot;  in 1700 would not be<br/>acceptable today as an ET.  That perhaps it was only equal in relation to<br/>what came before (meantones with wolves over 25 cents).  After 2 centuries of<br/>meantone, a few hot thirds was a small price to pay for &quot;equality&quot;.<br/>     By Werckmiester&apos;s time,  getting everything in the circle with no third<br/>over 21 cents could have been seen as a temperament that was &quot;equal&quot;.  The<br/>suggestion that  favoritism was shown to the more commonly used keys didn&apos;t<br/>change the fact that it was equal,  the absence of wolves proved it equal!.<br/>    I have customers that don&apos;t recognize the inequality of a late 1800&apos;s<br/>temperament (a smooth ascension in tempering from C-E@ 7 cents to F#-A# <a href="https://twitter.com/18">@18</a><br/>cents).  They do recognize and prefer the different &quot;texture&quot; but don&apos;t do so<br/>well trying to pin down where the differences lie.  They could very easily be<br/>convinced that the tuning was equal temperament, since they can &quot; play in all<br/>the keys.........&quot;.<br/>Regards,<br/>Ed Foote<br/>Precision Piano Works<br/>Nashville, Tn.</p></div><h3><a id=7712 href="#7712">ðŸ”—</a>Paul H.
