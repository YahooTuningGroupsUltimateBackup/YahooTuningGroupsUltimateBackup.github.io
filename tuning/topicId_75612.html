These seem to be just repitched versions of the<br/>same sample. The funny thing is that they are clearly not in equal<br/>temperament - or indeed any regular temperament or known tuning.</p><p>Let&apos;s say they are a major scale G-g plus a and b. Then A-a and B-b<br/>are definitely not pure octaves. G-B sounds fairly pure, as does C-a.<br/>There are one or two pure fifths/fourths, but most are fairly far out.<br/>I wonder who on earth thought up such a scale to use in such a context...</p><p>The effect is actually very *non*-synthesized, which may be a strong<br/>contrast with the mechanically composed things that the site actually<br/>produces. (Haven&apos;t listened to them due to browser issues.)<br/>~~~T~~~</p></div>
