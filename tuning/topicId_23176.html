As you note, these<br/>thirds are only about 2 cents from 5-based ratios of 5:4 and 6:5,<br/>differing by a 3-5 schisma of 32805:32768 (~1.95 cents).</p><p>Additionally, between the two manuals we find some major thirds<br/>a _septimal_ comma smaller than usual Pythagorean, e.g. C-E@, at<br/>5103:4096 (~380.56 cents). These thirds are smaller than 5:4 by what<br/>might be termed the 5-7 schisma of 5120:5103 (~5.75 cents), also the<br/>difference between a Pythagorean diminished fifth at 729:512 and a<br/>7:5.</p><p>From a usual neo-Gothic perspective these &quot;5-flavor&quot; thirds are<br/>somewhat specialized intervals in comparison to the usual ratios in<br/>this tuning of 3-prime and 7-prime, but one very characteristic use<br/>would be a cadence like the following. I&apos;ve spelled notes on the upper<br/>manual in both the conventional and &quot;Sesquisexta-style&quot; manners, to<br/>show what the actual keyboard motions are like:</p><p>   G4     A4   Bb4            G#&amp;4/B@4  C#4  B&amp;4/D@4<br/>C#&amp;4/E@4  E4   F4             F&amp;4/Ab@4  G#4  F#&amp;4/A@4<br/>   C4          Bb3     or     C#&amp;4/E@4       B&amp;3/D@4</p><p>In the first example, the schisma major third -- between C4 on the<br/>lower keyboard and the note _visually_ an apotome or chromatic<br/>semitone higher on the upper keyboard (C#&amp;4 or E@4)! -- moves to a<br/>usual Pythagorean or &quot;3-flavor&quot; third above the same lowest note,<br/>while the fifth of the first sonority moves to a major sixth, leading<br/>to a regular Pythagorean cadence expanding to a stable trine (2:3:4).<br/>Note the 27-cent septimal comma shift in the middle voice (E@4-E4)<br/>moving from the &quot;5-7 schisma third&quot; to the usual Pythagorean third.</p><p>In the second example, we start with a schisma third sonority on the<br/>upper manual, and move to a 7-flavor version of a cadential sixth<br/>sonority at a pure 7:9:12, with a standard 7-flavor cadence<br/>following. Here we have a very interesting diesis-like shift of<br/>Ab@-G#, equal in size to a septimal comma plus a Pythagorean comma<br/>(531441:52488, ~23.46 cents), or ~50.72 cents.</p><p>Checking in Manuel Op de Coul&apos;s Scala for MS-DOS, I find that this<br/>ratio of 59049:57344 has a name: &quot;Harrison&apos;s comma.&quot; This progression<br/>reminds me of a very similar cadence in 22-tET (or 22-EDO, if you<br/>like) where we move from a &quot;schisma-like&quot; third to a near-9:7 above<br/>the same lowest note while a third voice moves from fifth to major<br/>sixth, leading again to a usual cadential expansion to a trine.</p><p>Either Harrison&apos;s comma or a 22-tET step is close to 36:35 (~48.77<br/>cents), which Scala terms the &quot;septimal diesis,&quot; the difference<br/>between 5:4 and 9:7. In 22-tET, this step also happens to be the usual<br/>neo-Gothic diatonic semitone; in Sesquisexta, the 7-flavor cadential<br/>semitone at 28:27 (~62.96 cents) is slightly larger.</p><p>I&apos;d describe the &quot;5-flavor&quot; thirds and also the neutral thirds found<br/>in this tuning as &quot;supplementary&quot; intervals, adding variety to the<br/>main themes of 3-prime and 7-prime.</p><p>Most appreciatively,</p><p>Margo Schulter<br/><a href="mailto:mschulter@value.net">mschulter@value.net</a></p></div><h3><a id=23383 href="#23383">ðŸ”—</a>jpehrson@rcn.com</h3><span>5/20/2001 7:58:15 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In tuning@y..., mschulter &lt;MSCHULTER@V...&gt; wrote:</p><p><a href="/tuning/topicId_23176.html#23176">/tuning/topicId_23176.html#23176</a><br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; From a usual neo-Gothic perspective these &quot;5-flavor&quot; thirds are<br/>&gt; somewhat specialized intervals in comparison to the usual ratios in<br/>&gt; this tuning of 3-prime and 7-prime, but one very characteristic use<br/>&gt; would be a cadence like the following.
