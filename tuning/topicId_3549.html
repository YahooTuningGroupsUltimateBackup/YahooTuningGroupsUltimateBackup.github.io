I regularly see deviations of up to 20 cents in &apos;in tune&apos;<br/>instruments.............</p><p>To a modern ear, the pythagorean major third still sounds like a 5:4 ratio,<br/>so it can function as a consonance, but it is rather rough. The 8-cent<br/>improvement offered by 12-tET is quite audible and significant.</p><p>My point, however, was that the musical language of Gothic times (yes, it<br/>was polyphonic) had accepted only fifths, fourths, and octaves as stable<br/>consonances. This is quite well documented. The 5:4 ratio is consonant in<br/>the context of the thicker harmonic language of today, but in those days,<br/>thirds, however tuned, functioned as unstable sonorities and had to resolve.</p><p>Professional brass ensembles especially tend toward just rather than<br/>pythagorean thirds, even in keys where the opposite would be easier. Yes, a<br/>20-cent margin of error is normal, but certain styles and instruments<br/>necessitate finer control for professional-level performances.</p></div>
