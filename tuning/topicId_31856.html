At one point I had &quot;prewarped&quot;<br/>the loudness of the partials to account for the Fletcher Munson curves,<br/>and found that this didnt make much difference in the results...<br/>whats really important is not the actual amplitudes of partials,<br/>but the amplitudes of the beating... to take a ridiculously extereme<br/>case, suppose one tone has a partial at 40,000 Hz (inaudible)<br/>and another at 40,100 Hz, also inaudible. However, if the two are<br/>sounded simultaneously, then there is a beating at 100 Hz,<br/>which is audible (this is kind of how a theremin works, btw).<br/>So, the Fletcher-Munson curves (which would say to put the<br/>perceived volume of those partials in both sounds to zero)<br/>doesnt really help...</p><p>_______________________________________</p><p>JG: Paul, evidently referring to applying a (dyadic or tetradic) &quot;discordance&quot; algorithm<br/>which appears to have been generated by Bill Sethares (and referred to in a thread<br/>entitled &quot;Sethares algorithm) in &quot;harmonic_entropy&quot; message #27:</p><p>PE: &quot;... if I use a fixed waveform and simply adjust the volume up<br/>or down (by adding a constant to all the dBs), I get very different curves.<br/>Is that the way it&apos;s supposed to work, Bill?&quot;</p><p>Yes. Again, to take an extreme case, if the volumes were zero,<br/>then the dissonance should be zero (the most consonant sound is silence!),<br/>whereas the dissonance increases for louder sounds - which<br/>strikes me as plausible, though arguable.<br/>Unfortunately, there are few concrete psychoacoustic studies<br/>that pin down the effects of amplitude. In my algorithm from JASA,<br/>for instance, I just used a multiplicative term that<br/>seemed to work OK for midrange values, and that also<br/>has the right limits as volume goes to zero.<br/>This, along with masking effects, are probably the two<br/>most significant simplifications.</p><p>___________________________________</p><p>PE: The problem Sethares and I were finding was that, depending on the<br/>decibel level you assumed (yes, by &quot;amplitude&quot; Sethares really<br/>means &quot;decibel level&quot;), you can get a wildly different dissonance<br/>curve.</p><p>I do use &quot;decibel-level&quot; as an approximation to &quot;perceived loudness&quot;<br/>(and as Ive been chided for before, have often called it &quot;amplitude&quot;).<br/>This could clearly be refined by using a better measure of sones<br/>(perceived loudness).</p><p>_______________________________</p><p>Sethares:<br/>&gt;I think the normal thing to do when comparing different waveforms is<br/>&gt;to equalize the energy in the signal (add up all the dB numbers, then<br/>&gt;divide by the total to normalize to &quot;1&quot;, for instance).<br/>&gt;Then youve got a &quot;fair&quot; comparison between the two sounds.</p><p>PE: hmm . . . but the results will be very different depending on whether you<br/>normalize to &quot;1&quot; or to some other constant...</p><p>There is a scaling issue, and what Ive usually done is, as stated<br/>above, to call the loudest partial as &quot;1&quot; and express all the others<br/>as fractions - so a partial half as loud would be &quot;0.5&quot;, and a quarter<br/>as loud would be &quot;0.25&quot;. When combining partials with different amplitudes,<br/>the beating is attenuated - the model really only captures this<br/>qualitatively.</p><p>_______________________________</p><p>JG: Wishing that this &quot;aural analysis&quot; business was simpler, but accepting the fact that it is (by its inherently complicated nature) *not*,</p><p>Amen to that.
