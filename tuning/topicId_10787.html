Is that really supposed to be smaller??  It sure<br/>sounds<br/>&gt; like it.. But the minor third in just is larger??  Or isn&apos;t this<br/>just??</p><p>The chord you played is actually an approximation of 12:14:18:21, an<br/>interesting chord in its own right (do a search...). The usual &quot;just&quot;<br/>minor seventh chord, though is 10:12:15:18 (and yes, its minor thirds<br/>are wider than 12-tET minor thirds), which can also be found in my<br/>mapping, at any place where the root and fifth are one color, and the<br/>third and seventh are the other color.</p><p>&gt; HOWEVER, the MAJOR 7th chord... Eb-G-Bb-Db seems almost BEATLESS in<br/>the<br/>&gt; 22-12 version, wheras the 12t-ET version has beating.  Is the major<br/>&gt; third SMALLER than in 12t-ET?</p><p>Yes, the major third in 22-tET is very close to the just major third.</p><p>&gt; I guess if it is, it is this just 7th<br/>&gt; that is creating this beatless effect.</p><p>Huh? I would say that the two nearly just major 3rds are far more<br/>important than the major 7th in creating this beatless effect.</p></div><h3><a id=10805 href="#10805">ðŸ”—</a>Paul Erlich &#x3C;PERLICH@ACADIAN-ASSET.COM&#x3E;</h3><span>6/21/2000 1:14:25 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@egroups.com">tuning@egroups.com</a>, Joseph Pehrson &lt;josephpehrson@c...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt; HOWEVER, the MAJOR 7th chord...

You must have<br/>been actually either talking about the major 7th chord Eb-G-Bb-D, or<br/>the dominant 7th chord Eb-G-Bb-Db. I assumed the former in my last<br/>post, but if it was the latter, you were actually following my<br/>original prescription of what to try. Which was it?</p></div>
