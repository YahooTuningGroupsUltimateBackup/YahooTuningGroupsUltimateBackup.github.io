This is<br/>simple and works great. However, what sometimes happens is that we<br/>name temperaments based on a particular combination of commas. At this<br/>point, it&apos;s like we&apos;re naming temperaments by &quot;multicommas,&quot; which are<br/>like the wedge products of commas.</p><p>Once we assign a name to a temperament eliminating some multicomma,<br/>the naming convention for higher-limit extensions of that multicomma -<br/>perhaps considered to be the wedge product of the multicomma and some<br/>other, new comma - is fairly set out in stone. The lowest badness or<br/>otherwise most notable extension ends up getting the same name as the<br/>temperament it&apos;s derived from, and other notable temperaments get<br/>related or offshoot names. Aside from some nitpicking over which is<br/>&quot;the&quot; best extension for a temperament here and there, this is pretty<br/>simple.</p><p>However, we now have a new, increasingly common situation, which is<br/>that we have to name temperaments which eliminate -factors- of some<br/>multicomma, rather than the whole thing. As an example, there&apos;s<br/>7-limit sensi, and 5-limit sensi, and also 2.5/3.9/7-limit sensi,<br/>which I believe we&apos;re now calling &quot;sentry.&quot; There is no common comma<br/>eliminated by these three, but they are all -factors- of a temperament<br/>which eliminates a certain multicomma which is important enough to<br/>have a name, which is the full 7-limit &quot;sensi&quot; temperament.</p><p>We&apos;ve been handling this situation by coming up with a new pseudonym<br/>for every single subgroup variation of some temperament. I believe<br/>that this may not always be desirable for three reasons:</p><p>1) It leads to an enormous amount of &quot;new temperaments&quot; with &quot;new<br/>names&quot; which we deliberately created by looking at subgroups from<br/>well-known ones<br/>2) Sometimes, defining a &quot;new temperament&quot; isn&apos;t even necessary: it<br/>may sometimes be more desirable to work with existing temperaments,<br/>but error-optimize them around a different set of target intervals<br/>than usual<br/>3) Sometimes it leads to schisms in the terminology that people have<br/>been using and the terminology that they&apos;re now suddenly supposed to<br/>use</p><p>For these reasons I suggest we consider setting it in stone that<br/>subgroup &quot;children&quot; of existing temperaments can use the names of<br/>their parents, so that temperament names can &quot;grow down&quot; from when<br/>define temperaments around multicommas as well as &quot;grow up.&quot; This<br/>isn&apos;t going to be algorithmically perfect in 100% of the cases, just<br/>like it&apos;s not always clear which is &quot;the&quot; 13-limit extension of Catler<br/>temperament, but as a general rule it will solve all of the above<br/>problems.</p><p>-Mike</p></div><h3><a id=102019 href="#102019">ðŸ”—</a>genewardsmith &#x3C;genewardsmith@...&#x3E;</h3><span>12/17/2011 9:59:44 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, Mike Battaglia &lt;battaglia01@...&gt; wrote:</p><p>&gt; For these reasons I suggest we consider setting it in stone that<br/>&gt; subgroup &quot;children&quot; of existing temperaments can use the names of<br/>&gt; their parents, so that temperament names can &quot;grow down&quot; from when<br/>&gt; define temperaments around multicommas as well as &quot;grow up.&quot; This<br/>&gt; isn&apos;t going to be algorithmically perfect in 100% of the cases, just<br/>&gt; like it&apos;s not always clear which is &quot;the&quot; 13-limit extension of Catler<br/>&gt; temperament, but as a general rule it will solve all of the above<br/>&gt; problems.</p><p>It seems to me you need to have some way of deciding which temperament something is the child of.

And all of the numerous subgroup versions of porcupine can just be<br/>x.y.z porcupine, instead of one called &quot;porkupine,&quot; and maybe another<br/>called &quot;porkypine,&quot; and another called &quot;pocrupnie,&quot; or what not. And the<br/>superpyth diatonic scale in 17-edo can actually be superpyth - well, the<br/>2.3.7 version of it - rather than &quot;pepperoni,&quot; &quot;supra&quot;, &quot;archy,&quot; etc. And<br/>the 2.9/7.5/3 245/243 temperament can be identified as a subgroup version<br/>of sensi, rather than calling it &quot;sentry&quot; as we are now.</p><p>Now consider: 8-EDO supports this temperament with remarkable accuracy for<br/>only 8 notes. I recommend giving it a whirl on your AXiS. Assuming you<br/>think the 0-450-900 cent chords are halfway decent for writing actual music<br/>in 8-EDO that doesn&apos;t sound dark and diminished, which I strongly do, then<br/>there&apos;s another reason for you: the more we analyze &quot;bad&quot; EDOs under the<br/>illuminating light of subgroups and dyadic chords, the more we stumble on<br/>subgroup variants of existing temperaments, in the process generating<br/>enormous amounts of names for &quot;new&quot; temperaments which are obviously slight<br/>variants of things we already have. The worst offender I can think of is<br/>17-EDO&apos;s &quot;superpyth&quot;, which is identical to the usual superpyth except for<br/>the mapping for 5 which is barely ever used at all anyway. So instead we<br/>call it something else and remind people that it&apos;s not superpyth, but<br/>rather supra/archy/pepperoni etc.</p><p>Of course, there&apos;s no problem with the existing names that we have, or<br/>coming up with new ones. It&apos;s just that we shouldn&apos;t treat them as being<br/>truly separate from the parent temperament they were derived from. For<br/>example, we have wuerschmidt, wurrschmidt, whirrschmidt, and whorrschmidt,<br/>which are all unique extensions of wurrschmidt. But in addition, they&apos;re<br/>still &quot;wurrschmidt&quot; as well.

A good example of this is to look at porcupine over the <a href="http://2.9.7.11">2.9.7.11</a><br/>subgroup, where it suddenly becomes 2-porcupine - and we call that<br/>&quot;Orgone&quot; temperament instead.</p><p>Another question concerns when a child temperament has more than one<br/>parent. For example, is mohaha a child of mohajira, or beatles, or<br/>maqamic, or migration, or what? One answer to that question is that<br/>mohaha is all of those things, since the phrases &quot;<a href="http://2.3.5.11">2.3.5.11</a> mohajira&quot;,<br/>&quot;<a href="http://2.3.5.11">2.3.5.11</a> beatles&quot;, &quot;<a href="http://2.3.5.11">2.3.5.11</a> maqamic&quot;, and &quot;<a href="http://2.3.5.11">2.3.5.11</a> migration&quot; all<br/>give you enough information to uniquely specify mohaha temperament.</p><p>If it&apos;s desired to have a single standardized name in this case, we<br/>might simply decide to name a subgroup temperament the child of the<br/>lowest-badness temperament of its competitors.

In fact I think it *can* be made &quot;algorithmically perfect in 100% of cases&quot;, by which I mean if I specify a subgroup temperament with a name and a subgroup (of the limit it&apos;s already defined on), then either (1) you know exactly what temperament it is, with no ambiguity, or (2) it&apos;s nonsense because the temperament is lower rank or contorted on that subgroup.</p><p>If I say &quot;31-limit sensi&quot;, that&apos;s totally ambiguous because you have no idea how all the higher primes are mapped. There is an unlimited number of different mappings of those extra primes, and any assignment of the name &quot;sensi&quot; to one of them involves an arbitrary choice.</p><p>What we&apos;re suggesting is totally different, because there is no arbitrary choice. If I say &quot;2.5/3.9/7 sensi&quot;, there is an algorithm to tell you exactly what temperament I mean, with no other information than that in the known 7-limit mapping matrix of sensi. I can specify the algorithm in as much detail as you like, but in concept it&apos;s really simple. You just write down the mapping matrix whose columns are the mappings of those generators {2/1, 5/3, 9/7} in sensi. Next you test if that matrix has full rank and is uncontorted. If so, that&apos;s the temperament meant by &quot;2.5/3.9/7 sensi&quot;. If not, then you reject the description as nonsense. For example, &quot;2.5/3 sensi&quot; is nonsense, because it&apos;s contorted. The description &quot;2.7/5 pajara&quot; is nonsense because it&apos;s rank-1 rather than rank-2.</p><p>I think this is a really important issue because without this ability to specify a subgroup temperament *unambiguously*, the whole thing falls apart.</p><p>Gene, you asked how you could tell that mohaha is a subgroup version of mohajira rather than a subgroup version of squares. I have two things to say in response. First of all, it is not necessary that every subgroup temperament have a unique &quot;parent&quot;. The descriptions &quot;2.5/3.9/7 sensor&quot; and &quot;2.5/3.9/7 sensus&quot; refer to the same temperament, and that&apos;s OK. (In practice you&apos;d just say &quot;2.5/3.9/7 sensi&quot;.) The important thing is NOT that every temperament has a unique name, but that every valid description refers to a unique temperament.</p><p>Second of all, although &quot;<a href="http://2.3.5.11">2.3.5.11</a> mohajira&quot; makes sense (and refers to the temperament called &quot;mohaha&quot;), &quot;<a href="http://2.3.5.11">2.3.5.11</a> squares&quot; is nonsense because squares is contorted on that subgroup. So mohaha could be described as either &quot;<a href="http://2.3.5.11">2.3.5.11</a> mohajira&quot; or &quot;<a href="http://2.3.5.11">2.3.5.11</a> maqamic&quot;, but not as &quot;<a href="http://2.3.5.11">2.3.5.11</a> squares&quot; because the latter is contorted nonsense.</p><p>Just to be clear:</p><p>&quot;<a href="http://2.3.5.11">2.3.5.11</a> mohajira&quot; == &quot;<a href="http://2.3.5.11">2.3.5.11</a> maqamic&quot; == &quot;mohaha&quot;</p><p>&quot;<a href="http://2.3.5.11">2.3.5.11</a> squares&quot; is an invalid description that doesn&apos;t refer to a temperament</p><p>&quot;2.5/3.9/7 sensi&quot; == &quot;2.5/3.9/7 sensus&quot; == &quot;sentry&quot;</p><p>&quot;2.3.11 mohajira&quot; == &quot;2.3.11 maqamic&quot; == &quot;2.3.11 hemififths&quot; == &quot;neutraltet&quot;</p><p>Keenan</p></div><h3><a id=102029 href="#102029">ðŸ”—</a>Keenan Pepper &#x3C;keenanpepper@...&#x3E;</h3><span>12/18/2011 7:37:15 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;genewardsmith&quot; &lt;genewardsmith@...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt; &quot;Neutraltet&quot; from neutral tetrad, is not a synonym for mohajira.</p><p>Correct, it is not a synonym for 11-limit mohajira.</p><p>But it is a synonym for &quot;2.3.11 mohajira&quot;.</p><p>&gt; The POTE generator for neutraltet is 350.525, the POTE generator for 11-limit mohajira is 348.477.</p><p>Similarly, the POTE generator for 5-limit meantone is different from the POTE generator of 7-limit meantone.

A temperament<br/>that eliminates an absurdly large comma with a triangular distance of<br/>64 from the origin is now a through-composed 32-bar chord progression<br/>with a chord change every half note. But if you don&apos;t care about the<br/>MOS&apos;s and work directly with pumps and primes and so on, then 5-limit<br/>sensi and 2.9/7.5/3 sensi have almost nothing in common at all.</p><p>On the other hand, if you care about scales and rank order matrices<br/>and melodies, the above means nothing at all to you, because ratios<br/>are nothing more than a way to &quot;intone&quot; the sounds you&apos;re hearing in<br/>as pleasantly a way as possible. If you&apos;re this guy, then at the end<br/>of the day what you care about are scale categories. You might want to<br/>find &quot;different ways to intone&quot; 5L3s and &quot;different temperaments that<br/>support&quot; 4L3s and all that. You couldn&apos;t care less about<br/>diatonic-based music in superpyth temperament. You have no idea what<br/>point the Bach retunings I just did are supposed to prove. So to you,<br/>there&apos;s a very obvious connection between 5-limit sensi and<br/>2.9/7.5/3-limit sensi: they&apos;re the same thing, except for some higher<br/>primes that you probably don&apos;t care about.</p><p>There are merits to both approaches. And when things like MODMOS&apos;s get<br/>involved, they start to come together. But the problem is that they<br/>come from different paradigms. And until we as theorists integrate<br/>them into one overarching paradigm of music, then never the twain<br/>shall meet.* And we&apos;re stuck trying to force-fit names that are built<br/>around lattices into ideas that are built around scales.</p><p>I think that sooner or later we will have such a theory, but until<br/>then, a nice solution is just for us to allow subgroups of<br/>higher-limit temperaments to be named after their parents. And<br/>besides, the people on the first side of the fence caused their own<br/>problems by naming temperaments after multicommas and not after<br/>individual commas in the first place.</p><p>-Mike</p><p>*I explored the difference between the two approaches a bit in this<br/>composition - <a href="http://soundcloud.com/mikebattagliamusic/sets/tonal-study-in-orgone-temperament/">http://soundcloud.com/mikebattagliamusic/sets/tonal-study-in-orgone-temperament/</a></p><p>The tonality is built around 7:9:11 in 11-EDO, and more complex things<br/>in other temperaments, but what my ears really care about is that the<br/>scale be 4L3s as intended and proper. The whole thing falls apart in<br/>15-EDO and 26-EDO, where this is not the case, and I have to keep<br/>remembering that this smaller interval is actually a &quot;fourth&quot; with a<br/>half and two whole steps leading up to it, whereas this larger<br/>interval is a &quot;third&quot; with only two whole steps. The whole thing<br/>starts to break down at that point, with intonation being secondary.</p></div><h3><a id=102056 href="#102056">ðŸ”—</a>genewardsmith &#x3C;genewardsmith@...&#x3E;</h3><span>12/20/2011 9:16:20 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;Carl Lumma&quot; &lt;carl@...&gt; wrote:</p><p>&gt; The longer I&apos;m at this the more I think<br/>&gt; commas are primary.
