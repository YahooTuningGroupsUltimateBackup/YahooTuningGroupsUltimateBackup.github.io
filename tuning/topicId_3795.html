It can be represented as a triangular lattice with<br/>&gt;&gt;another one on top or a square lattice with another one on top.</p><p>&gt;That is, one can represent it by stacking triagular lattices in _three_<br/>&gt;staggered positions, or square lattices in two staggered positions. For<br/>&gt;viewing more than three layers of this lattice at once, an oblique view is<br/>&gt;necessary.</p><p>That is true in the position with the square base, but in the triangular<br/>view that you drew multiple layers can be seen at once.</p><p>$         A---------E---------B<br/>         /|\       /|\       / \<br/>     B--/-|-\--F#-/-|-\--C# /   \<br/>     | /  Eb--------Bb \ | /  *  \<br/>     |/,&apos;   &grave;.\|/,&apos;   &grave;.\|/       \<br/>     F---------C---------G---------D</p><p>&gt;If we regard these as equilateral triangles, then each note is at the center<br/>&gt;of an imaginary sphere, and the spheres are (probably) packed as efficiently<br/>&gt;as possible. However, Ray, I think you and I would both prefer not to regard<br/>&gt;the triangles as equilateral, but as isosceles with, e.g., the 3:1 side<br/>&gt;shorter than the 5:1 side or the 5:3 side.</p><p>Yes, in terms of psychological space the sides are quite unequal as you<br/>say.  Has any consensus been reached on the relative sizes of these?<br/>I stated earlier that p*ln(p) was the relative distance for prime p but<br/>later realised that this ratio refers to something slightly different,<br/>namely how often each prime should be present (inversely).</p><p>Thanks to all the others that mentioned that Kepler&apos;s conjecture has now<br/>been proven.  I haven&apos;t dared look yet because after the extremely<br/>inelegant proofs of Fermat&apos;s last theorem and the four colour problem I<br/>couldn&apos;t bear to see another such.</p><p>-- Ray Tomes -- <a href="http://www.kcbbs.gen.nz/users/rtomes/rt-home.htm">http://www.kcbbs.gen.nz/users/rtomes/rt-home.htm</a> --<br/>   Cycles email list -- <a href="http://www.kcbbs.gen.nz/users/af/cyc.htm">http://www.kcbbs.gen.nz/users/af/cyc.htm</a><br/>Alexandria eGroup list -- <a href="http://www.kcbbs.gen.nz/users/af/alex.htm">http://www.kcbbs.gen.nz/users/af/alex.htm</a><br/>Boundaries of Science <a href="http://www.kcbbs.gen.nz/users/af/scienceb.htm">http://www.kcbbs.gen.nz/users/af/scienceb.htm</a></p></div>
