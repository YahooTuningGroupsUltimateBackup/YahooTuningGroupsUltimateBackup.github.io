You can write him at:</p><p>Brian McLaren<br/>2462 SE Micah Pl<br/>Corvallis, OR  97333-1966</p><p>He makes a point of emphasizing that corresponding is not as<br/>easy as email; I highly recommend it in this case. He could<br/>probably guide you well in selection of equipment for nEnJ music.</p><p>Here&apos;s a scrap of info, mainly stemming from conversations,<br/>listenings, and improv sessions I had with Brian in San Diego<br/>last fall:</p><p><a href="http://www.ixpres.com/interval/dict/njne.htm">http://www.ixpres.com/interval/dict/njne.htm</a></p><p>I thought there was more on my website about it, but I can&apos;t<br/>find it now... hmmm...  Also, I admit to some inconsistencies<br/>about the ordering and abbreviations of the wording:<br/>non-equal non-just non-octave etc.  Any ideas on a consensus?</p><p>I recently wrote Brian and just the other day received<br/>his reply: a typically generous package of 5 CDs of his<br/>own music, and a 22-page missive written personally to me.</p><p>Most of the letter is a familiar long McLaren rant  :)<br/>(those of you who&apos;ve been &apos;attacked&apos; with so much loving<br/>care know what I mean), but it was done from the heart.</p><p>Of course it&apos;s packed with dozens of highly informative<br/>quotes from his vast library of references concerning tuning<br/>and acoustics, directly refuting my most cherished ideas<br/>concerning tuning, and thus about music and the universe<br/>and God in general.  Gives me plenty to think about.</p><p>But at this point my interest in the design of visualizations<br/>of tuning mathematics has become paramount, for the ultimate<br/>purpose of creating a friendlier tool for composing the music<br/>I hear in my head and want to share audibly with others.<br/>My JustMusic software project (in progress) is the strongest<br/>expression of the interest and the need together, and I owe<br/>inspiration for some more recent parts of it to this List.</p><p>Brian&apos;s an amazingly prolific composer (probably because he<br/>strenously avoids wasting his time reading Tuning List postings,<br/>heh heh...), writing series of pieces that systematically go<br/>thru a whole set of ET, JI, or nEnJ tunings using various<br/>contrapuntal systems, with (it appears to me) a strong emphasis<br/>on a linear (i.e., melodic) conception, the various mixing<br/>and clashing of those separate lines being Brian&apos;s way of<br/>giving a sharp-edged definition to the perceptual characteristics<br/>of each individual tuning.  He has his most fun comparing<br/>different members of a family of tunings (a la Easley Blackwood,<br/>Ivor Darreg, but on a far vaster scale... kind of... uh...<br/>Mahlerian...), each one a discrete little gem in the puzzle<br/>which shows the whole picture.</p><p>(PS to zHANg:  Please do me a favor and mail a copy of this<br/>posting, including your original post which I quoted, with<br/>your letter.  Brian doesn&apos;t get this List, and not only would<br/>he appreciate your interest in these scales (since he feels<br/>he&apos;s one of the few and one of the proud), but also, some of<br/>this ended up becoming my initial personal (oops!) response<br/>to him too.</p><p>(PPS to  Brian:  rest assured that, while I admit to being<br/>addicted to this List a couple of different times, each for a<br/>few-month-period, and can understand your sincere concern<br/>over that, they were phases; other developments in my life<br/>have since taken precedence.  Please think over what you wrote<br/>me and now breathe a *huge* sigh of relief.  I suppose, as<br/>with many other subscribers, my interest and the time I devote<br/>to this List wax and wane according to many other shifting<br/>currents.)</p><p>BTW, there are some *veeeeeeeeeeeerrry* interesting tunings<br/>happening in Bob Dylan&apos;s vocals...</p><p>-monz</p><p>Joseph L.
