Unfortunately, the ones<br/>&gt;I worked with got into loops too easilly.</p><p>Are you speaking of Neural Networks like brainwave amplifiers? What guy&apos;s<br/>like Alvin Lucier and David Tudor were using back in the sixties.</p><p>If so...how does one go about finding them? I&apos;m having a hard time trying to<br/>find any information on the net, and believe me I&apos;ve tried.</p><p>I&apos;m interested in them for the purpose of attempting new ways of composing,<br/>since I&apos;m not one to worry about the outcome of such pieces of sound.</p><p>I&apos;d appreciate any kind of help.</p><p>Sincerely,<br/>Jeffrey Collins</p></div>
