It could even convert a spoken voice into melody,<br/>in real time.</p><p>&quot;It&apos;s in the technology. You just have to switch it on,&quot; he said.</p><p>Taito&apos;s Kitamura added that the advent of high-speed communications had<br/>also been essential for the new system.</p><p>Ten years ago, Taito pioneered Japan&apos;s popular &quot;telecom karaoke&quot; services,<br/>which pipe karaoke music and lyrics to pubs and night clubs via wireline<br/>networks at far less cost than maintaining an on-site disc collection.</p><p>Noting the new system would require about a hundred times or more much<br/>bandwidth than current systems, Kitamura added: &quot;We can do this thanks to<br/>ADSL (assymetric digital subscriber lines) and fiber-to-the-home.&quot;</p></div>
