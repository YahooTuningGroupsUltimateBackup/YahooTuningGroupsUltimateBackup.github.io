I have since been<br/>&gt;unable to find the reference materials where I read this.</p><p>One book that I think may be useful to you in researching this is:</p><p>Imaging Sound :<br/>An Ethnomusicological Study of Music, Art, and Culture in Mughal India<br/>(Chicago Studies in Ethnomusicology)<br/>by Bonnie C. Wade<br/>University of Chicago Press<br/>ISBN: 0226868400</p><p>If I remember correctly, there is some info. about the introduction of<br/>tanpura-like stringed drone instruments in this book.  I think they were<br/>originally long-necked gut-fretted lutes (similar to sehtar or saz) that<br/>were used as drones when they were not being used as melody instruments,<br/>which eventually evolved into the modern tanpura.  But check the book,<br/>don&apos;t rely on my memory.  :-)</p><p>If this book turns out to not be what you are looking for, let me know,<br/>I can probably dig up some other references, but this was the first<br/>thing to come to mind.</p><p>Cheers,<br/>Christopher<br/><a href="mailto:christopher.chapman@conexant.com">christopher.chapman@conexant.com</a></p></div><h3>Jacky Ligon &#x3C;jacky_ekstasis@yahoo.com&#x3E;</h3><span>8/29/2000 9:20:06 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Christopher,</p><p>Thanks for this info!
