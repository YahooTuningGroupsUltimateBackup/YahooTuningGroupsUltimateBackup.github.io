First, after playing this style for over 30 years, I&apos;ve come to<br/>believe that the so called &quot;blue third&quot; (or b5 or whatever note we are<br/>referring to) actually does not have one fixed position...the placement<br/>of the note is totally intuitive, and is done according to one&apos;s feeling<br/>at the time. When teaching, I can show my students how to do it, but I<br/>cannot intellectually tell them. It is a fluid situation, and is one of<br/>the things that gives blues it&apos;s charm and mystery...it&apos;s very difficult<br/>to learn to negotiate those bends in a truly convincing way.( Also, no<br/>offense meant, it&apos;s only folks who don&apos;t play the style that use terms<br/>such as &quot;blue third;&quot; I have never heard a practitioner of the blues use<br/>that term...we just do it.) I have the feeling that in Indian and<br/>Turkish music, for example, many notes have an &quot;area&quot; where they exist,<br/>and the 3rd or 2nd or whatever changes according to what is being<br/>expressed. Can Akkoc is doing research on this phenomenon in Turkish<br/>music...maybe he would care to talk a bit about his research to date.<br/>I&apos;m always happy to see blues discussed...it&apos;s one of the great musical<br/>forms...if you want to hear killer string bending, check out &quot;Going Down<br/>Slow&quot; by Howlin Wolf...Hubert Sumlin does some truly astounding playing.<br/>Anything by Albert King is superb as well, and Roy Buchanan was another<br/>monster...check out &quot;Pete&apos;s Blues&quot; from his first album...Hstick  PS of<br/>course, there&apos;s manymany others as well...</p></div><h3><a id=9024 href="#9024">ðŸ”—</a>Can Akkoc &#x3C;akkoc@asms.net&#x3E;</h3><span>3/2/2000 1:41:32 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>At 08:01 AM 3/2/00 -0700, you wrote:<br/>&gt;From: Neil Haverstick &lt;<a href="mailto:STICK@USWEST.NET">STICK@USWEST.NET</a>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;   Blues has been popping up on the list lately, and I have a comment or<br/>&gt;two.

In the few months<br/>I&apos;ve been &quot;hanging around&quot; here, I have a renewed respect for intuitive<br/>and/or &quot;expressive&quot; tuning. What is interesting is that this sort of<br/>&quot;freedom&quot; appears to be used in most musical styles, including traditional<br/>classical music. Your feeling about the flexible &quot;blue third&quot; may in fact be<br/>reflected in classical string player&apos;s tuning of an &quot;urgent&quot; leading tone.</p><p>My experience with the &quot;blue third&quot; as both performer and theorist is that<br/>it does seem to approximate the 6:7 harmonic ratio. Of course, this interval<br/>only appears in the blues scale &quot;naturally&quot; between scales steps 5 and b7<br/>over tonic; however, it seems to me quite obvious that blues players/singers<br/>hear something in the vicinity of this same 6:7 ratio in the tonic to b3<br/>position.</p><p>I find it interesting that you evidently assumed that the reference to &quot;blue<br/>third&quot; has to do with b5. I have toyed with the idea that the b5 seems to<br/>connect expressively to something lower than itself--possibly directly to<br/>the &quot;blue third&quot; on scale step b3 as an _additional_ 6:7 third. It seems<br/>evident (from a stylistic standpoint) that &quot;flat five&quot; does not relate<br/>upward to scalestep 5 (since it almost never goes there). To me, its best<br/>connection to the blues scale, as a whole, is through its relation to b3.</p><p>&gt; When teaching, I can show my students how to do it, but I<br/>&gt; cannot intellectually tell them. It is a fluid situation, and is one of<br/>&gt; the things that gives blues it&apos;s charm and mystery...it&apos;s very difficult<br/>&gt; to learn to negotiate those bends in a truly convincing way.</p><p>It _is_ true, I believe, that _real music cannot be learned from a theory<br/>book--be it classical, Indian, gypsy, blues or any other expressive style.<br/>Nevertheless, there are generalities that can be abstracted that will help a<br/>novice to get started. As maturity grows, the &quot;rules&quot; fade. And, as you<br/>point out, it is possible to bypass generalities altogether by immediate<br/>communication from teacher to student. But you will have to make room for<br/>those of us who search for the generalities that will help those not<br/>fortunate enough to have gifted performing teachers.</p><p>&gt; ( Also, no<br/>&gt; offense meant, it&apos;s only folks who don&apos;t play the style that use terms<br/>&gt; such as &quot;blue third;&quot; I have never heard a practitioner of the blues use<br/>&gt; that term...we just do it.)</p><p>No offense taken, but some of us who use the term _do_ play/sing the style,<br/>and do it very well. You may want to rethink your use of words such as<br/>&quot;only&quot; in regard to those who use the term. Some of us who use the term in a<br/>meaningful way also &quot;just do it.&quot;</p><p>Jerry</p></div><h3><a id=9063 href="#9063">ðŸ”—</a>Gerald Eskelin &#x3C;stg3music@earthlink.net&#x3E;</h3><span>3/3/2000 10:26:39 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>To Neil Haverstick&apos;s post:<br/>&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt;   Blues has been popping up on the list lately, and I have a comment or<br/>&gt;&gt;two.

I had said, in a recent book,<br/>that it seemed logical to me that the expressive tuning of Middle Eastern<br/>and Indian styles were, to a large extent, deviations from a norm. Since<br/>these styles seem to have roots in basic acoustic simple ratios (the 2:3<br/>&quot;fifth&quot; seems rather universal--except for Balinese type artificial<br/>divisions of the octave), it seems appropriate to assume that simple<br/>acoustical intervals were likely the _original &quot;norms.&quot; Through the<br/>centuries, the stylistic deviations themselves have likely become second<br/>degree &quot;norms&quot; which provide the bases for further expressive deviation.</p><p>Does this in any way relate to your idea of &quot;fuzzy memory&quot;?</p><p>Needless to say, my reason for being here on the List also began with the<br/>notion that &quot;there must be a mathematical pattern, waiting to be captured,<br/>that will accommodate&quot; the phenomenon I have called the &quot;high third.&quot; At<br/>this point, I&apos;m not nearly so confident that such an explanation is there<br/>&quot;waiting to be captured.&quot;</p><p>There are so many variables at work here--not the least of which are<br/>personal taste, poor intonation, wild imagination, and who know&apos;s what<br/>else--that I suspect that art will win out over science in both of these<br/>regards. (However, check with me in the morning after I&apos;ve had a good<br/>night&apos;s sleep.)</p><p>Dr. Gerald R.
