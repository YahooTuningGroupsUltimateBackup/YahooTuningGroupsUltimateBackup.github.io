Here I might just mention a few topics, including the extended<br/>Renaissance/Manneristic meantone tunings in which you have expressed<br/>an interest.</p><p>For the Gothic era of around 1200-1420, Pythagorean intonation and its<br/>possible variations could provide one theme. A general Pythagorean<br/>tuning FAQ focusing on this era is available at:</p><p><a href="http://www.medieval.org/emfaq/harmony/pyth.html">http://www.medieval.org/emfaq/harmony/pyth.html</a></p><p>An especially intriguing medieval topic might be the intonational<br/>system of Marchettus of Padua as expounded in his _Lucidarium_ of<br/>1318. Joe Monzo and I have had some discussions about Marchettus on<br/>this List, and Jan Herlinger&apos;s modern edition of the treatise provides<br/>one starting point for lots of uncertain but captivating conjecture.</p><p>Among other things, Marchettus describes and gives examples of direct<br/>chromaticism (e.g. G-G#-A), proposes what might be considered the<br/>first &quot;microtonal&quot; notation for polyphony distinguishing between more<br/>than two sizes of semitones, and describes the use of extra-wide<br/>cadential major thirds and sixths expanding to fifths and octaves<br/>respectively which _might_ represent new interval types roughly<br/>intermediate between usual Pythagorean major thirds and fourths, or<br/>major sixths and minor sevenths.</p><p>Since Marchettus is addressing vocal intonation rather than the tuning<br/>of fixed-pitch instruments, some ambiguity may not be so surprising,<br/>but his apparently accentuated variations on Pythagorean tuning leave<br/>room for lots of experimentation regarding the intonation of music<br/>from his 14th-century milieu, and also for new &quot;neo-Gothic&quot; music<br/>based on a range of extended Pythagorean or &quot;super-Pythagorean&quot;<br/>tunings.</p><p>Turning now to the 16th and early 17th centuries, theorists of special<br/>interest from a viewpoint of 31-note meantone tunings and instruments<br/>include Nicola Vicentino (1555) and Fabio Colonna (1618). For some<br/>background and references, you might try among other sources a series<br/>I did here in October of 1999, and also an excellent article of Bill<br/>Alves originally published in _1/1_:</p><p><a href="/tuning/topicId_5609.html#5609">/tuning/topicId_5609.html#5609</a> (Pt. 1)<br/><a href="/tuning/topicId_5621.html#5621">/tuning/topicId_5621.html#5621</a> (Pt. 2)<br/><a href="/tuning/topicId_5646.html#5646">/tuning/topicId_5646.html#5646</a> (Pt. 3)<br/><a href="/tuning/topicId_5670.html#5670">/tuning/topicId_5670.html#5670</a> (Pt. 4 -- notes)</p><p><a href="http://www2.hmc.edu/~alves/vicentino.html">http://www2.hmc.edu/~alves/vicentino.html</a> (Alves article)</p><p>Theorists of this Renaissance/Manneristic era may not have made any<br/>rigorous distinction between a meantone tuning with pure major thirds<br/>(1/4-comma temperament) and one dividing the whole-tone into five<br/>precisely equal parts (31-tET).</p><p>By 1666, the theorist Lemme Rossi does make this fine distinction,<br/>with Christian Huygens offering a more rigorous mathematical basis in<br/>his famous advocacy of an equal 31-tone division near the end of the<br/>century.</p><p>However, the circulating 31-note tunings of Vicentino and Colonna very<br/>closely approach this model if we assume pure major thirds, and both<br/>Vicentino and Colonna speak at once of a tuning after &quot;common<br/>practice&quot; (i.e. usual meantone of some variety) and of a division of<br/>the tone into five equal dieses.</p><p>Therefore, I might prefer the neutral or open category &quot;31-note<br/>meantone systems,&quot; including either 1/4-comma or 31-tET or the likely<br/>variations tuned in practice on the archicembalo of Vicentino or the<br/>_Sambuca Lincea_ of Colonna.</p><p>These are just a few starting points, and I would be glad to help if I<br/>can either through this list or via e-mail.</p><p>Most appreciatively,</p><p>Margo Schulter<br/><a href="mailto:mschulter@value.net">mschulter@value.net</a></p></div>
