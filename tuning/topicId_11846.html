Well, after this experiment,<br/>it became clear that there is a whole range of well-temperaments, ranging<br/>from 12-tET to tunings where the worst fifth is upwards of 710 cents, that<br/>come out as local minima. Since (I did not mention this yet, so I&apos;m glad you<br/>asked) the total discordance of these scales was greater the farther they<br/>were from 12-tET, it is clear that 12-tET is the only true local minimum<br/>here. I can&apos;t be too upset at my optimizer for not always converging to<br/>12-tET, since 11-dimensional space can be hard to navigate. However, there<br/>may be some significance to the fact that all the well-temperaments<br/>significantly different from 12-tET that the optimizer got stuck at share a<br/>common pattern, beyond the obvious one you mentioned -- anyone see it?</p></div><h3><a id=11945 href="#11945">ðŸ”—</a>Paul H.

Because the biggest dips in the harmonic entropy curve are at<br/>&gt;     3/2, it&apos;s &quot;not a bad approximation&quot; to say that this is all that<br/>&gt;     matters.  You further emphasize this by saying that, between<br/>&gt;     major and minor seconds, the curve is &quot;featureless&quot;.</p><p>&gt;   . But, when I suggest you reduce the strength of minor seconds and<br/>&gt;     eliminate the unison dip to keep the scales from collapsing into<br/>&gt;     others with fewer notes, you say you don&apos;t want to &quot;bias the<br/>&gt;     results.&quot;</p><p>John, I think what you&apos;re missing is, the 12 tones (well, effectively only<br/>11) are free to move aroung wherever they want, and there&apos;s nothing (in<br/>principle) to stop two adjacent tones from ending up, say, a minor third<br/>apart. But if I start out reducing the weight on the intervals between<br/>adjacent tones, because of an assumption that they&apos;re minor seconds and<br/>therefore don&apos;t matter, I&apos;ll be biasing the program against finding a<br/>solution where adjacent tones are a minor third apart.</p><p>&gt;You say you&apos;re looking for &quot;interesting new scales&quot;.  Could you better<br/>&gt;define what makes a scale &quot;interesting&quot; in your view?</p><p>Lots of possible things, but one of them is being a local minimum of<br/>discordance.</p><p>&gt;How do you test for convergence in a particular run of your optimization<br/>&gt;program?  The results you posted have precision to .01 cents in some<br/>&gt;values, but only to integer cents in others - what does this mean?</p><p>I have used parameters of 10^-8 as the convergence tolerance for both the<br/>notes and the discordance value. The accuracy, though, is effectively<br/>limited to 1 cent because I only calculated the harmonic entropy curve in 1<br/>cent intervals, and use linear interpolation to make it a continuous<br/>function. Maybe that explains the &quot;sticky&quot; well-temperaments?</p></div>
