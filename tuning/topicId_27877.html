I haven&apos;t<br/>hit this yet on the sequences I&apos;ve tuned (only a handful, since the<br/>feature came online only yesterday), but I know they&apos;re out there.  The<br/>fix will involve establishing a horizontal range of time during which<br/>the interpretation of a given pitch class must be consistent.</p><p>You realize that when we say &quot;16-tone COFT&quot;, we&apos;re already past the true<br/>COFT calculation, yes?  This kind of splitting can only be done on the<br/>big matrix.  Of course, the 16 tones _could_ be retrofitted to a true<br/>16-tone COFT, though I don&apos;t have code yet to do that.</p><p>&gt;Also, isn&apos;t this a comparison you normally do? Well, OK, slightly<br/>&gt;different, but you do often compare various meantone chains . . .</p><p>I force the sequence into various 12-note meantone chains and evaluate<br/>the vertical pain.  So this is a little more, requiring new code.</p><p>This new trick may not always lead to grounding splits along a<br/>consistent chain of fifths.  If, for example, pitch class 6 (F#/Gb) and<br/>pitch class 3 (D#/Eb) are the only two split, then mapping the result<br/>to a chain of fifths is not possible.  The program could of course<br/>force the intervening pitch classes (1 and 8 in this example) to split<br/>as well.  With &quot;old&quot; works (Mozart and earlier), it&apos;s not surprising<br/>when a particular piece does have splits consistent with a chain of<br/>fifths.  I got 15 consistent pitch classes, Ab thru A#, on the<br/>Bach/Busoni, one of the few others I&apos;ve tried so far.</p><p>&gt;What causes the ambiguity? Augmented triads?</p><p>I&apos;m not sure; to answer that I need to add code that seeks out the worst<br/>deviations and identifies them for analysis.  I suspect that chains of<br/>minor thirds are the most common culprit: when they form a full<br/>diminished tetrad they&apos;re pushed to around 300 cents each (depending<br/>upon relative volume), but when there are only two in a chain, the<br/>tritone is forced very far from 600 cents, as you know.  Augmented<br/>triads are much less common, but they would also cause disruption in<br/>grounding.</p><p>JdL</p></div><h3>Paul Erlich &#x3C;paul@stretch-music.com&#x3E;</h3><span>9/6/2001 2:09:21 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In tuning@y..., &quot;John A. deLaubenfels&quot; &lt;jdl@a...&gt; wrote:</p><p>&gt; You realize that when we say &quot;16-tone COFT&quot;, we&apos;re already past the<br/>true<br/>&gt; COFT calculation, yes?</p><p>No, I didn&apos;t realize this.</p><p>&gt; This kind of splitting can only be done on the<br/>&gt; big matrix.</p><p>Only?</p><p>&gt; Of course, the 16 tones _could_ be retrofitted to a true<br/>&gt; 16-tone COFT, though I don&apos;t have code yet to do that.</p><p>If you did that, would that contradict your &quot;only&quot; assertion above?</p></div><h3>John A. deLaubenfels &#x3C;jdl@adaptune.com&#x3E;</h3><span>9/6/2001 3:06:40 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>[I wrote:]<br/>&gt;&gt;You realize that when we say &quot;16-tone COFT&quot;, we&apos;re already past the<br/>&gt;&gt;true COFT calculation, yes?</p><p>[Paul E:]<br/>&gt;No, I didn&apos;t realize this.</p><p>The tiny COFT matrix can only be formed with knowledge of the number of<br/>pitch classes; it is a distillation across time.</p><p>&gt;&gt;This kind of splitting can only be done on the big matrix.</p><p>&gt;Only?</p><p>Yes, unless the sequence somehow comes in with knowledge of &gt; 12 pitch<br/>classes.
