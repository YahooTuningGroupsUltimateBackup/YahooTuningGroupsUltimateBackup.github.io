It wasn&apos;t until 1934<br/>that Haba was appointed a professor of composition at the<br/>Conservatory. Among his many students, several of whom went on to<br/>produce and promote fractional interval music themselves, were<br/>Ljubica Maric, Jeronimas Kacinskas, Viktor Ullmann, Slavko Osterc,<br/>Constantin Iliev, Jiri Srnka, Necil Kazim Akses, Erwin Schulhoff,<br/>Karel Reiner, Miroslav Ponc, Stepan Lucky, Rudolf Kubin, Jaroslav<br/>Jezek, Vaclav Dobias, Karel Ancerl, and many, many others.</p><p>Haba composed an awful lot of quarter-tone music, including a full<br/>quarter-tone opera, Matka, and six string quartets (nos. 2, 3, 4, 6,<br/>12 and 14), six suites, eleven fantasies and a sonata for piano, and<br/>two suites for guitar. Haba also composed pieces using other<br/>fractional divisions of the tone, like string quartet no. 16 in fifth-<br/>tones, and string quartets (nos. 5, 10 and 11) and suites for solo<br/>violin and cello in sixth-tones.
