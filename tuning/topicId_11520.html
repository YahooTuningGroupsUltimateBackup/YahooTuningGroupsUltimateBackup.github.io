The programme JI Calc gives the ratio 977/942 for 19<br/>&gt;tet, and the ratio 4233/4178 for 53 tet. I would be grateful if anyone<br/>&gt;could tell me how these are derived and how I could work out the ratio<br/>&gt;needed to generate 22 tet.  I would like to make sure that the luthier<br/>&gt;and I agree on figures as the luthiers I know in Edinburgh rarely if<br/>&gt;ever do unconventional jobs. I would be extremely grateful for help on<br/>&gt;this point.</p><p>Alison, it&apos;s probably far better to give a luthier a full set of fret<br/>positions in inches or centimeters, and a complex ratio-approximation for a<br/>single step is next to useless. However, since you asked, 977/942 is an<br/>approximation to 2^(1/19), 4233/4178 is an approximation to 2^(1/53), and an<br/>approximations to 2^(1/22) of similar complexity is 1999/1937.</p><p>If you tell me the scale of your instrument (examples: Stratocaster = 25.5<br/>inches, Les Paul = 24.75 inches), I can give you a full list of fret<br/>positions that your luthier is likely to find infinitely preferable to a<br/>single ratio.</p></div>
