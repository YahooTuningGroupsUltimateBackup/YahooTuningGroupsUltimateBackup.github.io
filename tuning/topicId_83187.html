Obviously 3/2 is special because it divides the space between 1 and 2 evenly (50% on each side).</p><p>For the 5th you can derive the basic scale:<br/>1<br/>1.13541666<br/>1.29<br/>1.5<br/>...and, using the optional &quot;period equivalents&quot; you can obtain the &quot;extended&quot; scale (which nears 9 notes per 2/1 octave):<br/>1<br/>1.06684<br/>1.1354<br/>1.21875<br/>1.291666<br/>1.5</p><p>   Side note: this program uses the number entered as the period/&quot;pseudo-octave&quot;.</p><p>   Hope you all enjoy this...please let me know what you think.</p><p>-Michael</p></div>
