The quintal schisma<br/>is figured in every 9 fifths; the septimal schisma every 23 fifths.</p><p>This is version 1.0, a rough model. This was derived from what I call a<br/>&quot;balanced periodicity block&quot;; thus the schisma every 9 fifths instead of 8. It<br/>was done completely by hand, because I can&apos;t get Scala to do what I want it to<br/>do, and it&apos;s more fun working it out the hard way, at least for me....</p><p>1/1 64/63 36/35 28/27 135/128<br/>16/15 243/224 35/32 10/9 9/8<br/>8/7 81/70 7/6 32/27 6/5<br/>128/105 315/256 5/4 81/64 9/7<br/>35/27 21/16 4/3 27/20 48/35<br/>112/81 45/32 64/45 81/56 35/24<br/>40/27 3/2 32/21 54/35 14/9<br/>128/81 8/5 512/315 105/64 5/3<br/>27/16 12/7 140/81 7/4 16/9<br/>9/5 64/35 448/243 15/8 256/135<br/>27/14 35/18 63/32 (2/1)</p><p>Both commata, syntonic (81/80) and septimal (64/63), are used, and the comma<br/>sharp/flat is treated as an augmented seventh/diminished second. The difference<br/>between the two commas, 5120/5103, is the schisma known as Beta 5 (according to<br/>Scala).I&apos;ll work on a better version.~Danny~</p><p>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p>Chat with friends online, try MSN Messenger: Click Here<br/>[<a href="http://g.msn.com/1HM1ENUS/c144">http://g.msn.com/1HM1ENUS/c144</a>??PS=47575]</p></div>
