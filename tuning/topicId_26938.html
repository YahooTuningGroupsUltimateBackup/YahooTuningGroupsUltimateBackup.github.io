The lines below may interest you.</p><p>As you know, it is not easy, and in fact virtually impossible to<br/>reconstitute the temperament of an organ that has been retuned<br/>from whatever have you, to E.T. This happened at the end of the<br/>18th and within the 19th century to many organs.</p><p>Couldn&apos;t it appear then as madness to claim there exists an exact<br/>mathematical/technological specification of Bach&apos;s &quot;wohltemperirt&quot;<br/>harpsichord temperament???</p><p>The solution to this problem is surprising and simple, provided one<br/>knows something about Bach&apos;s method of composition. It is clear, once<br/>Bach&apos;s system is known, one can establish mathematically the relevant<br/>set of numbers pertaining to that tuning system.<br/>Wouldn&apos;t it seem natural to any composer and in no way far-fetched,<br/>to utilize, to profit from these numbers to structure the music my<br/>means of them? Unifying thereby the harmonies via the numbers of the<br/>temperament with the music&apos;s architecture.<br/>What are such numbers? The octave must remain perfect and the fifth is<br/>the next simple interval - it can be tempered. You know that the old<br/>music theory worked via monochord lenghts. We take the reciprocals,<br/>for the intervals as (N+1=)/N.<br/>Such that N=1 means octave 2/1, N=4 the major third 5/4, etc.</p><p>Temperings, as Werckmeister wrote, also were expressed as such ratios;<br/>see your facsimile.</p><p>For the (N+1)/N of 369, then results 370/369. This, as mathematics show,<br/>is the tempering for Bach&apos;s fifth.<br/>The most simple numbers pertaining to &quot;Werckmeister/Bach/wohltenmperirt&quot;<br/>are therefore are: 7, 5 the fifths, and 369, etc.</p><p>The 4 Duets, before my results impossible to explain, have ***369 *****<br/>bars; their midpoint being musically distinguished - look it up.<br/>That midpoint of the entire structure falls into Duetto II, its bar 112.</p><p>369= 185+1+185</p><p>As Duetto I has 73 bars, we have 73+112=185 for that central bar<br/>of the overall structure.<br/>Gematria converts CHRISTUS, overall central bar into 112 - the &quot;mediator&quot;!</p><p>The Duetto II itself,<br/>149 bars, is structured 37+75+37 bars.<br/>                           7 perfect fifths+<br/>                            5 fifths &quot;&quot;wohltemperirt&quot;.</p><p>The 75 central bars are structured 75=31+13+31 - tri-unitary. In baroque<br/>times the triad was a musico-theological symbol. In particular, by<br/>Werckmeister&apos;s musico-theological speculations.</p><p>The 37 framing bars are structured, again symmetrically, as 37=9+19+9:<br/>Therein, 9 is the trias trinitatis per additionem, 9=3+3+3, and<br/>19 intervals, 12 fifths and 7 octaves in  the reversed sense, close<br/>the circle.</p><p>Werckmeister invented &quot;Bach/wohltemperirt&quot;:<br/>**************************************************</p><p>Let&apos;s look now into the first example for baroque GEMATRIA:</p><p> 11 letters    11 letters   partition according to the UNITAS<br/>MUSICALISCH   ETEMPERATUR<br/>   112          135                          112+135=247<br/>=CHRISTUS       1=UNITAS<br/>                 3=THIRD in thoroughbass<br/>                  5=FIFTH in basso continuo<br/>                !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!<br/>                  This is the specification of the<br/>                  C-major triad &quot;wohltemperirt&quot;<br/>                 in which third and fifth beat at<br/>                      the unison: UNITAS!</p><p> 247<br/>Total &quot;Musicalische Temperatur&quot;  112+135=247=13*19<br/>    (mediator:)        CHRISTUS = 112        1 = UNITAS<br/>                                              3=TRINITAS<br/>                           closure of circle:   19.</p><p>This was Werckmeister; &quot;predecessor&quot; of JSB.<br/>_________________________________________________<br/>Going further in Gematria, a striking example, Bach&apos;s title:</p><p>12 letters  again 12 letters  :   partition, UNITAS=mediator<br/>DAS WOHLTEMPE     RIRTE CLAVIER<br/>   133               133      Totalling: 266= 14*19<br/>                                              BACH =14=2+6+6<br/>CHRISTUS = mediator<br/>                              closure of circle: 19.</p><p>This final application below of Gematria for baroque musicology<br/>proves beyond doubt that Werckmeister considered by no means<br/>the &quot;nominal system Werckmeister III&quot; as optimal!</p><p>Could any person of esprit and competent in harpsichord<br/>tuning take seriously a system having within C-G-D-A-E three<br/>tempered and one perfect fifth?<br/>Could anybody explain to me what are the sufficient reasons<br/>NOT to equalize these four fifths??<br/>This equalization of the four fifths leads from a temperament,<br/>structure of fifths 8+4 to a temperament 7+5 and this is achieved,<br/>provided the 5 tempered fifths are reduced by 370/369!<br/>                    *********************************<br/>The superparticular ratio of 369 is  370/369; (see my 2 publications<br/>quoted in my site on the Four Duets of Clavierubung III).</p><p>It is indispensable to have the facsimile of Werckmeister&apos;s<br/>&quot;Musicalische Temperatur&quot;.

Hence cutting this line was unjustified!<br/>What, then, are these particular reasons for Werckmeister&apos;s<br/>strange page-setup??</p><p>These reasons derive from the fact that, in view of baroque musical<br/>acoustics and mathematics, one worked in terms of<br/>superparticular ratios:</p><p>The superparticular ratio of N is defined as (N+1)/N.<br/>The simple intervals<br/>octave, fifth, fourth and major third are the SUP.

But how do you know that this was<br/>&gt; Werckmeister&apos;s doing.</p><p>*It is most likely and acceptable that the engraved plate was done by an<br/>*engraver or a draftsman. As you know, in some of his publications<br/>*Werckmeister complained about deficient skill of the work of his draftsman.<br/>*The text itself was set by the printing workshop. Werckmeister&apos;s<br/>*instructions and commanding must have driven the printers close to crazy.</p><p>I am not sure it is in Werckmeister&apos;s hand.  We know<br/>&gt; that the monochord drawing was by someone other than Werckmeister, according<br/>&gt; to Lindley.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Frankly, with so much writing, much of it verbose, or even unnecessary by<br/>&gt; today&apos;s standards,</p><p>Here, one should better think about the FINALITY of acting! In order<br/>to make sure arriving at p.75 with chapter 28(=secundus numerus perfectus)<br/>Werckmeister had to fill up a sufficient number of his treaises&apos; preceding<br/>pages with no matter what! With unconspicuos matter and, in the limit, with<br/>blabla that just serves to push &quot;Das XVIII. Capitel&quot; onto page 75! If no<br/>really substantial material is available, and you work under the FINALITY to<br/>attain with Cap. 28 the page 75 of 7 perfect and 5 well-tempered fifths,<br/>haven&apos;t you then necessarily to be verbose???</p><p>My lifetime is, like of anybody else, limited; and so, at best will and<br/>intentions, I cannot retype here my thoroughly elaborated text of :</p><p>Kellner, H.A.: A propos d&apos;une r&iuml;&iquest;&half;impression de la &quot;Musicalische Temperatur&quot;<br/>(1691) de Werckmeister.

It might be useful for your position ++++++++</p><p>I feel perfectly happy with my position!</p><p>Under the hypothesis, Werckmeister intended to encode at an unique<br/>opportunity his preferred system (ref. my EHM-articles above on<br/>Werckmeister), I would waste my lifetime to check into titles of his<br/>other treatises. I suggest you do it yourself and report here your<br/>observations and any results that you deem significant.<br/>Or do you really expect he would have encoded a second time something as<br/>interesting as the system &quot;Werckmeister/Bach/wohltemperirt&quot;? Could it<br/>possibly be an everydays&apos; event to encode such features this subtle way<br/>into a title?</p><p>&gt; ++++++++++to locate Gematria<br/>&gt; present in the other Werckmeister titles.  But this book was one among many<br/>&gt; that he authored, on different subjects in music, and he consistently<br/>&gt; referred back to his 1691 publication for advanced expansion on temperament<br/>&gt; throughout his life.  I checked.  It doesn&apos;t seem believable that<br/>&gt; Werckmeister would encrypt the very thing that he is exposing for the first<br/>&gt; time on the world stage.</p><p>You do certainly know &quot;QUAERENDO INVENIETIS&quot; and thus, are familiar with<br/>baroque mentality. Also, Kuhnau&apos;s riddle in Gematria, from the preface<br/>of his Biblische Historien Sonaten has now been common lore for some time.<br/>Isn&apos;t it? Kuhnau utilizes, incidentally, the same gematria as Werckmeister<br/>or J. S. Bach.</p><p>&gt;<br/>&gt; I understand that you exposed the unequal circle idea for Bach in this<br/>&gt; century and it is to your credit. However, your &quot;obscure and arcane&quot; variant<br/>&gt; to Werckmeister III is indistinguishable from it. Working presently on a<br/>&gt; performance of the Brandenburg Concerto No. 4, I have a laboratory for<br/>&gt; exploring this, but I prefer the 3 identical perfect fourths of 504 cents in<br/>&gt; Werckmeister III found in G Major, rather than the non-repeating ones of 503<br/>&gt; and 502.</p><p>*The system &quot;wohltemperirt&quot; is the authentic one for &quot;Das wohltemperirte<br/>*Clavier&quot;. You claim, it is indistinguishable from Werckmeister III.<br/>*Don&apos;t you realize that you are in CONTRADICTION with yourself, when<br/>*you &quot;prefer&quot; Werckmeister III - didn&apos;t you just claim, they are<br/>&quot;INDISTINGUISHABLE&quot;?</p><p>&gt; The motif of the last movement needs the fullest stretch for a<br/>&gt; perfect fifth for greatest intonational effect, to my taste.</p><p>&quot;de gustibus non est disputandum &quot;</p><p>504, no more,<br/>&gt; and the movement has a wonderful momentum and tempo.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I congratulate you on your original thinking, but I think Werckmeister<br/>&gt; invented the term &quot;wohl-temperirt&quot; not Bach.</p><p>I fully agree. And, in view of the properties of Bach&apos;s title,<br/>&quot;Das wohltemperirte Clavier,&quot; seen together with its unexpected<br/>properties, parallel to Werckmeister&apos;s title - as a predecessor -<br/>&quot;Musicalische Temperatur&quot;, it would be a vain effort to expect here any<br/>&quot;technological&quot; or specialized-jargon-experession.</p><p>&gt; Also, Werckmeister does not<br/>&gt; take credit for inventing the tuning, and I believe him.  He certainly was<br/>&gt; aware of other chromaticists that were using it in Thuringia, maybe back to<br/>&gt; Michael Bach of Erfurt, known for his chromaticisms, and the first Bach<br/>&gt; superstar.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I hope that you are not offended by my honest answers to your posts.</p><p>* Let&apos;s keep calm and not emotional in our sometimes heated discussion!!</p><p>&gt; I am actually deeply interested in &quot;Bach&apos;s Tuning&quot; and have been<br/>&gt; researching a book.  The very difference between our favorites is really<br/>&gt; so very little.</p><p>Bach has selected, so to speak, nothing less than &quot;wohltemperirt&quot; as<br/>the basis for his personal signet. (This was No. 2 and the definitive<br/>one of his signets. Its first usage we are aware of, is on 15. 3. 1722,<br/>a document to Erfurt).</p><p>Furthermore, upon inspection, Bach has structured his ENTIRE musical<br/>oeuvre utilizing the set of numbers belonging to &quot;wohltemperirt&quot;. But<br/>to reveal and document this fact, will be occupying students of musicology<br/>desperate for subjects suitable for doctoral thesis&apos; work during several<br/>decades, after other topics for investigation are exhausted. I have<br/>managed to study up to now only a small sample of Bach&apos;s work and will<br/>wind this activity up soon.</p><p>And if you prefer in &quot;Auff&iuml;&iquest;&half;hrungspraxis&quot; Werckmeister III, that could<br/>certainly not provoke any ploblem, let alone, catastrophy. But in case<br/>one is interested to discover the arcane methods of how J. S.Bach he<br/>structured his compositions, one will be startled - provided one<br/>possesses that that mathematically derived &quot;set of numbers&quot; By their means<br/>one should look into the structure of Bach&apos;s compositions.</p><p>I refer to my about 50 references to my publications in:</p><p>htt://ha.kellner.bei.t-online.de</p><p>&gt; There is no time to hear the beats in any live performance, after all.<br/>&gt; It is just that Werckmeister III is not OBVIOUSLY FALLACIOUS.  This<br/>&gt; overwrought statement sends me running in the other direction.</p><p>W III in live performance, might, admittedly, be MARGINALLY different<br/>from Werckmeister&apos;s &quot;wohltemperirt&quot;. And yet, organ builders do prefer<br/>the system for their baroque-style organs that have between C and E,<br/>FOUR equal fifths. Each one of them is better than the Werckmeister-fifth<br/>of 8+4. It is clear, because &quot;wohltemperirt&quot; is structured 7+5! There are<br/>by now, 26 years after 1975, about 300 pipe-organs tuned this way. WHY???<br/>How many W III  organs,  in contradistinction,  do there exist! WHY???</p><p>&gt; Talk of inferior makes no<br/>&gt; sense when their is no great improvement in harmony.  After all, Werckmeister<br/>&gt; III enhances counterpoint at the expense of harmony.  The separate lines are<br/>&gt; more distinguishable from each other in Werckmeister III, making it superior.</p><p>The technological reasons, why &quot;wohltemperirt&quot; is superior to W III, are laid<br/>out in:</p><p>Kellner, H.A.: Temperaments for all 24 Keys - A Systems Analysis.
