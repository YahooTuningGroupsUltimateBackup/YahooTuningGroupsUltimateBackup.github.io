Gene&apos;s statment above, as I read it, was merely<br/>setting the stage for evaluating your objective claims, whatever they<br/>may be. In other words, if you make an objective claim (and the same<br/>goes for Gene, me, Ellis, Pythagoras, or anyone else), it should be<br/>admissible for anyone to attempt to either prove it or refute it, and<br/>the latter is most easily done with a counterexample, so Gene and I<br/>have set a few alteratives to *test* as possible counterexamples. All<br/>Gene says above is that a certain scale is &quot;a good thing to keep in<br/>mind when testing&quot; objective claims. &quot;A good thing to keep in mind&quot;<br/>is very different from &quot;superior&quot;. I hope you will keep an open mind<br/>in case there *does* arise a counterexample you haven&apos;t previously<br/>considered; and if you&apos;ve proved that there isn&apos;t, you should sit<br/>confident in the fact that no one will ever find a counterexample,<br/>try as they might.</p><p>Your subjective, aesthetic claims, which may include your criteria<br/>for choosing your scale, are of completely up to you, and no one<br/>else, to define. However, I sincerely hope you will keep an open mind<br/>about those as well, since there are always new and unexpected<br/>musical experiences awaiting all of us, that can shape our aesthetic<br/>criteria, not to mention logical insights which can help us better<br/>express our aesthetic goals in mathematical or other more &apos;universal&apos;<br/>terms. I have learned much in my seven years on this list along all<br/>of these lines, and it is my hope that you, a fine musician, will<br/>stick around long enough for some true sharing and growing to occur.</p><p>Yours,<br/>Paul</p></div><h3>Peter Wakefield Sault &#x3C;sault@cyberware.co.uk&#x3E;</h3><span>12/5/2003 3:20:29 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>&gt; --- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;Gene Ward Smith&quot; &lt;gwsmith@s...&gt;<br/>wrote:<br/>&gt; &gt; Here is a comparison of Sault&apos;s Dodekaphone vs Ellis&apos; Duodene:<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; Sault: 6 6/5&apos;s 7 5/4&apos;s 9 3/2&apos;s, for a total of 22<br/>&gt; &gt; Ellis: 6 6/5&apos;s 8 5/4&apos;s 9 3/2&apos;s for a total of 23<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; Sault: 5 major triads 6 minor triads for a total of 11<br/>&gt; &gt; Ellis: 6 major triads 6 minor triads for a total of 12<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; The advantage appears to be with Ellis, and the Duodene to be a<br/>&gt; good<br/>&gt; &gt; thing to keep in mind when testing claims about the unique<br/>&gt; excellence<br/>&gt; &gt; of the Dodekaphone.</p><p>I see what you are doing now.

You are in some way<br/>paralleling the linear vs logarithmic (or arithmetic vs geometric)<br/>nature of our consciousness - that a geometric progression of<br/>vibration number gives us an arithmetic progression of pitch<br/>sensation. And I agree with you that &apos;pain&apos; is a perfectly good way<br/>of describing the sensation of discord, although the term &apos;discord&apos;<br/>always was perfectly adequate for the purpose. Your words still make<br/>perfect sense if &apos;discord&apos; is substituted for &apos;pain&apos;.</p><p>I have discovered that scales are not even needed for music per se.<br/>Scales, like tunings, are a matter of the practicalities of playing<br/>polytonal instruments, especially in concert with other musicians.</p><p>However, a sequence of pitches does not need a reference tone except<br/>for dum-diddly-um-pum type melodies (please excuse my simplistic<br/>rendition of Mozart et al.). All that is needed is that the<br/>instantaneous experience of &apos;melody&apos; relate back at least a few<br/>seconds (abs max = 8 secs) - the duration of &apos;blind&apos; memory.<br/>Otherwise than that an aesthetic progression of notes need only<br/>relate to the preceding notes by harmonious intervals. I will record<br/>a sample for you to listen to as soon as I have got my old 486 out of<br/>its box and connected up again - my ancient demo software for this<br/>stuff is DOS-only and plays the PC speaker because that was and still<br/>is the only way I can produce tones by frequency. Perhaps someday it<br/>will occur to the geniuses who produce synthesizers that vibration<br/>number is infinitely more rational than &apos;cents&apos;.</p><p>As I have already announced elsewhere in my usual arrogant manner I<br/>am not going to waste so much as a second of my life dealing<br/>with &apos;cents&apos; up or down from concert tunings. Give it to me as<br/>vibration numbers or frequency ratios - or keep it to yourself.<br/>That&apos;s my attitude and I&apos;m sticking to it.</p><p>P.</p></div><h3>Peter Wakefield Sault &#x3C;sault@cyberware.co.uk&#x3E;</h3><span>12/7/2003 10:27:05 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, Carl Lumma &lt;ekin@l...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt; I hope you do.

If this becomes impractical<br/>then the communication ends.  This is something that may happen.  It need<br/>not be announced in advance with a lot of show.  If it involves a genuine<br/>difficulty on your part then everyone will be most glad to help you<br/>translate things to terms you are familiar with.  If you simply refuse to<br/>experience difficulty while everyone else around you picks up the slack,<br/>then you simply end relationship, and that is your choice.

However you may be<br/>&gt; making a bigger thing out of it in advance of an actual *particular* need<br/>&gt; to communicate in a specific focused area.  When an actual need to<br/>&gt; communicate comes up, the terms used will end up being negotiated on the<br/>&gt; fly.  If one person won&apos;t give, the other one perhaps will.  If this<br/>&gt; becomes impractical then the communication ends.  This is something that<br/>&gt; may happen.  It need not be announced in advance with a lot of show.  If it<br/>&gt; involves a genuine difficulty on your part then everyone will be most glad<br/>&gt; to help you translate things to terms you are familiar with.  If you simply<br/>&gt; refuse to experience difficulty while everyone else around you picks up the<br/>&gt; slack, then you simply end relationship, and that is your choice.<br/>&gt; Relationships where one side does all the work tend to be short-lived,<br/>&gt; except under exceptional conditions.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; All of us have similar preferences in various areas of terminology and ways<br/>&gt; of thinking about things, though perhaps most of us feel in advance more<br/>&gt; willingness to work on our side of the translation, rather than require<br/>&gt; others to do all the translation for us.  Nonetheless in many cases these<br/>&gt; individual preferences can go almost unnoticed when things to communicate<br/>&gt; are simply dealt with as they come up.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; So I&apos;m saying that arrogance is merely a style, which is perhaps what you<br/>&gt; are also saying.  When push comes to shove everyone will see how it turns<br/>&gt; out.  And it won&apos;t matter one whit to anyone here whether you forget<br/>&gt; yourself one day and find that for some unforseen reason it suddenly<br/>&gt; becomes worthwhile to know what cents means!  ;)  Heck have you ever<br/>&gt; incorrectly predited your future choices?

One produces MIDI streams and files<br/>and the other plays the PC speaker.</p><p>The MIDI streamer could not address Creative Soundblaster cards for<br/>the simple reason that the control codes were not published and did<br/>not correspond to the Roland MPU-401 standard. Creative wanted a ton<br/>of money from developers for the info, which was never guaranteed to<br/>be the actual control codes (it wasn&apos;t as it happens). So this<br/>version of ODEION could only be used with an actual Roland MPU-401<br/>and an external MIDI synthesizer. Roland later produced a MPU-401<br/>variant which took a Roland wavetable synth daughterboard and would<br/>send audio direct to PC speakers, and I still possess it.</p><p>The PC speaker version directly programs the PC timer chip in order<br/>to produce a continuous sound spectrum. Winduhs does not like this<br/>and tends to lock up pretty quickly if it is tried in its pseudo-DOS<br/>window. The purpose of the PC speaker version was to enable<br/>modulation by dynamic retuning of Justly Intonated scales relative to<br/>the modulation bridge note.</p><p>Hope that clarifies the matter. As for providing the source code, it<br/>comprises a high-level shell written in BASIC for the IBM BASIC<br/>Compiler v1.00 which links assembly-language object library to create<br/>an EXE file. All the action takes place in the assembly language. For<br/>either program to even work on the computer on which it was all put<br/>together, an original IBM PC-XT (I owned the first one delivered in<br/>the UK, as it happens) with a 4MHz 8088 processor, many tricks were<br/>necessary. For example, I do not pass variables in the usual manner,<br/>as parameters. Instead their segment:offset addresses are passed as<br/>parameters once-only at program initialization and thereafter the<br/>data is referenced directly at its fixed address by both the caller<br/>and the routines. This is single-thread programming, remember.</p><p>Also, all scales are defined as 12-bits of 16-bit integers, with a<br/>one-to-one bit-to-pitchnumber mapping. Thus modes of scales are<br/>produced by in-register rotations of these integers.</p><p>These are just examples.

You see MIDI is a clunky old piece of crap and one vital<br/>piece of information has always been missing from its specification.<br/>The KEY of each note. I had to design special data files for ODEION<br/>where each note is defined as a tonic pitch number (0-128) plus<br/>offset (0-11). MIDI is incapable of this - and therefore useless for<br/>my purposes. My ODEION files are translated to MIDI only for the<br/>purpose of final performance. To work with the tonic + offset data,<br/>ODEION contains its own editor. Also please note once again that a<br/>modulation bridge note may not be the tonic of either the preceding<br/>or subsequent key, so it is no good retuning relative to the new<br/>tonic. The retuning absolutely has to be relative to the bridge note.</p><p>Peter</p></div><h3>Peter Wakefield Sault &#x3C;sault@cyberware.co.uk&#x3E;</h3><span>12/8/2003 12:59:23 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;Aaron K.

Well done Aaron. I note it is contrapuntal - is it<br/>also<br/>&gt; &gt; possible to generate chord progressions this way?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Thank you! Yes, chord progressions are possible....<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; Also, note that the &quot;1/3-comma meantone&quot; of Rameau (and popular<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; in Europe during the meantone era) closes very nearly after 19<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; tones.  So nearly that 19-tET is indistinguishable from 1/3-<br/>comma<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; meantone (it has Just minor thirds).  So what has a wolf in 12<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; has none in 19!<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; But why 19? Why not 18 (i.e. 6 tones each divided in 3 instead of<br/>2)?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; 19-tet has a very nearly pure minor third, a better approximation<br/>to a major<br/>&gt; 3rd than 12-tet, and a flatter fifth than et, but still functions<br/>and is<br/>&gt; recognizable as such, just a bit more active.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; 18-tet has a 12-tet major third, a very much sharp minor third, and<br/>an<br/>&gt; unusable for traditional harmony perfect fifth.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; take your pick....if you want to do alien music, 18 works well ;)<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; And how can anything that is ET contain anything that is Natural?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Hmm....it seems elsewhere that you defend 12-tet concerts and<br/>music.<br/>&gt; &apos;Naturalness&apos; doesn&apos;t come in to your argument there! Or do I<br/>misunderstand<br/>&gt; you?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; Surely they are mutually exclusive? Either each chromatic<br/>interval is<br/>&gt; &gt; 19th root 2 (ET) or it is a ratio of whole numbers (&apos;Natural&apos; - I<br/>&gt; &gt; must say I restrict my use of &apos;Just&apos; to mean natural dodekaphony<br/>for<br/>&gt; &gt; reasons which are just too long-winded to go into here and now)?<br/>And<br/>&gt; &gt; what principle does one use to generate melodic scales? Obviously<br/>it<br/>&gt; &gt; cannot be transposed sequences of 5ths (or can it?) because one<br/>&gt; &gt; cannot get 2:3 (1.5) from 19th root 2.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Neither does one have 2:3 in 12-tet!!! each ET will have different<br/>&gt; approximations to various important Just intervals....19-tet has a<br/>fifth with<br/>&gt; a ratio of 1.49375896165449 as opposed to 1.5...perfectly<br/>listenable and<br/>&gt; recognizable as a &apos;fifth&apos;, though a bit more active and insistent<br/>due to its<br/>&gt; faster beating. It stands at 694.7368 cents as opposed to 700 cents<br/>for the<br/>&gt; 12-tet fifth (BTW, cents are a very good measure of the relative<br/>perceptual<br/>&gt; fatness and sharpness of intervals, you plea for a ratios only<br/>approach<br/>&gt; aside)<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; For the metaphysician, 19-tet is also justifiable as a being very<br/>closely<br/>&gt; approximated by a chain of 19 just minor thirds.

I&apos;m a bit afraid<br/>&gt; that I&apos;m going to have to constantly out-do &apos;Juggler&apos; to stay compositionally<br/>&gt; relevant. And to have a larger work or body of works. But, one just must<br/>&gt; write and hope for the best, no? Unfortunately, I feel dry right now ;(<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I am really thankful and thrilled that people have recieved it so warmly,<br/>&gt; though :)<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Best,<br/>&gt; Aaron.</p><p>Hey.  I like the piece a lot myself, yet as is often the case, I have to<br/>&quot;suspend&quot; my dislike for the synthesized medium in order to try to hear the<br/>music.  But I am able to do this.  Partly because I very much *want* to do<br/>this.  My significant-other does not want to do this - so she does not like<br/>the piece much and feels unable to hear what 19-et might offer, as a result.</p><p>I&apos;d like to see a midi file for the piece, and try to come up with a way of<br/>rendering it to make it palatable to those with different tastes.

However you<br/>may be<br/>&gt; &gt; making a bigger thing out of it in advance of an actual<br/>*particular* need<br/>&gt; &gt; to communicate in a specific focused area.  When an actual need to<br/>&gt; &gt; communicate comes up, the terms used will end up being negotiated<br/>on the<br/>&gt; &gt; fly.  If one person won&apos;t give, the other one perhaps will.  If<br/>this<br/>&gt; &gt; becomes impractical then the communication ends.  This is<br/>something that<br/>&gt; &gt; may happen.  It need not be announced in advance with a lot of<br/>show.  If it<br/>&gt; &gt; involves a genuine difficulty on your part then everyone will be<br/>most glad<br/>&gt; &gt; to help you translate things to terms you are familiar with.

Regardless, the last note is<br/>*enharmonically equivalent* to the first in 19-tone equal<br/>temperament, just as in 12-tone equal temperament, a chain of 12<br/>perfect fifths leads to a note enharmonically equivalent to the first<br/>note.

Every<br/>natural scale that has a single central pitch class has a<br/>complementary pair at that position. Perhaps I am just the first to<br/>acknowledge this rather than trying to skate around the issue. For<br/>practical purposes on traditional fixed pitch instruments (i.e. not<br/>viols etc) only one can be used. But in the theoretical arithmetic I<br/>can see two. I doubt very strongly that many, if any, musicians can<br/>distinguish between 32:45 and 45:64. It is a proven fact of<br/>perception that, despite the presence of an audible beat, when two<br/>notes get close enough together it is impossible to tell which is the<br/>higher and which is the lower. The technique used by piano tuners in<br/>this situation is always to back off a bit (i.e. to detune) and then<br/>to bring the two together again, repeatedly until no beat can be<br/>detected.</p></div><h3>Kurt Bigler &#x3C;kkb@breathsense.com&#x3E;</h3><span>12/9/2003 9:54:51 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>on 12/9/03 9:10 PM, Peter Wakefield Sault &lt;<a href="mailto:sault@cyberware.co.uk">sault@cyberware.co.uk</a>&gt; wrote:</p><p>&gt; --- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;Gene Ward Smith&quot; &lt;gwsmith@s...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;&gt; --- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;Peter Wakefield Sault&quot; &lt;sault@c...&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt; I quote from the &apos;Oxford Companion to Music&apos;, since you are now<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt; demanding citations:-<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt; &quot;The diatonic scales are the major and minor, made up of tones<br/>&gt; and<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt; semitones (in the case of the harmonic minor scale, also an<br/>&gt;&gt; augmented<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt; second), as distinct from the chromatic, made up entirely of<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt; semitones.

It is<br/>(16/15)/(25/24) = 128/125. The diatonic semitone of 16/15 and the<br/>chromatic semitone of 25/24 are of course not equal in just<br/>intonation, but they are also not equal in, eg, 1/4 comma meantone.<br/>In other words C#&apos;, which is a major third above A, is a chromatic<br/>semitone above C&apos;; whereas Db, a major third below F, is a diatonic<br/>semitone above C. The two are equal in the 12-et version of meantone,<br/>or in any system where the major third is equated to the cube root of<br/>two, but 16/15 is larger than 25/24 in just intonation, and in the<br/>more authentic meantone systems with fifths flatter than those of 12-<br/>et we also have that major thirds are flatter than those of 12-et and<br/>the chromatic semitone smaller than the diatonic semitone.</p><p>For instance if we divide the octave into 31 parts, then<br/>a fifth is 18 parts and a major third 10 parts. The diatonic semitone<br/>corresponds to 2*(2/3)*(4/5), so it is 31-18-10=3 parts. The<br/>chromatic semitone corresponds to (1/2)*(5/3)*(5/4), and<br/>5/3 = 2*(2/3)*(5/4), so it has 31-18+10=23 parts, and so the chromatc<br/>semitone has -31+23+10=2 parts. The two semitones taken together<br/>produce the single full tone, which is neither a 9/8 or a 10/9 but<br/>about half-way between--ie, a *mean* tone.

But not by retuning all tones as<br/>it should be done when creating different &quot;well tempered&quot; tuning models.<br/>This would be impossible. Impossible, too, for Bach.<br/>  They handle it as follows:<br/>  The tuning model is a meantone temperament. For instance in the standard<br/>line from Eb to G#, which means: The major chords beginning  with Eb-G-Bb<br/>and ending with E-G#-B are tuned to good frequency ratios. With this model<br/>music in the the keys Bb major, F major, C major and so on, ending with<br/>A-major (and their minor parallels) can be performed.<br/>  If they want  to change to a piece in Ab major they tune upwards the G# to<br/>an Ab and the C# to a Db.<br/>  Inverse, to a piece in E major they tune downwards the Eb to a D#.<br/>  Indeed, retuning one tone in all octaves required less than ten minutes.<br/>  Is there no well educated harpsichord  player beyond us?<br/>  Werner Mohrlok</p><p>        Yahoo!

Bach might have intuitiviely/unconsciously realized that 12et was<br/>just a bad idea (to him), that is he might never have even considered<br/>thinking about it for longer than a millisecond.  So for him it would have<br/>been a sporadic neural firing that disappeared into the noise.  ;)</p><p>I&apos;m not really saying 12et is all bad.  It is quite good for octatonic, for<br/>example.  My recent experiences indicate that 12et may be a *particularly*<br/>bad choice for piano though, i.e. if you were looking for what tuning would<br/>create the most unpleasant attack transients 12et would be ideal.  I&apos;ll have<br/>more to say about that at another time.</p><p>-Kurt</p></div>
