Cover the small stuff. Reduce in size. Then<br/>cover the larger, broader strokes of color &quot;touch-up&quot;.</p><p>&gt; Waiting *ear*gerly for its theoretical significance.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Thanks,<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Jacky Ligon</p><p>JG: It&apos;s GREAT to find some interest out there!.... :)</p><p>Sincerely,  J Gill</p></div>
