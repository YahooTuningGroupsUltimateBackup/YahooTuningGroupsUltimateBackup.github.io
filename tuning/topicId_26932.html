As the<br/>microtemperament thread suggests, this can be a matter of taste.</p><p>If we choose to keep the pure major thirds of 1/4-comma meantone, or<br/>the pure minor thirds of 1/3-comma meantone, then what kinds of<br/>asymmetries result?</p><p>Here&apos;s a table to summarize the discussion which follows:</p><p>-------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>                31 notes: 1/4-comma meantone or 31-tET<br/>-------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>                       1/4-comma                    31-tET<br/>...................................................................<br/>31-comma              ~-6.07 cents                  0 cents<br/>(31 5ths - 18 8ves)<br/>...................................................................<br/>Fifths               30 at ~696.57 cents          ~696.77 cents<br/>                     (~5.38 cents narrow)      (~5.18 cents narrow)<br/>                     ....................<br/>                      1 at ~702.65 cents<br/>                     (~0.69 cents wide)<br/>...................................................................<br/>Major 3rds           27 at ~386.31 cents          ~387.10 cents<br/>                     (pure 5:4)                (~0.78 cents wide)<br/>                     ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,<br/>                      4 at ~392.38 cents<br/>                     (~6.07 cents wide)<br/>...................................................................<br/>minor 3rds           28 at ~310.26 cents          ~309.68 cents<br/>                     (~5.38 cents narrow)      (~5.96 cents narrow)<br/>                     ....................<br/>                      3 at ~304.20 cents<br/>                    (~11.45 cents narrow)<br/>-------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>                19 notes: 1/3-comma meantone or 19-tET<br/>-------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>                       1/3-comma                    19-tET<br/>...................................................................<br/>19-comma              ~+0.94 cents                  0 cents<br/>(19 5ths - 11 8ves)<br/>...................................................................<br/>Fifths               18 at ~694.79 cents          ~694.74 cents<br/>                     (~7.17 cents narrow)      (~7.22 cents narrow)<br/>                     ....................<br/>                      1 at ~693.85 cents<br/>                     (~8.11 cents wide)<br/>...................................................................<br/>Major 3rds           15 at ~379.14 cents          ~387.10 cents<br/>                     (~7.17 cents narrow)       (~0.78 cents wide)<br/>                     ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,<br/>                      4 at ~378.21 cents<br/>                     (~8.11 cents narrow)<br/>...................................................................<br/>minor 3rds           16 at ~315.64 cents          ~315.79 cents<br/>                     (pure 6:5)                 (~0.15 cents wide)<br/>                     ....................<br/>                      3 at ~316.58 cents<br/>                     (~0.94 cents wide)<br/>-------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p>For 1/4-comma meantone in 31 notes, a quick answer focuses on the<br/>amount of about 6.07 cents by which 31 fifths would fall short of 18<br/>pure octaves.</p><p>In practice, what we do is tune a chain of 30 fifths (or 31 notes) in<br/>a given octave, and then tune an octave of the starting note, in<br/>effect letting the last &quot;odd&quot; fifth absorb the difference: this makes<br/>it about 6.07 cents larger than the others.</p><p>Since a regular fifth in this tuning is 1/4-comma narrow, about 5.38<br/>cents, this means that our &quot;odd&quot; fifth is actually very slightly<br/>_wider_ than pure by about (6.07 - 5.38) cents, or ~0.69 cents, at<br/>around 702.65 cents. As it turns out, our odd fifth is almost just,<br/>much closer to pure than the regular ones.</p><p>How will this affect the sizes of major and minor thirds? It doesn&apos;t<br/>have any effect on the 27 regular major thirds or 28 regular minor<br/>thirds built from four regular fifths up or three regular fifths down<br/>respectively. These intervals remain at their usual sizes: the pure<br/>major thirds at 5:4, of course; and the usual minor thirds at<br/>1/4-comma narrow of a pure 6:5 (~315.64 cents), or ~310.26 cents.</p><p>However, four &quot;odd&quot; major thirds will have that near-pure fifth as one<br/>of the four fifths in their tuning chains, and these will be ~6.07<br/>cents _larger_ than a pure 5:4, or ~392.38 cents.</p><p>Also, three &quot;odd&quot; minor thirds will have this fifth in their chains,<br/>and these will be ~6.07 cents _narrower_ than their usual tempered<br/>size, for a total temperament of around (6.07 + 5.38) cents or ~11.45<br/>cents, producing a size of around 304.20 cents.</p><p>These minor asymmetries are actually much smaller than those which<br/>occur in circulating well-temperaments of the late 17th-19th<br/>centuries, and their main effect is simply to add a bit of<br/>intonational variety. We get one near-pure fifth, four odd major<br/>thirds wide by a bit less than in 1/6-comma meantone, and three odd<br/>minor thirds somewhat more heavily tempered, but still less so than in<br/>12-tET.</p><p>In 31-tET, a kind of &quot;microtempered&quot; version of this tuning, all 31<br/>fifths are ~5.18 cents narrow, or ~696.77 cents; all 31 major thirds<br/>are slightly wider than pure, about 0.78 cents, at ~387.10 cents; and<br/>all 31 minor thirds are about 5.96 cents narrow, at ~309.68 cents.</p><p>How about a 19-note system based on 1/3-comma meantone? Here 19 fifths<br/>tempered by 1/3-comma would come to about 0.94 cents _more_ than 11<br/>pure octaves.</p><p>In practice, this means that we tune a chain of 18 fifths (19 notes)<br/>per octave, and then an octave of the starting note. This time, in<br/>effect, the last &quot;odd&quot; fifth is made _narrower_ than the others, which<br/>are 1/3-comma or ~7.17 cents smaller than pure.</p><p>This means that our odd fifth will be _more_ impure than the others,<br/>tempered by ~8.11 cents in the narrow direction, at around 693.85<br/>cents. This might be comparable to the 1/3 _Pythagorean_ comma, or<br/>~7.82 cents, by which a few fifths are tempered in some<br/>well-temperaments. We really might prefer that the adjustment were in<br/>the other direction, but the odd fifth remains &quot;playable&quot; by most<br/>standards.</p><p>While this &quot;odd&quot; fifth won&apos;t affect the sizes of the 15 major thirds<br/>and 16 minor thirds built from chains of regular fifths, it will<br/>affect the other four major thirds and three minor thirds including it<br/>in their chains.</p><p>In 1/3-comma meantone, the usual major thirds are tempered 1/3-comma<br/>narrow of pure, or ~7.17 cents, at around 379.14 cents; the four odd<br/>ones with the extra-narrow fifth in their chains will be ~0.94 cents<br/>narrower, or ~8.11 cents, at ~378.21 cents.</p><p>The usual minor thirds in this tuning are a pure 6:5, and the three<br/>odd ones will be _larger_ than pure by ~0.94 cents, or ~316.58 cents.</p><p>How does this compare with 19-tET, where all fifths are about 7.22<br/>cents narrow, or about 0.05 cents more than in 1/3-comma meantone --<br/>thus distributing that difference of ~0.94 cents among all the fifths?</p><p>In 19-tET, all minor thirds are at around 315.79 cents, or ~0.15 cents<br/>wider than pure, much less than the 0.5 cents which Dave Keenan has<br/>suggested as one possible standard for musical &quot;justness.&quot;</p><p>Major thirds are all at around 378.95 cents, or ~7.37 cents narrower<br/>than just.</p><p>Anyway, I hope that this rather long post may make it clearer what<br/>that asymmetry of ~6.07 cents in a 31-note cycle of 1/4-comma meantone<br/>actually refers to, and also provide a bit more detail on the<br/>distinction between 19-tET and 1/3-comma meantone as circulating<br/>systems also.</p><p>Most appreciatively,</p><p>Margo Schulter<br/><a href="mailto:mschulter@value.net">mschulter@value.net</a></p></div><h3><a id=26954 href="#26954">ðŸ”—</a>jpehrson@rcn.com</h3><span>8/13/2001 7:52:53 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In tuning@y..., mschulter &lt;MSCHULTER@V...&gt; wrote:</p><p><a href="/tuning/topicId_26932.html#26932">/tuning/topicId_26932.html#26932</a></p><p>&gt; Hello, there, Joe Pehrson, and thank you for a question about<br/>&gt; circulating meantones which not only gives me the opportunity to<br/>&gt; clarify a point made in my &quot;New Music in 62 Tones,&quot; but also has<br/>&gt; provided me with an occasion to look at the problem in a way that<br/>I&apos;ll discuss in another article.<br/>&gt;</p><p>Thank you very much, Margo, for this careful post showing the<br/>differences between 31 notes of 1/4 comma meantone and 31-tET and<br/>between 19 notes of 1/3 comma meantone and 19-tET.</p><p>I wasn&apos;t, obviously, clear about that distinction when I first read<br/>your article.
