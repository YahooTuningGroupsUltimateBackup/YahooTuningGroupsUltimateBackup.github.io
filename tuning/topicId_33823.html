With the uptempo piece, the first improvisation, it<br/>was that cyclical progression that alternates bass notes and chords,<br/>and with the ballad, the second improvisation, it was that peculiar<br/>little expressionist melody.</p><p>To my way of thinking, this is music making in one of its more basic<br/>and honest forms--how one shapes new ideas and motifs into narratives<br/>with forward motion in real time on an instrument.</p><p>take care,</p><p>--Dan Stearns</p></div><h3>jpehrson2 &#x3C;jpehrson@rcn.com&#x3E;</h3><span>2/9/2002 11:55:19 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In tuning@y..., &quot;D.Stearns&quot; &lt;STEARNS@C...&gt; wrote:</p><p><a href="http://groups.yahoo.com/group/tuning/message/33823">http://groups.yahoo.com/group/tuning/message/33823</a></p><p>Dan, I listened carefully to all your pieces and enjoyed them very<br/>much.
