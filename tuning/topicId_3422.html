Medieval polyphony and &quot;5-limit&quot;<br/>-----------------------------------</p><p>First of all, not so surprisingly, I&apos;d like to agree with Paul&apos;s<br/>eloquent statements about the stylistic issues raised by any<br/>proposal for 5-limit tuning of medieval polyphony based on a<br/>quintal/quartal as opposed to tertian system of harmony. It does seem<br/>to me a great deal like proposing that Monteverdi or Beethoven were<br/>actually performed in 7-limit or 9-limit because these tunings are<br/>preferred by some 20th-century just intonation (JI) enthusiasts.</p><p>As Paul remarks, there may not be very much to add on this question,<br/>but I might mention an analysis of the opening of Machaut&apos;s Mass in<br/>Easley Blackwood&apos;s _The Structure of Recognizable Diatonic Tunings_<br/>which concludes that Pythagorean is much preferble to 5-limit.</p><p>Also, I&apos;m tempted to suggest that if one _must_ propose an alternative<br/>to Pythagorean (3-limit JI) for such music, why not something like<br/>12-tet, which would still permit relatively compact diatonic<br/>semitones, and leave thirds and sixths relatively active? If asked to<br/>perform Machaut in something other than 3-limit JI, I&apos;d certainly<br/>prefer 12-tet to 5-limit, as does Blackwood.</p><p>----------------------------------<br/>2. Marchettus: the Musical Context<br/>----------------------------------</p><p>Having alluded to the controversy between Marchettus of Padua (1318)<br/>and his critic Prosdocimus, who wrote about a century later to condemn<br/>his &quot;errors,&quot; I&apos;d like to make it clear that I do not share the<br/>negative judgment of the latter theorist, although I agree that the<br/>mathematics of Marchettus are not always clear.</p><p>In fact, I&apos;d like to urge that Marchettus is a stellar theorist and<br/>interpreter of a world of early 14th-century music, and that this<br/>mathematics be interpreted -- however uncertainly -- in the context of<br/>his general theory of concord and discord.</p><p>From this viewpoint, I would urge that far from advocating &quot;5-limit&quot;<br/>tuning, Marchettus is leaning toward something like a &quot;7-limit&quot; tuning<br/>for cadential thirds and sixths.</p><p>First of all, Marchettus emphasizes the instability of thirds as well<br/>as sixths by referring to these intervals as &quot;tolerable discords&quot; --<br/>in contrast to the typical 13th-14th century term &quot;imperfect<br/>concords.&quot; This may be a rather fine semantic distinction, but it<br/>hardly suggests a &quot;5-limit&quot; outlook which would seek more blending<br/>thirds and sixths than Pythagorean at the expense of wider<br/>leading-tones.</p><p>In fact, Marchettus deserves recognition and admiration for not only<br/>formulating the principle of &quot;close approach,&quot; but applying it as it<br/>were on a microtonal level. This principle requires that a third<br/>contracting to a unison be minor, and third expanding to a fifth, and<br/>likewise a sixth to an octave, be major. Marchettus carries this<br/>standard 14th-century rule further by calling for a cadential<br/>leading-tone as narrow as possible, in theory only a diesis equal to<br/>something like 1/5-tone or 2/9-tone (about half of a normal<br/>Pythagorean semitone at 256:243 or ~90.22 cents).</p><p>However one chooses to realize the precise mathematics -- and a<br/>leading-tone of around 28:27, associated with &quot;superwide&quot; cadential<br/>major thirds at around 9:7 and major sixths at around 12:7 is one<br/>possibility -- Marchettus is calling for _narrower_ leading-tones and<br/>_wider_ major thirds and sixths at cadences, the opposite of 5-limit.</p><p>As a curious aside, I might note for Paul&apos;s amusement that a literal<br/>reading of Marchettus&apos;s diesis might not be too far from a 22-tet step<br/>of ~54.55 cents.</p><p>-----------------------------<br/>3. Medieval English polyphony<br/>-----------------------------</p><p>As we have discussed, there is clear evidence for tertian harmony in<br/>some regions of 13th-century England, about two centuries before the<br/>transition to such a harmonic system (and to 5-limit or meantone) on<br/>the Continent. Monz raises the question of possible origins for this<br/>predilection.</p><p>A possible clue is given by Giraldus Cambrensis, a philosopher and<br/>traveller who records around 1200 that the people of certain regions<br/>in Britain have a unique style of part-singing. He suggests that they<br/>may have acquired this technique from the Danes, who had often invaded<br/>and occupied these same regions. If one couples these statements with<br/>those around 1275 from Coussemaker&apos;s Anonymous IV that thirds are<br/>counted &quot;the best concords&quot; in the &quot;Westcountry&quot; of England, then a<br/>tertian or &quot;5-limit&quot; interpretation of Giraldus is certainly possible.</p><p>Also, a Hymn to St. Magnus from the Orkney Islands for two voices<br/>mostly in parallel thirds may date from around this same era, and come<br/>from a seat of Norwegian culture. The Lydian mode of this piece might<br/>possibly also suggest a Scandinavian provenance, since this mode is a<br/>favorite, for example, in traditional Icelandic music.</p><p>Here it should be emphasized that English music of the 13th and 14th<br/>centuries varies a great deal in style, ranging from pieces actually<br/>ending with sonorities including thirds, to those more or less similar<br/>to Continental 3-limit music of the same era.</p><p>Exactly what intonation may have been used for the music of Dunstable<br/>(c.1370-1453) is an interesting question, although some approximation<br/>of 5-limit wouldn&apos;t be surprising.</p><p>-----------------------------------------------<br/>4. Hoppin and the Gothic/Renaissance transition<br/>-----------------------------------------------</p><p>As Paul notes, Hoppin&apos;s description of the &quot;paradigm shift&quot; from<br/>Gothic to Renaissance style during the epoch starting around 1420<br/>(e.g. the early Dufay) nicely captures the 3-limit to 5-limit<br/>transition. Here I&apos;d just like add one point which ties into my<br/>concluding remarks to follow about the relative &quot;sophistication&quot; of<br/>theory in 1300 and 1500.</p><p>While Hoppin rightly focuses on the much more restricted use of<br/>&quot;dissonance&quot; in Renaissance vis-a-vis Gothic style, I would like to<br/>add that from another viewpoint, the Gothic in practice and theory<br/>often treats major seconds or ninths and minor sevenths as to some<br/>degree &quot;concordant&quot; or &quot;compatible,&quot; while the Renaissance treats them<br/>as unequivocal discords.</p><p>This important change reflects two factors: the shift from 3-limit to<br/>5-limit in theory and practice, and the shift more specifically to a<br/>rather _homogenous_ 5-limit texture as the Renaissance ideal. While<br/>Hoppin nicely communicates the latter point, the first point may be of<br/>special interest from the viewpoint of tuning systems.</p><p>In a system like that of medieval Continental Europe, based on fifths<br/>and fourths as primary concords, the major second (9:8) and minor<br/>seventh (16:9) have some &quot;respectability.&quot; The first interval is the<br/>difference between a 3:2 fifth and a 4:3 fourth, while the second is<br/>the sum of two pure fourths. Likewise the major ninth (9:4) represents<br/>the sum of two pure fifths.</p><p>Even as bare intervals, M2 or M9 and m7 are held to be somewhat<br/>&quot;compatible&quot; by various medieval theorists of polyphony ranging from<br/>Guido d&apos;Arezzo (c. 1030) to Jacobus of Liege (c. 1325). Around 1200,<br/>when Perotin and other composers begin writing regularly for three or<br/>four voices, these intervals can actually have a relatively blending<br/>effect when combined with two fifths or fourths.</p><p>Thus Jacobus much likes the &quot;concordant&quot; effect of the major ninth<br/>when presented in a sonority with two fifths (e.g. G3-D4-A4, 4:6:9),<br/>or a minor seventh in a sonority with two fourths (e.g. G3-C4-F4,<br/>16:12:9). In 13th-century practice, a combination of fifth, fourth,<br/>and major second is also popular (e.g. G3-C4-D4, 6:8:9, or G3-A3-D4,<br/>8:9:12).</p><p>Such sonorities, also found in many other world polyphonies based on<br/>fifths and fourths as primary concords, give Gothic music an element<br/>of color and contrast. These sonorities have a kind of &quot;energetic<br/>blend&quot; which fits the overall quintal/quartal flavor but at the same<br/>time brings into play the considerable excitement and tension of the<br/>major second or ninth or minor seventh. From Perotin to Machaut, these<br/>relatively blending 3-limit sonorities (along with the unstable but<br/>relatively concordant thirds) are an attractive feature of the music.</p><p>In fact, Jacobus advocates what might be called an ideal of<br/>&quot;pancompatibility&quot;: _all_ the regular Pyhagorean intervals, except for<br/>outright &quot;discords&quot; (i.e. m2, M7, A4, d5, m6), may be used pleasingly<br/>in a wide range of vertical combinations, many of which he<br/>catalogues. Notably included in these essential combinations are M2,<br/>m7, and M9.</p><p>In contrast, the 15th-century style of &quot;panconsonance&quot; described by<br/>Hoppin relegates major seconds or ninths and minor sevenths to the<br/>status of restricted discords. This shift, advocated by &quot;modern&quot;<br/>14th-century theorists such as Johannes de Muris (or a student<br/>writing &quot;according to&quot; his teaching around 1320), gets more and more<br/>consistently implemented in practice starting around 1420, Hoppin&apos;s<br/>transitional epoch.</p><p>Also, during the epoch of 1420-1450 there seems to be an increasing<br/>tendency to avoid parallel fifths more consistently in practice as<br/>well as theory. Thirds and sixths more and more emerge as the<br/>privileged intervals: both the traditionally preferred fifths, and the<br/>&quot;9-based&quot; intervals of 3-limit (M2, m7, M9), lose their medieval<br/>liberties.</p><p>The result, as Hoppin eloquently describes, is a Renaissance ideal of<br/>rather homogenous textures flowing smoothly between tertian (5-limit)<br/>harmonies, meaning &quot;the third plus fifth or sixth&quot; (Zarlino, 1558).</p><p>Accompanying this shift in styles is a shift in tunings: from 3-limit<br/>JI as a medieval ideal for voices and a very practical keyboard<br/>scheme, to 5-limit JI as a vocal ideal and meantone for keyboards.</p><p>By 1477, Tinctoris is reporting the fashionable opinion that there is<br/>no music worth hearing save that written in the previous 40 years; and<br/>by 1482, Ramos is describing 5-limit JI and very likely some kind of<br/>meantone tuning for keyboards.</p><p>-------------------------------<br/>5. Theory between 1300 and 1500<br/>-------------------------------</p><p>From the above, it might be inferred that the concord/discord theory<br/>of a musician such as Jacobus around 1300 could actually be regarded<br/>as more &quot;sophisticated&quot; than that of the paradigm prevailing around<br/>1500. Jacobus, like many 20th-century theorists, finds that M2 or m7<br/>has a notable degree of &quot;concord,&quot; in contrast to m2 or M7. The<br/>Renaissance simply regards all seconds and sevenths as &quot;discords.&quot;</p><p>Here I do not wish to make invidious comparisons, since each theory<br/>nicely fits the style of a beautiful music. However, I do wish to<br/>counteract the common view of &quot;progress&quot; in which the 18th-century<br/>harmonic system becomes a kind of directive goal for all previous<br/>practice and theory. The 3-limit harmony of the 13th century is very<br/>beautiful, and very non-18th-century.</p><p>Monz raises the question as to whether medieval theorists described<br/>Pythagorean tuning because they did not have available the mathematics<br/>to describe anything else, theory&apos;s tools &quot;improving&quot; between 1300 and<br/>1500.</p><p>Here one might raise the question of why English theorists such as<br/>Theinred of Dover (13th c.?) and Walter Odington (c. 1300) write of<br/>thirds at or near ratios of 5:4 and 6:5, while the advocacy of such a<br/>tuning on the Continent only occurs around the time of Ramos<br/>(1482). To me, an attractive hypothesis would be that tertian or<br/>&quot;5-limit&quot; styles of harmony are recorded in regions of 13th-century<br/>England, but only became common in Continental composition during the<br/>15th century.</p><p>However, we are fortunate to have direct evidence that a Continental<br/>theorist around 1300 favoring Pythagorean tuning _was_ quite capable<br/>of describing 5-limit and 7-limit ratios.</p><p>Jacobus of Liege, in the Fourth Book of his _Speculum musicae_<br/>(&quot;MIrror of Music&quot;) comparing the various concords, remarks that it<br/>would be quite possible to build instruments using such interval<br/>ratios as 5:1 and 7:1, but that these intervals would not be properly<br/>formed in terms of whole-tones and semitones.</p><p>He goes on to demonstrate what we call the syntonic and septimal<br/>commas: 5:1 or 80:16 is smaller than the regular major third plus two<br/>octaves at 81:16 by a factor of 81:80; and 7:1 or 63:9 is smaller than<br/>the regular minor seventh plus two octaves at 64:9 by a factor of<br/>64:63.</p><p>The inquiring Jacobus also notes the gap between the classic 3-limit<br/>concords of the fifth (3:2) and fourth (4:3), and the next &quot;useable&quot;<br/>superparticular ratio (i.e. n+1:n) of the major second (9:8),<br/>suggesting that the quite &quot;imperfect&quot; quality of the latter concord<br/>may reflect this gap. Thus he recognizes that the intervening<br/>superparticular ratios (5:4, 6:5, 7:6, 8:7) are conceivable in theory,<br/>but don&apos;t fit the tuning system used in practice.</p><p>To me, this approach seems much like that of 20th-century authors who<br/>observe that the harmonic series indeed includes a seventh partial,<br/>but that it doesn&apos;t fit the tuning of classical European music. Those<br/>who appreciate the musical value of intervals at or near 7:4 may<br/>rightly emphasize that such authors are hardly exhausting the<br/>possibilities. However, the issue is one of style rather than of<br/>mathematics.</p><p>Around 1500, a mathematical change in music theory is indeed afoot:<br/>the recognition of the _irrational_ ratios needed to describe the new<br/>temperaments such as keyboard meantones or the coming 12-tet for<br/>lutes. This trend does indeed correlate with an interest in Euclidean<br/>geometry as a method for calculating organ pipes dividing a 9:8<br/>whole-tone into two equal parts, and eventually also with the<br/>16th-century admiration of Aristoxenes.</p><p>In my view, the shift in 15th-century theory toward 5-limit ratios<br/>nicely fits the changing practice of the times as described both by<br/>contemporary authors such as Tinctoris and by modern writers such as<br/>Hoppin.</p><p>Since a 5-limit system is indeed more complicated than a 3-limit<br/>system, theory inevitably became more complex; and at least one<br/>16th-century theorist argues that some vocal temperament is required<br/>in order to avoid undesired pitch shifts. Vicentino, by neatly<br/>proposing a 31-tet keyboard as a standard for vocalists, avoids such<br/>&quot;comma shift&quot; problems while opening up new microtonal possibilities<br/>with his 1/5-tones of the &quot;enharmonic genus.&quot;</p><p>One point not so often noted is that the Renaissance lost touch with<br/>Gothic theory and practice, and that it is fun to imagine how music<br/>history and theory might have been different, for example, if<br/>Monteverdi had cited the bold 3-limit minor sevenths of Machaut in<br/>justifying his own &quot;modern&quot; 5-limit liberties.</p><p>Most respectfully,</p><p>Margo Schulter<br/><a href="mailto:mschulter@value.net">mschulter@value.net</a></p></div>
