Many of the &apos;bad vibes&apos; I see in this FAQ pursuit<br/>come from some who see a psychoacoustic approach as limiting composers<br/>in some way.</p><p>I started a faq entry (though I am totally unqualified to do so). It<br/>is unfinished and enclosed.</p><p>---------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p>How many different ways are there to approach microtonality?</p><p>One of the frustrating aspects of the microtonal universe is<br/>that, since there is an infinite number of approaches one can<br/>take, and since each approach has passionate advocates,<br/>discussions of terms and approaches sometimes tend towards<br/>arguments borderring on the &apos;one true path&apos;.</p><p>As an example, Composer A insists on a certain pitch being<br/>expressed as a &quot;5/4&quot; versus the tonic of the composition.<br/>Composer B insists on a certain pitch being expressed as<br/>&quot;the 31st root of 2 to the 10th power&quot; versus the tonic.<br/>Composer C has yet another way of referring to this pitch<br/>mathematically, and insists on referring to it in their<br/>compositions as &quot;Fb&quot;.</p><p>Let us assume that the pitch in question is indistinguishable<br/>audibly for most listeners. Does this point to some failure<br/>for microtonality and/or the various approaches these composers<br/>are taking?</p><p>The answer is no since the rest of the composition and the<br/>rest of the composition process (which is primarilly a<br/>spiritual activity) may well be quite different.</p><p>This then is the truly liberating thing about<br/>microtonality, in that a composer can come to find a<br/>personal harmonic and melodic language which matches<br/>his/her inner music.</p><p>So how can a newbie &apos;ease into&apos; microtonatlity?</p><p>    overtone series<br/>      (show cents for piano tuning for 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 24 25 13 14 15)<br/>    just ionian mode / major scale<br/>      (1/1    9/8    5/4 4/3    3/2    5/3    15/8)<br/>      discuss choices for filling the inner intervals<br/>    other arbitrary scales formed from &apos;just intervals&apos;<br/>       septimal minor scales<br/>       pythagorean<br/>       links to everywhere...etc...<br/>    equal divisions of the 2:1<br/>      approximating just intervals<br/>         different musical connotations (&apos;5/4&apos; = E&apos; or 5/4 = Fb)<br/>         within limits<br/>         in arbitrary consistent sets<br/>      without approximating just intervals<br/>         ?<br/>    non 2:1 oriented scales<br/>      equal step sizes<br/>         BP<br/>         88cet</p><p>Obviously this is blowing up in my face! I was really just trying to<br/>document my approach which slowly led from overtone series to<br/>arbitrarily finding just tunings to fit my original 12tet music to<br/>looking at the resources in various &apos;EDOs&apos; that will provide important<br/>features from my 12tet music with the important features (for me)<br/>that 12tet lacks.</p><p>Bob Valentine</p></div><h3><a id=19273 href="#19273">ðŸ”—</a>jpehrson@rcn.com</h3><span>2/22/2001 8:37:20 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In tuning@y..., Robert C Valentine &lt;BVAL@I...&gt; wrote:</p><p><a href="/tuning/topicId_19251.html#19251">/tuning/topicId_19251.html#19251</a></p><p>&gt; Obviously this is blowing up in my face!

I wonder why Monz never came up<br/>with the simple  EDI... &quot;equal division of an interval,&quot; rather than<br/>EDO.  Dan Stearns is certainly right about the inapplicability of<br/>that term to so many scales... Bohlen-Pierce, scales that Dan<br/>frequently uses, and many others...</p><p>Would &quot;EDI&quot; be a better substitute for &quot;EDO&quot; or is there something<br/>wrong with it (??)</p><p>_______ _____ ____ ___<br/>Joseph Pehrson</p></div>
