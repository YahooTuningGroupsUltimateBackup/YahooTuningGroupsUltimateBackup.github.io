I&apos;m seriously<br/>&gt;thinking of canceling my Yahoo &quot;account&quot; over this.</p><p>Has anyone seen a rise in spam to the e-mail address listed in<br/>their Yahoo! user information?</p><p>Anyway, it&apos;s clear from the terms of service that they can change<br/>this again, at any time, without notice, as many times as they want.</p><p>Another rundown of moving options:</p><p>() Go to a private mailing list.  No ads or spam, but less<br/>exposure to the potential new members, and we&apos;d loose web access.</p><p>() Go with private web service too.  This would take somebody&apos;s time<br/>and/or money, but we could get all kinds of cool stuff that even<br/>Yahoo! doesn&apos;t have.</p><p>() Go with usenet.  This may expose our addresses to spamers, but<br/>you get to be on Google.</p><p>Which reminds me -- another potential concern is the fact that<br/>yahoo owns the archives.  Hopefully, somebody (Robert Walker) is<br/>keeping a running archive.  But even so, we loose the threading<br/>information that would be preserved in the Google/usenet combo.</p><p>-Carl</p><p>&gt;12.
