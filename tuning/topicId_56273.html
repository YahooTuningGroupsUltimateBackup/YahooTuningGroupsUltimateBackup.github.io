I first had to configurate<br/>my equipment in order to check the acoustic results.<br/>Nevertheless it seems, I am the first who is answering (?)</p><p>I repeat your question as to my understanding:</p><p>You ask whether the chord or harmonic configuration<br/>A-C-D could be regarded as a part of<br/>a major septh chord D-(F#)-A-C tuned to the natural<br/>frequency ratios 4 : (5) : 6 : 7<br/>so that A-C-D would be tuned to 6 : 7 : 8<br/>...or as a part of the minor septh chord D-(F)-A-C<br/>tuned to the natural frequency ratios 10 : (12) : 15 : 18<br/>so that A-C-D would be tuned to 15 : 18 : 20</p><p>I think, whether you should tune to one or to the other of both<br/>alternative cannot become answered by &quot;correct&quot; or<br/>&quot;incorrect&quot;. It only could be answered by yourself if you decide<br/>whether this combination of notes should get a major character<br/>or a minor character.<br/>Indeed, the sound result of 6 : 7 : 8 it much harder with a very distinct<br/>bass combinaton tone &quot;D&quot;. (This D paradoxical for my ears seems located<br/>near to a C#, nevertheless it is in correct resonance<br/>to the original D).</p><p>Best</p><p>Werner</p><p>   &gt; -----Urspr&iuml;&iquest;&half;ngliche Nachricht-----<br/>   &gt; Von: traktus5 [<a href="mailto:kj4321@hotmail.com">mailto:kj4321@hotmail.com</a>]<br/>   &gt; Gesendet: Samstag, 20.
