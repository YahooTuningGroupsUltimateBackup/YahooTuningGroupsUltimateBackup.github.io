I think it is much to soon to jump the gun and start making rules.<br/>    Lets take the 13/11 and the 19/16 as the basis of a minor chord. With the first we could have (transposed up an octave) 22/26/33 and the second 16/19/24 now the difference tones generated by the first are 4, 7, and 11 with the second 3,5,8. We can see that the difference of 19/16 will generate the third tone of our chord while in the first , the four will clash with the 33. The 16/19/24 is more consonant to my ear. Limits are mathematical constructs that get us into new areas, but we are no where close to drawing any<br/>conclusions as to how are musical mind perceives or processes information.  Also the work of LaMonte Young continues to pioneer music is all the area omitted by such rules. Our perception of processing harmonics is probably no more limited that our perception of colors!<br/>    On the other hand, just as LaMonte uses no 5s you as an aesthetic decision you might wish to explore the musical area below the 19th! v<br/>-- Kraig Grady<br/>North American Embassy of Anaphoria Island<br/><a href="http://www.anaphoria.com">www.anaphoria.com</a></p></div><h3><a id=394 href="#394">ðŸ”—</a>Paul H.

It&apos;s<br/>stronger than an interval-by-interval analysis would suggest, as<br/>evidenced by the instability of its utonal counterpart (which has the<br/>same intervals). Increasing the number of notes in a chord increases the<br/>strength of combination tones in a disproportionate way (due to the<br/>nonlinearity of difference tones and to the multiplicity of new<br/>intervals between various combinations of &quot;real&quot; notes and existing<br/>combination tones). Also, once there are more than two or three notes,<br/>the ear tries really hard to reduce the whole thing into a single<br/>complex tone, making harmonic series fragments advantageous.

Sethares theory explains<br/>&gt;this nicely.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;Obviously there is a grey area and it depends on timbre, vibrato etc. I<br/>&gt;might &gt;be persuaded to push the magic number to 19. But even so, 19:16<br/>&gt;just looks &gt;ridiculous to me (summing to 35). This is merely a 6:5 that&apos;s<br/>&gt;been flattened &gt;about 18 cents.</p><p>First of all, as some have already said, everything depends on musical<br/>context. (I think that principle is also sometimes lost in discussions on<br/>this forum about which scale is better than which.) I can think of musical<br/>contexts in which 19/16 would be much better than 6/5. The question is not<br/>necessarily which can be distinguished and identified, but which works<br/>better in the music.</p><p>Secondly, I think that adding the numerators and denominators is not a<br/>useful measure in most cases. There are many details that rules of thumb<br/>ignore. For example, the special case of the harmonic series (especially<br/>given an appropriate musical context). Ratios with powers of two in the<br/>denominator have a special identity to me, and in such a context, 11/8 and<br/>19/16 (also 13/8 and 17/16) have particular sound that &quot;locks in,&quot;<br/>especially with harmonic timbres.</p><p>11/8 is especially a favorite of mine, and I&apos;ve gotten feedback from<br/>musically naive listeners that have commented on its distinctive sound in a<br/>composition. 11/8 and 13/8 in particular is unlikely to be confused with<br/>12TET pitches or their JI counterparts (4/3 and 45/32 in the first case and<br/>8/5 and 5/3 in the second) since they lie close to the midpoint between<br/>those pitches. I&apos;ve come to hear 11/8 as a consonance in many musical<br/>contexts, a wonderfully spicy one, as in the beautiful 8/11/14 chord.</p><p>So I certainly don&apos;t think we can &quot;ignore the accuracy&quot; of these ratios.<br/>It&apos;s possible that 19/16 doesn&apos;t have a special identity to you distinct<br/>from 6/5, but that may not mean that the musical usefulness would be<br/>synonymous or, indeed, that other listeners agree.</p><p>Bill</p><p>^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^<br/>^ Bill Alves                                      email: <a href="mailto:alves@hmc.edu">alves@hmc.edu</a> ^<br/>^ Harvey Mudd College                 URL: <a href="http://www2.hmc.edu/~alves/">http://www2.hmc.edu/~alves/</a> ^<br/>^ 301 E.

I guess it &gt;could be<br/>that the &apos;virtual fundamental&apos; and difference-tone effects of the<br/>16:19:24 otonality have a &gt;strong enough upward &apos;push&apos; to overcome the<br/>downward &apos;pull&apos; of the consonance of the just 5:4 &gt;and 6:5, only 15.6c<br/>away in the 1/6:1/5:1/4 utonality. But in the absence of familiarity<br/>with 12-&gt;tET I doubt it. Any empirical data?</p><p>Actually, yes. There was an experiment (prompted by the Bohlen-Pierce<br/>scale) that tested untrained listeners&apos; responses to three chords:<br/>4:5:6, 3:5:7, and 10:12:15 (=1/6:1/5:1/4). The listeners were asked to<br/>rate 15 different chords, presented in random order. The chords were the<br/>three just ones, and versions where the middle note was detuned -30<br/>cents, -15 cents, +15 cents, and +30 cents. The results found the<br/>listeners dividing into two very clear groups. One group, dubbed &quot;pure&quot;,<br/>clearly preferred the just versions of 4:5:6 and 3:5:7, and gave the<br/>lowest rating to the versions with 30-cent errors. The other group,<br/>dubbed &quot;rich,&quot; liked the +15- and -15-cent-detuned versions of 4:5:6 and<br/>3:5:7 better than the other three versions. Both groups of reponses for<br/>4:5:6 and 3:5:7 were roughly symmerical around zero mistuning. Both<br/>groups, though, preferred the version of 10:12:15 where the middle note<br/>was detuned -15 cents (thus very close to 16:19:24). The write-up<br/>attributes this to the relatively high numbers used in writing 10:12:15,<br/>but goes no further.</p><p>This article appears in the book _Harmony and Tonality_ edited by J.<br/>Sundberg, which I believe was the 1987 proceedings of the Royal Swedish<br/>Academy of Music, Stockholm.

Although the contrast here is certainly that between prime<br/>factorization and factorization in general, I&apos;m not confident enough to<br/>characterize mathematically the ontological status of equalities in<br/>alternative factorings which may arise from this and related factorings,<br/>but the musical utility is clear. For example, Wilson&apos;s most-favored<br/>Eikosany, based on the set where each tone is represented by three factors<br/>out of the set of factors (1,3,7,9,11,15), takes advantage of the presence<br/>of 1 and two composite numbers as independent factors to produce a set with<br/>what I would characterize as a maximum of local melodic resources. By<br/>contrast, all prime factor sets are minimally redundant melodically and<br/>thus less useful in more traditional musical settings.</p><p>Wilson did some interesting work using the vertices of Penrose tilings as<br/>pitches on graphs of tonal space. When 1 and composite numbers were used as<br/>factors, many surprising equalities appeared, creating opportunities for<br/>random walks across the lattice to spontaneously introduce pitch class<br/>repetitions.
