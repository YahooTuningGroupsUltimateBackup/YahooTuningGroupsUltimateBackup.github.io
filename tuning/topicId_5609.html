This diesis is equal to the difference in 1/4-comma<br/>meantone between G# and Ab, for example, and also to the difference<br/>between three pure major thirds at 5:4 and a pure octave at 2:1.[3]</p><p>Such an instrument can provide a gateway to the world of Renaissance<br/>fifthtone music, a style combining the beauty and fluidity of the<br/>16th century with awesome &quot;diesis jumps,&quot; &quot;proximate minor thirds&quot;<br/>near 11:9, and familiar progressions stunningly transformed by<br/>&quot;enharmonic&quot; inflections.</p><p>Whether implemented as a two-manual harpsichord, for example, or as a<br/>digital synthesizer such as the Yahama TX-802 mapping independent<br/>&quot;part-tunings&quot; to two standard MIDI keyboards, our archicembalo can be<br/>used either for playing 16th-century fifthtone pieces, or for new<br/>compositions and improvisations in this kind of style.</p><p>In what follows, I introduce the instrument and its music (Section 1),<br/>and compare it (Section 2) to the larger archicembalo of Vicentino and<br/>the _Sambuca Lincea_ of Fabio Colonna (1618). Then I consider the<br/>&quot;fine structure&quot; of a 24-note meantone tuning and its division of the<br/>tone, suggesting some possible notational conventions (Section 3); and<br/>briefly address issues of &quot;historical tunability&quot; using 16th-century<br/>techniques (Section 4).</p><p>Last but not least (Section 5), I discuss a complication of making do<br/>with only 24 notes which will emerge early in this presentation: the<br/>issue of meantone ranges, retuning between pieces, and transposition,<br/>including an intriguing dilemma in choosing an ideal keyboard<br/>arrangement for pieces such as Vicentino&apos;s _Musica prisca caput_ which<br/>call for a range of Bb-D# plus its counterpart a fifthtone higher.</p><p>---------------------------------------------------<br/>1. Parallel universes: The instrument and its music<br/>---------------------------------------------------</p><p>Taking the lower manual as the &quot;standard&quot; one, we may diagram the<br/>archicembalo as follows, with an asterisk (*) used as an ASCII<br/>equivalent of Vicentino&apos;s dot placed above a note to show its raising<br/>by a diesis or fifthtone. Here the basic meantone gamut is the most<br/>typical Eb-G#:</p><p>      (C#*)                       (F#*)      (G#*)<br/>  C*   Db    D*    Eb*  E*     F*  Gb         Ab     A*    Bb*  B*<br/>----------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>    C#           Eb              F#         G#           Bb<br/>C          D          E      F          G          A          B      C</p><p>In this arrangement, the two manuals represent as it were &quot;parallel<br/>universes,&quot; each a standard 12-note meantone gamut including all of<br/>the usual accidentals called for by the 16th-century system of<br/>modes.[4]</p><p>Since the 128:125 diesis between the two keyboards is precisely equal<br/>to the difference between G#/Ab, etc., some notes of the upper manual<br/>invite two alternate spellings: either Db or C#*, Gb or F#*, Ab or<br/>G#*. Both conventions have 16th-century precedents, and we may choose<br/>either spelling as seems convenient.</p><p>Consider, for example, the following examples using a MIDI-like<br/>notation in which C4 is middle C and higher numbers show higher<br/>octaves:</p><p>Ab4                   E*4        E*4<br/>Eb4                   B*3        B*3<br/>C4                    G#*3       Ab3<br/>Ab3                   E*3   or   E*3</p><p>In the first example, the spelling &quot;Ab3&quot; fits the role of this note as<br/>a concordant fifth below Eb4; in the second example, the spelling<br/>&quot;G#*3&quot; might more clearly convey its role as a concordant major third<br/>above E*3, although using &quot;Ab3&quot; here also may have an advantage of<br/>familiarity and consistency. As it happens, Vicentino&apos;s conventions<br/>in this second case would call for Ab3 and Bertrand&apos;s for G#*3.</p><p>Bertrand&apos;s spelling can be useful in conveying the idea of a sonority<br/>such as E*3-G#*3-B3*-E4* as a counterpart or &quot;twin&quot; to E3-G#3-B3-E4.<br/>Making a &quot;quantum leap&quot; from such one sonority to the other is one<br/>form of what I term a &quot;diesis jump,&quot; as in Vicentino&apos;s complete Latin<br/>secular motet _Musica prisca caput_ from his treatise of 1555[5]:</p><p>E4  E*4<br/>G3  C*4<br/>C4  G*3<br/>C3  C*3</p><p>Aside from the voice-crossing, not in evidence if one plays this<br/>progression on a keyboard instrument, we have two versions of the same<br/>sonority a diesis or fifthtone apart. On our keyboard, we negotiate<br/>this &quot;diesis shift&quot; by jumping from the lower manual to the same notes<br/>on the upper manual.</p><p>Such leaps or shifts also occur in the opposite direction from the<br/>&quot;alternate&quot; to the &quot;normal&quot; 12-note universe, as in Bertrand&apos;s single<br/>known &quot;enharmonic&quot; or fifthtone piece, _Ie suis tellement amoureux_<br/>from his chanson collection of 1578[6]:</p><p>F*4   Bb4<br/>Bb*3  F4<br/>D*4   D4<br/>Bb*2  Bb2</p><p>Both examples feature parallel tenths by enharmonic inflections in two<br/>voices (the outer pair in the first example, here the lowest pair) --<br/>as well as melodic motions by what Vicentino calls &quot;proximate&quot; fourths<br/>or fifths a diesis wider or narrower than the usual intervals.</p><p>An example of a four-voice enharmonic cadence from Vicentino&apos;s<br/>treatise demonstrates another aspect of fifthtone music, the<br/>availability of new vertical intervals such as the &quot;proximate minor<br/>third&quot; which Vicentino describes as having a ratio of roughly<br/>5-1/2:4-1/2 (i.e. 11:9). Here the symbol &quot;r&quot; shows a rest[7]:</p><p>1   &amp;   2     | 1    2    | 1<br/>C4      C[*]4   C4<br/>Ab3     G*3     Ab3  Ab*3   A3<br/>F3      C*3     F3<br/>r   F3  E*3     F3</p><p>In addition to the inflected melodic intervals, we have motion of the<br/>alto in the last part of the cadence from the minor third Ab3 above F3<br/>through the &quot;proximate minor third&quot; Ab*3 (a diesis wider than a minor<br/>third) to the major third A3. Vicentino regards this middle interval<br/>as relatively concordant, having a quality somewhere between that of<br/>the minor and major third[8].</p><p>This example illustrates the problem of meantone ranges already<br/>mentioned: it calls for a tuning based on Ab-C#, with this 12-note<br/>range for the lower manual and Ab*-Db (=Ab*-C#*) for the upper manual,<br/>rather than our tuning of Eb-G# and Eb*-Ab (=Eb*-G#*) shown at the<br/>beginning of this section. To change tunings, we would need to retune<br/>G# on the lower keyboard to Ab, and Ab (=G#*) on the upper keyboard to<br/>Ab*. Alternatively, by transposing Vicentino&apos;s example up a fifth or<br/>down a fourth, we could map it to our original Eb-G#/Eb*-Ab range.<br/>Section 5 discusses such issues in more detail.</p><p>A final example from Bertrand[9] may illustrate a familiar cadence<br/>subtly transformed by the use of altered melodic intervals:</p><p>C5   D[*]5<br/>G4   F#*3<br/>G3   A*3<br/>Eb3  D[*]3</p><p>The brackets show accidentals not in the original which Bertrand _may_<br/>have intended in order to achieve normal vertical fifths and thirds.<br/>If so, the result is a typical Renaissance cadence with downward<br/>semitonal motion in a &quot;Phrygian&quot; fashion -- but with descending<br/>semitones a diesis narrower than usual, and ascending whole-tones a<br/>diesis wider.</p><p>In place of the usual _major_ semitones Eb3-D3 and G4-F#4 (3/5-tone),<br/>we have the minor semitones Eb3-D*3 and G4-F#*4 (2/5-tone); and in<br/>place of the normal whole-tones G3-A3 and C4-D5 (5/5-tone), we have<br/>the large whole-tones G3-A*3 and C5-D*5 (6/5-tone).</p><p>Under this reading, we have a cadence with the accustomed smooth<br/>concords of the Renaissance, but contrasting narrow semitones and<br/>extra-wide whole-tones so as to give the progression a new flavor.<br/>Such is the unique beauty of this music.[10]</p><p>------------------------------------------------<br/>2. Historical comparisons: Vicentino and Colonna<br/>------------------------------------------------</p><p>From an historical perspective, our 24-note archicembalo represents a<br/>subset of the larger archicembalo of Nicola Vicentino (1555) or the<br/>_Sambuca Lincea_ (1618) of Fabio Colonna (c. 1567-1640), the latter<br/>design also being claimed by Scipione Stella (c. 1558 or 1559-1622) as<br/>borrowed from his own _pentorgano_[11].</p><p>These instruments implement a complete 31-note division of the octave,<br/>whether taken as the subtly unequal division of 1/4-comma meantone or<br/>the precise symmetry of 31-tone equal temperament (31-tet).</p><p>Vicentino&apos;s archicembalo has two manuals with six ranks, the first<br/>five ranks dividing the octave into 31 dieses or fifthtones, and the<br/>sixth rank apparently providing pure rather than meantone fifths for a<br/>few frequently used sonorities. Here an asterisk (*) shows notes<br/>raised by a diesis, while an apostrophe (&apos;) shows notes raised by a<br/>&quot;comma,&quot; a term which in Vicentino may mean the amount by which the<br/>fifth is tempered in meantone (~5.38 cents in a 1/4-comma tuning):</p><p>Rank 6:      D&apos;    E&apos;         G&apos;    A&apos;   B&apos;<br/>Rank 5:     Db*   Eb*       Gb*   Ab*   Bb*<br/>Rank 4:  C*    D*    E*  F*    G*    A*    B*  C*     Manual 2<br/>----------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>Rank 3:    Db   D#    E#   Gb    Ab   A#    B#        Manual 1<br/>Rank 2:   C#     Eb       F#    G#     Bb<br/>Rank 1: C     D     E   F     G     A     B   C</p><p>The first two ranks, as Vicentino notes, are tuned as on usual<br/>keyboard instruments, and provide a typical Eb-G# meantone range. The<br/>third rank supplies seven &quot;unusual&quot; accidentals, three flats and four<br/>sharps. Taken alone, the first manual could serve as a 19-note<br/>&quot;chromatic harpsichord&quot; of a kind described by 16th-century theorists<br/>and favored in some parts of Italy (e.g. Naples) around 1600.[12]</p><p>The fourth rank is tuned like the first, but a diesis higher; the<br/>fifth rank supplies the remaining enharmonic accidentals needed to<br/>complete the 31-note division of the octave.</p><p>The &quot;comma keys&quot; of the sixth rank, under the interpretation proposed<br/>above, provide certain sonorities with just 3:2 fifths and 6:5 minor<br/>thirds as well as 5:4 major thirds (e.g. C3-E3-G&apos;3; G3-B3-D&apos;4).[13]</p><p>While Vicentino&apos;s keyboard provides a fully circulating temperament of<br/>31 notes, the 16th-century fifthtone compositions of Vicentino and<br/>Bertrand use no more than 24 notes each, and 26 notes in all. Absent<br/>from these pieces are the three extreme sharps of Vicentino&apos;s third<br/>rank (A#, E#, B#), and two enharmonic accidentals of the fifth rank<br/>(Gb*, Db*).</p><p>In 1618, Colonna uses a different design for his Sambuca Lincea,<br/>_sambuca_ being a kind of ancient Greek triangular harp which a<br/>harpsichord might resemble, and the adjective _Lincea_ or &quot;Lynxian&quot;<br/>likely referring to the Accademia dei Lincei of which he was a member<br/>(along with such colleagues as Galileo Galilei).[14]</p><p>Further, he includes in his treatise an &quot;example of circulation&quot;: a<br/>composition cadencing on all 31 steps of the instrument in a series of<br/>descending fifths or ascending fourths, and &quot;returning on the 32rd<br/>repetition&quot; to where it commenced, the first and final cadences<br/>setting a mode of C Ionian.[15]</p><p>Seeking a systematic organization for his keyboard, Colonna has six<br/>ranks of keys, each tuned 1/5-tone higher than the last, with some of<br/>the 31 notes per octave duplicated to permit easier fingering. Here I<br/>use the letter &quot;h&quot; (the German notation for B-natural) to show his use<br/>of a natural sign for a note raised by 4/5-tone[16]:</p><p>Rank 6:       D    E    F# G    A    B    C# D    (+5/5)<br/>Rank 5:      Ch   Dh   Eh Fh   Gh   Ah   Bh Ch    (+4/5)<br/>Rank 4:     Db   Eb   F  Gb   Ab   Bb   C  Db     (+3/5)<br/>Rank 3:    C#   D#   E# F#   G#   A#   B# C#      (+2/5)<br/>Rank 2:   C*   D*   E* F*   G*   A*   B* C*       (+1/5)<br/>Rank 1:  C    D    E  F    G    A    B  C            (0)</p><p>Barbour[17] compares this radical scheme to the &quot;generalized<br/>keyboards&quot; of the 19th-century theorist Bosanquet and followers.</p><p>In contrast, Vicentino&apos;s archicembalo is an outgrowth of the usual<br/>12-note meantone keyboard (Eb-G#) making up its first two ranks; the<br/>third rank mixes &quot;unusual&quot; flats and sharps (e.g. Ab and A#) in a<br/>pattern similar to that found on more modest Renaissance keyboards<br/>with split accidentals (e.g. G#/Ab and Bb/A#, with the &quot;unusual&quot; note<br/>in back). The second or enharmonic manual is somewhat more systematic:<br/>the seven notes of the fourth rank are a diesis above those of the<br/>first, while the accidentals of the fifth rank can each be seen as a<br/>4/5-tone division of one of the five whole-tones in a diatonic octave<br/>(C-Db*-D, D-Eb*-E, F-Gb*-G, G-Ab*-A, A-Bb*-B).</p><p>Our 24-note instrument combines Vicentino&apos;s approach of making the<br/>first two ranks of his archicembalo identical to those of a standard<br/>12-note meantone keyboard, and Colonna&apos;s approach (borrowed from<br/>Stella?) of having the ranks of his Sambuca Lincea systematically<br/>arranged in spacings of 1/5-tone. The following diagram may illustrate<br/>these points, while mapping the five accidentals of the second manual<br/>to their ranks on Vicentino&apos;s instrument:</p><p>           V.3    V.5      V.3   V.3    V.5<br/>Rank 4:    Db     Eb*      Gb    Ab     Bb*          (Rank 2 +1/5)<br/>Rank 3:  C*    D*    E*  F*    G*    A*    B*  C*    (Rank 1 +1/5) = V.4<br/>------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>Rank 2:   C#     Eb       F#    G#     Bb                          = V.2<br/>Rank 1: C     D     E   F     G     A     B   C                    = V.1</p><p>Most respectfully,</p><p>Margo Schulter<br/><a href="mailto:mschulter@value.net">mschulter@value.net</a></p></div>
