Kemal Karaosmanoglu</p><p>^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^<br/>[Post from Gunther requesting information on accidentals used in<br/>Turkish music]</p><p>Dear all,<br/>The Turkish Makams can be read with western notation. However, there<br/>are different systems (Arel-Ezgi, Yekta Bey, Karadeniz). The second<br/>problem is that these systems have different and theoretical non-<br/>compatible accidentals (flats and sharps). The third problem is, that<br/>these accidentals are not always what they pretend to be (a 1 comma<br/>flat written accidental from the Arel-Ezgi system - 1,4,5,8,9 comma<br/>accidentals - can be 2 comma&apos;s or more or something in between). The<br/>accidentals are very usefull for didactical purposes, but can be<br/>quite inaccurate in describing the exact frequencies that are played.<br/>What I&apos;d like to know, is how much deviation is allowed for the<br/>accidentals, and in what cases. In many Turkish melodies, intervals<br/>of about 150 cents (not the turkish cent, 1200 cents = the octave)<br/>can be heard. In music notation, it is sometimes inpossible (unless<br/>you know how the melodies should sound) to derive the correct<br/>intervals from a written sheet with sharps and flats.<br/>Musical practice and theory are not always very good friends.<br/>Improvisatory talent and the mood of the player is very difficultly<br/>translatable in a theoretical system.<br/>However, I&apos;d want to refret my guitar into 29-tone equal temperament,<br/>and before i decide to do this, I have to know wheter the<br/>approximation is too coarse (in theory it is) or not. If it is too<br/>coarse, I have to know what deviations are allowed in practice, and<br/>when exactly they occur.<br/>If there were a notation system that describes the musical practice<br/>accarate up to the comma (and that means including 6 and 7 comma<br/>intervals if they occur IN PRACTICE), then if anybody has this<br/>information, I would be enormously pleased with that.<br/>The odds are great that only a decent book can solve my curiousness<br/>and the practical fretting problem I&apos;m having. I do not understand<br/>sufficiently Turkish however, that will of course be a disadvantage.<br/>If there&apos;s good material in English, please let me know.<br/>Many thanks in advance,<br/>Gunther<br/>^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^<br/>[My response to the post copied above]</p><p>Hello Gunther,</p><p>I&apos;m pleased to hear about your interest in Turkish music. I would<br/>like to respond to some of your questions, if I may.</p><p>We need to add a &quot;fourth&quot; notation system to the ones you have<br/>mentioned in your post, namely the notation used in Turkish Folk<br/>music, since it uses some different accidentals. The western staff<br/>notation is slightly modified by inserting superscripts to indicate<br/>deviations, in terms of commas, from the &quot;anchor&quot; note. For example,<br/>the superscript &quot;b2&quot; indicates a 2 comma flat, #3 indicates a 3 comma<br/>sharp, and etc. However, such accidentals do not, in general,<br/>represent the &quot;exact&quot; pitch values. Nevertheless, they are more<br/>accurate than others.</p><p>Unfortunately there aren&apos;t any distinct rules for the Arel-Ezgi<br/>notation concerning deviation limits in various cases. Sheet music<br/>represents only a very crude &quot;road map&quot; for the &quot;flow&quot; of the melody<br/>line. Despite these disadvantages, the said system is currently being<br/>used in most conservatories of Turkish music in Turkey.</p><p>You are right about Turkish music intervals; there are some ancient<br/>Turkish music theory books, which do mention ratios such as 12/11<br/>(150.64 cents). However, the theories constructed in these books are<br/>based on the Pythagorian 3-limit system. As you probably know, there<br/>aren&apos;t any quarter tones in the Pythagorian system. In addition, such<br/>ancient references point out significant variations between<br/>theoretical models and practice.</p><p>53t-ET (53-tone Equal Temperament) is a common approximation in<br/>Turkish music. Commas mentioned above are 23.46 cents. We in &Ccedil;iragan<br/>Musiki Dernegi (&Ccedil;iragan Turkish Music Society) believe that classical<br/>Turkish music and Turkish folk music both use the same system, i.e.<br/>same sounds, rythms, maqams, and etc. On the other hand, we&apos;ve had<br/>our share of the very same problems you have mentioned about<br/>accidentals, etc. Therefore, we decided to combine these two systems<br/>of notation as follows: Arel-Ezgi notation is used commonly for<br/>classical Turkish music, supplemented by folk music notation for more<br/>accuracy. The result is, we show pitches which fit Arel-Ezgi systems&apos;<br/>notes with common classical Turkish music notation and the others<br/>with Turkish folk music&apos;s.</p><p>You can find many examples of the notation described here at the<br/>address <a href="http://www.musiki.org">www.musiki.org</a>. We also included a MIDI sound file for almost<br/>all of the written sheets for audio enhancement of the scores. I<br/>recommend especially Ussak (<a href="http://www.musiki.org/ussak.htm">www.musiki.org/ussak.htm</a>) which uses<br/>Si^b2, H&uuml;zzam (<a href="http://www.musiki.org/huzzam.htm">www.musiki.org/huzzam.htm</a>) which uses Mi^b2 and Sab&acirc;<br/>pages (<a href="http://www.musiki.org/saba.htm">www.musiki.org/saba.htm</a>) using Do^#6-7 (Re^b2-3).</p><p>In fact almost all compositions in Turkish music have modulations.<br/>So, all scores and the MIDI examples might be of interest to you.<br/>These examples come from our printed books and accompanying audio<br/>CD&apos;s. So far we have 24 books and CD&apos;s published (Selections From<br/>various Maqams). All books are 32 pages in length and include<br/>Peshrevs, Sharkis, Sazsemais, and etc.<br/>Best regards,</p><p>M.
