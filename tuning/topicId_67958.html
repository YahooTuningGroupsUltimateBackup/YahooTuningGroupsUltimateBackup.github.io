Its idiotic claim, that emotion<br/>   is a better guide, is most alluring to an intelligent audience.<br/>   Intelligent people are often afraid of being thought rather<br/>   cold because they use reason so much. They do not want to appear<br/>   to be emotionally deficient, and are easy prey to a speaker<br/>   who assures them that they are just as sensitive, loving<br/>   and compassionate as the next person, who is also a bit of a<br/>   bore. This permits them the delusion that they are welcome into<br/>   the common fold, instead of remaining aloof from it. They happily<br/>   abandon reason as the price of their admission ticket to the<br/>   human race.</p><p>   An individual can be ensnared with sentimens, and led to drop<br/>   a carefully thought-out position after being assured that he or<br/>   she cares just as much about humanity as the rest of us. A denial<br/>   would hardly count as a good response. A crowd is even easier<br/>   to lead by the nose on a sentimental string. I have rarely seen<br/>   an international gathering which did not give a standing ovation<br/>   to any gaga idiot who urged them to forget reason and<br/>   concentrate on loving each other.&quot;</p><p>   From: Madsen Pirie: &quot;How to Win Every Argument: The Use and<br/>   Abuse of Logic&quot; ISBN: 0826490069</p><p>&gt; based on the plentitude of such writers.

Closest might have been Neidhardt, but even that connection is<br/>also not strong enough and the famous quote from after Bach&apos;s death by<br/>his son-in-law Altnickol (about the temperament of the<br/>Hildebrandt-organ in Naumburg, St. Wenzel) allows such a broad margin<br/>of interpretations  that it can&apos;t pass mere speculation.</p><p>Until today there is not a single piece of evidence, that allows us to<br/>state which temperament Bach might have preferred at any time.
