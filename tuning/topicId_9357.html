He does have a wonderful ear. I<br/>&gt; believe, however, that it is not uncommon for humans to develop musical ears<br/>&gt; that rival electronic tuners, particularly in regard to tuning a pentatonic<br/>&gt; instrument.</p><p>I will totally agree with this and have seen indian musicians have astonishing<br/>pitch perception, not limited to pentatonic either.  On the other hand, as I<br/>pointed out that older measurements of scales in Africa point toward scales<br/>developed in other directions. That the assumption that if a person was<br/>sensitive to acoustic relationships they would tune to simple ratios is a<br/>cultural bias. For one thing for an outdoor instrument, these simple ratios<br/>would be softer, which if one wanted to be heard might not be ideal. Also the<br/>slight controlled beating of intervals (something I love) might be of musical<br/>value to these people. As something that is little explored in western music ,<br/>this acoustic phenomenon might be overlooked to our own insensitivity<br/>    Even though one finds intervals at time close to 4/3s and 3/2s in their<br/>scales, one has to acknowledge their deliberate avoidance of them in other<br/>parts of the same series. The understanding of these I do not believe is found<br/>in the idea that our standards are universal. That our music developed along<br/>the lines it did because of the early discovery of its relationships with<br/>numbers, might have caused us to tune a deaf ear to those phenomenon that have<br/>a relationship different from our historical numerical applications.</p><p>&gt; Paul&apos;s question regarding whether his instrument was close to<br/>&gt; Pythagorean tuning was very appropriate to this point. Pentatonic music<br/>&gt; systems are so universal among primitive cultures that one must consider the<br/>&gt; likelihood that these arise out of aural sensitivity to acoustic<br/>&gt; relationships.</p><p>I could venture to say that the pythagorean pentatonic is not the universal<br/>form nor is the pentatonic of whole tones and minor thirds. There are those<br/>animals like Pelog, slendro with versions of LLSLS intervals, and subharmonic<br/>flutes with pentatonic scales that are as bountiful.</p><p>-- Kraig Grady<br/>North American Embassy of Anaphoria island<br/><a href="http://www.anaphoria.com">www.anaphoria.com</a></p></div><h3><a id=9368 href="#9368">ðŸ”—</a>Paul H.

This<br/>view is supported by Andrew Tracy as well as others. Even many of the tribes<br/>say that this is what they are trying to do. When measured (see Hugh Tracy&apos;s<br/>book on the chopi for example) the measurement do not uphold this except by the<br/>wildest of imagination. In fact Mavila which is considered the best tuning of<br/>the Chopi by the Chopi is the tuning that is the farthest from 7 Et out of all<br/>the Chopi tunings. Possibly Equal means something to them maybe equal as<br/>function. To imply that they do not know or can hear the difference i find<br/>Racist in implication. Among the Chopi they can tune by ear there base pitch<br/>without and reference a &quot;tonic&quot; base pitch of 260. This shows that they are<br/>tuning exactly  the pitches that they hear. The same situation hold true in<br/>Indonesia. Out of coincidence I can find Burmese Harp Music that resembles<br/>Chopi tunings closer than either one resembles 7 ET.</p><p>&quot;Paul H.
