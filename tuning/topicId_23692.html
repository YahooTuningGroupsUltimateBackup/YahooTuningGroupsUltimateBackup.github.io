They&apos;re only in town (Boston) for a few days of<br/>rehearsals before concerts on the weekend when they&apos;ll be premiering<br/>eight new pieces -- it wasn&apos;t going to be possible, given time<br/>constraints, to have them sing in an unfamiliar tuning system, so the<br/>piece I wrote for them is &quot;in 12-tet&quot;. Still, it&apos;s been a real ear-opener<br/>to listen to them discussing tuning in rehearsals - they are very<br/>conscious of who is tuned with who, when it gets impossible to tune<br/>everyone to everyone else.</p><p>For instance, here&apos;s a simplified version of a little four-part snippet<br/>they were doing today (fixed-width font):</p><p>counter-tenor:  A#--------C#-------D#------  (starts above mid-C, goes up)</p><p>tenor 1:              F#-------E-----------  (starts above middle C)</p><p>tenor 2:        B---------A#---B#----------  (starts just below middle C)</p><p>baritone:             E------------F#--G#--  (starts below middle C)</p><p>The first tenor, Rogers Covey-Crump, demonstrated the difference between<br/>singing his E &quot;as written&quot;, tuned 2:1 to the bass, or as a D-double-sharp,<br/>tuned a major third above the B#--which is the leading-tone to ^6, so<br/>25:16 above the tonic--making the Dx a 125:64 above E (the cumulative<br/>ratios are mine not his). He was able, in that context, to move exactly<br/>(or as close as I could tell) the distance of the 128:125 comma, and it<br/>made a big difference as the interval between the two tenors suddenly<br/>locked in like that. When I was writing, it was very hard to decide on the<br/>spelling for passages like this--there are lots of things to juggle, as<br/>you&apos;ll see if you try to figure out a tuning for the above. I wonder if<br/>anyone else has thoughts on spelling considerations in the horizontal<br/>versus vertical dimensions, in those situations when you&apos;re lucky enough<br/>to have singers who are very sensitive to what the notation suggests,<br/>tuning-wise...</p><p>If anyone on the list in the Boston area would like to hear the Hilliards,<br/>I can leave a ticket at the desk for you. They&apos;re performing Friday<br/>evening at 8, at Paine Hall on the Harvard campus, and it&apos;s free (but you<br/>need a ticket ahead of time in case it&apos;s &quot;sold out&quot;) -- how often do you<br/>get to hear the Hilliard ensemble for free? They&apos;re doing old and new<br/>music, and there&apos;s a second, different program on Saturday evening. If<br/>you&apos;re interested drop me a line at this address (spelled out in words so<br/>yahoo doesn&apos;t munge it):</p><p>wild at fas dot harvard dot edu</p><p>--<br/>jon</p></div><h3>Paul Erlich &#x3C;paul@stretch-music.com&#x3E;</h3><span>5/23/2001 9:25:21 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In tuning@y..., jon wild &lt;wild@f...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; The first tenor, Rogers Covey-Crump, demonstrated the difference between<br/>&gt; singing his E &quot;as written&quot;, tuned 2:1 to the bass, or as a D-double-sharp,<br/>&gt; tuned a major third above the B#--which is the leading-tone to ^6, so<br/>&gt; 25:16 above the tonic</p><p>How can you be sure of this? 25:16 is not a ratio you can &quot;lock in&quot; -- it&apos;s too complex.
