This bass was fretted to<br/>&gt; &gt; 12th root of two. Back home I transferred the recording to my<br/>&gt; &gt; digital audio workstation then used it to find the exact frequency<br/>&gt; &gt; of the 24 notes. I then calculated the error between the expected<br/>&gt; &gt; frequency (given the fret placing) and the actual frequency (due to<br/>&gt; &gt; increased string tension).<br/>&gt;<br/>My post above prompted some questions from Glen Peterson. Before I answer them,<br/>let me provide a few details on my experiment.</p><p>I did all my tuning error calculations in hertz in reference to A=55 Hz (the<br/>open A string). Digidesign&apos;s DINR-Hum removal plugin was used to identify the<br/>fundamental of each note. Microsoft Excel did my calculations, but I used the<br/>computer pool at uni so my files were saved to floppy. These files went to data<br/>heaven when my proper uni work required the disk space, but I do still have the<br/>spreadsheet printout that I faxed to the luthier. It has 39 string lengths<br/>(from the 19th root of two), 38 adjustments in millimetres (to compensate for<br/>string tension), and the resulting 38 distances from the nut that the luthier<br/>needed.</p><p>The bridge of the 865 mm scale bass tested, although appearing perfectly set up<br/>according to the electronic tuner at the shop, was actually 3.849 cents out at<br/>the octave fret. (It was one of those &quot;light chaser&quot; style meters as opposed to<br/>a moving needle.) This resulted in my 19th fret being shifted 0.9626 mm toward<br/>the nut.</p><p>Anyway, on to Glen&apos;s questions:</p><p>How much error was there in cents and millimeters of fret placement?<br/>Judging by the excel printout I have, my first fret was adjusted by 2.9143 mm.<br/>This suggests that simply using 2^1/19 would have made it 6.04 cents sharp. At<br/>the 38th fret, an adjustment of 2.3803 mm was required, compensating for an<br/>error of 18.95 cents. The smallest adjustment was 0.2357 mm at the 9th fret for<br/>0.65 cents.</p><p>How did the 19 tone bass come out?<br/>Excellent! Brian West of Fretco in Adelaide, South Australia did a fine job.</p><p>What was the accuracy?<br/>Never measured it, but I hear no difference between it and my 19-tet synth. My<br/>mass produced 12-tet bass on the other hand, while sounding perfect around the<br/>12th fret and also around the 4th, is flatter than a synth between those frets<br/>and sharper elsewhere. (That is what actually prompted the whole exercise.)<br/>Note that the 12-tet bass sounds perfect on its own, probably because when<br/>playing in any one general area of the neck similar amounts of string tension<br/>are applied to each note; it only sounded wrong compared to 12-tet synths.</p><p>What did the luthier have to change to make it more accurate?<br/>Nothing. I just faxed him the measurements.</p><p>DARREN McDOUGALL</p></div><h3><a id=5405 href="#5405">ðŸ”—</a>Glen Peterson &#x3C;Glen@xxxxxxxxxxxxx.xxxx&#x3E;</h3><span>10/11/1999 6:59:40 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Thank you for the data!</p><p>So what you are saying is that your 12tet bass and the one in the store were<br/>about 3-5 cents sharp at the first fret, became flatter until they were in<br/>tune around the fourth fret, continued to flatten for a few frets, then<br/>sharpened back into tune by the 12th fret?  (9th fret in the case of the<br/>store bass).</p><p>Relying on my ears and a guitar tuner, I have come to a similar conclusion<br/>about most guitars that I work on.  You can correct it as you did by<br/>modifying the fret placement (and congratulations on getting the math<br/>right!).  You could also correct it by moving the nut forward a millimeter<br/>or two, then setting the intonation at the 12th fret.  You stretch the<br/>string a little extra when you fret it near the nut, and that is not<br/>compensated for on most guitars.  I&apos;ve done this to a few inexpensive<br/>guitars, and it seemed to really help.  It&apos;s nice to read the results of a<br/>(somewhat) scientific analysis that confirms my suspicions.  There&apos;s a<br/>fellow named Buzz who I think has a patent on this technique.  (really!)  He<br/>put out a video demonstrating the wonders of his new fretting system.  He<br/>never said how it worked, but it wasn&apos;t that hard to figure out that he&apos;d<br/>just slid the nut forward a millimeter or two.</p><p>P.S.  I recently read an article about repair-people NOT adjusting the<br/>intonation on vintage acoustic instruments because it would ruin their<br/>value.  Keep that in mind before you &quot;fix&quot; the nut on your pre-war Martin.</p><p>---<br/>Glen Peterson<br/>Peterson Stringed Instruments<br/>30 Elm Street North Andover, MA 01845<br/>(978) 975-1527<br/><a href="http://www.organicdesign.org/peterson">http://www.organicdesign.org/peterson</a></p></div><h3><a id=5418 href="#5418">ðŸ”—</a>McDougall, Darren Scott - MCDDS001 &#x3C;MCDDS001@xxxxxxxx.xxxxx.xxx.xxx&#x3E;</h3><span>10/12/1999 4:45:13 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>&gt; So what you are saying is that your 12tet bass and the one in the store were<br/>&gt; about 3-5 cents sharp at the first fret, became flatter until they were in<br/>&gt; tune around the fourth fret, continued to flatten for a few frets, then<br/>&gt; sharpened back into tune by the 12th fret?<br/>&gt;<br/>Yes.

Fretboard radius (flatter = better, shred machines are 16&quot;)</p><p>If I&apos;m not mistaken, classical guitars have a flat or slightly concave<br/>fretboard (along the frets). Paul Gilbert&apos;s was flat, but many pros go for<br/>the compound radius.</p><p>&gt;2. String Gauge (.009s seem to be the norm, but people do use .008s, etc.,<br/>&gt;   Plus see no. 3)</p><p>&gt;3. Tuning : is the instrument tuned to std. E, or down a half-step like<br/>&gt;   many well know players, or even down a whole step to D.</p><p>If you&apos;re looking for a smooth, buzz-free sound (I am), I&apos;d recommend .010s<br/>or heavier. My Martin only sounds good with .013s. A lot of players (like<br/>Tony Iommi and Wes Borland) tune down to C#. If using light or de-tuned<br/>strings, tuning problems are easily encountered because a slight bit of<br/>extra finger pressure in any of the three dimensions will produce a<br/>noticeable change in pitch, and buzz often occurs because one picks harder<br/>to compensate for the loss in volume and sustain.</p><p>&gt;4. The... what&apos;s it called... neck relief ? i.e. the (always ?) necessary<br/>&gt;   warp in the neck, unless it&apos;s a graphite/composite neck.</p><p>You&apos;ll usually be able to adjust the truss rod to get the desired very tiny<br/>concavity (along the strings), although I had to get the neck heated after<br/>having a microtonal fingerboard put in, because even with the truss rod<br/>completely loose, it was convex. By the way, a completely loose truss rod<br/>totally changes the sound of the guitar -- the low notes could be described<br/>as &quot;buzzy&quot;.</p><p>&gt;5. The pick &amp; picking technique. Nice stiff, sharp, &amp; smooth ones work<br/>best.<br/>&gt;   I use the 3.0mm Jazz style Dunlop Stubbys.</p><p>&gt;   I gave up my shredder aspirations long before I got a bit tired<br/>&gt;   of the music (Yngwie &amp; Vai still rock though !),</p><p>The fastest, smoothest pick for me in my speed-obsessed days was the Jim<br/>Dunlop Nylon 0.88mm (many metallers go for it in much thinner gauges), and I<br/>still use the 1.0mm for acoustic. Now I use Fender Mediums for electric, as<br/>they have more &quot;bite&quot; -- not as easy to play fast, but when you do, every<br/>note is articulated more clearly. I certainly get more buzz with stiffer<br/>picks.</p><p>&gt;6. How precisely the fingers on the fretting hand press down on the<br/>strings.</p><p>Very important -- the pressure problem I already mentioned, and buzz often<br/>comes from being too close to, or too far from, the fret.</p></div><h3><a id=5579 href="#5579">ðŸ”—</a>Glen Peterson &#x3C;Glen@xxxxxxxxxxxxx.xxxx&#x3E;</h3><span>10/18/1999 5:36:34 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>We were talking about compensating the nut on guitars because they tended to<br/>play sharp on the first few frets.

The<br/>low E showed the most distortion: Almost 2 cents sharp at the first fret.  I<br/>also noticed that even lightly plucking the low E sharpened it by 2 cents,<br/>then it would drop quickly to pitch.  The other strings were in-between the<br/>results for the highest and lowest.  I don&apos;t think that the effort required<br/>to compensate the nut for just the low E is really worth it.  2 cents is<br/>within the margin of accuracy for plucking the string!  The other strings<br/>didn&apos;t seem to need it.</p><p>I&apos;ll try an acoustic when I get a chance.  Hard to find one with a perfect<br/>saddle though...
