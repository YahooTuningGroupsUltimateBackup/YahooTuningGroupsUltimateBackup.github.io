This 3-limit system has been extended to 24-pitches by Rauf Yekta a century ago and adopted by Arel-Ezgi in Turkey not much after that. The difference between these are, Yekta started his scale from perde yegah which he notated as D (Re) due to the frequently preferred Mansur Ney producing this pitch (actually the pitch an octave below that written) according to the standard diapason, while Arel-Ezgi used the exact same system, except that they preferred to start with C (Do), which they called Kaba-Chargah. By doing so, they had to redefine the whole system starting from this very tone and consequently they had chosen the Pythagorean diatonic major scale as default, although it was by no means appropriate for Maqam Music at that time.</p><p>Little did any one of them realize that the system of Key Transposition required perde rast, or the first note produced from the second partial of the Ney (since the first harmonic is hard to produce), to be the first degree for the tonality of the entire Maqamat. Therefore, the relative frequency of perde rast should have been accepted as 1/1, which should have been &grave;Do&grave; and notated as C on the staff for all Ahenks just as it was done for Clarinets and Trumpets for centuries.</p><p>They also violated the &grave;sacred&grave; code of the apotome by breaking the chain of fifths that brought forth the sharps (#) and flats (b). Instead of #, the sharps started to get a curious symbol resembling a TV-antenna, which remains as an element of utter consternation.</p><p>Decades ago, due to the standard tuning of the Tanbur and its incorporation in Maqam Music ensembles, the diapason has been transposed up by a perfect fifth to Bolahenk (actually the octave complement of it, which is Nisfiye) instead of Mansur. This was done by denoting 440 Hz as Re instead of the international standard La. The result was that the entire repertory is now sung a fourth lower than written with the same note names! To add insult to injury, this is once more transposed a fourth lower nowadays in order that some may sing from the regularly preferred Kiz Ahenk, as Bolahenk Nisfiye is way too high.</p><p>The pitches of Maqam Music are better understood as pitch-clusters. This has been ascertained by Can Akkoc, Ph. D. in his analyses of the records of Maqam Music masters.</p><p>The Arabs solved the mess by agreeing to a 24-tET, or near 24-tET solution as proposed by Mushaqa (where perde rast is correctly notated) which they may admit is not quite exact.</p><p>Cordially,<br/>Ozan Yarman</p><p>  ----- Original Message -----<br/>  From: Gene Ward Smith<br/>  To: <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a><br/>  Sent: 24 Eyl&uuml;l 2005 Cumartesi 2:52<br/>  Subject: [tuning] Re: Arab tuning</p><p>  --- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;Justin .&quot; &lt;justinasia@y...&gt; wrote:<br/>  &gt;<br/>  &gt; &gt; &gt; Schismatic<br/>  &gt; &gt; &gt; [17] has been suggested as an alternate world<br/>  &gt; &gt; historical path for<br/>  &gt; &gt; &gt; Western harmony,<br/>  &gt; &gt;<br/>  &gt; &gt; It&apos;s also been put forth, essentially, as the<br/>  &gt; &gt; Medieval Arabic tuning<br/>  &gt; &gt; system.<br/>  &gt;<br/>  &gt; What is this tuning?

To my knowledge, fretted instruments like the Tanbur comprise 30-40 pitches out of a possible hundred for Maqam Music. I also believe there are indeed regional instruments in North Africa, Arabian peninsula, North India, etc... which are prepared to playing particular maqams our of possible hundreds.</p><p>Arabs have simplified the whole deal by adopting 24-tET, Turks and Syrians 24-Pythagorean.

In case<br/>&gt; any of you are interested I found a very nce website<br/>&gt; with lots of audio samples of the different scales<br/>&gt; <a href="http://www.maqamworld.com/index.html">http://www.maqamworld.com/index.html</a><br/>&gt; There are so many scales with different tunings that I<br/>&gt; am confused as to how many pitches they might have in<br/>&gt; total. And whether the freted instuments can play<br/>&gt; every note of all the scales or whether there are<br/>&gt; different instruments for the different families of<br/>&gt; scales (maybe regional?) Maybe some of you know the<br/>&gt; answers?<br/>&gt; Best wishes<br/>&gt; Justin.</p><p>Hi Justin (and all),</p><p>You might like...<br/><a href="http://www.oriental-vision.com/realvideo/Adib-ISDN.rm">http://www.oriental-vision.com/realvideo/Adib-ISDN.rm</a></p><p>He&apos;s an ud maker, and, really, I don&apos;t know much about<br/>maqam music, but I have some ud recordings (including<br/>a very nice one by Munir Bashir) and this is some of<br/>the most amazing playing I&apos;ve heard.</p><p>-Carl</p></div><h3><a id=60750 href="#60750">ðŸ”—</a>George D.

George?</p><p>Margo Schulter and I speculated about an alternate historical path<br/>for *western Europe* beginning around the 13th century, but in a<br/>superpythagorean rather than a schismic framework.  Following the<br/>idea that the requirements for effective melody (i.e., small<br/>semitones via wide fifths) might have taken precedence over consonant<br/>harmony (i.e., more consonant triads via narrow fifths), we concluded<br/>that a tempered 6:7:9 would have eventually become the most consonant<br/>tonic triad in a septimal non-5 harmonic system, with 11 (as<br/>6:7:9:11, e.g.) entering the picture as harmonic development<br/>progressed.  This would have resulted in a closed system of either 17<br/>or 22 tones.  In our alternate path we chose 17 over 22 for several<br/>reasons: its melodic properties, a fifth less heavily tempered, our<br/>desire to maintain non-5 harmony, and the possibility of interpreting<br/>neutral intervals as ratios of 13 (as well as 11).  In this there are<br/>striking parallels (as well as notable differences) with the<br/>development of 5-limit harmony in a meantone framework (as explained<br/>in my neo-medieval paper, which should appear some day in<br/>Xenharmonikon 18).    For example, for the 17-division we expressed a<br/>preference for a well-temperament over 17-ET, but had we chosen the<br/>22-division, it would have probably been 22-equal, in which an<br/>interval of 4 degrees is very close to a super-meantone 2nd (midway<br/>between 8:9 and 7:8), making 22 analogous to 31.</p><p>In our private discussion we wondered whether this might have any<br/>relationship to Turkish or Arabic tuning.  Perhaps others would like<br/>to comment.</p><p>--George</p></div>
