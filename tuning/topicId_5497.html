I must, however, take exception with the following:</p><p> &gt;        My point is that a lot of western art music forms started out<br/> &gt;as a dance or popular form, and was then subverted by art musicians<br/> &gt;using these forms as a vehicle for their musical expression.  How many<br/> &gt;people taking piano lessons dutifully plugging away at pieces from<br/> &gt;Anna Magdelena&apos;s Notebook know they&apos;re playing dances these days?<br/> &gt;Many of these forms outlive the dance or folk genre they started from,<br/> &gt;and take on a life of their own, often becoming quite abstracted from<br/> &gt;the originals.  I leave rants about corporeality and musical<br/> &gt;abstraction to the Partch fans.</p><p>Interested Partch correspondents rarely rant. Partch frequently drew on<br/>popular forms, excluded musical abstraction from his work to a very large<br/>degree, and never hoped that his &apos;forms&apos; would be aped by future writers.<br/>The only canons he was concerned with were the ones he constructed himself<br/>- Harmonic Canons. He also, like many here, preferred some composers over<br/>others, even in musics he wasn&apos;t particularly interested in, as opposed to<br/>a blanket condemnation.</p><p>---[Dante Rosati wrote, earlier:<br/> &gt;To write a &quot;symphony&quot; today, and take Beethoven or Sibelius as your<br/> &gt;model, and want to have it performed by the Philharmonic Society of<br/> &gt;Boredomthroughstagnationsville, is to be a wannabe - a wannabe &quot;classical&quot;<br/> &gt;composer. History will have no qualms about assigning this kind of stuff<br/> &gt;to the dustbin.</p><p> From an ad in the New Yorker:<br/>&quot;On the eve of the 21st century, a piece that is symphonic in structure<br/>surely doesn&apos;t have to be written for a 19th century orchestra to qualify<br/>as a symphony.&quot;<br/>-- Joe Jackson, on his newly released album &quot;Symphony No. 1&quot;</p><p>He&apos;s stolen the form, not the medium, so is Joe cool, or does he go to the<br/>dustbin? YMMV...</p><p>---[Carl Lumma wrote:<br/> &gt;It is obvious that score entry programs can do everything that paper can,<br/> &gt;so you&apos;re way off base here.</p><p>Um, Carl, I&apos;ve looked at every notation program of a high-end nature, save<br/>for Sibelius. I still have things, many things, that I can put on paper<br/>that I can&apos;t notate properly (or in a reasonable amount of time) with these<br/>programs. And could we talk about computers saving time in these matters?<br/>The answer: not always, and/or not hardly - take your pick.</p><p>I work in the studios on a regular basis with people preparing parts with<br/>these programs; I have to *perform* off of these parts. Literally 50% of<br/>the time I wish someone had used their head (and a copyist) and done parts<br/>by hand - it is not fun to have a good take ruined by bad parts (which can<br/>happen with hand-copied parts as well; the problem is, EvErYoNe thinks they<br/>can prepare parts with their computer!).</p><p>When the tools are polished and bullet-proof, fine. Don&apos;t just *assume*<br/>they are at that point today...</p><p>---[And lastly, I&apos;d like to publicly thank whatever supernatural forces<br/>steered Mr. Daniel Wolf into/onto this list, years ago. Dan, when you come<br/>out to play, you certainly have great things to say! On the strength of<br/>your knowledge and musicality, I&apos;m excited to find out about Hans Rott --<br/>any suggestions?

He also, like many here, preferred some composers over<br/> &gt;others, even in musics he wasn&apos;t particularly interested in, as opposed to<br/> &gt;a blanket condemnation.</p><p>        Well, my little line at the end of that paragraph is based on<br/>my first, naive pass through the chapter in &quot;Genesis of a Music&quot; where<br/>he talks about corporeal music -- and what isn&apos;t -- and the memory of<br/>at least one person justifying his own musical tastes by reference to<br/>some spectrum of corporeality.  Now, I need to read that chapter again<br/>some day, but I have deep suspicions about anyone who complains about<br/>the excessive abstraction of plainchant.  My own feeling is that the<br/>best musical system has some balance between abstraction and<br/>corporeality.  I&apos;m hoping Partch would agree with me in principle<br/>about this, but that&apos;s not the feeling I got from my first pass<br/>through Genesis.  On the other hand, when you&apos;re trying to make a<br/>point, a manifesto on its own may come off supporting a much stronger<br/>version of the argument than the author intended.</p><p>        Of course, this justification is unnecessary, since that final<br/>line was intened as a friendly joke. :) I&apos;ve not seen anyone here<br/>endorse what I take to be Partch&apos;s strongest statements regarding<br/>corporeality.</p><p>--<br/>wm</p></div><h3><a id=5512 href="#5512">ðŸ”—</a>Carl Lumma &#x3C;clumma@xxx.xxxx&#x3E;</h3><span>10/15/1999 8:07:28 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>[Jon Szanto]<br/>&gt;&gt;It is obvious that score entry programs can do everything that paper can,<br/>&gt;&gt;so you&apos;re way off base here.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;Um, Carl, I&apos;ve looked at every notation program of a high-end nature, save<br/>&gt;for Sibelius.
