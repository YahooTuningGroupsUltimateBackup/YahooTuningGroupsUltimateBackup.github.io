In another 5 years, we will probably see a huge percentage of the public having general multi-touch computers with various capabilities. Then, instead of investing a lot of money in complex hardware that achieves only a single function, there will only be a small cost for very flexible software to run on the thing people already have. When really capable and easy-to-use microtonal software for these things becomes available... well, I&apos;m optimistic about the potential.</p><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;Carl Lumma&quot; &lt;carl@...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; --- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;Kalle Aho&quot; &lt;kalleaho@&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; <a href="http://createdigitalmusic.com/2010/05/15/roger-linn-imagines-a-">http://createdigitalmusic.com/2010/05/15/roger-linn-imagines-a-</a><br/>&gt; &gt; new-multi-touch-instrument-and-help/#more-11033<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Saw that.
