Is<br/>there a rhythmic equivalent to the difference between a just third<br/>(5:4) and a pythagorean third (81:64)--in other words, do our ears<br/>tend to prefer particular rhythmic relationships that are slightly<br/>uneven, not because they are uneven due to human error but actually<br/>because there is a more complicated rhytmic relationship than we tend<br/>to think? It would be fascinating to explore the applications of<br/>alternative tuning systems to rhythms, especially if it results in<br/>rhythms that are truly more &quot;humanized&quot; and more wholesome to listen<br/>to than the computer-happy drum machine rhythms one hears at a rave.</p><p>John N.

Basically, they started by loosening up the rhythms by moving notes away from their quantized values by an arbitrary (and usually alterable) amount. Later, a number of software sequencers (Cakewalk is the first to come to mind) allowed for &quot;groove templates&quot; to be applied to tracks. An easy example would be to have the backbeat be the furthest behind the beat (late to &quot;2&quot; and &quot;4&quot; by some amount of ticks). You could even use the algorithms to analyze tracks done in realtime and not quantized to mimic a groove.</p><p>It&apos;s been done. Maybe you might want to wonder why all those people are dancing *in spite* of the rigidity of the beat. Must feel good to some of them...</p><p>Cheers,<br/>Jon</p><p>&grave;&apos;&grave;&apos;&grave;&apos;&grave;&apos;&grave;&apos;&grave;&apos;&grave;&apos;&grave;&apos;&grave;&apos;&grave;&apos;&grave;&apos;&grave;&apos;&grave;&apos;&grave;&apos;&grave;&apos;&grave;&apos;&grave;&apos;&grave;&apos;&grave;&apos;&grave;&apos;&grave;&apos;&grave;&apos;&grave;&apos;&grave;&apos;&grave;&apos;&grave;<br/>Real Life: Orchestral Percussionist<br/>Web Life: &quot;Corporeal Meadows&quot; - about Harry Partch<br/>                         <a href="http://www.corporeal.com/">http://www.corporeal.com/</a></p></div><h3><a id=17622 href="#17622">ðŸ”—</a>Joseph Pehrson &#x3C;pehrson@pubmedia.com&#x3E;</h3><span>1/17/2001 7:06:57 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@egroups.com">tuning@egroups.com</a>, engell69@g... wrote:</p><p><a href="http://www.egroups.com/message/tuning/17616">http://www.egroups.com/message/tuning/17616</a></p><p>&gt;do our ears tend to prefer particular rhythmic relationships that are<br/>slightly uneven, not because they are uneven due to human error but<br/>actually because there is a more complicated rhytmic relationship than<br/>we tend to think?</p><p>My guess is that it is just due to human error, and there is a human<br/>&quot;empathy&quot; to that kind of thing... leading to the concept of<br/>&quot;humanization...&quot;  (Not that that can&apos;t be done with a complicated<br/>algorithm...)</p><p>Wim Hoogewerf listened to some of my electronic pieces and one of the<br/>things that he &quot;liked&quot; was the fact that the rhythms seemed slightly<br/>&quot;off&quot; or &quot;humanized.&quot;</p><p>Actually, I had just &quot;played them in...&quot; but it seemed to add to the<br/>piece that way...</p><p>________ _____ ____ _<br/>Joseph Pehrson</p></div><h3><a id=17623 href="#17623">ðŸ”—</a>graham@microtonal.co.uk</h3><span>1/17/2001 10:48:00 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Joseph Pehrson wrote:</p><p>&gt; --- In <a href="mailto:tuning@egroups.com">tuning@egroups.com</a>, engell69@g... wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; <a href="http://www.egroups.com/message/tuning/17616">http://www.egroups.com/message/tuning/17616</a><br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;do our ears tend to prefer particular rhythmic relationships that are<br/>&gt; slightly uneven, not because they are uneven due to human error but<br/>&gt; actually because there is a more complicated rhytmic relationship than<br/>&gt; we tend to think?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; My guess is that it is just due to human error, and there is a human<br/>&gt; &quot;empathy&quot; to that kind of thing... leading to the concept of<br/>&gt; &quot;humanization...&quot;  (Not that that can&apos;t be done with a complicated<br/>&gt; algorithm...)</p><p>Well, have a look at this article:</p><p>&lt;<a href="http://www.newscientist.com/features/features_22708.html">http://www.newscientist.com/features/features_22708.html</a>&gt;</p><p>Uneven, but very precise, rhythms.

He &gt;found that the soloists&apos; swing ratios<br/>also dropped as the tempo increased. More surprising was &gt;the fact that the<br/>drummer always played larger swing ratios than the soloist they were playing<br/>&gt;with. Even at slow tempos soloists rarely had swing ratios greater than 2<br/>to 1.</p><p>&gt;The difference helps to explain why a soloist can seem to be so laid back<br/>on a particularly &gt;toe-tapping number. When playing a note that nominally<br/>coincides with the basic quarter-note &gt;beat, the soloist hangs back<br/>slightly. &quot;The delay can be as much as 100 milliseconds at medium &gt;tempo,&quot;<br/>says Friberg.</p><p>&gt;This tendency to hang behind the beat goes back to the musical ancestors of<br/>jazz. In the &gt;introduction to the 1867 book Slave Songs of the United States<br/>Charles Ware, one of the &gt;editors, observed that when they were rowing a<br/>boat, the oars laid down the basic beat for the &gt;slaves&apos; singing. &quot;One<br/>noticeable thing about their boat songs was that they seemed often to be<br/>&gt;sung just a trifle behind time,&quot; he said.</p><p>&gt;Members of the audience synchronise with the band by tapping their feet to<br/>the basic beat. But &gt;musicians have a more subtle strategy. &quot;If you generate<br/>a solo line with a computer and delay &gt;every note relative to the cymbal it<br/>sounds awful,&quot; says Friberg. &quot;The funny thing,&quot; he adds, &gt;&quot;is that there is<br/>a distinctive pattern that most musicians are not aware of. They synchronise<br/>&gt;on the short eighth note.&quot;</p><p>This is related to a common way of playing straight but behind the beat in<br/>jazz that has often been described as playing exaclty 1/6 of a beat late,<br/>and makes the line swing even though it&apos;s played in perfectly even eighths.<br/>The idea is that, if the drummer were swinging in a 2:1 ratio, the short<br/>eighth would be at 2/3 rather than 1/2 way through the beat; 2/3-1/2=1/6, so<br/>a soloist who played straight eighth notes 1/6 of a beat behind would be in<br/>sync with the short eighth note, as Friberg found to be essential.</p></div><h3><a id=17631 href="#17631">ðŸ”—</a>MotoMusic@aol.com</h3><span>1/17/2001 1:38:13 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Many, many pieces of hardware and software have had these elements<br/>incorporated for some time.
