Yes, I&apos;m sure there _is_<br/>gold in them thar hills!  I look forward to you mining that gold and<br/>bringing the results alongside 7-note diatonic music.</p><p>What I &quot;trust&quot; is my visceral reaction to music.  The beauty that brings<br/>me back again and again.  By focusing on the &quot;old&quot;, the diatonic, am I<br/>potentially closing off the chance for exploration in new, exciting,<br/>possibly fruitful alternatives?  Yes, without doubt.  But there is only<br/>one of me, and going after some particular slice of the pie that excites<br/>me is inevitable.</p><p>I&apos;m glad, Dan, that you&apos;re out there finding new possibilities.  You<br/>may be leading the way into a grand and glorious future, in which the<br/>diatonic sound is quaint and archaic.  More power to you!</p><p>For myself, I am very wary of letting the head override the ear.  The<br/>head is, IMHO, what is wrong (to my taste) with the &quot;classical&quot; works<br/>of the 20th century.  If it requires explanation before they play the<br/>music, I know I&apos;m in trouble.</p><p>JdL</p></div><h3>jpehrson@rcn.com</h3><span>6/2/2001 6:40:26 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In tuning@y..., &quot;John A. deLaubenfels&quot; &lt;jdl@a...&gt; wrote:</p><p><a href="http://groups.yahoo.com/group/tuning/message/24268">http://groups.yahoo.com/group/tuning/message/24268</a></p><p>&gt; For myself, I am very wary of letting the head override the ear.<br/>The head is, IMHO, what is wrong (to my taste) with the &quot;classical&quot;<br/>works of the 20th century.

In other words your<br/>intellect, your intuitions and your imagination etc.</p><p>The point being that it is my belief that a lot of tunings and the<br/>like are given up on much to early due to a lot of nonmusical picking<br/>and poking about.</p><p>Tuning examples and tuning theory is all well and fine, but music sets<br/>many moving parts into motion that can&apos;t be so easily anticipated. And<br/>oftentimes these hidden treasures seem to resist any stray resolve --<br/>not that the ears help, as they&apos;re apparently particularly stubborn<br/>when it comes to meaningfully offset consonances!</p><p>--Dan Stearns</p></div>
