That makes at least 4 people working in cacti!<br/>&gt; Was Cage the first, I wonder...<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I&apos;ve heard two different live concerts bmy two<br/>&gt; different dudes that used the &apos;amplifed catus&apos; as an<br/>&gt; instrument. At one concert I asked him some questions<br/>&gt; and he said that the stress of the whole scene kills<br/>&gt; the cactus after a few performances and so he has to<br/>&gt; keep getting new cactuses. He also had some theories<br/>&gt; about the high water content of the cactus interior<br/>&gt; contributing greatly to the sound and such. I don&apos;t<br/>&gt; remember. The concerts were over 10 years ago I think.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Anyway, the article posted is cool since the guy<br/>&gt; records them out in the natural environment and lets<br/>&gt; the rain naturally pluck the cactus instead of plucking<br/>&gt; them himself until it keels over dead. Very respectful;<br/>&gt; very nice.</p><p>Note that Lerman isn&apos;t doing this simply as a musically<br/>creative act.  Part of the reason he&apos;s doing it is because<br/>he actually wants to assemble a &quot;sonic map&quot; of the Sonoran<br/>Desert, which I (as a confirmed &quot;map geek&quot;) think is<br/>*even cooler* than if he had approached this from a<br/>&quot;composer/performance viewpoint&quot;.</p><p>&gt; Anyway one thing I wanted to say about the frog file<br/>&gt; I posted is that our natural environment creates far<br/>&gt; better, more complex, and more interesting microtonal<br/>&gt; music than we do.</p><p>My take on this:  All of human activity exhibits a tendency<br/>to simply, reduce, categorize, etc., in order that we may<br/>comprehend patterns that *we think* exist in nature.</p><p>As mclaren has so violently argued, nature is a whole lot<br/>more complex than any means we have for representing and<br/>understanding it.</p><p>All of these ideas are exactly what lie behind my concept<br/>of &quot;finity&quot;:<br/><a href="http://www.ixpres.com/interval/dict/finity.htm">http://www.ixpres.com/interval/dict/finity.htm</a></p><p>I think that ultimately the simplest way we can comprehend<br/>numerical relationships is to reduce them somehow (meaning<br/>that there may be many different ways of proceeding) to the<br/>prime series and its multiples.</p><p>There seems to me to be something inherently &quot;basic&quot; about<br/>the prime series that helps us to understand anything that<br/>we want to quantify, and that&apos;s all I&apos;m arguing about when<br/>I attempt to defend my theories.</p><p>love / peace / harmony ...</p><p>-monz<br/><a href="http://www.monz.org">http://www.monz.org</a><br/>&quot;All roads lead to n^0&quot;</p><p>_________________________________________________________<br/>Do You Yahoo!?<br/>Get your free @... address at <a href="http://mail.yahoo.com">http://mail.yahoo.com</a></p></div>
