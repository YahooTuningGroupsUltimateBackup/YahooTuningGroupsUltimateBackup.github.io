It&apos;s 385:384,<br/>or about 4.5 cents. Why do I think it&apos;s so special? Because you can<br/>also describe it using exactly one each of 3,5,7 and 11:</p><p>5 * 7 * 11  &quot;=&quot;  3 (modulo several octaves), where &quot;=&quot; means the<br/>approximation is off by 385:384.</p><p>In other words its monzo consists of all 1s and -1s up to the 4th odd<br/>prime, and 0 for every other entry.</p><p>Puzzle: if we consider all the commas whose monzos have uniquely 1s<br/>and -1s after the factors of 2, up to the nth odd prime, how large<br/>does n have to be before you can find a resulting comma that is better<br/>than 385:384?</p><p>(by the way: hi, long-time (since eartha.mills days) on-and-off<br/>reader, don&apos;t think I&apos;ve posted before though.)</p><p>Jeremy Targett</p></div><h3>Gene Ward Smith &#x3C;gwsmith@svpal.org&#x3E;</h3><span>7/25/2005 3:53:29 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, Jeremy Targett &lt;jeremy.targett@g...&gt; wrote:</p><p>&gt; Puzzle: if we consider all the commas whose monzos have uniquely 1s<br/>&gt; and -1s after the factors of 2, up to the nth odd prime, how large<br/>&gt; does n have to be before you can find a resulting comma that is better<br/>&gt; than 385:384?</p><p>715/714 has all prime factors to the +-1 power, *including* 2.</p></div><h3>Gene Ward Smith &#x3C;gwsmith@svpal.org&#x3E;</h3><span>7/25/2005 6:24:16 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;Gene Ward Smith&quot; &lt;gwsmith@s...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt; --- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, Jeremy Targett &lt;jeremy.targett@g...&gt;<br/>wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; Puzzle: if we consider all the commas whose monzos have uniquely 1s<br/>&gt; &gt; and -1s after the factors of 2, up to the nth odd prime, how large<br/>&gt; &gt; does n have to be before you can find a resulting comma that is better<br/>&gt; &gt; than 385:384?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; 715/714 has all prime factors to the +-1 power, *including* 2.</p><p>A property these commas have is that they are what might be called<br/>universal xenharmonic bridges.
