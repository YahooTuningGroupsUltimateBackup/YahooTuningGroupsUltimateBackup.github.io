In my<br/>&gt; opinion<br/>&gt; &gt; 12et C:E:G:Bb desn&apos;t sound like a 4:5:6:7 chord, and your solutions<br/>&gt; are<br/>&gt; &gt; very close to 12et.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; They sounds like non-JI 4:5:6:7s and a bit more &quot;locked&quot; than 12-<br/>&gt; equal. I compared a just 4:5:6:7 chord with its best approximation in<br/>&gt; 12-equal and those two chords definitely have a perceptual<br/>&gt; similarity. The only difference is the phasing, beating and whooshing<br/>&gt; of the 12-equal.
