Kathleen Schlesinger wrote<br/>&gt; a book, _The Greek Aulos_, which Partch admired, but which has<br/>&gt; since been discredited, where she reconstructs ancient scales<br/>&gt; based on measurements of holes in surviving ancient auloi.)</p><p>I only included the bit about Schlesinger&apos;s work having<br/>been discredited because I mentioned her here before and<br/>got that as a response, and just wanted to give a well-<br/>rounded picture this time.</p><p>Kraig Grady had this to say:</p><p>&gt; [Kraig Grady, TD 443.2]<br/>&gt;     I am going to take issue on &quot;The Greek Aulos&quot; its<br/>&gt; supposed discredit involved certain historically details.<br/>&gt; The actual scale measurements has been upheld by  the<br/>&gt; Dionysian woodwind maker, Jim French (dionysian in that<br/>&gt; he is considered one of the best meade makers in the world)<br/>&gt; he makes replica of all types of wind instruments including<br/>&gt; for Pharaoh Sanders. He swears by the book. Erv Wilson also<br/>&gt; has a large collection of South American flutes with equally<br/>&gt; spaced holes which also illustrate these subharmonic flutes<br/>&gt; as well as the tuning of the exit holes to sometimes a 3/2<br/>&gt; below one of the scale degrees. One of these flutes ,a double<br/>&gt; one ,was given to Partch and can be heard in Delusion of the<br/>&gt; Fury. The placing of two subharmonic scales at x interval but<br/>&gt; placed with the thirds &quot;parallel&quot; is a wide open possibility<br/>&gt; for further exploration. I for one have used two a 3/2 a part<br/>&gt; back in my opera &quot;War and Pieces&quot;.<br/>&gt;     Also in this book you find on Page 4,  a crosset of<br/>&gt; harmonic and subharmonic series, ala diamond like. True she<br/>&gt; probably over extends where these scales are actually found.<br/>&gt; But the actual Microtonal material is invaluable.</p><p>I&apos;ve owned Schlesinger&apos;s book for around 8 years, and still<br/>have not digested large chunks of it.  But let me say that<br/>overall I find her theories interesting and stimulating.</p><p>I suppose part of the reason why I&apos;ve speculated with such<br/>boldness on the work of so many past theorists, is my<br/>admiration for both the detail and broad perspective of<br/>Schlesinger&apos;s work.  I agree that it is an invaluable<br/>contribution to the literature.</p><p>Clarifying Aristoxenus&apos;s criticism of _aulos_-based theory:<br/>-----------------------------------------------------------</p><p>The main reason Aristoxenus criticized basing a theory of<br/>&apos;harmonics&apos; on the nature of instruments is that, because<br/>he used geometrical concepts of equal division in his<br/>measurements, he needed to start from a conception of pitch<br/>which was infinitely divisible.</p><p>His mathematics had no way of dealing with roots, powers,<br/>exponents, and the like, and so he conceived of pitch as an<br/>infinite continuum, with no limits on either end in its<br/>intrinsic nature.  The limits perceived by us are imposed by<br/>the human ear-brain system.  And it had to be infinitely<br/>divisible because he had to use geometry to make the divisions<br/>into &apos;1/4-tones&apos;, &apos;1/3-tones&apos;, and &apos;3/8-tones&apos; which appear<br/>in his enharmonic and relaxed and hemiolic chromatic genera,<br/>respectively.</p><p>Basing the divisions on instruments would not work for his<br/>theories, because string-lengths and pipe-holes were measured<br/>in those days generally by making an arithmetical division of<br/>the total length, which of course would give a &apos;subharmonic&apos;<br/>or Utonal (higher-limit) JI scale.</p><p>[Aristoxenus 2.43.1-10; in Barker 1989, p 158]<br/>&gt; Just as there is no attunement in the strings unless someone<br/>&gt; brings it to them by manuual adjustments, no more is there in<br/>&gt; the finger-holes, unless someone brings it to them by manual<br/>&gt; adjustments.  It plainly needs no arguing, since it is obvious,<br/>&gt; that no instrument tunes itself, but that perception is the<br/>&gt; authority in this matter.</p><p>As a matter of fact, I find this to be an argument supporting<br/>Schlesinger&apos;s theories.  The nature of Schlesinger&apos;s &apos;octave-<br/>species&apos; scales was that each successive descending interval<br/>was smaller than the last, because it was an *arithmetic*<br/>division of the pipe-length.</p><p>This wouldn&apos;t work for Aristoxenus, because he conceived his<br/>scales as tetrachordal units, with the same intervals in<br/>one tetrachord replicated in all others.</p><p>Hmm... this is pretty interesting.  I&apos;ll dig more deeply into<br/>this for a future posting.</p><p>Regarding Jim French&apos;s work:<br/>----------------------------</p><p>I was hoping to meet Jim French last year in San Diego.<br/>Jonathan Glasier has some of his &apos;Phrygian Pipes&apos; at the<br/>Sonic Arts Gallery.</p><p>I&apos;m quite interested in French&apos;s work, partly because my<br/>initial experiences in music were as a woodwind player, and<br/>partly because of having read Schlesinger.</p><p>I was hoping to play on them in the improvisations we had,<br/>but I didn&apos;t stick around long enough to master them and<br/>found it quite difficult to produce a good tone on them,<br/>mainly because my woodwind years are way behind me now and<br/>my embouchure is shot.  But Jonathan plays them quite well.</p><p>My upcoming visit to San Diego:<br/>-------------------------------</p><p>For those of you in the Southern California area, I&apos;ll be<br/>spending the New Year holiday and my birthday in San Diego,<br/>and plan to visit Los Angeles too.  I&apos;ll be in California<br/>from December 31 to January 9, and am looking forward to<br/>jamming and talking shop face-to-face.</p><p>Most likely, I&apos;ll be spending quite a bit of time at the<br/>Sonic Arts Gallery.  I already have plans to see Jonathan,<br/>Denny Genovese, and John Chalmers.  Visitors are encouraged<br/>for great musical get-togethers!</p><p>I definitely plan on visiting Anaphoria Island too!</p><p>REFERENCES<br/>----------</p><p>Barker, Andrew.  1989.  _Greek Musical Writings_<br/>   vol 2: &apos;Harmonic and Acoustic Theory&apos;.<br/>   Cambridge University Press, Cambridge.</p><p>Schlesinger, Kathleen.  1939.  _The Greek Aulos_.<br/>   Methuen &amp; Co Ltd, London.<br/>   (I believe this was reprinted around 1970)</p><p>-monz</p><p>Joseph L.
