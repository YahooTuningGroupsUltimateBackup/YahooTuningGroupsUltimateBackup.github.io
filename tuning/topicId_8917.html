I recently bought 4 CD&apos;s of keyboard music by<br/>Froberger, Sweelinck, Gibbons, etc., and the harpsichords and organs<br/>involved are all in beautiful meantone.</p><p>&gt;It&apos;s terrific to think of 31t-ET, a &quot;circulating&quot; or modulating 1/4 comma<br/>&gt;meantone system, as conceivably &quot;supplanting&quot; 12t-ET as a &quot;de facto&quot; system<br/>&gt;for both past and future musics, but is it practical to perform historical<br/>&gt;repertoire on 31-tET keyboards?</p><p>Yes.  I&apos;ve noticed a tendency in this movement to underestimate the human&apos;s<br/>ability to play things.  The keyboard we now use may seem ideal in many<br/>ways, and it may seem easy to justify that impression when you consider the<br/>_amazing_ things that have been played on it, but it really isn&apos;t ideal,<br/>and much of its design can only be attributed to historical accident or the<br/>demands of piano mechanics.  Those things are amazing _because_ they can be<br/>played on it, and there are all sorts of amazing things waiting to be<br/>performed on odd-looking keyboards.</p><p>&gt;Does this involve some kind of &quot;mapping&quot; of pitches where only *some* of<br/>&gt;the 31 pitches are &quot;mapped&quot; onto a 12-note keyboard??... That doesn&apos;t make<br/>&gt;sense, though, since the &quot;normal&quot; 1/4 comma meantone system would already<br/>&gt;do that... (??)</p><p>Yup.  Normal keyboards were played for hundreds of years in this way --<br/>they still are today.</p><p>&gt;If the keyboards are very different from 12 notes per octave, doesn&apos;t that<br/>&gt;jeopardize the frequency of performances... or am I getting this all wrong<br/>&gt;(??)</p><p>Could you clarify your question?</p><p>&gt;Certainly people are not being asked to perform traditional composers like<br/>&gt;Handel on a keyboard with 31 keys... or *ARE* they?? I would expect<br/>&gt;resistance to such a proposal.</p><p>I would never ask anybody to perform something a certain way.  But I would<br/>have no qualms about playing Handel in 31 -- have you heard the famous<br/>story of Handel&apos;s 14/16 note per octave meantone organs?</p><p>-Carl</p></div>
