(I was &gt;really surprised that you  thought my voice was too &quot;gay.&quot;)</p><p>I said:</p><p>&gt;This troubles me greatly, and I&apos;ll say why publicly: I can&apos;t imagine ever &gt;using that phrase in that way, and if I did I&apos;d be both mortally &gt;embarrassed and would excuse myself from the room -- that kind of attitude &gt;is unpardonable, for anyone.</p><p>I searched my archives, and found the lengthy email I sent you on 11/13/97; I am resending a copy to you privately. In the email, there is absolutely no mention whatsoever of that word or phrase, nor even anything remotely implying sentiments  close to it. Or within a country mile of it. I close that email with the statement:</p><p>&quot;So, that&apos;s what struck me. I hope it hasn&apos;t come off harshly, and I&apos;ve tried to at least have a reason for most of it.&quot;</p><p>In my search of my personal email archives, I found a note from you on 12/25/97 with the following:</p><p>&gt;Also thanks for the detailed response on US Highball.  More on that later.<br/>&gt;I will circulate it to the players involved.</p><p>None of the rest of my emails from you mention USH at all, which is why I have stated that you never sent anything. I have a fair number of msgs from you past this date, but you never responded to my detailed &apos;critique&apos; of the recording.</p><p>I took great care listening to your performance and offered informed (I think) and constructive (I hope) criticism. I now would hope you can muster up an apology for attributing to me a slur I would never knowingly utter or write.</p><p>Thanks,<br/>Jon</p><p>P.S. I wonder if it is the same story with your impressions from Danlee...</p><p>&grave;&apos;&grave;&apos;&grave;&apos;&grave;&apos;&grave;&apos;&grave;&apos;&grave;&apos;&grave;&apos;&grave;&apos;&grave;&apos;&grave;&apos;&grave;&apos;&grave;&apos;&grave;&apos;&grave;&apos;&grave;&apos;&grave;&apos;&grave;&apos;&grave;&apos;&grave;&apos;&grave;&apos;&grave;&apos;&grave;&apos;&grave;&apos;&grave;&apos;&grave;<br/>Real Life: Orchestral Percussionist<br/>Web Life: &quot;Corporeal Meadows&quot; - about Harry Partch<br/>                         <a href="http://www.corporeal.com/">http://www.corporeal.com/</a><br/>NOTE:<br/>If your reply bounces, try --&gt; <a href="mailto:jonszanto@yahoo.com">jonszanto@yahoo.com</a></p></div>
