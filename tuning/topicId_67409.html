It lists all sixty, a tiny number<br/>of the intervals are shown as fractions, ratios, but the rest are all show in<br/>cents.  I really need the actual math, fractional ratios for each note. Went through a bunch of the menu options under view, still couldnt get all ratios, any ideas?<br/>Surely the software must have a way to do this?<br/>  Here is how scala is currently showing the scale;<br/>-------------------------------<br/>  0:          1/1               0.000 unison, perfect prime<br/>  1:          3.615 cents       3.615<br/>  2:     531441/524288         23.460 Pythagorean comma, ditonic comma<br/>  3:         46.920 cents      46.920<br/>  4:         70.380 cents      70.380<br/>  5:         93.840 cents      93.840<br/>-------------------------------<br/>  In an letter from Drew, he tells me of a 53 note tuning instrument and lists all the intervals as ratios;<br/>  &quot;Date: Mon, 7 Aug 2006 11:26:08 -0700 (PDT)<br/>From:  &quot;Drew Hempel&quot; &lt;<a href="mailto:druhempel@yahoo.com">druhempel@yahoo.com</a>&gt;<br/>Subject: S 52 -- the new electronic instrument<br/>To: &quot;dar kone&quot; &lt;<a href="mailto:zarkorgon@yahoo.com">zarkorgon@yahoo.com</a>&gt;</p><p>From &quot;A New Electronic Instrument for Musical Research: the S 52&quot; by Alain  Danielou, Claude Cellier, Andre Kudelski in the journal &quot;The World of  Music&quot;, 1981, No. 2, p. 63.  further information see A. Danielou,  Semantique Musicale, Editions Hermann, Paris, 1978    &quot;...the instrument offers a range of eight octaves each of which is  divided into 54 intervals.....  A combination of binary-ternary-quinternary systems of numeration used for  the classification of expressive intervals appeared to be the only way to  explain their significance, their number and its limits.  This theory also  explains the relative intensity of the expressive contents and the  relative importance of the intervals when the component factors evolve  from simple to more complex ratios.&quot;    &quot;Intervals based on a binary system of numeration appear neutral.  The<br/> octave is a typical example... The significance of an interval is  determined by the resulting effect of ternary and quinternary factors....  The intensity of the meaning becomes weaker with the multiplication of the  ternary factor.  In the ascending scale of fifths the expressive character  will be stronger for the first fifth than for the second one.  The  successive intervals determined by a series of fifths have a common  expressive character which becomes gradually weaker in the order: (C) G D  A+ E+ B+.  The fifth degreee is the limit of the analysing mechanism of  the human brain with regard to ternary elements.  For quinternary elements  the second degree is the practical limit although the third degree is  recognizable.  The factor 25 is therefore commonly used while intervals  based on the factor 125 appear somewhat odd....&quot;    &quot;Thus the number 16, in binary 10.000, will be transcribed as B to the  4th; the number 17, written 1.000 in ternary, will be<br/> transcribed as T to  the 3rd; the number 25, written 100 in quinternary, will be transcribed as  Q to the 2nd.  The limma 135/128 = 5 x 27/128 will appear as QT to the  3rd/B to the 7th.&quot;    The expressive value of intervals is determined by the following figures  and their combinations:  Q to the 2nd/ sad, melancholy  Q/ tender, soft  T/ brilliant, sunny, glorious  /T calm, peace, night  /Q agreesive, passionate, erotic  /Q to the 2nd hard, cruel    Thus, with relation to C as tonic:  the harmonic third e (5/4 = Q/B to the  2nd) will be soft, tender; the pythagorean third E+ (81/64 = T to the  4th/B to the 6th), brilliant, radiant.    A (5/3 = Q/T), similar to E but calmer  A+ (27/16 = T to the 3rd/B to the 4th), similar to E+  Ab- (25/16 = Q to the 2nd / B to the 4th), pathetic  Ab (128/81 = B to the 7th/T to the 4th), calm, peaceful  Ab+ (8/5 - B to the 3rd/Q), erotic, enterprising  Db- (25/24 = Q to the second/TB to the 3rd), desperate, pathetic but calm  Db (135/128 =<br/> QT to the 3rd/B to the 7th), tender, confident  Db+ (16/15 = B to the 4th/QT), erotic, loving, calm  Db++ (27/25 = T to the third/Q to the 2nd), harsh, self asserting    &quot;The keyboard covers three octaves with 53 notes in each octave  represented by 53 keys.  A simple device allows to obtain on the same  keyboard higher aor lower octaves so as to cover 8 octaves.    &quot;The diapason can be adjusted so that the instrument may be tuned to the  tonic chosen by the oriental musician of the A of various orchestras.&quot;    &quot;A micro-processor (a kind of micro-computer) incorporated in the  instrument gives it a great adaptability.  It is thus possible to produce  automatically chords of up to 8 notes, the amplitude of its components can  be controlled separately allwing for an additional synthesis fo the  sound-effect desired.&quot;    NUMERATIonfiltered= 1 to 27  Binary = 1 10 11 100 101 110 111 1000 1001 1010 1011 1100 1101 1110 1111  10000 up to 11011  Ternary = 1 2 10 11 12 30 31 33<br/> 100 101 102 120 111 112 120 121 122 200  201 202 210 up to 1000  Quinternary = 1 2 3 4 10 11 12 13 14 20 21 22 23 24 30 31 32 33 34 40 41  42 43 44 100 101 102    The numerical ratios are brought within the same octave;  other octaves  are obtained by mulitplication or divison by the factor B (2).... The  difference between the sounds of the same name found at the ends of the  series is of less than 2 cents (a quarter of a frequency in the middle  octave).  The difference between Bb++ and B-- is of 2 Savarts or 6 cents.
