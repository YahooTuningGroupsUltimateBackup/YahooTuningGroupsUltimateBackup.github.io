Gene, I haven&apos;t had time to listen except for about twice, and they were a tad distracted. My initial impressions were that I liked the first temperment best (I believe it returns?), but maybe it is just a matter of context. I *did*, however, like your first motive very well, and the variations that came to it.</p><p>&gt; Help. As in what sort of gear?</p><p>I won&apos;t jump in too much here. One of the problems is with extended intonations, where you need to access more than 12 steps per octave, our current lineup of hardware/software are still far from ideal. However, there are a good number of people over at MMM that could counsel you well in this area.</p><p>That said, read on...</p><p>&gt; I was thinking if I wanted to be taken seriously I should learn<br/>&gt; how to make microtonal scores that people actually would consider<br/>&gt; playing. How do you do that expeditiously?</p><p>Take this the right way, I hope, as I mean it sincerely! When I listen to music (and I&apos;m speaking only for myself), I do just that: listen to the music - and all that conveys it. I *don&apos;t* listen to simply an intonational scheme, and I don&apos;t listen to a &apos;chord progression&apos; (and similar items). So the actual sound of a piece, the chosen timbres and &apos;orchestration&apos; becomes very bound up in the experience. This is where sound cards can be... difficult.</p><p>I can *hear* the emulations of any number of instruments, and bravo for writing a piece that varies the ensemble, not only for variety but for the differing &apos;moods&apos; of the tuning and harmonies. But as I mentioned (and others, as well) to Joseph on a number of occasions, the sonic limitations of these &apos;emulations&apos; can be, to those who are around fine instrumental sounds on a daily basis, like that of fingernails on a chalkboard.</p><p>Mind you, I&apos;ve written and recorded quite a bit of stuff with sounds that now make me wince in pain - sometimes at the time the sounds were all I had. But at this point in the game, when I start making a piece, and I have a desire to have it heard, I can&apos;t bear to let it go any farther if I don&apos;t find the actual Sound of it compelling as well. It, in my book, can&apos;t end up any less important than interesting harmonic schemes or fetching melodies and motives.</p><p>But it is clear where you are going, and especially if you were to really pinpoint an &apos;orchestration&apos; for a piece - say, a woodwind quintet or something - then you can get your information going as you have, and then find someone with more outboard gear to do a &apos;realization&apos; for you that would come closer to acoustic renditions.</p><p>If that is what you are shooting for, that is.</p><p>But these are all stepwise refinements, and given a choice I&apos;d rather have music that does something that may fall a little short in the sonic category then have someone with racks and racks of great sounding equipment that can&apos;t find a decent phrase with a GPS mapping device. You are already beyond half-way there, and the latter person just has good gear and no clues. Happens all the time, from what I hear.</p><p>That&apos;s all from me, congrats and any follow-ups I can do at MMM...</p><p>Cheers,<br/>Jon</p></div><h3>jpehrson2 &#x3C;jpehrson@rcn.com&#x3E;</h3><span>5/14/2002 11:01:04 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In tuning@y..., &quot;genewardsmith&quot; &lt;genewardsmith@j...&gt; wrote:</p><p><a href="http://groups.yahoo.com/group/tuning/message/36906">http://groups.yahoo.com/group/tuning/message/36906</a></p><p>&gt; --- In tuning@y..., &quot;jpehrson2&quot; &lt;jpehrson@r...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; ***I think Gene could be a serious contender as an &quot;algo-type&quot;<br/>&gt; &gt; composer... well, at least his efforts are more interesting than<br/>a<br/>&gt; &gt; *lot* of the stuff I hear.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; How am I doing as a neo-Renaissance-type composer, do you think?<br/>&gt;</p><p>*** I didn&apos;t realize that was your objective!

That would be a *free* utility.</p><p>The *other* way involves some kind of &quot;rack-mounted&quot; gear which<br/>almost *always* sounds better than software synths, except for CSOUND<br/>and some of the high-end ones (Kyma??).</p><p>Anyway, Jacky Ligon is the &quot;litmus test&quot; for acoustic sound with rack<br/>mounted MIDI stuff.  I would suggest listening to some of his &quot;tunes&quot;<br/>and the obvious question is:  &quot;Why doesn&apos;t *my* stuff sound like<br/>that???&quot;  :)</p><p>It doesn&apos;t involved spending a fortune, and maybe even a<br/>special &quot;high-end&quot; sound card would do the trick, but I really think<br/>you could take some of your &quot;theoretical&quot; ideas to a different<br/>dimension that would make them a little more &quot;authoritative&quot; on the<br/>composing front.</p><p>&gt; I was thinking if I wanted to be taken seriously I should learn how<br/>to make microtonal scores that people actually would consider playing.<br/>&gt; How do you do that expeditiously?<br/>&gt;</p><p>***That&apos;s *another* good question.
