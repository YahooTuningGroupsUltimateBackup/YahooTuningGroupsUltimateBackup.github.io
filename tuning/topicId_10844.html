My only comment is on this:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt;5LJI (5-Limit Just Intonation):<br/>&gt;&gt;The Comma digits used here show the values that the subsequent Meantone<br/>&gt;&gt;Temperament attempts to approximate.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;There is no single 5-limit JI system that meantone attempts to approximate<br/>&gt;-- rather, it approximates a larger set of JI relationships than any single<br/>&gt;JI system could achieve. A reasonable simplification would be that meantone<br/>&gt;simultaneously approximates several JI systems. &quot;Approximation&quot; in this<br/>&gt;sense should be evaluted not on a pitch-by-pitch, but on a consonant<br/>&gt;interval-by-consonant interval basis.</p><p>By &quot;approximate&quot;, I meant, for example, that<br/>    1/4 CMT:  5 C,  4 E,  4 3/4 G<br/>is an approximation of<br/>    5LJI:     5 C,  4 E,  5 G</p><p>But I see what you&apos;re getting at too.  If &quot;JI systems&quot; are confined to<br/>12-notes-per-octave, then I agree with you.  Extending the idea further,<br/>you could say that 12-notes-per-octave &quot;1/4 CMT systems&quot; are subsets of the<br/>&quot;1/4 CMT universe&quot;.  For example, since I used 6Ab in the 5LJI and 1/4 CMT<br/>systems on the webpage, I couldn&apos;t also have 3G#.</p><p>&gt;Also, I noticed that the 5-limit system you do propose is not one of the<br/>&gt;&quot;famous&quot; ones, though any of the latter would suffer the same problem. Out<br/>&gt;of curiousity, where does your 5-limit system come from?</p><p>Well, for that table entitled &quot;Nowitzkian Note Names for a<br/>12-Notes-Per-Octave Keyboard&quot;, here&apos;s how I arrived at the 5LJI and 1/4 CMT<br/>tunings:</p><p>- The 1/4 CMT tuning corresponds to a tuning shown in an article entitled<br/>&quot;Mean-Tone Temperament, The Classical System of Instrumental Tuning&quot;, by<br/>William Braid White.  This article appeared in the Journal of the<br/>Acoustical Society of America, Volume 15, Number 1, way back in 1943.<br/>Fellow tuning list member Dave Hill sent the article to me a couple months<br/>ago.</p><p>- To get the comma values for 5LJI, I took the 1/4 CMT values and rounded<br/>them to the nearest integer.</p><p>So these tunings put the &quot;wolf&quot; interval at C# to Ab.</p><p>Hey thanks again for your comments,</p><p>--Mark Nowitzky<br/><a href="mailto:nowitzky@alum.mit.edu">nowitzky@alum.mit.edu</a>, AKA <a href="mailto:tuning-owner@egroups.com">tuning-owner@egroups.com</a></p><p>P.S.:  I delayed my reply to your comments, partially &apos;cuz I&apos;ve been<br/>working on a new webpage that I thought would be relevant to the<br/>discussion.

My comment was merely that the famous 12-tone<br/>JI schemes put the wolves in different places, but they&apos;re all pretty much<br/>equally &quot;wolfy&quot;, which is why they all got very little use in practice. Only<br/>in the 15th century did something like a 5-limit JI tuning with 12 fixed<br/>pitches get any real use, and it was really a Pythagorean tuning from Gb to<br/>B, where the triads D-Gb-A, A-Db-E, and E-Ab-B are very nearly 5-limit just<br/>major triads, and the triads Gb-A-Db, Db-E-Ab, and Ab-B-Eb are very nearly<br/>5-limit just minor triads. This is called schismatic tuning, after the<br/>2-cent interval known as a schisma, because, in terms of NNN, 5Gb is only a<br/>schisma away from 4F#, 5Db is only a schisma away from 4C#, and 5Ab is only<br/>a schisma away from 4G#. This, however, was before the 5-limit consonant<br/>standard for triads fully came into vogue, and long before the system of<br/>modes had been reduced to the &quot;major&quot; and &quot;minor&quot; forms of tonality that<br/>characterize the music of Handel, Mozart, etc.</p><p>_________________________________________________</p><p>We are Moving!</p><p>As of June 26, 2000, Acadian Asset Management will be at a<br/>new location in Boston&apos;s financial district.</p><p>Please contact us at:<br/>Acadian Asset Management<br/>Ten Post Office Square, 8th Floor<br/>Boston, MA  02109.</p><p>All phone, fax and email remain the same.</p></div>
