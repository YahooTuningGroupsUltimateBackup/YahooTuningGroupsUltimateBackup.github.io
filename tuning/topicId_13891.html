The 8-note one is called the diminished scale, or, simply, the<br/>octatonic scale (it&apos;s very common), and as we discussed in recent weeks, the<br/>9-note one is called the Tscherepnin scale (Tscherepnin&apos;s son, grandson, and<br/>great-grandson are all composers too -- I know his great-grandson).</p></div>
