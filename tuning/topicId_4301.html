Thus scales such as the whole tone scale, the string of pearls<br/>octatonic,  the symmetrical hexatonic mode that Blackwood likes<br/>(313131), or the modes of limited transposition that Messiaen used are<br/>not MOS. They lack Myhill&apos;s property as the generator (in this case the<br/>repeating block span) comes in only one size, not two, and a cycle of<br/>this interval does not generate all the tones. In fact, Rothenberg<br/>computations are done on just one block of these sub-octaval repeating<br/>scales and the block span functions as the interval of equivalence.</p><p>&gt;Imagine this scene: you&apos;re at a party.  A lovely young woman arrives,<br/>&gt;and somehow you find yourself in conversation with her, and somehow it<br/>&gt;comes around to tuning, and she asks, &quot;But isn&apos;t equal temperament the<br/>&gt;perfect way to tune?  Why would you want to change it?&quot;.</p><p>The appropriate response is &quot;I love it when you talk dirty.&quot;</p><p>--John</p></div><h3><a id=4320 href="#4320">ðŸ”—</a>Paul H.

However, the acoustic simplicity<br/>of the fourth and fifth are in my view essential here for projecting the<br/>similarity relation, and hence for explaining why the diatonic scale is so<br/>remarkably effective. For Rothenberg all that matters is abstract structure<br/>along the pitch axis, and scales with any other intervals of repetition<br/>would be equally effective.</p></div>
