For instance, you could use three octaves of the<br/>score to represent a single octave of your tunign system if<br/>it needs that many notes to an octave.</p><p>Advantage is that anyone can play your score on a conventional<br/>midi keyboard using the usual hand eye coordination- they<br/>read it just as they read any piano score - but<br/>the pitches they hear aren&apos;t as expected.</p><p>Also very easy to do - you can save tthe result as a conventional<br/>midi file and retune it in FTS or SCALA. No need to calculate<br/>any pitch bends, just select the scale you want to use.</p><p>Or you could retune your synth and then play the scordatura twelve equal<br/>score on your synth, if your synth permits arbitrary pitch assignement<br/>to any midi note.</p><p>In Windows anyway you can also use Midi Yoke<br/>which is a very useful little program that adds<br/>midi out devices to your notation program<br/>and midi in devices to FTS / SCALA, and if you<br/>do that then you can play the notes in your<br/>notation program and hear them immediately retuned<br/>as you desire, so you can hear your piece<br/>appropriately tuned while you are working on it too.</p><p>The disadvantage is that the scores you make<br/>are of no use to players of acoustic instruments<br/>unless they can learn to read them.</p><p>Also there is no automatiac way to convert it into<br/>such either, which must be the main reason<br/>composers for acoustic instruments don&apos;t use it<br/>so much (apart from just not knowing about it of<br/>course).</p><p>I think a fully featured microtonalist&apos;s<br/>sequencer / notation program should feature<br/>both these types of score - the scordatura keyboard<br/>as it is far the most convenient for keyboard<br/>players using a midi keyboard, and the<br/>notation + accidentals approach that is needed<br/>for users of acoustic instruments - and it should<br/>be able to automatically convert one to the other<br/>and back again with just a click of a button.</p><p>However, no such program exists yet.<br/>I&apos;d love to write one myself - but it is<br/>so much work I can&apos;t possibly contemplate<br/>it at present unfortunately.</p><p>If your score uses twelve notes to an octave<br/>but tuned in some other system then probably<br/>best is to simply put the notation marks<br/>into the score but not bother with the pitch<br/>bends there, and then retune the resulting midi file<br/>or midi output using this method.</p><p>You can see some pieces I did using this<br/>technique here:</p><p><a href="http://musicandvirtualflowers.co.uk/tunes/tunes.htm">http://musicandvirtualflowers.co.uk/tunes/tunes.htm</a></p><p>Robert</p></div>
