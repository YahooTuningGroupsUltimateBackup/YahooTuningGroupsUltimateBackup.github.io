What pitches (frequencies) might they have used to tune their keyboards?  The Xenharmonikon 6 (Summer, 1977) has a page comparing 31 equal temp. to quarter comma meantone showing that the tunings were  nearly alike.<br/>    I would like to select a 12 tones per octave scale (plus the extra tones for the split keys) and make a fixed tuning onto an instrument.  The selection of tones would be from the 31--meantone chart.  I could start  C and use the intervals of the 31 equal as: 1 (C), 3 (C#), 6 (D), 8(D#), 9(Eb), 11(E), 14(F), 16(F#), 19(G),  21(G#), 22(Ab), 24(A 440Hz), 26(A#)or 27(Bb), 29(B) and the next would be C of the next octave.  I do not have any data as to what pitches they might have tuned their keyboards.<br/>    Alita Morrison</p></div><h3><a id=17057 href="#17057">ðŸ”—</a>Paul H.

Is that what you were asking? Or are there particular<br/>_relative_ pitch values (for, say, 1/4-comma meantone or 31-tET; in, say,<br/>cents) that you were looking for?</p></div>
