I&apos;ll send you the article.  An excerpt from pages 107 reads as<br/>follows:</p><p>The interval between the two pitches on a zhong bell is selected by<br/>casting and tuning.  The choice of the interval is arbitrary, but it<br/>should suit the melodic progression of the compositions it will<br/>perform.  In addition the interval should not be a discord since, in<br/>spite of the efforts of the designers, traces of the secondary tone may<br/>persist after the primary tone has died down.  Zhou engineers tuned<br/>their bells so that the intervals of the overtones, as well as those of<br/>the fundamentals, were harmonics.  The second partial of the gu tone,<br/>for example, is always an octave plus a major or minor third above the<br/>sui tone; the partials of a zhong bell with a minor third separating its<br/>two pitches are in the ratio 1:1.2:2.4:2.81:3 and those of a bell with<br/>an interval of a major third are 1:1.25:2.5:2.81:3.</p><p>When bell-chime intervals from several periods are compared, a<br/>historical trend toward the major- and minor-third intervals represented<br/>in Marquis Yi&apos;s bell collection becomes apparent. . . .<br/>RT</p><p>Subject: Re: [tuning] Digest Number 375<br/>Date: Mon, 1 Nov 1999 10:24:03 -0500<br/>From: martin hatch &lt;<a href="mailto:mfh2@cornell.edu">mfh2@cornell.edu</a>&gt;<br/>Reply-To: <a href="mailto:tuning@onelist.com">tuning@onelist.com</a><br/>To: <a href="mailto:tuning@onelist.com">tuning@onelist.com</a></p><p>From: martin hatch &lt;<a href="mailto:mfh2@cornell.edu">mfh2@cornell.edu</a>&gt;</p><p>&quot;Tuning&quot; people,<br/>Can anyone tell me the location of an article on the tuning (including<br/>partials) of the original Hubei Marquis Yi bells? I specify &quot;original&quot;<br/>because the bells that toured the U.S. (and are recorded on the Fontana<br/>CD<br/>called &quot;The Imperial Bells of China&quot;) are facsimiles made in the 20th<br/>century.  In my quick spectral analysis of the tuning of a couple of the</p><p>bells from the facsimiles, I think that the partials have been tuned as<br/>1:1, 2:1, 3:1, 4:1, and 5:1 (the lowest bell is 172.3, 344.7, 516.5,<br/>689.4,<br/>and 861.2). Were the originals that way?</p><p>Marty Hatch</p><p>Marty Hatch<br/>Department of Music<br/>Lincoln Hall (now in White Hall 316)<br/>Cornell University<br/>Ithaca, New York 14850, U.S.A.<br/>607-2555049<br/>fax: 607-2542877</p></div>
