I can, unfortunately, kind of understand this... The question<br/>&gt; &gt; I have here for our Troubadour, or any other mental souls on this<br/>&gt; &gt; list... is how one actually orients onself to these perfectly<br/>&gt; &gt; symmetrical keyboards??  As someone who made a living as a<br/>&gt; &gt; professional pianist for 12 years (yikes!), I would be interested.  I<br/>&gt; &gt; want to play Chopin on it...<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; With blank video cassettes, you get sheets of stickers with letters on them so<br/>&gt; that you can label the tapes.  Collect these stickers, and put one behind<br/>&gt; each key named by that letter.  That helps a bit, but it&apos;s a hassle to change<br/>&gt; them.  Also, they have a habit of falling off.  Another thing is to write on the<br/>&gt; white keys using a marker pen.  I expect enamel paint would do the<br/>&gt; same job more permanently.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; A thing I do with all keyboards, and it&apos;s how I originally learnt to play, is<br/>&gt; to write out the scale or chords onto a strip of paper.  Then, slide that strip<br/>&gt; up and down the keyboard so that you know what to play.  The only problem with<br/>&gt; this for extended mappings is finding a long enough strip of paper.</p><p>Hi, Graham and Joseph!  Two words: masking tape.</p><p>--<br/>David J.
