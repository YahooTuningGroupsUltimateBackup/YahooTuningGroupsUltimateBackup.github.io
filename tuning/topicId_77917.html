In the end, I made two scales. The first one is definitely a rank 3 temperament, the second one am I not sure about; but I think it might be called that as well (though I&apos;m still in doubt if it isn&apos;t actually rank 4). Both of them have a period of 2/1. In the first case, one of the generators is a 15/13 widened slightly by 1/2 of the comma (used 5 times) and the other one is a 16/13 widened by 1/4 of the comma (used only once). In the second scale, I essentially split the factor into the following intervals: 4/3, 13/16, 4/5, 4/3, 13/16, 4/5, 4/3. I used the repeating sequence of the three intervals and tempered each of them by 1/7 of the comma in order to temper it out. But because 7 tones seemed too few to me, I made a set of 13 tones this way (or actually 14, if I count the 1/1 as the first tone). As a result, I got some pitches repeated. These were eventually removed after I normalized all that into a single octave range, which resulted in a 11-tone scale.</p><p>Here&apos;s what they sound like.
