We all post something moronic once in a while.<br/>You&apos;ll fit in just fine.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I&apos;m wondering if this issue of &apos;sharpness&apos; has any significance in two<br/>&gt; isolated situations.  There was a small New York jazz scene (early 80&apos;s)<br/>&gt; where players were intentionally trying to play as sharp as possible, maybe<br/>&gt; to increase tension or a sense of &apos;outsideness&apos;.  As well, it seemed to me<br/>&gt; that a couple years back, alot of pop albums were coming out where the<br/>&gt; singers were singing sharp.  It seemed like a conscious decision (I think<br/>&gt; maybe Alanis Morrisette might have accidentally started the trend).  Any<br/>&gt; insight on the aesthetics of sharpness?</p><p>I&apos;d be interested in _what she(?) sharps. Thirds? Fifths? Tonics? Can you<br/>recommend any particular tracks to listen to?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Also, is there some bit of info I&apos;m missing?  I don&apos;t think I&apos;ve had trouble<br/>&gt; singing a 5/4 (since I&apos;ve become aware of tuning issues) - are we talking<br/>&gt; about a specific situation in which these low ratios are difficult to tune?</p><p>It&apos;s not a matter of difficulty, Paul. It has to do with the observation<br/>that singers seem to prefer a third slightly higher than tempered (12-tET)<br/>when the fifth is sounding. (Has anyone kept track of particularly<br/>significant editions of the List Digest on this topic? I probably should be,<br/>but I&apos;m basically lazy.)<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Oh yeah, where can I find the article by &apos;Margo&apos;</p><p>The one I was referring to was posted on Feb 22, on Digest number 545. My<br/>interest had to do with her comments regarding singers historically tending<br/>toward JI tuning.</p><p>Have fun, Paul. We are!</p><p>Jerry</p></div>
