We can think of<br/>7-limit intervals as represented by a cubic lattice of monzos Z4,<br/>consisting of quadruples of integers |w x y z&gt; with the ordinary<br/>Euclidean metric. Suppose we decide to represent the lattice of octave<br/>equivalence classes by means of a representative interval, with the<br/>property that w+x+y+z=0. We can reduce an interval to its octave-class<br/>representative by</p><p>red(q) = 2^(-ordp(q,3)-ordp(q,5)-ordp(q,7)) * 3^ordp(q,3) 5^ordp(q,5)<br/>7^ordp(q,7)</p><p>where ordp is the p-adic valuation, meaning the monzo coordinate value<br/>corresponding to the prime p, so that</p><p>q = 2^ordp(2,q) 3^ordp(3,q) 5^ordp(5,q) 7^ordp(7,q)</p><p>If |w x y z&gt; is a monzo, then red(|w x y z&gt;)  = |-x-y-z x y z&gt;.</p><p>We now find the symmetrical lattice of octave classes, with its<br/>octahedra and tetrahedra and so forth, is just the sublattice of<br/>reduced representatives, under the Eulicidean metric.

It is easy to verify that these are the<br/>verticies of an octahedron in four-dimensional space, so here you have<br/>the hexany sitting inside of a cubic (4D) lattice.</p><p>________________________________________________________________________<br/>________________________________________________________________________</p><p>Message: 4<br/>   Date: Mon, 7 Mar 2005 13:34:34 -0800 (PST)<br/>   From: novosonic productions &lt;<a href="mailto:novosonic@yahoo.com">novosonic@yahoo.com</a>&gt;<br/>Subject: 53 numerology</p><p>i thought i would post this, instead of trying to be<br/>counterproductive and argue nuances.</p><p>but, i&apos;m not sure if this plain peculiar...</p><p>BBC NEWS | Europe | Number 53 brings relief to Italy<br/>Number 53 brings relief to Italy<br/>The elusive number 53, blamed for several deaths and bankruptcies, has<br/>finally<br/>popped up in the Venice lottery after a two-year wait.<br/>Italians had bet more than 3.5bn euros (&pound;2.4bn), hoping that 53 would turn<br/>up,<br/>in what became a national obsession.<br/>Last month a woman drowned herself in the sea off Tuscany after she bet the<br/>family savings on 53, Reuters reports.<br/>And police said a man living near Florence shot his wife and son and then<br/>himself because of his number 53 debts.<br/>The Italian national lotto invites bets of any amount on numbers from 1 to<br/>90<br/>in<br/>bi-weekly draws.<br/>The draws take place in 10 cities across the country.

This lattice has two<br/>sizes of hole, the &quot;deep holes&quot; are the octahedrons, and the &quot;shallow<br/>holes&quot; tetrahedrons.

A basic property of logarithms is that<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; log(a^b) = b*log(a)<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; So if we say that g1=1200 cents represents prime 2 = 2:1, then<br/>&gt; 2*g1=2400 cents represents 2^2 = 4:1, 3*g1=3600 cents represents<br/>2^3<br/>&gt; = 8:1, 4*g1=4800 cents represents 2^4 = 16:1, and 5*g1=6000 cents<br/>&gt; represents 2^5 = 32:1, etc. And if g3=2786 cents represents prime 5<br/>&gt; = 5:1, then 2*g1=5572 cents represents 5^2 = 25:1, and 3*g1=8358<br/>&gt; cents represents 5^3 = 125:1.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Making sense?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I&apos;m sure it does to math-people like yourself, but give me some<br/>&gt;more time to understand the relationships.</p><p>OK . . . let&apos;s take a step back. Do you normally consider interval<br/>sizes in cents? Or in some other system of units? Would you agree<br/>than an octave is a 2:1 ratio, and that a triple-octave is an 8:1<br/>ratio? Or does this mystify you?</p><p>&gt; BTW, how do you feel about tempered octaves? If you approve of<br/>them,<br/>&gt; I might use the TOP temperament of 4000:3993 alone, whose<br/>&gt; approximations to the primes can be calculated with the formulas in<br/>&gt; the paper I sent you.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; That would be swell Paul. You mean widening the octaves of course,<br/>&gt;don&apos;t you? Otherwise I would hear them to be unduly dissonant. My<br/>&gt;Bechstein grand has the octaves stretched by a few cents you know (I<br/>&gt;instructed the tuners myself). That creates a brilliant effect in<br/>&gt;fff passages.</p><p>I wasn&apos;t thinking of a piano, because the scale in question will have<br/>too many notes per octave to be expressible on a piano. A piano has<br/>stretched overtones, which is why stretched octaves sound great on<br/>it. However, many other instruments, such as bowed strings,<br/>brass/wind instruments, and the human voice have harmonic overtones.<br/>For such instruments, a stretched octave won&apos;t sound much less<br/>discordant than a similarly compressed octave, based on my experience<br/>and knowledge. But perhaps you have found otherwise? Perhaps you&apos;re<br/>only speaking of *melodic* octaves, not harmonic (simultaneously-<br/>sounding) ones?</p><p>&gt;&gt; Hopefully the first case above is now equally clear to you. Let me<br/>&gt;&gt; know if it isn&apos;t. Also, I&apos;d encourage you to write a similar<br/>&gt;&gt; paragraph explaining how 81:80 vanishes in meantone temperament --<br/>I<br/>&gt;&gt; think you&apos;d learn something about both the general idea of<br/>&gt;&gt; temperament and about the specific example in which Western common<br/>&gt;&gt; practice music arose.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt; Urm... Let&apos;s see... For 81:80 to vanish, I need the numerator of<br/>&gt;this interval to be equal to the denumerator. Since the syntonic<br/>&gt;comma is a 5-limit interval, the system will have the primes 2,3 and<br/>&gt;5, making this a three dimensional system of tuning. Right?</p><p>Most likely, though for your example of 4000:3993, which is an 11-<br/>limit interval, I was thinking, instead of letting</p><p>&gt;Tempering out the syntonic comma will result in the upper-most<br/>&gt;dimension (prime) to collapse,</p><p>What do you mean uppermost? The largest? How do you know this? What<br/>is it about the syntonic comma that allows you to reach this<br/>conclusion?</p><p>&gt;creating a temperament of 2 dimensions. So, the first dimension is<br/>&gt;the octave with 2:1 which will remain untouched for my purposes, and<br/>&gt;the second dimension is the tempered perfect fifth with the ratio<br/>&gt;3:2 and the third dimension is the tempered pure third with the<br/>&gt;ratio 5:4.</p><p>I thought you said 2 dimensions?</p><p>&gt; Prime factorizing 81:80 gives me<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; 3*3*3*3 (3^4) for the numerator<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; and<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; 2*2*2*2*5 (2^4 * 5^1) for the denumerator.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; So, will you help me figure out the rest?</p><p>You seem to have left out some of your reasoning above. Perhaps it<br/>was valid, perhaps it wasn&apos;t . . . I&apos;m not sure unless you fill it in<br/>for me.</p><p>________________________________________________________________________<br/>________________________________________________________________________</p><p>Message: 10<br/>   Date: Mon, 07 Mar 2005 23:50:54 -0000<br/>   From: &quot;wallyesterpaulrus&quot; &lt;<a href="mailto:wallyesterpaulrus@yahoo.com">wallyesterpaulrus@yahoo.com</a>&gt;<br/>Subject: Re: Diatonic Maqams</p><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;Ozan Yarman&quot; &lt;ozanyarman@s...&gt; wrote:</p><p>&gt; I entertained the idea that ditonic scales (beginning with 9:8+9:8)<br/>&gt;form the backbone of diatonic scales Paul.

You can use Hermite normal<br/>&gt; form, and &quot;find&quot; the generators of 225/224-planar in the sense of<br/>&gt; saying that<br/>&gt; some tuning of 2, 3, and 5 will work; but you also could, for<br/>&gt; instance, find TOP tunings for 2, 3, 5, and 7.</p><p>I could have easily told Ozan how the primes would be tuned by TOP<br/>for the temperament in question. But finding a set of generators<br/>(even abstractly) brings you a step closer to actually constructing a<br/>reasonable scale in that temperament. And for that I relied on your<br/>post. Now I&apos;m asking you a question about your methods, but as far as<br/>I can tell, you&apos;re not answering.</p><p>&gt; Most of the time people<br/>&gt; are talking about linear temperaments,</p><p>I never use that term anymore, and George Secor agrees with my new<br/>usage. It partly came down to, believe it or not Pete, respect for<br/>Erv Wilson&apos;s original usage of and meaning for the term, which we<br/>believe would not encompass a lot of the systems where the octave is<br/>more than one period that we used to call &quot;linear temperaments.&quot;</p><p>&gt; in which case you find the<br/>&gt; period and, perhaps, the smallest generator &gt; 1 according to some<br/>&gt; optimization.</p><p>________________________________________________________________________<br/>________________________________________________________________________</p><p>Message: 22<br/>   Date: Tue, 8 Mar 2005 12:49:49 +1100<br/>   From: &quot;Yahya Abdal-Aziz&quot; &lt;<a href="mailto:yahya@melbpc.org.au">yahya@melbpc.org.au</a>&gt;<br/>Subject: RE: Digest Number 3431</p><p>Dave,</p><p>Great title!  :-)</p><p>I&apos;ll have another go at downloading some of your work.

Wouldn&apos;t you instead want a notation where a chain<br/>&gt; of two superimposed [1 0 0]s yields a [2 0 0]? Otherwise it seems<br/>&gt; you&apos;d tie yourself in knots.</p><p>I probably need to use a different symbol than brackets then, since I mean<br/>to simply draw a &quot;Pythagorean roadmap&quot; rather than indicate a vector.</p><p>There are alternative systems, one of them having the first number indicate<br/>12-TET steps. I just thought of another that has the first number actually<br/>indicate 9/8 major seconds, then a flat or sharp could be placed next to it<br/>if you want to shift the note up or down by 2187/2048. But that would make<br/>a<br/>perfect fifth [b3 0 0] and a perfect octave [6 -1 0], which looks odd to<br/>me.</p><p>________________________________________________________________________<br/>________________________________________________________________________</p><p>You can configure your subscription by sending an empty email to one<br/>of these addresses (from the address at which you receive the list):<br/>  <a href="mailto:tuning-subscribe@yahoogroups.com">tuning-subscribe@yahoogroups.com</a> - join the tuning group.<br/>  <a href="mailto:tuning-unsubscribe@yahoogroups.com">tuning-unsubscribe@yahoogroups.com</a> - leave the group.<br/>  <a href="mailto:tuning-nomail@yahoogroups.com">tuning-nomail@yahoogroups.com</a> - turn off mail from the group.<br/>  <a href="mailto:tuning-digest@yahoogroups.com">tuning-digest@yahoogroups.com</a> - set group to send daily digests.<br/>  <a href="mailto:tuning-normal@yahoogroups.com">tuning-normal@yahoogroups.com</a> - set group to send individual emails.<br/>  <a href="mailto:tuning-help@yahoogroups.com">tuning-help@yahoogroups.com</a> - receive general help information.</p><p>------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>Yahoo!
