It means the bases have to be orthogonal, which works<br/>fine for octave-specific just intonation, but not<br/>temperamental complexity.  I think JI is fine in this case<br/>because the generators constitute a subgroup and you want<br/>to find the simplest generators.</p><p>Carl&apos;s method for finding unison vectors to use to generate<br/>periodicity blocks was like this.

If I knew how to do that, I would try to find such a pair of generators which makes the complexity as low as possible in terms of prime mapping. What I&apos;m not sure about, however, is whether a substantial number of temperaments would come out with different generators if I wanted the lowest possible complexity for a complete 9-limit chord like 2:3:5:7:9.

In the 2D case, the generator is 9/5 and the period is then 7/2, if I&apos;m correct. In the 3D case where the period is 2/1, the two generators in question would be 9/5 and 5/3, if I&apos;ve understood what&apos;s been said so far.

This is what I can surely do, and I&apos;m looking forward to the results.<br/>The other idea was to find such generators for 3D temperaments which give them the lowest possible complexity in terms of approximating 1:3:5:7 (and possiby 9) if the equivalence interval is 2/1. Unfortunately, I&apos;m not mathematically skilled enough to be able to do that.
