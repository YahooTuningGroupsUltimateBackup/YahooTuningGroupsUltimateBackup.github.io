I&apos;ll try again though.</p><p>&gt; &gt;So I simply made a six line staff with your idea of the 1 3 5 7 9 1<br/>&gt; vertically<br/>&gt; &gt;up the side. I take this to be the &apos;default&apos; Standard  Pentachordal<br/>&gt; &gt;Major.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Not quite -- it&apos;s a symmetrical, rather than pentachordal, decatonic mode.</p><p> I have put up a temporary page with the notation at<br/><a href="http://homepages.which.net/~alison.monteith3">http://homepages.which.net/~alison.monteith3</a>  Forgive me for not explaining<br/>myself clearly. I take the 1 to 9 up the side to refer to the steps of  the<br/>Pentachordal Major. So line one is step 0 or 22, space one is step 2, etc. This<br/>then is the default, no sharps no flats scale.</p><p>&gt; &gt;Maybe I&apos;ll just use the lowest &apos;e&apos; on guitar<br/>&gt; &gt;for now, though this is a problem that will need an answer if a<br/>&gt; conventional<br/>&gt; &gt;notational system is adopted.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; The problem solved itself quite naturally to me -- since 1-5 and 6-0 are the<br/>&gt; only 9:7 major thirds in the &quot;natural&quot; scale, and since I use a guitar tuned<br/>&gt; in a 22-tET tuning very close standard tuning except the major third between<br/>&gt; the second and third strings is the 9:7 major third, my guitar strings are<br/>&gt; either tuned, low to high, 9-3-7-1-5-9, or 4-8-2-6-0-4, it doesn&apos;t matter<br/>&gt; which, all the key signatures and everything come out the same with either<br/>&gt; choice.</p><p>I&apos;ll need to look back to your paper to follow your numbers here, but I get the<br/>gist. Out of lazy habit I&apos;ve been tuning to a Boss tuner which I suppose gives<br/>accurate cent measurements but have found the intonation to need adjustment.<br/>Perhaps tuning strings to each other would be better.<br/>The tonic question, however, still seems to me to be unresolved. All that this<br/>notational system does is to tell an instrumentalist to press this key, or to<br/>fret this note. If we had a 22- tet band with guitar, keyboard and tuned<br/>percussion, say marimba , wouldn&apos;t we need to find a common our &quot;zero&quot; note in<br/>order to play a piece together?</p><p>I always think of middle &apos;c&apos; as the zero note of the &apos;default&apos; scale in 12 -<br/>tet because of the conventional piano. Poor brass and wind players have to<br/>transpose. Going  back to our fictitious band. If I was the  guitarist I would<br/>probably want to choose an open string, probably &apos;e&apos;, as the zero note,<br/>certainly not the &apos;c&apos; as it lies on the guitar. The tuned percussionist might<br/>conceivably  want the lowest note on the instrument. The digital keyboard<br/>player would have no problem, but I&apos;m imagining a fixed pitch harpsichord,<br/>organ or piano that once tuned stays that way for a while. Agreement needs to<br/>be be reached  to avoid asking players to transpose at will.<br/>Please correct me if I&apos;m wrong, but at some point, were 22-tet to become<br/>incredibly popular or considered for adoption as a new standard (who knows),<br/>then an actual frequency would need to be chosen as our zero note.</p><p>I also haven&apos;t worked out the key signatures. I suppose some will be hybrid<br/>sharp/flat signatures.</p><p>Best Wishes</p></div><h3><a id=13566 href="#13566">ðŸ”—</a>Paul H.

The only valid test of any notational system is<br/>whether it is practical and readable. I will get back to composing some studies and will try<br/>to notate them using both systems for comparison. I&apos;m not particularly attached to my<br/>proposal, it just seems simple and logical and easy for the guitar on the face of it so I<br/>thought I&apos;d share it. Your system stems from the keyboard but as you say works well for the<br/>guitar. I&apos;m still not sure about the business of middle C.

The argument for the<br/>adoption of a new tuning standard seems to imply that the large symphony orchestra has a<br/>future as a JI/Microtonal institution.  The new music seems to me to be essentially  written<br/>for electronics, Partch type ensembles, and adapted individual instruments.  I think this is<br/>an important topic because in my experience composing for the symphony orchestra is still seen<br/>as the pinnacle of achievement  in many composition courses. I have absolutely no interest in<br/>this as my interests lie in JI/Microtonal composition. Non-12 compositions for the orchestra<br/>are pretty thin on the ground. Perhaps, as Sethares and others suggest the, modern orchestra<br/>is timbrally optimised for 12-tet .

Or will we see &apos;schools&apos; throughout the world with<br/>their own instrument ensembles and tuning and notational systems?

MANY microtonal works for full<br/>orchestra in New York.  I think Johnny has pretty much proven that<br/>the large symphony orchestra is really no different that a small<br/>ensemble in terms of the ability to produce microtonality... given<br/>enough rehearsal time and the positive attitude of the musicians...<br/>And, as for microtonal works for orchestra... there are oodles of<br/>them!  I&apos;m sure Johnny could rattle off 20 from the top of his head,<br/>without looking anything up!</p><p>The question, I believe, is more the PRACTICALITY of producing the<br/>symphony orchestra for ANY new works, microtonal or 12-tET.  Johnny<br/>is a Hercules in this respect, but that&apos;s what it takes... since our<br/>culture is not fostering... through grants anymore (NEA used to do a<br/>little of it) the production of new pieces by the symphony<br/>orchestra...  The American Composers&apos; Orchestra and the Manhattan<br/>School of Music orchestras are about the only two that consistently<br/>produce new works...</p><p>Insofar as considering the symphony orchestra the &quot;ultimate&quot; in<br/>expression... well... that&apos;s &quot;old hat.&quot;  In fact, that attitude went<br/>&quot;out the window&quot; with most professional composers in the 1960s...<br/>although mostly due to the fact that new music became complex, and<br/>more difficult to produce, so orchestras didn&apos;t want to devote the<br/>rehearsal time to it.  The orchestra is coming back in vogue, though,<br/>with the &quot;New Romanticists&quot;... Most of the music is pretty &quot;yucky,&quot;<br/>in my opinion, but the orchestra is coming back in some quarters.</p><p>As a related aside: I&apos;m attending the Lou Harrison piano concerto by<br/>the ACO in a couple of weeks...

Maybe this is what<br/>you were aiming for.</p><p>I&apos;ll put my cards on the table right from the start: I prefer Fokker&apos;s<br/>system. But I&apos;ll try to be as unbiased as I can in the following.</p><p>By the way, when I earlier suggested using &quot;^&quot; and &quot;v&quot; as accidentals in a<br/>diaschismic notation, I was being facetious. These are already used to mean<br/>so many different things it isn&apos;t funny. Below I&apos;ll use the original<br/>author&apos;s + and - in the Johnston notation and / and \ in the Fokker and ^<br/>and v in yours, but you can of course change them to whatever you like.</p><p>22-EDO and 34-EDO are both diaschismic, so the notations I gave previously,<br/>on lattices, for 34-EDO, are just as valid for 22-EDO. These were all in<br/>the Fokker style.</p><p>Fokker&apos;s is based on a Pythagorean scale, Johnston&apos;s on a JI-major scale.<br/>Fokker&apos;s names a major third from C as E\ (as you did originally) while<br/>Johnston&apos;s names it E (as you do currently). A minor third from C is named<br/>Eb/ in Fokkers (as in yours) but Eb in Johnston&apos;s.</p><p>Fokker&apos;s can name all fifths and thirds in a uniform manner (all fifths are<br/>the same as usual, all major thirds are lowered by \ from the usual, all<br/>minor thirds are raised by / from the usual). Any system that gives you the<br/>familiar A E B as major thirds, or Ab, Eb, Bb as minor thirds, from F C G,<br/>must pay for it by having non-uniform naming elsewhere in the lattice. e.g.<br/>A perfect fifth from D is A+ in Johnston&apos;s.</p><p>Of course none of these will give you a single fixed notation that will be<br/>suitable for all uses of 22-EDO. These are notation _systems_. The<br/>particular choice of note names will depend on what &quot;key&quot; a piece is in,<br/>i.e. what part of the lattice it is centered on, and whether the<br/>appropriate lattice is 5-limit or 7-limit. I&apos;ve made the following<br/>assumption about how to shape and center the (5-limit) lattice, based on<br/>your proposed names:</p><p>            12  3   16  7   20  11  2<br/>      14   5  18  9   0   13  4   17  8   21       22-EDO degrees<br/>                2   15  6   19  10  1</p><p>            G\  D\  A\  E\  B\ F#\<br/>      Ab  Eb  Bb  F   C   G   D   A   E   B        Fokker    Pythagorean based<br/>                Db/ Ab/ Eb/ Bb/ F/  C/</p><p>            Gv  Dv  A   E   B   F#<br/>      Ab  Eb  Bb  F   C   G   D   A^  E^  B^       Proposed<br/>                Db Ab^ Eb^ Bb^  F^  C^</p><p>            Gv  Dv  Av  E   B   F#<br/>     Abv Ebv  Bb  F   C   G   D   A   E^  B^       12/24-tET based, C:G<br/>centered<br/>                Db  Ab  Eb Bb^  F^  C^</p><p>            G-  D-  A   E   B  F#+<br/>      Ab- Eb- Bb- F   C   G   D   A+  E+  B+       Johnston  JI-major based</p><p>               Db- Ab  Eb  Bb  F+  C+</p><p>Here we compare them in pitch order.

(To be fair<br/>to Johnston, his notation is intended for JI, not temperaments.) While your<br/>center agrees with theirs, things are relatively familiar. Once your center<br/>moves away from theirs, it starts to get very messy very fast. With<br/>Fokker&apos;s system you have to get used to a small unfamiliarity right from<br/>the start, that major and minor thirds (and of course sixths) have<br/>accidentals, but this remains constant no matter where your center moves to.</p><p>Also don&apos;t forget, if we pad the lattices out with duplicate notes (in<br/>parenthesis) so we can see all the 5-limit intervals available in 22-EDO<br/>(i.e. to show how the lattice wraps around), we get:</p><p>          (6)(19)(10)(1) (14)(5) (18)<br/>   (8) (21) 12  3   16  7   20  11  2  (15)(6)<br/> (1)  14   5  18  9   0   13  4   17  8   21 (12)    22-EDO degrees<br/>   (7) (20)(11) 2   15  6   19  10  1  (14)(5)<br/>             (17)(8) (21)(12)(3) (16)(7)</p><p>If you start using any intervals with the parenthesised notes you would<br/>effectively be changing keys, and you might want to use a different name<br/>for the parenthesised note, compared to how it is named near the center of<br/>the lattice (unparenthesised) (e.g. exchanging a sharp for a flat or vice<br/>versa). I can tell you how this works for Fokker&apos;s and Johnston&apos;s systems,<br/>but not your proposal or the 12/24-based one.</p><p>Regards,<br/>-- Dave Keenan<br/>Brisbane, Australia<br/><a href="http://dkeenan.com">http://dkeenan.com</a></p></div><h3><a id=26118 href="#26118">ðŸ”—</a>mschulter &#x3C;MSCHULTER@VALUE.NET&#x3E;</h3><span>7/8/2001 8:37:52 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Hello, there, everyone, and thank you, Alison and Herman, for sharing<br/>notation systems showing some of the approaches to 22-tET.</p><p>As it happens, my own approach ties in with a &quot;regularized&quot; keyboard<br/>designed for a neo-Gothic style, with regular whole-tones of four<br/>steps and diatonic semitones of one step. Regular major thirds are<br/>~436.36 cents, and minor thirds ~272.73 cents -- close to 9:7 and<br/>7:6.</p><p>This is what I call an eventone tuning -- or more generally an<br/>evenstep tuning -- with major seconds very close here to the mean<br/>between 9:8 and 8:7. One might say that it&apos;s near a &quot;1/4 septimal<br/>comma eventone.&quot;</p><p>In addition to the usual sharps and flats, spelled just as in<br/>Pythagorean or meantone (here sharps are higher than flats, of course,<br/>as in Pythagorean), I&apos;ve found a &quot;+&quot; symbol convenient to show a note<br/>raised by 2/22 octave or ~109.09 cents. This is the distance between<br/>my two regularized 12-note keyboards, each sharing the same pattern of<br/>steps and intervals. Note that Eb/C#+ and Bb/G#+ appear on both<br/>keyboards:</p><p>     273    381           764        982    1091<br/>   C#+/Eb  Eb+/D#        F#+/Ab     G#+/Bb  Bb+/A#<br/> C+       D+     E+/Gb F+       G+        A+     B+/Db  C+<br/>109      327      545 600      818       1036     1255 1309<br/>-----------------------------------------------------------<br/>     164    273           655        873     982<br/>      C#    Eb             F#         G#     Bb<br/> C        D        E   F        G          A       B    C<br/> 0       218      436 491      709        927     1145 1200</p><p>In this system, a sharp or flat raises or lowers a note by three<br/>steps, with diatonic semitones equal to one step or ~54.55 cents.</p><p>A neat feature of this tuning is that we get ~12:14:18:21 and<br/>~14:18:21:24 sonorities on every step, using the regular spellings.<br/>In neo-Gothic music, these are typically unstable sonorities resolving<br/>to a stable 2:3:4 or the like, as in this example:</p><p>&lt;<a href="http://value.net/~mschulter/22tei002.mid">http://value.net/~mschulter/22tei002.mid</a>&gt;</p><p>However, there&apos;s no reason why someone couldn&apos;t use 22-tET in this<br/>arrangement for a style with these sonorities treated as stable<br/>saturated tetrads. It might have a very interesting &quot;21st-century&quot;<br/>sound.</p><p>One thing that may come out of this kind of exchange is to show how<br/>different notations or keyboard arrangements might fit different<br/>styles.</p><p>At the very least, I&apos;d say, for example, that a system based on usual<br/>intervals forming sonorities of 14:18:21:24 might call for a different<br/>notation than one based on Paul Erlich&apos;s tetrads at 4:5:6:7.
