Szanto&quot; &lt;<a href="mailto:jszanto@adnc.com">jszanto@adnc.com</a>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;To Jerry Eskelin,<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;I&apos;ve read with interest your discussions of triads &apos;locking&apos; for vocalists,<br/>&gt;and agree that &apos;instruments&apos; of infinite pitch resolution (fretless<br/>&gt;strings, vocal chords, etc) would seem optimal rather than stepped<br/>&gt;resolutions (no matter how small).<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;Even though you plan on making musical examples, is there any way you can<br/>&gt;put into words the feeling of &apos;locking&apos;?

The feeling you describe is one of<br/>the pleasures I find in singing music in an ensemble (or listening to such<br/>music). I would describe it as in tune, in focus, in sync, locked,<br/>ensemble, in step, fused, or together. I find that when a chord is locked,<br/>which I believe involves accuracy of pitch, vowel, and dynamics, everyone<br/>agrees about it being locked. For me it feels as if there is a new thing in<br/>the room. I think that the pleasure of singing harmony (in my group,<br/>generally five-part) comes from the fact that the individuals are able to<br/>come together and create something that no one could on his own, while each<br/>maintains his individuality. It is pleasurable to be in such a relationship<br/>with others.</p><p>Your example of learning a descending scale of small intervals feeling<br/>larger and larger is important in that it shows that our perceptual<br/>abilities are not fixed but may be developed through appropriate learning<br/>situations. Because of this I&apos;ve always been suspicious when I&apos;ve read some<br/>report of the just-perceivable difference in pitch, as if that were a fixed<br/>quantity. I know that it can be decreased as we learn to increase our<br/>sensitivity. A contrasting experience I&apos;ve had as a singer is that of<br/>feeling like the leap of an octave is a _small_ distance. That feeling can<br/>be produced by experimenting with arpeggios and leaps of two octaves or<br/>more, or playing funny games like singing a simple melody and tranposing<br/>every other note up an octave.</p><p>John Link</p><p>****************************************************************************</p><p>Watch for the CD &quot;Live at Saint Peter&apos;s&quot; by the JOHN LINK VOCAL QUINTET,<br/>featuring original compositions as well as arrangements of instrumental<br/>music by Brahe and Taylor, Chick Corea, Miles Davis, Claude Debussy, Bill<br/>Evans, Ennio and Andrea Morricone, Modeste Mussorgsky, Erik Satie, and Earl<br/>Zindars.</p><p>****************************************************************************</p><p>Check out <a href="http://WWW.DUESBERG.COM">WWW.DUESBERG.COM</a> for information that could make the difference<br/>between life and death for you or someone you know.</p><p>****************************************************************************</p></div><h3><a id=7685 href="#7685">ðŸ”—</a>Gerald Eskelin &#x3C;stg3music@xxxxxxxxx.xxxx&#x3E;</h3><span>1/10/2000 4:18:13 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>&gt; From Jon Szanto to Jerry Eskelin:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Even though you plan on making musical examples, is there any way you can<br/>&gt; put into words the feeling of &apos;locking&apos;? I remember some of the few times<br/>&gt; I&apos;ve been employed as a vocalist (I&apos;m sure I would fall into Paul&apos;s &quot;poor&quot;<br/>&gt; category), and the moments when I would hit a pitch (along with the others)<br/>&gt; that it was like the sound world suddenly came into focus.

The basic feeling of &quot;locking&quot; can be experienced by<br/>singing a sliding pitch upward over a sustained drone. And, happily, you CAN<br/>try this at home. :-)</p><p>Sustain a synth (or organ) pitch in your moderately low vocal range using a<br/>fairly simple timbre (flute or string works fine). Match that pitch vocally<br/>(including its timbre) and then slide your voice upward extremely slowly,<br/>savoring every little change in consonance as you move the pitch. (Don&apos;t<br/>forget to breathe once in a while.)</p><p>As you move off the unison, the dissonance will be violent at first and then<br/>will move into regions of relative consonance. When you find a node of<br/>consonance, move back and forth (up and down) to find its point of optimum<br/>&quot;agreement.&quot; That&apos;s what I call &quot;locking.&quot; Some call it &quot;the point of<br/>minimum beating.&quot; The easiest node to tune is, of course, the perfect fifth<br/>(2:3), then the major third (4:5), etc. However, you will notice other<br/>subtle points of agreement along the way. I find that this experience really<br/>clarifies the nature of pitch relations for my beginning students and they<br/>become less dependent on the old 88. (For all you young synth dudes, that&apos;s<br/>a standard piano. :-)</p><p>Your &quot;Grand Canyon&quot; feeling is a good analogy of well-tuned intervals. I<br/>understand what you mean. It often comes as a surprise to singers--even<br/>experienced ones--that a minor second can lock in as clearly and accurately<br/>as a perfect fifth. &quot;In tune&quot; is &quot;in tune&quot; relative to the dissonance in the<br/>&quot;space&quot; around the node.</p><p>In regard to &quot;locking&quot; chords, the principle of &quot;optimum agreement&quot; applies<br/>as above, however when singing with other singers in changing harmonic<br/>contexts there is no fixed drone as a point of reference. The chords &quot;float&quot;<br/>into tune as the singers mutually adjust their pitches into optimum<br/>agreement. The goal is to create a sound in which the individual pitches<br/>virtually disappear into the &quot;homogenized&quot; sonority--or chord color. When<br/>each singer can no longer hear his/her own individual voice, the chord has<br/>&quot;locked.&quot; (Of course, this also involves timbre [vowel color], loudness and<br/>brightness as well as pitch.)</p><p>Hope this helps.

If you use a timbre as harmonically rich as the human<br/>voice, you will find it easy to &quot;lock&quot; at 5:6, 4:5, 3:4, 5:7, 2:3, 5:8, 3:5,<br/>and 4:7. Requiring more attention but still doable are 6:7, 7:9, 7:10, 5:9,<br/>and 6:11. Other ratios in the first octave require more training.</p></div>
