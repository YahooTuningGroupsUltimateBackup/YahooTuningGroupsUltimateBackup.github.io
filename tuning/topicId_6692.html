I didn&apos;t sense he understood what people<br/>on this list refer to as the difference between adaptive and strict JI.  -<br/>of course I might not have the usage correct myself!  Anyhow I have had<br/>another look myself after your recommendations and found your reply and web<br/>page clearer.  I shall try his book also.</p><p>I asked:&gt; Based on available data we can logically infer the relationship<br/>but can<br/>    &gt; we assume that Guido (the supposed inventor of the staff) expected his<br/>    &gt; students to sing in such a way?</p><p>and she replied:</p><p>    From his divisions of the monochord, and information about organ designs<br/>    in this epoch, I would say, &quot;Yes.&quot;</p><p>I located a translation of Guido&apos;s &quot;Micrologus&quot; and he states straight up in<br/>Chapter 1:</p><p>&quot;Let him who seeks our training learn some chants copied in our notation,<br/>let him train his hand in the use of the monchord, and let him<br/>frequently ponder these rules . . . Let us see how science, imitating<br/>nature, has given them [the notes] their separate places thereon.&quot;</p><p>Well, I have a good start.</p><p>Cheers</p><p>Michael Hugh Dixon</p></div>
