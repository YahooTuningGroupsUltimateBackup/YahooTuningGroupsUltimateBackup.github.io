That you can find under Applications-&gt;Utilities. I created a shortcut to Terminal in the dock myself, until I figure out how to create a double-clickable .app file.<br/>So if you can open a terminal, you&apos;ll need to use the command &quot;cd&quot; which stands for &apos;change directory&apos;. For instance:<br/>cd Documents/Chuckk/rationale<br/>if I unzipped to that folder in my Documents folder.</p><p>Once you navigate Terminal to the right folder, try:<br/>python <a href="http://rationale.py">rationale.py</a><br/>&quot;python&quot; is the program needed by the Python programming language, and <a href="http://rationale.py">rationale.py</a> is the main file for Rationale.</p><p>I&apos;ve heard unpromising things for Csound on Intel 10.5; I have 10.4 on Intel, and the guy who compiles most of the OSX Csound packages has, I think, 10.5 on PPC. I know someone who was going to attempt to compile Csound on Intel 10.5, but I haven&apos;t heard how well it went. You might try the 10.4 Intel package:<br/><a href="http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=81968&package_id=120482&release_id=647554">http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=81968&package_id=120482&release_id=647554</a></p><p>In any case, it&apos;s best to install Python 2.5 before installing Csound.

I just learned about 10.5 coming with Python 2.5, that&apos;s good to know.<br/>I&apos;ve given lots of thought to MIDI, but I just don&apos;t know if I can make it work. Each user would want to be able to customize which devices and channels are used on which instruments, etc. Further, Csound as of now only allows one MIDI output device; there&apos;s nothing preventing me from implementing MIDI output outside of Csound, but the problem then is timing- if you have 3 instruments running through Csound and 2 others running through MIDI, it&apos;s hard to make sure the MIDI messages are sent in time with the Csound processing. Probably more productive right now to try to improve Rationale&apos;s Soundfont functionality.</p><p>Glad you have enjoyed the program. Have you explored all of the features? You can hide/show instruments, assign notes to regions of tonality, transpose selected notes by clicking and dragging, edit the available ratios, lots of cool stuff.</p><p>-Chuckk</p><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, Cody Hallenbeck &lt;codyhallenbeck@...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Hi Chuckk,<br/>&gt; I gave up on on compiling Csound on 10.5 when I saw how incredibly<br/>&gt; long it would take to compile all the dependencies.
