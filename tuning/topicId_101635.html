This eventually gives us a 3D system and we can get a 2D &quot;imitation&quot; if we temper out the smallest interval.</p><p>For example, suppose we have &quot;a=4/3, b=5/4, c=6/5&quot; and therefore a*b*c gives us an octave. Since &quot;a&quot; is larger than the other two, we then do either &quot;d=a/c&quot; or &quot;d=a/b&quot;; okay, let&apos;s say we go for the former. So then we might have something like &quot;e=b/d&quot;, then &quot;f=c/e&quot;, then &quot;g=e/d&quot;, and all of a sudden, the octave originally consisting of &quot;a*b*c&quot; is now made of &quot;d^5*f^2*g^3&quot; (i.e. 5 large single-step sizes, 2 small single-step sizes, 3 commas).</p><p>We may notice that our &quot;g&quot; is so small that we can easily temper it out in such a way that two target intervals and their combinations are perfectly in tune. The easiest way of doing this is to multiply both &quot;d&quot; and &quot;f&quot; by &quot;G^(3/7)&quot; as there are 7 first-class steps and 3 commas in our scale. This results in 2/7-comma meantone and both 2/1 and 25/24 will be in tune. If, OTOH, we wish to have, let&apos;s say, 5/2 and 12/5 in tune (which in turn makes 6/1 in tune as well), then we first find the exponents of &quot;d, f, g&quot;; these are &quot;7 2 4&quot; for 5/2 and &quot;6 3 4&quot; for 12/5. Using the method of Gaussian elimination (at least that&apos;s what I think it is), we then get &quot;9 0 4&quot; and &quot;0 9 4&quot;, which says that our &quot;d&quot; and &quot;f&quot; should both be multiplied by &quot;g^(4/9)&quot;. This gives us meantone whose octaves are 1/9-comma sharp and whose major and minor thirds are 1/9-comma flat.</p><p>The most interesting fact about this procedure is that it allows you to very easily discover other 2D temperaments within the originally untempered system of 5-limit JI. For example, if, instead of doing &quot;e=b/d&quot;, we did &quot;e=b/c&quot;, then possible further steps may lead us to completely different results like, for instance, &quot;f=c/d, g=d/f, h=f/e, i=e/h&quot; -- so that &quot;i&quot; is 15625/15552 and if we temper that out, we get hanson with a totally different pattern of &quot;large&quot;  and &quot;small&quot; steps than in meantone.</p><p>Surprisingly enough, when I first used this method in early 2006, my aim at that time was to find temperaments outside the standard 1:2:3:5 framework. So in the beginning, I just checked how the procedure was applicable to meantone and schismatic, and once I knew that, I then started looking for various non-octave or partial-limit temperaments. That&apos;s exactly how I discovered the 2D version of BP which tempers out 245/243 or how I discovered the &quot;triharmonic temperament&quot; where the period is 4/1 and the generator is ~357 cents. Only then did I start looking into the realm of other 5-liit 2D temperaments and only then did I start to understand the actual &quot;incompatibility&quot; of each other and why they weren&apos;t musically interchangeable.</p><p>I think this method must have been known for ages in the context of scales, if not in the context of temperaments. Nevertheless, I haven&apos;t found anything which would support my assumption, nor have I found much discussion about the topic in the &quot;tuning-related&quot; conversations I&apos;ve run across. Does this mean that it hasn&apos;t been given a great deal of attention? And if so, doesn&apos;t it deserve more? There now seem to be at least 4 different methods available for finding 2D temperaments, each of which has its own pros and cons. That doesn&apos;t necessarily mean that some are more effective and others should be forgotten. I myself was able to find some temperaments by using one method and other temperaments by using a different one.</p><p>Petr</p></div><h3>genewardsmith &#x3C;genewardsmith@...&#x3E;</h3><span>9/15/2011 2:36:51 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;petrparizek2000&quot; &lt;petrparizek2000@...&gt; wrote:</p><p>&gt; For example, suppose we have &quot;a=4/3, b=5/4, c=6/5&quot; and therefore a*b*c gives us an octave.

Honestly, I think there could be some other criteria for deciding which of the other factors we should divide by.</p><p>A great example is the chord of 3:5:7:9 where 5/3 is the largest factor and when you divide this by 9/7, the &quot;similarity&quot; of the new result to 9/7 becomes so obvious that you almost instantly start thinking about finding the comma, which you can happily do -- i.e. &quot;a=5/3, b=7/5, c=9/7, d=a/c, e=b/d, f=d/c&quot;. This gives you the BP pentatonic which you can easily extend to the 9-tone diatonic (c/e), or to the 13-tone chromatic (g/e), or even to the 17-tone enharmonic (where the 15625/15309 can serve as a scale step as well).<br/>I usually view it like this:<br/>a|b|c<br/>dc|b|c<br/>dc|ed|c<br/>cfc|ecf|c<br/>gefeg|egef|ge<br/>ehefeeh|eehef|ehe<br/>eieefeeie|eeieef|eiee</p><p>Petr</p></div><h3>petrparizek2000 &#x3C;petrparizek2000@...&#x3E;</h3><span>9/16/2011 4:33:54 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>I wrote:</p><p>&gt; I usually view it like this:<br/>&gt; a|b|c<br/>&gt; dc|b|c<br/>&gt; dc|ed|c<br/>&gt; cfc|ecf|c<br/>&gt; gefeg|egef|ge<br/>&gt; ehefeeh|eehef|ehe<br/>&gt; eieefeeie|eeieef|eiee</p><p>Interestingly enough, when doing it the &quot;usual&quot; way of dividing by the second largest factor, we arrive at a slightly different 13-tone scale which suggests tempering out either 3125/3087 or 16875/16807:</p><p>a|b|c<br/>bd|b|c<br/>ecd|ce|c<br/>edfd|fde|df<br/>egefeg|fege|gef</p><p>Petr</p></div><h3>genewardsmith &#x3C;genewardsmith@...&#x3E;</h3><span>9/16/2011 7:40:32 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;petrparizek2000&quot; &lt;petrparizek2000@...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Gene wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; You should take a look at Brun&apos;s algorithm.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Thanks for the suggestion.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I was trying to find something out there on the web and currently I&apos;m not sure what the difference is between Brun&apos;s algorithm and the &quot;Crunch algorithm&quot; discussed on Tuning Math some time ago.</p><p>Me either, as I can&apos;t read Norwegian, but I&apos;m told it&apos;s pretty much the same thing.</p><p>&gt; Anyway, it looked to me like always dividing the largest factor by the second largest one.</p><p>That was my &quot;crunch&quot; algorithm, yes.</p></div>
