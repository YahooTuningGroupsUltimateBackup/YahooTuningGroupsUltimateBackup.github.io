I played my new CD &quot;Galunlati&quot; for my youngest brother, and he<br/>was visibly overwhelmed by the effect and emotional power of<br/>microtonal scales. To see his reaction was alone worth the 8 months<br/>of effort. He&apos;s a very critical person too, who won&apos;t hesitate to say<br/>if he dislikes something (which I greatly respect) -  but he was<br/>beside himself.</p><p>2.    An African American R&amp;B producer I know, bought a copy of the<br/>CD from me, and returned a few days later with his first microtonal<br/>composition for me to check out. He had got inspired to dig into the<br/>preset scales in his Korg Trinity, and made this lovely little tune<br/>with Hip-Hop beats. I was touched that he was that inspired enough by<br/>the sounds of microtonality, to actually make a tune. A very<br/>interesting experience that showed me that microtonality can make the<br/>leap to pop music without a problem. Who ever doubted anyway? I&apos;ve<br/>always recognized that R&amp;B has allot of melisima in the vocals<br/>anyway - so to adopt microtones to this music would be a natural step<br/>in the direction of African music aesthetics.</p><p>3.    Bill Smith (my wonderfully talented frame drummer friend), gave<br/>a copy of the CD to the Scottish Harpist/Traditional Folk Vocalist in<br/>his Celtic group, and now she wishes to join the creative Tribal<br/>Collective.</p><p>Every day is a Blessing, and what a great time to be alive and making<br/>microtonal music. I&apos;m constantly seeing the signs of how powerful it<br/>can be for folks to hear the new sounds. Keep spreading the word and<br/>the music friends - I think it&apos;s only a matter of time before the<br/>seeds of our labors will grow forth new Trees of Musical Life.</p><p>Thanks,</p><p>Jacky Ligon</p></div><h3><a id=20534 href="#20534">ðŸ”—</a>Jim Cole &#x3C;thejimcole@yahoo.com&#x3E;</h3><span>3/29/2001 6:47:19 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In tuning@y..., ligonj@n... wrote:<br/>&gt; Three amazing things have happened lately which make me realize the<br/>&gt; important emotive, and archetypal nature of our microtonal labors:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; 1.
