My favorite example over the years<br/>&gt;has been the Pythagorean diatonic scale, which is not proper.</p><p>Propriety is the most basic measurement of accousto-scalar effects, the first thing you ask.  It isn&apos;t meant to decide the value of a scale, at least not in so crude a way as these posts seem to assume.</p><p>Propriety also isn&apos;t a property of scales, it is a property of the mental map that a listener uses to extract a certain type of information from an audio stimulus.  Only if you assume that the listener is doing the most efficient extraction possible, and that the stimulus is strictly tuned in the given scale, can you use propriety as a property of the scale.</p><p>Even then it will apply only to sensations that arise from the tracking of scale degrees.  Sensations related to absolute pitch, and any myriad of other things, are an entirely different affair:</p><p>Graham, you say your scales work melodically despite being improper.  Work melodically they might, but this need not include melodic modulation per se, and I hear very little of it in the examples on your web site.  What melodic modulation I do hear, I hear as subsets of a diatonic scale, which is the only map I have learned as a listener.  So my experience jives perfectly with Rothenberg&apos;s theory.</p><p>-C.</p></div><h3>Carl Lumma &#x3C;clumma@nni.com&#x3E;</h3><span>7/2/1999 3:06:40 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>&gt;I have advocated a weaker version of propriety which only enforces the<br/>&gt;non-contradiction between generic size and specific size when it involves<br/>&gt;consonant intervals.</p><p>I like this a lot.

The scale C-D-E/-G-A/-C happens to be very close to<br/>5=.  The scale C-D-E-E/-G-A-A/-C is completely improper, and you have to be<br/>very aware of the inequality of the intervals when you play it.</p><p>I think it&apos;s useful to talk of a &quot;propriety index&quot;.  This is the ratio of<br/>the largest to the smallest atomic interval in the scale.  Atomic intervals<br/>being scale steps, or those intervals that can&apos;t be divided.  In this case,<br/>the largest atomic intervals are A/-C and E/-G.  In just intonation, these<br/>are 7/6 or 267 cents.  The smallest intervals are E-E/ and A-A/, which at<br/>36/35 are 49 cents wide.  That gives the 7-note scale a propriety index of<br/>5.5.  The scale C-D-E/-G-A/-C has an index of 1.3.</p><p>Scales tend to get stranger the higher the propriety index gets.  Neutral<br/>scales have an index of around 1.3, and so sound ambiguous.  This affect can<br/>be lessened by using a non-MOS arrangement.  Pythagorean diatonic scales<br/>have an index slightly over 2.  2 may be the crossover between proper and<br/>improper, although I don&apos;t think it&apos;s as simple as that.  Anyway,<br/>Pythagorean scales are good melodically.  Perhaps the strongest melodic<br/>scales have an index between 2 and 2.5.  5.5 is probably as high as you can<br/>push it before the scale becomes incomprehensible.  Sure enough, a 10-note<br/>major-third MOS scale with an index of 8 is fairly uninteresting.  I think<br/>the high index points to this.  Such a high propriety index signifies a<br/>dysfunctional scale.  But this is a long way from saying that impropriety<br/>itself is a bad thing.  Although nobody is saying that any more.</p><p>Another thing with my scale above is that, although the largest atomic<br/>intervals are much bigger then the smallest intervals, there are plenty of<br/>intermediate intervals.  I think this is good when the propriety index gets<br/>so high, although it contradicts the idea that scales should only have two<br/>different atomic intervals.</p></div><h3>Carl Lumma &#x3C;clumma@xxx.xxxx&#x3E;</h3><span>7/5/1999 8:50:11 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>&gt;How about the idea that every consonant interval is always subtended by the &gt;same number of scale degrees?
