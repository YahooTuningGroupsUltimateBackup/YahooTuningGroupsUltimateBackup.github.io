Graham dealt with this here in primerr.pdf</p><p><a href="http://www.x31eq.com/primerr.pdf">http://www.x31eq.com/primerr.pdf</a></p><p>The simplest approach is to treat all prime errors<br/>equally. This gives unreasonable results in practice.<br/>For example, the intervals 2:1 and 7:1 are counted on<br/>an equal footing, so an error of 1 cent in 2:1 is treated<br/>as badly as an error of 1 cent in 7:1. But the error<br/>in 8:1 has to be three times as big as the error in 2:1<br/>for any regular temperament. So 8:1 is allowed to be<br/>three times as out of tune as 7:1 when it&rsquo;s only a little<br/>bit bigger! To give more &fllig;exibility, each prime error is<br/>given a different weighting when calculating the over-<br/>all error for a <a href="http://temperament.In">temperament.In</a> many cases it&rsquo;s certainly not appropriate to give<br/>complex intervals a higher weight. You may decide<br/>that more complex intervals are harder to hear, and<br/>so must be tuned more precisely to help the ear. But<br/>in that case you must consider a &filig;nite set of intervals.<br/>Unbounded prime-limit errors will end up being deter-<br/>mined by the in&filig;nite number of in&filig;nitely complex &ndash;<br/>and therefore completely meaningless &ndash; ratios.</p><p>So scratch my iTOP idea. It&apos;ll definitely require a bit more thinking than that.</p><p>BTW, you should join tuning-math if you want to just discuss math and<br/>not argue over music cognition anymore.</p><p>-Mike</p></div><h3>genewardsmith &#x3C;genewardsmith@...&#x3E;</h3><span>1/16/2012 1:33:53 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, Mike Battaglia &lt;battaglia01@...&gt; wrote:</p><p>&gt; The simplest approach is to treat all prime errors<br/>&gt; equally.
