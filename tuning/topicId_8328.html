I have assumed something tending toward meantone above (since these are optimum for diatonic). For tunings tending toward (or beyond) the Pythagorean, B:F would be closer to 5:7 which one might then call a &quot;Pythagorean diminished fifth&quot;, or (as I&apos;d prefer) a &quot;subdiminished fifth&quot;.</p><p>&gt;Remember, Paul and Joe hold that &quot;context is everything.&quot;</p><p>It&apos;s certainly very important, and the system, as explained on my web page, <a href="http://uq.net.au/~zzdkeena/Music/IntervalNaming.htm">http://uq.net.au/~zzdkeena/Music/IntervalNaming.htm</a> allows for alternative names for the same ratio in different contexts, as with 5:7 = aug 4th = subdim 5th above.</p><p>&gt;(You don&apos;t suppose Mr. Fokker would reconsider these, do you?</p><p>No.</p><p>&gt; Too late, you say?</p><p>As in &quot;the late Mr Fokker&quot;, yes.</p><p>&gt;Okay. Do you suppose he&apos;d mind if we messed with it a bit?)</p><p>Yes. The whole system would be screwed if we swapped these two. To be fair to Mr Fokker, strictly speaking, he gave the names to the intervals of 31-tET (a meantone), not to the JI ratios which they approximate. The latter seems like an obvious move to many people, but I understand that Paul Erlich is still dubious about it because of the apparent disagreement, in the case of 22-tET (and other super-Pythagorean tunings), between the A-G, #, b, /, \ names for the notes, based on chains of approximate 2:3&apos;s, and the Fokker-style names for the intervals, based on the 11-limit ratios most nearly approximated.</p><p>22-tET intervals from C to:</p><p>C   perfect unison<br/>C/  super unison<br/>Db/ minor second<br/>D\  neutral second<br/>D   major second, supermajor second<br/>Eb  subminor third<br/>Eb/ minor third, neutral third<br/>E\  major third<br/>E   supermajor third<br/>F   perfect fourth<br/>F/  super fourth<br/>F#\, Gb/  augmented fourth, diminished fifth<br/>G\  sub fifth<br/>G   perfect fifth<br/>Ab  subminor sixth<br/>Ab/ minor sixth<br/>A\  neutral sixth, major sixth<br/>A   supermajor sixth<br/>Bb  subminor seventh, minor seventh<br/>Bb/ neutral seventh<br/>B\  major seventh<br/>C\  sub octave<br/>C   perfect octave</p><p>Personally, I don&apos;t have a problem with that.

Although 22-tET is consistent with the set of<br/>11-limit ratios, it is not consistent with conventional diatonic<br/>nomenclature, because the syntonic comma does not vanish. In your scheme,<br/>the interval between the &quot;major second&quot; and the &quot;major sixth&quot; is not a<br/>&quot;perfect fifth&quot; but a &quot;sub fifth&quot;. I find that screwy. If you don&apos;t, at<br/>least you&apos;re in good company -- Ben Johnston&apos;s JI notation of C major is<br/>similar.</p></div>
