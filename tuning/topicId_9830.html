Any<br/>&gt;&gt;evidence to the contrary?</p><p>Dale replied,</p><p>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Bull&apos;s piece has a big fat a-flat major triad in root position<br/>at the beginning of the 7th entry of the hexachord.  The triad is<br/>complete, i.e. all 3 notes are present.  Later there&apos;s a complete<br/>a-flat major triad in 1st inversion.  The &apos;cadence&apos; of this entry is<br/>also an a-flat major chord, but without the e-flat.  The passgae<br/>also includes at least one d-flat major triad, a b-flat minor triad,<br/>an f-minor seventh triad (w/ e-flat).</p><p>Sounds like the piece uses a gamut from d-flat to f-sharp. There have been<br/>many references on this list to Renaissance composers expecting the<br/>keyboardist to retune anew for each piece. Nothing indicating a<br/>non-meantone, circulating 12-tone temperament here (as far as I can see . .<br/>.)</p></div>
