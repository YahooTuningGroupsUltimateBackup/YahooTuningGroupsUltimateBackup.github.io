Bad?  For what?</p><p>Well.....frankly, for 4:3.  I confess I&apos;ve tended to interpret generic intervals<br/>in terms of smallest numbers; and while it may not be just (heheh) for one<br/>to think of 27:20 as a &quot;4:3 too wide by a syntonic comma,&quot; I think there&apos;s<br/>probably at least somewhat of a psychoacoustical basis for doing so, and<br/>of course there&apos;s a cultural basis for doing it, since the omnipresent 12-tET<br/>represents both 4:3 and 27:20 by a single interval which is much closer to<br/>the former than it is to the latter.</p><p>However, I&apos;m certainly open to _any_ interval, 27:20 included, being<br/>considered as distinct and viable in its own right.  I&apos;m grateful to have had<br/>my ears opened to my own prejudice (commaphobia?), because it brings up<br/>a notion I&apos;ve never really considered before, that of two opposing schools of<br/>thought: one, in which the comma is feared, hidden, made to disappear; and<br/>another, in which it is embraced and celebrated, or, at the very least, accepted<br/>without judgment as a part of a &quot;value-free acoustics.&quot;</p><p>Now, I must go away and ponder these things.</p><p>Dale Scott</p></div>
