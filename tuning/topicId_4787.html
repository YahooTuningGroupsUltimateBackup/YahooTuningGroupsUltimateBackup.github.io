It is painfully<br/>frustrating to navigate a keyboard that has any interval other than the octave<br/>sounding when a pair of keys are pressed that look like an octave apart -- in<br/>other words: when I tune my synth to 19-TET then press what looks like a pair<br/>of C notes twelve keys apart, I hear an interval much smaller than an octave.<br/>The brain-ache comes when trying to remember where each octave of a given note<br/>occurs along the full width of the keyboard as they are all different.</p><p>The benefit of an equal temperament as I see it (?? hear it ??) is that<br/>melodies and chords can be played in any key, enabling creative use of<br/>modulation in our compositions. Even though pure harmony can only be<br/>approximated with an ET, sometimes this compromise is worth tolerating for the<br/>benefits I mentioned. Equal temperaments work brilliantly on fretted<br/>instruments for two reasons: firstly, there is no need to restrict the number<br/>of notes as with a keyboard; and secondly, the spacing of intervals remains<br/>unchanged -- it feels fairly normal to play.</p><p>What I don&apos;t understand is why a musician would restrict themselves to 12 or<br/>less pitches selected from an equal temperament. I have read numerous posts on<br/>this list describing this practice, most recently 11 from 31-TET. Why choose a<br/>subset from within something that was compromised to start with? Why not select<br/>11 pitches according to just intonation? You will get pure harmony rather than<br/>approximations of it. Does this not make more sense seeing as the benefit of<br/>creative modulation has been lost by discarding some of the equally tempered<br/>pitches?</p><p>DARREN McDOUGALL</p></div><h3>D.Stearns &#x3C;stearns@xxxxxxx.xxxx&#x3E;</h3><span>9/13/1999 1:42:27 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>[McDougall, Darren Scott:]<br/>&gt; What I don&apos;t understand is why a musician would restrict themselves<br/>to 12 or less pitches selected from an equal temperament.

For example, meantone temperament is a compromise which has some<br/>benefits over just intonation -- more notes can be made consonant with one<br/>another than in JI (for example, the diatonic scale in meantone has 6<br/>consonant triads, while a JI version can have at most 5). 31-tET is an<br/>excellent approximation of meantone, so choosing subsets of 31-tET is kind<br/>of like choosing subsets of meantone. I agree that once you&apos;re choosing a<br/>subset, 31-equal is not necessarily the ideal superset. But since any good<br/>meantone will do, it&apos;s convenient to describe the subset in terms of<br/>31-equal. Likewise for some of the subsets of 22-tET I&apos;ve discussed.</p><p>I&apos;d be happy to elaborate on any of this if it unclear.</p><p>-Paul Erlich</p></div><h3>Paul H.

I<br/>showed how one could not put all the tones in JI and still preserve all the<br/>consonant relationships in the scale. It is much like the case with the<br/>diatonic scale, but here there were even more interrelationships and<br/>concords through the 7-limit.</p></div>
