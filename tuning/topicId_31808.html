Since<br/>the vast majority of musicians, including Partch, think of pitch-<br/>names in octave-invariant terms, then the concept of &quot;interval<br/>classes&quot; (widespread in mainstream 20th century music theory, by the<br/>way) becomes a very important one. Hence a rating of interval classes<br/>by consonance becomes an interesting exercise -- for example if you<br/>wish to design a scale which repeats itself exactly every octave,<br/>then you can just use this kind of consonance measure for the pairs<br/>of notes within one octave, rather than the much more complex<br/>enterprise of using a &quot;true&quot; consonance measure for every pair of<br/>notes within the audible range.</p><p>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Best Regards,  J Gill</p></div>
