I&apos;ve been away a while.  Mainly working with<br/>an essentially 12-tet rock band &quot;Darktown Saints&quot;<br/>(<a href="http://www.darktownsaints.com">www.darktownsaints.com</a>) but on the more interesting side the<br/>band is also a barbershop quartet.  Anyway, I&apos;ve gained a lot of<br/>insight into things lately and I wanted to pose a question.</p><p>I&apos;ve read Helmlholtz, Partch, Danielou, Mathieu, Jeans,<br/>Blackwood, Doty, Catler, Lou Harrison, and I just finished Bill<br/>Sethares new 2nd edition of Tuning Timbre Spectrum Scale.  I<br/>also have a music degree and studied classical theory.  Still, I<br/>haven&apos;t come to get a solid idea of what drives the concept of<br/>&quot;scale.&quot;</p><p>I know about tetrachord theory and I undertand the observation<br/>that nearly all music cultures function around a more or less<br/>defined &quot;scale&quot; or multiple scales.  I&apos;m aware of theories as to<br/>various scale&apos;s origins as far as tuning goes.  And I understand<br/>the simple concept of continuity such that once a sound or tuning<br/>is established it tends to stabalize to the listener such that any<br/>new or altered sound will increase interest or tension.</p><p>Still this doesn&apos;t explain the predominance of 7 or 5 note scales.<br/>More significantly I don&apos;t have an explanation as to WHY scales<br/>are so powerful.  As much as theory explains THAT a particular<br/>state exists of the use of scales is clear.  What is the driving<br/>force behind scales?  Am I missing something?  Is it related to<br/>numbers in the range of 5-8 items being more easily withing the<br/>human capacity to concieve of at once?  Does the general<br/>chromaticism of scales have a major impact? (meaning that the<br/>scale can somewhat simulate a sliding up or down pitch vs. a<br/>strange scale like C-C#-D-E-F-F#-B would not because of the<br/>leap from F#-B)  Obviously there are cultural norms that make<br/>studies harder to do objectively, but could we establish 3 or 4<br/>note scales and then provide musical interest through<br/>modulation?  Or if we try a 12 or 15 or more note scale can it<br/>really be established as a scale or will the perception be that of<br/>constant modulation or confusion?</p><p>I guess I&apos;m mainly hoping to get at understanding some<br/>psychoacoustic effect or something that explains perception of<br/>&quot;scale&quot; in addition to the practical reasons scales developed and<br/>the simple discussion of what does or doesn&apos;t currently exist in<br/>the world&apos;s musics.

So a related question: is pitch memory<br/>supporting &quot;scales&quot; due to the harmonic effects of the scale even<br/>when seperated as melody or does pitch memory guide people<br/>towards a sense of scale even (hypothetically) if we could not<br/>percieve harmonic relations by memory?</p><p>-Aaron Wolf<br/><a href="http://www.darktownsaints.com">www.darktownsaints.com</a></p></div><h3>jjensen142000 &#x3C;jjensen14@hotmail.com&#x3E;</h3><span>1/15/2005 2:46:38 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;backfromthesilo&quot;<br/>&lt;backfromthesilo@y...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;</p><p>&gt; I&apos;ve read Helmlholtz, Partch, Danielou, Mathieu, Jeans,<br/>&gt; Blackwood, Doty, Catler, Lou Harrison, and I just finished Bill<br/>&gt; Sethares new 2nd edition of Tuning Timbre Spectrum Scale.

The implication would be that<br/>the idea of scale is just based on cultural familiarity.  I guess I&apos;m<br/>wondering again if the answer is really that simple.</p><p>&gt; &gt; Does the general<br/>&gt; &gt; chromaticism of scales have a major impact? (meaning that<br/>the<br/>&gt; &gt; scale can somewhat simulate a sliding up or down pitch vs.<br/>a<br/>&gt; &gt; strange scale like C-C#-D-E-F-F#-B would not because of<br/>the<br/>&gt; &gt; leap from F#-B)<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; If by scale you mean these are the only allowable notes, then<br/>&gt; I don&apos;t see why you couldn&apos;t make melodies with only those<br/>&gt; notes, but your harmony is what would have problems.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;</p><p>Well, I&apos;m kinda asking if the ability of a set scale to simulate a<br/>smoothly rising or lowering pitch has an impact on its likelihood<br/>of being used or feel natural.  Without considering harmony, or<br/>actual cultural norms, maybe universal psychoacoustics give<br/>favor to relatively more equal scales.  Even though whole and<br/>half steps are quite different, the major scale still rises and falls<br/>much more smoothly than that hypothetical scale I mention for<br/>example.</p><p>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; I guess I&apos;m mainly hoping to get at understanding some<br/>&gt; &gt; psychoacoustic effect or something that explains perception<br/>of<br/>&gt; &gt; &quot;scale&quot; in addition to the practical reasons scales developed<br/>and<br/>&gt; &gt; the simple discussion of what does or doesn&apos;t currently exist<br/>in<br/>&gt; &gt; the world&apos;s musics.

Otherwise no. But I think there are psycho-acoustical<br/>&gt; reasons why they would tend to stick to a definite set of<br/>&gt; pitches, or evolve to that over time.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;</p><p>Ok, now we&apos;re getting at it.  What do people think?  Are there<br/>such psycho-acoustic reasons?  What are they?  How do they<br/>work?  How much is related to language?  How much is<br/>universal vs. contextual?</p><p>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; One thought:  A friend came up with the analogy of &quot;digital&quot;<br/>vs.<br/>&gt; &gt; &quot;analog&quot; that perhaps melody can be thought of more as<br/>analog<br/>&gt; &gt; in that the driving force of melody is pitch moving up or down<br/>with<br/>&gt; &gt; no particular points, whereas harmony has points of<br/>&gt; &gt; consonance or dissonance that are more or less defined-<br/>&gt; &gt; &quot;digital.&quot;  And perhaps every other parameter of what we call<br/>&gt; &gt; &quot;melody&quot; is actually rhythmic effects or *harmonic* effects<br/>that<br/>&gt; &gt; are due to pitch memory.

Would a hypothetical person who grew up in a society where the only<br/>music was unaccompanied singing and harmonization absent still percieve of<br/>their songs as ordered by some sort of &quot;scale?&quot;<br/>Plenty of questions! :-)  I&apos;d like to offer my ideas - based only on my<br/>experience and (unsystematic) thinking over many years.  That is, I have no<br/>grand unified theory that &quot;explains&quot; scales, certainly not scientifically.<br/>Perhaps that&apos;s what you&apos;re looking for, when you ask for a possible<br/>explanation in terms of  &apos;some psychoacoustic effect or something that<br/>explains perception of &quot;scale&quot;&apos;?  But I too have read Helmholtz and Ellis,<br/>also Shankar on the sruti system of north Indian music, and have been<br/>composing music for decades, so may have some insight you could use.  I&apos;ll<br/>repeat your questions and offer my answers for your consideration.<br/>  ... I haven&apos;t come to get a solid idea of what drives the concept of<br/>&quot;scale.&quot;<br/>  [YA]  All melody comes from the human voice.  It begins in expressive<br/>vocalisation, and can encompass any use of the voice, whether shouting,<br/>speaking or singing.  The basic notion of a tetrachord is not that of four<br/>strings tuned in step interval; it is that of a natural speaking range for a<br/>human voice.  The scale is the ladder, or set of steps, we have likened our<br/>natural pitch variations in speech to, codified, simplified, abstracted.  We<br/>raise our speaking pitch from its base level with emotion or to question.<br/>We lower our speaking pitch for emphasis, finality, or command.  Three or<br/>four notes cover the general speech of most of us in our daily<br/>conversations.</p><p>  When I speak of &quot;natural range&quot;, of course I&apos;m oversimplifying.  The<br/>speaking ranges we find appropriate for men and women, boys and girls, are<br/>largely influenced by culture as well as the physiology of the larynx.<br/>  Putting two tetrachords together comes much later!  It&apos;s analogous to<br/>having one voice that combines the natural speaking range of two different<br/>voices.  It&apos;s an artifice.  A good singer has a better vocal range than a<br/>poor one - why? because he or she has a better emotional range available to<br/>express.<br/>  Looking at the history of western harmony, we find unison singing giving<br/>way to organum - where men&apos;s and boys&apos; voices sing in parallel fourths,<br/>fifths or octaves - long before the acceptance of those incredibly dissonant<br/>intervals, the thirds :-).  What is happening here?  Men and boys are<br/>singing in the natural (ie culturally appropriate) ranges, but singing the<br/>same melody.</p><p>  ... What is the driving force behind scales?  Am I missing something?</p><p>  [YA]  I believe the driving force behind scales is the expressiveness of<br/>the human voice speaking in its culturally appropriate range, enriched by<br/>the idea of someone able to speak with, effectively, many voices, by adding<br/>one range on top of another.</p><p>  ... Is it related to numbers in the range of 5-8 items being more easily<br/>within the human capacity to conceive of at once?</p><p>  [YA]  Simple systems are certainly more easily grasped, learned,<br/>remembered and promulgated.  Our short-term memory has a limit of about<br/>seven - or, as you say, 5-8 - items, and surely this is relevant to grasping<br/>a melody - you can only relate the current note to those you can keep in<br/>memory.  But hte fact that there are few notes in most practical scales<br/>comes, I think, from the fact that there are few notes in each natural<br/>speaking range.</p><p>  ...  Does the general chromaticism of scales have a major impact?</p><p>  [YA]  We don&apos;t speak in octaves, do we?  We speak in steps, glides, bends<br/>and microtones!  But we only hear a few distinct pitch levels as being<br/>significant.  Let me draw an analogy to the production of different speech<br/>sounds; you or I might pronounce our /r/s differently; yours might roll,<br/>while mine flaps, but we recognise both sounds (allophones) as members of<br/>the same sound class or phoneme /r/.  In like manner, when Mother calls us<br/>for dinner, you and I might answer &quot;Coming!&quot; with different micro melodies,<br/>or on different pitches; but relative to our own normal vocies, we both<br/>answer in the &quot;affirmative response&quot; pitch - and are understood as such.  We<br/>might call these allopitches of one pitcheme.</p><p>  ... could we establish 3 or 4 note scales and then provide musical<br/>interest through<br/>  modulation?</p><p>  [YA]  Sure, you can establish a 3 or 4 note scale; try this one: C Db E F;<br/>and then provide musical interest through many musical techniques - rhythmic<br/>variation, by stretching or compressing a melody note lengths by a factor of<br/>2, 3 or 4; by interval inversion; by retrograde motion (all standard<br/>contrapuntal techniques); or by adding a fixed or variable amount to each<br/>note length (&iuml;&iquest;&half; la Olivier Messiaen); or by serialisation (&iuml;&iquest;&half; la Arnold<br/>Schoenberg and his followers); to name a few!</p><p>  It&apos;s a useful exercise for any composer to write music with restricted<br/>tools - limiting the scale to a subset of the usual notes opens up more<br/>possiblities, I think, than it closes.  Try writing in pentatonic scales; in<br/>modes (you probably do &quot;guitar modes&quot; in the rock band, don&apos;t you?); then<br/>try dropping one more note from your pentatone and seeing how to make the<br/>music interesting.</p><p>  ... Or if we try a 12 or 15 or more note scale can it really be<br/>established as a scale or will the perception be that of constant modulation<br/>or confusion?</p><p>  [YA]  Schoenberg et al used a 12-TET scale, with surprisingly unconfusing<br/>results.  So did the late romantics, in all but name - Wagner, Richard<br/>Strauss, Mahler, Liszt all wrote works so chromatic that you could not<br/>justify the &quot;return&quot; to any particular tone centre.</p><p>  ... I guess I&apos;m mainly hoping to get at understanding some psychoacoustic<br/>effect or something that explains perception of &quot;scale&quot; in addition to the<br/>practical reasons scales developed and the simple discussion of what does or<br/>doesn&apos;t currently exist in the world&apos;s musics.<br/>  [YA]  Well, I guess I&apos;ve focussed on the hypothetical ealrist practical<br/>reasons scales developed.  But I&apos;d say that the emotional force of those<br/>reasons is not spent; by and large, they still drive our response to music,<br/>as wordless expressions of the emotions that our voices can convey.</p><p>  ...  Would a hypothetical person who grew up in a society where the only<br/>music was unaccompanied singing and harmonization absent still percieve of<br/>their songs as ordered by some sort of &quot;scale?&quot;</p><p>  [YA]  What&apos;s hypothetical about it?  Most people thru history have grown<br/>up without harmonisation in the western sense.  Most people born today will<br/>certainly grow up with it.  However, all the singers of yore sang using<br/>scales.  I&apos;d say it was a very hard notion to abolish ...<br/>Regards,<br/>Yahya</p><p>--<br/>Internal Virus Database is out-of-date.<br/>Checked by AVG Anti-Virus.<br/>Version: 7.0.300 / Virus Database: 265.6.10 - Release Date: 10/1/05</p></div><h3>Carl Lumma &#x3C;ekin@lumma.org&#x3E;</h3><span>1/16/2005 11:37:56 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>&gt;&gt; To my way of thinking, a scale is not the primary object, but<br/>&gt;&gt; a secondary effect.

Much of this is done using the same sort of<br/>processing that is used in language.  There are clearly universal<br/>tendencies governed by biology, but other than that most of the<br/>details of a particular school or genre or area are cultural/accidental.</p><p>&gt;&gt; &gt; And perhaps every other parameter of what we call<br/>&gt;&gt; &gt; &quot;melody&quot; is actually rhythmic effects or *harmonic* effects<br/>&gt;&gt; &gt; that are due to pitch memory.</p><p>That&apos;s one neat way to think about it.</p><p>&gt;&gt; &gt; So a related question: is pitch memory<br/>&gt;&gt; &gt; supporting &quot;scales&quot; due to the harmonic effects of the scale<br/>&gt;&gt; &gt; even when seperated as melody or does pitch memory guide<br/>&gt;&gt; &gt; people towards a sense of scale even (hypothetically) if we<br/>&gt;&gt; &gt; could not percieve harmonic relations by memory?<br/>&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt; I&apos;d vote for the former.</p><p>There are several mechanisms at play in melodic perception.  All<br/>of them depend on events referencing other events in time, but<br/>not all of them involve harmony in the western sense.  Different<br/>aspects of melodic perception may be dominant in different<br/>listeners.</p><p>&gt;So in this sense, you&apos;re going back to saying that scale is a<br/>&gt;byproduct rather than an effect of its own.  I don&apos;t really disagree<br/>&gt;strongly, I just don&apos;t want to jump to conclusions.  I suppose I&apos;m<br/>&gt;looking to be able to say that the origin of &quot;scale&quot; is dependant<br/>&gt;on a specific list of phenomena that come back to<br/>&gt;psycho-acoustics.  Then it could be determined what aspects of<br/>&gt;scale are potentially universal vs. contextual.</p><p>Scales are largely a theoretical convenience.  Though curiously,<br/>very few of them have more than 7 tones per octave.</p><p>&gt;To acknowledge the bias in my thinking, I&apos;m wishing there was a<br/>&gt;universal psychoacoustical explanation for scale such that I<br/>&gt;could teach things as they relate to scale without constant<br/>&gt;prefacing that scale is actually just a byproduct or that it just<br/>&gt;happens to be the way western music is at the moment (since it<br/>&gt;SEEMS more universal than that),</p><p>I&apos;m not sure I see any problem.  When you say &quot;scale,&quot; what do<br/>you mean?  The diatonic scale?  It is by no means unique to<br/>Western music, but it was employed in novel ways in the West.</p><p>Obviously everything is a byproduct of some underlying reason,<br/>if you&apos;re a reductionist.</p><p>&gt;or without doing what everyone else does, which is to completely<br/>&gt;ignore physical realities of tuning and harmonics and beats etc.<br/>&gt;I&apos;m also interested in such an explanation for myself too.</p><p>Just because there is some common perception among people governed<br/>by our common biology doesn&apos;t mean music must always interact with<br/>that perception in the same way.  If I write dissonant music, is<br/>there any reason to say I have used the common perception of beats<br/>any less sincerely than harmonious music?</p><p>-Carl</p></div><h3>Ozan Yarman &#x3C;ozanyarman@superonline.com&#x3E;</h3><span>1/16/2005 7:15:31 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>If I might be allowed to interject, my natural speaking voice leaps regularly in one octave!

Would a hypothetical person who grew up in a society where the only music was unaccompanied singing and harmonization absent still percieve of their songs as ordered by some sort of &quot;scale?&quot;</p><p>Plenty of questions! :-)  I&apos;d like to offer my ideas - based only on my experience and (unsystematic) thinking over many years.  That is, I have no grand unified theory that &quot;explains&quot; scales, certainly not scientifically.  Perhaps that&apos;s what you&apos;re looking for, when you ask for a possible explanation in terms of  &apos;some psychoacoustic effect or something that explains perception of &quot;scale&quot;&apos;?  But I too have read Helmholtz and Ellis, also Shankar on the sruti system of north Indian music, and have been composing music for decades, so may have some insight you could use.  I&apos;ll repeat your questions and offer my answers for your consideration.</p><p>&#x9;... I haven&apos;t come to get a solid idea of what drives the concept of &quot;scale.&quot;</p><p>&#x9;[YA]  All melody comes from the human voice.  It begins in expressive vocalisation, and can encompass any use of the voice, whether shouting, speaking or singing.  The basic notion of a tetrachord is not that of four strings tuned in step interval; it is that of a natural speaking range for a human voice.  The scale is the ladder, or set of steps, we have likened our natural pitch variations in speech to, codified, simplified, abstracted.  We raise our speaking pitch from its base level with emotion or to question.  We lower our speaking pitch for emphasis, finality, or command.  Three or four notes cover the general speech of most of us in our daily conversations.</p><p>&#x9;When I speak of &quot;natural range&quot;, of course I&apos;m oversimplifying.  The speaking ranges we find appropriate for men and women, boys and girls, are largely influenced by culture as well as the physiology of the larynx.</p><p>&#x9;Putting two tetrachords together comes much later!  It&apos;s analogous to having one voice that combines the natural speaking range of two different voices.  It&apos;s an artifice.  A good singer has a better vocal range than a poor one - why? because he or she has a better emotional range available to express.</p><p>&#x9;Looking at the history of western harmony, we find unison singing giving way to organum - where men&apos;s and boys&apos; voices sing in parallel fourths, fifths or octaves - long before the acceptance of those incredibly dissonant intervals, the thirds :-).  What is happening here?  Men and boys are singing in the natural (ie culturally appropriate) ranges, but singing the same melody.</p><p>&#x9;... What is the driving force behind scales?  Am I missing something?</p><p>&#x9;[YA]  I believe the driving force behind scales is the expressiveness of the human voice speaking in its culturally appropriate range, enriched by the idea of someone able to speak with, effectively, many voices, by adding one range on top of another.</p><p>&#x9;... Is it related to numbers in the range of 5-8 items being more easily within the human capacity to conceive of at once?</p><p>&#x9;[YA]  Simple systems are certainly more easily grasped, learned, remembered and promulgated.  Our short-term memory has a limit of about seven - or, as you say, 5-8 - items, and surely this is relevant to grasping a melody - you can only relate the current note to those you can keep in memory.  But hte fact that there are few notes in most practical scales comes, I think, from the fact that there are few notes in each natural speaking range.</p><p>&#x9;...  Does the general chromaticism of scales have a major impact?</p><p>&#x9;[YA]  We don&apos;t speak in octaves, do we?  We speak in steps, glides, bends and microtones!  But we only hear a few distinct pitch levels as being significant.  Let me draw an analogy to the production of different speech sounds; you or I might pronounce our /r/s differently; yours might roll, while mine flaps, but we recognise both sounds (allophones) as members of the same sound class or phoneme /r/.  In like manner, when Mother calls us for dinner, you and I might answer &quot;Coming!&quot; with different micro melodies, or on different pitches; but relative to our own normal vocies, we both answer in the &quot;affirmative response&quot; pitch - and are understood as such.  We might call these allopitches of one pitcheme.</p><p>&#x9;... could we establish 3 or 4 note scales and then provide musical interest through<br/>&#x9;modulation?</p><p>&#x9;[YA]  Sure, you can establish a 3 or 4 note scale; try this one: C Db E F; and then provide musical interest through many musical techniques - rhythmic variation, by stretching or compressing a melody note lengths by a factor of 2, 3 or 4; by interval inversion; by retrograde motion (all standard contrapuntal techniques); or by adding a fixed or variable amount to each note length (&agrave; la Olivier Messiaen); or by serialisation (&agrave; la Arnold Schoenberg and his followers); to name a few!</p><p>&#x9;It&apos;s a useful exercise for any composer to write music with restricted tools - limiting the scale to a subset of the usual notes opens up more possiblities, I think, than it closes.  Try writing in pentatonic scales; in modes (you probably do &quot;guitar modes&quot; in the rock band, don&apos;t you?); then try dropping one more note from your pentatone and seeing how to make the music interesting.</p><p>&#x9;... Or if we try a 12 or 15 or more note scale can it really be established as a scale or will the perception be that of constant modulation or confusion?</p><p>&#x9;[YA]  Schoenberg et al used a 12-TET scale, with surprisingly unconfusing results.  So did the late romantics, in all but name - Wagner, Richard Strauss, Mahler, Liszt all wrote works so chromatic that you could not justify the &quot;return&quot; to any particular tone centre.</p><p>&#x9;... I guess I&apos;m mainly hoping to get at understanding some psychoacoustic effect or something that explains perception of &quot;scale&quot; in addition to the practical reasons scales developed and the simple discussion of what does or doesn&apos;t currently exist in the world&apos;s musics.</p><p>&#x9;[YA]  Well, I guess I&apos;ve focussed on the hypothetical ealrist practical reasons scales developed.  But I&apos;d say that the emotional force of those reasons is not spent; by and large, they still drive our response to music, as wordless expressions of the emotions that our voices can convey.</p><p>&#x9;...  Would a hypothetical person who grew up in a society where the only music was unaccompanied singing and harmonization absent still percieve of their songs as ordered by some sort of &quot;scale?&quot;</p><p>&#x9;[YA]  What&apos;s hypothetical about it?  Most people thru history have grown up without harmonisation in the western sense.  Most people born today will certainly grow up with it.  However, all the singers of yore sang using scales.  I&apos;d say it was a very hard notion to abolish ...</p><p>Regards,</p><p>Yahya</p><p>You can configure your subscription by sending an empty email to one<br/>of these addresses (from the address at which you receive the list):<br/>  <a href="mailto:tuning-subscribe@yahoogroups.com">tuning-subscribe@yahoogroups.com</a> - join the tuning group.<br/>  <a href="mailto:tuning-unsubscribe@yahoogroups.com">tuning-unsubscribe@yahoogroups.com</a> - leave the group.<br/>  <a href="mailto:tuning-nomail@yahoogroups.com">tuning-nomail@yahoogroups.com</a> - turn off mail from the group.<br/>  <a href="mailto:tuning-digest@yahoogroups.com">tuning-digest@yahoogroups.com</a> - set group to send daily digests.<br/>  <a href="mailto:tuning-normal@yahoogroups.com">tuning-normal@yahoogroups.com</a> - set group to send individual emails.<br/>  <a href="mailto:tuning-help@yahoogroups.com">tuning-help@yahoogroups.com</a> - receive general help information.</p><p>________________________________</p><p>Yahoo!

The basic<br/>notion of a tetrachord is not that of four strings tuned in step<br/>interval; it is that of a natural speaking range for a human voice.<br/>The scale is the ladder, or set of steps, we have likened our<br/>natural pitch variations in speech to, codified, simplified,<br/>abstracted.</p><p>-Yes, I&apos;m familiar with this idea in general, but this is a more<br/>specific view.  So some follow up questions- what actually is the<br/>general tessitura of a natural speaking voice?  Is it really about a<br/>4/3 interval or is that an approximation made due to harmonic<br/>relations?  Second, would it be fair to say that seperating the 4/3<br/>into four parts is analogous to specifying 5 vowels (as some<br/>languages only specify though there exists a continuous<br/>possible spectrum of vowel sounds)?  Do cultures that use<br/>fewer scale notes also have languages with less specificity of<br/>meaning between subtly changes in pitch and vice versa?  In a<br/>related sense, would a note between two established scale<br/>tones have a similarly confused impression on a listener as<br/>hearing an in-between vowel sound?</p><p>&gt;   [YA]  Our short-term memory has a limit of about seven - or,<br/>as you say, 5-8 - items, and surely this is relevant to grasping a<br/>melody - you can only relate the current note to those you can<br/>keep in memory.  But the fact that there are few notes in most<br/>practical scales comes, I think, from the fact that there are few<br/>notes in each natural speaking range.</p><p>-So you&apos;re saying the capacity of short term memory may be a<br/>factor but your feeling is against that notion?</p><p>&gt;   ...  Does the general chromaticism of scales have a major<br/>impact?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;   [YA]  We don&apos;t speak in octaves, do we?  We speak in steps,<br/>glides, bends and microtones!  But we only hear a few distinct<br/>pitch levels as being significant.  Let me draw an analogy to the<br/>production of different speech sounds; you or I might pronounce<br/>our /r/s differently; yours might roll, while mine flaps, but we<br/>recognise both sounds (allophones) as members of the same<br/>sound class or phoneme /r/.</p><p>-well this is like my vowel analogy above, but by chromaticism, I<br/>mean to ask is there a natural push towards more evenly<br/>spaced intervals which might better approximate the glides of<br/>speech vs. less evenly spaced intervals?</p><p>Overall, it sounds like your thinking is that most aspects of even<br/>(supposedly) absolute music are primarily effective due to<br/>automatic association with environmentally learned sounds and<br/>associated meanings and concepts (whether that of music,<br/>speech, or environmental noises).  Which overall leads towards<br/>a conclusion that most aspects of music are culturally based not<br/>universal.  I do want to try to avoid trying to find the elusive grand<br/>unification theory of music, but when discussing a particular<br/>phenomenon there is always more or less due to various<br/>factors.  Anyway, another way of looking at this view could be<br/>Pavlovian.  Like if a bell gets a dog to salivate, then I suppose a<br/>circumstance could come about where a violin makes a man fall<br/>in love or a melody brings someone to tears, all by association.<br/>Is this what you&apos;re talking about?  Is this a more powerful force<br/>than any biologically universal aspects of music perception?</p><p>-Aaron</p></div><h3>backfromthesilo &#x3C;backfromthesilo@yahoo.com&#x3E;</h3><span>1/16/2005 10:05:26 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Carl, well put and to the point.  A couple comments:</p><p>&gt; Obviously everything is a byproduct of some underlying reason,<br/>&gt; if you&apos;re a reductionist.<br/>&gt;</p><p>Obviously I am a reductionist.  But I take such a path both<br/>honestly and with purpose.  I am a reductionist both because of<br/>my obsessive thought tendency and for pedegogical reasons.  I<br/>want to be able to explain music in ways that acknowledge the<br/>complexity and huge number of inseperable influences, but I<br/>want to free my teaching from necessarily cultural binds.  In other<br/>words, if I were teaching English I would obviously have to teach<br/>everything particular to English.  However unlike most teachers I<br/>would want to be able to state what aspects were unique to<br/>English and even what aspects may be nearly universal in<br/>language and why.  My feeling as a teacher is that if students<br/>understand this foundation they can much more easily be critical<br/>thinkers in all future related studies.  That&apos;s how I am at least.<br/>So musically, I don&apos;t teach &quot;right&quot; and &quot;wrong&quot; but tell all students<br/>*one* rule: one must strive as much as possible to have the<br/>result be *intentional* when it comes to producing a work of art.<br/>Which is to say that experimentation is fine and fun and<br/>educational, but isn&apos;t artistic.  Anyway, we shouldn&apos;t get into a<br/>philosophy of art discussion on the tuning list.  My main point is<br/>that both for myself and for teaching I&apos;m looking to have a<br/>musical viewpoint that steps outside both cultural boundaries<br/>rather than one that is an amalgum of multiple existing cultures.<br/>Then along with that outside viewpoint, I&apos;ll still go and accept<br/>cultural facts and appreciate them when writing music intended<br/>for actual audiences that necessarily have cultural backgrounds.<br/>So in that sense, I am a reductionist.  And thanks for assisting<br/>me in my reductionism.</p><p>&gt;If I write dissonant music, is there any reason to say I have<br/>used the common perception of beats any less sincerely than<br/>harmonious music?<br/>&gt; -Carl</p><p>Of course not.

And yet &quot;scale&quot;<br/>definitely<br/>&gt; exists outside such intellectual ideas.  I know I personally<br/>&gt; experience &quot;scale&quot; in some fashion beyond intellectual ideas,<br/>&gt; but I do not really experience fifths cycles in such a way.<br/>&gt; Certainly there also exist many scales quite unrelated to fifths.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; -Aaron</p><p>Of course, the &quot;5th&quot; of a diatonic scale is just the 3rd harmonic of<br/>the starting note (put into the correct octave). Or in the<br/>case of meantone temperments, a close approximation to the 3rd<br/>harmonic.  So it is not so much an intellectual idea as an<br/>experimental fact that one would discover playing around with<br/>making tones with a taut string, or some type of a flute, etc...</p><p>This is what I think accounts for the prevalence of the diatonic<br/>major scale in many separate musical cultures. Some people<br/>carried the cycle as far as 12 notes and realized that it almost<br/>closes on itself so that&apos;s a good stopping point. (or they<br/>calculated it would do even better closing at 41 notes, or 53,<br/>or 306...) And it meshes with what I was saying earlier<br/>about harmony because you can have nice blending of 2 voices<br/>a 5th apart.</p><p>Oh, I didn&apos;t mention stopping at 5 notes and getting a pentatonic<br/>scale. So while yes, there certainly are scales that don&apos;t<br/>have anything to do with the cycle of 5ths, I think it is the<br/>most prevalent scale making idea.</p><p>--Jeff</p></div><h3>jjensen142000 &#x3C;jjensen14@hotmail.com&#x3E;</h3><span>1/16/2005 11:18:20 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;backfromthesilo&quot;<br/>&lt;backfromthesilo@y...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; --- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;Mohajeri Shahin&quot;<br/>&gt; &lt;shahinm@k...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt; &gt; For some historical basis of scale , have a look at these 2 links<br/>&gt; :<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; 1- <a href="http://www.webster.sk.ca/GREENWICH/natbasis.htm">http://www.webster.sk.ca/GREENWICH/natbasis.htm</a><br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; 2-<a href="http://www.webster.sk.ca/greenwich/fl-compl.htm">http://www.webster.sk.ca/greenwich/fl-compl.htm</a><br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; shaahin<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Thanks, but scanning these articles they seem to be extremely<br/>&gt; rudimentary and designed for introduction of these ideas to<br/>&gt; non-music theorists.

But I take such a path both<br/>&gt;honestly and with purpose.  I am a reductionist both because of<br/>&gt;my obsessive thought tendency and for pedegogical reasons.  I<br/>&gt;want to be able to explain music in ways that acknowledge the<br/>&gt;complexity and huge number of inseperable influences, but I<br/>&gt;want to free my teaching from necessarily cultural binds.  In other<br/>&gt;words, if I were teaching English I would obviously have to teach<br/>&gt;everything particular to English.  However unlike most teachers I<br/>&gt;would want to be able to state what aspects were unique to<br/>&gt;English and even what aspects may be nearly universal in<br/>&gt;language and why.  My feeling as a teacher is that if students<br/>&gt;understand this foundation they can much more easily be critical<br/>&gt;thinkers in all future related studies.  That&apos;s how I am at least.<br/>&gt;So musically, I don&apos;t teach &quot;right&quot; and &quot;wrong&quot; but tell all students<br/>&gt;*one* rule: one must strive as much as possible to have the<br/>&gt;result be *intentional* when it comes to producing a work of art.<br/>&gt;Which is to say that experimentation is fine and fun and<br/>&gt;educational, but isn&apos;t artistic.  Anyway, we shouldn&apos;t get into a<br/>&gt;philosophy of art discussion on the tuning list.  My main point is<br/>&gt;that both for myself and for teaching I&apos;m looking to have a<br/>&gt;musical viewpoint that steps outside both cultural boundaries<br/>&gt;rather than one that is an amalgum of multiple existing cultures.<br/>&gt;Then along with that outside viewpoint, I&apos;ll still go and accept<br/>&gt;cultural facts and appreciate them when writing music intended<br/>&gt;for actual audiences that necessarily have cultural backgrounds.<br/>&gt;So in that sense, I am a reductionist.

This might help me<br/>understand your<br/>&gt; questions.<br/>&gt;</p><p>Carl, while I teach everything I am confident in to whomever is<br/>interested my main income source is teaching private guitar<br/>lessons.  I have a bachelor&apos;s of music and have always<br/>considered working towards various formal teaching situations<br/>and I have some experience as a student tutor at the university<br/>level but I&apos;m currently only teaching privately now.  I teach all ages<br/>and levels and I try to bring some basic sense of acoustics and<br/>universality to my teaching from the very beginning.</p><p>I don&apos;t see why students should first learn all the mistaken ideas<br/>of traditional theory in order to gain an understanding of<br/>harmonics and other important ideas.  But it is difficult in that<br/>there exists no written elementary theory introduction that is not<br/>full of traditional bias.  Also I recognize that as long as I&apos;m<br/>teaching guitar and not general creative musicianship I am stuck<br/>in that world somewhat.  Still I get all my beginning students<br/>improvising with modes over a drone before they worry too much<br/>about chords and key changes.</p><p>&gt;<br/>&gt; Indeed.  Music theory as it is currently taught in universities is<br/>&gt; fairly ignorant of itself.  And serialism, atonal music, etc, strikes<br/>&gt; me as primarily a deconstructionist movement within<br/>academia, rather<br/>&gt; than a legitimate genre.  Their theories are typically BS in my<br/>&gt; experience.<br/>&gt;</p><p>I actually had professors honest enough to admit that a large<br/>part of the serialist movement was due to internal pressure<br/>within academia.  That in the 20th century emphasis on<br/>&quot;research&quot; at universities over &quot;education&quot; it looked better to<br/>present complex hard to understand very heady music.  Then<br/>those sorts of people got professorships and in a cyclical<br/>fashion the system perpetuated itself at colleges.  It was very<br/>much looked down upon to write any music that didn&apos;t require<br/>complex EXPLANATION.  Nowadays professors are not so<br/>extreme but they were students at those times and were<br/>educated themselves in that stifling, overly analytic situation.</p><p>Harmonic Experience by Mathieu is one of the only attempts I<br/>know of to provide a better theory that is still accessible to<br/>normal musicians and not just theorists.  Unfortunately his<br/>theories are less than perfect and are still grounded in traditional<br/>20th century theory enough that large portions of the book are<br/>inappropriate to many students.  Still, the Section I of Harmonic<br/>Experience is one of the very best introductions to real theory I&apos;ve<br/>seen.</p><p>I guess part of my struggle as a teacher is that I&apos;m forced to<br/>teach traditional concepts of guitar theory like various chords,<br/>major scales, etc.  And yet I&apos;m always kicking myself when I end<br/>up getting a student a book with excellent repertoire but which<br/>explains theories as per the circle of fifths and the worst:<br/>explaining the origin of chords as being every other note in a<br/>scale put together.  Among other things, I&apos;m desperately seeking<br/>a way to teach students about chords without teaching such BS<br/>theory but I still have to get them functional on structuring chords<br/>without going through tons of lessons on harmonic theory and<br/>the differences between temperament and just tuning.  Currently<br/>my only solution is to guage the student and either head down<br/>the long road of actually teaching them to understand and hear<br/>the harmonic series or I teach the &quot;every other note&quot; theory but<br/>tell them that that isn&apos;t really what&apos;s going on but it&apos;s just a<br/>working way to think about it and if they really want to know more<br/>we can go into that if there&apos;s time.</p><p>I want to give students a conceptual approach to theory such that<br/>they can understand critically all the future theory they may come<br/>across.  Personally, I have been able to conceptually deal with<br/>much more music and theory since becoming familiar with<br/>tuning, harmonics, and acoustics.  I can see the confusions in<br/>other theory and make sense of it and actually learn something<br/>useful from an explanation of some style or piece.  I want to<br/>provide that sort of critical thinking ability for my students, so I<br/>want to make clear to them what acoustical and perceptual<br/>forces simply exist and govern everything so they can relate<br/>everything to that and understand that everything else is<br/>contextual to the instruments, language, time period, or culture it<br/>is in.  And I have to provide such an explanation within the<br/>bounds of normal music introduction, not in some special theory<br/>course.

Consider the enormous<br/>role it plays in drones/tonality of any sort, not to mention western chord<br/>progressions.</p><p>One might also wonder about the primacy of the diatonic modes. My theory,<br/>apart from looking at a 7-note diatonic as a MOS, is that when you stack<br/>octave-reduced fifths, 7-notes is a special point of arrival not only for<br/>being a MOS, but for the fact that adding one more pitch (the 8th pitch),<br/>makes you have to do *2* octave reductions. Looking at it another way, going<br/>up a 5th (* 3:2) and down a 4th (* 3:4) allows one to stay in an octave until<br/>we get to the 8th pitch (C# if we start at C: C-D-G-A-E-B-F#-[C#]). Simply<br/>doing it this way gives us Lydian mode, and perhaps this was the first way<br/>the chain of fifths idea of scale building was discovered-simply going up in<br/>one direction.</p><p>The most logical thing to have happened in natural development might have been<br/>the tetrachordal framework &apos;C-F-G-C&apos;, the ear hears the C-F, C-G, and G-C as<br/>stable structures because of their smaller ratios. Then perhaps because of<br/>proximity, the voice prefers smaller steps when choosing pitches to &apos;fill in&apos;<br/>the gaps left by the tetrachordal frame. So we get the arrival of 9/8, 81/64<br/>(or 5/4---the argument is still out about medieval monks singing preferences,<br/>right?), etc.</p><p>So our major scale is a force of nature, so to speak.

I commend you on your goal.<br/>I do think there&apos;s use in explaining chords in *both*<br/>diatonic (scale degrees) and JI (harmonic series) terms<br/>to students.  Guitar is natural for learning elementary<br/>JI stuff because string harmonics provide first-hand<br/>experience of the phenomenon.</p><p>As to scales, there are many possible scales, all of them<br/>worth hearing and playing.  On a 12-tone guitar, most of<br/>them are not playable, but there are still a great many<br/>scales outside of the diatonic scale.  Teaching triads in<br/>both diatonic and octatonic contexts, for example, may be<br/>valuable.</p><p>Another area to explore is bending notes.  Many genres,<br/>especially blues, make excellent use of this microtonal<br/>feature.</p><p>If your students really are interested in non-12, then<br/>19, 22, and 31 are obvious choices.  I would think 19<br/>would be the most natural first non-12 system for guitar<br/>pedagogy, and in fact master guitarist Neil Haverstick<br/>has written a book on it...</p><p><a href="http://www.microstick.net/custom2.html">http://www.microstick.net/custom2.html</a></p><p>...it is called &quot;19 Tones: A New Beginning&quot;.  I haven&apos;t<br/>seen it yet.</p><p>Easley Blackwood has written a beautiful guitar suite<br/>for 15-tET guitar in his own notation, and it was<br/>professionally performed and recorded.  See...</p><p><a href="http://lumma.org/">http://lumma.org/</a></p><p>...for recommended recordings.  You could loan them to<br/>your students.  Just hearing microtonal music changed<br/>my entire outlook on music.</p><p>I wouldn&apos;t worry to much about the effects of traditional<br/>teaching materials.  The diatonic system is still a great<br/>system, and every musician should know about it.

I definitely find the use of<br/>harmonics on guitar to be essentially useful.  Fact is that most of<br/>my students don&apos;t really know what they are &quot;interested&quot; in and a<br/>large part of my job as a teacher is to get them interested.  So I&apos;m<br/>not really in a position to get them into 19-tet or anything like that,<br/>mostly my goal is to help them listen closer to music and then to<br/>go expressively where their ears lead them and of course to<br/>provide feedback encouragement and answer questions along<br/>the way.  Kind of a Montesori approach I guess.  So since they&apos;ve<br/>basically picked guitar and start out with a somewhat traditional<br/>approach, I mostly try to get them to think clearly about what the<br/>guitar is or isn&apos;t good at doing, so they can judge things for<br/>themselves.</p><p>Anyway, thanks again.  I think I&apos;ve got a good sense now of how<br/>to go about this for now.</p><p>-Aaron</p><p>&gt;<br/>&gt; Just some general remarks...  I commend you on your goal.<br/>&gt; I do think there&apos;s use in explaining chords in *both*<br/>&gt; diatonic (scale degrees) and JI (harmonic series) terms<br/>&gt; to students.  Guitar is natural for learning elementary<br/>&gt; JI stuff because string harmonics provide first-hand<br/>&gt; experience of the phenomenon.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; As to scales, there are many possible scales, all of them<br/>&gt; worth hearing and playing.  On a 12-tone guitar, most of<br/>&gt; them are not playable, but there are still a great many<br/>&gt; scales outside of the diatonic scale.  Teaching triads in<br/>&gt; both diatonic and octatonic contexts, for example, may be<br/>&gt; valuable.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Another area to explore is bending notes.  Many genres,<br/>&gt; especially blues, make excellent use of this microtonal<br/>&gt; feature.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; If your students really are interested in non-12, then<br/>&gt; 19, 22, and 31 are obvious choices.  I would think 19<br/>&gt; would be the most natural first non-12 system for guitar<br/>&gt; pedagogy, and in fact master guitarist Neil Haverstick<br/>&gt; has written a book on it...<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; <a href="http://www.microstick.net/custom2.html">http://www.microstick.net/custom2.html</a><br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; ...it is called &quot;19 Tones: A New Beginning&quot;.  I haven&apos;t<br/>&gt; seen it yet.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Easley Blackwood has written a beautiful guitar suite<br/>&gt; for 15-tET guitar in his own notation, and it was<br/>&gt; professionally performed and recorded.  See...<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; <a href="http://lumma.org/">http://lumma.org/</a><br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; ...for recommended recordings.  You could loan them to<br/>&gt; your students.  Just hearing microtonal music changed<br/>&gt; my entire outlook on music.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I wouldn&apos;t worry to much about the effects of traditional<br/>&gt; teaching materials.  The diatonic system is still a great<br/>&gt; system, and every musician should know about it.

The idea that the existence of a piece<br/>of music can prove or disprove anything is not very useful since<br/>musical is art and can be whatever the artist wants.  Does the<br/>existence of abstract painting disprove a psychological basis for<br/>realism or symbolism in art??  The real question is whether<br/>pieces like a noise piece (that cannot possibly be percieved as<br/>related to scale) are a distinctly different experience to a listener<br/>or not.  I think they clearly are.  To put it another way, I could write<br/>a piece in which loud infrasonic pulses are meant to be fealt<br/>more than heard and it could be valid art but would it disprove<br/>the significance of audibility to music?  Obviously there are many<br/>aspects of music and not every piece must include every one but<br/>that doesn&apos;t deny their existence.</p><p>My experience is that there exists something experiential, which I<br/>guess I&apos;ll call the polytonal effect of set scales that is distinctly<br/>absent or harder to percieve in the pieces mentioned.  Although<br/>perhaps it is similar in a noise piece to having consistency in<br/>frequency of repeated or returning noises even though they are<br/>&quot;unpitched.&quot;</p><p>I guess my current thought is really that what I&apos;m describing is<br/>related to both short and long term pitch memory and polytonality<br/>is a useful way to discuss it.  The same reason it feels right to<br/>start each new phrase on the same tonic or end on the original<br/>tonic is why it feels more natural to come back to the same third<br/>scale degree each time.  Alterations are felt as either mutations<br/>of the scale or additional notes making the scale larger and<br/>more complex.  Excessive mutation or many, many note scales<br/>can become overwhelming and cause a loss of sense of scale.<br/>Commatic drift can be slow enough potentially to become<br/>accepted in certain circumstances depending on the listener.<br/>So compositional decisions can influence how strongly felt the<br/>sense of &quot;scale&quot; is, but such a sense certainly exists<br/>independant of being a byproduct of cycles of fifths, harmonics,<br/>or instrument limitations.</p><p>I&apos;d relate the effect of disintigration or confusion of scale to<br/>disintigration of verbal language into nonsensical crazy<br/>gibberish.  The associative meaning is lost and the listener<br/>becomes aware of other aspects of the experience.  Which is a<br/>wonderful effect.  This is however distinct from listening to a<br/>foriegn language or unknown scale.  In that situation,<br/>association is less immediate but a sense of order will be<br/>present and the listener will start to sense the existence of<br/>specific language behaviors (repeated words or phrasing) or<br/>scale notes.</p><p>-Aaron</p></div><h3>Rich Holmes &#x3C;rsholmes@mailbox.syr.edu&#x3E;</h3><span>1/19/2005 8:11:12 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>&quot;Bill Sethares&quot; &lt;<a href="mailto:sethares@ece.wisc.edu">sethares@ece.wisc.edu</a>&gt; writes:</p><p>&gt; I can think of two different kinds of examples of<br/>&gt; music that shuns any use of scales.

I think you&apos;ve hit on a good idea here, to identify<br/>scientifically just when we perceive sounds as different or the same.</p><p>There are two distinct but related aspects - one being in the realm of<br/>speech, and the other in music.  For tho (as I believe) one stems from the<br/>other, they are by no means equivalent.    There is also an area where they<br/>cross over - in song.  Here we have not lost the linguistic meanings of<br/>sounds made by voices, yet the words are constrained (more or less) to<br/>follow musical pitches.  Some smaller domains within the land of song also<br/>vary in characteristic ways with regard to how important exact intonation is<br/>and how important the linguistic meaning of words is; for example - stage<br/>musicals sung in one&apos;s own tongue; opera sung in a foreign tongue; various<br/>kinds of rock music sung, yelled, screeched or growled (as in death metal).</p><p>You would probably have to control for musical experience and knowledge in<br/>your subjects, too, since only dedicated musos and tuning enthusiasts<br/>readily identify, for example, the difference between 12-TET and alternative<br/>tunings, at least in their &quot;best&quot; keys.  Such subjects may have finer pitch<br/>discrimination in spoken language, too, as may poets.</p><p>As to cultural and regional differences, some comments:  In tone languages,<br/>intonation conveys meaning in precise ways.  For example, most Chinese<br/>languages have 4 to six distinct tones, which function as phonemes (abstract<br/>sound classes), not as meaning markers such as question, statement, doubt<br/>and so on.  These tones are believed to have originally started as a<br/>different phoneme, eg a final consonantal /m/, now lost and transmuted to an<br/>emphatic falling (fourth) tone.  A rising tone does not convey a question;<br/>usually a separate word at the end of the sentence does this, eg &quot;ma&quot; - in a<br/>level tone - marks a question in Mandarin.  Properly tho, these &quot;tones&quot; are<br/>tonemes - since it the assimilation of the actual spoken and heard tones to<br/>a wider, abstract class of tones that produces meaning.</p><p>You might reasonably wonder how these tone differences can be combined with<br/>musical notes in a song - I sure did!  It was only after I&apos;d heard a fair<br/>bit of Chinese song that I realised that the tone differences of the spoken<br/>word are preserved, mostly as microtonal changes to the musical pitch, but<br/>sometimes, for dramatic effect, exaggerated to the extent of a pitch change<br/>of up to a major third or even a fourth.  A good singer produces some<br/>wonderful slides and bends!  It can be hard at times to identify the basic<br/>melodic note, as it may be attacked from the high side before being driven<br/>down and up again.  Listen to some Chinese opera to see what I mean.<br/>Interestingly, I can produce bends with a similar range on the p&apos;i p&apos;a,<br/>because of the very high frets, just by pressing vertically.</p><p>By and large, for musical purposes, we can consider the toneme as a<br/>microtonal melody superposed on the current pitch.  The mood of a piece of<br/>Chinese opera still depends largely on the speed and amount of movement<br/>between the scale pitches, as it does in Italian opera.</p><p>Regards,<br/>Yahya<br/>  -----Original Message-----<br/>  From: backfromthesilo [<a href="mailto:backfromthesilo@yahoo.com">mailto:backfromthesilo@yahoo.com</a>]<br/>  Sent: Monday 17 January 2005 17:24 pm<br/>  To: <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a><br/>  Subject: [tuning] Re: What drives &quot;scales&quot;</p><p>  --- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, Patrick Heddles<br/>  &lt;p_heddles@y...&gt; wrote:</p><p>  &gt; I think the key to that is the octave, which is<br/>  &gt; fundamental to every scale I&apos;m familiar with.

First are<br/>  &quot;electronic noise&quot; pieces. For example, the CD Red Velvet<br/>  by Eric Lyons (music that &quot;hypernavigates a compressed informational<br/>  world) has many tracks that make use of no obvious scales or<br/>  discrete pitch sets.</p><p>  The second example is some of the adaptively<br/>  tuned pieces. For example, neither Local Anomaly</p><p>  <a href="http://eceserv0.ece.wisc.edu/~sethares/mp3s/localanomaly.html">http://eceserv0.ece.wisc.edu/~sethares/mp3s/localanomaly.html</a></p><p>  nor the more recent Aerophonious Intent</p><p>  <a href="http://homepages.cae.wisc.edu/~sethares/aerophonious.mp3">http://homepages.cae.wisc.edu/~sethares/aerophonious.mp3</a></p><p>  have any kind of formalized scale -- the pitches continuously<br/>  wander (microtonally) all around.</p><p>  These two kinds of examples argue against the likelihood<br/>  of a firm psychoacoustic basis for scales.</p><p>  --Bill Sethares</p><p>So Bill has shown that not only is it possible to imagine non-scale music,<br/>it is also possible to realise it.</p><p>Another example is Percy Grainger&apos;s experimental music, produced using<br/>machines of his own devising, in which the pitches produced are determined<br/>entirely by the shape of a curve cut out in cardboard, and other<br/>continuously variable means.  These machines have been preserved in the<br/>[Percy] Grainger Museum in Melbourne, Victoria, Australia (where I live).<br/>So have some of his own recordings made on those machines, in which he can<br/>be heard discussing the setup and operation with others who collaborated<br/>with him in performing these pieces; I have a copy on cassette tape of some,<br/>kindly provided by the Museum several years ago when I took my son to visit<br/>it.</p><p>For an even more homely example, have you never banged and tapped on a tin<br/>can to make music?  Most cans are not as amenable to producing different<br/>pitches as they are to producing different &quot;pitchy&quot; noises, and even the<br/>best of them found by chance lack something in relating the tones you can<br/>imagine you hear from them.  In short, few tin cans can produce scales.<br/>(Unless, perhaps, they be cans of imperfectly cleaned fish ...)</p><p>However, surely the existence of such music does not argue against scales<br/>reflecting something fundamental to human psychology?</p><p>For analogy, consider pictorial art.  Much of it is in colour, and uses<br/>pretty much the whole accessible visible spectrum.  Yet a significant<br/>portion of the world&apos;s interesting art is entirely devoid of colour.  It<br/>uses other artistic means - form, line, contrast, chiaroscuro, rhythm,<br/>balance - to achieve perfectly worthwhile artistic aims.  A sculpture such<br/>as Michelangelo&apos;s David does not deny the existence of colour, or its<br/>importance to our psyche; it simply does not rely on it.</p><p>Sure, you can make music without scales, but that doesn&apos;t mean that scales<br/>are not based on human psychology and physiology.</p><p>Them&apos;s my two bits.</p><p>Regards,<br/>Yahya</p><p>--<br/>No virus found in this outgoing message.<br/>Checked by AVG Anti-Virus.<br/>Version: 7.0.300 / Virus Database: 265.7.1 - Release Date: 19/1/05</p></div><h3>Pete McRae &#x3C;ambassadorbob@yahoo.com&#x3E;</h3><span>1/19/2005 9:07:16 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>I think Bill&apos;s onto something, here.

I think you&apos;ve hit on a good idea here, to identify<br/>&gt; scientifically just when we perceive sounds as different or the<br/>same.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; There are two distinct but related aspects - one being in the<br/>realm of<br/>&gt; speech, and the other in music.  For tho (as I believe) one<br/>stems from the<br/>&gt; other, they are by no means equivalent.    There is also an area<br/>where they<br/>&gt; cross over - in song.  Here we have not lost the linguistic<br/>meanings of<br/>&gt; sounds made by voices, yet the words are constrained (more<br/>or less) to<br/>&gt; follow musical pitches.  Some smaller domains within the land<br/>of song also<br/>&gt; vary in characteristic ways with regard to how important exact<br/>intonation is<br/>&gt; and how important the linguistic meaning of words is; for<br/>example - stage<br/>&gt; musicals sung in one&apos;s own tongue; opera sung in a foreign<br/>tongue; various<br/>&gt; kinds of rock music sung, yelled, screeched or growled (as in<br/>death metal).<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; You would probably have to control for musical experience and<br/>knowledge in<br/>&gt; your subjects, too, since only dedicated musos and tuning<br/>enthusiasts<br/>&gt; readily identify, for example, the difference between 12-TET<br/>and alternative<br/>&gt; tunings, at least in their &quot;best&quot; keys.  Such subjects may have<br/>finer pitch<br/>&gt; discrimination in spoken language, too, as may poets.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; As to cultural and regional differences, some comments:  In<br/>tone languages,<br/>&gt; intonation conveys meaning in precise ways.  For example,<br/>most Chinese<br/>&gt; languages have 4 to six distinct tones, which function as<br/>phonemes (abstract<br/>&gt; sound classes), not as meaning markers such as question,<br/>statement, doubt<br/>&gt; and so on.  These tones are believed to have originally started<br/>as a<br/>&gt; different phoneme, eg a final consonantal /m/, now lost and<br/>transmuted to an<br/>&gt; emphatic falling (fourth) tone.  A rising tone does not convey a<br/>question;<br/>&gt; usually a separate word at the end of the sentence does this,<br/>eg &quot;ma&quot; - in a<br/>&gt; level tone - marks a question in Mandarin.  Properly tho, these<br/>&quot;tones&quot; are<br/>&gt; tonemes - since it the assimilation of the actual spoken and<br/>heard tones to<br/>&gt; a wider, abstract class of tones that produces meaning.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; You might reasonably wonder how these tone differences can<br/>be combined with<br/>&gt; musical notes in a song - I sure did!  It was only after I&apos;d heard<br/>a fair<br/>&gt; bit of Chinese song that I realised that the tone differences of<br/>the spoken<br/>&gt; word are preserved, mostly as microtonal changes to the<br/>musical pitch, but<br/>&gt; sometimes, for dramatic effect, exaggerated to the extent of a<br/>pitch change<br/>&gt; of up to a major third or even a fourth.  A good singer produces<br/>some<br/>&gt; wonderful slides and bends!  It can be hard at times to identify<br/>the basic<br/>&gt; melodic note, as it may be attacked from the high side before<br/>being driven<br/>&gt; down and up again.  Listen to some Chinese opera to see<br/>what I mean.<br/>&gt; Interestingly, I can produce bends with a similar range on the<br/>p&apos;i p&apos;a,<br/>&gt; because of the very high frets, just by pressing vertically.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; By and large, for musical purposes, we can consider the<br/>toneme as a<br/>&gt; microtonal melody superposed on the current pitch.  The mood<br/>of a piece of<br/>&gt; Chinese opera still depends largely on the speed and amount<br/>of movement<br/>&gt; between the scale pitches, as it does in Italian opera.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Regards,<br/>&gt; Yahya<br/>&gt;   -----Original Message-----<br/>&gt;   From: backfromthesilo [<a href="mailto:backfromthesilo@y">mailto:backfromthesilo@y</a>...]<br/>&gt;   Sent: Monday 17 January 2005 17:24 pm<br/>&gt;   To: <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a><br/>&gt;   Subject: [tuning] Re: What drives &quot;scales&quot;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;   --- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, Patrick Heddles<br/>&gt;   &lt;p_heddles@y...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;   &gt; I think the key to that is the octave, which is<br/>&gt;   &gt; fundamental to every scale I&apos;m familiar with.

I believe the number<br/>of tones in Indochinese languages and other Chinese languages is similar.</p><p>Each toneme is an abstract class of [allo]tones, just as a phoneme is an<br/>abstract class of [allo]phones.  That is to say, your /t/ and my /t/ may<br/>sound different, in that yours is always aspirated, whereas mine is not<br/>aspirated in word-final positions, but most native speakers of English<br/>understand - and classify - both sounds as a /t/ equally well.</p><p>The degree of variability in use of tonemes is similar to that for<br/>phonemes - these are meaningful units of language, and must be understood!<br/>This is why it&apos;s usually harder for English speakers to learn Chinese than<br/>vice versa - we don&apos;t have any, whereas they do, and simply find it<br/>unnecessary to use them in English.  They do have to master some new<br/>phonemes, such as the two /th/ consonant sounds in &quot;We think with our<br/>brains.&quot;  (Sorry, I don&apos;t have the IPA symbols to hand for these phonemes.)<br/>But we have to add some new consonants and vowels, and simultaneously learn<br/>and apply the &apos;tune&apos; of each new word.</p><p>The toneme is more than a pitch class.  It also includes a particular<br/>stress.</p><p>This is how I hear the tones in Mandarin Chinese - it&apos;s not a scientific<br/>description!:<br/>          |     Initial Pitch    Tune             Stress<br/>Tone 1:   |     Hi Mid           Level            LevelTone 2:   |     Lo<br/>Mid           Falling          Pressed, then fallingTone 3:   |     Low<br/>Rising           FallingTone 4:   |     Hi               Sharply falling<br/>Sharply falling<br/>Pronouncing the tones thus usually gets me understood.  Altho I have heard<br/>native speakers whose second tone consistently has a rising tune, not a<br/>falling one!</p><p>To get a good idea of the acceptable level of variability, you need to hear<br/>a fair bit of the language. A reasonable approach for your purpose might be<br/>to use a language learning CD set that uses several native speakers.  I&apos;ve<br/>recently used such a set for Spanish, and was surprised at the variability<br/>in their /d/ and /j/ phonemes - but it was a good way to learn what works<br/>and increase my comprehension.</p><p>HTH!</p><p>Regards,<br/>Yahya</p><p>--<br/>No virus found in this outgoing message.<br/>Checked by AVG Anti-Virus.<br/>Version: 7.0.300 / Virus Database: 265.7.1 - Release Date: 19/1/05</p></div><h3>Yahya Abdal-Aziz &#x3C;yahya@melbpc.org.au&#x3E;</h3><span>1/20/2005 9:48:21 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Pete,</p><p>And I didn&apos;t mean to sound as rude as my message seemed to me on rereading -<br/>Sorry!</p><p>I understand how you feel, and have little patience with dogma myself - even<br/>less with the dogmatic!
