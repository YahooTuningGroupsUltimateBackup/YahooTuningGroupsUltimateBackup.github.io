That&apos;s<br/>why I asked.  Since the inharmonicity per a single string is in itself not<br/>identical to that of the other strings it is tuned to, although ideally identical,<br/>it provides quite a challenge in itself.  One tries to get a bell-like clarity<br/>when striking the key and I have noted others have found this the greatest<br/>challenge, maybe greater than setting the temperament.</p><p>&gt; &gt;sometimes old and even rusted.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; yes, old and rusted strings will have different inharmonicities and<br/>&gt; even &quot;false beats&quot;. that&apos;s why i said &quot;normally&quot; above --<br/>&gt; by &quot;normally&quot; i meant everything in proper condition.<br/>&gt;</p><p>Then there is no &quot;normal&quot; for each string has its own inharmonic identity and<br/>must be dealt with...and tuned...accordingly.  There is no theoretically<br/>ideal, and therfore &quot;normal,&quot; inharmonic piano string to tune one to another.  One<br/>must expect rust, unusualnesses, etc.</p><p>&gt; &gt;How can you state what difficulties another person<br/>&gt; &gt;has found?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; ?<br/>&gt;</p><p>Maybe I wasn&apos;t clear.
