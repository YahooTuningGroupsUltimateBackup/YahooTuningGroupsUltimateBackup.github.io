But what&apos;s an octony? And in particular what is the 7 limit<br/>octony?</p><p>&gt;It sounds like it should be a Wilson CPS with 8 notes, but the number<br/>&gt;8 doesn&apos;t appear in Pascal&apos;s triangle except as 1 of 8 or 7 of 8 and<br/>&gt;those would be octads, not octanys, as in the difference between a<br/>&gt;hexad and a hexany. And you spell it octony not octany.</p><p>The 7-limit octony consists of all products of any of 1, 3, 5, 7</p><p>As a result, it is complete row of Pascal triangle for 3,5,7 instead of the usual 1,3,5 , as cube.</p><p>(relates to the result that sum of numbers in nth row of tri. is 2^n)</p><p>You can find the two triangles 3, 5, 7 and 3*5, 5*7, 7*3 in it, as well as 1 and 1*3*5*7.</p><p>Similarly you can find the tetrads and hexany in the hypercube.</p><p>Since hexany is combinatin of the two triangles, you can also find the 1,3,5,7 hexany in the<br/>7-limit octony, as 1*3, 1*5, 1*7, 3*5, 5*7, 7*3.</p><p>Since combination of tetrad and hexany is a dekany, you can also find both dekanies in the<br/>_4-dim_ hypercube (they share six vertices in common) as</p><p>1<br/>( one corner of hypercube)</p><p>3 5 7 11<br/>(= tetrahedron - consisting of all vertices one vertex in from corner)</p><p>3*5 3*7 3*11 5*7 5*11 7*11<br/>(= octahedron, 2 vertices in from corner)</p><p>3*5*7 3*7*11 3*5*11 3*7*11<br/>(= tetrahedron - 3 vertices in)</p><p>1*3*5*11<br/>(= opposite corner of hypercube)</p><p>The first tetrahedron + octahedron = 1,3,5,7,11 2)5 Dekany.</p><p>The second tetrahedron + octahedron = 1,3,5,7,11 3)5 Dekany.</p><p>I&apos;d like to do model of this some time, or as much of it as one can do<br/>without being confusing if one can&apos;t do it all.</p><p>I&apos;ve already done a model of Octony as cube, with octahedron inside<br/>- see post day or two ago:</p><p><a href="http://www.egroups.com/message/tuning/15879">http://www.egroups.com/message/tuning/15879</a></p><p>Only realised this connection of the Pascal triangle with the n-dim cube recently,<br/>but Manuel Op de Coul tells me it&apos;s been mentioned before on TL.</p><p>Robert</p></div>
