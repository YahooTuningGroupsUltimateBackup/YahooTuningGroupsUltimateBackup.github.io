I beg his understanding on this matter.</p><p>In anycase, I will try to coalesce my responses in this one message to<br/>both messages of yours that I kept on tab, the latter of which (about<br/>Sazkar) is copy-pasted below.</p><p>================</p><p>Yes, I understand that the Hebrew tradition of Tanakh recital does<br/>involve maqams common to all nations in the Middle East. Naturally so!<br/>But you realize of course that mine was a cynical response to the<br/>latest political crisis in the Levant exacerbated by both the Turkish<br/>and the Israeli sides. I was nevertheless glad that my cynical<br/>reaction found such an informative response in your messsage!</p><p>The Jewish flight throughout history and the musical cultures they<br/>have influenced is noteworthy from a musicological perspective no<br/>doubt! However, my inquiry, however cynical in nature, aimed at<br/>something more historically rooted. To clarify, I meant the music-<br/>making habits in the Old Kingdom of Israel, before the split of Judah,<br/>before even Pythagoras and Aristoxenus were born to the world. What<br/>was the microtonal nature, if any, of the kingdom&apos;s music-making? Did<br/>they have special modes and tunings that they kept records of? Are<br/>there any remaining musical treatises from those periods? What impact<br/>did those have on the music of Ptolemaic, Byzantine and Caliphate<br/>empires? And more importantly, does any of this have any reflections<br/>to the quotidian state of Israel which occupies a place in the Levant<br/>today?</p><p>It is a glad occasion to share in kindred spirit your enthusiasm<br/>toward achieving greater &quot;tarab&quot; or &quot;rapture&quot;, if you will, through<br/>the utilization of maqamat. Amidst all the political turmoils looming<br/>like a dark sceptre over the holy land, one cannot but overstate the<br/>importance of maqam tradition&apos;s unifying role on the whole<br/>geography... IF, that is, the nations stopped their petty bickerings<br/>and grandiose posturings over one another and shared this common<br/>culture and all the spiritual elation it brings in due humility!</p><p>But what we see is a scene of cultural sacking, with &quot;modern&quot; nations<br/>intent on usurping Alpharabius, Avicenna, Safi al-din and the lot into<br/>their own genetic pot! And moreover we witness them shamelessly<br/>ascribing maqams and perdes to their own blood and race!</p><p>It&apos;s all very apparent that nationalism is a late 19th Century<br/>phenomenon imported from the Balkans and the West, a terribly vulgar<br/>and decadent form of society management at that. it bides not in the<br/>least with the nature of maqamat.</p><p>At this point, though I am confident that I made it out very clearly<br/>in the past, I still find the need to emphasize that I do not promote<br/>any kind of racism or ethno-centrism. Especially not in music! To me,<br/>being Turkish, Arabic, Persian, Kurdish, etc... is a matter of culture-<br/>language union. I utterly detest and abhor any attempts to<br/>ideologically draw puritan lineages to whatnot tribe and whatnot<br/>ancestry in order to promote one&apos;s own superiority over others. I<br/>abhor it even more when, say, Arabic music/tuning is pushed forth in<br/>the international arena to the detriment of Turkish music/tuning or<br/>vice versa.</p><p>Shameful is the current state of affairs that reduced Turkness to the<br/>state of ethno-centrism in the bloody conflict with Kurdish<br/>seperatists. Shameful again are the machinations of Islamicist<br/>romantics in the region! Shameful were and are all attempts to<br/>nationalize a broad musical tradition that does not belong to one<br/>nation alone. Shameful are those who distorted traditions to conform<br/>to the ideological doctrines of this or that regime.</p><p>Turkish intonation of maqamat still awaits to free itself from<br/>nationalistic dogmas. Arabs may also be thusly handicapped - being<br/>themselves so intent on &quot;making themselves the other&quot;. So far, the<br/>trend had been the seeking of sellout right-wing political support in<br/>the promotion of an ethno-centric music agenda against Kemalist<br/>leftists, who exploited even worse Ataturk&apos;s name to promote some<br/>ultra-Westernism in music education. Ataturk&apos;s original intent, it<br/>appears, does not support either side. He seems to have wanted the<br/>polyphonization of folk and popular songs of ingenuity, slyvan craft,<br/>and unpretentious straightforwardness as the new national music. If he<br/>was lectured on the microtonality of even those songs, would he still<br/>have insisted on twelve-tone polyphonization and horribly warping of<br/>Huseyni, Huzzam, Saba, Karjighar, Ushshaq, most of which he adored? I<br/>suspect not!</p><p>The overall results are grotesque in the Alla Turca quarter: The<br/>veneration of mediocre and ostentatious performances of a twisted<br/>syncretic nature under the guise of &quot;national music the way Ataturk<br/>wanted&quot;. Choirs in &quot;civilized attire&quot; trying to imitate the Western<br/>manner of singing undecipherable archaic lyrics all in the name of<br/>modernity and patriotic show!</p><p>And the Alla Franca quarter: Trying to promote Mozart, Bach, Beethoven<br/>and the rest - great geniuses for sure! - as &quot;universal&quot;. No sir. The<br/>only thing universal about music is that every race, nation and<br/>society have their own tastes and practices! But will they listen? No,<br/>they are blinded by the &quot;taqlid&quot; of the ways attributed to the man<br/>whom they do not wish to know in truth, but wish to make conform totheir antagonistic whims.</p><p>That is why I find your efforts to understand the perdeha of maqamat<br/>and their inflexions so commdendable. But you do not stop at that. You<br/>go so far as to apply some ingenious Renaissance polyphony to these<br/>microtonal settings and try to discover how, say, Sazkar and Beyati<br/>became two seperate instances to Turks and Arabs, or how Iran and<br/>Turkiye adopted different intonations for maqams sharing the same name!</p><p>You&apos;ll no doubt forgive me if at times I lose track of your messages<br/>filled with such insightful knowledge, for what am I if not a poor<br/>soul trying to grasp the wonders of music through the sensations that<br/>are a gift from the Maker? And yet, I found your explanations as to<br/>the possible evolution of the Arabic Sazkar quite amusing and well-<br/>established!</p><p>By all that is good and holy, let&apos;s carry on these topics at a more<br/>propituous time, possibly after I have managed to produce some pieces<br/>for Jacques and his crew, what say dear Margo?</p><p>With much cordiality,<br/>Dr. Oz.</p><p>&#x2729; &#x2729; &#x2729;<br/><a href="http://www.ozanyarman.com">www.ozanyarman.com</a></p><p>On Jun 1, 2010, at 9:34 AM, Margo Schulter wrote:</p><p>&gt; Dr. Oz (Ozan Yarman) wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt; [...] I never heard any Jewish tunes pertaining to<br/>&gt;&gt; non-twelve settings in this forum.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Dear Ozan,<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Please let me quickly and happily confirm that the<br/>&gt; maqamat, or maqamot in Hebrew, are used among the<br/>&gt; Sephardic Jews for the recitation of Torah, with<br/>&gt; the maqam chosen to fit the character of the text.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; This is not, of course, surprising when we remember<br/>&gt; the hospitality that many Jews received in various<br/>&gt; Islamic countries and regions of the Near East when<br/>&gt; driven from Spain in 1492, along with the Islamic<br/>&gt; people living there (for example in Grenada) who<br/>&gt; wished to maintain their faith.

It is somewhat amusing how the<br/>two of us, in response to the name Sazkar, set out on quite different<br/>understandings of the _seyir_ -- that is, the &quot;path&quot; or procedure --<br/>to be followed in travelling through this maqam.</p><p>However, this confusion has brought forth at least two happy results,<br/>I hope you will agree. First, I now have some understanding of an<br/>Osmanli Sazkar, if that is the right term, along with a possible<br/>hypothesis as to how this classic Ottoman seyir could have led to the<br/>current Arab maqam, thanks to your clear explanation!</p><p>To keep this response at a more reasonable length and to make it<br/>easier to follow, I will here limit myself mainly to these points: the<br/>Ottoman conception of Sazkar and its seyir as you have so lucidly<br/>presented them; whether and how this seyir might be adapted to my<br/>regular temperament with its different intonation of Rast; and how the<br/>quite different Arab conception of Sazkar might have evolved.</p><p>For the benefit of others who may be reading this, I should quickly<br/>explain two units for measuring steps and intervals which we often<br/>use. The Holdrian comma is equal to one step of 53-EDO, about 22.64<br/>cents; while the yarman is a step in your 79MOS-159 generally equal to<br/>almost precisely 2/3 of a Holdrian comma or 2/159 octave, and is<br/>conveniently equal to about 15-1/8 cents. Thus multiplying the number<br/>of yarmans by 15, and adding a cent for each eight yarmans, gives a<br/>close estimate of the size in cents.</p><p>&gt;&gt;                   Sazkar Jadid     tone       Bayyati<br/>&gt;&gt;              |-------------------|......|-----------------|<br/>&gt;&gt;              A      B*    C*     D      E     F*   F#*    A<br/>&gt;&gt;  cents       0     264   341    495    705   837   969   1200<br/>&gt;&gt;  JI approx  1/1    7/6  39/32   4/3    3/2   13/8  7/4   2/1<br/>&gt;&gt;                264    77     154    209   132   132   231<br/>&gt;&gt;                7:6 117:112 128:117  9:8  13:12  14:13 8:7</p><p>&gt;  Sazkar being a Turkish contrivance, the AEU rendition or its 53<br/>&gt;  Holderian commas approximation seems closer to practice with the<br/>&gt;  scale of this maqam:</p><p>Here I will add some sizes in cents which may help readers new to the<br/>comma system.</p><p>&gt;  Degrees:<br/>&gt;  0   9  17  22  31   39   40    48   53   66  70<br/>    0  204 385 498 702  883  906  1087 1200 1494 1585<br/>~  1/1 9/8 5/4 4/3 3/2  5/3 27/16 15/8  2/1 64/27 5/2</p><p>In this interpretation of Rast, there are no neutral intervals, but<br/>rather 5-limit steps of 8 and 5 commas, or around 10:9 and 16:15,<br/>where a different style of interpretation such as mine would have<br/>neutral or Zalzalian seconds of around 7 and 6 commas. Both<br/>interpretations can be found in 10th-13th century Islamic sources.<br/>Also, as will become clear in your presentation of the seyir, the step<br/>at 39 commas or 5/3 is used in the opening portion of the maqam, and<br/>the 27/16 step in the closing portion.</p><p>Before addressing the question you ask below about the Arab<br/>interpretation of Sazkar, I might present another version of your<br/>listing of the steps and interval sizes for Rast using commas, and<br/>also giving the tempered sizes in my 704.607-cent regular tuning:</p><p>    Degrees:<br/>    0    9   16    22   31   38   40    48    53   66    69<br/>    0   204  362  498  702  860   906  1064  1200 1494  1562<br/>   1/1  9/8 21/17 4/3  3/2 23/14 27/16 24/13  2/1 64/27 42/17<br/>    0   209  363  495  705  859   914  1068  1200 1486  1562</p><p>In fact, from this &quot;Zalzalian&quot; interpretation of what in the Ottoman<br/>tradition would typically be more of a 5-limit intonation, I can<br/>deduce a possible hypothesis for how the current Arab understanding of<br/>Sazkar could have developed from the classic Ottoman interpretation,<br/>as mentioned above!</p><p>However, it may first be of interest to see how your explanation of<br/>the classic seyir might translate to a Zalzalian tuning of Rast of a<br/>kind which I understand is sometimes practiced in Turkey also. Here I<br/>take it that the first portion of the seyir begins on perde segah; the<br/>second portion with the so-called Ushshaq tetrachord on perde dugah;<br/>and the final portion in Rast, of course, ending on perde rast. First,<br/>let me quote your seyir and step sizes, adding to your notation of<br/>the steps in commas the sizes of these steps in cents, plus a JI<br/>notation for the degrees above the 1/1 (perde rast) in ratios and<br/>commas:</p><p>&gt; Steps:<br/>&gt;    5    9    8    9   5   13    4<br/>     113  204  181  204 113  294   91<br/>  5/4  4/3  3/2   5/3 15/8 2/1 64/27 5/2<br/>  17   22   31    39   48  53   66   70<br/>  |---------------|    |--------------|<br/>        Segah      tone      Hijaz</p><p>&gt;    8     5    9  (so-called Ushshaq tetrachord)<br/>     181   113  204<br/>&gt; 9/8   5/4  4/3  3/2<br/>   9    17   22   31<br/>   |---------------|<br/>   Huseyni with 10:9</p><p>&gt;    9    8   5    9    9      8     5<br/>     204  181 113  204  204    181   113<br/>  1/1  9/8  5/4 4/3  3/2  27/16  15/8  2/1<br/>   0    9   17  22   31    40     48   53<br/>   |-------------|   |------------------|<br/>       Rast      tone        Rast</p><p>&gt; First the maqam starts off with a Segah openining, proceeds to<br/>&gt; expose it further, then, possibly skipping the Ushshaq tetrachord,<br/>&gt; concludes fully in Rast.</p><p>Indeed the first portion appears to match your explanation of Maqam<br/>Segah in your thesis. The optional second portion with the 8-5-9<br/>tetrachord, the so-called Ushshaq, might better be called a version of<br/>Huseyni, which in the Ottoman tradition might take a lower step either<br/>around 10:9 (as here) or 11:10 (as in the example in your thesis).

A yet more<br/>accurate measure of this 9-7-6 variety of Rast as realized in my<br/>regular temperament would be 14-10-9 yarmans.</p><p>&gt; I don&apos;t know how Arabs use it today. I know their habit of lowering<br/>&gt; perde segah to the point of invalidating the leading tone below it<br/>&gt; and skipping all the way down to perde dugah. But what does this<br/>&gt; matter? The maqam has been developed in the Ottoman court during<br/>&gt; the 19th Century. The authentic intonation is ought to be searched<br/>&gt; in Istanbuline aires.</p><p>These matters regarding Arab intonation might be interesting topic for<br/>another thread, and you have stirred my curiosity! However, what I<br/>would like to address here is the Arab understanding of Maqam Sazkar<br/>and a possible connection to the Ottoman conception as you have<br/>artifully explicated it here.</p><p>&gt; (So much for 24-tET as the ultimate simple-resolution basis for all<br/>&gt; maqamat, eh Carl? You ought to get your hands on some masters of<br/>&gt; Classical Turkish music.)</p><p>In the Arab, Persian, and Kurdish traditions also, for example, the<br/>distinction between larger and smaller neutral seconds is important to<br/>interpreters steeped in classical styles. When a step of 130 cents is<br/>wanted (as in one popular Lebanese interpretation of a maqam I play<br/>with a tetrachord of 132-154-209 cents), or a step of 165 cents (as in<br/>your tuning of Huseyni in the Turkish manner), 24-EDO is hardly an<br/>adequate substitute.</p><p>Now for the current Arab interpretation of Maqam Sazkar, and how it<br/>may have evolved from the classic Ottoman Sazkar! Let us begin with<br/>the usual tuning of Maqam Rast at 9-7-6 commas, here giving the Arabic<br/>forms of the perde names, and then showing the strikingly modified<br/>nature of this tetrachord above the final, perde rast of course, in<br/>what is called Sazkar:</p><p>               Typical 9-7-6 Rast</p><p>           rast   dukah sikah jahargah<br/>            F#     G#    Bb    B<br/>commas      0      9     16   22<br/>yarmans     0     14     24   33<br/>cents       0     209   363  495</p><p>      Arab Sazkar jins: 13-3-6 (or 19-5-9 yarmans)</p><p>           rast    kurdi sikah jahargah<br/>            F#      A     Bb       B<br/>commas      0      13     16      22<br/>yarmans     0      19     24      33<br/>cents       0      286   363     495</p><p>Apart from the substitution of perde kurdi for dukah in this<br/>tetrachord, the rest of the seyir is pretty much like a usual Maqam<br/>Rast, with the same options for inflections, like evdj/acem and<br/>huseyni/hisar. After the initial ascent, one possible development is<br/>to use the usual perde dukah rather than kurdi, thus returning to a<br/>usual Maqam Rast of the 9-7-6 type.</p><p>In fact, the hypothesis that occurs to me after reading your<br/>explanation of Ottoman Sazkar as still understood in Turkey is that,<br/>performing the upper Hijaz tetrachord of the seyir in a Zalzalian<br/>style of intonation, Arab interpreters may have transposed the notes<br/>kirdan-sinbulah-buzruk down an octave to rast-kurdi-sikah, thus<br/>arriving at the striking trichord above the final of Arab Sazkar,<br/>which with the usual jaharkah added forms the first tetrachord!</p><p>     Opening of seyir, Ottoman Sazkar based on 9-7-6 Rast</p><p>                  Segah          tone           Hijaz<br/>         |---------------------|      |----------------------|<br/>commas       6       9     7      9     6      13        3<br/>yarmans      9      14     10    14     9      19        5<br/>cents       132     209   154    209    132    286      77<br/>         Bb      B      C#     Eb     F    F#         A     Bb<br/>        sikah jahargah nawa  hisar   awj  kirdan  sunbulah buzruk<br/>                                           |------------------|<br/>                                                    |<br/>                                                    |<br/>                    v----------------- (transpose down an octave)<br/>                    |<br/>                    |<br/>                    |<br/>                Arab Sazkar      tone          Rast<br/>         |---------------------|      |----------------------|<br/>commas       13     3      6       9      9         7     6<br/>yarmans      19     5      9      14      14        10    9<br/>cents        286    77    154    209     209        154  132<br/>         F#       A    Bb      B      C#     Eb*/D#     F    F#<br/>        rast    kurdi sikah jahargah nava    huseyni   awj  kirdan</p><p>This seems to me a not-too-unlikely hypothesis for the present form of<br/>Arab Sazkar, one starting point for my Sazkar Jadid, which differs in<br/>part by being based on a tetrachord of 9-6-7 commas, which the<br/>20th-century Arab theorist Salah al-Din calls Rast Jadid by contrast<br/>with the usual 9-7-6 commas, but which might well take Ibn Sina&apos;s name<br/>of Mustaqim for a maqam with conjunct tetrachords of 1/1-9/8-39/32-4/3<br/>or 204-139-155 cents, not too far from 14-9-10 yarmans or 209-132-154<br/>cents in my regular temperament. This I explain not to delve here into<br/>some of your following comments which we should explore further when<br/>you have had a chance to reply to this message, Inshallah, but to shed<br/>some perspective on your concluding remark.</p><p>&gt; That is the necessary cadence for Sazkar or Sazkar-i Jedid.  But<br/>&gt; what is that? At this very moment, a wily efreet knocked off the<br/>&gt; lid of my metronome in the other room where it started to tick-tock<br/>&gt; loudly. Maybe he is vexed about this New Sazkar? :)</p><p>Since I have now inquired and learned the wise teaching that an efreet<br/>is also a creature capable of choosing good or evil, let me offer what<br/>I hope will be a due measure of propitiation, out of simple justice as<br/>well as possibly in the interest of your peaceful music making.</p><p>And so I would beg the pardon of your visiting efreet for uttering the<br/>auspicious Ottoman name of Sazkar and then setting out to present a<br/>variation upon the curious Sazkar I knew in what might be to classical<br/>ears a provincial version, as understood and further taken in strange<br/>directions by an alien to the region attempting, among other things,<br/>to find a seyir for the Maqam Mustaqim described by Ibn Sina about a<br/>millennium ago.</p><p>Yet in this very strangeness there may be a certain virtue: for any<br/>knowledgeable person would quickly realize what I gladly acknowledge,<br/>that such a curious style is neither a standard nor a substitute for<br/>the classic Ottoman tradition that has done so much to enrich the Near<br/>East and the world. Rather I would entreat that it be taken as a<br/>pleasant diversion of the reason and senses, one sign of the<br/>exuberance of a Renaissance, and here a Zalzalian Renaissance seeking<br/>to honor the Mutazilah way of logic and art.</p><p>And to your guest, I would make a humble offering of my music and<br/>theory, however uninformed or inept, as a gift meant to impart some<br/>small measure of _tarab_ or enchantment which the infinite variety of<br/>neutral or Zalzalian steps can bring; and as a gentle signpost,<br/>however wayward my seyir, toward the best seyir, which is toward<br/>Allah, or ha-Shem as we often also say in the Jewish tradition, the<br/>compassionate giver of all good things including the wonders of music.</p><p>With many thanks,</p><p>Margo Schulter<br/>mschulter@...</p></div>
