After a night of resting on<br/>this...  (the &quot;tooth fairy&quot; said to pull out the &quot;fangs...&quot;) I<br/>decided communication is best, as it always is...</p><p>I would be happy to join the new &quot;practical&quot; group again but,<br/>seriously, only on the condition that NO people are &quot;banned&quot; in an<br/>undemocratic way....</p><p>Furthermore, Paul Erlich had ALL the e-mail addresses of everybody on<br/>that list ALREADY, since they are mostly all the same people who post<br/>on THIS list!</p><p>ALSO, it is his inalienable right as an American to HATE the new<br/>practical list.  He can even talk about that to other people on it.</p><p>What of that?</p><p>He STILL has a right to READ it!</p><p>There were 35 people on the &quot;practical&quot; list... NOW there are only 18.</p><p>Do you realize that 17 people &quot;unsubscribed&quot; because of this incident!</p><p>This is no way for Jacky to start up a new list!</p><p>Paul has a right to read the list, think what he wants and even POST<br/>what he wants.</p><p>HOWEVER, there would be a caveat THERE.</p><p>If he were to post &quot;obnoxious&quot; things or if his views were so &quot;out of<br/>kilter&quot; with the other participants that he was disturbing them THEN<br/>the list owner should write a private e-mail to him urging him to no<br/>longer post, or consider leaving the list.</p><p>That would be the &quot;correct&quot; way of handling the situation.</p><p>However, that NEVER happened.  Paul never even posted ONCE.  He<br/>wasn&apos;t ALLOWED to!</p><p>I mentioned to Jacky that I would be happy to &quot;resubscribe&quot; but only<br/>under the conditions that no members are &quot;banned&quot; for arbitrary<br/>reasons.</p><p>And we haven&apos;t heard ANYTHING from Paul.  Paul hates words, anyway...<br/>(unlike myself... I&apos;m a GREAT lover of words and communication.<br/>Maybe words are really not as profound as higher mathematics, but<br/>it&apos;s a milieu I enjoy)</p><p>I wish Paul would speak up with his viewpoints, either publicly on<br/>the list or in private... or at least resume his &quot;normal&quot; tuning<br/>posts...</p><p>In this case &quot;silence is&quot; NOT &quot;golden...&quot;</p><p>It&apos;s not even &quot;Tin Pan Alley....&quot;</p><p>_______ _____ _____<br/>Joseph Pehrson</p></div><h3>David Beardsley &#x3C;xouoxno@virtulink.com&#x3E;</h3><span>5/20/2001 6:58:37 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p><a href="mailto:jpehrson@rcn.com">jpehrson@rcn.com</a> wrote:</p><p>&gt; There were 35 people on the &quot;practical&quot; list...

One short post explaining his thoughts,<br/>actions, and possible future plans. Then you can stop posting<br/>constantly on this issue, especially all the mis-information, and<br/>everyone can get back to actually communication instead of innuendo,<br/>hyperbole, and pyrotechnics.</p><p>&gt; In this case &quot;silence is&quot; NOT &quot;golden...&quot;</p><p>No, but seeing as it&apos;s all been said three-times-over, silence would<br/>sure be a relief.</p><p>Regards,<br/>Jon</p></div>
