This is consistent with the A48 notation system in Scala.<br/>The curly braces { and } are a natural representation for -/+ 33.3<br/>cents, because of the similarity of } with 3. (What you prefer: 33.3<br/>cents or 1/3 semitone).<br/>Still needing symbols for +/- 16.7 cents, there are the natural<br/>candidates of the comma up and down, / and \. Their usage is old and<br/>no reason to change it. The syntonic comma is exactly this size in<br/>72-tET (and 144-tET).<br/>Using &gt; for something bigger than ^ has always seemed counterintuitive<br/>to me. The ^ is actually pointing upwards, indicating something<br/>higher, while &gt; is merely pointing to the right. So one could consider<br/>&quot;going right&quot; to be a weak form of &quot;going up&quot;.<br/>These smaller-than and greater-than signs will be used for the<br/>smallest step, 8.3 cents, one step in 144-tET. Closed black left- and<br/>rightward pointing triangles have been suggested by Rapoport for<br/>representing fractions of the syntonic comma. The &lt; and &gt; are the best<br/>ASCII representations for them. In 144-tET they represent half a<br/>syntonic comma.</p><p>In the next version of Scala, this system&apos;s name is A144 and can be<br/>used for 144, 72 and 48-tET. And 36, 24, etc. too of course, if you<br/>should want.</p><p>Here&apos;s how it looks in 72:<br/>  0:          1/1           C<br/>  1:         16.667 cents   C/<br/>  2:         33.333 cents   C}<br/>  3:         50.000 cents   C|   Dbd<br/>  4:         66.667 cents   C}}  Db{<br/>  5:         83.333 cents   C#\  Db\<br/>  6:        100.000 cents   C#   Db<br/>  7:        116.667 cents   C#/  Db/<br/>  8:        133.333 cents   C#}  D{{<br/>  9:        150.000 cents   C#|  Dd<br/> 10:        166.667 cents   D{<br/> 11:        183.333 cents   D\<br/> 12:        200.000 cents   D<br/> 13:        216.667 cents   D/<br/> 14:        233.333 cents   D}<br/> 15:        250.000 cents   D|   Ebd<br/> 16:        266.667 cents   D}}  Eb{<br/>etc.</p><p>And in 144:<br/>  0:          1/1           C<br/>  1:          8.333 cents   C&gt;<br/>  2:         16.667 cents   C/<br/>  3:         25.000 cents   C^<br/>  4:         33.333 cents   C}<br/>  5:         41.667 cents   C}&gt;<br/>  6:         50.000 cents   C|   Dbd<br/>  7:         58.333 cents   C|&gt;  Db{&lt;<br/>  8:         66.667 cents   C}}  Db{<br/>  9:         75.000 cents   C#v  Dbv<br/> 10:         83.333 cents   C#\  Db\<br/> 11:         91.667 cents   C#&lt;  Db&lt;<br/> 12:        100.000 cents   C#   Db<br/> 13:        108.333 cents   C#&gt;  Db&gt;<br/> 14:        116.667 cents   C#/  Db/<br/> 15:        125.000 cents   C#^  Db^<br/> 16:        133.333 cents   C#}  D{{<br/> 17:        141.667 cents   C#}&gt; Dd&lt;<br/> 18:        150.000 cents   C#|  Dd<br/> 19:        158.333 cents   D{&lt;<br/> 20:        166.667 cents   D{<br/> 21:        175.000 cents   Dv<br/> 22:        183.333 cents   D\<br/> 23:        191.667 cents   D&lt;<br/> 24:        200.000 cents   D<br/> 25:        208.333 cents   D&gt;<br/> 26:        216.667 cents   D/<br/>etc.</p><p>Blackjack:<br/>  0: C<br/>  1: C}<br/>  2: C#/  Db/<br/>  3: C#|  Dd<br/>  4: D}<br/>  5: D}}  Eb{<br/>  6: D#|  Ed<br/>  7: E\<br/>  8: E}}  F{<br/>  9: F<br/> 10: F#\  Gb\<br/> 11: F#/  Gb/<br/> 12: G<br/> 13: G}<br/> 14: G#/  Ab/<br/> 15: G#|  Ad<br/> 16: A}<br/> 17: A}}  Bb{<br/> 18: A#|  Bd<br/> 19: B\<br/> 20: B}}  C{<br/> 21: C</p><p>Joseph wrote:<br/>&gt; is the 1/12 tone actually a comma in 72-tET?</p><p>Yes, the syntonic comma.
