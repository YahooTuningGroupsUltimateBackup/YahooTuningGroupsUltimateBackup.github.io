Ives wanted sharps higher than flats.<br/>&gt; He states in his Memos on the Concord Sonata that B# is an<br/>&gt; 1/8th tone higher than C.  That smells like Pythagorean to me.</p><p>I got a whiff of that.  Just thought I&apos;d flesh out Johnny&apos;s<br/>comment with some numbers:</p><p>If &apos;C&apos; is our reference tone at 0 cents, then the Pythagorean<br/>&apos;B#&apos; which is 12 &apos;perfect 5ths&apos; (3:2 ratio) above it, when<br/>&apos;octave&apos;-reduced, measures ~23.46 cents.</p><p>If &apos;tone&apos; was defined by Ives as the 9:8 ratio, then a logarithmic<br/>1/8 of that is ~25.49 cents.</p><p>If Ives&apos;s &apos;tone&apos; was defined as the regular 12-tET ratio of<br/>2^(2/12):1, a logarithmic 1/8-tone is exactly 25 cents.</p><p>To me, those odors are similar enough to buy your proposition.</p><p>However...</p><p>I&apos;ve scanned thru my entire copy of Ives&apos;s _Essays Before A<br/>Sonata, The Majority, and Other Writings_ (W. W. Norton, 1970)<br/>and don&apos;t see the statement to which you refer.</p><p>In fact, only some statements in the &apos;Epilog&apos; of _Essays Before<br/>A Sonata_ and Ives&apos;s essay _Some &apos;Quarter-tone Impressions_<br/>are specifically musical; the rest of the book is basically<br/>philosophical.</p><p>Where is the reference to the B# 1/8-tone higher than C?<br/>(can Dan Stearns help out here?)</p><p>-monz</p><p>Joseph L.
