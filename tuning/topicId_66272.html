I recently got Max Magic Microtuner and I&apos;m<br/>trying to find a balanced, compromised tuning that will be a useful<br/>compositional field to explore and reach the goals I have.</p><p>Here&apos;s where I&apos;m at:</p><p>I want to generally be near-just, and I also want a scale that is<br/>even *enough* to play chromatically in a way that sounds relatively<br/>smooth in direct ascent or descent.  In order to be manageable and<br/>have a decent range, I want to limit myself to a smaller number of<br/>notes.</p><p>I figured that a good balance would be to have a modally focused,<br/>very closely related set of notes, and then use pitch bend to shift<br/>the whole series for major harmonic changes.  I don&apos;t want to use<br/>pitch bend for acheiving a harmonic relation, but using it to change<br/>the overall key seems reasonable.  So I figured that, for example, if<br/>I were using strict JI, I&apos;d use 7/5 instead of 45/32, because that&apos;d<br/>blend better with the tonic 1/1 and then I&apos;d pitch bend 1/1 up to<br/>9/8 and 5/4 would become 45/32.  This made sense because it<br/>would be in context of 9/8 that I would use 45/32.  I&apos;m a little<br/>worried about this approach using a lot of pitch bending and being<br/>confusing, but I&apos;m thinking I could get used to it.</p><p>Additionally, simply to keep everything straight and work with<br/>standard sequencers layouts, I figured that using exactly 24 notes<br/>would be a good balance because I&apos;d have much more to work with<br/>than using only 12, but I can still easily realte things in terms of the<br/>names and positions they will be in a standard sequencer piano roll.</p><p>I&apos;m looking for constructive criticism.  I want to end up with a balance<br/>where I know what I&apos;ve compromised, but I have a decent little universe<br/> of music to explore, especially using the idea of pitch bending to<br/>any new key.</p><p>If I were to temper, I really don&apos;t want it to be too dramatic.  About<br/>the only thing I&apos;d like to temper out is the 14/9 - 25/16 kleisma.<br/>And I&apos;m leaning toward using simple fixed JI.</p><p>I&apos;d absolutely minimally have 7-prime-limit and have decent focus on<br/>9 and 15.  Overall, I&apos;m wanting to go essentially otonal.  I&apos;d like to<br/>explore 11 and 13, though I&apos;m less confident with them.  I&apos;d even like<br/>to have 17 or 19, but I&apos;m leaning towards making those the exception<br/>that I&apos;d have to do extra junk to get to, and not have them in my<br/>normal system.  But I&apos;m not sure.</p><p>What I want ideally is not practical.  And as far as tempering, I&apos;d have<br/>to try things to see how acceptible tempering could be to me.  I really<br/>would like to be able to have about 60+ JI notes per octave available<br/>and be able to easily call forth the exact ones I want at any instant, and<br/>also have 6 or 7 octaves to play with.  What I&apos;m trying to do here is to<br/>accept the reality of the tools and possibilities I really have and make<br/>myself a dynamic little box that I can explore and enjoy and accept that<br/>it just doesn&apos;t have everything, but I&apos;ll figure out how to make good<br/>music with what is there in the box.</p><p>While I&apos;d like to have 7/4, 16/9, and 9/5, they are too close together to<br/>sound evenly sequential without filling in 50+ total notes per octave.<br/>I&apos;d like to see every step in the scale be around 30-75 cents, ideally closer<br/>to 50 to make the scale even.  My thinking was to use 7/4 and 9/5, and<br/>leave 16/9 as a note I would get to by pitch bending the whole system to<br/>4/3 or 16/9 or something else where 16/9 would then exist relative to<br/>the original 1/1.  I have a real hard time making these tough decisions<br/>though.  But the overall point is: I can get anything when I really need it,<br/>I&apos;m trying to have something worth exploring that will lead me in ways I<br/>like to new music.</p><p>So in addition to help on the specifics, I&apos;m hoping to get feedback on<br/>whether people think my approach and attitude is reasonable.<br/>Thanks so much!</p><p>In Harmony,<br/>Aaron</p></div><h3><a id=66276 href="#66276">ðŸ”—</a>Carl Lumma &#x3C;clumma@yahoo.com&#x3E;</h3><span>5/5/2006 6:54:22 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Hi Aaron,</p><p>If Gene can get his e-mail trouble sorted out, I&apos;m sure he&apos;ll<br/>give you some great solutions.

I used to use it so that the keyboard fingerings would be consistent.  Eventually I moved on to a Ztar to get more notes, but I was still doing fine with 24.  I didn&apos;t bother about the sequencer labels because I ignored them.  To find where a particular note was, I pressed the key and the power of MIDI made that note light up on the piano roll.  Spanning multiple channels to get more notes is that bit less practical.</p><p>A blackjack+3 mapping would almost fulfil your criteria.  It&apos;s within 10% of the accuracy you&apos;d have by only tempering out 225:224 (your 14/9 - 25/16 kleisma) and the smallest scale step is around 33 cents.  It works well in the 7-prime limit and has some 11-limit approximations as well.  It doesn&apos;t have any innate 24-ness.  Perhaps it would do as a stop-gap while you find out what harmonies you end up using and how you want to use the pitch bending.  Then you can find a just scale that works with the music you&apos;ve actually written, which I expect would be more to your liking than an abstractly derived one.</p><p>Here&apos;s a description:</p><p><a href="http://www.microtonal.co.uk/miracle/keyboard.html">http://www.microtonal.co.uk/miracle/keyboard.html</a></p><p>                 Graham</p></div><h3><a id=66284 href="#66284">ðŸ”—</a>Carl Lumma &#x3C;clumma@yahoo.com&#x3E;</h3><span>5/5/2006 11:14:16 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>&gt; Again, don&apos;t go with &quot;Aaron requires a 24-note scale&quot; or<br/>&gt; anything else like that.</p><p>Well then, the gloves are off.

But I really don&apos;t see why, today, we<br/>&gt; can&apos;t have the exact tuning we want for each<br/>&gt; and every piece.  (Setting aside, of course, trivial<br/>&gt; questions like *paying* for the instruments that<br/>&gt; can implement them.)<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Regards,<br/>&gt; Yahya<br/>&gt;</p><p>I realize that having &quot;a&quot; tuning isn&apos;t really a very reasonable idea in<br/>some respects.  However, I&apos;m concerned about two factors:</p><p>1. Being able to improvise and play around in order to determine<br/>where I want a piece to go, and what notes I want to focus on for<br/>that piece.  So I want a big enough range to allow for some exploration.</p><p>2. I want to get comfortable with a system so that I don&apos;t confuse which<br/>notes are which from piece to piece.  If I really KNOW that I want a certain<br/>set of notes for a piece, of course I&apos;ll just do that, and there&apos;s no question.<br/>I&apos;m looking for something where I&apos;ll create the system, play around, write<br/>some piece and feel that even if I could imagine something else in the<br/>piece that my system doesn&apos;t allow, I instead focus on what is possible<br/>within my system, so I learn and get comfortable with the placement of<br/>notes overall.  Hence, I want the system to be broad enough to be<br/>satisfactory for lots of different modes, even if it doesn&apos;t cover everything.</p><p>It&apos;s similar to getting a custom-fretted instrument.  You get the setup<br/>figured out, and then try to make as much music as you can on it.</p><p>I know I may change to something else later, but I&apos;m looking for something<br/>I can play with and get comfortable with for a long time.</p><p>-Aaron</p></div><h3><a id=66305 href="#66305">ðŸ”—</a>Aaron Wolf &#x3C;backfromthesilo@yahoo.com&#x3E;</h3><span>5/7/2006 10:24:06 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>&gt; Offhand, I&apos;d say that exposing 22 srutis,<br/>&gt; all just ratios, should about do it.  Unless,<br/>&gt; of course, you intend to use many more<br/>&gt; than seven essential notes per octave in<br/>&gt; your scales.<br/>&gt;</p><p>That&apos;s a good thought...</p><p>&gt; To me, that means using notes that *are<br/>&gt; closely related* to the tonic.  F&apos;rinstance,<br/>&gt; I can just about hack an F# in C, considered<br/>&gt; as the major third above a fourth below a<br/>&gt; fifth above the tonic.  But a C#, being the<br/>&gt; major third above a fourth below a fourth<br/>&gt; below a fifth above the tonic, is getting<br/>&gt; remote.  When I&apos;m playing a against a drone<br/>&gt; on C, that is.  However, if the F# and C# are<br/>&gt; chord notes that coincide with harmonics of<br/>&gt; the more closely related D and A, they&apos;re<br/>&gt; cool.<br/>&gt;</p><p>I think whereas MOST of my notes are to be harmonically related,<br/>stuff like 33/32 and any not in between 7/5 and 3/2 are really<br/>more of melodic function.  I like the idea of having some melodic<br/>passing/leading tones that are dissonant on the way to the harmony.<br/>This is really just to substitute for sliding a la what pitch bend is<br/>normally used for.  I&apos;m not as sure about this part, which is a lot of<br/>the reason for the somewhat equal steps.  This is my least certain<br/>aspect.</p><p>&gt; Define closely related?  Eg, which is closer to C:<br/>&gt;  - B considered as the major third on the fifth, or<br/>&gt;  - B considered as five fifths?<br/>&gt;</p><p>Definitely 15/8 not the bunch of fifths pythagorean one.</p><p>&gt; Again, which is closer to C:<br/>&gt;  - Bb considered as the reduced seventh harmonic, or<br/>&gt;  - Bb considered as the minor third above the fifth?<br/>&gt;</p><p>In most cases the harmonic seventh.</p><p>&gt; I think a lot depends on your feeling for what<br/>&gt; is harmonically close.  Given that you enjoy using<br/>&gt; V - bVI - bVII - I, I&apos;d say you have a reasonable<br/>&gt; tolerance for utonalities.  Perhaps you&apos;d have half<br/>&gt; as much utonality as otonality, as many people do;<br/>&gt; in that case, one would extend one&apos;s interval chains<br/>&gt; further upwards than downwards.<br/>&gt;</p><p>Oh, I love utonal PROGRESSIONS.  Meaning I like the idea of having<br/>a high 1/1 and moving the bass to redefine the 1/1 as a different part<br/>of the harmony, such as in the progression above.  But I don&apos;t like<br/>utonal chords, like 8/7-4/3-8/5-1/1.  My thinking was to use pitch<br/>bend on the whole system to create these utonally based PROGRESSIONS<br/>and keep the note system that otherwise exists primarily otonal.<br/>That make sense?</p><p>&gt;<br/>&gt; The more I read of your requirements, the<br/>&gt; more I&apos;m convinced that only you have the<br/>&gt; actual answers you need.

I would say my goal in discussion is<br/>to get criticism for my whole attitude and ideas so I question them, and<br/>to be exposed to possibilities I hadn&apos;t known about or thought of.  In the<br/>end, I think I do know what I want.  I just want to make sure my ideas<br/>stand up to criticism and questioning, so I can solidify them and really<br/>make some of these tough decisions.

I recently got Max Magic Microtuner and I&apos;m<br/>&gt; trying to find a balanced, compromised tuning that will be a useful<br/>&gt; compositional field to explore and reach the goals I have.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Here&apos;s where I&apos;m at:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I want to generally be near-just, and I also want a scale that is<br/>&gt; even *enough* to play chromatically in a way that sounds relatively<br/>&gt; smooth in direct ascent or descent.  In order to be manageable and<br/>&gt; have a decent range, I want to limit myself to a smaller number of<br/>&gt; notes.</p><p>Hi Aaron,</p><p>I&apos;ve been away from the lists for a few days, so I didn&apos;t see this<br/>until today.  What you&apos;re seeking sounds quite similar to something I<br/>was trying to achieve in 1975.  My 13-limit high-tolerance<br/>temperament (HTT) supplies multiple otonal ogdoads, i.e., very close<br/>approximations of 8:9:10:11:12:13:14:15, on various starting tones.<br/>For details see:</p><p><a href="http://groups.yahoo.com/group/MakeMicroMusic/messages/6847">http://groups.yahoo.com/group/MakeMicroMusic/messages/6847</a><br/>which references another message with .scl data:<br/><a href="http://groups.yahoo.com/group/tuning-math/message/7574">http://groups.yahoo.com/group/tuning-math/message/7574</a><br/>A later message gives some information about the tempering:<br/><a href="http://groups.yahoo.com/group/tuning-math/message/10586">http://groups.yahoo.com/group/tuning-math/message/10586</a></p><p>&gt; ...<br/>&gt; Additionally, simply to keep everything straight and work with<br/>&gt; standard sequencers layouts, I figured that using exactly 24 notes<br/>&gt; would be a good balance because I&apos;d have much more to work with<br/>&gt; than using only 12, but I can still easily realte things in terms<br/>of the<br/>&gt; names and positions they will be in a standard sequencer piano roll.</p><p>As it turned out I didn&apos;t end up with 24 tones/octave, but how about<br/>17 and 29-tone subsets of a 41-tone superset (all of which are<br/>constant structures)?</p><p>In the 29-tone HTT subset, the starting tones on which the ogdoads<br/>occur are Bb, F, C, G, D, and A, so you can modulate quite a bit<br/>without having to resort to pitch-changing on the fly (which leaves<br/>the door open for acoustic instruments).  The tones are reasonably<br/>spaced for melodic purposes, and there are multiple pairs of tones<br/>separated by the 80:81 comma.</p><p>I have the 29-HTT subset as one of the six hard-wired tunings in my<br/>generalized-keyboard Scalatron.  In the fall of 1975 I performed an<br/>improvisation on that instrument in this tuning, which I shared on<br/>MMM:<br/><a href="/makemicromusic/topicId_6820.html#6889">/makemicromusic/topicId_6820.html#6889</a><br/>The .mp3 file is no longer at the link indicated, but if you&apos;re<br/>interested in hearing it, I could put it back for a few days.</p><p>&gt; I&apos;m looking for constructive criticism.  I want to end up with a<br/>balance<br/>&gt; where I know what I&apos;ve compromised, but I have a decent little<br/>universe<br/>&gt;  of music to explore, especially using the idea of pitch bending to<br/>&gt; any new key.</p><p>In a 17-tone subset (which I also call the &quot;triple delight&quot;) the<br/>starting tones for ogdoads are in a chain of neutral 3rds (F, A-<br/>semiflat, and C) -- yes, that&apos;s 3 otonal ogdoads in 17-tones/octave!<br/>This subset can be transposed in a manner similar to your idea of<br/>pitch-bending:  Changing only 3 of the 17 pitches will transpose the<br/>tuning up a neutral 3rd (new starting tones A-semiflat, C, and E-<br/>semiflat).  Change 3 more pitches to transpose up a fifth above the<br/>starting set (C, E-semiflat, and G), or 3 more pitches to transpose a<br/>neutral 6th above the starting set (E-semiflat, G, and B-semiflat),<br/>etc., etc.  Although there are no two pitches differing by ~80:81<br/>within a 17-tone subset, changing the pitches by threes will result<br/>in comma-shifts.  In addition, since there are a lot of neutral 3rds<br/>in a 17-tone subset, it&apos;s possible to come up with some very<br/>unconventional chord progressions.</p><p>I have a 2-2/3-octave set of aluminum tubulongs (tubular bells) in<br/>the 17-tone triple delight that I made in 1979 (not permanently<br/>mounted, however), which will make the point that HTT doesn&apos;t limit<br/>me to electronics.</p><p>One drawback I have found with the 17-tone subsets is that the<br/>melodic spacing of the tones is not as uniform as I would like.</p><p>&gt; If I were to temper, I really don&apos;t want it to be too dramatic.<br/>About<br/>&gt; the only thing I&apos;d like to temper out is the 14/9 - 25/16 kleisma.<br/>&gt; And I&apos;m leaning toward using simple fixed JI.</p><p>The tempering in HTT is so slight that you would be hard pressed to<br/>tell that it&apos;s not JI!</p><p>&gt; I&apos;d absolutely minimally have 7-prime-limit and have decent focus<br/>on<br/>&gt; 9 and 15.  Overall, I&apos;m wanting to go essentially otonal.  I&apos;d like<br/>to<br/>&gt; explore 11 and 13, though I&apos;m less confident with them.</p><p>HTT treats 11&apos;s and 13&apos;s as being in a single sequence of fifths,<br/>e.g., 11/8 of F is the same pitch as 13/8 of D, where the F and D are<br/>in the same sequence of fifths.  Likewise, 7&apos;s are also in the same<br/>sequence of fifths as the 11&apos;s and 13&apos;s, so that 7/4 of Bb is the<br/>same pitch as 11/8 of D.  Thus, there are quite a few possibilities<br/>for common-tone modulations.</p><p>&gt; I&apos;d even like<br/>&gt; to have 17 or 19, but I&apos;m leaning towards making those the<br/>exception<br/>&gt; that I&apos;d have to do extra junk to get to, and not have them in my<br/>&gt; normal system.</p><p>The 29-HTT has an Eb that&apos;s almost exactly 19/16 of C (purely by<br/>accident).  Anything else above the 13 limit would have to be<br/>approximated.</p><p>&gt; ...<br/>&gt; While I&apos;d like to have 7/4, 16/9, and 9/5, they are too close<br/>together to<br/>&gt; sound evenly sequential without filling in 50+ total notes per<br/>octave.<br/>&gt; I&apos;d like to see every step in the scale be around 30-75 cents,<br/>ideally closer<br/>&gt; to 50 to make the scale even.  My thinking was to use 7/4 and 9/5,<br/>and<br/>&gt; leave 16/9 as a note I would get to by pitch bending the whole<br/>system to<br/>&gt; 4/3 or 16/9 or something else where 16/9 would then exist relative<br/>to<br/>&gt; the original 1/1.</p><p>Since HTT is basically otonal, it has close approximations of both<br/>7/4 and 16/9, but not 9/5.  If you want a just minor 7th chord, you<br/>would need to use 5/3, 1/1, 5/4, 3/2.</p><p>The smallest intervals in 29-HTT are 24 cents, and the smallest ones<br/>in the 41-tone superset are around 19 cents.</p><p>&gt; ...<br/>&gt; So in addition to help on the specifics, I&apos;m hoping to get feedback<br/>on<br/>&gt; whether people think my approach and attitude is reasonable.</p><p>It&apos;s indeed a struggle to find the one tuning that will &quot;do it all&quot;<br/>for you, so I hope that the above information may be helpful to you<br/>in some way.</p><p>Best,</p><p>--George</p></div><h3><a id=66333 href="#66333">ðŸ”—</a>Gene Ward Smith &#x3C;genewardsmith@coolgoose.com&#x3E;</h3><span>5/8/2006 5:02:03 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;Carl Lumma&quot; &lt;clumma@...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Last but not least, here&apos;s myna[23]<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; !<br/>&gt;  myna[23], 7-limit TOP tuning (Paul Erlich).<br/>&gt;  23<br/>&gt; !<br/>&gt;  40.73<br/>&gt;  81.46<br/>&gt;  187.7<br/>&gt;  228.43<br/>&gt;  269.16<br/>&gt;  309.89<br/>&gt;  350.62<br/>&gt;  391.35<br/>&gt;  497.59<br/>&gt;  538.32<br/>&gt;  579.05<br/>&gt;  619.78<br/>&gt;  880.51<br/>&gt;  701.24<br/>&gt;  807.48<br/>&gt;  848.21<br/>&gt;  888.94<br/>&gt;  929.67<br/>&gt;  970.4<br/>&gt;  1011.13<br/>&gt;  1117.37<br/>&gt;  1158.1<br/>&gt;  1198.83<br/>&gt; !<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Now if Gene cooks you a marvel[24], that&apos;ll wrap it up.<br/>&gt; Then you just have to play with these and pick your fav!</p><p>Here ya go:</p><p>! miracle24.scl<br/>Miracle[24] in 72-et tuning<br/>24<br/>!<br/>33.333333<br/>83.333333<br/>116.666667<br/>150.000000<br/>233.333333<br/>266.666667<br/>350.000000<br/>383.333333<br/>466.666667<br/>500.000000<br/>583.333333<br/>616.666667<br/>700.000000<br/>733.333333<br/>816.666667<br/>850.000000<br/>933.333333<br/>966.666667<br/>1000.000000<br/>1050.000000<br/>1083.333333<br/>1116.666667<br/>1166.666667<br/>1200.000000</p><p>Let&apos;s not forget Garibaldi[24].
