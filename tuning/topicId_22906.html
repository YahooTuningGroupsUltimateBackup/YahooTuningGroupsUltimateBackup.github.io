One simply performs the calculation specified<br/>in the notation I used.</p><p>So, for example,  to calculate the ratio for 2^(2/72), you<br/>simply raise 2 to the (2/72) power, which gives a ratio of<br/>~1.019440644.</p><p>Spreadsheet programs like Microsoft Excel will do this as<br/>notated; you simply put an equal sign = before the formula.</p><p>To do it on a hand calculator, calculate the fractional<br/>exponent first, then store it in memory, then enter &quot;2&quot;<br/>and hit the &quot;y^x&quot; key, then recall the stored memory value,<br/>hit the equal key and there&apos;s your answer.

Then<br/>&gt; &gt; we&apos;d have all the room we could possibly want for adding<br/>&gt; &gt; all that pitch-bend.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Now that&apos;s a thought!!<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; One extra byte - would have been a lot when MIDI was invented<br/>&gt; I suppose, but nowadays one is hardly waiting for the MIDI<br/>&gt; files to stream because of the number of bytes involved!<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Robert</p><p>That&apos;s the crux of what I was saying: the MIDI spec was<br/>established around 1983 and hasn&apos;t changed since.  Remember<br/>what kind of computers we were running back in &apos;83?<br/>Heck, I didn&apos;t even have one yet.</p><p>I saw a serious proposal about 7 years ago for ZIDI, which<br/>was a good idea for an update to the MIDI spec.  What ever<br/>happened to it?</p><p>I&apos;d say that MIDI is the aspect of modern music-making that<br/>is furthest behind the times... which is really too bad for<br/>me, because it&apos;s the method I use about 99% of the time.<br/>(Finale being the other 1%... but that&apos;s really MIDI too).</p><p>-monz<br/><a href="http://www.monz.org">http://www.monz.org</a><br/>&quot;All roads lead to n^0&quot;</p></div><h3>jpehrson@rcn.com</h3><span>5/19/2001 4:08:47 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In tuning@y..., &quot;monz&quot; &lt;joemonz@y...&gt; wrote:</p><p><a href="http://groups.yahoo.com/group/tuning/message/22950">http://groups.yahoo.com/group/tuning/message/22950</a></p><p>&gt; I hope to be able to create a Canasta page similar to my<br/>&gt; Blackjack page sometime this week, so there will be another<br/>&gt; web resource with some good info on it.
