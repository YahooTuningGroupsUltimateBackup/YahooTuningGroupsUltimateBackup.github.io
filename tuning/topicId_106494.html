I think there are no real answers<br/>and maybe my words let come more questions in your mind.</p><p>&gt; 1. Does a scale uniquely distinguish between octave and prime?</p><p>First of all: there are a lot of scales thar are not based on the<br/>interval on an ocatve (e.g. Bohlen-Pierce, Carlos alpha, beta, gamma).</p><p>I developed a nonoctave scale called the Equivocal Tuning that is<br/>an equal division of 2 octaves into 33 steps (more on this you can<br/>find at <a href="http://xenharmonic.wikispaces.com/33ed4">http://xenharmonic.wikispaces.com/33ed4</a> <a href="http://xenharmonic.wikispaces.com/33ed4">http://xenharmonic.wikispaces.com/33ed4</a>).</p><p>In this parcicular scale the exact octave lies between step 16 and<br/>step 17. So depending on the melodic and harmonic structure of a<br/>composition, sometimes step 16 plays the role of the octave and<br/>sometimes step 17 does it (for this reason I named the scale equivocal).<br/>This can happen one beneath the other in the same composition.</p><p>&gt; 2. Why are scales often described as linearly ordered sets?</p><p>Maybe it is the easiest way to describe a scale in ascending order<br/>of its pitches. If you take a look at the left-hand keyboard of an<br/>accordion where the pitches are layed out in fifths you will find it<br/>rather hard to play a melody (but more easy to play I-IV-V cadences).</p><p>&gt; 3. Are scales anchored on a special position in the tone system as the<br/>&gt; ancient Greek scales or medieval scales or not?</p><p>Music is sung or played on instruments. For singing there is no need<br/>for an absolute pitch to start the scale, but there is a pitch-range<br/>that is comfortable for the singer or singers and the pitch-range</p><p>of the composition should fit into the range the singers can sing<br/>(and singing should be fun, too).<br/>Historically, instruments were built on given base-pitches. If you take<br/>a baroque french-horn with no valves then the playable pitches are<br/>predefined by the overtone-series. If you take a violin with 4 strings<br/>tuned in perfect fifths to each other then you have more resonances<br/>and a fuller and richer tone if you play in the pythagorean scale.</p><p>Paganini used this by tuning his instrument a half step higher than<br/>the orchestra. So he played in sharp-scales and the orchestra played<br/>in flat-scales (e.g. a D on Paganini&apos;s violin was the same pitch as<br/>an E-flat on the violins of his orchestra). So of this Paganini&apos;s<br/>violin sounded more full as the violins of the orchestra and his<br/>soli got more volume (today we use microphones and mixing-consoles</p><p>so we do not need such tricks any more but for a long time such<br/>things were relevant).<br/>So it seems to me that there are very practical reasons for setting<br/>an absolute pitch being the base of a scale. Most musicians are<br/>really happy to be able to play a composition in the most easiest<br/>scale on their instruments. Only a few instruments like the guitar<br/>allow to play a composition in other keys simply by shifting the<br/>hand-position to another fret without any change in the fingerings.</p><p>And if you want your music to be played on real instruments then<br/>it should be rather easy to play. If you program your composition<br/>into a computer or into a barrel-organ so that it will be played<br/>automatically ... I do so because my playing-skills are rather low<br/>and I want to bring the music from my mind into this world.</p><p>For my Equivocal Tuning I choose an equal division of the steps<br/>because I designed the scale using a synthesizer that allowed me<br/>to build microtonal scales simply by entering a cent-value for the<br/>step-size of the key-scaling. So I started out at 73 cents because<br/>I only could enter whole numbers. Later on I used Scala do define<br/>my scale and refined the step to 72.72727... cents. On the other hand<br/>an equal division makes modulations to other keys in a composition<br/>much more easier than a pure-tuning. And I love modulations ;-)</p><p>In my opinion it is good to know the history of a scale. Having only<br/>12 pitches per octave makes building a keyboard-instrument much more<br/>simpler and cheaper then having 17 or 19 or 31 pitches per octave<br/>(that is one reason why our keyboards look like they do).<br/>For me as a trombone-player an F-sharp is slightly higher than a<br/>G-flat and I use different slide-positions on my trombone for that<br/>2 pitches. For a piano-player or a modern flute-player F-sharp and<br/>G-flat are the same pitch, that means are on the same key or played<br/>using the same fingering.</p><p>&gt; Are scales to be understood as a set of tones or as a sets of chromas?</p><p>For me, both melodic and harmonic structures are defined on the intervals<br/>between the pitches a given melody or chord is built of. For my<br/>compositions I use one ore more scales as the basic and I add pitches<br/>that do not belong to the scale wherever I feel I need them<br/>(maybe I do not really understand the difference between tones<br/>and chromas).</p><p>I hope I could explain my thoughts.</p><p>Cheers<br/>Birgit</p></div><h3><a id=106497 href="#106497">ðŸ”—</a>birgitmaus@...</h3><span>6/11/2015 12:08:59 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Hi Tobias,</p><p>I will try to answer your questions from my personal point ov view<br/>and based on my experiences.
