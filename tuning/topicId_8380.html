The kind of thing I&apos;m looking for is<br/>something that acts exactly as if it *IS* your system&apos;s regular MIDI outlet,<br/>but would be configurable with respect to tuning.  You&apos;d put it (logically)<br/>between your sequencer&apos;s output and the actual output to the MIDI or sound<br/>card.  By using pitch-bend messages and taking the tuning for each channel<br/>from some kind of configuration file.  It would allow one to &quot;tune&quot; each<br/>channel of the MIDI driver, and not have to embed pitch-bends in the<br/>data-stream being sent by your sequencer program.  You could control both<br/>external synths and the on-board &quot;General MIDI&quot; boards.</p><p>Anyone doing work on something like that?</p><p>Alternatively, are there configurable/tunable boards out there that can take<br/>a tuning configuration separate from the MIDI data itself?</p><p>I&apos;m thinking of something that could be used to function pretty much like<br/>the fully tunable synths, like the Yamaha TX81Z &amp; TX802, without a lot of<br/>pitch-bend hassle in the data stream.  I.e., to tune each channel separately.</p><p>John deLaubenfels&apos; JIRelay program sort of exemplifies what I have in mind,<br/>but works not on one-to-one channel, but (apparently) by mapping one input<br/>channel onto multiple output channels.  I would think that his technique<br/>might be modifiable to be used as a relay for one-pitch-per-channel tunable<br/>output, where the tuning of the channel is specified by a config file -- each<br/>channel could potentially use a separate configuration.</p><p>Thanks for any info...</p><p>&#x9;Rick</p></div><h3>Graham Breed &#x3C;gbreed@cix.compulink.co.uk&#x3E;</h3><span>2/9/2000 5:17:00 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>In-Reply-To: &lt;<a href="mailto:200002090310.TAA23361@scv3.apple.com">200002090310.TAA23361@scv3.apple.com</a>&gt;<br/>Rick McGowan wrote:</p><p>&gt;  You&apos;d put<br/>&gt; it (logically)  between your sequencer&apos;s output and the actual<br/>output<br/>&gt; to the MIDI or sound  card.
