The crychord, a harp-size contraption<br/>with only one string, was on its way down the<br/>loading ramp of a 24-foot moving truck and<br/>into a new home at Montclair State University.</p><p>Partch, a deeply eccentric, curmudgeonly figure<br/>who invented the 43-tone scale and spent his life<br/>in exile from the musical establishment, has<br/>gradually come to be considered one of the country&apos;s<br/>greatest musical thinkers since his death in 1974. But<br/>his music cannot be performed without his instruments.<br/>And his instruments -- like the quadrangularis reversum,<br/>an 8-foot-tall marimba with a double staircase of bars<br/>like an antebellum mansion, set in a frame of<br/>gracefully curved eucalyptus branches, -- take up<br/>a lot of space.</p><p>And space in this part of the world, Drummond has<br/>found, is not cheap. So for the fifth time this decade,<br/>Drummond, the 50-year-old co-director of an avant-garde<br/>music ensemble, Newband, and the official custodian of<br/>the Harry Partch Instrumentarium, was on the move.</p><p>Over the last week, he brought the collection, in four<br/>truckloads, from its last home, in a cardboard box<br/>factory in Rockland County, down Route 17 to Route 80<br/>to Valley Road, right here to a tidy campus on Normal<br/>Avenue. &quot;A great street for us, right?&quot; Drummond asked.</p><p>THE town of Montclair, which prides itself on<br/>being something of an arts center, is getting ready<br/>to be excited. The town&apos;s cultural affairs director,<br/>Paul Ellis, said he had not heard of Partch but<br/>welcomed his sound-sculptures, which number more<br/>than 30 and include a set of gongs made from the<br/>nose cones of propeller planes.</p><p>Montclair, Ellis pointed out, is home to one of<br/>the finest municipal art museums around, the Montclair<br/>Art Museum, which has two resident theater companies<br/>and scads of boutiques, art-house movie theaters and<br/>a folk music club.</p><p>And as if that were not enough, Montclair State itself<br/>is home to the Yogi Berra Museum.</p><p>For Drummond and the instruments, the road has been<br/>a long one. A former student of Partch&apos;s who, at 16,<br/>played the eucal blossom in the master&apos;s ensemble,<br/>Drummond became the de facto guardian of the instruments<br/>in 1991.</p><p>At first, he found space for them in a loft on West<br/>31st Street in Manhattan near an entrance to the Lincoln<br/>Tunnel. Soon after, Drummond and his wife moved to Nyack,<br/>N.Y., and found a home for the instruments in Nyack High<br/>School. In 1993, Newband was named ensemble-in-residence<br/>at the State University of New York in Purchase,<br/>N.Y., but when a new music dean came in last year,<br/>Drummond said he was told that the music department<br/>needed the Partch room for other purposes.</p><p>So, last August, Newband signed a lease on a piece of<br/>the Quality Carton Corporation factory in Sloatsburg,<br/>N.Y. The space was ideal -- more than 3,600 square feet,<br/>and it came with a loading dock -- but Newband could not<br/>afford the rent of $1,800 a month.</p><p>Drummond began shopping for a new institution. When<br/>Montclair State, within an hour or two&apos;s driving distance<br/>for the dozen or so members of Newband, expressed interest<br/>in June, Drummond leaped at the opportunity.</p><p>The new quarters are not quite ideal -- the collection<br/>is now divided up into three rooms in two different buildings,<br/>one of which is crammed floor to ceiling. The quadrangularis<br/>and the boo, a pyramid-shaped bamboo marimba painted in<br/>bright colors, are being stored in a conference room<br/>because Drummond does not expect to use them in the<br/>next couple of years.</p><p>But having found a home for a national treasure has<br/>given Drummond an enormous sense of relief.</p><p>Partch, who often incorporated hobo and vagabond<br/>imagery into his highly theatrical, percussive music,<br/>was himself a legendary wanderer. Over the course of<br/>40 years, he lugged his instruments to Wisconsin,<br/>Illinois, and Petaluma and Sausalito, Calif., and a<br/>converted laundry in Los Angeles before settling in<br/>San Diego. Partch spent a spell in New York in the 1940&apos;s,<br/>Drummond said, but got scared out.</p><p>&quot;He declared that you&apos;d have to be luckier than<br/>he was to make it here,&quot; Drummond said.</p></div><h3>Paul Hahn &#x3C;Paul-Hahn@xxxxxxx.xxxxx.xxxx&#x3E;</h3><span>8/11/1999 8:00:19 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>[Partch instruments now residing in Montclair, NJ]</p><p>Montclair is also the home of the Catgut Acoustical Society, an<br/>organization devoted to researching the acoustics of (mainly stringed)<br/>musical instruments, and perpetrators of the New Violin Octet, another<br/>of my pet interests.
