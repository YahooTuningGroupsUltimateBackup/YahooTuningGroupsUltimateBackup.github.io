It<br/>seems that the writer didn&apos;t really &quot;get it&quot; as far as what the tuning does.<br/>She mentioned that there was &quot;something&apos; in a passage or two, but never<br/>delved into the emotional level established by the pieces in the various<br/>renditions.<br/>   What I don&apos;t understand is why a reviewer would write that Enid&apos;s playing<br/>didn&apos;t sound like Horowitz&apos;s.  Of course it doesn&apos;t,  but so what?  This<br/>review segued from a book on &quot;Solving the Puzzle&quot; to a recording, and in so<br/>doing, the reviewer segued from white-washing a partialy understood concept<br/>to critiquing a performers rendition.  And to choose the Chopin for<br/>comparison!  That was the only temperament we used on &quot;6 Degrees&quot; that I<br/>specifically said was an avante-gard (as if bending Steinways around is<br/>normal, these days) and shouldn&apos;t be taken as a standard anything.<br/>          What she also doesn&apos;t understand is that pianos don&apos;t &quot;learn&quot; ET,<br/>and present a lot of problems when their temperaments are changed.  That is<br/>totally wrong. The major temperaments require no more than 6 or 8 cents<br/>deviation on certain notes,some up, some down, from ET.  This is far less<br/>change than most pianos suffer from climate changes during the year. I<br/>consistantly change temperaments on pianos and their stability is fine.  The<br/>remark about restringing after the Meantone failed to mention that those<br/>piano strings had been on stage for 20 years, and were going to be restrung,<br/>anyway.<br/>   As long as reviewers are looking for a particularly different tree, the<br/>temperaments will remain an unseen forest.  &lt;sigh&gt;<br/>Regards,<br/>Ed Foote<br/>Nashville, Tn.</p></div><h3><a id=31611 href="#31611">ðŸ”—</a>jpehrson2 &#x3C;jpehrson@rcn.com&#x3E;</h3><span>12/16/2001 7:00:01 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In tuning@y..., a440a@a... wrote:</p><p><a href="/tuning/topicId_31604.html#31604">/tuning/topicId_31604.html#31604</a></p><p>&gt;           What she also doesn&apos;t understand is that pianos<br/>don&apos;t &quot;learn&quot; ET, and present a lot of problems when their<br/>temperaments are changed.

I didn&apos;t realize that piano soundboards were<br/>sentient &quot;psychic&quot; beings.  Perhaps we should put them through grade<br/>school... or at least &quot;reform&quot; school...  Very strange.</p><p>The<br/>&gt; remark about restringing after the Meantone failed to mention that<br/>those piano strings had been on stage for 20 years, and were going to<br/>be restrung, anyway.</p><p>This really was such excessively bad information.  It&apos;s kind of like<br/>the people that think that any kind of &quot;preparation&quot; for a prepared<br/>piano piece will ruin a piano for life...</p><p>Joe Pehrson</p></div>
