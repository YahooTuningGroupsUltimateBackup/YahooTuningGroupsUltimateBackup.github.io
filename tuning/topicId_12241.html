However, I suspect he dealt only with<br/>rational triangles. Most historians of mathematics consider the<br/>Pythagorean (not necessarily by Pythagoras) discovery of the<br/>irrationality of the square root of 2 as the defining moment in number<br/>theory.</p><p>However, the history of logistic or arithmentic/algebra is not as clear<br/>as that of geometry. The Babylonians could approximate square and cube<br/>roots quite accurately and undoubtedly, the so-called &quot;Euclidean&quot;<br/>algorithm and something like Continued Fractions was known very early.</p><p>I think this is pretty good evidence that Aristoxenos did not invent<br/>equal-temperament or intend to. It&apos;s quite clear that if he had,<br/>Eratosthenes and Ptolemy would not have presented his tunings in as<br/>grotesquely distorted form as they appear in the Harmonics.</p><p>--John</p></div>
