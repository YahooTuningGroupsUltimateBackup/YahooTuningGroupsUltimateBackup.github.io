I swear you have a little &quot;gremlin&quot; tuner standing behind that piano<br/>and tuning the &quot;E&quot; lower and lower, bit by bit.</p><p>It&apos;s great you learned how to post stuff like that.  I would also like to<br/>learn someday... Also, the sound quality is great.  I didn&apos;t realize,<br/>though,  that people could make sounds through their mouths like that... I<br/>just assumed music was always made with oscillators (??)</p><p>_____________<br/>Joseph Pehrson</p></div>
