However, to access the group&apos;s website,<br/>(formerly, &quot;<a href="http://www.egroups.com/group/---------">http://www.egroups.com/group/---------</a>&quot; and now,<br/>&quot;<a href="http://groups.yahoo.com/group/-------">http://groups.yahoo.com/group/-------</a>&quot;), you have to &quot;convert&quot;<br/>you account, which really just consists of giving them your<br/>egroups ID and Password and establishing a Yahoo! ID and<br/>password (if you don&apos;t have one already).</p><p>If you head for the group&apos;s website using either of the two<br/>addresses above, you will automatically be taken to a page<br/>which describes all this and links to the &quot;conversion wizard&quot;<br/>(which you can access directly here:<br/><a href="http://beta.groups.yahoo.com/convwiz">http://beta.groups.yahoo.com/convwiz</a>)</p><p>there&apos;s also a help page:<br/><a href="http://help.yahoo.com/help/us/groups/groups-34.html">http://help.yahoo.com/help/us/groups/groups-34.html</a></p><p>best and cordial wishes</p><p>Lawrence Ball</p><p>PS this information from Larry Cuba on Iotacenter group (&quot;visual music&quot;)</p><p>PPS see also yahoo info below (courtesy Tim Conrardy)</p><p>What does it mean to convert my account?<br/>Converting your account associates your eGroups with a Yahoo ID.<br/>Who should convert their accounts?</p><p>Former eGroups users -- You will need to enter your eGroups email<br/>address and password, and either associate it with an existing Yahoo!<br/>ID or register for a new one.<br/>If you just want to participate by email, you don&apos;t have to do<br/>anything to change the way you interact with the service.</p><p>If you want to access all of your Group&apos;s web features, simply follow<br/>the steps on our Yahoo!

ID. All you have to do is use our<br/>Conversion Wizard.</p><p>Do I have to convert my account?<br/>No. You only need to convert your account if you need use the web<br/>site to manage your Group, or to access web features that are<br/>designated for members only by your Group owner.</p><p>For example, email-only subscribers can read and post to their Groups<br/>without having to log in to the web site, so they won&apos;t need to link<br/>their accounts to a Yahoo! ID. However, those who normally post using<br/>the web form would have to go through the Conversion Wizard process.</p><p>I have multiple accounts with eGroups. Can I convert them all?</p><p>Yes!
