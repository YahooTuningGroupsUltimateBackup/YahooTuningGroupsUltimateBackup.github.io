He remarked<br/>that I wasn&apos;t tuning an equal temperament, was I? I said that was probably<br/>true as I wanted purer fifths and that I didn&apos;t much care what happened to<br/>the thirds as et made them so rattly anyway, just let &apos;em vary a bit from<br/>key to key.<br/>He said my temperament sound to him like the Werkmeister III temperament and<br/>told me that he always tuned his organs to that intonation. He proceeded to<br/>demonstrate and it was clearto me that I had intuited something awfully like<br/>that tuning.<br/>I notice more and more, that recent piano recordings sound suspiciously<br/>sweeter to my ears than those of years ago, and I just wonder if tungers in<br/>general aren&apos;t taking a more &quot;spiritual&quot; rather than &quot;religious&quot; approach to<br/>tuning. They may say they tune in et and profess it, but are they really? I<br/>think not.<br/>Most of us have a lazy streak somewhere in our systems, and if ya tink about<br/>it, tuning a 12tet is damned hard work. I find tuning a &quot;well temperament&quot;<br/>much easier and it sounds a bunch nicer, so I do it.<br/>While we&apos;re at it, do some of the rest of ya notice that the tunings on a<br/>lotta synths are pretty poor excuses for et?<br/>And just so ya know, I&apos;m constantly being told by pianists that my tuning is<br/>&quot;sweet&quot; and they want more of it.</p></div><h3><a id=8340 href="#8340">ðŸ”—</a>Paul H.

Which synths did you have<br/>&gt;in mind?<br/>&gt;Well, my Kawai K5 and Roland SC55 are pretty well matched and are very<br/>close, but nevertheless, slightly different. They both have<br/>constantly-accelerating beats as you move chromatically, but they&apos;re not<br/>identical. I admit, for those two, ya kinda hafta look hard and make<br/>simultaneous comparisons to catch the differences.<br/>However, on my Turtle Beach Tropez sound card and my Prophet 2002 Sampler,<br/>anything goes. They just sawed off the tops<br/>of those 12tet tables and never planed &apos;em.<br/>And that got me curious as to just how they build those tables, so I looked<br/>up the data on the old Radio Shack 276-1780 &quot;top octave synthesizer&quot; chip.<br/>So, at some point, there has to be some digital rounding-off into 1&apos;s and<br/>0&apos;s. I wonder if something equivalent to &quot;dithering&quot; is ever used to taylor<br/>the final result.<br/>Thanks for prompting  me to obsess awhile. &lt;grin?<br/>Jay<br/>-------------------------<br/>ONElist Sponsor ----------------------------<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;Shop for your Valentine at eGroups.<br/>&gt;&lt;a href=&quot; <a href="http://clickme.onelist.com/ad/SparksValentine6">http://clickme.onelist.com/ad/SparksValentine6</a> &quot;&gt;Click Here&lt;/a&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;You do not need web access to participate.
