Here<br/>&gt;I would emphasize that it is not the tuning alone which is<br/>&gt;&quot;Xeno-Gothic&quot; -- Euler apparently proposed a similar if not identical<br/>&gt;arrangement in 1739 (according to Barbour) for a kind of 5-limit just<br/>&gt;intonation</p><p>I was not aware that Euler had proposed this 24-tone schismic tuning, but<br/>Helmholtz also advocated it later.</p></div>
