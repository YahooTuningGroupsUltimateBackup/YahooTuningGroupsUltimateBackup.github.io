Classical<br/>&gt;music when it&apos;s played without even tempered instruments is<br/>&gt;auto-just-tuned typically by musicians. When you hear a Beethoven<br/>&gt;String Quartet it&apos;s just-tuned!</p><p>I beg to differ with Jeff here. The majority of renditions of Beethoven<br/>string quartets I&apos;ve heard show virtually no deference to the just tuning of<br/>chords.</p><p>&gt; Author: Kyle Gann (<a href="mailto:kgann@earthlink.net">kgann@earthlink.net</a>)<br/>&gt;                        Subject: Cherished myth</p><p>&gt;        Good classical musicians may play in tune, but that does<br/>&gt;*not* mean that they play in anything approaching just intonation.<br/>&gt;It&apos;s often said that old, European string quartets play in just<br/>&gt;intonation, and if it was true, it hasn&apos;t been in decades. I have an<br/>&gt;experiment I do with music students, including at conservatories: I<br/>&gt;play a droneon G and ask them to sing a purely in-tune, beatless B.<br/>&gt;In<br/>&gt;every case, I have invariably gotten a pure, ET, 400-cent B. When I<br/>&gt;gradually lead them down 14 cents to the 5/4 B, they are surprised to<br/>&gt;learn there&apos;s a pitch &quot;notch&quot; there. How can they play in just<br/>&gt;intonation if they&apos;ve never heard the interval in their lives?</p><p>I&apos;m glad Kyle could dispell this myth. Gerald Eskelin reported virtually the<br/>same phenomenon on this list. Jeff Harrington better recalibrate his beliefs<br/>to reality!</p><p>&gt;And there<br/>&gt;might be an exceptional string quartet here and there, but the belief<br/>&gt;that classical performers gravitate toward just intonation hasn&apos;t been<br/>&gt;true in my lifetime. You can tell just by listening.</p><p>Right, Kyle, though thankfully, performers of Renaissance music have been<br/>gradually learning to gravitate toward the more just-like tuning appropriate<br/>for that era.</p></div><h3>Joseph Pehrson &#x3C;pehrson@pubmedia.com&#x3E;</h3><span>9/15/2000 11:41:29 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@egroups.com">tuning@egroups.com</a>, &quot;Paul H.

The funny thing<br/>is, some of the early-music people I&apos;ve met tune to pure consonances<br/>or<br/>some version of meantone (in the case of keyboard music), but do so<br/>intuitively, and can&apos;t really explain to me what tuning they&apos;re<br/>using.<br/>If I found someone who could give me specifics, I&apos;d add that<br/>information to my web page.</p></div>
