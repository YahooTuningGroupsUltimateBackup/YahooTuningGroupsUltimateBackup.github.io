They took on the task of working up 7 new pieces in three days.<br/>&gt; Some of the pieces were extremely difficult. For my piece, which was<br/>&gt; medium-difficult and only 7-8 mins long, they spent about 90 minutes of<br/>&gt; hard work on it, with me present. I would have liked another half-hour,<br/>&gt; though I&apos;m really not complaining about the job they did. Other tougher<br/>&gt; pieces had more than 3 hours spent on them with the composers, plus<br/>&gt; whatever time the Hilliards had spent before coming here (they had the<br/>&gt; scores for about a month, but of course they were very busy - they did at<br/>&gt; least read through everything and do some preliminary work before getting<br/>&gt; here). In any case, two or three of the composers wrote foolishly<br/>&gt; difficult pieces, unsuited to the group, and in one case one movement of a<br/>&gt; multi-movement piece had to be left out because the group couldn&apos;t get it<br/>&gt; prepared in time.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; My point is, they might be terrific musicians and the world&apos;s greatest<br/>&gt; singers of a certain kind, but even 12-tet music, if written in a harmonic<br/>&gt; style they&apos;re not familiar with, can pose very difficult pitch problems<br/>&gt; for singers (and I&apos;m not even going to broach the subject of rhythm - oops<br/>&gt; I just did). Only one of the four members of the Hilliard ensemble who<br/>&gt; were here has perfect pitch sensitive to tiny fractions of a semitone -<br/>&gt; Rogers Covey-Crump, who also writes the tuning notes as companion to their<br/>&gt; CDs on the HilliardLIVE label. To get choral or vocal works done precisely<br/>&gt; in new tunings won&apos;t take simply the best singers, it will take people<br/>&gt; willing to dedicate a LOT of time to ear-training in the new systems. With<br/>&gt; over 100 concerts a year, the Hilliards or similar professional groups<br/>&gt; won&apos;t be able--or even interested, I imagine--to put in that sort of time.<br/>&gt; Unless you could pay them for a year. The really good singers are too busy<br/>&gt; succesfully earning their living, and the pretty good singers are too busy<br/>&gt; trying to become really good, really succesful singers.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Cheers --Jon</p><p>Interesting. I&apos;d love to get one of my pieces performed by such an ensemble. The point I was<br/>making initially was that I reckon they could sing any of the existing (mostly tonal) repertoire<br/>with ease. I agree with your point about the microtonal repertoire.</p><p>You&apos;re absolutely right about the singers moving along the assembly line. My early music trio,<br/>Solsequium, is about to lose its soprano who has a wonderful voice to a college . She hopes to<br/>&apos;make it&apos; in the world of opera. If only I could persuade her to join &apos;the cause&apos;. But every time<br/>I mention microtonality I get the &quot;you&apos;ve grown another head&quot; look.</p><p>Best Wishes.</p></div>
