But I worry that it would not elucidate<br/>anything for a novice.  Here is the text:</p><p>The arithmetical concept of roots is often encountered in discussions about tuning.</p><p>How are roots related to equal divisions?</p><p>To divide an interval a into b equal parts, that is, to calculate the size of the interval that,<br/>when repeated b times, would add up to a, calculate the bth root of a. The equivalent<br/>expression is to take a to the (1/b)th power.</p><p>Why roots and powers? Because intervals are proportions, which you must multiply in<br/>order to &quot;add&quot;.</p><p>Take a simple example: what&apos;s half of an octave? Well, an octave means &quot;twice the<br/>frequency&quot; or &quot;2 times whatever you have&quot; or &quot;2 to 1&quot; or simply &quot;2&quot;. (The 2 itself has no<br/>units, because they cancel out: to calculate that octave between A-220 and A-440, we<br/>divide 440 Hertz by 220 Hertz and get... plain ol&apos; 2.) If an octave means &quot;twice&quot;, then<br/>what&apos;s half of &quot;twice&quot;?</p><p>It isn&apos;t once...because two onces is just another once!</p><p>It&apos;s the square root of 2! Try it: The b&#x8;&#x1A;2 *multiplied* twice is b&#x8;&#x1A;2*b&#x8;&#x1A;2 = 2. (Note that b&#x8;&#x1A;2<br/>*added* twice would be 2b&#x8;&#x1A;2.)</p><p>--</p><p>It&apos;s confusing and takes a while to get if you were never good at math, yes, but the real<br/>problem is that I don&apos;t really know the best way (or any non-slippery language) to talk<br/>about addition turning into multiplication and multiplication turning to powers, these<br/>transforms which bridge the gap between ratio-world and logarithmic-world.</p><p>Feel free to add to or modify the growing body of knowledge that is the xenharmonic wiki.<br/>Do note that it does not aspire to be an encyclopedia, and that original research and new<br/>attempts at making sense of the tuning world are kinda the whole point...!</p><p>My my,<br/>Jacob</p></div>
