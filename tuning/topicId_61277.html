When the ship&apos;s  &gt;sonar detects an incoming torpedo, the transducers simultaneously  &gt;fire an acoustic shock wave of such intensity that the torpedo either  &gt;detonates early or is disabled by the pulse&apos;s crushing force,  &gt;according to the Defence Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA),  &gt;which is funding the project.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;But these are no ordinary loudspeakers: instead of having a  &gt;membranous diaphragm that can vibrate in response to a range of audio  &gt;frequencies, each of the devices has a ram-like cylindrical metal  &gt;armature at its centre. This is projected outwards by electromagnets  &gt;at very high speed, producing a shock wave. The array can be fired as  &gt;many times as needed.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;When the six rows of 60 transducers on each side of the ship fire at  &gt;once, the cumulative action should generate a &quot;destructive pressure  &gt;pulse capable of disabling an enemy&apos;s torpedo&quot;, according to DARPA.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;Exactly how the system works is shrouded in military secrecy. But by  &gt;making a speaker several times larger than the wavelength of the  &gt;sound wave required, a tightly focused beam can be produced in front  &gt;of the speaker. This is because beam width is partly determined by  &gt;the aperture of the source - a bigger loudspeaker focuses sound in a  &gt;smaller area. (New Scientist, 9 September 2000, p 38). And the  &gt;combined size of the array makes for a very large speaker indeed.  &gt;This focusing would allow the array to precisely target incoming  &gt;torpedoes. In addition, the beam can be steered in different  &gt;directions - probably by slightly altering the phase of the applied  &gt;signals - a technique that is widely used to steer radio waves using  &gt;side-by-side antennas. So torpedoes homing in on the ship&apos;s wake from  &gt;many directions can be targeted (see Diagram).<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;So far, the system&apos;s developers, Anteon Technologies of Fairfax,  &gt;Virginia, and BAE Systems of Farnborough, UK, have only built one  &gt;transducer. But encouraged by software simulations that show the  &gt;array should work, they plan to press ahead with a one-quarter-scale  &gt;test rig.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;If it reaches the stage of testing in the open ocean, however, the  &gt;developers are likely to come into conflict with marine biologists.  &gt;They have evidence that whales blasted by frequent acoustic signals  &gt;from submarine or ship sonar appear to develop symptoms of  &gt;decompression sickness, and die. (New Scientist, 11 October 2003, p 10).<br/>&gt;&iuml;&iquest;&half;The torpedo detonates early or is disabled by the pulse&apos;s crushing  &gt;force&iuml;&iquest;&half;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;But neither DARPA, Anteon, nor BAE Systems was willing to respond to  &gt;questions about the array&apos;s proposed energy levels and any threat to  &gt;marine mammals they might pose.<br/>&gt; From issue 2520 of New Scientist magazine, 06 October 2005, page 32<br/>&gt;Printable version Email to a friend RSS Feed &gt;<br/>&gt;[This message contained attachments]<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;  &gt;</p><p>--<br/>Kraig Grady<br/>North American Embassy of Anaphoria Island &lt;<a href="http://anaphoria.com/">http://anaphoria.com/</a>&gt;<br/>The Wandering Medicine Show<br/>KXLU &lt;<a href="http://www.kxlu.com/main.html">http://www.kxlu.com/main.html</a>&gt; 88.9 FM Wed 8-9 pm Los Angeles</p></div><h3><a id=61304 href="#61304">ðŸ”—</a>Carl Lumma &#x3C;clumma@yahoo.com&#x3E;</h3><span>10/10/2005 12:56:35 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>&gt; one can only imagine what such a device would do to mammals<br/>&gt; in the area and for how far.</p><p>I hope they never make this thing, but I&apos;m also worried about<br/>the sonar they (and everyone) already have.
