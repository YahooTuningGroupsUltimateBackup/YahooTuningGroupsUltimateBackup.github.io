The<br/>first, the (apparently) erroneous use by you of a DX-7,</p><p>As to be expected, the part that &quot;Dean Drummond&quot; was sanctioning me (and the AFMM) for using a synthesizer was ignored by Jon.  IT NEVER HAPPENED.  The whole thing never occurred.  Jon Szanto missed his chance to do something about it by removing this fantasy of Brian&apos;s from his web site.  It is a shame that the AFMM has never had any chance to use a Partch original, but it is worse to marginalize the good work that we do.</p><p>What is missing from Corporeal Meadows is the AFMM.  It has premiered several works by Harry Partch, exactly for the correct instrumentation as in the &quot;Li Po&quot; (in Italy, France, and Switzerland).  It premiered &quot;Ulysses Departs...&quot; in its original version (for trumpet, double bass and boobams) and &quot;December 1942.&quot;  Danlee Mitchell, Partch&apos;s heir, once lamented how, unfortunately, I didn&apos;t have Harry&apos;s actual voice (how icky!)  When Jon Szanto, in his role with the Partch Foundation, belittles the first reproduced Kithara, sight unseen but with an excellent recording, it translates to me that there is nothing Jon/Danlee will support other than the actual original instruments they touched and played.</p><p>In depth discussions of the value, practically, historically, and technically for a synthesizer were detailed on the list in past posts and should be in the archives.</p><p>To even hint that the AFMM in not fulfilling its responsibility to present a greatest American pioneer of microtonal music would be insulting.  To be marginalized by the very organizations that have a monopoly on Partch&apos;s instruments is even worse. To think that an AFMM performance cheapens Partch&apos;s music is to cheapen Partch&apos;s music in the mind.  Musicianship is a powerful force, and may trump using the instruments as props.</p><p>Johnny Reinhard<br/>Director<br/>American Festival of Microtonal Music, Inc.</p></div><h3><a id=21312 href="#21312">ðŸ”—</a>JSZANTO@ADNC.COM</h3><span>4/20/2001 8:47:41 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Johnny,</p><p>--- In tuning@y..., Afmmjr@a... wrote:<br/>&gt; In a message dated 4/20/01 3:00:14 AM Eastern Daylight Time,<br/>jszanto@a... writes:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Two mentions (one included in a reply-quote of the same material).<br/>&gt; The first, the (apparently) erroneous use by you of a DX-7,</p><p>I wrote this to you *privately*.
