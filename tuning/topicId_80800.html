This was something that Ivor would have demonstrated either with recordings of his amplifying clavichord or organ, or with sets of metallophones.   While I personally don&apos;t know if 17 is the precise answer to the question, I&apos;m fairly well convinced the answer would have to be in the neighborhood of 17,  i.e. with scale steps somewhere midway between those of 12 and 24, if due only to critical band considerations.</p><p>Daniel Wolf</p></div><h3><a id=80837 href="#80837">ðŸ”—</a>Mark Rankin &#x3C;markrankin95511@...&#x3E;</h3><span>2/10/2009 8:31:22 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Kraig et al,<br/>&nbsp;<br/>The &quot;Subject&quot; box spells Ivor&apos;s last name, Darreg, correctly, but the e-mails thereafter spell it&nbsp;incorrectly, several times, as Derreg.<br/>&nbsp;<br/>It may amuse some younger tuning listers to learn that Ivor&apos;s Darreg&apos;s name used to be<br/>Ivor Gerrard.&nbsp; First he reversed Gerrard, yielding Ivor Drarreg, then later he shortened&nbsp;<br/>Ivor Drarreg to Ivor Darreg because he thought Ivor Drarreg sounded unnaturally strange and hard for people to remember.&nbsp; Ivor was eccentric, there&apos;s no doubt about that!<br/>&nbsp;<br/>-- Mark Rankin&nbsp;</p><p>--- On Mon, 2/9/09, Kraig Grady &lt;kraiggrady@...&gt; wrote:</p><p>From: Kraig Grady &lt;kraiggrady@...&gt;<br/>Subject: [tuning] Re:Darreg&apos;s assertion that 17-ET has the &quot;ULTIMATE DISSONANCE&quot;<br/>To: <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a><br/>Date: Monday, February 9, 2009, 11:56 PM</p><p>Hell Frank!<br/>I don&apos;t think anyone believes what Derrig says unconditionally, nor<br/>anyone else for that matter.
