Fundamentally, I think he&apos;s<br/>absolutely right;  you really can&apos;t understand any tuning without putting it into the<br/>perspective of other tunings.  I agree with that.</p><p>As with a lot of things though, Brian overdoes it (or he does in his commentary at<br/>least;  I don&apos;t know to what degree he really believes his opinionated commentary).<br/>He once told me something of the nature that only four people in the world are<br/>qualified to lecture about microtonality because they are the only ones who have done<br/>a lot of composition in wide variety of tunings.  He then followed that up with a<br/>comment that you can&apos;t become a linguist by studying the letter E.</p><p>I think a better analogy would be that each tuning is a language rather than a single<br/>letter.  I would then agree that you can&apos;t become a master linguist without studying<br/>lots of languages, but you can become an expert on a single language and make<br/>significant expressions in that language.</p><p>&gt; I believe this is an area where McLaren and Paul Erlich differ<br/>&gt; strongly.  McLaren views all music as a process of &quot;acculturation&quot;<br/>&gt; and doesn&apos;t feel that just ratios are particularly significant as an<br/>&gt; audible &quot;stopping point&quot; other than their establishment in a<br/>&gt; cultural sense.</p><p>Brian and I have been discussing this topic over the past few days, and it appears<br/>that he and I largely agree on the topic, although he takes a contrarian&apos;s attitude<br/>toward JI, whereas I take a more positive angle on the topic.</p><p>I believe, and I think Brian agrees, that beatless consonance is a clearly-audible<br/>phenomenon in sustained chordal harmony.  &quot;Sustained chordal harmony&quot; here includes<br/>typical SATB chorales or sustained melodic-accompaniment chords, for example.<br/>However, we also agree that although that tuning ideal has a clearly-audible effect<br/>under such circumstances, there&apos;s no clear evidence that peoples&apos; ears actually<br/>prefer the sound of beatless of consonance, and there are clearly many other<br/>influences on what gives us the impression of pitch being right.  Examples include<br/>the desire to make two identical sized intervals in melodic sequence the same size,<br/>wanting to raise a leading tone to make a stronger lead to the tonic.  Probably more<br/>importantly though, there are only so many sustained chords in real-world music, and<br/>when notes move by at normal speed, beatless consonance is a heck of a lot harder to<br/>even detect, much less prefer.  And of course vibrato complicates the question even<br/>further.</p><p>So when Brian gives you the impression that the JI concept is all a load of<br/>meaningless tripe, what he probably means is that it is audibly significant in<br/>sustained block chords, but as music departs from that pardigm, its meaningfulness<br/>rapidly gets overwhelmed by other tuning ideals.</p></div><h3><a id=24880 href="#24880">ðŸ”—</a>Gary Morrison &#x3C;mr88cet@austin.rr.com&#x3E;</h3><span>6/11/2001 5:23:48 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>&gt; That seems contradictory, Joseph.

Don&apos;t think anything until you&apos;ve<br/>composed in a phi-based or root-of-any-n-other-than-two temperament.<br/>Don&apos;t think of anything until you&apos;ve composed with harmonic, non-<br/>harmonic, and mixed harmonic-non-harmonic timbres. Don&apos;t think of<br/>anything until you&apos;ve composed in total microtonal polyphony with one<br/>tuning to each channel. Don&apos;t think of anything until you&apos;ve produced<br/>at least a dozen cds. Only then can you even think about thinking<br/>about micrtonality on a respectable level. mcl.</p></div>
