In fact, the Basques seem to be genetically distinct<br/>among European populations.</p><p>It is possible that there are some links to Irish populations, assuming the<br/>legend of Mil Espainne and the migration from Spain is true, as the Spaniards<br/>in Roman times were a mixture of Celts and Iberians (ancestors of the Basques,<br/>etc.).</p><p>Welsh, however, is a P-Celtic or Brythonic language related to Gaulish and<br/>what the elite Picts spoke and not  Q-Celtic or Goidelic as are Irish, Manx,<br/>Scots, etc.<br/>So, it seems unlikely that they would be closely related to the Basques.<br/>Furthermore, it is known that many Celtic Britons migrated from what is now<br/>Belgium and Northern France in the early centuries BCE.</p><p>For what it&apos;s worth, Neanderthals seem to have survived in southern Spain<br/>long after they had been replaced by modern humans from Africa via the<br/>Near East. Comparisons of mitochondrial DNA sequences indicate that<br/>Neanderthals probably did not interbreed with modern humans to any<br/>detectable extent and Y chromosome data indicates that all extant<br/>humans are more recent than Neanderthals.</p><p>There is a very embarrassing situation at the moment re DNA tests in<br/>the Near East. A paper published in the September issue of  Human Immunology<br/>which shows that Jews and Palestinians are closely related genetically has been<br/>withdrawn because of political comments by the author. The data are not<br/>in dispute, and contrary to some Palestinian propaganda, European Jews<br/>did originate in Palestine.</p><p>There have been many suggestions that American Indian languages<br/>are related to Welsh, Hebrew, Berber, Punic, etc. None have been<br/>shown to be true, though there may be a few recent loan words from<br/>Celtic via French in Alqonkin (bata  (?) boat, from Fr. bateau, Gaulish bata).</p><p>A retired Harvard zoologist named Barry Fell  has been pushing these ideas<br/> in his books America B.C. and Saga America.  They make rather amusing<br/>reading, especially his translation of petroglyphs which he alleges show that<br/>Arabic-speaking Hebrews ran a Naval Academy in the middle of the<br/>Nevada desert.</p><p>Hopi is a Uto-Aztecan language, related to Paiute, Tarahumara,<br/>Nahuatl, Huichol, etc. such as Gaelic  Its roots and verbal system is<br/>are very different from Indo-European languages, i.e, verbs conjugated<br/>for degrees of validity or affirmation rather than tense). According to<br/>Whorf, there is a form called the &quot;impotential&quot; which expresses teleological<br/>ineffectiveness. An example would be &quot;he escaped, but was recaptured, &quot;<br/>or I already ate,  but am still hungry.&quot;</p><p>Some linguists do think that Na-Dene is related to Ket and the rest of<br/>the Yeneseian languages (now extinct) and the Sino-Tibetan languages.<br/>I&apos;m not sure what the consensus is, but I think that the relation of Ket to<br/>Sino-Tibetan is accepted, but that the wider relations to Na-Dene,<br/>Burushaski, Hurrian, Hattic, North Caucasian, Etruscan and Sumerian<br/>are not.  My files are several years old, alas.</p><p>Genetically, Na-Dene speakers seem more closely related to North<br/>Chinese and East Siberian peoples than to Eskimo-Aleut or other<br/>North Eurasians. However, there is some evidence for at least one<br/>migration of Eurasian peoples  similar to the Jomon (proto-Ainu), and<br/>other North Asian-North European groups very early into North America.<br/>The evidence is still rather poor for this, but it would explain why<br/>the Kennewick man looks like Patrick Stewart (of Star Trek, the Next<br/>Generation, Dune, etc.). In any case, the skeleton is far too important<br/>scientifically to be allowed to be reburied or destroyed.</p><p>--John</p></div><h3>genewardsmith &#x3C;genewardsmith@juno.com&#x3E;</h3><span>12/5/2001 9:24:53 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In tuning@y..., John Chalmers &lt;JHCHALMERS@U...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt; Comparisons of mitochondrial DNA sequences indicate that<br/>&gt; Neanderthals probably did not interbreed with modern humans to any<br/>&gt; detectable extent and Y chromosome data indicates that all extant<br/>&gt; humans are more recent than Neanderthals.</p><p>Has the Meanderthal data been generally accepted?
