(My soundcard<br/>has two synths, one of which producew regular waves for some voices, which<br/>are easy to count, and one which produces the more lifelike ones that are<br/>much harder to count since the wave shape varies so much as the note<br/>continues. so this is for the basic synth).</p><p>Method was to show high resolution (individual samples shown as steps),<br/>count 10 waves, measure exactly, use that to predict where the 100th wave<br/>will cross the 0 position, go to that place and find exact crossover pos for<br/>100th wave, and use that to predict 1000th wave, and check that, by which<br/>time one has a pretty accurate value for the frequency (In practice, helped<br/>to also look for 50th and 500th wave as an double check).</p><p>Ex. of this method to find frequency of a note in a .WAV file:</p><p>1.5601 secs = 1000 waves<br/>so frequency is 640.984552 Hz<br/>This was supposed to be 16/11 from 440 hz<br/>so should be 640<br/>- sharp by 2.66 cents</p><p>N.B. really pleased to discover this - could also use it to find frequency<br/>of bird song for really accurate transcriptions of pitches, I hope.</p><p>I also did a prog to make a batch file that copies 2 (or more if you like)<br/>files at random to the files<br/>0001.mid, 0002.mid,...0020.mid (up to whatever number you choose)</p><p>It just chooses one of the 2 files at random each time, so as you work<br/>through the copies, you have no idea how many more to expect of either type.</p><p>Did prelim results:</p><p>For 1/1 22/21 21/20<br/>was supposed to have diff of 3.93 cents<br/>Actually, because of soundcard resolution, diff was 3.74 cents<br/>Out of 20 copies of 1/1 22/21 21/20 and 1/1 21/20 22/21 in random order, got<br/>17 right, 2 not sure, 1 wrong.<br/>(not sure = put the file in both lists, after going through a second time to<br/>check. However in future, will make sure all the files go in one list only)</p><p>On binomial model, s.d. is sqrt(n/4), i.e. sqrt(5) = 2.236068<br/>so 17 is 3.130495 s.d.s away from the mean, so significant at the 99.74<br/>percent confidence level.</p><p>So I think I can prob. distinguish those.</p><p>For<br/>1/1 16/11 35/24 diff should be 4.503 cents, because of soundcard res., was<br/>4.78 cents<br/>got 8 correct, 12 wrong<br/>So doesn&apos;t look as if I can distinguish those at all, even though separation<br/>is wider (but I did this experiment 2nd, so could just be tiredness?? Or is<br/>it a real effect of more complex ratios<br/>??)</p><p>Also, a rather nice test is to play<br/>1/1 21/20 35/24 40/21 2/1<br/>and<br/>1/1 22/21 16/11 21/11 2/1<br/>- first is 7 limit, 2nd is 11 limit, and the ratios of 2nd are all within 5<br/>cents of ratios of 1st.</p><p>I tried those, and couldn&apos;t tell which<br/>was which. (9/20 right)</p><p>However those are just kind of dry runs, to test the method. I&apos;ll do it<br/>properly now. Want to know what&apos;s going on - it is rather intriguing.<br/>Especially, whether the interval from the 1/1 helps or not, and if so, in<br/>what context it does.</p><p>Anyway, need to do more tests. Also need to redo the tests using the basic<br/>synth, - seems to me that to be thorough one needs to rule out the poss.<br/>that the the timbre may change a bit with frequency. With the more realistic<br/>synth, so much going on when one looks at the wave file. I haven&apos;t noticed<br/>any such effect, but seems a poss. to consider, while the basic one has such<br/>a simple wave form that isn&apos;t likely to be affected at all in that way.</p><p>I&apos;ve done update of the xbridges prog.
