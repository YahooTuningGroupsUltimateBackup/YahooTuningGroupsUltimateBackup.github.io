And when, late last night, I came upon an even<br/>smaller superparticular ratio, it was no surprise to find<br/>that John had listed one also in &quot;The Number of 23-Prime<br/>Limit Superparticular Ratios Less than 10,000,000,&quot;<br/>Xenharmonikon_ 17 (Spring 1998), pp. 111-115 at 113. There<br/>it was, #227, a 17-limit ratio: 194481/194480, which Scala<br/>has informed me is 0.00890 cents.</p><p>By the way, here&apos;s a link to the complete text of John&apos;s<br/>XH17 article (tuning-math #2239):</p><p>&lt;<a href="http://robertinventor.com/tuning-math/s___3/msg_2225-2249.html">http://robertinventor.com/tuning-math/s___3/msg_2225-2249.html</a>&gt;</p><p>Those who wish to cut to the chase on the 194481/194480 may<br/>skip to Section 2.2 below, where a diagram shows how this<br/>&quot;supraminor scintillisma,&quot; as I call it, results from the<br/>difference of either 441/440 and 442/441, or of the xenisma<br/>at 2058/2057 and Ibn Sina&apos;s comma (which may have other<br/>names also) at 2080/2079. Comparing the supraminor thirds at<br/>63/52, 40/33, 17/14, and 147/121 will demonstrate all four<br/>commas, and thus also the scintillisma at 194481/194480.</p><p>Before getting into the scintillisma, John&apos;s #227, however,<br/>I&apos;d like to suggest an alternative way of arriving at the<br/>chalmersia, his #223, or 123201/123200, as the difference<br/>between the 9801/9800 kalisma or Gauss&apos;s comma and the<br/>10648/10647 harmonisma.</p><p>---------------------------------<br/>1. The Chalmersia (123201/123200)<br/>---------------------------------</p><p>One way to account for the Chalmersia which I&apos;ve read is as<br/>the difference of 351/350 and 352/351. Here&apos;s an alternative<br/>route to 123201/123200 where there may be some interesting<br/>connections with 351/350 that people can unravel, as well as<br/>a connection with 352/351 that I can immediately see.</p><p>We can arrive at the Chalmersia as the difference between<br/>Gauss&apos;s comma, also known as the kalisma, at 9801/9800<br/>(0.17665 cents); and the harmonisma at 10648/10647 (0.16260<br/>cents).</p><p>Gauss&apos;s comma or the kalisma at 9801/9800 may be defined as<br/>the difference between two undecimal kleismas at 896/891 or<br/>9.688 cents each, that is 19.376 cents; and a diaschisma in<br/>its more recent sense of 2048/2025 or 19.553 cents. The<br/>following demonstration may help:</p><p>   |       896/891       |        896/891          |<br/> 81/64---------------- 14/11 ----------------- 12544/9801<br/>407.820     9.688     417.508      9.688         427.196</p><p>                     2048/2025                      |<br/>   |--------------------------------------------- 32/25<br/> 81/64                19.553                     427.373<br/>407.820</p><p>In the first example, we begin with a just 81/64 major third<br/>from a chain of four 3/2 fifths. Adding one undecimal<br/>kleisma at 896/891 results in a 14/11 major third, the<br/>difference between 81/64 and 14/11 indeed one good<br/>definition of this kleisma. If we then increase 14/11 by<br/>another 896/891 kleisma, we arrive at 12544/9801 or 427.196<br/>cents.</p><p>In the second, we likewise begin at 81/64 and add a<br/>diaschisma at 2048/2025, an 81/80 syntonic comma (21.506<br/>cents) less a 3-5 schisma at 32805/32768 (1.954 cents), and<br/>arrive at 32/25 or 427.373 cents. This large major third is<br/>wider than 12544/9801 by the minute amount of the Gauss<br/>comma or kalisma at 9801/9800.

In such<br/>a scheme, pure 3/2 fifths typically alternative with others<br/>&quot;virtually tempered&quot; wide by either 352/351 or 4.925 cents<br/>(the difference between 32/27 and 13/11, or 81/64 and 33/26),<br/>or 364/363 or 4.763 cents (the difference between 13/11 and<br/>33/28, or 33/26 and 14/11). Together, the 352/351 and<br/>364/363 add up to the 896/891 undecimal kleisma we have<br/>already encountered above, the difference of 9.688 cents<br/>between 81/64 and 14/11:</p><p>                  (+352/351)                 (+364/363)<br/>        3/2         176/117         3/2        182/121<br/>  |-------------|-------------|-------------|------------|<br/>  C   701.955   G   706.880   D   701.955   A  706.718   E<br/> 1/1           3/2          44/39         22/13        14/11<br/>  0          701.955       208.835       910.790      417.508<br/>  |---------------------------|--------------------------|<br/>  C           44/39           D          273/242         E<br/>             208.835                     208.673</p><p>The 10648/10647 at 0.163 cents is equal to the tiny<br/>difference between 352/351 and 364/363. In the diagram, it<br/>is the difference between the _almost_ equal tones C-D and<br/>D-E at 44/39 (208.835 cents) and D-E (208.673 cents) making<br/>up the major third C-E at a just 14/11 (417.508 cents).</p><p>So a &quot;family tree&quot; for the chalmersia at 123201/123200<br/>might look like this. While the 351/350 (4.939 cents) or<br/>ratwolfisma has been defined as the difference between 20/13<br/>(745.786 cents) and 54/35 (750.725 cents), it is additionally<br/>equal to the difference between supraminor thirds at 63/52<br/>(332.208 cents) and 243/200 (337.148 cents), for example.</p><p> (54/35 - 20/13)<br/>    351/350<br/>     4.939<br/>------------------|<br/>                  |                 chalmersia<br/>                  |--------------- 123201/123200<br/>                  |                    0.014<br/>------------------|<br/> (32/27 - 13/11)<br/>    352/351<br/>     4.925</p><p>or</p><p>  (32/25 - 81/64)<br/>      19.553<br/>     2048/2025<br/>---------------------|   Gauss&apos;s comma<br/>                     |    or kalisma<br/>                     |------------------|<br/>                     |     9801/9800    | ---------------------|       0.177      |<br/>(12544/9801 - 81/64)                    |<br/>       19.376                           |<br/>   802816/793881                        |<br/>                                        |   chalmersia<br/>                                        |----------------<br/>  (32/27 - 13/11)                       | 123201/123200<br/>       4.925                            |      0.014<br/>      352/351                           | ---------------------|                  |<br/>                     |    harmonisma    |<br/>                     |------------------|<br/>                     |    10648/10647<br/>---------------------|       0.163<br/>  (13/11 - 33/28)<br/>       4.763<br/>      364/363</p><p>--------------------------------------<br/>2. The 194481/194480: a 17-limit ratio<br/>--------------------------------------</p><p>Like the 123201/123200 Chalmersia as 351/350 less 352/351,<br/>the 194481/194480 may be defined as the difference of two<br/>adjacent superparticular commas: 441/440 and 442/441. Both<br/>of these commas seem relevant to the MET-24 tuning,<br/>suggesting that 194481/194480 may also be relevant.</p><p>As with the Chalmersia with its alternative derivation from<br/>the kalisma (9801/9800) less than harmonisma (10648/10647),<br/>the 194481/194480 may be also be derived from the xenisma of<br/>2058/2057 less Ibn Sina&apos;s comma, as it might called to<br/>supplement rather than replace any existing names, at<br/>2080/2079. This pair of commas may also both be relevant to<br/>MET-24, again suggesting the relevance of 194481/194480 also.</p><p>--------------------------------<br/>2.1 The 441/440 and 442/441 pair<br/>--------------------------------</p><p>The 441/440 comma seems most relevant to MET-24, a parapyth<br/>temperament with a canonical form of (2/1, 703.771, 57.422),<br/>as the difference between 88/63 (578.582 cents) and a pure<br/>7/5 (582.512 cents), or 3.930 cents, with the actual<br/>tempered interval at 577.734 cents. Here I will use the<br/>strictly regular 2048-EDO version to simplify things a bit.</p><p>Another definition of the 441/440 ties in the structure of<br/>MET-24, where the tempered semitone is meant to represent<br/>22/21 (80.537 cents), with a canonical size of 81.445 cents,<br/>while a 4/3 fourth plus a 21/20 semitone (84.467 cents)<br/>would yield a pure 7/5. Thus 441/440 is equal to the<br/>difference of 22/21 and 21/20.</p><p>While MET-24 is designed to support primes 2-3-7-11-13,<br/>sonorities suggesting prime 5 may sometimes arise. For<br/>example, the following seventh sonority might well give a<br/>total impression of 4:5:6:7, with 5:4 and 7:5 alike at about<br/>441/440 wide or a bit more. Note that the major third is<br/>close to 441/352, or 21/16 less 22/21, while 21/16 less<br/>21/20 would yield a pure 5/4:</p><p>                  441/352<br/>    1/1             5/4          3/2           7/4<br/>     Eb ----------- F#* -------- Bb ----------- C*<br/>     0            390.829      703.711       968.555<br/>                     |--------------------------|<br/>                                88/63<br/>                                 7/5<br/>                               577.734</p><p>Here the small major third could be taken as either 5/4 or a<br/>near-just 441/352, and the diminished fifth as either 88/63<br/>(e.g.26/21 plus 44/39, or 370.312 cents plus 207.422 cents)<br/>or 7/5. This near-4:5:6:7 makes an interesting variant on a<br/>more usual 44:56:66:77 or &quot;rebounding seventh&quot; chord with a<br/>regular 14/11 major third (Eb-G-Bb-C#*), with the same<br/>standard resolution, for example</p><p>         C#*   C  D  Eb         C#*  C  D  Eb<br/>         Bb    C     Bb         Bb   C     Bb<br/>         F#*   A     Bb         G    A     Bb<br/>         Eb    F     Eb    or   Eb   F     Eb</p><p>Here the outer minor seventh contracts to the fifth of<br/>another unstable sonority with major third and fifth, the<br/>highest voice then moving to the major sixth so that all<br/>four voices may expand to a 2:3:4. The seventh is said to be<br/>&quot;rebounding&quot; because the ultimate resolution most often<br/>returns to the same note in the lowest voice on which this<br/>seventh sonority is built.</p><p>A purely melodic context where 441/440 is relevant is the<br/>tetrachord 10:9-8:7-21:20 or 1/1-8/7-80/63-4/3.</p><p>      0   182.404 413.578 498.045<br/>     1/1   10/9    80/63    4/3<br/>      G     G#*      B       C<br/>      0   183.398 414.844 496.289</p><p>While G-B represents 14/11 (417.508 cents) or 4/3 less<br/>22/21, it even more closely approximates 80/63 (413.578<br/>cents). These two major thirds differ by 441/440, showing<br/>that this comma, if I am using the phrase correctly, is &quot;in<br/>the kernel&quot; for MET-24.</p><p>This brings us now to the adjacent superparticular or<br/>epimoric comma of 442/441 (3.921 cents) -- the difference,<br/>notably between 63/52 (332.208 cents) and 17/14 (336.130<br/>cents). In MET-24, this supraminor or small neutral third is<br/>at 333.398 cents, and might represent either of these ratios<br/>as well as al-Farabi&apos;s 40/33 (333.041 cents), to which it is<br/>actually closest (more on this shortly).</p><p>Further, there may be a certain linkage between the 441/440<br/>and 442/441 because a supraminor third such as Eb-F# (333.4<br/>cents) plus the third generator of the tuning at 57.4 cents<br/>yields a small major third such as Eb-F#* (390.829 cents).</p><p>Thus both members of this comma pair, 441/440 and 442/441,<br/>are evidently relevant to MET-24. Now let us consider the<br/>alternative pair -- and a situation where this pair is<br/>involved as well!</p><p>------------------------------------<br/>2.2 The 2058/2057 and 2080/2079 pair<br/>------------------------------------</p><p>The 2058/2057 or xenisma (0.841 cents) may be defined, for<br/>example, as the difference between a 17/14 supraminor third<br/>and the supraminor third from 14/11 less 22/21, or 147/121<br/>(336.971 cents).</p><p>In MET-24, where the tempered values for 14/11 and 22/21 are<br/>414.844 cents and 81.445 cents, either 17/14 or 147/121 is<br/>represented as 333.398 cents. Interestingly, 414.844 cents<br/>can also reasonably represent either 33/26 (412.745 cents),<br/>especially given the near-just 13/11 (289.210 cents) at a<br/>tempered 288.867 cents; or, as we have seen 80/63 (413.578<br/>cents).</p><p>Taking these three possible JI ratios for the regular major<br/>third, and reducing each by 22/21, we have these related<br/>ratios and commas for the supraminor third, plus 17/14:</p><p>        Regular major third Eb-G (414.844 cents)</p><p>                     352:351 = 4.925<br/>     |------------------------------------------|<br/>  412.745        413.578                     417.508<br/>   33/26          80/63                       14/11<br/>     |--------------|---------------------------|<br/>        2080:2079              441:440<br/>          0.833                 3.930</p><p>  332.208        333.041           336.130   336.971<br/>   63/52          40/33             17/14    147/121<br/>     |--------------|-----------------|---------|<br/>        2080:2079         561:560      2058:2057<br/>          0.833            3.089         0.841<br/>     |--------------------------------|<br/>   63/52         442:441            17/14<br/>                  3.921<br/>                    |---------------------------|<br/>                  40/33        441:440       147/121<br/>                                3.930</p><p>        Supraminor third Eb-F# (333.398 cents)</p><p>Comparing the sizes of the four just supraminor thirds at<br/>63/52, 40/33, 17/14, and 147/121 accounts for the commas of<br/>both relevant pairs for our 194481/194480. For the first<br/>adjacent superparticular pair, we have 441/440 (40/33,<br/>147/121) and 442/441 (63/52, 17/14).

Quoting a genus<br/>of al-Farabi at 1/1-9/8-99/80-4/3 or 9:8-11:10-320:297<br/>(396:352:320:297), where &quot;the interval of a tone is followed<br/>by an interval of 11:10,&quot; he notes that &quot;[t]he ratio of the<br/>complementary interval will be 320:297, very close to<br/>14:13.&quot; (Translation based on French version of Baron<br/>Rodolphe d&apos;Erlanger.)</p><p>The difference between 14:13 (128.298 cents) and the<br/>slightly larger 320:297 (129.131 cents) is 2080/2079 (0.833<br/>cents). Another way to define this comma is as the amount<br/>that 11:10 plus 14:13, or 77/65 (293.302 cents) falls short<br/>of 32:27 (294.135 cents). It is also the amount by which a<br/>tetrachord with the three superparticular steps of 9:8,<br/>11:10, and 14:13, adding up to 693/520 (497.212 cents) will<br/>fall short of a just 4/3 fourth.</p><p>It is fascinating that one of the oldest 13-limit commas<br/>alluded to in the literal, around a millennium ago, the<br/>2080/2079, should have a connection with one of the newest<br/>17-limit commas, perhaps first mentioned by John Chalmers,<br/>and listed as his #227 in _Xenharmonikon_ 17, which I now<br/>propose to call the supraminor scintillisma at 194481/194480 (with &quot;supraminor&quot; an optional adjective noting its<br/>relevance to supraminor thirds).</p><p>Here, in conclusion, is a family tree based on the above<br/>diagram of supraminor third sizes:</p><p> (147/121 - 40/33)<br/>       3.930<br/>      441/440<br/>--------------------|<br/>                    |    scintillisma<br/>                    |---------------------<br/>                    |    194481/194480<br/>--------------------|        0.009<br/>  (17/14 - 63/52)<br/>       3.921<br/>      442/441</p><p>or</p><p> (147/121 - 17/14)<br/>        0.841<br/>      2058/2057<br/>----------------------|<br/>       xenisma        |    scintillisma<br/>                      |--------------------<br/>                      |   194481/194480<br/>  Ibn Sina&apos;s comma    |       0.009<br/>----------------------|<br/>  (40/33 - 63/52)<br/>        0.833<br/>      2080/2079</p><p>Peace and love,</p><p>Margo Schulter<br/>mschulter@...<br/>23 December 2012</p></div><h3><a id=105621 href="#105621">ðŸ”—</a>genewardsmith &#x3C;genewardsmith@...&#x3E;</h3><span>12/23/2012 4:23:30 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, Margo Schulter &lt;mschulter@...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; When it comes to small commas like the 13-limit chalmersisma<br/>&gt; or chalmersia at 123201/123200 (0.01405 cents)</p><p>Is &quot;chalmersia&quot; a more correct name?</p></div><h3><a id=105623 href="#105623">ðŸ”—</a>genewardsmith &#x3C;genewardsmith@...&#x3E;</h3><span>12/23/2012 6:23:31 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, Margo Schulter &lt;mschulter@...&gt; wrote:</p><p>&gt; Before getting into the scintillisma, John&apos;s #227, however,<br/>&gt; I&apos;d like to suggest an alternative way of arriving at the<br/>&gt; chalmersia, his #223, or 123201/123200, as the difference<br/>&gt; between the 9801/9800 kalisma or Gauss&apos;s comma and the<br/>&gt; 10648/10647 harmonisma.</p><p>Another way of looking at it is that like 100/99, 225/224, 441/440, 3025/3024, 14400/14399 and 23409/23408, it has a numerator which is the square of a triangular number.
