Whats it got to do<br/>&gt; with the list? Consult the Monzo shrine?</p><p>C&apos;mon, it was one tiny post and I gave both off-topic and<br/>plug alert warnings at the beginning for those who wanted<br/>to skip it.</p><p>Its relevancy to the Tuning List is simply that lots of subscribers<br/>here like to follow my work, even the stuff that does not relate<br/>specifically to tuning, so it was a good place to announce an<br/>update.  And anyone who does follow the development of my Webern<br/>page will see that it&apos;ll eventually have a tuning analysis.</p><p>-monz</p><p>Joseph L.
