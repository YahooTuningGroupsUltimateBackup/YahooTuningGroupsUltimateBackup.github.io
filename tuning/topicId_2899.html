Just one quote, such as this from John ffitch:</p><p>&gt;May I add my voice against all these gimicks?  Animation on Web pages<br/>&gt;are distracting and usually pointless.  Because of the use of trap<br/>&gt;pages and the like I usually run with Java an Javascript switched off<br/>&gt;anyway.  How about using teh web for giving information rather than<br/>&gt;exercises in flashy visuals which add nothing?</p><p>Since John brought it up here, I&apos;ll add my two cents: good web programming<br/>is a matter of craft, skill and dedication -- to paint coding techniques<br/>with this broad a brush is a tad egregious. While not a full-time HTML<br/>jockey, I&apos;ve spent many hours making sure that anything I add to Corporeal<br/>Meadows *above and beyond* textual information does *not* impede the user,<br/>or exclude any but the most primitive platforms and applications. The<br/>majority of the site will still work on 2.0 browsers with 14.4 connections,<br/>and I have many &apos;users&apos; in the UK.</p><p>Beyond that, the ability for me to not only write *about* a Boo part but to<br/>be able to *show* a page from the part and have a decent sounding example<br/>*play* while you look at the part is a real bonus. I wouldn&apos;t say this if I<br/>didn&apos;t receive positive feedback from many users, including non-U.S.<br/>accesses, where bandwidth can be precious indeed. One indicator is how long<br/>many actually stay on-site.</p><p>My point is simply this: a well-crafted site can be useful to virtually<br/>every visitor, be they using a cable modem on a Silicon Graphics box to a<br/>486 with 256 colors coming in from some public library. The only difference<br/>is the amount of work the builders of the site are willing to put in, and<br/>with browser wars and many platforms, it&apos;s not easy. Your choices for<br/>content delivery must match what your audience can access, or your audience<br/>will certainly go elsewhere.</p><p>Mr. Varese:<br/>~~~~~~~~~~~<br/>I still find my favorite reference to V.&apos;s _life_ the bio done by his wife,<br/>Louise (&quot;Varese: A Looking-Glass Diary&quot;), if for no other reason to see a<br/>reprint of the editorial cartoon depicting New York after the premiere of<br/>&quot;Hyperprism&quot;, complete with buildings crumbling, cars crashing, general<br/>mayhem. Lovely.</p><p>There have been a couple of different &apos;complete&apos; recordings recently; the<br/>Chailly set has been talked about a bit, and I thought I saw that Kent<br/>Nagano had done some? Anyway, the stuff is out there. BTW, is it known<br/>around here that N. Slonimsky conducted the premiere of &quot;Ionization&quot; in<br/>1933? What a guy.</p><p>For those of you following the Zappa thread, be sure to see a great article<br/>(monz will appreciate the references to La Mesa) entitled &quot;Edgard Varese,<br/>The Idol of My Youth&quot; by FZ, originally in Stereo Review and kept online at:</p><p><a href="http://picasso.cslab.wesleyan.edu/~jfei/varese/zappa-sr.html">http://picasso.cslab.wesleyan.edu/~jfei/varese/zappa-sr.html</a></p><p>The main site, which is simply:</p><p><a href="http://picasso.cslab.wesleyan.edu/~jfei/varese/">http://picasso.cslab.wesleyan.edu/~jfei/varese/</a></p><p>has some interesting things. Their link to the American Music Resource<br/>(dated, but lot&apos;s online) is old; see AMR at:</p><p><a href="http://www.uncg.edu/~flmccart/amrhome.html">http://www.uncg.edu/~flmccart/amrhome.html</a></p><p>EV is one of those composers that I dearly wished had written more music,<br/>but I&apos;m happy to have what is there.</p><p>Cheers,<br/>Jon<br/>..... . . . . . . . .  .  .  .  .  .  .  . . . . . . . . .....<br/>Jonathan M.
