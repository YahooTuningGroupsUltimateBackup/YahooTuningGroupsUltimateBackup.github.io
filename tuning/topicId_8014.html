Might that have any<br/>&gt;&gt;relation to this discussion. (If that is a naive notion, just say so and<br/>&gt;&gt;I&apos;ll forget it.)</p><p>Paul Erlich&apos;s reply:</p><p>&gt; I did respond to that -- it was the first time I suggested 1/24:1/19:1/16.<br/>&gt; The common overtone of these notes is the dominant, four octaves higher. As<br/>&gt; for undertones, the &quot;undertone series&quot; does not occur in nature as a<br/>&gt; simultaneous event, the way the overtone series does.</p><p>What about combinational tones? Helmholtz explains on page 216 of the Ellis<br/>translation that the minor triad C - Eb - G (10:12:15 in JI terms) produces<br/>a low Ab as the lowest of the combinational tones and therefore cannot be as<br/>consonant as the major triad C - E - G (4:5:6) which produces a low C. In<br/>the major triad which Paul suggests, the minor third  is a 19:16. If we<br/>consider this to be C- Eb than the combinational tone will be a low G, which<br/>is more acceptable as the Ab from Helholtz&apos;s point of view. I&apos;m a poor<br/>singer but I can simulate a kind of  locking-in effect by tuning a string on<br/>my guitar against a drone in order to get only one single note right. Tuning<br/>Eb over a C-G drone ended up in a pitch slightly lower as the tempered Eb,<br/>which may perfectly correspond to the 19:16 (297,51 cents).</p><p>Xavier Charles offered me generously his preparation to a thesis<br/>&quot;Contribution &#xFFFD; l&apos;&#xFFFD;tude des probl&#xFFFD;mes de la gamme et de la justesse dans la<br/>musique occidentale, vers une autre th&#xFFFD;orie des hauteurs?&quot; ( Contribution<br/>the the study of the problems  of the scale and &apos;being in tune&apos; in Western<br/>music, toward another pitch theory?) In this paper he abondantly describes<br/>the minor third 19:16 and gives a profound analysis of Mozart&apos;s Ave verum<br/>corpus, KV618, using the 19:16 minor third. On 11 November 1999 he wrote to<br/>us:</p><p>&gt; I think that singers do 16-19-24 for a really minor chord if the three<br/>&gt; notes sound together. If the tonic isn&apos;t here, for separate work for<br/>&gt; example, 24/19 would be too near of 5/4 and singers would have very<br/>&gt; difficult to do 24/19. But I have no experience of that, it&apos;s only that<br/>&gt; I suppose.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; But with my violin I have long years of practice. When I play a minor<br/>&gt; third, I always make a choice between 6/5, 19/16 and 7/6 with the help<br/>&gt; of difference tone (for diatonic music, chromatism is another problem).<br/>&gt; With bB/G, I hear bE for 6/5, D for 19/16, C for 7/6. For 6/5 and 7/6<br/>&gt; it&apos;s quite easy, for 19/16, if the third is enough high, it&apos;s possible,<br/>&gt; if not, I play a &quot;little&quot; 6/5 which &quot;seams&quot; minor...</p><p>Xavier used the term difference tone for Ellis&apos; combinational tone. IMO it<br/>might be very usefull to investigate the phenomenon &apos;combinational tones&apos; to<br/>determine which is the interval that *locks* the best.</p><p>--Wim</p></div><h3><a id=8080 href="#8080">ðŸ”—</a>Paul H.
