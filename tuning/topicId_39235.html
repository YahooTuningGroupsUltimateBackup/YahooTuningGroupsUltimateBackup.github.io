If you had problems with the previous version then please try this one!</p><p>The new version has the same microtonal tuning features as the previous version plus a feature to defer dynamic re-tuning to the start of new notes.  There is now greater support for midi controllers including pitch bend over a variable range, modulation wheel, reverb, echo, channel volume, balance and sustain.  Other new features include a voice mixer and an accordion interface for one click chords including strummed and arpeggiated chords.  Those of you who work in non 12 note scale structures can define your own accordions!</p><p>The new version also addresses a problem which occurred with the data files in continental European locales due to a different decimal separator ( , / . ), and other minor bugs.
