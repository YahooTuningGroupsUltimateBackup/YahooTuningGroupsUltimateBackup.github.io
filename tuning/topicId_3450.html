Fellow Americans Mike Ellis<br/>(microtonal Jazz style - almost never plays 12TET) and Daniel Goode<br/>(composer/clarinetist formerly teaching at Rutgers), and I took top honors in<br/>the reviews.  Sorry, folks they&apos;re in Russian.</p><p>My program included &quot;Varese Variation&quot; for Theremin and Electric Bassoon<br/>which I arranged from Varese material used previously on AFMM concerts<br/>(Graphs and Time), joined by master thereminist Lydia Kavina.  For a<br/>bassoonist (even electric) it was a rollercoaster of playing.  And the<br/>heat...had trouble opening eyes due to the heat.</p><p>Other pieces presented (along with radio interviews and television cameos)<br/>included Joseph Pehrson&apos;s eighthtone &quot;One Small Step for Man,&quot; Giacinto<br/>Scelsi&apos;s &quot;Maknongan,&quot; John Cage&apos;s &quot;0&quot;0&apos;,&quot; as well as my own compositions<br/>(&quot;Dune,&quot; &quot;Zanzibar,&quot; and &quot;Eye of Newt&quot;).  Additionally, I was implored to<br/>improvise.</p><p>A recital 2 days later in Kazan, capital of the Republic of Tartarstan, asked<br/>for 2 imporvisations after the concert.  Perhaps the freedom with which<br/>Americans transverse the sonic spectrum is an especially delicious concept to<br/>people that were not permitted to invite anyone to play during the Soviet<br/>times.</p><p>Kazan is amazing...actually older than Moscow.  2 Television interviews (the<br/>first harsh in its questions...&quot;Why did you come...why not keep only 7<br/>notes...Have you heard Tartar music yet and what do you think?.&quot;  The second<br/>interview came just as the rectial finished and they were imbued with the<br/>enthusiasm of the audience, pronouncing polymicrtonal music as the near<br/>future of music!</p><p>There were bassoon master classes to both cities&apos; conservatories, a<br/>presentation for the Composer Music Union in Moscow where I played recorded<br/>music and showed scores (Raven, Dune, Cosmic Rays).  On the final evening<br/>(June 4th) I played at an east village-style club called &quot;Oggis&quot; for an<br/>hour-long improvised presentation between myself, a French poet, a popular<br/>local dancer, and saxophonist Ellis.  Lots of corporealism here.</p><p>Great composers that regularly use microtones are Yuri Kasparov (who I&apos;ve<br/>commissioned for a new polymicrotonal bassoon solo) and Victor Eikomovsky<br/>(who we will perform next year).  Composer Anton Rovner (the same as from the<br/>May 27th Micromay concert) was the gracious and caring guide that took me on<br/>this unimagineable journey.  As exciting as Micromay was, it was quickly<br/>forgotten in the midst of the Russian excitement.  People were kind and fair<br/>and I look forward to a return visit.</p><p>Johnny Reinhard<br/>AFMM<br/><a href="mailto:afmmjr@aol.com">afmmjr@aol.com</a></p></div>
