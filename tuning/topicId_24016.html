The<br/>central thrust should instead be in achieving more intonational accuracy and<br/>flexibility.  To obtain this accuracy and flexibility, there will probably be<br/>some common skills, but notation need not be among them, and indeed, if the<br/>history of intonational experiment is a good guide, composers will inevitably<br/>find their own notational solutions. The question is then: will performers be<br/>prepared to respond musically and intellectually to those solutions?</p><p>In the discussion that concluded a recent festival in Berlin, I made the claim<br/>that musical training has been vague, if not speechless, when it comes to<br/>tuning. Most teachers of vocalists and instrumentalists are limited in their<br/>description of intonation to terms like: &quot;off&quot;; &quot;flat&quot;; &quot;sharp&quot;; &quot;expressive&quot;.<br/>In light of this speechlessness, I proposed that it would be useful if musical<br/>training would include: (1) for voices and instruments with harmonic timbres,<br/>learning to tune beatless intervals, intervals with fixed beating rates, and<br/>intervals with audible difference tones; (2) learning to estimate interval sizes<br/>in cents (and for western musicians, in terms of fractions of tones); and (3)<br/>learning to play in at least two historical tuning systems other than 12tet; for<br/>western musicians, I would suggest Pythagorean and meantone.  I believe that<br/>when these skills are internalized, the student musician will be prepared to at<br/>least approach any new or historical intonational system with a degree of<br/>confidence.</p><p>Daniel Wolf<br/>Budapest</p></div>
