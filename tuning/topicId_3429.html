The two differ widely in their coverage of microtonal<br/>&gt; music; while the former contains none (if I recall correctly),<br/>&gt; the latter goes into enough depth that even Blackwood gets a<br/>&gt; paragraph.</p><p>I&apos;m not familiar with Morgan&apos;s book (citation please?), but<br/>I have Griffiths, 1981, _Modern Music: the avant-garde since 1945_.</p><p>He does indeed discuss microtonality a bit, altho not in enough<br/>detail to offer any real intonational insight, but I still find<br/>it very interesting, because these are composers who are not<br/>often discussed in microtonal forums (fora?).</p><p>In fact, I had intended a few weeks ago, during the &apos;serialism&apos;<br/>discussion, to bring up his mention of Pousseur&apos;s and Boulez&apos;s<br/>microtonal pieces, but I was busy working on my _Spider_ piece.<br/>So at least my re-reading of Griffiths is still fresh in my mind.</p><p>Here are a few selections:</p><p>[Griffiths, p 171]<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; The experimental tradition (not so much a contradiction in terms<br/>&gt; as perhaps it should be) goes back to the music produced by Cage<br/>&gt; and his associates in the early 1950s, and perhaps still further<br/>&gt; to the work of other American composers who were unencumbered by<br/>&gt; European notions of what a musical composition should be: Cowell,<br/>&gt; Partch and Ives.</p><p>[Griffiths, p 176]<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; [La Monte Young&apos;s] scrupulous selection of frequency structures<br/>&gt; with reference to their supposed moods, for example, bears<br/>&gt; comparison with an Indian musician&apos;s attitude to the raga.<br/>&gt; However, his insistence on just intonation suggests a link with<br/>&gt; Partch, and his readiness to confine himself to a narrow range of<br/>&gt; possibilities makes him a central figure among contemporary<br/>&gt; American and English minimalists, many of whom have been<br/>&gt; influenced by him.</p><p>That&apos;s all Griffiths has to say about Partch.  I know Paul Erlich<br/>is a Partch fan, so perhaps that&apos;s why he didn&apos;t recall Griffiths&apos;s<br/>other references to microtonal compositions.  Here they are:</p><p>[Griffiths, p 46]<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Exactly what the future might hold was suggested by Boulez in<br/>&gt; his notorious obituary &apos;Schoenberg is Dead&apos;, in which, after<br/>&gt; again roundly condemning the late master&apos;s defunct forms and<br/>&gt; other evidence of backsliding, he went on to propose that:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; [Boulez]<br/>&gt;&gt; Perhaps we could enlarge the field of 12-tone composition to<br/>&gt;&gt; include other intervals than the semitone: micro-intervals,<br/>&gt;&gt; irregular intervals, complex sounds.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; This was an area in which exploration had already begun.  The<br/>&gt; mention of &apos;complex sounds&apos; is a reference to the concept of<br/>&gt; &apos;aggregates&apos; developed by Cage (tho not, of course, used by him<br/>&gt; in a serial manner), while Boulez himself had applied serial<br/>&gt; procedures to quarter-tones in _Le visage nuptial_ and had<br/>&gt; communicated his interest to Henri Pousseur, who reacted to<br/>&gt; his influence first with the Webernian _Trois chants sacres_<br/>&gt; for soprano and string trio (1951) and then with _Prospections_<br/>&gt; for 3 pianos tuned at sixth-tone distances (1952).  But the most<br/>&gt; pervasively influential thought was that which came next in<br/>&gt; Boulez&apos;s article: [total serialism].</p><p>[Griffiths, p 198]<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; And the third _Improvisation sur Mallarme_ [by Boulez] clearly<br/>&gt; shows both aspects of his borrowing for the East: the material<br/>&gt; in its long sustained sounds, its heterophonies for homogenous<br/>&gt; percussive groupings (2 xylophones, 3 harps, etc.) and its<br/>&gt; immense opening soprano melisma delicately inflected with<br/>&gt; quarter-tones; the formal in its provision of alternatives<br/>&gt; and its loosening of temporal coordination among overlapping<br/>&gt; blocks.</p><p>[Griffiths, p 215]<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; In addressing himself to his other great 20th-century predecessor<br/>&gt; [Schoenberg was the first one], Stravinsky, Pousseur has remarked<br/>&gt; that before that composer&apos;s harmony can be adequately described<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; [Pousseur]<br/>&gt;&gt; we will have to wait for the search for (if not the discovery of)<br/>&gt;&gt; a much more general harmonic system which will allow us to<br/>&gt;&gt; integrate the chromatic harmony of the Viennese as well as the<br/>&gt;&gt; more consonant harmonies of our history, including all the<br/>&gt;&gt; attempts of preserial music, and to open the way to envisioning<br/>&gt;&gt; the integration of extra-European harmonies, as well as the<br/>&gt;&gt; opening up (now partially reclosing) of possibilities which are<br/>&gt;&gt; new by virtue of their very material (non-tempered scales,<br/>&gt;&gt; relationships of &quot;harmonic&quot; containing primary factors greater<br/>&gt;&gt; than 5; micro-intervals: all things whose exploration *does* to<br/>&gt;&gt; my knowledge absolutely require the aid of *simple consonances*,<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; this grand design of harmonic integration being sparked off by a<br/>&gt; consideration of _Agon_.  Pousseur&apos;s _Racine 19_ for cello (1977)<br/>&gt; marks a step in the exploration of the new possibilities of which<br/>&gt; he writes, using as it does an equal-tempered scale of 19<br/>&gt; intervals to the octave; but his richest and most consistent<br/>&gt; attempts at general harmonic integration have come in _Die<br/>&gt; Erprobung [des Petrus Hebraicus (1974)]_ and in two homages to<br/>&gt; Stravinsky: _L&apos;effacement du Prince Igor_ for orchestra and<br/>&gt; _Stravinsky au futur_ for voice, solo instrument, ensemble and<br/>&gt; electronics (both 1971). [Griffiths goes on to discuss these two<br/>&gt; works in some detail; apparently they are not microtonal]</p><p>[Griffiths, p 168]<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Another work by [Charles] Dodge, his _Extensions_ for trumpet and<br/>&gt; tape (1973), cleverly joins the live and recorded forces by using<br/>&gt; the same principle, that of equally dividing the pitch space, in<br/>&gt; both.  Thus the free-flowing trumpet line emphasizes tritones,<br/>&gt; 3rds and 2nds, these being equal divisions of the octave, while<br/>&gt; the computer-generated tape scans across in wide glissandos,<br/>&gt; gradually accumulating further equal divisions of its own<br/>&gt; pitch space so that the original 16 regularly spaced tones have<br/>&gt; become 1024 by the end.</p><p>(Dodge, a very inventive composer with a great sense of humor<br/> in his pieces, was one of my teachers, in fact, the only one<br/> who was supportive of my explorations in microtonality.)</p><p>[Griffiths, p 78-79]<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; The following spring [1953] he [Stockhausen] returned to Cologne,<br/>&gt; where Herbert Eimert and Robert Beyer had begun experiments in<br/>&gt; electronic music at the radio station.  There he found the<br/>&gt; equipment which enabled him to create the first sine-tone<br/>&gt; composition, his _Studie I_ (1953), in which each sound is<br/>&gt; constructed from up to six pure frequencies taken from a table<br/>&gt; based on the proportions 48 : 20 : 25 : 15 5/8 : 37 1/2 : 30,<br/>&gt; that sequence being derived from the frequency ratios in the<br/>&gt; interval succession of falling minor 10th (12:5), rising major<br/>&gt; 3rd (4:5), falling minor 6th (8:5), rising minor 10th (5:12),<br/>&gt; falling major 3rd (5:4).  For example, the first sound of the<br/>&gt; piece contains the frequencies 1920 Hz, 800 Hz, 1000 Hz and<br/>&gt; 625 Hz, which, it will be observed, express the relations among<br/>&gt; the first four members of the proportion sequence.  And the<br/>&gt; same sequence governs the rhythmic construction, so that, for<br/>&gt; example, the first sound occupies 1920 mm of tape (at a speed<br/>&gt; of 762 mm per second), the second 800 mm.  Other six-unit series,<br/>&gt; made up of the whole numbers from one to six, determine the<br/>&gt; number of sine tones packaged into each sound, the intensities<br/>&gt; of the components, the dynamic curve applied to the sound and<br/>&gt; the durations of pauses.  nothing could better illustrate<br/>&gt; Stockhausen&apos;s will to achieve a perfect image of unity.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; However, the sine tones obstinately failed to get into the<br/>&gt; hoped-for new timbres, and so in his next electronic composition,<br/>&gt; _Studie II_ (1954), he tried a different technique.  The piece<br/>&gt; is again based on an artificial frequency gamut, this time a<br/>&gt; simpler one of 81 frequencies each related to the next by the<br/>&gt; ratio 1:5^(1/25) [i.e., &apos;25th root of 5&apos;, the notation of which<br/>&gt; I can&apos;t reproduce in ASCII] (approximately 1:1.07); this is an<br/>&gt; octave-less scale with a constant interval between adjacent<br/>&gt; frequencies of slightly more than a semitone [more accurately,<br/>&gt; the ratio is ~1:1.0665 = ~111.453 cents, Griffiths&apos;s inaccuracy<br/>&gt; probably reflecting his general non-interest in microtonality].<br/>&gt; From the scale Stockhausen draws 193 &apos;note mixtures&apos;, each<br/>&gt; containing five sine tones, and these constitute the work&apos;s<br/>&gt; repertory of sounds.  But instead of simply superposing the sine<br/>&gt; tones, as he had in _Studie I_, Stockhausen spliced together each<br/>&gt; group of five, played the recording in resonant space, and then<br/>&gt; recorded the reverberation of the mixture.  This brought more<br/>&gt; fusion than had the earlier procedure, but again the work&apos;s<br/>&gt; success in generating unified timbres is modest.</p><p>Joseph L.
