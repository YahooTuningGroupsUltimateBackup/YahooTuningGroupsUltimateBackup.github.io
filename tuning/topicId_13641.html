I don&apos;t think it&apos;s &quot;accustomization&quot; either.</p><p>I heard one theory that since the inner ear is arranged as a spiral,<br/>the hairs at 2x frequency are adjacent ACROSS the spiral (rather than<br/>side to side).

It&apos;s sometimes proposed<br/>as a multidimesional scaling of pitch (&quot;invariants in sound&quot; - Johns, Hahn)<br/>and sometimes speculatively as an actual physical reality.  In the latter<br/>case, though, I think we&apos;re talking about the arrangements of neurons, not<br/>of the cochlea.  In actuality, I don&apos;t think anyone has the slightest clue<br/>about the arrangements of individual neurons, and I don&apos;t find the spiral<br/>to be a particularly useful mathematical abstraction.</p><p>jason</p></div>
