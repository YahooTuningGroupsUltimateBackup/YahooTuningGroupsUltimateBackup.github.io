It&apos;s that you come out with a good average approximation<br/>&gt;for the intervals that really matter, and let the wolves howl away on the<br/>&gt;other intervals. Somewhere in the Baroque, people started using wolves for<br/>&gt;fun (Bach, Farewell suite to his brother going on a trip, very youthful<br/>&gt;work), but that was a gimmick, pretty much a sign that meantone had worn<br/>&gt;out its welcome.</p><p>&gt;What do you mean by calling these mathematically derived equal emperaments<br/>&gt;&apos;mean tone tunings&apos;? Is it really just the size of the seconds?</p><p>It&apos;s the size of all the intervals, since they are all generated by the fifth<br/>and the 19-tET fifth and 31-tET fifth are meantone fifths (~695 and ~697 cents,<br/>respectively).</p><p>Judith, 19-tET and 31-tET come out with a good average approximation<br/>for the intervals that really matter, and if you only use 12 keys on your<br/>keyboard, the wolves will howl. However, if you extend your keyboard to<br/>19 notes (as Salinas did in the 16th century) or 31 notes (many examples)<br/>you will have tamed all of the wolves, as in 12-tET, but without sacrificing<br/>the good appoximations for the intervals that really matter.</p><p>By the way, the &quot;intervals that really matter&quot; are the 5-limit consonances,<br/>and 31-tET also gives you good approximations to 7-limit intervals, which<br/>is why many have heralded 31-tET as a tuning for the past and for the<br/>future.</p></div><h3><a id=4555 href="#4555">ðŸ”—</a>Judith Conrad &#x3C;jconrad@xxxxxxx.xxxx.xxxx&#x3E;</h3><span>8/29/1999 10:33:27 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>On 29 Aug 1999 <a href="mailto:perlich@acadian-asset.com">perlich@acadian-asset.com</a> wrote:</p><p>&gt; Judith, 19-tET and 31-tET come out with a good average approximation<br/>&gt; for the intervals that really matter, and if you only use 12 keys on your<br/>&gt; keyboard, the wolves will howl.

I<br/>don&apos;t why it&apos;s upsetting you, but if you tuned these keyboards to 17 out of<br/>31-tone equal temperament, these intervals would still sound pure, as<br/>31-tone equal temperament and 1/4-comma meantone tuning are aurally<br/>indistinguishable. 1/4-comma meantone is constructed from a chain of<br/>696.6-cent fifths, while 31-tone equal temperament is constructed from a<br/>chain of 696.8-cent fifths. Therefore the major thirds differ by 0.8 cents,<br/>which is negligible by 16th century standards.</p><p>&gt;Describe this 19-note keyboard of the 16th<br/>&gt;century to me.</p><p>If you tuned a 17-tone keyboard to 1/3-comma meantone temperament, and then<br/>tried to add a key between E and F, you would find that if you tuned it as<br/>E#, a just minor third below G#, it would be within one cent of Fb, a just<br/>minor third above Db. Likewise, a key between B and C could serve as both B#<br/>and Cb. You now kave a complete circle of 19 notes, and can play in 19 keys<br/>with all keys sounding virtually the same. For all intents and purposes,<br/>this is 19-tone equal temperament. Costeley and other early composers<br/>actually wrote music in this system. Salinas himself never mentioned this<br/>property himself, but since he did have a 19-tone keyboard, and was the<br/>first to describe 1/3-comma meantone temperament, it would seem likely that<br/>he hit upon the idea of a closed 19-tone system.</p><p>&gt;&gt; or 31 notes (many examples)</p><p>&gt;I hate to sound belligerent, but, um, historically speaking, name one?</p><p>Besides the examples Daniel Wolf just posted, others have been mentioned on<br/>this list, some with links to photographs. Important modern examples include<br/>the Fokker organ, which has been used to perform the music of Sweelinck and<br/>other Renaissance composers in an authentic tuning, and on which all key<br/>signatures are fingered identically. I believe there were more mentioned on<br/>the web page on organs with subsemitones, but that link has mysteriously<br/>disappeared from John Starrett&apos;s page.</p></div><h3><a id=4601 href="#4601">ðŸ”—</a>Judith Conrad &#x3C;jconrad@xxxxxxx.xxxx.xxxx&#x3E;</h3><span>8/31/1999 1:09:49 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Thanks everybody for explaining the 19 and 31 tone &apos;mean-tone&apos; equal<br/>temperaments.
