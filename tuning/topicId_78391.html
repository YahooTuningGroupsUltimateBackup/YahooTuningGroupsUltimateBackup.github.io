Here this tuning is given as<br/>realized in 1024-EDO, a standard for some synthesizers, where the<br/>average size of the 23 fifths is about 704.603 cents.</p><p>For purposes of symmetry and good fit, I have placed Rast at G# on the<br/>lower keyboard, although in practice this might not be the most<br/>convenient location using the two 12-note keyboards assumed here. On a<br/>Bosanquet or similar generalized keyboard, I suspect that it might be<br/>an ideal arrangement for many purposes.</p><p>This table shows the distance from Rast of each note or perde in<br/>cents, and also as an approximate JI ratio. Additionally, the closest<br/>equivalents or approximations in the 79-MOS are shown by specifying<br/>the number of 79-MOS steps, or yarmans, and sizes in cents.</p><p>A 79-MOS step or yarman is generally equal to about 2/3 of a Holdrian<br/>comma (1/53 octave, 22.6415 cents), or 15.0943 cents, or two steps of<br/>159-EDO -- with very slight variations to permit just tunings of steps<br/>at 4/3 (perde chargah) and 3/2 (perde neva), for example. In order to<br/>achieve a just fifth and octave, the 46th of the 79 steps is enlarged<br/>to a full Holdrian comma, or something varying only minutely from it.<br/>This single enlarged step has 3/2 or neva as its upper note or perde.</p><p>Incidentally, the Turkish term _perde_ or &quot;note, pitch&quot; (plural<br/>perdeler) might possibly be related, I might guess, to the Persian<br/>_pardeh_, which can have a similar meaning and more specifically<br/>signify the &quot;fret&quot; of an instrument.</p><p>In naming the perdeler, I have tried to be guided both by Arab and<br/>Turkish practice, and specifically by some of your conventions as they<br/>might apply to a system with fewer alternatives than the 79-MOS. When<br/>in doubt, I have taken the forms of Maqam Rast (as realized in this<br/>temperament) as normative: that is, in placing segah and evc or evdj<br/>(Arab awj) at 363 and 1068 cents, and hisar at 859 cents for the sixth<br/>degree of Ajemli or Nirz Rast.</p><p>An interesting feature is that perde buselik is at an almost just<br/>14/11, or about 18.5 Holdrian commas, sometimes suggested as

287.109<br/>______________________________________________________________________<br/>----------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p>A pleasant feature of this tuning is the subtle distinction of about<br/>21-22 cents, or not quite a Holdrian comma, between small and large<br/>neutral seconds at around 132/154 cents -- and likewise other neutral<br/>categories at 341/363, 837/859, and 1046/1068 cents. At certain<br/>locations, one can thus distinguish from the same final or tonic<br/>different shadings typical of certain maqamat.</p><p>For example, taking C# as our final, we can play either an Arab<br/>Bayyati where the smaller neutral second is preferred above the final<br/>but a wider neutral sixth is favored as an alternative inflection to<br/>the usual minor sixth; or a Turkish Huseyni where the larger neutral<br/>second might be placed before the smaller in the lower tetrachord:</p><p>Maqam Bayyati (Arab interpretation)</p><p>                                859<br/>                                 Bb<br/>  C#    D*    E    F#    G#    A     B     C#<br/>  0    132   286   496   704  782   990   1200<br/>    132   154   210   208   77   208   210</p><p>Maqam Huseyni</p><p>  C#     Eb   E    F#    G#    Bb    B      C#<br/>  0     154  286   496   704   859  990    1200</p><p>Such a modulation is rather subtle, if both forms are used in a single<br/>piece, since both maqamat might be regarded to belong to the same<br/>_fasila_ or &quot;family&quot; in an Arab view, sharing a lower tetrachord with<br/>two middle or neutral seconds plus an upper tone to complete the<br/>fourth. Of course, the most important difference is in the seyir or<br/>typical melodic development for each, with Huseyni emphasizing the<br/>fifth degree (perde huseyni when the final is on perde dugah, its<br/>regular location), and Arab Bayyati often emphasizing other degrees<br/>such as the fourth (viewed as the lowest note of a tetrachord called<br/>Buselik in Turkish theory but Nahawand in the Arab usage, F#-G#-A-B).</p><p>In other situations, this small difference of a comma may distinguish<br/>maqamat varying more dramatically from each other in some other tuning<br/>systems, but here by only a fine and discreet nuance:</p><p>Maqam Rast (Acemli or Nirz Rast flavor)</p><p>         Rast             Rast       tone<br/> |-----------------|----------------|....|<br/> F#    G#    Bb    B    C#    Eb    E    F#<br/> 0     208   363  495   704   858  990  1200<br/>   208    155   132  210   154   132  210</p><p>Maqam Nihavend (supraminor flavor)</p><p>                   Ascending</p><p>       Nihavend      tone        Hijaz<br/> |-----------------|......|-----------------|<br/> F#    G#    A*    B      C#    D*     F    F#<br/> 0     208  341   495    704   837   1068  1200<br/>   208   132   154    210   132   231   132</p><p>                  Descending</p><p>       Nihavend      tone        Segah<br/> |-----------------|......|-----------------|<br/> F#    G#    A*    B      C#    D*    E*    F#<br/> 0     208  341   495    704   837   1045  1200<br/>   208   132   154    210   132   208   155</p><p>To accentuate this point of very subtle distinctions, I have realized<br/>the upper Hijaz tetrachord of the ascending form as C#-D*-F-F# or<br/>0-132-363-496 cents (132-231-132 cents), although a more conventional<br/>Hijaz at 0-132-418-496 cents or 132-286-77 cents would also be<br/>possible. For the descending or Segah form of this tetrachord, I use<br/>0-132-341-496 cents, or 132-208-155 cents. keeping a perfect fifth<br/>between the third and seventh degrees of the maqam (at 341 and 1045<br/>cents).</p><p>Here the supraminor third of Nihavend differs from the regular minor<br/>third of Buselik by a diesis or about 55 cents (286 and 341 cents), as<br/>does the submajor third of Rast from the regular major third of Mahur<br/>(363 and 418 cents). However, the thirds of Nihavend and Rast differ<br/>by only a comma (341 and 363 cents), the fine difference between<br/>supraminor and submajor (or roughly 15 and 16 commas).</p><p>A technical note: in these examples I have tried to favor locations<br/>where I can and do actually play the indicated maqamat using two<br/>12-note keyboards. On a generalized keyboard, some other and possibly<br/>more illustrative choices would be more practical, for example with<br/>Huseyni and Arab Bayyati starting on perde dugah (A#, in the naming<br/>system suggested above).</p><p>As suggested, the 79-MOS would have close equivalents for most of<br/>these examples. A nice point is that while the style of intonation<br/>would general suggest pure or wide (supra-Pythagorean) fifths,<br/>sometimes narrow fifths (or wide fourths) could be used to advantage.<br/>Thus for the final examples of Nihavend, the supraminor third at 341<br/>cents could best be mapped to the smaller (and arguably yet better)<br/>332.030 cents in the 79-MOS, with the supraminor sixth mapping to the<br/>almost identical size of 837.785 cents. Between these degrees would be<br/>a meantone fourth of some 505 cents, or about 1/3 Holdrian comma wide<br/>-- thus showing the utility of such fourths even in a style which, in<br/>the regular 704.607-cent tuning or 1024-EDO variation, is achieved<br/>with consistently wide fifths or narrow fourths.</p><p>With many thanks,</p><p>Margo Schulter<br/>mschulter@...</p></div><h3>Ozan Yarman &#x3C;ozanyarman@...&#x3E;</h3><span>9/8/2008 9:17:06 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Hello Margo,</p><p>On Sep 2, 2008, at 11:29 AM, Margo Schulter wrote:</p><p>&gt; Hello, Ozan and all.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Much inspired by your discussions of the 79-MOS and Ozan24, and by our<br/>&gt; recent dialogues, I have decided to post a table of the perdeler or<br/>&gt; steps in the 704.607-cent regular temperament that has been the<br/>&gt; subject of some of my recent articles.

______________________________________________________________________<br/>&gt; ----------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; A pleasant feature of this tuning is the subtle distinction of about<br/>&gt; 21-22 cents, or not quite a Holdrian comma, between small and large<br/>&gt; neutral seconds at around 132/154 cents -- and likewise other neutral<br/>&gt; categories at 341/363, 837/859, and 1046/1068 cents. At certain<br/>&gt; locations, one can thus distinguish from the same final or tonic<br/>&gt; different shadings typical of certain maqamat.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; For example, taking C# as our final, we can play either an Arab<br/>&gt; Bayyati where the smaller neutral second is preferred above the final<br/>&gt; but a wider neutral sixth is favored as an alternative inflection to<br/>&gt; the usual minor sixth; or a Turkish Huseyni where the larger neutral<br/>&gt; second might be placed before the smaller in the lower tetrachord:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Maqam Bayyati (Arab interpretation)<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;                                859<br/>&gt;                                 Bb<br/>&gt;  C#    D*    E    F#    G#    A     B     C#<br/>&gt;  0    132   286   496   704  782   990   1200<br/>&gt;    132   154   210   208   77   208   210<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;</p><p>The scale is also that of Ushshaq.</p><p>&gt; Maqam Huseyni<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;  C#     Eb   E    F#    G#    Bb    B      C#<br/>&gt;  0     154  286   496   704   859  990    1200<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;</p><p>A marvelous rendition.</p><p>&gt; Such a modulation is rather subtle, if both forms are used in a single<br/>&gt; piece, since both maqamat might be regarded to belong to the same<br/>&gt; _fasila_ or &quot;family&quot; in an Arab view, sharing a lower tetrachord with<br/>&gt; two middle or neutral seconds plus an upper tone to complete the<br/>&gt; fourth. Of course, the most important difference is in the seyir or<br/>&gt; typical melodic development for each, with Huseyni emphasizing the<br/>&gt; fifth degree (perde huseyni when the final is on perde dugah, its<br/>&gt; regular location), and Arab Bayyati often emphasizing other degrees<br/>&gt; such as the fourth (viewed as the lowest note of a tetrachord called<br/>&gt; Buselik in Turkish theory but Nahawand in the Arab usage, F#-G#-A-B).<br/>&gt;</p><p>Very good!</p><p>&gt; In other situations, this small difference of a comma may distinguish<br/>&gt; maqamat varying more dramatically from each other in some other tuning<br/>&gt; systems, but here by only a fine and discreet nuance:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Maqam Rast (Acemli or Nirz Rast flavor)<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;         Rast             Rast       tone<br/>&gt; |-----------------|----------------|....|<br/>&gt; F#    G#    Bb    B    C#    Eb    E    F#<br/>&gt; 0     208   363  495   704   858  990  1200<br/>&gt;   208    155   132  210   154   132  210<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;</p><p>This is a fine Ajemli Rast.

For the descending or Segah form of this tetrachord, I use<br/>&gt; 0-132-341-496 cents, or 132-208-155 cents. keeping a perfect fifth<br/>&gt; between the third and seventh degrees of the maqam (at 341 and 1045<br/>&gt; cents).<br/>&gt;</p><p>155 cents is not appropriate as an interval between E* and F# for the descending scale of Nihavend I&apos;m afraid.</p><p>&gt; Here the supraminor third of Nihavend differs from the regular minor<br/>&gt; third of Buselik by a diesis or about 55 cents (286 and 341 cents), as<br/>&gt; does the submajor third of Rast from the regular major third of Mahur<br/>&gt; (363 and 418 cents). However, the thirds of Nihavend and Rast differ<br/>&gt; by only a comma (341 and 363 cents), the fine difference between<br/>&gt; supraminor and submajor (or roughly 15 and 16 commas).<br/>&gt;</p><p>This is very much agreeable.</p><p>&gt; A technical note: in these examples I have tried to favor locations<br/>&gt; where I can and do actually play the indicated maqamat using two<br/>&gt; 12-note keyboards. On a generalized keyboard, some other and possibly<br/>&gt; more illustrative choices would be more practical, for example with<br/>&gt; Huseyni and Arab Bayyati starting on perde dugah (A#, in the naming<br/>&gt; system suggested above).<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; As suggested, the 79-MOS would have close equivalents for most of<br/>&gt; these examples. A nice point is that while the style of intonation<br/>&gt; would general suggest pure or wide (supra-Pythagorean) fifths,<br/>&gt; sometimes narrow fifths (or wide fourths) could be used to advantage.<br/>&gt; Thus for the final examples of Nihavend, the supraminor third at 341<br/>&gt; cents could best be mapped to the smaller (and arguably yet better)<br/>&gt; 332.030 cents in the 79-MOS, with the supraminor sixth mapping to the<br/>&gt; almost identical size of 837.785 cents. Between these degrees would be<br/>&gt; a meantone fourth of some 505 cents, or about 1/3 Holdrian comma wide<br/>&gt; -- thus showing the utility of such fourths even in a style which, in<br/>&gt; the regular 704.607-cent tuning or 1024-EDO variation, is achieved<br/>&gt; with consistently wide fifths or narrow fourths.<br/>&gt;</p><p>Splendid.</p><p>&gt; With many thanks,<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Margo Schulter<br/>&gt; mschulter@...<br/>&gt;</p><p>Oz.</p></div><h3>Margo Schulter &#x3C;mschulter@...&#x3E;</h3><span>9/12/2008 6:22:43 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>&gt; Hello Margo,</p><p>Hello Ozan.

Here this tuning is<br/>&gt;&gt; given as realized in 1024-EDO, a standard for some synthesizers,<br/>&gt;&gt; where the average size of the 23 fifths is about 704.603 cents.</p><p>&gt; That is a fine happenstance!</p><p>Yes, I was pleasantly surprised that the fit should be so close. There<br/>are 17 fifths at 704.297 cents, and 6 fifths at 705.469 cents. The<br/>wider fifths are at Eb-Bb, G-D, and B-F# on each keyboard.</p><p>&gt;&gt; Incidentally, the Turkish term _perde_ or &quot;note, pitch&quot; (plural<br/>&gt;&gt; perdeler) might possibly be related, I might guess, to the Persian<br/>&gt;&gt; _pardeh_, which can have a similar meaning and more specifically<br/>&gt;&gt; signify the &quot;fret&quot; of an instrument.</p><p>&gt; But we use perde not just for note or pitch, but also to indicate<br/>&gt; frets in Turkiye. The usage is the same for all Middle Eastern nations.</p><p>Thank you for educating me on this: maybe, like the origins of some of<br/>the maqamat, it might be an interesting question what language this<br/>term originated in. In reading Arab theory in English, so far, I&apos;m not<br/>sure if I&apos;ve seen any related term: but perde and pardeh seem common.</p><p>&gt;&gt; In naming the perdeler, I have tried to be guided both by Arab and<br/>&gt;&gt; Turkish practice, and specifically by some of your conventions as<br/>&gt;&gt; they might apply to a system with fewer alternatives than the<br/>&gt;&gt; 79-MOS. When in doubt, I have taken the forms of Maqam Rast (as<br/>&gt;&gt; realized in this temperament) as normative: that is, in placing<br/>&gt;&gt; segah and evc or evdj (Arab awj) at 363 and 1068 cents, and hisar<br/>&gt;&gt; at 859 cents for the sixth degree of Ajemli or Nirz Rast.</p><p>&gt; Nirz Rast? Where does that name come from?</p><p>Evidently the name Nirz Rast in Arab theory is another term for a<br/>maqam also called Nairuz, an Arabic version of the name for the Iranic<br/>New Year festival, with Nirz shortened from Nairuz. I also sometimes<br/>call it Zalzalian Rast; Ajemli Rast is very descriptive. In commas, I<br/>think of this as approximately 976|976|9, with the two conjuct Rast<br/>tetrachords. Of course, there are various ajnas to be found, and some<br/>Arab theorists may view it, for example, as disjunct Rast plus what is<br/>called Bayyati (i.e. Ushshaq), 976-9-769, although I would say that<br/>the upper 769 might be more like Huseyni than like the Arab version of<br/>Ushshaq or &quot;Bayyati,&quot; which 679 would better express.</p><p>&gt; An interesting feature is that perde buselik is at an almost just<br/>&gt; 14/11, or about 18.5 Holdrian commas, sometimes suggested as a<br/>&gt; preferred location by certain Near Eastern theorists.<br/>&gt;</p><p>   [Excerpt from my table of perdeler or steps, which I&apos;ve trimmed]</p><p>&gt; ---------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>&gt;   8     C     363.281     21/17      Segah              24   362.215<br/>&gt; ---------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>&gt;  18     F     858.984     23/14      Hisar              56   852,878<br/>&gt;                                                         57   867.970<br/>&gt; ---------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p>&gt; So far so good.</p><p>Our discussions since I made this table, however, raise one point,<br/>since 859 cents is the perfect fourth of segah at 363 cents, might it<br/>better be named dik hisar (&quot;steep Hisar&quot;), and 837 cents be considered<br/>simply hisar?

What a pleasure it now is to have<br/>this document conveniently at hand, and to begin studying and<br/>absorbing its many facets.</p><p>As one method of celebrating this occasion, I have decided to seek<br/>clarification on a point raised in one of your recent messages, with<br/>due apologies if you have already discussed this point in some<br/>previous postings here, or possibly in other writings or forums.</p><p>You mentioned that Maqam Chargah has been presented in some recent<br/>Turkish theory as what might be described as simply a transposition of<br/>the ascending form of Maqam Mahur from perde rast to chargah. as<br/>opposed to the &quot;original&quot; tradition to which you remain true. Here I<br/>would like to venture a guess as to two forms that tradition might<br/>take, and warmly invite your response -- having been alerted by a jins<br/>or genus Chargah mentioned at page 121 of your dissertation in<br/>connection with Maqam Saba that my initial impression might not be the<br/>correct one.</p><p>That first impression was that Maqam Chargah in Turkiye, like Maqam<br/>Jahargah in the Arab world (the spelling variation reflecting a<br/>difference of phonology between the Persian and Arabic languages),<br/>involves disjunct Mahur and Rast tetrachords, as would accord with<br/>al-Sabbagh&apos;s suggested tuning for this maqam, as reported by Ali Jihad<br/>Racy, of around 9-9-4-9-9-7-6 commas. Here is my interpretation in a<br/>regular 24-note temperament at 704.607 cents, available as it happens<br/>within a single 12-MOS keyboard:</p><p>               Mahur                              Rast<br/>    |-------------------------|   T    |-------------------------|<br/>        T         T       B       T        T       Jk       Js<br/>       209       209      77     209      209      154      132<br/>    E        F#        G#     A       B        C#       Eb       E<br/>    0       209       418    495     705       914     1068     1200<br/> chargah   neva     huseyni ajem   gerdaniye muhayyer   tiz     tiz<br/>                                                       segah   chargah</p><p>In the above notation, I have borrowed some signs from medieval and<br/>modern Near Eastern theory to show the intervals of a _tanini_ or<br/>whole tone at 209 cents (T); a larger mujenneb (Jk) and smaller<br/>mujenneb (Js), middle or neutral seconds at 154 and 132 cents; and a<br/>_bakiye_ or usual limma at 77 cents (B). These tempered sizes<br/>correspond to al-Sabbagh&apos;s approximate steps based on Pythagorean<br/>tuning or 53-EDO of 9, 7, 6, and 4 commas respectively (around 204,<br/>158, 136, and 90 cents).</p><p>However, your Chargah tetrachord alerted me to a rather different<br/>possibility: a connection to the Persian Dastgah-e Chahargah, which<br/>features tetrachords generally like those termed Hijaz in Arab and<br/>Turkish theory. Your tetrachord occurring in a descending form of Saba<br/>as one side of the complex _terkib_ or composite maqam is as follows:</p><p>          |---------------------------------|<br/>         1/1       15/14        195/154   75/56<br/>          0         119           409      506<br/>             15/14        13/11      55/52<br/>              119          289        97</p><p>This looks much more like a relative of Persian Chahargah than of the<br/>Mahur-Rast type of Maqam Jahargah that al-Sabbagh describes and I much<br/>relish. Intuitively I might describe this as 16-38-13 steps of 159-EDO.<br/>In your 79-MOS, as you note, it is steps 33-41-60-67 counting from<br/>perde rast, or 8-19-7 steps.</p><p>You&apos;ll understand how I could easily picture a Turkish school like AEU<br/>seeking to have &quot;maqamat without quartertones&quot; taking Maqam Chargah or<br/>Jahargah in the common Arab understanding, and seeking to &quot;Mahurize&quot;<br/>the upper tetrachord as 9-9-4 rather than 9-7-6. However, I am curious<br/>whether your jins of Chargah as used in the descending portion of the<br/>seyir for Maqam Saba could be a clue that the relevant version of<br/>Maqam Chargah could instead involve this tetrachord.</p><p>WIth many thanks,</p><p>Margo Schulter<br/>mschulter@...</p></div><h3>Margo Schulter &#x3C;mschulter@...&#x3E;</h3><span>9/17/2008 4:29:47 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>---------------------------------------<br/>                  Sonnet for Ozan Yarman<br/>                           or<br/>                   Qanun librumque cano<br/>        ----------------------------------------</p><p>Behold the artful zither and the book<br/>By which the siege of Istanbul is laid;<br/>High outposts the noble city overlook<br/>With Mutazilah logic well arrayed.</p><p>By diapente and diatessaron<br/>Both pure and tempered, with middle steps abounding,<br/>Theory&apos;s encumbering walls are overthrown,<br/>The true seyir most joyfully resounding.</p><p>The art of Vicentino is refined,<br/>A fairer song and poetry to nurse:<br/>Each house and nation on these strings may find<br/>A fitting intonation for its verse.</p><p>O scion worthy of the name Osman:<br/>We sing thee, peaceful conqueror Ozan.</p><p>Margo Schulter<br/>mschulter@...<br/>17 September 2008</p></div><h3>Margo Schulter &#x3C;mschulter@...&#x3E;</h3><span>9/17/2008 4:36:21 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Dear Mario and All,</p><p>Please let me say that as a participant on this list, I feel a<br/>responsibility to help promote an atmosphere of hospitality and good<br/>humor. As someone who has for some years sought out tuning<br/>&quot;discoveries&quot; which are often rediscoveries, I see this as a common<br/>situation for any earnest devotee of the arts and scientists.</p><p>First of all, a tuning of 12 notes with 11 pure fifths is most worthy,<br/>and its established history does not make it any less so. Welcoming a<br/>&quot;teaching moment,&quot; I would observe that this is an ideal tuning for<br/>three and more centuries of European music, and an important side of<br/>Near Eastern music also, although many more than 12 fifths are<br/>required in order to obtain the middle or neutral intervals so vital<br/>to this style.</p><p>To emphasize the virtues of the tuning you have described and answer<br/>Brad&apos;s question at the same time: tuning a chain of 11 pure fifths<br/>from Eb to G# appears to be a widespread practice of the 14th<br/>century. It nicely fits the transcendent keyboard music of the<br/>Robertsbridge Codex, as Mark Lindley has noted, and I would be<br/>delighted to use the Eb-G# tuning for a wide range of music from<br/>Perotin (and earlier) to Machaut.</p><p>Around 1400 or so, a tuning in which some of the customary sharps (F#,<br/>C#, G#) are actually tuned as flats by pure fifths down or fourths up<br/>from Eb. One popular choice is Gb-B; as Lindley notes, some pieces of<br/>this area seem mostly to avoid the fifth B-F#, and theorists note that<br/>this fifth is not available on current keyboards.</p><p>One reason Brad might not have discussed these famous tunings is that<br/>they really pertain to medieval European music, not to his main era of<br/>the 18th century. There&apos;s a general lesson to be learned here: a<br/>tuning useful for one purpose may be quite unfitting for another.</p><p>For example, a few days ago, someone posted a question here about a<br/>mathematical tuning relationship with which I am intimately familiar,<br/>relying on it in a number of my favorite tunings. Eagerly I addressed<br/>his question of what could be made of this pattern. Reading his<br/>further clarification, however, I knew in a moment that we were<br/>addressing radically different styles, with his perceptive<br/>mathematical observation nicely serving my musical purposes rather<br/>than his.</p><p>Mario, I am especially concerned that humor should serve to build<br/>friendship and solidarity among us who participate here. George Secor,<br/>a great musician and artist of tuning design, was playfully noting<br/>that indeed you were following in the footsteps of Pythagoras, and of<br/>many world musical traditions which use a tuning of pure fifths and<br/>fourths as at least one important ingredient of their musics. We might<br/>at once smile together at a mutual recognition that your discovery was<br/>in fact a rediscovery, and take the occasion to wonder at the great<br/>music which has been written and might be written with this system.</p><p>I conclude by noting that while 12 notes tuned in pure fifths<br/>(producing 11 of these pure intervals) are ideal for much medieval<br/>European music, a chain of 53 notes in such pure fifths will, in<br/>effect, form a delightful circle, with one fifth made narrow by about<br/>3.62 cents in order to obtain a pure octave and complete the circle.<br/>Such a circle would be delightfully rich, and some generalized<br/>keyboards now available could gracefully support it.</p><p>What we mostly find on the Tuning List is that different people have<br/>different stylistic purposes, inviting different tunings, so that no<br/>one is definitive or exclusive in its virtues.</p><p>A virtue of special importance, however, may be a mutual tempering<br/>process by which we affirm each other&apos;s enthusiasm even while sharing<br/>information that may lend a fuller perspective -- so that the mirror<br/>of music or _Speculum musicae_, as Jacob of Liege or Jacob de Montibus<br/>titled his great treatise, is often a place at once of delight and<br/>laughter as we listen and gaze within.</p><p>With many thanks,</p><p>Margo Schulter<br/>mschulter@...</p></div><h3>Ozan Yarman &#x3C;ozanyarman@...&#x3E;</h3><span>9/17/2008 5:02:30 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Hi Margo!</p><p>On Sep 13, 2008, at 4:22 AM, Margo Schulter wrote:</p><p>&gt;&gt; Hello Margo,<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Hello Ozan.

Here this tuning is<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt; given as realized in 1024-EDO, a standard for some synthesizers,<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt; where the average size of the 23 fifths is about 704.603 cents.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt; That is a fine happenstance!<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Yes, I was pleasantly surprised that the fit should be so close. There<br/>&gt; are 17 fifths at 704.297 cents, and 6 fifths at 705.469 cents. The<br/>&gt; wider fifths are at Eb-Bb, G-D, and B-F# on each keyboard.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt; Incidentally, the Turkish term _perde_ or &quot;note, pitch&quot; (plural<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt; perdeler) might possibly be related, I might guess, to the Persian<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt; _pardeh_, which can have a similar meaning and more specifically<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt; signify the &quot;fret&quot; of an instrument.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt; But we use perde not just for note or pitch, but also to indicate<br/>&gt;&gt; frets in Turkiye. The usage is the same for all Middle Eastern &gt;&gt; nations.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Thank you for educating me on this: maybe, like the origins of some of<br/>&gt; the maqamat, it might be an interesting question what language this<br/>&gt; term originated in. In reading Arab theory in English, so far, I&apos;m not<br/>&gt; sure if I&apos;ve seen any related term: but perde and pardeh seem common.<br/>&gt;</p><p>They are one and the same. The word originates in Persian as far as I know.</p><p>&gt;&gt;&gt; In naming the perdeler, I have tried to be guided both by Arab and<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt; Turkish practice, and specifically by some of your conventions as<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt; they might apply to a system with fewer alternatives than the<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt; 79-MOS. When in doubt, I have taken the forms of Maqam Rast (as<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt; realized in this temperament) as normative: that is, in placing<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt; segah and evc or evdj (Arab awj) at 363 and 1068 cents, and hisar<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt; at 859 cents for the sixth degree of Ajemli or Nirz Rast.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt; Nirz Rast? Where does that name come from?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Evidently the name Nirz Rast in Arab theory is another term for a<br/>&gt; maqam also called Nairuz, an Arabic version of the name for the Iranic<br/>&gt; New Year festival, with Nirz shortened from Nairuz. I also sometimes<br/>&gt; call it Zalzalian Rast; Ajemli Rast is very descriptive. In commas, I<br/>&gt; think of this as approximately 976|976|9, with the two conjuct Rast<br/>&gt; tetrachords. Of course, there are various ajnas to be found, and some<br/>&gt; Arab theorists may view it, for example, as disjunct Rast plus what is<br/>&gt; called Bayyati (i.e. Ushshaq), 976-9-769, although I would say that<br/>&gt; the upper 769 might be more like Huseyni than like the Arab version of<br/>&gt; Ushshaq or &quot;Bayyati,&quot; which 679 would better express.<br/>&gt;</p><p>For those who did not follow the previous posts, let me clarify that ajnas are the plural of jins, which stands for genus and signifies the divisions of the tetrachord in medieval Islamic music theory. Since the late 19th Century, the term is applied to the divisions of pentachords too. I had at one point thought that ajnas could only be considered divisions of the tetrachord, but it occurred to me maqams such as Penchgah, Nihavend, Huseyni, Saba and even Huzzam require pentachords  to explain their scales in a wholesome manner.</p><p>As for Nawruz, Abdulbaki Nasir Dede gives a detailed description which I interpret as follows:</p><p>1. An ascending-descending Nihavend pentachord from perde neva to muhayyer, G-A-Bb-c-d<br/>2. A Mahur tetrachord from perde chargah to perde ajem, F-G-A-Bb<br/>3.

Some other sources of Arab theory<br/>&gt; prefer Nairuz, for example &lt;<a href="http://www.maqamworld.com/maqamat/rast.html">http://www.maqamworld.com/maqamat/rast.html</a>&gt; &gt;.<br/>&gt; Interestingly, d&apos;Erlanger has two spellings, Nairuz or Niriz, with the<br/>&gt; latter close to Nirz. While al-Sabbagh, as cited by Marcus, calls the<br/>&gt; maqam simmply Nirz, some others have Nirz Rast.<br/>&gt;</p><p>That is a perversion.

Thus, in a supraminor flavor,<br/>&gt; something like 967-9-679, but with the smaller neutral second at 132<br/>&gt; cents a tad smaller than 6 full commas.</p><p>On second thought, this rendition somewhat resembles Nihavend, though is not fully Nihavend!</p><p>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt; Here the supraminor third of Nihavend differs from the regular<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt; minor third of Buselik by a diesis or about 55 cents (286 and 341<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt; cents), as does the submajor third of Rast from the regular major<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt; third of Mahur (363 and 418 cents). However, the thirds of Nihavend<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt; and Rast differ by only a comma (341 and 363 cents), the fine<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt; difference between supraminor and submajor (or roughly 15 and 16<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt; commas).<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt; This is very much agreeable.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Again, your guidance is welcome, and the rule of a descending version<br/>&gt; with the seventh degree at 16/9 nicely resolves my uncertainty.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt; Oz.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; With many thanks,<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Margo<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;</p><p>Cordially,<br/>Oz.</p></div><h3>Ozan Yarman &#x3C;ozanyarman@...&#x3E;</h3><span>9/17/2008 5:50:39 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>O, Margo, you are very kind with your words.

Here I<br/>&gt; would like to venture a guess as to two forms that tradition might<br/>&gt; take, and warmly invite your response -- having been alerted by a jins<br/>&gt; or genus Chargah mentioned at page 121 of your dissertation in<br/>&gt; connection with Maqam Saba that my initial impression might not be the<br/>&gt; correct one.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; That first impression was that Maqam Chargah in Turkiye, like Maqam<br/>&gt; Jahargah in the Arab world (the spelling variation reflecting a<br/>&gt; difference of phonology between the Persian and Arabic languages),<br/>&gt; involves disjunct Mahur and Rast tetrachords, as would accord with<br/>&gt; al-Sabbagh&apos;s suggested tuning for this maqam, as reported by Ali Jihad<br/>&gt; Racy, of around 9-9-4-9-9-7-6 commas. Here is my interpretation in a<br/>&gt; regular 24-note temperament at 704.607 cents, available as it happens<br/>&gt; within a single 12-MOS keyboard:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;               Mahur                              Rast<br/>&gt;    |-------------------------|   T    |-------------------------|<br/>&gt;        T         T       B       T        T       Jk       Js<br/>&gt;       209       209      77     209      209      154      132<br/>&gt;    E        F#        G#     A       B        C#       Eb       E<br/>&gt;    0       209       418    495     705       914     1068     1200<br/>&gt; chargah   neva     huseyni ajem   gerdaniye muhayyer   tiz     tiz<br/>&gt;                                                       segah   chargah<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; In the above notation, I have borrowed some signs from medieval and<br/>&gt; modern Near Eastern theory to show the intervals of a _tanini_ or<br/>&gt; whole tone at 209 cents (T); a larger mujenneb (Jk)</p><p>Mujannab-i kabir</p><p>&gt; and smaller<br/>&gt; mujenneb (Js)</p><p>Mujannab-i sagir</p><p>&gt; , middle or neutral seconds at 154 and 132 cents</p><p>As opposed to AEU 114 cents</p><p>&gt; ; and a<br/>&gt; _bakiye_ or usual limma at 77 cents (B). These tempered sizes<br/>&gt; correspond to al-Sabbagh&apos;s approximate steps based on Pythagorean<br/>&gt; tuning or 53-EDO of 9, 7, 6, and 4 commas respectively (around 204,<br/>&gt; 158, 136, and 90 cents).<br/>&gt;</p><p>Suphi Ezgi writes about discussing with Saadettin Arel about the whole matter of using perde evdj instead of mahur in maqam Chargah. He nonchalantly confesses to their having decided to replace evdj with mahur because it did not agree with their conceptions of a main scale composed of natural, unaccidented notes!</p><p>&gt; However, your Chargah tetrachord alerted me to a rather different<br/>&gt; possibility: a connection to the Persian Dastgah-e Chahargah, which<br/>&gt; features tetrachords generally like those termed Hijaz in Arab and<br/>&gt; Turkish theory. Your tetrachord occurring in a descending form of Saba<br/>&gt; as one side of the complex _terkib_ or composite maqam is as follows:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;          |---------------------------------|<br/>&gt;         1/1       15/14        195/154   75/56<br/>&gt;          0         119           409      506<br/>&gt;             15/14        13/11      55/52<br/>&gt;              119          289        97<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; This looks much more like a relative of Persian Chahargah than of the<br/>&gt; Mahur-Rast type of Maqam Jahargah that al-Sabbagh describes and I much<br/>&gt; relish.</p><p>Indeed so. But this is only half the picture just as it was the case with Arabs. This elusive maqam has been split in two by vast geographic distances into what you have described above. The correct Chargah, in my opinion, is the UNION of Turkish, Arabic and Persian traditions (except AEU of course!).</p><p>&gt; Intuitively I might describe this as 16-38-13 steps of 159-EDO.<br/>&gt; In your 79-MOS, as you note, it is steps 33-41-60-67 counting from<br/>&gt; perde rast, or 8-19-7 steps.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; You&apos;ll understand how I could easily picture a Turkish school like AEU<br/>&gt; seeking to have &quot;maqamat without quartertones&quot; taking Maqam Chargah or<br/>&gt; Jahargah in the common Arab understanding, and seeking to &quot;Mahurize&quot;<br/>&gt; the upper tetrachord as 9-9-4 rather than 9-7-6.</p><p>That is precisely what seems to have happened. Even the 9-8-5 comma rendition offended Ezgi and Arel that they deemed it necessary to &quot;Mahurize&quot;, that is to say, twist and contort Chargah to their whims.</p><p>&gt; However, I am curious<br/>&gt; whether your jins of Chargah as used in the descending portion of the<br/>&gt; seyir for Maqam Saba could be a clue that the relevant version of<br/>&gt; Maqam Chargah could instead involve this tetrachord.<br/>&gt;</p><p>I do believe, just as Nasir Dede describes, that Chargah is a Saba with a finalis on chargah, comprising, moreover, a modulation that involves the alteration of the second degree of the Chargah genus to yield Mahur, and the second degree of the Hijaz genus, to yield Rast.</p><p>Though, I admit that, in a hurry to finish my dissertation, I have not remarked about the inclination of Gb and Eb in (F Gb A Bb C Db E F) to rise even higher than specified.

Here this tuning is<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; given as realized in 1024-EDO, a standard for some synthesizers,<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; where the average size of the 23 fifths is about 704.603 cents.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt; That is a fine happenstance!<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; Yes, I was pleasantly surprised that the fit should be so close. There<br/>&gt; &gt; are 17 fifths at 704.297 cents, and 6 fifths at 705.469 cents. The<br/>&gt; &gt; wider fifths are at Eb-Bb, G-D, and B-F# on each keyboard.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; Incidentally, the Turkish term _perde_ or &quot;note, pitch&quot; (plural<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; perdeler) might possibly be related, I might guess, to the Persian<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; _pardeh_, which can have a similar meaning and more specifically<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; signify the &quot;fret&quot; of an instrument.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt; But we use perde not just for note or pitch, but also to indicate<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt; frets in Turkiye. The usage is the same for all Middle Eastern<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt; nations.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; Thank you for educating me on this: maybe, like the origins of some of<br/>&gt; &gt; the maqamat, it might be an interesting question what language this<br/>&gt; &gt; term originated in. In reading Arab theory in English, so far, I&apos;m not<br/>&gt; &gt; sure if I&apos;ve seen any related term: but perde and pardeh seem common.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; They are one and the same. The word originates in Persian as far as I<br/>&gt; know.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; In naming the perdeler, I have tried to be guided both by Arab and<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; Turkish practice, and specifically by some of your conventions as<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; they might apply to a system with fewer alternatives than the<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; 79-MOS. When in doubt, I have taken the forms of Maqam Rast (as<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; realized in this temperament) as normative: that is, in placing<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; segah and evc or evdj (Arab awj) at 363 and 1068 cents, and hisar<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; at 859 cents for the sixth degree of Ajemli or Nirz Rast.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt; Nirz Rast? Where does that name come from?<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; Evidently the name Nirz Rast in Arab theory is another term for a<br/>&gt; &gt; maqam also called Nairuz, an Arabic version of the name for the Iranic<br/>&gt; &gt; New Year festival, with Nirz shortened from Nairuz. I also sometimes<br/>&gt; &gt; call it Zalzalian Rast; Ajemli Rast is very descriptive. In commas, I<br/>&gt; &gt; think of this as approximately 976|976|9, with the two conjuct Rast<br/>&gt; &gt; tetrachords. Of course, there are various ajnas to be found, and some<br/>&gt; &gt; Arab theorists may view it, for example, as disjunct Rast plus what is<br/>&gt; &gt; called Bayyati (i.e. Ushshaq), 976-9-769, although I would say that<br/>&gt; &gt; the upper 769 might be more like Huseyni than like the Arab version of<br/>&gt; &gt; Ushshaq or &quot;Bayyati,&quot; which 679 would better express.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; For those who did not follow the previous posts, let me clarify that<br/>&gt; ajnas are the plural of jins, which stands for genus and signifies the<br/>&gt; divisions of the tetrachord in medieval Islamic music theory. Since<br/>&gt; the late 19th Century, the term is applied to the divisions of<br/>&gt; pentachords too. I had at one point thought that ajnas could only be<br/>&gt; considered divisions of the tetrachord, but it occurred to me maqams<br/>&gt; such as Penchgah, Nihavend, Huseyni, Saba and even Huzzam require<br/>&gt; pentachords  to explain their scales in a wholesome manner.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; As for Nawruz, Abdulbaki Nasir Dede gives a detailed description which<br/>&gt; I interpret as follows:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; 1. An ascending-descending Nihavend pentachord from perde neva to<br/>&gt; muhayyer, G-A-Bb-c-d<br/>&gt; 2. A Mahur tetrachord from perde chargah to perde ajem, F-G-A-Bb<br/>&gt; 3. A possible Mahur tetrachord from perde ajem to perde sunbule, Bb-c-<br/>&gt; d-eb<br/>&gt; 4. Finalis on ajem, Bb<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; There are also Nawruz-i Ajem and Nawruz-i Sultani in Nasir Dede&apos;s<br/>&gt; treatise Tedkik u Tahkik. The latter is defined as a Nawruz-i Ajem<br/>&gt; that makes a Rast cadence. Nasir Dede says he gave the name himself as<br/>&gt; tribute to his patron Sultan Selim III. Nawruz-i Ajem, as the name<br/>&gt; implies, a Nawruz that concludes with Ajem. Ajem, according to Nasir<br/>&gt; Dede, is:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; c-Bb-A-Ab-G-F-Ed-D<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Accordingly, Nawruz-i Sultani becomes:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; eb-d-c-Bb: Mahur on ajem<br/>&gt; c-Bb-Ab-G-F: Nihavend on chargah<br/>&gt; F-Ed-D-C: Rast on rast<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Still, no sign of Huseini or Bayyati/Ushshaq on the upper conjunct<br/>&gt; pentachord.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt; An interesting feature is that perde buselik is at an almost just<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt; 14/11, or about 18.5 Holdrian commas, sometimes suggested as a<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt; preferred location by certain Near Eastern theorists.<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;   [Excerpt from my table of perdeler or steps, which I&apos;ve trimmed]<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt; ---------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt;  8     C     363.281     21/17      Segah              24   362.215<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt; ---------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt; 18     F     858.984     23/14      Hisar              56   852,878<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt;                                                        57   867.970<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt; ---------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt; So far so good.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; Our discussions since I made this table, however, raise one point,<br/>&gt; &gt; since 859 cents is the perfect fourth of segah at 363 cents, might it<br/>&gt; &gt; better be named dik hisar (&quot;steep Hisar&quot;), and 837 cents be considered<br/>&gt; &gt; simply hisar?

Some other sources of Arab theory<br/>&gt; &gt; prefer Nairuz, for example<br/>&lt;<a href="http://www.maqamworld.com/maqamat/rast.html">http://www.maqamworld.com/maqamat/rast.html</a><br/>&gt; &gt; &gt;.<br/>&gt; &gt; Interestingly, d&apos;Erlanger has two spellings, Nairuz or Niriz, with the<br/>&gt; &gt; latter close to Nirz. While al-Sabbagh, as cited by Marcus, calls the<br/>&gt; &gt; maqam simmply Nirz, some others have Nirz Rast.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; That is a perversion. Nawruz can be likened to this modulation in<br/>&gt; Western music:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; G minor =&gt; F Major =&gt; Bb Major =&gt; Eb Major =&gt; Bb Major.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt; Maqam Nihavend (supraminor flavor)<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt;                  Ascending<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt;      Nihavend      tone        Hijaz<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt; |-----------------|......|-----------------|<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt; F#    G#    A*    B      C#    D*     F    F#<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt; 0     208  341   495    704   837   1068  1200<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt;  208   132   154    210   132   231   132<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt;                 Descending<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt;      Nihavend      tone        Segah<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt; |-----------------|......|-----------------|<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt; F#    G#    A*    B      C#    D*    E*    F#<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt; 0     208  341   495    704   837   1045  1200<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt;  208   132   154    210   132   208   155<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt; An acceptable Nihavend, save for E*, which I believe should be 9/8<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt; lower from F#.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; Ah, this is easily corrected, and the upper tetrachord might now, if I<br/>&gt; &gt; am correct, be called Ushshaq -- if this is fitting for this maqam:<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;                   Descending<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;        Nihavend      tone       Ushshaq<br/>&gt; &gt;  |-----------------|......|-----------------|<br/>&gt; &gt;  F#    G#    A*    B      C#    D*    E    F#<br/>&gt; &gt;  0     208  341   495    704   837   991  1200<br/>&gt; &gt;    208   132   154    210   132   155   209<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;          [...]<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; But I see that this is not acceptable. The third and sixth degrees<br/>&gt; must also be lowered by a diesis each. Nihavend and Buselik appear to<br/>&gt; be the same in your tuning.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt; 155 cents is not appropriate as an interval between E* and F# for<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt; the descending scale of Nihavend I&apos;m afraid.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; Here I may have made my mistake through a desire to have a perfect<br/>&gt; &gt; fifth between the third and seventh degrees (A*-E*); but now I<br/>&gt; &gt; understand that the seventh degree in the descending form should be a<br/>&gt; &gt; 9:8 below the octave of the final or tonic, with a perfect fourth<br/>&gt; &gt; between the fourth and seventh degrees. Thus, in a supraminor flavor,<br/>&gt; &gt; something like 967-9-679, but with the smaller neutral second at 132<br/>&gt; &gt; cents a tad smaller than 6 full commas.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; On second thought, this rendition somewhat resembles Nihavend, though<br/>&gt; is not fully Nihavend!<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; Here the supraminor third of Nihavend differs from the regular<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; minor third of Buselik by a diesis or about 55 cents (286 and 341<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; cents), as does the submajor third of Rast from the regular major<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; third of Mahur (363 and 418 cents). However, the thirds of Nihavend<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; and Rast differ by only a comma (341 and 363 cents), the fine<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; difference between supraminor and submajor (or roughly 15 and 16<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; commas).<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt; This is very much agreeable.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; Again, your guidance is welcome, and the rule of a descending version<br/>&gt; &gt; with the seventh degree at 16/9 nicely resolves my uncertainty.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt; Oz.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; With many thanks,<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; Margo<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Cordially,<br/>&gt; Oz.<br/>&gt;</p></div><h3>Margo Schulter &#x3C;mschulter@...&#x3E;</h3><span>9/19/2008 4:10:04 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Dear Ozan,</p><p>Please forgive me for now being the one who needs to catch up with<br/>your wonderful recent posts and responses -- and with much less reason<br/>than you have for needing wisely and prudently to pace yourself,<br/>although this may be the best policy even when circumstances do not so<br/>obviously require it.</p><p>My mother and I were both very much entertained by your notes and<br/>commentary on my sonnet: the &quot;bombards&quot; were especially fitting,<br/>because one meaning of a bombard is a medieval or Renaissance European<br/>instrument, related to the Near Eastern shawm if I am correct from<br/>which it is derived, known for its penetrating sound.

However, as someone much concerned with the theory of the<br/>Mutazilah era although not familiar with the relevant writings in the<br/>way that you are, I agree that it is a worthy question and one that<br/>can be highly edifying, even if we mostly end up bombarding each other<br/>with more and more friendly questions and arguments! Indeed, that<br/>might be one of the best reasons for asking it.</p><p>Certainly, as you rightly emphasize in your dissertation, Safi al-Din,<br/>and also modern writers such as al-Sabbagh who take a mostly<br/>Pythagorean approach to tuning are hardly shy about discussing middle<br/>or neutral intervals. Urmavi, of course, discusses these middle<br/>intervals at great length and uses them in a variety of JI<br/>tetrachords, but also recommends a Pythagorean 17-MOS which cannot<br/>yield these flavors.</p><p>Although al-Sabbagh&apos;s 24-of-53-EDO tuning, with one break in the chain<br/>of fifths, if I&apos;m right, does yield a few neutral intervals for<br/>maqamat like Rast, which he makes a point of emphasizing should be<br/>tuned 976-9-976 rather than in equal quartertones, still, as Scott<br/>Marcus notes, these intervals are not so ample. If I entered the<br/>tuning correctly into Scala, then there is a chain of 22 fifths among<br/>the 24 notes, so that the neutral flavors aren&apos;t that more prevalent<br/>than in a simple chain of 23 fifths.</p><p>This dramatically contrasts with medieval tunings of Zalzal/al-Farabi<br/>and Ibn Sina for instruments such as the &grave;ud, where Zalzal&apos;s variously<br/>placed wusta (27/22, 39/32, or whatever) signals that neutral flavors<br/>are basic and central to the style -- as well as lots of tetrachords<br/>in Urmavi and Qutb al-Din al-Shirazi. In modern times, of course,<br/>contrasting with al-Sabbagh&apos;s 24-note system (a better example than<br/>AEU, since special ideological considerations obviously don&apos;t apply to<br/>a theorist quite eager to use the comma system to show how neutral<br/>intervals should be tuned), we have Persian theorists such as Hormoz<br/>Farhat, Dariush Anooshfar (see Scala archive, persian.scl and<br/>persian-far.scl), and Dariush Tala&grave;i who leave no doubt that neutral<br/>intervals get priority in theory and practice.</p><p>Curiously, Farhat in his book on the dastgah system does document a<br/>Persian theory seeking to explain tuning in terms of Pythagorean<br/>intervals of a kind produced by 10 or fewer generators -- this means<br/>regular and schismatic or 5-limit flavors, as opposed to the neutral<br/>flavors noted by others. What we find in Farhat and others, based in<br/>part on pragmatic surveys of how people actually fret and tune<br/>instruments such as the tar with its 17 or so steps per octave, are<br/>tunings with lots of Pythagorean and neutral flavors, and a few<br/>5-limit flavors of the kind we might expect from chains of 7-10<br/>generators at or quite close to 3:2.</p><p>If you want a few guesses as to possible factors, here they are:</p><p>      (1) In a historical setting like that of the Mutazilah Era where<br/>          various primes may be used in JI tetrachords and systems,<br/>          including a delightful variety of neutral flavors, the main<br/>          constraining factor may be (as far as I know) the absence of<br/>          a theory of temperament, or more specifically of subtle<br/>          regular temperament or the like. If you prefer a regular<br/>          system of generators, your obvious choice in JI is<br/>          Pythagorean: and unless you go to a 29-MOS or larger,<br/>          neutral flavors will be absent (as in a 17-MOS) or rather<br/>          sparse (as in a regular or nearly-regular 24-note system,<br/>          e.g. al-Sabbagh or AEU). You have a choice of neutral<br/>          flavors, _or_ regularity (maybe especially attractive if you<br/>          seek a &quot;systematic&quot; approach) -- but not both at the same<br/>          time in a world without a theory of subtle temperament.</p><p>      (2) Like al-Sabbagh, as interpreted by Marcus, a theorist might<br/>          feel that 5-limit flavors, or a free choice at lots of<br/>          places between these flavors and Pythagoran ones (e.g. Mahur<br/>          versus a 5-limit Rast, or Buselik vs. Nihavend) is more<br/>          important than neutral flavors. Of course, with a<br/>          Pythagorean 29-MOS or larger, there are enough intervals of<br/>          all these flavors that the question of priorities becomes<br/>          less urgent. Even with a full circle of 52 pure fifths plus<br/>          one fifth at 3,615 cents narrow, of course, the variety of<br/>          neutral flavors will be less than in the 79-MOS -- but that<br/>          little 53-comma adds at least a bit of variety beyond the<br/>          two sizes for each category (e.g. 6 or 7 commas for a middle<br/>          second) in 53-EDO. It&apos;s quite possible to devise a 24-note<br/>          Pythagorean system with _lots_ of neutral flavors, but not a<br/>          regular one: two 12-MOS chains at 3 commas apart will do it<br/>          just fine! That&apos;s another story, however.</p><p>          Getting back to Urmavi and the 17-note system, maybe he<br/>          liked the elegant way that a Pythagorean 17-MOS could yield<br/>          _some_ of his favorite flavors, evidently including a<br/>          5-limit Rast much like that favored in Turkey today. The<br/>          17-MOS would be a neat theoretical model yielding some quite<br/>          beautiful tunings; and people could turn to his discussion<br/>          on middle intervals and tetrachords, and the tuning<br/>          practices involving neutral intervals which doubtless<br/>          prevailed, to enjoy what this 17-MOS didn&apos;t cover. I can<br/>          easily imagine someone looking at his theoretical 17-MOS<br/>          maqamat and intoning them so that 8192/6561 (~5/4) becomes<br/>          something like 27/22 or 21/17 or 26/21, etc. This kind of<br/>          thing is still happening today, as I know from reading Owen<br/>          Wright and &quot;adapting&quot; some tunings to a certain style of<br/>          temperament -- not to mention our conversations.</p><p>      (3) Flexible-pitch performers aren&apos;t bound by fixed systems,<br/>          small or otherwise; and people tuning the &grave;ud or tar or<br/>          whatever might tend to follow less &quot;systematic&quot; methods and<br/>          wind up with lots more neutral flavors, a la Zalzal, Ibn<br/>          Sina, etc. European theory has its &quot;academic&quot; tuning systems<br/>          also, which may tell us more about concepts and mathematical<br/>          tools than about prevalent tunings. Thus Ramos (1482) gives<br/>          a 5-limit JI tuning with a prominent Wolf fifth -- but also,<br/>          less often noted, describes a practical keyboard, as<br/>          chronicled by Mark Lindley, which seems very much in some<br/>          kind of meantone temperament (Ab-C#). In 1518, Henricus<br/>          Grammateus described a modification of Pythagorean tuning in<br/>          which accidentals divide a 9:8 tone into two equal semitones<br/>          (~101.955 cents or so) -- but by this point it is very<br/>          likely that some kind of meantone, regular or modified, was<br/>          the rule (as in Schlick, 1511, and Aaron, 1523).</p><p>          This doesn&apos;t mean that we should ignore &quot;academic&quot; tunings,<br/>          or ignore what theorists say, especially when urged to do so<br/>          by people less familiar with a given style. Thus Urmavi&apos;s<br/>          17-MOS could point to a great interest in schismatic thirds<br/>          and related intervals (he mentions 5:4, 6:5, and 7:6 as<br/>          having a considerable degree of concord), as well as a taste<br/>          for regularity in getting an unbroken chain of fifths.<br/>          Likewise the 5-limit monochord of Ramos, as well as his<br/>          likely description of a meantone keyboard, signal a move<br/>          toward a 5-limit aesthetic and away from the earlier vibrant<br/>          tradition of the 13th-14th centuries based on the regular<br/>          intervals of Pythagorean tuning, and its accentuated<br/>          variations for flexible pitch performances (Marchettus).<br/>          The modified Pythagorean system of Grammateus reflects a<br/>          great interest in the art of temperament and irrational<br/>          geometric divisions, with systems for calculating 12-EDO on<br/>          the lute (taken as standard by around the middle of the<br/>          century), and ultimately 17th-century and later theory based<br/>          on logarithms, as descendants of this line of inquiry.</p><p>      (4) Is it possible that different tunings might have been<br/>          preferred for different instruments, at least in widespread<br/>          practice and/or theory? In later 16th-century Europe, for<br/>          example, we often read that ensembles have tuning problems<br/>          because keyboards are customarily in meantone (say 1/5-1/3<br/>          comma, with varying tastes), lutes in 12-EDO, and singers<br/>          approximating 5-limit. While singers could adjust, the<br/>          harpsichord vs. lute issue might be more difficult. I&apos;m not<br/>          sure if there&apos;s any analogy in the world of Islamic<br/>          Civilization around the late 13th century -- just a stray<br/>          thought. Or, might people have often shifted between<br/>          different tunings, or maybe had two or three &grave;uds or the<br/>          like with different frettings, sort of like modern guitars<br/>          in 17-EDO or 19-EDO or 29-EDO or 31-EDO or whatever? If so,<br/>          maybe they could tune one instrument to Zalzal/al-Farabi or<br/>          the fine tuning of Urmavi you quote above: the &quot;Persian&quot;<br/>          neutral second at 162/149 would be quite close to the<br/>          smaller step of Zalzal/al-Farabi at 88:81 -- and another in<br/>          a Pythagorean 17-MOS or the like. On a flexible-pitch<br/>          instrument (maybe strings without frets?), you could take<br/>          both systems as models, and shift between them -- a wild<br/>          guess with any known basis? Could some instruments be<br/>          readily retuned to one system or another, like adjusting a<br/>          usual qanun to the maqam or family at use at a given time?</p><p>These are questions or points for discussion and argument, rather than<br/>&quot;solutions&quot; to your question.</p><p>Of course, there can be variety of constraints in tuning, and some<br/>decisions might be &quot;overdetermined&quot; in a way: for example, a medieval<br/>theorist might prefer a Pythagorean 17-MOS both because of a love for<br/>5-limit flavors and from a simple love for having pure and reliable<br/>fifths at every position but one in the gamut. One might also prefer<br/>it for regularity and the support for using usual diatonic intervals<br/>(1-6 generators) in lots of locations -- as with Prosdocimus and<br/>Ugolino in the early 15th century, who specifically want these usual<br/>sizes in directed progressions such as cadences rather than the<br/>schismatic sizes with major intervals a comma smaller and minor ones a<br/>comma larger (another story).</p><p>Similarly, a modern theorist might like a system with lots of support<br/>for a 5-limit version of Rast because of a special liking for that<br/>tuning, or an understanding that it is very prevalent and should be<br/>supported, or possibly also because of some ideological motivation to<br/>avoid more neutral flavors -- at least on paper! If a system like the<br/>79-MOS has pervasive support for neutral intervals also, we can<br/>discount the last motivation!</p><p>Interestingly, as possibly with Urmavi and the Pythagorean 17-MOS, a<br/>modern theorist might gravitate toward a 5-limit Rast as at least one<br/>main option because of a logic like this -- just an example of how<br/>people _might_ make decisions for various reasons in various eras:</p><p>             (1) Rast is the principal maqam, and it should be very<br/>                 easy to notate and play.</p><p>             (2) This means, in 20th-21st century conditions, that<br/>                 Rast should be defined by an unbroken chain of<br/>                 fifths, permitting regular spellings (i.e. a diatonic<br/>                 spelling of the basic disjunct form from rast to<br/>                 gerdaniye or C-C without accidentals).</p><p>             (3) However, they cannot all be Pythagorean fifths,<br/>                 because then we would have Mahur rather than Rast!</p><p>             (4) Further, if we assume that no fifth in the chain<br/>                 should be tempered by more than 7 cents or so (around<br/>                 1/3-comma, say a Holdrian comma in the 79-MOS or a<br/>                 full 159-EDO), this sets a lower limit on the size of<br/>                 the third, or the distance from rast to segah: no<br/>                 more than around 4/3 comma or two yarmans smaller<br/>                 than a Pythagorean 81/64, around 30 cents of<br/>                 narrowing -- and thus something like 378 cents (a tad<br/>                 less than the 379 cents of 19-EDO).</p><p>             (5) Using a neutral flavor of Rast instead will involve<br/>                 either breaking the chain of fifths (another option,<br/>                 of course, in the 79-MOS), or else tempering fifths<br/>                 at considerably more than 1/3-comma -- as in<br/>                 something like 26-EDO submajor range around 26/21. If<br/>                 we reasonably take around 1/3-comma as the limit of<br/>                 tasteful tempering for these purposes, then 5-limit<br/>                 indeed looks like the kind of Rast that fits a<br/>                 &quot;regular spellings with 1/3-comma or less of<br/>                 tempering&quot; agenda.</p><p>I&apos;m mentioning the modern Rast question not as any close analogy to<br/>Urmavi&apos;s possible reasons, but simply to suggest that there could be a<br/>variety of such reasons, maybe largely left unwritten and not so easy<br/>to discover some seven centuries later.</p><p>Yet your question is a call to a most noble and worthy endeavor or<br/>struggle to learn whatever we can, and to exercise our gift of reason<br/>in the great Mutazilah tradition.</p><p>WIth many thanks,</p><p>Margo</p></div><h3>Ozan Yarman &#x3C;ozanyarman@...&#x3E;</h3><span>9/19/2008 6:23:20 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Hello Aaron!</p><p>Where to start, where to start? There is a glossary section at the back of my thesis, but I gather you need a concise summary of the terms we use in maqam music. Ok. Here are some common terms that you may store at the tuning list cellar:</p><p>maqam/pl. maqamat or makamlar: A scale or collection of scales (sometimes exceeding an octave) with specific intervallic relationships between their degrees (called perdeler). They are likened to modes, but may also be defined as &quot;key&quot; with an emphasis on modality instead of tonality.</p><p>terkib/ pl. terkibat: Composite maqam (such as Kurdilihijazkar, Ferahfeza) or maqam with a suffix maqam attached (such as Saba-Zemzeme, Muhayyer-Kurdi, Beyati-Araban). A terkib is an agglomerate of two or more maqams, embroidered in a composition such that they come in a repeating pattern or sequence. The usage of the term is obsolete today.</p><p>perde/pl. perdeler or perdeha: Tone or pitch used by a maqam usually corresponding to a degree of 53 logarithmically equal divisions of the octave. The naming of the perdeler does not necessarily repeat at the octave (for example: rast-gerdaniye, dugah-muhayyer, segah-tiz segah). Some perdes, such as segah or hijaz (saba), are not always stationary and flaunt wide microtonal inflections depending on the maqam. The frequencies of perdeler depends on the ahenk chosen.</p><p>qarar or duraq: Finalis or tonic of a maqam or terkib.</p><p>asma qarar: Equivalent to dominant or sub-dominant in Western music. Asma qarar may sometimes be the third or other degree of the maqam&apos;s principal scale.</p><p>gechki: Modulation to another maqam.</p><p>cheshni: Savour, or borrowing from another maqam which is usually compatible with the maqam performed.</p><p>shedd: Transposition. Shedd maqam is a transposed maqam or the segment of a maqam which is transposed over to a perde other than its original finalis.</p><p>basqi/pl. basqilar: Intonation. Correct execution of a pitch.</p><p>ijra: Performance by a maqam music ensemble.</p><p>edvar (pl. of devir): Scales not exceeding an octave (named Ushshaq, Neva, Ebuselik, Rast, Hijaz, Nawruz, etc...) and written in Abjad notation in Medieval Islamic music treatises (most famous are those by Safi al-din Urmavi and Abdulqadir Maragi) comprising 17 (Pythagorean) tones to the octave (up 4 fifths, down 12 fifth from tone of origin); the treatises themselves.</p><p>ika: Meter.</p><p>usul/pl. usuller: Rhythm with a simple or composite pattern of beats.</p><p>aralik/pl. araliklar: Interval.</p><p>ahenk: Diapason, reference pitch. There are, in theory, 12 possible ahenks, each corresponding to a specific size of ney reed. The most famous ahenks from which ijra is executed are Bolahenk (rast on D), Supurde (rast on C), Mustahsen (rast on B), Kiz (rast on A), Mansur (rast on G) and Shah (rast on F).</p><p>jins/pl. ajnas: Divisions of the tetrachord or pentachord.</p><p>beshli: The interval of a fifth or pentachord.</p><p>dortlu: The interval of a fourth or tetrachord.</p><p>Ask me and I will give more definitions.</p><p>Cordially,<br/>Oz.</p><p>On Sep 18, 2008, at 6:14 PM, Aaron Krister Johnson wrote:</p><p>&gt; Hey Ozan and Margo,<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; This seems like an interesting discussion between you two, but I must<br/>&gt; admit my utter ignorance of most of these Arabic names and theory.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Perhaps a glossary of Arabic and Persian musical terms put up in the<br/>&gt; files section for tuning listers would help?

Here this tuning &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; is<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; given as realized in 1024-EDO, a standard for some synthesizers,<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; where the average size of the 23 fifths is about 704.603 cents.<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; That is a fine happenstance!<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt; Yes, I was pleasantly surprised that the fit should be so close. &gt;&gt;&gt; There<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt; are 17 fifths at 704.297 cents, and 6 fifths at 705.469 cents. The<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt; wider fifths are at Eb-Bb, G-D, and B-F# on each keyboard.<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Incidentally, the Turkish term _perde_ or &quot;note, pitch&quot; (plural<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; perdeler) might possibly be related, I might guess, to the Persian<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; _pardeh_, which can have a similar meaning and more specifically<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; signify the &quot;fret&quot; of an instrument.<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; But we use perde not just for note or pitch, but also to indicate<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; frets in Turkiye. The usage is the same for all Middle Eastern<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; nations.<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt; Thank you for educating me on this: maybe, like the origins of &gt;&gt;&gt; some of<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt; the maqamat, it might be an interesting question what language this<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt; term originated in. In reading Arab theory in English, so far, I&apos;m &gt;&gt;&gt; not<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt; sure if I&apos;ve seen any related term: but perde and pardeh seem &gt;&gt;&gt; common.<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt; They are one and the same. The word originates in Persian as far as I<br/>&gt;&gt; know.<br/>&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; In naming the perdeler, I have tried to be guided both by Arab and<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Turkish practice, and specifically by some of your conventions as<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; they might apply to a system with fewer alternatives than the<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; 79-MOS. When in doubt, I have taken the forms of Maqam Rast (as<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; realized in this temperament) as normative: that is, in placing<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; segah and evc or evdj (Arab awj) at 363 and 1068 cents, and hisar<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; at 859 cents for the sixth degree of Ajemli or Nirz Rast.<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Nirz Rast? Where does that name come from?<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt; Evidently the name Nirz Rast in Arab theory is another term for a<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt; maqam also called Nairuz, an Arabic version of the name for the &gt;&gt;&gt; Iranic<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt; New Year festival, with Nirz shortened from Nairuz. I also sometimes<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt; call it Zalzalian Rast; Ajemli Rast is very descriptive. In &gt;&gt;&gt; commas, I<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt; think of this as approximately 976|976|9, with the two conjuct Rast<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt; tetrachords. Of course, there are various ajnas to be found, and &gt;&gt;&gt; some<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt; Arab theorists may view it, for example, as disjunct Rast plus &gt;&gt;&gt; what is<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt; called Bayyati (i.e. Ushshaq), 976-9-769, although I would say that<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt; the upper 769 might be more like Huseyni than like the Arab &gt;&gt;&gt; version of<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt; Ushshaq or &quot;Bayyati,&quot; which 679 would better express.<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt; For those who did not follow the previous posts, let me clarify that<br/>&gt;&gt; ajnas are the plural of jins, which stands for genus and signifies &gt;&gt; the<br/>&gt;&gt; divisions of the tetrachord in medieval Islamic music theory. Since<br/>&gt;&gt; the late 19th Century, the term is applied to the divisions of<br/>&gt;&gt; pentachords too. I had at one point thought that ajnas could only be<br/>&gt;&gt; considered divisions of the tetrachord, but it occurred to me maqams<br/>&gt;&gt; such as Penchgah, Nihavend, Huseyni, Saba and even Huzzam require<br/>&gt;&gt; pentachords  to explain their scales in a wholesome manner.<br/>&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt; As for Nawruz, Abdulbaki Nasir Dede gives a detailed description &gt;&gt; which<br/>&gt;&gt; I interpret as follows:<br/>&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt; 1. An ascending-descending Nihavend pentachord from perde neva to<br/>&gt;&gt; muhayyer, G-A-Bb-c-d<br/>&gt;&gt; 2. A Mahur tetrachord from perde chargah to perde ajem, F-G-A-Bb<br/>&gt;&gt; 3. A possible Mahur tetrachord from perde ajem to perde sunbule, Bb-&gt;&gt; c-<br/>&gt;&gt; d-eb<br/>&gt;&gt; 4. Finalis on ajem, Bb<br/>&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt; There are also Nawruz-i Ajem and Nawruz-i Sultani in Nasir Dede&apos;s<br/>&gt;&gt; treatise Tedkik u Tahkik. The latter is defined as a Nawruz-i Ajem<br/>&gt;&gt; that makes a Rast cadence. Nasir Dede says he gave the name himself &gt;&gt; as<br/>&gt;&gt; tribute to his patron Sultan Selim III. Nawruz-i Ajem, as the name<br/>&gt;&gt; implies, a Nawruz that concludes with Ajem. Ajem, according to Nasir<br/>&gt;&gt; Dede, is:<br/>&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt; c-Bb-A-Ab-G-F-Ed-D<br/>&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt; Accordingly, Nawruz-i Sultani becomes:<br/>&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt; eb-d-c-Bb: Mahur on ajem<br/>&gt;&gt; c-Bb-Ab-G-F: Nihavend on chargah<br/>&gt;&gt; F-Ed-D-C: Rast on rast<br/>&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt; Still, no sign of Huseini or Bayyati/Ushshaq on the upper conjunct<br/>&gt;&gt; pentachord.<br/>&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; An interesting feature is that perde buselik is at an almost just<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; 14/11, or about 18.5 Holdrian commas, sometimes suggested as a<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; preferred location by certain Near Eastern theorists.<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt;  [Excerpt from my table of perdeler or steps, which I&apos;ve trimmed]<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; ---------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; 8     C     363.281     21/17      Segah              24   362.215<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; ---------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; 18     F     858.984     23/14      Hisar              56   852,878<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;                                                       57   867.970<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; ---------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; So far so good.<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt; Our discussions since I made this table, however, raise one point,<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt; since 859 cents is the perfect fourth of segah at 363 cents, might &gt;&gt;&gt; it<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt; better be named dik hisar (&quot;steep Hisar&quot;), and 837 cents be &gt;&gt;&gt; considered<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt; simply hisar?

But I hear the term Nirz Rast for the<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; first time.<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt; Thank you for your feedback: as I suggested in another message, this<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt; may be a bit like learning a language, and having the good fortune &gt;&gt;&gt; to<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt; have a teacher who is not only an excellent native speaker, but a<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt; leading scholar of its syntax and grammar!<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt; There is a good question how widespread the term Nirz Rast is in the<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt; Arab world: I have seen it, for example, in a dissertation by Scott<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt; Marcus on _Arab Music Theory in the Modern Period_, where Yusuf &gt;&gt;&gt; Shawqi<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt; (1964) is one source for this name. Some other sources of Arab &gt;&gt;&gt; theory<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt; prefer Nairuz, for example<br/>&gt; &lt;<a href="http://www.maqamworld.com/maqamat/rast.html">http://www.maqamworld.com/maqamat/rast.html</a><br/>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; .<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt; Interestingly, d&apos;Erlanger has two spellings, Nairuz or Niriz, with &gt;&gt;&gt; the<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt; latter close to Nirz. While al-Sabbagh, as cited by Marcus, calls &gt;&gt;&gt; the<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt; maqam simmply Nirz, some others have Nirz Rast.<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt; That is a perversion. Nawruz can be likened to this modulation in<br/>&gt;&gt; Western music:<br/>&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt; G minor =&gt; F Major =&gt; Bb Major =&gt; Eb Major =&gt; Bb Major.<br/>&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Maqam Nihavend (supraminor flavor)<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;                 Ascending<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;     Nihavend      tone        Hijaz<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; |-----------------|......|-----------------|<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; F#    G#    A*    B      C#    D*     F    F#<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; 0     208  341   495    704   837   1068  1200<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; 208   132   154    210   132   231   132<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;                Descending<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;     Nihavend      tone        Segah<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; |-----------------|......|-----------------|<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; F#    G#    A*    B      C#    D*    E*    F#<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; 0     208  341   495    704   837   1045  1200<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; 208   132   154    210   132   208   155<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; An acceptable Nihavend, save for E*, which I believe should be 9/8<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; lower from F#.<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt; Ah, this is easily corrected, and the upper tetrachord might now, &gt;&gt;&gt; if I<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt; am correct, be called Ushshaq -- if this is fitting for this maqam:<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt;                  Descending<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt;       Nihavend      tone       Ushshaq<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt; |-----------------|......|-----------------|<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt; F#    G#    A*    B      C#    D*    E    F#<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt; 0     208  341   495    704   837   991  1200<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt;   208   132   154    210   132   155   209<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt;         [...]<br/>&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt; But I see that this is not acceptable. The third and sixth degrees<br/>&gt;&gt; must also be lowered by a diesis each. Nihavend and Buselik appear to<br/>&gt;&gt; be the same in your tuning.<br/>&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; 155 cents is not appropriate as an interval between E* and F# for<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; the descending scale of Nihavend I&apos;m afraid.<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt; Here I may have made my mistake through a desire to have a perfect<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt; fifth between the third and seventh degrees (A*-E*); but now I<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt; understand that the seventh degree in the descending form should &gt;&gt;&gt; be a<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt; 9:8 below the octave of the final or tonic, with a perfect fourth<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt; between the fourth and seventh degrees. Thus, in a supraminor &gt;&gt;&gt; flavor,<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt; something like 967-9-679, but with the smaller neutral second at 132<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt; cents a tad smaller than 6 full commas.<br/>&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt; On second thought, this rendition somewhat resembles Nihavend, though<br/>&gt;&gt; is not fully Nihavend!<br/>&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Here the supraminor third of Nihavend differs from the regular<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; minor third of Buselik by a diesis or about 55 cents (286 and 341<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; cents), as does the submajor third of Rast from the regular major<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; third of Mahur (363 and 418 cents). However, the thirds of &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Nihavend<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; and Rast differ by only a comma (341 and 363 cents), the fine<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; difference between supraminor and submajor (or roughly 15 and 16<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; commas).<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; This is very much agreeable.<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt; Again, your guidance is welcome, and the rule of a descending &gt;&gt;&gt; version<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt; with the seventh degree at 16/9 nicely resolves my uncertainty.<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Oz.<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt; With many thanks,<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt; Margo<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt; Cordially,<br/>&gt;&gt; Oz.<br/>&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; ------------------------------------<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; You can configure your subscription by sending an empty email to one<br/>&gt; of these addresses (from the address at which you receive the list):<br/>&gt;  <a href="mailto:tuning-subscribe@yahoogroups.com">tuning-subscribe@yahoogroups.com</a> - join the tuning group.<br/>&gt;  <a href="mailto:tuning-unsubscribe@yahoogroups.com">tuning-unsubscribe@yahoogroups.com</a> - leave the group.<br/>&gt;  <a href="mailto:tuning-nomail@yahoogroups.com">tuning-nomail@yahoogroups.com</a> - turn off mail from the group.<br/>&gt;  <a href="mailto:tuning-digest@yahoogroups.com">tuning-digest@yahoogroups.com</a> - set group to send daily digests.<br/>&gt;  <a href="mailto:tuning-normal@yahoogroups.com">tuning-normal@yahoogroups.com</a> - set group to send individual emails.<br/>&gt;  <a href="mailto:tuning-help@yahoogroups.com">tuning-help@yahoogroups.com</a> - receive general help information.<br/>&gt; Yahoo!

Here this tuning &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; is<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; given as realized in 1024-EDO, a standard for some synthesizers,<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; where the average size of the 23 fifths is about 704.603 cents.<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; That is a fine happenstance!<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt; Yes, I was pleasantly surprised that the fit should be so close. &gt;&gt;&gt; There<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt; are 17 fifths at 704.297 cents, and 6 fifths at 705.469 cents. The<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt; wider fifths are at Eb-Bb, G-D, and B-F# on each keyboard.<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Incidentally, the Turkish term _perde_ or &quot;note, pitch&quot; (plural<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; perdeler) might possibly be related, I might guess, to the Persian<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; _pardeh_, which can have a similar meaning and more specifically<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; signify the &quot;fret&quot; of an instrument.<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; But we use perde not just for note or pitch, but also to indicate<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; frets in Turkiye. The usage is the same for all Middle Eastern<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; nations.<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt; Thank you for educating me on this: maybe, like the origins of &gt;&gt;&gt; some of<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt; the maqamat, it might be an interesting question what language this<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt; term originated in. In reading Arab theory in English, so far, I&apos;m &gt;&gt;&gt; not<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt; sure if I&apos;ve seen any related term: but perde and pardeh seem &gt;&gt;&gt; common.<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt; They are one and the same. The word originates in Persian as far as I<br/>&gt;&gt; know.<br/>&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; In naming the perdeler, I have tried to be guided both by Arab and<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Turkish practice, and specifically by some of your conventions as<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; they might apply to a system with fewer alternatives than the<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; 79-MOS. When in doubt, I have taken the forms of Maqam Rast (as<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; realized in this temperament) as normative: that is, in placing<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; segah and evc or evdj (Arab awj) at 363 and 1068 cents, and hisar<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; at 859 cents for the sixth degree of Ajemli or Nirz Rast.<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Nirz Rast? Where does that name come from?<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt; Evidently the name Nirz Rast in Arab theory is another term for a<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt; maqam also called Nairuz, an Arabic version of the name for the &gt;&gt;&gt; Iranic<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt; New Year festival, with Nirz shortened from Nairuz. I also sometimes<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt; call it Zalzalian Rast; Ajemli Rast is very descriptive. In &gt;&gt;&gt; commas, I<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt; think of this as approximately 976|976|9, with the two conjuct Rast<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt; tetrachords. Of course, there are various ajnas to be found, and &gt;&gt;&gt; some<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt; Arab theorists may view it, for example, as disjunct Rast plus &gt;&gt;&gt; what is<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt; called Bayyati (i.e. Ushshaq), 976-9-769, although I would say that<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt; the upper 769 might be more like Huseyni than like the Arab &gt;&gt;&gt; version of<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt; Ushshaq or &quot;Bayyati,&quot; which 679 would better express.<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt; For those who did not follow the previous posts, let me clarify that<br/>&gt;&gt; ajnas are the plural of jins, which stands for genus and signifies &gt;&gt; the<br/>&gt;&gt; divisions of the tetrachord in medieval Islamic music theory. Since<br/>&gt;&gt; the late 19th Century, the term is applied to the divisions of<br/>&gt;&gt; pentachords too. I had at one point thought that ajnas could only be<br/>&gt;&gt; considered divisions of the tetrachord, but it occurred to me maqams<br/>&gt;&gt; such as Penchgah, Nihavend, Huseyni, Saba and even Huzzam require<br/>&gt;&gt; pentachords  to explain their scales in a wholesome manner.<br/>&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt; As for Nawruz, Abdulbaki Nasir Dede gives a detailed description &gt;&gt; which<br/>&gt;&gt; I interpret as follows:<br/>&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt; 1. An ascending-descending Nihavend pentachord from perde neva to<br/>&gt;&gt; muhayyer, G-A-Bb-c-d<br/>&gt;&gt; 2. A Mahur tetrachord from perde chargah to perde ajem, F-G-A-Bb<br/>&gt;&gt; 3. A possible Mahur tetrachord from perde ajem to perde sunbule, Bb-&gt;&gt; c-<br/>&gt;&gt; d-eb<br/>&gt;&gt; 4. Finalis on ajem, Bb<br/>&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt; There are also Nawruz-i Ajem and Nawruz-i Sultani in Nasir Dede&apos;s<br/>&gt;&gt; treatise Tedkik u Tahkik. The latter is defined as a Nawruz-i Ajem<br/>&gt;&gt; that makes a Rast cadence. Nasir Dede says he gave the name himself &gt;&gt; as<br/>&gt;&gt; tribute to his patron Sultan Selim III. Nawruz-i Ajem, as the name<br/>&gt;&gt; implies, a Nawruz that concludes with Ajem. Ajem, according to Nasir<br/>&gt;&gt; Dede, is:<br/>&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt; c-Bb-A-Ab-G-F-Ed-D<br/>&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt; Accordingly, Nawruz-i Sultani becomes:<br/>&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt; eb-d-c-Bb: Mahur on ajem<br/>&gt;&gt; c-Bb-Ab-G-F: Nihavend on chargah<br/>&gt;&gt; F-Ed-D-C: Rast on rast<br/>&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt; Still, no sign of Huseini or Bayyati/Ushshaq on the upper conjunct<br/>&gt;&gt; pentachord.<br/>&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; An interesting feature is that perde buselik is at an almost just<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; 14/11, or about 18.5 Holdrian commas, sometimes suggested as a<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; preferred location by certain Near Eastern theorists.<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt;  [Excerpt from my table of perdeler or steps, which I&apos;ve trimmed]<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; ---------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; 8     C     363.281     21/17      Segah              24   362.215<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; ---------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; 18     F     858.984     23/14      Hisar              56   852,878<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;                                                       57   867.970<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; ---------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; So far so good.<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt; Our discussions since I made this table, however, raise one point,<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt; since 859 cents is the perfect fourth of segah at 363 cents, might &gt;&gt;&gt; it<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt; better be named dik hisar (&quot;steep Hisar&quot;), and 837 cents be &gt;&gt;&gt; considered<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt; simply hisar?

But I hear the term Nirz Rast for the<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; first time.<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt; Thank you for your feedback: as I suggested in another message, this<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt; may be a bit like learning a language, and having the good fortune &gt;&gt;&gt; to<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt; have a teacher who is not only an excellent native speaker, but a<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt; leading scholar of its syntax and grammar!<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt; There is a good question how widespread the term Nirz Rast is in the<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt; Arab world: I have seen it, for example, in a dissertation by Scott<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt; Marcus on _Arab Music Theory in the Modern Period_, where Yusuf &gt;&gt;&gt; Shawqi<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt; (1964) is one source for this name. Some other sources of Arab &gt;&gt;&gt; theory<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt; prefer Nairuz, for example<br/>&gt; &lt;<a href="http://www.maqamworld.com/maqamat/rast.html">http://www.maqamworld.com/maqamat/rast.html</a><br/>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; .<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt; Interestingly, d&apos;Erlanger has two spellings, Nairuz or Niriz, with &gt;&gt;&gt; the<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt; latter close to Nirz. While al-Sabbagh, as cited by Marcus, calls &gt;&gt;&gt; the<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt; maqam simmply Nirz, some others have Nirz Rast.<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt; That is a perversion. Nawruz can be likened to this modulation in<br/>&gt;&gt; Western music:<br/>&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt; G minor =&gt; F Major =&gt; Bb Major =&gt; Eb Major =&gt; Bb Major.<br/>&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Maqam Nihavend (supraminor flavor)<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;                 Ascending<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;     Nihavend      tone        Hijaz<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; |-----------------|......|-----------------|<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; F#    G#    A*    B      C#    D*     F    F#<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; 0     208  341   495    704   837   1068  1200<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; 208   132   154    210   132   231   132<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;                Descending<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;     Nihavend      tone        Segah<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; |-----------------|......|-----------------|<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; F#    G#    A*    B      C#    D*    E*    F#<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; 0     208  341   495    704   837   1045  1200<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; 208   132   154    210   132   208   155<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; An acceptable Nihavend, save for E*, which I believe should be 9/8<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; lower from F#.<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt; Ah, this is easily corrected, and the upper tetrachord might now, &gt;&gt;&gt; if I<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt; am correct, be called Ushshaq -- if this is fitting for this maqam:<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt;                  Descending<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt;       Nihavend      tone       Ushshaq<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt; |-----------------|......|-----------------|<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt; F#    G#    A*    B      C#    D*    E    F#<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt; 0     208  341   495    704   837   991  1200<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt;   208   132   154    210   132   155   209<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt;         [...]<br/>&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt; But I see that this is not acceptable. The third and sixth degrees<br/>&gt;&gt; must also be lowered by a diesis each. Nihavend and Buselik appear to<br/>&gt;&gt; be the same in your tuning.<br/>&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; 155 cents is not appropriate as an interval between E* and F# for<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; the descending scale of Nihavend I&apos;m afraid.<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt; Here I may have made my mistake through a desire to have a perfect<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt; fifth between the third and seventh degrees (A*-E*); but now I<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt; understand that the seventh degree in the descending form should &gt;&gt;&gt; be a<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt; 9:8 below the octave of the final or tonic, with a perfect fourth<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt; between the fourth and seventh degrees. Thus, in a supraminor &gt;&gt;&gt; flavor,<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt; something like 967-9-679, but with the smaller neutral second at 132<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt; cents a tad smaller than 6 full commas.<br/>&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt; On second thought, this rendition somewhat resembles Nihavend, though<br/>&gt;&gt; is not fully Nihavend!<br/>&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Here the supraminor third of Nihavend differs from the regular<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; minor third of Buselik by a diesis or about 55 cents (286 and 341<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; cents), as does the submajor third of Rast from the regular major<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; third of Mahur (363 and 418 cents). However, the thirds of &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Nihavend<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; and Rast differ by only a comma (341 and 363 cents), the fine<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; difference between supraminor and submajor (or roughly 15 and 16<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; commas).<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; This is very much agreeable.<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt; Again, your guidance is welcome, and the rule of a descending &gt;&gt;&gt; version<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt; with the seventh degree at 16/9 nicely resolves my uncertainty.<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Oz.<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt; With many thanks,<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt; Margo<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt; Cordially,<br/>&gt;&gt; Oz.<br/>&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; ------------------------------------<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; You can configure your subscription by sending an empty email to one<br/>&gt; of these addresses (from the address at which you receive the list):<br/>&gt;  <a href="mailto:tuning-subscribe@yahoogroups.com">tuning-subscribe@yahoogroups.com</a> - join the tuning group.<br/>&gt;  <a href="mailto:tuning-unsubscribe@yahoogroups.com">tuning-unsubscribe@yahoogroups.com</a> - leave the group.<br/>&gt;  <a href="mailto:tuning-nomail@yahoogroups.com">tuning-nomail@yahoogroups.com</a> - turn off mail from the group.<br/>&gt;  <a href="mailto:tuning-digest@yahoogroups.com">tuning-digest@yahoogroups.com</a> - set group to send daily digests.<br/>&gt;  <a href="mailto:tuning-normal@yahoogroups.com">tuning-normal@yahoogroups.com</a> - set group to send individual emails.<br/>&gt;  <a href="mailto:tuning-help@yahoogroups.com">tuning-help@yahoogroups.com</a> - receive general help information.<br/>&gt; Yahoo!

The scheme suggested here borrows extensively<br/>from recent Turkish usage, while seeking to remedy such anomalies as<br/>the frequent omission of neutral second steps because of ideological<br/>factors, specifically a political dislike for associating the Turkish<br/>heritage of maqam music with &quot;Arab&quot; and &quot;Byzantine&quot; systems featuring<br/>the use of &quot;quartertones.&quot; Your dissertation, Ozan, of course covers<br/>all of this history and more in great detail, a fascinating education<br/>for me and others who read it.</p><p>Aaron, and others who may be new to this, I should explain that Near<br/>Eastern theory offers various degrees of &quot;resolution&quot; or specificity<br/>in defining the types or sizes of intervals that are -- or in the<br/>writer&apos;s view should be -- used in the intonation of a given<br/>tetrachord, maqam, etc.</p><p>A &quot;low resolution&quot; system says basically: &quot;This step is or should be a<br/>tone, semitone, neutral second, or an &quot;augmented step&quot; or<br/>&quot;plus-second&quot; often equal to some kind of minor third ranging from<br/>septimal or slightly smaller up to around Pythagorean.&quot;</p><p>For example, consider a typical Arab form of a tetrachord or _jins_<br/>(from the Greek _genus_) named Rast, also the name of a maqam or modal<br/>complex drawing its basic steps from two of these tetrachords. Here&apos;s<br/>a low-resolution notation for this variety of Rast using an<br/>approximate quartertone system (common in 19th-21st century Arab<br/>theory) or an approximate thirdtone system. Note that &quot;d&quot; represents a<br/>half-flat symbol used to show an _approximate_ quartertone alteration,<br/>but not necessarily one of precisely 50 cents as in 24-EDO!</p><p>          C     D    Ed    F<br/>24:       0     4    7    10<br/>             4    3    3</p><p>17:       0     3    5    7<br/>             3    2    2</p><p>Describing Rast as 4-3-3 in the 24-step system or 3-2-2 in the 17-step<br/>system is a very useful shorthand, but leaves open, for example, just<br/>how the neutral third of the tetrachord should be placed, and which of<br/>the two neutral second steps, the first or the second, should be<br/>larger or smaller. These issues wouldn&apos;t come up in 17-EDO or 24-EDO,<br/>where there is only one size of neutral second step -- but will come<br/>in traditional performances of Near Eastern music, where there are<br/>almost infinite shadings of these steps and playing &quot;in tune&quot; involves<br/>an appreciation of this.</p><p>A 53-comma notation, or the letter notation of the Persian theorist<br/>Hormoz Farhat, addresses these vital questions but still leaves lots<br/>of room for &quot;fine-tuning,&quot; or for the vagaries of different JI or<br/>tempered systems. Here&apos;s a middle-level description of Rast in both<br/>these systems:</p><p>53:        C      D     Ed    F<br/>           0      9     16   22<br/>              9      7     6</p><p>Farhat:       M      N     n</p><p>Just as the 17-step and 24-step notations don&apos;t necessarily imply<br/>using 17-EDO or 24-EDO, so the 53-step or 53-comma system doesn&apos;t<br/>necessarily imply 53-EDO or Pythagorean: rather it provides a handy<br/>numerical shorthand that can be adapted to various tuning systems, or<br/>to flexible-pitch performance (often the main focus!). Farhat&apos;s system<br/>uses letters to show a (M)ajor second, large (N)eutral or small<br/>(n)eutral step, or (m)inor second step -- the last not used in Rast.</p><p>Read literally in 53-EDO terms, the 9-7-6 notation would call for<br/>steps of 204-158-136 cents -- a very pleasant tuning, in fact, but<br/>only one of many possibilities fitting the spirit of this or Farhat&apos;s<br/>M-N-n notation.</p><p>The important point is that we are told not only that this version of<br/>Rast has a lower tone plus two neutral seconds, but that the lower<br/>neutral second is the larger one.</p><p>The 53-comma system is also very useful in distinguishing this flavor<br/>of Rast, the usual one in Arab theory, with a different flavor known<br/>in medieval and modern times, and the one taken as the standard model,<br/>so to speak, in modern Turkey:</p><p>53:        C      D      E    F<br/>           0      9     17   22<br/>              9      8     5</p><p>This is a 5-limit flavor of Rast, as shown by the 53-comma notation.<br/>Interestingly, as in your 79-MOS, Ozan, this tuning might actually be<br/>realized by a single unbroken chain of fifths with at least some of<br/>these generators tempered, as in a European meantone. What 9-8-5<br/>notation shows us is the 5-limit pattern, in contrast to 9-7-6 with<br/>its use of two neutral seconds and a largish neutral third rather than<br/>a 5:4 major third.</p><p>A &quot;high-resolution&quot; notation, of course, could use cents; or JI<br/>ratios; or steps smaller than a 53-comma, as with the 79-MOS, where<br/>the usual unit is the yarman, equal to about 2/3 of a comma or about<br/>15.09 cents. Indeed, thinking of yarmans as &quot;just a tad larger than<br/>15 cents&quot; is a great shortcut for keeping track of them! That,<br/>however, is another topic and another post.</p><p>Getting back to the 53-comma system, I should explain that the table<br/>below isn&apos;t meant to cover all intervals, but those either likely to<br/>be used as basic steps in maqam and dastgah music, or smaller than<br/>these usual steps but important for measuring certain inflections or<br/>differences in size: the comma itself, and the 2-comma category, which<br/>could be called a demi-limma, half-limma, or medieval diaschisma (not<br/>to be confused with another use of this last term for a smaller<br/>interval of 2048:2025 or about 19.55 cents).</p><p>One general set of categories might invite a quick explanation: the<br/>&quot;augmented&quot; step or &quot;plus-second&quot; ranging from a bit larger than 8:7<br/>up through 15:13 (11 commas) and the 7:6 minor third (12 commas) up to<br/>around a Pythagorean minor third (13 commas). This is the middle step<br/>of a tetrachord type known as Hijaz, and also in the Persian tradition<br/>as Chahargah (or Turkish Chargah). One tradition style of tuning for<br/>Hijaz might be about as follows:</p><p>              D    Ed     F#   G<br/>cents         0    140   408  498<br/>               140    268   90</p><p>53-commas     0    6     18   22<br/>                6     12    4</p><p>To show how the 53-comma system might be adapted to a temperament,<br/>categories corresponding to the Pythagorean of 53-EDO ones are shown<br/>for a regular temperament known as the &quot;e-based&quot; tuning since the<br/>ratio between the regular tone and diatonic semitone or limma is equal<br/>to Euler&apos;s e, around 2.71828 -- thus a fifth around 704.607 cents.<br/>The categories often map reasonably well, although the chains of<br/>generators are often different -- thus the Pythagorean or 53-EDO<br/>12-comma at around 23 cents matches up with the e-based 17-comma at<br/>around 22 cents.</p><p>----------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>       Middle-resolution categories based on 53-comma system<br/>----------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>53-EDO type    commas  cents  symbol   e-based type  53-commas  cents<br/>----------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>12-comma         1     22.64     F     17-comma        0.96     21.68<br/>......................................................................<br/>demi-limma       2     45.28     D     --------       -----     -----<br/>......................................................................<br/>reduced limma    3     67.92     E     12-diesis       2.44     55.28<br/>----------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>limma            4     90.57     B     limma           3.40     76.97<br/>----------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>apotome          5    113.21     S     limma + comma   4.36     98.65<br/>......................................................................<br/>small neut 2nd   6    135.85     Js    apotome         5.84    132.25<br/>......................................................................<br/>large neut 2nd   7    158.49     Jk    dim 3rd         6.80    153.93<br/>......................................................................<br/>dim 3rd          8    181.13     K     reduced tone    8.28    187.53<br/>----------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>tone             9    203.77     T     tone            9.24    209.21<br/>......................................................................<br/>large tone      10    226.42     T10   large tone     10.20    230.90<br/>----------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>hemifourth      11    249.06     A11   ----------     -----    ------<br/>......................................................................<br/>small min 3rd   12    271.70     A12   small min 3rd  11.68    264.50<br/>......................................................................<br/>min 3rd         13    294.34     A13   min 3rd        12.64    286.18<br/>----------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p>Much more could be said about the history of some of these symbols in<br/>recent Turkish theory, and I&apos;d warmly invite you to add any helpful<br/>details or corrections, Ozan or anyone else.</p><p>With many thanks,</p><p>Margo</p></div><h3>Margo Schulter &#x3C;mschulter@...&#x3E;</h3><span>9/24/2008 7:35:06 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Dear Daniel Stearns and all,</p><p>Thank you for this fascinating document, and the<br/>sobering reminding of the violence and genocide that took<br/>place during the Second World War, tying in so tragically<br/>with the musical history you are chronicling. One reaction<br/>on my part is to think of Adriaan Fokker, who was fortunate<br/>enough to survive that war and occupation of the Netherlands;<br/>and his colleague in physics Lise Meitner, who left Germany<br/>just in time (1938) -- thus saving her life, but very<br/>possibly also contributing to the circumstances in which her<br/>colleagues rather than she received the Nobel Prize for their<br/>discovery as a team of nuclear fission.</p><p>Reading what I could understand by a crude process of looking for<br/>Latin-related words or cognates -- the PDF file ran fine, by<br/>the way -- showed a discussion of the 24-tone and 17-tone views<br/>of Arab music, and also use of the ultimately medieval European<br/>distinction between b (Bb) and h (B-natural) -- for example,<br/>e-f, b-c, and a-b as diatonic semitones.</p><p>What I try to imagine is what these different currents of world<br/>music might have seemed like to Haba in the interwar era, as we<br/>now think of it -- the &quot;postwar&quot; era, of course, as it seemed<br/>more optimistically at the time. It&apos;s fascinating that Haba cites<br/>a study of an 11th-century manuscript from Montpellier (not to be<br/>confused with the 13th-century collection of polyphony with which<br/>I&apos;m familiar) having signs which, it&apos;s been argued, might represent<br/>microtonal inflections.</p><p>Of course, today, there are still many current of world music: and<br/>I often wonder how my colleagues Ozan Yarman and Shaahin Mohaajeri<br/>may view the diversity in which we all participate. My background<br/>is mostly in medieval European music, a curious vantagepoint, but<br/>no more nor less valid than any other.</p><p>As to 24-EDO, I do have some comments. In my view, it&apos;s a beautiful<br/>tuning, but necessarily a limited one -- as any equal temperament<br/>of around this size will necessarily be, since an EDO, from one<br/>viewpoint, is a strategy for getting the smallest possible number<br/>of interval sizes in a given tuning size &lt;grin&gt;.</p><p>From a &quot;regional&quot; point of view, 24-EDO might be said to have three<br/>main categories or families of intervals, all useful, but, because<br/>of the modest size plus EDO structure, not as varied as may be<br/>required for some applications (hardly a unique &quot;flaw&quot;!).</p><p>Being able to describe in what I hope are reasonably objective terms<br/>the types or regions of intervals offered by a given tuning system<br/>seems to me a desirable goal for 21st-century theory. Let&apos;s quickly<br/>consider 24-EDO from this point of view.</p><p>The regular 12-EDO intervals, as with that smaller tuning, may be<br/>taken as a slightly &quot;subdued&quot; variation on 12-note Pythagorean<br/>intonation of a kind standard in medieval Europe, or as a rather<br/>inaccurate meantone temperament at the upper boundary of that tuning<br/>style. If the goal is simply to make a 12-note Pythagorean system into<br/>a circle, then in fact this is a fine solution, although the colors<br/>are a bit diluted -- in contrast to the modern strategy of tempering<br/>a comparable amount in the more &quot;interesting&quot; or wide direction for<br/>neomedieval music today.</p><p>As has been mentioned, 24-EDO has an excellent family of intervals in<br/>the central portion of the neutral range: thus 150 cents (12:11); 350<br/>cents (11:9 or 27:22); 850 cents (44:27 or 18:11); and 1050 cents (11:6).<br/>The main criticism here -- as with 17-EDO or 31-EDO -- is that we have<br/>only neutral size for each category, e.g. only one neutral second.<br/>In Near Eastern styles, the contrast between small and large neutral<br/>intervals is often a vital one, one of the reasons why the &quot;24-tone&quot;<br/>model of Arab music is simply that, a model, rather than a precise guide<br/>to intonation. However, there&apos;s lots of beautiful music that can be made<br/>with these 24-EDO neutral sizes -- and the related &quot;superfourth&quot; at<br/>550 cents, very close to 11:8.</p><p>A big attraction of 24-EDO is the set of what I term interseptimal<br/>intervals at 250, 450, 750, and 950 cents. These are one of the greatest<br/>charms of the tuning, in my view: &quot;interseptimal&quot; refers to the fact<br/>each of these ratios is located between landmark septimal ratios such<br/>as 8:7 and 7:6 (231-250-267 cents); 9:7 and 21:16 (435-450-471 cents);<br/>32:21 and 14:9 (729-750-765 cents); or 12:7 and 7:4 (933-950-969 cents).</p><p>These intervals are routine in Balinese or Javanese gamelan, for example,<br/>but &quot;revolutionary&quot; from a conventional European perspective since they<br/>seem about midway between two familiar categories such as &quot;major second&quot;<br/>and &quot;minor third.&quot; Indeed, following standard 14th-century European<br/>counterpoint patterns, 950 cents can nicely serve as either a wide major<br/>sixth expanding to an octave, or a narrow minor seventh contracting to a<br/>fifth. It&apos;s an interesting question whether more &quot;ebullient&quot;<br/>interpretations of the intonational precepts of Marchettus of Padua (1318)<br/>may have produced intervals in this region -- but, in any event, a fine<br/>harmonic resource for the 21st century.</p><p>The interseptimal intervals of 24-EDO could be compared to just ratios of<br/>15:13 or 22:19 (250 cents); 22:17 or 13:10 (450 cents); 20:13 or 17:11<br/>(750 cents); and 19:11 or 26:15 (950 cents).</p><p>A point to be emphasized is that from an historical European perspective,<br/>both the neutral and interseptimal families of 24-EDO represent &quot;the sound<br/>of the new&quot; -- although from a perspective of Near Eastern maqam/dastgah<br/>music or the custom-tuned ensembles of gamelan, the tuning might rather<br/>represent merely a quick sampler of the familiar, hopefully leading people<br/>coming from a European perspective who are intrigued by these sounds to<br/>look more deeply into these traditions where they have been in use for<br/>many centuries.</p><p>On a &quot;regional&quot; approach to intervals and ratios, see also:</p><p>   &lt;<a href="http://www.bestII.com/~mschulter/IntervalSpectrumRegions.txt">http://www.bestII.com/~mschulter/IntervalSpectrumRegions.txt</a>&gt;</p><p>Again, Daniel, you&apos;re an ideal person to present this Haba material in<br/>its fuller human and musical context -- thank you!</p><p>Thanks also to the others who have enriched this discussion. The mention<br/>of 15th-century &quot;atonality&quot; is of great interest to me, and I am curious<br/>to which pieces or style this label might apply (I am aware of hotly<br/>debated attempts, as by Edward Lowinsky, to use this terminology in<br/>a 16th-century or early 17th-century context, as with Gesualdo -- and<br/>the strongly differing views of Richard Crocker and Carl Dahlhaus, for<br/>example). Some of the very adventurous pieces such as Solage&apos;s _Fumeux<br/>fume_ in the era of 1380-1400 or so, or Guillaume (if I&apos;m correct)<br/>Legrant in the following generation, are indeed &quot;wayward,&quot; as one<br/>anthology puts it -- but I&apos;d say that elements of modality (in the free<br/>polyphonic sense) and cadential direction still supply a feeling of a<br/>&quot;finalis.&quot;</p><p>Most appreciatively,</p><p>Margo</p></div><h3>Daniel Forro &#x3C;dan.for@...&#x3E;</h3><span>9/25/2008 2:10:23 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Dear Margo Schulter,</p><p>thank you for your deep insight.</p><p>On 25 Sep 2008, at 11:35 AM, Margo Schulter wrote:<br/>&gt; Dear Daniel Stearns and all,<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Thank you for this fascinating document, and the<br/>&gt; sobering reminding of the violence and genocide that took<br/>&gt; place during the Second World War, tying in so tragically<br/>&gt; with the musical history you are chronicling.

We can now listen, study and get scores to any music, one can find inspiration anywhere and connect everything with everything. Which I do as well in my music, prefering to make an organic synthesis, not just mix of styles. Open minded people like Haba are happy with such possibilities.<br/>&gt; It&apos;s fascinating that Haba cites<br/>&gt; a study of an 11th-century manuscript from Montpellier (not to be<br/>&gt; confused with the 13th-century collection of polyphony with which<br/>&gt; I&apos;m familiar) having signs which, it&apos;s been argued, might represent<br/>&gt; microtonal inflections.<br/>&gt;<br/>He mentioned it&apos;s considered to be quartertones.<br/>But concerning microintervals he totally omitted Antonin Rejcha (1770-1836), until now underestimated great Czech composer, teacher and theoretician living mostly in Vienna and later in Paris. Rejcha mentioned in his theoretical works on music composition quartertones in old Greek music theory and practice and their compositional using in &quot;modern&quot; music, his ideas inspired J. F. Halevy who used quartertones in its incidental music to Promethee Enchaine (1849).<br/>He didn&apos;t mentioned Czech acoustician and amateur microtonalist Josef Sumec (1867-1934), who worked with 612 EDO and created four microintervallic reed organs (2 with 24 EDO, one 36 EDO, one 60 EDO). Maybe he didn&apos;t liked him (very often a relation of professional to amateur, kind of jealousy or who knows - Sumec was very clever and very advanced, but not musician, and he was criticising Haba&apos;s theoretical works and his prefering of quartertones. I would say he was right, Haba should listen to him more.).<br/>&gt; Of course, today, there are still many current of world music: and<br/>&gt; I often wonder how my colleagues Ozan Yarman and Shaahin Mohaajeri<br/>&gt; may view the diversity in which we all participate. My background<br/>&gt; is mostly in medieval European music, a curious vantagepoint, but<br/>&gt; no more nor less valid than any other.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>That&apos;s great, I love, study and have been performing medieval music for 25 years, especially Ars Subtilior from Yale university transcriptions from 50ies, in my arrangements for synthesizers (where is easy to setup different temperaments). It was a revelation for me to found this material. I&apos;m not so much interested in tunings in this context, but fascinated by rhythmic complexity, polymodality, and all that manneurism (colored notation, way of writing music without score in modern sense, without barlines and time signatures...). Absolutely inspiring for contemporary composers. Usually I combine at concerts my experimental, polystylistic, computer, microintervallic or improvised music with medieval and Renaissance music (especially Venosa), and sometimes listeners wondered how such old music can sound like contemporary one. Not because my music sounds so old, but opposite :-)<br/>&gt; As to 24-EDO, I do have some comments. In my view, it&apos;s a beautiful<br/>&gt; tuning, but necessarily a limited one -- as any equal temperament<br/>&gt; of around this size will necessarily be, since an EDO, from one<br/>&gt; viewpoint, is a strategy for getting the smallest possible number<br/>&gt; of interval sizes in a given tuning size &lt;grin&gt;.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; From a &quot;regional&quot; point of view, 24-EDO might be said to have three<br/>&gt; main categories or families of intervals, all useful, but, because<br/>&gt; of the modest size plus EDO structure, not as varied as may be<br/>&gt; required for some applications (hardly a unique &quot;flaw&quot;!).<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Being able to describe in what I hope are reasonably objective terms<br/>&gt; the types or regions of intervals offered by a given tuning system<br/>&gt; seems to me a desirable goal for 21st-century theory.

These are one of the &gt; greatest<br/>&gt; charms of the tuning, in my view: &quot;interseptimal&quot; refers to the fact<br/>&gt; each of these ratios is located between landmark septimal ratios such<br/>&gt; as 8:7 and 7:6 (231-250-267 cents); 9:7 and 21:16 (435-450-471 cents);<br/>&gt; 32:21 and 14:9 (729-750-765 cents); or 12:7 and 7:4 (933-950-969 &gt; cents).<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; These intervals are routine in Balinese or Javanese gamelan, for &gt; example,<br/>&gt; but &quot;revolutionary&quot; from a conventional European perspective since &gt; they<br/>&gt; seem about midway between two familiar categories such as &quot;major &gt; second&quot;<br/>&gt; and &quot;minor third.&quot; Indeed, following standard 14th-century European<br/>&gt; counterpoint patterns, 950 cents can nicely serve as either a wide &gt; major<br/>&gt; sixth expanding to an octave, or a narrow minor seventh contracting &gt; to a<br/>&gt; fifth. It&apos;s an interesting question whether more &quot;ebullient&quot;<br/>&gt; interpretations of the intonational precepts of Marchettus of Padua &gt; (1318)<br/>&gt; may have produced intervals in this region -- but, in any event, a &gt; fine<br/>&gt; harmonic resource for the 21st century.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; The interseptimal intervals of 24-EDO could be compared to just &gt; ratios of<br/>&gt; 15:13 or 22:19 (250 cents); 22:17 or 13:10 (450 cents); 20:13 or 17:11<br/>&gt; (750 cents); and 19:11 or 26:15 (950 cents).<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; A point to be emphasized is that from an historical European &gt; perspective,<br/>&gt; both the neutral and interseptimal families of 24-EDO represent &gt; &quot;the sound<br/>&gt; of the new&quot; -- although from a perspective of Near Eastern maqam/&gt; dastgah<br/>&gt; music or the custom-tuned ensembles of gamelan, the tuning might &gt; rather<br/>&gt; represent merely a quick sampler of the familiar, hopefully leading &gt; people<br/>&gt; coming from a European perspective who are intrigued by these &gt; sounds to<br/>&gt; look more deeply into these traditions where they have been in use for<br/>&gt; many centuries.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; On a &quot;regional&quot; approach to intervals and ratios, see also:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &lt;<a href="http://www.bestII.com/~mschulter/IntervalSpectrumRegions.txt">http://www.bestII.com/~mschulter/IntervalSpectrumRegions.txt</a>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>You have written here a brilliant analysis, but even after reading it somehow I didn&apos;t started to like 24 EDO... I used it in some of my microintervallic works, melodically just for making music different and more interesting, harmonically for neutral thirds, otherwise just as a sound effect, timbre in soundscapes, atmospheres...<br/>&gt; Again, Daniel, you&apos;re an ideal person to present this Haba material in<br/>&gt; its fuller human and musical context -- thank you!<br/>&gt;<br/>If you mean my person, thank you for your appreciation. I would say I can help with getting and translating material from Czech or some other languages if somebody is really interested, if I&apos;m interested as well, and find time for it. Or can try to get some records from my old country for analysis. Frankly said Haba somehow is not exactly my cup of green tea as a composer because of his quite traditional way of composition, there are much more interesting personalities in Czech music of 20th century, not necessarily working with microintervals. I will be happy to write sometimes about Moravian folklore, or anything about Czech music or some other (now I have a great opportunity to study more about Japanese music for example), as well about pop/jazz/rock, chords, harmony, or my own compositional using of microintervals... if there are some questions, answers could be found... I have many interests :-)<br/>&gt; Thanks also to the others who have enriched this discussion. The &gt; mention<br/>&gt; of 15th-century &quot;atonality&quot; is of great interest to me, and I am &gt; curious<br/>&gt; to which pieces or style this label might apply (I am aware of hotly<br/>&gt; debated attempts, as by Edward Lowinsky, to use this terminology in<br/>&gt; a 16th-century or early 17th-century context, as with Gesualdo -- and<br/>&gt; the strongly differing views of Richard Crocker and Carl Dahlhaus, for<br/>&gt; example).<br/>&gt;<br/>Then we have same love again. I don&apos;t think we can call this atonality, but as a working term it&apos;s OK. Atonality came after tonality as its negation, early &quot;atonality&quot; should be called maybe more apropriate &quot;primal chaos&quot;, from which later entropy of tonality came. What for me personally is interesting in this context is a chromaticism in European music from this early state until 12tone music... I collect scores of compositions using interesting chromatic progressions, be it melodically, polymelodically or harmonically. I&apos;d like to write one day some work from this material.<br/>And concerning tonality/atonality, it doesn&apos;t need to be antagonistic - it&apos;s possible to find a way how to combine it, which I have tried in many of my works. So I used for example different kinds of 12tone music, and result can sound quite tonal. Or tonal or modal melody is harmonized atonally...<br/>&gt; Some of the very adventurous pieces such as Solage&apos;s _Fumeux<br/>&gt; fume_ in the era of 1380-1400 or so,<br/>&gt;<br/>Oh, my beloved piece, almost my &quot;musical visitcard&quot; as I perform it at the beginning of almost every my concert. Unbelievable work. There are discussions what that &quot;fume&quot; was in that rather enigmatic lyrics of this piece, as tobacco was still unknown those times in Europe. It&apos;s not totally excluded it could be canabis, hashish or so...

Such a dialogue is the greatest delight<br/>and honor.</p><p>&gt;  Dear Margo Schulter,<br/>&gt;  thank you for your deep insight.</p><p>And likewise!</p><p>&gt;  Czech music theory was in the past connected to German one, so Czech<br/>&gt;  language uses the same system for names of tones, we distinct B and H<br/>&gt;  - that&apos;s the reason I could compose easily few pieces on B-A-C-H :-)</p><p>Yes, and with the change of hexachords, so to speak. I am somehow<br/>imagining it as a figure in a madrigal, and what Wert or Marenzio might<br/>do with it. Or, a 14th-century progression occur to me; this is an<br/>exercise for which I am long overdue! If I could compose something on<br/>this figure and post it here, that might be fun.</p><p>&gt;  We have as well -is endings for sharps, -es for flats, -isis for<br/>&gt;  double sharps, -eses for double flats (with few exceptions),<br/>&gt;  pronunciated as written:<br/>&gt;  Cis Dis Eis Fis Gis Ais His<br/>&gt;  Ces Des Es Fes Ges As Hes (or B pronunciated &quot;be&quot;)<br/>&gt;  Cisis Disis Eisis Fisis Gisis Aisis Hisis<br/>&gt;  Ceses Deses Eses Feses Geses Asas Heses<br/>&gt;  I have heard that Dutch uses some hybrid of German and English<br/>&gt;  system, as they have only B and use it with -is, -es endings for B<br/>&gt;  sharp and B flat (Bis, Bes). Maybe somebody here who knows Dutch will<br/>&gt;  confirm.</p><p>For some music, if the Dutch system is as you have heard, that might<br/>raise the question of how &quot;B#&quot; (His) as used by the Prince of Venosa,<br/>for example, would be identified, assuming that Bes is B and Bis is H<br/>(a logical usage given the hexachord system with B-fa and B-mi, or<br/>round and square B). Maybe Fokker&apos;s 31-note notation would give us a<br/>practical answer if he uses this Dutch system to name the notes, and<br/>his system is of course admirably suited to Venosa&apos;s music.</p><p>&gt;  Yes, indeed, last decades world is more connected thanks to media,<br/>&gt;  and recording technology of all kinds, and of course internet as<br/>&gt;  not always trustful source of information. We can now listen, study<br/>&gt;  and get scores to any music, one can find inspiration anywhere and<br/>&gt;  connect everything with everything. Which I do as well in my music,<br/>&gt;  prefering to make an organic synthesis, not just mix of<br/>&gt;  styles. Open minded people like Haba are happy with such<br/>&gt;  possibilities.</p><p>The &quot;connectivity&quot; as some people call it is indeed incredible; and I<br/>agree that some kind of organic synthesis should be a goal. George<br/>Secor, who sometimes posts here, lent me great impetus in 2001-2002 to<br/>seeking out coherent styles which indeed synthesize historical styles,<br/>and in the process arrive at new possibilities, or as I might say in<br/>the language of around 1600, new &quot;rhetorical figures.&quot;</p><p>This could be a fascinating discussion: how one discovers &quot;new rules,&quot;<br/>and integrates them into some kind of reasonably consistent style.</p><p>   &gt;&gt; It&apos;s fascinating that Haba cites a study of an 11th-century<br/>   &gt;&gt; manuscript from Montpellier (not to be confused with the<br/>   &gt;&gt; 13th-century collection of polyphony with which I&apos;m familiar)<br/>   &gt;&gt; having signs which, it&apos;s been argued, might represent microtonal<br/>   &gt;&gt; inflections.</p><p>&gt;  He mentioned it&apos;s considered to be quartertones.</p><p>&gt;  But concerning microintervals he totally omitted Antonin Rejcha<br/>&gt;  (1770-1836), until now underestimated great Czech composer, teacher<br/>&gt;  and theoretician living mostly in Vienna and later in Paris. Rejcha<br/>&gt;  mentioned in his theoretical works on music composition<br/>&gt;  quartertones in old Greek music theory and practice and their<br/>&gt;  compositional using in &quot;modern&quot; music, his ideas inspired<br/>&gt;  J. F. Halevy who used quartertones in its incidental music to<br/>&gt;  Promethee Enchaine (1849).  He didn&apos;t mentioned Czech acoustician<br/>&gt;  and amateur microtonalist Josef Sumec (1867-1934), who worked with<br/>&gt;  612 EDO and created four microintervallic reed organs (2 with 24<br/>&gt;  EDO, one 36 EDO, one 60 EDO).</p><p>This is a fascinating history. Rejcha interestingly represents around<br/>the period when &quot;modern&quot; Arab music theory is said to have started,<br/>with some Europeans reporting that either 17 thirdtones or 24<br/>quartertones were taken as the model for describing the modes or<br/>maqamat. I wonder if any of these Czech composers were acquainted with<br/>the writings of Vicentino or Colonna. Halevy&apos;s use of quartertones<br/>would be interesting to see, a side of the 19th century indeed not<br/>often mentioned as far as I know, although this isn&apos;t the most<br/>familiar era to me. Sometimes Sumac&apos;s 612-EDO model is discussed on<br/>this list, with Gene Ward Smith as one who likes it.</p><p>&gt;  Maybe he didn&apos;t liked him (very often a relation of professional to<br/>&gt;  amateur, kind of jealousy or who knows - Sumec was very clever and<br/>&gt;  very advanced, but not musician, and he was criticising Haba&apos;s<br/>&gt;  theoretical works and his prefering of quartertones. I would say he<br/>&gt;  was right, Haba should listen to him more.).</p><p>Certainly I&apos;d agree that precise quartertones of 1/24 octave are only<br/>a very small part of a vast universe. For Renaissance music, either<br/>31-EDO or a 31-note circle in 1/4-comma meantone (with one odd fifth<br/>virtually just!) would be an ideal choice, for example.</p><p>   &gt; Of course, today, there are still many current of world music: and<br/>   &gt; I often wonder how my colleagues Ozan Yarman and Shaahin Mohaajeri<br/>   &gt; may view the diversity in which we all participate. My background<br/>   &gt; is mostly in medieval European music, a curious vantagepoint, but<br/>   &gt; no more nor less valid than any other.</p><p>&gt;  That&apos;s great, I love, study and have been performing medieval music<br/>&gt;  for 25 years, especially Ars Subtilior from Yale university<br/>&gt;  transcriptions from 50ies, in my arrangements for synthesizers<br/>&gt;  (where is easy to setup different temperaments). It was a<br/>&gt;  revelation for me to found this material. I&apos;m not so much<br/>&gt;  interested in tunings in this context, but fascinated by rhythmic<br/>&gt;  complexity, polymodality, and all that manneurism (colored<br/>&gt;  notation, way of writing music without score in modern sense,<br/>&gt;  without barlines and time signatures...). Absolutely inspiring for<br/>&gt;  contemporary composers. Usually I combine at concerts my<br/>&gt;  experimental, polystylistic, computer, microintervallic or<br/>&gt;  improvised music with medieval and Renaissance music (especially<br/>&gt;  Venosa), and sometimes listeners wondered how such old music can<br/>&gt;  sound like contemporary one. Not because my music sounds so old,<br/>&gt;  but opposite :-)</p><p>When I was in college, the Ars Subtilior was one of my favorite eras<br/>also, and I had Willi Apel&apos;s transcriptions. Around the early 1980&apos;s,<br/>I recorded a few pieces using a monophonic synthesizer, one voice at a<br/>time, counting my minims; one of the pieces was transcribed by Richard<br/>Hoppin, and you nicely describe the nature of this music. If only I<br/>could read the original notation! Some modern transcriptions such as<br/>Apel&apos;s do use devices like irregular or alternative barlines in<br/>different parts.</p><p>Back then, I really didn&apos;t much consider tuning, and certainly, as you<br/>say, there are many other sides to this music.  However, nowadays, I<br/>sometimes find myself improvisating at the keyboard in this kind of<br/>style -- likely not as sophisticated in it as you have become, I must<br/>admit! -- in a regular temperament with fifths around 704 or 705<br/>cents. I should hear your music, and maybe record something like this.</p><p>      [Here, to save space, I&apos;ll refer readers to my discussion<br/>       of 24-EDO in my earlier post.]</p><p>&gt;  You have written here a brilliant analysis, but even after reading<br/>&gt;  it somehow I didn&apos;t started to like 24 EDO... I used it in some of<br/>&gt;  my microintervallic works, melodically just for making music<br/>&gt;  different and more interesting, harmonically for neutral thirds,<br/>&gt;  otherwise just as a sound effect, timbre in soundscapes,<br/>&gt;  atmospheres...</p><p>That&apos;s more than fair enough: analysis can explain the resources of a<br/>tuning, but tastes will vary much as before, I smile to reflect. Back<br/>in the year 2000, I can remember an enchanting evening session of<br/>improvising in 24-EDO; but it was indeed a momentary diversion from my<br/>main agenda, which often concerned -- then as now -- tunings with<br/>fifths wider than pure, and sometimes also meantone.</p><p>  &gt;&gt; Again, Daniel, you&apos;re an ideal person to present this Haba material in<br/>  &gt;&gt; its fuller human and musical context -- thank you!</p><p>  &gt; If you mean my person, thank you for your appreciation.</p><p>Yes, and your knowledge of earlier and contemporary developments puts<br/>Haba in a richer context. I might add that my comments could also<br/>apply to Daniel Stearns and Daniel Wolf as well: but your focus on<br/>medieval music gives us something in common that I find quite<br/>remarkable after exploring this music for 40 years.</p><p>&gt;  I would say I can help with getting and translating material from<br/>&gt;  Czech or some other languages if somebody is really interested, if<br/>&gt;  I&apos;m interested as well, and find time for it. Or can try to get<br/>&gt;  some records from my old country for analysis. Frankly said Haba<br/>&gt;  somehow is not exactly my cup of green tea as a composer because of<br/>&gt;  his quite traditional way of composition, there are much more<br/>&gt;  interesting personalities in Czech music of 20th century, not<br/>&gt;  necessarily working with microintervals. I will be happy to write<br/>&gt;  sometimes about Moravian folklore, or anything about Czech music or<br/>&gt;  some other (now I have a great opportunity to study more about<br/>&gt;  Japanese music for example), as well about pop/jazz/rock, chords,<br/>&gt;  harmony, or my own compositional using of microintervals...</p><p>The Haba text posted in PDF format makes me very curious about earlier<br/>Czech theory also, as well as about some of the other areas where<br/>translations could be very valuable also. One person I am very<br/>interested in is Peter Chelcicky, one of the greatest social<br/>philosophers of all time, I would say, whose book on the three estates<br/>might be very timely here in the U.S.A.</p><p>Your compositions and use of microintervals would very much interest<br/>me: it is often intriguing how people can share a common background,<br/>for example in the Ars Subtilior or the Manneristic style around 1600,<br/>and then take that in various creative directions. One of my main<br/>regrets is not having composed and recorded more, and your pieces may<br/>lend some inspiration to me and others here also.</p><p>&gt; if there are some questions, answers could be found... I have many<br/>&gt; interests :-)</p><p>This makes me think of a few records I have of Czech music, some of it<br/>from the 15th and 16th centuries: the notes discuss how some of the<br/>songs involve an element of social protest, which also comes up in<br/>something like the Roman de Fauvel in the early Ars Nova.</p><p>       [On &quot;atonality&quot; in 15th-16th century music]</p><p>&gt;  Then we have same love again. I don&apos;t think we can call this<br/>&gt;  atonality, but as a working term it&apos;s OK. Atonality came after<br/>&gt;  tonality as its negation, early &quot;atonality&quot; should be called maybe<br/>&gt;  more apropriate &quot;primal chaos&quot;, from which later entropy of<br/>&gt;  tonality came. What for me personally is interesting in this<br/>&gt;  context is a chromaticism in European music from this early state<br/>&gt;  until 12tone music... I collect scores of compositions using<br/>&gt;  interesting chromatic progressions, be it melodically,<br/>&gt;  polymelodically or harmonically. I&apos;d like to write one day some<br/>&gt;  work from this material.  And concerning tonality/atonality, it<br/>&gt;  doesn&apos;t need to be antagonistic - it&apos;s possible to find a way how<br/>&gt;  to combine it, which I have tried in many of my works.</p><p>&quot;Primal chaos&quot; is one possible phrase; maybe another is a kind of<br/>&quot;pleasant wandering,&quot; as with Pietro Aaron&apos;s remark in 1525 that some<br/>composers approach the modes like a child playing a game called<br/>_alleta_ or tag in which you can wander in almost any direction as<br/>long as you eventually return to your &quot;base.&quot;</p><p>Chromaticism is something that we&apos;ve both been intrigued by, and it<br/>seems to be that chromaticism may be especially effective in tuning<br/>systems where there&apos;s a rather large diesis or difference between cis<br/>and des, for example, say around 40-70 cents. This happens, of course,<br/>in a useful Renaissance meantone at around 1/4-comma to 1/3-comma, or<br/>with a fifth of 695-697 cents, say -- and again, with a &quot;neomedieval&quot;<br/>fifth at around 703-706 cents.</p><p>The idea of an anthology of historical examples of chromaticism would<br/>be a fine project! Of course, it would be a good idea to include<br/>&quot;enharmonicism&quot; or &quot;diesis-ism&quot; also, as with Vicentino, or Venosa&apos;s<br/>contrast of B# and C. Here&apos;s a piece of this kind from the Coimbra<br/>Manuscript in Portugal, which one scholar has suggested might date<br/>from the mid-16th century era of Vicentino, but sounds to me very much<br/>like something written around 1600, or the epoch of Venosa and<br/>Colonna:</p><p>        &lt;<a href="http://www.bestII.com/~mschulter/Coimbra48.mp3">http://www.bestII.com/~mschulter/Coimbra48.mp3</a>&gt;<br/>        &lt;<a href="http://www.bestII.com/~mschulter/Coimbra48.ps">http://www.bestII.com/~mschulter/Coimbra48.ps</a>&gt;</p><p>Here&apos;s a piece using some contrasting accidentals, also not as<br/>adventurously as with the diesis steps in the Coimbra piece:</p><p>        &lt;<a href="http://www.bestii.com/~mschulter/IntradaFLydian.mp3">http://www.bestii.com/~mschulter/IntradaFLydian.mp3</a>&gt;<br/>        &lt;<a href="http://www.bestii.com/~mschulter/IntradaFLydian.pdf">http://www.bestii.com/~mschulter/IntradaFLydian.pdf</a>&gt;</p><p>&gt;  So I used for example different kinds of 12tone music, and result<br/>&gt;  can sound quite tonal. Or tonal or modal melody is harmonized<br/>&gt;  atonally...</p><p>I&apos;d love to learn more about some of your favorite historical examples<br/>of chromaticism, or original pieces -- suspecting that the period<br/>around 1600 might be a favorite for us both in this area.</p><p>The idea of harmonizing a modal melody, or carrying through a<br/>contrapuntal idea, with a series of smooth and satisfying cadences or<br/>other progressions which yet are &quot;related only to each other&quot; rather<br/>than to any obvious modal procedure, might be one of the things you<br/>are discussing -- and I&apos;d like to explore it more also.</p><p>&gt;&gt;  Some of the very adventurous pieces such as Solage&apos;s _Fumeux &gt;<br/>&gt;&gt;  fume_ in the era of 1380-1400 or so,</p><p>&gt;  Oh, my beloved piece, almost my &quot;musical visitcard&quot; as I perform it<br/>&gt;  at the beginning of almost every my concert. Unbelievable<br/>&gt;  work. There are discussions what that &quot;fume&quot; was in that rather<br/>&gt;  enigmatic lyrics of this piece, as tobacco was still unknown those<br/>&gt;  times in Europe.  It&apos;s not totally excluded it could be canabis,<br/>&gt;  hashish or so... Then no wonder that music is like it is, if it was<br/>&gt;  inspired by drugs :-)</p><p>Yes, there are various theories about &quot;fume&quot; and the &quot;fumeurs&quot; --<br/>another view says that it could be like the English &quot;letting off<br/>steam&quot; in a way -- or, better, indulging ones &quot;humors,&quot; although the<br/>drug theory was popular around 1970. I love Solage&apos;s _S&apos;aincy estoit_,<br/>and Senleches, and some of the &quot;less complicated&quot; pieces also. Anyway,<br/>I would agree that _Fumeux fume_ is a _great_ musical visiting or<br/>calling card.</p><p>&gt;  I would be happy to exchange from time to time some facts about<br/>&gt;  this kind of music, you evidently know a lot about it.

Some points I would like to comment on are these:</p><p>1. Prosdocimus&apos; version of 17-tone Pythagorean tuning does seem to differ from Safi al-Din&apos;s suggestion in terms of ratios as you emphasized and as given in <a href="http://tonalsoft.com/monzo/article/article.htm">http://tonalsoft.com/monzo/article/article.htm</a>. I should have been more careful about that.</p><p>2. Safi al-Din&apos;s Rast utilizes 16/9 on the seventh degree, not 4096/2187. This is what we recognize as ajemli Rast. Notice also, that he does not ascribe to his scales the perde names we are familiar with today.</p><p>3. In part 2.2 G#-rast must be 496 cents, not 495. Also, you may consider exchanging places of perde saba with perde hijaz as I have done in my thesis. Otherwise, maqams Saba and Hijaz will not reflect quotidian practice.</p><p>4. Notice, that I lately deem ajemli Rast to require the conjunct union of Rast+Mahur tetrachords, not Rast+Rast as specified in my thesis. But either version will do fine depending on the performance tradition.</p><p>5. I admire the way you have so quickly adopted Turkish idioms on music theory!</p><p>6. Shirazi&apos;s Hijaz tetrachord is perfectly rendered, bravo! On second thought, you may like to keep the order of perdes saba and hijaz.</p><p>7. Not gevart, gevasht. Not buselek, buselik. Mind the Meva=Neva in part 3.</p><p>8. I like your approval of 79 MOS 2deg159tET and the way you help us picture it.</p><p>9. Carrying the chain of fifths to 29 notes sounds interesting. Maybe I should expand Yarman24 to accomodate 5 more pitches to reflect maqam intonation better.</p><p>10. Given my lack of knowledge on the particulars of Persian dastgah theory, I can only read your excursions with a smile on my face. :)</p><p>11. Do not be so hasty in disregarding Safi al-Din as a theorist favouring middle second flavours. For indeed, he defines Isfahan as JJJB = 13:12 x 14:13 x 15:14 x 16:15, Zirefkend-i Kutchek as 10:9 x 81:70 x 13:12 x 14:13, and Buzurg as 23:22 x 14:13 x 13:12 x 8:7 x 14:13 (no other than today&apos;s Huzzam) in his treatise &quot;Risala al-Sharafiyyah&quot;.

The scheme suggested here borrows extensively<br/>&gt; from recent Turkish usage, while seeking to remedy such anomalies as<br/>&gt; the frequent omission of neutral second steps because of ideological<br/>&gt; factors, specifically a political dislike for associating the Turkish<br/>&gt; heritage of maqam music with &quot;Arab&quot; and &quot;Byzantine&quot; systems featuring<br/>&gt; the use of &quot;quartertones.&quot; Your dissertation, Ozan, of course covers<br/>&gt; all of this history and more in great detail, a fascinating education<br/>&gt; for me and others who read it.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Aaron, and others who may be new to this, I should explain that Near<br/>&gt; Eastern theory offers various degrees of &quot;resolution&quot; or specificity<br/>&gt; in defining the types or sizes of intervals that are -- or in the<br/>&gt; writer&apos;s view should be -- used in the intonation of a given<br/>&gt; tetrachord, maqam, etc.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; A &quot;low resolution&quot; system says basically: &quot;This step is or should be a<br/>&gt; tone, semitone, neutral second, or an &quot;augmented step&quot; or<br/>&gt; &quot;plus-second&quot; often equal to some kind of minor third ranging from<br/>&gt; septimal or slightly smaller up to around Pythagorean.&quot;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; For example, consider a typical Arab form of a tetrachord or _jins_<br/>&gt; (from the Greek _genus_) named Rast, also the name of a maqam or modal<br/>&gt; complex drawing its basic steps from two of these tetrachords. Here&apos;s<br/>&gt; a low-resolution notation for this variety of Rast using an<br/>&gt; approximate quartertone system (common in 19th-21st century Arab<br/>&gt; theory) or an approximate thirdtone system. Note that &quot;d&quot; represents a<br/>&gt; half-flat symbol used to show an _approximate_ quartertone alteration,<br/>&gt; but not necessarily one of precisely 50 cents as in 24-EDO!<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;          C     D    Ed    F<br/>&gt; 24:       0     4    7    10<br/>&gt;             4    3    3<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; 17:       0     3    5    7<br/>&gt;             3    2    2<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Describing Rast as 4-3-3 in the 24-step system or 3-2-2 in the 17-step<br/>&gt; system is a very useful shorthand, but leaves open, for example, just<br/>&gt; how the neutral third of the tetrachord should be placed, and which of<br/>&gt; the two neutral second steps, the first or the second, should be<br/>&gt; larger or smaller. These issues wouldn&apos;t come up in 17-EDO or 24-EDO,<br/>&gt; where there is only one size of neutral second step -- but will come<br/>&gt; in traditional performances of Near Eastern music, where there are<br/>&gt; almost infinite shadings of these steps and playing &quot;in tune&quot; involves<br/>&gt; an appreciation of this.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; A 53-comma notation, or the letter notation of the Persian theorist<br/>&gt; Hormoz Farhat, addresses these vital questions but still leaves lots<br/>&gt; of room for &quot;fine-tuning,&quot; or for the vagaries of different JI or<br/>&gt; tempered systems. Here&apos;s a middle-level description of Rast in both<br/>&gt; these systems:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; 53:        C      D     Ed    F<br/>&gt;           0      9     16   22<br/>&gt;              9      7     6<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Farhat:       M      N     n<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Just as the 17-step and 24-step notations don&apos;t necessarily imply<br/>&gt; using 17-EDO or 24-EDO, so the 53-step or 53-comma system doesn&apos;t<br/>&gt; necessarily imply 53-EDO or Pythagorean: rather it provides a handy<br/>&gt; numerical shorthand that can be adapted to various tuning systems, or<br/>&gt; to flexible-pitch performance (often the main focus!). Farhat&apos;s system<br/>&gt; uses letters to show a (M)ajor second, large (N)eutral or small<br/>&gt; (n)eutral step, or (m)inor second step -- the last not used in Rast.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Read literally in 53-EDO terms, the 9-7-6 notation would call for<br/>&gt; steps of 204-158-136 cents -- a very pleasant tuning, in fact, but<br/>&gt; only one of many possibilities fitting the spirit of this or Farhat&apos;s<br/>&gt; M-N-n notation.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; The important point is that we are told not only that this version of<br/>&gt; Rast has a lower tone plus two neutral seconds, but that the lower<br/>&gt; neutral second is the larger one.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; The 53-comma system is also very useful in distinguishing this flavor<br/>&gt; of Rast, the usual one in Arab theory, with a different flavor known<br/>&gt; in medieval and modern times, and the one taken as the standard model,<br/>&gt; so to speak, in modern Turkey:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; 53:        C      D      E    F<br/>&gt;           0      9     17   22<br/>&gt;              9      8     5<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; This is a 5-limit flavor of Rast, as shown by the 53-comma notation.<br/>&gt; Interestingly, as in your 79-MOS, Ozan, this tuning might actually be<br/>&gt; realized by a single unbroken chain of fifths with at least some of<br/>&gt; these generators tempered, as in a European meantone. What 9-8-5<br/>&gt; notation shows us is the 5-limit pattern, in contrast to 9-7-6 with<br/>&gt; its use of two neutral seconds and a largish neutral third rather than<br/>&gt; a 5:4 major third.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; A &quot;high-resolution&quot; notation, of course, could use cents; or JI<br/>&gt; ratios; or steps smaller than a 53-comma, as with the 79-MOS, where<br/>&gt; the usual unit is the yarman, equal to about 2/3 of a comma or about<br/>&gt; 15.09 cents. Indeed, thinking of yarmans as &quot;just a tad larger than<br/>&gt; 15 cents&quot; is a great shortcut for keeping track of them! That,<br/>&gt; however, is another topic and another post.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Getting back to the 53-comma system, I should explain that the table<br/>&gt; below isn&apos;t meant to cover all intervals, but those either likely to<br/>&gt; be used as basic steps in maqam and dastgah music, or smaller than<br/>&gt; these usual steps but important for measuring certain inflections or<br/>&gt; differences in size: the comma itself, and the 2-comma category, which<br/>&gt; could be called a demi-limma, half-limma, or medieval diaschisma (not<br/>&gt; to be confused with another use of this last term for a smaller<br/>&gt; interval of 2048:2025 or about 19.55 cents).<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; One general set of categories might invite a quick explanation: the<br/>&gt; &quot;augmented&quot; step or &quot;plus-second&quot; ranging from a bit larger than 8:7<br/>&gt; up through 15:13 (11 commas) and the 7:6 minor third (12 commas) up to<br/>&gt; around a Pythagorean minor third (13 commas). This is the middle step<br/>&gt; of a tetrachord type known as Hijaz, and also in the Persian tradition<br/>&gt; as Chahargah (or Turkish Chargah). One tradition style of tuning for<br/>&gt; Hijaz might be about as follows:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;              D    Ed     F#   G<br/>&gt; cents         0    140   408  498<br/>&gt;               140    268   90<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; 53-commas     0    6     18   22<br/>&gt;                6     12    4<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; To show how the 53-comma system might be adapted to a temperament,<br/>&gt; categories corresponding to the Pythagorean of 53-EDO ones are shown<br/>&gt; for a regular temperament known as the &quot;e-based&quot; tuning since the<br/>&gt; ratio between the regular tone and diatonic semitone or limma is equal<br/>&gt; to Euler&apos;s e, around 2.71828 -- thus a fifth around 704.607 cents.<br/>&gt; The categories often map reasonably well, although the chains of<br/>&gt; generators are often different -- thus the Pythagorean or 53-EDO<br/>&gt; 12-comma at around 23 cents matches up with the e-based 17-comma at<br/>&gt; around 22 cents.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; ----------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>&gt;       Middle-resolution categories based on 53-comma system<br/>&gt; ----------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>&gt; 53-EDO type    commas  cents  symbol   e-based type  53-commas  cents<br/>&gt; ----------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>&gt; 12-comma         1     22.64     F     17-comma        0.96     21.68<br/>&gt; ......................................................................<br/>&gt; demi-limma       2     45.28     D     --------       -----     -----<br/>&gt; ......................................................................<br/>&gt; reduced limma    3     67.92     E     12-diesis       2.44     55.28<br/>&gt; ----------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>&gt; limma            4     90.57     B     limma           3.40     76.97<br/>&gt; ----------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>&gt; apotome          5    113.21     S     limma + comma   4.36     98.65<br/>&gt; ......................................................................<br/>&gt; small neut 2nd   6    135.85     Js    apotome         5.84    132.25<br/>&gt; ......................................................................<br/>&gt; large neut 2nd   7    158.49     Jk    dim 3rd         6.80    153.93<br/>&gt; ......................................................................<br/>&gt; dim 3rd          8    181.13     K     reduced tone    8.28    187.53<br/>&gt; ----------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>&gt; tone             9    203.77     T     tone            9.24    209.21<br/>&gt; ......................................................................<br/>&gt; large tone      10    226.42     T10   large tone     10.20    230.90<br/>&gt; ----------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>&gt; hemifourth      11    249.06     A11   ----------     -----    ------<br/>&gt; ......................................................................<br/>&gt; small min 3rd   12    271.70     A12   small min 3rd  11.68    264.50<br/>&gt; ......................................................................<br/>&gt; min 3rd         13    294.34     A13   min 3rd        12.64    286.18<br/>&gt; ----------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Much more could be said about the history of some of these symbols in<br/>&gt; recent Turkish theory, and I&apos;d warmly invite you to add any helpful<br/>&gt; details or corrections, Ozan or anyone else.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; With many thanks,<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Margo<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; ------------------------------------<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; You can configure your subscription by sending an empty email to one<br/>&gt; of these addresses (from the address at which you receive the list):<br/>&gt;  <a href="mailto:tuning-subscribe@yahoogroups.com">tuning-subscribe@yahoogroups.com</a> - join the tuning group.<br/>&gt;  <a href="mailto:tuning-unsubscribe@yahoogroups.com">tuning-unsubscribe@yahoogroups.com</a> - leave the group.<br/>&gt;  <a href="mailto:tuning-nomail@yahoogroups.com">tuning-nomail@yahoogroups.com</a> - turn off mail from the group.<br/>&gt;  <a href="mailto:tuning-digest@yahoogroups.com">tuning-digest@yahoogroups.com</a> - set group to send daily digests.<br/>&gt;  <a href="mailto:tuning-normal@yahoogroups.com">tuning-normal@yahoogroups.com</a> - set group to send individual emails.<br/>&gt;  <a href="mailto:tuning-help@yahoogroups.com">tuning-help@yahoogroups.com</a> - receive general help information.<br/>&gt; Yahoo!

Some points I would like to<br/>&gt; comment on are these:</p><p>Dear Yarman,</p><p>Thank you for your helpful corrections and notes, ranging from one<br/>comical typographical error I&apos;m amazed I didn&apos;t catch to a real<br/>mistake about a perde name to a serious error of omission I definitely<br/>will correct in a revised version of the longer letter, giving you<br/>credit for prompting me to write a new section which needs to be<br/>included.</p><p>Having such an attentive and informed reader is invaluable; and your<br/>judgment may be helpful when I write the section which shouldn&apos;t have<br/>been left out, as explained below.</p><p>&gt; 1. Prosdocimus&apos; version of 17-tone Pythagorean tuning does seem to<br/>&gt; differ from Safi al-Din&apos;s suggestion in terms of ratios as you<br/>&gt; emphasized and as given in<br/>&gt; [35]<a href="http://tonalsoft.com/monzo/article/article.htm">http://tonalsoft.com/monzo/article/article.htm</a> . I should have<br/>&gt; been more careful about that.</p><p>What I might say is that knowing what could be called the polyphonic<br/>seyir of 13th-14th century European pieces helps in understanding<br/>Prosdocimus -- just as your familiarity with the maqamat in various<br/>parts of the Near East helps you in appreciating the tunings of Safi<br/>al-Din al-Urmavi. It should be emphasized, of course that the wealth<br/>of middle or neutral steps in the Islamic tradition means a radically<br/>richer system of maqamat or dastgah-ha than any scheme of classic<br/>European modes or keys, although these too follow a kind of seyir.</p><p>&gt; 2. Safi al-Din&apos;s Rast utilizes 16/9 on the seventh degree, not<br/>&gt; 4096/2187. This is what we recognize as ajemli Rast. Notice also,<br/>&gt; that he does not ascribe to his scales the perde names we are<br/>&gt; familiar with today.</p><p>This is a vital correction, as re-reading your colleague&apos;s article on<br/>Urmavi also reminded me! In my revision, I will make this clear while<br/>showing both the conjunct form of Urmavi (acemli Rast) and the<br/>disjunct form.</p><p>&gt; 3. In part 2.2 G#-rast must be 496 cents, not 495. Also, you may<br/>&gt; consider exchanging places of perde saba with perde hijaz as I have<br/>&gt; done in my thesis. Otherwise, maqams Saba and Hijaz will not reflect<br/>&gt; quotidian practice.</p><p>As to your first point, indeed my cents were inconsistent! Here I<br/>think that 495 cents, following the &quot;theoretically correct&quot; rather<br/>than 1024-EDO tuning, might be better for the sake of simplicity in<br/>showing the 17-MOS structure. With the 79-MOS of 159-EDO -- or close<br/>to it! -- you may have a special motivation to use precise rather than<br/>regular 159-EDO values, in order to show the just 4:3 and 3:2 fourths<br/>and fifths.</p><p>The saba/hijaz question is a bit unclear, as you note below.<br/>Curiously, with this temperament, either the third step of Maqam Hijaz<br/>or the fourth step of Maqam Sabah, starting from dugah, is typically<br/>at around 56/39 or 16/11 from rast; 39/28 is very typical of Maqam<br/>Penchgah (1/1-44/39-21/17-39/28-3/2 or 0-209-363-572-705 cents).<br/>However, if we agree with a Turkish source you have cited that what I<br/>call Buzurg-Hijaz or JTJ at 6-10-6 commas or 9-15-9 yarmans, then if<br/>starting from perde dugah, we will indeed use perde hijaz as the third<br/>step! That could be an argument for the modern ordering of these<br/>names. What I should do in the revision is make the difference between<br/>the old and new names clear, at least.</p><p>&gt; 4. Notice, that I lately deem ajemli Rast to require the conjunct<br/>&gt; union of Rast+Mahur tetrachords, not Rast+Rast as specified in my<br/>&gt; thesis. But either version will do fine depending on the performance<br/>&gt; tradition.</p><p>Interesting! Both forms are familiar to me, and seem in Arab theory<br/>recognized as variations on Rast, as a &quot;family&quot; defined mainly by the<br/>lower tetrachord. Curiously, conjunct Rast|Mahur is known in Arab<br/>theory as, of all things, Suz-i Dilara! Given a few hints you have<br/>offered about the nature of that terkib, I suspect that this could be<br/>one aspect of a complex set of inflections or modulations.</p><p>&gt; 5. I admire the way you have so quickly adopted Turkish idioms on<br/>&gt; music theory!</p><p>Thank you -- of course, I have just begun to learn.</p><p>&gt; 6. Shirazi&apos;s Hijaz tetrachord is perfectly rendered, bravo! On<br/>&gt; second thought, you may like to keep the order of perdes saba and<br/>&gt; hijaz.</p><p>It&apos;s an open question: apart from &quot;Buzurg-Hijaz&quot; or JTJ, it&apos;s true<br/>that I tend to take Hijaz as 154-264-77 or 132-286-77 cents, which<br/>could be 10-18-5 or 9-19-5 yarmans -- once again, the 79-MOS nicely<br/>emulates another tuning system! Saba, a real beginner&apos;s delight for me<br/>with the help of your writings, is another topic.</p><p>&gt; 7. Not gevart, gevasht. Not buselek, buselik. Mind the Meva=Neva in<br/>&gt; part 3.</p><p>On gevart, that was my confusion of the name; buselek looks like a<br/>typo (I would use buselik as a Turkish form and busalik in an Arab<br/>spelling); and Meva could be a sign I had problems reading my font on<br/>the computer screen! Thanks for catching them all. By the way, it&apos;s<br/>interesting that Safi al-Din&apos;s Abusalik or B-T-T looks like modern<br/>Kurdi. His Nawa (or Neva) or T-B-T is the modern Buselik.</p><p>&gt; 8. I like your approval of 79 MOS 2deg159tET and the way you help us<br/>&gt; picture it.</p><p>It&apos;s lots of fun, and to be involved in a dlalogue with the designer<br/>of such a system is a special delight.</p><p>&gt; 9. Carrying the chain of fifths to 29 notes sounds<br/>&gt; interesting. Maybe I should expand Yarman24 to accomodate 5 more<br/>&gt; pitches to reflect maqam intonation better.</p><p>Your new Yarman29 is something I&apos;ll look at closely --<br/>congratulations! With the 704.607-cent tuning, I do find the 24-note<br/>version convenient for two standard keyboards, but the 29-MOS could be<br/>a very attractive set.</p><p>&gt; 10. Given my lack of knowledge on the particulars of Persian dastgah<br/>&gt; theory, I can only read your excursions with a smile on my face. :)</p><p>I wonder what Shaahin might say.</p><p>&gt; 11. Do not be so hasty in disregarding Safi al-Din as a theorist<br/>&gt; favouring middle second flavours. For indeed, he defines Isfahan as<br/>&gt; JJJB = 13:12 x 14:13 x 15:14 x 16:15, Zirefkend-i Kutchek as 10:9 x<br/>&gt; 81:70 x 13:12 x 14:13, and Buzurg as 23:22 x 14:13 x 13:12 x 8:7 x<br/>&gt; 14:13 (no other than today&apos;s Huzzam) in his treatise &quot;Risala al-<br/>&gt; Sharafiyyah&quot;. Why he constructs a 17-tone Pythagorean scale given<br/>&gt; these divisions of the pentachord, I am at a loss to explain. Maybe<br/>&gt; you can shed some light on the situation.</p><p>This is the critically important point I referred to at the beginning:<br/>while it was certainly not my intention to disregard Safi al-Din&apos;s use<br/>of middle intervals in any way, I realize that I indeed very seriously<br/>erred in omitting these tetrachords and maqamat from my examples,<br/>where they should have been included along with those of Ibn Sina and<br/>Qutb al-Din al-Shirazi.</p><p>Actually I may have erred out of caution, or a desire not to get<br/>things wrong, given how one sometimes finds different ratios from<br/>different people for a given tuning of Safi al-Din. However, that is<br/>not a complication limited to his tunings only &lt;grin&gt;, and I agree<br/>that, having presented his 17-note tuning, I _must_, for the sake of<br/>balance, include some of these beautiful neutral steps of his also!</p><p>Reading Dr. Fazli Arslan&apos;s paper again, and looking over your<br/>examples, helps a great deal in this. As you note in another post,<br/>your intervals for Buzurg here need to be read in the reverse<br/>direction; or, in other words, are correct if read starting with the<br/>shortest two strings or highest notes at 23:22.</p><p>A small point about Safi al-Din&apos;s Isfahan. While indeed he defines it<br/>as 12:13:14:15:16 (Arslan, p. 11), it&apos;s curious that (ibid. p. 19) he<br/>also defines it JJJB, which Arslan takes to mean that the last step is<br/>a limma rather than an apotome (which at 2187:2048 or 113.685 cents<br/>would, of course, be equivalent to 16:15). If JJJB indeed means an<br/>upper limma step, then I could be tempted to try something like<br/>13:12-14:13-12:11-22:21 (a tempered 0-132-264-418-495 cents). This<br/>might involve an interesting seyir. However, if this is indeed a<br/>stretch, I might be wiser to stick with a number of other fine<br/>tetrachords and maqamat where such a &quot;creative&quot; reading isn&apos;t needed.</p><p>&gt; 12. Check the spelling for common practoce in the conclusion part.</p><p>Ah, at first I took this to mean that I had again erred on the<br/>spelling of some perde names -- but I see that &quot;common practoce&quot; is<br/>itself the spelling that needs correction! That might help to explain<br/>my perde meva!</p><p>&gt; 13.

Do not be so hasty in disregarding Safi al-Din as a theorist<br/>&gt;&gt; favouring middle second flavours.

Why he constructs a 17-tone Pythagorean scale given<br/>&gt;&gt; these divisions of the pentachord, I am at a loss to explain. Maybe<br/>&gt;&gt; you can shed some light on the situation.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; SNIP<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Reading Dr. Fazli Arslan&apos;s paper again, and looking over your<br/>&gt; examples, helps a great deal in this. As you note in another post,<br/>&gt; your intervals for Buzurg here need to be read in the reverse<br/>&gt; direction; or, in other words, are correct if read starting with the<br/>&gt; shortest two strings or highest notes at 23:22.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; A small point about Safi al-Din&apos;s Isfahan. While indeed he defines it<br/>&gt; as 12:13:14:15:16 (Arslan, p. 11), it&apos;s curious that (ibid. p. 19) he<br/>&gt; also defines it JJJB, which Arslan takes to mean that the last step is<br/>&gt; a limma rather than an apotome (which at 2187:2048 or 113.685 cents<br/>&gt; would, of course, be equivalent to 16:15). If JJJB indeed means an<br/>&gt; upper limma step, then I could be tempted to try something like<br/>&gt; 13:12-14:13-12:11-22:21 (a tempered 0-132-264-418-495 cents). This<br/>&gt; might involve an interesting seyir. However, if this is indeed a<br/>&gt; stretch, I might be wiser to stick with a number of other fine<br/>&gt; tetrachords and maqamat where such a &quot;creative&quot; reading isn&apos;t needed.<br/>&gt;</p><p>Ah, but here is the critical bit of information not previously given: Urmavi explains a tetrachord that also he names &quot;the first single kind&quot; (Isfahan)!</p><p>13/12 x 14/13 x 13/12 x 96/91.</p><p>This conforms with JJJB.</p><p>In which case, Isfahan seems to exhibit two versions.</p><p>I send you and Manuel the Scala scale files.
