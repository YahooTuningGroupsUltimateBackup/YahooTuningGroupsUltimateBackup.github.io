This is not something I have investigated as<br/>of yet, however I have it in mind as a piece of the picture of what may be<br/>desired for purposes of controlling &quot;compositional keyboard playing&quot;.  This<br/>is approaching the whole question from a different end.  There may likely be<br/>some overlap with the concepts of automatic retuning.
