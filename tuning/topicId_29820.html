Eventually I decided the RI orientation<br/>was not quite modelling what I wanted to hear in that it<br/>would find minima at the &quot;usual suspects&quot; as well as minima<br/>which fell into pockets that were somewhat unusual suspects<br/>(like a scale which contained one very accurate ~14/11 and<br/>one very accurate ~13/7).</p><p>Given a pattern, I could tell you where the program sees as<br/>minima in &quot;complexity/out-of-tune-ness&quot; and the RI<br/>interpretation he is giving there. I have a &quot;dial&quot; on<br/>the complexity which does some amount of constraining of<br/>the limit it considers as perceivable at a certain<br/>mistuning (how good its ears are).</p><p>Currently, in anticipation of the 31et guitar, (and in<br/>some anticipation of a further future 41et instrument,<br/>probably a long scale guitar, something like a baritone<br/>guitar / piccolo bass sort of creature though this is<br/>a few years down the road and things may change... ),<br/>I&apos;ve just been cataloguing reasonable &quot;white note scales&quot;.<br/>(&quot;white note&quot; is probably along the lines of 5 to 13 notes,<br/>though in the thread working on Jackys conundrum, I<br/>ended up with a 24-out-of-31), and occasionally<br/>tuning the &quot;piano&quot; to them and fiddling about. (So<br/>far I&apos;ve only done this with 31, but some of the 41<br/>relationships look really interesting so they are<br/>on the &quot;to do&quot; list).</p><p>So here are some of the entries from 8 to 13 notes. Note<br/>that I&apos;m not paying a lot of emphasis at this point to<br/>proper-ness if thats a concern, though I&apos;m also tending<br/>away from extreme values of L/s and &quot;overly chromatic<br/>sounding&quot; scales (like 66667 in 31, not that they<br/>aren&apos;t yet-another-wonderful-resource, just that I<br/>don&apos;t want to go there for melodic play as a first step).</p><p>Linking to this ~7/6 generator idea, all I know is<br/>to look for presence of ^7/31 or ^9/41 which I&apos;ll mark<br/>with a *. What I&apos;m more thinking of is analogs across<br/>the meantone and pythagorean and/or schismic space<br/>using these new white note structures (which I&apos;ll<br/>mark with &lt;&gt;).</p><p>pattern          31et             41et<br/>                a    b           a    b<br/>aabaabab        5    2 *  &lt;&gt;     7    2 *<br/>                2    7 *         4    7</p><p>ababababa       3    4 *         5    4 *</p><p>aabaabaaab      4    1    &lt;&gt;     5    2<br/>                                 2    9 *</p><p>aaabaaabaab     2    5 *</p><p>aabaabaabab                      3    5</p><p>aababaababab    3    2    &lt;&gt;     3    4 !</p><p>aababaababaab   2    3 *  &lt;&gt;     2    5 *</p><p>&gt;<br/>&gt; I think your name should be popping up a lot more in Graham&apos;s list!</p><p>Lots of these have an emphasis on ~7/6, but I&apos;m just a<br/>&quot;low limit but higher than five&quot; kind of guy.</p><p>This was a good excercise for me since I gathered up these scales<br/>from a bunch of different napkins. The reason I put the &apos;!&apos; on<br/>the 12-note pattern is that this is the mapping from meantone to<br/>pythagorean which only links the ~3/2.</p><p> 2 3 3  2  3  2  3  3  2  3  2  3<br/>0 2 5  8 10 13 15 18 21 23 26 28</p><p> 4 3 3  4  3  4  3  4  3  3  4  3<br/>0 3 7 10 14 17 21 24 28 31 34 38</p><p>I dunno if that helps at all, but thanks for giving me a poke.</p><p>Bob Valentine</p><p>&gt;<br/>&gt; -Paul</p></div>
