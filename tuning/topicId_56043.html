The biggest annoyance I have with the new version of Cakewalk is that there isn&apos;t any interface that I can find for editing note names for the piano roll, but the old files still work, and I&apos;ve found out that it&apos;s just stored in an editable text file, so I really don&apos;t need to edit it from inside Cakewalk. In any case, the event list is still there, and functions pretty much the same as in the earlier version. But there are versions of Cakewalk that don&apos;t have the event list, so be sure to check the feature list.</p></div>
