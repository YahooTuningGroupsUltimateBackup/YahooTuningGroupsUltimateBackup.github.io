This is the consistency issue I&apos;ve brought up many times<br/>before. As an example, Max Meyer (and more recently, Joe Monzo) have<br/>suggested 24-tone equal temperament (quartertones) as a way of achieving<br/>better 7-limit harmony. The 7:4 is only 19 cents sharp of 4 3/4 tones, 7:5<br/>is only 17 cents flat of 3 tones, and 7:6 is only 17 cents sharp of 1 1/2<br/>tones. But this will not lead to better 7-limit tetrads. For example, adding<br/>the 4 3/4-tone interval above the root of a 4:5:6 (major) triad (tuned as in<br/>12-equal) leads to a representation of 7:5 which is an unacceptable 33 cents<br/>flat. Using 12-equal, the 7:5 is only 17 cents flat, but the 7:6 is 33, and<br/>the 7:4 is 31, cents sharp.</p><p>Wendy Carlos, Yunik &amp; Swift, and Ezra Sims are among those who don&apos;t appear<br/>to have realized the implications of inconsistency. When I met Sims and we<br/>discussed the issue, he admitted that I raised a good point but told me that<br/>triads went out a long time ago. I don&apos;t know what he meant, since much of<br/>his music uses more than two voices. On the other hand, William Stoney&apos;s<br/>evaluation starts by constructing a complete harmonic chord (3, 5, 7, and<br/>15-limit) in each equal temperament, and calculates the approximation<br/>quality of each of the intervals in that chord. Since the complete chord is<br/>constructed first, there is no possibility for the approximations evaluated<br/>to be inconsistent with one another. This means, of course, that in equal<br/>temperaments that would normally be considered inconsistent in the given<br/>limit, some intervals are approximated with an error larger than half a<br/>step.</p><p>Stoney&apos;s method of constructing the complete chord is interesting. He<br/>considers the approximations of three consecutive harmonics, starting and<br/>ending with even ones, to be &quot;proportionally spaced&quot; if the middle tone is<br/>closer (in cents) to the higher tone than to the lower. &quot;Neutral spacing&quot;<br/>occurs if the middle tone is halfway between the upper and lower tones.<br/>&quot;Inverse spacing&quot; occurs if the middle tone is closer to the lower tone than<br/>to the upper tone. Stoney rejects the possibility of inverse spacing, and<br/>subject to that constraint he essentially uses the closest approximation (in<br/>cents) to each harmonic. For example, he evaluates 12-tone equal temperament<br/>as follows:</p><p>&quot;<br/>ORDNO Cents Value  HARFAC  Deviation<br/>0       0.000      8     0.000<br/>1&#x9;100.000<br/>2     200.000      9    -3.910<br/>3     300.000<br/>4     400.000     10    13.687<br/>5     500.000<br/>6     600.000     11    48.682<br/>7     700.000     12    -1.955<br/>8     800.000<br/>9     900.000     13    59.473<br/>10   1000.000     14    31.175<br/>11   1100.000     15    11.732<br/>12   1200.000     16     0.000</p><p>Deviations Summary:<br/>8:12         -1.955<br/>8:10:12      AVER 10.427   MAX 10:12 -15.641   MIN 8:12 -1.955<br/>8:10:12:14   AVER 18.846   MAX 12:14  33.130   MIN 8:12 -1.955<br/>8 THRU 15    AVER 27.111   MAX  9:13  63.383   MIN 8:12 -1.955<br/>&quot;</p><p>He places the 13th harmonic at 900 rather than 800 cents to acheive<br/>proportional spacing, despite the 59-cent error involved. However, placing<br/>it at 800 cents would lead to other large errors, such as a 13:11 than is 89<br/>cents flat. Since he is including all intervals within the limit in his<br/>evaluation, his &quot;proportional spacing&quot; criterion is (inadvertently) a good<br/>method for penalizing tunings for inconsistency.</p><p>His conclusions:</p><p>&quot;<br/>  1. The conventional 12-semitone temperament yields greatest purity of<br/>intonation in the simpler intervals of the fifth and fourth, moderate<br/>deviation for thirds and sixths, and the rather lagre deviation of 31 cents<br/>for he seventh harmonic. The existence of the eleventh and thirteenth<br/>harmonics is doubtful.<br/>  2. Any improvement over the 12-semitone temperament, for purposes of just<br/>intonation, would require at least 19 degrees to the octave.<br/>  3. A 17-degree system yields good fifths (705.9 Cents) but too wide thirds<br/>(423.5 Cents). A 19-degree system yields nearly just thirds; its fifths are<br/>7 Cents narrower than just. A 22-degree system yields a reasonable<br/>approximation of just intonation through the twelfth harmonic, and good<br/>relative spacing but too sharp intonation (by 32 Cents) of the thirteenth<br/>harmonic. The fifth is 7 cents wider than the just value.<br/>  [...]<br/>  In summary of the above, systems (in ascending order of average deviation<br/>for HARFACS 8 through 15) of 72, 58, 53, 70, 65, and 41 degrees yield low<br/>fifth deviation of 2 Cents or less, very good relative spacing, and<br/>acceptable approximation of harmonics 8 through 15. A temperament of 31<br/>degrees has merit, but the fifth deviation of -5 Cents is relatively large.<br/>The most promising low-order systems are those of 24, 22, and 19 degrees.<br/>For these last three systems practical experimentation over an adequate<br/>period of time and utilizing suitable designed instruments would be required<br/>in order to assess their respective deficiencies and merits.<br/>&quot;</p><p>The article was published in _The Computer and Music_, edited by Harry B.<br/>Lincoln, Cornell University Press, 1970.</p></div><h3><a id=2680 href="#2680">ðŸ”—</a>Paul Hahn &#x3C;Paul-Hahn@xxxxxxx.xxxxx.xxxx&#x3E;</h3><span>5/6/1999 9:31:21 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>On Wed, 5 May 1999, Paul H.
