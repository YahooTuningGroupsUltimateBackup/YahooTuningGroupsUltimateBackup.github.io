The context involved extremely<br/>slow, simple playing in a droning style, where for instance the synth<br/>and the cello would be playing in unison over a drone. So there<br/>wasn&apos;t much use of random pitch (as my synth was providing a<br/>reference some of the time) - and I was deliberately using simple<br/>chord structures so as to make a 6 cents melodic shift audible - I<br/>realize that this would take some careful listening for the<br/>uninitiated. Even though this small of an interval fits within<br/>the &quot;limit of discrimination&quot; if you tune this up and play the<br/>interval in the middle range - with a string-like timbre, both<br/>simultaneously, then sequentially - it doesn&apos;t take long to begin to<br/>recognize them as 2 distinct pitches. Admittedly, these are subtle<br/>kinds of effects that require a more delicate and minimal approach<br/>for the effect to perceived - but I just love this kind of listening<br/>experience. I guess my point was simply that, I observed that<br/>performers can work with cents. If it would be helpful, I will<br/>happily create a musical example for the Tuning Experiment page to<br/>demonstrate what the 6 cents sounds like. Of course this would be<br/>electronic, so would it have any value in this discussion about live<br/>performance?</p><p>Thanks,</p><p>Jacky Ligon</p></div><h3><a id=12295 href="#12295">ðŸ”—</a>Afmmjr@aol.com</h3><span>9/4/2000 8:13:34 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>There is no value to trying different notations of the same piece.
