Feedback loops of the audio kind would not work in the brain, as<br/>the brain, as you pointed out in your previous email, is a hypercomputer.<br/>But what COULD happen is a floating instability of the natural wave rhythms.<br/>The brain&apos;s electrical rhythms are designed to maintain synchrony between<br/>the different working areas; defects in this synchrony result in bizarre<br/>symptoms ranging from epilepsy to permanent autism, dylexia, and scotoma.<br/>It&apos;s like a parallel computer cable with one defective wire - because one<br/>bit per byte doesn&apos;t arrive, the rest of the data travelling through the<br/>computer is scrambled and unreadable. Biofeedback experiments have shown<br/>that the brain, on detecting a regular sensory rhythm (pulsing sound,<br/>regularly flashing light, etc) automatically shifts its own rhythms to avoid<br/>locking phase with the external one, to maintain its delicate internal<br/>synchrony. If the, say, flashing light is artificially synchronised with the<br/>brain&apos;s rhythm (using a biofeedback machine), the brain can&apos;t get its<br/>internal rhythm away from the external one - it can&apos;t desynchronise - and<br/>violent epilepsy results, even in a subject not prone to epilespy. This is<br/>why, as a stage musician, I will not allow my band to use disco strobes. And<br/>why I shall caution you in the use of biofeedback equipment for producing<br/>music. For the good of one&apos;s mental health, I would recommend limited use<br/>only of true biofeedback in brain-generated audio; a safer way would be to<br/>break the feedback loop by not permitting the subject to listen to the<br/>sounds in real time. Sorry about the lecture, but I thought it&apos;s a good time<br/>to raise this health issue. Yours, Keith.</p><p>Sarn Reply&apos;s:</p><p>And scitzophrenia, with LSD_25 type effects also-could explain the &quot;flashback&quot;<br/>phenominon that some people get on lysergic acid di-ethyl amide, and,<br/>also, some HIGHLY sensitive people who get &quot;marijuana flashbacks&quot;, these<br/>whilst not NEARLY as strong, or anywhere near as long term as the LSD ones<br/>can scare the individual.</p><p>Thus so, this may clearly illustrate the phenominon of &quot;chaos&quot; within the<br/>brain&apos;s<br/>chemistry,-a type of aperiodic non-linear behaviour exhibited in complex non-<br/>linear dynamical systems.</p><p>I&apos;m sure one could train themselves NOT to have epeliptic fits-and there may<br/>be, JUST<br/>may be, a &quot;vaccine efect&quot; in this, like the &quot;ear of the dog that niped you&quot;,<br/>you might be able to build up a tolerance to epilepsy-altho I&apos;m only guessing.</p><p>I still wounder about the effects of a rainbow colored strobe at different<br/>periods of light duration, e.g.:</p><p>  O    1    0      1    0   1    0     1   0   1<br/>|     | |        |    |    |  |      |    | |     | ------&gt;ect.....</p><p>       R           G         O         O      B</p><p>As for this so-called: &quot;lecture&quot;, GIVE ME MORE!!!!!!!!!!!</p><p>In real time, well, I always was an extremist.</p><p>It&apos;ll be hard NOT to stop me now, from going ahead and doing this!!!!!!</p><p>Anyway, I was thinking about &quot;trinary computers&quot;, using digital AND analogue<br/>switches, which each of the A/D dichotomy can be defined on each other in an<br/>endless circuit.</p><p>0, mabey, 1</p><p>0, 1/2, 1</p><p>Also, my &quot;Quiggle computers&quot;, whereby:</p><p>Bits information=2&amp;n, &amp;=All permutations of power sequence with their<br/>non-commutative propertys.</p><p>Thus, where n=....(x^(x^x)), we have:</p><p>     2&amp;5   2&amp;4     2&amp;3     2&amp;2      2&amp;1   2&amp;0<br/>           2^16       16        4        2     1/(2^(1/2))<br/>   =2^25536     =65536</p><p>&quot;Loads &apos;O room&quot;.</p><p>Mabey &quot;Quantum superpositional&quot;?????   :o)</p><p>Thanks for the feedback, Keith!!!!!</p><p>Looking foward for more!!!!!!!</p><p>Sarn &quot;Polyverse Philosopher&quot; Ursell.</p><p>P.S.</p><p>What about 3 way feedback?????</p></div>
