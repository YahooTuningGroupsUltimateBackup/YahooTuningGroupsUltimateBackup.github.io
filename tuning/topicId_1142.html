The plucked sounds seem to represent drops of water<br/>falling into underground pools, and the strings tell of that eerie dread<br/>one feels in a cave.</p><p>I like the way the plucks occupy the space between pitched and not<br/>pitched.  Well, on re-listening, I guess the pitch is pretty clear, but<br/>it seems diffused somehow - can you describe the makeup of this voice?</p><p>Oh... my mistake; you describe them as struck, not plucked!  OK, and I&apos;m<br/>vaguely hearing inharmonic partials in there, consistent with struck<br/>instruments.  You do something, though (tinker with the pitches during<br/>the (short) lifetime of the sound?) to make it sound like water drops.<br/>Hmmm... no, on listening again, I don&apos;t hear that, but it sure made me<br/>_imagine_ that I&apos;d heard it.</p><p>Caves are strange places.  Have you been to Carlsbad Caverns?  Majestic<br/>and frightening, very intense feeling walking down a steep path into the<br/>bowels of the earth.  Actually I can imagine playing your piece there,<br/>loud enough that people around can hear - I want to see their<br/>expressions!</p><p>JdL</p></div><h3><a id=1153 href="#1153">ðŸ”—</a>jpehrson@...</h3><span>11/13/2001 7:22:07 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In crazy_music@y..., &quot;X.
