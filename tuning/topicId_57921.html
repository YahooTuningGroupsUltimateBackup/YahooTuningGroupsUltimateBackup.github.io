I find 72 and 99 have a<br/>preliminary version of an ennealimmal notation system, with nine<br/>nominals (of course) going ABCDEFGHJ; why &quot;I&quot; is skipped is an<br/>interesting question. I don&apos;t understand the system, which does not<br/>seem to attach any importance to the generators 36/35, which gets a //<br/>or 21/20, which gets a #(. I presume George and Dave cooked this up.<br/>I&apos;d like to get a settled notation for ennealimmal, and then put 45000<br/>Fingers into an actual notated score, in whatever sense a seq file<br/>counts as a score. If we had ennealimmal notation also for 171, 441<br/>and 612 it would make a lot more sense, of course.</p><p>Beyond that, Pythagorean versions of 43, 50, 53, 55 and 94 would be nice.</p></div><h3><a id=57923 href="#57923">ðŸ”—</a>Gene Ward Smith &#x3C;gwsmith@svpal.org&#x3E;</h3><span>4/11/2005 2:28:02 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;Gene Ward Smith&quot; &lt;gwsmith@s...&gt; wrote:</p><p>&gt;I don&apos;t understand the system, which does not<br/>&gt; seem to attach any importance to the generators 36/35, which gets a //<br/>&gt; or 21/20, which gets a #(.</p><p>Sorry, I was looking at this cross-eyed or something.
