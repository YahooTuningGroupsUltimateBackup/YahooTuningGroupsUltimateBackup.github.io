Thus for an original organum at the fourth<br/>(the middle two voices of the following example), we have something like<br/>the following as one possibility for four voices (C4 is middle C, and<br/>since the notation is very pitch relative, a monastic community of women<br/>or men might have performed it at any convenient pitch):</p><p>Organal voice octave above   C4  D4  E4  C4  C4  B3  C4  D4  D4  C4<br/>Original chant               F3  G3  A3  F3  G3  E3  F3  G3  G3  F3<br/>Added organal voice          C3  D3  E3  C3  D3  B2  C3  D3  D3  C3<br/>Chant doubled octave below   F2  G2  A2  F2  G2  E2  F2  G2  G2  F2</p><p>This is indeed a very beautiful and imposing sound, and interestingly the<br/>range of around a twelfth is still noted as a usual practical limit for<br/>the size of vertical intervals by Jacobus of Liege about four centuries<br/>later.</p><p>Another source of this general era, in describing a concept like<br/>consonance or concord, says that it is what happens &quot;when men and boys<br/>sing the same thing,&quot; or &quot;in that which is called _organum_.&quot; The first<br/>reference seems to refer to the practice of octave doubling.</p><p>Guido, in his _Micrologus_ (c. 1030?), likewise describes how simple<br/>parallel organum or _diaphonia_ (literally &quot;singing apart&quot;) at the fourth<br/>can be expanded to three voices by adding a third voice at the octave<br/>above the lower one, producing a series of outer octaves with the fourth<br/>below and fifth above.</p><p>Around the 1280&apos;s, the theorist Elias Salamon (sp.?) likewise describes a<br/>mode of improvising for voices spaced at the fifth, octave, and twelfth,<br/>with a suggestion that there may have been some ornamentation (a possible<br/>inference of his advice that it not be overdone).</p><p>Around 1325, Jacobus of Liege gives an example of three voices singing in<br/>parallel octaves and fifteenths, referring to the wonderful unity of these<br/>intervals. As I recall, a similar example occurs in one of the early<br/>organum treatises.</p><p>In short, some of the same early treatises which describe polyphony in<br/>fifths and fourths also endorse octave doubling of parts to expand the<br/>texture. Other apparent references to the singing of people with different<br/>ranges in octaves (known also as _magadizing_ or the like) suggest that<br/>then, as now, this may have been a natural and common occurrence.</p><p>A quick comment about &quot;limits.&quot; As an exponent of medieval and<br/>neo-medieval polyphony based on a 3-limit of _stability_, I would<br/>emphasize that more complex intervals play a vital and often prominent<br/>role. Guido, for example, recommends the 9:8 major second as the best<br/>cadential approach to a unison, and Jacobus describes this interval as an<br/>&quot;imperfect concord.&quot; It is unstable, of course, but by no means<br/>unpleasant.</p><p>A 3-limit or Pythagorean tuning rapidly generates very complex ratios, and<br/>that&apos;s one of the delights of historical Gothic as well as neo-Gothic<br/>music.</p><p>The Renaissance not only shifts to stable 5-limit intervals but restricts<br/>intervals such as major seconds or minor sevenths in many ways by<br/>comparison with the 13th and 14th centuries. What we have is, in my view,<br/>not &quot;progress&quot; but a change in taste.</p><p>Complex 3-limit polyphony is a special art, as is the 5-limit polyphony of<br/>the Renaissance. As someone deeply drawn to both traditions, I would<br/>emphasize the beauty of each.</p><p>Most respectfully,</p><p>Margo Schulter<br/><a href="mailto:mschulter@value.net">mschulter@value.net</a></p></div>
