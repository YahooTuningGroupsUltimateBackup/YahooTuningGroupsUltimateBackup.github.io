In fact, my recent<br/>questions to Paul Erlich regarding some of the details of 72tET are<br/>for this very reason: I&apos;m interested in the musical results, not the<br/>modus operandi.

I&apos;m pretty clear on your<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; *own* opinion, however...<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; Really? You might be surprised . . .<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; OK... admittedly that comment was a bit simplistic...<br/>&gt;<br/>My own opinion is that, for my own artistic tastes, most of the interest is going to be found in<br/>NQJ (not-quite just) scales. The reason? Well, we know that all interesting scales are periodicity<br/>blocks. A periodicity block is defined by a set of (usually two or three, but sometimes one or<br/>four) unison vectors. If one of those 1-4 unison vectors is smaller than about 35 cents, it leads to<br/>&quot;wolves&quot; rather than musically useful inflections and should be tempered out. Larger unison<br/>vectors can either be tempered out as well (as in 15-tET and 26-tET), or can be left<br/>untempered (leading to MOS scales like the diatonic, symmetrical decatonic, 7- or 11-tone<br/>chain-of-minor thirds, blackjack, the various MOS scales Robert Valentine is working on, etc.).<br/>The only scales where strict JI would interest me are scales where all the unison vectors are<br/>larger than about 35 cents . . . can&apos;t think of any right now . . . let me get back to ya.</p></div><h3>Paul Erlich &#x3C;paul@stretch-music.com&#x3E;</h3><span>6/11/2001 5:08:17 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Whew . . .
