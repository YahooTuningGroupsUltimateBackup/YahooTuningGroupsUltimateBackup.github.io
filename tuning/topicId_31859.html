The<br/>description:</p><p>Novatone Intonational Systems: In 1978 a guitar designer named Tom Stone<br/>began manufacturing a guitar with interchangeable fretboards, allowing for<br/>exotic scales, meantone tuning (better in-tune than standard intonation),<br/>and more -- something unique at the time and even more unusual today.<br/>(Guitarist John Schneider continues to perform and record using this guitar<br/>system -- he appears on several LPs and CDs of microtonal music by such<br/>composers as Harry Partch and the like.) Novatone went bust<br/>I-don&apos;t-know-how-many-years ago. I bought the guitar when it was first<br/>offered, and continued to buy new fingerboards as Novatone brought them<br/>out, right up until the time they closed up shop. Nine fretboards come with<br/>the guitar: two equal temperament (i.e.; standard) fretboards (only one is<br/>pictured; the other was on the guitar at the time), two A meantones, two G<br/>meantones, one aluminum fretless fingerboard, one based on Japanese Koto<br/>tuning, and -- one of the coolest -- a fretboard called the &quot;Lou Harrison.&quot;<br/>Harrison was a close friend of hobo composer / microtonal theorist Harry<br/>Partch, and Harrison devised some unusual tuning systems of his own;<br/>Novatone based this fretboard on one of Harrison&apos;s scale designs. The<br/>fretboards can be changed without removing (or even detuning) the strings,<br/>and are held rigidly in place (magnetically) the full length of the<br/>fingerboard. To change them, you simply slide them sideways from under the<br/>strings. It takes all of about 10 seconds. To get an idea of what&apos;s being<br/>offered here take a gander at the scans -- I&apos;ve provided lots of them --<br/>and read the literature, which comes from various guitar magazines and<br/>newspapers of the time. It really is a remarkable and innovative<br/>instrument. I&apos;m not aware of any similar experimenting on a commercial<br/>level being done today. The guitar, case and five fretboards sold for<br/>$525.00 in the late &apos;70s. I purchased four additional fretboards beyond<br/>what came in the &quot;starter kit.&quot; (My overall investment was probably around<br/>a grand.) The guitar itself is a customized Takamine classical model<br/>EC132SC, one that Takamine still makes, apparently, and which retails for<br/>around $1300.00 new. With cutaway and active electronic pickup (volume,<br/>bass, treble slider controls), it&apos;s in fine overall shape; wear from my<br/>pinkie finger resting on the face of the guitar is the most notable<br/>imperfection. There are a few minor nicks, and the finish on the back of<br/>the guitar has taken on a slightly milky appearance as the guitar has aged.<br/>I&apos;ve tried to highlight these imperfections in my scans, but most are so<br/>minor they don&apos;t show up. The fingerboards are all in excellent shape,<br/>showing virtually no fretwear whatsoever (and I played them quite a bit!);<br/>the frets have held up every bit as well as conventional fretwire. The<br/>design works and the fretboards are tough as nails. The guitar plays fine,<br/>the action is low and everything you&apos;d expect from a decent classical<br/>guitar. Besides the guitar, its original hardshell case and all the<br/>fretboards you see here, the auction includes pages and pages of literature<br/>and instruction, and a press kit.</p><p>Cheers,<br/>Jon</p></div><h3><a id=31860 href="#31860">ðŸ”—</a>jdstarrett &#x3C;jstarret@carbon.cudenver.edu&#x3E;</h3><span>12/24/2001 8:48:08 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>&gt;Besides the guitar, its original hardshell case and all the<br/>&gt; fretboards you see here, the auction includes pages and pages of<br/>&gt;literature<br/>&gt; and instruction, and a press kit.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Cheers,<br/>&gt; Jon</p><p>What a bargain!

I<br/>still sell the accurate, computer generated printouts<br/>used as microtonal fretting guides, however, and I can<br/>connect you to a microtonal luthier who could<br/>construct new interchangeable fretboards for you if<br/>you don&apos;t want to do it yourself.</p><p>If the guitar sold at the eBay auction happens to have<br/>been made by Tom Stone&apos;s first company, Intonation<br/>Systems, it will be a Takamini classical guitar with<br/>an aluminum track in the neck and a complementary<br/>locking track on the back of each interchangeable<br/>fretboard.  About thirty of these instruments were<br/>made in the early 1980&apos;s.  I bought one of them and I<br/>still have it.  Unfortunately, I know of no source for<br/>new interchangeable fretboards for these instruments.</p><p>                         -- Mark Rankin</p><p>__________________________________________________<br/>Do You Yahoo!?<br/>Send your FREE holiday greetings online!<br/><a href="http://greetings.yahoo.com">http://greetings.yahoo.com</a></p></div><h3><a id=32289 href="#32289">ðŸ”—</a>paulerlich &#x3C;paul@stretch-music.com&#x3E;</h3><span>1/3/2002 7:58:58 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In tuning@y..., &quot;Dante Rosati&quot; &lt;dante.interport@r...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt; the auction ended:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; <a href="http://cgi.ebay.com/aw-cgi/eBayISAPI.dll?ViewItem&item=1400124680">http://cgi.ebay.com/aw-cgi/eBayISAPI.dll?ViewItem&item=1400124680</a><br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; i assumed &quot;22tones&quot; was Paul E., but then it looks like someone<br/>named<br/>&gt; &quot;paulpirate43&quot; slipped in and made the winning bid. was this Paul E<br/>too or<br/>&gt; did some &quot;pirate&quot; make off with the goods?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Dante</p><p>The pirate!
