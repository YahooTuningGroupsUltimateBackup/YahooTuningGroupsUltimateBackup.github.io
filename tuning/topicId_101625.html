I haven&apos;t been here in a couple of years. Picking up studies again. Hope all is well with everyone.</p><p>I have been reviewing the origins of the 12-tone system and the 7-tone diatonic scale. I am primarily using the book titled, &quot;Science and Music&quot; by Sir James Jeans first paperback edition 1961. The price on the front cover says, $1.95   Imagine that! The book is worth its weight in gold and it sold for $1.95. Amazing</p><p>Using the cycle of 5ths, I started with &quot;C&quot; and assigned to it the frequency of &quot;1&quot;. I multiplied &quot;C&quot; by 1.5 (1*1.5) and arrived at &quot;G&quot; which is 1.5. Them multiplied &quot;G&quot; by 1.5 (1.5*1.5) to arrive at &quot;D&quot; which results in 2.25</p><p>I continued on multiplying each 5th by 1.5 until I have arrived at the octave of &quot;C&quot;. See results for each step of the cycle of 5ths below please.</p><p>C - 1</p><p>G - 1.5</p><p>D Â– 2.25</p><p>A - 3.375</p><p>E Â– 5.0625</p><p>B Â– 7.59375</p><p>F# Â– 11.390625</p><p>C# - 17.085937</p><p>G# - 25.628905</p><p>Eb -  38.443357</p><p>Bb Â– 57.665035</p><p>F Â– 86.497552</p><p>C Â– 129.74632</p><p>Please help me to find the formula to reduce all the above frequencies to ONE OCTAVE. The answer should match the table on page 167 in the book, &quot;Science and Music&quot;. I&apos;m not sure what the proper term is for this procedure. The table lists the frequencies for the Pythagorean seven tone scale and its octave (all in one octave). The frequencies are listed below.</p><p>Pythagorean 7 Tone Scale</p><p>C   1/1 = 1.0000<br/>D   9/8 = 1.1250<br/>E   81/64 = 1.2656<br/>F   4/3 = 1.3333<br/>G   3/2 = 1.5000<br/>A   27/16 = 1.6875<br/>B   243/128 = 1.8984<br/>C   2/1 = 2</p><p>In other words, using the frequencies from the cycle of 5ths in the first table above, I start withÂ…</p><p>C   = 1.0000 (no problem)</p><p>C#  = from the cycle of 5ths list above, the &quot;C# &quot;would be equal to 17.0859. It&apos;s too large. It is way above &quot;2&quot; (the octave).</p><p>D  =  from the cycle of 5ths list above would be equal to 2.25. Still too large as it is greater than &quot;2&quot; (the octave). How do I reduce this &quot;D&quot; to 1.1250 as listed in the Pythagorean table above?</p><p>Etc. with the rest of the remaining chromatic frequencies listed in the first table above.</p><p>Thank you for your time<br/>Wally Lepore</p></div><h3><a id=101626 href="#101626">ðŸ”—</a>Mike Battaglia &#x3C;battaglia01@...&#x3E;</h3><span>9/13/2011 9:12:14 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>On Tue, Sep 13, 2011 at 12:06 PM, Wally &lt;soundmaker@...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Please help me to find the formula to reduce all the above frequencies to ONE OCTAVE.

They both start at 1.0 and end on 129.74632.  Have you looked upon this as a discrepancy?  For if you divide 129.74632 repeatedly by 2, you do not reach 1.0.  Please try it! and then try dividing 1.3515 by 1.3333 and see what you notice (that was what I meant in my previous response).  The two discrepancies are caused by the same thing.</p><p>Second, the note that is F#*3/2, I would not call Db but C#.  And so on (G#, D#, A#, E#) - IIRC you got this right in your previous message that I responded to.  This is good because it means that the (corrected) table above would not give two different values for F, but one for F and a different one for E#.</p><p>Third, have you tried starting from C and going in the opposite direction (i.e. dividing by 3/2 to get F, then again to get Bb, Eb, Ab, etc - note you then need to multiply repeatedly by 2 to get back to a number between 1 and 2)?</p><p>&gt;<br/>&gt; Pythagorean 7 Tone Scale<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; C 1/1 = 1.0000<br/>&gt; D 9/8 = 1.1250<br/>&gt; E 81/64 = 1.2656<br/>&gt; F 4/3 = 1.3515<br/>&gt; G 3/2 = 1.5000<br/>&gt; A 27/16 = 1.6875<br/>&gt; B 243/128 = 1.8984<br/>&gt; C 2/1 = 2<br/>&gt; My results above should have matched the table on page 167 in the book titled, &quot;Science and Music&quot; but they do not. ... Therefore, coming back to my original question, is there a misprint in the column (in the book) or am I missing something? Which is the correct answer for &quot;F&quot;,  1.3333 or 1.3515?</p><p>It is not a misprint.  My explanation for this is that the major scale starting on C, although it goes up from C in steps of 3/2 for the notes G, D, A, E, B, it goes down from C by 3/2 to get to F.  I&apos;m not sure I can explain why without getting into a debate.  One way to look at it is, if you start from F and play F, G, A, B, C, D, E, F as defined, it doesn&apos;t sound like a major scale; you &quot;need&quot; a Bb instead.  And how do you find the ratio of that Bb?  Why, you go another step in the &quot;downward&quot; direction from F.  And similarly, when starting from C, you need to include F (&quot;in the downward direction&quot;), and not F# (which would be B*3/2).  Also, have you considered that with your short table above, it would be a little odd to include the note E#=1.3515, while omitting other notes from the larger table (F#, Db, etc)?  For, as I said before, yours is not really F, but E#.</p><p>There is a lot more to all of this, e.g. Pythagorean tuning says E=81/64 but others say E=5/4.  Does the Jeans book go on to cover that?  And does it cover &quot;cents&quot;, as Keenan mentioned in your other thread?</p><p>Hope this helps,<br/>Steve M.</p></div>
