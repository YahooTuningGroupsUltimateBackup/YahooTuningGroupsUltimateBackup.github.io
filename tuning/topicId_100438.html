Anyway, the reason I ask about the younger vs older people thing is that my dad is very into music, and hates most of my microtonal stuff, but younger people I&apos;ve played it to that are also very into music love it. By knowledge do you mean listening experience and conditioning, or an actual academic knowledge of music? Because although my dad loves music, he doesn&apos;t have any theoretical knowledge about music, and he doesn&apos;t play an instrument.</p></div><h3><a id=100517 href="#100517">ðŸ”—</a>Tim Reeves &#x3C;reevest360@...&#x3E;</h3><span>7/3/2011 4:51:23 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Hi Gotta<br/>&nbsp;I&apos;ve been wondering many of the same things myself, but then I came to my senses when I heard &quot;She blinded me with Science&quot; on the radio...I began to think they may have slipped some microtones in there in places...also I&apos;m hearing more microtonality in music for film these days, and really, we may have all&nbsp;been hearing it for years in classical presentations<br/>Tim<br/>&nbsp;<br/>--- On Thu, 6/30/11, Gotta Love Septimal Minor Thirds &lt;microtonal76@...&gt; wrote:</p><p>From: Gotta Love Septimal Minor Thirds &lt;<a href="mailto:microtonal76@yahoo.com">microtonal76@yahoo.com</a>&gt;<br/>Subject: [tuning] How acessible is microtonal music?<br/>To: <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a><br/>Date: Thursday, June 30, 2011, 8:54 PM</p><p>Hello all.
