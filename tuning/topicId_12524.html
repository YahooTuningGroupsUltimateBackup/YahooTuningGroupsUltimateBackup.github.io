EMail me if<br/>you need it for Linux.<br/>When I read the tuning list on my Communicator I see the url&apos;s<br/>highlighted and they can be made to display in the browser only by<br/>clicking on the links.</p><p>Apologies again<br/>lucy</p><p>Charles Lucy - <a href="mailto:lucy@ilhawaii.net">lucy@ilhawaii.net</a>  (LucyScaleDevelopments)<br/>------------  Promoting global harmony through LucyTuning  -------<br/>for information on LucyTuning and free LucyTuned Lullaby mp3&apos;s<br/>go to <a href="http://www.ilhawaii.net/~lucy">http://www.ilhawaii.net/~lucy</a>  or <a href="http://www.harmonics.com/lucy/">http://www.harmonics.com/lucy/</a></p></div>
