The</p><p>&gt; results are depressingly close to 12-tET.&lt;&lt;</p><p>     This is interesting from a static standpoint,  but as far as drawing a<br/>value judgement inre the best tuning for this music, a basic assumption seems<br/>to have been made, and it is one that I cannot accept.  That is, that<br/>consonance is desirable to the point of exclusion of dissonance.  I think<br/>there is a place for beats (tempering), and their absence deprives music of<br/>an essential resource.<br/>   12 ET may give the lowest average amount of dissonance, but it doesn&apos;t<br/>necessarily make the best music.   The analysis that says ET was the most<br/>consonant tuning for the WTC doesn&apos;t account for the value of musical effects<br/>created by contrasting values of the tempering.  Are those important?  I say,<br/>&apos;Yes&quot;.</p><p>&gt; But when it comes to arguing which well-temperament is &quot;objectively</p><p>&gt; best&quot; for the WTC, I&apos;m sorry to report that they&apos;re all worse than</p><p>&gt; 12-tET by any rational measure I have seen to date.&lt;</p><p>    &quot;Any rational measure&quot;?  How about the consonance created by the prelude<br/>in Cmaj ( in any plausible tuning of 1722).  You can&apos;t achieve that sound in<br/>ET,  since the partials of the harmony are far away from the melodic line.<br/>And what about the stimulative quality of the prelude in C#?  In the<br/>Werckmeister, Kirnberger, or Young, you will have a harmonic value of the 20-<br/>21 cent third. This creates a sound that is unavailable in ET, and in direct<br/>comparisons,  every audience I have presented the choice to has favored the<br/>more highly tempered rendition.<br/>    There is nothing magic about 13.8 cent thirds,  they are simply the<br/>result of averaging the comma.  However, there is something lacking about the<br/>homoginized harmonic texture of ET that virtually any of the<br/>well-temperaments seem to musically provide.<br/>    There is also the consideration of the instrument,  in that the modern<br/>piano makes a 21 cent third a very busy interval, more so than a harpsichord<br/>of clavichord.  It is for this reason that I don&apos;t think  there is a &quot;proper&quot;<br/>temperament for Bach unless the instrument is specified, and even then, the<br/>subjective values take over.<br/>   Our &quot;Six Degrees&quot; CD included a 1/4 comma version of a Mozart piece( along<br/>with a well-tempered and ET version).  The wolf howls in this piece, makes<br/>the hair stand up on my neck, but there have been several correspondants that<br/>have written me to tell me that they really prefer the meantone sound.<br/>   There is a lot of room for taste when it comes to temperament,  but<br/>setting the value by the simple barometer of consonance misses out on the<br/>emotive-effective power of contrast.

I was<br/>responding to Herbert Anton Kellner&apos;s posts, which compare two<br/>well-temperaments, and which make the statement that one is measurably<br/>better than another.  My point is simply that we must use other<br/>criteria (historical clues and our own ears&apos; tastes) to make the<br/>decision of what tuning(s) to use.</p><p>JdL</p></div>
