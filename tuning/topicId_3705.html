One of my favorite CDs is Ocura C560027-28<br/>&gt; entitled l&apos;Eglise Orthodoxe Ethiopienne de Jerusalem. Besides being<br/>&gt; uncannily beautiful in a non western way (A preferance to a more nasal<br/>&gt; tone), it inspires me to make certain speculations as to how chant might<br/>&gt; on occasion could have been sung. Placed in a wide circle beneath a dome,<br/>&gt; a chant is started by one singer with others joining him with some delay<br/>&gt; so each line is heard &quot;in echo&quot; or multiple echoes. This &quot;imatation&quot;<br/>&gt; process works especially well musically and a composer could not help<br/>&gt; being drawn to play with the possibilities. I only bring it up to point<br/>&gt; out that one of the scales, of which there are two (pentatonics),<br/>&gt; contains  intervals close to a semitones. B C Eb Gb G B C. (I tend not to<br/>&gt; guess at the intonations of things when I sence I am hearing it through<br/>&gt; whatever tuning i am working with at the moment). The entire scale rings<br/>&gt; as a chord. The chant like &quot;rythumn&quot; places it as having enough<br/>&gt; simularity to our common chant for me to hear it as an influence on other<br/>&gt; chant or from a common source.  about 10 years ago I experimented with<br/>&gt; taking a solo chant record and overdubbing it out of sync and found it to<br/>&gt; work quite well. Possibly some of thisd music might have been chosen or<br/>&gt; composed with this possibility in mind. Anyone Familiar with this<br/>&gt; recording!</p><p>-- Kraig Grady<br/>North American Embassy of Anaphoria Island<br/><a href="http://www.anaphoria.com">http://www.anaphoria.com</a></p></div>
