I&apos;m sure there are principles that good blues<br/>intonation obeys, but I&apos;m not sure how far they would go to<br/>explain anything.  I mean, the blues scale is one such principle,<br/>but it&apos;s kind of just a tetrachordal scale based on a minor<br/>tetrachord.  There&apos;s not much more to it.  There&apos;s nothing in<br/>the scale itself that would make you think it would be the basis<br/>of a musical institution.  There are cultural reasons involved.</p><p>That said, I think there is a definite tendency to hang out<br/>south of the normal minor third, especially over the IV, where<br/>7/6 would surely tend to draw you in.  But I don&apos;t hear much<br/>JI locking in blues performances, perhaps because the notes<br/>are always sliding around.</p><p>Actually, Martin Braun has suggested that slides are especially<br/>interesting to the human nervous system, based on his study<br/>of neurophysiology, and lately I&apos;ve been thinking he was right.<br/>So maybe slides are actually the main ingredient of blues.</p><p>-Carl</p></div>
