Is it possible that offset got compounded with offset at<br/>&gt;times?</p><p>I listened to the pieces on John&apos;s website and everything sounds great.<br/>Could you specify the piece, minutes, seconds, so I can compare how it comes<br/>out on my machine?</p></div><h3>Paul H.

For b-b-b, I find:</p><p>&gt;b-b-bjcs5.mid: Bend range applied: -14.0707 to  14.0739<br/>&gt;b-b-bjes2.mid: Bend range applied: -16.7419 to  15.1923<br/>&gt;b-b-bjcs7.mid: Bend range applied: -18.6853 to  18.7531</p><p>&gt;Notice how much more deviation the &quot;no tuning file&quot; version has than<br/>&gt;the original 5-limit tuning!  This is due, no doubt, to what has to<br/>&gt;happen when two minor thirds, each targeting almost 16 cents more than<br/>&gt;12-tET, are stacked together.  The tritone thus formed targets an<br/>&gt;interval more than 31 cents wider than 12-tET, pushing the deviations<br/>&gt;accordingly.</p><p>&gt;I&apos;m coming to think that, in spite of the desirable purity of the minor<br/>&gt;thirds in the &quot;no tuning file&quot; versions, the original 5-limit tunings<br/>&gt;are superior because they have less horizontal motion.</p><p>John, don&apos;t confuse deviations from 12-tET with horizontal motion. For<br/>example, a 12-tone 1/4-comma meantone tuning will have even larger<br/>deviations from 12-tET, but absolutely _no_ horizontal motion.</p></div><h3>Paul H.
