To tell you<br/>the truth, I have had extreme difficulty in attempting to discern the<br/>differences between Kalle&apos;s ultimate and my own ultimate WT.

A brief evaluation of<br/>the Pros and Cons of these two competitors are as follows:</p><p>Kalle&apos;s Ultimate Proportional Beating WT<br/>|<br/>PROS</p><p>1. Seven limit beat ratios at every tonality; extremely clean-looking.<br/>2. Simple pitch ratios.<br/>3. No harmonic waste; no wider-than-pure fifths.</p><p>CONS</p><p>1. Too many pure fifths invalidating the proportionality of triadic<br/>beat ratios (at 12 keys).<br/>2. Cannot be tuned by ear, complex beat frequencies.<br/>3. One too narrow fifth that deviates from pure by nearly 7 cents.<br/>4. Not too successful at approximating 5-limit JI at common keys; not<br/>enough key-colour.</p><p>______________________________________</p><p>And now, Dr. Oz.&apos;s Ultimate Proportional Beating WT<br/>|<br/>PROS</p><p>1. Simple integer beat frequencies at concert pitch.<br/>2. Tunable by ear by just counting the beating (once or twice per<br/>sec.) of the fifths from pure.<br/>3. Simple pitch ratios.<br/>4. Successful at completing the circle of fifths with no more than 5 cents maximum absolute deviation.<br/>5. Only 6 keys where the pure fifth spoils the proportionality of<br/>triadic beat ratios.<br/>6. Wide fifths only as wide as 2 cents from pure.<br/>7. Clean approach to simulating 5-limit JI at common keys; good key-<br/>contrast.<br/>8. High prime brats in only 8 keys.</p><p>CONS</p><p>1. 19-limit brats not so simple; remainder numbers (m3/M3) not<br/>following a clean pattern in 3 keys.<br/>2. Harmonic waste, however small.<br/>3.

A brief evaluation of the Pros and Cons of these two<br/>&gt;&gt; competitors are as follows:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; One difference is that Kalle&apos;s WT has no fifths sharper than pure,<br/>&gt; and therefore the total error of the major thirds is lower.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; -Carl<br/>&gt;</p></div><h3><a id=89132 href="#89132">ðŸ”—</a>Carl Lumma &#x3C;carl@...&#x3E;</h3><span>5/11/2010 7:07:09 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, Ozan Yarman &lt;ozanyarman@...&gt; wrote:</p><p>&gt; Kalle&apos;s Ultimate Proportional Beating WT<br/>&gt; |<br/>&gt; PROS<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; 3.

For example right after when I ran into Ptolemy&apos;s Homalon scale I asked Jacques directly if my ratios matched an existing scale and he found that match.  And, of course, I never claimed that one scale I ran into was original by me since.<br/>   When I created my 7-tone or so PHI Sections scale generated by (1/PHI)^x + 1 there was no scale it fell under but a PHI tuning well over 20 tones...equating those would be like saying the diatonic scale and 12TET are the same because one fits within the other (IE not very reasonable).  Same situation though...after I made the scale I asked people if they knew an exact copy immediately...but no one did, they only knew much larger tunings generated by completely different methods which just happened to A) use PHI B) include my scale among tons of other notes (some of them even included infinite numbers of notes generating a huge loop).</p><p>&gt;&quot;It seems that the main purpose of this list is to share information about tunings.&quot;<br/>   Right, so where&apos;s the part where you supposedly can&apos;t<br/>A) Share your own tuning<br/>B) Check it with experts on this list against existing material<br/>C) Regardless of whether it does/doesn&apos;t exist, share more about it...for example even though I ran into Ptolemy&apos;s tuning system I explained &quot;what I like about Ptolemy&apos;s tuning system which made me run into it&quot;.</p><p>   You know I actually at one point suggested this group be split into a historical and modern/&quot;about new scales or at least trying to find new scales&quot; group.

It&apos;s called &quot;Smack My Pitch Up&quot; (Cameron&apos;s name idea) and you&apos;re sure to hear about it in the near future.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp; Realize it&apos;s a tough struggle: Jacky Ligon (a fantastic musician) who also made original/new scales and culminated his efforts in incredibly good original/new sounding music apparently gave up forums and albums supposedly due to their blatant ignorance toward completely new tunings (good job guys?!). :-(&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Meanwhile I don&apos;t just sit around and say my scales are &quot;done&quot;, I constantly tweak them, measure them with various psycho-acoustic and mathematical/ computer- program tests to optimize them.&nbsp; This is why only now I&apos;m concentrating on music...because now I know my main tuning<br/> theory called &quot;Infinity&quot; finally has all notes within 10 cents of forming their ideal intervals with all other notes in the scale.&nbsp; And, I&apos;ve learned through testing in composition. ..it finally for the most part nails the definition of &quot;an incredibly easy to play 7-tone-or-more scale where it&apos;s impossible to hit a sour chord no matter how large or small&quot;.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp; Now both of Jacky Ligon and our *should be censored?* :-D original scales are on the album...and I&apos;m confident you&apos;ll be pleasantly surprised by the odd combination of extra tonal flexibility and 12TET-or-better consonance (goals aimed toward public acceptance) achieved with both. :-)</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Let&apos;s check back in on this after you hear the album.&nbsp; Then we&apos;ll re-convene about whether this quest for original scales and their role in popularizing micro-tonal music is such a bad idea. :-)</p><p>-Michael</p></div><h3><a id=89244 href="#89244">ðŸ”—</a>Michael &#x3C;djtrancendance@...&#x3E;</h3><span>5/15/2010 6:48:05 PM</span><button style="float: right;

Nowhere did I claim that there was any &quot;hypocrisy&quot; involved; that is your invention, which you are attributing to me.  I reject your claim.&quot;</p><p>    Well before you had said...<br/>George&gt;&quot;I&apos;ve seen you claim to be attacked when people criticize you, and now the claim of censorship comes up.&quot;<br/>    Not quite sure what you were trying to say: your above statement does seem to say I&apos;m labeling myself as being attacked and then &quot;censored&quot;.  I&apos;m taking this back to the topic of tuning and saying this is &gt;not&lt; a problem of my being attacked, but an issue with a common attitude on the tuning list.  When I said<br/>Me&gt;&quot;The<br/>nasty response to Jacky&apos;s 12/11 9/8 12/11 tuning being slapped the<br/>label &quot;Mojira&quot; (sp?) on being yet another classic example of this<br/>problem.&quot;<br/>  ...I was trying to make it utterly clear that it seems your claim (and many other people&apos;s) is that those who try to make original scales are working toward a fairly pointless goal.  Jacky isn&apos;t even on the list...and yet his scale was shot down...if that isn&apos;t an example of  &quot;non-personal&quot; censorship than I don&apos;t know what could be more so a case of that.</p><p>George&gt;&quot;Secondaly, censorship involves an organization preventing publication of material or redacting controversial passages&quot;</p><p>    But surely, that has been done on this list...a lot.<br/>    Rick Ballan was blamed for &quot;practicing pseudo-science&quot; with his GCD theories and then had his theories restated as &quot;simply another way to describe the commonly accepted theory of virtual pitch&quot;.  He actually took himself off the list, much like Jacky did, citing the lack of people taking him seriously and mis-interpreting his theories as the reason.  Only much later did a few people realize he really was working on something distinct from virtual pitch.  And, IMVHO, having your theory labeled as invalid by many known experts in the field after publishing has much the same effect as its &quot;not being allowed to be published&quot;. So how &quot;correct&quot; my use of the word &quot;censorship&quot; is...is not relevant since the overall effect is so similar.</p><p>George&gt;&quot;And when people criticize a point you have made, they are not censoring you.&quot;<br/>     At best, they are censoring the point.  But, let me again state, the point started NOT with the issue of me but with the response to JACKY&apos;S SCALE.  And I am not Jacky, get it?   The other thing is there&apos;s a huge rift between constructive criticism...which always indicates ways to improve the result without giving up.  You appear to be implying simply giving up, and that is NOT constructive criticism.<br/>    In fact I&apos;m under the impression you are taking this route of mis-labeling your attempt at invalidating the point of new/original scales as constructive criticism...because if you didn&apos;t add that lie to the equation your point wouldn&apos;t be strong enough to compete.  To compete with the fact that Rick Ballan, Charles Lucy, Marcel, Jacky Ligon, and (even) Jacques Dudon have at many times had there theories &quot;rounded to the nearest historical version&quot;, mis-interpreted, and then cast off as &quot;invalid&quot; without any hint of constructive criticism.<br/>   That, my friend, is not primarily if at all problem with my or anyone else who creates scales &quot;chips on their shoulders&quot;...but an issue that in many ways ensures any attempts to do anything highly original in the micro-tonal world are shot down rather than worked with and improved to the point of helping micro-tonality.</p><p>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>   The only chip on my shoulder I have...is that the community in general seems to have a tough time embracing change and perhaps realizing that not all the ideas you are taught in things like Doctorate-level education may be the only good answers.<br/>&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;</p><p>    I just hope tuning, as an artistic community, becomes more welcoming and respecting of innovation in general.</p><p>_,_._,___</p></div><h3><a id=89299 href="#89299">ðŸ”—</a>Ozan Yarman &#x3C;ozanyarman@...&#x3E;</h3><span>5/17/2010 3:50:35 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Dear Andreas,</p><p>&#x2729; &#x2729; &#x2729;<br/><a href="http://www.ozanyarman.com">www.ozanyarman.com</a></p><p>On May 14, 2010, at 2:48 PM, a_sparschuh wrote:</p><p>&gt; --- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, Ozan Yarman &lt;ozanyarman@...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt; ... the 524th harmonic series utilizing many ratios<br/>&gt;&gt; ... with a common 131   denominator similar to my UWT....<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Dear Oz,<br/>&gt; it is always again amazing how completely different<br/>&gt; ansatzes do lead later to similar solutions.<br/>&gt; Hence, please understand my &quot;congratulation&quot; exclusively<br/>&gt; as an sober-minded compliment.<br/>&gt;</p><p>Many thanks for that.</p><p>&gt;&gt; Having settled that issue,<br/>&gt;&gt; let me say that your approach involving 13-<br/>&gt;&gt; limit brats and no harmonic waste, which can be tuned by ear via<br/>&gt;&gt; simply listening to the beats per sec. of fifths from pure is a<br/>&gt;&gt; fabulous solution!<br/>&gt; You are in deed the first person,<br/>&gt; who reckognized that hidden integral-feature,<br/>&gt; how it works.<br/>&gt;</p><p>Indeed?

A polynomial such as the mohajira generator polynomial x^5 - x^4 - 1/2 which has all dyadic rational number coefficients and a coefficient on the highest power of 1 is like a monic polynomial and its roots are like algebraic integers outside of the prime 2, and that makes a difference with the recurrence relationships with the polynomial as characteristic function as well as with the scales using the root itself as a generator, as the major thirds and fifths<br/>are now like integers or algebraic integers.</p><p>So the upshot is, there&apos;s some point to making scale elements into &quot;dyadic integers&quot;, or &quot;dyadic algebraic integers&quot; (calling Z_(2) the dyadic integers) instead of just any old rational number.</p></div><h3><a id=89382 href="#89382">ðŸ”—</a>George Sanders &#x3C;georgesanders11111@...&#x3E;</h3><span>5/19/2010 2:58:16 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Dear Mr.Sparchuh (I&apos;m sorry, but I don&apos;t know your first name)&nbsp;Well, then, we agree that the word &quot;originality&quot; has some meaning in the real world. &nbsp;I have a problem, though, when people define it in such a restrictive manner that it is impossible to find an example in the world of anything original. &nbsp;But this would be a vacuous definition.

When it says &quot;based on the work of others&quot;...that could refer to either, for example, the work&apos;s actually being copied and/or based on other people&apos;s ideas.</p><p>  The latter is definitely false...even the most new and novel ideas have some sort of historical pre-cursor...although some have far less than others.  You can even say Henry Ford&apos;s Model T car was not original because it used wheels and an engine...both of which existed far before the Model T.  Or that any piece of music is &quot;not original&quot; because it uses the same scale or chords as many other pieces.  It&apos;s...indeed far too strict a qualification for being original.</p><p>  I&apos;d vouch to say something original must be significantly different and uniquely useful(or, at times, useless) in contrast to predecessors.  For example, to gain a patent an idea has to pass a number of people&apos;s votes as to being significantly different from the most closely related ideas in existence.<br/>  Meanwhile so far as things such as musical works (in which subjectivity among listeners plays a huge role)...it seems fair to say music that&apos;s considered original achieves either moods or techniques recognized by many people as uniquely useful.  For example, Debussy&apos;s use of transposition within verses creates a unique new sense of open-ness while maintaining a single-key sense of balanced resolve.  If someone made a style of music which made people lose balance...it would still be original...just in a &quot;uniquely useless&quot; way. :-D</p><p>   So being &quot;original&quot;, I&apos;d vouch...doesn&apos;t necessarily mean &quot;well liked&quot; either...it much more so means it does something that, in many ways, has not been done before.</p><p>  For a scale to qualify as original one must ask, for example, what that scale can do (or what multiple things it can acheive simultaneously) that other tunings can&apos;t.  And of course mathematically original and original &quot;when played&quot; are two different things as many people can&apos;t hear slight mathematical optimizations.<br/>  I&apos;d actually say it&apos;s easy to make an original scale far as using different math and/or having a distinct combination of dyadic intervals...but hard to make one that&apos;s original in many ways at once and different enough from existing scales to be easily recognized audibly as different...and not just mathematically.</p><p>-Michael</p></div><h3><a id=89409 href="#89409">ðŸ”—</a>Chris Vaisvil &#x3C;chrisvaisvil@...&#x3E;</h3><span>5/20/2010 12:23:18 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Sure lets gets back on topic.</p><p>Here is a version of Moonlight Sonata&apos;s 1st movement orchestrated<br/>using your Ultimate Well Temperament tuning</p><p><a href="http://notonlymusic.com/board/download/file.php?id=242">http://notonlymusic.com/board/download/file.php?id=242</a></p><p>Scored for harp, flute, french horns, trombones, tuba.

original work is one not received from others nor one copied based on<br/> the work of others.&quot; -<br/><a href="http://en.wikipedia">http://en.wikipedia</a> .org/wiki/ Originality</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp; I see how this article is up to easy misinterpretation.&nbsp; When it says &quot;based on the work of others&quot;...that could refer to either, for example, the work&apos;s actually being copied and/or based on other people&apos;s ideas.</p><p>&nbsp; The latter is definitely false...even the most new and novel ideas have some sort of historical pre-cursor.. .although some have far less than others.&nbsp; You can even say Henry Ford&apos;s Model T car was not original because it used wheels and an engine...both of which existed far before the Model T.&nbsp; Or that any piece of music is &quot;not original&quot; because it uses the same scale or chords as many other pieces.&nbsp; It&apos;s...indeed far too strict a qualification for being original.</p><p>&nbsp; I&apos;d vouch to say something original must be significantly different and uniquely useful(or, at<br/> times, useless) in contrast to predecessors.&nbsp; For example, to gain a patent an idea has to pass a number of people&apos;s votes as to being significantly different from the most closely related ideas in existence.<br/>&nbsp; Meanwhile so far as things such as musical works (in which subjectivity among listeners plays a huge role)...it seems fair to say music that&apos;s considered original achieves either moods or techniques recognized by many people as uniquely useful.&nbsp; For example, Debussy&apos;s use of transposition within verses creates a unique new sense of open-ness while maintaining a single-key sense of balanced resolve.&nbsp; If someone made a style of music which made people lose balance...it would still be original...just in a &quot;uniquely useless&quot; way. :-D</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp; So being &quot;original&quot;, I&apos;d vouch...doesn&apos; t necessarily mean &quot;well liked&quot; either...it much more so means it does something that, in many ways, has not been done<br/> before.</p><p>&nbsp; For a scale to qualify as original one must ask, for example, what that scale can do (or what multiple things it can acheive simultaneously) that other tunings can&apos;t.&nbsp; And of course mathematically original and original &quot;when played&quot; are two different things as many people can&apos;t hear slight mathematical optimizations.<br/>&nbsp; I&apos;d actually say it&apos;s easy to make an original scale far as using different math and/or having a distinct combination of dyadic intervals... but hard to make one that&apos;s original in many ways at once and different enough from existing scales to be easily recognized audibly as different... and not just mathematically.</p><p>-Michael</p><p>    __._,</p><p>&lt;!--<br/>#yiv2115822370 #ygrp-mkp {<br/>border:1px solid
