He belonged to a<br/>family which hailed from Kashmir. His grandfather, Bhaskara, a<br/>scholar-physician, migrated from Kashmir to Devagiri (present<br/>Daulatabad), some time in the twelfth century. The<br/>text, &apos;sangitaratnakara&apos;, consists of seven chapters -- the first six<br/>on music, and the seventh on dance.  You may access the English<br/>translation (by me) of parts of &apos;sangitaratnakara&apos; in a series, on<br/>the web site<br/><a href="http://sanskrit.forums.bhaarat.com/">http://sanskrit.forums.bhaarat.com/</a></p><p>Second: Yes; Sa-Re-Ga-Ma-Pa-Dha-Ni-Sa  is the Indian equivalent of Do-<br/>Re-Mi-Fa-Sol-La-Ti-Do.  But the difference is that Indian system is a<br/>5-limit JI system -- not a tempered scale.  The tonic, the frequency<br/>of reference, may be anywhere on the frequency continuum. For<br/>convenience and consistency in reporting, however, the key &apos;C&apos; is<br/>often taken to be the &apos;Sa&apos;, the tonic (as Jacky has done). In this<br/>case, again, most of the notes of Indian music will lie in<br/>the &quot;crevices&quot; of the piano keyboard. Only the fourth, Ma, and the<br/>fifth, Pa, are close to the 12-teT scale.</p><p>Thanks,<br/>Haresh.</p></div><h3><a id=28945 href="#28945">ðŸ”—</a>manuel.op.de.coul@eon-benelux.com</h3><span>10/8/2001 2:27:11 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>This might interest you too:<br/>Thornley Head, Phineas de; et al.<br/>_Synaesthesia and Pitch-Colour Isomorphism in Three Dimensional RGB Space_.<br/>BSc thesis, University of Southampton, 1999.<br/><a href="http://phinland.net/Works/Papers/syn99.html">http://phinland.net/Works/Papers/syn99.html</a></p><p>Manuel</p></div><h3><a id=28962 href="#28962">ðŸ”—</a>Paul Erlich &#x3C;paul@stretch-music.com&#x3E;</h3><span>10/8/2001 2:22:13 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In tuning@y..., &quot;Haresh BAKSHI&quot; &lt;hareshbakshi@h...&gt; wrote:</p><p>&gt; Second: Yes; Sa-Re-Ga-Ma-Pa-Dha-Ni-Sa  is the Indian equivalent of<br/>Do-<br/>&gt; Re-Mi-Fa-Sol-La-Ti-Do.

In fact,<br/>that is THE point.</p><p>Such situations arise far too frequently, and need to be treated most<br/>thoroughly.  If necessary, we should come up with and enunciate a<br/>principle which will try to eliminate arbitrariness in a major way. I<br/>tried exactly this, by presenting &quot;Heisenberg&apos;s Principle of<br/>Indeterminancy to Indian classical music&quot; in message #28557, on<br/>September the 24th.  Let us apply this principle to the question<br/>under consideration.</p><p>Here, the ideal, during the performance, is to attain the frequency<br/>of the &apos;performed&apos; note as close as possible, to the requirement of<br/>the target temperament.  That is the THEORY.  Any performer should<br/>have the calibre to achieve this ideal in the laboratory conditions,<br/>which, almost, do exist on the stage, when a performer completes the<br/>dynamic part of his performance and decides to &apos;stay&apos; on the<br/>targetted note.</p><p>During the dynamic part of his performance, he is close to, and<br/>around, his targetted note -- if he were to be exactly ON the note at<br/>that juncture, the beauty of the dynamics (alankara-s, gamaka-s, etc)<br/>would be lost entirely.  When he is through with the dynamic passage,<br/>he chooses to resolve the aesthetic tension he created previously<br/>through dynamics -- by standing on the targetted note.  But, this<br/>time his performed note should sound in the ideal frequency.</p><p>The next question is:  How far, +/- in cents, should the deviation<br/>from the ideal frequency, be considered tolerable? The answer is:<br/>This will depend upon both the performer and the listener, as well<br/>as on the cultural origin of the music being performed. As you have<br/>remarked, any difference of +/- upto, arbitrarily and generally, of,<br/>say, 4-12 cents, should sound tolerable in many cases. How do I<br/>know this? -- I do NOT!</p><p>Here, I am reminded of the raga Marwa (on which we have exchanged<br/>views, though in a different context, during one of our off-list<br/>discussions).  How low should we sing the komal Re (Db) in Marwa?<br/>The answer, perhaps a little unexpected, is: as low as you want Marwa<br/>to sound plaintive -- the more sorrowful you want Marwa to sound, the<br/>lower the komal Re, which you reach by meend from Ga (so it is<br/>dynamic). This is a typical case of flexibility, not arbitrariness.</p><p>To sum up: No tolerance for steady notes; some small, arbitrary and<br/>variable tolerance during the dynamic treatment.  This seems to be a<br/>good, working, starting point.</p><p>This, I believe, will apply, to cross-cultural musical projects, too.<br/>Here, the simultaneous existence of more than one temperament will<br/>create some &quot;roughness&quot; in the in the performance.  But this,<br/>hopefully, would be more than taken care of, by the novelty and<br/>quality of the performance.</p><p>Regards,<br/>Haresh.</p></div>
