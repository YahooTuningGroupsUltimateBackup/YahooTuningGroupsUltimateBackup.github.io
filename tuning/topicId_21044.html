Well, for one thing,<br/>several of the theorists we have been discussing on this list are<br/>appearing in Knud Jeppesen&apos;s _Counterpoint_.  The names include,<br/>Zarlino, Vicentino and, later of course, Kirnberger.  I didn&apos;t<br/>realize that Kirnberger was a rather &quot;slavish&quot; follower of Johann<br/>Sebastian Bach...</p><p>So, ALL of these theorists discussed counterpoint in addition to<br/>tuning.  My guess is that this was not so unusual for the time.  Why<br/>wouldn&apos;t a theoretical thinker about music consider both the<br/>underlying pitch structure as well as ways of making a<br/>musical continuity?</p><p>Is it perhaps only in our OWN age where our tuning system is SO<br/>INGRAINED that theoriticians (and composers in some cases) like Forte<br/>and Babbitt so ASSUME the system that they have no interest in<br/>tuning?? (John Clough being a laudable exception to the &quot;no tuning&quot;<br/>theorist rule...)</p><p>Immediately looking at it, it is clear that the Jeppesen counterpoint<br/>book is MUCH closer to the Palestrina style than Fux...  There are<br/>full extracts of passages from Palestrina in it, and even the<br/>&quot;species&quot; studies look more like Palestrina than the abstract Fux.<br/>The book is interesting just from THAT standpoint alone...<br/>particularly evident is the rhythmic variety in the counterpoint,<br/>which is &quot;downplayed&quot; by Fux in the interest of facile tutelage.</p><p>So what is the drawback to Jeppesen?  Well, the other book that came<br/>from <a href="http://Amazon.com">Amazon.com</a> was the Salzer and Schachter __Counterpoint in<br/>Composition__ which I had heard about for a long time, but had never<br/>seen.  This work proceeds with analysis of counterpoint from a<br/>Heinrich Schenkerian point of view.</p><p>According to Salzer and Schachter, Jeppesen&apos;s narrow insistence on<br/>the study of counterpoint from one particular style, the style of<br/>Palestrina, is flawed.  They feel that the Johann Joseph Fux work is<br/>superior in this regard in that it is more ABSTRACT and is more<br/>generally applicable.  This, of course, would certainly fit in with<br/>the Schenkerian approach which is, also, an abstract reduction of<br/>musical passages.</p><p>ON THE OTHER HAND, composer Walter Piston in his own __Counterpoint__<br/>feels that the SCHENKERIAN approach to the subject, proposed by<br/>Salzer and Schachter is wrong.  He feels that counterpoint is such a<br/>&quot;surface&quot; study, and the linear DETAILS are so important that<br/>subjecting them to Schenkerian reduction is uninforming...</p><p>So far, Salzer and Schachter have to convince me, also, of the<br/>Schenkerian approach.  The book is mighty &quot;purdy&quot; though... it&apos;s<br/>&quot;aspect ratio&quot; is unusually wide (horizontal) and short (vertically)<br/>just like counterpoint should be!</p><p>So, Salzer and Schachter dump Jeppesen and Piston, in turn, dumps<br/>Salzer and Schachter.  What a poignant party of counterpoints!</p><p>________ ______ _____ ___<br/>Joseph Pehrson</p></div><h3><a id=21107 href="#21107">ðŸ”—</a>Paul H.
