Here&apos;s a quieter replay:</p><p>&gt;  &gt; Gann writes that a 680-cent fifth sounds &quot;scary.&quot;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;  if this is indeed an overarching assessment, made without context,<br/>&gt;  then this is certainly a piece of dogma i can&apos;t agree with. nor, i&apos;m<br/>&gt;  sure, would many just intonation practitioners -- kraig grady in<br/>&gt;  particular loves to use this interval.</p><p>Pardon me for intruding at this late date to correct misapprehensions that have been drawn, not only from individual phrases taken out of context of my writings, but individual words. A misconclusion has arisen, in the context of the controversy raised by Julia Werntz, that because I describe the &quot;wolf&quot; fifth 40/27 as &quot;scary,&quot; I therefore dogmatically forbid its use in music. This is a groundless and arbitrary inference. I use 40/27 in my music myself; the third movement of my opera Custer and Sitting Bull is soaked in it. I am fascinated by JI dissonances, as my recent article on my music in 1/1 attests. I do hear a very different quality in 40/27 than I do in 3/2, and I capitalize on such differences when I compose, choosing intervals precisely for their inherent qualities. In my web site&apos;s &quot;Just Intonation Explained&quot; page, written as an introduction for beginners, I describe the 40/27 interval, isolated from context and compared to 3/2, as &quot;scary,&quot; just as someone writing an introduction to harmony for nonmusicians might describe the diminished seventh chord as &quot;anxious.&quot; I stand by the statement as it appears in its original context, but not as removed from context and transformed into sweeping philosophical dogma by the ever-creative members of the tuning list.</p><p>Yours,</p><p>Kyle Gann</p></div><h3><a id=40821 href="#40821">ðŸ”—</a>Jon Szanto &#x3C;JSZANTO@ADNC.COM&#x3E;</h3><span>11/12/2002 7:58:49 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Kyle,</p><p>--- In tuning@y..., Kyle Gann &lt;kgann@e...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt; Sorry about the screaming large print in the previous e-mail</p><p>No excuses. :)</p><p>&gt; I do hear a very different quality in 40/27 than I do in<br/>&gt; 3/2, and I capitalize on such differences when I compose, choosing<br/>&gt; intervals precisely for their inherent qualities.</p><p>Indeed.</p><p>&gt; I stand by the statement as it appears in its<br/>&gt; original context, but not as removed from context and transformed<br/>&gt; into sweeping philosophical dogma by the ever-creative members of<br/>&gt; the tuning list.</p><p>At least they&apos;re creative!
