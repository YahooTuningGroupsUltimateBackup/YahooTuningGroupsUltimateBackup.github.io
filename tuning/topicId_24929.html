I wouldn&apos;t mind posting something and I dont<br/>really feel like making a web page to upload it to. Plus I would like to talk<br/>about a tunng system I recently used in the music, but it wont make much<br/>sense to people with out hearing it I bet. Although ... I suppose it might<br/>not make much sense after hearing it either. hehe :)</p><p>Andy</p></div><h3>Paul Erlich &#x3C;paul@stretch-music.com&#x3E;</h3><span>6/12/2001 12:01:32 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In tuning@y..., JoJoBuBu@a... wrote:</p><p>&gt; Is there anywhere centralized where members here post sound files<br/>of their<br/>&gt; music to share with the group?

I initially joined because I wanted<br/>to learn a way to tune my Siyotanka(Lakota flutes)to something other<br/>than a european paradigm. I have since quit tuning my flutes at all and<br/>just stick to certain templates I have made. I make these flutes out of<br/>pvc a cork pretty much. I play my flutes focusing upon overblow, as our<br/>flutes used to be played far differently prior to the dominant cultures<br/>appropriation of our flutes. Anyway, I would appreciate feedback. I<br/>know nothing about &quot;music&quot; cant write/read it or play an instrument.<br/>thanks.
