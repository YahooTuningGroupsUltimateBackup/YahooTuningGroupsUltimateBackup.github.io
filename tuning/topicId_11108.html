The neo-Gothic region and R<br/>--------------------------------</p><p>Our survey suggests one possible definition for the neo-Gothic<br/>spectrum as the portion of the continuum of regular tunings<br/>(&quot;meantone&quot; in the most generic sense) where the value of T/S, or<br/>Blackwood&apos;s R, ranges from 2.25 (53-tet) to 4 (22-tet).</p><p>We can subdivide this Neo-Gothic region into a &quot;central&quot; neo-Gothic<br/>zone from 53-tet or Pythagorean through 17-tet, where R ranges from<br/>2.25 through 3; and a &quot;far&quot; neo-Gothic zone beyond 17-tet through<br/>22-tet, with R ranging from 3 through 4.</p><p>The following chart may illustrate this possible mapping; equal<br/>temperaments are identified by the number of steps per octave,<br/>Pythagorean tuning as &quot;Py,&quot; and exponential meantone as &quot;Ex&quot;:</p><p>   Py<br/>  53  41   29      Ex        17                39                 22<br/>   |--------|--------|--------|--------|--------|---------|--------|<br/>R 2.25     2.5      2.75      3       3.25     3.5       3.75      4<br/>   |--------------------------|------------------------------------|<br/>        Central neo-Gothic               Far neo-Gothic<br/>         (2.25 &lt;= R &lt;= 3)                  (3 &lt; R &lt;=4)</p><p>As is the case with many such mappings ranging from music history<br/>periodizations to stratigraphic boundaries in paleobiology, different<br/>schemes for &quot;drawing lines&quot; can bring out interesting concepts,<br/>whatever scheme we choose to adopt at a given moment or for a given<br/>purpose.</p><p>It might seem natural to adopt Pythagorean (or the almost identical<br/>53-tet) as the lower boundary of the neo-Gothic region, given our<br/>focus on &quot;reverse meantone temperaments&quot; with fifths wider than pure.<br/>Pythagorean tuning, or &quot;zero-comma meantone&quot; with pure fifths is the<br/>lower limit of this zone, just as it is the upper limit of meantone<br/>temperaments with fifths narrower than pure.[14]</p><p>If we focus on Blackwood&apos;s R, then 53-tet has the attraction of<br/>placing the lower boundary at the neat integer ratio of 9/4, or 2.25.<br/>Since 53-tet so closely resembles Pythagorean (when its steps are used<br/>to define intervals in a Pythagorean manner, of course), and has such<br/>a great potential for neo-Gothic music, both tunings seem to belong in<br/>the same category.[15]</p><p>Interestingly, Blackwood suggests a musical basis for setting a lower<br/>boundary slightly _below_ Pythagorean, but not much lower than 53-tet.<br/>In his view, 406 cents is about the maximize size at which major<br/>thirds can acceptably serve as stable concords; beyond this point,<br/>they become too acoustically complex and active to form stable 5-limit<br/>triads.[16]</p><p>Since the use of thirds as unstable although _relatively_ blending<br/>intervals is a cardinal feature both of historical Gothic polyphony<br/>and of its neo-Gothic offshoots, Blackwood&apos;s observation suggests a<br/>lower boundary at a fifth size of around 701.5 cents (~0.46 cents<br/>narrower than pure), producing a major third of 406 cents. Such a<br/>tuning would have a whole-tone of 203 cents and a diatonic semitone of<br/>92.5 cents, yielding an R of ~2.195.</p><p>Taking 53-tet as our lower limit provides a bit of artistic margin: in<br/>53-tet or Pythagorean, thirds have a distinctly active and dynamic<br/>quality fitting Gothic and neo-Gothic styles.</p><p>Setting the high end of the neo-Gothic spectrum at around 22-tet may<br/>reflect mainly the problem of the increasing temperament of the fifths<br/>(~7.14 cents in 22-tet) in styles where fifths and fourths are the<br/>primary concords. Disregarding this constraint, we might engage in<br/>interesting dialogues regarding the point at which major thirds<br/>growing into narrow fourths, or diatonic semitones shrinking into<br/>comma-like intervals difficult to recognize as &quot;half-steps,&quot; might<br/>clearly place us in a new musical terrain.[17]</p><p>If we do take the quality of fifths as a governing constraint, and<br/>draw an upper boundary at 22-tet, then these other factors may become<br/>more academic. In a neo-Gothic spectrum running from 53-tet and<br/>Pythagorean to 22-tet, diatonic semitones remain larger than 50 cents<br/>throughout the region, and major thirds range from a Pythagorean 81:64<br/>(or minutely smaller in 53-tet) to just larger than 9:7. Minor thirds<br/>range from around a Pythagorean 32:27 to slightly larger than 7:6, and<br/>major seconds from around a Pythagorean 9:8 to a kind of &quot;mean-tone&quot;<br/>in 22-tet about midway between a 9:8 and an 8:7.[18]</p><p>Following this approach, tunings and temperaments along a neo-Gothic<br/>spectrum of R=2.25-4 share a common family resemblance to medieval<br/>Pythagorean, giving the region a somewhat unified quality, and yet<br/>featuring an impressive range of variation.</p><p>One purpose for proposing such boundaries, of course, should be not to<br/>discourage but to provoke experimentation beyond recognized metes and<br/>bounds. If this discussion leads to more exploration of the world<br/>beyond R=4, it will have served its purpose.</p><p>-----------------------------------------<br/>3. Alternative thirds and 17-tet symmetry<br/>-----------------------------------------</p><p>If we provisionally accept R=2.25-4 as a range for distinctively<br/>neo-Gothic tunings -- as opposed to _meritorious_ tunings! -- there<br/>remains the question of why 17-tet (R=3) should serve as a line of<br/>demarcation between the central and far neo-Gothic zones.</p><p>One might reply that 17-tet is a well-known &quot;exaggerated Pythagorean&quot;<br/>temperament roughly in the middle of our spectrum[19], that it is the<br/>point where a diatonic semitone is equal to precisely 1/3-tone, or<br/>roughly the point beyond which the tempering of the fifth becomes a<br/>more substantial issue, or simply that R=3 is a nice round number.</p><p>There is, however, another basis for regarding 17-tet as a point of<br/>symmetry in relation to the neo-Gothic spectrum, a basis providing a<br/>connection between musical developments of the early 15th century and<br/>a possible &quot;reenvisioning of history&quot; through the use of new<br/>intonational variations on familiar 14th-century progressions.</p><p>In the decades around 1400, as Mark Lindley[20] has documented through<br/>theoretical sources and actual music, musicians became intrigued with<br/>a variation of Pythagorean intonation on keyboards where sharps were<br/>tuned at the flat end of the chain of fifths. In this tuning, thirds<br/>involving written sharps -- in such sonorities as D-F#-A, A-C#-E,<br/>E-G#-B -- had a distinctively smooth quality differing from the active<br/>flavor of regular Pythagorean thirds.</p><p>These alluring major and minor thirds were actually Pythagorean<br/>diminished fourths at 8192:6561 (~384.36 cents) and augmented seconds<br/>at 19683:16384 (~317.60 cents) -- e.g. D-Gb-A, A-Db-E, E-Ab-B --<br/>intervals removed only by a schisma of 32805:32768 from pure ratios of<br/>5:4 (~386.31 cents) and 6:5 (~315.64 cents). Thus they are often known<br/>today as &quot;schisma thirds.&quot;</p><p>By around 1450, the appetite of musicians for these &quot;alternative&quot;<br/>thirds evidently led to meantone temperaments seeking them in as many<br/>places as possible. This intonational shift may be seen as one aspect<br/>of the transition from Gothic to Renaissance musical style, often<br/>placed somewhere in the early to middle 15th century.</p><p>Reflecting on the 15th-century role of Pythagorean augmented seconds<br/>and diminished fourths as schisma thirds leads us to a new world of<br/>possibilities: the varied flavors these &quot;alternative thirds&quot; take on<br/>at different points along the neo-Gothic spectrum.</p><p>In Pythagorean tuning, as we have just seen, augmented seconds are<br/>very close to 6:5 and diminished fifths to 5:4; and this situation is<br/>almost identical in 53-tet.[21] More generally, the augmented second<br/>is smaller than the diminished fourth.</p><p>Let us see what happens to these alternative thirds as we move along<br/>the neo-Gothic spectrum. In the following table, the last column shows<br/>for equal temperaments the number of steps in these intervals, along<br/>with the arithmetic of their derivation: an augmented second from a<br/>whole-tone plus a chromatic semitone (equal to the difference between<br/>T and S); and a diminished fourth from a fourth minus a chromatic<br/>semitone.</p><p>----------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>tuning/         fifth        aug2      dim4     T/S=R     aug2/dim4<br/>temperament    (+/-3:2)                                     steps<br/>======================================================================<br/>53-tet          701.89     316.98     384.91     2.25      14    17<br/>                (-0.07)    (~6:5)     (~5:4)      9/4      9+5  22-5<br/>----------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>Pythagorean     701.96     317.60     384.86    ~2.26<br/>                 (0.00)    (~6:5)     (~5:4)<br/>----------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>41-tet          702.44     321.95     380.49     2.33...   11    13<br/>                (+0.48)                           7/3      7+4  17-4<br/>----------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>29-tet          703.45     331.03     372.41     2.50       8     9<br/>                (+1.49)   (~17:14)                5/2      5+3  12-3<br/>----------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>exponential     704.61     341.46     363.14    ~2.71828<br/>meantone        (+2.65)   (~17:14)   (~21:17)     (e)<br/>----------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>17-tet          705.88     352.94     352.94     3.00       5     5<br/>                (+3.93)    (~11:9)    (~11:9)     3/1      3+2   7-2<br/>======================================================================<br/>39-tet          707.69     369.23     338.46     3.50      12    11<br/>                (+5.73)   (~21:17)   (~17:14)     7/2      7+5  16-5<br/>----------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>22-tet          709.09     381.82     327.27     4.00       7     6<br/>                (+7.14)    (~5:4)                 4/1      4+3   9-3<br/>======================================================================</p><p>As we move outward from 53-tet or Pythagorean, our near-6:5 augmented<br/>seconds grow larger while our near-5:4 diminished fifths grow smaller.<br/>At 41-tet, this process is not too pronounced, so that we can still<br/>speak of &quot;schisma thirds&quot; in a quasi-Pythagorean sense at ~6.31 cents<br/>wider than 6:5 and ~5.83 cents narrower than 5:4.</p><p>By 29-tet or exponential meantone, however, we have moved into a<br/>different region where augmented seconds and diminished fourths take<br/>on a flavor of &quot;alternative thirds&quot; quite different from 5-limit<br/>intervals. There remains a certain polarity between these thirds,<br/>~341.46 cents and ~363.17 cents in exponential meantone: we might term<br/>them &quot;superminor/submajor,&quot; or in a more medieval Pythagorean fashion<br/>&quot;suprasemiditonal/subditonal.&quot; Such thirds may suggest various integer<br/>ratios such as 17:14 and 21:17, for example.</p><p>At 17-tet, our expanding augmented second and shrinking diminished<br/>fourth converge into a single &quot;neutral&quot; interval at ~352.94 cents,<br/>rather close to 11:9 and even closer to the 4-step interval of Gary<br/>Morrison&apos;s 88-cent equal temperament (88-cet). Thus 17-tet (R=3)<br/>represents a special &quot;moment of convergence&quot; on our spectrum.[22]</p><p>Beyond 17-tet, the augmented second represents the _larger_<br/>alternative third, and the diminished fourth the _smaller_ one. Thus<br/>at 39-tet, we have a situation somewhat comparable to exponential<br/>meantone, but with the roles of these two intervals reversed.</p><p>At 22-tet (R=4), our augmented second has expanded to an interval<br/>almost equivalent to the Pythagorean diminished fourth, a major third<br/>at ~381.82 cents (~4.49 cents narrower than 5:4); our diminished<br/>fourth has shrunk to a minor third of ~327.27 cents (~11.73 cents<br/>wider than 6:5), somewhat akin to a Pythagorean augmented second.</p><p>From a composer&apos;s perspective, the diverse alternative thirds of the<br/>neo-Gothic spectrum present a resource permitting us to &quot;reenvision<br/>history&quot; by experimenting with familiar Gothic progressions in new<br/>shades of intonation. The &quot;suprasemiditonal/subditonal&quot; thirds found<br/>in the portion of the central neo-Gothic zone around exponential<br/>meantone, and again in the far zone around 39-tet (with the roles of<br/>diminished fourth and augmented second reversed), offer special<br/>possibilities in this direction.</p><p>For example, it is quite possible to take standard 14th-century<br/>progressions where minor thirds contract to unisons and major thirds<br/>expand to fifths, and substitute these alternative thirds. Like<br/>Pythagorean thirds, they seem to have an active and passionate quality<br/>lending intensity to cadential action; yet their color is very<br/>different. Also, such progressions involve melodic motions by<br/>strikingly large _chromatic_ semitones, giving then a definite<br/>contrast in flavor to usual Gothic or neo-Gothic progressions with<br/>compact diatonic semitones.[23]</p><p>From the perspective of theory, these alternative thirds also provide<br/>a basis for distinguishing between a central neo-Gothic zone where<br/>augmented seconds are smaller than diminished fourths (R=2.25-3), and<br/>a far neo-Gothic zone where augmented seconds are the larger intervals<br/>(R=3-4). At 17-tet, R=3, these two thirds converge into one, a moment<br/>of symmetry (in a general as opposed to Wilsonian sense) serving as a<br/>kind of &quot;continental divide&quot; for the neo-Gothic spectrum.</p><p>----------------------------------------<br/>4. Through a looking glass enigmatically<br/>----------------------------------------</p><p>If we view the neo-Gothic meantone spectrum from Pythagorean or 53-tet<br/>to 22-tet (R=2.25-4) together with the historical European meantone<br/>spectrum from 19-tet to Pythagorean (R=1.5-~2.26), we may see both<br/>regions in better perspective. Here the main number line shows the<br/>tempering of the fifth in cents in the narrow (negative) or wide<br/>(positive) direction. As with the chart in Section 3, numbers<br/>immediately above this line identify equal temperaments, &quot;Py&quot; shows<br/>Pythagorean, and &quot;Ex&quot; exponential meantone; fractions represent<br/>various historical meantone tunings:</p><p>  1/3  2/7  1/4  1/5 1/6 1/8        Py         Ex<br/>   19        31             12     53 41  29       17      39     22<br/>    -|----|----|----|---|---|---|---|----|---|---|---|---|---|---|-<br/>5th -7   -6   -5   -4  -3  -2  -1   0    1   2   3   4   5   6   7<br/>R 1.5            1.75       2     2.25    2.5  2.75 3      3.5     4<br/>   |--------------------------------|------------------------------|<br/>          Historical meantone             Neo-Gothic meantone<br/>          (1.5 &lt;= R &lt;=~2.26)                (2.25 &lt;= R &lt;=4)<br/>   |------------------|             |---------------|--------------|<br/>      Characteristic                      Central          Far<br/>    (1.5 &lt;= R &lt;= ~1.82)              (2.25 &lt;= R &lt;=3)   (3 &lt; R &lt;= 4)</p><p>Proceeding from left to right, we travel first through the zone of<br/>&quot;characteristic&quot; meantone or meantone in the usual sense of<br/>temperaments from around 1/3-comma to 1/6-comma where fifths are<br/>narrowed in order to obtain pure or near-pure thirds, including 19-tet<br/>and 31-tet. Here R is appreciably less than 2, with diatonic semitones<br/>larger than chromatic semitones -- an especially colorful contrast in<br/>the area of 1/3-1/4 comma.</p><p>We next move through the intermediate region between 1/6-comma<br/>meantone and 53-tet or Pythagorean, including 12-tet (R=2). At about<br/>R=2.2, we reach Blackwood&apos;s limit of acceptability for 5-limit music,<br/>from another perspective our beckoning portal to the Gothic or<br/>neo-Gothic world of active and dynamic thirds and sixths efficiently<br/>resolving to stable 3-limit intervals.</p><p>At R=2.25 (53-tet) or R=~2.26 (Pythagorean) we are at the point of<br/>symmetry on our chart where fifths are virtually or precisely pure. As<br/>we continue through the central neo-Gothic zone, thirds and sixths<br/>become even more active while diatonic semitones shrink from around<br/>4/9-tone to 1/3-tone in 17-tet (R=3).</p><p>Much beyond Pythagorean, at least when seeking to maintain a 13th-14th<br/>century balance of concord/discord, we may &quot;Darregize/Sethareanize&quot;<br/>our timbres to keep our thirds _relatively_ blending while enjoying<br/>the &quot;superefficient&quot; resolutions they invite and the other special<br/>qualities of these tunings. With the right timbre for 17-tet, a<br/>half-cadence in Machaut on a major third can have the expected quality<br/>of a charming but pregnant pause rather than an acute clash!</p><p>Beyond 17-tet, we move through the far neo-Gothic zone where timbre<br/>adjustments can also mitigate the increasingly pronounced temperament<br/>of our fifths. We arrive at 22-tet (R=4), a xenharmonic outpost or<br/>resort where many features of the classic Pythagorean world are<br/>dramatically and intriguingly distorted, and yet the musical terrain<br/>remains recognizable.</p><p>Just as Ivor Darreg courageously asserted that _every_ equal<br/>temperament has its own potential for beautiful music[24], so each<br/>point and region on our meantone continuum has its own musical virtues<br/>and attractions. Some of these beautiful possibilities may more fully<br/>reveal themselves if we are familiar with the whole spectrum,<br/>including the region of Pythagorean and beyond, a region too often<br/>represented by the cartographic legend: &quot;And here there be Wolves.&quot;</p><p>For example, a quite familiar and conventional temperament such as<br/>12-tet can take on new qualities when we appreciate its intriguing<br/>ambivalence: is it a compromised 5-limit meantone, or a somewhat<br/>subdued &quot;semi-Gothic&quot; 3-limit tuning? One might creatively play on<br/>this ambiguity, with the 20th-century use of this scale for both<br/>tertian and quartal/quintal harmony (e.g. Bartok, Hindemith) a<br/>possible precedent. Once 12-tet is viewed as one member of a vast<br/>society of scales, not a substitute for all the others, this<br/>temperament and its surrounding &quot;middle country&quot; between Renaissance<br/>meantone and Pythagorean may flower in ways not yet imagined.</p><p>Returning to our main focus on the vibrant world of Gothic and<br/>neo-Gothic music and tunings, temperaments beyond Pythagorean could<br/>lead in many directions. One of the most intriguing is what I might<br/>term direct chromaticism.</p><p>While Gothic music of the 13th and 14th centuries has many routine and<br/>unconventional uses of accidentalism, chromaticism in the proper sense<br/>of melodic motion by a chromatic semitone is rather less common -- in<br/>contrast to the many examples of such chromaticism in the 16th-century<br/>ambience of tunings such as 1/4-comma meantone.</p><p>In these tunings the difference in size between the large diatonic and<br/>small chromatic semitones is dramatic, equal to a diesis of ~41.06<br/>cents in 1/4-comma meantone and ~63.16 cents (1/19 octave) in 19-tet,<br/>lending a special air to 16th-century chromatic progressions<br/>alternating between the two semitones.</p><p>While the contrast between the small _diatonic_ and large chromatic<br/>semitones is less dramatic in Pythagorean (~23.46 cents), as fifths<br/>get wider than pure the disparity rapidly increases to ~41.38 cents in<br/>29-tet (about the same as in 1/4-comma meantone) and ~55.28 cents in<br/>exponential meantone (not too far from 19-tet). A millennial era of<br/>neo-Gothic chromaticism may be at hand.[25]</p><p>Microtonalist and tuning theorist Graham Breed[26] has offered some<br/>interesting observations raising the question of what I might term<br/>&quot;direct commaticism&quot;: the use of the Pythagorean comma (e.g. Ab-G#),<br/>or its equivalents in various neo-Gothic temperaments as direct<br/>melodic intervals. This comma is equal to the difference between the<br/>diatonic and chromatic semitones discussed just above.</p><p>While I have used the direct melodic Pythagorean comma, e.g. Ab-G#, in<br/>&quot;neo-medieval&quot; interpretations of certain early 15th-century cadential<br/>progressions, such idioms may take on new flavors as we move through<br/>the neo-Gothic spectrum. By 29-tet or exponential meantone, as we have<br/>seen, this &quot;comma&quot; has grown to the size of a Renaissance meantone<br/>diesis, used as a direct melodic interval in the &quot;enharmonic&quot; style of<br/>Nicola Vicentino (1511-1576). Might one emulate Vicentino by using the<br/>diesis-like commas of these neo-Gothic tunings in amazing shifts and<br/>variations on standard medieval progressions?[27]</p><p>Then again, in 22-tet, the normal diatonic semitone of ~54.55 cents is<br/>around the size of a largish diesis, making the above categories<br/>rather problematic.[28] This temperament, like a good science fiction<br/>novel or physics book, is a feast for the intellect and imagination,<br/>as well as actually working musically -- and beautifully -- for Gothic<br/>or neo-Gothic music. Whether I compare the experience to travelling<br/>near the speed of light, or observing the behavior of photons near an<br/>extreme gravity well, 22-tet as a neo-medieval tuning deserves its own<br/>theory of relativity.</p><p>There is also the question of the world beyond 22-tet, possibly a<br/>region where neo-Gothic and gamelan may meet.</p><p>To consider such musical possibilities of the realm beginning with<br/>rather than ending at Pythagorean, a realm where the high art of the<br/>Gothic era may hold up &quot;a distant mirror&quot; not only to the present but<br/>to the future, is to gaze through a looking glass enigmatically, but<br/>the enigma is pleasant, enticing one to new music.</p><p>---------------<br/>Notes to Part 2<br/>---------------</p><p>14. This boundary would accord with the classification of equal<br/>temperaments as &quot;positive or negative (that is, fifths that fall short<br/>of 701.955-cent third harmonic or fifths that exceed the third<br/>harmonic).&quot; See Brian McLaren, &quot;A Brief History of Microtonality in<br/>the Twentieth Century,&quot; _Xenharmonikon_ 17:57-110 (Spring 1998), at<br/>p. 78, describing the work of M. Joel Mandelbaum.</p><p>15. Thus the Neo-Gothic spectrum begins with a tuning which has fifths<br/>very slightly narrower than pure; in technical terms, 53-tet might be<br/>described as ~1/315-comma meantone.</p><p>16.

Here Blackwood is suggesting a<br/>fifth size of 701.5 cents or major third size of 406 cents (R=~2.2) as<br/>an upper limit of acceptability for tertian music of the European<br/>Renaissance-Romantic repertory. Note that tunings somewhat below this<br/>limit, for example 12-tet (R=2), may be quite acceptable for Gothic or<br/>neo-Gothic as well as tertian music, but do not have the _distinctive_<br/>&quot;Gothic/neo-Gothic&quot; quality of tunings in the region of R=2.25-4 (from<br/>53-tet and Pythagorean to 22-tet).</p><p>17. At a fifth size of 710 cents (~8.04 cents wider than pure), we<br/>would have a major third of 440 cents and a minor second of 50 cents;<br/>at 712 cents (~10.04 cents wider than pure), 448 cents and 40 cents;<br/>at 714 cents (~12.04 cents wider than pure), 456 cents and 30 cents;<br/>at 715 cents (~13.04 cents wider than pure), 460 cents and 25 cents.<br/>At 710 cents, the value of R is 4.4; at 712 cents, 5.6; at 714 cents,<br/>7.6; at 715 cents, 9.2.</p><p>18. Thus two such 22-tet whole-tones form a near-9:7 major third, just<br/>as two whole-tones in 1/4-comma meantone (midway between 9:8 and 10:9)<br/>form a pure 5:4.</p><p>19. My warm thanks to John Chalmers for introducing me to this tuning;<br/>the &quot;exaggerated Pythagorean&quot; description may come from Ivor Darreg.</p><p>20. For Lindley&apos;s impressive thesis, see the articles cited in n. 12<br/>above.</p><p>21. From a Pythagorean point of view, people who treat 53-tet as a<br/>5-limit JI system are actually redefining major and minor schisma<br/>thirds (17 and 14 steps respectively) as regular thirds.</p><p>22. Here I am inspired by Ervin Wilson&apos;s &quot;Moment of Symmetry.&quot; Whether<br/>there is any connection between Pythagorean 17 being a moment of<br/>symmetry and 17-tet being a moment of convergence for augmented<br/>seconds and diminished fourths I leave as an intriguing question.</p><p>23. In neo-Gothic temperaments with fifths wider than pure, the<br/>greater-than-Pythagorean difference between these semitones can<br/>heighten such a contrast. In exponential meantone, for example, the<br/>diatonic semitone is ~76.97 cents and the chromatic semitone ~132.25<br/>cents, a situation somewhat resembling that of Renaissance meantones<br/>(where the diatonic semitone is the larger interval).</p><p>24. See McLaren, n. 14 above, pp. 80-81.</p><p>25. Interestingly, one medieval theorist who does demonstrate and<br/>advocate use of the direct chromatic semitone is Marchettus of Padua<br/>in his _Lucidarium_ (1318), a treatise also advocating that singers<br/>use cadential semitones or &quot;dieses&quot; equal to only &quot;one of the five<br/>parts of a tone.&quot; Whether or not Marchettus should be read as<br/>describing cadences with semitones considerably narrower than in<br/>Pythagorean and extra-wide major thirds and sixths -- and he is<br/>addressing vocal intonation rather than keyboard tunings -- his<br/>treatise has played a central role in my musical odyssey leading to<br/>this paper, which I therefore warmly dedicate to him.</p><p>26. Graham Breed, Tuning List, Tuning Digest 700 (6 July 2000),<br/>Message 25; and Tuning Digest 703 (7 July 2000), Message 8. Breed<br/>finds that the comma in 53-tet (1 step, ~22.64 cents) &quot;is too small to<br/>be clearly comprehended,&quot; and therefore has a &quot;troubling quality,&quot; but<br/>that the 41-tet comma (1 step, ~29.27 cents) is satisfactorily &quot;heard<br/>as a melodic elaboration.&quot; He finds a comma at a round 24 cents (in a<br/>synthesizer approximation of Pythagorean with fifths tuned to an even<br/>702 cents, ~0.04 cents wide) to be &quot;adequate,&quot; although &quot;it takes a<br/>bit of getting used to.&quot; In addition to directing my attention to the<br/>theme of &quot;commatic&quot; progressions, these observations invite further<br/>investigation of listener thresholds for the &quot;comprehension&quot; of very<br/>small melodic inflections.</p><p>27. This line of development may already be a reality, and in<br/>historically informed performances of the medieval repertory as well<br/>as in new compositions or improvisations in allied styles, since I<br/>have seen reports that at least one noted group (Mala Punica) is using<br/>&quot;micro-intervals&quot; for 14th-century Italian music.</p><p>28. Technically speaking, a diatonic semitone (or quartertone, R=4) in<br/>22-tet is equal to _half_ of the comma, the 2-step difference between<br/>the chromatic semitone of 3 steps and the diatonic semitone of 1 step.<br/>However, commalike distinctions in this temperament between regular<br/>and &quot;schisma&quot; thirds, for example (augmented second vs. major third,<br/>minor third vs. diminished fourth), involve a difference of 1 step,<br/>the same interval as the usual minor second.</p><p>Most respectfully,</p><p>Margo Schulter<br/><a href="mailto:mschulter@value.net">mschulter@value.net</a></p></div><h3><a id=11112 href="#11112">ðŸ”—</a>Paul Erlich &#x3C;PERLICH@ACADIAN-ASSET.COM&#x3E;</h3><span>7/8/2000 4:34:13 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@egroups.com">tuning@egroups.com</a>, &quot;M.

This boundary would accord with the classification of equal<br/>&gt; temperaments as &quot;positive or negative (that is, fifths that fall<br/>short<br/>&gt; of 701.955-cent third harmonic or fifths that exceed the third<br/>&gt; harmonic).&quot; See Brian McLaren, &quot;A Brief History of Microtonality in<br/>&gt; the Twentieth Century,&quot; _Xenharmonikon_ 17:57-110 (Spring 1998), at<br/>&gt; p. 78, describing the work of M.

The accepted definitions<br/>of<br/>positive and negative temperaments have their boundary at the 12-tET<br/>fifth of 700 cents. This is not because of any bias toward 12-tET;<br/>instead, it is motivated by the fact that positive temperaments form<br/>better approximations to 5-limit ratios through schismic (8 or 9<br/>fifths) intervals, while negative temperaments form better<br/>approximations of 5-limit ratios with ordinary diatonic thirds (3 or<br/>4<br/>fifths). The dividing line is 12-tET, in which the schismic and<br/>diatonic intervals are one and the same.</p></div>
