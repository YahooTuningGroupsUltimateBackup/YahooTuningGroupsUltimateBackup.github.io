The range I gave doesn&apos;t correspond to the &quot;width<br/>&gt; of the bucket&quot; -- would that be the distance between the two<br/>&gt; nearest local maxima?</p><p>Yes, I am referring to the width of the bucket up to the local<br/>maxima. Somewhere around 1230 the walls of the bucket rising up<br/>from 33/16 are lower than those from the 2/1, hence it stops<br/>being a bruised octave and starts being some distinct identity.</p><p>An interesting observation in this thread is that some microtonal<br/>useage really IS to have, for instance, a &apos;range&apos; of 5/4&apos;s. So<br/>a scale that contains a 9/7, 24/19 and 5/4 may just want a<br/>major third, spicy major third and very spicy major third. I<br/>have built my code to assume that a spicy major third may want<br/>to sink on some RI identity.</p><p>Note that with the current bucket shape, I am filling the<br/>HPHEC chart all the way up to the 1111 limit, however, the<br/>ratios that appear in the table turn out to be limited to<br/>around 33 limit (with this bucket tuning).</p><p>The complexity calculation I use gives some fudge factor<br/>to otonal ratios since I didn&apos;t like 5/3 beinlg less complex<br/>than 5/4 and is :</p><p>        comlexity = numerator * denominator;<br/>&#x9;if ( is_power_of_2( denominator ) )<br/>           complexity = complexity / 2;</p><p>I build the buckets linearly up in either direction from this<br/>point (and carry it to infinity, there is no saturation) and<br/>have played with the steepness. If I decrease the<br/>steepness the buckets become wider and the maximum included<br/>limit is decreased. Of course the opposite can be done as well.</p><p>Bob Valentine</p></div>
