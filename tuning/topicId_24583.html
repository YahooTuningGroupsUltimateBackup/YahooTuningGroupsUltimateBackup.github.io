Tones are<br/>one thing, and of course there is plenty of proof about how we perceive<br/>isolated tones. There is no proof about how we are programmed to hear music,<br/>even if it is comprised of tones and their overtones, etc. There are too<br/>many different kinds of music and people, and it&apos;s about exposure and<br/>acculturation (just like Lee Humphries said). Acoustics have some role, of<br/>course, but it&apos;s far too variable and evasive to ever pin down.</p><p>This, for me is a fundamental error with most just intonation arguments, and<br/>the other types of theories relating to pure tuning.<br/>&#x9;&#x9;<br/>------- End of forwarded message -------</p></div>
