You find them, as I said, in John Chalmers&apos;s book, and certainly in the Scala archive.<br/>I didn&apos;t mean to say it was an improvement, these were just examples of how you can mute from your scale structure<br/>(neutral diatonic) to another (7 quasi-edo), since you were interested in the the 7-edo aspect - and also examples of the perceptive importance of the number, in such scales, of the 12/11-neutral second type of interval, which act as semitones.<br/>It&apos;s a scale I just made up, but I have hundreds of those because I worked a lot many years ago, on scales classification, and specially on the different classes of neutral diatonics, that are a huge part of the traditional folk tunings from the wole world.<br/>If you look in the Scala archive at &quot;dudon-thai&quot;, you will find some 7 quasi-edo model of a different scale structure, made up of 6 &quot;11/10&quot; type of interval for only one &quot;10/9&quot;. Do you hear any difference between those and this two &quot;10/9&quot;<br/>(108 : 120 : 132 : 145 : 160 : 178 : 196) ?<br/>- - - - - - -<br/>Jacques</p><p>&gt; Jacques,<br/>&gt; Interesting, I&apos;ve messed with scales and ended up simply running &gt; into Ptolemy&apos;s scales before. Where&apos;s a good place to find a &gt; collection of these?...the few I&apos;ve seen are simply delightful and &gt; very accessible scales.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;&quot;3. not a single 12/11 : by changing here 72 to 145 :<br/>&gt; 108 : 120 : 132 : 145 : 160 : 178 : 196&quot;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Now this is definitely an improvement to take into consideration!<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; The closest ratio here is more like 11/10 and less like 10/9 and &gt; more quasi-7EDO than my scale which &quot;only&quot; gets to 12/11 and not &gt; the larger/more desirable 11/10 as the smallest interval in the scale.<br/>&gt; Also that scale fits pretty closely with the x/27th partials of the &gt; harmonic series for the most part and every fraction has a common &gt; denominator of 3 (IE 108 = 3 * 36 and 54 = 3 * 18).<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Another question: did the scale you mention already exist or did &gt; you just manage to come up with it? :-)<br/>&gt; I&apos;m definitely going to have to try composing with that one....<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Thank you very much for your post...this is immensely helpful. :-)</p></div>
