It looks like you did some<br/>&gt; divisions by the Golden Ratio and then reflected them within the octave.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; On a lark I did something similar, but without the reflection. Here&apos;s<br/>&gt; the process:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; 1200 cents divided by the Golden Ratio gives you 742 &amp; 458 cents.<br/>&gt; 742 divided gives you 458 &amp; 283.<br/>&gt; 458 divided gives you 283 &amp; 175.<br/>&gt; 283 divided gives you 175 &amp; 108.<br/>&gt; 175 divided gives you 108 &amp; 67.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; (I did the math with higher precision, of course.)<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; That&apos;s as far as I divided things. When you stack them up &quot;properly&quot;,<br/>&gt; with each division in its place and the smaller number on top for each<br/>&gt; division, I get this scale:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;   108.20393<br/>&gt;   175.07764<br/>&gt;   283.28157<br/>&gt;   391.48551<br/>&gt;   458.35921<br/>&gt;   566.56315<br/>&gt;   633.43685<br/>&gt;   741.64079<br/>&gt;   849.84472<br/>&gt;   916.71843<br/>&gt; 1024.92236<br/>&gt; 1133.12629<br/>&gt; 1200.00000<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; It&apos;s a 13-note strictly proper scale made of two step sizes, arranged as<br/>&gt; LSLLSLSLLSLLS. &quot;Show Data&quot; in Scala shows things I haven&apos;t seen before<br/>&gt; in other scales I&apos;ve contstructed (or slapped together, as things may<br/>&gt; be): &quot;distributional even&quot; (does that mean MOS?), constant structure,<br/>&gt; rothenberg stability = 1, Myhill&apos;s property, etc. But I don&apos;t know what<br/>&gt; these things mean, so I&apos;m not sure if they matter.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; If you&apos;re trying to approximate JI, it looks like you&apos;re out of luck<br/>&gt; (though the high-prime-limit people around here may tell me otherwise),<br/>&gt; but the scale sounds surprisingly stable and kind of interesting anyway.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Regards,<br/>&gt; Jake<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; I always knew this day would come. ;-)<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; <a href="http://cortaigne.mitb.net/phifths/">http://cortaigne.mitb.net/phifths/</a><br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; <a href="http://cortaigne.mitb.net/phifth1.mp3">http://cortaigne.mitb.net/phifth1.mp3</a><br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; <a href="http://cortaigne.mitb.net/phifth2.mp3">http://cortaigne.mitb.net/phifth2.mp3</a><br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt;</p></div><h3>genewardsmith &#x3C;genewardsmith@...&#x3E;</h3><span>4/10/2011 10:04:50 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, Jake Freivald &lt;jdfreivald@...&gt; wrote:</p><p>&gt; It&apos;s a 13-note strictly proper scale made of two step sizes, arranged as<br/>&gt; LSLLSLSLLSLLS. &quot;Show Data&quot; in Scala shows things I haven&apos;t seen before<br/>&gt; in other scales I&apos;ve contstructed (or slapped together, as things may<br/>&gt; be): &quot;distributional even&quot; (does that mean MOS?), constant structure,<br/>&gt; rothenberg stability = 1, Myhill&apos;s property, etc. But I don&apos;t know what<br/>&gt; these things mean, so I&apos;m not sure if they matter.</p><p>The reason for all this is that you&apos;ve constructed a MOS with a Fibonacci number of notes using a generator of 1/phi octaves.

First, this isn&apos;t the 34th root of phi, which would mean that we&apos;re dividing phi into 34 equal parts. (By &quot;equal&quot; I mean equal in cents.) Second, the Fibonacci connection seems to be a happy accident, perhaps resulting from the special relationship phi has with the Fibonacci series; I didn&apos;t plan on using Fibonacci numbers at all when I started this.</p><p>Also, note that &quot;phi&quot; means something different compared to the 12th root of phi scale.</p><p>In that scale, I used phi directly, as a ratio: Just as 3/2 = 1.5 = 702 cents, phi = 1.61803399..., or 833 cents.</p><p>In this scale, I found the Golden Section of the 1200-cent octave. It might be easier to think of in spatial terms, so think of finding Golden sections in the width of a 1200mm-wide canvas. That means (a+b)/a = a/b, so (1200 mm)/a mm = a mm / b mm. Solving for a and b gives you about 742 mm and about 458 mm.  Then I divided each section of the painting into its golden section: 742 mm has a Golden Section at 458 mm and 283 mm, 458 has a Golden section at 283 mm and 175 mm, and so on, until the entire canvas is divided up into strips that are either 67mm or 108 mm wide.</p><p>Igs,</p><p>&gt; This looks like some variety of Father temperament.</p><p>As you can see from the procedure above, the first scale I gave wasn&apos;t a temperament of anything. It was &quot;just intonation&quot;, except the factor used was an irrational number instead of a product of primes.</p><p>When I started talking about approximating it by using some EDO or another that I started tempering it.</p><p>&gt; What are the audible sonic properties that one could expect from such a scale?<br/>&gt; Will such a relationship to phi lead to anything musically important?</p><p>Good questions.</p><p>Since the procedure leads to a very regular scale, it may be usable because it has the properties of propriety, only two step sizes, and so on. This may be true regardless of the fact that it&apos;s related to phi.</p><p>If the ear likes phi the way the eye does, it&apos;s possible that these intervals will sound pleasing enough even though they don&apos;t approximate many JI intervals. Triads or melodies based on the relationship (a+b)/a = a/b might sound good: 0-741-1200, 0-283-458, 0-108-175, etc. Tetrads might include breaking these elements down into other phi-based ratios, like 0-548-741-1200. These might be a sort of alternate harmony that &quot;works&quot; despite not being related to prime intervals.</p><p>Then again, there&apos;s no physical reason for me to think the ear will like these relationships. If the ear doesn&apos;t like phi, these may sound like junk. :)</p><p>Playing around with it in a preliminary way suggests that some of this sounds okay, but whether that&apos;s related to phi or not isn&apos;t clear to me.</p><p>Regards,<br/>Jake</p></div><h3>Chris Vaisvil &#x3C;chrisvaisvil@...&#x3E;</h3><span>4/12/2011 4:21:54 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Hi Jake,</p><p>If possible could you post a scala file of the 13 note / Phi and 34 note /<br/>Phi tuning you mentioned?</p><p>Thanks,<br/>Chris</p><p>The approximations for the scale in 13 are up to 25 cents off.
