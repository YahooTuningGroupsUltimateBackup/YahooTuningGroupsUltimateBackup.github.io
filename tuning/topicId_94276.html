Whether I have either adequate technical means or<br/>the right skills to become an official moderator -- presumably<br/>one of at least three, as I understand -- remains an open<br/>question.</p><p>However, there&apos;s another office here that I share with Carl,<br/>Ozan, and all of you: facilitating the group and its smooth if<br/>often spirited operation. We are all facilitators -- for better,<br/>or for otherwise.</p><p>As you have discussed, Carl, the office of moderator is a bit<br/>like that of a proverbial regal log: mostly deleting spam and so<br/>forth. However, a moderator -- and this is now my interpretation<br/>-- will tend to be viewed as Facilitator-in-Chief, setting the<br/>tone as to how others should facilitate. And since we are all<br/>facilitators, I would like to propose a few possible standards<br/>and guidelines.</p><p>These are guidelines which I would try to follow and promote as a<br/>moderator, and I will try to follow and promote as one<br/>facilitator among many (a description fitting moderators as well<br/>as everyone else here).</p><p>The keynote here, I think, is to promote melodic and harmonic<br/>empathy: a climate where all alternative styles, theories, and<br/>compositional or improvisational and other performance methods<br/>are warmly welcome. Since &quot;microtonality&quot; isn&apos;t a genre, but a<br/>dimension and technique of music, pluralism and diversity go with<br/>our territory, and we need to handle it amicably and gracefully.</p><p>In that spirit, here are some of my ideas on guidelines:</p><p>     (1) ALL LEVELS WELCOME. The first hallmark of a truly<br/>         academic outlook in the most positive sense is not<br/>         merely the possession of knowledge and skills, and their<br/>         increase by research and practice, but a willingness to<br/>         share and transmit that knowledge and those skills: in<br/>         other words, to teach. Receptiveness to beginners, and<br/>         to &quot;casual&quot; or &quot;curious&quot; participants or visitors, is a<br/>         mark of academic devotion as well as common decency.</p><p>     (2) MAINTAIN AT LEAST THE ILLUSION OF UNIVERSAL GOODWILL.<br/>         Sometimes it may seem like a very bare and formal<br/>         illusion, a mere suspension of disbelief, but acting as<br/>         if universal goodwill prevailed here is one step toward<br/>         bringing it about, or at least not moving us further<br/>         from it! This may seem like maintaining a facade; but if<br/>         we don&apos;t maintain it, our structure of solidarity which<br/>         makes this group possible as a community will collapse,<br/>         or at least become very unpleasant to inhabit.</p><p>     (3) SOMETIMES SILENCE IS PRECIOUS. If we really can&apos;t find a<br/>         kind word to say about the topic of a thread, or a<br/>         proposed theory, or a piece of music submitted here,<br/>         then silence is the best policy! This isn&apos;t at all to<br/>         exclude constructive criticism and even spirited debate<br/>         of a mutually agreeable nature, but it is to exclude<br/>         destructive criticism of other list members. Of course,<br/>         a &quot;kind word&quot; can be combined with constructive<br/>         criticisms or suggestions, but we need to be confident<br/>         that they will be received as such. Otherwise, silence<br/>         has the big advantage of saving bandwidth for<br/>         constructive interactions that promote our community&apos;s<br/>         well-being.</p><p>     (4) IF THIS BE TROLLING. A quirk of Anglo-American history<br/>         is the concept of &quot;treason&quot; as a crime which in English<br/>         law, despite the attempt in 1352 during the reign of<br/>         King Edward III to limit its scope, could mean almost<br/>         anything, with the United States Constitution thus<br/>         declaring a narrow definition. In Usenet and now<br/>         Yahoogroups history, &quot;trolling&quot; has a similar<br/>         history. Therefore I would propose a narrow definition:</p><p>              Trolling in our Tuning group, when used in its<br/>              usual negative sense, shall consist only in the<br/>              following:</p><p>              (a) Posting personally abusive messages directed at<br/>                  other members with the intention of promoting<br/>                  conflict or &quot;flame wars&quot;;</p><p>              (b) Posting messages purported to be from or<br/>                  represent the views of other members with the<br/>                  purpose of starting what might be called a<br/>                  &quot;catalytic flame war&quot; (that is, for party A to<br/>                  post in order to convince parties B and C that<br/>                  they mutually loathe each other and should act<br/>                  so as to engage in destructive conflict, often<br/>                  with maximum harm to the group as a whole);</p><p>              (c) Posting messages in order to win the trust of<br/>                  one or more members, and then betraying that<br/>                  trust by doing something on the group<br/>                  calculated to hurt them, and often to disrupt<br/>                  the group as a whole or shatter the mutual<br/>                  trust that makes it possible. While this kind<br/>                  of trolling is especially characteristic of<br/>                  groups dealing with sensitive or private<br/>                  personal issues, music is a very personal<br/>                  thing, so I mention it; and</p><p>              (d) Referring to another member as a &quot;troll&quot; --<br/>                  unless the harmless and humorous sense of the<br/>                  term is clear (see below) -- without good<br/>                  reason to support a claim that the person is<br/>                  intentionally doing (a), (b), or (c) above.</p><p>         Another way of summing up the point here is to say that<br/>         mere posting on topics or theories or scales you find<br/>         uninteresting, even tediously so, or demonstrations of<br/>         what you may consider almost-but-not-quite-sublime<br/>         cluelessness, are not &quot;trolling&quot; in the above sense.</p><p>         They may, however, approach unintentional exercises in<br/>         the ancient Usenet art of what I&apos;ll call &quot;play-<br/>         trolling.&quot; Basically this means now and then engaging in<br/>         random acts of harmless cluelessness such as asking<br/>         comically absurd questions or offering strange remarks in<br/>         order to keep us all in practice when it comes to<br/>         responding with civility to equally curious questions or<br/>         remarks some hypothetical newcomer just might offer in<br/>         earnest. For example:</p><p>                * &quot;What is the Tuning group, and how much does it<br/>                  cost to join?&quot;</p><p>                * &quot;My theory of harmonic entropy tells me that<br/>                  every note Bartok ever wrote was dissonant, and<br/>                  will remain so in mappings to any circulating<br/>                  12-note system -- except for the major sevenths<br/>                  and minor seconds in &grave;Major Sevenths, Minor<br/>                  Seconds&apos;.&quot; (Thanks to a famous post on<br/>                  rec.music.theory here adapted to this list.)</p><p>         I&apos;m not suggesting that this kind of &quot;play-trolling&quot; or<br/>         xenodiscourse should become the norm for the group: a<br/>         little may go a long way. But compared to destructive<br/>         trolling as defined above, and including unwarranted<br/>         accusations of such trolling, a bit of harmless<br/>         absurdity or surrealism might be a lot healthier for<br/>         this group than exchanges of insults and accusations.</p><p>     (5) SHOULD THIS EXPLETIVE BE DELETED? One cardinal rule<br/>         would be to avoid expletives, or even &quot;innocent&quot; words<br/>         that may look and sound like expletives, in situations<br/>         where the tone might be perceived as less than jovial<br/>         (which includes lots of situations on groups in<br/>         cyberspace without visual or aural cues and immediate<br/>         feedback to clarify intentions).</p><p>         Thus there&apos;s a perfectly innocent term for a cetacean<br/>         respiratory passage or &quot;nostril&quot; that recently came up<br/>         here, and as applied figuratively to a human, properly<br/>         indicates one&apos;s mouth, especially when used for a large<br/>         quantity of speech. Personally I&apos;d try to take it as a<br/>         compliment, since having one of my longer posts compared<br/>         to a whale song in a nasal register might be an overly<br/>         generous review. But people&apos;s anatomical imaginations<br/>         can take other directions, especially when the context<br/>         of the term doesn&apos;t seem so friendly or complimentary.</p><p>         If I had my druthers, language here would remain<br/>         decorous, but I must confess to enjoying all of Chaucer<br/>         and Boccaccio as well as Marguerite of Navarre, and to<br/>         &quot;eschewing censorship.&quot; An expletive now and then in<br/>         sheer exuberance or enthusiasm is harmless, but when<br/>         they&apos;re fired off in anger with another member as the<br/>         target, we&apos;re in the problem zone, and need to move out<br/>         of it decisively, starting now since yesterday is beyond<br/>         our power.</p><p>Please let me conclude by warmly thanking Carl for his services<br/>and participation over many years; Ozan, for his scholarship and<br/>wonderful posts on maqam music and much else, not to mention our<br/>many offline dialogues in which he has proven a gifted teacher<br/>and mentor; and all of us, for making this group possible, whose<br/>future we hold in our hands as its cooperative co-facilitators.</p><p>Most respectively,</p><p>Margo Schulter<br/>mschulter@...</p></div><h3><a id=94280 href="#94280">ðŸ”—</a>Brofessor &#x3C;kraiggrady@...&#x3E;</h3><span>11/5/2010 2:29:52 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Yes a big thank you to Carl for a job that required much.<br/>I hope that he will continue sharing with his investigations</p><p>I would also like to say that i would fully support Margo being a Moderator without any reservation.<br/>She strikes me as truly one of the most qualified person to be so.</p><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, Margo Schulter &lt;mschulter@...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Hello, Ozan and Carl and all.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; First, Carl, please let me congratulate you on your years of<br/>&gt; service as moderator of our group, and wish you the best in your<br/>&gt; future endeavors on or off this list at the point where you do<br/>&gt; step down.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Secondly, Carl and Ozan, thank you both warmly for our many<br/>&gt; spirited dialogues and exchanges of ideas, which I hope will<br/>&gt; continue, whatever our roles on this list.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; In recent days, as it has been revealed that Carl may not be too<br/>&gt; far from passing his moderatorial torch to others, there have<br/>&gt; been discussions about how this group should ideally be<br/>&gt; moderated, as well as proposals that I might take part in<br/>&gt; moderating it.

Personally I&apos;d try to take it as a<br/>&gt;           compliment, since having one of my longer posts compared<br/>&gt;           to a whale song in a nasal register might be an overly<br/>&gt;           generous review. But people&apos;s anatomical imaginations<br/>&gt;           can take other directions, especially when the context<br/>&gt;           of the term doesn&apos;t seem so friendly or complimentary.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;           If I had my druthers, language here would remain<br/>&gt;           decorous, but I must confess to enjoying all of Chaucer<br/>&gt;           and Boccaccio as well as Marguerite of Navarre, and to<br/>&gt;           &quot;eschewing censorship.&quot; An expletive now and then in<br/>&gt;           sheer exuberance or enthusiasm is harmless, but when<br/>&gt;           they&apos;re fired off in anger with another member as the<br/>&gt;           target, we&apos;re in the problem zone, and need to move out<br/>&gt;           of it decisively, starting now since yesterday is beyond<br/>&gt;           our power.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Please let me conclude by warmly thanking Carl for his services<br/>&gt; and participation over many years; Ozan, for his scholarship and<br/>&gt; wonderful posts on maqam music and much else, not to mention our<br/>&gt; many offline dialogues in which he has proven a gifted teacher<br/>&gt; and mentor; and all of us, for making this group possible, whose<br/>&gt; future we hold in our hands as its cooperative co-facilitators.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Most respectively,<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Margo Schulter<br/>&gt; mschulter@...<br/>&gt;</p></div><h3><a id=94281 href="#94281">ðŸ”—</a>cityoftheasleep &#x3C;igliashon@...&#x3E;</h3><span>11/5/2010 2:59:03 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Bravo, Margo.  Well said!</p><p>-Igs</p><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, Margo Schulter &lt;mschulter@...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Hello, Ozan and Carl and all.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; First, Carl, please let me congratulate you on your years of<br/>&gt; service as moderator of our group, and wish you the best in your<br/>&gt; future endeavors on or off this list at the point where you do<br/>&gt; step down.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Secondly, Carl and Ozan, thank you both warmly for our many<br/>&gt; spirited dialogues and exchanges of ideas, which I hope will<br/>&gt; continue, whatever our roles on this list.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; In recent days, as it has been revealed that Carl may not be too<br/>&gt; far from passing his moderatorial torch to others, there have<br/>&gt; been discussions about how this group should ideally be<br/>&gt; moderated, as well as proposals that I might take part in<br/>&gt; moderating it. Whether I have either adequate technical means or<br/>&gt; the right skills to become an official moderator -- presumably<br/>&gt; one of at least three, as I understand -- remains an open<br/>&gt; question.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; However, there&apos;s another office here that I share with Carl,<br/>&gt; Ozan, and all of you: facilitating the group and its smooth if<br/>&gt; often spirited operation. We are all facilitators -- for better,<br/>&gt; or for otherwise.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; As you have discussed, Carl, the office of moderator is a bit<br/>&gt; like that of a proverbial regal log: mostly deleting spam and so<br/>&gt; forth. However, a moderator -- and this is now my interpretation<br/>&gt; -- will tend to be viewed as Facilitator-in-Chief, setting the<br/>&gt; tone as to how others should facilitate. And since we are all<br/>&gt; facilitators, I would like to propose a few possible standards<br/>&gt; and guidelines.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; These are guidelines which I would try to follow and promote as a<br/>&gt; moderator, and I will try to follow and promote as one<br/>&gt; facilitator among many (a description fitting moderators as well<br/>&gt; as everyone else here).<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; The keynote here, I think, is to promote melodic and harmonic<br/>&gt; empathy: a climate where all alternative styles, theories, and<br/>&gt; compositional or improvisational and other performance methods<br/>&gt; are warmly welcome. Since &quot;microtonality&quot; isn&apos;t a genre, but a<br/>&gt; dimension and technique of music, pluralism and diversity go with<br/>&gt; our territory, and we need to handle it amicably and gracefully.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; In that spirit, here are some of my ideas on guidelines:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;       (1) ALL LEVELS WELCOME. The first hallmark of a truly<br/>&gt;           academic outlook in the most positive sense is not<br/>&gt;           merely the possession of knowledge and skills, and their<br/>&gt;           increase by research and practice, but a willingness to<br/>&gt;           share and transmit that knowledge and those skills: in<br/>&gt;           other words, to teach. Receptiveness to beginners, and<br/>&gt;           to &quot;casual&quot; or &quot;curious&quot; participants or visitors, is a<br/>&gt;           mark of academic devotion as well as common decency.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;       (2) MAINTAIN AT LEAST THE ILLUSION OF UNIVERSAL GOODWILL.<br/>&gt;           Sometimes it may seem like a very bare and formal<br/>&gt;           illusion, a mere suspension of disbelief, but acting as<br/>&gt;           if universal goodwill prevailed here is one step toward<br/>&gt;           bringing it about, or at least not moving us further<br/>&gt;           from it! This may seem like maintaining a facade; but if<br/>&gt;           we don&apos;t maintain it, our structure of solidarity which<br/>&gt;           makes this group possible as a community will collapse,<br/>&gt;           or at least become very unpleasant to inhabit.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;       (3) SOMETIMES SILENCE IS PRECIOUS. If we really can&apos;t find a<br/>&gt;           kind word to say about the topic of a thread, or a<br/>&gt;           proposed theory, or a piece of music submitted here,<br/>&gt;           then silence is the best policy! This isn&apos;t at all to<br/>&gt;           exclude constructive criticism and even spirited debate<br/>&gt;           of a mutually agreeable nature, but it is to exclude<br/>&gt;           destructive criticism of other list members. Of course,<br/>&gt;           a &quot;kind word&quot; can be combined with constructive<br/>&gt;           criticisms or suggestions, but we need to be confident<br/>&gt;           that they will be received as such. Otherwise, silence<br/>&gt;           has the big advantage of saving bandwidth for<br/>&gt;           constructive interactions that promote our community&apos;s<br/>&gt;           well-being.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;       (4) IF THIS BE TROLLING. A quirk of Anglo-American history<br/>&gt;           is the concept of &quot;treason&quot; as a crime which in English<br/>&gt;           law, despite the attempt in 1352 during the reign of<br/>&gt;           King Edward III to limit its scope, could mean almost<br/>&gt;           anything, with the United States Constitution thus<br/>&gt;           declaring a narrow definition. In Usenet and now<br/>&gt;           Yahoogroups history, &quot;trolling&quot; has a similar<br/>&gt;           history. Therefore I would propose a narrow definition:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;                Trolling in our Tuning group, when used in its<br/>&gt;                usual negative sense, shall consist only in the<br/>&gt;                following:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;                (a) Posting personally abusive messages directed at<br/>&gt;                    other members with the intention of promoting<br/>&gt;                    conflict or &quot;flame wars&quot;;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;                (b) Posting messages purported to be from or<br/>&gt;                    represent the views of other members with the<br/>&gt;                    purpose of starting what might be called a<br/>&gt;                    &quot;catalytic flame war&quot; (that is, for party A to<br/>&gt;                    post in order to convince parties B and C that<br/>&gt;                    they mutually loathe each other and should act<br/>&gt;                    so as to engage in destructive conflict, often<br/>&gt;                    with maximum harm to the group as a whole);<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;                (c) Posting messages in order to win the trust of<br/>&gt;                    one or more members, and then betraying that<br/>&gt;                    trust by doing something on the group<br/>&gt;                    calculated to hurt them, and often to disrupt<br/>&gt;                    the group as a whole or shatter the mutual<br/>&gt;                    trust that makes it possible. While this kind<br/>&gt;                    of trolling is especially characteristic of<br/>&gt;                    groups dealing with sensitive or private<br/>&gt;                    personal issues, music is a very personal<br/>&gt;                    thing, so I mention it; and<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;                (d) Referring to another member as a &quot;troll&quot; --<br/>&gt;                    unless the harmless and humorous sense of the<br/>&gt;                    term is clear (see below) -- without good<br/>&gt;                    reason to support a claim that the person is<br/>&gt;                    intentionally doing (a), (b), or (c) above.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;           Another way of summing up the point here is to say that<br/>&gt;           mere posting on topics or theories or scales you find<br/>&gt;           uninteresting, even tediously so, or demonstrations of<br/>&gt;           what you may consider almost-but-not-quite-sublime<br/>&gt;           cluelessness, are not &quot;trolling&quot; in the above sense.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;           They may, however, approach unintentional exercises in<br/>&gt;           the ancient Usenet art of what I&apos;ll call &quot;play-<br/>&gt;           trolling.&quot; Basically this means now and then engaging in<br/>&gt;           random acts of harmless cluelessness such as asking<br/>&gt;           comically absurd questions or offering strange remarks in<br/>&gt;           order to keep us all in practice when it comes to<br/>&gt;           responding with civility to equally curious questions or<br/>&gt;           remarks some hypothetical newcomer just might offer in<br/>&gt;           earnest. For example:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;                  * &quot;What is the Tuning group, and how much does it<br/>&gt;                    cost to join?&quot;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;                  * &quot;My theory of harmonic entropy tells me that<br/>&gt;                    every note Bartok ever wrote was dissonant, and<br/>&gt;                    will remain so in mappings to any circulating<br/>&gt;                    12-note system -- except for the major sevenths<br/>&gt;                    and minor seconds in &grave;Major Sevenths, Minor<br/>&gt;                    Seconds&apos;.&quot; (Thanks to a famous post on<br/>&gt;                    rec.music.theory here adapted to this list.)<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;           I&apos;m not suggesting that this kind of &quot;play-trolling&quot; or<br/>&gt;           xenodiscourse should become the norm for the group: a<br/>&gt;           little may go a long way. But compared to destructive<br/>&gt;           trolling as defined above, and including unwarranted<br/>&gt;           accusations of such trolling, a bit of harmless<br/>&gt;           absurdity or surrealism might be a lot healthier for<br/>&gt;           this group than exchanges of insults and accusations.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;       (5) SHOULD THIS EXPLETIVE BE DELETED? One cardinal rule<br/>&gt;           would be to avoid expletives, or even &quot;innocent&quot; words<br/>&gt;           that may look and sound like expletives, in situations<br/>&gt;           where the tone might be perceived as less than jovial<br/>&gt;           (which includes lots of situations on groups in<br/>&gt;           cyberspace without visual or aural cues and immediate<br/>&gt;           feedback to clarify intentions).<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;           Thus there&apos;s a perfectly innocent term for a cetacean<br/>&gt;           respiratory passage or &quot;nostril&quot; that recently came up<br/>&gt;           here, and as applied figuratively to a human, properly<br/>&gt;           indicates one&apos;s mouth, especially when used for a large<br/>&gt;           quantity of speech. Personally I&apos;d try to take it as a<br/>&gt;           compliment, since having one of my longer posts compared<br/>&gt;           to a whale song in a nasal register might be an overly<br/>&gt;           generous review.

Therefore I would propose a narrow definition:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;                 Trolling in our Tuning group, when used in its<br/>&gt;                 usual negative sense, shall consist only in the<br/>&gt;                 following:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;                 (a) Posting personally abusive messages directed at<br/>&gt;                     other members with the intention of promoting<br/>&gt;                     conflict or &quot;flame wars&quot;;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;                 (b) Posting messages purported to be from or<br/>&gt;                     represent the views of other members with the<br/>&gt;                     purpose of starting what might be called a<br/>&gt;                     &quot;catalytic flame war&quot; (that is, for party A to<br/>&gt;                     post in order to convince parties B and C that<br/>&gt;                     they mutually loathe each other and should act<br/>&gt;                     so as to engage in destructive conflict, often<br/>&gt;                     with maximum harm to the group as a whole);<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;                 (c) Posting messages in order to win the trust of<br/>&gt;                     one or more members, and then betraying that<br/>&gt;                     trust by doing something on the group<br/>&gt;                     calculated to hurt them, and often to disrupt<br/>&gt;                     the group as a whole or shatter the mutual<br/>&gt;                     trust that makes it possible. While this kind<br/>&gt;                     of trolling is especially characteristic of<br/>&gt;                     groups dealing with sensitive or private<br/>&gt;                     personal issues, music is a very personal<br/>&gt;                     thing, so I mention it; and<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;                 (d) Referring to another member as a &quot;troll&quot; --<br/>&gt;                     unless the harmless and humorous sense of the<br/>&gt;                     term is clear (see below) -- without good<br/>&gt;                     reason to support a claim that the person is<br/>&gt;                     intentionally doing (a), (b), or (c) above.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;            Another way of summing up the point here is to say that<br/>&gt;            mere posting on topics or theories or scales you find<br/>&gt;            uninteresting, even tediously so, or demonstrations of<br/>&gt;            what you may consider almost-but-not-quite-sublime<br/>&gt;            cluelessness, are not &quot;trolling&quot; in the above sense.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;            They may, however, approach unintentional exercises in<br/>&gt;            the ancient Usenet art of what I&apos;ll call &quot;play-<br/>&gt;            trolling.&quot; Basically this means now and then engaging in<br/>&gt;            random acts of harmless cluelessness such as asking<br/>&gt;            comically absurd questions or offering strange remarks in<br/>&gt;            order to keep us all in practice when it comes to<br/>&gt;            responding with civility to equally curious questions or<br/>&gt;            remarks some hypothetical newcomer just might offer in<br/>&gt;            earnest. For example:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;                   * &quot;What is the Tuning group, and how much does it<br/>&gt;                     cost to join?&quot;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;                   * &quot;My theory of harmonic entropy tells me that<br/>&gt;                     every note Bartok ever wrote was dissonant, and<br/>&gt;                     will remain so in mappings to any circulating<br/>&gt;                     12-note system -- except for the major sevenths<br/>&gt;                     and minor seconds in &grave;Major Sevenths, Minor<br/>&gt;                     Seconds&apos;.&quot; (Thanks to a famous post on<br/>&gt;                     rec.music.theory here adapted to this list.)<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;            I&apos;m not suggesting that this kind of &quot;play-trolling&quot; or<br/>&gt;            xenodiscourse should become the norm for the group: a<br/>&gt;            little may go a long way. But compared to destructive<br/>&gt;            trolling as defined above, and including unwarranted<br/>&gt;            accusations of such trolling, a bit of harmless<br/>&gt;            absurdity or surrealism might be a lot healthier for<br/>&gt;            this group than exchanges of insults and accusations.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;        (5) SHOULD THIS EXPLETIVE BE DELETED? One cardinal rule<br/>&gt;            would be to avoid expletives, or even &quot;innocent&quot; words<br/>&gt;            that may look and sound like expletives, in situations<br/>&gt;            where the tone might be perceived as less than jovial<br/>&gt;            (which includes lots of situations on groups in<br/>&gt;            cyberspace without visual or aural cues and immediate<br/>&gt;            feedback to clarify intentions).<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;            Thus there&apos;s a perfectly innocent term for a cetacean<br/>&gt;            respiratory passage or &quot;nostril&quot; that recently came up<br/>&gt;            here, and as applied figuratively to a human, properly<br/>&gt;            indicates one&apos;s mouth, especially when used for a large<br/>&gt;            quantity of speech. Personally I&apos;d try to take it as a<br/>&gt;            compliment, since having one of my longer posts compared<br/>&gt;            to a whale song in a nasal register might be an overly<br/>&gt;            generous review. But people&apos;s anatomical imaginations<br/>&gt;            can take other directions, especially when the context<br/>&gt;            of the term doesn&apos;t seem so friendly or complimentary.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;            If I had my druthers, language here would remain<br/>&gt;            decorous, but I must confess to enjoying all of Chaucer<br/>&gt;            and Boccaccio as well as Marguerite of Navarre, and to<br/>&gt;            &quot;eschewing censorship.&quot; An expletive now and then in<br/>&gt;            sheer exuberance or enthusiasm is harmless, but when<br/>&gt;            they&apos;re fired off in anger with another member as the<br/>&gt;            target, we&apos;re in the problem zone, and need to move out<br/>&gt;            of it decisively, starting now since yesterday is beyond<br/>&gt;            our power.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Please let me conclude by warmly thanking Carl for his services<br/>&gt; and participation over many years; Ozan, for his scholarship and<br/>&gt; wonderful posts on maqam music and much else, not to mention our<br/>&gt; many offline dialogues in which he has proven a gifted teacher<br/>&gt; and mentor; and all of us, for making this group possible, whose<br/>&gt; future we hold in our hands as its cooperative co-facilitators.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Most respectively,<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Margo Schulter<br/>&gt; mschulter@...<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; ------------------------------------<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; You can configure your subscription by sending an empty email to one<br/>&gt; of these addresses (from the address at which you receive the list):<br/>&gt;    <a href="mailto:tuning-subscribe@yahoogroups.com">tuning-subscribe@yahoogroups.com</a> - join the tuning group.<br/>&gt;    <a href="mailto:tuning-unsubscribe@yahoogroups.com">tuning-unsubscribe@yahoogroups.com</a> - leave the group.<br/>&gt;    <a href="mailto:tuning-nomail@yahoogroups.com">tuning-nomail@yahoogroups.com</a> - turn off mail from the group.<br/>&gt;    <a href="mailto:tuning-digest@yahoogroups.com">tuning-digest@yahoogroups.com</a> - set group to send daily digests.<br/>&gt;    <a href="mailto:tuning-normal@yahoogroups.com">tuning-normal@yahoogroups.com</a> - set group to send individual emails.<br/>&gt;    <a href="mailto:tuning-help@yahoogroups.com">tuning-help@yahoogroups.com</a> - receive general help information.<br/>&gt; Yahoo!
