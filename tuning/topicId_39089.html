If you can all remember, I first wrote to the group with the slightly controversial claim that the 12 tone equal temperament was not a compromise - and that only these 12 notes (with exact logarithmic spacing) were all that was needed for the best music.</p><p>I&apos;ve since tried to &apos;get used to&apos; certain perfect ratios, and particularly the Just tuned pitches. Using the computer, I also performed various experiments, but in the end, I still believe my original claim to be true.</p><p>In fact I almost got round to posting a poll with a few samples comparing 12-tET against Just. A few things stopped me though. I wanted to be sure of the best possible pitch/tune tests from which one could form a conclusion. This raises a few questions...</p><p>One test involved a simple rising scale. However, I was told that doing such a thing using the &apos;Just&apos; pitches in such a fashion was &apos;melodically awkward&apos; - so mean-tone would be better for this test. The thing is though, I really wanted the test to compare only the &apos;Just&apos; and 12-tET temperaments - as mean-tone is (certainly) a compromise in one way or another.<br/>Basically, my question is this:</p><p>What is the /furthest/ one can go before a &apos;tune&apos; using the &apos;Just&apos; pitches no longer becomes absolutely perfect?... For example, can one create a fairly complex chord with rippling notes, or is one confined to switching between octaves, perfect fifths, fourths and thirds? Remember, it can contain no pitch flaws (no matter how slight) whatsoever.</p><p>As a part of my own research, I compared the major chord from both temperaments:<br/>Just: 1.0, 1.25 &amp; 1.5 (0 Cents, 386.31 cents, &amp; 701.95 cents respectively)<br/>12-tET: 1.0, 1.25992 &amp; 1.4983 (0 Cents, 400 cents, &amp; 700 cents respectively)</p><p>At first, I used sine waves to experiment, and not surprisingly, they were very close, but in my opinion, the 12-tET major chord were sweeter and better sounding.<br/>I then tried the same test using a pure ramp wave. This is a &apos;harsher&apos; sound than the sine wave, and is reportedly more appropriate for these kind of experiments.</p><p>Interestingly, due to reasons of maths, I found the Just major chord to sound awful compared to 12-tET, but not because it was (too) off pitch - but because the sound timbre was very &apos;flat&apos;. The reason it sounds flat compared to 12-tET is due to the pitches being perfect ratios of each other.<br/>However, when using the apparently &apos;imperfect&apos; 12-tET pitches, despite the (supposedly bad) &apos;beats&apos; that it was producing, it of course sounded much better - thanks to the &apos;evolving&apos; timbre. This of course isn&apos;t any real evidence against the &apos;Just&apos; pitches - in fact - when I was testing using sine waves instead of ramp waves, both the Just pitches /and/ 12-tET sounded &apos;flat&apos;.</p><p>Anyway, I still wanted to test using the ramp wave, so now I had to find another test - which was this:</p><p>If the Just ratios/pitches really are sweeter sounding than 12-tET, then the &apos;other side&apos; of Just (even further away from 12-tET) should sound as &apos;bad&apos; as 12-tET itself (according to the people who prefer Just). Observe:</p><p>12-tET: 1.0, 1.25992 &amp; 1.4983 - (0 Cents, 400 cents, &amp; 700 cents respectively)<br/>Just: 1.0, 1.25 &amp; 1.5 - (0 Cents, 386.31 cents, &amp; 701.95 cents respectively)<br/>&apos;Other side of Just&apos;: 1.0, 1.24015 &amp; 1.5017 - (0 cents, 372.617 cents, &amp; 703.916 cents respectively)</p><p>1.24015 is gotten by 1.25/(1.25992/1.25)<br/>1.5017 is gotten by 1.5/(1.4983/1.5)</p><p>Cleverly, this new &apos;Other side of Just&apos; chord avoids the &apos;flat&apos; sound of the Just version, as now the timbre &apos;evolves&apos; just like the 12-tET chord. But how does it sound in terms of pitch?</p><p>Well, I&apos;m not sure about some of you, but I found this to sound dreadful, and obviously even worse than the Just chord. However, I could be wrong.<br/>To those who think that the sweetest sounding major chord is comprised of the pitches 1, 1.25 and 1.5 (Just), then this new chord should sound only as &apos;bad&apos; as 12-tET sounded in the first place. Does it?<br/>If anyone&apos;s interested, I&apos;ll post these different chords (in ramp, and sine wave format) up to the files section.</p><p>On top of all this, I still think dynamically altered (during the tune) Pythagoras pitches /also/ have a chance of being the best/sweetest pitches. I&apos;ll stop here though, as this is complex enough...</p><p>Cheers, Daniel</p><p><a href="http://www.skytopia.com">http://www.skytopia.com</a></p></div><h3><a id=39091 href="#39091">ðŸ”—</a>Gene Ward Smith &#x3C;genewardsmith@juno.com&#x3E;</h3><span>9/26/2002 3:12:48 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In tuning@y..., &quot;Daniel White&quot; &lt;soundburst@l...&gt; wrote:</p><p>&gt; Interestingly, due to reasons of maths, I found the Just major chord to sound awful compared to 12-tET, but not because it was (too) off pitch - but because the sound timbre was very &apos;flat&apos;.

However, this doesn&apos;t mean that there isn&apos;t a perfect scale from which to /deviate from/.</p><p>&gt;take a good solid week to become acclimated to<br/>&gt;the music of a culture with a significantly<br/>&gt;different tuning system -- modern arabic music<br/>&gt;would be a good example -- and don&apos;t listen to<br/>&gt;any western music at all during that week. now<br/>&gt;try your experiment again. i guarantee your<br/>&gt;reactions will be radically different!</p><p>Well, I wouldn&apos;t mind trying the test - hmm... maybe there&apos;s a specific favourite piece of music you&apos;d like to point me to one so I can try.

In other words, some tunes really are better/worse than other tunes (in different ways, and for different reasons - taking into account melody, intricacy, harmony, chords, orchestration, and even the &apos;lowest&apos; level - the wave itself (instrument timbre etc.). Perhaps there&apos;s even a formula to create good music, but no doubt it&apos;d be impossibly complex and certainly outside our reach for the time being :)<br/>Anyway, my point is that this &apos;Universal Aesthetic&apos; approach can be applied to scales too.</p><p>About the issue you mentioned of how (most) people prefer the Just intonation intervals, well... I&apos;m still not 100% convinced. As I said earlier, they could have got (wrongly) used to them. I admit /I/ could be the one who&apos;s wrong, but at the moment, there still seems too many discrepancies for me to think that 12-ET is a compromise and/or not the perfect/only tuning needed for all the best music.</p><p>And yes - Coconuts are (should be) universally tasty (logarithmic score: 65.8/120 ;-)</p><p>&gt;Go for Oum Kalthoum and try to pick out the<br/>&gt;quartertones.<br/>&gt;They are so organically integral to the music<br/>&gt;that all notes are fully legitimate as scale<br/>&gt;(or maqam) tones.</p><p>Hmmm.. once again sounds interesting, but at most, I should think that these quartertones would sound best off &apos;in between&apos; beats. More likely though that it&apos;s approaching a pseudo-atonal style with glimpses of actual 12-tET melody/harmony creeping in. (disclaimer - as usual I can&apos;t be 100% sure :)<br/>Umm...

I assume 12-equal was chosen because<br/>it is the smallest equal division of the octave which contains the<br/>traditional diatonic system.

(Schoenberg&apos;s _Harmonielehre_ was<br/>enormously important, historically.)</p><p>speaking historically, 12edo was indeed proposed and<br/>accepted as a compromise between other available and<br/>preferred tunings, and even Schoenberg said so, calling<br/>it &quot;an indefinitely extended truce&quot; between the just<br/>ratios and the practicalities of instrument construction,<br/>notation, etc.</p><p>as can be seen in my Tuning Dictionary definition<br/>&lt;<a href="http://groups.yahoo.com/group/monz/files/dict/12-eq.htm">http://groups.yahoo.com/group/monz/files/dict/12-eq.htm</a>&gt;<br/>12edo developed out of the much older Pythagorean<br/>(3-limit) tuning, by a simple tempering: viewed as a<br/>chain of &quot;5ths&quot;, the Pythagorean comma arises in comparison<br/>of the 13th pitch with the 1st, the 13th being about<br/>23.5 cents higher than the 1st.  if the comma is<br/>distributed among 12 pitches, the system becomes<br/>the closed 12-tone equal-temperament.</p><p>the fact that 12edo also functions as a meantone<br/>(~1/11-comma meantone), *and* a schismic temperament<br/>(similar to Groven&apos;s tuning but more limited), *and*<br/>a diesic temperament, *and* a tuning which fits into<br/>a whole host of other types of temperament families,<br/>*and* the fact that the pitch set is so small, helps<br/>to explain its widespread appeal.</p><p>12edo first became popular as a tuning for the lute<br/>and other fretted string instruments, c. 1500.  because<br/>of the fact that in those days frets were created by<br/>tying pieces of gut around the neck of the instrument,<br/>the frets had to go straight across the fingerboard.<br/>so the staggered frets needed for just-intonation were<br/>impossible then.</p><p>as an aside, i&apos;d also like to mention my speculations<br/>that 12edo could be as old as civilization itself:<br/><a href="http://groups.yahoo.com/group/monz/files/monzo/sumerian/sumeriantuning.htm">http://groups.yahoo.com/group/monz/files/monzo/sumerian/sumeriantuning.htm</a></p><p>in any case, with the widespread (and continuously<br/>growing) interest in microtonality, as well as a<br/>greater consciousness concerning faithfulness to the<br/>intended tunings of pre-Romantic-era composers, it<br/>seems rather pointless to me at this late date to<br/>try to shoehorn all the &quot;best&quot; music into 12edo.</p><p>in general, Renaissance vocal music sounds best in a<br/>form of adaptive-JI, Renaissance keyboard and Baroque<br/>orchestral music sounds best in meantone, Classical<br/>keyboard music sounds best in a well-temperament, and<br/>jazz sounds best in 12edo.  of course there are exceptions,<br/>but these were the intended tunings in these repertoires,<br/>and the music was written with the purpose of exploiting<br/>the particular tuning&apos;s characteristics.  and the better<br/>the music (and the composer), the better the tuning&apos;s<br/>characteristics are exploited, and thus the more important<br/>it is to render that repertoire in the intended tuning.</p><p>as an experiment, i&apos;d love to hear you retune some of<br/>Harry Partch&apos;s music into 12edo and tell me how much<br/>you think you&apos;ve &quot;improved&quot; it.  i tried it once with<br/>_Barstow_, and trust me, it wasn&apos;t better.</p><p>-monz<br/>&quot;all roads lead to n^0&quot;</p></div><h3><a id=39131 href="#39131">ðŸ”—</a>prophecyspirit@aol.com</h3><span>9/29/2002 9:26:01 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>In a message dated 9/29/02 8:52:58 AM Central Daylight Time,<br/><a href="mailto:kalleaho@mappi.helsinki.fi">kalleaho@mappi.helsinki.fi</a> writes:</p><p>&gt;  I don&apos;t prefer justness.</p><p>Kalle,</p><p>I believe why some don&apos;t prefer perfect just tuning is because it&apos;s<br/>unnatural. It doesn&apos;t occur in the natural harmonic spectrum to any extent.<br/>As the exact harmonic intervals produced depend on many variables--how the<br/>tones are produced, the sound-producing material, weather, temperature,<br/>biometric pressure, sound strength, and so forth. Thus, when just tuning is<br/>produced to its exact theoretical values, it&apos;s still not a natural sound!</p><p>To sound natural just intonation needs to be detuned slightly up to 2 cents<br/>+/- the theoretical values. The result is just temperament, not theoretical<br/>just intonation. The exact amount of detuning depends on how the scale and<br/>what scale is produced.</p><p>The tones in my just-temperament organ are produced by frequency-divider tone<br/>generators tuned to ET.  Presently there are six of them. Theoretically there<br/>should be eight. As the stops are split at Middle C to provide the greatest<br/>stop selection.</p><p>On each keyboard half one tone generator is tuned to C. +/- 0 cents, another<br/>to E +/- 386, and another to 7 Bb +/- 969 cents. There should be another<br/>tuned to +/- 155 cents for 7 D, to provide a harmonic 7th for E.</p><p>The present value for C and its 5ths circle is 0 cents (making the 5ths worth<br/>700 cents), E and its 5ths circle 384 cents and 7 Bb and its 5ths circle 968<br/>cents.</p><p>The minor 7th for E and its 5ths circle is presently 168 cents. This produces<br/>a large minor 7th for E and its 5ths circle worth 984 cents. This is taken<br/>from the 30/17 harmonic ratio worth 983 cents. This compromise was made<br/>presently because the E 386 cents harmonic minor 7th and its 5ths circle is<br/>rarely used in any given composition. And because it would cost me several<br/>hundred dollars to add two more tone generators.</p><p>The final result is the practical just-temperament scale and its keyboard<br/>layout I posted here some time back. For a given key signature there are 19<br/>notes to the octave. So split digitals were added to each keyboard to provide<br/>the extra seven notes. These are rarely used in a given composition, but need<br/>to be instantly available when needed.</p><p>In fact I don&apos;t think there is an Ideal &gt; System.</p><p>I believe my just temperament scale is as ideal as one can make for a<br/>keyboard instrument! Even the diminished harmonic-minor 7th chord is<br/>harmonious--worth 884 cents.</p><p>Sincerely,<br/>Pauline W.

The thing is, I believe that such arabic music would sound<br/>better to everyone (eventually) if it was fully converted to 12-tET.</p><p>In response to this, let me relate something from my past experience.</p><p>When I first investigated alternative tuning systems in 1963, one of<br/>the things I did was to retune my electronic organ to the meantone<br/>temperament, which is practically the same thing as a subset of 31-<br/>ET.  This was in the days before digital music electronics, and<br/>lacking an electronic tuning aid, I did the tuning by timing the<br/>beating fifths against a metronome, after calculating the beat rates<br/>using logarithm tables.  It was very time-consuming, but the result<br/>was quite accurate.</p><p>I kept the organ tuned this way for several weeks and was absolutely<br/>delighted with the way older organ music (such as Bach and Handel)<br/>sounded, as long as I didn&apos;t try to make enharmonic substitutions (in<br/>order to avoid the &quot;wolf&quot; fifth).  Particularly intriguing was the<br/>fact that augmented seconds and diminished sevenths sounded different<br/>from (i.e., more dissonant than) minor thirds and major sixths,<br/>something that we don&apos;t have with 12-ET.</p><p>But I did miss the ability to modulate freely, and so I put the organ<br/>back into 12-ET.  I was totally unprepared for the shock that I<br/>received when, after playing no more than two or three chords, I<br/>found my ears literally assaulted by dissonant triads that would find<br/>no resolution or rest until, in desperation, I omitted the third of<br/>the chord, leaving an open fifth.  In meantone I could easily flee<br/>the wolf by playing in another key, but in 12-ET there was no<br/>escape.  Not only did the thirds and sixths have a jarring effect,<br/>but everything sounded out of tune.  It suddenly became obvious to me<br/>why organs were not generally tuned in equal temperament in England<br/>until after 1850; if I found the change hard to accept after only a<br/>few weeks in meantone, how difficult it must have been for those who<br/>had spent all their lives with it to put up with 12-ET, in which you<br/>have three times the error in the major and minor triads.</p><p>The out-of-tune sensation of equal temperament left me after a short<br/>while, but I have never been satisfied with its unending dissonance<br/>since that time.  I soon solved the problem by devising a well-<br/>temperament that would give me more consonant-sounding triads in at<br/>least a few keys, until such time as I was able to obtain an<br/>instrument with more than twelve keys per octave.  So I now have the<br/>meantone sound in 31 different keys (plus 7 and 11 harmony).</p><p>By the way, if you intend to conduct this sort of experiment<br/>yourself, you need to use timbres with harmonic partials -- sine<br/>waves or bells won&apos;t do.</p><p>&gt; &gt;justness may strike you as &quot;sweet&quot; or it may strike you as &quot;dull<br/>and lifeless&quot;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Well, off pitch is more like it ;) Lifeless/Flatness etc. is<br/>conditional not on the pitch - but the timbre and wave evolution of<br/>the sound I would&apos;ve thought...</p><p>The lifeless or stagnant effect that some have objected to with just<br/>intonation is a result of the absence of disturbances caused by<br/>beating harmonics or non-coincident combinational tones, so interval<br/>size has a lot to do with it.</p><p>But any lack of life you might perceive in just intonation with sine<br/>waves would have more to do with the just major third being smaller,<br/>which makes the leading lower in pitch and less effective<br/>melodically.  If you were to try 17-ET with sine waves; I suspect you<br/>would find that it makes 12-ET sound lifeless and bland by<br/>comparison.  (At least that has been my experience with it.)  So I<br/>would say that 12-ET is about as good melodically as it is<br/>harmonically -- a compromise that does both about equally well (or<br/>badly, depending on your point of view).</p><p>&gt; ---------<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Hi prophecyspirit,<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;Mutation stops on pipe organs are tuned to just intonation.<br/>&gt; &gt;When the rest of the organ is tuned to ET, the 1 3/5&apos;<br/>&gt; &gt;stops are way out of tune with the major thirds!<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Interesting. If my theory is right then, it&apos;s a pity that the<br/>Mutation stops can&apos;t also be tuned to 12-eT...</p><p>Well, they could, but then they wouldn&apos;t be in a true harmonic<br/>relationship with the pipes sounding the fundamental pitch and would<br/>beat against the harmonics of those pipes, causing each and every<br/>single note to be literally out of tune all by itself.</p><p>&gt; &gt;Any theoretical just interval can be tuned +/- 2<br/>&gt; &gt;cents the theoretical value and still sound normal<br/>&gt; &gt;to the ear. And +/- 3 cents still sounds in tune,<br/>&gt; &gt;but has a celeste (vibrato) quality. Any greater<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Interesting. Do those values apply for the vibrato effect too?</p><p>The beating of the thirds in 12-ET is so fast that it&apos;s not even a<br/>vibrato; I would describe it as more of a grating effect.  But you<br/>don&apos;t fully realize how bad it is until you&apos;ve spent a little time<br/>with something that has (harmonically) better thirds.</p><p>&gt; &gt;out-of-tuneness destroys the natural Difference<br/>&gt; &gt;and Sumational Combinational tomes. These are<br/>&gt; &gt;obviously destroyed, or at the wrong pitch, via<br/>&gt; &gt;ET tuning!<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I would argue the exact same thing - but against<br/>&gt; Just tuning instead :)</p><p>You can&apos;t.  In JI the combinational tones are in exact mathematical<br/>relationship with the fundamental, but in 12-ET they&apos;re quite<br/>discordant (by practically anyone&apos;s definition of the term).  This is<br/>in addition to the fast-beating harmonics in the thirds, so 12-ET<br/>leaves a lot to be desired.</p><p>It looks like the only way to convince you is to have you try<br/>something like my meantone experiment.</p><p>--George</p></div><h3><a id=39154 href="#39154">ðŸ”—</a>David Beardsley &#x3C;davidbeardsley@biink.com&#x3E;</h3><span>10/1/2002 5:54:04 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Explain how a tuning can be both Just and Tempered?</p><p>I thought it&apos;s either Just OR Tempered.</p><p>* David Beardsley<br/>* <a href="http://biink.com">http://biink.com</a><br/>* <a href="http://mp3.com/davidbeardsley">http://mp3.com/davidbeardsley</a></p></div><h3><a id=39156 href="#39156">ðŸ”—</a>prophecyspirit@aol.com</h3><span>10/1/2002 7:40:32 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>In a message dated 10/1/02 7:56:24 AM Central Daylight Time,<br/><a href="mailto:davidbeardsley@biink.com">davidbeardsley@biink.com</a> writes:</p><p>&gt; Explain how a tuning can be both Just and Tempered?<br/>&gt; I thought it&apos;s either Just OR Tempered.<br/>&gt;<br/>An interval is just when it&apos;s within the limits the ear accepts as just,<br/>which for intervals other than the octave is +/- 2 cents.

I can hear justness</p><p>Hmm.. the intervals on their &apos;own&apos; (either as a chord or sequence) sound &apos;o=<br/>k&apos;, which is what would be expected really... It&apos;s when the notes are put in=<br/>to (good) intricate harmonious/melodic music, when they really become specia=<br/>l :)</p><p>&gt;if the ratios are sufficiently simple and timbre is pretty static,<br/>&gt;but I don&apos;t prefer justness. In fact I don&apos;t think there is an Ideal<br/>&gt;System. Why do you think there must be such a thing?</p><p>I guess maybe for the same reason I also believe that every piece of music =<br/>can be &apos;rated&apos;...<br/>Also, I suppose most in this group would think that Just (or near Just) pit=<br/>ches are best for harmony in 12 note music (correct me if I&apos;m wrong). I&apos;m no=<br/>t sure if I agree with that (as you all well know ;), but the point is that =<br/>there must be (mathematical) reasons why certain pitches/intervals are bette=<br/>r than others.</p><p>&gt;It&apos;s your claim, you&apos;ve got the burden of proof too.</p><p>Hehe - proof is such a difficult (but perhaps not impossible) thing in the =<br/>world of music =)</p><p>-------</p><p>Hi Prophecyspirit,</p><p>&gt;The problem with ET tuning is that no matter how the<br/>&gt;intervals are tuned, the harmonic spectrums created<br/>&gt;by the notes involved, when produced by wind or<br/>&gt;string instrumens or sung, are nontheless naturally<br/>&gt;tuned to just intonation!</p><p>If by &apos;harmonic spectrums&apos;, you&apos;re referring to the harmonic overtones, the=<br/>n I think I see your point. Perhaps the reason why certain instruments (such=<br/> as pianos and organs) might sound better with tunings slightly different to=<br/> exact 12-ET - is that maybe one should also consider the overtones.<br/>It wouldn&apos;t surprise me if these instruments cause the subtle overtones to =<br/>clash with the fundamental tones of 12-eT. If this really is the case, then =<br/>the problem isn&apos;t specifically with 12-eT, but rather with the overtones tha=<br/>t a particular instrument produces - meaning that 12-eT possibly isn&apos;t a com=<br/>promise after all.<br/>A &apos;perfect instrument&apos; could avoid these (what I think are) problems, if cr=<br/>eated mathematically from the ground up (synthesizer style). Any &apos;overtones&apos;=<br/> created could also be tuned to 12-eT.</p><p>This is really getting complicated now that overtone harmonics come into th=<br/>e equation :)</p><p>---------</p><p>Hi Fran&ccedil;ois Laferri&egrave;re,</p><p>&gt;IMHO claim that 12ET represents a sort of natural perfection is<br/>&gt;disproved by a simple fact: 12ET thirds are nearly impossible to sign<br/>&gt;in harmony! In cadential context, when there is enough time to settle<br/>&gt;a perfect chord, even average amateur singers are strongly attracted<br/>&gt;to JI third.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;Try this very simple experiment, play any note on a piano, sustain it,<br/>&gt;sign the third, sustain it for a few seconds, then play the third on<br/>&gt;the piano. Result: most people are too low (by some 15 cents) wrt to<br/>&gt;piano. That works nearly all the time for nearly anybody with minimal<br/>&gt;musical training.</p><p>Yes, but amateur singers are more likely to get it wrong ;-)</p><p>To be honest, you make a strong case, and as I have said previously, I&apos;m st=<br/>ill not 100% sure.<br/>Now these are only theories, so don&apos;t jump on them, but:</p><p>A: Maybe the singers used in any experiment were &apos;wavering&apos;, and they presu=<br/>med that they were hitting 1.25 instead of 1.259 (perhaps by taking the &apos;tro=<br/>ugh&apos; of the pitch instead of the middle or peak). These two pitches are very=<br/> close, so it can be very hard to tell.</p><p>B: Also, it could&apos;ve been that maybe the singer was (mistakingly) /aiming/ =<br/>for chords which didn&apos;t beat rather than for what actually sounded best.</p><p>C: Thirdly, as I&apos;ve said in reply to Prophecyspirit, they might be hitting =<br/>this beatless pitch to be in harmony with the (imo) faulty harmonic overtone=<br/>s that certain instruments produce - rather than in harmony with the fundame=<br/>ntal pitch. This could certainly be plausible.</p><p>D: Due to the acoustic properties of both the human voice and instrument in=<br/> question, maybe there&apos;s a quasi-mathematical &apos;sound effect&apos; (like some kind=<br/> of subtle &apos;wowowow&apos;) that enhances the interval if sung in Just (1.25). Thi=<br/>s though is more of an side-effect, and I guess this &apos;sound effect&apos; could be=<br/> mathematically synthesized and added to the 1.259 interval too if necessary=<br/> - then you would have the best of both worlds.</p><p>E: Finally, perhaps the singers involved didn&apos;t quite hit the exact pitch t=<br/>hat they should have done anyway - especially if they were &apos;trained&apos; to hit =<br/>1.25 - or even &apos;not trained enough&apos; to hit 1.259</p><p>It could be one of these...or any mix of these.</p><p>-----------</p><p>Hi George,</p><p>&gt;I was totally unprepared for the shock that I<br/>&gt;received when, after playing no more than two or three chords, I<br/>&gt;found my ears literally assaulted by dissonant triads that would find<br/>&gt;no resolution or rest until, in desperation, I omitted the third of<br/>&gt;the chord, leaving an open fifth. In meantone I could easily flee<br/>&gt;the wolf by playing in another key, but in 12-ET there was no<br/>&gt;escape. Not only did the thirds and sixths have a jarring effect,<br/>&gt;but everything sounded out of tune. It suddenly became obvious to me<br/>&gt;why organs were not generally tuned in equal temperament in England<br/>&gt;until after 1850;</p><p>But maybe this could be explained by the &apos;tolerance margin&apos; that one can bu=<br/>ild up over time. To myself, Just intervals grate - not 12-eT. Also, the oth=<br/>er possiblity could be thanks to point C in my previous reply.<br/>Interesting story btw.</p><p>&gt;But any lack of life you might perceive in just intonation with sine<br/>&gt;waves would have more to do with the just major third being smaller,<br/>&gt;which makes the leading lower in pitch and less effective<br/>&gt;melodically. If you were to try 17-ET with sine waves; I suspect you<br/>&gt;would find that it makes 12-ET sound lifeless and bland by<br/>&gt;comparison. (At least that has been my experience with it.) So I</p><p>Well, I don&apos;t really mind the flatness too much (which can be countered by =<br/>having a decent vibrato anyway, complex timbre, or going slightly above &apos;Jus=<br/>t&apos; as a few have suggested in this thread). It&apos;s the pitch itself I have pro=<br/>blems with :)</p><p>&gt;would say that 12-ET is about as good melodically as it is<br/>&gt;harmonically -- a compromise that does both about equally well (or<br/>&gt;badly, depending on your point of view).</p><p>Maybe I&apos;m mistaken, but I think I recall someone in this group saying how f=<br/>or /melodic/ purposes, 12-eT is perfect, whilst harmonically it isn&apos;t perfec=<br/>t (well, he got one of those right ;)...</p><p>&gt;&gt; I would argue the exact same thing - but against<br/>&gt;&gt; Just tuning instead :)</p><p>&gt;You can&apos;t. In JI the combinational tones are in exact mathematical<br/>&gt;relationship with the fundamental, but in 12-ET they&apos;re quite<br/>&gt;discordant (by practically anyone&apos;s definition of the term). This is<br/>&gt;in addition to the fast-beating harmonics in the thirds, so 12- ET<br/>&gt;leaves a lot to be desired.</p><p>Once again, I can understand that logically speaking - &apos;rational&apos; numbers s=<br/>eem as though they are the best option, but there&apos;s always a chance they mig=<br/>ht not be.<br/>Remember that even PI is an irrational number, but is a very important numb=<br/>er in mathematics. The &apos;imperfect&apos; beating of course is a by-product from th=<br/>e irrational numbers, but perhaps ultimately not one which is of any signifi=<br/>cance. Maybe the ear really wants to hear &apos;irrational&apos; logarithmic intervals=<br/>...</p><p>&gt;It looks like the only way to convince you is to have you try<br/>&gt;something like my meantone experiment.</p><p>Hmm.. maybe you could put up something on the web?<br/>In the mean time, do you know of a comparison anywhere on the web which dem=<br/>onstrates a good (say... classical) tune with examples of 12-eT vs Just tuni=<br/>ng?

In meantone I could easily flee<br/>&gt; &gt;the wolf by playing in another key, but in 12-ET there was no<br/>&gt; &gt;escape. Not only did the thirds and sixths have a jarring effect,<br/>&gt; &gt;but everything sounded out of tune. It suddenly became obvious to<br/>me<br/>&gt; &gt;why organs were not generally tuned in equal temperament in England<br/>&gt; &gt;until after 1850;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; But maybe this could be explained by the &apos;tolerance margin&apos; that<br/>one can bu=<br/>&gt; ild up over time.

In cadential context, when there is enough time to<br/>settle<br/>&gt;&gt;a perfect chord, even average amateur singers are strongly attracted<br/>&gt;&gt;to JI third.<br/>&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt;Try this very simple experiment, play any note on a piano, sustain<br/>it,<br/>&gt;&gt;sign the third, sustain it for a few seconds, then play the third on<br/>&gt;&gt;the piano. Result: most people are too low (by some 15 cents) wrt to<br/>&gt;&gt;piano. That works nearly all the time for nearly anybody with<br/>minimal<br/>&gt;&gt;musical training.</p><p>Daniel:<br/>&gt;Yes, but amateur singers are more likely to get it wrong ;-)</p><p>&gt;To be honest, you make a strong case, and as I have said previously,<br/>I&apos;m st=<br/>&gt;ill not 100% sure.<br/>&gt;Now these are only theories, so don&apos;t jump on them, but:</p><p>&gt;A: Maybe the singers used in any experiment were &apos;wavering&apos;, and they<br/>presu=<br/>&gt;med that they were hitting 1.25 instead of 1.259 (perhaps by taking<br/>the &apos;tro=<br/>&gt;ugh&apos; of the pitch instead of the middle or peak). These two pitches<br/>are very=<br/>&gt;close, so it can be very hard to tell.</p><p>I took a few measurements of final major chords of professional a<br/>capella ensemble,<br/>(renaissance music, so to be honest, there may be a bias in the style<br/>of the<br/>performers). The major third is definitely around 385 cents more or<br/>less a few<br/>cents (the accuracy limit of my measures), and not around let say 375<br/>or 415.</p><p>&gt;B: Also, it could&apos;ve been that maybe the singer was (mistakingly)<br/>/aiming/ =<br/>&gt;for chords which didn&apos;t beat rather than for what actually sounded<br/>best.</p><p>What singers aim to, isn&apos;t what sound the best (to them at least)?<br/>Furthermore,<br/>I initially tought that the search of beatless sound was the key to a<br/>capella JI.<br/>Then I realised that for signing voices, the higher harmonics are<br/>relatively<br/>blunt (compared to fixed tuning instruments) for harmonics higher<br/>than, let say<br/>third or fourth. This is probably due to vibrato (even the slightest<br/>one) and/or<br/>the softness of vocal tract tissues. Whatever is the reason, this<br/>makes the<br/>beating of voices very difficult to detect directly and unlikely to be<br/>the primary clue<br/>to JI or not JI.</p><p>&gt;C: Thirdly, as I&apos;ve said in reply to Prophecyspirit, they might be<br/>hitting =<br/>&gt;this beatless pitch to be in harmony with the (imo) faulty harmonic<br/>overtone=<br/>&gt;s that certain instruments produce - rather than in harmony with the<br/>fundame=<br/>&gt;ntal pitch. This could certainly be plausible.</p><p>Attraction to JI third exists for a capella singing and probably for<br/>any<br/>instrument capable of pitch adaptation. Further, even the most<br/>reputedly inharmonic instrument, the piano, is not THAT inharmonic in<br/>the mid<br/>range: not enough (IMHO) to make account of the &quot;missing&quot; 15 cents of<br/>song thirds.</p><p>&gt;D: Due to the acoustic properties of both the human voice and<br/>instrument in=<br/>&gt;question, maybe there&apos;s a quasi-mathematical &apos;sound effect&apos; (like<br/>some kind=<br/>&gt;of subtle &apos;wowowow&apos;) that enhances the interval if sung in Just<br/>(1.25). Thi=<br/>&gt;s though is more of an side-effect, and I guess this &apos;sound effect&apos;<br/>could be=<br/>&gt;mathematically synthesized and added to the 1.259 interval too if<br/>necessary=<br/>&gt;- then you would have the best of both worlds.</p><p>&gt;E: Finally, perhaps the singers involved didn&apos;t quite hit the exact<br/>pitch t=<br/>&gt;hat they should have done anyway - especially if they were &apos;trained&apos;<br/>to hit =<br/>&gt;1.25 - or even &apos;not trained enough&apos; to hit 1.259</p><p>Amateur singers I know are not trained to sign this kind or this other<br/>kind of third.<br/>Nearly none of them are even aware that there is some other interval<br/>than those found<br/>on the piano. They usually rehearse with a piano, but just thirds pop<br/>out naturally<br/>when in proper condition (a capella, decent room accoustic, long<br/>triadic chords)</p><p>What I have observed (measured in fact, I do not have such good ear)<br/>for<br/>a capella ensemble is that the initial value of thirds is often<br/>near ET third, but given some time (up to few seconds depending of the<br/>skill of the<br/>signers) for the chord to settle, the third shrinks toward 385 cents.</p><p>That suggest that the mental image of the chord, before utterance, is<br/>ET<br/>(due IMHO to cultural pervasiveness of ET), then, performers settle to<br/>more &quot;natural&quot; interval.</p><p>Obviously, this is probably not true for any genre. Some kind of<br/>roughness<br/>may be seeked, and so, deviation from JI is part of the style.

Due to<br/>the complex mathematical interactions on air, traditional instruments<br/>have a great sound quality, but obviously it&apos;s a limitation that<br/>their natural harmonics can&apos;t be altered so easily.</p><p>-----------------------------------</p><p>Hi George,</p><p>&gt;&gt; But maybe this could be explained by the &apos;tolerance margin&apos; that<br/>&gt;&gt; one can bu=<br/>&gt;&gt; ild up over time. To myself, Just intervals grate - not 12- eT.<br/>&gt;&gt; Also, the oth=<br/>&gt;&gt; er possiblity could be thanks to point C in my previous reply.<br/>&gt;&gt; Interesting story btw.</p><p>&gt;Since we were trying to convince you that 12-ET is not &quot;best&quot;, it is<br/>&gt;only necessary to establish that there is something &quot;better&quot;; whether<br/>&gt;this might be JI or another temperament is secondary. Since you have<br/>&gt;an objection to JI, I was trying to direct your attention to meantone<br/>&gt;temperament or 31-ET (its virtual equivalent), which I don&apos;t think<br/>&gt;anyone has ever described as harsh or grating (as long as you avoid<br/>&gt;the wolf).<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;The point that I was attempting to make is that, while I was very<br/>&gt;shocked when I again used 12-ET after several weeks of playing<br/>&gt;exclusively in meantone, I had a very delightful experience when I<br/>&gt;first played in meantone temperament after years of playing<br/>&gt;exclusively in 12-ET. Surely this must say that something other than<br/>&gt;a &quot;tolerance margin&quot; would be the primary consideration here.</p><p>Fair enough. Like you say, &apos;Tolerance&apos; would seem to have little or<br/>nothing to do with it. The only other possiblities then, might be<br/>something to do with some kind of timbre phenomenon (possibly<br/>specific to your keyboard) - or maybe the fact that your ears<br/>simply &apos;prefer&apos; mean-toned temperament. Also, if the overtone<br/>harmonics of the instrument timbre was (unavoidably) strongly tuned<br/>towards JI, then this could make them clash with the fundamental<br/>tones or with each other.</p><p>&gt;&gt; Maybe I&apos;m mistaken, but I think I recall someone in this group<br/>&gt;&gt; saying how for /melodic/ purposes, 12-eT is perfect, whilst<br/>&gt;&gt; harmonically it isn&apos;t perfect (well, he got one of those<br/>right ;)...</p><p>&gt;There is considerable evidence to suggest that raising the leading<br/>&gt;tone tends to improve the effect of its resolution to the tonic, both<br/>&gt;melodically *and* harmonically(!). (I wrote an article which was<br/>&gt;accepted for publication in the next issue of Xenharmonikon in which<br/>&gt;I elaborate on the effectiveness of a harmonically dissonant leading<br/>&gt;tone.)</p><p>Interesting.</p><p>&gt;I was thinking of an experiment in which you were to *listen* to what<br/>&gt;you were *playing* so that you could try out as many different things<br/>&gt;as possible in the new tuning. (The problem with today&apos;s digital<br/>&gt;electronic instruments is that you have to have one that allows you<br/>&gt;to retune the notes individually.) But if you&apos;re only going to<br/>&gt;listen to something and not do the actual playing, then try to listen</p><p>It wouldn&apos;t be too easy to retune my keyboard (if at all possible),<br/>but I would assume it&apos;s better to concentrate just by listening -<br/>rather than playing aswell.</p><p>&gt;to a number of things in the same tuning (I suggested meantone<br/>&gt;temperament) for a number of times over a period of a couple of weeks<br/>&gt;before you go back and listen to the *same thing(s)* (in the same<br/>&gt;timbres) in 12-ET.</p><p>I have done exactly this =) See below for details.</p><p>-----------------------------------------</p><p>Hi wallyesterpaulrus,</p><p>&gt;&gt; In the mean time, do you know of a comparison anywhere on the web<br/>&gt;&gt; which demonstrates a good (say... classical) tune with examples of<br/>&gt;&gt; 12-eT vs Just tuning? I should imagine the web is filled with<br/>&gt;&gt; such comparisons - all waiting to prove me wrong! ;D</p><p>&gt;it&apos;s obvious that you&apos;ll always prefer the 12-equal versions, because<br/>&gt;your brain has been &quot;tuned&quot;, you might say, to the 12-equal pitches.</p><p>I should hope that&apos;s because they are /best/ tuned that way ;)</p><p>&gt;but here goes anyway. this is adaptive tuning, not just, but it tries<br/>&gt;to make the chords as just as possible within themselves. spend a lot<br/>&gt;of time with these before commenting:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<a href="http://bellsouthpwp.net/j/d/jdelaub/jstudio.htm">http://bellsouthpwp.net/j/d/jdelaub/jstudio.htm</a></p><p>As I write this letter, I&apos;m listening to the examples presented on<br/>the page. In fact I&apos;ve been been doing this for the past couple of<br/>weeks - with as minimal &apos;exposure&apos; to 12-eT as possible (quite hard<br/>in this day and age one might find ;)</p><p>As expected, I found it off-tune at first, but I&apos;ll see if I can<br/>really get to prefer it. I somehow still suspect that I won&apos;t, but<br/>I&apos;m going to keep an open mind about this - since obviously many seem<br/>to think otherwise. I&apos;ll be posting the results here soon.</p><p>&gt;and yes, wonderful things, such as the hammond organ, have been<br/>&gt;acheived by simply retuning the overtones to 12-equal. even 11- equal<br/>&gt;and 13-equal, which are extremely far from just intonation, have been<br/>&gt;made to sound &quot;smooth&quot;, by Bill Sethares and Jacky Ligon, among<br/>&gt;others -- by tuning the overtones, as well as fundamentals, to the<br/>&gt;equal tuning in question.</p><p>If this is true, then /not/ tuning the overtones to 12-equal is what<br/>I really think half (or possibly all) the problem is - with the claim<br/>that 12-eT isn&apos;t perfect.<br/>About 11 and 13 equal.... ermm - I&apos;ll leave that argument for another<br/>day... ;D</p><p>&gt;on the other hand, as a musical being i *know* that all sorts of<br/>&gt;weird-ass scales can come to sound &quot;perfect&quot;, in the right musical<br/>&gt;contexts, and from that point of view the idea of one &quot;perfect&quot;<br/>&gt;musical scale is both absurd and very sad from the point of view of<br/>&gt;diminishing musical richness.</p><p>Not necessarily - music is based on &apos;limits&apos; all the time.<br/>There are so many possibilities in 12-eT unexplored. I would say<br/>music so far has really only begun to scratch the surface, as even in<br/>the best classical symphonies (for example), there are subtle<br/>chord &apos;mistakes&apos; and continuations in the melody/arrangement that<br/>could be improved further.<br/>Taking this to the extreme, theoretically, the best music would be<br/>tailored right down to the wave - and the individual 0.001<br/>second &apos;nuggets&apos; that ultimately make all music up.</p><p>---------------------------------------------------------</p><p>Hi Francois,</p><p>&gt;I took a few measurements of final major chords of professional a<br/>&gt;capella ensemble, (renaissance music, so to be honest, there may be<br/>&gt;a bias in the style of the performers). The major third is definitely<br/>&gt;around 385 cents more or less a few cents (the accuracy limit of my<br/>&gt;measures), and not around let say 375 or 415.</p><p>Fair enough. For an accurate and objective measurement, I take it<br/>there wasn&apos;t much vibrato in their voices at the time?</p><p>&gt;&gt;B: Also, it could&apos;ve been that maybe the singer was (mistakingly)<br/>&gt;&gt;/aiming/ for chords which didn&apos;t beat rather than for what actually<br/>sounded<br/>&gt;&gt;best.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;What singers aim to, isn&apos;t what sound the best (to them at least)?<br/>&gt;Furthermore,<br/>&gt;I initially tought that the search of beatless sound was the key to a<br/>&gt;capella JI.<br/>&gt;Then I realised that for signing voices, the higher harmonics are<br/>&gt;relatively<br/>&gt;blunt (compared to fixed tuning instruments) for harmonics higher<br/>&gt;than, let say<br/>&gt;third or fourth. This is probably due to vibrato (even the slightest<br/>&gt;one) and/or<br/>&gt;the softness of vocal tract tissues. Whatever is the reason, this<br/>&gt;makes the beating of voices very difficult to detect directly and<br/>&gt;unlikely to be the primary clue to JI or not JI.</p><p>Interesting, but as faint as a singers&apos; harmonic overtones are, I<br/>would&apos;ve thought many (including the singers) could tell if their<br/>harmonic overtones are in &apos;tune&apos; with each other - even if on a<br/>subconscious level.<br/>I would love to hear human voices sing in harmony, but with the<br/>tones /and/ overtones tuned exactly to 12-equal :) This would then<br/>avoid the &apos;roughness&apos; that you mentioned is sometimes &apos;preferable&apos; in<br/>certain kinds of music.</p><p>&gt;&gt;C: Thirdly, as I&apos;ve said in reply to Prophecyspirit, they might be<br/>&gt;&gt;hitting<br/>&gt;&gt;this beatless pitch to be in harmony with the (imo) faulty harmonic<br/>&gt;&gt;overtones that certain instruments produce - rather than in harmony<br/>&gt;&gt;with the fundamental pitch. This could certainly be plausible.</p><p>&gt;Attraction to JI third exists for a capella singing and probably for<br/>&gt;any instrument capable of pitch adaptation. Further, even the most<br/>&gt;reputedly inharmonic instrument, the piano, is not THAT inharmonic in<br/>&gt;the mid range: not enough (IMHO) to make account of the &quot;missing&quot;<br/>&gt;15 cents of song thirds.</p><p>But possibly enough for the brain to (maybe subconsciously) recognise<br/>a certain &apos;off-tune&apos; sound when the sub-harmonics &apos;clash&apos; against the<br/>fundamentals/each other (&apos;roughness&apos;)...?</p><p>&gt;&gt;D: Due to the acoustic properties of both the human voice and<br/>&gt;&gt;instrument in question, maybe there&apos;s a quasi-mathematical &apos;sound<br/>&gt;&gt;effect&apos; (like some kind of subtle &apos;wowowow&apos;) that enhances the<br/>&gt;&gt;interval if sung in Just (1.25). This though is more of an<br/>&gt;&gt;side-effect, and I guess this &apos;sound effect&apos; could be mathematically<br/>&gt;&gt;synthesized and added to the 1.259 interval too if necessary -<br/>&gt;&gt;then you would have the best of both worlds.<br/>&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt;E: Finally, perhaps the singers involved didn&apos;t quite hit the exact<br/>&gt;&gt;pitch t=<br/>&gt;&gt;hat they should have done anyway - especially if they were &apos;trained&apos;<br/>&gt;&gt;to hit =<br/>&gt;&gt;1.25 - or even &apos;not trained enough&apos; to hit 1.259</p><p>&gt;Amateur singers I know are not trained to sign this kind or this<br/>other<br/>&gt;kind of third. Nearly none of them are even aware that there is some<br/>&gt;other interval than those found<br/>&gt;on the piano. They usually rehearse with a piano, but just thirds pop<br/>&gt;out naturally<br/>&gt;when in proper condition (a capella, decent room accoustic, long<br/>&gt;triadic chords)<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;What I have observed (measured in fact, I do not have such good ear)<br/>&gt;for<br/>&gt;a capella ensemble is that the initial value of thirds is often<br/>&gt;near ET third, but given some time (up to few seconds depending of<br/>the<br/>&gt;skill of the signers) for the chord to settle, the third shrinks<br/>toward 385 cents.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;That suggest that the mental image of the chord, before utterance, is<br/>&gt;ET (due IMHO to cultural pervasiveness of ET), then, performers<br/>settle<br/>&gt;to more &quot;natural&quot; interval.</p><p>As well as the previous &quot;overtones clashing with fundamentals&quot;<br/>or &quot;subtle quasi-mathematical &apos;wowowow&apos;&quot; syndromes, this could be<br/>explained by something else; Singing in Just intonation might be<br/>easier for the &apos;singing&apos; brain to cope with.

Of course, he&apos;s also become<br/>a *microtonalist* so that might &quot;color&quot; his view (literally) in your<br/>opinion (Interview is with Bruce Duffie):</p><p>&quot;BD: Is there any end to musical possibility?</p><p>EB: Oh, eventually there is, but we&apos;re not there yet. At this point,<br/>I am persuaded that the tonal and harmonic resources of the 12 note<br/>equal scale have, in fact, been discovered and exploited. And I think<br/>that&apos;s something that only came true in about 1965 or 1970. After<br/>that, it&apos;s been some kind of a rehash of what&apos;s been done before. So<br/>the last frontier to be breached is the atonal polyrhythmic idiom,<br/>and there&apos;s a vast repertoire in that idiom that begins somewhere<br/>around 1948, just to pick a random year...</p><p>BD: But I thought you said that this was dead!</p><p>EB: Well, it&apos;s dead now. It went on till about 1965. There&apos;s a huge<br/>repertoire written at that time and I&apos;m a participator in that. I<br/>remember being confident that the techniques that are needed to play<br/>polyrhythms accurately would eventually be part of any good<br/>professional musician&apos;s standard training.

I should imagine the web is filled with<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt; such comparisons - all waiting to prove me wrong! ;D<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;it&apos;s obvious that you&apos;ll always prefer the 12-equal versions,<br/>because<br/>&gt; &gt;your brain has been &quot;tuned&quot;, you might say, to the 12-equal<br/>pitches.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I should hope that&apos;s because they are /best/ tuned that way ;)</p><p>that would be kind of insulting and/or conceited to anyone that<br/>doesn&apos;t inhabit the sphere of modern Western musical culture,<br/>wouldn&apos;t it?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;and yes, wonderful things, such as the hammond organ, have been<br/>&gt; &gt;acheived by simply retuning the overtones to 12-equal. even 11-<br/>equal<br/>&gt; &gt;and 13-equal, which are extremely far from just intonation, have<br/>been<br/>&gt; &gt;made to sound &quot;smooth&quot;, by Bill Sethares and Jacky Ligon, among<br/>&gt; &gt;others -- by tuning the overtones, as well as fundamentals, to the<br/>&gt; &gt;equal tuning in question.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; If this is true, then /not/ tuning the overtones to 12-equal is<br/>what<br/>&gt; I really think half (or possibly all) the problem is - with the<br/>claim<br/>&gt; that 12-eT isn&apos;t perfect.<br/>&gt; About 11 and 13 equal.... ermm - I&apos;ll leave that argument for<br/>another<br/>&gt; day... ;D</p><p>well, it really part of the same argument. if just tuning has nothing<br/>to do with it, but eliminating clashing partials does have something<br/>to do with it, then you&apos;d have no basis for preferring a 12-equal<br/>tuning (of fundamentals _and_ overtones) to an 11-equal or 13-equal<br/>tuning (again, of fundamentals _and_ overtones).</p><p>&gt; &gt;on the other hand, as a musical being i *know* that all sorts of<br/>&gt; &gt;weird-ass scales can come to sound &quot;perfect&quot;, in the right musical<br/>&gt; &gt;contexts, and from that point of view the idea of one &quot;perfect&quot;<br/>&gt; &gt;musical scale is both absurd and very sad from the point of view of<br/>&gt; &gt;diminishing musical richness.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Not necessarily - music is based on &apos;limits&apos; all the time.<br/>&gt; There are so many possibilities in 12-eT unexplored.</p><p>even more in other tunings!</p><p>&gt; I would say<br/>&gt; music so far has really only begun to scratch the surface, as even<br/>in<br/>&gt; the best classical symphonies (for example), there are subtle<br/>&gt; chord &apos;mistakes&apos; and continuations in the melody/arrangement that<br/>&gt; could be improved further.<br/>&gt; Taking this to the extreme, theoretically, the best music would be<br/>&gt; tailored right down to the wave - and the individual 0.001<br/>&gt; second &apos;nuggets&apos; that ultimately make all music up.</p><p>right -- and clearly very few pieces created in such a way would<br/>conform to a 12-equal grid!</p><p>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt;B: Also, it could&apos;ve been that maybe the singer was (mistakingly)<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt;/aiming/ for chords which didn&apos;t beat rather than for what<br/>actually<br/>&gt; sounded<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt;best.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;What singers aim to, isn&apos;t what sound the best (to them at least)?<br/>&gt; &gt;Furthermore,<br/>&gt; &gt;I initially tought that the search of beatless sound was the key<br/>to a<br/>&gt; &gt;capella JI.<br/>&gt; &gt;Then I realised that for signing voices, the higher harmonics are<br/>&gt; &gt;relatively<br/>&gt; &gt;blunt (compared to fixed tuning instruments) for harmonics higher<br/>&gt; &gt;than, let say<br/>&gt; &gt;third or fourth. This is probably due to vibrato (even the<br/>slightest<br/>&gt; &gt;one) and/or<br/>&gt; &gt;the softness of vocal tract tissues. Whatever is the reason, this<br/>&gt; &gt;makes the beating of voices very difficult to detect directly and<br/>&gt; &gt;unlikely to be the primary clue to JI or not JI.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Interesting, but as faint as a singers&apos; harmonic overtones are, I<br/>&gt; would&apos;ve thought many (including the singers) could tell if their<br/>&gt; harmonic overtones are in &apos;tune&apos; with each other - even if on a<br/>&gt; subconscious level.</p><p>maybe, but daniel, you need to look beyond beating and study up on<br/>*combinational tones*. if you have helmholtz&apos;s book, you can read<br/>some about them there. otherwise, do some web searches. please?</p><p>&gt; I would love to hear human voices sing in harmony, but with the<br/>&gt; tones /and/ overtones tuned exactly to 12-equal :)</p><p>of course (i know you were joking but i&apos;ll go on) that&apos;s impossible,<br/>because any physical musical instrument that produces a periodic<br/>vibration (including the human voice, bowed strings, reeds, and brass<br/>instruments, when producing a clear tone) has, by virtue of fourier&apos;s<br/>theorem, a perfectly harmonic overtone spectrum.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; But possibly enough for the brain to (maybe subconsciously)<br/>recognise<br/>&gt; a certain &apos;off-tune&apos; sound when the sub-harmonics &apos;clash&apos; against<br/>the<br/>&gt; fundamentals/each other (&apos;roughness&apos;)...?</p><p>what &quot;sub-harmonics&quot; are you speaking of? virtual pitches?</p><p>&gt; As well as the previous &quot;overtones clashing with fundamentals&quot;<br/>&gt; or &quot;subtle quasi-mathematical &apos;wowowow&apos;&quot; syndromes, this could be<br/>&gt; explained by something else; Singing in Just intonation might be<br/>&gt; easier for the &apos;singing&apos; brain to cope with. However, to the final<br/>&gt; ear, 12-eT might ultimately sound better.</p><p>what if no one is listening but the singers? :)</p></div><h3><a id=39949 href="#39949">ðŸ”—</a>wallyesterpaulrus &#x3C;wallyesterpaulrus@yahoo.com&#x3E;</h3><span>10/23/2002 1:36:26 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In tuning@y..., &quot;Joseph Pehrson&quot; &lt;jpehrson@r...&gt; wrote:</p><p>&gt; Anyway, the entire interview is here:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; <a href="http://www.bruceduffie.com/blackwood.html">http://www.bruceduffie.com/blackwood.html</a></p><p>thanks so much for this joseph!! i was unaware of this interview.</p><p>here are some quotes that i find especially interesting:</p><p>&quot;I had discovered some chord progressions in 12 notes in the process<br/>of looking at some of the other equal tunings, which, oddly enough,<br/>were never exploited or used by composers between 1904 and 1915 when<br/>they would have been idiomatic.&quot;</p><p>this is right up my alley. i think i&apos;m going to *love* this music if<br/>i ever get to hear it. of course, joe monzo&apos;s latest bingo-card<br/>lattices of 12-equal would be the best way of visualizing these<br/>progressions, if we can ever find out what they are!</p><p>&quot;There is a faction of people who believe in the inevitability of the<br/>acceptance of the so-called academic modern idiom who are very<br/>annoyed at what I am doing.

Nothing more, nothing less. It provides high class<br/>entertainment to a relatively small audience of people who are tuned<br/>into it.&quot;</p><p>as far as i&apos;m concerned, blackwood has some BIG BALLS to come out and<br/>say this. go easley!! NB: see thing about &quot;subtlety&quot; below.</p><p>&quot;More likely the 5th Symphony, or the march in the 6th Symphony, or a<br/>piece like Respighi&apos;s Feste Romani, or a Beethoven 7th. Usually, it&apos;s<br/>a big splashy exciting piece, and they go on from there and work into<br/>the subtleties and get into the less bombastic things. They get into<br/>Brahms and Beethoven and Mozart. And then they find their way into<br/>chamber music.&quot;</p><p>personally, i was *really* interested in chamber music as a young<br/>kid, and only later grew to appreciate big splashy exciting pieces.</p><p>&quot;EB: It certainly is helpful. But after teaching harmony for 35<br/>years, I can hear the chord progressions. The other night, just for<br/>fun, I switched on the radio and heard the slow movement of the<br/>Jupiter Symphony of Mozart. I hadn&apos;t thought about the piece for<br/>awhile, but I found that as I listened to it, I could identify every<br/>chord as it went by. I could hear the piece go I, V of ii, V of v, V,<br/>V of iv, perfectly clear knowing what it was. At an earlier time I<br/>would&apos;ve been able to figure it out. But as it was, it went by and I<br/>heard it.&quot;</p><p>in this regard too, i think i developed in the opposite order -- i<br/>could identify chord progressions before i had much aptitude for<br/>melody or even rhythm!</p><p>&quot;Now perhaps, having this ability at this point has kind of changed<br/>my perspective on atonal music.&quot;</p><p>i guess it makes sense that someone like blackwood, who started out<br/>with perfect pitch, would have been drawn to atonal music for a time.<br/>but what of someone like me, with only *relative* pitch? could it be<br/>that the whole serial/atonal premise is even less aesthetically<br/>relavant for us &quot;relative&quot; underlings?</p><p>&quot;BD: You don&apos;t want to be obvious?</p><p>EB: I don&apos;t want to be obvious. I want subtleties to be there.</p><p>BD: Do you want to give obvious pleasure?</p><p>EB: Yes, I do, but I want there to be subtleties above and beyond<br/>that. If it gives obvious pleasure and there are no subtleties,<br/>you&apos;ve got a piece like Orff&apos;s &quot;Carmina Burana.&quot;</p><p>BD: That one just hits you in the gut.</p><p>EB: It hits you in the gut and you listen to it 5 times and that&apos;s<br/>the end.</p><p>BD: And yet, some people listen to it 500 times.</p><p>EB: I remember when I first heard it. I was absolutely swept off my<br/>feet. This must have been about 1958. I listened to it immediately<br/>again and then listened to it every day for four days and then that<br/>was the end of it. Never heard it again. Never wanted to hear it<br/>again.</p><p>BD: That was 35 years ago. Would you want to hear it again now?</p><p>EB: Oh sure. But it lost my attention at that time. There are no<br/>subtleties in it. &quot;</p><p>i know exactly what he means. in a way, that&apos;s why i like<br/>improvisation. there&apos;s no danger of playing exactly the same thing<br/>twice. unfortunately, i don&apos;t practice enough, or perhaps have enough<br/>natural talent, or am still too young and inexperienced, to really<br/>hit that transcendent subtlety more than say 15% of the time, but if<br/>i can simply entertain the other 85% of the time, that&apos;s good enough<br/>for me! . . .</p><p>maybe any more on this should go on &quot;metatuning&quot; . . .</p></div><h3><a id=39950 href="#39950">ðŸ”—</a>Joseph Pehrson &#x3C;jpehrson@rcn.com&#x3E;</h3><span>10/23/2002 1:43:08 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In tuning@y..., &quot;wallyesterpaulrus&quot; &lt;wallyesterpaulrus@y...&gt;</p><p><a href="/tuning/topicId_39089.html#39949">/tuning/topicId_39089.html#39949</a></p><p>wrote:<br/>&gt; --- In tuning@y..., &quot;Joseph Pehrson&quot; &lt;jpehrson@r...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; Anyway, the entire interview is here:<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; <a href="http://www.bruceduffie.com/blackwood.html">http://www.bruceduffie.com/blackwood.html</a><br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; thanks so much for this joseph!! i was unaware of this interview.<br/>&gt;</p><p>***You&apos;re welcome, Paul.

Or maybe all the 12-et  recordings we have should be electronically manipulated to have only<br/>12-et pitches in the ;-).</p><p>- the &quot;out of tune&quot; &apos;cello partials such as even the seventh partial can be louder than many of the accompanying<br/>instruments in a &apos;cello concerto - but you have to listen pretty carefully to hear them - maybe in sustained<br/>notes, because we tend to hear it as a single timbre rather than a multitude of separate instruments.</p><p>12-et as a fine tuning, indeed, and a vibrant one. Has a lot of energy in it - wakes one up!<br/>(Though it may possibly be somewhat of a twentieth century aquired taste, otherwise why didn&apos;t the<br/>musicians of Bach&apos;s time go for it when they could have easily retuned their harpsichords to match their<br/>lutes etc.).</p><p>My little &apos;cello drone midi clip exercise at<br/><a href="http://tunesmithy.netfirms.com/tunes/tunes.htm#Newbie_notes">http://tunesmithy.netfirms.com/tunes/tunes.htm#Newbie_notes</a><br/>may make a few think?

To myself, Just intervals grate - not 12- eT.<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt; Also, the oth=<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt; er possiblity could be thanks to point C in my previous reply.<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt; Interesting story btw.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;Since we were trying to convince you that 12-ET is not &quot;best&quot;, it<br/>is<br/>&gt; &gt;only necessary to establish that there is something &quot;better&quot;;<br/>whether<br/>&gt; &gt;this might be JI or another temperament is secondary. Since you<br/>have<br/>&gt; &gt;an objection to JI, I was trying to direct your attention to<br/>meantone<br/>&gt; &gt;temperament or 31-ET (its virtual equivalent), which I don&apos;t think<br/>&gt; &gt;anyone has ever described as harsh or grating (as long as you avoid<br/>&gt; &gt;the wolf).<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;The point that I was attempting to make is that, while I was very<br/>&gt; &gt;shocked when I again used 12-ET after several weeks of playing<br/>&gt; &gt;exclusively in meantone, I had a very delightful experience when I<br/>&gt; &gt;first played in meantone temperament after years of playing<br/>&gt; &gt;exclusively in 12-ET. Surely this must say that something other<br/>than<br/>&gt; &gt;a &quot;tolerance margin&quot; would be the primary consideration here.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Fair enough. Like you say, &apos;Tolerance&apos; would seem to have little or<br/>&gt; nothing to do with it. The only other possiblities then, might be<br/>&gt; something to do with some kind of timbre phenomenon (possibly<br/>&gt; specific to your keyboard)</p><p>I&apos;ve heard many different tunings over many years on two different<br/>retunable electronic organs I owned and also on two different kinds<br/>of Scalatrons and have used many sorts of timbres (all with harmonic<br/>partials) on them, and I think I can safely say that my impressions<br/>are pretty much the same, regardless of the timbre.</p><p>&gt; - or maybe the fact that your ears<br/>&gt; simply &apos;prefer&apos; mean-toned temperament.</p><p>My ears also prefer 19-ET, 22-ET, and 41-ET (to mention a few) over<br/>12-ET, and my preference is closely correlated with the ability of<br/>the tuning to approximate just intervals.  So I prefer 31 or 41-ET to<br/>19 or 22-ET.</p><p>You have to realize, however, that there are things you can do in 19<br/>or 22 that can&apos;t be done in other systems, and each one has its own<br/>combination of capabilities and limitation.  So the choice a composer<br/>may make is not necessarily only a matter of one system sounding<br/>harmonically &quot;better&quot; than another.  As we discussed below, there is<br/>also the melodic element to take into consideration.</p><p>&gt; Also, if the overtone<br/>&gt; harmonics of the instrument timbre was (unavoidably) strongly tuned<br/>&gt; towards JI, then this could make them clash with the fundamental<br/>&gt; tones or with each other.</p><p>The partials of most musical instruments are either exact or nearly<br/>exact multiples (or harmonics) of the fundamental frequency, so you<br/>have pointed out what happens when intervals are not in (or very<br/>close to) just intonation.  In 12-ET they clash much more strongly<br/>than they do in those other divisions I mentioned, and in just<br/>intonation the clashing (if you can even hear it) is minimal.</p><p>&gt; &gt;&gt; Maybe I&apos;m mistaken, but I think I recall someone in this group<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt; saying how for /melodic/ purposes, 12-eT is perfect, whilst<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt; harmonically it isn&apos;t perfect (well, he got one of those<br/>&gt; right ;)...<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;There is considerable evidence to suggest that raising the leading<br/>&gt; &gt;tone tends to improve the effect of its resolution to the tonic,<br/>both<br/>&gt; &gt;melodically *and* harmonically(!). (I wrote an article which was<br/>&gt; &gt;accepted for publication in the next issue of Xenharmonikon in<br/>which<br/>&gt; &gt;I elaborate on the effectiveness of a harmonically dissonant<br/>leading<br/>&gt; &gt;tone.)<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Interesting.</p><p>Just intonation doesn&apos;t preclude the possibility of making use of<br/>this effect, since, given enough tones, you could have more than one<br/>size of major third, for example, or you could have different sizes<br/>in different keys.  A different-size third would probably be<br/>considerably more dissonant than a just 4:5, but the objective would<br/>not be to avoid dissonance, but rather to maximize the total range of<br/>consonance to dissonance -- something that JI does better than any ET<br/>below 100 tones.</p><p>&gt; &gt;I was thinking of an experiment in which you were to *listen* to<br/>what<br/>&gt; &gt;you were *playing* so that you could try out as many different<br/>things<br/>&gt; &gt;as possible in the new tuning. (The problem with today&apos;s digital<br/>&gt; &gt;electronic instruments is that you have to have one that allows you<br/>&gt; &gt;to retune the notes individually.) But if you&apos;re only going to<br/>&gt; &gt;listen to something and not do the actual playing, then try to<br/>listen<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; It wouldn&apos;t be too easy to retune my keyboard (if at all possible),<br/>&gt; but I would assume it&apos;s better to concentrate just by listening -<br/>&gt; rather than playing aswell.</p><p>If you&apos;re playing, you can sustain any chord as long as you want, but<br/>if you&apos;re just listening to a recording, it may go by too fast for<br/>your purposes.  The best of both worlds would be to have someone else<br/>play while you listen.</p><p>&gt; &gt;to a number of things in the same tuning (I suggested meantone<br/>&gt; &gt;temperament) for a number of times over a period of a couple of<br/>weeks<br/>&gt; &gt;before you go back and listen to the *same thing(s)* (in the same<br/>&gt; &gt;timbres) in 12-ET.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I have done exactly this =) See below for details.</p><p>&gt; &gt; [Paul Erlich&apos;s recommendation:]<br/>&gt; &gt;<a href="http://bellsouthpwp.net/j/d/jdelaub/jstudio.htm">http://bellsouthpwp.net/j/d/jdelaub/jstudio.htm</a><br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; As I write this letter, I&apos;m listening to the examples presented on<br/>&gt; the page. In fact I&apos;ve been been doing this for the past couple of<br/>&gt; weeks - with as minimal &apos;exposure&apos; to 12-eT as possible (quite hard<br/>&gt; in this day and age one might find ;)<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; As expected, I found it off-tune at first, but I&apos;ll see if I can<br/>&gt; really get to prefer it. I somehow still suspect that I won&apos;t, but<br/>&gt; I&apos;m going to keep an open mind about this - since obviously many<br/>seem<br/>&gt; to think otherwise. I&apos;ll be posting the results here soon.</p><p>I see that this is adaptive JI, which may or may not sound a little<br/>too dry (i.e., beatless) for your taste.  It would be good also to<br/>find something in both 12-ET and meantone temperament as well, after<br/>you&apos;ve spent sufficient time with this.</p><p>Doesn&apos;t anyone out there have any music more than a few seconds in<br/>length in both 12-ET and meantone temperament in exactly the same<br/>timbre?</p><p>--George</p></div><h3><a id=40005 href="#40005">ðŸ”—</a>wallyesterpaulrus &#x3C;wallyesterpaulrus@yahoo.com&#x3E;</h3><span>10/24/2002 11:27:43 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In tuning@y..., &quot;Gene Ward Smith&quot; &lt;genewardsmith@j...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt; --- In tuning@y..., prophecyspirit@a... wrote:<br/>&gt; &gt; In a message dated 10/23/02 2:14:34 PM Central Daylight Time,<br/>&gt; &gt; soundburst@l... writes:<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; Yet another multi-post about the view that only the 12-equal<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; temperament is needed for all the best music.<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; The best argument agaisnt 12-ET, or any other kind of ET, is such<br/>scales are<br/>&gt; &gt; out of tune with the harmonic partials the notes in the intervals<br/>used are<br/>&gt; &gt; made of.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I thought you maintained, reasonably enough, that being out of tune<br/>&gt;by a cent or two did not really count as &quot;out of tune&quot;.</p><p>and also (if i might chime in, pauline), again quite reasonably, that<br/>combinational tones are of great importance here.</p></div><h3><a id=40013 href="#40013">ðŸ”—</a>wallyesterpaulrus &#x3C;wallyesterpaulrus@yahoo.com&#x3E;</h3><span>10/24/2002 11:46:46 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In tuning@y..., &quot;gdsecor&quot; &lt;gdsecor@y...&gt; wrote:</p><p>&gt;  but the objective would<br/>&gt; not be to avoid dissonance, but rather to maximize the total range<br/>of<br/>&gt; consonance to dissonance -- something that JI does better than any<br/>ET<br/>&gt; below 100 tones.</p><p>i am curious as to how you arrived at that figure. reply on tuning-<br/>math if appropriate.</p><p>&gt; Doesn&apos;t anyone out there have any music more than a few seconds in<br/>&gt; length in both 12-ET and meantone temperament in exactly the same<br/>&gt; timbre?</p><p>of course -- herman miller, on both his pavane for a warped princess<br/>page, and pachelbel&apos;s warped canon page, provides versions in 12-<br/>equal and many other tunings, including several varieties of meantone.</p></div><h3><a id=40030 href="#40030">ðŸ”—</a>Gene Ward Smith &#x3C;genewardsmith@juno.com&#x3E;</h3><span>10/24/2002 1:09:35 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In tuning@y..., &quot;gdsecor&quot; &lt;gdsecor@y...&gt; wrote:</p><p>&gt; Doesn&apos;t anyone out there have any music more than a few seconds in<br/>&gt; length in both 12-ET and meantone temperament in exactly the same<br/>&gt; timbre?</p><p>If not, I can easily create some examples.

You can start with a modest number of tones at such and<br/>such a prime limit, and if you want to increase your capabilities<br/>later, you can just add more tones.  If you don&apos;t increase the prime<br/>limit, then you get more modulation, but if you do, then you get more<br/>kinds of harmonic material (or you can do both).  Having done this,<br/>whatever JI instruments you have built are compatible with whatever<br/>new ones you might build, since they have a subset of tones from the<br/>new (larger) set.</p><p>Contrast this with someone who has started with 19-ET (for example)<br/>and decides later to use a different ET.  Unless a specially built<br/>instrument is retunable (or otherwise adaptable), it is necessary to<br/>build a new instrument for the new system.  An exception is going to<br/>72-ET from one of its subsets (including 12), but I wouldn&apos;t be as<br/>happy with this as I would be with a JI subset.</p><p>Some Middle Path tunings also have the advantage of compatible<br/>expandability.  A good example is the Miracle tuning: if you start<br/>with Blackjack, you have the option of going on to Canasta and Stud-<br/>Loco later on.</p><p>But with JI your options are much less limited.</p><p>--George</p></div><h3><a id=40333 href="#40333">ðŸ”—</a>prophecyspirit@aol.com</h3><span>10/29/2002 8:36:49 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>In a message dated 10/29/02 9:47:59 AM Central Standard Time,<br/><a href="mailto:gdsecor@yahoo.com">gdsecor@yahoo.com</a> writes:</p><p>&gt; One of the strengths of JI is that it&apos;s an open or &quot;expandable&quot;<br/>&gt; approach.

For all those not in the know, I&apos;m firmly of the opinion<br/>that only 12-tET (as opposed to JI or meantone) is needed for all the<br/>best music...</p><p>---------------------</p><p>Hi J. Pehrson,</p><p>&gt;I can see we&apos;re back to &quot;White Bread&quot; 12-tET again with you! :)</p><p>lol :)</p><p>&gt;&gt; Not necessarily - music is based on &apos;limits&apos; all the time.<br/>&gt;&gt; There are so many possibilities in 12-eT unexplored. I would say<br/>&gt;&gt; music so far has really only begun to scratch the surface, as even<br/>in<br/>&gt;&gt; the best classical symphonies (for example), there are subtle<br/>&gt;&gt; chord &apos;mistakes&apos; and continuations in the melody/arrangement that<br/>&gt;&gt; could be improved further.<br/>&gt;&gt; Taking this to the extreme, theoretically, the best music would be<br/>&gt;&gt; tailored right down to the wave - and the individual 0.001<br/>&gt;&gt; second &apos;nuggets&apos; that ultimately make all music up.</p><p>&gt;***I think, Daniel, you may be a bit optimistic about this. Many<br/>&gt;people don&apos;t share this view. In fact, I was just reading an</p><p>&gt;&quot;BD: Is there any end to musical possibility?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;EB: Oh, eventually there is, but we&apos;re not there yet. At this point,<br/>&gt;I am persuaded that the tonal and harmonic resources of the 12 note<br/>&gt;equal scale have, in fact, been discovered and exploited. And I think</p><p>I disagree. Consider how many different melodies there can be. The<br/>thing I&apos;ve noticed is even if certain chord patterns are similar, if<br/>the timing and the contrapuntal melodies are in any way different,<br/>this really makes it a whole new tune.</p><p>I&apos;ve noticed that the same chord progression can have many<br/>different &apos;flavours&apos; according to not only what chords came<br/>before/after, but also in the implementation. Yes, there is a<br/>fundamental limit to how many melodies can be composed, but combined<br/>with the timbre (timbric?) and rhythmic permutations, this number is<br/>getting so ridiculously high, that for all intents and purposes it<br/>might as well be infinite :)<br/>I think also what makes people say 12-equal has been exhausted is the<br/>fact that there&apos;s so little good music around these days anyway, so<br/>the temptation is great...</p><p>------------</p><p>Hi wallyesterpaulrus,</p><p>&gt; Due to<br/>&gt; the complex mathematical interactions on air,<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;what in particular are you thinking of here?</p><p>Well, I simply meant the inner design of instruments - and how they<br/>affect the air to produce a certain timbre.</p><p>&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; In the mean time, do you know of a comparison anywhere on the<br/>web<br/>&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; which demonstrates a good (say... classical) tune with examples<br/>of<br/>&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; 12-eT vs Just tuning? I should imagine the web is filled with<br/>&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; such comparisons - all waiting to prove me wrong! ;D<br/>&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt;&gt; &gt;it&apos;s obvious that you&apos;ll always prefer the 12-equal versions,<br/>because<br/>&gt;&gt; &gt;your brain has been &quot;tuned&quot;, you might say, to the 12-equal<br/>pitches.<br/>&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt; I should hope that&apos;s because they are /best/ tuned that way ;)</p><p>&gt;that would be kind of insulting and/or conceited to anyone that<br/>&gt;doesn&apos;t inhabit the sphere of modern Western musical culture,<br/>&gt;wouldn&apos;t it?</p><p>It&apos;s my opinion, and one I think might actually be ultimately correct<br/>for many reasons. Remember, I think that I could be wrong too. I&apos;m<br/>not saying for certain that I&apos;m absolutely right :)</p><p>&gt;&gt; If this is true, then /not/ tuning the overtones to 12-equal is<br/>&gt;&gt; what<br/>&gt;&gt; I really think half (or possibly all) the problem is - with the<br/>&gt;&gt; claim<br/>&gt;&gt; that 12-eT isn&apos;t perfect.<br/>&gt;&gt; About 11 and 13 equal.... ermm - I&apos;ll leave that argument for<br/>&gt;&gt; another day... ;D</p><p>&gt;well, it really part of the same argument. if just tuning has nothing<br/>&gt;to do with it, but eliminating clashing partials does have something<br/>&gt;to do with it, then you&apos;d have no basis for preferring a 12- equal<br/>&gt;tuning (of fundamentals _and_ overtones) to an 11-equal or 13- equal<br/>&gt;tuning (again, of fundamentals _and_ overtones).</p><p>I&apos;m not sure I quite follow here, but basically I think the number 12<br/>is very special for some reason. I can&apos;t see any contradiction in<br/>eliminating clashing partials and keeping only to 12-equal.<br/>I doubt any amount of cultural conditioning could convince people 11<br/>or 13 equal is better than 12 equal even if everyone started out<br/>using 11 or 13 equal in the first place.</p><p>&gt;&gt; Not necessarily - music is based on &apos;limits&apos; all the time.<br/>&gt;&gt; There are so many possibilities in 12-eT unexplored.</p><p>&gt;even more in other tunings!</p><p>Yes, but I meant /good/ possibilities ;-)</p><p>&gt;&gt; Taking this to the extreme, theoretically, the best music would be<br/>&gt;&gt; tailored right down to the wave - and the individual 0.001<br/>&gt;&gt; second &apos;nuggets&apos; that ultimately make all music up.</p><p>&gt;right -- and clearly very few pieces created in such a way would<br/>&gt;conform to a 12-equal grid!</p><p>Yes, but only in the same way that there are about 100,000 possible<br/>bad melodies to every good one :D</p><p>&gt;&gt; Interesting, but as faint as a singers&apos; harmonic overtones are, I<br/>&gt;&gt; would&apos;ve thought many (including the singers) could tell if their<br/>&gt;&gt; harmonic overtones are in &apos;tune&apos; with each other - even if on a<br/>&gt;&gt; subconscious level.</p><p>&gt;maybe, but daniel, you need to look beyond beating and study up on<br/>&gt;*combinational tones*. if you have helmholtz&apos;s book, you can read<br/>&gt;some about them there. otherwise, do some web searches. please?</p><p>I tried, but didn&apos;t find too much. I think I possibly understand<br/>without realising it anyway, but if you could concisely explain it in<br/>a paragraph or two, I would be grateful :)</p><p>&gt;&gt; I would love to hear human voices sing in harmony, but with the<br/>&gt;&gt; tones /and/ overtones tuned exactly to 12-equal :)</p><p>&gt;of course (i know you were joking but i&apos;ll go on) that&apos;s impossible,<br/>&gt;because any physical musical instrument that produces a periodic<br/>&gt;vibration (including the human voice, bowed strings, reeds, and brass<br/>&gt;instruments, when producing a clear tone) has, by virtue of fourier&apos;s<br/>&gt;theorem, a perfectly harmonic overtone spectrum.</p><p>Which is why only a synthesizer could produce the aforementioned<br/>overtones - yep.</p><p>&gt;&gt; But possibly enough for the brain to (maybe subconsciously)<br/>recognise<br/>&gt;&gt; a certain &apos;off-tune&apos; sound when the sub-harmonics &apos;clash&apos; against<br/>the<br/>&gt;&gt; fundamentals/each other (&apos;roughness&apos;)...?</p><p>&gt;what &quot;sub-harmonics&quot; are you speaking of? virtual pitches?</p><p>Umm... just replace &apos;sub-harmonics&apos; with &apos;overtones&apos;. I didn&apos;t need<br/>to add another term.</p><p>&gt;&gt; As well as the previous &quot;overtones clashing with fundamentals&quot;<br/>&gt;&gt; or &quot;subtle quasi-mathematical &apos;wowowow&apos;&quot; syndromes, this could be<br/>&gt;&gt; explained by something else; Singing in Just intonation might be<br/>&gt;&gt; easier for the &apos;singing&apos; brain to cope with. However, to the final<br/>&gt;&gt; ear, 12-eT might ultimately sound better.</p><p>&gt;what if no one is listening but the singers? :)</p><p>lol :)<br/>Umm.. one other thought is that maybe the effect with singers is that<br/>singing in JI will increase some physical vibration near their<br/>ear/brain - and that this is a good &apos;feeling&apos; (similar to how a<br/>computer&apos;s case will &apos;buzz&apos; if the cooling fan inside is spinning at<br/>a certain frequency, or the phenomenon of how shorter buildings can<br/>topple more easily than taller buildings in a hurricane - if the<br/>frequency is adjusted to that building).<br/>A singer might be biased to &apos;look&apos; for this frequency instead of the<br/>(in my opinion) natural 12-equal pitch.<br/>In this sense, I would argue that it&apos;s the listener&apos;s ears which are<br/>more accurate.</p><p>-------------</p><p>Hi Pauline,</p><p>&gt;The best argument agaisnt 12-ET, or any other kind<br/>&gt;of ET, is such scales are out of tune with the<br/>&gt;harmonic partials the notes in the intervals used<br/>&gt;are made of.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;In 12-ET E 400 is 14 cents large out of tune with the<br/>&gt;5th partial E 386.314. The two pitches in any octave<br/>&gt;beat strongly with each other!</p><p>I think you must have missed my earlier point how if the partials are<br/>also tuned to 12-et, then one can have the best of both worlds :)<br/>Also remember that the &apos;evolving&apos; type sound you get when combining<br/>JI partials with 12-equal intervals might be preferred, but this<br/>isn&apos;t anything to do with the Just ratios in particular; it could be<br/>any &apos;offset&apos; from the original 12-eT that would create this<br/>evolving &apos;chorus&apos; (roughness?) effect.<br/>Example: 400 cents played together with 414 cents would create<br/>aformentioned chorus effect, just like 400 cents and 386.314 cents<br/>does (or 393c and 407c for that matter).</p><p>------------</p><p>Hi Robert,</p><p>&gt;&gt; In 12-ET E 400 is 14 cents large out of tune with the 5th partial<br/>E 386.314.<br/>&gt;&gt; The two pitches in any octave<br/>&gt;&gt; beat strongly with each other!</p><p>&gt;Yes, and if you say that 12-et is the only true tuning, as some do,<br/>it means<br/>&gt;that the partials of say a &apos;cello<br/>&gt;in a &apos;cello concerto are out of tune, and the instrument should be<br/>rebuilt<br/>&gt;somehow to have a timbre with 12-et<br/>&gt;partials - surely! Or maybe all the 12-et recordings we have should<br/>be<br/>&gt;electronically manipulated to have only 12-et pitches in the ;-).</p><p>Yes! I concur! :D</p><p>&gt;12-et as a fine tuning, indeed, and a vibrant one. Has a lot of<br/>energy in it -<br/>&gt;wakes one up!<br/>&gt;(Though it may possibly be somewhat of a twentieth century aquired<br/>taste,<br/>&gt;otherwise why didn&apos;t the<br/>&gt;musicians of Bach&apos;s time go for it when they could have easily<br/>retuned their<br/>&gt;harpsichords to match their lutes etc.).</p><p>Good question and one I am tempted to explore the background of to<br/>find out more.</p><p>&gt;My little &apos;cello drone midi clip exercise at<br/>&gt;<a href="http://tunesmithy.netfirms.com/tunes/tunes.htm#Newbie_notes">http://tunesmithy.netfirms.com/tunes/tunes.htm#Newbie_notes</a><br/>&gt;may make a few think?

The just passages</p><p>This could be a timbre phenomenon maybe? Is there any way you prefer<br/>it in 12 equal, or is JI/MT better in every way?</p><p>&gt;But there are people who very much dislike the sound of music<br/>&gt;in just intonation, and for those people, just intonation, even<br/>&gt;thought it sounds different, doesn&apos;t have much to offer. But there<br/>&gt;are others of us - over 25% at least - who contrariwise like the<br/>&gt;sound of the just versions better, finding their emotional impact<br/>&gt;to be more pleasing and intense. Should we be left out?</p><p>Ummm... no I guess not :) Maybe you 25% lot are right and I&apos;m wrong,<br/>but I&apos;m wondering if there&apos;s the /chance/ that the 75% (including me<br/>it would seem!) are right :)<br/>At this point in time, I won&apos;t bother arguing about the possiblity<br/>that we&apos;re both right in different ways.<br/>Obviously, even if the 75% are right, it would make sense to<br/>(sometimes) have music performed in Just/Mean-tone for the benefit of<br/>those who prefer it that way - even if they are wrong to prefer it<br/>that way ;)</p><p>&gt;There will always be people who initially react strongly against<br/>&gt;something which clashes with what they are used to hearing - the fact<br/>&gt;that it sounds &quot;different&quot; becomes psychologically equivalent to<br/>&gt;sounding &quot;off&quot; or &quot;funny&quot; or just &quot;wrong&quot; to them.</p><p>It doesn&apos;t just sound different to me - it really does sound off. And<br/>it&apos;s not just initially, I&apos;ve really tried to get used to Just/Mean-<br/>tone - for longer lengths of time that most people would dream of! :)</p><p>------------</p><p>Hi Ed Foote,</p><p>&gt;12 ET may wake one up, at first, but there is an inuring effect that<br/>&gt;comes with it. Ultimately, it begins to dull the senses at a<br/>particularly<br/>&gt;organic level. Et can desensitize the nervous system in a sadly<br/>insidious<br/>&gt;way.<br/>&gt;When all like intervals are the same tempered size, the ear begins to<br/>&gt;accept the dissonance as the standard harmonic quality, and stops<br/>listening<br/>&gt;for the textural sensations that comes from juxtaposing tempered vs.<br/>Just<br/>&gt;intervals. (We may liken this to weather. After a few weeks of<br/>perfect 70</p><p>Very interesting if you&apos;re actually right, but of course I completely<br/>disagree. If you were right, then agreed - it would be very sad how<br/>so many people are &apos;brainwashed&apos; by 12-eT. But going by experience,<br/>it would seem brainwashing has little to do with it. It would seem<br/>different minds are simply geared (whether rightly or wrongly) to JI<br/>or 12-eT.<br/>I would be very interested to know - Do any people in this group like<br/>Just intonation and 12-equal equally as much?</p><p>&gt;degree, sunny weather in the South Pacific islands, I began to wish<br/>for the<br/>&gt;excitement of a passing thunderstorm.

Well,<br/>you&apos;re a good &quot;foil&quot; so no harm in that!</p><p>Actually, some of your arguments seem to &quot;hold water...&quot;  For<br/>instance, you&apos;re viewpoint that it *still* is possible to write music<br/>in 12-equal, I believe is confirmed by certain fine composers around<br/>still doing it, although they *do* tend to use *lots* of &quot;special<br/>effects&quot; in the categories of variations of timbre and so forth, or<br/>in novel use of metrics, timing or instrumentation.  Mostly, I<br/>believe these &quot;special effects&quot; are used to offset the 12-equal<br/>scale, which has been so thoroughly explored...</p><p>There is nothing all that magical about the number 12, despite its<br/>being an unusually harmonic and versatile scale with a limited number<br/>of pitches, but if I understand my history correctly, we might just<br/>as easily chosen a 19-equal scale, as emulating a fair number of<br/>harmonic series partials, without too many more notes.</p><p>I understand that you believe emulating partials is not all that<br/>important a process, but I believe you would have to explain why our<br/>*Western* music spent all its time in the Renaissance using parallel<br/>octaves and fifths (2nd and 3rd partials) and then spent so much time<br/>evolving meantone systems that would handle the 5th partial as a new<br/>practice, starting with &quot;Faux Bourdon&quot; in England and so on...</p><p>So, history seems to show that the pursuit of these partials had a<br/>*lot* to do with what we have, over a period of time,<br/>called &quot;music...&quot; much of which involves the lower integer ones, and<br/>which led, ironically looking at *your* viewpoint, to 12-equal, which<br/>does a remarkable job of emulating them.  I think it&apos;s pretty clear<br/>that this search for the emulation of partials lead both to<br/>*meantone* and to your favorite 12-equal.</p><p>I believe Paul&apos;s point, if I have it correct, is that the significant<br/>beating in 12-equal means it really *is* an imperfect system for<br/>emulating partials, although certainly not on the scale of the<br/>dissonant 13-equal...  Which is, of course, a usable scale, just much<br/>different...</p><p>So essentially, you&apos;ve put the &quot;cart before the horse&quot; or put your<br/>accustomization to 12-equal before the history that selected it!  In<br/>a sense 12-equal is a splendid *compromise* that has worked well for<br/>a long time, but not as long as the *meantone* tuning that preceded<br/>it...  I&apos;m sure that if you lived in the &quot;heyday&quot; of meantone you<br/>would have proclaimed that the &quot;only way&quot; as well...  :)</p><p>Since you&apos;re working *backwards* at least in *my* thinking, the idea<br/>of taking the natural overtone series and creating 12-equal partials<br/>seems particularly curious.  It&apos;s even more curious when we think<br/>about the fact that even a single *musical* tone, or what we commonly<br/>define as music, with a recognizable pitch, is distinguised<br/>from &quot;noise&quot; just by the recurring periodic nature of it&apos;s<br/>simultaneous just overtones...</p><p>I rather wish somebody would do your experiment with 12-equal partial<br/>timbres, since, personally, I believe the results would sound pretty<br/>terrible and would set to rest the notion that we should, somehow, go<br/>in *that* direction, rather than the other way:  trying to create<br/>systems that emulate the harmonic series as much as possible which I<br/>think we can *conclusively* state is what Western history has been<br/>trying to do...</p><p>Joseph Pehrson</p></div><h3><a id=41518 href="#41518">ðŸ”—</a>francois_laferriere &#x3C;francois.laferriere@oxymel.com&#x3E; &#x3C;francois.laferriere@oxymel.com&#x3E;</h3><span>12/17/2002 8:21:45 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>hello Daniel</p><p>&gt; I think you must have missed my earlier point how if the partials<br/>are<br/>&gt; also tuned to 12-et, then one can have the best of both worlds :)</p><p>On acoustical instrument, &quot;tuning the partials&quot; makes no sense at all.<br/>An instrument is<br/>either (nearly) harmonic (most of them) or (downright) inharmonic<br/>according to the laws of physics that<br/>governs its vibration modes.</p><p>With electronic instrument, it is possible, in principle, to &quot;tune<br/>partials&quot;.

What one appreciates in each language is all<br/>the different tones and forms of expression. Even the subtleties in<br/>the pronounciation of words are obviously more than just trivial. My<br/>point rests again - music is a universal language - and this is why<br/>people can appreciate &apos;different&apos; music from the other side of the<br/>globe. This doesn&apos;t mean there isn&apos;t an ideal or incentive to aim for<br/>though. Of course, there is /great/ room for variety and creativity,<br/>but I ultimately believe there&apos;s a reason why a certain piece of<br/>music is good - and that this completely transcends culture and could<br/>even be mathematical and/or spiritual.</p><p>&gt;This is a real-world parallel to what you are asking anyone to<br/>believe: that<br/>&gt;every piece of music would be best in &apos;one language&apos;.

This isn&apos;t always the case<br/>though since certain &apos;tune nuggets&apos; (for example) and chord sequences<br/>are recognised as being better than others. It all depends on the<br/>context of the tune - and is a million times more complex than anyone<br/>one of us could imagine.<br/>It just so happens that I believe 12-eT is one of the main &apos;common<br/>denominators&apos; around which all music should be built.</p><p>&gt;You owe it to yourself to consider your question again, in two<br/>parallel but<br/>&gt;equally important ways:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;1.

Completely wrong. You&apos;re really showing how little you know about the musics of the world, and the reactions of people from differing cultures to other &apos;musics&apos;. Sound might be universal, aspects of rhythm certainly, even certain fundamental tuning and scalar &apos;melodicles&apos; (pentatonic melodies abound over the world, etc.). But &apos;music&apos;, as you are portraying it (a &quot;tune&quot;, chord progressions, etc) is not universal.

How can an art form meet some overall value of &quot;good&quot;?

Nevertheless I read his<br/>original<br/>article on the web (&quot;relating tuning and timbre&quot;). To say the truth, I<br/>overlooked<br/>the section &quot;from scale to timbre&quot;.</p><p>&gt; Paul<br/>&gt; that all depends on the amplitude envelope(s) involved. if you start<br/>&gt; with a synthesized timbre that sounds like a single note, and retune<br/>&gt; the partials as above, in all likelihood the result will still sound<br/>&gt; like a single note, just a bit &quot;noisier&quot; or &quot;wobblier&quot;. if you don&apos;t<br/>&gt; believe me, you absolutely must obtain a copy of bill sethares&apos; book<br/>&gt; and CD.</p><p>I do believe you, I won&apos;t challenge your hands-on experience of such<br/>timbre.<br/>I suppose that it is not sufficiently deviant from harmonic sound to<br/>fall out of the cognitive category &quot;harmonic sounds&quot;; no surprise it<br/>may<br/>be perceived as slighly weird single note.</p><p>Is there really a &quot;wobble&quot; perceived ?? If so this may means that<br/>there is a totally virtual beat between a pseudo-harmonics and a<br/>&quot;virtual&quot; harmonics placed where there would have been an harmonics.<br/>This is really facinating!</p><p>&gt; Francois:<br/>&gt; Further, this argument cannot be used to advocate 12ET because this<br/>&gt; can be done (or at least imagined) for ANY tuning.</p><p>&gt; Paul:<br/>&gt; exactly -- though the further the partials are moved from a harmonic<br/>&gt; series, the less realistic and more wobbly/noisy the timbre becomes.<br/>&gt; 12-equal (including the 7th harmonic) is not too bad at all in this<br/>&gt; respect.</p><p>It is pleasure to know that we agree from time to time</p><p>&gt; Fran&ccedil;ois:<br/>&gt; Furthermore, having a set of inharmonic tones that<br/>&gt; never beat or produce any kind of roughness when combined would<br/>probably be boring<br/>&gt; to death...</p><p>Paul:<br/>&gt; this is far from true for what daniel is proposing. all the<br/>&gt; traditional dissonances of 12-equal are still dissonant in this<br/>&gt; arrangement!</p><p>Again, I do not challenge your auditory experience that is far greater<br/>than mine. I suppose that traditionnal dissonaces still exists because<br/>the retuned timbre are not that far from being harmonic. What I mean<br/>is that, no combination of tone produces beating pseudo-harmonics<br/>because all pseudo-harmonics are arbitrarily tuned to perfecly<br/>overlaps. So if there is any roughness, it is contained in<br/>individual tone, and not much by combination of tones.</p><p>It is like if every single note contained the whole set of interval of<br/>the 12ET scale.<br/>For me it is like putting all the spices you have in every ingredient<br/>to be used in any recipies.

Thus<br/>&gt; you propose instead of having partials to<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; f0<br/>&gt; 2*f0<br/>&gt; 3*f0<br/>&gt; 4*f0<br/>&gt; 5*f0<br/>&gt; 6*f0<br/>&gt; 7*f0<br/>&gt; 8*f0<br/>&gt; 9*f0<br/>&gt; 10*f0<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; have them &quot;tuned&quot; to<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; f0<br/>&gt; f0 * 2<br/>&gt; f0 * 2^(19/12)<br/>&gt; f0 * 4<br/>&gt; f0 * 2^(14/6)<br/>&gt; f0 * 2^(31/12)<br/>&gt; - (being ambiguous in 12ET, 7th harmonics does not deserves to<br/>exist)<br/>&gt; f0 * 8<br/>&gt; etc.</p><p>Absolutely, but I think it can go one further than this. Imagine that<br/>for every note played in a tune, the harmonic partials are tailored<br/>for that moment in the instrument. This means the timbre of an<br/>instrument would evolve throughout the tune according to what chords<br/>are playing at the time. This would be incredibly unfeasible and<br/>impractical, but maybe the best music would actually do this - who<br/>knows! :)</p><p>&gt; for ANY tuning. Furthermore, having a set of inharmonic tones that<br/>&gt; never beat or<br/>&gt; produce any kind of roughness when combined would probably be boring<br/>&gt; to death...</p><p>Not if also combined with clever use of vibrato, slides and other<br/>slight pitch offsets I would imagine.</p><p>&gt; If the singers are not qualified to sing &quot;correctly&quot; because singing<br/>&gt; is a biased processed, then should we not exclude song voice from<br/>&gt; the realm of &quot;correct music&quot;!! Come on!! that is a very specious<br/>&gt; argument (to say the less)!</p><p>Well obviously, singing is good and fun for many reasons.

Why,<br/>&gt;otherwise, would he be bothering with this list??</p><p>Absolutely. I know I will get a more informed response here than<br/>almost any other place. In the beginning, I was looking for a general<br/>Yahoo group on music/scale theory, couldn&apos;t find one (at least not a<br/>very active one), and found the tuning group.</p><p>As for composing microtonally, well it&apos;s certainly not totally out of<br/>the question. If by any chance I do get to like microtonal music (and<br/>I will listen to more from the tuning punks site - I promise), then<br/>I&apos;ll certainly give it a shot. A few have suggested that I try to<br/>compose music from the off in microtonal (choosing the scale first,<br/>then playing around). When I get some more free time, I will consider<br/>this too.</p><p>To be honset, I know I&apos;ve been advocating 12-eT, but I think there<br/>might even be a chance that Pythagoras&apos; scale of fifths could even be<br/>the &apos;right&apos; scale too - since many of the pitches come close to Just<br/>intonation such as Fb and 5/4 (which I don&apos;t agree with, but I could<br/>be wrong on this). This way there would be (almost) JI pitches mixed<br/>in with (almost) the 12-eT pitches.</p><p>As far as my points on harmonic partials go, does anyone have any<br/>comments about the partials in an instrument changing dynamically to<br/>fit the various chords throughout a tune? For example a very &apos;high<br/>partial&apos; (say... the 7th partial Bb, could be changed to B or A if<br/>the background chord demanded it). It goes without saying a<br/>synthesizer would be needed for this.</p><p>I&apos;ll add a couple more things. One thing I&apos;ve noticed is how the<br/>overall pitch of the partials are &apos;quieter&apos; when the partials used<br/>are Just (*1, *2, *3, *4, *5 etc). Naturally, this is because<br/>of &apos;destructive interference&apos; of the partials colliding upon each<br/>other throughout the wave. I would be interested to know the relative<br/>volumes of these - or are they are all quietened down equally?</p><p>Regards,<br/>Daniel (<a href="mailto:soundburst@lycos.com">soundburst@lycos.com</a>)</p></div><h3><a id=41563 href="#41563">ðŸ”—</a>Joseph Pehrson &#x3C;jpehrson@rcn.com&#x3E; &#x3C;jpehrson@rcn.com&#x3E;</h3><span>12/19/2002 7:27:58 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;Daniel White &lt;soundburst@l...&gt;&quot;</p><p><a href="/tuning/topicId_39089.html#41562">/tuning/topicId_39089.html#41562</a></p><p>&gt;<br/>&gt; Absolutely.

Completely wrong. You&apos;re really showing how little you know<br/>about the<br/>&gt;musics of the world, and the reactions of people from differing<br/>cultures to<br/>&gt;other &apos;musics&apos;. Sound might be universal, aspects of rhythm<br/>certainly, even<br/>&gt;certain fundamental tuning and scalar &apos;melodicles&apos; (pentatonic<br/>melodies abound<br/>&gt;over the world, etc.). But &apos;music&apos;, as you are portraying it<br/>(a &quot;tune&quot;, chord<br/>&gt;progressions, etc) is not universal. And certainly 12tet isn&apos;t, and<br/>I hope it<br/>&gt;never becomes such.</p><p>(This is getting pretty far from tuning I guess, so I won&apos;t say much<br/>more on the subject...)</p><p>But surely you think some chord combinations are better than others -<br/>even outside of opinion? I&apos;m not talking about ones which are<br/>arguable - for no-one really knows for sure about those. But compare<br/>a completely random/clashing chord sequence (say... made by a<br/>computer with a randomised program),... with one that has been<br/>constructed by a human composer thoughtfully. There&apos;s no doubt the<br/>composer&apos;s sequence is better. Thus if one chord can be better than<br/>another, then all chord sequences can have a &apos;quality rating&apos;.<br/>Wouldn&apos;t you agree?</p><p>Glad you think that certain aspects of rhythm and &apos;melodicles&apos; might<br/>be universal.</p><p>&gt;Ever wonder if composers, feeling trapped by the huge distance of<br/>100 cents<br/>&gt;between intervals, longed for a more natural way to set speech, so<br/>that a<br/>&gt;&apos;song&apos; more closely paralleled the lovely intonations of the actual<br/>language?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; (Note: I know at least one very important composer who has...)</p><p>Good point, and that&apos;s exactly why I think slides are fine in music -<br/>as it&apos;s more of an &apos;effect&apos;.</p><p>&gt;&gt; but I ultimately believe there&apos;s a reason why a certain piece of<br/>&gt;&gt; music is good</p><p>&gt;Good? How can an art form meet some overall value of &quot;good&quot;?</p><p>Try loading a windows exe program file as a raw sample into a sound<br/>editor such as Sound Forge. Then listen to one Mozart&apos;s Symphony<br/>No.40. There can be no doubt the symphony is the better piece of<br/>music in every way - even outside of opinion. Thus all music can be<br/>rated... surely?</p><p>&gt; (Gad, we&apos;re getting pretty far from tuning...)</p><p>Hehe - yeah I guess so, but it is interesting :)</p><p>&gt;&gt; Mozart is of course a<br/>&gt;&gt; brilliant composer, but that doesn&apos;t mean he&apos;s going to be right<br/>&gt;&gt; about /every/ choice in music. And why should this include the<br/>&gt;&gt; temperament he chose for his own music?</p><p>&gt;Because it&apos;s HIS creation. It is absurd and arrogant to assume you<br/>would know<br/>&gt;better about his choices</p><p>I&apos;m not saying I do know better for sure - just there&apos;s a /chance/<br/>that he may be wrong. Also, as someone else has already said,<br/>meantone temperament was generally more prevalent around the time, so<br/>this isn&apos;t so much a deliberate mistake anyway - more just following<br/>what was &apos;ready at hand&apos;.</p><p>Cheers,<br/>Daniel (<a href="mailto:soundburst@lycos.com">soundburst@lycos.com</a>)</p></div><h3><a id=41575 href="#41575">ðŸ”—</a>Daniel White &#x3C;soundburst@lycos.com&#x3E; &#x3C;soundburst@lycos.com&#x3E;</h3><span>12/20/2002 11:38:00 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Hi Monz,</p><p>&gt;i used to read MTO-talk, but gave up a long time ago, mostly<br/>&gt;because i found it both dull *and* stuffy! :)<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;(... especially compared to these lists, as you point out, Joe.</p><p>This is another reason why I like to post on this list.

One thing I&apos;ve noticed is how the<br/>&gt; &gt; overall pitch of the partials are &apos;quieter&apos; when the partials<br/>used<br/>&gt; &gt; are Just (*1, *2, *3, *4, *5 etc). Naturally, this is because<br/>&gt; &gt; of &apos;destructive interference&apos; of the partials colliding upon each<br/>&gt; &gt; other throughout the wave. I would be interested to know the<br/>&gt; relative<br/>&gt; &gt; volumes of these - or are they are all quietened down equally?<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; Regards,<br/>&gt; &gt; Daniel (soundburst@l...)<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; daniel,<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; in order to gauge the impact of any destructive interference that<br/>may<br/>&gt; be occuring, we need to know the *phase relationships* of the tones<br/>&gt; you are using. as i tried to explain to pauline, being *in phase*<br/>(or<br/>&gt; in your case, being *out of phase*) is not the same thing as being<br/>&gt; phase-locked.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; perhaps you could provide a few more details of the setup you&apos;re<br/>&gt; using and i could try to assess the acoustical and psychoacoustical<br/>&gt; phenomena that are probably involved.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; right now, my suspicion is that there is no actual destructive<br/>&gt; interference involved, and what you&apos;re experiencing is a simple<br/>&gt; manifestation of the virtual pitch phenomenon -- a set of *harmonic<br/>&gt; partials*, evokes the sense of a single pitch, corresponding to the<br/>&gt; fundamental (even if physically absent) -- while a set of<br/>*inharmonic<br/>&gt; partials* will evoke a multiplicity of pitches, at all the near-<br/>fits<br/>&gt; to a harmonic sub-fundamental that may fit the partials. so it<br/>would<br/>&gt; follow that as you move the partials away from true harmonicity,<br/>&gt; they&apos;ll stick out more as separate pitches (rather than as<br/>components<br/>&gt; of the timbre of the fundamental), and thus you&apos;ll *think* that<br/>&gt; they&apos;re getting louder.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; make sense?</p><p>Yep :) Very interesting too.</p><p>I think you guessed right on what setup I used.
