To make intervals in major and minor triads as close to JI as possible with pure octaves, I used the 16th root of 60 as the generator. The comma I&apos;m tempering out here is 78732/78125 (or &quot;2  9 -7&quot; in terms of prime coordinates), which is only about 13 cents in size. So you can imagine that if I use the 16th root of 60 as the generator, then 6/5 is only one 8th of this comma narrower than just and both 3/2 and 5/4 are only one 16th of this comma away (3/2 is narrower than just, 5/4 is wider than just).</p><p>Petr</p></div><h3><a id=76522 href="#76522">ðŸ”—</a>Carl Lumma &#x3C;carl@...&#x3E;</h3><span>5/21/2008 10:49:38 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, Petr Pa&oslash;&iacute;zek &lt;p.parizek@...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt; It&apos;s a regular temperament.
