We might describe this interval as a<br/>diminished twelfh plus the artificial &quot;quasi-diesis&quot; of ~58.680 cents.</p><p>In contrast, a regular augmented eleventh (e.g. F3-B4) at about<br/>1824.574 cents is only ~3.701 cents narrow of 8:23, thus providing a<br/>more accurate representation.</p><p>We therefore have a situation of _incongruity_: the best approximation<br/>of 8:23 is not equal to the sums of the best approximations of 8:13,<br/>13:18, and 18:23.</p><p>Suppose we seek to use the best representation of 8:23 in another<br/>approximation of 8:13:18:23. The result is, again, incongruity:</p><p>    |------------- ~8:23 (~1824.574, -3.701) -----------|<br/>                      |--- ~13:23 (~982.276, -5.470) ---|<br/>    |--- ~4:9 (~1408.191, +~4.281) ---|<br/>    |----- ~8:13 -----|---- ~13:18 ---|---- ~18:23 -----|<br/>    D4              Bb*4              E5               G#5<br/>          842.297           565.894         416.382<br/>           +1.770            +2.512          -7.982</p><p>In this version, the representations of 8:13, 13:18, and 4:9 are<br/>unchanged, and remain the best.</p><p>However, 18:23 is now represented by the regular major third E5-G#5 at<br/>about 416.382 cents, or ~7.982 cents narrow -- the usual equivalent of<br/>11:14 (~417.508 cents). In contrast, the diminished fourth plus<br/>quasi-diesis of the previous example (C#5-F*5) is only about 2.512<br/>cents wide of 18:23, providing a better representation.</p><p>Also, 13:23 is now represented by the augmented sixth less<br/>quasi-diesis Bb*4-G#5 at ~982.276 cents, or ~5.470 cents narrow, in<br/>contrast to the regular minor seventh G*4-F*5 of the previous example<br/>at only ~4.062 cents wide.</p><p>Thus incongruity in a &quot;real-world&quot; open tuning with a given number of<br/>notes presents dilemmas analogous to those of inconsistency in an<br/>equal or other closed temperament with an intrinsically defined number<br/>of notes.</p><p>Here is a possible definition of incongruity which seeks to include<br/>inconsistency as a subset:</p><p>           A tuning system of any arbitrarily defined size<br/>           exhibits incongruity when at no position is it possible<br/>           to approximate a given multi-voice chord or sonority<br/>           using the best representations available in the system<br/>           for each of the constituent intervals.</p><p>           Inconsistency is incongruity occurring in the specific<br/>           setting of a closed tuning system, and resulting from<br/>           the intrinsically finite size of the closed system<br/>           rather than the arbitrary choice of a given size for<br/>           an open tuning system.</p><p>Most appreciatively,</p><p>Margo Schulter<br/><a href="mailto:mschulter@value.net">mschulter@value.net</a></p></div><h3>wallyesterpaulrus &#x3C;wallyesterpaulrus@yahoo.com&#x3E;</h3><span>10/30/2002 10:24:06 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In tuning@y..., &quot;M.
