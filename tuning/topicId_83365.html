In Rationale this is just a visual aid; it doesn&apos;t affect how the notes are heard, just how you keep track of them.  Kind of like a key change, except simultaneous notes can be in different regions.  Their vertical height is unaffected, but they are shown as different notes depending on their tonal center.</p><p>&gt; I just ordered Schoenberg&apos;s book Saturday.</p><p>I read his Theory of Harmony before university, and found it really inspiring.  Hope your book is a good read.</p><p>&gt; this software sounds interesting - I&apos;ll grab it after work.</p><p>Thanks Chris.  Be warned, it&apos;s about the polar opposite of Shoenberg&apos;s ideas...  Although serialism is one thing Rationale would make far simpler for just intonation.  And I also did get my first taste of understanding intervals from his description of frequency ratios, ironically.</p><p>-Chuckk</p></div>
