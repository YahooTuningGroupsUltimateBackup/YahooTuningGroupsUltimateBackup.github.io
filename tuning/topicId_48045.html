I am working myself up to taking the necessary time to write a piece or pieces for brass quartet/quintet based on the overtone series.  I think I&apos;ve worked out a way to adequately notate this kind of thing.  The difficulty will be to get some players to actually hear and play the pure overtones and not temper the pitches as we are so used to doing.  In my mind the whole problem with this &quot;new tunings&quot; thing is being able to get good live performances.  Anyone involved in this music business understands the dimensional difference between recordings/electronic synthesis, etc. and good live performance--so the problem of actually writing good music that has something universal to communicate and then training enough good musicians to actually get into it and express it is monumental.  I hope you don&apos;t mind me posting this to the tuning list as there may be some<br/> interest in your post to me.  Thanks,</p><p>Bruce</p><p>John Chalmers &lt;<a href="mailto:jhchalmers@ucsd.edu">jhchalmers@ucsd.edu</a>&gt; wrote:<br/>Bruce: I saw your post to the tuning list. A few years ago, Brian Lee discovered<br/>that Kathleen Schlesinger and her composer friend Elsie Hamilton were<br/>Anthroposophists and that the headquarters in Dornach had a few of her scores as<br/>autographs. Unfortunately, the pieces excerpted in The Greek Aulos were not<br/>among them except for a Hymn to Ra from Sensa. Anyway, Hamilton wrote a short<br/>essay which equivalenced KS&apos;s harmoniai to Steiner&apos;s planetary scales. So, if<br/>you are interested in writing Anthroposophical music, you might consider her<br/>system of 7 diatonic 7-tone scales derived from the subharmonic series.</p><p>--John</p><p>---------------------------------<br/>Do you Yahoo!?<br/>The New Yahoo!

His name was Josip Stolcer Slavenski, born Cakovec 1895, died Belgrade 1955, and among his music are some studies for the ancestor of our synths., the Trautonium.<br/>Sounds, like all his music, very strange and beautyful, though his more traditional works seem to be something like &quot;continuing Romantics with different means&quot;.<br/>It must have been a topic of that time of dissolving tonality to search for new ordering principles, as if musicians were afraid of the dawning freedom of non-organized &quot;atonality&quot; as suggested by early Schoenberg in the times of &quot;Der Blaue Reiter&quot;, expressionism etc.</p><p>Think that was it so far...<br/>Bye<br/>Werner</p></div><h3>Aaron K.
