I&apos;ve always been<br/>flabbergasted at his talent.  I think I see at least a little<br/>of what you&apos;re &apos;trying to get at here&apos;.  Often it seems that<br/>Tatum is creating a wash of sound that is trying to transcend<br/>12-tET altogether.</p><p>The one other artist whose work I react to like this is one<br/>I&apos;ve written about here often:  Jimi Hendrix.  Of course, Hendrix<br/>actually *was* microtonal because he was a master of the<br/>pitch-bend - one of the greatest, if you ask me.  But he was<br/>still to a large extent working &apos;with&apos; (or is it &apos;within&apos;  ;-)<br/>12-tET, since that was the basis of his instrument.</p><p>In a way, this comparison makes Tatum&apos;s achievement all the more<br/>remarkable.</p><p>-monz<br/><a href="http://www.ixpres.com/interval/monzo/homepage.html">http://www.ixpres.com/interval/monzo/homepage.html</a></p></div>
