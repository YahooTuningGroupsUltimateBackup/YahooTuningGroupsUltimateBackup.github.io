It&apos;s not really all that long,<br/>so it shouldn&apos;t be so difficult to &quot;scroll through.&quot;  Admittedly, this is<br/>not a technical article, but intended for the general reader...  I hope<br/>somebody finds it interesting (??)</p><p>Ondar and the Eagles of Tuva, with Tom Rutishauser, cello and Joe Pereira,<br/>percussion, The Knitting Factory, Sunday, January 16, 8 PM</p><p>A recent issue of Scientific American, September 1999, describes the vocal<br/>methods of Tuvan folksingers in detail from an acoustical perspective.<br/>Tuva is an autonomous republic within Russia (now officially called Tyva)<br/>isolated, and wedged between Soviet Siberia and Outer Mongolia.  Suffice it<br/>to say that people have time on their hands there, and over the centuries<br/>they have developed a singing method that, essentially, does not use the<br/>vocal cords to make pitch.  Instead, the Tuvans set up a low &quot;growling&quot;<br/>vibration and use this to, basically, &quot;play&quot; their own throats (!)</p><p>Any closed space, in this case the throat cavity, contains certain defined<br/>acoustical properties.  If set to vibrate or make a sound, there are<br/>certain tones that are naturally produced, depending on shape and size of<br/>the space.  In addition to the &quot;fundamental&quot; note, there are &quot;overtones,&quot;<br/>multiples of the basic frequency that &quot;go along for the ride.&quot;  These<br/>&quot;little sounds&quot; of higher frequency are at simple, integer multiples of the<br/>fundamental frequency.  They are always there in any vibrating space or<br/>produced sound, unless it is the rare vibration that is so precise and pure<br/>that no overtones come along with it.  Such sounds are generally pretty<br/>dull.</p><p>It so happens that pitches made by the vocal cords also set up their OWN<br/>series of overtones, in addition to the set of &quot;potential&quot; ones in the<br/>throat cavity.  It is the tradition of the Tuvan throat singers, mostly<br/>through changing the size of the vocal cavity with the tongue,  to adjust<br/>the throat so that the overtones from the vocal cords and from the<br/>resonating vocal cavity ALIGN.  When this happens there is magic -- the<br/>harmonics are strongly enforced, resulting in a disembodied &quot;whistling&quot;<br/>effect that sounds quite a bit different from anything we would expect to<br/>hear coming from a human mouth.</p><p>The Tuvans invented this technique, are great at it, and their folk music<br/>incorporates this throat whistling as a primary element.  The overtone<br/>series generated from the voice also determines their choice of pitches<br/>sung &quot;ordinarily&quot; at times.  They use a kind of &quot;blues&quot; scale mixed with a<br/>basic pentatonic: by including the 7th harmonic partial -- the &quot;blues note&quot;<br/>Bb, they have a modified pentatonic scale of G, Bb, C, D, E, F, G.  This<br/>scale has a &quot;blusey, jazzy&quot; feel, which is probably why the Tuvans are so<br/>popular at the Knitting Factory.</p><p>The Knitting Factory was &quot;packed&quot; for this event.  Essentially, there<br/>wasn&apos;t even standing room.  Who would have thought that Tuvans from remote<br/>regions near Outer Siberia would attract this kind of attention?  Well,<br/>there is a new interest in &quot;world musics,&quot; particularly if they have some<br/>relation to the jazz and blues that we know, and I believe this is<br/>partially the cause of this &quot;Tuvan hysteria.&quot;</p><p>And Ondar and his gang are talented.  Ondar, himself, is different than one<br/>might expect from his name.  He is a rather pleasant, refined little guy.<br/>They also have great costumes -- the traditional Tuvan garb, elaborate,<br/>regal, tastefully colored, even with crowns, and heavy.  No thermal<br/>underwear is necessary for Tuvans...  Just seeing  the ensemble in their<br/>native costumes is worth the price of admission.</p><p>Several different &quot;numbers&quot; were sung (or rather &quot;intoned&quot;) by Ondar and<br/>his &quot;Eagles.&quot;  Virtually all of these are songs which have some<br/>relationship to natural geography --  the Tuvans are, as one might expect,<br/>very involved with their outdoor environment, since this is where they are<br/>most all the time.  They use accompanying instruments, including the<br/>&quot;igil,&quot; a two-stringed upright fiddle made from horse parts: hide, hair and<br/>gut.  Frequently they use this instrument to make equine sounds -- they&apos;re<br/>a little literal in this respect.  For me, most fascinating was Ondar&apos;s<br/>solo singing, in the grand Tuvan throat singing tradition.  After a few<br/>huge gulps of air, he begins resonating his vocal cavity, and the whistling<br/>overtones become quite loud.  It&apos;s very weird.</p><p>One final comment concerns the relationship of this music to other folk<br/>musics, including those of the United States.  It is somewhat surprising<br/>how similar the Tuvan folk music is to our own blues and cowboy songs.<br/>There is a certain internationalism to generic folk music that is just now<br/>beginning to be recognized --most probably due to our recent technological<br/>advances in communication. Perhaps some of these &quot;cross over&quot; elements<br/>account for the extraordinary popularity of these exotic music here, today,<br/>in our own country.</p><p>Filling out the ensemble were a couple of well-known New York musicians,<br/>Tom Rutishauser, cello and Joe Pereira, percussionist with the New York<br/>Philharmonic.  What were they doing with Ondar and the gang?  Just<br/>&quot;jamming&quot; along.  All were welcome.</p><p>Joseph Pehrson</p></div><h3><a id=8074 href="#8074">ðŸ”—</a>Paul H.

However,<br/>that is not the case for the frequencies referred to in the first paragraph<br/>above, which are the resonances of the vocal cavity. The frequencies of the<br/>resonances will vary with respect to one another as the size and shape of<br/>the vocal cavity is altered by the singer.</p><p>Joe&apos;s description of the &quot;whistling&quot; is essentially correct.</p></div>
