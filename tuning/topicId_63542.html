And, what I didn&apos;t realize was that when you go up 9 5ths, you come to a D# at about 318 cents, which is just about a perfect flat 3rd...but, all of the traditional Pythagorean tunings I&apos;ve seen over the years, use the 294 cent b3  (32/27). I&apos;m assuming that this is because it&apos;s a smaller ratio, but it&apos;s not as close to the 6/5 as the other one. And, it&apos;s also interesting that you can get an almost pure maj 3rd by going down 8 5ths, but again, the 81/64 at 408 cents is the one you usually see given in Pythagorean scales. So, why didn&apos;t European theorists over the years just use those close to perfect 3rds instead of the more out of tune (for chords) ones? What am I missing?<br/>  Jeez, this is pretty basic stuff I&apos;m sure, but I&apos;m still learning about this topic. The Sruti book is a real eye opener, and talking to Haresh is real interesting as well, as he points out that traditionally, Indian musicians learned the location of the pitches by the more direct method of copying the sensei, not by any sort of mathematical calculations. And, I&apos;ve also come to understand that Arabic music was also transmitted in this way as well, and I imagine, actually, that most musicians around the world learned this way too. It was mainly the European method of writing everything down that changed this way of learning.<br/>  So, if one was learning pitch placement as an intregal part of a piece (raga/maqam), then as the needs of the piece changed from form to form, the pitch of a particular note would change as well, but only because of the need to express a different emotion/feeling, not as a mathematical formula divorced from the actual experience of playing the music. And, I guess this is the age old division of theory versus actual musical practice...musicians place notes where they will best express what the music is communicating, but if theory is formulated as something not connected to actual playing, than perhaps it is not as real as the music itself.<br/>  Can Akkoc&apos;s paper on non deterministic scales seems to be right on the money as far as actual musical practice is concerned, since musicians may be putting pitches other places than the so called theoretical models say. And, as I&apos;ve often mentioned, blues pitch bending is not tied down to any one theoretical concept...a note area is real fluid, and can change from moment to moment.<br/>  In fact, I&apos;ve come to realize that, for me, if I had to sum up the most important thing I&apos;ve learned from my study of tunings, it&apos;s the fact that a note&apos;s pitch is in an AREA of the pitch continuum, not tied down to a specific place, as in an instrument like the piano, where a note only has one position. Learning that has been most liberating, and has greatly affected the way I think about, and play, music.

And, what I didn&apos;t realize was that when you go up 9 5ths,</p><p>That takes you out of any Pythagorean diatonic scale that includes<br/>your starding point.</p><p>&gt; you come to<br/>&gt; a D# at about 318 cents, which is just about a perfect flat<br/>3rd...but, all<br/>&gt; of the traditional Pythagorean tunings I&apos;ve seen over the years,<br/>use the 294<br/>&gt; cent b3  (32/27).</p><p>This is the diatonic one, down 3 fifths.</p><p>This issue has come up in many contexts. But you must have especially<br/>missed the discussions of Western tuning practice in part of the 15th<br/>century, which has been referred to as &quot;schismatic&quot;, before meantone.<br/>Lindley discusses this in his book. Keyboard tuners would sometimes,<br/>during this period, tune a chain of pure fifths from Gb to B, but<br/>much of the associated music &quot;looks&quot; like it&apos;s in a key of two to<br/>four sharps. So the resulting almost-pure intervals would be:</p><p>D-Gb: 384 cents<br/>A-Db: 384 cents<br/>E-Ab: 384 cents<br/>B-Eb: 384 cents<br/>Gb-A: 318 cents<br/>Db-E: 318 cents<br/>Ab-B: 318 cents</p><p>&gt; I&apos;m assuming that this is because it&apos;s a smaller ratio,</p><p>Smaller?</p><p>&gt; but it&apos;s not as close to the 6/5 as the other one. And, it&apos;s also<br/>&gt; interesting that you can get an almost pure maj 3rd by going down 8<br/>5ths,</p><p>That takes you out of any Pythagorean diatonic scale that includes<br/>your starding point.</p><p>&gt; but again, the 81/64 at 408 cents is the one you usually see given<br/>in<br/>&gt; Pythagorean scales.</p><p>That&apos;s the diatonic one you get by going up 4 fifths.</p><p>&gt; So, why didn&apos;t European theorists over the years just<br/>&gt; use those close to perfect 3rds instead of the more out of tune<br/>(for chords)<br/>&gt; ones?</p><p>They did for a few decades in the 15th century, but there were a lot<br/>of problems with this approach, which were ultimately solved by<br/>meantone, which tempers each fifth by about 5 cents, and brings the<br/>diatonic major and minor thirds close to purity.</p><p>&gt; What am I missing?</p><p>Here are four things:</p><p>(1) You can&apos;t even get all the chords in a single diatonic scale to<br/>be in tune with the 15th century 12-note schismatic strategy. If you<br/>to exploit the schismatic thirds in a key of two or three sharps,<br/>you&apos;ll see that B-F#, which is now tuned B-Gb, is a wolf fifth, and B-<br/>D is the rough 32:27. In a key of four sharps, D#-F# is tuned Eb-Gb<br/>which is again the rough 32:27.</p><p>(2) You can start adding more notes to allow for schismatic thirds<br/>and pure fifths in more places but the number you need grows with the<br/>number of keys you want to play in, and are separated from notes you<br/>already have by a comma (a small interval for fretted instruments, to<br/>be sure).</p><p>(3) If you&apos;ve added all the extra notes you could need and play<br/>harmonic progressions such as I-vi-ii-V-I or I-vi-IV-V-I (or myriad<br/>other examples that can be found in almost every piece), you have to<br/>either let a note shift by a comma when it&apos;s repeated (or worse yet,<br/>being held) from one chord to the next -- a melodically unsettling<br/>effect; or let the entire progression drift by a comma so that you<br/>end up at a different pitch level even though the music hasn&apos;t<br/>modulated -- and these drifts can add up over the course of a piece!</p><p>(4) Consider a chord with the following intervals over the tonic:<br/>major third, perfect fifth, major sixth, major ninth. How would you<br/>tune it so that all the consonant intervals stay consonant?</p><p>&gt;    Jeez, this is pretty basic stuff I&apos;m sure, but I&apos;m still<br/>learning about<br/>&gt; this topic.</p><p>The books by Helmholtz and Barbour both discuss schismatic<br/>approaches, so you may want to review them.</p><p>&gt;    In fact, I&apos;ve come to realize that, for me, if I had to sum up<br/>the most<br/>&gt; important thing I&apos;ve learned from my study of tunings, it&apos;s the<br/>fact that a<br/>&gt; note&apos;s pitch is in an AREA of the pitch continuum, not tied down to<br/>a<br/>&gt; specific place, as in an instrument like the piano, where a note<br/>only has<br/>&gt; one position. Learning that has been most liberating, and has<br/>greatly<br/>&gt; affected the way I think about, and play, music. If I had to tell<br/>beginning<br/>&gt; students one profound truth about what tuning was all about, that<br/>would be<br/>&gt; it (and yes, I know there&apos;s many important facets of<br/>tuning)...best...HHH</p><p>That&apos;s cool, I agree, and I note that it flies in the face of some of<br/>the JI propaganda about.</p></div><h3><a id=63697 href="#63697">ðŸ”—</a>Gene Ward Smith &#x3C;gwsmith@svpal.org&#x3E;</h3><span>1/25/2006 4:56:18 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;wallyesterpaulrus&quot;<br/>&lt;wallyesterpaulrus@y...&gt; wrote:</p><p>&gt; (2) You can start adding more notes to allow for schismatic thirds<br/>&gt; and pure fifths in more places but the number you need grows with the<br/>&gt; number of keys you want to play in, and are separated from notes you<br/>&gt; already have by a comma (a small interval for fretted instruments, to<br/>&gt; be sure).</p><p>I suspect Neil, at least, could handle the commas.
