There is no need to use a tone like this. I make my living as a<br/>composer and many of the other list participants compose as well. So when<br/>we post some technical information about a tunings it is not empty<br/>theoretical posturing but relates to real artistic work.</p><p>--------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>Dear Dr.Daniel Wolf and alternative tuners and composers,</p><p>Please accept my sincere apologies...</p><p>I was, actually joking when I said this!</p><p>Its a shame that the E-Mail mode of communication dosen&apos;t enable the users<br/>to convey tone of voice, or for that matter body language, as well as the<br/>basic information package.</p><p>I will be putting this E-Mail on the alternative tuning list to let the<br/>others know.</p><p>Well, my own tunings are at this stage theoretical, altho I have a recording<br/>lined up in mid-1999 with two friends.</p><p>And you?Have you done any composing?I would very definitely like to hear it!</p><p>Thankyou for the advice.</p><p>What I may have to do, actually is to start from scratch-chords, intervals,<br/>inversions, and use this IN COMBINATION with 12 Equal Temperament<br/>mapping/overlayering.</p><p>Ivor Darreg has done things along those lines.</p><p>The idea is, after all, to experiment.<br/>And to learn from trial and error, and, as I say-our mistakes.</p><p>So you say David Cope uses a &quot;cut/paste/mixup/splice&quot; technique a lot?<br/>Does David Cope not use any sort of &quot;structured/random phrase mutation and<br/>creation algorithm&quot;, to change the notes/phrases a little/a lot, so that<br/>they don&apos;t just sound like Mozart using a jig-saw type arrangement or, a<br/>pair of sissors, glue, a biscuit barrel (to mix the bits up<br/>blindly/randomly), and a peice of backing cardboard?</p><p>Surely David Cope must change the notes of his compositions just A LITLE<br/>(via intervals, pitch, chords, timing), so that they are not just variations<br/>on a theme, albeit mixed up?</p><p>Please comment on this, as I am very interested.</p><p>Do you know of any true AI type composition generation programs for the PC,<br/>and PowerMac?</p><p>And as for rythmic parsing, well-you could always just add your own by hand.</p><p>I also wanted to ask you, has anybody set standardised keys or modes for 19<br/>Equal temperament, for example?</p><p>I mean, if 12 ET has 2 main keys:major (TTSTTTS) and<br/>minor(TSTTSTT),(excluding harmonic minor), then would 19 ET have, say 3 keys?</p><p>I have a feeling that microtonalizing SARA will not be as easy as I first<br/>thought.</p><p>I hope to hear from you,</p><p>Sincerely,</p><p>---Sarn Ursell---</p></div>
