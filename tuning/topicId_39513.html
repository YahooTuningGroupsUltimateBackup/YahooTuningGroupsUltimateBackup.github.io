The reason being that there are<br/>necessary assumptions to bridge those steps which are<br/>often disagreed with.  But even if I disagree with<br/>some or all of them, the last very unlikely, I still<br/>can see where it goes and if it is internally<br/>consistent with itself.</p><p>Re:<br/>&gt;Robert Karl Stonjek writes, &quot;Time has been confused with some<br/>&gt;axes of a graph for long enough.  Geometry is not space and<br/>&gt;it is not time, but the line is easily crossed and so they<br/>&gt;sometimes seem to be synonymous.&quot;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;Suppose I gave you a formula that shows a proportional<br/>&gt;relationship between Time and Space and Distance?  Would<br/>&gt;you be interested in discussing it?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;Bill Arnold</p><p>=========================================================<br/>My, Bill Arnold&apos;s, remarks:<br/>Sure, let&apos;s take it slow, for those interested.  And for those<br/>not:<br/>from my point of view it relates to all the message boards<br/>cross-posted, and those uninterested, please just hit delete,<br/>as there are multi-disciplinary minds on these respective boards.<br/>If a list member wishes to join one of the other cross-posted<br/>lists mentioned above, and others wish this subject message not<br/>cross- posted to their list, I will abide by their wishes and take<br/>it off-list only to those other lists.  Unfortunately, the added<br/>brilliance of these respective minds might be lost.</p><p>In Cycles Bulletin, Vol. XXX, No. 4, 1979, in &quot;Bode&apos;s Law Explained:<br/>On the Definitive Directions, Dimensions and Proportions of Our<br/>Solar-Planetary System,&quot; among other things, I wrote, &quot;if there is<br/>a physical law relating distance, periodicty, speed and space as I<br/>believe there is as I outlined in my first letter (Cycles, Volume 28,<br/>Number 9, December, 1977), as observed by the formula pi d = tr<br/>(discussed at length in this letter), then it will add much to our<br/>knowledge of the solar-planetary system and will aid us in constructing<br/>a &quot;physical&quot; model.&quot;  I also wrote therein, &quot;The so-called planetary<br/>distance law, inherent within pi d = tr, that is, d = tr/pi, and apply<br/>it fully to the solar-planetary system model under developement...this<br/>formula is derived from equating the perimeter of the unitary circle<br/>(pi = 3.14etc.d) with the distance travelled by an orbiting body (D = tr).<br/>Thus, pi d = tr.  This elastic space (pi = tr/d) and elastic time<br/>(t = pi d/r) and elastic speed (r = pi d/t) and elastic distance<br/>(d = tr/pi) formula is the space-time-speed distance continuum formula<br/>so necessary to correlating the &quot;whole&quot; system to its constituent parts.&quot;<br/>and I might add, musically, for those still believe that the solar-system<br/>planets make Music of the Spheres in their oribtals round our sun.</p><p>So, simply put, the formula is:</p><p>pi d = tr</p><p>arrived at by knowing to be true:</p><p>C = pi d</p><p>and</p><p>D = tr</p><p>hence, for any body in space moving round a relatively<br/>stationary center,</p><p>the D traveled on the Circumference can be equated<br/>with THAT circumference</p><p>hence, pi d = tr</p><p>t is time traveled</p><p>r is rate of speed traveled or call it speed so<br/>as not to confuse letters for radii, if used</p><p>C is circumference of the circle described by d (diameter,<br/>or 2r for 2 radii can be substituted, for some interesting<br/>thoughts on the &quot;octave&quot;)</p><p>pi is 3.14+ad infinitum [I have it to 40 places for those<br/>interested]</p><p>OK: for those interested, have at it!<br/>Bill Arnold</p><p>Bill Arnold<br/><a href="mailto:billarnoldfla@yahoo.com">billarnoldfla@yahoo.com</a><br/><a href="http://www.cwru.edu/affil/edis/scholars/arnold.htm">http://www.cwru.edu/affil/edis/scholars/arnold.htm</a><br/>Independent Scholar<br/>Independent Scholar, Modern Language Association<br/>-------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>  &quot;There is magic in the web&quot; Shakespeare (Othello, Act 3, Scene 4)<br/>-------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p>__________________________________________________<br/>Do you Yahoo!?<br/>Faith Hill - Exclusive Performances, Videos &amp; More<br/><a href="http://faith.yahoo.com">http://faith.yahoo.com</a></p></div>
