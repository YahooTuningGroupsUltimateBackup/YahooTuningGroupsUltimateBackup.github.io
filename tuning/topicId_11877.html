The fifths are tempered by<br/>&gt; around 1.49 cents in the wide direction (and fourths in the narrow<br/>&gt; direction), leaving these intervals quite close to pure.<br/>&gt;</p><p>I got around this problem of purity of 4ths and 5ths by stacking two symmtrical keyboards on<br/>top of each other.  I literally hacked off the bottom of one keyboard so that it could sit at<br/>about a 45 degree angle to a more horizontal keyboard below.  I used to have a Proteus that<br/>could go as far as 23 tones per octave and stacking two of these made for a fine hybrid 46<br/>tone.  I am still in awe of the beauty of that hybrid scale.  Maybe if you were up to it, you<br/>could get your 29 tone and make a stacked hybrid setup that would make for a hybrid 58 tone<br/>scale.</p><p>I don&apos;t add anything new below.  I am not currently reading in depth any technical discussions<br/>because I broke my Proteus and I am waiting for a new computer based sampler before I start<br/>testing the technical discussions of the egroup.</p><p>&gt;<br/>&gt; If asked for an overall impression of the tuning, I might say, &quot;rather<br/>&gt; mild, gentle, and charming.&quot; As a close neighbor of Pythagorean,<br/>&gt; 29-tet offers some intriguing shades of difference; at the same time,<br/>&gt; it&apos;s on the mild side of 17-tet, which is a bit more of a clearly<br/>&gt; _neo_-Gothic tuning.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Major thirds in 29-tet at ~413.38 cents are not too far from<br/>&gt; Pythagorean, and about midway between a Pythagorean 81:64 (~407.82<br/>&gt; cents) or a 19:15 (~409.24 cents) and a 14:11 (~417.51 cents). I like<br/>&gt; them very much in certain voicelike timbres on a Yamaha TX-802<br/>&gt; synthesizer, and also for example in a mixture of two harpischord-like<br/>&gt; timbres.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; A slight timbral nuance: while I tend in Pythagorean to play the lower<br/>&gt; voices with the richer harpsichord-like timbre, in 29-tet I tend to<br/>&gt; use this timbre for the upper parts, and a more &quot;harp-like&quot; or<br/>&gt; &quot;lute-like&quot; registration for the lower parts. Possibly this preference<br/>&gt; reflects the somewhat greater acoustical tension involving the fifth<br/>&gt; partial of the richer timbre in 29-tet. The goal in either case is a<br/>&gt; &quot;semi-concordant&quot; major third, at once pleasant and intriguing in<br/>&gt; itself, and moving toward some expected resolution.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Interestingly, the 29-tet minor third at ~289.66 cents is an excellent<br/>&gt; approximation of 13:11 (~289.21 cents), and this interval very nicely<br/>&gt; contracts to a unison -- or expands to a fifth also in 13th-century<br/>&gt; styles.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Major seconds at ~206.90 cents and minor sevenths at ~993.10 cents are<br/>&gt; around 2.99 cents from their pure Pythagorean counterparts at 9:8 and<br/>&gt; 16:9. These intervals and the near-pure fifths and fourths produce<br/>&gt; very nice Gothic or neo-Gothic sonorities such as 4:6:9, 9:12:16,<br/>&gt; 6:8:9, and 8:9:12.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; A pleasant feature of this tuning, both in its mathematical simplicity<br/>&gt; and in its aural effect, is the division of the whole-tone into five<br/>&gt; equal parts. The usual diatonic semitone or limma is 2/5-tone or<br/>&gt; ~82.76 cents, a very nice size for usual cadences, and narrower than<br/>&gt; the already compact Pythagorean interval of 256:243 (~90.22 cents) or<br/>&gt; about 4/9-tone. The chromatic semitone or apotome is 3/5-tone or<br/>&gt; ~124.14 cents, an interval lending its flavor to a neat cadential<br/>&gt; variation.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; This variation brings us to the topic of alternative thirds (augmented<br/>&gt; seconds and diminished fourths) in 29-tet, another neat nuance of this<br/>&gt; tuning. While Pythagorean versions of these intervals (&quot;schisma<br/>&gt; thirds&quot;) very closely approach 5-limit ratios, 29-tet gives them their<br/>&gt; own distinct character. Our alternative major third or diminished<br/>&gt; fourth is ~372.41 cents, and our alternative minor third or augmented<br/>&gt; second is ~331.03 cents.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; These intervals differ from 5:4 and 6:5 by amounts roughly comparable<br/>&gt; to regular major and minor thirds in 12-tet -- but in the opposite<br/>&gt; directions, of course, maybe approaching the &quot;zones of influence&quot; of<br/>&gt; intervals such as 21:17 (~365.83 cents) or 17:14 (~336.13 cents).  A<br/>&gt; tuning like my &quot;e-based hypermeantone&quot; (with the ratio between the<br/>&gt; whole-tone and diatonic semitone equal to Euler&apos;s e, ~2.71828) takes<br/>&gt; us more clearly into such zones of influence, but the intermediate<br/>&gt; realm of 29-tet can have its own special attractions.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Thus in 29-tet both the regular and alternative thirds have an active<br/>&gt; quality, and the latter intervals invite resolutions like the<br/>&gt; following involving the wide chromatic semitone or apotome, with C4 as<br/>&gt; middle C and higher note numbers showing higher octaves. Vertical<br/>&gt; intervals in cents are shown in parentheses, while signed numbers show<br/>&gt; melodic intervals in the ascending (positive) or descending (negative)<br/>&gt; directions:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;   Bb3 -- ~+124.14 -- C4<br/>&gt; (~331.03)         (~703.45)<br/>&gt;   G3  -- ~-206.90 -- F3<br/>&gt; (~372.41)           (0.00)<br/>&gt;   Eb3 -- ~+124.14 -- F3<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;        (m3-1 + M3-5)<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; The difference between the diatonic and chromatic semitones is<br/>&gt; 1/5-tone, or one scale step -- about 41.38 cents. Interestingly this<br/>&gt; is very close to the 128:125 diesis of 1/4-comma meantone (~41.06<br/>&gt; cents), and maybe invites some experiments in neo-Gothic chromaticism<br/>&gt; with melodic figures alternating between these contrasting semitones.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; ---------------------------------------------------------------<br/>&gt; 2. Quasi-historical aspects: 29-tet and &quot;ultra-Gothic&quot; cadences<br/>&gt; ---------------------------------------------------------------<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; As a tuning system which rather closely approximates Pythagorean while<br/>&gt; dividing the whole-tone into five equal parts, 29-tet has another and<br/>&gt; more &quot;radical&quot; side. It permits variants on the usual cadences<br/>&gt; featuring the use of a melodic &quot;diesis&quot; of only 1/5-tone or ~41.38<br/>&gt; cents, and &quot;superwide&quot; major thirds near 13:10 and major sixths near<br/>&gt; 26:15.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Before getting into the possible &quot;quasi-historical&quot; implications of<br/>&gt; these progressions, let&apos;s look at a characteristic example, using the<br/>&gt; ASCII asterisk (*) to show a note raised by a diesis or 1/5-tone:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;   E*4 --  ~+41.38 -- F4<br/>&gt; (~951.72)         (1200.00)<br/>&gt;   B*3 --  ~+41.38 -- C4<br/>&gt; (~455.17)         (~703.45)<br/>&gt;   G3  -- ~-206.90 -- F3<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;        (Mx3-5 + Mx6-8)<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Here the cadential major third expanding to a fifth is a diesis wider<br/>&gt; than usual, or ~455.17 cents, very close to 13:10 (~454.21 cents); and<br/>&gt; likewise the major sixth (~951.72 cents) expanding to an octave, very<br/>&gt; close to 26:15 (~952.26 cents). To show that these intervals differ<br/>&gt; from usual major thirds and sixths, I call them &quot;maximal&quot; thirds and<br/>&gt; sixths, or Mx3 and Mx6, thus notating this cadence as (Mx3-5 + Mx6-8).<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; As a feature of neo-medieval style, this kind of &quot;ultra-Gothic&quot;<br/>&gt; cadence can be very striking, and I like the effect especially with<br/>&gt; certain voice-like timbres on synthesizer.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Now for the quasi-historical part, which the Monz (and maybe others)<br/>&gt; may have anticipated. Marchettus of Padua, in his _Lucidarium_ of<br/>&gt; 1318, advocates that singers follow an intonation based on the usual<br/>&gt; 2:1 octaves, 3:2 fifths, 4:3 fourths, and 9:8 whole-tones of<br/>&gt; Pythagorean tuning -- but deriving other intervals, especially certain<br/>&gt; cadential ones, from a division of the whole-tone into &quot;five parts.&quot;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Each of these parts is known as a &quot;diesis,&quot; and here the<br/>&gt; interpretive debate swiftly gets under way. Are these dieses equal or<br/>&gt; unequal? Is the &quot;fivefold division&quot; of the tone a geometric one<br/>&gt; (calling for the element of a temperament) or possibly an arithmetic<br/>&gt; one (as in a monochord division)? Are the &quot;five parts&quot; of the tone a<br/>&gt; mathematical formulation, or more of a guide for singers -- who are<br/>&gt; not bound to any fixed tuning?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Of special interest is the cadential diesis of Marchettus, which he<br/>&gt; defines as equal to &quot;one of the five parts of a tone.&quot; If this is an<br/>&gt; equal or roughly equal division, than a cadence like the above<br/>&gt; &quot;ultra-Gothic&quot; example would result.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; While scholars including our own Monz have come up with many ingenious<br/>&gt; interpretations of Marchettus, there is one passage which to me<br/>&gt; suggests that 29-tet may in fact provide one intriguing realization<br/>&gt; of his cadential aesthetics.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; In his discussion of the resolution of unstable intervals or<br/>&gt; &quot;dissonances&quot; -- Marchettus refers to thirds and sixths as &quot;tolerable<br/>&gt; dissonances,&quot; while 14th-century writers in the French tradition, for<br/>&gt; example, tend to call them &quot;imperfect concords&quot; or the like -- he<br/>&gt; compares two resolutions of the cadential major sixth, one standard<br/>&gt; and the other a &quot;feigned color&quot; (loosely translated, a &quot;deceptive<br/>&gt; cadential inflection&quot;):<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; D4   C#4  D4              D4   C#4  C4<br/>&gt; D3   E3   D3              D3   E3   F3<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; 8    M6   8               8    M6   5<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; In the notation of Marchettus, the C# shows that the note C is raised<br/>&gt; by an extra-wide &quot;chromatic semitone&quot; equal to &quot;four parts of a tone,&quot;<br/>&gt; leaving only &quot;one part of a tone&quot; for the remaining diesis C#-D. The<br/>&gt; problem which Marchettus considers is why the first resolution is<br/>&gt; standard, while the second is less expected and favored.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Having earlier explained that a cadential dissonance should approach<br/>&gt; the consonance which it seeks (e.g. M3-5, M6-8) as closely as possible<br/>&gt; -- thus calling for the cadential diesis of only &quot;one of the five<br/>&gt; parts&quot; of a tone -- he remarks that the major sixth of these two<br/>&gt; progressions is equally far from either the octave or the fifth. Thus<br/>&gt; the question arises: why does the standard resolution to the octave<br/>&gt; seem better to fit the norm of &quot;closest approach&quot;?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; One answer, the first offered by Marchettus, is that the octave at 2:1<br/>&gt; is a purer consonance than the fifth at 3:2, and thus a more<br/>&gt; satisfying destination for the major sixth, located as it is &quot;six<br/>&gt; dieses&quot; from either stable goal. However, both the framing of the<br/>&gt; question, and the second answer of Marchettus, are of special<br/>&gt; interest.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; In saying that a cadential major sixth is equally &quot;six dieses&quot; from<br/>&gt; either the octave or the fifth, Marchettus may be implying that his<br/>&gt; dieses are at least roughly equal, so that one can validly compare<br/>&gt; distances between intervals using them.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; In 29-tet, an extra-wide or &quot;maximal&quot; major sixth at 23 steps is<br/>&gt; indeed precisely 6/5-tone (or 6/29 octave) from either the usual goal<br/>&gt; of the octave (29 steps) or the less usual goal by contrary motion of<br/>&gt; the fifth (17 steps). This doesn&apos;t mean that Marchettus necessarily<br/>&gt; intended vocal intonation precisely in 29-tet, or using this scale as<br/>&gt; the basis for an &quot;adaptive JI&quot; scheme to make fifths, fourths, and<br/>&gt; major seconds pure -- only that 29-tet seems to realize the idea of a<br/>&gt; cadential major sixth (or &quot;maximal sixth&quot;) about equally far from the<br/>&gt; octave or the fifth.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; As his second answer to the problem of why the resolution to the<br/>&gt; octave is more favored, Marchettus analyzes the melodic motion of each<br/>&gt; voice in the cadence. Generally, he presents ideal cadential action as<br/>&gt; involving movement by _both_ voices in contrary motion: both voices<br/>&gt; share in the &quot;dissonance,&quot; and both participate in its resolution.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Comparing the two resolutions by contrary motion of the major sixth,<br/>&gt; he notes that in the usual resolution to the octave, the lower voice<br/>&gt; descends by a regular whole-tone or five dieses, while the upper voice<br/>&gt; ascends by one diesis, the narrowest possible interval of the system.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; In contrast, in the unusual resolution to the fifth, the lower voice<br/>&gt; ascends by the usual diatonic semitone or limma (to Marchettus, an<br/>&gt; &quot;enharmonic semitone&quot;) of two dieses, while the upper voice descends<br/>&gt; by its wide &quot;chromatic semitone&quot; of four dieses.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; If we look at these progressions in 29-tet, using the maximal sixth in<br/>&gt; either case, these descriptions exactly and intuitively fit. Here<br/>&gt; numbers in parentheses show vertical intervals in scale steps, and<br/>&gt; signed numbers show melodic motion in scale steps or &quot;dieses&quot;:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; C#*4 -- +1 -- D4              C#*4 -- -4 -- C4<br/>&gt; (23)         (29)             (23)         (17)<br/>&gt; E3   -- -5 -- D3              E3   -- +2 -- F3<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Mx6           8               Mx6           5<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Marchettus explains that the usual resolution to the octave is more<br/>&gt; satisfying in part because one of the voices moves by the narrowest<br/>&gt; interval possible, the cadential diesis equal to &quot;one of the five<br/>&gt; parts&quot; of a tone -- here C#*-D in the upper voice. In contrast, the<br/>&gt; smallest interval involved in the unusual resolution to the fifth is<br/>&gt; the usual semitone of &quot;two dieses,&quot; here E3-F3 in the lower voice.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; At the least, this comparison of the cadential M6-8 and M6-5<br/>&gt; progressions suggests that Marchettus indeed regards the cadential<br/>&gt; diesis as substantially smaller than the usual semitone or limma --<br/>&gt; with the 29-tet distinction between these melodic intervals at<br/>&gt; 2/5-tone and 1/5-tone nicely fitting the terms of his comparison.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; In a slightly different realization, one could tune the cadential<br/>&gt; major thirds and sixths (our &quot;maximal&quot; thirds and sixths) at precisely<br/>&gt; 13:10 and 26:15 in a JI system with a 3-odd-limit of stability but a<br/>&gt; 13-prime-limit or higher for generating unstable intervals. Many<br/>&gt; neo-Gothic temperaments including 29-tet tend to approximate such a<br/>&gt; state of affairs.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Finally, I should note that the 29-tet interval of 23 steps can be<br/>&gt; used either as a Marchettus-like(?) &quot;maximal sixth&quot; or as a &quot;minimal<br/>&gt; seventh&quot; regularly resolving to the fifth by a progression featuring a<br/>&gt; cadential diesis, e.g.:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; D4  -- -5 -- C4<br/>&gt; (23)        (17)<br/>&gt; E*3 -- +1 -- F3<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Although Marchettus focuses on thirds and sixths as unstable cadential<br/>&gt; intervals, the resolution from minor seventh to fifth occurs in<br/>&gt; various 13th-14th century styles. Like the progression from maximal<br/>&gt; sixth to octave, this intonational variation using 23/29 octave as a<br/>&gt; &quot;minimal seventh&quot; contracting to a fifth features motion by a<br/>&gt; whole-tone (five dieses) in one voice, and by a single cadential<br/>&gt; diesis in the other.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; In short, 29-tet is a temperament rich with many neo-medieval<br/>&gt; possibilities, ranging from the rather gently neo-Gothic to the<br/>&gt; adventurous ultra-Gothic. This isn&apos;t to exclude all the other uses of<br/>&gt; this tuning, only to offer a sketch of one very attractive side of its<br/>&gt; musical flavor.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Most respectfully,<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Margo Schulter<br/>&gt; <a href="mailto:mschulter@value.net">mschulter@value.net</a><br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; You do not need web access to participate.
