If I&apos;m wrong about that,<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; forgive me.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; And Monz responded:<br/>&gt; &gt; Yes, I did do it intentionally (didn&apos;t you read my analysis?).<br/>&gt;<br/>[David:]<br/>&gt; Sorry.  I hadn&apos;t yet read the whole thing, only the<br/>&gt; introductory paragraphs.  If I&apos;d had any idea you&apos;d taken<br/>&gt; such a radical [read: interesting] approach I would have read it all right away!<br/>&gt; :-)<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I have a feeling that you&apos;re on to something good in<br/>&gt; pursuing and advocating a lateral view through a JI<br/>&gt; framework.  In a way, that&apos;s combining the best of Medieval<br/>&gt; and Common Practice theory.  What I&apos;m not so sure about is<br/>&gt; compromising vertical sonority by a full syntonic comma<br/>&gt; (especially in a Common Practice era piece) for the sake of<br/>&gt; the individual part tunings.  I&apos;m also not sure that<br/>&gt; D#+:B+:F#+:B, or E:G:B+ constitute JI.  It certainly doesn&apos;t<br/>&gt; fit the usual definition of maximizing consonance.  It&apos;s<br/>&gt; unique, I&apos;ll give you that.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I thought at first hearing that most of the chords were out<br/>&gt; of tune with themselves, but when I slowed it way down, I<br/>&gt; could hear that they weren&apos;t after all, only 3 or 4 were.<br/>&gt; That was a disorienting discovery.  But then I found what<br/>&gt; was causing the misperception: the continual shoving of the<br/>&gt; comma into the listener&apos;s face.  The articulation of commas<br/>&gt; makes me uncomfortable.  Maybe it&apos;s simply that I&apos;m used to<br/>&gt; having it hidden in one way or another, and I could get<br/>&gt; comfortable with it in time, I don&apos;t know.  My intuition<br/>&gt; says, &quot;no way, buddy.&quot;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Well, it&apos;s an interesting experiment, and I&apos;m looking<br/>&gt; forward to hearing the whole piece when it&apos;s done.  It will<br/>&gt; be fun to see if it helps to hear more of it at once.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; David</p><p>P. S. Those of you who, like me, listened to the MIDI file<br/>but didn&apos;t read his full analysis, be assured that it&apos;s<br/>worth the read.  This is a boldly radical approach to<br/>rational tuning.<br/><a href="http://www.ixpres.com/interval/monzo/beethove/son9schz.htm">http://www.ixpres.com/interval/monzo/beethove/son9schz.htm</a></p></div><h3><a id=3558 href="#3558">ðŸ”—</a>monz@juno.com</h3><span>6/12/1999 7:30:49 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>[David J.

My intuition<br/>&gt; says, &quot;no way, buddy.&quot;</p><p>I think David brings up a good point here, since he and I have<br/>differing opinions on this matter of &apos;shoving the comma into<br/>the listener&apos;s face&apos;.</p><p>It could very well be that it doesn&apos;t bother me as much as it<br/>does him simply because I&apos;ve been playing around with this<br/>kind of thing (at least mentally) for several years.  Apparently<br/>I&apos;ve gotten used to the idea of chords being displaced by a<br/>comma; at any rate, I&apos;d never heard anything like this before<br/>- at least not with full knowledge of exactly what was going<br/>on harmonically/intonationally - and altho I hear the displacements<br/>too, it seems to me to work fine.</p><p>Ray Tomes has spoken a little about this idea of putting the<br/>comma shifts in stragegic &apos;breakpoints&apos; in the music.  I suppose<br/>that was what spurred me on to produce this experiment.</p><p>I agree that characterizing this experimental tuning as JI<br/>is *not* a good idea, at least not plain unqualified JI, for the<br/>reasons David pointed out.  It&apos;s probably unfortunate that<br/>many theorists and composers, including myself, have used<br/>&apos;just-intonation&apos; to mean these extended types of rational<br/>systems, since JI by definition already meant the usual 5-limit<br/>tuning which provides interlocking consonant 4:5:6 triads.<br/>Perhaps &apos;extended JI&apos; is a reasonable name, altho just<br/>calling it a &apos;5-limit rational tuning&apos; is probably best.</p><p>The thing I want to emphasize is that the tunings of the chords<br/>in this little fragment did not spring full-blown from my mind<br/>into the MIDI file.  They were arrived at thru lots of<br/>experimentation and changes in the tuning, with my ear as the<br/>guide all the way.  That&apos;s part of the reason it took so long<br/>to do just those 16 measures.</p><p>[David]<br/>&gt;  This is a boldly radical approach to rational tuning.</p><p>I always fantasized about being *some* kind of bold radical<br/>when I was a kid. Glad I found such a peaceful way to do it<br/>(assuming those comma shifts aren&apos;t causing too much harm).<br/>:)</p><p>-monz</p><p>Joseph L.
