They come from various<br/>sources I&apos;ve read, not least Chalmers on _Divisions<br/>of the Tetrachord_ and the Scala scale archives.</p><p>Here I should confess my mathematical naivete: I<br/>simply understand &quot;subgroup&quot; to mean a set of<br/>prime factors where not all possible primes smaller<br/>than the largest used are represented: e.g.<br/>2-3-7 out of 2-3-5-7. Since I take this kind of<br/>thing for granted in lots of JI systems or<br/>temperaments, I didn&apos;t have any special word for<br/>it, but your usage understood in this simple way<br/>is certainly logical and intuitive to me.</p><p>Thus to me the question is simply, &quot;Taking a given<br/>tetrachord or pentachord or octave-species or whatever,<br/>what prime factors are represented?&quot; For example:</p><p>     1/1     12/11    14/11    4/3<br/>        12:11      7:6    22:21</p><p>Here I&apos;d say that we have ratios formed by<br/>prime factors of 2, 3, 7, and 11. All I need is<br/>the tetrachord to see that we can form all of<br/>its ratios with these four primes, and need all<br/>four of these primes to form its ratios.</p><p>There are various ways this tetrachord might be<br/>used as part of a mode, and I should add the<br/>caution that Near Eastern modal systems are<br/>indeed built from tetrachords, not always<br/>resulting in strict octave reduplication, as<br/>one may note in a modern Maqam Bayyati or<br/>Shur Dastgah, both of which often feature<br/>a neutral third below the final but a minor<br/>sixth above it in the &quot;textbook&quot; form of<br/>the modal type.</p><p>For example, let&apos;s look at some possibilities<br/>for the above Hijaz tetrachord. One of these<br/>given in by Qutb al-Din would be to use it<br/>as an upper tetrachord above a Buzurg<br/>pentachord:</p><p>               Buzurg                  Hijaz<br/> |-------------------------------|-----------------|<br/>1/1  14/13  16/13  4/3   56/39  3/2  18/11  21/11 2/1<br/>  14:13   8:7  13:12 14:13 117:112 12:11 7:6  22:21</p><p>Combined, these tetrachords give us ratios based on<br/>primes 2-3-7-11-13. Here&apos;s another possibility which<br/>is rather like Qutb al-Din&apos;s Zankule mode:</p><p>         Rast              Hijaz          tone<br/> |-----------------|--------------------|     | 1/1   9/8  27/22  4/3   16/11   56/33 16/9   2/1<br/>   9:8  12:11 88:81  12:11   7:6   22:21  9:8</p><p>Here the factors for the whole octave, as for<br/>Hijaz alone, are 2-3-7-11. However, if one follows<br/>the 5-based ratios for Rast as given by Qutb al-Din<br/>(and still used in some Near Eastern traditions,<br/>notably the Ottoman), then we would have:</p><p>         Rast              Hijaz          9:8 tone<br/> |-----------------|--------------------|          | 1/1   9/8   5/4  4/3   16/11   56/33  16/9  40/21 2/1<br/>   9:8  10:9 16:15  12:11   7:6   22:21 15:14  21:20</p><p>Qutb al-Din&apos;s Zankule is thus not a subgroup but<br/>what you would call simply an &quot;11-limit&quot; tuning,<br/>if I&apos;m correct, i.e. 2-3-7-11.</p><p>Here are modern uses of a Hijaz tetrachord which do<br/>fit a subgroup concept as I understand it. First,<br/>as you observed, we could use the tetrachord<br/>disjunctly for one form of what is called<br/>Maqam Hijaz-Kar, here 2-3-7-11:</p><p> |-----------------------|       |--------------------|<br/>1/1   12/11    14/11    4/3     3/2   18/11   21/11  2/1<br/>  12:11     7:6    22:21    9:8   12:11    7:6   22:21</p><p>Another possibility is a form of Maqam Hijaz with a<br/>conjunct upper tetrachord of Rast:</p><p>           Hijaz                  Rast<br/> |-----------------------|--------------------| tone |<br/>1/1   12/11    14/11    4/3     3/2   18/11 16/9    2/1<br/>  12:11     7:6    22:21    9:8   12:11  88:81   9:8</p><p>This, again, would be 2-3-7-11.</p><p>A very helpful bit of advice in the maqam tradition is<br/>to &quot;follow the ajnas&quot; -- ajnas being the Arabic plural or<br/>jins or &quot;genus&quot; -- that is, to be aware of and be guided<br/>by one&apos;s progressions through the ajnas or genera of a<br/>given maqam, often trichords, tetrachords, or pentachords.<br/>These ajnas provide one guide in negotiating the _sayr_<br/>(Turkish _seyir_) or &quot;path&quot; of a given maqam, which often<br/>may involve expected tetrachord mutations or modulations.<br/>Thus I would say that for this music, jins-based concepts<br/>are vital; and writing about the Persian dastgah system,<br/>Hormoz Farhat warns that thinking in terms of octave scales<br/>can often be misleading as to the actual structure of<br/>the music.</p><p>With many thanks,</p><p>Margo<br/>mschulter@...</p></div><h3><a id=89273 href="#89273">ðŸ”—</a>genewardsmith &#x3C;genewardsmith@...&#x3E;</h3><span>5/16/2010 5:07:54 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;Carl Lumma&quot; &lt;carl@...&gt; wrote:</p><p>&gt; I don&apos;t pretend to understand the first thing about maqam music<br/>&gt; theory (talking about their practicing theory here, not the<br/>&gt; ethno-intonation stuff) but when I have looked into it, it has<br/>&gt; seemed that the proper lego block is the tetrachord.

Ozan, doubtless, might<br/>cite the very common interpretation of Maqam Rast<br/>in the Ottoman tradition as based on a tetrachord<br/>of 1/1 9/8 5/4 4/3, with Safi al-Din and Qutb al-Din<br/>giving these ratios in the epoch 1250-1300.</p><p>In the modern Persian and Turkish traditions, and<br/>likely also in some Arab styles, Maqam Hijaz or<br/>the corresponding Dastgah-e Chahargah typically<br/>uses a middle step around 7:6, rather different<br/>from 24-EDO, although the 250-cent step of that<br/>tuning is a possible variation.</p><p>Consider also this measured Hijaz intonation of<br/>the Turkish performer Kudsi Erguner, as reported<br/>by the Lebanese composer and scholar Amine Beyhom:</p><p>0     131    368    501<br/>   131    237    133</p><p>Actually this is quite close to the lower tetrachord<br/>of Buzurg as recorded by Qutb al-Din and Safi al-Din,<br/>two theorists whom I _would_ trust, albeit with an<br/>appreciation of the ambiguities and questions which<br/>do arise, as with most theorists:</p><p>1/1   14/13    16/13   4/3<br/> 0     128      359    498<br/>   14:13    8:7    13:12<br/>    128     231     139</p><p>Yes, Erguner&apos;s version of 131-237-133 -- and this<br/>fluctuates a bit, not so surprisingly, during his<br/>performance -- is a bit different than 128-231-139,<br/>but a lot closer to that than to 150-200-150, for<br/>example. If we want for some reason a 12n-EDO<br/>approximation, how about 36-EDO: 133-233-133?</p><p>While we don&apos;t have recordings from the 8th-13th<br/>centuries to test what the theorists of that era<br/>report, a lot of it seems intuitively very credible,<br/>especially in view of what is being advocated,<br/>documented, and measured among Near Eastern musicians<br/>today.</p><p>Thus al-Farabi&apos;s version of Zalzal&apos;s &grave;oud or lute<br/>tuning seems to me a quite reasonable approximation<br/>of the kind of Rast which might be played in Egypt;<br/>as you have noted, Ozan, the third step Segah<br/>(or Sikah in Arabic), which al-Farabi places at 27/22,<br/>will typically be rather higher as one hears the maqam<br/>in parts more to the east such as Palestine, Syria, and<br/>Turkey: maybe around 21/17 or 26/21, and in the<br/>Ottoman tradition often around 5/4.</p><p>Likewise, Ibn Sina&apos;s placement of Zalzal&apos;s wusta or<br/>neutral third fret considerably lower at 39/32 may<br/>reflect a preference still present in much Persian<br/>music today for a small neutral third, for example<br/>in Dastgah-e Segah, where Hormoz Farhat, averaging<br/>some tar tunings, places this step at about 340 cents<br/>above the note representing the final of a mode<br/>like Ibn Sina&apos;s (in Dastgah-e Segah, the third step<br/>is now regarded as the final).</p><p>Carl, while a ratio like 81:68 (the wusta Fers or<br/>&quot;Persian middle finger&quot; of medieval theory) might<br/>seem rather complex, on a fretboard a medieval<br/>or modern musician can make an arithmetic division<br/>of 9:8 into 18:17:16, so we have a 9:8 step plus<br/>this division of another 9:8 tone, here shown in<br/>string ratios:</p><p>     81       72     68    64<br/>    1/1      9/8   81/68   4/3<br/>         9:8    18:17   17:16</p><p>In fact, nuances such as distinctions in the placement<br/>of smaller and larger neutral seconds are a concern<br/>of traditional performers which tend to get lost in<br/>the teaching of some Egyptian conservatories, for<br/>example, that 24-EDO is an adequate model.</p><p>Best,</p><p>Margo</p></div><h3><a id=89275 href="#89275">ðŸ”—</a>genewardsmith &#x3C;genewardsmith@...&#x3E;</h3><span>5/16/2010 5:48:31 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;Carl Lumma&quot; &lt;carl@...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; One common mistake in ethnomusicology -- and doubly in ancient<br/>&gt; ethnomusicology -- is trusting the theorists.</p><p>Let&apos;s go by performance practice in ancient Greece and the medieval Islamic world instead.
