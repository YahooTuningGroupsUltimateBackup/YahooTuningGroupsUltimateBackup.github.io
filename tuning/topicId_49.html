A<br/>larger number of 2-manual regular scalatrons were also sold, but, alas,<br/>not enough for Motorola to continue supporting it. Also, the inventor,<br/>George Harasek, is now deceased.</p><p>Erv Wilson collaborated with Secor on the keyboard, which is basically a<br/>12- column Bosanguet pattern.</p><p>Tom Reed, who now runs the Music Notation Modernization Association,<br/>promoted the von Janko and other new keyboards in his journal Muzika 6-6<br/>Bulteno, in English and Esperanto. He&apos;d likely to be a good source for<br/>more information on keyboard design as well as new notations, mostly for<br/>12-tone music.</p><p>Doug Keislar is also associated with the MNMA.</p><p>As for the Lambdoma, I don&apos;t think the modern form can be traced farther<br/>back than to Albert (Adalbert?) von Thimus in the 19th Century (and Hans<br/>Kayser,  more recently). Plato&apos;s Lambdoma was a numerical explication of<br/>the division of the World Soul by squares and cubes of 2 and 3, though<br/>IIRC, one can derive the Dorian diatonic mode in Pythagorean tuning from<br/>the array of numbers.</p><p>Whatever one might make of Kayer, von Thimus, McLain, et al.&apos;s tables<br/>and charts, they have a certain fascination that IMHO can serve to<br/>inspire new music.</p><p>BTW, does anyone know how to temporarily suspend mail delivery from<br/>onelist. I may be away for 2-3 weeks this winter and would like to be<br/>able to get the back Digests when I return.</p><p>--John</p></div><h3><a id=51 href="#51">ðŸ”—</a>Mark Nowitzky &#x3C;nowitzky@xxxx.xxx.xxxx&#x3E;</h3><span>12/31/1998 11:49:38 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Hi John (and Happy New Year everyone!),</p><p>At 10:57 AM 12/31/98 +0000, John Chalmers &lt;<a href="mailto:jhchalmers@UCSD.Edu">jhchalmers@UCSD.Edu</a>&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;BTW, does anyone know how to temporarily suspend mail delivery from<br/>&gt;onelist.

I&apos;ve never used it, but here&apos;s<br/>what ONElist&apos;s web site says about it:</p><p>  The No Mail option is useful if you are going on vacation and<br/>  don&apos;t want emails to pile up while you are gone.  By clicking on<br/>  the Set No Mail link in the User Center, you will turn off mail<br/>  delivery for that list.  Mail will not be saved while you are<br/>  not receiving email.</p><p>When you get back, you can go to the &quot;Archives&quot; option to get the old<br/>digests.  (And don&apos;t forget to turn the Mail option back on.)</p><p>Have a good vacation or whatever!</p><p>--Mark<br/>+------------------------------------------------------+<br/>| Mark Nowitzky                                        |<br/>| email:  <a href="mailto:nowitzky@alum.mit.edu">nowitzky@alum.mit.edu</a>    AIM:  Nowitzky      |<br/>| www:    <a href="http://www.pacificnet.net/~nowitzky">http://www.pacificnet.net/~nowitzky</a>          |<br/>|         &quot;If you haven&apos;t visited Mark Nowitzky&apos;s home |<br/>|         page recently, you haven&apos;t missed much...&quot;   |<br/>+------------------------------------------------------+</p></div>
