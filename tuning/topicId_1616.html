Won&apos;t the violin also have the 1800 and 1764 partials?</p><p>Sure, but they are further out and would likely be lower in amplitude and<br/>hence contribute less to the beating (by stating the example as I did, I was<br/>implicitely assuming equal amplitudes for each of the first five partials, and<br/>nothing beyond that - obviously an oversimplification). What we really<br/>should do is pick the spectrum precisely, and then calculate the sensory<br/>dissonance - I was trying to give a simple explanation of why the effect<br/>might occur with carinetish vs violinish timbres. The actual sensory<br/>dissonance will inevitably depend on the specifics of the timbre.</p><p>&gt;2. Tuning the clarinets in this register to a 5:4 would only speed up<br/>&gt;the beating, lowering the roughness only slightly. Tuning them to a 9:7,<br/>&gt;however, would eliminate the beating entirely. So is a 9:7 more<br/>&gt;consonant than a 5:4 for low clarinets? (Gary, you made the original<br/>&gt;comment, so tell us what you think.)</p><p>By playing with the exact tuning relationships and the exact timbres, you<br/>should be able to get just about any ordering you can think of. This kind of<br/>example highlights the danger of divorcing &quot;consonance&quot; calculations from<br/>the timbre/spectrum of the sounds involved.</p></div>
