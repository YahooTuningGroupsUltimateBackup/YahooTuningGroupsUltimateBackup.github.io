The idea occurred to me when I was listening to some music by Frescobaldi played in meantone. I don&apos;t know anything in particular about the person who performed the piece nor about the harpsichord that was used for the recording I have. I simply think that the tempering is a bit stronger than 1/4-comma meantone (like 2/7-comma or something similar) and I was just curious if there could be a way to see if I was right -- perhaps with some software analysis? If you wish to know something more about the recording, I&apos;ll ask my classmate. She&apos;s sent it to me essentially just because she knew I was a great fan of meantone tunings. I&apos;ll let you hear it at least: <a href="http://download.yousendit.com/F9282B783DCD1EB7">http://download.yousendit.com/F9282B783DCD1EB7</a></p><p>Petr</p></div>
