I saw (for the first time) a Baritone guitar at GC when I bought<br/>my 5 string bass a couple months ago. That type of instrument - with a lot<br/>longer neck then usual may actually be sensible for high number edos. Or<br/>perhaps convert a bass with 6 or more string guitar hardware.</p><p>Thanks  on the 19 - I&apos;m looking forward to getting the new axe. It is a nice<br/>gloss black Ibenez this time with 2 humbuckers and whammy bar. I got it for<br/>under $100 and it played beautifully - especially for the price range.
