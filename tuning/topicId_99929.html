June 11th, 2011</p><p>Hello -</p><p>&#x9;I used to be active posting to the Tuning List about 10 years ago but have since then gotten to being much less active, and have contributed posts much less frequently.</p><p>&#x9;However I&apos;ve been developing a fairly specific system for organizing the pitch/harmonic side of music one is studying or composing which I believe has value and deserves the attention of musicians (composers, teachers, music lovers).</p><p>&#x9;I&apos;d like to get my thoughts on this out where they can be read, accompanying the verbal material with audio tracks demonstrating what the system covers with sound and music which can be listened to and thought about.  The medium of posts to Tuning coupled with audio material put out on You Tube might work as a way enabling me to do this - at least to get a first draft treatise coupled with the needed audio examples out to others interested in this where they can both benefit right away from getting the information and give me feedback I can use to improve my whole presentation into a form which gets the full degree of attention from musicians and teachers of musicians of all kinds - composers, performers, music lovers and involved facilitators, music schools and university music departments ... - it potentially merits.</p><p>&#x9;Would a series of posts to Tuning which forms a draft of a systematic plan for organizing musical pitch and harmony be something seen by Tuning List members as a worthwhile contribution published in an appropriate venue?</p><p>&#x9;I&apos;d seek to present my materials in a coherent interesting and understandable way.  However getting things in the right order consistently and completely avoiding awkwardnesses and/or gaps in my explanations and examples could prove to be sometimes a little beyond my reach.  There might also be suggestions made to me which I didn&apos;t follow up on after considering them in the light of &quot;the whole ball of wax&quot; I was dealing with.  I would not want to be rude or unappreciative at all, but I expect I may find myself struggling to get done a core minimum of things which absolutely had to be done with scarcely any time left for following up on things I didn&apos;t believe fell into the &quot;absolutely must do correctly&quot; category.</p><p>&#x9;I hope some will give me the benefit of their thoughts as to the suitability of my getting a draft of my thoughts on an organized way of thinking about musical pitch/harmony which could form a replacement (or core of a replacement) for the current compound of common practice quarter comma mean tone systematization confusingly subposed beneath the 12 equal pitch step per octave 20th century piano tuning system which makes no distinction (the latter) between the 24/25 frequency ratio chromatic semitone (eg E-flat to E) and the 15/16 frequency ratio diatonic semitone found in the step E to F.  Think of the melody starting on C for &quot;I&apos;m dreaming of a White Christmas&quot; - the upward step between the 1st and 2nd note of the melody (diatonic semitone) and the downward step between the 3rd and 4th notes of the melody (or upward again between the 4th and 5th notes of the melody).</p><p>&#x9;Best wishes, Ralph David Hill</p></div><h3>Chris Vaisvil &#x3C;chrisvaisvil@...&#x3E;</h3><span>6/12/2011 3:46:26 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Hi Ralph,</p><p>I have serious doubts this is a proper venue.</p><p>The posters here are much more likely to talk about Carl Lumma&apos;s sex life<br/>than anything else.</p><p>Chris</p><p>On Sun, Jun 12, 2011 at 1:04 AM, Ralph Hill &lt;ASCEND11@...&gt; wrote:</p><p>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Sending 10:00 PM PDT Sat.
