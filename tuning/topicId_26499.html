I&apos;ll take a short stab at your bell<br/>&gt;questions. I&apos;ve spent 23 years making bronze<br/>&gt;gongs, and used oxygen tank bells at Mills College<br/>&gt;playing music of Paul Schaleger</p><p>1) Which tone in a bell is the one that our minds select to be the<br/>bell&apos;s pitch?</p><p>&gt; the tone that sustains.  use padded sticks or rubber<br/>&gt; hammers to experiment and find the tone.</p><p>2) Does anyone have any good ideas on how to measure these tones?</p><p>&gt; the guy who commented on Risset had the right idea: you<br/>&gt; would benefit from an FFT analysis, and there are some<br/>&gt; easy-to-use for small computers.  you need to get<br/>&gt; the waveform up on a display and look at it.<br/>&gt; Best would be make a tape or loop the sound (record it)<br/>&gt; and use a software analyser to find the frequencies.</p><p>&gt; the wav prog for church bells can give you a hard<br/>&gt; time because the shape of your tank bells is<br/>&gt; different - right, so the classic western bell<br/>&gt; shape and harmonic series will not apply.</p><p>Richard A.

Have you tried looking at the wave form?</p><p>It&apos;s a very fast saw tooth or triangular wave superimposed on a basically sinusoidal waveform.</p><p>Most intruiging!</p><p>I&apos;m in the middle of adding an option to my freeware / shareware program FTS to find<br/>the FFT for sections of a waveform, which you select using left and rt click.</p><p>You can also remake the wave from the partials as sine waves and hear what it sounds like, as in the<br/>WAVANAL program.</p><p>I&apos;ve added options for FFT peak interpolation between the bin sizes, which will<br/>usually give a closer estimate of the frequency than you get with WAVANAL.</p><p>Perhaps you&apos;ll find it helpful once it is done?</p><p>More anon.</p><p>Robert</p></div><h3>Robert Walker &#x3C;robertwalker@ntlworld.com&#x3E;</h3><span>7/27/2001 5:44:59 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Hi Flint,</p><p>&gt; It&apos;s a very fast saw tooth or triangular wave superimposed on a basically<br/>&gt; sinusoidal waveform.</p><p>Sorry, tried opening it in other sound programs and it is showing up as<br/>a normal wave form without the zig zags.</p><p>Obviously need to do some more work on the wave file reading side of my program<br/>(new feature).</p><p>Robert</p></div>
