It&apos;s quite an undertaking; increased<br/>thanks to Dave Madole for managing it for all that time!</p><p>Anyway, here&apos;s some common problems, and how to deal with them.</p><p>1)  Too many messages per day - I want just one, daily email:</p><p>For those of you who preferred receiving the list in one, daily &quot;digest&quot; (as<br/>I do), you<br/>need to switch your subscription to digest mode, by sending an empty email<br/>to &quot;<a href="mailto:tuning-digest@onelist.com">tuning-digest@onelist.com</a>&quot;.</p><p>It&apos;s too bad I wasn&apos;t able to capture everybody&apos;s &quot;digest vs. non-digest&quot;<br/>preferences from the old system, &apos;cuz it seems to be a common problem.</p><p>2)  &quot;When I try to switch to digest, or even mail to the list at all, I am<br/>told that my email address is not subscribed.  And yet I receive tuning<br/>email here.&quot;:</p><p>You may be known to the system by a different email address.  The difference<br/>may be subtle, or there may be some sort of &quot;email forwarding&quot; going on.<br/>Compare the return address you put on emails to the address ONElist is using<br/>to send you mail.</p><p>3)  Do I have to have web access to use this thing now?</p><p>No.  I saw this problem coming.  That&apos;s why I included this extra<br/>description in every message, after ONElist&apos;s web instructions:</p><p>  You do not need web access to participate.  You may subscribe through<br/>  email.  Send an empty email to one of these addresses:<br/>    <a href="mailto:tuning-subscribe@onelist.com">tuning-subscribe@onelist.com</a> - subscribe to the tuning list.<br/>    <a href="mailto:tuning-unsubscribe@onelist.com">tuning-unsubscribe@onelist.com</a> - unsubscribe from the tuning list.<br/>    <a href="mailto:tuning-digest@onelist.com">tuning-digest@onelist.com</a> - switch your subscription to digest mode.<br/>    <a href="mailto:tuning-normal@onelist.com">tuning-normal@onelist.com</a> - switch your subscription to normal mode.</p><p>That&apos;s all for now.  Go back to talking about tuning.  (Maybe I&apos;ll join in<br/>on that again too, once the smoke settles.)  Thanks,</p><p>--Mark<br/>+------------------------------------------------------+<br/>| Mark Nowitzky                                        |<br/>| email:  <a href="mailto:nowitzky@alum.mit.edu">nowitzky@alum.mit.edu</a>    AIM:  Nowitzky      |<br/>| www:    <a href="http://www.pacificnet.net/~nowitzky">http://www.pacificnet.net/~nowitzky</a>          |<br/>|         &quot;If you haven&apos;t visited Mark Nowitzky&apos;s home |<br/>|         page recently, you haven&apos;t missed much...&quot;   |<br/>+------------------------------------------------------+</p></div>
