Typical 13th-century discussions of polyphony list a<br/>set of 13, counting the _tritonus_ but not the distinct _semitritonus_<br/>of Jacobus.</p><p>This confirms a point you make, Monz: the term &quot;tritone&quot; is routine in<br/>a medieval European setting where Pythagorean intonation is the norm,<br/>with this interval equal to three 9:8 whole-tones.</p><p>In the Renaissance, by the time of Vicentino (1555) and Zarlino<br/>(1558), the use of the diminished fifth in progressions by stepwise<br/>contrary motion to a major third is standard in theory as well as<br/>practice, and Zarlino notes that the older composers as well as the<br/>&quot;moderns&quot; do this -- possibly referring, for example, to the<br/>generation of Josquin des Prez around 1500. Such resolutions are<br/>important in 16th-century style, and become a feature of late<br/>17th-century tonality also.</p><p>For more on this, please see</p><p><a href="http://www.medieval.org/emfaq/harmony/tritone.html">http://www.medieval.org/emfaq/harmony/tritone.html</a></p><p>Here I might add that 13th-14th century cadences seem to me just as<br/>compelling as 18th-century cadences: each language has its own<br/>beauty. Paul Erlich&apos;s theory of &quot;strong&quot; or &quot;tonal&quot; progressions, by<br/>the way, nicely covers both types of progressions, and seems correctly<br/>to predict the strongest 14th-century progressions.</p><p>Gerry, while noting that the tritone gets used in medieval music, I&apos;d<br/>much agree that it takes on a more central role in the Renaissance,<br/>and yet more so in 18th-19th century tonality. The explanation I might<br/>offer is simply that the most compelling progressions in composed<br/>European music often seem to involve resolutions from an unstable to a<br/>stable interval by stepwise contrary motion.</p><p>In a Gothic or neo-Gothic setting, this means such expanding<br/>resolutions as major third to fifth, major sixth to octave, and major<br/>second to fourth, for example; or contracting ones such as minor third<br/>to unison and minor seventh to fifth.</p><p>Curiously, my rationale for often leaning toward ratios of 7 for these<br/>intervals (9:7, 12:7, 8:7; 7:6, 7:4) is that cadences become more<br/>efficient, with less motion needed to reach the stable goal. This is<br/>hardly original: a medieval theorist such as Marchettus of Padua<br/>(1318) refers to it as &quot;closest approach.&quot;</p><p>On one level, this means that thirds expanding to fifths or sixths to<br/>octaves should be major -- with accidental inflections, if needed. To<br/>Marchettus, it additionally means that these cadential major thirds<br/>and sixths should be extra-wide, so as more closely to &quot;approach&quot; the<br/>interval of resolution, the fifth or octave.</p><p>Thus in various neo-medieval tuning systems, I might use a regular<br/>major third around the Pythagorean 81:64 (~407.82 cents) or 14:11<br/>(~417.51 cents), for example, but a larger major third around 9:7<br/>(435.08 cents) for such cadential progressions to a fifth.</p><p>What happens around the late 15th century is that major and minor<br/>thirds become increasingly stable intervals -- a change in musical<br/>style accompanied by an intonational shift toward meantone temperament<br/>on keyboards, and likely by vocal ensembles toward some kind of<br/>meantone-like or adaptive 5-limit JI tuning.</p><p>In such a style, the diminished fifth can contract to a major third,<br/>or an augmented fourth or tritone expand to a minor sixth, very<br/>efficiently -- and reach a stable goal.</p><p>The open question, however, is how important &quot;closest approach&quot; at the<br/>level of fine tuning would be to 16th-century ensembles. Curiously,<br/>Vicentino (1555) has some &quot;enharmonic&quot; cadences in his 31-note<br/>meantone system using the step of a chromatic semitone (2/5-tone in<br/>this system) rather than the usual diatonic semitone (3/5-tone). This<br/>seems more a special effect than an emulation of vocal intonation,<br/>although we can hardly exclude the possibility that something similar<br/>sometimes happened in performance. Vicentino&apos;s cadence calls for a<br/>shift by a diesis (about 128:125 or ~41.06 cents), which is a main<br/>point of the progression as one facet of his effort to adapt &quot;ancient<br/>theory&quot; to &quot;modern practice&quot; -- the polyphonic use of the Greek<br/>chromatic and enharmonic genera.</p><p>Zarlino (1558) tells us that vocal ensembles strive toward pure<br/>5-based ratios (those included in the _senario_ of natural numbers<br/>from 1 to 6, plus the 8:5 minor sixth), and can make adjustments to<br/>avoid complications of the syntonic diatonic such as 40:27 fifths.<br/>However, to my best knowledge, he does not address the use of smaller<br/>cadential semitones than the 16:15 (~111.73 cents) of Ptolemy&apos;s<br/>syntonic diatonic.</p><p>A final, personal, note on the tritone: I &quot;discovered&quot; it in 1966, on<br/>the piano in the classroom where my Music Appreciation course was<br/>taught, when I was delightedly playing parallel fourths or fifths and<br/>suddenly ran into an &quot;out of tune&quot; interval. I suggested to someone<br/>that the instrument must be out of tune, and was helpfully informed<br/>that I had hit a tritone, B-F, quite distinct from my desired perfect<br/>fifth.</p><p>In this kind of musical context, a tritone can be a very obtrusive<br/>&quot;Wolf,&quot; which could explain the eager desires -- not only mine, but<br/>those of some medieval clerics -- to avoid its unintended appearance.</p><p>By around 1200, however, Perotin uses the tritone as well as the minor<br/>second or major seventh -- all &quot;perfect&quot; or acute discords in this era<br/>-- to beautiful effect. In a style with a continual mix of stable and<br/>unstable sonorities, it helps diversify the continuum.</p><p>In this kind of style, the tritone or diminished fifth often behaves<br/>much like a usual fourth or fifth, resolving by parallel or similar<br/>motion to a stable fourth or fifth. I like this effect very much<br/>either in the historically accurate Pythagorean tuning, or in a range<br/>of systems such as 29-EDO, 46-EDO, and indeed 20-EDO (where the<br/>&quot;diminished fifth&quot; in my quasi-diatonic modes is 540 cents).</p><p>Anyway, while I can say that the Renaissance use of the tritone as an<br/>interval resolving to a stable third by stepwise contrary motion<br/>developed in a meantone type of keyboard orientation, just how singers<br/>or other flexible-pitch performers negotiated these progressions<br/>remains an open question.</p><p>Most appreciatively,</p><p>Margo Schulter<br/><a href="mailto:mschulter@value.net">mschulter@value.net</a></p></div><h3><a id=34185 href="#34185">ðŸ”—</a>Gerald Eskelin &#x3C;stg3music@earthlink.net&#x3E;</h3><span>2/13/2002 6:36:12 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>On 2/13/02 1:54 PM, &quot;<a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>&quot; &lt;<a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>&gt; wrote:</p><p>&gt;<br/>&gt; Message: 7<br/>&gt;  Date: Wed, 13 Feb 2002 09:22:09 -0800 (PST)<br/>&gt;  From: &quot;M.

I feel I&apos;m growing like a teenager when I read your<br/>eloquent discourse. In fact, the prose is often so beautiful in itself that<br/>I&apos;m temporarily distracted from your meaning and have to read it again. :-)<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; A final, personal, note on the tritone: I &quot;discovered&quot; it in 1966, on<br/>&gt; the piano in the classroom where my Music Appreciation course was<br/>&gt; taught, when I was delightedly playing parallel fourths or fifths and<br/>&gt; suddenly ran into an &quot;out of tune&quot; interval.

That is precisely how I demonstrate the uniqueness (and<br/>importance) of the tritone to my students, as well as any readers of Music<br/>101 text &quot;The Sounds of Music: Perception and Notation.&quot; I&apos;m experiencing<br/>goosebumps to see that this exercise was important in your formative past.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; In this kind of musical context, a tritone can be a very obtrusive<br/>&gt; &quot;Wolf,&quot; which could explain the eager desires -- not only mine, but<br/>&gt; those of some medieval clerics -- to avoid its unintended appearance.</p><p>And this amplifies my point--that 17th century composers, having discovered<br/>the strength of the tritone, used it *intentionally* to effect their<br/>kaleidoscopic modulations.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; By around 1200, however, Perotin uses the tritone as well as the minor<br/>&gt; second or major seventh -- all &quot;perfect&quot; or acute discords in this era<br/>&gt; -- to beautiful effect.

All we have now is the report of what<br/>musicians *thought* they were doing. As we know from Paul&apos;s responses to my<br/>own posts of what I *think* I&apos;m doing, we have to be careful that we don&apos;t<br/>take the word of the medieval &quot;Gerald Eskelins&quot; as to what they were<br/>actually hearing. :-)<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Anyway, while I can say that the Renaissance use of the tritone as an<br/>&gt; interval resolving to a stable third by stepwise contrary motion<br/>&gt; developed in a meantone type of keyboard orientation, just how singers<br/>&gt; or other flexible-pitch performers negotiated these progressions<br/>&gt; remains an open question.</p><p>Again, wouldn&apos;t it have been great to have been there.</p><p>But in any case, isn&apos;t it reasonable to suppose that the physical functions<br/>of medieval ears were pretty much the same as our own? I have to believe<br/>that cultural influences don&apos;t affect the perception of &quot;pure&quot; acoustic<br/>tonal relations differently today than in any previous time.
