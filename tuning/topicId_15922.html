Odd limit = 13.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; Yep.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt;  But, no, it&apos;s arbitrary.<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; It&apos;s meaningless as a set of Just ratios.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; Only because you can&apos;t find a pattern. But there IS a pattern in<br/>&gt; &gt; this collection of numbers. Ratios.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; The fact that they&apos;re all ratios is a common characteristic, not a<br/>&gt; pattern.  To put it another way, is it possible to construct a<br/>&gt; logical tuning system that would yield this as a complete set?  It<br/>&gt; can&apos;t be proven that it isn&apos;t because that&apos;s a universal negative.<br/>&gt; But it seems highly unlikely to me.  I chose them arbitrarily.<br/>&gt; Well, not quite - I chose to list 7 items, and specifically excluded<br/>&gt; choices that would tend to result in anything resembling a<br/>&gt; recognizable scale.  That&apos;s harder to do than it sounds, a testimony<br/>&gt; to the inherent musical vigor of low-ratio JI.  Once you concoct a<br/>&gt; set like this, though, what you&apos;ve got is a &quot;tuning&quot; that is almost<br/>&gt; inevitably going to yield &quot;music&quot; that is little more than a jumble<br/>&gt; of meaningless tones, provided that the style of music is one in<br/>&gt; which musical interest relies on tonal relationships.</p><p>Meaningless?
