We have his fantasy<br/>66 in something completely new on the next recording.</p><p>Inre Beethoven:<br/>&gt;&gt;that he used so many extreme changes of key in</p><p>his modulations (meaning that the two keys are quite far</p><p>removed in the circle-of-5ths, or that he often preferred</p><p>mediant/submediant relationships rather than perfect-4th/5th</p><p>relationships in the root movement), which implies to me a</p><p>tendency toward much freer use of all 12 notes, which in</p><p>turn implies a tendency towards equalizing the relationships</p><p>between those notes.&lt;&lt;</p><p>     That the use of all twelve notes implies a tendency towards equalizing<br/>the relationships between them loses me, a bit.  A different musical logic,<br/>perhaps?   Once equalized, a large degree of contrast in the harmony is lost,<br/>(the use of &quot;key character&quot;, as I posted earlier).</p><p>&gt;&gt;Perhaps it&apos;s more accurate to suggest that while Beethoven</p><p>himself may have always thought in terms of well-temperament</p><p>&lt;snip&lt; the new harmonic techniques he introduced encouraged composers after</p><p>him to view the 12 notes of the chromatic scale as needing to</p><p>have the equalized relationships of 12-tET.&lt;&lt;</p><p>    Perhaps, though he may have actually begun his life by thinking in<br/>meantone, and the continuing refinement of the well-tempered approach (which<br/>occurred at least through Young&apos;s presentation to the Royal Society in 1799),<br/>gave him continually increasing access to the more remote keys, the pursuit<br/>of which he seemed to be in the forefront.<br/>      The consideration of the syntonic comma as the acceptable limit for a<br/>third seems to have been formed as early as Werckmeister(1690).  This was<br/>pre-piano, so organs and harpsichords were the instruments to which this<br/>limit applied. The earliest Cristofori pianos were , from a string tension<br/>perspective, little more than harpsichords.<br/>     As the piano rapidly became more tightly strung and string tension<br/>rose,( over the span fom 1730-1850, string tension rose from 3,000 lbs to<br/>30,000 lbs!), the resulting tonal harshness of the syn. comma may have been<br/>increasingly avoided, leading to the tempering evolution we see during this<br/>period.  Music was also evolving rather rapidly at this time, so while the<br/>increasing tension was a result of musicians wanting more power, the spectra<br/>was altered by doing so and may have affected the composers tastes. So what<br/>we got here is a scramble of eggs and chickens.<br/>      Was there a move by instrument builders to keep all the keys<br/>accessible, and did they do this by encouraging the use of more ameliorating<br/>tempering?  And did the composers leap on the increased smoothness of<br/>modulation which this offered?  Is this why there was more musical usage to<br/>all twelve keys that occurred between the WTC and Chopin? Seems logical to<br/>me, and it once again puts Beethoven in the middle of two eras, the meantone<br/>and the ET.  He seems to be constantly portrayed as standing with one foot<br/>somewhere in time and the other in another, I wonder that he isn&apos;t more often<br/>ripped. (and now another foote to spread the analogies wider, yet)</p><p>&gt;&gt;Perhaps I&apos;m just wildly speculating again... but hey, it&apos;s</p><p>food for thought. &lt;&lt;<br/>    It is great food for thought, that is why this list is such a banquet,<br/>and I really appreciate finding others that want to dig as deeply into the<br/>dish, (or dish as deeply into the dig!)</p><p>&gt;&gt;Future researchers may jump on ideas like this as subjects for<br/>dissertations; then we can really get to the bottom of it.&lt;&lt;</p><p>   Yes,  I hope so, that is a major thrust of my efforts.  I would like to<br/>find out if there is a &quot;Beethoven Code&quot;.  Bill Sethares has the raw data from<br/>some experiments we did here in Nashville several years ago.  We used a<br/>Yamaha reproducer grand piano, upon which Enid Katahn played and recorded<br/>several pieces.  We then let the piano replay them with a variety of tunings<br/>on it, one of which was equal, the others well tempered.  Bill&apos;s dissonance<br/>measuring program was to look at the resulting dissonance &quot;scores&quot; and see if<br/>the change from ET to WT created a cohesive pattern, a &quot;code&quot; of subliminal<br/>emotional manipulations.   Ooooh,  if there really was a secret code in<br/>there, we could shake the ivory towers as badly as McClaren has always<br/>dreamed of!</p><p>        &quot;You say you want a revolution?   Damn right!  At least, I do. I<br/>admit, I may still be lost in the &apos;60&apos;s, but I can think of nothing more<br/>re-invigorating for the classical music world, or eye-opening for the<br/>composers of today and tomorrow.  Dissonance/consonance created<br/>stimulative/sedative control is to music what architectural balance and<br/>texture is to the eye. (Bauhaus sterility or Schoenberg&apos;s intellectual music<br/>notwithstanding {small glowing ember there, I realize......})</p><p>Inre my posting:</p><p>&gt;      When Beethoven modulates  &lt;snippppppppppppppppp&gt;</p><p>Monz asks:<br/>&gt;&gt;My question: why in the world did you not include detailed</p><p>technical commentary like this in the booklet accompanying</p><p>the CD? &lt;&lt;</p><p>    Well, if I had, my record company president would have been found hanging<br/>from a rafter!  I overloaded them, as it was.   I was trying to create an<br/>overview of the historical inaccuracy and emotional cost of ET and perhaps<br/>concentrated on the technical/historical perspective at the expense of the<br/>sensual.<br/>     Please forgive me a little, I am a craftsman with an idea, not a<br/>musicologically educated orator.  That was my first attempt at publishing<br/>something, and like the first Marines on the beach,  mistakes were made.  My<br/>second assault is in the works, and I can post the liner notes from &quot;Six<br/>Degrees&quot; here if you like.  The major critique I got from the Beethoven liner<br/>notes was that it was too complex and detailed for public consumption.  The<br/>&quot;Tuning&quot; list members are far more able to understand the principles<br/>involved.</p><p> Joseph writes:</p><p>&gt;&gt;And this is why I clock in with my</p><p>&gt;protests of adaptive retuning as espoused by John deLaubenfels</p><p>despite the fact that I think it&apos;s a brilliant bit of problem solving</p><p>given a particular approach. But to my mind that approach is a tuning</p><p>first, music second one that immediately lops off a huge array of</p><p>fascinating and emotionally rich horizons by way of an overriding</p><p>(tuning) assumption; all thirds = 5/4 = good, for example...&gt;</p><p>      I believe that hearing music with the dissonance removed can be a<br/>valuable course.  It may be what composers were dreaming of, and wished for<br/>in the meantone era.  This assumes that the dissonance was truly viewed as<br/>&quot;the imperfection&quot; of the instrument.  There is no doubt in my mind that if<br/>John&apos;s adaptive (re) tuning had been able to have been manifested 300 years<br/>ago, music composition, as we know it, would have followed a very different<br/>course.  Many attempts were made, (Vincentio, Liston, etal),  but the<br/>physical demands pushed them beyond the point of diminishing returns.  These<br/>experimental searches for pure tonality came and went long ago.<br/>     The sounds are still in the musical gene pool, though, and there is<br/>still hope today, for as Margo dances among her twin keyboards, all these<br/>heretofore dreamed of combinations are swimming into view.  (And I would like<br/>to go on record as saying her work has had profound effects on how I view<br/>musical history already!)<br/>     Plutarch stated that &quot;Music, to create harmony, must investigate<br/>discord&quot;.  This may mean compositional discord, or tuning discord, I don&apos;t<br/>know.  It does sound like the &quot;tight shoe theory&quot;, but possibly offers us yet<br/>another perspective, and I firmly believe that the more perspectives we have<br/>experienced, the more valid our observations on everything.  So much of what<br/>we do, and how intensely we do it, is a function of our past experiences:<br/>like the Crusades, if you had been eating unflavored gruel for 12 centuries,<br/>you would gladly kill someone for a handful of pepper!</p><p>Monz also writes:<br/>&gt;&gt;  Ed is trying to present Beethoven&apos;s</p><p>music the way it would have been *heard* on a piano during</p><p>Beethoven&apos;s lifetime.  John is trying to present it the way</p><p>it might have been *imagined* in Beethoven&apos;s mind.  I&apos;d say</p><p>that there&apos;s a subtle intimate link there.&lt;&lt;</p><p>     Links are good.  I look for them, and am happy to think we may have one<br/>here.  It is pretty subtle to me, but much is.<br/>   A small distinction I would like to suggest, inre &quot;Beethoven&apos;s music the<br/>way it would have been *heard* on a piano during Beethoven&apos;s lifetime&quot;.    In<br/>order to hear it as it sounded in his lifetime,  we must have not only the<br/>instruments of those days, but we would need the audiences of his era, and<br/>today&apos;s hearts and ears are not conditioned to be that receptive to emotional<br/>stimuli.  We are saturated with music that is trying to sell us something,<br/>sounds that have manipulating our spending habits as their purpose.<br/>    Today there are large halls, with large pianos in front of audiences that<br/>treat the musical experience as an intellectual/social/political event.<br/>Restoring the temperament to the music is my way of trying to restore an<br/>emotional respite to the listener.  My two most gratifying responses in the<br/>last 6 years have been seeing people in the audience cry during the<br/>Pathetique&apos;s middle section, and having listeners tell me that our Beethoven<br/>CD is the one recording that they play only when they have enough time to sit<br/>and listen to a complete sonata,  that it is not &quot;background&quot; music for their<br/>activity, but rather, listening to it is the activity itself.<br/>    What I am trying to do is create an appreciation of the emotional depth<br/>to Beethoven&apos;s music and I don&apos;t think it can be plumbed by the straight and<br/>narrow of ET. Thus,  my hammer in hand, I crusade.  This list is one of the<br/>most important resources I have found for trying out ideas and hearing<br/>other&apos;s slants on things.
