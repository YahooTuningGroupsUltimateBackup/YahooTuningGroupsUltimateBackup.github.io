Kraig Grady has started his OWN<br/>&gt;splinter tuning group &quot;newjustintonation.&quot;</p><p>As David has pointed out, this group has been in existence for many months. I just subscribed, as I meant to before. I don&apos;t know if the &apos;wait for approval&apos; is actually something from the list owner or an implementation (new) from eGroups to cut down on spam. I&apos;ll write Kraig and find out, as I would think exclusion would be, to say the least, a detriment to any group.</p><p>&gt;I&apos;m not quite certain that it is a good idea to &quot;splinter&quot; off from<br/>&gt;the main tuning list over disagreements in style and content, if that<br/>&gt;had anything to do with it.</p><p>I agree. However, there are people on this list that continually refer to diametrically opposed &apos;camps&apos; of intonationalists (if I may use such a term). I find it tedious and a major distraction. Like a community this small needs to be ghetto-ized or something.</p><p>One other thing: you have mentioned recently about your being enamored of web-based use of the list, and (while it may have been an oversight) just today replied to a message by simply including the web link to the msg. What this does to any who *prefer* their email lists as god(s) intended them -- plain email -- I (and others) don&apos;t have a clue as to what one would be replying to in this case. I do a lot of work and downloading mail and reading it offline is the *only* remotely efficient way to run my life. I hope that even with web access to the list, people will utilize it in a manner to which most have been accustomed. To start with new modes of communication, when it is all so simple otherwise, risks another type of splinter. Not productive, IMHO.</p><p>&gt;I&apos;m more for &quot;plurality&quot; myself, and toleration of other peoples&apos; opinions &gt;and HEY, even PERSONALITIES!</p><p>Agreed.</p><p>&gt;There have been onerous (one-groups, get it) postings from various people &gt;from time-to-time, but &quot;big deal.&quot; Like they say &quot;get over it.&quot; Maybe I&apos;ve &gt;lived in New York too long, but it doesn&apos;t PHASE :) me at all, as long as &gt;we&apos;re all learning something and at least trying to communicate.</p><p>Hey, I can&apos;t stand what I hear that they&apos;ve done to Times Square, and I like NY with raw edges, thank you very much, but it does not excuse incivility. Some skins are thicker than others, and I don&apos;t think alternate tuning methodologies have to test shin thickness.</p><p>Anything else on this topic in general I&apos;d be happy to discuss, email-wise, off list. Keep the signal-2-noise ratio up around here...</p><p>Cheers,<br/>Jon</p></div><h3><a id=12622 href="#12622">ðŸ”—</a>Joseph Pehrson &#x3C;josephpehrson@compuserve.com&#x3E;</h3><span>9/10/2000 6:39:24 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@egroups.com">tuning@egroups.com</a>, &quot;Jonathan M.

Both Joe Monzo and I have<br/>been referencing messages this way.  But, you see, for people using<br/>&quot;Web based&quot; there is absolutely no way to figure out which &quot;Digest&quot;<br/>it is.  This is too bad that egroups doesn&apos;t include this in the<br/>message postings in some way... like when a new Digest occurs... but<br/>they DON&apos;T ... so there is no way for me to find out... Otherwise I<br/>would include both a message number AND a Digest Number!!!

However, there are people on this list that continually refer<br/>&gt;to diametrically opposed &apos;camps&apos; of intonationalists (if I may use such<br/>&gt;a term). I find it tedious and a major distraction. Like a community<br/>&gt;this small needs to be ghetto-ized or something.</p><p>Quite true, but it&apos;s a tricky balance sometimes, because, like adaptive<br/>tuning itself, the list has conflicting needs:</p><p>   . the need to accept varying tastes among the diverse membership.</p><p>   . the need to agree on a definition of terms so that any kind of<br/>     meaningful communication can take place.</p><p>This second, very real need, means that it&apos;s important not to shy away<br/>from disagreements.  When two schools have diverged, each claiming a<br/>certain word to have its own meaning, it strikes me as fair enough for<br/>each to argue that its interpretation could/should be accepted by the<br/>list, with some other term to be used for the other school&apos;s definition<br/>of the word.</p><p>Naturally, it is very helpful if each side is willing to be flexible<br/>and to take, at least on this list, some other set of terms in specific<br/>instances.  Failing this, posts can be clarified by stating which<br/>meaning is in use, as contrasted with which other meaning, for a given<br/>term.</p><p>When tempers flare, it means we&apos;re human.  It DOES make a lot of sense<br/>to cool off before pressing the &quot;Send&quot; button, of course, but we&apos;ve all<br/>failed at times do follow this simple procedure (at least I have!).  If<br/>some list members feel they are better served by forming other groups,<br/>so be it.  My own preference is to stay with this list, rough and tumble<br/>though it is.</p><p>JdL</p></div><h3><a id=12639 href="#12639">ðŸ”—</a>Joseph Pehrson &#x3C;pehrson@pubmedia.com&#x3E;</h3><span>9/11/2000 8:37:42 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@egroups.com">tuning@egroups.com</a>, &quot;John A. deLaubenfels&quot; &lt;jdl@a...&gt; wrote:</p><p><a href="http://www.egroups.com/message/tuning/12634">http://www.egroups.com/message/tuning/12634</a></p><p>  My own preference is to stay with this list, rough and<br/>tumble though it is.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; JdL</p><p>Hello John!</p><p>Not to spend much time on this... but my own feeling about the<br/>&quot;success&quot; of this list... and it IS very successful in terms of<br/>enthusiasm and number of posts is:</p><p>1) Actually the &quot;rough and tumble&quot; part of it... with exciting,<br/>although sometimes exasperating disagreements and</p><p>2) The high intellectual content which is challenging to everybody...<br/>a good portion of this being of a mathematical nature... although a<br/>sizable percentage is not...<br/>______ ____ ___ __ _<br/>Joseph Pehrson</p></div><h3><a id=13710 href="#13710">ðŸ”—</a>ALOE@REV.NET</h3><span>9/27/2000 9:21:05 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>At 05:46 PM 9/10/00 -0700, Jonathan M.
