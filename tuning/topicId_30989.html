I&apos;m trying posting this as<br/>email to see if the formatting survives.<br/>&gt; --------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>---<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Thanks for that Joseph. I love it.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Here&apos;s the progression on the chain of secors.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Std  Bv C Db^ D&gt; E[ F&lt;F#v G Ab^ A&gt; B[ C&lt;C#v D Eb^ E&gt; F] G&lt;G#v A Bb^<br/>&gt; FCG  C&gt; D[Eb&lt; Ev F Gb^ G&gt; A[Bb&lt; Bv C Db^ D&gt; E[ F&lt;F#v G Ab^ A&gt; B[ C&lt;<br/>&gt;                  +--------------+-----+--------------+<br/>&gt;                  +-----------------+--+-----------------+<br/>&gt;                  +-----------------+-----+--------------+<br/>&gt;                     +--------------+-----+-----------------+<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; So we can see that it would have more naturals in standard notation<br/>if it was shifted down by 3 secors.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; It&apos;s interesting that at the end you&apos;re only one note different<br/>from the starting chord shifted up a secor (except its not the same<br/>voicing). So (if you&apos;re willing to have a note jump by an octave) you<br/>could repeat the sequence a secor higher and crawl up the chain of<br/>secors like this.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Std  Bv C Db^ D&gt; E[ F&lt;F#v G Ab^ A&gt; B[ C&lt;C#v D Eb^ E&gt; F] G&lt;G#v A Bb^<br/>&gt; FCG  C&gt; D[Eb&lt; Ev F Gb^ G&gt; A[Bb&lt; Bv C Db^ D&gt; E[ F&lt;F#v G Ab^ A&gt; B[ C&lt;<br/>&gt;      +--------------+-----+--------------+<br/>&gt;      +-----------------+--+-----------------+<br/>&gt;      +-----------------+-----+--------------+<br/>&gt;         +--------------+-----+-----------------+<br/>&gt;         +--------------+-----+--------------+<br/>&gt;         +-----------------+--+-----------------+<br/>&gt;         +-----------------+-----+--------------+<br/>&gt;            +--------------+-----+-----------------+<br/>&gt;            +--------------+-----+--------------+<br/>&gt;            +-----------------+--+-----------------+<br/>&gt;            +-----------------+-----+--------------+<br/>&gt;               +--------------+-----+-----------------+<br/>&gt;               +--------------+-----+--------------+<br/>&gt;               +-----------------+--+-----------------+<br/>&gt;               +-----------------+-----+--------------+<br/>&gt;                  +--------------+-----+-----------------+<br/>&gt;                  +--------------+-----+--------------+<br/>&gt;                  +-----------------+--+-----------------+<br/>&gt;                  +-----------------+-----+--------------+<br/>&gt;                     +--------------+-----+-----------------+<br/>&gt;                     +--------------+-----+--------------+<br/>&gt;                     +-----------------+--+-----------------+<br/>&gt;                     +-----------------+-----+--------------+<br/>&gt;                        +--------------+-----+-----------------+<br/>&gt;                        +--------------+-----+--------------+<br/>&gt;                        +-----------------+--+-----------------+<br/>&gt;                        +-----------------+-----+--------------+<br/>&gt;                           +--------------+-----+-----------------+<br/>&gt; Std  Bv C Db^ D&gt; E[ F&lt;F#v G Ab^ A&gt; B[ C&lt;C#v D Eb^ E&gt; F] G&lt;G#v A Bb^<br/>&gt; FCG  C&gt; D[Eb&lt; Ev F Gb^ G&gt; A[Bb&lt; Bv C Db^ D&gt; E[ F&lt;F#v G Ab^ A&gt; B[ C&lt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Regards,<br/>&gt; -- Dave Keenan<br/>&gt; Brisbane, Australia<br/>&gt; <a href="http://uq.net.au/~zzdkeena">http://uq.net.au/~zzdkeena</a><br/>&gt; -- A country which has dangled the sword of nuclear holocaust over<br/>the world for half a century and claims that someone else invented<br/>terrorism is a country out of touch with reality. --John K.
