The<br/>parent company discontinued the venture around 1980.</p><p>&gt; What is the availability of the<br/>&gt; instrument?</p><p>No more.</p><p>The instrument was first made with two 5-octave organ keyboards,<br/>separately tunable, with all the octave relationships being<br/>maintained.  There were therefore 24 pitches in the octave playable<br/>at any one time, with the pitches being selectable from among 1024 in<br/>the octave (as a subharmonic series).  Around a dozen of these were<br/>sold to colleges and universities.  (Easley Blackwood used one to<br/>*write* his 13-through-24-ET microtonal pieces -- although he<br/>actually *recorded* them one track at a time on a synthesizer.)<br/>There was a lot of interest in the instrument, but sales depended on<br/>the ability of those interested to get funds approved for a purchase.</p><p>Three instruments were made with a generalized keyboard.  I have the<br/>first one.  The second was acquired by Joel Mandelbaum for Queens<br/>College, New York.  The third one was acquired by Paul Rapoport for<br/>McMaster University in Ontario, Canada (I&apos;m not sure of the city).<br/>Each of these three is unique, with capabilities not found on the<br/>other two.</p><p>&gt; What do they cost?
