It was a<br/>complicated item.  If you got or made one, you could just raise the nut and<br/>magnet it onto your metal neck.</p><p>DESCRIPTION: There was a metal layer on the neck where the fingerboard would<br/>go on the guitar.  Then, the interchangeable fingerboards were made of 3<br/>layers of material totaling about 4mm thick.  The bottom layer was a<br/>magnetic plastic like that magnetic tape they sell to put your kids art<br/>projects on the refrigerator.  Above that was a metal layer, presumably for<br/>stiffness, possibly also to shield the strings from the magnetism.  Finally<br/>there was a black plastic layer on top to make it look black like ebony.<br/>The frets were totally non-standard.  They had a metal bead on top as usual,<br/>but the tang was about 2mm wide and .5mm deep.  It penetrated the black<br/>plastic top layer and they were stuck to the metal layer underneath.  The<br/>guy who made it must have milled the frets himself from nickel-silver bar<br/>stock.  I don&apos;t know how they were fastened to the metal layer in the<br/>middle.</p><p>Jon had the action set quite low, and most of the frets played.  He said he<br/>didn&apos;t have any problems with it shifting when he played.  I don&apos;t remember<br/>who made it, but I remember Jon telling me that he&apos;s now out of business.<br/>You can see his web site for contact information and details.
