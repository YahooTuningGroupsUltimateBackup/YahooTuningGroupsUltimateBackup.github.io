I&apos;m in the habit of making a lattice for<br/>each piece of music to see how many fifths I can keep pure, if any,<br/>then I figure out which thirds can be pure, if any, and so forth,<br/>then temper only what needs it, and only as far as necessary.  I<br/>prefer that to sticking it in Pythagorean, a standard meantone, or a<br/>Well, and letting the chips fall where they may, even though it takes<br/>a lot more time.

The two reasons I came to this conclusion are: 1) the<br/>5-limit 75:64 is so close to 7:6 but yet sounds so different, and<br/>2) I have a previous experiment where I retuned the beginning<br/>of Satie&apos;s _Sarabande No. 1_ (with lots of unresolved &apos;major 7th&apos;<br/>and &apos;dominant 9th&apos; chords) in many different ways, and the<br/>versions that use 7-limit ratios clearly sound &apos;out of tune&apos;<br/>in many respects.</p><p>Thus, I would say that both you *and* Bob are correctly<br/>characterizing my reasons for my choice of tuning here.</p><p>&gt; ...But 27:23 and 34:29, with odd limits of 621 and 493<br/>&gt; respectively (unlike the offered example of 13:10), are a<br/>&gt; long way from anything anyone has yet shown to be recognizable<br/>&gt; as pockets.

In this case,<br/>instead of using the usual &apos;minor 3rd&apos; for a tonic (i) minor<br/>chord (which in standard JI theory is a 6/5), I&apos;m using the<br/>&apos;major 3rd&apos; of the VII chord as a substitute.</p><p>Note also that I was using some compositional sleight-of-hand<br/>here by &apos;tonicizing&apos; the D#-minor chord momentarily; in the<br/>overall context of the tune, D#-minor is really the vi<br/>(submediant) of the overall tonic F#-major.</p><p>Something else that should be considered in discussions of this<br/>by other Listers is that in my own pieces and retunings of music<br/>by others, I *never* consider odd-limit; I always think strictly<br/>in terms of prime-limit.</p><p>Honestly, to say anything more detailed about my compositional<br/>choice here would require me to go back and study the lattice<br/>and the MIDI-file in detail, in order to consider the ratios I<br/>used in the surrounding chords and melodic lines.

Maybe I can clarify.</p><p>I&apos;m simply trying to point out that considering a composition<br/>or tuning system *as a whole*, prime-factors are important<br/>because they introduce another dimension into the sound.<br/>As I pointed out, there is a limit to one&apos;s perception of<br/>this; this statement is true only of relatively low-integer<br/>prime-factors (certainly including 2, 3, 5, 7, and 11,<br/>and *possibly limited only to those*).  And certainly, there<br/>is also an exponent-limit involved in our perception of<br/>this: only ratios that are quite close in lattice-space<br/>to a given local 1/1 will be perceived as demonstrating<br/>these multiple dimensions.  As you point out, and as I<br/>already felt I had expressed, using either higher primes<br/>or higher exponents or both will give ratios that come<br/>arbitrarily close to any others.</p><p>If you&apos;re in agreement with this, then what I&apos;m saying is<br/>simply that when listening to a piece whose tuning is full<br/>of 5-limit ratios, a 7-limit one can &apos;stick out like a sore<br/>thumb&apos;.  Again, I&apos;m not saying that this is *always* or<br/>*necessarily* the case, but in my experience, a sudden *emphatic*<br/>use of 7 in a 5-limit context can sound awfully out-of-tune.<br/>And I would say that whether the higher prime is emphasized<br/>or not, and exactly *how* it is emphasized, has an important<br/>bearing on its &apos;in/out-of-tuneness&apos;.  Any disagreement with that?</p><p>You might like to note that right after this D#-minor cadence,<br/>the &apos;hook&apos; shifts the tonic to F#-major, and I used an 11:8<br/>in the penultimate chord which sounds weird but (to me) *not*<br/>out-of-tune.  That&apos;s the reason for my note above about *how*<br/>the higher prime is emphasized.</p><p>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; and<br/>&gt; &gt; 2) I have a previous experiment where I retuned the beginning<br/>&gt; &gt; of Satie&apos;s _Sarabande No. 1_ (with lots of unresolved<br/>&gt; &gt; &apos;major 7th&apos; and &apos;dominant 9th&apos; chords) in many different<br/>&gt; &gt; ways, and the versions that use 7-limit ratios clearly sound<br/>&gt; &gt; &apos;out of tune&apos; in many respects.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; What does that have to do with this???</p><p>Only that it was a previous listening experience on which I drew<br/>when selecting ratios in my retuning of _3 Plus 4_.  The Satie<br/>piece, while stylistically very different from my tune, has a<br/>chord vocabulary that&apos;s rather similar to that which I used in<br/>_3 Plus 4_.</p><p>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; David F., your &apos;extended reference&apos; analysis of this is<br/>&gt; &gt; basically correct...

In fact, 15/16 isn&apos;t even a part of the cadence which<br/>leads to this 64:75:96 D#-minor chord! - I arrived at it thru<br/>a plagal cadence with a chord-root motion of B - A#-minor -<br/>G#-minor - D#-minor, then I even emphasize the plagal aspect<br/>at the cadence itself with i-iv-i.  The 15/16 only appears<br/>*before* this progression as a quick passing-tone.</p><p>But I still think that the Schoenbergian kind of substitution<br/>I mentioned is in effect here, simply because of my prolonged<br/>tonicization of D#-minor.  I think the ear/brain perceives<br/>the relationship of 75/64 as the &apos;major 3rd&apos; of the &apos;leading-tone&apos;<br/>anyway, and accepts it as a different flavor of &apos;minor 3rd&apos;<br/>because its relationship to the 1/1 (D#) is clear-cut.</p><p>Like I said and you agreed, my foreknowledge of how the 5-limit<br/>lattice is constructed certainly affected my decsion of how<br/>to tune this chord.</p><p>-monz<br/><a href="http://www.ixpres.com/interval/monzo/homepage.html">http://www.ixpres.com/interval/monzo/homepage.html</a><br/>&apos;All roads lead to n^0&apos;</p></div><h3><a id=16032 href="#16032">ðŸ”—</a>Paul H.
