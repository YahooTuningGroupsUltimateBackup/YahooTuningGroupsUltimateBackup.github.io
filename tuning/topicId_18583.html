As it happens, it is<br/>pretty close to exactly in phase, by serendipity.</p><p>Would be nice to hear it on an actual crystal bowl patch!</p><p>Maybe I&apos;ll have a go, later, if someone else doesn&apos;t do it first.</p><p>In fact, one could maybe play it on the actual instruments too??</p><p>You need four singing bowls, and three Shakuhachis. Surprisingly<br/>few instruments!</p><p>(though could be more or less depending on the<br/>the partials of the actual instruments).</p><p>The three Shakuhachis could come in gently as the singing bowls<br/>slowly fade away into silence.</p><p>But I suppose three of the singing bowls would have to be made<br/>especially for the piece }:-(</p><p>Since pitch bending is used a lot in Shakuhachi music, getting<br/>the exact pitch should be no problem there, - and the players could<br/>listen to the speed of the beats as well as the partials in the<br/>singing bowls, to help keep the notes exactly on pitch.</p><p>Shakuhachi music with lots of pitch bending:<br/><a href="http://www.yakrider.com/Resources/books/books_meditation.htm#KOMUSO">http://www.yakrider.com/Resources/books/books_meditation.htm#KOMUSO</a></p><p>Robert</p></div>
