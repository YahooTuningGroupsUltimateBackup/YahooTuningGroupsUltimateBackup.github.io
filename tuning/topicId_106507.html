Some of<br/>the fliters just omit samples and leave the rest to the low pass filter<br/>of the sound card. Besides that you can use any DAW software. Probably<br/>Audacity would be enough if it has such a filter.</p><p>I just sampled two sine waves with 440 Hz and 440 Hz + 0.1ct with a<br/>192kHz sampling rate and 24 bit resolution and got a maximal difference<br/>between the two signals of approximately -87 dB full scale.</p><p>When you are working with MIDI you can use Mutabor<br/>(<a href="http://www.math.tu-dresden.de/~mutabor/">http://www.math.tu-dresden.de/~mutabor/</a>) to do any tuning that can be<br/>encoded using pitch and pitch bend information. Which means the smalest<br/>step is a 8192th of a semitone.</p><p>There are several issues with this approach:<br/>&bull; Many instruments support only 7bit pitch bend, which lead to a<br/>resolution of &pm;1/64 semitone.<br/>&bull; The oscillators in the instrument may differ by more than 0.1ct. So<br/>that such a pitch shifting might get lost in the tolerance of the<br/>instrument.<br/>&bull; As far as I know the cochlear resolution is about 1 to 3 ct. This does<br/>not necessarily mean that the ear has this resolution as the signal is<br/>transferred in the nerve fibers phase aligned to the vibrating of the<br/>basilar membrane (but only up to 4kHz). Theoretically there could be<br/>some neural correlators that can sense the difference between the<br/>signals. On the other hand the difference could be lost in the<br/>stochastic noise of the neural pulses.</p><p>Tobias</p><p>On 11.09.2015 17:26, Srijan Deshpande <a href="mailto:srijand@gmail.com">srijand@gmail.com</a> [TUNING] wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Hello,<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Does anyone know of software that can shift pitch in increments of<br/>&gt; less than 1 cent?<br/>&gt; For instance if I have a sample (a wav file) and I want to raise its<br/>&gt; pitch by 0.1 cents, how do I do it?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Thank you,<br/>&gt; Srijan<br/>&gt;</p></div><h3><a id=106509 href="#106509">ðŸ”—</a>jpff &#x3C;jpff@...&#x3E;</h3><span>9/12/2015 5:26:05 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Erik de Castro Lopo&apos;s Secret Rabbit Code library does that.</p><p><a href="http://www.mega-nerd.com/SRC/">http://www.mega-nerd.com/SRC/</a></p><p>On Fri, 11 Sep 2015, Srijan Deshpande srijand@...

But I<br/>would recommend trying Audacity which has some kind of pitch shifting<br/>command. I don&apos;t remember how precise it is however.</p><p>I know MIDI can adjust pitches (as least in theory) down to 1/4096 of a<br/>semitone using a pitchbend.</p></div>
