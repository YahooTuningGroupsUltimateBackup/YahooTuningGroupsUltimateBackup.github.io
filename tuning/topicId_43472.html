Then differential coherence, melodic coherence, spectral coherence,<br/>(any other ?) are good tools, and that converge sometimes, to help us to understand<br/>tunings done mostly by ear, when not determinated by instrument makers, who have<br/>different logics. Ambiguity between close intervals showing different &quot;polarities&quot; of the<br/>same entity (especially such as the neutral third...) can also be considered as a good reason,<br/>in some instruments, to use something in the middle, as we know. This does not means<br/>that acoustics are always absent, nor that they are highly subjective. Reality is multiple.</p></div>
