Another<br/>way of looking at it is that four steps of 8:7 and one of 7:6 almost add up to an<br/>octave.</p><p>&gt; But a _linear temperament_ based on only the primes 3 and 7 (and 2<br/>&gt; for octaves) and the 1029/1024 should be quite interesting . . . in<br/>&gt; fact I was going to suggest that we additionally investigate not only<br/>&gt; this set of primes, but also the BP case of primes 5 and 7 (and _3_<br/>&gt; for equivalence) for our linear temperament paper.</p><p>And I also thought that Margo had experimented with this temperament.  Haven&apos;t I<br/>already done that BP search?  I&apos;ve had a look at the 3.7.9 diamond, and these are<br/>the unison vectors for the top 10 temperaments:</p><p>[-11, -9, 0, 9] 40353607:40310784<br/>[1, 10, 0, -6] 118098:117649<br/>[-4, -1, 0, 2] 49:48<br/>[-10, 1, 0, 3] 1029:1024<br/>[25, -14, 0, -1] 33554432:33480783<br/>[-11, -9, 0, 9] 40353607:40310784<br/>[-11, -9, 0, 9] 40353607:40310784<br/>[-10, 1, 0, 3] 1029:1024<br/>[-35, 15, 0, 4] 34451725707L:34359738368L<br/>[6, -2, 0, -1] 64:63</p><p>There&apos;s some repetitition, so some of the temperaments will have torsion.  [25,<br/>-14, 0, -1] or 33554432:33480783 is the 2-3-7 schisma.  The top one, [-11, -9, 0,<br/>9] or 40353607:40310784 gives two 9-equals 35 cents apart.  It&apos;s accurate to around<br/>0.2 cents.</p><p>The second one has mapping [(2, 0), (4, -3), (7, -5)] and a 166 cent generator, two<br/>otonalities in the 8-note MOS and is accurate to a cent or so.  Consistent with 14-<br/>and 22-equal.</p><p>The third one is mapping [(1, 0), (2, -2), (3, -1)], consistent with 4, 5 and<br/>9-equal.
