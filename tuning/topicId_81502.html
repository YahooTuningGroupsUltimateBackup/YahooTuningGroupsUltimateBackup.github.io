As<br/>&gt; &gt; soon as you get into that though, you must look at the<br/>&gt; &gt; possiblities of other ethnic, local, and emotive interpretations<br/>&gt; &gt; of it as well (which would involve timbre and timing as well<br/>&gt; &gt; of course). Good job, Joe!<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Joe not only made the file, he helped (along with Paul Erlich,<br/>&gt; myself, and others) discover that Vicentino had actually<br/>&gt; proposed a tuning solution like this in the 16th century<br/>&gt; (though it&apos;s unclear if he understood just how universal his<br/>&gt; proposal was).  You can read more at:<br/>&gt; <a href="http://tonalsoft.com/monzo/vicentino/vicentino.aspx">http://tonalsoft.com/monzo/vicentino/vicentino.aspx</a><br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; Marcel&apos;s version sounds fine on the &quot;piano&quot;,<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Not to my ear.  It&apos;s certainly more tolerable than the<br/>&gt; slower versions, but the problems are still evident.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; -Carl<br/>&gt;</p><p>Groovy. Is that really adaptive JI that Joe did, or a very close<br/>approximation from some ET? The timbre he used is a bit woggly, which<br/>is absolutely fine by me, but I guess it would obscure any difference<br/>between an actual adaptive JI and an approxmition within a cent or<br/>two.</p><p>A big part of why this works, and perhaps an indication that it was<br/>already considered in the original composition, conciously or not, is<br/>where the adaptions take place.
