Schulter &#x3C;mschulter@xxxxx.xxxx&#x3E;</h3><span>6/7/1999 6:47:03 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Hello, there, and here are replies to a couple of points from Joe<br/>Monzo in our continuing dialogue.</p><p>&gt;&gt; Many chants also have prominent tritone relations, e.g.<br/>&gt;&gt; between F and B-natural in G Mixolydian (Modes 7 and 8, or<br/>&gt;&gt; _tetrardus_).</p><p>&gt; Well... of course we can&apos;t be certain about what happened<br/>&gt; in practice, but indications are that the B-natural in these<br/>&gt; modes was frequently, or perhaps virtually always, altered thru<br/>&gt; _musica ficta_ to a Bb.</p><p>While Bb may _sometimes_ occur in chants and monophonic songs centered<br/>on G Mixolydian, I agree with such scholars as Gordon Anderson that<br/>melodic figures with tritonic outlines such as B3-A3-G3-F3-G3 are<br/>characteristic of this family of modes, and need not be altered.</p><p>In later medieval discussions of chant, the view is sometimes<br/>expressed that Bb is most common in tritus or Lydian on F, rather<br/>common in protus or Dorian on D, less common in deuterus or Phrygian<br/>on E, and least common in tetrardus or Mixolydian on G. One could look<br/>into distinctions between authentic and plagal modes, also, but this<br/>is a rough summary.</p><p>This discussion also raises a fine point about the medieval and<br/>colloquial modern senses of _musica ficta_. In the latter usage, it<br/>often simply means &quot;unwritten accidentals inferred by the performers,&quot;<br/>a sense including an added Bb, for example to avoid a tritone.</p><p>In a medieval sense, however, _musica ficta_ means any use of a note<br/>foreign to the usual _musica recta_ gamut which includes the seven<br/>diatonic notes plus Bb, whether by express indication in a manuscript<br/>or by a performer&apos;s inference. Thus adding an unwritten Bb to a chant<br/>would in this medieval sense be an exercise in _musica recta_, while<br/>an F# expressly indicated in a 14th-century manuscript would be<br/>_musica ficta_ (although not in the modern sense of an &quot;inferred&quot;<br/>accidental).</p><p>It gets even more involved: thus either B or Bb is normally _musica<br/>recta_ because both notes are integral to the gamut or hexachord<br/>system; but the Bb immediately above Gamma Ut (more or less equivalent<br/>to Bb2, without any suggestion of absolute pitch) is _ficta_ because<br/>it&apos;s not part of any recognized standard hexachord.</p><p>I mention this because it&apos;s quite normal for both senses of _ficta_ to<br/>come up in discussions of this kind.</p><p>&gt; PS - Please give the citation for Mark Linley&apos;s study of<br/>&gt; 14th-century keyboard music.  I&apos;m fascinated.</p><p>Here are some works of Mark Lindley on the topic of medieval and<br/>Renaissance intonation, and there are more on topics such as early<br/>meantone tunings that I could add:</p><p>Lindley, Mark, 1980a. &quot;Pythagorean Intonation and the Rise of the<br/>Triad,&quot; _Royal Musical Association Research Chronicle_ 16:4-61. ISSN<br/>0080-4460. A germinal source, this article explores the artistic and<br/>expressive value of Pythagorean tuning in a 13th-14th century Gothic<br/>context, and then presents both theoretical and musical evidence for<br/>an ingenuous modification of this tuning around 1400 to suit a new<br/>stylistic leaning toward more blending thirds (see also Section 4.5 of<br/>this article).</p><p>Lindley, Mark, 1980b. &quot;Pythagorean Intonation,&quot; _New Grove Dictionary<br/>of Music and Musicians_ 15:485-487, ed. Stanley Sadie. Washington, DC:<br/>Grove&apos;s Dictionaries of Music. ISBN 0333231112. This short article<br/>gives a handy summary of Lindley&apos;s longer study on &quot;Pythagorean<br/>Intonation and the Rise of the Triad&quot; (see previous item).</p><p>Lindley, Mark, 1980c. &quot;Temperaments,&quot; _New Grove Dictionary of Music<br/>and Musicians_ 18:660-674, ed. Stanley Sadie. Washington, DC: Grove&apos;s<br/>Dictionaries of Music. ISBN 0333231112. This concise survey gives an<br/>overview of developments from the late 15th century on, with a large<br/>bibliography.</p><p>Most respectfully,</p><p>Margo Schulter<br/><a href="mailto:mschulter@value.net">mschulter@value.net</a></p></div>
