Instead,<br/>&gt;chromatic textures are used for exoticism, danger, or catastrophe (i.e.<br/>&gt;accompaning the Stone Guest  in _Don Giovanni-). For these purposes, the<br/>&gt;uneven patterns of meantone chromatic scales are ideal.</p><p>&gt;There is also a technical argument to be made: Viennese classical fingering<br/>&gt;avoided the thumb, thus passage work was continuously broken into grupetti<br/>&gt;of two or three pitches, yielding anything but the smooth effect of high<br/>&gt;romantic pianism. (in contrast, Bach famously used his thumb!).</p><p>Are we talking about the same Mozart and Bach??? I hear plenty of chromatic<br/>runs in Mozart that sound perfect as even, featureless ascents or descents,<br/>but none in Bach. I suppose we&apos;ll have to agree to disagree.</p></div>
