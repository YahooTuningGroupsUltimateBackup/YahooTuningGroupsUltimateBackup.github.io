The first part of the note name would be the<br/>Pythagorean note, which should be between G-flat and A-sharp. The first<br/>number should express raising or lowering in Pythagorean commas (one step in<br/>53-tone). The second number should be halves of a Mercator&apos;s comma, or one<br/>step in 306-tone. A third number (optional) for extra-fine tuning, the<br/>665-tone comma.</p><p>But the pure major third is still E-1+1 (not using a third number), and a<br/>12-tet fifth is G+0-1.</p></div>
