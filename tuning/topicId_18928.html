I&apos;ve had some really compelling listening experiences, where I<br/>had Bill to play gongs while I sang the notes I heard in the Gong<br/>chord. They could so clearly and distinctly be heard, that it makes<br/>me wish to explore composing/singing with the inharmonic pitches<br/>found in the timbre.</p><p>Your reply is very interesting to me and I see (and hear) your point<br/>about what the resonators do (Mt. Meru Rules!!!). I think whether or<br/>not partials might be of importance, would likely depend on the<br/>physical properties of the individual instrument itself.  Where there<br/>is ambiguity as to the fundamental (as can be true of Gong Spectra),<br/>is where things can get interesting! My preliminary thoughts about<br/>this, are that if one could use a tuning that matched the inharmonic<br/>timbres, then a special kind of Timbral Just Intonation would be<br/>possible. That I could clearly sing it and make my voice unison with<br/>the partials, makes me want to go deeper. Being able to sing (or make<br/>melody with) something usually directs my ear toward things, and it&apos;s<br/>a union of voice to timbre that I seek.&quot;</p></div><h3>ligonj@northstate.net</h3><span>2/18/2001 11:50:47 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In tuning@y..., &quot;Daniel Wolf&quot; &lt;djwolf1@m...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt; I have a bit of experience with ensembles of gongs and idiophones,<br/>including<br/>&gt; making, tuning, and playing with them.</p><p>Daniel,</p><p>Hello!</p><p>Thanks for this most interesting post!
