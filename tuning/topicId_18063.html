Beating, or critical bands,<br/>&gt; &gt; or whatever can&apos;t be the _only_ component, though it may<br/>&gt; &gt; well be the most important for chords with small numbers of<br/>&gt; &gt; notes.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; It seems to fail pretty miserable with just 4 notes, each of which has an ordinary<br/>&gt; harmonic timbre.</p><p>Do you have an example in mind that shows this particularly<br/>clearly?</p><p>&gt; &gt; What if one were to choose the intervals for an &quot;otonal chord&quot;<br/>&gt; &gt; from an inharmonic series of pitches, and used the virtual<br/>&gt; &gt; harmonic series to make a recognisable inharmonic timbre,<br/>&gt; &gt; such as the sound of bells, say.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Then the effect would fall apart, since the brain is only looking for &quot;the&quot; harmonic<br/>series<br/>&gt; (perhaps stretched a little). There&apos;s nothing to prevent you from constructing two<br/>bells,<br/>&gt; with timbres which are the exact mirror-images of one another,  such that one bell&apos;s<br/>&gt; &quot;utonal&quot; is the other bell&apos;s &quot;otonal&quot; and vice-versa with respect to their timbres.</p><p>I&apos;m not sure - okay I could imagine one could possibly construct such bells, but one of<br/>them would make a more &quot;natural&quot; bell sound than the other.</p><p>I.e. more familiar - here, maybe a church bell sound, in parts of Africa, maybe an agogo,<br/>in Java, maybe a gamelan gong, and so on.</p><p>I&apos;d want to listen to an actual example of it done, to see what happens.</p><p>Indeed, one could construct the mirror image bell sounds, mabye on computer anyway,<br/>and try playing a tune on one or other, then ask which is most concordant of the<br/>utonal and otonal chords, and see if the bell sound one has heard affects perception of<br/>consonance of the chords based on its (in)harmonic series.</p><p>&gt; &gt; Or indeed, suppose one combined them to make<br/>&gt; &gt; the overtone series of the inharmonic timbre itself?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; That _does_ lead to some consonance for the Sethares reason -- you will have lots of<br/>&gt; coinciding partials.</p><p>Yes, for &quot;stretched harmonics&quot;, say, you would for the otonal, but also for the utonal<br/>one.</p><p>Idea was, the otonal one might sound more consonant.</p><p>Also, maybe for some inharmonic timbres, the partials will be so<br/>irregularly spaced, that combining the fundamentals to make an otonal<br/>series of notes doesn&apos;t give many coinciding partials at all.<br/>In theory, it could have no coinciding partials.<br/>How irregular can the harmonics of an inharmonic partial be?</p><p>N.B. this leads into something I&apos;m finding a bit mysterious.</p><p>You have exactly the same numbers<br/>of shared harmonics for the diads, but it seems, if you take account<br/>of combinations of 3 or more notes simultaneously, you actually<br/>have _more_ coinciding groups of 3 partials simultaneously in the utonal chord:<br/>E,g,</p><p>harmonic series on 2 3 and 5 are<br/>2 4 6 8 10 12 14 16 ...<br/>3 6 9 12 15 18 21 24 27 30<br/>5 10 15 20 25 30 35 40<br/>all three share<br/>30, 60, 90,...</p><p>In the respective harmonic series, these are:<br/>(2*) 15 30 45 60 ...<br/>(3*) 10 20 30 40 ...<br/>(5*) 6 12 18 24 ...</p><p>Series on 1/2, 1/3 and 1/5<br/>1/2 1 3/2 2 5/2 3 7/2,...<br/>1/3 2/3 1 4/3 5/3 2 7/3 8/3 3,...<br/>1/5 2/5 3/5 4/5 1 6/5 7/5 8/5 9/5 2,...</p><p>All three share 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, ...<br/>- or in the respective harmonic series:<br/>(1/2*) 2 4 6 8 10,...<br/>(1/3*)3 6 9 12,...<br/>(1/5*)5 10 15 20,...</p><p>Would happen even more so with four or more notes.</p><p>E.g. add 7, and 1/7, and in the otonal series,<br/>you get all four partials coinciding every 210<br/>notes of the harmonic series, and in the utonal<br/>series, evey 7 notes.</p><p>On first thought, one would think this would mean the utonal<br/>chord should be _more_ consonant as far as beating partials<br/>are concerned than the otonal one.</p><p>Am I missing something?</p><p>Same would happen with an inharmonic timbre if the partials<br/>were stretched uniformly from the harmonic series partials.</p><p>(N.B. with FTS, looks as if I&apos;ll need to check for all groups of<br/>three beating partials in Helmholtz type searches for triads,<br/>- could first find which triads have consonant component diads,<br/>in order to make the search manageable,<br/>then order the ones found according to the beating partials in the<br/>total chord)</p><p>&gt; &gt; Also would be interesting to see if the amount of consonance<br/>&gt; &gt; depended on how familiar one was with the virtual<br/>&gt; &gt; inharmonic timbre constructed. For instance, would<br/>&gt; &gt; a regular gamelan player find a virtual overtone<br/>&gt; &gt; series made up using one of the typical gamelan timbres<br/>&gt; &gt; more consonant than others who are somewhat<br/>&gt; &gt; less familiar with that timbre?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Well some theorists have proposed that the virtual pitch phenomenon normally<br/>&gt; associated with the harmonic series could be a result of training (including prenatal<br/>&gt; training involving the mother&apos;s voice) rather than genetics; if they are right, then<br/>there<br/>&gt; may be something to what you&apos;re saying -- though there is far less consistency in what<br/>&gt; constitutes a &quot;typical gamelan timbre&quot; than in what constitutes a &quot;harmonic overtone<br/>&gt; series&quot;. In any case, the effect would require a very extensive training period with the<br/>&gt; timbre in question in order to be measurable.<br/>&gt;</p><p>I wonder how long it does take to get used to a new timbre. Perhaps it would<br/>take a long time - if so, you&apos;d have to check out the chords with players of the<br/>instruments, and others who are unfamiliar with them.</p><p>However it is also possible that playing a totally new inharmonic timbre to someone for a<br/>short while, enough so that they can recognise it again, might be enough to predispose<br/>one to hear the inharmonic otonal chord as more harmonious.</p><p>Or maybe they&apos;d need to play it on a midi keyboard for a short while, or<br/>something like that.</p><p>I&apos;d have thought that might possibly be enough to make it work if the effect does<br/>happen, though of course one would expect it to be stronger if one<br/>has played the instrument for a long time, or listened to much<br/>music on it.</p><p>Looks as if the best experiment to do would be to see<br/>if one had more consonance in the otonal chord than<br/>the utonal one when using two timbres,<br/>with few partials in common - one timbre for the<br/>otonal /utonal pitches, and one for the actual notes.<br/>and using an inharmonic timbre for the otonal /utonal<br/>pitches, and either inharmonic or harmonic for the<br/>actual notes.</p><p>I&apos;d like to give that a try, just because on the (maybe remote)<br/>possibility that it did work, it would be an interesting result.</p><p>Will be easy to do with FTS if I can find a nice table of partials with<br/>their volumes for an inharmonic timbre.</p><p>Robert</p></div><h3><a id=18089 href="#18089">ðŸ”—</a>Paul H.

Check the<br/>archives. We went through this in great detail, and it appears<br/>incontrovertible that _otonal_ simplicity is _more_ important in explaining<br/>our perceptions than the simpicity of the six individual intervals in each<br/>tetrad. For example, everyone gave 4:5:6:7 a much more favorable rating than<br/>1/7:1/6:1/5:1/4, even though the two chords contain exactly the same<br/>intervals. Much more evidence along these lines was seen in the perceptions<br/>of the other 34 tetrads.</p><p>&gt;I&apos;m not sure - okay I could imagine one could possibly construct such<br/>bells, but one of<br/>&gt;them would make a more &quot;natural&quot; bell sound than the other.</p><p>Why would you say that?</p><p>&gt;Indeed, one could construct the mirror image bell sounds, mabye on computer<br/>anyway,<br/>&gt;and try playing a tune on one or other, then ask which is most concordant<br/>of the<br/>&gt;utonal and otonal chords, and see if the bell sound one has heard affects<br/>perception of<br/>&gt;consonance of the chords based on its (in)harmonic series.</p><p>&gt;&gt; &gt; Or indeed, suppose one combined them to make<br/>&gt;&gt; &gt; the overtone series of the inharmonic timbre itself?<br/>&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt; That _does_ lead to some consonance for the Sethares reason -- you will<br/>have lots of<br/>&gt;&gt; coinciding partials.</p><p>&gt;Yes, for &quot;stretched harmonics&quot;, say, you would for the otonal, but also for<br/>the utonal<br/>&gt;one.</p><p>&gt;Idea was, the otonal one might sound more consonant.</p><p>I think it all comes down to the specifics of the bell timbre in question.<br/>If the original bell timbre was closer to an integer harmonic series than to<br/>an integer subharmonic series, then probably yes. If the original bell<br/>timbre was closer to an integer subharmonic series than to an integer<br/>harmonic series, its mirror-image would likely be more consonant in this<br/>context.</p><p>&gt;Also, maybe for some inharmonic timbres, the partials will be so<br/>&gt;irregularly spaced, that combining the fundamentals to make an otonal<br/>&gt;series of notes doesn&apos;t give many coinciding partials at all.<br/>&gt;In theory, it could have no coinciding partials.<br/>&gt;How irregular can the harmonics of an inharmonic partial be?</p><p>No Robert, as long as the inharmonic timbre has a particular spectrum in<br/>cents, there will always be coinciding partials, e.g., the fifth partial of<br/>the fourth member of the otonal series will always coincide with the fourth<br/>partial of the fifth member of the otonal series, since the partial in<br/>question is a distance from the &quot;fundamental&quot; of the otonal series that is<br/>equal to the distance from the first to the fourth partial, plus the<br/>distance from the first to fifth partial, in the inharmonic series in<br/>question.</p><p>&gt;You have exactly the same numbers<br/>&gt;of shared harmonics for the diads, but it seems, if you take account<br/>&gt;of combinations of 3 or more notes simultaneously, you actually<br/>&gt;have _more_ coinciding groups of 3 partials simultaneously in the utonal<br/>chord:<br/>&gt;[...]<br/>&gt;On first thought, one would think this would mean the utonal<br/>&gt;chord should be _more_ consonant as far as beating partials<br/>&gt;are concerned than the otonal one.</p><p>&gt;Am I missing something?</p><p>That&apos;s exactly right, and I&apos;ve brought this up here on the list many times,<br/>to point to the glaring inadequacies of the &quot;coinciding partials&quot;<br/>explanation of consonance.</p><p>&gt;Same would happen with an inharmonic timbre if the partials<br/>&gt;were stretched uniformly from the harmonic series partials.</p><p>Or even with an _arbitrary_ inharmonic timbre with a given spectrum in cents<br/>-- the argument runs as above, but now you&apos;ll have _three_ distances between<br/>partials to add, and that distance will be spanned in _three_ different<br/>ways.</p></div>
