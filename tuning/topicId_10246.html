Of course the &quot;minor triad&quot; is up the Otonal series at 6:7:9,<br/>but that has nothing to do with the Utonal, yes??</p><p>So does the Utonal ratio series really &quot;mean&quot; anything?? It seems there<br/>is a kind of &quot;descending series&quot; from &quot;difference tones,&quot; yes?? or does<br/>this have no relation to it???</p><p>____________ _____ ____ __ _<br/>Joseph Pehrson</p></div>
