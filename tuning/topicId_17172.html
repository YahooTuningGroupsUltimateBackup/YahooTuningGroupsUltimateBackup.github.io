When Liszt looks over to see what his young<br/>visitor thinks, he finds Brahms asleep: a premonition of the major<br/>split that will occur in 19th-century European music. Brahms claims<br/>&gt;that he was simply listening with his eyes closed...</p><p>Uh huh... And Virgil Thomson used to listen to music for his reviews<br/>after opulent dinners with wine with his eyes closed as well...Much<br/>better concentration that way...<br/>__________ _____ __ ___<br/>Joseph Pehrson</p></div>
