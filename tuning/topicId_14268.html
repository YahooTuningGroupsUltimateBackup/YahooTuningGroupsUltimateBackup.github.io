Schulter &#x3C;MSCHULTER@VALUE.NET&#x3E;</h3><span>10/10/2000 9:35:40 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Hello, there, and thank you, Jon Wild, for an opportunity to clarify<br/>my views on the distinction between the Phi-based Noble Mediant as a<br/>scale generator applied to logarithmic fractions of an octave, and as<br/>a &quot;Noble Mediant of complexity&quot; applied to two simple interval ratios.</p><p>With Dave Keenan and Paul Erlich, I agree that it is very important to<br/>keep these distinctions clear -- and very easy for the distinction to<br/>get blurred, which is a good reason to emphasize it early and often.</p><p>Your helpful questions may illustrate a kind of corollary to<br/>Murphy&apos;s Law: if a text leaves any room for ambiguity on this kind of<br/>distinction, astute and interested readers are likely to pick up on<br/>this and get the impression that the two applications may be<br/>synonymous.</p><p>As you pointed out, there are passages in what Dave and I have written<br/>by no means excluding such a reading, and I could cite some remarks in<br/>one of my recent papers where I might wisely have added some specific<br/>disclaimers. Dave commented on this, and your inquiry shows the wisdom<br/>of his advice.</p><p>Specifically, the use of Phi with logarithmic fractions of the octave,<br/>as in both Thorwald Kornerup&apos;s Golden Meantone and Keenan Pepper&apos;s<br/>neo-Gothic counterpart, may often result in strikingly &quot;simple&quot; and<br/>&quot;concordant&quot; interval ratios.</p><p>As Paul observed, Kornerup&apos;s Golden Meantone is very &quot;concordant&quot; in<br/>an historical 5-limit sense, being a kind of compromise between<br/>1/4-comma meantone (pure major thirds) and Zarlino&apos;s 2/7-comma (major<br/>and minor thirds equally tempered by 1/7-comma).</p><p>At the most obvious level, Keenan Pepper&apos;s neo-Gothic Phi-based tuning<br/>produces very &quot;concordant&quot; fifths and fourths only about 2.14 cents<br/>from pure. As in Pythagorean tuning, these stable concords provide<br/>resolutions for all the unstable intervals. Like Kornerup&apos;s Golden<br/>Meantone in a 5-limit setting, Pepper&apos;s tuning in a 3-limit setting<br/>provides near-ideal stable concords.</p><p>Further, as I&apos;ve suggested in some recent posts, the _differences_<br/>between the ratios of certain unstable intervals in Keenan Pepper&apos;s<br/>tuning and Dave Keenan&apos;s &quot;Noble Mediants of complexity&quot; for these same<br/>intervals can be significant.</p><p>For example, the regular major third in this tuning is around 416<br/>cents, a bit smaller than 14:11, and about 6 or 7 cents smaller than<br/>the &quot;Noble Mediant of maximum complexity&quot; we get from 5:4 and 9:7<br/>(~422.487 cents). This means that the interval is somewhat _milder_<br/>than in 17-tET, for example.</p><p>Both Dave and I have agreed that if one wishes to maximize the<br/>complexity -- and here we might also both say &quot;dissonance&quot; or<br/>&quot;tension&quot; -- of major thirds, or the complexity of thirds and sixths<br/>generally, then 17-tET would be an excellent choice. In contrast,<br/>something like Keenan Pepper&apos;s tuning (or the region in the vicinity<br/>of around 29-tET to 46-tET in general) represents a shading somewhere<br/>between Pythagorean and 17-tET.</p><p>Of course, Paul, your example of Golden Meantone really makes the<br/>distinction stand out. The same variety of octave-logarithmic<br/>Phi-based approach can produce either a Renaissance-style meantone<br/>(with the ratio of diatonic to chromatic semitones equal to Phi) or a<br/>neo-Gothic style tuning (with the ratio of chromatic to diatonic<br/>semitones equal to Phi).</p><p>Anyway, as Dave has commented, it&apos;s very important to make this<br/>distinction between Phi in relation to octave-fractions, and Phi in<br/>relation to simple interval ratios as a &quot;Noble Mediant of complexity.&quot;</p><p>Sometimes there can be fortuitous overlaps between the two approaches,<br/>as when Keenan Pepper&apos;s tuning (Phi-based logarithmic division of<br/>octave) happens to include a close approximation of the interval ratio<br/>Phi (~833.1 cents, maybe a flavor of &quot;supraminor sixth&quot;).</p><p>However, there are lots of other tunings which may approximate<br/>Phi-based mediants of &quot;maximum complexity&quot; between two simpler<br/>interval ratios much more closely than tunings built from Phi-based<br/>divisions of the octave.</p><p>For example, with our 5:4-9:7 region, the mediant of complexity is<br/>around 422.49 cents. Kornerup&apos;s Golden Meantone gives us a diminished<br/>fourth of around 430.28 cents, while Pepper&apos;s counterpart gives us a<br/>regular major third at around 416.38 cents. However, a 17-tET major<br/>third gets us much closer (~423.53 cents), and a diminished fourth in<br/>2/9-comma meantone even closer (~422.59 cents).</p><p>Note that this leaves open the question of possible affinities between<br/>these two different approaches; my point is to emphasize that they are<br/>conceptually distinct.</p><p>In Kornerup&apos;s Phi-based tuning, we get near-pure thirds and slightly<br/>impure fifths (as in any meantone tuning in this portion of the spectrum);<br/>in Pepper&apos;s Phi-based tuning, we get near-pure fifths and relatively (but<br/>not maximally) complex thirds, as with other neo-Gothic tunings in this<br/>portion of the spectrum. Incidentally, the latter tuning also gives a<br/>minor sixth very close to the somewhat-simple ratio of 11:7, with either<br/>Pythagorean tuning of 17-tET appearing somewhat more &quot;complex.&quot;</p><p>Most respectfully,</p><p>Margo Schulter<br/><a href="mailto:mschulter@value.net">mschulter@value.net</a></p></div><h3><a id=14272 href="#14272">ðŸ”—</a>Joseph Pehrson &#x3C;pehrson@pubmedia.com&#x3E;</h3><span>10/11/2000 7:47:46 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@egroups.com">tuning@egroups.com</a>, &quot;M.
