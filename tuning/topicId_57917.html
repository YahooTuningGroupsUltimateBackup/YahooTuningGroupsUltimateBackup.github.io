He also had a<br/>singer in the Diamanda Galas school who belted out tremendous<br/>absurdities that I appreciated.  Bravo Chris.</p><p>I also very much liked Marcus Bittencourt&apos;s _Bathyscaphe_ which he<br/>played at a *ring modulated* piano.  When have we heard *THAT* sound<br/>since Stockhausen&apos;s terrific _Mantra_?!  He also had a great<br/>electronic track that sounded like Gabrielli or some brass band going<br/>amuck.
