So I sprudeled out an example, using 22 MOS of 41.</p><p>I added two pitches from 41 to round out to a easier-to-use 24 and try to avoid the flat-footed pseudo-tempering to which I earlier referred. Still there wound up an instance of the Pythagorean third masquerading as the 6/5, which is going with the flow of the MOS but still irks me. No biggy though, the point of the example is made, in the first few seconds in fact.</p><p><a href="http://soundcloud.com/cameron-bobro/magical-thinking">http://soundcloud.com/cameron-bobro/magical-thinking</a></p></div>
