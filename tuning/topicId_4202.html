I really believe<br/>&gt;that the examples makes it pretty clear .</p><p>Yes, ultimately they do.  I neglected to clarify that I did eventually come<br/>to understand the point of that paper.  But I was pointing it out as an<br/>example of some particularly thick language.  I have actually been playing<br/>with the first example cycle based on the enharmonic scale, but adapted<br/>into 22ET.  (This may blunt some intonational subtleties, but hopefully<br/>retains the basic point of the modulations.)</p><p>&gt;The statement conveys that Wilson hears that urge in tetrachord scales to<br/>modulate to develop themselves. Just as other scales develop by cycle of<br/>5ths.Both have happened in the mid-east and his knowledge of this might be<br/>the fountainhead behind it. He is quite conservative in his speculation in<br/>that much of his work is based on historical examples and practice.</p><p>When reading his papers I have been curious how much of it is observation<br/>of the patterns of actual ethnic musics and how much is his speculation of<br/>where it *could* be taken.  Are there recorded examples somewhere of<br/>tetrachordal scales modulating in this way in actual music -- either ethnic<br/>musics or Wilson-influenced?</p><p>&gt;He shows actual scales analogs (Todi, Purvi, and Marwa and how these<br/>scales can be modulated one to the other and/or the way they might have<br/>developed by it &quot;inertia&quot; in a culture that doesn&apos;t modulate.</p><p>Are those names of specific raga scales?

Its use is<br/>completely obvious in ET&apos;s but much less obvious to JI.  Correct me where<br/>I&apos;m mistaken:  It appears that what you call a Constant Structure is a set<br/>of just pitches in which any particular interval is always subtended by the<br/>same number of steps.  (e.g. in a 22-tone structure a 6/5 might always be 6<br/>steps, a 3/2 always 13 steps, etc.  But 6 or 13 steps might not necessarily<br/>always be a 6/5 or 3/2...)  The &quot;3 22-tone scales&quot; you have posted would be<br/>Constant Structures, right?  Or the 17-tone Pythagorean/skhismatic scale in<br/>the &quot;Basic Patterns in Genus 12 and 17&quot;?  (Also, what is the definition of<br/>Genus?)  Once the N degrees of a Constant Structure are defined it can be<br/>used pretty much interchangeably with an N-ET scale, as far as taking<br/>different MOS scales from it?  But in JI, the resulting two steps (L and S)<br/>will only be equal in number of scale degrees, not necessarily really<br/>equal.  Is all this correct or am I confused anywhere?</p><p>kp</p></div><h3>Kraig Grady &#x3C;kraiggrady@xxxxxxxxx.xxxx&#x3E;</h3><span>8/7/1999 1:45:53 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Kris!<br/>    comments below!</p><p>Kris Peck wrote:</p><p>&gt; When reading his papers I have been curious how much of it is observation<br/>&gt; of the patterns of actual ethnic musics and how much is his speculation of<br/>&gt; where it *could* be taken.

Even in there pop music i hear these modulations<br/>all the time, usually at the entrance of a new instrument. Erlander&apos;s Musique<br/>Arabe is filled with page after page of transcriptions showing these type of<br/>things. I think that Erv speculates in which these way these scales &quot;could&quot; be<br/>taken. But in the most conservative way. I don&apos;t think any of the Persian<br/>theorist would have objected to them.

He includes them to show his tie with the past and with real scales in<br/>the real world, even if it it is by analogs! That a scale has developed and<br/>survived though eons is enough for Erv to realize that any theroy has to<br/>accomadate them. Why they have is a question that is unanswerable. They are<br/>enigmas that we can only to point to certain aspects of and build upon,  There<br/>will always be levels that we can only intuit.</p><p>&gt; I never did figure out why the<br/>&gt; papers are titled after them and why there are little &quot;Todi&quot;, etc. labels<br/>&gt; on the diagrams.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;Once again if you don&apos;t understand something ask and I will try to explain<br/>&gt;  what  I know about it.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Thanks!<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Also, since the topic is coming up again in another thread, could you<br/>&gt; expand a little more on the application of MOS to JI scales?
