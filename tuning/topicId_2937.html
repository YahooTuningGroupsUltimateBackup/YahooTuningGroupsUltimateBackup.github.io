From what I understand, &quot;The Real FZ Book&quot;<br/>isn&apos;t thought of very highly in the Zappa family circle, FWIW. Had the<br/>pleasure of at least meeting FZ at a Partch performance back in 1976 (Don<br/>Ellis was backstage, too). I think he appreciated Partch&apos;s spirit and<br/>self-reliance more than his music (and theory).</p><p>And as for that original LP that Z picked up to hear Varese for the first<br/>time, I&apos;ve got a copy. Raw but exciting.</p><p>Serialism<br/>---------</p><p>Frankly, I can count the number of serially generated pieces I like on one<br/>... appendage. That&apos;s just me, but without documentation and presented<br/>papers, I&apos;d wager that the serialist &apos;experiment&apos; may have done more to<br/>alienate listeners in the 20th century to music of their time than any<br/>other &apos;experiment&apos;. What I find fascinating is the ability for some to be<br/>so interested in returning to tuning in harmony with nature (JI) and then<br/>sit around and tweak the sucker with formulas.</p><p>Real mad scientist stuff, if you ask me, which you didn&apos;t. Hell, I&apos;m just<br/>getting over the correlation between years of Paul Erlich&apos;s posts of<br/>numbers galore and my new-found picture of him playing sweaty blues!</p><p>List-stuff<br/>----------</p><p>Pat said the following:<br/>&gt;Ray you seem to find that alot around here people addressing everything BUT<br/>&gt;the point you<br/>&gt;are interested in,mind that spelling and trim those replies though!<br/>&gt;The point being<br/>&gt;We should not compromise at all.</p><p>Well, time on Earth is precious, and I hate having mine wasted. I enjoy<br/>hearing views and opinions from many sources, but if they are cluttered,<br/>chaotic and incomprehensible then my time has been wasted. In this respect,<br/>I don&apos;t compromise. I came across a fairly clear article on improving a<br/>list&apos;s signal-to-noise ratio, if anyone cares:</p><p>&lt;<a href="http://db.tidbits.com/getbits.acgi?tbart=05386">http://db.tidbits.com/getbits.acgi?tbart=05386</a>&gt;</p><p>Reading carefully crafted, focused posts is a very corporeal experience for<br/>me.</p><p>Cheers,<br/>Jon<br/>..... . . . . . . . .  .  .  .  .  .  .  . . . . . . . . .....<br/>Jonathan M.
