I just couldn&apos;t get the umlaut to happen in an<br/>&gt; e-mail. J</p><p>fine!</p><p>&gt;&gt; Ibo: Btw, with Gr&ouml;ningen (GrOEningen) we are sometimes leaving<br/>&gt;&gt; now the North German area to the &quot;middle-German&quot; Thuringian<br/>&gt;&gt; and Saxon tradition, which - in a few documented examples -<br/>&gt;&gt; turned earlier to well-temperaments and equal temperament.</p><p>&gt; JR: And of course &quot;equal temperament&quot; is a well-temperament.</p><p>There are different opinions about that, already in history<br/>But I would agree from a mere practical standpoint.</p><p>Historically we have to research it for every single author and<br/>make clear as much as possible what exactly he is talking about.</p><p>Systematically, I would prefer to make a difference between<br/>temperaments like<br/>- meantone,<br/>- (may be) modified meantone,<br/>- well-temperaments with<br/>   - regular comma-divisions<br/>   - irregular comma-parts<br/>   - irregular distribution of regular comma divisions</p><p>Then of course the differenciation of the purpose has to come.</p><p>In this case - Werckmeister for example:<br/>He designed his (today) best known temperament (W III) with<br/>1/4-p.comma division not as the one and only temperament,<br/>gernerally to be used,  but for the irregular modes or the &quot;Genus<br/>Chromaticum&quot;.  On the other hand for the regular modes or &quot;Genus<br/>Diatonicum&quot; he designed his 3rd-p.comma based suggestion - both<br/>side to side to be found in his &quot;Musicalische Temperatur&quot; 1691, p.<br/>77 ff.).<br/>Btw, on page 79-81, he takes the effort to describe only more<br/>exact this 3rd-p.comma-temperament - and nopt the W III. And he<br/>notes that, since the beat(rate)s usually are not hit right<br/>easily, one has to correct until it sounds tolerabel (whatever<br/>that might be) - he was a practitioner, too, knowing that his<br/>systems were just one suggestion among other possibilities.</p><p>Anyway, if Werckmeister designs his temperaments differently for<br/>different purposes, - here according to the modes -  how could we<br/>say that only W III might be more apt, except when arguing not<br/>from any (historical) evidence but from mere personal preference,<br/>or &quot;experiences&quot;, which were back then as indivdual as today -<br/>meaningles for analysis of the actual status of an historic organ.</p><p>&gt;  The trend of &quot;unequal temperament&quot; in a circle of keys seems<br/>&gt; to have skipped Nederland,</p><p>yes, but not without one or the other exception - even in the beginning of the 1800s I have one example of a Ducth report,<br/>speaking of Kirnberger&apos;s temperament (probably K III)</p><p>&gt; but not Thuringia and Anhalt-Sachsen, and parts of Saxony,<br/>&gt; Hamburg, and Lubeck.</p><p>My English is may be not good enough (my &quot;old German&quot; works better<br/>:-)   Do I understand you</p><p>a)<br/>the trend towards (of) well-temwell skipped Thuringia,<br/>Sachsen-Anhalt and parts of Saxony, as well as it skipped Hamburg<br/>an L&uuml;beck</p><p>or b)<br/>The trend towards (of) well skipped Thuringia, Sachsen-Anhalt<br/>but *not* parts of Saxony, as well as it skipped Hamburg an L&uuml;beck</p><p>Both I can&apos;t be claimed</p><p>In Thuringia and Saxony we have a few documented examples of an<br/>earlier developing well-tempered<br/>In Sachsen-Anhalt we have the example from Werckmeisters direct<br/>influence - only reported only in Gr&ouml;ningen and Quedlinburg (there<br/>unspecific) - however in the big cities like Magdeburg organs were<br/>tuned in meantone in Werckmeisters time, being retuned only way<br/>after his death (1706)</p><p>&gt;&gt; Ibo: (After lengthy examples of his own&acirc;&euro;&brvbar;) What is your material?</p><p>&gt; JR: Beginning with a Columbia University Masters thesis<br/>&gt; called &quot;Bach&apos;s Tuning,&quot; I have made 5 visits to Germany,<br/>&gt; the last 4 to study the world of Bach and to eventually<br/>&gt; write a book called Bach&apos;s Tuning.</p><p>&gt; To that effect, I<br/>&gt; have performed or produced numerous Bach works in numerous<br/>&gt; tunings, always to  prefer Werckmeister III for musical<br/>&gt; reasons.  As a musician, I believe the music reveals<br/>&gt; more than the book readings that musicologists are most<br/>&gt; sensitive to.</p><p>I appreciate your musicianship.  But what exactly do you need the<br/>ttravels then for, if you already from your excellence as musician<br/>believe to be able to draw conclusions about the history of<br/>temperament practice?<br/>As many others I also have my musical experiences and preferences<br/>derived from that: From nearly 3 decades of making music - up to<br/>solistic ensemble music (which I had to stop beginning of the 90s<br/>due to other obligations), but also as a professional harpsichord<br/>tuner for concerts or on recordings (s. my work for the Tomkins<br/>complete keyboard works with Bernhard Klapprott on MDG or MD &amp; G,<br/>4 CDs - 3 of which I tuned for).</p><p>As a musician I believe, that we can&apos;t get enough histoorical<br/>information - and then make an artistic decision when it comes to<br/>the performance.  Usually we have only a fraction of the knowledge<br/>of a specific historic situation  or historic condition. It can&apos;t be expressed in numbers, but as a magnitude or proportion, one<br/>reasonably will not exceed more than 1% of the total necessary<br/>knowledge.  This means that in the magnitude of 99 % &quot;modern&quot;<br/>thoughts, prejudices and preferences will come into any<br/>performance, making any performance automatically a modern<br/>performance.<br/>At the same time this makes performance always &quot;artistic&quot;, beyond<br/>science or scientific consideration. In other words: I don&apos;t want<br/>to hear experiments (which I&apos;m interested as scientist), but I&apos;m<br/>interested in the artistic result (as musician, music lover).</p><p>But from that small and vague perfomance basis a valid judgement<br/>or an evaluation of a previous historical situation can not be<br/>drawn.  Not even for temperaments.</p><p>&gt;  I don&apos;t mean to offend, but there is seldom<br/>&gt; a day that goes by when I am not still shocked that a<br/>&gt; musicologist has missed the boat on something that is<br/>&gt; &quot;obvious&quot; to certain musicians (and, of course, certain<br/>&gt; musicologists).</p><p>I don&apos;t care whether someone calls himself or is regarded as a<br/>musician, a musicologist, or whatever - as long as s/he supports<br/>arguments by evidence and not by his/her preference.  As it comes<br/>to history, arguments have to be based on historical sources.<br/>Personal preferences for example for a certain temperament are by<br/>definition no evidence - except for the individual, who brings it<br/>forward.</p><p>And as a musically and musicologically educated person, I&apos;m daily<br/>wondering (not being shocked anymore, because it is so normal)<br/>that musicians take their emotional and half-knowledge as basis to<br/>judge and draw conclusions about history.<br/>I do hope, however, of course that you don&apos;t do so - as you are<br/>also doing musicological research and being a musician.</p><p>Research and modern musical practice should be helping other. But<br/>research is there to put forward the evidence and to - as much as<br/>possible - clarify, verify and objectify knowledge. It is not the<br/>tool for defending personal preferences or even worse, prejudices, though frequently abused to do so.<br/>Researchers in musicology might make findings, which contradict<br/>modern views on performance - might even contradict the new myths<br/>of historical informed performance (HIP) practice, even generally<br/>held views, on topics, of which everyone seems to know the contrary.<br/>I&apos;m certainly an ardent representant of HIP, but (deriving from<br/>Adorno&apos;s famous title) I think it is necessary to &quot;defend&quot; HIP<br/>&quot;against its devotees&quot; - by collecting and constantly widening<br/>knowledge. We don&apos;t need believers in the field who don&apos;t want to<br/>see evidence contradicting them, but we need knowledgeable people who.<br/>Temperament is one field of building historical myths, others are<br/> also fields of mixing individual (historical and modern)<br/>preferences to find explanatory systems, which please us so much<br/>nowadays: &quot;key characteristics&quot;, &quot;rhetorics&quot; and &quot;affects&quot; - and<br/>tempi.</p><p>&gt;&gt;&gt; As you said, you don&apos;t need to bring Werckmeister into your<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt;dissertation.<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt;I would hate to upset your track to graduation. ;)</p><p>&gt;&gt; Ibo: Thanks for the concern - just wonder why I should not<br/>&gt;&gt; know, what belongs to my diss. topic or not.</p><p>&gt; JR: Now, I don&apos;t think you mean to get sarcastic, not with<br/>&gt; so many nice and  juicy fact morsels below.  If you check<br/>&gt; above, I have used an ironic icon to indicate that I am<br/>&gt; not being &quot;earnestly&quot; serious.</p><p>OK, I didn&apos;t know that sign - only one of the many misprints in<br/>our mails.  I appreciate good irony and humour, but it is in a<br/>multi-lingual surrounding with non-english-speakers like me<br/>probably my fault that I don&apos;t get all nuances. May be better to<br/>be very clear.</p><p>&gt; &Atilde;&tilde; However, there are other sources. Have you checked</p><p>&gt;&gt;Werckmeister&apos;s own report of 1705 about the Groningen<br/>&gt;&gt;temperament change? It has just been published<br/>&gt;&gt;in English.</p><p>&gt;&gt; [Didn&apos;t find it - can you provide us with the bibliographical data)</p><p>&gt;&gt; I can only hope that the translators didn&apos;t mess it up further<br/>&gt;&gt; about (wrong) GrOningen, instead of (right) Gr&Atilde;&ndash;ningen.</p><p>&gt; JR: Krieger, Marcos Fernando.

Still some sentences, words might not be<br/>&gt;&gt; understood at all. I always wonder how much translators are<br/>&gt;&gt; aware  about things like this.

Mainz 1932.</p><p>&gt; JR: Thank you.  I have both, thanks to a recent visit<br/>&gt; to Indiana University Library.  You are quite right<br/>&gt; about reading Werckmeister&apos;s German.  Mizler<br/>&gt; and Huygens and Rasch have criticized Werckmeister&apos;s<br/>&gt; &quot;bad&quot; German.</p><p>W.&apos;s German is not that bad or funny.<br/>Authors have often failed to see that a local and colloquial use of language might differ from other standards.  People from other<br/>regions and/or eras like Huygens (Dutch, 17th century), Mizler<br/>(German 18th century) Rasch (German?, Dutch 20th century) might<br/>not see that socio- and historical-liinguistic fact.</p><p>&gt; However, I had the good fortune to stay with Herr Lichtwitz<br/>&gt; of the great library in Wolfenbuttal</p><p>this is Wolfenbuettel (better: Wolfenb&uuml;ttel)<br/>the famous Herzog-August-Bibliothek,</p><p>&gt; while making one of my travels.  His wife Vertrude</p><p>Is really &apos;Vertrude&apos; her name?</p><p>&gt; was native to this area</p><p>in which the use of language since Werckmeister has changed<br/>significantly,</p><p>&gt; and good easily translate aloud in almost real time.</p><p>which I won&apos;t doubt.</p><p>&gt; She found Werckmeister&apos;s writing - and I concurred - funny<br/>&gt; and erudite.<br/>&gt; There were many double entendres and &quot;paradoxes.&quot;</p><p>&gt;&gt; Ibo: Werckmeister does not specify any precise temperament<br/>&gt;&gt; to which that organ had been retuned. However he mentions<br/>&gt;&gt; only precisely that the organ was tuned before in the &quot;old,<br/>&gt;&gt; so called Praetorian&quot; temperament (i. e. meantone)</p><p>&gt; JR: Wasn&apos;t it his pride to write things up because his<br/>&gt; temperament was chosen?  Why else?</p><p>Yes of course, because as he himself stated in print 1697, that<br/>the organ builders are so stubborn and don&apos;t follow his new<br/>temperament suggestions. Which he by the way constantly changed,<br/>added, admitted change, corrections tec. from book to book which<br/>he published.</p><p>&gt; &Atilde;&tilde; Werckmeister doesn&apos;t mention other people enough (everyone</p><p>&gt;&gt;he does mention is listed in Walther&apos;s Lexicon).</p><p>&gt;&gt; Ibo: The retuning in Gr&ouml;ningen which Werckmeister<br/>&gt;&gt; vaguely describes was a single case, not representative<br/>&gt;&gt; at all for the temperament practice. Not even in W.&apos;s region<br/>&gt;&gt; - as several known examples up to the late 1730s show.</p><p>&gt; JR: So here, you seem to accept the logic of a single<br/>&gt; case.  We must take one at a time.</p><p>that is what I&apos;m doing mainly - taking one organ examination<br/>report after the other, or other documents (archival or<br/>transcribed in publication or printed descriptions of actual<br/>organs and therir temperaments).<br/>And I can assure you not one single of the cases (for the time and<br/>areas I&apos;m researching in) the well-tempered assumtions of modern<br/>researches could withstand the documented evidence.</p><p>&gt; For me, it is with Bach that I can begin to check other<br/>&gt; cases.</p><p>and for me it is the organs, which were not just retuned, because<br/>even a Bach came along for a visit.</p><p>&gt; There is a logic in using Werckmeister III in his music<br/>&gt; that I will attempt to expose sometime soon.  I am sorry,<br/>&gt; I must disagree with some of your assumptions about<br/>&gt; Central German churches and their temperament.</p><p>You are welcome, if you can base your assumtions on evidence and<br/>not only on your convictions or beliefs - however respeectful they<br/>may be from a modern performance view.</p><p>&gt; There are more churches per square inch in this area than<br/>&gt; anywhere on earth, and so many church organs where a<br/>&gt; chromatacist as Bach</p><p>Let me guess for once: Bach certainly would disagree with this<br/>categorization.</p><p>&gt; could be welcomed.</p><p>Of course he would be welcomed - and he would have to take what<br/>was available.</p><p>&gt;&gt; Ibo: In the North the same development starts and can be seen<br/>&gt;&gt; between ca. 1760-1830 (+- 20 years) - since it came so late<br/>&gt;&gt; in the North, Werckmeister&apos;s ideas came often &quot;too late&quot;<br/>&gt;&gt; for retuning the still meantone organ - most often we can<br/>&gt;&gt; find indications of retunings from meantone directly<br/>&gt;&gt; into ET (with all the organ building problems I sketched<br/>&gt;&gt; above)</p><p>&gt; JR: The above is true in Holland, yes: but not Thuringia.</p><p>What are your statistics for Thuringia. You just correctly stated<br/>that the area is crowded with churches in many smaller and greater<br/>places. Of how many exactly do you have any evidence about the<br/>status of the organ in Bach&apos;s lifetime 1685-1750?</p><p>&gt; Werckmeister was not &quot;too late.&quot;</p><p>I meant his several temperament suggestions, which came so &quot;late&quot;,<br/>that they often were overrun instead by (intended) Equal temperament.</p><p>&gt;  He was early.  His first publication was 1681 (the year<br/>&gt; Telemann was born in Magdeburg (which had been completely<br/>&gt; destroyed in 1631 by the Thirty-years War).</p><p>Thanks, I know these facts well and the Magdeburg-case - a real<br/>war crime - played a role in my research on Matthias Weckman[n]&apos;s<br/>biography (s. references in the new edition of the New Grove)</p><p>&gt; Before he was to publish in Quedlinburg he travelled&acirc;&euro;&brvbar;.even<br/>&gt; to Amsterdam.</p><p>No,<br/>at least if you didn&apos;t find evidence for that in some archive -<br/>that would be really exciting!</p><p>As the conference-reports from the Werckmeister-Kolloquium 1985<br/>(published in Michaelstein, 1986) and Rudolf Rasch&apos;s research (in<br/>his facsimile edition of the &quot;Musicalische Temperatur&quot; Utrecht,<br/>1983) showed there is no journey to Amsterdam known, nor indicated<br/>somewhere.<br/>I think yo mix the information up:<br/>Werckmeister&apos;s second enlarged edition (1698) of his &quot;Orgelprobe&quot;<br/>(first, 1681), the edition Leipzig 1754  got translated into<br/>Dutch.  It was published namely in Amsterdam, and is the only<br/>connection of Werckmeister to the Dutch capital<br/>By the way, that was 48 years after Werckmeister&apos;s death. I think<br/>that is really a dead link.</p><p>Translator was Jacob Wilhelm Lustig (*1706 in Hamburg,<br/>Werckmeisters&apos; death year). After grwon up in the meantone Hamburg<br/>he became organist at the large (meantone) Schnitger-organ in<br/>GrOningen (Netherlands).  tchaaa, and he became a proponent of<br/>equal temperament, at first for ensemble music, later 1760s even<br/>for organs - as the documents from Vlissingen show clearly. The<br/>rather close time coincidence with the ET-retuning in Alkmaar 1765<br/>is tempting to think that he might have been involved in the<br/>background - but no evidence at all points to that! (But wiith<br/>personal preferences others might easily conclude that, too)<br/>In his Dutch translation Lustig  substantially enlarged and<br/>annotated the text, to adapt it to the contemporary Dutch<br/>situation, most likely even showing Lustig&apos;s wish to influence it.<br/>There is a facsimile available, Baarn: de Praestantpers, 1968</p><p>&gt; And he likely spoke Dutch!</p><p>Sorry can&apos;t help - as W&apos;s German is assumed to be so terrible, why<br/>should he try to spoil Dutch, too - especially when he probably<br/>didn&apos;t get there?</p><p>&gt; He was a Johnny<br/>&gt; Appleseed of tuning ideas he had called a natural consequence<br/>&gt; of Praetorian quarter-comma meantone.  He doesn&apos;t claim to<br/>&gt; originate the idea, not does he name it.</p><p>Which idea? Meantone -temperament? He couldn&apos;t claim that, since<br/>it was in use before Praetorius 1619, and before Zqarlino&apos;s<br/>description in 1571 and before Pietro A(a)ron and before Ramis de<br/>Parejas practical description in 1482.</p><p>&gt; In fact we don&apos;t have a face to put on him.</p><p>[Probably people today would think it to be funny, too, like his<br/>language]</p><p>&gt;&gt;The organ builder Wender of Muhlhausen preferred to use<br/>&gt;&gt;Werckmeister&apos;s tuning.</p><p>&gt; Ibo: Nothing proves that - It is an assumption on shiny chronological<br/>&gt; and geographical coincidences</p><p>&gt; JR: It is musicology.</p><p>No, bad methods occur in any science - actually often they can&apos;t<br/>be considered to be science, but novel writing.</p><p>&gt; &Atilde;&tilde; Ahle, Bach&apos;s predecessor in Muhlhausen, was indeed friends</p><p>&gt;&gt;with W. (including things about W. in his prose and<br/>&gt;&gt;voluminous writings). It would appear</p><p>&gt; It would, yes, and might appear so to some.<br/>&gt; But the historical documents available until now on Wender do not<br/>&gt; back up the assumptions enough, to conclude which exact temperament<br/>&gt; he might have used.</p><p>&gt; JR: As I read it, you are endorsing a very conservative view,</p><p>On the contrary: Since my view is obviously new and people are<br/>getting stirred up from their comfy well-tempered chairs, I would<br/>consider the results of my (largely unpublished research, of which<br/>I give here a glance) as brand new.  Of course I relyo many others<br/>valuable and respected research - in that, however, I&apos;m truly<br/>conservative.</p><p>&gt; one that misattributes the influence of Andreas Werckmeister<br/>&gt; on early German music.</p><p>Your evidence please for this assumtion, on what I do.</p><p>&gt; There was no one before Werckmeister to present a tuning<br/>&gt; that would do what was musically necessary.</p><p>No, since professional musicians and organ builders advocated<br/>meantone temperaments before, in the time and past  Werckmeister,<br/>they were not just nuts.</p><p>Take the differenciating view of the Bremen cDom (cathedral)<br/>organist Grave  who advocated 1755 for keeping the meantone<br/>temperament in the (Schnitger)-organ, because it is better for the<br/> liturgical function the organ, though he says that he would<br/>prefer ET for accompanying the ensemble music (a pattern of<br/>argument, which we find in Mattheson&apos;s and other writer&apos;s<br/>publications already around 1730). However he states, that the<br/>ensemble music is not as important issue in his church, so the<br/>&quot;Praetorian&quot; temperament should be kept.  The organ was retuned 20<br/>years later - direct to ET!  (A bunch of similar cases and<br/>arguments are known to me).</p><p>How would we &quot;characterize&quot; Mr. Grave:<br/>- &quot;conservative&quot; because he let&apos;s the meantone temperament<br/>   stay in the organ, since it serves well the required<br/>   or recognized function (in the liturgy)<br/>- &quot;progressive&quot; as he propses equal temperament for ensemble<br/>   music accompaniment<br/>- &quot;moderate&quot;, &quot;opportunistic&quot; or &quot;functional&quot; as he judges in<br/>   general from the function of the organ</p><p>Our modern political labels &quot;conservative&quot; etc.  may remain in the<br/>drawers, for my part.</p><p>&gt;  In some likelihood, Bach&apos;s uncle Johann Christoph Bach<br/>&gt; may have had one of those &quot;bumps&quot; into the 3-year younger<br/>&gt; Werckmeister.</p><p>&gt; And Christoph spoke Dutch as well!</p><p>If you referred here to the unproven and unlikely knowledge of<br/>Dutch of  Werckmeister -&gt; s. above.</p><p>&gt;<br/>&gt; &Atilde;&tilde; that Bach walked into an already tuned Werckmeister</p><p>&gt;&gt; Ibo: Nothing is known, which sufficiently would confirm<br/>&gt;&gt; this or support it.<br/>&gt;&gt; Do you know what the examination reports from these<br/>&gt;&gt; organ specify about the temperament?</p><p>&gt; JR: Have you never heard the difference between<br/>&gt; equal tempered Buxtehude and Werckmeister III tuned<br/>&gt; Buxtehude?  It is night and day.</p><p>Hear hear!  I tuned these myself frequently, and with some pieces<br/>W III gives a fine result, with others even ET works, others again<br/>don&apos;t reject a Vallotti ...  Some work in every surrounding.</p><p>Plus, the voicing, registration and the room can do incredible<br/>much to lead astray even experiencesd people.</p><p>So what could we gain from our today&apos;s listening experience -<br/>where we already do not agree.

No less</p><p>&gt;&gt;than Kuhnau spoke of Wender&apos;s insistence on Werckmeister<br/>&gt;&gt;tuning.</p><p>&gt; Ibo: Please provide a reference for this: when did Kuhnau<br/>&gt; state this, and which exactly of Werckmeister&apos;s several<br/>&gt; temperaments does he refer to?</p><p>&gt; JR: It is from the Bach-archiv article you referenced.<br/>&gt; And since Sorge and others have credited Werckmeister&apos;s<br/>&gt; third listing is his actual favorite, this is<br/>&gt; historically the better choice.</p><p>No - as there is no historical evidence for that, it can&apos;t prove<br/>the historical validity.</p><p>I have taken contact to Markus Rathey by the way and sent him my<br/>concerns about his article - we had some mail exchange on that and<br/>he is still thinking about it.</p><p>He convinced himself of his assumtions to become &quot;facts&quot; in the<br/>course of the article.

But they can&apos;t consistently be<br/>performed by free intonating musicians as exact to the pitches<br/>created by the well-temperament in a fixed-pitch-instrument like a<br/>keyboard instrument.</p><p>And the effect of any temperament is and should be masked by the<br/>continuo-group, which to this aim should consist of several<br/>additional bass instruments, like a Viollone, Gamba or caello,<br/>Dulcian or Fagotto, etc.  In this way it is better guaranteed,<br/>that the disturbing impure chords* from the keyboard instruments<br/>will not destroy the pure flexible intonation required from the non-continuo-players (and singers)</p><p>*in Werckmeister already A-major is a theiretically a schisma<br/>worse than the ET-A-major, not to speak of B-major oor A-flat-major</p><p>&gt;  I had to announce to the<br/>&gt; audience that it is quite interesting that the identifying<br/>&gt; name of Werckmeister with tuning was so conservative<br/>&gt; in his actual use of pitch relationships.</p><p>I don&apos;t grasp the story. If your singers and players would have<br/>performed in the way descrived by numerous authors of the 17 and<br/>18th century, your audience should not be able to detect what<br/>temperament the keybaord instrument has, as the other musicians<br/>should play as pure as possible (above the lowest sooounding note)<br/>and the rest of the continuo should be loud enough to mask the bad<br/>chords...</p><p>&gt; Ibo: Kuhnau worked in Leipzig, - around 1700 this was<br/>&gt; scarcely related to the - quite different - organ building<br/>&gt; practice of Northern Germany which I&apos;m researching.</p><p>&gt; JR: Maybe, but Kuhnau had the same basic interests as<br/>&gt; Werckmeister&acirc;&euro;&brvbar;and they  were likely friends as well.</p><p>Obviously all were &quot;friends&quot; who lived in the same time.<br/>I give up on this part. I am sorry: If you can&apos;t prove something,<br/>then don&apos;t think that by repeting it, it will get a better likeliness.</p><p>&gt;&gt; Ibo: If you can show the evidence for your statement<br/>&gt;&gt; by any reference, then it would point to a significant<br/>&gt;&gt; change in Kuhnau&apos;s position towards temperament: in<br/>&gt;&gt; 1717 he complains to Mattheson in a letter about the<br/>&gt;&gt; organ builder&apos;s Wender&apos;s and Silbermann&apos;s temperament<br/>&gt;&gt; practice, that they do not use the &quot;exact temperament&quot;<br/>&gt;&gt; of Neidhart (i. e. ET, as Neidhart specified it, from<br/>&gt;&gt; his other suggestions).</p><p>&gt; JR:  Thanks.  This is as good as saying: Wender is in<br/>&gt; Werckmeister&apos;s chromatic tuning.</p><p>Be my guest to think free what you make up from my statements:  I<br/>did not say that and the available data allow not to conclude<br/>anything like that!</p><p>I can&apos;t help, if you let your preference steer your belief,<br/>instead being guided by your scientific education and accepted<br/>methods of rational arguing.</p><p>&gt;&gt; Ibo: And the Silbermann researcher Frank Harald Gress<br/>&gt;&gt; pointed to Silbermann&apos;s usual application of some form<br/>&gt;&gt; of meantone temperament (probably 1/4-comma-meantone, or<br/>&gt;&gt; very close) in Silbermann&apos;s earlier decades (the later<br/>&gt;&gt; statement from Sorge about a 1/6-komma-temperament, must<br/>&gt;&gt; be seen in the biased light of the &quot;Temperaturen-Streit&quot;<br/>&gt;&gt; of the later 18th century! Sorge&apos;s description can&apos;t<br/>&gt;&gt; simply be taken literally for Silbermann&apos;s practice,<br/>&gt;&gt; as confirmed by other documents).</p><p>&gt; JR: Everyone is biased and no one is biased.  How can<br/>&gt; you disregard whom you like and whom you do not?  Now<br/>&gt; we believe Sorge, now we disbelieve Werckmeister: now,<br/>&gt; we reverse.</p><p>Whether someone is biased or not, has to be discussed by evidence.<br/>It is about making the case. Take the &quot;facts&quot; check and double<br/>check them, explain their prerequiites, contradictions, prove as<br/>much as possile their point or disprove it. It has nothing to do<br/>with like or dislike.<br/>I don&apos;t know Sorge, nor Werckmeister personally - I have no<br/>preference to the one or other. Both were incredibly skilled<br/>people with good judgement. What they write has a ground, an aim<br/>and a purpose: bias.<br/>What we have are their writings, some letters, or other info.<br/>Then we have the info from the organs themselves, the reports<br/>(often signed by several examinators, because the churches wanted<br/>to be sure not to be betrayed - these reports are nearly always<br/>critical to the point (agianst the organ builder), mentioning,<br/>critisizing or indicating temperaments etc.<br/>What would that have to to with bias, etc</p><p>&gt; The musicology means little if after reading a big book<br/>&gt; one can only say it is all gook.</p><p>Which I didn&apos;t say.</p><p>&gt; Ibo: Whatever temperament Wender actually might have applied,<br/>&gt; is not known or documented to my knowledge. The recent<br/>&gt; Bach-Jahrbuch article by Marcus</p><p>Sorry, my fault: Markus<br/>And the article is<br/>Die Temperierung der Divi Blasii-Orgel in M&uuml;hlhausen.<br/>BachJb, 87 (2001), 163-171</p><p>&gt; Rathey unfortunately creates<br/>&gt; the impression from mere chronological and geographical<br/>&gt; coincidences and reasoning, without any proof and double<br/>&gt; checks from the organ&apos;s history.</p><p>&gt; JR: I will have to go back to Rathey to quote him, but I<br/>&gt; remember his having particular statements by Kuhnau and<br/>&gt; Ahle, connecting Wender to Werckmeister&apos;s tuning.</p><p>Exactly:  HIS (Rathey&apos;s 2001) statements connecting Wender and<br/>Werckmeister...</p><p>&gt; Ibo: And once same old soup again here, too: How much does<br/>&gt; an assumed friendship between Ahle and Werckmeister tell<br/>&gt; about Wender&apos;s (not documented) actual organ temperament<br/>&gt; in M&uuml;lhausen? Nothing, of course - it is an interpretation<br/>&gt; by connecting  non-temperament-related items. May be -<br/>&gt; may be not.</p><p>&gt; JR: From where I sit, mine is the important new<br/>&gt; research, while you are sitting on the status quo.</p><p>Sure, as you have &quot;proven&quot; here with loads of your personal<br/>preference from modern performance, not to speak of unexact<br/>statements, falsifiable statements.</p><p>If this is the quality of &quot;important new research&quot; in the &quot;brave<br/>new world&quot; of &quot;new musicology&quot; - I&apos;ll give up my profession tomorrow.</p><p>I leave the judgement to the list participants ...</p><p>&gt;&gt; Ibo: For an free intonating instrument it is no advantage<br/>&gt;&gt; from another circulating temperament, since they only have<br/>&gt;&gt; to play pure above the lowest - as pure as possible: in<br/>&gt;&gt; practice that means, +-3 to  5 cents around the pure (!)<br/>&gt;&gt; interval above the lowest note, which<br/>&gt;&gt; makes for that purpose all well-temperaments<br/>&gt;&gt; marginal in difference!</p><p>&gt; JR: We play accurate to the cent whenever possible, at<br/>&gt; least in the mind.</p><p>If that is &quot;accurate&quot; as your arguments in this discussion, then<br/>the imagination of good intonation happened probably only in the<br/>minds.</p><p>&gt; The way you are discussing tuning, they all sound just<br/>&gt; about the same.</p><p>Completely wrong<br/>and by my discussing no tuning nor temperament will change, I bet.</p><p>&gt;  I do not hear that way,</p><p>That&apos;s a big problem. A piece of good advice to solve that<br/>problem, which partly spoils this whole discussion:<br/>See to educate your ear as much as possible</p><p>I have trained and exercised that for years and I hope such<br/>training will help you to improve your judgement in the future, so<br/>that you to get away from the prejudices, which conceal the<br/>historical evidence to you. You&apos;ll find a fascinating world of<br/>intonation and still can - like I do - keep some other fine<br/>prejudices for the non scientific part of our life.</p><p>&gt; nor do I suspect Buxtehude did.</p><p>You suspect to much.<br/>Scientific reasoning is very much the same like a trial When the<br/>police suspects someone, the trial serves to fid out as much as<br/>possible from the evidence, what happened. For that techniques of<br/>proof and disproof will be applied. Sometimes the court will come<br/>to the conclusion, that the evidence doesn&apos;t allow to draw a<br/>conclusion.  In a state where justice prevails the defendant is<br/>freed then. In science, however, it can only be stated, that<br/>nothing safe is known.</p><p>&gt; Nor did Bach.</p><p>Here the above suspicion &quot;&quot;I suspect Buxtehude did&quot; turned already<br/>in a factual statement &quot;Bach did&quot;.</p><p>&gt; Werckmeister is ideal in every way to fit the missing link<br/>&gt; that is Thuringia.</p><p>Well, if you think he is ideal, than make the case - your belief<br/>is no proof.</p><p>&gt;&gt; Ibo: But an organ, was of course difficult to retune. Only<br/>&gt;&gt; to convince the church Elders to pay the money, could be<br/>&gt;&gt; the first part of the work, with which a project might have<br/>&gt;&gt; failed. As I said before:  large, public payed organs,<br/>&gt;&gt; serving a function in a &quot;conservative&quot; society and<br/>&gt;&gt; liturgy were no lab for unprecedented temperament<br/>&gt;&gt; experiments, to change a ca. 250 years tradition</p><p>&gt; JR: Which is why a theologian like Werckmeister</p><p>Now you make him to something he never was: a theologian. (Read<br/>his biography in the literature on Werckmeister, s. above).<br/>No,  he was no scientist on (christian) religion,<br/>but &quot;only&quot; a believer in his God, and sometimes also argued from<br/>these his preferences and beliefs. Sounds by now familiar that you<br/>bring him into that context.</p><p>&gt; was ideally place to pave the way for well-temperament</p><p>again &quot;ideally&quot; is your unproven statement - and what the<br/>(Lutheran) church had to say to the term &quot;well-tempered&quot; is about<br/>zero.</p><p>&gt; (a term that he coined in publication as &quot;Wohl-temperirt&quot;).<br/>&gt;  The church was on his side.</p><p>Good for him. Has nothing to do with his temperaments, even less<br/>with the documented temperament practice around him.</p><p>&gt; Any examples you have to the contrary will be of great interest to us.</p><p>&gt;&gt; Ibo:  Today, tape is may be a solution - But, contradicting is, that I<br/>&gt;&gt; have not seen any good baroque oboe player doing something like<br/>&gt;&gt; that to his instrument.</p><p>&gt; JR: How about Bram Kreeftmeijer of Arnhem.  He was my oboist for<br/>&gt; Brandenburg Concerto #2&acirc;&euro;&brvbar;and he used scotch tape that I procured.</p><p>&gt;&gt; Ibo: And what kind of tape would you suggest<br/>&gt;&gt; for the practice back then? I thought it is an invention of the<br/>&gt;&gt; 20th century?</p><p>OK, But what does Mhr. Kreeftmmeijer may be useful tape-strangling<br/>of a modern oboe for your recent concert  have to do with<br/>Werckmeister&apos;s temperament, and whether it was actually applied in<br/>which organ.</p><p>&gt; JR: Back then they had no keys on oboes.  One would have used<br/>&gt; beeswax on wind instruments.  On a modern bassoon playing<br/>&gt; Johann  Michael Bach&apos;s &quot;Ach bleib,&acirc;&euro;&brvbar;<br/>&gt; .,&quot; I used tape as well: it works flawlessly.</p><p>A modern bassoon is for our discussion pointless, like the<br/>previously mentioned modern oboe. No historical reports confirm<br/>that beewax-practice in order to reach different interval sizes of<br/>well-temperaments. On the contrary, oboes (like all woodwinds)<br/>were especially required by 18th autors to play as pure as<br/>possible (to the continuo, as described above). The same authors<br/>might advocate in the same sources use of well-temperaments or<br/>even ET in te accompanying keyboard instruments</p><p>&gt;&gt; Ibo: I certainly can imagine that you were part of a great<br/>&gt;&gt; performance of concerted ensemble music, which you mention.</p><p>Obviously performed on modern instruments, thus irrelevant to the<br/>instrument-acoustical situation and practice of Werckmeister&apos;s time...</p><p>&gt;&gt; But again, how<br/>&gt;&gt; exactly could an argument be drawn from your recent<br/>&gt;&gt; performance for the historical knowledge or<br/>for<br/>&gt;&gt; narrowing  in to the temperament practice**<br/>&gt;&gt; in North German church organs from the<br/>&gt;&gt; documented evidence, as reported for example in<br/>&gt;&gt; examination and  other status reports etc.<br/>** practice, not theories, which were published, without that we<br/>know that they were practised.</p><p>&gt; JR: Your sentence above was too long for me to figure<br/>&gt; out how to respond to it.</p><p>I didn&apos;t formulate it clear, sorry. I hope it is better formulated<br/>now.</p><p>&gt; Certainly, there is plenty of room for argument&acirc;&euro;&brvbar;of one type or<br/>&gt; another.<br/>&gt; As time unravels from last weeks concerts, many revelations unwrap,<br/>&gt; sort of like an onion peal.</p><p>&gt;&gt;&gt;for all the usage of Werckmeister.</p><p>&gt;&gt; of which Walther doesn&apos;t write even a tiny bit!</p><p>&gt;&gt;&gt;He&apos;s all over the place.</p><p>&gt;&gt; Ibo: Werckmeister&apos;s name in Walther&apos;s Lexicon? Yes<br/>&gt;&gt; - but not one hint on any Werckmeister-temperament,<br/>&gt;&gt; no example of any organ thus tuned is listed by Walther.</p><p>&gt; JR: We certainly have different eyes.  I see a whole<br/>&gt; page on Werckmeister and much less on most any<br/>&gt; other personage.</p><p>I think physically our eyes are rather alike - if you only take<br/>away your persona-preference-bias-glasses ...</p><p>Walther lists on &quot;the whole page&quot; on Werckmeister the latter&apos;s<br/>publications, yes.<br/>But he doesn&apos;t describe any of W.&apos;s temperaments. Neither does he<br/>do so for any other author on temperament!</p><p>&gt;  I see Werckmeister&apos;s name listed first in the article on<br/>&gt; &quot;Temperament,&quot;</p><p>I see it too, but I see also mentioned in the same entry<br/>- Printz (whose entry get&apos;s even more than space<br/>  in the Walther&apos;s Lexikon), who was a proponent of<br/>  meantone temperament<br/>- Brossard, who evenly gets nearly a page</p><p>&gt; and I see Werckmeister&apos;s name listed to anything that<br/>&gt; Walther can find that would indeed connect.  But no,<br/>&gt; not to a specific organ.</p><p>So what? No temperament specified, no specific organ mentioned,<br/>where the reader might listen to it in 1732...</p><p>&gt; &Atilde;&tilde; And take a listen to Armin Shoof&apos;s</p><p>&gt;&gt; Schoof, the organist of the Jakobi church L&uuml;beck<br/>&gt;&gt; ... the fabulous small organ (1467/1637)</p><p>&gt;&gt;&gt;performances of Buxtehude on Lubeck&apos;s St. Jacobi Kirche.</p><p>&gt;&gt; What is your opinion:<br/>&gt;&gt; How does a (Schoof&apos;s) performance *today* tell us<br/>&gt;&gt; anything about the actual temperaments to be found<br/>&gt;&gt; in (North German) organs in Buxtehude&apos;s and<br/>&gt;&gt; Werckmeister&apos;s time?</p><p>&gt; JR: My opinion, and everyone that has heard<br/>&gt; Shoof&apos;s</p><p>really, its:  Schoof!</p><p>&gt; more recent Buxtehude album,</p><p>I got it as a personal gift from him ...</p><p>&gt; is that it is a different piece than its equal tempered<br/>&gt; manifestations.<br/>&gt; Sequences have a life that are intended for subtle<br/>&gt; comparison, totally lost in ET.<br/>&gt; People cry at the significant difference.</p><p>Hmm - I regret that. But may be transposition to other keys might<br/>help away from that crying state.  I have a bunch of printed organ<br/>teaching manuals (handbooks) and other stuff  which confirm that<br/>transposing pieces was common exercise in Buxtehude&apos;s time and<br/>area (and way beyond in time and region).</p><p>&gt; Please be sure to share this with Armin Shoof.</p><p>(Schoof again).<br/>No, share you preferences with him, if you like.<br/>I have frequent talkks with him and we agree and he understands my<br/>points very well. On his invitation I&apos;m going to present on my<br/>research there end of June.</p><p>&gt;&gt; Ibo: And even if the Werckmeister temperament would<br/>&gt;&gt; unexpectedly have been heard from the organ in St.<br/>&gt;&gt; Jakobi in around 1700 in the organ(s) in St. Jakobi,<br/>&gt;&gt; it would not mean, that the organ(s) in the<br/>&gt;&gt; neighbouring church St. Marien, where Buxtehude worked,<br/>&gt;&gt; must have had a well-temperament.</p><p>&gt; JR: When, according to the records, was the St. Jakobi<br/>&gt; kleine orgel first tuned into Werckmeister III.</p><p>In 1979, in words nineteenhundredseventynine<br/>during the previous restoration.<br/>And I have studied the L&uuml;beck archive on site (maybe in total I<br/>have spent there 2 or emore months over the past years), the<br/>historical data and the restoration documentation of that organ<br/>very well), I can promise you - and you can ask Armin S-C-hoof<br/>about it. Also the 16th to 20th century archival data of the other<br/>organs of L&uuml;beck</p><p>&gt; It is a middle ages era</p><p>In history 1467 we do not call it middle age or medieval anymore.<br/>However this layer is adressed as &quot;late gothic&quot; in the standard<br/>art history for this region.</p><p>&gt; instrument so there must be records.</p><p>most, lost - probably in WW II, or not returned frm the<br/>ex-Soviet-union.</p><p>&gt;&gt; Ibo: Since, however, nothing points to a Werckmeister<br/>&gt;&gt; temperament in L&uuml;beck-Jakobi in Buxtehude&apos;s time, this<br/>&gt;&gt; example goes to the big bulk of unlikeliness.</p><p>&gt; JR: Once again, it appears there is some disconnect<br/>&gt; here.</p><p>You might have noticed, meanwhile, that I always try to avoid to<br/>connect items, which don&apos;t show any sign of a connection. That&apos;s<br/>good scientific habit, which keeps one rather much free from<br/>disturbing own preferences ...</p><p>&gt;  One can hear the difference, though I admit it<br/>&gt; is difficult to make this clear through the<br/>&gt; internet.</p><p>I prefer real instruments from the internet, anyway.<br/>However Pierre Lewis java tuner on his website is worth a small<br/>try for people unexperienced in training their ears.</p><p>&gt; But besides the listening, which is understandably<br/>&gt; suspect to you,</p><p>can&apos;t you read?</p><p>What do you think, how I tuned the instruments for the Tomkins<br/>recording?  I do not use electronic aids, just a simple tuning fork.<br/>For concerts, teaching students in classes as I recently did when<br/>the organ class from Eastman school of Music (Rochester/NY) came<br/>here.</p><p>What do you know about my listening abilities, that you dare to<br/>state this?<br/>How do you think, I recently detected, that the composition of a<br/>high pitched composite stop (a Cimbel III)in one organ was wrong?<br/>How do you think, I came to a recently restored organ, where the<br/>organ restorer claimed wrongly that he didn&apos;t temper it to<br/>Vallotti, while I could show it to others only by ear, that he had<br/>tuned that temperament - as was statd then in a report about that<br/>organ (however that historic organ got a wrong temperament with<br/>Vallotti, whose vague suggestions never was used in that region or<br/>time!).</p><p>When you have trained your ear so that you can do similar<br/>requirements, then let us talk again.</p><p>&gt; Buxtehude wrote a poem dedicated to Werckmesiter.  It<br/>&gt; came in 1702, later than the 1691 Musicalische Temperatur.<br/>&gt;  He must have been a friend to write a stanza poem<br/>&gt; in Werckmeister&apos;s honor.  He must have been satisfied with<br/>&gt; what Werckmeister&apos;s tuning had to offer.  And he must<br/>&gt; have had the time to fully decide if it was of<br/>&gt; substantial importance to the creation of his own<br/>&gt; music.</p><p>He must this, he must that - nothing better to offer?</p><p>That he and Schnitger wrote the poems, doesn&apos;t say anything.<br/>I can praise someone for his excellence in general without<br/>acknowleding him for something, which I would think unpractical or<br/>even wrong.  We simply do not know what Buxtehude could have<br/>thought about W.&apos;s temperaments.<br/>And we don&apos;t, whether they were really &quot;friends&quot;, even if<br/>Buxtehude in his poem calls W. in the exuberant way of the time<br/>&quot;his highly esteemed friend&quot;.<br/>They exchanged an unknown number of letters, may be only one each,<br/>may be more - we don&apos;t know. And even if, nothing is known about,<br/>what and how their contact was, no content reported on B.&apos;s r W.&apos;s<br/> letters, no single hint that temperament might have been (even<br/>controversely?) discussed. Maybe the didn&apos;t agree and therefore<br/>stopped the exchange of lettres - Lots of possibilities. But<br/>nothing to conclude.</p><p>However, I pointed to the possible irony in Schnitger&apos;s poem<br/>already, which he wrote for the same volume of Werckmeister&apos;s. And<br/>it was Schnitger, whom Buxtehude wanted to carry out the<br/>renovation of the large organ in St. Marien.  This Schnitger, who<br/>did not subscribe to W.&apos;s new temperamentS, - This Schnitger, for<br/>whom in each single case only meantone temperament can be proven,<br/>was the choice for Buxtehude.  Finally, the work was carried out<br/>by Otto Diedrich Richborn from Hamburg, Schnitgers concurrence in<br/>Hamburg, where both had their workshop.Nothing points to, that<br/>Buxtehdue wanted an instrument, that would have noticebly to<br/>everyone, different than the &quot;meantone ocean&quot; around him.</p><p>&gt;&gt; Ibo: Yes, thanks - would be nice if we could see evidence<br/>&gt;&gt; from Walther, which would be really something new!</p><p>&gt; JR: When Walther wrote in a letter that &quot;Bach and Buxtehude<br/>&gt; were the &quot;only living German organists worthy of mention,&quot;<br/>&gt; it is significant.</p><p>In it self and for what it is saying, it is certainly significant,<br/>but it says once again nothing about whether and if at all, which<br/>of Werckmeister&apos;s temperaments actually were applied to organs.</p><p>&gt; Walther received his Buxtehude material directly from<br/>&gt; Werckmeister, personally, in Halberstadt.  That Bach<br/>&gt; walked to spend months with Buxtehude&apos;s music is also<br/>&gt; significant.</p><p>For what? For what temperament in which organ exactly is it<br/>significant?</p><p>&gt;  Rather than pine about what we cannot know,</p><p>As you do by guessing around on no evidence or worse on mere<br/>personal preference</p><p>&gt; why not explore what we do know.  I hope you agree.</p><p>Yes of course, that is exactly what I&apos;m doing - exploring what we<br/>know.</p><p>&gt;&gt; Ibo: But I can&apos;t find any place in Walther&apos;s lexicon,<br/>&gt;&gt; where he explicitly describes any temperament, neither<br/>&gt;&gt; theoretical, nor that it is to be found here or there.</p><p>&gt; JR: It is traditional in the Thuringian/Harz tradition<br/>&gt; not to quote the work of other people when their works<br/>&gt; are published.</p><p>Strange, but Walther&apos;s Lexikon (he was from Thuringia) does<br/>exactly what you deny: It constantly quotes and makes references -<br/>however, not to temperaments - sometimes it quotes.<br/>I could easily display hundreds of printed matter from Thuringia<br/>in the 17th and 18 century in which quoting as everywhere else in<br/>a circle of 2000 kms around Thuringia, was done extensively.<br/>Especially, when honoring someone else&apos;s work...</p><p>Since you want to write a book about Bach&apos;s tuning, you will do<br/>better in checking some sources from time to time, so that you<br/>avoid all this easily falsifiable statements.</p><p>&gt; Werckmeister&apos;s writings were widely disbursed.</p><p>Yes,  especially his Orgelprobe, which served its function towards<br/>organists how to technically examine an organ. The small<br/>temperament part was - as now often said, not taken into the organ<br/>builder&apos;s practice.</p><p>&gt;&gt; Ibo: And Walther&apos;s quite long entry on Werckmeister doesn&apos;t<br/>&gt;&gt; state anything of what we have discussed here, either<br/>&gt;&gt; (except of a list of Werckmeister&apos;s publications).</p><p>&gt; JR: Which means he had a huge amount of respect for Andreas<br/>&gt; Werckmeister, for all of his writings.  Walther mentions<br/>&gt; far less about most anyone else.</p><p>Statistics please</p><p>&gt; There has been a veil place over Werckmeister and his<br/>&gt; importance to the music that followed.</p><p>Which every single modern music dictionary will disqualify as<br/>false staememt, as well as the scientific research on Werckmeister<br/>himself.</p><p>&gt;  In the English<br/>&gt; and Dutch speaking work, little has made a proper impact.</p><p>No, not true either - The influential Werckmeister publication<br/>(ttransl. by J.W. Lustig) i mentioned already.  Then the pioneers<br/>of HIP like Leonhadt, but also their followers Ton Koopman, Bob<br/>von Asperen, plus the work of many organ builders show that<br/>nowadays Werckmeister is used in performance - may be more than in<br/>his days. However, in organs /restorations or &quot;style&quot; copies) it<br/>is almost certainly overused</p><p>&gt; For reasons of the truth, my advice to you is to remain<br/>&gt; flexible.</p><p>Thanks that is good advice, which I anticipated if I may already<br/>since more than 25 years in music</p><p>However in science  I&apos;ll not give in to<br/>- unsufficient or non existing evidence,<br/>- reasoning on no basis or personal preferences and prejudices,<br/>  derived from irrelevant modern practice, nor<br/>- unscientific methods.</p><p>Thanks for your attention<br/>best regards<br/>Ibo Ortgies</p></div>
