A &quot;note off&quot; message may<br/>cut off both notes when one is meant to be sustained longer, or two<br/>simultaneous &quot;note on&quot; messages may be taken as a &quot;note on&quot; and &quot;note<br/>off,&quot; so that the intended two notes are heard only as a single<br/>momentary staccato sound.</p><p>Any reports on such problems would be much appreciated, with e-mail<br/>likely best unless there are ideas for &quot;fixes&quot; that might be usefully<br/>shared here.</p><p>This &quot;xenharmonic Valentine&quot; celebration also provides an opportunity<br/>to express my appreciation for the assistance that members of our<br/>tuning community have offered both onlist and offlist, thus making<br/>these files possible.</p><p>Manuel Op de Coul has provided the technical means in Scala, which<br/>includes an EXAMPLE command to translate an ASCII text file defining a<br/>MIDI sequence in a current or specified scale into a MIDI file. As the<br/>excellent sample files included with Scala (including an excerpt from<br/>Vicentino) show, this feature can be used to produce MIDI files not<br/>only of short progressions or passages but of complete compositions.</p><p>Please let me also very warmly thank John deLaubenfels, David<br/>Finnamore, Robert Walker, and Jacky Ligon for their expertise and most<br/>friendly support in this and related projects -- an illustrative<br/>rather than exhaustive list, I would emphasize. The generosity of our<br/>community is a most moving thing to behold and experience</p><p>This year marks the 500th anniversary of Ottaviano dei Petrucci&apos;s<br/>landmark publication of the first printed collection of music in 1501,<br/>the _Odhecaton A_. One way to celebrate is to make old and new music<br/>available in as many forms and media as possible, including the forms<br/>made possible by the World Wide Web and related networks.</p><p>Bringing together theory and practice, ideal and realization, is a<br/>most timely theme of this year, the first unambiguously within the new<br/>millennium. It is most appropriate that envisioners of new tuning<br/>systems such as Paul Erlich, Dave Keenan, Dan Stearns, Jacky Ligon,<br/>and Bob Valentine should share their creativity in unveiling their<br/>discoveries, whether through tuning tables or through audio-vlsual<br/>presentations. Again, I apologize for a fragmentary and very<br/>incomplete list.</p><p>To keep these most modest MIDI examples in perspective, I would also<br/>like to thank Alison Monteith for her reminder that intonation is also<br/>a specialty of groups such as the Hilliards -- and for her most<br/>insightful and enjoyable glimpses of the world of live ensemble<br/>performance, and of xenharmonic life in its sometimes quantifiable and<br/>often most unquantifiable aspects.</p><p>Also, I would honor both the theoretical and practical mastery of an<br/>artist such as Judith Conrad, an exponent and transmitter of the<br/>mystery of tuning historical keyboards by hand and by ear, and playing<br/>them so as to make the fruits of this endeavor most concrete, thus<br/>belonging to an elect guild of musicians through the centuries and<br/>inspiring the rest of us to learn what we can from this high art.</p><p>There is also the example of the peerless Monz, as educator,<br/>encyclopedist, very pragmatic as well as theoretically brilliant<br/>composer with a certain Aristoxenian touch, and cartographer of<br/>lattices and ratio spaces whose sonorous heraldry is most justly<br/>acclaimed.</p><p>May I hope that if my links are accessible, people may enjoy these<br/>quick examples -- with thanks in advance for any feedback or bug<br/>reports, and also for your patience with my enthusiasm about<br/>technologies which I realize are not quite so new to many people on<br/>this list who have shared so many examples and compositions through<br/>these means.</p><p>Most appreciatively,</p><p>Margo Schulter<br/><a href="mailto:mschulter@value.net">mschulter@value.net</a></p></div><h3><a id=24194 href="#24194">ðŸ”—</a>Paul Erlich &#x3C;paul@stretch-music.com&#x3E;</h3><span>6/1/2001 10:02:14 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Thanks Margo -- as always, it&apos;s so nice to be able to hear _actual<br/>music_ . . . the test was successful for me (though the vibrato<br/>seemed a bit heavy) . . . so on with the music!</p></div><h3><a id=24208 href="#24208">ðŸ”—</a>John A. deLaubenfels &#x3C;jdl@adaptune.com&#x3E;</h3><span>6/1/2001 10:56:26 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>[Paul E wrote:]<br/>&gt;Thanks Margo -- as always, it&apos;s so nice to be able to hear _actual<br/>&gt;music_ . . . the test was successful for me (though the vibrato<br/>&gt;seemed a bit heavy) . . . so on with the music!</p><p>There is no vibrato.
