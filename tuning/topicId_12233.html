I whole-heartedly agree that, by it&apos;s nature, the bulk of messages on this list will always contain more of the nuts-and-bolts of tuning issues, as opposed to directly speaking to music (witness experiments with isolated &apos;chords&apos;). This is normal and I cut slack accordingly.</p><p>OTOH, hopefully, all will remember what brought them to this place on the path. Just one reminder, from Francis May&apos;s &quot;Under The Tuscan Sun&quot;:</p><p>&quot;One spring when I studied cooking with Simone Beck at her house in Provence, she said some things I never forgot. Another student, a caterer and cooking teacher, kept asking Simca for the technique for everything. She had a notebook and furiously wrote down every word Simca said. The other four of us were mainly interested in eating what we&apos;d prepared. When she asked one time too many, Simca said crisply, &apos;There *is* no technique, there is just the way to do it. Now, are we going to measure or are we going to cook?&apos;&quot;</p><p>I say cook.</p><p>Cheers,<br/>Jon<br/>&grave;&apos;&grave;&apos;&grave;&apos;&grave;&apos;&grave;&apos;&grave;&apos;&grave;&apos;&grave;&apos;&grave;&apos;&grave;&apos;&grave;&apos;&grave;&apos;&grave;&apos;&grave;&apos;&grave;&apos;&grave;&apos;&grave;&apos;&grave;&apos;&grave;&apos;&grave;&apos;&grave;&apos;&grave;&apos;&grave;&apos;&grave;&apos;&grave;&apos;&grave;<br/>Real Life: Orchestral Percussionist<br/>Web Life: &quot;Corporeal Meadows&quot; - about Harry Partch<br/>                         <a href="http://www.corporeal.com/">http://www.corporeal.com/</a></p></div>
