Though it might also be instructive to remember<br/>&gt;something along the lines of no less a JI advocate than W. A.<br/>&gt;Mathieu&apos;s &quot;Trojan horse of equal temperament&quot; here:</p><p>&gt;&quot;Play an equal-tempered chromatic scale again, up and down several<br/>&gt;octaves in one hand, not too fast, and let your ear savor its<br/>&gt;regularity, its newfangled, manufactured, precisely measured<br/>&gt;_sameness_. Don&apos;t be bored, be fascinated, mesmerized. This<br/>&gt;sensibility opens the door for the more complex symmetrical forces<br/>&gt;hidden inside the Trojan horse of equal temperament.&quot;</p><p>...something &quot;constructed&quot; and not immediately evidenced in nature.<br/>At least that&apos;s what I was getting from your post.  Nothing wrong<br/>with<br/>that... it&apos;s just that BOTH the Mathieu and the 12-tET system have<br/>that kind of &quot;constructional sophistication.&quot;  Now, whether it REALLY<br/>IS sophistication, as Schoenberg might assert, or going AGAINST<br/>nature... and going against nature, as Helmholtz or Kraig Grady might<br/>assert is NOT REALLY SOPHISTICATED at all.  Some might find it<br/>actually stupid.</p><p>On your OWN work:<br/>&gt; individuality and definition to dense aggregates of separate parts,<br/>&gt; but that they also can substantially enrich the impact of the whole<br/>&gt; (at least that&apos;s my view...).
