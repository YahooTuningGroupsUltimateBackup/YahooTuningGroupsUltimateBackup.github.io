Also means if one looks for &quot;tuning&quot; in<br/>the yahoogropus gropu one will find the group and the archives.<br/>Need to make sure that if it does stop functioning as a group, then<br/>the last few posts to it include the address of the new group,<br/>or the home page for it does. That&apos;s happened to me before that I&apos;ve<br/>done a search for a yahoogroups group and found a group that has stopped<br/>functioning at yahoogroups, but has a few posts at the end about the<br/>new location, so ti is easy to follow the trail.</p><p>It is possible for a commercial thing like Yahoogroups to just stop<br/>doing what it is doing - this happened last year with One List, which<br/>was a large list provider with many lists on it - they just closed up<br/>with a few months notice or so and then those who weren&apos;t prepared to<br/>migrate their lists  to a paying service lost all their posts in the<br/>on-line archives.</p><p>I&apos;d say symptoms don&apos;t look that good at present with all the things they seem<br/>to be doing to try and get some revenue from it - unless they can<br/>figure out some way of earning from it while keeping it free<br/>and not causing too much hassle in the way of advertisements<br/>- one can understand their dilemma ! Naturally it will be because of the<br/>large drop recently, last year, in the amount advertisers are willing<br/>to pay to host an advert on a web site (was it ten-fold,<br/>or hundred-fold??).</p><p>Just one thing to consider - for the long term, perhaps many years ahead.<br/>Universities and colleges don&apos;t close down often, but they do<br/>sometimes change their policies. But then so do commercial sites<br/>and they are perhaps more volatile being dependent on advertising.</p><p>We can migrate whenever needed, and I don&apos;t see it is of any great<br/>significance where we actually post to. Having unlimited files<br/>area will be great!</p><p>Anyway, that&apos;s my vote on this matter!</p><p>Robert</p></div>
