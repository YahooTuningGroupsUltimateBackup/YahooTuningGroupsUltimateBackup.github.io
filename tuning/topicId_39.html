The Vandervoort keyboard<br/>uses a design similar to thatdeveloped by von Janko earlier in this<br/>century; it uses four rows ofkeys in whole-tone series, allowing for<br/>consistent fingerings and easymulti-octave jumps regardless of key<br/>signature. It was designed in 1976and was originally envisioned as a<br/>&quot;shell&quot; to be placed over atraditional keyboard; what&apos;s funny is that<br/>KEYBOARD wrote of it as afailed and forever lost idea in their Feb. 1987<br/>issue (A greatreference, by the way), and just last week, MUSIC TECHNOLOGY<br/>mentionedthe Vandervoort in a working prototype form as being on display at<br/>lastsummer&apos;s NAMM show-- complete with a photograph! Ironic, isn&apos;t<br/>it?Another, less well-known design was the Secor keyboard, which utilized a<br/>honeycomb of 240 multicolored hexagonal keys to allow easy (sic) use of<br/>microtonal scales in performance. Its inventor, George Secor, said ofit<br/>that for less than 31 tones per octave it wasn&apos;t worth learning, andthat<br/>even if it never caught on it would look great as a prop in a SFmovie.<br/>That&apos;s for sure: only two Secor keyboards were ever built, for<br/>alittle-known synth called the Motorola Scalatron, and they were BIZARRE!<br/>Beautiful, but bizarre.</p><p>Carl</p></div><h3><a id=41 href="#41">ðŸ”—</a>Kraig Grady &#x3C;kraiggrady@xxxxxxxxx.xxxx&#x3E;</h3><span>12/30/1998 3:57:07 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>The Motorola keyboard used a Bosanquet Keyboard.
