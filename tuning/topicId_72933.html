It sounds damned good; a very recommendable Goldberg, whatever<br/>&gt;     your position on the squiggle issue.</p><p>Egarr&apos;s program note for that recording is also a feature on the Academy of Ancient Music web site, this summer:<br/><a href="http://www.aam.co.uk/features/0702.htm">http://www.aam.co.uk/features/0702.htm</a></p><p>I used that tuning for a concert here (Virginia) this past Saturday night, Sept 8.  It was on this continuo pipe organ:<br/><a href="http://www.taylorandboody.com/opuses/opus_51.htm">http://www.taylorandboody.com/opuses/opus_51.htm</a><br/>which looks exactly the same as this one:<br/><a href="http://www.taylorandboody.com/opuses/opus_44.htm">http://www.taylorandboody.com/opuses/opus_44.htm</a></p><p>We set it up entirely by ear on Friday morning.  It was very easily done from a single A reference (or from C if one prefers).  On this particular organ the tuning is done by moving stoppers, shades, or sleeves.  We tuned 200 pipes in about 90 minutes; the task would have gone more quickly but we were fighting against custodians trying to vacuum-clean the hall at the same time!  Beats of an organ pipe against both a vacuum cleaner and an air conditioning unit at the same time, pretty frustrating......   We didn&apos;t bother tuning the Sesquialtera as we didn&apos;t need it for this gig.  Just the 8, 4, 2, and 1 1/3.</p><p>Anyway, the program included three very chromatic pieces by Bach: the Chromatic Fantasy and Fugue (played on organ!), the sonata BWV 1030 (usually in B minor with flute/hpsi, but we used violin/organ in the earlier G minor version), and the chorale prelude &quot;O Mensch, bewein&quot; from _Orgelbuechlein_.  There were also pieces by Leclair, Corelli, Schmelzer, and Uccellini.  Basically it was a 90-minute survey of violin sonata rep from the beginning of the 17th century leading up to Bach.</p><p>Brad Lehman</p></div><h3>Brad Lehman &#x3C;bpl@umich.edu&#x3E;</h3><span>9/10/2007 12:12:21 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;Tom Dent&quot; &lt;stringph@...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt; Any clear difference from 12-et? Most of the relevant chords in<br/>&gt; &apos;squiggle&apos; - ie G, D, A, B majors, Eb and Bb majors for the relative<br/>&gt; minor variations, are only a few cents off equal.</p><p>That&apos;s of course true, but..., IMO a focus on listening to &quot;chords&quot;<br/>rather misses the point.  The Goldberg Variations have all kinds of<br/>linear motion that&apos;s at least as important as any triads that happen<br/>to occur.  Some of it is diatonic motion and some is chromatic, and<br/>all this passing stuff creates thousands of sonorities that aren&apos;t<br/>chords.  Sure, the discrepancy from equal temperament is rather low<br/>compared to funkier temperaments, if we&apos;re merely examining triads;<br/>but even so, those various major triads on G, D, A, B, Eb, and Bb<br/>sound (or are at least perceptible through feeling/Affekt) distinct in<br/>quality from one another.  That is to say: when the music modulates to<br/>new keys, the scales and triads seem more tense or less tense, as<br/>musical contexts.  That&apos;s an important point that is lost if one is<br/>merely observing that the thing as a whole is not-very-unequal (i.e.<br/>not obtrusively weird) by counting up the cents.</p><p>And one might listen also for the way the enharmonic equivalencies are<br/>handled, both melodically and harmonically, in the minor variations:<br/>25, 21, and 15.  In #25 all of this is obvious from bar to bar with<br/>the extreme chromaticism.  But even in #15: there are A-flats all<br/>through the second half, but a G# in bar 4, and a bunch of G#s in the<br/>next variation (16).  Or the E-flats in these minor variations, vs the<br/>D#s through the rest of the piece.  The notes obviously aren&apos;t going<br/>to be retuned from variation to variation, but have to serve well in<br/>both functions.  And their different tensions, in doing so, are part<br/>of the musical expressivity.  Some of them are tuned closer to the<br/>flat position (i.e. higher), while others are closer to the sharp.<br/>Equal temperament can never deliver that, because the sharps and flats<br/>are simply at the consistent halfway point within the whole<br/>steps...having no nuances.</p><p>Do this on a real harpsichord.  Play through variation 25 listening<br/>closely to the way the appoggiaturas and suspensions are behaving,<br/>with tensions different from one another.  And as early as bar 1 vs<br/>bar 2, the two upward leaps of minor sixths (melodically) are<br/>differently-sized enough from one another that the modulation has<br/>accomplished something expressive...this early in the variation!  Bar<br/>3&apos;s upward leap from Bb to F# is a third size, sounding different<br/>enough that we don&apos;t mistake it for a minor sixth at all, but rather<br/>it&apos;s an augmented fifth: and sure enough, it resolves upwards next.<br/>By bar 20, where we&apos;ve modulated so far from the home key of G minor<br/>that we&apos;re in E-flat minor, the whole landscape just &quot;feels&quot;<br/>different.  Different and exotic, yet not so much as to be on some<br/>other planet.  It all has to be a careful balance.</p><p>The goal of a good temperament, IMO, is not to call attention to<br/>itself but rather to heighten attention to the music.</p><p>Brad Lehman</p></div><h3>Mark Rankin &#x3C;markrankin95511@yahoo.com&#x3E;</h3><span>9/10/2007 2:38:02 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Gene et al,</p><p>I have somehow missed the squiggle issue.
