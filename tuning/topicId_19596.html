Just when I though that the FAQ might be useful to me it seems<br/>that it is to be in hypertext, which makes it hard to take home and<br/>read.  OK so I am in a minority, but I am not usually attached to the<br/>network when I read e-mail, and very rarely do I use the web for<br/>anything, being visual, gaudy, required clicking and all kinds of<br/>other things from which I prefer to protect myself.<br/>==John ff</p></div><h3>Dave Keenan &#x3C;D.KEENAN@UQ.NET.AU&#x3E;</h3><span>3/2/2001 5:57:56 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In tuning@y..., J.P.FFITCH@M... wrote:<br/>&gt; Ho hum.
