You must have<br/>&gt; been actually either talking about the major 7th chord Eb-G-Bb-D, or<br/>&gt; the dominant 7th chord Eb-G-Bb-Db. I assumed the former in my last<br/>&gt; post, but if it was the latter, you were actually following my<br/>&gt; original prescription of what to try. Which was it?</p><p>Hi Paul...</p><p>Sorry, I mis-typed.  Or more accurately, I mis-&quot;thought.&quot;  It is, of<br/>course, the DOMINANT 7th chord I was talking about... Eb-G-Bb-Db, which<br/>was what you wanted me to try, with root, fifth and seventh on the black<br/>keys and the third, &quot;G,&quot; on the white key...</p><p>This was the one where there was virtually NO beating in your 12-22<br/>scale, compared to clearly audible beating in the 12t-ET version.</p><p>So the experiment was really a striking success.</p><p>I also, just now, tried what, I believe, you are considering the<br/>&quot;mirror&quot;... E-G#-B-D, with the root, fifth and seventh on &quot;white&quot; keys<br/>and the third on a black...</p><p>This produces a similar result... with almost NO beating in the 12-22<br/>scale... a clearly audible difference from 12t-ET!</p><p>I&apos;m finding that in a higher octave (starting on Eb5 and E5) the results<br/>are even more strikingly different!  The 12-22 chords are incredibly<br/>more smooth and &quot;sonorous.&quot;</p><p>________ _____ ___ _ _<br/>Joseph Pehrson</p></div>
