But Tcherepnin&apos;s music is loaded with it. Leon<br/>Botstein conducted Tcherepnin&apos;s Rhapsodie Georgienne here last year,<br/>an early work based on Georgian folk tunes, and it was loaded with<br/>Tcherepnin scale, every page. Easy to find, because there&apos;s always one<br/>augmented triad missing from it. If Tcherepnin&apos;s interest was piqued<br/>by Georgian folk music, there may be some folk use of it that Liszt<br/>got hold of, as omniverously as he studied every folk music he could<br/>find out about.&quot;</p><p>--Dan Stearns</p></div><h3><a id=13934 href="#13934">ðŸ”—</a>Paul H.
