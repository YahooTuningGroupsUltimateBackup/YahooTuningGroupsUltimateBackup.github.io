You might be interested in some retuned versions of &quot;Carmina Chromatico&quot;, another piece from the _Prophetiae Sibyllarum_, that Peter Schubert and I made for a conference presentation a couple of years ago. This particular conference was interdisciplinary, with all kinds of researchers who didn&apos;t know much music theory, so you will find it&apos;s at an introductory level--plus this quick write-up leaves out the best stuff (our Vicentino renderings, and analysis of some of the enharmonic madrigals), to save it for a more in-depth article in a theory-friendly venue. No doubt there will be nits to pick, but you might like listening to the retuned versions of the Lassus motet, that each show a different approach to where to hide the commas. The article is here:</p><p><a href="http://www.musicstudies.org/JIMS2008/articles/Wild_JIMS_0821208.pdf">http://www.musicstudies.org/JIMS2008/articles/Wild_JIMS_0821208.pdf</a></p><p>and the music examples are here:</p><p><a href="http://www.musicstudies.org/JIMS2008/multimedia/WildMP3/">http://www.musicstudies.org/JIMS2008/multimedia/WildMP3/</a></p><p>The idea is not that we claim any of the tunings as a historically accurate rendition (as an aside, my vote for best intonational practice for a piece like this would be a more-or-less meantone approach to the root progressions in the bass, with upper parts aiming for pure sonorities on sustained major chords, and adjusting their melodic intervals accordingly). The article is more of an introduction to the kinds of things you have to think about with JI (and I see some posters to the list know all about this), as well as an introduction to the potential of Melodyne as retuning aid to illuminate these kinds of discussions. Our newer recordings/retunings are more sophisticated (less robotic) and when they&apos;re ready for public consumption I&apos;ll post a link.</p><p>My personal response to hearing these retunings was that I have better tolerance for dodgy comma shifts, when everything is presented in a fairly naturalistic context with pretty voices etc., than I previously imagined. Learning to distinguish between the beginnings of Audio Examples 5, 6 and 7 is a good exercise!</p><p>Best regards  --Jon Wild</p></div><h3>Chris Vaisvil &#x3C;chrisvaisvil@...&#x3E;</h3><span>2/18/2009 8:00:33 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Jon,</p><p>Thank you so much!</p><p>Excellent article and examples.

Overtrimming can be a problem.<br/>Kurt Bigler likes lots of context, and frequently complains<br/>that I overtrim.  But I think keeping messages to a reasonable<br/>length should be more important.</p><p>But really, all this manual formatting is time-consuming,<br/>contentious, and quickly leads to tragedies of the commons<br/>like Jon is complaining about.  It would be better if the<br/>software handled it for us.  One has to abandon e-mail<br/>compatibility then.  I generally think reddit is the best<br/>board software I&apos;ve used in this respect.
