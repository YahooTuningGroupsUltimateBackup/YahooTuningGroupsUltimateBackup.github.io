But this is quite a<br/>bit<br/>&gt; &gt; beyond what I could hear in a practical musical situation.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Andreas Werckmeister resolved in his<br/>&gt; &quot;Muiscalische Temperatur&quot; inbetween the first 20 partial<br/>&gt; overtones that on organ tube produces serial<br/>&gt; one after an other, when air pressure is raised slowly.</p><p>I&apos;m not sure what this refers to or how it&apos;s related to what I wrote<br/>or the issue at hand.</p><p>&gt; The same distinction can be found in J.S.Bachs score<br/>&gt; for clarino parts espicially composed for his famous trumpeter<br/>&gt; Gottfried Reiche in Leipzig.</p><p>Likewise.</p><p>&gt; Bach learned discriminating that at first form his own father<br/>&gt; Ambrosius, later from his brother who were both professional<br/>&gt; &lt;Stadtpfeifers&gt;=&lt;offical trumpeter/hornist of town&gt;<br/>&gt; Remember:<br/>&gt; At baroque time trumpets and horns had generally none valves as<br/>today.<br/>&gt; So the ratios: 16:17:18:19:20 were quite common used in order<br/>&gt; to express sharp and flat accidentials.</p><p>If these numbers represent the resonance modes that the horns are<br/>being overblown to, they don&apos;t necessarily coincide with the true<br/>harmonic partials of their spectra. And anyway what we are talking<br/>about is matching such partials by ear when two notes are played<br/>simultaneously, not whether the resulting intervals happen to also<br/>occur between different notes played at different times in the score.</p><p>&gt; Only few generations later:<br/>&gt; Michael Hadyn, a brother of Josef extended that range<br/>&gt; upwards to the 26. partial for early classical musics,<br/>&gt; but only few trumpeters were able to master such high pitches.<br/>&gt; Bachs and Hadyns scores demand rapid melodic jumpes form 1 to 12<br/>&gt; partials up and down very frequently:<br/>&gt; All that had to be executed only by change of lip tension.<br/>&gt; Later:<br/>&gt; the Orgel theoretican JG T&ouml;pfer (1791 Â– 1870)<br/>&gt; distincts clearly the first 32 partials from each other<br/>&gt; only by his ears.<br/>&gt; I.m.o:<br/>&gt; The limit of discriminating just ratios depends on:<br/>&gt; 1. individual ablility<br/>&gt; 2. and it&apos;s training.</p><p>Again, all of this, including resolving upper partials (throat<br/>singers do it all the time) seems completely unrelated to the<br/>question of whether one can distinguish a set of just ratios from<br/>other intervals. The space between the 31st and 32nd partials is 55<br/>cents -- a huge interval by microtonal standards. Meanwhile, hearing<br/>justness in ratios of 31 in general means that both 32/31 and 31/30<br/>sound &quot;special&quot;, and that for intervals larger than 32/31 and smaller<br/>than 31/30, one would have to hear a region of &quot;non-justness&quot; or at<br/>least some distinct-sounding, higher-number ratios. Since 32/31 and<br/>31/30 are only 1.8 cents apart, we&apos;re talking about an ability to<br/>discriminate intervals that differ by less than a cent. Not<br/>impossible, but a far cry from merely hearing the 31st and 32nd<br/>partials clearly!</p></div>
