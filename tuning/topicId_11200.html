Since this is one of the more sensitive topics on the list,<br/>&gt; I&apos;ve kept to myself until now.

This is not to say that any perceived<br/>shortcomings should not be brought to light!  I do believe, however,<br/>that it is possible to fall into a trap, out of a sincere desire to<br/>propagate the authentic essence of a composer, to contribute to the<br/>death of his/her works by pinching off all innovation.</p><p>So, Alex, I applaud your effort.</p><p>JdL</p></div>
