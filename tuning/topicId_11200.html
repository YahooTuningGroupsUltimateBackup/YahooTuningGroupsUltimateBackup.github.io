Since this is one of the more sensitive topics on the list,<br/>&gt; I&apos;ve kept to myself until now.  I am in no way an _expert_ on Partch,<br/>&gt; but have studied his scores, read Enclosures as well as Genesis.</p><p>I&apos;ve not, of course, heard your performance of Partch&apos;s &quot;Barstow&quot;, but<br/>it seems very clear that the project was a labor of love.</p><p>As a general rule, I believe such efforts should be encouraged, even<br/>when/if someone who IS an &quot;expert&quot; believes a specific attempt to be<br/>lacking in some important way.  This is not to say that any perceived<br/>shortcomings should not be brought to light!  I do believe, however,<br/>that it is possible to fall into a trap, out of a sincere desire to<br/>propagate the authentic essence of a composer, to contribute to the<br/>death of his/her works by pinching off all innovation.</p><p>So, Alex, I applaud your effort.</p><p>JdL</p></div>
