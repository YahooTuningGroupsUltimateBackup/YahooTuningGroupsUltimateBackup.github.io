Since this was the first time I did a medley of a tuning survey set I thought it would be a good idea to ask if the medley format is preferred.</p><p>So for those who care can I get a up/down vote on the medley format?</p><p>If the medley is preferred what I may do is put in an audio introduction ahead of each piece.</p><p>Chris</p></div>
