I can&apos;t answer it. Anyone care to<br/>have a go?</p><p>--------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p>This will sound silly but this question has been bothering me for<br/>quite<br/>some time. I&apos;ve studied music theory extensively over the years and<br/>have<br/>pretty much accepted most theories as fact without question. However<br/>one<br/>question I have which has always puzzled me is why a scale? After one<br/>determines a &quot;bunch&quot; of intervals that sound pleasing in relation to<br/>the<br/>tonic the theorists of all time then arranges the frequencies in<br/>ascending order from the lowest frequency to the highest. Ex: C, D, E,<br/>F, G, A, B, C    Why?</p><p>Is the reason because they want to &quot;fit&quot; all the pleasing intervals<br/>&quot;between the tonic and octave to &quot;lock in&quot; the that particular sound?</p><p>If so, I and any one else can also arrange the frequencies so they fit<br/>between the tonic and octave but they are NOT in ascending order from<br/>the lowest to the highest frequency. They are scattered here and there<br/>in no particular order between the tonic and octave. Ex: C, F, D, A, G<br/>,<br/>B, E, C  Why not this way?</p><p>Is it because when a scale starts on the tonic the brain will remember<br/>that frequency as &quot;Home Base&quot; and subconsciously relate all remaining<br/>frequencies to it? If so, then I can still construct a scale beginning<br/>with the tonic BUT the remaining frequencies can still be scattered in<br/>no particular order. Again like : C, F, D, A, G , B, E, C  - As long<br/>as<br/>the tonic and the octave are both on opposite ends????</p><p>We can also get into the topic of whole step, half step, etc (which I<br/>know determines major/minor sound) but how does that relate to why<br/>scales are organized into ascending and descending order?</p><p>This confuses me. I guess my real question is, &quot;What is defined as a<br/>&quot;scale&quot;?<br/>--------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p>-- Dave Keenan</p></div><h3><a id=26324 href="#26324">ðŸ”—</a>Paul Erlich &#x3C;paul@stretch-music.com&#x3E;</h3><span>7/19/2001 2:21:16 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>This person should be made aware that only relatively recently has C<br/>come to be considered the &quot;best&quot; tonic for the diatonic scale -- most<br/>others were previously considered &quot;better&quot; -- only with the<br/>development of the Western common-practice style, characterized by<br/>tritones resolving in contrary motion through half-steps at cadences -<br/>- did &quot;C major&quot; become the &quot;default&quot; mode.</p><p>As for why the scale is in ascending/descending order, I guess that&apos;s<br/>simply the definition of &quot;scale&quot;! It&apos;s not a melody, it&apos;s simply the<br/>set of stepping stones, arranged in order of pitch, on which a melody<br/>may be built!</p></div><h3><a id=26343 href="#26343">ðŸ”—</a>Gary Morrison &#x3C;mr88cet@austin.rr.com&#x3E;</h3><span>7/20/2001 6:10:28 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Here is my belief along these lines.</p><p>First of all, I percieve this to have been, basically, two questions:</p><p>   * Why use a tuning, meaning a preferential set of pitches, rather than just using whatever<br/>     arbitrary pitches you want at a time?<br/>   * Why have a scale, meaning an ordered sequence of the pitches in your tuning?</p><p>I believe that there are three reasons to choose a tuning:  First of all, from a historical<br/>perspective, only a small percentage of instruments could, except through &quot;extended techiques&quot;<br/>produce any arbitrary pitch.  Johnny Reinhard has proven that extended techniques can indeed<br/>produce pretty nearly any pitch (at least on some instruments), but what Johnny does is innovative<br/>much more than historical.</p><p>Secondly, limiting yourself to a framework of accepted and excluded pitches makes the problem a<br/>lot more tractable.</p><p>The third, and I believe definitely the most important, answer to the question, &quot;why build music<br/>around a tuning?&quot; is much the same answer as to the question, &quot;why play games with rules?&quot;<br/>Because it makes the results more interesting.  If a game player can do any ol&apos; arbitrary thing<br/>s/he wants, the result is also arbitrary and thereby seemingly pointless.  Only within a framework<br/>of limitations can you give the impression of clever musical ideas and development of those<br/>ideas.  Without a framework of limitations, you can&apos;t have a clever solution to a problem because<br/>there are no problems to be solved.</p><p>So then what about the second question, &quot;why have a scale?&quot;  Well, there&apos;s also a number of ways<br/>to look at that.  First of all, such a scale could highlight the notes of a subset mode, in which<br/>case, you&apos;re extending the limitation idea.  Second, a scale is a very basic melody, and can be<br/>manipulated to build more-interesting melodies.  Third, from a historical perspective, partly<br/>because of the second reason, it has become a valuable element of musical learning.  Do we have to<br/>learn that way?  Well no, but learning that way does &quot;work,&quot; historically.</p></div><h3><a id=26345 href="#26345">ðŸ”—</a>monz &#x3C;joemonz@yahoo.com&#x3E;</h3><span>7/20/2001 8:02:21 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>&gt; From: Gary Morrison &lt;<a href="mailto:mr88cet@austin.rr.com">mr88cet@austin.rr.com</a>&gt;<br/>&gt; To: &lt;<a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>&gt;<br/>&gt; Sent: Friday, July 20, 2001 6:10 AM<br/>&gt; Subject: Re: [tuning] What is a scale?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; The third, and I believe definitely the most important,<br/>&gt; answer to the question, &quot;why build music around a tuning?&quot;<br/>&gt; is much the same answer as to the question, &quot;why play<br/>&gt; games with rules?&quot;  Because it makes the results more<br/>&gt; interesting.

This is the clearest explanation<br/>I&apos;ve ever seen relating to Schoenberg&apos;s frequent invocation<br/>of the phrase &quot;compositional problems&quot;.</p><p>Of course, that term refers to many other aspects of composition<br/>besides tuning, but tuning was *definitely* a big part of what<br/>Schoenberg was considering!</p><p>-monz<br/><a href="http://www.monz.org">http://www.monz.org</a><br/>&quot;All roads lead to n^0&quot;</p><p>_________________________________________________________<br/>Do You Yahoo!?<br/>Get your free <a href="https://twitter.com/yahoo">@yahoo</a>.com address at <a href="http://mail.yahoo.com">http://mail.yahoo.com</a></p></div><h3><a id=26347 href="#26347">ðŸ”—</a>Dave Keenan &#x3C;D.KEENAN@UQ.NET.AU&#x3E;</h3><span>7/20/2001 8:36:36 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In tuning@y..., &quot;Paul Erlich&quot; &lt;paul@s...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt; This person should be made aware that only relatively recently has C<br/>&gt; come to be considered the &quot;best&quot; tonic for the diatonic scale ...</p><p>Thanks for those points Paul.
