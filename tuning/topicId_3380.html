Apologies for the inordinate length<br/> of this response.  This is partly the result of quoting Margo&apos;s<br/> already long post in its entirety, but that was so tightly<br/> organized that I couldn&apos;t bring myself to omit any of it, and<br/> hopefully I will be forgiven for my excess.</p><p> [Margo Schulter, TD 206.14]<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; First, I&apos;d much like to thank Joe Monzo for calling to my<br/>&gt; attention that Salinas published his 1/3-comma meantone tuning<br/>&gt; (and also a very interesting just intonation scheme) in 1577,<br/>&gt; not 1571 as I surmised in a response to Bill Alves.</p><p> OK, I&apos;ll accept your thanks and respond with &apos;you&apos;re welcome&apos;.</p><p> But in truth, since I get the postings in Digest form, I wasn&apos;t<br/> actually calling it to *your* attention specifically.  I was<br/> responding directly to Bill myself, and had sent my post long<br/> before I ever read yours.   As you yourself pointed out here<br/> once, sometimes the nature of email leads to unintended<br/> miscommunication.  Certainly not a big deal in any case.   :)</p><p> [Schulter]<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Secondly, as to the role of instrumental music in late medieval<br/>&gt; and Renaissance Europe, I would certainly agree that vocal music<br/>&gt; is both the prevalent form and the &quot;perfect&quot; ideal of these eras.<br/>&gt; However, this does not mean that instrumental music was<br/>&gt; inconsequential, or that its influence on vocal intonations was<br/>&gt; necessarily negligible.</p><p> In connection with this comment, I&apos;d like to quote Richard H.<br/> Hoppin, 1978, _Medieval Music_, from the chapter _Polyphony in<br/> the 13th Century_, p 347-349, concerning the time-period about a<br/> century prior to that of which you speak further on. Hoppin is<br/> here discussing the very end of the _Ars Antiqua_ [c. 1300]:</p><p> [Hoppin]<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; The dearth of manuscript evidence for instrumental music in<br/>&gt; the Middle Ages is both astonishing and mysterious.  Writers<br/>&gt; and theorists make countless references to instruments and<br/>&gt; their practical uses.  Manuscript illustrations and cathedral<br/>&gt; sculptures depict a wide variety of instruments, often in<br/>&gt; connection with singing or dancing, but sometimes in ways that<br/>&gt; suggest either solo or ensemble performances.  Peasants<br/>&gt; reportedly played instruments for their rustic dances.<br/>&gt; Jongleurs were expected to play as many as ten instruments<br/>&gt; according to the _Conseils aux Jongler_ written by Guiraut de<br/>&gt; Calanson in 1210.  Troubadours and trouveres presumably sang<br/>&gt; their songs to instrumental accompaniment.  In short, there<br/>&gt; is abundant evidence that instruments played a vital role in<br/>&gt; medieval musical life at every social level, yet only a handful<br/>&gt; of purely instrumental pieces has been preserved.  Several<br/>&gt; factors probably account for this situation.  Instrumental<br/>&gt; performance seems to have been largely the province of jongleurs,<br/>&gt; whose music has either been lost or, as is more likely, was never<br/>&gt; written down.  Peasants too probably had a repertory of both song<br/>&gt; and dance tunes that were passed on solely by oral tradition.<br/>&gt; And at all levels of society, apparently, vocal music provided<br/>&gt; the chief source of material for instrumental performance.<br/>&gt; Numerous poems speak of musicians playing chansons or lais or<br/>&gt; ballades on a variety of instruments, and Johannes de Grocheo<br/>&gt; says that &apos;a good artist plays on the viol every _cantus_ and<br/>&gt; _cantilena_ and every musical form in general&apos; [quoted in<br/>&gt; Gustave Reese, 1940, _Music in the Middle Ages_, p. 327].<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Most of the references to instrumental performance, either in<br/>&gt; poems or in theoretical treatises, are concerned with monophonic<br/>&gt; songs and dances.  It is probable, however, that players<br/>&gt; provided troubadour and trouvere songs with simple improvised<br/>&gt; accompaniments.  We have also noted the likelihood that<br/>&gt; instruments took over the performance of motet tenors and thus<br/>&gt; introduced accompanied duets and trios as well as solo songs.<br/>&gt; Instrumental doubling of the vocal lines is a further probability<br/>&gt; from which it is but a short step to the substitution of<br/>&gt; instruments for voices.  It has been suggested that the caudae<br/>&gt; of conducti were designed for instrumental performance and &apos;may<br/>&gt; prove to be a valuable source for 13th-century dance music&apos; [New<br/>&gt; Oxford History of Music, 1954, vol 2, p 337].  Such an assumption<br/>&gt; is a bit farfetched, perhaps, but vocal polyphony undoubtedly did<br/>&gt; provide music for instrumental ensembles.  A few pieces in vocal<br/>&gt; forms even appear to have been intended for instrumental<br/>&gt; performance.<br/>&gt; ...<br/>&gt; [for example:] ...the &apos;instrumental motets&apos; in the Bamberg Codex<br/>&gt; (# 102-108).  ...Like the later secular motets, these pieces would<br/>&gt; seem to have lost all connection with organum, and their textless<br/>&gt; state, together with their use of hocket, makes the assumption of<br/>&gt; instrumental performance unavoidable.</p><p> I&apos;d be very interested in seeing some studies done on the<br/> intonations implied by the design of medieval and Renaissance<br/> woodwind instruments.  As a former woodwind player myself,<br/> and with the current increased interest in using &apos;historical<br/> instruments&apos; in performance and recording, I&apos;m surprised that<br/> this hasn&apos;t been done (or perhaps I just don&apos;t know about it<br/> - those who know, references would be appreciated)</p><p> [Schulter]<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Mark Lindley, for example, argues with due caution that the new<br/>&gt; modified Pythagorean tunings of the early 15th century, possibly<br/>&gt; sometimes implemented on keyboards with more than 12 notes per<br/>&gt; octave, may have influenced the vocal writing of composers such<br/>&gt; as Dufay, intriguing them with the sound of nearly pure schisma<br/>&gt; thirds involving written sharps.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Lindley also shows how, around 1400-1450, keyboard sources such<br/>&gt; as the Italian Faenza Codex and the German Buxheimer Organ Book<br/>&gt; used prominent sonorities with schisma thirds as a very popular<br/>&gt; &quot;special effect,&quot; indeed sometimes a &quot;stock in trade,&quot; as he<br/>&gt; puts it. While the &quot;explosion&quot; in lute and keyboard tablatures<br/>&gt; around 1500 was yet to come, these trends may have played a role<br/>&gt; in the stylistic change around 1420-1450 which marked what<br/>&gt; Tinctoris (1477) regarded as the beginning of truly &quot;modern&quot;<br/>&gt; music. In current historical terms, this is often regarded as<br/>&gt; the Gothic/Renaissance transition.</p><p> What Hoppin says at the end of _Medieval Music_, p 522-524, has<br/> a direct bearing on some of the points you make here, as well as<br/> on the question of tuning in general, and England&apos;s role:</p><p> [Hoppin]<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; If Dunstable [?-1453] was in [the Duke of] Bedford&apos;s service on<br/>&gt; the continent, as we must assume he was, he would have had ample<br/>&gt; opportunities for meeting and influencing musicians at the<br/>&gt; Burgundian court.  A contemporary poet, Martin le Franc, bears<br/>&gt; witness ... in ... _Le Champion des dames)_ [1441-2].  After<br/>&gt; proclaiming the superiority of Dufay and Binchois over their<br/>&gt; French predecessors, le Franc credits their excellence to their<br/>&gt; having followed Dunstable and adopted the &apos;English countenance&apos;,<br/>&gt; by which means they found a new way of using &apos;sprightly concords&apos;<br/>&gt; to create song of marvelous pleasure, joyous and memorable.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; ...we can only admire the poet&apos;s acuity if critical judgment in<br/>&gt; putting his finger on the one aspect of English music -- and of<br/>&gt; Dunstable&apos;s in particular -- that was chiefly responsible for<br/>&gt; its influence on continental composers... a new treatment of<br/>&gt; consonance and dissonance...[which] began when composers rejected<br/>&gt; medieval permissiveness in the combination of harmonic intervals<br/>&gt; in favor of a &apos;panconsonant&apos; style that required each voice to<br/>&gt; be consonant with all the others.  Hand in hand with this<br/>&gt; elimination of dissonance from the essential tones of vertical<br/>&gt; combinations went a much more restricted and controlled use of<br/>&gt; dissonance to ornament the harmonic tones.  The unprepared and<br/>&gt; accented dissonances so characteristic of 14th-century music now<br/>&gt; disappear almost entirely.<br/>&gt; ...<br/>&gt; We must recognize Dunstable as the greatest English composer<br/>&gt; of his day.  We must also recognize that, for perhaps the only<br/>&gt; time, the prestige and influence of English composers changed<br/>&gt; the course of music history thru-out western Europe.  By these<br/>&gt; recognitions we confirm the judgment of Tinctoris, altho we may<br/>&gt; rephrase his statement to make English composers, with Dunstable<br/>&gt; at their head, the fount and origin of the musical Renaissance.<br/>&gt; In their works, and in the works of continental contemporaries<br/>&gt; who added the English countenance to their earlier mixture of<br/>&gt; French _subtilitas_ with Italian _dulcedo_, music moves beyond<br/>&gt; the scope of the present study.  For the music of the Middle<br/>&gt; Ages, the end had come.</p><p> IMO, Hoppin may be making a few rather broad generalizations,<br/> but overall I think these comments by another expert on medieval<br/> music provide pretty good evidence that &apos;sweetening&apos; of &apos;3rds&apos;<br/> and &apos;6ths&apos; (from 3- to 5-limit ratios) had long been an important<br/> part of English musical performance, especially if one considers<br/> both the writings of Odington and Theinred and the observation<br/> I&apos;ve been making about the lag of theoretical description behind<br/> musical practice.</p><p> In connection with this, it&apos;s interesting to consider the<br/> heterogenous ethnic base of medieval England, a mixture of the<br/> original inhabitants, and successive waves of Celtic, Roman,<br/> German (Anglo-Saxon, then Danish, then Norwegian), and finally<br/> Norman (= Celtic + Roman + German [Frank] + Norwegian) invaders.<br/> I wonder if this had anything to do with intonational preferences<br/> or their evolution?</p><p> The fact that the shift from 3- to 5-limit was noticed by Theinred<br/> so soon (little more than a century) after the Norman invasion of<br/> 1066 seems to me to indicate either that the people already living<br/> in England before that may have been using 5-limit harmonies, or,<br/> still more likely, that it was a characteristic shared by the<br/> inhabitants of both England and Normandy.</p><p> This might lead one to believe that perhaps it springs<br/> ultimately from unrecorded sources in Scandinavia.  The presence<br/> of the Vikings would be the main ethnic differentiation between<br/> England/Normandy and the rest of literate Europe around 1100.</p><p> And the Vikings had sailed to America just before this, so perhaps<br/> they got 5-limit from Native Americans?  I&apos;m speculating wildly<br/> here, but 5-limit singing does seem to have suddenly appeared<br/> shortly after this in the Anglo-Norman lands, and there is the<br/> possibility...</p><p> Can anyone give some insight into the earliest manuscripts of<br/> Scandinavian compositions or theoretical treatises?</p><p> [Schulter]<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; While the formal vocal forms of sacred and secular polyphony<br/>&gt; continued to hold center stage in the 16th century, instrumental<br/>&gt; forms played a very important role also, and madrigals, for<br/>&gt; example, might be sometimes be performed by mixed consorts of<br/>&gt; voices and instruments. In fact, the complications and conflicts<br/>&gt; resulting from such mixed ensembles (e.g. meantone keyboards and<br/>&gt; 12-tone equal temperament or 12-tet lutes) was one topic of<br/>&gt; discussion in late 16th-century treatises.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; During the first half of the 16th century, an incredible<br/>&gt; flowering of instrumental forms occurred, ranging from dances<br/>&gt; and improvisatory lute and keyboard preludes to Willaert&apos;s<br/>&gt; ensemble _ricarcare_. By 1555, Vicentino was prepared to<br/>&gt; advocate the use of his 31-tet _archicembalo_ as a standard<br/>&gt; for intonation by singers.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; In discussing either the 3-limit JI of the Gothic era or the<br/>&gt; 5-limit JI of the Renaissance, it may be helpful to remember<br/>&gt; that these are _ideals_ of intonation, guiding singers of some<br/>&gt; natural variability in their intervals. In performances involving<br/>&gt; mixed voices and instruments, common for example in the various<br/>&gt; Florentine entertainments chronicled by Howard Mayer Brown,<br/>&gt; instrumental and vocal intonations would interact, making the<br/>&gt; former not irrelevant.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; As early as 1516, by which year Castiglione&apos;s _Courtier_ is said<br/>&gt; to have been completed (it was published in 1528), an author<br/>&gt; argues that the most pleasing court music is a vocal solo<br/>&gt; accompanied by the _viola a mano_ -- that is, actually, a lute<br/>&gt; or similar plucked instrument. Various Italian _frottole_ around<br/>&gt; 1500 may have performed in this manner, and arrangements of<br/>&gt; Italian madrigals by Verdelot, for example, for the lute may<br/>&gt; have represented a continuation of this tradition.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; This is not at all to minimize the importance of the view taken<br/>&gt; by various theorists of the later 16th century that there are<br/>&gt; three distinct types of intonation: (1) Just intonation for<br/>&gt; voices, specifically 5-limit; (2) Meantone for keyboards; and<br/>&gt; (3) 12-tet for lutes. However, in forms where these varieties<br/>&gt; of instruments (the voice being considered the most &quot;perfect&quot;)<br/>&gt; interacted, mutual influence or accommodation might come into<br/>&gt; play.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; The influence of instrumental intonations in practice is<br/>&gt; suggested by Vicentino, who describes the conventional practice<br/>&gt; of his time as &quot;mixed and tempered music.&quot; The &quot;mixed&quot; refers<br/>&gt; to his view that even compositions typically classified as<br/>&gt; &quot;diatonic&quot; in fact use elements of the chromatic and enharmonic<br/>&gt; genera; and the &quot;tempered&quot; evidently refers to the kind of<br/>&gt; accommodations made in meantone tunings for keyboard.</p><p> Hmmm... Now your comments about &apos;mutual influence or accommodation&apos;<br/> have got me wondering about the possible role of well-temperaments<br/> during the Renaissance, whereas they are usually associated with<br/> the Baroque period which followed.</p><p> From Anthony Baines, 1961, _Musical Instruments Through the Ages_,<br/> chapter 7, &apos;The Fretted Instruments&apos;:</p><p> [Baines]<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; four centuries ago [c. 1561] the place of the lute in musical<br/>&gt; life in many ways foreshadowed that of the pianoforte in modern<br/>&gt; times [1961], both as the chief instrument of the home and as<br/>&gt; the  first instrument for the professional virtuoso of<br/>&gt; international fame.</p><p> In this same chapter, Michael W. Prynne [in his article<br/> _I. The Lute_]  calls John Dowland &apos;the greatest lutenist of<br/> his day&apos;.</p><p> These statements, on the tremendous popularity of the lute<br/> in general and Dowland in particular during the 1500s and early<br/> 1600s, make me wonder just how widespread Dowland&apos;s lute tuning<br/> [published 1610] may have been.</p><p> This tuning, as opposed to the lute tunings generally cited, was<br/> most emphatically *not* 12-eq, but rather a complex rational<br/> system (I hesitate to call it JI, as it includes no 5-limit ratios)<br/> which functioned as a well-temperament.  See my Dowland webpage:</p><p> <a href="http://www.ixpres.com/interval/monzo/fngrbds/dowland/dowland.htm">http://www.ixpres.com/interval/monzo/fngrbds/dowland/dowland.htm</a></p><p> I&apos;m also very curious as to exactly how and why Dowland chose<br/> the particular ratios he used in this system.<br/> Does anyone have any clues?</p><p> [Schulter]<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Because the topic of the Pythagorean-Aristoxenian-Ptolemaic<br/>&gt; debate is often raised here, I would like to conclude with one<br/>&gt; point about at least the late medieval theorists of polyphony<br/>&gt; and Pythagorean tuning. This really isn&apos;t addressed to any one<br/>&gt; previous article in particular, but maybe to a general trend of<br/>&gt; thought.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; In medieval versions of the Pythagoras story, this theorist heard<br/>&gt; an amazingly harmonious striking of blacksmith&apos;s hammers, and the<br/>&gt; set out to investigate how this could come about. Such curiosity<br/>&gt; led to experimentation, and the discovery of the ratios of the<br/>&gt; principal concords. Thus the sense of hearing and the intellect<br/>&gt; are partners in the kind of theorizing advocated by Pythagoreans<br/>&gt; such as Jacobus of Liege: concord and discord themselves are<br/>&gt; described in terms of smoothly blending or roughly &quot;colliding&quot;<br/>&gt; sounds, as well as in terms of numerical ratios.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Further, to such medieval theorists, concord/discord<br/>&gt; classifications reflect style as well as mathematics. For<br/>&gt; Jacobus, while _stable_ concords are generally limited to the<br/>&gt; classic 3-(odd)-limit intervals, a variety of other intervals<br/>&gt; are also recognized as &quot;medial&quot; or &quot;imperfect&quot; concords. These<br/>&gt; include the major third (81:64), minor third (32:27), major<br/>&gt; second (9:8), minor seventh (16:9), and major sixth (27:16).<br/>&gt; Not all of these ratios are mathematically so tidy, but<br/>&gt; Jacobus hears the intervals as more or less blending, and so<br/>&gt; describes them as &quot;concordant&quot; to various degrees.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Possibly the hallmark of &quot;Pythagoreanism&quot; in such a medieval<br/>&gt; setting is a desire to explain artistic perceptions in a<br/>&gt; precisely quantitized way -- something rather different from<br/>&gt; considering such perceptions irrelevant. Thus in the early 15th<br/>&gt; century, Prosdocimus portrays his fellow Paduan theorist<br/>&gt; Marchettus of about a century earlier as a very bad<br/>&gt; mathematician, but a good practical musician. In fact, without<br/>&gt; necessarily joining with Prosdocimus in his value judgment, one<br/>&gt; can say that the mathematics of Marchettus are at best a bit<br/>&gt; unclear, as compared with the 17-note Pythagorean scheme of the<br/>&gt; later theorist.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Further, as Prosdocimus shows, it is quite possible to champion<br/>&gt; a Pythagorean approach to intonation while showing an awareness<br/>&gt; of the role of perception. Thus, having recognized the<br/>&gt; distinction between intervals such as A3-F#4 (major sixth, 27:16)<br/>&gt; and A3-Gb4 (diminished seventh, 32768:19683), he wonders aloud<br/>&gt; whether this distinction might be &quot;imperceptible&quot; to the ear.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; In my view, our answer might depend on how &quot;perceptible&quot; is<br/>&gt; interpreted. Certainly it is possible for an attuned listener<br/>&gt; to discern this difference of a Pythagorean comma (~23.46 cents),<br/>&gt; but at the same time, one might guess that in the early 15th<br/>&gt; century, as now, many listeners might find either interval an<br/>&gt; acceptable representative of the &quot;major sixth&quot; class. Indeed,<br/>&gt; keyboard works of the period which in popular keyboard tunings<br/>&gt; would use both flavors of sixths lend support to this view.</p><p> Your points here are very well taken, and I don&apos;t find them at<br/> all contradictory to my views.  On the contrary, I&apos;m coming to<br/> believe more and more that a wide variety of tunings have<br/> always been in use in music, from all chronological periods and<br/> in all geographical locations, and that various different<br/> tunings of particular intervals have always been accepted by<br/> listeners as embodying that interval&apos;s _gestalt_.</p><p> I likened this once before, in a posting, to the recognition<br/> by linguists of the concept of a phoneme, where a particular<br/> language&apos;s rules accept or ignore specific phonetic elements<br/> as embodying meaninful linguistic content, and where these<br/> rules of acceptance/ignorance change according to the language<br/> under consideration.</p><p> I think a musical style is analagous to a language in the<br/> same way, where specific phonetic elements would be analagous<br/> to specific tunings of intervals, and phonemes would be<br/> analagous to the general intervallic _gestalt_.  What is<br/> accepted or ignored as carrying meaning would change according<br/> to the musical style under consideration.</p><p> I think this idea provides a fruitful avenue for further<br/> research.</p><p> [Schulter]<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Here I wish not at all to minimize the importance of our ongoing<br/>&gt; dialogue regarding the traditions of Pythagorus, Ptolemy, and<br/>&gt; Aristoxenes, only to caution against any blanket equation of<br/>&gt; &quot;Pythagorean&quot; theory during the medieval period with an<br/>&gt; indifference to the evidence of the senses or to the vital<br/>&gt; dynamics of style.</p><p> I would like to comment here on your last clause, inasmuch as<br/> I&apos;m the one who posted recently on that subject.</p><p> I was referring specifically to Ptolemy&apos;s views of strict<br/> Pythagorean theory being &apos;numbers divorced from acoustical<br/> reality&apos;.  Ptolemy&apos;s attempts to reconcile the Pythagorean<br/> (rational) and Aristoxenean (irrational) approaches was probably<br/> a result of the neo-Pythagorean revival of his day.</p><p> From the evidence of Ptolemy&apos;s treatise, theorists c. 100 AD had<br/> enthusastically re-embraced Pythagorean theory, and, his empirical<br/> results not jiving with this, Ptolemy sought to include the more<br/> musically empirical theories of Aristoxenus.</p><p> I did not mean to imply that this attitude towards Pythagorean<br/> theory is valid for the medieval period, or that it was held<br/> by medieval theorists themselves.  I humbly bow before your<br/> expertise in this area.</p><p> A point that I was making in earlier posts which I would like<br/> to reiterate:</p><p> The mathematical descriptions of tunings by theorists of the<br/> 1300-1500s became proportionately more accurate and more complex<br/> as these theorists became increasingly well acquainted with<br/> ancient Greek treatises which used non-Pythagorean ratios<br/> and, in the case of Aristoxenus, non-rational measurements.<br/> However, this does not *necessarily* reflect the actual state of<br/> musical practice before 1300 as *using* less complex tunings.<br/> As I said, descriptive music-theory *always* lags (sometimes far)<br/> behind practice.</p><p> (And please note that this statement does not pertain to<br/>  *proscriptive* theories like those of Yasser or Partch.)</p><p> If there&apos;s any certain conclusion I can make based on research<br/> I&apos;ve done for my book, it&apos;s that high-prime ratios have been<br/> used in describing musical intervals since virtually the beginning<br/> of our extant documents.</p><p>Joseph L.
