I zipped the file above because I&apos;ve found that Netscape<br/>Navigator 4.0 for Windows won&apos;t transfer .MID files in binary mode<br/>from our Unix file server, but treats them as text files and adds<br/>extra bytes making them unplayable.

Years ago I did an arangement of Bach by Ezra Sims in JI<br/>and I thought it was terrible.  Bach without temperament is not Bach.  It<br/>goes against the composers wishes.

They also exhibit a great variety of &quot;mood&quot;, as Ivor<br/>Darreg would say -- when the pitch drifts flat the piece can get very<br/>spooky and melancholy, but then it will move off in a completely<br/>different direction.  The problem is how to control these shifts so<br/>that the piece retains an overall sense of horizontal logic and<br/>consistency.</p><p>The challenge as I see it in tuning this kind of music has always been<br/>to reconcile melody and harmony, the horizontal and vertical.  Static<br/>JI has the purest harmonies, but even a simple melodic motive like<br/>1/1-9/8-5/4 can be unsatisfying because you start off on a bold<br/>204-cent step and then &quot;back off&quot; suddenly with a hesitant 182-cent step.<br/>1/4-C MT evens this out melodically by splitting the 5/4 in half --<br/>allowing consistent melodies in a consonant 5-limit harmonic context<br/>-- but melodies that have a &quot;laid-back&quot; quality since the emphasis is<br/>still on vertical sonority.</p><p>Since much of Bach does indeed &quot;work&quot; in MT in the sense that it is<br/>possible to pick a key of MT that will get through the entire piece<br/>without ever sounding perfectly awful (tuned in C MT the Chaconne has<br/>only one very brief wolf fifth at beat 69:1:254), 1/5-C MT is a<br/>nice compromise because the overall horizonal structure remains<br/>logically consistent while trading off vertical consonance just a bit<br/>for slightly more melodically aggressive seconds and thirds.  At the<br/>same time, there are noticeable changes in consonance as the piece<br/>modulates, just as in irregular circular temperaments -- including the<br/>occasional 5:6:7 or 4:5:6:7 harmony, such as the diminished chords<br/>from 2:09-2:39 and the Bb7 and Eb7 around 5:01-5:17, a happy side<br/>effect of the tuning that adds moments of spice and variety.</p><p>As I say, some of the pitch shifts in the tighter 5-limit adaptive JI<br/>versions are evocative, but others strike me as weird or disturbing, a<br/>disruption of the horizontal flow of the piece.  Maybe there&apos;s some<br/>relatively simple set of horizontal constraints that could control<br/>that and result in a choir-like naturalness in both dimensions.</p><p>--Ken</p></div><h3><a id=6401 href="#6401">ðŸ”—</a>Paul H.

That&apos;s a wonderful new harmonic twist that sounds very &quot;right&quot; in the<br/>context and is missed out on in well- or equal-tempered renditions of Bach,<br/>and possibly versions which use more than 12 pitches of meantone (can you<br/>tell us whether Bach really spelled these chords as dominant sevenths or<br/>augmented sixths?). Thanks for bringing this to light! But doesn&apos;t 1/4-comma<br/>meantone do an even better job for these harmonies? I find the 1/4-comma<br/>version more distinctive due to the just major thirds, but overall both<br/>meantones work great.
