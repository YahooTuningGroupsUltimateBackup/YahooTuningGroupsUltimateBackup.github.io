If you &gt;don&apos;t find it in other<br/>&gt;GeneralMusic info I&apos;ll go back and look for the links...</p><p>I have got a keyboard mostly like the one you are describing.<br/>It is GeneralMusic&apos;s WX2, and I found it used one and half years ago for around 500 Euro.<br/>It is mostly like the description above, except that it has no hard disk, but it has a floppy disk drive, so you can store settings in the internal SRAM, or on a floppy disk.<br/>It comes with lots and lots of MIDI and special functions, which I didn&apos;t explore, as I mostly use it for playing antique keyboard music with the simple pipe organ and harpsichord effects, with meantone  or Werkmeister III temperaments.<br/>When I purchased it, it had already been superseded by an hard-disk version, and surely the mentioned Genesis is a further advanced instrument; I don&apos;t know it.</p><p>About tuning, it comes with 6 preset temperaments (ET, inverse (not really a temperament; it just inverts the order of the keys), mesotonic, werkmeister III, arabian 1, arabian 2. In addition, it has 4 programmable temperaments, which can be stored, as I said, in SRAM or on a floppy.<br/>As for microtuning, it allows to tune each note of the 12-notes octave by steps of 1/64 of an ET semitone, for a maximum of +/- 1 semitone; each key can be transposed at will.<br/>This is a bit limiting, but using some tricks you can do funny things.<br/>For an example, some time ago I made an experiment about the possible configuration of the keyboard and the stops of the ancient hydraulis, and I made a simulation with this keyboard, setting a chromatic scale over the white keys, with four different &quot;stops&quot;.</p><p>Should someone want more information, please ask.</p><p>Regards<br/>Leonardo</p></div>
