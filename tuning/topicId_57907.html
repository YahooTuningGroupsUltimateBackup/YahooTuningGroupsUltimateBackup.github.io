Music like this is why I have been<br/>obsessed<br/>with microtonal music for the past 4 decades.</p><p>The performance of the Carrillo Preludio a Colon is stunningly<br/>beautiful. As I<br/>have said elsewhere, it&apos;s one of my favorite microtonal pieces, the one<br/>that<br/>first got me fascinated with xenharmonics back in my high school days. I<br/>like this<br/>performance better than the one on the Phillips set</p><p>I was particularly struck by the Scelsi piece as he is one of the<br/>composers<br/>about whom I&apos;ve heard a great deal, but haven&apos;t had much opportunity<br/>to hear their music. Contrawise, I enjoyed the Lou Harrison and Partch<br/>pieces<br/>because I know their other music well, but was not familiar with these<br/>particular examples.</p><p>The Ives Quartet was a revelation in 21-tone extended Pythagorean tuning<br/>that<br/>Johnny deduced from Ives&apos;s  writings and the score. It&apos;s piquant without<br/>the<br/>dissonant confusion that I hear in many passages of Ives&apos;s music.</p><p>--John</p></div>
