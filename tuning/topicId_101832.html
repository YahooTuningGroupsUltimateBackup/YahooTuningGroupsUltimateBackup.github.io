I&apos;ve been working with Gary David and Marcus Hobbs for the last 5 years trying to figure out a way to explain to the general public  the groundbreaking work of Ervin Wilson, a &quot;musical cosmologist&quot; with whom we have all studied.  His contribution to music is very deep and we believe represents a major evolution in the future of music and other fields as well.  I&apos;ve put in at least 5000 hours filming, editing, scoring and narrating etc., what was supposed to be a short documentary but ending up being a &quot;transmedia&quot; project including an ipad app, an album, and some commissioned artwork all parked on an elaborate website dedicated to his work.  The main event at the website is a 21 minute film that gives the viewer a chance to directly experience the effect of his musical innovations.  The site has 11 other explanatory videos, interviews, and more to come as well.  I&apos;d love it if everyone receiving this email would do me a favor and go to the site, leaving your comments under the different films and mp3&apos;s.   You input will largely influence how we proceed with all this so please be honest.  I am in the middle of an intensive Disney project right now and have not been able to get back to friends and family very fast but please let me know if this material  in any way connects with you or not.  We&apos;d appreciate if you sent the website to as many people as you think would be interested, and/or post on your Facebook page.<br/>Thanks for taking the time to check it out.</p><p><a href="http://www.thesonicsky.com">www.thesonicsky.com</a></p><p>Thanks so much,<br/>Stephen James Taylor</p></div>
