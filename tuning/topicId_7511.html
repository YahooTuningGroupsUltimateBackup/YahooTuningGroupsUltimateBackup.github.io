If Harmonielehre is any indication, a work which I read<br/>(unfortunately, since it is uneven) rather carefully, the overtone series<br/>was Schoenberg&apos;s ultimate destination, although he ended with the 12-tone<br/>system as the great &quot;temperment&quot; compromise as, obviously, many others have<br/>as well.</p><p>As he states in the Harmonielehre (well, OK, so it IS in a footnote):</p><p>&quot;Then new systems of temperament with smaller intervals might come about,<br/>later perhaps even complete independence and freedom in the use of all<br/>conceivable intervals, all conceivable frequencies and combinations.  Now<br/>the division of the octave into 53 equal parts would be an example of a new<br/>temperament...  It is clear that, just as the overtones led to the 12-part<br/>division of the simplest consonance, the octave, so they will eventually<br/>bring about the further differentiation of this interval.&quot;</p><p>Joseph Pehrson</p></div>
