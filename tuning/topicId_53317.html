So you are saying you start with the sequence<br/>from the diagonal and then you sit down and work out some details<br/>analytically but intuitively and through that process derive a scale?  If<br/>so, this is great because it exposes some of the implicit knowledge that<br/>makes the discourse here harder for the newbie to assimilate.</p><p>&gt; Also on the diagonal is listed the recurrent<br/>&gt; sequence that generates the series found by the sum of the diagonals.

Pick any one of your meruone<br/>examples.  If you can explain it from basic principles without needing to<br/>refer to MOS as an existing body of knowledge then all the better.  But if<br/>that isn&apos;t realistic then maybe I need to assimilate MOS first.
