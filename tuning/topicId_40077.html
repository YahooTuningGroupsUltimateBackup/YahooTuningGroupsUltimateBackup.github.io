In some cases one has to decide between two possibilities which is the<br/>best at a certain point.</p><p>That&apos;s why I say one can&apos;t sight-read and play music in just intonation not<br/>scored for that. As at some point more than one possibility presents itself.<br/>And one has to choose the best one. Sometimes both posibilities are JI ones.<br/>Thus I worked out my scale so as to have the minimum JI scoring needed--only<br/>on the split digitals.</p><p>But enven then, oen has to first determine which scale to use on which<br/>manual. So the music still needs to be scored for that. In other words,<br/>playing in JI isn&apos;t any kid stuff!
