The least upper bound of the intervals between<br/>  successive elements of the scale is the maximum scale step, and the greatest<br/>  lower bound is the minimum scale step. The element of the scale obtained by<br/>  counting up n scale steps is the nth degree, by counting down is the &ndash;nth<br/>  degree; 0 is the 0th degree. The set of positive real numbers which are the tones<br/>  so represented is also regarded as the scale.<br/>or scale and degrees have another sense where it could exist more than one<br/>path between the first and the last degrees of the scale. In that second case<br/>the definition of connected scale would not be precise since scale and degree<br/>would not be defined.</p><p>In the first case, using strictly the definitions, on could say<br/>  A scale whose steps belong to a set S is said<br/>    &quot;connected with respect to a set of intervals S&quot;.<br/>In the same way,<br/>  A women made pregnant by her lover S could be said<br/>    &quot;pregnant with respect to her lover S&quot;<br/>       while<br/>    &quot;non-pregnant with respect to her husband H&quot;.<br/>How to believe that a &quot;relative connectedness&quot; could convey an exact sense, when<br/>it seems that that conveys about nothing? I recall what Gene wrote:<br/>  A definition is not supposed to be elegant, it is supposed to be precise. If it<br/>  isn&apos;t, it does not do the job it needs to do, which is to convey an exact sense<br/>  which allows one to understand precisely what is meant, what some is and what<br/>  it isn&apos;t.<br/>Do a connectedness of a scale relative to S, be a property of the scale or a property<br/>of the relation between the scale and S?</p><p>I suppose Gene seeks to adapt, in his simplest way, my concept on contiguity. So,<br/>I would like to say him it does&apos;nt convey any idea of relativity.</p><p>A gammier mode is not relatively connected but absolutely connected since the unique<br/>set A for which it has sense to refer the connectedness is strictly determined by the<br/>gammier structure itself. But it is very easy to generalize since I have a propension<br/>to use independant axioms. I recall first my two following definitions with the<br/>correction (k distinct from unison) in contiguity.<br/>   Atom definition in an harmoid<br/>    a is an atom if<br/>      a &gt; u (where u is the unison) and<br/>      xy = a has no solution where both (u &lt; x &lt; a) and (u &lt; y &lt; a)<br/>  Contiguity axiom is<br/>    any interval k is divisible by an atom   (k distinct from unison)<br/>      or there exist an atom a such that ax = k has a solution<br/>I defined atom in harmoid for it&apos;s there it has really sense, but the definition would<br/>remain valid in any finite subset G of rational numbers with standard multiplication,<br/>neutral element 1, and standard order (or a similar additive structure).</p><p>In a such subset G respecting the contiguity condition, any element k distinct from the<br/>neutral element is divisible by an atom, say a. Thus, there exist b such that ab = ba = k.<br/>While b is not the neutral element, it remains, like k, divisible by an atom, so there exist<br/>minimally one path, where all steps are atoms, between the neutral element and any k<br/>including sup(G) and min(G), when distinct from the neutral element.</p><p>When a such set G is a gammoid, I name these paths modes, reserving the term mode<br/>to denote such (connected) paths when they have the same number of degrees (what<br/>is determined by the congruity condition) in the octave.</p><p>To sum up, the contiguity property (maybe the connectedness you seeked to define) is<br/>an essential property of a mode such I conceptualize that, as gammier mode.</p><p>Why I would want to introduce infinity, like your simplest way, while my way is so short?</p><p>Pierre Lamothe</p></div>
