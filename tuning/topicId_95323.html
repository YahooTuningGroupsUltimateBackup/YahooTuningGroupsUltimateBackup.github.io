The page is here:</p><p><a href="http://xenharmonic.wikispaces.com/Apotome+family">http://xenharmonic.wikispaces.com/Apotome+family</a></p><p>I think it makes more sense for the 5-limit version to be called<br/>&quot;whitewood,&quot; since the 5-limit temperament eliminating the pythagorean<br/>limma is &quot;blackwood,&quot; so I made that change. The 7-limit version I<br/>also kept as &quot;whitewood,&quot; for now.</p><p>I also added an &quot;other whitewood&quot; 7-limit extension which 35-tet<br/>supports; this equates the 5-limit chromatic semitone (25/24) with the<br/>3.7-limit septimal comma (65/64). This means that 525/512 is tempered<br/>out. This doesn&apos;t seem to be as good as the first 7-limit whitewood<br/>temperament.</p><p>I&apos;m also really confused because tempering 2187/2048 and 225/224 seems<br/>to yield 28-tet and 35-tet in Graham&apos;s temperament finder, but both of<br/>these aren&apos;t marvel temperaments if the best approximations for 5 and<br/>7 are used.</p><p>I wrote the two commas as 525/512 and 2187/2048, but maybe there&apos;s a<br/>simpler way to express them. I also wasn&apos;t sure how to come up with<br/>the POTE generator so I left it blank for now.</p><p>Does anyone have any better names for these than &quot;Whitewood&quot; and<br/>&quot;Other Whitewood?&quot; :)</p><p>-Mike</p></div><h3><a id=95329 href="#95329">ðŸ”—</a>genewardsmith &#x3C;genewardsmith@...&#x3E;</h3><span>1/2/2011 6:36:40 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, Mike Battaglia &lt;battaglia01@...&gt; wrote:</p><p>&gt; Does anyone have any better names for these than &quot;Whitewood&quot; and<br/>&gt; &quot;Other Whitewood?&quot; :)</p><p>You get the honor of naming whitewood, but if no one comes up with a better name in a few days, &quot;other whitewood&quot; still has to go.
