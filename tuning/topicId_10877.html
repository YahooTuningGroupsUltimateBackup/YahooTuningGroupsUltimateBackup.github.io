Of the recordings I own, maybe 1/4<br/>is piano music and I have nothing for other keyboards. Much of Hovhaness&apos;<br/>music does sound as though it would be awesome in just intonation, but as a<br/>practical matter it is nearly always played in 12-tet. It was also said that<br/>he tended to write music that was easy to play. I suspect JI is not easy to<br/>play even on instruments with continuously adjustable pitch like the violin.<br/>Only the human voice gravitates easily to JI.</p><p>&gt; -----Original Message-----<br/>&gt; From: Daniel Wolf [<a href="mailto:djwolf@snafu.de">mailto:djwolf@snafu.de</a>]<br/>&gt; Sent: Saturday, June 24, 2000 12:25 PM<br/>&gt; To: <a href="mailto:tuning@egroups.com">tuning@egroups.com</a><br/>&gt; Subject: Re: [tuning] Death of Hovhaness, Wed.
