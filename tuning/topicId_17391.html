And FUNKY too!</p><p>Thanks for listening and for the kind words, Jacky. I&apos;ve been working on the<br/>FUNK for the past two years. Previously I was working in a folk group and<br/>was told by the leader that though my melodic skills in improvisation over<br/>chord changes were good, I needed to worry less about what notes to play and<br/>more about how to play it . . . i.e., rhythmic pocket and syncopation . . .<br/>i.e. FUNK. Well, the real funky cats down at Wally&apos;s (the Boston jazz/fusion<br/>capital, NO COVER) on Tuesday night put me to shame, maybe in a couple of<br/>years I might dare to try sitting in with them . . . but I&apos;m glad I didn&apos;t<br/>skip over this step in my education as a musician.</p><p>&gt;Are you using an &quot;auto-wha&quot; effect or a wha pedal? Sounds really cool!</p><p>It&apos;s a Boss Dynamic Fiter, which can act _either_ as an &quot;auto-wha&quot; _or_,<br/>with the use of the Roland expression pedal, a regular wha. I use it both<br/>ways. Boss hasn&apos;t made them for years; my original one (bought in the late<br/>&apos;80s) was stolen, but I was lucky enough to later get a used one dumped on<br/>me.</p><p>&gt;I like some of the really free freak out playing too - after my own<br/>&gt;heart.</p><p>The use of a ring modulator was inspired by Wayne Krantz.</p><p>&gt;I conjecture, that you might find enjoyment in the music of John<br/>&gt;Scofield, Zappa (Guitar, Shut Up and Play Yer Guitar, Son of Shut up<br/>&gt;and Play yer guitar) and Sonny Sharrock.</p><p>The 50-year old Scofield has of course had a surge in popularity of late,<br/>both in general and in my own listening. His current quartet, with Ben<br/>Perowky on drums, Avi Bortnick on rhythm guitar, and Jesse Murphy on bass,<br/>is one of the funkiest and most forward-looking bands playing today. I<br/>caught them (and recorded them onto minidisk) at a free Boston show in July,<br/>and they blew my mind -- all were playing samplers as well as their<br/>instruments and the result was an astonishing electronica/jazz tour de<br/>force. Scofield was using a Whammy pedal for interesting-sounding bends,<br/>octave transpositions, and a Leslie-like detuning effect. Scofield&apos;s next<br/>project will supposedly be a mellow, traditional (acoustic?) enterprise . .<br/>. yawn . . .</p><p>I have the Zappa three-disc &quot;Guitar&quot; set which is I think the same three<br/>albums you mentioned . . . certainly an influence as well . . . lots of<br/>one-chord or two-chord jams . . . there&apos;s a large gulf between Zappa&apos;s<br/>composing and his improvising . . . not that there&apos;s anything wrong with<br/>that . . .</p><p>Sonny Sharrock . . . would you recommend a CD to start with?</p><p>&gt;P.S. I love Funk. Good old 1970s &quot;James Brown&quot; grits and gravy Funk.<br/>&gt;You play this style well.</p><p>It&apos;s coming to me indirectly via Herbie Hancock . . . I should start<br/>listening to James Brown himself . . .</p><p>Now, back to worrying about notes . . .</p></div><h3><a id=17398 href="#17398">ðŸ”—</a>ligonj@northstate.net</h3><span>1/11/2001 6:56:21 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@egroups.com">tuning@egroups.com</a>, &quot;Paul H.
