The Bering Strait myth is a very popular theory, but it has never been proven, and can never be proven. If you are interested, there&apos;s a great book by Vine Deloria Jr, &quot;Red Earth, White Lies,&quot; which very intelligently (and with great humor), takes a look at the Bering mythology, and wipes it out (along with a lot of other silly &quot;scientific&quot; myths). I kind of like Indian mythology, there&apos;s a lot of great truths in there, but you gotta leave the typical white guy way of thinking behind before you can get the wisdom...best...Hstick<br/><a href="http://myspace.com/microstick">myspace.com/microstick</a>   <a href="http://guitar9.com">guitar9.com</a></p></div><h3>Carl Lumma &#x3C;carl@lumma.org&#x3E;</h3><span>10/20/2007 10:34:38 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Hi Neil,</p><p>Actually, I haven&apos;t followed the latest opinion on this,<br/>but my view has been that there may have been a land bridge,<br/>but it was hardly necessary for human migration to the<br/>New World, which had probably been happenning by boat for<br/>thousands of years by the time the proposed land bridge<br/>migration took place.</p><p>-Carl</p><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, &lt;microstick@...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;    Hey gang, not trying to start a thread, but...Paul Poletti,<br/>&gt; you mentioned, in a somewhat patronizing way, a comparison between<br/>&gt; the Eskimos view of their origins, and the &quot;scientific&quot; version,<br/>&gt; which has Indians coming over the Bering Strait.

I have nothing against any people&apos;s<br/>creation myths, but if I want to know were native American peoples<br/>really did come from, I put my trust in science and not imaginative<br/>story telling. I place no more factual stock in stories about Polar<br/>Bear or Coyote than I do about God making man out of clay and woman<br/>out of his rib - nil. Truth be told, I enjoy native American mythology<br/>far more than that boring, often violent, and humorless<br/>Judeo-Christian stuff. Love the one about coyote eating the fart<br/>berries! And the one about coyote trying to getting his dead wife back<br/>from the wigwam of the moon is a brilliant combination of Orpheo and<br/>Pandora&apos;s Box.
