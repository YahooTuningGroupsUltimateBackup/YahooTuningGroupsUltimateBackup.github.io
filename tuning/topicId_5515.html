Fun (? !:-)</p><p>Well, it doesn&apos;t look too bad, it&apos;s true, but take a look at the music<br/>&quot;encyclopedia&quot; on the same site, by the same author, and you might have<br/>second thoughts about trusting him on *anything*.  The shocking thing is<br/>that his maths enyclopedia has been picked up by a publisher who has plans<br/>for the whole series of encyclopedias, so we may end up seeing this crap<br/>in print.</p><p>Here&apos;s an example: the entry for &quot;Major Scale&quot;:</p><p>-------from <a href="http://www.treasure-troves.com/music---------------">www.treasure-troves.com/music---------------</a><br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Major Scale<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; The Major Scale, also called the Diatonic Scale, consists of Diatonic<br/>&gt; Intervals. The intervals in the major Scale and the frequency ratios<br/>&gt; they correspond to are Second (9:8), Major Third (5:4), Fourth (4:3),<br/>&gt; Fifth (3:2), Major Sixth (5:3), Major Seventh (15:8), and Octave<br/>&gt; (2:1).<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; The diatonic scale is of ancient origin, although the modern version<br/>&gt; of the scale was introduced by Zarlino in 1558. The diatonic scale<br/>&gt; bears some resemblance to the Pythagorean Scale (also known as the<br/>&gt; Lydian Mode), to which it is probably historically related (Culver<br/>&gt; 1956, p. 132). The ordinary diatonic scale seems to have been<br/>&gt; introduced into Greece in the middle of the Sixth Century BC , was<br/>&gt; standardized by Pythagoras , and has remained the basic scale used in<br/>&gt; western music ever since (Jeans 1938, p. 164). The diatonic scale<br/>&gt; consists of three sets of Major Triads. Major Triads are collections<br/>&gt; of three notes with frequencies in the ratio 4:5:6.</p><p>&gt; There are three intervals in this scale 9:8 (1.125), 10:9 (1.111), and<br/>&gt; 16:15 (1.067). The first two are called Whole Steps and the third a<br/>&gt; Half Step (or Semitone), even though two Half Steps (16/15)2 = 1.138<br/>&gt; are larger than one Whole Step.</p><p>Since his maths pages are very popular, and so potentially lots of people<br/>might also read his music &quot;encyclopedia&quot;, I emailed the author and<br/>explained very carefully and politely all the things that were misleading<br/>or wrong, in this entry and several others. I think they hurt his<br/>credibility elsewhere - who wants to trust someone&apos;s definition of a<br/>cyclotomic polynomial if they think major scale and diatonic scale are<br/>synonyms, and Pythagorean scale and Lydian mode are synonyms?  In any case<br/>he made no attempt to fix anything up or even reply, so I say don&apos;t trust<br/>his maths pages either.</p><p>cheers, Jon</p></div><h3><a id=5532 href="#5532">ðŸ”—</a>Drew Skyfyre &#x3C;drew_skyfyre@xxxxx.xxxx&#x3E;</h3><span>10/16/1999 2:41:47 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>&gt; Since his maths pages are very popular, and so potentially lots of people<br/>&gt; might also read his music &quot;encyclopedia&quot;, I emailed the author and<br/>&gt; explained very carefully and politely all the things that were misleading<br/>&gt; or wrong, in this entry and several others.
