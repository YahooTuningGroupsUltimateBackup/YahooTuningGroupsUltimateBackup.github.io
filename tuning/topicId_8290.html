Exactly a month ago we exchanged on this subject.  See your<br/>post, TD 475.19, my reply, TD 476.6, your response TD 477.22, and my<br/>reply TD 479.22.</p><p>It sounds from what you&apos;re saying that you&apos;re getting no bends<br/>whatever.  Please note, however, that the &quot;sss&quot; and even &quot;ss&quot; versions<br/>don&apos;t deviate all that much from 12-tET.  If you listen to any &quot;z7&quot;<br/>or &quot;r7&quot; file, there should be no doubt that you&apos;re hearing another<br/>tuning!!</p><p>(more s&apos;s stands for &quot;softer&quot;, not &quot;springier&quot;)</p><p>JdL</p></div>
