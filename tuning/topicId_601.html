If download it, you will lose<br/> everything on your hard drive.  It<br/> will crash, and someone from the Internet will<br/> get your name and password!</p><p> DO NOT DOWNLOAD THIS UNDER ANY<br/> CIRCUMSTANCES!!!  IT JUST WENT INTO<br/> CIRCULATION  YESTERDAY!!<br/> This is a new, very malicious virus and not many people know<br/>about  it yet.  This information was announced yesterday<br/>morning<br/> from<br/> MICROSOFT.   Please share this information with<br/> everyone that might access the Internet.<br/> Once again, pass this along to<br/> EVERYONE in your address book so<br/> that this may be stopped.  Also, do not open or<br/> even look at any mail that says<br/> RETURNED or UNABLE TO DELIVER.  This virus will<br/> attach itself to your computer components<br/> and render them useless. Immediately<br/> delete mail items that say<br/> this.  AOL (America Online) has said that this<br/> is a very dangerous virus and that<br/> there is no known remedy for it at this</p><p> -------------------------------------------------------------</p></div><h3>Paul Hahn &#x3C;Paul-Hahn@xxxxxxx.xxxxx.xxxx&#x3E;</h3><span>2/3/1999 7:04:58 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>1.

Anything that says &quot;please forward this to everyone you know&quot; is<br/>&gt; automatically suspect.</p><p>   Taking advantage of these sorts of virus scares would be a curious way<br/>for rival shareware vendors (if such a thing exists) to hurt each others&apos;<br/>sales.  Hmmm...</p><p>   On rare occasion, these sorts of reports are honest mistakes.  There was<br/>a scare a while back suggesting that the tray tables on some particular<br/>Airbus (airliner) were tacked down with magnets, and that those magnets<br/>could, if you set your laptop on the tray table, damage your hard disk.<br/>Apparently some folks at Hewlett Packard did a careful study of this claim<br/>and found it to be false.  It would not surprise me if how such a thing<br/>arose would be when somebody was on an Airbus, suffered a hard disk failure<br/>for a completely unrelated reason, and blamed it on the tray table.</p><p>   But anyway, back to the tuning channel...</p></div>
