What follows may indeed by a &quot;Platonic&quot; (or<br/>Boethian?) perspective, and yes, at least one person on this List is quite<br/>ready to say that the Hammond organ is an ingenious example of a JI tuning<br/>emulating a tempered system. Likewise, Monz&apos;s 64:75:96 is to me JI simply<br/>because it involves all integer ratios; one of my early reactions was that<br/>64:75 is rather close to the regular 22-tET minor third of 5/22 octave, or<br/>vice versa. There are many more new points, and what follows is merely a<br/>response to one stage of the dialogue which I hope may still be relevant.]</p><p>Hello, there, everyone, and I would like to respond to four<br/>contributors who have posted recently on the topic of just intonation<br/>(JI), thanking them all very warmly both for their invaluable insights<br/>and for their stimulating provocations to further discussion.</p><p>--------------------------------------------------------------<br/>1. To Dave Keenan: JI as tuning by multitudes (integer ratios)<br/>--------------------------------------------------------------</p><p>Please let me begin, Dave, by expressing my admiration for your<br/>eloquent statement of a vital viewpoint on the nature of just<br/>intonation and of music in general with a very rich tradition behind<br/>it.</p><p>Here, as is so often the case, our differences may reflect our<br/>divergent philosophical approaches and first axioms. We are both<br/>strongly oriented to historical traditions and concepts, but select<br/>different aspects of history on which to focus. In explaining my own<br/>viewpoint, I hope that I may help to bring these differences into<br/>better perspective while promoting mutual understanding.</p><p>From my largely medievalist perspective, I might define JI in the<br/>broadest sense as &quot;tuning by multitudes,&quot; that is, integer ratios, in<br/>contrast to &quot;tuning by magnitudes&quot; including intervals with irrational<br/>ratios. Thus my definition _is_ a mathematical one, in line with the<br/>medieval European quadrivium (arithmetic, geometry, astronomy,<br/>music). We might say that JI involves arithmetic ratios, while<br/>tempered systems involve geometric ones.</p><p>However, especially when placed in historical perspective, this<br/>formally mathematical definition of JI normally has some concrete<br/>musical implications, because typical JI systems feature some _small_<br/>integer ratios as well as other more complex ones.</p><p>In Pythagorean tuning, for example, both medieval and modern theorists<br/>recognize such simple ratios as 2:1, 3:2, 4:3, and 9:8, as well as<br/>other notably complex ones. We have valleys (2:3:4, 3:4:6, 6:8:9,<br/>etc.) as well as plateaux (e.g. 54:64:81) and indeed summits of<br/>complexity (e.g. 512:729:972, Perotin&apos;s g-c#&apos;-f#&apos; or G3-C#4-F#4).</p><p>Similarly, LaMonte Young&apos;s intricate JI systems feature valley ratios<br/>such as 3:2 or 7:6, as well as other very complex ones. We might say<br/>that JI systems characteristically, although not universally, feature<br/>a contrast between simple and complex ratios, both of which are part<br/>of a given intonational whole.</p><p>Possibly many of our differences stem from our each subscribing to a<br/>time-honored concept of JI:</p><p>(1) Just integer ratios as opposed to irrational tempered ratios;<br/>(2) Just or &quot;pure&quot; intervals as opposed to &quot;impure&quot; or complex ones.</p><p>Please let me say that I consider either definition a valid viewpoint,<br/>and that your able advocacy in favor of the second definition reminded<br/>me of Pietro Aaron&apos;s description of meantone temperament in 1523.</p><p>Addressing the musical beginner setting out, possibly for the first<br/>time, to tune a harpsichord or the like, he directs the reader to make<br/>the major third C-E &quot;as just and sonorous as possible,&quot; evidently<br/>describing a pure 5:4 ratio in audible rather than mathematical terms.</p><p>From your perspective, I would gather, this kind of &quot;justness&quot; is not<br/>only a characteristic of JI but its very essence.</p><p>From my perspective, JI embraces integer ratios of all kinds, whether<br/>valley, plateau, or summit: 3:2, 32:27, and 243:128 are all part of<br/>the Pythagorean &quot;family,&quot; and partake of its &quot;justness&quot; in the generic<br/>sense. At the same time, among these ratios, 3:2 additionally is a<br/>Just or pure fifth, a valley interval making Pythagorean tuning not<br/>only formally but _characteristically_ a &quot;JI system.&quot;</p><p>This brings us to the issue of what I would describe as less<br/>characteristic or more marginal JI systems such as that of the Hammond<br/>organ which you discuss, where we have _only_ complex integer ratios,<br/>as opposed to simple ones (3:2, 7:4, 11:8) or &quot;intermediate&quot; ones<br/>(e.g. 13:11, 17:14, 19:16).</p><p>From my own viewpoint, I would say that the Hammond organ illustrates<br/>the use of a formal JI system to emulate a system of tempered tuning,<br/>here 12-tone equal temperament (12-tET). Similarly, Kirnberger&apos;s<br/>&quot;schisma fourth&quot; at 10935:8192 (or a &quot;schisma fifth&quot; at 16384:10935)<br/>represents what Owen Jorgensen has described as tuning 12-tET (or<br/>actually an extremely close approximation) by &quot;just intonation<br/>techniques.&quot;</p><p>Given that we can approximate an irrational ratio such as 700 cents as<br/>closely as desired using just or integer ratios (the &quot;multitudes&quot; of<br/>medieval European theory), and likewise can approximate an integer<br/>ratio as closely as desired using irrational or tempered ratios (as we<br/>do when stating approximate values for just intervals in cents), such<br/>marginal cases seem to me natural as well as inevitable.</p><p>Recognizing marginal cases of JI such as the Hammond organ -- and<br/>these cases have a mathematical and musical beauty of their own --<br/>need not prevent those of us who take a &quot;JI as tuning by ratios&quot;<br/>perspective from acknowledging that valley ratios are characteristic<br/>of most JI systems, and likewise the co-occurrence of valley,<br/>plateaux, and summit ratios.</p><p>As mentioned in a previous article, I might suggest a distinction<br/>between the uppercase Just (&quot;pure&quot;) and lowercase just (&quot;having an<br/>integer ratio&quot;). Alternatively, we might refer to the latter and<br/>broader category of intervals simply as &quot;JI intervals and ratios,&quot;<br/>reserving &quot;just&quot; for valley ratios or possibly also intermediate<br/>ratios. Thus 81:64 is &quot;a JI ratio,&quot; but not a &quot;Just&quot; or &quot;pure&quot; one.</p><p>While my definition of JI is formally mathematical, this approach is<br/>not without its aesthetic motivations. Specifically, I find that<br/>complex JI intervals and sonorities may not too infrequently actually<br/>seem more &quot;concordant&quot; or &quot;harmonious&quot; to my ears than intervals or<br/>sonorities featuring only valley ratios a:b where a*b &lt;= 105, Paul<br/>Erlich&apos;s proposed limit for a &quot;simple&quot; ratio.</p><p>For example, in some timbres, I find the complex JI sonority 64:81:96<br/>in Pythagorean tuning, e.g. f-a-c&apos; or F3-A3-C4, to seem more<br/>&quot;blending&quot; or &quot;concordant&quot; than the simpler and purely tuned 14:18:21,<br/>the latter seeming more like a &quot;special effects&quot; sonority, and a very<br/>striking one. Musically, the first sonority might seem more apt as a<br/>_relatively_ concordant point of pause, the latter as a most memorable<br/>point of cadential tension. To me, both are aspects of &quot;JI,&quot; and a JI<br/>system might well embrace and treasure both sonorities for their<br/>unique qualities.</p><p>With regard to LaMonte Young, you raise an interesting point: certain<br/>complex ratios, in certain special settings, may take on an aural<br/>&quot;primacy&quot; or &quot;quasi-simplicity&quot; normally associated with &quot;valley&quot;<br/>ratios only. Thus under your approach to JI, these complex ratios<br/>might have a &quot;JI&quot; quality if and only if these unusual circumstances<br/>are satisfied (e.g. extremely prolonged durations, special timbres),<br/>while under mine, something like 32:27 is &quot;a JI interval&quot; simply by<br/>virtue of being an integer ratio.</p><p>Whatever our differences stemming from the historical traditions of<br/>&quot;just vs. irrational&quot; and &quot;just vs. impure or complex,&quot; please let me<br/>warmly concur with your distinction between pure and near-pure or<br/>&quot;quasi-pure&quot; intervals.</p><p>For example, we agree that while a Pythagorean interval of 16 fifths<br/>up minus nine octaves rather closely approximates a pure 9:7 (being<br/>~3.80 cents narrow), this interval is &quot;near-pure&quot; or &quot;quasi-pure&quot;<br/>rather than pure. Similarly, I would say that 10/31 octave defines a<br/>&quot;near-pure&quot; 5:4, and 9/31 octave a &quot;near-pure&quot; 11:9, etc.</p><p>From my perspective, 16 fifths up minus nine octaves, or eight 9:8<br/>whole-tones minus an octave (43046721:33554432), is additionally a &quot;JI<br/>interval&quot; in its own right, since it is an integer ratio, but one<br/>distinct from the pure (or Just) 9:7.</p><p>Above all, I see no reason why the term &quot;just&quot; cannot mean either<br/>&quot;integer-based&quot; or &quot;pure,&quot; depending on the viewpoint of the speaker<br/>or the context.</p><p>Either viewpoint has its own historical and intuitive appeal, and also<br/>its complications. If we take an &quot;integer-based&quot; approach, we must<br/>acknowledge JI systems audibly indistinguishable from tempered<br/>tunings, e.g. Kirnberger&apos;s realization of 12-tET or the Hammond<br/>organ. If we take a &quot;purely and perfectly in tune&quot; approach, we must<br/>recognize &quot;JI systems including non-just intervals,&quot; and also &quot;just<br/>tunings&quot; which may sound less concordant than &quot;non-just tunings&quot; of<br/>the same musical categories of intervals (e.g. 14:18:21 and 64:81:96).</p><p>Might I hazard a guess that the &quot;tuning by integers&quot; approach might<br/>reflect a medieval view, and the &quot;purely in tune&quot; approach might<br/>reflect, for example, a Renaissance perspective when 5-limit concords<br/>are pervasive and more complex sonorities restricted to a somewhat<br/>&quot;incidental&quot; or at least cautious treatment (the suspension dissonance<br/>having a particular expressiveness and power when set against this<br/>general norm of homogenous concord)?</p><p>While favoring the &quot;tuning by integer ratios&quot; view, I would emphasize<br/>that your view may reflect an equally important side of music and<br/>history, and that such an exchange of perspectives adds much to the<br/>common dialogue of this forum.</p><p>---------------------------------------------------<br/>To Monz: Music, intellect, and audible distinctions<br/>---------------------------------------------------</p><p>Your recent statement that tuning can involve more than music prompts<br/>me to a somewhat different statement but one possibly kindred in its<br/>intent: that in tuning and in music more generally, not every concept<br/>and detail need involve audible distinctions.</p><p>It is a proper role of music (including its intonational aspects) to<br/>engage the intellect and imagination as well as the sense of hearing.<br/>Sometimes the reach of the intellect may exceed the firm grasp of the<br/>senses, and this stretching or striving may itself be a high form of<br/>musical art and science.</p><p>For example, while the intellect can readily grasp a ratio such as<br/>14:11, some skilled experimenters have concluded that the ear cannot<br/>distinguish this interval as a simple or primary ratio. To use this JI<br/>interval, at once pure to the intellect but somewhat complex to the<br/>ear, may thus be motivated at once by its tangible musical beauty and<br/>its allegorical meaning.</p><p>Also, in a JI system combining pure 3:2 fifths and 14:11 major thirds,<br/>a wonderfully complex ratio of 12544:9801 arises differing from the<br/>ratio of 32:25 by a kalisma of 9801:9800, a proportion to delight the<br/>intellect although too small to be perceived by the ear. The very<br/>imperceptibility of this distinction makes it all the more rare and<br/>engaging, a cherished gem in the array of the sonorous numbers.</p><p>In other areas of music, also, we have these artful subtleties<br/>delighting the speculative or practical musician although without any<br/>obvious perceptible consequences. Consider, for example, the canons or<br/>ingenious and often elusive rules for deriving one part from another,<br/>as used by Josquin and other composers: the audible result is no<br/>different than if all parts were written out plainly, but the puzzle<br/>is part of the total art.</p><p>Here I would add that the intellect should indeed be informed by the<br/>senses, although not circumscribed by their limits. Further, as you<br/>have often most eloquently emphasized, we should beware of taking the<br/>restrictions of a given musical style or tuning system as defining<br/>some universal standard.</p><p>-----------------------------------------------------<br/>3. To Dan Stearns, on intonational poetry and passion<br/>-----------------------------------------------------</p><p>As what I might term a _musico-mathematical poet_ of high repute, you<br/>provide much inspiration as well as concrete substance for lovers of<br/>JI and tempered systems alike. Thanks to you I am now familiar with<br/>the Stern-Brocot Tree, even if my concept of a &quot;periodicity&quot; built<br/>from such a basis is yet uncertain.</p><p>Some of your comments move me especially to affirm the _poetry_ of JI,<br/>the beauty of the complex as well as the simple.</p><p>A standard physics text has a saying which nicely fits my JI<br/>philosophy: &quot;Do not disdain what the equations cast in your path.&quot; One<br/>of the special pleasures of (re-)inventing a JI system is to discover<br/>some new (at least to me) and complex ratio arising quite<br/>serendipitously from simpler ones.</p><p>You and Jacky Ligon have pointed to &quot;two T&apos;s&quot; intimately intertwined<br/>with just tunings: timbre and tempo. While Bill Sethares (and earlier<br/>Ivor Darreg) has brought timbre to the fore, your remarks about tempo<br/>or duration are also very important.</p><p>In fast tempos, I might agree if I read your comments correctly, we<br/>tend to perceive intervals more &quot;categorically&quot; (e.g. &quot;some kind of<br/>major third or minor seventh&quot;) than specifically (&quot;this sounds like an<br/>81:64, this more of a 9:7 or 13:10&quot;).</p><p>Of course, there is also the vital variable of timbre: I am fascinated<br/>by how a pure 12:14:18:21 (e.g. e-g-b-d&apos; or E3-G3-B3-D4) can sound so<br/>beguilingly suave and smooth in one timbre, and yet quite strident in<br/>another.</p><p>Also, within a single JI system as well as between systems, there is<br/>the factor of &quot;contextual normality,&quot; rather analogous to the<br/>principle of Newtonian physics that we perceive acceleration rather<br/>than uniform velocity. Heard as a usual tuning of the minor third, a<br/>32:27 has its own perfection and &quot;naturalness&quot;; when compared to a<br/>pure 7:6, I find that this same interval has a certain &quot;complexity&quot; or<br/>&quot;cloudiness.&quot; Possibly the contrast is a bit like travelling outside<br/>the atmosphere of a familiar planet, and realizing how much<br/>atmospheric haze is a part of the surface environment often taken for<br/>granted, indeed, a shaping feature of the ecosystem.</p><p>Similarly I find that either a more complex 27:32:48 or a simpler<br/>12:14:21 (e.g. d-f-c&apos; or D3-F3-C4) can be a &quot;sweet&quot; and pleasing<br/>tuning of this unstable but compatible sonority. Heard in itself,<br/>either version makes an apt intonational standard; having both<br/>versions available enriches the expressiveness of a JI system.</p><p>What your tuning systems, Phi-based and otherwise, communnicate to me<br/>especially is a love of diversity and its passionate cultivation.<br/>Thank you for your mathematical expertise and musical poetry alike.</p><p>----------------------------------------<br/>To Robert Walker, on JI and transitivity<br/>----------------------------------------</p><p>If I read your remarks on &quot;transitivity&quot; and &quot;intransitivity&quot;<br/>correctly, you have very aptly expressed one of my primary motivations<br/>for defining &quot;just&quot; or &quot;JI&quot; intervals generally as those having<br/>integer ratios, but &quot;Just&quot; intervals as those having _simple_ integer<br/>ratios directly tuneable by ear or at least arguably distinguishable<br/>as &quot;primary acoustical colors,&quot; so to speak.</p><p>By &quot;transitivity,&quot; I take you to mean that a JI interval plus a JI<br/>interval will always produce another JI interval: e.g. 9:8 plus 3:2<br/>gives us 27:16, another integer ratio, and therefore a &quot;just&quot; or JI<br/>interval also.</p><p>By &quot;intransitivity,&quot; I take you to be observing, however, that while<br/>3:2 or 9:8 may be described as a &quot;pure&quot; or &quot;Just&quot; or &quot;valley&quot; interval<br/>falling within the Erlich limit of a*b &lt;= 105, here 3*2=6, 9*8=72,<br/>they combine to generate 27:16, where a*b = 432, going outside this<br/>Erlich limit of simplicity or &quot;Justness.&quot;</p><p>Here it seems musically as well as mathematically elegant to me to say<br/>that 3:2, 9:8, and 27:16 are all &quot;JI intervals,&quot; and more specifically<br/>part of the JI set derived from powers of 3:2, while recognizing the<br/>different degrees of complexity.</p><p>Incidentally, as I remarked earlier in this article, since the<br/>distinction in capitalization between &quot;just&quot; and &quot;Just&quot; may be an<br/>overly fine one, maybe the adjective &quot;JI&quot; would be preferable for the<br/>first or general concept: &quot;27:16 is a JI interval, but not a &grave;just&apos;<br/>one in the sense of simplicity or direct tuneability by ear.&quot;</p><p>As you nicely sum up, this gives JI intervals, like integer fractions,<br/>a property of closure for operations like addition (multiplication of<br/>ratios) or subtraction (division of ratios).</p><p>Most appreciatively,</p><p>Margo Schulter<br/><a href="mailto:mschulter@value.net">mschulter@value.net</a></p></div><h3><a id=16016 href="#16016">ðŸ”—</a>Joseph Pehrson &#x3C;pehrson@pubmedia.com&#x3E;</h3><span>11/29/2000 7:01:22 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@egroups.com">tuning@egroups.com</a>, &quot;M.

I firmly believe that there are many<br/>as-yet unrevealed means of perceiving data that *do*<br/>have an effect on the reception of any given experience,<br/>particularly in some kind of wholistic sense.  In other<br/>words, just because a listener can&apos;t immediately *hear*<br/>that a 12-tone row is being used in inversion or<br/>retrograde doesn&apos;t mean categorically that s/he is<br/>not picking up that information in some other way.</p><p>Again, as I just posted the other day, a listener&apos;s<br/>familiarity with the score or with pre-compositional<br/>procedures can have a big effect on his perception<br/>of the musical experience, even affecting his *belief*<br/>of what he is hearing.</p><p>I might also point out that Schoenberg - the acknowledged<br/>originator of serial technique - believed strongly in<br/>&apos;mysterious&apos; aspects of musical masterpieces which defy<br/>rigorous analysis.

These are not idyllic<br/>&quot;romanticisms&quot;. Music can operate in multilayered ways... at different<br/>levels of recognition.

Consider, for example, the canons or<br/>ingenious and often elusive rules for deriving one part from another,<br/>as used by Josquin and other composers: the audible result is no<br/>different than if all parts were written out plainly, but the puzzle<br/>is part of the total art.</p><p>Here I would add that the intellect should indeed be informed by the<br/>senses, although not circumscribed by their limits.&quot;</p><p>thank you,</p><p>--Dan Stearns</p></div>
