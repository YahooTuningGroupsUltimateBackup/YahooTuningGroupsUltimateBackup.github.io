Your questions prompted me to deduce just how this<br/>puppy&apos;s constructed and here&apos;s how I think it must look:</p><p>So, we have this rectangular glass plate, one side of which is<br/>covered with this mastic goop. Let&apos;s assume that, if standing in<br/>front of this machine, this &quot;score&quot; plate goes lengthwise from left to<br/>right and lies horizontally. Now, below it is a light source, the<br/>mastic surface is on top. When it&apos;s ready to be played it is<br/>positioned so that immediately above it is an opaque plate of metal<br/>or<br/>wood with a narrow crack at the left end that serves as the<br/>light-window. It runs from front to back so it extends the full width<br/>of the &quot;score&quot; plate. Above that crack are the 5 wheels he mentioned,<br/>and these are arranged in a column corresponding to the length of the<br/>light-window. Each wheel,in turn, is made of glass and also coated<br/>with mastic. The 144 sound tracks on the wheel are each a sine wave<br/>drawn in the mastic so light can get through to a photo cell. Thus<br/>you<br/>have 144 undulating tracks like the end grooves on lp records with<br/>the<br/>higher pitches at the outer edge and the lower ones toward the<br/>center.<br/>That&apos;s why he refers to them as &quot;phonograms.&quot; These wheels are always<br/>turning at a constant speed. If I were building it I&apos;d have a<br/>variable<br/>spped motor running them so I could change the &quot;Pitch Standard&quot; or<br/>create mass glissandi without having to do freaky things with the<br/>drawings which, in any case, would produce a graduated, rather than a<br/>continuous gliss. Now, you can draw your sounds on the &quot;score&quot; plate<br/>and a rack-and-pinion moves it from right to left at whatever speed is<br/>right for the tempo of the piece.  I assume that motion as he&apos;s got<br/>all those coders and cutters at the left end so the score would<br/>likely start there. So, you draw the score and then lower the rest of<br/>the mechanism so the plate is not subject to outside light.  I&apos;d<br/>think<br/>some sort of rulers would be essential. This puppy&apos;s botta be of<br/>some size. If we assume a millimeter for each of those 720 sound<br/>tracks, we have this glass plate that must be about 30 inches wide<br/>and lord knows how long in order to accommodate a 5 minute piece!<br/>Think what we could do with a modern version using a cd-type<br/>principle and computer-generated drawings. That way, you could have a<br/>roll of plastic on which you&apos;d have ample width for a drawing and<br/>more length for the piece. But anyway, what a damned clever<br/>invention.</p><p>Jay Williams</p><p>________ ______ _____ ___<br/>Joseph Pehrson</p></div>
