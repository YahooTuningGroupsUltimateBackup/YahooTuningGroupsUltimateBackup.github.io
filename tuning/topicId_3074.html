Sorry about that; I am such a retard sometimes!</p><p>- Jeff</p><p>The corrected paragraph:</p><p>     So to generate the output samples we would start by getting a sample<br/>     at location 1024. After 1/48000 of a second we would advance the<br/>     wave pointer to 1024 + 3.2 = 1027.2. We&apos;d grab samples from locations<br/>     1027 and 1028 and output 0.2 times the value at location 1027 plus<br/>     0.8 times the value at location 1028 (assuming linear interpolation).<br/>     And 1/48000 of a second later we&apos;d do it again, advancing to 1030.4 ...<br/>     until we go past the end of the table at location 1024+256 = 1280,<br/>     where we would subtract 256 to get back towards the beginning of<br/>     the wave table.</p></div>
