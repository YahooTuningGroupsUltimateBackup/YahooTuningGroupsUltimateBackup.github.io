If that&apos;s your source of it...there&apos;s<br/>a typo in Barbour&apos;s calculation for the note Eb.  He gave it a 0<br/>superscript but it should be +1/12, i.e. a slight nudge higher in<br/>pitch.  His cent value for that Eb is correct, though.</p><p>That&apos;s also the temperament that Neidhardt published in 1724<br/>recommended for a village, and upgraded to a small city in 1732,<br/>renamed as third-circle #2.</p><p>The confusion grows; Mark Lindley has given two different readings of<br/>it in various articles of his over the past 20+ years, with the<br/>discrepancy being in the handling of the note G#.  (1/12 comma must<br/>be absorbed somewhere in C#-G#-D#; sometimes he has the C#-G# pure<br/>and the G#-D# tempered, while elsewhere it&apos;s vice versa.)  And both<br/>of these are *not* the same as Barbour&apos;s, due to the Eb problem noted<br/>above.</p><p>Even more confusingly, since I took them by counting serially from<br/>Lindley&apos;s presentation in &quot;J S Bach&apos;s Tuning&quot; (_Musical Times_, 1985)-<br/>-it&apos;s the one I have labelled &quot;Neidhardt #3&quot; in my web materials!<br/>I&apos;m working on a page of errata that will explain this better.</p><p>Whatever these various temps were called in the various publications,<br/>and whatever sizes of establishment they were for: it&apos;s more<br/>important to get the pattern right than to quibble about names of it.</p><p>In practice, of course, the nudge of G# by 1/12 lower or higher<br/>doesn&apos;t make a large amount of audible difference, and likewise on<br/>the Eb.  But just as a matter of academic thoroughness....</p><p>Anyway, I think I agree with your broader point that many of these<br/>&quot;well temperaments&quot; (what an awful term) sound scarcely<br/>distinguishable from one another, in practice.  They all at least<br/>avoid foot faults, put the ball into play, and have a decent ground<br/>stroke.  But there are little telltale areas in them here and there,<br/>melodically or harmonically or both, where it matters.  To my ears<br/>and theory, the most important harmonic distinctions happen in the<br/>way a temperament balances the major triads of A, E, B, F#, Db, and<br/>Ab.  And the most important melodic distinctions come up when playing<br/>music of zero to five flats, and especially in the minor scales.<br/>Good old C major and A and D minor: if the naturals themselves aren&apos;t<br/>regular or nearly so, and if the sharps/flats that occasionally come<br/>into the texture are way too high or low for their melodic contexts,<br/>within the flowing sound as a whole, that&apos;s where I perk up and<br/>notice melodic problems most readily.

(Others&apos; mileage may of course vary.)<br/>My conditioning is set up by the regularity that constitutes the<br/>basis of whatever temperament it is: 1/3, 1/4, 2/9, 1/5, 1/6, 1/12,<br/>whatever.  The *regularity* of the 5ths (at least in most of them)<br/>generates a series of tones and semitones, from whatever size the<br/>basic 5th happens to be.  And then as a listener I expect the melodic<br/>notes to hit on or near those points, spelled correctly<br/>enharmonically.  The more they diverge from some semblance of<br/>regularity, or are played misspelled, the more chaotic the whole<br/>thing sounds.</p><p>I hardly ever play in 12-equal anywhere anymore, unless engaged to<br/>guest somewhere on piano or organ where it happens to be set up that<br/>way, and beyond control.</p><p>If we&apos;re playing in, say, regular 1/4 comma and some interval from 12-<br/>equal shows up, that&apos;s just as much an anomaly (and against<br/>expectations) as vice versa.</p><p>Some of the fun features of regular systems:<br/><a href="http://www-personal.umich.edu/~bpl/larips/meantone.html">http://www-personal.umich.edu/~bpl/larips/meantone.html</a></p><p>Playing again in &quot;Kirnberger 3&quot; for several hours last week, after<br/>some years mostly away from it, I was delighted again by its melodic<br/>smoothness.  Eight 5ths one size (less a schisma in one that&apos;s really<br/>a diminished 6th), and the other four 5ths the other size, grouped<br/>together nicely.</p><p>Brad Lehman</p></div><h3><a id=60135 href="#60135">ðŸ”—</a>George D.

When I tried the 1/6-pythagorean-<br/>comma Valotti WT (identified by Barbour as &quot;Young&apos;s No. 2&quot;), e.g., I<br/>observed that its 4 best triads sounded considerably less consonant<br/>than 1/4-comma meantone, its 4 worst were basically pythagorean, and<br/>the 4 remaining were not significantly different from 12-ET.  Others<br/>may disagree, but I drew the conclusion that if I couldn&apos;t have<br/>meantone-like intonation in the best keys, then unequal tempering<br/>probably wasn&apos;t worth the effort.</p><p>I&apos;ve since evaluated circulating temperaments by assigning a letter<br/>grade to each major triad, as follows:</p><p>A - not significantly less consonant than 1/4-comma MT<br/>B - noticeably more consonant than 12-ET, but significantly less<br/>consonant than 1/4-comma MT<br/>C - not significantly different from 12-ET<br/>D - noticeably more dissonant than 12-ET; comparable to pythagorean<br/>E - noticeably more dissonant than pythagorean, but still usable<br/>F - unacceptable (e.g., a triad with a wolf fifth)</p><p>So in my book a temperament gets graded on how many A&apos;s and B&apos;s it<br/>has, vs. how many D&apos;s and E&apos;s, and where they occur:</p><p>Major triad: Db Ab Eb Bb F. C. G. D. A. E. B. F#<br/>Valotti:.... D. D. C. C+ B. B. B. B. C+ C. D. D.<br/>Lehman-Bach: D+ C. C. B. B. B. C+ C. D. D+ C. C.<br/>Werckm. III: D. D. C. B. A+ B. C. C. C. C. D. D.<br/>Secor #2:... D. D. C- B- A. A. A. B- C- D. D. D.<br/>Secor #1:... E+ D. C. B+ A. A. A. A- B- C. D. E+<br/>Secor #3:... E- E. C- A. A. A. A. A. B. C- E. E-</p><p>If I&apos;m able to come up with a temperament extraordinary enough to<br/>have noticeably better intonation in 6 triads and am able to pay for<br/>it with noticeably worse intonation in only 4, then I would say that<br/>it&apos;s definitely not a waste of *my* time.</p><p>Best,</p><p>--George</p></div>
