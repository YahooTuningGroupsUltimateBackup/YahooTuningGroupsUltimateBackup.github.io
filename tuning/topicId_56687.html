However, I do not think such high frequencies have any valid representation in our context of musical pitch. The &grave;octave equivalance&grave; of spectra is another domain that deserves a seperate terminology all its own. Thus, a light particle that resonates at 380 trillion herz should have nothing to do with a soundwave that vibrates at a rate of 415 cycles per second.

The frequency for middle C is<br/>~261.63 Hz (in 12-ET, with A=440).  Transpose this pitch 41 octaves<br/>up and you get ~5.753*10^14 Hz, which electromagnetic frequency is<br/>near the middle of the visible range.  This converts to a wavelength<br/>of ~521.08 nanometers, which is very definitely green!  Likewise, the<br/>A-flat below and E above middle C will give you wavelengths<br/>corresponding to red and blue, respectively.</p><p>However, these aren&apos;t exact -- a 30-cent drop in pitch (corresponding<br/>to A=432.4) would give you wavelengths much closer to the RGB<br/>profile.  (In fact, C=256 transposed up 41 octaves would give you a<br/>green wavelength of 532.54 nm, which is between the value for the RGB<br/>and XYZ color profiles given here:<br/><a href="http://www.mathpages.com/home/kmath578/kmath578.htm">http://www.mathpages.com/home/kmath578/kmath578.htm</a><br/>so perhaps there&apos;s something to be said for a &quot;scientific&quot; pitch<br/>standard of C=256.</p><p>Anyway, as long as we accept octave equivalence, there&apos;s nothing<br/>arbitrary about this at all.</p><p>--George</p></div><h3><a id=56725 href="#56725">ðŸ”—</a>Ozan Yarman &#x3C;ozanyarman@superonline.com&#x3E;</h3><span>1/19/2005 12:38:14 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>I respectfully disagree with some points here dear George:</p><p>1.

And light also<br/>acts differenly whether it is &quot;additive&quot; or &quot;subtractive.&quot;  Meaning,<br/>whether it is a color due to the addition of individual light waves<br/>(clouds look white because the water particles refract more light<br/>waves of different frequencies, therefore adding to white) or the<br/>subtraction, usually of particles.  I&apos;m not a scientist by any<br/>stretch, but I am fascinated by the concept of why an object appears<br/>a certain color.  Plants are green, for example, not because they<br/>have any innate property of greenness, but because the molecules that<br/>ultimately perform photosynthesis &quot;eat&quot; red and blue light particles<br/>to process to create energy, reflecting those particles that in<br/>combination create a sense of green.  Just the concept of light<br/>eaters - cool, yet kind of creepy.</p><p>There is an excellent book on many aspects of color and culture,<br/>called - appropriately - &quot;Color and Culture&quot; by John Gage (not C), of<br/>Cambridge U.  Inside is a chapter on the Colour of Sound, where he<br/>surveys various attempts to attach the two over time, from the Greeks<br/>forward.

I said something which I have neither enough information on nor the time to pursue.

I am not sure which category it may fall into other than my feeling that it is definately bluer in tint. Perhaps Berlin and Kay should be held accountable for that categorization. Don&apos;t shoot the messenger!</p><p>It just occured to me, that the CRT tubes we stare at are actually producing the illusion of colors on the screen by mixing Red Green and Blue rays in the desired amount.

Even<br/>Malay - a language spoken by hundreds of millions - until recent historical<br/>times had names only for &quot;light&quot;, &quot;dark&quot;, &quot;red&quot; and &quot;green&quot;.  Terms for<br/>&quot;blue&quot; and &quot;yellow&quot; are imports from other cultures, taken on when those<br/>colours became culturally significant.  Contrast this with the hundreds of<br/>colour names that were in use in English even in Victorian times.  It<br/>certainly makes it hard to know which name to choose, when you have, not<br/>only &quot;purple&quot; and &quot;blue&quot;, but also &quot;violet&quot;, &quot;lavender&quot; and &quot;mauve&quot;.<br/>Whatever your personal preference, there&apos;s no objective way of saying that<br/>one colour naming system is instrinsically better for all time and cultures.<br/>You can say that a given system fits the needs of its users ill or well.</p><p>Many of the ardent microtonalists on this list, are, of course, people<br/>seeking new musical languages.  It makes sense to me that they may make new<br/>connections betwen artforms and new distinctions within them ...</p><p>As to how fixed the boundaries are, once we have developed specific<br/>categories:  My wife and I (both artists) very often disagree over whether a<br/>particular hue is a &quot;green&quot; or a &quot;blue&quot;.  To me, it&apos;s probably an<br/>almost-blue cyan with only a hint of green, so I call it &quot;blue&quot;, whereas to<br/>her it&apos;s clearly &quot;green&quot;.

But I can accept that violet is bluer, with purple<br/>&gt; tending toward plum.  From your table below, what you seem to be<br/>&gt; referring to as purple (midway between blue and red) I would call<br/>&gt; magenta (which also is not spectral).</p><p>Yes. I should have used the term magenta for the hue midway between<br/>red and blue. And &quot;red-magenta&quot; instead of &quot;red-purple&quot;. But the line<br/>between red and blue seems to be often called &quot;the purple line&quot;.</p><p>&quot;blue-magenta&quot; could be an alternative name for the hue I called<br/>&quot;violet&quot;. As a colour, not merely a hue, spectral violet differs from<br/>blue-magenta, for most people, mainly by being more saturated<br/>(stronger, less diluted with white). But the fine details of colour<br/>are tricky and vary between people and with context, just like just<br/>intonation. ;-)</p><p>So violet, blue-magenta, magenta and red-magenta can all be considered<br/>varieties of purple.

So the<br/>purple line goes from the extreme red point to meet the &quot;violet hook&quot;<br/>at a tangent.</p><p>The violet hook is the result of that little extra relative hump in<br/>the &quot;red&quot; cone response at the short wave end.</p><p>That Wikipedia chromaticity diagram is pretty good in that regard<br/><a href="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/4/40/Cie_chromaticity_diagram_wavelength.png">http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/4/40/Cie_chromaticity_diagram_wavelength.png</a><br/>but I must agree with you that the 380 nm point ought to be a little<br/>more obviously &quot;around the corner&quot; towards red.</p><p>It would seem a curious coincidence if the cutoff caused by the UV<br/>opacity of our lenses coincided exactly with the tangent point of the<br/>chroma closure line (the purple-line) on the spectrum curve.</p><p>&gt; &gt; What gives hue perception it&apos;s apparent circularity is the posession<br/>&gt; &gt; of exactly three different colour receptors. ...<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Yes, especially taken in combination with [&quot;the red cones become<br/>&gt; slightly more sensitive than the green cones again in the violet<br/>&gt; region of the spectrum&quot;].</p><p>It&apos;s a common misconception that this extra &quot;violet hump&quot; in the red<br/>cone response is necessary for the circularity of hue. But if you<br/>think about it, it should be clear that this is not the case. Imagine<br/>if we had evolved with the same three cone response curves but with<br/>our lenses having a short wavelength cutoff at around 460 nm instead<br/>of 380 nm. The extra red &quot;hump&quot; would then be irrelevant and there<br/>would be no spectral violet. But what do you think you would see when<br/>you mixed various amounts of spectral red and spectral blue light?</p><p>Surely you don&apos;t think that all such combinations would be black (or<br/>white, or shades of grey). Surely a blue with a little red is going to<br/>appear &quot;redish-blue&quot; and red with a little blue is going to appear<br/>&quot;blueish red&quot; or at least it must produce _some_ kind of smooth<br/>continuum of hues from blue to red, that is quite different from the<br/>spectral ones that go around the &quot;other side&quot; via green.</p><p>The red cones&apos; &quot;violet hump&quot; isn&apos;t necessarily an evolutionary<br/>adaptation, it may simply be that the simplest way to evolve a<br/>suitable protein for a red receptor happens to give it this &quot;hump&quot;,<br/>and since it is not detrimental it stays.</p><p>I put &quot;hump&quot; in scare quotes to remind you that in absolute terms<br/>there is no hump, only a region where the response falls off with a<br/>slope less than that of the green cones.</p><p>&gt; I&apos;m especially intruigued by the &quot;opponent processing of<br/>&gt; color&quot; section beginning about halfway through, and ending with the<br/>&gt; revelation that, because the retina reprocesses the trichromatic data<br/>&gt; gathered by the cones into w/k, r/g, and y/b channels, &quot;the mind<br/>&gt; never &apos;sees&apos; the trichromatic outputs.&quot;  8-O</p><p>Yes. But that&apos;s kind of a funny way of putting it. Why should the last<br/>layer of retinal neurons be considered any less a part of the &quot;mind&quot;<br/>than the first layer of cortical ones they transmit to? I find that a<br/>combination of buddhist psychology (e.g. Ken Wilber&apos;s &quot;No Boundary&quot;)<br/>and materialist philosophy (Daniel Dennett&apos;s &quot;Consciousness<br/>Explained&quot;) helps me to understand this. But now I&apos;m getting way off<br/>topic.</p><p>&gt; Cute!  But why not make that second line something like this:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Each hears notes in all (s)he sees.</p><p>Good idea.</p><p>As we live a life of ease<br/>we hear music in all we see<br/>skyE of blue and C of green<br/>in our yellow suBbmarine</p><p>Thanks Paul McCartney.</p><p>-- Dave Keenan</p></div>
