I&apos;ll have to<br/>confess that I haven&apos;t done much work in 88CET or any other unusual tuning<br/>in the past two years.  I&apos;ve been learning the saxophone so that I can use<br/>my WX-11 MIDI wind controller (which plays kinda like a saxophone) more<br/>effectively in future microtonal work.  Hopefully with a less stiff<br/>performance, along with the vastly better sampling material I&apos;ve been<br/>recording recently, the ASR-10 won&apos;t sound so &quot;bad&quot;.</p><p>   But I need to also move on to work less oriented toward simulation of<br/>&quot;real&quot; instruments.  I&apos;ve come to realize that electronic simulation of<br/>acoustic instruments is almost musical suicide.  The more accurate the<br/>instrument simulation is without being exactly perfect, the more it annoys<br/>people!  I guess it&apos;s kinda like drawing human figures;  people enjoy<br/>cartoons as obviously-inaccurate representations of humans, but if we give<br/>people the impression that we claim that a drawing is photographically<br/>accurate, people get very very picky about it.</p><p>   But anyway, although I started exploring 88CET five years ago, I&apos;ve<br/>really only explored it for about three years.  So I&apos;ll keep at it a few<br/>more years, but definitely move on in time.</p><p>   Thanks again, Carl, for reviewing the CD.  By the way, tell us more<br/>about your concern that &quot;Snake Dance&quot; sounded &quot;interesting but<br/>unconvincing&quot;.</p></div><h3><a id=159 href="#159">ðŸ”—</a>bram &#x3C;bram@gawth.com&#x3E;</h3><span>1/6/1999 3:17:31 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>On Wed, 6 Jan 1999, Gary Morrison wrote:</p><p>&gt;    But I need to also move on to work less oriented toward simulation of<br/>&gt; &quot;real&quot; instruments.

The more accurate the<br/>&gt; instrument simulation is without being exactly perfect, the more it annoys<br/>&gt; people!</p><p>I find the practice of trying to make electronic instruments sound like<br/>&apos;real&apos; things somewhat puzzling. To my ear, electronic instruments are<br/>generally much nicer-sounding and versatile than acoustic ones. (Granted,<br/>I&apos;m young enough that I wasn&apos;t subjected to years of cheap tinny sounding<br/>electronic synths.)</p><p>It is true that it&apos;s very difficult to make *exact* reproductions of<br/>many acoustic instruments using electronic means, but if one is to play<br/>this argument in reverse, and try to make electronic-sounding effects<br/>using acoustic instrumentation, the comparison is just silly. Even more<br/>puzzling to me is how people seem fond of the *exact* details of the<br/>original instrument, criticizing the electronic duplicate for not having<br/>some artifacts of the original which are of dubious value musically.</p><p>My own rather ears, which have been informally trained on large amounts of<br/>techno, and can pick out electronic timbres very well, find many<br/>traditional instruments to be of dubious quality to begin with. For<br/>example, while I love the rich sound of a grand piano, smaller pianos<br/>sound very cheap to me. Likewise, &apos;classical&apos; guitars sound very good to<br/>my ear, but regular &apos;acoustic&apos; ones just sound like cheap knockoffs of<br/>their very pure-sounding and versatile electric cousins.</p><p>-Bram</p></div><h3><a id=172 href="#172">ðŸ”—</a>Kraig Grady &#x3C;kraiggrady@anaphoria.com&#x3E;</h3><span>1/6/1999 11:04:10 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>bram wrote:</p><p>&gt; From: bram &lt;<a href="mailto:bram@gawth.com">bram@gawth.com</a>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I find the practice of trying to make electronic instruments sound like<br/>&gt; &apos;real&apos; things somewhat puzzling.

If one were<br/>to make a 16-track recording of powwow drummers, arrange speakers<br/>specifically for that performance, and arrange one&apos;s living room to have<br/>the appropriate acoustics, I&apos;m sure the effect would be amazing. As it is,<br/>I can&apos;t really even afford to blow $2000 on a halfway decent subwoofer<br/>(not to mention that my downstairs neigbors might not appreciate it very<br/>much.) The relative economy of pre-recorded music is the primary (and, in<br/>my opinion, entirely reasonable,) cause of the ongoing decline in live<br/>performances.</p><p>With regards to a single electronic timbre getting boring quickly, almost<br/>none of the heavily electonic music I really like sticks to a single<br/>timbre throughout an entire song. In fact, it&apos;s rare for it to stick to a<br/>single timbre through an entire measure. I wouldn&apos;t recommend trying to<br/>sort through random instrumental electronic things trying to find examples<br/>though - the accessibility of electronic music has produced a lot of<br/>schlock, although by the same token it&apos;s also allowed a few people with<br/>true talent to produce some very good things with very little resources.</p><p>-Bram</p></div><h3><a id=175 href="#175">ðŸ”—</a>Patrick Pagano &#x3C;ppagano@bellsouth.net&#x3E;</h3><span>1/6/1999 5:41:46 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>I&apos;ve stood a little too close to shak players a got a headful of neo-zen spittle<br/>all over me.<br/>Listen to glass,reich or Lamonte Young and then tell me about Trance.

Still as someone who has actually experienced a complete loss of<br/>conscious identity by solely musical means, I have never found to have gotten there<br/>by electronic means. As for the above much minimalism tends to induce much of its<br/>effect initially with its &quot;novelty&apos; fading with repeated listening. On the other<br/>hand, certain musics seem in my experience to build up an accumulated experience. Out<br/>of the above, (replace RILEY instead of glass please!) and their best works are done<br/>on acoustical instruments. The exception with Lamonte Young is his works in EXACT<br/>TUNINGS (where the intervals are pure to the point of creating standing waves). Erv<br/>and co. have done such experiments out here. Frankly it makes me not want to move.<br/>Maybe in the future they&apos;ll use it for riot control!<br/>    Descending Moonshine Dervishes will always be my favorite Riley piece. I was only<br/>mildly impressed at first but find it more and more enjoyable with years.
