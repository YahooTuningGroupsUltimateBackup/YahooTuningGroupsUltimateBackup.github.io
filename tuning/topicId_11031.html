Pascal&apos;s triangle, you may know, begins with a 1 and<br/>each entry below that is the sum of the two entries above it<br/>(assuming a sea of zeros where there are no numbers). Hence:</p><p>                                 1<br/>                               1   1<br/>                             1   2   1<br/>                           1   3   3   1<br/>                         1   4   6   4   1<br/>                       1   5   10  10  5   1<br/>                     1   6   15  20  15  6   1</p><p>The kth number (counting the first as zero) in the nth row (again<br/>counting the first as zero) is known mathematically as &quot;n choose k&quot;,<br/>or the number of ways of choosing k objects out of a total of n. This<br/>mathematical function is known as the &quot;combination&quot; (hence the first<br/>word in &quot;Combination Product Set). It is symbolized by</p><p>(n)<br/>( )<br/>(k),</p><p>except that there should be one big left parenthesis instead of<br/>three, and one big right parenthesis instead of three. How does<br/>Pascal&apos;s triangle work to give you this information? Well, let&apos;s say<br/>you already know the number of ways of choosing k-1 objects out of n-<br/>1 objects is</p><p>(n-1)<br/>(   )<br/>(k-1),</p><p>and that the number of ways of choosing k objects out of n-1 objects<br/>is</p><p>(n-1)<br/>(   )<br/>( k ).</p><p>Now let&apos;s say you add one new object to your universe, so now you<br/>have a total of n. How many ways are there to choose k objects now?<br/>Well, you can either choose k objects out of the n-1 you had before,<br/>and there are</p><p>(n-1)<br/>(   )<br/>( k )</p><p>ways of doing that; or you can choose the new object along with k-1<br/>objects out of the n-1 you had before, and there are</p><p>(n-1)<br/>(   )<br/>(k-1)</p><p>ways of doing that. So the total number of possibilities is the sum<br/>of those two numbers; i.e.,</p><p>(n)   (n-1)   (n-1)<br/>( ) = (   ) + (   )<br/>(k)   (k-1)   ( k ).</p><p>So given the facts that there is only 1 way to choose no objects and<br/>only 1 way to choose all the objects; i.e.,</p><p>(n)       (n)<br/>( ) = 1,  ( ) = 1,<br/>(0)       (n)</p><p>we have the outer &quot;shell&quot; of ones of Pascal&apos;s triangle; the previous<br/>formula fills out the interior.</p><p>Now look at <a href="http://www.anaphoria.com/dal16.html">http://www.anaphoria.com/dal16.html</a> again. Note that the<br/>figures are arranged in a triangle. Count the number of &quot;dots&quot; in<br/>each figure. It&apos;s Pascal&apos;s triangle!</p><p>Okay, so what about the shapes? Let&apos;s take the fourth row (n=3) as an<br/>example, since it&apos;s simple but not so simple as to be &quot;degenerate&quot;.<br/>The three &quot;objects&quot; are the multiplicative factors A, B, and C. The<br/>first &quot;dot&quot; on the left represents the set obtained by multiplying no<br/>factors, which Wilson represents with the symbol for the empty set,<br/>an &quot;O&quot; with a slash through it. He also writes the symbol</p><p>(0)<br/>( )<br/>(3)</p><p>to mean the mathematical operation 3-choose-0 (he&apos;s got it upside-<br/>down relative to me): you&apos;re choosing zero elements out of a set of<br/>3. Since 3-choose-0 equals 1 (as you can read off Pascal&apos;s triangle),<br/>Erv writes a &quot;1&quot; near the dot as well. The result of choosing zero<br/>factors out of three is a 1-note &quot;scale&quot;, which Erv calls a &quot;monany&quot;.</p><p>The next shape (representing 3-choose-1, which equals 3) after the<br/>dot is a triangle:</p><p>   B<br/>  / \<br/> /   \<br/>A-----C</p><p>Choosing 1 element at a time out of 3 leads to three possible<br/>products, namely the factors themselves: A, B, and C. This three-note<br/>set Erv calls a &quot;Triany&quot; but it&apos;s really just a triad. Here Erv has<br/>implicitly chosen to represent each of the &quot;consonant&quot; ratios A/C,<br/>A/B, and B/C, by horizontal, upward-sloping, and downward-sloping<br/>lines, respectively. This choice will hold through the rest of the<br/>row.</p><p>The next shape is the upside-down triangle for 3-choose-2 = 3:</p><p>A*B---B*C<br/>  \   /<br/>   \ /<br/>   A*C</p><p>Clearly, each note in this triad comes from choosing two elements out<br/>of the set and multiplying them together (thus the second word<br/>of &quot;Combination Product Set&quot;). How does the configuration of these<br/>notes come about? Well, note that the interval (remember, intervals<br/>are _ratios_) between A*B and B*C is</p><p>A*B   A<br/>--- = -<br/>B*C   C,</p><p>and we have already chosen the horizontal line to represent the<br/>interval A/C, with the numerator on the left end of the line and the<br/>denominator on the right end. Similarly, the other two, diagonal<br/>lines, represent the same interval, in the same orientation, as they<br/>did in the previous triange. Check for yourself!</p><p>Finally, we come to 3-choose-3, where there is only one note,<br/>obtained by multiplying all the elements: A*B*C. Since it is only one<br/>note, it is really the same as the 3-choose-0 CPS: there is only one<br/>kind of monany, but we&apos;ve seen two kinds of trianies.</p><p>Now let&apos;s make this a little more concrete by assigning values to the<br/>factors (you can assign any values you like, but I will deal with the<br/>most familiar and useful case). A, B, and C will be 1, 3, and 5<br/>(we&apos;ll allow factors of 2 for free due to octave equivalence). The<br/>monanies are not very interesting, but the trianies are none other<br/>than our familiar major and minor triad. The first one is 1:3:5, or<br/>4:6:5, or the JI major triad; the second one is 1*3:1*5:3*5, or<br/>3:5:15, or 12:10:15, or the JI minor triad.</p><p>The same logic applies to each row of the Figure 19<br/>(<a href="http://www.anaphoria.com/dal16.html">http://www.anaphoria.com/dal16.html</a>). The next row contains the<br/>major tetrad and minor tetrad, and the hexany, which I&apos;ve already<br/>discussed quite a bit in the context of the four factors being 1, 3,<br/>5, and 7. The following row shows pentads and dekanies; if we choose<br/>1, 3, 5, 7, and 9 as our factors, the pentads are the complete otonal<br/>and utonal chords of 9-limit harmony, and the dekanies are<br/>interesting scales that you should work out for yourself as an<br/>exercise. Note that in these diagrams and those in the next (and<br/>last) row, not all the connecting lines (i.e., consonant intervals)<br/>are drawn in by Erv; for example, in the 5-factor case he shows A/E<br/>with a line but not B/D. One potentially confusing thing is that the<br/>direction of A/E is parallel to that of B/D; hence sometimes these<br/>intervals may overlap on the lattice diagram. So by only drawing some<br/>of the lines, Erv staves off potentially confusing overlapping lines<br/>by omitting lines for certain consonant intervals (fully half of them<br/>in the 5-factor case, and two-thirds of them in the 6-factor case --<br/>you will see the omitted lines as dotted lines in certain other<br/>figures in the D&apos;Alessandro paper).</p><p>Other than that, the orientations of the factors are simply chosen to<br/>produce pretty, symmetrical shapes in which at least some of the<br/>important intervallic and chordal relationships can be readily seen.<br/>Here&apos;s a test: in the central diagram on the bottom, the Eikosany,<br/>can you find the 30 consonant tetrads that Carl was referring to?<br/>Each consonant tetrad will be configured exactly like either four out<br/>of the six notes of the major hexad (the 1-out-of-6 CPS), or four out<br/>of the six notes of the minor hexad (the 5-out-of-6 CPS). Recopying<br/>the figure bigger and drawing in the dotted lines (as suggested by<br/>the hexads in <a href="http://www.anaphoria.com/dal14.html">http://www.anaphoria.com/dal14.html</a>) may help if you<br/>have trouble. (Hint: of all the possible ways of taking four of the<br/>six notes of the major hexad, and of all the possible ways of taking<br/>four of the six notes of the minor hexad, the Eikosany will have<br/>exactly one example of each -- 6-choose-4 is 15, and 15+15=30). If<br/>this is too hard, go back to the hexany and show yourself how its 8<br/>consonant triads (the ones that look like triangles with a note at<br/>each vertex) are one each of the 4 possible ways of taking a triad<br/>out of the major tetrad, and one each of the 4 possible ways of<br/>taking a triad out of the minor tetrad. Then come back to the<br/>Eikosany. If you want to &quot;cheat&quot;, look at the factors that make up<br/>the notes of the Eikosany (3 factors for each note) -- each consonant<br/>otonal tetrad will have two factors in common to all notes (e.g.,<br/>A*B*C, A*B*D, A*B*E, A*B*F), and each utonal tetrad will have two<br/>factors absent from all notes (e.g., A*B*C, A*B*D, A*C*D, B*C*D).</p><p>_________________________________________________</p><p>We have moved!</p><p>As of June 26, 2000, Acadian Asset Management will be at a<br/>new location in Boston&apos;s financial district.</p><p>Please contact us at:<br/>Acadian Asset Management<br/>Ten Post Office Square, 8th Floor<br/>Boston, MA  02109.</p><p>All phone, fax and email remain the same.</p></div>
