But I&apos;ll repost it here for tidiness, &gt; modified to be slightly clearer:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; ____________________________________________________________________________<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Rick has been talking recently about how maybe we&apos;re hearing 3 steps &gt; of 12tet as being an only slightly out-of-tune 19/16 ratio rather than &gt; a really out-of-tune 6/5 ratio. 19/16, however, has an entirely &gt; different /*character*/ than 6/5. Which begs the question: what ARE we &gt; hearing? What is the nature of this change in character, and what does &gt; this character mean?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; What is it that we hear when we hear a 12tet major chord? Often this &gt; chord is cited as having a relatively in-tune 3/2 and a slightly &gt; out-of-tune 5/4... But is there some other way that we are really &gt; hearing it?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Do we psychologically &quot;move&quot; these ratios to the nearest JI one, or &gt; the simplest one, or...?  If I play a JI minor chord with the minor &gt; third as 19/16 am I hearing THAT as an out of tune 6/5?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I think the context of it might matter. There is definitely some &gt; difference between 11-tet and 12-tet, for example. 12-tet offers &gt; better &quot;matches&quot; to intervals in the harmonic series. So to SOME &gt; extent, imposing some kind of JI-related structure on equal &gt; temperaments offers useful results.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Take the following 2 chords:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; 1:2:3:4:5:6<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; and<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; 100:200:300:400:504:600<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; You will still most likely hear the resemblence to the overtone series &gt; and hear that context superimposed over the second chord. The &gt; sharpened &quot;5&quot; will cause some beating that you may or may not like, &gt; depending on the context. I hear the second one as &quot;vibrant,&quot; &gt; &quot;exciting,&quot; etc. You might also view it as &quot;dissonant&quot; and an &gt; &quot;out-of-tune&quot; version of 1:2:3:4:5:6. However, you might ALSO view &gt; that second chord as an &quot;inversion&quot; of a completely different JI &gt; chord, which would presumably act in a different way if you take into &gt; account the &quot;traditional&quot; ways that chord inversions and such are &gt; viewed - and these ways were groundbreaking in their own time and &gt; evolved out of their own realizations.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I.E.: the two approaches give differing results, and thus something in &gt; the overall theory is inconsistent. All known musical truths will &gt; never be accessible through any axiomatic system - but it might be &gt; useful to at least make the current one consistent. As I see it (and I &gt; feel this is a fairly common perspective), the way many of us have &gt; been taught music theory in school fails to explain microtonal theory &gt; (see above for the b9 example), and the way many of us currently see &gt; microtonal theory fails to explain good ol&apos; fashioned 12tet music &gt; theory from school (the areas in which it DOES work). If these two &gt; could be reconciled, I think it would be good.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; So to restate the question:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Why do we sometimes hear intervals &quot;guided&quot; to their nearest match in &gt; a harmonic series, and why do we sometimes hear them as new entities &gt; in their own right with different feelings and characters to them?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Or, in a more general sense, what causes someone to hear a certain &gt; interval as a mistuned form of another interval?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; OR, in its /broadest/ sense, what causes someone, when experiencing a &gt; phenomenon, to view that phenomenon as an altered version of another &gt; phenomenon?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Sometimes we get into &quot;well the brain does this&quot; or &quot;the brain does &gt; that,&quot; and I think those answers often fall short of the truth.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; -Mike<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;</p></div><h3>Mike Battaglia &#x3C;battaglia01@...&#x3E;</h3><span>6/7/2008 6:08:50 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>&gt;  David Doty wrote a fine book to teach JI.

I believe that if you<br/>&gt; ask a question, you ought to be prepared to hear an answer.<br/>&gt; Not everyone is like that though. In particular, some schools<br/>&gt; of philosophy have carved out a niche by asking questions and<br/>&gt; being forever unsatisfied with answers of any kind. That&apos;s<br/>&gt; apparently good enough to get by in some university departments<br/>&gt; but it won&apos;t cut the mustard here. So let me first ask you<br/>&gt; if you can imagine a hypothetical answer that would satisfy<br/>&gt; you. In other words: what form of answer are you looking for?<br/>&gt; If you can imagine being satisfied by *some* answer, let me<br/>&gt; know what shape that answer might hav and I can check if the<br/>&gt; answer that satisfies me might also satisfy you. If I think<br/>&gt; it does I&apos;ll let you know and I&apos;m happy to try to explain it<br/>&gt; to you. You&apos;re still under no obligation to like it of course.<br/>&gt; If it doesn&apos;t, then I can let you know that your question is<br/>&gt; still an open problem and maybe we can pursue afresh.</p><p>I don&apos;t understand what you mean. I don&apos;t know what the answer is.<br/>What is the answer you have arrived at? I have a few different ideas,<br/>but I&apos;m not sure which one it is.</p><p>My current guess is that a human being has to be &quot;shown&quot; the way that<br/>a new tone could fit in a chord somehow, or else he/she will be apt to<br/>hear it as a mistuning of something they already know. I think that<br/>the cognitive labeling of it as such is something that changes over<br/>the course of a lifetime - babies are likely to be much more open to<br/>it, adults less so, but older adults perhaps more so again.</p><p>Sorry, I&apos;m still waking up right now - my brain&apos;s kind of fried. I&apos;ll<br/>restate it more precisely once I get the ol motor fired up.</p><p>&gt; Absolutely. But they all play in 12! Their astonishing ears<br/>&gt; have the benefit of centuries of music theory in the form of<br/>&gt; the instruments they play, and the music they hear around them.</p><p>Absolutely. They know the &quot;intuitive&quot; aspects of music theory. I<br/>suppose what I am trying to do here is to take all of the jumble of<br/>theory ideas that have accumulated over centuries and find places<br/>where there are holes. My above example about how my teacher said I<br/>have to avoid b9&apos;s and such over any note except for the root is one<br/>of them. He is right in some cases, not others, and furthermore, WHY<br/>is that the case? What is it about a tempered b9 that&apos;s going to cause<br/>this? I would really like to know why, and I don&apos;t think there is<br/>anything wrong with that.</p><p>Musicians often say that it&apos;s bad to ask &quot;why.&quot; They say that it&apos;s<br/>just better to accept and listen. While when you play, it definitely<br/>is better to accept and listen, there is also no harm in asking &quot;why.&quot;</p><p>&gt; We have jazz because the piano embodies a very powerful music<br/>&gt; theory. Drop it in front of someone who isn&apos;t boxed in by<br/>&gt; the existing repertoire and you&apos;ll get wonders. But no such<br/>&gt; instruments exist for microtonal music. With the possible<br/>&gt; exception of refretted guitars. But you still have to know<br/>&gt; which divisions to pick.</p><p>Exactly! That is why I&apos;m frustrated. I want to bring microtonality to<br/>jazz, and to the songwriters, and to the rock musicians and the little<br/>kids. I want to come up with a way that makes it easy for musicians<br/>out there to get into this stuff. It is extremely hard to do that<br/>right now for a variety of reasons:</p><p>1) Different tuning systems need to be weighed to find out which ones<br/>are best suited for the task. The ideal candidate will be easy to<br/>adjust to, easy to understand, and expressive in its harmonic output.<br/>72tet might be the candidate. It&apos;s a great system, in my opinion, but<br/>you can forget about ever making a 72tet guitar (unless it&apos;s<br/>fretless). And we need 72tet trumpets and saxes and horns with extra<br/>keys and such to get that rolling.</p><p>As for a 72tet keyboard... I haven&apos;t found one that I really like yet,<br/>except for the &quot;Z-board&quot; i think it&apos;s called was pretty decent.</p><p>2) There is currently a lot of math and such involved if you even want<br/>to start playing around with this stuff at all. Assuming you go the<br/>Partch/harmonic series route, you might first get into higher-limit<br/>JI, and JI is math, hah. Another common notion is that 31tet or 53tet<br/>or 72tet are just too many &quot;notes&quot; to deal with per octave, when that<br/>isn&apos;t really how it works.</p><p>So I suppose the science of pedagogy has to be brought into it.</p><p>I had some more reasons, but as stated above, my brain is dead right<br/>now. I was going to say something along the lines of how 31tet might<br/>not be the best idea for specifically &quot;jazz&quot; as it gains better 3rds<br/>at the cost of its fifths, and so all of the quartal voicings that we<br/>know and love will sound pretty warbly. I remember minor 9 chords<br/>being like that.</p><p>&gt; We&apos;re just starting to see keyboards<br/>&gt; arrive and it will take a generation or two to get the first<br/>&gt; William Byrd. You could say Scott Joplin was the Byrd of jazz,<br/>&gt; Tatum the Bach, and Monk the Beethoven.</p><p>And Bill Evans the Debussy, and Herbie the Liszt.</p><p>&gt; As stated in my previous message, I think if you compare the<br/>&gt; music of quartertone composers, or microtonal musicians who<br/>&gt; aren&apos;t using the theory of Partch, Erv Wilson, or the &quot;regular<br/>&gt; mapping paradigm&quot; of this list (which includes the theories<br/>&gt; of Partch and Wilson), or something similar... if you compare<br/>&gt; that stuff with the output of people who ARE using those<br/>&gt; theories... you&apos;ll find it sucks in comparison. That&apos;s my<br/>&gt; opinion anyway, and I&apos;d be interested if you agree. I can<br/>&gt; point you to mp3s if you like.</p><p>I agree as well. I think that&apos;s because &quot;music&quot; to us, as we live in a<br/>western culture, is very harmonic in nature and thus related to the<br/>harmonic series. Partch and Wilson simply expanded the small range of<br/>the harmonic series that we were using, and so it sounds like an<br/>&quot;extension&quot; of the stuff we already know. When I listen to<br/>&quot;quartertone composers,&quot; they usually don&apos;t strike me as having that<br/>same harmonic quality to them, and so the stuff is more atonal - and<br/>while it&apos;s often great anyway, it&apos;s only one possible flavor of what&apos;s<br/>possible.</p><p>Please do point me to some MP3&apos;s. I&apos;ve heard only a handful of<br/>examples that I really like - a few songs off of Easley Blackwood&apos;s<br/>Etudes did it for me, but there&apos;s this Joel Mandelbaum piece on<br/>youtube that is awesome, and Aaron Johnson has some amazing songs too<br/>(I always liked Melancholic). Hook it up!</p><p>&gt; Yes. And the way to do it is by building new instruments<br/>&gt; and creating inspiring music and having a group of theorists<br/>&gt; who are happy to field questions.</p><p>And changing the way theory is taught in schools so that it comes from<br/>the perspective of music IN 12tet, not that 12tet is all that there<br/>is.</p><p>-Mike</p></div><h3>Mike Battaglia &#x3C;battaglia01@...&#x3E;</h3><span>6/7/2008 7:26:07 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>&gt; Much of the work on the tuning-math list is centered around the idea of<br/>&gt; building a unified system that encompasses JI, ET, and everything in<br/>&gt; between.

It&apos;s a great system, in my opinion, but<br/>&gt; you can forget about ever making a 72tet guitar (unless it&apos;s<br/>&gt; fretless). And we need 72tet trumpets and saxes and horns with extra<br/>&gt; keys and such to get that rolling.</p><p>A blackjack guitar, tuned to 72tet, is perfectly viable.  I don&apos;t remember if anybody has one yet.  Guitars are all we need for rock music.  Most orchestral instruments are already very flexible with regards to pitch and quartertone instruments all the better for reaching arbitrary intervals.</p><p>Still, blackjack isn&apos;t my ideal guitar fretting.  It&apos;s a bit too complicated.  But I&apos;m very interested in magic19 -- see below.</p><p>&gt; As for a 72tet keyboard... I haven&apos;t found one that I really like yet,<br/>&gt; except for the &quot;Z-board&quot; i think it&apos;s called was pretty decent.</p><p>Blackjack (miracle21) can work on a remapped halberstadt. Not ideal by any means but enough to explore the territory.   For a performance you may even find you don&apos;t need that many notes and you can use a special case mapping with exactly the ones you need.</p><p>I have a pipe dream of a miracle ensemble.  Each instrument plays a different subset of canasta (miracle31) or 72tet if you like.  Some will play &quot;pygmy&quot; pentatonics, with chains of approximate 8:7s.  Six of those can handle 30 notes between them.  Some instruments will play mohajira (7 notes generated by neutral thirds).  Three such cover the 21 notes of blackjack.  Some instruments will handle the full decimal scale, and four such give canasta with a bit of overlap. Maybe some of the instruments will be able to handle the full 31 note gamut.  But the idea is to share the notes around so that each instrument and each instrumental part is relatively simple.</p><p>It helps that miracle breaks down into some interesting subsets.  Pygmy pentatonics and mohajira are good, simple scales in their own right.  Great for musicians who find 12tet already has too many notes.</p><p>&gt; 2) There is currently a lot of math and such involved if you even want<br/>&gt; to start playing around with this stuff at all. Assuming you go the<br/>&gt; Partch/harmonic series route, you might first get into higher-limit<br/>&gt; JI, and JI is math, hah. Another common notion is that 31tet or 53tet<br/>&gt; or 72tet are just too many &quot;notes&quot; to deal with per octave, when that<br/>&gt; isn&apos;t really how it works.</p><p>The &quot;too many notes&quot; argument is why I use linear temperaments.  Miracle works fine with 21 notes.  You only need to teach those 21 notes.  Sure, it&apos;s more complicated than 12 notes, but the more adventurous musicians can handle it.  It has some really cool intervals.  You can teach it much the way you do any other super-scale -- nice chords, nasty chords, scales, melodies.  There are more consonances to remember but that&apos;s the whole point.</p><p>Magic works with only 19 notes and you can do a fair bit with 16.  That means it isn&apos;t significantly more complex than meantone in the 7-limit.  It doesn&apos;t naturally break down into simpler scales but I&apos;ve cracked the notation problem now.  It naturally supports chords built by chaining thirds.  There are more of them than in 12tet and more ways of connecting them but not so difficult compared to the outer reaches of jazz harmony.</p><p>In both cases you can tie chords to the harmonic series if you want to.  If your students object to that you can talk about different thirds: subminor-minor-neutral-major-supermajor.</p><p>&gt; So I suppose the science of pedagogy has to be brought into it.</p><p>Experience is what we need.  Experience of making music and experience of passing the knowledge to other musicians.</p><p>&gt; I had some more reasons, but as stated above, my brain is dead right<br/>&gt; now. I was going to say something along the lines of how 31tet might<br/>&gt; not be the best idea for specifically &quot;jazz&quot; as it gains better 3rds<br/>&gt; at the cost of its fifths, and so all of the quartal voicings that we<br/>&gt; know and love will sound pretty warbly. I remember minor 9 chords<br/>&gt; being like that.</p><p>I agree that meantone (of which 31tet is almost optimal) doesn&apos;t work for 9th chords.  That&apos;s why I draw a distinction between 7-limit and 9-limit temperaments. Meantone is, to me, a 7-limit temperament.  Magic (22&amp;19) is the simplest 9-limit temperament.  So for mainstream jazz harmony the next step is magic.  I&apos;ve got 19 notes tuned up now, and they work well enough.  It means chords sound familiar but smoother than in 12tet.  For mainstream harmony the problem is that you can&apos;t chain many fifths before you run off the edge.  For me the problem is that I miss those spicy 11-limit intervals.  There are some approximate 11:8s though and one neutral third!</p><p>If you want more fifths the solution seems to be schismatic/garibaldi (12&amp;29).  29 notes work well enough and fit a halberstadt layout although it&apos;s a stretch.  It is more complex than magic.  Maybe the familiarity of a fifth generator will make up for that.  It&apos;s the great neverwozzer of temperament classes -- implied in theories of different cultures but never properly taken up.</p><p>For more exotic intervals or more accuracy the answer is miracle.  It looked like the holy grail of 11-limit harmony when it was re-discovered in 2001 and I don&apos;t think any recent developments have changed that.</p><p>You may also have a look at orwell (22&amp;31).  It doesn&apos;t have a unique selling point in the 9-limit but it&apos;s similar to the other ones I mentioned and simpler than miracle in the 11-limit.</p><p>&gt;&gt; As stated in my previous message, I think if you compare the<br/>&gt;&gt; music of quartertone composers, or microtonal musicians who<br/>&gt;&gt; aren&apos;t using the theory of Partch, Erv Wilson, or the &quot;regular<br/>&gt;&gt; mapping paradigm&quot; of this list (which includes the theories<br/>&gt;&gt; of Partch and Wilson), or something similar... if you compare<br/>&gt;&gt; that stuff with the output of people who ARE using those<br/>&gt;&gt; theories... you&apos;ll find it sucks in comparison. That&apos;s my<br/>&gt;&gt; opinion anyway, and I&apos;d be interested if you agree. I can<br/>&gt;&gt; point you to mp3s if you like.<br/>&gt; &gt; I agree as well. I think that&apos;s because &quot;music&quot; to us, as we live in a<br/>&gt; western culture, is very harmonic in nature and thus related to the<br/>&gt; harmonic series. Partch and Wilson simply expanded the small range of<br/>&gt; the harmonic series that we were using, and so it sounds like an<br/>&gt; &quot;extension&quot; of the stuff we already know. When I listen to<br/>&gt; &quot;quartertone composers,&quot; they usually don&apos;t strike me as having that<br/>&gt; same harmonic quality to them, and so the stuff is more atonal - and<br/>&gt; while it&apos;s often great anyway, it&apos;s only one possible flavor of what&apos;s<br/>&gt; possible.</p><p>We don&apos;t all live in a western culture :-P</p><p>My rather hubristic opinion is that although I&apos;m not even a competent musician I do have a great theory.  And that theory&apos;s good enough to lead me to some worthwhile music if nobody gets there first.  It&apos;s naturally difficult to interest musicians without musical examples.</p><p>                     Graham</p></div><h3>Mike Battaglia &#x3C;battaglia01@...&#x3E;</h3><span>6/7/2008 10:54:09 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>&gt; You&apos;ve asked these general questions here several times in<br/>&gt; several different messages. I&apos;m trying to figure out why you<br/>&gt; keep asking them without modification, despite that I think<br/>&gt; I&apos;ve already tried to answer them. And why don&apos;t answers of<br/>&gt; the form &apos;the brain does such and such&apos; satisfy you? Because<br/>&gt; those are the kind of answers I tend to give.</p><p>Sorry, I don&apos;t remember your answering them in previous threads. But<br/>rather than bicker back and forth forever about this, let me just<br/>clarify what I am asking:</p><p>The paradigm in which the &quot;brain&quot; is solely responsible for these<br/>effects, while useful for part of the answer, is incomplete because it<br/>ignores the huge role that psychology plays in music.</p><p>If I go and play, let&apos;s say, Pachelbel&apos;s Canon in 5-limit just (I&apos;ve<br/>heard this done before), then let&apos;s say when the A major chord goes to<br/>B minor (a root movement of a minor whole tone), a lot of people who<br/>aren&apos;t used to the sound find that root movement particularly<br/>offensive.</p><p>What is happening is that they hear it as a &quot;flat&quot; or &quot;out-of-tune&quot;<br/>version of the tempered version. They don&apos;t hear it as a new entity in<br/>its own right. What causes this?</p><p>And the reason I don&apos;t think the answer lies SOLELY within the &quot;brain&quot;<br/>is that babies, for example, are much more likely to view new things<br/>as actually being &quot;new&quot; rather than as altered versions of previously<br/>experienced things.</p><p>I think that the temperament (no pun intended) of the individual has a<br/>lot to do with how open they are to new forms of music and the like.<br/>In fact, I think the direct answers to these questions are probably<br/>psychological or even spiritual in nature and have nothing to do with<br/>music. My specific question is how much of the way this works is the<br/>&quot;brain,&quot; and how much is the person&apos;s bias? How does that work, what<br/>is that fine line, and how do the two elements interplay?</p><p>&gt; Cause what? You seem to be saying the rule doesn&apos;t hold.<br/>&gt; If that&apos;s the case then there&apos;s nothing to explain.</p><p>It does hold. If you play C E G Bb D F that F will sound pretty &quot;weak&quot;<br/>in a straight ahead jazz context, although in modern forms of jazz<br/>where experimentation is law then that chord is fairly common. There<br/>are situations where a b9 over the m3 in a minor chord will sound<br/>good, although that might be better expressed as a #8, and the two may<br/>only be enharmonically equivalent in 12tet. So is it only b9&apos;s...? Is<br/>it a certain JI interval here that is causing this phenomenon?</p><p>I don&apos;t know why equal tempered b9&apos;s often sound weak if played over<br/>something that isn&apos;t the root. I suspect the answer has to do<br/>something with beat frequencies that interfere with the stability of<br/>the chord, but I&apos;m not sure why. But it would be nice to elucidate<br/>concepts like that so that in schools they are taught with more<br/>clarity.</p><p>&gt; If you want to take jazz chords and retune them (in JI or some<br/>&gt; other way), that&apos;s a very powerful paradigm to work in and it<br/>&gt; could keep lots of people busy for a long time. But you can<br/>&gt; only ever come up with a small fraction of what&apos;s possible in<br/>&gt; microtonality that way.</p><p>It&apos;s more that I want to develop or utilize a consistent microtonal<br/>system, whether blackjack or 72tet or otherwise, build instruments<br/>using that system, give these instruments to improvisational<br/>musicians, and stand back and watch sparks fly. This field of music is<br/>currently dominated by computer-generated, preplanned compositions as<br/>that is really the only place for now that one can get at that stuff.<br/>It would be amazing to see what this stuff would sound like for on the<br/>spot, improvised music between other musicians... That&apos;s what jazz is<br/>about to me, not so much taking traditional jazz and retuning it to a<br/>different system. Jazz musicians are always in the spirit of<br/>experimenting with new sounds, and I think it would be amazing to give<br/>someone like Ralph Alessi or Kurt Rosenwinkel and their respective<br/>groups access to new sounds like these.</p><p>We are starting to see microtonal keyboards come out, which is<br/>exciting, although for a lot of musicians they are prohibitively<br/>expensive (for me as well right now). But the progress being made is<br/>exciting.</p><p>&gt; It&apos;s more than OK if that&apos;s where you<br/>&gt; want to go but if you really want to explain why 12-ET theory<br/>&gt; is the way it is you may find it very helpful to step outside<br/>&gt; 12-ET theory for a bit.</p><p>Hence my problem with the way music theory is taught in schools. The<br/>b9 over yada yada example above is just the most convenient example of<br/>this I could remember. It screwed my mental model of harmony entirely<br/>up when I heard that &quot;b9 rule&quot; above, as it wasn&apos;t taught in terms of<br/>music, but in terms of 12tet steps.</p><p>&gt; The main thing that&apos;s lacking is the consciousness. For that, nothing beats<br/>&gt; a discrete-pitch generator that a single person can play<br/>&gt; polyphonically, i.e. a keyboard. It gets sounds into the ears,<br/>&gt; hands, and even the eyes (watching a player piano can be<br/>&gt; educational for instance, and generalized keyboards make even<br/>&gt; better music visualizers than the halberstadt).</p><p>Alas, if only they were less expensive...</p><p>&gt; It&apos;s a *generalization* of what we already know. And if you<br/>&gt; do it right, you can indeed explain most everything in common<br/>&gt; practice theory (some things are just down to &quot;frozen<br/>&gt; accidents&quot;).</p><p>Interesting. If work has been done in extending common practice theory<br/>to non-meantone 7- and 11-limit music, I am very interested in seeing<br/>it. How does a 7/6 subminor 7th tetrad fit into common practice<br/>theory? How do 4-part chord voicings and voice leading techniques<br/>extend out to the 7-limit realm, or 5-part techniques out to the<br/>11-limit realm?</p><p>The main place where common practice theory breaks down for me is that<br/>it fails to explain why certain chords are heard the way they are. It<br/>doesn&apos;t explain why the JI Pachelbel&apos;s canon root movement by minor<br/>whole tone from V to vi sounds as weird as it does. This concept of<br/>things sounding &quot;good&quot; or &quot;bad&quot; has been used sometimes in common<br/>practice theory (you aren&apos;t supposed to double the third in a major<br/>chord, for example) because that was felt to destabilize the chord.<br/>Nowadays that doesn&apos;t sound so bad. So I think that rather than add<br/>random corollaries to common practice theory about what sounds good or<br/>bad, we should take the concept up to a higher level of abstraction<br/>and figure out WHY things sound good or bad, and how the psychology<br/>involved works. Obviously it couldn&apos;t be used to generate music, but<br/>it is still something to think about, and would offer an improvement<br/>on the current system.</p></div><h3>Carl Lumma &#x3C;carl@...&#x3E;</h3><span>6/8/2008 12:23:23 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Hi Mike,</p><p>&gt; The paradigm in which the &quot;brain&quot; is solely responsible for<br/>&gt; these effects, while useful for part of the answer, is<br/>&gt; incomplete because it ignores the huge role that psychology<br/>&gt; plays in music.</p><p>Human psychology varies greatly by individual and by trial<br/>(what kind of day you&apos;re having), so it&apos;s difficult to<br/>formalize anything about it in a music theory.</p><p>Another thing that&apos;s usually not formalized are priming<br/>effects -- otherwise known as musical context.  These effects<br/>again will vary by listener and by trial.  In adaptive tuning<br/>schemes, one can treat past notes just like simultaneous<br/>notes but subject to a decay process that weakens the<br/>interactions.  IIRC John deLaubenfels&apos; system did something<br/>like that, and other adaptive tuning schemes probably do<br/>too (my own pet adaptive tuning scheme makes use of it).</p><p>Finally, at the level of cognitive psychology and<br/>psychoacoustics (a branch of cog psy actually), effects are<br/>largely listener-invariant.  So I think it&apos;s a good place<br/>to start.</p><p>&gt; If I go and play, let&apos;s say, Pachelbel&apos;s Canon in 5-limit<br/>&gt; just (I&apos;ve heard this done before), then let&apos;s say when the<br/>&gt; A major chord goes to B minor (a root movement of a minor<br/>&gt; whole tone), a lot of people who aren&apos;t used to the sound<br/>&gt; find that root movement particularly offensive.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; What is happening is that they hear it as a &quot;flat&quot; or<br/>&gt; &quot;out-of-tune&quot; version of the tempered version. They don&apos;t<br/>&gt; hear it as a new entity in its own right. What causes this?</p><p>Assuming that people do complain about this and that it is<br/>because of the smaller whole step, what you have is a<br/>tendency to hear *melodic* intervals in terms of other melodic<br/>intervals.  This is very different from the whole<br/>16:19 v. 6:5 thing.  The theory of harmonic approximation is<br/>on solid footing at this point.  Our understanding of a similar<br/>concept for melodic intervals is more formative.</p><p>However, a guy named David Rothenberg has published papers<br/>about it.  The basic idea is that the human memory can&apos;t cope<br/>with all the pitches in a melody directly, but it can accurately<br/>measure the size of melodic intervals as they come in and deduce<br/>the scale that way.  It hears Adown Bup Aup and it knows the<br/>last note should be B above the first.  The catch is, this is<br/>a skill like riding a bike.  Takes a while to learn but you<br/>never forget.  But you have to do it for every different scale.<br/>Say the diminished scale is a recumbent and Paul Erlich&apos;s<br/>pajara scales are like unicycles.  The first time you get on a<br/>unicycle you might try to ride it like a regular bike, but<br/>you&apos;ll fall on your ass.  You may then complain about unicycles.<br/>But if you practice until you can do it you then may praise<br/>unicycles.</p><p>Rothenberg&apos;s model actually makes predictions.  For example,<br/>as you morph one scale to another (by sliding the pitches<br/>around), it predicts when you&apos;ll start to call it some tuning<br/>of the new scale instead of some tuning of the old.  These<br/>predictions can be tested experimentally, but so far haven&apos;t<br/>been (to my knowledge).</p><p>&gt; &gt; Cause what? You seem to be saying the rule doesn&apos;t hold.<br/>&gt; &gt; If that&apos;s the case then there&apos;s nothing to explain.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; It does hold.</p><p>You gave cases where it doesn&apos;t.  It&apos;s so incredibly easy<br/>to make up music rules that hold sometimes and not others<br/>that they&apos;re usually not worth thinking about.</p><p>&gt; If you play C E G Bb D F that F will sound<br/>&gt; pretty &quot;weak&quot; in a straight ahead jazz context,</p><p>C E G Bb D is a nice 4:5:6:7:9 chord in 12.  The F is<br/>pretty far from the 21 that might sound nice in the chord.</p><p>&gt; although in<br/>&gt; modern forms of jazz where experimentation is law then that<br/>&gt; chord is fairly common.</p><p>Sure, you can use any perception -- positive or negative --<br/>to create a good musical effect.  That doesn&apos;t invalidate<br/>the perception though.</p><p>&gt; There are situations where a b9 over the m3 in a minor<br/>&gt; chord will sound good, although that might be better<br/>&gt; expressed as a #8, and the two may only be enharmonically<br/>&gt; equivalent in 12tet. So is it only b9&apos;s...?  Is it a<br/>&gt; certain JI interval here that is causing this phenomenon?</p><p>I will say that one reason I don&apos;t like the rule is that<br/>it talks about one interval alone without considering the<br/>rest of the intervals in the chord.  When evaluating chords,<br/>generally there are two things I consider: 1. how strong is<br/>the harmonic series interp (e.g. 4:5:7:9) and 2. how many<br/>of the dyads within the chord are consonant.  Both of these<br/>necessitate looking at the *whole chord*, not just which<br/>root some interval is built on top of.</p><p>&gt; It&apos;s more that I want to develop or utilize a consistent<br/>&gt; microtonal system, whether blackjack or 72tet or otherwise,<br/>&gt; build instruments using that system, give these instruments<br/>&gt; to improvisational musicians, and stand back and watch<br/>&gt; sparks fly.</p><p>You and me both.  We could buy a bunch of AXiSes and refretted<br/>guitars and pitch a workshop to Berklee.  I&apos;d bet they&apos;d go<br/>for it.

A<br/>&gt; lot of us are looking for scales with more and more accurate<br/>&gt; consonances. Naturally they end up more complex than<br/>&gt; 12-equal or meantone diatonics. As musicians in general<br/>&gt; have no problems with the scales they know they&apos;ll quite<br/>&gt; rightly ask why they should worry about anything more<br/>&gt; complicated.</p><p>Ah, yeah. Those people might screw around with it if we yelled &quot;HEADS<br/>UP&quot; and forcefully threw a 17- or 19-tone guitar directly at them.<br/>They are also the people least likely to like the way it sounds, as if<br/>these people are already burned into 12-equal, then they&apos;re unlikely<br/>to like the sound of much else short of 36-equal or 72-equal or<br/>something. And those are considerably more difficult to get into.</p><p>&gt; I think a lot of musicians really have no need to go beyond<br/>&gt; what they know and there&apos;s no point in pushing them. A lot<br/>&gt; of musicians, for that matter, have no need for equal<br/>&gt; temperament and are happy with diatonics or even<br/>&gt; pentatonics. But a certain proportion of musicians will be<br/>&gt; able to deal with the additional complexity and in a global<br/>&gt; community there are enough of them to sustain a healthy<br/>&gt; sub-genre. A lot of jazz musicians will fall into this<br/>&gt; category, and prog rockers as well.</p><p>Definitely. There is also an interesting shade of musician that can<br/>deal with the added complexity provided it is explained to them in a<br/>certain way that they don&apos;t have mental defenses against. For me, math<br/>and scientific-sounding theories were never a problem, so I find<br/>what&apos;s going on here to be fascinating. But if I talk about the<br/>overtones and 7-limit music and god forbid I even HINT at something<br/>like &quot;72 notes per octave,&quot; a lot of my friends&apos; minds shut down. And<br/>I&apos;m talking about people who are obviously good at math enough to play<br/>extremely complicated jazz patterns in 16th notes at quarter note =<br/>300, but it&apos;s just that they don&apos;t want to have to think about music<br/>in the way that we often describe it here.</p><p>Some people jump right into that kind of thinking, and some don&apos;t. But<br/>if I gave these people a 31-tone instrument and let them play on it, I<br/>bet they&apos;d come up with extremely interesting sounds and chords that<br/>maybe we wouldn&apos;t have even thought of. Maybe they&apos;d start playing C<br/>Eb G Bb and then see what the difference between that and C D# G A#<br/>is, and &quot;discover&quot; 7-limit music for themselves. Hell, maybe they<br/>wouldn&apos;t even ever know it has anything to do with the 7th overtone,<br/>just like many current musicians don&apos;t know that major chords have<br/>anything to do with the 3rd and fifth overtones.</p><p>&gt; In some cases the increase in complexity is an advantage.<br/>&gt; People are actually looking for more subtlety. Why else<br/>&gt; would the quartertone movement have taken off?</p><p>Yeah, these musicians I&apos;m talking about always want to get started<br/>with quartertones. I always tell them that if that&apos;s what they want<br/>then maybe to try sixth-tones instead, that is, to try 36tet rather<br/>than 24tet. I try to explain that it will allow them better<br/>approximations to the 7th harmonic, whereas quarter tones skips that<br/>and goes up to the 11th harmonic, which is an often weird sound that<br/>they might not like. They ignore me and/or don&apos;t understand and say<br/>&quot;nah man, we&apos;ll do quarter tones first and then we&apos;ll get up to third<br/>tones later.&quot; Then they hear quartertones and they&apos;re like &quot;ahh, this<br/>sucks. I guess I&apos;m just used to 12tet and it&apos;s a cultural thing and it<br/>will never change and blah blah.&quot; Sorry, I&apos;m slightly ranting here.</p><p>&gt; A blackjack guitar, tuned to 72tet, is perfectly viable. I<br/>&gt; don&apos;t remember if anybody has one yet. Guitars are all we<br/>&gt; need for rock music. Most orchestral instruments are<br/>&gt; already very flexible with regards to pitch and quartertone<br/>&gt; instruments all the better for reaching arbitrary intervals.</p><p>Interesting. My beef with non-equal temperaments being used as a<br/>widespread system is just that you can&apos;t write in any key. Maybe it&apos;s<br/>just my bias - I hear different keys as having different colors, and<br/>if every song to come out were in only two or three keys because of a<br/>non-equal system, I&apos;d be really sad. It&apos;s like the only colors you see<br/>for the rest of your life are red. Or, like if any time you saw blue<br/>from then on, it was really dirty blue because blue suddenly has<br/>terrible wolf fifths that threaten the harmonic stability of your<br/>state of mind and the entire world. I may be ranting again.</p><p>Plus, it would be quite difficult to compose Debussy-ish pieces that<br/>use interesting modulations and such. Jazz as well has a history of<br/>composers and songwriters trying to come out with more and more<br/>interesting chord progressions, so that would be limiting there as<br/>well. I&apos;m sure I&apos;m gonna get hammered for clinging to my equal<br/>temperaments on a forum about tuning, but I&apos;ve always had that feeling<br/>about it.</p><p>&gt; I have a pipe dream of a miracle ensemble. Each instrument<br/>&gt; plays a different subset of canasta (miracle31) or 72tet if<br/>&gt; you like. Some will play &quot;pygmy&quot; pentatonics, with chains<br/>&gt; of approximate 8:7s.</p><p>Interesting description. Would 5-equal satisfy what you would call a<br/>&quot;pygmy&quot; pentatonic in one particular key?</p><p>&gt; Six of those can handle 30 notes<br/>&gt; between them. Some instruments will play mohajira (7 notes<br/>&gt; generated by neutral thirds). Three such cover the 21 notes<br/>&gt; of blackjack. Some instruments will handle the full decimal<br/>&gt; scale, and four such give canasta with a bit of overlap.<br/>&gt; Maybe some of the instruments will be able to handle the<br/>&gt; full 31 note gamut. But the idea is to share the notes<br/>&gt; around so that each instrument and each instrumental part is<br/>&gt; relatively simple.</p><p>That&apos;s a really interesting idea - I&apos;d be very interested in hearing<br/>what that would sound like.</p><p>I think it would be worthwhile to put some of these ideas through<br/>Vienna Symphonic Library or EastWest or some &quot;hyper-realistic&quot;<br/>orchestral sample program to hear what this stuff would sound like.<br/>EWQL Ra would undoubtedly be a good idea as well.</p><p>&gt; The &quot;too many notes&quot; argument is why I use linear<br/>&gt; temperaments. Miracle works fine with 21 notes. You only<br/>&gt; need to teach those 21 notes. Sure, it&apos;s more complicated<br/>&gt; than 12 notes, but the more adventurous musicians can handle<br/>&gt; it. It has some really cool intervals. You can teach it<br/>&gt; much the way you do any other super-scale -- nice chords,<br/>&gt; nasty chords, scales, melodies. There are more consonances<br/>&gt; to remember but that&apos;s the whole point.</p><p>That&apos;s a really interesting idea. To teach someone with blackjack and<br/>then have them jump up to canasta and then the 41-note one (I forget<br/>the name now) and then up to 72-equal. That might be a really good way<br/>to teach this stuff.</p><p>Sometimes though, no matter what my friends say about &quot;too many<br/>notes,&quot; I feel like if I gave them 72-equal sax with the full range of<br/>notes, they&apos;d figure it out pretty quickly. They already know to drop<br/>the major third in a horn ensemble so that it sounds closer to a 5/4 -<br/>they would basically then have a key to do that. I also hear them<br/>playing 4:5:6:7 for dominant 7 chords sometimes, but only sometimes -<br/>it&apos;s amazing how many different ways a horn section will approach a C7<br/>chord depending on whether it&apos;s the tonic (mixolydian) or a 5 chord to<br/>a major chord or to a minor chord. But either way, rather than have to<br/>lip that 7 down a third of a half step, they&apos;ll have a key for that.</p><p>And if I ever hear a trumpet play a #11 over a dominant 7 chord,<br/>chances are he&apos;s a full quartertone flat and is hitting 11/4. So<br/>there&apos;d just be a valve for that as well. I find that it&apos;s really easy<br/>to get musicians to adjust to 72-equal if they think of it as just a<br/>formalized system of things they already know. Like maybe as<br/>quartertones with a few intermediate steps that have various uses in<br/>terms of currently existing music. So instead of having to learn<br/>72-12=60 new notes, it becomes much more simple to conceptualize.<br/>Usually the term 72-equal is intimidating, but it doesn&apos;t have to be.<br/>People don&apos;t have to think of all 12 of the notes now when they&apos;re<br/>playing major 7 chords and such.</p><p>I think it would be like they&apos;d stick to 12-equal mostly, then they&apos;d<br/>&quot;wander out&quot; into 72 a little bit by comma-adjusting for major thirds<br/>here and there, and then they&apos;d eventually get comfortable that way.<br/>Then they&apos;ll comma adjust for other things in 72 as well, then try new<br/>chords and modulations and such. Then someone will come along who&apos;s<br/>spent time on it and has learned and invented all kinds of new<br/>symmetric scales, and the bar will be raised, and it could take off<br/>that way as well.</p><p>&gt; Magic works with only 19 notes and you can do a fair bit<br/>&gt; with 16. That means it isn&apos;t significantly more complex<br/>&gt; than meantone in the 7-limit. It doesn&apos;t naturally break<br/>&gt; down into simpler scales but I&apos;ve cracked the notation<br/>&gt; problem now. It naturally supports chords built by chaining<br/>&gt; thirds. There are more of them than in 12tet and more ways<br/>&gt; of connecting them but not so difficult compared to the<br/>&gt; outer reaches of jazz harmony.</p><p>I&apos;ll have to check magic out again. 19-tet is magic, isn&apos;t it? Maybe<br/>19-tet is too limiting for the full range of what magic can do. Or is<br/>magic just the linear temperament generated by dividing 3/1 into 5<br/>equal parts?</p><p>&gt; In both cases you can tie chords to the harmonic series if<br/>&gt; you want to. If your students object to that you can talk<br/>&gt; about different thirds: subminor-minor-neutral-major-supermajor.</p><p>Yeah. I find 31-equal to be a great introduction to the whole thing,<br/>honestly. 19-equal is a decent introduction as well, but the fact that<br/>7/6 and 8/7 are represented by the same interval is a little confusing<br/>for people, not to mention that a subm7 triad in 19-equal doesn&apos;t<br/>really sound too much like a JI subm7 triad. The concept then goes out<br/>the window though because 31-tet&apos;s extremely handy and useful<br/>note-naming system really only applies to 31-tet. 53-tet has it so<br/>that the sharps are higher than the flats, and none of it makes any<br/>sense in terms of 72-tet at all.</p><p>&gt; Experience is what we need. Experience of making music and<br/>&gt; experience of passing the knowledge to other musicians.</p><p>Amen.</p><p>&gt; I agree that meantone (of which 31tet is almost optimal)<br/>&gt; doesn&apos;t work for 9th chords. That&apos;s why I draw a<br/>&gt; distinction between 7-limit and 9-limit temperaments.<br/>&gt; Meantone is, to me, a 7-limit temperament. Magic (22&amp;19) is<br/>&gt; the simplest 9-limit temperament. So for mainstream jazz<br/>&gt; harmony the next step is magic. I&apos;ve got 19 notes tuned up<br/>&gt; now, and they work well enough. It means chords sound<br/>&gt; familiar but smoother than in 12tet. For mainstream harmony<br/>&gt; the problem is that you can&apos;t chain many fifths before you<br/>&gt; run off the edge. For me the problem is that I miss those<br/>&gt; spicy 11-limit intervals. There are some approximate 11:8s<br/>&gt; though and one neutral third!</p><p>Alright, I&apos;ve got to look into magic more deeply. When you talk about<br/>22 and 19, are you saying 22 and 19 equal? Or just a linear<br/>temperament of 22 and 19 notes?</p><p>Also, do you have any recordings of this stuff? What tools do you use<br/>to play around with all of this? This is fascinating.</p><p>&gt; If you want more fifths the solution seems to be<br/>&gt; schismatic/garibaldi (12&amp;29). 29 notes work well enough and<br/>&gt; fit a halberstadt layout although it&apos;s a stretch. It is<br/>&gt; more complex than magic. Maybe the familiarity of a fifth<br/>&gt; generator will make up for that. It&apos;s the great neverwozzer<br/>&gt; of temperament classes -- implied in theories of different<br/>&gt; cultures but never properly taken up.</p><p>Yeah. Schismatic temperament interests me quite a bit. The left<br/>hemisphere of my brain might love 72-tet, but the right hemisphere is<br/>obsessed with 53-tet. Somehow neither of them really likes 41-equal<br/>all that much though. I don&apos;t know why. It just never sounded all that<br/>good to me. Maybe the flat major third is what does it. 53-equal<br/>amazes me in that it even exists though.</p><p>&gt; For more exotic intervals or more accuracy the answer is<br/>&gt; miracle. It looked like the holy grail of 11-limit harmony<br/>&gt; when it was re-discovered in 2001 and I don&apos;t think any<br/>&gt; recent developments have changed that.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; You may also have a look at orwell (22&amp;31). It doesn&apos;t have<br/>&gt; a unique selling point in the 9-limit but it&apos;s similar to<br/>&gt; the other ones I mentioned and simpler than miracle in the<br/>&gt; 11-limit.</p><p>Ah yeah, orwell. That and semisixth I hear I need to probe more deeply into.</p><p>What software do you use to get into all of this? I&apos;ve been using<br/>Scala but it seems incapable of being used for actual composition,<br/>unless maybe I just don&apos;t know how to use it.</p><p>&gt; We don&apos;t all live in a western culture :-P</p><p>...What? Non...western...culture? Dunno what you&apos;re talking about here</p><p>&gt; My rather hubristic opinion is that although I&apos;m not even a<br/>&gt; competent musician I do have a great theory. And that<br/>&gt; theory&apos;s good enough to lead me to some worthwhile music if<br/>&gt; nobody gets there first. It&apos;s naturally difficult to<br/>&gt; interest musicians without musical examples.</p><p>Yeah, I&apos;ve been reading your &quot;regular mapping paradigm&quot; as I&apos;ve been<br/>writing this post...

These concepts already factor into Gestalt<br/>psychology anyway. It isn&apos;t that hard - assuming that you&apos;re writing<br/>music for a certain audience, you would first have in mind the mood of<br/>the audience as they sat down. You would then use that to your<br/>advantage in composing the opening movement of your piece. It would be<br/>something to shift the mood and of your audience so that no matter<br/>what mood they&apos;re in, they get dragged along with you so they are on<br/>the same page as you. The way they view the &quot;gestalt&quot; of your<br/>performance would change on your terms. You would then, knowing what<br/>mood they are in, then work their emotions perhaps more subtly in<br/>different ways and eventually lead them where you want.</p><p>You may have noticed I have basically just written out the workings of<br/>a good composer. Good composers do this all of the time. They might<br/>even take it a step further and have an overture in there as the<br/>audience comes in to even further entice the audience, and then the<br/>opening movement usually is something that easily gets the audience&apos;s<br/>interest.</p><p>Good composers know this intuitively. They already have their own<br/>theory. I merely suggest we formalize it and replace the old, coarse<br/>one.</p><p>That way we don&apos;t have the extremely coarse common practice system<br/>where doubling the third supposedly just &quot;sounds bad.&quot; It sounded bad<br/>back then, perhaps, but we&apos;re more than used to it nowadays. There are<br/>plenty of times when doubling the thirds sounds really good imo. If<br/>this theory could be generalized to include the gestalt of the<br/>listener, then we would see that given the tuning system and mindset<br/>of the average listener during the common practice period, doubling<br/>the third WOULD sound like a weird version of something they were<br/>already used to, and nowadays it stands out as an entity in its own<br/>right.</p><p>If you think about it, common practice theory is already partially<br/>tied in with psychology because of its attempts to label certain<br/>things as sounding &quot;good&quot; or &quot;bad.&quot; We&apos;re already into it. And if<br/>we&apos;re going to go into it at all, then we&apos;ll have to take the concept<br/>a step further, as imo it&apos;s currently pretty sketchy at places. The<br/>other option is to avoid it and make no attempt in any music theory to<br/>predict how things will sound.</p><p>Alternatively, a third option would be to leave it the way it is as a<br/>weird oddity so that those interested will eventually give up on it<br/>and do some research into how music REALLY works and end up at this<br/>group like I did. :P But I think there&apos;s a better way.</p><p>A good music theory will simply be a formalized system to represent<br/>the thinking of a good, intuitive musician.</p><p>&gt; Another thing that&apos;s usually not formalized are priming<br/>&gt; effects -- otherwise known as musical context. These effects<br/>&gt; again will vary by listener and by trial. In adaptive tuning<br/>&gt; schemes, one can treat past notes just like simultaneous<br/>&gt; notes but subject to a decay process that weakens the<br/>&gt; interactions. IIRC John deLaubenfels&apos; system did something<br/>&gt; like that, and other adaptive tuning schemes probably do<br/>&gt; too (my own pet adaptive tuning scheme makes use of it).</p><p>Ah, wow. An extension of the concept that if you leave out the 3rd in<br/>a chord, your mind will &quot;fill it in&quot; based on what third was heard<br/>before...? Perhaps even in a different chord? Like if I play C and G,<br/>but a little while ago there was an Eb major chord, I&apos;ll likely hear<br/>that dyad as having a &quot;minor&quot; quality.</p><p>&gt; Finally, at the level of cognitive psychology and<br/>&gt; psychoacoustics (a branch of cog psy actually), effects are<br/>&gt; largely listener-invariant. So I think it&apos;s a good place<br/>&gt; to start.</p><p>Yeah. That&apos;s where things like beat frequencies and such come into it.<br/>Perhaps it&apos;s split up this way:</p><p>Psychoacoustics is a good way to look at beat frequencies,<br/>sum-and-difference tones, phantom fundamental tones, etc... And then<br/>where gestalt psychology enters into it is how one reacts to the beat<br/>frequencies and such.</p><p>I think my main point about psychology is that even as gestalt<br/>psychology predicts certain things about how someone will perceive a<br/>chord or phrase, there will be those whose gestalts differ. Different<br/>expectations yield different gestalts. And different expectations<br/>usually stem from different cultures. So ethnomusicology should be<br/>brought into the fold as well.</p><p>I envision a theory that gives a decent prediction of how a piece in<br/>some tuning system will sound to someone used to some other tuning<br/>system. It will be able to predict that on the first listen, for<br/>Americans, the second chord in AKJ&apos;s &quot;The Juggler&quot; it will sound<br/>weird, but after repeated listens, it starts to become natural. It<br/>might even go further and predict that it sounds weird for some people<br/>and &quot;interesting&quot; for others, and why that would be.</p><p>It might also predict ways to get people into the fold of hearing<br/>something new without it sounding like a messed up version of<br/>something old. Again, most people have theories of their own floating<br/>around in their heads anyway, so they might as well be formalized and<br/>made consistent.</p><p>&gt; Assuming that people do complain about this and that it is<br/>&gt; because of the smaller whole step, what you have is a<br/>&gt; tendency to hear *melodic* intervals in terms of other melodic<br/>&gt; intervals. This is very different from the whole<br/>&gt; 16:19 v. 6:5 thing. The theory of harmonic approximation is<br/>&gt; on solid footing at this point. Our understanding of a similar<br/>&gt; concept for melodic intervals is more formative.</p><p>Ah yeah, that&apos;s interesting. Harmony is different. You are right. Why<br/>the schism in harmony and melody here, I wonder...</p><p>&gt; However, a guy named David Rothenberg has published papers<br/>&gt; about it. The basic idea is that the human memory can&apos;t cope<br/>&gt; with all the pitches in a melody directly, but it can accurately<br/>&gt; measure the size of melodic intervals as they come in and deduce<br/>&gt; the scale that way. It hears Adown Bup Aup and it knows the<br/>&gt; last note should be B above the first. The catch is, this is<br/>&gt; a skill like riding a bike. Takes a while to learn but you<br/>&gt; never forget. But you have to do it for every different scale.<br/>&gt; Say the diminished scale is a recumbent and Paul Erlich&apos;s<br/>&gt; pajara scales are like unicycles. The first time you get on a<br/>&gt; unicycle you might try to ride it like a regular bike, but<br/>&gt; you&apos;ll fall on your ass. You may then complain about unicycles.<br/>&gt; But if you practice until you can do it you then may praise<br/>&gt; unicycles.</p><p>Interesting. So that makes quite a bit of sense. And then the lazy<br/>musicians who don&apos;t want to do work never get the point block<br/>themselves off from perfecting this skill except for the scales that<br/>they already know.</p><p>&gt; Rothenberg&apos;s model actually makes predictions. For example,<br/>&gt; as you morph one scale to another (by sliding the pitches<br/>&gt; around), it predicts when you&apos;ll start to call it some tuning<br/>&gt; of the new scale instead of some tuning of the old. These<br/>&gt; predictions can be tested experimentally, but so far haven&apos;t<br/>&gt; been (to my knowledge).</p><p>Do you have a link to his model? This is really interesting. Does this<br/>apply to harmony as well?</p><p>It seems interrelated to the fact that if I play a minor triad, and<br/>then a neutral triad, the neutral triad takes on a slightly major<br/>quality. But, if I play a major triad and then a neutral triad, the<br/>neutral triad takes on a slightly minor quality.</p><p>&gt; You gave cases where it doesn&apos;t. It&apos;s so incredibly easy<br/>&gt; to make up music rules that hold sometimes and not others<br/>&gt; that they&apos;re usually not worth thinking about.</p><p>Yeah. And they are being taught in schools.</p><p>But I&apos;m more trying to figure out why when that rule DOES hold, it<br/>works. Is there some physical basis for that rule, or is it describing<br/>a cultural expectation that alters our gestalt of the chord?</p><p>&gt;&gt; If you play C E G Bb D F that F will sound<br/>&gt;&gt; pretty &quot;weak&quot; in a straight ahead jazz context,<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; C E G Bb D is a nice 4:5:6:7:9 chord in 12. The F is<br/>&gt; pretty far from the 21 that might sound nice in the chord.</p><p>Yeah, but the 21 is closer to the F than the 7 is to the Bb. There has<br/>to be another explanation...</p><p>&gt; Sure, you can use any perception -- positive or negative --<br/>&gt; to create a good musical effect. That doesn&apos;t invalidate<br/>&gt; the perception though.</p><p>I mean that the C E G Bb D F gives a negative perception in some<br/>contexts and a positive one in others. Sometimes it sounds &quot;floaty.&quot;<br/>And sometimes it sounds &quot;unstable&quot;. See? Half full, half empty.<br/>Gestalt. Furthermore, if you&apos;re a musician who knows this extremely<br/>rough &quot;no b9&quot; rule, and you hear that chord, your impression of the<br/>chord might be &quot;bad musician.&quot; I think that a decent music theory<br/>would somehow incorporate all of this. Maybe it would leave out<br/>people&apos;s personal biases so that it describes a mental space that is<br/>completely free of biases -- one that any human being could<br/>hypothetically get to. So it would be more universal.</p><p>&gt; I will say that one reason I don&apos;t like the rule is that<br/>&gt; it talks about one interval alone without considering the<br/>&gt; rest of the intervals in the chord. When evaluating chords,<br/>&gt; generally there are two things I consider: 1. how strong is<br/>&gt; the harmonic series interp (e.g. 4:5:7:9) and 2. how many<br/>&gt; of the dyads within the chord are consonant. Both of these<br/>&gt; necessitate looking at the *whole chord*, not just which<br/>&gt; root some interval is built on top of.</p><p>I think that&apos;s what my teacher is doing. He checks every dyad of the<br/>chord, and he has determined a 12tet &quot;b9&quot; dyad to be dissonant unless<br/>it&apos;s over the root. So the question can be reformulated as thus: what<br/>makes a dyad consonant or dissonant?</p><p>&gt; You and me both. We could buy a bunch of AXiSes and refretted<br/>&gt; guitars and pitch a workshop to Berklee. I&apos;d bet they&apos;d go<br/>&gt; for it. Might even give us some money.</p><p>Hey, why not :P You buy the AXiSes, I&apos;ll write Berklee...</p><p>&gt; Petr&apos;s music is generally improvisational in nature.</p><p>Ah, neat. I&apos;ll have to check that out.</p><p>&gt; The very term &quot;b9&quot; is completely tied to the diatonic scale if<br/>&gt; not to the 12-ET kernel as well and if you&apos;re using it in your<br/>&gt; line of questioning you haven&apos;t stepped outside 12 in the way<br/>&gt; I&apos;m suggesting here.</p><p>I have. I was just reiterating how it is being taught in schools. I<br/>still don&apos;t know the answer to why a 12tet b9 sometimes sounds bad<br/>over a non-rootnote in a chord. I&apos;m not sure what the corresponding JI<br/>question is, as I don&apos;t know what the corresponding JI interval to a<br/>12-tet &quot;b9&quot; is in this particular context. There are a lot around that<br/>area. I&apos;m trying to figure it out though.</p><p>&gt; The AXiS is competitively priced with halberstadt MIDI keyboards.<br/>&gt; I looked at several by Kawai and Yamaha that were as expensive<br/>&gt; just the other day. They were also total junk FWIW.</p><p>Yeah, it&apos;s $1700. It&apos;s almost twice as expensive as a Fender Rhodes<br/>and 2 and slightly less expensive than an Access TI Polar, both of<br/>which are far more than just MIDI controllers. All of this and you<br/>still have to connect it to a computer and set up your some tuning<br/>software and deal with that if you ever want to play it live. Never<br/>mind the fact that if you want decent samples to play it through, such<br/>as if you want to run it through Native Instrument&apos;s Elektric Piano or<br/>something, you&apos;re going to have to go through hell to get that<br/>running, and possibly have to deal with latency issues. So it isn&apos;t<br/>exactly the &quot;all-in-one&quot; package I&apos;d hope for to turn someone onto<br/>microtonality :P But I&apos;m sure that&apos;s in the works somewhere.</p><p>&gt; Fokker and the Dutch 31-toners did a bit of this, and some<br/>&gt; of the effects of 7-limit harmony on voice leading are<br/>&gt; understood by barbershop arrangers.</p><p>And choirs. I heard these Sibelius choral works being sung by a group<br/>called &quot;Jubilate&quot; choir - they use 7:4 all the time. Sounds perfectly<br/>natural and yet, exotic.</p><p>&gt; But if you&apos;re looking for a detailed approach to extended JI and the diatonic<br/>&gt; scale, I&apos;d say the the door is fairly open. Have at it and<br/>&gt; post your results here as you go! Oh, you might want to<br/>&gt; search in the 1/1 archives if that&apos;s possible (journal of<br/>&gt; the JI Network).</p><p>Haha, will do. Just talking about it on this group is certainly<br/>expanding my mind about the whole thing. I definitely like the<br/>Sims-Maneri notation for 72-tet as a starting point, although that<br/>still takes into account the pythagorean comma, so it does break down<br/>eventually and in certain cases. Sagittal notation is pretty decent<br/>too, but I still find Sims-Maneri to be clearer and much more easy to<br/>adjust to.</p><p>&gt; But again, I didn&apos;t say extending common practice theory,<br/>&gt; I said generalizing it. Probably best to have a look at<br/>&gt; the papers you&apos;ve been referred to at this point if you&apos;re<br/>&gt; interested in that route.</p><p>Yeah, I&apos;ve lost my life to the regular mapping paradigm at this point.</p><p>&gt;&gt; I think that rather than add random corollaries to common<br/>&gt;&gt; practice theory about what sounds good or bad, we should take<br/>&gt;&gt; the concept up to a higher level of abstraction and figure<br/>&gt;&gt; out WHY things sound good or bad<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Well you&apos;ve come to the right place then!</p><p>Yeah man! I think we just need to formalize all of these ideas. We<br/>already have ideas about why things sound the way they do, what things<br/>will sound like in this or that culture, what it&apos;ll sound like to<br/>someone in this or that mood... And I think everyone knows somewhere<br/>where traditional &quot;music theory,&quot; whether jazz theory or common<br/>practice theory breaks down or is inconsistent with reality. So if we<br/>had a formal axiomatic theory to represent the new ideas we&apos;ve got<br/>floating around, and made sure the axioms were consistent, we&apos;d be one<br/>huge step ahead of where music theory is now. I think that it would be<br/>a huge, huge help for music education in America.</p><p>Hell, maybe one of the axioms would be that the theory is incomplete,<br/>a la Godel... Unnecessary, sure, but would certainly serve to remind<br/>people to keep developing, exploring, and thinking, and not fall into<br/>the same traps that they do with the current system.</p><p>-Mike</p></div><h3>Mike Battaglia &#x3C;battaglia01@...&#x3E;</h3><span>6/8/2008 3:36:57 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Yeah, I wish all of this stuff was on Napster.

A<br/>&gt;&gt; lot of us are looking for scales with more and more accurate<br/>&gt;&gt; consonances. Naturally they end up more complex than<br/>&gt;&gt; 12-equal or meantone diatonics. As musicians in general<br/>&gt;&gt; have no problems with the scales they know they&apos;ll quite<br/>&gt;&gt; rightly ask why they should worry about anything more<br/>&gt;&gt; complicated.</p><p>Mike:<br/>&gt; Ah, yeah. Those people might screw around with it if we yelled &quot;HEADS<br/>&gt; UP&quot; and forcefully threw a 17- or 19-tone guitar directly at them.<br/>&gt; They are also the people least likely to like the way it sounds, as if<br/>&gt; these people are already burned into 12-equal, then they&apos;re unlikely<br/>&gt; to like the sound of much else short of 36-equal or 72-equal or<br/>&gt; something. And those are considerably more difficult to get into.</p><p>Even so far as I&apos;m a musician I wear different hats.  I own a few diatonic instruments and there&apos;s plenty of great diatonic music to play on them.  I shun chromatic mouth organs as too complicated.  I also have a standard guitar I use to do songs in my English lessons.  12-equal&apos;s great for that because it has all the notes you need to accompany pop songs and nothing superfluous.</p><p>&gt; Definitely. There is also an interesting shade of musician that can<br/>&gt; deal with the added complexity provided it is explained to them in a<br/>&gt; certain way that they don&apos;t have mental defenses against. For me, math<br/>&gt; and scientific-sounding theories were never a problem, so I find<br/>&gt; what&apos;s going on here to be fascinating. But if I talk about the<br/>&gt; overtones and 7-limit music and god forbid I even HINT at something<br/>&gt; like &quot;72 notes per octave,&quot; a lot of my friends&apos; minds shut down. And<br/>&gt; I&apos;m talking about people who are obviously good at math enough to play<br/>&gt; extremely complicated jazz patterns in 16th notes at quarter note =<br/>&gt; 300, but it&apos;s just that they don&apos;t want to have to think about music<br/>&gt; in the way that we often describe it here.</p><p>Mental defences can be a real problem.  I think of it as the psychological immune system.  If it encounters a foreign idea the first action is to repulse it.  Over time, if the idea proves to be benign, the reaction fades.  I know it&apos;s something I&apos;m guilty of -- I often argue against things on a knee jerk and then change my mind after mulling it over for a few hours.</p><p>&gt; Some people jump right into that kind of thinking, and some don&apos;t. But<br/>&gt; if I gave these people a 31-tone instrument and let them play on it, I<br/>&gt; bet they&apos;d come up with extremely interesting sounds and chords that<br/>&gt; maybe we wouldn&apos;t have even thought of. Maybe they&apos;d start playing C<br/>&gt; Eb G Bb and then see what the difference between that and C D# G A#<br/>&gt; is, and &quot;discover&quot; 7-limit music for themselves. Hell, maybe they<br/>&gt; wouldn&apos;t even ever know it has anything to do with the 7th overtone,<br/>&gt; just like many current musicians don&apos;t know that major chords have<br/>&gt; anything to do with the 3rd and fifth overtones.</p><p>For those kind of musicians, yes, try that!  Others will be overwhelmed with the complexity.</p><p>&gt;&gt; A blackjack guitar, tuned to 72tet, is perfectly viable. I<br/>&gt;&gt; don&apos;t remember if anybody has one yet. Guitars are all we<br/>&gt;&gt; need for rock music. Most orchestral instruments are<br/>&gt;&gt; already very flexible with regards to pitch and quartertone<br/>&gt;&gt; instruments all the better for reaching arbitrary intervals.<br/>&gt; &gt; Interesting. My beef with non-equal temperaments being used as a<br/>&gt; widespread system is just that you can&apos;t write in any key. Maybe it&apos;s<br/>&gt; just my bias - I hear different keys as having different colors, and<br/>&gt; if every song to come out were in only two or three keys because of a<br/>&gt; non-equal system, I&apos;d be really sad. It&apos;s like the only colors you see<br/>&gt; for the rest of your life are red. Or, like if any time you saw blue<br/>&gt; from then on, it was really dirty blue because blue suddenly has<br/>&gt; terrible wolf fifths that threaten the harmonic stability of your<br/>&gt; state of mind and the entire world. I may be ranting again.</p><p>Are you the one with perfect pitch then?  A guitar&apos;s already like that for me because I can only play in 2 or 3 keys :-P   And it does get harder the more frets you add.  But, still, 31&apos;s about doable (some have done it) so you could fret to canasta and have 10 different keys of blackjack.</p><p>&gt; Plus, it would be quite difficult to compose Debussy-ish pieces that<br/>&gt; use interesting modulations and such. Jazz as well has a history of<br/>&gt; composers and songwriters trying to come out with more and more<br/>&gt; interesting chord progressions, so that would be limiting there as<br/>&gt; well. I&apos;m sure I&apos;m gonna get hammered for clinging to my equal<br/>&gt; temperaments on a forum about tuning, but I&apos;ve always had that feeling<br/>&gt; about it.</p><p>Miracle temperament naturally supports modulations by seconds because they&apos;re the simplest intervals.  The 10 note scale is almost equal.  If you can&apos;t do an exact modulation it&apos;s often a question of trading one consonance for another. There are still more notes than 12-equal and different places to start so you have more opportunity for interesting progressions.</p><p>Mystery temperament deserves a mention here.  It has two scales of 29-equal about 16 cents apart.  Not that simple, but once you tune it up you can modulate freely to 29 different degrees.  And it&apos;s very good for 15-limit harmony.   One way to realize it would be with a guitar fretted to 29-equal.</p><p>&gt;&gt; I have a pipe dream of a miracle ensemble. Each instrument<br/>&gt;&gt; plays a different subset of canasta (miracle31) or 72tet if<br/>&gt;&gt; you like. Some will play &quot;pygmy&quot; pentatonics, with chains<br/>&gt;&gt; of approximate 8:7s.<br/>&gt; &gt; Interesting description. Would 5-equal satisfy what you would call a<br/>&gt; &quot;pygmy&quot; pentatonic in one particular key?</p><p>The true Pygmy scale (from the Scala archive) is in just intonation.  It can be approximated in miracle, in which case it&apos;s an MOS of Margo Schulter&apos;s wonder temperament -- every other note of miracle and no 5s.  In that case, yes, 5-equal is a tuning.</p><p>There&apos;s another interesting scale you get by tuning the other way from 5-equal.  The generator is a compromise between 7:6 and 8:7 so two of them give a 4:3.  It works with 19-, 24-, and 29-equal.  Not a great approximation but in so far as it works every interval is in the 9-limit. (Also a property of the traditional meantone pentatonic.)</p><p>I used both scales with custom timbres in my MMM Day submission, which I think is on my website now.</p><p>&gt;&gt; Six of those can handle 30 notes<br/>&gt;&gt; between them. Some instruments will play mohajira (7 notes<br/>&gt;&gt; generated by neutral thirds). Three such cover the 21 notes<br/>&gt;&gt; of blackjack. Some instruments will handle the full decimal<br/>&gt;&gt; scale, and four such give canasta with a bit of overlap.<br/>&gt;&gt; Maybe some of the instruments will be able to handle the<br/>&gt;&gt; full 31 note gamut. But the idea is to share the notes<br/>&gt;&gt; around so that each instrument and each instrumental part is<br/>&gt;&gt; relatively simple.<br/>&gt; &gt; That&apos;s a really interesting idea - I&apos;d be very interested in hearing<br/>&gt; what that would sound like.<br/>&gt; &gt; I think it would be worthwhile to put some of these ideas through<br/>&gt; Vienna Symphonic Library or EastWest or some &quot;hyper-realistic&quot;<br/>&gt; orchestral sample program to hear what this stuff would sound like.<br/>&gt; EWQL Ra would undoubtedly be a good idea as well.</p><p>It&apos;s a bit eccentric to design a virtual orchestra around the limitations of acoustic insruments but perhaps I will one day.  I don&apos;t have any of these samples...  The pentatatonic instruments would logically be gu zhengs, which aren&apos;t symphonic.  Maybe bamboo flutes for the mohajiras.</p><p>&gt;&gt; The &quot;too many notes&quot; argument is why I use linear<br/>&gt;&gt; temperaments. Miracle works fine with 21 notes. You only<br/>&gt;&gt; need to teach those 21 notes. Sure, it&apos;s more complicated<br/>&gt;&gt; than 12 notes, but the more adventurous musicians can handle<br/>&gt;&gt; it. It has some really cool intervals. You can teach it<br/>&gt;&gt; much the way you do any other super-scale -- nice chords,<br/>&gt;&gt; nasty chords, scales, melodies. There are more consonances<br/>&gt;&gt; to remember but that&apos;s the whole point.<br/>&gt; &gt; That&apos;s a really interesting idea. To teach someone with blackjack and<br/>&gt; then have them jump up to canasta and then the 41-note one (I forget<br/>&gt; the name now) and then up to 72-equal. That might be a really good way<br/>&gt; to teach this stuff.</p><p>There&apos;s no particular need to go beyond canasta.  But if you do the next one&apos;s called stud loco.</p><p>&gt;&gt; Magic works with only 19 notes and you can do a fair bit<br/>&gt;&gt; with 16. That means it isn&apos;t significantly more complex<br/>&gt;&gt; than meantone in the 7-limit. It doesn&apos;t naturally break<br/>&gt;&gt; down into simpler scales but I&apos;ve cracked the notation<br/>&gt;&gt; problem now. It naturally supports chords built by chaining<br/>&gt;&gt; thirds. There are more of them than in 12tet and more ways<br/>&gt;&gt; of connecting them but not so difficult compared to the<br/>&gt;&gt; outer reaches of jazz harmony.<br/>&gt; &gt; I&apos;ll have to check magic out again. 19-tet is magic, isn&apos;t it? Maybe<br/>&gt; 19-tet is too limiting for the full range of what magic can do. Or is<br/>&gt; magic just the linear temperament generated by dividing 3/1 into 5<br/>&gt; equal parts?</p><p>Magic can be 19 notes.  The optimal tuning is very close to 41-tet, which you say you don&apos;t like :-O  But you can make it more 19-like if you want.  Yes, it divides the 3/1 into 5 parts, each of which approximates a 5:4.</p><p>&gt;&gt; In both cases you can tie chords to the harmonic series if<br/>&gt;&gt; you want to. If your students object to that you can talk<br/>&gt;&gt; about different thirds: subminor-minor-neutral-major-supermajor.<br/>&gt; &gt; Yeah. I find 31-equal to be a great introduction to the whole thing,<br/>&gt; honestly. 19-equal is a decent introduction as well, but the fact that<br/>&gt; 7/6 and 8/7 are represented by the same interval is a little confusing<br/>&gt; for people, not to mention that a subm7 triad in 19-equal doesn&apos;t<br/>&gt; really sound too much like a JI subm7 triad. The concept then goes out<br/>&gt; the window though because 31-tet&apos;s extremely handy and useful<br/>&gt; note-naming system really only applies to 31-tet. 53-tet has it so<br/>&gt; that the sharps are higher than the flats, and none of it makes any<br/>&gt; sense in terms of 72-tet at all.</p><p>The thirds are only equally spaced in 31-equal.  But throw away the neutral third and the ones you have left are equally spaced in magic temperament.  You may not want to call them &quot;thirds&quot; then.  Whatever you call them you can talk about them in any regular temperament.</p><p>&gt;&gt; I agree that meantone (of which 31tet is almost optimal)<br/>&gt;&gt; doesn&apos;t work for 9th chords. That&apos;s why I draw a<br/>&gt;&gt; distinction between 7-limit and 9-limit temperaments.<br/>&gt;&gt; Meantone is, to me, a 7-limit temperament. Magic (22&amp;19) is<br/>&gt;&gt; the simplest 9-limit temperament. So for mainstream jazz<br/>&gt;&gt; harmony the next step is magic. I&apos;ve got 19 notes tuned up<br/>&gt;&gt; now, and they work well enough. It means chords sound<br/>&gt;&gt; familiar but smoother than in 12tet. For mainstream harmony<br/>&gt;&gt; the problem is that you can&apos;t chain many fifths before you<br/>&gt;&gt; run off the edge. For me the problem is that I miss those<br/>&gt;&gt; spicy 11-limit intervals. There are some approximate 11:8s<br/>&gt;&gt; though and one neutral third!<br/>&gt; &gt; Alright, I&apos;ve got to look into magic more deeply. When you talk about<br/>&gt; 22 and 19, are you saying 22 and 19 equal? Or just a linear<br/>&gt; temperament of 22 and 19 notes?</p><p>A linear temperament with MOS scales of 19 or 22 notes.</p><p>&gt; Also, do you have any recordings of this stuff? What tools do you use<br/>&gt; to play around with all of this? This is fascinating.</p><p>My original magic demonstration is on my website:</p><p><a href="http://x31eq.com/music/">http://x31eq.com/music/</a></p><p>It&apos;s both partly improvised and entirely computer generated!</p><p>I also have a cover version of the Fleetwood Mac song the name &quot;magic&quot; comes from that involves both magic and miracle temperaments.  But it isn&apos;t on the website because of its obvious unoriginality.</p><p>These days I have a Miditech Midistart-2 input keyboard plugged into Csound.  With, so far, some very boring timbres in magic because the clever ones are all designed for decimal tunings.</p><p>&gt; What software do you use to get into all of this? I&apos;ve been using<br/>&gt; Scala but it seems incapable of being used for actual composition,<br/>&gt; unless maybe I just don&apos;t know how to use it.</p><p>Csound these days.  I used Kyma before but I can&apos;t carry the hardware around with me.</p><p>&gt;&gt; We don&apos;t all live in a western culture :-P<br/>&gt; &gt; ...What? Non...western...culture? Dunno what you&apos;re talking about here</p><p>I live in a city with so few westerners that people stare at   me as I walk past.</p><p>As it happens there was a programme on the television tonight celebrating Chinese culture.  And the triumphalist ending was -- set to music entirely based on western harmony.  Which confirms somebody&apos;s point: harmony is a very successful European export.  Folk tunes around the world are being set to a soupy 5-limit backing and losing the original intonation.  One thing I hope to get across with the regular mapping paradigm is that there are other ways to do harmony.   Some of them may suit other cultures even if the principles follow from European considerations.</p><p>                  Graham</p></div><h3>Carl Lumma &#x3C;carl@...&#x3E;</h3><span>6/8/2008 11:17:43 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Mike wrote:</p><p>&gt; &gt; Human psychology varies greatly by individual and by trial<br/>&gt; &gt; (what kind of day you&apos;re having), so it&apos;s difficult to<br/>&gt; &gt; formalize anything about it in a music theory.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Difficult but necessary.</p><p>Nah.</p><p>&gt; assuming that you&apos;re writing music for a certain audience,<br/>&gt; you would first have in mind the mood of the audience as<br/>&gt; they sat down.</p><p>That&apos;s what DJing is all about.  But see:<br/><a href="http://lumma.org/microwave/#2005.09.21">http://lumma.org/microwave/#2005.09.21</a></p><p>A related idea also features prominently in Indian classical<br/>music, but from a more religious angle.</p><p>&gt; Good composers do this all of the time.</p><p>Yes.  It&apos;s nothing specific to microtonality that I can see.</p><p>&gt; If you think about it, common practice theory is already partially<br/>&gt; tied in with psychology because of its attempts to label certain<br/>&gt; things as sounding &quot;good&quot; or &quot;bad.&quot; We&apos;re already into it.</p><p>Nah.  You can derive most of the common-practice rules<br/>from psychoacoustics.</p><p>&gt; &gt; Another thing that&apos;s usually not formalized are priming<br/>&gt; &gt; effects -- otherwise known as musical context. These effects<br/>&gt; &gt; again will vary by listener and by trial. In adaptive tuning<br/>&gt; &gt; schemes, one can treat past notes just like simultaneous<br/>&gt; &gt; notes but subject to a decay process that weakens the<br/>&gt; &gt; interactions. IIRC John deLaubenfels&apos; system did something<br/>&gt; &gt; like that, and other adaptive tuning schemes probably do<br/>&gt; &gt; too (my own pet adaptive tuning scheme makes use of it).<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Ah, wow. An extension of the concept that if you leave out<br/>&gt; the 3rd in a chord, your mind will &quot;fill it in&quot; based on what<br/>&gt; third was heard before...?</p><p>No.  That&apos;s to do with simultaneities.</p><p>&gt; Perhaps even in a different chord? Like if I play C and G,<br/>&gt; but a little while ago there was an Eb major chord, I&apos;ll likely<br/>&gt; hear that dyad as having a &quot;minor&quot; quality.</p><p>More like it, yes.</p><p>&gt; &gt; Finally, at the level of cognitive psychology and<br/>&gt; &gt; psychoacoustics (a branch of cog psy actually), effects are<br/>&gt; &gt; largely listener-invariant. So I think it&apos;s a good place<br/>&gt; &gt; to start.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Yeah. That&apos;s where things like beat frequencies and such come<br/>&gt; into it.</p><p>It&apos;s much more than beat frequencies.</p><p>&gt; I think my main point about psychology is that even as gestalt<br/>&gt; psychology predicts certain things about how someone will<br/>&gt; perceive a chord or phrase, there will be those whose gestalts<br/>&gt; differ. Different expectations yield different gestalts. And<br/>&gt; different expectations usually stem from different cultures.</p><p>If you know a way to get falsifiable predictions out of<br/>gestalt psychology you should submit to Nature now.</p><p>&gt; So ethnomusicology should be brought into the fold as well.</p><p>You could say that the regular mapping paradigm is the<br/>resulting of turning ethnomusicology on Western music.</p><p>&gt; &gt; Assuming that people do complain about this and that it is<br/>&gt; &gt; because of the smaller whole step, what you have is a<br/>&gt; &gt; tendency to hear *melodic* intervals in terms of other melodic<br/>&gt; &gt; intervals. This is very different from the whole<br/>&gt; &gt; 16:19 v. 6:5 thing. The theory of harmonic approximation is<br/>&gt; &gt; on solid footing at this point. Our understanding of a similar<br/>&gt; &gt; concept for melodic intervals is more formative.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Ah yeah, that&apos;s interesting. Harmony is different. You are<br/>&gt; right. Why the schism in harmony and melody here, I wonder...</p><p>It&apos;s because the former doesn&apos;t require memory.  Harmonies<br/>are processed directly by the virtual pitch detector in the<br/>auditory midbrain.</p><p>&gt; &gt; Rothenberg&apos;s model actually makes predictions. For example,<br/>&gt; &gt; as you morph one scale to another (by sliding the pitches<br/>&gt; &gt; around), it predicts when you&apos;ll start to call it some tuning<br/>&gt; &gt; of the new scale instead of some tuning of the old. These<br/>&gt; &gt; predictions can be tested experimentally, but so far haven&apos;t<br/>&gt; &gt; been (to my knowledge).<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Do you have a link to his model? This is really interesting.</p><p>Yes.  I should warn you it&apos;s heavy going.<br/><a href="http://lumma.org/tuning/rothenberg/AModelForPatternPerception.pdf">http://lumma.org/tuning/rothenberg/AModelForPatternPerception.pdf</a></p><p>&gt; Does this apply to harmony as well?</p><p>No.  :)</p><p>&gt; It seems interrelated to the fact that if I play a minor triad, and<br/>&gt; then a neutral triad, the neutral triad takes on a slightly major<br/>&gt; quality. But, if I play a major triad and then a neutral triad, the<br/>&gt; neutral triad takes on a slightly minor quality.</p><p>Yeah, that&apos;s related to:<br/><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anchoring_effect">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anchoring_effect</a></p><p>&gt; &gt; You gave cases where it doesn&apos;t. It&apos;s so incredibly easy<br/>&gt; &gt; to make up music rules that hold sometimes and not others<br/>&gt; &gt; that they&apos;re usually not worth thinking about.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Yeah. And they are being taught in schools.</p><p>Oh, it gets far worse that that!  Know anything about<br/>&quot;music set theory&quot;?</p><p>&gt; &gt;&gt; If you play C E G Bb D F that F will sound<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt; pretty &quot;weak&quot; in a straight ahead jazz context,<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; C E G Bb D is a nice 4:5:6:7:9 chord in 12. The F is<br/>&gt; &gt; pretty far from the 21 that might sound nice in the chord.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Yeah, but the 21 is closer to the F than the 7 is to the Bb.<br/>&gt; There has to be another explanation...</p><p>The field of attraction of 7 is effectively much broader<br/>than the field of attraction of 21, because 21 runs into<br/>the nearby very strong field of 4/3.<br/>Or it could be that you want to hear 11 there.  The point<br/>is that F doesn&apos;t fit into the harmonic series interp as<br/>well as the other notes, so it weakens the interp.  If we<br/>had hexadic harmonic entropy, you could actually calculate<br/>that the harmonic entropy goes down as you go from C E<br/>to C E G to C E G Bb to C E G Bb D and then pops up when<br/>you add the F.</p><p>&gt; &gt; Sure, you can use any perception -- positive or negative --<br/>&gt; &gt; to create a good musical effect. That doesn&apos;t invalidate<br/>&gt; &gt; the perception though.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I mean that the C E G Bb D F gives a negative perception in<br/>&gt; some contexts and a positive one in others. Sometimes it<br/>&gt; sounds &quot;floaty.&quot;  And sometimes it sounds &quot;unstable&quot;. See?<br/>&gt; Half full, half empty.</p><p>Yes.  That&apos;s musical context and its study is really out of<br/>the scope of tuning theory.  But if you want to post your<br/>findings here people will probably be receptive, especially<br/>if you use alternate tunings in your experiments.  But if<br/>you just want to ask about it here it&apos;s probably not the<br/>right venue.</p><p>&gt; &gt; I will say that one reason I don&apos;t like the rule is that<br/>&gt; &gt; it talks about one interval alone without considering the<br/>&gt; &gt; rest of the intervals in the chord. When evaluating chords,<br/>&gt; &gt; generally there are two things I consider: 1. how strong is<br/>&gt; &gt; the harmonic series interp (e.g. 4:5:7:9) and 2. how many<br/>&gt; &gt; of the dyads within the chord are consonant. Both of these<br/>&gt; &gt; necessitate looking at the *whole chord*, not just which<br/>&gt; &gt; root some interval is built on top of.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I think that&apos;s what my teacher is doing. He checks every dyad<br/>&gt; of the chord, and he has determined a 12tet &quot;b9&quot; dyad to be<br/>&gt; dissonant unless it&apos;s over the root.</p><p>No.  When you check every dyad you don&apos;t care where they are<br/>in the chord (checking the harmonic series interp takes care<br/>of that).  For intance, the dyads in C E G Bb approximate:</p><p>5/4<br/>6/5<br/>7/6<br/>3/2<br/>7/5<br/>7/4</p><p>All of those are 7-limit consonances.  So assuming the<br/>approximations are any good, the chord will be consonant.</p><p>&gt; So the question can be reformulated as thus: what<br/>&gt; makes a dyad consonant or dissonant?</p><p>There are two things: low harmonic entropy and low roughness.<br/>You can have one, the other, or both.  Consonance is actually<br/>two different perceptions.  But for harmonic timbres usually<br/>used in Western music, these two components of consonance<br/>usually move together.  When you get into adaptive synthesis<br/>like Bill Sethares, you can make timbres that are beatless<br/>in 10-ET, but at the cost of increasing harmonic entropy<br/>somewhat.  So you can begin to hear one without the other<br/>in that case.</p><p>But probably the best way to hear one without the other is<br/>by playing extended utonalities -- try a subharmonic<br/>4:5:6:7:9:11 chord.  It&apos;s should be just as beatless as the<br/>harmonic version because all its dyads are the same.  But<br/>the harmonic series interp skyrockets, which means the<br/>harmonic entropy does too.  And the chord by most accounts<br/>sounds waay less consonant.</p><p>&gt; &gt; You and me both. We could buy a bunch of AXiSes and refretted<br/>&gt; &gt; guitars and pitch a workshop to Berklee. I&apos;d bet they&apos;d go<br/>&gt; &gt; for it. Might even give us some money.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Hey, why not :P You buy the AXiSes, I&apos;ll write Berklee...</p><p>We could write a grant, or suggest to Berklee that they<br/>pay us for giving the workshop.</p><p>&gt; &gt; Petr&apos;s music is generally improvisational in nature.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Ah, neat. I&apos;ll have to check that out.</p><p>Drop him a line or make a post asking to hear his stuff.</p><p>&gt; &gt; The AXiS is competitively priced with halberstadt MIDI keyboards.<br/>&gt; &gt; I looked at several by Kawai and Yamaha that were as expensive<br/>&gt; &gt; just the other day. They were also total junk FWIW.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Yeah, it&apos;s $1700. It&apos;s almost twice as expensive as a Fender Rhodes</p><p>How you figure?  Rhodeses are total money pits.  You could buy<br/>several AXiSes for one in any kind of condition.</p><p>&gt; and 2 and slightly less expensive than an Access TI Polar,</p><p>By the way, I believe the Access TI has built-in Hermode<br/>tuning.  (<a href="http://www.hermode.com">www.hermode.com</a>)</p><p>&gt; both of  which are far more than just MIDI controllers</p><p>Yes, but the best synth in the known universe (pianoteq)<br/>only costs $200, and there are many excellent cheap or<br/>free microtonal-capable softsynths around the way.</p><p>&gt; All of this and you<br/>&gt; still have to connect it to a computer and set up your some<br/>&gt; tuning software and deal with that if you ever want to play<br/>&gt; it live.</p><p>It&apos;s a bit of a pain I admit but not one that warrants the<br/>number of complaints I hear about it.</p><p>&gt; Never mind the fact that if you want decent samples</p><p>Samples??  Blechk!</p><p>&gt; possibly have to deal with latency issues</p><p>Pianoteq runs like a champ on my 4-year-old laptop and<br/>sounds better than any other synth I&apos;ve ever played (which<br/>is a lot, since I used to review them for Keyboard magazine).<br/>You can&apos;t beat that with a stick.</p><p>&gt; I definitely like the<br/>&gt; Sims-Maneri notation for 72-tet as a starting point,</p><p>I strongly recommend decimal notation for 72.</p><p>&gt; &gt;&gt; I think that rather than add random corollaries to common<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt; practice theory about what sounds good or bad, we should take<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt; the concept up to a higher level of abstraction and figure<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt; out WHY things sound good or bad<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; Well you&apos;ve come to the right place then!<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Yeah man! I think we just need to formalize all of these ideas.</p><p>They&apos;re more formalized than I can handle already.

I would then say that Indian classical music<br/>has a stronger basis in that regard than Western classical music.</p><p>&gt;&gt; Good composers do this all of the time.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Yes. It&apos;s nothing specific to microtonality that I can see.</p><p>As far as I know, this forum isn&apos;t about topics that are completely<br/>exclusive to microtonality, but rather that apply to microtonality :)<br/>Are you saying this thread is &quot;off-topic?&quot; I&apos;m not sure what you mean<br/>here.</p><p>The entire paragraph was meant to shed light on these psychological<br/>&quot;gestalt-altering&quot; techniques and look at how they apply to music.<br/>Alternately, you can look at these musical techniques from a<br/>psychological perspective. Music and psychology are already<br/>interwoven. The entire paragraph was written to support the statement<br/>that an elucidating and understanding of these psychological tools<br/>would be useful in a &quot;music theory,&quot; rather than the current system<br/>which has &quot;rules&quot; as to what sounds good or bad and a vague notion<br/>that &quot;the rules can be broken.&quot; So basically it was meant to support<br/>the first statement in my sentence, which you so eloquently dismissed<br/>with a &quot;Nah.&quot; :)</p><p>The fact that composers already do this means that it is already part<br/>of their own internal &quot;music theory.&quot; I am simply suggesting that we<br/>work out the inconsistencies and formalize it, as common practice<br/>theory is formalized.</p><p>&gt;&gt; If you think about it, common practice theory is already partially<br/>&gt;&gt; tied in with psychology because of its attempts to label certain<br/>&gt;&gt; things as sounding &quot;good&quot; or &quot;bad.&quot; We&apos;re already into it.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Nah. You can derive most of the common-practice rules<br/>&gt; from psychoacoustics.</p><p>Yes. Many of them. The &quot;ban&quot; on parallel fifths and octaves in 4 part<br/>writing is a good example of how psychoacoustics comes into play. The<br/>omitting of the fifth being allowed does as well. Psychoacoustics<br/>doesn&apos;t often talk about what sounds &quot;good&quot; or &quot;bad&quot; because whether<br/>or not someone LIKES something has nothing to do with psychoacoustics,<br/>but rather the psychological composition of the listener. So I suggest<br/>that we either stop teaching what sounds good and bad in music schools<br/>(which partially defeats the purpose of a music school), or we dig in<br/>deeper and get further into the psychology of things rather than what<br/>sounded good to the average person in the 17th century.</p><p>//</p><p>&gt;&gt; I think my main point about psychology is that even as gestalt<br/>&gt;&gt; psychology predicts certain things about how someone will<br/>&gt;&gt; perceive a chord or phrase, there will be those whose gestalts<br/>&gt;&gt; differ. Different expectations yield different gestalts. And<br/>&gt;&gt; different expectations usually stem from different cultures.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; If you know a way to get falsifiable predictions out of<br/>&gt; gestalt psychology you should submit to Nature now.</p><p>That&apos;s sort of the line of research I&apos;m proposing with this thread.<br/>I&apos;d be happy with a prediction rate of 75-85%. The predictions don&apos;t<br/>necessarily have to be perfect. Just better than they are now. The<br/>concept of the predictions never actually reaching perfection could be<br/>a key point in the teaching of music.</p><p>&gt;&gt; So ethnomusicology should be brought into the fold as well.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; You could say that the regular mapping paradigm is the<br/>&gt; resulting of turning ethnomusicology on Western music.</p><p>Yeah, I&apos;ve been reading it for a day now. It&apos;s really, really<br/>interesting, and actually does adequately address a lot of the<br/>problems I was talking about, as well as leave areas for further<br/>research (sum and difference tones and such).</p><p>&gt;&gt; &gt; Assuming that people do complain about this and that it is<br/>&gt;&gt; &gt; because of the smaller whole step, what you have is a<br/>&gt;&gt; &gt; tendency to hear *melodic* intervals in terms of other melodic<br/>&gt;&gt; &gt; intervals. This is very different from the whole<br/>&gt;&gt; &gt; 16:19 v. 6:5 thing. The theory of harmonic approximation is<br/>&gt;&gt; &gt; on solid footing at this point. Our understanding of a similar<br/>&gt;&gt; &gt; concept for melodic intervals is more formative.<br/>&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt; Ah yeah, that&apos;s interesting. Harmony is different. You are<br/>&gt;&gt; right. Why the schism in harmony and melody here, I wonder...<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; It&apos;s because the former doesn&apos;t require memory. Harmonies<br/>&gt; are processed directly by the virtual pitch detector in the<br/>&gt; auditory midbrain.</p><p>Interesting, does Rothenberg&apos;s model address people with absolute<br/>pitch? I am blessed with the ability but I find little to no research<br/>involving it in a microtonal sense... When I hear a melody, I don&apos;t<br/>hear up/down/up, but rather A B A or something, so it isn&apos;t that I<br/>hear music in terms of just intervals. I can see what Rothenberg&apos;s<br/>talking about, but for me there is this virtual conflict -- let&apos;s say<br/>you have a melody ascending in major whole tones and then descending<br/>in minor whole tones. If the melody ends up a half step higher from<br/>where it started, for example, I will be very very confused, as I&apos;ll<br/>hear whole tones in either direction, but that will be in conflict<br/>with the fact that the end note I&apos;m hearing is much different from the<br/>start note.</p><p>I definitely do see what you&apos;re talking about about the &quot;skill&quot; of<br/>memorizing intervals though.</p><p>&gt;&gt; &gt; Rothenberg&apos;s model actually makes predictions. For example,<br/>&gt;&gt; &gt; as you morph one scale to another (by sliding the pitches<br/>&gt;&gt; &gt; around), it predicts when you&apos;ll start to call it some tuning<br/>&gt;&gt; &gt; of the new scale instead of some tuning of the old. These<br/>&gt;&gt; &gt; predictions can be tested experimentally, but so far haven&apos;t<br/>&gt;&gt; &gt; been (to my knowledge).<br/>&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt; Do you have a link to his model? This is really interesting.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Yes. I should warn you it&apos;s heavy going.<br/>&gt; <a href="http://lumma.org/tuning/rothenberg/AModelForPatternPerception.pdf">http://lumma.org/tuning/rothenberg/AModelForPatternPerception.pdf</a></p><p>Thanks, I&apos;ll check it out. 85 pages is gonna be fun to get through.<br/>//</p><p>&gt; Oh, it gets far worse that that! Know anything about<br/>&gt; &quot;music set theory&quot;?</p><p>I just gave it a look on Wikipedia. My main beef with it is that it&apos;s<br/>one step away from JI, which is what really needs to be taught in<br/>schools, IMO. Might be useful for something, I can&apos;t tell from the<br/>first glance. The concept of an &quot;interval vector&quot; I found to be<br/>laughable.</p><p>&gt; The field of attraction of 7 is effectively much broader<br/>&gt; than the field of attraction of 21, because 21 runs into<br/>&gt; the nearby very strong field of 4/3.<br/>&gt; Or it could be that you want to hear 11 there. The point<br/>&gt; is that F doesn&apos;t fit into the harmonic series interp as<br/>&gt; well as the other notes, so it weakens the interp. If we<br/>&gt; had hexadic harmonic entropy, you could actually calculate<br/>&gt; that the harmonic entropy goes down as you go from C E<br/>&gt; to C E G to C E G Bb to C E G Bb D and then pops up when<br/>&gt; you add the F.</p><p>OK, let me give you a better example - something a little further from<br/>the harmonic series. how about C Eb G Bb D F Ab? That Ab on the top to<br/>my ears sounds pretty weak structurally, and if I ever hear that chord<br/>voiced in jazz they usually put the Ab where I have the G and<br/>vice-versa. Let&apos;s assume this to be 5 limit - the 5-limit JI chord<br/>version of this displays this same property. This chord:</p><p>100:120:150:180:225:270:324</p><p>is the one I&apos;m talking about. The first 6 notes sound good, but when<br/>you add that 324, the whole chord is destabilized.</p><p>Jazz has this concept of &quot;avoid notes&quot; - over major, you&apos;re supposed<br/>to avoid playing the 4th scale degree for too long over a major chord.<br/>In Aeolian, you&apos;re supposed to avoid playing the b6 for too long. My<br/>teacher was basically trying to teach me that concept in the context<br/>of harmony.</p><p>I thought that it had something to do with mixing utonalities and<br/>otonalities in the same chord... Then I realized that a dominant 7<br/>chord with 16:9 as the 7 is 2 fourths, and that doesn&apos;t sound bad. Not<br/>to mention a good ol minor chord.</p><p>&gt; Yes. That&apos;s musical context and its study is really out of<br/>&gt; the scope of tuning theory. But if you want to post your<br/>&gt; findings here people will probably be receptive, especially<br/>&gt; if you use alternate tunings in your experiments. But if<br/>&gt; you just want to ask about it here it&apos;s probably not the<br/>&gt; right venue.</p><p>Alright, fair enough. Perhaps it would be a better question for the<br/>MMM group. I was using that as another example to how gestalt<br/>psychology ties into music theory as described in my first paragraph.<br/>It demonstrates how the &quot;gestalt&quot; of the chord changes depending on<br/>the circumstances, which is a concept that I think would have some<br/>profound implications in other areas of tuning theory.</p><p>&gt; No. When you check every dyad you don&apos;t care where they are<br/>&gt; in the chord (checking the harmonic series interp takes care<br/>&gt; of that). For intance, the dyads in C E G Bb approximate:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; 5/4<br/>&gt; 6/5<br/>&gt; 7/6<br/>&gt; 3/2<br/>&gt; 7/5<br/>&gt; 7/4<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; All of those are 7-limit consonances. So assuming the<br/>&gt; approximations are any good, the chord will be consonant.</p><p>So how does C Eb G Bb D F Ab fit into that? That chord sounds<br/>dissonant, but C F G Db does not. I suppose they both sound to some<br/>extent &quot;dissonant,&quot; and &quot;unresolved,&quot; but the first one sounds less<br/>stable, I suppose.</p><p>&gt; There are two things: low harmonic entropy and low roughness.<br/>&gt; You can have one, the other, or both. Consonance is actually<br/>&gt; two different perceptions. But for harmonic timbres usually<br/>&gt; used in Western music, these two components of consonance<br/>&gt; usually move together. When you get into adaptive synthesis<br/>&gt; like Bill Sethares, you can make timbres that are beatless<br/>&gt; in 10-ET, but at the cost of increasing harmonic entropy<br/>&gt; somewhat. So you can begin to hear one without the other<br/>&gt; in that case.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; But probably the best way to hear one without the other is<br/>&gt; by playing extended utonalities -- try a subharmonic<br/>&gt; 4:5:6:7:9:11 chord. It&apos;s should be just as beatless as the<br/>&gt; harmonic version because all its dyads are the same. But<br/>&gt; the harmonic series interp skyrockets, which means the<br/>&gt; harmonic entropy does too. And the chord by most accounts<br/>&gt; sounds waay less consonant.</p><p>Ah, wow. That&apos;s a good way of explaining it.</p><p>So then I suppose an alternate question is, C E G Bb D F sounds pretty<br/>weak, but C E G Bb D F# sounds quite strong to me. 11/4 is halfway<br/>between the F and the F#. Why does that F# work so well? Is it just<br/>that the F# is out of the way of the field of attraction of the 4/3,<br/>and so that it can jump to the 11/4 more easily?</p><p>&gt;&gt; &gt; You and me both. We could buy a bunch of AXiSes and refretted<br/>&gt;&gt; &gt; guitars and pitch a workshop to Berklee. I&apos;d bet they&apos;d go<br/>&gt;&gt; &gt; for it. Might even give us some money.<br/>&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt; Hey, why not :P You buy the AXiSes, I&apos;ll write Berklee...<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; We could write a grant, or suggest to Berklee that they<br/>&gt; pay us for giving the workshop.</p><p>I&apos;m down. I would find it to be personally fulfilling for me as the<br/>culmination of my efforts in finding the easiest microtonal system for<br/>my non-mathematical friends to adjust to. There are a -lot- of schools<br/>that I know of that would be interested in such a program, the<br/>University of Miami and USC.</p><p>It would be good to build some kind of &quot;course&quot; to facilitate the<br/>learning of this - perhaps people could start with something simple<br/>such as 19- or 17-tet. Hell, maybe even throw in 5-tet before that<br/>just to get them quickly accustomed to the fact that not everything<br/>besides 12-tet sounds &quot;weird.&quot; From there it might be nice to jump up<br/>to something like 31, so they can jump into 7-limit and 11-limit music<br/>fairly quickly. I think that might be a nice time to start addressing<br/>the theory behind it, getting into 5-limit and 7-limit JI and such.<br/>Maybe at that point let them screw around with a non-meantone<br/>temperament like 53-equal, which might be a good choice as the harmony<br/>is almost pure and nearly indistinguishable from JI, and some of the<br/>more compositional-minded students would probably enjoy the ability to<br/>modulate to any key. Alternately, we could let them screw around with<br/>the Axis&apos; harmonic table in pure 5 or 7-limit just (if we can get a<br/>decent 7-limit pattern going for it). The culmination of the whole<br/>course would be to introduce 72-equal to them, at which point all of<br/>the stuff they&apos;ve learned ties in together almost perfectly with the<br/>system they already know, and they &quot;see the light&quot; just like most<br/>people who are exposed to 72-equal for the first time :P</p><p>Another approach that Graham suggested in this same thread is to<br/>alternately start them off with some non-equal temperament like magic<br/>or blackjack to get them started with higher-limit chords right away,<br/>for those who complain about &quot;too many notes per octave.&quot; It&apos;s an<br/>interesting idea to be sure, although I personally have never found<br/>higher-order equal temperaments to be that intimidating as long as<br/>some regular pattern can be seen amongst the notes. 31-tet&apos;s note<br/>naming system, for example, stems directly from the usual meantone<br/>tradition, and I found it extremely easy to grasp right away. Stuff<br/>like 53-equal is a little harder at first, but I think once people<br/>realize that 31 isn&apos;t the end of the world, they&apos;re much more likely<br/>to jump into that. And 72-equal is pretty easy to grasp for the same<br/>reasons. I think the &quot;too many notes&quot; thing stems from a misconception<br/>that you have to mentally deal with all of those notes at the same<br/>time.</p><p>//</p><p>&gt;&gt; &gt; The AXiS is competitively priced with halberstadt MIDI keyboards.<br/>&gt;&gt; &gt; I looked at several by Kawai and Yamaha that were as expensive<br/>&gt;&gt; &gt; just the other day. They were also total junk FWIW.<br/>&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt; Yeah, it&apos;s $1700. It&apos;s almost twice as expensive as a Fender Rhodes<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; How you figure?

You could start your own<br/>mailing list.

I&apos;d be happy with a prediction rate of 75-85%.</p><p>You&apos;re easy to please then!  But anyway I suggest you do<br/>more researching and less proposing.</p><p>&gt; does Rothenberg&apos;s model address people with absolute pitch?</p><p>Not that I can remember.</p><p>&gt; I am blessed with the ability but I find little to no research<br/>&gt; involving it in a microtonal sense... When I hear a melody, I<br/>&gt; don&apos;t hear up/down/up, but rather A B A or something, so it<br/>&gt; isn&apos;t that I hear music in terms of just intervals. I can see<br/>&gt; what Rothenberg&apos;s talking about, but for me there is this<br/>&gt; virtual conflict -- let&apos;s say you have a melody ascending in<br/>&gt; major whole tones and then descending in minor whole tones. If<br/>&gt; the melody ends up a half step higher from where it started,<br/>&gt; for example, I will be very very confused, as I&apos;ll hear whole<br/>&gt; tones in either direction, but that will be in conflict with<br/>&gt; the fact that the end note I&apos;m hearing is much different from<br/>&gt; the start note.</p><p>Sounds like you&apos;re still listening to intervals then.  If you<br/>can recognize themes transposed into the relative minor and<br/>such, then you are doing what Rothenberg is concerned with,<br/>which is assigning scale degrees to pitches.  You recognize<br/>the theme by the fact it still has the same pattern of scale<br/>intervals (5th 3rd 2nd etc.) even though the pitches and even<br/>the qualities of the intervals (major 3rd vs. minor 3rd) are<br/>different.</p><p>&gt; &gt; Oh, it gets far worse that that! Know anything about<br/>&gt; &gt; &quot;music set theory&quot;?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I just gave it a look on Wikipedia. My main beef with it is<br/>&gt; that it&apos;s one step away from JI, which is what really needs<br/>&gt; to be taught in schools, IMO. Might be useful for something,<br/>&gt; I can&apos;t tell from the first glance. The concept of an<br/>&gt; &quot;interval vector&quot; I found to be laughable.</p><p>It&apos;s what serialism morphed into.  They publish lots of papers<br/>explaining the rules of common practice music based on these<br/>arcane (and acoustically meaningless) pitch transformations.<br/>Many of the celebrated results in the field don&apos;t work if you<br/>try to apply them in, say, 31-ET instead of 12-ET.  Even though<br/>by all accounts lots of music sounds just fine (if not<br/>better) in 31.</p><p>&gt; OK, let me give you a better example - something a little<br/>&gt; E further from the harmonic series. how about C Eb G Bb D F Ab?<br/>&gt; That Ab on the top to my ears sounds pretty weak structurally,</p><p>Alright, I&apos;ve demonstrated the techniques.  What do you think?</p><p>&gt; Jazz has this concept of &quot;avoid notes&quot; - over major, you&apos;re<br/>&gt; supposed to avoid playing the 4th scale degree for too long<br/>&gt; over a major chord.  In Aeolian, you&apos;re supposed to avoid<br/>&gt; playing the b6 for too long. My teacher was basically trying<br/>&gt; to teach me that concept in the context of harmony.</p><p>It would be interesting to try and reverse engineer avoid<br/>note rules.  They may be just capture what early players<br/>happened to do (&quot;frozen accidents&quot;), or they may capture a<br/>something deeper.  &apos;Omit the 3rd&apos; may make sense in the<br/>following manner:</p><p>* you can&apos;t have the 4:5 in the bass because it could get<br/>muddy (due to critical band effects)<br/>* if you put the 4:7 in the bass and the other identities<br/>in the treble you&apos;re putting them in a different order than<br/>they first appear in the harmonic series<br/>* if you put the 4:6 in the bass and the 5:7 in the treble<br/>you run the risk of evoking polytonality<br/>* if you omit the 7 you don&apos;t have anything new<br/>* that leaves &apos;omit the 4 (3rd)&apos;</p><p>&gt; &gt; Yes. That&apos;s musical context and its study is really out of<br/>&gt; &gt; the scope of tuning theory. But if you want to post your<br/>&gt; &gt; findings here people will probably be receptive, especially<br/>&gt; &gt; if you use alternate tunings in your experiments. But if<br/>&gt; &gt; you just want to ask about it here it&apos;s probably not the<br/>&gt; &gt; right venue.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Alright, fair enough. Perhaps it would be a better question<br/>&gt; for the MMM group.</p><p>I guess there&apos;s only one way to find out...</p><p>&gt; So then I suppose an alternate question is, C E G Bb D F sounds<br/>&gt; pretty weak, but C E G Bb D F# sounds quite strong to me.<br/>&gt; 11/4 is halfway between the F and the F#.  Why does that<br/>&gt; F# work so well? Is it just that the F# is out of the way of<br/>&gt; the field of attraction of the 4/3, and so that it can jump<br/>&gt; to the 11/4 more easily?</p><p>Bingo.  F is really close to 8/3, but 8/3 doesn&apos;t fit into the<br/>chord because the root is a power of 2 to all the other notes.</p><p>&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; You and me both. We could buy a bunch of AXiSes and<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; refretted guitars and pitch a workshop to Berklee. I&apos;d<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; bet they&apos;d go for it. Might even give us some money.<br/>//<br/>&gt; &gt; We could write a grant, or suggest to Berklee that they<br/>&gt; &gt; pay us for giving the workshop.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I&apos;m down. //<br/>&gt; There are a -lot- of schools that I know of that would be<br/>&gt; interested in such a program, the University of Miami and USC.</p><p>Want to take it off-list and come up with a proposal together?</p><p>&gt; It would be good to build some kind of &quot;course&quot; to facilitate<br/>&gt; the learning of this - perhaps people could start with something<br/>&gt; simple such as 19- or 17-tet.</p><p>I think 19 is ideal for guitars.  17 is too weird for a first<br/>attempt at mass appeal, though Jacob Barton has hosted a series<br/>of very successful events based around it (look up &quot;17-tone<br/>piano project&quot; if you&apos;re not familiar).  For keyboards I<br/>think 31 is a nice choice.  But to harmonize with the guitars<br/>maybe everybody should do 19.</p><p>&gt; Hell, maybe even throw in 5-tet before that just to get<br/>&gt; them quickly accustomed to the fact that not everything<br/>&gt; besides 12-tet sounds &quot;weird.&quot; From there it might be nice<br/>&gt; to jump up to something like 31, so they can jump into<br/>&gt; 7-limit and 11-limit music fairly quickly.</p><p>I think doing improv in 5 and 7 first would be a good idea,<br/>at least for the keyboards.</p><p>&gt; Alternately, we could let them screw around with the Axis&apos;<br/>&gt; harmonic table in pure 5 or 7-limit just</p><p>Yeah, that&apos;d be good.</p><p>&gt; (if we can get a decent 7-limit pattern going for it)</p><p>I don&apos;t think that&apos;ll be a problem.  :)</p><p>&gt; $640, good condition Mk. 1 stage.</p><p>Have you ever owned a Rhodes?  You couldn&apos;t pay me $640 to<br/>take it.</p><p>&gt; &gt; By the way, I believe the Access TI has built-in Hermode<br/>&gt; &gt; tuning. (<a href="http://www.hermode.com">www.hermode.com</a>)<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Damn. I really need to get one of those keyboards. I&apos;m stuck<br/>&gt; between that and the Nord Electro, which has no microtonal<br/>&gt; functionality whatsoever, but awesome electroacoustic samples<br/>&gt; to boast. I am torn.</p><p>I came so close to buying an electro.  Yup, the sounds are<br/>good ( for a sampler :P ).  But nord instruments are kind of<br/>candy-assed  in some way and definitely overpriced.  You should<br/>totally check out the hermode site in depth if you haven&apos;t.  My<br/>current object of desire is a Kurzweil PC3.  Yum.

How does this stuff apply outside of diatonic scale theory...? Or<br/>does he propose rather that the whole thing be fit into diatonic scale<br/>theory?</p><p>As in, the 12tet octatonic scale - C Db D# E F# G A Bb C can be viewed<br/>as having two separate 2nd&apos;s or 9th&apos;s, a b9 and a #9...<br/>Or the &quot;altered scale,&quot; C Db Eb Fb Gb Ab Bb C - which is usually<br/>viewed in jazz theory more as C Db D# E F#/Gb G#/Ab Bb C, as if it has<br/>two types of 9ths and notes that serve dual functions for different<br/>kinds of fifths and sixths..</p><p>The octatonic scale in particular having 8 notes but often being<br/>viewed as having 7 with two possible 9ths. Is he saying that is<br/>because jazz musicians often haven&apos;t acquired the &quot;skill&quot; of hearing<br/>all 8 notes in relation to one another, so they just fit it into their<br/>existing paradigm of being the alterations of the existing 7 notes<br/>that they have? Same with the altered scale... that you need to learn<br/>to hear C-Fb as a kind of FOURTH rather than fitting it into ones<br/>concept as a major third?</p><p>If that&apos;s what he&apos;s saying, then that&apos;s the kind of stuff I&apos;m<br/>proposing be taught in jazz schools and such around the country.<br/>That&apos;s basically a huge step forward in my mind as it relates to<br/>improvements in music theory in education. And if that&apos;s not what he&apos;s<br/>saying, then I&apos;m taking credit for it and calling it the<br/>&quot;Battagliastic principle of intervallic mapping.&quot;</p><p>&gt; It&apos;s what serialism morphed into. They publish lots of papers<br/>&gt; explaining the rules of common practice music based on these<br/>&gt; arcane (and acoustically meaningless) pitch transformations.<br/>&gt; Many of the celebrated results in the field don&apos;t work if you<br/>&gt; try to apply them in, say, 31-ET instead of 12-ET. Even though<br/>&gt; by all accounts lots of music sounds just fine (if not<br/>&gt; better) in 31.</p><p>Acoustically meaningless being the key term. I did some more research<br/>into the field and found that I had actually encountered the concept<br/>on a &quot;music theory&quot; test I had taken online a while ago just for<br/>fun... I ran into this stuff on the third or fourth page and was<br/>baffled. I figured it out pretty quickly as being scale steps, as many<br/>of the examples corresponded to simple 12tet major or minor chords,<br/>but it&apos;s stuff like that that&apos;s being taught as &quot;high-level&quot; music<br/>theory gospel that only further cements people into the 12tet fold and<br/>takes them further confused as to where it all comes from.</p><p>&gt;&gt; OK, let me give you a better example - something a little<br/>&gt;&gt; E further from the harmonic series. how about C Eb G Bb D F Ab?<br/>&gt;&gt; That Ab on the top to my ears sounds pretty weak structurally,<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Alright, I&apos;ve demonstrated the techniques. What do you think?</p><p>I think it makes sense for the first chord, but I don&apos;t see how it<br/>relates to the second one I posted above, as I deliberately picked one<br/>that was further from the harmonic series just to see how the<br/>techniques would apply there. I&apos;m not sure how they carry over to<br/>things like that. Intuitively I feel that that G-Ab is really what is<br/>causing it, but maybe not, because if you take the G out, it still<br/>sounds weird. Maybe psychoacoustically the G is implied...? I didn&apos;t<br/>get enough information from your<br/>first explanation to see immediately how it would tie over into a case<br/>like this.</p><p>Plus the Eb differing immediately from the expected E in the harmonic<br/>series would cause its own harmonic entropy increase, but THAT doesn&apos;t<br/>destabilize the chord.</p><p>Is that b9 dissonance just too hard to take at times?</p><p>&gt;&gt; Jazz has this concept of &quot;avoid notes&quot; - over major, you&apos;re<br/>&gt;&gt; supposed to avoid playing the 4th scale degree for too long<br/>&gt;&gt; over a major chord. In Aeolian, you&apos;re supposed to avoid<br/>&gt;&gt; playing the b6 for too long. My teacher was basically trying<br/>&gt;&gt; to teach me that concept in the context of harmony.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; It would be interesting to try and reverse engineer avoid<br/>&gt; note rules. They may be just capture what early players<br/>&gt; happened to do (&quot;frozen accidents&quot;), or they may capture a<br/>&gt; something deeper.</p><p>Yeah, the avoid note rules are basically just the melodic versions of<br/>the &quot;no b9&quot; rule as outlined above. If you look closely, all of the<br/>avoid notes usually talked about are just places where a b9 exists<br/>over some other note. Intuitively I feel that something deeper is<br/>happening, and that it has something to do with the b9 rule, but that<br/>there is some effect beyond that that has to do with<br/>sum-and-difference tones or perhaps the harmonic entropy as you<br/>outlined above, though I still can&apos;t see how to apply the techniques<br/>to chords that don&apos;t resemble the harmonic series.</p><p>&gt; &apos;Omit the 3rd&apos; may make sense in the following manner:</p><p>Hm. Usually the fifth is being omitted, not the third... The third and<br/>seventh are usually seen as &quot;color&quot; tones, and intuitively it does<br/>seem to make sense. I think it has to do with the principle of<br/>anchoring mentioned earlier... C G Bb doesn&apos;t imply major or minor and<br/>so the amount of information/entropy is low. C E Bb does imply a major<br/>and gives the kind of 7th chord that it is as well.</p><p>&gt; * you can&apos;t have the 4:5 in the bass because it could get<br/>&gt; muddy (due to critical band effects)</p><p>Yis.</p><p>&gt; * if you put the 4:7 in the bass and the other identities<br/>&gt; in the treble you&apos;re putting them in a different order than<br/>&gt; they first appear in the harmonic series</p><p>So you don&apos;t like chord voicings along the lines of C Bb E G D?<br/>Usually I hear those chords played more often in jazz as the added<br/>&quot;crunch&quot; from putting them in that sort of inversion implies the<br/>tonality of the chord more, not less</p><p>&gt; * if you put the 4:6 in the bass and the 5:7 in the treble<br/>&gt; you run the risk of evoking polytonality</p><p>Er, you mean like C G E Bb or something?

Are your guidelines here for how<br/>to voice tetrads in 4 parts?</p><p>&gt;&gt; &gt; Yes. That&apos;s musical context and its study is really out of<br/>&gt;&gt; &gt; the scope of tuning theory. But if you want to post your<br/>&gt;&gt; &gt; findings here people will probably be receptive, especially<br/>&gt;&gt; &gt; if you use alternate tunings in your experiments.

Why does that<br/>&gt;&gt; F# work so well? Is it just that the F# is out of the way of<br/>&gt;&gt; the field of attraction of the 4/3, and so that it can jump<br/>&gt;&gt; to the 11/4 more easily?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Bingo. F is really close to 8/3, but 8/3 doesn&apos;t fit into the<br/>&gt; chord because the root is a power of 2 to all the other notes.</p><p>Right. So how about actual dominant seventh chords, like 36:45:54:64?<br/>That Bb as a 16/9 fits in pretty nice to me, even if that chord is<br/>used as a tonic. I find it has a different, much brighter feel than<br/>4:5:6:7, and works itself as a tonic for a kind of &quot;going places,<br/>unresolved&quot; feel.</p><p>So how come, over a major chord, the note that is two fourths down<br/>fits in to make a &quot;strong&quot; chord, but the note that is one fourth down<br/>does not? Would you say that I&apos;m still hearing 16/9 as just a brighter<br/>type of 7/4, or as 16/9 in its own right?</p><p>Actually, I was just thinking, that principle of learning melodic<br/>intervals as a &quot;skill&quot; might be useful in harmony as well. If you&apos;re<br/>accustomed to 16/9 for dominant chords your whole life, when you first<br/>hear 4:5:6:7, you might think it IS a dominant chord that needs to<br/>resolve, as many do. After you listen to the chord enough though, you<br/>become accustomed to it being a consonance that is unresolved in its<br/>own right, and you acquire the &quot;skill&quot; to map that consonance out.<br/>When I first heard 21/8 used in a chord, as in 16:20:24:28:35:42...<br/>(two major chords, the second built off of the 7/4 of the first) I<br/>first thought it WAS 4/3, and intuitively I was like &quot;aw, that sounds<br/>weird...&quot; But after listening to it for a bit longer, I ended up<br/>realizing that it is in fact its own.</p><p>&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; You and me both.

I am torn.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I came so close to buying an electro. Yup, the sounds are<br/>&gt; good ( for a sampler :P ). But nord instruments are kind of<br/>&gt; candy-assed in some way and definitely overpriced. You should<br/>&gt; totally check out the hermode site in depth if you haven&apos;t. My<br/>&gt; current object of desire is a Kurzweil PC3. Yum. But it costs<br/>&gt; more than an AXiS.</p><p>They&apos;re candy-assed in that they have no effects. The nord electro 2<br/>has some effects, but lacks basic things like reverb and delay. I hate<br/>them so much. I have a nord lead 2, which is sort of useful, though<br/>I&apos;d trade it and one of my limbs for an Access TI Polar anyway. The<br/>Nord lead 2 has no effects at all, although I made a patch that sweeps<br/>through the harmonic series with it when I move the mod wheel. It&apos;s<br/>pretty fun to go up to the 7th overtone and just play in 12tet... You<br/>can get some interesting sounds that way. Plus, by splitting the patch<br/>so that the left half of the keyboard is a normal 12tet setup and the<br/>right half is down a septimal comma, you can play subminor triads and<br/>supermajor triads and stuff live and have a good ol&apos; time.</p><p>As for the Kurzweil PC3, I haven&apos;t heard much of it. I just looked up<br/>some videos on it and it sounds really good, although I&apos;ll have to<br/>hear the clavinet sounds before I really make my decision.</p><p>&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; // and you still have to connect it to a computer and //<br/>&gt;&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt;&gt; &gt; It&apos;s a bit of a pain I admit but not one that warrants the<br/>&gt;&gt; &gt; number of complaints I hear about it.<br/>&gt; //<br/>&gt;&gt; horn players and guitarists and such are pretty much left out<br/>&gt;&gt; of the fold here.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; What use have they for synths?</p><p>I just mean that those people have to be taken into account too, or<br/>else in an ensemble situation you&apos;re going to have one microtonal<br/>keyboard player and three people stuck in 12tet.</p><p>&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; Never mind the fact that if you want decent samples<br/>&gt;&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt;&gt; &gt; Samples??

Which begs the question: what ARE we hearing?<br/>&gt; What is the nature<br/>&gt; of this change in character, and what does this character mean?</p><p>The character of different intervals is something I&apos;ve been focussing<br/>on for quite a while. Obviously this is kind of a given in musical<br/>performance, so more specifically, the character of intervals in the<br/>context of the tuning.</p><p>Be forewarned that Carl has called my ideas &quot;eye of newt&quot; :-D but<br/>here goes: every interval has a character and in a tuning that hangs<br/>together, or in which all seems &quot;of a kind&quot; or &quot;from the same<br/>pallete&quot;, the intervals share certain color/feeling characteristics.<br/>So I listen for &quot;character families&quot;. An obvious one is like the<br/>slightly upwardly detuned 5/4 you mentioned before- it&apos;s a little<br/>brighter. If you take for example 34-equal, there are genuine<br/>approximations of 6/5 and 5/4; at two cents away it would be kooky to<br/>pretend that there isn&apos;t an obvious relation between the m3 and M3 of<br/>34-equal, and those of the harmonic partials. They&apos;re the &quot;same&quot; on<br/>one hand, but both are two cents higher and brighter in character on<br/>the other.  Throw in the even brighter 34-equal &quot;3/2&quot; and you&apos;ve got<br/>a very clear character family right there in the first six partials:<br/>bright and brassy.</p><p>Looking at things this way, it&apos;s easy to imagine that a whole tuning<br/>can have a certain character, or &quot;red thread&quot;. I call it an<br/>uebertimbre to irk Carl, but in seriousness it&apos;s a Gesamtklangfarbe.</p><p> When you have intervals, whether rational or &quot;irrational&quot;, that<br/>create coincident or near-concident partials with great regularity,<br/>you tend to put weight in specific places in the spectra. If you plot<br/>the partials of say a complete &quot;7-limit&quot; u- and o-tonality tuning, it<br/>is not hard to imagine that the regions coinciding with seventh<br/>partials tend to get reinforced in a piece of music. As you can<br/>easily demonstrate with an additive synthesizer, putting more energy<br/>into the seventh partial makes for a different tone color.</p><p>Obviously a tuning in and of itself isn&apos;t enough to really have a<br/>Gesamtklangfarbe, it&apos;s really a potential Gesamtklangfarbe because<br/>key and modality also write the overall timbre- for example, a<br/>secondary key center or an insistent figure can create a kind of<br/>&quot;formant&quot; in the overall spectral envelope of the piece.</p><p>(Really wide voicings and punctalism would probably throw the whole<br/>thing to the dogs, but that is nothing new, these things have been<br/>effective tools of &quot;atonalists&quot; for a long time.)</p><p>Another thing that is common in distinctive and attractive instrument<br/>timbres is gaps-and-lumps in the partials, analize a violin sound for<br/>example. In my experience, gaps-and-lumps in the overall field of<br/>coincident partials that a tuning tends to reinforce is a good thing.<br/>So after long poking around with my ears at tuning until it floats my<br/>boat, I (always?) find upon examination that has characteristics like<br/>&quot;primes: 2,3,5,23&quot; or &quot;2,5,7,73&quot; and so on.</p><p>Notice that &quot;73&quot; or any extremely high partial needs absolutely no<br/>numerology or wild claims of human hearing ability to be &quot;justified&quot;.<br/>73/64 is four cents from 8/7 so we&apos;re hearing something which is<br/>both  a thing of its own, and a flavor of 8/7. Other high partials<br/>are great for blurring other regions- 23/18 for example splits the<br/>difference between 9/7 and 14/11, and a &quot;23&quot; tuning (o&apos;s and u&apos;s to<br/>use Partch&apos;s charmingly ridiculous but effective terminology) can<br/>both blur the seventh partial while at the same time perhaps be on<br/>the edge of hearing as &quot;Just&quot;. These tasty and functional &quot;blurred&quot;<br/>regions I call &quot;shadows&quot;- 23/18 is an example, another kind would be<br/>found at a 25/24 above 5/4, which works as a kind of bright 13/10 (&lt;<br/>2.8 cents high) and is obviously nicely linked to 5/4 for smooth<br/>rides in and out of shadow and light.</p><p>I would think that this all sounds quite tame and maybe even common-<br/>sensical. The other day I read about the &quot;spectralists&quot; here (BTW<br/>thanks for the information and links, guys!), a school I wasn&apos;t aware<br/>of. As far as I can make out a lot of what I do is about the same, at<br/>heart, only backwards. No big deal.</p><p>But if you think about it, you will realize how easily this can come<br/>into conflict with the regular temperament paradigm. (I am not<br/>putting &quot;regular temperament paradigm&quot; in quotes because I think it&apos;s<br/>a serious thing and the guys here involved in defining it should be<br/>proud of,not embarrassed by, the expression.) Right off the bat, it<br/>is clear that if there&apos;s any legitamcy to this approach, reckoning<br/>&quot;errors&quot; in temperaments would be a very big pain in the ass, for a<br/>greater &quot;error&quot; (deviation from Just) in an interval could very well<br/>mean more, and not less, continuity in &quot;flavor&quot; or &quot;hue&quot; or whatever.<br/>And &quot;shadows&quot;, or zones of ambiguity, rely on NOT being good<br/>approximations of intervals, but on being in the (right) wrong place<br/>in the audible spectrum.</p><p>Add to this the probability that it&apos;s the gapped-and-lumped spectra<br/>that make for the nicest<br/>&quot;Gesamtflangfarben&quot;, and we&apos;re looking at &quot;good&quot; temperaments that<br/>might appear on paper to be pretty crappy. As you have certainly<br/>noticed, 12-tET, all questions of taste aside, is might flexible, and<br/>it fits the kind of description I gave above: &quot;damn near perfect 2<br/>and 3, and some 19&quot; The 19 is not the &quot;justification&quot; of 12-tET,<br/>though who knows if there&apos;s some far-away feeling of it or not-<br/>doesn&apos;t matter. &quot;19&quot; just a rough description of the place the<br/>&quot;shadows&quot; of 12-tET dwell. In the case of 12-tET, it&apos;s the size and<br/>vagueness of the shadow zones that make it flexible, but when 12-tET<br/>is taken literally they&apos;re just too damn big and blurry IMO.</p><p>Anyway gotta run soon, take care</p><p>&gt;<br/>&gt; What is it that we hear when we hear a 12tet major chord? Often<br/>this chord<br/>&gt; is cited as having a relatively in-tune 3/2 and a slightly out-of-<br/>tune<br/>&gt; 5/4... But is there some other way that we are really hearing it?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Do we psychologically &quot;move&quot; these ratios to the nearest JI one, or<br/>the<br/>&gt; simplest one, or...?  If I play a JI minor chord with the minor<br/>third as<br/>&gt; 19/16 am I hearing THAT as an out of tune 6/5?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I think the context of it might matter. There is definitely some<br/>difference<br/>&gt; between 11-tet and 12-tet, for example. 12-tet offers better<br/>&quot;matches&quot; to<br/>&gt; intervals in the harmonic series. So to SOME extent, imposing some<br/>kind of<br/>&gt; JI-related structure on equal temperaments offers useful results.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Take the following 2 chords:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; 1:2:3:4:5:6<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; and<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; 100:200:300:400:504:600<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; You will still most likely hear the resemblence to the overtone<br/>series and<br/>&gt; hear that context superimposed over the second chord. The sharpened<br/>&quot;5&quot; will<br/>&gt; cause some beating that you may or may not like, depending on the<br/>context. I<br/>&gt; hear the second one as &quot;vibrant,&quot; &quot;exciting,&quot; etc. You might also<br/>view it as<br/>&gt; &quot;dissonant&quot; and an &quot;out-of-tune&quot; version of 1:2:3:4:5:6. However,<br/>you might<br/>&gt; ALSO view that second chord as an &quot;inversion&quot; of a completely<br/>different JI<br/>&gt; chord, which would presumably act in a different way if you take<br/>into<br/>&gt; account the &quot;traditional&quot; ways that chord inversions and such are<br/>viewed -<br/>&gt; and these ways were groundbreaking in their own time and evolved<br/>out of<br/>&gt; their own realizations.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I.E.: the two approaches give differing results, and thus something<br/>in the<br/>&gt; overall theory is inconsistent. All known musical truths will never<br/>be<br/>&gt; accessible through any axiomatic system - but it might be useful to<br/>at least<br/>&gt; make the current one consistent. As I see it (and I feel this is a<br/>fairly<br/>&gt; common perspective), the way many of us have been taught music<br/>theory in<br/>&gt; school fails to explain microtonal theory (see above for the b9<br/>example),<br/>&gt; and the way many of us currently see microtonal theory fails to<br/>explain good<br/>&gt; ol&apos; fashioned 12tet music theory from school (the areas in which it<br/>DOES<br/>&gt; work). If these two could be reconciled, I think it would be good.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; So to restate the question:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Why do we sometimes hear intervals &quot;guided&quot; to their nearest match<br/>in a<br/>&gt; harmonic series, and why do we sometimes hear them as new entities<br/>in their<br/>&gt; own right with different feelings and characters to them?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Or, in a more general sense, what causes someone to hear a certain<br/>interval<br/>&gt; as a mistuned form of another interval?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; OR, in its *broadest* sense, what causes someone, when experiencing<br/>a<br/>&gt; phenomenon, to view that phenomenon as an altered version of another<br/>&gt; phenomenon?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Sometimes we get into &quot;well the brain does this&quot; or &quot;the brain does<br/>that,&quot;<br/>&gt; and I think those answers often fall short of the truth.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; -Mike<br/>&gt;</p></div><h3>Mike Battaglia &#x3C;battaglia01@...&#x3E;</h3><span>6/10/2008 3:12:59 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>&gt; The character of different intervals is something I&apos;ve been focussing<br/>&gt; on for quite a while.

If you take for example 34-equal, there are genuine<br/>&gt; approximations of 6/5 and 5/4; at two cents away it would be kooky to<br/>&gt; pretend that there isn&apos;t an obvious relation between the m3 and M3 of<br/>&gt; 34-equal, and those of the harmonic partials. They&apos;re the &quot;same&quot; on<br/>&gt; one hand, but both are two cents higher and brighter in character on<br/>&gt; the other. Throw in the even brighter 34-equal &quot;3/2&quot; and you&apos;ve got<br/>&gt; a very clear character family right there in the first six partials:<br/>&gt; bright and brassy.</p><p>Yeah! That&apos;s always what attracted me to 17-tet, the wider fifths. I<br/>think it usually sounds good because widening them slightly<br/>accentuates the intervals that we&apos;re already used to. I also<br/>hypothesize that it might be because of some resemblance to the<br/>stretched harmonic series that we often hear in nature (although it<br/>could just be my own bias). This is why I always liked 12-tet more<br/>than 19-tet - the third and fifth (and harmonic 7th) are all flat in<br/>19-tet, so everything sounds compressed and less accentuated. It<br/>sounds like my brain is getting compressed. Although, the more I<br/>listen to 19-tet, the more I like it, so it may just be my own bias<br/>towards wider intervals that is being expressed here.</p><p>I suppose some cross-culture listening tests would have to be<br/>performed in order to determine whether that theory is due to a<br/>cultural bias for wider intervals (e.g. the 12tet major third) or<br/>whether it has some acoustic basis. Honestly I think that the apparent<br/>duality here can be resolved by noting that while there is likely SOME<br/>acoustic basis on what you initially hear, the matter of whether you<br/>LIKE what your brain shows you after all of this acoustic and<br/>psychoacoustic stuff goes down is a different mental process entirely.<br/>And then what you like or prefer makes up part of your overall<br/>perception, or Gestalt.</p><p>&gt; Looking at things this way, it&apos;s easy to imagine that a whole tuning<br/>&gt; can have a certain character, or &quot;red thread&quot;. I call it an<br/>&gt; uebertimbre to irk Carl, but in seriousness it&apos;s a Gesamtklangfarbe.</p><p>Hahaha what? Gezundheit</p><p>&gt; When you have intervals, whether rational or &quot;irrational&quot;, that<br/>&gt; create coincident or near-concident partials with great regularity,<br/>&gt; you tend to put weight in specific places in the spectra. If you plot<br/>&gt; the partials of say a complete &quot;7-limit&quot; u- and o-tonality tuning, it<br/>&gt; is not hard to imagine that the regions coinciding with seventh<br/>&gt; partials tend to get reinforced in a piece of music. As you can<br/>&gt; easily demonstrate with an additive synthesizer, putting more energy<br/>&gt; into the seventh partial makes for a different tone color.</p><p>I remember hearing an example on the web of a JI major chord as<br/>compared to the 12tet major chord. The website claimed that the equal<br/>tempered one sounded better, and for their example, it did. Then they<br/>had a JI major chord in which the notes were phase shifted so that I<br/>think the 5th harmonic of the fundamental cancelled out with the 4th<br/>harmonic of the major third, and it sounded much better, though I&apos;m<br/>not sure why that particular overtone was so offensive.</p><p>&gt; Obviously a tuning in and of itself isn&apos;t enough to really have a<br/>&gt; Gesamtklangfarbe, it&apos;s really a potential Gesamtklangfarbe because<br/>&gt; key and modality also write the overall timbre- for example, a<br/>&gt; secondary key center or an insistent figure can create a kind of<br/>&gt; &quot;formant&quot; in the overall spectral envelope of the piece.</p><p>Interesting ideas. I&apos;d like to hear some musical examples that utilize<br/>this for some interesting effect. Apparently gesamtklangfarbe<br/>translates to &quot;total tone quality,&quot; which is a term I&apos;ve never heard<br/>before.</p><p>&gt; (Really wide voicings and punctalism would probably throw the whole<br/>&gt; thing to the dogs, but that is nothing new, these things have been<br/>&gt; effective tools of &quot;atonalists&quot; for a long time.)</p><p>It would be awesome if there was some software that let you screw<br/>around with JI chords and inharmonicity as such. Would most likely be<br/>interesting in the end.</p><p>&gt; Another thing that is common in distinctive and attractive instrument<br/>&gt; timbres is gaps-and-lumps in the partials, analize a violin sound for<br/>&gt; example. In my experience, gaps-and-lumps in the overall field of<br/>&gt; coincident partials that a tuning tends to reinforce is a good thing.<br/>&gt; So after long poking around with my ears at tuning until it floats my<br/>&gt; boat, I (always?) find upon examination that has characteristics like<br/>&gt; &quot;primes: 2,3,5,23&quot; or &quot;2,5,7,73&quot; and so on.</p><p>Interesting. Probably due to resonant effects of the body or something.</p><p>&gt; Notice that &quot;73&quot; or any extremely high partial needs absolutely no<br/>&gt; numerology or wild claims of human hearing ability to be &quot;justified&quot;.<br/>&gt; 73/64 is four cents from 8/7 so we&apos;re hearing something which is<br/>&gt; both a thing of its own, and a flavor of 8/7.</p><p>Yeah. That&apos;s the key. That&apos;s why I had second thoughts about the<br/>assertions made above that a dominant 7 chord where the 7 is 16/9 will<br/>be interpreted &quot;by the brain&quot; as being an out of tune 7/4. It&apos;s just<br/>that 7/4 and 16/9 are fairly close in the pitch continuum, so<br/>naturally they&apos;ll sound similar. The whole thing seems to ignore the<br/>fact that these intervals have characters of their own as well; they<br/>are not merely mistuned versions of other simpler intervals, although<br/>you might hear them that way at first. You might also hear the simpler<br/>intervals as mistunings of the more complicated ones, which is why<br/>when people used to 12-tet hear music in just intonation for the first<br/>time sometimes think it &quot;sounds wrong,&quot; even if there is no commatic<br/>drift or the like.</p><p>I think these fields of attraction are merely a way to describe the<br/>phenomenon of how and under what circumstances we hear a resemblance<br/>to the harmonic series in tempered or non-harmonic (or upper JI<br/>harmonic) intervals.</p><p>It&apos;s like this image: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Image:Invariance.jpg">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Image:Invariance.jpg</a></p><p>&quot;A&quot; is the original object, and &quot;D&quot; is a distorted version of the same<br/>object. The concept of a field of attraction is merely I think is an<br/>attempt to explain how much of that distortion we can take before we<br/>stop seeing it as the same object. However, saying that the images in<br/>D are ONLY good at being &quot;slightly erroneous&quot; versions of the objects<br/>in picture A is taking it too far. After all, no axiomatic theory is<br/>complete (hint, hint).</p><p>I think a more accurate approach is that a person might interpret 16/9<br/>as an out-of-tune 7/4 if they are used to hearing 7/4 and not at all<br/>to hearing 16/9. They might then become used to 16/9 as a separate<br/>interval in its own right later. This is why I am wary of labeling one<br/>particular person&apos;s response to an interval or chord as though it were<br/>something the &quot;brain&quot; does. One person&apos;s brain might exhibit a certain<br/>behavior as the neurological correlate of a psychological<br/>interpretation, but then attempting to generalize that behavior to<br/>-all- people falls prey to the same fallacy that is currently ruining<br/>how music theory is being taught in America.</p><p>Here&apos;s a simple example to demonstrate that concept... Play a 12 bar<br/>blues, where the chords are 4:5:6:7. Let&apos;s say it&apos;s in the key of C.<br/>Right before the C goes to F, change the 7th of the C chord to be<br/>16/9, as in change it from an otonal tetrad to a pythagorean<br/>&quot;dominant&quot; 7, that resolves as a V-I to the next chord. see if you<br/>feel a difference!</p><p>Another way to say all of this is that you perhaps DEVELOP your fields<br/>of attraction to intervals over time, depending on when you hear them.</p><p>&gt; Other high partials<br/>&gt; are great for blurring other regions- 23/18 for example splits the<br/>&gt; difference between 9/7 and 14/11, and a &quot;23&quot; tuning (o&apos;s and u&apos;s to<br/>&gt; use Partch&apos;s charmingly ridiculous but effective terminology)</p><p>I never really understood the otonality and utonality thing... It<br/>makes sense at first but breaks down the further you get into it. A<br/>minor chord is both a utonality and an otonality, depending on how you<br/>look at it. So is a major chord.</p><p>&gt; can both blur the seventh partial while at the same time perhaps be on<br/>&gt; the edge of hearing as &quot;Just&quot;. These tasty and functional &quot;blurred&quot;<br/>&gt; regions I call &quot;shadows&quot;- 23/18 is an example, another kind would be<br/>&gt; found at a 25/24 above 5/4, which works as a kind of bright 13/10 (&lt;<br/>&gt; 2.8 cents high) and is obviously nicely linked to 5/4 for smooth<br/>&gt; rides in and out of shadow and light.</p><p>Yeah, this is sort of related to the original question I was asking...<br/>Is it that the 12tet major third approximates 5/4 but is really sharp,<br/>or is it that it approximates a higher-prime interval, or is it that<br/>the higher-prime interval itself approximates the lower-prime<br/>interval? Perhaps moving 5/4 up slightly by some irrational number and<br/>ignoring JI altogether would work as well.</p><p>Another example of what you&apos;re talking about here I think is the good<br/>ol&apos; neutral triad... I have a multistable perception of neutral triad<br/>as an out of tune major and an out of tune minor simultaneously. I<br/>suspect that the more I listen to it the more I will get used to it as<br/>a stable chord in its own right, and then that interval will develop<br/>its own &quot;field of attraction&quot; apart from the major and the minor one.</p><p>I suspect that fields of attraction are not drawn around actual<br/>harmonic intervals, but around the MEMORIES we have of intervals. It<br/>has to do with a tendency</p><p>&gt; I would think that this all sounds quite tame and maybe even common-<br/>&gt; sensical. The other day I read about the &quot;spectralists&quot; here (BTW<br/>&gt; thanks for the information and links, guys!), a school I wasn&apos;t aware<br/>&gt; of. As far as I can make out a lot of what I do is about the same, at<br/>&gt; heart, only backwards. No big deal.</p><p>A teacher at my school was talking about the spectralists. I still<br/>haven&apos;t heard any really good examples though. I searched for &quot;Scelsi&quot;<br/>on Youtube and didn&apos;t find much,</p><p>&gt; But if you think about it, you will realize how easily this can come<br/>&gt; into conflict with the regular temperament paradigm. (I am not<br/>&gt; putting &quot;regular temperament paradigm&quot; in quotes because I think it&apos;s<br/>&gt; a serious thing and the guys here involved in defining it should be<br/>&gt; proud of,not embarrassed by, the expression.)</p><p>I have been reading the regular temperament paradigm and find it very<br/>interesting. There are cases where it seems brilliantly insightful and<br/>others where it just seems like one particular way of looking at<br/>certain aspects of harmony and temperament.</p><p>I am starting to become concerned with the &quot;why&quot;&apos;s rather than the<br/>&quot;how&quot;&apos;s... I think one gestalt-related approach might be to state that<br/>if we hear a 12-tet C C G C E G chord, we are likely to hear the<br/>resemblance to the harmonic series and thus hear it that way. However,<br/>people often hear that 12-tet major third as having its own sound,<br/>sticking out and being much brighter than a just 5/4. Sometimes that<br/>12-tet major third sticks out and implies a harmony and tonality of<br/>its own completely separate from the major third.</p><p>The paradigm where everything is completely heard in terms of being<br/>out of tune simple integer just intonation relationships I think is a<br/>good rough start, but ultimately incomplete and inconsistent. It&apos;s an<br/>attempt to describe the resemblance we hear between various tempered<br/>intervals and other intervals in the harmonic series. This resemblance<br/>is often used in equal tempered music to -imply- the existence of a<br/>faux-harmonic series for musical purposes. Different just-intonated<br/>intervals can also be used to imply the harmonic series as well, in<br/>that sense. However, dismissing these intervals as serving -only- that<br/>functionality is a non-sequitur.</p><p>In other words, this view goes wrong when it ignores the -difference-<br/>between the harmonic series versions and the tempered versions.<br/>Usually this difference is dismissed as being an &quot;error,&quot; the<br/>implication being that it is undesirable. Yet, as we&apos;ve seen with<br/>12-tet and 34-tet, this difference is often musical in character and<br/>not at all &quot;erroneous.&quot;</p><p> Not only for atonal music, which often draws from a disregarding of<br/>harmony entirely, but for tonal music as well. The most obvious place<br/>where the system breaks down that I&apos;ve seen in recent memory is the<br/>Wikipedia entry for &quot;41 equal temperament.&quot;</p><p>Take this sentence near the bottom:</p><p>&quot;41-ET also has 6 distinct intervals between a perfect fourth and<br/>perfect fifth, whereas 31-ET has only four; the two additional<br/>intervals are poor matches to the ratios 15:11 and 22:15.&quot;</p><p>It seems to be a common trend among these circles to hear one interval<br/>as a &quot;poor match&quot; to another one. Seems like a matter of not being<br/>used enough to that interval to hear it for what it is. 10 cent<br/>differences in pitch can make quite a difference; we aren&apos;t talking<br/>about a 3 cent distinction here.</p><p>It&apos;s like taking the triangle from letter A in this image<br/>(<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Image:Reification.jpg">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Image:Reification.jpg</a>) and saying it&apos;s a<br/>&quot;poor&quot; match to a triangle because the sides are incomplete.</p><p>&gt; Right off the bat, it is clear that if there&apos;s any legitamcy to this approach, reckoning<br/>&gt; &quot;errors&quot; in temperaments would be a very big pain in the ass, for a<br/>&gt; greater &quot;error&quot; (deviation from Just) in an interval could very well<br/>&gt; mean more, and not less, continuity in &quot;flavor&quot; or &quot;hue&quot; or whatever.<br/>&gt; And &quot;shadows&quot;, or zones of ambiguity, rely on NOT being good<br/>&gt; approximations of intervals, but on being in the (right) wrong place<br/>&gt; in the audible spectrum.</p><p>Agreed. No newts found here.</p><p>&gt; Add to this the probability that it&apos;s the gapped-and-lumped spectra<br/>&gt; that make for the nicest<br/>&gt; &quot;Gesamtflangfarben&quot;, and we&apos;re looking at &quot;good&quot; temperaments that<br/>&gt; might appear on paper to be pretty crappy. As you have certainly<br/>&gt; noticed, 12-tET, all questions of taste aside, is might flexible, and<br/>&gt; it fits the kind of description I gave above: &quot;damn near perfect 2<br/>&gt; and 3, and some 19&quot; The 19 is not the &quot;justification&quot; of 12-tET,<br/>&gt; though who knows if there&apos;s some far-away feeling of it or not-<br/>&gt; doesn&apos;t matter. &quot;19&quot; just a rough description of the place the<br/>&gt; &quot;shadows&quot; of 12-tET dwell. In the case of 12-tET, it&apos;s the size and<br/>&gt; vagueness of the shadow zones that make it flexible, but when 12-tET<br/>&gt; is taken literally they&apos;re just too damn big and blurry IMO.</p><p>Don&apos;t understand this paragraph..

I guess the next question is how one uses them, only for certain things or combinations? Kinda an if /then structure i could see working itself into it as opposed to some rational configuration, such as hexanies made of these etc. While you might it seems like your process of choosing might find such things as the result as opposed to the means.

Which begs the question: what ARE we hearing?<br/>&gt; &gt; What is the nature<br/>&gt; &gt; of this change in character, and what does this character mean?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; The character of different intervals is something I&apos;ve been focussing<br/>&gt; on for quite a while. Obviously this is kind of a given in musical<br/>&gt; performance, so more specifically, the character of intervals in the<br/>&gt; context of the tuning.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Be forewarned that Carl has called my ideas &quot;eye of newt&quot; :-D but<br/>&gt; here goes: every interval has a character and in a tuning that hangs<br/>&gt; together, or in which all seems &quot;of a kind&quot; or &quot;from the same<br/>&gt; pallete&quot;, the intervals share certain color/feeling characteristics.<br/>&gt; So I listen for &quot;character families&quot;. An obvious one is like the<br/>&gt; slightly upwardly detuned 5/4 you mentioned before- it&apos;s a little<br/>&gt; brighter. If you take for example 34-equal, there are genuine<br/>&gt; approximations of 6/5 and 5/4; at two cents away it would be kooky to<br/>&gt; pretend that there isn&apos;t an obvious relation between the m3 and M3 of<br/>&gt; 34-equal, and those of the harmonic partials. They&apos;re the &quot;same&quot; on<br/>&gt; one hand, but both are two cents higher and brighter in character on<br/>&gt; the other. Throw in the even brighter 34-equal &quot;3/2&quot; and you&apos;ve got<br/>&gt; a very clear character family right there in the first six partials:<br/>&gt; bright and brassy.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Looking at things this way, it&apos;s easy to imagine that a whole tuning<br/>&gt; can have a certain character, or &quot;red thread&quot;. I call it an<br/>&gt; uebertimbre to irk Carl, but in seriousness it&apos;s a Gesamtklangfarbe.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; When you have intervals, whether rational or &quot;irrational&quot;, that<br/>&gt; create coincident or near-concident partials with great regularity,<br/>&gt; you tend to put weight in specific places in the spectra. If you plot<br/>&gt; the partials of say a complete &quot;7-limit&quot; u- and o-tonality tuning, it<br/>&gt; is not hard to imagine that the regions coinciding with seventh<br/>&gt; partials tend to get reinforced in a piece of music. As you can<br/>&gt; easily demonstrate with an additive synthesizer, putting more energy<br/>&gt; into the seventh partial makes for a different tone color.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Obviously a tuning in and of itself isn&apos;t enough to really have a<br/>&gt; Gesamtklangfarbe, it&apos;s really a potential Gesamtklangfarbe because<br/>&gt; key and modality also write the overall timbre- for example, a<br/>&gt; secondary key center or an insistent figure can create a kind of<br/>&gt; &quot;formant&quot; in the overall spectral envelope of the piece.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; (Really wide voicings and punctalism would probably throw the whole<br/>&gt; thing to the dogs, but that is nothing new, these things have been<br/>&gt; effective tools of &quot;atonalists&quot; for a long time.)<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Another thing that is common in distinctive and attractive instrument<br/>&gt; timbres is gaps-and-lumps in the partials, analize a violin sound for<br/>&gt; example. In my experience, gaps-and-lumps in the overall field of<br/>&gt; coincident partials that a tuning tends to reinforce is a good thing.<br/>&gt; So after long poking around with my ears at tuning until it floats my<br/>&gt; boat, I (always?) find upon examination that has characteristics like<br/>&gt; &quot;primes: 2,3,5,23&quot; or &quot;2,5,7,73&quot; and so on.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Notice that &quot;73&quot; or any extremely high partial needs absolutely no<br/>&gt; numerology or wild claims of human hearing ability to be &quot;justified&quot;.<br/>&gt; 73/64 is four cents from 8/7 so we&apos;re hearing something which is<br/>&gt; both a thing of its own, and a flavor of 8/7. Other high partials<br/>&gt; are great for blurring other regions- 23/18 for example splits the<br/>&gt; difference between 9/7 and 14/11, and a &quot;23&quot; tuning (o&apos;s and u&apos;s to<br/>&gt; use Partch&apos;s charmingly ridiculous but effective terminology) can<br/>&gt; both blur the seventh partial while at the same time perhaps be on<br/>&gt; the edge of hearing as &quot;Just&quot;. These tasty and functional &quot;blurred&quot;<br/>&gt; regions I call &quot;shadows&quot;- 23/18 is an example, another kind would be<br/>&gt; found at a 25/24 above 5/4, which works as a kind of bright 13/10 (&lt;<br/>&gt; 2.8 cents high) and is obviously nicely linked to 5/4 for smooth<br/>&gt; rides in and out of shadow and light.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I would think that this all sounds quite tame and maybe even common-<br/>&gt; sensical. The other day I read about the &quot;spectralists&quot; here (BTW<br/>&gt; thanks for the information and links, guys!), a school I wasn&apos;t aware<br/>&gt; of. As far as I can make out a lot of what I do is about the same, at<br/>&gt; heart, only backwards. No big deal.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; But if you think about it, you will realize how easily this can come<br/>&gt; into conflict with the regular temperament paradigm. (I am not<br/>&gt; putting &quot;regular temperament paradigm&quot; in quotes because I think it&apos;s<br/>&gt; a serious thing and the guys here involved in defining it should be<br/>&gt; proud of,not embarrassed by, the expression.) Right off the bat, it<br/>&gt; is clear that if there&apos;s any legitamcy to this approach, reckoning<br/>&gt; &quot;errors&quot; in temperaments would be a very big pain in the ass, for a<br/>&gt; greater &quot;error&quot; (deviation from Just) in an interval could very well<br/>&gt; mean more, and not less, continuity in &quot;flavor&quot; or &quot;hue&quot; or whatever.<br/>&gt; And &quot;shadows&quot;, or zones of ambiguity, rely on NOT being good<br/>&gt; approximations of intervals, but on being in the (right) wrong place<br/>&gt; in the audible spectrum.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Add to this the probability that it&apos;s the gapped-and-lumped spectra<br/>&gt; that make for the nicest<br/>&gt; &quot;Gesamtflangfarben&quot;, and we&apos;re looking at &quot;good&quot; temperaments that<br/>&gt; might appear on paper to be pretty crappy. As you have certainly<br/>&gt; noticed, 12-tET, all questions of taste aside, is might flexible, and<br/>&gt; it fits the kind of description I gave above: &quot;damn near perfect 2<br/>&gt; and 3, and some 19&quot; The 19 is not the &quot;justification&quot; of 12-tET,<br/>&gt; though who knows if there&apos;s some far-away feeling of it or not-<br/>&gt; doesn&apos;t matter. &quot;19&quot; just a rough description of the place the<br/>&gt; &quot;shadows&quot; of 12-tET dwell. In the case of 12-tET, it&apos;s the size and<br/>&gt; vagueness of the shadow zones that make it flexible, but when 12-tET<br/>&gt; is taken literally they&apos;re just too damn big and blurry IMO.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Anyway gotta run soon, take care<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; What is it that we hear when we hear a 12tet major chord? Often<br/>&gt; this chord<br/>&gt; &gt; is cited as having a relatively in-tune 3/2 and a slightly out-of-<br/>&gt; tune<br/>&gt; &gt; 5/4... But is there some other way that we are really hearing it?<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; Do we psychologically &quot;move&quot; these ratios to the nearest JI one, or<br/>&gt; the<br/>&gt; &gt; simplest one, or...? If I play a JI minor chord with the minor<br/>&gt; third as<br/>&gt; &gt; 19/16 am I hearing THAT as an out of tune 6/5?<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; I think the context of it might matter. There is definitely some<br/>&gt; difference<br/>&gt; &gt; between 11-tet and 12-tet, for example. 12-tet offers better<br/>&gt; &quot;matches&quot; to<br/>&gt; &gt; intervals in the harmonic series. So to SOME extent, imposing some<br/>&gt; kind of<br/>&gt; &gt; JI-related structure on equal temperaments offers useful results.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; Take the following 2 chords:<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; 1:2:3:4:5:6<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; and<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; 100:200:300:400:504:600<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; You will still most likely hear the resemblence to the overtone<br/>&gt; series and<br/>&gt; &gt; hear that context superimposed over the second chord. The sharpened<br/>&gt; &quot;5&quot; will<br/>&gt; &gt; cause some beating that you may or may not like, depending on the<br/>&gt; context. I<br/>&gt; &gt; hear the second one as &quot;vibrant,&quot; &quot;exciting,&quot; etc. You might also<br/>&gt; view it as<br/>&gt; &gt; &quot;dissonant&quot; and an &quot;out-of-tune&quot; version of 1:2:3:4:5:6. However,<br/>&gt; you might<br/>&gt; &gt; ALSO view that second chord as an &quot;inversion&quot; of a completely<br/>&gt; different JI<br/>&gt; &gt; chord, which would presumably act in a different way if you take<br/>&gt; into<br/>&gt; &gt; account the &quot;traditional&quot; ways that chord inversions and such are<br/>&gt; viewed -<br/>&gt; &gt; and these ways were groundbreaking in their own time and evolved<br/>&gt; out of<br/>&gt; &gt; their own realizations.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; I.E.: the two approaches give differing results, and thus something<br/>&gt; in the<br/>&gt; &gt; overall theory is inconsistent. All known musical truths will never<br/>&gt; be<br/>&gt; &gt; accessible through any axiomatic system - but it might be useful to<br/>&gt; at least<br/>&gt; &gt; make the current one consistent. As I see it (and I feel this is a<br/>&gt; fairly<br/>&gt; &gt; common perspective), the way many of us have been taught music<br/>&gt; theory in<br/>&gt; &gt; school fails to explain microtonal theory (see above for the b9<br/>&gt; example),<br/>&gt; &gt; and the way many of us currently see microtonal theory fails to<br/>&gt; explain good<br/>&gt; &gt; ol&apos; fashioned 12tet music theory from school (the areas in which it<br/>&gt; DOES<br/>&gt; &gt; work). If these two could be reconciled, I think it would be good.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; So to restate the question:<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; Why do we sometimes hear intervals &quot;guided&quot; to their nearest match<br/>&gt; in a<br/>&gt; &gt; harmonic series, and why do we sometimes hear them as new entities<br/>&gt; in their<br/>&gt; &gt; own right with different feelings and characters to them?<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; Or, in a more general sense, what causes someone to hear a certain<br/>&gt; interval<br/>&gt; &gt; as a mistuned form of another interval?<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; OR, in its *broadest* sense, what causes someone, when experiencing<br/>&gt; a<br/>&gt; &gt; phenomenon, to view that phenomenon as an altered version of another<br/>&gt; &gt; phenomenon?<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; Sometimes we get into &quot;well the brain does this&quot; or &quot;the brain does<br/>&gt; that,&quot;<br/>&gt; &gt; and I think those answers often fall short of the truth.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; -Mike<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;</p></div><h3>Graham Breed &#x3C;gbreed@...&#x3E;</h3><span>6/11/2008 1:22:55 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Mike Battaglia wrote:</p><p>&gt; Yeah!

In a 5-limit context there&apos;s only one<br/>&gt; interpretation.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt; can both blur the seventh partial while at the same time perhaps &gt; be on<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt; the edge of hearing as &quot;Just&quot;. These tasty and functional &quot;blurred&quot;<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt; regions I call &quot;shadows&quot;- 23/18 is an example, another kind &gt; would be<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt; found at a 25/24 above 5/4, which works as a kind of bright &gt; 13/10 (&lt;<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt; 2.8 cents high) and is obviously nicely linked to 5/4 for smooth<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt; rides in and out of shadow and light.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; Yeah, this is sort of related to the original question I was &gt; asking...<br/>&gt; &gt; Is it that the 12tet major third approximates 5/4 but is really &gt; sharp,<br/>&gt; &gt; or is it that it approximates a higher-prime interval, or is it that<br/>&gt; &gt; the higher-prime interval itself approximates the lower-prime<br/>&gt; &gt; interval? Perhaps moving 5/4 up slightly by some irrational &gt; number and<br/>&gt; &gt; ignoring JI altogether would work as well.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; And this is the point where I say it doesn&apos;t matter at all.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; Another example of what you&apos;re talking about here I think is the &gt; good<br/>&gt; &gt; ol&apos; neutral triad... I have a multistable perception of neutral &gt; triad<br/>&gt; &gt; as an out of tune major and an out of tune minor simultaneously. I<br/>&gt; &gt; suspect that the more I listen to it the more I will get used to &gt; it as<br/>&gt; &gt; a stable chord in its own right, and then that interval will develop<br/>&gt; &gt; its own &quot;field of attraction&quot; apart from the major and the minor &gt; one.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Discordance graphs tend to show a kind of plateau between<br/>&gt; major and minor thirds. So any third will do. Whether<br/>&gt; that&apos;s because 6:5 and 5:4 merge into each other or because<br/>&gt; they merge in with 11:9 and 16:13 doesn&apos;t matter at all.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; I suspect that fields of attraction are not drawn around actual<br/>&gt; &gt; harmonic intervals, but around the MEMORIES we have of intervals. It<br/>&gt; &gt; has to do with a tendency<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; A meaningful question is: do intervals like 11:9 represent<br/>&gt; minimum points of dissonance? This is the concept of<br/>&gt; &quot;tunable intervals&quot;. If intervals sound more consonant the<br/>&gt; closer they get to some ideal, it&apos;s worth considering that<br/>&gt; ideal when you choose a tuning or notation.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; A teacher at my school was talking about the spectralists. I still<br/>&gt; &gt; haven&apos;t heard any really good examples though. I searched for &gt; &quot;Scelsi&quot;<br/>&gt; &gt; on Youtube and didn&apos;t find much,<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; There was a programme on the BBC a while back which I have<br/>&gt; on Mini Disc -- but not with me.

I would call it an empirical method over a rational<br/>&gt;one.<br/>&gt; Something that has occupied my thoughts quite a bit lately. I guess<br/>&gt;the<br/>&gt; next question is how one uses them, only for certain things or<br/>&gt; combinations?</p><p>Definitely empirical first and foremost. For example, when I went<br/>listening for a most &quot;thorth&quot; or &quot;foird&quot; interval between 5/4 and<br/>4/3, I just kept poking at it by singing and playing the Theremin<br/>over a drone, and found that it was &quot;a hair above 13/10.&quot;  Then<br/>because 13/10 is a superparticular interval (these are the smoothest<br/>and easiest in the long term to jam along with, as far as I can tell)<br/>above 5/4, (26/25), I figured what the hell why not try a 25/24 above<br/>5/4, which is just the relation between 6/5 and 5/4 shifted up and<br/>results in the &quot;classical augmented third&quot;. With such a &quot;natural&quot;<br/>step I can slide in and out of light and shadow both melodically and<br/>harmonically.</p><p>The classic augmented third sounded damn near perfect- singing and<br/>playing the Theremin it doesn&apos;t matter a bit, don&apos;t even have to<br/>&quot;know&quot;, but using synthesizers you have to tell them exactly what to<br/>play.</p><p>Then much later I measured a &quot;phi-th&quot; of the distance between 5/4 and<br/>4/3, that is, the golden proportion on the frequency level, and find<br/>that the &quot;noble&quot; interval as propounded by Dave and Margot is less<br/>than &lt;.78 cents higher than my best-guess &quot;foird&quot; figure for tuning<br/>tables.</p><p>Hmmm.... I&apos;ll put a record of the process into Scala...</p><p>0:........1/1............0.000.....unison, perfect prime<br/>1:........5/4............386.314...major third<br/>2:........13/10..........454.214...tridecimal semi-diminished fourth<br/>3:........456.214 cents..456.214...zlati rez 5/4 + 4/3<br/>4:........125/96.........456.986...classic augmented third<br/>5:........4/3............498.045...perfect four</p><p>&gt;Kinda an if /then structure i could see working<br/>&gt;itself<br/>&gt; into it as opposed to some rational configuration, such as hexanies<br/>made<br/>&gt; of these etc. While you might it seems like your process of<br/>&gt;choosing<br/>&gt; might find such things as the result as opposed to the means. I am<br/>&gt; fishing which i hope you don&apos;t mind.</p><p>It seems that it&apos;s all interlocked pretty sweetly, like the &quot;thirth&quot;<br/>being 25/24 from 5/4- there&apos;s a noble minor third damn near exactly<br/>5/6 down from the square root of two, another golden cut interval<br/>23/24 of 3/2 (aka 9/8 above 23/18), etc. etc.</p><p> &gt;<br/>&gt; anyway it was what i like of Wilson tunings in Xen. 3 where one<br/>&gt;will<br/>&gt; have different configurations on different places on the keyboard<br/>&gt;or<br/>&gt; overall tuning. Pythagorean then 5 limit then 7. He is deliberately<br/>&gt; conservative in his approach but would never object to what you are<br/>&gt; doing here.</p><p>I bet there are very regular chains involved, for everything I&apos;ve<br/>found so far can be found within two cents by wandering with simple<br/>rational steps through different paths, taking different turns. For<br/>example, whether you drop a 7/8 then a 10/13 from 7/4, or drop a<br/>noble high &quot;foird&quot; (which in turn can be divided into 5/4 and 25/24)<br/>from the golden cut of 7/5 and 7/4, you wind up either way at the<br/>noble minor third, the discrepancy is less than one cent iirc.</p><p>It could very well be that it&apos;s simply a matter of using certain<br/>points, where different kinds of harmonic series converge, as portals<br/>between different series. And I don&apos;t think it&apos;s just the phi<br/>intervals that do this, or at least, there are other ways to define<br/>the shadowy points: the harmonic entropy charts I&apos;ve seen have some<br/>of them, or extremely close, and I&apos;ve found some of the same (within<br/>1 cent cent) intervals with bonehead simple divisions of Pi; 3/2Pi<br/>also leads to the noble minor third Dave and Margot wrote about, and<br/>that&apos;s the one I was using before I found out about their work in<br/>this area.</p><p>Sorry to go on, kinda thinking out loud and finding excuses not to be<br/>making drum beats by a deadline.</p><p>Just one more thing- after toiling for so long by ear to have found<br/>some half dozen specific shadow regions just a couple of cents wide,<br/>and then discovering that they can be described so exactly in such<br/>simple ways, I will simply chortle at any accusations of numerology.<br/>Not that there is anything wrong with numerology.</p><p>-Cameron Bobro</p><p>PS. In the unlikely event that any harmonic entropy fans have read<br/>this far, about that 656 cent HE point: there&apos;s a shadow at 628 cents<br/>(turns out to be a noble interval) and one about 670 cents (no<br/>explanation for this one other than it&apos;s a 5/4 above the noble minor<br/>third, so it may be a shadow of a shadow, as Jacques Brel would say)<br/>but the 656 cent HE thing is a thing of its own, and a good one at<br/>that, to my ears. It&apos;s very close to a 5/4 on 7/6. I would like to<br/>know a more finely described figure for that particular HE point,<br/>because if you drop it just half a cent or so (not to 5/4 above 7/6<br/>which is sour), it&apos;s a winner.</p></div><h3>Cameron Bobro &#x3C;misterbobro@...&#x3E;</h3><span>6/11/2008 5:56:59 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Say Mike have you read Terhardt?

Obviously this is kind of a given in musical<br/>&gt; &gt; performance, so more specifically, the character of intervals in<br/>the<br/>&gt; &gt; context of the tuning.<br/>&gt; &gt; Be forewarned that Carl has called my ideas &quot;eye of newt&quot; :-D<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; He does tend to do that, doesn&apos;t he?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; but here goes: every interval has a character and in a tuning<br/>that hangs<br/>&gt; &gt; together, or in which all seems &quot;of a kind&quot; or &quot;from the same<br/>&gt; &gt; pallete&quot;, the intervals share certain color/feeling<br/>characteristics.<br/>&gt; &gt; So I listen for &quot;character families&quot;. An obvious one is like the<br/>&gt; &gt; slightly upwardly detuned 5/4 you mentioned before- it&apos;s a little<br/>&gt; &gt; brighter. If you take for example 34-equal, there are genuine<br/>&gt; &gt; approximations of 6/5 and 5/4; at two cents away it would be<br/>kooky to<br/>&gt; &gt; pretend that there isn&apos;t an obvious relation between the m3 and<br/>M3 of<br/>&gt; &gt; 34-equal, and those of the harmonic partials. They&apos;re the &quot;same&quot;<br/>on<br/>&gt; &gt; one hand, but both are two cents higher and brighter in character<br/>on<br/>&gt; &gt; the other. Throw in the even brighter 34-equal &quot;3/2&quot; and you&apos;ve<br/>got<br/>&gt; &gt; a very clear character family right there in the first six<br/>partials:<br/>&gt; &gt; bright and brassy.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Yeah! That&apos;s always what attracted me to 17-tet, the wider fifths. I<br/>&gt; think it usually sounds good because widening them slightly<br/>&gt; accentuates the intervals that we&apos;re already used to. I also<br/>&gt; hypothesize that it might be because of some resemblance to the<br/>&gt; stretched harmonic series that we often hear in nature (although it<br/>&gt; could just be my own bias). This is why I always liked 12-tet more<br/>&gt; than 19-tet - the third and fifth (and harmonic 7th) are all flat in<br/>&gt; 19-tet, so everything sounds compressed and less accentuated. It<br/>&gt; sounds like my brain is getting compressed. Although, the more I<br/>&gt; listen to 19-tet, the more I like it, so it may just be my own bias<br/>&gt; towards wider intervals that is being expressed here.</p><p>17 is a subset of 34 of course. 34 and 68 are the closest things to<br/>alternating light and shadow, in my view, of any of the equal<br/>divisions, and they&apos;re what I use for notation.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I suppose some cross-culture listening tests would have to be<br/>&gt; performed in order to determine whether that theory is due to a<br/>&gt; cultural bias for wider intervals (e.g. the 12tet major third) or<br/>&gt; whether it has some acoustic basis. Honestly I think that the<br/>apparent<br/>&gt; duality here can be resolved by noting that while there is likely<br/>SOME<br/>&gt; acoustic basis on what you initially hear, the matter of whether you<br/>&gt; LIKE what your brain shows you after all of this acoustic and<br/>&gt; psychoacoustic stuff goes down is a different mental process<br/>entirely.<br/>&gt; And then what you like or prefer makes up part of your overall<br/>&gt; perception, or Gestalt.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; Looking at things this way, it&apos;s easy to imagine that a whole<br/>tuning<br/>&gt; &gt; can have a certain character, or &quot;red thread&quot;. I call it an<br/>&gt; &gt; uebertimbre to irk Carl, but in seriousness it&apos;s a<br/>Gesamtklangfarbe.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Hahaha what? Gezundheit<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; When you have intervals, whether rational or &quot;irrational&quot;, that<br/>&gt; &gt; create coincident or near-concident partials with great<br/>regularity,<br/>&gt; &gt; you tend to put weight in specific places in the spectra. If you<br/>plot<br/>&gt; &gt; the partials of say a complete &quot;7-limit&quot; u- and o-tonality<br/>tuning, it<br/>&gt; &gt; is not hard to imagine that the regions coinciding with seventh<br/>&gt; &gt; partials tend to get reinforced in a piece of music. As you can<br/>&gt; &gt; easily demonstrate with an additive synthesizer, putting more<br/>energy<br/>&gt; &gt; into the seventh partial makes for a different tone color.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I remember hearing an example on the web of a JI major chord as<br/>&gt; compared to the 12tet major chord. The website claimed that the<br/>equal<br/>&gt; tempered one sounded better, and for their example, it did. Then<br/>they<br/>&gt; had a JI major chord in which the notes were phase shifted so that I<br/>&gt; think the 5th harmonic of the fundamental cancelled out with the 4th<br/>&gt; harmonic of the major third, and it sounded much better, though I&apos;m<br/>&gt; not sure why that particular overtone was so offensive.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; Obviously a tuning in and of itself isn&apos;t enough to really have a<br/>&gt; &gt; Gesamtklangfarbe, it&apos;s really a potential Gesamtklangfarbe because<br/>&gt; &gt; key and modality also write the overall timbre- for example, a<br/>&gt; &gt; secondary key center or an insistent figure can create a kind of<br/>&gt; &gt; &quot;formant&quot; in the overall spectral envelope of the piece.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Interesting ideas. I&apos;d like to hear some musical examples that<br/>&gt;utilize<br/>&gt; this for some interesting effect. Apparently gesamtklangfarbe<br/>&gt; translates to &quot;total tone quality,&quot; which is a term I&apos;ve never heard<br/>&gt; before.</p><p>Probably you&apos;ll find it most in music criticism or descriptions of<br/>music, but I think it&apos;s the best word in this context. Not as funny<br/>as &quot;uebertimbre&quot; though.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; (Really wide voicings and punctalism would probably throw the<br/>&gt;whole<br/>&gt; &gt; thing to the dogs, but that is nothing new, these things have been<br/>&gt; &gt; effective tools of &quot;atonalists&quot; for a long time.)<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; It would be awesome if there was some software that let you screw<br/>&gt; around with JI chords and inharmonicity as such. Would most likely<br/>&gt;be<br/>&gt; interesting in the end.</p><p>Csound, man!</p><p>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; Another thing that is common in distinctive and attractive<br/>instrument<br/>&gt; &gt; timbres is gaps-and-lumps in the partials, analize a violin sound<br/>for<br/>&gt; &gt; example. In my experience, gaps-and-lumps in the overall field of<br/>&gt; &gt; coincident partials that a tuning tends to reinforce is a good<br/>thing.<br/>&gt; &gt; So after long poking around with my ears at tuning until it<br/>floats my<br/>&gt; &gt; boat, I (always?) find upon examination that has characteristics<br/>like<br/>&gt; &gt; &quot;primes: 2,3,5,23&quot; or &quot;2,5,7,73&quot; and so on.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Interesting. Probably due to resonant effects of the body or<br/>&gt;something.</p><p>Those are responsible for formants as well. There are other things-<br/>ever notice that a clarinet is an octave lower than it looks like?<br/>Same thing that makes it so makes for the every-other nature of the<br/>partials. (somebody is going to cringe at that but you have to admit<br/>it&apos;s basically true and a decent poetic reference to the differences<br/>between open/closed tapered/straight bores)</p><p>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; Notice that &quot;73&quot; or any extremely high partial needs absolutely no<br/>&gt; &gt; numerology or wild claims of human hearing ability to be<br/>&quot;justified&quot;.<br/>&gt; &gt; 73/64 is four cents from 8/7 so we&apos;re hearing something which is<br/>&gt; &gt; both a thing of its own, and a flavor of 8/7.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Yeah. That&apos;s the key. That&apos;s why I had second thoughts about the<br/>&gt; assertions made above that a dominant 7 chord where the 7 is 16/9<br/>will<br/>&gt; be interpreted &quot;by the brain&quot; as being an out of tune 7/4. It&apos;s just<br/>&gt; that 7/4 and 16/9 are fairly close in the pitch continuum, so<br/>&gt; naturally they&apos;ll sound similar. The whole thing seems to ignore the<br/>&gt; fact that these intervals have characters of their own as well; they<br/>&gt; are not merely mistuned versions of other simpler intervals,<br/>although<br/>&gt; you might hear them that way at first. You might also hear the<br/>simpler<br/>&gt; intervals as mistunings of the more complicated ones, which is why<br/>&gt; when people used to 12-tet hear music in just intonation for the<br/>first<br/>&gt; time sometimes think it &quot;sounds wrong,&quot; even if there is no commatic<br/>&gt; drift or the like.</p><p>In music that has conjunct tetrachords as structual elements it&apos;s the<br/>16/9 that&apos;s likely going to be &quot;more Just&quot;, not the 7/4.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I think these fields of attraction are merely a way to describe the<br/>&gt; phenomenon of how and under what circumstances we hear a resemblance<br/>&gt; to the harmonic series in tempered or non-harmonic (or upper JI<br/>&gt; harmonic) intervals.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; It&apos;s like this image: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/</a><br/>Image:Invariance.jpg<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &quot;A&quot; is the original object, and &quot;D&quot; is a distorted version of the<br/>same<br/>&gt; object. The concept of a field of attraction is merely I think is an<br/>&gt; attempt to explain how much of that distortion we can take before we<br/>&gt; stop seeing it as the same object. However, saying that the images<br/>in<br/>&gt; D are ONLY good at being &quot;slightly erroneous&quot; versions of the<br/>objects<br/>&gt; in picture A is taking it too far. After all, no axiomatic theory is<br/>&gt; complete (hint, hint).<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I think a more accurate approach is that a person might interpret<br/>16/9<br/>&gt; as an out-of-tune 7/4 if they are used to hearing 7/4 and not at all<br/>&gt; to hearing 16/9. They might then become used to 16/9 as a separate<br/>&gt; interval in its own right later. This is why I am wary of labeling<br/>one<br/>&gt; particular person&apos;s response to an interval or chord as though it<br/>were<br/>&gt; something the &quot;brain&quot; does. One person&apos;s brain might exhibit a<br/>certain<br/>&gt; behavior as the neurological correlate of a psychological<br/>&gt; interpretation, but then attempting to generalize that behavior to<br/>&gt; -all- people falls prey to the same fallacy that is currently<br/>ruining<br/>&gt; how music theory is being taught in America.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Here&apos;s a simple example to demonstrate that concept... Play a 12 bar<br/>&gt; blues, where the chords are 4:5:6:7. Let&apos;s say it&apos;s in the key of C.<br/>&gt; Right before the C goes to F, change the 7th of the C chord to be<br/>&gt; 16/9, as in change it from an otonal tetrad to a pythagorean<br/>&gt; &quot;dominant&quot; 7, that resolves as a V-I to the next chord. see if you<br/>&gt; feel a difference!<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Another way to say all of this is that you perhaps DEVELOP your<br/>fields<br/>&gt; of attraction to intervals over time, depending on when you hear<br/>them.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; Other high partials<br/>&gt; &gt; are great for blurring other regions- 23/18 for example splits the<br/>&gt; &gt; difference between 9/7 and 14/11, and a &quot;23&quot; tuning (o&apos;s and u&apos;s<br/>to<br/>&gt; &gt; use Partch&apos;s charmingly ridiculous but effective terminology)<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I never really understood the otonality and utonality thing... It<br/>&gt; makes sense at first but breaks down the further you get into it. A<br/>&gt; minor chord is both a utonality and an otonality, depending on how<br/>you<br/>&gt; look at it. So is a major chord.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; can both blur the seventh partial while at the same time perhaps<br/>be on<br/>&gt; &gt; the edge of hearing as &quot;Just&quot;. These tasty and functional<br/>&quot;blurred&quot;<br/>&gt; &gt; regions I call &quot;shadows&quot;- 23/18 is an example, another kind would<br/>be<br/>&gt; &gt; found at a 25/24 above 5/4, which works as a kind of bright 13/10<br/>(&lt;<br/>&gt; &gt; 2.8 cents high) and is obviously nicely linked to 5/4 for smooth<br/>&gt; &gt; rides in and out of shadow and light.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Yeah, this is sort of related to the original question I was<br/>asking...<br/>&gt; Is it that the 12tet major third approximates 5/4 but is really<br/>sharp,<br/>&gt; or is it that it approximates a higher-prime interval, or is it that<br/>&gt; the higher-prime interval itself approximates the lower-prime<br/>&gt; interval? Perhaps moving 5/4 up slightly by some irrational number<br/>and<br/>&gt; ignoring JI altogether would work as well.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Another example of what you&apos;re talking about here I think is the<br/>good<br/>&gt; ol&apos; neutral triad... I have a multistable perception of neutral<br/>triad<br/>&gt; as an out of tune major and an out of tune minor simultaneously. I<br/>&gt; suspect that the more I listen to it the more I will get used to it<br/>as<br/>&gt; a stable chord in its own right, and then that interval will develop<br/>&gt; its own &quot;field of attraction&quot; apart from the major and the minor<br/>one.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I suspect that fields of attraction are not drawn around actual<br/>&gt; harmonic intervals, but around the MEMORIES we have of intervals. It<br/>&gt; has to do with a tendency</p><p>I think that Terhardt is right in viewing things as a whole- what is<br/>exerting gravity (hehe) changes in context.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; I would think that this all sounds quite tame and maybe even<br/>common-<br/>&gt; &gt; sensical. The other day I read about the &quot;spectralists&quot; here (BTW<br/>&gt; &gt; thanks for the information and links, guys!), a school I wasn&apos;t<br/>aware<br/>&gt; &gt; of. As far as I can make out a lot of what I do is about the<br/>same, at<br/>&gt; &gt; heart, only backwards. No big deal.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; A teacher at my school was talking about the spectralists. I still<br/>&gt; haven&apos;t heard any really good examples though. I searched for<br/>&quot;Scelsi&quot;<br/>&gt; on Youtube and didn&apos;t find much,<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; But if you think about it, you will realize how easily this can<br/>come<br/>&gt; &gt; into conflict with the regular temperament paradigm. (I am not<br/>&gt; &gt; putting &quot;regular temperament paradigm&quot; in quotes because I think<br/>it&apos;s<br/>&gt; &gt; a serious thing and the guys here involved in defining it should<br/>be<br/>&gt; &gt; proud of,not embarrassed by, the expression.)<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I have been reading the regular temperament paradigm and find it<br/>very<br/>&gt; interesting. There are cases where it seems brilliantly insightful<br/>and<br/>&gt; others where it just seems like one particular way of looking at<br/>&gt; certain aspects of harmony and temperament.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I am starting to become concerned with the &quot;why&quot;&apos;s rather than the<br/>&gt; &quot;how&quot;&apos;s... I think one gestalt-related approach might be to state<br/>that<br/>&gt; if we hear a 12-tet C C G C E G chord, we are likely to hear the<br/>&gt; resemblance to the harmonic series and thus hear it that way.<br/>However,<br/>&gt; people often hear that 12-tet major third as having its own sound,<br/>&gt; sticking out and being much brighter than a just 5/4. Sometimes that<br/>&gt; 12-tet major third sticks out and implies a harmony and tonality of<br/>&gt; its own completely separate from the major third.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; The paradigm where everything is completely heard in terms of being<br/>&gt; out of tune simple integer just intonation relationships I think is<br/>&gt;a<br/>&gt; good rough start, but ultimately incomplete and inconsistent.</p><p>&gt;It&apos;s<br/>&gt;an<br/>&gt; attempt to describe the resemblance we hear between various tempered<br/>&gt; intervals and other intervals in the harmonic series. This<br/>resemblance<br/>&gt; is often used in equal tempered music to -imply- the existence of a<br/>&gt; faux-harmonic series for musical purposes. Different just-intonated<br/>&gt; intervals can also be used to imply the harmonic series as well, in<br/>&gt; that sense. However, dismissing these intervals as serving -only-<br/>&gt;that<br/>&gt; functionality is a non-sequitur.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; In other words, this view goes wrong when it ignores the -<br/>difference-<br/>&gt; between the harmonic series versions and the tempered versions.<br/>&gt; Usually this difference is dismissed as being an &quot;error,&quot; the<br/>&gt; implication being that it is undesirable. Yet, as we&apos;ve seen with<br/>&gt; 12-tet and 34-tet, this difference is often musical in character and<br/>&gt; not at all &quot;erroneous.&quot;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;  Not only for atonal music, which often draws from a disregarding of<br/>&gt; harmony entirely, but for tonal music as well. The most obvious<br/>place<br/>&gt; where the system breaks down that I&apos;ve seen in recent memory is the<br/>&gt; Wikipedia entry for &quot;41 equal temperament.&quot;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Take this sentence near the bottom:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &quot;41-ET also has 6 distinct intervals between a perfect fourth and<br/>&gt; perfect fifth, whereas 31-ET has only four; the two additional<br/>&gt; intervals are poor matches to the ratios 15:11 and 22:15.&quot;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; It seems to be a common trend among these circles to hear one<br/>interval<br/>&gt; as a &quot;poor match&quot; to another one. Seems like a matter of not being<br/>&gt; used enough to that interval to hear it for what it is. 10 cent<br/>&gt; differences in pitch can make quite a difference; we aren&apos;t talking<br/>&gt; about a 3 cent distinction here.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; It&apos;s like taking the triangle from letter A in this image<br/>&gt; (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Image:Reification.jpg">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Image:Reification.jpg</a>) and saying<br/>it&apos;s a<br/>&gt; &quot;poor&quot; match to a triangle because the sides are incomplete.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; Right off the bat, it is clear that if there&apos;s any legitamcy to<br/>this approach, reckoning<br/>&gt; &gt; &quot;errors&quot; in temperaments would be a very big pain in the ass, for<br/>a<br/>&gt; &gt; greater &quot;error&quot; (deviation from Just) in an interval could very<br/>well<br/>&gt; &gt; mean more, and not less, continuity in &quot;flavor&quot; or &quot;hue&quot; or<br/>whatever.<br/>&gt; &gt; And &quot;shadows&quot;, or zones of ambiguity, rely on NOT being good<br/>&gt; &gt; approximations of intervals, but on being in the (right) wrong<br/>place<br/>&gt; &gt; in the audible spectrum.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Agreed. No newts found here.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; Add to this the probability that it&apos;s the gapped-and-lumped<br/>spectra<br/>&gt; &gt; that make for the nicest<br/>&gt; &gt; &quot;Gesamtflangfarben&quot;, and we&apos;re looking at &quot;good&quot; temperaments that<br/>&gt; &gt; might appear on paper to be pretty crappy. As you have certainly<br/>&gt; &gt; noticed, 12-tET, all questions of taste aside, is might flexible,<br/>and<br/>&gt; &gt; it fits the kind of description I gave above: &quot;damn near perfect 2<br/>&gt; &gt; and 3, and some 19&quot; The 19 is not the &quot;justification&quot; of 12-tET,<br/>&gt; &gt; though who knows if there&apos;s some far-away feeling of it or not-<br/>&gt; &gt; doesn&apos;t matter. &quot;19&quot; just a rough description of the place the<br/>&gt; &gt; &quot;shadows&quot; of 12-tET dwell. In the case of 12-tET, it&apos;s the size<br/>and<br/>&gt; &gt; vagueness of the shadow zones that make it flexible, but when 12-<br/>tET<br/>&gt; &gt; is taken literally they&apos;re just too damn big and blurry IMO.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Don&apos;t understand this paragraph.. What do you mean, the 19th<br/>harmonic?</p><p>&gt; What do you mean by justification? Could you elaborate?<br/>-Mike<br/>&gt;</p><p>By justification, I mean you could say that the m3 and M3 of 12-tET<br/>are approximating 19/16 and 19/15, which they approximate better on<br/>paper than they do 6/5 and 5/4. Maybe that&apos;s audible or not, doesn&apos;t<br/>really matter- what they do do is nicely fail to approximate all<br/>kinds of intervals, remaining vague enough to be interpreted as all<br/>kinds of things in practice. Autotune, by enforcing 12-tET, is going<br/>to kill it dead because it robs 12-tET of this, its one true power<br/>aside from the exactness of the first coupla perfect intervals. The<br/>19 approximations are just rough descriptions of where the &quot;fuzz&quot;<br/>lies. If they do impart some lessening of dissonance, so much the<br/>better, whatever, but we&apos;re dealing with &quot;fuzzies&quot;, not<br/>&quot;approximations&quot; in 12-tET, as far as thirds and sixths.</p></div><h3>Cameron Bobro &#x3C;misterbobro@...&#x3E;</h3><span>6/11/2008 6:32:10 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, Kraig Grady &lt;kraiggrady@...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; i think 23 is used in cadences allot. 17 Helmholtz pointed out.<br/>&gt;     As maybe the person who works the most with sequences that lead<br/>&gt;to<br/>&gt; noble numbers i can say a few words about them.

Obviously this is kind of a given in musical<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; performance, so more specifically, the character of intervals in<br/>&gt; the<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; context of the tuning.<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; Be forewarned that Carl has called my ideas &quot;eye of newt&quot; :-D<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; He does tend to do that, doesn&apos;t he?<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; but here goes: every interval has a character and in a tuning<br/>&gt; that hangs<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; together, or in which all seems &quot;of a kind&quot; or &quot;from the same<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; pallete&quot;, the intervals share certain color/feeling<br/>&gt; characteristics.<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; So I listen for &quot;character families&quot;. An obvious one is like the<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; slightly upwardly detuned 5/4 you mentioned before- it&apos;s a little<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; brighter. If you take for example 34-equal, there are genuine<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; approximations of 6/5 and 5/4; at two cents away it would be<br/>&gt; kooky to<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; pretend that there isn&apos;t an obvious relation between the m3 and<br/>&gt; M3 of<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; 34-equal, and those of the harmonic partials. They&apos;re the &quot;same&quot;<br/>&gt; on<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; one hand, but both are two cents higher and brighter in character<br/>&gt; on<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; the other. Throw in the even brighter 34-equal &quot;3/2&quot; and you&apos;ve<br/>&gt; got<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; a very clear character family right there in the first six<br/>&gt; partials:<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; bright and brassy.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; Yeah! That&apos;s always what attracted me to 17-tet, the wider fifths. I<br/>&gt; &gt; think it usually sounds good because widening them slightly<br/>&gt; &gt; accentuates the intervals that we&apos;re already used to. I also<br/>&gt; &gt; hypothesize that it might be because of some resemblance to the<br/>&gt; &gt; stretched harmonic series that we often hear in nature (although it<br/>&gt; &gt; could just be my own bias). This is why I always liked 12-tet more<br/>&gt; &gt; than 19-tet - the third and fifth (and harmonic 7th) are all flat in<br/>&gt; &gt; 19-tet, so everything sounds compressed and less accentuated. It<br/>&gt; &gt; sounds like my brain is getting compressed. Although, the more I<br/>&gt; &gt; listen to 19-tet, the more I like it, so it may just be my own bias<br/>&gt; &gt; towards wider intervals that is being expressed here.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; 17 is a subset of 34 of course. 34 and 68 are the closest things to<br/>&gt; alternating light and shadow, in my view, of any of the equal<br/>&gt; divisions, and they&apos;re what I use for notation.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; I suppose some cross-culture listening tests would have to be<br/>&gt; &gt; performed in order to determine whether that theory is due to a<br/>&gt; &gt; cultural bias for wider intervals (e.g. the 12tet major third) or<br/>&gt; &gt; whether it has some acoustic basis. Honestly I think that the<br/>&gt; apparent<br/>&gt; &gt; duality here can be resolved by noting that while there is likely<br/>&gt; SOME<br/>&gt; &gt; acoustic basis on what you initially hear, the matter of whether you<br/>&gt; &gt; LIKE what your brain shows you after all of this acoustic and<br/>&gt; &gt; psychoacoustic stuff goes down is a different mental process<br/>&gt; entirely.<br/>&gt; &gt; And then what you like or prefer makes up part of your overall<br/>&gt; &gt; perception, or Gestalt.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; Looking at things this way, it&apos;s easy to imagine that a whole<br/>&gt; tuning<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; can have a certain character, or &quot;red thread&quot;. I call it an<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; uebertimbre to irk Carl, but in seriousness it&apos;s a<br/>&gt; Gesamtklangfarbe.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; Hahaha what? Gezundheit<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; When you have intervals, whether rational or &quot;irrational&quot;, that<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; create coincident or near-concident partials with great<br/>&gt; regularity,<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; you tend to put weight in specific places in the spectra. If you<br/>&gt; plot<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; the partials of say a complete &quot;7-limit&quot; u- and o-tonality<br/>&gt; tuning, it<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; is not hard to imagine that the regions coinciding with seventh<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; partials tend to get reinforced in a piece of music. As you can<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; easily demonstrate with an additive synthesizer, putting more<br/>&gt; energy<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; into the seventh partial makes for a different tone color.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; I remember hearing an example on the web of a JI major chord as<br/>&gt; &gt; compared to the 12tet major chord. The website claimed that the<br/>&gt; equal<br/>&gt; &gt; tempered one sounded better, and for their example, it did. Then<br/>&gt; they<br/>&gt; &gt; had a JI major chord in which the notes were phase shifted so that I<br/>&gt; &gt; think the 5th harmonic of the fundamental cancelled out with the 4th<br/>&gt; &gt; harmonic of the major third, and it sounded much better, though I&apos;m<br/>&gt; &gt; not sure why that particular overtone was so offensive.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; Obviously a tuning in and of itself isn&apos;t enough to really have a<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; Gesamtklangfarbe, it&apos;s really a potential Gesamtklangfarbe because<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; key and modality also write the overall timbre- for example, a<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; secondary key center or an insistent figure can create a kind of<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &quot;formant&quot; in the overall spectral envelope of the piece.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; Interesting ideas. I&apos;d like to hear some musical examples that<br/>&gt; &gt;utilize<br/>&gt; &gt; this for some interesting effect. Apparently gesamtklangfarbe<br/>&gt; &gt; translates to &quot;total tone quality,&quot; which is a term I&apos;ve never heard<br/>&gt; &gt; before.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Probably you&apos;ll find it most in music criticism or descriptions of<br/>&gt; music, but I think it&apos;s the best word in this context. Not as funny<br/>&gt; as &quot;uebertimbre&quot; though.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; (Really wide voicings and punctalism would probably throw the<br/>&gt; &gt;whole<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; thing to the dogs, but that is nothing new, these things have been<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; effective tools of &quot;atonalists&quot; for a long time.)<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; It would be awesome if there was some software that let you screw<br/>&gt; &gt; around with JI chords and inharmonicity as such. Would most likely<br/>&gt; &gt;be<br/>&gt; &gt; interesting in the end.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Csound, man!<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; Another thing that is common in distinctive and attractive<br/>&gt; instrument<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; timbres is gaps-and-lumps in the partials, analize a violin sound<br/>&gt; for<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; example. In my experience, gaps-and-lumps in the overall field of<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; coincident partials that a tuning tends to reinforce is a good<br/>&gt; thing.<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; So after long poking around with my ears at tuning until it<br/>&gt; floats my<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; boat, I (always?) find upon examination that has characteristics<br/>&gt; like<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &quot;primes: 2,3,5,23&quot; or &quot;2,5,7,73&quot; and so on.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; Interesting. Probably due to resonant effects of the body or<br/>&gt; &gt;something.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Those are responsible for formants as well. There are other things-<br/>&gt; ever notice that a clarinet is an octave lower than it looks like?<br/>&gt; Same thing that makes it so makes for the every-other nature of the<br/>&gt; partials. (somebody is going to cringe at that but you have to admit<br/>&gt; it&apos;s basically true and a decent poetic reference to the differences<br/>&gt; between open/closed tapered/straight bores)<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; Notice that &quot;73&quot; or any extremely high partial needs absolutely no<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; numerology or wild claims of human hearing ability to be<br/>&gt; &quot;justified&quot;.<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; 73/64 is four cents from 8/7 so we&apos;re hearing something which is<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; both a thing of its own, and a flavor of 8/7.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; Yeah. That&apos;s the key. That&apos;s why I had second thoughts about the<br/>&gt; &gt; assertions made above that a dominant 7 chord where the 7 is 16/9<br/>&gt; will<br/>&gt; &gt; be interpreted &quot;by the brain&quot; as being an out of tune 7/4. It&apos;s just<br/>&gt; &gt; that 7/4 and 16/9 are fairly close in the pitch continuum, so<br/>&gt; &gt; naturally they&apos;ll sound similar. The whole thing seems to ignore the<br/>&gt; &gt; fact that these intervals have characters of their own as well; they<br/>&gt; &gt; are not merely mistuned versions of other simpler intervals,<br/>&gt; although<br/>&gt; &gt; you might hear them that way at first. You might also hear the<br/>&gt; simpler<br/>&gt; &gt; intervals as mistunings of the more complicated ones, which is why<br/>&gt; &gt; when people used to 12-tet hear music in just intonation for the<br/>&gt; first<br/>&gt; &gt; time sometimes think it &quot;sounds wrong,&quot; even if there is no commatic<br/>&gt; &gt; drift or the like.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; In music that has conjunct tetrachords as structual elements it&apos;s the<br/>&gt; 16/9 that&apos;s likely going to be &quot;more Just&quot;, not the 7/4.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; I think these fields of attraction are merely a way to describe the<br/>&gt; &gt; phenomenon of how and under what circumstances we hear a resemblance<br/>&gt; &gt; to the harmonic series in tempered or non-harmonic (or upper JI<br/>&gt; &gt; harmonic) intervals.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; It&apos;s like this image: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/</a> &gt; &lt;<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/</a>&gt;<br/>&gt; Image:Invariance.jpg<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &quot;A&quot; is the original object, and &quot;D&quot; is a distorted version of the<br/>&gt; same<br/>&gt; &gt; object. The concept of a field of attraction is merely I think is an<br/>&gt; &gt; attempt to explain how much of that distortion we can take before we<br/>&gt; &gt; stop seeing it as the same object. However, saying that the images<br/>&gt; in<br/>&gt; &gt; D are ONLY good at being &quot;slightly erroneous&quot; versions of the<br/>&gt; objects<br/>&gt; &gt; in picture A is taking it too far. After all, no axiomatic theory is<br/>&gt; &gt; complete (hint, hint).<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; I think a more accurate approach is that a person might interpret<br/>&gt; 16/9<br/>&gt; &gt; as an out-of-tune 7/4 if they are used to hearing 7/4 and not at all<br/>&gt; &gt; to hearing 16/9. They might then become used to 16/9 as a separate<br/>&gt; &gt; interval in its own right later. This is why I am wary of labeling<br/>&gt; one<br/>&gt; &gt; particular person&apos;s response to an interval or chord as though it<br/>&gt; were<br/>&gt; &gt; something the &quot;brain&quot; does. One person&apos;s brain might exhibit a<br/>&gt; certain<br/>&gt; &gt; behavior as the neurological correlate of a psychological<br/>&gt; &gt; interpretation, but then attempting to generalize that behavior to<br/>&gt; &gt; -all- people falls prey to the same fallacy that is currently<br/>&gt; ruining<br/>&gt; &gt; how music theory is being taught in America.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; Here&apos;s a simple example to demonstrate that concept... Play a 12 bar<br/>&gt; &gt; blues, where the chords are 4:5:6:7. Let&apos;s say it&apos;s in the key of C.<br/>&gt; &gt; Right before the C goes to F, change the 7th of the C chord to be<br/>&gt; &gt; 16/9, as in change it from an otonal tetrad to a pythagorean<br/>&gt; &gt; &quot;dominant&quot; 7, that resolves as a V-I to the next chord. see if you<br/>&gt; &gt; feel a difference!<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; Another way to say all of this is that you perhaps DEVELOP your<br/>&gt; fields<br/>&gt; &gt; of attraction to intervals over time, depending on when you hear<br/>&gt; them.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; Other high partials<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; are great for blurring other regions- 23/18 for example splits the<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; difference between 9/7 and 14/11, and a &quot;23&quot; tuning (o&apos;s and u&apos;s<br/>&gt; to<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; use Partch&apos;s charmingly ridiculous but effective terminology)<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; I never really understood the otonality and utonality thing... It<br/>&gt; &gt; makes sense at first but breaks down the further you get into it. A<br/>&gt; &gt; minor chord is both a utonality and an otonality, depending on how<br/>&gt; you<br/>&gt; &gt; look at it. So is a major chord.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; can both blur the seventh partial while at the same time perhaps<br/>&gt; be on<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; the edge of hearing as &quot;Just&quot;. These tasty and functional<br/>&gt; &quot;blurred&quot;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; regions I call &quot;shadows&quot;- 23/18 is an example, another kind would<br/>&gt; be<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; found at a 25/24 above 5/4, which works as a kind of bright 13/10<br/>&gt; (&lt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; 2.8 cents high) and is obviously nicely linked to 5/4 for smooth<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; rides in and out of shadow and light.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; Yeah, this is sort of related to the original question I was<br/>&gt; asking...<br/>&gt; &gt; Is it that the 12tet major third approximates 5/4 but is really<br/>&gt; sharp,<br/>&gt; &gt; or is it that it approximates a higher-prime interval, or is it that<br/>&gt; &gt; the higher-prime interval itself approximates the lower-prime<br/>&gt; &gt; interval? Perhaps moving 5/4 up slightly by some irrational number<br/>&gt; and<br/>&gt; &gt; ignoring JI altogether would work as well.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; Another example of what you&apos;re talking about here I think is the<br/>&gt; good<br/>&gt; &gt; ol&apos; neutral triad... I have a multistable perception of neutral<br/>&gt; triad<br/>&gt; &gt; as an out of tune major and an out of tune minor simultaneously. I<br/>&gt; &gt; suspect that the more I listen to it the more I will get used to it<br/>&gt; as<br/>&gt; &gt; a stable chord in its own right, and then that interval will develop<br/>&gt; &gt; its own &quot;field of attraction&quot; apart from the major and the minor<br/>&gt; one.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; I suspect that fields of attraction are not drawn around actual<br/>&gt; &gt; harmonic intervals, but around the MEMORIES we have of intervals. It<br/>&gt; &gt; has to do with a tendency<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I think that Terhardt is right in viewing things as a whole- what is<br/>&gt; exerting gravity (hehe) changes in context.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; I would think that this all sounds quite tame and maybe even<br/>&gt; common-<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; sensical. The other day I read about the &quot;spectralists&quot; here (BTW<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; thanks for the information and links, guys!), a school I wasn&apos;t<br/>&gt; aware<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; of. As far as I can make out a lot of what I do is about the<br/>&gt; same, at<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; heart, only backwards. No big deal.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; A teacher at my school was talking about the spectralists. I still<br/>&gt; &gt; haven&apos;t heard any really good examples though. I searched for<br/>&gt; &quot;Scelsi&quot;<br/>&gt; &gt; on Youtube and didn&apos;t find much,<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; But if you think about it, you will realize how easily this can<br/>&gt; come<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; into conflict with the regular temperament paradigm. (I am not<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; putting &quot;regular temperament paradigm&quot; in quotes because I think<br/>&gt; it&apos;s<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; a serious thing and the guys here involved in defining it should<br/>&gt; be<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; proud of,not embarrassed by, the expression.)<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; I have been reading the regular temperament paradigm and find it<br/>&gt; very<br/>&gt; &gt; interesting. There are cases where it seems brilliantly insightful<br/>&gt; and<br/>&gt; &gt; others where it just seems like one particular way of looking at<br/>&gt; &gt; certain aspects of harmony and temperament.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; I am starting to become concerned with the &quot;why&quot;&apos;s rather than the<br/>&gt; &gt; &quot;how&quot;&apos;s... I think one gestalt-related approach might be to state<br/>&gt; that<br/>&gt; &gt; if we hear a 12-tet C C G C E G chord, we are likely to hear the<br/>&gt; &gt; resemblance to the harmonic series and thus hear it that way.<br/>&gt; However,<br/>&gt; &gt; people often hear that 12-tet major third as having its own sound,<br/>&gt; &gt; sticking out and being much brighter than a just 5/4. Sometimes that<br/>&gt; &gt; 12-tet major third sticks out and implies a harmony and tonality of<br/>&gt; &gt; its own completely separate from the major third.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; The paradigm where everything is completely heard in terms of being<br/>&gt; &gt; out of tune simple integer just intonation relationships I think is<br/>&gt; &gt;a<br/>&gt; &gt; good rough start, but ultimately incomplete and inconsistent.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;It&apos;s<br/>&gt; &gt;an<br/>&gt; &gt; attempt to describe the resemblance we hear between various tempered<br/>&gt; &gt; intervals and other intervals in the harmonic series. This<br/>&gt; resemblance<br/>&gt; &gt; is often used in equal tempered music to -imply- the existence of a<br/>&gt; &gt; faux-harmonic series for musical purposes. Different just-intonated<br/>&gt; &gt; intervals can also be used to imply the harmonic series as well, in<br/>&gt; &gt; that sense. However, dismissing these intervals as serving -only-<br/>&gt; &gt;that<br/>&gt; &gt; functionality is a non-sequitur.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; In other words, this view goes wrong when it ignores the -<br/>&gt; difference-<br/>&gt; &gt; between the harmonic series versions and the tempered versions.<br/>&gt; &gt; Usually this difference is dismissed as being an &quot;error,&quot; the<br/>&gt; &gt; implication being that it is undesirable. Yet, as we&apos;ve seen with<br/>&gt; &gt; 12-tet and 34-tet, this difference is often musical in character and<br/>&gt; &gt; not at all &quot;erroneous.&quot;<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; Not only for atonal music, which often draws from a disregarding of<br/>&gt; &gt; harmony entirely, but for tonal music as well. The most obvious<br/>&gt; place<br/>&gt; &gt; where the system breaks down that I&apos;ve seen in recent memory is the<br/>&gt; &gt; Wikipedia entry for &quot;41 equal temperament.&quot;<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; Take this sentence near the bottom:<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &quot;41-ET also has 6 distinct intervals between a perfect fourth and<br/>&gt; &gt; perfect fifth, whereas 31-ET has only four; the two additional<br/>&gt; &gt; intervals are poor matches to the ratios 15:11 and 22:15.&quot;<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; It seems to be a common trend among these circles to hear one<br/>&gt; interval<br/>&gt; &gt; as a &quot;poor match&quot; to another one. Seems like a matter of not being<br/>&gt; &gt; used enough to that interval to hear it for what it is. 10 cent<br/>&gt; &gt; differences in pitch can make quite a difference; we aren&apos;t talking<br/>&gt; &gt; about a 3 cent distinction here.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; It&apos;s like taking the triangle from letter A in this image<br/>&gt; &gt; (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Image:Reification.jpg">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Image:Reification.jpg</a> &gt; &lt;<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Image:Reification.jpg">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Image:Reification.jpg</a>&gt;) and saying<br/>&gt; it&apos;s a<br/>&gt; &gt; &quot;poor&quot; match to a triangle because the sides are incomplete.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; Right off the bat, it is clear that if there&apos;s any legitamcy to<br/>&gt; this approach, reckoning<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &quot;errors&quot; in temperaments would be a very big pain in the ass, for<br/>&gt; a<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; greater &quot;error&quot; (deviation from Just) in an interval could very<br/>&gt; well<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; mean more, and not less, continuity in &quot;flavor&quot; or &quot;hue&quot; or<br/>&gt; whatever.<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; And &quot;shadows&quot;, or zones of ambiguity, rely on NOT being good<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; approximations of intervals, but on being in the (right) wrong<br/>&gt; place<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; in the audible spectrum.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; Agreed. No newts found here.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; Add to this the probability that it&apos;s the gapped-and-lumped<br/>&gt; spectra<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; that make for the nicest<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &quot;Gesamtflangfarben&quot;, and we&apos;re looking at &quot;good&quot; temperaments that<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; might appear on paper to be pretty crappy. As you have certainly<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; noticed, 12-tET, all questions of taste aside, is might flexible,<br/>&gt; and<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; it fits the kind of description I gave above: &quot;damn near perfect 2<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; and 3, and some 19&quot; The 19 is not the &quot;justification&quot; of 12-tET,<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; though who knows if there&apos;s some far-away feeling of it or not-<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; doesn&apos;t matter. &quot;19&quot; just a rough description of the place the<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &quot;shadows&quot; of 12-tET dwell. In the case of 12-tET, it&apos;s the size<br/>&gt; and<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; vagueness of the shadow zones that make it flexible, but when 12-<br/>&gt; tET<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; is taken literally they&apos;re just too damn big and blurry IMO.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; Don&apos;t understand this paragraph.. What do you mean, the 19th<br/>&gt; harmonic?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; What do you mean by justification? Could you elaborate?<br/>&gt; -Mike<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; By justification, I mean you could say that the m3 and M3 of 12-tET<br/>&gt; are approximating 19/16 and 19/15, which they approximate better on<br/>&gt; paper than they do 6/5 and 5/4. Maybe that&apos;s audible or not, doesn&apos;t<br/>&gt; really matter- what they do do is nicely fail to approximate all<br/>&gt; kinds of intervals, remaining vague enough to be interpreted as all<br/>&gt; kinds of things in practice. Autotune, by enforcing 12-tET, is going<br/>&gt; to kill it dead because it robs 12-tET of this, its one true power<br/>&gt; aside from the exactness of the first coupla perfect intervals. The<br/>&gt; 19 approximations are just rough descriptions of where the &quot;fuzz&quot;<br/>&gt; lies. If they do impart some lessening of dissonance, so much the<br/>&gt; better, whatever, but we&apos;re dealing with &quot;fuzzies&quot;, not<br/>&gt; &quot;approximations&quot; in 12-tET, as far as thirds and sixths.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;</p></div><h3>Kraig Grady &#x3C;kraiggrady@...&#x3E;</h3><span>6/11/2008 7:21:58 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>I wholly agree with this which is why i stay on this list:)</p><p>/^_,&apos;,&apos;,&apos;,_ //^ /Kraig Grady_ ^_,&apos;,&apos;,&apos;,_<br/>Mesotonal Music from:<br/>_&apos;&apos;&apos;&apos;&apos;&apos;&apos;_ ^North/Western Hemisphere:  North American Embassy of Anaphoria Island &lt;<a href="http://anaphoria.com/">http://anaphoria.com/</a>&gt;</p><p>_&apos;&apos;&apos;&apos;&apos;&apos;&apos;_ ^South/Eastern Hemisphere:<br/>Austronesian Outpost of Anaphoria &lt;<a href="http://anaphoriasouth.blogspot.com/">http://anaphoriasouth.blogspot.com/</a>&gt;</p><p>&apos;,&apos;,&apos;,&apos;,&apos;,&apos;,&apos;,&apos;,&apos;,&apos;,&apos;,&apos;,&apos;,&apos;,&apos;,&apos;,&apos;,&apos;,&apos;,&apos;,&apos;,&apos;,&apos;,&apos;,&apos;,&apos;,&apos;,&apos;,&apos;,</p><p>Cameron Bobro wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Also I feel quite strongly that there are either more kinds<br/>&gt; of shadows or more ways to get at them than we know.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;</p></div><h3>George D.

Obviously this is kind of a given in musical<br/>&gt; &gt; performance, so more specifically, the character of intervals in<br/>the<br/>&gt; &gt; context of the tuning.<br/>&gt; &gt; Be forewarned that Carl has called my ideas &quot;eye of newt&quot; :-D<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; He does tend to do that, doesn&apos;t he?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; but here goes: every interval has a character and in a tuning<br/>that hangs<br/>&gt; &gt; together, or in which all seems &quot;of a kind&quot; or &quot;from the same<br/>&gt; &gt; pallete&quot;, the intervals share certain color/feeling<br/>characteristics.<br/>&gt; &gt; So I listen for &quot;character families&quot;. An obvious one is like the<br/>&gt; &gt; slightly upwardly detuned 5/4 you mentioned before- it&apos;s a little<br/>&gt; &gt; brighter. If you take for example 34-equal, there are genuine<br/>&gt; &gt; approximations of 6/5 and 5/4; at two cents away it would be<br/>kooky to<br/>&gt; &gt; pretend that there isn&apos;t an obvious relation between the m3 and<br/>M3 of<br/>&gt; &gt; 34-equal, and those of the harmonic partials. They&apos;re the &quot;same&quot;<br/>on<br/>&gt; &gt; one hand, but both are two cents higher and brighter in character<br/>on<br/>&gt; &gt; the other. Throw in the even brighter 34-equal &quot;3/2&quot; and you&apos;ve<br/>got<br/>&gt; &gt; a very clear character family right there in the first six<br/>partials:<br/>&gt; &gt; bright and brassy.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Yeah! That&apos;s always what attracted me to 17-tet, the wider fifths. I<br/>&gt; think it usually sounds good because widening them slightly<br/>&gt; accentuates the intervals that we&apos;re already used to. I also<br/>&gt; hypothesize that it might be because of some resemblance to the<br/>&gt; stretched harmonic series that we often hear in nature (although it<br/>&gt; could just be my own bias). This is why I always liked 12-tet more<br/>&gt; than 19-tet - the third and fifth (and harmonic 7th) are all flat in<br/>&gt; 19-tet, so everything sounds compressed and less accentuated. It<br/>&gt; sounds like my brain is getting compressed. Although, the more I<br/>&gt; listen to 19-tet, the more I like it, so it may just be my own bias<br/>&gt; towards wider intervals that is being expressed here.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I suppose some cross-culture listening tests would have to be<br/>&gt; performed in order to determine whether that theory is due to a<br/>&gt; cultural bias for wider intervals (e.g. the 12tet major third) or<br/>&gt; whether it has some acoustic basis. Honestly I think that the<br/>apparent<br/>&gt; duality here can be resolved by noting that while there is likely<br/>SOME<br/>&gt; acoustic basis on what you initially hear, the matter of whether you<br/>&gt; LIKE what your brain shows you after all of this acoustic and<br/>&gt; psychoacoustic stuff goes down is a different mental process<br/>entirely.<br/>&gt; And then what you like or prefer makes up part of your overall<br/>&gt; perception, or Gestalt. ...</p><p>Hi Mike,</p><p>I made a few comments in which you may be interested, regarding the<br/>melodic properties of wide-fifth vs. narrow-fifth temperaments, in my<br/>17-tone paper (most of which was written in 2001, before I joined the<br/>tuning lists, but not published until 5 years later, in Xenharmonikon<br/>18):<br/><a href="http://xenharmony.wikispaces.com/space/showimage/17puzzle.pdf">http://xenharmony.wikispaces.com/space/showimage/17puzzle.pdf</a><br/>beginning with the section heading in the middle of the 3rd page<br/>(numbered as p. 57).</p><p>In case you decide to read the entire paper (or to entice you to do<br/>so), I also made a 17-tone jazz excerpt using the 9-tone scale<br/>(subset of 17) that I described near the bottom of the 22nd page<br/>(numbered as p. 76):<br/><a href="http://xenharmony.wikispaces.com/space/showimage/17WTjazz.mp3">http://xenharmony.wikispaces.com/space/showimage/17WTjazz.mp3</a></p><p>While we&apos;re on the subject of the psychology of alternative tunings,<br/>there&apos;s a 17-tone piece (by Aaron Krister Johnson) that you might be<br/>interested in listening to, Adagio for Margo, at:<br/><a href="http://www.akjmusic.com/works.html">http://www.akjmusic.com/works.html</a><br/>and then read about a particular observation I made:<br/><a href="http://launch.groups.yahoo.com/group/MakeMicroMusic/message/15247">http://launch.groups.yahoo.com/group/MakeMicroMusic/message/15247</a><br/>and Aaron&apos;s reply:<br/><a href="http://launch.groups.yahoo.com/group/MakeMicroMusic/message/15249">http://launch.groups.yahoo.com/group/MakeMicroMusic/message/15249</a></p><p>--George</p></div><h3>Mike Battaglia &#x3C;battaglia01@...&#x3E;</h3><span>6/11/2008 5:04:30 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>&gt;&gt; Yeah!

It&apos;s kind of a novel sound to<br/>hear beating on an octave at first, but I think most people would like<br/>the sound of it as well. I was more just trying to figure out why<br/>34-et had the sound that it did.</p><p>&gt;&gt; I think a more accurate approach is that a person might interpret 16/9<br/>&gt;&gt; as an out-of-tune 7/4 if they are used to hearing 7/4 and not at all<br/>&gt;&gt; to hearing 16/9. They might then become used to 16/9 as a separate<br/>&gt;&gt; interval in its own right later. This is why I am wary of labeling one<br/>&gt;&gt; particular person&apos;s response to an interval or chord as though it were<br/>&gt;&gt; something the &quot;brain&quot; does. One person&apos;s brain might exhibit a certain<br/>&gt;&gt; behavior as the neurological correlate of a psychological<br/>&gt;&gt; interpretation, but then attempting to generalize that behavior to<br/>&gt;&gt; -all- people falls prey to the same fallacy that is currently ruining<br/>&gt;&gt; how music theory is being taught in America.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; The psychoacoustic results that I&apos;m aware of say that the<br/>&gt; traditional assignment of chord roots is correct -- that is,<br/>&gt; naive listeners will hear A as the root of an A minor chord<br/>&gt; (A-C-E). For that to work we must be interpreting A-C as an<br/>&gt; out of tune 4:5. Given that, it&apos;s entirely plausible that<br/>&gt; 16/9 is interpreted as 7/4. Of course, we&apos;re also quite<br/>&gt; capable of telling the difference between major and minor<br/>&gt; thirds.</p><p>What do you mean by this? You think that given the note &quot;A&quot; people<br/>will fill in that it&apos;s the root of a minor chord due to them somehow<br/>intuitively knowing its diatonic role in a C major scale...? Or do you<br/>mean that, given the key of C major, we will perceive the note &quot;A&quot; in<br/>a chord root as having a minor quality, due to priming effects?</p><p>Furthermore, are you suggesting that the feeling and perception of a<br/>minor triad is due to its proximity to a major third, but its being<br/>out of tune gives it the &quot;sad&quot; minor feel to it? The concept seems to<br/>be at odds with the one that Carl was referring to above, i.e. that<br/>both 5/4 and 6/5 will have their own fields of attraction.</p><p>What psychoacoustic results are you referring to in this case? I&apos;d<br/>really like to see them.</p><p>&gt; Beyond that I don&apos;t think it&apos;s helpful or even meaningful to<br/>&gt; argue about what interval some other interval&apos;s heard in<br/>&gt; terms of. Generally, an interval is what it is and, as you<br/>&gt; say, it&apos;s only interpreted as a different interval if that<br/>&gt; other interval happens to be one the listener&apos;s already<br/>&gt; familiar with. The exceptions may be octaves and fifths.</p><p>I think I agree with you. It seemed to me like Carl was saying that<br/>these intervals will be approximated in terms of other intervals<br/>because of psychoacoustic effects that are done in the brain, and that<br/>the listener has no input or affect on this whatsoever. What &quot;mental<br/>label&quot; people assign to an interval, even unconsciously, would<br/>obviously have something to do with what labels they have.</p><p>Even deeper, regardless of how people consciously assign verbal<br/>meaning to intervals, everyone has an internal cognitive &quot;schema&quot; or<br/>symbol for an interval that they may or may not be aware of. At first,<br/>when you hear a new interval that is close to an interval you already<br/>know, you might experience it as an altered form of a mental symbol<br/>that you already have, but after being constantly exposed to that<br/>interval and its symbolic meaning for you, you may learn to<br/>differentiate between that symbol and the other one. You will most<br/>likely operate on the new symbol and come up with new thoughts derived<br/>from it, and build on that schema just as you did the other one. What<br/>role, then, would the concept of a purely acoustic &quot;field of<br/>attraction&quot; have in this process anymore? You could potentially start<br/>to develop another field of attraction around a second interval as<br/>there is one around the first one.</p><p>It&apos;s sort of the equivalent of if the only two colors you know are red<br/>and orange. You then run into reddish-orange for the first time. Are<br/>you going to view that as a shade of red, or as a shade of orange? You<br/>might view it either way, or have a multistable perception of the<br/>color that &quot;flickers&quot; back and forth between the two. Eventually,<br/>though, you might develop your own internal &quot;symbol&quot; or feeling for it<br/>in the same way that you have a symbol for red and green and such, and<br/>then draw inferences from it, such as perhaps starting to see how the<br/>color would be used in a visual context for artistic effect.<br/>Ironically, men and women often display disparities in their abilities<br/>in this area, with men often categorizing and seeing everything in<br/>terms of being shades of colors they already know, and women seeing<br/>the colors as colors in their own right.</p><p>Psychologically, I think it depends on whether you build your schema<br/>of an experience based on the physical experience alone, or whether<br/>you build it based on another schema, though that might be slightly<br/>out of context here.</p><p>&gt;&gt; I never really understood the otonality and utonality thing... It<br/>&gt;&gt; makes sense at first but breaks down the further you get into it. A<br/>&gt;&gt; minor chord is both a utonality and an otonality, depending on how you<br/>&gt;&gt; look at it. So is a major chord.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; A minor chord as 10:12:15 is a 5-limit utonality or a<br/>&gt; 15-limit otonality. In a 5-limit context there&apos;s only one<br/>&gt; interpretation.</p><p>Ah, gotcha. It makes sense in terms of the limit that the chord is.</p><p>&gt;&gt; Another example of what you&apos;re talking about here I think is the good<br/>&gt;&gt; ol&apos; neutral triad... I have a multistable perception of neutral triad<br/>&gt;&gt; as an out of tune major and an out of tune minor simultaneously. I<br/>&gt;&gt; suspect that the more I listen to it the more I will get used to it as<br/>&gt;&gt; a stable chord in its own right, and then that interval will develop<br/>&gt;&gt; its own &quot;field of attraction&quot; apart from the major and the minor one.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Discordance graphs tend to show a kind of plateau between<br/>&gt; major and minor thirds. So any third will do. Whether<br/>&gt; that&apos;s because 6:5 and 5:4 merge into each other or because<br/>&gt; they merge in with 11:9 and 16:13 doesn&apos;t matter at all.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt; I suspect that fields of attraction are not drawn around actual<br/>&gt;&gt; harmonic intervals, but around the MEMORIES we have of intervals. It<br/>&gt;&gt; has to do with a tendency<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; A meaningful question is: do intervals like 11:9 represent<br/>&gt; minimum points of dissonance? This is the concept of<br/>&gt; &quot;tunable intervals&quot;. If intervals sound more consonant the<br/>&gt; closer they get to some ideal, it&apos;s worth considering that<br/>&gt; ideal when you choose a tuning or notation.</p><p>I just screwed around with this in scala for a bit, and I think that<br/>at least I am interpreting 11/9 as a flat version of 17/14. I&apos;m not<br/>sure why or what about that interval would make it sound so consonant,<br/>but I screwed around with the cents ratios and I found it to sound the<br/>most like a &quot;new chord&quot; when the neutral third got up to like 333.67<br/>cents, which is in the ball park of 17/14.</p><p>Actually, from looking at it further, 17/14 - 11/9 (if you subtract<br/>the numerators and denominators) is 6/5, which if you subtract 11/9<br/>from 6/5 gives you 5/4. So maybe I&apos;m really just getting closer to<br/>that &quot;noble number&quot; limit that was posted above...</p><p>&gt; There was a programme on the BBC a while back which I have<br/>&gt; on Mini Disc -- but not with me. I think I liked some<br/>&gt; Murail best.

I&apos;ll buy 607 and anything in the region of<br/>about +/- 5 cents or so around the square root of two. 645 cents I<br/>haven&apos;t heard as a shadow, maybe in some context, we&apos;ll see.</p><p>&gt; after 13/9 we certainly couldn&apos;t claim to be taking the noble<br/>&gt;mediant<br/>&gt; of two Just intervals, so we&apos;re into &quot;eye of newt&quot; territory. e.g.<br/>&gt; (3+16phi)/(2+11phi) ~= 654 cents</p><p>I hear 654 as something else. It&apos;s groovy but it doesn&apos;t fit as far<br/>as I can hear.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; And the 670 cent Merciful certainly can&apos;t be &quot;explained&quot; by noble<br/>&gt; numbers, since they get very complex and only 3 or 4 cents apart, by<br/>&gt; the time you get to that region.</p><p>Well it&apos;s 5/4 above the noble dark minor third (the square root of<br/>two being 6/5 above). I think that&apos;s it, and that&apos;s how I use it a<br/>lot. This makes for a very &quot;far-away&quot; kind of diminished triad, try<br/>it.</p><p>&gt;<br/>&gt; It might be &quot;explained&quot; by HE if only that maximum didn&apos;t move<br/>&gt;around<br/>&gt; so much as &quot;s&quot; is changed.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Do we even know if different people find these 656 and 670 cent<br/>&gt; merciful intervals to be in the same place, given the same physical<br/>setup?</p><p>Now that we don&apos;t know at all. At this point I suspect that only<br/>33/28 and 23/18, and the phi-th of the octave &quot;sixth&quot;, speaking with<br/>a slop of a cent or so plus/minus, have been more or less<br/>&quot;independently observed&quot; or used in enough different ways to qualify<br/>as &quot;definites&quot; as in &quot;there&apos;s definitely SOMETHING going on there&quot;.</p><p>-Cameron Bobro</p></div><h3>Dave Keenan &#x3C;d.keenan@...&#x3E;</h3><span>6/11/2008 10:36:17 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Hi Kraig,</p><p>In La Monte Young&apos;s case they really are higher harmonics,<br/>electronically phase-locked, so it really is JI.</p><p>But maybe we&apos;re talking about two different things here.

For that to work we must be interpreting A-C as an<br/>&gt;&gt; out of tune 4:5. Given that, it&apos;s entirely plausible that<br/>&gt;&gt; 16/9 is interpreted as 7/4. Of course, we&apos;re also quite<br/>&gt;&gt; capable of telling the difference between major and minor<br/>&gt;&gt; thirds.<br/>&gt; &gt; What do you mean by this? You think that given the note &quot;A&quot; people<br/>&gt; will fill in that it&apos;s the root of a minor chord due to them somehow<br/>&gt; intuitively knowing its diatonic role in a C major scale...? Or do you<br/>&gt; mean that, given the key of C major, we will perceive the note &quot;A&quot; in<br/>&gt; a chord root as having a minor quality, due to priming effects?</p><p>I think that given the chord A-C-E people will associate A as being the root.  And that association is natural and connected with the virtual pitch mechanism.</p><p>&gt; Furthermore, are you suggesting that the feeling and perception of a<br/>&gt; minor triad is due to its proximity to a major third, but its being<br/>&gt; out of tune gives it the &quot;sad&quot; minor feel to it? The concept seems to<br/>&gt; be at odds with the one that Carl was referring to above, i.e. that<br/>&gt; both 5/4 and 6/5 will have their own fields of attraction.</p><p>The feeling and perception of a minor triad follows from it being a minor triad, and being tuned a specific way and played with specific timbres.  I don&apos;t know I how should expect it to feel if it was or wasn&apos;t attracted to 4:5:6, 10:12:15, 16:19:24, or anything else.</p><p>&gt; What psychoacoustic results are you referring to in this case? I&apos;d<br/>&gt; really like to see them.</p><p><a href="http://www.mmk.e-technik.tu-muenchen.de/persons/ter/top/basse.html">http://www.mmk.e-technik.tu-muenchen.de/persons/ter/top/basse.html</a></p><p>These links are new to me:</p><p><a href="http://home.austin.rr.com/jmjensen/VirtualPitch.html">http://home.austin.rr.com/jmjensen/VirtualPitch.html</a><br/><a href="http://www.springerlink.com/content/d137684108735m25/">http://www.springerlink.com/content/d137684108735m25/</a></p><p>Incidentally, this may relate to your problem of a b9 being bad in a chord without the root.  The reason being that the b9 is easily confused with the root if you don&apos;t reinforce the latter.</p><p>&gt; Even deeper, regardless of how people consciously assign verbal<br/>&gt; meaning to intervals, everyone has an internal cognitive &quot;schema&quot; or<br/>&gt; symbol for an interval that they may or may not be aware of. At first,<br/>&gt; when you hear a new interval that is close to an interval you already<br/>&gt; know, you might experience it as an altered form of a mental symbol<br/>&gt; that you already have, but after being constantly exposed to that<br/>&gt; interval and its symbolic meaning for you, you may learn to<br/>&gt; differentiate between that symbol and the other one. You will most<br/>&gt; likely operate on the new symbol and come up with new thoughts derived<br/>&gt; from it, and build on that schema just as you did the other one. What<br/>&gt; role, then, would the concept of a purely acoustic &quot;field of<br/>&gt; attraction&quot; have in this process anymore? You could potentially start<br/>&gt; to develop another field of attraction around a second interval as<br/>&gt; there is one around the first one.</p><p>If you care about your listeners, the lesson to take from this is that they won&apos;t be as familiar with the intervals you&apos;re working with as you are.  So they&apos;ll naturally hear them relative to some other intervals.  You can either help them to hear things the way you do or play with their confusion.</p><p>&gt;&gt;&gt; Another example of what you&apos;re talking about here I think is the good<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt; ol&apos; neutral triad... I have a multistable perception of neutral triad<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt; as an out of tune major and an out of tune minor simultaneously. I<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt; suspect that the more I listen to it the more I will get used to it as<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt; a stable chord in its own right, and then that interval will develop<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt; its own &quot;field of attraction&quot; apart from the major and the minor one.<br/>&gt;&gt; Discordance graphs tend to show a kind of plateau between<br/>&gt;&gt; major and minor thirds. So any third will do. Whether<br/>&gt;&gt; that&apos;s because 6:5 and 5:4 merge into each other or because<br/>&gt;&gt; they merge in with 11:9 and 16:13 doesn&apos;t matter at all.<br/>&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt; I suspect that fields of attraction are not drawn around actual<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt; harmonic intervals, but around the MEMORIES we have of intervals. It<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt; has to do with a tendency<br/>&gt;&gt; A meaningful question is: do intervals like 11:9 represent<br/>&gt;&gt; minimum points of dissonance? This is the concept of<br/>&gt;&gt; &quot;tunable intervals&quot;. If intervals sound more consonant the<br/>&gt;&gt; closer they get to some ideal, it&apos;s worth considering that<br/>&gt;&gt; ideal when you choose a tuning or notation.<br/>&gt; &gt; I just screwed around with this in scala for a bit, and I think that<br/>&gt; at least I am interpreting 11/9 as a flat version of 17/14. I&apos;m not<br/>&gt; sure why or what about that interval would make it sound so consonant,<br/>&gt; but I screwed around with the cents ratios and I found it to sound the<br/>&gt; most like a &quot;new chord&quot; when the neutral third got up to like 333.67<br/>&gt; cents, which is in the ball park of 17/14.<br/>&gt; &gt; Actually, from looking at it further, 17/14 - 11/9 (if you subtract<br/>&gt; the numerators and denominators) is 6/5, which if you subtract 11/9<br/>&gt; from 6/5 gives you 5/4. So maybe I&apos;m really just getting closer to<br/>&gt; that &quot;noble number&quot; limit that was posted above...</p><p>A nearby noble number interval is (5+6*phi)/(4+5*phi) at 339 cents.  Simplifies as (1+5*phi)/(1+4*phi).</p><p>                       Graham</p></div><h3>Mike Battaglia &#x3C;battaglia01@...&#x3E;</h3><span>6/12/2008 1:02:33 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>On Thu, Jun 12, 2008 at 1:04 AM, Carl Lumma &lt;carl@...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt; Mike wrote:<br/>&gt;&gt; To be honest, I wasn&apos;t really sure what you were saying at all<br/>&gt;&gt; at some points in this thread,<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I know.

For that to work we must be interpreting A-C as an<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt; out of tune 4:5. Given that, it&apos;s entirely plausible that<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt; 16/9 is interpreted as 7/4. Of course, we&apos;re also quite<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt; capable of telling the difference between major and minor<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt; thirds.<br/>&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt; What do you mean by this? You think that given the note &quot;A&quot; people<br/>&gt;&gt; will fill in that it&apos;s the root of a minor chord due to them somehow<br/>&gt;&gt; intuitively knowing its diatonic role in a C major scale...? Or do you<br/>&gt;&gt; mean that, given the key of C major, we will perceive the note &quot;A&quot; in<br/>&gt;&gt; a chord root as having a minor quality, due to priming effects?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I think that given the chord A-C-E people will associate A<br/>&gt; as being the root. And that association is natural and<br/>&gt; connected with the virtual pitch mechanism.</p><p>Ah, wow. That&apos;s astounding. I have never thought of that before.<br/>You&apos;re talking about how they hear the root as A as opposed to the<br/>phantom fundamental of F, right? That makes perfect sense -- also why<br/>major 7 chords have a sometimes melancholy tone to them.</p><p>Although, I was just thinking, at least for 12tet an A-C-E minor chord<br/>actually HAS an A fundamental, because that A-C is pretty close to<br/>16:19, so the fundamental will be 4 octaves below the A. I remember<br/>playing A and C simultaneously on a vibraphone and hearing that low A,<br/>wondering why it wasn&apos;t an F (I didn&apos;t realize the 16:19 relationship<br/>before). Might that have something to do with it?</p><p>&gt;&gt; What psychoacoustic results are you referring to in this case? I&apos;d<br/>&gt;&gt; really like to see them.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; <a href="http://www.mmk.e-technik.tu-muenchen.de/persons/ter/top/basse.html">http://www.mmk.e-technik.tu-muenchen.de/persons/ter/top/basse.html</a></p><p>I checked this one out, I&apos;m not sure how this relates to hearing 6/5<br/>as a mistuning of 5/4.</p><p>&gt; These links are new to me:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; <a href="http://home.austin.rr.com/jmjensen/VirtualPitch.html">http://home.austin.rr.com/jmjensen/VirtualPitch.html</a><br/>&gt; <a href="http://www.springerlink.com/content/d137684108735m25/">http://www.springerlink.com/content/d137684108735m25/</a></p><p>The virtual pitch one was interesting. For an equal tempered C E G,<br/>the fundamental that it calculated was an F, likely due to the E being<br/>as sharp as it is.</p><p>&gt; Incidentally, this may relate to your problem of a b9 being<br/>&gt; bad in a chord without the root. The reason being that the<br/>&gt; b9 is easily confused with the root if you don&apos;t reinforce<br/>&gt; the latter.</p><p>Erm, the rule was that a b9 can be in a chord unless it is placed over<br/>a note that isn&apos;t the root. So the following:</p><p>C E G Bb Db</p><p>is okay, but this chord:</p><p>C E G B D F</p><p>is not, because there is a b9 between E and F, and F isn&apos;t the root.</p><p>Carl&apos;s explanation (which I am growing to understand) is that the F on<br/>top is right in the middle of a 4/3 ratio and so completely undermines<br/>the structure and resonance of the chord (at least that&apos;s what I make<br/>of it). It&apos;s like you have all of these tones in an otonal<br/>relationship, and then that F on top screws it all up.</p><p>In jazz, leaving the root out of a chord is encouraged (likely because<br/>they&apos;ve figured out you&apos;re going to hear it anyway), and you often get<br/>some weird situations where an E-G-B minor chord is played, but the<br/>right hand can play melodies so that you hear the root as the C below<br/>it, and the chord stops sounding minor (although it sounds precarious,<br/>as though at any point it could slip back into minor). Weirdness, I<br/>tell you.</p><p>I think this rule is probably a rough attempt at figuring out some<br/>considerably more difficult harmonic principles, but it is sort of<br/>accurate.</p><p>&gt; If you care about your listeners, the lesson to take from<br/>&gt; this is that they won&apos;t be as familiar with the intervals<br/>&gt; you&apos;re working with as you are. So they&apos;ll naturally hear<br/>&gt; them relative to some other intervals. You can either help<br/>&gt; them to hear things the way you do or play with their confusion.</p><p>Precisely. From a musical standpoint, indeed. I would also like to<br/>figure out precisely how this works, as I find it a fascinating<br/>mechanism that would likely have a lot of useful results for tuning<br/>theory. It seems to be based entirely off of cognitive/gestalt psych<br/>(or both), although the assertion earlier that there are purely<br/>psychoacoustic fields of attraction completely threw a wrench into the<br/>works in terms of how I was figuring this all out. I can&apos;t tell if<br/>they are simply not entirely psychoacoustic after all, and any theory<br/>saying that they are is wrong, or if I&apos;m missing something obvious.</p><p>&gt; A nearby noble number interval is (5+6*phi)/(4+5*phi) at 339<br/>&gt; cents. Simplifies as (1+5*phi)/(1+4*phi).</p><p>Interesting. I actually posted the wrong number - I was looking at 366<br/>cents, which doesn&apos;t have any noble anything near it. It had the<br/>feeling of slightly major, but musically gray at the same time. I&apos;m<br/>not sure what that&apos;s about.</p><p>One thing I&apos;ve noticed about the noble numbers is that two of them<br/>exist between any interval. You have the one generated by going from<br/>5/4, 6/5, etc...

Although now I hear a bird in<br/>&gt; the<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; distance singing some kind of flat major third, and it does<br/>&gt; seem to<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; sound like the 366 one I was saying that stuck out as a grey<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; interval<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; in the other thread.

The harmonics are damped so it doesn&apos;t<br/>&gt;&gt; kill you.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I only heard one tone.</p><p>That one tone you heard was a complex waveform generated by placing<br/>sine waves on top of each other in the fashion described above. The<br/>fact that you heard it as one bell-like tone demonstrates my point :P</p><p>The reason that you heard it as at one tone rather than as a chord is<br/>because the harmonics are damped. Rather than generate a harmonic<br/>series so that you&apos;d hear a sawtooth wave, I simply took the<br/>fundamental and multiplied it by phi. Then I multiplied the resultant<br/>by phi, and so on and so on. But for each resultant, I decreased the<br/>amplitude by 1/phi^n, where n is the number of tones into the sequence<br/>we&apos;re at for any given tone.</p><p>&gt;&gt; So transcendental numbers have their use in JI after all :P<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Noble numbers are not transcendental as far as I know. Phi certainly<br/>&gt; isn&apos;t since it is (sqrt(5)+1)/2, the solution of x^2 -x -1 = 0.</p><p>Oh yeah. Whoops. I meant &quot;irrational numbers that are not the root of<br/>some rational number&quot;. E.g. phi, although having sqrt(5) in it, is not<br/>going to give you a rational when you do phi^5. In fact, phi^anything<br/>will never be a rational number.</p><p>&gt; Pi is transcendental, but I see no evidence of its applicability in<br/>&gt; this regard. There is no known mechanism for it to do so. Whereas the<br/>&gt; phi-derived nobles guarantee tha we maximise what you say immediately<br/>&gt; below.</p><p>Ah I dunno what pi&apos;s about. Charles Lucy talks about it a lot. I<br/>dunno. Something about how you have to beat the pi to get the<br/>frequency... and spherical wavefronts and the beating and god knows<br/>anymore. I&apos;m sure he knows what he&apos;s talking about, but I sure as hell<br/>don&apos;t.</p><p>&gt;&gt; The tones<br/>&gt;&gt; will never end up syncing up with anything in the harmonic series of<br/>&gt;&gt; the fundamental ever.<br/>&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt; Perhaps the &quot;transcendental intervals?&quot; Or why not just the &quot;golden<br/>&gt;&gt; intervals?&quot;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &quot;golden&quot; is generally reserved only for the _most_ noble number, phi<br/>&gt; (and its reciprocal). The name &quot;noble&quot; here comes from analogy with<br/>&gt; the noble metals, of which gold is but one -- the most noble.</p><p>oh phine (haha). however you want it.</p><p>&gt; But the main objection to names such as these is that some of these<br/>&gt; grey or shadow intervals do not correspond to noble numbers at all, at<br/>&gt; least not simple ones.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt; The &quot;neutral intervals?&quot;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Neutral intervals are those around midway between major and minor<br/>&gt; intervals of the same diatonic degree. While some shadows are neutral,<br/>&gt; some are not.</p><p>What gray/noble/shadow/mystic/double top secret intervals are out<br/>there that aren&apos;t neutral? Like one between 5/4 and 4/3 or something?</p><p>&gt;&gt; &quot;grey intervals?&quot; They&apos;re<br/>&gt;&gt; definitely gray to me, though I propose that if we call them gray<br/>&gt;&gt; intervals, we spell it &quot;grey,&quot; for various aesthetic reasons.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &quot;Grey&quot; is fine with me too. &quot;Shadowy&quot; and &quot;grey&quot; are of course quite<br/>&gt; similar in meaning.</p><p>Yeah, but gray is a color, and they have blue notes, and I want my<br/>gray notes, god damn it! That&apos;s all I&apos;m saying.

At the time, I had just heard<br/>for the first time Easley Blackwood&apos;s 17-tet &quot;con moto&quot; work from his<br/>Twelve Microtonal Etudes album and found it extraordinarily beautiful<br/>in its mood, and immediately set out about finding information as much<br/>information on the tuning as I could.</p><p>The only other equal tuning I was familiar with at the time that<br/>sounded even plausible for western music was 19-tet, which at the time<br/>I found to be somewhat unsatisfactory, as the only compositions that<br/>I&apos;d heard in the tuning sounded at the time really &quot;dirty&quot; and with a<br/>very &quot;nervous&quot; feel to them at the time. To put it bluntly, it sounded<br/>&quot;out of tune.&quot; Most of my friends who I was trying to get into<br/>microtonal music felt the same way about it. Either way, we all<br/>thought the 17-tet piece sounded amazing, particularly with regards to<br/>the melody. If anything, it sounded MORE &quot;in tune&quot; than 12-tet, which<br/>is more than I could say for 19-tet.</p><p>Actually, upon hearing this piece for the first time, I thought that<br/>perhaps it WAS the much-heralded 19-tet that was so often cited as<br/>being such an improvement on 12-equal. After I saw that it was<br/>actually 17-tet (which I had never even heard cited as being plausible<br/>for &quot;normal&quot; sounding music before), I started looking up information<br/>on it, the only useful information on it really being the paper you<br/>linked me to.</p><p>This paragraph:<br/>&quot;In spite of all this, I am forced to admit that, while I do not find<br/>the larger semitones of 19-ET, 31-ET, and the meantone temperament<br/>unacceptable, I still do not perceive them as being as effective<br/>melodically as those of 12-ET or the Pythagorean tuning.</p><p>Instead, I have found that the diatonic scales that are most<br/>melodically effective are those that have wide fifths, resulting in<br/>diatonic semitones significantly smaller than those in 12-ET. There is<br/>considerable evidence to indicate that I am not alone in making this<br/>judgment, which serves as a premise upon which the following line of<br/>reasoning is based.&quot;</p><p>Generally did wonders for pointing out things about the temperament<br/>that I had suspected but lacked a way of articulating. To this day,<br/>what still bothers me about 19-et is that all of the chord intervals,<br/>melodic motions, and chord modulations/root movements are LESS<br/>articulated than in 12-et. That is, they are all &apos;flatter.&apos; They are<br/>smaller in distance. There is less movement. This to me gives me the<br/>impression of all of the motions being sort of half-assed, e.g.<br/>they&apos;re &quot;good enough,&quot; but not really good. We don&apos;t have<br/>C!-&gt;G!-&gt;E!-&gt;B!-&gt;C! but rather c... g... e... b#... *sigh* and the<br/>like. To be honest, if 19-equal were the dominant tuning system in<br/>western music, I really suspect that this group would have three times<br/>as many members, with most of them extolling the virtues of 12-equal<br/>as a much more melodic and harmonic alternative.</p><p>On the other hand, I found the melodic movements of 17-et to be<br/>extremely articulated and as such the piece I keep referring to on<br/>Blackwood&apos;s album is the one I usually play if I&apos;m only going to play<br/>one. I notice now that for the chords, he used a timbre with a bit of<br/>chorus/LFO and played extremely staccato chords, presumably to hide<br/>the beating and out-of-tuneness of the mainly 5-limit thing he seems<br/>to do with that piece.</p><p>This isn&apos;t to bash 19-tet too much... :) I have grown to like it, but<br/>I view it more as some kind of &quot;counterpart&quot; to 17 and to some extent<br/>12. 17 has mainly sharp intervals, 19 has mainly flat intervals, so<br/>they&apos;re like the difference between night and day. 12 is sort of in<br/>the middle but closer to 17 with its major third.</p><p>I am very interested though in hearing some of the pieces or musical<br/>excerpts that you or Margo worked out as you described in your<br/>paper... If you&apos;ve find harmonic and melodic concepts that sound<br/>similar to &quot;standard&quot; 5-limit ones, but sound interesting and new at<br/>the same time, I would certainly like to hear them.</p><p>&gt; In case you decide to read the entire paper (or to entice you to do<br/>&gt; so), I also made a 17-tone jazz excerpt using the 9-tone scale<br/>&gt; (subset of 17) that I described near the bottom of the 22nd page<br/>&gt; (numbered as p. 76):<br/>&gt; <a href="http://xenharmony.wikispaces.com/space/showimage/17WTjazz.mp3">http://xenharmony.wikispaces.com/space/showimage/17WTjazz.mp3</a></p><p>Haha, wow. Neutral moondance. Dusk-dance? Twilight perhaps? Interesting.</p><p>&gt; While we&apos;re on the subject of the psychology of alternative tunings,<br/>&gt; there&apos;s a 17-tone piece (by Aaron Krister Johnson) that you might be<br/>&gt; interested in listening to, Adagio for Margo, at:<br/>&gt; <a href="http://www.akjmusic.com/works.html">http://www.akjmusic.com/works.html</a><br/>&gt; and then read about a particular observation I made:<br/>&gt; <a href="http://launch.groups.yahoo.com/group/MakeMicroMusic/message/15247">http://launch.groups.yahoo.com/group/MakeMicroMusic/message/15247</a><br/>&gt; and Aaron&apos;s reply:<br/>&gt; <a href="http://launch.groups.yahoo.com/group/MakeMicroMusic/message/15249">http://launch.groups.yahoo.com/group/MakeMicroMusic/message/15249</a></p><p>Yes. Yes. Yes. Exactly. This sentence:</p><p>&quot;In other words, the diatonic system is<br/>really a musical language, and our success in creating music in<br/>alternative tunings may depend on our ability to create (or discover)<br/>other musical languages that are capable of becoming meaningful to<br/>the general listener.&quot;</p><p>sums up perfectly everything I was trying to say in that other thread.<br/>I&apos;m trying to figure out, as a field of scientific inquiry, how it<br/>works, how a listener BUILDS this language to begin with, how a<br/>listener learns expands his language, why listeners sometimes treat<br/>incoming musical concepts or tunings as &quot;wrong versions&quot; of something<br/>else already in their existing language, and how to get them to not do<br/>that. I don&apos;t know why I kept getting allegations of my ideas being<br/>pseudoscientific or misguided in the other thread, but it&apos;s glad to<br/>finally see someone else thinking along the same lines.</p><p>That being said, I also had some thoughts on this:</p><p>&quot;When we listen to a diatonic composition with only two voice parts<br/>(such as a Bach two-part keyboard invention), we are able to &quot;hear&quot;<br/>harmonies that are there only in the sense that they are implied by<br/>tonal relationships already familiar to both the composer and the<br/>listener. A two-voice composition in some non-diatonic scale subset<br/>of a non-12 tuning, on the other hand, would very likely not have the<br/>same effect, but would be heard basically as a progression of<br/>intervals -- unless the composer had first written other (successful)<br/>pieces in that scale using full harmonies and the listener had also<br/>become familiar with them.&quot;</p><p>I think there are two parts to it:</p><p>1: the sum-and-difference tones generated by a dyad<br/>2: the cognitive labeling of the whole package by the listener</p><p>For intervals like a perfect fifth, a major third, perfect fourth,<br/>minor third, etc... The sum and difference tones are quite pronounced<br/>and align perfectly in a harmonic series. For intervals like a 9:11<br/>neutral third, the sum and difference tones are going to be in a<br/>harmonic series though, but that difference tone will be MUCH lower<br/>than the chord tones. It will be low enough that if your focus is in<br/>the midrange where the chord tones are, you might miss this &quot;phantom<br/>fundamental&quot; virtual tone (even subconsciously). Once you meditate on<br/>a neutral triad and grow used to it, however, you start to pick up on<br/>the resonance of the chord and hear it in a harmonic context. However,<br/>the average listener who hasn&apos;t been accustomed to the sound might be<br/>confused and hear it as a mistuned major or minor chord, since that&apos;s<br/>the only other thing they have to go by.</p><p>But just like people did eventually get used to the sound of major<br/>chords and perfect fifths, I think there are probably clever ways to<br/>find intervals that a listener will most likely hear as new and novel<br/>rather than weird and disturbing. For some reason, for people<br/>accustomed to 12-tet, the 7/6 subminor third is usually such an<br/>&quot;easy-to-grasp&quot; interval, although a 9/7 supermajor third doesn&apos;t<br/>share that characteristic and is often heard simply as a sharp 5/4.<br/>Why this is, I haven&apos;t the foggiest, although it might be interesting<br/>to study.</p><p>Furthermore, I hypothesize that just like perfect fifths can be played<br/>lower than major thirds and still sound good (due to that phantom<br/>fundamental dropping off the bottom of hearing range sooner for the<br/>major thirds), there will be triads that sound muddy straight up until<br/>the midrange of the piano, although I don&apos;t know what those triads are<br/>yet.</p><p>I&apos;m actually running on no sleep right now, so I apologize if any of<br/>my post didn&apos;t make sense.

I remember<br/>&gt; playing A and C simultaneously on a vibraphone and hearing that low A,<br/>&gt; wondering why it wasn&apos;t an F (I didn&apos;t realize the 16:19 relationship<br/>&gt; before).

For an equal tempered C E G,<br/>&gt; the fundamental that it calculated was an F, likely due to the E being<br/>&gt; as sharp as it is.</p><p>There you go ... I don&apos;t know how reliable the code is.</p><p>&gt;&gt; Incidentally, this may relate to your problem of a b9 being<br/>&gt;&gt; bad in a chord without the root. The reason being that the<br/>&gt;&gt; b9 is easily confused with the root if you don&apos;t reinforce<br/>&gt;&gt; the latter.<br/>&gt; &gt; Erm, the rule was that a b9 can be in a chord unless it is placed over<br/>&gt; a note that isn&apos;t the root. So the following:<br/>&gt; &gt; C E G Bb Db<br/>&gt; &gt; is okay, but this chord:<br/>&gt; &gt; C E G B D F<br/>&gt; &gt; is not, because there is a b9 between E and F, and F isn&apos;t the root.</p><p>Okay.  It could be because E-F gets heard as a stretched octave, then, and supports E as the root.  But probably not.</p><p>&gt; Carl&apos;s explanation (which I am growing to understand) is that the F on<br/>&gt; top is right in the middle of a 4/3 ratio and so completely undermines<br/>&gt; the structure and resonance of the chord (at least that&apos;s what I make<br/>&gt; of it). It&apos;s like you have all of these tones in an otonal<br/>&gt; relationship, and then that F on top screws it all up.</p><p>You mean a 4/3 between C and a transposed F?  Could be.  I agree that it&apos;s a weaker chord, anyway, as far as I can get it to work on my magic keyboard (I haven&apos;t got meantone working yet).</p><p>&gt; In jazz, leaving the root out of a chord is encouraged (likely because<br/>&gt; they&apos;ve figured out you&apos;re going to hear it anyway), and you often get<br/>&gt; some weird situations where an E-G-B minor chord is played, but the<br/>&gt; right hand can play melodies so that you hear the root as the C below<br/>&gt; it, and the chord stops sounding minor (although it sounds precarious,<br/>&gt; as though at any point it could slip back into minor). Weirdness, I<br/>&gt; tell you.</p><p>This is the point where I&apos;m glad I don&apos;t have to study jazz harmony :P</p><p>&gt; I think this rule is probably a rough attempt at figuring out some<br/>&gt; considerably more difficult harmonic principles, but it is sort of<br/>&gt; accurate.</p><p>Or it&apos;s a language that made sense to musicians as they were fitting tunes to chords.</p><p>&gt;&gt; If you care about your listeners, the lesson to take from<br/>&gt;&gt; this is that they won&apos;t be as familiar with the intervals<br/>&gt;&gt; you&apos;re working with as you are. So they&apos;ll naturally hear<br/>&gt;&gt; them relative to some other intervals. You can either help<br/>&gt;&gt; them to hear things the way you do or play with their confusion.<br/>&gt; &gt; Precisely. From a musical standpoint, indeed. I would also like to<br/>&gt; figure out precisely how this works, as I find it a fascinating<br/>&gt; mechanism that would likely have a lot of useful results for tuning<br/>&gt; theory. It seems to be based entirely off of cognitive/gestalt psych<br/>&gt; (or both), although the assertion earlier that there are purely<br/>&gt; psychoacoustic fields of attraction completely threw a wrench into the<br/>&gt; works in terms of how I was figuring this all out. I can&apos;t tell if<br/>&gt; they are simply not entirely psychoacoustic after all, and any theory<br/>&gt; saying that they are is wrong, or if I&apos;m missing something obvious.</p><p>There&apos;s a book by Krumhansl that has some interesting research into how tonal harmony is perceived.</p><p>&gt;&gt; A nearby noble number interval is (5+6*phi)/(4+5*phi) at 339<br/>&gt;&gt; cents. Simplifies as (1+5*phi)/(1+4*phi).<br/>&gt; &gt; Interesting. I actually posted the wrong number - I was looking at 366<br/>&gt; cents, which doesn&apos;t have any noble anything near it. It had the<br/>&gt; feeling of slightly major, but musically gray at the same time. I&apos;m<br/>&gt; not sure what that&apos;s about.</p><p>Kraig and Cameron have both reported that 366.9 cents is the ratio between the golden ratio and on octave.  That&apos;s an interesting idea -- the interval between a shadow interval and a just one.  You can call it (2+2*phi)/(1+2*phi)</p><p>&gt; One thing I&apos;ve noticed about the noble numbers is that two of them<br/>&gt; exist between any interval. You have the one generated by going from<br/>&gt; 5/4, 6/5, etc... And the one from 6/5, 5/4, etc. You&apos;ll end up at<br/>&gt; different places.</p><p>The true one is the zig-zag starting on the simpler interval.  That means the multipliers by phi should be in the more complex one.  So the true shadow between 5/4 and 6/5 is the target of the sequence 5/4, 6/5, 11/9, 17/14, 28/23, ... or</p><p>5 + 6*phi<br/>---------<br/>4 + 4*phi</p><p>which is 339.3 cents.  You can also take the sequence backwards to get</p><p>1 + 5*phi<br/>---------<br/>1 + 4*phi</p><p>Your alternative is</p><p>6 + 5*phi<br/>---------<br/>5 + 4*phi</p><p>or 355.9 cents.  That&apos;s properly described as the shadow between 5/4 and 11/9.  You can see that by replacing phi with 1+1/phi</p><p>6 + 5*(1 + 1/phi)   6 + 5 + 5/phi   11 + 5/phi   11*phi + 5<br/>----------------- = ------------- = ---------- = ----------<br/>5 + 4*(1 + 1/phi)   5 + 4 + 4/phi    9 + 4/phi    9*phi + 4</p><p>It&apos;s also close to your target.  The sequence goes 5/4 11/9 16/13 27/22, ...</p><p>Temperament classes that equate 16:13 and 17:22 may get close to it.  These are interesting because they have neutral triads made of different sized neutral thirds that both have a 13-limit approximation -- 11:9 and 16:13.  It&apos;s one of the simplest ways of accommodating the 13-limit.</p><p>Of course, if you look at enough shadow intervals you can get close to any interval you like.  Same as with just intervals.</p><p>&gt; Either way I have enough information in this thread to publish a book.</p><p>I&apos;ve noticed another thing.  You can think of phi as the shadow between a unison and an octave</p><p>1 + 2*phi   1/phi + 2   1 + phi   1/phi + 1   phi<br/>--------- = --------- = ------- = --------- = ---<br/>1 + phi     1/phi + 1     phi         1        1</p><p>The next simplest shadow within an octave is then logically the one between 2/1 and 3/2.</p><p>2 + phi<br/>-------<br/>1 + phi</p><p>This is 560.1 cents.  A narrow tritone.  As it happens it&apos;s within 2.4 cents of an interval in TOP-RMS magic temperament consisting of 8 descending minor third generators.  It can also be thought of as an approximation to 11:8 but it&apos;s much closer to this shadow interval.  It&apos;s the obvious &quot;characteristic dissonance&quot; that&apos;s big enough to be a consonance but outside the 11-limit.  I was thinking it sounded good despite the large error relative to the 11-limit.  And there I was theorizing that temperament classes like magic were avoiding the shadows by aiming for just intervals...</p><p>Other approximations are in 43- and 45-equal.</p><p>                      Graham</p></div><h3>Carl Lumma &#x3C;carl@...&#x3E;</h3><span>6/12/2008 8:26:51 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Mike wrote:<br/>&gt; Here is the pattern that persisted throughout the whole thread:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; 1) I post some idea that I came up with by applying psychological<br/>&gt; concepts to my conscious experience of microtonal music<br/>&gt; 2) you give me a theory that is well-known and established but,<br/>&gt; on the surface, seems to contradict my experience.

At the time, I had just heard<br/>&gt; for the first time Easley Blackwood&apos;s 17-tet &quot;con moto&quot; work from<br/>his<br/>&gt; Twelve Microtonal Etudes album and found it extraordinarily<br/>beautiful<br/>&gt; in its mood, and immediately set out about finding information as<br/>much<br/>&gt; information on the tuning as I could.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; The only other equal tuning I was familiar with at the time that<br/>&gt; sounded even plausible for western music was 19-tet, which at the<br/>time<br/>&gt; I found to be somewhat unsatisfactory, as the only compositions that<br/>&gt; I&apos;d heard in the tuning sounded at the time really &quot;dirty&quot; and with<br/>a<br/>&gt; very &quot;nervous&quot; feel to them at the time. To put it bluntly, it<br/>sounded<br/>&gt; &quot;out of tune.&quot; Most of my friends who I was trying to get into<br/>&gt; microtonal music felt the same way about it. Either way, we all<br/>&gt; thought the 17-tet piece sounded amazing, particularly with regards<br/>to<br/>&gt; the melody. If anything, it sounded MORE &quot;in tune&quot; than 12-tet,<br/>which<br/>&gt; is more than I could say for 19-tet.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Actually, upon hearing this piece for the first time, I thought that<br/>&gt; perhaps it WAS the much-heralded 19-tet that was so often cited as<br/>&gt; being such an improvement on 12-equal. After I saw that it was<br/>&gt; actually 17-tet (which I had never even heard cited as being<br/>plausible<br/>&gt; for &quot;normal&quot; sounding music before), I started looking up<br/>information<br/>&gt; on it, the only useful information on it really being the paper you<br/>&gt; linked me to.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; This paragraph:<br/>[quoting GS:]<br/>&gt; &quot;In spite of all this, I am forced to admit that, while I do not<br/>find<br/>&gt; the larger semitones of 19-ET, 31-ET, and the meantone temperament<br/>&gt; unacceptable, I still do not perceive them as being as effective<br/>&gt; melodically as those of 12-ET or the Pythagorean tuning.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Instead, I have found that the diatonic scales that are most<br/>&gt; melodically effective are those that have wide fifths, resulting in<br/>&gt; diatonic semitones significantly smaller than those in 12-ET. There<br/>is<br/>&gt; considerable evidence to indicate that I am not alone in making this<br/>&gt; judgment, which serves as a premise upon which the following line of<br/>&gt; reasoning is based.&quot;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Generally did wonders for pointing out things about the temperament<br/>&gt; that I had suspected but lacked a way of articulating. To this day,<br/>&gt; what still bothers me about 19-et is that all of the chord<br/>intervals,<br/>&gt; melodic motions, and chord modulations/root movements are LESS<br/>&gt; articulated than in 12-et. That is, they are all &apos;flatter.&apos; They are<br/>&gt; smaller in distance. There is less movement.</p><p>The diatonic semitone in 19-ET is larger than in 12-ET and much more<br/>so than that of 17-ET.  So there&apos;s actually a greater distance to be<br/>traversed, which one might think of as *more* movement.  But I think<br/>what you&apos;re getting at is that, because of the lower leading tone of<br/>19-ET, the greater distance results in less *attraction* (think of a<br/>sort of tonal gravity) to its resolution to the neighboring tonic.</p><p>But this is true only up to a point: if the leading tone is so high<br/>that it&apos;s only a quartertone (or especially a lesser amount) away,<br/>then the effect is one of less attraction or articulation.  As I<br/>wrote in my 17-tone paper, there&apos;s an optimal value of greatest<br/>attraction somewhere around 70 cents.  Since I wrote the paper, I&apos;ve<br/>concluded that it&apos;s perhaps closer to 67 cents (for an interval<br/>approaching a unison), and probably smaller than that for an interval<br/>approaching an octave.  I had Paul Erlich run a harmonic entropy<br/>curve with the parameters tweaked so that they would agree with some<br/>empirical observations I made many years ago (using a retuned<br/>electronic organ) to identify intervals with maximum dissonance<br/>between a unison and octave with middle C fixed as the lower tone of<br/>the interval.  If I was able to hear (no matter how faintly) the<br/>difference between a rational interval and its slight mistuning, then<br/>that interval would be a point of local minimum on the curve, but if<br/>I was not able, then it would be a local maximum.  The resulting<br/>curve was tweaked so that the global maximum (approaching a unison)<br/>is at 67 cents, which put a local maximum at 1139 cents (approaching<br/>an octave).</p><p>There are more details about this (and also mention of the noble<br/>mediant) here:<br/><a href="http://launch.groups.yahoo.com/group/tuning/messages/73816">http://launch.groups.yahoo.com/group/tuning/messages/73816</a><br/>as well as links to Paul&apos;s and my actual discussion (on the harmonic<br/>entropy group) and to the raw data that resulted.</p><p>&gt; This to me gives me the<br/>&gt; impression of all of the motions being sort of half-assed, e.g.<br/>&gt; they&apos;re &quot;good enough,&quot; but not really good. We don&apos;t have<br/>&gt; C!-&gt;G!-&gt;E!-&gt;B!-&gt;C! but rather c... g... e... b#... *sigh* and the<br/>&gt; like. To be honest, if 19-equal were the dominant tuning system in<br/>&gt; western music, I really suspect that this group would have three<br/>times<br/>&gt; as many members, with most of them extolling the virtues of 12-equal<br/>&gt; as a much more melodic and harmonic alternative.</p><p>I find something rather interesting about 19-ET, that, in spite of<br/>its many advantages -- complete compatibility with conventional<br/>diatonic harmony (excepting 12-ET enharmonic equivalency), no special<br/>symbols required for notation, and membership in many temperament<br/>classes (magic, hanson, keemun, negipent/sept, flattone, liese,<br/>semaphore, sensipent/sept, wurschmidt) -- it continues to engender<br/>strong feelings of acceptance or rejection.  I happen to be among<br/>those who accept it (particularly vs. 22-ET).  Sure, the 7ths are<br/>either much narrower (major and harmonic) or wider (minor) than I<br/>might prefer, but pre-romantic-era music played in 19-ET speaks to me<br/>with a more relaxed mood that seems appropriate to times when life<br/>was simpler and technology progressed at a much slower pace -- as if<br/>I might expect a 19-tone musician, asking how I liked the<br/>performance, to speak Elizabethan English.</p><p>A person from another part of the world who speaks English will<br/>probably pronounce vowels somewhat differently than you prefer, but<br/>that&apos;s part of what makes up &quot;culture&quot;.  If you spend a few weeks in<br/>19-tone land, you may discover (as Ivor Darreg did) that a single<br/>degree of 19 is a melodic interval with a lot of &quot;zonk&quot; that can be<br/>exploited very effectively (e.g., in MOS scales of the magic, hanson,<br/>or keemun generators).</p><p>&gt; On the other hand, I found the melodic movements of 17-et to be<br/>&gt; extremely articulated and as such the piece I keep referring to on<br/>&gt; Blackwood&apos;s album is the one I usually play if I&apos;m only going to<br/>play<br/>&gt; one. I notice now that for the chords, he used a timbre with a bit<br/>of<br/>&gt; chorus/LFO and played extremely staccato chords, presumably to hide<br/>&gt; the beating and out-of-tuneness of the mainly 5-limit thing he seems<br/>&gt; to do with that piece.</p><p>Yes.  When these pieces first came out on vinyl, Erv Wilson and I<br/>listened to them together.  Although we greatly admired Blackwood&apos;s<br/>meticulous craftsmanship, we were a bit disappointed that he adhered<br/>so closely to a major-minor way of thinking.  We found 13 and 23 more<br/>refreshing in that he *had* to do something different.</p><p>&gt; This isn&apos;t to bash 19-tet too much... :) I have grown to like it,<br/>but<br/>&gt; I view it more as some kind of &quot;counterpart&quot; to 17 and to some<br/>extent<br/>&gt; 12. 17 has mainly sharp intervals, 19 has mainly flat intervals, so<br/>&gt; they&apos;re like the difference between night and day. 12 is sort of in<br/>&gt; the middle but closer to 17 with its major third.</p><p>Funny, but I&apos;ve always thought of 12 as closer to 19, because 17 is<br/>the one with all the neutral (11- or 13-prime) intervals.</p><p>&gt; I am very interested though in hearing some of the pieces or musical<br/>&gt; excerpts that you or Margo worked out as you described in your<br/>&gt; paper... If you&apos;ve find harmonic and melodic concepts that sound<br/>&gt; similar to &quot;standard&quot; 5-limit ones, but sound interesting and new at<br/>&gt; the same time, I would certainly like to hear them.</p><p>Yeah, I really should make sound files of all the examples and link<br/>them to the paper.</p><p>&gt; &gt; In case you decide to read the entire paper (or to entice you to<br/>do<br/>&gt; &gt; so), I also made a 17-tone jazz excerpt using the 9-tone scale<br/>&gt; &gt; (subset of 17) that I described near the bottom of the 22nd page<br/>&gt; &gt; (numbered as p. 76):<br/>&gt; &gt; <a href="http://xenharmony.wikispaces.com/space/showimage/17WTjazz.mp3">http://xenharmony.wikispaces.com/space/showimage/17WTjazz.mp3</a><br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Haha, wow. Neutral moondance. Dusk-dance? Twilight perhaps?<br/>Interesting.</p><p>I though it would be good theme music for a TV night-life detective<br/>series.  Although the neutral intervals are unmistakable, the tonic<br/>triad is a 6:7:9 (subminor).  One property of the tuning that I like<br/>is that 6:7:9:11 and 7:9:11:13 (tempered) chords can be transformed<br/>into one another simply by changing the two inner tones.  (There<br/>aren&apos;t many tunings in which 11:12, 12:13, and 13:14 are all<br/>represented by the same interval.)</p><p>&gt; &gt; While we&apos;re on the subject of the psychology of alternative<br/>tunings,<br/>&gt; &gt; there&apos;s a 17-tone piece (by Aaron Krister Johnson) that you might<br/>be<br/>&gt; &gt; interested in listening to, Adagio for Margo, at:<br/>&gt; &gt; <a href="http://www.akjmusic.com/works.html">http://www.akjmusic.com/works.html</a><br/>&gt; &gt; and then read about a particular observation I made:<br/>&gt; &gt; <a href="http://launch.groups.yahoo.com/group/MakeMicroMusic/message/15247">http://launch.groups.yahoo.com/group/MakeMicroMusic/message/15247</a><br/>&gt; &gt; and Aaron&apos;s reply:<br/>&gt; &gt; <a href="http://launch.groups.yahoo.com/group/MakeMicroMusic/message/15249">http://launch.groups.yahoo.com/group/MakeMicroMusic/message/15249</a><br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Yes. Yes. Yes. Exactly. This sentence:<br/>&gt;<br/>[quoting GS again:]<br/>&gt; &quot;In other words, the diatonic system is<br/>&gt; really a musical language, and our success in creating music in<br/>&gt; alternative tunings may depend on our ability to create (or<br/>discover)<br/>&gt; other musical languages that are capable of becoming meaningful to<br/>&gt; the general listener.&quot;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; sums up perfectly everything I was trying to say in that other<br/>thread.<br/>&gt; I&apos;m trying to figure out, as a field of scientific inquiry, how it<br/>&gt; works, how a listener BUILDS this language to begin with, how a<br/>&gt; listener learns expands his language, why listeners sometimes treat<br/>&gt; incoming musical concepts or tunings as &quot;wrong versions&quot; of<br/>something<br/>&gt; else already in their existing language, and how to get them to not<br/>do<br/>&gt; that. I don&apos;t know why I kept getting allegations of my ideas being<br/>&gt; pseudoscientific or misguided in the other thread, but it&apos;s glad to<br/>&gt; finally see someone else thinking along the same lines.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; That being said, I also had some thoughts on this:<br/>&gt;<br/>[quoting GS again:]<br/>&gt; &quot;When we listen to a diatonic composition with only two voice parts<br/>&gt; (such as a Bach two-part keyboard invention), we are able to &quot;hear&quot;<br/>&gt; harmonies that are there only in the sense that they are implied by<br/>&gt; tonal relationships already familiar to both the composer and the<br/>&gt; listener. A two-voice composition in some non-diatonic scale subset<br/>&gt; of a non-12 tuning, on the other hand, would very likely not have<br/>the<br/>&gt; same effect, but would be heard basically as a progression of<br/>&gt; intervals -- unless the composer had first written other<br/>(successful)<br/>&gt; pieces in that scale using full harmonies and the listener had also<br/>&gt; become familiar with them.&quot;</p><p>I was thinking that perhaps folks in the early Middle Ages heard a<br/>two-voice texture without any implied harmonies and that we could<br/>have some idea of what they experienced by listening to two-part<br/>music in a non-diatonic non-12 tuning.</p><p>&gt; I think there are two parts to it:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; 1: the sum-and-difference tones generated by a dyad<br/>&gt; 2: the cognitive labeling of the whole package by the listener<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; For intervals like a perfect fifth, a major third, perfect fourth,<br/>&gt; minor third, etc... The sum and difference tones are quite<br/>pronounced<br/>&gt; and align perfectly in a harmonic series. For intervals like a 9:11<br/>&gt; neutral third, the sum and difference tones are going to be in a<br/>&gt; harmonic series though, but that difference tone will be MUCH lower<br/>&gt; than the chord tones. It will be low enough that if your focus is in<br/>&gt; the midrange where the chord tones are, you might miss this &quot;phantom<br/>&gt; fundamental&quot; virtual tone (even subconsciously).</p><p>Thus I&apos;m rather skeptical that this would be of any influence in 17-<br/>tone for anything other than the 3-limit intervals.</p><p>There&apos;s also the ambiguity of multiple harmonic roles for the various<br/>intervals: is 6deg17 in a 2-voice texture going to be heard as a<br/>tempered 7:9 or 11:14?  Will 15deg (a neutral 6th) be interpreted as<br/>6:11 or 7:13 (or possibly 13:24)?  Will 14deg be 4:7 or 9:16?  It<br/>will have to be determined by the musical context, e.g., the scale<br/>(if any) that the composer is using.</p><p>One reason that I devised 17-tone and 19-tone well-temperaments was<br/>to tweak the intervals by a few cents so as to influence how they&apos;re<br/>more likely to be interpreted in various keys.  One problem with 19-<br/>ET is that 6:7 and 7:8 are represented by the same interval.  For<br/>example, my 19-WT tips the balance in such a way that C:D# sounds<br/>more like 6:7 but D#:F more like 7:8.</p><p>&gt; Once you meditate on<br/>&gt; a neutral triad and grow used to it, however, you start to pick up<br/>on<br/>&gt; the resonance of the chord and hear it in a harmonic context.<br/>However,<br/>&gt; the average listener who hasn&apos;t been accustomed to the sound might<br/>be<br/>&gt; confused and hear it as a mistuned major or minor chord, since<br/>that&apos;s<br/>&gt; the only other thing they have to go by.</p><p>Yep.  That&apos;s why I&apos;ve gravitated toward isoharmonic chords when using<br/>neutral intervals.  They&apos;re consonant in the sense that you can<br/>easily distinguish ones that are in JI from ones that are even<br/>moderately tempered, because disturbances between combinational tones<br/>are minimized.  With 18:22:27, OTOH, there are no prominent beats to<br/>distinguish it from 26:32:39, or from anything in-between.</p><p>&gt; But just like people did eventually get used to the sound of major<br/>&gt; chords and perfect fifths, I think there are probably clever ways to<br/>&gt; find intervals that a listener will most likely hear as new and<br/>novel<br/>&gt; rather than weird and disturbing. For some reason, for people<br/>&gt; accustomed to 12-tet, the 7/6 subminor third is usually such an<br/>&gt; &quot;easy-to-grasp&quot; interval, although a 9/7 supermajor third doesn&apos;t<br/>&gt; share that characteristic and is often heard simply as a sharp 5/4.<br/>&gt; Why this is, I haven&apos;t the foggiest, although it might be<br/>interesting<br/>&gt; to study.</p><p>For 6:7:9 vs. 14:18:21 (same intervals in reverse order), e.g., a lot<br/>of it has to do with the relationships between combinational tones<br/>(particularly first-order difference tones).</p><p>&gt; Furthermore, I hypothesize that just like perfect fifths can be<br/>played<br/>&gt; lower than major thirds and still sound good (due to that phantom<br/>&gt; fundamental dropping off the bottom of hearing range sooner for the<br/>&gt; major thirds), there will be triads that sound muddy straight up<br/>until<br/>&gt; the midrange of the piano, although I don&apos;t know what those triads<br/>are<br/>&gt; yet.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I&apos;m actually running on no sleep right now, so I apologize if any of<br/>&gt; my post didn&apos;t make sense.</p><p>It all makes sense to me -- but take care yourself and get enough<br/>sleep.</p><p>--George</p></div><h3>Dave Keenan &#x3C;d.keenan@...&#x3E;</h3><span>6/12/2008 3:17:43 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;Mike Battaglia&quot; &lt;battaglia01@...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt; What gray/noble/shadow/mystic/double top secret intervals are out<br/>&gt; there that aren&apos;t neutral?

So there&apos;s actually a greater distance to be<br/>&gt; traversed, which one might think of as *more* movement. But I think<br/>&gt; what you&apos;re getting at is that, because of the lower leading tone of<br/>&gt; 19-ET, the greater distance results in less *attraction* (think of a<br/>&gt; sort of tonal gravity) to its resolution to the neighboring tonic.</p><p>Well, I was talking mainly about chordal root movement, which is<br/>usually by fifth. The fifth of 19-tet is so much flatter than 12-tet<br/>that I find the root movement to be a bit &quot;compressed&quot; sounding, as if<br/>it doesn&apos;t move as much as 12&apos;s (because it doesn&apos;t). This could give<br/>a very stagnant or relaxed feel, I suppose, depending on how you look<br/>at it. But I think what I was getting at was what you said - the 15/8<br/>resolving to 2/1 doesn&apos;t work very well, and neither does 19-tet&apos;s<br/>even flatter interval. Perhaps there&apos;s some kind of noble<br/>interval/gray tone that needs to be hit to maximize the effect?</p><p>&gt; But this is true only up to a point: if the leading tone is so high<br/>&gt; that it&apos;s only a quartertone (or especially a lesser amount) away,<br/>&gt; then the effect is one of less attraction or articulation. As I<br/>&gt; wrote in my 17-tone paper, there&apos;s an optimal value of greatest<br/>&gt; attraction somewhere around 70 cents. Since I wrote the paper, I&apos;ve<br/>&gt; concluded that it&apos;s perhaps closer to 67 cents (for an interval<br/>&gt; approaching a unison), and probably smaller than that for an interval<br/>&gt; approaching an octave. I had Paul Erlich run a harmonic entropy<br/>&gt; curve with the parameters tweaked so that they would agree with some<br/>&gt; empirical observations I made many years ago (using a retuned<br/>&gt; electronic organ) to identify intervals with maximum dissonance<br/>&gt; between a unison and octave with middle C fixed as the lower tone of<br/>&gt; the interval. If I was able to hear (no matter how faintly) the<br/>&gt; difference between a rational interval and its slight mistuning, then<br/>&gt; that interval would be a point of local minimum on the curve, but if<br/>&gt; I was not able, then it would be a local maximum. The resulting<br/>&gt; curve was tweaked so that the global maximum (approaching a unison)<br/>&gt; is at 67 cents, which put a local maximum at 1139 cents (approaching<br/>&gt; an octave).<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; There are more details about this (and also mention of the noble<br/>&gt; mediant) here:<br/>&gt; <a href="http://launch.groups.yahoo.com/group/tuning/messages/73816">http://launch.groups.yahoo.com/group/tuning/messages/73816</a><br/>&gt; as well as links to Paul&apos;s and my actual discussion (on the harmonic<br/>&gt; entropy group) and to the raw data that resulted.</p><p>I have to get this harmonic entropy concept down a little bit<br/>better... I&apos;ll read. Thanks.</p><p>&gt;&gt; This to me gives me the<br/>&gt;&gt; impression of all of the motions being sort of half-assed, e.g.<br/>&gt;&gt; they&apos;re &quot;good enough,&quot; but not really good. We don&apos;t have<br/>&gt;&gt; C!-&gt;G!-&gt;E!-&gt;B!-&gt;C! but rather c... g... e... b#... *sigh* and the<br/>&gt;&gt; like. To be honest, if 19-equal were the dominant tuning system in<br/>&gt;&gt; western music, I really suspect that this group would have three<br/>&gt; times<br/>&gt;&gt; as many members, with most of them extolling the virtues of 12-equal<br/>&gt;&gt; as a much more melodic and harmonic alternative.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I find something rather interesting about 19-ET, that, in spite of<br/>&gt; its many advantages -- complete compatibility with conventional<br/>&gt; diatonic harmony (excepting 12-ET enharmonic equivalency), no special<br/>&gt; symbols required for notation, and membership in many temperament<br/>&gt; classes (magic, hanson, keemun, negipent/sept, flattone, liese,<br/>&gt; semaphore, sensipent/sept, wurschmidt) -- it continues to engender<br/>&gt; strong feelings of acceptance or rejection. I happen to be among<br/>&gt; those who accept it (particularly vs. 22-ET). Sure, the 7ths are<br/>&gt; either much narrower (major and harmonic) or wider (minor) than I<br/>&gt; might prefer, but pre-romantic-era music played in 19-ET speaks to me<br/>&gt; with a more relaxed mood that seems appropriate to times when life<br/>&gt; was simpler and technology progressed at a much slower pace -- as if<br/>&gt; I might expect a 19-tone musician, asking how I liked the<br/>&gt; performance, to speak Elizabethan English.</p><p>Oh no, I really like 19-tet. It just took me a while to get used to<br/>it. At first, I thought it sounded... unsettling, and I think it&apos;s<br/>because of the narrow fifths and major thirds, so that chord movements<br/>sounded like they were lacking something. On the other hand, 17-tet&apos;s<br/>wider intervals made it seem like they were &quot;accentuated,&quot; so it was a<br/>big hit right away. That&apos;s the best I can describe it. Nowadays, I<br/>like both 19-tet and 17-tet, and as I said before, I feel like 19-tet<br/>is like the night/day &quot;counterpart&quot; to 12-tet and in some ways 17 as<br/>well.</p><p>&gt; A person from another part of the world who speaks English will<br/>&gt; probably pronounce vowels somewhat differently than you prefer, but<br/>&gt; that&apos;s part of what makes up &quot;culture&quot;. If you spend a few weeks in<br/>&gt; 19-tone land, you may discover (as Ivor Darreg did) that a single<br/>&gt; degree of 19 is a melodic interval with a lot of &quot;zonk&quot; that can be<br/>&gt; exploited very effectively (e.g., in MOS scales of the magic, hanson,<br/>&gt; or keemun generators).</p><p>Yeah, that&apos;s what I&apos;ve come to realize... I personally find that music<br/>written specifically for 19-tet can sound amazing, much better imo<br/>than music written for 12-tet or 1/6 comma meantone or something that<br/>is being &quot;re-done&quot; in 19-tet as an exercise. I haven&apos;t heard any<br/>Renaissance or Baroque-era music in 19-tet, but I can imagine that<br/>that would likely sound pretty decent in 19-tet as well, much better<br/>than say, Debussy or something. Actually, I was listening to<br/>Blackwood&apos;s 19-tet piece off of that album (not the &quot;fanfare&quot; that is<br/>usually attached to the beginning), and up until he goes into<br/>full-blown xenharmonic mode, I can tell why you like the character of<br/>it for that kind of music - it is fairly relaxing.</p><p>I was mainly just describing 17 as potentially a good temperament to<br/>&quot;hook&quot; someone into microtonal music, especially if the chords are<br/>finessed just right so that they don&apos;t sound particularly weird to<br/>someone with a 12-tet vocabulary.</p><p>&gt;&gt; On the other hand, I found the melodic movements of 17-et to be<br/>&gt;&gt; extremely articulated and as such the piece I keep referring to on<br/>&gt;&gt; Blackwood&apos;s album is the one I usually play if I&apos;m only going to<br/>&gt; play<br/>&gt;&gt; one. I notice now that for the chords, he used a timbre with a bit<br/>&gt; of<br/>&gt;&gt; chorus/LFO and played extremely staccato chords, presumably to hide<br/>&gt;&gt; the beating and out-of-tuneness of the mainly 5-limit thing he seems<br/>&gt;&gt; to do with that piece.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Yes. When these pieces first came out on vinyl, Erv Wilson and I<br/>&gt; listened to them together. Although we greatly admired Blackwood&apos;s<br/>&gt; meticulous craftsmanship, we were a bit disappointed that he adhered<br/>&gt; so closely to a major-minor way of thinking. We found 13 and 23 more<br/>&gt; refreshing in that he *had* to do something different.</p><p>The 23-tone one is amazing. I haven&apos;t heard the 13-tone one because I<br/>bought the album off of Napster, and they screwed up and made both of<br/>the tracks the 23-tone one. (Incidentally, if anyone&apos;s feeling<br/>generous today... *cough*)</p><p>&gt;&gt; This isn&apos;t to bash 19-tet too much... :) I have grown to like it,<br/>&gt; but<br/>&gt;&gt; I view it more as some kind of &quot;counterpart&quot; to 17 and to some<br/>&gt; extent<br/>&gt;&gt; 12. 17 has mainly sharp intervals, 19 has mainly flat intervals, so<br/>&gt;&gt; they&apos;re like the difference between night and day. 12 is sort of in<br/>&gt;&gt; the middle but closer to 17 with its major third.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Funny, but I&apos;ve always thought of 12 as closer to 19, because 17 is<br/>&gt; the one with all the neutral (11- or 13-prime) intervals.</p><p>Hm. Maybe you&apos;re right. From a theoretical standpoint, that&apos;s<br/>definitely the case. I just feel like 17 has a &quot;brighter,&quot; more<br/>vibrant feel to it, where as 19 has a more &quot;low-key&quot; and relaxed feel<br/>to it. 12 I feel is more on the vibrant side. How 22 fits into this<br/>setup I don&apos;t know.</p><p>&gt;&gt; I am very interested though in hearing some of the pieces or musical<br/>&gt;&gt; excerpts that you or Margo worked out as you described in your<br/>&gt;&gt; paper... If you&apos;ve find harmonic and melodic concepts that sound<br/>&gt;&gt; similar to &quot;standard&quot; 5-limit ones, but sound interesting and new at<br/>&gt;&gt; the same time, I would certainly like to hear them.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Yeah, I really should make sound files of all the examples and link<br/>&gt; them to the paper.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt; &gt; In case you decide to read the entire paper (or to entice you to<br/>&gt; do<br/>&gt;&gt; &gt; so), I also made a 17-tone jazz excerpt using the 9-tone scale<br/>&gt;&gt; &gt; (subset of 17) that I described near the bottom of the 22nd page<br/>&gt;&gt; &gt; (numbered as p. 76):<br/>&gt;&gt; &gt; <a href="http://xenharmony.wikispaces.com/space/showimage/17WTjazz.mp3">http://xenharmony.wikispaces.com/space/showimage/17WTjazz.mp3</a><br/>&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt; Haha, wow. Neutral moondance. Dusk-dance? Twilight perhaps?<br/>&gt; Interesting.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I though it would be good theme music for a TV night-life detective<br/>&gt; series. Although the neutral intervals are unmistakable, the tonic<br/>&gt; triad is a 6:7:9 (subminor). One property of the tuning that I like<br/>&gt; is that 6:7:9:11 and 7:9:11:13 (tempered) chords can be transformed<br/>&gt; into one another simply by changing the two inner tones. (There<br/>&gt; aren&apos;t many tunings in which 11:12, 12:13, and 13:14 are all<br/>&gt; represented by the same interval.)</p><p>Just out of curiosity, do you have a scala file for this well temperament?</p><p>&gt;&gt; &gt; While we&apos;re on the subject of the psychology of alternative<br/>&gt; tunings,<br/>&gt;&gt; &gt; there&apos;s a 17-tone piece (by Aaron Krister Johnson) that you might<br/>&gt; be<br/>&gt;&gt; &gt; interested in listening to, Adagio for Margo, at:<br/>&gt;&gt; &gt; <a href="http://www.akjmusic.com/works.html">http://www.akjmusic.com/works.html</a><br/>&gt;&gt; &gt; and then read about a particular observation I made:<br/>&gt;&gt; &gt; <a href="http://launch.groups.yahoo.com/group/MakeMicroMusic/message/15247">http://launch.groups.yahoo.com/group/MakeMicroMusic/message/15247</a><br/>&gt;&gt; &gt; and Aaron&apos;s reply:<br/>&gt;&gt; &gt; <a href="http://launch.groups.yahoo.com/group/MakeMicroMusic/message/15249">http://launch.groups.yahoo.com/group/MakeMicroMusic/message/15249</a><br/>&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt; Yes.

I don&apos;t know why I kept getting allegations of my ideas being<br/>&gt;&gt; pseudoscientific or misguided in the other thread, but it&apos;s glad to<br/>&gt;&gt; finally see someone else thinking along the same lines.<br/>&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt; That being said, I also had some thoughts on this:<br/>&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt; [quoting GS again:]<br/>&gt;&gt; &quot;When we listen to a diatonic composition with only two voice parts<br/>&gt;&gt; (such as a Bach two-part keyboard invention), we are able to &quot;hear&quot;<br/>&gt;&gt; harmonies that are there only in the sense that they are implied by<br/>&gt;&gt; tonal relationships already familiar to both the composer and the<br/>&gt;&gt; listener. A two-voice composition in some non-diatonic scale subset<br/>&gt;&gt; of a non-12 tuning, on the other hand, would very likely not have<br/>&gt; the<br/>&gt;&gt; same effect, but would be heard basically as a progression of<br/>&gt;&gt; intervals -- unless the composer had first written other<br/>&gt; (successful)<br/>&gt;&gt; pieces in that scale using full harmonies and the listener had also<br/>&gt;&gt; become familiar with them.&quot;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I was thinking that perhaps folks in the early Middle Ages heard a<br/>&gt; two-voice texture without any implied harmonies and that we could<br/>&gt; have some idea of what they experienced by listening to two-part<br/>&gt; music in a non-diatonic non-12 tuning.</p><p>I find that meditation helps me to get into a state where I -CAN- hear<br/>2-part harmonies that way. It&apos;s not so much that I stop noticing the<br/>harmonic sum and difference tones... It&apos;s more like I stop &quot;filling&quot;<br/>in extra notes or chord qualities mentally. I.E., if I hear C and E<br/>sung simultaneously, I don&apos;t think &quot;this is C major, there is a G in<br/>this triad, on the piano it&apos;s played right here, etc.&quot; I find that<br/>cutting out all of that mental clutter makes it a lot easier to hear<br/>the music for what it is, and I wouldn&apos;t be surprised if many folks<br/>from back in the Middle Ages did in fact notice the sum and difference<br/>tones, and so I&apos;d be on the same page as them in this case.</p><p>&gt;&gt; I think there are two parts to it:<br/>&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt; 1: the sum-and-difference tones generated by a dyad<br/>&gt;&gt; 2: the cognitive labeling of the whole package by the listener<br/>&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt; For intervals like a perfect fifth, a major third, perfect fourth,<br/>&gt;&gt; minor third, etc... The sum and difference tones are quite<br/>&gt; pronounced<br/>&gt;&gt; and align perfectly in a harmonic series. For intervals like a 9:11<br/>&gt;&gt; neutral third, the sum and difference tones are going to be in a<br/>&gt;&gt; harmonic series though, but that difference tone will be MUCH lower<br/>&gt;&gt; than the chord tones. It will be low enough that if your focus is in<br/>&gt;&gt; the midrange where the chord tones are, you might miss this &quot;phantom<br/>&gt;&gt; fundamental&quot; virtual tone (even subconsciously).<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Thus I&apos;m rather skeptical that this would be of any influence in 17-<br/>&gt; tone for anything other than the 3-limit intervals.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; There&apos;s also the ambiguity of multiple harmonic roles for the various<br/>&gt; intervals: is 6deg17 in a 2-voice texture going to be heard as a<br/>&gt; tempered 7:9 or 11:14? Will 15deg (a neutral 6th) be interpreted as<br/>&gt; 6:11 or 7:13 (or possibly 13:24)? Will 14deg be 4:7 or 9:16? It<br/>&gt; will have to be determined by the musical context, e.g., the scale<br/>&gt; (if any) that the composer is using.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; One reason that I devised 17-tone and 19-tone well-temperaments was<br/>&gt; to tweak the intervals by a few cents so as to influence how they&apos;re<br/>&gt; more likely to be interpreted in various keys. One problem with 19-<br/>&gt; ET is that 6:7 and 7:8 are represented by the same interval. For<br/>&gt; example, my 19-WT tips the balance in such a way that C:D# sounds<br/>&gt; more like 6:7 but D#:F more like 7:8.</p><p>I would really like to hear this well temperament. Do you have a scala<br/>file or something of the like for it?</p><p>&gt;&gt; Once you meditate on<br/>&gt;&gt; a neutral triad and grow used to it, however, you start to pick up<br/>&gt; on<br/>&gt;&gt; the resonance of the chord and hear it in a harmonic context.<br/>&gt; However,<br/>&gt;&gt; the average listener who hasn&apos;t been accustomed to the sound might<br/>&gt; be<br/>&gt;&gt; confused and hear it as a mistuned major or minor chord, since<br/>&gt; that&apos;s<br/>&gt;&gt; the only other thing they have to go by.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Yep. That&apos;s why I&apos;ve gravitated toward isoharmonic chords when using<br/>&gt; neutral intervals. They&apos;re consonant in the sense that you can<br/>&gt; easily distinguish ones that are in JI from ones that are even<br/>&gt; moderately tempered, because disturbances between combinational tones<br/>&gt; are minimized. With 18:22:27, OTOH, there are no prominent beats to<br/>&gt; distinguish it from 26:32:39, or from anything in-between.</p><p>Yeah, definitely. Like I was sayin above, I really don&apos;t find 18:22:27<br/>to be of much use unless it&apos;s played at a high enough register that<br/>the &quot;Rameau&quot; tone is perceivable. 9:11:13, on the other hand, doesn&apos;t<br/>have that problem.</p><p>I make an exception for the gray tone between 5/4 and 6/5... At around<br/>356 cents, I find a triad with that and 3/2 in it to serve a musical<br/>function all of its own.</p><p>&gt;&gt; But just like people did eventually get used to the sound of major<br/>&gt;&gt; chords and perfect fifths, I think there are probably clever ways to<br/>&gt;&gt; find intervals that a listener will most likely hear as new and<br/>&gt; novel<br/>&gt;&gt; rather than weird and disturbing. For some reason, for people<br/>&gt;&gt; accustomed to 12-tet, the 7/6 subminor third is usually such an<br/>&gt;&gt; &quot;easy-to-grasp&quot; interval, although a 9/7 supermajor third doesn&apos;t<br/>&gt;&gt; share that characteristic and is often heard simply as a sharp 5/4.<br/>&gt;&gt; Why this is, I haven&apos;t the foggiest, although it might be<br/>&gt; interesting<br/>&gt;&gt; to study.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; For 6:7:9 vs. 14:18:21 (same intervals in reverse order), e.g., a lot<br/>&gt; of it has to do with the relationships between combinational tones<br/>&gt; (particularly first-order difference tones).</p><p>What do you mean here? This seems like precisely the answer I&apos;m looking for.</p><p>&gt;&gt; Furthermore, I hypothesize that just like perfect fifths can be<br/>&gt; played<br/>&gt;&gt; lower than major thirds and still sound good (due to that phantom<br/>&gt;&gt; fundamental dropping off the bottom of hearing range sooner for the<br/>&gt;&gt; major thirds), there will be triads that sound muddy straight up<br/>&gt; until<br/>&gt;&gt; the midrange of the piano, although I don&apos;t know what those triads<br/>&gt; are<br/>&gt;&gt; yet.<br/>&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt; I&apos;m actually running on no sleep right now, so I apologize if any of<br/>&gt;&gt; my post didn&apos;t make sense.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; It all makes sense to me -- but take care yourself and get enough<br/>&gt; sleep.</p><p>Indeed.

With three you have something much closer to entropy and that is &apos;turbulence&apos;.<br/>If the mediants have a strong characteristics that are immediately perceivable ( which must be the case since there are people around the world who tune  to such things)  them there is nothing &apos;uncertain&apos; about them. The notion of lower simpler ratios as a gauge is also still in the background. There are some for instance that find 13 more consonant than 11. and then how does one  quantify these relations without picking some arbitrary formula. The notion also that uncertainly= dissonance is a very equal tempered idea as this is how it manifest itself. Certainly some of Kyle Gann music illustrates that one can be very very dissonant and be very very precise and certain in what is being sounded. I can say that to my ear it can exceed the dissonances of 12 ET. On the other hand not matter how many notes i put down in my 12 note meta slendro, it will not exceed a certain dissonant which in way less that 12 equal, yet the intervals would have to be considered higher in Entropy.</p><p>/^_,&apos;,&apos;,&apos;,_ //^ /Kraig Grady_ ^_,&apos;,&apos;,&apos;,_<br/>Mesotonal Music from:<br/>_&apos;&apos;&apos;&apos;&apos;&apos;&apos;_ ^North/Western Hemisphere:  North American Embassy of Anaphoria Island &lt;<a href="http://anaphoria.com/">http://anaphoria.com/</a>&gt;</p><p>_&apos;&apos;&apos;&apos;&apos;&apos;&apos;_ ^South/Eastern Hemisphere:<br/>Austronesian Outpost of Anaphoria &lt;<a href="http://anaphoriasouth.blogspot.com/">http://anaphoriasouth.blogspot.com/</a>&gt;</p><p>&apos;,&apos;,&apos;,&apos;,&apos;,&apos;,&apos;,&apos;,&apos;,&apos;,&apos;,&apos;,&apos;,&apos;,&apos;,&apos;,&apos;,&apos;,&apos;,&apos;,&apos;,&apos;,&apos;,&apos;,&apos;,&apos;,&apos;,&apos;,&apos;,</p><p>Dave Keenan wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Yes!

This makes sense. But I think that these &quot;fields of<br/>attraction&quot; change depending on what register the interval is in and<br/>depending on how long an interval has been held, to name a few things.</p><p>For example, if you go stay on a major triad for a while, and then go<br/>down to a neutral triad (let&apos;s say that the neutral third is 11/9),<br/>you will likely hear the neutral triad as having more of a &quot;minor&quot;<br/>quality to it than if you just hit that triad out of the blue. But if<br/>you start on 6/5 and go up to the neutral triad, you&apos;ll likely hear it<br/>as having more of a &quot;major&quot; quality to it. You gave a link to the<br/>anchoring effect as an example of why this could be, and it seems<br/>plausible.</p><p>An alternative explanation that I&apos;ve been considering has to do with<br/>the concept of entropy, though possibly not in the same sense as the<br/>harmonic entropy that Paul Erlich wrote about. When you grow used to<br/>that major chord for a while, the amount of &quot;novel information&quot; or<br/>&quot;entropy,&quot; as is defined in information theory, steadily declines from<br/>your first exposure to the chord. When you move to the neutral triad,<br/>you hear motion AWAY from the major triad. What is happening, in<br/>effect, is that the field of attraction around the 5/4 has effectively<br/>DECREASED.</p><p>Try this: Listen to a major triad with the major third sharp at 400<br/>cents. Then drop the major third to an 11/9 at around 350 cents. That<br/>chord will most likely have a very strong &quot;minor&quot; quality to it, as<br/>the entropy of the new minor chord exceeds the entropy of the old<br/>major chord. You are used to the major chord, and so there is no new<br/>information there. There is information coming in when you hit the<br/>neutral triad: that the triad is both &quot;minor and major.&quot; You are used<br/>to the major, and so that field of attraction is redundant - i.e. it<br/>is low entropy. The higher entropy quality that sticks out to you is<br/>the minor quality, which is novel. This effect is accentuated by the<br/>major third being sharp at 400 cents, but it works for the 386 cent<br/>third as well, although you might have to tweak the numbers a bit.</p><p>This works even better in reverse. Listen to a 10:12:15 minor triad<br/>for a minute. Then go up to the 11/9. That 11/9 will likely have a<br/>strong &quot;major&quot; feel to it.</p><p>You said that Rothenburg spoke of this effect in terms of its melodic<br/>sense, and I think it applies to harmony as well. If you feel that the<br/>scale degree has dropped from M3 to m3, it seems, at least in my<br/>perception, to change the quality of the chord you&apos;re on as well,<br/>regardless of the actual just interval.</p><p>This might be due to the anchoring effect or it might not be. It might<br/>be a cognitive bias, or it might be a psychoacoustic phenomenon. I&apos;m<br/>not sure. Either way, the way I see it manifesting itself in the<br/>&quot;fields of attraction&quot; model is to have a time component in which the<br/>field of attraction of an interval decreases over time.</p><p>This leads to a model in which the right &quot;noble&quot; interval to go to to<br/>really hit that neutral, &quot;gray&quot; sound might be entirely different if<br/>you&apos;re going from a major chord to a neutral chord rather than if you<br/>hit the neutral chord right away. I&apos;m not sure how the exact math for<br/>both this and the above time component mentioned would work right now,<br/>especially for the noble interval side of it.</p><p>Also...</p><p>You are likely to perceive an interval much more likely to be a<br/>mistuning of some other interval if it is in a lower register.</p><p>For example, take the 18:22:27 neutral triad again. Play that around<br/>an octave below middle C. For me, the sound of it is, to quote from a<br/>gestalt term, &quot;multistable&quot; - you might hear it flip back and forth<br/>between sounding major and minor. I at least hear it as a flat major<br/>chord mainly, but I can &quot;flip&quot; my perception to hear it as a sharp<br/>minor chord if I try hard enough (or if I play a major chord first).</p><p>Now raise it up 3 octaves. For me, I start to hear it as a neutral<br/>triad, with its own color. It isn&apos;t so much a major and minor chord as<br/>much as it is a NEUTRAL chord in its own right. Just like we&apos;re used<br/>to not being able to play major chords really low on a piano because<br/>they get muddy, we can&apos;t play upper-limit chords too low because they<br/>also get muddy. The only difference is that they start to get muddy<br/>much more quickly. Many musicians intuitively know this from that they<br/>can&apos;t play all kinds of even 12-tet upper chord extensions really low<br/>- but the same thing also applies to simple triads such as the neutral<br/>triad that are upper limit.</p><p>I hypothesize that this has to do with the phantom fundamental of the<br/>chord being below the limit of human hearing -- and the phantom<br/>fundamental of the chord for a major triad is much higher than it is<br/>for the corresponding neutral triad. So there are triads that don&apos;t<br/>become resonant until like the 4th or 5th octave of the piano or so.</p><p>What is happening is that the field of attraction for 11/9 diminishes<br/>as the register drops, and conversely increases as it increases. Below<br/>a certain threshold, the field of attraction for 11/9 will be<br/>nonexistent. Modeling this behavior as well might make for some<br/>interesting results.</p><p>This also makes sense if you listen to a 400-cent 12tet major third on<br/>a piano. When it starts to get low, you really and very obviously hear<br/>it as an out of tune major third. The beating/phantom fundamental<br/>becomes almost untolerable. But as it gets higher, it starts to<br/>develop its own characteristic that is slightly different from a<br/>386-cent major third. The beating has at that point become a<br/>legitimate virtual frequency as it reaches the hearing register - you<br/>can hear it if you try hard enough, and especially if there is<br/>distortion on an instrument playing it. So even irrational intervals<br/>have a phantom fundamental as well.</p><p>&gt;&gt; 5) I give up as I am aware there is no point bickering about<br/>&gt;&gt; what is on or off topic, as you used to moderate and likely<br/>&gt;&gt; get to determine these things. i never get to really explain<br/>&gt;&gt; my idea, give up and am frustrated<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; If you gave up it wasn&apos;t until after you outposted everyone<br/>&gt; else by a wide margin. I don&apos;t get to determine such things<br/>&gt; by the way but I can tell you that this isn&apos;t a gestalt<br/>&gt; psychology mailing list, but that if you have a theory of<br/>&gt; intonation that relies on gestalt psychology you can present<br/>&gt; the theory along with any background you think may be helpful.</p><p>It was never my intent to discuss gestalt psychology just for the hell<br/>of it. I&apos;m currently caught up in this endeavor to understand why the<br/>&quot;end appearance&quot; of a piece music is the way it is for a certain<br/>person. It&apos;s sort of the same approach that is used in the study of<br/>pedagogy: students will have schemas for things, and you as the<br/>teacher have learn how to to build on those schemas in such a way that<br/>students understand you.</p><p>This applies to microtonal music because when I listen to a lot of it,<br/>in terms of what I can digest musically, I don&apos;t like a lot of it<br/>right away. The more I get into it, the more I start to become aware<br/>of what otherwise seems like noise and then I can start to hear it<br/>musically. I also notice with that microtonal pieces that -I- like, my<br/>friends often hear it as &quot;noise&quot; in the same way.</p><p>Furthermore, they hear pieces in 5-limit JI often as &quot;out-of-tune&quot;<br/>versions of pieces in 12-tet. This applies even if they hear just<br/>straight major chords in certain contexts (the major chord will sound<br/>&quot;flat&quot; to them).</p><p>So I&apos;m merely trying to study this issue because I find it<br/>interesting. It isn&apos;t really meant to be about gestalt psychology.<br/>It&apos;s more about the psychology of music, and for this forum, how it<br/>specifically relates to tuning. And for this forum, I mainly asked<br/>questions about how the psychology of music _relates_ to tuning theory<br/>to see if this field has been really explored yet. It has become<br/>apparent to me that in some places it has, and in others it has not.</p><p>&gt;&gt; Most of what you would label the &quot;stratosphere&quot; I would wager are<br/>&gt;&gt; places where I was either first trying to explain a general<br/>&gt;&gt; concept before specifically applying it to music theory or places<br/>&gt;&gt; where I was applying the general concept to music theory before I<br/>&gt;&gt; applied it to tuning theory.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; The places I was thinking of where when you made sweeping calls<br/>&gt; for radical reform that are beyond anyone&apos;s power to implement.</p><p>Then we just disagree on that. I feel strongly that if there were a<br/>formal doctoral thesis on this subject, people would listen. To be<br/>honest, as you know, in academic &quot;music theory/comp&quot; circles many of<br/>the concepts we talk about here are often either unknown or eschewed<br/>in favor of things like &quot;music set theory&quot; and such. Elucidating these<br/>concepts formally might just bring to light things that people don&apos;t<br/>realize, and could very well have a positive effect on the way theory<br/>is taught.</p><p>I can tell you first-hand that music theory is often taught in schools<br/>in a way that contradicts empirical evidence to the contrary. Proof of<br/>this can be found in the fact that people who are often too obsessed<br/>with theory write profoundly unmusical works, as you yourself stated<br/>above. In fact, there are usually two camps: the people who are overly<br/>obsessed with theory, and the people who react strongly enough against<br/>that camp that they &quot;hate all theory.&quot; And then you have those in the<br/>middle who know the theory but acknowledge its flaws. All I propose is<br/>that time be spent on fixing these flaws so that this problem no<br/>longer exists.</p><p>In any field, you will have the teachers who can explain extremely<br/>obtuse concepts, such as the uncountability of the reals or the<br/>Jungian collective unconscious or what have you, in a way that makes<br/>students go &quot;aha!&quot; and realize the insight there for themselves. In<br/>all of my time spent in music education, I have never once heard any<br/>theory concept taught that made me go &quot;aha&quot; and gain any significant<br/>insight into the nature of music or sound. I have mainly gained the<br/>&quot;aha&quot; moments from classes in acoustics/psychoacoustics or from<br/>information I&apos;ve gotten on the internet on tuning theory or from this<br/>very thread. I think that the reason why this is is because common<br/>practice music theory, as it stands and is taught right now, is<br/>basically a mixed up jumble of brilliant psychoacoustic realizations<br/>and &quot;frozen accidents&quot; that are often presented together in a way that<br/>students can&apos;t tell which is which. Furthermore, the frozen accidents<br/>often have fake rules applied to them as if they WERE derived from<br/>some legitimate psychoacoustic or acoustic concept. These rules are<br/>often imposed as gospel and the students are graded on them. It&apos;s no<br/>wonder everyone hates theory.</p><p>Some of the offenders:<br/>1) any concept that treats the diatonic scale as if it were<br/>responsible for music in its entirety<br/>2) any concept that treats music as a function of 12-tet (even IN<br/>12-tet, people don&apos;t think in 12-tet until they&apos;re forced to)<br/>3) any concept that says anything simply just &quot;sounds good&quot; or &quot;sounds bad&quot;<br/>the list could go on for weeks.</p><p>The concepts taught are also usually not applicable to any style of<br/>music except for that common-practice style. So what I was trying to<br/>do in this thread is find a better &quot;core set&quot; of concepts that:</p><p>a) makes intuitive sense (e.g. Aha! moments occur upon hearing them)<br/>b) can be applied to music in all sorts of different styles<br/>c) explain musical things in terms of the EFFECTS they will have (i.e.<br/>a 4:5:6:7:9:11 chord will be strongly resonant) rather than that they<br/>just &quot;sound good&quot; or &quot;sound bad&quot;<br/>d) then, from there, work up to the bigger picture of how priming<br/>effects will play into it, how different things can affect the<br/>perception of a chord/tuning/whatever of a listener (which is where<br/>&quot;gestalt psychology&quot; plays a role), how priming effects basically on a<br/>huge scale ARE what musical context is, and so on.<br/>e) and then from THERE, perhaps tie the whole thing together by<br/>studying how people become accustomed to NEW musical phenomena, and<br/>what might cause them to view new musical phenomena as messed up<br/>versions of OLD musical phenomena. This is what David Rothenburg<br/>studied as it relates to scales, and I find his results fairly<br/>revealing. This general field has a huge application in tuning with<br/>regards to how is taught; e.g. it directly relates to how to best work<br/>students into different tunings, which ones might be logical leaps<br/>after 12-tet, etc. In other words, it relates to workshops like the<br/>one you and I were discussing. I just think Rothenburg&apos;s results are<br/>the tip of the iceberg.</p><p>So I&apos;m trying to tie together a lot of disparate concepts from music<br/>education, acoustics/psychoacoustics, gestalt psychology, music<br/>theory, and so on together to make a better &quot;formalized&quot; music theory<br/>just because the current one legitimately bothers me. Of course, I<br/>can&apos;t do that until I actually figure out why three frequencies in a<br/>10:12:15 triad have the quality to them that they do. Why they make<br/>people feel the way they do. Or, maybe a better way to look at it, is<br/>what IS the feeling of a minor chord? Is it that a minor third is<br/>basically an out of tune major third? What is it?</p><p>So how this all relates back to tuning is that I lack the knowledge of<br/>what this &quot;core set&quot; of principles might be. I&apos;ve gotten a pretty good<br/>starting point from this thread, but with regards to the stuff I<br/>posted above there still seem to be a few holes in what I&apos;ve gotten,<br/>or places where I&apos;m misinterpreting the theory. But we&apos;ll see.</p><p>Hopefully we&apos;re on the same page now though.</p><p>-Mike</p></div><h3>Mike Battaglia &#x3C;battaglia01@...&#x3E;</h3><span>6/13/2008 3:06:56 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>&gt; Very right you are.

This makes sense. But I<br/>&gt; think that these &quot;fields of attraction&quot; change depending on<br/>&gt; what register the interval is in and depending on how long an<br/>&gt; interval has been held, to name a few things.</p><p>If fields of attraction are related to the virtual pitch<br/>mechanism, they should cease to operate in the higher<br/>registers, as groups of neurons responsible for periodicity<br/>counting can only fire up to about 4KHz.</p><p>&gt; For example, if you go stay on a major triad for a while, and<br/>&gt; then go down to a neutral triad (let&apos;s say that the neutral<br/>&gt; third is 11/9), you will likely hear the neutral triad as having<br/>&gt; more of a &quot;minor&quot; quality to it than if you just hit that triad<br/>&gt; out of the blue. But if you start on 6/5 and go up to the neutral<br/>&gt; triad, you&apos;ll likely hear it as having more of a &quot;major&quot; quality<br/>&gt; to it. You gave a link to the anchoring effect as an example of<br/>&gt; why this could be, and it seems plausible.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; An alternative explanation that I&apos;ve been considering has to do<br/>&gt; with the concept of entropy, though possibly not in the same sense<br/>&gt; as the harmonic entropy that Paul Erlich wrote about. When you<br/>&gt; grow used to that major chord for a while, the amount of &quot;novel<br/>&gt; information&quot; or &quot;entropy,&quot; as is defined in information theory,<br/>&gt; steadily declines from your first exposure to the chord. When you<br/>&gt; move to the neutral triad, you hear motion AWAY from the major<br/>&gt; triad. What is happening, in effect, is that the field of<br/>&gt; attraction around the 5/4 has effectively DECREASED.</p><p>That sounds like a plausible explanation for the anchoring effect.<br/>I don&apos;t know if it&apos;s related to fields of attraction.</p><p>&gt; You said that Rothenburg spoke of this effect in terms of its<br/>&gt; melodic sense,</p><p>I did?  I don&apos;t recall anything in Rothenberg about this effect.<br/>How did you make out with the papers btw?</p><p>&gt; You are likely to perceive an interval much more likely to be a<br/>&gt; mistuning of some other interval if it is in a lower register.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; For example, take the 18:22:27 neutral triad again. Play that<br/>&gt; around an octave below middle C. For me, the sound of it is, to<br/>&gt; quote from</p><p>Yeah.</p><p>&gt; I hypothesize that this has to do with the phantom fundamental<br/>&gt; of the chord being below the limit of human hearing</p><p>I don&apos;t think so.  The virtual fundamental will by definition<br/>always be in the range of hearing since it is something we hear.</p><p>&gt; What is happening is that the field of attraction for 11/9<br/>&gt; diminishes as the register drops, and conversely increases as<br/>&gt; it increases.</p><p>What I think: the probability of hearing a neutral triad is<br/>almost always lower than the probability of hearing a major<br/>triad, even if the stimulus is 1/1-11/9-3/2 in JI.  When you<br/>raise the pitch of the stimulus the virtual pitch mechanism<br/>gives up the ghost and you no longer hear the identity of<br/>the triad at all, but instead hear only the lack of roughness,<br/>which is even more of a lack at in register due to the<br/>narrowing of the critical band there.  So roughness dominates<br/>consonance in higher registers.</p><p>&gt; This also makes sense if you listen to a 400-cent 12tet major<br/>&gt; third on a piano. When it starts to get low, you really and<br/>&gt; very obviously hear it as an out of tune major third.  The<br/>&gt; beating/phantom fundamental becomes almost untolerable.</p><p>What&apos;s happening the partials in the complex start to fall<br/>within the critical band, which is quite large in the lower<br/>register.  A just 5/4 has the same problem as 400 cents.</p><p>&gt; Some of the offenders:<br/>&gt; 1) any concept that treats the diatonic scale as if it were<br/>&gt; responsible for music in its entirety<br/>&gt; 2) any concept that treats music as a function of 12-tet (even IN<br/>&gt; 12-tet, people don&apos;t think in 12-tet until they&apos;re forced to)<br/>&gt; 3) any concept that says anything simply just &quot;sounds good&quot; or<br/>&gt; &quot;sounds bad&quot;<br/>&gt; the list could go on for weeks.</p><p>You won&apos;t find many on this list who disagree with you here.</p><p>&gt; Hopefully we&apos;re on the same page now though.</p><p>So far you&apos;ve got me, Dave, and Cameron all telling you to slow<br/>down and study some of the materials you&apos;ve been given.</p><p>I don&apos;t know how old you are, but you sound just like me when<br/>I was 20 -- we&apos;ve got to reform education!

It just took me a while to get used to<br/>&gt; it.</p><p>I agree.  Some tunings sound good right out of the box, but for most<br/>of us it takes some time to get acclimated to the melodic properties<br/>of 19.  Some like it right away, but some others never take to it.</p><p>&gt; At first, I thought it sounded... unsettling, and I think it&apos;s<br/>&gt; because of the narrow fifths and major thirds, so that chord<br/>movements<br/>&gt; sounded like they were lacking something. On the other hand, 17-<br/>tet&apos;s<br/>&gt; wider intervals made it seem like they were &quot;accentuated,&quot; so it<br/>was a<br/>&gt; big hit right away. That&apos;s the best I can describe it. Nowadays, I<br/>&gt; like both 19-tet and 17-tet, and as I said before, I feel like 19-<br/>tet<br/>&gt; is like the night/day &quot;counterpart&quot; to 12-tet and in some ways 17 as<br/>&gt; well.</p><p>I agree.</p><p>&gt; &gt; A person from another part of the world who speaks English will<br/>&gt; &gt; probably pronounce vowels somewhat differently than you prefer,<br/>but<br/>&gt; &gt; that&apos;s part of what makes up &quot;culture&quot;. If you spend a few weeks<br/>in<br/>&gt; &gt; 19-tone land, you may discover (as Ivor Darreg did) that a single<br/>&gt; &gt; degree of 19 is a melodic interval with a lot of &quot;zonk&quot; that can<br/>be<br/>&gt; &gt; exploited very effectively (e.g., in MOS scales of the magic,<br/>hanson,<br/>&gt; &gt; or keemun generators).<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Yeah, that&apos;s what I&apos;ve come to realize... I personally find that<br/>music<br/>&gt; written specifically for 19-tet can sound amazing, much better imo<br/>&gt; than music written for 12-tet or 1/6 comma meantone or something<br/>that<br/>&gt; is being &quot;re-done&quot; in 19-tet as an exercise. I haven&apos;t heard any<br/>&gt; Renaissance or Baroque-era music in 19-tet, but I can imagine that<br/>&gt; that would likely sound pretty decent in 19-tet as well, much better<br/>&gt; than say, Debussy or something.</p><p>Go to:<br/><a href="http://www.akjmusic.com/works.html">http://www.akjmusic.com/works.html</a><br/>and listen to &quot;John Bull - Ut,re,mi,fa,sol,la&quot; (at bottom, right<br/>side), which is in 19-ET.</p><p>&gt; Actually, I was listening to<br/>&gt; Blackwood&apos;s 19-tet piece off of that album (not the &quot;fanfare&quot; that<br/>is<br/>&gt; usually attached to the beginning), and up until he goes into<br/>&gt; full-blown xenharmonic mode, I can tell why you like the character<br/>of<br/>&gt; it for that kind of music - it is fairly relaxing.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I was mainly just describing 17 as potentially a good temperament to<br/>&gt; &quot;hook&quot; someone into microtonal music, especially if the chords are<br/>&gt; finessed just right so that they don&apos;t sound particularly weird to<br/>&gt; someone with a 12-tet vocabulary.</p><p>&gt; &gt;...<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; In case you decide to read the entire paper (or to entice you<br/>to do<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; so), I also made a 17-tone jazz excerpt using the 9-tone scale<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; (subset of 17) that I described near the bottom of the 22nd<br/>page<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; (numbered as p. 76):<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; <a href="http://xenharmony.wikispaces.com/space/showimage/17WTjazz.mp3">http://xenharmony.wikispaces.com/space/showimage/17WTjazz.mp3</a><br/>&gt; &gt;&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt; Haha, wow.

Although the neutral intervals are unmistakable, the tonic<br/>&gt; &gt; triad is a 6:7:9 (subminor). One property of the tuning that I<br/>like<br/>&gt; &gt; is that 6:7:9:11 and 7:9:11:13 (tempered) chords can be<br/>transformed<br/>&gt; &gt; into one another simply by changing the two inner tones. (There<br/>&gt; &gt; aren&apos;t many tunings in which 11:12, 12:13, and 13:14 are all<br/>&gt; &gt; represented by the same interval.)<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Just out of curiosity, do you have a scala file for this well<br/>temperament?</p><p>Yep.

Will 15deg (a neutral 6th) be interpreted<br/>as<br/>&gt; &gt; 6:11 or 7:13 (or possibly 13:24)? Will 14deg be 4:7 or 9:16? It<br/>&gt; &gt; will have to be determined by the musical context, e.g., the scale<br/>&gt; &gt; (if any) that the composer is using.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; One reason that I devised 17-tone and 19-tone well-temperaments<br/>was<br/>&gt; &gt; to tweak the intervals by a few cents so as to influence how<br/>they&apos;re<br/>&gt; &gt; more likely to be interpreted in various keys. One problem with<br/>19-<br/>&gt; &gt; ET is that 6:7 and 7:8 are represented by the same interval. For<br/>&gt; &gt; example, my 19-WT tips the balance in such a way that C:D# sounds<br/>&gt; &gt; more like 6:7 but D#:F more like 7:8.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I would really like to hear this well temperament. Do you have a<br/>scala<br/>&gt; file or something of the like for it?</p><p>! secor_19wt.scl<br/>!<br/>George Secor&apos;s 19-tone proportional-beating (5/17-comma) well<br/>temperament<br/> 19<br/>!<br/>  69.41306<br/> 131.54971<br/> 191.26088<br/> 260.67394<br/> 317.95963<br/> 382.52175<br/> 451.93481<br/> 504.36956<br/> 573.78263<br/> 638.34474<br/> 695.63044<br/> 765.04350<br/> 824.75467<br/> 886.89131<br/> 956.30438<br/>1011.16460<br/>1078.15219<br/>1145.13978<br/>2/1</p><p>&gt; &gt;&gt; Once you meditate on<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt; a neutral triad and grow used to it, however, you start to pick<br/>up on<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt; the resonance of the chord and hear it in a harmonic context.<br/>However,<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt; the average listener who hasn&apos;t been accustomed to the sound<br/>might be<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt; confused and hear it as a mistuned major or minor chord, since<br/>that&apos;s<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt; the only other thing they have to go by.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; Yep. That&apos;s why I&apos;ve gravitated toward isoharmonic chords when<br/>using<br/>&gt; &gt; neutral intervals. They&apos;re consonant in the sense that you can<br/>&gt; &gt; easily distinguish ones that are in JI from ones that are even<br/>&gt; &gt; moderately tempered, because disturbances between combinational<br/>tones<br/>&gt; &gt; are minimized. With 18:22:27, OTOH, there are no prominent beats<br/>to<br/>&gt; &gt; distinguish it from 26:32:39, or from anything in-between.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Yeah, definitely. Like I was sayin above, I really don&apos;t find<br/>18:22:27<br/>&gt; to be of much use unless it&apos;s played at a high enough register that<br/>&gt; the &quot;Rameau&quot; tone is perceivable. 9:11:13, on the other hand,<br/>doesn&apos;t<br/>&gt; have that problem.</p><p>Yes, a higher pitch does make larger-number ratios sound more<br/>consonant.</p><p>&gt; I make an exception for the gray tone between 5/4 and 6/5... At<br/>around<br/>&gt; 356 cents, I find a triad with that and 3/2 in it to serve a musical<br/>&gt; function all of its own.</p><p>That&apos;s a local HE maximum, close to 27/22.</p><p>&gt; &gt;&gt; But just like people did eventually get used to the sound of<br/>major<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt; chords and perfect fifths, I think there are probably clever<br/>ways to<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt; find intervals that a listener will most likely hear as new and<br/>novel<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt; rather than weird and disturbing. For some reason, for people<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt; accustomed to 12-tet, the 7/6 subminor third is usually such an<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt; &quot;easy-to-grasp&quot; interval, although a 9/7 supermajor third doesn&apos;t<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt; share that characteristic and is often heard simply as a sharp<br/>5/4.<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt; Why this is, I haven&apos;t the foggiest, although it might be<br/>interesting<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt; to study.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; For 6:7:9 vs. 14:18:21 (same intervals in reverse order), e.g., a<br/>lot<br/>&gt; &gt; of it has to do with the relationships between combinational tones<br/>&gt; &gt; (particularly first-order difference tones).<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; What do you mean here? This seems like precisely the answer I&apos;m<br/>looking for.</p><p>For 6:7:9 the first order difference tones are 1, 2, and 3.  For<br/>14:18:21 they&apos;re 4, 3, and 7.  The former are in much simpler<br/>relationships to one another than the latter.  Any isoharmonic chord,<br/>e.g. 10:13:16:19 or 18:22:27:32, is going to be distinguishable from<br/>its mistuning, because it&apos;s easy to hear whether or not the first-<br/>order difference tones exactly coincide.  It&apos;s not a matter of<br/>actually hearing the difference tones themselves, but rather that you<br/>can hear a certain smoothness when they coincide and disturbances<br/>(similar to beating) when they don&apos;t.  These aren&apos;t as consonant as<br/>chords with simpler ratios, but they&apos;re musically useful because they<br/>exhibit what I would call difference-tone stabilization.</p><p>&gt; &gt;&gt; Furthermore, I hypothesize that just like perfect fifths can be<br/>played<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt; lower than major thirds and still sound good (due to that phantom<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt; fundamental dropping off the bottom of hearing range sooner for<br/>the<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt; major thirds), there will be triads that sound muddy straight up<br/>until<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt; the midrange of the piano, although I don&apos;t know what those<br/>triads are<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt; yet.</p><p>When you play thirds in the bass range, the beat rate between the<br/>fundamental frequencies is slow enough for the individual beats to be<br/>heard, and it&apos;s the beating that produces the muddiness.</p><p>--George</p></div><h3>Cameron Bobro &#x3C;misterbobro@...&#x3E;</h3><span>6/14/2008 6:17:42 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;Cameron Bobro&quot; &lt;misterbobro@...&gt;</p><p>&gt;<br/>&gt; And now that I&apos;ve seen the Scale Tree of Noble intervals at<br/>&gt; Anaphoria, and even know what it is, I went through and find this:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Scale Tree    252.005 cents     252.005<br/>&gt; Ginkgo        81/70             252.680<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Ginkgo        729/560           456.590<br/>&gt; Scale Tree    457.610 cents     457.610<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Ginkgo        146/105           570.695<br/>&gt; Scale Tree    570.746 cents     570.746<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Ginkgo        219/140           774.605<br/>&gt; Scale Tree    774.732 cents     774.732<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Ginkgo        105/64            857.095 septimal neutral sixth<br/>&gt; Scale Tree    857.210 cents     857.210<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Scale Tree    954.613 cents     954.613<br/>&gt; Ginkgo        243/140           954.635<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; and<br/>&gt;  73/70             72.650  4/3 below the 146/105<br/>&gt;  35/32            155.140  3/2 below the 105/64</p><p>Correction on the last two.

For this<br/>purpose the denominators of the ratios can be read as -EDOs, and the<br/>numerator as the number of degrees of that EDO that the generator<br/>corresponds to.</p><p>But I severely doubt that all of the given 256 noble frequency ratios<br/>are audibly shadowy or gray.</p><p>For a noble number to correspond to a shadow interval, I think it has<br/>to be the noble mediant of two just intervals, i.e. two intervals that<br/>can be tuned by ear through the locking-in of partials, i.e. two<br/>ratios which are sufficiently simple, say n*d &lt;= 120. So I&apos;d expect<br/>maybe only about 20 of the simplest nobles to correspond to shadow<br/>regions, within the octave.</p><p>In other words, I&apos;d suggest only those nobles whose dashed lines<br/>originate from blobs above about level 7 of the scale tree (the level<br/>containing 7/6 11/9 14/11 13/10 15/11 18/13 17/12 13/9 19/12 21/13<br/>18/11 17/10 19/11 16/9 11/6). That&apos;s only one more level than is shown<br/>on page 1. Except that close to the unison and octave you might go<br/>down another level or two.</p><p>I note that there is no point in restricting ourselves to the first<br/>octave when calculating nobles that may correspond to shadow<br/>intervals. The octave extensions and inversions of noble numbers are<br/>not (in general) noble numbers. The noble numbers above 2/1 are quite<br/>independent of those below.</p><p>Your calculation of the noble mediant of 1/1 and 11/10 below is quite<br/>correct. It is also the noble mediant of 11/10 and 12/11.</p><p>However something must have gone wrong in your calculation of the<br/>phi-weighted mediant of 11/10 and 23/22 since your result is not even<br/>between those two ratios.</p><p>I say &quot;phi-weighted mediant&quot; because in this case, even the correct<br/>result does not correspond to a noble number. You can see this by<br/>applying the cross-multiplication check I mentioned. 11*22 = 242,<br/>10*23 = 230.

For this<br/>&gt; purpose the denominators of the ratios can be read as -EDOs, and the<br/>&gt; numerator as the number of degrees of that EDO that the generator<br/>&gt; corresponds to.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; But I severely doubt that all of the given 256 noble frequency ratios<br/>&gt; are audibly shadowy or gray.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; For a noble number to correspond to a shadow interval, I think it has<br/>&gt; to be the noble mediant of two just intervals, i.e. two intervals that<br/>&gt; can be tuned by ear through the locking-in of partials, i.e. two<br/>&gt; ratios which are sufficiently simple, say n*d &lt;= 120. So I&apos;d expect<br/>&gt; maybe only about 20 of the simplest nobles to correspond to shadow<br/>&gt; regions, within the octave.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; In other words, I&apos;d suggest only those nobles whose dashed lines<br/>&gt; originate from blobs above about level 7 of the scale tree (the level<br/>&gt; containing 7/6 11/9 14/11 13/10 15/11 18/13 17/12 13/9 19/12 21/13<br/>&gt; 18/11 17/10 19/11 16/9 11/6). That&apos;s only one more level than is shown<br/>&gt; on page 1. Except that close to the unison and octave you might go<br/>&gt; down another level or two.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I note that there is no point in restricting ourselves to the first<br/>&gt; octave when calculating nobles that may correspond to shadow<br/>&gt; intervals. The octave extensions and inversions of noble numbers are<br/>&gt; not (in general) noble numbers. The noble numbers above 2/1 are quite<br/>&gt; independent of those below.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Your calculation of the noble mediant of 1/1 and 11/10 below is quite<br/>&gt; correct. It is also the noble mediant of 11/10 and 12/11.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; However something must have gone wrong in your calculation of the<br/>&gt; phi-weighted mediant of 11/10 and 23/22 since your result is not even<br/>&gt; between those two ratios.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I say &quot;phi-weighted mediant&quot; because in this case, even the correct<br/>&gt; result does not correspond to a noble number. You can see this by<br/>&gt; applying the cross-multiplication check I mentioned. 11*22 = 242,<br/>&gt; 10*23 = 230. They differ by more than 1, so this is not noble.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; To get an idea of which nobles might be shadows, I suggest looking at<br/>&gt; this Harmonic Entropy chart that Paul Erlich calculated based on<br/>&gt; George Secor&apos;s requirements.<br/>&gt; <a href="http://launch.groups.yahoo.com/group/harmonic_entropy/files/dyadic/secor4.gif">http://launch.groups.yahoo.com/group/harmonic_entropy/files/dyadic/secor4.gif</a> &gt; &lt;<a href="http://launch.groups.yahoo.com/group/harmonic_entropy/files/dyadic/secor4.gif">http://launch.groups.yahoo.com/group/harmonic_entropy/files/dyadic/secor4.gif</a>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; The data for this is in an Excel spreadsheet at<br/>&gt; <a href="http://launch.groups.yahoo.com/group/harmonic_entropy/files/Secor/raw-entr.xls">http://launch.groups.yahoo.com/group/harmonic_entropy/files/Secor/raw-entr.xls</a> &gt; &lt;<a href="http://launch.groups.yahoo.com/group/harmonic_entropy/files/Secor/raw-entr.xls">http://launch.groups.yahoo.com/group/harmonic_entropy/files/Secor/raw-entr.xls</a>&gt;<br/>&gt; with the maxima (to the nearest cent) labelled, and the minima<br/>&gt; labelled with their ratios.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Of course the ears must be the final arbiter, but I don&apos;t find that<br/>&gt; any of the Ginkgo intervals from the 1/1 are &quot;explained&quot; by the noble<br/>&gt; numbers you gave, as these are too complex.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; -- Dave Keenan<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; --- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a> &lt;mailto:tuning%<a href="http://40yahoogroups.com">40yahoogroups.com</a>&gt;, &gt; &quot;Cameron Bobro&quot; &lt;misterbobro@...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; --- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a> &lt;mailto:tuning%<a href="http://40yahoogroups.com">40yahoogroups.com</a>&gt;, &gt; &quot;Cameron Bobro&quot; &lt;misterbobro@&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; And now that I&apos;ve seen the Scale Tree of Noble intervals at<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; Anaphoria, and even know what it is, I went through and find this:<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; Scale Tree 252.005 cents 252.005<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; Ginkgo 81/70 252.680<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; Ginkgo 729/560 456.590<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; Scale Tree 457.610 cents 457.610<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; Ginkgo 146/105 570.695<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; Scale Tree 570.746 cents 570.746<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; Ginkgo 219/140 774.605<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; Scale Tree 774.732 cents 774.732<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; Ginkgo 105/64 857.095 septimal neutral sixth<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; Scale Tree 857.210 cents 857.210<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; Scale Tree 954.613 cents 954.613<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; Ginkgo 243/140 954.635<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; and<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; 73/70 72.650 4/3 below the 146/105<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; 35/32 155.140 3/2 below the 105/64<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; Correction on the last two.

For this<br/>&gt; &gt; purpose the denominators of the ratios can be read as -EDOs, and the<br/>&gt; &gt; numerator as the number of degrees of that EDO that the generator<br/>&gt; &gt; corresponds to.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; But I severely doubt that all of the given 256 noble frequency &gt; ratios<br/>&gt; &gt; are audibly shadowy or gray.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; For a noble number to correspond to a shadow interval, I think it &gt; has<br/>&gt; &gt; to be the noble mediant of two just intervals, i.e. two intervals &gt; that<br/>&gt; &gt; can be tuned by ear through the locking-in of partials, i.e. two<br/>&gt; &gt; ratios which are sufficiently simple, say n*d &lt;= 120. So I&apos;d expect<br/>&gt; &gt; maybe only about 20 of the simplest nobles to correspond to shadow<br/>&gt; &gt; regions, within the octave.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; In other words, I&apos;d suggest only those nobles whose dashed lines<br/>&gt; &gt; originate from blobs above about level 7 of the scale tree (the &gt; level<br/>&gt; &gt; containing 7/6 11/9 14/11 13/10 15/11 18/13 17/12 13/9 19/12 21/13<br/>&gt; &gt; 18/11 17/10 19/11 16/9 11/6).

The octave extensions and inversions of noble numbers are<br/>&gt; &gt; not (in general) noble numbers. The noble numbers above 2/1 are &gt; quite<br/>&gt; &gt; independent of those below.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; Your calculation of the noble mediant of 1/1 and 11/10 below is &gt; quite<br/>&gt; &gt; correct. It is also the noble mediant of 11/10 and 12/11.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; However something must have gone wrong in your calculation of the<br/>&gt; &gt; phi-weighted mediant of 11/10 and 23/22 since your result is not &gt; even<br/>&gt; &gt; between those two ratios.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; I say &quot;phi-weighted mediant&quot; because in this case, even the correct<br/>&gt; &gt; result does not correspond to a noble number.

And what&apos;s potentially interesting on it, is that<br/>the method is one i came up with quite a while ago (back in the late<br/>90s on these lists) but didn&apos;t really fully notice it as i was using<br/>the method to convert EDOs to frequency ratio series by bending<br/>overtone and undertone series towards a median series. Anyway, the<br/>method, while giving similar results, is quite different from those<br/>that are usually cited--i.e, Helmholtz,Partch, Erlich&apos;s HE etc. The<br/>results are similar, though perhaps even more &quot;conservative&quot; than you<br/>suggest in this post.<br/>take care, daniel</p><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;Dave Keenan&quot; &lt;d.keenan@...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Hi Cameron,<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Thanks for inviting me to check your numbers.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Those you have read from<br/>&gt; <a href="http://www.anaphoria.com/sctree.PDF">http://www.anaphoria.com/sctree.PDF</a><br/>&gt; you have correctly converted to cents.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; However, we should note that Erv&apos;s scale-tree gives 256 noble<br/>numbers<br/>&gt; within the octave, so on average they are only 4.7 cents apart, and<br/>&gt; therefore you will always find one of these noble numbers within a<br/>few<br/>&gt; cents of almost anything.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; You can go on adding more levels to the scale-tree indefinitely,<br/>&gt; doubling the number of nobles each time.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Erv probably took the tree out to 11 levels<br/>&gt; (a) to include 11/10 for use as a frequency ratio, and<br/>&gt; (b) for the tree&apos;s other use, in finding scale generators.

At precisely which level of complexity this will occur is, most immediately, an issue of compositional context; that is to say that it is up to the composer to find ways in which intervals project their identities distinctively or ambiguously (and yes, composers do choose ambiguity over clarity when musically appropriate).  Density of musical texture, tempo, amplitude, registration/timbre/orchestration: all of these elements can affect the use and perception of intervals.</p><p>Previously, in a slightly different context, I characterized the field of possible intervals as something like the burning map of the Ponderosa: we know that there&apos;s an edge beyond which distinctions are burnt up, either no longer musically meaningful or meaningful only in costly musical environments.  Much of our hesistancy to precisely define just intonation is located along this edge: the set of all ratios is obviously too large, and the set of ratios of small whole numbers, while better, begs for a definition of &quot;small&quot; that is not immediately forthcoming.  Research (particularly recent work in the neuroscience of music) gives some hints about the location of this edge, as well as the body of experience represented by real, existing musics, but for all practical purposes, the precise location of that edge is not determined, except through composition, and composers have shown some invention in creating contexts in which the usable field of intervals can be increased.</p><p>I&apos;m not a platonist, so I&apos;m not ready to accept the notion that the proportions of real, existing music are the shadows of ideal ratios located wherever ideals go to play.  I&apos;m inclined to a definition of just intonation based upon the real experience of tuning: a just interval is a target real musicians in a tuning process and -- pace La Monte Young, pace Fourier -- accuracy is a function of time, reduction of interference beating to local minima and contextual signals -- like the presence of consonant combination tones - can be important to our evaluation of an interval, and finally, give intervals (and the musicians who produce them) the benefit of both a doubt and a nod to Ockham: Frustra fit per plura quod potest fieri per paucior.</p><p>djw<br/><a href="http://renewablemusic.blogspot.com/">http://renewablemusic.blogspot.com/</a></p></div><h3>Dave Keenan &#x3C;d.keenan@...&#x3E;</h3><span>6/16/2008 2:50:05 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, Kraig Grady &lt;kraiggrady@...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; i seem to be &quot;diverging&quot; from it quite greatly!:)</p><p>Kraig,</p><p>I completely fail to understand why you say that.

I think in some ways metastability is<br/>already achieved without phi weighting--so long as you allow that the<br/>more complex a ratio is (the larger its numbers) the higher it sits<br/>in relation to its more stable-state neighbors. Though as an aside, I<br/>do think phi-weighting is the best way to go to define generators for<br/>all 2 step-size scales... that seems like a perfect generalization to<br/>me, and same for other metallic-constants to define step sizes for<br/>other scales of more than two step-sizes.</p><p>Anyway, what I was trying to do in the earlier White Knife post was<br/>to model span in a simple rule-of-thumb way, like N*D, the product of<br/>the numerator and the denominator for height. Envisioning spanhow<br/>wide a given ratio might bemight allow one to model those places<br/>where intervals cross into each other&apos;s field of attraction leading<br/>to ambiguity.
