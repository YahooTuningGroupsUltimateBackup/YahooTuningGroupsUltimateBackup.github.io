Once you&apos;ve done a<br/>&gt;few guitars, is there anything unexpectedly tricky on a mandolin refret<br/>&gt;job?</p><p>OK, well I didn&apos;t do the work myself, and it was &quot;doubletwelvulated&quot;<br/>rather than &quot;detwelvulated&quot;, but I did have seven frets added to a<br/>mandolin so that I could play 24TET in first position (beyond first<br/>position the frets would have been too close together for me to play).</p><p>The guy who did the work had two concerns:</p><p>1. He didn&apos;t want to damage the &quot;binding&quot; (I forget if that&apos;s the term<br/>   he used) on either side of the fret-board (the white stuff on both<br/>   sides of the fretboard in the photos below).</p><p>   <a href="http://cjchapm.home.mindspring.com/Mandolin01.JPG">http://cjchapm.home.mindspring.com/Mandolin01.JPG</a><br/>   <a href="http://cjchapm.home.mindspring.com/Mandolin02.JPG">http://cjchapm.home.mindspring.com/Mandolin02.JPG</a></p><p>2. For some reason that is not clear to me, I think he was also worried<br/>   about cracking or breaking the wood in the fretboard.</p><p>What he ended up doing was filing off the tangs of the frets that he<br/>added and gluing them on.  They have held up thus far, but I do intend<br/>to use someone more experienced at this sort of thing for my next<br/>project.  :-)</p><p>Cheers,<br/>Christopher</p></div>
