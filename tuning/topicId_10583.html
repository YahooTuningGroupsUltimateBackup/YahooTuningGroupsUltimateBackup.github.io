He was obviously a person who didn&apos;t like a lot of<br/>distracting influences -- maybe a kind of modern Thoreau??  I was<br/>particularly fascinated by the following quote, which accompanies the<br/>Combination Product Set document we have recently been studying on the<br/>list:</p><p><a href="http://www.anaphoria.com/dal01.html">http://www.anaphoria.com/dal01.html</a></p><p>Erv Wilson:</p><p>&quot;A keyboard program that embodies all of the Combination Product Sets on<br/>the bottom row of figures 3 &amp; 19 was accomplished by September 1974,<br/>from my adobe house in Pacheco, Chihuahua, and mailed by pony to John<br/>Chalmers for Xenharmonicon II...&quot;</p><p>Now there&apos;s a man who doesn&apos;t want excessive external influences!<br/>Forget e-mail...
