When you compoare it to<br/>&gt; others though, you realize how special the set is!  The interval vector<br/>&gt; tells us the interval content of a set, but also the common notes under<br/>&gt; transposition of that set.  The diatonic Interval Vector shows us that there<br/>&gt; is a hierarchy among its transpositions.  You can transpose the scale by a<br/>&gt; perfect fifth everytime and retain all tones but one.</p><p>I don&apos;t know quite what you mean here. Any transposable system shares all<br/>but one note with its neighboring key. Perhaps you mean that the seven note<br/>system is the only one that does it at the best approximation of 3/2 or<br/>4/3? But there are other non-seven note systems that do this. One of the<br/>many trees of transposable scales (which have real names that I&apos;m still<br/>learning) includes</p><p>                       L                (L = 2)<br/>                L            s          (L ~ 3/2)<br/>           L         s       L          (L ~ 4/3)<br/>        L     s      s    L      s      (Ls ~ 4/3)<br/>      L   s   L      L   L  s    L      (LLs ~ 4/3)<br/>    L  s  s  L s    L s L s s   L s     (LssLs ~ 4/3)</p><p>and we can do this forever. So if you are saying that the diatonic is<br/>special because it is the only 7-note scale which transposes at the<br/>fifth, then there are many systems which are unique because they<br/>&quot;are the only n-tone system that transposes at the Q&quot; (substitute n<br/>and Q as appropriate).</p><p>Thats somewhat in jest, I am a &quot;small integer ratio&quot; kinda guy, so<br/>transposing at the 3/2 seems like a &quot;good thing&quot;, nonetheless, it<br/>doesn&apos;t pick &quot;7&quot; out of this tree more than &quot;5&quot; (pentatonic, also<br/>quite popular), or 17 or 19 (the next choices on the way to forever).</p><p>Bob Valentine</p></div>
