And I, not being a physicist, have to be REAL careful with this<br/>one so that it doesn&apos;t come off sounding less like a music-math-physics<br/>connection and more like New Age gibberish.  So the following is all with<br/>the caveat: &quot;as far as I understand it&quot; and you can read the real story in<br/>the pages of the Journal of Mathematical Physics.</p><p>I&apos;m still hazy about exactly what KIND of microphysical systems Douthett<br/>et al have applied maximal evenness to.  Like many laymen, I have<br/>difficulty dealing with abstract physical models -- I always want a<br/>picture.  Anyway, here goes....</p><p>The official area of physics this falls into is, within the physics trade,<br/>actually called &quot;statistical physics&quot; as applied to large numbers of<br/>particles displaying certain kinds of &quot;behaviors.&quot;  (Big tongue in cheek<br/>on that last word, pace Jonjoe McFadden -- in this case &quot;behavior&quot;<br/>involves the &quot;pairwise interaction of spins on a lattice.&quot;)  You&apos;ll recall<br/>that in the 1991 Clough &amp; Douthett article in JMT, they use a conceptual<br/>model of ME that asks you to imagine a given number of electrons (say 7)<br/>positioned in the same orbit and which are allowed only certain locations<br/>(say 12).  If, after placing one of the electrons at an &quot;allowed&quot; location<br/>on the circular orbit, you are required to place the others &quot;in such a way<br/>that the charge equilibrium is disturbed as little as possible,&quot; you get<br/>the good old ME pattern 2212221.</p><p>When I first read that, my reaction was really no more than &quot;that&apos;s a<br/>great analogy.&quot;  Sure, I did some idle (novice) daydreaming about<br/>deBroglie&apos;s insight from the quantization of vibrating strings, and<br/>wouldn&apos;t it be cool if, and so on.  For a non-physicist this is<br/>Gurdjieff-Ouspensky stuff (irony intended).  But I thought there couldn&apos;t<br/>possibly be any REAL connection between a culturally and historically<br/>ubiquitous scale structure and the behavior of charged particles via a<br/>common mathematics.  I was wrong.</p><p>Although I heard about it earlier than the first published article, I<br/>think it&apos;s fair to say that the official birth of maximal evenness as a<br/>mathematical model useful to physics came with the article entitled<br/>&quot;Energy extremes and spin configurations for the one-dimensional<br/>antiferromagnetic Ising model with arbitrary-range interaction,&quot; by Jack<br/>Douthett and Richard Krantz, published in Journal of Mathematical Physics<br/>37 (7), July 1996, pp.3334-53.  I also have a copy of Douthett&apos;s<br/>Dissertation (University of New Mexico, 1999) entitled &quot;The Theory of<br/>Maximally and Minimally Even Sets, the One-Dimensional Antiferromagnetic<br/>Ising Model, and the Continued Fraction Compromise of Musical Scales.&quot;<br/>I&apos;ve been told that Douthett continues to work with Krantz and other<br/>physicists on applications, and I believe at least one other article has<br/>come out in J.Math.Phys.  I think last summer Clough and Douthett made a<br/>&quot;pop version&quot; presentation of all this at the Bridges Conference in<br/>Kansas, and they have a version coming out in a general interest science<br/>journal soon.</p><p>In a nutshell, that&apos;s all I know (or think I know) right now.  While I<br/>continue to avoid jumping to conclusions about all this (as I would advise<br/>everyone to do), nevertheless this connection makes me want to visit every<br/>school board across the nation and ask them, in a not very polite way,<br/>&quot;Could you remind me once more why math and science are more important<br/>than the arts?&quot;</p><p>In this case at least, music has trumped physics in getting to the math<br/>first.</p><p>Best,</p><p>Steve</p></div><h3>Stephen Soderberg &#x3C;SSOD@LOC.GOV&#x3E;</h3><span>4/17/2001 7:01:11 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>A PS to my comments about the music-math-physics connection of Douthett et<br/>al:</p><p>Music theory&apos;s interval-class vectors also figure prominently in the<br/>J.Math.Phys. article I cited.
