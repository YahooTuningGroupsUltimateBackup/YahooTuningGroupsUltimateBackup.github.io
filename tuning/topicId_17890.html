Coming from someone who is intimately familiar with, and clearly<br/>loves, grand pianos, this is a powerful statement!  Where can I learn<br/>more about these?&gt;&gt;</p><p> you can learn just about all you need to know about pedal steel guitars with<br/>a case of beer with a dirty redhead in a clean Corvette.  Just find the<br/>nearest country dive that has had the same band for three years and spend<br/>half a lifetime in there.  By the time you know the words to most of Tammy<br/>and George, you&apos;ll have the pedal steel all figured out.</p><p>&gt;&gt;Well, since for relative tuning changes, each string set (1, 2, or 3<br/>strings at each particular pitch) would have to have its own mechanism,<br/>and since the whole process would probably have to be computer<br/>controlled, the combination of relative tuning and absolute tuning would<br/>all flow through the computer and individual servo mechanisms for each<br/>pitch, so your basic idea is just fine.  I even imagine on-the-fly<br/>sensing of the pitch achieved, and corrections for deviations from the<br/>expected.&lt;&lt;</p><p>  The pedal steel works by strings having their tension changed via a<br/>rotating anchor.  This would be hard to do with a piano, where the strings<br/>carry approx 170 lbs each,( that means over 400 lbs per note!)  I think you<br/>could have cams forming the terminus of the individual notes, but the<br/>strength involved would be considerable.  These cams could rotate against the<br/>wire as dictated by a computer that knows when to go sharp or flat.  Need<br/>some type of lubrication,maybe that beer and redhead.......<br/>  Hell,  we could go back to the bebung of the clavichord and the player<br/>would just have to intonate to JI at will.

Your suggestion is interesting but probably impractical<br/>for me (I seem to remember a clause in my marriage contract regarding<br/>dirty redheads in clean Corvettes, and if I&apos;m not mistaken, they&apos;re off<br/>limits).</p><p>&gt;The pedal steel works by strings having their tension changed via a<br/>&gt;rotating anchor.

The guitar has many fewer strings and<br/>much less tension per string.</p><p>&gt;Hell,  we could go back to the bebung of the clavichord and the player<br/>&gt;would just have to intonate to JI at will.  With electronic<br/>&gt;amplification, the clavichord just might be the ultimate JI instrument.</p><p>The clavichord can only be bent upward in pitch, and controlling the<br/>intonation by key pressure seems less than ideal.  Also, the tone of<br/>the clavichord is inferior to the piano, IMHO.  And if we&apos;re going to<br/>introduce amplification, why not go totally electronic?  Other than<br/>that, I like the idea.  ;-&gt;</p><p>JdL</p></div>
