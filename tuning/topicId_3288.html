Get well! I hope you are feeling better already.</p><p>I have a camphylobacter infection but I am up and about.</p><p>&gt; I&apos;ve always thought that HP merely took Helmholtz&apos;s first octave curve,<br/>&gt; smoothed it a bit, then reflected it about the horizontal axes and<br/>&gt; rotated the result.</p><p>The derivation of Partch&apos;s one-footed bride is clear. For each of his 43 intervals constructed on 1/1,<br/>he assigned a level of consonance inversely related to the ODD LIMIT, except that intervals whose odd<br/>limit exceeded 11 were all given an equal, lowest-possible consonance rating. He then connected the<br/>consonance points with a smooth curve. The graph is but one piece of evidence of Partch&apos;s odd-limit<br/>thinking that goes criminally unnoticed by all the prime enthusiasts, including Partch&apos;s biographer, Bob<br/>Gilmore.</p><p>-Paul</p></div><h3><a id=3312 href="#3312">ðŸ”—</a>Jonathan M.

Instead, he should make none at all.</p><p>IYHO.</p><p>I agree with your later statement that you &quot;don&apos;t think any of this is too<br/>important&quot;. What is important are the implications of a public discourse.<br/>So frequently it kills me, when plain ASCII email fails to convey either<br/>humorous or serious nature, or both at once. I was being a bit &apos;light&apos;,<br/>though my message was in earnest. Therefore...</p><p>Hey, anyone can make an erroneous statement. It&apos;s part of human nature. You<br/>might be overlooking the fact that while some element of intonational<br/>theory may be clear to you, Paul, I looked back and realized that the<br/>original point was one that was &quot;opaque&quot; to none other than John Chalmers,<br/>who I don&apos;t exactly consider a babe in the woods concerning intonation and<br/>tuning. I stand by my point: it&apos;s a *biography*, and if there may be a<br/>disagreement over what *you* consider a critically mis-reported truism,<br/>when looked at in it&apos;s entirety I find the book passes muster quite easily.</p><p>&gt;Exactly -- I won&apos;t mention it, rather than making an erroneous statement<br/>&gt;about it.</p><p>I look forward to the day that you can confidently publish all material, in<br/>perpetuity, glowing in the knowledge you&apos;ll never make an erroneous statement.</p><p>&gt;important, though in the tone of your reaction I sense that I hit an<br/>&gt;emotional nerve of some sort.</p><p>No, not really. Just the difficulties of communicating in this medium. Of<br/>course, I care much more about this subject matter, in the large, than many<br/>other issues. Numbers don&apos;t thrill me, but that is just me. My main point<br/>was the rather out-of-hand rejection you implied, even though you were<br/>attaching it to an admittedly unimportant point. But...</p><p>&gt;I&apos;ve heard some very negative reactions to the Gilmore book from a lot of<br/>&gt;Partchophiles, though in my state of blissful ingorance as to the true<br/>number<br/>&gt;of sock-changes I enjoyed it thoroughly. What&apos;s your feeling?</p><p>I&apos;d be curious as to what you consider a Partch person. I can&apos;t say I<br/>enjoyed it, since it is a fairly sobering chronicle of a none-too-happy<br/>life. BUT -- in one fell swoop, the book shed about 90% more light on the<br/>life of a major composer, complete with details unknown before it&apos;s<br/>publication, than had existed previously. There are contacts and<br/>information that might well have disappeared had someone not gotten on to<br/>it. And the irony is not lost on me that this kind of work hadn&apos;t been<br/>attempted by any *American* author. I happen to think it is a very<br/>important work, &quot;erroneous statements&quot; and all.</p><p>Look, I&apos;ve known Bob Gilmore for years, I&apos;ve done a seminar on Partch with<br/>him, we&apos;ve worked together on projects. I want that clear. But that is not<br/>why I called you on that statement.</p><p>And...if you&apos;d like to write a succinct rebuttal or clarification of the<br/>issue of Helmholtz/Partch ideas of consonance and dissonance, I have a web<br/>site that has space waiting.</p><p>Forest for the trees, forest for the trees....</p><p>~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~</p><p>Unrelated to the above (which is *not* a brouhaha, but a civil discussion<br/>of diverging opinions; besides, I wished Paul a speedy recovery!), I&apos;ve<br/>added links to a number of your sites from the &apos;links&apos; section on the<br/>Meadows &lt;<a href="http://www.corporeal.com/links.html">http://www.corporeal.com/links.html</a>&gt; The usual suspects would<br/>include Starrett, Monzo, Breed, Loffink, Doty, Gann, Rosati. If you happen<br/>by and think something is amiss, I&apos;m around -- write me.</p><p>Cheers,<br/>Jon</p><p>P.S. Anybody else (who gets the digest form of the list) occasionally get<br/>one that crashes your email program? Digest 204 is the second one in a few<br/>weeks that crashed Eudora when I tried to open it. I had to get the archive<br/>from the onelist website and copy it into a mail to make it safe. Ick.</p><p>P.S.S. Just came back from a concert of the Mainly Mozart Festival here in<br/>SD. Two of the pieces featured Dennis James on a for-real Glass Harmonica.<br/>Boy!
