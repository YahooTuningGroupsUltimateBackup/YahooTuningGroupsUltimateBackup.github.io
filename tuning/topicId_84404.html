Rather, you hear it as the 880 Hz &quot;2&quot; tone, even<br/>in the case where the partials are all at unity gain. I&apos;m pretty surprised<br/>by this, as you don&apos;t even hear a hint of the 440 Hz tone in the second two.<br/>This is strange enough, but the next example is even stranger: Check out the<br/>5-8-11 tone and notice that 880 Hz is still what jumps out at you.</p><p>Also check out the 4-7-10 test: I hear it as an sort of ambiguous &quot;1-2&quot;<br/>mixture that flip flops between the two of them.</p><p>Attached for each test is a set of pictures showing the first six partials<br/>of each test and two periods, with a 440 Hz impulse train overlaid, so you<br/>can confirm for yourself that the period is 1/440 second.</p><p>It might be that this phenomenon is somewhat frequency-dependent: when I<br/>tried the test again at 220 Hz, I could hear a faint 220 Hz tone on the<br/>bottom. Either way though, the 2-5-8-11 example jumped right out at me as<br/>being a &quot;2&quot;, and it wasn&apos;t unless I really listened hard that I could hear a<br/>faint &quot;1&quot; somewhere down there. This never seems to happen for tones that<br/>are 2 units apart, like 3:5:7:9:etc, where the 1 jumps out at you bright and<br/>clear. It was also much easier to hear the actual &quot;1&quot; for the examples in<br/>which the harmonics were at unity gain.</p><p>This might imply that the process by which a virtual fundamental is placed<br/>and the process by which the tones are &quot;grouped&quot; or &quot;fused&quot; together into a<br/>timbre are two separate things. It might also be related to the process by<br/>which a minor chord is heard as having a root different from the &quot;1&quot; of<br/>10:12:15. Hence, a faint virtual pitch on the bottom is produced, but you<br/>then gravitate toward hearing the much louder &quot;2&quot; as the fundamental.
