Last time I saw him, he was playing a 6-string<br/>fretless classical.  Quite a jump there, even for him.</p><p>I recall that he played microtuned Synclavier guitar on &quot;Forward March&quot;,<br/>the opening track of PMG&apos;s First Circle.  At the time, he and co-composer<br/>Lyle Mays stated they wanted the feel of a post-apocalyptic children&apos;s<br/>marching band.  I suspect he did it again, albeit with a wider palette of<br/>Synclavier sounds, on &quot;Finding And Believing&quot; from Secret Story.</p><p>I&apos;ve just acquired three of his latest CDs (Pat Metheny Trio, Pat Metheny<br/>and Jim Hall, and A Map Of the World) and I believe all of them feature<br/>fretless guitar on at least one track.</p><p>Paolo</p></div><h3><a id=9147 href="#9147">ðŸ”—</a>Paul H.
