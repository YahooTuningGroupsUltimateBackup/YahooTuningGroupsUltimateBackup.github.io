That&apos;s the reason I usually write it in Japanese, and<br/>&gt; &gt; afterwards do just translations into English and Czech</p><p>!!!</p><p>trying to keep sense and rhythm...</p><p>&gt; &gt; Real haiku has very strict rules, not only 5-7-5, but also<br/>limited themes (usually only seasons, nature beauty...), and should<br/>have some surprising last line... Pretty difficult, it&apos;s like a<br/>mathematical formula, or chess game, or Bach&apos;s harmonic counterpoint<br/>where horizontal and vertical lines are synchronized.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; So I doubt I could win one year the Emperor&apos;s competition, will<br/>be invited to the Palace and meet Him... But it&apos;s interesting that<br/>effort to fill the exact form with some content, all this on a very<br/>small space.<br/>...<br/>&gt;&gt; The older I am, the more I like this zen-like minimalistic<br/>approach, so I invented few years ago a compositional technique using<br/>only few note cells as a base of composition (what a coincidence with<br/>haiku!), and also returned to my eternal love - writing chromatic<br/>fugues which often combine 12tone atonal melodic technique with tonal<br/>harmony.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; And my New Year ringing our temple&apos;s bell is year by year better,<br/>too... There&apos;s no training possible, so I can learn only from one<br/>beat a year. Maybe after another 50 beats I can say: Hm, but this<br/>year the sound was really good... This I call pure zen. Maximal<br/>concentration in the shortest time. Best content in fixed form of<br/>some energy and vector... And feeling like whole cosmos waits that<br/>sound. Every year I&apos;m looking forward to this moment, and believe me,<br/>there&apos;s not much Japanese friends who understand fully what I&apos;m<br/>talking about.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; Daniel Forro</p><p>&gt; &gt; &gt; Lyric meter is a funny thing given a mentally fixed context<br/>where you expect such and such... and I can&apos;t begin to think how many<br/>talented lyricist sometimes fall into a hole of their own<br/>expectations in this ...</p><p>These are the things I&apos;m interested in.....these odd moments where<br/>things obviously work...<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; Take care, daniel stearns</p><p>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Ibukiyama<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; with whitecap whispers in west<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &quot;Woe, winter walks in&quot;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Daniel Forr&oacute;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;</p><p>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Silvered Alar Rise!<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; In the nameless motions of air<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; By the riven troughs of an angel&apos;s stare<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Wild things wait crouched in the valleys<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; In the shade of a birch<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; In the web of time<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Flapping like a flag<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; On a lateral line<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I saw a man<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; A lamped calligrapher<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Lit by the moon<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; The man was still<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; His eyeballs swiveled<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I nursed my nerve<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Atlantis howled<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; The Great Stars ran amok<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; A sounding loomed<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; The tide of the world broke over<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt;</p></div><h3><a id=79260 href="#79260">ðŸ”—</a>caleb morgan &#x3C;calebmrgn@...&#x3E;</h3><span>11/22/2008 4:46:26 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>I&apos;m confused if it is D Farro or Jack who wrote this, but I&apos;m quoting this little snippet for basic agreement or affinity.</p><p>I haven&apos;t written a chromatic fugue in quite some time, but, talk about eternal love...yup.</p><p>On Nov 21, 2008, at 1:36 PM, Jack wrote:</p><p>&gt; (what a coincidence with<br/>&gt; haiku!), and also returned to my eternal love - writing chromatic<br/>&gt; fugues which often combine 12tone atonal melodic technique with tonal<br/>&gt; harmony.</p></div><h3><a id=79268 href="#79268">ðŸ”—</a>Jack &#x3C;gvr.jack@...&#x3E;</h3><span>11/23/2008 8:45:05 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, caleb morgan &lt;calebmrgn@...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt; I&apos;m confused if it is D Farro or Jack who wrote this...</p><p>No, twasn&apos;t me, it was one of the Daniels. - jack</p><p>&gt;, but I&apos;m quoting this little snippet for basic agreement or<br/>&gt; affinity.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt; I haven&apos;t written a chromatic fugue in quite some time, but, talk<br/>&gt;&gt; about eternal love...yup.</p><p>&gt; On Nov 21, 2008, at 1:36 PM, Jack wrote:<br/>&gt; &gt; (what a coincidence with<br/>&gt; &gt; haiku!), and also returned to my eternal love - writing chromatic<br/>&gt; &gt; fugues which often combine 12tone atonal melodic technique with<br/>&gt; &gt; tonal harmony.</p></div>
