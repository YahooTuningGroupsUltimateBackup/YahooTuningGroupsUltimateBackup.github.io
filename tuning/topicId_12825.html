Those that find<br/>beatless or Just intervals more pleasing. I&apos;m wondering if you might<br/>know if this paper is available on the internet - or do you know how<br/>I may learn more about this? That tuning away from Just is something<br/>that is in keeping with the aesthetics of Gamelan, I do find it<br/>interesting. Certainly this is used to beautiful effect in a<br/>centuries old musical practice. But again, as before stated, IMHO -<br/>these are the raw resources of any particular tuning, rather than<br/>something that must be avoided - something to be harnessed and<br/>exploited - not rejected. It&apos;s just whatever you may be trying to<br/>achieve, in whatever context, that - to me - validates these<br/>important choices.</p><p>&gt;<br/>&gt; The traditional prohibition against parallel fifths and octaves in<br/>&gt; counterpoint is typically explained the same way -- the tones lose<br/>their<br/>&gt; independence, blending into a timbre, and the melody lines<br/>disappear.</p><p>Would it be incorrect to say that this may be more true of the lower<br/>number ratios, but when one makes choices from higher up the harmonic<br/>series - the same kinds of distictions may be obtained? Not to<br/>mention that the timbres one chooses will impact on this &quot;blending<br/>into a timbre&quot; effect (the context thing again). I personally have<br/>never seen this as a problem in my exploration of JI.</p><p>Thanks,</p><p>Jacky</p></div><h3><a id=12842 href="#12842">ðŸ”—</a>Joseph Pehrson &#x3C;josephpehrson@compuserve.com&#x3E;</h3><span>9/15/2000 7:14:44 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@egroups.com">tuning@egroups.com</a>, &quot;Paul H.
