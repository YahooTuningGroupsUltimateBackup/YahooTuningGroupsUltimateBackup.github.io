It appears that such thing has the same status melodic/motivic development has for the west.<br/> For those interested i have put up the following some time back for one composer who shared my viewpoint of cuktural exchange as a way of<br/>resisting war. It is directly modeled in spirit  after Lou Harrison moving and studiing Korean music at the end of the Korean war. we thought we<br/>would jump the gun so to speak and accept the musical thresures left for all<br/>These files start with the simpliest but we are talking long patterns so you can&apos;t be in a rush.<br/> Hopefully they might be of use to others as well as yourself , if even for inspiration<br/><a href="http://www.anaphoria.com/arab1.PDF">http://www.anaphoria.com/arab1.PDF</a><br/><a href="http://www.anaphoria.com/arab2.PDF">http://www.anaphoria.com/arab2.PDF</a></p><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;Robert Walker&quot; &lt;robertwalker@n...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt; Hi there,<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I&apos;ve been fascinated by something else a bit not so obvious to casual listening<br/>&gt; as the rhythm (which also fascinates me of course) - the number of bars you have<br/>&gt; in a repeat or other shape or structure of the music.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; It&apos;s inspired by the Van Eyck music I so enjoy practicing - he often uses phrases<br/>&gt; of 5 bars or maybe 3 and 2 bars alternating or maybe 7 bars - as natural divisions<br/>&gt; of the melody, or maybe more obviously, by using a repeat of seven bars, say.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Actually not sure if it is him doing it, or the original tunes as his pieces are<br/>&gt; divisions of popular tunes of his time.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Often the tune sounds kind of novel and fresh at first listening and unless<br/>&gt; you&apos;ve listened in a rather analytical way you don&apos;t quite know why.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; In my recent piece posted to MMM I explored that by using a pattern of bars<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; 5 5 4 5 5 4<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; and I often explore it in my music<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; See Minor and subminor at<br/>&gt; <a href="http://tunesmithy.netfirms.com/tunes/tunes.htm#minor_subminor">http://tunesmithy.netfirms.com/tunes/tunes.htm#minor_subminor</a><br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; It&apos;s amazing how these kind of long measures, kind of super bars or something,<br/>&gt; can add an extra kind of zest or surprise to the music.
