There is no difference, except that the organ tuning has to be more exact due to the sustain and expense of the organ tuning.  It is a red herring to claim otherwise.  While WIII is described first in Orgelprobe, it appears later in his Musicalishe Temperatur.  A keyboard, is a keyboard, is a keyboard.  And Baroque music involved keyboard in virtually EVERY piece written.</p><p>- It&apos;s not reputed of JSB that he retuned an entire harpsichord in<br/>Werckmeister III in 15 minutes.  It&apos;s reputed that JSB tuned entire<br/>harpsichords in 15 minutes, with nothing said one way or the other<br/>about W-III *ever* in any of his practice.</p><p>The point I raised was in response to Tom Dent&apos;s concerns about the difficulty of retuning during a concert.  My point was that it could be done under the circumstances of WIII.  And now it is clear that Bradley is able to tune a multitude of tunings on a harpsichord even quicker than Bach, or Werckmeister.</p><p>Johnny</p></div>
