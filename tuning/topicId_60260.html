The total absolute error will therefore be double the<br/>absolute error of the interval having the greatest absolute error; in<br/>a well-temperament (no 5ths or minor 3rds wider than just or major<br/>3rds narrower than just) this will be twice the absolute error of the<br/>minor 3rd.</p><p>If you didn&apos;t count the minor 3rd in your analysis, you would<br/>conclude that the best 4:5:6 in 22-equal is better than that in 19-<br/>equal, whereas a listening test demonstrates the reverse to be true.</p><p>&gt; ...<br/>&gt; Also, the total error treats the deviation in the 5th on an equal<br/>&gt; footing to the M3.

I used total absolute error because it&apos;s easier to calculate<br/>and seems to be accurate enough to quantify the general impression<br/>one has when listening to the triads.</p><p>Paul Erlich also presents a weighted approach to evaluating<br/>temperaments (to include intervals containing higher primes) in his<br/>(by-now famous, long-awaited, and soon-to-be-published, we<br/>hope) &quot;middle-path&quot; paper -- I don&apos;t recall exactly how these are<br/>weighted, but I hope Paul will chime in.  (I see he already has.)</p><p>BTW, I&apos;ve found 2/5-comma 5ths and major 3rds somewhat wider than<br/>Pythagorean to be not only tolerable, but downright *exciting* under<br/>certain circumstances (e.g., in passing, in other than the tonic<br/>triad; but that&apos;s a matter of opinion, and a separate issue that<br/>really doesn&apos;t contradict your point).  Under these circumstances a<br/>major 3rd as wide as 11:14 might be tolerable, or if (like Margo<br/>Schulter) you&apos;re into medieval music (where 3rds and 6ths are not<br/>regarded as being truly consonant) you might just find it your cup of<br/>tea -- preferable to Pythagorean.  (But I digress.)</p><p>&gt; One measure that does this is the deviation from the meantone<br/>relation<br/>&gt; T = (Pythagorean M3) - 4(pure 5th-F).<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; That is, I propose a score equal to<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; T - (Pythagorean M3) + 4(pure 5th-F)<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; which can also be written as<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; (sharpness of M3) - SC + 4(flatness of 5th).<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Any regular tuning has score 0.</p><p>I don&apos;t understand this.  What do you mean by &quot;regular tuning&quot;?  I<br/>understand this (in the present context) to mean a tuning in which<br/>all of the fifths in a chain are the same size.  So Pythagorean, 12-<br/>ET, and 1/n-comma meantone would all be regular tunings -- but a<br/>triad from each one of these would have the same score?</p><p>&gt; Positive score means that the third is<br/>&gt; &apos;worse than expected&apos; from a regular tuning based on the fifth,<br/>&gt; negative score means the third is &apos;better than expected&apos;. In my<br/>&gt; experience positive score means the triad sounds &apos;tenser&apos; and<br/>negative<br/>&gt; means more &apos;relaxed&apos;. Typically sharp keys have positive score and<br/>&gt; flat keys have negative.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; For example D major in Werckmeister III has M3 sharp by 1/2 comma<br/>and<br/>&gt;  5 flat by 1/4 comma (fudging it to the syntonic comma). Then the<br/>score is<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; SC/2 - SC + 4*(SC/4) or +SC/2<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; so Dmaj is noticeably more tense than in any meantone. +SC/2 is<br/>about<br/>&gt; my limit of toleration.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Of course this &apos;score&apos; is not the whole story, and I also impose<br/>&gt; limits that the M3 should be below Pythagorean, and the 5th should<br/>not<br/>&gt; be flatter than 1/4 comma.</p><p>I gather that you&apos;re making this statement in reference to a low-<br/>contrast well-temperament, in which any key may (arguably) serve as a<br/>tonic, as opposed to something more divergent from 12-ET, such as a<br/>_temperament ordinaire_, in which all triads are usable, but some are<br/>(arguably) not too suitable as tonics.  I say &quot;arguably&quot; because the<br/>issue of how much temperament in a major third (or major triad) is<br/>acceptable (as well as how much temperament is acceptable in the best<br/>keys) is largely subjective and fluid.  Two cases in point from my<br/>own experience:</p><p>1) When I first tried 1/4-comma meantone temperament (over 40 years<br/>ago) I put it on an electronic organ and played it that way for<br/>several weeks.  Upon putting the instrument back into 12-ET, I was<br/>absolutely shocked by how dissonant and out-of-tune it sounded.  It<br/>took me a few days to recover to the point where it began to sound<br/>even marginally acceptable, and after a short time, I set about<br/>seeking an alternative (unequal) tuning that would give me some<br/>respite from the constant restless mood I experienced thereafter.  In<br/>such a circumstance, you would not have been able to sell me on a<br/>well-temperament with 5/23-comma in the narrowest 5ths; I tried<br/>Valotti-Young and found it wanting, because it didn&apos;t deliver the<br/>consonance of the (1/4-comma) meantone triads that I desired.  I<br/>eventually ended up designing my own temperament.</p><p>2) I tuned my own (acoustic) piano to my own #2 well-temperament, in<br/>which the 5 worst major triads have total absolute error equal to<br/>that of Pythagorean triads.  At first I avoided playing anything in<br/>any of those keys, but after a matter of weeks I became accustomed to<br/>their sound, eventually valuing them for the &quot;exciting&quot; mood they<br/>conveyed, in contrast to the calmer meantone-like sound of the most<br/>consonant triads.  I kept the piano tuned this way for over 5 years<br/>(until I moved cross-country and sold the instrument).</p><p>I don&apos;t think one can safely assume that a low-contrast well-<br/>temperament (in which the error of the worst triads is minimized)<br/>will be acceptable to everyone, nor that a well-designed higher-<br/>contrast _temperament ordinaire_ will not be acceptable to anyone in<br/>the remote keys.  It&apos;s largely a matter of conditioning.</p><p>&gt; Incidentally George was wondering why I would want to improve (the<br/>&gt; third of) F#maj at the expense of Dmaj, or Abmaj at the expense of<br/>&gt; Emaj. The answer is that I want a real circulating temperament in<br/>&gt; which *every* key sounds pretty good even on the overtone-rich<br/>&gt; harpsichord.</p><p>That depends on what one means by &quot;pretty&quot; and &quot;good&quot;, again, a<br/>matter of opinion (see above :-).  For me high contrast between the<br/>best keys and 12-ET is &quot;pretty&quot; and &quot;good&quot;, but for you that would be<br/>low contrast between the worst keys and 12-ET.</p><p>I wasn&apos;t wondering *why* you would want to improve F# major at the<br/>expense of D major.  I was only giving reasons for *not doing so* in<br/>my #1 temperament, to which I would add another: The F# and C# major<br/>triads presently have an equal amount of total absolute error and B<br/>and G#/Ab virtually the same amount; reducing the error of F# would<br/>impair the balance in the progression of error around the circle of<br/>5ths.</p><p>&gt; I&apos;ve had a lot of practice in designing these, but not<br/>&gt; tried to introduce proportional beating until now.</p><p>Same here.  I&apos;d say that it adds a completely different dimension to<br/>the task!</p><p>--George</p></div><h3>wallyesterpaulrus &#x3C;wallyesterpaulrus@yahoo.com&#x3E;</h3><span>9/8/2005 3:20:26 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;George D.

Using this<br/>method, most historical circular temps favour the sharps and flats<br/>equally (Vallotti, Young I) or even favour the sharps (Young I,<br/>ordinaire). This is what people then thought preferable or ideally<br/>balanced, based on their methods of evaluation.</p><p>The only way to judge a temperament is aesthetically, which requires<br/>input of individual taste. Any formulae for &apos;scoring&apos; temps are only<br/>ways of formalizing personal preferences. Although there are objective<br/>*descriptions* of temperaments, there are no objective evaluations<br/>which tell us beyond dispute that one is better than another.</p><p>I said immediately that my proposal has an element of personal taste.<br/>So does George&apos;s total error, or any other formula.

My principal reference is Page 2 of<br/>&gt; Werckmeister 1691 where he says that the perfect consonances can<br/>bear<br/>&gt; much less tempering than the imperfect ones - and even that the M3<br/>can<br/>&gt; bear less tempering than the m3 and M6.</p><p>Historically, advocates of 12-note circulating temperaments generally<br/>seem to make claims like this, but to my mind this is little more<br/>than self-justification or even advertising. You&apos;ll find a whole<br/>range of remarks on this subject, differing radically from writer to<br/>writer and according to time period. Jorgenson is a good reference<br/>for this sort of thing. Robert Smith, for example, says something<br/>quite the opposite to this. I&apos;m just trying to bring the issue up to<br/>date in the context of a more general microtonal endeavor. I probably<br/>overstepped the bounds of this discussion in doing so. I apologize.<br/>Though if I got anyone to listen to sounds or music they otherwise<br/>wouldn&apos;t have listened to, I have to say it was worth it.</p><p>But Tom, a more general formula for scoring triads can always be put<br/>to use in the context with constraints on the tunings such as those<br/>that meantone or closed 12-note systems, or or any of the other &apos;non-<br/>traditional&apos; systems, impose. So there&apos;s no need, in my mind, to<br/>develop &apos;specialized&apos; formulas that only work in limited contexts.<br/>George Secor proposed a formula that could work in any context, and<br/>it&apos;s not all that difficult to compute.

Right?<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; Not necessarily! (...)<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; Of course if the m3 becomes sharp, all bets are off...<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Well that&apos;s what I meant by &apos;fail&apos; above. What did you mean by &apos;not<br/>&gt; necessarily&apos;?</p><p>I meant the *fifth* can be sharp and the score will still make some<br/>sense (to me at least). If the m3 is sharp or the M3 flat, yes, I<br/>wouldn&apos;t know what to make of it. But you can still calculate it and<br/>see if it sense to you. Maybe it does, just that I have little<br/>experience in these types of tuning.</p><p>&gt; &gt; The score then decreases, reflecting my judgement that a slightly<br/>&gt; &gt; sharp fifth can make a triad sound *less* tense if the third is<br/>&gt; &gt; quite sharp.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Good. So your score has some of the properties a general score should<br/>&gt; have, but falls apart in certain (non-typical for Western tunings)<br/>&gt; situations. Is this a fair statement?</p><p>Probably. I invented it as an aid to constructing 12-note circ. temps.<br/>Although, you *can* always calculate it for a 4-5-6 chord just as</p><p>(T - pure M3) + 4(pure 5th - F) - SC</p><p>and it *will* always tell you how much the third is sharp relative to<br/>a regular tuning based on the given fifth. Whether this is directly<br/>useful depends on whether you are dealing with tunings where the 3rd<br/>is produced by a chain of 3 or 4 comparable fifths and where there is<br/>key-colour.</p><p>&gt; &gt; I suspect this may correspond with the use of some temperament<br/>&gt; &gt; ordinaires in flat keys.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I don&apos;t get it, but I&apos;ll keep my eyes peeled for an explanation.</p><p>Meaning... some flat keys in temperaments ordinaires have pretty large<br/>major thirds, which ought to sound bad but aren&apos;t so terrible when<br/>combined with the sharper fifths.</p><p>&gt; (...) having the temperament constraints mixed up in<br/>&gt; the scoring to begin with.</p><p>As I said, the score can be *calculated* for any triad (one can<br/>generalise it to ~12:15:18 too), but its musical usefulness varies in<br/>context. I don&apos;t impose any constraints on the calculation itself.</p><p>&gt; The triad has two dimensions (...) So we *need* more than one measure.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; If you&apos;re trying to find some sort of &apos;optimum&apos;, it seems that<br/>&gt; ultimately you have to reduce it down to one measure,<br/>&gt; otherwise &apos;optimum&apos; can&apos;t even be defined.</p><p>Ah, but who said that circular (or any irregular) temps. were about<br/>finding a single optimum triad? Unless the optimum is 12tet, you can&apos;t<br/>create a 12-note circ. temp and stay at or even very near an optimum.<br/>Irregular temps are precisely about exploiting various different<br/>triads which however all sound reasonably good.</p><p>&gt; So what are you going to do with your more than one measure once you<br/>&gt; have them?</p><p>Make circ. temps! The main characteristic feature I see of many circ.<br/>temps is that they consist of chunks of *different* regular tunings<br/>split up and stuck together. For example Young I is one chunk each of<br/>1/6 PC and Pythag. plus two little chunks of 12tet. The obvious effect<br/>this has is making the variations of sizes of thirds. So that is my<br/>first score. The M3 and m3 start near pure around C maj and get<br/>progressively worse on either side.</p><p>This makes sense to me since often in 18th-19th century music one has<br/>just thirds/6ths without the fifth. So first we require that all<br/>thirds sound OK. But that only gets you so far: it doesn&apos;t see the<br/>fifth, and it doesn&apos;t allow you to tell the difference between<br/>intonation on the &apos;sharp&apos; side where the fifths are getting sharper<br/>going round the circle (clockwise) and the &apos;flat&apos; side where they are<br/>getting flatter.</p><p>So I have another score that tells me how adding the fifth affects the<br/>sound. Also, it can differentiate between intonation on the sharp side<br/>and the flat side.</p><p>Now, we come to the central point. Circ temps to me are about creating<br/>the widest *variety* of tunings between different keys, but without<br/>any of them being obtrusively out of tune - &apos;obtrusive&apos; depending on<br/>taste... This means that you take the third-quality from as near pure<br/>as possible (given constraints) to as far from pure as you can take.<br/>*Then* you also try to maximise the distinction between sharp and flat<br/>keys with similar third-sizes. This you can measure with the new<br/>score. However, one should also impose a *limit* on the new score<br/>since triads with a too sharp third and flat fifth are likely to sound<br/>harsh. Within the limits again you go from the minimum to the maximum.</p><p>So, you create a trajectory within your preferred allowed region to<br/>enclose the maximum area in the 2d graph and you have a circ. temp<br/>with good-enough intonation all round the circle and the maximum<br/>amount of difference between keys.</p><p>&gt; &gt; George&apos;s measures &apos;purity vs. impurity of the worst interval&apos;:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Worst interval? I thought it was the sum of all three(?)</p><p>I still think that when you add up all three you get twice the worst one.</p><p>&gt; &gt; I might prefer<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; 0 406 702<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; to<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; 0 402 698.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Well, me too. How about total absolute error of the three intervals<br/>&gt; where the weight on the fifth is 1.465 times greater than the weight<br/>&gt; on each of the two thirds? Or what if you *square* the three errors<br/>&gt; (weighted or unweighted) before adding them?</p><p>All interesting - particularly the business of squaring errors, which<br/>would tend to pull away from say 1/6 comma and towards tunings with<br/>either pure 5ths or nearly-pure 3rds.

If<br/>there&apos;s a big difference in the total absolute error of two triads,<br/>then I think you can safely say that one will sound more consonant<br/>than the other, but where the numbers are close, then it&apos;s advisable<br/>to do a listening test.</p><p>--George</p></div><h3>wallyesterpaulrus &#x3C;wallyesterpaulrus@yahoo.com&#x3E;</h3><span>9/13/2005 11:58:51 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Hi Tom, talking to you is a pleasure!</p><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;Tom Dent&quot; &lt;stringph@g...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt; --- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;wallyesterpaulrus&quot;<br/>&gt; &lt;wallyesterpaulrus@y...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt; &gt; --- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;Tom Dent&quot; &lt;stringph@g...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; All interesting - particularly the business of squaring errors,<br/>which<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; would tend to pull away from say 1/6 comma and towards tunings<br/>with<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; either pure 5ths or nearly-pure 3rds.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; I don&apos;t know what you mean by that -- here&apos;s a graph you might be<br/>&gt; &gt; interested in:<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; <a href="http://launch.groups.yahoo.com/group/tuning/files/perlich/pop.gif">http://launch.groups.yahoo.com/group/tuning/files/perlich/pop.gif</a><br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; Squaring corresponds to p=2 on the horizontal axis, and there&apos;s a<br/>&gt; &gt; purple line on the graph above the numeral &apos;2&apos; which represents<br/>it.

Margo Schulter agrees:</p><p>&gt; Or should one weight different keys in the temp by different amounts<br/>&gt; reflecting frequency of use (eg Barnes numbers)?? ... which would<br/>&gt; automatically introduce inequality.</p><p>Right -- that makes sense to me. Getting back to the original point,<br/>though, George&apos;s method of rating (using a rating system that can<br/>apply to *any* tuning system) each of the triads in a well-<br/>temperament is a great way of seeing, at a glance, whether all &quot;keys&quot;<br/>are going to be usable, or if some of them would have a tonic triad<br/>too unstable for more than passing use.</p><p>Best,<br/>Paul</p></div><h3>wallyesterpaulrus &#x3C;wallyesterpaulrus@yahoo.com&#x3E;</h3><span>9/13/2005 12:02:49 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;George D.
