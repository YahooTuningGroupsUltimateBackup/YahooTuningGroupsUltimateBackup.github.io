W. based everything on Praetorean tuning (1/4 comma<br/>meantone).  Werckmeister chromatic allows for 12 different major and minor<br/>keys that mirror to some extent the entire treasure trove of Western tunings.<br/> While 1/6th commas is mirrored most closely in G or D major, I think it is<br/>only against the model of just intonation that one can measure temperaments.<br/>W. chromatic includes Pythagorean tuning and equal temperament as well (in<br/>particular keys).</p><p>To JdL: The beauty of Werckmeister III (chromatic) is that any key can be<br/>beautiful, and distinctively so.  It was clearly not important for Bach to<br/>emphasize these distinctions in a garish manner.  All his modulations are<br/>related, while the chromatic action takes place within the key.</p><p>Johnny Reinhard</p></div>
