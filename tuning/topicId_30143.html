(Although I notice Graham has slipped back into using ^ and v, instead of the 72-tET-consistent &gt; and &lt;), as the accidentals for the decimal notation). I think it is time for us to go further and agree on a standard key for Blackjack within the larger 72-tET.</p><p>David Clark of MIT has a theory of standards that he calls &quot;The apocalypse of the two elephants&quot;. It is illustrated by a graph of activity plotted against time. The curve has two humps (the two elephants).</p><p>When a subject is first discovered, there is an explosion of research activity consisting of papers, meetings and discussions. This eventually dies down. Some time later other people (or corporations) become convinced of its value, which leads to an explosion of investment activity.</p><p>It is essential that standards be created in the trough between the two &quot;elephants&quot;. If they are written too early, before the research is finished, the subject may still be poorly understood, which leads to bad standards [of which, I must now admit, my original D-centered Blackjack proposal, is one].</p><p>If they are written too late, so many people may have already made major investments (of time and/or money) in so many different ways of doing the thing, that any standard will simply be ignored, no matter what benefits it might clearly offer.</p><p>If the interval between the two elephants is very short (because everyone is in too much of a hurry to get started) the standards will get crushed.</p><p>Notational standards are good because they facilitate communication and sharing of new discoveries.</p><p>We already have the problem of Joseph unable to make sense of Graham&apos;s chords. And we have Alison about to invest in instrument construction using a Blackjack key which is different to Joseph&apos;s and Graham&apos;s and mine [I know that&apos;s partly my fault]. We&apos;ve got at least four different ways of doing it already.</p><p>Four different &quot;languages&quot; requires 6 different translations.</p><p>A &lt;-&gt; B<br/>A &lt;-&gt; C<br/>A &lt;-&gt; D<br/>B &lt;-&gt; C<br/>B &lt;-&gt; D<br/>C &lt;-&gt; D</p><p>And trying to remember which &quot;language&quot; a particular person uses, is just a headache.</p><p>Even if a person chooses to continue using their own key privately (because they can&apos;t bear to give up their existing investment) they should at least be willing to use a standard key for communicating with others, assuming they agree that the standard has obvious benefits for newcomers.</p><p>Before we start proposing standards we should first discuss how we would know a good standard if we found it. What are the properties that we want of the standard Blackjack key when expressed in (ASCIIfied) Sims notation (I propose we leave decimal notation out of it for now).</p><p>The primary concern is that it should minimise the number of accidentals in actual music. But how can we predict what will be needed in actual music? My early D-centered proposal assumed all notes were equally likely and gave minimum accidentals with equal numbers of sharps and flats, in emulation of meantone notation. This was wrong.</p><p>Joseph&apos;s C-centered proposal seems to assume that the central note of the chain of secors, the one with the small scale steps on both sides of it, is in some sense a &quot;tonic note&quot; for Blackjack. This is wrong. It is certainly a note that is melodically distinguished when the complete Blackjack scale is played, but in actual music, using relatively consonant chords and subset scales capable of forming a melodic gestalt, this note may in fact be the _least_ used! But I agree that our standard Blackjack key _should_ contain a C natural (somewhere) if possible.</p><p>If Alison&apos;s major requirements are (correct me if I&apos;m wrong) that it have an A natural in it (for tuning reference), and that it contain a major diatonic with no second that is notated with the maximum number of natural notes, then there are several to choose from, one of which should satisfy everyone else too. I suppose also, that Alison wants those instruments built with only subsets of Blackjack to have maximum naturals too. Don&apos;t start building those instruments just yet Alison. :-)</p><p>So I think we have enough knowledge about the available chords and subset scales now to be able to see how often a given Blackjack key is likely to allow us to use naturals.</p><p>The first thing to note is that the naturals must form a single chain of fifths in blackjack. The longest such chain available in blackjack has 4 notes in it. It can occur in 1 of 3 positions. Most relatively consonant chords and most subset scales, will contain fifths. We would prefer to have the _roots_ of chords in particular, being naturals as often as possible. The root will usually be the &quot;lowest&quot; note in any chain of fifths the chord contains.</p><p>It also wouldn&apos;t hurt if the note most likely to be the root of a consonant chord or the tonic of a subset scale, was a C, or after Partch a G, but this is not essential.</p><p>    Chain of 21 secors<br/>    +--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+<br/>    Maximal chains of four fifths<br/>    +-----------------+-----------------+-----------------+<br/>       +-----------------+-----------------+-----------------+<br/>          +-----------------+-----------------+-----------------+<br/>    JI Major scales with no second<br/>    +-----------------+--+--------------+--T-----------------+<br/>       +-----------------+--+--------------+--T-----------------+<br/>    JI Minor scales with no fourth<br/>    T-----------------+--+--------------+--+-----------------+<br/>       T-----------------+--+--------------+--+-----------------+<br/>    Maximally consonant chords<br/>    5--------------7-----1----otonal-------3-----------------9<br/>       5--------------7-----1----otonal-------3-----------------9<br/>   1/9---------------1/3------utonal---1/1---1/7------------1/5<br/>      1/9---------------1/3------utonal---1/1---1/7------------1/5</p><p>I think there&apos;s enough information there for anyone to figure out which chain of four fifths should have the naturals, and what those naturals should be. One of us has apparently already figured this out and is already using the resulting key.</p><p>By the way Joseph, heres a translation from Graham&apos;s to yours. But I think Graham made some typos in some of those chords because the decimal notation doesn&apos;t always agree with the Sims notation.</p><p>Here they are as chains of secors.</p><p>Graham Breed&apos;s Blackjack key<br/>    Bv C Db^ D&gt; E[ F&lt;F#v G Ab^ A&gt; B[ C&lt;C#v D Eb^ E&gt; F] G&lt;G#v A Bb^<br/>    C&gt; D[Eb&lt; Ev F Gb^ G&gt; A[Bb&lt; Bv C Db^ D&gt; E[ F&lt;F#v G Ab^ A&gt; B[ C&lt;<br/>Joseph Pehrson&apos;s Blackjack key</p><p>And now in pitch order.</p><p>Graham<br/>    Joseph<br/>G   A[<br/>G#v A&gt;<br/>Ab^ Bb&lt;<br/>A   B[<br/>A&gt;  Bv<br/>Bb^ C&lt;<br/>B[  C<br/>Bv  C&gt;<br/>C&lt;  Db^<br/>C   D[<br/>C#v D&gt;<br/>Db^ Eb&lt;<br/>D   E[<br/>D&gt;  E<br/>Eb^ F&lt;<br/>E[  F<br/>E&gt;  F#v<br/>F&lt;  Gb^<br/>F]  G<br/>F#v G&gt;<br/>G&lt;  Ab^</p><p>Notice something about Graham&apos;s key?

However, as you<br/>know, and as Margo Schulter has mentioned on this list, the<br/>gravitational pull of &quot;C&quot;  [even moreso, &quot;big daddy&quot; MIDDLE C] has a<br/>profound influence on our Western musical culture.</p><p>I particularly like the fact that the &quot;middle C&quot; on my keyboard<br/>matches that of my traditional piano in 12-tET.</p><p>However, if &quot;D&quot; would have to be my standard, I guess I could live<br/>with it, but I think the reasons would have to be pretty<br/>significant...</p><p>&gt; We already have the problem of Joseph unable to make sense of<br/>Graham&apos;s chords.

I think one of<br/>the great &quot;virtues&quot; of Blackjack is that it&apos;s a subset of 72-tET, and<br/>one of the great virtues of 72-tET is that it *contains* 12-tET in<br/>all it&apos;s glory...  So, I would prefer leaving the &quot;original&quot; sharps<br/>and flats of 12 and 72-tET intact and just &quot;add on&quot; from there.  In<br/>that sense, I find the &quot;double accidentals&quot; actually *simpler!*</p><p>This isn&apos;t the _only_ Blackjack key that has this property.

I&apos;ll do that</p><p>2) A converted visual Blackjack lattice of Paul&apos;s design, that I use<br/>all the time.</p><p>3) The 10 pages or so of Blackjack chords that Paul made all<br/>converted (parallel chords) since I use those all the time, too.</p><p>4) The conversion of about 20 to 30 Tuning List posts related to<br/>my &quot;former&quot; key in Blackjack that I frequently use...</p><p>Whew!...  This had better be worth it, Dave.</p><p>So far, Paul Erlich has &quot;weighed in&quot; on the fact that the conversion<br/>isn&apos;t really worth the effort, at least that&apos;s been my impression.<br/>(I could be mistaken).</p><p>So, Paul would have to thrash it out and be convinced first, and then<br/>help me reconstruct all these composing tools.</p><p>Then, I guess we would have the &quot;gold standard...&quot;  but nobody seems<br/>convinced so far... ??  :)</p><p>Thanks!!!</p><p>Joseph</p></div><h3><a id=30164 href="#30164">ðŸ”—</a>Alison Monteith &#x3C;alison.monteith3@which.net&#x3E;</h3><span>11/14/2001 10:41:34 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>David C Keenan wrote:</p><p>&gt; It is essential that standards be created in the trough between the two &quot;elephants&quot;.

What are the properties that we want of the standard Blackjack key when expressed in (ASCIIfied) Sims notation (I propose we leave decimal notation out of it for now).</p><p>1. Ease of use for the composer - that means for those of us like Joseph who exploits his familiarity with a standard keyboard and likes his middle C and those of us like myself who want an A natural at A440 in order to have a clear point of connection at afuture date with &apos;conventional&apos; string, wind and brass players. I would tend to agree with Joseph that from the working composer&apos;s point of view it does matter that we have a &apos;tonic&apos; with the small step on either side. He&apos;s chosen C. I chose A, then changed to F] .</p><p>Having said that, I&apos;m not too clear in my own mind as to the relevance of &apos;key&apos; and &apos;tonic&apos; in most of my own music. I don&apos;t follow common practice tonal musical structures and therefore fast and elaborate modulations are not part of my language. There might be composers out there who like to know what &apos;key&apos; they are in and they might have different notational needs from me.</p><p>2. Ease of use by the player. I know that I&apos;m going to have to do a lot of persuasive dancing around with performers. A clear, logical and consistent notation will help to bridge the &apos;fear of the new&apos; gap that we all have to cross in new music ventures. An orchestral percussionist faced with 36 steel tubes tuned to a subset of 72et should have as many familiar points of reference as possible.</p><p>&gt; The primary concern is that it should minimise the number of accidentals in actual music. But how can we predict what will be needed in actual music? My early D-centered proposal assumed all notes were equally likely and gave minimum accidentals with equal numbers of sharps and flats, in emulation of meantone notation.

This is wrong.

I suppose also, that Alison wants those instruments built with only subsets of Blackjack to have maximum naturals too. Don&apos;t start building those instruments just yet Alison. :-)</p><p>I don&apos;t need the major diatonic with no second. That was a misunderstanding. I do want the A natural though. The strings are strung and tuned to their various subsets. They can be retuned because a shift to a new standard shouldn&apos;t involve any drastic changes. As for the fixed pitch department I&apos;ve cut and tuned a few tubes but I&apos;ve enough steel for a full set so I can hold on for some discussion on a new standard.</p><p>&gt;<br/>&gt; By the way Alison, here&apos;s Graham&apos;s key in Hertz.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Name   Frequency<br/>&gt;        (hertz)<br/>&gt; ----------------<br/>&gt; G       195.998<br/>&gt; G#v     205.663<br/>&gt; Ab^     209.661<br/>&gt; A       220.000<br/>&gt; A&gt;      224.277<br/>&gt; Bb^     235.337<br/>&gt; B[      239.912<br/>&gt; Bv      244.576<br/>&gt; C&lt;      256.636<br/>&gt; C       261.626<br/>&gt; C#v     274.527<br/>&gt; Db^     279.864<br/>&gt; D       293.665<br/>&gt; D&gt;      299.374<br/>&gt; Eb^     314.137<br/>&gt; E[      320.244<br/>&gt; E&gt;      336.036<br/>&gt; F&lt;      342.568<br/>&gt; F]      359.461<br/>&gt; F#v     366.450<br/>&gt; G&lt;      384.520<br/>&gt; (G)     391.995<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Regards,<br/>&gt; -- Dave Keenan<br/>&gt; Brisbane, Australia<br/>&gt; <a href="http://dkeenan.com">http://dkeenan.com</a></p><p>Thanks Dave for starting this one off.
