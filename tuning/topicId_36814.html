That phrase applies to my group as a whole, but not<br/>to all individuals. Some are well above &quot;average&quot; and some<br/>significantly below. I will use myself and others I have worked with<br/>to project for &quot;very good choral artists&quot;.</p><p>&quot;...how hard would you say it would be to reproduce this with average<br/>singers?&quot;</p><p>Well, first they would have to have been trained for some time in<br/>recognizing just intervals reliably. I have a specific warmup routine<br/>that is mathematically designed to culitivate this ability in any<br/>singer with even a modestly musical ear. It starts from simple<br/>intervals, fifths, fourths, thirds, against an electronic keyboard<br/>drone with the difference tones reinforced in the bass with unisons<br/>to them. I use a standard 12-EDO keyobard and employing octaves,<br/>fifths and fourths exclusively, since they are the only &quot;quasi-JI&quot;<br/>intervals.</p><p>The vowel should be &quot;ooh&quot; as in the Latin or Italian &quot;u&quot;. This is<br/>important for maximizing the feedback from difference tones. I<br/>encourage active but relaxed listening for the difference tones, that<br/>is, with no anxiety if they don&apos;t hear them. They still respond to<br/>them intuitively even if they don&apos;t. Some will hear them explicitly<br/>and some never do.</p><p>The exercises go from simple to more complex till they are pretty<br/>much like &quot;real&quot; music. The simplest exercises at the start are<br/>specifically designed to maximize the acoustic handles singers<br/>intuitively use to adjust intonation for purity of vertical harmony.</p><p>This provides maximum clarity of experience. Once singers have<br/>experienced what purity feels/sounds like, the context can be<br/>gradually made more complex (less clearly isolated) and they will<br/>continue to recognize it well enough to respond accurately to it<br/>intuitively.</p><p>After some time of practicing these warmups, any reasonably viable<br/>amateur choir will begin to spontaneously adjust for pure intonation<br/>in singing actual compositions as long as a chord lasts for a little<br/>while. Part of what I do to reinforce this for faster passages is to<br/>slow down challenging passages for intonation and have them sing<br/>on &quot;looh&quot; or &quot;dooh&quot;, depending on the articulation desired.</p><p>It is important also to use variations on the exercises or accelerate<br/>them in a way that eliminates the possibility of remaining in &quot;search<br/>mode&quot;. The longer chords tune themselves, as mentioned above, because<br/>the singers are trained to adjust for pure harmonies. At accelerated<br/>tempos or shorter note values, there is no time for this.</p><p>So a crucial part of training for adaptive JI is to allow search mode<br/>to take place, then repeat the same thing at a faster tempo so they<br/>are required to find the same pitches through melodic memory of what<br/>the search mode yielded for them. This way you are training them to<br/>convert the products of search mode tuning to a more developed sense<br/>of interval prediction without &quot;reinventing the wheel&quot; each time.</p><p>&quot;...with very good choral artists?&quot;</p><p>I would use the same procedures, but extrapolating from experience<br/>with the more musical members of my choirs the process is greatly<br/>accelerated with any significant talent. An extremely important<br/>factor that you cannot ignore, however, is the value they place on<br/>taking the trouble. You have to have some means available to let them<br/>hear what an enormously beautiful difference it makes. You can&apos;t<br/>assume they will &quot;get it&quot; just from doing it while buried in the<br/>middle of a choir. Some do and others don&apos;t. There are huge<br/>individual variations in this.</p><p>Some people just can&apos;t seem to sing and hear what&apos;s going around them<br/>well at the same time. You have to get them out of the choir. Two<br/>important ways of handling this is to use modern recording technology<br/>and/or to rotate people onto the &quot;bench&quot; to listen. I do both, but<br/>mostly the rotation. Recording and playing back is very time<br/>consuming. I never cease to be amazed, though, at how some people<br/>remain total clueless as to how good we sound till they hear us on he<br/>way back from the bathroom or something.</p><p>&quot;And would you need to rehearse slowly, to hear the harmonic<br/>movements in their purity, or do people start to click with the<br/>intervals and then proceed naturally?&quot;</p><p>Yes, and yes... As I&apos;ve already implied, it is important to stop and<br/>deal with some passages very slowly on &quot;looh&quot; or &quot;dooh&quot;. It is also<br/>very effective and even essential to do this SOFTLY (he shouts<br/>ironically). Over time they will begin to &quot;click with the intervals<br/>and then proceed naturally&quot;.</p><p>Jon:<br/>&gt; I wish I had better ways of describing what listening to music like<br/>&gt; this is for me; I know in my heart that numbers would describe it<br/>&gt; best, but all I know is that some of the resolutions simply do<br/>funny<br/>&gt; things to my head, like breathing in a straight shot of pure<br/>oxygen,<br/>&gt; or opening a door from a heated room and getting a bracing, cold<br/>&gt; blast of outside air.</p><p>Bob:<br/>Ha-ha! Well, this sequence deliberately avoids any basis in<br/>traditional functional harmonic principles. It is a variation of a<br/>row I came up with ages ago in composition class (circa 1966). It was<br/>an experiment in integrating the pantonal concepts of Schoenberg with<br/>the &quot;free tonal counterpoint&quot; I was studying based on Hindemith&apos;s<br/>ideas.</p><p>Hindemith liked the idea of a tonal center, as do I. I think it is<br/>fundamental to psychoacoustically friendly music for human beings.<br/>Hindemith also revered the properties of Gregorian chant as &quot;ideal<br/>melody&quot;. I concur that singing and singability (no prejudice here, of<br/>course, being the singer that I am) is fundamental to the appeal of<br/>music to the extent of not being completely disposable even if not<br/>omnipresent where pitch-based music is concerned. (I like the melodic<br/>tuning of percussion and the melodic nature of percussion performance<br/>as evidenced in Max Roach&apos;s album &quot;A Drum Also Waltzes&quot; and much<br/>African percussion.</p><p>So the row I wrote this variation of is:</p><p>Ab F G (up a fifth)D A B(natural) G#</p><p>In 12-EDO the tonal center is Ab/G#, which of course are equivalent<br/>in that tuning. This row has the interesting properties of adhering<br/>strictly to Hindemith&apos;s rules for free-tonal counterpoint and going<br/>from one side of the circle fifths to the opposite side in the least<br/>number of notes while doing so. It&apos;s retrograde and inversion are the<br/>same except for the octave displacement of the D. Its retrograde<br/>inversion is the same sequence as itself.</p><p>It also contains implicit within it the potential for very<br/>fascinating contrapuntal/harmonic exploitation that relates quartal<br/>harmonies (harmony built in fourths) and the 12-EDO chromatic scale<br/>at different rhythmic strata. I actually demonstrated this<br/>practically once with an Alleluia I wrote for SATB choir.</p><p>I taught it to the humble little amateur church choir I was directing<br/>at the time. They loved it and they sang it beautifully,<br/>demonstrating that pantonal music (no meaningful key signature<br/>possible) with a clear tonal center can be quite singable. What was<br/>more interesting was that the very musically unsophisticated<br/>congregation loved it, too.</p><p>Now I have come full circle and with a slight twist of the<br/>wrist &quot;adapted&quot; it ironically to &quot;non-adaptive&quot; JI, where it also<br/>comes out to a G# &quot;equivalent&quot; to Ab (+2 cents), although by a subtly<br/>different but vastly purer harmonic path.</p><p>&gt;<br/>&gt; Gad, words are useless sometimes, but the best I have at the moment.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Cheers,<br/>&gt; Jon<br/>&gt;<br/>&Oslash;&#x9;P.S.

And then sing in context, as well as in the ultimate performance tempo.</p><p>&gt; Some do and others don&apos;t. There are huge individual variations in<br/>&gt; this.</p><p>Humanity.</p><p>&gt; Hindemith liked the idea of a tonal center, as do I.</p><p>And drones exist throughout the world, etc. I think many, if not most of the significant musics, operate with some sense of &apos;gravity&apos; where you are pulled to a core value (be it a drone, or tonal center, or tonic chord, or whatever).

My most memorable<br/>moments, beyond learning/feeling the warmth and value of singing in-<br/>tune intervals and the wonderful melodies/harmonies that lay outside<br/>of the 12tet prison cell, is the process of focussing in on the small<br/>intervals, until they became as large and identifiable (internally)<br/>as any other interval I had previously encountered. IOW, it *is*<br/>learnable, and it is possible to internalize these things!)<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; --- In tuning@y..., &quot;robert_wendell&quot; &lt;rwendell@c...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt; &gt; That phrase applies to my group as a whole, but not<br/>&gt; &gt; to all individuals.

Once singers have<br/>&gt; &gt; experienced what purity feels/sounds like, the context can be<br/>&gt; &gt; gradually made more complex (less clearly isolated) and they will<br/>&gt; &gt; continue to recognize it well enough to respond accurately to it<br/>&gt; &gt; intuitively.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Great job of thinking out this process. Probably good for *all*<br/>musicians to do things like this!<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; It is important also to use variations on the exercises or<br/>&gt; &gt; accelerate them in a way that eliminates the possibility of<br/>&gt; &gt; remaining in &quot;search mode&quot;.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Fascinating.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; So a crucial part of training for adaptive JI is to allow search<br/>&gt; &gt; mode to take place, then repeat the same thing at a faster tempo<br/>&gt; &gt; so they are required to find the same pitches through melodic<br/>&gt; &gt; memory of what the search mode yielded for them.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; This is exactly how I remember working on some of these passages.<br/>Of course, we had the &apos;luxury&apos; of playing the microtonal vocal lines<br/>on the Chromelodeon, so you could practice matching pitches, and then<br/>take it away. And then sing in context, as well as in the ultimate<br/>performance tempo.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; Some do and others don&apos;t. There are huge individual variations in<br/>&gt; &gt; this.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Humanity.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; Hindemith liked the idea of a tonal center, as do I.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; And drones exist throughout the world, etc. I think many, if not<br/>most of the significant musics, operate with some sense of &apos;gravity&apos;<br/>where you are pulled to a core value (be it a drone, or tonal center,<br/>or tonic chord, or whatever). It doesn&apos;t always have to be our<br/>Western harmony idea of a I chord, but something about us wants to<br/>return home, in some sense.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; I concur that singing and singability (no prejudice here, of<br/>&gt; &gt; course, being the singer that I am) is fundamental to the appeal<br/>of<br/>&gt; &gt; music to the extent of not being completely disposable even if<br/>not<br/>&gt; &gt; omnipresent where pitch-based music is concerned.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I can&apos;t entirely disagree with you, though I know from our<br/>discussions that I, for myself, am comfortable with musics that are<br/>considerably more chaotic and, I suppose, &apos;non-singable&apos;!<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; (I like the melodic tuning of percussion and the melodic nature<br/>&gt; &gt; of percussion performance as evidenced in Max Roach&apos;s album<br/>&gt; &gt; &quot;A Drum Also Waltzes&quot; and much African percussion.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Well, you&apos;ve picked a lovely example, Max indeed.

What some<br/>people call &quot;very good&quot; often differs from my definition. I<br/>frequently hear so-called world-class opera stars sing way off pitch.<br/>I do not consider such people to be good musicians. In the &quot;golden<br/>age&quot; of voice, singers had to be excellent musicians. They read<br/>wonderfully well, could play at least one instrument well, and they<br/>knew how to improvise, embellish, and understood the rules of<br/>counterpoint for current compositional practice. That would eliminate<br/>99%+ of today&apos;s singers.</p><p>Some may not care about pitch and argue that the off-pitch stars are<br/>wonderful singers, but being as off pitch as some are totally<br/>destroys any aesthetically positive reaction in me. It&apos;s like a<br/>painter who doesn&apos;t know how to use color well. In my book, that&apos;s<br/>not much of a painter. He/she should work in pencil, charcoal or<br/>whatever, but not watercolor or paint.</p><p>What I intended to convey was my expreience that a MUSICALLY TALENTED<br/>singer is much easier to train for just intonation than a singer who<br/>is not so musical. The variation in learning time is often enormous.</p><p>Francois:<br/>&gt; My feeling is that it is usually the extreme voices (soprano I and<br/>&gt; Bass II) who take the lead.</p><p>***<br/>Bob:<br/>I agree that the outer voices are more influential, and since the<br/>bass is the harmonic foundation as a rule, it is the very most<br/>crucial. Your basses must be in tune in a cappella singing, since<br/>everyone else is trained to tune justly to the bass part.</p><p>It is unfortunately typical for men to sing with a perpetual pitch<br/>offset to the flat side. This is sadly almost universal in American<br/>amateur choirs and often even professional ones. This can work for<br/>undiscriminating audiences when their is accompaniment, but it is<br/>death to a cappella, since a choir that is trained to adjust for pure<br/>harmonies will tune down to the bass, then the basses will tend to be<br/>flat to that. Even the slightest flat bias in your bass section will<br/>wreak havoc with pitch stability and the whole choir will rapidly<br/>drift &quot;south&quot; when singing a cappella.</p><p>Francois:<br/>I noted that realisation of some chords is<br/>&gt; different when one extreme voice crosses middle a voice (e.g. when<br/>&gt; soprano II goes above soprano I).</p><p>***<br/>Bob:<br/>Could be, but that would only be in the case that not all the singers<br/>have been trained to sing just intervals.</p><p>Jon to Bob, earlier:<br/>&gt; &gt; &quot;And would you need to rehearse slowly, to hear the harmonic<br/>&gt; &gt; movements in their purity, or do people start to click with the<br/>&gt; &gt; intervals and then proceed naturally?&quot;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; If my idea about &quot;uncertainty principle&quot; is correct, no wonder that<br/>&gt; long chords are necessary to expose the justness of the intonation.</p><p>***<br/>Bob:<br/>I have addressed this earlier above. I use difference tones as the<br/>basis for intonation training except for unisons and octaves, and<br/>they are orders of magnitude faster in yeilding the necessary<br/>information on tuning adjustments than beats between common<br/>harmonics.</p><p>&gt; Yours truly<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Fran&ccedil;ois Laferri&egrave;re</p></div><h3><a id=36916 href="#36916">ðŸ”—</a>Carl Lumma &#x3C;carl@lumma.org&#x3E;</h3><span>5/14/2002 11:51:43 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Francois wrote...</p><p> &gt;I do not know why &quot;ooh&quot; is the best phoneme.

There is a psychological phenomemon called masking that<br/>occurs whenever our perceptual apparatus, including the neurological<br/>components and processing in the brain, generates products that are<br/>not part of the primary objects of perception. Our brain learns to<br/>treast them as &quot;not there&quot;; just nulls them out. It therefore usually<br/>takes some training before people are able to hear them explicitly,<br/>and some never learn.</p><p>However, I have two approaches to get around this problem:</p><p>First, I use exercises I designed specifically to present the<br/>difference tone phenomenon in the simplest, most isolated, and<br/>exaggerated form possible.</p><p>Second, I have an electronic device that nulls out the two source<br/>tones and only allows the difference tones to be amplified and fed<br/>back to the ears through earphones. The singer sings tones against an<br/>electronic drone from a keyboard output and listens to the amplified<br/>difference tone, which I then attenuate gradually unitil it&apos;s gone.<br/>Then I turn the mic off without their noticing. They continue to hear<br/>the difference tones because they are still there acoustically, but<br/>not so isolated and exaggerated. In a word, I led them from an<br/>electronically exaggerated to a more normal acoustic situation.</p><p>The very act of putting our attention on hearing these difference<br/>tones familiarizes us with what I call the &quot;sweet spot&quot; that occurs<br/>between frequencies related by simple whole number rations (i.e.,<br/>just intervals). It is important to recognize that difference tones<br/>generated by frequencies in simple integer ration to each other are<br/>also related by simple integer ration to both source tones. I<br/>reinforce these difference tones by actually playing them under the<br/>reference drone and the justly tuned vocal pitches sung against them.</p><p>For a example, if we use C5 an octave above middle C as the drone, we<br/>can have the singers sing the F4 a fifth under, then move to G4 a<br/>fourth under, then A4 a minor third under. The difference tones these<br/>three tones generate with the C5 drone are F3, C3, and<br/>F2 respectively. I can use a standard 12-EDO electronic keyboard to<br/>reinforce this since the fifths are &quot;quasi-just&quot; at only two cents<br/>flat. IN this way, I can use the standard keyboards available<br/>everwhere by restricting simultaneously sounding keyboard pitches to<br/>octaves, fifths, and fourths, with vocalists filling in the thirds<br/>and sixths, etc.</p><p>This provides what I call &quot;leveraged&quot; feedback, since when a singer<br/>is off by three cycles per second at F4, this represents a relatively<br/>small pitch error from the ideal F4 the singer should be singing for<br/>a just tuning. However, the difference tone at F3 is also going to be<br/>three cycles per second off, but an octave lower, three cycles<br/>represents twice as much pitch error. If the A4 is off by three<br/>cycles per second, the F2 difference frequency will also be three<br/>cycles different from the reinforced difference tone we&apos;re playing on<br/>the keyboard and represents four times the pitch error at that<br/>frequency.</p><p>The first time I experimented with this using my choir, I was blown<br/>away at how they would, given a little time to adjust, all<br/>spontaneously gravitate to the justly tuned pitches with not verbal<br/>guidance as to how to move pitch or where to go. All I had to do was<br/>wait.</p><p>In real, practical performance we are seldom explicity aware of<br/>difference tones even after learning to hear them in this way, but we<br/>have become much more attuned intuitively to their presence and react<br/>to them anyway. Even those who never learn to recognize them<br/>explicitly in a pure acoustical context are able to quickly and<br/>easily adjust for pure JI intervals after receiving this training.</p><p>&gt;  &gt;explaining why accurate intervals can be discriminated at<br/>durations<br/>&gt;  &gt;much lower than the famous classical uncertainty principle would<br/>seem<br/>&gt;  &gt;to justify.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Also, the elimination of beats is not the only way to tune in JI.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;  &gt;I plan to post someday some rapid scales in thirds contrasting<br/>&gt;  &gt;Pythagorean, 12-EDO, and just intervals to demonstrate how obvious<br/>&gt;  &gt;the differences are for even very fast passages.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Looking forward to it!<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;  &gt;And don&apos;t forget that according to aeronautical engineers, bees<br/>&gt;  &gt;shouldn&apos;t be able to fly (unless they have come up with some new<br/>&gt;  &gt;theories recently of which I&apos;m unaware).<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Do you have a source on this?  I think it&apos;s an urban myth.  At least<br/>&gt; that&apos;s what my friend who used to work in aerospace said when I<br/>&gt; asked him last week.</p><p>***<br/>Bob:<br/>Could well be an urban rumor. I have no reliable source on this. The<br/>point is we don&apos;t always understand everthing, and but this should<br/>not artistic endeavors base on empirical methods that clearly work.<br/>That stands whether the illustration I chose is accurate or not.</p><p>&gt;  &gt;I never implied that being a very good soloist was enough. What<br/>some<br/>&gt;  &gt;people call &quot;very good&quot; often differs from my definition. I<br/>&gt;  &gt;frequently hear so-called world-class opera stars sing way off<br/>pitch.<br/>&gt;  &gt;I do not consider such people to be good musicians.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Well, I won&apos;t go that far, but a cappella vocal harmony is my<br/>favorite<br/>&gt; instrumentation, and as I&apos;ve said on metatuning, I don&apos;t like 99% of<br/>&gt; the vocal soloists that I hear.</p><p>***<br/>Bob:<br/>I do go that far. For me, if a person performing pitch-based music<br/>can&apos;t accurately reproduce the pitches the tuning of choice dictates,<br/>whatever that tuning may be, then that person is not competent as a<br/>musician to perform that music. Many singers today do not qualify as<br/>musicians, and many musicians implicity recognize this with<br/>statements like, &quot;Oh, he&apos;s not a musician. He&apos;s a singer.&quot; I am a<br/>singer, but I happen to believe singers should be musicians,<br/>otherwise even the word singer is a bit of a misnomer.<br/>&gt;</p><p>&gt; As an update to that thread on metatuning (which I&apos;m no longer<br/>subscribed<br/>&gt; to, BTW), I recently had my first experience preferring operatic<br/>style<br/>&gt; vocals to choir style vocals.  I got Hogwood&apos;s Messiah, and found<br/>that<br/>&gt; indeed, I was hooked on vibrato -- at least some vibrato -- for the<br/>&gt; Messiah.  I actually sold the Hogwood to a used-cd store.  Amazing!<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; -Carl</p><p>***<br/>Bob:<br/>I believe it is very unnatural to force singers to eliminate vibrato<br/>entirely. It is not necessary to precise intonation as long as the<br/>vibrato is not exaggerated. A good, healthy vocal vibrato consist<br/>mostly of intensity and timbre modulation on the order of 5 to 7<br/>cycles per second and very little pitch modulation. It is an<br/>essential tool of good vocal expression and only a very stiff,<br/>unnatural, and unhealthy vocal production can eliminate it entirely.</p></div><h3><a id=36926 href="#36926">ðŸ”—</a>robert_wendell &#x3C;rwendell@cangelic.org&#x3E;</h3><span>5/14/2002 7:38:18 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Carl, I just realized I didn&apos;t answer you first quesiton.</p><p>--- In tuning@y..., Carl Lumma &lt;carl@l...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt; Francois wrote...<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;  &gt;I do not know why &quot;ooh&quot; is the best phoneme.

I like to say a good singer lives, while<br/>singing, in a state of exhilarated suspension between breathing in<br/>and breathing out. This refined, delicately balanced internal posture<br/>of the vocal tract and breathing mechanism is based on a fine,<br/>vitalized but essentially relaxed tension between the opposing muscle<br/>systems involved in inhalation and exhalation, very much like what<br/>happens during laughter or the thrill and exhilaration felt just<br/>before the roller coaster plunges down the next hill. More on this<br/>after the next paragraph.</p><p>The answer to your query is that it is well known that differential<br/>tones are most easily recognized using relatively pure tones with<br/>almost sine-wave like qualities, that is, not very rich in harmonic<br/>structure, and a high degree of harmonicity in what structure there<br/>is. The &quot;ooh&quot; sound is the vowel that conforms best to this vocally.</p><p>Back to the pressure issue, I have seen vocal &quot;teachers&quot; who hold a<br/>lighted candle in front of a singer&apos;s mouth and try to get the singer<br/>to vocalize without blowing it out. They are supposedly<br/>teaching &quot;breath control&quot; this way. Absurd in the extreme!!!! This is<br/>based on total ignorance, and I do mean total, no matter whose toes<br/>I&apos;m stepping on (readers beware!).</p><p>This little trick originated as a TEST of already developed technique<br/>and has nothing to do with how to develop it. A good singer, contrary<br/>to what you will read in many a textbook, does not hold his glottal<br/>lips shut (often erroneously called &quot;vocal cords&quot;, an unfortunate<br/>misnomer, but I will go along with &quot;vocal folds&quot;) and then force air<br/>through them to produce a vocal tone. On the contrary, the glottal<br/>lips (more like membranes with internal musculature, which lips also<br/>have) are held in close approximation without closing them, just like<br/>the aperture between a clarinet&apos;s reed and the bouquette to which it<br/>is fastened.</p><p>The air is then passed between them and draws the tone out via the<br/>Bernoulli effect. That is, the air passing between them produces a<br/>suction that draws them together, breaking the partial vacuum, and<br/>the cycle begins anew. This is quite the opposite from squeezing the<br/>glottal lips together and cyclically bursting them apart with air.<br/>First, in the latter instance the pressure required to blow them<br/>apart is dependent on the arbitrary muscular force with which they<br/>are squeezed together.</p><p>In the extreme, this is an ugly grunt. At best, it is a mild grunt.<br/>This is not a very aesthetically pleasing way to sing and is damaging<br/>to the whole vocal mechanism, not to mention the prejudicial effects<br/>of unnecessary tension and muscular tightness in wrong places and the<br/>inevitable imbalance produced in the whole internal posture of the<br/>vocal tract and the entire breathing mechanism.</p><p>It is impossible to sing beautifully with this pushing approach. Of<br/>course, in most &quot;pop&quot; genres these days, beautiful singing is not at<br/>a premium at all. It unfortunately seems to embarrass many people to<br/>hear a truly beautiful vocal tone today, and with &quot;beautiful&quot; I&apos;m not<br/>referring to the silly, wide, wobbling vibratos of some opera singers.</p><p>Using the Bernoulli effect, however, to set the glottal lips into<br/>vibration imitates what happens, for example, in the clarinet. If the<br/>reed were in contact with the bouquette already, the musician<br/>wouldn&apos;t even be able to get any air through it, but would simply be<br/>creating pressure to close it even tighter. But since there is a gap,<br/>the player simply blows air through this gap and the reed is set into<br/>vibration through the Bernoulli effect. When a singer draws the sound<br/>out with the Bernoulli effect, this automatically optimizes all the<br/>parameters of good singing.</p><p>First, physics, rather than arbitrary muscular force squeezing the<br/>glottal lips together, determines just how much air the singer needs<br/>to actuate the desired tone and dynamic level. The Bernoulli effect<br/>intrinsically minimizes the amount of air needed for any given pitch<br/>and dynamic level, so the singer can last much longer without putting<br/>any attention whatsoever on breath control, but simply on maintaining<br/>the internal vocal posture that supports this style of vocalizing,<br/>which we can call Bernoulli phonation.</p><p>The rest is just like talking, during which we spontaneously and<br/>unconsciously meter just the right amount of air for our needs,<br/>assuming reasonably healthy vocal mechanisms and speech habits.<br/>Teaching &quot;breath control&quot; is like trying to get a centipede to think<br/>about the order in which it moves its hundred legs. It will probably<br/>roll over in the ditch in wonder and never walk again.</p><p>Before the advent of modern vocal science (which is only useful to<br/>vocal pedagogy when used to illuminate sound empirical principles<br/>that have been around and working beautifully well for centuries)<br/>they used to use poetic means to describe this. They talked in terms<br/>of &quot;swallowing the vowels&quot; or &quot;drinking the vowels&quot; or &quot;singing on<br/>the gesture of inhalation&quot;. All these poetic descriptions are simply<br/>attempts to communicate subjectively a technique that is objectively<br/>observable as Bernoulli phonation.</p><p>Rare is the voice teacher today who understands diddly about this and<br/>since those teachers ignorant of this clearly have a substantial<br/>vested interest in their own supposed &quot;expertise&quot;, they are loath to<br/>admit it has any importance whatsoever. This includes people in some<br/>very high places, as should be obvious from some of the pitifully<br/>inadequate soloists they choose to sing important roles in concerts<br/>and opera productions.</p><p>I can tell you, however, that those who do use this approach, and<br/>there are significant number if a small minority of people who do,<br/>develop over time tremendous range, vocal agility and power, and the<br/>ability to do amazing ornaments and coloratura embellishments of<br/>every kind that would be otherwise absolutely beyond reach. I seldom<br/>hear a singer today who can execute a truly clean whole step trill at<br/>a reasonable rate, for example.</p><p>The usual pitiful subsitute is a wide vibrato calibrated to place<br/>it&apos;s extremes on two pitches a whole tone apart. This is substituting<br/>garbage for what should be a clear, clean trill, and many are<br/>convinced that this is all anyone ever did historically. This<br/>thinking exists inevitably in a society of vocal &quot;professors&quot;<br/>(derived advisedly from the verb &quot;to profess&quot;) who teach vocal<br/>technique that eliminates out of hand the ability to ever execute a<br/>good, clean, clear trill of a whole step, or a good clean &quot;Caccini<br/>trillo&quot;, or any of the other ornaments the beautiful execution of<br/>which were the order of the day from the sixteenth century until the<br/>ninenteenth century.</p><p>More than you ever wanted to know about vocal technique?

But in practice dissipating sound energy require to compensate at<br/>the glottal source. When the vocal technique is good, it is right that<br/>the amount of air needed may be quite low, especially in mezzo-forte<br/>range. What is very disconcerting for beginners is that a good piano<br/>require much more air than mezzo-forte and that a good pianissimo<br/>require a HUGE amount of air, because the vocal folds must remain<br/>tense but more and more wide appart. What many people seems to ignore<br/>is that a very good pianissimo (for instance by a chorus) may be<br/>extremely SPECTACULAR.</p><p>I would be happy to know how to produce a good forte. Most singer<br/>simply increase the subglottal pressure to do so: that increases the<br/>emphasis on high frequencies (in other words, reduce the damping: the<br/>number of dB per octave reduction of the overall spectrum). That<br/>produce a &quot;shouting&quot; tone and usually reduce the capability to<br/>efficiently control the pitch.

I<br/>remember of reading a book of A. Tomatis who is considered to be an<br/>authority in orthophony. Almost everything he wrote on accoustics is<br/>ridiculous, all the curves he shows are outrageously wrong.<br/>Nevertheless he developped seemingly efficient therapies for various<br/>disorders. So I would not be so drastic in making all ill informed in<br/>physiology and accoustics, bad teachers (and conversely, an accoustic<br/>expert is not necessarilly a good voice teacher).</p><p>That remain true that there are a too many especially incompetent<br/>vocal &quot;teachers&quot; who are downright harmfull, but it is not the<br/>majority.</p><p>&gt; I can tell you, however, that those who do use this approach, and<br/>&gt; there are significant number if a small minority of people who do,<br/>&gt; develop over time tremendous range, vocal agility and power, and the<br/>&gt; ability to do amazing ornaments and coloratura embellishments of<br/>&gt; every kind that would be otherwise absolutely beyond reach.

Long time no talk (write?).

Difference tones occur whenever there is<br/>enough amplitude in the signal to cause non-linear response in the ear.<br/>Amplitude variation at a given frequency does not result in a sensation<br/>of pitch at that frequency.  It may result in something like side bands,<br/>I don&apos;t know.</p><p>A difference tone by itself cannot beat, it must beat against something<br/>else -- another difference tone, or a bass note.  I would think the rate<br/>of beating in such cases would be slower, not faster, than normal<br/>beating for a given rate of mistuning.  For example, if sopranos and<br/>altos sing a fifth between 450 and 300 Hz., the 1st-order difference tone<br/>of their fundamentals would be at 150 hz.  If the sopranos go sharp to<br/>455 Hz., there will be beating between their 1st partial and the altos&apos;<br/>2nd partial at the rate of 10 Hz.  The new diff. tone would be at 155 Hz.<br/>If the basses had been singing 150 Hz. all along, they would beat against<br/>this difference tone at 5 Hz.</p><p>It&apos;s tempting to appeal to the cancelation effects that give rise to<br/>beating to explain difference tones, but I think the latter are in<br/>fact caused by period-doubling of the resonators in the ear when driven<br/>by certain kinds of signals (esp. loud ones).

At least<br/>he would be here in the U.S. I do notice that fewer amateur choirs in<br/>Europe seem to have the &quot;going south&quot; and flat males syndromes so<br/>typical here even in semi-professional groups that put out recordings<br/>on commercial labels.</p><p>Francois earlier:<br/>&gt; We suffered for a few years from a pianist who was quite bad at<br/>&gt; understanding those principles, but we eventually got rid of him a<br/>&gt; year ago and made tremendeous progress since.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; Bob earlier:<br/>&gt; &gt; In proper vocal technique, there is very little air pressure in<br/>the<br/>&gt; &gt; first place, not to mention significant differences between<br/>vowels.<br/>&gt; &gt; There obviously has to be some difference in the internal pressure<br/>&gt; of<br/>&gt; &gt; the lungs and the air outside the body for there to be any airflow<br/>&gt; at<br/>&gt; &gt; all, but the difference in pressure needed to provide the<br/>extremely<br/>&gt; &gt; small rate of airflow a GOOD singer uses to produce a rather<br/>&gt; &gt; voluminous sound is quite low.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Theoritically, stationnary wave in a pipe do not require air flow at<br/>&gt; all. But in practice dissipating sound energy require to compensate<br/>at<br/>&gt; the glottal source. When the vocal technique is good, it is right<br/>that<br/>&gt; the amount of air needed may be quite low, especially in mezzo-forte<br/>&gt; range. What is very disconcerting for beginners is that a good piano<br/>&gt; require much more air than mezzo-forte and that a good pianissimo<br/>&gt; require a HUGE amount of air, because the vocal folds must remain<br/>&gt; tense but more and more wide appart. What many people seems to<br/>ignore<br/>&gt; is that a very good pianissimo (for instance by a chorus) may be<br/>&gt; extremely SPECTACULAR.</p><p>***<br/>Bob:<br/>Pianissimo should not pass unphonated air to be soft. This is a wrong<br/>way to reduce dynamic level, by simply shunting unphonated air<br/>through the glottal lips. Bernoulli phonation and good register<br/>coordination eliminate this, and the &quot;very good pianissimos&quot; become<br/>even more &quot;SPECTACULAR&quot; and conserve air for long phrases!</p><p>&gt; I would be happy to know how to produce a good forte. Most singer<br/>&gt; simply increase the subglottal pressure to do so: that increases the<br/>&gt; emphasis on high frequencies (in other words, reduce the damping:<br/>the<br/>&gt; number of dB per octave reduction of the overall spectrum). That<br/>&gt; produce a &quot;shouting&quot; tone and usually reduce the capability to<br/>&gt; efficiently control the pitch. That&apos;s why many amateur choirs have<br/>&gt; ugly fortissimo.</p><p>***<br/>Bob:<br/>It requires a fairly well-developed vocal coordination collectively<br/>in a choir to avoid the &quot;ugly fortissimo&quot;. The current incarnation of<br/>my choir (we have had some significant turnover due to moving, having<br/>babies, going back to school, you name it) is very refined at low<br/>levels and tends to go a bit toward ugly as we get really strong with<br/>dynamic levels.</p><p>Part of this is simply attention. They get what I call &quot;emotionally<br/>overheated&quot;, fall out of the driver&apos;s seat, and go off pitch. Pitch<br/>accuracy, once the ability to judge it independently has developed,<br/>becomes almost strictly a matter of attention to pitch in combination<br/>with vocal technique. Attention to pitch can even overcome bad vocal<br/>technique in terms of accuracy, but that is not an optimal solution,<br/>of course.</p><p>They&apos;re both very important. The &quot;shouting&quot; tone is mostly bad<br/>register coordination, often trying to push the heavier phonation<br/>sometimes called &quot;chest voice&quot; up too high or at least overbalancing<br/>lighter phonation at a given pitch and volume, combined with<br/>additional wrong internal vocal postures and the extraneous muscular<br/>tensions that go with that. It is death to good choral blend.</p><p>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; Bob:<br/>&gt; &gt; Back to the pressure issue, I have seen vocal &quot;teachers&quot; who hold<br/>a<br/>&gt; &gt; lighted candle in front of a singer&apos;s mouth and try to get the<br/>&gt; singer<br/>&gt; &gt; to vocalize without blowing it out. They are supposedly<br/>&gt; &gt; teaching &quot;breath control&quot; this way. Absurd in the extreme!!!! This<br/>&gt; is<br/>&gt; &gt; based on total ignorance, and I do mean total, no matter whose<br/>toes<br/>&gt; &gt; I&apos;m stepping on (readers beware!).<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I aggree with you that most vocal teacher are not sufficiently<br/>&gt; informed on physiology and accoustics. More should be done in<br/>musical<br/>&gt; education. Nevertheless some of them are able to produce efficent<br/>&gt; pedagogic images even though they are based on theoritical rubbish.<br/>I<br/>&gt; remember of reading a book of A. Tomatis who is considered to be an<br/>&gt; authority in orthophony. Almost everything he wrote on accoustics is<br/>&gt; ridiculous, all the curves he shows are outrageously wrong.<br/>&gt; Nevertheless he developped seemingly efficient therapies for various<br/>&gt; disorders. So I would not be so drastic in making all ill informed<br/>in<br/>&gt; physiology and accoustics, bad teachers (and conversely, an<br/>accoustic<br/>&gt; expert is not necessarilly a good voice teacher).</p><p>***<br/>Bob:<br/>Didn&apos;t intend to imply otherwise, Francois. I did say that vocal<br/>science is not useful except when it illuminates the in-some-corners-<br/>still-surviving and highly developed empirical methods that have<br/>worked wonderfully well for centuries. That implies directly that<br/>vocal science is not essential to teaching good singing, since<br/>Caccini, Monteverdi, and others had truly great singers around them,<br/>taught them and wrote for them.</p><p>Very few ensembles today are capable of doing more than making a sad<br/>and aesthetically disgusting joke of Monteverdi&apos;s more sophisticated<br/>and highly ornamental stuff. One notable exception is John Eliot<br/>Gardiner&apos;s recording on Deutsche Grammaphon of his &quot;Vespro della<br/>Beata Vergine&quot; of 1610 in the venue of its original performance in<br/>San Marcos in Venice. There is some really fantastic singing and<br/>wonderful examples of properly executed Caccini trillos and other<br/>virtuosic embellishments that are absolutely dependent on a very<br/>refined bel canto technique. I hesitate to use the term &quot;bel canto&quot;,<br/>though, since so many grossly misinterpret it.</p><p>And you&apos;re also right, of course, that good vocal science does not<br/>guarantee knowledge of good vocal technique. Absolutely not! This is<br/>even more obviously implied by my statement above about the value of<br/>vocal science.</p><p>Francois:<br/>&gt; That remain true that there are a too many especially incompetent<br/>&gt; vocal &quot;teachers&quot; who are downright harmfull, but it is not the<br/>&gt; majority.</p><p>***<br/>Bob:<br/>It would be a bit extreme to say the majority are &quot;downright<br/>harmful&quot;, unless you simply mean that they develop less than optimal<br/>vocal habits that are not necessarily damaging. Even then, that is<br/>dependent on how delicate or robust the individual mechanism happens<br/>to be. Good technique builds the voice in a literal, physical sense<br/>as well its proper use, hence the German term &quot;stimmbildung&quot; for what<br/>is essentially, at its best at least, just good bel canto technique.</p><p>At the finest level and for really clean agility in the performance<br/>of virtuosic embellishments and coloratura passages, the music simply<br/>is impossible to get right without virtually flawless vocal technique<br/>a la ancient bel canto school. Here, I make no apologies in saying<br/>that the VAST MAJORITY of vocal teachers today are clueless as to how<br/>to teach this and many MAJOR performers SIMPLY DO NOT HAVE THE<br/>TECHNICAL BASIS for doing this music well.</p><p>Monteverdi wrote coloratura passages for BASSES. It takes real know-<br/>how to teach basses to sing that way, but don&apos;t let anyone tell you<br/>it can&apos;t be done. If anyone tries, chalk them up as clueless.</p><p>Bob earlier:<br/>&gt; &gt; I can tell you, however, that those who do use this approach, and<br/>&gt; &gt; there are significant number if a small minority of people who<br/>do,<br/>&gt; &gt; develop over time tremendous range, vocal agility and power, and<br/>the<br/>&gt; &gt; ability to do amazing ornaments and coloratura embellishments of<br/>&gt; &gt; every kind that would be otherwise absolutely beyond reach. I<br/>seldom<br/>&gt; &gt; hear a singer today who can execute a truly clean whole step trill<br/>&gt; at<br/>&gt; &gt; a reasonable rate, for example.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; The usual pitiful subsitute is a wide vibrato calibrated to place<br/>&gt; &gt; it&apos;s extremes on two pitches a whole tone apart. This is<br/>&gt; substituting<br/>&gt; &gt; garbage for what should be a clear, clean trill, and many are<br/>&gt; &gt; convinced that this is all anyone ever did historically. This<br/>&gt; &gt; thinking exists inevitably in a society of vocal &quot;professors&quot;<br/>&gt; &gt; (derived advisedly from the verb &quot;to profess&quot;) who teach vocal<br/>&gt; &gt; technique that eliminates out of hand the ability to ever execute<br/>a<br/>&gt; &gt; good, clean, clear trill of a whole step, or a good<br/>clean &quot;Caccini<br/>&gt; &gt; trillo&quot;, or any of the other ornaments the beautiful execution of<br/>&gt; &gt; which were the order of the day from the sixteenth century until<br/>the<br/>&gt; &gt; ninenteenth century.<br/>&gt;<br/>Francois:<br/>&gt; Absolutely correct IMHO. It is a pity that Carl get rid of Hogwood&apos;s<br/>&gt; Messiah: it is excellent wrt to those ornementation aspects. and it<br/>is<br/>&gt; by far my favorite. By the way Carl, what operatic version do you<br/>&gt; propose?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; carl:<br/>&gt; &gt; I recently had my first experience preferring operatic style<br/>&gt; &gt; vocals to choir style vocals.  I got Hogwood&apos;s Messiah, and found<br/>&gt; that<br/>&gt; &gt; indeed, I was hooked on vibrato -- at least some vibrato -- for<br/>the<br/>&gt; &gt; Messiah.  I actually sold the Hogwood to a used-cd store.<br/>Amazing!<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; Bob:<br/>&gt; &gt; More than you ever wanted to know about vocal technique? The<br/>&gt; pressure<br/>&gt; &gt; thing hit a hot button that catapulted me onto my little soapbox<br/>&gt; &gt; (chuckle).<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I never have enough of your prose on vocal technique!!!!<br/>&gt;<br/>***<br/>Bob:<br/>Very kind of you, Francois!

Difference tones occur whenever there<br/>is<br/>&gt; enough amplitude in the signal to cause non-linear response in the<br/>ear.</p><p>Bob now:<br/>There is no conflict here, Carl. I just didn&apos;t give a complete<br/>explanation. I have an electronics and physics background, although I<br/>haven&apos;t used electronics knowledge professionally since 1982. Sum and<br/>difference tones occur when two frequencies are mixed in a non-linear<br/>device. In human beings this non-linearity has both physical and<br/>neurological components, and I understand there is also some<br/>neurological contribution that is not based on non-linear mixing.</p><p>The essential point remains intact, however. At low differences in<br/>frequency, there is simply a perception of variation in amplitude at<br/>the difference frequency, and we call this &quot;beating&quot;.<br/>Difference &quot;tones&quot; also occur at a frequency that is the difference<br/>of the two source frequencies. In order for these difference<br/>frequencies to be audible as &quot;tones&quot; the difference in frequency must<br/>correspond to a frequency that would generate an audible tone.</p><p>For example, when you sound C4 at middle C against the fifth above at<br/>G4, the difference frequency is at C3 an octave below the root at C4.<br/>No matter how you move two frequencies a P5 apart around, the<br/>difference tone will always be an octave below the lower tone. This<br/>is simply because 2:3 is the ration for a P5, and 3 - 2 = 1, and<br/>octave below 2. Simple, right?!</p><p>You do not need loud levels to generate enough non-linearity to hear<br/>difference tones. Have you read my recent posts on this completely<br/>where I explain the psychological masking phenomenon? I train my<br/>choir members to hear these tones at mezzo piano dynamic levels. I<br/>myself hear them all the time at these levels. They always occur<br/>where theory says they should. What more do we need? It works. Like<br/>gangbusters!</p><p>Cheers,</p><p>Bob</p><p>&gt; Amplitude variation at a given frequency does not result in a<br/>sensation<br/>&gt; of pitch at that frequency.  It may result in something like side<br/>bands,<br/>&gt; I don&apos;t know.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; A difference tone by itself cannot beat, it must beat against<br/>something<br/>&gt; else -- another difference tone, or a bass note.  I would think the<br/>rate<br/>&gt; of beating in such cases would be slower, not faster, than normal<br/>&gt; beating for a given rate of mistuning.  For example, if sopranos and<br/>&gt; altos sing a fifth between 450 and 300 Hz., the 1st-order<br/>difference tone<br/>&gt; of their fundamentals would be at 150 hz.  If the sopranos go sharp<br/>to<br/>&gt; 455 Hz., there will be beating between their 1st partial and the<br/>altos&apos;<br/>&gt; 2nd partial at the rate of 10 Hz.  The new diff. tone would be at<br/>155 Hz.<br/>&gt; If the basses had been singing 150 Hz. all along, they would beat<br/>against<br/>&gt; this difference tone at 5 Hz.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; It&apos;s tempting to appeal to the cancelation effects that give rise to<br/>&gt; beating to explain difference tones, but I think the latter are in<br/>&gt; fact caused by period-doubling of the resonators in the ear when<br/>driven<br/>&gt; by certain kinds of signals (esp. loud ones).  Paul and crew know<br/>much<br/>&gt; more about this than I do.  I&apos;m not sure when or why cancelation<br/>effects<br/>&gt; are no longer significant...<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;  &gt;Second, I have an electronic device that nulls out the two source<br/>&gt;  &gt;tones and only allows the difference tones to be amplified and fed<br/>&gt;  &gt;back to the ears through earphones. The singer sings tones<br/>against an<br/>&gt;  &gt;electronic drone from a keyboard output and listens to the<br/>amplified<br/>&gt;  &gt;difference tone, which I then attenuate gradually unitil it&apos;s<br/>gone.<br/>&gt;  &gt;Then I turn the mic off without their noticing. They continue to<br/>hear<br/>&gt;  &gt;the difference tones because they are still there acoustically,<br/>but<br/>&gt;  &gt;not so isolated and exaggerated. In a word, I led them from an<br/>&gt;  &gt;electronically exaggerated to a more normal acoustic situation.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; This sounds fascinating.  If Paul is around, I&apos;m sure he&apos;d love to<br/>&gt; hear about this.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;  &gt;It is important to recognize that difference tones generated by<br/>&gt;  &gt;frequencies in simple integer ration to each other are  also<br/>related<br/>&gt;  &gt;by simple integer ration to both source tones.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Right.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;  &gt;This provides what I call &quot;leveraged&quot; feedback, since when a<br/>singer<br/>&gt;  &gt;is off by three cycles per second at F4, this represents a<br/>relatively<br/>&gt;  &gt;small pitch error from the ideal F4 the singer should be singing<br/>for<br/>&gt;  &gt;a just tuning. However, the difference tone at F3 is also going<br/>to be<br/>&gt;  &gt;three cycles per second off, but an octave lower, three cycles<br/>&gt;  &gt;represents twice as much pitch error.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; So it isn&apos;t beating, but perceived pitch mismatch, that makes it<br/>work?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;  &gt;Could well be an urban rumor. I have no reliable source on this.<br/>The<br/>&gt;  &gt;point is we don&apos;t always understand everthing, and but this should<br/>&gt;  &gt;not artistic endeavors base on empirical methods that clearly<br/>work.<br/>&gt;  &gt;That stands whether the illustration I chose is accurate or not.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Agreed!<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Francois wrote...<br/>&gt;  &gt;It is a pity that Carl get rid of Hogwood&apos;s Messiah: it is<br/>excellent<br/>&gt;  &gt;wrt to those ornementation aspects. and it is by far my favorite.<br/>By<br/>&gt;  &gt;the way Carl, what operatic version do you propose?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I have four recordings of the Messiah, none of which I am completely<br/>&gt; pleased with:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Taverner Choir &amp; Players, Andrew Parrott (Virgin)<br/>&gt; Trinity Choir and Orchestra, Owen Burdick (Naxos)<br/>&gt; London Symphony Orchestra, Sir Colin Davis (Philips)<br/>&gt; Toronto Symphony, Andrew Davis (EMI)<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I haven&apos;t listened much to the Taverner or Trinity ones yet, as<br/>&gt; they&apos;re new.

From a digital theory<br/>viewpoint, when a linear transformation from time to frequency domain<br/>takes place, there is no such thing as beating: two near frequencies<br/>are resolved as individual if the analysis window is long enough. If<br/>the analysis window is too short, frequencies are not resolved, the<br/>amount of energy it contains depends on the location of the window on<br/>the time axis and it &quot;beats&quot; at f1-f2.

But looking more closely at actual a<br/>capella voices recording make this less obvious. Due to vibrato and<br/>other natural features of the voice, upper frequencies (let say above<br/>5-6th harmonics) are not very accurate and can probably not provide<br/>reliable beat. So the beat may be used (consciously or not) for<br/>interval such as 1:1, 1:2, 2:3, 4:3, 5:4, 6:5, but that become more<br/>doubtful for more complex ratios. Nevertheless good singers can<br/>produce very accurate ratios up to 24:25 and probably more !!

There is<br/>so much in those vesper that there is room for various good<br/>interpretations.</p><p>&gt; Bob:<br/>&gt; It would be a bit extreme to say the majority are &quot;downright<br/>&gt; harmful&quot;, unless you simply mean that they develop less than optimal<br/>&gt; vocal habits that are not necessarily damaging.</p><p>I heard first hand story about harmful teachers who made permanent<br/>dommage to the voice. I was thinking about this small but dangerous<br/>minority.</p><p>Fran&ccedil;ois Laferri&egrave;re</p></div><h3><a id=36955 href="#36955">ðŸ”—</a>Carl Lumma &#x3C;carl@lumma.org&#x3E;</h3><span>5/16/2002 10:45:06 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>&gt;A few months ago I was firmly thinking that the tuning of voices to JI<br/> &gt;ratio used, basically, the same technique as piano tuning, i.e. the<br/> &gt;beat of the common harmonics. But looking more closely at actual a<br/> &gt;capella voices recording make this less obvious. Due to vibrato and<br/> &gt;other natural features of the voice, upper frequencies (let say above<br/> &gt;5-6th harmonics) are not very accurate and can probably not provide<br/> &gt;reliable beat. So the beat may be used (consciously or not) for<br/> &gt;interval such as 1:1, 1:2, 2:3, 4:3, 5:4, 6:5, but that become more<br/> &gt;doubtful for more complex ratios. Nevertheless good singers can<br/> &gt;produce very accurate ratios up to 24:25 and probably more !! Even<br/> &gt;though I do not buy (yet) the differnce tone stuff, I feel that there<br/> &gt;are more complex mechanism at work than simple use of beat, but I do<br/> &gt;not know how this work.</p><p>I agree that the elimination of beats is not used (or at least,<br/>not the primary) way that a cappella singers tune in JI.  I&apos;ve always<br/>thought this.  I believe they are able to tune by minimizing<br/>dissonance.  There are two components of dissonance -- roughness, and<br/>harmonic entropy.</p><p>Roughness and beating are often confused, but they are independent.<br/>Beating, as I understand it, is a physical phenomenon caused by<br/>cancelation and reinforcement of sound pressure in the air.  It is<br/>how pianos are tuned, since counting of beats is the only way to<br/>precisely find irrational intervals by ear, and elimination of beats<br/>is the only way to get very accurate unisons.  Roughness is a<br/>psychoacoustic phenomenon caused by the inability of the ear to<br/>spectrally resolve frequencies that are too close together -- this<br/>has to do with the limitations of the basilar membrane.</p><p>Harmonic entropy is a psychoacoustic phenomenon caused by the inability<br/>of the brain to recognize patterns of nerve firings representing high-<br/>numbered ratios.  Just how high is a matter of some debate.</p><p>It is generally thought that periodicity effects (harmonic entropy)<br/>are not available to the ear for frequencies over 4 KHz. and that<br/>spectral effects (roughness) are dominant in this range.  While both<br/>spectral and periodicity effects are available below 4 KHz., there<br/>is reason to believe that periodicity is dominant.</p><p>I suspect that minimizing roughness is the primary way in which<br/>a cappella singers tune accurate JI.</p><p> &gt;By the way, is there a perception of beat when using pure sine tones<br/> &gt;with ratio slightly off 1:2, 2:3 and so on? If so that would be a good<br/> &gt;argument in favor of difference tone (and a big surprise for me).<br/> &gt;There is perhaps some litterature on that.</p><p>Again, beating occurs before sound ever reaches the ear, I think.<br/>Roughness does occur between pure tones, also.</p><p>-Carl</p></div><h3><a id=36957 href="#36957">ðŸ”—</a>emotionaljourney22 &#x3C;paul@stretch-music.com&#x3E;</h3><span>5/16/2002 1:02:37 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In tuning@y..., &quot;francois_laferriere&quot; &lt;francois.laferriere@o...&gt;<br/>wrote:</p><p>&gt; By the way, is there a perception of beat when using pure sine tones<br/>&gt; with ratio slightly off 1:2, 2:3 and so on?
