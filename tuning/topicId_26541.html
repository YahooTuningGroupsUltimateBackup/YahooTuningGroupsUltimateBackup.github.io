When you speak of &quot;Coherency&quot; in pitch sets, is this<br/>subjective<br/>&gt; or are there certain rules-of-thumb and criteria that you look for?</p><p>Basically, just that no pitches can be added, and no pitches can be<br/>removed, without ruining the scale.</p><p>&gt; 2.    Does your concept of Pitch Set Coherency (PSC from here on<br/>out)<br/>&gt; accord with Carl Lumma&apos;s &quot;diatonicity&quot;, in that the ear tends<br/>toward<br/>&gt; hearing scales as an abstracted harmonic series-like structure (if<br/>&gt; I&apos;m understanding  this correctly)?</p><p>I&apos;m not sure if this is the point you&apos;re referring to, but I don&apos;t<br/>agree with Carl that we always or even often tend to hear/construct<br/>melodies as harmonic series segments.</p><p>&gt; 3.    What are some attributes that to you define PSC?</p><p>One &quot;biggie&quot; is consonant-CS -- in other words, every interval that<br/>functions as a basic harmonic consonance in the scale (I&apos;m thinking<br/>music with chord progressions and a homophonic and/or polyphonic<br/>language) always subtends the same number of scale steps. For<br/>example, in the diatonic scale, a fourth always subtends four scale<br/>steps, a major third three, and a minor third three.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; 4.    Is &quot;transposability&quot; an attribute that you look for?</p><p>Yes, but as per the discussions on this that Robert Valentine and I<br/>had here, I&apos;m more flexible about what this can mean than he is.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; 5.    Are many recognizable fifths a criteria?</p><p>I&apos;m willing to be flexible on this but the desire for similarity of<br/>melodic segments at a 4:3 or 3:2 apart is strong (in this one).</p><p>&gt; 6.    In a melodic sense and style of music where melody is the<br/>&gt; primary focus, what do you look for as far as PSC?</p><p>If there isn&apos;t much in the way of functional harmonic progression,<br/>then most of the &quot;consonant&quot; intervals aren&apos;t even going to occur as<br/>simultaneities, so one has much greater leeway in tuning . . . almost<br/>an &quot;anything goes&quot; scenario if you can make musical sense with the<br/>given resources.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; 7.    When harmony is the primary focus, what should one be looking<br/>&gt; for as far as PSC?</p><p>Hmm . . . without melody as a guiding principle, the sense<br/>of &quot;missing&quot; or &quot;extra&quot; notes in the scale may be lost, so the CS<br/>stuff mail not be as relevant . . . I&apos;d look for a connected chunk of<br/>the lattice -- Wilson&apos;s CPS scales fall into this category.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; 8.    Can you give me two or three examples of tunings and or modes<br/>&gt; that to you display PSC?</p><p>In 9-tET, two fine examples are the Pelog (1 3 1 1 3) and Augmented<br/>(1 2 1 2 1 2) scales -- they work amazingly convincingly considering<br/>that the 3:2 is approximated by only 666.67 cents!</p><p>&gt; 9.    What are some modes of 22, 31 and tET that would qualify as<br/>&gt; having PSC?</p><p>The meantone diatonics and pentatonics in 31, the septimal diatonics<br/>and pentatonics in 22, the decatonics in 22, the 11-tone chain-of<br/>minor-thirds in 31 . . . One blues mode in 22 that plays nicely on<br/>the edge of PSC is 6 3 1 3 6 3, where the two notes separated by 1<br/>degree can be thought of either as variants of the same note (making<br/>the scale consonant-CS), or as distinct notes, for the effect of<br/>a &quot;micro-chromatic&quot; figuration.</p><p>P.S. other than the blues mode, all of the scales mentioned in my<br/>responses to questions 8 and 9 above are mentioned without regard to<br/>which mode is used. As you know, I have different ideas about<br/>tonality, but PSC is a &quot;pre-tonal&quot; consideration for me.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; 10.    Do you feel at all that musical context, style, timbres,<br/>&gt; melodic (and or) harmonic needs for a given musical setting will<br/>best<br/>&gt; define what is needed as far as PSC, or are there overall general<br/>&gt; things that you tend to look for?</p><p>A bit of both, perhaps.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; 11.    Does your 72 tET &quot;Blackjack&quot; mode display PSC, and could you<br/>&gt; speak about its attributes in this regard?</p><p>Does it display PSC? Yes and no. Yes because it&apos;s fully CS. No<br/>because it&apos;s quite improper. Harmonically, a big yes because of all<br/>the consonant chords. Melodically, a big no because of the large<br/>number of notes (21). But that&apos;s OK because there seems to be a good<br/>variety of subsets (5-, 7-, and 10-tone ones, maybe others) that can<br/>carry the melodic coherence, while the harmonization might draw more<br/>freely from the full 21 . . . in particular, since the 33-cent<br/>inflections would tend not to be noticed as such when occuring non-<br/>consecutively in various voices within the harmonization, one might<br/>say that a 10-tone framework (i.e., Graham Breed&apos;s notational<br/>symbols, ignoring accidentals) could emerge as a structure giving<br/>effective coherency to the full set.</p></div><h3><a id=26546 href="#26546">ðŸ”—</a>jpehrson@rcn.com</h3><span>7/30/2001 5:57:10 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In tuning@y..., &quot;Paul Erlich&quot; &lt;paul@s...&gt; wrote:</p><p><a href="/tuning/topicId_26541.html#26541">/tuning/topicId_26541.html#26541</a></p><p>&gt;<br/>&gt; Does it display PSC?

Should I interpret you here to mean that PSC is a<br/>&gt; highly &quot;melodic&quot; consideration?</p><p>Nope! See above about melodic considerations. By pre-tonal I mean,<br/>without regard to which tone (if any) may ultimately be able to<br/>function as a tonal center (tonic). For example, the diatonic scale<br/>was used harmonically, but not yet tonally, in Western music before<br/>the 17th century. The major and minor modes were not especially<br/>interesting until the advent of tonality!</p><p>P.S. Don&apos;t be scared of the 666.67 fifths of 9-tET. They&apos;re quite<br/>beautiful melodically in the context of the scales I mentioned.</p></div>
