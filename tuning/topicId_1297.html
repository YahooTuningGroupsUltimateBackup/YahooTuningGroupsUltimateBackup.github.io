In appendix E it gives a formula for dissonance<br/>of two pure sine waves, but no particular explanation of why that formula<br/>should be the way it is. Are the exponents used based on some abstract<br/>idea, or are they simply the result of measurement?</p><p>The curves come from the experiments of Plomp and Levelt.<br/>The form of the equations (as a difference<br/>between two exponentials), is unique to TTSS.  By choosing the parameters,<br/>(using a least squares fit) it is possible to make this formula match the data<br/>quite accurately. So the formula is derived from experiment,<br/>which has been confirmed several times in different settings<br/>(e.g., Kameoka and Kuriygawa)</p><p>&gt;Also, I seem to recall it saying in Roederer that<br/>the region of dissonance is farther away and wider in bass notes.</p><p>Yes, this is true. Sensory dissonance is tied roughly to the critical band.<br/>This is incorporated into the equations in the &quot;s&quot; and &quot;f&quot; parameters,<br/>which essentially make the basic curve shape wider at lower frequencies<br/>and narrower at higher frequencies.</p><p>With this said, observe that most of the &quot;theorems&quot; in the appendix<br/>use a simpler model in which the &quot;s&quot; and &quot;f&quot; parameters are jetisoned,<br/>and a single curve is assumed for all frequencies. Thus the corresponding<br/>reults must be considered only approximatley true over a broader<br/>frequency range.</p></div>
