I like the sound of it melodically.  What does<br/>&gt; that have to do with consonance judgements (which I thought<br/>&gt; your character families were all about).</p><p>Character families are just what they say they are- intervals of<br/>related character, colors, affects, hue, etc. They relate to<br/>consonance and dissonance by virtue of being more or less pleasing,<br/>soft, etc. This implies that there is a subjective element to<br/>consonance and dissonance, but that&apos;s hardly a radical statement.</p><p>So, I believe that this feeling of character in an interval can<br/>overpower things like proximity to a simple interval. Even two tones<br/>of identical pitch can sound radically different, of course, one<br/>harsh and one sweet, so it seems perfectly reasonable to me that,<br/>for example, if we&apos;ve got two pitches very close to each other in<br/>the immediate neighborhood of simpler interval, and they&apos;re set<br/>against another tone, making a diad, it&apos;s possible that one is going<br/>to be reinforcing some partials in the accompanying tone and making<br/>the uebertimbre :-) more sweet than the other, almost identical (in<br/>cps), tone does. And thus it is possible, for example, that a M3 of<br/>395 cents could be sweeter than one of 392 cents.</p><p>&gt; Did you come up with this strictly by listening, or did<br/>&gt; you use numbers in some way?<br/>&gt; How many other character families are there?  A comparison<br/>&gt; might be helpful.</p><p>Both. I stumbled across 81/70, which Scala lists as a historical<br/>interval, and wanted to make a tuning with that general character.<br/>I had 28/27 in the beginning because I had arrived at 81/70 by<br/>monkeying with Arcytas&apos; enharmonic. 28/27 sounded like the wrong<br/>color, and too small to boot. 24/23 was the right size, but wrong<br/>color.</p><p>So I simply did an x/70 the same size as 24/23, and there it was.<br/>I say &quot;same size&quot; because a cent or two here and there isn&apos;t what&apos;s<br/>important. I would never claim to be able to hear a 1.4 cent<br/>difference, though you and I clearly did in Aaron&apos;s test, because<br/>putting it that way implies a perception of size, and my perception<br/>of size is simply not consistently so keen as to percieve 1.4 cents.<br/>I heard a change in character, which clued me to the change in size.</p><p>Anyway, I imagined an appropriate... ? second? Whatever, something<br/>somewhere in the region of 150 cents. With &quot;70&quot; describing at least<br/>one part of the family, and all &quot;numbers&quot; being references to<br/>partials, I felt confident that 35/32 would fly, and it did.</p><p>I do try to keep intervals simple because I believe that that is<br/>PART of consonance, for the simple reason that this is all about<br/>references to partials, and once you get so high...hmmm, at some<br/>point, it seems to me, you&apos;re going to be approximating a simpler<br/>interval. Where this happens, I don&apos;t know, but it&apos;s pretty high.</p><p>Lessee... I just tested 81/70 against 8/7. The difference in<br/>character is a lot more than the 81/80 size difference would<br/>suggest- 8/7 is definitely a broad second, while 81/70 is<br/>a &quot;consonant interval&quot; in the style of 196/169.</p><p>So, EDL and equal-harmonics? whatever it&apos;s called, x/70 in this<br/>example, are very conducive to cohesiveness BUT they don&apos;t do it<br/>automatically, it&apos;s some kind of interaction between N + D. You can<br/>get some real stems and seeds in your grass doing EDL mechanically,<br/>for example. This is another thing I can only determine by listening.</p><p>And throughout the process I check all the difference tones. The<br/>tuning produced by the difference tones is what I call the<br/>shadow tuning and is the basis of my contrapuntal &quot;shadow harmony&quot;.<br/>This tuning, &quot;gingko&quot;, isn&apos;t so hot this way, I did another tuning<br/>of a similar cast, around 196/169, and its shadow tuning is<br/>extremely cohesive. In general, cohesive tuning, cohesive shadow<br/>tuning, not surprisingly.</p><p>The first piece on my zebox site, &quot;Acacia&quot;, is done this way, I&apos;ll<br/>get some more pieces soon. The tuning of the melody is very 23-heavy<br/>so to speak, lots of x/23, and the accompaniment is<br/>entirely &quot;shadows&quot;, ie, in an irregular tuning made of difference<br/>tones.</p><p>Now, my own response to all this a couple of years ago would have<br/>been- makes sense but doesn&apos;t this heavily rely on things going on<br/>in really high partials? To which I would reply, come on over and<br/>test for yourself with additive synthesis and filters just how much<br/>you actually take in higher partials, I&apos;m amazed by it daily.</p><p>I find that there are brute realities related to absolute cps. I<br/>believe and can &quot;prove&quot; to my own sastifaction that partials above,<br/>say 4kHz? work in very, very broad brushstrokes, and the vast<br/>majority of what all makes character families is either happening<br/>literally in the first few dozen partials, or referencing those<br/>first ones by octave.</p><p>The typical number of 64 partials available in<br/>an additive synth isn&apos;t just a practical matter or dictated by<br/>technology- it&apos;s about right, everything above that is gravy. It&apos;s<br/>also amazing what you can do with just 32 partials- my experience<br/>with additive synthesis leads me to believe that above here we&apos;re<br/>already in broader brushtroke, &quot;tinting&quot;, and reinforcing of lower<br/>partials, not making deep character determinations.</p><p>One more thing: all this is far less dependant on the timbres of the<br/>individual instruments than I thought it would be. The uebertimbre<br/>is quite resilient. You can help or hurt by using sounds heavy on<br/>appropriate timbres, but it&apos;s not the main thing. For example, in my<br/>x/169 timbre, I turn up the 13th partial in the additive synth, and<br/>it&apos;s makes for a little more consonance, it seems, but the overall<br/>character is the same when using a 1/n sawtooth. This leads me to<br/>believe that we do have a built in sense of &quot;ideal&quot; proportions,<br/>much in the same way that we percieve of a pizza as round, although<br/>if petrified and used as a unicycle wheel, it would obviously make<br/>for a bumpy ride.</p><p>-Cameron Bobro</p></div><h3>Carl Lumma &#x3C;clumma@yahoo.com&#x3E;</h3><span>2/23/2007 8:40:49 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>&gt; &gt; I thought we were talking about consonance!!<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I&apos;ve been refering to cohesion more than consonance,</p><p>What does this mean?</p><p>&gt; and character<br/>&gt; families more than individual characters, mostly we&apos;d want a<br/>&gt; gradation in consonance, or?</p><p>What does *this* mean?</p><p>&gt; &gt; &gt;   0:          1/1               0.000<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt;   1:         73/70             72.650<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt;   2:         35/32            155.140<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt;   3:         81/70            252.680<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt;   4:        729/560           456.590<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt;   5:        146/105           570.695<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt;   6:        219/140           774.605<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt;   7:        105/64            857.095<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt;   8:        243/140           954.635<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt;   9:          2/1            1200.000<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; Cool scale.  I like the sound of it melodically.  What does<br/>&gt; &gt; that have to do with consonance judgements (which I thought<br/>&gt; &gt; your character families were all about).<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Character families are just what they say they are- intervals of<br/>&gt; related character, colors, affects, hue, etc. They relate to<br/>&gt; consonance and dissonance by virtue of being more or less pleasing,<br/>&gt; soft, etc. This implies that there is a subjective element to<br/>&gt; consonance and dissonance, but that&apos;s hardly a radical statement.</p><p>When you look at consonance (or whatever you want to call it),<br/>you immediately find something shocking: people of all ages and<br/>from a number of different cultures tend to agree that the same<br/>basic consonances are consonant (or that they sound different<br/>from any old intervals).  This is a phenomenon worth trying to<br/>explain, don&apos;t you think?</p><p>&gt; So, I believe that this feeling of character in an interval can<br/>&gt; overpower things like proximity to a simple interval.</p><p>On what do you base this belief?</p><p>&gt; And thus it is possible, for example, that a M3 of<br/>&gt; 395 cents could be sweeter than one of 392 cents.</p><p>In all my time experimenting with these things, tuning<br/>pianos and so forth, I have never found this to be the<br/>case.  I don&apos;t believe it&apos;s true for any natural timbre<br/>in the ordinary musical register where the third is<br/>voiced as a tenth when the fundamental is below F3 or so.</p><p>&gt; &gt; Did you come up with this strictly by listening, or did<br/>&gt; &gt; you use numbers in some way?<br/>&gt; &gt; How many other character families are there?  A comparison<br/>&gt; &gt; might be helpful.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Both. I stumbled across 81/70, which Scala lists as a historical<br/>&gt; interval, and wanted to make a tuning with that general character.<br/>&gt; I had 28/27 in the beginning because I had arrived at 81/70 by<br/>&gt; monkeying with Arcytas&apos; enharmonic. 28/27 sounded like the wrong<br/>&gt; color, and too small to boot. 24/23 was the right size, but wrong<br/>&gt; color.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; So I simply did an x/70 the same size as 24/23, and there it was.</p><p>How&apos;d you come up with 70?</p><p>&gt; I say &quot;same size&quot; because a cent or two here and there isn&apos;t<br/>&gt; what&apos;s important. I would never claim to be able to hear a 1.4<br/>&gt; cent difference, though you and I clearly did in Aaron&apos;s test,<br/>&gt; because putting it that way implies a perception of size, and<br/>&gt; my perception of size is simply not consistently so keen as to<br/>&gt; percieve 1.4 cents.  I heard a change in character, which<br/>&gt; clued me to the change in size.</p><p>Right.  There&apos;s nothing controversial in any of this bit since<br/>you mentioned 81/70.</p><p>&gt; Anyway, I imagined an appropriate... ? second? Whatever, something<br/>&gt; somewhere in the region of 150 cents. With &quot;70&quot; describing at<br/>&gt; least one part of the family, and all &quot;numbers&quot; being references<br/>&gt; to partials, I felt confident that 35/32 would fly, and it did.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I do try to keep intervals simple because I believe that that is<br/>&gt; PART of consonance, for the simple reason that this is all about<br/>&gt; references to partials, and once you get so high...hmmm, at some<br/>&gt; point, it seems to me, you&apos;re going to be approximating a simpler<br/>&gt; interval. Where this happens, I don&apos;t know, but it&apos;s pretty high.</p><p>I think it may be instructive if you tried to pin that down.</p><p>&gt; Lessee... I just tested 81/70 against 8/7. The difference in<br/>&gt; character is a lot more than the 81/80 size difference would<br/>&gt; suggest- 8/7 is definitely a broad second, while 81/70 is a<br/>&gt; &quot;consonant interval&quot; in the style of 196/169.</p><p>Have you ever tried irrational intervals?</p><p>&gt; So, EDL and equal-harmonics? whatever it&apos;s called, x/70 in<br/>&gt; this example,</p><p>EDL gives constant/x ratios, I believe.  I don&apos;t know the<br/>Mohajeri acronym for harmonics.</p><p>&gt; And throughout the process I check all the difference tones.<br/>&gt; The tuning produced by the difference tones is what I call<br/>&gt; the shadow tuning and is the basis of my contrapuntal &quot;shadow<br/>&gt; harmony&quot;.</p><p>Kraig Grady has done a ton of work with this.

This is a phenomenon worth trying to<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; explain, don&apos;t you think?<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>--- Cameron replied testily<br/>&gt; &gt; Yes, we&apos;re off on different tracks, because this is not only &quot;no<br/>&gt; &gt; kidding&quot;, it&apos;s been assumed in the discussion we were having.<br/>&gt;<br/>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, Carl asked unecessarily:</p><p>&gt; What do you think, at any rate?</p><p>I&apos;ve been saying, and more importantly, doing, what I think this<br/>whole time. Of course in this unseemly tangle of threads you may<br/>miss half of it.</p><p>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; So, I believe that this feeling of character in an interval<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; can overpower things like proximity to a simple interval.<br/>--- Cameron opined cheerfully</p><p>&gt; &gt; &gt; On what do you base this belief?<br/>--- Carl queried belligerently</p><p>--- to which Cameron replied, puzzled<br/>&gt; &gt; Direct experience and the experience of others, what else?</p><p>&gt; Direct experience is unfortunately quite fallable unless<br/>&gt; you are very very careful.<br/>--- intoned Carl pompously</p><p>Our senses are very keen, it&apos;s the interpretation of experience that<br/>is quite fallible. If you simply chalk up certain experiences over a<br/>period of years, without any idea what causes them, without any plan<br/>and remembering them for no reason other than &quot;oh that sounds nice&quot;,<br/>neither knowing or caring if they confirm or condradict some theory,<br/>it&apos;s probably a pretty sound body of experiences. That&apos;s the nature<br/>of my experience in this matter- for example, the game where two<br/>people sing a unison or a fifth then you take turns going up and<br/>down in as tiny steps as you can and trip out on the different<br/>effects. Within less than a semitone&apos;s range you get satanic sounds,<br/>angelic sounds, sci-fi sounds. And detuning one analog oscillator<br/>against another- within 20 cents you get the fluttering sounds, the<br/>creamy ones, the hard ones, the ones that sound like they&apos;re made of<br/>wood (my favorite).</p><p>--- Cameron noted thoughtfully:<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Lessee... I just tested 81/70 against 8/7. The difference in<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; character is a lot more than the 81/80 size difference would<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; suggest- 8/7 is definitely a broad second, while 81/70 is a<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &quot;consonant interval&quot; in the style of 196/169.</p><p>--- Carl said annoyingly, hastily changing the subject:<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; Have you ever tried irrational intervals?<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>--- Cameron retorted tiredly:<br/>&gt; &gt; Not really. Why bother?</p><p>&gt; You might learn something.<br/>--- Carl said condescendingly</p><p>Sorry, I thought you meant, have I tried irrational intervals in my<br/>shadow tunings. Of course I&apos;ve tried irrational intervals in<br/>general, I even have a pretty entertaining tuning method based on a<br/>colorful concept which kind of pokes fun at the whole idea of<br/>rational/irrational.</p><p>---- Okay, okay! Just kidding around. Anyway, it&apos;s easy to see who<br/>----wrote what, the words of gentle wisdom clad in Nabokovian<br/>----negligee are mine of course</p><p>&gt; Did I say koto.  I meant kora!</p><p>A friend called the sound in the second part a koto.<br/>I imagine some kind of vague cimbalom because I listened to that<br/>instrument so much as a child.

As I said, my son at 8 months sang<br/>in perfect octaves with me. Have I mentioned that when he would<br/>strum the open strings of my guitar, which is tuned to pure fourths<br/>all the way up, he would sing melodies which wandered through the<br/>first partials of the open strings?</p><p>I lost the only recording I had, about 15 seconds long, when moving<br/>the studio. Let me tune it up in Scala... yes, that&apos;s it, I&apos;m<br/>completely transported, whoo-hoo! And there&apos;s the description of the<br/>microtonal inflection he would consistently do, which had me<br/>puzzled: a lilting syntonic comma downward (he never did it upward<br/>as far as I know, for whatever reason).</p><p>I&apos;ll post the .scl when I get the music laptop upstairs, there&apos;s no<br/>wireless in the studio. It&apos;s just ascending 4/3s with 3/2&apos;s and<br/>5/4&apos;s on top of each one.</p><p>Anyway, shall I cut and paste every thing I&apos;ve ever written here?</p><p>It&apos;s plain as day that I believe that perception of cononsance and<br/>character is directly related the harmonic series.</p><p>Now, can you explain to me why four of eight people found a ~710<br/>cent fifth to be more &quot;fifth&quot; sound and consonant than a ~708 cent<br/>fifth, why you found a triad with 19/15 as a third more consonant<br/>than one with 81/64, why 81/70 is audibly in an interval class<br/>different from either 8/7 and 7/6, and why 196/169 is such a<br/>consonant interval?</p><p>My explanation is Occam-stylee bonehead simple: our perception of<br/>consonance, character, and cohesion comes straight out of the<br/>harmonic series, and what&apos;s &quot;simple&quot; for us, simply, extends beyond<br/>something like N*D&lt;40.</p><p>Simple ratios are nothing new to me, I first learned about them<br/>years ago (from Lou Harrison, in Capitola, California, that&apos;s<br/>probably some entertaining &quot;six degrees of seperation&quot; stuff for<br/>some here).
