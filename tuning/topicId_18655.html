(Some folks expressed<br/>interest in seeing them.)<br/>They are in the folder labeled &quot;MSP&quot; owned by &quot;mode501&quot; (my Yahoo name.)<br/>In order to run the things, you of course have to have MAX/MSP on Mac.<br/>then you pretty much have to download all of those files.<br/>(sorry--shouldn&apos;t take too long.)   Then follow the instructions: refer to<br/>the file called &quot;instructs,&quot; a readme Simpletext file. (make<br/>sure MAX is looking for sub-patches in the directory where you put the<br/>stuff).   run the patch &quot;everything&quot;.</p><p>I emphasize that this was just some preliminary experimentation I was<br/>doing---not a finished product of any sort.   I&apos;d be overjoyed if someone<br/>wanted to take things further.    Frankly, I wasn&apos;t too excited about the<br/>sounds I was getting out---either timbrally, or in terms of the scales<br/>that were resulting.</p><p>At some point, I&apos;ll get back to actually writing some music with this, but<br/>my plate&apos;s full with other compositional work at the moment. . . .</p><p>If anyone has any questions, ask away.</p><p>CB</p></div>
