The difference between this and 31edo is subtle, but you<br/>&gt;  can bring it out, eg by using two-part harmony. What Vicentino<br/>&gt;  would have made of it I don&apos;t know.</p><p>Hi, Gene!</p><p>My guess is that Vicentino would accept this as one nuance of his<br/>first archicembalo tuning: the fifthtone or enharmonic diesis<br/>steps are all large enough (at least 35 cents so so), and the<br/>subtle gradations are an interesting variation on either<br/>1/4-comma (where we get two sizes of an interval type<br/>differing by 6.07 cents) or 31-EDO (with a single size for<br/>each).</p><p>And I&apos;d say it&apos;s a fine 31-note circle, as well as a very<br/>creative one!</p><p>So we get a compromise between the variety of circulating<br/>1/4-comma and the greater accuracy of 31-EDO for 11/9, for<br/>example.</p><p>What Vicentino or others were likely to tune by ear in the 16th<br/>century is another question; but I&apos;d say that if 31-EDO is<br/>legitimate, and Lemme Rossi took it as the correct tuning in<br/>1666, then this is, too!</p><p>Congratulations!</p><p>Peace and love,</p><p>Margo</p></div><h3><a id=105324 href="#105324">ðŸ”—</a>genewardsmith &#x3C;genewardsmith@...&#x3E;</h3><span>11/8/2012 8:44:03 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, Margo Schulter &lt;mschulter@...&gt; wrote:</p><p>&gt; And I&apos;d say it&apos;s a fine 31-note circle, as well as a very<br/>&gt; creative one!</p><p>Thanks, Margo.</p></div>
