I listened<br/>to it, and was put off by the fact that 9 steps barely approximates 5/4<br/>better than 10.  After listening more, I&apos;m willing to include it (9 is best).</p><p>I was really looking for chords that were improving as I went higher up.<br/>But I did say &quot;usable&quot; and I did include 15 and 22, so to be fair I should<br/>also add 27, which beats 29, and 25, which is hardly worse than 12.  26<br/>doesn&apos;t cut it.</p><p>25 has a killer 4:5:7 chord, but it isn&apos;t 7-limit consistent, and adding<br/>the :6 makes me want to raise the :7 a step...</p><p>Of course 43, 46, 49, and 50 should be in there, and probably others are as<br/>good as 15...  but I do have a day job.</p><p>[Kees van Prooijen]<br/>&gt;I miss 34 with just this chord.</p><p>Wow!  I can&apos;t believe I forgot 34, which has always been very interesting<br/>on paper.  I plugged it in, and was thrilled to find it is about as good as<br/>53.  Much better than 41 or 31.  Add to that its near-perfect minor triad,<br/>and I think that it is as good as 53 for 5-limit work.</p><p>The only bummer with this ET is that it is only consistent thru the<br/>5-limit, and I checked for acceptable 4:5:6:7&apos;s, and there weren&apos;t any.</p><p>So here&apos;s the updated list.  Gaps indicate a big change.</p><p>15<br/>25<br/>12<br/>29<br/>27</p><p>22<br/>19<br/>31<br/>41</p><p>34<br/>53</p><p>I should mention that I am using a highly idealized environment here.  In a<br/>band situation, maybe 26 would do, I don&apos;t know...</p><p>It would be neat to have others confirm or deny this ranking.  I have used<br/>Midi Relay and the GM Reed Organ patch, recording into Cool Edit for the<br/>comparo.  All :4&apos;s were fixed to middle</p><p>C.</p></div>
