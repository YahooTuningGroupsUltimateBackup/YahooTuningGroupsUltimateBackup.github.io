The oldest known<br/>&gt; musical score, it takes the form of interval names and number<br/>&gt; signs, and even has lyrics.  The text is identified as a hymn<br/>&gt; to the moon goddess Nikkal.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; There is some controversy among ancient musicologists over the<br/>&gt; proper interpretation of the notes, but all agree that it is a<br/>&gt; genuine musical score.</p><p>Troubledoor then gives the URLs containing interpretations by<br/>M. L. West:</p><p><a href="http://members.aol.com/jazzdd/index.htm/westhuri.htm">http://members.aol.com/jazzdd/index.htm/westhuri.htm</a></p><p>and A. D. Kilmer:</p><p><a href="http://www.webster.sk.ca/greenwich/EVIDENCE.HTM">http://www.webster.sk.ca/greenwich/EVIDENCE.HTM</a></p><p>I&apos;m stunned that someone else should post precisely these links<br/>at this particular time at *my* favorite cyber-hangout, because<br/>I&apos;ve been very deeply involved in research into these matters<br/>for the last two months.</p><p>I had prepared a post to the List exactly one month ago that<br/>I never submitted, because the webpages to which I wanted to refer<br/>are not yet ready and, indeed, I do not feel that I have yet<br/>gathered enough evidence to support my speculations about these<br/>documents, and in fact I&apos;m not at all sure yet that my<br/>interpretations are correct.  In particular, my conception<br/>of the basic scale may be totally wrong... but I&apos;m accepting<br/>it for now, until I dig more deeply.</p><p>To say that &apos;there is some controversy&apos; about the proper<br/>reconstruction of this piece is a vast understatement: since<br/>the first recognition that this tablet contained musical content,<br/>by H. G. Gu&quot;terbock in 1970 (Revue d&apos;Assyriologie), there have<br/>been no less than 9 different attempts at reconstruction, varying<br/>wildly:</p><p>1971 David Wulstan<br/>1974 A. D. Kilmer<br/>1976 M. Duchesne-Guillemin<br/>1977, 1978 Thiel<br/>1982 Raoul Vitale<br/>1982 M. Duchesne-Guillemin<br/>1988 Cerny<br/>1993 M. L. West<br/>1998 R. J. Dumbrill</p><p>The latest account, Dumbrill&apos;s _The Musicology and Organology<br/>of the Ancient Near East_ (Green Press, London, 1998) is by far<br/>the most in-depth examination of the entire subject, at almost<br/>700 pages.  He provides generous samples of the book on his site:</p><p><a href="http://members.aol.com/ricdum/mane.htm">http://members.aol.com/ricdum/mane.htm</a></p><p>Unfortunately, since it&apos;s $140, I don&apos;t think I&apos;ll be able to<br/>read the rest of the book until I can find it in a library, and<br/>again unfortunately, even tho I&apos;ve been searching far and wide,<br/>I haven&apos;t yet found it anywhere.</p><p>I found Dumbrill&apos;s reconstruction to be the most musical of them<br/>all so far, and based my original idea on his.  Then I became<br/>convinced, along with some of the scholars trashed by Dumbrill,<br/>that the Babylonian tablet CBS 10996 was really defining *harmonic*<br/>and not melodic intervals.  So I made 2 other reconstructions,<br/>based on 2 different basic scales.  The one in the link below<br/>is the latest.</p><p>&gt; [Troubledoor]<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; The find was especially interesting because it overturned<br/>&gt; conventional views of ancient music, showing that the diatonic<br/>&gt; (7-note) scale and musical harmony were in use more than a<br/>&gt; thousand years earlier than was thought.</p><p>In fact, there&apos;s no doubt at all in my mind that the 12-tone<br/>so-called &apos;Pythagorean&apos; scale was invented by the Sumerians<br/>*at least* 1400 years before Pythagoras lived!  There exists<br/>substantial proof for this: the earliest Babylonian musical<br/>tablet which we&apos;ve found surviving so far  (CBS 10996) provides<br/>a clear recognition of the complete &apos;cylce of 5ths&apos; and 12<br/>different modes or tunings could be achieved by raising or<br/>lowering the tritone, and thus shifting the position of<br/>the tritone in the new scale.  King Shulgi of Ur may have<br/>been the first person to have recorded this scale; he boasts<br/>of having discovered what seems to be this tuning method.</p><p>And as I stated above, I also agree that notes were played<br/>simultaneously to produce harmony.</p><p>The Sumerians may have even figured out how to tune *12-tET*<br/>as long ago as c. 2500-2000 BC!  But I still have much more<br/>research to do before being able to present a good case for this.</p><p>There is absolute proof that they knew how to arrive at<br/>arbitrarily close approximations of the square-root of 2<br/>(tablet YBC 7289), which could have been of use in calculating<br/>12-tET.</p><p>And there is also proof that they limited their cycle of<br/>modes to 12.  This may be a clue that the scale was tempered,<br/>because assuming Pythagorean tuning, the 12th raising or lowering<br/>of the tritone would give a scale identical to the starting one,<br/>except that it would be a semitone higher or lower (respectively)<br/>than the original.  Tempering the scale would remove that<br/>problem.  The CBS 10996 tablet also seems to give a tuning<br/>procedure which provides a way of checking intervals in more<br/>than one way, perhaps to assist in tempering by ear.</p><p>Ernest McClain (first in _The Myth of Invariance_, and in more<br/>depth in _The Pythagorean Plato_) makes a case for the Greeks<br/>having calculated 12-tET, and of course I think it can be shown<br/>that, just as the Babylonians took over the Sumerian culture<br/>as their own, much of the Greek music-theory, science, math,<br/>mythology, etc., was taken from the Babylonians and thus goes<br/>back to Sumerian roots.</p><p>I&apos;ve been doing a lot of research into the Bible too, and can<br/>see that a lot of ancient Hebrew writings are also based on<br/>Sumerian originals.  I have a *lot* more to say about this,<br/>but it&apos;s off-topic...  But anyway, Dr. Ewald Metzler, who<br/>purports to have reconstructed the original tablets of the<br/>10 Commandments, also sees evidence of ancient Hebrew music-<br/>theory in its dimensions:</p><p><a href="http://www.geocities.com/CapitolHill/Senate/7353/dr_ed09e.htm">http://www.geocities.com/CapitolHill/Senate/7353/dr_ed09e.htm</a></p><p>And see the footnote to this message I posted here, concerning<br/>the possibility of Sumerian 12-tET:</p><p><a href="http://www.egroups.com/message/tuning/11107">http://www.egroups.com/message/tuning/11107</a></p><p>As for this Hurrian hymn being the oldest existing musical score,<br/>I don&apos;t think it is.  The CBS 10996 tablet is older, and I believe<br/>that *it* is the oldest score.  More on that below...</p><p>I need some help from someone out there to finish this project:<br/>is there any way to transform a Finale .MUS file into a regular<br/>graphic (.gif, .jpg, etc.)?  If not, since I don&apos;t have a scanner,<br/>could someone who has Finale and a scanner print out my .MUS files<br/>and create graphics from the hard-copy and send them to me?  Thanks!</p><p>I will have *much*, much more to come on this during the rest of<br/>this year.  The post on which I was working follows below:</p><p>------- post drafted a month ago, never submitted: ------</p><p>Hey folks, big news (to me, at least):</p><p>In my quest to unravel the history of tuning and music-theory,<br/>I&apos;m convinced that I&apos;ve correctly deciphered the fundamental<br/>basics of Sumerian music-theory, and thus have traced my<br/>history back to its ultimate beginning.</p><p>Because the Sumerians were the first culture to invent<br/>writing itself (c. 3200 BC), we will not find a written<br/>music-theory older than this.</p><p>The oldest evidence is actually preserved on tablets inscribed<br/>during the &apos;Old Babylonian&apos; period (roughly 2000-1600 BC),<br/>just after Sumerian died out as a spoken language and the<br/>inhabitants of Mesopotamia became exclusively Semitic-speaking<br/>(Akkadian).  But these Babylonians preserved intact for<br/>over 1500 years just about everything in Sumerian culture,<br/>including their music-theory and the written Sumerian language<br/>(and religion, and science, and math, and architecture,<br/>etc., etc...).</p><p>Because of this decipherment, I&apos;ve also reconstructed H6,<br/>the only surviving more-or-less complete Hurrian hymn<br/>(excavated at Ras-as-Shamra, Syria), which has so far<br/>been thought to be the oldest musical score yet found<br/>(c. 1400-1200 BC).  I believe my reconstruction to be<br/>more correct than any of the 9 or so others that have been<br/>made.  Here&apos;s a MIDI file of it:</p><p><a href="http://www.ixpres.com/interval/monzo/babylonian/monzh6.mid">http://www.ixpres.com/interval/monzo/babylonian/monzh6.mid</a></p><p>And my Finale score file of it (I use Finale 97b):</p><p><a href="http://www.ixpres.com/interval/monzo/babylonian/monzh6.mus">http://www.ixpres.com/interval/monzo/babylonian/monzh6.mus</a></p><p>And I qualified the status of this text with &apos;so far&apos;<br/>because I also believe that the notorious Old Babylonian<br/>tablet describing the intervals on the lyre (CBS 10996,<br/>a collection of math problems for use in schools, now<br/>in the University Museum in Philadelphia) is not just<br/>a &apos;text&apos; for studying, but is actually a score to a<br/>sort of etude, for learning the primary intervals of<br/>&apos;5ths/4ths&apos; and &apos;3rds/6ths&apos; as they progress around<br/>the &apos;circle of 5ths&apos;, and as the whole series progresses<br/>thru the series of modal retunings - a sort of &apos;Hanon<br/>exercise&apos; for a budding young Sumerian lyrist:</p><p><a href="http://www.ixpres.com/interval/monzo/babylonian/cbs10996.mid">http://www.ixpres.com/interval/monzo/babylonian/cbs10996.mid</a></p><p>This tablet dates from before 1600 BC, making *it* the<br/>oldest musical score in existence.  Admittedly not a<br/>very interesting &apos;piece&apos; (whereas the Hurrian hymn in<br/>my reconstruction sounds - to me - emotionally powerful),<br/>but still not bad.</p><p>(How ironic that I&apos;ve lived in Philadelphia all these years,<br/>and in fact spent a great deal of last year right on the<br/>Penn campus where this tablet lives, without ever having<br/>taken a look, and am now searching far and wide in California<br/>for any copy of it I can find in any book, without success!...)</p><p>I won&apos;t say anything more technical right now, as I have<br/>yet to write the paper putting all of this together.<br/>There&apos;s already been a vast literature on this subject,<br/>(since the first article in 1960), and I think it&apos;s important<br/>to trace the history of the interpretation of these tablets<br/>before I present my own work on them.</p><p>Right away while working on the Hurrian hymn, I got the idea<br/>of having it performed on one of Johnny Reinhard&apos;s AFMM<br/>concerts.  And since (AFAIK) the Hurrian language hasn&apos;t<br/>been decoded yet, I thought of Sasha Bogdanowitsch doing<br/>the vocal part.  How &apos;bout it, guys?....</p><p>-monz</p><p>Joseph L.
