Most of Neidhardt and Sorge tend to make D(A) about<br/>equal to Bb(Eb). In this respect the 1/7 comma one is already OK.</p><p>There is an exception in the case of Sorge&apos;s tunings intended &apos;for<br/>Chorton organ&apos;. These are flat-centered - the secret here being that<br/>Chorton was a tone higher than the pitch of (most) chamber-music<br/>instruments. Therefore the organ has to transpose, playing in a key a<br/>tone flatter than the rest of the ensemble (C major for the other<br/>instruments is Bb major for the organ).</p><p>&gt; This new graphic trims out what I thought were the weaker<br/>&gt; of my 1/5- and 1/6-comma scales, adds my 1/7-comma scale,<br/>&gt; a George Secor scale, and a Johnson-Secor scale:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; <a href="http://lumma.org/stuff/squarederror2.gif">http://lumma.org/stuff/squarederror2.gif</a><br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; But lo, looking at these, I never would have guessed<br/>&gt; that the sum of the squared error is actually:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;  Johnson-Secor RWT 2578<br/>&gt;  Lumma 1/5 2438<br/>&gt;  Lumma 1/6 2608<br/>&gt;  Lumma 1/7 2432<br/>&gt;  Secor VRWT 2604</p><p>Sum of squared errors automatically favours the tuning which is<br/>nearest ET, since it&apos;s equal to the sum of squared deviations from ET<br/>plus a constant.</p><p>Apparently paradoxically, the tuning with fifths deviating most from<br/>ET has thirds that deviate least. But that is easily explained given<br/>that the &apos;best&apos; third results from only 3 tempered fifths, and the<br/>&apos;worst&apos; has 1.</p><p>~~~T~~~</p></div><h3><a id=69891 href="#69891">ðŸ”—</a>Carl Lumma &#x3C;clumma@yahoo.com&#x3E;</h3><span>2/19/2007 3:43:28 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;Tom Dent&quot; &lt;stringph@...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; --- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;Carl Lumma&quot; &lt;clumma@&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; I wrote...<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; This shows the squared error of the major thirds<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; around the circle of 5ths in my temperaments...<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; <a href="http://lumma.org/stuff/squarederror.gif">http://lumma.org/stuff/squarederror.gif</a><br/>&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; The bottom end of the best keys in each scale is<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; currently on F.
