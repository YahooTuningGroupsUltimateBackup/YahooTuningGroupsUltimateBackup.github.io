I&apos;ve<br/>&gt;just added some Mozart (Sonata number 2 in F, K.280, sequenced by F<br/>&gt;Raborn), and this time, for those whose ears are up to it (or &quot;down&quot; to<br/>&gt;it, since the tuning is flatter!), I&apos;ve included a 7-limit version, also<br/>&gt;grounded to COFT.  The usual 5-limit versions are also present, and no<br/>&gt;doubt would be considered by many on this list to be more appropriate<br/>&gt;for the piece!</p><p>&gt;   <a href="http://www.idcomm.com/personal/jadl/">http://www.idcomm.com/personal/jadl/</a></p><p>&gt;File: <a href="http://wamk280.zip">wamk280.zip</a>.</p><p>I really liked wamk280cs5, even the dynamics (except at around 18:50 and<br/>20:15, where it sounds like there are some volume swells)! At around 5:03,<br/>it sounds like a sharp is too sharp, perhaps replaced by the next higher<br/>note&apos;s flat -- so perhaps a COFT of more than 12 notes would be appropriate,<br/>though not necessarily more historically accurate-sounding.</p><p>By the way, your website says, &quot;Project Retune: the retuning of single-voice<br/>MIDI files to adaptive Just Intonation (JI).&quot; while in fact you&apos;ve done very<br/>little in true adaptive JI and most of your work could be regarded as<br/>adaptive tuning, or perhaps adaptive quasi-JI. And aren&apos;t these multi-voice<br/>MIDI files? They do contain harmony, after all.</p></div>
