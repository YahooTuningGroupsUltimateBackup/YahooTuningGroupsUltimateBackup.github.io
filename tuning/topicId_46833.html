But is also important to see how other abstract shapes can be<br/>formed using the EDOs themselves, and how these are quantizing other ratio<br/>relationships than the 5/4 6/5 of traditional diatony.</p><p>I feel that EDOs and ratios are related through diatonic scales, each<br/>giving a new perspective on the other. In some EDOs, certain relationships<br/>are telescoped (such as #=b), whilst others are retained. Meantone scales<br/>lie halfway between them, being both infinite and constrained at the same<br/>time.</p><p>EDOs may only /represent/ diatonic  or &apos;pentatonic&apos; scales, but sometimes<br/>the representation itself can be an interesting musical object.</p><p>&gt;sounds very much like my aim (and work)! one of my basic<br/>&gt;philosophical differences with you (i think) and with the academic<br/>&gt;community, is that i feel that diatony and pentatony are in no way<br/>&gt;connected with the equal tempered scale of 12 notes in the first<br/>&gt;place. but i hope we&apos;ll keep communicating as much as possible . . .</p></div>
