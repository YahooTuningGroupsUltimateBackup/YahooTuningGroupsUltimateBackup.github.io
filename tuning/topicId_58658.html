You are attributing meanings to a word<br/>that was never intended to contain them.  The term &quot;scale&quot; is only<br/>relevant in the framework of a composition, not in an abstract<br/>mathematical sense.  In terms of composition, a &quot;scale&quot; is a ladder<br/>that ascends to/from and descends from/to a tonic note.  A ladder is<br/>not a ramp--it has a specified number of steps which are specified<br/>distances from one another.  In a certain sense, they are ordered, in<br/>that each step has a specific distance from (and thus cardinal<br/>relation to) the tonic.  You can use a visual metaphor by imagining<br/>an *actual* ladder: it is obvious which step is the first step, the<br/>second, the third, etc.</p><p>Musical compositions traditionally start from the ground, climb<br/>around the ladder for a while, and then get back to the ground.<br/>Where I believe the dissent over &quot;ordering&quot; is arising is in the<br/>presentation of a scale.  When people see a list of notes (say C D E<br/>F G A B C, to keep it simple), some see a definite ordered sequence<br/>and others see a consequence of language.  It is impossible to<br/>represent the particular tones of a scale non-sequentially in a<br/>language, even though they can be *conceptualized* non-sequentially.<br/>I would like to argue here that tones in a scale are ordered but not<br/>sequenced.  The order is purely a result of the cardinality of the<br/>step in respect to its distance from the tonic.  This ordering is<br/>atemporal, and has nothing necessarily to do with the use of a scale<br/>in a composition.  Basically you can jump or drop to and from any<br/>step of the ladder you please, in any sequence you like, but the<br/>ladder is still ordered in the same way.</p><p>This is why the atonalists use the term &quot;tone row&quot; instead<br/>of &quot;scale&quot;; for them, the sequence was important and (theoretically)<br/>the order was non-existant, because there was no tonic.</p><p>I think many of you here are trying to analyze scales as particular<br/>subsets of the pitch continuum, abstract from any compositional<br/>sense.  This is fine (if a little impractical for answer to what<br/>Aline probably thought was a simple question), but you must realize<br/>your use of the word &quot;scale&quot; is misleading at this point.  &quot;Scale&quot;<br/>serves western common practice music fine, but beyond that it is<br/>useful only as an analogue.

This root is relevant.</p><p>Okay does seem we are stretching it quite a bit. It&apos;s<br/>useful to know the origin, thanks! The word<br/>has no particular association with ladders in English if one doesn&apos;t know the roots. One thinks perhaps of scales as in<br/>a device for weighing things. Does it have that association in<br/>Italian too? Or scales of a fish. However, I think the stretching is inevitable if you start<br/>to think about scales geometrically. For instance,<br/>the Hexany or any of those musical geometry type<br/>scales - you can put all the notes into a single<br/>ladder, but the ladder obscures the structure<br/>of the scale. Going up / down the ladder one step<br/>at a time is no longer a particularly useful way<br/>to navigate the scale though of course you<br/>can do it. Similarly also in the infinite Lambdoma,<br/>it no longer is appropriate to go to the &quot;next pitch&quot; higher - because there  is<br/>no next pitch in fact, not in order<br/>of pitch height - and the appropriate<br/>thing to do is to go to the next pitch<br/>in the same row of the Lambdoma - or<br/>alternatively and equally good, to the<br/>next pitch in the same column - which<br/>follows the harmonic or subharmonic<br/>series, which makes a lot of musical<br/>sense. So now you have two directions for your ladders rather than just one.</p><p>In three dimensional scales, in effect<br/>you have three ladders in three directions.<br/>Each step of the horizontal ladder has<br/>a ladder leading up from it vertically<br/>and each of those has a ladder leading from<br/>it in another horizontal direction - then<br/>you may have yet another ladder leading into<br/>the fourth dimension and higher dimensions.</p><p>Perhaps if one wants to coin a word<br/>we could call these things<br/>&quot;multi-scales&quot; or &quot;multi-dimensional<br/>scales&quot;, to mean that they are still<br/>ordered, but not linearly ordered,<br/>they don&apos;t have a one dimenstional order -<br/>they have a two dimensional or higher<br/>order on them. Usually I expect scales will<br/>have some sort of natural order on them.<br/>Though it doesn&apos;t have to coincide<br/>with ordering in ascending pitch.</p><p>So the idea of abstracting away from<br/>the order altogether is that then<br/>you can allow scales with any<br/>type of ordering the scales composer<br/>desired, or none at all, it might<br/>be useful to present a scale sometimes<br/>as just a random juxtaposition of pitches<br/>in no particular order at all to<br/>kind of get one to approach it in a fresh fashion.</p><p>Hope this helps. I&apos;m just presenting<br/>this as a mathematical idea and<br/>often mathematical ideas can<br/>help to clear up or suggest other<br/>ways of looking at things. But<br/>they have no final authority,<br/>there are nearly always many ways<br/>of approaching a particular subject<br/>mathemtaically, different ways of<br/>axiomatising it though that gets obscured<br/>because over time each area of the subject<br/>tends to fall into a particular mode of<br/>treatment that everyone uses by habit<br/>and so they no longer see how much variety<br/>is possible just in the basic ways<br/>of looking at it (not new results, just<br/>different ways of presenting the same<br/>results and concepts). Sometimes though when it comes to applying the<br/>ideas it can be useful to look at<br/>other axiomatisations, for fun if nothing<br/>else. So hopefully my idea will be<br/>useful in that way.

My<br/>Collins Encyclopedia of Music does distinguish them, although I&apos;ll<br/>still provide my own summary definitions:</p><p>1) A list of notes played in order as practice for an instrumentalist</p><p>2) A list of notes written out and enumerated</p><p>3) A set of notes</p><p>Meaning (1) is probably the most common in the real world, and the<br/>least important one here.  It should be obvious how to generalize it<br/>to microtonality, right?</p><p>Meaning (2) is purely theoretical.  At least one reference made this<br/>explicit.  The scale is the thing you write down, not something that<br/>occurs in music.  It certainly has an order, but I&apos;m not sure what<br/>that order means.  At the least, it&apos;s so that you can refer to a<br/>particular note as &quot;the fifth of the scale&quot; and so on.  In this sense,<br/>the order has nothing to do with actual music, except in that it<br/>distinguishes a step from a leap, and groups together intervals as<br/>&quot;thirds&quot;, &quot;fourths&quot;, etc.</p><p>Meaning (3) is the controversial one, and some definitions do leave it<br/>out.  I&apos;ve found at least one reference to suggest that it exists in<br/>the real world.  It&apos;s a subtle thing where you have a finite number of<br/>notes, as it would never do any harm to write them out in order to<br/>give a scale as per definition (2).  Hence it&apos;s only when we start<br/>playing with a potentially infinite set that we have definitional<br/>problems.  I suggest that &quot;the chromatic scale&quot; often uses this<br/>meaning.  You can certainly say that such things should be called<br/>&quot;gamuts&quot; but many people don&apos;t do this.</p><p>&gt; What many of you are discussing here, in my opinion, warrants the<br/>&gt; invention of some new terms.  You are attributing meanings to a word<br/>&gt; that was never intended to contain them.  The term &quot;scale&quot; is only<br/>&gt; relevant in the framework of a composition, not in an abstract<br/>&gt; mathematical sense.  In terms of composition, a &quot;scale&quot; is a ladder<br/>&gt; that ascends to/from and descends from/to a tonic note.  A ladder is<br/>&gt; not a ramp--it has a specified number of steps which are specified<br/>&gt; distances from one another.  In a certain sense, they are ordered, in<br/>&gt; that each step has a specific distance from (and thus cardinal<br/>&gt; relation to) the tonic.  You can use a visual metaphor by imagining<br/>&gt; an *actual* ladder: it is obvious which step is the first step, the<br/>&gt; second, the third, etc.</p><p>I disagree with the relation to composition.  Meaning (1) above<br/>certainly has nothing to do with it.</p><p>Apart from that, I&apos;m happy with this as meaning (2) except for the<br/>word &quot;tonic&quot;.  A tonic is a feature of a key, not a scale.</p><p>&gt; Musical compositions traditionally start from the ground, climb<br/>&gt; around the ladder for a while, and then get back to the ground.<br/>&gt; Where I believe the dissent over &quot;ordering&quot; is arising is in the<br/>&gt; presentation of a scale.  When people see a list of notes (say C D E<br/>&gt; F G A B C, to keep it simple), some see a definite ordered sequence<br/>&gt; and others see a consequence of language.  It is impossible to<br/>&gt; represent the particular tones of a scale non-sequentially in a<br/>&gt; language, even though they can be *conceptualized* non-sequentially.<br/>&gt; I would like to argue here that tones in a scale are ordered but not<br/>&gt; sequenced.  The order is purely a result of the cardinality of the<br/>&gt; step in respect to its distance from the tonic.  This ordering is<br/>&gt; atemporal, and has nothing necessarily to do with the use of a scale<br/>&gt; in a composition.  Basically you can jump or drop to and from any<br/>&gt; step of the ladder you please, in any sequence you like, but the<br/>&gt; ladder is still ordered in the same way.</p><p>No to the first assertion.  Initials and finals are features of modes<br/>or keys, not scales, and needn&apos;t be the same or the lowest (or<br/>highest) note in the scale.</p><p>Yes to order but not sequence, for meaning (2).  That is, order but<br/>not with respect to time.</p><p>Definitions are fairly consistent in giving scales an ordering but not<br/>modes, so there&apos;s more than a conceptual difficulty.  Modes have a<br/>different ordering (initials, finals, and so on) and this should not<br/>be confused with the ordering of a scale.</p><p>&gt; This is why the atonalists use the term &quot;tone row&quot; instead<br/>&gt; of &quot;scale&quot;; for them, the sequence was important and (theoretically)<br/>&gt; the order was non-existant, because there was no tonic.</p><p>Maybe, but you still hear of &quot;the chromatic scale&quot; for atonal music.<br/>Certainly a tone row has a sequence in a way a scale doesn&apos;t.  Whole<br/>tone scales are often used to avoid a sense of key center, but they&apos;re<br/>still called &quot;whole tone scales&quot;.</p><p>&gt; I think many of you here are trying to analyze scales as particular<br/>&gt; subsets of the pitch continuum, abstract from any compositional<br/>&gt; sense.

The &quot;gamut&quot; as the full set of<br/>notes available to the composer is compositionally relevant, and<br/>sounds like useful concept.  The difference between &quot;gamut&quot; and<br/>&quot;scale&quot; could be that it has to be possible to give a single number to<br/>an arbitrary note in a scale.  I&apos;m not sure if this should allow an<br/>octave-equivalent meantone to be a scale enumerated by the spiral of<br/>fifths.  Really it shouldn&apos;t, but disallowing it by definition without<br/>losing a desirable feature will be difficult.</p><p>I disagree with tying the word to common practice as well.  Many of us<br/>are influenced by medieval, renaissance, jazz, and other musics.  The<br/>word &quot;scale&quot; is used fairly liberally, and it would be plain eccentric<br/>to avoid it where a common thread can be found.</p><p>Now, the specific difficulty with common practice music relates to<br/>minor keys.  If a minor key had two different scales, one ascending<br/>and one descending (whatever that means) I&apos;d be happy.  But my<br/>encyclopedia, at least, shows it as having a single scale.  If that<br/>only refers to meaning (1), no problem.  If not, then I&apos;m afraid we<br/>need to fork meaning (2).  One meaning would give us &quot;the seventh<br/>degree of the ascending minor scale&quot; and the other would be ...<br/>whatever that super-scale is supposed to refer to.  I&apos;d be happy to<br/>call that second meaning a peculiarity of common practice music and<br/>leave it out of the general definition.</p><p>And what would &quot;the second degree of the descending minor scale&quot; be?</p><p>                           Graham</p></div><h3><a id=58674 href="#58674">ðŸ”—</a>klaus schmirler &#x3C;KSchmir@online.de&#x3E;</h3><span>5/23/2005 8:27:45 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Graham Breed wrote:</p><p>&gt;I can offer a fresh insight on this because, as of a few days ago, I<br/>&gt;had no idea what a &quot;scale&quot; was, and so have no relevant preconceptions<br/>&gt;;-)  Feel free to disagree with anything I say, but try to back it up.<br/>&gt;  &gt;</p><p>I&apos;ll do my best.

When you play &quot;Dorian&quot; on a chord of the second degree, you just think of the scale of the mode differently, but you are still playing the major mode.

A definite place for a tonic (which is what&apos;s relevant here) is a feature of a mode, which is a scale along with its instructions for use.</p><p>&gt;<br/>&gt;Definitions are fairly consistent in giving scales an ordering but not<br/>&gt;modes, so there&apos;s more than a conceptual difficulty.  Modes have a<br/>&gt;different ordering (initials, finals, and so on) and this should not<br/>&gt;be confused with the ordering of a scale.<br/>&gt;  &gt;</p><p>I would still call these modes scales. You may want to define a middle abstraction of a scale between gamuts and modes. It would still need a starting point and a direction, but have nothing else. However, I wonder what purpose such a soft definition could serve that leaves out all the cultural/stylistic infiormation about pitch ordering (but see below about the minor mode). The order of notes need not be any different than a scale, but the notes would be named for their function. (Ordering by initials and finals results in sample melodies, no?)</p><p>&gt;<br/>&gt;I disagree with tying the word to common practice as well. &gt;<br/>... where functions of chords are more important than functions of tones. That is, I&apos;m totally d&apos;accord.</p><p>&gt;<br/>&gt;Now, the specific difficulty with common practice music relates to<br/>&gt;minor keys.<br/>&gt;</p><p>Better terminology in my opinion: major and minor are modes.</p><p>&gt;  If a minor key had two different scales, one ascending<br/>&gt;and one descending (whatever that means) I&apos;d be happy.<br/>&gt;</p><p>The melodic minor mode has two different scales. Still happy?</p><p>Melodic minor has a gamut of 9 tones, which in scalar order may look just the same as the mode of melodic minor. But as a mode you&apos;d have the additional information that in music you skip notes in the upper tetrachord depending on your direction. When you practice, you extract two 7 note scales, but that&apos;s practice. I guess in theory scale is not a particularly useful concept.</p></div><h3><a id=58678 href="#58678">ðŸ”—</a>Igliashon Jones &#x3C;igliashon@sbcglobal.net&#x3E;</h3><span>5/23/2005 12:21:18 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>&gt; Apart from that, I&apos;m happy with this as meaning (2) except for the<br/>&gt; word &quot;tonic&quot;.

This root is relevant.</p><p>  <a href="http://Dictionary.com">Dictionary.com</a> gives the &quot;traditional&quot; or &quot;common practice&quot;<br/>  definition of scale: &quot;An ascending or descending collection of<br/>  pitches proceeding by a specified scheme of intervals.&quot;</p><p>  What many of you are discussing here, in my opinion, warrants the<br/>  invention of some new terms.  You are attributing meanings to a word<br/>  that was never intended to contain them.  The term &quot;scale&quot; is only<br/>  relevant in the framework of a composition, not in an abstract<br/>  mathematical sense.  In terms of composition, a &quot;scale&quot; is a ladder<br/>  that ascends to/from and descends from/to a tonic note.  A ladder is<br/>  not a ramp--it has a specified number of steps which are specified<br/>  distances from one another.  In a certain sense, they are ordered, in<br/>  that each step has a specific distance from (and thus cardinal<br/>  relation to) the tonic.  You can use a visual metaphor by imagining<br/>  an *actual* ladder: it is obvious which step is the first step, the<br/>  second, the third, etc.</p><p>  Musical compositions traditionally start from the ground, climb<br/>  around the ladder for a while, and then get back to the ground.<br/>  Where I believe the dissent over &quot;ordering&quot; is arising is in the<br/>  presentation of a scale.  When people see a list of notes (say C D E<br/>  F G A B C, to keep it simple), some see a definite ordered sequence<br/>  and others see a consequence of language.  It is impossible to<br/>  represent the particular tones of a scale non-sequentially in a<br/>  language, even though they can be *conceptualized* non-sequentially.<br/>  I would like to argue here that tones in a scale are ordered but not<br/>  sequenced.  The order is purely a result of the cardinality of the<br/>  step in respect to its distance from the tonic.  This ordering is<br/>  atemporal, and has nothing necessarily to do with the use of a scale<br/>  in a composition.  Basically you can jump or drop to and from any<br/>  step of the ladder you please, in any sequence you like, but the<br/>  ladder is still ordered in the same way.</p><p>  This is why the atonalists use the term &quot;tone row&quot; instead<br/>  of &quot;scale&quot;; for them, the sequence was important and (theoretically)<br/>  the order was non-existant, because there was no tonic.</p><p>  I think many of you here are trying to analyze scales as particular<br/>  subsets of the pitch continuum, abstract from any compositional<br/>  sense.  This is fine (if a little impractical for answer to what<br/>  Aline probably thought was a simple question), but you must realize<br/>  your use of the word &quot;scale&quot; is misleading at this point.  &quot;Scale&quot;<br/>  serves western common practice music fine, but beyond that it is<br/>  useful only as an analogue.  Don&apos;t stretch it beyond its common<br/>  practice use; find a new term that will better serve your purposes!<br/>  Mr. Walker&apos;s proposed mathematical definition is much more<br/>  appropriate for the word &quot;gamut&quot; than for &quot;scale&quot;, IMHO.</p><p>  Regards to all,</p><p>  -Igs</p></div><h3><a id=58717 href="#58717">ðŸ”—</a>Ozan Yarman &#x3C;ozanyarman@superonline.com&#x3E;</h3><span>5/24/2005 5:55:21 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Dear Robert, why don&apos;t you use the term &grave;lattice&grave; instead of &grave;scale&grave; to<br/>define a sound system which deviate from an ordered sequence of notes?</p><p>Cordially,<br/>Ozan</p><p>----- Original Message -----<br/>From: &quot;Robert Walker&quot; &lt;<a href="mailto:robertwalker@ntlworld.com">robertwalker@ntlworld.com</a>&gt;<br/>To: &lt;<a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>&gt;<br/>Sent: 23 May&iuml;&iquest;&half;s 2005 Pazartesi 6:09<br/>Subject: [tuning] Re: Scales: an lengthy attempt at proper definition</p><p>&gt; Hi there,<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; The term &quot;Scala&quot; in Italian languaje means &quot;staircase&quot; or &quot;ladder&quot;.<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; The Spanish word &quot;Escalera&quot; has the same meaning.<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; I believe the term has a Latin origin.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; It does: scalae, which means ladder. This root is relevant.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Okay does seem we are stretching it quite a bit. It&apos;s<br/>&gt; useful to know the origin, thanks! The word<br/>&gt; has no particular association with ladders in English if<br/>&gt; one doesn&apos;t know the roots. One thinks perhaps of scales as in<br/>&gt; a device for weighing things. Does it have that association in<br/>&gt; Italian too? Or scales of a fish.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; However, I think the stretching is inevitable if you start<br/>&gt; to think about scales geometrically. For instance,<br/>&gt; the Hexany or any of those musical geometry type<br/>&gt; scales - you can put all the notes into a single<br/>&gt; ladder, but the ladder obscures the structure<br/>&gt; of the scale. Going up / down the ladder one step<br/>&gt; at a time is no longer a particularly useful way<br/>&gt; to navigate the scale though of course you<br/>&gt; can do it.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Similarly also in the infinite Lambdoma,<br/>&gt; it no longer is appropriate to go to the<br/>&gt; &quot;next pitch&quot; higher - because there  is<br/>&gt; no next pitch in fact, not in order<br/>&gt; of pitch height - and the appropriate<br/>&gt; thing to do is to go to the next pitch<br/>&gt; in the same row of the Lambdoma - or<br/>&gt; alternatively and equally good, to the<br/>&gt; next pitch in the same column - which<br/>&gt; follows the harmonic or subharmonic<br/>&gt; series, which makes a lot of musical<br/>&gt; sense. So now you have two directions<br/>&gt; for your ladders rather than just one.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; In three dimensional scales, in effect<br/>&gt; you have three ladders in three directions.<br/>&gt; Each step of the horizontal ladder has<br/>&gt; a ladder leading up from it vertically<br/>&gt; and each of those has a ladder leading from<br/>&gt; it in another horizontal direction - then<br/>&gt; you may have yet another ladder leading into<br/>&gt; the fourth dimension and higher dimensions.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Perhaps if one wants to coin a word<br/>&gt; we could call these things<br/>&gt; &quot;multi-scales&quot; or &quot;multi-dimensional<br/>&gt; scales&quot;, to mean that they are still<br/>&gt; ordered, but not linearly ordered,<br/>&gt; they don&apos;t have a one dimenstional order -<br/>&gt; they have a two dimensional or higher<br/>&gt; order on them. Usually I expect scales will<br/>&gt; have some sort of natural order on them.<br/>&gt; Though it doesn&apos;t have to coincide<br/>&gt; with ordering in ascending pitch.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; So the idea of abstracting away from<br/>&gt; the order altogether is that then<br/>&gt; you can allow scales with any<br/>&gt; type of ordering the scales composer<br/>&gt; desired, or none at all, it might<br/>&gt; be useful to present a scale sometimes<br/>&gt; as just a random juxtaposition of pitches<br/>&gt; in no particular order at all to<br/>&gt; kind of get one to approach it in<br/>&gt; a fresh fashion.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Hope this helps. I&apos;m just presenting<br/>&gt; this as a mathematical idea and<br/>&gt; often mathematical ideas can<br/>&gt; help to clear up or suggest other<br/>&gt; ways of looking at things. But<br/>&gt; they have no final authority,<br/>&gt; there are nearly always many ways<br/>&gt; of approaching a particular subject<br/>&gt; mathemtaically, different ways of<br/>&gt; axiomatising it though that gets obscured<br/>&gt; because over time each area of the subject<br/>&gt; tends to fall into a particular mode of<br/>&gt; treatment that everyone uses by habit<br/>&gt; and so they no longer see how much variety<br/>&gt; is possible just in the basic ways<br/>&gt; of looking at it (not new results, just<br/>&gt; different ways of presenting the same<br/>&gt; results and concepts).<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Sometimes though when it comes to applying the<br/>&gt; ideas it can be useful to look at<br/>&gt; other axiomatisations, for fun if nothing<br/>&gt; else.

Here&apos;s Johnny Reinhard&apos;s response<br/>to the thread -<br/>      &quot;a scale is the scaffold from which music is built.&quot;</p><p>While I don&apos;t disagree with that as a starting-point - defining<br/>the _use_ of a scale, it&apos;s not particularly helpful in deciding<br/>whether any given collection of pitches, pitch-classes,<br/>directions, orders, rules ... whatever! is or is not a scale.  More<br/>to the point, it doesn&apos;t help us construct scales, or point out<br/>features of our constructions which might make them more<br/>or less useful in making music in various ways.  On the other<br/>hand, the kinds of concepts and measures canvassed in this<br/>discussion - convexity, propriety and so on - and reported in<br/>bewildering profusion by Scala, do help us by pointing out<br/>many such features - if only we can get a grasp on which of<br/>those features _we_ want.  In case it&apos;s not obvious, I&apos;ve<br/>still got a long way to go before I&apos;ll be confident I<br/>understand what most people on this list are talking about,<br/>(what IS a CPS, anyway?) but I&apos;ll persevere because I&apos;m<br/>stubborn!  And even those things I thought I understood<br/>the &quot;tuning-list orthodoxy&quot; on, I may have misjudged based<br/>purely on who&apos;s been vocal recently ... For example, I gave<br/>Aline an &quot;easy&quot; answer as to what a JI scale is, and as might<br/>be expected, provoked a reaction from someone else (Dave<br/>Keenan) showing me it wasn&apos;t so easy ... :-)  Still, I thought<br/>Dave&apos;s answer (enabling tuning by ear without beats) was<br/>equally facile, and a good deal harder to verify - How do I<br/>know that two tuners hear the same thing?  (Answer:<br/>I don&apos;t, because there are &quot;good tuners&quot; and &quot;bad tuners&quot;,<br/>who get very different results; so according to Dave&apos;s<br/>definition, one man&apos;s JI scale is another man&apos;s Poison ...)</p><p>Enough grumbling about how hard this all is!  I still believe<br/>that we ought to be able to come up, collectively, with a set<br/>of tuning terms that make musical sense and are also<br/>objectively demonstrable and verifiable - in other words,<br/>belong to a science of musical tuning.  I&apos;m glad you seem<br/>to share this belief, and I do thank you for offering your<br/>own list (below).</p><p>On your usage, I suspect that you and I have opposite<br/>notions of &quot;scale&quot; and &quot;gamut&quot;.  For me, the gamut is the<br/>total set of notes you can play - it covers the whole range<br/>from &quot;gamma&quot; to &quot;ut&quot;.  This usage seems to have historical<br/>precedent too.  The scale is the ascent or descent of pitches<br/>in that gamut; they become steps in a ladder.</p><p>When the notion of octave-equivalence rules, specifying the<br/>scale motion within the octave means automatically that you<br/>have  specified the scale motion throughout the entire gamut.<br/>In this case, a scale is determined by its rising and falling<br/>steps within any one octave of the gamut, and we can<br/>consider a scale class as being the ascent and descent of<br/>pitch-classes within an octave-reduced gamut, as I think<br/>Gene did.</p><p>Tonic:  Yes, thanks for defining this term.  I think we would<br/>also want, for some musical styles, to define dominant,<br/>mediant, initial, final ... because of their specialised r&iuml;&iquest;&half;les<br/>analogous to the specialised r&iuml;&iquest;&half;le of a tonic.  However, I&apos;m<br/>unsure whether by &quot;priority function&quot; you simply mean that<br/>the tonic is counted as &quot;first step&quot; in the scale (ladder), or<br/>do you mean that the tonic is more important than other<br/>pitches?  And if the latter, melodically or harmonically?</p><p>Key/Rag/Maqam:  OK for now.</p><p>Mode:  I take it your definition is the relative one, as in<br/>&quot;the Dorian mode of ...&quot;, or &quot;the Aeolian mode of ...&quot;, say,<br/>C major?  A common way of explaining modes in music<br/>textbooks has been along the following lines -<br/>&quot;Take the white keys of the piano, starting at middle C.<br/>Play an ascending scale of eight white notes until you<br/>reach C above middle C.  This is one mode, and its name<br/>is ....  Now start instead on the D above middle C, and play<br/>an ascending scale of eight white notes until you reach<br/>the D above that.  This is another mode, and its name is<br/>....&quot; (The names vary depending on who you read or listen<br/>to, or how classically Greek their inclinations are; some<br/>prefer the names given by Glareanus.)  Doesn&apos;t sound<br/>like much more than transposing a given scale diatonically<br/>(drawing on the same gamut), does it?</p><p>But in terms of ancient Greek practice, or of mediaeval<br/>church practice, a mode was much more than that, and<br/>the usual relationships we expect between notes of a<br/>Western scale didn&apos;t always apply - for example, the<br/>dominant wasn&apos;t always a fifth above the tonic.  Because<br/>of its rules about use of the notes in its gamut, a mode<br/>was more akin to a raga or a maqam than to a scale.</p><p>Also, as another writer indicated recently on this list,<br/>a &quot;guitar mode&quot; has rather more to do with fingering<br/>than with an abstract selection of pitches.  At least,<br/>that&apos;s what I think they meant, and if I&apos;m wrong,<br/>someone&apos;s bound to correct me :-)</p><p>Surely a transposed scale is still a scale?  To avoid<br/>confusion with received musical usage, I think we need<br/>to accept that the term &quot;mode&quot; has as least the following<br/>four distinct meanings -<br/>1.  A Greek mode - An ancient Greek scale, with rules like a maqam.<br/>2.  An ecclesiastical mode - a mediaeval church scale, with rules<br/>like a maqam.<br/>3.  The mode of the nth degree, or the nth mode, of a given key -<br/>a diatonic transposition of a common-practice scale upwards by<br/>n scale degrees.<br/>4.  A guitar mode - a fingering pattern on the guitar.</p><p>Possibly we could press the ancient Greek terms tonos (plural<br/>tonoi) and tropos (plural tropoi) back into service to avoid using<br/>terms that are now overladen with meaning.  (I say &quot;overladen&quot;,<br/>because it&apos;s bad, like the straw that broke the camel&apos;s back,<br/>rather than &quot;overloaded&quot;, which is regarded as good practice in<br/>object-oriented programming (OOP) circles.  Come to think of it,<br/>perhaps the OOP paradigm could be more fruitful for discussing<br/>musical tuning than abstract algebra has been - it certainly offers<br/>some suggestive terms, including &quot;class&quot; and &quot;method&quot;.  Perhaps<br/>we should start a tuning-OOP list?

The scale is the ascent or descent of pitches<br/>&gt; in that gamut; they become steps in a ladder.</p><p>The beautiful thing about the gamut is that, unlike the &quot;white note<br/>scale&quot;, it provides room for alterations. It is a system of seven note<br/>names (a, b, c, d, e, f, g; doubled an octave higher and capitalized<br/>an octave lower, with a lone Greek Gamma below the A) overlaid with<br/>six &quot;alteration indicators&quot; (ut, re, mi, fa, sol, la: there has to be<br/>a half step between mi and fa). Tones were identified by their name<br/>and up to three &quot;indicators&quot;. The lowest note was gamma ut (so the<br/>name doesn&apos;t indicate any from-to idea), C could be fa or a new ut (so<br/>must have been called C fa ut), F likewise, and G was ut again, but<br/>also the sol in the hexachord on C or the re in the hexachord on F (G<br/>ut sol re). B was B fa mi, a fourth from F or a ditonus from G, so<br/>modern b and b flat were represented as one note. Finding the right<br/>hexachord for a note was the medieval equivalen of accidentals.</p><p>&gt;<br/>&gt; When the notion of octave-equivalence rules, specifying the<br/>&gt; scale motion within the octave means automatically that you<br/>&gt; have  specified the scale motion throughout the entire gamut.</p><p>In the original gamut, it took a little more ...</p><p>&gt; In this case, a scale is determined by its rising and falling<br/>&gt; steps within any one octave of the gamut, and we can<br/>&gt; consider a scale class as being the ascent and descent of<br/>&gt; pitch-classes within an octave-reduced gamut, as I think<br/>&gt; Gene did.</p><p>What about the scales that extend beyond the octave and where not<br/>every note has an unaltered octave?

But many problems will likely arise, not only in semantics, but also in etymology, epistemology, terminology, semiology and whatnot during our bold and daring quest to create a universal scientific ultra-comprehensive non-concise glossary of essential tuning terms and theoretical pharapharnalia!</p><p>  On your usage, I suspect that you and I have opposite<br/>  notions of &quot;scale&quot; and &quot;gamut&quot;.  For me, the gamut is the<br/>  total set of notes you can play - it covers the whole range<br/>  from &quot;gamma&quot; to &quot;ut&quot;.  This usage seems to have historical<br/>  precedent too.  The scale is the ascent or descent of pitches<br/>  in that gamut; they become steps in a ladder.</p><p>But this is not how we are taught! Maybe it matters little now that historical precedents override my arguments, but obviously this is not what I understand when asked to perform a &grave;minor gamme&grave;. I will definitely only choose the natural minor when writing the key signature, but will rarely, if at all, compose in it without alterating to the other minor scales.</p><p>My respected colleague, I can only think of the gamme as a dynamic, fluid, transitory passage of notes traversing the entire height of the 1st melodic minor scale, then falling back through the 2nd melodic minor scale. I cannot, in my right of mind, think of an ascending-descending scale, for that would mean that the ladder, or the each step, is moving!</p><p>If I may be allowed to iterate, I consider the scale to be an assortment of pitches from low to high with a beginning and an end, nothing more. The scale retains no information whatsoever as to which degrees function as tonic, dominant, leading tone, etc... and nothing can be inferred as to which mode or key such an assortment of pitches indicate!</p><p>  When the notion of octave-equivalence rules, specifying the<br/>  scale motion within the octave means automatically that you<br/>  have  specified the scale motion throughout the entire gamut.<br/>  In this case, a scale is determined by its rising and falling<br/>  steps within any one octave of the gamut, and we can<br/>  consider a scale class as being the ascent and descent of<br/>  pitch-classes within an octave-reduced gamut, as I think<br/>  Gene did.</p><p>How can this be? It is the gamut that is ascending-descending the scale(s). The scale is merely the foothold for whatever is moving over it. Or perhaps you are considering an escalator? But then there should be a constant glide of all the 7 notes played simultenously. This is certainly not the gamme that I know of. In simplest terms, the C major gamme is sounding the full extent of the C major scale by sounding each note succesively from low to high, and then high to low.</p><p>  Tonic:  Yes, thanks for defining this term.  I think we would<br/>  also want, for some musical styles, to define dominant,<br/>  mediant, initial, final ... because of their specialised r&ocirc;les<br/>  analogous to the specialised r&ocirc;le of a tonic.  However, I&apos;m<br/>  unsure whether by &quot;priority function&quot; you simply mean that<br/>  the tonic is counted as &quot;first step&quot; in the scale (ladder), or<br/>  do you mean that the tonic is more important than other<br/>  pitches?  And if the latter, melodically or harmonically?</p><p>All of them of course.</p><p>  Key/Rag/Maqam:  OK for now.</p><p>  Mode:  I take it your definition is the relative one, as in<br/>  &quot;the Dorian mode of ...&quot;, or &quot;the Aeolian mode of ...&quot;, say,<br/>  C major?</p><p>How else can one do it? You need first a scale to have a mode! The only scale you will ever need for all the Greek modes is the C major scale, whose successive degrees determine the nature of the mode. The scale itself bears no information as to which mode you desire, save for the faintest inclination that directs you to choosing the first degree by default. Thus, C major scale can be made synonymous with C major mode AKA Ionian, as mostly done, which I find obstructive to proper methodology.</p><p>  A common way of explaining modes in music<br/>  textbooks has been along the following lines -<br/>  &quot;Take the white keys of the piano, starting at middle C.<br/>  Play an ascending scale of eight white notes until you<br/>  reach C above middle C.  This is one mode, and its name<br/>  is ....  Now start instead on the D above middle C, and play<br/>  an ascending scale of eight white notes until you reach<br/>  the D above that.  This is another mode, and its name is<br/>  ....&quot; (The names vary depending on who you read or listen<br/>  to, or how classically Greek their inclinations are; some<br/>  prefer the names given by Glareanus.)  Doesn&apos;t sound<br/>  like much more than transposing a given scale diatonically<br/>  (drawing on the same gamut), does it?</p><p>  But in terms of ancient Greek practice, or of mediaeval<br/>  church practice, a mode was much more than that, and<br/>  the usual relationships we expect between notes of a<br/>  Western scale didn&apos;t always apply - for example, the<br/>  dominant wasn&apos;t always a fifth above the tonic.  Because<br/>  of its rules about use of the notes in its gamut, a mode<br/>  was more akin to a raga or a maqam than to a scale.</p><p>Of course! That is why a mode is so much more than a scale. It contains information as to which degree is the finalis, and which is the co-finalis, and what other functions are ascribed to several others.</p><p>  Also, as another writer indicated recently on this list,<br/>  a &quot;guitar mode&quot; has rather more to do with fingering<br/>  than with an abstract selection of pitches.  At least,<br/>  that&apos;s what I think they meant, and if I&apos;m wrong,<br/>  someone&apos;s bound to correct me :-)</p><p>We digress. Let us regress.</p><p>  Surely a transposed scale is still a scale?</p><p>A transposed scale in reference to a scale superimposed over itself? That would extend the range of the gamut as well as adding new pitches which must be dealt with. A scale is only a list of intervals, if you transpose the globule of pitches within the scale and overlap this over itself, the result is a scale which is bigger and more complicated to begin with.</p><p>I understand that you are referring to transposing the C major mode to another degree of the C major scale, at which point, the resulting mode will be identical in every way with the previous mode, its interval structure will be the same, while the scale itself is now extended. In such a case, and if the passage is fluid/dynamic/transient where certain degrees are given important roles, we are dealing with the Key of C Major, which is surely much more than the C major mode, let alone C major scale!</p><p>  To avoid<br/>  confusion with received musical usage, I think we need<br/>  to accept that the term &quot;mode&quot; has as least the following<br/>  four distinct meanings -<br/>  1.  A Greek mode - An ancient Greek scale, with rules like a maqam.<br/>  2.  An ecclesiastical mode - a mediaeval church scale, with rules<br/>  like a maqam.<br/>  3.  The mode of the nth degree, or the nth mode, of a given key -<br/>  a diatonic transposition of a common-practice scale upwards by<br/>  n scale degrees.<br/>  4.  A guitar mode - a fingering pattern on the guitar.</p><p>I concur with all this information, save for the fact that a maqam is much more than a mode, simply because, like the key of C major, it contains information as to which modulations and transpositions are made available to the composer. For example, one can, with masterful articulation, use the fourth degree of Huzzam as a stepping stone to Nihavend like this:</p><p>Ed F G Ad Bd C Bd Ad G F Ed D/# Ed</p><p>G Ad Bb C Bb Ad G F</p><p>Where the comma-flats are most flexible. I never heard of a mode where one can suddenly enter the sphere of another mode.</p><p>  Possibly we could press the ancient Greek terms tonos (plural<br/>  tonoi) and tropos (plural tropoi) back into service to avoid using<br/>  terms that are now overladen with meaning.  (I say &quot;overladen&quot;,<br/>  because it&apos;s bad, like the straw that broke the camel&apos;s back,<br/>  rather than &quot;overloaded&quot;, which is regarded as good practice in<br/>  object-oriented programming (OOP) circles.  Come to think of it,<br/>  perhaps the OOP paradigm could be more fruitful for discussing<br/>  musical tuning than abstract algebra has been - it certainly offers<br/>  some suggestive terms, including &quot;class&quot; and &quot;method&quot;.  Perhaps<br/>  we should start a tuning-OOP list?  I could hide all my gaffes<br/>  there ...)</p><p>I am most excited about new terms. And, if it will clear the confusion, I will refer to gamut as gamme from this point forth.</p><p>  But do tell me, Ozan, since you avoided the &quot;metric&quot; and &quot;distance&quot;<br/>  terms completely - what are your ideas on that subject?</p><p>  Regards,<br/>  Yahya</p><p>I lack the technical capacity to fill in the details for those.

It is a system of seven note<br/>&gt; names (a, b, c, d, e, f, g; doubled an octave higher and capitalized<br/>&gt; an octave lower, with a lone Greek Gamma below the A) overlaid with<br/>&gt; six &quot;alteration indicators&quot; (ut, re, mi, fa, sol, la: there has to be<br/>&gt; a half step between mi and fa). Tones were identified by their name<br/>&gt; and up to three &quot;indicators&quot;. The lowest note was gamma ut (so the<br/>&gt; name doesn&apos;t indicate any from-to idea), C could be fa or a new ut (so<br/>&gt; must have been called C fa ut), F likewise, and G was ut again, but<br/>&gt; also the sol in the hexachord on C or the re in the hexachord on F (G<br/>&gt; ut sol re). B was B fa mi, a fourth from F or a ditonus from G, so<br/>&gt; modern b and b flat were represented as one note. Finding the right<br/>&gt; hexachord for a note was the medieval equivalen of accidentals.</p><p>[YA]  Sounds very complex ...!  Where can I read more on the<br/>_historical_ usage of gamut you&apos;re drawing on here?  All I have to hand<br/>on the subject is &quot;The Pelican History of Music&quot;, bought decades ago<br/>and probably mostly superseded by now.</p><p>&gt; &gt; When the notion of octave-equivalence rules, specifying the<br/>&gt; &gt; scale motion within the octave means automatically that you<br/>&gt; &gt; have  specified the scale motion throughout the entire gamut.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; In the original gamut, it took a little more ...</p><p>&gt; &gt; In this case, a scale is determined by its rising and falling<br/>&gt; &gt; steps within any one octave of the gamut, and we can<br/>&gt; &gt; consider a scale class as being the ascent and descent of<br/>&gt; &gt; pitch-classes within an octave-reduced gamut, as I think<br/>&gt; &gt; Gene did.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; What about the scales that extend beyond the octave and where not<br/>&gt; every note has an unaltered octave? I should say the gamut, in an<br/>&gt; octave-reduced form, can hold them all, but the scale has to have the<br/>&gt; &quot;different&quot; notes in their proper places.<br/>[YA]  I think your &quot;original gamut&quot; is a structure with special<br/>relationships between pitches over more than an octave, isn&apos;t<br/>it?  In which case, octave reductions is essentially foreign to<br/>its nature.  (As, for example, in a tuning system that contains<br/>only the overtones of a given fundamental pitch C0, the notes<br/>C1 an octave higher, G1 a twelfth higher, C2 two octaves higher,<br/>E2, G2, Bb2, C3, D3, E3 ... belong to the system, but E1, Bb1 and<br/>D1 don&apos;t.)</p><p>&gt; &gt; Also, as another writer indicated recently on this list,<br/>&gt; &gt; a &quot;guitar mode&quot; has rather more to do with fingering<br/>&gt; &gt; than with an abstract selection of pitches.

Church modes<br/>&gt; originally were mostly called &quot;in the nth tone&quot; originally, so why<br/>&gt; not? (I have to admit that I&apos;m not clear on the meaning of tonoi and<br/>&gt; tropoi, though).<br/>[YA]  Good enough for me, but a trifle longwinded perhaps?  Why not<br/>just &quot;the 4th tone&quot; and so on?</p><p>&gt; On the other hand, I think you might just as well replace the Berklee<br/>&gt; modes by referring to the tonality and scale degrees directly.

Here&apos;s Johnny Reinhard&apos;s response<br/>&gt; &gt; to the thread -<br/>&gt; &gt;         &quot;a scale is the scaffold from which music is built.&quot;</p><p>&gt; Most of the definitions I read aren&apos;t sinking in yet.</p><p>[YA]  I find that some definitions &quot;resonate&quot; with my ...<br/>sensibilities, or prejudices?  ... while others leave me floundering.</p><p>&gt; &gt;   While I don&apos;t disagree with that as a starting-point - defining<br/>&gt; &gt;   the _use_ of a scale, it&apos;s not particularly helpful in deciding<br/>&gt; &gt;   whether any given collection of pitches, pitch-classes,<br/>&gt; &gt;   directions, orders, rules ... whatever! is or is not a scale.  More<br/>&gt; &gt;   to the point, it doesn&apos;t help us construct scales, or point out<br/>&gt; &gt;   features of our constructions which might make them more<br/>&gt; &gt;   or less useful in making music in various ways.  On the other<br/>&gt; &gt;   hand, the kinds of concepts and measures canvassed in this<br/>&gt; &gt;   discussion - convexity, propriety and so on - and reported in<br/>&gt; &gt;   bewildering profusion by Scala, do help us by pointing out<br/>&gt; &gt;   many such features - if only we can get a grasp on which of<br/>&gt; &gt;   those features _we_ want.</p><p>&gt; I surmise you will be interested to inquire as to how we pianists<br/>&gt; are educated about scales/modes/keys to begin with.</p><p>[YA]  But of course.  Or more specifically, how the education<br/>of a pianist in a Francophone country differs from that in an<br/>Anglophone country.  You studied in Belgium, didn&apos;t you?  And<br/>I in Australia.</p><p>&gt; &gt;   In case it&apos;s not obvious, I&apos;ve<br/>&gt; &gt;   still got a long way to go before I&apos;ll be confident I<br/>&gt; &gt;   understand what most people on this list are talking about,<br/>&gt; &gt;   (what IS a CPS, anyway?) but I&apos;ll persevere because I&apos;m<br/>&gt; &gt;   stubborn!</p><p>&gt; To say nothing of myself!

For example, I gave<br/>&gt; &gt;   Aline an &quot;easy&quot; answer as to what a JI scale is, and as might<br/>&gt; &gt;   be expected, provoked a reaction from someone else (Dave<br/>&gt; &gt;   Keenan) showing me it wasn&apos;t so easy ... :-)  Still, I thought<br/>&gt; &gt;   Dave&apos;s answer (enabling tuning by ear without beats) was<br/>&gt; &gt;   equally facile, and a good deal harder to verify - How do I<br/>&gt; &gt;   know that two tuners hear the same thing?  (Answer:<br/>&gt; &gt;   I don&apos;t, because there are &quot;good tuners&quot; and &quot;bad tuners&quot;,<br/>&gt; &gt;   who get very different results; so according to Dave&apos;s<br/>&gt; &gt;   definition, one man&apos;s JI scale is another man&apos;s Poison ...)</p><p>&gt; That is a nightmare! A horrific prejudice which I have been fortunate<br/>&gt; enough to abondon only recently. I am finally very careful to remark<br/>&gt; that it is only myself who has a problem with the way things are<br/>&gt; explained, and can have little claims as to my opinion being universal.<br/>&gt; Far from it!

The scale is the ascent or descent of pitches<br/>&gt; &gt;   in that gamut; they become steps in a ladder.</p><p>&gt; But this is not how we are taught! Maybe it matters little now<br/>&gt; that historical precedents override my arguments, but obviously<br/>&gt; this is not what I understand when asked to perform a &grave;minor<br/>&gt; gamme&grave;. I will definitely only choose the natural minor when<br/>&gt; writing the key signature, but will rarely, if at all, compose in it<br/>&gt; without alterating to the other minor scales.</p><p>[YA]  On being asked to perform a &quot;minor scale&quot;, I would of course<br/>oblige the teacher with the notes, rising and falling, of the minor<br/>scale in a fixed compass - whether one octave, or two, or more,<br/>depending on the level of the class.  If the teacher did not specify<br/>the compass (or range), I would usually choose to play the scale over<br/>two octaves as being the minimum that well demonstrates the melodic<br/>flow about every degree of the scale.  I think I&apos;m right in saying that<br/>French offers only &quot;gamme&quot; as a translation of the English &quot;scale&quot; or<br/>Latin &quot;scala&quot;?</p><p>&gt; My respected colleague, I can only think of the gamme as a dynamic,<br/>&gt; fluid, transitory passage of notes traversing the entire height of<br/>&gt; the 1st melodic minor scale, then falling back through the 2nd melodic<br/>&gt; minor scale. I cannot, in my right of mind, think of an ascending-<br/>&gt; descending scale, for that would mean that the ladder, or the each<br/>&gt; step, is moving!</p><p>[YA]  I think we&apos;re talking at cross-purposes here ... As far as I recall,<br/>my definitions did not imply that any scale moved, but that each scale<br/>offered both one pattern for ascent and another for descent - two<br/>ladders, side-by-side, if you will.  Certainly that is what I meant!</p><p>&gt; If I may be allowed to iterate, I consider the scale to be an<br/>&gt; assortment of pitches from low to high ... .</p><p>[YA]  Which I called &quot;gamut&quot;.</p><p>&gt; .. with a beginning and an end,<br/>&gt; nothing more.</p><p>[YA]  This is only halfway to being a scale as I understand it.<br/>Or does your &quot;C melodic minor scale&quot; consist of 9 notes to every<br/>octave, arranged in order of increasing pitch, so that it contains<br/>both a minor sixth degree and a major sixth degree, and likewise<br/>for sevenths?  My &quot;C melodic minor scale&quot; consists of 7 notes to<br/>every octave in one pattern ascending, and of 7 notes to every<br/>octave in another pattern descending, so that it contains<br/>only a major sixth degree when ascending, and only a minor sixth<br/>degree when descending,  and likewise for sevenths.  My scale is<br/>a set of patterns of melodic movement, built on a gamut of 9 notes.</p><p>&gt; The scale retains no information whatsoever as to which degrees<br/>&gt; function as tonic, dominant, leading tone, etc... and nothing can be<br/>&gt; inferred as to which mode or key such an assortment of pitches<br/>&gt; indicate!</p><p>[YA]  I understand that your halfway-scale (= gamut+pitch order)<br/>does not distinguish a tonic starting-point.  Certainly it contains a<br/>lowest note of the gamut, which may have nothing to do with<br/>anything but the pitch limitations of the instrument.  A scale in my<br/>sense also does not require a fixed starting-point; however, _in a<br/>given context of musical practice_, the two patterns of notes<br/>provided by my &quot;C melodic minor scale&quot; only occur in a key called<br/>&quot;C minor&quot;.</p><p>&gt; &gt;   When the notion of octave-equivalence rules, specifying the<br/>&gt; &gt;   scale motion within the octave means automatically that you<br/>&gt; &gt;   have  specified the scale motion throughout the entire gamut.<br/>&gt; &gt;   In this case, a scale is determined by its rising and falling<br/>&gt; &gt;   steps within any one octave of the gamut, and we can<br/>&gt; &gt;   consider a scale class as being the ascent and descent of<br/>&gt; &gt;   pitch-classes within an octave-reduced gamut, as I think<br/>&gt; &gt;   Gene did.</p><p>&gt; How can this be? It is the gamut that is ascending-descending<br/>&gt; the scale(s). The scale is merely the foothold for whatever is<br/>&gt; moving over it.</p><p>[YA]  In music, what moves?  Melody, rhythm, harmony.  A melody<br/>in C minor moves over the notes of the C (melodic) minor scale.<br/>A complex harmony in C minor moves over the notes of the<br/>C (harmonic) minor scale.  I don&apos;t think the gamut - the collection<br/>of notes - moves at all.  What you consider as moving is the &quot;gamme&quot;<br/>- a melody consisting of many or all notes of a particular (say<br/>C minor) scale.  With enough fingers - or a long stick, I could play<br/>all the notes of the C major gamut on the piano simultaneously.</p><p>&gt; Or perhaps you are considering an escalator? But then there<br/>&gt; should be a constant glide of all the 7 notes played simultenously.<br/>&gt; This is certainly not the gamme that I know of.  In simplest terms,<br/>&gt; the C major gamme is sounding the full extent of the C major scale<br/>&gt; by sounding each note succesively from low to high, and then high<br/>&gt; to low.</p><p>[YA] In my terms, that is a melody, not a scale.</p><p>&gt; &gt;   Tonic:  Yes, thanks for defining this term.  I think we would<br/>&gt; &gt;   also want, for some musical styles, to define dominant,<br/>&gt; &gt;   mediant, initial, final ... because of their specialised r&iuml;&iquest;&half;les<br/>&gt; &gt;   analogous to the specialised r&iuml;&iquest;&half;le of a tonic.  However, I&apos;m<br/>&gt; &gt;   unsure whether by &quot;priority function&quot; you simply mean that<br/>&gt; &gt;   the tonic is counted as &quot;first step&quot; in the scale (ladder), or<br/>&gt; &gt;   do you mean that the tonic is more important than other<br/>&gt; &gt;   pitches?  And if the latter, melodically or harmonically?</p><p>&gt; All of them of course.</p><p>[YA]  If so, I&apos;d rather a definition that stated each of those<br/>points explicitly.</p><p>&gt; &gt;   Key/Rag/Maqam:  OK for now.</p><p>&gt; &gt;   Mode:  I take it your definition is the relative one, as in<br/>&gt; &gt;   &quot;the Dorian mode of ...&quot;, or &quot;the Aeolian mode of ...&quot;, say,<br/>&gt; &gt;   C major?</p><p>&gt; How else can one do it? You need first a scale to have a<br/>&gt; mode! The only scale you will ever need for all the Greek<br/>&gt; modes is the C major scale, whose successive degrees<br/>&gt; determine the nature of the mode. The scale itself bears<br/>&gt; no information as to which mode you desire, save for the<br/>&gt; faintest inclination that directs you to choosing the first<br/>&gt; degree by default. Thus, C major scale can be made<br/>&gt; synonymous with C major mode AKA Ionian, as mostly done,<br/>&gt; which I find obstructive to proper methodology.</p><p>[YA]  It&apos;s certainly confusing terminology.  For clarity, we<br/>need to distinguish the C major scale from its first mode.</p><p>&gt; &gt;   A common way of explaining modes in music<br/>&gt; &gt;   textbooks has been along the following lines -<br/>&gt; &gt;   &quot;Take the white keys of the piano, starting at middle C.<br/>&gt; &gt;   Play an ascending scale of eight white notes until you<br/>&gt; &gt;   reach C above middle C.  This is one mode, and its name<br/>&gt; &gt;   is ....  Now start instead on the D above middle C, and play<br/>&gt; &gt;   an ascending scale of eight white notes until you reach<br/>&gt; &gt;   the D above that.  This is another mode, and its name is<br/>&gt; &gt;   ....&quot; (The names vary depending on who you read or listen<br/>&gt; &gt;   to, or how classically Greek their inclinations are; some<br/>&gt; &gt;   prefer the names given by Glareanus.)  Doesn&apos;t sound<br/>&gt; &gt;   like much more than transposing a given scale diatonically<br/>&gt; &gt;   (drawing on the same gamut), does it?<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;   But in terms of ancient Greek practice, or of mediaeval<br/>&gt; &gt;   church practice, a mode was much more than that, and<br/>&gt; &gt;   the usual relationships we expect between notes of a<br/>&gt; &gt;   Western scale didn&apos;t always apply - for example, the<br/>&gt; &gt;   dominant wasn&apos;t always a fifth above the tonic.  Because<br/>&gt; &gt;   of its rules about use of the notes in its gamut, a mode<br/>&gt; &gt;   was more akin to a raga or a maqam than to a scale.</p><p>&gt; Of course! That is why a mode is so much more than a scale.<br/>&gt; It contains information as to which degree is the finalis, and<br/>&gt; which is the co-finalis, and what other functions are ascribed<br/>&gt; to several others.</p><p>[YA] So a gamut is a set of pitches, a scale is an ordering (or<br/>maybe two) of a gamut, a gamme is a particular form of melody<br/>made from a gamut, a mode is a scale plus functions for various<br/>pitches within it.</p><p>&gt; &gt;   Also, as another writer indicated recently on this list,<br/>&gt; &gt;   a &quot;guitar mode&quot; has rather more to do with fingering<br/>&gt; &gt;   than with an abstract selection of pitches.  At least,<br/>&gt; &gt;   that&apos;s what I think they meant, and if I&apos;m wrong,<br/>&gt; &gt;   someone&apos;s bound to correct me :-)</p><p>&gt; We digress. Let us regress.</p><p>[YA]  Where&apos;s the digression?  That&apos;s all the word  &quot;mode&quot;<br/>means to most guitarists.  Yes, I know they&apos;re not all<br/>pianists, but we eschew cultural superiority, right? :-)</p><p>&gt; &gt;   Surely a transposed scale is still a scale?</p><p>&gt; A transposed scale in reference to a scale superimposed<br/>&gt; over itself? That would extend the range of the gamut as<br/>&gt; well as adding new pitches which must be dealt with.</p><p>[YA]  Not at all what I meant!  By &quot;diatonic transposition&quot;<br/>I mean moving &quot;thru the tones&quot; - essentially choosing a<br/>different starting point within the same set of notes.<br/>Nothing more.  No new notes are added.</p><p>&gt; A scale is only a list of intervals,</p><p>[YA]  Are you sure about that?  This is almost where we<br/>started ...</p><p>&gt; if you transpose the globule of pitches within the scale<br/>&gt; and overlap this over itself, the result is a scale which<br/>&gt; is bigger and more complicated to begin with.</p><p>[YA]  You are right, but no-one was talking about doing<br/>that.</p><p>&gt; I understand that you are referring to transposing the<br/>&gt; C major mode to another degree of the C major scale,</p><p>[YA]  You misunderstand me.  That would be a chromatic<br/>transposition.</p><p>&gt; at which point, the resulting mode will be identical in<br/>&gt; every way with the previous mode, its interval structure<br/>&gt; will be the same, while the scale itself is now extended.<br/>&gt; In such a case, and if the passage is fluid/dynamic/<br/>&gt; transient where certain degrees are given important<br/>&gt; roles, we are dealing with the Key of C Major, which is<br/>&gt; surely much more than the C major mode, let alone C<br/>&gt; major scale!</p><p>[YA]  The Key of C Major has, perhaps greater and perhaps<br/>merely different, harmonic implications than the C major<br/>mode.  But I wasn&apos;t talking about keys.  At least, not yet.</p><p>&gt; &gt;   To avoid<br/>&gt; &gt;   confusion with received musical usage, I think we need<br/>&gt; &gt;   to accept that the term &quot;mode&quot; has as least the following<br/>&gt; &gt;   four distinct meanings -<br/>&gt; &gt;   1.  A Greek mode - An ancient Greek scale, with rules like a maqam.<br/>&gt; &gt;   2.  An ecclesiastical mode - a mediaeval church scale, with rules<br/>&gt; &gt;   like a maqam.<br/>&gt; &gt;   3.  The mode of the nth degree, or the nth mode, of a given key -<br/>&gt; &gt;   a diatonic transposition of a common-practice scale upwards by<br/>&gt; &gt;   n scale degrees.<br/>&gt; &gt;   4.  A guitar mode - a fingering pattern on the guitar.</p><p>&gt; I concur with all this information, save for the fact that a maqam<br/>&gt; is much more than a mode, simply because, like the key of C major,<br/>&gt; it contains information as to which modulations and transpositions<br/>&gt; are made available to the composer.</p><p>[YA]  You&apos;re the expert on maqamat.   Instead of saying -<br/>&quot;with rules like a maqam&quot;, perhaps I should just say &quot;with rules<br/>governing melodic succession&quot;.</p><p>&gt; For example, one can, with masterful articulation, use the fourth<br/>&gt; degree of Huzzam as a stepping stone to Nihavend like this:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Ed F G Ad Bd C Bd Ad G F Ed D/# Ed<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; G Ad Bb C Bb Ad G F<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Where the comma-flats are most flexible.</p><p>[YA] Thank you for the example.  I&apos;d have to hear it to appreciate<br/>it properly.</p><p>&gt; I never heard of a mode where one can suddenly enter the<br/>&gt; sphere of another mode.</p><p>[YA]  Or it wouldn&apos;t be a mode, would it?  Same restriction governs<br/>the use of ragas.  One raga never changes to another within the same<br/>composition.  That you can or would do this with maqamat both<br/>surprises and intrigues me.  How is it possible to do so, I wonder,<br/>without destroying the unity of mood that one maqam establishes?</p><p>&gt; &gt;   Possibly we could press the ancient Greek terms tonos (plural<br/>&gt; &gt;   tonoi) and tropos (plural tropoi) back into service to avoid using<br/>&gt; &gt;   terms that are now overladen with meaning.  (I say &quot;overladen&quot;,<br/>&gt; &gt;   because it&apos;s bad, like the straw that broke the camel&apos;s back,<br/>&gt; &gt;   rather than &quot;overloaded&quot;, which is regarded as good practice in<br/>&gt; &gt;   object-oriented programming (OOP) circles.  Come to think of it,<br/>&gt; &gt;   perhaps the OOP paradigm could be more fruitful for discussing<br/>&gt; &gt;   musical tuning than abstract algebra has been - it certainly offers<br/>&gt; &gt;   some suggestive terms, including &quot;class&quot; and &quot;method&quot;.  Perhaps<br/>&gt; &gt;   we should start a tuning-OOP list?  I could hide all my gaffes<br/>&gt; &gt;   there ...)</p><p>&gt; I am most excited about new terms. And, if it will clear the confusion,<br/>&gt; I will refer to gamut as gamme from this point forth.</p><p>[YA]  If &quot;gamme&quot; then means - for us at least! - the practice of playing<br/>all the notes of a scale, from botom to top and back a gain, as a melody,<br/>I&apos;m content to use it that way.  Trouble is, I think that most of our<br/>Francophone friends wouldn&apos;t want it to no longer also mean &quot;scale&quot; in<br/>all its musical senses ...</p><p>&gt; &gt;   But do tell me, Ozan, since you avoided the &quot;metric&quot; and &quot;distance&quot;<br/>&gt; &gt;   terms completely - what are your ideas on that subject?<br/>&gt; &gt;   Regards,<br/>&gt; &gt;   Yahya</p><p>&gt; I lack the technical capacity to fill in the details for those.  Perhaps<br/>&gt; you might brief me on them.</p><p>[YA]  There are several notions of distance in music.  The simplest to<br/>use just counts scale degrees.  So a fifth is four notes (scale degrees)<br/>away from a unison, three notes from a second, two notes from a third<br/>and one note from a fourth.</p><p>A more complex one, such as the one given by James Tenney, give the<br/>distance of a note (from a reference note) which is at a pitch n/d times<br/>that of the reference note, as -<br/> &#x9;HD (n/d)  = k . log (n . d)<br/>Here n is the numerator and d the denominator of the pitch ratio, and<br/>both are presumed to be integers.  k is any convenient constant, and if<br/>you want to measure harmonic distance along the chain of perfect<br/>fifths, you could take it to be 1 / log (3 . 2).  We take logs so that the<br/>HD of, say, a fifth is unchanged by octave transposition of both pitches<br/>in the interval.  From this definition it follows that if a perfect fifth is<br/>one step, a just major second is two steps, a major sixth is three and so<br/>on.  I draw my entire knowledge of this measure, or &quot;metric&quot;, from the<br/>paper Paul Erlich kindly sent me to study.</p><p>So much for the technical side ... on the side of musical feeling and<br/>intuition, do you ever count, as I do, the number of melodic movements<br/>away from the tonic?  So that, for example, in C minor, Ab is only<br/>related to the tonic note C in the second degree, wanting - if aiming at<br/>arriving at C - to move first to G, F or possibly Bb.  Whereas the G or<br/>the F might move directly to the C, although still more likely to get<br/>there in stages.  I only get this sense in a more melismatic style of<br/>composition, which precludes large leaps, except for effect.  But in<br/>such a style, I find that the distances of notes is determined firstly<br/>by the number of scale steps intervening, and secondly by the number<br/>of spiral-of-fifths steps intervening, between them.  What exact<br/>proportion each contributes, I couldn&apos;t say, and it does seem to vary<br/>with the mood of the piece - not scientific, I know!  But I do know that<br/>a major or minor second is always closer than a third, and a third than<br/>a fifth, while a fifth can sometimes be closer (melodically) than a fourth,<br/>and other times not.</p><p>&gt; Cordially,<br/>&gt; Ozan</p><p>Regards,<br/>Yahya</p></div><h3><a id=58825 href="#58825">ðŸ”—</a>klaus schmirler &#x3C;KSchmir@online.de&#x3E;</h3><span>5/31/2005 2:48:24 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Yahya Abdal-Aziz wrote:</p><p>&gt;&gt;The beautiful thing about the gamut is that, unlike the &quot;white note<br/>&gt;&gt;scale&quot;, it provides room for alterations.

I have no idea if the finales of the church modes had already been thought of as being next to each other (where is Margo Schulter, by the way?) or if Guido wanted to have them compact; anyway they were on D (mode 1 and 2), E (3 and 4), F (5 and 6) and G (7 and 8) (the odd ones authentic, the even ones plagal). Since the placing of the half steps was determined by the ut-re-mi, the B was typically mi when starting on G (&quot;Mixolydian&quot;, the Berkleeans say) and fa when starting on F (&quot;But that makes it Ionian!&quot; - making the point that you&apos;re bound to reap confusion when you mix terminologies). There were mixed modes, as in the obvious case when a melody exceeded an octave and you went like from authentic to plagal, or when a note changed its &quot;interpretation&quot;. BTW, the infamous &quot;mi contra fa, diabolus in musica&quot; in the solmisation system described the &quot;forbidden&quot; interval class of the augmented second and the augmented fourth.</p><p>&gt; &gt; [YA]  I think your &quot;original gamut&quot; is a structure with special<br/>&gt; relationships between pitches over more than an octave, isn&apos;t<br/>&gt; it?  In which case, octave reductions is essentially foreign to<br/>&gt; its nature.  (As, for example, in a tuning system that contains<br/>&gt; only the overtones of a given fundamental pitch C0, the notes<br/>&gt; C1 an octave higher, G1 a twelfth higher, C2 two octaves higher,<br/>&gt; E2, G2, Bb2, C3, D3, E3 ... belong to the system, but E1, Bb1 and<br/>&gt; D1 don&apos;t.)</p><p>Yes. The lowest B had no F under it and so could only be B mi=B natural. But since the same principle applies to all the octaves, I see no problem in generalizing &quot;B can be soft or hard (flat or natural)&quot;. And no matter how many octaves and principles apply, I think you can octave recude anything if you only called it that.</p><p>&gt;&gt;&gt;1.

The mode of the nth degree, or the nth mode, of a given key -<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt;a diatonic transposition of a common-practice scale upwards by<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt;n scale degrees.<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt;4.

Why not<br/>&gt; just &quot;the 4th tone&quot; and so on?</p><p>They really said &quot;of the nth tone&quot;, and since they said it in Latin they had a case for that and didn&apos;t need a preposition. &quot;&apos;Ut queant laxis&apos; cantus secundi toni est.&quot; A system very specific to the mediaval system of eight tones/modes; I wouldn&apos;t want to make this universal. But ...</p><p>&gt;&gt;On the other hand, I think you might just as well replace the Berklee<br/>&gt;&gt;modes by referring to the tonality and scale degrees directly. Jazz<br/>&gt;&gt;theory is about chords whereas we are trying to talk about melody.<br/>&gt; &gt; [YA]  I guess calling them modes may have some practical benefits for<br/>&gt; guitarists who frequently discuss them.  Anyone care to comment?</p><p>The world in general is immersed in Berklee students. These are the only uses and names for &quot;mode&quot; that the vast majority is familiar with, and even if they have no practical value whatsoever (show me one), they will stick. However, I have been thinking before about a term that Ernst Krenek used for serial music (for putting the first note of a row at its end) and that I saw today in Dave Keenan&apos;s article &quot;Optimising JI guitar designs ...&quot; in the very same sense that we need to replace the Berklee modes: ROTATION. It has little cultural bagagge, it already seems to be in use, and it really means what it says, nothing more: that you start an ordered set at different places. Optimal term.</p><p>I would make a hierarchy of your modified four meanings-of-mode above:</p><p>A. gamut, tonal system: a repository of notes which may be derived from some tuning idea just come along with your instrument (like the overblown tone of a didgeridoo). The only demand is that to play these notes be possible</p><p>B. maqamat, modi, rags, melody types: describe the use of tones from a repository (I would use &quot;mode&quot; for the general term, but any other will do - just desribe its specific rules). It extracts scales from the gamut, but normally will have rules for other then scalar orderings.</p><p>C. rotations of the scale. A tonic stays a tonic, a leading tone stays a leading tone (sequences and underlying chords may momentarily suspend these functions). Can be used as an ornament, a practice pattern, and also (my concession to Berklee) to think of the mode in a certain way.</p><p>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;(I say &quot;overladen&quot;,<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt;because it&apos;s bad, like the straw that broke the camel&apos;s back,<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt;rather than &quot;overloaded&quot;, which is regarded as good practice in<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt;object-oriented programming (OOP) circles.  Come to think of it,<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt;perhaps the OOP paradigm<br/>&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt;Ah, I see it now; the explanation is right before the parentheses.<br/>&gt;&gt;Would that be like me saying that you get a scale by applying a mode<br/>&gt;&gt;to a gamut?<br/>&gt; &gt; [YA]  Yes.  Your usage of &quot;mode&quot; and Ozan&apos;s seem to match, then.</p><p>&lt;baffled&gt; No they don&apos;t.</p><p>&lt;After a while, and having read the other post written all the above&gt; Of course, he has taken &quot;gamut&quot; for &quot;gamme&quot; all along, whereas in contemporary computer English it means palette, and a German will naturally refer to the original meaning since the word is extinct here. I also see how my sentence could be read in an Ozan-compatible way. Let me try again:</p><p>A scale is the result of extracting notes from a gamut (in the case of a piano: the 88 keys) using the rules of a mode.</p><p>I had thought that you, Yahya, had meant the same all along using more or less the same words. I also think that Ozan can live well with the statement, but he has &quot;refused&quot; to understand because he stuck to &quot;contemporary western&quot; usages of our words (in France/Belgium and the Berklee school) while you and I were trying to name musical phenomena in different cultures.

I have no idea if the finales of the church modes had<br/>already been thought of as being next to each other (where is Margo<br/>Schulter, by the way?) or if Guido wanted to have them compact; anyway<br/>they were on D (mode 1 and 2), E (3 and 4), F (5 and 6) and G (7 and<br/>8) (the odd ones authentic, the even ones plagal). Since the placing<br/>of the half steps was determined by the ut-re-mi, the B was typically<br/>mi when starting on G (&quot;Mixolydian&quot;, the Berkleeans say) and fa when<br/>starting on F (&quot;But that makes it Ionian!&quot; - making the point that<br/>you&apos;re bound to reap confusion when you mix terminologies). There were<br/>mixed modes, as in the obvious case when a melody exceeded an octave<br/>and you went like from authentic to plagal, or when a note changed its<br/>&quot;interpretation&quot;. BTW, the infamous &quot;mi contra fa, diabolus in musica&quot;<br/>in the solmisation system described the &quot;forbidden&quot; interval class of<br/>the augmented second and the augmented fourth.</p><p>&gt;<br/>&gt; [YA]  I think your &quot;original gamut&quot; is a structure with special<br/>&gt; relationships between pitches over more than an octave, isn&apos;t<br/>&gt; it?  In which case, octave reductions is essentially foreign to<br/>&gt; its nature.  (As, for example, in a tuning system that contains<br/>&gt; only the overtones of a given fundamental pitch C0, the notes<br/>&gt; C1 an octave higher, G1 a twelfth higher, C2 two octaves higher,<br/>&gt; E2, G2, Bb2, C3, D3, E3 ... belong to the system, but E1, Bb1 and<br/>&gt; D1 don&apos;t.)</p><p>Yes. The lowest B had no F under it and so could only be B mi=B<br/>natural. But since the same principle applies to all the octaves, I<br/>see no problem in generalizing &quot;B can be soft or hard (flat or<br/>natural)&quot;. And no matter how many octaves and principles apply, I<br/>think you can octave recude anything if you only called it that.</p><p>&gt;&gt;&gt;1.  A Greek mode - An ancient Greek scale, with rules like a maqam.<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt;2.  An ecclesiastical mode - a mediaeval church scale, with rules<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt;like a maqam.<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt;3.  The mode of the nth degree, or the nth mode, of a given key -<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt;a diatonic transposition of a common-practice scale upwards by<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt;n scale degrees.<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt;4.  A guitar mode - a fingering pattern on the guitar.<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt;Possibly we could press the ancient Greek terms tonos (plural<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt;tonoi) and tropos (plural tropoi) back into service to avoid using<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt;terms that are now overladen with meaning.<br/>&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt;I think 1. and 2. have enough in common to be called by the same names<br/>&gt;&gt;(but I think it doesn&apos;t hurt when you stay with names of the original<br/>&gt;&gt;cultures, if that culture bothered to theorize). Church modes<br/>&gt;&gt;originally were mostly called &quot;in the nth tone&quot; originally, so why<br/>&gt;&gt;not? (I have to admit that I&apos;m not clear on the meaning of tonoi and<br/>&gt;&gt;tropoi, though).<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; [YA]  Good enough for me, but a trifle longwinded perhaps?  Why not<br/>&gt; just &quot;the 4th tone&quot; and so on?</p><p>They really said &quot;of the nth tone&quot;, and since they said it in Latin<br/>they had a case for that and didn&apos;t need a preposition. &quot;&apos;Ut queant<br/>laxis&apos; cantus secundi toni est.&quot; A system very specific to the<br/>mediaval system of eight tones/modes; I wouldn&apos;t want to make this<br/>universal. But ...</p><p>[YA]  So we should use a genitive constructins like &quot;the 4th tone&apos;s&quot;?<br/>No, I don&apos;t think so ... :-)</p><p>&gt;&gt;On the other hand, I think you might just as well replace the Berklee<br/>&gt;&gt;modes by referring to the tonality and scale degrees directly.

That leaves us with a<br/>9-tone<br/>set of pitches in a minor scale, as Johnny says he teaches.

I also see how my sentence could be read in an Ozan-compatible<br/>way. Let me try again:</p><p>A scale is the result of extracting notes from a gamut (in the case of<br/>a piano: the 88 keys) using the rules of a mode.</p><p>I had thought that you, Yahya, had meant the same all along using more<br/>or less the same words.

In Common Practice, it&apos;s the fiddler who has to adapt to the piano and not the piano that is considered deficient for its few and discrete pitches. For a didgeridoo, there is no tuning system. You have a fundamental and an overblown that theoretically should be a twelfth, but is usually bent god knows where. In Gagaku, every instrument has its own system from tuneable strings to fixed pipes to glissandos, and they all coexist in the same piece of music. Scales that follow a ratio (I&apos;m not even talking about the mathematical sense here) are but a subset.

I say your idea of music determines the selection. Let&apos;s say your gamut is a series of 8 pitches arrived at by tuning consecutive fifths. You name them from A to G in pitch order, calling the two that are closest together both B. Theses pitches are expected in your musical culture, and all the modes share them (perhaps leaving out one note or another).</p><p>Then you decide to write a hymn in the first mode, later called Dorian by Glarean. You pick D as your finalis, probably start with the finalis itself or a melodic cadence approaching the finalis (like the tone below it), use the tones in the octave above D, have A and F as recitation tones, are free to jump from D up to A and further from A to C, and flatten the B if the notes before and after it are As. If you apply other rules (treating D, F, A and C as resting tones and the others as approaches) you are not playing the same mode.<br/>&gt; &gt; The only one of these notions that seems to be problematical is that a scale<br/>&gt; is more than a set of pitches (or, equivalently, of intervals).

Still, this is<br/>&gt; contrary to my feeling that a minor scale has seven tones, two of which are<br/>&gt; mutable, that is,  take different forms depending on context.</p><p>With major and minor, I am still at mode level. Things are a little more complicated here since simultaneous tones may influence their respective functions (f in FM vs f in G7) and modulating to a transposition of the mode is an expected part of the tonal language, so the gamut is an open or circular meantone system.</p><p>Melodic minor as a mode has nine tones. Among its rules are &quot;Skip the first and third tone if the melody goes from the fifth degree up to the tonic&quot; and &quot;Skip the first and third tone if the melody goes from the tonic down to the fifth degree&quot;. So the mode produces two different scales of seven tones each. Scales are just the outcome of the rules applied by the mode and are relatively uninteresting where there is only one scale (as in major).</p><p>Last part: These scales can be rotated.</p><p>Next round ...</p><p>klaus</p></div><h3><a id=58840 href="#58840">ðŸ”—</a>Yahya Abdal-Aziz &#x3C;yahya@melbpc.org.au&#x3E;</h3><span>6/1/2005 7:44:30 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Klaus,</p><p>Further replies to yours.<br/>Are we getting close yet? :-)</p><p>Regards,<br/>Yahya</p><p>-----Original Message-----<br/>________________________________________________________________________<br/>   Date: Tue, 31 May 2005 17:51:54 +0200<br/>   From: klaus schmirler &lt;KSchmir@...&gt;</p><p>&gt; [YA]  So we should use a genitive constructins like &quot;the 4th tone&apos;s&quot;?<br/>&gt; No, I don&apos;t think so ... :-)</p><p>And actually, what I meant in the part above that I cut was that the<br/>modes were called tones when they applied to the interval structure,<br/>just like the Greek tonoi.

(*)<br/>&gt; C. mode - set of rules for the use of notes of a scale.<br/>&gt; D. rotation - a rule for rotating the interval pattern in a scale.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; (*) For example, the major scale selects the LLsLLLs pattern in every<br/>&gt; octave,<br/>&gt; for both rising and falling melodies, and for all harmonisations;<br/>&gt; while the melodic minor scale selects the LsLLLLs pattern in every octave<br/>&gt; for rising melodies and the LLsLLsL pattern in every octave for falling<br/>&gt; melodies.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; In these terms, given any gamut, you can draw a number of scales from it;<br/>&gt; you may apply as many different rules as your imagination permits to the<br/>&gt; notes of a scale to create a mode; and a rotation is just a particular<br/>kind<br/>&gt; of mode.</p><p>Here we have it: You take some selection from the gamut and then think<br/>about the kind of music you want to make. I say your idea of music<br/>determines the selection. Let&apos;s say your gamut is a series of 8<br/>pitches arrived at by tuning consecutive fifths. You name them from A<br/>to G in pitch order, calling the two that are closest together both B.<br/>Theses pitches are expected in your musical culture, and all the modes<br/>share them (perhaps leaving out one note or another).</p><p>Then you decide to write a hymn in the first mode, later called Dorian<br/>by Glarean. You pick D as your finalis, probably start with the<br/>finalis itself or a melodic cadence approaching the finalis (like the<br/>tone below it), use the tones in the octave above D, have A and F as<br/>recitation tones, are free to jump from D up to A and further from A<br/>to C, and flatten the B if the notes before and after it are As. If<br/>you apply other rules (treating D, F, A and C as resting tones and the<br/>others as approaches) you are not playing the same mode.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; The only one of these notions that seems to be problematical is that a<br/>scale<br/>&gt; is more than a set of pitches (or, equivalently, of intervals).  The only<br/>&gt; way<br/>&gt; I see around the difficulty is to make the choice of different subsets of<br/>&gt; my definition just one of the rules for a mode.  That leaves us with a<br/>&gt; 9-tone<br/>&gt; set of pitches in a minor scale, as Johnny says he teaches.  Still, this<br/>is<br/>&gt; contrary to my feeling that a minor scale has seven tones, two of which<br/>are<br/>&gt; mutable, that is,  take different forms depending on context.</p><p>With major and minor, I am still at mode level. Things are a little<br/>more complicated here since simultaneous tones may influence their<br/>respective functions (f in FM vs f in G7) and modulating to a<br/>transposition of the mode is an expected part of the tonal language,<br/>so the gamut is an open or circular meantone system.</p><p>[YA]  And talking ofthe major mode or the minor mode has precedent.<br/>So now we have this structure -<br/>A. gamut - set of available pitches.<br/>B. mode - set of rules for the use of notes from a gamut in different<br/>melodic or harmonic contexts.<br/>C. scale - set of subsets of the gamut selected by a mode.

So the mode produces two<br/>different scales of seven tones each.

Since I think that &quot;tonal&quot; and &quot;modal&quot; are well accepted adjectives for the description of cadence oriented and melody oriented music, I&apos;d stick to the noun &quot;mode&quot; (although I talk about chords and chord functions instead of tones for that other principle). So you don&apos;t say &quot;We&apos;ll call this rag tropos X&quot; but stick to the rag&apos;s name and explain &quot;It&apos;s a mode, tropos or even melody type that leaves out the seventh degree&quot;. (I abhor all that scale and temperament naming on this list that is for the most part not descriptive at all, or at best privately so.)</p><p>&gt; Diatonic transposition, of course, is a way of coming up with<br/>&gt; surprising melodies because you combine the melodic rules of one mode<br/>&gt; (in the original sense) with the interval structure of another.<br/>&gt; &gt; [YA]  And as a technique, far predates modern guitar methods, or<br/>&gt; Schillnger for that matter ...</p><p>I think Schillinger used it for thematic invention, and I believe that interval structures and melody rules go hand in hand, so this is a very artificial and &quot;postmodern&quot; thing to do. Applied to motives, in sequences, sure.</p><p>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;--------<br/>&gt;&gt;However, I have been thinking before about a<br/>&gt;&gt;term that Ernst Krenek used for serial music (for putting the first<br/>&gt;&gt;note of a row at its end) and that I saw today in Dave Keenan&apos;s<br/>&gt;&gt;article &quot;Optimising JI guitar designs ...&quot; in the very same sense that<br/>&gt;&gt;we need to replace the Berklee modes: ROTATION. It has little cultural<br/>&gt;&gt;bagagge, it already seems to be in use, and it really means what it<br/>&gt;&gt;says, nothing more: that you start an ordered set at different places.<br/>&gt;&gt;Optimal term.<br/>&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt;[YA]  A term very suitable to our purpose, I think.<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; Which could be adapted to the jazz/pop terminology without hurt by<br/>&gt; just talking about the Dorian rotation instead of the Dorian mode.<br/>&gt; Yes, I like it.<br/>&gt; &gt; [YA]   Aha!  Agreed, then?</p><p>I already used it last night. I, for one, will stick with it. But in the last post (I will probably snip that part) I was talking about rotating a mode which is messing up our hierarchy, or (unless you&apos;re Schillinger) nonsense. So I have to be careful about that.</p><p>&gt;&gt;A. gamut, tonal system: a repository of notes which may be derived<br/>&gt;&gt;from some tuning idea just come along with your instrument (like the<br/>&gt;&gt;overblown tone of a didgeridoo). The only demand is that to play these<br/>&gt;&gt;notes be possible<br/>&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt;B. maqamat, modi, rags, melody types: describe the use of tones from a<br/>&gt;&gt;repository (I would use &quot;mode&quot; for the general term, but any other<br/>&gt;&gt;will do - just desribe its specific rules). It extracts scales from<br/>&gt;&gt;the gamut, but normally will have rules for other then scalar orderings.<br/>&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt;C. rotations of the scale. A tonic stays a tonic, a leading tone stays<br/>&gt;&gt;a leading tone (sequences and underlying chords may momentarily<br/>&gt;&gt;suspend these functions). Can be used as an ornament, a practice<br/>&gt;&gt;pattern, and also (my concession to Berklee) to think of the mode in a<br/>&gt;&gt;certain way.<br/>&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt;[YA]  A useful and realistic hierarchy between tuning terms may prove<br/>&gt;&gt;difficult to establish.  Suppose we start with A. = gamut or tuning<br/>&gt; &gt; system.<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt;More than just a set of pitches, it is a set related by being tunable or<br/>&gt;&gt;playable on an (actual, or hypothetical?, or abstract?) instrument.<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; Many musics have an archetypical instrument that will determine that.<br/>&gt; In Common Practice, it&apos;s the fiddler who has to adapt to the piano and<br/>&gt; not the piano that is considered deficient for its few and discrete<br/>&gt; pitches. For a didgeridoo, there is no tuning system. You have a<br/>&gt; fundamental and an overblown that theoretically should be a twelfth,<br/>&gt; but is usually bent god knows where. In Gagaku, every instrument has<br/>&gt; its own system from tuneable strings to fixed pipes to glissandos, and<br/>&gt; they all coexist in the same piece of music. Scales that follow a<br/>&gt; ratio (I&apos;m not even talking about the mathematical sense here) are but<br/>&gt; a subset. So I would say, your scale in the hierarchy below is my<br/>&gt; gamut: an already limited selsction from the pitch continuum because<br/>&gt; of theoretical or practical considerations.<br/>&gt; &gt; [YA]  No, I had the &quot;theoretical or practical considerations&quot; determine<br/>&gt; the gamut; the scale (as I used it below) was drawn from the gamut.</p><p>I misunderstood you there.</p><p>&gt; &gt;&gt;Then modes, in your sense B. of rules for the use of pitches in the<br/>&gt;&gt;gamut, are built upon the gamut.  Interestingly, one of the most important<br/>&gt;&gt;rules of any mode is &quot;don&apos;t use these notes at all!&quot;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; Probably less if you have a primitive instrument (on a didgeridoo you<br/>&gt; have a fundamental and that other note and work with rhythm and pitch<br/>&gt; accents, and everything new you come up with will be idiomatic<br/>&gt; didgeridoo music) and more so if the instrument has more &quot;universal&quot;<br/>&gt; ambitions (like a piano that has had many idiomatic styles in the<br/>&gt; course of history and can still be used for playing orchestra scores -<br/>&gt; or like the trumpet before and after it had valves).<br/>&gt; &gt;    But does the gamut of<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt;the mode remain the whole set of notes playable on the instrument?  That<br/>&gt;&gt;seems counter-intuitive.<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; What about the set of notes _expected_ from the instrument?<br/>&gt; &gt; [YA]  Good!  &quot;A gamut is a set of notes expected from an<br/>&gt; archetypical instrument based on certain theoretical and<br/>&gt; practical considerations.&quot;  Gee, it&apos;s almost legalese ...</p><p>I used the instrument to emphasize that the music and the instruments to play it were probably there before the theory. If you want to fix your intervals on a stringed instrument, you will probably tune third to second harmonics all the way and get a Pythagorean system. If you start out with an alpenhorn or a mouthbow, you don&apos;t even have much choice and build your melodies from the harmonic series. So a gamut can be just &quot;a set of notes expected to occur in a musical culture.&quot;</p><p>&gt; &gt;&gt;I&apos;d prefer to describe the structure as -<br/>&gt;&gt;A. gamut - set of available pitches.<br/>&gt;&gt;B. scale - set of subsets of the gamut for use in different melodic or<br/>&gt;&gt;harmonic contexts.  (*)<br/>&gt;&gt;C. mode - set of rules for the use of notes of a scale.<br/>&gt;&gt;D. rotation - a rule for rotating the interval pattern in a scale.<br/>&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt;(*) For example, the major scale selects the LLsLLLs pattern in every<br/>&gt;&gt;octave,<br/>&gt;&gt;for both rising and falling melodies, and for all harmonisations;<br/>&gt;&gt;while the melodic minor scale selects the LsLLLLs pattern in every octave<br/>&gt;&gt;for rising melodies and the LLsLLsL pattern in every octave for falling<br/>&gt;&gt;melodies.<br/>&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt;In these terms, given any gamut, you can draw a number of scales from it;<br/>&gt;&gt;you may apply as many different rules as your imagination permits to the<br/>&gt;&gt;notes of a scale to create a mode; and a rotation is just a particular<br/>&gt; &gt; kind<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt;of mode.<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; Here we have it: You take some selection from the gamut and then think<br/>&gt; about the kind of music you want to make.

But I think they mixed that with the other concept of moving tonics to another string, and the results are super complicated in my humble opinion (and to my humble mind). If you like to think like that, [big pause] you&apos;d have to specify retunings in different contexts. This is at odds with my way of thinking, where all the notes that can be correct are provided at their specific pitches in the gamut, the modes provide the context for using some of them and leaving others. I think it isn&apos;t the case, but if you are more comfortable with thinking in terms of retuning instead of picking up a note, there may still be issues hidden.</p><p>&gt; &gt; &gt; With major and minor, I am still at mode level.

Melodic minor on the tonic C gives you G Ab A Bb B C from the gamut. Going down from C you skip B and A, going up from G you skip Ab and Bb. I thought since the mode provides more notes than are used in a scale, it was clearer describing the scale in terms of not playing certain notes.

Tonleiter, Skala; It. scala, gamma; Sp. escala gamma) A collection of pitches arranged in order from lowest to highest or from highest to lowest. The pitches of any music in which pitch is definable can be reduced to a scale. The concept and its pedagogical use have been especially prominent in the history of Western are music. The importance of the concept in non-Western systems varies considerably and is often associated with concepts of melody construction and internal pitch relationships that go well beyond any simple ordering of pitches from lowest to highest (see also Mode, Melody type). Even in Western tonal music, however, scales are only a reflection of compositional practice that includes notions of appropriate melodic progression and the functions of individual pitches in relation to one another. With respect to nontonal Western music, a scale is likely to be simply an arbitrary represantation of pitch content that contributes little to an understanding of a given work.</p><p>...</p><p>The rest of the definition tells us how the total pitch world of Western tonal music is consigned to 12 pitch-classes, how a scale out of these 12 pitches can be made to choose any one of the 12 tones as its starting point, how repetitions through any number of octaves may occur, how the diatonic scale is central to the idea of tonal music, how any of the seven pitches of such a scale can be taken as the starting point for rearranging the order of tones and semitones (thus resulting in what is called the &grave;octave species&grave; or &grave;modes&grave;), how all but one of these (starting with B) have been recognized in both theory and practice, thus, forming part of the system of modes, and how only two of these have gained prominence.</p><p>Moreover, there is hardly any distinction when it is said: &quot;The major mode or major scale takes the pattern produced by starting upward through the diatonic scale from C.&quot; except for the fact that the minor scale or mode is distinguished in regards to its &quot;starting point&quot; and &quot;hierarchical relationship (functions) of pitches&quot;.</p><p>Obviously, the &quot;major mode&quot; is made synonymous here with &quot;major scale&quot; just as it is the case with its minor counterpart.</p><p>To add insult to injury, let me confess that I&apos;m so confused now that nothing makes sense anymore.</p><p>Here comes the greatest sentence: &quot;A composition based PRIMARILY on a given scale is said to be the KEY of that scale.&quot;</p><p>This refutes the argument that maqams are modes, since everyone knows that a maqam is &quot;a scale or several scales upon which a composition is PRIMARILY based upon&quot;</p><p>The above-given definition of &quot;maqam&quot; is based on the premise that: &quot;scales are simply abstractions from musical practice rather than musical objects with prior or independent standing.&quot; and that modes are &quot;any of a series of loosely related concepts employed in the study and classification of both scales and melodies&quot;.</p><p>&quot;Loosely related&quot; is certainly not the proper term to brand maqams with. On the contrary, maqams are &quot;very elaborately woven&quot; with many many functions assigned to the pitches that aid in the melodic flow of music.</p><p>To make the distinction better, here is continuation of the definition of mode from the same source:</p><p>&quot;The term (mode) is oftern restricted to scale types defined as collections of pitches arranged from lowest to highest, each including one pitch that is regarded as central. At another extreme, some concepts of mode emphasize melody types; any given mode is defined principally by characteristic melodic elements. Other concepts of mode range between these extremes. No single concept usefully embraces all that has been meant by the term throughout the the history of Western music as well as all that is meant by the terms associated with non-Western music that have at one time or another been translated as mode.&quot;</p><p>It is clear, that had non-Westerners knew of the wonderfully adequate term called &quot;key&quot; as a translation of &quot;maqam/destgah/rag&quot;, they would never have attempted to stretch the definition of mode to what it has become today.</p><p>[YA]  This is only halfway to being a scale as I understand it.<br/>Or does your &quot;C melodic minor scale&quot; consist of 9 notes to every<br/>octave, arranged in order of increasing pitch, so that it contains<br/>both a minor sixth degree and a major sixth degree, and likewise<br/>for sevenths?  My &quot;C melodic minor scale&quot; consists of 7 notes to<br/>every octave in one pattern ascending, and of 7 notes to every<br/>octave in another pattern descending, so that it contains<br/>only a major sixth degree when ascending, and only a minor sixth<br/>degree when descending,  and likewise for sevenths.  My scale is<br/>a set of patterns of melodic movement, built on a gamut of 9 notes.</p><p>[OZ]     Indeed, I concur with the second definition where two kinds of &quot;scales&quot; (first to be ascended, the other to be descended) make the &quot;gamme-mode-species?&quot; of melodic minor.</p><p>[YA]  I understand that your halfway-scale (= gamut+pitch order)<br/>does not distinguish a tonic starting-point.  Certainly it contains a<br/>lowest note of the gamut, which may have nothing to do with<br/>anything but the pitch limitations of the instrument.  A scale in my<br/>sense also does not require a fixed starting-point; however, _in a<br/>given context of musical practice_, the two patterns of notes<br/>provided by my &quot;C melodic minor scale&quot; only occur in a key called<br/>&quot;C minor&quot;.</p><p>[OZ] Does this mean that hundreds of Scala files need to be rid of the word scale, and replaced with gamut?</p><p>&gt; How can this be? It is the gamut that is ascending-descending<br/>&gt; the scale(s). The scale is merely the foothold for whatever is<br/>&gt; moving over it.</p><p>[YA]  In music, what moves?  Melody, rhythm, harmony.  A melody<br/>in C minor moves over the notes of the C (melodic) minor scale.<br/>A complex harmony in C minor moves over the notes of the<br/>C (harmonic) minor scale.  I don&apos;t think the gamut - the collection<br/>of notes - moves at all.  What you consider as moving is the &quot;gamme&quot;<br/>- a melody consisting of many or all notes of a particular (say<br/>C minor) scale.  With enough fingers - or a long stick, I could play<br/>all the notes of the C major gamut on the piano simultaneously.</p><p>[OZ] I still am overladen with the jumble of terms and concepts. But as I see, you are considering the static pile of pitches the gamut. OK. I can live with that I suppose. Never again will I refer to anything tonally mobile by the word starting with ga----!</p><p>&gt; &gt;   Tonic:  Yes, thanks for defining this term.  I think we would<br/>&gt; &gt;   also want, for some musical styles, to define dominant,<br/>&gt; &gt;   mediant, initial, final ... because of their specialised r&ocirc;les<br/>&gt; &gt;   analogous to the specialised r&ocirc;le of a tonic.  However, I&apos;m<br/>&gt; &gt;   unsure whether by &quot;priority function&quot; you simply mean that<br/>&gt; &gt;   the tonic is counted as &quot;first step&quot; in the scale (ladder), or<br/>&gt; &gt;   do you mean that the tonic is more important than other<br/>&gt; &gt;   pitches?  And if the latter, melodically or harmonically?</p><p>&gt; All of them of course.</p><p>[YA]  If so, I&apos;d rather a definition that stated each of those<br/>points explicitly.</p><p>[OZ]   Please... I&apos;m not very successful with that it seems. I&apos;m sure someone else will be much more resourceful in defining the roles of pitches in a &quot;gamut&quot;?</p><p>[YA]  It&apos;s certainly confusing terminology.  For clarity, we<br/>need to distinguish the C major scale from its first mode.</p><p>[OZ]    And how would we do it exactly?</p><p>[YA] So a gamut is a set of pitches, a scale is an ordering (or<br/>maybe two) of a gamut, a gamme is a particular form of melody<br/>made from a gamut, a mode is a scale plus functions for various<br/>pitches within it.</p><p>[OZ]   Can a &quot;gamut&quot; be unordered? If so, how? And how would you define &quot;key&quot;?</p><p>&gt; We digress. Let us regress.</p><p>[YA]  Where&apos;s the digression?  That&apos;s all the word  &quot;mode&quot;<br/>means to most guitarists.  Yes, I know they&apos;re not all<br/>pianists, but we eschew cultural superiority, right? :-)</p><p>[OZ]   It is hard to drop prejudices! Sorry for that act of pretentiousness.</p><p>[YA]  Not at all what I meant!  By &quot;diatonic transposition&quot;<br/>I mean moving &quot;thru the tones&quot; - essentially choosing a<br/>different starting point within the same set of notes.<br/>Nothing more.  No new notes are added.</p><p>[OZ] That manoeuvre results in &quot;octave species&quot; or &quot;modes&quot;. No?</p><p>&gt; A scale is only a list of intervals,</p><p>[YA]  Are you sure about that?  This is almost where we<br/>started ...</p><p>[OZ]  Not anymore! I repent! I&apos;m so confused with the chaos.</p><p>[YA]  You&apos;re the expert on maqamat.   Instead of saying -<br/>&quot;with rules like a maqam&quot;, perhaps I should just say &quot;with rules<br/>governing melodic succession&quot;.</p><p>[OZ]  No, no, not at all. I&apos;m merely a patron of this art form in my own perverse way. 8-)</p><p>&gt; I never heard of a mode where one can suddenly enter the<br/>&gt; sphere of another mode.</p><p>[YA]  Or it wouldn&apos;t be a mode, would it?  Same restriction governs<br/>the use of ragas.  One raga never changes to another within the same<br/>composition.  That you can or would do this with maqamat both<br/>surprises and intrigues me.  How is it possible to do so, I wonder,<br/>without destroying the unity of mood that one maqam establishes?</p><p>[OZ] That is so very easy to explain. How does one not destroy the C majorness of the key in C major although many other tonalities can be utilized through transpositions and modulations? Why does not the C minorness of the key in C minor is not destroyed although I frequent G Major?</p><p>[YA]  If &quot;gamme&quot; then means - for us at least! - the practice of playing<br/>all the notes of a scale, from botom to top and back a gain, as a melody,<br/>I&apos;m content to use it that way.  Trouble is, I think that most of our<br/>Francophone friends wouldn&apos;t want it to no longer also mean &quot;scale&quot; in<br/>all its musical senses ...</p><p>[OZ]    I renounce my evil ways! A thousand pardons to all the Franks!</p><p>[YA]  There are several notions of distance in music.  The simplest to<br/>use just counts scale degrees.  So a fifth is four notes (scale degrees)<br/>away from a unison, three notes from a second, two notes from a third<br/>and one note from a fourth.</p><p>A more complex one, such as the one given by James Tenney, give the<br/>distance of a note (from a reference note) which is at a pitch n/d times<br/>that of the reference note, as -<br/>      HD (n/d)  = k . log (n . d)<br/>Here n is the numerator and d the denominator of the pitch ratio, and<br/>both are presumed to be integers.  k is any convenient constant, and if<br/>you want to measure harmonic distance along the chain of perfect<br/>fifths, you could take it to be 1 / log (3 . 2).  We take logs so that the<br/>HD of, say, a fifth is unchanged by octave transposition of both pitches<br/>in the interval.  From this definition it follows that if a perfect fifth is<br/>one step, a just major second is two steps, a major sixth is three and so<br/>on.  I draw my entire knowledge of this measure, or &quot;metric&quot;, from the<br/>paper Paul Erlich kindly sent me to study.</p><p>[OZ] Then, in simplest layman terms, can I define metric to be &quot;any paradigm for interval measurment?&quot;</p><p>So much for the technical side ... on the side of musical feeling and<br/>intuition, do you ever count, as I do, the number of melodic movements<br/>away from the tonic?  So that, for example, in C minor, Ab is only<br/>related to the tonic note C in the second degree, wanting - if aiming at<br/>arriving at C - to move first to G, F or possibly Bb. Whereas the G or the F might move directly to the C, although still more likely to get there in stages.</p><p>[OZ] As in:</p><p>C-Eb-G-C<br/>Ab-Eb-Ab-C-Eb-Ab<br/>A-F-A-C-Eb-G<br/>Bb-F-Bb-D-F<br/>Ab-D-F#-C-D-F#<br/>G-D-G-B-D-G<br/>C-G-C-Eb-G</p><p>Intuitively, I count them as I improvise, so that I know what may come next, and where they may lead to.</p><p>I only get this sense in a more melismatic style of<br/>composition, which precludes large leaps, except for effect.</p><p>[OZ] A pity... I am partial to large leaps, especially the major seventh!</p><p>But in such a style, I find that the distances of notes is determined firstly by the number of scale steps intervening, and secondly by the number of spiral-of-fifths steps intervening, between them.  What exact<br/>proportion each contributes, I couldn&apos;t say, and it does seem to vary<br/>with the mood of the piece - not scientific, I know!  But I do know that<br/>a major or minor second is always closer than a third, and a third than<br/>a fifth, while a fifth can sometimes be closer (melodically) than a fourth, and other times not.</p><p>[OZ] This has everything to do with counterpoint, the indispensible toolkit of a composer. The hidden meanings of the diatonical degrees can only be revealed by its power.</p><p>Regards,<br/>Yahya</p><p>Cordially,<br/>Ozan</p></div><h3><a id=58852 href="#58852">ðŸ”—</a>Ozan Yarman &#x3C;ozanyarman@superonline.com&#x3E;</h3><span>6/2/2005 3:00:47 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>My concern exactly.</p><p>  ----- Original Message -----<br/>  From: Gene Ward Smith<br/>  To: <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a><br/>  Sent: 02 Haziran 2005 Per&scedil;embe 22:48<br/>  Subject: [tuning] Re: Scales: an lengthy attempt at proper definition</p><p>  --- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, klaus schmirler &lt;KSchmir@o...&gt; wrote:</p><p>  &gt; I think we&apos;re there.

How many names are there for the same scales having their<br/>origins in different cultures? Scala really only has a collection of<br/>scales, to make culture specific music from them you have to know them<br/>as modes.</p><p>I&apos;ve mentioned Aeolian and Hypodorian before. As scales (running their<br/>notes up and down the keyboard), they are identical. As modes, one of<br/>them has its finalis at the bottom of its octave range and the primary<br/>recitation tone is on the fifth degree, whereas the other one has the<br/>finalis in the middle and the recitation tone on the third degree<br/>(counting from the finalis) (and please don&apos;t hold me responsible for<br/>errors in recitation tone placement; I&apos;m no specialist in Gregoran<br/>chant and go by old and little used memories). There may be an Indian<br/>rag that looks exactly like the major scale, but has rules about<br/>postponing the use of certain degrees that are totally foreign to the<br/>major mode, just as the idea that you can end a piece on the tonic in<br/>no matter which octave is foreign to the rag.</p><p>Apart from the loose usage of &quot;scale&quot; for any succession of pitches<br/>which will always be there I see problems mainly for common practice<br/>since most of its rules concern the succession of chords, not of<br/>melody notes. But different melody types do exist, and you might want<br/>to name them.

But your collection of<br/>definitions below shows the state of affairs: so many terms and<br/>definitions that can mean identical or different things. We were just<br/>trying to extract a subset from them that expressed what might be<br/>necessary in a few distinct terms.</p><p>I don&apos;t remember who introduced the term &quot;gamut&quot; in this discussion<br/>and which meaning was intended. It was probably somewhere in the middle between your understanding, coming from French where gamme _is_<br/>a scale plain and simple, and my German, where no cognate of &quot;gamut&quot;<br/>exists, so that I naturally went back to the original meaning. And I<br/>joined the discussion when I felt that the full potential of &quot;gamut&quot;<br/>was being ignored.</p><p>&gt; As for the gamut wars, I rest my case. Nevertheless, I wonder why<br/>&gt; we allow this word to be overloaded when &grave;compass&grave; or &grave;range&grave; would<br/>&gt; do nicely in its stead to define the extent of pitches afforded by<br/>&gt; an instrument.</p><p>Well, the word is overloaded in English. It can mean scale, it can<br/>mean compass, but it also can mean the totality of &quot;recognized&quot;<br/>pitches (according to the New Shorter Oxford). This was the original<br/>meaning.</p><p>[French gamme, English scale: two catchall terms]</p><p>&gt; *<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; The best definition of &grave;scale&grave; is perhaps that of the Harvard<br/>&gt; Dictionary of Music 4th Edition:<br/>&gt; &gt; Scale (Fr. gamme, &eacute;chelle; Ger. Tonleiter, Skala; It. scala, gamma;<br/>&gt; Sp. escala gamma) A collection of pitches arranged in order from<br/>&gt; lowest to highest or from highest to lowest. The pitches of any<br/>&gt; music in which pitch is definable can be reduced to a scale. The<br/>&gt; concept and its pedagogical use have been especially prominent in<br/>&gt; the history of Western are music. The importance of the concept in<br/>&gt; non-Western systems varies considerably and is often associated<br/>&gt; with concepts of melody construction and internal pitch<br/>&gt; relationships that go well beyond any simple ordering of pitches<br/>&gt; from lowest to highest (see also Mode, Melody type). Even in<br/>&gt; Western tonal music, however, scales are only a reflection of<br/>&gt; compositional practice that includes notions of appropriate melodic<br/>&gt; progression and the functions of individual pitches in relation to<br/>&gt; one another. With respect to nontonal Western music, a scale is<br/>&gt; likely to be simply an arbitrary represantation of pitch content<br/>&gt; that contributes little to an understanding of a given work.</p><p>Note how this definition encompasses scale as an active (&quot;concepts of<br/>melody construction&quot;) and passive (&quot;reflection of compositional<br/>practice&quot;) principle. For the active principle, you are referred to<br/>&quot;mode&quot;. For the rest, the similarities to a mode are stressed, or it<br/>is &quot;an arbitrary representation of pitch content that contributes<br/>little to an understanding of a given work.&quot;</p><p>&gt;<br/>&gt; ...<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; The rest of the definition tells us how the total pitch world of<br/>&gt; Western tonal music is consigned to 12 pitch-classes, how a scale<br/>&gt; out of these 12 pitches can be made to choose any one of the 12<br/>&gt; tones as its starting point, how repetitions through any number of<br/>&gt; octaves may occur, how the diatonic scale is central to the idea of<br/>&gt; tonal music, how any of the seven pitches of such a scale can be<br/>&gt; taken as the starting point for rearranging the order of tones and<br/>&gt; semitones (thus resulting in what is called the &grave;octave species&grave; or<br/>&gt; &grave;modes&grave;), how all but one of these (starting with B) have been<br/>&gt; recognized in both theory and practice, thus, forming part of the<br/>&gt; system of modes, and how only two of these have gained prominence.</p><p>This is Glarean&apos;s extension of the church modes. Notice the concluding<br/>idea (which refers to &quot;Ionian&quot; and &quot;Aeolian&quot;): musical Darwinism at<br/>its best. I don&apos;t think any of us wants that.</p><p>&gt;<br/>&gt; Moreover, there is hardly any distinction when it is said: &quot;The<br/>&gt; major mode or major scale takes the pattern produced by starting<br/>&gt; upward through the diatonic scale from C.&quot; except for the fact that<br/>&gt; the minor scale or mode is distinguished in regards to its<br/>&gt; &quot;starting point&quot; and &quot;hierarchical relationship (functions) of<br/>&gt; pitches&quot;.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Obviously, the &quot;major mode&quot; is made synonymous here with &quot;major<br/>&gt; scale&quot; just as it is the case with its minor counterpart.</p><p>Probably a reflection of what people call things. In the text, major<br/>and minor were introduced in the context of Glarean&apos;s modes as modes<br/>themselves (if only in the sense of octave species/placement of the<br/>semitones), but music students today are taught to call them scales.</p><p>&gt;<br/>&gt; To add insult to injury, let me confess that I&apos;m so confused now<br/>&gt; that nothing makes sense anymore.</p><p>It&apos;s not you, it&apos;s the state of the world.</p><p>&gt;<br/>&gt; Here comes the greatest sentence: &quot;A composition based PRIMARILY on<br/>&gt; a given scale is said to be the KEY of that scale.&quot;</p><p>But they left out here that &quot;a given scale&quot; is (in our terminology)<br/>the result of a mode transposed to a specific pitch height.</p><p>&gt;<br/>&gt; This refutes the argument that maqams are modes, since everyone<br/>&gt; knows that a maqam is &quot;a scale or several scales upon which a<br/>&gt; composition is PRIMARILY based upon&quot;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; The above-given definition of &quot;maqam&quot; is based on the premise that:<br/>&gt; &quot;scales are simply abstractions from musical practice rather than<br/>&gt; musical objects with prior or independent standing.&quot; and that modes<br/>&gt; are &quot;any of a series of loosely related concepts employed in the<br/>&gt; study and classification of both scales and melodies&quot;.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &quot;Loosely related&quot; is certainly not the proper term to brand maqams<br/>&gt; with. On the contrary, maqams are &quot;very elaborately woven&quot; with<br/>&gt; many many functions assigned to the pitches that aid in the melodic<br/>&gt; flow of music.</p><p>Take statements like &quot;You play this rag fast&quot;, &quot;There is no seventh<br/>degree&quot;, &quot;Introduce this note last&quot;, &quot;Place a melisma here, here, and<br/>there&quot;, &quot;Always jump to this note from that other one, unless ...&quot; Are<br/>they related? Can a good singer avoid to weave them together?</p><p>&gt;<br/>&gt; To make the distinction better, here is continuation of the<br/>&gt; definition of mode from the same source:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &quot;The term (mode) is oftern restricted to scale types defined as<br/>&gt; collections of pitches arranged from lowest to highest, each<br/>&gt; including one pitch that is regarded as central. At another<br/>&gt; extreme, some concepts of mode emphasize melody types; any given<br/>&gt; mode is defined principally by characteristic melodic elements.<br/>&gt; Other concepts of mode range between these extremes. No single<br/>&gt; concept usefully embraces all that has been meant by the term<br/>&gt; throughout the the history of Western music as well as all that is<br/>&gt; meant by the terms associated with non-Western music that have at<br/>&gt; one time or another been translated as mode.&quot;</p><p>Our main &quot;innovation&quot; is the resolution to call rotations of scales<br/>rotations, not modes. Our modes make melodies from the &quot;recognized&quot;<br/>notes of the gamut (the second definition above); operations on the<br/>resluting scales are called something else.</p><p>&gt;<br/>&gt; It is clear, that had non-Westerners knew of the wonderfully<br/>&gt; adequate term called &quot;key&quot; as a translation of &quot;maqam/destgah/rag&quot;,<br/>&gt; they would never have attempted to stretch the definition of mode<br/>&gt; to what it has become today.</p><p>I&apos;m not sure if you are being sarcastic or if I know that little about<br/>maqams. A western key is a specific transposition of a scale; when a<br/>march modulates to the subdominant for the trio, both parts may be in<br/>major, but one is in C major and the other in F major, and both have<br/>the same internal interval structure. In maqam, I thought, you tune to<br/>the singer, don&apos;t modulate (=transpose the same mode to another pitch)<br/>and have rules how to build your melody which a key doesn&apos;t have.</p><p>[...]</p><p>&gt;<br/>&gt; [OZ] Does this mean that hundreds of Scala files need to be rid of<br/>&gt; the word scale, and replaced with gamut?</p><p>With some of them, like 12-ET, it makes sense. Most are really scales,<br/>and we are given no information which mode brought them about. If<br/>anything is called mode, it is probably a rotation of a scale.</p><p>[...]</p><p>Our central concept is the mode/rag/maqam. Its rules extract pitches<br/>from the gamut, and the result is a scale, or several scales used in<br/>different contexts. The notes of the scale can be rotated.</p><p>klaus</p></div><h3><a id=58855 href="#58855">ðŸ”—</a>Dave Keenan &#x3C;d.keenan@bigpond.net.au&#x3E;</h3><span>6/2/2005 8:41:17 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;Yahya Abdal-Aziz&quot; &lt;yahya@m...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt; And even those things I thought I understood<br/>&gt; the &quot;tuning-list orthodoxy&quot; on, I may have misjudged based<br/>&gt; purely on who&apos;s been vocal recently ...

But your collection of<br/>  definitions below shows the state of affairs: so many terms and<br/>  definitions that can mean identical or different things. We were just<br/>  trying to extract a subset from them that expressed what might be<br/>  necessary in a few distinct terms.</p><p>  I don&apos;t remember who introduced the term &quot;gamut&quot; in this discussion<br/>  and which meaning was intended. It was probably somewhere in the<br/>  middle between your understanding, coming from French where gamme _is_<br/>  a scale plain and simple, and my German, where no cognate of &quot;gamut&quot;<br/>  exists, so that I naturally went back to the original meaning. And I<br/>  joined the discussion when I felt that the full potential of &quot;gamut&quot;<br/>  was being ignored.</p><p>  &gt; As for the gamut wars, I rest my case. Nevertheless, I wonder why<br/>  &gt; we allow this word to be overloaded when &grave;compass&grave; or &grave;range&grave; would<br/>  &gt; do nicely in its stead to define the extent of pitches afforded by<br/>  &gt; an instrument.</p><p>  Well, the word is overloaded in English. It can mean scale, it can<br/>  mean compass, but it also can mean the totality of &quot;recognized&quot;<br/>  pitches (according to the New Shorter Oxford). This was the original<br/>  meaning.</p><p>  [French gamme, English scale: two catchall terms]</p><p>  &gt; *<br/>  &gt;<br/>  &gt; The best definition of &grave;scale&grave; is perhaps that of the Harvard<br/>  &gt; Dictionary of Music 4th Edition:<br/>  &gt;<br/>  &gt; Scale (Fr. gamme, &eacute;chelle; Ger. Tonleiter, Skala; It. scala, gamma;<br/>  &gt; Sp. escala gamma) A collection of pitches arranged in order from<br/>  &gt; lowest to highest or from highest to lowest. The pitches of any<br/>  &gt; music in which pitch is definable can be reduced to a scale. The<br/>  &gt; concept and its pedagogical use have been especially prominent in<br/>  &gt; the history of Western are music. The importance of the concept in<br/>  &gt; non-Western systems varies considerably and is often associated<br/>  &gt; with concepts of melody construction and internal pitch<br/>  &gt; relationships that go well beyond any simple ordering of pitches<br/>  &gt; from lowest to highest (see also Mode, Melody type). Even in<br/>  &gt; Western tonal music, however, scales are only a reflection of<br/>  &gt; compositional practice that includes notions of appropriate melodic<br/>  &gt; progression and the functions of individual pitches in relation to<br/>  &gt; one another. With respect to nontonal Western music, a scale is<br/>  &gt; likely to be simply an arbitrary represantation of pitch content<br/>  &gt; that contributes little to an understanding of a given work.</p><p>  Note how this definition encompasses scale as an active (&quot;concepts of<br/>  melody construction&quot;) and passive (&quot;reflection of compositional<br/>  practice&quot;) principle. For the active principle, you are referred to<br/>  &quot;mode&quot;. For the rest, the similarities to a mode are stressed, or it<br/>  is &quot;an arbitrary representation of pitch content that contributes<br/>  little to an understanding of a given work.&quot;</p><p>  &gt;<br/>  &gt; ...<br/>  &gt;<br/>  &gt; The rest of the definition tells us how the total pitch world of<br/>  &gt; Western tonal music is consigned to 12 pitch-classes, how a scale<br/>  &gt; out of these 12 pitches can be made to choose any one of the 12<br/>  &gt; tones as its starting point, how repetitions through any number of<br/>  &gt; octaves may occur, how the diatonic scale is central to the idea of<br/>  &gt; tonal music, how any of the seven pitches of such a scale can be<br/>  &gt; taken as the starting point for rearranging the order of tones and<br/>  &gt; semitones (thus resulting in what is called the &grave;octave species&grave; or<br/>  &gt; &grave;modes&grave;), how all but one of these (starting with B) have been<br/>  &gt; recognized in both theory and practice, thus, forming part of the<br/>  &gt; system of modes, and how only two of these have gained prominence.</p><p>  This is Glarean&apos;s extension of the church modes. Notice the concluding<br/>  idea (which refers to &quot;Ionian&quot; and &quot;Aeolian&quot;): musical Darwinism at<br/>  its best. I don&apos;t think any of us wants that.</p><p>  &gt;<br/>  &gt; Moreover, there is hardly any distinction when it is said: &quot;The<br/>  &gt; major mode or major scale takes the pattern produced by starting<br/>  &gt; upward through the diatonic scale from C.&quot; except for the fact that<br/>  &gt; the minor scale or mode is distinguished in regards to its<br/>  &gt; &quot;starting point&quot; and &quot;hierarchical relationship (functions) of<br/>  &gt; pitches&quot;.<br/>  &gt;<br/>  &gt; Obviously, the &quot;major mode&quot; is made synonymous here with &quot;major<br/>  &gt; scale&quot; just as it is the case with its minor counterpart.</p><p>  Probably a reflection of what people call things. In the text, major<br/>  and minor were introduced in the context of Glarean&apos;s modes as modes<br/>  themselves (if only in the sense of octave species/placement of the<br/>  semitones), but music students today are taught to call them scales.</p><p>  &gt;<br/>  &gt; To add insult to injury, let me confess that I&apos;m so confused now<br/>  &gt; that nothing makes sense anymore.</p><p>  It&apos;s not you, it&apos;s the state of the world.</p><p>  &gt;<br/>  &gt; Here comes the greatest sentence: &quot;A composition based PRIMARILY on<br/>  &gt; a given scale is said to be the KEY of that scale.&quot;</p><p>  But they left out here that &quot;a given scale&quot; is (in our terminology)<br/>  the result of a mode transposed to a specific pitch height.</p><p>  &gt;<br/>  &gt; This refutes the argument that maqams are modes, since everyone<br/>  &gt; knows that a maqam is &quot;a scale or several scales upon which a<br/>  &gt; composition is PRIMARILY based upon&quot;<br/>  &gt;<br/>  &gt; The above-given definition of &quot;maqam&quot; is based on the premise that:<br/>  &gt; &quot;scales are simply abstractions from musical practice rather than<br/>  &gt; musical objects with prior or independent standing.&quot; and that modes<br/>  &gt; are &quot;any of a series of loosely related concepts employed in the<br/>  &gt; study and classification of both scales and melodies&quot;.<br/>  &gt;<br/>  &gt; &quot;Loosely related&quot; is certainly not the proper term to brand maqams<br/>  &gt; with. On the contrary, maqams are &quot;very elaborately woven&quot; with<br/>  &gt; many many functions assigned to the pitches that aid in the melodic<br/>  &gt; flow of music.</p><p>  Take statements like &quot;You play this rag fast&quot;, &quot;There is no seventh<br/>  degree&quot;, &quot;Introduce this note last&quot;, &quot;Place a melisma here, here, and<br/>  there&quot;, &quot;Always jump to this note from that other one, unless ...&quot; Are<br/>  they related? Can a good singer avoid to weave them together?</p><p>  &gt;<br/>  &gt; To make the distinction better, here is continuation of the<br/>  &gt; definition of mode from the same source:<br/>  &gt;<br/>  &gt; &quot;The term (mode) is oftern restricted to scale types defined as<br/>  &gt; collections of pitches arranged from lowest to highest, each<br/>  &gt; including one pitch that is regarded as central. At another<br/>  &gt; extreme, some concepts of mode emphasize melody types; any given<br/>  &gt; mode is defined principally by characteristic melodic elements.<br/>  &gt; Other concepts of mode range between these extremes. No single<br/>  &gt; concept usefully embraces all that has been meant by the term<br/>  &gt; throughout the the history of Western music as well as all that is<br/>  &gt; meant by the terms associated with non-Western music that have at<br/>  &gt; one time or another been translated as mode.&quot;</p><p>  Our main &quot;innovation&quot; is the resolution to call rotations of scales<br/>  rotations, not modes. Our modes make melodies from the &quot;recognized&quot;<br/>  notes of the gamut (the second definition above); operations on the<br/>  resluting scales are called something else.</p><p>  &gt;<br/>  &gt; It is clear, that had non-Westerners knew of the wonderfully<br/>  &gt; adequate term called &quot;key&quot; as a translation of &quot;maqam/destgah/rag&quot;,<br/>  &gt; they would never have attempted to stretch the definition of mode<br/>  &gt; to what it has become today.</p><p>  I&apos;m not sure if you are being sarcastic or if I know that little about<br/>  maqams. A western key is a specific transposition of a scale; when a<br/>  march modulates to the subdominant for the trio, both parts may be in<br/>  major, but one is in C major and the other in F major, and both have<br/>  the same internal interval structure. In maqam, I thought, you tune to<br/>  the singer, don&apos;t modulate (=transpose the same mode to another pitch)<br/>  and have rules how to build your melody which a key doesn&apos;t have.</p><p>  [...]</p><p>  &gt;<br/>  &gt; [OZ] Does this mean that hundreds of Scala files need to be rid of<br/>  &gt; the word scale, and replaced with gamut?</p><p>  With some of them, like 12-ET, it makes sense. Most are really scales,<br/>  and we are given no information which mode brought them about. If<br/>  anything is called mode, it is probably a rotation of a scale.</p><p>  [...]</p><p>  Our central concept is the mode/rag/maqam. Its rules extract pitches<br/>  from the gamut, and the result is a scale, or several scales used in<br/>  different contexts. The notes of the scale can be rotated.</p><p>  klaus</p></div><h3><a id=58907 href="#58907">ðŸ”—</a>klaus schmirler &#x3C;KSchmir@online.de&#x3E;</h3><span>6/5/2005 5:24:30 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Ozan Yarman wrote:<br/>&gt; Dear Klaus,</p><p>Hi Ozan,</p><p>&gt; &gt; At last, you would agree that my perception is equally valid amidst<br/>&gt;  all this chaos?</p><p>I recognize that all these terms are in use, meaning more often than<br/>not the same thing, and I try to take that into account.

Medieval modes in Pythagorean tuning<br/>  &gt;<br/>  &gt; The term &quot;mode&quot; can have many meanings, but here is used simply to<br/>  &gt; mean a scale or octave-species with a characteristic pattern of<br/>  &gt; whole-steps and semitones. For theorists such as Johannes de<br/>  &gt; Grocheio (c. 1300), the term could imply further a regular formula<br/>  &gt; by which one may know the beginning, middle, and end of a melody -<br/>  &gt; as in Gregorian chant with its reciting tones, as opposed to the<br/>  &gt; world of polyphony and secular music. Thus Grocheio prefers to say<br/>  &gt; that polyphonic music is based on various octave-species, but not<br/>  &gt; on &quot;modes&quot; proper.</p><p>  Polyphonic music was not in octaves only, so the melodies of other<br/>  voices than the tenor couldn&apos;t adhere to the &quot;mode&quot; in its rich sense.<br/>  Reason for Grocheo to come up with a different term.</p><p>  &gt;<br/>  &gt; As regards the &quot;unrelatedness quotient&quot; of melody types which<br/>  &gt; according to you can be taken as modes, I disagree entirely that<br/>  &gt; directions passed down from master to pupil can be taken for<br/>  &gt; granted and the underlying pattern ignored when<br/>  &gt; constructing/performing maqams/rags/destgahs.</p><p>  I didn&apos;t say that, and I was insinuating that the author of the<br/>  article didn&apos;t mean that either. I have no way of looking into his<br/>  head, but I think he meant to say that there is no relation between a<br/>  rag emphasizing a note and it being a morning rag, except in a<br/>  specific culture. And that there is no requirement for modes in other<br/>  cultures to have a corresponding set of criteria.</p><p>    The connections, at<br/>  &gt; least for maqams, are not &quot;loose&quot; in any sense of the word.<br/>  &gt; Functions that correspond to Western keys are implemented to all<br/>  &gt; the degrees of maqam scales, allowing a complete sweep of the<br/>  &gt; entire tonal spectrum in Maqam Music.</p><p>  I don&apos;t understand this. To use the precise terminology, keys in<br/>  Western music can be transposed to every note of the gamut, not only<br/>  some scale. Can you give an Arabic of Turkish term for &quot;key&quot;?</p><p>    In fact, you are encouraged<br/>  &gt; to a complete tour in Maqam City.

The<br/>gamut can provide for an unequal distribution of the tones of for an<br/>equal one like 24-et, which allows free and exact transposition. Or<br/>you can have both, as in 53-et (How did 17-et fit into the picture?).<br/>Or you can have an open system like JI that expands in the direction<br/>your music wants to go (instruments permitting). And if you write for<br/>an orchestra, you probably want a different gamut that is not<br/>restricted to 2 octaves.</p><p>The mode sets the interval relations, final tone, mood, &amp;c. Depending<br/>on the contextual rules it provides, it selects one or more scales<br/>from the gamut. (Actually it probably selects tones for a melody that<br/>you can afterward arrange as a scale.) I mention two scales below that<br/>look like F major. Since they are different modes, I assume that they<br/>have different melodic rules; one may have the final on its upper F,<br/>the other on the lower. And of course, if you refer to a specific<br/>modal system like maqam, nobody wants to keep you from using that<br/>specific term.</p><p>&gt;<br/>&gt; So, I may not be inclined to your usage of the word &quot;mode&quot;.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Also, I am not at all inclined to use &quot;modulation&quot; synonymously with<br/>&gt; &quot;transposition&quot;, although chromatic modulation and transposition intersect<br/>&gt; in both meaning and function.</p><p>I would say transposition is a restatement of a scale or melody on a<br/>different degree of the gamut. This corresponds to &quot;chromatic<br/>transposition&quot; in Western theory. A sequence in the modern sense is a<br/>diatonic transposition that sticks to the notes of the scale, cycling<br/>the motiv through different rotations of that scale.</p><p>&quot;Modulation&quot; is the procedure of going from one mode to another or a<br/>different transposition of the same. So in the object oriented<br/>paradigm, modulation, just like modes, is a method, not an object (Yahya?).</p><p> Especially since scales are generally subsets<br/>&gt; of larger systems that you want to call gamuts, I object strongly to<br/>&gt; the idea of &quot;modulating within the gamut&quot;. How about &quot;transposing through<br/>&gt; the degrees of a gamut&quot; instead?</p><p>But the additional flat in the trio of a menuet or march was not part<br/>of the scale before. It comes from the gamut. If you have unequal<br/>steps between the 48 notes and transpose, you need new notes to keep the correct step sizes. They come from a gamut like 53-et.</p><p>&gt;<br/>&gt; Now, in order to understand Maqamat, one needs to consider the tonal music<br/>&gt; of Europe, where modulations and transpositions of keys take place. Even in<br/>&gt; a limited form such as I VI V, the tonal music differs from modes of the<br/>&gt; Middle Ages. Perhaps it is the transition period from modality to tonality<br/>&gt; that encourages you to adopt a more tonal perspective when scrutinizing<br/>&gt; modality.</p><p>I don&apos;t think I do.</p><p>&gt;<br/>&gt; Anyway, the maqams not only modulate within the same diatonical scale, but<br/>&gt; they also may transpose within the gamut. So, key seems to embrace the<br/>&gt; concept pretty well.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Wherever did you get the idea for Rast Yegah? Maybe you can elaborate what<br/>&gt; you mean?</p><p>As for the part comparing it with harmonic minor, I simply didn&apos;t see<br/>the slashes through the accidentals. As for its nontransposibility, as<br/>far as I know Yakah is tuned to the lowest note in the range of the<br/>singer. (My source is Habib Hassan Touma in a book on Arab music -<br/>assuming that most of the classical heritage is Osmanic; it&apos;s the most<br/>pertinent book I have access to - and a couple of essays by Frangis<br/>Alizade that I read long ago). This would mean it is fixed in space<br/>(at the low end of the gamut). Touma doesn&apos;t give the maqamat all on<br/>the same note, which I would have expected if they are totally<br/>transposable (you could see the differences easier by just looking at<br/>accidentals). Instead, they start for the most part from G, C, and D,<br/>half flat E seems common, some are on A. Furthermore, in the &apos;agam<br/>group he gives a couple of major scales (I&apos;ve looked hard for slashes<br/>this time). Each transposition has its own name, including the ones on<br/>low F (lower than yagah=G) and high F (s&shy;ah war and gaharkah/mazmum<br/>respectively). So a maqam seems to imply not only a sequence of<br/>intervals, but also a position in the two octave gamut. Maybe Arabian<br/>and Turkish music diverge in that respect. (But again, Alizade, from<br/>north of Turkey, gave me the same ideas.)</p><p>&gt;<br/>&gt; Also, if you have been following the recent discussions about 79 MOS out of<br/>&gt; 159tET, perhaps you can suggest an approach that will clear the mess.</p><p>I can&apos;t, although I&apos;m reading along. If others have the same problems<br/>I have, it may help if you state again what you are after, focussing<br/>on the necessary notes instead of the notation. In traditional<br/>notation, you have 24 notes per octave, like the Arabian system. If I<br/>remember correctly, you need semitones, whole tones, 1 1/2 tones, and<br/>pythagorean and just thirds. And it should be an et. Why does it need<br/>to be a meantone system?</p><p>klaus</p></div><h3><a id=59135 href="#59135">ðŸ”—</a>Ozan Yarman &#x3C;ozanyarman@superonline.com&#x3E;</h3><span>6/14/2005 2:38:13 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Dear Klaus,</p><p>I am not against restricting terms or their usage. In fact, proper<br/>methodology requires it, unless we are not indulging in poetry or sophism.<br/>Yet, I have made my objections from the point of view that Maqams should not<br/>be consigned to the term &quot;mode&quot; even when this is expanded to embrace them.<br/>It is simply not proper to insinuate that Greek-Christian theories have<br/>similar bearings to Maqam Music. My rejection of the term is due to a<br/>cultural issue alone.</p><p>Now, let us conclude then, that transposition is moving the tonic of a scale<br/>to another degree of the gamut while preserving step sizes, while modulation<br/>is rotating the scale itself. Modulation does not and cannot be forced to<br/>mean the preservation of the correct step sizes of a scale.

But know that<br/>neither 24, nor 53 can suffice to explain the perde-system due to the nature<br/>of the Ney that gives JI ratios close to that of Zarlino&apos;s diatonical scale<br/>for Rast, the fundamental maqam and the first degree of the Ney at the same<br/>time.</p><p>17ET?

The distinctions that are most important above all are<br/>between those of segah-buselik and evdj-mahur.</p><p>Maqam Music should have the range of a piano, while the gamut of the perdes<br/>can be transposed to the octave region according to the instrument chosen.</p><p>For example, each Ney has a different compass compared to the standart<br/>diapason. Their registers are transposed even when their notation must<br/>remain the same. That is because they are Transposing instruments like the<br/>Clarinets or Trumpets.</p><p>Let me demonstrate. Sipurde Ney gives the following pitches for Rast<br/>according to the international diapason:</p><p>CDEFGABC</p><p>However, third and seventh degrees can be flattened a notch depending on the<br/>seyir of the maqam. Besides, in order to achieve the correct pitches (1 9/8<br/>5/4 4/3 3/2 5/3 15/8 2), you need a meantone notation by default.</p><p>Barring the flattening nuances, you can express this maqam on the staff as:</p><p>Do-Re-Mi-Fa-Sol-La-Si-Do (principal major scale)</p><p>Where Do is around C4=260hz. Sipurde is the only Ney that can play in<br/>concord with a symphony orchestra using this notation.</p><p>For other Neys, the same written notation results in the transposition of<br/>the diapason itself. For example:</p><p>Mansur notation for Rast Maqam: Do-Re-Mi-Fa-Sol-La-Si-Do<br/>Pitches heard: GABCDEF#G</p><p>Thus, the gamut of the perdes depends on the register of the instrument as<br/>well as where you want to transpose them.</p><p>I hope this clears the misconception regarding perdes. Many think that they<br/>correspond to frequencies, whereas they correspond only to flexible<br/>step-sizes.</p><p>Cordially,<br/>Ozan</p><p>----- Original Message -----<br/>From: &quot;klaus schmirler&quot; &lt;<a href="mailto:KSchmir@online.de">KSchmir@online.de</a>&gt;<br/>To: &lt;<a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>&gt;<br/>Sent: 11 Haziran 2005 Cumartesi 23:50<br/>Subject: Re: [tuning] Re: Scales: an lengthy attempt at proper definition</p><p>Ozan Yarman wrote:<br/>&gt; &apos;tis a late reply, but here goes.</p><p>And I promised to comment on the part I snipped a couple of days ago.<br/>I can now say that I didn&apos;t find any of your terms except rast, but I<br/>should have understood just by looking at their setup that they were<br/>note names.</p><p>&gt;<br/>&gt; When tuning definitions are concerned, is it just tea for two? Differences<br/>&gt; of opinion lead to different directions, and hence, the foundation of<br/>&gt; different schools of thought. This has been experienced once too often,<br/>with<br/>&gt; quite regrettable results I might add. I think the tuning list should<br/>avoid<br/>&gt; such segragations/secterianism whenever possible, even if it means<br/>complete<br/>&gt; unresolution in most cases.</p><p>I repeat, we didn&apos;t change anything except restricting the uses of<br/>&quot;mode&quot; and &quot;scale&quot;. Neither Yahya nor I introduced any new terms, and<br/>what we drew attention to (&quot;gamut&quot; for a whole tonal system,<br/>&quot;rotation&quot; for the &quot;jazz modes&quot;) has all been in use before. &quot;Key&quot; or<br/>&quot;genus&quot; might well have found a place in that terminology, but since<br/>nobody else participated ...</p><p>&gt;<br/>&gt; I am, as can be expected, still confused with your usage of the terms, and<br/>&gt; am having difficulties drawing parallels to the world of maqams.</p><p>Your gamut can be the classical 24 tones in 2 octaves (according to my<br/>Arab-oriented source, that would be from yakah to ramal tuti). The<br/>gamut can provide for an unequal distribution of the tones of for an<br/>equal one like 24-et, which allows free and exact transposition. Or<br/>you can have both, as in 53-et (How did 17-et fit into the picture?).<br/>Or you can have an open system like JI that expands in the direction<br/>your music wants to go (instruments permitting). And if you write for<br/>an orchestra, you probably want a different gamut that is not<br/>restricted to 2 octaves.</p><p>The mode sets the interval relations, final tone, mood, &amp;c. Depending<br/>on the contextual rules it provides, it selects one or more scales<br/>from the gamut. (Actually it probably selects tones for a melody that<br/>you can afterward arrange as a scale.) I mention two scales below that<br/>look like F major. Since they are different modes, I assume that they<br/>have different melodic rules; one may have the final on its upper F,<br/>the other on the lower. And of course, if you refer to a specific<br/>modal system like maqam, nobody wants to keep you from using that<br/>specific term.</p><p>&gt;<br/>&gt; So, I may not be inclined to your usage of the word &quot;mode&quot;.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Also, I am not at all inclined to use &quot;modulation&quot; synonymously with<br/>&gt; &quot;transposition&quot;, although chromatic modulation and transposition intersect<br/>&gt; in both meaning and function.</p><p>I would say transposition is a restatement of a scale or melody on a<br/>different degree of the gamut. This corresponds to &quot;chromatic<br/>transposition&quot; in Western theory. A sequence in the modern sense is a<br/>diatonic transposition that sticks to the notes of the scale, cycling<br/>the motiv through different rotations of that scale.</p><p>&quot;Modulation&quot; is the procedure of going from one mode to another or a<br/>different transposition of the same. So in the object oriented<br/>paradigm, modulation, just like modes, is a method, not an object<br/>(Yahya?).</p><p>  Especially since scales are generally subsets<br/>&gt; of larger systems that you want to call gamuts, I object strongly to<br/>&gt; the idea of &quot;modulating within the gamut&quot;. How about &quot;transposing through<br/>&gt; the degrees of a gamut&quot; instead?</p><p>But the additional flat in the trio of a menuet or march was not part<br/>of the scale before. It comes from the gamut. If you have unequal<br/>steps between the 48 notes and transpose, you need new notes to keep<br/>the correct step sizes. They come from a gamut like 53-et.</p><p>&gt;<br/>&gt; Now, in order to understand Maqamat, one needs to consider the tonal music<br/>&gt; of Europe, where modulations and transpositions of keys take place. Even<br/>in<br/>&gt; a limited form such as I VI V, the tonal music differs from modes of the<br/>&gt; Middle Ages. Perhaps it is the transition period from modality to tonality<br/>&gt; that encourages you to adopt a more tonal perspective when scrutinizing<br/>&gt; modality.</p><p>I don&apos;t think I do.</p><p>&gt;<br/>&gt; Anyway, the maqams not only modulate within the same diatonical scale, but<br/>&gt; they also may transpose within the gamut. So, key seems to embrace the<br/>&gt; concept pretty well.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Wherever did you get the idea for Rast Yegah? Maybe you can elaborate what<br/>&gt; you mean?</p><p>As for the part comparing it with harmonic minor, I simply didn&apos;t see<br/>the slashes through the accidentals. As for its nontransposibility, as<br/>far as I know Yakah is tuned to the lowest note in the range of the<br/>singer. (My source is Habib Hassan Touma in a book on Arab music -<br/>assuming that most of the classical heritage is Osmanic; it&apos;s the most<br/>pertinent book I have access to - and a couple of essays by Frangis<br/>Alizade that I read long ago). This would mean it is fixed in space<br/>(at the low end of the gamut). Touma doesn&apos;t give the maqamat all on<br/>the same note, which I would have expected if they are totally<br/>transposable (you could see the differences easier by just looking at<br/>accidentals). Instead, they start for the most part from G, C, and D,<br/>half flat E seems common, some are on A. Furthermore, in the &apos;agam<br/>group he gives a couple of major scales (I&apos;ve looked hard for slashes<br/>this time). Each transposition has its own name, including the ones on<br/>low F (lower than yagah=G) and high F (s&iuml;&iquest;&half;ah war and gaharkah/mazmum<br/>respectively). So a maqam seems to imply not only a sequence of<br/>intervals, but also a position in the two octave gamut. Maybe Arabian<br/>and Turkish music diverge in that respect. (But again, Alizade, from<br/>north of Turkey, gave me the same ideas.)</p><p>&gt;<br/>&gt; Also, if you have been following the recent discussions about 79 MOS out<br/>of<br/>&gt; 159tET, perhaps you can suggest an approach that will clear the mess.</p><p>I can&apos;t, although I&apos;m reading along. If others have the same problems<br/>I have, it may help if you state again what you are after, focussing<br/>on the necessary notes instead of the notation. In traditional<br/>notation, you have 24 notes per octave, like the Arabian system. If I<br/>remember correctly, you need semitones, whole tones, 1 1/2 tones, and<br/>pythagorean and just thirds. And it should be an et. Why does it need<br/>to be a meantone system?</p><p>klaus</p></div><h3><a id=59164 href="#59164">ðŸ”—</a>klaus schmirler &#x3C;KSchmir@online.de&#x3E;</h3><span>6/15/2005 3:11:11 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Ozan Yarman wrote:<br/>&gt; CDEFGABC<br/>&gt; &gt; to<br/>&gt; &gt; DEFGABCD<br/>&gt; &gt; is a modulation from Ionian to Dorian.
