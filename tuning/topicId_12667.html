That first horn<br/>descent (C#-b-A#-A,  in the context of the accompanying harmony of course)<br/>sounds so deliciously &quot;wrong&quot;, I get pretty much the same feeling<br/>from it that I do from Dan S&apos;s 3rd/4th &quot; . .beautiful . . &quot; in At a Day<br/>Job.  Compare it (msr 20) to the transformation of the phrase-let in msr<br/>21. (F-E-D-C)  Here, it sounds far more &quot;normal&quot; or &quot;palatable.&quot;     I<br/>guess I was saying that the fact that Mahler achieved that &quot;wrongness&quot; or<br/>&quot;xenharmonicness&quot; in msr 20, still within 12t-ET is what was amazing.</p><p>As for the big chord----well,  I&apos;m just a beginner at this tuning stuff,<br/>so I look forward to being dissed,  :)  ,   but,  I&apos;ve noticed in my<br/>experimentation so far that the things that sound the most striking,<br/>&quot;re-tuned,&quot; are usually the things that bore me in 12t-ET.  for obvious<br/>examples, the dominant 7th chord,  stacked 4th sets, (ie  &quot;027&quot; in set<br/>theory nomenclature), and even the diatonic scale.   for instance in the<br/>Mahler, something I&apos;d really like to hear &quot;re-tuned&quot; might be that<br/>unearthly quasi-cadential &quot;pre-dominant&quot; sequence at msrs. 265-7, near the<br/>end of the movement.</p><p>On the other hand, the sonorities that excite me in 12t-ET,  such as<br/>&quot;014589&quot; sets, and subsets,  the &quot;big chord&quot; of Mahler&apos;s,  or perhaps one<br/>of Morton Feldman&apos;s sexy piano sonorities;  I find that they&apos;re not really<br/>any more exciting, in fact often just plain weaker, when<br/>&quot;xenharmonicized.&quot;</p><p>Well, I still have a lot of exploration to do, and I&apos;ll probably shoot<br/>myself in a year for having written this, but, hey, maybe it&apos;ll get some<br/>heated discussion going.</p><p>there&apos;s never enough of that on this list. . . .</p><p>heh heh.</p><p>----sorry those of you who don&apos;t happen to have a Mahler 10 score.  If<br/>there&apos;s enough interest, I can put some excerpts, and maybe an mp3 or two,<br/>up. . . . .</p><p>***From:  Christopher Bailey******************</p><p><a href="http://music.columbia.edu/~chris">http://music.columbia.edu/~chris</a></p><p>**********************************************</p></div>
