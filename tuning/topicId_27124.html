That gives us, with quartercomma shifts, precise<br/>vertical JI; thus my 62-note system is based on 1/4-comma.</p><p>Colonna, who&apos;s concerned (at least in his treatise) with tuning his<br/>instrument in a circulating system of 31 fifthtones, but not with<br/>Vicentino-style adaptive JI for this instrument, says both that the<br/>tuning is based on common practice for the first 19 notes, and that<br/>each tone is neatly divided into five dieses, without any odd &quot;commas&quot;<br/>or other complications.</p><p>If we view 31-tET as the deliberate slight tempering of major thirds<br/>for perfect theoretical symmetry, then neither Vicentino nor Colonna<br/>specify 31-tET as opposed to 1/4-comma meantone, with the latter<br/>seeming especially to fit Vicentino&apos;s adaptive JI tuning.</p><p>With Colonna, while he doesn&apos;t specify 31-tET in this kind of<br/>definition (a deliberate tempering of each major third), one could<br/>take his assertion that each tone divides neatly into five dieses<br/>without any commas or complications as expressing an ideal conception<br/>precisely fitting the 31-tET model emerging, to my best knowledge,<br/>somewhat later in the 17th century.</p><p>The &quot;pragmatic&quot; argument of what either Colonna or Vicentino were<br/>_likely_ to have tuned might focus on the question of how likely one<br/>would be to take 1/4-comma as a practical guide in tuning by ear, or<br/>to make the kind of adjustments which &quot;31-tET,&quot; as opposed to<br/>1/4-comma, tends to imply.</p><p>Then, again, this also raises the question: how was 1/4-comma<br/>typically tuned in this era? Aaron (1523) describes a process of<br/>tuning the major third C-E as &quot;sonorous and just&quot; as possible, with<br/>the greatest possible &quot;utility,&quot; and then equally tempering the fifths<br/>C-G-D-A-E -- as you&apos;ve described, Bob, in recent threads.</p><p>However, Aaron then describes a process of tempering the other fifths<br/>without expressly mentioning the possibility of simply tuning the rest<br/>of the gamut in terms of pure major thirds. He does urge the tuner to<br/>listen for good thirds as well as appropriately tempered fifths.</p><p>Maybe looking at the writings of people like Zarlino or Salinas in<br/>terms of what they say about the practical tuning process would be<br/>interesting: Zarlino does comment in 1571 that 1/4-comma &quot;is not very<br/>difficult to do,&quot; with the pure major thirds likely playing some role<br/>in this conclusion.</p><p>Mainly, when discussing this question, especially as someone who leans<br/>toward 1/4-comma meantone as a choice for this music, I should<br/>emphasize that Vicentino doesn&apos;t actually say, &quot;My tuning systems are<br/>based on a regular chain of fifths with the major thirds pure.&quot; While<br/>I consider it a reasonable inference to draw from his adaptive JI<br/>system, some leading scholars (Maria Rika Maniates and Claude Palisca,<br/>for example), have taken 31-tET as the basis for the system.</p><p>Scala, the outstanding scale definition and analysis program by Manuel<br/>Op de Coul, also has files in the related archive of scales giving<br/>versions of Vicentino&apos;s tunings based on 31-tET (vicentino1.scl,<br/>vicentino2.scl).</p><p>I do feel a responsibility now and then to state this side of the<br/>question.</p><p>Now we come to the first systematic presentation of 31-tET of which I<br/>am aware, by Lemme Rossi (1666), which specifically presents this<br/>equal division as the tuning of Vicentino&apos;s archicembalo, and gives<br/>string ratios accurate to about a tenth of a cent. He also describes<br/>1/4-comma meantone, calling it a _systema participata_, the term<br/>_participatio_ for a temperament, i.e. the slight narrowing of the<br/>fifths, going back to Gaffurius (1496).</p><p>It was Christiaan Huygens, near the end of this same century, who<br/>compared 1/4-comma meantone and 31-tET, defining the latter<br/>mathematically and noting the very small difference in the tempering<br/>of the fifth, suggesting that the very slightly smaller impurity in<br/>the fifth was an advantage of 31-tET.</p><p>Anyway, please feel free to ask more about this sometimes rather<br/>intricate question, and thanks for giving me some ideas, to say the<br/>least.</p><p>Most appreciatively,</p><p>Margo Schulter<br/><a href="mailto:mschulter@value.net">mschulter@value.net</a></p></div>
