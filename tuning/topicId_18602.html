Are you selecting and changing the<br/>contents of a cell?   Which version do you mean by &quot;previous&quot; (I&apos;m thinking<br/>you mean the version that didn&apos;t generate MIDI messages).  Which version of<br/>Excel are you using?  Which OS?  Does it happen every time or only some of<br/>the time?</p><p>thanks,<br/>Andy</p><p>I changed both generators manually (4 to 1, 6 to 3 from memory). I tried it<br/>in two versions, one before the 4th Feb, the later version after that date.<br/>I&apos;m using Excel 97 running under NT. The crash happens every time after I<br/>attempt to manually alter the generators, recovering only on exit and<br/>restart. I am fairly certain this didn&apos;t happen when I tried to change<br/>generators with the earlier version and unfortunately, when I downloaded<br/>the newer verison, I foolishly allowed it to overwrite the earlier version.<br/>Hope this answers the question.</p></div><h3><a id=18922 href="#18922">ðŸ”—</a>AMiltonF@aol.com</h3><span>2/18/2001 3:16:32 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>&gt;&gt;<br/>I changed both generators manually (4 to 1, 6 to 3 from memory).

The precise moment when it crashes is when<br/>the selected cell goes into edit mode thus making the cells contents<br/>unavailable for calculation (thus crashing).  This will happen when any cell<br/>in the entire workbook goes into edit mode, not just ones containing data.<br/>The easiest way to fix it is to just drop in sliders that control the<br/>generator&apos;s contents.  That will skip the cell&apos;s edit mode and not crash the<br/>app.  You&apos;ll still have to be careful not to put any cells into edit mode<br/>while the macro is running, but it should allow you to make the changes you<br/>want without stopping and restarting first.</p><p>Andy F.</p></div>
