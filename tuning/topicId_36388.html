In fact, I would only have to use &quot;sharps and flats&quot; and nothing<br/>more, since just one sharp and flat would give me 3x7 = 21!</p><p>However, part of the facility of Blackjack is the fact that it is<br/>*notated* of course, in 72-tET, and Pete&apos;s system wouldn&apos;t give me<br/>the consistency, since I would have &quot;sharps and flats&quot; in this system<br/>that would vary in cents value from note to note.  I suppose I could<br/>*delete* these symbols and just leave in the &quot;pitch bend&quot; but it&apos;s<br/>just as easy, quite frankly, to put in the *correct* Sims symbols and<br/>add the pitch bends manually... or so it seems at the moment.</p><p>Anyway, here is the readme file.  Anybody who has Sibelius and who<br/>wants to try his plug-in, which also comes with a nice example in a<br/>Sibelius file, should write to Pete:</p><p><a href="http://pete-at-pswalton.freeserve.co.uk">pete-at-pswalton.freeserve.co.uk</a></p><p>Graham Breed:  here is another English microtonalist that you might<br/>want to know about!</p><p>Anyway, here is and extract from the &quot;readme.&quot;  It&apos;s interesting or I<br/>wouldn&apos;t be posting it.

The plugin compares the<br/>notenames in the selection with those in the table, and, where they<br/>match, adds the relevant Midi pitchbend command.</p><p>2.&#x9;Monody</p><p>If you have any simultaneous notes in any staff in the selected<br/>passage, the plugin will mark them [X] NB the plugin does not<br/>recognise where there are two or more voices on a staff.<br/>You should separate voices and chords before you run the plugin.</p><p>3.&#x9;Channels</p><p>Since pitchbend commands apply to a Midi channel, you should make<br/>sure that all parts that you apply temperaments to are on separate<br/>channels.</p><p>4.&#x9;Non Scale notes</p><p>The plugin will mark any notes that are not defined in the table for<br/>the scale as [NS]</p><p>5.&#x9;restoring 12note Equal Temperament<br/>&#x9;<br/>At the beginning of the bar after the end of the selection, the<br/>plugin adds a midi command ~B 0,64<br/>This should  restore &apos;normal&apos; tuning.</p><p>6.&#x9;multiple temperaments</p><p>If you really want to, you could have different instruments playing<br/>in different temperaments, or even have the same instrument changing<br/>temperament during the course of your piece.</p><p>[HERE&apos;S THE MOST INTERESTING PART -- ED. OR RATHER JOE]:</p><p>NOTATIONAL CONVENTIONS FOR MICROTONAL MUSIC</p><p>----------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p>This is probably the most contentious issue re this plugin.<br/>I welcome your comments on this issue.</p><p>The books and articles I have read use many different forms of<br/>notation for microtonal music including  a variety of  signs, arrows,<br/>symbols, ratios etc.. As far as I am aware, there is no single<br/>convention for the notation of microtonal music, or to<br/>be more accurate, there are several conventions in existence.</p><p>The notation I have used is a compromise which is necessary  due to<br/>the current limitations of the Manuscript language. The range of<br/>accidentals consists therefore of those accidentals which are easily<br/>recognisable by Manuscript: double-flat, 3/4tone-flat, flat, 1/4tone-<br/>flat, natural,1/4tone-sharp, sharp,3/4tone-sharp,double-sharp.</p><p>The practice I have followed has generally been as follows (though<br/>there are probably a few exceptions):</p><p>no of notes in scale&#x9;&#x9;&#x9;</p><p>signs&#x9;                comments</p><p>1-12&#x9;&#x9;&#x9;&#x9;&#x9;<br/>natural # b only&#x9;enharmonic equivalents have same tuning</p><p>13 - 21&#x9;&#x9;&#x9;natural # b only enharmonic equivalents may<br/>be tuned differently</p><p>21+&#x9;&#x9;       all</p><p>Where enharmonic equivalents are tuned differently, sharps are<br/>treated as higher than flats ie:<br/>D# is higher that Eb<br/>Dx is higher than E<br/>Ebb is lower than D<br/>&#x9;<br/>However, when I got to very large scales (eg the 63note scale) I<br/>abandoned the last point, and used the order Cbb,  C3/4flat, Cb,<br/>C1/4flat, C, C1/4sharp, C#, C3/4sharp, Cx then the same for D,E...etc</p><p>So far, I have started all scales on C.  Making the scales<br/>transposable is on the list (below) of possible future developments.<br/>&#x9;<br/>For now, if you want them to start on another pitch, you will have to<br/>edit the Method for the particular scale you want to change.</p><p>If you want to create your own convention, read the section on<br/>editing your own scales (below).</p><p>POSSIBLE FURTHER DEVELOPMENTS<br/>-------------------------------------------------</p><p>a)&#x9;Addition of more scales and temperaments;</p><p>In Sibelius 2 it is easy.<br/>If you do create more scales, please send me a copy.</p><p>In Sib 1.4, make a copy of the whole plugin and change the Scale...<br/>method.</p><p>b)&#x9;Making the scales transposable</p><p>I wrote the plugin on Sib 1.4 which did not provide support for<br/>arrays.(OK they were theoretically possible but it was very awkward)<br/>Since Sib 2 now makes arrays possible it should be possible to make<br/>themost of the scales transposable.</p><p>c)&#x9;Recognition of Symbols</p><p>At the moment the Manuscript language can not recognise and interpret<br/>symbols attached to notes. Hopefully a later version of Manuscript<br/>will be able to do this.</p><p>d)&#x9;Parsing text files</p><p>On a couple of occasions I have asked Sib to add to the Manuscript<br/>language the ability to parse text files. Their response was that it<br/>is something they intend to  add in a future version of Manuscript<br/>(though they didn&apos;t give any clue as to when that would be).</p><p>This will have lots of advantages eg I occasionally do algorithmic<br/>composition in java, but to  get the results into Sib I have to save<br/>them as a Midi file (Yuk), then read it into Sib.  With a text file I<br/>could pass lots more note information - dynamics, accentuation etc...</p><p>Similarly for microtonal usage it should be possible to adapt or<br/>rewrite the plugin to read and interpret Scala files, which would<br/>increase its capacity very greatly !</p><p>MICROTONAL PLUG-INS<br/>by Peter Walton</p><p> MICROTONAL PLUGINS<br/>---------------------------------</p><p>I have several microtonal plugins. At the time of writing (March<br/>2002) they include:</p><p>Temperaments<br/>TempAbsolute<br/>TempArabic<br/>TempAsia<br/>TempDetune<br/>TempEqual<br/>TempGamelan<br/>TempNon8ve<br/>TempRatio<br/>RandomDetune<br/>AdhocTemperament<br/>MicroOrnament</p><p>Temperaments<br/>-----------------</p><p>a sampler plugin containing 3 scales</p><p>TempAbsolute<br/>-----------------</p><p>This plugin basically allows you to set up temperaments which are<br/>defined by pitchclass and 8ve<br/>rather than just pitchclass. Thus you can set up eg a different cents-<br/>deviation for C4 and C5 .</p><p>TempArabic</p><p>--------------</p><p>several scales taken from an article by AJ Ellis and from Scala</p><p>TempAsia<br/>------------<br/>a few tunings from Burma, China, Japan, Thailand and India</p><p>TempDetune<br/>---------------</p><p>Detune uses the standard chromatic scale but sets all notes slightly<br/>out of tune.</p><p>Folk1-5 :  you should edit these to play eg folk or blues where you<br/>only want to<br/>alter the tuning of a couple of pitches. For example you may want to<br/>slightly alter Eb and Bb<br/>to get a neutral 3rd or natural 7th.</p><p>Since for the &apos;Folk&apos; scales only a couple of notes are being retuned,<br/>they do not mark non-scales notes as [NS]</p><p>TempEqual<br/>-------------</p><p>19noteET<br/>63noteET</p><p>TempGamelan<br/>-----------------</p><p>Two pelog and two slendro tunings</p><p>TempNon8ve</p><p>-----------------<br/>25th root of  5/1</p><p>15th root of  3/1</p><p>16th root of  3/1<br/>9th root  of  3/2</p><p>TempRatio<br/>-------------</p><p>Partch 43-note<br/>Just<br/>Werckmeister 3<br/>Pythagorean<br/>Fibonacci</p><p>RandomDetune<br/>-----------------</p><p>You are prompted to enter a maximum deviation in cents (up to 100).<br/>The plugin will detune each note separately in the selection by a<br/>random number of cents.<br/>The detune will be different for each note and will be between 0<br/>cents and +/- the maximum deviation you entered.<br/>This differs from theTempDetune inasmuch as, in this plugin repeated<br/>notes will be tuned differently from each other,<br/>whereas in TempDetune all notes of a given pitchclass will have the<br/>same pitchbend.</p><p>It is useful for where you have the same melody played by two<br/>instruments and want one of them<br/>to play slightly out of tune with the other. For this use a max<br/>deviation of ca 10 cents.</p><p>If you want your piece to sound like it is being played by someone<br/>with absolutely no sense of intonation<br/>you could set the deviation high (eg to about 50).  I  tried that<br/>once with a Bach fugue....</p><p>AdhocTemperament</p><p>------------------------</p><p>Use this if you want to try out a one-off temperament.</p><p>You are prompted to enter a deviation for each pitch-class.</p><p>MicroOrnament</p><p>--------------------</p><p>This one is still in development.<br/>It creates multiple pitchbend commands for a single note, in order to<br/>produce microtonal fluctuations<br/>of various kinds.</p></div><h3><a id=36393 href="#36393">ðŸ”—</a>Gail Freeman &#x3C;afre667836@yahoo.com&#x3E;</h3><span>4/14/2002 6:01:24 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Please unsubscribe me from the tuning list!</p><p>---------------------------------<br/>Do You Yahoo!?<br/>Yahoo!
