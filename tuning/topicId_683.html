I am delighted to learn Stimmung is a result of a visit to LY&amp;MZ as i<br/>always felt there was a connection. These names chanted in proper intonation<br/>can light the Kings Chamber if you get my Drift. I learned to overtone in the<br/>Mongolian Hoomi style by isolating certain &quot;magic names&quot;,and the Tibetan chant<br/>by listening to the Monks on tape so when I did finally visit Dream House I was<br/>able to key into LaMontes constellation rather rapidly. I must agree finally<br/>that when the sacred becomes secular it loses its potency as Stockhausen may<br/>have over the years. LY &amp;MZs chanting has a certain degree of Hinusthani<br/>element-were Sa Re Ga Ma Pa Dha Ni SA are thank god substituted for words like<br/>Avocados.Nevertheless I was just mentioning that it might be nice to hear the<br/>piece on CD as my copy has snaps and crakles.

Several of the singers on<br/>&gt; Stimmung moved into toning and overtoning as a result of that piece.<br/>&gt; Pat&lt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; The electronic studies are indeed sine wave pieces, but the technology<br/>&gt; available was just not good enough to get the timbres in phase.<br/>&gt; Fortunately, these pieces are precisely notated so that they may be<br/>&gt; realized new. If I remember correctly, Peter E&#xFFFD;tv&#xFFFD;s has done an arrangement<br/>&gt; of Studie II (for string orchestra?).<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I have never found it a coincidence that Stockhausen made _Stimmung_ after<br/>&gt; paying a visit to La Monte Young and Marian Zazeela&apos;s loft.  I think that<br/>&gt; the Stockhausen has dated very badly. The bad erotic poetry (composers<br/>&gt; really shouldn&apos;t write lyrics!) and proto-new age &apos;magic names&apos; just come<br/>&gt; across as silly, while the rhythmic and timbral tranformation techniques<br/>&gt; now seem both pedantic and lack potential for surprise. Young&apos;s aesthetic,<br/>&gt; on the other hand, avoids giving the superstructure the kind of<br/>&gt; explicitness that has dated _Stimmung_ so badly, and uses a rule-base to<br/>&gt; control the improvised realization of the work that is really more honest<br/>&gt; than the hidden compositional controls exerted by Stockhausen.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I included _Sternklang_ on my list instead of the closely-related<br/>&gt; _Stimmung_ because it is materially more interesting (the diamond tonality<br/>&gt; and the techniques used by the instruments to control the formants) but<br/>&gt; more importantly because it takes the common ideas to extremes not present<br/>&gt; in the earlier piece.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; You are right that _Stimmung_ is related to the whole new-agish &apos;overtone<br/>&gt; singing&apos; enterprise here in Germany (which has really slowed down since<br/>&gt; actual Tuvan and Mongolian singers started appearing live in Germany<br/>&gt; shopping districts, playing for spare change), much as David Hyke&apos;s choir<br/>&gt; was related to Young&apos;s ensemble work.  It is an interesting social-cultural<br/>&gt; and economic phenomenon and  many of the performers are very accomplished<br/>&gt; at what they do but I find it hard to imagine that there is really<br/>&gt; sufficient content in these musics to drive a music-theoretical discussion<br/>&gt; of any depth or weight.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; ------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>&gt; To unsubscribe from this mailing list, or to change your subscription<br/>&gt; to digest, go to the ONElist web site, at <a href="http://www.onelist.com">http://www.onelist.com</a> and<br/>&gt; select the User Center link from the menu bar on the left.<br/>&gt; ------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>&gt; You do not need web access to participate.
