I&apos;m also a visual artist, and the visual design<br/>of my posts is usually an intrinsic part of the whole content.</p><p>So in order for the &apos;subject&apos; line to read properly when<br/>a respondent clicks &apos;reply&apos;, and in order to keep quotes<br/>well-organized, I like to keep my important posts separate.</p><p>But for the shorter and more casual posts, yes, you are<br/>correct, and from now on I&apos;ll lump quick responses into<br/>one longer post.</p><p>To Polychroni Moniodis:<br/>-----------------------</p><p>Thanks for the clarification re: genetics.</p><p>I&apos;ve received a fair amount of positive and negative feedback<br/>about my political comments (actually, they were really ethical)<br/>on the List.  I&apos;m going to post here part of a reply that<br/>I&apos;ve sent to several people, just to make my views clear.</p><p>And this is the last time I will discuss this topic here.<br/>Anyone may feel free to correspond with me off-list about it.</p><p>---------- forward: monz&apos;s politics ----------------------</p><p>I did not mean to imply that NATO or the US or anyone<br/>else involved in this conflict is blameless - far from it.</p><p>I had second thoughts about responding to anything regarding<br/>Hitler on the tuning list anyway.</p><p>My political stance boils down to the fact that I am a<br/>pacifist and do not accept war as a solution to humanity&apos;s<br/>problems - ever.</p><p>Call me a utopian, but I believe that we *should* have a<br/>one-world/one-country democratic government and a steady-state<br/>socialist economy.  Whether we ever *will* achieve it, well, who<br/>knows?  It looks as doubtful now as it ever did.  Thank goodness<br/>for the internet and the free flow of information.  Someday I&apos;ll have<br/>stuff about these views on my website.</p><p>---------------------------------------------</p><p>-monz</p><p>Joseph L.
