Did the old<br/>guys have it right? Is the modern version the superior tuning?  How tight does<br/>it have to be to be &quot;equal&quot;?  This battlefield has seen action for a long<br/>time, and there are few bullets yet fresh enough to do mortal harm.</p><p>    I have seen several points made; a few of them are calling for some<br/>comment.<br/>     The concept of a &apos;reverse well temperament&apos; depends on accepting that<br/>micro-deviations have the capacity to make fundamental changes in a tuning&apos;s<br/>harmonic nature.  I don&apos;t agree with this.  It appears that audiences don&apos;t<br/>make this distinction and I don&apos;t think the magnitude is such that modern ears<br/>register it.  Yes, by clinical standards, the favoring of the simpler key<br/>fifths can cause there to be more beating in those key&apos;s thirds, but not on a<br/>discernible scale.<br/>      Aside from the one in a thousand that can tell the difference between<br/>reverse and normal ET, this is not a matter that bears much consideration,<br/>IMO.  It is just not a practical distinction for use in the workaday world of<br/>useful tunings,  and is certainly no reason to label the ET as currently sold<br/>as invalid and indicative of ignorance.</p><p>    Also, I want to suggest a reality check. The creation of a temperament,<br/>such as Bill Bremmer&apos;s, that no one but himself has yet to properly tune, is<br/>an interesting academic excercise, but if it&apos;s production is limited to one<br/>person,  it has no chance of having much effect on constantly renewing musical<br/>tastes.  Its value will have to rest as a museum piece or an easier way to<br/>achieve it must be found.<br/>    The tunings have to be accessible to be effective,  which is why the<br/>machines of today are the salvation of our instruments other &quot;voices&quot;.<br/>    I have also felt pretty secure following Owen Jorgensen&apos;s directives,<br/>feeling that the scholarly weight of his work protected me, and the spirit of<br/>Kirnberger or Vallotti would be there as I followed his instructions.  I had a<br/>historically protected reason for bending the tunings around,  I was legit,<br/>right?.<br/>    On the other hand,  I had considered the authoring of new temperaments to<br/>be somewhat silly, since we knew what the piano had evolved with, and the<br/>first order of business was to re-acquaint ourselves with its intonational<br/>DNA, so to speak.  What use was there is trying to reinvent something??<br/>    Then I got my hands on a hot one.   Jim Coleman sent me his list of 12<br/>numbers, and I had my small Chickering grand tuned in his &quot;ModX&quot; by noon.  I<br/>am impressed beyond all expectations!  This is a very sophisticated tuning,<br/>and it provides its tonal variation in a way that keep the added tempering<br/>from becoming noticible,  while still providing a textural feel that ET simply<br/>does not have.<br/>   Plotting the width of the thirds, (modulating by fourths), as a bar graph,<br/>the shape of the tuning is one of fairly even, but parabolic increase.   At<br/>the more Just end of the temperament, the thirds of C-E and G-B are only 7.8<br/>cents wide, with F having a 8.8 cent F-A third, it may as well reside in this<br/>same group of &quot;calm&quot; keys.    &#x9;Next, there is a small step up to almost 12<br/>cent thirds for the keys of Bb and D, ( we are moving out by fourths and<br/>fifths, in both directions from the key of C),and then two more steps of about<br/>a cent for the thirds in Eb and A.  Eb and A are usually the keys most like<br/>ET, but in the ModX they are slightly more active.<br/>   After E and Ab weigh in with 16.8 cents thirds, there is a trio of very<br/>&quot;expressive&quot; keys across the top of the circle of fifths. B, C#, and Db are<br/>all tempered by 17.8 cents, and have some really nice sounding fifths.  This<br/>amount of tempering is noticible to the modern ear, but with clean octaves and<br/>unisons, my customers have come to like the churning contrast in other<br/>temperaments that have 17 cent thirds.  It is not too much for today&apos;s taste.<br/>   This tuning is very active.  Good clarity in the fifths, and I think there<br/>are some equal beating aspects in there, but have not had time to analyze that<br/>far.  The points of rest are there,  and the agressive modulation is  rewarded<br/>with a very effective dose of dissonance.   I am going to see if this may not<br/>be a good tuning in a small jazz club here in town.  The player told me he<br/>sometimes needs a blowtorch to cut through the combo.  Hmmmm.<br/>     Anyhow, thanks Jim, your temperament is # 8 in my machine.  I put it<br/>there thinking what kind of 8-ball idea it might be, but I have now seen the<br/>light, turned the corner, did a 180, changed my tune, etc.    and this might<br/>be one really effective tuning.  I will let you know how it sails.<br/>Regards,<br/>Ed Foote</p></div>
