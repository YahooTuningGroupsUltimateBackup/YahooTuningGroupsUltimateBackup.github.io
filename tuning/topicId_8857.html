It did not sound any more locked than the tempered third (I doubt that the 0.4 cent error affects the result).  I was talking to someone today who told me of an experience in Germany where the choir conductor led arpeggio warm-ups, intentionally sharpening the +3rds.  This was to overcompensate for the choirs tendency to sing increasingly flat over the course of a performance.  It was also mentioned that the weather, humidity, time of day, etc. can affect a choirs tendency to sing flat - thus increasing the need to compensate.  (someone earlier mentioned overcompensation as a possible cause).</p><p>Also, unless I missed an e-mail, has context been discussed?  If we&apos;re talking about the third in a chord functioning as a dominant, the tendency might be to treat that tone as a leading-tone to the tonic root.  C-E-G to F.  I believe that there is a tendency to sing leading tones sharp.  I could follow up with some actual names and sources if this seems at all relevant.</p><p>Hope I&apos;m not being redundant, P.

Like you we asked Jerry if he thought the high third occured mainly<br/>in chords functioning as the dominant, and he said no, it could just as<br/>easily be the tonic. Since you just joined us, you might want to look over<br/>the onelist archives starting with Jerry&apos;s first post on 12/17/99.</p></div>
