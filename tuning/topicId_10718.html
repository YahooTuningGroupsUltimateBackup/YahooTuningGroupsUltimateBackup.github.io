I<br/>have also used them to investigate tetrachords (thus the scale in Lou Harrison Primer) and for<br/>rhythm. The thing I like about the Hexanies is its cyclical nature as well as the various ways<br/>one can look at a small series of tones.  If seems that the degenerate forms destroy the very<br/>reason one would use a hexany. Even hexanies like the 1-3-5-9 I found of such perceptible<br/>ambiguousness that i don&apos;t use them except I stellate them with tones found in the two<br/>structures already mentioned. Actually i will use them straight in extended eikosany passages<br/>where the function of each note has a chance to seep in. Working with these Eikosanies for<br/>years, the statement of even a single tetrads will tell me every thing in the surrounding<br/>tonal area. Potentially such a structure becomes a strong of force as tonality.</p><p>Joseph Pehrson wrote:</p><p>&gt;  I bet a person could devote a<br/>&gt; WHOLE LIFETIME to just working with different hexanies.  (Is that YOU,<br/>&gt; Kraig Grady??)  This is a MUCH different experience that working with<br/>&gt; the various &quot;flavors&quot; of 19 per octave, exciting as that is... where the<br/>&gt; tuning differences are subtle, at best (surprise, surprise.)<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; The point is, one cannot easily &quot;substitute&quot; one hexany tuning for<br/>&gt; another and still have the same composition!  It isn&apos;t just a different<br/>&gt; &quot;flavor,&quot; it&apos;s a WHOLE DIFFERENT PIECE!!<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I have a question concerning &quot;degenerate&quot; hexanies, which are my<br/>&gt; favorite ;-).  Why are they called &quot;degenerate?&quot;  Is it because the<br/>&gt; ratios don&apos;t quite work out to small numbers.  I&apos;m thinking of the<br/>&gt; example:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; <a href="http://1.3.11.33">1.3.11.33</a> Hexany, degenerate pentatonic form<br/>&gt;   0:          1/1               0.000 unison, perfect prime<br/>&gt;   1:          4/3             498.045 perfect fourth<br/>&gt;   2:         11/8             551.318 undecimal semi-augmented fourth<br/>&gt;   3:         16/11            648.682 undecimal semi-diminished fifth<br/>&gt;   4:          3/2             701.955 perfect fifth<br/>&gt;   5:          2/1            1200.000 octave<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I guess that would make sense, with the &quot;semi-diminished fifth&quot; and so<br/>&gt; forth, the &quot;traditional&quot; pentatonic from the pythagorean having smaller<br/>&gt; ratios... (that is except for the 27/16!)<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Please explain &quot;degeneracy&quot; to me.  This is something I need to know<br/>&gt; about quickly.<br/>&gt;</p><p>-- Kraig Grady<br/>North American Embassy of Anaphoria island<br/><a href="http://www.anaphoria.com">www.anaphoria.com</a></p></div>
