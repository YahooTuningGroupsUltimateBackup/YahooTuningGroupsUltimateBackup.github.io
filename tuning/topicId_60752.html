Secor<br/>  To: <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a><br/>  Sent: 26 Eyl&uuml;l 2005 Pazartesi 21:51<br/>  Subject: [tuning] Re: scales formed by alternating thirds/dual generators</p><p>  Margo Schulter and I speculated about an alternate historical path<br/>  for *western Europe* beginning around the 13th century, but in a<br/>  superpythagorean rather than a schismic framework.  Following the<br/>  idea that the requirements for effective melody (i.e., small<br/>  semitones via wide fifths) might have taken precedence over consonant<br/>  harmony (i.e., more consonant triads via narrow fifths), we concluded<br/>  that a tempered 6:7:9 would have eventually become the most consonant<br/>  tonic triad in a septimal non-5 harmonic system, with 11 (as<br/>  6:7:9:11, e.g.) entering the picture as harmonic development<br/>  progressed.  This would have resulted in a closed system of either 17<br/>  or 22 tones.  In our alternate path we chose 17 over 22 for several<br/>  reasons: its melodic properties, a fifth less heavily tempered, our<br/>  desire to maintain non-5 harmony, and the possibility of interpreting<br/>  neutral intervals as ratios of 13 (as well as 11).  In this there are<br/>  striking parallels (as well as notable differences) with the<br/>  development of 5-limit harmony in a meantone framework (as explained<br/>  in my neo-medieval paper, which should appear some day in<br/>  Xenharmonikon 18).    For example, for the 17-division we expressed a<br/>  preference for a well-temperament over 17-ET, but had we chosen the<br/>  22-division, it would have probably been 22-equal, in which an<br/>  interval of 4 degrees is very close to a super-meantone 2nd (midway<br/>  between 8:9 and 7:8), making 22 analogous to 31.</p><p>  In our private discussion we wondered whether this might have any<br/>  relationship to Turkish or Arabic tuning.  Perhaps others would like<br/>  to comment.</p><p>  --George</p><p>  You can configure your subscription by sending an empty email to one<br/>  of these addresses (from the address at which you receive the list):<br/>    <a href="mailto:tuning-subscribe@yahoogroups.com">tuning-subscribe@yahoogroups.com</a> - join the tuning group.<br/>    <a href="mailto:tuning-unsubscribe@yahoogroups.com">tuning-unsubscribe@yahoogroups.com</a> - leave the group.<br/>    <a href="mailto:tuning-nomail@yahoogroups.com">tuning-nomail@yahoogroups.com</a> - turn off mail from the group.<br/>    <a href="mailto:tuning-digest@yahoogroups.com">tuning-digest@yahoogroups.com</a> - set group to send daily digests.<br/>    <a href="mailto:tuning-normal@yahoogroups.com">tuning-normal@yahoogroups.com</a> - set group to send individual emails.<br/>    <a href="mailto:tuning-help@yahoogroups.com">tuning-help@yahoogroups.com</a> - receive general help information.</p><p>------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>  YAHOO!

There is obviously no enharmonic equivalance of tones in, say, a 1/4 comma meantone. Likewise, your 17-tone temperament (circular as it is) also has no flat-sharp equivalance, although perhaps &grave;flat-doublesharp&grave;, or &grave;sharp-doubleflat&grave; equivalance at certain locations.

Even that is too many tones for a scale, if one defines a scale as a set of tones which one can use to write a melody.  A scale may or may not be a subset of a tuning (and it may or may not be MOS).</p><p>[oz]<br/>I, for one, consider 79 MOS 159-tET to be insufficient for Maqam Music, let alone 11. One may use as many as 30-40 pitches in a rolling Fasl that modulates through 14 Maqams and Terkibs within a single hour.</p><p>For expressing all Maqamat adequately through all Ahenks (which requires a change of diapason based practically on 12-EQ) with all the demanded microtonal articulations, vibratos, tremolandos, trills, etc... I might need to consider all the tones of 193-EQ which gives us 3 uninterrupted cycles of fifths whose sizes are 708.8, 702.6 and 696.4 cents respectively.</p><p>We are only able to categorize the subtle-nuances of pitch in Maqam Music as pitch-clusters, which obviously need to be sub-divided into microtonal compartments for better clarity. On the other hand, my highly crowded MOS suggestions are, I reluctantly admit, insufficient to express the complex tonal patterns of a live Maqam Music performance. Such is the scope of the tonal resource that Maqam Music contains!</p><p>[gs]<br/>I wouldn&apos;t call the above MOS scales &quot;modes.&quot;  As I understand it,<br/>modes of a scale consist of all of the members of that scale, being<br/>distinguished from one another only by which tone is considered the<br/>tonic or starting tone.</p><p>[oz]<br/>I imagine that not all would share your definition of &grave;mode&grave; here, which you clearly restrict to the octave-species of a single diatonical framework. In Fractal Tune Smithy, Robert uses the term Arpeggio for picking the desired tones from a larger scale, in Scala, Manuel uses the term mode instead.</p><p>[gs]<br/>BTW, Jacob Barton rediscovered the above 11-tone MOS scale earlier<br/>this year:<br/><a href="/makemicromusic/topicId_9132.html#9141">/makemicromusic/topicId_9132.html#9141</a><br/>Shortly thereafter I proposed the name &quot;barton&quot; for the scale, since<br/>he seems to have been the first to use it in a composition:<br/><a href="/tuning-math/message/11700">/tuning-math/message/11700</a></p><p>[oz]<br/>Do we have a chance to hear it online?</p><p>Best,</p><p>--George</p><p>Cordially,<br/>Ozan</p></div><h3><a id=60814 href="#60814">ðŸ”—</a>Ozan Yarman &#x3C;ozanyarman@superonline.com&#x3E;</h3><span>9/29/2005 12:39:09 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Carl,</p><p>If we shall constrain the usage of mode to Byzantine liturgical modes (and the Greek modes prior to that) where the only meaning maintained is &grave;octave-species&grave; in a diatonical framework, then I approve entirely, even if it means drastic revisions in our current understanding of the &grave;Orient&grave;.</p><p>But then, Maqams are not simply scales.

Nevertheless, he DID try to introduce Western-oriented (excuse the pun) ears to the world of Maqamat by composing little pieces in the manner of waltz according to his own system of microtonal notation.</p><p>Nevertheless, 24-Pythagorean does not suffice to explain the delicate nature of this genre. His shortcomings can be summarized as follows:</p><p>1. Disregarding the importance of temperament as a necessary tool for easy&amp;correct modulation and transposition.</p><p>2. Misunderstanding Western staff notation and the function of accidentals (apotome sharp being 7 fifths up minus 4 octaves without exception, tempered or not).</p><p>3. Misrepresenting the pitches of a Pythagorean system of tuning by using the sharps and flats the wrong way and hampering transposability as a result.</p><p>4. Forsaking a strict JI approach entirely.</p><p>5. Notating Rast as D first, then as G according to Mansur Ahenk in standard diapason with an octave error.</p><p>6. Leaving behind him a musical heritage that has no bearing of the concept of Key Transposition and what it entails.</p><p>Of course I will continue to use the term Maqam for the Maqamat. But when it comes to explaining what this really is, which do you think is a better term? Mode or Key?</p><p>Granted, some maqams function as modes of a common scale, but that is not all there is to it. Segah is not just a Rast scale with the tonic at 3rd degree, because unlike rast, it requires a 13/11 (or 32/27) as a leading tone, which you will not find it Rast. And certain notes of Rast can alterate radically, such as chargah (4th degree) becoming hisar (7/5 to 10/7), and evdj becoming adjem (16/9)</p><p>For a better explanation, I ask for your patience as I prepare the framework of my dissertation in the English language.</p><p>Cordially,<br/>Ozan<br/>  ----- Original Message -----<br/>  From: Carl Lumma<br/>  To: <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a><br/>  Sent: 30 Eyl&uuml;l 2005 Cuma 12:35<br/>  Subject: [tuning] Re: A 17-note scale in an alternative Western History</p><p>  &gt; But then, Maqams are not simply scales.

I was experimenting with this scale in a more Western manner,<br/>&gt; with full harmony -- very different from a maqam style, no<br/>doubt.  :-)<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; [oz]<br/>&gt; Really now, I would not have thought that one could practice with<br/>such a scale without discovering elements of Maqam Music by chance,<br/>or something akin to it.</p><p>Elements, perhaps -- but the style I would expect to be quite<br/>different, since I was using mostly 4-part harmony.</p><p>&gt; &gt; What is the difference between the two alterations?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; [gs]<br/>&gt; In 17 a chromatic alteration (using a sharp or flat) is 2 degrees,<br/>&gt; whereas enharmonic pairs of sharps and flats (e.g., D# vs. Eb)<br/>differ by a single degree.  So an enharmonic alteration would be one<br/>degree (using a semisharp or semiflat).  An example of an enharmonic<br/>progression (taken from my paper) would be:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Bv B  C<br/>&gt; G------<br/>&gt; F---- Eb<br/>&gt; Dv Db C<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; This is the resolution of a 13:16:18:22 chord to a subminor<br/>&gt; (6:7:9:12) triad with passing tones introduced between the two. The<br/>&gt; first and final chords are all members of the fundamental scale I<br/>&gt; gave above.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; [oz]<br/>&gt; You mean to say, that a chromatic alteration is an augmented prime,<br/>which is &quot;the difference between the &grave;whole-tone&grave; and the &grave;diatonic<br/>semitone&grave; (that is otherwise 5 &grave;fifths&grave; up minus 3 &grave;octaves&grave;<br/>subtracted from the fundamental tone)&quot;?</p><p>Yes.</p><p>&gt; Then a chromatic semitone of your 17 tone scale would be:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; 214.441 - 63.898 = 150.543 cents<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; However, at other locations in your scale, the size of the<br/>chromatic semitone seems to diminish as far down as 130.639 cents.<br/>Correct?</p><p>Yes.</p><p>&gt; As for the enharmonic semitone, I have read a little from<br/>Monz&apos;s &quot;Speculations on Marchetto of Padua&apos;s &grave;Fifth-tones&grave;&quot; (&copy;, 1997-<br/>8-9) at <a href="http://www.sonic-arts.org/monzo/marchet/marchet.htm">http://www.sonic-arts.org/monzo/marchet/marchet.htm</a><br/>&gt; that an enharmonic semitone is as wide as 2 diesis within the whole-<br/>tone.</p><p>The single degree in 17-WT ranges from about 64 to 78 cents, and a<br/>diesis is 1/5 tone (~40 cents).  So 2 dieses for an enharmonic<br/>semitone is in the right ballpark.  (I also see that Marchetto&apos;s<br/>chromatic semitone is given as 4 dieses.)</p><p>&gt; But I understand that you mean those enharmonic pairs of tones<br/>which include, e.g., Eb and D#, both of which, in a closed cyclic<br/>system of tuning such as your temperament extra-ordinaire, produce<br/>the same pitch.</p><p>That statement would apply only to a closed cyclic system of *12*<br/>tones.</p><p>&gt; There is obviously no enharmonic equivalance of tones in, say, a<br/>1/4 comma meantone. Likewise, your 17-tone temperament (circular as<br/>it is) also has no flat-sharp equivalance, although perhaps &grave;flat-<br/>doublesharp&grave;, or &grave;sharp-doubleflat&grave; equivalance at certain locations.<br/>Correct?</p><p>No; flat-semisharp and sharp-semiflat would be equivalent in 17.<br/>Your statement above would be true for the 19-division of the octave.</p><p>&gt; [gs]<br/>&gt; How do you reckon 9 or 11 tones to be &quot;so few&quot; pitches for a scale.<br/>I thought that 11 tones might even be too many to be comprehended<br/>easily.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Or did you mean that a 17-tone tuning is &quot;so few&quot; pitches?  Even<br/>that is too many tones for a scale, if one defines a scale as a set<br/>of tones which one can use to write a melody.  A scale may or may not<br/>be a subset of a tuning (and it may or may not be MOS).<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; [oz]<br/>&gt; I, for one, consider 79 MOS 159-tET to be insufficient for Maqam<br/>Music, let alone 11. One may use as many as 30-40 pitches in a<br/>rolling Fasl that modulates through 14 Maqams and Terkibs within a<br/>single hour.</p><p>But what one commonly thinks of as a &quot;scale&quot; (see my definition,<br/>above) would exclude that many pitches.  If a melody modulates from<br/>one set of tones to another, then it is used in more than one scale,<br/>inasmuch as it is being &quot;transported&quot; from one scale to another.  I<br/>would consider those 30-40 pitches to be a &quot;tuning&quot;, or at least a<br/>subset of a tuning.  And I would not feel compelled to consider non-<br/>scale tones used as ornamental embellishments _de facto_ members of<br/>the scale, just as a chromatically altered tones in Western diatonic<br/>music are not considered members of the (heptatonic) major or minor<br/>scale in which a composition is written.</p><p>&gt; For expressing all Maqamat adequately through all Ahenks (which<br/>requires a change of diapason based practically on 12-EQ) with all<br/>the demanded microtonal articulations, vibratos, tremolandos, trills,<br/>etc... I might need to consider all the tones of 193-EQ which gives<br/>us 3 uninterrupted cycles of fifths whose sizes are 708.8, 702.6 and<br/>696.4 cents respectively.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; We are only able to categorize the subtle-nuances of pitch in Maqam<br/>Music as pitch-clusters, which obviously need to be sub-divided into<br/>microtonal compartments for better clarity. On the other hand, my<br/>highly crowded MOS suggestions are, I reluctantly admit, insufficient<br/>to express the complex tonal patterns of a live Maqam Music<br/>performance. Such is the scope of the tonal resource that Maqam Music<br/>contains!<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; [gs]<br/>&gt; I wouldn&apos;t call the above MOS scales &quot;modes.&quot;  As I understand it,<br/>&gt; modes of a scale consist of all of the members of that scale, being<br/>&gt; distinguished from one another only by which tone is considered the<br/>&gt; tonic or starting tone.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; [oz]<br/>&gt; I imagine that not all would share your definition of &grave;mode&grave; here,<br/>which you clearly restrict to the octave-species of a single<br/>diatonical framework. ...</p><p>There was further discussion about this, and I would agree that using<br/>the term &quot;Maqam&quot; instead of &quot;mode&quot; would eliminate all sorts of<br/>confusion -- once its meaning was explained.</p><p>&gt; [gs]<br/>&gt; BTW, Jacob Barton rediscovered the above 11-tone MOS scale earlier<br/>&gt; this year:<br/>&gt; <a href="/makemicromusic/topicId_9132.html#9141">/makemicromusic/topicId_9132.html#9141</a><br/>&gt; Shortly thereafter I proposed the name &quot;barton&quot; for the scale,<br/>since<br/>&gt; he seems to have been the first to use it in a composition:<br/>&gt; <a href="/tuning-math/message/11700">/tuning-math/message/11700</a><br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; [oz]<br/>&gt; Do we have a chance to hear it online?</p><p><a href="/makemicromusic/topicId_9132.html#9132">/makemicromusic/topicId_9132.html#9132</a><br/><a href="/makemicromusic/topicId_9358.html#9358">/makemicromusic/topicId_9358.html#9358</a></p><p>Best,</p><p>--George</p></div><h3><a id=60865 href="#60865">ðŸ”—</a>wallyesterpaulrus &#x3C;wallyesterpaulrus@yahoo.com&#x3E;</h3><span>9/30/2005 2:22:44 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;Gene Ward Smith&quot; &lt;gwsmith@s...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt; --- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;George D.

Though we have a very precise definition of scales on<br/>tuning-math that would not include things like Maqam, conventional<br/>Western theory does use the term &quot;scale&quot; for things like the<br/>melodic minor, in which the pitch classes depend on which direction<br/>you&apos;re playing in the scale!</p><p>&gt; Granted, some maqams function as modes of a common scale, but<br/>&gt; that is not all there is to it.

And no western key tells you in which octave your final note will be.</p><p>You agree to limiting the term &quot;scale&quot; within a historically accurate context, and not the term &quot;mode&quot;? Mode is only the changing of the tonic in a given economical scale, which does not at all describe what Maqams are, let alone the melodic and harmonic minor genera in Western common practice. I understand that you wish mode could be interpreted in such a way as to include all possible alterations from a larger pitch-set, in which case I would have little to object against when defining the Maqamat. However, the concept &quot;genera&quot; would be a more exact term if we are talking about joined tetrachords and their divisions. Still, all these say nothing about how the SEYIR (melodic excursion) of a Maqam should be, which degrees should be emphasized, which modulations are more desirable, which transpositions are allowed without destroying the character of a Maqam, etc...</p><p>Key, on the other hand, is not bound up exclusively in Western practive as you assume, because there is an inherent harmony as implied by the usage of a particular Maqam. This clandestine harmony exists in the Ney, Kemencha, Tanbur, Oud, and even the Qudum (bowl sized timpani made from animal skin). For sure, tonics and dominants exist in the Maqamat. It&apos;s just that they are not always a pure fifth apart! Mere transpositions also exist, even when scales are not tempered, as some Maqams are carried up by a pure fourth or a fifth, and even an octave.</p><p>You assume that a key with many accidentals should modulate to keys with more accidentals in Classical sonatas? How about:</p><p>C#  B    A<br/>E#  E    E<br/>C#  D    C#<br/>G#  G#  A<br/>C#  E    A<br/>?</p><p>It is equally easy to modulate in both directions, and I see this done in many pieces from the Classical and Baroque eras. So, a key does not specify an exact direction, it merely includes the element of direction, modulation, transposition, alteration, etc... Also, you neglect the role of tonics an octave apart since your ear is conditioned by &grave;octave equivalance&grave;. In the world of Maqamat, the pitches of the fundamental gamut are classified all the way up three octaves from Kaba Rast to Tiz Gerdaniye, and these are all relative frequencies with Rast at 1/1 and they are all produced from the Ney! It does matter at which relative frequency one comes to rest in Maqam Music, even when (tempered) octaves of a piano register the same to Western ears. You overlook the fact that a Maqam cannot be called a scale or mode for that very reason. Notice the concept &grave;Key of C Major&grave;. Likewise take note of the concept &grave;Key of Huzzam&grave;. Their tonal resources are entirely different and there is no implication of octave equivalance with Huzzam, while there indeed IS with C Major. C Major must end with C no matter where it may be, a composition in Huzzam must end with perde Segah (hence, 3rd place/diatonical degree in Persian), and it is only to be found at 27/22 to 5/4 from Rast, whose absolute frequency changes with the Ahenk (diapason). As for mode, a scale starting on the 8th degree is not different from a scale starting on the 1st degree of a diatonical scale, hence the term &grave;mode&grave; makes no distinction between these.</p><p>  On a microtonal level and in a context of well temperaments, you have a point, because exact transposition doesn&apos;t exist, However, I hold against that that an aria in an opera was readily transposed to the range of whoever happenend to sing it, and to hell with key<br/>  characteristics.</p><p>  klaus</p><p>Key color only exists in tempered instruments obviously! And an opera cannot be transposed without preparing related parts for standard diapason instruments such as the violins and harpsichords. All other instruments whose variation in proportion won&apos;t affect finger-to-pitch correlation (hence, the linear shift) are secure with the practice of Key Transposition. One does not need to re-write a score for the Clarinets or Trumpets or French Horns or the NEYs, as they can be, and ARE produced in any key.</p><p>Cordially,<br/>Ozan</p></div><h3><a id=61038 href="#61038">ðŸ”—</a>Gene Ward Smith &#x3C;gwsmith@svpal.org&#x3E;</h3><span>10/4/2005 10:44:40 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;Ozan Yarman&quot; &lt;ozanyarman@s...&gt; wrote:</p><p>&gt;   I believe that is close to how Gene has defined them.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; How has he defined it?</p><p>As a countable discrete set of relative pitches.

Looking at the classical sonata form from this<br/>&gt;&gt; point of view, pieces in the major mode tend to modulate to<br/>&gt;&gt; transpositions of the major mode, whereas pieces in the minor mode,<br/>&gt;&gt; when the modulate, alos change into the major mode. This is very<br/>&gt;&gt; different from, say, the tendency of a piece in a key with many<br/>&gt;&gt; accidentals not to modulate towards a key with even more<br/>&gt;&gt; accidentals. And no western key tells you in which octave your<br/>&gt;&gt; final note will be.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; You agree to limiting the term &quot;scale&quot; within a historically<br/>&gt; accurate context, and not the term &quot;mode&quot;?</p><p>No, I didn&apos;t talk about scales at all. I do find &quot;mode&quot; useful as a<br/>general term to talk about specific modal traditions like Gregorian<br/>chant, ragas, of maqams. When you happen to walk by a New Grove, try<br/>looking at the mode article there. You&apos;ll be surprised how many<br/>traditions, possibilities of rules, ... and pages there are.</p><p> Mode is only the<br/>&gt; changing of the tonic in a given economical scale,</p><p>No, it&apos;s not. The popular terms for the rotations of the white note<br/>scale are derived from Henricus Glarean&apos;s Dodekachordon, which treated<br/>12 modes, two each on C, D, E, F, G, and A. The two kinds were<br/>authentic and plagal, with their finals at the bottom of the compass<br/>or in the middle. The modes on C and A were Glarean&apos;s invention,<br/>acknowledging what would become the Major and Minor modes of Western<br/>music (he included the B modes for completeness&apos; sake, but called them<br/>unusable for their lacking fifth/fourth). The modes on D, E, F, and G<br/>had their own traditional melodic turns, finals and recitation tones<br/>(sometimes called &quot;dominants&quot;).</p><p>The current popular use of Glarean&apos;s mode names is probably due to<br/>Joseph Schillinger, who suggested &quot;transposition by modes&quot; to<br/>introduce variation or to arrive at new ideas. Note that he would use<br/>the interval structure of one mode with melodies that owed their<br/>existence to the melodic rules of a different one. Schillinger&apos;s<br/>teachings are the grounds on which the BerkLee College was built, and<br/>from there it obviously spread throughout the world. The popular<br/>notion of Dorian, Myxolydian, Ionian derives from playing around with,<br/>perverting, if you want, modes on a superficial level, but modes are a<br/>far richer concept.</p><p> which does not<br/>&gt; at all describe what Maqams are, let alone the melodic and harmonic<br/>&gt; minor genera in Western common practice. I understand that you wish<br/>&gt; mode could be interpreted in such a way as to include all possible<br/>&gt; alterations from a larger pitch-set, in which case I would have<br/>&gt; little to object against when defining the Maqamat. However, the<br/>&gt; concept &quot;genera&quot; would be a more exact term if we are talking about<br/>&gt; joined tetrachords and their divisions. Still, all these say<br/>&gt; nothing about how the SEYIR (melodic excursion) of a Maqam should<br/>&gt; be, which degrees should be emphasized, which modulations are more<br/>&gt; desirable, which transpositions are allowed without destroying the<br/>&gt; character of a Maqam, etc...</p><p>see above</p><p>&gt;<br/>&gt; Key, on the other hand, is not bound up exclusively in Western<br/>&gt; practive as you assume, because there is an inherent harmony as<br/>&gt; implied by the usage of a particular Maqam. This clandestine<br/>&gt; harmony exists in the Ney, Kemencha, Tanbur, Oud, and even the<br/>&gt; Qudum (bowl sized timpani made from animal skin). For sure, tonics<br/>&gt; and dominants exist in the Maqamat. It&apos;s just that they are not<br/>&gt; always a pure fifth apart!</p><p>Then they are modal recitation tones, not the dominants of functional<br/>harmony.</p><p> Mere transpositions also exist, even<br/>&gt; when scales are not tempered, as some Maqams are carried up by a<br/>&gt; pure fourth or a fifth, and even an octave.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; You assume that a key with many accidentals should modulate to keys<br/>&gt; with more accidentals in Classical sonatas?</p><p>I said the opposite, that a piece in a key with many sharps may have a<br/>tendency to modulate into keys with less sharps rather than advancing<br/>towards the double sharps. This was my attempt to make a key determine<br/>the fate of the music; it has nothing to do with what I think.</p><p> How about:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; C#  B    A E#  E    E C#  D    C# G#  G#  A C#  E    A ?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; It is equally easy to modulate in both directions, and I see this<br/>&gt; done in many pieces from the Classical and Baroque eras. So, a key<br/>&gt; does not specify an exact direction, it merely includes the element<br/>&gt; of direction, modulation, transposition, alteration, etc... Also,<br/>&gt; you neglect the role of tonics an octave apart since your ear is<br/>&gt; conditioned by &grave;octave equivalance&grave;. In the world of Maqamat, the<br/>&gt; pitches of the fundamental gamut are classified all the way up<br/>&gt; three octaves from Kaba Rast to Tiz Gerdaniye, and these are all<br/>&gt; relative frequencies with Rast at 1/1 and they are all produced<br/>&gt; from the Ney! It does matter at which relative frequency one comes<br/>&gt; to rest in Maqam Music, even when (tempered) octaves of a piano<br/>&gt; register the same to Western ears. You overlook the fact that a<br/>&gt; Maqam cannot be called a scale or mode for that very reason.</p><p>No, it can&apos;t be called a key, because the key of C ends on a C - any C.

In fact, the &quot;Key (Maqam) of Huzzam&quot; does contain specific pitch-level information in terms of relative frequencies! You on the other hand think that key has to be an absolute frequency. Granted! The existance of transposable instruments of the orchestra justify a standard diapason to determine the reference key. But you seem to think that the standard was always in place, which wasn&apos;t until at least two centuries ago according to my knowledge. Hypothetically, the key of A could be played anywhere in the pitch-continuum! Seeing as Maqam Music similarly can be performed in any Ahenk (diapason), it stands to reason that one needs to consider &quot;natural perdes&quot; diatonical degrees (relative frequencies), which happen to coincide with the standard diapason in Sipurde Ahenk with perde Rast at C4.</p><p>I will let this be the Key of Sipurde for your satisfaction as the definition of key without capital.</p><p>My point was that you implied no other information could be contained in the key, whereas I have shown you that my claims are supported by a published reference.</p><p>Thus I will let Huzzam, Rast, Usshaq, Hijaz, Saba, Nihavend, Kurdi et al. be the Key with the capital implying all that you read in my previous post.</p><p>In short, you can retain your simplified meaning, I shall retain my definition which is included with the 4th Edition of Harvard&apos;s Dictionary of Music in accordance with historical practice and my experience.</p><p>Cordially,<br/>Ozan<br/>  ----- Original Message -----<br/>  From: wallyesterpaulrus<br/>  To: <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a><br/>  Sent: 05 Ekim 2005 &Ccedil;ar&scedil;amba 2:16<br/>  Subject: [tuning] Re: A 17-note scale in an alternative Western History</p><p>  Ozan, let&apos;s put our dictionaries down for a moment.

I prefer to have at<br/>least one note between the notes of the &apos;harmony&apos;, i.e. the generator<br/>describes at least a fifth. (for no better reason than that is the<br/>case for the diatonic scale) Of more concern to me is the relation<br/>between L and s, which is 5/2 = 2.5. This is not as bad as 3 to 1 of<br/>the diatonic in 17EDO. However, I took a look at the generator of 7,<br/>and noticed that if the segment was extended to 31 elements, a new<br/>scale is formed:</p><p>3 2 2 3 2 2 3 2 2 3 2 2 3 2 2 3 2 2 3 2 2 3 2 2 3 2 2 3 2 2 2</p><p>I think you have a name for it. Canasta? - apologies if not</p><p>For this scale, the generator covers a &apos;fourth&apos; of the scale, so the<br/>generator cannot be &apos;bisected&apos; to form a harmony. My biggest problem<br/>with this (and blackjack) is that its notes are a semitone apart, so<br/>i suspect that presentations of the scale would be heard as chromatic.</p><p>There is some perceptual theory that asserts that we poor human<br/>beings can&apos;t appreciate the complexities of more than a few<br/>simultaneous things, so maybe musical scales are kept to small number<br/>(like 5 or 7 or 9). Of course, that doesn&apos;t mean the total gamut be<br/>restricted to this number. Can&apos;t say whether I agree with the theory<br/>or not, but I tried blackjack, I noted that diatonic subsets could be<br/>formed (after a fashion). How far does 31 from 72 deviate from<br/>31EDO?, I wonder - without bothering to look atm. Scales within<br/>scales within scales....</p><p>As regards the scale formation in 31EDO for example and the<br/>difference between 3 and 28, it is best to consider the f to fsharp<br/>rule in scale transposition. Transposing the scale from 31EDO up by 3<br/>results in the flattening of a pitch. Therefore transposing by the<br/>complement, 28 results in the raising of a pitch. I consider that the<br/>generator interval is the upward transposition of the scale that<br/>results in an f to Fsharp type motion. Again by analogy with LLsLLLs<br/>diatonic.</p><p>I have to admit that scales where L &gt; 2 x s concern me, if only<br/>because in the JI diatonic the chromatic interval is very definitely<br/>smaller than the smallest interval in a scale. 25/24 as opposed to<br/>16/15.

Far be it for me to consider modal music an inferior genre of tonality, I was just insinuating that certain people might tend to think in such a chauvanistic manner and categorize the Maqamat as modes just so that they might envision Eastern music to be devoid of harmony.</p><p>As to the confusion about the rushly uttered phrase &grave;pre-tonal&grave;, I admit I carelessly used it as a synonym for &quot;predecessor of Classical Tonality&grave;. Granted, modal music has its own virtues which are just as admirable as any other culture&apos;s. Nevertheless, modality is distinct from what we conceive as &grave;tonality&grave;, doubtless, a misnomer for polyphonic European music composed and performed mostly after the 17th century, in that it considers fourths, fifths and octaves as restful instead of thirds.</p><p>From this perspective, the Maqamat are more tonal than modal since at least three centuries. This is the reason why I insist on the concept &grave;key&grave;. It has nothing to do with musical superiority for gosh sakes! This is so, even when tools of composition and harmony may be superior in design. Just because one possesses improved tools does not in anyway imply that the final product should be superior. The shortcomings of that particular way of thinking can be observed most clearly in the case of the ideological fiasco that attempted to create the Nationalist Turkish School of music. Some of us here in Turkey still insolently believe that polyphonic contemporary music of questionable Turkish identity is superior to the monophonic genres that &grave;run amok&grave;. I shun such opinions vehemently of course.</p><p>&grave;Evolution&grave;, or at least &grave;Historical continuity&grave; in all musics should exist, but not to the extent where posterity runs the risk of classifying past examples as less worthy.

Far be it for me to consider modal<br/>music an inferior genre of tonality, I was just insinuating that certain<br/>people might tend to think in such a chauvanistic manner and categorize the<br/>Maqamat as modes just so that they might envision Eastern music to be devoid<br/>of harmony.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; As to the confusion about the rushly uttered phrase &grave;pre-tonal&grave;, I admit I<br/>carelessly used it as a synonym for &quot;predecessor of Classical Tonality&grave;.<br/>Granted, modal music has its own virtues which are just as admirable as any<br/>other culture&apos;s. Nevertheless, modality is distinct from what we conceive as<br/>&grave;tonality&grave;, doubtless, a misnomer for polyphonic European music composed and<br/>performed mostly after the 17th century, in that it considers fourths,<br/>fifths and octaves as restful instead of thirds.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; From this perspective, the Maqamat are more tonal than modal since at<br/>least three centuries. This is the reason why I insist on the concept &grave;key&grave;.<br/>It has nothing to do with musical superiority for gosh sakes! This is so,<br/>even when tools of composition and harmony may be superior in design. Just<br/>because one possesses improved tools does not in anyway imply that the final<br/>product should be superior. The shortcomings of that particular way of<br/>thinking can be observed most clearly in the case of the ideological fiasco<br/>that attempted to create the Nationalist Turkish School of music. Some of us<br/>here in Turkey still insolently believe that polyphonic contemporary music<br/>of questionable Turkish identity is superior to the monophonic genres that<br/>&grave;run amok&grave;. I shun such opinions vehemently of course.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &grave;Evolution&grave;, or at least &grave;Historical continuity&grave; in all musics should<br/>exist, but not to the extent where posterity runs the risk of classifying<br/>past examples as less worthy. So my argument rests on these two articles:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; 1. Good music is not confined to any particular genre or historical epoch.<br/>&gt; 2. Maqam music is not modal as if it was still stuck in the medieval era.</p><p>I think we understand each other!</p><p>Regards,<br/>Yahya</p><p>--<br/>No virus found in this outgoing message.<br/>Checked by AVG Anti-Virus.<br/>Version: 7.0.344 / Virus Database: 267.12.0/132 - Release Date: 13/10/05</p></div><h3><a id=61517 href="#61517">ðŸ”—</a>wallyesterpaulrus &#x3C;wallyesterpaulrus@yahoo.com&#x3E;</h3><span>10/17/2005 11:47:11 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;Ozan Yarman&quot; &lt;ozanyarman@s...&gt; wrote:</p><p>&gt; I did not bridge the gap between modality and tonality here as you<br/>&gt;presume I did.</p><p>I don&apos;t presume much about what you did.
