E.g., do<br/>&gt; you want to process these files in some general programming language<br/>&gt; with an XML parser available, or do you also want to extract and<br/>&gt; process information in these files, say, in a UNIX pipe where XML<br/>&gt; would make things more complex.</p><p>I really don&apos;t know enough about that to comment. As far as I know<br/>it is very easy to write an XML parser just using string manipulation,<br/>with just a few methods to find tags and attributes and get the values,<br/>and whatever is done with that data is app-specific. The main point<br/>for me is that the file should be totally human readable and requires<br/>absolute minimum of explanation for some developer to implement it.<br/>My own usage of XML so far has been quite pseudo, and the files<br/>contain app-specific data and character delimited strings within tags<br/>and all kinds of things which are not good for XML generally, but I<br/>can see a well formed XML which will bring all these things in tuning<br/>files which are so confusing finally into the light of day, and I think<br/>if that happens and it is used, then it will be a huge step forward for<br/>the future of tuning implementation in software.</p><p>Of course it&apos;s just my opinion.</p><p>Yours,<br/>Aaron H<br/>=====</p></div><h3><a id=79585 href="#79585">ðŸ”—</a>Carl Lumma &#x3C;carl@...&#x3E;</h3><span>12/20/2008 5:30:07 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, Torsten Anders &lt;torsten.anders@...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt; &gt; Manuel and Mark, is there any chance you would want to either make<br/>&gt; &gt; new xml versions of .scl and .tun file formats?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; There are some pros and cons to XML in general.
