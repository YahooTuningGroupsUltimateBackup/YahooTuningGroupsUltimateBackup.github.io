Yes, I was puzzled by John&apos;s identification with<br/>Schoenberg and Cage rather than say Terry Riley (although he did use TR&apos;s<br/>Poppy Nogood for one film). I&apos;m sure you&apos;re right - JI is like Differential<br/>Dynamics is like JI in that it&apos;s effectively a complete sounding overtone<br/>series controlling motion, many octaves below what we know as sound.</p><p>BA:One project he was interested in during his last years was the creation<br/>of<br/>realtime varying pitches to correspond to his dots on the screen of his<br/>animation composition software.

I both understand this, and find it<br/>untenable personally. I know an extremely keen fractal musician/composer who<br/>was very keen to only use scales of 12 (not 7) notes (less human filtered he<br/>felt). I think in fairness to JW sr that a very slow mass of sweepimg sines<br/>would gradually go in and out of harmonic resolution (it of course depends<br/>whether it is set up to resolve at chords of harmonics of a fundamental or<br/>at equal power divisions in a frequency space-  , although when I tried this<br/>in 1984 (with the former) I found it less interesting than JI scales with<br/>Harmonic math generated melodic systems, or than the sound mandalas I<br/>described. I would like to share with you my (and your) work in audio,<br/>visual and AV media.</p><p>BA:I have since created some animation with that and other software and with<br/>corresponding JI scores. Examples can be seen at<br/><a href="http://www2.hmc.edu/~alves/hiway70.html">http://www2.hmc.edu/~alves/hiway70.html</a> and<br/><a href="http://www2.hmc.edu/~alves/static.html">http://www2.hmc.edu/~alves/static.html</a>.</p><p>LB:I have Static Cling on the Iota compilation video/s which I enjoy<br/>(particularly its humour) very much. I can see the JW sr elements clearly<br/>and would be interested to know what you&apos;d make of my forays into<br/>visual/harmonic spaces.</p><p>BA:On the topic of &quot;sound mandalas,&quot; I created a kind of continuous mandala<br/>in<br/>which harmonics are faded in and out with the same kinds of ratios as in<br/>Whitney&apos;s differential dynamics, creating points when all pitches are<br/>present at correspondingly important points in the visuals.</p><p>LB: I&apos;d love to hear this Bill - I have CSound for the PPC Mac. Any chance I<br/>could see the design or see or have the gen for that? Or perhaps a quality<br/>recording?</p><p>BA: I did it as a<br/>Director/Shockwave presentation, but unfortunately it doesn&apos;t work well<br/>over the internet.

I have multi-standard here.</p><p>looking forward to exchanging further ideas and work with you if you&apos;re<br/>amenable.....</p><p>very best thoughts</p><p>Lawrence</p></div>
