In<br/>contrast, a usual JI system has five pure fifths plus a more<br/>dramatically impure one:</p><p>Just temperament (3/2, 13/11, 14/11)</p><p>   1/1    44/39    14/11  4/3      3/2    22/13    21/11  2/1<br/>    0    208.83   417.51 498.04   701.96  910.79  1119.46 1200<br/>      44:39   273:242 22:21    9:8     44:39  273:242  22:21<br/>      208.83  208.67  80.54   203.91  208.83  208.67   80.54</p><p>Archytas diatonic (3/2, 7/6, 9/7)</p><p>   1/1    9/8      9/7    4/3      3/2    27/16    27/14  2/1<br/>    0    203.91   435.08 498.04   701.96  905.87  1137.04 1200<br/>      9:8      8:7    28:27    9:8     9:8     8:7     28:27<br/>     203.91   231.17  62.96   203.91  203.91  231.17   62.96</p><p>Ptolemy syntonic diatonic (3/2, 5/4, 6/5)</p><p>   1/1    9/8      5/4    4/3      3/2     27/16   15/8    2/1<br/>    0    203.91   386.31 498.04   701.96   905.87 1088.27 1200<br/>      9:8     10:9    16:15    9:8     9:8     10:9   16:15<br/>     203.91  182.40  111.73   203.91  203.91  182.40  111.73</p><p>Thus in the Archytas diatonic based on prime factors of 3 and 7, we<br/>find that the fifth A-E at 32:21 or ~729.22 cents is wide by a full<br/>64:63 (~27.26 cents), the comma of Archytas as it has aptly been named<br/>by George Secor.</p><p>In the syntonic diatonic of Ptolemy, based on the primes 3 and 5, we<br/>find that the fifth A-E at 40:27 (~680.45 cents) is narrow by a full<br/>81:80 (~21.51 cents), the syntonic comma or comma of Didymus.</p><p>Looking more closely at the sizes of melodic steps in these just<br/>scales, we see that either the Archytas or Ptolemy diatonic involves<br/>two sizes of whole-tone steps plus a single diatonic semitone step<br/>(Archytas 9:8 or 8:7, 28:27; Ptolemy 9:8 or 10:9, 16:15).</p><p>In the just temperament, however, we have _three_ sizes of whole-tones<br/>at 9:8 (~203.91 cents), 273:242 (~208.67 cents), and 44:39 (~208.83<br/>cents), along with the diatonic semitone at 22:21 (~80.54 cents).</p><p>For now, I will note that the just temperament is therefore based on<br/>four commas, which might also be termed kleismas or schismas by those<br/>preferring to reserve the term &quot;comma&quot; for larger intervals like the<br/>familiar 81:80 of Didymus and 64:63 of Archytas.</p><p>These four small intervals are 896:891 (~9.69 cents); 352:351;<br/>364:363; and 10648:10647 (~0.162595 cents).

The last definition is illustrated in our just temperament<br/>by the sonority A-C-E, with 13:11 below and 14:11 above, producing an<br/>outer fifth at 182:121, wide by 364:363 (i.e. 121:143:182).</p><p>The 10648:10647 harmonisma, which I name in honor of Kathleen<br/>Schlesinger and her _harmoniai_ or just arithmetic divisions sometimes<br/>featuring the ratios 14:11 and 13:11, is equal to the difference<br/>between 352:351 and 364:363.</p><p>In our scale, the harmonisma occurs for example as the slight<br/>difference in the whole-tone steps of 44:39 (larger than 9:8 by<br/>352:351) and 273:242 (larger than 9:8 by 364:363).</p><p>In a following post, I will look more closely at how the pattern of<br/>these four ratios makes possible the artful compromises of a just<br/>temperament.

One<br/>astonishing example of this I have discovered twice now, in two different<br/>ways, so I think it is definitively worth taking note of as a real<br/>phenom. It is the 19-note Fokker block based on the two commas 81/80 and<br/>78732/78125. Considered merely as a 5-limit scale, it is about as<br/>ordinary as it gets, and sports eight major and eight minor triads.<br/>However, if we allow differences of 4375/4374 to count as just, we have<br/>in addition five subminor and five supermajor triads, three subminor and<br/>three supermajor tetrads, and one major and one minor tetrad. Since<br/>4375/4374 is so tiny (a mere 2/5 of a cent) we may regard these<br/>additional chords and intervals as effectively just.
