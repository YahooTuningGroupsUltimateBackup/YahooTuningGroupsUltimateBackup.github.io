When I said that nobody in my audiences knew a thing about tuning, I was trying to make a point...I wasn&apos;t expecting a scientific dissertation on tunings when I asked why there are 12 eq tones in an octave; I was sort of fishing, to see just who knows what about anything as far as tuning goes, and if anyone had come up with some sort of answer that was remotely in the ballpark, that would have been super cool. But, as I had, sadly, expected, nobody had a clue...and if they had, and wanted to chat about it, that would have been fine with me, as I like interplay when I do a class. Actually, the answer I was sort of hoping to hear was: there&apos;s 12 eq notes because Europeans were looking for a way to find a tuning system that would apply to music that modulated through a lot of chord changes, without sounding TOO much out of tune...and that&apos;s why 12 eq came into being, from what I&apos;ve learned over the years.<br/>  And yes, there are certainly other 12 tone systems, meantone and well being foremost...I know that, but since the infamous 12eq is the dominant system these days, it is a good place to start when talking about temperaments. I&apos;m pretty informal, and tend to come from a more &quot;street&quot; take on art, if you will...that&apos;s the way I am, and it works pretty well for me in most situations, especially when talking to people who know very little about music theory, or tunings.<br/>  Anyway, your comments are appreciated, it&apos;s good to get different viewpoints, it keeps one focused on why they believe the way they do...best...Hstick<br/><a href="http://www.microstick.net">www.microstick.net</a></p></div><h3>monz &#x3C;monz@tonalsoft.com&#x3E;</h3><span>4/22/2005 5:53:28 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;Neil Haverstick&quot; &lt;microstick@m...&gt;<br/>wrote:</p><p>&gt; &lt;snip&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Actually, the answer I was sort of hoping to hear was:<br/>&gt; there&apos;s 12 eq notes because Europeans were looking for a<br/>&gt; way to find a tuning system that would apply to music that<br/>&gt; modulated through a lot of chord changes, without sounding<br/>&gt; TOO much out of tune...</p><p>yes, this is also an important reason for the acceptance<br/>of 12-edo. more could be said on this point ...<br/>inspired by this discussion, i&apos;ve been adding some<br/>historical info to the new-and-improved Encyclopedia<br/>12-edo webpage (it will be online in a couple of weeks).</p><p>In connection with Neil&apos;s comment, it is worth pointing out<br/>that beginning with Mozart, and continuing more strongly with<br/>Beethoven and Schubert, 12-edo&apos;s membership in the augmented<br/>temperament&#x9;family began to be exploited more and more;<br/>the signpost of this technique is the use of pairs of<br/>enharmonically equivalent notes (i.e., notes which are<br/>&quot;spelled&quot; differently but have the same pitch in 12-edo)<br/>as common-tones.
