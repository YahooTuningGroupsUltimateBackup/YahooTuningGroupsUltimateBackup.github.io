I&apos;m looking for a graphic that<br/>&gt;shows the sets of *combined* dyadic harmonic entropy results<br/>&gt;for tetrads, which you discuss in message 11686.  Have you<br/>&gt;made one?  I thought that was what you&apos;ve been working on,<br/>&gt;and would love to see it.</p><p>Monz, maybe you missed where I wrote,</p><p>&gt;My computer is still crunching (since yesterday) on the tetradic analogue<br/>to the triadic stuff I just &gt;did. Hopefully it won&apos;t run out of memory, and<br/>then I&apos;ll report the local minima and local maxima of &gt;tetradic discordance<br/>(thanks John deLaubenfels) calculated using this total pairwise harmonic<br/>entropy &gt;method. I don&apos;t know of any way to make a meaningful graphic<br/>representation of it, though, since it &gt;would be a cube with colors changing<br/>all through its interior (the best you could do would be to pick a &gt;few<br/>arbitrary planes to &quot;slice&quot; through it).</p></div>
