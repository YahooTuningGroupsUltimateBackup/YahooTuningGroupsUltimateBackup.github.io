No! They understood that their work was an extension of<br/>the tuning practices that had already gone on applied to a different set of circumstances.<br/>Show me any historical reference where these tuning  referred to as any term not synonymous<br/>with Just intonation. If you look at Partch&apos;s book he refers to all these as Just intonation<br/>scales, same with Lou Harrison. La Monte Young i believe with not object to his music being<br/>referred to as  Just intonation. All these individuals are using the term as it has been used<br/>historically. To suggest that if I use the 37 harmonic that it is no longer Just intonation is<br/>rather limited. Call up La Monte and tell him we doesn&apos;t use JI and He would probably wonder<br/>what it is you are talking about.<br/>        There is no historical evidence that JI stops at 11 and 13. In fact if you want to be<br/>so strict, we could say that 7 is the historical limit and all 7 limit music is not in Just<br/>intonation.<br/>outside of those on this list, I know of anywhere else where the definition is so restrictive.</p><p>Monz wrote:</p><p>&gt; Kraig!<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Show me where it says that the Persians, Greeks and Novarro<br/>&gt; called their systems &apos;just-intonation&apos; and I&apos;ll make exceptions<br/>&gt; in their, and any other documentable ethno-chrono-centric,<br/>&gt; cases.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I suspect that you will be able to prove to me that Novarro called<br/>&gt; his system &apos;just&apos;, so his case would be very exceptional.

It&apos;s just not the same!
