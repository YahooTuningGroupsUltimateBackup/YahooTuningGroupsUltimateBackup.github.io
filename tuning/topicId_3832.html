Anyway, ask your friend to compare the tempered<br/>intervals again (the 8/5 should _not_ be just) and listen for the purely<br/>_sensual_ qualities of the intervals, abstracted from any possible tonal<br/>meanings or chordal implications.</p></div><h3><a id=3863 href="#3863">ðŸ”—</a>Carl Lumma &#x3C;clumma@nni.com&#x3E;</h3><span>7/2/1999 3:08:47 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>&gt;&gt;Well, if you play an 8:5:4 triad and then immediately play an 8:5 dyad, the<br/>&gt;&gt;dyad should sound more consonant than if played alone because the listener<br/>&gt;&gt;has already placed it in a harmonic series.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;So what does your friend do that&apos;s so impressive?</p><p>Nothing impressive.</p><p>&gt;&gt;I told my friend the same thing about the tempered tritone and the 8/5,<br/>&gt;&gt;except that he doesn&apos;t think the two are equally dissonant.
