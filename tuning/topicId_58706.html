The &quot;regional chart&quot; of chord<br/>relationships, according to this, goes back to Vial in 1767. It is<br/>closely related to the hexagonal tiling of 5-limit triads, which<br/>itself is dual to the lattice of 5-limit pitch classes. I&apos;m personally<br/>fond of this chart since I deconstructed it to the tiling of chords,<br/>and then went to the lattice of notes, getting it all from Schoenberg.<br/>It is interesting that it has such a pedigree, going back well before<br/>Riemann.</p></div>
