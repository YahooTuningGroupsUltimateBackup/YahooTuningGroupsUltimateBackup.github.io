For more accuracy we could use 4374/625<br/>instead, but an alternative is to make use of 2401/2400.</p><p>If we use the Hermite reduction mapping for 2401/2400, we find that it<br/>is generated by 2, 49/40, and 10/7; hence pitch classes can be<br/>represented by u=49/5 and v=5/7. From the mapping, we get</p><p>3 = u^2/32 * 2400/2401<br/>5 = u*v^2<br/>7 = u*v</p><p>and we can find the [u,v] coordinates of any 7-limit pitch class<br/>w = |* a b c&gt; by [h1(w), h2(w)], where h1 = &lt;0 2 1 1| and<br/>h2 = &lt;0 0 2 1|. This gives a form of the no-threes projection using<br/>the breed temperament I think I&apos;ve mentioned before.</p><p>The 32 note chord cube, which boils down to a 31 note scale in breed,<br/>which Bodacious Breed was written in, contains the following notes:</p><p>{[3, -2], [3, 2], [-2, 3], [1, -3], [1, -1], [1, 2], [3, 1], [0, 0],<br/>[0, 1], [0, 2], [2, 1], [2, 2], [0, 3], [1, 1], [1, 0], [0, 4], [4,<br/>3], [2, -1], [1, 3], [2, 3], [-1, -1], [4, 0], [-1, 1], [1, -2], [3,<br/>-1], [-2, 0], [0, -1], [2, 0], [2, 4], [-1, -2], [-1, 2]}</p><p>If I could figure out how to get Maple to draw stuff like this again,<br/>I could get a plot of it; it looks like it might be instructive.</p></div><h3>Gene Ward Smith &#x3C;gwsmith@svpal.org&#x3E;</h3><span>4/7/2005 12:35:24 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;Gene Ward Smith&quot; &lt;gwsmith@s...&gt; wrote:</p><p>Sorry, this was supposed to go to tuning-math.
