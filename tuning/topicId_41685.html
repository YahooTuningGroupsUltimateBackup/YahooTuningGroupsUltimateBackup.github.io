There&apos;s always been a debate, ever since John Knowles Paine convinced Harvard to make him our first music professor in the 1870s, as to whether music is truly an academic subject. Actually, the biggest thing I got from grad school was that I took quite a few graduate philosophy courses, which I wouldn&apos;t have been good enough to do as a philosophy major. Perhaps the best approach to grad school for musicians is to take courses outside your major, where you can really learn something.</p><p>And I&apos;ll mention one more thing. I had an excellent, very thorough 15th-century course with Theodore Karp. We examined, among other things, the complete surviving works (there aren&apos;t many) of Johannes Ciconia, an obscure figure who, I became convinced, was the first great composer, the first to realize a lot of things you could do in music that you couldn&apos;t do in any other art form. (Also author of a theoretical treatise doubtless known to others here.) By comparison, Machaut was just a poet who knew a few counterpoint rules.

Of course, we didn&apos;t discuss his Nova Musica and De Proportionibus, which contain a few sections of interest to tuning theorists.
