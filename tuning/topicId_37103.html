I am going to give a critique, but it is only my view, as th earticle<br/>is hers. It is lengthy, but I hope that the length is justified by the<br/>material under discussion.</p><p>First of all, her article is polemical. I am surprised that it managed to be<br/>peer-reviewed into PNM, but there we go. Controversy is something that has<br/>to be courted. I am no stranger to that. Still, if controversial statements<br/>are allowed to be made, equally controversial statements may be made in<br/>reply. (No offence to those who chose not to post, but I feel that even the<br/>article in PNM deserves rougher treatment than some think necessary - let us<br/>not toss something in the bin lightly when it should be hurled with great<br/>force.)</p><p>Let us take the &apos;simple, essential truths&apos; and see what we make of them:</p><p>&apos;whereas the pure intervals are the correct ones, are truly consonant, and<br/>must be better to listen to.&apos;</p><p>Werntz states this as a preamble to the much-trumpeted view that in some way<br/>just intervals (in the sense of ratios of small integers), are better than<br/>others and that all music written in an equal temperament is all &apos;unjust&apos;<br/>music and the misjustice has been done to music through the usage of it. Of<br/>course, she decides that pursuit of just intervals is a misnomer as they can<br/>be just as dissonant. I like the fact that she chooses the high prime 13/8<br/>as a &apos;just minor sixth&apos; rather than the more usual 8/5, which is a proper<br/>just minor sixth. Music is about consonance and dissonance, about the<br/>interest and qualities of one against the interest and qualities of the<br/>other. This does not mean that just intonation is about the abolition of<br/>dissonance, but rather that just intervals achieve a greater purity of<br/>dissonance: we behold the massifs of dissonance free from the fog of<br/>temperament, and can appreciate their qualities better.</p><p>Worse still, that paragon of temperament, the piano is used to listen to<br/>intervals that in their context, with the instrument that sounds them, has<br/>little to do with her argument. In addition, the very inharmonicity of this<br/>instrument is bypassed, without regard for the &apos;more faint tenth, twentieth,<br/>etc. partials.&apos; And just how far from 10/8 or 20/16 they may be (and often<br/>are).</p><p>Werntz assumes that the &apos;flaws&apos; of temperament as named by JI musicians,<br/>lies in the temperament -  which is incorrect - and berates these same<br/>people for engendering in composers a /dread of complex ratios/ due to their<br/>&apos;feared incorrectness&apos; that would lead to &apos;restricting oneself to pure<br/>triads or sevenths&apos;. The flaw in temperament is not in any one direction,<br/>not in the ratios, but in the /inexpressible relationships/ that inform<br/>temperament. We cannot obtain a proper interval, and must make do with a<br/>substitute; in 5-limit harmony we can and /must/ hear the augmented 6th as<br/>such, but temperament tempers this and other intervals out, and levels the<br/>augmented and the diminished, until they are the same. Their color is<br/>sacrificed, so to speak.</p><p>Werntz argues that &apos;musical context has enormous significance concerning our<br/>perception of intervals as consonant or dissonant&apos;. While this may be true<br/>for the example she provides, it does not resolve the fact that the interval<br/>is still the same size. The ear skips or &apos;leaps&apos; as Partch puts it, between<br/>the real and the imagined. The context of her example is not of the G sharp<br/>to B, but of the intervals C to G sharp and C to B which are fundamental to<br/>understanding the &apos;dissonance&apos; in the C minor harmonic scale. We /hear/ the<br/>keynote, and it is this that informs the relationships. As for the &apos;jarring&apos;<br/>octaves and fifths, then this is based on comparative dissonance: how many<br/>of us are struck by the dissonant qualities of an octave if placed in the<br/>context of say, Webern? This has nothing to do with intervals in the raw,<br/>but rather that the ear expects one thing: a minor ninth or a major seventh,<br/>and is &apos;jarred&apos; by what is unexpected: the octave, and so the tension flow<br/>collapses. This does not make the interval dissonant, but rather it is<br/>&apos;unwanted&apos;, and undesirables are always ugly and are thus musically<br/>&apos;dissonant&apos;</p><p>Then we have the passage, which I will need to quote at length:</p><p>&apos;it almost goes without saying that just intonation, if truly adhered to in<br/>order to maintain the indisputably simple consonant harmonic language that<br/>is the credo, also limits the composer /stylistically/ to a sparse, simple<br/>triadic idiom&apos;</p><p>I wonder where 11/8 and 7/4 fit into triads? or where the most beautiful and<br/>fantastic sonorities that can be made from other ratios, or where a vast<br/>proportion of non-harmonic but nevertheless *justly tuned* monodic music<br/>fits into this &apos;akkordweltanschauung&apos;?</p><p>And then we find, straight away: &apos;accustomed to playing diatonic music in<br/>equal temperament&apos;. I doubt this, and the &apos;colouristic inflections&apos;, which<br/>are if nothing else /an attempt to render the intervals more faithfully/. A<br/>purer intonation, and more obviously a just one. Perhaps everyone only plays<br/>keyboards these days, or the Werntz assumes this.</p><p>And then there is &apos;[just intonation&apos;s] origin lies in extramusical<br/>ideologies&apos; The extra-musical ideologies of the monochord? The ideologies of<br/>the human voice? I find it incredible that someone would find ideology in<br/>these simple relationships, the medievalists aside, who transplanted an<br/>ideology onto music and not the other way round.</p><p>To follow: &apos;incorrect triad tunings&apos;. This defies commentary, but I will<br/>try. Werntz assumes that the denunciation of 20th century music by Just<br/>intonationalists is a a consequence of the rejection of the just triad. In<br/>other words, because the triad is out of tune, JI people state that all 20th<br/>C music is a failure. That&apos;s a bit like saying that the Mona Lisa is not<br/>great because Leonardo used the wrong shade of green. Great art uses the<br/>materials it has, and greater art fashions new materials for itself. How<br/>else do we interpret the rise of the richness of harmony in Bach but due to<br/>the fashioning of the new materials of chromatic harmony, forgotten since<br/>the days of d&apos;India and Marenzio.</p><p>Next comes &apos;they have emphasised those higher partials which sound the most<br/>unusual to our twelve-note, equal-tempered ears&apos;<br/>!!!!!!!! &lt;please forgive this exclamation&gt;</p><p>Just those intervals which we are /denied/ by the use of equal-temperament!</p><p>If we are to go about &apos;adding pitches&apos;, then surely, what better place to<br/>start, but with those sounds that are simplest in one sense, yet<br/>/unfamiliar/. These new sounds are &apos;interesting&apos;, without resorting to<br/>artificial divisions of the musical space that Werntz suggests.</p><p>As for &apos;making pieces interesting&apos;, I can say for certain that some<br/>microtonal ET scales make for very interesting music, but that, ultimately,<br/>is not what we seek: we are not all &apos;dissonance chasers&apos;, nor do we find the<br/>constant playing of &apos;new&apos; sounds interesting, but rather we prefer the<br/>contrast, the mixing of the startling with the commonplace, of the stark<br/>with the florid or with plainness. These are the components of music, and<br/>too often temperaments of some kinds are eternally &apos;interesting&apos; but offer<br/>no contrast. This is my personal definition of &apos;Tonality&apos;: to contrast and<br/>to blend, to oppose and to combine. Whether it is tones to make chords or<br/>thematic or melodic material (tunes if you wish), or chords to make phrases,<br/>or phrases to make forms.</p><p>Now we come to the Added Pitches section:</p><p>&apos;The choice to add pitches appears to be in general motivated by the<br/>stimulating sound of the new intervallic relationships&apos;</p><p>Back to the formula of &apos;excitement at every tone&apos; again, and yet, what scale<br/>is proposed: 72ET. The one that quite a number of composers and theorists<br/>and performers like because it approximates well to JI. /That it comes<br/>closer to the truth/, perhaps?</p><p>Then Werntz quotes Perle in Serial Composition and Atonality, in one of his<br/>notes (in Werntz, p206, n40): &apos;The &quot;rightness&quot; of a note depends not upon<br/>its possible containment within a preestablished harmonic unit, as it does<br/>in tonality, but upon larger compositional factors whose meaning must be<br/>discovered within the work itself&apos;</p><p>Yet, Perle continues, in the conclusion to Twelve-Tone Tonality, p162:</p><p>&apos;As in modern poetry, &quot;reflexive reference&quot; is entirely relevant and<br/>sufficient only and explanation of an ideal, rather than an actual, musical<br/>condition. ... in atonal music ... there may be normative and<br/>precompositional, as well as reflexive, referential elements.&apos;</p><p>Therefore, as the remainder of Ch 30 from Twelve-Tone Tonality goes on to<br/>show, music always asserts an order, a &apos;Tonality&apos;, independent of the<br/>context of the tones. And so it is with equal temperaments, wherever their<br/>relationships have mathematical or acoustical resonances, through cycles of<br/>intervals or through correspondences with other structures existing<br/>independently of music itself. Schoenberg hoped that his serial &apos;Method&apos;<br/>would &apos;replace those structural differentiations provided formerly by tonal<br/>harmonies&apos;, yet it cannot do this, nor can it be reflexive, as Babbitt and<br/>many others, including Perle, have proved.</p><p>Even so, these preestablished relationships are not often acoustic in<br/>origin: c.f. Chopin Prelude in Eb, which proves that 12ET has gained<br/>functional use through this non-diatonic, yet structural use of its scale.</p><p>But I digress (!)</p><p>Werntz asserts that &apos;/the smaller microintervals must constitute most of the<br/>linear material/&apos; [her italics], yet, with this approach, the very<br/>independence of the tones is sacrificed. Instead, we hear a tone, and a<br/>kaleidoscopic variation of it. No system based on arbitrary combinations of<br/>tones from a serially treated microtonal set, that restricts itself to such<br/>tiny melodic movement, can surely be said to be free. If something is<br/>controlling the usage of the tones, the approach, then that something is the<br/>tonality, not the set of tones. You might as well give up on the set, and<br/>instead concentrate on the small intervals themselves. Another failing of<br/>this schizophrenic approach to microtonality is that it makes no attempt to<br/>understand its materials, the intervals themselves. They are merely &apos;quanta&apos;<br/>without colour or function, applicable in any direction or any combination<br/>(so would a serial approach demand), and yet the examples all show a<br/>completely thematic, linear, small intervalled approach, which, again from<br/>the examples, I see more and more a need for registral space-filling. Which<br/>is not &apos;composition&apos; but merely a fascination for a certain kind of sound<br/>without regard to the larger possibilities, or its integrated use.</p><p>Maneri&apos;s Microtonalism</p><p>Is tonal. Is definitely tonal, as it has &apos;stepwise progressions and a<br/>balanced and artful contour&apos;. I also like the clean, distilled sound of<br/>Webern, and even Sibelius likes major sevenths, as does Janacek, as does<br/>Mahler. As do a great many other composers, whose music, in spite of the<br/>failure to use &quot;stepwise&quot; progressions, is still &apos;artful&apos;.</p><p>The small intervals are, in Manieri&apos;s work, again used in a space-filling<br/>way, and seem to be stylistic rather than &apos;theoretic&apos;, of which the latter<br/>must be the focus of any study of new materials in music. All style must be<br/>stripped from them, else we confuse style with correctness.</p><p>Werntz Microtonalism</p><p>Is serial. And therefore avails itself of serial techniques. Her &apos;String<br/>Trio with Homage to Chopin&quot; is clearly composed with regard to her view that<br/>pitches are &apos;innocent&apos;, and are /not/ &apos;related to each other&apos;, and yet it is<br/>these relationships which are the essence of music, the inherent<br/>relationships of the tone that form tonality. You cannot have innocent tones<br/>and still join them together in &apos;realtionships&apos; and &apos;relate them only to<br/>each other.&apos; If we must do without innocence, then we must do with a<br/>&apos;marriage&apos; instead, and enjoy the relationships of the tones as they exist,<br/>not as we would wish them to be. Incidentally, do you not find that &apos;with<br/>Homage to Chopin&apos;, extraneous, like &apos;Hawaiian with side salad&apos; or &apos;Steak<br/>with onion rings&apos;? Is the music a dish, to which we can add side orders? If<br/>the Chopin is integral, then the title must be integral, lest it be tacked<br/>on and can therefore be easily &apos;untacked&apos;, with no loss to art nor<br/>enjoyment. If we are to make allusion, then best we allow the listener to<br/>recognize it for themselves, than be directed, in neon, to something, whose<br/>whole ethos is, by its very nature, outside that of the music which seeks<br/>&apos;Homage&apos;?</p><p>As for the remainder of Werntz article, Schoenberg again states it best:<br/>&apos;But aesthetics alleges that it has discovered eternal laws&apos; (Harmonielehre,<br/>Trans Roy Carter, n, p34)</p><p>In conclusion</p><p>I find nothing in Werntz to suggest that her &apos;rudimentary&apos; &apos;issues&apos; are<br/>pertinent to microtonalism. All we have is one composer&apos;s response to an<br/>aesthetic, a response which itself is also an aesthetic. The whole point of<br/>microtonalism is not the &apos;new notes&apos; nor the &apos;purer relationships&apos;; for in<br/>time we will seek to make the former &apos;old&apos; and the latter &apos;impure,&apos; and both<br/>with the instrument of temperament. The need for these extra notes is in the<br/>more sophisticated relationships that can be formed, and the deeper<br/>understanding of the &apos;nature of the tone&apos; that results. We must seek to<br/>bring forth &apos;only that which is in the notes&apos;, as Mahler says. All we need<br/>to do now, is discover /which notes/.</p><p>MG</p></div><h3><a id=37111 href="#37111">ðŸ”—</a>jonszanto &#x3C;JSZANTO@ADNC.COM&#x3E;</h3><span>5/28/2002 3:07:43 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Mark,</p><p>I found that I will have to go to one of the university libraries, as today I went to the central City library and they ended PNM subscription 20 years ago.

The opening paragraph of her paper stated quite clearly that she did not believe either just intonation or exotic tunings provided convincing rationales for microtonal composition; she obviously would like to see music made in fewer ways than people like to make it.</p><p>&gt; hopefully, her articles will be helpful for<br/>&gt; those beginning along a similar aesthetic path as that she has<br/>&gt; tread.</p><p>Promoting her own aesthetic while denigrating others through wrong information and differences in personal preference?
