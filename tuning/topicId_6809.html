As a short preface, I hope that<br/>everyone on the list can grasp the *extremely* wide variety of performing<br/>scenarios involved in the word &quot;music&quot;! What is appropriate to jazz may not<br/>be to classical, Sousa marches vs. Javanese gamelan. IT GOES WITHOUT SAYING<br/>(though I have to say it) that I *expect* a rendition of Mingus&apos; &quot;Goodbye,<br/>Pork Pie Hat&quot; to include improvisation and arrangement; I *don&apos;t* expect<br/>extended solos in a middle-period Beethoven quartet. I am tending, as<br/>should be obvious, to be directing my comments to composed (probably<br/>Western classical) works, as opposed to melody-and-chord chart lead sheets.</p><p>Yeesh.</p><p>Back to the tarmac. To whit:</p><p>[JdL, TD 431.8:]</p><p>&gt;Is your finger pointed at me, Jon?</p><p>Dear John, I&apos;m not pointing fingers but discussing broad issues that people<br/>support or reject (or ignore or are bored with). You certainly don&apos;t see<br/>things the way I do.</p><p>&gt;but I think I&apos;ve also been careful to make the point that it&apos;s impossible<br/>&gt;to know what the original composer would think</p><p>And I would choose to make *any* performance assumptions based on their own<br/>body of work, the period in which the music was composed, similar<br/>performance practices, and the like. If the effort is made for the purpose<br/>of examining the composer&apos;s thrust of the piece, in a sincere and<br/>intelligent (and heartfelt) way, there can be great value. If pieces are<br/>operated on for ear candy, for raw material in service of some historically<br/>unsupportable hypothesis, I find that not of value and disrespectful. It<br/>may be impossible to know, but there are *lots* of evidential parameters<br/>that can be examined - if one cares to.</p><p>&gt;Presumptuous?  I will accept &apos;audacious&apos;, but your choice of words<br/>&gt;illustrates the stark difference in our feelings about messing with<br/>&gt;existing works</p><p>You state that it is impossible to know a composer&apos;s intent, and therefore<br/>you substitute your own alterations. You are presuming to know what is<br/>right, better, or preferable in this case. I find that ... not good.</p><p>&gt; &gt;To reiterate: there are large areas of the musical landscape that are<br/>&gt; &gt;ripe for plucking (and retuning, and rearranging, etc.), but I have yet<br/>&gt; &gt;to see even one of the proponents actively acknowledge the existence of<br/>&gt; &gt;musics/performance works that stand *on their own*, without<br/>&gt; &gt;&apos;improvement&apos;.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;Does it have to be one or the other?  I don&apos;t think it does.</p><p>There have even been composers _here_on_the_list_ that have stated similar<br/>views as mine with regard to their own music. Are you actually proposing<br/>that they have no right to ask for people to respect their aesthetic and<br/>compositional choices and decisions? That you refuse to allow for a musical<br/>creation that has already been thought about to the point of not applying a<br/>third-party&apos;s &quot;improvements&quot;?</p><p>&gt; &gt;Really now, it is a hell of a lot easier to draw muso-strokes by saying<br/>&gt; &gt;&quot;J. S. Bach, arranged by Josephine Blow&quot; than it is to come up with a<br/>&gt; &gt;composition on your own.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;Is it?  I&apos;m not sure that&apos;s true.  And if it is, so what?  Does that<br/>&gt;make one valid, one invalid?</p><p>I&apos;m not saying that arrangements are invalid, but that they must be<br/>examined in a larger context, as well as stating that there are pieces that<br/>don&apos;t need your help. And having done a lot of composition AND<br/>arrangements, it is my feeling that pulling an entirely new musical life<br/>out of the aether is tougher than tweaking someone else&apos;s notes. Your<br/>mileage may vary.</p><p>&gt; &gt;To state that all composers would welcome your contributions to their<br/>&gt; &gt;compositional experiments is disingenuous and rude.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;Has anyone actually made that claim?</p><p>Well, John, you don&apos;t exclude anyone from revisionism, so either you think<br/>they would all love your adjustments to their hard work, or you don&apos;t give<br/>a damn what they would think. Or some sliding percentage of those twin<br/>demons. In essence, *you* are making that claim.</p><p>&gt;However, I<br/>&gt;would at the same time support some other arranger&apos;s &quot;right&quot; to tinker<br/>&gt;with even the works of someone who asked that it not be done, even if I<br/>&gt;personally believed the attempt completely wrong-headed (copyrights and<br/>&gt;original composer&apos;s lifetime exempted, as I&apos;ve stated).</p><p>I see no reason why someone dying should lead to such an unfortunate and<br/>inconsiderate situation. It&apos;s as if you propose an &quot;Ambulance-Chasers<br/>Arrangers Guild&quot;. And John, really, this last paragraph of yours ends it<br/>for me: it is so at odds with what I believe the human creative spirit is<br/>about that we should just not discuss it any further. It saddens me.</p><p>&gt;It is my hope, as I continue to try to refine my methods, to have a<br/>&gt;group of people with whom to share.  Perhaps I&apos;ve picked the wrong<br/>&gt;group?</p><p>I would propose that this is *just* the kind of group. If you shared only<br/>with like-minded individuals, important elements of the debate would go<br/>entirely unrepresented. And these are things that you *must* think about.</p><p>Respectfully,<br/>Jon<br/>&grave;&apos;&grave;&apos;&grave;&apos;&grave;&apos;&grave;&apos;&grave;&apos;&grave;&apos;&grave;&apos;&grave;&apos;&grave;&apos;&grave;&apos;&grave;&apos;&grave;&apos;&grave;&apos;&grave;&apos;&grave;&apos;&grave;&apos;&grave;&apos;&grave;&apos;&grave;&apos;&grave;&apos;&grave;&apos;&grave;&apos;&grave;&apos;&grave;&apos;&grave;&apos;&grave;&apos;&grave;&apos;&grave;&apos;&grave;&apos;&grave;&apos;&grave;&apos;&grave;&apos;&grave;<br/>    Jonathan M.

But isn&apos;t it striking that so many other genres of music DO<br/>encourage improvisation, rearrangement, etc.?  How, and importantly<br/>WHEN, did classical music become subject to this rigidified attitude?</p><p>&gt;If pieces are operated on for ear candy, for raw material in service of<br/>&gt;some historically unsupportable hypothesis, I find that not of value<br/>&gt;and disrespectful.</p><p>&quot;Ear candy?&quot;  What&apos;s that supposed to mean, other than an attempt to<br/>dismiss another&apos;s sense of what is beautiful?</p><p>&quot;Disrespectful&quot;?  In music, the ultimate disrespect for a piece is to<br/>wall it up in rigid requirements until it dies.  I fear that this is<br/>precisely what is happening to classical music today.</p><p>&gt;It may be impossible to know, but there are *lots* of evidential<br/>&gt;parameters that can be examined - if one cares to.</p><p>I&apos;m still waiting for word that, say, 19th century composers actually<br/>stated that they didn&apos;t want their work tinkered with, and for word that<br/>I&apos;m wrong in stating that they themselves drew freely upon whatever<br/>interested them in the pursuit of their own vision.

Anything else is a useless distraction, IMHO.  The two<br/>are very distinct categories of subject.</p><p>&gt;And these are things that you *must* think about.</p><p>Another statement couched in absolutist terms!  Sheesh!</p><p>Jon, my love for music is my guide.  I may be totally misguided; time<br/>will tell.  Trash does not last; can we at least agree on that?  I am<br/>very sorry that you feel I am &quot;presumptuous&quot; and all other words you<br/>have chosen to level against me.  I will continue to do what I do<br/>because your negative judgement means less to me than my own vision,<br/>whether misguided or not.  But I must confess that I&apos;m having a hard<br/>time visualizing making another joyous posting of some new arrangement<br/>that I think truly lovely, knowing that there are those who, without<br/>even listening, have decided that some sense of musical duty compels<br/>them to condemn it.</p><p>JdL</p></div>
