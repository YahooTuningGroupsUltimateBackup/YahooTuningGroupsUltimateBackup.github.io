TUNING!<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Keenan<br/>&gt;</p><p>I agree completely.  This path only opened in a (unfortunately) long discussion<br/>trying to reconcile the meaning of modulation.  I&apos;m trying to keep my words<br/>specific to music and tuning in a pragmatic sense, but there&apos;s a push to include<br/>very far reaching ideas within &quot;modulation&quot; and I have the obsessively optimistic<br/>view thata distiction can be made, and then some sort of useful music-tuning<br/>discussion can happen in relation to the idea of &quot;modulation&quot; whereas there<br/>previously was a lot of defensiveness and arguments getting nowhere.</p><p>I hope everyone realizes that music cannot be completely isolated from life<br/>and philosophy.  But we absolutely need to draw the line when there is no more<br/>music/tuning in the discussion.  I&apos;d ask everyone to work with me to make<br/>these distinctions.  As soon as we can distinguish something as outside of<br/>music/tuning, then our discussion of that here is very much uncalled for.</p><p>My point as it relates to music is that we ARE, as people, stuck in a box.<br/>And it should be accepted.  The box is our senses.  We can only understand<br/>and learn what our numerous senses can input and then process.  There<br/>is a lot of indirect learning too, but everything comes through that path.<br/>So must it be in perceiving music, sound, tuning, and modulation.  Therefore,<br/>I try to keep my discussion of music within that boundary, since we can&apos;t<br/>possibly have useful discussion otherwise.  I don&apos;t think there is any value<br/>of time spent here discussing music we cannot sense.  I do think a valuable<br/>part of our discussion here can be about how and whether we sense and<br/>process various musical elements.  Especially, how do my senses, and<br/>mental processes compare and contrast with others, so we can relate<br/>our musical/tuning work to how people can perceive it?</p><p>I wish nobody would deny that all we have are our senses and processing<br/>of that input.  Once we go beyond that, it is a neverending philisophical<br/>blah blah blah.  Sure, it&apos;s easy to just compare math and temperaments,<br/>but once we start talking about the musical output of it all, this stuff<br/>comes up.  Should I just reject all discussion with people who will only<br/>take a limitless enough view that they refuse to discuss music separately<br/>from other ideas about conciousness and existence?</p><p>Anyway, sorry to rant.  Neil, your post really didn&apos;t help reach any sort<br/>of musical goal in any discussion.  It wasn&apos;t appropriate for the forum,<br/>but I&apos;ll take the blame for not killing the philisophical discussion before<br/>it got nearly so far.  Sorry everybody.  If anyone has some suggestions<br/>how to avoid this without giving up discussing the music/tuning related<br/>things that I&apos;m trying to discuss, I really would like the feedback.</p><p> -Aaron</p></div>
