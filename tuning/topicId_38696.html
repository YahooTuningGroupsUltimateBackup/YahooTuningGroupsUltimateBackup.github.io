Ivor thought that the distinction had some merit.<br/>Personally, I think it&apos;s arbitrary, misleading, and not particularly<br/>useful.</p><p>&gt; Hence, his invention of the term &quot;xenharmonics&quot; for everything else.</p><p>The term &quot;xenharmonic&quot; includes tunings such as 5-ET, 7-ET, and 9-ET,<br/>which definitely sound different from 12-ET, but since they contain<br/>no intervals smaller than a semitone, could not be called microtonal.</p><p>--George</p></div><h3><a id=38710 href="#38710">ðŸ”—</a>jdstarrett &#x3C;jstarret@carbon.cudenver.edu&#x3E;</h3><span>7/21/2002 7:59:08 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>&gt; The term &quot;xenharmonic&quot; includes tunings such as 5-ET, 7-ET, and &gt; 9-ET,<br/>&gt; which definitely sound different from 12-ET, but since they contain<br/>&gt; no intervals smaller than a semitone, could not be called microtonal.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; --George</p><p>Another nice term for otherly tuned is &quot;allotonal&quot; coined by Ken Waushope<br/><a href="http://www.aic.nrl.navy.mil/~wauchope/audio/tuning/">http://www.aic.nrl.navy.mil/~wauchope/audio/tuning/</a></p><p>From Ken&apos;s web page &quot;Allotonality: alternative tunings (allos = other).
