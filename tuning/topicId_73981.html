Thinks he is the reincarnation of Bach,<br/>Tosi and Telemann all at once - at least, he argues from that premise.<br/>The Lehman Principle: Never mind weight of documentary evidence, what<br/>I personally like the sound of on my harpsichord this week is more<br/>likely to be historically correct.</p><p>But what would happen if Brad had set up in 1/4-comma or 1/5-comma<br/>instead? Maybe it would have sounded even better, once the<br/>instrumentalists had adjusted to the more unequal sound world. (Never<br/>underestimate the conditioning of modern ears to 12-ET!)</p><p>The old-ish recording of Schmelzer and Muffat by London Baroque uses<br/>1/4-comma and sounds perfectly fine. The generic problem with saying<br/>&apos;I like the sound of X&apos; is: you don&apos;t know if &apos;Y&apos; would sound even<br/>better. (Example of &apos;Y&apos;: Francois Couperin Prelude no.1, tuned with<br/>F-A, C-E and G-B pure.)</p><p>It is clearly documented that Telemann&apos;s 55-comma system was *not* a<br/>keyboard tuning. (Which is obvious, since it doesn&apos;t accommodate<br/>enharmonic equivalents.) He wrote so himself. It was rather an<br/>approximate model of what singers and violinists were likely to do. To<br/>tune an ordinary harpsichord to 1/6 comma meantone and say without a<br/>blush &apos;This was Telemann&apos;s own tuning&apos; is .. how shall I put it ..<br/>using a loose definition.</p><p>Did Telemann ever actually measure the intonation of any singers or<br/>violinists to find out *how* accurate the model might be? Or was he<br/>satisfied to have found one example of relatively purer intonation<br/>with some size of enharmonic discrepancy?</p><p>Did he actually even calculate that the model, if taken with<br/>mathematical precision, implied rather sharp major thirds and flat<br/>minor ones? (Sorge did later...) How much mathematics does it take to<br/>get from Telemann&apos;s theoretical description to find out just how flat<br/>one ought to tune every fifth? What harpsichordist would bother with<br/>such calculations?</p><p>If one *does* deviate adaptively from a given meantone, it becomes<br/>practically adaptive JI, and the semitones and tones of the melodic<br/>parts no longer follow the supposedly &apos;correct&apos; intervallic ratios of<br/>the model. Tosi said his semitone distinction was only useful when<br/>singing with string orchestra accompaniment - where no such meantone<br/>model can or need apply - with a keyboard, there was no point in<br/>trying to observe it. Brad has, inadvertently, proved the opposite of<br/>his intended point: 1/6-comma is a temperament for keyboard<br/>instruments, not a tuning for melody instruments.</p><p>Yes, 1/6 comma *is* a reasonable keyboard tuning for some 18th century<br/>music - now Telemann was quite some time after the 17th century and<br/>Tosi&apos;s salad days, and also quite some time post-Werckmeister.</p><p>Werckmeister in the 1690&apos;s is the first person in the modern era to<br/>try and argue that thirds ought be more out of tune than fifths - an<br/>essential feature of 1/6 comma, and all points towards ET. If you<br/>accept this then circular tuning becomes simple, almost trivial.</p><p>The problem with believing that anyone was musically accustomed to<br/>anything like 1/6-comma in the 17th century is that the great majority<br/>of practical keyboard tuning instructions from that time result in<br/>something between 1/4- and 1/5-comma: privileging thirds over fifths.<br/>If you believe that Brad&apos;s &apos;deductions&apos; from Tosi apply that far back,<br/>you have to disbelieve Denis, Mersenne, Praetorius, all the simple and<br/>easily applicable instructions that lead to pure thirds and extend<br/>well into the 18th century in some countries.</p><p>Concerning the 17th century, we have a conflict. On the one hand, some<br/>theories, or brief references to them, which are supposed to define<br/>and explain an entire meantone system by referring to a difference<br/>between diatonic and chromatic semitones. If given the full rigid<br/>mathematical treatment, their thirds turn out more mistuned than their<br/>fifths. But the sources themselves never once tell you straight out<br/>how to tune a fifth or a third. Most of them never even mention<br/>temperament or keyboard tuning.</p><p>On the other hand, some keyboard tuning instructions which tell you<br/>how to tune the fifths and the thirds, and the octaves too, and even<br/>in what order to play the keys to get your tuning sequence logical and<br/>correct. They also say clearly that the thirds are perfect, or at most<br/>about as mistuned as the fifths.</p><p>Both *cannot* be realistic descriptions of the same intonational<br/>practice. If keyboards were routinely tuned to 1/4-to-1/5-comma, there<br/>is no point to considering the exact melodic implications of such and<br/>such a theory of semitones - it would simply be unnecessarily out of<br/>tune with the keyboard, with the general-bass and with the harmony.</p><p>(But incorrect theory, such as trying to think of nine commas, is no<br/>obstacle to excellent practice among singers and instrumentalists who<br/>use their ears.)</p><p>The question is quite simple: Who gets more share of the purity, the<br/>third or the fifth. Brad says that, so far as there was a conflict,<br/>the fifth always got the advantage. I disagree and bring up a host of<br/>17th century keyboard tuning instructions in which the third was<br/>either favoured, or shared the prize equally. I argue further that 1/4<br/>comma is clearly the best framework if one wants to have the least<br/>trouble in getting close to pure major and minor triads.<br/>I also say the first person to say that the fifth should be favoured<br/>was Werckmeister, and I suspect that he was the vanguard of a new<br/>trend which valued modulatory freedom over pure harmonic intonation.</p><p>If anyone has the relevant quotation from Musurgia Universalis, I&apos;d be<br/>happy to consider it.</p><p>Previous discussion on HPSCHD-L came to the point that Kircher was<br/>more likely to have been considering 53-division, which has very<br/>nearly pure thirds and fifths and is not meantone at all.

With all this energy wasted making up ludicrous straw-man<br/>&quot;Lehman Principles&quot; and other complaints about a fictitiously stupid<br/>&quot;Brad&quot; who allegedly believes impossible things, we&apos;re losing focus on<br/>the material.  There are some other good points interleaved with it,<br/>but the vitriol against the straw-Lehman chokes them out.</p><p>Take a look at the _New Grove_ pages about regular 17th century<br/>temperaments, and the prevalence of non-1/4-comma layouts.  Lindley&apos;s<br/>article here even cites a presentation of the 55-division from as<br/>early as 1626!

Just nudge the designated 5ths/4ths slightly off<br/>pure by the single or double amounts, with the tuning lever, with<br/>taste and experience.  Yes, I believe it *worked out* to something in<br/>the 1/6 and 1/12 comma range, in result, but the conceptual model here<br/>is tasteful nudges on the tuning lever, not calculation or counting of<br/>anything.</p><p>Brad Lehman (the real one, not a straw construction)</p><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;Tom Dent&quot; &lt;stringph@...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I am continually surprised at Brad&apos;s capacity for exaggeration...<br/>&gt; though I guess I shouldn&apos;t be.
