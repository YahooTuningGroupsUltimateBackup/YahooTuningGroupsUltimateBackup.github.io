And its not just humans,<br/>all animals with vocal chords have some sort of communication<br/>that is based on a harmonic instrument. A way of decoding the<br/>information from such sounds would seem to also want to have<br/>special aparattus for &apos;ripping&apos; harmonic sounds. I know that<br/>&apos;makes sense&apos; is not the same as scientific evidence, but...</p><p>Regarding those fascinating animals with the little brains...<br/>A line I remember with fondness from an aquarium visit was,<br/>&quot;because the pink sea slug is both male and female and canibal,<br/>when two meat on the ocean floor, the possibilities are endless&quot;.</p><p>I did some computer music research with neural nets and was<br/>very adept at creating creatures who, no matter what the input<br/>stimulous, could find the most boring note and repeat it over<br/>and over. I guess its an attitude thing, maybe if I&apos;d just<br/>listened to it another couple of hours...</p><p>Bob Valentine</p></div>
