Very busy performing,<br/>teaching...  I just come back from a Japan tour, during which we played a<br/>new piece by Laurent Martin, French composer, for two quarter tone fretted<br/>guitars and Japanese female traditional singer. Her natural microtonal<br/>fluctuations did fit the quarter tone harmony in a most wonderful way. The<br/>piece had great success with the audience in eight big cities all over<br/>Japan. For me it was the occasion to add another set of twelve frets to my<br/>guitar with movable frets. This gives interesting possibilities since from<br/>now on I can cover any ET from 0 up to 24 as far as straight fret lines are<br/>concerned and still have the possibility to set each fret individually for<br/>each string. I&apos;m looking forward studying some more 19-tet and explore the<br/>22-tet.</p><p>I have a question: in February 2003 I&apos;ll participate in two concerts in<br/>Amsterdam with the Nieuw Ensemble. On the program two pieces by Carrillo:<br/>his well known Prelude to Colon and another short piece for the same singer<br/>and instruments, called I Think of You, for which I realised a conventional<br/>score from Carrillo&apos;s number notation. So we&apos;re looking for the 96-tet harp.<br/>Can anyone give a suggestion how to find such an instrument within the<br/>borders of Europe? 97 metal strings, going from C to C&apos; (one octave higher)<br/>in 1/16th tone steps. That&apos;s *all* we need. Is there perhaps an electronic<br/>solution? Thanks for any help which might lead to a solution.</p><p>Wim Hoogewerf</p></div><h3>Afmmjr@aol.com</h3><span>12/17/2002 9:52:19 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Hi Wim,</p><p>I do know that Skip has Buzz Kimball&apos;s instrument and can send it for the<br/>concert.   I gave Skip LaPlante the telephone number in France for Rudiger&apos;s<br/>microtonal harp (which can play the piece).</p><p>E-mail me privately if you have trouble getting in touch with Skip.</p><p>best, Johnny Reinhard</p></div><h3>Alison Monteith &#x3C;alison.monteith3@which.net&#x3E;</h3><span>12/18/2002 11:39:13 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Wim Hoogewerf wrote:</p><p>&gt; Hello,<br/>&gt; sorry first of all for hiding such a long time.
