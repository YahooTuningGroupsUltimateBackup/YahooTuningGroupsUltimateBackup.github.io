Occasionally when there are not enough patent vals I use the long form and give the normal val list.

Anyway, it gives the first favored edos as<br/>&gt;&gt; 2,4,7,9,12,14,17,19,22,24,27,29,31,34,36,39. Does this set seem<br/>&gt;&gt; reasonable?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Probably not.<br/>&gt; 34-EDO and 19-EDO both temper out 15625/15552 -- i.e. in both of them, the<br/>&gt; nearest interval to 3/1 is 6 times larger than the nearest interval to 6/5.<br/>&gt; That means that both of them can be used as for &quot;hanson temperament&quot;. You<br/>&gt; could also say this about 53-EDO or 72-EDO.<br/>&gt; OTOH, 12-EDO cannot be used for hanson since the nearest interval to 3/1 is<br/>&gt; one step larger than 6 minor thirds.<br/>&gt; This means that you get hanson by combining temperaments like 19&amp;34 or 34&amp;53<br/>&gt; or 53&amp;72 but not 19&amp;12.<br/>&gt; If you combine 19&amp;12, you get meantone, because in both of these, the<br/>&gt; interval closest to 5/1 is 4 times larger than the interval closest to<br/>&gt; 3/2 -- i.e. they both temper out 81/80.<br/>&gt; The obvious thing worth noting here is that a 2D temperament is not defined<br/>&gt; by an unique pair of EDOs -- for example, 19&amp;31 also gives you meantone and<br/>&gt; 31&amp;50 as well.<br/>&gt; In contrast, the vanishing interval is still 81/80 and there&apos;s only one such<br/>&gt; interval there (unless you want to include its integer powers like 6561/6400<br/>&gt; or some such).</p><p>The nice thing about labels like &quot;19&amp;31&quot; or &quot;31&amp;50&quot; is that they clear up any ambiguity when you&apos;re trying to extend temperaments like &quot;meantone&quot; to higher limits. They&apos;re the same as 12&amp;19 in 7-limit meantone, but in 11-limit you&apos;ve got 12&amp;31 &quot;meantone&quot; and 19&amp;31 &quot;meanpop&quot; (which includes 31&amp;50). In the 17-limit, the two varieties of &quot;meanpop&quot; (19&amp;31, 31&amp;50) are distinct.</p><p>19&amp;31: [&lt;1 2 4 7 -2 10 2|, &lt;0 -1 -4 -10 13 -15 5|]<br/>31&amp;50: [&lt;1 2 4 7 -2 10 15|, &lt;0 -1 -4 -10 13 -15 -26|]</p><p>The biggest problem is that a few temperaments can&apos;t be labeled this way, or at least not easily. Take these other 17-limit versions of meanpop for instance:</p><p>[&lt;1 2 4 7 -2 2 2|, &lt;0 -1 -4 -10 13 4 5|]<br/>[&lt;1 2 4 7 -2 10 7|, &lt;0 -1 -4 -10 13 -15 -7|]</p><p>While not a huge problem in 7-limit temperaments, it does seem that more of these tend to show up in higher limits. I use a method for labeling these temperaments that adds letter suffixes to the basic ET numbers:</p><p>no suffix - the nearest approximations of all primes<br/>b - a less accurate approximation of prime 3<br/>c - a less accurate approximation of prime 5</p><p>etc.</p><p>for instance, &quot;12&quot; without a suffix represents &lt;12 19 28 34 42 44 49|, but &quot;12e&quot; represents &lt;12 19 28 34 41 44 49|. With these I can label temperaments like those 17-limit versions of meanpop:</p><p>12e&amp;19: [&lt;1 2 4 7 -2 2 2|, &lt;0 -1 -4 -10 13 4 5|]<br/>19g&amp;31g: [&lt;1 2 4 7 -2 10 7|, &lt;0 -1 -4 -10 13 -15 -7|]</p></div><h3><a id=97765 href="#97765">ðŸ”—</a>genewardsmith &#x3C;genewardsmith@...&#x3E;</h3><span>4/9/2011 6:45:40 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;Carl Lumma&quot; &lt;carl@...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Thanks Chris, for pointing out that the problem we&apos;re trying to<br/>&gt; solve is very similar to the one solved by the CAS system.</p><p>When giving names to prescription drugs, chemical names are not used.
