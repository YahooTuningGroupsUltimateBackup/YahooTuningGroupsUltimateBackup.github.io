Essentially he says what I was saying in<br/>my little lecture at the Moscow Conservatory, except he seems to be<br/>saying it better and much earlier.... oh well.</p><p>Here it is, in an interview with Robert Craft:</p><p>Robert Craft: Is any musical element still susceptible to<br/>radical exploitation and development?</p><p>Igor Stravinsky: Yes: pitch. I even risk a prediction that<br/>pitch will comprise the main difference between the<br/>&quot;music of the future&quot; and our music, and I consider that<br/>the most important aspect of electronic music is the fact<br/>that it can manufacture pitch. Our mid-twentieth- century<br/>situation, in regard to pitch, might perhaps be compared<br/>to that of the mid-sixteenth century, when, after Willaert<br/>and other had proved the necessity of equal<br/>temperament, the great pitch experiments<br/>began--Zarlino&apos;s quarter-tone instrument, Vincentino&apos;s<br/>thirty-nine-tones-to-the-octave archicembalo, and others.<br/>These instruments failed, of course, and the<br/>well-tempered clavier was established (though at least<br/>three hundred years before Bach), but our ears are more<br/>ready for such experiments now--mine are, at any rate. I<br/>had been watching the Kuramatengu play in Osaka one<br/>afternoon recently and had become accustomed to the<br/>Noh flute. Later, in a restaurant, I suddenly heard an<br/>ordinary flute playing ordinary (well-tempered) music. I<br/>was shocked, music apart--I think I could keep the music<br/>apart anyway--by the expressive poverty of the tuning.<br/>[Stravinsky, Igor and Robert Craft, Memories and<br/>Commentaries, Doubleday &amp; Co., Inc.
