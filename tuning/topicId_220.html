They seem to be<br/>interested.  I also want to express &quot;feelings&quot; with visual art pieces;<br/>sculpture, paintings, and drawings.  I hope that all viewers always<br/>understand what I am &quot;saying.&quot;  Some understand but, probably, not<br/>everyone. At an exhibition or a concert there are usually so many pieces to<br/>look at or listen to that viewers do not have time to &quot;think&quot; or &quot;feel&quot; the<br/>artists&apos; ways.  Some visual artists want viewers to get their own<br/>&quot;messages&quot; even though different from the artists&apos; messages.     I think<br/>communicating to an audience is just as important as expressing a feeling<br/>or idea in the art pieces (musical or visual).  The likelihood of reaching<br/>everyone in the audience is very small.  If the piece is different from an<br/>individual&apos;s &quot;likes&quot; that individual may not be willing to accept something<br/>different.

Duchamp suggested that art<br/>was something people just do that others sometimes find useful. We should<br/>encourage ourselves and others from becoming nothing more than whores to some<br/>imaginary audience. Yamaguchi who just died said &quot; Weather they notice me or<br/>not I will go ahead and Bloom! The mediocre have plenty &quot;fast food&quot; to feed<br/>on and I&apos;m sure I am like all of you here on this list very hungry for some<br/>real cuisine!<br/>    Thanks Gary for bringing this up as there is an unbalance of the<br/>technical as opposed to the Poetic here on this list.

I&apos;m<br/>afraid that that&apos;s just too general for me.  That gets back to the ol&apos; &quot;if a<br/>tree falls in a forest with nobody around, does make a sound?&quot; question.  My<br/>answer to that is, you bet it makes a sound because sound is strictly a<br/>physical phenomenon, but it doesn&apos;t make music, because music is a perceived<br/>phenomenon.</p><p>   So then, here are three possible expansions on that definition:<br/>1.  Music is a pattern of sound in time intended to express something.<br/>2.  Music is a pattern of sound in time intended to convey some meaning<br/>    to a listener.<br/>3.  Music is a pattern of pitches, harmonies, and rhythms intended to<br/>    convey some meaning to a listener.</p><p>   I personally take definition #2.  I think that conveying a meaning of some<br/>sort to some audience is as fundamentally important to music as making sounds<br/>over time, and as expressing something you feel.</p></div><h3><a id=256 href="#256">ðŸ”—</a>Gary Morrison &#x3C;mr88cet@xxxxx.xxxx&#x3E;</h3><span>1/9/1999 4:43:41 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Gary Morrison wrote:</p><p>&gt; 1.

I&apos;d have to go somewhere between (well, sorta<br/>between!) #2 and #3.  #2 includes speech, screams, and laughter, for example.  I<br/>don&apos;t think I&apos;d call them music.  So I&apos;ll refine that further:2.5:  Music is a<br/>voluntary pattern of sound in time intended to convey<br/>      a nonlinguistic, or not-entirely-linguistic, meaning to a listener.</p></div>
