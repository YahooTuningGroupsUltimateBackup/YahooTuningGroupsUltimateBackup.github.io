If you do<br/>not patent it within 365 days, you give it up forever.<br/>It does not matter what country you publish in either.</p><p>However by publishing and then NOT patenting, you also<br/>prevent big corporations from stealing your idea (though<br/>they will try to do so anyway if your idea has any<br/>commercial value) and of course preserve for posterity the<br/>source of your invention.</p><p>This is why you sometimes get asked to sign a<br/>nondisclosure agreement -- if a inventor shows you his<br/>invention you might be able to later claim that he was<br/>publically publishing his invention and therefore you<br/>could thwart his patent attempts if it is determined that<br/>his talk with you was either a public description or an<br/>offer of sale. So nondisclosure agreements are real<br/>important for your own protection if you have any designs<br/>on possibly licensing or patenting your new tuning method.<br/>If you don&apos;t care about that, then publishing publically<br/>and deliberately not getting a patent is probably the best<br/>way to go. Or you could keep it a &apos;trade secret&apos; and tell<br/>no one the secret tuning methods you are using that is<br/>making your music align peoples chakras, get the energy<br/>unblocked from along their meridians and curing their<br/>diseases. (All of which can be accomplished with the right<br/>tuning &amp; compositional ability.)</p><p>- Jeff</p></div><h3><a id=19975 href="#19975">ðŸ”—</a>jpehrson@rcn.com</h3><span>3/8/2001 8:04:06 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In tuning@y..., &quot;J Scott&quot; &lt;xjscott@e...&gt; wrote:</p><p><a href="/tuning/topicId_19968.html#19968">/tuning/topicId_19968.html#19968</a></p><p>&gt; Hey all,<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I should also mention that if you do invent something like<br/>&gt; a tuning method and then publish an article about it,<br/>&gt; offer it for sale, or even describe it on the tuning list,<br/>&gt; then you have 365 days to apply for a patent.
