As far as being first, isn&apos;t &quot;The Dreamer that remains&quot; the first music video!<br/>IMHO the question as to who did what first is too circumstantial to really mean much. As most<br/>works of art are unique, they all can be considered the first on some level, it all depends on<br/>what someone considers important. Notice such things are always so noun oriented as opposed to<br/>verb. like you don&apos;t hear someone say such and such is the first one to have this type of<br/>change in the texture, or emotional levels.</p><p>Joseph Pehrson wrote:</p><p>&gt; Regarding the Harry Partch discussion that Johnny Reinhard started in TD<br/>&gt; 696:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; Somehow the &quot;authenticity&quot; issue is challenged once again with the following<br/>&gt; &gt; by Harry Partch in the Enclosures series (p.120 from a letter by Partch to<br/>&gt; &gt; Lucie and Larry Marshall).<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I just wanted to mention that as someone fairly closely involved with<br/>&gt; the American Composers Forum in New York and Minnesota, I had the good<br/>&gt; fortune to spend part of an afternoon with Phillip Blackburn going over<br/>&gt; his ORIGINAL Partch scrapbook which he scanned for &quot;Enclosure III.&quot;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Most probably this discussion has taken place on the list before, but it<br/>&gt; occured to me that perhaps the videos that the American Composers Forum<br/>&gt; is doing as the OTHER &quot;Enclosures&quot; -- I and IV, were, perhaps, the<br/>&gt; &quot;real&quot; electronic Partch.  Since, as some of our Partch authorities seem<br/>&gt; to feel (Jon Szanto, Daniel Wolf, Kraig Grady... certainly Drummond)<br/>&gt; that the music shouldn&apos;t be &quot;transcribed&quot; to other instruments, or<br/>&gt; electronic ones, certainly part of the theatrical experience can be<br/>&gt; preserved and disseminated by electronic means through video, etc.<br/>&gt; Could computers and the Internet someday create a &quot;virtual Partch&quot;<br/>&gt; experience that could be transmitted worldwide and also preserve much of<br/>&gt; the theatre??<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; ___________ ____ __ __ _<br/>&gt; Joseph Pehrson<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; ------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>&gt; Failed tests, classes skipped, forgotten locker combinations.<br/>&gt; Remember the good &apos;ol days<br/>&gt; <a href="http://click.egroups.com/1/5531/2/_/239029/_/962939035/">http://click.egroups.com/1/5531/2/_/239029/_/962939035/</a><br/>&gt; ------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; You do not need web access to participate.
