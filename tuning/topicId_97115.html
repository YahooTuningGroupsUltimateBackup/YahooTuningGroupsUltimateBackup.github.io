This group had a large part in my development several years back, leading to where I am now. But it also gets overwhelming, and I&apos;ve been busy considering a return to academia (a whole complex issue, currently debating accepting an offer at a PhD program in ethnomusicology but trying to coordinate with my wife and her options for continued schooling and career).</p><p>I&apos;ll try to pop back in here to check for discussion to answer questions or whatever that might come up, but if you want to be certain I see it, then e-mail me or leave a comment at the blog or on YouTube where the videos are.</p><p>In harmony,<br/>Aaron Wolf</p></div><h3><a id=97117 href="#97117">ðŸ”—</a>ixlramp &#x3C;ixlramp@...&#x3E;</h3><span>3/19/2011 3:11:27 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Tonal Plexus looks like LEGO (I love LEGO!).</p></div>
