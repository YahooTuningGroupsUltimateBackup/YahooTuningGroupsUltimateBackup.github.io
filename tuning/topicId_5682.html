Ustad Mashkoor Khan, one of the greatest living<br/>vocalists of the Kirana lineage, is the grandson of the<br/>illustrious singer Ustad Abdul Karim Khan.  Mashkoor Khan<br/>was trained by his father, sarangi master Ustad Shakur Khan,<br/>who along with Pandit Pran Nath received the highest teachings<br/>from Ustad Abdul Wahid Khan Sahib, the acknowledged master of<br/>the Kirana style in this century.</p><p>Ustad Mashkoor Khan, who has been performing since his boyhood,<br/>has devoted his life to uphold and continue the legacy of this<br/>ancient musical form.  His singing, steeped in the Kirana tradition,<br/>uniquely evokes the character of each raga, captivating the<br/>listener with his power and virtuosity.  Here in New York for<br/>the first time during his second US tour, Ustad Mashkoor Khan<br/>is also a talented teacher and member of the Sangeet Research<br/>Academy in Calcutta.  He has an encyclopedic knowledge of ragas<br/>and compositions.  This is a rare chance to hear him perform<br/>in the serene, meditative environment of the Dream House<br/>before his imminent return to India next week.</p><p>Pandit Pran Nath, who passed away in 1996, virtually<br/>introduced the vocal tradition of North Indian classical<br/>music to the West in 1970.  His 1971 morning performance at<br/>Town Hall, New York City, was the first concert of morning<br/>ragas to be presented in the U.S.  Subsequently, he introduced<br/>and elaborated to Western audiences the concept of performing<br/>ragas at the proper time of day by scheduling entire series<br/>of concerts at special hours.  Many students and professional<br/>musicians came to him in America to learn about the<br/>vast system of raga and to improve their musicianship.<br/>He performed frequently in New York City and in 1972,<br/>established his own school, the Kirana Center<br/>for Indian Classical Music, now a project of MELA Foundation.<br/>In Fall 1993, Pran Nath inaugurated the MELA Foundation Dream<br/>House with three Raga Cycle concerts.<br/>November 3, 1999 would have been his 81st birthday.</p><p>Ustad Mashkoor Khan will be accompanied by Naren Budhakar,<br/>tabla, and by his disciple Michael Harrison, voice and tambura.<br/>Admission is $18.00.</p><p>For further information on Pandit Pran Nath&#xFFFD;s musical legacy,<br/>call 212-925-8270, or see the MELA website:<br/><a href="http://www.virtulink.com/mela/main.htm">http://www.virtulink.com/mela/main.htm</a></p></div>
