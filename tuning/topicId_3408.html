We would never think of playing a Db for a D or<br/>&gt; vice versa because we call these separate names and so we<br/>&gt; should also accept that D and D- are not the same note and<br/>&gt; that they can occur near each other in the same piece.<br/>&gt; This is well understood in Indian music (in practice if not<br/>&gt; in theory).</p><p>This is *exactly* what I was talking about in my long posting<br/>[TD 207.14] where I discuss &apos;musical phonemes&apos;.</p><p>As an example,  The &apos;p&apos; sound in the two words &apos;pat&apos; and &apos;spat&apos;<br/>is actually, phonetically, two different sounds: after the initial<br/>&apos;plosive&apos; created by forcing the lips apart in both sounds,<br/>the first one has a puff of air while the second one does not.</p><p>In many languages of India, these are considered to be two<br/>different letters, and therefore two different words that use<br/>them, respectively, which to us look and sound like the same<br/>word, carry two distinctly different meanings.</p><p>In English, this phonetic distinction does not apply: the<br/>&apos;plain p&apos; and the &apos;p with a puff of air&apos; are always both &apos;p&apos;,<br/>and the sounds are not distinguished by English listeners<br/>because they do not convey any difference in meaning.</p><p>Thus, in English they are both the same phoneme &apos;p&apos;, while<br/>in those Indian languages they are two different phonemes.</p><p>The situation can also be reversed: there are some sounds<br/>that we, as English speakers, know are entirely different,<br/>but speakers of other languages may not distinguish between<br/>them, as the difference conveys no meaning in their language.</p><p>Joseph L.

Perhaps the same applies in<br/>&gt; music sometimes.</p><p>That&apos;s the point.</p><p>And I *do* think there&apos;s a good analogy to musical intonation<br/>here.</p><p>Daniel Wolf pointed out to me that speakers of a certain language<br/>who hear a sound pronounced incorrectly as a result of the person<br/>uttering it not being cognizant of the phonetic/phonemic<br/>distinctions, will recognize it as being incorrect.</p><p>But he made another point which bears further examination:</p><p>[Daniel Wolf, private communication]<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; English orthography happens to combine both sounds in<br/>&gt; one symbol, which is sufficient, since the aspirated form<br/>&gt; only occurs in particular contexts not shared with the<br/>&gt; unaspirated form.</p><p>In other words, in general (we who use English as our native<br/>tongue know about spelling exceptions!), a language will find<br/>written symbols for all the distinct phonemes it needs but will<br/>employ an economical means of realizing these distinctions,<br/>sharing symbols for different sounds when it can, i.e, when<br/>there is no possibility for confusion of meaning.</p><p>I feel that it is necessary to state the possibility that this<br/>may be true in only a minority of cases, because I know about<br/>some languages where there is an extremely close correspondence<br/>between the written symbol and the phonetic, such as Finnish.<br/>But based on what I know about linguistics, I believe it<br/>holds for the majority of cases.</p><p>And I do believe that a musical style may dictate intonational<br/>&apos;rules&apos; in the same way that a language dictates phonemic rules,<br/>and that much information may be gained by the application<br/>of these linguistic ideas to a study of intonation.</p><p>Joseph L.
