Or,<br/>perhaps we are at the point where we don&apos;t have to compare tunings to any<br/>historical standard, but designate them by their structure: &quot;I heard a<br/>good band last night. Mostly 22tet country and eastern, but they played<br/>some 7 limit heavy metal neo-raga too. The singer was completely<br/>Pythagorean though.&quot;<br/>&#x9;Seriously, between tuning enthusiasts, a nomen for<br/>our collective practice is hardly necessary, as _we_ know what we are<br/>talking about. Do we really need a single term to designate our<br/>non-12tetness to outsiders? We are certainly not monolithic in our tuning<br/>practice. Hell, we can&apos;t even agree on what tuning Bach really really<br/>liked best. Badda-boom ;&gt;P Seriously though, how about &quot;non-standard<br/>tuning&quot;? I like that. It makes sly reference to Abraham Robinson&apos;s<br/>non-standard analysis (infinitesimals, etc.) and it implies only<br/>difference from the norm.</p><p>&#x9;On another note, ahem, Paul E., I am sorry that I don&apos;t have the<br/>time at the moment to take on any more guitar work. Thanks for thinking of<br/>me. I&apos;d be glad to generate a fret placement printout for whoever you<br/>find.</p><p>John Starrett<br/><a href="http://www-math.cudenver.edu/~jstarret/microtone.html">http://www-math.cudenver.edu/~jstarret/microtone.html</a></p></div>
