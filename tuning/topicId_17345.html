It can be a plus if you want to migrate step by step away<br/>&gt;from 12tet music, for example for pedagogical purposes.  If it is not a<br/>&gt;FAQ, why do most of people here prefer JI?</p><p>To my ear, music that stays within a few cents of JI is much more<br/>beautiful than music that succumbs to thirds 14 or 16 cents distant<br/>from JI.  I also find 7-limit dominant 7ths (with the 7th almost 1/3<br/>semitone flatter than 12-tET) to be wonderfully haunting and longing.<br/>They make 12-tET dom 7ths and 5-limit dom 7ths sound like mono,<br/>rather than stereo, to my ears.</p><p>That said, I would not rule out ANY tuning for making great music.<br/>There are many on this list who work far away from JI.</p><p>JdL</p></div>
