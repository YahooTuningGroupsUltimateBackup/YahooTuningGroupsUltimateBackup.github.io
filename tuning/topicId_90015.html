You can tie one end to one of the tuning pegs and the other end to one of the screws anchoring the neck to the body (slightly loosened to expose the shaft, and the tightened down once the fishing line is tied tight).  As long as you wrap it tight, it&apos;ll intonate as well as wire and is a good way of checking the intonation of your measurements.  You can use a razor blade or kitchen knife to make little vertical cuts on the side of the fretboard to act as grooves to hold the fishing line in place, and these cuts will be good landmarks for when you put in the wire.  It takes all of maybe two hours if you have a good ruler in 1/100&quot; scale, possibly less time if you really know what you&apos;re doing.</p><p>HTH!</p><p>-Igs</p><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;christopherv&quot; &lt;chrisvaisvil@...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I just purchased a used Fender Squire strat copy ($60) in order to make a microtonal electric.

A while back I<br/>tried to figure out what was going on, and found the patent at<br/><a href="http://patft.uspto.gov/netacgi/nph-Parser?Sect1=PTO2&Sect2=HITOFF&p=1&u=%2Fnetahtml%2FPTO%2Fsearch-bool.html&r=3&f=G&l=50&co1=AND&d=PTXT&s1=vogt.INNM.&s2=guitar&OS=IN/vogt+AND+guitar&RS=IN/vogt+AND+guitar">http://patft.uspto.gov/netacgi/nph-Parser?Sect1=PTO2&Sect2=HITOFF&p=1&u=%2Fnetahtml%2FPTO%2Fsearch-bool.html&r=3&f=G&l=50&co1=AND&d=PTXT&s1=vogt.INNM.&s2=guitar&OS=IN/vogt+AND+guitar&RS=IN/vogt+AND+guitar</a>.<br/>As best as I can tell, there are slots in the fingerboards with lots<br/>of<br/>screw holes that frets can be screwed into, and the whole fret mechanism has<br/>a little leeway to slide to exact pitch. I think in the first instruments,<br/>you could only deviate a little from 12EDO, but new instruments based off<br/>this design are obviously microtonal (as per John Schneider&apos;s guitar).</p><p>The current owner of the patents (and builder of Schneider&apos;s guitar) is<br/><a href="http://www.geigen-und-gitarren-chouard-freising.de/">http://www.geigen-und-gitarren-chouard-freising.de/</a> , although he<br/>unfortunately doesn&apos;t have a English webpage. It&apos;s understandable with the<br/>google translation, anyways. There&apos;s also a Turkish luthier who has built a<br/>guitar based off this technology: <a href="http://www.tolgahancogulu.com/">http://www.tolgahancogulu.com/</a>.</p><p>I&apos;d really like a guitar built like this. Tuning at each fret seems like<br/>it&apos;d improve on the accuracy of even the most careful traditional fretting,<br/>and of course you could change tunings if you wanted to (though obviously<br/>not very quickly). I&apos;m wondering if the maker would sell the fretboard<br/>components for the purpose of retrofitting -- a full custom classical guitar<br/>isn&apos;t inexpensive, unfortunately.</p><p>On Wed, Jun 9, 2010 at 8:04 AM, john777music &lt;jfos777@...&gt; wrote:</p><p>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Hi Chris,<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I modified a guitar to make it microtonal in 2007 (you can see a photo of<br/>&gt; it at <a href="http://www.johnsmusic7.com">www.johnsmusic7.com</a>).
