In other words, I wasted my life.&quot;<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; Dan<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; At dinner once in Middletown, Ct., the audio artist Doug Kahn repeated this<br/>&gt; quote to John Cage.  Mr. C., without missing a beat,  replied that Schaeffer<br/>&gt; &quot;should have tried continuing further on up the scale.&quot;</p><p>Yes it is likewise a shame that his cultural background possibly blinded him to the vast world<br/>music that is not based on DoReMi. Very successful music at that. It seems &quot;progress&quot; in music<br/>at this point is not so much in a continued &quot;evolution&quot;,  but in a &quot;widening&quot; in the<br/>recognition of the human musical compass already here. Against the &quot;experimental&quot; failures of<br/>the 60&apos;s, we have only to loosen the borders that separate us from our neighbors.<br/>-- Kraig Grady<br/>North American Embassy of Anaphoria island<br/><a href="http://www.anaphoria.com">www.anaphoria.com</a></p></div>
