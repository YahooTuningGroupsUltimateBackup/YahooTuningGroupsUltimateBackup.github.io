Been away a while.  Still studying and writing and practicing and planning<br/>and singing barbershop, and looking to change the frets on my guitar and my Stick...</p><p>Anyway, I *finally* updated from my old OS9 imac and got a new G5 iMac and the latest OS<br/>X.  I know that back when I was more involved there were lots of tools I couldn&apos;t use<br/>because I didn&apos;t have OS X.  Now I do.  And I assume things may have changed a bit too.</p><p>I bought Digital Performer, partly for its now built-in, adjustable, easy pitch control of<br/>audio recordings.  I haven&apos;t got into using it yet.  I don&apos;t know if it has easy MIDI or audio<br/>pitch libraries like Logic supposedly has, but anyway, DP is what I&apos;ve got.<br/>I also got the latest Finale.</p><p>Aside from that, all I&apos;ve got is JI Calc that can run under classic still.</p><p>Is there something like JI Calc but better?  Ideally that can send tuning signals through OS<br/>X&apos;s MIDI stuff to my keyboard?  More responsive hopefully?  Just as adjustable?</p><p>How about tips for DP or Finale JI and alt work?  What other tools should I get?</p><p>How about analysis?  Mac the Scope looks good... I really have no experience with stuff<br/>like that though and I&apos;ve got a low budget.  It&apos;d be nice to be able to identify the harmonic<br/>(or inharmonic) content of both solo and ensemble recordings...  I don&apos;t really need other<br/>sorts of analysis though...</p><p>Thanks!</p><p>-Aaron Wolf</p></div><h3><a id=61394 href="#61394">ðŸ”—</a>Carl Lumma &#x3C;clumma@yahoo.com&#x3E;</h3><span>10/13/2005 9:45:21 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Hi Aaron!
