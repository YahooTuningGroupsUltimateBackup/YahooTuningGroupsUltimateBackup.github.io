I am quite<br/>serious about this; it does everything that I expect good music to do.  I&apos;m<br/>writing because it so often doesn&apos;t get taken seriously.</p><p>Barbershop combines the calming and beneficial qualities of beatless tuning<br/>with the intellectual rush of western polyphony.  It combines the enhanced<br/>musical bandwidth of the 7-limit with all the desirable properties of the<br/>diatonic scale, and to some extent with the 12-tone Pythagorean MOS.  Being<br/>jazz, it has plenty of good rhythms and exotic harmonic movement.  Being<br/>choral music, it often has lyrics.  Being four-part, it is flexible to<br/>write for and a joy to listen to (as a composer, I find 4-part writing<br/>perhaps my favorite).  As a singer, I find the barbershop technique a<br/>fulfillment of the vocal medium.  And as Erv Wilson and I once agreed,<br/>there is hardly a sound more desirable than the sound of the human voice.</p><p>It is the concept of Barbershop that I think often throws people off.  And<br/>it is concept-rich.  In fact, it achieves for me greater power of concept<br/>than any &quot;conceptualist&quot; music I know of.  And a better concept I could not<br/>ask for.  I tend to look at barbershop tunes as 20th century madrigals.<br/>They offer a unique view at the roots of Jazz.  They are often surprisingly<br/>sexually explicit, but in a completely wholesome way.  It&apos;s so refreshing<br/>to find music so benevolent.</p><p>Participating in Barbershop has been a whole lot of fun.  Nothing has been<br/>better for my ear, or my voice.  And you get to meet these sweet guys,<br/>married for 50 years and with big white curly mustaches.  These guys are real!</p><p>Carl</p></div><h3><a id=258 href="#258">ðŸ”—</a>aloe@xxx.xxx</h3><span>1/9/1999 10:23:20 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>At 11:20 AM 1/9/99 -0500, Carl Lumma wrote:</p><p>&gt;Barbershop combines the calming and beneficial qualities of beatless tuning<br/>&gt;with the intellectual rush of western polyphony.</p><p>&gt;Being four-part, it is flexible to<br/>&gt;write for and a joy to listen to (as a composer, I find 4-part writing<br/>&gt;perhaps my favorite).</p><p>Have there been compositions for Barbershop quintet, or do the Beach Boys<br/>hold a patent on 5-part vocal harmony?</p><p>--Charlie Jordan &lt;<a href="http://www.rev.net/~aloe/music">http://www.rev.net/~aloe/music</a>&gt;</p></div>
