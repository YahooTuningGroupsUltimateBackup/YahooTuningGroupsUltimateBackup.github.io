On the other hand, I think a lot of the &quot;just&quot; music I have<br/>heard since becoming involved in this tuning odyssey leaves a lot to be<br/>desired in terms of musical quality(and of course, there is certainly<br/>great music in pure tunings). My feeling has been that for many tuning<br/>folks, their command of theory far exceeds their musical abilities...as<br/>I&apos;ve always suggested, a lot of practice and study on one&apos;s instrument<br/>is not a bad idea. To quote the late, great Ivor Darreg from the Feb<br/>1978 issue of Guitar Player: &quot;We have had several centuries of profound<br/>theoretical writings, but precious little to hear.&quot; Amen to that...and<br/>Pat, why would you want to say such an inflammatory thing in the first<br/>place? It just creates bad feelings, and serves no real purpose other<br/>than to make folks think that you have a ways to go before you really<br/>understand the deeper meanings of music and art. The real masters I have<br/>met, such as Erv Wilson, Johnny Reinhard, Ivor Darreg, John<br/>Schneider...they are more interested in the quality of the music, rather<br/>than the decimal points of a tuning system...it&apos;s not a bad lesson to<br/>learn, and I hope you and others like you eventually learn it...needless<br/>provocation is a waste of time for all...it gets old seeing such small<br/>minded commentary on a list such as this; we need to be talking about<br/>more important things...Hstick</p></div>
