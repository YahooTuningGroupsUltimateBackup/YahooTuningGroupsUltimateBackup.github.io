is an educated guess,<br/>however informed.</p><p>Such a guess will be informed not only by the writings of that era,<br/>but by our own musical experiences with compositions and styles from<br/>this era, and maybe also related improvisations or compositions in<br/>styles inspired by 13th-14th century practice.</p><p>At the same time, in approaching this question, I&apos;m aware that not<br/>everything I happen personally to like very much in the intonation of<br/>this music was necessarily practice during the era, although a<br/>theorist like Marchettus of Padua may give valuable clues about<br/>flexible pitch ensembles in some localities and epochs.</p><p>To say that flexible-pitch ensembles may generally have followed a<br/>&quot;Pythagorean&quot; type of intonation is obviously not to say that the<br/>elementary intervals of the system were tuned precisely at 2:1, 3:2,<br/>4:3, and 9:8, nor that more complex intervals such as major and minor<br/>thirds were always tuned precisely at 81:64 and 32:27.</p><p>The variability of human vocal intonation, not to speak of possible<br/>contextual factors pulling a note or sonority in one direction or<br/>another, would preclude such an unlikely interpretation.</p><p>However, the argument for a generally Pythagorean-like intonation<br/>follows three basic lines:</p><p>          (1) Pythagorean is an excellent tuning for the various<br/>              modes or octave species of medieval monophony and<br/>              polyphony, with its generous 9:8 whole-tones around<br/>              204 cents, and its compact diatonic semitones at<br/>              256:243, around 90 cents;</p><p>          (2) Pythagorean nicely fits the vertical parameters of<br/>              style, with pure concords of 2:3:4 or 3:4:6, and<br/>              also relatively concordant sonorities at 4:6:9 or<br/>              6:8:9, for example; rather complex thirds and sixths<br/>              nicely resolving cadentially to stable concords; and<br/>              a rich spectrum of concord/discord fitting the subtle<br/>              theory of the period;</p><p>          (3) Pythagorean, while providing a regular tuning structure,<br/>              neatly fits the 14th-century ideal of &quot;closest approach&quot;<br/>              resolutions (e.g. m3-1, M3-5, M6-8, m7-5, M2-4) where<br/>              the unstable interval resolves by contrary motion as<br/>              efficiently as possible to its stable goal -- the total<br/>              motion being equal to a 32:27 minor third, or about<br/>              294 cents.</p><p>We can cite various kinds of medieval statements on these points, for<br/>example the use of the _minor_ semitone at 256:243 as the &quot;singable&quot;<br/>one -- in contrast to Renaissance theorists who tell us that the<br/>_major_ semitone is the singable (or more usually sung) one.</p><p>We can also cite the graduated scales of concord/discord in the 13th<br/>century, the &quot;closest approach&quot; doctrine of the 14th and early 15th<br/>centuries, and the taste expressed by theorists for &quot;fully perfected&quot;<br/>major thirds and sixths at 81:64 (~408 cents) and 27:16 (~906 cents),<br/>which expand most efficiently to stable fifths and octaves<br/>respectively.</p><p>However, this is theory -- at best, an approximate model, given the<br/>kind of variability that singers and flexible pitch instrumentalists<br/>find at once unavoidable and often expressive.</p><p>For example, I have seen a study of string ensemble intonation dating<br/>to around 1948 showing that the surveyed players tend to come very<br/>close to Pythagorean -- but with some variations, of course.</p><p>Now we come to my own opinion, speaking as a keyboard player from a<br/>vertical perspective, and realizing that singers may be influenced by<br/>intuitive melodic considerations to which I might be much less<br/>sensitive.</p><p>From a vertical point of view, in a 14th-century kind of style I often<br/>like semitones _narrower_ than Pythagorean, and major thirds and<br/>sixths _wider_, approaching ratios of 9:7 and 12:7 rather than 5:4 and<br/>5:3 (the latter, of course, fitting Renaissance music).</p><p>The attraction of tuning a cadential sonority like G3-B3-E4 before<br/>F3-C4-F4 at 7:9:12 (around 0-435-933 cents) is that we get &quot;smoother&quot;<br/>thirds and sixths at &quot;simpler&quot; ratios, and the same time make the<br/>cadence yet more efficient than in Pythagorean, with semitones of<br/>28:27 or about 63 cents. One could argue that this is &quot;optimizing&quot;<br/>both vertical and melodic dimensions at the same time.</p><p>However, the usual Pythagorean intonation with its active and &quot;bouncy&quot;<br/>major thirds and sixths is also very attractive -- in a keyboard<br/>improvisation, I might use both forms as free variations.</p><p>Possibly some remarks about vocal intonation by Marchettus of Padua in<br/>1318, pointing to cadential semitones narrower than Pythagorean so<br/>that major thirds and sixths can &quot;more closely approach&quot; the stable<br/>fifths and octaves toward which they strive, provide a kind of<br/>historical sanction for such variations.</p><p>Taken literally, Marchettus seems to go yet further, suggesting a<br/>tuning of something like A3-C#4-F#4 before G3-D4-G4 -- note the<br/>element of accidental inflection outside the regular gamut of Bb-B --<br/>at around 30:39:52, or 0-454-952 cents, with a cadential diesis only<br/>about half the size of a usual diatonic semitone. He says that the<br/>cadential major sixth is equally distant from a 2:1 octave or a 3:2<br/>fifth, suggesting a size of about 951 cents, if we take this as a<br/>geometric mean.</p><p>If one takes a &quot;sweet spot&quot; approach of leaning toward simple ratios,<br/>then 7:9:12 would be very attractive in providing such ratios which<br/>nicely fit the ideal of closest approach.</p><p>Another question one could raise from this kind of viewpoint is that<br/>of the minor seventh, a prominent interval in some pieces by Perotin<br/>and Machaut and others. Could this lean toward 7:4 or around 969<br/>cents, possibly favored along with a 7:6 minor third for sonorities<br/>combining these two intervals?</p><p>If one follows the recorded theory, or performs melodic regularity,<br/>then the usual Pythagorean 16:9 (around 996 cents) and 32:27 (around<br/>294 cents) are fine, and I would consider them musically effective as<br/>well as &quot;theoretically correct.&quot;</p><p>For example, there&apos;s a piece of English provenance from around the<br/>late 14th century with some sonorities like D3-F3-C4 which have for me<br/>a rather &quot;floating&quot; quality, suggesting what Jacobus of Liege calls<br/>the &quot;imperfect concord&quot; of the minor seventh. The quality comes<br/>through for me in a usual Pythagorean tuning.</p><p>However, especially in directed cadential progressions, a tuning of<br/>12:14:21 (0-267-969 cents) can be very appealing, again at once<br/>&quot;simple&quot; or &quot;streamlined&quot; vertically, and very efficient in terms of<br/>closest approach, e.g. D3-F3-C4 before E3-B3, or E3-G3-D4 before<br/>F3-C4.</p><p>Here I&apos;m inclined to guess that 14th-century practice may generally<br/>have stayed rather close to Pythagorean, but that either this tuning<br/>or a &quot;7-flavor&quot; tuning at or near 12:14:21 is fitting for new<br/>21st-century music in this kind of style.</p><p>In my own music of this kind, I&apos;m very enthusiastic about using a full<br/>four-voice sonority of 14:18:21:24 or 0-435-702-933 cents,<br/>e.g. G3-B3-D4-E4 before F3-C4-F4; or 12:14:18:21 or 0-267-702-969,<br/>e.g. G3-Bb3-D4-F4 before A3-E4.</p><p>However, this is a new kind of interpretation rather than an attempt<br/>at following period practice -- although Marchettus might give a kind<br/>of problematic license to guess that some ensembles _might_ have used<br/>this kind of intonation at certain cadences.</p><p>Incidentally, one might argue that Pythagorean intonation closely<br/>approximates a &quot;sweet spot&quot; for the _quinta fissa_ or &quot;split fifth&quot;<br/>sonority of Jacobus -- outer fifth &quot;split&quot; into major and minor third<br/>by a middle voice -- in its form with the minor third below,<br/>e.g. A3-C4-E4.</p><p>In Pythagorean tuning, this will be 54:64:81 or about 0-294-702 cents,<br/>not too far from 16:19:24 or 0-297-702 cents. One could argue that the<br/>16:19:24-like qualities of this Pythagorean sonority would tend to<br/>accentuate its relatively concordant feeling, &quot;sweet&quot; although<br/>unstable.</p><p>Curiously, at least one English piece around 1300 and also, as I<br/>recall, a couple of pieces from the Apt manuscript on the Continent of<br/>around 1400, have concluding sonorities of this type; here<br/>Pythagorean, possibly shaded by singers toward 16:19:24, might<br/>actually be more conclusive than a 5-limit tuning at 10:12:15<br/>(around 0-316-702 cents).</p><p>To Paul&apos;s comment about the &quot;style of the Western Isles&quot; influencing a<br/>shift toward 5-limit in the era of Dunstable and Dufay, I would agree,<br/>while adding that the apparent tendency toward some prominent schisma<br/>third sonorities in the instrumental music of around 1400 in Italy<br/>(Faenza Codex) might suggest a potential leaning in this direction<br/>also.</p><p>Dufay&apos;s early style, combining as it does traditional French elements<br/>of the 14th-century Ars Nova with Italian elements of the new century<br/>and the &quot;English countenance&quot; of Dunstable, may draw on both sources<br/>for a new kind of intonational approach.</p><p>From my own JI perspective, I would say that Pythagorean tuning<br/>optimizes the stable 2:3:4 sonority of Gothic music, analogous to<br/>4:5:6 in the Renaissance or 4:5:6:7 in your tetradic/decatonic system,<br/>Paul.</p><p>It also nicely fits the scale of concord/discord, the melodic<br/>structure of the music, and the ideal of &quot;closest approach&quot;<br/>progressions.</p><p>However, if one wants to adjust unstable sonorities to find &quot;sweet<br/>spots&quot; -- or harmonic entropy &quot;valleys&quot; -- then we have such choices<br/>open as 6:7:9, 7:9:12, or 12:14:21, or 16:19:24, as well as the<br/>subsequent Renaissance preferences for 4:5:6 or 10:12:15, etc.</p><p>Without tapes or CD&apos;s, we can only guess what ensembles may have done;<br/>I find Pythagorean a fine model in theory and practice, but not ruling<br/>out various experiments and less conventional offshoots, some of which<br/>I have discussed here.</p><p>Most appreciatively,</p><p>Margo Schulter<br/><a href="mailto:mschulter@value.net">mschulter@value.net</a></p></div><h3><a id=28501 href="#28501">ðŸ”—</a>genewardsmith@juno.com</h3><span>9/23/2001 6:17:00 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In tuning@y..., mschulter &lt;MSCHULTER@V...&gt; wrote:</p><p>&gt; From a vertical point of view, in a 14th-century kind of style I<br/>often<br/>&gt; like semitones _narrower_ than Pythagorean, and major thirds and<br/>&gt; sixths _wider_, approaching ratios of 9:7 and 12:7 rather than 5:4<br/>and<br/>&gt; 5:3 (the latter, of course, fitting Renaissance music).</p><p>Have you tried playing 14th century music on a 22-tone keybaord?

I&apos;m sure I speak for us all here when I express my deep<br/>appreciation for yours, Paul&apos;s, Monz&apos;s and a few others&apos; erudition<br/>with respect to intonational history! Thank you for your many<br/>wonderful and detailed contributions. Your knowledge is a blessing<br/>for me.</p><p>To clarify my thinking a bit, I do not question the role of melodic<br/>habit in infuencing intonation. In those who do not specifically pay<br/>close attention to tuning harmonies (which represents a the vast<br/>majority of singers, for example, in the common practice music of<br/>today), melodic habit is essentially all there is. I am simply<br/>suggesting that the EVOLUTION of intonational preferences is more<br/>strongly influenced by the attractive power of just ratios than some<br/>here seem to allow, if I understand them correctly.</p><p>The microtonal commas, schismas, etc. that were clearly recognized<br/>and discussed historically in medieval times, as well as before and<br/>after, indicate a sensitivity to fine harmonic distinctions and<br/>considerations that is generally lacking in today&apos;s world of common<br/>practice music. Such sensitivity implies to me more than the ability<br/>to tune keyboards according to accepted practice. I feel it also<br/>implies a sense of both harmonic and melodic discrimination that was<br/>quite highly developed.</p><p>Given these &quot;truths&quot;, it seems likely that the attractive power of<br/>just intervals other than 2:3 would not have been forever lost on<br/>musicians as they evolved ever richer polyphonic textures. This must<br/>have been especially true of vocalists and other pitch-flexible souls<br/>whose sensitized ears were capable of picking up on fairly subtle<br/>musical acoustic phenomena.</p><p>Someone stated recently in one of these threads that Pythagorean<br/>tuning endured for &quot;many centuries&quot; in spite of the attractive<br/>potential of 4:5 thirds. If we look at the evolutionary long view of<br/>European church music, this tuning in fact endured relatively briefly<br/>vis-a-vis its previous long history in a MELODIC environment once the<br/>textures got really sophisticated polyphonically (implying<br/>harmonically).</p><p>I believe it endured as long as it did only because of the treatment<br/>of thirds as dissonances (tuning dissonances) requiring resolution to<br/>fifths, fourths, and octaves in the polyphonic styles of the periods<br/>in question. This was a self-reinforcing cycle of &quot;thirds avoidance&quot;<br/>as a stable consonance that delayed the ultimate triumph of the JI<br/>4:5 attractive power.</p></div><h3><a id=28556 href="#28556">ðŸ”—</a>BobWendell@technet-inc.com</h3><span>9/24/2001 2:18:26 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px;

Such a guess will be informed not only by the writings of that era,<br/>&gt; but by our own musical experiences with compositions and styles from<br/>&gt; this era, and maybe also related improvisations or compositions in<br/>&gt; styles inspired by 13th-14th century practice.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; At the same time, in approaching this question, I&apos;m aware that not<br/>&gt; everything I happen personally to like very much in the intonation<br/>of<br/>&gt; this music was necessarily practice during the era, although a<br/>&gt; theorist like Marchettus of Padua may give valuable clues about<br/>&gt; flexible pitch ensembles in some localities and epochs.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; To say that flexible-pitch ensembles may generally have followed a<br/>&gt; &quot;Pythagorean&quot; type of intonation is obviously not to say that the<br/>&gt; elementary intervals of the system were tuned precisely at 2:1, 3:2,<br/>&gt; 4:3, and 9:8, nor that more complex intervals such as major and<br/>minor<br/>&gt; thirds were always tuned precisely at 81:64 and 32:27.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; The variability of human vocal intonation, not to speak of possible<br/>&gt; contextual factors pulling a note or sonority in one direction or<br/>&gt; another, would preclude such an unlikely interpretation.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; However, the argument for a generally Pythagorean-like intonation<br/>&gt; follows three basic lines:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;           (1) Pythagorean is an excellent tuning for the various<br/>&gt;               modes or octave species of medieval monophony and<br/>&gt;               polyphony, with its generous 9:8 whole-tones around<br/>&gt;               204 cents, and its compact diatonic semitones at<br/>&gt;               256:243, around 90 cents;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;           (2) Pythagorean nicely fits the vertical parameters of<br/>&gt;               style, with pure concords of 2:3:4 or 3:4:6, and<br/>&gt;               also relatively concordant sonorities at 4:6:9 or<br/>&gt;               6:8:9, for example; rather complex thirds and sixths<br/>&gt;               nicely resolving cadentially to stable concords; and<br/>&gt;               a rich spectrum of concord/discord fitting the subtle<br/>&gt;               theory of the period;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;           (3) Pythagorean, while providing a regular tuning<br/>structure,<br/>&gt;               neatly fits the 14th-century ideal of &quot;closest<br/>approach&quot;<br/>&gt;               resolutions (e.g. m3-1, M3-5, M6-8, m7-5, M2-4) where<br/>&gt;               the unstable interval resolves by contrary motion as<br/>&gt;               efficiently as possible to its stable goal -- the<br/>total<br/>&gt;               motion being equal to a 32:27 minor third, or about<br/>&gt;               294 cents.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; We can cite various kinds of medieval statements on these points,<br/>for<br/>&gt; example the use of the _minor_ semitone at 256:243 as the &quot;singable&quot;<br/>&gt; one -- in contrast to Renaissance theorists who tell us that the<br/>&gt; _major_ semitone is the singable (or more usually sung) one.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; We can also cite the graduated scales of concord/discord in the 13th<br/>&gt; century, the &quot;closest approach&quot; doctrine of the 14th and early 15th<br/>&gt; centuries, and the taste expressed by theorists for &quot;fully<br/>perfected&quot;<br/>&gt; major thirds and sixths at 81:64 (~408 cents) and 27:16 (~906<br/>cents),<br/>&gt; which expand most efficiently to stable fifths and octaves<br/>&gt; respectively.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; However, this is theory -- at best, an approximate model, given the<br/>&gt; kind of variability that singers and flexible pitch instrumentalists<br/>&gt; find at once unavoidable and often expressive.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; For example, I have seen a study of string ensemble intonation<br/>dating<br/>&gt; to around 1948 showing that the surveyed players tend to come very<br/>&gt; close to Pythagorean -- but with some variations, of course.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Now we come to my own opinion, speaking as a keyboard player from a<br/>&gt; vertical perspective, and realizing that singers may be influenced<br/>by<br/>&gt; intuitive melodic considerations to which I might be much less<br/>&gt; sensitive.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; From a vertical point of view, in a 14th-century kind of style I<br/>often<br/>&gt; like semitones _narrower_ than Pythagorean, and major thirds and<br/>&gt; sixths _wider_, approaching ratios of 9:7 and 12:7 rather than 5:4<br/>and<br/>&gt; 5:3 (the latter, of course, fitting Renaissance music).<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; The attraction of tuning a cadential sonority like G3-B3-E4 before<br/>&gt; F3-C4-F4 at 7:9:12 (around 0-435-933 cents) is that we get<br/>&quot;smoother&quot;<br/>&gt; thirds and sixths at &quot;simpler&quot; ratios, and the same time make the<br/>&gt; cadence yet more efficient than in Pythagorean, with semitones of<br/>&gt;

He says that the<br/>&gt; cadential major sixth is equally distant from a 2:1 octave or a 3:2<br/>&gt; fifth, suggesting a size of about 951 cents, if we take this as a<br/>&gt; geometric mean.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; If one takes a &quot;sweet spot&quot; approach of leaning toward simple<br/>ratios,<br/>&gt; then 7:9:12 would be very attractive in providing such ratios which<br/>&gt; nicely fit the ideal of closest approach.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Another question one could raise from this kind of viewpoint is that<br/>&gt; of the minor seventh, a prominent interval in some pieces by Perotin<br/>&gt; and Machaut and others. Could this lean toward 7:4 or around 969<br/>&gt; cents, possibly favored along with a 7:6 minor third for sonorities<br/>&gt; combining these two intervals?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; If one follows the recorded theory, or performs melodic regularity,<br/>&gt; then the usual Pythagorean 16:9 (around 996 cents) and 32:27 (around<br/>&gt; 294 cents) are fine, and I would consider them musically effective<br/>as<br/>&gt; well as &quot;theoretically correct.&quot;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; For example, there&apos;s a piece of English provenance from around the<br/>&gt; late 14th century with some sonorities like D3-F3-C4 which have for<br/>me<br/>&gt; a rather &quot;floating&quot; quality, suggesting what Jacobus of Liege calls<br/>&gt; the &quot;imperfect concord&quot; of the minor seventh. The quality comes<br/>&gt; through for me in a usual Pythagorean tuning.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; However, especially in directed cadential progressions, a tuning of<br/>&gt; 12:14:21 (0-267-969 cents) can be very appealing, again at once<br/>&gt; &quot;simple&quot; or &quot;streamlined&quot; vertically, and very efficient in terms of<br/>&gt; closest approach, e.g. D3-F3-C4 before E3-B3, or E3-G3-D4 before<br/>&gt; F3-C4.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Here I&apos;m inclined to guess that 14th-century practice may generally<br/>&gt; have stayed rather close to Pythagorean, but that either this tuning<br/>&gt; or a &quot;7-flavor&quot; tuning at or near 12:14:21 is fitting for new<br/>&gt; 21st-century music in this kind of style.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; In my own music of this kind, I&apos;m very enthusiastic about using a<br/>full<br/>&gt; four-voice sonority of 14:18:21:24 or 0-435-702-933 cents,<br/>&gt; e.g. G3-B3-D4-E4 before F3-C4-F4; or 12:14:18:21 or 0-267-702-969,<br/>&gt; e.g. G3-Bb3-D4-F4 before A3-E4.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; However, this is a new kind of interpretation rather than an attempt<br/>&gt; at following period practice -- although Marchettus might give a<br/>kind<br/>&gt; of problematic license to guess that some ensembles _might_ have<br/>used<br/>&gt; this kind of intonation at certain cadences.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Incidentally, one might argue that Pythagorean intonation closely<br/>&gt; approximates a &quot;sweet spot&quot; for the _quinta fissa_ or &quot;split fifth&quot;<br/>&gt; sonority of Jacobus -- outer fifth &quot;split&quot; into major and minor<br/>third<br/>&gt; by a middle voice -- in its form with the minor third below,<br/>&gt; e.g. A3-C4-E4.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; In Pythagorean tuning, this will be 54:64:81 or about 0-294-702<br/>cents,<br/>&gt; not too far from 16:19:24 or 0-297-702 cents. One could argue that<br/>the<br/>&gt; 16:19:24-like qualities of this Pythagorean sonority would tend to<br/>&gt; accentuate its relatively concordant feeling, &quot;sweet&quot; although<br/>&gt; unstable.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Curiously, at least one English piece around 1300 and also, as I<br/>&gt; recall, a couple of pieces from the Apt manuscript on the Continent<br/>of<br/>&gt; around 1400, have concluding sonorities of this type; here<br/>&gt; Pythagorean, possibly shaded by singers toward 16:19:24, might<br/>&gt; actually be more conclusive than a 5-limit tuning at 10:12:15<br/>&gt; (around 0-316-702 cents).<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; To Paul&apos;s comment about the &quot;style of the Western Isles&quot;<br/>influencing a<br/>&gt; shift toward 5-limit in the era of Dunstable and Dufay, I would<br/>agree,<br/>&gt; while adding that the apparent tendency toward some prominent<br/>schisma<br/>&gt; third sonorities in the instrumental music of around 1400 in Italy<br/>&gt; (Faenza Codex) might suggest a potential leaning in this direction<br/>&gt; also.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Dufay&apos;s early style, combining as it does traditional French<br/>elements<br/>&gt; of the 14th-century Ars Nova with Italian elements of the new<br/>century<br/>&gt; and the &quot;English countenance&quot; of Dunstable, may draw on both sources<br/>&gt; for a new kind of intonational approach.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; From my own JI perspective, I would say that Pythagorean tuning<br/>&gt; optimizes the stable 2:3:4 sonority of Gothic music, analogous to<br/>&gt; 4:5:6 in the Renaissance or 4:5:6:7 in your tetradic/decatonic<br/>system,<br/>&gt; Paul.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; It also nicely fits the scale of concord/discord, the melodic<br/>&gt; structure of the music, and the ideal of &quot;closest approach&quot;<br/>&gt; progressions.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; However, if one wants to adjust unstable sonorities to find &quot;sweet<br/>&gt; spots&quot; -- or harmonic entropy &quot;valleys&quot; -- then we have such choices<br/>&gt; open as 6:7:9, 7:9:12, or 12:14:21, or 16:19:24, as well as the<br/>&gt; subsequent Renaissance preferences for 4:5:6 or 10:12:15, etc.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Without tapes or CD&apos;s, we can only guess what ensembles may have<br/>done;<br/>&gt; I find Pythagorean a fine model in theory and practice, but not<br/>ruling<br/>&gt; out various experiments and less conventional offshoots, some of<br/>which<br/>&gt; I have discussed here.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Most appreciatively,<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Margo Schulter<br/>&gt; mschulter@v...</p></div><h3><a id=28559 href="#28559">ðŸ”—</a>Paul Erlich &#x3C;paul@stretch-music.com&#x3E;</h3><span>9/24/2001 3:19:02 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In tuning@y..., BobWendell@t... wrote:</p><p>&gt; I believe it endured as long as it did only because of the<br/>treatment<br/>&gt; of thirds as dissonances (tuning dissonances) requiring resolution<br/>to<br/>&gt; fifths, fourths, and octaves in the polyphonic styles of the<br/>periods<br/>&gt; in question.

For example the wolf fifth, which was normally<br/>avoided.

As early as<br/>1600, when Giovanni Maria Artusi wrote his famous dialogue against<br/>&quot;modern music,&quot; Monteverdi had gained a reputation for his bold use of<br/>the minor seventh, not for his &quot;avoidance&quot; of it at places where<br/>stability was desired -- the latter going without saying for either<br/>Monteverdi or his less favorable critics.</p><p>To explain this bold use of the seventh in Monteverdi, and also its<br/>noninclusion in stable sonorities, we might point to the basic<br/>&quot;grammar&quot; of the music, a grammar which might be termed &quot;triadic&quot; or<br/>&quot;5-limit,&quot; in which the complete 4:5:6 is the most complex stable<br/>sonority.</p><p>At the same time, we might observe that the regular minor seventh in a<br/>meantone tuning such as 1/4-comma will have a relatively complex<br/>nature, with a ratio somewhere roughly midway between 16:9 and 9:5 --<br/>the precise mean, in 1/4-comma, or around 1007 cents. In comparison,<br/>the simplest ratio for a minor seventh is 7:4, at around 969 cents.</p><p>Here we might say that the grammar and the phonology of the music seem<br/>nicely to fit together: a minor seventh is treated as decidedly tense,<br/>and is realized as a rather complex ratio, one with a relatively high<br/>degree of &quot;harmonic entropy&quot; vis-a-vis the simplest ratio of 7:4.</p><p>However, these two aspects of music -- grammatical expectations, and<br/>intonational or &quot;phonological&quot; realization -- can combine in different<br/>ways.</p><p>Let us consider another kind of &quot;seventh avoidance,&quot; to use that term<br/>again in a rather curious way: the practice of barbershop or similar<br/>ensembles who lean toward a tuning of the dominant seventh in a<br/>major/minor style of tonality at 4:5:6:7, but who follow a musical<br/>grammar still calling for a resolution of the 17th-19th century type<br/>with the 7:5 contracting to a 5:4.</p><p>Is it the &quot;nature&quot; of the 7:5 that somehow requires resolution to a<br/>simpler interval, or is this a matter of style -- much like the<br/>resolution of a major third to a fifth in 14th-century style?</p><p>With Paul Erlich, I would say style is here a main factor, since we<br/>can use the same 4:5:6:7 as a stable and conclusive sonority in a<br/>tetradic style such as that based on a decatonic scale in 22-tET.</p><p>Here one might say that the two variables of grammar and phonology<br/>interact in various ways. With Monteverdi or Erlich, the two factors<br/>seem to &quot;match&quot;: a relatively complex type of ratio treated as<br/>decidedly unstable, or a simpler type treated as stable and<br/>conclusive.</p><p>Similarly, comparing Perotin or Machaut to Palestrina or Lasso, we<br/>have a relatively complex type of major third around the Pythagorean<br/>size of 81:64 used in an active and unstable role, in contrast with a<br/>major third at or near the simplest ratio of 5:4 used in a role of<br/>rest and stability.</p><p>However, the fact that some people still feel a need for or tendency<br/>toward &quot;seventh avoidance&quot; (otherwise known as a &quot;resolution&quot;) in a<br/>setting with prominent 4:5:6:7 sonorities suggests that in a medieval<br/>type of setting, a sonority such as 4:5:6 may likewise call for &quot;third<br/>avoidance&quot; -- or &quot;resolving the third to stability.&quot;</p><p>Playing some standard medieval progressions in 1/4-comma meantone<br/>using the regular meantone intervals, I find that the usual<br/>&quot;grammatical&quot; expectations still hold, although their intonational<br/>expression is muted a bit in both directions both by the purity of the<br/>5:4 major thirds and the tempering of the fifths. Categorical<br/>perception -- and grammatical orientation -- still make the standard<br/>Gothic resolutions recognizable and enjoyable.</p><p>One &quot;real-world&quot; experiment of just about this time in 1968 sticks<br/>with me. Newly arrived at college, I was excited about the musical<br/>activity to be found on campus, and had written a simple three-voice<br/>conductus in the style of around 1200 that I hoped to have performed.</p><p>Three singers very generously offered to sight-read on a totally<br/>impromptu basis, and in a rather distracting setting.</p><p>When they reached the end of the first phrase, where I expected to<br/>hear a resolution to a stable fifth, one of the singers, likely<br/>through habit and custom, inserted a third -- and to me it sounded<br/>quite &quot;wrong,&quot; a frustration of the cadential intent.</p><p>Presumably the singers, who were reading unaccompanied, were tuning<br/>such a third at a smooth and concordant ratio -- but it was the wrong<br/>interval, at least from my point of view as a listener and composer,<br/>however tuned.</p><p>Such things may suggest how, for example, early meantone organs around<br/>the late 15th and early 16th centuries could be used in a &quot;backward<br/>compatible&quot; manner for music conceived in a late Pythagorean setting.</p><p>Here I would like to suggest, possibly agreeing with both of you, Paul<br/>and Bob, that the factors of musical grammar or style and phonology or<br/>intonation can sometimes act either to reinforce each other within a<br/>given setting, or to promote change.</p><p>Thus in a Gothic setting on the Continent, the active and &quot;partially<br/>concordant&quot; quality of thirds and sixths is nicely expressed by<br/>Pythagorean tuning; and the tuning reinforces this tendency of the<br/>intervals to follow the patterns of the musical grammar.</p><p>(Incidentally, while theorists in French and related traditions often<br/>speak of thirds as &quot;imperfect&quot; or &quot;intermediate&quot; concords, Italian<br/>writers such as Marchettus of Padua speak of &quot;tolerable dissonances,&quot;<br/>so both kind of descriptions have some historical warrant.)</p><p>In England, however, during this same era, we have evidence through<br/>actual composed music and through accounts of listeners and theorists<br/>that thirds are often used as &quot;the best concords,&quot; sometimes in<br/>closing sonorities, and that they are taken as approximations of the<br/>simple ratios 5:4 and 6:5.</p><p>During the early and middle 15th century, Continental style moves both<br/>toward the &quot;English countenance,&quot; and toward the simpler ratios --<br/>first through schisma thirds in a Pythagorean system, then through a<br/>shift to meantone.</p><p>Here, however, we may note that &quot;evolution&quot; could have moved in other<br/>directions not realized until much later, at least in composed music,<br/>as far as we know.</p><p>For example, Jacobus of Liege in 1325 describes the minor seventh as<br/>an &quot;imperfect concord&quot; -- rather tense, but somewhat &quot;compatible&quot; --<br/>and compares its Pythagorean ratio of 16:9 with a simpler 7-based<br/>ratio, actually the minor-seventh-plus-double-octave at 64:9 with a<br/>ratio of 63:9 or 7:1, thus demonstrating what we should call the<br/>septimal comma at 64:63.</p><p>In 21st-century neo-Gothic music, the resolution of a pure 7:4 or<br/>close approximation to a stable fifth is one favorite progression, and<br/>we have standard four-voice progressions like this, with a &quot;^&quot; showing<br/>a note a septimal comma higher than usual Pythagorean:</p><p>            D4   C4<br/>            B^3  C4<br/>            G3   F3<br/>            E^3  F3</p><p>Here the first sonority has a simple ratio of 12:14:18:21 (around<br/>0-267-702-969 cents), resolving to a 3:2 fifth -- with all these<br/>intervals pure, in a neo-Gothic kind of JI setting based on ratios of<br/>2-3-7-9 odd, or 2-3-7 prime.</p><p>It will be seen that from a &quot;neo-medieval&quot; point of view, the narrow<br/>28:27 semitones E^3-F3 and B^3-C4 nicely carry further the Pythagorean<br/>aesthetic of narrow semitones and efficient resolutions; at the same<br/>time, E^3-G3-B^3-D4 is at a &quot;valley&quot; of harmonic entropy, or &quot;sweet<br/>spot&quot; of acoustical simplicity and concoord, making the resolution<br/>&quot;smooth&quot; and &quot;streamlined.&quot;</p><p>Why should this progression have apparently come into vogue around<br/>2001 rather than around 1401? It is easy enough to derive from<br/>progressions in Perotin or Machaut with minor thirds and sevenths --<br/>if one is inclined in this direction.</p><p>Why should the role of minor sevenths, prominently used by various<br/>composers during the era of 1200-1400, have been rather consistently<br/>restricted during the era of roughly 1420-1590, albeit with some<br/>notable nuances (Josquin&apos;s treatment is freer than Palestrina&apos;s)?</p><p>I am inclined to answer: acoustics supplies the materials, but taste<br/>and fashion largely decide how it is woven.</p><p>The resolution I cite above, of 12:14:18:21 to a 3:2 fifth, might<br/>illustrate this point from another perspective also.</p><p>One might very reasonably ask: why must a pure or near-pure<br/>12:14:18:21 resolve at all?</p><p>Here I would answer that only the &quot;grammar&quot; of a typical neo-Gothic<br/>style sets up expectations for such a resolution -- the convention<br/>that fifths and fourths are the most complex stable intervals.</p><p>In various 20th-century kinds of settings, a 12:14:18:21 sonority<br/>could be described as a kind of &quot;minor seventh chord&quot; -- or, to use<br/>Dave Keenan&apos;s fitting terminology, a &quot;subminor seventh chord.&quot;</p><p>While this sonority does not exhibit what I might term your &quot;strict&quot;<br/>form of &quot;rootedness,&quot; Paul, with the lowest note as an octave of the<br/>fundamental (as in 2:3;4, 4:5:6, 4:5:6:7, or 16:19:24), nevertheless<br/>both the &quot;anchoring&quot; or &quot;semirooted&quot; effect of the 3:2 fifth above<br/>this note, and also the 7:4 minor seventh above, may impart an<br/>acoustical quality tending to reinforce a stylistic treatment of<br/>stability.</p><p>Thus it appears that sonorities such as either 4:5:6:7 or 12:14:18:21<br/>may be heard in the early 21st century as inviting directed<br/>resolutions, or serving as places of restful concord, depending on<br/>style.</p><p>In approaching the question of stylistic change, I would like to<br/>suggest that a general principle may apply which can interact with<br/>intonational factors: the tendency for sonorities used in a<br/>&quot;dissonant&quot; or &quot;incidental&quot; way often to take on a more &quot;blending&quot; or<br/>&quot;prominent&quot; quality, and even eventually to be regarded as stable and<br/>potentially conclusive.</p><p>For example, a given interval or sonority might arise as a result of a<br/>melodic ornament or a figure promoting more conjunct motion between<br/>two stable concords. Then the moment of tension is appreciated for its<br/>deliberate contrast to stability, inviting treatment as a bold and<br/>directed instance of cadential instability. The unstable cadential<br/>sonority may gradually come to be heard as &quot;indeed unstable, but not<br/>so tense,&quot; inviting coloristic treatments also. Finally, the sonority<br/>may come to be heard as representing a new standard of saturated<br/>concord or &quot;complete harmony.&quot;</p><p>This may be a process driven by internal &quot;grammatical&quot; factors, with<br/>or without any obvious or dramatic intonational change. For example,<br/>in 12-tET, a sonority of 0-300-700-1000 cents or 0-400-700-900 cents<br/>may be either definitely unstable or quite stable depending on whether<br/>the milieu is one of 18th-century Classicism or 20th-century harmony.</p><p>If we focus specifically on multi-voice styles of European and related<br/>composition, then this process appears often to be a gradual one, at<br/>least if we focus on the criterion of stability.</p><p>Thus in moving from the use of thirds as &quot;partial concords&quot; in the<br/>complex polyphony of Perotin and his colleagues around 1200, to the<br/>increasingly common acceptance of thirds as elements of closing<br/>sonorities by Josquin and his colleagues around 1500, we cover about<br/>three centuries of richly diverse styles. If we take the young Dufay<br/>(around 1420-1430) or the likely advent of meantone (around 1450) as a<br/>landmark of increasingly &quot;tertian&quot; verticality, then we are still<br/>dealing with some 200-250 years of history.</p><p>Similarly, if we take a conventional historical perspective, we might<br/>start with the bold seventh sonorities of Monteverdi and his<br/>colleagues around 1600, and find that about 300 years of history take<br/>place before sonorities with minor sevenths or major seconds are<br/>treated as fully concordant or stable -- or, as one might have said<br/>around 1900, as not requiring a resolution. Here, also, one could look<br/>to the &quot;floating&quot; seventh chords of the 19th century as an earlier<br/>landmark of transformation, inviting some would say a 4:5:6:7 tuning.</p><p>From a somewhat less conventional perspective, we might also note the<br/>bold use of major seconds and minor sevenths by Perotin and his<br/>colleagues, and ask why it required from around 1200 to 1900 for<br/>sonorities such as 6:8:9 or 4:6:9 or 9:12:16 to be treated as stable<br/>in European composition. They often seem to play a relatively<br/>concordant role in Gothic style, but are restricted in the<br/>Renaissance-Romantic eras, coming into their own in the era of Debussy<br/>around 1900.</p><p>(Note that I choose these three-voice sonorities because they are<br/>already optimized in a medieval Pythagorean intonation.)</p><p>What I would like to suggest is that each period or style has its own<br/>standard of vertical saturation, and its sets of grammatically favored<br/>progressions.</p><p>Finally, I would note that one kind of aesthetic preference might be<br/>termed &quot;mellow instability&quot;: the use of a sonority such as 4:5:6:7 or<br/>12:14:18:21 in a setting where the stylistic or grammatical<br/>expectations favor some kind of &quot;usual&quot; resolution, but where the<br/>smoothness or &quot;mellowness&quot; of the contextually unstable sonority is<br/>much esteemed and relished.</p><p>Most appreciatively,</p><p>Margo Schulter<br/><a href="mailto:mschulter@value.net">mschulter@value.net</a></p></div><h3><a id=28771 href="#28771">ðŸ”—</a>genewardsmith@juno.com</h3><span>9/30/2001 1:26:32 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In tuning@y..., BobWendell@t... wrote:</p><p>&gt; If you go up four just fifths, you will be a syntonic comma sharp<br/>on<br/>&gt; the third you find at the top.
