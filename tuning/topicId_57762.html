It made a predominantly triadic texture, especially 6th<br/>(6/3) chords, out of monophonic repertoire.  It is hard to imagine that<br/>these would have been sung vertically in anything other than simple<br/>5-limit chords.  It is easy to imagine the &quot;Sumer&quot; canon within this sme<br/>intonational environment.</p><p>(Please don&apos;t think that my appeals to imagination here are cop-outs:<br/>England, and English fauxbourdon, was on the margin of European theory<br/>and practice, and the deficits in surviving documents can only be<br/>balanced by modest appeals to the imagination!)</p><p>It is easy enough to to place the blanket label &quot;pythagorean&quot; over all<br/>medieval musical theory and practice, but that is insufficiently<br/>granular to describe what is a reather more complex situation, and this<br/>is apparently true for pythagoreanism in both of the cultures inheriting<br/>the Hellenistic traditions, Christendom and Islamdom.</p><p>On the one hand, one can assume that a literal pythagorean practice did<br/>exist for some repertoire. However, the is ample evidence in both<br/>surviving repertoire and in theory that the pythagorean &quot;project&quot;<br/>included trying to reconcile practices beyond the three limit with an<br/>intellectual (= rational _and_ theological) committment to the three<br/>limit.  Extended pythagorean schemes (e.g. schismatic tunings where a<br/>pythagorean Fb/C is used to approximate the 5:4 third) were one answer<br/>to this problem, quarter-comma meantone was the unique European<br/>solution, and the searches for a successful large-number temperament<br/>have been perpetual Greece, Turkey, in Arabic countries, and even among<br/>some members of this community, however within this community the<br/>problem has been generalized to considered the reconciliation of several<br/>  prime factors, not just three and five.</p><p>Re: Lowinsky</p><p>Edward Lowinsky (1908-85) was a music scholar, with a decidedly<br/>unorthodox bent. His controversial work centered on the &quot;secret<br/>chromatic art&quot; of the high renaissance, and especially questions of<br/>_ficta_ and the characterization of transitional repertoire as tonal or<br/>atonal. Naturally, he touched on some significant intonational issues as<br/>well. Lowinsky remains an essential figure for research in music from<br/>Ockeghem to Orlando and Vincentino to Gesualdo. His article on Mozart&apos;s<br/>rhythm is a small treasure, again with a viewpoint that goes against the<br/>grain.</p><p>As an undergrad, I had a very gracious exchange of letters with<br/>Lowinsky, then retired from Chicago, about the disappearance of the<br/>enharmonic genera, one of my small obsessions.</p><p>Not an idol, but a bit of a hero and a good example of the ability of<br/>Academe to sometimes let unorthodox scholars get past the gates to the<br/>ivory tower. Not a bit of general knowledge, but certainly a name that<br/>should be encountered by anyone with more than a passing interest in<br/>music of the Renaissance.</p><p>Daniel Wolf</p><p>________________________________________________________________________</p><p>--<br/>No virus found in this outgoing message.<br/>Checked by AVG Anti-Virus.<br/>Version: 7.0.308 / Virus Database: 266.8.1 - Release Date: 23/3/05</p></div>
