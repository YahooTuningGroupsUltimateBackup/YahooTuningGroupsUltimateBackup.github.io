The scale is:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; 7:5 divided up by [4,1,1,1,4,2]<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Your basic pattern:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; ratio           cents<br/>&gt; (7:5)^(0/13)    0.000000<br/>&gt; (7:5)^(4/13)    179.234521<br/>&gt; (7:5)^(5/13)    224.043151<br/>&gt; (7:5)^(6/13)    268.851781<br/>&gt; (7:5)^(7/13)    313.660411<br/>&gt; (7:5)^(11/13)   492.894932<br/>&gt; (7:5)^(13/13)   582.512193<br/>&gt;</p><p>Thanks for sharing your scale here. I really enjoyed it. I played it<br/>last night for about an hour, on a variety of timbres, and it sounds<br/>great!<br/>Was nice on Strings, Metallophones, a number of pads sounds, and my<br/>favorite timbre for this was my &quot;Liquid Glass&quot;, a hand made FM Timbre<br/>seasoned with age, which sounds kind of like a Glass Harmonica with a<br/>slow attack and long sustain - inharmonic in nature. The scale was<br/>rich with interesting consonances, and beating intervals, and when I<br/>found the pattern, I was able to get some lovely melodies happening,<br/>but it also had wonderful chordal properties too.</p><p>What is really interesting to me, is that your scale directly<br/>anticipated what I was going to post next about Tritone non-octave<br/>scales. It&apos;s really fascinating to realize that we share this common<br/>feeling about 7/5, which I also find to be a consonant interval. It<br/>may sound perverse, but I like the chord 1/1-7/5-10/7, which I find<br/>particularly lovely on strings.</p><p>&gt; ------<br/>&gt; What I was thinking/my method:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I liked 7:5 and thought it would make a better foregone<br/>&gt; conclusion than 2:1 -- make 7:5 my octave (what I call the<br/>&gt; &apos;Repeat Ratio&apos;). Also, I liked the subminor third 7:6 from<br/>&gt; working with it in 88cET. So I wanted to see if I could<br/>&gt; have both.</p><p>I like this term. Mind if I adopt it? Of course with a scale of<br/>constant structure, all of the intervals are &quot;Repeat Ratios&quot;, but I<br/>know what you mean - it is the interval from which the entire scale<br/>is constructed.</p><p>&gt;<br/>&gt; I looked at all the equal divisions of 7:5.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I found that in decreasing amount of error:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; * 7:6 is the 4th step in 9th root of 7:5<br/>&gt;     (7.977 cents deviation)<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; * 7:6 is the 5th step in 11th root of 7:5<br/>&gt;     (2.093 cents deviation)<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; * 7:6 is the 6th step in 13th root of 7:5<br/>&gt;     (1.981 cents deviation)<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; So I tried working with all three of these (listening) and<br/>&gt; decided that I liked 13th root of 7:5 the best. That gave<br/>&gt; me a chromatic equal scale with a step size of 44.809<br/>&gt; cents.</p><p>I could hear that this was a good choice too when I played it.</p><p>&gt;<br/>&gt; But there were too many notes to make it manageable on the<br/>&gt; keyboard so I wanted to find a nice subset to work with.<br/>&gt; This was probably a matter of taste I suppose but I<br/>&gt; haven&apos;t found many other subsets that I like nearly as<br/>&gt; much as the one I&apos;m showing you here, though maybe someone<br/>&gt; else will find something interesting.

I&apos;ll dig it up later.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; * I&apos;ve tried working with 10:7 but I just can&apos;t get it<br/>&gt; going with 10:7 like I can with 7:5.</p><p>I like 10/7 in two contexts:</p><p>1.    JI Scales with inversional symmetry, where 10/7 is present<br/>along with it&apos;s compliment 7/5.<br/>2.    A totally Utonal JI Scale, where 10/7 is the tritone.</p><p>&gt;<br/>&gt; * A couple years after finding this scale I was reading<br/>&gt; some stuff by Brian and he mentioned some study in which<br/>&gt; listeners found that 7:5 was the very most consonant<br/>&gt; interval they heard.

I wonder if this has anything to do with the findings about<br/>the Tritone Paradox.</p><p>&gt;<br/>&gt; ---------<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I was going to write more but I was up way too late last<br/>&gt; night because I couldn&apos;t sleep cos I was tossing and<br/>&gt; turning and obsessing over the number 23 and could not<br/>&gt; get any rest and now I am so tired I am going to bed now<br/>&gt; early.</p><p>I have this same issue sometimes. I&apos;ll get excited about some new<br/>possibility, and it becomes hard to sleep, and when I do drop off I<br/>feel I&apos;m still dreaming about it. The work goes on in the still of<br/>the night!</p><p>&gt;<br/>&gt; Another scale tomorrow when I am rested if people<br/>&gt; are interested. In the meantime, have fun playing<br/>&gt; with it!</p><p>Yes! Please - more!</p><p>Jeff - I want to thank you for this great presentation. It always<br/>helps me to understand other&apos;s work when they take time to explain<br/>things as well as you have here. You spoke about the theory, timbres,<br/>moods and musical context, making this a wonderful read. I had allot<br/>of fun with this scale - which was entirely new to me. I haven&apos;t<br/>worked with these &quot;Root Tunings&quot;, but I&apos;m sold on how good they<br/>sound. I&apos;ll have to experiment with it some.</p><p>This makes me very eager to learn more about your approach to non-<br/>octave structures - a topic of deep interest here.</p><p>Thanks - and bring out the Scales(!),</p><p>Jacky Ligon</p></div><h3>David J.

What says the list? I guess I<br/>hadn&apos;t given it much though becouse it did not seem to me<br/>that it had caught on but the more I think about it, the<br/>more it seems like a weird term to me. Seems &apos;clunky&apos;.</p><p>&gt; Equally dividing 7:5 - neat idea!  Of course, it might be<br/>&gt; difficult for the typical listener to identify the 7:5 as<br/>&gt; the IoE unless you construct your compositions in such a<br/>&gt; way to as to make it clear.  44.81cents*27 is about 1210<br/>&gt; cents - you probably should avoid having that interval in<br/>&gt; your scales or most ears will inevitably assume standard<br/>&gt; octave equivalence.</p><p>Thanks! But, well the 27 chromatic step span of 1210 cents<br/>does not appear regularly in the scale... which is a nice<br/>feature of course.</p><p>Now, the 26 chromatic step span does occur regularly, it<br/>being the square of the 7:5 Repeat Ratio. Here&apos;s the cents<br/>values of the scale taken out a little further.</p><p>0.000000, 179.234521, 224.043151, 268.851781, 313.660411,<br/>492.894932, 582.512193, 761.746713, 806.555344,<br/>851.363974, 896.172604, 1075.407125, 1165.024385,<br/>1344.258906, 1389.067536, 1433.876166, 1478.684797,<br/>1657.919317, 1747.536578</p><p>Now the 1165.024385 cent interval -- which is of course<br/>(7:5)^2 and which is mapped out every 12 notes of the um<br/>&apos;diatonic&apos; scale (so-to-speak) -- I think is more likely<br/>to pass for the octave since it is also a Repeat Ratio of<br/>its own and 1165 cents can sound like an octave<br/>melodically, say in an arpeggio figure. Though usually to<br/>make that pass (in my experience) you need to have a fifth<br/>like interval in there. The 716.938 cents interval (16<br/>chromatic steps) would work ok except it&apos;s not regular in<br/>the diatonic/subset scale. The way the subset is spaced<br/>out makes it so that you can have an octave like interval<br/>melodically if you want to force it but it&apos;s just not easy<br/>to make any near-1200 interval come out sounding like the<br/>base of the scale.</p><p>&gt; <a href="http://personal.bna.bellsouth.net/bna/d/f/dfin/index.html">http://personal.bna.bellsouth.net/bna/d/f/dfin/index.html</a><br/>--------</p><p>Hey, I read this by you in a previous post:</p><p>&gt; ...music that reflects the order and complexity (unity and<br/>&gt; diversity) of creation in a way that is recognizable and<br/>&gt; digestible to the listener is likely to last a long time.  To<br/>&gt; put it another way, lasting music helps put the listener in a<br/>&gt; frame of mind that raises or enhances the ability to see, or at<br/>&gt; least sense, the beauty and/or profundity in creation.</p><p>...and really agreed with it -- I think it says much<br/>better and more correctly what I would liked to have said<br/>when I just superficially glanced past the whole idea by<br/>saying:</p><p>&gt; 3) Model things on patterns found in nature:<br/>&gt;    a) Use the golden ratio.</p><p>So anyway, It inspired me to take a look at your web site.<br/>Very nice, Mr. INTP!</p><p>Liked the color design, illustrations &amp; navigation a lot<br/>too.

A<br/>previous suggestion was x-Equal Division of the Non-octave followed by the interval being divided.  IOW,<br/>&quot;13-EDN 7:5&quot;, in this case.  But that implies something special about the 2:1 ratio, an idea you don&apos;t<br/>seem to hold with.</p><p>&gt; Is IoE really in wide usage?</p><p>No, but it&apos;s rarity is only due to the fact that 99% of the scales and tunings discussed here are octave<br/>equivalent.</p><p>Thanks for the compliment on the web site!</p><p>--<br/>David J.
