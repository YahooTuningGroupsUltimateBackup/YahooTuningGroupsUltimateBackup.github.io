To introduce myself I&apos;ll<br/>start with what may be a painfully obvious question, but it&apos;s one for<br/>which I would be interested to hear an answer.</p><p>Suppose we had something like an ordinary keyboard, only with three<br/>rows of white keys and two rows of black keys. The tuning would be<br/>1/4 comma mean tone, so that for instance B# major is not the same as<br/>C major.</p><p>The top row is to be tuned to D flat flat major, the middle row to C<br/>major, and the bottom row to B# major. The top black keys are shared<br/>between D flat flat and C, consisting of the usual black keys<br/>regarded as flats--namely, D flat, E flat, G flat, A flat and B flat.<br/>Similarly the bottom black keys consist of the black keys regarded as<br/>sharps, and are shared between the B# white keys and the C white<br/>keys, and consist of C#, D#, F#, G# and A#.</p><p>I said 1/4 comma temperament (that is, the fifth is flat by 1/4 of a<br/>diatonic comma, meaning by the fourth root of 81/80, or 1.5*5^(-<br/>1/4)), but we get almost the same system with 1/4.1511... comma<br/>temperament, and also something perfectly acceptable for authentic<br/>performance of older music. The advantage of this tuning is that now<br/>we have 31 equal divisions of the octave, and this keyboard becomes a<br/>way of playing music notated in the ordinary way in something like an<br/>ordinary way, on a 31-tone division. (The 31 tones can be played in<br/>succession by playing three white keys up, then two black keys up,<br/>and so forth.)</p><p>My questions are:</p><p>(1) Has this already been done?</p><p>(2) Would such a keyboard be hard to make?</p><p>(3) Would such a keyboard be hard to play?</p></div><h3><a id=27130 href="#27130">ðŸ”—</a>Paul Erlich &#x3C;paul@stretch-music.com&#x3E;</h3><span>8/17/2001 4:13:30 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In tuning@y..., genewardsmith@j... wrote:</p><p>&gt; My questions are:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; (1) Has this already been done?</p><p>Many times, mainly in the 16th and 20th centuries.

In<br/>either approach, different people might prefer different systems for<br/>naming the notes -- Vicentino and Colonna, for example, take rather<br/>divergent approaches.</p><p>Also, there are at least two approaches to arranging a keyboard for a<br/>31-note cycle. One is to start with a usual keyboard design, and add<br/>enough extra accidentals to include at least 31 notes -- possibly<br/>using two manuals.</p><p>The other is a &quot;generalized keyboard,&quot; for example Colonna&apos;s in 1618,<br/>where there are five ranks of keys, each with a diatonic scale of<br/>seven notes per octave, arranged so that each is a diesis or fifthtone<br/>higher than the previous one. Interestingly, since this scheme<br/>actually provides 35 keys for each octave although there are only 31<br/>distinct notes, the effect is to make some notes available at more<br/>than one place on the keyboard -- a kind of &quot;redundancy&quot; favored in<br/>many later generalized keyboards also for easier playing.</p><p>Then, as now, a new type of keyboard has a certain unfamiliarity to<br/>overcome: we are told by 16th-century sources that some players<br/>excelled on these instruments, while many found them rather<br/>intimidating with their many notes per octave. It may be largely a<br/>question of musical acculturation, so to speak.</p><p>Anyway, welcome to our community, and thanks also for the JI<br/>questions, which I&apos;ll address in another post.</p><p>Most appreciatively,</p><p>Margo Schulter<br/><a href="mailto:mschulter@value.net">mschulter@value.net</a></p></div><h3><a id=27161 href="#27161">ðŸ”—</a>Paul Erlich &#x3C;paul@stretch-music.com&#x3E;</h3><span>8/19/2001 8:12:11 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In tuning@y..., mschulter &lt;<br/>MSCHULTER@V...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Also, there are at least two approaches to arranging a keyboard for a<br/>&gt; 31-note cycle.
