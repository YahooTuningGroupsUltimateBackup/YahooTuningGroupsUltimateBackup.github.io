For instance, in Father, you can get a bunch of 7/6&apos;s and 9/8&apos;s that are really almost Just if you jack up the 5-limit error to give a generator of around 468 cents, and these intervals will sound considerably nicer than the best 3- or 5-limit harmonies you will ever get out of Father temperament.</p><p>So, I&apos;d like to do a little survey of some other &quot;bad&quot; rank-2 temperaments and see if I can&apos;t find variations on the TOP-RMS generators that produce better-sounding harmony using optimized compound intervals rather than primes.

So in hanson temperament, for example, you don&apos;t get to 3/1 for<br/>the first time until you&apos;ve stacked a bunch of minor thirds on top of<br/>each other, which means you aren&apos;t going to be getting very many<br/>fifths.</p><p>This doesn&apos;t apply to this scale, because there&apos;s major thirds and<br/>fifths all over the place.

The end is, 9:10 is pretty important in<br/>this regard because we&apos;re talking about 5-limit harmony. 8 -&gt; 9 -&gt; 10<br/>is a pretty important melodic motion to have, so it&apos;s probably a good<br/>bet to start looking at how well things like 8:9:10 or 16:19:20 (or<br/>16:17:19:20) are represented or what not. Meantone has great<br/>approximations to the first one, Diminished has great approximations<br/>to the second one. Blackwood in 15-tet doesn&apos;t have good<br/>approximations to either. In 20-tet, the first one starts to really<br/>pop out, and the scale starts to sound bright and amazing.
