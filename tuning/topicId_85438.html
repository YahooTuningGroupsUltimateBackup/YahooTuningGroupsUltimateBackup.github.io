This is really pretty easy to do. OpenMPT is a free open source project. The tuning capability is not well understood by most users so I&apos;m working out the kinks.</p><p>Here is an example:</p><p>I recorded a short performance in 11 ET using a classical guitar &quot;instrument&quot; made from 4 classical guitar samples.</p><p><a href="http://clones.soonlabel.com/public/micro/11-ET/micro-Module1.mp3">http://clones.soonlabel.com/public/micro/11-ET/micro-Module1.mp3</a></p><p>The saved format is a &quot;module&quot; which stores the midi-like data and the samples used for the performance.</p><p>The advantage is that it is free, samples are plentiful, and pretty easy to do, at least for one instrument. (so far)</p><p>Chris</p></div>
