But try it with the dyads in the chord<br/>&gt; ---<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt; I find that when a 6:5 plays and the upper note drops out, the lower<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt; seems to rise, but when the 5:4 plays and the lower note drops out,<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt; the upper seems to GO DOWN IN PITCH.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; in both cases the pitch that remains moves toward the center.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; there is a simple explanation for this. there&apos;s a well-known<br/>&gt; psychoacoustical phenomenon at work. when the cochlea is<br/>&gt; exposed to more than one frequency at once, the pitches are<br/>&gt; subjectively &grave;stretched apart&apos; compared to how they sound as<br/>&gt; isolated pitches. there are many references in the literature. one<br/>&gt; interesting side-effect of this is that pure sine tones often sound a<br/>&gt; bit higher than complex tones with the same fundamental frequency<br/>&gt; (references below). the phenomenon has also been used to explain the<br/>&gt; &apos;octave stretching&apos; effect with respect to the perception of sine<br/>&gt; waves -- stretched octaves seem melodically &apos;in tune&apos;.</p><p>Melodically in tune? As opposed to harmonically in tune? If by that you mean<br/>pitches in series as opposed to pitches sounding simultaneously, I&apos;m not<br/>sure how that would apply to the jerries experiment. (Perhaps, it doesn&apos;t?)</p><p>&gt; the idea is<br/>&gt; that the &apos;training&apos; for octaves occurs with exposure to natural<br/>&gt; harmonic series, which (due to the multiplicity of notes) are always<br/>&gt; accompanied by the &apos;stretching&apos; effect, and so one expects the<br/>&gt; stretch even when the other harmonic series components are absent.<br/>&gt; see <a href="http://www.mmk.ei.tum.de/persons/ter/top/octstretch.html">http://www.mmk.ei.tum.de/persons/ter/top/octstretch.html</a><br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; ************************************************************<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Terhardt, E. (1971). Die Tonh&ouml;he Harmonischer Kl&auml;nge und das<br/>&gt; Oktavintervall. Acustica 24, 126-136<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; The frequencies of a sinusoidal tone and of a complex tone with the<br/>&gt; same pitch are slightly different. The investigations show that<br/>&gt; usually the pitch of a complex tone is lower than the pitch of<br/>&gt; sinusoidal tone of the same (fundamental) frequency. The frequency<br/>&gt; ratio corresponding to the subjectively correct pitch interval of a<br/>&gt; musical octave usually differs slightly from the value 2. This<br/>&gt; phenomenon was investigated with low pure tones and with complex<br/>&gt; tones. The results for complex tones are explained by the octave<br/>&gt; intervals that were found with simple tones and the pitch differences<br/>&gt; between simple and complex tones.</p><p>Judged melodically (one after the other) or harmonically (sounding<br/>simultaneously)?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; These conclusions were revisited here:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Terhardt, E., Grubert, A. (1987). Factors affecting pitch judgments<br/>&gt; as a function of spectral composition. Percept. Psychophys. 42, 511-<br/>&gt; 514<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Stimulated by a recent paper by Platt &amp; Racine [Perception &amp;<br/>&gt; Psychophysics 38, 543-553 (1985)], we discuss the factors that<br/>&gt; probably are involved in certain inconsistencies observed in pitch<br/>&gt; judgments of tones with different spectral composition. Typically,<br/>&gt; discrepancies reported in the literature are of the order of 10 cents<br/>&gt; in magnitude. We point out that measurement of such small pitch<br/>&gt; effects is heavily dependent on systematic individual differences;<br/>&gt; and, when individual differences are averaged out (as is essentially<br/>&gt; the case in Platt &amp; Racine&apos;s experiments), verification of the actual<br/>&gt; auditory stimulus SPL within a few dB is necessary. Utilizing the<br/>&gt; virtual-pitch theory,</p><p>Virtual-pitch theory? I like the sound of that. :-)</p><p>&gt; we evaluate the effects of frequency, SPL, and<br/>&gt; earphone frequency response. Further, we present experimental and<br/>&gt; theoretical data on pitch of piano tones relevant to the problem. The<br/>&gt; study elucidates that, taking into account the factors mentioned,<br/>&gt; agreement between the various data considered, as well as theoretical<br/>&gt; understanding, actually is much better than may have become apparent<br/>&gt; on first sight.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; In Terhardt, E.

ISBN 3-540-63408-<br/>&gt; 8, pp. 353-356 describe how, in many cases, the pitch of the harmonic<br/>&gt; complex tone turns out to be slightly lower than that of the pure<br/>&gt; tone.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Webster, J.C., Miller, P.H., Thompson, P.O., Davenport, E.W. (1952).<br/>&gt; The masking and pitch shifts of pure tones near abrupt changes in a<br/>&gt; thermal noise spectrum J. Acoust. Soc. Am. 24, 147-152<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; When a pure tone is mixed with a noise of uniform spectrum, its<br/>&gt; threshold is sraised. At levels above threshold, its loudness and<br/>&gt; pitch are changed by the presence of the noise. Introducing abrupt<br/>&gt; changes in the slope of the noise spectrum by filtering out<br/>&gt; (rejecting) one octave changes these effects in the vicinity of this<br/>&gt; gap. The masked threshold for a pure tone varies from the value for<br/>&gt; unfiltered noise at the edges of the gap to a value approximately 25<br/>&gt; dB lower at the middle. This indicates that gappedi-noise may be used<br/>&gt; to mask out sounds outside of the gap without unduly raising the<br/>&gt; threshold of sounds in the gap. Presence of white noise generally<br/>&gt; raises the pitch of a pure tone whose frequency is between 500 and<br/>&gt; 4000 cps. Presence of noise with the gap does not raise the pitch of<br/>&gt; a pure tone located in the upper half of the gap. For a tone located<br/>&gt; in the lower half of the gap, the pitch is raised more than it would<br/>&gt; be in the presence of unfiltered noise. The changes in the judged<br/>&gt; loudnessof pure tones partially masked by a gapped-noise reaffirm the<br/>&gt; importance of the tails of the excitation pattern in their effect on<br/>&gt; loudness.</p><p>Thresholds?
