Intonationally, the second one is a bit looser, and there also isn&apos;t a second oud providing some drones.  More importantly, the second one is phrased a bit more solemnly, while the first one is a bit more upbeat.  They both sound like the same scale to me.  I should note, though--Rast (in quartertones) is 0-200-350-500-700-900-1050-1200 cents, and I can clearly hear whenever they play the 500-700-900 sequence as sounding &quot;majory&quot;, because it *is* &quot;majory&quot;.  The more emphasis they put on the major 6th, the more &quot;sunny&quot; it sounds, and the first one emphasizes that interval more often.</p><p>Of course, I also play in rast in 17-TET all the friggin&apos; time, so I may be more accustomed to it than others.  To me it&apos;s really just rast, it has a flavor like major but a bit more &quot;stern&quot; or &quot;mature&quot;...&quot;major&quot; is a little boy smiling, rast is an old man smiling....</p><p>-Igs</p><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, Mike Battaglia &lt;battaglia01@...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; These are two pieces by Munir Bashir in rast:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; 1) <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A3G7VW1RMks">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A3G7VW1RMks</a><br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; 2) <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M5xqD_t11ig">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M5xqD_t11ig</a><br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; These are both in rast, but to me, the first one has sort of a &quot;major&quot;<br/>&gt; feel to it, whereas the second has more of a &quot;minor&quot; feel.
