Hopefully, we can<br/>convince you to try different tunings, also.  If<br/>this just isn&apos;t your thing, you can at least pick<br/>up a few customers for your keyboard here...<br/>provided you do a few things to make it microtuning<br/>friendly, and deliver it for a reasonable price.</p><p>&gt;I otherwords will re-map the keys in various<br/>&gt;arrngements to facilitate the style of music I<br/>&gt;will be playing.</p><p>You may be interested in: <a href="http://www.daskin.com/">http://www.daskin.com/</a>.</p><p>&gt;What are the advantages of 6-6 or Janko keyboard?</p><p>In short, the Janko has the property that any<br/>musical pattern will be fingered the same anywhere<br/>on the keyboard.  This is not true of the 7x5 (a.k.a.<br/>Halberstadt) arrangement (a C-major scale is not<br/>fingered quite the same as an Ab-major scale on a<br/>Halberstadt).  But the Janko also makes any fingering<br/>pattern sound the same, while the Halberstadt allows<br/>you to play the chords of a diatonic scale with very<br/>nearly the same fingering pattern (major and minor<br/>triads are both 1-3-5), and no Janko keyboard can<br/>do that.</p><p>So the question is: do you want to play diatonic<br/>music?  If so, 7x5 may be (but maybe not!) better.<br/>If, on the other hand, you want just to fire out<br/>cool rhythms, arpegios, and such, then Janko is<br/>almost certainly the better choice.</p><p>&gt;Also need suggesstions for color coding the keys.</p><p>One thing we&apos;re all likely to agree on is the<br/>desire for removable keycaps, which would come in<br/>different colors (and maybe even textures), so<br/>that we could make our own patterns.</p><p>-Carl</p></div><h3>Clark &#x3C;CACCOLA@NET1PLUS.COM&#x3E;</h3><span>12/23/2000 4:43:57 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Hi, Vas and Carl; welcome, and farewell...</p><p>There was some discussion of symmetrical, 6x6 keyboards here I think in<br/>August. Graham Breed and Troubledoor described some of the<br/>idiosyncracies playing with these arrangements. Theirs are interleaved<br/>(actually, both are &quot;based&quot; on the Halberstadt at least in materials)<br/>but like to Janko&apos;s, transpositions finger the same. Check<br/>&lt;<a href="http://www.microtonal.co.uk/instrum.htm">http://www.microtonal.co.uk/instrum.htm</a>&gt; and<br/>&lt;<a href="http://home.earthlink.net/~troubledoor/">http://home.earthlink.net/~troubledoor/</a>&gt; for pictures.</p><p>Paul Vandervoort has made some improvements to the Janko keyboard, which<br/>Carl brought to my attention; at least in 3-d, more mechanically coupled<br/>implementations there are some serious drawbacks to the historical<br/>model, most of which Vandervoort seems to have designed out. Non-coupled<br/>2-d keyboards won&apos;t have these troubles, but if you&apos;re modifying<br/>existing stuff, have a look at John Allen&apos;s pages which adress many<br/>ergonomic concerns: &lt;<a href="http://www.bikexprt.com/music/introduc.htm">http://www.bikexprt.com/music/introduc.htm</a>&gt;</p><p>Allen has a large section on generalized keyboards, also which are<br/>mentioned in a current thread (&quot;Requirements of a microtonal<br/>synthesizer&quot;); I&apos;m not sure of the connection, but Janko&apos;s is quite<br/>similar to R.H.M. Bosanquet&apos;s 19th century arrangement for his<br/>enharmonic harmonium. Erv Wilson has done a lot of work with this type<br/>of key arrangement for extended tuning systems, some of which is up at<br/>&lt;<a href="http://www.anaphoria.com">http://www.anaphoria.com</a>&gt;, and a commercial implementation is at<br/>&lt;<a href="http://www.starrlabs.com/">http://www.starrlabs.com/</a>&gt;. His hexagonal keys help to condense the<br/>vertical scale of the array, also to permit more adjacent notes in an<br/>otherwise fairly diatonically aligned system.</p><p>&gt;Also need suggesstions for color coding the keys.</p><p>Adriaan Fokker used rectangular-key generalized keyboards in his 31-tone<br/>organs, tiered and color coded light and dark to emphasise the diatonic<br/>patterns, but something like Lego would work great for switchable<br/>patterns!</p><p>Clark</p></div><h3>Vas Gardiakos &#x3C;vas@albrite.com&#x3E;</h3><span>12/25/2000 8:47:27 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@egroups.com">tuning@egroups.com</a>, Carl Lumma &lt;CLUMMA@N...&gt; wrote:</p><p>Carl,</p><p>This is my first response.</p><p>I assume that your comments are<br/>deleted in the reply?</p><p>thanks for the info.</p><p>I may consider marketing my keyboard.</p><p>I had been hopping that someone else had<br/>develped and markedted a two-dimentional<br/>keyboard at a rasonable price.
