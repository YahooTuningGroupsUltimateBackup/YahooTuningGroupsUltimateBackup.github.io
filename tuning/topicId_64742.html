One of the many small jobs<br/>he took on during his lifetime was transcribing songs from field<br/>recordings made on cylinders (1933). He later used some of these<br/>melodies (a Zuni one in &quot;Cloud-Chamber Music&quot;, the last of the eleven<br/>&quot;Intrusions&quot;; a Cahuilla song in &quot;The Bewitched&quot;). This is all<br/>well-documented in Gilmore&apos;s biography of Partch (p.93).</p><p>Cheers,<br/>Jon</p></div>
