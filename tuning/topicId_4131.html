It reminds me of a<br/>recent sushi meal I shared with Sasha Bogdanowitsch.  Before getting into a<br/>&quot;technique&quot; I think a bit more emphasis on the &quot;raison d&apos;etre&quot; for learning<br/>diverse tunings internally may be in order.</p><p>There are 2 kinds of solfege taught in NYC: fixed-Do and moveable-Do.  Fixed<br/>mirrors absolute pitch (e.g. A=440 always).  Moveable, taught where I teach<br/>at C.W. Post, assumes the position of traditional tonal music with an<br/>extended meantone compass.  Both perspectives have their value and I have to<br/>alternate between them on occasion.</p><p>Since I don&apos;t have perfect pitch which is the result of a gene, I have<br/>developped an overly athletic relative sense of pitch, enhanced by my<br/>familiarity of diverse tuning constellations (or arrays, or modes, or<br/>scales).  With select choices, one could, after several serious years of<br/>work, sing any pitch combination of 1200-TET.  Tuning machines are no longer<br/>necessary (they break down anyway over time).</p><p>With the idea of liberating past the machines, like composing from the<br/>imagination and not plinking things out on a keyboard, one could learn to<br/>hear &quot;differently.&quot;  All sounds within the 1200-TET compass will have a<br/>sensibility, a microtonal &quot;address.&quot;</p><p>As for the technique: emotional memory works best for me.  Learn a tune in a<br/>special tuning and then it becomes part of your personal dictionary.  Call<br/>upon it as you will and add to it until you reach point where you&apos;ve got the<br/>territory covered.  It is quite liberating.</p><p>Johnny Reinhard<br/>AFMM<br/><a href="mailto:Afmmjr@aol.com">Afmmjr@aol.com</a></p></div><h3>D.Stearns &#x3C;stearns@xxxxxxx.xxxx&#x3E;</h3><span>8/6/1999 12:33:12 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>[Johnny Reinhard:]<br/>&gt;With select choices, one could, after several serious years of work,<br/>sing any pitch combination of 1200-TET.</p><p>[!!??] I&apos;m very interested in exactly what you mean by &quot;With select<br/>choices.&quot; Could you elaborate on this?</p><p>Thanks,<br/>Dan</p></div><h3>Afmmjr@xxx.xxx</h3><span>8/6/1999 10:23:59 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>When Jon Catler introduced me to 31-TET I had only been familiar with<br/>quartertones.  He explained to me, 20 years ago, that there were no notes in<br/>common, unless we farily arbitrarily lined them up so that there was a single<br/>note in common.</p><p>When we played Cowpeople together with his rock band JC &amp; The Microtones, I<br/>had an ascending 24-tone line against his descending 31-TET line.  These 2<br/>are now ingrained in me.</p><p>When I first spent an afternoon listening to LaMonte Young&apos;s Well-Tuned<br/>Piano, I became ill due to the purity of the intervals hitting me all at<br/>once.  It was like getting car sick because my mind couldn&apos;t keep up with the<br/>sensory input.  When I could match just intervals to specific numbers I had<br/>the tools to reference a chain reaction&apos;s worth of relationships at any point<br/>and LaMonte&apos;s music became a joy.</p><p>Do any of you remember a panic when trying to find a particular microtone?<br/>Only be internally referencing landmark intervals cane you traipse across the<br/>pitch divide.</p><p>Certain select cross referenced tunings...keep the A=440 or other common tone<br/>between them...at least in some referenceable way.</p><p>Try 24ET, 31ET, JI, 19ET, 7ET, and add to taste.
