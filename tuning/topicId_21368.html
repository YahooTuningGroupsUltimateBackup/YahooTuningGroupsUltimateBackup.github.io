I really think that this is the kind of thing that<br/>people are interested in today, since the loft was PACKED...  there&apos;s<br/>not a lot of space in there to begin with.</p><p>It seems almost ALL of the pieces were microtonal... I don&apos;t believe a<br/>single one was in 12-tET and they all used the latest technology.</p><p>My piece went well... my wife Linda danced to it...</p><p>Bill Alves STATIC CLING looks GREAT on a BIG full-sized screen, rather<br/>than on computer video...</p><p>Also, Peter Adamczyk did a really fiery piece for piano and tape which<br/>he played himself.  As you recall, Peter did a really nice lecture on<br/>using quarter tones to emulate harmonic series harmonies at the<br/>Claremont Microfest.  It was quite a virtuosic performance... I&apos;m<br/>getting a copy of the piece... maybe my own group of crazies can<br/>present it again...</p><p>_______ ____ _____ ____<br/>Joseph Pehrson</p></div>
