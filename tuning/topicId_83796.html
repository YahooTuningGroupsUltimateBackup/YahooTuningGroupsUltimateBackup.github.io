I did this because diatonic note names are<br/>based on the unison interval 81:80, which is not tempered out by any<br/>diaschismic system other than 12-EDO, and therefore a system to notate<br/>pitch classes in diaschismic temperament would need a different<br/>foundation to look elegant and workable.</p><p>Here is a letter system that I came up with a while ago:</p><p>I s K s L t S s M s &Atilde; s N s Q t R s H s I<br/>Notes: J, O and P are omitted to avoid confusion with I, Q and R,<br/>respectively; M and N are chosen as subdominant and dominant of I due to<br/>M and N being the median letters of our alphabet; S is used to fill in<br/>the gap between L and M, and H is used as a leading note to I. &apos;s&apos;<br/>represents a diatonic semitone (16:15 = 17:16 = 18:17 = 135:128) and &apos;t&apos;<br/>represents a minor tone (10:9 = 75:68)</p><p>For example, here are some chords:<br/>I.S.N - 4:5:6 I Major Triad<br/>K.&Atilde;.Q - 4:5:6 K Major Triad<br/>S.N.H.K - 10:12:15:17 S Minor Tetrad<br/>&Atilde;.R&acirc;&quot;.K.S&acirc;&quot; - 10:12:15:17 &Atilde; Minor Tetrad (&acirc;&grave;<br/>and &acirc;&quot; represent a 25:24 change of pitch)<br/>M.Q&acirc;&grave;.I.L - 20:25:30:34 M Major-minor Tetrad (May sound somewhat<br/>dissonant)<br/>I.S.N.R.K - Approx. 8:10:12:14:17 Pentad (Requires 120:119 as unison<br/>interval, i.e. Pajara temperament)</p><p>Discuss this system here, and I highly appreciate any suggestions and<br/>comments you have.~</p><p>-- Karisa des-Aries (Not my real name)</p></div>
