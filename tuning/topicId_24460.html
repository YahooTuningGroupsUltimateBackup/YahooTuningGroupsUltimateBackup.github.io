I&apos;ll try playing these on my 22-tET electric<br/>guitar (with the 7th string ignored). One problem with the scores is<br/>that you are using standard notation to specify the open string<br/>tunings, but standard notation doesn&apos;t fit well with 22-tET. For<br/>example, should D-F# be 7 frets or 8 frets? Perhaps you should put in<br/>a little more detail on the open string tuning, to avoid ambiguity.</p></div><h3><a id=24478 href="#24478">ðŸ”—</a>Alison Monteith &#x3C;alison.monteith3@which.net&#x3E;</h3><span>6/7/2001 1:37:12 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Paul Erlich wrote:</p><p>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Thanks so much Alison!

I&apos;ve rarely looked back.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; You&apos;re very welcome. I&apos;m having fun with the 31-tET guitar now but I&apos;m having trouble<br/>&gt; finding anything really &quot;unique&quot; and musically convincing to do with it . . . I&apos;ll just keep<br/>&gt; practicing diatonic triadic stuff on it for now since it sounds so sweet . . . half-step 3,<br/>&gt; whole step 5, half step 3, whole step 5 . . .</p><p>I did the Jimi thing with my 22 tet guitar. Took it to the bathroom, played it in bed, at the TV and<br/>so on. Then I caught some motifs, ostinatos and progressions and was at least able to make something<br/>I could call my own music. I remember reading that Carlos Santana took about an hour&apos;s practice to<br/>get rid of the Hendrix, Clapton and Benson blues influences before he could do his own thing. What I<br/>like about 22 is that it&apos;s fresh and I haven&apos;t much to refer back to. I&apos;m not sure but perhaps the<br/>diatonic and good triadic layout of 31 makes it that much harder to find original riffs and changes.<br/>I&apos;d love to try 31 one day though.  Just a few thoughts.</p><p>Best Wishes.</p></div>
