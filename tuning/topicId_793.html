I compose a lot<br/>&gt;with just pen and manuscript paper, and I&apos;ve been mentally struggling<br/>&gt;with the Idea of notating non-12TET...<br/>&gt;I suppose it&apos;s possible to start with a &quot;key&quot; declaring what symbols or<br/>&gt;lines represent what frequency (a la percussion clef)...  but that would<br/>&gt;be too easy to confuse with standard 12TET notation.</p><p>Well, even standard 12TET notation is based on notation designed for<br/>sequences of just fifths or meantone temperament, but it works well enough<br/>for 12TET (and other meantone-like scales). For other kinds of tuning,<br/>there are many options. I&apos;ve used a 6-line staff with notes on the lines or<br/>touching one side or the other of a line to write 15-tet.</p><p>Lately, I&apos;ve been experimenting with systems of notation that use the<br/>traditional clefs and seven notes with an extended set of accidentals such<br/>as half-sharps and intervals of a single scale degree. One idea that seems<br/>to work well for many scales is to alternate major and minor thirds, adding<br/>up to 2 octaves. So for 16-tet, I have: A=12, C=0, E=5, G=9, B=14, D=2, and<br/>F=7. The thirds on A, E, and B are minor, and the others are major. In<br/>15-tet, only 2 major thirds and 5 minor thirds add up to two octaves, so I<br/>end up with A=11, C=0, E=5, G=9, B=14, D=3, F=7 (CE and GB are the major<br/>thirds). The choice of which note to represent as C is somewhat arbitrary;<br/>it could just as easily have FA and CE as the major thirds.</p><p>11-tet has one very large &quot;major&quot; third (almost exactly 9/7) and six minor<br/>thirds, so the system works (minimally) even for that unusual scale. But<br/>10-tet only has one size of third, and seven of them add up to a little<br/>more than 2 octaves, so this method doesn&apos;t work. It *is* possible to<br/>notate 20-tet with only two different sizes of thirds, but the notation<br/>that looks the most promising to me so far has 2 large thirds (420 cents),<br/>1 intermediate third (360 cents), and 5 minor thirds (300 cents).</p><p>Using a similar system, basic notation for just intonation (or for 53-tet)<br/>might be represented as: F=4/3, A=5/3, C=1/1, E=5/4, G=3/2, B=15/8, D=9/8.<br/>For 10/9, I&apos;ve considered writing D with a comma next to it to represent<br/>the syntonic comma (81/80). Sharps and flats could represent 25/24, so<br/>E-flat would be 6/5, and G-sharp would be 25/16. 16/9 would be notated as<br/>B-flat with a comma (15/8*24/25*80/81). New accidentals would have to be<br/>created for intervals with prime factors of 7 or greater.</p><p>Obviously, this system doesn&apos;t work for non-octave scales. My notation for<br/>the Bohlen-Pierce scale is based on the intervals 5/3 (written as a major<br/>sixth) and 9/5 (written as a minor seventh).</p><p>C=1/1 Db=27/25 Ebb=25/21 Ex=9/7 Fx=7/5 G#=75/49 A=5/3 Bb=9/5 Cb=49/25<br/>Dbb=15/7 Dx=7/3 E#=63/25 F#=25/9 G=3/1</p></div>
