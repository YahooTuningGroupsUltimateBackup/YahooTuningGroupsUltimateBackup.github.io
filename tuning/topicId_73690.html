Indeed, if we are not discussing keyboard<br/>instruments, I see no reason at all to restrict ourselves to meantone<br/>schemes... and if we are discussing them, 1/4-comma is the most likely<br/>and widely described meantone apart from 12-et.</p><p>Neither Tosi nor Leopold Mozart tells us with any useful accuracy what<br/>they mean by a comma. How can we tell they didn&Acirc;&acute;t mean what we think<br/>of as a diesis? Did they know or care about the difference between a<br/>comma and a diesis?<br/>The most we can deduce is that the difference between enharmonic<br/>sharps and flats is, generally, not inaudibly small, but still rather<br/>smaller than a semitone. Note that the difference between G# and Ab in<br/>various prescriptions for JI is also some type of comma or diesis.</p><p>The 20th century discussions, and Monz&Acirc;&acute;s webpage, proceed on the<br/>assumption that these guys (along with Quantz and so on) were<br/>mathematical tuning theorists who had exactly the same understanding<br/>of regular temperaments and jargon as, say, Barbour did - whereas in<br/>fact neither of them even DEFINED the comma in their writings. How<br/>could a reader possibly know how large the enharmonic difference<br/>should be, if is it merely called &quot;a comma&quot; but never given a clear<br/>definition? The sources also say &quot;Go look at a monochord&quot;, but they<br/>never say what one should do with the monochord.</p><p>The relevant quote:</p><p>&quot;it is true that the relative sizes of the two<br/>different semitones it is not stated anywhere in this book.&quot;</p><p>- Nor is the size of &quot;a comma&quot; ever defined in Tosi or L.Mozart or<br/>Quantz or ...</p><p>&quot;we know that Mozart&apos;s father Leopold taught<br/>that the flats were a comma higher than the sharps,<br/>which indicates 55edo or another meantone similar to it.&quot;</p><p>- No, it doesn&Acirc;&acute;t necessarily indicate any meantone at all, nor does it<br/>tell us what was meant by &quot;a comma&quot; without further unwarranted<br/>assumptions.</p><p>Besides, what right do we have to assume that the same (diatonic or<br/>chromatic) semitone was always played the same size regardless of the<br/>musical situation? Some semitones have mainly harmonic implications<br/>(eg B-C supported by G7-C harmony), some mainly melodic (eg F#-E#-F#<br/>over a static harmony of D major). Are we supposed to believe that one<br/>size fitted all without exception? That is replacing musical judgement<br/>with mathematical machinery.</p><p>The most we can tell is that Mozart&Acirc;&acute;s theoretical paradigm of<br/>intonation had enharmonic differences which are similar to those of<br/>some kinds of meantone. (But also to those of 5-limit JI.) And that<br/>the keyboards in later 18th century England, where presumably the<br/>Attwood tutorial took place, were not tuned in equal temperament.</p><p>As for Tosi, please search back in the message archives at the Yahoo<br/>groups webpage to see how that source has been misquoted and<br/>selectively quoted over the years to make it seem much more certain<br/>and qualitatively precise than it was.

As a test, I spent the<br/>year of 2006 trying not to intentionally listening to any recordings<br/>unless the work was composed for and existed only in a recorded<br/>format (e.g. classical tape music).  I discovered that, as a result,<br/>I ended up listening to much more live music, played more music<br/>myself, and did a lot more sight-reading than had been my habit. It<br/>was an invaluable experience as a musician, and since then I now find<br/>that I listen only seldom to recordings -- I don&apos;t even have a cd<br/>player in my studio any more, and am firmly back into a live music<br/>habit. More importantly, I think, I have recovered some sense of the<br/>difference in presence between a music played in a wonderful room<br/>with musicians scattered throughout the space and music that comes<br/>out of loudspeakers; it&apos;s not a distinction between bad and good, but<br/>a recovery of the distinct qualities of each experience. I happen to<br/>like real players in real rooms, and I prefer my own music to be made<br/>that way; other musicians have other preferences which I respect, but<br/>I&apos;d hope that they respect mine as well.</p><p>This doesn&apos;t mean that I don&apos;t value recordings as documents -- I<br/>need my fix of Carlos Kleiber&apos;s Seventh with some regularity, and<br/>with the recent passing of Pak Cokro, turning to his recordings was a<br/>real source of solace -- but rather that those documents are taken in<br/>some perspective.  I don&apos;t particularly buy the arguments about<br/>recordings making music more accessible to the world at large; I have<br/>had more than a small taste -- through a lot of ghosted film scoring<br/>over the years -- of what &quot;access&quot; actually means and what<br/>commodification can do to an art work, and I&apos;d like to spare my own<br/>music all of that. Moreover, my own music has never been made in a<br/>spirit in which such access has much meaning. If I write incidental<br/>music for a stage play, that&apos;s how it should be heard; or if I write<br/>for an extraordinary musician friend, like Hildegard Kleeb, than it&apos;s<br/>supposed to be heard live and played by her. The world is full of<br/>generic products, _Gebrauchsmusik_, playable anywhere anytime by<br/>anyone, and given that, I can only recognize a need to recover some<br/>specificity, some texture, a local and personal taste.</p><p>djw</p></div><h3>Afmmjr@aol.com</h3><span>10/4/2007 1:20:47 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Thank you, Daniel, for expressing your views.

I tried to argue this here about key<br/>&gt; characters of the well temperament era, and had a hard time<br/>&gt; convincing anyone.  I can&apos;t remember if I remembered to argue<br/>&gt; that they predate well temperament.</p><p>The Lindley review has a number of quotations from the 17th century,<br/>mainly France, which make it fairly clear that the use of &apos;wrong&apos;<br/>enharmonic pitches, due to the limited tonal range of the keyboard,<br/>was one clear difference (possibly among many) in the embryonic<br/>concept of key character. I think Hugyens had some remark about E<br/>minor&apos;s character differing from D minor on account of the high D#. (F<br/>minor is at the other end of the spectrum...) The corollary is that C<br/>major and D major are practically *not* different in character.</p><p>The more pitches you have per octave - 14 was fairly common in German-<br/>and and Italian-speaking areas, 19 also cropping up - the less<br/>unorthodox your intonation will be, and the less cause you have to<br/>consider keyboard-based key character.</p><p>The first list of key characters coming from Charpentier around 1700<br/>might be seen as including some such keyboard-based features, but<br/>otherwise reads as rather haphazard or arbitrary. At that date we also<br/>have the complication of &apos;temperament ordinaire&apos; which, if one<br/>consults the sources,</p><p><a href="http://harpsichords.pbwiki.com/Temperament_Ordinaire">http://harpsichords.pbwiki.com/Temperament_Ordinaire</a></p><p>was, at that epoch, probably a mixture of meantone with three or four<br/>notes interpolated between the ends of the chain of regular fifths, in<br/>effect spreading the &apos;wolf&apos; fifth around so as to eliminate it. This<br/>also spreads the meantone key characters (understood as resulting from<br/>a range Eb-G#) around so that, conceivably, E major might have had a<br/>milder version of the overbright quality of B major, and C minor some<br/>degree of the funereality of F minor.</p><p>&gt; &gt; the tonal plan of a work like Messiah<br/>&gt; &gt; seems to me to be closely connected to the limits on minor<br/>&gt; &gt; tonalities</p><p>Is there a &apos;work like Messiah&apos; apart from Messiah itself? But I think<br/>I see what you might mean. The remark is rather cryptic though. Can<br/>you be more specific? Check the recitatives and &apos;He was despised&apos;<br/>before making any broad statement about tonal plans.</p><p>Handel&apos;s keyboard suites certainly didn&apos;t respect any such limits...</p><p>~~~T~~~</p></div>
