The prevalence of the diatonic<br/>&gt; scale (or close approximations to it) in music having its roots<br/>&gt; in the European Classical tradition is probably a direct<br/>&gt; consequence of the evolution of medieval plainsong chants in<br/>&gt; structures (monasteries and cathedrals) having long reverberation<br/>&gt; times.  These chants only &quot;work&quot; in such an environment if all<br/>&gt; of the notes of the scale are consonant with the reverberations<br/>&gt; of previously sounded notes.

Also, a JI diatonic scale has a wolf 5th between the<br/>&gt; 2nd and 6th degrees, so it is not possible for _all_ the notes of<br/>&gt; the scale to be consonant with the reverberations of previously<br/>&gt; sounded notes.</p><p>The diatonic scale has been the &apos;basic&apos; scale of European music<br/>since the time of the ancient Greek theoretical treatises<br/>(starting with Aristoxenus, c. 330 BC), way before plainchant and<br/>cathedrals.</p><p>Altho Greek treatises discuss the chromatic and enharmonic genera,<br/>they generally state that these had fallen out of use and that<br/>the diatonic was the only one left.  This is somewhat contradicted<br/>by Ptolemy (c. 150 AD) who made accurate measurements of the intervals in<br/>all types of scales *actually in use*, but by the<br/>time of the beginnings of Roman-Catholic plainchant (post-<br/>Germanic-invasion, c. 600 AD), the only genus left in use was<br/>indeed the diatonic; this, at least, is according to all extant<br/>theoretical descriptions.</p><p>It&apos;s also quite possible that, due to the tremendous reduction<br/>in literacy and to the inability of the German monks to read Greek<br/>(or Latin, for that matter), the other genera were still in use<br/>and the theorists simply did not know how to deal with or<br/>explain the numerical measurements: it&apos;s much easier to understand<br/>and explain a cycle of powers of 3.</p><p>Of course, there&apos;s no way for us to be absolutely sure about<br/>what tuning was used in purely vocal music 1000 years ago.<br/>But evidence indicates that for vocal church music, Pythagorean<br/>(3-limit) tuning was the one generally (or possibly even<br/>exclusively) used until about the 1300s, by 1490 almost everyone<br/>was arguing about whether the tuning should be Pythagorean or<br/>Just (5-limit), and by 1558 in Italy (Zarlino) and 1612 in<br/>Germany (Lippius) 5-limit was pretty widely accepted as the<br/>&apos;standard&apos;.  (And remember, theoretical description *always*<br/>lags behind the practice it&apos;s describing.)</p><p>I&apos;ve posted here before on my theory that the main reason<br/>for the shift in tuning was the acoustical perceptions resulting<br/>from performance in the cathedrals of Europe, whose large<br/>enclosed spaces and high ceilings were made possible only with<br/>the &apos;Gothic&apos; architectural advances of the late 1100s.  I&apos;ve<br/>argued that the long reverberation times would have reinforced<br/>the volume or extended the apparent duration of the stronger<br/>overtones, allowing perceptive listeners to hear higher-limit JI<br/>harmonies arising from the mass of sound emanating from the choir.</p><p>And it *is* possible to perform plainchant in a JI scale with<br/>*every* note consonant with those already being heard - it<br/>just wouldn&apos;t be a type of scale that we usually recognize as<br/>a &apos;basic&apos; scale.</p><p>This really doesn&apos;t have much bearing on the question anyway,<br/>because by the time period under consideration, unaccompanied<br/>monodic plainchant had mostly disappeared from the church rituals.<br/>Since the Ars Nova movement in Paris in the 1200s, most church<br/>music thruout Europe had become quite emphatically polyphonic.</p><p>Of course, Marchetto of Padua in 1318 discussed the use of<br/>intervals smaller than the &apos;standard&apos; Pythagorean semitones.<br/>But because of his obscure numerical descriptions, exactly what<br/>he meant is not entirely clear.  See [plug alert]:</p><p><a href="http://www.ixpres.com/interval/monzo/marchet/marchet.htm">http://www.ixpres.com/interval/monzo/marchet/marchet.htm</a></p><p>There is also evidence suggesting that the shift from Pythagorean<br/>to Just was already in process in English popular music as early<br/>as the 1200s (see Walter Odington and Theinred of Dover).</p><p>So based on my historical knowledge, it appears that the use<br/>of polyphony, the tuning shift from 3- to 5-limit in &apos;serious&apos;<br/>music, and the building of Gothic cathedrals, are all intertwined,<br/>taking place largely during the 1200s and 1300s.</p><p>-monz</p><p>Joseph L.

However, diatonic seconds, sevenths, and the tritone will always<br/>create dissonance (by 5-limit standards) against the reverberations, so the<br/>goal of having _all_ notes consonant with all others is unattainable anyway.<br/>Nevertheless, a heavily reverberating diatonic &quot;mush&quot; is one of the most<br/>pleasant sounds in the world. In addition to the meantone and Pythagorean<br/>varieties, I would add (you guessed it) the 22-tET diatonic scale (in<br/>&quot;Pythagorean&quot; rather than &quot;just&quot; conception), where the fifths are<br/>acceptable, the minor thirds are very close to 7:6, the major thirds are<br/>extremely close to 9:7, and the minor sevenths are decent approximations of<br/>7:4s. The minor seconds of 55 cents are very dissonant but very beautiful in<br/>the context of these higher-limit yet comprehensible consonances. Many JI<br/>composers (such as Micheal Harrison) have used a similar scale, 1/1 9/8 7/6<br/>4/3 3/2 14/9 7/4, for droney reverberant stuff, but 22-tET eliminates the<br/>&quot;wolf&quot; fifth of 32:21 between the 7/4 and the 4/3, much as meantone tunings<br/>eliminate the 40:27 wolf.</p><p>Joe Monzo wrote,</p><p>&gt;and by 1558 in Italy (Zarlino) and 1612 in<br/>&gt;Germany (Lippius) 5-limit was pretty widely accepted as the<br/>&gt;&apos;standard&apos;.</p><p>5-limit was accepted as the standard as an ideal for each consonant<br/>interval, but in practice, the 5-limit JI scale had very little importance.<br/>Meantone tuning was accepted as the standard during this period (Zarlino was<br/>no exception!), and if you like to start with the 5-limit JI scale as your<br/>ideal, meantone tuning was necessary in order to eliminate the one wolf<br/>fifth and the one Pythagoean minor third from the former.</p><p>&gt;And it *is* possible to perform plainchant in a JI scale with<br/>&gt;*every* note consonant with those already being heard - it<br/>&gt;just wouldn&apos;t be a type of scale that we usually recognize as<br/>&gt;a &apos;basic&apos; scale.</p><p>OK, Joe, tell us how this magic is done.</p></div><h3><a id=3341 href="#3341">ðŸ”—</a>David J.
