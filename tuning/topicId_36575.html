After many years with requests for a<br/>Mac version of Scala, now there finally is one.<br/>Thanks to Tobias Giesen, the latest console version 1.82<br/>was ported to MacOS X. At the moment, this is an alpha<br/>test version, and we&apos;re asking for people to test it<br/>thoroughly. The download location is</p><p><a href="http://www.tgtools.de/ScalaX_1.82_alpha1.sit">http://www.tgtools.de/ScalaX_1.82_alpha1.sit</a></p><p>Instructions:<br/>- unstuff, move to a convenient location<br/>- go into Terminal window, use the cd command<br/>  in order to go into the folder where the<br/>  unstuffed files are,<br/>- start Scala using the command:<br/>  ./scala<br/>- send bugs and comments to Manuel.</p><p>Tobias was mentioned here before as author of Finale plugins and<br/>tools. More than a year ago, we were trying to make a version for<br/>the earlier MacOS 9 after Gary Morrison and I bought a toolset which<br/>was required for the compiler to run. But it was too cumbersome and<br/>Tobias got stuck with the finish in sight. Now with MacOS X, it<br/>became very easy and required only small adaptations, which however<br/>still needs to be proven by testing.</p><p>Who knows a simple MIDI-file player for OS X? At the moment we&apos;re<br/>looking for one, which is necessary for the SEND command to work.</p><p>Also looking for people who can provide programming experience<br/>for the MIDI-out port under OS X.</p><p>When circumstances permit, we&apos;ll try to port Scala 2.x to OS X too,<br/>but that depends on the port of Gimp and its toolkits to OS X, and<br/>may take a year or so.</p><p>Homepage: <a href="http://www.xs4all.nl/~huygensf/scala">http://www.xs4all.nl/~huygensf/scala</a><br/>Scale archive: <a href="http://www.xs4all.nl/~huygensf/doc/scales.zip">http://www.xs4all.nl/~huygensf/doc/scales.zip</a></p><p>Manuel</p></div><h3>emotionaljourney22 &#x3C;paul@stretch-music.com&#x3E;</h3><span>4/23/2002 12:12:29 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In tuning@y..., manuel.op.de.coul@e... wrote:</p><p>&gt; Uncork the champagne!
