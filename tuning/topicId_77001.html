You&apos;re AB business gives you, on a 5-limit lattice,</p><p>;               X<br/>;            X X<br/>;           X<br/>;        X X<br/>;       X<br/>;    X X<br/>;   X<br/>;X X</p><p>which doesn&apos;t leap out as being an obvious place to start. Although I think it does give you an approximate 7:4 so you probably are thinking along the right lines.  Also, I note that 12-equal doesn&apos;t temper out the ragisma so a 12 note scale isn&apos;t an obvious starting point either.  You could try 8, 19, 26, 27, 34, 46, 53, 65, or 72.  And probably you need more than 12 notes for such a complicated temperament to be useful.</p><p>               Graham</p></div><h3><a id=77013 href="#77013">ðŸ”—</a>Herman Miller &#x3C;hmiller@...&#x3E;</h3><span>6/7/2008 7:32:02 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Petr Pa&dcaron;&zdot;&dblac;&dcaron;&zdot;&dblac;zek wrote:</p><p>&gt; Considering untempered planar tunings, I understand that a simple 12-tone &gt; one can be made with a chain of fifths like &quot;PPPSPPPSPPP&quot; (reduced into a &gt; single octave range) because this is the same as making 5/1 twice and then &gt; adding three Ps to each of the three tones, which means there are actually &gt; two generators (P and 5/1).

It&apos;s a bit like if you make a linear temperament by breaking the fraction into individual prime multiples, which often doesn&apos;t make MOS. For example, the prime coordinates for the comma of 78732/78125 are &quot;-2 -9  7&quot; which can be easily split into &quot;-9 -9  0&quot; and &quot;7  0  7&quot;. This means that you can also make semisixth by stacking nine 1/6s and seven 10/1s and tempering each of these by 1/16 of the comma, which eventually makes you arrive at 1/1 again.

I did a search on my archived email for 6144/6125 and found &quot;A 7-limit planar temperaments list&quot; from 7/23/2002, but none of these have names. My guess is that few if any of the temperaments on the list have been evaluated for musical uses, due to the practical issues of working with temperaments having more than 2 generators.</p><p>If you do the algebra with 2/1, 5/4, and 35/32 as generators, and 6144/6125 as a unison vector, the wedgie comes out as &lt;&lt;&lt;2, -3, -1, 11]]]. And you get this for a generator mapping:</p><p>[&lt;1, 1, 2, 3], &lt;0, 1, 1, -1], &lt;0, 2, 0, 1]&gt;<br/>TOP-RMS: 1199.710244, 387.319274, 157.429655</p></div><h3><a id=77069 href="#77069">ðŸ”—</a>Carl Lumma &#x3C;carl@...&#x3E;</h3><span>6/8/2008 4:04:05 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Herman wrote:<br/>&gt; I&apos;m not sure of the history of &quot;marvel&quot;, whether it was first<br/>&gt; used for a 7-limit or an 11-limit temperament.</p><p>It was originally used to mean the 225/224 7-limit planar<br/>temperament.  -Carl</p></div>
