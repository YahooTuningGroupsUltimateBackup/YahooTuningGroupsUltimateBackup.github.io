First, there&apos;s absolutely no reason Gordon should<br/>leave the list...so, Gordon, come back, if you still feel it&apos;s of value<br/>to you. Second, to Ed...geez, Ed, we&apos;re talking about a government<br/>founded on the genocide of a whole culture, and who thought, through the<br/>concept of Manifest Destiny, that God ordained us to commit that<br/>genocide, as the &quot;rightful rulers&quot; of this land. So, at the very least,<br/>the history we were taught in public schools was totally innacurate,<br/>cause I don&apos;t ever recall being taught what really happened here as the<br/>USA was being created. In fact, throughout my school years, it seems to<br/>me that, the overiding message I got was that the white Europeans were<br/>the superior race...which is, obviously, a bunch of shit. So, it&apos;s not<br/>hard to infer that, perhaps, much of our other education in public<br/>schools was/is equally meaningless. And, besides some very basic<br/>rudiments (simple math, reading, although I learned how to read before I<br/>got to school), I have used very very little of the info I was taught at<br/>public school in real life...I don&apos;t feel like it prepared me for much<br/>at all. Everything of value, I learned outside of public school, as the<br/>experiences of life occurred, and I was forced to deal with them. My<br/>public schooling amounted to very little in my life...and, judging from<br/>the mess we call American culture today, it isn&apos;t a stretch, I feel, to<br/>think that perhaps the govt doesn&apos;t want the public at large to be very<br/>sharp. The old saw &quot;bread and circuses&quot; seems to apply very well to our<br/>society today...I think we&apos;re a pretty shallow lot, for the most<br/>part...Hstick  PS...in a related story, I just read where the mayor of<br/>Toronto is in a jam because of a dumb, racist remark he made about going<br/>to Mombasa...he said (paraphrased) that he could &quot;see himself in a pot<br/>of boiling water, with a bunch of natives dancing around him.&quot;<br/>Yikes...where did he receive the education that allowed him to say such<br/>an insane thing? I&apos;ll bet it was public, government sponsored,<br/>schools...</p></div>
