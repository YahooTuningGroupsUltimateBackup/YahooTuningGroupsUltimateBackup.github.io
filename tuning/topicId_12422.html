Musicians read linearly and see the closer neighborhood of the<br/>quartertone vicinity (and general direction) while reading measures ahead of<br/>playing.  (Please, be patient, this is difficult for me to explain.)  As a<br/>cent is half the acoustically tiny schisma, the quartertone is half the<br/>traditional semitone diesis.  It&apos;s a good signpost for the eyes.</p><p>On winds, the quartertone fingerings are more radical from the semitones than<br/>most any other microtone (since they bisect the semitones).  The advantage to<br/>advance telegraphing before looking at numbers is helpful in playing<br/>accurately and in tempo (based on life experience).</p><p>Even strings and brass would benefit from a quartertone symbol.  Trumpets<br/>have much leeway (minor third) for each piston combination...and that&apos;s<br/>better dealt with by a quartertone signpost, I think.</p><p>Johnny Reinhard</p></div><h3>Kraig Grady &#x3C;kraiggrady@anaphoria.com&#x3E;</h3><span>9/6/2000 8:21:01 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Johnny !<br/>    My own introduction into microtones was through 31. 24 had and still does have no appeal!</p><p><a href="mailto:Afmmjr@aol.com">Afmmjr@aol.com</a> wrote:</p><p>&gt; You are right about the math, Joe Monzo, but it&apos;s not the end of the story.<br/>&gt; In order for someone to approach the 1200 divisions of the octave, they must<br/>&gt; at least know quartertones.
