Is this possible, and if so, how can I set up Scala to do this?</p><p>Thanks,</p><p>Mike</p></div><h3>manuel.op.de.coul@eon-benelux.com</h3><span>1/31/2003 2:08:49 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Mike,</p><p>Unfortunately not. The Mac port of Scala is a somewhat dated<br/>command line version. The newer one with MIDI relaying has a<br/>graphical user interface which isn&apos;t ported yet. I read that<br/>with OS X version 10.2 the X Windows protocol is supported,<br/>so things are getting a bit better at last. So this is probably<br/>only a matter of time. A bigger problem though is that I don&apos;t<br/>own a Mac and have no knowledge about the Mac MIDI API whatsoever...</p><p>Manuel</p></div>
