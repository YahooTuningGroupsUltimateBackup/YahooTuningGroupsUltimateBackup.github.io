Thank you, memory!</p><p>I didn&apos;t recognize this at first (of course, the 126/125 should&apos;ve given me<br/>a clue), but as Paul Erlich pointed out to me, this is similar to what I<br/>call Starling temperament (built from 388-cent major thirds and 312-cent<br/>minor thirds, which results in a fifth of 700 cents and a major sixth of<br/>888 cents). Here are a couple of relevant links:</p><p><a href="http://www.io.com/~hmiller/music/marrgarrel.html">http://www.io.com/~hmiller/music/marrgarrel.html</a><br/><a href="http://www.uq.net.au/~zzdkeena/Music/DistributingCommas.htm">http://www.uq.net.au/~zzdkeena/Music/DistributingCommas.htm</a></p><p>In addition to the regular Starling temperament, I have a version with a<br/>tempered octave (2 cents sharp). This improves the 7/4 approximation at the<br/>expense of some of the other intervals (the optimum distribution mentioned<br/>by Dave Keenan in his article referred to above actually has slighly narrow<br/>octaves).</p><p><a href="/tuning/topicId_6385.html#6385">/tuning/topicId_6385.html#6385</a></p><p>--<br/>see my music page ---&gt;   ---&lt;<a href="http://www.io.com/~hmiller/music/index.html">http://www.io.com/~hmiller/music/index.html</a>&gt;--<br/>hmiller (Herman Miller)   &quot;If all Printers were determin&apos;d not to print any<br/><a href="https://twitter.com/io">@io</a>.com  email password: thing till they were sure it would offend no body,<br/>\ &quot;Subject: teamouse&quot; /  there would be very little printed.&quot; -Ben Franklin</p></div><h3><a id=30200 href="#30200">ðŸ”—</a>genewardsmith@juno.com</h3><span>11/14/2001 9:31:00 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In tuning@y..., Herman Miller &lt;hmiller@I...&gt; wrote:</p><p>&gt; I didn&apos;t recognize this at first (of course, the 126/125 should&apos;ve<br/>given me<br/>&gt; a clue), but as Paul Erlich pointed out to me, this is similar to<br/>what I<br/>&gt; call Starling temperament (built from 388-cent major thirds and 312-<br/>cent<br/>&gt; minor thirds, which results in a fifth of 700 cents and a major<br/>sixth of<br/>&gt; 888 cents).
