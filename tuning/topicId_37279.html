What is weird about this?<br/>&gt; Well, the library only received the issue in May.<br/>&gt; Of 2002. And when I went to the shelve to see if,<br/>&gt; indeed, the article was in that particular issue<br/>&gt; (it was), I noted that the Winter 2000 issue, just<br/>&gt; previous, was indeed received in winter (such as<br/>&gt; it is in SoCal) of 2001.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Maybe &quot;Perspectives of Year-Old Music&quot;? :)</p><p>hmmm ... this really struck a chord of resonance with<br/>me.  i noticed it years ago in Philly when i used to bike<br/>almost every day to the LaSalle University library to<br/>read PNM.</p><p>and whatever this odd syndrome is, it also seems to have<br/>infected other music-theory journals as well.  i&apos;m actually<br/>a *subscriber* to the Journal of Music Theory, and i just<br/>received in the mail a few days ago my &quot;latest&quot; issue:<br/>Fall 2000 ... !!!</p><p>-monz</p></div>
