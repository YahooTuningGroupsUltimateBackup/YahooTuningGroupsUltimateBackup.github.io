It is especially interesting<br/>in that history and facts are being rewritten to suit publicity purposes.<br/>From your posting:</p><p>&gt;If you haven&apos;t heard Partch&apos;s<br/>&gt;work, take heed: his compositions capitalize upon Kronos&apos; willingness<br/>&gt;to risk their rare virtuosity in a musical &quot;I dare you to play this&quot;<br/>&gt;fashion.</p><p>&quot;His&quot; compositions were never intended to be performed by a string quartet,<br/>a homophonous concept that never interested him. It is only through the<br/>questionable practice of transcription that they can even be &apos;playing&apos;<br/>Partch on their concerts. Virtually everyone who had a long term<br/>relationship with Partch, either personal or professional, is aghast at<br/>what they are doing *to* his music.</p><p>&quot;I dare you to play this&quot;. What a childish reason to make music.</p><p>&gt;...performers with a deep sense of commitment to the music they play</p><p>...just not to the aesthetics that underlay the notes, in this case. Even<br/>in the mainly vertical niche market of &quot;contemporary music&quot; (or whatever<br/>phrase one cares to use), Kronos once again vindicates P. T. Barnum<br/>assessment.</p><p>As you can see, this subject is one close to me, having worked with Partch;<br/>I&apos;ve long since lost the ability to laugh off these indiscretions. If you<br/>happen to be the one who formulated the press release, please be advised<br/>that there are people out here that knew more about Partch then Dave and<br/>the gang, and you&apos;ve all done a complete disservice to one of America&apos;s few<br/>unique composers -- you&apos;ve lumped him back in with the rest of the crowd.</p><p>Sorry, but I had to call you on this.</p><p>Regards,<br/>Jon Szanto<br/>..... . . . . . . . .  .  .  .  .  .  .  . . . . . . . . .....<br/>Jonathan M.
