BUT I DON&apos;T WANT TO MAKE IT COMPLICATED.</p><p>Unfortunately, you won&apos;t be able to make correct inferences about<br/>difference tones otherwise.</p><p>&gt; &gt; &gt; For istance, we have the C maj chord and we will get:<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; C-E=C<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; C-G=C<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; E-G=C<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; This is true for first-order difference tones but it&apos;s important<br/>to<br/>&gt; &gt; specify the octave.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; What I was thinking is following:<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; 1. we know that there is acoustical phenomena called difference<br/>&gt; &gt; tone.<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; That we can hear when two tones are sounding at the same time.<br/>That<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; was discovered by Tartini (maybe even earlier).<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; We now know that Tartini was actually hearning second-order<br/>&gt; &gt; difference tones . . .<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; 2. If we have tone A4 of 440 Hz and A5 that is 880 Hz,<br/>difference<br/>&gt; &gt; tone<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; would be 440 hz, well, the same bottom (ground) note.<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; 3. If we have note C4 and G4 played together in nontempered<br/>system<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; difference tone will be exactly bottom note C but (C3), if we<br/>play<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; perfect fourth (C4-F4) the difference tone will be F2 (upper<br/>note!).<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; 4. If we play a chord, we have to calculate all the distances<br/>&gt; &gt; between<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; all notes to get their rellevant difference tones.<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; 5. The program would not display tones and chords more than in<br/>one,<br/>&gt; &gt; or<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; two octaves. It is just practical, since the minor second (C4-<br/>Db4)<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; gives very low note (sub-contra), and it can be transposed to<br/>the<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; octave no 4 (treble cleff) for easy reading.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; Yes, but is that transposition a musically fair representation of<br/>&gt; &gt; what is heard?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; AT THE MOMENT, I USE IT AS A COMPOSITION PROCESS, NOT AS AN ACOUSTIC<br/>&gt;  PHENOMEN. ANYWAY, I FIND IT VERY INTERESTING IN A WAY I DO FOR MY<br/>&gt;  WORK. I CANNOT EXPLAIN HOW INTERESTING FOR ME IS THAT MAJOR CHORD<br/>HAS<br/>&gt;  ITS BOTTOM NOTE AS DIFFERENCE NOTE 8THAT IS OF COURSE WELL-KNOWN).<br/>&gt;  EVEN THAT TONE(S) IS VERY DEEP I CONSIDER IT AS VERY IMPORTANT<br/>EVEN IF<br/>&gt;  I TRANSPOSE IT TWO OR MORE OCTAVES UP.<br/>&gt;  THE COMPOSING PROCESS DOESN&apos;T SAY IF I AM GOING TO USE THAT NOTE IN<br/>&gt;  PRECISE OCTAVE.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; Well, if we have chord C-Eb-G (minor) it will calculate<br/>distances:<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; C Eb = Ab<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; C G  = C<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; Eb G = Eb<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; and we have got Ab, C and Eb as difference tones, and will<br/>continue:<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; Ab C = Ab<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; Ab Eb = Ab<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; C Eb = Ab<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; That is the end: difference tones of C-maj are Ab-maj, and<br/>&gt; &gt; difference<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; of that chord is just tone Ab.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; Yes; this can be easily understood in that the fundamental of the<br/>&gt; &gt; minor triad C Eb G or 10:12:15 is 1 or Ab. You can&apos;t get any<br/>smaller<br/>&gt; &gt; difference than 1 from a set of integers no matter how many<br/>&gt; &gt; differences you take!<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;  NO, I DON&apos;T SPEAK ABOUT FUNDAMENTAL TONE. I AM INTERESTED IN<br/>&gt;  DIFFERENCE TONE. DIFFERENCE TONE AND FUNDAMENTAL SOMETIMES CAN BE<br/>THE<br/>&gt;  SAME (INTERVALS UP TO FIFTH). TRY TO FIND DIFFERENCE TONE OF MINOR<br/>&gt;  SIXTH OR SEVENTH. IN THAT CASE DIFFERENCE TONE AND FUNDAMENTAL ARE<br/>&gt;  DIFFERENT.</p><p>You aren&apos;t paying enough attention to what I wrote. I know that<br/>difference tones and fundamental tones are different in general! What<br/>I was saying was that, if you take difference tones of difference<br/>tones and so on ad infinitum, you&apos;ll eventually arrive at the<br/>fundamental tone and never anything lower.</p><p>&gt; &gt; &gt; Since the relations between notes can be given in hertz, I<br/>consider<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; that it can be possible to give instruction to a program as<br/>MIDI or<br/>&gt; &gt; as<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; some numbers, not as wave. Actually, point is to get results as<br/>&gt; &gt; MIDI,<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; or at least as tone names.<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; For instance, all octave intervals give the ground note as<br/>&gt; &gt; difference,<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; as well as major second, major third, perfect fifth and perfect<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; octave, and so on.<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; That program I need would be able to calculate even more complex<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; (four, five, six tone) chords (let us say: C#,D,Eb,Fb,G,Ab) and<br/>get<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; difference tones and than calculate again that difference tones<br/>&gt; &gt; again<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; and again up to the end (the end can be: one tone, one chord,<br/>&gt; &gt; several<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; repeating chords, 12-chord). One can do it manually, but I have<br/>to<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; research some harmonic structures of hundreds of chords and it<br/>can<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; take a lot of time (and mistakes too).<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; Hmm . . . I&apos;m not sure what the difficulty is. But since you say<br/>&gt; &gt; you&apos;re only dealing with nontempered, JI chords, let me ask you:<br/>how<br/>&gt; &gt; do you tune the chord C#,D,Eb,Fb,G,Ab?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I TAKE THE INTERVALS &quot;AS THEY ARE&quot; IN THEIR RELLEVANT RATIOS.</p><p>Which are?</p><p>&gt; &gt; &gt; Do you know if there is anything like that, some software or<br/>plugin?<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; I use PC (win and linux), but at school we have Mac. I am not<br/>good<br/>&gt; &gt; in<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; computing, my skills are almost at zero.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; I&apos;d be happy to write a program for you. Let me know what you&apos;d<br/>like<br/>&gt; &gt; it to accomplish.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; FIRST, LOOK AT THE PICTURE HERE:<br/>&gt; <a href="http://www.adagio.se/differencetones.TIF">www.adagio.se/differencetones.TIF</a><br/>&gt; THERE ARE DIFFERENCE TONES, SIMPLIFIED.</p><p>It seems simplified for one thing because, whether you realize it or<br/>not, you&apos;re allowing the tuning of each note to be &quot;fudged&quot; depending<br/>on context to get the difference tone you want.</p><p>&gt; HERE IS &quot;WHAT I NEED&quot;:<br/>&gt; <a href="http://www.adagio.se/difference-calculation.TIF">www.adagio.se/difference-calculation.TIF</a></p><p>I don&apos;t think this is valid because in general you&apos;ll be assuming<br/>ratio-interpretations for the intervals which are not even consistent<br/>with the possibility of them coexisting in the chord.</p><p>IMO, you&apos;d be far better served actually specifying the notes you&apos;re<br/>using if you&apos;re using JI.

First of all, as far as I had been<br/>reading this till your last message, I thought you were supposing 5-limit<br/>chords in every case. But now, when you have said that the diff. tone of<br/>C-F# should come out as Ab, I&apos;m realizing you&apos;re also taking 7-limit<br/>intervals into account. Now I&apos;m asking: How do you explain this to me that<br/>all the other intervals (except the diminished fourth) are 5-limit ones? And<br/>then, if you say that the diff. tone of C-Bb should come out as Ab, I see<br/>you mean a minor seventh of 9/5 (and not 16/9 as I&apos;d expect). Again, how do<br/>you explain this to the computer? If this is the case, why have you chosen a<br/>major second of 9/8 and not 10/9 then?<br/>Please be more specific about the commatic or kleismatic variants of the<br/>chosen intervals if you wish to work with them.</p><p>Petr</p></div>
