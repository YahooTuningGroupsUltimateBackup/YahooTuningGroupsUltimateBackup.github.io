I notice since then there have been some new<br/>entries added (equally as embarrassing as the earlier ones), so it hasn&apos;t<br/>been a problem of time for the author. He says he encourages comments and<br/>criticisms - maybe if anyone else lets him know of some of the<br/>inaccuracies he&apos;ll fix them. The problem is that some other ignorant sites<br/>have linked to his music pages, and even given it awards, unfortunately.</p><p>With respect to the maths encyclopedia you originally posted about, I<br/>posted a question about its reliability on the newsgroup sci.math. Read<br/>the answers there (the thread is called &quot;treasure trove&quot;), or ask me again<br/>in a few days whether the boffins gave it thumbs-up or not.</p><p>best wishes, Jon</p></div>
