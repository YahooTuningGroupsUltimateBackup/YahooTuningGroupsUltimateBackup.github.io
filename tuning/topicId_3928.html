Does perform on-the-fly retuning as you play.</p><p>   . Does support user chosen tunings.</p><p>   . Because it uses tuning-table modification rather than pitch bends,<br/>     there are not harsh limitations on the number of simultaneous<br/>     voices that can sound (my own software uses pitch bends, which<br/>     requires each pitch of each voice to hog a full GM channel).</p><p>Weaknesses:</p><p>   . Because it uses tuning-table modification rather than pitch bends,<br/>     the program only supports a few specific synthesizers; from their<br/>     web page at <a href="http://www.justonic.com/">http://www.justonic.com/</a></p><p>       . Ensoniq MR series<br/>       . Kurzweil K2000 and K2500<br/>       . Roland GS Series (Sound Canvas, JV 1080, E86, XP10, XP50,<br/>         SCC-1 Sound Card)<br/>       . Yamaha XG series (MU50, MU80, CSIX, QS300,)</p><p>   . It does not support gradual retuning of notes continuously<br/>     sounding (which, to my ear, is almost essential).</p><p>   . With most of the supported synths, it does not even support ANY<br/>     retuning of notes continuously sounding, because the synth applies<br/>     the new tuning table only to new notes.</p><p>I&apos;m not clear whether the program considers new tunings solely upon the<br/>basis of the current (new) set of notes, or whether it also considers<br/>which new tunings are closest to the current (based upon the previous<br/>set of notes) tuning.  The second option is desirable, but, in my<br/>opinion, difficult to implement intelligently without knowing how long<br/>the current (new) set of notes will be sounding.</p><p>Because I also write retuning software, my viewpoint should not be<br/>considered absolutely unbiased.</p><p>JdL</p></div><h3><a id=3966 href="#3966">ðŸ”—</a>John A. deLaubenfels &#x3C;jadl@xxxxxx.xxxx&#x3E;</h3><span>7/16/1999 6:42:16 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>[Carl Lumma, TD 251.2:]<br/>&gt; The Pitch Palette does not have any adaptive JI function, to be<br/>&gt; accurate.  It does have a database of chords (which the user can edit)<br/>&gt; that it can recognize and tune.  I&apos;ve never really used this function.<br/>&gt; Naturally, problems with uniqueness in 12 will still be problems, and<br/>&gt; it treats all inversions of a chord the same, which can be a big<br/>&gt; drawback (C6 vs. Am7, and so on).
