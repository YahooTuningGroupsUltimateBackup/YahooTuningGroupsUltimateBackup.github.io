I have some nice 12-tET guitars (including a Martin) too and I&apos;ll be<br/>playing them at a gig on Saturday. Do you think it would be appropriate if I<br/>advertised that gig here?

There are 340 people here now; do we really have room for everyone&apos;s<br/>&quot;extracurriculars&quot;?</p></div><h3><a id=6723 href="#6723">ðŸ”—</a>Carl Lumma &#x3C;clumma@xxx.xxxx&#x3E;</h3><span>12/7/1999 2:04:10 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>&gt;Is there a policy of what is acceptable on the list? I&apos;ve never received<br/>&gt;any.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;Comments from anybody else?</p><p>While I usually favor a rather strict, narrow definition of subject matter<br/>for e-mail and usenet discussion, the topic of tuning strikes me as a<br/>rather special one.  The economic and social machinery, the number of<br/>fields involved, in bringing about a conscious evaluation of musical tuning<br/>is so great, that as long as the topic is related to music, I don&apos;t see the<br/>harm.  One of the greatest things about this list, in my eyes, has been its<br/>ability to foster the tuning _community_.  If I could go and enjoy a<br/>concert, and know that much more about a certain microtonalist&apos;s approach<br/>to music, and maybe meet him afterwards, then yes, I&apos;d like to know about it.</p><p>Concert announcements are so few on this list, that I don&apos;t think anyone<br/>could complain.  OTOH, several listers have complained, and even left the<br/>list, due to a lack of _musical practice_ being discussed here.<br/>Importantly, I have been to microtonal concerts featuring considerably less<br/>microtonality than the average &quot;normal&quot; concert.</p><p>Finally, there is the old, but good, bandwidth is cheap argument.  How much<br/>does it really take to ignore somebody&apos;s concert announcement?  When there<br/>are so many microtonal concert listings here that I can&apos;t attend all of<br/>them, then I&apos;ll make a motion to narrow the subject matter.</p><p>John, your post was a little vague as to what microtonal content, if any,<br/>it was going to have.  Next time, just open with a word about that.</p><p>-Carl</p></div><h3><a id=10838 href="#10838">ðŸ”—</a>johnlink@con2.com</h3><span>6/21/2000 9:21:18 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>For any of you living in or near Washington, DC, I thought I would pass on<br/>the following announcement. I&apos;m afraid that all the instruments will be<br/>tuned in 12tet, but I think that the event will be interesting anyway.</p><p>John Link</p><p>Burnett Thompson will be conducting a performance tour of the Piano300<br/>collection on Thurs, June 22 and on Saturday, July 1, at 12:00 noon at the<br/>Ripley Bldg., between the Freer and Castle bldgs at the Smithsonian. The<br/>collection includes the original fortepiano, made in 1722, as well as<br/>instruments made in 1768, 1788, and so forth.</p><p>This is a celebration of the 300 yr history of the piano, and includes<br/>original instruments of Mozart, Beethoven, Liszt, Ellington, Berlin,<br/>Liberace, et al. The tours begin at 12 noon and last one hour.</p><p>Part of the beauty of the tour is hearing music of the composers on the<br/>corresponding instrument of their time, often a startling revelation. For<br/>more info, see <a href="http://www.piano300.org">www.piano300.org</a>, the Smithsonian site.</p><p>The repertoire Mr. Thompson will perform includes excerpts from the following:</p><p> Haydn Sonata in Ab<br/> Mozart Sonata in A w/variations<br/> Mozart Sonata in A minor<br/> Beethoven  Fur Elise<br/> Beethoven Moonlight Sonata<br/> Beethoven  Waldstein Sonata<br/> Schubert  Sonata in A minor  DV 845<br/> Schumann  Symphonic Etudes, Scenes from Childhood<br/> Brahms  Piano Concerto #1<br/> Lizst Sonata in B minor<br/> Chopin  Fantasie in F minor, Prelude in A, Fantasie Impromptu, Polonaise<br/> Puccini  Arias  (transcribed by B.T.)<br/> Rachmaninoff Prelude in G minor<br/> Joplin:  Entertainer, Maple Leaf<br/> Gershwin  Rhapsody in Blue<br/> Fats Waller  Ain&apos;t Misbehavin&apos;<br/> Berlin  Cheek to Cheek   (stride)  (on his piano)<br/> Hupfeld   As Time Goes By<br/> Ellington  Just Squeeze Me, A Train, Don&apos;t Get Around, Sweet Mama  (on his<br/>piano)<br/> Billy Joel  She&apos;s Got a Way<br/> Chick Corea   500 miles high (on Fender Rhodes Piano)</p></div>
