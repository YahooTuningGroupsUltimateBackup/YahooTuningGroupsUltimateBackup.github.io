It isn&apos;t a &quot;missing fundamental&quot;, but another<br/>phenomon altogether, not well understood.</p><p>It&apos;s the hum of hte bell, which is quieter note an octave below the<br/>perceived note, while the perceived note usually isn&apos;t present as<br/>a partial at all, according to that bell partials site.</p><p>It would be okay to have that in the experiment, one could have any<br/>cues one likes to lead one to the note. Can have harmonic cues as<br/>well as the inharmonic ones, as it would be pretty much impossible<br/>to eliminate all possible harmonic cues.</p><p>One would know that the inharmonic timbre was responsible because of the<br/>learning period with Timbre 1 needed before one can hear the pitch at s in<br/>timbre 2.</p><p>If it was just the harmonic series responsible for our perception of<br/>pitch, then one would always hear the same pitch in any timbre, no<br/>matter what one heard beforehand, as it would have the same harmonic<br/>content. Or for ones with ambiguous pitches, then the proportions<br/>of times that one hears one or the other pitch wouldn&apos;t depend on<br/>what else one heard before.</p><p>However I think it is possible that one might be influenced in this way.<br/>If one can at all, then it means there is something else to take account<br/>of in pitch perception, and not just the harmonic series, important<br/>though it is.</p><p>I wouldn&apos;t want to go any further and try to develop any theory of<br/>what else might be involved, just suggesting an experiment that<br/>would perhaps show if there is anything else to consider.</p><p>At least, that was the idea in doing it that way.</p><p>Idea is that the inharmonic partials and learning those could<br/>influence the perception of pitch, and that would be what one would<br/>be testing for.</p><p>Is that clear now?</p><p>Robert</p></div>
