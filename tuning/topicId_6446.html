It pertained to a<br/>post forwarded by Kraig (TD 411.3), and a post that I made (TD 406.16)<br/>in response to (or at least inspired by) one by Daniel Wolf (TD<br/>406.10).</p><p>What mostly interests me here are two basic (though somewhat difficult<br/>to express) ideas. The first is what Kraig is calling &quot;the &quot;natural&quot;<br/>organic language of music.&quot; I had recently used the example of Yasser,<br/>who wrote of an evolving (&quot;Raumkunst&quot;) art of space, in an attempt to<br/>express what I believe is the same type of a fundamental pull (or to<br/>quote the post Kraig forwarded: &quot;organic tendency&quot;). The other is the<br/>(often circuitous) ways that music&apos;s development is effected -- &quot;die<br/>erhohung des vorgenfundenen daseins&quot; -- by music&apos;s tools i.e.,<br/>instruments and the curious lot that use them...</p><p>It seems to me that too literal an interpretation of the first idea<br/>(which seems hard to deny) leads more or less (and in Yasser&apos;s case it<br/>was definitely more!) to a deep suspicion (or distrust) of the<br/>second... This was some of Kraig&apos;s off-list response:</p><p>&quot;My main purpose in posting this is its relation of music to language.<br/>The implications is that even though mathematics can be used to<br/>explain this language and add to it. Not all mathematics is applicable<br/>to the &quot;natural&quot; organic language of music. I realize that even those<br/>that<br/>might agree with the premise might on the other hand confine what this<br/>language is. Fortunately we have enough cultures on the globe as<br/>modals of different ways this language can develop . . . it seems that<br/>no tuning and/or acoustical phenomena has a monopoly for creating a<br/>musical language. It appears that the those instruments whether (for<br/>instance) strings divided into ratios or flutes with equally spaced<br/>wholes have had great influence on how scales have developed. It would<br/>I feel would be a mistake on the other hand to think that any<br/>instrument with its inherent formula would be as appealing or withstan<br/>d any test in length of time.&quot;</p><p>As I&apos;m typing this I&apos;m listening to Huun-Huur-Tu&apos;s _OSKE CHERDE_, and<br/>it&apos;s striking me how the pulse of the tune is so vividly saturated<br/>with the rhythm (and decidedly human habit) of horse riding... I truly<br/>believe that our ability to animate our experiences and our<br/>inspirations is also the potential to change music... to change what<br/>is musically possible... what is musically right... So I guess I&apos;d<br/>have to say that once the question is boiled down to a very simple<br/>scheme (&quot;chomsky&apos;s symbolic formulation of language and subsequent<br/>mapping of diverse languages into a very simple scheme argues strongly<br/>for an organic origin of language structure . . . the above arguments<br/>merely suggest that there may be an organic tendency towards certain<br/>scales and musics as there probably is for language structure&quot;), I for<br/>one am probably apt to be as interested in wrong answers as I am<br/>right...</p><p>How any of this might be said to relate to intonation and tuning is (I<br/>think) a very interesting topic for discussion.</p><p>Dan</p><p>-Ode to Lou Ferrigno...</p><p>HUUN-HUUR-TU are my five-year-old son Bryan&apos;s favorite band... he<br/>calls them &quot;the singing horsemen,&quot; and often lurches into his own<br/>(language unknown) interpretations of their songs... last week his<br/>mother and grandmother simultaneously forbade any<br/>&quot;errrrrrr-eeeeeeee&apos;s&quot; when his fathers not around. He wanted to be<br/>K-ool for Halloween but ended up settling on the Incredible Hulk -- he<br/>recently unearthed all my old (late &apos;60s early &apos;70s) comics that I got<br/>on my summers vacations to Hampton Beach... And while I personally<br/>wanted to take him over to DC comics so we could kick Batman and<br/>Superman&apos;s ass - we just ended up going out and getting a couple dozen<br/>candy bars and lollypops... And thanks to the unspeakably omnipresent<br/>influence of TV on peoples collective know-what-they-know (there was<br/>an &apos;80s TV show based on the comic), most everyone seemed to know who<br/>he was supposed to be despite the fact that he was festooned in all of<br/>a green sweatshirt and some not quite right green face paint. I guess<br/>we&apos;ll probably wait until HUUN-HUUR-TU get themselves a TV show before<br/>we try and wing a Kaigal-ool costume... Oh well, peace love and gamma<br/>radiation.</p></div>
