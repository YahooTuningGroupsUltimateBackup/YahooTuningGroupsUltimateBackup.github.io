Schulter &#x3C;MSCHULTER@VALUE.NET&#x3E;</h3><span>8/18/2000 2:35:05 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Hello, there, and in response to some previous discussion, I&apos;d like<br/>briefly to comment on why the Pythagorean major third or ditone at<br/>81:64 (~407.82 cents) can fit so nicely into the kinds of complex<br/>3-limit Gothic and neo-Gothic styles which I practice.</p><p>Here there may be two sides to the question: the nature of the<br/>historical tradition, and my more personal experiences and impressions<br/>as I practice it. Maybe the second aspect is a better place to begin.</p><p>In a Gothic or neo-Gothic setting where fifths and fourths and<br/>complete trines (2:3:4) set the standard of rich and saturated<br/>concord, I find that prominent sonorities with Pythagorean thirds are<br/>at once relatively concordant or blending and yet unstable, nicely<br/>whetting my anticipation of motion to a new stable sonority.</p><p>Please let me make it very clear that prominent cadential and other<br/>sonorities including Pythagorean major and minor thirds -- the latter<br/>at 32:27 (~294.13 cents) -- are a routine and essential feature of<br/>multi-voice Gothic polyphony from Perotin to Ciconia and his<br/>colleagues, or about 1200-1420.</p><p>These sonorities are unstable, dynamic, and absolutely essential to<br/>the vertical color and cadential action of the music -- as integral an<br/>element as the various sonorities with sevenths from Corelli to<br/>Beethoven.</p><p>In a relatively recent post, Kraig Grady discussed how the language<br/>used by musicians of a given tradition (e.g. Javanese or Balinese<br/>gamelan) may ideally express that artistic framework. In trying to<br/>express somewhat ineffable musical experiences, which may be radically<br/>alien to others in concept and perception, I can empathize with the<br/>dilemmas of Pierre Lamothe in confronting a different kind of natural<br/>language barrier.</p><p>To me, the sonority 64:81:96 or 54:64:81 is what Jacobus terms it: a<br/>_quinta fissa_ or &quot;split fifth&quot; (e.g. F3-A3-C4, A3-C4-E4) divided into<br/>two relatively blending and pleasantly unstable thirds.</p><p>Many writers of the 13th and 14th centuries describe these thirds as<br/>&quot;imperfect concords,&quot; or sometimes (Jacobus) &quot;medial concords&quot; -- they<br/>&quot;are heard to differ greatly, and yet concord&quot; (Franco of Cologne,<br/>c. 1260?).</p><p>The modern term &quot;semi-concord&quot; seems very felicitous to me also. As<br/>Johannes Boen so aptly writes in 1357, thirds and also sixths are<br/>&quot;messengers and handmaidens&quot; heralding the arrival of their purer<br/>sister concords, the fifth and octave.</p><p>Since this discussion has largely focused on the _quinta fissa_, I<br/>might just cite a cadence from a setting of _Haec dies_ maybe a bit<br/>after 1200 in a more or less Perotinian style which beautifully<br/>illustrates this point:</p><p>     D4  E4<br/>     B3  A3<br/>     G3  A3</p><p>  (M3-1 + m3-5)</p><p>Here the musical grammar, which has been &quot;second nature&quot; to me for<br/>some 30 years of listening, improvising, and composing, makes the<br/>first sonority the pleasant and stirring _avant-coureur_ of a stable<br/>sonority to follow, here a fifth (the choicest trinic interval). This<br/>passage virtually sent shivers up my spine when I heard it performed<br/>as part of a series on music featuring Yehudi Menuhin maybe 20 years<br/>ago.</p><p>While the grammar and logic does not depend on the precise tuning, the<br/>Pythagorean third gives this passage &quot;bounce&quot; or &quot;natural reverb,&quot; as<br/>I might put it.</p><p>In forms such as the 13th-century conductus and motet we may sometimes<br/>have a chain of two or three _quinta fissa_ sonorities leading up to a<br/>standard cadence:</p><p>1  &amp;  2   3  | 1<br/>E4 D4 C4  B3   A3<br/>B3    A3  G3   A3<br/>E3    F3  E3   D3</p><p>        (M3-1 + m3-5)</p><p>Interestingly, my ears may focus on the relatively blending quality of<br/>the thirds at least as much as on their element of tension -- which<br/>seems to me quite natural, given that they are semi-concordant but<br/>unstable.</p><p>Major and minor thirds also occur in a variety of sonorities, some<br/>very important for cadences, where they are mixed with more tense<br/>intervals including seconds, sixths, and sevenths. For much more on<br/>this, please see:</p><p><a href="http://www.medieval.org/emfaq/harmony/13c.html">http://www.medieval.org/emfaq/harmony/13c.html</a><br/><a href="http://www.medieval.org/emfaq/harmony/pyth.html">http://www.medieval.org/emfaq/harmony/pyth.html</a></p><p>To me, both the instability of thirds in this music and their pleasant<br/>quality as Pythagorean &quot;semi-concords&quot; are routine features of a style<br/>deeply ingrained within me. Might these two perceptions, or<br/>conceptions, be intimately related -- and likewise the perplexity of<br/>listeners who may take the stability of thirds as &quot;second nature,&quot; and<br/>find Gothic musical style _and_ intonation &quot;out of tune&quot; with their<br/>deeply ingrained expectations?</p><p>Might musicians accustomed to Paul Erlich&apos;s decatonic music with its<br/>stable 4:5:6:7 tetrads ask with some trepidation or at least<br/>bewilderment how European musicians could remain satisfied with &quot;such<br/>egregiously out-of-tune minor sevenths at 9:5 or 16:9&quot;?</p><p>Would they analyze the factors of pitch range, beat rates, and melodic<br/>ornamentation in Mozart which might make his &quot;5-limit tetrads&quot; somehow<br/>more bearable?</p><p>Might some passionate lover of Mozart gently point out that referring<br/>to these same sonorities as &quot;seventh chords&quot; is not just a matter of<br/>18th-century &quot;musicological correctness,&quot; but a difference in musical<br/>perception and experience -- however ineffable and possibly<br/>untransmissible?</p><p>The term egregious, for me, can also have its original Latin meaning:<br/>_egregi-us/a/um_ means &quot;standing out from the herd or flock,&quot; much<br/>like the English &quot;outstanding.&quot;</p><p>In this sense, I find Pythagorean thirds in the _quinta fissa_ and<br/>other Gothic sonorities to be outstandingly suited to the music.<br/>This is a happy feature of Pythagorean JI: two pure 9:8 tones just<br/>happen to make a very nice semi-concordant major third.</p><p>For some other people, however, these same intervals can be egregious<br/>in the usual Modern English sense -- which I might here translate as<br/>&quot;outstandingly out-of-tune with musical and intonational expectations<br/>premised on stable thirds.&quot;</p><p>Of course, there are interesting collateral matters: the very relative<br/>nature of pitch in the medieval era; the various ranges which<br/>ensembles of men, women, boys, portative organs, and other instruments<br/>may have used in performance; the total range of about G2-D5 (G-d&apos;&apos;)<br/>for pieces in the Montpellier Codex, with the largest usual vertical<br/>interval or overall range for a given piece rarely exceeding about a<br/>twelfth.</p><p>However, I suspect that the basic issue is one of deep acculturation<br/>and habit -- something very different from crude bias or prejudice, I<br/>would strongly emphasize.</p><p>Similarly, I must confess my comic difficulties with basic French<br/>phonology, quite natural to native French speakers at least since the<br/>era around 814 when clerics recognized the _lingua rustica Romana_ as<br/>a distinct tongue whose use would promote intelligible communication.<br/>Native speakers of many languages may have yet greater difficulties<br/>with English phonology.</p><p>Please let me add that my own perceptions may be rather &quot;bilingual.&quot;<br/>Pythagorean thirds (and sixths) seem &quot;as natural as the air&quot; to me in<br/>most Gothic polyphony -- but curiously &quot;ruffled&quot; or &quot;peculiar&quot; for<br/>16th-century music, telling me that I neglected to switch the<br/>synthesizer to meantone.</p><p>For me, either intonational phonology is &quot;natural&quot; for its musical<br/>style or language.</p><p>Most respectfully,</p><p>Margo Schulter<br/><a href="mailto:mschulter@value.net">mschulter@value.net</a></p></div>
