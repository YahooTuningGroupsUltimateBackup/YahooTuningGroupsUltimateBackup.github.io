I have an insanely crazy idea for this one; won&apos;t have the money for the extra gear needed before the cut off date, but I&apos;ll submit something.</p><p>Enormous thanks for the link!</p><p>Some interesting mixers:<br/>(this one has been out for over a year, but it might surprise considering Allen &amp; Heath are new to the DJ market)<br/><a href="http://www.allen-heath.com/xone/xone464.htm">http://www.allen-heath.com/xone/xone464.htm</a></p><p>An interesting concept, but it has too many negative &quot;gotchas&quot; for me.</p><p>--Catharsis</p><p>Egregious<br/>&quot;Spiritual renewal through music for those outside the heard.&quot;<br/><a href="http://www.egregious.net/">http://www.egregious.net/</a></p></div>
