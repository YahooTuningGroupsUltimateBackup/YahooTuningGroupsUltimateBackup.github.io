I really don&apos;t think we can be accused of that in regard to<br/>the development of sagittal. I feel that all the energy so far has<br/>gone into _getting_it_right_ from the point of view of utility,<br/>simplicity, readability, completeness etc.</p><p>&gt; I can&apos;t see the point in rushing to replace the 12-tET standard<br/>&gt; that&apos;s caused so many problems with any other standard.</p><p>The Sagittal notation system allows for _augmenting_ rather than<br/>replacing 12-tET-based notation, if that&apos;s what you want to do.</p><p>But if you think 12-tET-based notation has caused so many problems<br/>then why wouldn&apos;t you want to replace it? And who is rushing? People<br/>have been inventing limited microtonal notations for over a hundred<br/>years. Many have been surveyed by Prof Gardner Read in his book &quot;20th<br/>Century Microtonal Notations&quot;. George and I and many others who helped<br/>in the project, (including your good self) have been thinking about<br/>notation issues for years, and have built on the lessons learned in<br/>many of the earlier attempts. Sagittal attempts to allow the same<br/>semantics as most special-purpose notations that have ever been used<br/>before, but with a consistent set of accidental symbols used across<br/>all of them.</p><p>&gt;  George<br/>&gt; has argued that a standard is necessary for progress.  I don&apos;t<br/>&gt; believe it.</p><p>I don&apos;t think he would have said &quot;necessary&quot;, or if he did, I don&apos;t<br/>think he meant it in the mathematical sense. Don&apos;t you think a<br/>standard might be beneficial? If you&apos;re concerned that it may be too<br/>limiting, wait until you understand its full scope.</p><p>The only thing I can think of that it won&apos;t do, is something<br/>semantically equivalent to Johnston notation, where the nominals are<br/>assumed to be in the 5-limit JI major.<br/> A E B<br/>F C G D<br/>Sagittal does assume that the nominals (and there could be more than<br/>7) form a linear (or very nearly linear) sequence.</p><p>Since no-one can be forced to use it, it must stand or fall on its own<br/>merits. But that isn&apos;t much use if no one knows what those merits are,<br/>because we&apos;re accused of &quot;advocacy&quot; when we try to explain.</p><p>&gt; What I mean by the &quot;last thing&quot; is, instead of &apos;we need a<br/>&gt; standard to have music&apos;, I&apos;d rather, &apos;we have so much music we<br/>&gt; need a standard to keep it from falling apart&apos;.</p><p>Yes. The latter may already be true.</p><p>&gt; Like the C language -- it was so popular, they created a<br/>&gt; standard... in 1988! (or something).  As opposed to Java, which<br/>&gt; Sun controls, and pushes with a huge hype machine.  It&apos;s utterly<br/>&gt; failed to deliver on its promise to deliver end-user apps.</p><p>You can rest assured there will be no huge hype machine behind<br/>sagittal. It&apos;s a free product designed by volunteers in their spare<br/>time, and still open to improvement.</p><p>&gt; Or maybe, &apos;I&apos;ve transcribed every microtonal composition I<br/>&gt; could get my hands on into universal notation X, and made deals<br/>&gt; with many composers that in exchange for the transcription,<br/>&gt; the scores shall be freely available on the universal notation<br/>&gt; X website.&apos;</p><p>I&apos;m not sure I follow. Are you saying that in order to get people<br/>interested in using the sagittal notation system, we&apos;re not only going<br/>to have to design it for free, but provide a free transcription<br/>service? I&apos;m so exhausted from helping design it that it&apos;s quite an<br/>effort now to push on and actually write it up and _explain_ it.

Care to rebut that?</p><p>In my message:<br/><a href="/tuning-math/message/5267">/tuning-math/message/5267</a><br/>I drew the following conclusion:</p><p>&lt;&lt;  The broader point that I was trying to make seems to have gotten<br/>lost in all of the details of the discussion.  I was trying to show<br/>that there is no particular advantage in using decimal notation to<br/>notate music that is *not* based on the Miracle geometry (e.g.,<br/>Partch&apos;s music, which is better understood in reference to an 11-<br/>limit tonality diamond), but for which the tones may still be very<br/>suitably mapped onto a decimal keyboard.  The advantage of decimal<br/>notation comes into effect only when and if you are using the Miracle<br/>temperament itself, i.e., exploiting the tonal relationships that are<br/>unique to Miracle.  Likewise, if I play something in 31, 41, or 72-ET<br/>on a decimal keyboard that was composed by someone utterly ignorant<br/>of Miracle as an organizing principle for tonality (as I believe<br/>*all* of us were up until a couple of years ago -- myself included),<br/>is the decimal notation going to benefit me in any way if the<br/>composition which I am playing was not conceived as being decatonic?<br/>I think not.  These three divisions can be treated as *either*<br/>heptatonic *or* decatonic, and I could even show you a unidecatonic<br/>MOS subset of 31-ET (with a very useful tetrad that occurs in 5<br/>places).  But it would be unrealistic to expect anyone to learn three<br/>different notations for one tonal system, according to which tonal<br/>relationships are exploited in a given piece.  (Or suppose that a<br/>piece is heptatonic in one place and decatonic in another.  Do we<br/>switch notations in the middle of the page?)</p><p>My point is that alternate tunings often do not tie us down to<br/>specific tonal organizations, so the choice of a tuning is often not<br/>enough to determine how many nominals would be &quot;best&quot; for its<br/>notation.  Since we are already acquainted with a notation that uses<br/>7 nominals, and if that works reasonably well for many alternative<br/>tunings, then why not have a generalized notation that builds on that?</p><p>So I would therefore require a microtonal musician to learn no more<br/>than one new notation.  A composer may wish to do otherwise when<br/>composing, but a translation would be provided for the player.  &gt;&gt;</p><p>Here is a portion of your reply from:<br/><a href="/tuning-math/message/5272">/tuning-math/message/5272</a><br/>with my present comments.</p><p>&gt; &gt;[GS:]<br/>&gt; &gt;The issue that I raise is: how many different notations can you<br/>&gt; &gt;expect a person to learn?<br/>&gt; [CL:]<br/>&gt; As many as he needs to play the music he wants to.</p><p>Not the answer I expected!  In the real world I believe that a<br/>performer would want to have to learn as *few* different notations as<br/>possible.  So if it is possible to design a single notation that can<br/>notate many different tunings reasonably well, then I believe it<br/>should be done.</p><p>&gt; [GS:]<br/>&gt; &gt;But it would be unrealistic to expect anyone to learn three<br/>&gt; &gt;different notations for one tonal system, according to which<br/>&gt; &gt;tonal relationships are exploited in a given piece.<br/>&gt; [CL:]<br/>&gt; Perhaps we&apos;ll have to agree to disagree.</p><p>Which is evidently where we&apos;re still at.</p><p>&gt; [GS:]<br/>&gt; &gt;(Or suppose that a piece is heptatonic in one place and decatonic<br/>&gt; &gt;in another.

What I ended up with was<br/>so unconventional, both with respect to our present way of thinking<br/>harmonically (by prime factors in ratios) and to the harmonic<br/>meanings of the sagittal symbols themselves, that I could only<br/>conclude that it was not worth the trouble even for a composer to use<br/>decimal notation.  The Miracle relationships (involving commas and<br/>decimal nominals) can easily be discerned by using a diagram of the<br/>decimal keyboard labeled with a 72-ET notation (using 7 nominals,<br/>sagittal or otherwise) -- and this is something that Joseph Pehrson<br/>ought to be using.</p><p>So, to repeat your assertion:</p><p>&gt; But also in that thread, I assert that by forcing 7 nominals, you<br/>&gt; ruin the mapping from commas to accidentals.

The octatonic<br/>&gt; music of the 20th century does provide such an example.</p><p>OK. I think I get it now. I think you&apos;re saying that we can&apos;t claim<br/>that conventional notation has been used historically in a manner<br/>independent of any particular temperament, because it has always been<br/>used for chains of fifths, even though one is Pythagorean and another<br/>is meantone. And the only thing you can think of that supports such an<br/>argument from history is octatonic.</p><p>Well, you can have it that way if you like, because I have already<br/>said that even without a history that includes Pythagorean and<br/>meantone, the fifth is still the best overall choice for notational<br/>generator. I&apos;ll explain why below.</p><p>&gt; &gt;&gt; Let&apos;s consider the 7-tone diatonic in meantone with 6 nominals --<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt; let&apos;s cut B.  B is a 9/8 (or any of its 81:80 variants) from A,<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt; or a 16/15 (or any of its 81:80 variants) from C.  By using the<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt; 25:24 accidental to get these motions, you&apos;re messing with the<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt; mapping from commas to accidentals.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;Using what 24:25 accidental to get what motions, in what way?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; To get the pitch formerly known as B!  Show us how it&apos;s done.  How<br/>&gt; do you notate diatonic music with six nominals in an acceptable<br/>&gt; manner?</p><p>Why would I want to? With the fifth as the generator of nominals, the<br/>natural number of nominals is 7. 6 is improper. You say &quot;By doing X<br/>you&apos;re doing a bad thing&quot;. And I say &quot;But I&apos;m not doing X&quot;. And you<br/>say &quot;Do X&quot;. This isn&apos;t making much sense to me. Sorry.</p><p>To notate the note a fifth above E in an open meantone (or in<br/>Pythagorean), without using the letter B, I would use an accidental<br/>that primarily represented a Pythagorean limma (2^8/3^5), and then B<br/>would be C-limma-down. Then I would only need 5 nominals. But I don&apos;t<br/>see what point you are trying to make here.</p><p>&gt; &gt;The fifth (or equivalently the twelfth) is the best general-purpose<br/>&gt; &gt;notational generator, not because it comes from a good temperament<br/>&gt; &gt;(e.g meantone), but because it is the simplest rational interval after<br/>&gt; &gt;the octave. i.e. simply because it is the next prime.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; You keep saying this, but not why you think it&apos;s true.  A little<br/>&gt; reflection should show that your reasoning here leads you down the<br/>&gt; same path as searching for good linear temperaments.  You didn&apos;t<br/>&gt; restrict yourself to the octave and fifth then<br/>...</p><p>No. A little reflection allows me to explain that, as it stands now,<br/>the semantic foundations of Sagittal notation have absolutely nothing<br/>to do with any temperament. It isn&apos;t surprising that you might think<br/>otherwise, since George and I were confused about that ourselves for a<br/>very long time.</p><p>You may remember that around the same time that George first presented<br/>a proto-sagittal as a notation primarily for certain popular ETs up to<br/>and including 72-ET, Gene was looking for good sets of commas for a<br/>one-accidental-per-comma-per-prime notation for ratios. And the two<br/>ideas cross-fertilised.</p><p>We quickly got beyond 72-ET, but for a very long time there was a<br/>constant tension between basing the notation on some equal temperament<br/>versus basing it on ratios and thereby keeping it open. The problem<br/>with a notation based on ratios is that, to keep everyone happy, you<br/>need a huge number of different accidentals, or you need to allow long<br/>strings of accidentals, possibly pointing in contradictory directions,<br/>against a single note. So it is natural to want to close the system by<br/>making the accidentals refer to notes of some temperament. This has<br/>been done before, but someone always finds the temperament to be too<br/>limiting. Kraig eloquently made this point quite recently.</p><p>In the development of Sagittal, you probably remember 217-ET being<br/>mentioned a lot at one stage, and later 494-ET and 612-ET, and even<br/>1600-ET. So we kept stretching and stretching the<br/>temperament-connection until finally, in May this year, it snapped.</p><p>One of the last things to go was George&apos;s 5*7*13-schismina (4095:4096,<br/>0.4 c) which was a source of much economy in the notation. I came up<br/>with symbols that fitted the overall system but that allowed ratios of<br/>13 to be notated differently from the nearby ratios of 35. George<br/>wrote at the time that this was &quot;both upsetting and intriguing&quot;.</p><p>We soon realised we could have our cake and eat it too - that every<br/>symbol could represent a single unique comma ratio but that users who<br/>want to notate rational tunings are free to choose larger or smaller<br/>sets of symbols to trade off economy-of-symbols against<br/>accuracy-of-representation (for those ratios which are not represented<br/>exactly by the chosen symbols). We then set about standardising a few<br/>such sets. One of them, the Athenian set, which you can see in Scala<br/>right now, looks suspiciously like the old 217-ET set. But that&apos;s<br/>because it makes sense to choose subsets where the commas are<br/>relatively evenly spaced, and that meet certain other criteria. But<br/>there is a big difference between looking to temperaments to help<br/>choose good subsets, and basing the whole notation system on a<br/>particular temperament.</p><p>We have also used a temperament to help decide on the actual symbols<br/>to be used for the comma ratios in the superset. This is an<br/>8-dimensional temperament with a maximum error of 0.39 cents. The 8<br/>dimensions relate to the 9 flags (including the accent mark) that make<br/>up the symbols, less one degree of freedom because a certain<br/>combination is set equal to the apotome. But again, this is in the<br/>symbology, not the semantics, so there is nothing to prevent someone<br/>in the future from deciding that they need unique symbols for more<br/>ratios, and extending the system with another flag type representing<br/>something around half a cent. But we find this fairly unlikely and for<br/>practical reasons (of making fonts etc.) we have closed the superset<br/>for now with _only_ about 600 symbols!</p><p>So the first part of my belief is that it is far better to have a<br/>notation system whose semantics are based on precise ratios and then<br/>use that to also notate temperaments, rather than trying to find the<br/>ultimate temperament and then using a notation based on that to notate<br/>both ratios and other temperaments.</p><p>Then if that&apos;s accepted, the second part is that it is best if the<br/>simplest or most popular ratios have the simplest notations. The<br/>properties of simplicity and popularity are so much in alignment in<br/>regard to ratios of the lowest primes that we don&apos;t really need to<br/>decide which one we mean. I understand that you agree with this, and<br/>so it should be obvious that the simplest accidental is no accidental<br/>at all and so the simplest ratios should be represented by nominals<br/>alone. When we agree that powers of 2 will not be represented at all,<br/>or will be represented by an octave number, or by a distance of N<br/>staff positions or a clef, then surely you agree that the next<br/>simplest thing is to represent powers of three by the nominals.</p><p>So I imagine it&apos;s the first part of my belief that you want more<br/>argument for.</p><p>Well I think the fact that we have Graham proposing MIRACLE<br/>temperament with 10 nominals and Gene proposing ennealimmal<br/>temperament with 9 nominals should make it clear that there is<br/>unlikely to ever be agreement on which is the ultimate temperament for<br/>notating everything else including ratios.</p><p>You seem to have been assuming that George and I were merely<br/>championing some other (fifth-generated) temperament as the ultimate<br/>for notating everything else. I hope I have explained why this is not so.</p><p>But there may well be some merit in notating a linear temperament<br/>using a natural number of nominals for that temperament and<br/>accidentals representing chromatic commas that arise from that choice<br/>of nominals in that temperament. And this can certainly be done using<br/>sagittal accidentals.</p><p>It&apos;s only when we start trying to apply such a temperament-based<br/>notation to things for which the temperament mapping does not predict<br/>the best approximations to the simplest ratios, that it comes unstuck.<br/>For example when Graham applies a 10-nominal MIRACLE-based notation to<br/>22-ET, in two different ways, I find it very unclear what the<br/>accidentals really mean (across tunings) and what the rules are. But<br/>go ahead and work on it if you want.</p></div><h3><a id=47430 href="#47430">ðŸ”—</a>Joseph Pehrson &#x3C;jpehrson@rcn.com&#x3E;</h3><span>9/30/2003 6:04:22 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;Paul Erlich&quot; &lt;paul@s...&gt; wrote:</p><p><a href="/tuning/topicId_46826.html#47419">/tuning/topicId_46826.html#47419</a></p><p>&gt; --- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;Joseph Pehrson&quot; &lt;jpehrson@r...&gt;<br/>wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; ***Hi Paul!<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; I&apos;m glad you&apos;re making me think about this, since I&apos;m obviously<br/>&gt; &gt; stumbling all over myself... :)<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; OK, so I mean the secor, the Miracle generator:<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; What you&apos;re saying is when you let it continue on 72 times then<br/>it<br/>&gt; &gt; *does* close since it&apos;s practically equal to 72 steps, yes?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; yes, usually it&apos;s either exactly equal to, or quite close to, 7<br/>steps<br/>&gt; of 72-equal.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; And how close is it *exactly* to 72-tET in it&apos;s 72 step<br/>&gt; &gt;incarnation??<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; just as there is an infinite variety of meantone generators<br/>&gt; (including the *exact* fifth of 31-equal -- why not?), there is<br/>also<br/>&gt; an infinite variety of miracle generators (including *exactly* 7/72-<br/>&gt; octave). but since we call the latter the secor after george secor,<br/>&gt; we might as well use as one example george&apos;s choice,<br/>&gt; <a href="http://www.sonic-arts.org/dict/secor.htm">http://www.sonic-arts.org/dict/secor.htm</a><br/>&gt; 116.715594098207 cents<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; and as an additional example the 9-limit rms optimum<br/>&gt; <a href="/tuning/topicId_22626.html#22626">/tuning/topicId_22626.html#22626</a><br/>&gt; 116.729676636048 cents<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; the first differs from 7/72 octave by 0.05 cents; stacked 72 times<br/>&gt; and octave-reduced, it misses the starting point by 3.53 cents.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; the second differs from 7/72 octave by 0.06 cents; stacked 72 times<br/>&gt; and octave reduced, it missed the starting point by 4.54 cents.</p><p>***Thanks, Paul, for this info. and sorry about my momentary<br/>confusion (temporary insanity...)</p><p>It&apos;s pretty clear in my mind now...</p><p>Joseph</p></div><h3><a id=47432 href="#47432">ðŸ”—</a>Carl Lumma &#x3C;ekin@lumma.org&#x3E;</h3><span>9/30/2003 6:09:10 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>&gt;even if the comma is tempered out, you&apos;ll still need more accidental<br/>&gt;pairs if you want to notate a higher-dimensional tuning system -- one<br/>&gt;which represents N more primes and tempers out less than N more<br/>&gt;independent commas.</p><p>Yup.</p><p>-Carl</p></div><h3><a id=47437 href="#47437">ðŸ”—</a>Carl Lumma &#x3C;ekin@lumma.org&#x3E;</h3><span>9/30/2003 6:44:46 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>&gt;OK.

Sorry.</p><p>But you are (or were) advocating doing X, but trying to force 7<br/>nominals on other scales.  It is, as you say, improper to do so.  Which<br/>is what I was trying to point out.  It looks as though I&apos;ve succeeded!</p><p>&gt;&gt; &gt;The fifth (or equivalently the twelfth) is the best general-purpose<br/>&gt;&gt; &gt;notational generator, not because it comes from a good temperament<br/>&gt;&gt; &gt;(e.g meantone), but because it is the simplest rational interval<br/>&gt;&gt; &gt;after the octave. i.e. simply because it is the next prime.<br/>&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt; You keep saying this, but not why you think it&apos;s true.  A little<br/>&gt;&gt; reflection should show that your reasoning here leads you down the<br/>&gt;&gt; same path as searching for good linear temperaments.  You didn&apos;t<br/>&gt;&gt; restrict yourself to the octave and fifth then<br/>&gt;...<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;No. A little reflection allows me to explain that, as it stands now,<br/>&gt;the semantic foundations of Sagittal notation have absolutely nothing<br/>&gt;to do with any temperament.</p><p>I should have said, &quot;good PBs&quot; there.  [I think of PBs as temperaments,<br/>which always gets me into trouble.]</p><p>&gt;We quickly got beyond 72-ET, but for a very long time there was a<br/>&gt;constant tension between basing the notation on some equal temperament<br/>&gt;versus basing it on ratios and thereby keeping it open. The problem<br/>&gt;with a notation based on ratios is that, to keep everyone happy, you<br/>&gt;need a huge number of different accidentals,</p><p>With, say, 19-limit JI, I don&apos;t see a way around this.</p><p>With linear temperaments, you only need 1 accidental pair at a time,<br/>as I&apos;ve pointed out.  The particular comma involved will depend on<br/>the limit and the number of notes in the base scale.  This could be<br/>handled two ways.  The first way I suggested is to get a list of simple<br/>19-limit commas and assign accidental pairs to them.  The same<br/>accidentals could be used for planar temperaments, JI, whatever, with<br/>more than one pair in use at a time.</p><p>If average use (&quot;gimme 9 notes of such-and-such temperament in the<br/>13-limit&quot;) turns out to require more commas than can fit on a list,<br/>you could try assigning (an) accidental(s) for each *temperament*,<br/>with the understanding that it/they would take on TM-reduced value(s)<br/>for the limit and scale cardinality being used.</p><p>&gt;We soon realised we could have our cake and eat it too - that every<br/>&gt;symbol could represent a single unique comma ratio but that users who<br/>&gt;want to notate rational tunings are free to choose larger or smaller<br/>&gt;sets of symbols to trade off economy-of-symbols against<br/>&gt;accuracy-of-representation (for those ratios which are not represented<br/>&gt;exactly by the chosen symbols).</p><p>Great.  That&apos;s the master list idea.</p><p>&gt;We have also used a temperament to help decide on the actual symbols<br/>&gt;to be used for the comma ratios in the superset. This is an<br/>&gt;8-dimensional temperament</p><p>Representing how many harmonic dimensions?</p><p>&gt;So the first part of my belief is that it is far better to have a<br/>&gt;notation system whose semantics are based on precise ratios and then<br/>&gt;use that to also notate temperaments, rather than trying to find the<br/>&gt;ultimate temperament and then using a notation based on that to notate<br/>&gt;both ratios and other temperaments.</p><p>Wow; this is exactly what I&apos;ve been saying all along!!</p><p>&gt;Then if that&apos;s accepted, the second part is that it is best if the<br/>&gt;simplest or most popular ratios have the simplest notations.</p><p>Right.  And it&apos;s this aspect that makes the search more-or-less<br/>equivalent to the search for good PBs.</p><p>&gt;I understand that you agree with this, and so it should be obvious<br/>&gt;that the simplest accidental is no accidental at all and so the<br/>&gt;simplest ratios should be represented by nominals alone. When we<br/>&gt;agree that powers of 2 will not be represented at all, or will be<br/>&gt;represented by an octave number, or by a distance of N staff positions<br/>&gt;or a clef, then surely you agree that the next simplest thing is to<br/>&gt;represent powers of three by the nominals.</p><p>Well, that&apos;s a weighted-complexity approach.  But even with most<br/>weighted-complexity lists I&apos;ve seen, non-rational-generator<br/>temperaments appear.</p><p>&gt;Well I think the fact that we have Graham proposing MIRACLE<br/>&gt;temperament with 10 nominals and Gene proposing ennealimmal<br/>&gt;temperament with 9 nominals should make it clear that there is<br/>&gt;unlikely to ever be agreement on which is the ultimate temperament<br/>&gt;for notating everything else including ratios.</p><p>It was the ultimate-temperament aspect of the project I objected<br/>to since the beginning!</p><p>&gt;You seem to have been assuming that George and I were merely<br/>&gt;championing some other (fifth-generated) temperament as the<br/>&gt;ultimate for notating everything else. I hope I have explained<br/>&gt;why this is not so.</p><p>Ok, ok, I think we&apos;re more on the same page now.  But certainly<br/>the project didn&apos;t start out this way, and even in the last few<br/>days I saw a blurb for George and/or you looking very confused<br/>about non-heptatonic systems.</p><p>-Carl</p></div><h3><a id=47438 href="#47438">ðŸ”—</a>Kurt Bigler &#x3C;kkb@breathsense.com&#x3E;</h3><span>9/30/2003 7:15:19 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>on 9/25/03 12:00 PM, <a href="mailto:Afmmjr@aol.com">Afmmjr@aol.com</a> &lt;<a href="mailto:Afmmjr@aol.com">Afmmjr@aol.com</a>&gt; wrote:</p><p>&gt; In a message dated 9/25/2003 2:13:18 PM Eastern Daylight Time,<br/>&gt; <a href="mailto:gdsecor@yahoo.com">gdsecor@yahoo.com</a> writes:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt; Johnny, I&apos;m curious about something.  If you don&apos;t use your cents<br/>&gt;&gt; notation for a keyboard instrument, then what notation would you use<br/>&gt;&gt; for a non-traditional keyboard instrument (such as your generalized<br/>&gt;&gt; keyboard that is currently under construction), if the tuning to be<br/>&gt;&gt; notated is one that cannot be adequately notated by either a<br/>&gt;&gt; quartertone or meantone notation (e.g., a 22 or 29-tone octave, not<br/>&gt;&gt; necessarily an ET)?<br/>&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Hello George:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; You raise a good point.  This yet needs to be thought out.  Clearly, any<br/>&gt; composer can notate any which way as there is no notation authority.  At least<br/>&gt; standard notation with cents deviations indicated will still work.  However,<br/>&gt; there may be a more tabulature-like streamlining possible.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; best, Johnny Reinhard</p><p>Yes, I&apos;m just getting caught up on my email too...</p><p>I also wanted to comment on this.  Carl and I are working on getting the<br/>&quot;xmw&quot; spec fleshed out and implemented on my softsynth organ.  So a<br/>&quot;12-tone&quot; keyboard ceases to be a &quot;fixed pitch&quot; scenario.  I&apos;m looking<br/>forward to being able to have automatically generated notation driven from<br/>the xmw-style MIDI input - thought this is still a bit of a dream at this<br/>moment.</p><p>(I assume you all talked about the xmw thing a long time ago - I wasn&apos;t here<br/>then.)</p><p>Being able to modulate based on the organ pedal is a great thrill.  I find<br/>it not too hard to assimilate (though it isn&apos;t anything like second nature)<br/>for improvistion purposes, and even within the realm of the possible for<br/>adapting existing organ pieces, with slight modifications to the pedal line.<br/>But this is off the topic and I&apos;ll eventually start another thread for this.</p><p>The point here being that scores with ratio notation and/or cents notation<br/>plus fingering notation seems like a real possibility looming in my future,<br/>and something I would want to make the best of.  Using a separate staff per<br/>voice would help relieve the clutter, but of course eats pages for<br/>breakfast.  You orchestra types are used to that but us organists ain&apos;t.</p><p>Your point about using 50% gray being a problem is well-taken.  Probably<br/>putting fingering numbers in gray is a better idea.  The other issue is<br/>leaving a place for people to write in their own fingering numbers, which is<br/>probably more to the point in most cases.  Canned fingering is of limited<br/>use for many.  I don&apos;t know whether this applies for woodwind fingering.</p><p>-Kurt</p></div><h3><a id=47449 href="#47449">ðŸ”—</a>Dave Keenan &#x3C;d.keenan@bigpond.net.au&#x3E;</h3><span>9/30/2003 9:49:28 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, Carl Lumma &lt;ekin@l...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt; Ok, ok, I think we&apos;re more on the same page now.

as the &quot;root&quot; of that first chord.<br/>but according to the lattice (3^3 * 5^2), the correct<br/>72edo-HEWM notation for that note should really be E#&lt; .<br/>in JI-HEWM it would be E#-- .</p><p>of course, because blackjack is a temperament, that &quot;root&quot;<br/>could also be considered to be Gbbb++++ in JI-HEWM<br/>(this is the note at 3^-4 * 5^-4) ... i&apos;m not even going<br/>to try to figure out the 72edo-HEWM equivalent of that one.</p><p>do you begin to see how convoluted this becomes?</p><p>it&apos;s far easier to just call that note F&lt; , but doing<br/>so causes some of the harmonic &quot;meaning&quot; of the notation<br/>to be lost -- and preserving that harmonic &quot;meaning&quot;<br/>is really one of two main reasons to preserve the<br/>pythagorean/meantone basis of the notation, the other<br/>main reason being practical considerations of performance.</p><p>looking at the lattice of Graham&apos;s comma-pump, you should<br/>be able to see that blackjack can be latticed as a cylinder<br/>which wraps around at the ampersand&apos;s comma (3^7 * 5^6).</p><p>to me, all of this argues much in favor of decimal notation.</p><p>Joe, on a different but related situation, i&apos;d like it if<br/>you would take a look at the first page of my transcription<br/>of Haba&apos;s _2nd Quartet_ into my &quot;quarter-tone-staff&quot;

Could you<br/>&gt; &gt; please explain it to me?  Blackjack is a finite set of<br/>&gt; &gt; 21 pitches, yes, so why was there a problem notating the<br/>&gt; &gt; comma pump in Blackjack??  I&apos;m not getting it.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; look on the mouseover lattice applet i made on my blackjack page,<br/>&gt; and at the new 72edo-HEWM score i&apos;ve just provided.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; let&apos;s start with the very first chord, which i notated as<br/>&gt; D&gt; : F&lt; : Av : C&lt; , which in 72edo degrees is  14-28-51-70.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; you can see from the lattice that this can be analyzed as an<br/>&gt; otonal tetrad whose &quot;root&quot; is F&lt; , 72edo-degree 28.  the lattice<br/>&gt; is only 5-limit, so 72edo-degree 14 (D&gt;) in this chord looks<br/>&gt; like a 225:128 above the &quot;root&quot; but really should be representing<br/>&gt; a 7:4 above the &quot;root&quot;.  the only way i can think of to<br/>&gt; represent it in 72edo-HEWM in a &quot;meaningful&quot; way is Ebv- ,<br/>&gt; which i think is rather cumbersome.<br/>&gt;</p><p>***Hi Monz.  I see what you&apos;re getting at, but since there is no<br/>actual pitch Ebv- in Blackjack, it isn&apos;t really a consideration is<br/>it?  You&apos;ve notated it using the vocabulary you have by including the<br/>D&gt;.  Again, notation doesn&apos;t always have to perfectly reflect<br/>*theory*.  It&apos;s nice when it does, but I really don&apos;t think it&apos;s so<br/>much to get &quot;hung up&quot; about.  For me, the important thing is to<br/>notate something so that it can be *performed* but I admit, that&apos;s my<br/>*own* bias...</p><p>&gt; i.e., spelled in &quot;root position&quot; as a 4:5:6:7 tetrad, the<br/>&gt; chord should be F&lt; : Av : C&lt; : Ebv- .<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; to some extent, these problems are merely the result of<br/>&gt; trying to force blackjack to fit into the rational implications<br/>&gt; on the lattice -- it *is* a temperament, which means that<br/>&gt; there is no direct unambiguous 1-to-1 mapping to the lattice.<br/>&gt;</p><p>***That makes sense.</p><p>Would you mind, Monz, if I were to make a couple more comments on the<br/>Blackjack page??  You include the colorful lattice that Paul made<br/>with the equivalent degrees of Blackjack mapped to 12-equal.</p><p>May I suggest that there is a *better* graphic that Paul made that<br/>should be substituted for that?</p><p>He has one where he shows all the different intervals in color, but<br/>shows what the actual JUST INTERVALS are, and by how many cents<br/>Blackjack is off.  I think that&apos;s a MUCH more interesting graphic<br/>than the one comparing Blackjack to 12-equal...</p><p>Also, don&apos;t you think it might be nice to include the *most important<br/>graphic of all!* for Blackjack?

I&apos;m not getting it.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; look on the mouseover lattice applet i made on my blackjack page,<br/>&gt; and at the new 72edo-HEWM score i&apos;ve just provided.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; let&apos;s start with the very first chord, which i notated as<br/>&gt; D&gt; : F&lt; : Av : C&lt; , which in 72edo degrees is  14-28-51-70.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; you can see from the lattice that this can be analyzed as an<br/>&gt; otonal tetrad whose &quot;root&quot; is F&lt; , 72edo-degree 28.  the lattice<br/>&gt; is only 5-limit, so 72edo-degree 14 (D&gt;) in this chord looks<br/>&gt; like a 225:128 above the &quot;root&quot; but really should be representing<br/>&gt; a 7:4 above the &quot;root&quot;.  the only way i can think of to<br/>&gt; represent it in 72edo-HEWM in a &quot;meaningful&quot; way is Ebv- ,<br/>&gt; which i think is rather cumbersome.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; i.e., spelled in &quot;root position&quot; as a 4:5:6:7 tetrad, the<br/>&gt; chord should be F&lt; : Av : C&lt; : Ebv- .<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; to some extent, these problems are merely the result of<br/>&gt; trying to force blackjack to fit into the rational implications<br/>&gt; on the lattice -- it *is* a temperament, which means that<br/>&gt; there is no direct unambiguous 1-to-1 mapping to the lattice.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; ... but this is *exactly* why i think the decimal notation is<br/>&gt; so good!  it avoids the preconceived notions that one has when<br/>&gt; one uses a notation derived from Pythagorean/meantone/12edo,<br/>&gt; which is what my 72edo-HEWM, and your Sims/Maneri 72edo, are.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; ... and that was only the very first chord that i used as<br/>&gt; an example!  if you tried to figure out how to notate the<br/>&gt; entire progression in either HEWM or Sims/Maneri, you&apos;d see<br/>&gt; right away what i&apos;m talking about.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; -monz</p><p>the real problem, of course, is that the progression is a &quot;comma<br/>pump&quot; illustrating one of the commas (in this case, 2401:2400) that<br/>vanishes in the tuning -- and by definition, such a progression can&apos;t<br/>be adequately notated using ji, where would would have to either<br/>notate it &quot;drifting&quot; by 2401:2400 each time it goes around, or<br/>arbitrarily introduce a 2401:2400 shift at some point in the<br/>progression. hopefully, the problems in notating the &apos;classic&apos; I-IV-<br/>ii-V-I or I-vi-ii-V-I comma pump using ji are clear to you; this is<br/>simply another example of the type (except that here, the comma that<br/>vanishes doesn&apos;t vanish in 12-equal either!)</p></div><h3><a id=47700 href="#47700">ðŸ”—</a>Paul Erlich &#x3C;paul@stretch-music.com&#x3E;</h3><span>10/6/2003 4:45:00 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;monz&quot; &lt;monz@a...&gt; wrote:</p><p>&gt; if someone would be kind enough to write out Graham&apos;s<br/>&gt; comma-pump in the blackjack standard notation, i&apos;ll make<br/>&gt; the musical illustration graphic for the webpage.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; -monz</p><p>if you mean &quot;standard key&quot; rather than &quot;standard notation&quot;, all you<br/>have to do is transpose it down exactly 150 cents. if that isn&apos;t a<br/>mechanically simple task for you, i&apos;d be happy to do it myself. let<br/>me know.</p></div><h3><a id=47709 href="#47709">ðŸ”—</a>Kurt Bigler &#x3C;kkb@breathsense.com&#x3E;</h3><span>10/6/2003 7:17:04 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>on 10/6/03 1:18 AM, monz &lt;<a href="mailto:monz@attglobal.net">monz@attglobal.net</a>&gt; wrote:</p><p>&gt; hi Kurt (and Johnny),<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; --- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, Kurt Bigler &lt;kkb@b...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt; on 9/28/03 5:08 PM, Carl Lumma &lt;ekin@l...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt; Try reading Beethoven with 4 nominals and get back to me.<br/>&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt; Well, heck, I&apos;ll chime in here.

Could you<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; please explain it to me?  Blackjack is a finite set of<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; 21 pitches, yes, so why was there a problem notating the<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; comma pump in Blackjack??  I&apos;m not getting it.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; look on the mouseover lattice applet i made on my blackjack page,<br/>&gt; &gt; and at the new 72edo-HEWM score i&apos;ve just provided.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; let&apos;s start with the very first chord, which i notated as<br/>&gt; &gt; D&gt; : F&lt; : Av : C&lt; , which in 72edo degrees is  14-28-51-70.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; you can see from the lattice that this can be analyzed as an<br/>&gt; &gt; otonal tetrad whose &quot;root&quot; is F&lt; , 72edo-degree 28.  the lattice<br/>&gt; &gt; is only 5-limit, so 72edo-degree 14 (D&gt;) in this chord looks<br/>&gt; &gt; like a 225:128 above the &quot;root&quot; but really should be representing<br/>&gt; &gt; a 7:4 above the &quot;root&quot;.  the only way i can think of to<br/>&gt; &gt; represent it in 72edo-HEWM in a &quot;meaningful&quot; way is Ebv- ,<br/>&gt; &gt; which i think is rather cumbersome.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; i.e., spelled in &quot;root position&quot; as a 4:5:6:7 tetrad, the<br/>&gt; &gt; chord should be F&lt; : Av : C&lt; : Ebv- .<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; to some extent, these problems are merely the result of<br/>&gt; &gt; trying to force blackjack to fit into the rational implications<br/>&gt; &gt; on the lattice -- it *is* a temperament, which means that<br/>&gt; &gt; there is no direct unambiguous 1-to-1 mapping to the lattice.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; ... but this is *exactly* why i think the decimal notation is<br/>&gt; &gt; so good!  it avoids the preconceived notions that one has when<br/>&gt; &gt; one uses a notation derived from Pythagorean/meantone/12edo,<br/>&gt; &gt; which is what my 72edo-HEWM, and your Sims/Maneri 72edo, are.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; ... and that was only the very first chord that i used as<br/>&gt; &gt; an example!  if you tried to figure out how to notate the<br/>&gt; &gt; entire progression in either HEWM or Sims/Maneri, you&apos;d see<br/>&gt; &gt; right away what i&apos;m talking about.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; -monz<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; the real problem, of course, is that the progression is a &quot;comma<br/>&gt; pump&quot; illustrating one of the commas (in this case, 2401:2400) that<br/>&gt; vanishes in the tuning -- and by definition, such a progression<br/>can&apos;t<br/>&gt; be adequately notated using ji, where would would have to either<br/>&gt; notate it &quot;drifting&quot; by 2401:2400 each time it goes around, or<br/>&gt; arbitrarily introduce a 2401:2400 shift at some point in the<br/>&gt; progression. hopefully, the problems in notating the &apos;classic&apos; I-IV-<br/>&gt; ii-V-I or I-vi-ii-V-I comma pump using ji are clear to you; this is<br/>&gt; simply another example of the type (except that here, the comma<br/>that<br/>&gt; vanishes doesn&apos;t vanish in 12-equal either!)</p><p>***Monz... this kinda skipped our notice, and it was what the passage<br/>was all about!</p><p>Dumb and dumber... only I&apos;ll take claim to the latter... :)</p><p>JP</p></div><h3><a id=47730 href="#47730">ðŸ”—</a>monz &#x3C;monz@attglobal.net&#x3E;</h3><span>10/7/2003 1:06:09 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>hi Carl,</p><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, Carl Lumma &lt;ekin@l...&gt; wrote:</p><p>&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;using one ledger-line for the basic octave allows one to<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;stack staves on top of each other for other octave-registers,<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;eliminating the need for other ledger-lines.<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt; Can you give an example?<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;two illustrations of the beginning of Haba&apos;s _2nd Quartet_, here:<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;<a href="http://sonic-arts.org/dict/qt-staff.htm">http://sonic-arts.org/dict/qt-staff.htm</a><br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I&apos;m afraid I&apos;m not following you.
