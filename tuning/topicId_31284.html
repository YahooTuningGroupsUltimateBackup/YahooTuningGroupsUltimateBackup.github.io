As you say<br/>with your choices, I too made my decision to utilize<br/>Kirnberger III for the &quot;Moonlight&quot; more-or-less arbitrarily,<br/>based primarily on the ease of tuning a piano this way.</p><p>There was also something else I read recently that made<br/>me lean this way... can&apos;t find it now, but it implied that<br/>Kirnberger III would have been a typical piano tuning for<br/>Beethoven.  (I believe it was a reference to Marpurg.)</p><p>Also, I might note that he could still hear at the time he<br/>wrote the &quot;Moonlight&quot;.  His deafness was not total until at<br/>least 10 years later, if not later than that.  So I think<br/>that the sound of his piano tuning would be likely to have<br/>an influence on his compositional choices.</p><p>-monz</p><p>&gt; From: &lt;<a href="mailto:a440a@aol.com">a440a@aol.com</a>&gt;<br/>&gt; To: &lt;<a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>&gt;<br/>&gt; Sent: Monday, December 10, 2001 5:50 PM<br/>&gt; Subject: [tuning] Kirnberger III<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Monz writes:<br/>&gt; &gt; &lt;&lt; I have just in the last two weeks<br/>&gt; &gt; been studying the temperament known as &quot;Kirnberger III&quot;,<br/>&gt; &gt; because I&apos;ve been learning Beethoven&apos;s &quot;Moonlight Sonata&quot; and<br/>&gt; &gt; believe that Kirnberger III may have been a typical tuning on<br/>&gt; &gt; Beethoven&apos;s piano at the time he wrote the sonata.&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Greetings,<br/>&gt;    Yes, I agree.
