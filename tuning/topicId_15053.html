Maybe you missed it because you weren&apos;t specifically<br/>focusing on 10-tone scales.</p><p>If you look at<br/><a href="http://www.uq.net.au/~zzdkeena/Music/ErlichPentDec7Lattice.gif">http://www.uq.net.au/~zzdkeena/Music/ErlichPentDec7Lattice.gif</a>, you&apos;ll see<br/>that my pentachordal decatonic scale has one hexany in it, which (using<br/>Dave&apos;s notation) is</p><p>     Eb<br/>  ,&apos;/ \&grave;.<br/>F--/---\--C<br/>|\/     \/|<br/>|/\     /\|<br/>B\--------F#\<br/>  &grave;.\ /,&apos;<br/>    G#\</p><p>If you look a 3/2 above _or_ a 3/2 below, you&apos;ll see another hexany, only<br/>missing one note, e.g., a 3/2 above, you see:</p><p>     Bb<br/>  ,&apos;/ \&grave;.<br/>C--/---\--G<br/>| /     \ |<br/>|/       \|<br/>F#\-------C#\</p><p>The note required to complete that hexany would be D#\, while the only<br/>remaining note in the decatonic scale is an E. That&apos;s pretty close, so I&apos;m<br/>not surprised that the resulting scale is CS.</p></div>
