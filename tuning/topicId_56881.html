Well, with these performers... &quot;Go figure... &quot;  :)<br/>&gt;<br/>Good news! There&apos;s a lack of good venues in NYC. The Knitting Factory<br/>turned into a third rate rock club and Tonic is having financial problems.<br/>And a lot of the nice spaces want too much $$$.</p><p>I&apos;ve been to the Cutting Room a few times. A nice room but<br/>those Village Gate tables make me feel like I&apos;m in a jr. high school lunch room (kidding).<br/>Easy to get to by subway or train, it has a nice central location in NYC, 24th<br/>between Broadway &amp; 6th Ave.</p><p>Good to hear you had a nice turnout, I couldn&apos;t make it. When the muse<br/>visits, I have to entertain. I picked up a copy of FM7 on Friday and I&apos;ve<br/>been writing some new pieces.  Maybe next time...</p><p>--<br/>* David Beardsley<br/>* microtonal guitar<br/>* <a href="http://biink.com/db">http://biink.com/db</a></p></div>
