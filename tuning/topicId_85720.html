Recently a friend of mine who listened to my previous JI<br/>version for the first time commented about the first minor chord not<br/>sounding right to him (this was a normal 10:12:15 minor chord).<br/>I could actually not do anything else but agree with him. A 10:12:15 chord<br/>here has bothered me for allmost a year now, and I&apos;ve tried many other<br/>options, like a 16:19:24 minor, a 27:32:40 minor, and others, but couldn&apos;t<br/>make that work out when going to a 4:5:6 major after that etc couldn&apos;t make<br/>it work theoretically either.<br/>Many other things that bothered me, like a little note on measure 12.3 that<br/>sounded too low going down 16/15 etc, and the overal &quot;tragic&quot; feel of the<br/>piece went a bit lost to me, including the ending.<br/>Yet I could see no other way that gives JI consonance yet preserved melodies<br/>(no comma shifting) than my previous JI transcription.</p><p>The way I got to this new version by logic was in developing further what<br/>makes a modulation in JI.<br/>To make a long story short, I&apos;m still working on this one and expect to be<br/>working on it for quite some time.<br/>But as far as I&apos;ve gotten now, I can say Beethoven&apos;s Drei Equale No1 does<br/>NOT contain any modulations. The whole piece is in a single tonic.<br/>Now that changes things a LOT.<br/>(btw for a piece with modulations listen to my computer algorythm choir<br/>piece which randomly modulates in all directions)</p><p>Basically what I ended up with in this new JI retuning of Drei Equale is the<br/>whole piece in a single harmonic 5-limit permutation scale of 1/1 16/15 9/8<br/>6/5 5/4 4/3 45/32 3/2 8/5 5/3 9/5 15/8 2/1 where C = 1/1.<br/>The piece is more dissonant overall than 12tet this way, yet I hear it as<br/>correct. And it surely has character this way! :)</p><p>Well I was hoping for a shocking correct JI among the submissions of the<br/>retuning contest, but it seems like I have now done this myself.<br/>It sure is shocking.<br/>I do not think many of you will agree with me and think this JI version is<br/>correct, but hope some of you will.<br/>One thing is for sure, I can kiss my &euro;100.- goodbye hehe. No way this one is<br/>going to win the voting of the contest :)<br/>But I don&apos;t mind, couldn&apos;t be happyer than I&apos;m now :)</p><p>Marcel</p></div><h3>Marcel de Velde &#x3C;m.develde@...&#x3E;</h3><span>1/14/2010 10:50:31 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Funny thing.<br/>So far the 3 people I&apos;ve played this version to, all loved it and said it<br/>sounded beautifull and right amongst other things.<br/>Completely not what I expected.</p><p>I&apos;m expecting just about everybody to say they haven&apos;t heard a more out of<br/>tune piece ever.<br/>I&apos;m really curious about opinions from this list.<br/>If you&apos;ve heard it, please let me know what you think about it.<br/>I&apos;ve rendered the piece with 2 different sounds.<br/>One a dark trombone sound which is sadly the most natural trombone sound I<br/>have right now, but it doesn&apos;t have many overtones so dissonant harmonies<br/>aren&apos;t very clear.<br/>The other trombone sound is very bright with lots of overtones, which makes<br/>maximally clear dissonant harmonies (it does this even better than an<br/>unfiltered saw wave in my opinion).</p><p>Marcel<br/><a href="http://www.develde.net">www.develde.net</a></p></div><h3>Marcel de Velde &#x3C;m.develde@...&#x3E;</h3><span>1/16/2010 9:49:44 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Ok sorry false alarm.<br/>I now see the first part in the tonic of E, and have yet to re-analyse the<br/>rest of the piece, but there must be several modulations in there.<br/>First I put modulations everywhere, then I put the whole piece in one tonic,<br/>the truth is somewhere inbetween.<br/>I&apos;ll give a shout when the piece is finished (I have till March 21st :)<br/>For now I only put the beginning of the JI in E on my website.

So<br/>if you disagree that my tuning isn&apos;t 100% correct and think it can be better<br/>in any way then feel free to enter your own version :)</p><p>Marcel</p></div>
