The harmonic entropy of an interval is<br/>the number of bits needed to describe its relationship to the<br/>harmonic series after it&apos;s been munged by noisy equipment.<br/>If you try to understand it with phrases like &quot;harmonically<br/>stable&quot; -- which are more ambiguous than the thing you&apos;re<br/>trying to understand -- you&apos;ll never get anywhere.
