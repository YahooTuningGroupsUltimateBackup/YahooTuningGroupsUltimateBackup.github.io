Here is a quotation<br/>from George Secor himself as it appeared in Xenharmonicon 3,<br/>published in Spring of 1975:</p><p>[George Secor]:<br/>&quot;My motive in writing this article is to stimulate thought and<br/>dialogue on the subject of notation, with the hope that some sort of<br/>tentative standard may be agreed upon by XH contributors and<br/>readers.  In addition to the topics which I discussed above are other<br/>matters, for example, should our standard of pitch for xenharmonic<br/>systems be based on A or C, and if C, then what frequency?  In your<br/>opinion, should just intonation systems be notated on the basis of<br/>some related equal temperament, or should they have their own unified<br/>notation?  Should key transpositions be abolished from xenharmonic<br/>music?  Should the number of clefs be limited to two, three, or four?<br/>And, most important, why?  What have I neglected that you believe is<br/>important?</p><p>If I receive an adequate response to these questions in terms of<br/>numbers, I will publish the results of this informal survey in the<br/>next issue of XH.&quot;</p><p>JP</p></div>
