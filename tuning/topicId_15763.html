If anyone has experienced this tuning, I would like to hear<br/>from them.I only red the book(in french),and it<br/>sounded(!!!)interesting.&lt;&lt;</p><p>Greetings,<br/>   I don&apos;t know about the Cordier system,  but there is a traditional style<br/>of tuning that has been in favor with the Steinway factory tuners in New York<br/>that results in pure fifths.<br/>   Assume an honest to goodness 12ET on a piano that begins getting its<br/>octaves stretched upward beginning in the region of middle C (C4).  This<br/>stretching allows the fifths to lose most of their tempering within an octave<br/>and a certain sound appears, a combination of pure fifths, somewhat busy<br/>single and double octaves and a real churn to the thirds.<br/>     It is the thirds that make the sound so energetic, but the hot octaves<br/>give a lot of drive to the melodic line,( though single octaves exhibit an<br/>increasingly &quot;choral&quot; nature as one progresses up the board).  It is an edgy<br/>sound, very &quot;in your face&quot; and has been preferred by several nightclub piano<br/>people here that wanted something that could &quot;cut through&quot; a rhythm section.</p><p>   Most piano techs should be able to provide a pure fifths tuning upon<br/>request,  it is rather easy to do, just stretch till the fifths sound pure,<br/>and get used to busy thirds.<br/>Regards,<br/>Ed Foote<br/>Nashville, Tn.</p></div><h3><a id=15775 href="#15775">ðŸ”—</a>Paul H.
