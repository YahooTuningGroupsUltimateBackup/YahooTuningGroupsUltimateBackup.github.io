I assume that<br/>&gt;consonance is to be a fuzzy characteristic, so that small deviations<br/>&gt;of a fraction of a comma will only slightly reduce the truth-value of<br/>&gt;whether one of the consonant ratios mentioned above is still<br/>&gt;consonant.</p><p>yes.  i meant that in two senses:<br/>1.  a (necessarily) simple ji scale won&apos;t have to make many compromises,<br/>2.  ji is often consonant because instruments often have harmonic spectra.</p><p>also, i guess i was reacting against the 12tet world a bit!</p><p>thanks for your comments and thanks for reading about my work---<br/>i hope you enjoy it as much as i did!</p><p>---m</p><p>_________________________________________________________________<br/>Get your FREE download of MSN Explorer at <a href="http://explorer.msn.com">http://explorer.msn.com</a></p></div><h3><a id=22871 href="#22871">ðŸ”—</a>paul@stretch-music.com</h3><span>5/15/2001 11:08:06 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In tuning@y..., &quot;Michael Saunders&quot; &lt;michaelsaunders7@h...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; thank you paul, it&apos;s good to hear from you!<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;...there is another paradigm that I was surprised to see<br/>omitted ... the<br/>&gt; &gt;meantone paradigm.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; there are two reasons for that---<br/>&gt; 1. the section you&apos;re reading is concerned with the representation<br/>&gt; of intervals themselves, not with the representations of scales and<br/>&gt; tunings (that comes a bit later).</p><p>Hmm . . . so what is it about Pythagorean, 12-tET, and JI that put<br/>them in the former category?</p><p>&gt; i don&apos;t know of any systematic<br/>&gt; way to generate meantone intervals, as such, outside the context<br/>&gt; of the complete scale</p><p>Hmm . . . I may be able to help you there. As you know, I&apos;ve done a<br/>lot of meantone optimizations and such, and never had to refer to a<br/>complete scale . . . just a chain of four fifths at most. All<br/>meantone intervals are then just a certain number of meantone fifths<br/>plus a certain number of octaves (assuming that&apos;s what you mean<br/>by &quot;generate&quot;)</p><p>&gt; (but cf. with the later section of the thesis<br/>&gt; called &quot;temperaments&quot;).</p><p>I&apos;ll have to look at that and see what I can grok.</p><p>&gt; 2. the paradigms that i outlined were only intended to be examples<br/>&gt; of handy classes for generating intervals according to familiar<br/>&gt; paradigms;  i could add others later.</p><p>OK -- I think the meantone paradigm _still_ has great importance for<br/>most Western classical musicians, who continue to distinguish between<br/>augmented sixths and minor sevenths, for example.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; yes, exactly.  this is where it gets interesting.  in rusty, i<br/>represent<br/>&gt; intervals (and all other quantities) fuzzily---as functions (valued<br/>&gt; on [0,1]) of goodness (or &quot;appropriateness&quot; or &quot;suitability&quot;)<br/>&gt; vs. pitch-distance.  so, a perfect fifth, say, might be represented<br/>&gt; by a fairly broad curve peaking at 3/2.  in the later sections,<br/>you&apos;ll<br/>&gt; see how one can define a tuning as a network of fuzzy intervals<br/>&gt; and let my labrynthine optimization algorithm make all those<br/>&gt; compromises in ratio automatically, according to the slack offered<br/>&gt; by  the breadth of the curves---if you get my meaning---doing what<br/>&gt; the old tuners used to do by ear and trial-and-error.</p><p>I&apos;ve done many similar optimizations. For example, I&apos;ve found that if<br/>you start with a 7-tone-equal-temperament scale, and roll down the 42-<br/>dimensional dissonance surface, you&apos;ll end up with a diatonic scale<br/>in a quasi-meantone temperament (with the central fifths tempered the<br/>most and the outer fifths tempered the least).</p></div>
