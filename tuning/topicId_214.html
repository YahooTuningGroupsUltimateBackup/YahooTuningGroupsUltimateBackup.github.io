That&apos;s why the AFMM has<br/>&gt;never used the DX7 in its performance, but rather a Proteus synthesizer.<br/>&gt;This resolves that problem.</p><p>I take your word for it (getting rid of the beats). There are other,<br/>equally disconcerting problems, like choice of patches. One man&apos;s<br/>&quot;beautiful electronic tone&quot; is another man&apos;s &quot;Jesus Christ, turn that<br/>f***ing thing off!&quot; Which is also why some people like Starker&apos;s tone,<br/>others like Ma&apos;s, others Rostropovich: it all gets into the ear of the<br/>beholder. At least when I hear Partch performed on Partch&apos;s instruments (in<br/>spite of what &quot;grunt and squeal&quot; might emanate), at least I can judge the<br/>music on authentic terms: how it was intended, not someone else&apos;s idea of<br/>what&apos;s right.</p><p>This doesn&apos;t mean that I like every performance that is *on* the Partch<br/>instruments, or that I haven&apos;t heard attractive versions on, say, someone<br/>else&apos;s Adapted Guitar. But if you want to play music written for a<br/>Chromelodeon, get one, or make one. They exist (reed organs), and there are<br/>sites on the web devoted to them. Just don&apos;t pass off weak imitations of<br/>them and say &quot;Ta Da!&quot;</p><p>I&apos;ve been working with one film composer recently who has more samplers<br/>(Roland S-760&apos;s, I think) lined up in this one rack than I know of; I can&apos;t<br/>imagine how many gigabytes of RAM he has devoted to orchestral samples, and<br/>even with this he does multi-track digital to overlap, blend, etc. to come<br/>closer to a real orchestral fabric. And he says &quot;But you know, I can&apos;t wait<br/>to get to the studio with the orchestra to hear what it will really sound<br/>like!&quot;</p><p>So don&apos;t give me a puny little Proteus. I know the Proteus. You&apos;ve got to<br/>do better, especially in the aesthetics area, unless all you are concerned<br/>with is &apos;notes&apos;. If so, transcribe some Ben Johnston string quartets for<br/>four Proteii.</p><p>[The preceding was a joke brought to you by Sequential Circuits, Inc.]</p><p>&gt;I&apos;ve mentioned earlier about how<br/>&gt;the chromelodeon lacked the dexterity to play fast notes (like in Y.D.<br/>&gt;Fantasy) and might benefit from the technical freedoms that the<br/>&gt;synthesizers allow.</p><p>There is a conversation with Harry that, when extricated from the bowels of<br/>my voluminous archives (as if), will tend to show that he wouldn&apos;t have<br/>give a rats ass over technicality. But I could be wrong. In the meantime, I<br/>could send Francis Thumm back there to give you a lesson on how Harry<br/>thought the keyboard parts should be played on the Chromelodeon (and you<br/>get a tiny glimpse of this in &quot;The Dreamer That Remains&quot;). Articulation and<br/>clarity were not on top of the list; you might want to be more familiar<br/>with the differences between Apollo and Dionysus.</p><p>&gt;and yet the Partch choir resonates with support for the opera standard.</p><p>This defies belief. Who, pray tell, are the Partch choir, and where do they<br/>lend support for the opera standard? (And are they a registered<br/>Not-For-Profit entity?)</p><p>&gt;Fact: I don&apos;t care for Bach on piano, much preferring various other<br/>keyboards.</p><p>Meaning you prefer the keyboards Bach&apos;s music was written for? Or what<br/>other reason?</p><p>&gt;Fact: it is not the same case for Bach as for Partch in terms of why the<br/>&gt;concerts are performed in the first place.</p><p>That&apos;s not a fact, it&apos;s an opinion, and not clearly stated. What do you<br/>view as the reasons for performing Bach in concert, and for Partch? How are<br/>they different, and how alike?</p><p>&gt;Fact: Partch must be seen in historical context, like any composer.</p><p>So you want Bach on non-piano (historically contextual?) but Partch on<br/>synths (historically non-contextual?). Like any composer? Gee, I&apos;ve said it<br/>a lot before: he may not be better, but he&apos;s certainly not like *any*<br/>composer! It is a hell of a lot easier to swallow a transcription of a work<br/>originally written with little regard to the instrumental/vocal fabric than<br/>it is to sit through the &apos;mutilation&apos; of a piece with a carefully worked<br/>out &apos;orchestration&apos; (if you will). I don&apos;t know whether to laugh or cry<br/>when Kronos does Machaut and Perotin, as if *words* weren&apos;t important. Yeesh.</p><p>&gt;Fact: it has only recently been unearthed by Bob Gilmore<br/>&gt;that in 1950 Partch wrote that the chromelodeon was<br/>&gt;unmusical for him and he succeeeded in acquiring funds to research and<br/>&gt;hopefully build an acceptable electronic tone instrument.</p><p>Fact: this is extremely weak scholarship, Johnny. First, the<br/>correspondences between Partch and Lauriston Marshall have been in a few<br/>places for a while, and many months went by *before* Bob&apos;s book was out<br/>when you could read them, in context and chronological order, in<br/>Blackburn&apos;s &quot;Enclosure 3&quot;. While it is convenient to tell the story the way<br/>you&apos;d like to support your thesis, I&apos;d think that a full recounting of the<br/>years 1949-51 on the coast in Gualala would lead you to a much broader<br/>picture of how Harry viewed the instrument(s), including his physical<br/>exhaustion and the extraordinary climatic demands on the instruments in<br/>this very remote location.</p><p>I took a trip there, and stood in the smithy where he recorded the<br/>&quot;Intrusions&quot;, struggled to keep the Chromelodeon in tune in spite of the<br/>coastal fog and cold, etc., etc. A long view of that part of his life, his<br/>life and work in general, and you wouldn&apos;t be proposing the sterility of a<br/>Proteus. Unless you think it&apos;s just about notes.</p><p>&gt;Fact: he was too early in history to succeed in using an electronic<br/>instrument<br/>&gt;for his purposes.</p><p>So someone else should call up Dionne Warwick on the Psychic Hotline, ask<br/>him which rack-mount synth he&apos;d like the most *these* days, and go out and<br/>pass it off as &quot;Partch Re-Plugged&quot;.</p><p>&gt;Fact, Partch amplified his guitars and his Kithara.</p><p>So did we, when we performed with the ensemble. And this justifies...what?<br/>.<br/> .<br/>  .<br/>   .<br/>    .<br/>     I&apos;ll get more done on this subject later, but for those of you that<br/>care, you might want to read the relevant areas in both the Gilmore and<br/>Blackburn texts and judge for yourself.</p><p>It&apos;s official: I now have a headache.</p><p>Cheers,<br/>Jon<br/>~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<br/>Jonathan M.

As a Greek Revivalist he was beyond being a composer. HE<br/>PRODUCED THEATER WORKS and on this level the substitution of his<br/>instruments don&apos;t cut it on any level. Partch could easily have done<br/>arrangements if he was interested in such things. He knew what the<br/>results would be, and he decided against such things until his death.<br/>The bottom line is such things has turned off more people than not. It<br/>is not work to be performed by &quot;musicians&quot;! There must be better thing<br/>to be done at the present!</p><p>-- Kraig Grady<br/>North American Embassy of Anaphoria Island<br/><a href="http://www.anaphoria.com">www.anaphoria.com</a></p></div>
