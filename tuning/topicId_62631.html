Virsyn&apos;s<br/>products aren&apos;t real cheap, that is true, but I can attest to the<br/>quality, as I&apos;ve been using Tera 2 for a couple years now, and it<br/>really is a great instrument.</p><p>Anyhow, looking forward to the day you completely replace your guide<br/>tracks. Hope it happens before I happen to be walking in Highgate!</p><p>Cheers,<br/>Jon</p></div>
