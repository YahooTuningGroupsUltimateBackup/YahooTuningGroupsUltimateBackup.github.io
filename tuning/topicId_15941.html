Finnamore&quot; &lt;<a href="mailto:daeron@bellsouth.net">daeron@bellsouth.net</a>&gt;<br/>&gt; Subject: Fujara<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Here&apos;s an interesting microtonal folk instrument.  From the<br/>&gt; mountains of Eastern Europe, the fujara (pronounced fu-yah&apos;-rah, I<br/>&gt; assume), seems to be a type of overtone flute about six feet long,<br/>&gt; with three tone holes.  See and hear:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; <a href="http://bluyovo.misto.cz/_MAIL_/">http://bluyovo.misto.cz/_MAIL_/</a><br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Be patient, the server is slow.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; The traditional style, judging by the seven Real Audio examples on<br/>&gt; this page, is for the player/singer to alternate solo flute and<br/>&gt; vocal.  Since the flute is overblown to several harmonics, its<br/>&gt; intonation is clearly microtonal.  But the vocals don&apos;t sound like<br/>&gt; they&apos;re in the same tuning.  They sound simply diatonic.  This is<br/>&gt; especially remarkable considering that the musician sings the same<br/>&gt; melody he just played on the flute.</p><p>I&apos;ll have to go check this URL out later when the phone line isn&apos;t being<br/>used as a phone. One of my favorite folk flutes right now is a Swedish made<br/>overtone flute that I&apos;m learning to play. It&apos;s side blown, there are no<br/>holes, between overblowing, and opening and closing the end, you end up with<br/>a full octave (plus a few notes lower) of the lydian dominant overtone<br/>scale. Of course, all the tones played on this flute are just intervals.<br/>Some modern instruments have one hole added, which can give the player a<br/>couple of extra notes. This instrument is used alot in Nordic music styles,<br/>there is a petty substantial repertoire of traditional tunes written on<br/>these instruments.</p><p>A similar instrument, but end blown, is used in eastern European music such<br/>as Hungarian, Rumanian, etc. I&apos;ve watched a player half open or close the<br/>end for some interesting extra tones, most notably, the flatted second of<br/>the altered phrygian mode used for so much klezmer and gypsy music. I need<br/>to make one of these flutes too.</p><p>On a recent recording of the group Muzsikas playing their interpretation of<br/>Bartok, and some of the original collected folksongs that he was inspired<br/>by, there&apos;s a tune played on one of these flutes. The player is<br/>simultaneously singing/humming almost buzzinbg/growling into it as he plays.<br/>Like the recording you mentioned, not always singing the exact same pitch as<br/>the flute. The effect is transformative.</p><p>Now that I think of it, there&apos;s also a similar overtone flute played on a<br/>Huun-Huur-Tu CD of Tuvan instrumental and vocal music.</p><p>Seth</p><p>--<br/>Seth Austen<br/>please visit me on the web at <a href="http://www.sethausten.com">http://www.sethausten.com</a><br/>email; <a href="mailto:seth@sethausten.com">seth@sethausten.com</a></p><p>Download a song (mp3) at <a href="http://www.mp3.com/sethausten">www.mp3.com/sethausten</a></p></div><h3><a id=15964 href="#15964">ðŸ”—</a>David Finnamore &#x3C;daeron@bellsouth.net&#x3E;</h3><span>11/28/2000 12:18:01 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@egroups.com">tuning@egroups.com</a>, Seth Austen &lt;acoustic@l...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt; One of my favorite folk flutes right now is a Swedish made<br/>&gt; overtone flute that I&apos;m learning to play.</p><p>Does it have a common name, or is it simply called &quot;Swedish overtone<br/>flute&quot;?
