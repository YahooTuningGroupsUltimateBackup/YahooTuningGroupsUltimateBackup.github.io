It would be nice to have an<br/>&apos;octave&apos; plus some rather than 25 tones to the &apos;octave&apos;. Thus I&apos;m looking at the 15 - 22 ish notes<br/>per &apos;octave&apos;. The bowed psaltery has room for only 17 strings. I had thought of the principle of a<br/>useful 17 tone subset of the &apos;master&apos; scale or simply the best group of 17 consecutive tones. The<br/>mbira, for bass lines mainly, has room for up to 25 tones. The zither, or more probably 3 zithers,<br/>will have 6 tones each maximum, giving 18 tones, though I&apos;m not sure as to how wide I can spread<br/>the range as they will be fairly similar and using guitar strings. The tubes are fixed, the others<br/>tunable,  so I&apos;ll be looking at a very flexible and resourceful scale for the tubes as I&apos;ll be<br/>using them for the current voice project and for pure instrumental projects.</p><p>I first intend setting various texts for voice and instruments. The vocal parts will have a<br/>microtonal element as regards melody, though not so obscure as demanding too much of good<br/>professional singers. There will also be harmonic part writing. The instruments will underpin and<br/>embellish the choir and provide interludes which will modify some of the vocal melodies  with more<br/>of a microtonal twist. In a sense the instruments and choir are antiphonal at points with the<br/>instruments bending some of the sung melodies and harmonies. Such is the general plan.</p><p>But as I said I&apos;d like the master instrument scale, which will be fixed for the tubes, to have<br/>both good harmonic and melodic resources. The jury is still out on the relevance of the<br/>inharmonicity of the tubes, and indeed the mbira, so I&apos;m not too concerned about spectral matching<br/>and the like.</p><p>&apos;Blackjack&apos; to my ears, and from studying the correspondence, has exceptional harmonic resources,<br/>but I&apos;d have to spend more time to ponder the melodic possibilities. The Eikosanies again seem to<br/>have interesting harmonic possibilities and strange melodic features.</p><p>I rather like the idea of having several tetrachordal possibilities in the one scale, since I&apos;ve<br/>worked a lot with modal modulation in  past pieces. Finding a solution that provides good harmonic<br/>potential would be one satisfactory solution. My heart is for JI, my head often leans towards<br/>Equal Temperament so I&apos;ve no party card.</p><p>Naturally I don&apos;t anticipate a solution but  suggestions would be welcome. After all, you got<br/>Joseph &quot;sorted&quot; and look where that all led!

Secor&apos;s paper at<br/>&lt;<a href="http://www.anaphoria.com/secor.PDF">http://www.anaphoria.com/secor.PDF</a>&gt; or XH3 doesn&apos;t claim it to be the<br/>best system for anything, or mention 11-limit harmony.  It does say the<br/>system works well with Partch&apos;s scale (note he didn&apos;t know about the<br/>earlier 43 note scale that really does approximate to 45 Miracle notes).<br/>My work can hardly be considered independent from Dave&apos;s.  The<br/>quantitative results were tweaked to ensure Miracle did well in the 7 and<br/>11 limits anyway.</p><p>The 24 note Miracle (Blackjack+3) keyboard mapping has firmly established<br/>itself as my favourite extended mapping.  I can testify to its melodic<br/>resources, and will keep working at music demonstrating this.  I&apos;m not<br/>sure why you&apos;d need to go beyond the 31 notes.  It may be better to<br/>squeeze in more octaves beyond that point.  But yes, there&apos;s no need to<br/>stop with an MOS.  If you don&apos;t have as many as 21 notes, tune to your<br/>favourite 11-limit JI scale.</p><p>&gt;From &lt;<a href="http://www.microtonal.co.uk/decimal_lattice.htm">http://www.microtonal.co.uk/decimal_lattice.htm</a>&gt;, it looks like the<br/>d&apos;Alessandro scale almost fits the 41 note MOS.  I think it has something<br/>to do with Eikosanies.  So you could tune to a Miracle-tempered Eikosany,<br/>and I think you&apos;d get some extra consonances.</p><p>45 or more notes for the singers does look complex.  The problem isn&apos;t so<br/>much the inherent complexity of Miracle temperament, but the inability of<br/>traditional notation to express it with fewer than 72 notes.

All these can be found as subsets<br/>of the 1 3 5 7 9 11 Eikosany, so this is also introducing<br/>one gradually to the Eikosany subsets.</p><p>Then I&apos;d perhaps want to make a dekany next. If the instruments<br/>were ones that one could mount in a light framework, maybe<br/>one could actually mount the ten notes in the Octahedron + tetrahedron<br/>arrangement in the projection Paul used in his dekany<br/>animations (and I use on my dekany web page).</p><p>Excuse me if this has already been said. I could easily have<br/>missed a post. However seemed the discussion has been<br/>focussed on 72-tet scales rather than the Eikosany itself<br/>as such. I think with Eikosany as based on the idea of<br/>really pure triads etc, would be nice if one could do them<br/>pure, and perhaps this would help hone ones perception of<br/>pure intervals.</p><p>I wonder a little if retuning _everything_ to an approximation<br/>to j.i. might in the end run somewhat dull ones perception<br/>of j.i.?? Or at least, not stretch it in the direction<br/>of hearing j.i. intervals more and more finely.</p><p>72-tet is also just one of many n-tets. E.g. I&apos;ve recently<br/>been exploring 55-tet, which is fascinating. If building<br/>instruments, one is hard-coding to a particular n-tet<br/>- okay if it is easy to make them or retune them,<br/>but quite a commitment to that n-tet if it is a matter<br/>of, say, many weeks or months of work...</p><p>Also, like Dan, I wonder if consistency though interesting as a<br/>concept, might possibly be overrated as regards musicality.</p><p>Does it matter how the intervals add up??  At least, I&apos;d<br/>want to see from actual musical examples and compositions<br/>why it is important to have consistency; rather than just formulae.<br/>Or, see what effect it has compositionally, and decide for myself<br/>if I like that kind of an effect.</p><p>Irregularity is interesting and composers often are doing things<br/>to throw rhythms etc. out from perfect symmetry, so<br/>maybe &quot;inconsistent&quot; scales could be desirable too?<br/>Perhaps dep. on the composer and the style of the piece.</p><p>A few thoughts anyway. Not trying to dissuade you at all<br/>if you are keen on building 72-tet subsets; especially<br/>if this is because you like the sound of 72-tet.</p><p>Robert</p></div><h3><a id=29208 href="#29208">ðŸ”—</a>John A. deLaubenfels &#x3C;jdl@adaptune.com&#x3E;</h3><span>10/16/2001 9:00:05 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>[Alison wrote:]<br/>&gt;&gt;Yes, I&apos;ve decided to tune the current metallophone to Blackjack and<br/>&gt;&gt;my only problem is which frequency to start with.

Hexanies are quite easy to learn when mapped to a standard<br/>&gt; keyboard. After all, there are &quot;only&quot; 8 different chords in a hexany.<br/>&gt; So for them six keys or blocks side by side and octave-repeating is<br/>&gt; just as good a design as this star-shaped instrument. But it would be<br/>&gt; nice if there were some such intuitive design for the eikosany.</p><p>Maybe a skyscraper type design? Or concentric stars maybe for the<br/>octaves?...</p><p>It&apos;s fairly easy to find the hexany chords on keyboard, but a little<br/>unintuitive improvising on hexany in keyboard layout. You can&apos;t so easily see the<br/>geometry; the way the chords relate to each other. I feel that a six pointed star<br/>would be more intuitive. Or indeed, a 3D octahedron.</p><p>You could prob. get nice symmetrical arrangements for the eikosany.<br/>I think symmetry would make it easier to learn where the chords<br/>are as one has only a few patterns to learn.</p><p>Ditto for the dekany. There I think the 3D shape would be really great if it was<br/>possible in terms of ergonomics to play the notes. (You just need the ten vertices<br/>and the framework to hold them).</p><p>I&apos;d like to make one some day, actually...</p><p>I&apos;m not really set up for making instruments at present though, in terms of space,<br/>equipment etc, (and so much I want to do in way of software), so it&apos;s something<br/>for further into the future.</p><p>Robert</p></div><h3><a id=29248 href="#29248">ðŸ”—</a>Alison Monteith &#x3C;alison.monteith3@which.net&#x3E;</h3><span>10/17/2001 9:03:56 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Paul Erlich wrote:</p><p>&gt; --- In tuning@y..., Alison Monteith &lt;alison.monteith3@w...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; Yes, I&apos;ve decided to tune the current metallophone to Blackjack and<br/>&gt; my only problem is which<br/>&gt; &gt; frequency to start with.

Have you read the back issues of<br/>Xenharmonicon? There are some incredibly detailed articles on layouts for instruments, mainly by<br/>Erv Wilson. I&apos;m sure you&apos;d get the details on the anaphoria website.</p><p>&gt; One could make the 1 3 5 7, 1 3 5 11, 1 3 5 9, 1 3 7 11<br/>&gt; or even 1 5 7 11 hexanies. All these can be found as subsets<br/>&gt; of the 1 3 5 7 9 11 Eikosany, so this is also introducing<br/>&gt; one gradually to the Eikosany subsets.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Then I&apos;d perhaps want to make a dekany next. If the instruments<br/>&gt; were ones that one could mount in a light framework, maybe<br/>&gt; one could actually mount the ten notes in the Octahedron + tetrahedron<br/>&gt; arrangement in the projection Paul used in his dekany<br/>&gt; animations (and I use on my dekany web page).<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Excuse me if this has already been said. I could easily have<br/>&gt; missed a post. However seemed the discussion has been<br/>&gt; focussed on 72-tet scales rather than the Eikosany itself<br/>&gt; as such. I think with Eikosany as based on the idea of<br/>&gt; really pure triads etc, would be nice if one could do them<br/>&gt; pure, and perhaps this would help hone ones perception of<br/>&gt; pure intervals.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I wonder a little if retuning _everything_ to an approximation<br/>&gt; to j.i. might in the end run somewhat dull ones perception<br/>&gt; of j.i.?? Or at least, not stretch it in the direction<br/>&gt; of hearing j.i. intervals more and more finely.</p><p>I&apos;m still not sure about this. I&apos;m coming round to the opinion, through listening and comparing,<br/>that 2 - 3 cents of Just is pretty much Just, given the inharmonicity of strings in particular. I<br/>intend to try a small group of instruments, including metal tubes, tuned to &apos;Blackjack&apos;. As with<br/>22 tet I like to work with one tuning for a reasonable length of time. Then I&apos;ll make a set of<br/>Eikosany tubes and work with that. After all that I might be qualified to comment on the effects<br/>of tempering.</p><p>&gt; 72-tet is also just one of many n-tets. E.g. I&apos;ve recently<br/>&gt; been exploring 55-tet, which is fascinating. If building<br/>&gt; instruments, one is hard-coding to a particular n-tet<br/>&gt; - okay if it is easy to make them or retune them,<br/>&gt; but quite a commitment to that n-tet if it is a matter<br/>&gt; of, say, many weeks or months of work...<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Also, like Dan, I wonder if consistency though interesting as a<br/>&gt; concept, might possibly be overrated as regards musicality.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Does it matter how the intervals add up??  At least, I&apos;d<br/>&gt; want to see from actual musical examples and compositions<br/>&gt; why it is important to have consistency; rather than just formulae.<br/>&gt; Or, see what effect it has compositionally, and decide for myself<br/>&gt; if I like that kind of an effect.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Irregularity is interesting and composers often are doing things<br/>&gt; to throw rhythms etc. out from perfect symmetry, so<br/>&gt; maybe &quot;inconsistent&quot; scales could be desirable too?<br/>&gt; Perhaps dep. on the composer and the style of the piece.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; A few thoughts anyway. Not trying to dissuade you at all<br/>&gt; if you are keen on building 72-tet subsets; especially<br/>&gt; if this is because you like the sound of 72-tet.</p><p>Well, I suppose the sound comes first and I have to say that I liked Joseph&apos;s piece and I have a<br/>batch of ideas from tinkering with &apos;Blackjack&apos; on my synth. It all depends on whether I can get<br/>the sounds into my head and start thinking and creating with that scale. Same old problem.</p><p>Regards</p><p>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;</p></div><h3><a id=29255 href="#29255">ðŸ”—</a>Paul Erlich &#x3C;paul@stretch-music.com&#x3E;</h3><span>10/17/2001 12:00:01 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In tuning@y..., &quot;John A. deLaubenfels&quot; &lt;jdl@a...&gt; wrote:</p><p>&gt; So, no purple extends from C (which is transposed to A).<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; It&apos;ll come as no surprise to you that my [mind, heart, some part]<br/>rebels<br/>&gt; against any lattice that is missing so many connections.</p><p>Missing?
