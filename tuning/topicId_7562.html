I also understand how this would<br/>be a particular problem in relation to the way Schubert structures his<br/>harmonies.  However, if Paul Erlich would like to go into this question in<br/>further detail, as he suggested, I would find it very interesting...</p><p>Thanks again!</p><p>Joseph Pehrson</p></div>
