Steve had a couple of nasty concerto movements to prepare, but<br/>my colleagues were swell about helping out (not to mention a stellar<br/>stage crew...).</p><p>&gt; a couple of questions in one of the photo of the extended PVC<br/>tubing it looks almost like it is corrugated.</p><p>Yeah, Home Depot has a new kind of tube that is a combination of sort-<br/>of corrogated black tubing with a white plastic outer cover. Don&apos;t<br/>know much about it, but it was light-weight and easy to cut<br/>(therefore, to tune).</p><p>&gt; You play them with ping pong pallets?</p><p>This one small percussion maker makes a few odd sticks, and one kind<br/>is a &apos;paddle&apos; of round foam (dense and soft) discs at the end, which<br/>completely cover the open end of a tube with a slap. For other uses,<br/>one of the easiest whackers is a pair of flip-flops, believe it or<br/>not!</p><p>&gt; And the oak bars have not arch cut out of them, did you cut them i<br/>some systematic way or did you &quot;eyeball&quot; them (having all those years<br/>consummating your relationship with wooden bars)</p><p>Bear in mind that one of the purposes was to show how easy it is to<br/>use found or near-found materials; when scouting the store I found<br/>some of the red oak cut-offs, and even short lengths had a nice,<br/>bright klang. Not to mention that the development of<br/>the &apos;instruments&apos; took place over only a matter of days - I imagine I<br/>can finesse stuff with time (especially adding resonators, which<br/>won&apos;t be too tough).</p><p>Also, marimba bars, which not only emphasize the octave harmonic but<br/>strive for longer ring times, utilize a deep arch, whereas xylophone<br/>bars (thicker, very little arch) emphasize the next harmonic (a<br/>fifth) and this is more in line of what I was shooting for (for all<br/>the above reasons).</p><p>&gt; BTW I am a big fan of Spring and the biggest spring factory in the<br/>world, century spring in downtown here.</p><p>I *must* go there sometime! I am trying to clear the schedule to make<br/>the shadow play on the 18th (still iffy) and if I can maybe I&apos;ll make<br/>a dual-purpose trip...</p><p>&gt; It was pictured in CONNOISSEUR MAGAZINE.
