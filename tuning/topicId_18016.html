Once, I had the opportunity to visit AT&amp;T&apos;s Westchester complex<br/>which housed a pair of oscilloscopes that were built to track radar for<br/>submarines during the Viet Nam war.  A composer at The Juilliard named Potter<br/>coordinated with a scientist there to make musique concrete scores.  These<br/>were exhibited in a &quot;performance&quot; of recorded music and a gallery of print<br/>outs of the oscilloscope scores.  Inside, it moved as you watched it, at a<br/>steady pace.</p><p>The other oscilloscope analyzed pitch ingredients.  There was this naive<br/>notion that one could look at the pitch frequencies produced by flutist<br/>Julius Baker, or bassoonist Johnny Reinhard, and have an audio blueprint for<br/>matching the unique tone of a teacher to a student.  This was not taken too<br/>seriously.</p><p>Most interesting, and to the point, I found that with fingered multiphonics<br/>(distinguishing from overblown or underblown notes) there are 2 sets of<br/>longitudal vibrations running through the same instrument.  When frequencies<br/>locked up more (sort of like DNA comparisons) there was a sense of<br/>consonance.  The inverse was greater grit.</p><p>Johnny Reinhard<br/>AFMM, bassoonist</p></div>
