Suffice it to say, the tensile strength<br/>of<br/>&gt;   spring steel music wire varies with diameter.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;   &gt;His equation (3) too is identical to his equation (1); recall<br/>that<br/>&gt;   &gt;I have previously explained that the mass per unit length is<br/>&gt;   &gt;nothing else but D^2 x pi x rho.<br/>&gt;   &gt;Anyway, I am glad he finally agrees with you about the fact<br/>that<br/>&gt;   &gt;equation (3) (the one you had furnished sometime ago), is not<br/>an<br/>&gt;   &gt;approximate relationship, but is as rigorous as his first<br/>equation;<br/>&gt;   &gt;they are in fact, as I keep on saying, identical<br/>relationships...<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;   In Ozan&apos;s original text, and I quote,<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;   ******************************<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;   The middle strings are manufactured from stainless steel such<br/>&gt;   that each weigh about 20 grams per unit meter, or 8 grams (0.008<br/>&gt;   kgs) per 0.4 meters.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;   ******************************<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;   the diameter of the sample string is not included.<br/>&gt;   Hence, no one is able to verify the accuracy of this physical<br/>&gt;   property of the wire.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;   &gt;His last equation too is correct, but, although he defined it,<br/>I<br/>&gt;   &gt;would have used another symbol for the total mass so as not<br/>&gt;   &gt;to confuse it with &grave;mass per unit length&grave;. Nevertheless, after<br/>&gt;   &gt;writing eqation (3),  his equation (4) is again a triviality,<br/>and<br/>&gt;   &gt;for this reason, redundant.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;   Again, I believe it is better to be thorough than to be terse.<br/>&gt;   Also, Equations 3 and 4 are highly interesting to me because<br/>they<br/>&gt;   would enable a prospective instrument builder to contemplate<br/>&gt;   these kinds of calculations without owning an expensive<br/>&gt;   micrometer.  An accurate postage scale could be used to measure<br/>&gt;   either the mass per unit length (M/u.l.) or the total mass (M)<br/>of a<br/>&gt;   string.  Personally, I find this kind of approach, especially in<br/>a<br/>&gt;   classroom where for financial reasons a precision micrometer may<br/>&gt;   not exist, highly interesting and most relevant.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;   &gt;On the whole, I am glad to see that he has tacitly agreed with<br/>&gt;   you in the end...<br/>&gt;   &gt;My best wishes to him...<br/>&gt;   &gt;<br/>&gt;   &gt;Pap T.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;   Dear Distinguished Professor at MIT,<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;   My best wishes to you as well.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;   Cris Forster, Music Director<br/>&gt;   <a href="http://www.Chrysalis-Foundation.org">www.Chrysalis-Foundation.org</a></p></div>
