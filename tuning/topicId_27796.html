Here is Bolzano, JI-style:</p><p>1 - 126/121 - 1715/1584 - 33/28 - 27/22 - 14/11 - 4/3 - 168/121 -<br/>121/84 - 3/2 - 11/7 - 44/27 - 56/33 - 1715/968 - 3168/1715 - 121/63</p><p>Sizes of intervals vary from 63 cents to 80.5 cents, and representing<br/>it via the 72-et couldn&apos;t hurt. Of course, if you are not looking for<br/>a somewhat screwed-up scale there are lots of other choices. On the<br/>other hand if you really like unusual 11-limit relationships here are<br/>some.</p><p>Lest Bolzano hears about this let me candidly state that you can&apos;t<br/>really pin the blame on him.</p></div>
