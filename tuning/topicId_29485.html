Since I know that you like 72-tET, a<br/>24-out-of-72-tET subset occurs to me here.</p><p>While 24-out-of-36-tET with two 12-tET keyboard at 1/6-tone apart is<br/>great for neo-Gothic styles with near-just 12:14:18:21 and 14:17:21<br/>sonorities, let&apos;s look at a different kind of subset with features<br/>suggesting both &quot;neo-medieval&quot; and &quot;neo-Renaissance&quot; elements.</p><p>Suppose we take two 12-tET keyboards at 1/12-tone apart, getting<br/>something like this:</p><p>    117     217          617      817     1017<br/>    C#&apos;3    Eb&apos;3         F#&apos;3     G#&apos;3    Bb&apos;3<br/>C&apos;3     D&apos;3    E&apos;3   F&apos;3      G&apos;3      A&apos;3     B&apos;3   C&apos;4<br/>17      217    417   517      717      917     1117  1217<br/>---------------------------------------------------------<br/>    100     200          600      800     1000<br/>    C#3     Eb3          F#3      G#3      Bb3<br/>C3      D3      E3   F3       G3       A3       B3   C4<br/>0       200    400   500      700      900     1100  1200</p><p>Here I&apos;ve used an apostrophe (&apos;), resembling Vicentino&apos;s &quot;comma&quot; sign,<br/>to show the smallest interval in 72-tET at 16-2/3 cents. Of course,<br/>people are free to substitute the symbols they consider most<br/>appropriate, and my choice here is intended mainly to prevent a<br/>conflict with other symbols in a neo-Gothic style of notation:</p><p>Let&apos;s consider first some neo-Gothic possibilities maybe not so often<br/>discussed in dialogues on 72-tET, but well worthy of recognition.</p><p>If we play a major third like D3-F#&apos;3, we get an interval of 416.67<br/>cents, very close to 11:14 (~417.51 cents); likewise F#&apos;3-A3 gives us<br/>a minor third of 283.33 cents, close to 28:33 (~284.45 cents). Playing<br/>a major sixth like D3-B&apos;3, we get about 916.67 cents, close to 10:17<br/>(~918.64 cents) or to the familiar tempered interval of 13/17 octave in<br/>17-tET (~917.65 cents).</p><p>Something like</p><p>  B&apos;3   C4<br/>  A3    G3<br/>  F#&apos;3  G3<br/>  D3    C3</p><p>has an &quot;exaggerated Pythagorean&quot; kind of quality with compact 83-cent<br/>semitones, and might be especially affable in a gentle timbre where<br/>the thirds and sixths have a &quot;relatively blending&quot; effect.</p><p>Something like</p><p>  G#&apos;4  A4<br/>  E4    D4<br/>  C#&apos;4  D4</p><p>could be charming in lots of timbres, since the minor third often<br/>tends to keep a relatively concordant quality across a wide spectrum<br/>of intonations. This isn&apos;t necessarily to say that minor thirds around<br/>283 cents (about 11 cents narrower than Pythagorean) were likely heard<br/>in the 14th-century, although the variability of ensemble intonation<br/>doesn&apos;t make it seem too improbable, only that we have a nice a 72-tET<br/>resource for related styles.</p><p>For Renaissance or later tertian styles, we have those 5-limit<br/>sonorities of 0-383-700 cents, e.g. C&apos;3-E3-G&apos;3. Here the main<br/>complication is fingering for octave voicings on two conventional<br/>keyboards, the same problem one runs into with Vicentino&apos;s adaptive JI<br/>system in real-time performance in playing just fifths combining notes<br/>from the two manuals of his 36-note instrument.</p><p>Also, for a 7-limit style, we get approximations of 4:5:6:7 at<br/>0-383-700-983 cents (optimizing the 4:5), or 0-400-700-983 (optimizing<br/>the 5:7). With a full 72-tET, one could do 0-383-700-967, consistently<br/>optimizing all the intervals.</p><p>This may be an example of how a _subset_ of an n-tET, or of an open<br/>tuning for that matter, might be &quot;inconsistent&quot; although a large set<br/>would permit a more consistent optimization for a given sonority or<br/>set of ratios.</p><p>I guess that a &quot;Classic-like&quot; resolution of 0-400-700-983 cents to a<br/>near-just 0-383-700 cents might look like this:</p><p>             B&apos;4  C&apos;5<br/>&#x9;     F4   E4<br/>             D&apos;3  G&apos;3<br/>             G&apos;3  C&apos;3</p><p>Here the upper pair of voices contract from a near-5:7 at 583.33 cents<br/>to a near-4:5 at 383.33 cents, using 100-cent semitones as efficient<br/>as in 12-tET.</p><p>It&apos;s not consistent in this subset, but I suspect that some people<br/>might consider it preferable to 12-tET, and if so, we have an example<br/>of how &quot;inconsistency&quot; doesn&apos;t exclude practical musical advantages<br/>for even a relatively small tuning set like this one.</p><p>Joe, thank you for all your contributions here, and also for sharing<br/>with us your experiences as a musician and a resident of New York in<br/>these tragic weeks.</p><p>Your activities as a global ambassador of xenharmonic diversity may<br/>represent and promote our yearnings for world peace.</p><p>Most appreciatively,</p><p>Margo Schulter<br/><a href="mailto:mschulter@value.net">mschulter@value.net</a></p></div><h3><a id=29492 href="#29492">ðŸ”—</a>jpehrson@rcn.com</h3><span>10/24/2001 7:03:14 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In tuning@y..., mschulter &lt;MSCHULTER@V...&gt; wrote:</p><p><a href="/tuning/topicId_29485.html#29485">/tuning/topicId_29485.html#29485</a></p><p>Hello Margo!</p><p>Thank you so very much for your post which, I believe, could be the<br/>first article in history that projects Medieval and Renaissance<br/>styles onto a subset of 72-tET!</p><p>When I first read your post I must confess that I had to view some of<br/>my previous comments with a bit of humor.

Thus, by<br/>adding a second meantone chain 1/4-comma higher than the first, one<br/>has access to perfectly just major triads (root and third from lower<br/>chain, fifth from higher chain) and minor triads (root from lower<br/>chain, third and fifth from higher chain) at every position in which<br/>you have a tempered triad in both of the meantone chains (13 major<br/>and 13 minor triads, at least).</p><p>In 12-tET, the perfect fifth is nearly just, which the major third is<br/>sharp by about 15 cents, and the minor third is flat by about 15<br/>cents.

In the<br/>latter system it is of course 15 cents. But triadic musics that<br/>require the vanishing of, say, the diaschisma or Pythaogean comma,<br/>such as much of Schubert&apos;s music, would of course work much better in<br/>the latter system, since these intervals become a full diesis of<br/>about 40 cents in the former system.</p></div><h3><a id=29634 href="#29634">ðŸ”—</a>jpehrson@rcn.com</h3><span>10/26/2001 12:41:18 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In tuning@y..., &quot;Paul Erlich&quot; &lt;paul@s...&gt; wrote:</p><p><a href="/tuning/topicId_29485.html#29604">/tuning/topicId_29485.html#29604</a></p><p>&gt; In 1/4-comma meantone temperament, the major third is just, while<br/>the minor third and the perfect fifth are both 1/4-comma flat.
