Dropping the horizontal springs did of course reduce vertical<br/>pain, BUT melodic and grounding pain both went UP.</p><p>Note: I could have omitted horizontal springs and melodic springs<br/>altogether, but by leaving them in place with negligible strength,<br/>they become a gauge without significantly distorting the results.<br/>Melodic springs here are 1% of &quot;nominal&quot; (where I&apos;ve picked a tentative<br/>nominal value from listening experiments), and horizontal springs in<br/>the first tuning are a mere .01% of nominal.</p><p>My assessment: the first tuning is quite good, much better than I<br/>expected when Paul suggested the experiment, but there are passages<br/>where a sounding note wavers audibly.  Try around 5:30 to 6:00, for<br/>instance, where there is a mix of sustained melodic notes and rapid,<br/>harmonically varying background notes which push the long notes around<br/>in tuning to an excessive degree, IMO.  The second, more usual treatment<br/>sounds very clean and lovely to me (though I miss the 7:4 7ths of a<br/>7-limit tuning ;-&gt; ).</p><p>Well, Paul, for the Nth time (N &gt;&gt; 1), your suggestion has lead to a<br/>very interesting listening experience.  Don&apos;t look for a retiring of<br/>horizontal springs any time soon, however!</p><p>JdL</p></div><h3><a id=27473 href="#27473">ðŸ”—</a>jpehrson@rcn.com</h3><span>8/27/2001 1:14:37 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In tuning@y..., &quot;John A. deLaubenfels&quot; &lt;jdl@a...&gt; wrote:</p><p><a href="/tuning/topicId_27453.html#27453">/tuning/topicId_27453.html#27453</a></p><p>Curiously enough, the file that did *not* have horizontal springs in<br/>it seemed more &quot;justy&quot; than the other file.
