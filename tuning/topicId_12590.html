Could you possibly adjust the<br/>&gt;&gt;absolute tuning so that the scale degrees are more reasonable?</p><p>[Gene:]<br/>&gt;I uploaded 12-et, 22-et, and 7-limit versions also, and I thought you<br/>&gt;could try adapting the 12-et and seeing how they compared.</p><p>Oh, kyool!  That saves me _lots_ of work!  Just uploaded my 7-limit<br/>adaptive tuning of the 12-tET version, in the JdL directory of the files<br/>area:</p><p>   <a href="http://groups.yahoo.com/group/tuning/files/JdL/mat12cr7.mid">http://groups.yahoo.com/group/tuning/files/JdL/mat12cr7.mid</a></p><p>I hear little difference between my 7-limit adaptive tuning and your<br/>adaptive tuning; both sound very nice to my ear.

The only<br/>rationale, and it&apos;s non-musical, that I can see for it is that this<br/>ratio is the base of the natural logarithms. For the inverse<br/>function, it is the base that uniquely yields an exponential curve<br/>whose slope is equal to its absolute value at every point along the<br/>curve. It is found everywhere in nature, since it is a curve that<br/>describes a rate of growth directly proportional to the size of<br/>whatever is growing.</p><p>Such things as microbial population growth, radioactive decay, etc.<br/>often follow this curve in one direction or the other. Why that<br/>should recommend it for musical use is beyond my comprehension, but<br/>maybe someone has some kind of ready defense for it. A truly valid<br/>defense might be harder to come by. There are tons of natural<br/>phenomena that conceivably could be  misapplied to almost anything,<br/>including music.

My way of proceeding would<br/>be for instance to compose in a ten note scale of nine secors in a<br/>chain, and give oneself the freedom to transpose to any of 72 keys; I<br/>think Blackjack has too many notes to be a good scale anyway.

In my musical gamut notation, they name pitches within a<br/>chain of fifths in a Pythagorean, just, equal temperament or meantone scale.<br/>Alpha is the first fifth, beta is the second and so on.  In larger scales,<br/>the first cycle of letters is marked with a prime mark above and to the<br/>right of the letter, and the second cycle puts the prime mark below and to<br/>the left (in which case the letters are then named &quot;hyperalpha, hyperbeta,<br/>hypergamma&quot; and so on.)  Sharps and flats are no longer necessary to<br/>indicate pitches, but can be used optionally to mark relationships between<br/>notes within a tonality (the classsic 5/4 third vs. the Pythagorean 81/64<br/>third, for example).

I share every bit of the enthusiasm that<br/>Joseph (and others) have expressed in appreciation of a very<br/>effective diagram.</p><p>Of special interest to me was the color correlation with numerical<br/>ratios, which is very close to what I have been using for some of my<br/>own diagrams, including the original version of my 72-EDO octave<br/>diagram, in which colored vertical lines identify groups of ratios.<br/>(The one that I put out there is monochrome, because the file size<br/>that way is much smaller.)  There are two basic differences in our<br/>choice of colors:</p><p>1) Since I had a white background on which to put the colored lines,<br/>white was not a color choice; and</p><p>2) I used a harmonic limit higher than 11.</p><p>These were my color selections (ratio groups followed by color):</p><p>1 -- black (but if you are doing background colors for black<br/>lettering, I would go with white, just as you did!)<br/>3 -- red<br/>5 -- orange<br/>7 -- medium golden brown (i.e., having a yellow chroma, only darker<br/>for better contrast with a white background; but again, for a<br/>background color, it would be yellow!)<br/>9 -- green<br/>11 -- cyan (rendered a little darker, for better contrast with white<br/>background)<br/>13 -- powder blue (halfway between cyan and additive primary blue,<br/>just as orange is about halfway between red and yellow)<br/>15 -- primary blue (additive; having no green component, this is<br/>quite dark, almost indigo, and it looks like what you used for ratios<br/>of 11)<br/>17 &amp; 19 -- violet (halfway between additive primary blue and magenta;<br/>I lumped these two primes together, because their intervals sound<br/>very similar)<br/>&gt;19 -- magenta (you call this color purple in your spreadsheet, and I<br/>think all the heavy-beating intervals for which you used it will fall<br/>into this category)</p><p>If you changed your blue background to cyan for ratios of 11 (which<br/>would make those cells much easier to read), we would be very close<br/>to establishing a color standard for identifying categories of<br/>ratios.

Seems a contradiction.<br/>&gt;</p><p>****Well, Dave, since the &quot;B&quot; is &quot;modified&quot; by a &quot;v&quot; it has to<br/>be &quot;altered&quot; or &quot;twelfth-low.&quot;  So, yes, I prefer that G-B-D in<br/>an &quot;unaltered state&quot; be our traditionally wide 12-tET triad.</p><p>&gt;<br/>&gt; And so, you want to base your interval nomenclature on those that<br/>are  out of tune? I still don&apos;t get it. Why?</p><p>****Why?  Because that&apos;s what hoards of players in conservatories and<br/>music schools have studied and are *used* to.  And, I believe that&apos;s<br/>what they are going to study for the conceivable future.  I haven&apos;t<br/>heard of any schools, except for isolated cases at the New England<br/>Conservatory, to offer anything different.</p><p>The system that *you* would like where G-B-D *is* 4:5:6 is<br/>essentially the system advocated by Ben Johnston and we&apos;ve found<br/>quite a few inconsistencies trying to reconcile that even to the<br/>basic Pythagorean-based staff.</p><p>I find his notation quite confusing, and I would hate to try to teach<br/>it to players.  I believe the difficulty of his notation is one<br/>reason that several of his major works, the major (I mean in stature,<br/>not in pitch :) ) string quartets have yet to be performed!</p><p>Ben Johnston has a *name* as a composer and, still, no one wants to<br/>tackle these works. (I didn&apos;t say &quot;tackle&quot; because of the American<br/>Superbowl today, either...)</p><p>&gt;<br/>&gt; I&apos;d be saying to the musicians, &quot;No. Not a 12-tET major third, we<br/>&gt; don&apos;t have to put up with that crap any longer. We want a real true<br/>&gt; just proper pure major third. You know, the kind you can tune by<br/>ear.<br/>&gt; The barbershop harmony kind. _That&apos;s_ what we call a major third in<br/>&gt; _this_ scale.&quot;</p><p>***Like I say, that&apos;s what Ben Johnston tries to do and he *does* get<br/>performances.  However he mostly *doesn&apos;t* get performances.</p><p>What I&apos;m saying is very obvious and simple:  just, for the notational<br/>convenience, keep the 12-tET pitches *as is* since they are what<br/>everybody has practiced and studied, and everything else is<br/>a &quot;deviation...&quot;</p><p>I can *guarantee* this will produce the fastest results in<br/>traditional players and until we see an entirely different group of<br/>players out there, this is the best way to go, in *my* opinion.</p><p>Music is, mostly, for better or worse, *not* about rational thinking,<br/>but about *practicing.*  &quot;Practicing&quot; means that one &quot;gets used&quot; to<br/>certain conventions, patterns, standards.</p><p>&quot;Practicing&quot; is not *logical.*  It&apos;s really not about *logic* at all<br/>(particularly the way *most* players practice  :) )</p><p>Once a certain standard is defined and practiced, it&apos;s a bit silly to<br/>go &quot;against the grain&quot; and use a different standard, even though it<br/>might make more &quot;logical&quot; sense.</p><p>But, I don&apos;t want to stop anybody.  Go ahead with the Ben Johnston<br/>route, but I don&apos;t want to hear any complaining about how, if you&apos;re<br/>a composer, you&apos;re not getting performances!   :)</p><p>JP</p></div><h3><a id=33611 href="#33611">ðŸ”—</a>jpehrson2 &#x3C;jpehrson@rcn.com&#x3E;</h3><span>2/3/2002 6:58:23 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In tuning@y..., &quot;dkeenanuqnetau&quot; &lt;d.keenan@u...&gt; wrote:</p><p><a href="/tuning/topicId_12590.html#33603">/tuning/topicId_12590.html#33603</a></p><p>&gt; --- In tuning@y..., &quot;paulerlich&quot; &lt;paul@s...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt; &gt; --- In tuning@y..., &quot;dkeenanuqnetau&quot; &lt;d.keenan@u...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; If the 12-tET-based interval naming works better for you, then<br/>&gt; &gt; so be<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; it, but I can&apos;t help feeling that it completely ignores the<br/>&gt; JI-basis<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; that is the raison detre for Blackjack.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; but your system, based on a 5-limit interpretation of diatonic<br/>&gt; &gt; intervals, is only well-suited for systems where 81:80 is<br/>&gt; &gt; tempered out. otherwise it develops ugly &apos;kinks&apos; much like ben<br/>&gt; &gt; johnston&apos;s pitch notation.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Surely this only happens if you try to _apply_ it as a pitch<br/>notation.<br/>&gt; Please give some exaples of &quot;ugly kinks&quot;.<br/>&gt;</p><p>****Hi Dave!</p><p>Our &quot;BenJohnstonFest&quot; on this list started Mid-April of last year<br/>after the Claremont Microfest where I saw Kyle Gann and David Doty<br/>present compositions in the Ben Johnston notation which does, indeed,<br/>proclaim the &quot;major triad&quot; as the &quot;just&quot; one... but it starts on &quot;C!&quot;<br/>and &quot;middle C&quot; is the &quot;middle C&quot; of the piano  :)</p><p>As usual, months of this started with one of my idiotic questions,<br/>which you will find here:</p><p><a href="/tuning/topicId_20929.html#20929">/tuning/topicId_20929.html#20929</a></p><p>Joseph</p></div><h3><a id=33612 href="#33612">ðŸ”—</a>jpehrson2 &#x3C;jpehrson@rcn.com&#x3E;</h3><span>2/3/2002 7:10:04 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In tuning@y..., &quot;dkeenanuqnetau&quot; &lt;d.keenan@u...&gt; wrote:</p><p><a href="/tuning/topicId_12590.html#33603">/tuning/topicId_12590.html#33603</a></p><p>&gt; Surely this only happens if you try to _apply_ it as a pitch<br/>notation.<br/>&gt; Please give some exaples of &quot;ugly kinks&quot;.<br/>&gt;</p><p>****Actually, Dave, the Ben Johnston discussion, started in April,<br/>took a break for almost a month, and then started again with Monz,<br/>mid-May of last year:</p><p><a href="/tuning/topicId_20929.html#21054">/tuning/topicId_20929.html#21054</a></p><p>Joseph</p></div><h3><a id=33613 href="#33613">ðŸ”—</a>jpehrson2 &#x3C;jpehrson@rcn.com&#x3E;</h3><span>2/3/2002 7:19:30 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In tuning@y..., &quot;paulerlich&quot; &lt;paul@s...&gt; wrote:</p><p><a href="/tuning/topicId_12590.html#33605">/tuning/topicId_12590.html#33605</a></p><p>&gt; --- In tuning@y..., &quot;jpehrson2&quot; &lt;jpehrson@r...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; ****Thanks so much, Paul, for this beautiful chart.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; I think you are fulfilling the dreams of people like Busoni and<br/>&gt; &gt; Varese....<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; JP<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; There is one ratio missing from the chart.

These are the simplest ratios.</p><p>Whether the mediant of these ratios, 14:11 (~417.51 cents), also<br/>involves an audible coupling of partials or &quot;dyadic harmonic entropy<br/>minimum&quot; seems much more debatable.</p><p>However, I would say that a major third at 14:11 or any other exact<br/>integer ratio can be called &quot;just&quot; in a more generic usage: for<br/>example, &quot;a just 12544:9801&quot; (~427.20 cents).</p><p>What sounds &quot;in tune&quot; or &quot;out of tune&quot; may have lots to do with the<br/>relevant tuning system and musical style. Thus a major third around<br/>423-424 cents, a proposed &quot;harmonic entropy maximum,&quot; can sound<br/>&quot;in tune and relatively concordant&quot; in some neo-medieval settings, but<br/>quite &quot;out of tune&quot; in a Renaissance setting where something at or<br/>near 5:4 is expected.</p><p>To me, xenharmonics means a willingness and readiness to explore any<br/>corner of the intonational universe, and to look at a given style as<br/>its own musical language, rather than an imperfect translation of some<br/>other &quot;standard&quot; such as 12-EDO, or 5-limit just intonation for that<br/>matter. One person&apos;s or style&apos;s &quot;in tune&quot; interval may be another<br/>person&apos;s or style&apos;s &quot;30-cent error.&quot;</p><p>Of course, a &quot;user-friendly&quot; outlook should include a willingness to<br/>translate terms so as to promote understanding -- but also with an<br/>awareness that describing one system in terms of the conventions of<br/>another can distort as well as commnicate musical reality.</p><p>Thus in a Renaissance meantone setting, or related &quot;Xeno-Renaissance&quot;<br/>style, I find it very natural to take a &quot;major third&quot; as synonymous<br/>with 5:4 or something close. An interval such as 32:25 (~427.37 cents)<br/>might be called either a &quot;diminished fourth,&quot; which I&apos;d tend to use if<br/>it behaves in a typical Renaissance fashion; or a &quot;supermajor third,&quot;<br/>especially if it occurs boldly and gets treated in more of a<br/>neo-medieval fashion, often expanding to a fifth.</p><p>In a neo-medieval setting, I might often simply call it a &quot;major<br/>third,&quot; while 5:4 or thereabouts could be a &quot;diminished fourth&quot; or<br/>&quot;schisma third.&quot;</p><p>Each system or style has its own sense of &quot;normalcy,&quot; and letting the<br/>language reflect this context feels right to me.</p><p>This doesn&apos;t rule out providing helpful cues to someone who may be<br/>attuned to a specific system, for example:</p><p>           &quot;For a listener accustomed to 12-EDO, a major third<br/>            has a standard size of 400 cents -- but other systems<br/>            have their own standards. In Renaissance or related<br/>            styles, a major third is typically at around 5:4 or<br/>            386 cents, about 1/12-tone lower. In neo-medieval<br/>            styles, it is often at around 14:11 or 418 cents,<br/>            about 1/12-tone higher.</p><p>            While a newcomer to these styles may regard these<br/>            sizes of thirds as &apos;deviations&apos; from 12-EDO, they<br/>            represent regular and routine intervals, just as<br/>            the 400-cent third does in a 12-EDO setting. Thus<br/>            it is important to get &apos;acclimated&apos; to each tuning<br/>            system or musical &apos;language&apos; in its own terms.&quot;</p><p>To Dave Keenan: Thank you for so ably and eloquently presenting your<br/>view of JI as &quot;audible purity,&quot; certainly one viable definition, and<br/>worth keeping in very prominent view.</p><p>Most appreciatively,</p><p>Margo Schulter<br/><a href="mailto:mschulter@value.net">mschulter@value.net</a></p></div><h3><a id=33629 href="#33629">ðŸ”—</a>paulerlich &#x3C;paul@stretch-music.com&#x3E;</h3><span>2/3/2002 4:11:22 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In tuning@y..., &quot;jpehrson2&quot; &lt;jpehrson@r...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt; --- In tuning@y..., &quot;dkeenanuqnetau&quot; &lt;d.keenan@u...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; <a href="/tuning/topicId_12590.html#33602">/tuning/topicId_12590.html#33602</a><br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; Er _which_ one are you calling the major triad here.

I believe Paul Erlich has<br/>&gt; pointed to studies that show that even *string* players, since<br/>the<br/>&gt; advent of many works with strings and piano, particularly, tend<br/>to<br/>&gt; play in 12-tET, even though one might think they would play in<br/>just<br/>&gt; or Pythagorean.</p><p>since 1800 european conservatories have taught musicians to<br/>play sharps at least as high as enh. equivalent flats, never lower.<br/>is it surprising that this has worked its way into our cultural<br/>consciousness? the just major third has a different emotional<br/>character than the equal tempered one, as does the major third<br/>a twelfth tone lower than the just one. plenty of cultures have<br/>found ways to make artistic use of these intervals. ours is<br/>perhaps &quot;bright&quot;-feeling in comparison -- and our minor third,<br/>flatter than just, is exaggerated in its difference from the major<br/>third. unlike mark, i don&apos;t see an overwhelming gravitation toward<br/>&quot;brightness&quot; in just about any musical culture i can think of. in<br/>java the octaves are often &quot;brightened&quot; or &quot;darkened&quot; but the<br/>average &quot;major third&quot; is about 369 cents.</p><p>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; Should we refer to the 1/4 comma meantone major third (4:5)<br/>as a<br/>&gt; &gt; twelfth-low major third too?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; ****I guess yes, if you were describing in in 72-tET.

There are, however, three more:<br/>&gt; 26, 29 and 33. Anybody has experiences with these?</p><p>26 is a nice one, especially if you go beyond the diatonic scale to explore its other resources. It&apos;s consistent up to the 13 limit, which is better than anything until you get to 29, and you have to go all the way up to 41 before you run across one that does better in terms of consistency than 29. The diatonic semitones are very large (3 steps, or about 138.5 cents), and the chromatic semitones are very small (1 step), so I like to use the intermediate-sized 92.3-cent semitone in some melodic contexts instead of always using the pure diatonic scale. You can hear this interval in the melody of my 26-ET etude from 1998:</p><p><a href="http://www.io.com/~hmiller/midi/26tet.mid">http://www.io.com/~hmiller/midi/26tet.mid</a></p><p>More recently, I&apos;ve been using the &quot;lemba&quot; MOS (or technically DE, since it has a half-octave period), which in its most basic form has a 10-note scale of 6 large steps and 4 small steps to the octave (6x3 + 4x2). I put &quot;lemba&quot; in quotes since that&apos;s really the name of the temperament, but I don&apos;t have a specific name for the scale.

I am glad you like this piece. I was inspired to write this piece after I read that Harry Partch, in 1933, had finished his cello adaptation and was engaged in writing just-intonation music for three adapted string instruments for Monophony (see more at <a href="http://sonic-arts.org/mclaren/partch/evolution.htm">http://sonic-arts.org/mclaren/partch/evolution.htm</a>). This piece is supposed to reflect on the possibilities of a Partchian string family adaptation, but is by no means a reconstruction of Partch&apos;s unfinished string trio (for which no traces remain). And, yes, this is my first composition (microtonal and otherwise). I composed this piece about four years back, in the summer of 2005. Before composing this I had sketched several incomplete ideas (mostly in 12-tone equal temperament), which I consider academic exercises rather than serious presentable compositions, and I never completed them. But the String Trio was my first foray into the world of serious composition, and I have written about a dozen microtonal compositions since then.</p><p>As for string instruments, I play the cello and the hammered dulcimer, which I tune to various microtonal scales (mostly extended seven-limit just intonation). When I compose for other instruments, I use electronic simulations. For this piece, I used NoteWorthy Composer and SCALA to create the MIDI file.</p><p>Praveen Venkataramana</p><p>P.S. When composing this piece I did not think of the 33-tone scale I used as a Permutation Product Set, but rather as Tonality Diamond 1 3 5 7 9 15 21 35, which fits the Partchian theme.</p><p>Also, another piece I have composed around the same time as the String Trio is available at <a href="http://www.praveen.us/eofh.mp3">http://www.praveen.us/eofh.mp3</a>. It is a symphonic prelude called &quot;Explosion of Harmonics&quot; and is written in the same scale as the String Trio, plus an additional 56/45 ratio.</p><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;Carl Lumma&quot; &lt;carl@...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Hi Praveen,<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Can you tell us anything more about this piece?

Before composing this I had sketched several incomplete<br/>&gt; ideas (mostly in 12-tone equal temperament), which I consider<br/>&gt; academic exercises rather than serious presentable compositions,<br/>&gt; and I never completed them. But the String Trio was my first<br/>&gt; foray into the world of serious composition, and I have written<br/>&gt; about a dozen microtonal compositions since then.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; As for string instruments, I play the cello and the hammered<br/>&gt; dulcimer, which I tune to various microtonal scales (mostly<br/>&gt; extended seven-limit just intonation). When I compose for other<br/>&gt; instruments, I use electronic simulations. For this piece, I<br/>&gt; used NoteWorthy Composer and SCALA to create the MIDI file.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Also, another piece I have composed around the same time as<br/>&gt; the String Trio is available at <a href="http://www.praveen.us/eofh.mp3">http://www.praveen.us/eofh.mp3</a>.<br/>&gt; It is a symphonic prelude called &quot;Explosion of Harmonics&quot; and<br/>&gt; is written in the same scale as the String Trio, plus an<br/>&gt; additional 56/45 ratio.</p><p>Hi Praveen,</p><p>Sorry for the late response.  I initially looked at this post<br/>at work but didn&apos;t open my work computer this weekend until<br/>just now.</p><p>Thanks for the details.  I like _Explosion_ also, and would<br/>welcome a similar rendering of _Trio_, and anything else you<br/>are ready to share.

And it keeps the integrity of the<br/>melodies.<br/>The reason it is an ending chord has more to do with how it&apos;s used than the<br/>chord itself in the this case. It&apos;s built up to be the ending chord by the<br/>preceding chords and rhythm, and made more strongly by repeating it 3 times.<br/>No I don&apos;t think Beethoven ment to write a 1/1 40/27 2/1 5/2 ending chord,<br/>but still the whole piece leads to the ending chord beeing a very sad and<br/>emotionally loaded chord.

I think this is wrong too, and it sounds wrong to me. It<br/>makes the melodies shift / drift / out of tune and makes every chord<br/>consonant losing in my opinion colour etc.</p><p>3) JI with comma shifts. I used to think this is the solution but no longer<br/>think so.<br/>   It&apos;s often impossible to not make melodies shift aswell making them sound<br/>out of tune, problems with held notes etc.</p><p>4) Letting the pitch of the whole piece drift up or down. Sounds wrong and<br/>doesn&apos;t allways work when there is one long held note during the comma pump<br/>situation etc.</p><p>5) Make everything very high prime limits and convince yourself that it is<br/>correct, like 19/13 or 83/67 etc in normal chords and melodies / music.</p><p>6) JI without comma shifts. Making chords &quot;out of tune&quot;, or so it seems at<br/>first but I&apos;ve shown you can &quot;re-interpret / correctly interpret&quot; chords to<br/>more dissonant yet perfectly valid JI chords which have thesame underlying<br/>notes in 12tet. I beleive now that this is the correct way to do it now, and<br/>I&apos;ve developed a working theory for how to analyse which chords have a more<br/>complex structure and what their structure is.<br/>This is also the only way which keeps melodies 100% pure JI without crazy<br/>stepsizes or any shifts whatsoever.</p><p>Take your pick.<br/>You have to pick from the above list as to my knowledge their is no other<br/>way to do it than the ways described above. (if you know of another way / I<br/>left one out please tell)<br/>And with all ways other than adaptive JI you have to accept certain chords<br/>in a form that is not the most consonant JI form of that chord.<br/>For melodies the choice is clear offcourse.</p><p>Marcel</p></div><h3><a id=82670 href="#82670">ðŸ”—</a>rick_ballan &#x3C;rick_ballan@...&#x3E;</h3><span>4/7/2009 11:08:52 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, Marcel de Velde &lt;m.develde@...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; I couldn&apos;t find yesterday&apos;s Beethoven file again today to compare.

That way it would be impossible to make a<br/>&gt; bad chord.  True, any one chord would likely be 80-85% as consonant as a<br/>&gt; pure due to needed error lost to one pure interval to make, say, a far less<br/>&gt; pure one next to it sound decent...but it would likely eliminate much of the<br/>&gt; need for music theory to help guard against sour combinations (as it does in<br/>&gt; 12TET).<br/>&gt;</p><p>Hmm I feel like writing a very long story about my thoughts on this<br/>approach. It has parts I like in certain situation but also many parts I<br/>don&apos;t like.<br/>But don&apos;t have the time now to write this long a story, so I&apos;ll say my 2<br/>most important objection.<br/>It seems to me that with this approach there are only a few possible scales<br/>(with many dissonant chords) that will allow melodies to stay pure.<br/>Only 12 tone scales built out of only 25/24 16/15 and 27/25 stepsizes for<br/>ALL their stepsizes confirm to this.<br/>This however clashes with your theory as I don&apos;t think hitting all 12 tones<br/>of the above scales will produce the most consonant chords.<br/>Secondly, when making a 12 tone scale that is consonant as 1 chord you will<br/>no doubt lose all the beautifull character and colours that music is capable<br/>of. Just like 12tet, but in different ways.<br/>I can&apos;t beleive in a theory that either makes melodies go off, or that<br/>doesn&apos;t allow the full colours that music is capable of.</p><p>   Crap, assuming you did this using blind tests (IE where the listeners<br/>&gt; where not told in either way tell which was which) then you are on the same<br/>&gt; side of fence as I am: half the list hates your work, but you have at least<br/>&gt; a small following of people who do.<br/>&gt;</p><p>Yeah a little bit of crap indeed, but also not as I personally know these<br/>people and they have been brutally honest with me before about things<br/>sounding bad and they know they can do this.<br/>But yeah not as good as a blind test indeed.</p><p>&gt;   I&apos;ve also experienced the situation where 95% of the time listeners think<br/>&gt; my scales are inferior to 12TET and, when I come up with something a good<br/>&gt; 70% or more of the time they think is better is when I post it.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;    One thing is for sure: good theory or not people on here seem VERY<br/>&gt; irritated by almost any scale created by members that doesn&apos;t have 4 PHDs<br/>&gt; and 5 thesis-type papers to back it up.

As I said, your tonal chords sound very good in whole numbers, but symmetrical chords are an entirely different matter. Firstly, both in theory and in practice, it seems to me that the whole point of a dim 5th interval is that we can&apos;t tell which note is the tonic. This translates theoretically in the fact that 1:sqrt2 = sqrt2:2 (i.e. quite literally 2/sqrt2 = sqrt2) so we can&apos;t tell which is the tonic. The same principle of course holds for the dim chord 1:2^(1/3),:2^(1/2),:2^(2/3),:2.</p><p>Secondly, Beethoven did write in 12 edo tuning so that we can rightly assume that he chose this chord in this place for a reason. As you know, lowering each note of a dim chord by a semitone produces a dom 7 chord, each one min 3rds apart. Beethoven, like Bach, is renown for &apos;punning&apos; on the fact that relative maj and min are minor 3rds apart so that for eg replacing G7 with G#dim leads to Amin instead of C maj. So I think that getting a good dim chord in a Beethoven tuning would be an important priority.</p><p>With the risk of sounding like a shopping list, &apos;thirdly&apos;, my very first post on this list was asking you guys whether the min 3rd as 6/5 could not be substituted by 19/16, simply because the 5 in the denominator did not produce the tonic (and minor keys are just as common as major)i.e. in contrast 2/1, 3/2 and 5/4 all have 2^N in the denominator. I also noticed that this interval didn&apos;t produce good b5 or may 6 either. eg the b5 should be (6/5)^2 = 36/25, which isn&apos;t that good a flat fifth. And as I have also been saying lately that, due to the limits of hearing, the irrationals might be rational numbers after all, your interval 45/32 is much closer to sqrt2. Would it be outside of 5-limit to use 19/16 45/32 and 32/19 or something? Or even 19/16 (19/16)^2 = 1.41015625 and (19/16)^3 = 1.67456055, or are these numbers too large for 5-limit? Another possibility would be taking 45/32 from 19/16 which would be 1.66992188 for the maj 6.</p><p>Many Regards</p><p>Rick</p></div><h3><a id=82689 href="#82689">ðŸ”—</a>Marcel de Velde &#x3C;m.develde@...&#x3E;</h3><span>4/9/2009 10:19:00 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Hi Rick,</p><p>Excuse my ignorance but I&apos;m not sure what the convention of using + between<br/>&gt; intervals means in &lt;1/1 + 10/9 + 3/2 + 9/8 + 5/4 + 6/5&gt;.<br/>&gt;</p><p>It&apos;s not any ignorance on your part.

So I think that getting a good<br/>&gt; dim chord in a Beethoven tuning would be an important priority.<br/>&gt;</p><p>The best diminished 7th chords are 7-limit I think.<br/>I was so hoping not to have to go that way because of the math involved but<br/>I&apos;ve been thinking some more about the optimal tuning without comma shifts<br/>for &quot;extended diatonic / chromatic&quot; 12-tone music lately and 7-limit does<br/>make sense and should give more consonant solution.</p><p>For great 7-limit dimished 7th chords try these 4:</p><p>7/6   4/3   2/1   9/8   45/32 27/16<br/>1/1 + 8/7 + 3/2 + 9/8 + 5/4 + 6/5<br/>giving:<br/> 1/1  : 7/6     45/32  27/16   2/1<br/> 7/6  : 135/112 81/56  12/7    2/1<br/> 45/32: 6/5     64/45  224/135 2/1<br/> 27/16: 32/27   112/81 5/3     2/1</p><p>7/6   4/3   2/1   9/8   45/32 105/64<br/>1/1 + 8/7 + 3/2 + 9/8 + 5/4 + 7/6<br/>giving:<br/> 1/1   : 7/6     45/32 105/64  2/1<br/> 7/6   : 135/112 45/32 12/7    2/1<br/> 45/32 : 7/6     64/45 224/135 2/1<br/> 105/64: 128/105 64/45 12/7    2/1</p><p>32/27 4/3   2/1   8/7   10/7  12/7<br/>1/1 + 9/8 + 3/2 + 8/7 + 5/4 + 6/5<br/>giving:<br/> 1/1  : 32/27   10/7   12/7    2/1<br/> 32/27: 135/112 81/56  27/16   2/1<br/> 10/7 : 6/5     7/5    224/135 2/1<br/> 12/7 : 7/6     112/81 5/3     2/1</p><p>32/27 4/3   2/1   8/7   10/7  5/3<br/>1/1 + 9/8 + 3/2 + 8/7 + 5/4 + 7/6<br/>giving:<br/> 1/1  : 32/27   10/7  5/3     2/1<br/> 32/27: 135/112 45/32 27/16   2/1<br/> 10/7 : 7/6     7/5   224/135 2/1<br/> 5/3  : 6/5     64/45 12/7    2/1</p><p>With the risk of sounding like a shopping list, &apos;thirdly&apos;, my very first<br/>&gt; post on this list was asking you guys whether the min 3rd as 6/5 could not<br/>&gt; be substituted by 19/16, simply because the 5 in the denominator did not<br/>&gt; produce the tonic (and minor keys are just as common as major)i.e. in<br/>&gt; contrast 2/1, 3/2 and 5/4 all have 2^N in the denominator. I also noticed<br/>&gt; that this interval didn&apos;t produce good b5 or may 6 either. eg the b5 should<br/>&gt; be (6/5)^2 = 36/25, which isn&apos;t that good a flat fifth. And as I have also<br/>&gt; been saying lately that, due to the limits of hearing, the irrationals might<br/>&gt; be rational numbers after all, your interval 45/32 is much closer to sqrt2.<br/>&gt; Would it be outside of 5-limit to use 19/16 45/32 and 32/19 or something? Or<br/>&gt; even 19/16 (19/16)^2 = 1.41015625 and (19/16)^3 = 1.67456055, or are these<br/>&gt; numbers too large for 5-limit? Another possibility would be taking 45/32<br/>&gt; from 19/16 which would be 1.66992188 for the maj 6.<br/>&gt;</p><p>I was thinking like this a long time ago when I was looking at scales as<br/>beeing constructed from harmonic segments.<br/>like the major scale beeing 15:16:18:20 the on the 20 the sequence starts<br/>again 15:16:18:20<br/>When thinking like this the minor chord relative to the major chord would<br/>indeed be 19/16<br/>15:16:17:18:19:20 + 15:16:17:18:19:20<br/>giving the scale (starting on 16) 1/1 17/16 9/8 19/16 5/4 4/3 17/12 3/2<br/>19/12 5/3 15/8 2/1<br/>The empty space between 5/3 and 15/8 you could fill up by both going from 20<br/>to 21 and down from 15 to 14 giving both thesame frequency of 7/4<br/>so 1/1 17/16 9/8 19/16 5/4 4/3 17/12 3/2 19/12 5/3 7/4 15/8 2/1<br/>2 harmonic segments a fifth apart interconnecting.<br/>This way of thinking does give me the nicest way of using the 7th harmonic<br/>melodically. It always seems to sound right when walking down to the 7th<br/>from 2/1 -&gt; 15/8 -&gt; 7/4<br/>But the 19/16 in minor chords, I don&apos;t like the sound of it. And in actual<br/>use it sounded pretty much like tempering to me with the extra disadvantage<br/>of still requiring comma shifts (even more than normal 5 or 7-limit JI).<br/>And in the end prefer my theory of harmony on how to contruct harmony, It<br/>makes deeper sense to me.<br/>But still looking at melody as segments of the harmonic series still makes<br/>sense to me. I personally don&apos;t know how to look at <a href="http://it.My">it.My</a> ear also fails me<br/>a lot when experimenting with the harmonic series.And i though lower prime<br/>limits would allow me to make things perfect and know that what i&apos;m doing is<br/>right because of pure harmonies.<br/>But now with this drei equali piece i seem to prefer dissonant chords in<br/>places where there could be a very consonant chord.<br/>So maybe it&apos;s back to the drawing board.<br/>Or maybe i can make it make perfect sense in 7 limit without comma shifts<br/>and my theory prevails.<br/>I guess what I&apos;m sayiing is, I don&apos;t know.

My hypothesis is that the &apos;irrational&apos; numbers are not irrational at all, that instead of sqrt2 = 1.41421356...where the digits after the decimal point go onto infinity, the actual interval on the piano might be 45/32 = 1.40625 (close to one decimal place) or 181/128 = 1.4140625 (close to three places).

Perhaps there is some other law at play here, but we certainly don&apos;t yet know it.

Firstly, both in theory<br/>&gt; &gt; and in practice, it seems to me that the whole point of a dim 5th interval<br/>&gt; &gt; is that we can&apos;t tell which note is the tonic. This translates theoretically<br/>&gt; &gt; in the fact that 1:sqrt2 = sqrt2:2 (i.e. quite literally 2/sqrt2 = sqrt2) so<br/>&gt; &gt; we can&apos;t tell which is the tonic. The same principle of course holds for the<br/>&gt; &gt; dim chord 1:2^(1/3),:2^(1/2),:2^(2/3),:2.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Well I think there can be many theories about how the dimished 7th chord is<br/>&gt; contructed.<br/>&gt; My personal choice is to see all harmony in just intonation intervals, and<br/>&gt; in particular according to my theory of harmony.<br/>&gt; The fact that the just intonation versions (there are many of them) are not<br/>&gt; symetrical doe not make them incompatible with how they have been thought of<br/>&gt; / used in the past I think.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; Secondly, Beethoven did write in 12 edo tuning so that we can rightly<br/>&gt; &gt; assume that he chose this chord in this place for a reason. As you know,<br/>&gt; &gt; lowering each note of a dim chord by a semitone produces a dom 7 chord, each<br/>&gt; &gt; one min 3rds apart. Beethoven, like Bach, is renown for &apos;punning&apos; on the<br/>&gt; &gt; fact that relative maj and min are minor 3rds apart so that for eg replacing<br/>&gt; &gt; G7 with G#dim leads to Amin instead of C maj. So I think that getting a good<br/>&gt; &gt; dim chord in a Beethoven tuning would be an important priority.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; The best diminished 7th chords are 7-limit I think.<br/>&gt; I was so hoping not to have to go that way because of the math involved but<br/>&gt; I&apos;ve been thinking some more about the optimal tuning without comma shifts<br/>&gt; for &quot;extended diatonic / chromatic&quot; 12-tone music lately and 7-limit does<br/>&gt; make sense and should give more consonant solution.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; For great 7-limit dimished 7th chords try these 4:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; 7/6   4/3   2/1   9/8   45/32 27/16<br/>&gt; 1/1 + 8/7 + 3/2 + 9/8 + 5/4 + 6/5<br/>&gt; giving:<br/>&gt;  1/1  : 7/6     45/32  27/16   2/1<br/>&gt;  7/6  : 135/112 81/56  12/7    2/1<br/>&gt;  45/32: 6/5     64/45  224/135 2/1<br/>&gt;  27/16: 32/27   112/81 5/3     2/1<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; 7/6   4/3   2/1   9/8   45/32 105/64<br/>&gt; 1/1 + 8/7 + 3/2 + 9/8 + 5/4 + 7/6<br/>&gt; giving:<br/>&gt;  1/1   : 7/6     45/32 105/64  2/1<br/>&gt;  7/6   : 135/112 45/32 12/7    2/1<br/>&gt;  45/32 : 7/6     64/45 224/135 2/1<br/>&gt;  105/64: 128/105 64/45 12/7    2/1<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; 32/27 4/3   2/1   8/7   10/7  12/7<br/>&gt; 1/1 + 9/8 + 3/2 + 8/7 + 5/4 + 6/5<br/>&gt; giving:<br/>&gt;  1/1  : 32/27   10/7   12/7    2/1<br/>&gt;  32/27: 135/112 81/56  27/16   2/1<br/>&gt;  10/7 : 6/5     7/5    224/135 2/1<br/>&gt;  12/7 : 7/6     112/81 5/3     2/1<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; 32/27 4/3   2/1   8/7   10/7  5/3<br/>&gt; 1/1 + 9/8 + 3/2 + 8/7 + 5/4 + 7/6<br/>&gt; giving:<br/>&gt;  1/1  : 32/27   10/7  5/3     2/1<br/>&gt;  32/27: 135/112 45/32 27/16   2/1<br/>&gt;  10/7 : 7/6     7/5   224/135 2/1<br/>&gt;  5/3  : 6/5     64/45 12/7    2/1<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; With the risk of sounding like a shopping list, &apos;thirdly&apos;, my very first<br/>&gt; &gt; post on this list was asking you guys whether the min 3rd as 6/5 could not<br/>&gt; &gt; be substituted by 19/16, simply because the 5 in the denominator did not<br/>&gt; &gt; produce the tonic (and minor keys are just as common as major)i.e. in<br/>&gt; &gt; contrast 2/1, 3/2 and 5/4 all have 2^N in the denominator. I also noticed<br/>&gt; &gt; that this interval didn&apos;t produce good b5 or may 6 either. eg the b5 should<br/>&gt; &gt; be (6/5)^2 = 36/25, which isn&apos;t that good a flat fifth. And as I have also<br/>&gt; &gt; been saying lately that, due to the limits of hearing, the irrationals might<br/>&gt; &gt; be rational numbers after all, your interval 45/32 is much closer to sqrt2.<br/>&gt; &gt; Would it be outside of 5-limit to use 19/16 45/32 and 32/19 or something? Or<br/>&gt; &gt; even 19/16 (19/16)^2 = 1.41015625 and (19/16)^3 = 1.67456055, or are these<br/>&gt; &gt; numbers too large for 5-limit? Another possibility would be taking 45/32<br/>&gt; &gt; from 19/16 which would be 1.66992188 for the maj 6.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I was thinking like this a long time ago when I was looking at scales as<br/>&gt; beeing constructed from harmonic segments.<br/>&gt; like the major scale beeing 15:16:18:20 the on the 20 the sequence starts<br/>&gt; again 15:16:18:20<br/>&gt; When thinking like this the minor chord relative to the major chord would<br/>&gt; indeed be 19/16<br/>&gt; 15:16:17:18:19:20 + 15:16:17:18:19:20<br/>&gt; giving the scale (starting on 16) 1/1 17/16 9/8 19/16 5/4 4/3 17/12 3/2<br/>&gt; 19/12 5/3 15/8 2/1<br/>&gt; The empty space between 5/3 and 15/8 you could fill up by both going from 20<br/>&gt; to 21 and down from 15 to 14 giving both thesame frequency of 7/4<br/>&gt; so 1/1 17/16 9/8 19/16 5/4 4/3 17/12 3/2 19/12 5/3 7/4 15/8 2/1<br/>&gt; 2 harmonic segments a fifth apart interconnecting.<br/>&gt; This way of thinking does give me the nicest way of using the 7th harmonic<br/>&gt; melodically. It always seems to sound right when walking down to the 7th<br/>&gt; from 2/1 -&gt; 15/8 -&gt; 7/4<br/>&gt; But the 19/16 in minor chords, I don&apos;t like the sound of it. And in actual<br/>&gt; use it sounded pretty much like tempering to me with the extra disadvantage<br/>&gt; of still requiring comma shifts (even more than normal 5 or 7-limit JI).<br/>&gt; And in the end prefer my theory of harmony on how to contruct harmony, It<br/>&gt; makes deeper sense to me.<br/>&gt; But still looking at melody as segments of the harmonic series still makes<br/>&gt; sense to me. I personally don&apos;t know how to look at <a href="http://it.My">it.My</a> ear also fails me<br/>&gt; a lot when experimenting with the harmonic series.And i though lower prime<br/>&gt; limits would allow me to make things perfect and know that what i&apos;m doing is<br/>&gt; right because of pure harmonies.<br/>&gt; But now with this drei equali piece i seem to prefer dissonant chords in<br/>&gt; places where there could be a very consonant chord.<br/>&gt; So maybe it&apos;s back to the drawing board.<br/>&gt; Or maybe i can make it make perfect sense in 7 limit without comma shifts<br/>&gt; and my theory prevails.<br/>&gt; I guess what I&apos;m sayiing is, I don&apos;t know. And there doesn&apos;t seem to be a<br/>&gt; person in the world and never yet in the history of humanity existed a<br/>&gt; person that does know :)<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Marcel<br/>&gt;<br/>Hi Marcel,</p><p>Yes who knows exactly? As I say in my defence against you-know-who (see above or below), I am slowly coming to the conclusion that in the real world whole chunks of the harmonic series can be assigned to a single interval, even during the same note eg a singer inoffensively going slightly off pitch while holding the &apos;same&apos; note. I don&apos;t understand 7/6 in the dim chord. It doesn&apos;t seem close to the minor 3rd at all.</p><p>-Rick</p></div><h3><a id=82716 href="#82716">ðŸ”—</a>djtrancendance@...</h3><span>4/10/2009 8:36:05 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--1. only whole-numbered ratios produce periodic wave functions and --that<br/>the resultant frequency corresponds to the tonic.

Thought you joined the circus.</p><p>Well that hypothesis is not here exactly in this post but it is no doubt related. And it would be more precise to say that what mathematicians call the &quot;linear and homogeneous&quot; aspects of the space and time lines have all the appearance of periodicity i.e. we don&apos;t have to assume it a priory because it is supplied to us by observable light, matter and sound waves (which pretty much covers all of the senses), while this can also be proved mathematically. It begins as a self-evident first principle that philosophers of science have systematically overlooked. But like all first principles its significance only becomes clear in view of its consequences.</p><p>Starting with a simple sine wave sin2pi(vt - x/y) where v is freq and y wavelength, the values in the brackets represent number of cycles which I will call n. Therefore, from n = vt, since v = 1/T we obtain  t = nT. For length, x = ny. In other words, the t and x are dependent variables defined in proportion to period and wavelength, the factor of proportionality being the number of cycles. Note here that this is not just one sine wave but the algebraic representation of all such waves and therefore is completely general.</p><p>If we now add (say) two sine waves which share a GCD, say frequencies v/f = a/b where a and b are whole, it is found that the resultant period, call it R, gives R = a/v = b/f. As per usual, the factors of proportionality give v and f as the &apos;a&apos;th&apos; and &apos;b&apos;th&apos; harmonics of fundamental freq 1/R. However, observe that these have the same form as t = nT above i.e. that a and b are also numbers of cycles per a given time R. Also remember that this same proof of GCD is transitive and applies to any number of wave additions (as in 2. below). And the situation becomes even more interesting when we apply this same line of thought to standing waves. I can&apos;t write it here but without any design of my own we arrive at the conclusion that linear and homogeneous space and time are equal to the CLASS of spherical standing waves.</p><p>Finally, using this proportionality it is very easy to prove that all periods can form a modulus on the time line. For eg, given a freq of 2HZ and period 1/2 seconds, t = 3/4 sec is equivalent to t = 1/4 second mod(1/2).</p><p>The upshot I suppose is that scientists represent time by numbers and imagine that it represents &quot;time-as-history&quot;. However, they are invoking a number system of harmonia which dates right back to Pythagoras and the original mapping of rational string lengths onto the domain of &apos;time&apos; or frequency, hence the time LINE. Ironically, in view of the discovery that light and even matter itself propagates as a wave, at least this part of the ancient theory seems more objective than Newtonian-Einsteinian mechanics.</p><p>Sorry for the long answer</p><p>-Rick<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>P.S: In answer to Carl, I&apos;m well aware that this is quite idealistic in its current form, but a more thorough understanding of waves and perception will still make no difference to the underlying thought that our sense of time comes from waves and not vice-versa. For while you are pondering this fact in music theory on your computer, its light and electricity, and every object around you including yourself, is secretly confirming it. I would argue that the true idealism is the self-fulfilling theory of building clocks, calling it &quot;time&quot;, and then pretending that these objects come from nature. But that is another matter.</p><p>&gt; &gt; Twice now I (Rick) have posted the mathematical proof that<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; 1. only whole-numbered ratios produce periodic wave functions and that the<br/>&gt; &gt; resultant frequency corresponds to the tonic.

And I can see<br/>&gt; &gt; absolutely no reason why the &apos;irrationals&apos; Pi or Phi would be any exception.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; However, pi is used for expressing wave functions such as &quot;sin2pi*vt&quot;, and<br/>&gt; &gt; it is the number of cycles vt which indicates the interval, not the<br/>&gt; &gt; formalism of taking the angle pi in radians i.e. we don&apos;t take sin 2(pi^2)t.<br/>&gt; &gt; Perhaps there is some other law at play here, but we certainly don&apos;t yet<br/>&gt; &gt; know it.

Correct me if I&apos;m wrong but the Fourier Transform is usually used in acoustics to model non-periodic sounds like hand-claps etc. It can also be used to model periodic waves with a finite though indeterminate number of cycles per a given approximate time (short-time FT. I have certain problems with this model since it assumes accurate sine waves with definite cycles per time to begin with, but that discussion is for another time). And in the quantum application there is a pay-off between the frequency band-width and the length of time their product always being &gt; h/2. So I&apos;m having a little trouble understanding how the FT mathematics is applied to entropy. From what I can gather, the aim is to determine to what degree ratios have a reduced entropy (something like &apos;dissonance&apos; in the older terminology)?? If so, would I be right in saying that instead of pitting time against frequency, time being the domain (on the horizontal axis) and freq the range (on the vertical), the entropy model pits frequency against entropy, freq now being the domain? I realise its stupid but when you are used to something...</p><p>My second question is more problematic and concerns the fact that the frequencies surrounding each rational interval are continuous. The problem that has been lurking at the back of my mind, but which I have only now identified, is that this idea of continuity doesn&apos;t seem to distinguish between rational and irrationals, and ipso facto between periodic and aperiodic waves. Entropy is a measure of chaos. But if they really do exist, nothing would be more chaotic than an irrational wave which never repeats itself all the way to infinity (and according to Cantor there are an uncountably infinite number of them). Perhaps this IS a mathematical nicety which doesn&apos;t translate into the real world but if it is I&apos;d like to know it. And ironically, I was feeling that if I/we can find an uncertainty principle, then we might have found a loop-hole around these &apos;irrational&apos; waves (mathematicians are wrong: they are irrational in every sense of the word). For example, 5/4 has a low entropy. Some rational intervals that are close to it are 81/64, 161/128, 645/512 so I can assume (??) that these too are on the bell curve near 5/4 and therefore have slightly more entropy. Though they have a very long period of return relative to the original intervals, they are still periodic and this &apos;long&apos; period is naught compared to infinity. Yet the tempered fifth 2^(7/12) is also close and would have for all intents and purposes the same entropy. And so I am back to the same problem I began with; are the tempered intervals  really irrational or rationals approx to only a few decimal places?</p><p>Sorry for another long email but I just want to be clear.</p><p>Happy Easter</p><p>Rick</p></div><h3><a id=82766 href="#82766">ðŸ”—</a>Marcel de Velde &#x3C;m.develde@...&#x3E;</h3><span>4/12/2009 7:47:32 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Hi Rick,<br/>Without getting into specifics, it seems to me as if you&apos;re trying to make<br/>sense of the enthropy model as an exact model that explains how music works.<br/>I don&apos;t think the enthropy model is such a model.<br/>It only tells of consonance TO THE HUMAN EAR for 2 simultanious tones.<br/>I don&apos;t think the human ear is perfect and I don&apos;t think that all that music<br/>is, is so because of how the ear translates sound.<br/>Enthropy does not for instance model all the ways the brain interprets the<br/>data the ear converted from sound.<br/>To build a theory of music purely on enthropy is the wrong way imho.</p><p>Marcel</p></div><h3><a id=82770 href="#82770">ðŸ”—</a>Carl Lumma &#x3C;carl@...&#x3E;</h3><span>4/12/2009 10:05:22 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;rick_ballan&quot; &lt;rick_ballan@...&gt; wrote:</p><p>&gt; A few questions if you guys don&apos;t mind.

Correct me if I&apos;m<br/>&gt; &gt; wrong but the Fourier Transform is usually used in<br/>&gt; &gt; acoustics to model non-periodic sounds like hand-claps<br/>&gt; &gt; etc. It can also be used to model periodic waves with a<br/>&gt; &gt; finite though indeterminate number of cycles per a given<br/>&gt; &gt; approximate time (short-time FT. I have certain problems<br/>&gt; &gt; with this model since it assumes accurate sine waves with<br/>&gt; &gt; definite cycles per time to begin with, but that<br/>&gt; &gt; discussion is for another time). And in the quantum<br/>&gt; &gt; application there is a pay-off between the frequency<br/>&gt; &gt; band-width and the length of time their product always<br/>&gt; &gt; being &gt; h/2. So I&apos;m having a little trouble understanding<br/>&gt; &gt; how the FT mathematics is applied to entropy. From what I<br/>&gt; &gt; can gather, the aim is to determine to what degree ratios<br/>&gt; &gt; have a reduced entropy (something like &apos;dissonance&apos; in<br/>&gt; &gt; the older terminology)?? If so, would I be right in<br/>&gt; &gt; saying that instead of pitting time against frequency,<br/>&gt; &gt; time being the domain (on the horizontal axis) and freq<br/>&gt; &gt; the range (on the vertical), the entropy model pits<br/>&gt; &gt; frequency against entropy, freq now being the domain? I<br/>&gt; &gt; realise its stupid but when you are used to something...<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Fourier transforms are used to analyze sounds.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; What do you mean &quot;frequency band-width&quot;?  The quantum<br/>&gt; application follows from wave-particle duality, so quantum<br/>&gt; particles follow the classical uncertainty principle when<br/>&gt; they&apos;re being waves.</p><p>  Well the so-called &apos;particle&apos; aspect is also defined by a wave-packet and is still a wave. In this case there are an infinite and continuous number of frequencies within a given finite range producing an amplitude &apos;hump&apos; while the amplitudes outside that hump are negligible. Since the approx width of that hump in time is also finite then the probability of locating that &apos;particle&apos; within this time is very high.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I was talking about Shannon entropy, not harmonic entropy.<br/>&gt; The entropy of a signal is the maximum amount of information<br/>&gt; it might contain -- or the amount of randomness.  If you&apos;re<br/>&gt; listening to FM radio that entropy is determined by the<br/>&gt; bandwidth and how long you listen.  I don&apos;t know much beyond<br/>&gt; that because I haven&apos;t studied information theory.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; The idea of harmonic entropy is, I think, that dissonant<br/>&gt; intervals carry more information than consonant ones.  It&apos;s<br/>&gt; to do with how many different ratios you could assign to any<br/>&gt; given interval.  The &quot;entropy&quot; part comes directly from the<br/>&gt; formula for Shannon entropy.</p><p>  Ah that makes things clearer, thanks. I&apos;ll look into it.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; My second question is more problematic and concerns the<br/>&gt; &gt; fact that the frequencies surrounding each rational<br/>&gt; &gt; interval are continuous. The problem that has been<br/>&gt; &gt; lurking at the back of my mind, but which I have only now<br/>&gt; &gt; identified, is that this idea of continuity doesn&apos;t seem<br/>&gt; &gt; to distinguish between rational and irrationals, and ipso<br/>&gt; &gt; facto between periodic and aperiodic waves. Entropy is a<br/>&gt; &gt; measure of chaos. But if they really do exist, nothing<br/>&gt; &gt; would be more chaotic than an irrational wave which never<br/>&gt; &gt; repeats itself all the way to infinity (and according to<br/>&gt; &gt; Cantor there are an uncountably infinite number of them).<br/>&gt; &gt; Perhaps this IS a mathematical nicety which doesn&apos;t<br/>&gt; &gt; translate into the real world but if it is I&apos;d like to<br/>&gt; &gt; know it. And ironically, I was feeling that if I/we can<br/>&gt; &gt; find an uncertainty principle, then we might have found a<br/>&gt; &gt; loop-hole around these &apos;irrational&apos; waves (mathematicians<br/>&gt; &gt; are wrong: they are irrational in every sense of the<br/>&gt; &gt; word).

Your idea seems<br/>&gt; to assume irrationals.</p><p>  No I never said continuity of rationals. I said that it was continuous which means of course that it contains all the real numbers, both rationals and (mostly) irrationals. Just to be clear, the harmonic entropy model gives sharp drops in entropy around each rational number but it is surrounded by continuous irrationals.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; What has chaos got to do with it?</p><p>  Well Carl used this word in one of his posts. I suppose its just a  synonym for randomness.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Two sine waves playing together, an irrational interval<br/>&gt; apart, would carry very little information.  It doesn&apos;t<br/>&gt; matter that the signal doesn&apos;t repeat.  You can do a Fourier<br/>&gt; transform and show that it&apos;s always the same two frequencies.<br/>&gt;   It certainly isn&apos;t chaotic because you can predict what<br/>&gt; it&apos;ll look like at any point in time.</p><p>  Thanks Graham, I can now state my case a little clearer. Yes two sine waves an irrational interval apart would still be easily Fourier analysable and predictable, no less so than two rational waves. As you say both would carry very little information. However, the first problem I have with this interpretation is that in music at least waves don&apos;t &apos;carry&apos; (other) information but &apos;are&apos; the information. (I suppose a bit like McLuhan&apos;s &quot;The medium is the message&quot;). For eg, the perfect fifth 3/2 is a periodic wave and tonal while the flat-fifth sqrt2 is aperiodic and atonal. Hence my concerns about a model which gives continuity around each rational, effectively brushing over this distinction. Second, ALL waves are Fourier analysable irrespective of the &apos;amount of information&apos;, so this doesn&apos;t seem to be an argument either way. Since waves ARE the information and are not employed into the service of some other theory (both light and matter are composed of waves, and even chemistry is subject to wave theory), then I propose (as a hypothesis) that much of what we have previously defined as chaos, randomness etc...is nothing more than these irrational waves. For example, the situation becomes infinitely more complex when we begin to define frequency as the GCD and then add these in two or more irrational intervals. What if we take two irrational intervals, say sqrt2 and pi, then three, and so on? Each one of these will not repeat all the way to infinity, and each one different to the next! And what&apos;s worse, there are an uncountably infinite number of them. This number is so vast that according to Cantor, if we were to throw a dart on a number line, the chances of hitting a rational is so small as to be zero. So if we were to take a small sample of one of these waves, it would certainly appear &apos;chaotic&apos; or random. This is just an idea and I&apos;d be interested to know what you think.</p><p>-Rick<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Tempered intervals are, by definition, approximations to<br/>&gt; some other intervals.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;                      Graham<br/>&gt;</p></div><h3><a id=82916 href="#82916">ðŸ”—</a>Graham Breed &#x3C;gbreed@...&#x3E;</h3><span>4/16/2009 3:32:47 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>rick_ballan wrote:</p><p>[Most of this message is one paragraph, so I&apos;ll split it.]<br/>&gt; Thanks Graham, I can now state my case a little clearer.<br/>&gt; Yes two sine waves an irrational interval apart would<br/>&gt; still be easily Fourier analysable and predictable, no<br/>&gt; less so than two rational waves.

I don&apos;t know what the information-theoretic model is for that.  But it must come from an unequal probability for different intervals occurring.  Maybe assuming all rationals up to a given limit are equally likely.</p><p>That&apos;s never made a great deal of sense to me, I have to say.  But I can see that applying information to harmony can be useful.  You&apos;d have to talk about probabilities in the light of listeners&apos; expectations.  It&apos;s all about how predictable a signal is.  If you can always predict the next note/chord the entropy&apos;s going to be low.  And the music will be boring.  If you can never predict what&apos;s going to happen next, it&apos;s going to sound random, and that&apos;s not good either.  You can see a lot of conventional harmony as rules to avoid these two extremes.</p><p>&gt; Second, ALL waves are<br/>&gt; Fourier analysable irrespective of the &apos;amount of<br/>&gt; information&apos;, so this doesn&apos;t seem to be an argument<br/>&gt; either way.

There are very simple mathematical models for chaos.  One of the criteria is that the result shouldn&apos;t be periodic.  But another is that the evolution should be sensitive to initial conditions.  That is, a small difference in the parameters explodes so that the state at a future time is completely unpredictable unless you have infinite memory.</p><p>That doesn&apos;t apply to a signal made up of two sine waves at irrational intervals (which isn&apos;t itself a wave).  It isn&apos;t even truly aperiodic.  I think it&apos;d be described as &quot;quasi-periodic&quot;.  It almost repeats at various periods, corresponding to rational approximations to the interval.</p><p>&gt; For example, the situation<br/>&gt; becomes infinitely more complex when we begin to define<br/>&gt; frequency as the GCD and then add these in two or more<br/>&gt; irrational intervals. What if we take two irrational<br/>&gt; intervals, say sqrt2 and pi, then three, and so on?

This is just an idea and I&apos;d<br/>&gt; be interested to know what you think.</p><p>You&apos;re certainly going to have problems defining the GCD of irrational numbers.  You could say this is what the ear (or ear/brain system) does when it looks for the virtual pitch.   And you could solve the problem by substituting rational approximations.  The evidence suggests that what the ear does isn&apos;t this simple, and the threshold for recognizable rationality is very low, so theoretical irrational-ness doesn&apos;t enter in to it.</p><p>Yes, uncountability can be scary.  But there are different ways of looking at infinities.  You can also say that there are an infinite number of rational numbers between any pair of irrational numbers (and vice-versa).  So in that sense you can&apos;t say there are more of one than the other.  You can do any calculation to tolerable precision using rationals (and &quot;real&quot; numbers as stored in computers are normally rational approximations).  I practical terms you can go a long way by ignoring irrationals.</p><p>A small sample of a signal of two sine waves would look very simple.  If you could sample it with infinite precision you could deduce its nature.  If you quantize it, it will look *identical* to a pair of sine waves at a rational interval, and therefore periodic given the GCD.</p><p>If you&apos;ve worked with discrete Fourier transforms, you&apos;ll have noticed that all intervals between the partials they show are rational.  That&apos;s because it&apos;s really a Fourier series that assumes you have one period of a waveform.  It&apos;s that uncertainty principle biting you again.</p><p>                       Graham</p></div><h3><a id=83806 href="#83806">ðŸ”—</a>tuning@yahoogroups.com</h3><span>6/2/2009 6:27:15 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Hello,</p><p>This email message is a notification to let you know that<br/>a file has been uploaded to the Files area of the tuning<br/>group.</p><p>  File        : /C Major-Chord wave peaks-E.Temp.- Piagui I.doc<br/>  Uploaded by : piaguiscale &lt;piagui@...&gt;<br/>  Description : Chord diagram- A view to the quality of  its harmony</p><p>You can access this file at the URL:<br/><a href="http://groups.yahoo.com/group/tuning/files/C%20Major-Chord%20wave%20peaks-E.Temp.-%20Piagui%20I.doc">http://groups.yahoo.com/group/tuning/files/C%20Major-Chord%20wave%20peaks-E.Temp.-%20Piagui%20I.doc</a></p><p>To learn more about file sharing for your group, please visit:<br/><a href="http://help.yahoo.com/l/us/yahoo/groups/original/members/web/index.htmlfiles">http://help.yahoo.com/l/us/yahoo/groups/original/members/web/index.htmlfiles</a></p><p>Regards,</p><p>piaguiscale &lt;piagui@...&gt;</p></div><h3><a id=83814 href="#83814">ðŸ”—</a>tuning@yahoogroups.com</h3><span>6/4/2009 9:15:28 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Hello,</p><p>This email message is a notification to let you know that<br/>a file has been uploaded to the Files area of the tuning<br/>group.</p><p>  File        : /Piagui I-Perfect fifths and Perfect fourths Diagram.doc<br/>  Uploaded by : piaguiscale &lt;piagui@...&gt;<br/>  Description : Cyclical perfect fifths and perfect fourths intervals link all the tones of Piagui I variant along four octaves and more.</p><p>You can access this file at the URL:<br/><a href="http://groups.yahoo.com/group/tuning/files/Piagui%20I-Perfect%20fifths%20and%20Perfect%20fourths%20Diagram.doc">http://groups.yahoo.com/group/tuning/files/Piagui%20I-Perfect%20fifths%20and%20Perfect%20fourths%20Diagram.doc</a></p><p>To learn more about file sharing for your group, please visit:<br/><a href="http://help.yahoo.com/l/us/yahoo/groups/original/members/web/index.htmlfiles">http://help.yahoo.com/l/us/yahoo/groups/original/members/web/index.htmlfiles</a></p><p>Regards,</p><p>piaguiscale &lt;piagui@...&gt;</p></div><h3><a id=83815 href="#83815">ðŸ”—</a>tuning@yahoogroups.com</h3><span>6/4/2009 9:40:44 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Hello,</p><p>This email message is a notification to let you know that<br/>a file has been uploaded to the Files area of the tuning<br/>group.</p><p>  File        : /GRAPHS 7- 8 D MAJOR (86 KB).JPG<br/>  Uploaded by : piaguiscale &lt;piagui@...&gt;<br/>  Description : The Piagui D major response is a sign of high quality harmony that differs from a caotic e-tempered display.

If you want a<br/>scale with both a manageable number of tones and big consonant<br/>high-limit chords there is a problem. The bigger the chords the less<br/>there are chord roots at which the bass line can rest. When the whole<br/>scale is a chord you most likely will have only one scale degree<br/>against which the scale sounds stable when played as a chord. Without<br/>multiple points of repose you don&apos;t really have chord progressions or<br/>satisfying bass lines that go somewhere. I don&apos;t know about you, but<br/>I think that is just boring to the max!</p><p>And if you wonder why the scales with many smaller basic chords tend<br/>to be 5- and 7-limit I think this is because intervals lower in the<br/>harmonic series (particularly the 2:3) must be included in a chord if<br/>there is to be a strong sense of root. Smaller chords can include<br/>fewer intervals than big ones. Intervals higher up in the harmonic<br/>series don&apos;t sound particularly nice without the &quot;scaffolding&quot; of<br/>lower ones. I think that explains the popularity of 5- and 7-limit.</p><p>Kalle Aho</p></div><h3><a id=86842 href="#86842">ðŸ”—</a>Michael &#x3C;djtrancendance@...&#x3E;</h3><span>2/26/2010 3:16:43 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Kalle&gt;&quot;When the whole scale is a chord you most likely will have only one scale degree<br/>against which the scale sounds stable when played as a chord.&quot;<br/>    What do you mean by &quot;one scale degree&quot;?  I&apos;ve found several scales that more or less work as &quot;chord scales&quot; that work well across multiple octaves and can change feel by changing root tone very well.<br/>    I will  also say...having the whole scale be a low-limit chord get boring very quickly as there isn&apos;t much possible by way of changing tonal color by, say, changing the bass note used.<br/>    That&apos;s why I prefer having so called &quot;scale chords&quot; have a fairly high common denominator such as 18 or 24 where you get x/6, x/3, x/2, x/4, x/9, x/12 harmonic series segment sub-chords possible from within the major x/18, x/24...chord .

These JI chords don&apos;t sound like chords at all to me, they just sound like a thickening of the timbre.  Perhaps if it was rendered by an actual ensemble and not a soundfont, the JI would sound better (i.e. I would be able to hear the chords), but as it stands, it&apos;s like some weird sonic illusion--I can&apos;t tell if the chord is major or minor until one of the notes drifts out of tune when the vibrato kicks in.</p><p>I think you&apos;ve definitely succeeded, Marcel, but I don&apos;t know if that&apos;s a good thing.  You&apos;ve proven that you can successfully render common-practice music in pure 6-limit JI without it sounding &quot;wrong&quot;, and yet I daresay I dislike the purity of it.  The voices become too indistinct when the harmonies are so pure, and I can&apos;t make out the chords.  To me, this lessens the emotional impact of the piece.  Though like I said, maybe it&apos;s just the soundfont...but then, I doubt an ensemble of trombones could ever render your pure JI in practice.  Perhaps nothing short of a synthesizer ever could.

Octaves are only really stretched in the<br/>&gt; &gt; extreme registers of the instrument.

For one thing, instead<br/>of saying the octaves are &gt; 2, you can just as well define a<br/>method of calculating fundamental pitch that makes the octaves<br/>exactly 2.  In fact that&apos;s arguably a simpler way to account<br/>for the fact that the ideal stretch isn&apos;t constant across the<br/>keyboard... analogous to say, tuning the octaves beatless by<br/>ear instead remembering all the numbers in a stretch curve.</p><p>FWIW, I have tuned several pianos in 5- and 7-limit JI and on<br/>one occasion I made all the octaves 1200 cents, according to<br/>Peterson.  It sounded just fine (after a fashion) though<br/>definitely not the same as if I&apos;d stretched them.</p><p>&gt;So is the &quot;inharmonicity&quot; of the piano a myth, or is it<br/>&gt;just insignificant in tuning a piano?</p><p>It&apos;s certainly significant in the lowest octave or two of<br/>the instrument -- those big wound strings are highly<br/>inharmonic.  But because the critical bandwidth is so wide<br/>at low frequencies, we seldom play chords in the bass and<br/>the inharmonicity of those strings isn&apos;t such a big deal.</p><p>In addition to inharmonicity, there are nonlinearities in<br/>human pitch perception over the enormous compass of the<br/>modern piano, even with sine tones.  And even after you&apos;ve<br/>taken care of all that, extra stretch gives a certain<br/>metallophone-like quality to the instrument that some<br/>prefer (according to Easley Blackwood, tuners tend to use<br/>much more stretch on concert grands than on other pianos<br/>for some reason, even though the former have longer strings<br/>and therefore less inharmonicity).</p><p>&gt; Gosh, I seem to remember Michael harping on my &quot;max<br/>&gt; dissonance&quot; experiments because I used a piano as the main<br/>&gt; sound, since he claimed the piano is a &quot;cheating&quot; timbre<br/>&gt; due to its inharmonicity...</p><p>Yes well, don&apos;t believe everything you hear... especially<br/>if you hear it from Michael.</p><p>&gt; yet I always swore that pianos sounded gosh-darn harmonic<br/>&gt; to my ears!

Yes I&apos;m talking about dyads like 50/33, 22/15 and 13/9.<br/>  I&apos;m obviously not saying pure fifths are bad, but the process of trying to<br/>force almost every fifth to be pure of within a few cents of pure often seems to<br/>have a nasty habit of knocking otherwise great scales and tunings out of<br/>considerations in people&apos;s mind.</p><p>******************************</p><p>   General comment: this board seems to have very little respect for ideas with<br/>even the slightest bit of controversial (even if stated clearly as subjective or<br/>as an alternative not a replacement) information.

I could understand if someone<br/>said something very objective like &quot;Marcel&apos;s chord has only one strict JI dyad&quot;<br/>but saying &quot;this is sour and not JI&quot; is not only vague but wrong.  All JI<br/>is...is explained on <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Just_intonation">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Just_intonation</a> as &quot;any<br/>musical tuning in which the frequencies of notes are related by ratios of small<br/>whole numbers.&quot;.  It doesn&apos;t say anything about how small a number in a fraction<br/>has to be to make it JI or even if there&apos;s a strict definition for a JI chord.<br/>And even the JI Diatonic scale is really an x/24 scale just like Marcel&apos;s said<br/>above chord is an x/24 chord.</p><p>  On the side, I&apos;ve heard Carl&apos;s view a million times, which in that odd-limit<br/>is the only real way to rate chord consonance.<br/>  And frankly I don&apos;t agree with it as the only way: I think critical band,<br/>having many independently consonant dyads (even if the outer tones in the chord<br/>form a sour dyad!), if there dyads are ordered from largest to smallest (IE<br/>major vs. minor shaped)...all can work to make &quot;even&quot; a high odd-limit sour<br/>sound non-sour.<br/>  And Marcel and I have a right to stand by our opinions without being blasted<br/>for it.  Now if Marcel was calling his chord &quot;strict JI&quot; he would be mis-stating<br/>an objective fact...but that&apos;s not what he&apos;s doing.</p><p>**********************</p><p>  Why not keep the objective objective and the subjective subjective?

Firstly it seems<br/>&quot;wolf fifths&quot; can be made pure by combining them in chords with other dyads that<br/>are pure or near pure, much as Igs has done.<br/>  Secondly, there are alternative 5ths like 22/15 and 50/33 that seem to need<br/>very little support (maybe just one other/extra pure dyad in a chord to &apos;help<br/>out&apos;) to sound quite resolved.</p><p>  And yes of course nothing is going to sound as pure as a 3/2 fifth, but would<br/>having, say, an &quot;alternative 5th&quot; which sounds more like a 7/6 or 5/4 so far as<br/>consonance really be that terrible?  Plus it adds variety and enables OTHER<br/>intervals in a scale to often be either more accurate, more exotic (but still<br/>managably consonant), or both.</p><p>_,_._,___</p></div><h3><a id=90970 href="#90970">ðŸ”—</a>Michael &#x3C;djtrancendance@...&#x3E;</h3><span>7/13/2010 11:56:51 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Carl&gt;&quot;You&apos;ve got to distinguish between chords and scales.<br/>It&apos;s not entirely clear what counts as a just scale, but<br/>it is fairly well established what counts as a just chord.&quot;</p><p>   You have lectured me about this as well.

You could be the person that would be able to do it, if you wish !<br/>2) Such a definition would help to quantify the degree of -c in a scale, but the musical interest of the differential coherence of a scale is elsewhere.<br/>I will just take two scales in example with below their 1 &amp; 2 degrees differentials :</p><p>6 : 7 : 8 : 9 : 10 : 11 : 12<br/>1  1  1  1  1  1 ;<br/>2  2  2  2  2  3 ;</p><p>and<br/>64  76  80-81  96  101  120  128<br/>12  4  1  15  5  19  8 ;<br/>16  15  16  20  24  27  32 ;</p><p>The first one is maximally -c, since 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 belong to octaves of the scale - but the differentials are completely boring !<br/>The second one may not be 100% -c, but the differentials sing in echo to the scale (they have 12, 15, 16, 19, 20)  : that&apos;s what makes them more musical.<br/>You can see also that commas may help to the coherence and diversity of the differentials : another factor that can complicate a general method of analysis.<br/>- - - - - - - -<br/>Jacques</p></div><h3><a id=93572 href="#93572">ðŸ”—</a>tuning@yahoogroups.com</h3><span>10/8/2010 12:22:11 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Hello,</p><p>This email message is a notification to let you know that<br/>a file has been uploaded to the Files area of the tuning<br/>group.</p><p>  File        : /CameronBobro/Impossible.mp3<br/>  Uploaded by : misterbobro &lt;misterbobro@...&gt;<br/>  Description : 9:7 sung cold</p><p>You can access this file at the URL:<br/><a href="http://groups.yahoo.com/group/tuning/files/CameronBobro/Impossible.mp3">http://groups.yahoo.com/group/tuning/files/CameronBobro/Impossible.mp3</a></p><p>To learn more about file sharing for your group, please visit:<br/><a href="http://help.yahoo.com/l/us/yahoo/groups/original/members/forms/general.htmlfiles">http://help.yahoo.com/l/us/yahoo/groups/original/members/forms/general.htmlfiles</a></p><p>Regards,</p><p>misterbobro &lt;misterbobro@...&gt;</p></div><h3><a id=93712 href="#93712">ðŸ”—</a>tuning@yahoogroups.com</h3><span>10/18/2010 10:49:21 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Hello,</p><p>This email message is a notification to let you know that<br/>a file has been uploaded to the Files area of the tuning<br/>group.</p><p>  File        : /SteveMartin/tminmax2.png<br/>  Uploaded by : martinsj013 &lt;martinsj@...&gt;<br/>  Description : Triadic HE - graph of mins and maxs (Tenney 10K)</p><p>You can access this file at the URL:<br/><a href="http://groups.yahoo.com/group/tuning/files/SteveMartin/tminmax2.png">http://groups.yahoo.com/group/tuning/files/SteveMartin/tminmax2.png</a></p><p>To learn more about file sharing for your group, please visit:<br/><a href="http://help.yahoo.com/l/us/yahoo/groups/original/members/forms/general.htmlfiles">http://help.yahoo.com/l/us/yahoo/groups/original/members/forms/general.htmlfiles</a></p><p>Regards,</p><p>martinsj013 &lt;martinsj@...&gt;</p></div><h3><a id=93772 href="#93772">ðŸ”—</a>tuning@yahoogroups.com</h3><span>10/21/2010 3:43:14 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Hello,</p><p>This email message is a notification to let you know that<br/>a file has been uploaded to the Files area of the tuning<br/>group.</p><p>  File        : /CameronBobro/SHE01mp3.mp3<br/>  Uploaded by : misterbobro &lt;misterbobro@...&gt;<br/>  Description : Demonstration of HE observations</p><p>You can access this file at the URL:<br/><a href="http://groups.yahoo.com/group/tuning/files/CameronBobro/SHE01mp3.mp3">http://groups.yahoo.com/group/tuning/files/CameronBobro/SHE01mp3.mp3</a></p><p>To learn more about file sharing for your group, please visit:<br/><a href="http://help.yahoo.com/l/us/yahoo/groups/original/members/forms/general.htmlfiles">http://help.yahoo.com/l/us/yahoo/groups/original/members/forms/general.htmlfiles</a></p><p>Regards,</p><p>misterbobro &lt;misterbobro@...&gt;</p></div><h3><a id=93774 href="#93774">ðŸ”—</a>cameron &#x3C;misterbobro@...&#x3E;</h3><span>10/21/2010 3:49:32 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>I think the best general description of &quot;low harmonic entropy&quot;, in terms of human perception, is probably &quot;clarity&quot;.

Sounds a little bit<br/>softer than the first one really.&quot;</p><p>   Firstly...I specify a parameter for the maximum dissonance I allow for each<br/>FFT block....</p><p>   For each FFT block...I&apos;m taking the amplitude of all partials.  For each<br/>partial I have a sub-loop which loops through each other partial each throw it<br/>into Sethares&apos; dyadic dissonance formula IE result =<br/>Dissonance(FFT_array[root_partial], FFT_array[other_partial])<br/>   I am then taking a sum of the results of all possible dyadic dissonances IE<br/>dissonancesum = dissonancesum + result and keeping track of the number of<br/>comparisons IE comparison++.<br/>  After the partial comparing loop...I am taking the average IE average =<br/>dissonancesum / comparisons</p><p>  Lastly I<br/>A) Check if the dissonance average for that block is higher than the maximum<br/>dissonance parameter<br/>B) If so, I loop through each amplitude value in the FFT array and scaling down<br/>the amplitude IE amplitude * (maxdissonance / average).</p><p>This way the whole FFT block, in time, becomes significantly softer if/when it<br/>goes over the maximum dissonance...but otherwise gets left alone.  Hence parts<br/>like the snare attack and the &quot;click&quot; of the bass drum kick, as well as certain<br/>points where a note and drum hit at the same time and cause very nearby high<br/>amplitude partials...become significantly softer while the &quot;ambient&quot; part of the<br/>sound stays more-or-less the same.</p><p>Me&gt;    In case any of you all are wondering...the file with alignment  to<br/>microtonal scale ONLY uses about 100 FFT bin partials to recreate the  sound<br/>instead of 2048...so it could be used for sound compression to a  downsampled<br/>wave file if only I could massively pitch shift those  partials down to the<br/>first 100 of 2048 bins of the fft and then  downsample the result without lots<br/>of distortion ....</p><p>MikeB&gt;&quot;Not sure what you mean by 128 FFT bin partials. You&apos;re only taking a<br/>128-point FFT here?&quot;</p><p>  No meaning...I meant shifting all amplitude/phase values of the loud IE<br/>harmonic/overtone partials the first 120 parts of the FFT array and leaving the<br/>remaining parts (121-2048) BLANK IE zeroed out.  In other words...pushing all<br/>the high frequency data into MUCH lower frequencies.  Once everything is shifted<br/>as such, I can perform the inverse FFT to get a wave file with only low<br/>frequencies...and then downsample/shrink the wave file without losing any (high)<br/>frequency info....that&apos;s how the compression system works.</p></div><h3><a id=96276 href="#96276">ðŸ”—</a>tuning@yahoogroups.com</h3><span>2/13/2011 1:36:19 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Hello,</p><p>This email message is a notification to let you know that<br/>a file has been uploaded to the Files area of the tuning<br/>group.</p><p>  File        : /MichaelSheiman/I hate twenty two over 15 scale.tun<br/>  Uploaded by : djtrancendance &lt;djtrancendance@...&gt;<br/>  Description : MOS scale using a 13/9 &quot;alternative fifth&quot;</p><p>You can access this file at the URL:<br/><a href="http://groups.yahoo.com/group/tuning/files/MichaelSheiman/I%20hate%20twenty%20two%20over%2015%20scale.tun">http://groups.yahoo.com/group/tuning/files/MichaelSheiman/I%20hate%20twenty%20two%20over%2015%20scale.tun</a></p><p>To learn more about file sharing for your group, please visit:<br/><a href="http://help.yahoo.com/l/us/yahoo/groups/original/members/web/index.html">http://help.yahoo.com/l/us/yahoo/groups/original/members/web/index.html</a><br/>Regards,</p><p>djtrancendance &lt;djtrancendance@...&gt;</p></div><h3><a id=96277 href="#96277">ðŸ”—</a>tuning@yahoogroups.com</h3><span>2/13/2011 1:37:08 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Hello,</p><p>This email message is a notification to let you know that<br/>a file has been uploaded to the Files area of the tuning<br/>group.</p><p>  File        : /MichaelSheiman/I hate twenth two over 15 LOWER LIMIT.scl<br/>  Uploaded by : djtrancendance &lt;djtrancendance@...&gt;<br/>  Description : MOS scale using a 13/9 &quot;alternative fifth&quot;</p><p>You can access this file at the URL:<br/><a href="http://groups.yahoo.com/group/tuning/files/MichaelSheiman/I%20hate%20twenth%20two%20over%2015%20LOWER%20LIMIT.scl">http://groups.yahoo.com/group/tuning/files/MichaelSheiman/I%20hate%20twenth%20two%20over%2015%20LOWER%20LIMIT.scl</a></p><p>To learn more about file sharing for your group, please visit:<br/><a href="http://help.yahoo.com/l/us/yahoo/groups/original/members/web/index.html">http://help.yahoo.com/l/us/yahoo/groups/original/members/web/index.html</a><br/>Regards,</p><p>djtrancendance &lt;djtrancendance@...&gt;</p></div><h3><a id=96278 href="#96278">ðŸ”—</a>tuning@yahoogroups.com</h3><span>2/13/2011 1:38:54 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Hello,</p><p>This email message is a notification to let you know that<br/>a file has been uploaded to the Files area of the tuning<br/>group.</p><p>  File        : /MichaelSheiman/I hate twenty two over fifteen MELODIC EXAMPLE.mp3<br/>  Uploaded by : djtrancendance &lt;djtrancendance@...&gt;<br/>  Description : Melodic example of 13/9 alternative fifth MOS scale</p><p>You can access this file at the URL:<br/><a href="http://groups.yahoo.com/group/tuning/files/MichaelSheiman/I%20hate%20twenty%20two%20over%20fifteen%20MELODIC%20EXAMPLE.mp3">http://groups.yahoo.com/group/tuning/files/MichaelSheiman/I%20hate%20twenty%20two%20over%20fifteen%20MELODIC%20EXAMPLE.mp3</a></p><p>To learn more about file sharing for your group, please visit:<br/><a href="http://help.yahoo.com/l/us/yahoo/groups/original/members/web/index.html">http://help.yahoo.com/l/us/yahoo/groups/original/members/web/index.html</a><br/>Regards,</p><p>djtrancendance &lt;djtrancendance@...&gt;</p></div><h3><a id=96561 href="#96561">ðŸ”—</a>tuning@yahoogroups.com</h3><span>3/1/2011 12:51:38 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Hello,</p><p>This email message is a notification to let you know that<br/>a file has been uploaded to the Files area of the tuning<br/>group.</p><p>  File        : /MichaelSheiman/getchordJI.html<br/>  Uploaded by : djtrancendance &lt;djtrancendance@...&gt;<br/>  Description : HTML web page finds the nearest JI chord when given up to seven frequencies.

meaning notes over 10/7 and under or equal to 11/7 that are not near 3/2.<br/>&nbsp; But then you said &quot;they aren&apos;t fifths because only the perfect fifth is a real fifth and alternative fifth indirectly implies they would be &quot;proper fifths&quot;...so you suggested I should call them &quot;alternatives-to-5ths&quot;.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;

In the case of this scale, the scale is roughly formed by 22/15 * 11/7 * 13/9 * 22/15 * 13/9 * 22/15 * 14/9...then reduced to the octave.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p></div><h3><a id=97622 href="#97622">ðŸ”—</a>genewardsmith &#x3C;genewardsmith@...&#x3E;</h3><span>4/4/2011 12:39:33 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px;

They&apos;re all tempered 22:26:33 (the i, iv, and v, using the 13/11) or 34:42:51 (the II and V, using the 26/21) chords. There aren&apos;t any other triads in the piece.</p><p>I didn&apos;t really pay attention to the ratios while I was composing, mind you. I think the 13/11 doesn&apos;t sound so far off from a 12-EDO minor third, so it seems familiar; I&apos;m guessing that it&apos;s the 34:42:51 that sounds like &quot;odd intervals&quot;.</p><p>&gt; The 14/11 seems promising...not far from the &quot;tonal gravity&quot; of 9/7.</p><p>I seem not to be a fan of sharp thirds, so I don&apos;t anticipate composing a lot of stuff with the 14/11 major triads. To each his own, though.</p><p>&gt; &gt; &quot;There&apos;s also this quirky 26/21, 368-cent flattish major third<br/>&gt; &gt; when you build a triad on the 3rd or 8th step of the scale&quot;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;   Very neat...you fooled me by saying you used this a lot because<br/>&gt; I&apos;d never guess (most of the thirds sound fairly normal to me and<br/>&gt; 26/21 is very near neither 11/9 nor 5/4.</p><p>Yeah, it sounds normal-ish here, but do a Gsus4 --&gt; G major (i.e., Vsus4 --&gt; V in the key of C). I think even a deaf muezzin would look at you and say, &quot;What the hell was *that*?&quot;</p><p>I think it works in this context because the melody first goes C-Eb-G-Ab, or 0-288-704-784 cents (the last step is only 80 cents) and then, the next time around, goes C-Eb-G-F#, or 0-288-704-576 cents (the last step is 128 cents). Even though the Ab and the F# are both a single scale step away from the G, the F# is a lot farther away in absolute terms, which makes it feel a little more diatonic or &quot;natural&quot; or something. Yeah, it&apos;s really flat, but the close Ab above makes you *want* something flat below.</p><p>As I was discussing with Igs a while back, it seems to me that the individual dyads matter somewhat less than the scale structure and compositional context. That certainly seems to be the case here.</p><p>I think. I mean, I&apos;m not really a composer, and I&apos;m certainly not a microtonal composer, and I&apos;m just making up the explanations as I go. But the point of the composition was to experiment, and what I say above is what it *feels* like the result of the experiment was. Not scientific, but plausible at least.</p><p>&gt; I think 13/11 sounds terrible by itself but I liked your piece.</p><p>If you listen to the overly-repetitious-please-make-it-stop-droning piano part, the first beat of the measure is usually the root+3rd of the chord; you&apos;re hearing a lot of 13/11 by itself (and some 26/21 by itself).</p><p>Interesting, no? That&apos;s part of the reason this scale interested me: Gene threw out this weird subgroup (2.3.11/7.13/7 -- though I had to pester him about what that meant, and why it was weird, and why he chose the intervals he did, and so on) and yet the scale sounded good. Go figure.</p><p>Regards,<br/>Jake</p></div><h3><a id=97695 href="#97695">ðŸ”—</a>genewardsmith &#x3C;genewardsmith@...&#x3E;</h3><span>4/5/2011 10:20:25 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, Michael &lt;djtrancendance@...&gt; wrote:</p><p>&gt; &nbsp;&nbsp; 10/7 could work...but what scales would you recommend generated by just 10/7 and not 10/7 with no perfect fifths?</p><p>The temperament &quot;tridec&quot; in the chromatic pairs Xenwiki catalog comes close:</p><p><a href="http://xenharmonic.wikispaces.com/Tridec8">http://xenharmonic.wikispaces.com/Tridec8</a><br/><a href="http://xenharmonic.wikispaces.com/Tridec13">http://xenharmonic.wikispaces.com/Tridec13</a><br/><a href="http://xenharmonic.wikispaces.com/Chromatic+pairs#Tridec">http://xenharmonic.wikispaces.com/Chromatic+pairs#Tridec</a></p><p>Of course, it&apos;s far from proper but I&apos;m afraid the 10/7 generator idea sticks you with that.

If you got used to another scale in which<br/>5/4 subtended 4 steps, you&apos;d start thinking of it as a &quot;fourth.&quot; Of<br/>course, you&apos;d probably still call it a &quot;major third&quot; just because of<br/>convention, but you&apos;d intuitively become aware of that there are two<br/>notes between the root and the 5/4, not just one.</p><p>A good rule of thumb for MOS scales is that if L&gt;2s, the scale is<br/>improper; if L=2s, it&apos;s proper, and if L&lt;2s, it&apos;s strictly proper.<br/>This only applies if there is more than one &quot;s&quot; sized interval in the<br/>scale, however, so porcupine[8] in 22-tet is proper although L=3s.</p><p>You should also know that propriety can be defined without recourse to<br/>ratios at all - I just said that above to simplify.</p><p>-Mike</p></div><h3><a id=97707 href="#97707">ðŸ”—</a>Chris Vaisvil &#x3C;chrisvaisvil@...&#x3E;</h3><span>4/6/2011 7:00:26 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>&gt; No... not quite.

That&apos;s because if you use a generator of 200/243 in amity rather than 243/200, then a major triad in amity uses generator numbers &quot;0, 5, 13&quot; while a major triad in unicorn uses generator numbers &quot;-13, -8, 0&quot;, which is actually the same thing raised by 13. Therefore, some chord progressions can even come out the same when switching between unicorn and amity (only the bass tones differ) while others will change. The MIDI files and Scala files contained in this archive let you verify it for yourselves.
