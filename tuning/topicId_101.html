Already we<br/>seem to have some new members and the list is<br/>as busy or busier than before.</p><p>This got lost in theTuning list shuffle last month.....</p><p>* * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * *</p><p>Just got back from NYC and hearing Birdhouse play at the Mercury Lounge.</p><p>They&apos;ve reinvented the band, now with Hansford Rowe on bass<br/>and Jim Mussen on drums. So if you heard the cd or the old band with<br/>Brad Catler on percussion, this was a different gig. Birdhouse is<br/>now a rock band that&apos;s very cool. They opened with a long new piece<br/>(title escapes me, Hummingbird *something*), Jon Catler playing<br/>his new fretless G&amp;L...exploring a bit of feedback and rocking out.</p><p>Hansford was playing a JI bass (a photo *used* to be linked up to the<br/>1/1 web page).</p><p>They finished out the set with tunes from the CD, also played Wood<br/>Pecker from the Catler Bros. Crash Landing CD.<br/>Brad was playing this on fretless bass, now Hansford<br/>is using the fretted JI bass which is more punchy.  It was interesting<br/>to hear bass on a few of the tunes that didn&apos;t originally have bass.</p><p>Of course Meredith Borden is an amazing singer, she sings real bluesy<br/>material and then whips out the birdsong/opera background. And this<br/>new guy Mussen, he&apos;s real solid and flexable - a great drummer.</p><p>The show was video taped for Manhattan Cable, after the gig,<br/>the band was interviewed. Halfways through the interview, I<br/>somehow ended up doing the interview (I know the woman who was<br/>doing the interview, out of the blue, she handed me the microphone).<br/>It was interesting to listen to Jon explain tuning, I wonder what the<br/>audience is going to make of it.</p><p>* * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * *</p><p>No, I don&apos;t know when it will be on.<br/>Yes, I will let the list know when it will be on TV.<br/>No, I can&apos;t tape it - I don&apos;t live in Manhattan.</p><p>Happy New Ear folks.....</p><p>--<br/>* D a v i d        B e a r d s l e y<br/>*           <a href="mailto:xouoxno@virtulink.com">xouoxno@virtulink.com</a><br/>*<br/>* J u x t a p o s i t i o n     E z i n e<br/>* M E L A  v i r t u a l  d r e a m house monitor<br/>*<br/>* <a href="http://www.virtulink.com/immp/lookhere.htm">http://www.virtulink.com/immp/lookhere.htm</a></p></div>
