Then, assign a<br/>number from 1 to 24 to Controller 6 (data entry.) That last number defines<br/>the number of pitches , the default being two semitones from one end to<br/>t&apos;other. You can insert all three messages at the same start-time.<br/>In addition, you can tune the whole synth so you have your choice of &quot;early<br/>music&quot; pitches. for coarse tuning:<br/>CC 101--0, cc100--2, cc6-- 40 to 88. 64 is the default, nubers on either<br/>change the pitch by one semitone.<br/>For fine tuning:<br/>cc101--0 cc100--1 cc 6--14 to 124. 64 yields A 440, increments change the<br/>pitch by approx 1.5 cents.</p></div><h3>John A. deLaubenfels &#x3C;jadl@xxxxxx.xxxx&#x3E;</h3><span>9/20/1999 8:25:43 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>(I sent this yesterday and it seemed to be eaten; if it appears<br/>twice, my apologies...)</p><p>[Joe Monzo, TD 317.1:]<br/>&gt;&gt; I don&apos;t know what&apos;s happening, but your retuned versions<br/>&gt;&gt; of both this Beethoven piece and the MIDI sequences of my<br/>&gt;&gt; piano pieces, sound nothing like they&apos;re supposed to!<br/>&gt;&gt; Apparently, there&apos;s something very wrong with the Pitch<br/>&gt;&gt; Wheel settings as they&apos;re being played on my system.
