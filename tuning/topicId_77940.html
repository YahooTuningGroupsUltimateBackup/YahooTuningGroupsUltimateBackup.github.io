The notable Delezenne and Pythagoras were the fathers of that fundamental relation called schisma. In 1560, Zarlino used the chromatic semitone 135 /128 proposed by Delezenne and divided by the Pytagoras semitone to get a very small coma:    (135 / 128) / (256 / 243) = (32805 / 32768). Some analysts accept to call it &quot;schisma&quot; and not &quot;coma&quot; or comma&quot;.</p><p>Conclusion:<br/>The two numbers of the fraction 256 /243 don&acute;t make consonance, however the fraction is the Pythagoras semitone. Here started the wrong custom of calling smallest consonance to ratio 32805 / 32768. In my case, it was a wrong typing.</p><p>-- I think that the correct terms for calling to 32805 / 32768 are two:</p><p>Your way : &quot;the smallest interval that can be distinguished by the ear of man&quot; and also:</p><p>&quot;the smallest frequency ratio that can be distinguished by the ear of man&quot;. This second definition supposses that first we have to generate a frequency that is (135 / 128) = 1,0546875 times a reference frequency, then another       (256 / 243) = 1,053497942 times the same reference, and compare the sounds.</p><p>I detected by ear that smallest comma by using the Piagui guitar,</p><p>Regards</p><p>MARIO PIZARRO</p><p>piagui@...</p></div>
