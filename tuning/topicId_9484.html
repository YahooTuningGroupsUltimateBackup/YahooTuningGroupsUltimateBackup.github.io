This<br/>rule sometimes gives us a choice between two solutions in a cadence to<br/>a given note, here shown in a notation where C4 is middle C and higher<br/>note numbers show higher octaves:</p><p>   C#4 D4         C4    D4<br/>   G#3 A3         G3    A3<br/>   E3  D3         Eb3   D3</p><p>(M6-8 + M3-5)   (M6-8 + M3-5)</p><p>These progressions include accidentals which theorists of the time<br/>explain in vertical terms, as do I. Of course, at the same time, the<br/>narrow Pythagorean semitones have a very nice melodic effect also.<br/>The important point is that often the two dimensions harmoniously<br/>unite; but someone unfamiliar with the rule of M3-5, for example,<br/>might attempt to describe the motivation for accidentals such as the<br/>G# in the first example as &quot;purely melodic.&quot;</p><p>As I have commented in other articles, the basic distinction between<br/>medieval, Renaissance, and Manneristic verticality for three or more<br/>voices (c. 1200-1640) and the era of c. 1670-1900 is one of<br/>&quot;combinative&quot; vs. &quot;chordal&quot; verticality. In the first technique,<br/>multivoice combinations and progressions are built from various<br/>elementary two-voice intervals and progressions, which may be<br/>superimposed or &quot;stacked&quot; (e.g. the M6-8 and M3-5 progressions in the<br/>above example). In the second approach, chords (often derived at least<br/>in theory from stacked thirds) are the &quot;elementary&quot; particles of<br/>motion, with intervals often considered as fragments of such chords.</p><p>Generally, I might guess, in a combinative approach there is a<br/>greater diversity of common vertical progressions than in a chordal<br/>approach, and therefore a large range of musical choices which may<br/>provide pleasing results in both dimensions. In a chordal approach,<br/>the harmonic key structure tends to be a canalizing factor.</p><p>Thus I would say that decisions about unwritten accidentals in<br/>medieval and Renaissance music (either _musica recta_ or _musica<br/>ficta_) are often based on a consideration of both dimensions. In<br/>practice, this might often mean that in ensemble music with one<br/>performer per part, the performers (originally reading most often from<br/>choirbooks or partbooks rather than from scores) on first reading<br/>respond to cues from their own melodic lines. If vertical results<br/>deemed &quot;unpleasant&quot; occur, then the performers make necessary<br/>adjustments.</p><p>In 1529, Pietro Aron (the first known writer to describe the division<br/>of a pure major third into four equally narrowed fifths, the basis for<br/>1/4-comma meantone) added a fascinating supplement to his _Toscanello<br/>in Musica_ focusing on these issues. He argues that while skilled<br/>performers can recognize many places where unwritten accidentals are<br/>called for, there is no performer so skillful as would not now and<br/>then &quot;be caught in a bit of dissonance&quot; before figuring out that an<br/>inflection was needed to avoid such an event.</p><p>In an excellent study on 16th-century intabulations which _do_ show<br/>precisely the semitones required (e.g. on lute) for the arranger&apos;s<br/>version of a piece, Robert Toft shows how vertical and horizontal<br/>factors -- and the varying tastes of musicians -- can lead to<br/>different solutions from different arrangers of the same motet by<br/>Josquin des Prez, for example.</p><p>For more on Toft, and these topics generally, you might visit:</p><p><a href="http://www.medieval.org/emfaq/harmony/hex.html">http://www.medieval.org/emfaq/harmony/hex.html</a></p><p>Anyway, while emphasizing the importance of both dimensions in early<br/>European music, I&apos;d like also to agree with Daniel Wolf&apos;s basic point<br/>that melody is at least as basic as verticality in this mix. Writing<br/>maybe around 1260, Franco of Cologne describes how to compose a<br/>conductus for two, three, or four voices, and starts with this advice:<br/>&quot;Write as beautiful a melody as you can&quot; to serve as the tenor or<br/>foundation of the polyphonic composition. That isn&apos;t a bad starting<br/>point.</p><p>Most appreciatively,</p><p>Margo Schulter<br/><a href="mailto:mschulter@value.net">mschulter@value.net</a></p></div>
