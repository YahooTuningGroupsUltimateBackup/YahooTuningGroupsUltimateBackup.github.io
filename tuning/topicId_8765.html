[TD544:7].  For me, the most striking<br/>aspect of these articles was the fact that musicians *WANTED* variations<br/>between keys, as evidenced in meantone and, purportedly, Werkmeister III.<br/>I had no idea that some of the actual *structural* parts of pieces were<br/>dependent on some of these anomalies.  That sure means we&apos;ve been hearing a<br/>*LOT* of pieces wrong, and for a long time!...  It&apos;s amazing that 12-tET<br/>could ride &quot;roughshod&quot; over all this history... but, perhaps people were<br/>&quot;mesmerized&quot; by the smoothness and functionality, as some of Paul Erlichs<br/>W.
