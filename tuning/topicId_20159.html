I would say that I also find great resonance with you in<br/>&gt;seeing the full cycle of creation come about.

I WOULD NOT CALL MYSELF A<br/>MICROTONALIST (SORRY GUYS AND GUYESSES), IN GENERAL, AS A COMPOSER/MUSICIAN.<br/>MY FOCUS AND CONCERN INCLUDES MICROTONALITY BUT WHAT CONCERNS ME EVEN MORE<br/>IS THE PROCESS OF WORKING AND THE EFFECT THAT THE MUSIC OR SOUND HAS ON THE<br/>TEEMING MICROLAYERS OF ENERGETIC SOUNDS THAT EXIST ON HIGHER LEVELS OF THE<br/>MUSICAL UNIVERSE THAN THE ACOUSTICAL. SO THE CREATIVE AND THE SPIRITUAL ARE<br/>TO ME MORE IMPORTANT STILL.</p><p>&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt; QUESTIONS:<br/>&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt; 1)What is your take on creative work, in particular the process of<br/>&gt;initial<br/>&gt;&gt; ideas/forms leading to your eventual adoption of a direction,<br/>&gt;scale, track<br/>&gt;&gt; or album?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;If I answer this in a literal way, I&apos;d say that my musical concepts<br/>&gt;can originate from a number of points:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;1.  Inspired by the theory behind the particular scale under<br/>&gt;consideration.<br/>&gt;2.  Rhythmic concepts. These days my focus has returned to deeper<br/>&gt;exploration of prime poly-meters.<br/>&gt;3.  Melody, which seems to naturally emanate from a given tuning<br/>&gt;system.<br/>&gt;4.  Harmonies resulting from melodic simultaneities on different<br/>&gt;timbres.<br/>&gt;5.  Timbres alone sometimes inspire the direction of a composition. A<br/>&gt;good example of this is a piece I&apos;m working on now, with bowed gong<br/>&gt;harmonics (will have choir singing in spectra scales).<br/>&gt;6.  Wild flights of musical fantasy and conceptual creation. I always<br/>&gt;liked Zappa&apos;s &quot;conceptual continuity&quot;, and like to conceive of<br/>&gt;unifying concepts for entire suites of compositions.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;If I answer in a less literal way, I have to say that it is entirely<br/>&gt;mysterious how it all fuses into the moment of musical creation.<br/>&gt;Sometimes I feel varying degrees and proportions of influence over<br/>&gt;the direction of compositions and suites, coming from all of the<br/>&gt;above basic elements, but it is the ultimate process of how it is all<br/>&gt;unified into the final act of music creations, which almost seems to<br/>&gt;be going on outside of the control of my conscious mind. I fancy that<br/>&gt;the facet of our consciousness which drives the cycle of musical<br/>&gt;creation through to its final fulfillment, deals little with the<br/>&gt;rational/organizational side. It&apos;s the union of the rational (which<br/>&gt;dutifully performs the &quot;dirty&quot; work in a collaboration toward music),<br/>&gt;and the &quot;non&quot;-rational, which takes blissful flights from the cliffs,<br/>&gt;that makes it all reach the final stages. It&apos;s almost as though there<br/>&gt;are complimentary forces at work within ourselves, and the end<br/>&gt;product of the union of the creative poles is - music.</p><p>WHAT DISTINGUISHES BEING HUMAN FOR ME IS THE MYSTERIOUS PRESENCE INSIDE US,<br/>A GROUNDLESS ROOT OF ACTIVITY. TO MAKE INROADS INTO THIS CAN BE GREATLY<br/>ENHANCED BY TUNING WORK.

The first tunings I ever tried were equal<br/>&gt;temperaments (24, 36, 19, 31), which led to just intonations, then<br/>&gt;NJNE..etc, now spectral temperaments, which are totally dependent<br/>&gt;upon the spectra of the instrumental ensembles used in each<br/>&gt;composition.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;Truthfully, I must say that allot of time-consuming planning on the<br/>&gt;level of tuning theory, and sound design must happen leading up to<br/>&gt;the moment where I can take flight from the cliff tops. But when I<br/>&gt;get to this point; where all is tuned and timbres in place for music<br/>&gt;creation, I proceed largely without preconceptions. This way I allow<br/>&gt;my music making sensibilities to dictate the direction in a way that<br/>&gt;my rational mind (the organizer of the magic moment) would not allow.<br/>&gt;Whatever it is that &quot;takes over&quot; in the moment - that &quot;inner&quot; ear -<br/>&gt;is what seems to reveal the soul of a tuning for me. In a way it&apos;s<br/>&gt;laughable to try to speak about the ineffable experience of how one<br/>&gt;writes a compelling melody, chord progression or complete music<br/>&gt;compositions, but all that it takes before the creation begins<br/>&gt;(theory, sound design, etc), totally takes a back seat when it&apos;s time<br/>&gt;to play and compose. One must call on other forces for this!</p><p>PERHAPS CREATING REINFORCES THE NOTION AND REALITY OF OUR DEEPER<br/>WELLSPRINGS.

How large of a part does improvisation play in your creative<br/>&gt;process,<br/>&gt;&gt; and inform of the qualities of a given tuning system?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;This is a very interesting question - almost as if you were thinking<br/>&gt;my thoughts!  It is hugely important, and it is from this activity<br/>&gt;that the musical nature of scales are revealed for me. For instance,<br/>&gt;in a scenario where I am improvising in a JI scale, I may be<br/>&gt;accompanied by a harmonic drone (similar in sound and purpose to that<br/>&gt;of the tamboura in Indian music), and perhaps a little Bodhran, Tar<br/>&gt;or Riq; and when I place the tuning into this multi-dimensional space<br/>&gt;where the inspiration of rhythmic motion and timbre come into play,<br/>&gt;then it takes on a life and energy all its own.  As above, at this<br/>&gt;point there is &quot;less pre-thought&quot; - all of that has happened leading<br/>&gt;up to the moment of the improvisation and underlies it. When the muse<br/>&gt;speaks though, it is in the language of music and emotions.</p><p>IMPROVISATION IS THE RESERVOIR OF MY CREATIVE MATERIALS. IMPROVISING FOR ME<br/>INVOKES LARGE SLABS OF UNCONSCIOUS IMPRESSIONS AND MELTS THEM LIKE HONEYED<br/>ICEBERGS INTO REFRESHING MUSICAL FEELINGS.<br/>I HAVE HAD THE EXPERIENCE OF THE ATMOSPHERE OF A TUNING SUGGESTING CERTAIN<br/>PROGRESSIONS OR MELODIC CONTOURS.<br/>WHAT WE ARE ALL TRYING TO DO (I WOULD SUBMIT) IS TO REALLY ENGAGE WITH<br/>UPLIFTING ENERGY, THE SENSE OF AWE OF INTERSTELLAR SPACE, TO<br/>STRETCH/RELAX/CONCENTRATE OUR PSYCHIC FOCUS ON LIFE AS WE PREVIOUSLY<br/>APPREHENDED IT.</p><p>&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt; &quot;The Creative spirit of the list?&quot;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;Absolutely!

I realize<br/>that this connotes many things for different folks. For me it<br/>connotes the freedom to use any pitch needed for the musical task at<br/>hand, but I agree that to identify with the Composer/Musician label,<br/>does indeed cover all possibilities, without giving undue weight to<br/>any one dimensional conception. &quot;Microtonalist&quot; is more a kind<br/>of &quot;contextual&quot; word.</p><p>I would agree that the creative and spiritual elements form<br/>foundations, from which greatest music emanates. I see two important<br/>tendencies at work in our time:</p><p>1.    Music can emanate from within the philosophical mindset<br/>of &quot;Western Art Music&quot;, where the focus may be completely based upon<br/>complexity of structures, following &quot;traditions&quot; of compositional<br/>methodologies handed down through Western Academia.</p><p>2.    Music can emanate from what I like to think of as the Ritual<br/>Function, which is an integral part of<br/>personal/communal/tribal/cultural ceremony and ritual. The ideas that<br/>we have today about &quot;Western Art&quot;, and the philosophical reasons for<br/>it, would be completely alien to a traditional society or culture<br/>where music was used for ceremony or ritual and celebration. Concepts<br/>of the exalted Western artists and their egos - or even the<br/>philosophical purpose behind Western Art music - become unusable in a<br/>music which serves its purpose through the ritual of a culture.</p><p>Certainly, both have produced works of great beauty, but many would<br/>likely agree that the musics with these separate purposes, have a<br/>completely different sound and function for the lives of the people<br/>using them.</p><p>&gt; &gt;If I answer in a less literal way, I have to say that it is<br/>entirely<br/>&gt; &gt;mysterious how it all fuses into the moment of musical creation.<br/>&gt; &gt;Sometimes I feel varying degrees and proportions of influence over<br/>&gt; &gt;the direction of compositions and suites, coming from all of the<br/>&gt; &gt;above basic elements, but it is the ultimate process of how it is<br/>all<br/>&gt; &gt;unified into the final act of music creations, which almost seems<br/>to<br/>&gt; &gt;be going on outside of the control of my conscious mind.

Perhaps the experimental periods of extreme cognitive<br/>dissonance and incomprehensible rhythmic structure, ran into<br/>the &quot;brick wall&quot; of the undeniable realities of the &quot;Miller Limit&quot; -<br/>which point to the limits of the human cognitive system being able to<br/>comprehend these complexities. I have been very happy to find others<br/>here who wish to take all this to heart in the philosophy of their<br/>creative work. I can make no apologies about the fact that I enjoy<br/>listening to and making simple melodic musics. I think that this<br/>allows microtonal subtleties to be perceived better, and is less<br/>alienating to the listener.</p><p>&gt; A GOOD TEST OF CREATIVE POTENCY TO ME IS THE NUMBER OF GOOD NEW<br/>BRANCHING<br/>&gt; POSSIBILITIES THAT ARE OPENED UP.</p><p>It is a branching - like a fractal growth of creative energies being<br/>fed from many sources.</p><p>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt; (Through playing music (on Turkish) for Sufi meditation groups<br/>in<br/>&gt; &gt;the mid<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt; 70s, it has seemed to me from that point very possible to create<br/>&gt; &gt;with much<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt; less pre-thought).<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt; 3.

Today there is a<br/>balance between the two. And as subjective as I know it is to say<br/>this; I have found that certain musics - for me - can be extremely<br/>unsettling to listen to; even having the capability of making me feel<br/>a little physically ill. It is something that my body seems to<br/>reject. Don&apos;t know how else to explain it - but I approach any music<br/>with a totally open mind; without preconceptions, and I actively<br/>listen to and play myriad of styles of music.</p><p>I realize that is so subjective, but I feel more and more compelled<br/>these days to listen to what my &quot;inner ear&quot; tells me. It&apos;s a &quot;body&quot;<br/>thing, and very difficult to explain. It all leads to the questions<br/>and points I address (clarification prompted by your reply) in my<br/>above clarification - that of enduring qualities of music, which I&apos;m<br/>hyper-sensitive about being a very personal and subjective reality<br/>for any individual composer. As one could easily infer from my<br/>clarification on this topic, I would never denigrate anyone else&apos;s<br/>perspective, because I know theirs is as important to them as mine is<br/>to me. Strangely though, I find on some levels that there is much<br/>common ground about these things, which I see all the time coming<br/>forward from my interactions with composers around the world. I do<br/>see that others listen to their inner voices and their body for<br/>signals about music which is correct for their unique and individual<br/>purposes.</p><p>Sorry for the confusion I may have caused with my too short<br/>statements. I&apos;m at my worst level of communication when I&apos;m trying to<br/>kick out a post within the constraints of a 10 minute tea break on my<br/>job.</p><p>Thanks,</p><p>Jacky Ligon</p></div><h3><a id=20274 href="#20274">ðŸ”—</a>Afmmjr@aol.com</h3><span>3/17/2001 7:28:06 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Hi Jacky,</p><p>Isn&apos;t the relistenability of music sort of like finding the fountain of<br/>youth?  This is one of the toughest questions ever posted to the list.  Of<br/>course, as individuals, it&apos;s all great fun.</p><p>Bach did not think of success after death.  An earlier relative, Michael<br/>Bach, wrote anonymously, regularly.  And Kraig Grady makes an interesting<br/>point, that there are more people living today than all those who came before<br/>us, indicating little need for longevity.  Mozart is said to be relistenable<br/>because his music is said to have layers of meaning, allowing a listener one<br/>layer, and then another, with different points of entry.</p><p>As I get older, I find my tastes do change.  I like to eat foods that I never<br/>had in youth.  Some pieces are more visceral and the &quot;feel&quot; is worth<br/>reemission.  Sometimes a piece reminds us of something extra-musical (like a<br/>lover).  The fact of being a composer makes one visit other people&apos;s music<br/>less often, anecdotally submitted.  Wouldn&apos;t any composer like their own<br/>original music more than that of most any other?  I think so.</p><p>Style is a major motivation for the great majorities.  But I am swayed<br/>differently.  I do like most any style of music, if only out of respect of<br/>the people who created it.  There is always at least one great piece of music<br/>in any style.  And any single great piece makes a great composer, as a great<br/>novelist needs only one great book.</p><p>A Player of music may have different interests than a Dancer.  Acoustics are<br/>more sensual to me than electronic.  Listening to electronic for me was once<br/>like reading in another language, loaded with cognates.  Volume and dynamic<br/>distinguishment is all-important....balance, balance, balance.  But that&apos;s<br/>because I produce and direct concerts.  Most people have great difficulty<br/>with balance.  I want every sound playing to be heard.  There are pockets of<br/>space that can be filled up with different timbres.  They needn&apos;t clash or<br/>drown each other out.  (Just like those on this list.)</p><p>Sorry if I opt out of giving an actual list.  I have a fairly large<br/>collection, LPs, CDs, tapes, etc.   But playing live is always the strongest<br/>memory in my head.  Listening live is the next strongest lasting impression.<br/>I can&apos;t listen to Beethoven anymore, it&apos;s been pounded into me.  No, I don&apos;t<br/>listen to Mozart much, either...been through the layers.  Still love Bach,<br/>partly because I am hearing more and more in his music, more than people<br/>heard in his own time (because there were no recordings).</p><p>Music of other cultures is the most vitalizing aspect of listening for me.<br/>It&apos;s like traveling, and I love traveling to different places.  Too bad we<br/>have industry pointed in the wrong direction right now.  All money makes<br/>money, it seems.  But not for me.</p><p>Johnny Reinhard</p></div><h3><a id=20287 href="#20287">ðŸ”—</a>monz &#x3C;MONZ@JUNO.COM&#x3E;</h3><span>3/17/2001 11:37:26 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In tuning@y..., ligonj@n... wrote:</p><p><a href="/tuning/topicId_20159.html#20273">/tuning/topicId_20159.html#20273</a></p><p>&gt; --- In tuning@y..., &quot;D.Stearns&quot; &lt;STEARNS@C...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; Hi Jacky,<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; There&apos;s a lot of music -- Ives, Fela and PE come right to<br/>&gt; &gt; my mind -- where the music could definitely be said to come<br/>&gt; &gt; from a &quot;shock value aesthetic&quot; that&apos;s also (to my mind)<br/>&gt; &gt; music of genius as well as music of commitment.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Dan,<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Yes - it&apos;s all subjective.

An artist like PE might well produce works<br/>that can be taken seriously as art while also infusing them with shock value.  It takes a bit of<br/>shock to break through the jaded atmosphere of certain subcultures.  But there are many more<br/>self-styled artists whose sole value is shock.  And that&apos;s certainly no lasting value at all,<br/>merely novelty and hype.</p><p>A strange sounding tuning might briefly arrest the listener&apos;s ear.  But if that&apos;s all the tuning is<br/>used for, as a flashing neon light, the composer has done no service to the tuning community nor to<br/>humanity.</p><p>&gt; I feel compelled to reveal to the List what I&apos;ve been listening<br/>&gt; to and had buzzing around my head all week.</p><p>&gt; Englebert Humperdinck.</p><p>That&apos;s comical!  I suppose you&apos;ll join me in humming BeeGees tunes for the next few days 8-)&gt;</p><p>Seriously, while that does relate to what Dan said about 70&apos;s pop hits still being moving for him,<br/>it&apos;s a separate issue from their having a lasting appeal to humanity generally - say, the way J. S.<br/>Bach&apos;s music is now so popular in Japan.  I think that the response, &quot;Yeah, but it&apos;s meaningful to<br/>me&quot; fails to support the argument that it is a piece of &quot;lasting music&quot; in the same sense.</p><p>Only time will tell, of course.  But it seems unlikely that future generations will take<br/>Humperdinck&apos;s hits as seriously as Beethoven&apos;s symphonies.  Just as they will not likely place a<br/>photo of Karen Findley&apos;s chocolate-smeared body next to Michaelangelo&apos;s David.  Not unless they<br/>need a good laugh, in the vein of 3rd grade humor.</p><p>The classics are not determined arbitrarily.  The evidence for the existence of Eternal Principle -<br/>of that which is intrinsically noble - circumstantial though it be, looks overwhelming to me.
