You know that 12-equal, 19-equal, 31-equal, 50-equal and so on belong to the meantone family?  The &quot;pivot&quot; is an equal (in the simple case) temperament that belongs to two different families.  I think that&apos;s an intuitive and precise definition.</p><p>The question is whether 31-equal is a pivot between meantone and 7&amp;31 (Vicentino&apos;s neutral thirds/enharmonic meantone, which has a distinct mapping in higher limits).  The difference is that they don&apos;t have the same generator.</p><p>Also, what about 12&amp;29 schismic (garibaldi) and this 12&amp;7 &quot;dominant&quot; meantone.  They both work with fifths sharp of 12-equal, so can 12 really be called the pivot between them?  Well, by analogy with levers it can.  It&apos;s called a second or third class lever here:</p><p><a href="http://www.enchantedlearning.com/physics/machines/Levers.shtml">http://www.enchantedlearning.com/physics/machines/Levers.shtml</a></p><p>&gt; Graham defined &quot;pivot-ET&quot; specifically as the<br/>&gt; boundary between two families of linear temperaments<br/>&gt; ... but i suspect that perhaps now he would make<br/>&gt; that more general.</p><p>It can certainly be made more general.  That&apos;s why I specified &quot;pivot-ET&quot;, so that &quot;pivot&quot; can be used in other contexts.</p><p>&gt; if he does want the specific meaning, then &quot;node&quot;<br/>&gt; is more general as it describes the origin-points<br/>&gt; of *all* branches on the temperament family-tree.<br/>&gt; &gt; so &quot;node&quot; defines not only boundaries between families<br/>&gt; of temperaments, but also all the relations between<br/>&gt; different family members belonging to the same family tree.</p><p>I&apos;m still not sure what &quot;family&quot; means.  The definition page seems inconsistent.  You talk about ETs, Gene talks about LTs, and there&apos;s no overview.
