Pardon my ignorance, but I don&apos;t<br/>understand, unless it&apos;s voice leading considerations (?), but the minor 7th<br/>in the Dmin7 chord is in tune at 9/5.  There&apos;st more stuff on the web I<br/>should read  before asking more inane questions in this direction, but all<br/>suggestions of good reading on why certain ratios are best in one chord and<br/>not another would be most welcome.</p><p>&gt;&gt;Comments?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;Get yourself some singers. Or, take a look at <a href="http://www.justonic.com">www.justonic.com</a> for some<br/>&gt;software that I think might do what you want.</p><p>Unfortunately Justonic won&apos;t integrate into my system at all (doesn&apos;t<br/>support my synths, runs on a different platform than my sequencer, etc.),<br/>otherwise I&apos;ld experiment with it.</p><p>But my biggest interest is to understand whatever theory there is behind<br/>tuning, at least as far as there are physical reasons for some things<br/>sounding good and others sounding like they should change soon - up to the<br/>point where it turns into individual aesthetics, cultures, etc. (which I&apos;m<br/>getting the impression happens fairly quickly :)).  All references greatly<br/>welcomed (I&apos;ve got lots of URLs from this group and searching the web,  but<br/>if anybody has compiled a list that would be great).</p><p>I&apos;m also aware of Sethares work relating tuning to timbre etc., but would be<br/>very interested in any scales people have derived from acoustical<br/>instruments and voice using this technique.   (His book is out of print, so<br/>I don&apos;t know if he has much of this in it.)</p><p>Thanks to all respondents for the helpful answers.  I appreciate it.</p></div>
