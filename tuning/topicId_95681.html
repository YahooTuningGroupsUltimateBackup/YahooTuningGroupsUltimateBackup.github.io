And it is...it&apos;s not some random effect...it keeps all sweeps<br/>(filter/stutter/pan/beat offsets...) exactly on rhythm musically (IE a stutter<br/>would align to, say, a 128th note or triplet or quantized rhythm at the<br/>specified tempo, and not some random interval in between)!.  It&apos;s all coming<br/>from BT, who has the world record for most edits in a song in &quot;Simply Being<br/>Loved&quot;, and it actually sounds just as convincing as one of the parts from that<br/>song...without the pain and agony of performing over 3000 edits!</p></div>
