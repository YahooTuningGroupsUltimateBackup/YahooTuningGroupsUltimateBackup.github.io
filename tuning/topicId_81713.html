I do get some coincidences with &quot;harmonic entropy&quot; as known on these lists. However, a &quot;universal&quot; dissonance curve can&apos;t exist, because spectra vary. Obviously there is going to be less clash with a particular partial if that partial simply isn&apos;t there, and a lot more dissonance if there are relatively high-amplitude partials clashing in some particularly sensitive range.</p><p>If harmonic entropy charts were published adressing the spectra of some classic &quot;general purpose&quot; waveforms, say saw, triangle, and 1/2 and 1/3 duty cycle pulses, it would be more attractive to more people I suspect. This would be more fun for the guys anyway, I&apos;d think, because for one thing you&apos;d have to figure out a way of dropping specific primes from the reckoning.</p><p>&gt; &nbsp; And, oddly enough, it appears some of the results you get match &gt;JI.</p><p>Since my whole approach to tuning is based on the ear and singing, there&apos;s probably no way I&apos;m ever really going to know if what I&apos;m hearing is, for example, a 17/13 or the golden section of the frequency between 5/4 and 4/3, or a point of &quot;maximum HE&quot;, as they&apos;re all within a couple of cents. It does matter as far as the color of the tuning as a whole, though, but I just apply Occam&apos;s razor: if I monkey all morning with my tunable oscillator and singing, and get a bunch of stuff within a couple of cents of 16/13, 17/13, and 18/13, it&apos;s pretty obvious what&apos;s going on and it&apos;s sensible to build a tuning from there. But if 16/13 and 13/8 sound wrong with an alleged 17/13, but 833 cents sounds great, then I go from there.</p><p>&gt;<br/>&gt; &nbsp;&nbsp; But, one thing is for sure...if you are using the formula<br/>&gt;   Noble_Mediant(i/j, m/n)=<br/>&gt;     (i + Phi * m) / (j + Phi * n)<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;   To generate your scale...you are going to get something<br/>&gt; dramatically different than what I get from my<br/>&gt; formula for my tuning<br/>&gt; IE<br/>&gt; result = (PHI^Y) / (2^X)<br/>&gt; where result &gt; 0 and result &lt; PHI^2 and y is<br/>&gt; between 0 and 15.<br/>&gt;   In fact, my version does not even do anything<br/>&gt; relative to fractions that represent the peaks<br/>&gt; and plateaus of the &quot;harmonic entropy&quot; curve.<br/>&gt; -------------------------------------------</p><p>Well, the first interval that pops up after phi in your phi-generator/octave-period tuning is in a region of &quot;maximum harmonic entropy&quot;<br/>so who knows? And regardless of HE says, I think 833 cents is definitely in a region of maximum &quot;otherness&quot;.</p><p>&gt;   This is one thing I&apos;m finding very confusing about<br/>&gt; your other PHI tunings...many of them are based on<br/>&gt; formulas that have more to do with deriving from<br/>&gt; things like whole numbered fractions multiplied by<br/>&gt; PHI in some form...than taking a simple incrementing variable<br/>&gt; times PHI itself.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;    So, on the surface, it seems my tuning (at least mathematically)<br/>&gt; has more to do with PHI while yours has to do more with<br/>&gt; &quot;using PHI do find areas of harmonic entropy relative to something<br/>&gt; else&quot;.<br/>&gt; ---------------------------<br/>&gt;   This difference in use of PHI as a generator potentially means<br/>&gt; there are several PHI tunings that look and<br/>&gt; sound nothing like each other.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;   If these papers (all the ones I&apos;ve read on PHI tunings)<br/>&gt; are right...there&apos;s is no such thing as a standard<br/>&gt; PHI tuning.

They measure two subtly different properties. Sethares&apos; curves, and others of that nature, measure a perceptual kind of dissonance, or &quot;roughness&quot; as you might call it, caused by actual clashes between partials. As such, they do vary depending on timbre and register. Harmonic entropy deals with more abstract properties of intervals, such as whether an interval is distinct enough to have its own character or sounds more like a simpler interval that&apos;s detuned. While it&apos;s true that the local minima of the harmonic entropy curves tend to be the more consonant intervals, the intervals at the local maxima have their own character that isn&apos;t drawn strongly in one direction or the other (you could call it an &quot;ambiguous&quot; character).</p><p>&gt;&gt; ******************************************************** ----Since<br/>&gt;&gt; my whole approach to tuning is based on the ear and &gt;singing, &gt;&gt; there&apos;s probably no ----way I&apos;m ever really going to know if what<br/>&gt;&gt; &gt;I&apos;m hearing is, for example, a 17/13 or the golden ----section of<br/>&gt;&gt; the &gt;frequency between 5/4 and 4/3, or a point of &quot;maximum HE&quot;, as<br/>&gt;&gt; they&apos;re all ----&gt;within a couple of cents.

The question is whether consonance/dissonance, taken out of harmonic context, are really adequate concepts to describe musical harmony. Since there are an infinite number of ratios we could consider, my fear is that without some guide from existing musical practice we could waste entire lifetimes chasing rabbits down the hole and being none the wiser for it.</p><p>-Rick</p></div><h3><a id=82130 href="#82130">ðŸ”—</a>Michael Sheiman &#x3C;djtrancendance@...&#x3E;</h3><span>3/9/2009 10:29:30 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Rick,</p><p>--That&apos;s why the whole PHI-tonality seems so appealing to me...in such --a tuning the notes all have the exact same relationship to each --other and thus multiple notes can be &quot;roots&quot; simultaneously. ..and --thus I suspect the &quot;average feel&quot; of the relationships between the --notes could over-ride the need to be &quot;consonant about a single --root&quot;.<br/>&gt; This is what I&apos;ve called &quot;floating&quot;.

What I mean is one of those seemingly trivial points but which is more problematic than it appears. As you know, frequency can be equally defined as A) inverse of period or B) number of cycles per second. It is often assumed that a cycle means that of a sine wave + its upper harmonics, but in reality it only requires that two or more waves have a rational relation. The resultant frequency will be the greatest common divisor (GCD) eg two sine waves of 6Hz and 9Hz will &apos;add&apos; to give a freq of 3Hz, the wave repeating after every 1/3rd second. Observe that 6 and 9 are the 2nd and 3rd harmonics of 3. Because 9/6 = 3/2 and factor out, we could always choose phi or any number we please as the freq i.e. 6 x phi and 9 x phi, produce a fundamental 3 x phi. However, if we take 6 and phi together, then they do not have a GCD.</p><p>So when you make the self evident point &quot;can the distance between two frequencies be irrational - certainly&quot;, I ask &quot;what do you really mean by frequency here?&quot;. And even more to the point, if we &apos;add&apos; those two waves together, since they bear an irrational relation, then there is no GCD and therefore no &apos;frequency&apos; in the manner just defined.</p><p>I hope that makes it a bit clearer (cause I&apos;m very hung over)</p><p>-Rick</p></div><h3><a id=82156 href="#82156">ðŸ”—</a>rick_ballan &#x3C;rick_ballan@...&#x3E;</h3><span>3/14/2009 7:37:21 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, Michael Sheiman &lt;djtrancendance@...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; --the very concept of frequency itself relies on the GCD between rational<br/>&gt; numbers,<br/>&gt; Huh?

Try playing the 10TET tuning.  It sounds terribly dissonant, yet is very evenly spaced.

And I have listened to the site and already said that it sounds out of tune. What does the term &apos;alternate&apos; mean in this &apos;alternate tuning&apos; site, alternative to what? It is alternatives to the harmonic series, 12 edo, meantone, in short all of those systems which experience has taught us to trust. And how can we find valid options if we do not understand the benefits and downfalls of those systems and take them as our starting point?</p><p>&quot;--the very concept of frequency itself relies on the GCD between rational numbers, Huh?  Sounds more like the concept of the harmonic series to me...---and beat &apos;frequencies&apos; are a secondary concept.<br/>Beating is IF you are modeling you scales after the harmonic series.&quot;</p><p>Well it is called the &quot;harmonic&quot; series for a reason. It is a natural phenomenon which occurs whenever we pluck a stretched string or blow air through a pipe. Its discovery dates back to the very beginnings of science with Pythagoras (570 B.C.). Without this spiritual aspect of &quot;harmonia&quot;, which meant universal order, mathematics probably would have remained a form of accounting.</p><p>The difference b/w the harmonic series and the GCD is that we can play upper harmonics on two different instruments and create a new fundamental frequency which is not played on the original two. This phenomenon realises itself as the key and is called tonality.<br/>And no, beating is independent of the harmonic series. It is half the difference b/w ANY two frequencies. It dissappears when two strings (say) are in tune because the beat freq becomes an harmonic.</p><p>You also said that you tried 10 tet and it sounded out of tune. But nobody has ever claimed (especially not Bill) that all equal distributions will be the same or that disproving one will automatically discount all the others. Again, the 12 tet and meantone systems evolved out of attempting to distribute the harmonic series over all keys. We find similar types of tunings in other cultures such as the 7 (??) tet of Turkish music.</p><p>Finally, I&apos;ll ask you for the last time how can you explain PHI musically? Given (a + b)/a = a/b, which gives a quadratic equation the solution of which is PHI, then what is the possible meaning of the addition of a + b? It is twice the average freq, which means that it is an octave above. So we have :the octave of the average freq divided by the larger freq equals the ratio b/w the two freq&apos;s.

This means that, theoretically speaking at least, no two cycles will ever repeat and an irrational wave will never repeat itself all the way to infinity.</p><p>&gt;</p><p>&gt; &gt;</p><p>&gt;</p><p>&gt; &gt;</p><p>&gt;</p><p>&gt; &gt;</p><p>&gt;</p><p>&gt; &gt; Now add to this the fact that there are an uncountably infinite number of these waves (aleph 1, see Georg Cantor), that this number is so large compared with countable infinity (aleph 0, the amount of rational numbers) that if we threw a dart on a number line the odds of hitting a rational is so small as to be practically zero. The rational numbers and musical harmony become like a precious and rare gem in the midst of a universe of chaos. This is what I had at the back of my mind when writing the rabbit hole. But I was wrong saying we&apos;d be none the wiser for it, for exploring things like phi etc...I have regained a new appreciation of rational harmony.</p><p>&gt;</p><p>&gt; &gt;</p><p>&gt;</p><p>&gt; &gt;</p><p>&gt;</p><p>&gt; &gt;</p><p>&gt;</p><p>&gt; &gt; -Rick</p><p>&gt;</p><p>&gt; &gt;</p><p>&gt;</p><p>&gt; Michael,</p><p>&gt;</p><p>&gt;</p><p>&gt;</p><p>&gt; Firstly, the 12 tone system is already irrational. The difference is that it evolved using the rational numbers as a guide, trying to distribute them evenly over each key. True, they might be almost periodic, or they might be harmonics in the higher octaves e.g. 645/512 = 1.2597... is a very good approximation to the tempered maj 3, 2 power of 1/3 = 1.25992.... So I am not against irrationals per se, which would be absurd, but am merely bringing certain &apos;awkward&apos; points into the open.</p><p>&gt;</p><p>&gt;</p><p>&gt;</p><p>&gt; Secondly, the example you gave of beating are not irrational numbers but whole numbers i.e. 122-100Hz = 22Hz etc so I haven&apos;t got a clue what you mean here. But as I have also pointed out many times in this group, the very concept of frequency itself relies on the GCD between rational numbers, which is also a model of musical harmony, and beat &apos;frequencies&apos; are a secondary concept. To use your example, 122/100 = 61/50, therefore GCD = 2, 100 and 122 are the 50th and 61st harmonics of tonic 2, and the beat freq (btw, half the difference) is 1/2(122-100) = 11 and therefore is the 11th harmonic.</p><p>&gt;</p><p>&gt;</p><p>&gt;</p><p>&gt; -Rick</p><p>Michael,</p><p>I keep on going on about it to you because you keep on missing the point. And I have listened to the site and already said that it sounds out of tune. What does the term &apos;alternate&apos; mean in this &apos;alternate tuning&apos; site, alternative to what? It is alternatives to the harmonic series, 12 edo, meantone, in short all of those systems which experience has taught us to trust. And how can we find valid options if we do not understand the benefits and downfalls of those systems and take them as our starting point?</p><p>&quot;--the very concept of frequency itself relies on the GCD between rational numbers, Huh?  Sounds more like the concept of the harmonic series to me...---and beat &apos;frequencies&apos; are a secondary concept.</p><p>Beating is IF you are modeling you scales after the harmonic series.&quot;</p><p>Well it is called the &quot;harmonic&quot; series for a reason. It is a natural phenomenon which occurs whenever we pluck a stretched string or blow air through a pipe. Its discovery dates back to the very beginnings of science with Pythagoras (570 B.C.). Without this spiritual aspect of &quot;harmonia&quot;, which meant universal order, mathematics probably would have remained a form of accounting.</p><p>The difference b/w the harmonic series and the GCD is that we can play upper harmonics on two different instruments and create a new fundamental frequency which is not played on the original two. This phenomenon realises itself as the key and is called tonality.</p><p>And no, beating is independent of the harmonic series. It is half the difference b/w ANY two frequencies. It dissappears when two strings (say) are in tune because the beat freq becomes an harmonic.</p><p>You also said that you tried 10 tet and it sounded out of tune. But nobody has ever claimed (especially not Bill) that all equal distributions will be the same or that disproving one will automatically discount all the others. Again, the 12 tet and meantone systems evolved out of attempting to distribute the harmonic series over all keys. We find similar types of tunings in other cultures such as the 7 (??) tet of Turkish music.</p><p>Finally, I&apos;ll ask you for the last time how can you explain PHI musically? Given (a + b)/a = a/b, which gives a quadratic equation the solution of which is PHI, then what is the possible meaning of the addition of a + b? It is twice the average freq, which means that it is an octave above. So we have :the octave of the average freq divided by the larger freq equals the ratio b/w the two freq&apos;s. What are we achieving here?</p><p>-Rick</p><p>&gt;</p></div><h3><a id=82166 href="#82166">ðŸ”—</a>rick_ballan &#x3C;rick_ballan@...&#x3E;</h3><span>3/15/2009 8:47:37 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, djtrancendance@... wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; --I keep on going on about it to you because you keep on missing the<br/>&gt; point.

It is a fact of wave theory and Fourier analysis. It will apply whenever you generate sounds via any method whatsoever. In fact in the early 90&apos;s I worked closely with a scientist named Tony Childs who worked for the company which invented many of the programs you take for granted. My point has been that the traditional beating/consonance type approach which made popular by for eg Helmholtz deals with + and - actually misses the point of harmony, which is ratio based (division, multiplication). As a jazz musician, I use &apos;dissonances&apos; all the time and yet it is still in tune. Similarly, I find Bill&apos;s music quite beautiful and have told him so many times. And in fact Bill&apos;s idea that certain timbres (which is still based on harmonics) fit with certain tuning systems fits well with the fact that a single note already brings with it it own tuning system (for notes are also chords, the idea of a single note besides a single sine wave being an illusion).</p><p>&quot;Yes, they (12 tet/meantone) work, but it surely is not the only way toward easily listen-able music, just the most obvious (both in nature and in the ease of calculating how to make real-world/non-electronic instruments that match it).&quot; But as Sherlock Holmes said, &quot;Watson, everything is obvious upon explanation&quot;. And in fact there is nothing obvious or easy about them, as there is nothing obvious or easy about Bill&apos;s work (which you don&apos;t understand either). eg the term &quot;12 tet system&quot; itself can be a bit reductionist. It includes 6, 4, 3 and 2 tets as subsets, therefore giving the only equal intervals, triads or 4 note chords. It can be seen as equal 4ths over 5 8ve&apos;s, equal 5th&apos;s over 7 8ve&apos;s, and closer to the actual practice of 12 tet music, successive minor and major thirds and vice-versa. But to describe the model exactly, we would have to describe the study of jazz/classical musical harmony which is a lifetime pursuit. In other words, it is much, much more difficult than simply downloading scalar and reading a few articles on micro-tuning and then imagining that you are at the cutting-edge of the &quot;neuveax open-minded&quot;.</p><p>-Rick</p></div><h3><a id=82167 href="#82167">ðŸ”—</a>djtrancendance@...</h3><span>3/16/2009 8:07:41 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--The GCD frequency isn&apos;t restricted to acoustic instruments.

In fact in the early 90&apos;s I worked closely with a scientist named Tony Childs who worked for the company which invented many of the programs you take for granted. My point has been that the traditional beating/consonance type approach which made popular by for eg Helmholtz deals with + and - actually misses the point of harmony, which is ratio based (division, multiplication) . As a jazz musician, I use &apos;dissonances&apos; all the time and yet it is still in tune. Similarly, I find Bill&apos;s music quite beautiful and have told him so many times. And in fact Bill&apos;s idea that certain timbres (which is still based on harmonics) fit with certain tuning systems fits well with the fact that a single note already brings with it it own tuning system (for notes are also chords, the idea of a<br/> single note besides a single sine wave being an illusion).</p><p>&quot;Yes, they (12 tet/meantone) work, but it surely is not the only way toward easily listen-able music, just the most obvious (both in nature and in the ease of calculating how to make real-world/non- electronic instruments that match it).&quot; But as Sherlock Holmes said, &quot;Watson, everything is obvious upon explanation&quot; . And in fact there is nothing obvious or easy about them, as there is nothing obvious or easy about Bill&apos;s work (which you don&apos;t understand either). eg the term &quot;12 tet system&quot; itself can be a bit reductionist. It includes 6, 4, 3 and 2 tets as subsets, therefore giving the only equal intervals, triads or 4 note chords. It can be seen as equal 4ths over 5 8ve&apos;s, equal 5th&apos;s over 7 8ve&apos;s, and closer to the actual practice of 12 tet music, successive minor and major thirds and vice-versa. But to describe the model exactly, we would have to describe the study of jazz/classical musical harmony which is a lifetime pursuit. In other words, it is<br/> much, much more difficult than simply downloading scalar and reading a few articles on micro-tuning and then imagining that you are at the cutting-edge of the &quot;neuveax open-minded&quot; .</p><p>-Rick</p></div>
