(i.e. the whole point of JI seems<br/>&gt; &gt; to be to be able to have vertical sonorities that are<br/>&gt; &gt; otonal/utonal, preferably lower on the series).<br/>&gt;</p><p>Joe Pehrson:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;Hasn&apos;t a lot of the latticing been TETRADIC in nature, using the 7th<br/>&gt;partial as the THIRD dimension, going off the page??<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;Or, am I misunderstanding something....<br/>&gt;</p><p>Actually, I should have said, instead of triads, any sonorities using<br/>immediate combinations of the lower overtonal collections.  I.e. derived<br/>out of 1 3 5 7 9 or combinations of these.</p><p>It seems that initially, the point of JI is to get perfectly in tune<br/>triads (or 1 3 5 7 tetrads, or 1 3 5 7 9 pentads, or 1 3 5 7 9 11 hexads).<br/>Overtone segments.</p><p>With set theory, the idea is you could make a piece out of any collection,<br/>using is as an Ur-scale, or chord or sonority.  So I Was wondering about<br/>the same thing in JI.</p><p>I did think of one example:  A year ago or so, Dan Stearns posted about<br/>doing a 1-b3-#3-5  (that&apos;s in diatonic scale degree notation) tetrads,<br/>getting it to happen with JI lattices.</p><p>i.e.<br/>               15/8<br/>              /    \<br/>       7/4   /      \<br/>          | /        \<br/>           &grave;3/2-----9/8</p><p>( eg   G-A#-B-D  )</p><p>or something.</p><p>Another idea might be basing a piece on</p><p>                  7/4<br/>                  /<br/>                 /<br/>               7/5<br/>         5/4_-<br/>         /<br/>        /<br/>     1/1</p><p>(C-E-F#-A#)</p><p>(Did I &quot;lattice&quot; that correctly?  That would ROCK MY WORLD!!)  :)</p><p>Neither are immediately derivable directly from the overtone series.<br/>(i.e.  some of the fractions aren&apos;t divisible by 2).  (well, the first is,<br/>but you have to go higher than 13 . .)</p><p>This is the kind of thing I&apos;m talking about.</p><p>But I guess CPS&apos;s do get at this sort of thing.</p><p>***From:  Christopher Bailey******************</p><p><a href="http://music.columbia.edu/~chris">http://music.columbia.edu/~chris</a></p><p>**********************************************</p></div><h3><a id=24336 href="#24336">ðŸ”—</a>Paul Erlich &#x3C;paul@stretch-music.com&#x3E;</h3><span>6/3/2001 8:59:31 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In tuning@y..., Christopher<br/>Bailey &lt;cb202@c...&gt; wrote:</p><p>&gt; This is the kind of thing I&apos;m talking about.</p><p>It&apos;s very similar to what I&apos;m<br/>getting at with Joseph Pehrson.<br/>I&apos;ve shown him two things in<br/>Blackjack so far: how to find the<br/>7-limit tetrads in the lattice, and<br/>how to find many more different<br/>kinds of chords on the keyboard. I<br/>was planning to proceed by<br/>showing Joseph what shapes a<br/>lot of the other chords make on<br/>the lattice, introducing Graham<br/>Breed&apos;s lattice (perhaps) when<br/>dealing with 11-limit sonorities.</p><p>&gt;<br/>&gt; But I guess CPS&apos;s do get at this sort of thing.</p><p>Or just about any other sizable<br/>chunk of the lattice, whether<br/>finite as in JI, or infinite as in a<br/>temperament.</p></div>
