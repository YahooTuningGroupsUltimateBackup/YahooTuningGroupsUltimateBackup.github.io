It comes with a box that has<br/>pedal and breath controller inputs so you can control volume with a<br/>pedal or BC while you control the pitch with the ribbon.</p><p>Paolo</p></div><h3>Microtonal &#x3C;microtonal@worldnet.att.net&#x3E;</h3><span>8/29/2000 8:11:33 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>&gt; Message: 20<br/>&gt;    Date: Tue, 29 Aug 2000 13:13:22 -0700<br/>&gt;    From: Rick McGowan &lt;<a href="mailto:rmcgowan@apple.com">rmcgowan@apple.com</a>&gt;<br/>&gt; Subject: ribbon controller?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Does anyone know any source for a &quot;ribbon controller&quot; or other<br/>fingerboard-like or keyboard-like &gt; continuous controller that can connect<br/>directly to MIDI and produce note-on/note-off plus &quot;pitch bend&quot; messages?<br/>I&apos;m looking for something with &quot;more tactile feedback than a theremin&quot; for<br/>producing continuous pitch... and would need/want to plug it to either<br/>general MIDI or Yamaha TX81Z instruments.<br/>&gt;</p><p>Sorry, there isn&apos;t anything.  Kurzweil sells the Expressionmate MIDI ribbon<br/>controller, however, it cannot generate note-on/note-off simultaneously with<br/>pitch bends.  You have to define one portion of the ribbon to generate<br/>notes, then define another portion to generate pitch bends, if that is<br/>acceptable.</p><p>John Loffink<br/><a href="mailto:microtonal@worldnet.att.net">microtonal@worldnet.att.net</a><br/>The Microtonal Synthesis Web Site<br/><a href="http://home.att.net/~microtonal">http://home.att.net/~microtonal</a></p></div><h3>Jacky Ligon &#x3C;jacky_ekstasis@yahoo.com&#x3E;</h3><span>8/30/2000 1:27:31 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Rick,</p><p>Hello!</p><p>I almost forgot to mention to you that there is a fairly new and<br/>interesting product from Korg called the &quot;KAOSS Pad&quot;, which allows<br/>you to route a number of simultaneous realtime controllers to a<br/>module at once and control it all with you finger tips on this small<br/>pad that you slide about on. It looks really cool. Seen them for<br/>around $250.00. The only thing I&apos;m unsure about is if it generates<br/>midi-note ons or not. I&apos;d like to get one of these myself - I love<br/>using unusual controllers - I&apos;ve been a Midi Wind Synthesist for many<br/>years. One of my fantasy midi controllers is the Mallet Kat - if only<br/>money were no object!</p><p>Take care,</p><p>Jacky</p><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@egroups.com">tuning@egroups.com</a>, Rick McGowan &lt;rmcgowan@a...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt; Does anyone know any source for a &quot;ribbon controller&quot; or other<br/>fingerboard-like or keyboard-like continuous controller that can<br/>connect directly to MIDI and produce note-on/note-off plus &quot;pitch<br/>bend&quot; messages?
