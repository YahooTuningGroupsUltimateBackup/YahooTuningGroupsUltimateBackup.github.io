Any assistence<br/>&gt; either in finding a source, or a more appropriate list would be<br/>&gt; helpful.</p><p>I guess you are referring to the &quot;quartertone tuned&quot; accordions used<br/>in some middle eastern and east european styles. They are really just<br/>regular 12-tone accordions where some notes have been retuned by<br/>filing the reeds, lowering them by a quartertone.</p><p>Basically any accordion tuner could do this, as long as you know which<br/>notes to change. I am not sure myself which notes they detune, so i<br/>can not specify exactly. Also, they might only retune some of the<br/>registers, keeping some in &quot;straight&quot; 12-tet for use in different tunes.</p><p>As for accordions especially made for microtonal tunings, there aren&apos;t<br/>any that i know of. Which is a shame, cause the button accordion<br/>concept has great potential for being expanded to a full microtonal<br/>system-with a truly generalized keyboard. It would be possible to<br/>construct one with the right resources, which is also what i am<br/>planning to do some day.</p><p>&gt; Evan Stuckless</p><p>/Mats &Ouml;ljare</p><p>New site coming soon!</p></div><h3><a id=37930 href="#37930">ðŸ”—</a>gdsecor &#x3C;gdsecor@yahoo.com&#x3E;</h3><span>6/19/2002 10:30:46 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In tuning@y..., &quot;oljare&quot; &lt;oljare@h...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt; ...

This<br/>is not the &quot;bassetti&quot; (a type of generalized) free bass system that<br/>is found in both the U.S. and Europe (vertical rows in minor thirds),<br/>nor is it the &quot;converter&quot; (non-generalized) free bass system that has<br/>octaves two rows apart (along a diagonal direction).  Rather it is a<br/>very rare (less than 100 instruments in existence) free bass system<br/>(generalized, with vertical rows in *major* thirds) invented by Mario<br/>Moschino (now deceased) in Chicago in the 1960&apos;s.  The arrangement of<br/>buttons is far, far superior (it&apos;s really no contest) for fingering<br/>facility to that of either the bassetti or converter systems, but it<br/>just didn&apos;t have the money behind it to get the marketing push that<br/>the other two systems had back then (all three systems appeared on<br/>the market in the early 1960&apos;s).  When switching to this system, I<br/>abandoned the old Stradella (bass &amp; chord button) system and have<br/>never desired to go back.</p><p>It has often occurred to me that the accordion (with free bass left<br/>hand, of course) would be an ideal microtonal keyboard instrument --<br/>it&apos;s very portable, stable in pitch, and has a timbre rich in<br/>(harmonic) partials that would easily define intervals beyond the 5<br/>limit.</p><p>Unfortunately, the accordion has also been the butt of many jokes.  I<br/>recall a two-panel cartoon depicting the recently deceased going to<br/>different destinations in the afterlife:  1) Welcome to heaven;<br/>here&apos;s your harp.  2) Welcome to hell; here&apos;s your accordion.</p><p>There are several reasons why this instrument is often made fun of:</p><p>1) Less expensive instruments have machine-made reeds, which are<br/>inferior in quality to hand-made reeds and have a less desirable<br/>sound;</p><p>2) Less expensive instruments lack resonating chambers, which amplify<br/>the lower partials of some of the reeds, which gives a mellower<br/>sound;</p><p>3) Accordion players often don&apos;t have a great deal of musicianship.<br/>In particular, care must be taken to control the bellows so as to<br/>maintain a steady flow of air to avoid a &quot;heaving&quot; sound<br/>or &quot;choppiness&quot;;</p><p>4) The prefabricated chords of the standard Stradella bass system<br/>give a characteristic &quot;cheap&quot; sound that many musicians find<br/>offensive.</p><p>Now to get to the bottom line:  I have a design for a generalized<br/>microtonal free-bass system, an adaptation of the Bosanquet keyboard<br/>that could be played fluently by the left hand without requiring the<br/>use of the thumb.  Systems of up to 31 tones/octave would be possible<br/>using it.  As with the Moschino system, an interval of a tenth would<br/>be an easy reach, and even a double octave would be possible.</p><p>To go along with this, I also have dimensions for a treble (i.e.,<br/>right-hand) keyboard utilizing the Bosanquet geometry (only size and<br/>shape of keys being different from previous designs or<br/>implementations).</p><p>Here&apos;s the challenge:  If you&apos;re going to implement a tonal system on<br/>an accordion, you can&apos;t use more than one tuning on a given<br/>instrument, and it should probably not be any more than about 22<br/>tones per octave (considering space limitations).  I would like to<br/>have an instrument that would:</p><p>1) Permit playing most conventional diatonic music (i.e., without a<br/>comma problem);</p><p>2) Offer a circle of more than 12 fifths around which I could freely<br/>modulate; and</p><p>3) Allow me to play 15-limit otonalities in at least 3 different keys<br/>(temperament is okay, but not so much as to lose the identities of<br/>ratios of 11 and 13);</p><p>4) Offer *all* of the above with uniform fingering patterns in *all*<br/>available keys (utilizing some duplicate keys, of course).  (Left and<br/>right hand patterns are allowed to differ somewhat from each other.)</p><p>Does this sound impossible?  I have a solution for the above which<br/>will map onto a Bosanquet generalized keyboard.  (One of the variable<br/>tuning banks of my Scalatron is currently tuned this way.)  Would<br/>anyone venture a guess as to how it could be done (at least on the<br/>Scalatron)?</p><p>--George</p></div><h3><a id=37954 href="#37954">ðŸ”—</a>oljare &#x3C;oljare@hotmail.com&#x3E;</h3><span>6/19/2002 3:44:05 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>&gt; Here&apos;s the challenge:  If you&apos;re going to implement a tonal system on<br/>&gt; an accordion, you can&apos;t use more than one tuning on a given<br/>&gt; instrument, and it should probably not be any more than about 22<br/>&gt; tones per octave (considering space limitations).

However, I would slant the rows in order to keep all<br/>buttons an octave apart the same distance from the edge.</p><p>&gt; coupled with a matching system in the left hand.</p><p>Implementation of the generalized Bosanquet geometry for the left<br/>hand button-board requires some modification in light of the fact<br/>that the left thumb cannot be used, which has at least two<br/>consequences:</p><p>1) The cross-over-the-thumb scale technique used for the right hand<br/>is not available for the left, so unless some modification were made,<br/>unnatural twisting would occur in the fingering technique.  (This<br/>problem is encountered with the bassetti free bass system, but<br/>elegantly solved with the Moschino system.)</p><p>2) The physical distance the fingers can reach is less, so without<br/>any modification the interval reach would be restricted.</p><p>My microtonal bass-system modification takes both of these factors<br/>into account.  (Diagrams will be put on-line soon.)</p><p>To add to my prior posting, I have another very good reason why the<br/>accordion is often made fun of:</p><p>5) The many harmonics in the timbre of the instrument make the<br/>considerable error of the 12-tone equal temperament all too evident,<br/>if not positively horrendous.</p><p>And I have another reason why it would be an excellent microtonal<br/>instrument:  It has a naturally &quot;straight&quot; sound, lacking the sort of<br/>devices intended to enhance or liven up electronic sounds (vibrato,<br/>phase shifting, etc.) that tend to obscure the differences between 12-<br/>ET and alternate tunings.  Of course, this assumes that in a<br/>microtonal instrument unisons will not be intentionally off-tuned to<br/>produce the characteristic beating of what is called a &quot;wet&quot; tuning.</p><p>--George</p></div>
