However, in Blackjack, the chains are<br/>built up not from fifths, but from secors, of course.</p><p>The result is that we have a different kind of system, and my wisest<br/>response, now that I&apos;ve been clued in, might be to let you and others<br/>ad-JUST the terminology however it best suits your musical purposes.</p><p>Incidentally, a minor correction: I referred to &quot;just&quot; thirds in<br/>Zarlino&apos;s 2/7-comma meantone, but meant &quot;near-just,&quot; since the<br/>approximations of 5:4 and 6:5, and also 9:7 and 7:6, are all<br/>tempered.</p><p>Anyway, while my remarks might relate to some dialogues that come up<br/>on the List, I&apos;d say that yours are much more to the point concerning<br/>Blackjack or any other tuning: the main thing is to make music, as<br/>Ivor Darreg has also urged, and not let notational niceties stop one.</p><p>When dealing with 13-EDO and 20-EDO, tunings where the usual thirds<br/>are not formed from regular chains of &quot;fifths&quot; at 8/13 octave and<br/>12/20 octave, I simply adopt a spelling that tells me where things are<br/>located on the keyboard. That means that &quot;D-A&quot; in 20-EDO is 11/20<br/>octave or 660 cents rather than the usual &quot;fifth&quot; of 720 cents; while<br/>&quot;G-D&quot; or &quot;A-E&quot; in 13-EDO is 7/13 octave or about 646 cents rather than<br/>the &quot;fifth&quot; of about 738 cents (calling for the right timbres to have<br/>a consonant effect like that of a 3:2).</p><p>Maybe a system of special interest here, Joe, is the Wonder Tuning,<br/>with a &quot;bisecor&quot; generator equal to precisely a third of a 3:2 fifth,<br/>or (3:2)^1/3, about 233.985 cents. Manuel Op de Coul, as I noted last<br/>year, gives a version of this in the Scala archive, which in turn he<br/>associates with some ideas of Adriaan Fokker.</p><p>The version of this tuning I&apos;ve come recently to call &quot;23-Skidoo&quot; has<br/>a chain of 23 bisecors, or 24 notes. I&apos;m tempted to conclude that a<br/>quintal notation might be best, grouping the notes into sets of five,<br/>maybe something like this, with the first note of the tuning placed at<br/>0 cents:</p><p>       1        2        3        4       5</p><p>I     234      468      702      936     1170</p><p>II    204      438      672      906     1140</p><p>III   174      408      642      876     1110</p><p>IV    144      378      612      846     1080</p><p>V     114      348      582</p><p>Anyway, with Wonder in its &quot;23-Skidoo&quot; set, unlike Blackjack, we have<br/>a bit of a quandary as to how to decide which thirds and sixths, if<br/>any, set a notational &quot;standard.&quot;</p><p>I call Wonder a &quot;partially just&quot; tuning, because we have pure 3:2<br/>fifths and 4:3 fourths -- but also an irrational element of<br/>temperament in dividing a pure fifth into three equal parts.</p><p>Here we do have some &quot;regular&quot; 408-cent major thirds at 81:64, as in<br/>Pythagorean: 3 bisecors yield a 3:2, and 12 bisecors this third. Thus we<br/>get Pythagorean chains by taking a set of notes at intervals of every<br/>three bisecors.</p><p>However, as you point out with Blackjack, the main point of tuning<br/>23-Skidoo is to get other kinds of thirds -- here, more specifically,<br/>the near-6:7:9 variety. Four bisecors less an octave give us a<br/>264-cent minor third only about 2.81 cents smaller than 7:6, while<br/>seven give us a 438-cent major third only the same amount wider than<br/>9:7. The bisecor itself gives us a near-8:7 or near-7:4 at this same<br/>accuracy. The result is that 12:14:18:21 or 14:18:21:24 is available in an<br/>approximate version at 17 locations, with the fifths pure and the other<br/>intervals off by only this 2.81 cents.</p><p>Thus the near-just major and minor thirds at 438 cents and 264 cents<br/>set the norm, although we have some Pythagorean thirds and other sizes<br/>as well.</p><p>When a tuning isn&apos;t based on a regular chain of fifths, the usual<br/>conventions I discussed in my previous post may not apply -- and if<br/>someone chooses to follow them, the motivations might be somewhat<br/>different than in a tuning where they fit the expected keyboard<br/>layout, for example.</p><p>Anyway, thank you for a reply which not only educated me about<br/>Blackjack, but has gotten me interested again in the Wonder Tuning and<br/>the 23-Skidoo set.</p><p>Most appreciatively,</p><p>Margo Schulter<br/><a href="mailto:mschulter@value.net">mschulter@value.net</a></p></div><h3><a id=33918 href="#33918">ðŸ”—</a>genewardsmith &#x3C;genewardsmith@juno.com&#x3E;</h3><span>2/10/2002 2:26:50 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In tuning@y..., &quot;M.
