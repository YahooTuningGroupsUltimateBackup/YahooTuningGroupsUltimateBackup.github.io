The resolution of this parameter is very fine to also allow, for<br/>example, 25% or 33% scalings.</p><p>You can set the Pitch Bend Range of both Oscillators individually. And in a<br/>range of 10 octaves (120 semitones)!</p><p>----------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p>BTW, Nord&apos;s MicroModular retails for $650. All the power of the big one, but<br/>only one DSP chip &amp; max. 4 voice polyphony. <a href="http://www.clavia.se">http://www.clavia.se</a></p><p>Thanks in advance !</p><p>- Drew</p><p>__________________________________________________<br/>Do You Yahoo!?<br/>Bid and sell for free at <a href="http://auctions.yahoo.com">http://auctions.yahoo.com</a></p></div><h3>McDougall, Darren Scott - MCDDS001 &#x3C;MCDDS001@xxxxxxxx.xxxxx.xxx.xxx&#x3E;</h3><span>10/11/1999 1:02:20 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>&gt; From: &quot;Drew Skyfyre&quot; &lt;<a href="mailto:drew_skyfyre@yahoo.com">drew_skyfyre@yahoo.com</a>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Anyone here care to give a succint explanation about how microtuning works<br/>&gt; on analog synths for Equal Temperaments ? I&apos;d really appreciate it !<br/>&gt;<br/>Many analog synths operate on the one volt per octave specification. This means<br/>that if a control signal of five volts sent to the oscillator causes it to<br/>produce 440 Hz (I don&apos;t know if that truly is the frequency you would get for<br/>5v, just imagine it is for the sake of this example), then six volts would give<br/>880 Hz and four volts would give 220 Hz.</p><p>Keyboards for analog synths (true analog, not analog modelling) produce a<br/>control signal voltage of one twelfth of a volt per key. This voltage is added<br/>to other control signals from LFOs and the pitch-bend wheel before reaching the<br/>frequency control input of the oscillator. Circuitry for keyboard tracking<br/>produces a _new_ control voltage under the control of the 1/12 volt per key<br/>from the keyboard. The new control voltage could be set to decrease when its<br/>input increases (inverted), or it could be adjusted to increase by one<br/>nineteenth of a volt when its input increases by one twelfth of a volt. If the<br/>oscillator was to receive this new control signal instead of the one directly<br/>from the keyboard, you have infinitely tweakable microtonal equal temperaments.</p></div><h3>John Loffink &#x3C;microtonal@xxxxxxxx.xxx.xxxx&#x3E;</h3><span>10/11/1999 5:21:49 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>&gt;&gt; Anyone here care to give a succint explanation about how microtuning<br/>works<br/>&gt;&gt; on analog synths for Equal Temperaments ?

I also found some interesting, related articles on John<br/>Allen&apos;s pages (<a href="http://web0.tiac.net/users/jsallen/music/">http://web0.tiac.net/users/jsallen/music/</a>  [I think]).</p><p>&gt; Note that digitally controlled analog synths and digitally emulated analog<br/>&gt; synths may quantize the &quot;voltage control&quot; or keyboard tracking so that nET<br/>&gt; scales of any degree are not possible.</p><p>Most likely, as fas as the info from a controller(keyboard,etc. goes,<br/>but the &quot;key tracking&quot; parameter that exists in many digi-analog synths<br/>is documented by all the companies I&apos;ve seen as capable of of true nET<br/>microtuning. I&apos;ve checked at Waldorf, Doepfer, Access, Nord.<br/>Oberheim&apos;s OB-Mx, I don&apos;t know (too expensive even for my fantasies :-),<br/>but I know it DOES have tuning tables.</p><p>Quasimidi&apos;s Polymorph ( <a href="http://www.quasimidi.com/englisch/polymorp.htm">http://www.quasimidi.com/englisch/polymorp.htm</a> )<br/>is a groovy synth, but I was unable to determine if it has key tracking.</p><p>My curiousity got me looking around &amp; many (but not all) of the<br/>analog/digital modelling, etc. synths currently available offer<br/>key-tracking, allowing the exploration of myriad Equal Temperaments.<br/>Waldorf&apos;s implementation appears to be the best, with the widest range :<br/>-100% to +200%, with +100% yielding divisions of 1 semitone (100cents),<br/>being 12EDO (12tET). What&apos;s nice is these companies actually include this<br/>feature, &amp; actually document the potential microtonal use, rather than just<br/>an &quot;effect&quot;.</p><p>The synths that don&apos;t offer key tracking seem to be mostly the monophonic<br/>Roland 303 clones, made by numerous companies.</p><p>Funny thing is, the non-analog Ensoniq ASR-X pro has a parameter called<br/>&quot;key track&quot;, with a range of fractional negative &amp; positive options :</p><p>&quot; Off, 1/8, 1/4, 3/8, 1/2, 5/8, 3/4, 7/8, normal,<br/>  9/8, 5/4, 11/8, 3/2, 13/8, 7/4, 15/8, 2, Pitch Table &quot;</p><p>With 1/1 (8/8) being &quot;normal&quot;, &amp; the option to just select the pitch table<br/>(tuning table) of the synth.</p><p>I suppose this means that there&apos;s a whole bunch of ET options available, in<br/>addition to the presets in the tuning table ?</p><p>___________________________________________________________________________<br/>Virus Access &quot;analog&quot; synth<br/><a href="http://www.access-music.de/index.html">http://www.access-music.de/index.html</a></p><p>From the PDF manual :</p><p>KEY FOLLOW (EX)<br/>Determines the intensity of the pitch control via the keyboard: At the value<br/>+32 (standard setting) the oscillator is controlled normally, i.e. the<br/>octave you play is identical to the octave of the oscillator; at +63 every<br/>ascending octave you play transposes the oscillator upwards by two octaves<br/>(whole tone scale); +15 transposes the oscillator upwards by one octave for<br/>every two ascending octaves you play (quarter tone scale); at 0 the keyboard<br/>control option is off.<br/>Negative values generate opposite control intensities.<br/>____________________________________________________________________________</p><p>BTW, I&apos;ve been looking at the demo of the latest SuperCollider release<br/>(2.2.1), <a href="http://www.audiosynth.com">http://www.audiosynth.com</a> , &amp; it just gets better all the time !<br/>PowerMac only, btw.</p><p>It is so easy to work microtonally &amp; in real time ! There r a few microtonal<br/>examples included. James, I don&apos;t know if you&apos;re on this list, but trust me,<br/>if I had the money, I&apos;d have sent you the $250 a while ago ! Meantime, I&apos;ll<br/>try to learn how to use it.</p><p>Personally I believe SC2 is the ONLY software synth worth using, with the<br/>exception of the icon-based Max-MSP, though SC is more powerful &amp; is more<br/>efficient.<br/>____________________________________________________________________________</p><p>Salut,<br/>Drew</p><p>__________________________________________________<br/>Do You Yahoo!?<br/>Bid and sell for free at <a href="http://auctions.yahoo.com">http://auctions.yahoo.com</a></p></div>
