Your list<br/>is a good start.</p><p>How did you arrive at the boundaries between names?<br/>Looks like they&apos;re all powers of 2, and that can&apos;t be<br/>an accident ...</p><p>I do wonder about the &quot;-tempered&quot; part.  It seems to<br/>imply the existence of a tempering where they may<br/>have been none.  Perhaps &quot;-cordant&quot; - or better,<br/>&quot;-sonant&quot;, since we&apos;re talking about the physically<br/>measurable difference between fundamental tones -<br/>would serve in its place?  Thus -<br/> 4-8 cents harmonious<br/> 2-4 cents consonant<br/> 1-2 cents millisonant<br/> 1/2-1 cents microsonant<br/> 1/4-1/2 cents nanosonant<br/> &lt; 1/4 cents sensibly JI</p><p>But then, if we really are looking at a progression in<br/>powers of 2, the prefixes &quot;milli-&quot;, &quot;micro-&quot; and &quot;nano-&quot;<br/>rather exaggerate the change of scale.  Shouldn&apos;t<br/>we use &quot;semi-&quot;, &quot;demi-&quot; and &quot;hemi-&quot; instead?  On the<br/>analogy, of course, with the terms used in British music<br/>teaching for subdivisions of the quaver (in American<br/>usage: &quot;eighth note&quot;): semiquaver, demisemiquaver,<br/>hemidemisemiquaver.  Thus -</p><p> 4-8 cents harmonious<br/> 2-4 cents consonant<br/> 1-2 cents semisonant<br/> 1/2-1 cents demisemisonant<br/> 1/4-1/2 cents hemidemisemisonant<br/> &lt; 1/4 cents sensibly JI</p><p>Clumsy, I think ... It would be better if we had short<br/>prefixes meaning &quot;quarter&quot; and &quot;eighth&quot;.</p><p>Regards,<br/>Yahya</p><p>--<br/>No virus found in this outgoing message.<br/>Checked by AVG Anti-Virus.<br/>Version: 7.0.338 / Virus Database: 267.9.5/58 - Release Date: 25/7/05</p></div>
