But there it is.</p><p>Joe, it&apos;s not too hard to understand what Woolhouse is saying. Read it<br/>again.</p><p>(a) most meantones are not closed systems<br/>(b) ETs other than 12-tET do not have &quot;but one sound for both a sharp and<br/>the flat of the next upper note&quot;. In other ETs, Ab is different from G#, for<br/>example.</p><p>&gt;In what instance<br/>&gt;must a keyboard &apos;necessarily have but one sound for both a<br/>&gt;sharp and the flat of the next upper note&apos;?</p><p>If it has only 12 notes per octave!</p><p>&gt;An emphasis on that sentence seems to me to betray a slyly<br/>&gt;indignant way of implying that if one chooses to have an<br/>&gt;instrument specially built with more than 12 keys, then<br/>&gt;there are other temperaments that are better.</p><p>So you do understand? But what&apos;s slyly indignant about it?</p><p>&gt;And here he utters the most important sentence in the book<br/>&gt;(and the basis of Paul&apos;s admiration of his work), where he<br/>&gt;sets out:</p><p>&gt;&gt; [Woolhouse 1835, p 45]<br/>&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt; ... to ascertain the particular values which must be assigned<br/>&gt;&gt; to the *tone* and *diatonic semitone*, so that all the concords<br/>&gt;&gt; shall be affected with the least possible imperfections; and<br/>&gt;&gt; this we shall effect by the principle of least squares.  We<br/>&gt;&gt; must first observe, that the *third-minor*, *third-major* and<br/>&gt;&gt; *fourth*, are the only concords necessary to be considered,<br/>&gt;&gt; because the others are merely the inversions of these, and<br/>&gt;&gt; we know that any error which may increase or diminish a concord,<br/>&gt;&gt; will have precisely the same effect in decreasing or increasing<br/>&gt;&gt; its inversion, as the octave, which is composed of them both,<br/>&gt;&gt; is unchangeable.</p><p>&gt;(This is the same method Paul used to discover his 7/26-comma<br/>&gt;meantone tuning.)</p><p>Right.</p><p>&gt;Putting that on a lattice for a geometric view of the situation:</p><p>&gt;           E<br/>&gt;          / \<br/>&gt;        M3   m3<br/>&gt;        m6   M6<br/>&gt;       /       \<br/>&gt;      C -P4/P5- G</p><p>You could just as easily have depicted a minor triad instead.</p><p>&gt;It should be obvious that the 5-limit lattice can be extended<br/>&gt;infinitely in both dimensions by adding on additional cells<br/>&gt;just like this one (or parts of it), thus proving Woolhouse&apos;s<br/>&gt;statement.</p><p>Not sure what it proves.</p><p>&gt;(I have added ratios and Semitones, and for comparison, the<br/>&gt;cents-values for his optimal 6/13-&amp;-9/26-comma):</p><p>&gt;                     50-tET          6/13-&amp;-9/26-comma meantone</p><p>Joe, I don&apos;t know why you&apos;re using such a strange name for Woolhouse&apos;s<br/>optimal temperament (is that what Woolhouse called it?). In 1/6-comma<br/>meantone temperament, the 10/9 is tempered by 2/3-comma, and the 16/15 by<br/>negative 1/6-comma. Do we call it &quot;2/3-&amp;-negative 1/6-comma meantone&quot;? No,<br/>we simply call it 1/6-comma meantone, after the amount by which the fifth is<br/>tempered. Similarly, in 7/26-comma meantone, the 10/9 is tempered by</p><p>1 - 2*(7/26) comma<br/>= 1 - 7/13 comma<br/>= 6/13 comma</p><p>and the 16/15 is tempered by</p><p>5*(7/26) - 1 comma<br/>= 35/26 - 1 comma<br/>= 9/26 comma</p><p>So what Woolhouse discovered was simply 7/26-comma meantone. I&apos;m glad he and<br/>I agree!</p><p>&gt; [Woolhouse 1835, p 46]<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt; This system is precisely the same as that which Dr. Smith,<br/>&gt;&gt; in his Treatise on harmonics [Smith 1759], calls the scale<br/>&gt;&gt; of equal harmony.  It is decidedly the most perfect of any<br/>&gt;&gt; systems in which the tones are all alike.</p><p>Is Woolhouse here referring to 50-tET or 7/26-comma meantone? Smith&apos;s ideal<br/>tuning was almost exactly 5/18-comma meantone, which is close to 50-tET but<br/>on the other side of it relative to 7/26-comma meantone.</p><p>&gt;He then analyzes the resources of a 53-tET &apos;enharmonic organ&apos;,<br/>&gt;built by J. Robson and Son, St. Martin&apos;s-lane, but says that<br/>&gt;the number of keys is too much to be practicable, and settles<br/>&gt;again on 19-tET.</p><p>53-tET would also be subject to the same objection he levelled on JI, while<br/>19-, 31-, and 50-tET would not.</p><p>&gt;He certainly noted the disadvantages of strict 5-limit JI, yet<br/>&gt;he sought ultimately a temperament which would approximate it<br/>&gt;better than 12-tET.</p><p>And one that would eliminate the comma, which 12-, 19-, 31-, 43-, 50-, and<br/>55-tET do, but 53-tET does not.</p><p>&gt;Noticing that Woolhouse based his meantone not on a constant<br/>&gt;7/26-comma applied to all intervals as Paul did, but rather<br/>&gt;on the *two* basic intervals of the scale, the &apos;tone&apos; and<br/>&gt;&apos;semitone&apos;,</p><p>It of course amounts to the same thing.</p><p>&gt;So it turns out that Woolhouse actually *did* describe<br/>&gt;Paul&apos;s 7/26-comma meantone, but not in that way.  Woolhouse<br/>&gt;described it in terms of a &apos;5L,2s&apos; mapping, whereas Paul<br/>&gt;describes it based on a cycle of tempered 2:3s.  Hmmm...</p><p>&gt;Perhaps someone will bother to go thru the drudgery to<br/>&gt;show us exactly why it works out both ways; I&apos;m certainly<br/>&gt;interested, especially in how 12/26 and 9/26 averages out<br/>&gt;to 7/26!</p><p>Again, in 7/26-comma meantone, the 10/9 is tempered by</p><p>1 - 2*(7/26) comma [because a 10/9 is two fifths up and a comma down, and<br/>the direction of the tempering is opposite that of the fifth]<br/>= 1 - 7/13 comma<br/>= 6/13 comma</p><p>and the 16/15 is tempered by</p><p>5*(7/26) - 1 comma [because the 16/15 is five fifths up and a comma down]<br/>= 35/26 - 1 comma<br/>= 9/26 comma</p><p>&gt;&gt; the &quot;optimal&quot; meantone he derived (from 16th-18th century<br/>&gt;&gt; musical considerations)</p><p>&gt;As far as I recall, Woolhouse doesn&apos;t specifically mention<br/>&gt;anything about repertoire.</p><p>The construction of the diatonic scale, and the statement about the<br/>difficulty in practice introduced by the two theoretical values of the note<br/>D, are both considerations highly specific to Western commom practice<br/>repertoire (including, I would say, most pop music).</p><p>&gt;since we&apos;ve all heard<br/>&gt;so much about how well 53-tET approximates both 3- and<br/>&gt;5-limit JI and relatively little about 50-tET, how about<br/>&gt;showing us exactly why 50-tET is better.</p><p>Again, it&apos;s the diatonic scale, and the fact that 53-tET (like 15-, 22-,<br/>27-, 34-, and 41-tET) has two different versions of &quot;D&quot; while 50-tET (like<br/>12-, ) does not. So everything Woolhouse says to admonish JI applies to<br/>53-tET as well.</p></div><h3><a id=7077 href="#7077">ðŸ”—</a>Paul H.

By comparison, 12-tET is consistent at the<br/>5-limit only to level 3: the ratio  648:625 (often called the greater<br/>diesis) can be constructed from four 6:5 minor thirds; while four minor<br/>thirds (minus an octave) add up to a unison in 12-tET, the actual size of<br/>648:625 in JI is 62.565 cents, so it rounds up to one step in 12-tET. 53-tET<br/>is consistent at the 5-limit to level 8.</p><p>Bosanquet&apos;s 612-tET is almost as good, as it is consistent at the 5-limit to<br/>level 21. In order to improve on the consistency level of 730-tET in the<br/>5-limit, one would have to go up to 1783-tET, which is consistent to level<br/>42 (heh, I just said level 42), and then to improve on that, 4296-tET is<br/>5-limit consistent to level 119. Note that 4296 is a multiple of 12. So if<br/>you wanted to get a 12-tET-based synthesizer to provide ridiculously exact<br/>JI (5-limit consonances within 0.002 cents of just), you could design it to<br/>divide the semitone into 4296/12 = 358 equal parts . . . Being a little more<br/>realistic, note that 612 is also divisible by 12 and gives 5-limit<br/>consonances within 0.093 cents of just . . .</p></div><h3><a id=7083 href="#7083">ðŸ”—</a>Herman Miller &#x3C;hmiller@xx.xxxx&#x3E;</h3><span>12/19/1999 8:21:00 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>On Sun, 19 Dec 1999 17:33:16 -0500, &quot;Paul H.

I&apos;m certainly very glad I went thru the<br/>trouble of getting a copy of this book - it&apos;s a small but<br/>very valuable addition to my library!</p><p>And thanks very much to Paul for his valuable clarifications<br/>and additions on what I had to say about Woolhouse.  Following<br/>are some further comments.</p><p>&gt; [Paul Erlich, TD 447.17, in his initial response to the<br/>&gt; question of what type of limit Woolhouse had in mind]<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Joe, clearly Woolhouse means an _integer_ limit of 5, not<br/>&gt; a prime- _or_ odd-limit.</p><p>My initial response to that was:</p><p>Thanks for clearing that up, Paul.  I think that&apos;s an<br/>important point in his theory.  Woolhouse blithely skims<br/>over many things that your or I (or lots of others) would<br/>probably elaborate much more fully.</p><p>But after reading Paul&apos;s subsequent observation, where<br/>Woolhouse is about to set out his &apos;optimal meantone&apos; tuning:</p><p>&gt; [Paul Erlich, TD 447.23]<br/>&gt; I&apos;d have to say that here (which is where it matters),<br/>&gt; Woolhouse is thinking of 5 as the _odd_ limit, since in an<br/>&gt; odd limit all intervals are considered equivalently to their<br/>&gt; inversions.</p><p>I&apos;ll say that I have to agree.  This is clearly a 5-odd-limit.<br/>Hmmm... then again, it *could* be a 5-prime-limit too,<br/>couldn&apos;t it?...  But in any case, it&apos;s *not* a 5-integer-limit.</p><p>&gt;&gt; [me, monz, TD 446.6]<br/>&gt;&gt; [p 24] Then follows Woolhouse&apos;s crucial statement concerning<br/>&gt;&gt; JI versus temperament, without mentioning commatic drift:<br/>&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt; [Woolhouse 1835, p 24]<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt; This difference in the note D, which in theory is a comma,<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt; is entirely done away with in practice, as the harmonic<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt; advantages which could be derived from the true theoretical<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt; scale, as directed by nature, would by no means compensate<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt; the difficulties of its performance.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; [Paul, TD 447.17]<br/>&gt; Commatic drift or shift would be two ways of addressing these<br/>&gt; difficulties.</p><p>It&apos;s obvious that he&apos;s talking about commatic drift or shift<br/>- I think the difference is negligible in Woolhouse&apos;s case,<br/>since his point is to get rid of it -, and he does explain the<br/>retunings that would be necessary on the second degree of the<br/>scale (the &apos;D&apos; in C major here) to clear up the problems, but,<br/>at least in *this* book, he never actually comes right out and<br/>*says* that commatic drift is the problem.</p><p>In the posting from Dave Hill that originally started all<br/>this, where he quotes Fischer quoting Woolhouse, Woolhouse<br/>says about JI:</p><p>&gt; Singers and performers on perfect instruments (i.e., not<br/>&gt; fixed pitch: violins, etc.) ... on arriving at the same<br/>&gt; notes by different routes, would be continually finding<br/>&gt; a want of agreement.</p><p>So here he clearly expresses the musical movement that would<br/>cause commatic drift.  But this quote is not in the _Essay<br/>on Musical Intervals..._ - at least I never found it there.<br/>It must appear in something else Woolhouse wrote.</p><p>&gt;&gt;&gt; [Woolhouse 1835, p 41]<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt; This scale [12-tET] is, without doubt, the best one for<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt; such instruments as the common pianoforte, organ, &amp;c. which<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt; must necessarily have but one sound for both a sharp and the<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt; flat of the next upper note.<br/>&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt; [me, monz]<br/>&gt;&gt; An emphasis on that sentence seems to me to betray a slyly<br/>&gt;&gt; indignant way of implying that if one chooses to have an<br/>&gt;&gt; instrument specially built with more than 12 keys, then<br/>&gt;&gt; there are other temperaments that are better.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; [Paul, TD 447.17]<br/>&gt; ... what&apos;s slyly indignant about it?<br/>&gt;</p><p>Well... the whole point of Woolhouse&apos;s book is to present<br/>and explain tunings that he feels are better than 12-tET<br/>(or 12-EDO), and considering the fact that he goes thru all<br/>the trouble of determining 7/26-comma meantone, and finding<br/>the more practical 50-EDO close approximation to it, and then<br/>finally accepts 19-EDO as more practical still, it seems<br/>awfully strange that he uses such strong language when he<br/>says &apos;This scale [12-tET] is, *WITHOUT DOUBT* [emphasis mine],<br/>the best one for such instruments...&apos;.</p><p>Sounds to me like, just for that one moment, he was succumbing<br/>to the status-quo simply because of the improbability that anyone<br/>would go thru the trouble to build an instrument to his<br/>specifications.  Maybe it&apos;s just the way I&apos;m reading it.</p><p>But I do think that it points out one of the things Dave<br/>was originally discussing: that this book emerged at a time<br/>(1835) when 12-tET had still not fully &apos;conquered&apos; the musical<br/>scene.  Woolhouse clearly felt the need to express a very<br/>positive opinion about 12-tET *given certain conditions*,<br/>even tho he knew there were other, better alternatives which<br/>required different conditions.</p><p>In fact, 12-EDO may not yet have been the status-quo in<br/>England.  From what I&apos;ve read, England seems to have been<br/>the last country in Europe to generally adopt 12-EDO,<br/>and so perhaps he was really making a legitimate push for<br/>it here.  But he certainly would have appreciated a more<br/>inventive approach to building instruments, because he<br/>clearly preferred 19-EDO.</p><p>&gt;&gt; [me, monz]<br/>&gt;&gt; Putting that on a lattice for a geometric view of the<br/>&gt;&gt; situation:<br/>&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt;           E<br/>&gt;&gt;          / \<br/>&gt;&gt;        M3   m3<br/>&gt;&gt;        m6   M6<br/>&gt;&gt;       /       \<br/>&gt;&gt;      C -P4/P5- G<br/>&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; [Paul, TD 447.17]<br/>&gt; You could just as easily have depicted a minor triad instead.</p><p>Absolutely true - but all of Woolhouse&apos;s JI descriptions are<br/>based on the 5-limit &apos;major&apos; scale and &apos;major&apos; chords.  He<br/>certainly implicity included &apos;minor&apos;, but doesn&apos;t *explicity*<br/>say anything about it, except concerning the commatic problems<br/>of the &apos;D&apos; second degree.  I was just presenting his own<br/>explanations in diagrammatic form.</p><p>&gt;&gt; [me, monz]<br/>&gt;&gt; It should be obvious that the 5-limit lattice can be extended<br/>&gt;&gt; infinitely in both dimensions by adding on additional cells<br/>&gt;&gt; just like this one (or parts of it), thus proving Woolhouse&apos;s<br/>&gt;&gt; statement.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; [Paul, TD 447.17]<br/>&gt; Not sure what it proves.</p><p>It proves what he said in the part I quoted just before that:</p><p>&gt; [Woolhouse 1835, p 45]<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; the *third-minor*, *third-major* and *fourth*, are the only<br/>&gt; concords necessary to be considered, because the others are<br/>&gt; merely the inversions of these, and we know that any error<br/>&gt; which may increase or diminish a concord, will have precisely<br/>&gt; the same effect in decreasing or increasing its inversion</p><p>You can see plainly on the lattice that all these intervals<br/>and their inversions can be added on infinitely in any direction<br/>without involving any other intervals, which was his point.<br/>He uses these three intervals in his derivation of the<br/>7/26-comma meantone.</p><p>Tell you what... I&apos;ll make a separate post quoting his<br/>mathematics for this derivation.</p><p>&gt;&gt; [me, monz]<br/>&gt;&gt; his optimal 6/13-&amp;-9/26-comma<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; [Paul, TD 447.17]<br/>&gt; Joe, I don&apos;t know why you&apos;re using such a strange name for<br/>&gt; Woolhouse&apos;s optimal temperament (is that what Woolhouse<br/>&gt; called it?).</p><p>No - he actually didn&apos;t call it anything at all.  He says,<br/>by way of introducing it:</p><p>&gt; [Woolhouse 1835, p 41]<br/>&gt; A system of sounds may, however, be formed, in which all the<br/>&gt; keys are more nearly approximate than that of equal semitones<br/>&gt; [= 12-EDO] ...</p><p>And then, after he&apos;s described the math for his &apos;optimal meantone&apos;<br/>(that&apos;s either your name or Mandelbaum&apos;s), he calls its close<br/>cousin 50-EDO [p 46] &apos;decidedly the most perfect of any systems<br/>in which the tones are all alike&apos; [i.e., in which the 81/80<br/>(syntonic comma) vanishes].  But he never really puts a<br/>name on that meantone tuning.</p><p>Woolhouse segues *very* quickly after that into 50-EDO, and<br/>never mentions that meantone again anywhere else in the book,<br/>so I really don&apos;t think he ever actually envisioned its use<br/>at all in practice.  It&apos;s just a mathematically optimum<br/>tuning, which he certainly thought could be well enough<br/>represented by 50-EDO (with less than 2-cents error from<br/>the meantone) if anyone actually wanted to try to build an<br/>instrument in *that* tuning, and which he clearly felt<br/>19-EDO (with up to ~16 cents error from the meantone) came<br/>close enough to for practical purposes.</p><p>(I&apos;ve added to my webpage a table of cents values and error<br/>from the 7/26-comma meantone for 19-EDO.)</p><p>I didn&apos;t realize, until I carried the calculations of both<br/>his scale and your 7/26-comma meantone out to 12 decimal<br/>places, that they were indeed exactly the same tuning.<br/>So that weird name is just my earlier description of it,<br/>which I suppose I should change to &apos;7/26-comma&apos;.  I certainly<br/>appreciate your mathematical explanation that shows that<br/>they are both the same.  Thanks!</p><p>&gt;&gt; [Woolhouse 1835, p 46]<br/>&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt; This system is precisely the same as that which Dr. Smith,<br/>&gt;&gt; in his Treatise on harmonics [Smith 1759], calls the scale<br/>&gt;&gt; of equal harmony.  It is decidedly the most perfect of any<br/>&gt;&gt; systems in which the tones are all alike.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; [Paul,  TD 447.17]<br/>&gt; Is Woolhouse here referring to 50-tET or 7/26-comma meantone?</p><p>He&apos;s referring here to 50-tET (which I&apos;d rather call 50-EDO),<br/>is Dr. Smith&apos;s &apos;scale of equal harmony&apos;.</p><p>A side note: those who have looked at my webpage of this will<br/>see that I&apos;ve changed &apos;tET&apos; to &apos;EDO&apos; in every case.  I did<br/>that because Woolhouse specifically states that the &apos;octave&apos;<br/>is always to be a 1:2 ratio.</p><p>&gt; [Paul, TD 447.17]<br/>&gt; Smith&apos;s ideal tuning was almost exactly 5/18-comma meantone,<br/>&gt; which is close to 50-tET but on the other side of it relative<br/>&gt; to 7/26-comma meantone.</p><p>How do you know that?!  Do you have access to Smith&apos;s book?!<br/>Tell us more!!</p><p>&gt;&gt; [me, monz]<br/>&gt;&gt; He certainly noted the disadvantages of strict 5-limit JI,<br/>&gt;&gt; yet he sought ultimately a temperament which would approximate<br/>&gt;&gt; it better than 12-tET.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; [Paul, TD 447.17]<br/>&gt; And one that would eliminate the comma, which 12-, 19-, 31-,<br/>&gt; 43-, 50-, and 55-tET do, but 53-tET does not.</p><p>Yes, I realized after I put the posting together that Woolhouse&apos;s<br/>objection to 53-tET would be the differentiation of the comma.</p><p>But still, he likes its close approximations to JI well enough<br/>to keep including it (and 31-EDO) in his tables thru-out the<br/>rest of the book.</p><p>The webpage is at:</p><p><a href="http://www.ixpres.com/interval/monzo/woolhouse/essay.htm">http://www.ixpres.com/interval/monzo/woolhouse/essay.htm</a></p><p>I&apos;ll add this to it too.  Paul, let me know if you mind my<br/>adding your postings to the webpage - I think they&apos;re<br/>valuable commentary.  The more math, the better.</p><p>I&apos;d love to be able to figure out an accurate lattice diagram<br/>of the actual Woolhouse/Erlich 7/26-comma meantone, to accompany<br/>the simple one of its 5-limit JI implications.  Actually, my<br/>lattice formula can probably already do it...</p><p>-monz</p><p>Joseph L.
