Your site<br/>&gt; does have a lot of information I haven&apos;t even dreamed of before.<br/>&gt; In particular, I was looking for the definitions of these<br/>&gt; tunings, Kirnberger and  werkmeister. Are thes familiar?<br/>&gt; Are they called something else on your site? I found these<br/>&gt; tunings available on several digital keyboards and would<br/>&gt; like to experiment with them. Thanks for your input.</p><p>Thanks for the kind words about my work... glad you find<br/>it useful.</p><p>I refer to the Kirnberger and Werckmeister as &quot;well-temperaments&quot;.<br/>There&apos;s an entry for that in the dictionary, but unfortunately,<br/>I haven&apos;t devoted a lot of time to either of these theorists yet.</p><p>Please note that what I define as &quot;well-temperament&quot; is also<br/>known to other theorists as &quot;irregular&quot; or &quot;circulating&quot; temperament.<br/>All three names are commonly accepted today.</p><p>Actually, it&apos;s really interesting to me that you write this to<br/>me at this particular time, because while I studied Werckmeister<br/>a bit about two years ago (and do hope to eventually someday do<br/>more research on his tunings), I have just in the last two weeks<br/>been studying the temperament known as &quot;Kirnberger III&quot;,<br/>because I&apos;ve been learning Beethoven&apos;s &quot;Moonlight Sonata&quot; and<br/>believe that Kirnberger III may have been a typical tuning on<br/>Beethoven&apos;s piano at the time he wrote the sonata.</p><p>So I&apos;ve actually made a MIDI-file of the beginning of Beethoven&apos;s<br/>piece in Kirnberger III tuning, and of course, have constructed<br/>lattice diagrams with which to analyze it.</p><p>One reason I chose Kirnberger III as typical is because it is<br/>so conceptually simple, and therefore quite easy to tune by ear<br/>as well.  Here&apos;s how it works:</p><p>Our reference will be &quot;C&quot;, and the set of pitches tuned will<br/>be given the letter-names Db to F#.  The &quot;major 3rd&quot; C:E is tuned<br/>to the &quot;pure&quot; 5:4 ratio.  The &quot;5ths&quot; and &quot;4ths&quot; C:G:D:A:E are<br/>all tuned equally slightly narrow (i.e., 1/4-syntonic-comma)<br/>to match the 5:4 already tuned between C:E.  Then all other<br/>&quot;4ths/5ths&quot; are tuned as 3:2 ratios in two chains: one going<br/>thru the &quot;cycle of 4ths&quot; from C, and the other thru the<br/>&quot;cycle of 5ths&quot; from E.</p><p>Thus, my lattice for it looks like:</p><p>                 Db<br/>                 /<br/>                /<br/>              Ab<br/>              /<br/>             /<br/>           Eb<br/>           /<br/>          /<br/>        Bb<br/>        /<br/>       /<br/>      F<br/>     /<br/>    /<br/>   C _<br/>       G _<br/>           D _<br/>               A _<br/>                   E<br/>                  /<br/>                 /<br/>                B<br/>               /<br/>              /<br/>             F#</p><p>It just so happens that the &quot;wolf 5th&quot; F#:Db is<br/>~700.0012801 cents, not all that much of a &quot;wolf&quot;:</p><p>   note  prime-factor  ratio    ~cents</p><p>    Db     3^-5       256:243   90.22499567<br/>    F#     3^2 * 5^1   45:32   590.2237156</p><p>I have tables of interval sizes, implied proportions, etc.,<br/>and will eventually be putting it all into a webpage, along<br/>with my audio files of Beethoven&apos;s piece.</p><p>love / peace / harmony ...</p><p>-monz<br/><a href="http://www.monz.org">http://www.monz.org</a><br/>&quot;All roads lead to n^0&quot;</p><p>_________________________________________________________<br/>Do You Yahoo!?<br/>Get your free <a href="https://twitter.com/yahoo">@yahoo</a>.com address at <a href="http://mail.yahoo.com">http://mail.yahoo.com</a></p></div>
