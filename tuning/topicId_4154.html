What I&apos;ve been<br/>trying to do is play real music with real musicians, so that I can learn as<br/>much as possible about the art before I go off in a solitary direction.<br/>Every style of music is capable of moving people in different ways, each<br/>with its own set of subtleties and nuances (including those of pitch!), so<br/>by getting a handle on a wide range of styles I&apos;m learning how to<br/>communicate through music. It&apos;s something that has to be felt. I think I&apos;m<br/>doing well on this path and my microtonal compositions and improvisations so<br/>far, though primitive, have convinced me that there is much more to be felt<br/>than what 12-equal is capable of.</p></div><h3><a id=5276 href="#5276">ðŸ”—</a>patrick pagano &#x3C;ppagano@xxxxxxxxx.xxxx&#x3E;</h3><span>10/6/1999 4:06:26 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Paul E wrote</p><p>&gt; Patrick, that&apos;s not a flame at all and I totally agree with you.<br/>&gt;<br/>i agree that was not a real flame on<br/>i am just tired of 12 tet but i will state that you have to begin somewhere and<br/>to recruit and play with new musicians sometimes you must meet them on territory<br/>they are familiar with (12tet) and then if you are a competent musical director<br/>you may steer the ensemble into Just mean tone etc.....<br/>good luck to you on yr path and you and D.B. should let the music do the talking<br/>~<br/>i have heard Beardsley&apos;s pieces and they are a force to reckon with<br/>i cannot comment on yours as i have not heard any<br/>ciao<br/>Pat Pagano</p><p>&gt; Patrick, that&apos;s not a flame at all and I totally agree with you.</p></div><h3><a id=5279 href="#5279">ðŸ”—</a>David Beardsley &#x3C;xouoxno@xxxx.xxxx&#x3E;</h3><span>10/6/1999 3:21:43 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Carl Lumma wrote:</p><p>&gt; David Beardsley wrote...<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;Traitor.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; To be a traitor one must first have sworn not to trade against something.</p><p>Eh?
