They are in all other respects the same as the other numbers<br/>and all the same theorems apply - you can add, subtract and multiply<br/>them, they are prime or composite, 3 limit, 5 limit, 7 limit etc<br/>and so forth.</p><p>The reciproccals of the non standard finite numbers are the<br/>infinitesimals.</p><p>Now, the way Abraham Robinson introduced these was rather complex.<br/>That&apos;s because he started with a theory that basically said they<br/>couldn&apos;t exist, but he found you could introduce them all the same<br/>using a special kind of construction.</p><p>At that time all mathematicians though they were impossible.<br/>He gave them respectability by showing that you can prove all the ordinary<br/>calculus results using them, and get _exactly_ the same results.<br/>To do this he introduced his star transform to go back and forth<br/>between the ordinary numbers and the infinitesimals.</p><p>I think someone wrote a kind of introductory calculus<br/>text book (high school, to first year undergraduate level)<br/>using infinitesimals  as the basis if I remember correctly,<br/>so there is this interest in presenting non standard analysis<br/>in a simpler way - you don&apos;t need to mention the star transform<br/>except perhaps to say in the introduction to the book<br/>that such a technique exists and shows that you<br/>get the same results this way as by the standard method..</p><p>However, if you are interested in studying the non standard numbers<br/>on their own terms you don&apos;t need to use the star transform at all.<br/>Instead you can use a technique pioneered by Mycielski, or in set theory,<br/>pioneered by Vopenka. Mycielski&apos;s one is the easiest to explain.</p><p>What you do is to start with the five peano axioms - that there is a<br/>number 1, that every number has a successor, that numbers that have<br/>the same successor are identical, that 1 isn&apos;t the successor of any<br/>other number, and mathematical induction, which is the powerful one<br/>- that if something is true for n = 1, and if<br/>its truth for n implies its truth for n+1 for any n, then its<br/>true for all n.</p><p>All you do is to add the idea of a feasible number, and two<br/>extra axioms to describe how it works. One is that if n is feasible,<br/>so is n+1. The other is that there exists a number which isn&apos;t feasible.</p><p>Finally, an important point, you _don&apos;t_ add F into the induction<br/>axiom schema - you can&apos;t use induction with it.</p><p>That gives non standard finite numbers already. They aren&apos;t the<br/>Abraham Robinson ones. I prefer to call them seemingly finite<br/>numbers.</p><p>You can prove that the resulting system is consistent if<br/>the Peano axioms are consistent, which is the best one<br/>can do as Godel showed that you can never prove consistency<br/>of the Peano axioms.</p><p>You can&apos;t do much with this predicate F, for instance you can&apos;t<br/>yet prove that the product of two feasible numbers is always<br/>feasible, because that would need induction.</p><p>So then the idea is to gradually add in more properties for<br/>F, until you get a system powerful enough for what you want.<br/>You can actually add in full induction for F so long as<br/>you do it in a separate axiom and don&apos;t combine the two,<br/>and always keep clear whether you are applying induction<br/>on the feasible numbers only, or on the entire set of finite<br/>and seemingly finite numbers.</p><p>You can use a similar approach in set theory. I mean<br/>mathematical set theory here - perhaps best thought of<br/>as a study of the notion of membership, and what it<br/>means for one mathematical object to be a member of another<br/>one.</p><p>That is also based on induction, again, you have feasible sets,<br/>and two induction axioms, one for the feasible sets,<br/>and one for all the finite sets. Plus, there ae a few<br/>more details to figure out with set theory.</p><p>That then in a nutshell is what I was working on.</p><p>The relevance for harmonic series etc. is kind of philosophical.<br/>It relates to rational intonation rather than just intonation.</p><p>It means that even the golden ratio, say, can be represented<br/>by a ratio, in fact, infinitely many ratios all the same<br/>up to an infinitesimal. So you will have 3 limit versions of<br/>the golden ratio too, 5 limit ones, and so on, depending<br/>on which of the infinitesimally identical values you choose.</p><p>Robert</p></div><h3><a id=38352 href="#38352">ðŸ”—</a>Robert Walker &#x3C;robertwalker@ntlworld.com&#x3E;</h3><span>7/1/2002 6:09:20 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Hi there,</p><p>Sorry, of course you also have to add in the axiom<br/>that 1 is feasible, otherwise you might have no feasible<br/>numbers to study!</p><p>Robert</p></div><h3><a id=38354 href="#38354">ðŸ”—</a>genewardsmith &#x3C;genewardsmith@juno.com&#x3E;</h3><span>7/1/2002 6:57:58 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In tuning@y..., &quot;Robert Walker&quot; &lt;robertwalker@n...&gt; wrote:</p><p>&gt; Sorry, of course you also have to add in the axiom<br/>&gt; that 1 is feasible, otherwise you might have no feasible<br/>&gt; numbers to study!</p><p>As an algebraist I prefer the ultrafilter construction anyway. :)</p></div><h3><a id=38357 href="#38357">ðŸ”—</a>Robert Walker &#x3C;robertwalker@ntlworld.com&#x3E;</h3><span>7/1/2002 8:26:31 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Hi Gene,</p><p>&gt; As an algebraist I prefer the ultrafilter construction anyway. :)</p><p>I like it too - it&apos;s a neat thing and beautiful.</p><p>There&apos;s nothing to stop you doing a similar thing the other way too<br/>- start within the finite / seemingly infinite numbers to construct the<br/>standard finite numbers and the Cantorian ordinals, in fact<br/>Vopenka, who is a model theorist I believe, did some work<br/>on models of ZF in the alternative set theory.</p><p>Robert</p></div>
