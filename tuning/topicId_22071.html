Just so happens that I had about ten minutes to<br/>read the list this morning, and then leave for what we working<br/>musicians call a 3 service day: 2 full &quot;Childrens Concerts&quot; in the<br/>am, 1.25 hours to set up a huge percussion setup for a 3 hour<br/>rehearsal in the afternoon, and then a 3.5 hour dress rehearsal<br/>of &quot;Aida&quot;. As I write this reply it is 11:30 at night, and I&apos;m<br/>wasting time having to answer this kind of jive.</p><p>So very sorry to not have had all day in front of the computer to<br/>answer a question that may have a lot of ins-and-outs, with regard to<br/>performing and broadcasting rights, and is not a simple &quot;here it is,<br/>folks&quot;. Yeah, the stuff means a lot to me, especially since I helped<br/>produce the 3 CRI discs.</p><p>I&apos;ve answered a couple of Partch questions recently, when I had the<br/>time and the answers that I felt confident in.</p><p>&gt; But I don&apos;t know any further details...</p><p>But you sure can give out advice on what *my* responsibilities on the<br/>list are.
