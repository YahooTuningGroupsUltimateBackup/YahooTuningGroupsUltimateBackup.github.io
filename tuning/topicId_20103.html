The concept for my 1st album cover (&quot;The Gate&quot;)<br/>arrived in my head in a most unusual way. What made it even more<br/>interesting for me was the fact that, at the time, I was planning on<br/>doing a jazz album, non microtonal, and was thinking about setting up<br/>recording time. I was driving home, late at night, thinking about this<br/>jazz project, when, all of a sudden, a picture of an album cover<br/>appeared, totally complete and in full color, in my mind. It literally<br/>appeared, from the right side of my head, and moved to the center of my<br/>interior vision...I said &quot;Whoa, what&apos;s this!&quot; As I looked at it, I<br/>realized that this cover was NOT connected with the jazz project in any<br/>way...in fact, I realized that this cover would fit my 19 tone music<br/>perfectly instead. It was at that precise moment that I decided to do<br/>&quot;The Gate&quot; (as the album art had to do with that concept).<br/>   Now, this event happened to me...I in no way assembled this cover art<br/>by any sort of logical thinking process...indeed, it just appeared in my<br/>mind, as I mentioned. Seeing this cover art was, in fact, the reason I<br/>did &quot;The Gate...&quot; The cover art pointed the musical direction, which I<br/>find very interesting. I never would have thought of that. Since that<br/>time, all of my album covers have been created, in my mind, without the<br/>aid of pencils or paper, or any kind of traditional artistic devices...I<br/>don&apos;t sit down and start doodling with ideas...I just SEE them, and<br/>that&apos;s how they are created.<br/>    I find this process fascinating..I do, indeed, feel, at times, like<br/>someone on the other side of this life, is showing me ideas/concepts,<br/>and guiding me do do the things I do. I have found that, when I follow<br/>this guidance, my projects come out very well, and I am satisfied that I<br/>have done what I was put here to do. So, this relates directly to how<br/>ideas/melodies appear on the guitar when I compose...I am not much into<br/>hypothetical situations; thus, I don&apos;t care what would happen if I had<br/>no guitar in my hands, or I used a piano instead. I am content with the<br/>way these things manifest themselves in my creative life. The creative<br/>process may well be different for everyone; I&apos;m sure it is. Yet, I would<br/>also imagine there could well be similarities between the way different<br/>people create..I am hoping that some of the folks on this list might<br/>want to relate their creative processes...it could make for interesting<br/>reading...thanks for the comments...Hstick</p></div><h3>Haresh BAKSHI &#x3C;hareshbakshi@hotmail.com&#x3E;</h3><span>3/11/2001 12:14:26 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In tuning@y..., &quot;Neil Haverstick&quot; &lt;STICK@U...&gt; wrote:</p><p>.......... when, all of a sudden, a picture of an album cover<br/>&gt; appeared, totally complete and in full color, in my mind.

It is such an intrinsically<br/>personal experience for each creator, and to know the ways that<br/>others work is illuminating.</p><p>Continued best on your unfolding voyage.</p><p>And finally, so that this doesn&apos;t end up real sappy and gooey, if you<br/>read the subject that you posted this note in *real* fast, it is<br/>almost like we&apos;re talking about the &quot;moron creative process&quot;. :)</p><p>Cheers,<br/>Jon</p></div>
