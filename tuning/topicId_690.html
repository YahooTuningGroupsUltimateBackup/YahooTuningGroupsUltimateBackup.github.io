No new sonorities of<br/>merit or new structural possibilities that could be heard. The last<br/>movement had a improvised trumpet solo if that helps with identifying the<br/>piece. He used a vibraphone somehow which didn&apos;t make sense at the time.If<br/>you used these same instruments in an atonal context they wouldn&apos;t play in<br/>12ET anyway so if they played &quot;other&quot;pitches they weren&apos;t any different.<br/>Honestly He has never done anything for me even over hearing his music over<br/>years. Cold. At best they work best in a group of his pieces, on their own<br/>it kind like Bruckner in a shorter period of time in the sense of motion<br/>that doesn&apos;t add up.I should maybe learn to be as brief as Carl. sucks</p><p>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;Then again the Old  (Avant garde) Wine in new (microtonal)<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; So it was the style of music?</p><p>&quot;I didn&apos;t hear any style at all!&quot;</p><p>-- Kraig Grady<br/>North American Embassy of Anaphoria Island<br/><a href="http://www.anaphoria.com">www.anaphoria.com</a></p></div>
