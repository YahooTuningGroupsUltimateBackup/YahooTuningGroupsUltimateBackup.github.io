In the past two years, I have<br/>learned more about music theory in my spare time than I could have learned<br/>full-time at any conservatory in the world (assuming they didn&apos;t have<br/>access to the list :).</p><p>Along the way I have made countless errors of fact and demeanor.  Of those<br/>who have been there with me, I cannot say the same.  Maybe I&apos;m just dense,<br/>but I have never encountered anything but the most cheerful input from the<br/>regulars on this list.  Contributions here are of the highest order.  What<br/>counts as turmoil here, recent and past, doesn&apos;t even register on machines<br/>designed to measure turmoil on other lists.</p><p>Despite my gripes with an advertising-supported listserv, I think onelist<br/>is a good place for us, at least for now.  Reliability, low cost, and most<br/>of all Visibility are good.  If anything, the quality of the list has<br/>improved since the move.</p><p>Negative input is often much easier than positive, and I don&apos;t think recent<br/>talk of too much math is an exception.  I would love to see more about<br/>instrument design, playing techniques, and ear training tapes on this list.<br/> But I don&apos;t see how forming a seperate list is going to create this content.</p><p>Further, I would like to encourage, with every ounce of my strength,<br/>self-promotion on this list.  We need an economy folks (never thought I&apos;d<br/>hear myself say that -- must be getting old)!!!  The two-sentence post<br/>Haverstick made for the release of Acoustic Stick was probably the most<br/>educational post I&apos;ve ever read on this list!  Gary wants to make ear<br/>training tapes?  I&apos;ll buy them!  (Thanks for those tapes, Gary, a little<br/>fit and finish and you&apos;re ready for the ad in Keyboard, right next to David<br/>L. Burge!)</p><p>Lastly, on the topic of the FAQ.  This past November I made a detailed<br/>outline of a good basic FAQ.  My plan was to write it, post it, then<br/>encourage spiffy articles from the rest of you.  If I ever get out of the<br/>50hr/wk job, I&apos;ll actually do it.</p><p>-C.</p></div>
