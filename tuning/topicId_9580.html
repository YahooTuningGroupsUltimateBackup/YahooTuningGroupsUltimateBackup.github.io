You should definitely<br/>re-negotiate or go elsewhere.  While income from score sales are negligible<br/>(rentals can be more lucrative), no publisher of serious music (Peters,<br/>Schott, Boosey etc.)  should get any more than half of the licence fees for<br/>performances, broadcasts and mechanicals.  And composers with any draw can<br/>negotiate these royalties down quite a bit, typically limiting the<br/>publisher&apos;s share to a third, or less if the publisher fails to promote the<br/>work, and also depending upon how much the publisher invests in the<br/>published materials.</p><p>Frog Peak and Material Press concentrate on score sales alone and most of<br/>the composers retain 100% of their royalties.</p><p>Daniel Wolf</p></div><h3>D.Stearns &#x3C;STEARNS@CAPECOD.NET&#x3E;</h3><span>4/17/2000 4:22:44 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Joseph Pehrson wrote,</p><p>&gt; Virtually ALL of my music now includes microtonality,</p><p>I noticed that Joe has put up another batch of nice pieces at his<br/><a href="http://mp3.com">mp3.com</a> site, and two of these are certainly very &quot;microtonal&quot;: the JI<br/>&quot;Harmonic Etude&quot; for the Belgian French horn virtuoso Francis Orval,<br/>and the 1/8th tone &quot;One Small Step for Man&quot; for bassoonist Johnny<br/>Reinhard - Check &apos;em out.</p><p>Dan</p></div>
