Maybe disliking/liking of some music is not<br/>genetically based, but this basic attitude to the more adventurous<br/>life style is. Mankind would be more far in the science and art if<br/>the first group prevails.<br/>But I believe that people can get used to dissonant new music, but<br/>they must hear it since the early age, and it&apos;s connected with the<br/>other education as well. It has something to do with the tolerance to<br/>something unusual, it&apos;s a part of general attitude to the life. An<br/>open-minded  person with a lot of interests will accept something<br/>unknown or different than their previous experience without<br/>prejudices and bias.

I hope I&apos;m not pushing my point too hard with this response; the issue is important for me.</p><p>I am suspicious of all attempts to essentialize and then &quot;biologize&quot; cultural factors and matters of personal taste. One always ends up claiming that some music is &quot;natural&quot; to mankind&apos;s biological system, which ends up meaning that other music is not.&nbsp; What appears natural to the researcher is almost without exception the music of the researcher&apos;s own culture (and/or social class)--no surprises there. One can relativize this essentialism, leaving each culture with its own &quot;hard-wired&quot; tastes, but this leads to absurdities, as it can&apos;t explain rapid mixing of cultures and would overdrive natural selection to an absurd degree.&nbsp;</p><p>Or one can fudge the facts and say that all music (except that of which I don&apos;t approve) shares the same characteristic of the music that I think is &quot;natural&quot; to mankind--this is more or less the tactic of my former teacher, Fred Lerdahl. He started with common practice western music, found properties in it similar to the properties of language, and has been finding these elements in the music of various cultures, but not finding them in works of modern western art music.&nbsp; This is not in itself problematic, but when he started to speak of human universals in this regard, I had to part company: certain characteristics are universal to all the world&apos;s music except contemporary art music written by composers such as Boulez.&nbsp; It seems on the surface absurd to discover deep similarities between performances of ritualistic music&nbsp; (i.e., participatory music-making that cannot even be considered a piece in the same sense as Classical art music) and Debussy,<br/> for example, but none between Debussy and Boulez, a highly sophisticated musician deeply influenced by Debussy.&nbsp;</p><p>Boulez isn&apos;t necessarily my favorite composer, but that is because of my tastes in music. It irritates me whenever people try to convert their tastes into laws for others by the scientistic route, because someone will always come along (call him Richard Taruskin) and use these &quot;findings&quot; to club some composer or type of music he or she doesn&apos;t like (I&apos;m thinking of his attacks on Martino and Babbitt).&nbsp; Both science and pseudo-science share the same jargon and appear to a casual observer objectively true to an equal degree.</p><p>Another problem with all these arguments is that they can&apos;t explain variance of tastes within cultures; one would expect out of genetic hard-wiring more uniformity than actually appears. Yet various people within any culture, even within any social group, disagree about&nbsp; the pieces they all&nbsp; know.&nbsp; The simple fact is that the appreciation of art forms such as music are far more influenced by social factors, education, and individual peculiarities and ideals than by biological factors.&nbsp; And even the biological factors can be over-rated: some people with biologically-given talents in music become successful businessmen and never learn much about music, whereas less naturally gifted people can become fine musicians.</p><p>We can all listen to a justly-tuned triad and agree that it is consonant, and&nbsp; there may well be a biological hard-wiring that attracts us to it (as discussed in This is Your Brain on Music). But the step from acknowledging this to making universalized aesthetic judgments is a big one; one might love the sound of the major chord but believe that it is not that useful in creating an interesting piece of music of the sort one wants to write.&nbsp; Or another way of looking at it: composers in the Renaissance almost without exception used major and minor triads.&nbsp; Yet some of these composers are very boring, some--such as Josquin, perhpas my favorite--are viscerally exciting.&nbsp; The difference can&apos;t lie in the presence or absence of major and minor triads. It also can&apos;t lie in the presence or absence of syntactic structures (cadences, etc.) shared by all composers.</p><p>I have no problem with people making claims and theories concerning their tastes and defending them openly and honestly.

I hope I&apos;m not pushing<br/>&gt; my point too hard with this response; the issue is important for me.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I am suspicious of all attempts to essentialize and then &quot;biologize&quot;<br/>&gt; cultural factors and matters of personal taste. One always ends up<br/>&gt; claiming that some music is &quot;natural&quot; to mankind&apos;s biological<br/>&gt; system, which ends up meaning that other music is not.  What appears<br/>&gt; natural to the researcher is almost without exception the music of<br/>&gt; the researcher&apos;s own culture (and/or social class)--no surprises<br/>&gt; there. One can relativize this essentialism, leaving each culture<br/>&gt; with its own &quot;hard-wired&quot; tastes, but this leads to absurdities, as<br/>&gt; it can&apos;t explain rapid mixing of cultures and would overdrive<br/>&gt; natural selection to an absurd degree.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Or one can fudge the facts and say that all music (except that of<br/>&gt; which I don&apos;t approve) shares the same characteristic of the music<br/>&gt; that I think is &quot;natural&quot; to mankind--this is more or less the<br/>&gt; tactic of my former teacher, Fred Lerdahl. He started with common<br/>&gt; practice western music, found properties in it similar to the<br/>&gt; properties of language, and has been finding these elements in the<br/>&gt; music of various cultures, but not finding them in works of modern<br/>&gt; western art music.  This is not in itself problematic, but when he<br/>&gt; started to speak of human universals in this regard, I had to part<br/>&gt; company: certain characteristics are universal to all the world&apos;s<br/>&gt; music except contemporary art music written by composers such as<br/>&gt; Boulez.  It seems on the surface absurd to discover deep<br/>&gt; similarities between performances of ritualistic music  (i.e.,<br/>&gt; participatory music-making that cannot even be considered a piece in<br/>&gt; the same sense as Classical art music) and Debussy, for example, but<br/>&gt; none between Debussy and Boulez, a highly sophisticated musician<br/>&gt; deeply influenced by Debussy.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Boulez isn&apos;t necessarily my favorite composer, but that is because<br/>&gt; of my tastes in music. It irritates me whenever people try to<br/>&gt; convert their tastes into laws for others by the scientistic route,<br/>&gt; because someone will always come along (call him Richard Taruskin)<br/>&gt; and use these &quot;findings&quot; to club some composer or type of music he<br/>&gt; or she doesn&apos;t like (I&apos;m thinking of his attacks on Martino and<br/>&gt; Babbitt).  Both science and pseudo-science share the same jargon and<br/>&gt; appear to a casual observer objectively true to an equal degree.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Another problem with all these arguments is that they can&apos;t explain<br/>&gt; variance of tastes within cultures; one would expect out of genetic<br/>&gt; hard-wiring more uniformity than actually appears. Yet various<br/>&gt; people within any culture, even within any social group, disagree<br/>&gt; about  the pieces they all  know.  The simple fact is that the<br/>&gt; appreciation of art forms such as music are far more influenced by<br/>&gt; social factors, education, and individual peculiarities and ideals<br/>&gt; than by biological factors.  And even the biological factors can be<br/>&gt; over-rated: some people with biologically-given talents in music<br/>&gt; become successful businessmen and never learn much about music,<br/>&gt; whereas less naturally gifted people can become fine musicians.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; We can all listen to a justly-tuned triad and agree that it is<br/>&gt; consonant, and  there may well be a biological hard-wiring that<br/>&gt; attracts us to it (as discussed in This is Your Brain on Music). But<br/>&gt; the step from acknowledging this to making universalized aesthetic<br/>&gt; judgments is a big one; one might love the sound of the major chord<br/>&gt; but believe that it is not that useful in creating an interesting<br/>&gt; piece of music of the sort one wants to write.  Or another way of<br/>&gt; looking at it: composers in the Renaissance almost without exception<br/>&gt; used major and minor triads.  Yet some of these composers are very<br/>&gt; boring, some--such as Josquin, perhpas my favorite--are viscerally<br/>&gt; exciting.  The difference can&apos;t lie in the presence or absence of<br/>&gt; major and minor triads. It also can&apos;t lie in the presence or absence &gt; of syntactic structures (cadences, etc.) shared by all composers.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I have no problem with people making claims and theories concerning<br/>&gt; their tastes and defending them openly and honestly. My main fear is<br/>&gt; that scientism tends to claim an absolute authority than it doesn&apos;t<br/>&gt; deserve.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; best<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Franklin<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Dr. Franklin Cox<br/>&gt; 1107 Xenia Ave.<br/>&gt; Yellow Springs, OH 45387<br/>&gt; (937) 767-1165<br/>&gt; franklincox@...<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; --- On Mon, 1/25/10, Daniel Forr&oacute; &lt;dan.for@...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; From: Daniel Forr&oacute; &lt;dan.for@...&gt;<br/>&gt; Subject: Re: [tuning] Ambissonance<br/>&gt; To: <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a><br/>&gt; Date: Monday, January 25, 2010, 12:38 AM<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I can&apos;t see any variance in my and your statements, they are<br/>&gt; compatible, you&apos;ve just added something more to it.

I would risk<br/>myself to say that for example &quot;neutral thirds&quot; or &quot;ambi&quot;-thirds as<br/>you say have a range of only less than a comma (there are 17 cents<br/>between 39/32 and 16/13, which I already consider as &quot;not as neutral&quot;<br/>as 11/9 or 27/22, which resume to 7 cents).<br/>These spots are not always in the middle of most common notes around.<br/>The sensible zone between sensation of a wholetone and a minor third<br/>is for me, much closer  to 8/7 than to 7/6.<br/>And once you integrate one of those points, finer others may appear.<br/>With a more common practice of neutral thirds, you may find<br/>ambissonances between neutral sixths and major sixths, and so on.<br/>Of course again these zones can only be relative to musical contexts,<br/>to your culture and your evolution.<br/>Rarely two beings hear the same things (and it&apos;s nice if they can<br/>exchange about it...).<br/>One dimension in music listening or making we don&apos;t consider enough<br/>is what I call our &quot;thought of the sound&quot;, in the present. It&apos;s one<br/>thing our listening cannot be dissociated from, at anytime.<br/>Everyone has experimented that when the music stops, sound remains in<br/>your head, and I&apos;ve seen several concerts where people at the end of<br/>the music could only stay silent.<br/>Therefore, because we have already sounds around us and in our head,<br/>that change all the time, we never listen the same way to one same<br/>piece of music. And it&apos;s nice that we all have our own transcendental<br/>ambissonance zones and other intimate mysteries that keep our minds<br/>open.<br/>- - - - - - -<br/>Jacques</p></div><h3><a id=85840 href="#85840">ðŸ”—</a>Marcel de Velde &#x3C;m.develde@...&#x3E;</h3><span>1/25/2010 12:08:39 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Sorry, but I&apos;d like to hear some actual music in which there are clear<br/>&quot;ambisonics&quot; that actually sounds good to me.<br/>I suspect that the cultural thing will be used when it doesn&apos;t sound good to<br/>me.<br/>But as far as I can tell now such ambisonics have no place in common<br/>practice classical music.<br/>And btw contemporary classical is often very unmusical, almost nonsense no<br/>wonder most people don&apos;t like it, it&apos;s not the people it&apos;s the crap music.<br/>(with many exceptions offcourse, though these tend to be popular again in<br/>the public)<br/>So as far as I&apos;m following this now ambisonics means out of tune to me ;-)</p><p>Marcel</p></div><h3><a id=85841 href="#85841">ðŸ”—</a>Carl Lumma &#x3C;carl@...&#x3E;</h3><span>1/25/2010 1:21:48 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, Marcel de Velde &lt;m.develde@...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Sorry, but I&apos;d like to hear some actual music in which there<br/>&gt; are clear &quot;ambisonics&quot; that actually sounds good to me.</p><p>I&apos;d like to read a definition of &quot;ambisonic&quot; that makes any<br/>kind of sense.</p><p>-Carl</p></div><h3><a id=85842 href="#85842">ðŸ”—</a>Carl Lumma &#x3C;carl@...&#x3E;</h3><span>1/25/2010 1:19:50 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Hi Chris,</p><p>&gt; I don&apos;t understand your intention when you cite low and high<br/>&gt; points - which means what?</p><p>Points of low or high separation between academic and popular<br/>music.

I believe you are talking solely&nbsp; about post-WWII composition in America, but even then your statement is not accurate. There are thousands of composers today writing post-tonal music, and there are networks and festivals throughout the world for this music.&nbsp; Many of these composers are doing most of their compositional work outside the academy.

Sorry to use some terminology which could be considered marxistic, for sure I&apos;m not marxist but we must consider economical-political situation in the society even when talking about the art.</p><p>I don&apos;t think dividing music into &quot;popular&quot; and &quot;academic&quot; types is quite exact. Music has some role, function in society, therefore it&apos;s rather connected to different layers, classes in the society. If we accept such sociological attitude, then there&apos;s a slightly different picture of music history.</p><p>First there was church music as a mainstream for long centuries in the history of European music, and this situation was changed slowly when Reformation started and Catholic church (and nobility which supported the Church from political and economical point of view as Church also supported the nobility - both milked the common working classes) started to have less influence, and also economical situation started to change from feudalism to capitalism. Bourgeoisie supported secular music - concert music or opera. It doesn&apos;t mean they supported avantguard music...<br/>Church music also changed during 1000 years from its original avantguard position to the role of tradition&apos;s guardian, and became conservative and repeating the similar style and certain patterns and cliches (they tried to change this so late as in the second half of 19th century). But it had always high standard of performance and lot of excellent composers and performers were involved in it, some of them solely, later only partly besides the secular works. In old times this music was performed by professionals (also monks), much later amateur musicians performed it (remember Bach&apos;s complains about the quality of his church orchestra).</p><p>Then there was court music for nobility - mainly for the purpose of entertainment (dance parties, background table music for eating or music before sleep - Bach&apos;s Goldberg variations are good example even for such musicotherapeutic role of music}, but we can find here also beginning of pure &quot;concert music&quot;, music just for listening.  Composed and performed by professional musicians - trouvers, troubadours, minnesangers (who travelled), and some musicians had music as job at the court. Some courts, or castles or nobility families had even their own orchestras which disappeared in the beginning of 19. century when after the French revolution nobility started to lose their power as social class, and couldn&apos;t afford to employ orchestras. Bach, Haydn and Mozart still worked in such orchestras as court musicians and composers, I remember also excellent Czech composer Jan Ladislav Dusik who was employed by Prince Louis Ferdinand of Prussia still in 1806 as his personal composer, musician and music teacher.<br/>We can find here also some very avantguard and bizarre manneuristic styles, like Ars subtilior or Italian chromatic madrigal, very far from common music of those times. Composers of such music were &quot;sponsored&quot; by educated nobility class, so sometimes even such unusual things could occur and find listeners (which is rather questionable).</p><p>Then there was composed &quot;popular&quot;, secular music for common people - mainly dance music. As they had to work, there was not much time left to the entertainment and enjoying music in their life, only at some local festivals or dance parties. It was also performed by professional musicians, often they were city employees.<br/>Of course also anonyme folklore music started as a part of daily life of common classes - ceremonial (wedding, funerals, births...), work, dance... This music was mainly vocal, songs with lyrics. Dance music was mainly instrumental, as well as some work music (pastoral shepherds flute music for example). Anybody could make such music, it became an organic  part of daily life.</p><p>Another possibility to hear music was military music, marches etc.</p><p>Something like &quot;concert music&quot; for masses didn&apos;t existed. Music always served to some purpose, working classes had no time and opportunity to enjoy just listening to music. But even common people could hear high quality church music in the biggest churches (of course not in some small village church). Much later general public could visit the opera or concert halls and pay for listening the music.</p><p>Music was not yet printed those times. This was a big limiting factor, as media were always very important for spreading the culture. After 15. century music could be printed.</p><p>So even in Middle age there was a gap in the music style between &quot;high&quot; (church and court secular)  and popular music, I mean not only in their social role and target group, but also from purely musical point of view. The only common element were scales, but even here I feel difference in use. Meanwhile church music preferred to use Aeolian, Phrygian or such &quot;sad&quot; and serious modes, secular and folklore music used Dorian, Ionian, Mixolydian or Lydian modes. Also intervallic structure is slightly different.</p><p>Dispite the fact that &quot;contemporary&quot; music was generally accepted from &quot;contemporary&quot; listeners until Baroque, a gap between music for educated higher classes and common masses started to be more visible in the end of 18th century. It doesn&apos;t mean that educated classes always wanted only complex deep avantguard brain-storming music, of course not - they expected also entertainment from music. Even Mozart&apos;s piano concerts, divertimentos and operas could be considered as  contemporary pop-music (and his concerts were visited, people could hear professionally made music only there or in the church thanks to non-existence of recording media, or they can try to play it from printed scores, but also level of difficulty came up). He has more complex and interesting and deeper and artistic and experimental and avantguard music in his piano sonatas,  string quartets or late symphonies. Even such man of genius was accepted by Viennese society mainly as a pianist and music teacher.</p><p>Interesting fact in the history of music is that some composers were aware of a difference between &quot;high&quot; and &quot;popular&quot; music and tried to connect both worlds - remember popular secular song &quot;L&apos;homme arme&quot; used in the Church music, or some early using of folklore quotations (Neusiedler, ...

Mainly piano music, lot of middle class families could afford grand piano. Hence lot of arrangements, paraphrases and medleys of symphonies, operas etc. But also songs were popular (Lieder, Couplets - popular music of those times before recording media started). Piano music and piano performing was popular, but as the level of piano performing was high  (especially composers who were pianists - Mozart, Dusik, Beethoven, Chopin, Schumann, Liszt, Smetana, Debussy, Skriabin...) it was clear that such music can be performed well only by educated professionals. Also this increase in music complexity could be one reason why common people can&apos;t play classical music, and even are not interested to listen to it when it became even more complex and dissonant during 20th century,<br/>&gt; but it was often Beethoven or Mozart being played from<br/>&gt; manuscript by the young lady of the house.<br/>&gt;<br/>Why from manuscript? It was possible to buy printed scores. And see above - this music is not so easy to be performed by amateurs and hobby musicians. But for sure in their times the general level of music education was higher so probably more people than today could perform it.<br/>&gt; Among poorer<br/>&gt; people, probably music was more often improvised.<br/>&gt;</p><p>Can be said about the instrumental music (that&apos;s a base of folklore). Or because they couldn&apos;t afford to buy expensive professionally made musical instruments, they used simple hand made ones. Or they could make vocal music without instruments.</p><p>&gt; We still<br/>&gt; have a direct lineage to this in our folk music today, and<br/>&gt; through efforts such as Beethoven&apos;s settings of Irish songs.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; The avante garde also has a long history, dating back at<br/>&gt; least to the Notre Dame school in the Ars Nova. They were<br/>&gt; probably just as insular as the serialists of the 20th<br/>&gt; century.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; What I am saying is I do not think that &quot;cultured&quot; music was<br/>&gt; &gt; ever &quot;the&quot; popular music and perhaps we should stop lamenting<br/>&gt; &gt; for something that isn&apos;t real.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I think the division between popular, experimental, and<br/>&gt; academic music has probably shifted over time, from low points<br/>&gt; like the late Tudor period in England to high points like<br/>&gt; the 1950s in the United States.<br/>&gt;<br/>Yes, and this division was probably not linear, there could be some periods when it was more near. Good example is Mozart - some of his opera arias were taken by common masses and become very popular shortly after the first performance, even sung in the pubs and on the street, but again were forgotten (like today&apos;s popsongs). Or take American minimal music (Glass, Reich, Adams...) - there&apos;s nothing which would prevent such music to become popular.<br/>&gt; Today I see the primary<br/>&gt; driving force as recording technology. On one hand, it has<br/>&gt; drastically reduced the average musical skill of the population,<br/>&gt; since one does not need any musical skill to hear and enjoy<br/>&gt; music. This has worked to increase the separation between<br/>&gt; popular and academic forms.<br/>&gt;<br/>This is true only partly IMHO. I would accuse mainly the education system, and change of music (and generally role of art in the society), also changed preferences. Of course recording media supported this. But still there&apos;s a lot of printed music scores and who wants to make music actively, can do it so easily nowadays. Also thanks to modern instruments like portable keyboards. I was against them long years, but soon I started to understand problem is not in their existence, but in their bad use. So we are again back to education.</p><p>But I wouldn&apos;t see things so negative. Lot of young people still study music, maybe not violine or trumpet, OK, they use synthesizers or PK&apos;s, so still there&apos;s some hope for music culture.</p><p>&gt; On the other hand, the ability of<br/>&gt; musicians to cheaply publish recordings has since the 1990s<br/>&gt; resulted in a popularization of experimental forms not seen<br/>&gt; since the prog rock era.

Not music for everybody&apos;s taste, and one of the peak but also cul-de-sacs of Western music. Therefore some reaction came and new styles appeared (Minimalism, New Simplicity, World Music....).<br/>But it&apos;s here and for sure it has its position, listeners, composers and performers (including me). What I really like on our times is this plurality and coexistence of many styles and their crossfades, mixes and syntheses. All have right and reason for existence if there&apos;s at least one creator and one listener (it can beeven one person only).<br/>&gt; &gt; Main stream pop is exceeding conservative musically.<br/>&gt;<br/>It was always so. Thanks to it it is a mainstream :-)<br/>&gt; Yes, but it&apos;s also not all that popular today, either.<br/>&gt; Christina Aguilera was apparently the last pop star, rap is<br/>&gt; dead, indie has wound down... we&apos;re in musical purgatory at<br/>&gt; the moment.<br/>&gt;<br/>Yes, but pop music mainstream was in certain sense always behind the art music mainstream, with little innovations to general development of music culture.<br/>&gt; And if the level of music presence in community<br/>&gt; events I see around the bay area is typical, probably music<br/>&gt; will die out altogether in another 50 years.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>I wouldn&apos;t be so pessimistic concerning this, there will be always some kind of music people will enjoy.

But that&apos;s ok, it&apos;s got an iPod inside it.<br/>&gt; And everyone I know has an iPhone. But I&apos;ve never seen one<br/>&gt; of them use the iPod function. I&apos;ve had an iPhone for 3 years<br/>&gt; and I think I&apos;ve used it to play music 5 times.<br/>&gt;<br/>I have no explanation for this phenomenon...<br/>&gt; Maybe my friends and I are just getting older, and only young<br/>&gt; people listen to music. That&apos;s possible I suppose, I dunno.<br/>&gt;<br/>Yes. Generally - who has time to stop anything and just listen to music? Probably only young people, or old people. We poor workers and employees in active age must make some money to feed our families.<br/>Besides, there&apos;&apos;s a lot of music (or better said music noise) and generally noise level everywhere and people are tired from it.<br/>Besides, me as a music professional, I have enough music in my life being composer and performer and whatever else connected with music, so I don&apos;t need to listen so much. My brain is always full of music, mine or somebody&apos;s else.</p><p>&gt; Where I&apos;m from in PA, everybody learned basic music skills.<br/>&gt;<br/>Yes, it&apos;s scientifically proofed music has very positive effect in general education. Unfortunately not every Ministry of Education heard about it.<br/>&gt; Involvement in school choir and band programs was high. People<br/>&gt; took piano lessons. People were in bands. People sang in<br/>&gt; church. The dead heads had drum circles. The local band,<br/>&gt; founded 1906, played every year at the 4th of July festival.<br/>&gt; Halloween parades, football games, and so on, all featured<br/>&gt; music prominently. More importantly, if you went up to a guy<br/>&gt; on the street and sang a pitch, he could match it. Gallop<br/>&gt; should start doing this every year - I&apos;d be curious if any<br/>&gt; trend is observed.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; -Carl<br/>&gt;<br/>This still exists, situation is not so tragical, but probably less in the comparison with my younger days in 60&apos;s and 70&apos;s.

There is currently  a large &gt; infrastructure for new music in Europe, most of it outside the &gt; academy; this includes regular concert series, performances by &gt; symphony orchestras, opera performances, and so forth.<br/>&gt;<br/>I don&apos;t think this music is performed as it would deserve, it&apos;s not so often on the concert programs.</p><p>&gt; It might interest you to know that Berg and Webern never taught in &gt; a university, Schoenberg only began teaching in an academy in his &gt; 50&apos;s, Ives and Ruggles never taught in a university, nor did Varese &gt; or Wyschnegradsky, and so forth.<br/>&gt;<br/>Yes, Schonberg was excellent teacher, but as far as I know he taught mainly traditional music theory, composition, harmony, counterpoint and analysis - not his dodecaphony or atonal music.  It&apos;s enough clear from his theoretical textbooks.<br/>&gt; It is hard to find many major composers of the first part of the &gt; 20th century who were not influenced by Schoenberg and his school &gt; in some way, but this was not owing to  academic training, which &gt; was in general biased against Schoenberg and the &quot;atonalists.&quot; Do &gt; you really think that Berg, Stravinsky, Bartok, Varese, Ruggles, &gt; etc., were &quot;academic composers&quot;?  Do you really consider all of &gt; these composers insignificant? I believe you are talking solely  &gt; about post-WWII composition in America, but even then your &gt; statement is not accurate. There are thousands of composers today &gt; writing post-tonal music, and there are networks and festivals &gt; throughout the world for this music.  Many of these composers are &gt; doing most of their compositional work outside the academy. In &gt; fact, in my experience, the biases within the academy against &gt; adventurous music--such as microtonal music--are usually severe. It &gt; has been very hard to get hired  as a composer in a university if &gt; one writes music in 1/4 tones and with complex rhythms, especially &gt; if the music is not considered positive and affirming.

Modern music is actually fairly non-genre-based in many ways: you hear classical excerpts even in things like hip-hop and often jazz chord progressions and brass leads in underground dance music and electronica backgrounds, filters, and flanger effects scattered through modern rock music.</p><p>  There are a few genres which remain &quot;pure&quot;, like folk and bluegrass...but most genres rip off techniques and attitudes from each other left and right...and, IMVHO, there&apos;s nothing wrong with that; it&apos;s just evolution.<br/>   As a side note I&apos;m a huge supporter of what musicians like Sevish(mostly drum&amp;bass)/Neil-Haverstick(rock)/Marcus-Satellite(dance&amp;ambient) are doing, which is combine microtonal flare to existing genres in the same way classical and jazz flare is often applied to modern genres and not using an &quot;us vs. them&quot; mentallity about it all.  Sneak a bit of micro-tonallity into an otherwise familiar sounding work and let other artists evolve the degree in which micro-tonallity is used...until at least a good deal of it becomes &quot;accepted as normal&quot;.</p><p>________________________________<br/>From: Kalle &lt;kalleaho@...&gt;<br/>To: <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a><br/>Sent: Wed, January 27, 2010 8:02:43 AM<br/>Subject: [tuning] Re: Ambissonance</p><p>--- In tuning@yahoogroups. com, &quot;Carl Lumma&quot; &lt;carl@...&gt; wrote:</p><p>&gt; Actually the early music scene is quite vibrant on its own<br/>merits.</p><p>&gt; Jazz is widely considered to be a dead form.

Humans have a<br/>&gt; basic need for music. If it cannot be met without creating the<br/>&gt; music oneself, that is a big deal. This necessity, along with<br/>&gt; the predominance of monophonic instruments (or one may say, the<br/>&gt; expense of polyphonic ones) is a primary reason music notation<br/>&gt; was invented in the first place.<br/>&gt;<br/>Also different other ways how to write music, for example<br/>tablatures... or figured bass, or chord signs... or graphical scores...<br/>&gt; And notation allowed esoteric<br/>&gt; music to develop, creating the divide between popular and<br/>&gt; &apos;academic&apos; forms.<br/>&gt;<br/>I wouldn&apos;t evaluate role of notation so highly. Yes, it&apos;s important,<br/>it enabled fixing of performed music, but anyway it&apos;s not quite exact<br/>picture of performed music, so it can be even limiting or at least<br/>distorting factor. I take it just as a way how to write down music.<br/>How it could help in the composition? Composer can work just with the<br/>sound in his imagination, with pitches, rhythms and timbres, and<br/>later just write down a finished work on the paper (Mozart, Sch&ouml;nberg<br/>and many others).</p><p>Besides composers of both main styles - art music and popular music -<br/>can use improvisation as well as notation. Dividing line is not in<br/>the knowledge of the standard notation.<br/>&gt; Audio recording has caused a sharp decline in the ability to<br/>&gt; read music notation. Not only among the public, but also among<br/>&gt; musicians. In fact, most musicians no longer use notation<br/>&gt; at all. American music is an entire pillar built on musicians<br/>&gt; passing along techniques through recordings. Many jazz<br/>&gt; guitarists would learn tunes through one another&apos;s recordings.<br/>&gt; Art Tatum learned by feeling a player piano. etc.<br/>&gt;</p><p>That can be true, but despite my classical education in music when I<br/>have no problem with scores, sight-reading and similar, I started<br/>slowly to think it&apos;s maybe not so important to know this all. There<br/>are more possible ways how to study music, and listening is one of<br/>them. I have worked with blind musicians, pretty good, they can&apos;t<br/>work with standard scores, so they had alternative ways how to learn<br/>music. They were used to their methods and didn&apos;t need scores.<br/>And for the performing score isn&apos;t necesssary at all, without looking<br/>into the score musician can better concentrate on the controlling the instrument.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Prog rock was the first avant garde genre not to use music<br/>&gt; notation.<br/>&gt;<br/>What&apos;s so avant-garde in prog rock in your opinion? Or maybe you have<br/>just some different definition of &quot;avant-garde&quot; or &quot;prog rock&quot; than me.<br/>Yes, it&apos;s more complex music than mainstream pop, in some cases. Therefore I don&apos;t think it was created by uneducated amateur<br/>musicians without knowledge of notation and some music theory.</p><p>&gt; Well ok, maybe bebop, but let&apos;s continue: it was multitrack<br/>&gt; recording that made this possible. In hindsight<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; we can see the advent of multitrack studio recording causing<br/>&gt; the progressive rock movement, starting with the Beatles and<br/>&gt; their 4-track. It enabled complexity to be built up without<br/>&gt; the use of notation.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; -Carl<br/>&gt;</p><p>And for sure there&apos;s nothing wrong with such attitude to making<br/>music. It&apos;s just another way how to do it. It&apos;s a proof that absence<br/>of knowledge of standard music notation not necessarily has bad<br/>results. Multitrack recording together with improvising ability and<br/>general creativity is a strong weapon in doing music.  Besides music<br/>is not only exact pitch selected from 12tone system and exact simple<br/>rhythm, or harmony or polyphony. There&apos;s much more possibilities, and<br/>lot of them is difficult if not impossible to describe in the<br/>standard notation.</p><p>So maybe knowledge of notation slowly disappears, but some new ways<br/>of making music were created. It&apos;s just a development.

Your theoretical skills are<br/>&gt; &gt; clearly very weak, as is evident from your confusion about the key center<br/>&gt; &gt; for the Drei Equale (you were confusing the scale you used for your<br/>&gt; &gt; realization with the tonality of piece, which wasn&apos;t written for JI).<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; No I was not confusing.<br/>&gt; My JI system has something that is best described as tonality, and often<br/>&gt; agrees for the largest part with the normal meaning of tonality in simple<br/>&gt; compositions.<br/>&gt; Drei equale does not agree with beeing in D minor. I belief this is clearly<br/>&gt; an area where normal music theory is lacking and wrong in this case.<br/>&gt; Long story to explain further, but no I don&apos;t agree with what you&apos;re saying.<br/>&gt; And if you&apos;d look into the piece a bit deeper then you&apos;d also see for<br/>&gt; yourself that normal music theory doesn&apos;t much know what to make of drei<br/>&gt; equale in any case.<br/>&gt; To say it does is nonsense. Yes sure you can write wrong things on paper and<br/>&gt; it may or may not later be found to be wrong, but in JI you can&apos;t get away<br/>&gt; with such things as the results are audible.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; It also appears as though  you know much about the history of JI or about<br/>&gt; &gt; other composers&apos; music.  Do you know Ben Johnston&apos;s music? He&apos;s been writing<br/>&gt; &gt; fantastically complex pieces in extended just intonation for the last four<br/>&gt; &gt; decades. Do you know of <a href="http://Plainsound.org">Plainsound.org</a>, the collective of composers<br/>&gt; &gt; working in JI?<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Yes I do know about the history of JI.<br/>&gt; And I&apos;m very well aware of what untill now has been called JI is very very<br/>&gt; flawed.<br/>&gt; I&apos;m trying to do things according to the true meaning of the name, Just<br/>&gt; Intonation, that is to tune perfectly in tune.<br/>&gt; To tune perfectly in tune does not mean that every fifth is 3/2, on of the<br/>&gt; many errors of what has mainly become to be known as JI.<br/>&gt; For those that don&apos;t see my system as JI I&apos;ve called my system Tonal-JI just<br/>&gt; to stop the argument about names, but my system is pure and correct JI.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I also know Ben Johnston&apos;s music. I like it.<br/>&gt; But it&apos;s not very complex in my opinion, and also not in tune, though<br/>&gt; sometimes he gets close in my opinion (because of good ears and writing<br/>&gt; pieces that work in a single tonality it seems to me)<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I wasn&apos;t aware of <a href="http://plainsound.org">plainsound.org</a><br/>&gt; Thanks for the link!<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; How can you claim that your etude is the &quot;First time a piece this complex<br/>&gt; &gt; is in JI&quot;? There must be hundreds, if not thousands of pieces written in JI<br/>&gt; &gt;  or transcriptions of older music in JI. For example, for my performances of<br/>&gt; &gt; Bach suites in extended JI, I&apos;ve made transcriptions of the first three<br/>&gt; &gt; suites in JI so that I can practice with them.  The Drei Equale is actually<br/>&gt; &gt; a fairly simply piece to do in JI--why are you making such inflated claims?<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Yes and I belief just about all those thousands of pieces in JI are wrong.<br/>&gt; The ones that are right are only of very simple music and a very lucky to be<br/>&gt; right. More of a coincidence than otherwise.<br/>&gt; And extended JI is a joke, sorry.<br/>&gt; Please enter the contest and tune drei equale better than me and you win<br/>&gt; Â€100,- if it&apos;s as simple as you say.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; I really take offense at your consigning of all the music whose sound you<br/>&gt; &gt; don&apos;t like under the rubric of &quot;crap&quot;; perhaps this reveals the presence of<br/>&gt; &gt; the &quot;Rush Limbaugh gene&quot; I&apos;ve mentioned earlier.
