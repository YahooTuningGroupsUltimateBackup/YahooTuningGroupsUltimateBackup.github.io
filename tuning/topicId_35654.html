It is rare indeed to save the null active parameter<br/>events to a midi file - in practice hardly any programs do<br/>- but why not; it is only two extra midi events, ok, they<br/>add eight bytes per channel to the length of the midi file<br/>(total of 128 bytes), but no-one is going to mind about<br/>that nowadays :-).</p><p>Robert</p></div>
