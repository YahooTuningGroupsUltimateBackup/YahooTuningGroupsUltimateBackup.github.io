One thing notices, if you read the many reviews, interviews, and writings of the time - if they *aren&apos;t* well-researched - is that they grab onto images and words that make for &quot;good copy&quot;.</p><p>Partch was continually hounded with the spectre of &quot;43 tones to the octave&quot;, as if that was all he was about. But &quot;43&quot; became a common thread. Along with this, the visual nature of the collection of instruments he was gradually adding to were compelling as well, and none more so than the Cloud-Chamber Bowls, a collection of glass &apos;bells&apos; cut from... etc. We&apos;ve all heard the story.</p><p>And, being a percussionist, I&apos;ve gotten used to virtually everything that I play on that happens to have a low-to-high arrangement of objects in a scale of some sort referred to as a &quot;xylophone&quot;. All the time.</p><p>So, I&apos;m surmising that some less-than-anal-retentive author did a loose description of &quot;a crazy California Beat composer, banging away on a glass xylophone in fifty-three flower-power tones to the octave, man!&quot; Or something along that nature.</p><p>Bob, it seems you have a vivid remembrance of this (notice how I didn&apos;t question what condition many of us were in during undergrad studies? :) ), but there are so many reasons that this is some form of either fiction or fuzziness that it really would need to be substantiated.</p><p>I&apos;ll offer one caveat: there was an Industrial Design class that took on a project at the University of Illinois in 1959, whereby they all designed &apos;odd&apos; instruments, under (sort of) Partch&apos;s watchful eye. A description I have, from the photo show we&apos;ve put together -</p><p><a href="http://www.corporeal.com/art_inst/bumshow/">http://www.corporeal.com/art_inst/bumshow/</a></p><p>- is of a photo of some of the student inventors. It goes something like this:</p><p>&quot;One of the oddest photo groupings in the collection, this unlikely group are members of the Industrial Design curriculum at the school while Partch was still on campus. The object of their project was straight-forward: to create musical instruments from materials at hand in an imaginative, resourceful way. The instructor felt that too many of the students were unduly influenced by a visit to Partch&apos;s studio over the Co-Ed Theater, and imitated rather than innovated. Nonetheless, the most promising instruments were left in Partch&apos;s keeping for his use, and it is through this project that Partch gained two very unique instruments, the mono-stringed glissando instrument Cry-Chord, and the bubbling percolations of the Mazda Marimba, the sound-producing elements of which were constructed entirely of gutted light bulbs.&quot;</p><p>It is tantalizing to wonder what future Partch concerts would have been like had he hung onto the most striking instrument developed: the Flame Organ. This spectacular contraption was a group of metal tubes heated from beneath by burning gas jets; when a screen was removed, the result was a weird, moaning sound like a lost soul on the moors. Duet on the Flame Organ and Blo-Boy, anyone?&quot;</p><p>More than enough for one night, yes?</p><p>Cheers,<br/>Jon</p></div><h3><a id=37875 href="#37875">ðŸ”—</a>robert_wendell &#x3C;rwendell@cangelic.org&#x3E;</h3><span>6/18/2002 9:59:07 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Well, in &apos;63-&apos;64 as a college sophomore or junior in Tennessee I had<br/>never even so much as smoked a joint.

I<br/>&gt; &gt; don&apos;t have a clear memory of what the man in the photo looked<br/>like,<br/>&gt; &gt; since at that time I had not previously heard of Partch and<br/>didn&apos;t<br/>&gt; &gt; run into his image again until literally decades later.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I&apos;m certainly going to run this by one other noted Partch scholar,<br/>Dr. Philip Blackburn, since he deals a lot with the historical<br/>publications (I myself just got an issue of &quot;Pageant&quot; magazine from<br/>1959 that has a pretty hilarious send-up of Partch.</p><p>Bob:<br/>Great!

I believe there is something deep and intrinsically<br/>powerful and even healing about pure JI intervals. I don&apos;t think it&apos;s<br/>simply a matter of taste and relativistic esthetics.</p><p>I think something more is going on. Something fundamentally sound (if<br/>you&apos;ll pardon the inadvertent punning) about the coherence and<br/>simple, clean relationships that has a celestially pleasing esthetic<br/>effect, especially on those sensitive to it, and likely an even<br/>deeper, more objective effect on the psychophysiology that is<br/>conducive to health and wholeness of being.</p><p>On the other hand, I think that getting overly picky about a cent or<br/>two is unwarranted except in a purely exploratory, theoretical<br/>context or where small errors accumulate to cause greater problems<br/>elsewhere and damage overall integrity. However, I believe there is<br/>a &quot;bandwidth&quot;, if you will, to justness and that it lies, by the most<br/>conservative estimate, somehere around the sub-2- or 3-cent ballpark<br/>on either side of just. On this basis, in another post today I<br/>explain my motives, with a detailed illustrative sample, for choosing<br/>a quasi-JI tempered scale.<br/>&gt;<br/>Jon earlier:<br/>&gt; The other important point that I think a lot of people forget (or<br/>miss) is that Partch The Theoretician was pretty much done with<br/>thinking about these matters by the end of the 40&apos;s, and was well<br/>into putting the stuff into practice.

I heard a professional orchestral<br/>musician/professor give a lecture once on intonation in which he<br/>declared professional musicians generally cannot detect errors of<br/>less than 10 cents in a performance context(as opposed to a tuning<br/>one). I thought that was way high then and still do, but that should<br/>provide some sense of the range of opinions on this issue even<br/>among &quot;qualified&quot; professionals.</p></div>
