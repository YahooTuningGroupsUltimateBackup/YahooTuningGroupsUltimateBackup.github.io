I<br/>understand the basics of how this could be applied to individual<br/>timbres, but the really big question in my mind is how can you apply<br/>this theory to tuning multi-part music that has multiple timbres with<br/>radically different harmonic structures. I&apos;ve been curious to<br/>understand, that if for instance you have metal instruments tuned to<br/>optimum scales for their harmonic structure, and you have strings<br/>tuned to their best, as well as a number of others, then how will<br/>this all sound when it&apos;s mixed together. I&apos;ve pondered if there may<br/>be some way to apply his ideas to a sum of the overtone structures<br/>being used - where all of the harmonic structures of the music are<br/>considered as a whole, from which to derive a best ensemble scale.<br/>Surely this is mainly for the electronic music domain - makes one<br/>think that you would have to have some serious ability to analyize<br/>timbre as well as mold new timbres electronically. Based on the mp3s<br/>I&apos;ve heard from Mr. Sethares, it can be a very beautiful sound. Of<br/>particular interest to me was the piece all based on percussion<br/>overtones. Very beautiful!!! (sorry can&apos;t recall the title just now).</p><p>Later,</p><p>Jacky Ligon</p><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@egroups.com">tuning@egroups.com</a>, &quot;Joseph Pehrson&quot; &lt;pehrson@p...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt; No sooner had I gone through some of the exciting stuff that Ed<br/>&gt; Borasky directed me to, and Mr. Sethares contacted me *HIMSELF.*<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Someone is doing a real &quot;fast one&quot; here on the Tuning List.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Wow.
