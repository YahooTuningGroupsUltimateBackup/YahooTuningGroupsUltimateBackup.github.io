The machines focus on the partials<br/>because the fundamentals are less important, from the standpoint of control,<br/>than the partials, which beat a lot faster when tempering.  Within<br/>non-perceptible changes in the fundamentals, a tuner can alter partials to create a wide<br/>variety of tempering,(an endeavor of some attraction to the afflicted few).<br/>    Also,  the piano&apos;s partials are not all perfectly consistant.  You will<br/>often notice small numbers on the piano plates, under the strings. The top<br/>notes will be 13, then perhaps six notes later 13.5, then 14,  and so on.  These<br/>are diameter changes, made in an attempt to keep the tension progressing evenly<br/>higher as the strings get longer and the pitch gets lower.  This pattern of<br/>wire sizes and string lengths is known as the &quot;scaling&quot; of that piano.  It<br/>takes into account the impedance of the soundboard and size of piano to attempt a<br/>balanced, even, response in loudness and sustain, while still producing a<br/>musical set of intervals.<br/>    The tension in a string determines the amount of inharmonicity, and when<br/>you have 6 or 8 notes in a row with the same size wire, you will have a change<br/>in tension,(thus inharmonicity) whereever they another size wire.  At the<br/>point where it changes sizes, the highest tension first note will be next to the<br/>lowest tension last note of the preceding wire size.  This makes the partials<br/>land all over the chart.  The tuner&apos;s job is to compromise things enough.  We<br/>have to work among the partials to do this, and when doing so, the fundamental<br/>is rarely the prime consideration.<br/>Regards,<br/>Ed Foote<br/><a href="http://www.uk-piano.org/edfoote/">www.uk-piano.org/edfoote/</a><br/><a href="http://www.uk-piano.org/edfoote/well_tempered_piano.html">www.uk-piano.org/edfoote/well_tempered_piano.html</a><br/> &lt;A HREF=&quot;<a href="http://artists.mp3s.com/artists/399/six_degrees_of_tonality.html">http://artists.mp3s.com/artists/399/six_degrees_of_tonality.html</a>&quot;&gt;<br/><a href="http://MP3.com">MP3.com</a>: Six Degrees of Tonality&lt;/A&gt;</p></div><h3><a id=44298 href="#44298">ðŸ”—</a>Jon Szanto &#x3C;JSZANTO@ADNC.COM&#x3E;</h3><span>6/8/2003 8:47:10 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;wallyesterpaulrus&quot; &lt;wallyesterpaulrus@y...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt; while the harmonic series isn&apos;t simply &quot;stretched&quot;, it&apos;s still<br/>&gt; almost identical from bell to bell.</p><p>Ahem, are you *sure* on this one?

My *favorite* bell of all time is the<br/>one sitting inside the Kremlin.  There is a huge bell there, maybe 15<br/>feet high, just sitting on the ground.  It was the engineering<br/>miscalculation of all time.  The bell was too heavy to put in the<br/>cathedral structure and somehow they found out too late, so it just<br/>sits there, and they cut a side out of it so that tourists could go<br/>inside there...</p><p>JP</p></div>
