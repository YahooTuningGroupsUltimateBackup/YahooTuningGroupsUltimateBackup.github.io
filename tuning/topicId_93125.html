So just for the record, this is just the model I<br/>propose and am exploring for now, for anyone who is interested:</p><p>I believe that<br/>1) Minorness is dissonance, in small doses. The sound of fingernails<br/>on a chalk board is dissonance, in larger doses. The sound of a dom7#9<br/>Hendrix chord is dissonance, in smaller doses.<br/>2) Dissonance really does boil down to entropic discordance; at least<br/>the kind that causes minorness.<br/>3) 4:5:6:7:8:9:10:11:... has a very strong field of attraction, as<br/>does 1/1 and 2/1 in dyadic entropy.<br/>4) By deliberately detuning this sonority to find areas of dissonance,<br/>we can bypass the HE model completely and go right to the listening<br/>test part.<br/>5) If you do this carefully, and put your &quot;artist&quot; hat on while you do<br/>it, you can &quot;design&quot; sonorities that have a certain amount of &quot;pain&quot;<br/>in them.<br/>6) I believe that a significant part of musical feeling or meaning and<br/>even &quot;musical consonance&quot; comes from the careful placement of this<br/>&quot;pain,&quot; in carefully designed quantities, and resolving it to less (or<br/>more) pain. This is a restatement of #1.<br/>7) There are chords &quot;equivalent&quot; in sadness to minor that do not have<br/>minor thirds in them, some examples of which I have given; whether<br/>this will hold for impartial listeners has yet to be determined. It<br/>may be that they need to be placed in a musical context for the<br/>&quot;sadness&quot; to come through, which from a psychoacoustic perspective<br/>means that a shifting of the &quot;pain&quot; may be what causes the emotion.<br/>8) The &quot;depriming interval&quot; is a concept I have abandoned entirely,<br/>and think that it boils down to n-adic discordance.<br/>9) I need to work my generalization of HE out before anything useful<br/>can come out of this at all.<br/>10) I think that cognitive and learned factors can override all of<br/>this, and they function as a way of &quot;pre-priming&quot; the auditory system<br/>(part of what leads to musical &quot;expectation&quot;). Feeling can come from<br/>this as well.</p><p>I invite anyone interested to message me offlist to flesh this out<br/>more. Otherwise, I&apos;d just like to thank everyone again for the<br/>critical feedback so far (Carl, Igs, Michael, Gene, Cameron, etc). But<br/>at this point I need to take a hiatus, at least from this subject and<br/>publicly on this list. I&apos;m not sure how much time I&apos;ll have to post<br/>from Haiti anyway, so this might be goodbye for a little bit.</p><p>Peace</p><p>-Mike</p></div><h3><a id=93130 href="#93130">ðŸ”—</a>genewardsmith &#x3C;genewardsmith@...&#x3E;</h3><span>9/20/2010 11:25:15 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, Mike Battaglia &lt;battaglia01@...&gt; wrote:</p><p>&gt; 1) Minorness is dissonance, in small doses.

I think that<br/>as you get sharper than the 12-tet third, itdoes pass into a region of<br/>something like sadness (to the extent that the lower noot and not the<br/>VF is established as the root), and I think that&apos;s significant. You<br/>yourself have said you hear supermajor triads sometimes as being<br/>&quot;sad.&quot; The effect is noticeably more prominent with supermajor 7<br/>chords vs JI 5-limit major 7 chords, and 9/7 may not be the ideal<br/>third for the particular mixture of consonance and dissonance one<br/>might call something like &quot;sadness,&quot; being slightly on the dissonant<br/>side methinks.

I&apos;d like to hear some more input from you on the subject, since I suspect you might have some helpful ideas.</p><p>So far, I&apos;ve found within my own personal experience counter-examples to every theory of &quot;minorness&quot; that I can conceive.  6:7:9 is another example that I find to disagree with the utonality theory, and even Gene described that chord as &quot;otonal but minor&quot;.  Mike&apos;s theory suggests that major chords are sort of &quot;islands of relief in a sea of pain&quot;, and that minor chords might be the &quot;shores&quot; of those islands, which seems to describe his experience but not mine.  Sharpening the 5 in a 4:5:6 doesn&apos;t lead toward minorness in my hearing.</p><p>I came up with two theories that I kept to myself, because I swiftly found counter-examples.  One of these was that minorness is simply a property of certain psychoacoustic identities, like 6/5 or 7/6 (but hearing that 5:6:7 could sound major when compared to its utonal counterpart scrapped that theory).  From this followed another theory, that major and minor are comparative qualities, not inherent qualities.  I suspected that in comparing two triads with the same lowest and highest notes but differing middle notes, the chord with the lower middle note would sound &quot;minor&quot; compared to the chord with the higher middle note.  This held up well until I compared an 8:9:12 chord to a 6:7:9 chord, and heard the latter as more minor.  At this point I threw up my hands and decided to take a sort of Taoist view, that in all minor there is an amount of major, and in all major there is an amount of minor, and all are really one since all are contained within the harmonic series.</p><p>But then I thought: &quot;from whence comes my &apos;bias&apos; that allows me to distinguish even alien chords as sounding &apos;major&apos; or &apos;minor&apos;?&quot;  Then I got flustered, and now I&apos;m writing to you.</p><p>What is &quot;minor&quot;, in your estimation of it, and do you think there&apos;s any way to link the phenomenon of &quot;minorness&quot; with a specific set of psychoacoustic identities?  Or are we all fools for demanding of the universe an explanation for something that occurs inside our own minds?</p><p>-Igs</p><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;cameron&quot; &lt;misterbobro@...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I&apos;d suggest right away forgetting the o/u-tonal stuff. 16:19:24 is otonal and it sure isn&apos;t major.

I already said that. With that nearly perfect 3:2 in there... But surely you agree that it&apos;s NOT a harmonic structure, not unless we stretch the definition of &quot;(sub)harmonic structure&quot; quite a bit to include that 12-tET M3 (81/64? 19/15? 131/104?). So, though we can fairly say that the spectrum of a major triad in 12-tET reasonably resolved or understood as if it were a harmonic structure, that is, we could say that the overall inharmonicity created by that irrational interval stuck in the middle isn&apos;t strong enough to destroy the simple resolutions and understandings we&apos;d have in a harmonic structure, it nevertheless remains true that it is NOT a harmonic structure. Therefore, we simply cannot say that this structure is major, rooted, or wears a cloisonn&eacute; codpiece, or whatever! BECAUSE of so-and-so properties of harmonic structures.</p><p>A specific example: we can&apos;t describe harmonic-series and (psycho)acoustic properties of 5:4 and then just tack them onto the 12-tET M3.  Like this:</p><p>1. 5:4 generally exhibits little to no audible beating. (simple observation, accurate).<br/>2. An interval exhibiting little to no audible beating sounds &quot;calm&quot;. (completely reasonable statement, as long as it is understood that &quot;calm&quot; is going to create varied subjective responses).<br/>3. Therefore 5:4 sounds &quot;calm&quot;. (Fine. We can argue or disagree on the artistic level about this, but we&apos;ve got a reasoned positivistic description).</p><p>Now here unfortunately is what happens next:</p><p>4. 5:4 is a major third. (This floats, we could hardly have any discussion without acceptance of historical definitions).<br/>5. 5:4 is calm (from 1,2,3- fine).<br/>6. 400 cents is a major third. (Okay).<br/>7. Therefore, 400 cents sounds calm. (Bzzzzzzztt)</p><p>You can repeat the &quot;reasoning&quot; including difference tones, character descriptions, and so on.</p><p>It looks absolutely absurd spelled out like this, but this is a very good description of the &quot;reasoning&quot; that appears in textbooks and elsewhere. Check it out in Stil und Gedanke, in that absurd book on symmetries by Lendavi, and so on. Happens all the time.</p><p>-Cameron</p><p>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; Anyway that&apos;s missing the point: the point is, there is no concrete<br/>&gt; &gt; explanation for its rootedness.

I&apos;d like to hear some more input from you on the subject, since I suspect you might have some helpful ideas.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; So far, I&apos;ve found within my own personal experience counter-examples to every theory of &quot;minorness&quot; that I can conceive.  6:7:9 is another example that I find to disagree with the utonality theory, and even Gene described that chord as &quot;otonal but minor&quot;.  Mike&apos;s theory suggests that major chords are sort of &quot;islands of relief in a sea of pain&quot;, and that minor chords might be the &quot;shores&quot; of those islands, which seems to describe his experience but not mine.  Sharpening the 5 in a 4:5:6 doesn&apos;t lead toward minorness in my hearing.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I came up with two theories that I kept to myself, because I swiftly found counter-examples.  One of these was that minorness is simply a property of certain psychoacoustic identities, like 6/5 or 7/6 (but hearing that 5:6:7 could sound major when compared to its utonal counterpart scrapped that theory).  From this followed another theory, that major and minor are comparative qualities, not inherent qualities.  I suspected that in comparing two triads with the same lowest and highest notes but differing middle notes, the chord with the lower middle note would sound &quot;minor&quot; compared to the chord with the higher middle note.  This held up well until I compared an 8:9:12 chord to a 6:7:9 chord, and heard the latter as more minor.  At this point I threw up my hands and decided to take a sort of Taoist view, that in all minor there is an amount of major, and in all major there is an amount of minor, and all are really one since all are contained within the harmonic series.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; But then I thought: &quot;from whence comes my &apos;bias&apos; that allows me to distinguish even alien chords as sounding &apos;major&apos; or &apos;minor&apos;?&quot;  Then I got flustered, and now I&apos;m writing to you.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; What is &quot;minor&quot;, in your estimation of it, and do you think there&apos;s any way to link the phenomenon of &quot;minorness&quot; with a specific set of psychoacoustic identities?  Or are we all fools for demanding of the universe an explanation for something that occurs inside our own minds?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; -Igs<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; --- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;cameron&quot; &lt;misterbobro@&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; I&apos;d suggest right away forgetting the o/u-tonal stuff. 16:19:24 is otonal and it sure isn&apos;t major.

So, though we can fairly say that the<br/>spectrum of a major triad in 12-tET reasonably resolved or understood<br/>as if it were a harmonic structure, that is, we could say that the<br/>overall inharmonicity created by that irrational interval stuck in<br/>the middle isn&apos;t strong enough to destroy the simple resolutions and<br/>understandings we&apos;d have in a harmonic structure, it nevertheless<br/>remains true that it is NOT a harmonic structure.

An interval exhibiting little to no audible beating sounds<br/>&quot;calm&quot;.

(This floats, we could hardly have any<br/>discussion without acceptance of historical definitions).<br/>&gt; 5. 5:4 is calm (from 1,2,3- fine).<br/>&gt; 6. 400 cents is a major third. (Okay).<br/>&gt; 7. Therefore, 400 cents sounds calm.

Nevertheless, whatever we call it, it is there.</p><p>That which we call rising and falling IS universal, it would happen in birdsong even if the last human were to have left the earth for elsewhere.

I did notice, however, that you used quotation marks<br/>&gt; around the word universal. Still, it seems like this discussion could use<br/>&gt; better terminology on this front. Maybe &quot;music-generating parameters&quot; (I<br/>&gt; don&apos;t think it&apos;s too much of a stretch to call generated harmonic<br/>&gt; progressions &quot;music&quot; in a mostly true sense) or whatever it is we&apos;re talking<br/>&gt; about here.
