During my somewhat busy and distracted schedule this month, I<br/>have unfortunately confused the date of the extended deadline -<br/>thinking the contest was going to end on the 21st. Silly me being so<br/>absent minded. That and some minor problems with prolonged lack of<br/>concentration and mental slowness... If it is not yet too late to post<br/>the &quot;thus-far-ready&quot; two pieces I have been working on using the<br/>Ethno2 sounds, here is a quick link to them:</p><p><a href="http://www.ozanyarman.com/misc/nisabureynpesrev_ethno2.mp3">www.ozanyarman.com/misc/nisabureynpesrev_ethno2.mp3</a><br/><a href="http://www.ozanyarman.com/misc/Sultansofthedance_ethno2.mp3">www.ozanyarman.com/misc/Sultansofthedance_ethno2.mp3</a></p><p>The first piece is an incomplete intro of my now-famous Nishabureyn<br/>Peshrev utilizing three 12-tone tuning tables. The instruments used<br/>are Indian Flute v2 (to imitate the ney), Oud, Veena (to imitate the<br/>tanbur with much tweaking), Dilruba (to resemble the bowed tanbur),<br/>Santur 2, Maghreb Violins and the usual array of percussions like<br/>bendirs, darbukas, etc...</p><p>The scales used in succession throughout the minute are:</p><p>|<br/> 16/15<br/> 9/8<br/> 32/27<br/> 32/25<br/> 7/5<br/> 17/12<br/> 3/2<br/> 8/5<br/> 128/75<br/> 16/9<br/> 48/25<br/> 2/1</p><p>|<br/> 16/15<br/> 9/8<br/> 32/27<br/> 81/64<br/> 4/3<br/> 17/12<br/> 3/2<br/> 8/5<br/> 27/16<br/> 16/9<br/> 48/25<br/> 2/1</p><p>|<br/> 16/15<br/> 9/8<br/> 6/5<br/> 320/243<br/> 4/3<br/> 17/12<br/> 405/256<br/> 8/5<br/> 5/3<br/> 27/16<br/> 256/135<br/> 2/1</p><p>This piece is hardly complete, due mostly to my inability to work with<br/>the 24-tone tuning tables in Ethno2 and my computer system frequently<br/>overloading with the 12-tone replica-instruments setup. In any case,<br/>the intro fits the minimum 50 seconds requirement. With some more<br/>effort and patience, and if I am given the oppurtunity to do so, I would like to conclude the Ethno2 rendition of the Nishabureyn Peshrev<br/>in the near future.</p><p>The second piece, again half-complete, and missing at the moment the<br/>most important (and gorgeous) microtonal melody part in the not-<br/>included second minute section, is a grandiose rehash of my &quot;Sultans<br/>of The Dance&quot; intro demo song which I had composed in 2001. It was not used back then for certain reasons and I grabbed the oppurtunity to<br/>prepare a re-make using the beautiful sounds of Ethno2.</p><p>A rescued (but a little damaged) recording from those days where I<br/>amateurisly dared to haphazardly pitch-bend the notes to acquire that<br/>wonderful Karjighar melody can be heard here:</p><p><a href="http://www.ozanyarman.com/misc/Sultan.mp3">www.ozanyarman.com/misc/Sultan.mp3</a></p><p>It is a pity that I couldn&apos;t complete it in time, but it should be<br/>understandable since brass sounds (trombones, horns, trumpets) are<br/>absent in Ethno2 and I had to combine several akin instruments<br/>cleverly to imitate a huge brass section and even a make-shift clarinet!</p><p>The scales so far used are, a Segah-Rast type tuning and Comptine<br/>according to Jacques&apos; formulation:</p><p>|<br/> 14/13<br/> 9/8<br/> 75/64<br/> 210/169<br/> 4/3<br/> 56/39<br/> 3/2<br/> 128/81<br/> 280/169<br/> 16/9<br/> 315/169<br/> 2/1</p><p>|<br/> 256/243<br/> 21995/19683<br/> 32/27<br/> 8192/6561<br/> 4/3<br/> 1024/729<br/> 9808/6561<br/> 128/81<br/> 10960/6561<br/> 16/9<br/> 4096/2187<br/> 2/1</p><p>The projected Nadhaswaram Karjighar tune will rely on this 12-tone<br/>tuning of mine based on Comptine:</p><p>|<br/> 14/13<br/> 800/729<br/> 32/27<br/> 210/169<br/> 4/3<br/> 56/39<br/> 3/2<br/> 128/81<br/> 280/169<br/> 16/9<br/> 315/169<br/> 2/1</p><p>Instruments thus far used in &quot;Sultan&quot;: Piano Bastringue, Amazona5,<br/>Chimes1, Triangle2, Addiction (warped to produce a Clarinet timbre),<br/>Balkanish Saxophone (to reinforce the Clarinet timbre), Chamber<br/>Machine, Wait in Space, Grand Canyon, Lost Impression, Ominous Pad,<br/>Magreb Violin+Strings, Typical Jupiter /Brassy Mood /Bright Analogic<br/>(combo tweaked for Full Brass effect), Gu 1 Bass, Aboriginal Perc<br/>Bass, Chinese Gong 14.5&quot; / Cambodian Gong 18&quot;  1&amp;2 / Belltree<br/>(hardpanned duo), Shakers Rolls (hardpanned duo)... and more to come<br/>if I can get it complete.</p><p>Once again, I would very much like to finish this piece too in the<br/>near future using Ethno2. I hope to be given such an oppurtunity if it<br/>is possible.</p><p>My apologies for being so absent minded and neglectful with the dates.<br/>I hope everybody will understand.</p><p>Don&apos;t forget to vote for the &quot;Son Bir Kez&quot; H&uuml;zzam Sharki!</p><p>Cordially,<br/>Dr. Oz.</p><p>&#x2729; &#x2729; &#x2729;<br/><a href="http://www.ozanyarman.com">www.ozanyarman.com</a></p><p>On Jul 20, 2010, at 1:43 AM, Jacques Dudon wrote:</p><p>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;
