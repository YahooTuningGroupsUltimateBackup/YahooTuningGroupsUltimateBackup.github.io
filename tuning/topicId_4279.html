In fact,<br/>the Anaphorian Creation of the Worlds (which you have) is similarly constructed<br/>with an eight tone cycle  found in  complementary dekanies. I find it melodic</p><p>&quot;Paul H.

The surface has barely<br/>&gt; been scratched; fugues, etc. need to be written.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;I ask because a piece of mine, _Pequod, for Lou Harrison_ (1986) used<br/>&gt; &gt;complementary dekanies from the (1,3,5,7,9,11) and (1,3,7,9,11,15)<br/>&gt; &gt;eikosanies, for example, the dekany<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;1*3*11, 1*5*11, 1*7*11, 1*9*11, 3*5*11, 3*7*11, 3*9*11, 5*7*11, 5*9*11,<br/>&gt; &gt;7*9*11 was contrasted<br/>&gt; &gt;with<br/>&gt; &gt;1*3*5, 1*3*7, 1*3*9, 1*5*7, 1*5*9, 1*7*9, 3*5*7, 3*5*9, 3*7*9, 5*7*9<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;I found that each dekany collection was coherent, but not as a scale.<br/>&gt; &gt;Although each had a regular pattern of scale steps,<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; That&apos;s a stretch! Compare the regularity of having two identical pentachords<br/>&gt; within all 10 octave species of the pentachordal decatonic scale, or the<br/>&gt; distributional evenness of the symmetrical decatonic scale. What&apos;s the<br/>&gt; neatest decription you can come up with for the &quot;regularity&quot; of the pattern<br/>&gt; of scale steps in the dekanies?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;they were too dense to<br/>&gt; &gt;function akin to a diatonic or pentatonic scale  or not dense and even<br/>&gt; enough<br/>&gt; &gt;to function like a chromatic scale.  Instead, subsets of each dekany seemed<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;to form the most important local melodic units and the dekany as a whole<br/>&gt; &gt;formed the collection or pool of harmonic resources.  I am fond of the<br/>&gt; &gt;ambiguous character of the dekanies, but just can&apos;t call them scales.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; They&apos;re certainly not melodic entities.</p><p>-- Kraig Grady<br/>North American Embassy of Anaphoria Island<br/><a href="http://www.anaphoria.com">http://www.anaphoria.com</a></p></div>
