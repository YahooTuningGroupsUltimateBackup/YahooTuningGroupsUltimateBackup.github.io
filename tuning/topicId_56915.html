And that takes care, not to break it or bend<br/>&gt;it too much. I have one here and did it, part of one afternoon, carefully<br/>&gt;taking out each black key and bending its &quot;tangent&quot; (a piece of metal)<br/>&gt;slightly sideways, to hit the new right place on the strings.</p><p>This is only true of &quot;fretted&quot; clavichords.</p><p>I imagine you&apos;re familiar with Kellner&apos;s &quot;Bach&quot; tuning?</p><p><a href="http://ha.kellner.bei.t-online.de/">http://ha.kellner.bei.t-online.de/</a></p><p>Oh, I see from your 2nd FAQ page that you are.

Had a<br/>chance just now to read John Charles Francis&apos; &quot;The Esoteric Keyboard<br/>Temperaments of J.S. Bach&quot; from his website.  I tried to find the issue of Early Music<br/>to see what Bradley Lehman was proclaiming, but maybe Patelson&apos;s has it.</p><p>To summarize, there are a bunch of wiggles drawn above the Bach manuscript of<br/>the Well-Tempered Clavier.  These wiggles are of different natural sizes, but<br/>with some contiguous ones drawn in.  This is seen as representing beats per<br/>second.  The furthest white wiggle, touches the &quot;C&quot; of &quot;Clavier&quot; which is to<br/>designate the intent.</p><p>My sense is that this is a bit precious.  Even if there was an indication<br/>drawn through several mathematical maneuvers.</p><p>My views on Bach have evolved over the years, each time it is a very exciting<br/>time.  Re-reading C.P.E. Bach, I now get the sense he is protecting something<br/>that is a secret of his family tradition.  If it was to be revealed, he would<br/>have done it.  But that tradition could be Werckmeister III chromatic as<br/>easily as any other.</p><p>Bradley Lehman tells me there are some defiantly anti-Werckmeister III works<br/>penned by JS Bach in some kind of deadpan humor, but I am skeptical: Because<br/>every key works in Werckmeister III.  That is in fact what is most spectacular<br/>about it.  Werckmeister III is the first published circular chromatic tuning<br/>for keyboards, and music in general, and it was put into practice by some<br/>prominent composers and builders before his generation of composers.  Done deal.</p><p>Thing is: Bach did not go up against the tuning of his time.  If it was<br/>Werckmeister III, as I believe, then Bach&apos;s forcing a &quot;changed&quot; tuning...would get<br/>some unwanted attention.  The status quo does usually get special attention<br/>(the squeeky wheel gets the grease).</p><p>Each of the Bach cities has a Werckmeister reference mark; a Werckmeister<br/>student--and JS Bach cousin--Johann Walther brings JS to Weimar, Wender&apos;s builds<br/>an organ in Arnstadt in his favorite tuning (that of Werckmeister<br/>III-according to Kuhnau) and JS takes over as organist, works in Wender&apos;s home town of<br/>Muelhausen (succeeding Ahle who was the clearest of the Werckmeister besmitten),<br/>trudged off to hang overtime with Werckmeister&apos;s declared friend Buxtehude,<br/>and succeeded Werckmeister-knowledgeable Kuhnau in Leipzig. This correspondence<br/>would seem to indicate a promenence of Werckmeister&apos;s chromatic in these<br/>specific Bach city locations.  Admittedly, this is largely connected by inference.<br/>Let me infer further that I will be curious to read Bradley&apos;s paper armed by<br/>Charles&apos;s cautionaries (which include insufficient attribution) as soon as it<br/>is possible.</p><p>best, Johnny Reinhard</p></div><h3>bachjohann_sebastian &#x3C;Francis@datacomm.ch&#x3E;</h3><span>2/14/2005 9:47:42 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Dear Johnny Reinhard</p><p>I always enjoy your spot on the WKCR Bachfest each year and make a<br/>point of tuning in on the Internet.

That&apos;s a central point of my paper.  There are<br/>two halves to it, February (current) and the next issue in May, plus<br/>an additional 50+ pages of mathematical analysis.  The paper as<br/>submitted to Oxford last June was more than twice as long as their<br/>normal articles, and so they have divided it into two portions along<br/>with (forthcoming) supplementary web materials on their own site.</p><p>&gt; Let me infer further that I will be curious to read Bradley&apos;s paper<br/>armed by<br/>&gt; Charles&apos;s cautionaries (which include insufficient attribution) as<br/>soon as it<br/>&gt; is possible.</p><p>Thanks, Johnny.  But also--keep in mind that Charles&apos;s &quot;review&quot; which<br/>he has posted on at least six internet groups so far (that I know<br/>about), about insufficient attribution and such and such and such,<br/>has served to insert additional skepticism into your mind *before*<br/>reading my paper.  It probably also inserts such doubt into the minds<br/>of some who will simply take his word for things *instead of* reading<br/>my paper.</p><p>At least in part, I take it as a personal and frivolous attack<br/>against my ability to have written this paper at all, and an attack<br/>against the validity of Oxford&apos;s editorial process of peer review.<br/>My paper indeed has been checked out, pre-publication, with more than<br/>a dozen experts of the material: at both my initiative and in<br/>Oxford&apos;s normal editorial process before accepting papers.  That<br/>testing process on my results included, _inter alia_, extensive<br/>concert use of my proposed solution by two professional Baroque<br/>orchestras, a Swiss radio broadcast of a solo keyboard performance by<br/>Dr Robert Hill, and the building of my solution into a new pipe<br/>organ.  That latter project included two-month study of my complete<br/>manuscript by a respected firm specializing in unequal temperament<br/>pipe organs.  They took my manuscript along on a study trip to<br/>Germany, examining the work of Bach&apos;s colleague Hildebrandt, before<br/>deciding to proceed with implementing my proposed tuning methods into<br/>their own work.</p><p>I believe that Charles&apos;s present &quot;review&quot;, at least in part, is an<br/>act of personal spite by him.  Last spring when he heard that I was<br/>working on this paper, he asked probing questions about it that I<br/>declined to answer, as to the material that is in my paper.  He then<br/>set out to derive (i.e. guess at) my results for himself, putting<br/>together two papers of his own that did not go through any expert<br/>peer review before what he calls &quot;publication&quot;, rushing them both out<br/>to appear before mine, as background to his present frivolous claims<br/>in judgment of my work.  In these two papers he guessed at 148<br/>different temperaments, none of which happen to coincide with my<br/>findings, basing his guesses on two different Bach sources (namely,<br/>an esoteric reading of BWV 924 and the drawing on the WTC title page)<br/>which he had some reason to believe might be cited in my paper.  And,<br/>his complaint is now that my results do not agree with his arbitrary<br/>metrics!</p><p>The connection to any Sparschuh material (which was the concept that<br/>the Bach drawing is *somehow* meaningful, but beyond that having<br/>nothing to do with my results) was fully documented in my manuscript.<br/>Charles&apos;s complaint amounts to his personal disappointment that my<br/>citation of that is not in some place that he expects it to be.  He&apos;s<br/>complaining about *his expectations* that my work should look<br/>different from the way it does, at the end of seven months of<br/>editorial processing by the Oxford staff to decide which portions go<br/>into the two printed halves, and which portions only into their own<br/>web supplementary materials.  I additionally documented S-Z and its<br/>application on my own separate web site,<br/><a href="http://www.larips.com">http://www.larips.com</a><br/>, which see.</p><p>Charles evidently did not look at that web site of mine before<br/>writing his review, although it has been available there on the web<br/>since mid-January as an introduction to my work.  This web site, too,<br/>has been studied for several weeks by expert colleagues of mine whom<br/>I trust (and personally requested) to give me fair and honest<br/>constructive criticism about it, and that process has already led to<br/>some improvements in it.  My primary concern here is of course<br/>accuracy to the material, and presentation of the work at multiple<br/>levels so it may be understood both by academic and non-academic<br/>readers.</p><p>My Oxford materials include the presentation and technical analysis<br/>of more than forty different temperaments, including S-Z and other<br/>20th century derivations, and temperaments in Bach&apos;s milieu.  Indeed,<br/>as part of the paper I have developed metrics of my own (seen<br/>especially in part 2 in May) that demonstrate my proposed Bach<br/>solution in its proper mathematical and historical contexts.  I have<br/>also used mathematical metrics that were published by Bach&apos;s own<br/>colleague, Sorge, a fellow member of the Mizler society.  These are<br/>seen on page 9 of the article (part 1), and discussed both in<br/>Oxford&apos;s web materials and more extensively on my own web site.<br/>Obviously, part of my goal in this has been to present *valid*<br/>mathematical concepts to clarify the musical and technical issues in<br/>tuning.</p><p>Dr Bradley Lehman, A.Mus.D.<br/>(Harpsichord, 1994, University of Michigan)<br/>...with an earlier B.A. in both mathematics and music</p><p><a href="http://www.larips.com">http://www.larips.com</a></p></div><h3>Afmmjr@aol.com</h3><span>2/15/2005 8:25:28 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>In a message dated 2/15/2005 10:17:30 AM Eastern Standard Time, <a href="mailto:bpl@umich.edu">bpl@umich.edu</a><br/>writes:<br/>I agree that CPE was protecting a family tradition.

Indeed<br/>knowing it is in 2 parts is troubling as I would prefer to read all of the<br/>material together.  The subject is thriller enough for me not to have a &quot;..to be<br/>continued&quot; paper.  I will be fair, decidedly so.  The importance I put behind<br/>Bach&apos;s tuning is of utmost importance.  There are enormous ramifications.</p><p>However, about CPE&apos;s terse single-paragraph &quot;direction&quot; on tuning a keyboard.<br/> It stinks!  Certainly he could have been more specific than he was.  &quot;Most&quot;<br/>indeed.  CPE certainly had to match the tuning of his employer, Frederick the<br/>Great, which was extended (sixth comma) meantone.  When the keyboard was<br/>playing soloistically, something Frederick disdained and which CPE relished, it<br/>didn&apos;t really matter what kind of well temperament he used if every one could<br/>match it.  I&apos;m not sure the oboes and clarinets, and bassoons were so flexible as<br/>to match a new tuning Every Time they played a composer.</p><p>I think CPE, like Johann Philipp Kirnberger, needed a different tuning than<br/>that of JS Bach.  Music was galant, it was melody over harmony, no longer<br/>contrapuntal, no longer for organists...  Rather than separate themselves from him<br/>in a clear way, they sought to show independence of thought in a sniffling<br/>way.  I see great fun in wheezing out different interpretations of manuscript<br/>writing.  Did JS definitely draw those wiggles, himself?</p><p>best, Johnny Reinhard</p></div>
