They are a great resource. I will be<br/>linking to them from the Sagittal home page.</p><p>But there&apos;s a problem with your mixed-sagittal notation of some chords. When<br/>there is both a sagittal and a conventional against the same note, they should<br/>not be separated by a large gap or by any part of an accidental on a different<br/>note. The intention is that the combination of accidentals against one note<br/>should almost appear to be a single composite accidental. The first place this<br/>occurs is with your Ab major triad. You have interleaved them as /|/|bb when<br/>they should be /|b/|b. You can see the correct treatment in the fourth chord<br/>here. <a href="http://www.sagittal.org/exmp/index.htm">http://www.sagittal.org/exmp/index.htm</a></p><p>There is an additional error in the mixed notation of several Ab chords.
