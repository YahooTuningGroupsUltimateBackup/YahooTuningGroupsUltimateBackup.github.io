(Or is prime limit rather than<br/>odd limit the default)?&gt;&gt;</p><p>I seem to have been adhering to an idiosyncratic definition of odd-limit,<br/>which when I examined it in detail was not even internally consistent.  I<br/>should have stuck to prime limit.</p><p>&lt;&lt;What does LCM stand for?&gt;&gt;</p><p>Least Common Multiple.</p><p>Hi Margo,</p><p>&lt;&lt;<br/>Marion has raised the interesting issue of why Ancient Greek theorists<br/>were apparently not concerned with polyphony, and here I would like<br/>only to suggest that the use of the Pythagorean scale does not seem to<br/>me a persuasive explanation. From what I understand, for whatever<br/>reasons, the outlook at least of the Greek practice and theory for<br/>which we have evidence was essentially monophonic. Apparently neither<br/>the tuning of the Pythagoreans with its pure ratios of 6:8:9:12, nor<br/>that of Ptolemy with its intervals of 5:4 and 6:5, nor that of<br/>Aristoxenos with its equal semitones, happened to evolve in a musical<br/>milieu oriented toward polyphony.<br/>&gt;&gt;</p><p>I don&apos;t think the polyphony issue makes a lot of difference.  After all, if<br/>the consonance of tones that are not sounded together made no difference,<br/>then there would be no need of tuning or scales for monophonic music.  We all<br/>know that isn&apos;t true.  All of us have experienced people who can &quot;sing out of<br/>tune&quot; totally without accompaniment.  Apparently there is some sort of<br/>short-term memory for tone that allows us to &quot;compare&quot; recently sounded notes<br/>as if they were sounded simultaneously.</p><p>I think that this ability relates to speech, or even more fundamentally vocal<br/>signaling in birds and mammals.  If one signal has been identified, and<br/>another signal comes along whose pitch is related by small-whole-number<br/>ratios, then there is a higher probability that the new signal is not noise.</p><p>I find it constructive to try to listen to conversation as if it were music.<br/>There are definite musical patterns.  When a speaker is trying to interrupt<br/>another, he will often make an introductory sound, establishing his pitch<br/>reference, the famous &quot;uh&quot;, which may actually have a communications function<br/>other than annoying English teachers.  Is music a human attempt to create<br/>artificial speech?</p><p>What intervals did the Greeks use in their speech?  There is some chance that<br/>modern Greek uses the same tonality as such things vary slowly in language.</p><p>&lt;&lt;<br/>For example, as Marion has ingeniously asked, might performers<br/>realizing the ideal of a Pythagorean intonation on non-fixed-pitch<br/>instruments tend to shade an 81:64 toward a 19:15, or a 729:612 toward<br/>a 10:7?<br/>&gt;&gt;</p><p>Upon reflection, it has occurred to me that even if the 729:512 is being<br/>sounded with absolute accuracy, the listener is going to hear over 500<br/>repetitions of the 10:7 pattern while he is hearing one repetition of the<br/>729:512.  I believe the 10:7 pattern will pretty much swamp the longer<br/>729:512.</p><p>It is certainly your right to love Pythagorean tunings.  I have found them<br/>difficult to work because they are much more difficult to reproduce<br/>accurately with electronics.  Maybe I&apos;ll make an effort to understand them<br/>better one of these days.</p><p>Hi Paul,</p><p>&lt;&lt;<br/>You didn&apos;t, through no fault of your own. I haven&apos;t signed my messages, but<br/>my name<br/>is Paul Erlich.<br/>&gt;&gt;</p><p>Ah.  You&apos;ve been on this list a long time then, and we&apos;ve had other<br/>conversations before this.</p><p>&lt;&lt;<br/>Marion -- this discussion was about styles in which only 3-(odd) limit<br/>intervals<br/>were considered consonant. Of course, once 5-limit intervals were accepted as<br/>consonant, the tuning of the scales needed to be tweaked in order to increase<br/>the<br/>total number of consonant intervals. This led to developments such as<br/>schismatic<br/>tuning and meantone temperament, which you can read more about in Margo<br/>Schulter&apos;s<br/>paper (and I recommend you do!) But before that, only fifths and fourths were<br/>used<br/>as consonances in the music and other intervals were used as dissonances. To<br/>apply<br/>your criterion of maximizing the number of 5-limit consonant intervals would<br/>be a<br/>terrible anachronism if applied to Western music c. 900-1200.<br/>&gt;&gt;</p><p>That&apos;s your concept of what this discussion was about.  My view is that I<br/>made a remark about Pythagorean tunings in a post that was basically about<br/>something else, and some people took exception.  Not that I mind.  The whole<br/>discussion has been a good education for me, and thank you for taking the<br/>time to analyze what I am saying.</p><p>&lt;&lt;<br/>&gt; With a lattice approach you might, for example use the familiar:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; 6 9<br/>&gt; 5 8 15<br/>&gt; 4 6 16</p><p>What is that? It doen&apos;t remind me of any lattice approach I&apos;ve ever seen. A<br/>lattice is an infinite<br/>arrangement of points such that the configuration of every point relative to<br/>its neighbors is the same as<br/>that of any other point relative to the second point&apos;s neighbors.<br/>&gt;&gt;</p><p>In my original post, I said:</p><p>&lt;&lt;<br/>I have written a program that generates scales from aliquot parts.  It also<br/>does lattices  if my definition of lattices is the same as yours.  To find<br/>out, you can download the file from my web site at<br/><a href="http://members/aol.com/mckyyy">http://members/aol.com/mckyyy</a>.<br/>&gt;&gt;</p><p>I was in some doubt as to whether my concept of lattice was the same as that<br/>used on the list, and it now seems that doubt was justified.  In view of what<br/>I have learned since then, I am going to change my terminology and call  the<br/>system I was using chord multiplication.  In other words, I just multiply all<br/>those numbers together, 4*6*16, 4*6*15, 4*8*16, etc. and sort the products,<br/>eliminate duplications, and octave adjust the results, and I have a scale.</p><p>From my current understanding of &quot;lattice&quot; as used in the list, select a<br/>subset of points from an &quot;infinite&quot; lattice, and use a procedure much like<br/>the above to generate the scale?  I realize it&apos;s highly probable that my<br/>understanding of lattice is about to undergo some evolution.</p><p>Since I have been a professional programmer for so long, I tend to view these<br/>things in terms of combinations, sorting, searching, and so forth.  The idea<br/>of a graphical representation of these problems seems to be taking the long<br/>way around to me, so my interest in lattices has been minimal.</p><p>&lt;&lt;What does electronics have to do with it?&gt;&gt;</p><p>IMHO, electronics is the main reason we are here today talking about tuning.<br/>The invention of electronic frequency divider instruments that can reproduce<br/>tunings economically and with unprecedented levels of accuracy has<br/>fundamentally changed the art of music and renewed the debate about tuning<br/>standards that was &quot;settled&quot; by the near universal adoption of 12-et in the<br/>Western World.</p><p>A lot of it has to do with exact JI, which, as far as I can tell was invented<br/>in the 1930&apos;s by someone at the Wurlitzer Organ Co.  The Wurlitzer organ had<br/>&quot;tone wheels&quot; which were all connected mechanically to the same shaft, but<br/>with different numbers of holes in the wheels.  The ratio between the tones<br/>was mechanically fixed and could never vary.  Exact Just Intonation tuning.<br/>In the late 50&apos;s Freeman filed a patent on using a frequency divider network<br/>in exactly the same way.  In 1966, I did a patent search on the same idea,<br/>and it did not uncover Freeman&apos;s work because his patent hadn&apos;t issued yet, I<br/>think.  I negotiated with several musical instrument companies to promote the<br/>idea, and eventually found out about the Freeman/Wurlitzer work.  Wurlitzer<br/>successfully broke Freeman&apos;s patent on the grounds that it was obvious in the<br/>light of their prior art.  I had the opportunity to discuss this with the<br/>Wurlitzer people when I was trying to sell them some of my work on automatic<br/>harmony.   They referred to Freeman informally and indirectly as a &quot;parasitic<br/>inventor.&quot;  In my opinion, Freeman&apos;s work is both brilliant and<br/>unappreciated, not that I mean to slight the groundbreaking efforts of the<br/>Wurlitzer Organ Co.</p><p>Anyway, you can have exact JI using either tone wheels or frequency dividers,<br/>and since frequency dividers are a lot cheaper and more flexible, they<br/>commonly used in electronic musical instruments today.  The potential for<br/>exact JI is there, but the programming doesn&apos;t support it</p><p>&lt;&lt;<br/>&gt; Of course, these considerations only apply to exact JI.  If you allow<br/>&gt; approximation to come into the picture, then you are in a different<br/>universe,<br/>&gt; which in my opinion is not a JI universe but a tempered universe.</p><p>Approximations exist in JI as well. It is unavoidable that one will hear a<br/>very complex ratio as a simple<br/>one if it the former is very near to the latter, e.g., 30001:20001 will be<br/>heard as 3:2.<br/>&gt;&gt;</p><p>That is why I coined the term exact JI to differentiate it from ordinary JI.<br/>Actually, there is some error, even in frequency divider instruments, but it<br/>is usually measured in picoseconds.</p><p>The LCM of 3:2 is 6, which means you can produce the exact ratio with 3<br/>flip-flops and a master clock frequency which is only twice the lowest<br/>desired frequency.  The LCM of 30001:20001 is 600050001.  To generate this<br/>interval with a frequency divider would require about 30 flip-flops and a<br/>master clock 20001 times higher than the lowest frequency.  That&apos;s only a<br/>little over eight megacycles at 440HZ, so it could be done.</p><p>&lt;&lt;<br/>Do you mean that the fact that she made contributions to the list made you<br/>stop thinking her paper was<br/>authoritative?<br/>&gt;&gt;</p><p>No, I was convinced because she corroborated what you were saying, and she<br/>had hard numbers to back it up.  I try to look beyond credentials when I can.<br/> I try not to be prejudiced for or against the tuning list.</p><p>Thanks to all for your comments,</p><p>Marion</p></div><h3><a id=2436 href="#2436">ðŸ”—</a>alves@xxxxx.xx.xxx.xxxxxxxxxxxxxxx)</h3><span>4/20/1999 4:57:31 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>&gt;Marion has raised the interesting issue of why Ancient Greek theorists<br/>&gt;were apparently not concerned with polyphony, and here I would like<br/>&gt;only to suggest that the use of the Pythagorean scale does not seem to<br/>&gt;me a persuasive explanation.

He further speculates that the players<br/>pressed their fingers on certain strings, dampening them so that only<br/>certain pitches would sound, creating chords.</p><p>In fact, without dampening monophonically plucked strings, the decays would<br/>overlap, like a lot of celtic harp players I&apos;ve heard, also creating, as<br/>Dudley Duncan pointed out, harmonies. Further, there is evidence of drone<br/>pitches used in some contexts.</p><p>Clearly, the Greeks were not unaware of simultaneous sonorities, despite<br/>the monophonic basis of much of their music. Much of Chinese and Indian<br/>music is also &quot;monophonically based,&quot; and yet simultaneous sonorities have<br/>an influence on tuning there.</p><p>While many ancient writers in the Pythagorean tradition justify tunings<br/>through numerology/astrology, Ptolemy at least made reference to tunings<br/>used in practice as whole number ratios. Aristoxenus&apos; appeal to the<br/>musician&apos;s ear certainly suggests that, at least for some, tuning was more<br/>than a numerological exercise.</p><p>^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^<br/>^ Bill Alves                                      email: <a href="mailto:alves@hmc.edu">alves@hmc.edu</a> ^<br/>^ Harvey Mudd College                 URL: <a href="http://www2.hmc.edu/~alves/">http://www2.hmc.edu/~alves/</a> ^<br/>^ 301 E.
