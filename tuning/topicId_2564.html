I pick up<br/>most appropriate ones (would-be most pleasing<br/>to the ear). The criterion for this I use,<br/>doesn&apos;t lie, however, in my own evaluation<br/>by listening to the thus created sequence.<br/>Instead, I use various mathematical/physical/<br/>logical criteria. In doing this I raise and<br/>keep in mind philosophical questions, such as:</p><p>1) The total number of possible sequences is<br/>equal in my case to 17**13. Only some of them<br/>are nice. Which ones ? Is the judgement<br/>evolution-dependent ? Is the *beauty* changing<br/>in history ? Is any phisical principle behind<br/>it ?<br/>2) Is it possible to logicaly deduce what the<br/>brain would like/accept as nice ? Meaning, to<br/>deduce without using an experience and with<br/>absence of feedback from people ?<br/>3) Instead of listening to a sequence of notes,<br/>what if we try to generate an acoustic signal,<br/>the frequency of which varies in time according<br/>to a function y=func(freq,t). What is the course<br/>of the signal that again is nice to the ear ?<br/>4) What is the relation between that signal (y)<br/>and it&apos;s approximation/substitution by a<br/>sequence of notes ? Does the brain itself<br/>samples/approximates the signal so that it<br/>becomes a signal of a constant frequency in<br/>an interval ?</p><p>Thank you for your considerations.<br/>Petr Pospisil</p></div>
