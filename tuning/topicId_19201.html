If any of you can<br/>understand it, it would be really great to get some thoughts on where to<br/>build the roads from here.</p><p>&gt;How did you develop your ideas?<br/>&gt;What inspired your creative work into this area?<br/>&gt;Do you derive any influence from Indian music for this - perhaps from<br/>the use of the tanpura in this music?</p><p>ORIGINS/INSPIRATIONS/OVERVIEW:</p><p>LaMonte Young&apos;s work particularly with long held continuous pitches has<br/>always inspired me; the late John Whitney (Sr)&apos;s films and moreover his<br/>principle of<br/>&quot;differential dynamics&quot; led me to apply an extension of such techniques to<br/>timbrally-varying drones, (the tamboura also was certainly present as muse),<br/>although later its been applied to scores and midi. So initially it began<br/>life as a 128 harmonics&apos;-modulating drone/graphics audio-visual sequence<br/>where one sees the magical transforms one hears.</p><p>WHITNEY&apos;S DIFFERENTIAL DYNAMICS:</p><p>   (see Whitney&apos;s out of print book &apos;Digital Harmony&apos;  McGraw Hill  (1980?))<br/> A Hundred point &quot;radius&quot;:<br/>  Imagine 100 points (or more, or less) forming the radial line of an<br/>invisible circle. Imagine each point, prepared to set off on a circular<br/>motion at a distance from the circle&apos;s centre which is equal to its initial<br/>distance from it. If moving at the same angular velocity, the points would<br/>move in rotation like a stick connected to the circle centre. But- now start<br/>off again with each of the 100 points moving with an angular velocity<br/>proportional to an index number from 1 to 100 assigned to each point,<br/>numbered from one end to the other (it matters not from which end - each<br/>option has interesting and beautiful outcomes). This is best timed to last<br/>between 10 and 30 minutes (I feel). At first, a winding spiral dominates,<br/>but winds itself to &apos;break-up&apos; point at which stage crystallisations and<br/>dissolutions of order begin to occur.(These are really good).<br/>  At the end of the cycle, point 1 (&apos;speed 1 also) will have done one<br/>complete circle orbit, point 2 - 2 circles, point 3 - 3 circles etc. up to<br/>100 orbits for point 100. So the cycle at this point would begin again from<br/>a line identical to the position of the start. At the &apos;halfway&apos; stage, all<br/>the odd numbered points will have covered n/2 (n divided by 2) laps (where n<br/>is the point&apos;s index number), which will be &apos;an integer plus one half&apos;<br/>orbits, forming a line halfway around the circle from the start position.<br/>The even numbered index points will all be at their start position.<br/>  In fact, any fraction up to a denominator of about a fifth or a sixth of<br/>the number of points plotted will yield a figure like this halfway shape-<br/>but having a number of projecting radial arms equal to the fraction&apos;s<br/>denominator.<br/>  This results in a quite breathtaking display of simple forms emerging from<br/>and dissolving into the teeming of moving points.</p><p>  Another elementary way in which the principle can be demonstrated:<br/>  A line of points may be drawn along the leftmost (say), column of a<br/>screen.  256 points (say), are each assigned a row of of the screen to move<br/>along to the right .Upon reaching  the far end of the screen, the points may<br/>either reappear at the opposite edge to move again from the left, or , as an<br/>alternative system, each one could &apos;BOUNCE&apos; , i.e. travel backwards, and<br/>then eventually forwards again.<br/>  Making the points move at speeds proportional to their respective index<br/>number, as described earlier gives rise to comparable  effects to the circle<br/>system, only with vertical instead of radial alignments at the<br/>crystallization points.</p><p>  Maybe this is how an ant would perceive a 128-harmonic tone or a JI chord<br/>if it were a)<br/>musical and b) its time sense was slowed sufficiently??</p><p>&gt;What are some of the technical aspects of this work?</p><p>ORIGINAL EXPERIMENTS:<br/>Initially, the question arose- &quot;What happens if I apply Whitney&apos;s<br/>differential dynamics to the points in a wave table?&quot;<br/>Imagine a sine wave, composed (8 bits- this is 1983!) point 1 moves from its<br/>initial position, incredibly slowly, when it reaches the maximum value, its<br/>starts downwards again, and bounces back up again when reaching the lowest<br/>possible value. It completes a cycle in say 44 minutes. Point 2 completes 2<br/>cycles of movement, and arrives back at the start point in the same 44mins.<br/>Point 3 will do 3 cycles &amp;c &amp;c.........and point 256 will have completed 256<br/>cycles.<br/>  The sine waveform had index numbers assigned to each point (for speed<br/>assignments) from 0 (!) at the left (say) end, to 255 at the right, I found<br/>that a sonic journey (through 400,000 timbres) was produced, easily<br/>fascinating enough - even on one pitch, which journeyed through complex<br/>timbral &apos;states&apos; formed from many combinations and amplitudes, gradually<br/>changing, of 128 harmonics. An &apos;orchestral&apos;, 7-octave sheet of tone-anchored<br/>from one, low fundamental.<br/>I ran this timbre-itself-harmonically-transforming on a low B with the 2<br/>speakers fractionally detuned to create a mobile phase loop.<br/>Its like applying the laws of sound and harmonics of Helmhlotz&apos;s<br/>&quot;atmospheric ocean&quot; to the shape itself of the sound waves on that ocean.<br/>It quickly became known as &quot;the tone&quot;,and &quot;the UFO tone&quot;.</p><p>The sounds resulting are smoothly varying modulations of timbre that can be<br/>very satisfying or stimulating or both, to listen to. I prefer the changes<br/>on the slower side.</p><p>TIMBRAL ANALYSIS:<br/>A very thin ripple of amplitudes (1 or sometimes 2) harmonics wide runs<br/>slowly up and then down the harmonic axis (from 1 to 128 and then back the<br/>same way) forming a difference tone at the fundamental resulting from the<br/>ascending (ie n+1th) and descending (ie nth) harmonics.</p><p>BOUNCE MK 2 - MODIFIER SHAPES:<br/>  A modification of the assignment system of speeds to points was then<br/>developed. Rather than always having the linear array of points moving at<br/>speeds proportional to their &quot;index number&quot; , it became desirable to assign<br/>the speeds in different ways. Such as having the middle points in the<br/>sequence travelling fastest, and those at each end slowest. Or vice versa.<br/>This gave rise to the concept of a MODIFIER shape. In the elementary system<br/>described before, a graphical shape of position in sequence plotted against<br/>speed was a ramp form (either ascending or descending). If fastest (or<br/>slowest) speeds are assigned to the middle, this can be called a VEE<br/>(because of its shape) or TRIANGLE modifier.<br/>In another variant, fastest (or slowest) speeds are assigned to the 1/4 and<br/>3/4 positions along the sequence of movable points.<br/>  The most successful sound/visual combination (on the video/Sound mandala<br/>piece called<br/>&apos;Triangles&apos;) was a triangle wave starting point (this now referred to as the<br/>SEED form, with &apos;two triangles&apos; as a modifier. (Two &apos;mountains&apos; with maximum<br/>speed at 1/4 and 3/4 points. The two halves of the image were set to move in<br/>different directions at the start. Many interesting forms arise, which<br/>suggest Inca designs. The timbral and graphic sequences are each<br/>characteristic of a particular quality, right through the whole cycle.</p><p>TIMBRAL ANALYSIS:<br/>These sound sequences (or tones as they have been called) create on the<br/>palette of 128 (or more of course) harmonics constellations or virtual<br/>harmonics, gathering, scattering and reforming eg a ripple of amplitude<br/>running up and then down the axis of harmonic numbers.<br/>If I start with a sine wave and modify it with two humps (like the modulus<br/>of a sine wave- values without a minus sign), and starting by moving the<br/>left half up and the right down I get a strange bundle (looking at a dynamic<br/>FFT) of harmonics 4 or so harmonics wide, travelling up and down.</p><p>EDIT or PREDESIGN?:<br/>We (my then students Michael Tusch, James Larsson and other friends in the<br/>80s, and now Dave Snowdon in the 90s and 00s) decided we like/d to listen to<br/>an unedited algorithm, rather than edit fragments a la Shakespeare with<br/>portions, we have gone for designing the action into the spec. (in the<br/>envisioning of the characteristics and the ramifications) rather than<br/>cutting up bits. This I feel is an interesting paradigm approach for all<br/>kinds of computer-generated art. More organic? What do you think?<br/>John Whitney Sr had a bad reaction to this approach at first, but when I<br/>later met him, and discussed/elaborated it, he seemed much more open to what<br/>I had been doing.</p><p>FROM BOUNCE to SEQUENCE:<br/>DIFFERENTIAL DYNAMICS TO HARMONIC MATHEMATICS: We quickly generalised<br/>Whitney&apos;s principle to not only governing motion (controlled by a large 1D<br/>array of integers) but also the movement through a table of values (instead<br/>of just travelling at constant rate, points would sweep through eg a timbre<br/>wave table&apos;s values, each at a different integer rate).<br/>  I wanted then to make the motions do better than simply go up and down and<br/>back to where they started. I conceived of a sequence of values (i.e.<br/>positions) through which each point moves, but, again, at speeds related to<br/>assigned integer values, which are in turn in whole number ratio (and hence<br/>harmonic) to each other. Hitherto, each point moved up, bounced, moved down,<br/>bounced, and moved back to starting point.<br/>  A harmonically constructed complex timbre form, (eg a timbre with<br/>harmonics 1,2,3,4,6,12 with amplitudes gradually decreasing) is used instead<br/>to control the movement sequence of each point. This 6-harmonic timbre gives<br/>rise to a sequence of intricate, smooth bobbing motions, each point<br/>gradually rolling in and out of alignment with others.<br/>  The points&apos; motion in this more complex way I call SEQUENCE technique. The<br/>crystallization points are spectacular in different ways, the way in which<br/>they are approached are also, being not simply an &apos;overtaking&apos; process, but<br/>also having unrolling and twirling motions, implying a 3-dimensional<br/>interpretation. Also one gets &quot;magic carpet&quot; effects where layers of points<br/>waver and hover.<br/>  &apos;Helix&apos; uses a timbre, comprised of those harmonics 1,2,3,4,6 and12, as a<br/>sequence. The points start off as a horizontal line (silence), and each<br/>point moves through the sequence at a rate proportional to its distance from<br/>the left hand end. (i.e. a ramp modifier).<br/>  The timbral journey resulting consists of the 6 harmonics &quot;themselves<br/>going on a journey&quot; up and down the 7-octave spectrum of that synthesizer,<br/>at a speed proportional to the no. of the harmonic.(ie at speeds<br/>1,2,3,4,6,12). This I gleaned from FFTs I ran in the 80s.<br/>  Why these particular timbral/harmonic motions ? I don&apos;t know, and would<br/>like to know,<br/>so I can find interesting variant animations of these harmonics&apos; ripples.<br/>Doing an FFT is one thing, predicting how to get interesting results is<br/>another. Help!<br/>    The maths of how and why specific harmonic processes result from the<br/>seed and modifier shapes (in BOUNCE technique) and from the modifier and<br/>sequence tables (in SEQUENCE technique) still evades me.</p><p>SOFTWARE PACKAGES/2001:<br/>I currently am working to evolve this further using MAX/MSP on a Macintosh.<br/>Super Collider needs for someone to write ugens in order to do calculations<br/>on the fly in absolutely precise integers, which is not possible yet!<br/>CSound seems to me currently (on the mac anyhow) to not permit dynamic<br/>repeated cyclic update of in-use wave table entries- I couldn&apos;t see a way on<br/>a PC version.</p><p>Thanks if you got this far.</p><p>Let me know any feedback<br/>if anyone finds this useful or inspiring I&apos;d be glad to know about it.<br/>Yours mathematically, musically and spiritually<br/>Lawrence Ball</p><p>LAWRENCE BALL-<br/>composer<br/>math tutor<br/>director, Planet Tree Music Festival     <a href="http://www.planettree.org">http://www.planettree.org</a></p></div><h3>Kraig Grady &#x3C;kraiggrady@anaphoria.com&#x3E;</h3><span>2/21/2001 6:29:12 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Lawrence!<br/>    Have you done any experiments/realizations with speakers placed<br/>specific wave length apart.

Point 2<br/>completes 2<br/>&gt; cycles of movement, and arrives back at the start point in the same<br/>44mins.<br/>&gt; Point 3 will do 3 cycles &amp;c &amp;c.........and point 256 will have<br/>completed 256<br/>&gt; cycles.</p><p>Let me ask if the movements here are incremental, or is it a smooth<br/>slow glissandi between points? For instance, when you move from the<br/>fundamental to the second harmonic, it is a single step?</p><p>I&apos;m imagining that it would seem as a gliss at this slow of movement<br/>in the higher harmonics.</p><p>&gt;   The sine waveform had index numbers assigned to each point (for<br/>speed<br/>&gt; assignments) from 0 (!) at the left (say) end, to 255 at the right,<br/>I found<br/>&gt; that a sonic journey (through 400,000 timbres) was produced, easily<br/>&gt; fascinating enough - even on one pitch, which journeyed through<br/>complex<br/>&gt; timbral &apos;states&apos; formed from many combinations and amplitudes,<br/>gradually<br/>&gt; changing, of 128 harmonics.

Amazing!</p><p>&gt; I ran this timbre-itself-harmonically-transforming on a low B with<br/>the 2<br/>&gt; speakers fractionally detuned to create a mobile phase loop.<br/>&gt; Its like applying the laws of sound and harmonics of Helmhlotz&apos;s<br/>&gt; &quot;atmospheric ocean&quot; to the shape itself of the sound waves on that<br/>ocean.<br/>&gt; It quickly became known as &quot;the tone&quot;,and &quot;the UFO tone&quot;.</p><p>I&apos;m not sure if I understand this part about the fractionally detuned<br/>speakers. How did you do this? Couldn&apos;t you achieve this with<br/>software these days, by changing the phase relationships between the<br/>left and right channels?</p><p>What was the frequency of the &quot;B&quot; - the fundamental?</p><p>&gt;<br/>&gt; The sounds resulting are smoothly varying modulations of timbre<br/>that can be<br/>&gt; very satisfying or stimulating or both, to listen to.

So was the pitch of B was high enough to allow<br/>the perception of the difference tone below what would be the<br/>fundamental pitch?</p><p>What I like about this is how you have taken this phenomenon produced<br/>in the ear and have made it into a functional part of this work.
