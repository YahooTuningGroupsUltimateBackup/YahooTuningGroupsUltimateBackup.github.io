I know it&apos;s at least available for Windows; I have it at<br/>home. Also, CSound has a &quot;phase vocoder&quot; analysis option which can be used<br/>to feed into its phase vocoder synthesizer. CSound is available for<br/>Windows, Linux and Mac, but I don;t know about BeOS. The best way to get<br/>CSound is to buy &quot;The CSound Book&quot;, which includes a chapter of phase<br/>vocoder analysis.</p><p>--<br/><a href="mailto:znmeb@teleport.com">znmeb@teleport.com</a> (M.
