Werntz is<br/>thus serial. And the serialism proposed is thus more artificial than any JI<br/>scheme suggested, as it has no basis in any connection of tones at all.</p><p>Maneri&apos;s technique hovers about tones, giving them temporal emphasis - this<br/>is a &apos;tonal&apos; technique as it does not destroy the sense of tonal polarity.<br/>If I take tonality in too wide a sense for some, then obviously, they do not<br/>pay attention to a much wider scene of music in which diatonicism is the<br/>last thing to be associated with it, yet it is tonal.</p><p>&gt; What I really do in my paper is to advocate a few<br/>&gt; specific things, for example microtonal equal temperaments in general, an<br/>&gt; &quot;atonal&quot;<br/>&gt; approach (even though I dislike that word), and something I call, for fun,<br/>&gt; &quot;atwelvetonality&quot;</p><p>If that is not serialism, and the example 9 on page 195 of PNM is not a set,<br/>then I have been misled, by both Perle (with whom I have corresponded about<br/>tonality) and Schoenberg, and Rufer, and Babbitt, and a great many others.<br/>What else is an ordered sequence of pitches but a set? Music written using a<br/>set is serial, whether it contains 5 notes or fifty.</p><p>I find it both sad and unfortunate that the statements I make are &apos;absurd&apos;,<br/>when they are logically true. These are not opinions, but statements of<br/>fact.</p><p>&gt; In an ideal world this wouldn&apos;t be necessary, but since many of you,<br/>&gt; even those &quot;vocal&quot; ones with strong opinions on the topic, probably won&apos;t go<br/>&gt; and<br/>&gt; borrow a copy of PNM to read it for yourselves, I&apos;ll just try to clear up a<br/>&gt; few of the<br/>and<br/>&gt;who also has almost certainly<br/>&gt; never seen my music or Maneri&apos;s, except for some relatively tiny excerpts in<br/>&gt; the<br/>&gt; PNM article) could have gotten away with absurd statements</p><p>I have read both the Dissertation and the PNM article. Not extracts. Both.<br/>So please correct me if you think that I have not read them. an example of<br/>missing the point is in order:</p><p>after discussing works which combine different tuning systems, we get:</p><p>&gt;&apos;disobeying the laws of just intonation in order to create interesting<br/>&gt;dissonances&apos;</p><p>what laws? There aren&apos;t any, so far as I know. Either in combination or<br/>succession. And if there are no laws, then they cannot &apos;ignore and devalue<br/>the music of all great composers and improvisers&apos; and they cannot &apos;deny<br/>human complexity&apos;</p><p>and then afterwards we have:</p><p>&gt;&quot;One is compelled to wonder whay a composer could not just side-step the theory<br/>&gt;and access these new pitches more directly through some sort of system that<br/>&gt;provides, ready made,t he sixth tones, quarter tones, etc. that help make these<br/>&gt;pieces interesting - as microtonal equal temperaments do.&quot;</p><p>maybe they didn&apos;t want the pitches of the equal temperaments. and they may<br/>have to choose several tempered tones from several sets of divisions.  As I<br/>said, about using other tones from the harmonic series:</p><p>If we are to go about &apos;adding pitches&apos;, then surely, what better place to<br/>start, but with those sounds that are simplest in one sense, yet<br/>/unfamiliar/. These new sounds are &apos;interesting&apos;, without resorting to<br/>artificial divisions of the musical space that Werntz suggests.</p><p>12EDO is artifical, as is any other. Music written using such is not<br/>artificial, but its components tend toward an inner truth, whose realization<br/>at the hands of good performers will lead away from 12EDO.</p><p>Remember, 12EDO is not a system in itself, it is the outgrowth of a need to<br/>render different keys reasonably in tune. The same applies to 31 and 19 and<br/>other EDOs that contain the diatonic (western 7-note) scale.</p><p>I find it irritating to think that a composer would choose a set of<br/>divisions over a selection of tones whose derivation may be mathematical,<br/>but grows from the very nature of the tone. I am sorry, but I will not<br/>fetter the imagination merely to satisfy an arbitrary requirement.</p><p>&gt;Don&apos;t you all advocate what you do?</p><p>Certainly not!</p><p>I advocate the search for musical truth, not what I do as a composer. What I<br/>may write as a composer may be utterly wrong. This may happen when (and if)<br/>I get to 90. I don&apos;t care. What is more important is the search itself. And<br/>when I see someone who has become fixed only on one thing, an aesthetic, and<br/>thinks it is an eternal law. That is why I criticised the Werntz article,<br/>because it suggests that it is eternally right, when so obviously, by its<br/>very exclusivity of approach, it is wrong.</p><p>If one thing comes along that can prove to me systematically (I was trained<br/>as a scientist) that what I have done is wrong, then I will accept it. That<br/>is a challenge worth acceding to. But not one based on opinion.</p><p>Personally, I am neither in favour nor against JI, and the same goes for<br/>EDOs. What I am in favour of is music, not blind rules.</p><p>Do you have the courage not just to be challenged, but to be proved wrong?<br/>and the courage to accept it?</p><p>A quote to finish, p 170 in Werntz &apos;Adding Pitches&apos;, PNM v 39 / 2:</p><p>&quot;Certainly the need to engage in the intensely negative act of denouncing is<br/>a dubious foundation for a new music&quot;</p><p>Need I say more...</p></div><h3><a id=37219 href="#37219">ðŸ”—</a>genewardsmith &#x3C;genewardsmith@juno.com&#x3E;</h3><span>6/4/2002 2:12:05 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In tuning@y..., Mark Gould &lt;mark.gould@a...&gt; wrote:</p><p>&gt; What else is an ordered sequence of pitches but a set?</p><p>Mathematicians would not call that a set.</p></div><h3><a id=37224 href="#37224">ðŸ”—</a>emotionaljourney22 &#x3C;paul@stretch-music.com&#x3E;</h3><span>6/4/2002 2:56:03 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In tuning@y..., &quot;genewardsmith&quot; &lt;genewardsmith@j...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt; --- In tuning@y..., Mark Gould &lt;mark.gould@a...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; What else is an ordered sequence of pitches but a set?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Mathematicians would not call that a set.</p><p>oh well, what musicians call &apos;set theory&apos; is completely different<br/>that what mathematicians call &apos;set theory&apos;.</p><p>and mathematicians use a different set of conventions for what theta<br/>and phi mean in polar coordinates, or the orientation of the x, y,<br/>and z axes, or something, than do physicists. and engineers call the<br/>square root of -1 &quot;j&quot;. they simply respect one another&apos;s conventions<br/>and get on with it.</p><p>i think where they differ, we need to use *musicians&apos;* terminology on<br/>this list, since this is classified as a *music* list. on the tuning-<br/>math list, which falls under *mathematics*, we can use the *math*<br/>conventions . . . how&apos;s that?</p></div><h3><a id=37226 href="#37226">ðŸ”—</a>emotionaljourney22 &#x3C;paul@stretch-music.com&#x3E;</h3><span>6/4/2002 2:50:25 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In tuning@y..., Mark Gould &lt;mark.gould@a...&gt; wrote:</p><p>&gt; Remember, 12EDO is not a system in itself, it is the outgrowth of a<br/>need to<br/>&gt; render different keys reasonably in tune.
