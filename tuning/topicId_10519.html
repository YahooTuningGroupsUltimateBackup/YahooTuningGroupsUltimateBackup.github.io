Basic concepts and notations<br/>-------------------------------</p><p>Any multi-voice sonority may be described either as a set of tones or<br/>as a set of vertical intervals. For example, let us consider the<br/>sonority</p><p>   | D4<br/>   |    5<br/>m7 | G3<br/>   |    m3<br/>   | E3</p><p>with C4 indicating middle C, and higher notes showing higher octaves.<br/>As the diagram shows, we have three notes (E3, G3, D4) and three<br/>intervals: a minor seventh, minor third, and fifth (m7, m3, 5).</p><p>To show the ordering of these intervals, we may use the notation<br/>(m7|m3 + 5), which might be read, &quot;an outer minor seventh divided by<br/>the middle voice into a lower minor third and upper fifth.&quot;</p><p>If we build another sonority with the same interval set (m7, m3, 5) in<br/>a different arrangement, a conversity results. Let us build such a<br/>conversity while retaining E3-D4 as the outer minor seventh:</p><p>   | D4               | D4<br/>   |    5             |    m3<br/>m7 | G3            m7 | B3<br/>   |    m3            |    5<br/>   | E3               | E3</p><p>(m7|m3 + 5)        (m7|5 + m3)</p><p>Our second sonority E3-B3-D4 has the same set of intervals -- but with<br/>the fifth now placed below and the minor third above.</p><p>From a perspective of tuning theory, an interesting feature of<br/>three-voice conversities is that the frequency-ratio of a sonority<br/>will be equal to the string-ratio of its conversity, and vice versa.<br/>Thus for our (m7|m3 + 5) and (m7|5 + m3) forms as tuned in 3-limit,<br/>5-limit, and 7-limit ratios:</p><p>Limit           Ratios for (m7|m3 + 5)      Ratios for (m7|5 + m3)<br/>-----           ----------------------      ----------------------<br/> 3              frequency: 27:32:48         string:    48:32:27<br/>                string:    32:27:18         frequency: 18:27:32</p><p> 5              frequency:   5:6:9          string:      9:6:5<br/>                string:    18:15:10         frequency: 10:15:18</p><p> 7              frequency: 12:14:21         string:    21:14:12<br/>                string:      4:6:7          string:      7:6:4</p><p>While conversities share the same set of intervals in different<br/>arrangements, inversions share the same set of pitch classes. Thus our<br/>E3-G3-D4 sonority has the pitch class set (E, G, D), and we may, for<br/>example, transpose the lowest note up an octave to form an inversion<br/>of this sonority:</p><p>   | D4               | E4<br/>   |    5             |    M2<br/>m7 | G3            M6 | D4<br/>   |    m3            |    5<br/>   | E3               | G3</p><p>(m7|m3 + 5)        (M6|5 + M2)<br/>(E, G, D)          (E, G, D)</p><p>Note that while E3-G3-D4 and G3-D4-E4 share the common set of pitch<br/>classes (E, G, D), and thus are inversions, they do not share the same<br/>set of intervals -- (m7, m3, 5) and (M6, 5, M2) respectively -- and<br/>therefore are not conversities.</p><p>------------------------------------------<br/>2. When is a conversity also an inversion?<br/>------------------------------------------</p><p>Some stable and mildly unstable 3-limit sonorities of 13th-14th<br/>century Gothic polyphony in Western Europe have the interesting<br/>characteristic of being analyzable as either conversities or<br/>inversions.</p><p>Thus most obvious example might the complete stable trine, with an<br/>outer octave, lower fifth, and upper fourth (e.g. D3-A3-D4) -- or with<br/>the fourth conversely placed below and the fifth above:</p><p>   | D4               | D4<br/>   |    4             |    5<br/> 8 | A3             8 | G3<br/>   |    5             |    4<br/>   | D3               | D3</p><p>(8|5 + 4)          (8|4 + 5)</p><p>In determining whether (8|5 + 4) and (8|4 + 5) might be inversions as<br/>well as conversities, the test is whether we can build one form from<br/>the other using the same set of pitch classes.</p><p>Starting from the (8|5 + 4) form, D3-A3-D4, for example, we can do<br/>this by taking the upper fourth A3-D4 of this sonority, making this<br/>the lower interval of our new sonority, and adding the upper fifth<br/>D4-A4:</p><p>   | D4               | A4<br/>   |    4             |    5<br/> 8 | A3             8 | D4<br/>   |    5             |    4<br/>   | D3               | A3</p><p>(8|5 + 4)          (8|4 + 5)<br/>(D, A)             (D, A)</p><p>Both sonorities share not only the same interval set (8, 5, 4) but<br/>the same pitch class set (D, A) -- so that they are inversions as well<br/>as conversities.</p><p>This example illustrates an important point about pitch class sets in<br/>general and 3-limit trines in particular. At least for me, the<br/>sonorities D3-A3-D4 and A3-D4-A4 intuitively have different pitch<br/>contents: &quot;two D&apos;s an octave apart plus a single A&quot; in contrast to<br/>&quot;two A&apos;s an octave apart plus a single D.&quot;</p><p>From the viewpoint of inversional affinity, however, both D3 and D4 in<br/>the first sonority represent the same pitch class D; and likewise A3<br/>and A4 in the second sonority the same pitch class A. With pitch class<br/>sets, following mathematical set theory, the ordering of elements is<br/>irrelevant and repeated elements are notated only once. Thus the<br/>trines D3-A3-D4 and A3-D4-A4 share the pitch class set (D, A), and are<br/>inversions as well as conversities.</p><p>Three-limit trines have three notes (e.g. D3-A3-D4 or A3-D4-A4) and<br/>intervals (8, 5, 4), but only two pitch-classes (e.g. D, A). This last<br/>property distinguishes them from 5-limit triads, which similarly have<br/>three notes (e.g. D3-F#3-A3 or D3-F3-A3) and intervals (5, M3, m3),<br/>but also three pitch-classes (e.g. D, F#, A).</p><p>In addition to the stable trines, two relatively concordant but<br/>unstable Gothic sonorities mentioned by Jacobus likewise are at once<br/>conversities and inversions. These sonorities consist of an outer<br/>fifth plus a middle voice dividing this fifth into a fourth below and<br/>a major second above, or the converse:</p><p>   | D4               | D4<br/>   |    M2            |    4<br/> 5 | C4             8 | A4<br/>   |    4             |    M2<br/>   | G3               | G3</p><p>(5|4 + M2)          (5|M2 + 4)</p><p>Here the fifth and fourth provide euphonious concord, while the<br/>relatively tense major second (9:8) adds color and excitement. The<br/>mirror symmetry of the two arrangements is reflected in the symmetry<br/>of their string-ratios and frequency-ratios:</p><p>        Ratios of (5|4 + M2)       Ratios of (5|M2 + 4)<br/>        --------------------       --------------------<br/>         Frequency:  6:8:9          String:     9:8:6<br/>         String:    12:9:8          Frequency:  8:9:12</p><p>Are these conversities sharing the interval set (5, 4, M2) also<br/>inversions? We can demonstrate that they are by starting with our<br/>first arrangement G3-C4-D4 (5|4 + M2), and transposing the lowest note<br/>up an octave to arrive at C4-D4-G4 (5|M2 + 4):</p><p>   | D4               | G4<br/>   |    M2            |    4<br/> 5 | C4             8 | D4<br/>   |    4             |    M2<br/>   | G3               | C4</p><p>(5|4 + M2)          (5|M2 + 4)<br/>(C, D, G)           (C, D, G)</p><p>Since both sonorities share the same pitch class set (C, D, G), they<br/>are inversions.</p><p>-----------------------------------------<br/>3. When is a conversity not an inversion?<br/>-----------------------------------------</p><p>In Western European composition, the most familiar example of a<br/>conversity which is not also an inversion may be the two flavors of a<br/>sonority described by Jacobus in a Gothic context as a _quinta fissa_<br/>or &quot;split fifth&quot; divided by a middle voice into two thirds, by Zarlino<br/>in a 16th-century setting as _harmonia perfetta_, and by Johannes<br/>Lippius (1612) as the _trias harmonica_ or harmonic triad.</p><p>Whether it is used as a mildly unstable 3-limit sonority, as in the<br/>13th and 14th centuries, or a fully concordant 5-limit one, as in the<br/>Renaissance and later eras, this three-note sonority has the interval<br/>set (5, M3, m3), with the major third placed below and the minor<br/>above, or the converse:</p><p>   | A3                 | A3<br/>   |     m3             |    M3<br/> 5 | F#3              5 | F3<br/>   |     M3             |    m3<br/>   | D3                 | D3</p><p>(5|M3 + m3)          (5|m3 + M3)</p><p>Both the 3-limit and 5-limit versions of this combination, and also<br/>the 7-limit versions familiar in some 20th-century music, have the<br/>symmetrical ratios characteristic of three-voice conversities:</p><p>Limit           Ratios for (5|M3 + m3)      Ratios for (5|m3 + M3)<br/>-----           ----------------------      ----------------------<br/> 3              frequency: 64:81:96         string:    96:81:64<br/>                string:    81:64:54         frequency: 54:64:81</p><p> 5              frequency:   4:5:6          string:      6:5:4<br/>                string:    15:12:10         frequency: 10:12:15</p><p> 7              frequency: 14:18:21         string:    21:18:14<br/>                string:      9:7:6          frequency:   6:7:9</p><p>While the term &quot;triad&quot; is sometimes used to describe any three-voice<br/>sonority, application of this term to the medieval _quinta fissa_<br/>combination may unfortunately suggest to many people the idea of the<br/>later stable 5-limit _harmonia perfetta_ or triad. Using the term<br/>_quinta fissa_ or &quot;split fifth&quot; in a 3-limit Gothic setting avoids<br/>such an implication.</p><p>Whatever the stylistic context and tuning limit, we find that the two<br/>arrangements (5|M3 + m3) and (5|m3 + M3) are conversities but not<br/>inversions. In other words, there is no way of rearranging the pitch<br/>classes forming one arrangement so as to derive a sonority with the<br/>same pitch class set but the converse arrangement.</p><p>If we start with D3-F#3-A3, for example, which has the major third<br/>below and minor third above (5|M3 + m3), there is no way we can<br/>rearrange the pitch class set (D, F#, A) so as to produce the converse<br/>flavor with minor third below and major third above (5|m3 + M3):</p><p>   | A3                | D4               | F#4<br/>   |     m3            |     4            |     M3<br/> 5 | F#3            m6 | A3            M6 | D4<br/>   |     M3            |     m3           |     4<br/>   | D3                | F#3              | A3</p><p>(5|M3 + m3)         (m6|m3 + 4)        (M6|4 + M3)<br/>(D, F#, A)          (D, F#, A)         (D, F#, A)</p><p>All these arrangements share the identical pitch class set (D, F#, A),<br/>and are therefore inversions; but they have different interval sets,<br/>and thus are not also conversities. We shall shortly return to this<br/>example (Section 4), but the immediate point is that we cannot derive<br/>the two converse flavors of a medieval _quinta fissa_ combination or<br/>later 5-limit triad by a process of inversion.</p><p>-----------------------------------------<br/>4. When is an inversion not a conversity?<br/>-----------------------------------------</p><p>Just as some conversities are not also inversions, so some inversions<br/>are not also conversities.</p><p>In the 3-limit world of Gothic music, two mildly unstable sonorities<br/>mentioned by Jacobus share the property of being identical to their<br/>own conversities, but of having a variety of nonidentical inversions.<br/>These sonorities have a middle voice splitting an outer major ninth<br/>into pure fifths, or an outer minor seventh into two pure fourths:</p><p>    | G4               | F4<br/>    |    5             |    4<br/> M9 | C4            m7 | C4<br/>    |    5             |    4<br/>    | F3               | G3</p><p>(M9|5 + 5)          (m7|4 + 4)</p><p>Since the lower and upper fifths of (M9|5 + 5), or the lower and upper<br/>fourths of (m7|4 + 4), are identical, &quot;flipping&quot; the order of these<br/>intervals results in an identical arrangement. Thus either sonority is<br/>its own conversity.</p><p>From a mathematical viewpoint, sonorities of this type represent what<br/>is termed a geometric division of the outer interval into two &quot;twin&quot;<br/>intervals with identical ratios -- more informally, we might speak of<br/>a &quot;mean-ratio division.&quot; Thus (M9|5 + 5) divides the outer major ninth<br/>at 9:4 into two 3:2 fifths, with a frequency-ratio of 4:6:9 and an<br/>identically proportioned string-ratio of 9:6:4; (m7|4 + 4) divides the<br/>outer minor seventh in two 4:3 fourths, with a frequency-ratio of<br/>9:12:16 and a string-ratio of 16:12:9.</p><p>While either of these sonorities has no nonidentical conversities, as<br/>it happens these two sonorities share a relationship of inversional<br/>affinity along with two others we have already met (Section 2) which<br/>are also mutual conversities:</p><p>    | G4               | F4               | G4               | C4<br/>    |    5             |    4             |    M2            |    4<br/> M9 | C4            m7 | C4             5 | F4             5 | G3<br/>    |    5             |    4             |    4             |    M2<br/>    | F3               | G3               | C4               | F3</p><p>(M9|5 + 5)          (m7|4 + 4)         (5|4 + M2)         (5|M2 + 4)<br/>(F, C, G)           (F, C, G)          (F, C, G)          (F, C, G)</p><p>All four sonorities share the same pitch class set (F, C, G), and thus<br/>partake of a &quot;family resemblance&quot; of inversional affinity; the last<br/>two sonorities additionally share the interval set (5, 4, M2), and so<br/>are also conversities as discussed in Section 2.</p><p>Of interest in a 13th-century context as mildly unstable 3-limit<br/>sonorities, these four related combinations are also of great interest<br/>in a 20th-century context, where they are often known as &quot;fourth<br/>chords&quot; or &quot;fifth chords,&quot; and may be treated as stable concords. They<br/>occur in various world musics with leanings toward vertical fifths and<br/>fourths; for example, the form with a major ninth and two fifths has<br/>been noted in Japanese koto music.</p><p>A curious case where two sonorities are conversities but not<br/>inversions, and yet may appear to be &quot;near-conversities,&quot; occurs if we<br/>compare the two inversions of a 5-limit triad briefly introduced in<br/>Section 3:</p><p>   | A3                | D4               | F#4<br/>   |    m3             |     4            |     M3<br/> 5 | F#3            m6 | A3            M6 | D4<br/>   |    M3             |     m3           |     4<br/>   | D3                | F#3              | A3</p><p>(5|M3 + m3)         (m6|m3 + 4)        (M6|4 + M3)<br/>(D, F#, A)          (D, F#, A)         (D, F#, A)</p><p>Strictly speaking, these two inversions are not conversities, because<br/>they contain different interval sets: (m6, m3, 4) and (M6, M3, 4).<br/>However, if we regard interval categories such as thirds and sixths in<br/>a generic way (treating either M3 or m3 as a generic &quot;third,&quot; etc.),<br/>then these sonorities do seem to have an affinity somewhat akin to<br/>conversity, since they share the same generic interval set (6, 3, 4)<br/>in converse arrangements:</p><p>   | D4                | F#4<br/>   |     4             |     3<br/> 6 | A3              6 | D4<br/>   |     3             |     4<br/>   | F#3               | A3</p><p>(6|3 + 4)            (6|4 + 3)<br/>(D, F#, A)           (D, F#, A)</p><p>Thus while two saturated 5-odd-limit sonorities which are conversities<br/>cannot also be inversions, and vice versa, they may sometimes be at<br/>once true inversions and &quot;near-conversities.&quot;</p><p>Most respectfully,</p><p>Margo Schulter<br/><a href="mailto:mschulter@value.net">mschulter@value.net</a></p></div>
