Follow<br/>it with a volume pedal.  You could use a bow, Jimmy Page style.  Or make a<br/>magnetic feedback system on your guitar...</p><p><a href="http://www.fernandesguitars.com/Misc/Index/index_Sus.html">http://www.fernandesguitars.com/Misc/Index/index_Sus.html</a></p><p>As I understand it, you use an extra pickup, a small amplifier, and an<br/>electromagnet (could be a pickup with the magnets removed, or a coil from a<br/>speaker, etc).  The pickup captures the tone of the strings, then you<br/>amplify it, but instead of sending to a speaker, send it to an electromagnet<br/>underneath the strings thereby exciting the string with more of the original<br/>vibration and sustaining it.  If you add volume and tone pots to the system,<br/>you can control how much feedback there is (volume), and the ratio of<br/>fundamental to overtone in the feedback(tone).  The pickup that goes to your<br/>guitar amp can be totally separate from this system.  In the Fernandes<br/>system, I think they use the same pickup.</p><p>I bet this would give you the exact effect you are looking for, without<br/>compromising tone, volume, dynamic range, or responsiveness of the<br/>instrument.</p><p>I just tried it using the tiny coil of a cheap old car stereo speaker.  It<br/>sort of worked for the bass string when I cranked the amp up, but just when<br/>the effect started getting noticeable, the coil started smoking.  :-(  Also,<br/>it was very easy to get piercing feedback magnetically through the pickups -<br/>keep the coil away from the pickup!  I probably need some sort of pole piece<br/>inside the coil to focus the magnetic field.  I tried using a hex nut that<br/>fit in there, but it didn&apos;t make much difference.  The steel in the nut did<br/>not seem very magnetic, maybe part aluminum.  Also hex nuts are torroidal,<br/>probably the only shape that wouldn&apos;t work for this application.  Any<br/>suggestions would be welcome.  I think I have the right idea, but am<br/>grasping at straws for the implementation.  Maybe a pickup with the magnet<br/>removed?  Don&apos;t feel like smoking any pickups today.  I&apos;ll wait for<br/>suggestions.</p><p>So for the time being, buy a Fernandes.</p><p>You will still need to use your volume knob, or a volume pedal to get the<br/>&quot;coming out of nothing&quot; effect.</p><p>---<br/>Glen Peterson<br/>Peterson Stringed Instruments<br/>30 Elm Street North Andover, MA 01845<br/>(978) 975-1527<br/><a href="http://www.organicdesign.org/peterson">http://www.organicdesign.org/peterson</a></p></div><h3><a id=5843 href="#5843">ðŸ”—</a>patrick pagano &#x3C;ppagano@xxxxxxxxx.xxxx&#x3E;</h3><span>10/31/1999 9:11:21 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>if you are talking guitar type stuff i say Ebows on three or four guitars</p></div><h3><a id=5849 href="#5849">ðŸ”—</a>Clark &#x3C;caccola@xxxxxxxx.xxxx&#x3E;</h3><span>10/31/1999 8:36:51 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>A few years ago, Fernandes made a cute , vaguely elephant-shaped guitar with a<br/>speaker built-in under the strings.

Finally, for his particular<br/>piece the E-bow turned out to be the best solution. So only single notes<br/>will be sustained, the chordal sustain will be sacrified and the<br/>clean sound will be priviliged. The problem in itself is interesting though<br/>and I hope one day I can really work it out.<br/>Patrick, would you join my E-bow guitar orchestra? :) In fact, why not?</p><p>Wim Hoogewerf</p></div>
