If I am to understand this correctly, it<br/> means that pitches would have to be constantly &quot;retuned&quot; in order to affect<br/> a legitimate JI interpretation of Schubert in 5-limit.  This retuning would<br/> have to be virtually instantaneous, something perhaps a synthesizer and<br/> sequencer could do... or on the other hand, non-tempered instruments which,<br/> I believe is what Daniel Wolf was getting at.  If I understand his posts,<br/> they seem to be suggesting that Schubert is sometimes ALREADY played in<br/> 5-limit JI by non-tempered instruments...  So, although Schubert is a<br/> &quot;closed 12-tone system,&quot; perhaps other things are going on in live<br/> performance. &gt;&gt;</p><p>I don&apos;t think you&apos;ve quite got it right.  Let&apos;s take a hypothetical example,<br/>where a theme modulates through a series of keys by thirds, eventually<br/>returning to the original key. In JI, this would actually miss the octave by<br/>some interval, but in a temperament this interval has be spread out through<br/>the entire progression.  In returning to the original key, a temperament<br/>makes a homophone pun between the origin and key that would have been reached<br/>in JI.  Had the progression been realized in JI, the destination key could<br/>potentially represent a _heterophone_ pun on the original key.  Ironically,<br/>perhaps, the success of this pun may depend on the listeners&apos; conditioned<br/>expectations from temperament.</p><p>The more common type of punning is found in pivot chord modulation, where a<br/>given pitch or chord has one identity going in and a second going out.<br/>(Wilson&apos;s CPSs are full of wild JI puns of this sort).  In addition, there<br/>are ambiguous sonorities where multiple senses of a pun may be simultaneously<br/>heard. In these case, JI tends to disambiguate puns, perhaps not usefully so.</p><p>A &quot;pun&quot; is a rhetorical trope which may be also be ironic but not<br/>necessarily; irony is a separate trope.  I find harmonic punnning to be a<br/>central element of common practice musical rhetoric.  Some puns are<br/>homophone, some heterophone, others portmanteau constructions.  In _Finnegans<br/>Wake_, for example, Joyce prefered the latter; Duchamp was a largely<br/>homophone punster, perhaps, as David Antin suggested, an inheritance from the<br/>futurist movement (a pun being a pendulum oscillating between meanings).</p><p>With regard to Schubert, I did not make any claim that his chamber music for<br/>strings was or could be played in JI, but rather that a form of adaptive<br/>tuning may be at work.  In that is the case, where local instances of JI are<br/>embedded in a tempered global harmonic structure, it would be very<br/>interesting to explore how that global structure was constructed, to hear if<br/>Schubert used different strategies in his music for instruments with flexible<br/>pitch to those in his keyboard music.</p></div>
