Since the 1950s Stockhausen has<br/>become infamous spouting pseudo-scientific mystical<br/>gibberish apparently intended to create an aura of<br/> scientism and/or profundity  around his music.<br/> Alas, Stockhausen only succeeded in making<br/>himself look ridiculous.<br/>   Stockhausen&apos;s bizarre  comments about the World<br/>Trade Center tragedy as &quot;art&quot; seem par for the course,<br/>part and parcel of the entire modernist project of<br/>trying to degrade and dehumanize all art and music<br/>and literature by removing all vestiges of human<br/>emotion and human response. Of course Karlheinz and<br/>his ilk do not consider themselves to be engaged in<br/>a process of self-degradation, just as the fanatics<br/>who steered those 757s into the world trade probably<br/>did not believe that they were degrading themselves.<br/>Nonetheless, the bottom line in both cases (modernist<br/>post WW-II music, Islamic suicide bombers) boils down<br/>to nothing more nor less than abject self-debasement.<br/>   Stockhausen&apos;s contemptible efforts to wriggle out<br/>of what he said, aided and abetted by the odious<br/>webmaster James Stonebraker who calls for the reporter who<br/>documented Stockhausen&apos;s comments to be &quot;fired&quot;<br/>and censored, are likewise par for the course.<br/>    The entire project of modernism in music and<br/>art can be summarized as a Stalnist purge of all human<br/>elements from music and art. As with Soviet Stalinism,<br/>musical modernism requires plenty of heavy-handed censorship<br/>and threats and intimidation and rewriting of history<br/>to accomplish this subhuman goal.<br/>   It&apos;s all standard stuff. Look at the history of<br/>modernist music from the late 1940s right up through<br/>the present time, and you will find an uninterrupted<br/>trail of censorship and intimidation, purges and<br/>threats, dissenters silenced and written out of history,<br/>ideological deviants turned into unpersons and<br/>character-assassinated into oblivion:</p><p>   &quot;Just as Marxist-Leninist thought led to forms of<br/>government meant to remedy the excesses supposedly caused<br/>by the exhaustion of capitalism, so Schoenbergian-Boulezian<br/>practice was touted as the alternative to a purportedly<br/>exhausted system called &grave;tonality.&apos; These attempts to<br/>revolutionize, respectively, our economic and musical<br/>worlds had several other things in common besides their<br/>Germanic origin. The application or enactment of both<br/>ideologies required that their alternatives--and those<br/>who would support them--be publicly denounced and<br/>discredited, and a form of double-speak was employed<br/>in support of these &grave;revolutionary&apos; ideas. The apologists<br/>writing in Pravda held sway in support of a failing system<br/>in the same way that Herbert Eimert, Milton Babbitt, and<br/>Charles Wuorinen dominated the pages of Die Reihe and<br/>Perspectives Of New Music for many years. What is so<br/>interesting is the suddenness with which these application<br/>of science--some have said pseudo-science--to economics and<br/>music have been rejected and are now seen as merely...<br/>experiments that failed because they denied basic human<br/>realities: economic and cultural diversity in the<br/>political realm and the necessity for perceptual forms<br/>of organization and the power of intuitive<br/>processes in the world of music.&quot; [Appleton, Jon,<br/>&quot;Machine Songs III: Music in the Service of Science--<br/>Science in the Service of Music,&quot; Computer Music<br/>Journal, Vol. 16, No. 3, 1992, pp. 18-19]</p><p>   The webmaster James Stonebraker screams for someone to silence<br/>and censor and &quot;fire&quot; the reporter who inappropriately<br/>documented Karlheinz Stockhausen&apos;s remarks,  just as<br/>Pierre Boulez screamed during the 1950s &quot;Any composer<br/>who does not realize the absolute necessity of the<br/>twelve-tone method is USELESS!&quot;<br/>   All standard stuff. Part and parcel of the same overall<br/>plan.  Drain the human elements from music and crush anyone<br/>who tries to resist, censor anyone who dares to speak out<br/>against the ongoing ideological purges.<br/>   It&apos;s all typical, usual, standard, and quotidian. Absolutely<br/>standard stuff for modernist music (or modernist art, or<br/>modernist literary theory).<br/>   Why are you surprised by any of this, Joseph Pehrson?<br/>   _Of course_ Karlheinz Stockhausen spewed a bunch of<br/>high-falutin&apos; eerie-theory gibberish in which he<br/>inappropriately attempted  to equate a living horror<br/>involving the screaming deaths of 7,000 people with<br/>some artsy-fartsy pie-in-the-sky fancy-ass aesthetic<br/>&quot;theory.&quot;  Naturally.  Obviously.  That&apos;s the entire<br/>post-WW II modernist project--take vivid human realities<br/>and turn &apos;em into cold dead subhuman theoretical<br/>constructs devoid of human meaning.<br/>   Whether this is accomplished in modernist music by using<br/>serial atonal rows to so scramble pitch and rhythm and<br/>harmony that the resultant music has no discernible melody<br/>and no perceptible rhythm and no functional harmony, or<br/>whether this is accomplished in modernist art by sawing<br/>a pig in half and submerging it in a vat of formaldehyde<br/>and calling it &quot;art,&quot; or by plunging a crucifix into a<br/>plexiglas jar brim-full of rancid urine and calling it &quot;art,&quot;<br/>or by severing a cow&apos;s head and sticking it inside a glass<br/>enclosure full of maggots and calling it &quot;art&quot;... C&apos;mon.<br/>We all saw pictures of those sterile boring &quot;art&quot; exhibits<br/>at the Brooklyn Museum of Art, Joseph. We all know *that*<br/>story. All part of the same modernist project. You should<br/> have recognized, Joe Pehrson, that the  overall intent<br/>is the same in each case.<br/>    Namely, subject the audience to such grotesque sensory<br/>assualts that they become desensitized and lose all vestiges<br/>of humane emotional response. In this manner, the audience<br/>becomes a collection of obedient little automatons responding<br/>merely to sensory stimuli -- thus, when the Brooklyn Metropolitan<br/>Museum gets pervaded by the overwhelming stink of rotting flesh<br/>from the severed cow&apos;s head with maggots crawling on it, this<br/>merely provides a novel sensory stimulus to the modernist art<br/>connoiseur.  Any art patron who fails to thrill to such a novel<br/>sensory stimulus needs (obviously) to be exposed to more sensory<br/>assault, the better to insure complete emotional numbing.<br/>Likewise, when the concert hall thunders with screeching<br/>grinding dissonances and spasmodic splatters of incoherent<br/>musical notes interspered by bizarre noises and unpredictable<br/>periods of interminable silence, this also provides merely<br/>another novel sensory stimulus to the erstwhile modernist<br/>musical connoisseur.  Any Lincoln Center patron who refuses<br/>to thrill (for $500 per seat) to such incoherent grinding<br/>dissonances and random spasms of herky-jerky pitches must,<br/>of course, be subjected to a lot more acoustic assault, the<br/>better  to insure full emotional lobotomy.<br/>   This has been the modernist musical project for 55 years:<br/>subject the audience to Schoenbergian acoustic torment after<br/>Bouelzian musical brutalization after Babbit-ian rhythmic<br/>boredom after Cage-ian sonic bludgeoning until the audience<br/>becomes numbed and gives up their annoying &quot;obsolete&quot; &quot;decadent&quot;<br/>&quot;outmoded&quot; &quot;antique&quot; emotional responses, and merely smiles<br/>happily as the piano burns or the violinst hacksaws the<br/>violin strings, producing yet another wonderfully novel &quot;modern&quot;<br/>acoustic stimulus.<br/>    Stalin&apos;s Soviet state employed exactly the same kind of<br/>conditioning in creating the &quot;new Soviet man.&quot;  Torture the<br/>child&apos;s mother in front of him, shoot the child&apos;s father in<br/>front of him, beat the child&apos;s friends with bludgeons for<br/>&quot;anti-Soviet ideological deviance,&quot; and eventually the child<br/>becomes the New Soviet Man, ready and willing and eager to<br/>turn in his wife to the NKVD and help them rape her on<br/>command.<br/>    It&apos;s an old, old story.  All totalitarian systems use<br/>such methods to desensitize and robotize their citizens.<br/>Naturally the totalitarian ideology of musical modernism<br/>employs the same sadistic methods in order to obtain the<br/>same dehumanized reponse -- just as the Al-Qaeda terrorists<br/>no doubt do in their desert training camps, just as the<br/>Palestian terrorists do in their training camps, just as the<br/>S.S. Einsatzgruppen did to prepare their commandos for the<br/>the extermination programs against Jews in WW II, just as<br/>today&apos;s Chinese &quot;thought reform schools&quot; do nowadays.<br/>Totalitarian systems of thought all employ the same methods<br/>and aim at the same results, and music modernism is no exception.<br/>    So why should we find ourselves surprised by Karlheinz<br/>Stockhausen&apos;s subhuman response to an usnpeakable human<br/>tragedy? To Karlheinz, as a good little modernist ideologue,<br/>human emotions have long been banished from music -- and<br/>so Karlheinz sits happily in front of his TV set and watches<br/>screaming people fall from the twin towers of the World Trade<br/>Center with their skin burning off, and to Karlheinz&apos;s<br/>modernist ideology this is just another novel sensory<br/>stimulus.  And when howling women blubber and wail and collapse<br/>in agony with blood spurting from their mouths and noses<br/>as Trade Center Tower #2 subsides in a vast explosion of<br/>rubble and dust behind them, to Karlheinz the modernist this<br/>likely proves just another interesting sensory stimulus.  Karlheinz,<br/>like his modernist buddies Pierre Boulez and Milton Babbitt<br/>and Alan Forte and Robert Morris, no doubt listened to the<br/>shrieks and wails of the victims of the Sept. 11 tragedy<br/>with keen interest as prime examples of unusual acoustic<br/>stimuli.  Like a vivisectionist who slices a dog open<br/>without using anesthesia and remarks to his assistant as<br/>the dog yowls and flails with ever-more frantic shrieks<br/>and moans, &quot;Fascinating activity in the organism&apos;s<br/>vocal chords. Are we getting a recording of this?&quot;<br/>   To the modernists, human emotion is anathema. Accordingly,<br/>all becomes art -- in Walter Benjamin&apos;s memorably subhuman<br/>words, &quot;In modern art, everything can become everything else.&quot;<br/>Thus, small children howling as Josef Mengele skins them alive<br/>becomes potential art. A crucifix submerged in urine?  Potential<br/>art.  Twin 757s plowing into the world trade center towers?<br/>Potential art.<br/>   Why not?<br/>   After all, once human response has been banished, anything<br/>becomes possible.<br/>   Once human emotion and human response has been purged<br/>from modern music by the Stalinist-style censorship tactics<br/>of modern university music departments, it&apos;s no surprise that<br/>the so-called &quot;modern&quot;  composers who emerge from this subhuman<br/>environment exhibit all the human qualities of the Nazi medical<br/>experimenters at Dachau.   Ergo Stockhausen&apos;s remarkably<br/>bizarre comments -- and of course the webmaster [    ]&apos;s<br/>typically Stalinist reponse (&quot;the reporter should be fired,&quot;)<br/>exactly like Stalin&apos;s reponse to the Soviet Census Bureau<br/>that reported the USSR&apos;s population had plummeted as a<br/>result of Stalin&apos;s disastrously miscoonceived agricultural<br/>bugles: &quot;Kill the members of the Census Bureau,&quot; Stalin ordered.<br/>And of course it was done. The next Soviet Census Bureau did<br/>not make the mistake of correctly reporting that the USSR&apos;s<br/>population had dropped as a result of Lysenko&apos;s agricultural<br/>malfeasances and incompetences. Instead, just like New York<br/>modernist music critics, the Soviet Censur Bureau learned to<br/>give the correct response to the new stimuli, and<br/>they reported that the USSR&apos;s population was growing by leaps<br/>and bounds in the 1930s even while 30 million kulaks starved<br/>to death. (See Robert Conquest&apos;s &quot;Harvest of Sorrow&quot; for<br/>details.)<br/>   It&apos;s all standard stuff, the typical totalitarian reponse<br/>to inconvenient facts and inappropriate truths.<br/>   This is of course part and parcel of the entire project<br/>behind post-WW II modernism.  According to post-WW II musical<br/>modernist ideology, only novelty matters, and so any acoustic<br/>activitiy which produces novel acoustic stimuli is welcomed<br/>in the concert hall.  Thus we witness musical atrocities such<br/>as John Cage&apos;s &quot;concert&quot; consisting of Cage placing a microphone<br/>to his gullet while he swigs carrot juice, or acoustic<br/>monstrosities such as Schoenberg&apos;s &quot;Erwartung,&quot; which offers<br/>us the musical equivalent of the medical experiments at Dachau,<br/>or subhuman musical depravities such as Milton Babbitt&apos;s<br/>String Quartet Number 4:</p><p>   &quot;Perhaps the most interesting thing about Milton Babbitt&apos;s<br/>music is how totally uninteresting it can be. That seemed<br/>particularly true of Babbitt&apos;s String Quartet No. 4 (1970),<br/>which the Composers Quartet performed...presented by the<br/>Performers&apos; Committee at Columbia University. In the 15<br/>minutes or so that the piece lasted, I didn&apos;t hear any<br/>mood shifts or tempo changes, and never became caught<br/>in any coloristic moments. I didn&apos;t notice any particular<br/>intervallic or thematic relationships between the lines<br/>in the various instruments. For that matter, I didn&apos;t<br/>notice any patterns that seemed consistent enough to<br/>be considered thematic at all. I didn&apos;t detect any<br/>patterns in the way the music shifted between bowed<br/>notes and plucked notes.. (..)<br/>   &quot;One can find plenty of uninteresting music, but Babbitt<br/>is one of the only composers whose work can ever seem<br/>totally uninteresting, because he is one of the few<br/>composers who ever achieved such a degree of abstraction.<br/>A piece like this string quartet...isn&apos;t concerned at<br/>all with dramatic, or emotional elements, as far as<br/>I can tell, and it manipulates formal elements in<br/>so many erudite ways and on so many levels that one<br/>cannot follow the structural logic either. The extreme,<br/>arid abstraction that results may not be very valuable<br/>in any humanistic terms, but it is a rather remarkable<br/>achievement just the same.&quot; [Johnson, Tom. &quot;Milton Babbitt:<br/>Uninteresting Can Be Interesting,&quot; The Village VOICE, 12<br/>April, 1976]</p><p>    The key here is of course Tom Johnson&apos;s remark that<br/>&quot;the extreme, arid abstraction that results may not be<br/>valuable in any hunmanistic terms...&quot;  To Karlheinz<br/>Stockhausen and his fellow modernist musiKKKal fanatics<br/>Milton Babbitt and Pierre Boulez and John Cage, &quot;extreme<br/>arid abstraction&quot; is the entire goal, the alpha and omega,<br/>the be-all and end-all.  To Karlheinz and his buddies,<br/>as to the rabid fanatics who steered those 757s into<br/>the world trade center towers, the Ultimate Goal is all<br/>that counts. The Grand Plan is all, human response<br/>mean nothing.  Emotion is contemptible, human life is<br/>trivial. Only the Supreme Goal is worthy of discussion,<br/>only the Grand Plan deserves their attention.<br/>   Such responses typify the decadence and depravity of<br/>so-called &quot;modernist&quot; artists and musicians and literary<br/>figures, specifically those artists and musicians and<br/>literary figures who called themselves &quot;modern&quot; after<br/>WW II. I say &quot;so-called modernist&quot; because the genuine<br/>modernists created interesting and vivid modern art and<br/>modern music and modern literature and poetry from<br/>the 1890s to the 1930s. Then, around the time of the<br/>rise of fascism and Soviet Communism, modernism in the<br/>arts and in music and in literature/poetry got hijacked<br/>and perverted, degraded into a subhuman cult of torment<br/>and gibberish.<br/>    In exactly the same way that the noble and admirable<br/>religion of Islam was hijacked on 11 Setpember by a clique<br/>of ignorant and vicious fanatics and perverted into a<br/>subhuman cult of death and suffering, modernism in art and<br/>music and literature got hijacked in the late 1940s by a<br/>group of ignorant and vicious musical fanatics.  These<br/>ignorant fanatics, whose Hall of Shame includes Arnold<br/>Schoenberg and Pierre Boulez and Milton Babbitt, spoke<br/>with delight about destroying all previous modes of art<br/>and music and literature.  Boulez in particular seems to<br/>enjoy talking about destruction: in an interview in<br/>Contemporary Music Review, Boulez speaks with the utmost<br/>contempt of musicians and audiences who want to conserve<br/>the music of the past, and Boulez urges audiences and<br/>so-called &quot;modern&quot; musicians alike &quot;not to be afraid to<br/>destroy the past.&quot;<br/>    Yes indeedy, all good ole Pierre needs is a turban and a<br/>box cutter, and he&apos;d be right at home in the cockpit of those<br/>doomed 757s.<br/>   Like crazed madmen steering 757s into the twin towers<br/>of the World Trade Center while screaming &quot;Death to the<br/>Great Satan! Long ling the jihad!!!&quot; Schoenberg and<br/>Boulez and Babbitt and their ignorant vicious ilk steered<br/>the giant 757 of modern music into a flaming collision with the<br/>musical public.  In the process, the ignorant fanatics<br/>who hijacked modern music destroyed the audience for<br/>serious modern music, and made a laughingstock of themselves<br/>and their so-called &quot;music.&quot;<br/>   As for Stockhausen, he qualifies as one of the least<br/>poisonous but certainly one of the most deluded of that<br/>addplepa crew of musical modernists from the 1950s -- a<br/>crew whose depraved musiKKKal ideology still holds sway,<br/>by the way, over American and European university music<br/>depratments.<br/>   For an evaluation of Karlheinz Stockhausen&apos;s so-called<br/>&quot;contribution&quot; to modern music, let&apos;s hear from Leonard<br/>B. Meyer:</p><p>   &quot;The theory of music has always sought support and warrant<br/>from other disciplines--notably, mathematics and physics.<br/>Music theorists have assumed that musical structures and<br/>processes are similar to those of some model<br/>discipline--favored because of the elegance of its theory,<br/>the cultural acceptability of its doctrine...or some<br/>combination of these. Today&apos;s theorists are no exception.<br/>Indeed, the crisis in style has produced an almost<br/>frantic search for plausible models for music and music<br/>theory.<br/>   &quot;(..) Such &grave;borrowing,&apos; however, may lead to unfortunate<br/>consequences when the model, taken to be the &grave;main event,&apos;<br/>begins to influence and mold the actual practice of music.<br/>   &quot;The fallacies involved in the attempt to rationalize<br/>the procedures of total serialism by an appeal to the unity<br/>of the acoustic materials of music have already been<br/>considered; and the dubious logic of subjecting pitch and<br/>time to a single set of quasi-mathematical operations has<br/>been discussed. Now I want to deal, first, with the use<br/>of terms and concepts drawn from contemporary physics--<br/>usually quantum theory--which imply that there are real<br/>relationships between this science and music; and, second,<br/>with the use of statistical concepts, more particularly<br/>the mathematical theory of information, to explain and<br/>justify the procedures of experimental music.<br/>   &quot;The writing of the composer-theorists of the avant-garde<br/>--particularly the European branch--is replete with terms<br/>like space-time field relations, phase, quanta, statistics,<br/>and Heisenberg&apos;s uncertainty principle which are appropriated<br/>from contemporary physical theory and mathematics. Here are<br/>two brief examples:</p><p>    &grave;Here the passage of time can be determined only statistically<br/>--time as the effect of juxtaposed quanta... Thus the vital thing<br/>is that real time is produced by the shooting together of the<br/>effect of quanta, their density, their direction and the speed<br/>that becomes evident in them... But in addition one will apply<br/>the theory of relativity.<br/>    &grave;Such field-sizes are now the &grave;elements&apos; and composition<br/>thus include the statistical character of mass-structure among<br/>the elements. A &grave;pointillistic&apos; time-structure can now be<br/>presented, vice-versa, as a special case of mass-structure--<br/>the case when field-size equals zero, and each time-process is<br/>fixed in the time-continuum by a point instead of by a field.&apos;<br/>[Karlheinz Stockhausen: &quot;How Time Passes&quot;]</p><p>    &quot;The meaninglessness of such vacuous fustian has been discussed by John Backus and the fallacy of inappropriate quantification has been pointed out by Mel Powell. The number of technical or theoretical terms and concepts borrowed from quantum mechanics, relativity theory, and acoustics--but left undefined in the writings of the European  serialists--is so vast that it would be futile to try to discuss  them all.&quot; [Meyer, Leonard B. Music, the Arts and Ideas. The  University of Chicago Press: Chicago, 1967, pg. 254]</p><p>   We also get an window onto Karlheinz Stockhausen&apos;s<br/>&quot;contribution&quot; to modern music from the acoustician John<br/>Backus:</p><p>   &quot;The baffling technical language we encounter contains<br/>a  considerable amount of what appears to be scientific<br/>terminology--definitions, acoustical and physical terms,<br/>etc. (..) We may therefore examine Die Reihe with a critical<br/>eye...  We wish to see if the scientific terminology is<br/>properly used, to see if  the charts, graphs and tables<br/>have any real significance,  and to determine the technical<br/>competence of the  material from the scientific standpoint. (..)<br/>   &quot;Karlheinz Stockhausen contributes a article  of forbiddingly<br/>technical appearance.  (..) What he means by &grave;statistic&apos;<br/>variation is not known;  his later discussion of the term (I, 48)<br/>only  confuses matters further.<br/>   &quot;His subsequent discussion becomes more and more  inspired;<br/>mention is made of &grave;harmonic, sub-harmonic, and chromatic ptich-<br/>scales,&apos; &grave;spectral composition,&apos; &grave;line- and band-spectra,&apos; and so<br/>forth.  The climax is  reached in a paragraph which must be<br/>quoted in full to be appreciated (I, 47):<br/>  &grave;Differentiation of the intended permutation of timbres is<br/>obtained from the complexity resulting from the  simultaneous<br/>combination of the six formant regions within one sound process,<br/>from the varying of the elements or groups of elements, in all<br/>their components, according to the series and of coordinating a<br/>special intervallic scale of partials or of medium frequency<br/>width ratios in each formant octave.&apos; - Stockhausen</p><p>  &quot;This is formidable language.  What are the six  formant<br/>regions?  What is an intervallic scale of partials?  Or a medium<br/>frequency width ratio?  What is a formant octave?  None of these<br/>phrases has  been used or defined previously.  The individual<br/>words have perfectly well-defined scientific meanings, but are<br/>combined in ways that make no sense as acoustical language. The<br/>paragraph quoted is an excellent example of technical jargon<br/>without technical meaning. (..)<br/>  &quot;We conclude that Stockhausen&apos;s technical language is his own<br/>invention, using terms stolen from acoustics but without their<br/>proper acoustical meanings, and that the technical jargon he has<br/>developed is designed mostly to impress the reader and to hide<br/>the fact that he has only the most meager knowledge of<br/>acoustics.&quot;  [Backus, John, &quot;Die Reihe--A Scientific Evaluation,&quot;<br/>Perspectives of New Music, Vol. 1, No. 1, 1962, pp. 160-171]<br/>   There is a term which describes the use of &grave;technical<br/>jargon...designed mostly to impress the reader and hide the fact<br/>that [the user] has only the most meager knowledge of acoustics.&apos;<br/>    The term is &quot;scam.&quot;<br/>    Such pseudo-scientific scams were used to sell snake oil in<br/>the 1890s, Florida swamp-land in the 1920s, perpetual motion<br/>machines in the 1950s, junk bonds in the 1980s, and derivative<br/>stock options in the 1990s.  The use of technical-sounding<br/>gibberish to baffle and nonplus the unwary dupe is a staple of<br/>astrologers, spiritualists, fortune-tellers, ufologists,<br/>perpetual motion machinists, orgone therapists, bogus swamis,<br/>crystal-power healers, psychic surgeons, aura readers, and<br/>dowsers from time immemorial.</p><p>   &quot;In fact, the articles in Die Reihe conform to all the best<br/>traditions of pseudo-scientific writing in their disregard of<br/>accepted  meanings of scientific terms, their unintelligibility,<br/>and their complete lack of any reference to the results  of other<br/>workers as support for their statements.&quot; [Backus, J., &quot;Die Reihe<br/>- A Scientific Evaluation,&quot; Perspectives of New Music, Vol. 1,<br/>No. 2, 1962, pg. 171]</p><p>    In actual fact, what is misnamed musical modernism today is<br/>in reality a primitive superstition--a throwback to such crude<br/>mystery cults as the cult of Baal, or the belief system astrology<br/>or gematria. Worshippers of Baal hurled their children into the<br/>white-hot arms of a dead bronze idol becuase they had been deluded<br/>by ahandful of power-hungry high priests into believing that Baal<br/>was an all-powerful force of history...whereas, in reality, Baal<br/>was  merely a dead empty shell propped up by a foolish belief system<br/>which had no contact with reality.<br/>   In the same manner, parents today hurl their children into the<br/>white-hot arms of a dead idol called Musical Modernism, paying<br/>hundreds of thousands of dollars for wasted college tuitions<br/>because they have been deluded by a handful of power-hungry<br/>academic musical high priests into believing that Musical<br/>Modernism is an all-powerful force of history... Whereas, in<br/>reality, Musical Modernism is merely a dead husk surrounded by a<br/>foolish musical belief system which has no contact with reality.<br/>   Because it resolutely avoids the test of reality, musical<br/>modernism is mere numerological mysticism -- alebit using more<br/>elaborate mathematics than were used during the Middle Ages, but<br/>with the same results. Namely, a vast mass of incoherent and<br/>turgidly cabalistic nonsense:</p><p>   &quot;...After assiduously studying Babbitt&apos;s essay &grave;Twelve-tone<br/>invariants...&apos; Musical Quarterly, XLVI (April, 1960), 246-59, I<br/>have covered several sheets of music paper with experiments,<br/>exercises, and examples trying to penetrate the meaning of his<br/>discourse, and finally approached my learned friend by letter for<br/>more information.  It was of no avail, and I gave up in<br/>frustration since I did not wish to encroach further on his time.<br/>I am afraid that the use of this language in Perspectives has<br/>reached a point of diminishing returns: the possible increment of<br/>scholarly prestige (not to speak of snob appeal) is compensated<br/>by loss of communicability.&quot; [Krenek, Ernst, &quot;Some Current<br/>Terms,&quot; Perspectives of New Music, Vol. 5, No. 4, 1966, pg. 84]</p><p>   &quot;Such a resultant rhythm has just as little to do with<br/>ordering the sets as the previous example, and nothing to do with<br/>their contours.

But the supposition is not true.<br/>   &quot;I see no way for the ear to distinguish those attacks which<br/>define durations for Po and those which define durations for RI2.<br/>Thus, I see no way for the ear to perceive either order or<br/>content.&quot; [Westergaard, Peter, &quot;Some Problems Raised by the<br/>Rhythmic Procedures in Milton Babbitt&apos;s Composition for Twelve<br/>Instruments,&quot; Perspectives of New Music, Vol. 4, No. 2, 1965]</p><p>  &quot;We are reminded of Oswald Spengler&apos;s prediction forty years<br/>ago that the true representative of our age will be the engineer<br/>and that the artist will become obsolete.

In time it demonstrated how the<br/>lives of artworks (whose dependence on the auspices of higher<br/>education had in times past been negligible) could be sustained<br/>by artificial means beyond normal expentency, regardless of their<br/>direct aesthetic vibrancy.<br/>   &quot;The era&apos;s post-Viennese energy induced a remarkable<br/>production of analytical dissections and speculative tracts--more<br/>those than public performances of music. The torrent of words and<br/>numbers and fomulae unleashed about Schoenberg&apos;s methods, about<br/>their more thorough exploitation by Webern, and then about<br/>subsequent extensions (like those of Boulez and Babbitt) to other<br/>musical dimensions, produced one of the most bountiful crops of<br/>verbiage ever harvested in the cause of art.<br/>    &quot;The movement also habored a hidden cul de sac for the<br/>unwary.  Its participants produced a fair amount of theoretical<br/>&apos;how to...&apos;  composers&apos; shoptalk, which tended to be preoccupied<br/>with manipulations of notes as permutable collections, rather<br/>than with interpretive descriptions of phenomenal things. So the<br/>unassailable as permutable collections, rather than with<br/>interpretive descriptions of phenomenal things. So the<br/>unassailable and unchanging concern of musicians for the art&apos;s<br/>aural ontology became secondary to the orderings of serialized<br/>particles.  Permutations, reciprocal relativities,<br/>combinatoriality, segmentation, source sets, derived sets,<br/>intersections, adjacencies, partitions, germ cells, aggregates,<br/>pitch qualia, hexachords, mathematical models, complementation<br/>modulus-12, pitch (or note) cells, and the like dominated the<br/>literature of Serialism. (..)<br/>  &quot;Words  have special powers: _permutation_ had an inimitable ring of profundity, and _modulus-12_ was sheer magic.  Both seemed to<br/>guarantee conceptual precision and mathematical certainty; both<br/>hinted at the flinty &grave;rigor&apos; of the hard sciences. Such<br/>terminology prompted a comforting fantasy in the 1960s and 1970s;<br/>it allowed us metaphorically to put on laboratory smocks and<br/>pretend to be &grave;genuine scientists,&apos; the Einsteins of harmony.&quot;<br/>[Thompson, William, Schoenberg&apos;s Error, 1991, pg. 184]</p><p>-------------<br/>part 2 in next post<br/>--------------<br/>--mclaren</p></div>
