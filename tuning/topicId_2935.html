Eclectic, exciting and always entertaining<br/>&gt; performers with a deep sense of commitment to the music they play,<br/>&gt; Kronos&apos; musical legacy may be, in the words of The New York Daily<br/>&gt; News, &quot;...not how they play, but what.&quot;  This time they&apos;re outdoing<br/>&gt; themselves with an exceptional  program:<br/>&gt; &#x9;<br/>&gt; HARRY PARTCH (arr. Ben Johnston):  U.S. Highball:  A Musical Account<br/>&gt; of Slim&apos;s Transcontinental Hobo Trip - with special guest David<br/>&gt; Barron, vocal<br/>&gt; Steve Reich:  Triple Quartet - World Premiere!<br/>&gt; Igor Stravinsky (arr. John Geist):  The Rite of Spring - with special<br/>&gt; guest Margaret Kampmeier, piano<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &#x9;The Reich piece contrasts two taped quartets with Kronos&apos; live<br/>&gt; playing. This is a rare DC opportunity to witness a world premiere by<br/>&gt; a composer of Reich&apos;s stature.  The other must-see work is John<br/>&gt; Geist&apos;s arrangement of  Rite of Spring.  Word from San Francisco and<br/>&gt; New York is that the piece, not to mention seeing Kronos accompanied<br/>&gt; by piano, is absolutely incredible. If you haven&apos;t heard Partch&apos;s<br/>&gt; work, take heed: his compositions capitalize upon Kronos&apos; willingness<br/>&gt; to risk their rare virtuosity in a musical &quot;I dare you to play this&quot;<br/>&gt; fashion.<br/>&gt; &#x9;<br/>&gt; &#x9;Call our ticket office and tell them you are a member of  the<br/>&gt; tuning onelist and you&apos;ll get your Kronos tickets half price!<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &#x9;Our number at WPAS is 202-833-9800.
