That&apos;s Barlow&apos;s Indigenstibility Function!</p><p>I&apos;m glad you said that, because I&apos;ve heard of it but didn&apos;t know what it<br/>was.  I was actually playing with this in July, when I was in Berkeley.  I<br/>gave up when the only workable version I could find returned, after an<br/>ungainly computation, odd-limit!</p><p>Does anybody know if this is the same as the &quot;Barlow&apos;s harmonicity&quot; stuff<br/>that Scala returns?  Or what the &quot;Wilson harmonic complexity&quot; is?</p><p>&gt;Maybe even determined the factors by experiment?</p><p>While I personally find...</p><p>3=openess<br/>5=sweetness<br/>7=florescent lightingness</p><p>...and 15/8 to sound remarkably like its prime factorization would suggest,<br/>I doubt there&apos;s really anything going on here, at least that an experiment<br/>could turn up.  If there was, I think you&apos;d find the primes above 3<br/>weighted out of the formula.</p><p>I also hear 9 as a type of 3ness, and in ratios with a 5 or 7 in one half<br/>and a 9 in the other, I find the character dominated by the prime number.<br/>But there&apos;s just not enough primes and odds in the low numbers to test<br/>this.  The next odd number above 9 is 15, which is already too high to give<br/>these effects (i.e. 15/11 and 15/13 will approximate other lower-numbered<br/>ratios at least well-enough to mask any 15-ness).</p><p>C.</p></div><h3>manuel.op.de.coul@xxx.xx</h3><span>3/5/1999 5:22:52 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>&gt; Does anybody know if this is the same as the &quot;Barlow&apos;s harmonicity&quot; stuff<br/>&gt; that Scala returns?

I refer to Daniel&apos;s post for the explanation.<br/>The prime weights implied by the Indigestibility function can be changed<br/>to your own liking (SET HARMCONST). Together with SET WEIGHTING it can be<br/>used in the rational approximation of intervals.</p><p>Manuel Op de Coul    <a href="mailto:coul@ezh.nl">coul@ezh.nl</a></p></div><h3>Paul H.
