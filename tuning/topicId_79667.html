This is a very flexible system in which the<br/>feedback coming from reinforcement of the usefullness of a given<br/>percept dramatically affects how much brain power is devoted to<br/>working out and separating the details of any particular type of<br/>perception.</p><p>The logarithms are a part of the structure of the physical sound<br/>waves, but since human hearing is in a fairly narrow range, and<br/>relevant information which is reinforced culturally and<br/>experientially is probably in certain even narrower frequency bands,<br/>you can probably expect a distorted perceptual curve without any 1:1<br/>correspondences at all. Even if at some level of the perceptual chain<br/>there were 1:1 correspondence &quot;arrays&quot;, the reinforced perceptions<br/>would have much larger &quot;processing arrays&quot; devoted to them, resulting<br/>in a distorted map farther up the chain.</p></div><h3><a id=79703 href="#79703">ðŸ”—</a>Jack &#x3C;gvr.jack@...&#x3E;</h3><span>12/30/2008 7:44:04 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;traktus5&quot; &lt;kj4321@...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt; What if the receptors on the basilar membrane were not laid out<br/>&gt; logarithmcally, and there was, instead, a 1:1 relationship between<br/>the<br/>&gt; stimulus (tone-producing vibration) and the sensation (&quot;pitch&quot;).

I think they&apos;re just<br/>something neat that humans have figured out over years and years of<br/>toying around with stuff. The phantom fundamental that appears when an<br/>interval or chord is played has something to do with a particular<br/>psychoacoustic phenomenon, but playing a chord with the notes picked<br/>so that an overtone on top will ring out I think is just something<br/>that sounds neat that people have been playing with for years and<br/>managed to make artistic sense out of. In that way there might be a<br/>&quot;third&quot; neat thing to do with harmony that nobody&apos;s even thought of<br/>yet - a good candidate might be perhaps the recent experiments with<br/>metastable intervals, in which there is no easily perceptible common<br/>overtone nor a viable virtual fundamental.</p><p>-Mike</p><p>On Tue, Dec 30, 2008 at 8:58 PM, traktus5 &lt;kj4321@...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt; hi Kent (and others)... great quotes and info on this topic.<br/>&gt; hmmm...pattern recognition....that&apos;s why I&quot;ve always suspected that<br/>&gt; harmonic dualism is correct with regard to the tonal power of the<br/>&gt; minor triad, even though it supposedly isn&apos;t explained by the<br/>&gt; harmonic series...that, since the harmonic series is processed at<br/>&gt; a &apos;high level&apos; as a pattern, that &apos;flipping it around&apos; (inverted<br/>&gt; series) is a &apos;piece of cake&apos;..if you know what I mean!

Why do we perceive only one pitch when we listen to a musical<br/>&gt;&gt; tone made up of many harmonics? Why do we perceive this pitch even<br/>&gt;&gt; when the fundamental frequency is absent? Why do we resolve pitch<br/>&gt; so<br/>&gt;&gt; well, despite the relatively broad mechanical resonance regions on<br/>&gt;&gt; the basilar membrane? Concerning the first two questions,<br/>&gt;&gt; psychoacoustical and neurophysiological experiments show that for<br/>&gt;&gt; pitch identification, in addition to the position of the resonance<br/>&gt;&gt; region the brain may also use information on the temporal shape of<br/>&gt;&gt; the acoustical vibration pattern. For low frequencies this<br/>&gt;&gt; information is encoded in the form of the time-sequence of<br/>&gt; electrical<br/>&gt;&gt; nerve pulses--a sort of &quot;neural Morse code&quot;. This result may<br/>&gt; explain<br/>&gt;&gt; why when hearing a musical tone we perceive a single pitch--that of<br/>&gt;&gt; the first harmonic or fundamental--even if this frequency is<br/>&gt;&gt; physically absent in the stimulus. This part of the course can be<br/>&gt;&gt; illustrated with several psychoacoustical demonstrations using<br/>&gt;&gt; &quot;laboratory&quot; equipment such as a reasonably sized pipe organ!<br/>&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt; Concerning the third question above, it was not until 15 years ago<br/>&gt;&gt; that in vivo measurements revealed the astounding fact that some of<br/>&gt;&gt; the acoustical detector cells on the basilar membrane have<br/>&gt; motility.<br/>&gt;&gt; They vibrate &quot;on their own power&quot; at acoustical frequencies and act<br/>&gt;&gt; as feedback-controlled &quot;electromechanical&quot; amplifiers of the<br/>&gt; external<br/>&gt;&gt; stimulus, thus greatly sharpening the resonance regions! At times<br/>&gt;&gt; these cells vibrate on their own without any external input--our<br/>&gt; ears<br/>&gt;&gt; are not only acoustical receptors, but can also be acoustical<br/>&gt;&gt; emitters!<br/>&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt; Today, even the basic operation of pitch perception is viewed as a<br/>&gt;&gt; pattern recognition process by the brain, in analogy to the more<br/>&gt;&gt; familiar pattern recognition processes in the visual system. Our<br/>&gt;&gt; brain carries (or builds through experience) &quot;templates&quot; against<br/>&gt;&gt; which the signals of incoming sounds are compared--if there is a<br/>&gt;&gt; match with the template that corresponds to a harmonic tone, a<br/>&gt;&gt; musical tone sensation with definite pitch is evoked. This is not<br/>&gt;&gt; unlike the graphic symbol A evoking in your brain a single<br/>&gt; cognitive<br/>&gt;&gt; signal &quot;it&apos;s an A&quot; (and not &quot;it&apos;s two inclined lines forming a<br/>&gt; vertex<br/>&gt;&gt; with a horizontal bar across&quot;). And just as happens with the<br/>&gt; optical<br/>&gt;&gt; system, if part of the acoustical stimulus is missing, or if the<br/>&gt;&gt; stimulus is somewhat distorted, our brain is still capable of<br/>&gt;&gt; providing the correct sensation! Today, we even speak<br/>&gt; of &quot;acoustical<br/>&gt;&gt; illusions&quot; to describe many of these effects! An important spin-off<br/>&gt;&gt; of these studies is the formulation of a neural network-based<br/>&gt; theory<br/>&gt;&gt; of harmony, as well as the explanation of many musical &quot;universals&quot;<br/>&gt;&gt; such as the role of the almighty octave, consonance and dissonance,<br/>&gt;&gt; etc.<br/>&gt;&gt; [end quote]<br/>&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;</p></div><h3><a id=79752 href="#79752">ðŸ”—</a>Andreas Sparschuh &#x3C;a_sparschuh@...&#x3E;</h3><span>1/7/2009 12:50:40 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;Jack&quot; &lt;gvr.jack@...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Here&apos;s a snippet from<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; <a href="http://www.acoustics.org/press/137th/roederer.html">http://www.acoustics.org/press/137th/roederer.html</a><br/>&gt; .....it was not until 15 years ago<br/>&gt; that in vivo measurements revealed the astounding fact that some of<br/>&gt; the acoustical detector cells on the basilar membrane have motility.<br/>&gt; They vibrate &quot;on their own power&quot; at acoustical frequencies and act<br/>&gt; as feedback-controlled &quot;electromechanical&quot; amplifiers of the external<br/>&gt; stimulus, thus greatly sharpening the resonance regions!
