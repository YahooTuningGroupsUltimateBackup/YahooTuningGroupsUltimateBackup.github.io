Things depend somewhat on the cardinality<br/>of the &quot;deficient&quot; chord.  In this case, we&apos;ve declared all dyads deficient<br/>from the start, so stellation will never terminate, regardless of the<br/>initial structure.  The same is obviously true when we consider single<br/>points deficient, or any range of cardinalities that includes 1 or 2, since<br/>three notes are required to distinguish o- and u-tonal structures in JI;<br/>the extra symmetry between them means you can&apos;t keep your points from<br/>participating in new incomplete chords.</p><p>Considering nothing smaller than a triad deficient, the shape of the<br/>structure may come into play.  On the oct. lattice, however, I believe<br/>all stellations terminate after a single interation when triads are<br/>considered deficient.</p><p>Let&apos;s explore.  We have, 3-&gt;4 in 1.</p><p>Now the question- has Wilson&apos;s structure terminated after 2 iterations?<br/>Let&apos;s say it has.  For the first iteration, 4-&gt;6.  But what was the<br/>cardinality of the incomplete chords at the second iteration?</p><p>[Chalmers]<br/>&gt;However, six new incomplete harmonic hexads are created by the addition<br/>&gt;of the first 30 tones above. These are formed by the notes E*E*F and<br/>&gt;F*F*E for all selections of 2 factors from the 6 of the generator. To<br/>&gt;complete these hexads, we must add 6 more tones of the form E*E*E to<br/>&gt;generate chordal sets such as A*E*E, B*E*E, C*E*E, D*E*E, F*E*E and<br/>&gt;E*E*E for all such combinations of the factors. This step adds 6 more<br/>&gt;tones and makes 86 in altogether.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;By symmetry, six more tones must be added to the 86 tones above to<br/>&gt;complete the subharmonic facets. I seem to be dense this AM and am not<br/>&gt;sure exactly what form these 6 tones must have. My guess is that they<br/>&gt;are of the form A*B*C*D*E, A*B*C*D*F, corresponding to Sub-F, Sub-E,<br/>&gt;etc. These tones raise the total to 92, in agreement with Erv&apos;s number.</p><p>As I&apos;ve been saying, we&apos;re running up against adjacent pentadekanies<br/>here, and completing the pentads to hexands (while ignoring the<br/>incomplete triads, I might add).  So if, as I suggested way back in this<br/>thread, we add 1 to m at each iteration, stellation terminates when m=n.<br/>For the hebdomekontany, we must add three tones to each chord at the<br/>first iteration, then two, and then 1 (again, ignoring the &quot;lesser&quot;<br/>deficient chords in the adjacent CPSs -- else, three, two and six, one<br/>and seven).</p><p>All this isn&apos;t worth the trouble.  Might as well just say, &quot;I&apos;m going<br/>to use the entire lattice&quot;.  The idea of the CPS as a structure providing<br/>&quot;special&quot; access to the relations in a tonespace looses all meaning.</p><p>-Carl</p></div><h3><a id=11008 href="#11008">ðŸ”—</a>Paul Erlich &#x3C;PERLICH@ACADIAN-ASSET.COM&#x3E;</h3><span>7/3/2000 6:55:49 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Hello from the Sears Tower, Chicago, IL!!!<br/>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@egroups.com">tuning@egroups.com</a>, &lt;MANUEL.OP.DE.COUL@E...&gt; wrote:</p><p>&gt; A completely stellated CPS is made by drawing with putting back!<br/>&gt; Why did nobody tell this before?<br/>&gt; (A normal CPS is made by drawing without putting back.)</p><p>Manuel, this doesn&apos;t seem to work.
