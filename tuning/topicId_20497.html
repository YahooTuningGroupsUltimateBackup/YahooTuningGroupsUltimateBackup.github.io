They<br/>&gt;did make it much easier for mathematicians to calculate<br/>&gt;interval-sizes, but (partly because Stevin&apos;s treatise was<br/>&gt;unpublished) no-one did so before the 1660s. There is an excellent<br/>&gt;account of Stevin&apos;s work in Floris Cohen, _Quantifying music: the<br/>&gt;science of music at the first stage of the Scientific Revolution,<br/>&gt;1580-1650_ (Dordrecht: D. Reidel, 1984); he makes it clear that<br/>&gt;Stevin didn&apos;t consider what he was describing as a temperament, but<br/>&gt;rather as the true mathematical foundation of the musical intervals<br/>&gt;-- that is, he didn&apos;t believe in the small-integer ratios of<br/>&gt;Pythagorean and just intonation at all. For the uptake in the later<br/>&gt;17th century, see Penelope Gouk, _Music, science and natural magic in<br/>&gt;seventeenth-century England_ (Yale U.P., 1999).<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;One of Gouk&apos;s arguments is that the natural philosophers of the Royal<br/>&gt;Society (etc.) believed in equal temperament because they tended to<br/>&gt;be gentleman-amateur musicians who typically played the viol. There<br/>&gt;is evidence that fretted instruments had been tuned (to a close<br/>&gt;approximation) to equal temperament from early in the 16th century;<br/>&gt;Mark Lindley has written a great deal about this and other practical<br/>&gt;tuning and temperament systems, and I won&apos;t single out a particular<br/>&gt;essay of his. It *may* be pertinent that in 1482 Bartolomeus Ramis de<br/>&gt;Pareia argued that the tritone is identical to the diminished 5th;<br/>&gt;this is strictly true only in equal temperament, but he may simply<br/>&gt;have been counting keys (he often cited the keyboard, sometimes<br/>&gt;specifically the organ, to illustrate his points).<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;Lassus&apos;s _Prophetiae Sibyllarum_ is a knotty problem, and I don&apos;t<br/>&gt;pretend to have a solution to it. I was exposed very early to William<br/>&gt;Mitchell&apos;s Schenkerian analysis of the prologue in _The Music Forum_<br/>&gt;(1970); I concur on the whole with Peter Bergquist&apos;s analysis<br/>&gt;recently posted. I want to comment specifically on the issue of<br/>&gt;&quot;chromaticism&quot;. This meant something entirely different in Lassus&apos;s<br/>&gt;time from what we normally understand today. When we talk about<br/>&gt;chromaticism we mean the 12-note semitonal octave. When Lassus&apos;s<br/>&gt;contemporaries (we don&apos;t have any verbal testimony from Lassus<br/>&gt;himself, only the music) referred to &quot;chromaticism&quot; they meant the<br/>&gt;chromatic genus of ancient Greek music, in which the octave is<br/>&gt;constituted from two chromatic tetrachords<br/>&gt;(semitone-semitone-semiditone) separated by a tone [1132113]. When<br/>&gt;Claude Le Jeune wrote &quot;Quelle eau&quot; (1585), &quot;Qu&apos;est devenu ce bel<br/>&gt;oeil&quot; (1608), and &quot;Hellas, mon Dieu&quot; (1612) he exemplified<br/>&gt;chromaticism *not* by saturating his pitch space with semitones but<br/>&gt;by expressing the chromatic tetrachord specifically. For Nicolo<br/>&gt;Vicentino, the minor 3rd was as much a diagnostic interval for<br/>&gt;chromaticism as the semitone, and this was the thrust of his famous<br/>&gt;(losing) debate with Vicente Lusitano in 1551 over whether the music<br/>&gt;of the time was diatonic or not.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;What Lassus was doing in the _Prophetiae_ (not just in the prologue)<br/>&gt;is *not* the same as what Le Jeune did. There are no expressions of<br/>&gt;the chromatic tetrachord, and precious few melodic minor 3rds;<br/>&gt;instead there are many chromatic semitones -- as distinct from<br/>&gt;diatonic semitones, though these are also present. The tuning of<br/>&gt;semitones in the 15th and 16th centuries is another difficult<br/>&gt;problem, which has been very little discussed.* In a nutshell,<br/>&gt;whether one is following Pythagorean or just intonation or any<br/>&gt;unequal temperament (such as one of the meantone alternatives), the<br/>&gt;diatonic semitone between B and C or between C-sharp and D is a<br/>&gt;different size to the chromatic semitone between C and C-sharp. In<br/>&gt;Pythagorean or just intonation the diatonic semitone is smaller than<br/>&gt;the chromatic; in meantone temperament it is larger. Lusitano&apos;s<br/>&gt;winning argument against Vicentino was that in normal music the<br/>&gt;chromatic semitone is never used, therefore music is diatonic.<br/>&gt;Composers immediately (if they hadn&apos;t already) proved him wrong, as<br/>&gt;they usually do with overgeneral theoretical pronouncements. Cipriano<br/>&gt;de Rore in particular wrote in 1555 a brilliant setting of Horace&apos;s<br/>&gt;_Calami sonum ferentes_ (about the invention of music from the sound<br/>&gt;of the wind in the reeds; I may have the wrong poet here, but it&apos;s<br/>&gt;one of the classic authors), which is based on an ascending semitone<br/>&gt;scale. There is some good stuff about late-16th- and 17th-century<br/>&gt;chromaticism in Eric Chafe, _Monteverdi&apos;s tonal language_ (NY:<br/>&gt;Schirmer, 1992).<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;I think the inequality of sung semitones (which must have been very<br/>&gt;demanding on the singers, though experience shows it is not<br/>&gt;unattainable; Vicentino called for microtones in some of his works)<br/>&gt;is significant to our understanding, not only of the sound of this<br/>&gt;music, but of the composers&apos; purposes. I have not undertaken a close<br/>&gt;analysis of these works myself, but if I did I should want to be<br/>&gt;extremely alert to the differing significance of diatonic and<br/>&gt;chromatic semitones in the voice-leading. I don&apos;t disagree with the<br/>&gt;harmonically-based analyses that have been posted before this, but I<br/>&gt;think they ought to be supplemented by attention to what the<br/>&gt;composers thought their &quot;chromaticism&quot; meant.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;*The real problem alluded to here is that there is evidence that<br/>&gt;singers (and players of instruments with flexible tuning) did not<br/>&gt;hold strictly to the basic tuning they were following. (The evidence<br/>&gt;that singers used an essentially just tuning rather than the<br/>&gt;Pythagorean goes back to Ramis in 1482 again, and is probably valid<br/>&gt;for about a generation earlier.) But there are other witnesses from<br/>&gt;the beginning of the 14th century (Marchettus of Padua) well into the<br/>&gt;16th (the preface to a French chanson publication of Lassus&apos;s time;<br/>&gt;I&apos;m afraid I&apos;ve mislaid the precise reference) that the supposedly<br/>&gt;diatonic semitone between a sharped note and the note above was<br/>&gt;narrower than the proper semitone (solmized fa-mi) between a flatted<br/>&gt;note and the note below, or between F and E or C and B. The extent of<br/>&gt;this narrowing is expressed differently by the different witnesses,<br/>&gt;but I conclude that singers were doing something essentially<br/>&gt;equivalent to the well-known phenomenon in which string players<br/>&gt;narrow their leading tones.

In a 12-tET tuning where<br/>G# and Ab are acoustically equivalent, this debate (in which Ramos<br/>finds Ab the more &quot;provident&quot; choice) would seem rather beside the<br/>point.</p><p>In the course of this discussion, Ramos argues that the utility of G#<br/>in an Eb-G# tuning is limited because there is no &quot;good&quot; fourth D#-G#,<br/>stating that Eb-G# does not form a proper fourth, as it would, of<br/>course, in 12-tET.</p><p>Further, he observes that some people like to satisfy both sides of<br/>the question by providing a keyboard instrument with keys for both Ab<br/>and G# -- the &quot;split-key accidentals&quot; of a kind advocated by certain<br/>early 15th-century theorists in a Pythagorean setting, and used in the<br/>Lucca organ of around 1480 (G#/Ab, and either Eb/D# or Bb/A# depending<br/>on which sources or interpretations one favors).</p><p>Like Lindley, I find his remarks very much in line with the hypothesis<br/>of the widespread use of meantone temperament by 1482, a practice<br/>expressly described by Gafurius in 1496, although not precisely<br/>quantified in terms of fractions of a syntonic comma until Zarlino<br/>(1558 and later). At any rate, he is evidently describing some tuning<br/>other than 12-tET.</p><p>A quick aside: the fine distinction between tritone and diminished<br/>fifth might or might not be made at various eras. Thus a typical<br/>13th-century reckoning based on Pythagorean intonation recognized a<br/>diatonic set of 13 simple intervals ranging from unison to octave,<br/>with a single category of tritone (_tritonus_). Around 1325, however,<br/>Jacobus of Liege pointed out that there were actually 14 such<br/>intervals, since the _semitritonus_ or diminished fifth had a<br/>different and smaller size of 1024:729 (~588.27 cents) than the<br/>_tritonus_ or augmented fourth at 729:512 (~611.73 cents).</p><p>&gt; I want to comment specifically on the issue of &quot;chromaticism&quot;. This<br/>&gt; meant something entirely different in Lassus&apos;s time from what we<br/>&gt; normally understand today. When we talk about chromaticism we mean<br/>&gt; the 12-note semitonal octave. When Lassus&apos;s contemporaries (we don&apos;t<br/>&gt; have any verbal testimony from Lassus himself, only the music)<br/>&gt; referred to &quot;chromaticism&quot; they meant the chromatic genus of ancient<br/>&gt; Greek music, in which the octave is constituted from two chromatic<br/>&gt; tetrachords (semitone-semitone-semiditone) separated by a tone<br/>&gt; [1132113].</p><p>Certainly the Greek chromatic genus was one defining concept in the 16th<br/>century, but not necessarily the only one. As Thomas Morley observes in<br/>1597, musicians such as organists often regarded a &quot;chromatic&quot; figure as<br/>one alternating diatonic and chromatic semitones in stepwise motion,<br/>giving the example in semibreves or whole-notes of E-F-F#-G-G#-A. Since<br/>the chromatic semitone might be considered the distinctive interval<br/>defining the chromatic genus, this looser sense has some connection to the<br/>stricter one. Morley himself remarks that a theme such as that he states<br/>&quot;is not right Chromatica, but ... patched up of half Chromatic, and half<br/>Diatonic.&quot;[3]</p><p>&gt; When Claude Le Jeune wrote &quot;Quelle eau&quot; (1585), &quot;Qu&apos;est devenu ce<br/>&gt; bel oeil&quot; (1608), and &quot;Hellas, mon Dieu&quot; (1612) he exemplified<br/>&gt; chromaticism *not* by saturating his pitch space with semitones but<br/>&gt; by expressing the chromatic tetrachord specifically. For Nicolo<br/>&gt; Vicentino, the minor 3rd was as much a diagnostic interval for<br/>&gt; chromaticism as the semitone, and this was the thrust of his famous<br/>&gt; (losing) debate with Vicente Lusitano in 1551 over whether the music<br/>&gt; of the time was diatonic or not.</p><p>Yes, Vicentino&apos;s thesis was that whenever a melodic minor third<br/>appeared, it marked a use of the chromatic genus, causing him to<br/>describe music of the common practice as _participata &amp; mista_, or<br/>&quot;tempered and mixed,&quot; featuring both the slight narrowing or<br/>&quot;blunting&quot; of the fifth characteristic of meantone, and the mixing of<br/>the genera. Zarlino (1558) condemned this opinion of the<br/>&quot;chromaticists,&quot; asserting that the chromatic semitone and enharmonic<br/>diesis rather than the minor and major third were the defining<br/>intervals of these two genera, with steps of a major or minor third<br/>belonging equally to the diatonic.</p><p>Vicentino also maintained that a strictly &quot;diatonic&quot; composition could<br/>not use _any_ accidental inflections such as sharps applied by<br/>composer or performer to obtain major sixths before octaves, etc. In<br/>contrast, Zarlino took for granted the use of &quot;justifiable&quot; and indeed<br/>necessary accidentals as a feature of normal diatonic style.</p><p>&gt; In Pythagorean or just intonation the diatonic semitone is smaller<br/>&gt; than the chromatic; in meantone temperament it is larger.</p><p>Indeed in Pythagorean intonation, the diatonic semitone or limma<br/>(256:243, ~90.22 cents) is smaller than the chromatic semitone or<br/>apotome (2187:2048, ~113.69 cents), while in meantone, e.g. 1/4-comma<br/>with pure 5:4 major thirds, the diatonic semitone (~117.11 cents) is<br/>larger than the chromatic (~76.05 cents).</p><p>However, for &quot;just intonation&quot; taken in the sense of a system based on<br/>pure ratios of 3 and 5 (as in the systems of Fogliano in 1529 and<br/>Zarlino in 1558), as for meantone, the diatonic semitone is larger,<br/>most typically 16:15 (~111.73 cents), than the chromatic semitone,<br/>most typically 25:24 (~70.67 cents). These semitone sizes vary,<br/>because of the use of differently sized whole-tones at 9:8 and 10:9,<br/>but with the diatonic semitone characteristically larger.</p><p>&gt; Lusitano&apos;s winning argument against Vicentino was that in normal<br/>&gt; music the chromatic semitone is never used, therefore music is<br/>&gt; diatonic.  Composers immediately (if they hadn&apos;t already) proved him<br/>&gt; wrong, as they usually do with overgeneral theoretical<br/>&gt; pronouncements.</p><p>Interestingly, the first bold use of what is sometimes termed &quot;direct<br/>chromaticism&quot; -- the use of a chromatic semitone as a melodic step --<br/>in Western European polyphonic music may be the practice of Marchettus<br/>of Padua and some of his colleagues during the early 14th century,<br/>described and advocated in his _Lucidarium_ of 1318, and also<br/>documented in some compositions from this epoch cited by Jan<br/>Herlinger.[4]</p><p>However, according to much conventional theory, the apotome or<br/>chromatic semitone was &quot;unsingable,&quot; and this view is expressed as<br/>late as 1565 by Tomas de Santa Maria in a treatise on four-voice<br/>keyboard textures and the art of _fantasia_ or improvisation, where he<br/>further cautions that &quot;what cannot be sung cannot be played.&quot; As you<br/>rightly note, the experimental compositions of Lasso, Rore, and others<br/>of this same era might serve as counterexamples.</p><p>As far as the Vicentino-Lusitano debate goes, I might award the formal<br/>and narrow issue of the disputation to Lusitano (a melodic leap of a<br/>minor third as tone-plus-diatonic-semitone, or of a major third as a<br/>&quot;ditone&quot; or tone-plus-tone, seems routinely diatonic to me).</p><p>However, I would emphatically join Vicentino in celebrating the<br/>artistic merits and possibilities of polyphonic music using the steps<br/>of the chromatic semitone and enharmonic diesis -- the latter<br/>fortuitously and felicitously realized by the usual meantone diesis of<br/>128:125 (~41.06 cents), about 1/5-tone. Based on my own experience<br/>with a 24-note archicembalo (or the synthesizer equivalent) in<br/>1/4-comma meantone as a subset of Vicentino&apos;s full instrument with 36<br/>or 38 notes per octave, I would say that his germinal contributions<br/>leave immense scope for further exploration.</p><p>Maybe the Vicentino-Lusitano affair is an example of how great<br/>aesthetic controversies can focus on issues not always so happily<br/>defined.</p><p>&gt; I don&apos;t disagree with the harmonically-based analyses that have been<br/>&gt; posted before this, but I think they ought to be supplemented by<br/>&gt; attention to what the composers thought their &quot;chromaticism&quot; meant.</p><p>As someone looking at 16th-century music from something of a<br/>medievalist perspective (which means maybe that my 14th-century biases<br/>and other people&apos;s 18th-century biases may average out to a balanced<br/>analysis &lt;grin&gt;), I would focus on such things as the theme of<br/>&quot;closest approach&quot; progressions by contrary motion such as m3-1, M3-5,<br/>M6-8 as they guide motion between the pervasive tertian sonorities of<br/>the newer style.</p><p>Scholars such as Richard Crocker and Carl Dahlhaus have emphasized<br/>this point, and I might describe the 13th-16th century approach as one<br/>of &quot;combinative verticality,&quot; with two-voice intervals as the<br/>elementary particles, but with a three-note unit of complete<br/>sonority.</p><p>In Gothic music, this unit is Johannes de Grocheio&apos;s _trina harmoniae<br/>perfectio_ or &quot;threefold perfection of harmony&quot; expressed by the<br/>combination of outer octave, lower fifth, and upper fourth<br/>(e.g. d-a-d&apos; or D3-A3-D4 in MIDI notation), which another theorist<br/>writing in the same era around 1300 derives from the series of ratios<br/>2-3-4. Interestingly, this &quot;natural&quot; series with 2:3 fifth below 4:3<br/>fourth coincides with the modern frequency ratio of 2:3:4; the<br/>medieval string ratio is 12:8:6 or 6:4:3.</p><p>By the second quarter of the 16th century, it is clearly what Zarlino<br/>terms _harmonia perfetta_, &quot;the third plus fifth or sixth,&quot; ideally<br/>outer fifth, lower major third, and upper minor third, with a string<br/>ratio of 15:12:10 and a frequency ratio of 4:5:6.</p><p>In my view, an analysis of 16th-century music, chromatic or otherwise,<br/>should approach the vertical dimension in terms of directed two-voice<br/>progressions (some borrowed from earlier Gothic practice and theory,<br/>others new) and in terms of the different combinations and<br/>arrangements of _harmonia perfetta_, with Zarlino&apos;s remarks on these<br/>points providing one valuable outlook. Also, Vicentino and Santa Maria<br/>bring their own vital perspectives to this question, and I&apos;ve found<br/>that the latter&apos;s four-voice patterns and progressions can be relevant<br/>for analyzing a range of 16th-century pieces, especially those<br/>involving note-against-note textures.</p><p>&gt; *The real problem alluded to here is that there is evidence that<br/>&gt; singers (and players of instruments with flexible tuning) did not<br/>&gt; hold strictly to the basic tuning they were following. (The evidence<br/>&gt; that singers used an essentially just tuning rather than the<br/>&gt; Pythagorean goes back to Ramis in 1482 again, and is probably valid<br/>&gt; for about a generation earlier.)</p><p>As Bill Alves has aptly emphasized on the Tuning list, flexible<br/>intonation is indeed flexible, so that a tuning for fixed-pitch<br/>instruments is a model rather than a definition of what an ensemble<br/>may actually do.</p><p>Here I would agree that &quot;about a generation&quot; before the treatise of<br/>Ramos, or around 1450, is a very reasonable date for a shift from<br/>Pythagorean to meantone tuning for keyboards, and to some<br/>approximation of just intonation based on ratios of 3 and 5 (i.e. 5:4<br/>and 6:5 thirds) for singers and players of flexible-pitch<br/>instruments.</p><p>The problem of intonation in the era of the Gothic-Renaissance<br/>transition, arguably making up most of the 15th century, is an<br/>intriguing one. For the era of the young Dufay (say 1420-1450), I<br/>would be inclined with Mark Lindley to posit some kind of modified<br/>Pythagorean tuning with smoother &quot;schisma thirds&quot; (diminished fourths<br/>and augmented seconds with ratios very close to 5:4 and 6:5) used for<br/>certain sonorities, especially prolonged noncadential ones.</p><p>Experimenting with a 15-16 note Pythagorean tuning on two synthesizer<br/>manuals (one in the likely typical Eb-G# of the 14th century, or<br/>Bb-D#, the other in the popular Gb-B tuning of the early 15th<br/>century), I&apos;ve found myself agreeing with Prosdocimus de Beldemandis<br/>(1413) and Ugolino of Orvieto (c. 1425-1440?) in favoring regular and<br/>active Pythagorean thirds and sixths for cadences in the &quot;classic&quot;<br/>14th-century manner combining M6-8 and M3-5 (e.g. E-G#-C# to D-A-D).<br/>At the same time, noncadential schisma third sonorities like E-Ab-B<br/>(written E-G#-B) can have a beguiling effect which to my ears very<br/>much evokes the fresh new aura of the Dufay era.</p><p>Lindley suggests 1450 as an approximate date for the transition to<br/>meantone, with the compositions of Conrad Paumann for keyboard and the<br/>vocal works of the later Dufay and Ockeghem favoring such a system<br/>with a consistent use of pure or near-pure thirds.</p><p>However, some scholars lean toward the view that singers may have<br/>still often favored a somewhat &quot;Pythagorean&quot; approach in the middle to<br/>late 15th century, so that the kind of theoretical disarray discussed<br/>by Lindley may reflect the transitional nature of practice as well as<br/>conceptual models.</p><p>For example, singers may have at times leaned toward the compact<br/>diatonic semitones of the Pythagorean tradition, and at other times<br/>toward smoother vertical thirds and sixths, for example in resolving<br/>the suspension dissonances playing a central role in the new style.</p><p>&gt; But there are other witnesses from the beginning of the 14th century<br/>&gt; (Marchettus of Padua) well into the 16th (the preface to a French<br/>&gt; chanson publication of Lassus&apos;s time; I&apos;m afraid I&apos;ve mislaid the<br/>&gt; precise reference) that the supposedly diatonic semitone between a<br/>&gt; sharped note and the note above was narrower than the proper<br/>&gt; semitone (solmized fa-mi) between a flatted note and the note below,<br/>&gt; or between F and E or C and B.</p><p>The expression of such views by Renaissance theorists is very<br/>interesting, and I&apos;d love to learn more about this.</p><p>What you describe is a very apt summary of Marchettus, who indeed<br/>advocates the use of an extra-narrow cadential semitone or &quot;diesis&quot; in<br/>certain directed vertical progressions from an unstable to a stable<br/>interval by stepwise contrary motion (specifically M3-5, M6-8, or<br/>M10-12).</p><p>In his fivefold division of the tone -- with at least one passage<br/>suggesting to both Jan Herlinger and me that he may have meant a<br/>division into five _equal_ dieses -- a usual mi-fa semitone such as<br/>E-F or B-C is &quot;two parts&quot; of the tone, possibly 2/5-tone, and the<br/>usual apotome (e.g. Bb-B, or German B-H) &quot;three parts,&quot; possibly<br/>3/5-tone.</p><p>In contrast, a cadential diesis such as G#-A is only &quot;one part&quot; of the<br/>tone, possibly 1/5-tone, or about half the size of a usual semitone<br/>step. The complementary &quot;chroma&quot; or &quot;chromatic semitone,&quot; e.g. G-G#,<br/>is thus equal to the remaining &quot;four parts,&quot; possibly 4/5-tone.</p><p>Note that Marchettus is addressing vocalists, who could made small<br/>adjustments to achieve these different step sizes while maintaining or<br/>closely approximating the pure Pythagorean ratios which Marchettus<br/>makes part of his system (2:1 octave, 3:2 fifth, 4:3 fourth, 9:8<br/>whole-tone).</p><p>In a keyboard tuning system, one must make some compromises one way or<br/>another -- this is not a theoretical flaw, only a limitation of<br/>modelling vocal intonation on a fixed-pitch instrument.</p><p>One moot question may be whether Marchettus, in advocating his<br/>extra-narrow diesis specifically for progressions with _ascending_<br/>semitones involving _musica ficta_ (mi-signs or sharps outside the<br/>Guidonian gamut of the diatonic notes plus Bb), may in part be<br/>reflecting notational concerns.</p><p>He advocates a distinction between the usual &quot;square-B&quot; sign (like a<br/>modern natural sign) showing a note below a normal semitone step such<br/>as B-C, and a special diesis sign (somewhat like a modern sharp)<br/>showing at once a semitone alteration and his special division of the<br/>tone into _chroma_ and diesis (e.g. G-G#-A).</p><p>In usual practice, both types of signs are often used interchangeably<br/>as &quot;mi-signs&quot; showing a note below a semitone. Marchettus proposes<br/>that the diesis sign be reserved specifically to show his special<br/>chroma/diesis division.</p><p>Thus his system permits a notated distinction between regular<br/>semitones and special cadential ones using signs already familiar. To<br/>show a similar chroma/diesis division for _descending_ semitones, he<br/>would have had to invent a new kind of &quot;fa-sign&quot; in addition to the<br/>established &quot;round-B&quot; sign (the source of the modern flat). Of course,<br/>one could reply, &quot;If he wanted his special semitones in cadences with<br/>descending semitonal inflections (e.g. Eb-D), or in such progressions<br/>within the regular or _musica recta_ gamut, he could have invented<br/>appropriate signs, or at least described such a practice.&quot;</p><p>The Berkeley Manuscript or Paris Anonymous of around 1375 -- part of<br/>it dated to that year -- includes one treatise advocating that singers<br/>intone a usual mi-fa semitone as 2/3-tone, but a cadential semitone as<br/>1/3-tone. Oliver Ellsworth has interpreted this statement, directly<br/>addressing only the finding of semitones for singers, not polyphony or<br/>vertical intervals, as suggesting 19-tone equal temperament (19-tET),<br/>the system used and described about two centuries later by Costeley<br/>(1570).[5]</p><p>However one interprets these 14th-century statements and systems --<br/>another topic -- they do suggest a distinction for some musicians<br/>between cadential and other semitones. Here I should emphasize that I<br/>use &quot;cadential&quot; (from _cadentia_) in the medieval sense of Jacobus of<br/>Liege: a progression from a more tense or unstable interval to a<br/>stable one, not necessarily limited to the end of a phrase or the<br/>like.</p><p>While accentuated cadential progressions with narrower-than-usual<br/>semitones seem to me a not-unlikely practice in various eras and<br/>places, I&apos;m not sure about any consistent tendency to make ascending<br/>cadential semitones narrower than descending ones. For theorists such<br/>as Prosdocimus and Ugolino in the earlier 15th century, these<br/>semitones should be the same size in either direction, and I have<br/>heard reports that performers may tend to narrow certain semitones in<br/>_either_ direction (e.g. either C#-D or Eb-D).</p><p>-----<br/>Notes<br/>-----</p><p>1.
