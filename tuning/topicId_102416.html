The reason is that the intervals useful for harmony (such as 11/8 or 11/9) and melody (11/10, 12/11) are so complex that their actual error can be huge. I prefer the results I get from optimizing the superparticular intervals.</p><p>My grade A temperament list includes domineering, septimal, dominant, ferrier, porcupine, keemun, mohajira, magic, orwell, hitchcock, miracle, catakleismic, wizard, unidec, harry, supers, octoid, pogo, hemiennealimmal, abigail, and hemienneadecal. Meantone doesn&apos;t do as well as you might expect, at grade C, but that&apos;s still pretty good as far as temperaments go.

Basically I&apos;m optimizing for all the superparticular intervals from 2/1 to 12/11, without weighting. The practical result of that is that the smaller primes automatically get more weight (since they occur more frequently as factors), but also greater importance is given to the small melodic intervals (which are more sensitive to mistuning), as opposed to theoretical consonances like 11/1.</p><p>I also use a different measure for complexity, although it doesn&apos;t have a lot of theoretical justification. It does agree pretty well with my intuition as far as which temperaments are more complex, but I still might consider tweaking it if I can come up with better results.</p></div>
