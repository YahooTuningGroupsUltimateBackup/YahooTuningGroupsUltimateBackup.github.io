S. B. Woolhouse:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; <a href="http://tonalsoft.com/monzo/woolhouse/essay.htm">http://tonalsoft.com/monzo/woolhouse/essay.htm</a><br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; look under the section &quot;730-EDO as a basic unit&quot;:</p><p>I knew the idea of looking at the octave (or any other period) as a circle divisible into arcs is too obviously to have originated with some guy in early 21st century Texas. I remember reading about someone who did that long ago, and Harrison&apos;s pi-based meantone also comes to mind.</p><p>Now about 730-tone. The fifth is 427 degrees, the third is 235. It&apos;s weak in 7- and 11-limit, however: 7/4 is 589 and 11/8 is 335, but both intervals are a third of a degree sharp. 665-tone (fifth = 389, third = 214) has a decent approximation of 7/4 (537 degrees), though 11/8 is horrible, almost exactly halfway between 305 and 306.</p><p>The comma in 730-tone is 13 degrees, while in 665-tone it&apos;s 12 degrees, which of course is divisible by 3 and 4. I&apos;m wondering why Woolhouse liked 7/26-comma meantone so much (it of course lies between third- and quarter-comma).</p><p>&lt;vanity&gt;Now here&apos;s a meantone I like: set the generator to 697.085365 cents (lower the fifth by one-sixth of 896/729), so the augmented fourth is 7/5. 105-TET is great for this.&lt;/vanity&gt;</p><p>~Danny~</p></div><h3>Danny Wier &#x3C;dawiertx@sbcglobal.net&#x3E;</h3><span>4/30/2005 8:58:28 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>&gt; &lt;vanity&gt;Now here&apos;s a meantone I like: set the generator to 697.085365 &gt; cents<br/>&gt; (lower the fifth by one-sixth of 896/729)</p><p>I meant 3584/3645, which is the difference between 729/512 and 7/5.
