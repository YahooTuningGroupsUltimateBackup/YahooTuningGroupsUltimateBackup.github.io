We are still compiling the data and refrain until it is complete but<br/>the evidence is very convincing. The pieces using Santour, harmonium, and Koto are the three<br/>in question.</p><p>Joseph Pehrson wrote:</p><p>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; However, no practical scale IN EXISTENCE has ever used these kinds of<br/>&gt; mathematical constructs.
