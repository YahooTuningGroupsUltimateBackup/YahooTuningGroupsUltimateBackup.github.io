One then<br/>&gt; just uses a resonator formula. For mallets one can use ping pong table<br/>&gt; mallets with a little bit of foam added. Although Keenan 21 MOS<br/>&gt; provides more than enough material for a lifetime. You would be<br/>&gt; venturing down the 72 ET path which means that you could always add on<br/>&gt; to it investigate other things possible in 72.

I rather fancy the idea of a gamelan<br/>composition with rhythmic lines in all sorts of motion, oblique,<br/>parallel and contrary, and these amazing beatless chords pop out and zap<br/>the audience into a bliss state. Well, something along those lines.</p><p>Best Wishes</p></div>
