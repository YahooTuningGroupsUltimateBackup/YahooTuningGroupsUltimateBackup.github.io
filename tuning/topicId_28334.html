I&apos;m still tuning up steel bars and I seem to remember John Starrett<br/>recommending various tuners. I also remember someone saying that it<br/>would be difficult to tune bars, with their inharmonic partials, to some<br/>of the higher prime limits. Can anyone recommend a tuner or tuners (or<br/>send me to suitable websites) that would be suitable for tuning metal<br/>(and wooden) bars accurately? I have &apos;Blackjack&apos; in mind.  At the<br/>moment  I&apos;m stretching too many favours  by borrrowing gear and need to<br/>buy my own. I note that Lydia Ayers in 1/1 speaks of the Woodstock chime<br/>company as having excellent tuning facilities for  metal bars.  I&apos;ll be<br/>buying in the UK so.....</p><p>2. A former guitar student of mine returned to NYC a couple of years<br/>ago, Manhattan to be precise. Luckily he&apos;s alive and well and as we<br/>exchange emails he tells me that he can&apos;t find a good guitar teacher.<br/>He&apos;s been through three already. I know it&apos;s a bit banal but let&apos;s help<br/>to make someone happy? Any recommendations anyone?</p><p>Thanks in anticipation.</p><p>Best Wishes.</p></div><h3>jpehrson@rcn.com</h3><span>9/23/2001 1:44:27 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In tuning@y..., Alison Monteith &lt;alison.monteith3@w...&gt; wrote:</p><p><a href="http://groups.yahoo.com/group/tuning/message/28334">http://groups.yahoo.com/group/tuning/message/28334</a></p><p>&gt;<br/>&gt; 2.

However, there<br/>is still no telephone service to much of Manhattan (people survive<br/>with e-mail!) and there are *lots* of police and military vehicles<br/>around everyplace...   And that doesn&apos;t include Ground Zero....<br/>the &quot;war zone...&quot;</p><p>I don&apos;t even want to go down there...</p><p>__________ ________ _________<br/>Joseph Pehrson</p></div>
