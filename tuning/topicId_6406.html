No!<br/>I&apos;m no Manheim Steamroller! But I thinbk you&apos;ll enjoy these. And if any of<br/>you can find any way to retune such files, fantastic. This is in thanks for<br/>the wonderful time I&apos;ve had so far on this list.</p></div><h3>John A. deLaubenfels &#x3C;jadl@xxxxxx.xxxx&#x3E;</h3><span>12/1/1999 2:22:44 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>[Jay Williams, TD 409.10:]<br/>&gt; Not that this hasta do much with tunings, really, but I though I&apos;d<br/>&gt; force upon any of you MIDIots, a sample of my Christmas Carol<br/>&gt; arrangements.</p><p>I&apos;ve got mine, and it&apos;s real nice!  Hey, everybody, if we all e-mail<br/>Jay and ask for one, we can keep him busy for awhile, AND get some good<br/>music!  It&apos;s creative arrangements, many of them medleys, of familiar<br/>songs, plus one cut of Jay&apos;s own composition.</p><p>Even I, fanatic for 7-limit JI that I am, believe that the main energy<br/>in music, or lack of it, is not tuning-related.  So, I &quot;forgive&quot; Jay<br/>for working in 12-tET.  (Paul, this paragraph is &quot;off the record.&quot;).</p><p>&gt; And if any of you can find any way to retune such files, fantastic.</p><p>That&apos;d be a challenge, retuning a .wav file!  In theory, one could do an<br/>FFT, move the peaks, then do a reverse FFT, but I doubt the sound would<br/>survive intact.  Does anybody know how good this kind of trick can get,<br/>and who, if anybody, does it?</p><p>JdL</p></div>
