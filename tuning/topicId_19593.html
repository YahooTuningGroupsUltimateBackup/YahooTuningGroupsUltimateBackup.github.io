They&apos;ll use<br/>&gt; common instead of natural logarithms.  That should be pointed out.<br/>&gt; Something like &quot;if your calculator has an &grave;ln&apos; key, use that instead<br/>&gt; of the &grave;log&apos; key&quot;.</p><p>Okay, I&apos;ve updated it:<br/><a href="http://homepage.ntlworld.com/robertwalker/tree/tree.htm">http://homepage.ntlworld.com/robertwalker/tree/tree.htm</a></p><p>&quot;Here the base of the exp and log have to match - either use use exp and<br/>ln (natural log) - i.e. the exp and ln buttons on your calculator, or use<br/>10^x with log(x).</p><p>Both work equally well: e^((cents/1200)*ln 2) = 10^((cents/1200)*log 2)<br/>&quot;</p><p>AS for text version of the FAQ, I took it for granted that we meant<br/>the type of FAQ one comes across often on web sites and reads on-line,<br/>but if one needs to have it in text form too, one would have to convert<br/>the superscripts (as I have in this post).</p><p>I suppose that is something to consider while planning the FAQ.</p><p>For example, I imagine it would be nice to have musical clips and graphics,<br/>but if it is text only, one is restricted to ascii diagrams, and using ascii note<br/>values for musical examples.</p><p>If one does it in html, then javascript is by far the most likely to<br/>be supported - it doesn&apos;t even need java - the name is a misnomer as it<br/>isn&apos;t really java at all, but a script language that uses some features<br/>of c, and some of java, and some of its own, which is especially easy to use<br/>in html pages. If you disable java you can still run it. I think any modern<br/>browser would run it.</p><p>Though you won&apos;t be able to use the tree menu, as that does use java.<br/>So if one wanted that in the FAQ, one needs to have an alternative available too.</p><p>For example, one could use the tree structure across the top of the window.<br/>with &gt; signs (like the one in Google) as a second level of navigation of the<br/>same site - if you click on one of the underlined texts in it, you get<br/>a list of all the entries in that branch of the tree.</p><p>The reason for suggesting the tree is that it could be useful for keeping track of<br/>the faq while in progress, so everyone can look at it, and see the latest<br/>versions of all the drafts, even if they are hosted in a number of web sites.</p><p>One could decide later what is the best navigation system for the final<br/>FAQ. Maybe a tree again, but maybe some other method would work better.</p><p>This particular tree is very clearly laid out and easy to maintain, basically<br/>just a list of urls.</p><p>Here it is in fact:</p><p>Cents to from ratios$1$$$How to convert ratios to cents and back<br/>Cents to ratios and back again$2$cents_to_from_ratios.htm$main$Converting cents to ratios<br/>and back.<br/>Meantone in cents$2$mean_tone_in_cents.htm$main$How to find meantone scale in cents<br/>Ratios with factors$2$ratios_with_factors.htm$main$Finding ratios for cents, including or<br/>excluding factors</p><p>The dollar signs are separators. The $2$ is the level of nesting. The<br/>text on the left is the one you see on the tree, and the one on the right<br/>is the one that shows at the bottom of the window when the mouse hovers<br/>over the link.</p><p>When there is no html link specified, then the entry is a folder instead.</p><p>I offer these javascript pages for the FAQ if one would like them, and feel<br/>they could possibly be helpful to newbies, at least, that was the motivation<br/>for them.</p><p>If anyone has disabled Java and wants to see them without using the tree control<br/><a href="http://homepage.ntlworld.com/robertwalker/tree/html_tree.htm">http://homepage.ntlworld.com/robertwalker/tree/html_tree.htm</a></p><p>Robert</p></div><h3>Graham Breed &#x3C;graham@microtonal.co.uk&#x3E;</h3><span>3/1/2001 4:56:30 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Robert Walker wrote:</p><p>&gt; Okay, I&apos;ve updated it:<br/>&gt; <a href="http://homepage.ntlworld.com/robertwalker/tree/tree.htm">http://homepage.ntlworld.com/robertwalker/tree/tree.htm</a><br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &quot;Here the base of the exp and log have to match - either use use<br/>exp and<br/>&gt; ln (natural log) - i.e. the exp and ln buttons on your calculator,<br/>or use<br/>&gt; 10^x with log(x).<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Both work equally well: e^((cents/1200)*ln 2) =<br/>10^((cents/1200)*log 2)<br/>&gt; &quot;</p><p>That looks fine, although I don&apos;t see the update.</p><p>&gt; AS for text version of the FAQ, I took it for granted that we meant<br/>&gt; the type of FAQ one comes across often on web sites and reads<br/>on-line,<br/>&gt; but if one needs to have it in text form too, one would have to<br/>convert<br/>&gt; the superscripts (as I have in this post).</p><p>FAQs were originally Usenet things, and plain text.
