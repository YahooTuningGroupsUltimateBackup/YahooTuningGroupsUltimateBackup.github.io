This study suggests that at least some vocal ensembles<br/>tend to tune major and minor thirds at around 5:4 and 6:5 when singing<br/>such monophonic chants.</p><p>This empirical approach merits much praise, and the finding seems<br/>unexpected not only from the viewpoint of a 3-limit medievalist<br/>approach, but from the viewpoint of much modern tuning theory which<br/>proposes that musicians tend to prefer 3-limit (Pythagorean) just<br/>intonation (JI) for unaccompanied melody where harmonic considerations<br/>do not apply.</p><p>There are a number of hypotheses which might be or indeed have been<br/>proposed here to explain the finding of this study:</p><p>(1) One might suggest that in fact 5:4 and 6:5 thirds are &quot;natural<br/>attractants&quot; to singers in &quot;pure melody&quot; as well as in a wide range of<br/>styles of polyphony.</p><p>(2) One might suggest more generally that singers tend to seek<br/>small-integer ratios. This raises a question as to whether the 7:4<br/>minor seventh, for example, might in practice occur when singers are<br/>performing repertories usually considered &quot;3-limit&quot; or &quot;5-limit.&quot;</p><p>(3) One might argue, as people already have, that certain kinds of<br/>acoustical spaces in effect transform monophonic chant into a kind of<br/>polyphony by prolonging the reverberation of the notes and their<br/>partials. It then becomes of interest to compare vocal intonations,<br/>possibly by the same ensemble, in different environments.</p><p>(4) One might raise the question as to whether intonational style in<br/>Gregorian chant or other monophonic singing may considerably vary<br/>between ensembles, possibly influenced by such factors as whether a<br/>group also performs medieval and/or later polyphony, and so on. Of<br/>course, in any case, the fact that an ensemble performs monophonic<br/>chant with a &quot;5-limit&quot; tuning is itself very interesting.</p><p>(5) One might join Bill Alves in seeking more specifics about ranges<br/>of intonational variation, etc. It&apos;s good in any case to be reminded<br/>early and often that the voice need not, and indeed _cannot_, be a<br/>fixed-pitch instrument. The variation on the order of magnitude of 15<br/>cents which he suggests is roughly 2/3 of a syntonic comma (81:80,<br/>~21.51 cents).</p><p>A final, more personal note. Early this evening, while reflecting on<br/>this very engaging empirical approach, I was improvising in<br/>more-or-less late 14th-century style on a Pythagorean keyboard, one<br/>manual like a usual &quot;harpsichord&quot; sound and the other maybe a bit like<br/>a harpsichord &quot;harp stop&quot; (or lute stop). It was wonderful, and I<br/>could move around the JI system without any of the complications often<br/>discussed here for 5-limit.</p><p>What struck me is that whether or not medieval singers actually came<br/>very close to 3-limit in their plainsong and polyphony, the theorists<br/>have described a _beautiful_ just intonation system for keyboards. It<br/>was almost like going back and sitting at what might have been one of<br/>the first &quot;harpsichord-like&quot; instruments around the end of the 14th<br/>century, not that those instruments offered anything as luxurious as<br/>two four-octave manuals.</p><p>If I had wanted to use ab-eb -- it didn&apos;t occur to me to get this<br/>adventurous -- I would have split the manuals between the usual g# and<br/>an ab, but for my usual improvisation, the issue didn&apos;t even occur to<br/>me. Would people here describe a 3-limit system as a plane or a<br/>cylinder? -- anyway, it was a delight.</p><p>At one point, for fun, I tried c#-f (8192:6561 in 3-limit, only 1.95<br/>cents from 5:4), and found that it sounded a bit &quot;strange.&quot; This was a<br/>bit like being on the other side of some &quot;lattice barrier&quot; or the<br/>like, although I&apos;m still not quite sure just what that tagline means.</p><p>Anyway, with all the JI systems which are reportedly much more<br/>difficult to implement on a fixed-pitch keyboard than to approximate<br/>with voices, it would be curious if classic 3-limit JI turns out to be<br/>easier for keyboards than for singers, maybe even medieval singers.</p><p>Possibly it was even symbolic in a way that I chose to improvise in a<br/>style inspired by recordings of late 14th-century music, an epoch<br/>often termed the _Ars subtilior_ or Manneristic epoch (of the Gothic<br/>era, that is, there also being the Mannerism of the 16th and 17th<br/>centuries).</p><p>Mannerism has sometimes been defined as the technique of artfully<br/>distorting rather than simply imitating nature. Could 3-limit tuning<br/>be in this category: a deviation from the likeliest vocal intonation<br/>which has a special beauty both mathematical and musical for one of<br/>the most exquisite polyphonic repertories of all time?</p><p>Most respectfully,</p><p>Margo Schulter<br/><a href="mailto:mschulter@value.net">mschulter@value.net</a></p></div><h3><a id=3521 href="#3521">ðŸ”—</a>Brett Barbaro &#x3C;barbaro@xxxxxxxxx.xxxx&#x3E;</h3><span>6/10/1999 7:12:29 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Margo Schulter wrote,</p><p>&gt;Would people here describe a 3-limit system as a plane or a<br/>&gt;cylinder?</p><p>It&apos;s just a line, of course (think about it!), unless you use the schisma<br/>thirds for 5-limit, in which case it&apos;s a cylinder.</p></div>
