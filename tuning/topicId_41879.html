You get it from the Hayden Planetarium site,<br/>where you can also get a 3D atlas of the milky way, but you dont need that<br/>to get the program. (get it though, its way cool). Anyway, download the<br/>program and the manual data, so you can open the program with a simple cubic<br/>array to get the feel of it. Has a very slick look and feel to it. You click<br/>on the array and &quot;toss&quot; it and it starts rotating, or you can fly through<br/>the array, or orbit a point of interest- that kind of thing. Of course,<br/>download the pdf of the manual too. Oh, I almost forgot:</p><p><a href="http://www.haydenplanetarium.org/hp/vo/du/products.html">http://www.haydenplanetarium.org/hp/vo/du/products.html</a></p><p>Monz, I bet you could have some fun with this one fer sure.</p><p>Dante</p></div>
