It comes with a<br/>CD-ROM with SARA and a lot of example databases, though you need MCL Lisp<br/>to run it.</p><p>The very brief idea behind SARA, as Cope explains it in the book, is a kind<br/>of super-generalization of the 18th century musical dice game, where one<br/>could assemble realistic-sounding piano pieces by choosing from a list of<br/>possible first measures, second measures, and so on. So all the possible<br/>first measures would be in the tonic, the fourths a half-cadence, the<br/>eighths a full cadence, and so on.</p><p>SARA takes the same idea that some musical fragments can be analyzed as<br/>&quot;fitting&quot; hierarchically with others, based on things like melodic<br/>direction, the fragment&apos;s &quot;significance&quot; as a distinctive marker of the<br/>style, and a kind of Schenkerian reduction of the fragment&apos;s place in an<br/>overall phrase and form. (Naturally this process works best with music that<br/>can be successfully analyzed in this way.)</p><p>SARA is not so simple that you just pour in a lot of pieces and it starts<br/>spewing out variations on them. You have to select the pieces very<br/>carefully, break it down into fragments (choosing the right length for<br/>fragments is key), do all the analysis, and carefully choose from the<br/>output.</p><p>It is a very subjective process, which is something most press accounts<br/>have glossed over if they mentioned it at all. People are most astonished<br/>that a computer can &quot;compose&quot; music in the style of Mozart (or whomever).<br/>Personally, I think that the computer is mainly rearranging (very<br/>intelligently, of course) notes that Mozart wrote based on David Cope&apos;s<br/>analysis of Mozart&apos;s style. Even then, Cope throws away many pages of<br/>output for every one he retains.</p><p>Could SARA work for non-12TET pieces? Well, it works pretty well for Bach<br/>and Mozart. It does treat all enharmonics as equivalent, though, if I<br/>remember right. If the tuning would work in 12 or fewer pitches per octave,<br/>I don&apos;t see why it wouldn&apos;t work, but SARA doesn&apos;t really know anything<br/>about the tuning. It deals with note numbers and rhythms, not what<br/>harmonies sound like.</p><p>To be most useful, SARA would normally have a database of fragments from a<br/>large number of closely related pieces, transposed to the same tonic (if<br/>tonal) and in the same meter. This is not to say that interesting results<br/>could not be found by deliberately creating &quot;hybrids&quot; by mixing composers<br/>or styles. Cope has done a little of that, mixing Stravinsky and Mahler for<br/>example.</p><p>If you had a large database compiled of a composer&apos;s 10TET pieces, I<br/>imagine it would work fine. Any logic to the 10TET harmonies would probably<br/>be retained and reproduced in the same way that it recreates the logic<br/>behind Bach chorales. I don&apos;t know of any composer who has written a lot of<br/>10TET pieces, though (much less in the same meter and general style).</p><p>Best of luck.</p><p>Bill</p><p>^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^<br/>^ Bill Alves                                      email: <a href="mailto:alves@hmc.edu">alves@hmc.edu</a> ^<br/>^ Harvey Mudd College                 URL: <a href="http://www2.hmc.edu/~alves/">http://www2.hmc.edu/~alves/</a> ^<br/>^ 301 E.
