CNMI has been established by Patrick Ozzard-Low and<br/>Lewis Jones and has recently appointed Donald Bousted as Leverhulme composer<br/>in residence.</p><p>The aim of CNMI is to develop new versions of mainstream acoustic and<br/>orchestral instruments, with the immediate objective of creating<br/>orchestral-type instruments that reliably provide quartertones and other<br/>tuning systems. CNMI is also keen to encourage new timbral possibilities,<br/>acoustic-electronic hybrid instruments, and those that complement digital<br/>and electroacoustic instruments and music.</p><p>The application of new technologies to existing instruments suggests many<br/>new design possibilities. CNMI is prototyping wind instruments in which<br/>keys and valves are activated electromechanically. For example, a brass<br/>quintet is currently being remodelled by David Cowie to employ solenoid<br/>valve action. Each instrument of the new quintet will be constructed to<br/>realise 12-, 19-, and 24-division equal temperaments. A quartertone flute<br/>is also being made in collaboration with the manufacturer Trevor J. James &amp; Co.</p><p>The purpose of the symposium is to encourage composers, performers and<br/>instrument makers to become involved on the development of new instruments<br/>through the CNMI project. CNMI plans to announce a &apos;Call for Scores&apos; for<br/>CNMI instruments, for selection and performance in 2002. CNMI will seek to<br/>create similar opportunities for performers.<br/>The Performing Rights Society Foundation, Boosey &amp; Hawkes, Trevor J.<br/>James &amp; Co, and Paxman Ltd have recently generously supported CNMI projects.</p><p>Location: London Guildhall University (Room 100), 41 Commercial Road, London<br/>E1 1LA.</p><p>Nearest tube: Aldgate East<br/>Coffee and registration: 10.00 am<br/>Presentations and discussions: 10.30 - 13.00 and 14.00 - 17.30<br/>Admission:  10  (L&apos;s or Euros?) on arrival (students and concessions free)<br/>Pre-registration is not required, but notification of your interest would be<br/>appreciated.</p><p>For further information please contact<br/>Lewis Jones<br/>Centre for New Musical Instruments, London Guildhall University, 41<br/>Commercial Road, London E1 1LA<br/>Tel: 020 7320 1841<br/>Fax: 020 7320 1830<br/>Email: <a href="mailto:ljones@lgu.ac.uk">ljones@lgu.ac.uk</a><br/>Website: <a href="http://www.lgu.ac.uk/mit/cnmi">http://www.lgu.ac.uk/mit/cnmi</a></p></div>
