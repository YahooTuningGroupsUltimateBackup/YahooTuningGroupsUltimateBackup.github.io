Mark Lindley refers to the &quot;coupling&quot; of partials<br/>for the 5:4 as a feature of 1/4-comma contrasting with Zarlino&apos;s<br/>2/7-comma, where all the intervals have a gentle beating which can be very<br/>pleasant in some 16th-century textures.</p><p>In a very pragmatic discussion of organ tuning, for example, Arnold<br/>Schlick (1511) expresses the idea of the syntonic comma in vivid albeit<br/>nonmathematical terms: the fifths must be made to &quot;suffer&quot; in order that<br/>the thirds may not be &quot;altogether too high&quot; for a Renaissance style.<br/>This has a sound almost of John deLaubenfels and his &quot;pain.&quot;</p><p>The main point is that in historical meantones, the fifth is quite<br/>noticeably tempered; in a &quot;microtemperament&quot; such as Graham&apos;s 135-tET, the<br/>temperament is little if at all noticeable.</p><p>Of course, we can agree in distinguishing 0.27 cents from 5.38 cents while<br/>still leaving open the question of how much &quot;microtemperament&quot; borders on<br/>&quot;macrotemperament.&quot;</p><p>One possible rough border zone: might something like a 3-5 schisma (~1.95<br/>cents), or the amount by which the fifth is tempered in 12n-tET, serve as<br/>one example of a rather large &quot;microtemperament&quot; in a &quot;JI-like&quot; setting.<br/>For example, Helmholtz and Ellis seem to take the view that this is a<br/>rather small deviation from just, and actually implement a 1/8-schisma<br/>tuning (a 3-5 schisma, for a ~5:4 from eight fifths down) with some fifths<br/>tempered a full schisma narrow, or 16384:10935, virtually identical to<br/>12n-tET.</p><p>Here my purpose isn&apos;t to propose an exhaustive definition, only to give<br/>some examples and invite your comments on whether we are in general<br/>agreement that &quot;microtemperament&quot; means tuning intervals slightly _away_<br/>from just ratios (or the most beatless or &quot;locking-in&quot; ones, if you<br/>prefer), in order to make other consonances more accurate or to permit<br/>more such consonances, etc.</p><p>Most appreciatively,</p><p>Margo Schulter<br/><a href="mailto:mschulter@value.net">mschulter@value.net</a></p></div><h3><a id=23387 href="#23387">ðŸ”—</a>Dave Keenan &#x3C;D.KEENAN@UQ.NET.AU&#x3E;</h3><span>5/20/2001 8:15:22 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Margo,</p><p>I totally agree. My current thinking is that it can still be called a<br/>microtempereament if it has up to about a 2.7c error, provided that<br/>the error in ratios of 11 or higher primes is smaller than that.</p><p>So yes, 12-tET is microtempered at the 3-limit only. Meantone is not<br/>microtempered anywhere.</p></div>
