The case of the Dominant Seventh chord is tricky, &apos;cuz<br/>&gt; on the one hand, I&apos;m voting for smoothness (just intonation is smoother<br/>&gt; than equal temperament), but on the other hand I&apos;m voting for harshness<br/>&gt; (the chord is unresolved, consonance isn&apos;t really the main goal of the chord).<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; So maybe that&apos;s why everybody&apos;s got a different opinion about it.  It hard<br/>&gt; to make a chord smooth and not smooth at the same time.</p><p>I suspect that the tendency of the dominant seventh chord to &quot;resolve&quot; is<br/>more than a matter of dissonance. The more &quot;in tune&quot; (consonant) the tritone<br/>is (leading tone and chord seventh) in terms of its destination tonality,<br/>the more its &quot;magnetic property&quot; can be felt by the listener. Also, fine<br/>tuning of the tritone minimizes the 12-tET ambiguity of &quot;enharmonic<br/>equivalency.&quot;</p><p>Consider that even more dissonant chords (major-major seventh, for example)<br/>can be experienced with little or no need for resolution. The important<br/>difference, I think, is the functional influence of the well-tuned tritone.<br/>Certainly, this effect is cultural to a large degree, but I think it is also<br/>acoustic. The fact that there is only one functional tritone per key seems<br/>too good an opportunity for creating specific tonal direction to be ignored.<br/>In this sense, the &quot;tritone&quot; between scale steps 2 to flat 6 in the minor<br/>mode is not a functional tritone (unless, of course, its tuning is modified<br/>from subdominant function toward dominant function and &quot;leans toward&quot; the<br/>relative major key).</p><p>Jerry</p></div><h3><a id=7679 href="#7679">ðŸ”—</a>Paul H.

The &quot;tritone&quot; between scale steps 2 to flat 6 in the minor mode<br/>is used as a functional tritone in the dominant-function diminished seventh<br/>chord; the 2 resloves up a half step to b3 and the b6 resolves down a half<br/>step to 5.</p></div>
