The URL<br/>for downloads is the following (this will connect you to the main<br/>page - just click on the &quot;Files&quot; link you find on the left once the<br/>main page has loaded):</p><p><a href="http://groups.yahoo.com/group/16tone">http://groups.yahoo.com/group/16tone</a></p><p>Release notes and description:</p><p>VET-1 version 2.1 - freeware softsynth for Pluggo 3 Runtime<br/>(Mac)<br/>Release notes for version 2.1</p><p>Please note that all the patches developed for version 2.0.1 and<br/>saved from within your host sequencer environment are also<br/>compatible with version 2.1</p><p>Bug fixes:</p><p>- a bug that prevented the EDO selection slider from working<br/>correctly when using octave-transposed oscillators has been<br/>fixed.</p><p>New features:</p><p>- DMOS (Dynamic Morphing Oscillator Synthesis) allows for<br/>time-variable waveform shape morphing controlled by one<br/>additional LFO per morpher: this LFO will generate a<br/>continuously evolving series of morphing waveforms with<br/>smooth shape transitions in a fashion similar to vector<br/>synthesis, extending the timbral possibilities of the VET-1 with<br/>new oscillator dynamics;</p><p>- improved filter saturation stage: when the oscillator volume is<br/>kept at a sufficiently low level (this in order to avoid pre-filter<br/>clipping), higher saturation values will allow for a more &quot;natural&quot;<br/>overdrive effect obtained by means of waveshaping;</p><p>- 7 new presets.</p><p>Regards,<br/>VC</p></div>
