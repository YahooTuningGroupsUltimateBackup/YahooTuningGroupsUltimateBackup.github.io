I believe Groven&apos;s tuning the same as the 1/8-th Skhisma<br/>&gt; tuning discoverd by Helmholtz. See Ellis&apos;s appendices in &quot;On the<br/>&gt; Sensations of Tone.&quot;</p><p>right you are -- except that Helmholtz&apos;s version was 24 tones<br/>rather than Groven&apos;s 36.  from my webpage:</p><p><a href="http://groups.yahoo.com/group/monz/files/monzo/groven/groven.htm">http://groups.yahoo.com/group/monz/files/monzo/groven/groven.htm</a></p><p>&quot;Note that Helmholtz&apos;s schismatic temperament was a 24-note tuning<br/> which made use of two alternates for the 12 keys of the usual<br/> Halberstadt keyboard. Groven&apos;s tuning is simply an expansion of<br/> this, allowing one more alternate for each of the 12 keys.<br/> Helmholtz&apos;s Pythagorean chain was 3^(-16...+7), and so that subset<br/> of the information given here also describes Helmholtz&apos;s tuning.&quot;</p><p>Groven&apos;s 36-tone schismatic temperament, described as a tempered<br/>Pythagorean chain, is 3^(-19...+16).</p><p>but yes, the idea and the method of tempering is exactly the same.<br/>my suspicion is that Groven got the idea from Helmholtz&apos;s book<br/>and simply expanded on it.</p><p>&gt; One might also compare this tuning to Sabat-Garibaldi&apos;s 1/9-skhisma<br/>&gt; tuning which makes the 6/5 and 5/3 just rather than the 5/4 and 8/5. See<br/>&gt; S-B Dinarra web pages for details and the Dinarra itself, a guitar<br/>&gt; fretted to 53 tone of the 1/9 skhisma tuning.</p><p>i&apos;ve been meaning for some time to make a webpage about Sabat-Garibaldi&apos;s<br/>Dinarra tuning, and in fact almost did it right after i created<br/>the Groven page ... but i was tired of thinking about schismatic<br/>temperaments after all the work i put into that.   ;-)</p><p>PS -- John, i plan to create another Yahoo group for the rest<br/>of the Sonic Arts pages, including yours and Ivor&apos;s.</p><p>-monz<br/>&quot;all roads lead to n^0&quot;</p></div>
