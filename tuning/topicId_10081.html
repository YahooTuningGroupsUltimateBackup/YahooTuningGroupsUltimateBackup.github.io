Which one is best?</p><p>I&apos;m far from knowledgable on this subject, but I always seem to be the<br/>one who replies.</p><p>~~</p><p>One of my favorite synths right now is the Korg Triton w/MOSS card.  It<br/>happens to be microtunable, according to the Microtonal Synthesis index...</p><p><a href="http://home.att.net/~microtonal/">http://home.att.net/~microtonal/</a></p><p>...specifically, it lets you set up 16 different twelve-note scales, and<br/>assign each patch to one of them.  The old key-change trick: fill 12 of<br/>the tuning banks with the transpositions of a single 12-note scale, make<br/>12 copies of the same patch and assign each copy to a different tuning,<br/>then change patches to change keys.  This eats up a lot of patch memory,<br/>unfortunately, and multi-timbral performance is sketchy.</p><p>The Korg also allows you to set up one 128-note tuning that affects every<br/>patch.  Useful for stretched-octave tunings, or mapping, say, 19-tet to<br/>the keyboard.</p><p>~~</p><p>Perhaps the most flexible microtuning synth out there is the Kurzweil<br/>K2K series, with 255 global 12-tone tunings, and a function that lets<br/>you change tonics with MIDI input.  They also sound great.  The 2500+&apos;s<br/>are rather pricey, but the K2000VP can be had at a good price.</p><p>~~</p><p>The truely budget-minded can go for the wonderful Emu Proteus 2000, if<br/>they don&apos;t need a keyboard (the Proteus is rackmount-only).  For around<br/>$800, you can get a neato synth with 12 global 12-note tunings.  The Emu<br/>has a great advantage over the Korg, in that it allows tuning changes<br/>from MIDI.  If you have $3700, you can get a Korg keyboard, MOSS card,<br/>_and_ a Proteus rack, and have an awesome rig.</p><p>-Carl</p></div><h3><a id=10093 href="#10093">ðŸ”—</a>John Loffink &#x3C;microtonal@worldnet.att.net&#x3E;</h3><span>5/20/2000 9:37:27 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>I would recommend the E-Mu Proteus 2000 or Xtreme Lead-1 modules combined<br/>with an inexpensive MIDI keyboard.
