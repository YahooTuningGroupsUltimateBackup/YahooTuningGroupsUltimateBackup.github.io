Paul mentioned the keyboard was the same as<br/>&gt; pictured here: <a href="http://www.microtonal.co.uk/instrum.htm">http://www.microtonal.co.uk/instrum.htm</a><br/>&gt;</p><p>It is the exact same keyboard except that I don&apos;t rearrange mine for maximum neatness.  I just<br/>take all the right facing keys and place them to the right and all the left facing keys and<br/>place them to the left.  Soon as I get my webpage working again, I&apos;ll mention it in my<br/>.signature file and you can see my more crude layout.  I&apos;ll try my best to get that done by<br/>tonight.  Check by tonight.</p><p>&gt;<br/>&gt; I saw this one illustrated in a 1920s advertisement for a piano company!<br/>&gt; More<br/>&gt; intentionally, though, Sibyl Marcuse describes the same by Johann<br/>&gt; Rohleder in 1791, and continues that the design was used by several 19th<br/>&gt; century German piano makers; Owen Jorgensen presents it as the &quot;6 over<br/>&gt; 6&quot; keyboard.<br/>&gt;</p><p>I thought that I invented the symmetric design in 1994 or so.  Due to severe depression, in<br/>1996 I tried to give the design to keyboard magazine and musician magazine to print and archive<br/>in their publications.  Then I quietly went insane for 5 years.  When I woke up from the<br/>nightmare adventure in 1999, I found that the keybaord magazines didn&apos;t publish the symmetric<br/>design I sent them.  So in April of 2000, I set out to patent it before some keyboard<br/>manufacturer got their corporate hands on it and controlled the patent for the next 17+ years.<br/>I got the patent pending status.  Based on your info, that isn&apos;t necessary now.  Thank you very<br/>much for saving me from the patent process.</p><p>&gt;<br/>&gt; I found a reference to the Rapian Keyboard in one of Paul Vandervoort&apos;s<br/>&gt; patents (relating to Paul von Janko&apos;s keyboard), and managed to scrounge<br/>&gt; an issue of Keyboard Magazine with a short feature written by Bob Moog<br/>&gt; (p18. Keyboard, Sept. 1989). Kanpei Mutoh&apos;s 12-tone arrangement has 5<br/>&gt; tiers of<br/>&gt; tall, medium size button keys - like the symmetrical arrangements each<br/>&gt; tier plays a whole tone scale. Positions are marked on the fallboard. It<br/>&gt; looks to have reduced octave span, and part of its reason is natural<br/>&gt; finger placement.<br/>&gt;</p><p>You wouldn&apos;t happen to know of any acoustical piano makers who have constructed a piano with<br/>the symmetric design?  I can&apos;t get that from your above info.  If you ever have time, can you<br/>list your sources for you info so that I don&apos;t have to redo all your research?  IF you have<br/>time of course.  I&apos;m gonna do the research if you don&apos;t print the sources.</p><p>&gt;<br/>&gt; While on the subject, I emailed with an instrument builder in WA who is<br/>&gt; constructing a strung piano-like keyboard instrument which will allow<br/>&gt; for instantaneous retuning, along with vibrato and glissandi. Patent<br/>&gt; considerations kept him from describing it any further, but it sounds<br/>&gt; very exciting.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Clark<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; You do not need web access to participate.
