At first glance there are a lot of<br/>&gt;intervals between common JI/meantone intervals, but as we go further down,<br/>&gt;there are some interesting anamolies.  The first scale with disc. 40.01 is<br/>&gt;do re mi fa so in meantone, except the third is flat by 3 cents.  The minor<br/>&gt;version below it also has a flat major third.  Looks like the optimizer<br/>&gt;prefers a just minor to a either a just major third or a comprimize between<br/>&gt;the two in this scale, because this give the widest minor second.  From a<br/>&gt;musical standpoint that sounds like a bogous reason, and I think it<br/>&gt;partially vindicates John&apos;s observation about the seconds being<br/>&gt;overweighted as harmonic elements, although you can&apos;t solve that by leaving<br/>&gt;the seconds out of consideration.</p><p>Hmm . . . well, I wouldn&apos;t take 3 cents too seriously, so I would just call<br/>this &quot;pseudo-meantone&quot;, but I see your point. Again, the only &quot;musical<br/>standpoint&quot; that is addressed here is that of all intervals in the scale<br/>getting equal playing time. If you want to ask a different question, that&apos;s<br/>fine, and the answers will correspondingly be different. I happen to agree<br/>that in real music one wants to allow the dissonant intervals to be as<br/>dissonant as they care to be in order to make the consonant intervals more<br/>consonant. However, that presupposes a decision about _which_ intervals<br/>(i.e., which entries in the interval matrix) are dissonant and which aren&apos;t,<br/>a decision which might cause this search to leave out some interesting<br/>possibilities.</p><p>All your other comments are good ones too.</p><p>-Paul</p></div>
