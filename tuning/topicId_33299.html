One of my<br/>teachers and the personal &quot;mentor&quot; for our composers&apos; group was the<br/>electronic music pioneer Otto Luening, who was one of Busoni&apos;s<br/>students, so this discussion has a particular interest for me.</p><p>One would think that I should be on the side of the Busoni *entirely*<br/>in his controversy with Pfitzner.  Well, essentially, this is<br/>correct, but there is a somewhat humorous caveat:  I&apos;ve actually<br/>*liked* Pfitzner&apos;s music *better!*</p><p>Shameful as it may seem, I heard Busoni&apos;s _Dr. Faustus_ at the Met<br/>(paying practically $100 for a ticket) and was disappointed.  It<br/>seemed there were few *real* musical ideas in it... lots of motion,<br/>but nothing that stayed in the *EAR.*</p><p>And, even more unfortunately, :) I heard the _Palestrina_ of Pfitzner<br/>a couple of years earlier also in Lincoln Center, and found it<br/>*quite* engaging, even though in a very &quot;conservative&quot; mode.</p><p>I guess this indicates that there&apos;s more to *music* then the<br/>particular materials used or the attitude or even *polemics* of the<br/>composers.</p><p>Maybe composers should just, in general, *shut up* and stick to<br/>writing *music*.....   :)</p><p>Joseph Pehrson</p></div><h3><a id=33301 href="#33301">ðŸ”—</a>manuel.op.de.coul@eon-benelux.com</h3><span>1/28/2002 9:04:21 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>I like some of Busoni&apos;s works, but find his piano<br/>concerto uninteresting. I never heard Pfitzner&apos;s music.</p><p>Brahms was very conservative too. Yet he was Xenakis&apos;<br/>favourite composer, who was all but conservative!</p><p>Manuel</p></div>
