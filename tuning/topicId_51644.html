Calculating a chain of two fifths intervals by a frequency<br/>  ratio of 3/2, beginning with a &quot;C&quot; and ending with a D<br/>  and on the other hand calculating a sub-fifth &quot;F&quot; to<br/>  this start C by 2/3 and a sub-minor-third &quot;D&quot; with 5/6 to this F -<br/>  and then setting both D into the same octave position.<br/>  The result of the first calculation is 9/8, (3/2 * 3/2 *1/2)<br/>  The result of the second one is 10/9, (2/3*5/6*2)<br/>  (the syntonic comma).</p><p>  3. The difference between a chain of three major<br/>  thirds, tuned 5/4 against the octave, tuned  2/1<br/>  (the little diesis)</p><p>  and so on.</p><p>  Werner</p></div><h3><a id=51661 href="#51661">ðŸ”—</a>wallyesterpaulrus &#x3C;paul@stretch-music.com&#x3E;</h3><span>1/12/2004 11:28:25 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;Haresh BAKSHI&quot; &lt;hareshbakshi@h...&gt;<br/>wrote:</p><p>&gt; Hello ALL, I understand that all commas are intervals, but all<br/>&gt;intervals are NOT commas.</p><p>Not all intervals are commas. Normally, only JI intervals (and only<br/>relatively small ones at that) can even *qualify* as commas. However,<br/>said JI interval, once it&apos;s identified as a comma, may then be<br/>tempered out -- in fact this is sometimes used as the definition of<br/>comma, in which case all commas are actually the same interval: 0<br/>cents. More typical, though, is to allow it to *not* be tempered out<br/>as well. Then we can also have the case where some *other* comma is<br/>being tempered out, which can cause the original comma to depart from<br/>its JI in magnitude and even direction.</p><p>It gets worse -- in JI, commas are categorized under different names,<br/>depending on size or other, sometimes obscure (e.g. accident of<br/>history), considerations. These names include diesis, kleisma,<br/>and . . . comma. Clearly a definitional nightmare.</p><p>To attempt to answer your question, . . . If we are strictly talking<br/>about JI, I might consider any JI interval as small as, say 9:8 or<br/>smaller as a potential comma for delimiting a periodicity block --<br/>the larger end of the range here, though, would only be relevant for<br/>pentatonic scales and the like, while for defining large JI scales,<br/>only the smaller part of this range would be sensible to look at. If,<br/>on the other hand, we are talking about tempering JI intervals out,<br/>then I would set a maximum on induced error; so for a ratio in lowest<br/>terms n/d, I would require</p><p>log(n/d)/log(n*d) &lt; .006</p><p>for example.</p><p>But then again you may not have been talking about periodicity blocks<br/>or tempering . . .</p><p>Sorry this subject is so lexicographically challenged :)</p></div><h3><a id=51662 href="#51662">ðŸ”—</a>wallyesterpaulrus &#x3C;paul@stretch-music.com&#x3E;</h3><span>1/12/2004 11:37:23 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;Werner Mohrlok&quot; &lt;wmohrlok@h...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;   -----Urspr&uuml;ngliche Nachricht-----<br/>&gt;   Von: Gene Ward Smith [<a href="mailto:gwsmith@s">mailto:gwsmith@s</a>...]<br/>&gt;   Gesendet: Montag, 12.
