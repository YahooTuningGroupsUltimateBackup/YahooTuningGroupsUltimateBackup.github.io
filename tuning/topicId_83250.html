(just kidding)</p><p>Yes, I&apos;ve been working on a very large symphonic work, parts of it being in 72-et. Like Tony, I settled on 72 partly for convenience, it being a multiple of 12. It does indeed work better than 53 for the primes 7 and 11, and though 53 approximates 13 more precisely, 72 does fine with it, and I sometimes use 13/10 (c. 454.21 cents) as a diminished fourth, for example.</p><p>Both 53 and 72 are kleismic temperaments, and I&apos;m using a modified octatonic of six pairs of alternating steps of 12 and 7 in 72-et and 9 and 5 in 53. The period is the perfect twelfth, the &quot;tritave&quot; of Bohlen-Pierce, but with twelve non-equal steps instead of thirteen equal.
