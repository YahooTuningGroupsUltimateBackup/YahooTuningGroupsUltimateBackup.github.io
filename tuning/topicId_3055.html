I&apos;m not sure I understand all the formulas so could you<br/>explain them. with examples just to make sure I get it. The principle<br/>towards &quot;means&quot; has as strong a historical precedence. I feel it is as<br/>important as Limits in the &quot;organic&quot; development of  tunings. I love your<br/>conceptual remarks as a contrast to my own rather conservative steps toward<br/>development towards new materials. As far as multidimensional lattices the<br/>Eikosany is a six dimensional figure that would look like a donut from 12<br/>angles (according to Wilson) It is possible to take his centered pentad<br/>lattice of the big E and rotate the factors into 72 figures. Another 72<br/>would just be the mirror. The hebdomekontany<br/>would occur in who know how many dimensions off hand and could possibly be<br/>enough of a life work to take it all in!<br/>-- Kraig Grady<br/>North American Embassy of Anaphoria Island<br/><a href="http://www.anaphoria.com">www.anaphoria.com</a></p></div><h3><a id=3085 href="#3085">ðŸ”—</a>rtomes@xxxxx.xxx.xxxxxxxxxxxxx)</h3><span>5/16/1999 8:01:38 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>[Sarn Richard Ursell TD 183.7]</p><p>&gt;Suppose I layer down a matrix, in 2D, and, likeso:<br/>...

My next reaction is to say<br/>that and two notes X and Y will produces beats at (Y-X) and (X+Y) but<br/>the minus one is generally far more important than the plus one.<br/>I think that your table wouldbe much more interesting if you tabulate<br/>the beats between the notes (i.e (Y-X) in each cell) rather than the<br/>average.  Do it once for JI and once for ET and the results will tell a<br/>big story - in JI nearly all the beats are notes in the key (or at least<br/>harmonic with them) while in ET they are not.</p><p>-- Ray Tomes -- <a href="http://www.kcbbs.gen.nz/users/rtomes/rt-home.htm">http://www.kcbbs.gen.nz/users/rtomes/rt-home.htm</a> --<br/>   Cycles email list -- <a href="http://www.kcbbs.gen.nz/users/af/cyc.htm">http://www.kcbbs.gen.nz/users/af/cyc.htm</a><br/>Alexandria eGroup list -- <a href="http://www.kcbbs.gen.nz/users/af/alex.htm">http://www.kcbbs.gen.nz/users/af/alex.htm</a><br/>Boundaries of Science <a href="http://www.kcbbs.gen.nz/users/af/scienceb.htm">http://www.kcbbs.gen.nz/users/af/scienceb.htm</a></p></div>
