For me, European medieval and Renaissance music has<br/>been my main &quot;Top 40&quot; for well over 30 years -- or just about 35<br/>years, since it was the fall of 1966 that a high school course in<br/>music appreciation, actually European music history, made me fall in<br/>love first with the 16th century, then with medieval styles.</p><p>Thus a 14th-century cadence for me is like &quot;V7-I&quot; for someone trained<br/>mainly in the 18th-19th century European tradition. Maybe it&apos;s human<br/>to look for new angles on the familiar, intonational or otherwise.</p><p>However, I want strongly to affirm that _really_ &quot;straight&quot; medieval<br/>performances, or performances along historical lines as best as we can<br/>discern them, are still an emerging art, and a most precious one.</p><p>About 30 years ago, for example, one musicologist wrote that he had<br/>not heard ensembles performing medieval repertory in Pythagorean,<br/>because they didn&apos;t want to be considered &quot;out of tune&quot;!</p><p>Over the last decade or a bit more, Pythagorean intonation for<br/>13th-14th century repertory, _and_ meantone or some kind of<br/>approximate 5-limit JI for the Renaissance, have been gaining in<br/>appreciation; but it&apos;s still an ongoing process.</p><p>There&apos;s still that tantalizing, question, also: in a &quot;straight&quot; view,<br/>what kind of &quot;microintervals&quot; might have been used in Italian<br/>14th-century polyphony? One historical ensemble, Mala Punica, is known<br/>for its use of these intervals, and one could cite an historical basis<br/>for at least _considering_ such practices from Marchettus of Padua in<br/>the early 14th century to Johannes Ciconia around its end, who remarks<br/>that there are concepts such as thirdtones or quartertones.</p><p>We could also consider possible cross-cultural influences, for example<br/>from Near Eastern tuning systems; certainly many of the instruments<br/>came via that route, and some 14th-century Italian instrumental pieces<br/>suggest such influences. A place like Cyprus around 1400, where the<br/>French court produced some complex polyphony typical of this<br/>&quot;Manneristic&quot; epoch, might raise open intonational questions.</p><p>For me, there is something of a distinction between performing<br/>historical music of this era, and composing or improvising new music<br/>in similar styles.</p><p>For the historical repertory, if I do something clearly<br/>&quot;nonhistorical,&quot; I want to give a disclaimer, so that people can<br/>appreciate at least arguably &quot;authentic&quot; period practice and also my<br/>likely deviations from it. Each has its place.</p><p>For my own music, I feel to take whatever direction seems best, for<br/>example using regular temperaments with fifths wider than pure, or<br/>using tunings like 20-tET or 13-tET not exactly either historical, or<br/>&quot;conventional&quot; even by _neo_-Gothic standards.</p><p>My concern is that people not assume that 20-tET is a &quot;medieval&quot;<br/>tuning system, or that something like 24-note Pythagorean or a similar<br/>tuning with the two 12-note chains a 64:63 apart is representative of<br/>14th-century practice.</p><p>There is a somewhat unclear line here: how about using a<br/>Pythagorean-based tuning system with pure ratios of 2-3-7-9 to<br/>_simulate_ on keyboard what flexible intonation just _might_ have been<br/>like in some epochs and places during the 14th century?</p><p>The hypothesis of mostly Pythagorean-like intonation, but with some<br/>cadential sixth sonorities tuned around 7:9:12 (around 0-435-933<br/>cents), _could_ approximate what some 14th-century ensemble somewhere<br/>may have done. WIthout tapes or CD&apos;s from that era, it&apos;s a more or<br/>less educated guess, likely influenced in part by how much one likes a<br/>7:9:12 sonority.</p><p>Of course, liking 7:9:12 has its own intonational politics, so to<br/>speak. It&apos;s a kind of declaration, or fashion statement, that there&apos;s<br/>more ways than one to &quot;optimize the thirds&quot; from a &quot;small-integer JI&quot;<br/>perspective, and also maybe implies that one loves the kind of cadence<br/>that this sonority often implies in a 14th-century setting.</p><p>At some point, however, we get outside of &quot;historically plausible<br/>practice,&quot; and into new music based on traditional ingredients. The<br/>line may sometimes be hard to draw, but it&apos;s there.</p><p>I&apos;m enthusiastically in favor of creativity on both sides of the line,<br/>but I am concerned that intonationally and otherwise musically<br/>&quot;authentic&quot; performances of the historical repertory be available, and<br/>also that other things are identified as other things -- including the<br/>ones that I delight in coming up with.</p><p>Now for the definition of &quot;early music&quot; in the Western European<br/>tradition, and also a view of the justly famed adaptive tunings of<br/>John deLaubenfels.</p><p>In the early 14th century, _Ars Antiqua_ or the &quot;Old Art&quot; meant mainly<br/>the 13th century, and sometimes especially its later portion, in<br/>contrast to the modern _Ars Nova_ or &quot;New Art.&quot; That might be<br/>comparable today to defining &quot;Early Music&quot; as the Beatles, or maybe<br/>Bartok and Stravinsky.</p><p>In the mid-16th century, similarly, it would seem that &quot;older music&quot;<br/>might mean the Franco-Flemish style of the later 15th and early 16th<br/>century, for example Ockeghem or Josquin -- here I&apos;m considering<br/>someone like Zarlino, for whom Adrian Willaert was the &quot;modern&quot;<br/>model.</p><p>The Academy of Ancient Music in 18th-century England specialized in<br/>the 16th century, with great enthusiasm for composers such as Marenzio<br/>and Gesualdo. Let&apos;s call this about 150-200 years of distance in time.</p><p>When I was getting started in the late 1960&apos;s, &quot;Early Music&quot; might<br/>mean &quot;up through Bach,&quot; while &quot;really early&quot; suggested something like<br/>a modal/tonal distinction, putting us at least before the later 17th<br/>century.</p><p>Now, in some circles, &quot;Early Music&quot; seems to mean &quot;something other<br/>than &apos;business as usual,&apos;&quot; which I guess could mean anything from<br/>Beethoven done in an unequal well-temperament or the like, to an<br/>authentic early 20th-century performance of quartertone music on<br/>piano.</p><p>Anyway, as I was observing with medieval music, just what might be<br/>&quot;authentic&quot; for the 18th century might also be debated, especially if<br/>&quot;unconventional&quot; 18th-century views are admitted.</p><p>Thus Leonhard Euler&apos;s view that 4:5:6:7 is a desirable tuning of a<br/>dominant seventh chord, and one to which artificial instruments (by<br/>which I mean simply instruments other than human voices) might be<br/>adopted, could serve as an historical basis for your 7-limit<br/>interpretations, John.</p><p>This isn&apos;t to say that Euler in 1764 is presenting a prevalent,<br/>generally accepted, or commonly implemented opinion, only that he does<br/>take the dominant seventh chord as inviting a more &quot;consonant&quot; tuning,<br/>a tuning for which performers might strive.</p><p>There is a certain distinction, Joe, which I might also make: when the<br/>standard or orthodox &quot;historical&quot; interpretations are<br/>well-established, then some more unconventional readings are<br/>especially welcome, and here the chance may be minimal that people<br/>would confuse the new interpretation with the &quot;historically correct&quot;<br/>one.</p><p>When the historical range of documented or plausibly inferred period<br/>interpretations is less well-known, then getting out &quot;straight&quot;<br/>performances may take one top priority, along with &quot;unconventional&quot;<br/>interpretations which I&apos;d want to identify as in that category.</p><p>Here the music itself is &quot;new&quot; for many listeners, so the freshness of<br/>the &quot;authentic&quot; intonational colors (maybe over a certain range of<br/>interpretations) is indeed something to relish, as you rightly say.</p><p>This shouldn&apos;t inhibit new music in similar styles, which can also<br/>build interest in the original historical repertories; if I sought to<br/>delay doing any neo-Gothic music until the Gothic style itself were<br/>well-known, that might mean waiting quite awhile (despite the dramatic<br/>expansion of performances and recordings relative to 40 years ago).</p><p>Nor should it exclude new interpretations of the original repertories;<br/>but I must admit that in performing this music, I&apos;d want to have quite<br/>an emphasis on fairly &quot;straight&quot; Pythagorean interpretations before<br/>getting into a great deal of the more offbeat readings. Yes, I might<br/>use a cadential 7:9:12 sonority here and there, but would mainly want<br/>people to discover the beauty of the usual 64:81:108 version (a<br/>rounded 0-408-906 cents) with its &quot;classic&quot; medieval balance and<br/>excitement.</p><p>John, your situation is a bit different: the typical listener, I&apos;d<br/>guess, has often heard what you&apos;re doing in &quot;standard&quot;<br/>interpretations, so there&apos;s maximum opportunity for diversity with a<br/>minimum risk of confusion.</p><p>Of course, in some cases, your interpretations might be _closer_ to<br/>period practice than what people are used to in a setting where 12-tET<br/>is often taken as the historical default for music suggesting meantone<br/>or some unequal temperament.</p><p>One approach here might be to mix performances in fixed<br/>well-temperaments (the &quot;historically authentic&quot; side) with those in<br/>adaptive tunings of various kinds: a great educational project to let<br/>people hear period tunings _and_ new ones.</p><p>Thanks to both of your for sharing ideas, and music, inviting comments<br/>from many directions.</p><p>Most appreciatively,</p><p>Margo Schulter<br/><a href="mailto:mschulter@value.net">mschulter@value.net</a></p></div><h3>John A. deLaubenfels &#x3C;jdl@adaptune.com&#x3E;</h3><span>10/25/2001 3:50:40 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Thanks for this thoughtful post, Margo.  I very much agree that all<br/>interpretations of music should be carefully labeled.  When I joined<br/>this list in early 1999, after having been playing with real-time<br/>adaptive tuning for several years in isolation, I was stunned to find<br/>that 4:5:6:7 dominant 7th chords are, shall we say, controversial.  Of<br/>course, I didn&apos;t stop using them in my favorite treatments, but I hope<br/>it is clear they&apos;re my own, unhistorical, interpretations.</p><p>Even adaptive 5-limit tunings of keyboard works cannot be justified on<br/>a historical basis.</p><p>&gt;Thus Leonhard Euler&apos;s view that 4:5:6:7 is a desirable tuning of a<br/>&gt;dominant seventh chord, and one to which artificial instruments (by<br/>&gt;which I mean simply instruments other than human voices) might be<br/>&gt;adopted, could serve as an historical basis for your 7-limit<br/>&gt;interpretations, John.</p><p>&gt;This isn&apos;t to say that Euler in 1764 is presenting a prevalent,<br/>&gt;generally accepted, or commonly implemented opinion, only that he does<br/>&gt;take the dominant seventh chord as inviting a more &quot;consonant&quot; tuning,<br/>&gt;a tuning for which performers might strive.</p><p>If I had to pick one person as an ally, it might well be him; he&apos;s one<br/>of the real geniuses of history.  Still, even if he had spoken out<br/>vehemently _against_ 4:5:6:7, I&apos;d still do what I do.  Do you know if<br/>Euler ever got a chance to _hear_ the sounds he advocated?</p><p>&gt;John, your situation is a bit different: the typical listener, I&apos;d<br/>&gt;guess, has often heard what you&apos;re doing in &quot;standard&quot;<br/>&gt;interpretations, so there&apos;s maximum opportunity for diversity with a<br/>&gt;minimum risk of confusion.</p><p>I agree.  Of course it is still my responsibility to label carefully.</p><p>&gt;Of course, in some cases, your interpretations might be _closer_ to<br/>&gt;period practice than what people are used to in a setting where 12-tET<br/>&gt;is often taken as the historical default for music suggesting meantone<br/>&gt;or some unequal temperament.</p><p>Yes; for example, the keyboard and flute pieces by CPE Bach and JC Bach<br/>that Robert Walker put me onto, become adaptively tuned in a very<br/>meantone-like way, and might sound more &quot;normal&quot; to people of that time,<br/>than would the 12-tET performances that are more common today.  I would<br/>bet money on that assertion, if fact, if only it could be tested!</p><p>&gt;One approach here might be to mix performances in fixed<br/>&gt;well-temperaments (the &quot;historically authentic&quot; side) with those in<br/>&gt;adaptive tunings of various kinds: a great educational project to let<br/>&gt;people hear period tunings _and_ new ones.</p><p>Agreed.  When I make CD&apos;s of my treatments, I often include each work<br/>twice, once in 12-tET and once in some sort of adaptive tuning.<br/>Substituting well-temperament for 12-tET would certainly be an option.<br/>Or, when appropriate, fixed meantone vs. adaptive tuning.</p><p>Naturally I want to encourage you, Margo, to pursue the tuning<br/>variations, such as 7:9:12, that you have found to be interesting, if<br/>not completely historical.  As you rightly point out, the authentic and<br/>the new complement each other nicely.</p><p>So when is a CD of some of your work coming out? ;-)</p><p>JdL</p></div><h3>BobWendell@technet-inc.com</h3><span>10/25/2001 9:19:20 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Margo to John:<br/>&gt;Of course, in some cases, your interpretations might be _closer_ to<br/>&gt;period practice than what people are used to in a setting where 12-<br/>tET<br/>&gt;is often taken as the historical default for music suggesting<br/>meantone<br/>&gt;or some unequal temperament.</p><p>John:<br/>Yes; for example, the keyboard and flute pieces by CPE Bach and JC<br/>Bach<br/>that Robert Walker put me onto, become adaptively tuned in a very<br/>meantone-like way, and might sound more &quot;normal&quot; to people of that<br/>time,<br/>than would the 12-tET performances that are more common today.  I<br/>would<br/>bet money on that assertion, in fact, if only it could be tested!</p><p>Bob Wendell:<br/>As many in this list are probably already aware, I very much agree<br/>with this idea of a certain flexibility in what we consider<br/>&quot;authentic&quot; or &quot;historically informed&quot; performance. I much prefer the<br/>latter term, since there is implied in it a certain honesty and<br/>admission of less than complete certainty as to what &quot;authetic&quot; might<br/>actually be.</p><p>Taking the written evidence from a few great musicians of the times<br/>and deciding that it represents a &quot;gospel&quot; of the common practice of<br/>the day is something I wouldn&apos;t consider terribly reliable. We can<br/>take cues from it, but it seems to me we need to consider certain<br/>global features implicit in the evidence more seriously, rather than<br/>every &quot;jot and tittle&quot; of written text.</p><p>For example, why is it not perfectly valid to note that the tuning<br/>systems and writings about them after meantones began to dominate<br/>reflect a clear preoccupation with the purity of harmonic intervals?<br/>Just looking at the temperaments in themselves is, in my view, a very<br/>narrow angle vision of what might have actually been going on.</p><p>As opposed to current commom practice, keyboard musicians tuned their<br/>own instruments frequently, often before every performance and even<br/>during performance when the music demanded a new key a fifth or so<br/>further in either direction from the playable keys of the moment.<br/>This indicates an important general characteristic of those musical<br/>cultures. They were continually exposed to finer, microtonal pitch<br/>discrepancies that common practice musicians of today never have to<br/>confront.</p><p>To me this indicates a cultural abundance of intonationally very<br/>sensitive, well-trained ears on a wide scale. This in turn would<br/>likely imply that flexibly pitched instrumentalists and singers also<br/>shared such senstivity. Once musically talented ears have been<br/>exposed to the joys of pure harmonic intervals (i.e., JI intervals),<br/>my experience indicates strongly that they tend to favor them<br/>intuitively.</p><p>This in turn might imply that adaptive JI was a norm among singers<br/>and other flexibly-pitched performers in these periods. I like to<br/>view meantone temperaments as adaptive JI &quot;frozen&quot; for keyboard use.<br/>To turn around and take writings from period musicians concerning<br/>their views on keyboard temperaments and apply that as the &quot;gospel<br/>according to nostro Signor Fetuccini&quot; or whomever regarding the<br/>common practice of the singers and instrumentalists of the day is, I<br/>think, at the very least myopic and at worst totally &quot;bass-ackwards&quot;<br/>as we used to say in Tennessee.</p></div><h3>BobWendell@technet-inc.com</h3><span>10/25/2001 1:41:04 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>From:  mschulter &lt;MSCHULTER@V...&gt;<br/>Date:  Thu Oct 25, 2001  2:59 am<br/>Subject:  For Joe Pehrson and John deLaubenfels -- on history</p><p>Margo:<br/>There is a somewhat unclear line here: how about using a<br/>Pythagorean-based tuning system with pure ratios of 2-3-7-9 to<br/>_simulate_ on keyboard what flexible intonation just _might_ have been<br/>like in some epochs and places during the 14th century?</p><p>The hypothesis of mostly Pythagorean-like intonation, but with some<br/>cadential sixth sonorities tuned around 7:9:12 (around 0-435-933<br/>cents), _could_ approximate what some 14th-century ensemble somewhere<br/>may have done.

The<br/>line may sometimes be hard to draw, but it&apos;s there.</p><p>Bob Wendell:<br/>I like the idea of experimenting with possibilities, hypotheses about<br/>possible intonational scenarios in the flexibly-pitched world of<br/>music. Two stories (real, though) come to mind.</p><p>One is that some ancient instruments no longer exist even as relics,<br/>so they have been recreated from drawings, written descriptions,<br/>statuary from medieval times, and current knowledge concerning how<br/>other, related stringed instruments were built and about the science<br/>of their acoustic functioning. Armed with this combination of<br/>informational sources, modern replicas were built that are at worst<br/>very close to authentic.</p><p>But no one knew exactly how they were played. Some general sense of<br/>that was gained from surviving texts, drawings and statuary. The rest<br/>came from musicians experienced with related instruments using their<br/>natural musical instincts to figure out what worked musically within<br/>the context of what is known about period styles.</p><p>In a word, the instruments taught their players how to play them and<br/>very interesting instrumental capabilities came to light that no one<br/>had predicted would. However, there was a high degree of confidence<br/>that the ancient musicians who had once played them would have<br/>inevitably evolved the same techniques just from simple exposure over<br/>time to the instruments&apos; characeristics.</p><p>Another story comes from archeology and has only a metaphorical<br/>relationship to the first story. Some archeologists at the University<br/>of Pennsylvania had been studying for some time the highly successful<br/>agricultural techniques of the Incas and other South American<br/>indigenous populations. They had some rough ideas about some of the<br/>general features of this agriculture and some tools from their digs.</p><p>One of the professors had the idea of simply handing over modern<br/>replicas of the tools discovered to the modern descendants of their<br/>original users and turning them loose in a vague, general<br/>reproduction of the agricultural patterns they suspected might have<br/>existed and let them work it out from there.</p><p>What they discovered was amazing. Using these tools to sculpt the<br/>earth, a highly sophisticated method of agriculture evolved that was<br/>sustainable and used environmental factors with astounding efficiency<br/>to aid in crop production. The discoveries that came out of this<br/>included the use of natural algae that grew in between raised squares<br/>of planted earth to fertilize the crops. Multiple irrigation,<br/>fertilization, and harvesting problems were elegantly resolved with<br/>the method, which has become a model for agricultural methods in<br/>other appropriate geographical areas.</p><p>The point of saying all this is that there is more to understanding<br/>what &quot;authentic&quot; really is than reading what some few people wrote<br/>about it. Paper is flat and reality is multi-dimensional. Human<br/>awareness and its intuitive interactions with these dimensions is<br/>even more so. We artists especially should be able to understand this<br/>and apply it to our own domains.</p><p>I used these stories to make these points because I have advanced<br/>this argument before, but using less concrete means of communication<br/>with rather disappointlingly limited success. I wanted to take this<br/>opportunity to clarify earliers posts a bit. I hope I&apos;ve been at<br/>least mildly successful.</p></div><h3>Paul Erlich &#x3C;paul@stretch-music.com&#x3E;</h3><span>10/25/2001 3:00:52 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In tuning@y..., BobWendell@t... wrote:</p><p>&gt; I used these stories to make these points because I have advanced<br/>&gt; this argument before, but using less concrete means of<br/>communication<br/>&gt; with rather disappointlingly limited success.
