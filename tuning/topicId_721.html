That&apos;s why<br/>I asked you (and/or anyone else who&apos;d like to participate) to pick<br/>piece(s) for blind testing.  That offer is still open and will remain<br/>open as long as I am on this list.</p><p>I think that perhaps you have a misapprehension as to what sequences my<br/>program will process and which it won&apos;t.  It will process _any_ piece<br/>for which it is able to dynamically reassign MIDI channels without<br/>running out (this is necessary because I use pitch bends to effect<br/>tuning).  It is, if you will, not &quot;aware&quot; of whether a piece is diatonic<br/>or chromatic; it just does what it does regardless.  If you pick piano<br/>works, I can tune them.  Works with many instruments may be a problem,<br/>whether they are diatonic or chromatic.</p><p>It is not true that I asked my friends to pack the results, though if<br/>you believe that I did, I can&apos;t prove to the contrary.  It is also the<br/>case that I&apos;m not voting, but again I can&apos;t prove that.</p><p>And of course it is also the case that, even if the voting is 100%<br/>against my own preference, my preference will remain my preference.  I<br/>am content to stand alone, if necessary, though like all of us I would<br/>prefer to please others if possible.</p><p>JdL</p></div><h3>carl@...</h3><span>7/27/2001 12:56:07 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Brian&apos;s suggestion of double blind is good, Brian&apos;s suggestion<br/>of more than one sequence is good.  But the MIDI-to-text-to-MIDI<br/>will not work, owing to the size difference introduced by the<br/>retuning process.  John should make mp3s.</p><p>Note well, John, yet another person prefers the earlier versions<br/>of your software...</p><p><a href="http://groups.yahoo.com/group/crazy_music/message/713">http://groups.yahoo.com/group/crazy_music/message/713</a></p><p>...which is not to say that the new one should become unavailable,<br/>but that both should be available, at the choice of the user.</p><p>-Carl</p></div>
