(I<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt; hope I got that right.)<br/>&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt; I have tried to analyse this and can not see what your new tuning would be.<br/>&gt;&gt; Can you give a full set of ratios for your scale after modulation or tell<br/>&gt;&gt; me the<br/>&gt;&gt; new key note, please?</p><p>&gt;Yes, I gave the absolute minimum information there.</p><p>&gt;The scale before and after modulation are the same scale with the 16..30<br/>&gt;ratios shown above.  The 16 corresponds to the &quot;tonic&quot; and the tonic is<br/>&gt;shifted to a new position.  In this case the tonic is shifted one note down<br/>&gt;from C to B.  Lets measure frequencies in units contrived to make the<br/>&gt;frequency of C equal to 1 in the first chord.</p><p>&gt;Then the G-C-E 3:4:5 (or equally 12:16:20) chord is initially:</p><p>&gt;    3/4 : 1 : 5/4</p><p>&gt;and after the modulation the G-C-E chord is, because I specified that it<br/>&gt;have the ratios 11:15:19 and that the top note remain at constant pitch:</p><p>&gt;    (5/4)*(11/19) : (5/4)*(15/19) : 5/4</p><p>&gt;which makes the calculations explicit but can be simplified to</p><p>&gt;    55/76 : 75/76 : 5/4&#x9;&#x9;&#x9;</p><p>OK, I think I got it, but it looks to me like you have gone up<br/>to C# not down to B.</p><p>So you could achieve the re-tuning you require using the dynamic<br/>re-tuning of Midicode Synth and hitting a new key note of C#,<br/>in this particular example.</p><p>( But it took me half an hour with an Excel spread sheet to<br/>figure that out ! )</p><p>Interesting scale, I have an equivalent in Midicode Synth as<br/>Wendy Carlos Harmonic.</p><p>Peter<br/><a href="http://www.midicode.com">www.midicode.com</a></p></div><h3><a id=50011 href="#50011">ðŸ”—</a>Peter Frazer &#x3C;paf@easynet.co.uk&#x3E;</h3><span>12/16/2003 7:34:34 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>On Sun, 14 Dec 2003 07:30:13 +0100 Werner wrote</p><p>  &gt;<br/>&gt;So in this example the notes of your pivot chord do not move but other<br/>&gt;scale<br/> &gt; degrees are now tuned to the new tonic of G.</p><p>&gt;   But what are you doing at the following chord sequence in C major:<br/>&gt;  C-E-G, F-A-C, D-F-A, G-B-D-(F), C-E-G..</p><p>&gt;  At the point D-F-A the fifth D-A shows a &quot;Wolf&quot;.

The modulation bridge note<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt; (or &apos;pivot&apos;) need not be the tonic of the new key. So if you do not<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt; retune relative to the bridge note then you introduce an unwanted<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt; dissonance into the melody immediately following the pivot.<br/>&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt; For Just Intonation I think that the relation of the new key note to<br/>&gt;&gt; the bridge note would ( usually ) be such that dissonance does not<br/>&gt;&gt; occur.  Can you give me an example in which dissonance would<br/>&gt;&gt; occur, please?</p><p>&gt;The example scale you considered as a 12-tone &quot;Just Intonation&quot; scale is<br/>&gt;exactly the kind of scale that will minimize some problems, especially by<br/>&gt;making it possible to retain tunings of more notes when cycle-of-5th<br/>&gt;modulations are done.</p><p>&gt;However, what I have been recently interested in is using the harmonic<br/>&gt;scale:</p><p>&gt;    16:17:18:19:20:21:22:24:26:27:28:30</p><p>&gt;and doing things like modulating by major and minor thirds.  From XMW (with<br/>&gt;some conceptual modification) came the the idea that the current state of<br/>&gt;the tuning system includes a scale, a reference midi note #, and a reference<br/>&gt;pitch.</p><p>Yes, that is what I have in Midicode Synth for an individual tuning, also<br/>octave tuning in case you want to stretch or squash it.  Plus an overall<br/>note offset ( to provide transposition ) and a tuning adjust slider for<br/>overall pitch.</p><p>&gt;In my current way of doing things I think of a modulation as consisting of<br/>&gt;two aspects mathematically:</p><p>&gt;    adding an offset (positive or negative) to the reference midi note #</p><p>&gt;        this represents the movement of the tonic in MIDI note # space</p><p>&gt;    multiplying a reference pitch (frequency actually) by a ratio</p><p>&gt;        this represents the movement of the tonic in frequency space</p><p>That is what Midicode Synth dynamic re-tuning does.</p><p>&gt;(Personally I prefer to call this pitch but represent it in Hz.  Others<br/>&gt;object to that.)</p><p>&gt;Currently I am working with the assumption that all playing notes are<br/>&gt;retuned to the new scale.  XMW also allow the option that playing notes are<br/>&gt;not retuned, but retain their previous pitch.</p><p>This is an issue which Rick McGowan raised with me off-list.<br/>Based on Rick&apos;s suggestion the current version of my software<br/>provides an option for whether sounding notes are re-tuned or<br/>just subsequent notes.</p><p>&gt;Without returning,<br/>&gt;dissonances can occur.  But even with returning, if you are not careful what<br/>&gt;you are doing musically, dissonances can occur.  There are plenty of<br/>&gt;dissonant-sounding triads you can pull out of the harmonic scale above.  In<br/>&gt;fact the very example I gave for the resultant chord 11:15:19 might not<br/>&gt;sound that consonant.</p><p>It certainly doesn&apos;t sound that consonant to me!

I will consider providing<br/>&gt;&gt; programmatic access next time I update it but addressing by<br/>&gt;&gt; frequency rather than midi note number is probably too big a<br/>&gt;&gt; change.</p><p>&gt;There are also other problems with such a change in model.  Not necessarily<br/>&gt;problems, but possibly.  The MIDI note number also serves as a unique<br/>&gt;identifier for a playing note.  This is important for keyboard playing<br/>&gt;purposes (that is when an actual keyboard isused for input) when retuning<br/>&gt;can happen due to some protocol &quot;on the side&quot; which controls modulation.<br/>&gt;Playing notes may or may not be retuned dynamically during modulations.  In<br/>&gt;any case the frequency does not uniquely identify the playing note in this<br/>&gt;case, in a way that is helpful when keeping track of notes on and off.  For<br/>&gt;example if a modulation occurs and you don&apos;t keep track of the note number<br/>&gt;*somewhere*, you will be unable to turn off the note playing at the previous<br/>&gt;frequency.</p><p>&gt;In my current implementation of XMW I keep track of both note numbers and<br/>&gt;frequency.  Note numbers flow fairly transparently through the system and<br/>&gt;frequencies change rather dynamically.  But the note numbers keep everything<br/>&gt;from going awry.</p><p>&gt;-Kurt</p><p>Absolutely.  There are several structures in my software keyed by midi note<br/>number.  It is fundamental.

(I<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; hope I got that right.)<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt; I have tried to analyse this and can not see what your new tuning would be.<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt; Can you give a full set of ratios for your scale after modulation or tell<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt; me the<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt; new key note, please?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt; Yes, I gave the absolute minimum information there.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt; The scale before and after modulation are the same scale with the 16..30<br/>&gt;&gt; ratios shown above.  The 16 corresponds to the &quot;tonic&quot; and the tonic is<br/>&gt;&gt; shifted to a new position.  In this case the tonic is shifted one note down<br/>&gt;&gt; from C to B.  Lets measure frequencies in units contrived to make the<br/>&gt;&gt; frequency of C equal to 1 in the first chord.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt; Then the G-C-E 3:4:5 (or equally 12:16:20) chord is initially:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt; 3/4 : 1 : 5/4<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt; and after the modulation the G-C-E chord is, because I specified that it<br/>&gt;&gt; have the ratios 11:15:19 and that the top note remain at constant pitch:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt; (5/4)*(11/19) : (5/4)*(15/19) : 5/4<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt; which makes the calculations explicit but can be simplified to<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt; 55/76 : 75/76 : 5/4<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; OK, I think I got it, but it looks to me like you have gone up<br/>&gt; to C# not down to B.</p><p>Yes, pretty much, though I might rather say that I brought B up to C<br/>(because the 11:15:19 chord appeared at Gb-B-Eb prior to modulation).

That is,<br/>the pitch of C# would remain constant rather than the pitch of E remaining<br/>constant.  As a result none of the pitches in the G-C-E chord would remain<br/>constant.

The modulation bridge note<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; (or &apos;pivot&apos;) need not be the tonic of the new key. So if you do not<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; retune relative to the bridge note then you introduce an unwanted<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; dissonance into the melody immediately following the pivot.<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt; For Just Intonation I think that the relation of the new key note to<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt; the bridge note would ( usually ) be such that dissonance does not<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt; occur.  Can you give me an example in which dissonance would<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt; occur, please?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt; The example scale you considered as a 12-tone &quot;Just Intonation&quot; scale is<br/>&gt;&gt; exactly the kind of scale that will minimize some problems, especially by<br/>&gt;&gt; making it possible to retain tunings of more notes when cycle-of-5th<br/>&gt;&gt; modulations are done.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt; However, what I have been recently interested in is using the harmonic<br/>&gt;&gt; scale:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt; 16:17:18:19:20:21:22:24:26:27:28:30<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt; and doing things like modulating by major and minor thirds.  From XMW (with<br/>&gt;&gt; some conceptual modification) came the the idea that the current state of<br/>&gt;&gt; the tuning system includes a scale, a reference midi note #, and a reference<br/>&gt;&gt; pitch.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Yes, that is what I have in Midicode Synth for an individual tuning, also<br/>&gt; octave tuning in case you want to stretch or squash it.  Plus an overall<br/>&gt; note offset ( to provide transposition ) and a tuning adjust slider for<br/>&gt; overall pitch.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt; In my current way of doing things I think of a modulation as consisting of<br/>&gt;&gt; two aspects mathematically:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt; adding an offset (positive or negative) to the reference midi note #<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt; this represents the movement of the tonic in MIDI note # space<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt; multiplying a reference pitch (frequency actually) by a ratio<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt; this represents the movement of the tonic in frequency space<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; That is what Midicode Synth dynamic re-tuning does.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt; (Personally I prefer to call this pitch but represent it in Hz.  Others<br/>&gt;&gt; object to that.)<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt; Currently I am working with the assumption that all playing notes are<br/>&gt;&gt; retuned to the new scale.  XMW also allow the option that playing notes are<br/>&gt;&gt; not retuned, but retain their previous pitch.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; This is an issue which Rick McGowan raised with me off-list.<br/>&gt; Based on Rick&apos;s suggestion the current version of my software<br/>&gt; provides an option for whether sounding notes are re-tuned or<br/>&gt; just subsequent notes.</p><p>Yes, it also occurred to me that having an option to do the same for<br/>*octaves* of the sounding notes might be desirable, in case the player adds<br/>an octave.  Of course, you could take the same argument in many other<br/>directions.  It is a question of what protocols end up being useful.</p><p>-Kurt</p></div><h3><a id=50072 href="#50072">ðŸ”—</a>Kurt Bigler &#x3C;kkb@breathsense.com&#x3E;</h3><span>12/17/2003 6:30:30 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Peter, and Robert Walker also if you are reading, and Carl also,</p><p>on 12/16/03 1:54 AM, Peter Frazer &lt;<a href="mailto:paf@easynet.co.uk">paf@easynet.co.uk</a>&gt; wrote:</p><p>&gt; On Sat, 13 Dec 2003 21:37:24 -0000 Robert wrote<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt; I see that really you have two notes to set there<br/>&gt;&gt; - the bridge note and the new tonic.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt; So that is more of a challenge to the User Interface.<br/>&gt;&gt; I suppose you could do it by saying that<br/>&gt;&gt; the bridge note is to be the current note played<br/>&gt;&gt; in a melody line, or a best fit for the notes currently in play<br/>&gt;&gt; for a chord,and user just changes the tonic. Come to think<br/>&gt;&gt; of it that is probably what Peter is describing.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt; That sounds like a far more natural system<br/>&gt;&gt; to play with. User doesn&apos;t need to bother<br/>&gt;&gt; about the bridge notes, so the music always<br/>&gt;&gt; dovetails about at least one note, and just set the<br/>&gt;&gt; tonic to change to.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt; So if piece moves to a perceived new key,<br/>&gt;&gt; user can simply set the<br/>&gt;&gt; new tonic to that key.

At the moment it<br/>is very interesting to me to look for protocols that offer more retuning<br/>choices in the context of an instrument with 2-octave or greater organ<br/>pedalboard, beause this is what I have.  On a one octave pedalboard I could<br/>not differentiate upward movements from downward movements, for example.<br/>With 2.5 octaves that becomes a possibility, which remains useful in most<br/>circumstances given the always-available option to substitute octaves in<br/>advance of a modulation such that the desired upward/downward movement<br/>direction is available.</p><p>The current questions for me are how to make best use of:</p><p>    differentiating upward/downward movements on the pedalboard</p><p>    detection of overlapping versus non-overlapping depression of<br/>        consecutive pedals</p><p>    possible use of &quot;tapping&quot; (stacatto) pedal presses<br/>        (obviously such would rule out actual use of stacatto!)</p><p>    support for modes which impose other constraints or models<br/>        that are in keeping with a particularly compositional purposes<br/>        For example, one way to keep pitches from going astray<br/>        would be to map each modulation onto the shortest sequence<br/>        of circle-of-5th modulations required to get to that note.<br/>        This might work well for certain scales, within limits,<br/>        but I have not yet tried it.<br/>        Nonetheless it is an example of a model that could be imposed.</p><p>-Kurt</p><p>&gt;<br/>&gt; Peter<br/>&gt; <a href="http://www.midicode.com">www.midicode.com</a></p></div><h3><a id=50081 href="#50081">ðŸ”—</a>Werner Mohrlok &#x3C;wmohrlok@hermode.com&#x3E;</h3><span>12/18/2003 3:56:59 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>-----Urspr&iuml;&iquest;&half;ngliche Nachricht-----<br/>  Von: Kurt Bigler [<a href="mailto:kkb@breathsense.com">mailto:kkb@breathsense.com</a>]<br/>  Gesendet: Donnerstag, 18.
