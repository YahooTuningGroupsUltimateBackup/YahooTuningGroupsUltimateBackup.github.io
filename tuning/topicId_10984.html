Here, it is almost<br/>heartbreaking.  If I could tune it at one temperature then at least I could<br/>profit by experience.  But it takes seven days working about ten hours a day<br/>(this time--and I actually hurried), so even that is impossible.  Which<br/>reinforces the need either for an electronic tone or a reed made out of some<br/>alloy less susceptible to temperature changes than brass?  Are you beginning<br/>to see why I become so aggravated when anyone suggests that I devote my<br/>lifetime to the parthenogenetical dropping of strange musical instruments?&quot;</p><p>Elsewhere Partch describes the chromelodeon as &quot;unmusical&quot; and swears it off<br/>for future compositions.  Jon Szanto?</p><p>Johnny Reinhard</p></div><h3><a id=11001 href="#11001">ðŸ”—</a>Jonathan M. Szanto &#x3C;JSZANTO@ADNC.COM&#x3E;</h3><span>7/3/2000 11:47:07 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>{Johnny R. wrote...}</p><p>&gt;I will continue to put info up that has not been printed showing Partch&apos;s<br/>&gt;ambivalence with the chromelodeon.</p><p>What do you mean &quot;not been printed&quot;? Enclosure 3 has been out for about three years now, and your bringing that one sentence (which I read over 3 years ago) to light now only makes you a &quot;Johnny-come-(somewhat)-lately&quot;.  :-)  Not to mention the fact that well-grounded analysis and philosophical stances aren&apos;t based on a small selection of scattered comments. I, for one, am still eagerly awaiting a finalized, collated and cohesive presentation on your explorations into Ives microtonal intentions. I was not convinced previously, but I ascribed that mostly to the piece-meal manner in which individual statements were parsed. In this case, my jury is still out...</p><p>&gt;It appears that there are contradictions for Partch</p><p>This surely can&apos;t be a revelation (no pun intended) at this point, could it? He may be one of the very *most* contradictory (and complex) personalities I&apos;ve read about. Then there was working with him, and knowing him -- quite an experience.</p><p>&gt;Since the contrary material has not been properly presented, I plan to add &gt;any more examples of negative chromelodeon feelings by Partch.</p><p>This only serves to make your work appear completely biased. What would *really* be of value would be to catalog every single instance, in every writing, correspondence, and speaking engagement, where Partch mentioned the Chromelodeon -- and let people then form their own opinions. Someday, explain by what you mean by &quot;not properly presented&quot;; the fact is that it has only been in the last 3+ years that the bulk of Partch&apos;s writings, and writings about him, have really been opening up the dualities and complexities of his work and his life. It is not straight-forward, it is not perfect. It is, however, rather fascinating.</p><p>And, if the historical nature of Partch&apos;s correspondences on this topic were of that much interest, Lauriston Marshall&apos;s letters have been in the special collection at University of Illinois for years, available for scholarly study.</p><p>Not to mention that you seem to *want* to read &apos;electronics&apos; into the statements at each turn, but he states in your quote that _either_ an electronic tone _or_ a different substance for the reeds might have helped. I can&apos;t remember if Harry actually *did* switch the composition of the reeds at some juncture in his life or not. I&apos;ll try to find out.</p><p>&gt;The more I read &quot;Enclosure 3&quot; by Partch, the more human, and understandable<br/>&gt;Partch the pioneer becomes.  While I myself am an acoustic musician, it<br/>&gt;appears that Partch pioneered the concept of electronics, certainly<br/>&gt;amplification, for his music.</p><p>You need to do more reading, because &quot;pioneered the concept of electronics&quot; is a bit of a stretch. IMHO.</p><p>Today is hectic, but I&apos;ve got some other thoughts about most of this, using the Chromelodeon as a jumping off point. I really have to update the website first, and mail out a couple of t-shirts, etc.</p><p>Complex. Indeed...</p><p>Bye kids,<br/>Jon<br/>&grave;&apos;&grave;&apos;&grave;&apos;&grave;&apos;&grave;&apos;&grave;&apos;&grave;&apos;&grave;&apos;&grave;&apos;&grave;&apos;&grave;&apos;&grave;&apos;&grave;&apos;&grave;&apos;&grave;&apos;&grave;&apos;&grave;&apos;&grave;&apos;&grave;&apos;&grave;&apos;&grave;&apos;&grave;&apos;&grave;&apos;&grave;&apos;&grave;&apos;&grave;<br/>Real Life: Orchestral Percussionist<br/>Web Life: &quot;Corporeal Meadows&quot; - about Harry Partch<br/>                         <a href="http://www.corporeal.com/">http://www.corporeal.com/</a></p></div>
