I can&apos;t think of a single<br/>enharmonic modulation! (Though Bach&apos;s lute-playing contemporary,<br/>S.L.Weiss, did use them.)</p><p>Enharmonic equivalence comes in a few &apos;fantasias&apos; or preludes and<br/>fugues - most notoriously the G minor for organ, and the Chromatic<br/>Fantasia. But the whole WTC is indeed technically realizable in<br/>31-equal.

Bach&apos;s<br/>keyboard music, unusually, almost always keeps moving between<br/>harmonies, which may be a symptom of an ET-like tuning. So it might<br/>sound quite different in a non-circulating tuning with so-much-purer<br/>intervals.</p><p>~~~T~~~</p></div><h3><a id=68892 href="#68892">ðŸ”—</a>Gene Ward Smith &#x3C;genewardsmith@coolgoose.com&#x3E;</h3><span>1/11/2007 1:20:15 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;Aaron Krister Johnson&quot; &lt;aaron@...&gt;<br/>wrote:</p><p>&gt; What would you do in 31-equal with all those dimished 7th chords in<br/>&gt; Bach?
