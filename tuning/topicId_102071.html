Much of the discussion on this happened in<br/>the XA chat room and -NOT- on the board, so I&apos;m archiving it here for<br/>the record.</p><p>For the most part, the consensus was that while the intonation did<br/>change noticeably throughout, and while different intonations imparted<br/>their own unique colorations on the sound (sometimes heard as<br/>pleasant, sometimes unpleasant), there is at least some aspect of this<br/>piece that remained consistent for as long as the scalar structure<br/>remained intelligible, presumably the aspect that has to do with<br/>Rothenberg&apos;s &quot;rank order matrix&quot; concept.</p><p>A few people reported hearing the piece become less intelligible at<br/>the &quot;extremes,&quot; for example towards 5-EDO, where &quot;s&quot; became so small<br/>so as to be almost indistinguishable, or towards 7-EDO, where L-s<br/>became so small so as to be almost indistinguishable. Most people<br/>reported still hearing some semblance of diatonic intelligibility even<br/>in 7-EDO. A very small few (myself, John Moriarty, Pete K, Ryan<br/>Avella) reported hearing some sporadic semblance of diatonic<br/>intelligibility even in 5-EDO, sometimes reporting that this<br/>perception increased after listening to the other examples many times<br/>first.</p><p>There were a few people in XA chat, whom have always approached<br/>xenharmonic music from more of a scalar angle, that didn&apos;t understand<br/>what the point of this experiment was, or why it was supposed to be<br/>interesting that playing the diatonic scale in different tunings made<br/>it still sound like a diatonic scale. One interpretation of this<br/>objection is that these people didn&apos;t perceive the shifting ratios as<br/>particularly interesting as long as they were being used to intone the<br/>same scalar, tonal, and overall categorical structure Western<br/>listeners are most accustomed to. Others suggested that many of the<br/>more &quot;discordant&quot; intonations might sound quite palatable if they were<br/>being played over a piece of music &quot;intended&quot; to use those tunings by<br/>the composer. This suggested a followup experiment: to retune one of<br/>the fugues from the well-tempered clavier that would be played in a<br/>major key which tends to have wider thirds for most well-temperaments,<br/>and see if it sounds more &quot;natural&quot; in superpyth than meantone.</p><p>Many people seemed to interpret this experiment as a test to see which<br/>tuning people would like the most. The response on XA was a bit varied<br/>in terms of &quot;preferences&quot; - some people preferred around POTE meantone<br/>(Gene), a few preferred the sharper side of things a bit (me, Andrew),<br/>others said they liked tunings even flatter than POTE meantone (Keenan<br/>Pepper). Some said they really liked the really sharp 72-EDO one due<br/>to their being a bit more &quot;xen.&quot; Individuals seemed to vary in their<br/>tolerance to discordance of intonation, with Gene mostly hating it and<br/>others finding some of the more discordant mappings to be somewhat<br/>novel.</p><p>In general, the people who have spent more time playing around with JI<br/>tended to report a greater perceived shift between things like &quot;major&quot;<br/>and &quot;supermajor,&quot; and tended to be more sensitive to the intonation. I<br/>suggest that this may reflect the creation of additional (perhaps<br/>partial) discontinuities in portions of the interval spectrum which<br/>are categorized together for most western listeners. Andrew Heathwaite<br/>was the most vocal person in this group, but he also said that he<br/>heard the harmonic qualities of &quot;supermajor&quot; and &quot;major&quot; as being more<br/>similar than the harmonic qualities of &quot;major&quot; and &quot;minor,&quot; perhaps<br/>suggesting a graded categorization of musical intervals. This suggests<br/>that prototype theory may be a useful tool in modeling categorical<br/>perception: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prototype_theory">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prototype_theory</a></p><p>That&apos;s it for now.</p><p>-Mike</p></div>
