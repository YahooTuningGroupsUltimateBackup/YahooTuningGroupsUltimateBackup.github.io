(For<br/>&gt; instance, by a comma that would be tempered out if it were to be played in,<br/>&gt; say, 12edo.)</p><p>Hi Taylan.</p><p>I guess you mean where the note is spelled the same but would be tuned<br/>differently in pure tuning. I guess the answer is no, because the only thing<br/>that would imply a difference in tuning is the spelling of the note, and if a<br/>note is doubled harmonically, it has the same harmonic function; I mean,<br/>there wouldn&apos;t be a case where a double note is the fifth in one voice and<br/>the root in the other - same note will be the same part of the chord; hence<br/>the tuning will be the same.</p><p>Chromaticism in counterpoint is usually taught wrongly, or swept under the<br/>rug. The following might be all elementary for you; just some thoughts that<br/>come to mind ...</p><p>Another kind of example would involve notes that are enharmonic spellings,<br/>like a G-sharp in an upper part moving upwards and an A-flat in a lower<br/>part moving downwards, which would of course be tuned differently, but<br/>generally such an example goes against the traditions of Western practice<br/>for the very reason you have brought up, and composing that way isn&apos;t<br/>part of Bach style counterpoint.</p><p>With rare exception, when sharps and flats appear together harmonically<br/>in Bach they are part of a diminished seventh chord, or part of an<br/>augmented sixth chord, or a dominant minor ninth chord, or if they<br/>appear in succession they are usually chromatic upper and lower neighbor<br/>tones.</p><p>Usually opposite enharmonic inflections usually do not appear in the<br/>same measure, but sometimes they are close together. For example,<br/>in B-minor an A-sharp is expected, not a B-flat, but in the Bm<br/>prelude from WTC book 1 a B-flat in one measure is a diminished<br/>seventh of a C# diminished 7th chord, and two bars later an<br/>A-sharp appears as a leading tone to B as expected.</p><p>There are more rare chromatic passages in which opposite inflections<br/>of a letter may appear within the same measure, such as in the Art of<br/>Fugue Contrapunctus 4 where a D-sharp followed almost immediately<br/>by a D-flat in another voice, in the same register.</p><p>In my opinion, the Art of Fugue and A Musical Offering are the best<br/>scores to study to learn about Bach style chromaticism. There are really<br/>some passages of harrowing dissonance in the Art of Fugue.</p><p>Yours,<br/>Aaron Hunt<br/>H-Pi Instruments</p></div><h3><a id=72033 href="#72033">ðŸ”—</a>monz &#x3C;monz@tonalsoft.com&#x3E;</h3><span>6/24/2007 5:20:13 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Hi Taylan and Aaron (Hunt),</p><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;Aaron Andrew Hunt&quot; &lt;aahunt@...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; --- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, taylan &lt;taylan.susam@&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; Can anyone think of an example of two voices crossing<br/>&gt; &gt; at unison in counterpoint, where the tuning of the<br/>&gt; &gt; two pitches at unison is actually different, because<br/>&gt; &gt; of the relations implied by the (harmonic) context?<br/>&gt; &gt; (For instance, by a comma that would be tempered out<br/>&gt; &gt; if it were to be played in, say, 12edo.)<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Hi Taylan.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I guess you mean where the note is spelled the same but<br/>&gt; would be tuned differently in pure tuning.

This practice even happens in extended unison writing. It is common for example in the playing of the flute like instruments in Gagaku.
