Pork cutlets! Che gusto. I eat to your health,&quot; said<br/>his letter of Oct. 7.</p><p>Trichinosis was not even recognized until some 50 years later, Hirschmann<br/>said, and Mozart&apos;s treatment by two of the best doctors in Vienna was also<br/>less than ideal: bloodletting and cold compresses to quell his fever.</p><p>Hirschmann dissected previous theories about various illnesses or<br/>conspiracies thought to be behind the composer&apos;s untimely death in the<br/>report published Tuesday.</p><p>He offered evidence undermining the widely-known theory that court composer<br/>Salieri made a death bed confession that he poisoned his more-talented rival<br/>out of envy. Salieri told a pupil of his that the rumor he poisoned Mozart<br/>was &quot;absurd.&quot;</p><p>Hirschmann also discounted the possibility that Mozart accidentally<br/>overdosed on mercury often used to treat syphilis, because his symptoms did<br/>not fit.</p><p>Hirschmann also unmasks the anonymous patron who commissioned Mozart&apos;s last<br/>work, &quot;Requiem,&quot; who was supposedly sent by Salieri or some other villain to<br/>push him to exhaustion. The patron was Count Franz von Walsegg-Stuppach, an<br/>amateur composer who wanted to take credit for the work as a tribute to his<br/>deceased wife.</p><p>In any case, any theory about the cause of Mozart&apos;s death will almost<br/>certainly never be confirmed, Hirschmann wrote. Mozart&apos;s grave was dug up to<br/>make room for another corpse as was the custom at the time and his remains<br/>were scattered.</p><p>Reuters/Variety</p></div><h3><a id=25062 href="#25062">ðŸ”—</a>jpehrson@rcn.com</h3><span>6/13/2001 8:41:02 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In tuning@y..., &quot;Orphon Soul, Inc.&quot; &lt;tuning@o...&gt; wrote:</p><p><a href="/tuning/topicId_25057.html#25057">/tuning/topicId_25057.html#25057</a></p><p>&gt; I just got this article from an online news ticker.<br/>&gt; Thought some of you might be interested.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; - Marc<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Did pork cutlets kill Mozart?</p><p>This is nothing but sp--ham.....</p><p>______ ______ _______<br/>Joseph Pehrson</p></div><h3><a id=25084 href="#25084">ðŸ”—</a>George Zelenz &#x3C;ploo@mindspring.com&#x3E;</h3><span>6/13/2001 10:37:48 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Marc,</p><p>trichinosis is all over the &quot;Magic Flute&quot;.</p><p>GZ</p><p>&quot;Orphon Soul, Inc.&quot; wrote:</p><p>&gt; I just got this article from an online news ticker.<br/>&gt; Thought some of you might be interested.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; - Marc<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Did pork cutlets kill Mozart?<br/>&gt; Reuters<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Jun 13 2001 7:58PM<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; CHICAGO (Reuters) - The premature death at age 35 of composer Wolfgang<br/>&gt; Amadeus Mozart, who by one account was poisoned by envious rival Antonio<br/>&gt; Salieri, might have been a simple case of the genius eating a meal of bad<br/>&gt; pork cutlets.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; University of Washington researcher Jan Hirschmann, writing in the latest<br/>&gt; issue of Archives of Internal Medicine, suggested Mozart&apos;s reported<br/>&gt; symptoms, including fever and swollen limbs, fit those for trichinosis, a<br/>&gt; parasitic worm that invades the body&apos;s tissues through infected meat.</p></div><h3><a id=25120 href="#25120">ðŸ”—</a>Mats &#xFFFD;ljare &#x3C;oljare@hotmail.com&#x3E;</h3><span>6/14/2001 3:31:53 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>This serves as an example of the morbidity of obsession with old deceased composers... i bet they&apos;ll spend more time researching that than they have ever given to support anybody working with music today!
