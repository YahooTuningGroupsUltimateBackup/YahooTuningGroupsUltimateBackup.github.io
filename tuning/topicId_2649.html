Rich is a JI composer/performer who initiated<br/>the development of the Macintosh HyperCard tuning editor, Ji Calc.</p><p>Subject: Just Intonation music theory - music by Robert Rich</p><p>Sender: <a href="mailto:dxc@netcom14.netcom.com">dxc@netcom14.netcom.com</a></p><p>Music created with &quot;Just Intonation&quot; theory is perhaps,<br/>out of the norm. However, I found Robert Rich&apos;s works<br/>fascinating. In particular, I am fond of &quot;Geometry&quot; which<br/>uses Just Intonation and mathematical formulae.<br/>&quot;Interlocking Cirlces&quot; and &quot;Primes&quot; are my favourite pieces<br/>on Geometry.</p><p>Other solo and collaborative works utilising Just Intonation are:<br/>1. Numena<br/>2. Gaudi<br/>3. Rain Forest<br/>4. Strata<br/>5. Propagation<br/>6. Yearning<br/>7. Seven Veils<br/>8. Troubled Resting Place</p><p>If you cannot find Robert Rich&apos;s music locally, you may try<br/>the web site:   <a href="http://www.amoeba.com">http://www.amoeba.com</a>.<br/>The site contains CD cover art, reviews, sound samples, liner notes.</p><p>From a recent newsletter, I share with you the following:<br/>================</p><p>&gt; For those of you who are not already on Robert Rich&apos;s<br/>mailing list, here is an announcement he sent out a few days ago.</p><p>================<br/>News from Robert Rich<br/>  * Inner Landscapes reissue on Hypnos/Soundscape<br/>  * Credit Card processing at the Petri Dish (<a href="http://www.amoeba.com">http://www.amoeba.com</a>)<br/>  * Seven Veils and Below Zero<br/>  * Amoeba news: CD completed and a new label<br/>================<br/>* Inner Landscapes reissue on Hypnos/Soundscape</p><p>Inner Landscapes marks the first of a series of releases in cooperation<br/>with the excellent Hypnos label out of Portland, Oregon. Inner<br/>Landscapes<br/>is available now from our own websites ( <a href="http://www.amoeba.com">www.amoeba.com</a> &amp;<br/><a href="http://www.hypnos.com">www.hypnos.com</a>)<br/>and it will also have a limited retail distribution through Soleilmoon.<br/>Future releases in this series should include a 3-CD set of improvised<br/>live concerts from 1998, and more. Stay tuned for future announcements.</p><p>&gt;From the liner notes to Inner Landsapes:<br/>&quot;Inner Landscapes documents portions of a concert from 1985. This<br/>represents a growth period for me, when I wanted to perform shorter<br/>concerts that were completely improvised, while still maintaining the<br/>intensity of my all-night sleep concerts. Inner Landscapes is one of my<br/>few live recordings from this period that captures a bit of the thick<br/>atmosphere of the event.&quot;<br/>----------------<br/>* Credit Card ordering at the Petri Dish</p><p>You can now order CDs from <a href="http://www.amoeba.com">http://www.amoeba.com</a> using VISA or<br/>Mastercard.<br/>We have set this up as a secure transaction, so you can rest assured<br/>that<br/>your credit card number will be safe from prying eyes. Robert processes<br/>these orders himself, and he&apos;ll be happy to sign your CDs upon request.<br/>Along with all of the Robert Rich and Amoeba recordings in print, the<br/>Petri<br/>Dish is beginning to offer a selection of other items. The first of<br/>these<br/>is the outstanding photographic book by Brad Cole, &quot;The Last Dream,&quot; in<br/>a<br/>limited edition signed by the artist.<br/>----------------<br/>* Seven Veils and Below Zero</p><p>Thank you all for the overwhelmingly positive response for Robert&apos;s most<br/>recent solo release, &quot;Seven Veils&quot; (Hearts of Space HOS11086.)  Several<br/>people have said that it has become one of their favorite albums, and<br/>the<br/>reviews have been very generous. We appreciate the support, thanks!</p><p>Some of you may have had trouble finding a copy of last year&apos;s other new<br/>release, &quot;Below Zero&quot; (Side Effects DFX33). This one is quite a bit more<br/>abstract than &quot;Seven Veils&quot; and should appeal to fans of albums like<br/>&quot;Stalker&quot; and &quot;A Troubled Resting Place.&quot; If you can&apos;t find it in your<br/>local record store, you can always find it at the Petri Dish<br/>(<a href="http://www.amoeba.com">http://www.amoeba.com</a>)<br/>----------------<br/>* Amoeba news: new CD completed</p><p>After over a year of writing and recording, Amoeba has completed their<br/>new<br/>CD, tentatively titled &quot;Rust.&quot; Their second full-length CD finds them in<br/>a<br/>slightly more outgoing mood than on their first CD &quot;Watchful,&quot; perhaps<br/>even<br/>a bit accessible at times. Along with the new album, Amoeba is<br/>discussing<br/>the re-release of &quot;Watchful,&quot; on a larger label, which will be announced<br/>soon.</p><p>=====   end  =====</p></div>
