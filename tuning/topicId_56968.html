The cool thing is, he uses them very creatively, and along with what seems to be instruments in 12 eq...it&apos;s a great CD, and there&apos;s a sonata for flute, viola, and harp (sort of a Debussy tribute) that is absolutely beautiful.<br/>  And, I&apos;ve heard about string theory for years, but finally read a bit about it (Parallel Worlds, by Michio Kaku, a great book), and it looks like the Universe is a giant musical instrument, if this theory is correct. Not a big surprise, actually, but it&apos;s a hoot to see the physicists trying to prove it mathematically. Of course, how energy becomes matter is the real question, and one I&apos;m not sure can ever be answered in a scientific way. And, of course, if they are looking for a unified field sort of theory, which I believe is a big quest of science, they must include consciousness in their equations as well, as it&apos;s a part of the Universe too. It&apos;s fun stuff, but deeply important as well, and shows, again, that music is a very powerful mode of expression that has many meanings at the deepest levels of existance....which means artists should take what they do very seriously, and try to make the most profound and meaningful music possible...best...Hstick</p><p><a href="http://www.microstick.net">www.microstick.net</a></p></div>
