I side with the folks<br/>that say we need to be one community of tuning interests that is adult<br/>enough to accommodate all fancies and skill levels. If you can perform<br/>calculus, you can be civil; if you can shred on a (place favorite ax&apos;<br/>here), you can be civil.</p><p>Civility is *easy*, people.</p><p>It was way worse in days gone by, and these are the bumps in the road that<br/>make the freedom so worth the while. Keep calculating, keep composing, keep<br/>improvising -- just stop being ill-mannered. I don&apos;t want to have to call<br/>Johnny Cochran in here to settle things down...</p><p>*****</p><p>Apologies to the few that are on my email update list, but the following<br/>info would most likely be of import to a number of you here in tuning; I<br/>just sent this basic info out tonight to the Meadows list:</p><p>News: Newband concerts and info, online stuff, Picks back again.</p><p>Well, hello there. It has been a few weeks, but now there is much<br/>and many things to tell you of.</p><p>- Newband will be playing concerts on two coasts: New Jersey on<br/>  Sept. 12 and San Fran on Sept. 23.<br/>- They&apos;ve moved to Montclair State U. in NJ<br/>- Harry (and, by association, the Meadows) are featured in an on-<br/>  line zine that is part of a large astrology site (with many hits)<br/>- I&apos;ve revamped the Meadows guide to Partch media (cds, books,<br/>  videos) and done swell things like put images of the items, linked<br/>  to <a href="http://amazon.com">amazon.com</a> for your ease and (maybe) my pennies<br/>- Another update on the &quot;Delusion&quot;/Enclosure 6 upcoming release</p><p>Isn&apos;t that enough? When you have time, come and take a look: there<br/>are even hidden goodies, like the fact that you can hear, for the<br/>first time unless you were at the premiere, a preview of Dean Drum-<br/>mond&apos;s new piece &quot;Congressional Record&quot;. And in the next couple of<br/>days I have even more widgets to add (I needed to jam, since the<br/>astrology zine went live on the 4th).</p><p>Go look. And start booking your tickets and hotels in San Francisco<br/>for the 23rd of September (c&apos;mon -- 7 weeks is plenty of time to<br/>re-arrange your life). I&apos;ll be the one with the bow tie...</p><p>All of this, and more, is freely (relatively) available at</p><p><a href="http://www.corporeal.com/">http://www.corporeal.com/</a></p><p>where cross words are never spoken, unless I&apos;m up too late updating the<br/>site, when I get real pissed off with Bill Gates and ...</p><p>Never mind.</p><p>Cheers, all.<br/>Jon<br/>&grave;&apos;&grave;&apos;&grave;&apos;&grave;&apos;&grave;&apos;&grave;&apos;&grave;&apos;&grave;&apos;&grave;&apos;&grave;&apos;&grave;&apos;&grave;&apos;&grave;&apos;&grave;&apos;&grave;&apos;&grave;&apos;&grave;&apos;&grave;&apos;&grave;&apos;&grave;&apos;&grave;&apos;&grave;&apos;&grave;&apos;&grave;&apos;&grave;&apos;&grave;&apos;&grave;&apos;&grave;&apos;&grave;&apos;&grave;&apos;&grave;&apos;&grave;&apos;&grave;&apos;&grave;<br/>   Jonathan M.
