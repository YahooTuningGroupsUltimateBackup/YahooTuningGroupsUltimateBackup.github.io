Then you pick up<br/>&gt; a guitar and play a C13 chord, and compare it to 4-5-6-7-9-11-13 and<br/>&gt; say, &quot;well geee, thats not really it at all&quot;. I was dissappointed to<br/>&gt; see the book &apos;Lies my music teacher taught me&apos; making these sorts of<br/>&gt; claims.</p><p>This points out the wonderful variety of perspectives in the different<br/>kinds of analyses of tuning and other aspects of music.  Everyone<br/>hears differently, and so while there may be large areas of agreement<br/>among many people about the validity of certain theoretical ideas<br/>about tuning and music, ultimately everyone&apos;s perspective on this<br/>is uniquely his/her own.</p><p>Please indulge me, and allow me to recount a pleasant experience<br/>I had today ...</p><p>I had a rather light schedule today, and while I tuned a small<br/>Wurlitzer upright piano this morning in 12-EDO, and searched<br/>(by ear) for just the right amount of stretch, to even out the<br/>overtone-beating on the low strings, I spent a little while<br/>meditating on the sound of the harmonics of the &quot;C&quot; 2 8ves<br/>below middle-C.</p><p>This piano is in pretty good condition (altho I hadn&apos;t been<br/>tuned in many years), and as the sound of that string lingered<br/>on and on, it changed slightly, the lower harmonics softening<br/>as the higher harmonics gradually came into better focus.</p><p>[refer to mclaren&apos;s crazy_music post of a couple of days ago<br/>&lt; note the sloppy scholarship  :)  &gt;<br/>comparing perception of harmonic ideas while composing,<br/>to looking thru a telescope]</p><p>I could clearly hear a beautiful chord... reminiscent of<br/>some of La Monte Young&apos;s mellower pieces.  I&apos;d describe<br/>the chord like this:</p><p>~harmonic  72edo   8ve + cents</p><p>   14       Bb&lt;     3    967&amp;2/3<br/>   11       F^      3    550<br/>    7       Bb&lt;     2    967&amp;2/3<br/>    5       E-      2    383&amp;1/3<br/>    3       G       1    700<br/>    1       C       0      0</p><p>[Here&apos;s the Monzo 72-EDO notation legend:</p><p>symbol  72edo  cents</p><p>  ^      +3   50              A<br/>  &gt;      +2   33&amp;1/3          |<br/>  +      +1   16&amp;2/3   plus cents from 12-EDO<br/>          0    0<br/>  -      -1   16&amp;2/3   minus cents from 12-EDO<br/>  &lt;      -2   33&amp;1/3          |<br/>  v      -3   50              V                ]</p><p>Note that I&apos;m thinking (in my mind) in terms<br/>of two different theories, and also with a<br/>variation of the latter one:</p><p>1)<br/>the theory of prime-affect, in which the<br/>chord-identites each display a &quot;ness&quot; (in this<br/>case, &quot;2-ness, 3-ness, 5-ness, 7-ness, 11-ness&quot;),<br/>which is primarily a harmonic sensibility.</p><p>This is represented by the low-integer proportion.</p><p>2)<br/>the equally-divided-pitch-continuum theory, (which<br/>in this case is 72-EDO [= 12 x 6 equal divisions of<br/>the 8ve], or in another description, 72-ED2 [= 12 x 6<br/>equal divisions of the proportion &quot;2&quot;]), which is<br/>primarily a melodic sensibility.</p><p>This is represented by the 72-EDO adaptation of<br/>regular meantone-based 12-EDO notation, which<br/>in turn represents specific cents values [12 x 100 =<br/>1200-EDO, which is a finer division in the same genre<br/>of tuning].</p><p>All these ideas were turning around in my mind,<br/>as I listened to the 1-string chord resonate,<br/>and I tried to formulate a systematic way of<br/>comprehending in my mind what I was hearing.</p><p>It got me to thinking about Schoenberg&apos;s compostions<br/>and theories, for reasons which will unfold as I<br/>go along...</p><p>A big part of the reason why I value Schoenberg&apos;s theories<br/>so much, regardless of scientific experiments which invalidate<br/>them, is because his many of his descriptions resonate so<br/>strongly with my own perceptions.</p><p>I&apos;m speculating, but I really strongly suspect that<br/>Schoenberg got many of his harmonic ideas c. 1907-10<br/>from listening to low piano strings as I was doing<br/>today.  His _Harmonielehre_ makes references to the<br/>kinds of ideas I presented above, and...</p><p>On the Wurlitzer, the &quot;C&quot; another 8ve below that one<br/>bloomed an even richer sonic palette, which reminded<br/>me of Schoenberg&apos;s description (in _Harmonielehre_)<br/>of a sustained chord he used in _Erwartung_ which<br/>contains many &quot;dissonant&quot; notes, and, in part, compares<br/>it to the type of &quot;natural&quot; sound like the one I heard.</p><p>(Schoenberg also gives another type of analysis which<br/>resembles the theory of &quot;non-harmonic tones&quot; and their<br/>resolution.  Martin Vogel has done a JI-based analysis of<br/>this chord, which appeared in abbreviated form in English<br/>in _On the Relations of Tone_, and more fully in German<br/>in _Sch&iuml;&iquest;&half;nberg und die Folgen_, and I have done a more<br/>detailed and extensive one in my book _JustMusic_.)</p><p>Anyway, on this lower &quot;C&quot; I could eventually (actually<br/>after quite a long time) hear the 13th harmonic very<br/>clearly, while the 11th died away much faster.</p><p>Indeed, as I listened to this lower note I could not<br/>escape the memory of all manner of harmonic snippets<br/>from Schoenberg&apos;s compositions of this period, and<br/>especially that big chord from _Erwartung_, which<br/>Schoenberg notes is to be played softly, which really<br/>causes it to resemble the kinds of sounds with which<br/>the Wurlitzer massaged my ears this morning.</p><p>So in many ways I was thinking of a very wide variety<br/>of perspectives on tuning theory as I meditated on those<br/>gorgeous 1-note chords.  Brian has described Schoenberg&apos;s<br/>music as &quot;brutal&quot; and other such ugly epithets, and he&apos;s<br/>certainly not alone in that.  But Schoenberg&apos;s compositions<br/>do have sensously beautiful moments like this one in<br/>_Erwartung_ that are probably the ultimate in abstract<br/>music-making: simply playing around with sounds.</p><p>I view Schoenberg&apos;s theoretical work as a necessarily vague<br/>exploration of the approximations 12-EDO may make to a vast<br/>multitude of different systematic ways of comprehending<br/>a partitioning of the pitch-continuum.  I say necessarily,<br/>because Schoenberg realized that the breadth of these ideas<br/>exceeded not only his own limited mathematical understanding,<br/>but ultimately that of anyone&apos;s.</p><p>Which leads me back to my opening statement... and which<br/>hopefully will help to explain some of my admiration for<br/>Schoenberg&apos;s work.</p><p>love / peace / harmony ...</p><p>-monz<br/><a href="http://www.monz.org">http://www.monz.org</a><br/>&quot;All roads lead to n^0&quot;</p><p>_________________________________________________________<br/>Do You Yahoo!?<br/>Get your free @... address at <a href="http://mail.yahoo.com">http://mail.yahoo.com</a></p></div>
