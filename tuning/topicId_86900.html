I am really amazed&nbsp;by the beauty of the the way these JI/Pythagorean scales are used.</p><p>Still, I would love to get a simpler selection of traditional folk songs / chants /&nbsp;devotional songs&nbsp;/ children&apos;s songs in JI tuning, anything from Bulgarian folk songs to Ethiopian Chanting, to&nbsp;Celtic dance tunes but with&nbsp;traditional tunings&nbsp;. Would anyone know of a collection or even a few gems?</p><p>Thanks<br/>Steve</p></div>
