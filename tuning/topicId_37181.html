This is of course the desired<br/>outcome of such a paper.</p><p>I have never been a member of this list primarily because the topic (the &quot;tuning&quot;<br/>branch of microtonality) is not my area of interest, even though I have read<br/>entries here on a few occasions in the past (more so in the last week!). In addition,<br/>I am in general wary of this medium, in which e-mail-level dialogues with their<br/>casual, knee-jerk-reaction style (including occasional name-calling) are made<br/>public. (I seem to remember seeing Stuart Isacoff be cursed with profanities here,<br/>simply for advocating 12-note equal temperament. I myself was called a &quot;quack&quot;<br/>here by someone who has never had any contact with me, and who hadn&apos;t even<br/>read my paper or heard my music.) Also, I find it problematic that, for example, if<br/>I hadn&apos;t happened to visit the site, someone else (who also has almost certainly<br/>never seen my music or Maneri&apos;s, except for some relatively tiny excerpts in the<br/>PNM article) could have gotten away with absurd statements like &quot;Werntz&apos;s<br/>microtonalism is serial,&quot; and &quot;Maneri&apos;s microtonalism is tonal. Is definitely tonal.&quot;</p><p>However, I realize that there is no real substitute for this democratic type of<br/>forum, and now that my statements are being discussed with such intensity and<br/>inaccuracy I feel compelled to step in and write this letter, for anyone who is<br/>interested. In an ideal world this wouldn&apos;t be necessary, but since many of you,<br/>even those &quot;vocal&quot; ones with strong opinions on the topic, probably won&apos;t go and<br/>borrow a copy of PNM to read it for yourselves, I&apos;ll just try to clear up a few of the<br/>misunderstandings I care about most, here on your list. I do this because I don&apos;t<br/>want to be slandered, and I do want to encourage genuine, well-thought-out<br/>reactions to the actual points made in my well-thought-out paper.</p><p>I have been portrayed here as intolerant and insisting on one way - my way and<br/>Maneri&apos;s way - of microtonality. What I really do in my paper is to advocate a few<br/>specific things, for example microtonal equal temperaments in general, an &quot;atonal&quot;<br/>approach (even though I dislike that word), and something I call, for fun,<br/>&quot;atwelvetonality&quot; (a departure from the sound of the 12 equal-tempered intervals).<br/>I advocate these things  because of the artistic freedom they can offer to a<br/>composer. But advocating something isn&apos;t the same thing as being intolerant of all<br/>other things. Don&apos;t you all advocate what you do? I certainly hope so...</p><p>My paper was called polemical. The only place where I do get a bit polemical is in<br/>the &quot;Artistic Premise&quot; section (p168), in which I react against what are clearly<br/>polemical (and intolerant) statements about equal temperament and Western<br/>music of the 19th and 2Oth centuries by many prominent proponents of just<br/>intonation. In p166-167 I also point out that some of the JI arguments themselves<br/>seem implicitly  intolerant of all of the &quot;impurely&quot; tuned non-Western music of the<br/>world. (No knee-jerk! Read the article and you&apos;ll see what I actually say.) It is this<br/>intolerance of which I am intolerant.</p><p>I also make some straightforward and admittedly provocative practical and<br/>theoretical criticisms of the very basis of the pure-tuning approach to music. But<br/>again, disagreements and criticisms are not the same as intolerance. Should your<br/>theories not be challenged? I want mine challenged...</p><p>Furthermore, I am careful to make a distinction between the arguments made by<br/>some JI proponents and some of the beautiful music that certain of its<br/>practitioners have made. (See p170-171.) This was very important to me, because<br/>it is the music that is of greatest importance, ultimately.</p><p>To Margo Schulter: I am grateful that the tone of your letter was so civil,<br/>diplomatic and thoughtful. But the entire motivating force behind your letter<br/>seems to have come from a mistaken impression. You felt the need to address<br/>what was falsely conveyed through the tuning list as some sort of general<br/>intolerance on my part to a multiplicity of tunings or styles of microtonality. It&apos;s<br/>not your fault that list members have quoted me entirely out of context, and even<br/>have thoroughly skewed the meaning of my statements. On the other hand I don&apos;t<br/>understand why you chose to invest so much of your time in composing a response<br/>to something you haven&apos;t even read, when you even acknowledged yourself that<br/>perhaps you didn&apos;t have the facts straight. Perhaps you were too trusting of list<br/>members&apos; ethics. I truly would love to know any criticisms you may have of the<br/>paper itself, if you care actually to read it.</p><p>My motivation for writing the essay was to point out a never-discussed other way:<br/>how microtones may be accessed directly and applied to one&apos;s art, without the very<br/>heavy theoretical baggage that comes with pure tuning, if one is willing to engage<br/>in rigorous ear-training and to pay very close attention to what one is composing.</p><p>-Julia Werntz</p></div><h3><a id=37182 href="#37182">ðŸ”—</a>jpehrson2 &#x3C;jpehrson@rcn.com&#x3E;</h3><span>6/3/2002 1:28:01 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In tuning@y..., &quot;jwerntz2002&quot; &lt;juliawerntz@a...&gt; wrote:</p><p><a href="/tuning/topicId_37181.html#37181">/tuning/topicId_37181.html#37181</a></p><p>&gt; I  have been waiting for reactions to my essay on microtonality,<br/>and eagerly welcome comments, criticisms and discussion.

To say we should use equal temperaments is to adopt a rule, albeit a much less restrictive rule than saying we should use only 12 notes to the octave in an equal temperament. It gives us freedom only in comparison to that more restrictive rule, and gives us nothing by way of structure unless we bring something else to the discussion--as I, and many others, would bring in particular the approximation of ratios.</p><p>To say we must be atonal is simply a rule, and offers no more freedom than the rule which says we must be tonal.
