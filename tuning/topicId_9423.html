It consists of two intervals of one tone (Gk. _tonoi_,<br/>ranging in size from 10/9 to 8/7, possibly as wide as 7/6 (Aristoxenus)) and<br/>the interval which remains when two tones are subtracted from a perfect<br/>fourth, a semitone.  The 12-tet &quot;lie&quot; of modern music theory, if you will,<br/>is that a tone divides equally into two semitones. Of course there is no<br/>proportion in just intonation which will do that.</p><p>&lt;Both modes are dependent on the dominant seventh chord for participation in<br/>&lt;the major/minor system (as opposed to &quot;modal music&quot;)</p><p>One can find and compose for oneself perfectly acceptable tonal compositions<br/>in Major or minor without sevenths in the dominant chords.  American<br/>vernacular harmony may indeed differ on this point, but in parts of that<br/>repertoire sevenths sometimes function classically, as dissonances to be<br/>resolved, and sometimes as ordinary chord members without dissonance<br/>treatment.  However it is striking that one may also play a good deal of<br/>vernacular repertoire with all of the sevenths dropped (indeed, some of the<br/>earliest recorded examples of 12-bar blues consist only of simple major<br/>triads).</p><p>&lt;The business of &quot;three minor scales&quot; is basically nonsense that was<br/>invented<br/>&lt;by music educators who chose to &quot;teach&quot; melody before harmony. This<br/>&lt;prevented countless music students (many of whom are now teachers) from<br/>&lt;realizing that the reason for choosing flat 6 &amp; 7 or natural 6 &amp; 7 had<br/>&lt;nothing to do with going up or down, but rather with what harmony is<br/>&lt;prevailing. The dominant chord requires the leading tone while tonic and<br/>&lt;subdominant does not.</p><p>While I agree that music educators do turn a generalization about scalar<br/>forms into an unnecessary rule, teaching melody before harmony is certainly<br/>not to be criticized.  The idea of making a chorale harmonization without<br/>knowing the chorale melody inside and out, and without trying to make the<br/>individual lines as melodically attractive as possible is both unmusical and<br/>ahistorical. Classically, one mastered counterpoint before learning harmony,<br/>that is to say, figured bass; even in the chaconne form, with a fixed<br/>harmonic progression, the rules of contrapuntal voice leading had precedence<br/>over consistent restatements of the harmony. Your last statements are<br/>unsustainable -- melodies have generally preceded their harmonization.  (And<br/>before the common practice era, _ficta_ was determined on melodic criteria,<br/>often with remarkable harmonic results). Again, there may be exceptions to<br/>this in American vernacular practice, but you offer no qualification on this<br/>point.</p><p>Dr. Daniel Wolf<br/><a href="mailto:djwolf@snafu.de">djwolf@snafu.de</a> &lt;<a href="mailto:djwolf@snafu.de">mailto:djwolf@snafu.de</a>&gt;<br/><a href="http://home.snafu.de/djwolf/">http://home.snafu.de/djwolf/</a> &lt;<a href="http://home.snafu.de/djwolf/">http://home.snafu.de/djwolf/</a>&gt;<br/>  _____</p><p> &lt;<a href="http://click.egroups.com/1/1631/1/_/239029/_/954764286/">http://click.egroups.com/1/1631/1/_/239029/_/954764286/</a>&gt;<br/>  &lt;<a href="http://adimg.egroups.com/img/1631/1/_/239029/_/954764286/">http://adimg.egroups.com/img/1631/1/_/239029/_/954764286/</a>&gt;</p><p>  _____</p><p>You do not need web access to participate.
