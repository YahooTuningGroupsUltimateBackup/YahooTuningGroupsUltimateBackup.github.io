Thanks, Johnny<br/>&gt;<br/>The increment isn&apos;t exactly 6 cents though.  It&apos;s 5.865 cents, which is<br/>between 1/204 and 1/205 octave.  Like I&apos;ve said, 200 and 188 can *map* to<br/>Werckmeister well because of the derived Pythagorean comma being 4 notes<br/>wide.  But if you&apos;ve ever heard 200, the fifth gets a little tedious.  And<br/>188, being twice 94, can be a bit alienating.  In 212, you have the fifth<br/>from 53 and the 1/53 comma cut into four parts, since 212 = 53 * 4.</p><p>If you&apos;re using 1024 note per octave based equipment, you have the 1024<br/>fifth which lies between that of 306 and 359...

Given the size of the Pythagorean interval,<br/>I&apos;ll show you the deviations in rounded off cents.  Well actually since the<br/>deviations are 5.865, 11.73, 17.595 and 23.46, the progression would be 6,<br/>12, 18, 23 if I rounded them off; just so it looks consistent I&apos;ll leave it<br/>6, 12, 18, 24.</p><p>There are:</p><p>2 fifths (0, -6)<br/>3 major seconds (0, -6, -12)<br/>4 major sixths (0, -6, -12, -18)<br/>4 major thirds (0, -6, -12, -18)<br/>4 major sevenths (0, -6, -12, -18)<br/>5 tritones (0, -6, -12, -18, -24)<br/>4 minor seconds (0, +6, +12, +18)<br/>4 minor sixths (0, +6, +12, +18)<br/>4 minor thirds (0, +6, +12, +18)<br/>3 minor sevenths (0, +6, +12)<br/>2 fourths (0, +6)</p><p>...and there&apos;s your 39.</p><p>I&apos;ll admit occasionally filling in commutative blanks longhand produces<br/>unthought of results.

If you&apos;re asking, because of the threshold, if anything over<br/>240 won&apos;t matter, of course not.  Even though the actual chromatic notes<br/>smear, the geometries created by higher temperaments still create<br/>differences which aren&apos;t even really that subtle.</p><p>Anyone who was playing my early 1990s fretboards observed, that as long as<br/>you feel comfortable with playing in 20 or 30 notes per octave, that things<br/>pretty much feel the same up until the early 3 digits.</p><p>The big difference was between 217 and 323.  We didn&apos;t have any boards in<br/>between and we didn&apos;t have the facility to make them at the moment.</p><p>Playing the 217 board wasn&apos;t really much different than playing the 171,<br/>118, etc, in terms of feeling your way around.  But the 323 had this spooky<br/>way of just having that extra level of attention you needed.  Which was<br/>almost a Zen thing, as I mentioned which, my friend Ken tapped into and ran<br/>rings around it, very spaced out - so spaced out that he never remembered<br/>playing it.</p><p>After the consensus was in that there was a big difference there, we tried<br/>to narrow down, between 217 and 323 where this smearing would kick in.  We<br/>did some random tones and slides with sine waves and midi, and it seemed to<br/>be in the mid 240s.  The actual turning point we decided would never be<br/>significant.  Calling it 244 was a joke because we through experiments and<br/>from raw high temperament theory narrowed it down to &quot;from 240 to 248&quot;.  At<br/>240 it still sounds like notes, at 248 it doesn&apos;t.</p><p>But as far as what you asked, yeah, 224 and 270 I might have some notes on.<br/>I think we did some midi retuning to those.  Yeah actually a few times.  I<br/>only listed the ones I&apos;d worked with enough that I recalled them instantly.</p><p>Marc</p></div><h3><a id=34600 href="#34600">ðŸ”—</a>Afmmjr@aol.com</h3><span>2/21/2002 5:45:42 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Marc, it remains amazing to me--and many musicians I&apos;ve shared this info<br/>with--that there are exact increments of (slightly under) six cents between<br/>each interval available in a well-temperament.  Having played Werckmeister<br/>III (the &quot;chromatic&quot;) tuning a number of times, and having produced it in<br/>others, I never noticed.</p><p>It has been amazing enough to play Werckmeister in an ensemble.

This<br/>was not apparent through these experiences.</p><p>And so it seems that the 696 to 702 cents is likely the largest of the<br/>distances between 2 fifths.  Does this mean that the 5.865 cent increments<br/>available in Werckmeister are the largest increments?   It appears to me that<br/>there is greater distinction between intervals when they have a larger<br/>distance between them.</p><p>Thanks for the feedback.  Musician and musicologist friends threaten<br/>implications resulting from distributing information that Bach would use up<br/>to 39 intervals with only 12 notes.  One implication might be future analyses<br/>of Bach based on 39 interval usage (as opposed to key analysis).</p><p>Best, Johnny Reinhard</p></div><h3><a id=34601 href="#34601">ðŸ”—</a>manuel.op.de.coul@eon-benelux.com</h3><span>2/21/2002 6:16:00 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>&gt;Marc, it remains amazing to me--and many musicians I&apos;ve shared<br/>&gt;this info with--that there are exact increments of (slightly<br/>&gt;under) six cents between each interval available in a<br/>&gt;well-temperament.</p><p>Johnny, it is not very hard to understand why it is not<br/>amazing that this is the case with two sizes of fifth.<br/>For the sake of simplicity, let&apos;s take the semitone as<br/>generating interval instead of the fifth. This also visits<br/>all tones in the scale and we don&apos;t need to take wrapping<br/>around the octave into account.<br/>Say we have two semitones of X and X+C cents, for example<br/>96 and 96+6=102 cents.<br/>Then each interval consists of some number of semitones of<br/>size X and some of size X+C, say nX + m(X+C). Rewrite this<br/>into (n+m)X + mC. Then n+m is the interval class. Then<br/>you see that for a particular interval class n+m is constant<br/>and m=0,1,2,etc. which is 0x6, 1x6, 2x6, etc. cents,<br/>the difference between the interval sizes is a multiple of<br/>6 cents.</p><p>Manuel</p></div><h3><a id=34607 href="#34607">ðŸ”—</a>paulerlich &#x3C;paul@stretch-music.com&#x3E;</h3><span>2/21/2002 9:59:31 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In tuning@y..., Afmmjr@a... wrote:</p><p>&gt; And so it seems that the 696 to 702 cents is likely the largest of<br/>the<br/>&gt; distances between 2 fifths.</p><p>the largest of the distances . . . what do you mean? in Werckmeister<br/>III, these are the only two sizes of fifth . . .</p><p>&gt; Does this mean that the 5.865 cent increments<br/>&gt; available in Werckmeister are the largest increments?</p><p>they&apos;re the *smallest* differences between different intervals in<br/>Werckmeister III.</p><p>confused,<br/>paul</p></div><h3><a id=34614 href="#34614">ðŸ”—</a>Afmmjr@aol.com</h3><span>2/21/2002 11:56:00 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>&gt; And so it seems that the 696 to 702 cents is likely the largest of<br/>the<br/>&gt; distances between 2 fifths.</p><p>the largest of the distances . . . what do you mean? in Werckmeister<br/>III, these are the only two sizes of fifth . . .</p><p>Paul, what I mean is that the distance may be greater for this first well-temperament than it is for later published well-temperaments.  6 cents (rounded off)is likely the largest.  703 and 695 don&apos;t happen do they?</p><p>Johnny</p></div><h3><a id=34615 href="#34615">ðŸ”—</a>paulerlich &#x3C;paul@stretch-music.com&#x3E;</h3><span>2/21/2002 12:25:11 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In tuning@y..., Afmmjr@a... wrote:<br/>&gt; &gt; And so it seems that the 696 to 702 cents is likely the largest<br/>of<br/>&gt; the<br/>&gt; &gt; distances between 2 fifths.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; the largest of the distances . . . what do you mean? in<br/>Werckmeister<br/>&gt; III, these are the only two sizes of fifth . . .<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Paul, what I mean is that the distance may be greater for this<br/>&gt;first well-temperament than it is for later published well-<br/>&gt;temperaments.</p><p>oh, so that&apos;s what you meant!</p><p>&gt;6 cents (rounded off)is likely the largest.  703 and 695 don&apos;t<br/>&gt;happen do they?</p><p>the largest difference is probably in kirnberger ii, where d-a and a-<br/>e are each flattened by 1/2 pythagorean comma, which is 12 cents,<br/>which is the difference between the different sizes of fifth (and<br/>hence everything else) in kirnberger ii . . .</p></div>
