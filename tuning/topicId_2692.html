Nature has bigger things than even-vibration-ratios<br/>for man to learn how to use. Consonance is a relative thing (just a nice<br/>name for a nice habit). It is a natural enough part of music, but not the<br/>whole, or the only one. The simplest ratios, often called perfect<br/>consonances, have been used for so long and so constantly that not only<br/>music, but also musicians and audiences, have become more or less soft. If<br/>they hear anything but do-me-soh or a near cousin, they have to be carried<br/>out on a stretcher.&quot;</p></div><h3>Kraig Grady &#x3C;kraiggrady@xxxxxxxxx.xxxx&#x3E;</h3><span>5/6/1999 7:09:34 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>&quot;D.
