<a href="/tuning">back to list</a><h1>locking & high thirds</h1><h3>Gerald Eskelin &#x3C;stg3music@earthlink.net&#x3E;</h3><span>2/20/2000 5:14:22 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>I began preparing for this post by looking for recordings that illustrated<br/>the points I have been talking about here, but found little that was<br/>significant. I bought the barbershop album that was recommended here last<br/>month, but the tuning was not consistent. When I went back to albums that<br/>had previously caught my ear,  I found similar inconsistency. The one artist<br/>that exhibited the consistency I sought is the lady I have mentioned here<br/>occasionally, Sheila Chandra. I extracted a portion of one of her albums to<br/>share with you. The file is an mp3 and is fairly large (almost 3 megs), but<br/>I wanted to include sufficient repetitions of the motives to show her<br/>consistency and also to keep the recording quality high. The URL is<br/>&lt;<a href="http://home.earthlink.net/~stg3music/Sheila.mp3">http://home.earthlink.net/~stg3music/Sheila.mp3</a>&gt;</p><p>Note that the initial repeated pitch appears to be the &quot;low&quot; third (4:5?);<br/>however when the melody moves up to the fifth and then descends scalewise to<br/>the &quot;same&quot; pitch, her tuning appears to be the &quot;high third.&quot; I tested this<br/>with a keyboard that was in tune with the tonic drone by playing the<br/>keyboard&apos;s third immediately after each of these &quot;thirds.&quot; The first is<br/>below piano pitch and the second is above it. Try it yourself.</p><p>In the contrasting phrases that follow, the high third is heard in context<br/>with the deliciously low seventh (4:7?). (Incidentally, this interval<br/>beautifully illustrates &quot;my&quot; augmented fourth.) It appears that when Sheila<br/>approaches the third from above, she senses that it locks in at the high<br/>tuning and uses it there with consistency. When she begins a phrase with the<br/>third, she apparently opts for the JI third.</p><p>Lacking more examples from the &quot;literature,&quot; I decided to review some<br/>recordings where I _knew I could find examples--namely, mine. Looking back<br/>on the weeks of dialogue here, it seems that it might have been helpful to<br/>have posted these sounds at the beginning. However, at that point it would<br/>have been inappropriate to walk in with a pack of my own product under my<br/>arm, appearing to be pushing my own stuff. My feeling now is that most of<br/>you understand now that my goal was and is simply to learn more about what<br/>causes singers (and other musicians using flexible tuning) to tune the way<br/>they do. So begging your indulgence, here are a few LA Jazz Choir excerpts<br/>that I hope will clarify &quot;where I&apos;m coming from&quot; and why I&apos;m pursuing this<br/>quest.</p><p>While reviewing various tracks, I heard this vivid example of the high<br/>third. It&apos;s the ending of our recording of &quot;Blue In Green.&quot; The URL is<br/>&lt;<a href="http://home.earthlink.net/~stg3music/Blue.mp3">http://home.earthlink.net/~stg3music/Blue.mp3</a>&gt; and is just over 1 meg.<br/>Notice that the soloist, Vicky McClure, arrives at the last note and appears<br/>to tune it as a &quot;low third,&quot; but when the ensemble arrives with the final<br/>tonic chord, she moves it to the &quot;high third.&quot;</p><p>In the next illustration, you can hear the singers _moving slightly to<br/>improve the &quot;lock&quot; as these sustained chords are held. The URL is &lt;<br/><a href="http://home.earthlink.net/~stg3music/LoveIsAJoy.mp3">http://home.earthlink.net/~stg3music/LoveIsAJoy.mp3</a>&gt; Note that the pitches<br/>in these chords are nowhere near piano pitch. If they were, the end product<br/>could not possible lock as vividly as they do here. There is one chord in<br/>which I would have preferred that the sopranos raise the pitch slightly. Can<br/>you tell which chord it is?</p><p>Finally, this excerpt of the old standard &quot;Sweet Georgia Brown&quot; contains a<br/>lot of high thirds and low sevenths, most of them on-the-fly, but shows how<br/>extensive training in locked-in singing pays off in vocal blend. The URL is<br/>&lt;<a href="http://home.earthlink.net/~stg3music/Georgia.mp3">http://home.earthlink.net/~stg3music/Georgia.mp3</a>&gt; Note that the piano<br/>accompaniment has no adverse effect on the singers&apos; flexible tuning. (I ask<br/>my accompanists to avoid comping chords in favor of playing licks and<br/>fills.) Because the final vocal chord is sustained for some time, you can<br/>hear the baritones&apos; _internal &quot;high third&quot; as well as the tenors&apos; &quot;high&quot;<br/>major seventh. This may be of interest to some of you who wondered about<br/>these issues.</p><p>I hope these audio items are helpful in clarifying why I&apos;m here and what the<br/>focus of my questions are. I also hope you will give me the benefit of your<br/>responses.  (Of course you will. This is the Tuning LIst.)</p><p>Jerry</p></div><h3>Paul H.

It just sounds appropriately tuned. Actually,<br/>it&apos;s not a functional tritone so its &quot;tendency&quot; isn&apos;t relevant.</p><p>&gt; You sure didn&apos;t like that<br/>&gt; sort of thing in Monz&apos; I-IV-V7-I example with the V7 with high third and low<br/>&gt; seventh.</p><p>As you have said, context is everything. :-) Perhaps the difference is in<br/>_how high and _how low.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; But I&apos;m positive Chandra&apos;s seventh is _way_ higher than a 4:7. Try a<br/>&gt; keyboard comparison (your synthesizer&apos;s approximation of 969&#xFFFD; will suffice<br/>&gt; to prove my point), or perhaps someone can perform an analysis.</p><p>And I&apos;m positive Chandra&apos;s seventh is _way lower than 12-tET. It was the<br/>first thing I noticed when I first played it. Again, I haven&apos;t measured it.<br/>I assumed it to be a 4:7 because it sure wasn&apos;t a keyboard tuning.<br/>Furthermore, she tunes it that way consistently throughout the song. Also,<br/>it sounds exactly like the &quot;low&quot; seventh all through my Indian music<br/>recordings. Why would it not be a 4:7?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; (on &lt;<a href="http://home.earthlink.net/~stg3music/Blue.mp3">http://home.earthlink.net/~stg3music/Blue.mp3</a>&gt;)<br/>&gt;&gt;Notice that the soloist, Vicky McClure, arrives at the last note and<br/>&gt; appears<br/>&gt;&gt;to tune it as a &quot;low third,&quot; but when the ensemble arrives with the final<br/>&gt;&gt;tonic chord, she moves it to the &quot;high third.&quot;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I don&apos;t hear this at all and in fact the last note appears to be a major<br/>&gt; seventh, not a third, over the tonic (maybe I&apos;m hearing a phantom root).<br/>&gt;<br/>Listen again, Paul. Her last note is a third, both in the context of the<br/>song as a whole and within the final tonic chord. Sing along with her and<br/>you&apos;ll hear (and feel) her pitch change just as the tonic chord arrives.</p><p>Jerry</p></div>
