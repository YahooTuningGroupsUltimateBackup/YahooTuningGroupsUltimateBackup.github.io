The just passages<br/>have a sound and impact which to my knowledge, you just can&apos;t<br/>get using 12-eqt.  That being the case, 12-eqt is limited and<br/>doesn&apos;t cover the whole of the possibilities for effect of which<br/>harmony is capable.</p><p>    But there are people who very much dislike the sound of music<br/>in just intonation, and for those people, just intonation, even<br/>thought it sounds different, doesn&apos;t have much to offer.  But there<br/>are others of us - over 25% at least - who contrariwise like the<br/>sound of the just versions better, finding their emotional impact<br/>to be more pleasing and intense.  Should we be left out?</p><p>    There will always be people who initially react strongly against<br/>something which clashes with what they are used to hearing - the fact<br/>that it sounds &quot;different&quot; becomes psychologically equivalent to<br/>sounding &quot;off&quot; or &quot;funny&quot; or just &quot;wrong&quot; to them.</p><p>    Dave Hill     Borrego Springs, CA</p></div><h3><a id=39999 href="#39999">ðŸ”—</a>prophecyspirit@aol.com</h3><span>10/24/2002 8:49:13 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>In a message dated 10/24/02 6:13:59 AM Central Daylight Time,<br/><a href="mailto:ASCEND11@AOL.COM">ASCEND11@AOL.COM</a> writes:</p><p>&gt; There will always be people who initially react strongly against<br/>&gt; something which clashes with what they are used to hearing - the fact<br/>&gt; that it sounds &quot;different&quot; becomes psychologically equivalent to<br/>&gt; sounding &quot;off&quot; or &quot;funny&quot; or just &quot;wrong&quot; to them.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;     Dave Hill</p><p>Excellent post!</p><p>Pauline</p></div>
