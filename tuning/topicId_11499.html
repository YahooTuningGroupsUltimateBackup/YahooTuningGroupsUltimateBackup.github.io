Is there any way you could eliminate the<br/>12-tET chords, and perhaps lengthen the pseudo-JI examples? As it is, there<br/>are too many things to remember, and to remember to ignore, in such a short<br/>time, to allow me to turn on and off a focused mode of listening and compare<br/>the progressions musically.</p></div>
