This was<br/>stored as a MIDI format 0 file, which meant that all channel<br/>information was contained on one track. When I opened this in Sonar, I<br/>realized that I had to somehow extract the four parts so I could<br/>assign them to individual channels and then those to the different<br/>string instruments on the Synful plug. I managed to do that, as well<br/>as strip a lot of extraneous CC date (volume, pan, reverb, etc) that<br/>came from who knows where. I still could not figure out if it was a<br/>bug with Synful or something weird in the file, but try as I might I<br/>couldn&apos;t seat the players in the appropriate spot on stage. They<br/>should start correctly, with Violin 1 on your left, and the cello on<br/>your right. But they move around, damn it. Crackhead chamber musicians.</p><p>Anyway, here it is, a Synful rendition with NO tweaking of note<br/>values, etc. Only treatments were setting the quartet in a decent<br/>little chamber hall, courtesy of Roomverb M2.

To do strings realistically, *especially* solo strings<br/>instead of big section pads, you really have to have multiple samples,<br/>maps of velocity switching, and as you say, lots of edits. What I<br/>wanted to see was how much better Synful might sound if one were<br/>completely dumb about its use, and tried to just &apos;pour&apos; an existing<br/>midi thing into it. For me, it sure is a hell of a lot more convincing<br/>than a standard GM soundcard softsynth or simply picking a &quot;string&quot;<br/>sound in some soundfont. If one then spent time, lovingly crafting<br/>their work, the results could end up being fairly persuasive.</p><p>I mean, heck, all you have to do is listen to the Beethoven string<br/>quartet demo on their page - *that* is a very, very convincing and<br/>musical performance.

You could achieve a similar variety with expression and modulation controls (although it&apos;d really be nice to have a &quot;vibrato speed&quot; control as well....) If you want a realistic cello sound, you&apos;d need a way to explicitly control bow direction and articulation, speed, force, and distance from the bridge.

And if it works as a VST, what are<br/>&gt; it&apos;s advantages over the growing number of VST instruments that<br/>&gt; directly support non-12tet tunings?</p><p>I don&apos;t know first hand, because I don&apos;t use it that way what with still not having any MIDI gear plugged in.  I did get it to render a score in real time on my iBook (256 MB RAM), and it worked if I didn&apos;t touch anything while it was playing.  The problem currently is that there are so many different versions depending on your desires and platform.  The word on the mailing lists is that Csound5 is working well in real time under Linux, but other platforms need to catch up.  You have to mess around with the soundcard latency as well.</p><p>I expect it&apos;ll always be slower than one-trick-pony synths because of things like the use of floating point everywhere.  I think it&apos;s currently single threaded, which would limit the amount of hardware you can throw at it.  And you can only run one version of the Csound engine at a time,  That can be a problem with VST.  Some of the opcodes (fixed formant pitch shifting I think is one) won&apos;t take an input in real-time, and so obviously aren&apos;t designed to be used that way.</p><p>The main difficulty with getting started is that there isn&apos;t a set of GM instruments you can drop in, at least that I can find, and so you actually have to learn how everything works.  It can load samples from sound fonts but not the envelope and modulator data.</p><p>The advantages of using it would be that it&apos;s a free, powerful and stable (features over time) platform.  Soft synths seem to come and go, but once you have something working in Csound it should keep working at any point in the future, even if you have to render outside real time. And even if it doesn&apos;t work, all the source code&apos;s in plain text so you can try to work out what you did and adapt it to some other system.</p><p>I think the non real-time mode still counts as an advantage.  You can work out ideas and render them with higher quality.  Maybe VST already supports this.  And it works on a load of different hardware, and doesn&apos;t take long to get running.  That&apos;s the killer feature for me. But it also makes it difficult to get back to working with it, because you&apos;re confronted with a list of numbers that you&apos;ve forgotten the significance of.  At least, that&apos;s my excuse for not having anything to show yet ;)</p><p>For tuning, the advantage is that it&apos;s completely flexible.  You can do the things I was playing with in Kyma, crossfading between tunings, and adaptive tuning in so far as you can program it yourself.  The disadvantage is that it doesn&apos;t work with the MIDI tuning standard and so whatever hacks you use to get past the 128 note MIDI limit aren&apos;t likely to be shared by whatever software you&apos;re using.</p><p>&gt; Oh, and shouldn&apos;t we move this to MMM?</p><p>Don&apos;t see why.</p><p>&gt; Cheers, and hope you are well,</p><p>Thanks!

So<br/>while I don&apos;t for a minute disclaim Csound as a great resource, it<br/>does goes to the very edge of complexity in terms of setting up the<br/>software, dependencies, coding skill, groking concepts of programming,<br/>etc. We&apos;ve got people who have and are using it to great success, but<br/>it is not a panacea.
