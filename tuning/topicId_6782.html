I mean, sure it is, for<br/>copyright protection and other legalities in a modern society. And yes,<br/>the music does get played/composed by &quot;me&quot;; but, I truly feel like ideas<br/>are given to artists from &quot;somewhere else,&quot; so to speak...I know mine<br/>are. I think of art as a gift, and such a gift should always be shared.<br/>Once a composition goes out into the physical world, I don&apos;t feel like I<br/>&quot;own&quot; it. I really don&apos;t know why I feel like this, it seems like a part<br/>of what I am as a musician.( Maybe it&apos;s because I&apos;ve played so much<br/>blues and jazz, where the emphasis is always on individual<br/>interpretation of certain basic materials. In fact, you try and AVOID<br/>sounding like someone else, if possible...to have individual style is<br/>the thing.) Yeah, I&apos;d rather hear somebody do something good with it, if<br/>possible; but, I don&apos;t even feel like I have the right to tell someone<br/>else what to do with art. To me, imagination is the most powerful part<br/>of art, so if something happens that is imaginative, I don&apos;t really care<br/>how they got there...Weird Al&apos;s version of Michael Jackson&apos;s &quot;Beat It&quot;<br/>is a mighty creative use of someone else&apos;s material, for instance. And<br/>Kazuhito Yamashita does solo guitar transcriptions of symphonic works,<br/>to make them accessible for everybody to experience...I like that<br/>concept of music; it seems very heartfelt.. I am honored if someone<br/>likes my stuff enough to even want to do it in the first place..what a<br/>nice tribute. Far be it from me to say no in such a circumstance...but,<br/>it really isn&apos;t an issue to me if folks have another approach. I&apos;d like<br/>to think we can respect each other&apos;s ideas in a peaceful way....Hstick<br/>PS Miles said that Mingus used to do weird stuff, like play &quot;My Funny<br/>Valentine&quot; in a major key...has anybody done Partch in 12 eq yet?)</p></div><h3>Robert C Valentine &#x3C;bval@xxx.xxxxx.xxxx&#x3E;</h3><span>12/9/1999 1:24:40 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>&gt;<br/>&gt; and what I found was: on some deep, fundamental Universal level, I<br/>&gt; really don&apos;t feel like my music is &quot;my&quot; music.</p><p>Thanks Neil, for coming back to the list, and also for writing this.<br/>I guess I see &quot;my music&quot; like my children, beyond a certain point<br/>they are their own thing and will go off and be whatever they&apos;ll be<br/>whether I like it or not.</p><p>&gt;  Yeah, I&apos;d rather hear somebody do something good with it, if<br/>&gt; possible; but, I don&apos;t even feel like I have the right to tell someone<br/>&gt; else what to do with art.</p><p>Something good, or at least, honest and respectful. Unfortunately, all<br/>these terms are purely subjective. If you are lucky enough<br/>to have people care about your music, then some of them will care enough<br/>to pan it, and maybe even, through ignorance or maliciousness, play it<br/>in a manner that that you disagree with (whether the specifics of that<br/>are key, tempo, timbre, tuning, etc... doesn&apos;t really make any difference,<br/>you don&apos;t LIKE it).</p><p>Oh well, I would rather my daughter not smoke.

I think of art as a gift, and such a gift should always be shared.</p><p>I think many of us are sympathetic with these ideas and agree. The music is<br/>shared by the listening experience. My father as I mentioned before, was a<br/>psychic among other things, my own relationship to such things, I rather<br/>not make public. Music comes from somewhere else, maybe mine comes from<br/>Anaphoria. That these sound children have a life of there own is a fact of<br/>life. Still I would rather prefer to give them a good head start especially<br/>if they involve uncommon elements. Samuel Becket made sure he had some<br/>involvement in every production of his work even if it was only via the<br/>phone. As far as my works lasting beyond myself, I would hope that others<br/>would just do as i do in spirit more than reproducing what has already been<br/>done. Partch&apos;s work is so tied in with the man, especially the vocal works,<br/>that i consider the gate 5 recordings the &quot;finished&quot; product. I really<br/>don&apos;t need or desire new recordings. Hopefully his works will be done in<br/>collaboration with those trained in theater and I don&apos;t mean broadway. This<br/>other side of the man (there is more than 2) requires a director at least<br/>who can understand those aspects of his work. I am not criticizing the<br/>reproductions that have been done, but unless you have this dual<br/>background,  a director would be capable of seeing what you cannot.</p><p>&gt; ...Hstick<br/>&gt; PS Miles said that Mingus used to do weird stuff, like play &quot;My Funny<br/>&gt; Valentine&quot; in a major key...has anybody done Partch in 12 eq yet?)</p><p>As Ben Johnson pointed out that the reason Diana Ross Failed at Billy<br/>Holiday was she sang the wrong intonation. to suggest it with Partch (I<br/>know you are not serious)<br/>DEM UR FIGHTIN WURDS DER MISTAR :)</p><p>-- Kraig Grady<br/>North American Embassy of Anaphoria Island<br/><a href="http://www.anaphoria.com">http://www.anaphoria.com</a></p></div><h3>Joe Monzo &#x3C;monz@xxxx.xxxx&#x3E;</h3><span>12/9/1999 2:41:48 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>&gt; [Neil Haverstick, TD 430.4]<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; ... on some deep, fundamental Universal level, I really<br/>&gt; don&apos;t feel like my music is &quot;my&quot; music.

I know<br/>exactly where you&apos;re coming from.  Sometimes I listen to<br/>some of my favorites of my own stuff and they don&apos;t even<br/>seem like mine - I experience the same kind of thing as when<br/>I listen to someone else&apos;s work.</p><p>That not to say that I can&apos;t respect the attitude of<br/>Wolf, Grady, Szanto, Reinhard, et al.  My compositions<br/>are my &apos;children&apos;, and always will be, as long as I&apos;m<br/>alive, so, on the one hand, there&apos;s a sense of protection<br/>about them, and a feeling that, if I felt it was good<br/>enough to be let out into the public in the first place,<br/>it&apos;s good enough to stay as it was when I let it go.</p><p>But on the other hand, just like with real children, time<br/>has a way of altering circumstances and issues, and the<br/>works themselves, if they strike a &apos;chord&apos; of response<br/>from anyone out there in the listening audience, will<br/>tend to &apos;grow&apos; just like real children too.</p><p>OK, I&apos;m not going to stretch that metaphor any farther...</p><p>&gt; ...has anybody done Partch in 12 eq yet?)</p><p>Uh...
