Did you just move it up and down until it gave a desired &gt;&gt; beat rate against some A?  Which A?<br/>&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; My dear colleague, I have made it very clear that I took 440 Hz for &gt; A and 220 Hz for tenor A as per your instructions. Follow the math, &gt; you can&apos;t go wrong there. F-A in the tenor region beats exactly 6 &gt; times per second as you wanted if you assign it the value 877/550. &gt; The berth from A down to F is 877/1100 if you trust your recipe.<br/>&gt;<br/>SNIP</p><p>Sorry for the typo. I meant to say 3 times per second in the tenor F-A.</p></div>
