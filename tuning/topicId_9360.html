That would seem to be very little pressure on<br/>the wood, unless your frets are not much more further apart than a couple widths of<br/>the fret wire, which is clearly not going to be playable by anybody (with the<br/>possible exception of superwiz like Neil Haverstick!).  Or to draw an analogy, even<br/>a soft wood like pine rarely cracks if you drill a pilot hole for a screw that<br/>matches the inside diameter of the threads.</p></div>
