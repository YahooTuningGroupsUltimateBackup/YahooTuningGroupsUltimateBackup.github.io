Figured out how to force Real Audio to download a file for later<br/>consumption, at least on my Windows 95/98 platforms.</p><p>   . From Explorer (not Internet Explorer, but the local one), pick<br/>     View, Folder options, File types (from Win95, View, Options,<br/>     File types).</p><p>   . Slide down the list till you get to RealAudio; there may be one<br/>     or more.  For each...</p><p>   . Click Edit, then turn ON the box &quot;Confirm Open after Download&quot;,<br/>     then OK, OK, OK.</p><p>   . Now whenever you click on a Real Audio file, you&apos;ll get a chance<br/>     to download it instead of playing it.</p><p>There&apos;s still the hassle of the .ram file vs. the .ra file.  You have to<br/>get &quot;past&quot; the .ram file by examining its contents, then specifying<br/>them as the URL address - this lets you download the actual file.  Once<br/>you get the hang, you can guess the actual file name and skip<br/>downloading the .ram file.</p><p>I&apos;m just a &quot;download it for later (repeated) consumption&quot; kind of guy;<br/>also my fast internet connection is at work, where (for some odd reason)<br/>the computers have no sound cards!</p><p>JdL</p></div>
