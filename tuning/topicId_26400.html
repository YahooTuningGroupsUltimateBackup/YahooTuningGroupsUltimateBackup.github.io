Time is an extremely important part of music.<br/>&gt; &gt; Lattices, analysis, etc, should reflect it if possible.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Exactly. Monz&apos;s JustMusic software is intended to show the music<br/>&gt; evolving on the lattice, by &quot;lighting up&quot; the pitches that are being<br/>&gt; played at any given time. This could be very &quot;illuminating&quot;, though<br/>&gt; Monz and I differ in how we like to construct our lattices.</p><p>Thanks very much for the plug, Paul!</p><p>Don&apos;t forget... my intention is to have JustMusic be able to<br/>do *any* kind of lattice the user requires.  I&apos;ve only implemented<br/>my version first for obvious reasons... it&apos;s *my* software!   ;-)</p><p>&gt; for me, lattices have been extremely enlightening in many situations<br/>&gt; and so it&apos;s always a convenient lens for peering at any particular<br/>&gt; problem . . . all the pitches and their relationships with one<br/>&gt; another are mapped out in a _static_ way, so that the _dynamics_ of<br/>&gt; the music can be viewed against an unchanging background . . . why<br/>&gt; should that be such a problem for you?</p><p>This is a *really* good point about static/dynamic!, in light of<br/>the discussion here regarding time as an element of music.</p><p>I sent a post this afternoon discussing the fact that harmony<br/>itself, at least when considered as ratios, is also time-dependent.</p><p>I&apos;d also like JustMusic to be able to analyze harmonic timbres<br/>on lattice diagrams.  And hey, why not rhythms or meters too?</p><p>A lattice can be useful for understanding *any* type of rational<br/>or proportional relationship, and thus for examing any type of<br/>periodicity that can be found in music.  And periodicity plays<br/>a role in a *lot* of different aspects of music!
