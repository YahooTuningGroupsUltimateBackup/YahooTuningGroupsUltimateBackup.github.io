I realize that advanced abstract concepts, in any field, can certainly be difficult, even for folks with knowledge and experience of the subject. As a long time teacher, I try to figure out ways to pass info to students of varying degrees of ability and intelligence...most of the time, I&apos;m successful. You have to take people exactly where they are at, and start from there.</p><p>   I think music/tuning is for everybody, and all should be able to be involved if they are interested, regardless of age. I have young students who are interested in such concepts as well temps, and they understand the basic concepts pretty well. Yes, it may not be for everybody, but neither is auto mechanics. But, I&apos;d like to think that tuning ideas can be explained simple enough for a child to understand them; a balance between intellect and intuition is a good idea, and being able to explain abstract concepts simply is a great gift. I think it can and should be done...Hstick</p><p><a href="http://myspace.com/microstick">myspace.com/microstick</a></p></div><h3>Gene Ward Smith &#x3C;genewardsmith@sbcglobal.net&#x3E;</h3><span>9/25/2007 3:21:41 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, &lt;microstick@...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;    There&apos;s a quote from Einstein somewhere, sorry I don&apos;t have it in<br/>front of me...but, he said something to the effect that if the<br/>Universal laws could not be put in simple enough form to be explained<br/>to a child, then they probably weren&apos;t worth much (anybody know the<br/>quote?).</p><p>If your child can do graduate-level math, this should work out fine<br/>with Einstein.</p></div>
