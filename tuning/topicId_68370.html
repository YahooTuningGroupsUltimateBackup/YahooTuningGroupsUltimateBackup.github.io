Obviously I must have missed it during my search for on-line resources for teaching Turkish.</p><p>  Exploring the entire domain of Turkic musics has always been an exciting venture for me. It is spread over such a vast geographical area of our planet. Yet - I am speculating that - there must be commonalities linking them in some structural form. I am also speculating that around the globe about 300,000,000 people speak Turkish in some form.</p><p>  May I, with your permission, try clarify the association, or lack thereof, between our names in the interest of informing our friends in the Tuning List community.</p><p>  When I first introduce myself in the US orally as *Jon*, people naturally associate my name with the Christian name *John*. Then a disclaimer has to follow from my end, which is usully very confusing for the other side. I try to explain - despite the similarities in the phonemes involved - my name has nothing to do with the Christian name John, and that it is a Farsi (Persian) word, meaning *soul* in English. Furthermore, the Turkish word for John is Yahya.</p><p>  The real pandemonium breaks when they see my name in print, i.e. *Can*. It is usually associated with things like *beer can*. They probably wonder why anyone would be named *can*, as in a tin can. In fact, my nickname (full name: Can Akkoc) among the students - when I taught at a special high school for the gifted - was *can of coke*.</p><p>  Then, I have to explain that, while the Arabic script was used during the Ottoman days, we changed into the Latin script in 1926 under the new Republic of Turkey, thus the spelling *Can*.</p><p>  I hope this is not confusing for the wonderful peple on this list. Coming from that part of the Planet, I know it is not going to be confusing for you.</p><p>  Kindest regards,</p><p>  Can Akkoc (crude transliteration: Jon Ahkcoach)</p><p>yahya_melb &lt;<a href="mailto:yahya@melbpc.org.au">yahya@melbpc.org.au</a>&gt; wrote:</p><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, Can Akkoc wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Ladies and Gentlemen,<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Anyone interested in learning or - for that matter - teaching<br/>conversational Turkish (English based), please note the following<br/>Internet address.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; It is virtually an *on-line language laboratory* for beginning<br/>Turkish.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; <a href="http://languagelab.bh.indiana.edu/Turkish.html">http://languagelab.bh.indiana.edu/Turkish.html</a><br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Can Akko&iuml;&iquest;&half;<br/>&gt; - - - - - -</p><p>Thank you for that reference, Can.</p><p>Might I also point out some lovely music available<br/>from the same site:<br/><a href="http://languagelab.bh.indiana.edu/silk_road.html">http://languagelab.bh.indiana.edu/silk_road.html</a></p><p>For something different, start with the first Uzbek<br/>piece.</p><p>Regards,<br/>Yahya</p></div>
