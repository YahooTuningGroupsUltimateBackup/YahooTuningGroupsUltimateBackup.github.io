Hence<br/>we may notate every note of 441 in what is, effectively, 1/4-comma<br/>meantone notation. That means we can do ennealimmal, semithirds, and<br/>effective 7-limit JI in 1/4-comma meantone notation, or close enough<br/>for government work. Of course, the results will be a mess unless more<br/>symbols are introduced.</p></div><h3>Gene Ward Smith &#x3C;genewardsmith@coolgoose.com&#x3E;</h3><span>2/28/2007 3:37:40 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;Gene Ward Smith&quot; &lt;genewardsmith@...&gt;<br/>wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; 441-et supports an almost exact 1/4-comma meantone; the 5 of 441-et<br/>is<br/>&gt; 2^10 = 1024 steps, a number which is, obviously, divisible by 4.<br/>Hence<br/>&gt; we may notate every note of 441 in what is, effectively, 1/4-comma<br/>&gt; meantone notation.</p><p>If someone really wants to do this, here&apos;s how: the 1/4 comma meantone<br/>fifth of 441 is 256 steps, so if n is the number of steps associated by<br/>&lt;441 699 1024 1238| to a 7-limit, then n/256 mod 441, which is the same<br/>as 205*n mod 441, is how many fifths up or down (using the range -220<br/>to +220) to get to the octave class in question. So, for instance, the<br/>fifth, which is 258 steps, is 205*258 mod 441 = -30 meantone fifths,<br/>and is notated as Bbbbbb. A pure major triad is C-E-Bbbbbb. B followed<br/>by 30 sharps is a 7. One may suspect this system isn&apos;t really very<br/>practical.</p></div>
