Would the answer be obtainable<br/>by deep digging into old books, etc.?  An American music<br/>encyclopedia published in 1854 describes a &quot;wolf&quot; occurring<br/>between the &quot;bearing notes&quot; of keyed instruments.  The<br/>size of this wolf is called a diaschisma, which, reckoning<br/>from other entries in the encyclopedia computes to about<br/>36 cents (half a minor semitone).  It would be almost 39 cents<br/>if it were half a minor mean tone semitone, but I think<br/>it&apos;s half of the step 1/1 to 25/24, which is about 72 cents.<br/>It&apos;s quite a distance from Italy around 1700 to the United<br/>States in 1854, but at least quarter comma mean tone seems<br/>to have been still around that recently in some parts of the<br/>world.  I&apos;d bet that if one had the patience to dig through<br/>newspapers from the 19th century in a place like the New<br/>York library, some extremely informative little gems of<br/>information about earlier tuning practices would likely<br/>come to light.  I recall visiting a library in France -<br/>Quimper in Brittany - where there were books from at least<br/>as far back as the 18th century in their collection of books.<br/>If one were to dig through some old libraries in Europe, one<br/>might be able to piece together a pretty good picture of what<br/>really was going on with tuning systems from earlier times.</p><p>    Dave Hill, Borrego Springs, CA</p></div><h3>paulerlich &#x3C;paul@stretch-music.com&#x3E;</h3><span>3/27/2002 2:14:54 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In tuning@y..., ASCEND11@A... wrote:</p><p>&gt; If one were to dig through some old libraries in Europe, one<br/>&gt; might be able to piece together a pretty good picture of what<br/>&gt; really was going on with tuning systems from earlier times.</p><p>i think this is exactly what people like lindley and chesnut have<br/>done, and it&apos;s great that we have their summaries, but of course<br/>there&apos;s no substitute for first-hand materials.</p></div>
