Something like that would be more than adequate, for MMM as well! Also to<br/>host a list if one got together a suitabl script. It actually has a free discussion board with the site. That&apos;s ipowerweb though<br/>there are other good ones as well I&apos;m sure.</p><p>It will be a good few months before I use it all myself actually surely. I could add an ftp account to it for tuning files with its<br/>own special folder to upload to and password if we don&apos;t mind all files being accessible to everyone. Surely if someone felt like<br/>doing scripts for it one could also sort out a Yahoo type file area, maybe some of the discussion boards already have such.</p><p>It would be a stop-gap measure until we have a permanent home because maybe eventually I will need it for something, such as mp3s of<br/>fractal tunes or such like. I can see that the whole lot could easily get filled eventually. But since the larger files are<br/>temporary examples (well to MMM anyway), anyway maybe this could be useful. They could be linked to from another site. I have a 30<br/>Gb per month bandwidth allowance and even with 300 * 3 MB if everyone downloaded a large file (unlikely) that wouldn&apos;t make much of<br/>a dent in it, only one day&apos;s worth of bandwidth.</p><p>Anyway if anyone wants to use a folder there, say <a href="http://www.robertinventor.com/tuning/">http://www.robertinventor.com/tuning/</a> for temporary large files for a few months,<br/>then just say and I&apos;ll set it up right now. You can link to them from other domains too (within reason of course, can&apos;t go so far as<br/>to make a new microtonal mp3 site much as I&apos;d like to) such as <a href="http://microtonal.org">microtonal.org</a>. It is paid up for the next year so whatever happens<br/>to me then it should be okay for getting on for a year anyway. I&apos;ll warn in good time if the files need to be removed later on.<br/>Shouldn&apos;t have any problem there with partial downloads.</p><p>Hopefully by then will have sorted things out. I&apos;d be happy to pay $10 per year to make sure that there is a permanent home for<br/>tuning / MMM files and we would only need ten such. Or 20 people paying $5 per year each.</p><p>BTW (other discussion) wherever the tuninglist goes I think it sounds a great idea to have a <a href="http://tuninglist.com">tuninglist.com</a> or some such domain as a<br/>uniform url. Doesn&apos;t prevent it from also having another url as well.</p><p>Thanks,</p><p>Robert</p></div><h3>Paul Erlich &#x3C;paul@stretch-music.com&#x3E;</h3><span>11/11/2003 4:12:51 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;Robert Walker&quot; &lt;robertwalker@n...&gt;<br/>wrote:</p><p>&gt; Anyway if anyone wants to use a folder there, say<br/>&gt;<a href="http://www.robertinventor.com/tuning/">http://www.robertinventor.com/tuning/</a> for temporary large files for<br/>&gt;a few months,<br/>&gt; then just say and I&apos;ll set it up right now.</p><p>a wonderful offer, robert. in anyone didn&apos;t know, there&apos;s also<br/><a href="http://groups.yahoo.com/group/tuning_files/">http://groups.yahoo.com/group/tuning_files/</a> . . .</p></div>
