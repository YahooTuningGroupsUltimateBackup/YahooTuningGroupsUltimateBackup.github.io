The picture takes up<br/>about 12K (bytes) of disk space.  That Email message took about 16 seconds<br/>to retrieve from my ISP.</p><p>So suppose a message had 5 seconds worth of audio encoded as 16-bit<br/>monaural samples at 8KHz, with no compression.  (That would be fine for<br/>illustration purposes unless high harmonics are really important.)  That<br/>would be a total of 80KB, which apparently would take about 1 3/4 minutes<br/>to transfer.  If there were four such messages waiting for you, it would<br/>take about 7 minutes.  It would require the proverbial coffee break, but<br/>not much more.</p></div>
