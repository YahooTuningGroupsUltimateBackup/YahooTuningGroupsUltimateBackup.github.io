In total 3 noticeable faults: E too low, C# too high, F<br/>&gt;too high.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;~~~T~~~</p><p>And against your anecdote of disliking A major, Tom, I have an anecdote of at least equal weight, saying it works beautifully on a &quot;real instrument&quot;.  For what such anecdotes are worth.....</p><p>In a recent visit to the organ in Indiana, I videotaped myself playing the two &quot;Orgelbuchlein&quot; settings of &quot;Liebster Jesu&quot;, BWV 633 and 634.  Both are in A major and both have complicated canonic textures, with the various weirdnesses that arise from close canon.  And they work perfectly fine, with no &quot;noticeable faults&quot; anywhere.</p><p>That&apos;s this organ in particular:<br/><a href="http://www-personal.umich.edu/~bpl/larips/tb41.html">http://www-personal.umich.edu/~bpl/larips/tb41.html</a><br/>There&apos;s also one in Finland now, as described on this page:<br/><a href="http://www-personal.umich.edu/~bpl/larips/usage.html">http://www-personal.umich.edu/~bpl/larips/usage.html</a></p><p>Likewise I play the A major English Suite for myself all the time at home, on harpsichord, and it works beautifully with a colorful and exciting &quot;glow&quot; to it; I especially like what it does with the Sarabande and the Allemande.</p><p>Use the tuning in real music, not just playing a couple of isolated chords and scales....  :)  The linear motion of contrapuntal writing is really nothing like hitting a couple of chords in isolation; and this temperament fosters a melodically-oriented approach to performance anyway (i.e. not merely basking in chord progressions or static harmonic moments).  I noticed that especially in BWV 633 and 634, as the temperament keeps the canonic voices moving forward with their tensions.  The temperament sounds almost Pythagorean there, with high and tense leading-tones needing to resolve forward.</p><p>And listen to your harpsichord at 1, 2, 5, 10, and 20 meters away: you&apos;ll be surprised at the amount of &quot;projection&quot; this temperament has at the various distances.  Play in various sizes and types of rooms, and on other people&apos;s harpsichords!</p><p>On my harpsichord recording I picked one of the most audacious A-major pieces where it allegedly shouldn&apos;t work, but it does: the Sarabande of Suite BWV 832, with big thick chords hitting the hottest spots in A major and E major.  To be released later this month, in this album:<br/><a href="http://www-personal.umich.edu/~bpl/larips/cd1003.html">http://www-personal.umich.edu/~bpl/larips/cd1003.html</a></p><p>Further...on the assertion that my A major has &quot;E too low, C# too high, F too high....&quot;--how much time have you spent playing harpsichord repertoire using regular 1/6 comma all the way, as in leaving it on the instrument for at least a week and playing through piles of everything?  The E and the F are exactly where they are in regular 1/6, vis-a-vis A!  &quot;Too low&quot; and &quot;too high&quot; for what, according to what expectation?  (They&apos;d be even farther off your mark, if you&apos;re accustomed to play 16th-17th repertoire in 1/4 comma for long sessions, as is a pretty standard thing for harpsichordists to do nowadays!  Coming into this from that side of history, i.e. chronologically moving forward out of the 17th century, this Bach thing sounds ultra-modern and suave; the same distinction that I believe CPE Bach made in the 1750s, drawing similar contrast of old vs current.)</p><p>Granted, the C# is rather higher than its corresponding position within many other contemporary temperaments, but it&apos;s only (and exactly) halfway up from A to F.  That is, the note C#/Db is mean, creating two identical major 3rds A-C# and Db-F.  For your assertion that C# is &quot;too high&quot; (for what?), someone could offer the equally important observation that Db is &quot;too low&quot; in all the other temperaments, making Bach&apos;s F-minor music (and some C minor and G minor as well) sound rotten!</p><p>Bradley Lehman<br/><a href="http://www.larips.com">http://www.larips.com</a></p></div><h3><a id=61315 href="#61315">ðŸ”—</a>monz &#x3C;monz@tonalsoft.com&#x3E;</h3><span>10/11/2005 10:13:47 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Hi Tom,</p><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;Tom Dent&quot; &lt;stringph@g...&gt; wrote:</p><p>&gt; Anyway, I have tried the tuning on a real instrument<br/>&gt; (harpsichord).</p><p>What makes the harpsichord a &quot;real instrument&quot;?</p><p>If your purpose is to differentiate it from electronic<br/>instruments which are capable of producing sounds which<br/>imitate or emulate a harpsichord, it would be less<br/>inflammatory to refer to the harpsichord as an<br/>&quot;acoustic instrument&quot;.</p><p>My computer produces &quot;real music&quot;, so apparently<br/>my computer must be a &quot;real instrument&quot;.</p><p>-monz<br/><a href="http://tonalsoft.com">http://tonalsoft.com</a><br/>Tonescape microtonal music software</p></div><h3><a id=61317 href="#61317">ðŸ”—</a>George D.

A typical keyboard improv for me has<br/>left hand arpeggios over pedal notes, with fairly full chords held<br/>in the right hand in positions close enough to allow some play of<br/>melody and occasional ornament either above or within the chord.<br/>(I hope this description is adequate.)  Oh yes, I prefer to play<br/>mostly in a legato style.  This all means that at any moment the<br/>left hand usually has at least two held notes and the right hand<br/>at least three held notes, all from the current harmony.  In such<br/>a style, I wonder whether I can really hear many of the beats at<br/>all.  Perhaps I should have written &quot;less noticeable beats&quot; rather<br/>than &quot;slower beats&quot;.  But I did make some efforts to play a few<br/>chords of two and three notes in each key, and generally found<br/>these less objectionable in Brad&apos;s temp than in 12EDO.</p><p>&gt; Perhaps it is due to the phenomenon of &apos;intermittent beating&apos; noted<br/>&gt; for example by Lindley. This means that the most objectionable beats<br/>&gt; are not the fastest, but those at a frequency of about 10 per second.<br/>&gt; So at a certain point, it makes the sound &apos;smoother&apos; to have *more*<br/>&gt; frequent beats.</p><p>This may be so, but I personally found beat rates of 0.5 to 3 Hz<br/>much more objectionable than those of 10 to 15 Hz, with those<br/>in between being more moderately tolerable.  The slowest beats<br/>I heard tended to cause the entire sound to flutter in volume<br/>in a rather nauseating way.  I imagined this might have something<br/>to do with lower frequencies carrying greater power.  But that<br/>would make no sense unless the sound envelope can evolve in such<br/>a way that one partial can &quot;steal&quot; power from others - and that<br/>seems improbable given that my sound source was the samples<br/>on a chip, rather than vibrating strings.</p><p>&gt; Perhaps Yahya just likes near-Pythagorean tuning?</p><p>I don&apos;t think so!

I don&apos;t,<br/>&gt; &gt; frankly, think that I could possibly _hear_ either ofthe Pyth.<br/>&gt; &gt; thirds as a ratio - rather, I would only be accepting them<br/>&gt; &gt; as a notional representation (just as I do in 12EDO) of the<br/>&gt; &gt; just intervals.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I suppose what I meant was, if your preferences are in the<br/>&gt; direction of 5/4 and 6/5, then it is curious that you would<br/>&gt; prefer a tuning whose intervals (at least in the relevant keys)<br/>&gt; are farther from those values than ET is. In fact C#-E is,<br/>&gt; exactly, 32/27.</p><p>I have no explanation!  :-)</p><p>&gt; &gt; &gt; ... on a real instrument (harpsichord).<br/>&gt; &gt; ... which creates several simultaneous and interacting sound<br/>&gt; &gt; sources, rather than on independent samples from real<br/>&gt; &gt; instruments, including harpsichords and pianos, which can<br/>&gt; &gt; only interact in space and the listener&apos;s ear, rather than<br/>&gt; &gt; in those places and also within the instrument itself ...  Yes,<br/>&gt; &gt; I guess we should expect _some_ differences in results.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; A good explanation of the point of wood-and-metal-and-leather as<br/>&gt; opposed to electronically generated sounds. Also, any &apos;acoustic&apos;<br/>&gt; instrument has a *unique* profile of upper partials, thus setting any<br/>&gt; tuning in a new light. However, all that is filtered again through my<br/>&gt; opinions...</p><p>But musical tuning, no matter how mathematical or<br/>experimental it becomes, will never be an exact science,<br/>will it?  There remains, I believe, quite a bit of room for<br/>difference of musical opinion ...</p><p>&gt; &gt; &gt; (...) I didn&apos;t like the sound of a full A major<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; chord at all. In total 3 noticeable faults: E too low, C# too<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; high, F too high.<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; Tom, was that F perhaps an A?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; No, I meant what I think the faults are, not just focusing on<br/>&gt; one key but taking the *whole* of the circle into account.

So you&apos;re saying you<br/>like 3 to 10 Hz beating less than 10 to 15 Hz beating, and 0.5 to<br/>3 Hz  beating less still?</p><p>[YA]<br/>Yep.</p><p>[PE]<br/>Wow. Are all these beat rates referring to the beating of upper<br/>partials in a not-quite-JI chord?</p><p>[YA]<br/>For example, if I play an A major triad on my piano with the A tuned<br/>to 220 Hz, the C# to 275 Hz and the E tuned to 331 Hz, then I&apos;ll get<br/>beats between the 3rd partial of the A at 660 Hz and the 2nd partial<br/>of the E at 662 Hz.  These beats will be at 662 - 660 = 2 Hz.</p><p>[PE]<br/>So, as you tune the chord further and further away from JI, and the<br/>beating gets faster and faster, the chord sounds better and better to<br/>you?</p><p>[YA]<br/>Not really better; just less bad.  The only chords that sound good are<br/>those that are perfectly in tune.  The most annoying chords are the<br/>_nearly_ perfect ones, those that sound most like JI but are just out<br/>of tune.</p><p>[PE]<br/>Wow. This is the first time I&apos;ve seen this reaction, including in the<br/>results of a number of experiments that have been performed on the<br/>mistuning of chords.</p><p>   - Hope I don&apos;t mess up your HE curves! :-)</p><p>[YA]<br/>Once they get far enough away from that, it no longer seems<br/>to me that the tuner has made any effort to achieve that particular<br/>harmony.  But, as I said earlier, in a given musical context I can accept<br/>that the sounds I&apos;m hearing are _supposed_ to represent that harmony<br/>- that they are a &quot;notional&quot; rather than an actual major triad, for<br/>instance.</p><p>[PE]<br/>If the beating is at a rate of 1 or 2 beats per second, but the<br/>harmony moves along at a decent pace, you can no longer hear the<br/>beating. Are the chords still annoying to you nonetheless?</p><p>  * Not if I can&apos;t hear the beating.  In very fast music, my ability to<br/>     discriminate between pitches also goes WAY down.</p><p>[YA]<br/>{begin OT}<br/>In this context, I don&apos;t know what (prime) limit I recognise in<br/>tuning;</p><p>[PE]<br/>How about odd limit?</p><p>  * No.</p><p>[YA]<br/>... certainly, some very tiny variations in pitch evoke entirely<br/>different sensations in various oriental musics I&apos;m familiar with,<br/>including Chinese opera, erhu playing, shakuhachi playing, classical<br/>Indian playing and singing, the best Bollywood singing.  Do I hear<br/>the 19-limit, or perhaps the 23-limit?  I really couldn&apos;t say; nor do<br/>I know how to find out.</p><p>[PE]<br/>Are you sure the question is even meaningful, Yahya?</p><p>  * Sure?  No.  But I think it may be.  Would a musical tuning that<br/>     requires 137-limit intervals be meaningful, Paul, if we couldn&apos;t<br/>     hear the difference between that and, say, the 19-limit?</p><p>[YA]<br/> ... The slowest beats<br/>I heard tended to cause the entire sound to flutter in volume<br/>in a rather nauseating way.  I imagined this might have<br/>something to do with lower frequencies carrying greater power.<br/>But that would make no sense unless the sound envelope can<br/>evolve in such a way that one partial can &quot;steal&quot; power from<br/>others - and that seems improbable given that my sound source<br/>was the samples on a chip, rather than vibrating strings.</p><p>[PE]<br/>I think you&apos;re confusing the frequency of a pressure variation<br/>(which can carry power) with the frequency of an amplitude<br/>variation (which can&apos;t). The former are &quot;notes&quot; or &quot;partials&quot;,<br/>the latter aren&apos;t.</p><p>[YA]<br/>A sound wave is a pressure wave, isn&apos;t it?</p><p>[PE]<br/>Yes, but a beating isn&apos;t.</p><p>[YA]<br/>???</p><p>Are you saying that the difference tone created by playing two<br/>pure sine waves of different frequency is not also a sound wave?</p><p>[PE]<br/>Ah, this is a common confusion.</p><p>The difference tone is a result of the nonlinear response of the ear,<br/>and is completely separate/distinct from the beating phenomenon.</p><p>Once through the nonlinear elements of the ear, the signal does<br/>indeed contain frequency components corresponding to the difference<br/>frequency, as well as other frequencies not present in the original<br/>sound.</p><p>[YA]<br/>OK.

The loudness of<br/>the difference tone and other nonlinear combinational tones increases<br/>*nonlinearly* (surprise) and generally in an accelerating manner as<br/>one increases the loudness of the original sound.</p><p>[YA]<br/> If that were so, it [the beat] would be inaudible.</p><p>[PE]<br/>It *is* inaudible (that is, there is no heard pitch corresponding to<br/>the difference frequency) under conditions of exactly linear<br/>response.</p><p>[YA]<br/> ... which don&apos;t exist except as an approximation good at very low<br/>power ...</p><p>[PE]<br/>Low loudness.</p><p>  * Why is the distinction important here?</p><p>[PE]<br/>Bill Sethares, in his book, claims that combinational<br/>tones are irrelevant to music and tuning because they are too quiet<br/>to matter at normal music listening levels.

Beating, meanwhile is a variation in loudness, which is<br/>heard to modulate a pitch which corrsponds to the average, not the<br/>difference, of the two sine-wave frequencies. Beating does not<br/>disappear at quiet volumes; difference tones and other combinational<br/>tones do.</p><p>[YA]<br/>I remember some maths trickery involving the basic trig identities:<br/>sin (A+B) = sin A cos B + cos A sin B, and<br/>cos (A+B) = cos A cos B - sin A sin B,<br/>together with the substitutions u = (A+B)/2, v = (A-B)/2,<br/>the semi-sum (average) and semi-difference of the original terms ...<br/>or vice versa! ... but can&apos;t recall what this was used to prove ... it&apos;s too<br/>many years ago now to remember this detail.</p><p>[PE]<br/>As you can see, I used some similar identities to derive the results<br/>of a quadratic nonlinearity on a pair of pure tones sounding together.</p><p>  * Thought you might.</p><p>[PE]<br/> ...

Do I hear<br/>&gt;&gt; the 19-limit, or perhaps the 23-limit?  I really couldn&apos;t say; nor<br/>&gt;do<br/>&gt;&gt; I know how to find out.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt; [PE]<br/>&gt;&gt; Are you sure the question is even meaningful, Yahya?<br/>&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt;   * Sure?  No.  But I think it may be.  Would a musical tuning that<br/>&gt;&gt;      requires 137-limit intervals be meaningful, Paul, if we<br/>&gt;couldn&apos;t<br/>&gt;&gt;      hear the difference between that and, say, the 19-limit?</p><p>Musical tunings &quot;meaningful&quot;? That&apos;s not the question. But the<br/>question of whether a particular prime limit is or isn&apos;t in<br/>force . . . since there&apos;s no limit on the sizes of the numbers in the<br/>ratios, you can always find more and more ratios within the prime<br/>limit that are closer and closer to a given ratio. At what point do<br/>these high-numbered ratios leave the realm of musical relevance? Of<br/>course it depends on the tuning system, but my point is that a prime<br/>limit alone doesn&apos;t seem to be capable of unambiguously corresponding<br/>or not corresponding, in general, to an arbitrary tuning system, via<br/>any aural or even mathematical test, as long as one recognizes a<br/>finite uncertainty in hearing intervals (or even merely the minimal<br/>uncertainty allowed by the classical uncertainty<br/>principle . . .) . . . The exceptions would seem to be cases where an<br/>odd, integer, or other &quot;finitary&quot; limit is ascertained first, and<br/>then the prime limit is simply taken as the largest prime not<br/>exceeding that limit.</p><p>&gt;&gt; [PE]<br/>&gt;&gt; For quiet sounds, the nonlinearity is insignificant. The loudness<br/>of<br/>&gt;&gt; the difference tone and other nonlinear combinational tones<br/>increases<br/>&gt;&gt; *nonlinearly* (surprise) and generally in an accelerating manner as<br/>&gt;&gt; one increases the loudness of the original sound.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; [YA]<br/>&gt;&gt;  If that were so, it [the beat] would be inaudible.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; [PE]<br/>&gt;&gt; It *is* inaudible (that is, there is no heard pitch corresponding<br/>to<br/>&gt;&gt; the difference frequency) under conditions of exactly linear<br/>&gt;&gt; response.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; [YA]<br/>&gt;&gt;  ... which don&apos;t exist except as an approximation good at very low<br/>&gt;&gt; power ...<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; [PE]<br/>&gt;&gt; Low loudness.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt;   * Why is the distinction important here?</p><p>Because the nonlinearity of the response happens in the ear, so what<br/>matters is how loud the sound is when it reaches the ear, not its<br/>power at the source.</p><p>&gt; [PE]<br/>&gt;&gt; Bill Sethares, in his book, claims that combinational<br/>&gt;&gt; tones are irrelevant to music and tuning because they are too quiet<br/>&gt;&gt; to matter at normal music listening levels. I think he needs<br/>&gt;&gt; to &quot;temper&quot; this assessment somewhat.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt;   * They&apos;d make ALL the difference if you&apos;re trying to achieve<br/>&gt;&gt;      a totally inharmonic spectrum!</p><p>Bill Sethares seems to disagree. His book is all about<br/>consonance/dissonance and making music with *inharmonic spectra* and<br/>he completely dismisses the relevance of combinational tones to this<br/>enterprise.</p><p>&gt;&gt; [PE]<br/>&gt;&gt; The exact frequency ratios, over the entire spectrum of audible<br/>&gt;&gt; absolute frequencies, that are just large enough to permit two sine<br/>&gt;&gt; waves to be resolved separately, have been measured in a large body<br/>&gt;&gt; of experiments on human subjects. They vary greatly over the<br/>&gt;&gt; spectrum, but never become narrower than a whole tone (nearing it<br/>&gt;&gt; only an an optimal &quot;middle&quot; absolute frequency range). Thankfully,<br/>we<br/>&gt;&gt; rarely use a single pair of pure sine waves to make music!<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt;    * So what you&apos;re saying implies that at all audible frequencies,<br/>&gt;&gt;       we cannot hear a pair of pure sine waves differing only by a<br/>&gt;&gt;       semitone as such - our ears require that we hear them as an<br/>AM<br/>&gt;&gt;       tone at their average frequency?</p><p>We may hear aspects of both -- there&apos;s a &quot;roughness&quot; region between<br/>the &quot;beating&quot; region and the &quot;two tones&quot; region where the sound is a<br/>confused compromise between the two latter sensations. But the<br/>beating tone at the average frequency doesn&apos;t completely disappear<br/>from our hearing until the sine waves differ by at least a whole tone.</p><p>&gt;       How much does this difference vary from one individual to<br/>&gt;       another, according to the &quot;large body of experiments&quot;?</p><p>Not a lot, and the interval in question is called the &quot;critical<br/>band&quot; -- one of the most familiar, and hence well-documented,<br/>entities in psychoacoustics.
