That would not be good...<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;jP<br/>&gt;</p><p>Thanks to everyone for the deeply gratifying comments. I consider the tuning list a tough audience to please, and so am all the more honored. (The New Music Box piece was almost 17,000 words, by the way. I felt I had to write that length to do the subject justice.)</p><p>It&apos;s true that the Voice has cut me back from every week to every other week and now to once a month, and from 950 words per article to 700 and now 650. It&apos;s a drag. But in defense of &quot;our&quot; kind of music, it&apos;s not really a slam at new music. For one thing, the Voice management is convinced that classical music doesn&apos;t pull in readers, and classical critic Leighton Kerner was laid off completely. New music is still considered hipper than Beethoven or Verdi (yay! one small point for our side), and actually, my editor Richard Goldstein is a fanatical new-music fan, and buys every CD I recommend. But the music section has gotten smaller and smaller, the paper itself shrank height-wise a few years ago, and now that the paper is free and therefore advertiser-driven, advertisements command more and more space. Rock has always been king at the Voice, but I don&apos;t think I&apos;ve been particularly cut back more than anyone else at the paper. It&apos;s undeniable that the Voice is no longer the cultural arbiter it once was. If you were following rock or jazz at the Voice, you might be just as disappointed.</p><p>Plus, for those interested, I&apos;ve been compensating by writing a blog (web log) at Arts Journal called PostClassic, at <a href="http://www.artsjournal.com/postclassic/">http://www.artsjournal.com/postclassic/</a>. In two months, I&apos;ve written far more words there than I do in a year at the Voice, and I will get in tuning issues whenever possible. Plus, since the space is completely under my control, I don&apos;t have to wait for news pegs, but can write about whatever strikes my bizarrely neurotic fancy. R.I.P. Village Voice, sadly, but new music lives on the internet!</p><p>With appreciation,</p><p>Kyle</p></div><h3><a id=48329 href="#48329">ðŸ”—</a>Joseph Pehrson &#x3C;jpehrson@rcn.com&#x3E;</h3><span>11/3/2003 9:04:28 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;Jon Szanto&quot; &lt;JSZANTO@A...&gt; wrote:</p><p><a href="/tuning/topicId_48317.html#48326">/tuning/topicId_48317.html#48326</a></p><p>&gt; I don&apos;t know if this is veering into metatuning areas, but:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Joe,<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; --- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;Joseph Pehrson&quot; &lt;jpehrson@r...&gt;<br/>wrote:<br/>&gt; &gt; I notice that Kyle hasn&apos;t been in the Voice so much of late, and<br/>I&apos;m<br/>&gt; &gt; worried that it&apos;s because the Voice editors don&apos;t feel our kind<br/>of<br/>&gt; &gt; music is so &quot;relevant&quot; anymore...
