However also sometimes<br/>one can go overboard and introduce too many of them.</p><p>To give an example that may be clear for those<br/>enamoured of new terms (as I am indeed myself - I<br/>like inventing words too):</p><p>I&apos;m fond of the interval 13/8. Maybe I&apos;d like to have<br/>a new term then for a scale that has a 13/8 in it.<br/>Let&apos;s call it a tridec scale :-).</p><p>Now, maybe if I find lots of interesting and new<br/>results that particularly apply to tridec scales,<br/>or maybe make lots of music in such scales<br/>and want to be able to say which of my pieces<br/>use it, so it might be easier in my own work to<br/>refer to them as tridec scales.</p><p>If I were to write an article for a journal,<br/>either musical or mathematical, and wanted<br/>to say frequently &quot;scale with a 13/8&quot; in it,<br/>then it would be useful perhaps to<br/>abbreviate that to &quot;tridec scale&quot;<br/>just for the purposes of the article.</p><p>Howeveer, I wouldn&apos;t expect it to enter<br/>a dictionary or encyclopedia unless for<br/>some reason it really took on and became<br/>prevalent.</p><p>What is a bit strange here is that words<br/>are getting into Monz&apos;s encyclopedia<br/>that are not yet used anywhere else<br/>except in the encyclopedia, or in posts<br/>here discussing the encyclopedia.</p><p>Again, there is some precedent here.<br/>Mathematicians are very fond of inventing<br/>new terms as Genehas remarked, and it would<br/>be quite normal in a mathematical paper<br/>to define a few new terms. Perhaps most<br/>mathetmaical papers introduce a new<br/>term or so, so think how many mathematical<br/>terms have been invented. But most get<br/>forgotten quickly.</p><p>Normally, they are only used<br/>in that paper, and in some of the<br/>subsequent papers that refer to it.<br/>If it is a one off paper that never<br/>gets any follow up, by other researchers,<br/>its terms may be published once only,<br/>though they may have been in frequent use<br/>for a few years by the researcher who wrote<br/>the paper and those who discussed its<br/>results with him.</p><p>That then is the usual way new terms<br/>are introduced into general mathematical<br/>practice - someone uses a term<br/>a few times maybe in a talk or in a<br/>paper - then it gets picked<br/>up by others, and eventually if the<br/>idea is one of wide relevance to other<br/>researchers, then it may become the<br/>established notation in the field.</p><p>E.g. the term n-grid dual which I needed<br/>a lot in my geometrical research was<br/>invented by De Bruin in his paper on<br/>the subject introducing the construction<br/>- and now is a widely understood term<br/>in non periodic tiling research.<br/>You wouldn&apos;t think of calling that<br/>construction by any other name now.</p><p>But in its early days you would need to<br/>give a reference to his paper and<br/>probably you would briefly recap the<br/>definition so that the reader knows what<br/>you are talking about, and so that they<br/>know where to go to look it up if anything<br/>isn&apos;t clear about how you are using it.</p><p>So the thing that is a bit strange is that<br/>some of the material in the encyclpedia is<br/>presented in the form of leading edge research.</p><p>If it were restricted to use only terms<br/>that are currently used in say, at least<br/>half a dozen tuning posts, and posts not discussing<br/>the inclusion of the term in the dictionary,<br/>ones actually using the term to discuss other<br/>things of practical or theoretical interest,<br/>then the number of new words would be considerably<br/>reduced.</p><p>I think that would make it more accessible<br/>to newbies and more generlly useful even to<br/>tuning maths denizons to judge by Dave Keenan&apos;s<br/>remarks. On the other hand it makes some entries a bit more wordy<br/>- but then quite a few entries will get removed<br/>altogether and the entire encyclopedia itself<br/>might end up being rather smaller than it<br/>is now.</p><p>Of course Monz and Paul and Gene form quite<br/>a dynamo for inventing new terms and one<br/>doesn&apos;t want to discourage that of course.<br/>Some of them may become useful in the future<br/>although not used in any posts yet.</p><p>Maybe one needs some kind of division of the<br/>encyclopedia - an encyclopedia of currently<br/>used terms and one of proposed terms<br/>for future use by tuning theorists. That division<br/>might make it easier to use.</p><p>Or even indeed, some kind of indication at the head of teh<br/>entry of whether the term is an essential one,<br/>a proposed one for future use, or a rarely<br/>used one that one may encounter now and again<br/>in some of the more recondite posts on the subject.</p><p>It would be useful for the newbie to know if the term<br/>they are learning is actually used by<br/>anyone yet, or used frequently yet.</p><p>It would also be useful for the newbie if proposed<br/>new terms weren&apos;t yet used in the rest of the<br/>encyclopedia until they become current, even if<br/>the rest of the encyclopedia becomes more wordy<br/>as a result.</p><p>One could also follow the model of dictionaries<br/>and encyclopedias and have a smaller encyclopedia<br/>for newbies. But that is too much work for someone.</p><p>However, some kind of indication of the popularity of<br/>an entry may be useful right now, particularly<br/>some indication o whether it is a proposal for<br/>a new term, or a currently popular term,<br/>or a rarely but occasionally used term.</p><p>Just a suggestion.</p><p>Robert</p></div><h3><a id=55561 href="#55561">ðŸ”—</a>monz &#x3C;monz@tonalsoft.com&#x3E;</h3><span>8/15/2004 10:24:50 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>hi Robert,</p><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;Robert Walker&quot; &lt;robertwalker@n...&gt;<br/>wrote:</p><p>&gt; Hi there,<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I can see the need for new terms.

Maybe<br/>that can help?</p><p>I don&apos;t know what the solution is quite<br/>but maybe it can help to clarify what<br/>the issue is. Often dictionaries<br/>label words as obsolete, rare etc.<br/>Might help to label the words<br/>simlarly, as rare, some are obsolete<br/>and you say that if they are. But<br/>could also be useful to label them<br/>as &quot;words for future use&quot; in whatever<br/>way one chooses to say that if you<br/>leave those in. Never heard of a<br/>&quot;Dictionary for the future&quot;, kind<br/>of a bit sci fi but I suppose one<br/>could :-).</p><p>And I do think using future words<br/>in entries that don&apos;t need them<br/>are going to be puzzling for a newbie who has<br/>enough to deal with without<br/>puzzling about learning the meaning of future<br/>words that possibly may or may not<br/>get used later on. So if one<br/>can reduce the number of uses of<br/>those in the rest of the dictionary<br/>I think it will help newbies, and even<br/>some experienced hands.</p><p>Robert</p></div><h3><a id=55592 href="#55592">ðŸ”—</a>Jacob &#x3C;jbarton@rice.edu&#x3E;</h3><span>8/16/2004 1:04:24 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>&gt; as always, i welcome contributions from anyone who<br/>&gt; may be able to provide more insight.</p><p>Hi monz!
