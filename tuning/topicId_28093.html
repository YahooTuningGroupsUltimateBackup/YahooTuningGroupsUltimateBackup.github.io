I think I might be the one here who lives<br/>the closest...?  Anyone south of Houston?  If not, then here, 1.5 miles away<br/>or so, I have to say it was surreal.</p><p>This was otherwise one of the bluest clearest days with low humidity that<br/>we&apos;ve had all summer.  This is what observatories call good visibility.  And<br/>here we were with our unused City Fun Passes, figuring that once the rain<br/>let up we&apos;d go do something today.  Luckily we were too exhausted after<br/>karate class early morning to consider using one of the only three tickets<br/>we had left: the observation deck of the World Trade Center.</p><p>Someone would have said hey there&apos;s a plane coming.  I would have said oh<br/>come on it&apos;s a hologram!  Why do you think they charge 10 bucks... and I<br/>would have been hit in the head with a 727.</p><p>I&apos;m not going to colour the hindsight for dramatic purposes.  I didn&apos;t come<br/>within breaths and minutes of being there, but it was definitely on tap and<br/>it actually could have happened.  We actually were planning on getting there<br/>within the next week or two.  Today would have been a great day for it.<br/>Just the possibility I could have been there, I don&apos;t know.  It&apos;s messing<br/>with me.</p><p>Otherwise sorry we haven&apos;t posted.  Haven&apos;t been too well.<br/>I had a massive experience today.  Might post it to one list or another<br/>before too long.</p><p>Marc</p></div>
