I should mention Carl, I mean as &quot;fully integrated&quot; into the<br/>&gt;program.  In other words, they have a &quot;keypad&quot; that looks just like<br/>&gt;the numeric keypad on a computer keyboard on the screen.  It has the<br/>&gt;*quartertones* right on it.  I suppose they could add yet *another*<br/>&gt;keypad template that would have *lots* of different microtones, but I<br/>&gt;think that would be asking a lot more for them to do that then to add<br/>&gt;just a couple &quot;fully implemented&quot; ones.</p><p>In a scheme like David B. had in mind, I would imagine the user would<br/>be able to put whatever accidentals he wanted on the keypad.</p><p>jp wrote...<br/>&gt;&gt; Do you mean you&apos;re also asking for playback?  They don&apos;t support<br/>&gt;&gt; playback for quartertones right now, AFAIK.  If they do, I&apos;ll be<br/>&gt;&gt; very happy today indeed!<br/>&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt; -Carl<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;****Yes, playback for quartertones *is* supported, although I haven&apos;t<br/>&gt;gotten it to work as yet.  I hope it works on my soundcard.<br/>//<br/>&gt;And, I just got a message today from them suggesting that you can<br/>&gt;adjust playback with the quartertone plug-in that will playback *any*<br/>&gt;correct microtone, and, of course, you can add whatever graphic you<br/>&gt;want as a microtonal symbol, even creating them in a Font program, if<br/>&gt;necessary.<br/>//<br/>&gt;Well, I received the following quick response on the Sibelius &quot;chat&quot;<br/>&gt;line:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;You can easily add as many symbols as you like and then use a plug-in<br/>&gt;to get the correct playback -- this is, after all, how Sibelius<br/>&gt;currently plays back quartertones (see File; Plug-ins; Playback &gt;<br/>&gt;Quartertone\Playback).<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;***I thought I tried this, but I obviously need to play with it some<br/>&gt;more.  Apparently they claim it&apos;s possible...</p><p>Alison wrote...<br/>&gt;I mentioned in a previous post that there is a 1/4 tone plug in which<br/>&gt;allows playback. It is totally unreliable and slides up and off the<br/>&gt;tones. But that might be a function of the software or hardware you<br/>&gt;use for playback.</p><p>I couldn&apos;t get the quartertone plugin to do anything on my laptop.<br/>I need to look at it. . .  .</p><p>I had this exchange with the Sibelius team in October...</p><p>Me...<br/>&gt;() Map MIDI channel / note numbers arbitrarily over the lines and<br/>&gt;spaces of individual staves.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;() Adjust the increment in MIDI note numbers that each accidental<br/>&gt;incurs.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;() I see I&apos;m allowed beween 1 and 5 lines per staff.  Very good,<br/>&gt;but up to 6 or 7 lines wouldn&apos;t hurt.</p><p>Bart Cummings...<br/>&gt;Thanks for writing. The answers to your midi questions are both no.<br/>&gt;We are working on this, but have no idea when this may become a<br/>&gt;feature for Sibelius. The answer to your third questions is yes, you<br/>&gt;can do this by going to Create-Staff Type Change-New and then typing<br/>&gt;in the number of staff lines you require.</p><p>-Carl</p></div>
