Still use &quot;sk&quot; to mean<br/>&gt; 2^(1/612), though.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; how do you pronounce &quot;schism&quot;? like &quot;shism&quot;? naah . . .<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Usage Note: The word schism, which was originally spelled<br/>&gt; scisme in English, is traditionally pronounced (szm).<br/>&gt; However, in the 16th century the word was respelled with<br/>&gt; an initial sch in order to conform to its Latin and Greek<br/>&gt; forms. From this spelling arose the pronunciation (skzm).<br/>&gt; Long regarded as incorrect, it became so common in both<br/>&gt; British and American English that it gained acceptability<br/>&gt; as a standard variant. Evidence indicates, however, that<br/>&gt; it is now the preferred pronunciation, at least in American<br/>&gt; English. In a recent survey 61 percent of the Usage Panel<br/>&gt; indicated that they use (skzm), while 31 percent said they<br/>&gt; use (szm). A smaller number, 8 percent, preferred a third<br/>&gt; pronunciation, (shzm).</p><p>thanks for that note, Gene ... with my penchant for history,<br/>i found it very interesting.  here&apos;s a little history on<br/>the musical use of the terms &quot;schisma&quot; and &quot;skhisma&quot;:</p><p>the earliest reference i know of is in Boethus, _De institutione<br/>musica, liber III_; here&apos;s Freidlin&apos;s text of the original:<br/><a href="http://www.music.indiana.edu/tml/6th-8th/BOEMUS3_TEXT.html">http://www.music.indiana.edu/tml/6th-8th/BOEMUS3_TEXT.html</a></p><p>&gt;&gt; De minoribus semitonio intervallis.<br/>&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt; VIII.

Augustinian teaching that<br/>&gt;&gt; justified the use of torture and death as legal instruments<br/>&gt;&gt; to be used by the Church to convert the heretic became<br/>&gt;&gt; widely accepted. This acted as a prelude to the legitimisation<br/>&gt;&gt; of the Inquisition, which was to receive papal approval<br/>&gt;&gt; under Gregory IX in 1233. Heresy was to be punished for<br/>&gt;&gt; the spiritual &quot;good&quot; of the individual as well as for the<br/>&gt;&gt; preservation and enhancement of the status of the Church<br/>&gt;&gt; and State - an attitude and mentality equally accepted<br/>&gt;&gt; by future Western reformers such as Calvin and Luther.<br/>&gt;&gt; Such was to be the patrimony and inheritance of the Crusades.<br/>&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt; An even darker shadow was cast over Innocent&apos;s pontificate<br/>&gt;&gt; by his involvement in the Fourth Crusade, which led to<br/>&gt;&gt; schism between Eastern and Western Christendom in the<br/>&gt;&gt; eleventh century, an event which is one of the greatest<br/>&gt;&gt; calamities in the history of the Church. The main aim of<br/>&gt;&gt; the Crusades was to try to free the Holy Land from the<br/>&gt;&gt; Seljuk Turks who had conquered Jerusalem in 1071. This<br/>&gt;&gt; was not accomplished, but rather in its consequences it<br/>&gt;&gt; seriously undermined the powers of resistance of the<br/>&gt;&gt; Christian East to the advance of Islam. It also encouraged<br/>&gt;&gt; the excessive growth of papal power in the West, and this<br/>&gt;&gt; over-centralisation of Church government resulted in many<br/>&gt;&gt; abuses and provoked widespread discontent. Thus the<br/>&gt;&gt; Reformation itself, which split the West into two hostile<br/>&gt;&gt; camps, was one of its results flowing from the split<br/>&gt;&gt; between East and West<br/>&gt;&gt; ...<br/>&gt;&gt; Roman Catholics have accused the East of an obstinate<br/>&gt;&gt; refusal to accept the leadership of the Pope, and of<br/>&gt;&gt; undue submissiveness towards the secular power. The Orthodox,<br/>&gt;&gt; in return, have hurled against Western Christians charges<br/>&gt;&gt; of arrogance and pride, and have insisted that both Latins<br/>&gt;&gt; and Protestants have wilfully departed from the sound<br/>&gt;&gt; tradition of the early Church and perverted their religion<br/>&gt;&gt; by arbitrary and harmful innovations.<br/>&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt; Many controversial books have been written on this subject;<br/>&gt;&gt; but if the simple question is asked, &quot;What was the cause of<br/>&gt;&gt; the Schism between Rome and Constantinople, and when exactly<br/>&gt;&gt; did it occur?&quot;, too often no clear answer is forthcoming.<br/>&gt;&gt; The absence of an agreed statement on such a vital issue,<br/>&gt;&gt; one which has so profoundly and so disastrously affected<br/>&gt;&gt; the life of all Christians, is puzzling indeed. Yet an<br/>&gt;&gt; explanation of it is to be found in the study of the<br/>&gt;&gt; political and ecclesiastical events which led to the break<br/>&gt;&gt; of communion between East and West.<br/>&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt; Though conflict, disagreement and tensions in politics and<br/>&gt;&gt; theological interpretation existed from the fifth century<br/>&gt;&gt; onwards, this gradual process of open hostility and bitter<br/>&gt;&gt; hate reached its climax between the ninth and thirteenth<br/>&gt;&gt; century. It is often thought that the lasting split in the<br/>&gt;&gt; Church must have been caused by some major doctrinal<br/>&gt;&gt; disagreement. The history of the schism does not confirm<br/>&gt;&gt; this opinion. The growing alienation between the Christian<br/>&gt;&gt; East and West was provoked by political competition, petty<br/>&gt;&gt; quarrels and personal rivalries. It was a slow movement;<br/>&gt;&gt; for the Church organism vigorously resited these attacks<br/>&gt;&gt; of destructive forces. The final blow to the unity of the<br/>&gt;&gt; Church was inflicted by no heresy, but by the drunken and<br/>&gt;&gt; undisciplined mob of Crusaders who sacked Constantinople<br/>&gt;&gt; in 1204 and massacred its Christian population.<br/>&gt;&gt; ...<br/>&gt;&gt; This day, April 13, 1204 marks the end of the fellowship<br/>&gt;&gt; between Eastern and Western Christians. The split was brought<br/>&gt;&gt; about, not by quarrelsome theologians or ambitious prelates,<br/>&gt;&gt; as is usually suggested, but by the greed and lust of those<br/>&gt;&gt; men who, in the name of the Prince of Peace, had embarked<br/>&gt;&gt; upon a war of aggression and conquest.</p><p>i stick with &quot;skhisma&quot; out of respect for Ellis&apos;s sensitivity<br/>in this matter, but it&apos;s necessary to note that nearly everyone<br/>else today uses the &quot;schisma&quot; spelling.</p><p>-monz</p><p>_________________________________________________________<br/>Do You Yahoo!?<br/>Get your free <a href="https://twitter.com/yahoo">@yahoo</a>.com address at <a href="http://mail.yahoo.com">http://mail.yahoo.com</a></p></div>
