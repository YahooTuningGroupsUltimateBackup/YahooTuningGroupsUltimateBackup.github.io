I guess 10 or so, going<br/>on this weekend and surrounding the weekend...</p><p>In fact, his piece today, Sunday... 3PM called _Meditation_ for<br/>electronic media is in 19-tET!  Can&apos;t make that one, though, since<br/>I&apos;m involved with a meeting of the New York Composers Circle this<br/>afternoon... (busy composer weekend!)</p><p>However, I *am* attending a tribute to the electronic music pioneer<br/>Otto Luening this evening (7 PM at the Flea Theatre... 41 White<br/>Street NYC ---take the #1 train to Franklin...)  Otto was very<br/>instrumental in our composer&apos;s group, the Composers Concordance and<br/>could also be considered a microtonalist through his advocacy of just<br/>intonation, or at least the emulation of just intonation overtone<br/>structures in the 12-tET confines...</p><p>Last night&apos;s performance of microtonalist John Eaton&apos;s _El Dinino<br/>Narciso_ was, indeed divine!  This was also on the same American<br/>Composers Alliance series.  John considers it one of his best chamber<br/>pieces, and I certainly would agree.</p><p>There is hardly one 12-tET pitch in the entire thing...!  outside of<br/>the playing of the pitched percussion.  There is *lots* of<br/>percussion, lots of wild-interval singing by the protagonists, and<br/>many special echo effects, for the soloist who represents the<br/>god &quot;Echo&quot;... fittingly enough.</p><p>This is a *very* complex piece, and I got to look at the score<br/>afterward.  Meters constantly shifting, pitches all over the place,<br/>most of them microtonal...  dramatic effects, electronic and vocal.</p><p>Despite the complexity, the piece was *very* engaging and dramatic.<br/>Lots of stuff going on, that&apos;s for sure!</p><p>Joseph Pehrson</p></div><h3>Gene Ward Smith &#x3C;gwsmith@svpal.org&#x3E;</h3><span>6/12/2005 12:13:39 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;Joseph Pehrson&quot; &lt;jpehrson@r...&gt; wrote:<br/>Otto was very<br/>&gt; instrumental in our composer&apos;s group, the Composers Concordance and<br/>&gt; could also be considered a microtonalist through his advocacy of just<br/>&gt; intonation, or at least the emulation of just intonation overtone<br/>&gt; structures in the 12-tET confines...</p><p>What in the world does that mean?</p></div><h3>Joseph Pehrson &#x3C;jpehrson@rcn.com&#x3E;</h3><span>6/12/2005 7:57:48 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;Gene Ward Smith&quot; &lt;gwsmith@s...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt; --- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;Joseph Pehrson&quot; &lt;jpehrson@r...&gt;<br/>wrote:<br/>&gt; Otto was very<br/>&gt; &gt; instrumental in our composer&apos;s group, the Composers Concordance<br/>and<br/>&gt; &gt; could also be considered a microtonalist through his advocacy of<br/>just<br/>&gt; &gt; intonation, or at least the emulation of just intonation overtone<br/>&gt; &gt; structures in the 12-tET confines...<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; What in the world does that mean?</p><p>***Hi Gene,</p><p>Well, essentially, Otto would emulate the chord spacing of the<br/>overtone<br/>series, but would use the nearest pitch in 12-equal to do it...<br/>Maybe<br/>a little &quot;hokey,&quot; but at least he was trying to get at the physical<br/>overtones of the acoustical nature of music...  He did that in the<br/>piece for bassoon and piano that was played tonight at the ACA<br/>concert<br/>in his honor...</p><p>J. Pehrson</p></div>
