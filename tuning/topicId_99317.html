Many of these temperaments don&apos;t seem to immediately fit<br/>into any family, or if they do I don&apos;t see it. Others are generated by<br/>other methods, such as the (81/80)^n = 25/24 temperaments I just<br/>posted about, so I&apos;m not sure if they&apos;d end up fitting in a family at<br/>all. In general, these temperaments don&apos;t end up fitting in a page on<br/>the wiki. So I&apos;ve created a temperament orphanage</p><p><a href="http://xenharmonic.wikispaces.com/TemperamentOrphanage">http://xenharmonic.wikispaces.com/TemperamentOrphanage</a></p><p>This can be the place for people to document useful temperaments<br/>temporarily when no obvious family arises. If a temperament stays in<br/>the orphanage for too long, then it might be best to just create a new<br/>family for it. If you see a temperament on this page and know what<br/>family it fits into, then go ahead and move it.</p><p>-Mike</p></div>
