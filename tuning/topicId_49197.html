I will try to respond anyway. Please alert me if this is a non-answer to your question.</p><p>When I synthesize a waveform with a pre-determined fundamental that simulates the harmonic content of the musical sound coming out of a Turkish instrument, I am hoping I will be able to determine how faithfully my pitch tracking system senses the fundamental frequency in a test sound.</p><p>(2) I am envisioning conducting two tests. One test will involve taking many readings from the same test sound and looking at the coefficient of variation in the data acquired. This procedure will be repeated at various pitch levels within the range of the instrument. I am hoping the spread in the raw data thus obtained will give me a measure of accuaracy of the system.</p><p>Another test will involve feeding two sounds into the system - one sound at a time - with fundamentals that are very close and narrowing down the difference between the fundamentals until the system can no longer detect the difference between the two test sounds. This test should give me a measure of the resolution of the system.</p><p>Can Akkoc</p><p>Can Akkoc</p><p><a href="mailto:can193849@yahoo.com">can193849@yahoo.com</a></p><p>---------------------------------<br/>Do you Yahoo!?<br/>New Yahoo!
