The difference<br/>between E- and Eb+ is 25/24, so this means that (81/80)^3 = 25/24 in<br/>the system. I just double checked - the difference between these is in<br/>fact 1600000/1594323.

This seems ridiculous, but<br/>it&apos;s not too bad if you know how to modulate by 81/80 and also that<br/>you just need 4 of those modulations to get you to a nicely manageable<br/>25/24.

How in the heck did you figure this chord progression out?<br/>It was a terribly time-consuming process but it was, nevertheless, in perfect accordance with my earlier concept of breaking the factor into powers of two other factors. This is the second approach I mention in my &quot;almost finished&quot; article. So you can either do it using the generator &quot;switching&quot; algorithm, which is &quot;the first approach&quot;, or you can use the one which I&apos;ll now describe.</p><p>If we use octave equivalents of 3/1 and 5/1, then the exponents come out as -13 and 5 (I&apos;m omitting the exponent for the prime 2, which would be 9). If we use octave equivalents of 3/1 and 5/3, then they&apos;re -8 and 5. If we use octave equivalents of 5/3 and 5/1, then they&apos;re 13 and -8, which is what we&apos;ll go for because we want to use major/minor triads for the whole thing -- i.e. we&apos;ll go for the version with the highest absolute values. This means that (5/24)^13 * (64/5)^8 = 1600000/1594323. Now, similarly to assigning things like &quot;a=9/8, b=256/243&quot; and multipliing &quot;aabaaab&quot; to get C major in Pythagorean, you can assign &quot;a=5/24, b=64/5&quot;, then multiply &quot;abaababaababaabaababa&quot;, and you get 1600000/1594323 (if you replace &quot;a&quot; and &quot;b&quot; with &quot;1&quot; and &quot;2&quot;, respectively, you can try it in Scala with the Mode/create command). If you save both the non-reduced and the octave-reduced version of this, this allows you to make an amity drift in pure JI. If you, instead of that, raise each consecutive pitch by the 21th root of 1600000/1594323, you end up where you started, which is what I did.</p><p>&gt; 2) Porcupine makes (81/80)^1 out to be equal to 25/24, and Amity makes<br/>&gt; (81/80)^3 out to be equal to 25/24.

Do you think some analog of the above progressions could be<br/>&gt; constructed for Porcupine or Tetracot?</p><p>Well, all three of them share the 10/9-style phrases, which you can hear yourself in my older examples.</p><p>&gt; In general I&apos;m trying to figure out how to turn the issue of &quot;solving&quot;<br/>&gt; comma pumps into generalized &quot;lego blocks&quot; that you can put in any<br/>&gt; tuning.

That is very cool. Is this abaababaababaabaababa pattern<br/>&gt; the Amity MOS or something?</p><p>Well, the answer is a bit complicated. A 21-tone chain of amity generators doesn&apos;t make a MOS. However, a 21-tone scale of a^13*b^8 does make a MOS if both &quot;a&quot; and &quot;b&quot; are rising or if both are falling. In that case, the generator is either a^5*b^3 or a^8*b^5. But in our case, one is falling, one is rising, and if you divide both of these by the 21st root of 1600000/1594323 (i.e. one gets wider and the other gets narrower), you get -- guess what -- not a MOS but an equal scale of amity generators, only listed in non-monotonic order; and a &quot;zero cent&quot; value instead of a period. -- And the figures like a^5*b^3 or a^8*b^5 then give you a single generator, rising or falling.</p><p>&gt; Also, is the &quot;almost finished article&quot; the<br/>&gt; one you sent me offlist?</p><p>Exactly.</p><p>&gt; What is &quot;marvo?&quot; I decided to call it &quot;gravity&quot; after amity because<br/>&gt; the generator is a &quot;grave&quot; perfect fifth.</p><p>I&apos;m not sure myself. I think Gene understood it as a 7-limit 2D temperament -- maybe he could enlighten us. And I&apos;m also not sure whether he means to use the name &quot;marvo&quot; for the 7-limit one or for the 5-limit one as well. The Xenwiki lists marvo using an an acute fourth as the generator and maps the 7/1 to, for goodness sake, &quot;-17, 46&quot;! More here:<br/><a href="http://xenharmonic.wikispaces.com/Proposed+names+for+rank+2+temperaments">http://xenharmonic.wikispaces.com/Proposed+names+for+rank+2+temperaments</a></p><p>&gt; 1) Find the minimal comma pump<br/>&gt; 2) Break it down into motions by 3/2 and 5/4. Call motion by 3/2 a,<br/>&gt; and motion by 5/4 b</p><p>Or better yet, 3/1 and 5/1. This is what I get by finding the prime exponents of the vanishing interval (omitting the prime 2). But having found these, I then have to compare the exponent values after changing one of the two approximants to 5/3, therefore I get three pairs of exponent values and go for the one which uses the highest absolute values of them all.</p><p>Having done that, I then have to add or subtract the appropriate amount of octaves to each interval. So for amity, for example, let&apos;s see what the code would have to do in full detail.</p><p>The initial exponents are &quot;9, -13, 5&quot;.</p><p>After some comparison, we find that the best way is to replace 3/1 with 5/3, which gives us new &quot;source&quot; exponents of &quot;9, 13, -8&quot;.</p><p>Now, we break this into two pairs of numbers in such a way that their pparticular multiples add up to &quot;9, 13, -8&quot;. So the target exponents for &quot;a&quot; will be &quot;-3, 1, 0&quot; and the target exponents for &quot;b&quot; will be &quot;-6, 0, 1&quot;, which means that a = 5/24 and b = 5/64, therefore a^13*b^(-8) gives us the same as 1600000/1594323. This is the most important step of all --  describing the interval by two exponents instead of three.</p><p>Then, if any of the source exponents is negative, we invert the factor which uses that particular exponent to make the progression possible with positive powers of &quot;a&quot; and &quot;b&quot;. For this example, we invert &quot;b&quot;, so we have a = 5/24, b = 64/5, and our &quot;modified&quot; exponents are the absolute values of the source ones.</p><p>Now, these modified exponents add up to 21 (again, omitting prime 2), which means that the whole thing spans a total of 20 generators and that the 21st tone represents the vanishing interval. So finally, the factor which you&apos;ve inverted is multiplied by the 21st root of the vanishing interval, while the unchanged one is divided by that.</p><p>From this moment on, you know the generator counts for &quot;a&quot; and &quot;b&quot; by reversing the order of the source exponents and, if necessary (in case they&apos;re both of the same sign), changing the sign in one of these (I personally prefer changing the one on the &quot;resulting right-hand side&quot; --  i.e. the one in the middle of the three original ones). For example, you can say that &quot;a&quot; takes -8 generators and &quot;b&quot; takes 13 generators in amity (same sign as the source), while &quot;a&quot; takes 7 generators and &quot;b&quot; takes -10 generators in orwell (the three source exponents are &quot;-21, 10, 7&quot;). For split-octave periods, you still have to divide by the GCD of the two, otherwise you&apos;re getting counts for a full octave rather than for one period -- i.e. including the repetition.</p><p>&gt; 3) Distribute a and b evenly; e.g. if the pattern to get you to the<br/>&gt; pump is aaaaabb, make it aabaaab instead. So in other words, find the<br/>&gt; &quot;MOS&quot; arrangement for it</p><p>That&apos;s one solution -- the more straightforward one. Another is the one I used in my article -- i.e. if I already know that an octave equivalent of 5/3 takes -8 generators and that an octave equivalent of 1/5 takes 13 generators (that&apos;s the one I&apos;ve inverted), this also tells me that the tonic major triad occupies generators -13 to 0 (namely 0, -5, -13) and that I should start with generator number -5 to get this triad (i.e. begin with an octave equivalent of 3/1, then comes a step of -8 generators which gives -13, then comes a step of +13 which gives 0). Since the total generator span is 20 and I wish to go away from the tonic range about the same amount in both directions, I can choose, for example, a range like -16 to +4, start with -5, and then just alternate steps of 13 and -8 generators in such a way that keeps me in that range.</p><p>&gt; 4) Every time you have an adjacent +3/2 and -5/4 right next to one<br/>&gt; another, condense it into a +6/5 instead</p><p>I don&apos;t understand the use of this. You can make a meantone pump like &quot;C A D G C&quot; but there isn&apos;t a single triad. You can make a meantone pump like &quot;C E A D G C&quot; but this only gives you C major and A minor, followed by a D with no third or sixth available. But you can make a meantone pump like &quot;C A F D B G E C&quot; which is the shortest possible pump with major/minor triads.</p><p>&gt; That should give you a fairly &quot;even&quot; route from point A to point B. Or<br/>&gt; if you want to stick to generators as you said, rather than breaking<br/>&gt; the root movements down into 3/2 and 5/4 directly, break them down<br/>&gt; into generator movements (so 10/9 if you&apos;re in porcupine, etc).</p><p>Well, you&apos;d have to find the source exponents anyway so that doesn&apos;t change a lot on the algorithm.</p><p>My goodness, this is getting long again. :-D</p><p>Petr</p></div><h3>genewardsmith &#x3C;genewardsmith@...&#x3E;</h3><span>5/20/2011 11:57:52 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, Petr Pa&angst;&Atilde;&shy;zek &lt;petrparizek2000@...&gt; wrote:</p><p>&gt; &gt; What is &quot;marvo?&quot; I decided to call it &quot;gravity&quot; after amity because<br/>&gt; &gt; the generator is a &quot;grave&quot; perfect fifth.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I&apos;m not sure myself.

I&apos;ll need to<br/>take some time to reorganize this.</p><p>Maybe a good thing to do would be to find the &quot;minimum length comma<br/>pump&quot; for any temperament as represented in 5/4&apos;s, 3/2&apos;s, and 6/5&apos;s.<br/>That should be easy to do. Then we&apos;ll know how temperaments like<br/>&quot;marvo&quot; above, which I think I called &quot;gravity,&quot; really do end up<br/>comparing with things like magic and such. If a huge comma like<br/>129140163/128000000 just ends up leading to a 10-chord comma pump or<br/>something, that might not be a bad thing at all, and makes more sense<br/>than looking at the periodicity block size and so on.

But since I decided to find exponents which have the highest possible absolute values, I can start thinking about root movements after knowing the progression of dyads before applying it to the triads, if you know what I mean -- i.e. the &quot;(10/3)^4 * (1/5)^3&quot; tells me that an octave equivalent of a falling minor third occurs 4 times and that an octave equivalent of a falling major third occurs 3 times. Once I know this, I can choose what order I want to have them in. For example, if I start on C and do &quot;abababa&quot;, I get &quot;C, A, F, D, Bb, G, Eb, C&quot;. In contrast, if I start on G and do &quot;ababaab&quot;, I get &quot;G, E, C, A, F, D, B, G&quot;, which is my preferred solution (see my article for more explanation). These are not root movements, these are successive common dyads -- and you can do whatever you want to turn them into triads -- i.e. &quot;C major, A minor, D minor, G major&quot; or &quot;A minor 7, D minor 7, G major (triad)&quot; have different root movements and it&apos;s a different number of chords, but the progression of dyads is still the same -- i.e. &quot;ababaab&quot; starting on G.
