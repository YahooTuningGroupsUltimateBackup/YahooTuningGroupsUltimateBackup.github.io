However, a<br/>few issues have cropped up.</p><p>First, there do exist historical temperaments intermediate between<br/>1/5 comma meantone and 12-ET - so if you reject one you are not<br/>forced to take up the other. In fact, according to what I understand<br/>of what is in Jorgensen for the early and mid-19th century in middle-<br/>Europe, typical piano tuning methods combined some pure 5ths with<br/>some mildly tempered ones which typically form some meantone series<br/>with say 1/7 comma. The result was fairly close to ET but perhaps<br/>noticeably different, and was often *called* equal.</p><p>(Copies of Jorgensen seem to be extremely hard to obtain on this side<br/>of the Atlantic, by the way.)</p><p>Second, we can&apos;t assume what Wagner&apos;s intention was with respect to<br/>if the chord was supposed to be &apos;nice&apos; or &apos;nasty&apos;. He certainly once<br/>had a reputation for &apos;nasty&apos; sounds. The Tristan chord was felt to be<br/>not exactly nasty, but certainly disorienting.</p><p>Third, how far can orchestral tuning have deviated from the not-quite-<br/>equal-tempered piano, when piano concertos were an extremely popular<br/>genre and Liszt wrote many transcriptions of orchestral pieces?</p><p>Fourth, remember that Mahler said that the musical world *had*<br/>discarded the distinctive features of earlier meantone tunings in<br/>favour of ET: he was presumably referring to the later 19th century.<br/>I cannot think he would say this if he had not been brought up with<br/>equal or near-equal as the norm.</p><p>Last, and slightly tangentially, what about the augmented triad in<br/>near-equal temperament? It is made up of three major 3rds each of<br/>which is accepted to be a consonant interval, therefore it should be<br/>a concord. But it is always treated in theory as a discord. I claim<br/>that this is because it is unstable and ambiguous, being equally at<br/>home in three different, mutually remote tonalities. This is part of<br/>my argument about the Tristan chord, that it is properly at home in a<br/>tonality of D sharp which is maximally remote from A.</p><p>~~~T~~~</p></div><h3><a id=58427 href="#58427">ðŸ”—</a>Carl Lumma &#x3C;ekin@lumma.org&#x3E;</h3><span>5/1/2005 8:27:21 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>&gt;First, there do exist historical temperaments intermediate between<br/>&gt;1/5 comma meantone and 12-ET - so if you reject one you are not<br/>&gt;forced to take up the other.
