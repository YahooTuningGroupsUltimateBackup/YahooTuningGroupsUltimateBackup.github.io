Most commonly, two tetrachords are put together<br/>to make a 7-tone scale, with one rooted on 1/1 and the other<br/>rooted on 3/2.  Though sometimes the upper tetrachord is rooted<br/>on 4/3 and the 9/8 gap is left on top as you suggest.  And all<br/>other manner of things are sometimes done.</p><p>&gt; Interesting, so &quot;that&apos;s all it is&quot;.  Then again it seems<br/>&gt; increasingly apparent to me...the more you can ultimately<br/>&gt; simplify a scales formulaic composition (no matter how many<br/>&gt; steps that simplification takes), the more natural it sounds.</p><p>I think there are two primary kinds of simplicity worth<br/>mentioning when it comes to scales:</p><p>There&apos;s something about the number of total number of intervals<br/>in a scale.  Usually one can just look at all the 2nds of the<br/>scale (e.g. 9/8 10/9 etc.) and get a good idea of the total<br/>number of unique intervals.  A scale with only one kind of 2nd<br/>can only have one kind of anything else (is an ET).  With two<br/>kinds of 2nd the order matters; LsLsLs... gives only 2 kinds<br/>of 3rd, 4th, 5th, etc. but LLssLLss gives three kinds of 3rd<br/>(2L, L+s, and 2s).</p><p>Scales with a lower number of intervals seem to me to have a<br/>more &quot;coherent&quot; sound, for lack of a better word.  Others have<br/>noticed something similar... they seem to be more singable.<br/>On the other hand, having a high number of different intervals<br/>(like many JI scales) also gives a unique sound that is<br/>certainly valid material for music-making.</p><p>The second kind of simplicity has to do with symmetry at the<br/>3/2.  Octave-equivalent scales are fully &quot;closed&quot; at the<br/>octave.  This means that if you sing a note an octave away<br/>from a pitch in the scale you&apos;ll wind up on another pitch in<br/>the scale.  There&apos;s some evidence that a similar effect may<br/>be important for the next most powerful consonance after<br/>the octave, the 3/2.  But no scale can be fully &quot;closed&quot; with<br/>respect to both the octave and the 3/2 (this is equivalent<br/>to some number of stacked fifths equally some number of<br/>octaves, which we know is impossible).  So octaves get<br/>preference, and then we try to do as best we can with 3/2s.<br/>A Pythagorean chain will be optimal here.  After that, using<br/>tetrachordal construction will give the best results.</p><p>&gt; &nbsp;&nbsp; I also wonder how Wilson&apos;s horogram scales work relative<br/>&gt; to these concepts and what they add...as, so far, they are by<br/>&gt; far the most &quot;concordant&quot; scales I have heard, more so than<br/>&gt; the MOS scales or virtually any of the others.</p><p>Er, well the horograms show MOS scales.  :)  It&apos;s just a way<br/>of visualizing MOS.</p><p>-Carl</p></div>
