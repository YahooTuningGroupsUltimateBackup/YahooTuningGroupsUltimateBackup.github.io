It is like<br/>a leap from 2-D to 3-D graphics: we are in a new and rich universe of<br/>vertical combinations and progressions.</p><p>Here it seems to me that practice is definitely in the lead, with a<br/>theory of multivoice sonorities following about a century later, with<br/>Johannes de Grocheio, Coussemaker&apos;s Anonymous I, and Jacobus of Liege<br/>in the epoch around 1300.</p><p>While part of this thread concerns following or breaking the rules,<br/>sometimes composers such as Guillaume de Machaut may be in the<br/>position of _choosing_ between different sets of rules, at times<br/>picking and choosing so as to indulge in liberties which any single<br/>set of rules might exclude.</p><p>For example, Machaut seems to have a penchant both for traditional<br/>13th-century liberties with major seconds or ninths and minor sevenths<br/>(e.g. Jacobus, who describes these intervals as partial &quot;concords&quot;),<br/>and for the new 14th-century leanings toward more emphasis on thirds<br/>and sixths (e.g. Johannes de Muris or a student reporting his<br/>teachings).</p><p>Machaut himself refers to his style as a &quot;new forge,&quot; maybe suggesting<br/>this kind of free and creative synthesis.</p><p>We could also look at the development of polyphonic forms such as the<br/>ballade, virelai (or Italian ballata), and rondeau. There wasn&apos;t, to<br/>my knowledge, any handbook available in the later 13th century to tell<br/>Adam de la Halle how to write a three-voice rondeau, or in the 14th<br/>century to tell Machaut how to arrange his cadences. Practice<br/>developed its own logic, its own organizational plans.</p><p>Maybe one analogy would be to compare theory to a map or compass, and<br/>practice to the actual landscape or terrain -- with the important<br/>amendment that this musical &quot;terrain&quot; is changing even as one attempts<br/>to describe it.</p><p>Thank you, Paul, for making a point which can&apos;t be overemphasized.</p><p>As a medievalist, I often want to express my view that medieval<br/>theorists are valuable sources of information -- as valuable as<br/>theorists of later eras. However, I certainly would not wish to claim<br/>that they are somehow more able to sum up or predict musical practice<br/>than theorists of later eras; the limitations of theory, and sovereign<br/>liberties of practice, seem to unite all eras of Western European<br/>music, and maybe the musics of various world traditions.</p><p>Most appreciatively,</p><p>Margo Schulter<br/><a href="mailto:mschulter@value.net">mschulter@value.net</a></p></div>
