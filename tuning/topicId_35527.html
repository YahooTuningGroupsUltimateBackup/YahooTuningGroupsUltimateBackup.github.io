However, in practical terms they had a hard time<br/>&gt; dealing with rational numbers, much less irrational ones.</p><p>very good point, Gene.  it should be mentioned that a big<br/>part of the reason why ancient people (except for the<br/>Sumerians and Babylonians) had such difficulty in dealing<br/>with math computations involving anything other than integers,<br/>is because of their cumbersome numerical notation.</p><p>everyone here is familiar with Roman numerals.  the ancient<br/>Greek and Hebrew numeral systems worked in a similar way,<br/>something that we (in hindsight today) can see as a sort<br/>of mixture of the way Roman and Arabic numerals work.</p><p>just for completeness, here&apos;s a quick recap of Roman numerals:</p><p>   1  I<br/>   5  V<br/>  10  X<br/>  50  L<br/> 100  C<br/> 500  D<br/>1000  M</p><p>symbols are simply added together, and individual symbols<br/>are repeated as necessary until the next symbol is reached,<br/>thus:</p><p>   2  II<br/>   3  III<br/>   4  IIII</p><p>   6  VI<br/>   7  VII<br/>   8  VIII<br/>   9  VIIII</p><p>etc.</p><p>a much later development, from medieval times, was<br/>to eliminate the four-fold repetition of digits by<br/>using subtraction from the next higher symbol for<br/>any number which would contain them, thus:</p><p>          old        new</p><p>   4  =  IIII        IV<br/>   9  =  VIIII       IX<br/>  14  =  XIIII       XIV<br/>  19  =  XVIIII      XIX<br/>  99  =  LXXXXVIIII  XCIX</p><p>so that whenever larger digits follow smaller ones,<br/>subtraction of those two instead of addition is indicated.</p><p>the Greeks had two numerical systems: acrophonic and<br/>alphabetic.  the acrophonic system was older, and very<br/>similar to the Roman system ... even a bit simpler,<br/>using distinct symbols to represent only</p><p>     1  I  iota<br/>     5  P  pi<br/>    10  D  delta<br/>   100  H  eta<br/> 1,000  X  xi<br/>10,000  M  mu</p><p>(of course, &quot;pi&quot; and &quot;delta&quot; should look different...<br/>these are the Roman ASCII equivalents.  also note that<br/>&quot;gamma&quot; came to be used for 5 instead of &quot;pi&quot;, probably<br/>because of similiarity of appearance.)</p><p>the top diagram here gives a good explanation:<br/><a href="http://www.clas.ufl.edu/users/rhatch/HIS-SCI-STUDY-GUIDE/0025_ancientGreekNu">http://www.clas.ufl.edu/users/rhatch/HIS-SCI-STUDY-GUIDE/0025_ancientGreekNu</a><br/>merals.html</p><p>the Greek alphabetic system used the 24 letters of the<br/>Phoenician alphabet -- which became the regular Greek<br/>alphabet -- plus 3 auxilliary letters (digamma, koppi,<br/>sampi) to represent numbers.</p><p>in Greek, the first 9 letters of the alphabet, usually<br/>(but not always) with a stroke mark after the letter,<br/>represent the digits 0...9, then the next 9<br/>letters[-plus-stroke] represent the tens from 10...90,<br/>then then next 9 letters[-plus-stroke] represent the<br/>hundreds 100...900  :</p><p>  1  alpha<br/>  2  beta<br/>  3  gamma<br/>  4  delta<br/>  5  epsilon<br/>  6  digamma<br/>  7  zeta<br/>  8  eta<br/>  9  theta</p><p> 10  iota<br/> 20  kappa<br/> 30  lambda<br/> 40  mu<br/> 50  nu<br/> 60  xi<br/> 70  omicron<br/> 80  pi<br/> 90  koppa</p><p>100  rho<br/>200  sigma<br/>300  tau<br/>400  upsilon<br/>500  phi<br/>600  chi<br/>700  psi<br/>800  omega<br/>900  sampi</p><p>then by putting a stroke mark *before* rather than after<br/>the letter, each of these would be multiplied by 1,000.<br/>for these larger numbers the stroke-mark is obviously<br/>mandatory.  see:<br/><a href="http://mkatz.web.wesleyan.edu/grk202/vocabulary/greek_numerals.html">http://mkatz.web.wesleyan.edu/grk202/vocabulary/greek_numerals.html</a></p><p>(and note that there&apos;s a typo there: 21 should have a<br/>kappa followed by an alpha followed by a stroke ... the<br/>alpha is missing.)</p><p>this Greek usage is clearly derived from that of Hebrew,<br/>probably by way of Phoenician adoption of the Hebrew system,<br/>which is how the Greeks got their alphabet in the first<br/>place.</p><p>the Hebrew alphabet has 22 letters, alef...tet representing<br/>digits 1...9, yod...tzade representing tens 10...90, and<br/>qof...tav representing the hundreds 100...400.</p><p>see the explanation about halfway down this page:<br/><a href="http://www.jewfaq.org/alephbet.htm">http://www.jewfaq.org/alephbet.htm</a></p><p>  1  alef<br/>  2  bet<br/>  3  gimel<br/>  4  dalet<br/>  5  he<br/>  6  vav<br/>  7  zayin<br/>  8  chet<br/>  9  tet</p><p> 10  yod<br/> 20  kaf [or khaf]<br/> 30  lamed<br/> 40  mem [2 forms]<br/> 50  nun [2 forms]<br/> 60  samech<br/> 70  ayin<br/> 80  pe [or fe]<br/> 90  tzade [2 forms]</p><p>100  qof<br/>200  resh<br/>300  shin<br/>400  tav</p><p>perhaps i should also note that the ancient Egyptians<br/>knew how to use fractions, but it was also a very<br/>cumbersome system, based on successive division into<br/>unit fractions.</p><p>in any case, it should be easy for any of us, who are<br/>used to the simple 9-digit positional &quot;Arabic&quot; system,<br/>that doing *any* type of calculations with these systems<br/>is much more difficult than with our system.  it&apos;s not<br/>at all surprising to me that so many music-theorists tried<br/>very hard to find a way to represent tuning systems<br/>mathematically by using nothing but integers.</p><p>this really gets at the root of what i said in my last<br/>post about this: the formulation of the mathematical<br/>concepts of roots-and-powers, and logarithms, around 1600,<br/>enabled theorists to once again use simple integer<br/>calculations, but now to describe *irrational* tuning systems.</p><p>&gt; They unfortunately never learned from the Babylonians how<br/>&gt; to write numbers to a base.</p><p>hmmm ... well, Ptolemy certainly did!  his _Almagest_ gives<br/>all the astronomical data with &quot;minutes&quot; and &quot;seconds&quot; in<br/>base_60 for the decimal part.  i&apos;m not sure now about the<br/>ratios in his musical treatise ... i&apos;ll have to look again.</p><p>but in general, yes, you&apos;re correct that most Greek<br/>math eschewed the use of the sophisticated base_60 numbering<br/>of the Babylonians, and that fractional parts would not<br/>be calculated with such ease and precision again until<br/>the invention, again around 1600, of the regular<br/>&quot;decimal point&quot; system that we use today.</p><p>&gt; &gt; &gt; Also, the contrasting of that approach with that of<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; Rousseau was very interesting.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; can you summarize rousseau&apos;s approach? maybe i should just<br/>&gt; &gt; buy the book if i want to find out about this? gene?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Rousseau protruded himself into music theory, and one of<br/>&gt; the funny bits in Isacoff is the description of Rameau<br/>&gt; at the premire of Rousseau&apos;s opera, ghosted by Philidor.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I never read Rousseau on music, but it sounds just like<br/>&gt; you&apos;d think from Isacoff&apos;s description--melody is an<br/>&gt; expression of untamed erotic fervor, and is better than<br/>&gt; harmony, which is too darned civilized and calculating.<br/>&gt; Italian opera is better than French because it is more<br/>&gt; emotional, partly because the French language is better<br/>&gt; at logic than emotion, and partly because the Italians<br/>&gt; care first and formost about melody, not harmony.</p><p>sweeping generalizations!  which is probably at least partly<br/>why modern music-theory is so much more indebted to Rameau<br/>than Rousseau.</p><p>-monz</p><p>_________________________________________________________<br/>Do You Yahoo!?<br/>Get your free <a href="https://twitter.com/yahoo">@yahoo</a>.com address at <a href="http://mail.yahoo.com">http://mail.yahoo.com</a></p></div>
