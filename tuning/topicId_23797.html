It&apos;s an Excel spreadsheet. It simply does<br/>&gt; the same calculation for every generator between 0 to 600c in 0.1c<br/>&gt; increments. It calculates how many generators in a chain (up to some<br/>&gt; maximum) give the best (octave equivalent) approximation for each of<br/>&gt; 1:3, 1:5, 1:7, 1:11 and what the errors are. From those it calculates<br/>&gt; the hexad-width and the MA and RMS errors over all 11-limit intervals<br/>&gt; (consistency is guaranteed). Then it flags those that meet the set<br/>&gt; criteria for hexad-width and errors.</p><p>Oh, is that the thing I downloaded?  I might have another look if I ever<br/>get Excel installed on this machine.  I thought you mentioned it could be<br/>getting only local minima once, which would suggest a larger granularity<br/>and optimising from there.</p><p>My program&apos;s working now.  I rank temperaments by the product of the<br/>number of steps for a complete chord and the minimax error, then show the<br/>10 best ones.  Miracle actually comes out as third best for the 11-limit.<br/> I make it a 3.3 cent minimax error.  The two better ones require more<br/>notes to get that all-important hexad.  You can get to 1.3 cents accuracy<br/>with 49 notes or 2.4 cents with 31 notes.</p><p>The simplest 15-limit temperament in the top 10 is defined like this, by<br/>octaves and generators:</p><p>( 1   0)<br/>( 2  -1)<br/>(-1   8)<br/>(-3  14)<br/>(13 -23)<br/>(12 -20)</p><p>That means a 3:1 is two octaves minus a generator, so the generator is a<br/>fourth.  A 5:1 is 8 generators minus an octave.  That looks like schismic<br/>to me.  It&apos;s consistent with 41 and 94-equal.  You need 37 notes from a<br/>chain of fourths to get a 15-limit chord, and it&apos;s accurate to 4.9 cents.</p><p>The number one 15-limit temperament is consistent with 87 and 72, defined<br/>like this:</p><p>( 3   0)<br/>( 6  -6)<br/>( 8  -5)<br/>( 8   2)<br/>(11  -3)<br/>(14 -14)</p><p>It needs 16 generators for a complete chord, but because the octave<br/>divides into three I think that means 49 notes to the octave.  So it&apos;s<br/>fairly complex, but accurate to 2.8 cents.  I don&apos;t plan on tuning it up<br/>any time soon, but if anybody has a huge keyboard and wants to play with<br/>15-limit harmony, well, now you know an accurate temperament exists.</p><p>                   Graham</p></div><h3><a id=23799 href="#23799">ðŸ”—</a>Paul Erlich &#x3C;paul@stretch-music.com&#x3E;</h3><span>5/25/2001 10:33:26 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In tuning@y..., graham@m... wrote:</p><p>&gt; The number one 15-limit temperament is consistent with 87 and 72,<br/>defined<br/>&gt; like this:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; ( 3   0)<br/>&gt; ( 6  -6)<br/>&gt; ( 8  -5)<br/>&gt; ( 8   2)<br/>&gt; (11  -3)<br/>&gt; (14 -14)<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; It needs 16 generators for a complete chord, but because the octave<br/>&gt; divides into three</p><p>Ha!
