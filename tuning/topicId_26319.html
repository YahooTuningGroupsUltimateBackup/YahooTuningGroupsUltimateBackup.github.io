I am<br/>&gt; making this request to know whether, Indian music, performed in any<br/>&gt; particular way (or ways), will suit jamming better.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Would jamming go better with instrumental Indian music?  With/without<br/>&gt; taal? Tempo: slow/fast? Some raga-s more suitable than some others?<br/>&gt; etc. etc.</p><p>The one that I jammed along with was her duje_ke_sang_nahi_jaun.mp3</p><p>I don&apos;t know about technical music terms in Indian music, but a slow<br/>piece with rather few main notes that easily sit under the<br/>fingers on a base recorder.</p><p>I&apos;ve done an mp3 of part of it - just as it came with no attempt<br/>to correct it and do a second &quot;take&quot;. I&apos;m aware of the poor intonation<br/>in places (e.g. the last main note I play in the clip).</p><p><a href="http://groups.yahoo.com/group/tuning/files/Robert%20Walker/Veena_Sahasrabuddhe_base_rec_jamming.mp3">http://groups.yahoo.com/group/tuning/files/Robert%20Walker/Veena_Sahasrabuddhe_base_rec_jamming.mp3</a></p><p>Sorry also about the quality, as an mp3 of an mp3.</p><p>I&apos;m sure I can&apos;t put it on a web site for copyright, but perhaps it<br/>is okay to upload it to the files area - we have enough space.<br/>As soon as you&apos;ve heard it, I&apos;ll delete the file.</p><p>I immediately liked Indian music the first time I ever heard it.<br/>Since then I have been to very few Indian music concerts, and heard<br/>some on line, but have greatly enjoyed the ones I went to and<br/>this particular song I really like especially much on first hearing.</p><p>Robert</p></div><h3><a id=26334 href="#26334">ðŸ”—</a>Haresh BAKSHI &#x3C;hareshbakshi@hotmail.com&#x3E;</h3><span>7/19/2001 8:41:07 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In tuning@y..., &quot;Robert Walker&quot; &lt;robertwalker@n...&gt; wrote:</p><p>.........</p><p>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; I don&apos;t know about technical music terms in Indian music, but a<br/>slow piece with rather few main notes that easily sit under the<br/>fingers on a base recorder. &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;</p><p>Hi Robert, thanks for your response and illustrative mp3 file.  If it<br/>will be of any use to you, I volunteer to record a few raga-s for<br/>your jamming sessions and practice, in the key of your choice. They<br/>will be in slow alap-s, staying long on legitimate notes. I will<br/>select those raga-s which are amenable to accompaniement of soft<br/>chords.  I can record in MIDI format, to make tanpura track and<br/>chords track mutable.  I have Cubase VST.  Or, anyway you like and I<br/>can do.  I can record the main track in piano, or any instrument you<br/>choose and I may have (on the synthesizer).  I would prefer to use an<br/>instrument naturally capable of glissando [or, is it a mere matter of<br/>using pitch bend?]. I have to use 12-teT.  Can you tell me how to use<br/>MIDI and yet get JI? Or, will 12-teT do for now?</p><p>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; As soon as you&apos;ve heard it, I&apos;ll delete the file. &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;</p><p>Please delete it tomorrow (07/20 evening).</p><p>Regards,<br/>Haresh.</p></div><h3><a id=26759 href="#26759">ðŸ”—</a>Haresh BAKSHI &#x3C;hareshbakshi@hotmail.com&#x3E;</h3><span>8/7/2001 6:24:12 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Hello Robert,  I thought I would start with a couple of raga-s to be<br/>made suitable for jamming.
