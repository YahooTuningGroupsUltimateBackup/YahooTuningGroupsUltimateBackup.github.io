Usually (but not always) such intervals appear<br/>  &gt;&gt;  in scales because they lie a primary interval away from<br/>  &gt;&gt;  a tone which itself is a primary interval away from the tonic.<br/>  &gt;&gt;  Example: 15/8 in the classical JI pentatonic scale is not<br/>  &gt;&gt;  a consonance (primary ratio), but is a 5:4 above 3/2, which<br/>  &gt;&gt;  itself is 3:2 above the tonic.  In listing the primary<br/>  &gt;&gt;  intervals of the diatonic scale I would list...<br/>  &gt;&gt;<br/>  &gt;&gt;  5:4<br/>  &gt;&gt;  3:2<br/>  &gt;&gt;  5:3<br/>  &gt;&gt;<br/>  &gt;&gt;  ...and maybe their inversions, but not 15:8.<br/>  &gt;<br/>  &gt; You mean whether the intervals can be explained by a<br/>  &gt; Partch-scheme where the upper half is a mirror-image of the<br/>  &gt; lower half where the period is a tritone?</p><p>  No!

You are saying 15:8 is not listed because Zarlino&apos;s JI scale can be divided into two indentical tetrachords and a single one is sufficient to define consonace. From that perspective, you can consider the first tetrachord from Rast to Chargah sufficient. There, I have given the principle intervals you need if you will just replicate their fourth and fifth counterparts as required.</p><p>  &gt;   Now I don&apos;t know if Maqam music employs the concept of<br/>  &gt;   primary consonances (does it?) or even primary<br/>  &gt;   intervals (does it?)....<br/>  &gt;<br/>  &gt; I have developed a firm faith during my stay in the tuning<br/>  &gt;list that higher primes and primary consonances do matter.
