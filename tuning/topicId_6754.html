Briefly<br/>(I&apos;m not even going to pull quotes), some thoughts...</p><p>~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~</p><p>I can&apos;t remember the last time anyone on the list discussed a mechanically<br/>generated piece, i.e. through algorhythmic methods, chance, whatever. What<br/>is now the subject of discussion are musical pieces that all share a common<br/>genesis: produced (created) by human beings. What I find astonishing is<br/>that people will apply the same assumptions/standards/biases toward both 1.<br/>all compositions and 2. all composers -- as if they were all identical<br/>scenarios!</p><p>And they are not, of course.</p><p>Not every composer creates the same kind of music, and it should be<br/>patently obvious that some composers may take as great a care, and maybe<br/>more care, with their timbral canvas as their pitch palette (i.e.<br/>orchestration vs. melody/harmony). Sometimes, for crying out loud, it isn&apos;t<br/>just about notes. In those cases, mucking about with the delivery method<br/>for the notes may be just as much of a bastardization as if you go in and,<br/>wholesale, change harmonies, melodies, etc. Quite kindly of the<br/>experimenter, no?</p><p>There are so many threads that I find odd in the recent discourses, but<br/>mainly from one particular angle: a willful disrespect for a composer&apos;s own<br/>desires. How many times must we hear &quot;if he/she had only known/had the<br/>resources we have at our disposal today&quot;? Well, we do, but he/she didn&apos;t!<br/>How presumptuous of the &apos;arranger&apos;, then, to willy-nilly change much of the<br/>intrinsic fabric of a piece.</p><p>To reiterate: there are large areas of the musical landscape that are ripe<br/>for plucking (and retuning, and rearranging, etc.), but I have yet to see<br/>even one of the proponents actively acknowledge the existence of<br/>musics/performance works that stand *on their own*, without &apos;improvement&apos;.<br/>Oh, so much of the recent musings can only be termed &quot;idle speculation&quot; -<br/>with the flimsiest historical jottings, parties run off and alter as they<br/>see fit. What is most either galling or hilarious is the &quot;doing it in<br/>service of the composer&quot; line. Please.</p><p>One case in particular: the various postings from Johnny Reinhard have been<br/>tantalizing, but I for one will wait until JR collates all of it into one,<br/>well-documented, written, and conceived argument for the non-12tet nature<br/>of his Ives explorations. I don&apos;t *discount* it at this point, but the<br/>documentary evidence is woefully vague and insubstantial. But beyond this<br/>is *my* particular nagging question: here is a composer who so much<br/>stretched himself (and music) in terms of meter, orchestration, and sheer<br/>conceptualization of music -- if he were truly to be both enamored of, and<br/>committed to, alternate tunings in his music, how is it that the subject is<br/>only approached obliquely, minutely, with inference? I don&apos;t disbelieve,<br/>but I sure ain&apos;t convinced.</p><p>And the biggest question of all (for me): just how much of this is actually<br/>&quot;in service to the composer&quot;, and how much of it is egotistical<br/>coat-tailing? Really now, it is a hell of a lot easier to draw muso-strokes<br/>by saying &quot;J. S. Bach, arranged by Josephine Blow&quot; than it is to come up<br/>with a composition on your own. I once had an exchange with the leader of a<br/>famous string quartet that had appropriated music of a composer I feel<br/>strongly about (clear enough?), and this fellow said that there was music<br/>that &quot;he couldn&apos;t imagine not being involved in&quot;. Well, tough shit. Some<br/>composers, if they had *wanted* to write for a string quartet, would have<br/>written for a string quartet; *not* writing for a string quartet might even<br/>indicate something *more* than simply an omission. Yet the hubris in this<br/>person&apos;s statement rarely goes challenged, all in spite of the world of<br/>music that has been specifically commissioned and written for them. This, I<br/>propose, is disrespect for a composer&apos;s stated and explicit wishes. There<br/>are times, fellow tunologists, when you can&apos;t escape that fact.</p><p>To say that all music is fair game for your aural playground is not<br/>correct. To state that all composers would welcome your contributions to<br/>their compositional experiments is disingenuous and rude. As a very young<br/>man, I once heard Saint-Saens &quot;The Swan&quot; (from Carnival of the Animals)<br/>being played on marimba; it struck me as ludicrous and ugly -- before I had<br/>ever heard it on cello. I often think of the person that was playing the<br/>piece, and wonder just what the hell they were thinking; I can think of a<br/>number of answers, and they all fall flat. Personally, I&apos;ve written both<br/>kinds of music: pieces that are malleable and could exist in a number of<br/>arrangements, and pieces that are meant for one delivery only - surely that<br/>can&apos;t be too difficult to conceive!</p><p>So: tweak your tuning tables, change your temperments, alter your<br/>instrumentations (and vocalizations), substitute lyrics, change languages,<br/>do whatever you want. Just be honest about it: if the composer came up to<br/>you and asked you to please not do that to their work, would you tell them<br/>to piss off or respect their wishes?</p><p>Discuss.</p><p>Kisses and hugs,<br/>Jon<br/>&grave;&apos;&grave;&apos;&grave;&apos;&grave;&apos;&grave;&apos;&grave;&apos;&grave;&apos;&grave;&apos;&grave;&apos;&grave;&apos;&grave;&apos;&grave;&apos;&grave;&apos;&grave;&apos;&grave;&apos;&grave;&apos;&grave;&apos;&grave;&apos;&grave;&apos;&grave;&apos;&grave;&apos;&grave;&apos;&grave;&apos;&grave;&apos;&grave;&apos;&grave;&apos;&grave;&apos;&grave;&apos;&grave;&apos;&grave;&apos;&grave;&apos;&grave;&apos;&grave;&apos;&grave;<br/>    Jonathan M.
