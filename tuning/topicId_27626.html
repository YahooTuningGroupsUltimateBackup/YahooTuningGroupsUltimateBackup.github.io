It&apos;s too hard to post that here, but let me<br/>characterize it as a cross between &quot;chicken scratches&quot; and somebody<br/>trying to play &quot;tick tack toe...&quot;  It would be *very* difficult to<br/>distinguish this system in performance.  (I will scan it and put it<br/>up sometime if there is exaggerated interest in seeing it...)<br/>Basically it consists of anywhere from one to three vertical lines,<br/>and one to three horizontal lines going through these... not always<br/>all the way through... depending on the &quot;inflection...&quot;  There are,<br/>basically 11 different symbols.</p><p>Here is Sims&apos; commentary about this notation from his article:</p><p>&quot;I knew that if confronted with such a set of symbols, I&apos;d, myself,<br/>give up and go back to modal monody.  The graphic distinctions seemed<br/>too minute for practical purposes, the symbols too hard to<br/>distinguish in either rapid reading or writing.  So I worked up my<br/>own, which used rather fewer symbols in combination with the familiar<br/>accidentals.&quot;</p><p>This one we have a scan for... it&apos;s here:</p><p><a href="/tuning/files/Pehrson/Sims.GIF">/tuning/files/Pehrson/Sims.GIF</a></p><p>Anyway, somebody mentioned a while ago, and Sims does in his article,<br/>that the main reason for the use of a square root &quot;radical&quot; to<br/>indicate quarter tones stems from the idea that the quarter tone is<br/>the *24th* root of 2... hence the square root of the semitone (12th<br/>root of 2).  Well, that makes sense, and is the origin of that,<br/>er, &quot;peculiar&quot; symbol and it&apos;s inversion.  (As you can see on<br/>the .gif)</p><p>Many of us have been indicating these symbols in ascii as:  [ =<br/>quarter-tone down and ] = quarter-tone up...</p><p>Those ascii symbols are about the closest ascii match to the Sims...</p><p>Well, Sims&apos; idea of using the &quot;half arrows&quot; for 1/6 tones stems<br/>partially from the fact that he wanted a &quot;smaller&quot; visual sign for<br/>those.  You can also see them on the .gif.  In ascii, we have been<br/>using &lt; = 1/6 tone down, &gt; = 1/6 tone up.  Sims half arrows really<br/>look quite a bit like this, except they are rotated slightly and have<br/>one line longer from the vertex for each...</p><p>The 1/12 tone, which Sims concludes would be &quot;much less used&quot; gets a<br/>small arrow, upwards and downwards (please see .gif).  Our ascii<br/>notation uses the closest symbols to these arrows:  ^ = 1/12 tone up<br/>and v = 1/12 tone down...</p><p>Sims piece for solo viola was accepted for publication by the _Corpus<br/>Microtonale_ of Diapason Press.  Editor Rudolph Rasch suggested Sims<br/>use a notation for his piece that was *very* similar to the Haba.  A<br/>few of the crossing lines are different, but there still is this<br/>*multitude* of different inflections, both 11 for sharps and 11 for<br/>flats!</p><p>Sims objected strongly to the use of the modified Haba notation,<br/>since he felt it was impractical.  In a letter to the editor, Mr.<br/>Rasch, he states the following:</p><p>&quot;When I began writing in a 72-note temperament, I was well aware of<br/>the various notations that had been proposed.  Choosing not to use<br/>one of them was not the result of fascination with my own invention,<br/>and was done with full awareness that it would add yet another to an<br/>already sizeable repertory of competing possibilities.</p><p>&quot;I chose to use the system I do because it involved the least<br/>disruption of performers&apos; established habits and more accurately<br/>mirrored the way they would approach the identification of the<br/>pitches indicated.  I very much doubt I would have had the success<br/>with performers that I have had, had I been obliged to use a system<br/>like Haba&apos;s or the one you give in your letter.  In fact, I doubt I<br/>should have continued as a composer -- I&apos;d have gone over, I suspect,<br/>to something like library cataloguing, or computer programming,<br/>instead.&quot;</p><p>Fortunately, for all of us, Rudolph Rasch (not being so &quot;rash&quot; :) )<br/>relented, and used the Sims notation!</p><p>_________ _______ __________<br/>Joseph Pehrson</p></div>
