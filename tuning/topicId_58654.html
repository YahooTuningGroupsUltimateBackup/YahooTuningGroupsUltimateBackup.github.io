It&apos;s usually taught that the scale has two<br/> &gt; distinct forms, one ascending and the other descending.  For<br/> &gt; example, the C minor scale runs thus -<br/> &gt;<br/> &gt; Ascending: C D Eb F G A B C&apos;<br/> &gt; Descending: C&apos; Bb Ab G F Eb D C<br/> &gt;<br/> &gt; - and it&apos;s in _both_ those forms that countless music students<br/> &gt; for centuries have practiced it.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;</p><p>But even this is not a complete definition . . .after all, the C D Eb F<br/>and G  can be more or less freely ordered.  But the A-natural pretty much<br/>only occurs when it&apos;s leading into B,  and thence unto C.  Bb and Ab occur<br/>pretty much only as neighbors moving down to G.  Although Ab may occur<br/>freely  (just as a 6th scale degree.)  (The Bb and Ab are &quot;freer&quot; in<br/>general than the A B).</p><p>So it&apos;s really a very complex definition.</p><p>Perhaps we would profit from talking about 2 categories here:</p><p>SCALES:&#x9;&#x9;unordered collections of pitches</p><p>RAGS: (generalized from the Indian idea)&#x9;SCALES, or combinations of<br/>&#x9;scales, but with RULES about how to use one or more of their<br/>&#x9;pitches.</p><p>thus &quot;melodic minor&quot; is a very simple RAG of sorts,  comprising 2 related<br/>collections:  C D Eb F G A B,  and C D eb F G Ab Bb</p></div><h3><a id=58655 href="#58655">ðŸ”—</a>Afmmjr@aol.com</h3><span>5/22/2005 7:33:20 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>In a message dated 5/22/2005 10:25:07 AM Eastern Standard Time,<br/><a href="mailto:chris@music.columbia.edu">chris@music.columbia.edu</a> writes:<br/>But the A-natural pretty much<br/>only occurs when it&apos;s leading into B,  and thence unto C.<br/>Hi Chris,</p><p>If you are in C major, you can have a chord with an A natural in it.
