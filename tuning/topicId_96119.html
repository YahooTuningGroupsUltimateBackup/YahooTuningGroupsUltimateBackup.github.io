Sometimes it sounds like a vocalizer controlled by MIDI notes or whatever, sometimes it sounds like a speech synthesizer with given intonation, I&apos;m really not sure. But extending this to non-12-EDO scales may offer interesting possibilities:<br/><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zSgiXGELjbc&feature=fvsr">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zSgiXGELjbc&feature=fvsr</a></p><p>Petr</p></div>
