I could hear a lot of influences of Terry<br/>Riley,<br/>&gt;Steve Reich, even a little bit of Lou Harrison.  The music was very<br/>&gt;interesting, though some of it fell into the &quot;that&apos;s not music, that&apos;s<br/>&gt;noise&quot; category.  (But it was really good noise!)<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;Can anyone tell me more about Robert Davidson.  The announcer didn&apos;t<br/>mention<br/>&gt;anything about tunings, but it seemed obvious to me that Mr. Davidson<br/>is not<br/>&gt;tied to 12TET.</p><p>Pop your head into rec.music.classical.contemporary, I&apos;ve<br/>run into him a few times there. The Riley influence must<br/>come from his studying with Shri Riley.</p><p>But I&apos;ve never heard his music.</p><p>David Beardsley</p></div><h3><a id=849 href="#849">ðŸ”—</a>fasano@xxxxx.xxxxxxxxxxxxxxx)</h3><span>2/16/1999 6:11:08 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>At 05:07 PM 2/15/99 -0500, you wrote:<br/>&gt;&gt;Can anyone tell me more about Robert Davidson.</p><p><a href="http://www.under.org/cpccdirectory/dir_d.htm">http://www.under.org/cpccdirectory/dir_d.htm</a></p><p><a href="http://www.ozco.gov.au/whatsnew/Rel98_35.html:">http://www.ozco.gov.au/whatsnew/Rel98_35.html:</a><br/>&quot;Robert Davidson will compose a new work for orchestra and ancient Chinese<br/>string instrument, the Pipa, for Ensemble 24 (NSW) $3,800 for<br/>    performances featuring prize-winning Pipa player Xiao-lan Chen in<br/>Melbourne, country Victoria and Brisbane.&quot;</p><p><a href="http://www.amcoz.com.au/library/catd.htm:">http://www.amcoz.com.au/library/catd.htm:</a><br/>    a list of some scores</p></div>
