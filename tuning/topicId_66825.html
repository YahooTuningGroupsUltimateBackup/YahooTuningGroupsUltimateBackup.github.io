In theory the major third is best tuned as 5/4 and it is consonant when tuned in 12edo as 400 cents.  Various sources in my reading call the Pythagorean third 81/64 unharmonic even though it is only a few cents higher then 400 cents.  On my old homemade guitar (now broken) the raised third 9/7 is a howler even though it is a somewhat simple ratio.  By Parchian reasoning should be somewhat harmonic.  The supramajor third 9/7 does have three low pairs of harmonics that clash as semitones. 21/16 has a similar overtone clash.</p><p>  There is very little space between the consonant 12edo third and the somewhat dissonant Pythagorean third.  I believe the ultraconsonant high third of the site above must be between the Pythagorean third and 9/7.   Still, it is hard to believe the real estate around the major third is so variable.</p><p>  When I test this thirdish region with pure tone harmonies I simply observe a gradual increase in brightness and a decrease in dissonance.</p><p>  My own theory is that this third is some other whole number ratio with a lesser partial clash. (Simple ratios may not equal greater consonance as Partch preaches.)   I also suspect this third may be more dissonant if played in upper registers where the partial clash is harsher.  The demo is played in a very low register which may tend to soften the partial clash.  Also, perhaps this interval is not so consonant on instruments with strong overtones.</p><p>  I would like to know the EXACT tuning (in cents) of the most consonant high third.<br/>  Peoples observations and input should also be very interesting since we have here a clash between theory and observation.   It seems we all could learn a great deal.</p><p>This challenges many points of music theory.   Do other intervalic regions have similar issues?  What is the true foundation of consonance?  Should we consider putting this raised third in our scales?  Should the dissonant frequency ratios near the P4th be treated like the 4th and be avoided in the bass?  Should we adjust our rules of harmony to control partial clashes?  (This point is almost completely ignored in classic music theory.)  Should we used this raised third as an enhanced leading tone and perhaps use a harmonic and melodic major scale?  Can we even trust just intonation as the ideal if it errors so much on an issue as basic as the nature of the Major triad?</p><p> __________________________________________________<br/>Do You Yahoo!?<br/>Tired of spam?

I think the adoption of the 5/4 third in Western music, which<br/>historically did happen before the 400 cent third came in vogue, is<br/>tracable largely to the practice of harmonized singing without<br/>instrumental support. The exact same thing happened in Barbershop,<br/>this time with the 7/4 interval.</p><p>&gt;   The main point I was trying to make was that<br/>&gt;   consonance is not just related to the simplicity<br/>&gt;   of frequency ratios.  Partial clashes are also important<br/>&gt;   and they are not strictly related to simplicity.</p><p>A particular kind of sound will only occur with sustained &quot;otonal&quot;<br/>chords in just or nearly just intonation, and choirs listening to each<br/>other can zero in on such chords, producing the particular harmonic<br/>effect. A 1-9/7-3/2 chord isn&apos;t best understood as an otonal chord,<br/>and is not likely to work from this point of view, I think. But a<br/>1-5/3-3/2 chord most definately does.</p><p>&gt;   The contradiction here is that the Pythagorean third is<br/>&gt;   bad enough that some writers such as Yasser and<br/>&gt;   Helmholtz claim it stunted the development of harmony<br/>&gt;   based on thirds.</p><p>In medieval Europe, composers began composing pieces with the idea of<br/>vertical harmony in mind--true chords. However, the sharp major thirds<br/>were treated as dissonances.</p><p>Then, something funny happened, apparently in England. People, used to<br/>the idea of part-singing, began to do it in a folk context. They seem<br/>to have discovered, just as Barbershop groups did in the last century,<br/>that certain kinds of harmonies made for a unique sound. At least, it<br/>is difficult to see how else to explain &quot;Sumer is Icumen In&quot;, which<br/>dates to the mid Thirteenth Century. Late Medieval English composers,<br/>John Dunstaple and Leonel Powers, began lingering over thirds, and<br/>composers on the continent, in particular the Burgundian school around<br/>Dufay, took note of the unique sound and imported it into their own<br/>music. The third and triadic harmony was launched.</p><p>As to whether Pythagorean tuning impeded this process, the diminished<br/>fourth interval C-Fb, is a nearly pure major third in Pythagorean<br/>tuning, and this may have been used for a time, Mark Lindley suggests;<br/>which would mean also a parallel development of the third stemming<br/>from the tuning system in use of the time, rather than from<br/>adjustments made in the course of a capella singing, and including<br/>keyboards. But I think a capella singing was the key factor myself.</p><p>Yet the 400 cent third just below it a<br/>&gt;   few cents encouraged the use of thirds in harmony.</p><p>I don&apos;t think it encourages thirds all that much. It works with busier<br/>music, but it&apos;s pretty much of a disaster with Renassiance polyphony.</p></div><h3>Gene Ward Smith &#x3C;genewardsmith@coolgoose.com&#x3E;</h3><span>6/13/2006 11:33:30 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;Gene Ward Smith&quot; &lt;genewardsmith@...&gt;<br/>wrote:<br/>&gt; A 1-9/7-3/2 chord isn&apos;t best understood as an otonal chord,<br/>&gt; and is not likely to work from this point of view, I think.

I think a part of the issue is this:<br/>A professional piano tuner and barbershop singer I know had adiscussion<br/>with me in which he argued that even going from a one chord to a five-seven,<br/>such a C major to G7, that even the G note held from chord to chord needed<br/>to sharp for the G7 chord!  This guy really is no slouch and is totally clear<br/>on the issues.  He tunes his pianos unconventionally to acheive beatless<br/>5ths.  He is not fundamentalist classical theorist.</p><p>When it came to discussing the 3rd, he said that we need to tell singers to<br/>sharp.  He asked, &quot;how often do you hear barbershoppers with their thirds<br/>too sharp?&quot;<br/>But even though his overall statement was vague and simplistic, there&apos;s<br/>something to it.  Perhaps away from the piano, a cappella singers are as<br/>or more likely to be flat of 5/4 than sharp.  So telling them to sharp gets<br/>closer to 5/4.  And maybe they subjectively feel that the tuning that sounds<br/>good is when they THINK &quot;sharp.&quot;</p><p>When we remember that the reality of pitch and vocal folds is one of<br/>fast and slow, we realize that just like a motor, relaxing will lead to slowing<br/>down, which means flatting.  So it takes energy and focus to maintain pitch<br/>and not sing flat.  So singers are generally taught to think sharp.</p><p>As a teacher, I feel it is better to expose singers to the issues and challenges<br/>of singing so they learn to support and maintain pitch, and then teach them<br/>to sing &quot;right&quot; not flat or sharp.   And &quot;right&quot; for blended harmony in major<br/>chords is undeniably 5/4.</p><p>I&apos;ve heard a couple singers sing thirds sharp, and those are the two in my<br/>chapter who are piano players with perfect pitch.  And when I tell them to<br/>slightly flat, they find the blended 5/4 and agree that it&apos;s what we&apos;re aiming<br/>for.  Everyone else in the group is more likely to sing thirds flat than sharp.</p><p>What we have to remember is that the vast majority of musicians (let alone<br/>the general public) don&apos;t really have a sense of pitch that is THAT fine<br/>tuned as to know and remember what piano thirds sound like once you<br/>apply any other timbre to the harmony.  So we can&apos;t use the piano or the 5/4<br/>reference point when talking about &quot;sharp&quot; or &quot;flat.&quot;</p><p>My friend&apos;s admonition that we must tell singers to sing &quot;sharp&quot; is clearly<br/>from a sense that most are flat.  It is completely foundless to take his<br/>statement and infer that you know what starting point he is telling singers<br/>to sing sharp OF.</p><p>A professor of mine who had perfect pitch said the same thing about<br/>playing thirds sharp on a violin, but another violinist with perfect pitch<br/>told me they blend better when flat of piano notes.  Which leads to one<br/>further issue.  In many cases, musicians are listening horizontally and<br/>sharp the third as a leading tone to the next note.  This is a melodic<br/>function and has not much to do with what &quot;blends.&quot;  And I expect that is<br/>what we are talking about when we objectively have sharp thirds (as opposed<br/>to sharper than flat, meaning correct 5/4 thirds).</p><p>-Aaron</p><p>P.S.
