Thanks for making this list a<br/>&gt;much more interesting place!</p><p>I try to dedicate some time to this group since just intonation<br/>theory is just my hobby. Sometimes this is very hard to do... so I<br/>apologize eventually for my really late answers...<br/>Of course I&apos;m the last here.. So please, be patient with me. I&apos;m<br/>really ignorant about a lot of things. :-)</p><p>&gt;&gt; This is not true to my ears but I understand that this could be<br/>&gt;&gt; subjective. I think is less subjective that the chord: 1/1, 3/2,<br/>9/4<br/>&gt;&gt; is much less complex than any other chords which includes 7/5.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;But that&apos;s not a fair comparison.<br/>&gt;Any such chord will have *two* 3:2s in it!!! So of course it will<br/>&gt;show up as much simpler than any chord which includes 7/5!</p><p>This means that 9/4 is a good condition for ratios simplicity.<br/>This is very important. I would call this &quot;relationship consonance&quot;.<br/>Certainly, as you wrote, the possibilities to develop a simpler<br/>chord are major in presence of 9/4 instead of 7/5.<br/>We were discussing about complexity and I still consider 9/4 less<br/>complex than 7/5, also for this reason (the sound of the single<br/>intervals is another reason).<br/>Odd numbers complexity measure don&apos;t respect these observation<br/>(since 9/4 should be more complex than 7/5) and for these reason I<br/>don&apos;t think it is a good way to measure ratios complexity.</p><p>&gt;But chord<br/>&gt;complexity and interval complexity are two different things. Each<br/>&gt;interval, and their combined effect, must be included in an<br/>&gt;evaluation of chord complexity.</p><p>Yes. But chord complexity and interval complexity are interdependent<br/>aspects.<br/>As I&apos;ve written this defines 9/4 simpler than 7/5 for the<br/>best &quot;relationship consonance&quot;.<br/>This is the reason why the chord 1/1, 7/5 and 3/2 is more complex<br/>than 1/1, 9/4 and 3/2: 9/4 is simpler than 7/5.<br/>So I think that odd numbers ratios complexity measure don&apos;t work.<br/>Primes measure works better. And one kind of complexity measure<br/>excludes the other one.</p><p>&gt;A third note in a chord provides some &quot;juice&quot; that helps swallow<br/>&gt;complex composite intervals. Without such additional notes, the<br/>&gt;factorability is no aid whatsoever, and the interval dry as toast.</p><p>I don&apos;t understand this.</p><p>&gt;&gt; I think a good complexity measure would have<br/>&gt;&gt; to work in these cases too.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; It works exactly as it should, since 15/12 and 5/4 are identical.</p><p>If 15/12 and 5/4 would be &quot;identical&quot; odd numbers measure would work<br/>in an &quot;identical&quot; way.<br/>But this is not true since you have to reduce the ratio to obtain a<br/>right complexity measure.<br/>Using primes as measure you don&apos;t have this inconvenience. This<br/>confirm me that primes measure works better: in a more generalized<br/>way.</p><p>&gt;&gt; Complexity has to do with the &quot;digestibility&quot; of prime numbers.<br/>&gt;&gt; To understand you can think to the growing rhythmic complexity<br/>&gt;&gt; between a couple of notes, a triplet of them, a quintlet (not<br/>&gt;&gt; sure this is the right word...), a septlet (?)....<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;I don&apos;t think the rhythmic analogy holds in the pitch sphere when it<br/>&gt;comes to dyadic complexity. Complexity of larger musical units (such<br/>&gt;as chords or even entire infinite tuning systems) has to be<br/>&gt;considered as a separate and larger problem, and there are indeed<br/>&gt;fruitful lines of investigation in these regards on these lists,<br/>&gt;especially the tuning-math and harmonic_entropy lists.</p><p>I think there are two components in perceiving complexity of dyads.<br/>The first is based upon the numbers of common harmonics and the<br/>critical bandwith. I think that this aspect is very related to the<br/>subject of perception.</p><p>The second thing is the intrinsecal object complexity.<br/>Considering 2:1, 3:1 and 7:1 i listen to pairs of sounds with all<br/>the harmonics in common. Anyway I hear *different* things. I feel<br/>this difference is based on primes families.</p><p>Ciao</p><p>Lorenzo</p></div><h3><a id=53872 href="#53872">ðŸ”—</a>wallyesterpaulrus &#x3C;paul@stretch-music.com&#x3E;</h3><span>7/2/2004 6:26:22 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;frizzerius&quot; &lt;lorenzo.frizzera@l...&gt;<br/>wrote:</p><p>&gt; &gt;&gt; This is not true to my ears but I understand that this could be<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt; subjective.

You<br/>can read Helmholtz, Kameoka &amp; Kuriyagawa, or Sethares, and you&apos;ll see<br/>the same result for this part of the investigation -- size of the<br/>numbers matters, prime factorization doesn&apos;t.</p><p>&gt; The second thing is the intrinsecal object complexity.<br/>&gt; Considering 2:1, 3:1 and 7:1 i listen to pairs of sounds with all<br/>&gt; the harmonics in common.</p><p>I&apos;m not sure exactly what you mean here. To me, the second thing<br/>consists in how well a chord resembles a harmonic series -- and this<br/>applies even when there are no harmonics and no critical band<br/>roughness to speak of! But since we&apos;re talking about dyads, there&apos;s<br/>no pressing need to follow this angle anyway . . .</p><p>&gt; Anyway I hear *different* things. I feel<br/>&gt; this difference is based on primes families.</p><p>Prime factorization is very useful in certain contexts.
