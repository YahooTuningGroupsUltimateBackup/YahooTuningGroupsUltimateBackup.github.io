Some of these notes<br/>are impure and cause problems with intonation, especially if the trumpet is<br/>played together with an instrument of fixed pitch, like the organ.  The 11th<br/>harmonic is too high for F&apos; and too low for F#&quot;; the 13th is too low for A&quot;<br/>and is nearer to G#&quot;; the 7th and 14th harmonics are slightly too low for<br/>Bb&apos; and Bb&quot;, respectively.  In mean-tone temperament, however, the impure<br/>notes are less conspicuous and an experienced performer can reduce these<br/>problems by his embouchure.  This is also easier on an old trumpet because<br/>of irregularities in the tubing.  The matter is complicated by modern<br/>replicas, with even tubing which makes the pitch of every harmonic more<br/>stable.  As the harmonics in the upper register lie very close together, it<br/>is difficult to achieve secure attack.  With the modern valve trumpet<br/>lower harmonics are used, making the attack more secure.  The modern trumpet,<br/>with its six valve combinations, is, in fact, a combination of seven<br/>natural trumpets.  On the other hand the valve trumpet needs more wind than<br/>the natural trumpet, the player will, therefore, have to be prepared to<br/>adjust his technique to achieve a secure attack with the natural instrument.<br/>In order to help the modern performer shift between the valve and natural<br/>trumpet a finger-hole system was devised in 1960 by Otto Steinkopf.  By<br/>opening one hole all even-numbered harmonics are excluded and by opening<br/>another all the odd ones.  In this way, by opening one of the holes the<br/>nearest harmonic can be excluded, giving greater security of attack. . .<br/>Trumpets with such holes may be call Baroque trumpets, to distinguish them<br/>from pure natural trumpets.</p><p>...In the first years of the 17th century trumpet parts were confined to<br/>a limited number of notes, as, for example, in the 5-part trumpet _Toccata_<br/>in Monteverdi&apos;s _Orfeo_.  The melodic part ... consisted only of the notes<br/>C&quot;, D&quot;, E&quot;, F&quot;, and G&quot;, and less often A&quot;.  Fantini broke with this<br/>tradition and developed a use of the solo trumpet in its entire range, from<br/>the 2nd to the 16th harmonic, from C to C&apos;&quot;.<br/>&quot;</p></div>
