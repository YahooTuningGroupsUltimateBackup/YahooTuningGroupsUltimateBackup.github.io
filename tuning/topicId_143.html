But I swear on occasion I&apos;ve seen things a thousand<br/>&gt; times more complicated that I can cogitate expanding and contracting<br/>&gt; right before me just beyond the threshold of retention.</p><p>&gt; Like I wasn&apos;t exhausted enough already! That&apos;s kind of like talking in<br/>&gt; your sleep and saying &quot;I&apos;m so tired&quot; -- madness!</p><p>Yes, I can&apos;t remember what particularly I was working on at the time,<br/>but I know one of the things I was trying to understand was<br/>Godel&apos;s proof of his incompleteness theorem for arithmetic.</p><p>That kind of thing can easily set one into a kind of mind boggling<br/>infinite recursion. Actually you can even get a bit dizzy if one<br/>focusses really hard on it.</p><p>Other times it is geometrical things that attract ones attention<br/>in this same compelling way, e.g. trying to figure out all the faces<br/>of some complex geometrical figure and how they fit together<br/>- not that well advised a thing to do while cycling!</p><p>Other times, can be abstract algebraic things, or a particular<br/>step in a proof that one is trying to figure out, or a key concept<br/>one needs to define in order to carry through a proof, and one<br/>kind of keeps worrying at it like a dog with a bone, trying<br/>to figure it out. Then one might suddenly see it, and it may<br/>be something really easy actually, at that point.</p><p>I well remember getting involved in all of those at one time or<br/>another.</p><p>Yes, and sleep is what often gives it a chance to sort itself<br/>out, it is fairly common I think for a mathematician to go to bed<br/>with a proof in a very incomplete state, and wake up with the<br/>key idea, or a few key ideas, so that it is all finished bar<br/>the writing out and polishing up of the presentation.</p><p>I&apos;m not sure whether that happens in ones sleep, or just very fast<br/>in the relaxed moments while one awakens. At any rate, something<br/>goes on there that seems to be sometimes way beyond ones mormal<br/>problem solving ability - in terms of the speed with which it happens<br/>anyway.</p><p>I&apos;m inclined to think it actually happens very fast at the moment<br/>one wakes up.</p><p>Can also happen in other situations. A famous mathematician<br/>at Oxford got the key idea that was the basis for one of the<br/>theorems he is famous for while crossing a street with someone<br/>else. He just had a feeling of having glimpsed something<br/>very significant, but couldn&apos;t remember what it was.<br/>Then later, when on his own, he tried to remember<br/>what it was, and eventually succeeded in recovering it.</p><p>That&apos;s Professor Roger Penrose and his theorem that<br/>collapsing black holes will always collapse to a singularity and<br/>can&apos;t avoid it by kind of collapsing through themselves<br/>in an asymmetrical way and bouncing out again, no matter<br/>what the initial state. Accounts of his experience in books.</p><p>The key ideas may be ones that can be expressed quite simply,<br/>which is why one can remember them. That happens in maths -<br/>you get an idea that is in essence very simple, you can<br/>just see it, quite intuitively. But when you try to write it<br/>down, it may take many words to follow it all through, with<br/>all the steps in the proof just falling out in a perfect fashion.</p><p>One wonders then how it is that one got at them, how<br/>one knew, or at least felt so sure, that this approach<br/>was going to work.</p><p>All htis happens in a dramatic way for some, as in Professor<br/>Penrose&apos;s experience. But it also happens in a more plodding<br/>kind of way. Either when trying to prove something, or<br/>when trying to understand a proof working through line<br/>by line.</p><p>You worry away at it, and then often at a moment of relaxation<br/>when no longer thinking about it, one then suddenly sees<br/>what it was about.</p><p>Or I think in even smaller ways, when going through proof<br/>step by step, you look at a line maybe two or three times<br/>sometimes and can&apos;t quite see how it follows from the<br/>previuos one, then suddently do see it, and that is<br/>kind of a bit mysterious too, how that happens.</p><p>This has often been written about by mathematicians.</p><p>However, it isn&apos;t 100% reliable. Sometimes you get a<br/>wonderful idea in much the same fashion, but when you<br/>try to follow it through, it just doesn&apos;t work at all.<br/>So one can also make mistakes at this intuitive level<br/>just as one does in the ordinary way of maths.</p><p>That has happened to me too. Doesn&apos;t seem to get quite<br/>such a write up as the cases where it does work :-)</p><p>Robert</p></div>
