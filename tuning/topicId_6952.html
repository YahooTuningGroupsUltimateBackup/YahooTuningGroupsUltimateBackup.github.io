Make sure you back everything up<br/>before loading either.  From what I remember, the TX81Z settings are on<br/>channel 1, and the DX21 on channel 2.</p><p>I&apos;m not that impressed with the built-in TX81Z presets, partly because<br/>most of them don&apos;t even respond to key velocities, which is something FM<br/>is naturally good at.  The pianos do, but distort if you play them too<br/>loud.  I generally don&apos;t rate it for emulating acoustic instruments, but<br/>YMMV.  For creating your own sounds, and making them come alive with key<br/>velocity, modulation and things, it puts more recent machines to shame.<br/>You can only play 8 notes at a time, but you can multitrack it.  It<br/>doesn&apos;t have built in effects, but you can use external ones.</p><p>&gt;Now, these two &quot;pure&quot; tunings seem to be some kind of approximate just<br/>&gt;intonation.  I am not certain what limit, and have not yet done the<br/>&gt;calculations to determine this...  If anyone out there in the &quot;blue<br/>&gt;yonder&quot;<br/>&gt;knows more about this feature of the TX81Z than I do, please &quot;chime&quot;<br/>in...</p><p>They&apos;re listed in the manual, in cents anyway.  The &quot;pure&quot; tunings are<br/>5-limit JI (or nearest approximation).</p><p>&gt;These &quot;pure&quot; tunings, as they should, can be set from a starting point of<br/>&gt;any &quot;key,&quot; ie. C, Cb, D, etc.  The &quot;minor&quot; variants of this look like<br/>&gt;pretty much the same kinds of tuning, from different starting points...</p><p>I don&apos;t thing the minors are exact transpositions.  I seem to remember<br/>there&apos;s one note different.</p><p>&gt;Frankly, when I was working with just intonation, I set my own tuning...</p><p>Of course, you can&apos;t expect the same 12 notes to suit all situations.</p><p>&gt;5) Pythagorean [set key]</p><p>&gt;This tuning &quot;adjusts&quot; fifths so they come out pure(er) than equal.  They<br/>&gt;don&apos;t seem to be worried much about the &quot;Pythagorean comma&quot;...  I was<br/>&gt;looking around for it...</p><p>As meantone, but different fifths, I think.  The wolf should be there<br/>(between G# and Eb for C tuning IIRC).  The fifths are the best you can<br/>get: unfortunately the 768-equal tuning steps fall either side of the 3/2.</p><p>&gt;I don&apos;t know if<br/>&gt;anyone here on the list can hear a 1.5 cent deviation... most people<br/>&gt;can&apos;t.</p><p>It can be audible in chords.  As an extreme example, try a unison mistuned<br/>by this amount.</p><p>&gt; Each pitch can only be tuned up or down by 32 T.U. (tuning units) which<br/>&gt;equals, therefore, 49.92 cents or the quarter-tone.  (But then the pitch<br/>&gt;above can be tuned DOWN, instead, so you can get whatever you want...)<br/>&gt;Keep in mind that any basic note can be assigned to ANY 12t-ET note<br/>within<br/>&gt;the range of the entire instrument, and then altered from there -- so<br/>&gt;virtually the entire sound span is reachable-- limited only by the number<br/>&gt;of total &quot;notes&quot; available.</p><p>This is an artifact of the display.  If you use the &quot;cursor&quot; you can<br/>select each pitch in tuning steps, and ignore the nearest note.  I think<br/>you can only tune to an 8 octave range, but all 128 notes can be tuned<br/>this way.  Also, you can set the voices to be an octave or so higher or<br/>lower than written.</p><p>&gt;One of the limitations is that although there are possibilities for 24<br/>&gt;&quot;performance&quot; settings -- with any instruments and number of voices<br/>&gt;available on the TX81Z, there is only ONE choice per &quot;performance&quot; of a<br/>&gt;microtonal set.  It can either be one of the presets or one of the two<br/>&gt;&quot;user definable&quot; tunings...  Therefore, there can really only be one<br/>&gt;microtonal tuning per performance in addition to 12t-ET (sorry,<br/>&gt;&quot;polymicrotonalists!&quot;)  Some of the channels can be playing the<br/>microtonal<br/>&gt;tuning simultaneously with others playing 12t-ET, if anyone would<br/>&gt;conceivably want that...</p><p>You may want to mix with 12=, say if you have a noisy percussion sound<br/>where tuning isn&apos;t important.  Or if you want to get 24= across two<br/>channels.  If you really want polymicrotonality, you can set different<br/>scales in different octave ranges.  Also, the performance settings allow<br/>each instrument to be transposed in equal semitones, so you can have the<br/>same scale (say Partch&apos;s 43 notes) in different octaves.</p><p>Does anybody know if this fancy new FS1R supports tuning tables, then?  I<br/>suppose it&apos;s ominous, as it isn&apos;t in John Loffink&apos;s list, but I&apos;ve never<br/>heard for certain that it isn&apos;t capable.  It looks quite good otherwise.</p><p>Oh, Pat, I haven&apos;t worked out how to load those .syx files yet, although I<br/>know I can do it!</p></div>
