Several people showed an interest in playing<br/>in Edinburgh at some point for which I am grateful. However they were<br/>all USA  or mainland Europe based which is very beautiful but I would be<br/>interested to hear from any British performers who feel that they might<br/>be able to offer interesting JI/Microtonal performances. I am about to<br/>negotiate with various individuals and institutions and I feel that they<br/>will want to see some interest from within the UK to get the ball<br/>rolling. It might be important if funding becomes an issue.</p><p>Again, no promises, but it will have to happen one day.</p></div>
