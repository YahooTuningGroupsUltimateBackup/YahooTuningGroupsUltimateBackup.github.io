I&apos;d like to know if anyone<br/>finds this useful, as i have similar info on other ETs.</p><p>/Mats &Ouml;ljare</p></div><h3><a id=31191 href="#31191">ðŸ”—</a>paulerlich &#x3C;paul@stretch-music.com&#x3E;</h3><span>12/9/2001 5:40:35 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In tuning@y..., &quot;oljare&quot; &lt;oljare@h...&gt; wrote:</p><p>&gt; So here i will attempt a rundown of the different scales available<br/>in<br/>&gt; 19TET.</p><p>Hi Mats.</p><p>Might I suggest raising this as a subject of discussion at</p><p><a href="mailto:tuning-math@yahoogroups.com">tuning-math@yahoogroups.com</a><br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; There are also a bunch of&quot;borderline MOS&quot;scales that has all but<br/>one<br/>&gt; interval of the same size,such as the&quot;whole tone scale&quot;,but these i<br/>do<br/>&gt; not count.</p><p>Some people might think these should count the most.</p><p>&gt; Also there are the various altered and Meta-MOS modes of the scales<br/>in<br/>&gt; here, that i may go through another time.
