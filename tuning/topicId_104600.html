Every instance of the terms has been swapped; I was very<br/>thorough and changed various pages referencing it, scale names, etc.<br/>You can check the history to see exactly what I changed. Redirects<br/>were added as a fallback so there shouldn&apos;t be any problem. This<br/>should also bring Graham&apos;s temperament finder up to speed too.</p><p>The one thing that needs changing still is the &quot;Semiphore&quot; picture on<br/>the &quot;Chromatic Pairs&quot; page, which still says Semiphore. I pinged<br/>Andrew Heathwaite to see if he could make another GIF with the name<br/>changed. I doubt that&apos;ll be much of an issue.</p><p>This raises one question though: the thing called the &quot;Semaphore<br/>family&quot;, e.g. the <a href="http://2.3.5.7">2.3.5.7</a> 49/48 planar temperament, is now called the<br/>&quot;Semiphore family.&quot; But do we really want to actually call this family<br/>the &quot;semiphore family&quot;? I think it might make more sense if we just<br/>called the whole family the &quot;semaphore family,&quot; but then the <a href="http://2.3.5.7">2.3.5.7</a><br/>49/48 planar temperament itself could be &quot;semaphore.&quot; It would be the<br/>same sort of thing as the &quot;pelogic family&quot; where the main temperament<br/>is &quot;mavila&quot; instead of &quot;pelogic.&quot; Thoughts?</p><p>-Mike</p></div>
