You may arrive at a position different<br/>from any of the &quot;sides&quot; so far established in this debate, and maybe<br/>create some beautiful new music in the process!</p><p>----------------------------------<br/>1. Of intervals, ratios, and cents<br/>----------------------------------</p><p>In this dialogue, I suspect, the term &quot;RI&quot; can mean two quite<br/>different things, both of which may be found in my posts, and which I<br/>enthusiastically embrace as choices, not as universal imperatives.</p><p>First, RI can mean, in its strict or proper interpretation, designing<br/>or using a tuning based on integer ratios only, often with a<br/>characteristic mixture of simple and complex ratios.</p><p>Pythagorean intonation, either in its classic medieval European form,<br/>for example, or in some 21st-century extensions and variations, is an<br/>RI system. Discussing the large as well as the small ratios generated<br/>by a chain of pure fifths is a tradition going back at least to the<br/>medieval European theorists, and indeed also to the Chinese theorists<br/>surveyed by James Murray Barbour and others.</p><p>Secondly, as illustrated in the recent thread about 46-tone equal<br/>temperament (46-tET) which prompted this dialogue, &quot;RI&quot; seems more<br/>loosely to mean the use of large as well as small integer ratios as<br/>reference points of a kind in describing the vertical or harmonic and<br/>the melodic resources of a temperament based wholly or largely on<br/>irrational ratios.</p><p>For example, here I think that there is no disagreement that either<br/>46-tET or the almost identical regular temperament with pure 11:14<br/>major thirds at around 417.51 cents is indeed a _temperament_, not a<br/>tuning based on integer ratios other than the 11:14 third (and 7:11<br/>minor sixth at ~782.49 cents, its inversion or octave complement),<br/>which may or may not be especially relevant depending on the style in<br/>question.</p><p>Please note that here, as in other articles, I have specified the<br/>fifth generating this 11:14 tuning as around 704.38 cents, and the<br/>fifth of the 46-tET division as around 704.35 cents, using cents as a<br/>measure rather than attempting any rational approximation. Here the<br/>&quot;sides&quot; are agreed: cents are a very useful measure for rational and<br/>irreational intervals alike.[1]</p><p>Now we come to what may be the main disagreement between the &quot;sides&quot;:<br/>not the utility of measuring interval sizes in cents, but the<br/>propriety of sometimes using _large_ integer ratios as one possible<br/>kind of emblematic reference or &quot;mapping&quot; of the open continuum.</p><p>Specifically, I have observed and observe now that in a neo-Gothic<br/>approach to 21st-century music based on a mixture of 13th-14th century<br/>Gothic styles in Europe with some new elements, the 11:14 tuning or<br/>46-tET nicely provides or approximates a set of rather complex<br/>intervals called the &quot;Four Convivial Ratios.&quot;</p><p>Two of these ratios, 11:14 and 11:13 (~289.21 cents), are for regular<br/>thirds formed from 4 fifths up or 3 fifths down; the other two, 17:21<br/>(~365.83 cents) and 14:17 (~336.13 cents), are for what might be<br/>termed &quot;submajor/supraminor&quot; thirds formed by 8 fifths down or 9<br/>fifths up.</p><p>These ratios are simply possible points of reference on the continuum,<br/>like other ratios often cited here with smaller integers. They do not<br/>limit the range of musical expression, but merely provide some more<br/>&quot;points on the map&quot; for the approximate and imperfect description of a<br/>most subtly gradated sonorous reality.</p><p>Thus the debate is not on whether to use cents as a most helpful<br/>measure, nor in general on whether it is appropriate or useful to<br/>describe equal or other irrational temperaments in reference to<br/>integer ratios -- although the latter issue seems one well worth<br/>discussing.</p><p>Rather it is a debate as to whether mentioning certain &quot;ratios that<br/>dare not speak their names&quot; -- ratios not fitting within a certain<br/>kind of harmonic outlook -- is appropriate.</p><p>My answer is that, at a minimum, it is appropriate to mention them in<br/>conjunction with any style where they are part of the accompanying<br/>theory, as with neo-Gothic music</p><p>To do otherwise, in fact, would be a form of self-censorship denying<br/>readers the opportunity to learn about the theory of a music as<br/>formulated by the makers of that music themselves. Such a policy, it<br/>seems to me, would reduce the range of a musical and conceptual<br/>diversity that we should seek to foster and encourage.</p><p>Of course, with more complex ratios, it is often an interesting<br/>question whether they are &quot;audibly distinct&quot; intervals or sonorities,<br/>or more like arbitrary reference points or names to describe what are,<br/>in effect, degrees of &quot;tempering by ratio.&quot; As I wrote in one of the<br/>posts providing a basis for this controversy:</p><p>      What I realize here is that how one associates 46-tET intervals<br/>      with integer ratios may in part be a matter of style: one<br/>      approach is to look mainly for comparatively simple ratios<br/>      like 9:11 or 8:13; another is to look for more complex<br/>      categories such as 14:17 or 21:34, which might be heard in<br/>      many contexts more in effect as shades of temperament than as<br/>      distinct relations between harmonic partials.</p><p>Having said this, I would also like warmly to support as a helpful<br/>practice the custom of always giving the value in cents for an integer<br/>ratio when it is first mentioned, even if this seems &quot;obvious&quot; to<br/>those of us who happen to be familiar with a given ratio.</p><p>Thus I could have and should have noted that 21:34, a supraminor<br/>sixth, has a size of around 834.17 cents; this would help people place<br/>it more easily on the continuum of intervals.</p><p>----------------------<br/>2. When cents are best<br/>----------------------</p><p>A great advantage of using cents as a common measurement, whatever our<br/>views on integer ratios large and small, is that they permit accurate<br/>description while leaving people to analysis or &quot;editorialize&quot; on<br/>possible associations with such ratios as they wish.</p><p>For example, in one of the articles prompting this dialogue, I<br/>borrowed a very creative system of Gene Ward Smith and proposed a kind<br/>of matrix to show some of the main &quot;interval families&quot; or &quot;flavors&quot;<br/>available in a given neo-Gothic tuning, with the number of fifths<br/>producing a representative interval in each family shown along with<br/>the size of the interval in cents.</p><p>While Gene is in no way responsible for what some might fairly call my<br/>&quot;barbarization&quot; of his system -- any more than the ancient Greeks are<br/>responsible for the interpretations of their modes offered in the<br/>medieval treatises -- this notation may show the advantages of using<br/>cents as the descriptive unit of measure.</p><p>For example, let us consider the &quot;Noble Fifth&quot; temperament whose<br/>logarithmic division of the octave is given in Ervin Wilson&apos;s famous<br/>Scale Tree, and which was proposed last year by Keenan Pepper on this<br/>Tuning List. This is the regular temperament where the ratio between<br/>the whole-tone (two fifths up less an octave) and the chromatic<br/>semitone (seven fifths up less four octaves) is equal to the Golden<br/>Section, or Phi, approximately 1.618.[2]</p><p>Here the value of the fifth is approximately 704.096 cents -- and note<br/>that indeed I give the value in cents, not some rational approximation.<br/>Here an &quot;Interval Family Matrix&quot; for usual neo-Gothic purposes might<br/>look like this:</p><p>             [1(704.1),4(416.4),9(336.9),15(961.4)]</p><p>Here we have first the fifth, then the major third at ~416.4 cents,<br/>then the augmented second at ~336.9 cents, and then the narrow minor<br/>seventh at ~961.4 cents.</p><p>This notation leaves readers to make whatever rational associations<br/>they wish, or simply to say, &quot;These are the values in cents, and I&apos;d<br/>prefer to let them stand for themselves in defining this tuning.&quot;</p><p>Thus one person may take 416.4 cents as a close approximation of<br/>11:14, and another simply as a third some distance from either 4:5<br/>(~386.31 cents) or 7:9 (~435.08 cents), or as a given distance from an<br/>estimated point of maximum &quot;harmonic entropy&quot; around 422-423 cents, or<br/>whatever.</p><p>Similarly, someone might take 336.9 cents either as a close<br/>approximation of 14:17, or as something considerably different from<br/>either 5:6 (~315.64 cents) or 9:11 (~347.41 cents), etc.</p><p>The advantages of giving intervals in cents, _as well as_ offering<br/>possible interpretations in a given style or theoretical outlook, may<br/>be even more dramatically illustrated if we consider the family of<br/>intervals in this tuning formed by chains of 13, 14, and 15 fifths up<br/>or down.</p><p>Here the matrix may not be the most informative one, giving only the<br/>narrow minor seventh at ~961.4 cents, which seems in the general<br/>vicinity of 4:7 (~968.83 cents). Unless one calculates the related<br/>large major third and small minor third based on the size of the<br/>fifth, however, one could overestimate the overall affinity to pure<br/>ratios of 7.</p><p>A fuller &quot;family portrait&quot; of this group of intervals might read:</p><p>             [-13(446.8),14(257.3),15(961.4)]</p><p>This makes it clear that the large major third is actually<br/>considerably wider than 7:9, actually somewhat closer to something<br/>like 10:13 (~454.21 cents), the area of &quot;ambiguity&quot; between the<br/>general categories of &quot;large major third&quot; and &quot;small fourth.&quot;</p><p>Giving a value in cents, 446.8, lets the reader decide how to<br/>interpret this -- and whether, for example, the possible &quot;RI&quot; category<br/>of 17:22 (~446.36 cents) might be helpful in describing this region<br/>somewhere between 7:9 and 10:13.</p><p>Similarly, the small minor third at around 257.3 cents might have a<br/>quality rather like that of a 6:7 (~266.87 cents) for some listeners,<br/>and identifying the interval in cents leaves the reader free to make<br/>an assessment.</p><p>For some purposes, it might also be interesting to offer larger<br/>rational approximations, but these should supplement rather than<br/>replace the convenient and objective measure of cents.</p><p>-----------------------------------------<br/>3. The continuum, mediants, and diversity<br/>-----------------------------------------</p><p>In my view, a vital factor in the musical experience is categorical<br/>perception, the tendency to group intervals into certain familiar or<br/>not-so-familiar categories or regions which may be defined by the<br/>theory and practice of a given style.</p><p>Such categories are different ways of viewing a free continuum, and it<br/>is understandable and proper that different people here will attach<br/>significant to different kinds of categories, whether articulated as<br/>integer ratios, as ranges in cents, or as names such as &quot;neutral<br/>seventh&quot; or &quot;supraminor sixth.&quot;</p><p>One use for &quot;RI&quot; ratios is to give names for certain conceptual<br/>categories of intervals, to emblematize them if one will, without<br/>necessarily implying that they are discrete &quot;harmonic entropy minima&quot;<br/>or &quot;valleys&quot; or the like, as opposed to arbitrary points of reference<br/>on the continuum.</p><p>One approach for doing this might be suggested by Erv Wilson&apos;s Scale<br/>Tree, taken as a table of interval ratios -- and also to be read as a<br/>table of logarithmic divisions of the octave, with both readings<br/>included within this admirable structure of numerical poetry.</p><p>For example, suppose we start with 5:6 and 9:11, the simplest ratio<br/>for a &quot;minor third&quot; and a typical ratio for a &quot;neutral third.&quot;</p><p>Finding the mediant of these two thirds, we get 14:17, the &quot;supraminor<br/>third&quot; of Manuel Op de Coul&apos;s Scala program and also of neo-Gothic<br/>theory. This is not necessarily a discrete &quot;valley&quot; -- the status of a<br/>sonority like 14:17:21 (~0-336-702 cents) as a three-voice combination<br/>maybe being open to further research and discussion -- but may serve<br/>as a nice emblem of the &quot;supraminor third&quot; category.</p><p>Suppose we repeat the process again with 5:6 and 14:17, getting 19:23,<br/>or around 330.76 cents. This ratio is yet more complex, and thus<br/>evidently more like a &quot;tempering by ratio&quot; than a discrete aural<br/>relationship of partials, yet it also may have a useful emblematic<br/>role relating to a very beautiful tuning.</p><p>In 29-tET, as it happens, the augmented second of ~331.03 cents is<br/>very close to this ratio, and may be taken as either a highly tempered<br/>form of 5:6, or an interval approaching the &quot;supraminor&quot; category<br/>found in the general vicinity of 14:17 (another emblem, not<br/>necessarily a discrete point).</p><p>What we have here are rather like multiple compass points, enriching<br/>the lore of the continuum without in any way constraining our<br/>exploration of it. We can articulate &quot;subcategories&quot; in a certain<br/>numerical way, but the continuum itself and its musical beauty<br/>outraces our efforts to categorize it in any event.</p><p>One thing RI ratios may also symbolize, in my view, is an interest<br/>among some participants here in portions of the continuum not always<br/>given the most prominent recognition in much &quot;conventional&quot; theory,<br/>even conventional xenharmonic theory.</p><p>Sometimes one might guess that the basic disagreements between<br/>xenharmonicists focus on whether a certain set of more or less agreed<br/>upon ratios should be kept pure, or may be tempered by a few cents (or<br/>sometimes more) for certain purposes.</p><p>The &quot;subversive&quot; feature of using RI ratios as one optional approach<br/>in describing a temperament may be, not that they exclude specifying<br/>interval sizes in cents or recognizing irrational temperaments as a<br/>fundamental concept and process, but that they tend to &quot;level&quot; the<br/>primacy of certain small integer ratios over large ones.</p><p>In short, the &quot;problem&quot; may be not that they prevent one from<br/>recognizing a continuum, but that they imply a worldview where the<br/>small ratios as well as the large ones are possible points on this<br/>continuum rather than necessarily the primary or preferred ones -- a<br/>question which may vary from style to style.</p><p>Here I would conclude by advising newcomers, as they may learn from<br/>reading a sample of current and past messages, that my views are<br/>likely minority ones, and that becoming acquainted with the range of<br/>musical outlooks and styles pursued here is the best approach in<br/>evaluating this issues.</p><p>-----<br/>Notes<br/>-----</p><p>1. Some people may have mixed feeling about using the specific<br/>logarithmic measure of cents, since for them it tends to imply the<br/>supremacy of 12-tET, and there may propose other units such as &quot;mils&quot;<br/>(thousanths of an octave), but this is a different kind of issue than<br/>the utility of some logarithmic measurement.</p><p>2. The &quot;Noble Fifth&quot; tuning is a counterpart of Kornerup&apos;s Golden<br/>Meantone, where Phi defines the ratio between whole-tone and diatonic<br/>semitone.</p><p>Most appreciatively,</p><p>Margo Schulter<br/><a href="mailto:mschulter@value.net">mschulter@value.net</a></p></div>
