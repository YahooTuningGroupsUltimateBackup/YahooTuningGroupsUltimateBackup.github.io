I easily get tired with words I am not familiar with and I<br/>shy away from non-traditional tunings because of my reading<br/>disabilities. I find non traditional music fascinating.

The Music Of DNA. For some reason, I was guided to this<br/>article. Just last week I was presenting a music lesson to some EMD<br/>students(special ed.students)and I was talking about the vary same<br/>thing about music being inside our bodies and in our DNA makeup.<br/>Further, I said,that music is all around us from the conception of<br/>birth to our present influences of walkmans,dentists offices,stores,<br/>good ol&apos; Mother Earth herself and Father Time. I presented myself by<br/>saying that music is like the theory of God and all others concepts<br/>thereof. Meaning,that our outer universe to our inner universe of our<br/>bodies are being guided by some kind of force. If you like to call it<br/>God,that will work for me or if want to call it science that too will<br/>work. Furthermore, I said, that music is our emotions of our body<br/>language. No matter what musical scale we were playing or what<br/>instruments, we could control it with our senses, depending on which<br/>ones were developed.(either normally or not) I could sense they<br/>understood what I was saying. Using emotions as, happy, sad, mad,<br/>crazy and lazy. I asked them too play a variety of emotions. I asked<br/>what kind of vibe to you get from these emotions. I also asked them,<br/>did you feel emotion through your body? I was very suprised to find<br/>that they could relate to this kind of explanation verses a<br/>traditional music theory training.(12 and 13 year olds) We later<br/>tried playing music with thoughts of clouds, rain, hot sun and etc. I<br/>could sense some were frustrated trying to relate to this kind of<br/>lesson, so I asked them to play how they felt.(We were using the<br/>Hohner Bluesband harmonica) I wasn&apos;t convinced they were mad enough<br/>about being intimidated with learning my teachings, so I presented<br/>myself with being mad and crazy, trying to emulate exactly the tones<br/>they played. The class was now crazy as I was and we all played in a<br/>frenzy of different musical harmonica cliches. Now, we tried our hand<br/>at immitating our favorite musical performer. Rap singer, guitarists<br/>and of course someone immitated me. Again the class was crazy for<br/>awhile. As you can guess, I am interested in muiscal that has<br/>relationship to the senses. Perhaps in accerated learning and some<br/>emotional healing as well. Again I ask do any of you know of any<br/>other further studies in &quot;The Music of DNA&quot;?

In my early years of music before I became<br/>a traditionalist, I was into Indian music and anything that resembled<br/>the microtonal scales. It entriqued me to think that someone could<br/>actually pinpoint a melodic tone for DNA substance. There were only<br/>four mentioned. When I was younger I read and did a thesis on the<br/>Doctrine of Ethos. I have always had a light shinning for this area<br/>of music. Although, I know this group talks about the ET and other<br/>alternative tunings for compositional purposes and listening<br/>pleasure, I thought there would be someone who could lead me to find<br/>some more information on this subject of DNA music. I just recently<br/>reasearched a beginning and found that if I wanted to learn more,<br/>there was a  lecture offered in California, I think the Bay area.<br/>That&apos;s a little far off for me right now. I am still teaching in<br/>school at this moment.

Verses 27-38 of Section 3 of chapter I of Sangita-ratnakara (a treatise from the 13th century), written by Sharngadeva, deal with the shruti-s, their classes, and their distribution among swara-s (notes). According to this, there are five classes of shruti-s: (1) dipta [pronounced deeptaa], meaning blazing, brilliant; (2) ayata [pronounced aayataa], meaning spread over, extended; (3) karuna [pronounced karuNaa], meaning compassion, pathos; (4) mrudu, meaning tender; and (5) madhyaa, meaning moderate, medium.</p><p>The combination of these classes found in each note:<br/>Sa: all except #3; Re: all except #1 &amp; #2; Ga: only #1 &amp; #2 present; Ma: all except #3; Pa: all except #1; Dha: all except #1 &amp; #4; Ni: only #1 &amp; #5 present.</p><p>The significance of this classification has not been studied as far as we know, and so least understood.</p><p>Regards,<br/>Haresh.</p></div><h3>Afmmjr@aol.com</h3><span>4/14/2005 10:07:37 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Dear Haresh,</p><p>What a wonderful organizing principle.  Knowing that there were &quot;extras&quot;<br/>available in playing the different Ragas, they had to be accounted for.  The<br/>natural qualities of the tonic Sa would seem to curtail any extra pitches in its<br/>bandwidth that could exemplify compassion or pathos (#3 or Karuna in the shruti<br/>descriptions).  Likewise Pa, being the dominant 3/2, could not provide for a<br/>microtone that is &quot;blazing, brilliant&quot; as this would contradict the original<br/>purpose of the 3/2 so brilliantly poised in its relationship to 1/1, or Sa.  The<br/>Pa could simply not suffer the competition so anathema to its very being.</p><p>Thank you for providing this valuable information from this valuable treatise.</p><p>best, Johnny Reinhard</p><p>p.s. are you familiar with Baul music?</p></div><h3>Haresh BAKSHI &#x3C;hareshbakshi@hotmail.com&#x3E;</h3><span>4/16/2005 10:03:53 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Dear Johnny, yes, I enjoy listening to Baul music.
