I would like to clarify that handhorn players will attempt to adjust their tuning in any way possible but the instrument simply gives the harmonics.  The tones we use are the major tone 9:8 and the minor tone 10:9 as they occur most frequently in our mostly simple music from the eighteenth century.  Also I think the pianist Robert Levin uses meantone in his fortepiano CD&apos;s of Mozart.  I had only a brief chat when he was in Brisbane last year, but I think he said the notes on the CD mention the tuning system.</p><p>Cheers</p><p>Michael Hugh Dixon<br/><a href="mailto:MandLDixon@bigpond.com">MandLDixon@bigpond.com</a></p><p>-----Original Message-----<br/>From: <a href="mailto:DWolf77309@cs.com">DWolf77309@cs.com</a> &lt;<a href="mailto:DWolf77309@cs.com">DWolf77309@cs.com</a>&gt;<br/>To: <a href="mailto:tuning@onelist.com">tuning@onelist.com</a> &lt;<a href="mailto:tuning@onelist.com">tuning@onelist.com</a>&gt;<br/>Date: Monday, 13 September 1999 17:41<br/>Subject: AW.: [tuning] RE: Role of quarter tones in Arabic Music</p><p>&gt;From: <a href="mailto:DWolf77309@cs.com">DWolf77309@cs.com</a><br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<a href="mailto:PErlich@Acadian-Asset.com">PErlich@Acadian-Asset.com</a>:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;&lt;&lt;<br/>&gt; Have you seen meantone around the West lately? &gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;Sure.

The division of a(ny) major third, which is equal<br/>b.  The division of a(ny) specific octave, which is unequal<br/>c.  The transposition to a(ny) different key, which is equal<br/>d.

It seems, based on the above, that meantone  represented<br/>equal divisions in music in juxtaposition to irregular tuning  (Grammateus,<br/>Schlick, Tost, Werckmeister).  It may be that meantone and  irregular tuning<br/>were the two pillars of aesthetics, each with some  evolution.  In this sense,<br/>12-tet is a meantone descendent.</p><p>best, Johnny Reinhard</p><p>************************************** See what&apos;s new at <a href="http://www.aol.com">http://www.aol.com</a></p></div><h3><a id=73875 href="#73875">ðŸ”—</a>Afmmjr@aol.com</h3><span>10/14/2007 7:32:33 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Thank you, Margo, for your comments.</p><p>Margo: Lindley, forexample, emphasizes that Schlick&apos;s temperament would  have<br/>had at least<br/>what I&apos;d call a &quot;semi-Wolf&quot; at C#-G#/Ab, about 8-10 cents  wide, and<br/>which Schlick himself urges we avoid.</p><p>Johnny: It seems that there is a standard irregular tuning family, much  like<br/>the meantone family.  They commonly have 20 major and minor keys (such  as<br/>with Fischer).  This indicates there are 2 &quot;semi-wolves&quot; as you call  them.  I<br/>have seen the use of the term &quot;dog-fifths&quot; for these (for being  more tame than<br/>wolves...instead of howling, they merely bark).</p><p>Margo:  Finessing only one or two notes in 1/4-comma like G#/Ab or  Eb/D#, as<br/>described by Praetorius and<br/>advocated by Werckmeister for those not  interested in a circulating<br/>well-temperament, would be unlikely to repair the  Wolf fifth, although<br/>it might alleviate it a bit, say to something like  1/6-comma.</p><p>Johnny: I could not find this in Werckmeister&apos;s Musical Temperament, which  I<br/>have just typed out to put with a new book I have written on Bach&apos;s  tuning.<br/>Do you recall where you saw this?</p><p>Margo:  The Grammateus temperament is a bit different, because  that is<br/>primarily based on Pythagorean tuning with diatonic whole  tones<br/>divided into two equal semitones -- that is, each equal to  9:8^(1/2),<br/>or about 101.955 cents (e.g. F-F#-G); E-F and B-C are the<br/>usual  256:243 or 90.224 cents.</p><p>Johnny: Doesn&apos;t it have 20 keys only like other irregular tuning?</p><p>Margo:  Jorgensen considers this as circulating, with two fifths at  1/2<br/>Pythagorean comma narrow, or just on the verge of being Wolves by this<br/>definition.</p><p>Johnny: While modern ears might enjoy a bark or even a howl, the earliers<br/>(as opposed to the moderns) strictly avoided moving in their territory.   And we<br/>are speaking of improvisation, as composition strictly avoided the canine<br/>keys.  I must disagree with Jorgensen; there is no circulating without a<br/>circle, and that begins on paper with Werckmeister.</p><p>Margo:  Maybe, like Schlick&apos;s, it could be<br/>called  &quot;semi-circulating&quot; -- but not necessarily by intent, as far as I<br/>know.  Dowland&apos;s irregular lute tuning is also interesting, and that has<br/>at least  one Wolf fifth, as I recall.</p><p>Johnny: Dowland&apos;s tuning has different pitch distinctions for the same<br/>pitch, making it an irregular irregular tuning.  As a lute tuning that does  not<br/>need to make a full circle, it may best be categorized as a different can of<br/>beans.</p><p>What do you think?</p><p>best, Johnny</p><p>************************************** See what&apos;s new at <a href="http://www.aol.com">http://www.aol.com</a></p></div>
