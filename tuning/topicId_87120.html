The pitches are Pythagorean, with C# situated an apotome below<br/>D. Bear in mind that the diapason is different from the international<br/>standard and the note names do not correspond to their piano key<br/>equivalents.</p><p>Nishabureyn is a terkib, or composite, which requires the modulation<br/>of Nishabur one semitone above perde buselik. One starts the maqam<br/>transposed to perde chargah (C) and modulates down to Nishabur on<br/>perde buselik (B) which is the finalis. I believe no one prior to me<br/>utilized a composite like this. It is quite difficult to handle I&apos;ll<br/>say!</p><p>The usul of the piece is called &quot;Devr-i Aryan&quot;, which is a 7/8 meter<br/>variant I innovated and different from the established Devr-i Hindi<br/>and Devr-i Turan usuls in the same meter in that, it pertains to the<br/>2+3+2 beat configuration rather than 3+2+2 or 2+2+3. I believe I&apos;m the<br/>first to use this configuration in Turkish Maqam music.</p><p>The Nishabureyn pesrev can be heard here:</p><p><a href="http://www.ozanyarman.com/musics.html">http://www.ozanyarman.com/musics.html</a></p><p>I employed Omer Tulgan&apos;s Hamparsum Nota 2.2 program written in Java<br/>for engraving and converting the music to MIDI. From the MIDI file, I<br/>recorded a digital performance under Logic Pro 8 and gave the music a<br/>&quot;classical&quot; feel. Without Nota 2.2, a few minutes&apos; work of microtonal<br/>tuning of the pitches could have taken days. Tulgan&apos;s software automatically bends the notes to AEU pitches.</p><p>The peshrev was written, as customary, according to the Mansur Ahenk<br/>and sounded in Bolahenk - that is, a perfect fifth higher. The Bendir<br/>samples in the background were obtained from the Usul-Velvele Editor<br/>designed by Ugur Kececioglu. This program&apos;s sample-generated beat were<br/>recorded and applied to the pertinent tracks in Logic.</p><p>Because the peshrev exceeds 5 minutes even in this moving pace,<br/>Kececioglu and I dubbed this compositional form a &quot;concert peshrev&quot;.<br/>This denomination signifies the need to devote more than the usual<br/>rehearsal-time to execute the work properly.</p><p>Other maqams and usuls used in the composition are not divulged at<br/>this stage. You may like to decipher the score as you listen to the<br/>music. The score can be downloaded as a PDF from the above link. Feel<br/>free to ask me any time about the other maqams and usuls!</p><p>Cordially,<br/>Oz.</p><p>&#x2729; &#x2729; &#x2729;<br/><a href="http://www.ozanyarman.com">www.ozanyarman.com</a></p><p>&#x2729; &#x2729; &#x2729;<br/><a href="http://www.ozanyarman.com">www.ozanyarman.com</a></p></div><h3>Chris Vaisvil &#x3C;chrisvaisvil@...&#x3E;</h3><span>3/31/2010 9:19:37 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>This is awesome Oz, very nice piece, lovely melody and top notch production!</p><p>Chris</p><p>On Tue, Mar 30, 2010 at 10:28 PM, Ozan Yarman &lt;ozanyarman@...&gt;wrote:</p><p>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Dear members,<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I have composed a new piece, strictly in the Classical Turkish music<br/>&gt; paradigm, adhering completely to the Arel-Ezgi-Uzdilek tone-system (24-<br/>&gt;</p></div><h3>Ozan Yarman &#x3C;ozanyarman@...&#x3E;</h3><span>3/31/2010 12:28:48 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Thanks Chris!
