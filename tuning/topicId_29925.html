In 31-EDO, a chain of 31 fifths is precisely equivalent<br/>to 18 pure octaves, so that the system has exact mathematical closure.</p><p>&quot;In 1/4-comma meantone, 31 tempered fifths would fall short of 18 pure<br/>octaves by about 6.07 cents. To achieve a &apos;musically closed&apos; 31-note<br/>cycle, we actually tune a chain of 30 fifths or 31 notes within an<br/>octave, then tuning the octave of the starting note to complete the<br/>cycle.</p><p>&quot;This results in an &apos;odd&apos; 31st fifth about 6.07 cents larger than the<br/>others -- as it happens, very close to a pure 3:2, since this<br/>adjustment of 6.07 cents almost exactly counterbalances the usual<br/>temperament of the fifth by 1/4-comma (about 5.38 cents) in the narrow<br/>direction.</p><p>&quot;Apart from producing this one near-just fifth, our 31-note cycle of<br/>1/4-comma meantone also produces a few major or minor thirds differing<br/>by about 6.07 cents from their usual sizes, a much smaller variation<br/>than that routinely tolerated in 18th-century well-temperaments.</p><p>&quot;This slight disparity between 31-EDO and 1/4-comma meantone means<br/>that the latter has two slightly different sizes for intervals where<br/>the former has a single unvarying size. For example, the neutral third<br/>of 31-EDO is always precisely 9/31 octave, or about 348 cents (in<br/>comparison to a just 11:9 at about 347 cents).  In a 31-note cycle of<br/>1/4-comma meantone, however, we find two slightly differing sizes of<br/>neutral thirds at about 345 cents and 351 cents.</p><p>&quot;These differences are generally quite minor, so that either system<br/>makes a fine 31-note circulating tuning for music where this variety<br/>of meantone temperament is desired.</p><p>&quot;In fact, just how the 31-note meantone cycles used on the instruments<br/>of Nicola Vicentino (1555) and Fabio Colonna (1618) were tempered is<br/>an open question. Both musicians describe a division of the whole-tone<br/>into five dieses, which would be precisely equal in 31-EDO. However,<br/>tuning by ear, a 1/4-comma temperament based on pure 5:4 major thirds<br/>might be easier to judge than the very slight impurity of these thirds<br/>in the wide direction required for a precise 31-EDO. Very possibly the<br/>variations from theoretical interval sizes in practice would have been<br/>greater than the mathematical differences between the two models.&quot;</p><p>On the theoretical possibility of carrying 1/4-comma meantone beyond<br/>31 notes:</p><p>&quot;While 1/4-comma meantone makes a 31-note circulating system very<br/>similar to 31-EDO, one could in principle carry the chain of regular<br/>tempered fifths further. The 31st fifth of such a chain would generate<br/>a step about 6.07 cents lower than the starting note. As one continued<br/>this process, a series of 31-note sets would result, each about 6.07<br/>cents lower than the previous one, generating new steps and interval<br/>sizes.&quot;</p><p>On the &quot;Wolf fifth/fourth&quot;:</p><p>&quot;A basic feature of 31-EDO or 1/4-comma meantone, as well as many<br/>other types of tunings, is that notes such as G# and Ab are _not_<br/>equivalent. The difference between such notes in either tuning is<br/>known as an &apos;enharmonic diesis&apos;: 1/31 octave (~38.71 cents) in 31-EDO,<br/>or 128:125 (~41.06 cents) in 1/4-comma.</p><p>&quot;An important musical consequence of this difference is that a<br/>diminished sixth such as G#-Eb is _not_ the same interval as a regular<br/>fifth such as G#-D# or Ab-Eb, but rather in usual historical European<br/>timbres a drastically more &apos;beatful&apos; and dissonant interval a diesis<br/>larger. This beating is said to have resembled the howling of wolves,<br/>thus the term &apos;Wolf fifth.&apos;</p><p>&quot;In 31-EDO, where a usual fifth is 18/31 octave (~696.77 cents), a<br/>Wolf fifth such as G#-Eb is 19/31 octave (~735.48 cents). In<br/>1/4-comma, similarly, a regular fifth is about 696.58 cents, but a<br/>Wolf fifth about 737.65 cents -- a 128:125 diesis larger.</p><p>&quot;Likewise an interval such as Eb-G# in either tuning forms a &apos;Wolf<br/>fourth&apos; a diesis narrower than a usual fourth at 13/31 octave in<br/>31-EDO (~503.23 cents), or about 503.42 cents in 1/4-comma -- 12/31<br/>octave (~464.52 cents) in 31-EDO, or about 462.35 cents in 1/4-comma.</p><p>&quot;Generally avoided in historical European music, the Wolf fifth is<br/>nevertheless sometimes used as a &apos;special effect&apos; where an especially<br/>striking and expressive dissonance is desired.</p><p>&quot;Wolf fifths or fourths will occur in any 12-note or larger tuning set<br/>of 31-EDO or 1/4-comma meantone, where they are found between notes at<br/>a distance of 11 fifths or fourths on the chain, e.g. G#-Eb or Eb-G#.</p><p>&quot;The &apos;Wolf problem,&apos; as it is sometimes called, might be taken to<br/>relate not so much to the presence of these intervals as to the<br/>absence of regular fifths or fourths for certain steps of a tuning set<br/>which is not large enough to supply these usual concords.</p><p>&quot;Specifically, in a 12-note tuning of 31-EDO or 1/4-comma meantone<br/>such as the chain of fifths from Eb to G# typical of the 16th century,<br/>we find a Wolf fifth or fourth G#-Eb or Eb-G# between the extreme<br/>notes of the chain, but no regular fifth G#-D# or Ab-Eb.</p><p>&quot;The problem, if we seek such fifths, is that our tuning set does not<br/>include the note D# or Ab. For most 16th-century keyboard and also<br/>vocal music, where accidentals typically remain in the range of Eb-G#,<br/>this &apos;problem&apos; is mostly academic.</p><p>&quot;However, for more adventurous music, some 16th-18th century meantone<br/>keyboards provide the additional notes for such regular fifths, for<br/>example using &quot;split-key&quot; accidentals with the front portion of a<br/>black key provides G# and the back portion Ab, or likewise Eb and D#.<br/>On such a keyboard, we still find the Wolf fifth G#-Eb, but also now<br/>the regular fifths Ab-Eb and G#-D#.</p><p>&quot;To get a circulating version of 31-EDO or 1/4-comma meantone where<br/>_all_ steps have usual fifths or fourths, we need to tune a 31-note<br/>cycle; now these intervals, and also Wolf fifths or fourths, are<br/>available for each step.&quot;</p><p>Most appreciatively,</p><p>Margo Schulter<br/><a href="mailto:mschulter@value.net">mschulter@value.net</a></p></div><h3><a id=30005 href="#30005">ðŸ”—</a>monz &#x3C;joemonz@yahoo.com&#x3E;</h3><span>11/7/2001 1:25:38 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>&gt; From: &lt;<a href="mailto:jpehrson@rcn.com">jpehrson@rcn.com</a>&gt;<br/>&gt; To: &lt;<a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>&gt;<br/>&gt; Sent: Wednesday, November 07, 2001 10:10 AM<br/>&gt; Subject: [tuning] Re: 31-EDO and 1/4-comma meantone compared<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; --- In tuning@y..., &quot;monz&quot; &lt;joemonz@y...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; <a href="/tuning/topicId_29925.html#29925">/tuning/topicId_29925.html#29925</a><br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; For those interested in 1/4-comma meantone and/or 31-EDO:<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; I&apos;ve just made a significant update to the Tuning Dictionary<br/>&gt; &gt; entry for 1/4-comma meantone:<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; <a href="http://www.ixpres.com/interval/dict/1-4cmt.htm">http://www.ixpres.com/interval/dict/1-4cmt.htm</a><br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; The link for &quot;vector addition&quot; there gets me a &quot;404 not found...&quot;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Not that I could master that in an afternoon....</p><p>Thanks, Joe.
