But the trumpet players will try to fight it, since moving<br/>away from the center of the resonance will not only impair the tone<br/>quality, but also the ability to nail the next note. The lead (for<br/>whom this is the most crucial, and who has the hardest time anyway)<br/>will adapt the least, the lowest voice the most. If the chord is<br/>held for some time, everyone will try to adapt as little as possible<br/>and consider the chord strenuous.</p><p>(Now adapting a different approach from Kami&apos;s, stopping all them<br/>note name references :). Also a best case scenario.)</p><p>To a sophisticated player, the key signature and accidentals make<br/>clear what the 10 in the chord is: the third of a short dominant 7<br/>b9. If it is THE dominant (in which case Kami&apos;s spelling would be<br/>quite confusing), it will be the 15/8 of the key scale. Either they<br/>play it as a fifth partial (which also means that the 12 - second<br/>degree of the scale - is on the third or sixth), or they know they<br/>can and should relax a bit there. The 14 will be spelled like the<br/>4th scale degree. You&apos;ll have to argue the player into lipping this<br/>one down a lot or playing it in a &quot;forbidden&quot; way (7th partial) (I&apos;m<br/>of the 7-is-consonant-and-won&apos;t-do-for-a-dominant-7th conviction<br/>myself). I won&apos;t say anything about the 17 (not much adjustment<br/>needed - and it will somehow float with the other frequencies). Yes,<br/>it is possible if the spelling makes sense and you analyse the chord<br/>for the players (who all get to see only one note of the chord) -<br/>and if it is voiced so that the top note can be played right on<br/>center (which is probably true enough for the 17).</p><p>Klaus</p></div>
