That is,<br/>+1 -2 +17 etc.</p><p>&gt; What I&apos;m trying to get across/emphasize is that this proves<br/>&gt; that what is stylistically neutral is much more discontinuous<br/>&gt; than most western music (or at least western classical music),<br/>&gt; there being no occurence of successive intervals going in the<br/>&gt; same direction for more than 2 places in succession.</p><p>I guess I&apos;d say everything is a &quot;style&quot;.  It is true that<br/>most music falls somewhere between random and repetitive, but<br/>I&apos;m not sure what this has to do with the price of tea in<br/>China.  Testing scales meant for new music by evaluating<br/>how existing music sounds in them is a mistake, but I doubt<br/>Morse-Thue sequences are in any way more universal.  One has<br/>to compose music appropriate for the scale, and probably<br/>there is appropriate music for every scale.</p><p>That said, it might be interesting to have a method of<br/>generating melodies in every scale as a point of comparison.<br/>Random melodies may be good for this.  1/f noise also.<br/>And chromatic runs too.  And Morse-Thue sequences.</p><p>But any such method based on the chromatic step will give<br/>results more or less dominated by the size of the chromatic<br/>step -- larger ETs will sound micro, and smallor ones macro.<br/>Chain-of-best-fifth scales like the diatonic scale will<br/>sound more similar across tunings.  And so the most powerful<br/>overall approach IMO would be to identify scale archtypes<br/>in advance (diatonic, octatonic, &quot;mavila&quot;, etc.) and listen<br/>to how they change as the size of their generator is changed.<br/>And indeed, much discussion here involves this sort of thing.</p><p>-Carl</p></div>
