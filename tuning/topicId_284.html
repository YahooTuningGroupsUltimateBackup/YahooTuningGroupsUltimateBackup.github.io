I saved it and rebooted (for unrelated reasons) and when I got<br/>back it doesn&apos;t seem to have been saved.  Weird.</p><p>   But anyway, here&apos;s the quick summary of the responses:<br/>1.  Only one or two or three programs had more than one person using<br/>    it.  We appear to be a very varied bunch.<br/>2.  One of the programs that had more than one user was Netscape, but<br/>    almost all of the rest, best I&apos;m aware anyway, are just plain ol&apos; ASCII</p><p>    text Email programs.  So it&apos;s not surprising now that you folks aren&apos;t<br/>    interested in a HTML supplementary list.<br/>3.  Surprisingly few replies came from PC users - about half.  Lots of<br/>    Unix and Mac hacks among us.</p><p>   Thanks for the responses.  Sorry I lost the specific tally.</p></div><h3>Eduardo Sabat-Garibaldi &#x3C;esabat@xxxxxx.xxx.xxx&#x3E;</h3><span>2/19/1998 8:21:39 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Gary :<br/>From several months ago I m using Netscape.</p><p>Surprise !, I saw again your original message and I see a proto-line in<br/>the  c  lower case.<br/>What I see are two points attached to the c . One of them at the very<br/>top of the c and the other point in the lower and opposite part of the c<br/>. The inner part of the  c is empty like a normal  c . Sorry, about<br/>fifteen years ago I had an accident on my right globe eye and I loss the<br/>view. The size of the point is like the point placed up the normal  i ,<br/>but in this case the point is separated from the body of the letter and<br/>in the c both points are attached .</p><p>Eduardo</p></div>
