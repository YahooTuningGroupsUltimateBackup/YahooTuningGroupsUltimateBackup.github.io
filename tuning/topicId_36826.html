Can you draw<br/>the graph yourself?</p><p>4)Is there a software that allowas you to apply the<br/>volume dynamic (in any format) of a prerecorded to a<br/>constant volume prerecorded sound? Can you draw the<br/>graph yourself?</p><p>*So far I can tell you what I know, which is the Kyma<br/>software, but unfortunately this only deals with<br/>100KHz of sampling rate which is far behind from the<br/>SACD quality (196KHz) which is what I am looking for.</p><p>Many thanks in advance!!!</p><p>J.A.M.Salinas</p><p>__________________________________________________<br/>Do You Yahoo!?<br/>Yahoo!

It&apos;s debatable, and somewhat<br/>academic, whether SACD is better than 96KHz PCM.</p><p>Being fully programmable, Kyma should be able to do all<br/>of the things you asked for; I don&apos;t know if it does them<br/>out of the box.</p><p>-Carl<br/>Garberville, California.</p></div>
