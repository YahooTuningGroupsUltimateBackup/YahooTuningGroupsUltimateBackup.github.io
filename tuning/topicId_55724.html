There is nothing awkward about Bx; it&apos;s a Pythagorean comma higher than C#, which in turn is a Pyth comma higher than Db.  What&apos;s the problem?  :)</p><p>The &quot;awkwardness&quot; here comes from thinking inside the paradigm of 1/4 comma instead of the lighter meantone schemes.  [Been there, done that; I had a very long period of 1/4 comma enthusiasm myself, in both its pure and many modified forms, until its vicissitudes finally annoyed me enough to switch.]</p><p>Tosi (c1646-1732), writing in 1723 near the end of his long career, instructed singers to preserve that comma distinction in pitch; this was nothing new.  It&apos;s normal to 1/6 syntonic comma meantone; each time around the circle, we gain or lose a Pyth comma.  No big whoop, once the sound is in the ears, and it&apos;s sitting right there on any ordinary 1/6 comma meantone keyboard.  That&apos;s why he and some contemporaries found it easiest to present the 55edo model, as a way of explaining this already common-practice stuff to the mathematically less astute.  A tone is built of 9 pieces of 55edo; a chromatic semitone is 4 pieces and a diatonic semitone is the other 5.  It&apos;s 1/6 comma meantone, plain and simple, in terms that people could understand without knowing fractions.  And those little pieces themselves are essentially the comma anyway, so it all boils down to differentiating enharmonics by one comma each, with only the simplest integer arithmetic.  If the music says A# in the vocal part, sing that note one comma below the keyboard&apos;s Bb.  That puts your A# at 392 cents against F#: the normal size of major thirds in common everyday meantone tuning (all the correctly-spelled major thirds on the keyboard having that everyday sound of 392 cents).  [The sensitive keyboardist doesn&apos;t insist on playing a competing Bb there against the proper A#, being off by a comma!  F#-Bb is still a wolf diminished fourth.]</p><p>I&apos;ve also seen references to 45/32 in an Italian keyboard document from 1676, but I can&apos;t say more for sure until I&apos;ve got better copies from the microfilm to be sure I&apos;m seeing what I think I&apos;m seeing in it; suffice it to say that 1/6 comma was already a norm.  It sounds perfectly fine, really wonderful, as long as one sticks to notes that are spelled correctly!</p><p>Werckmeister&apos;s shtick c1690 was to offer ways to convert the old-fashioned and restricted 1/6 comma meantone into more circulating methods: keeping the axis C and F# where they were (near 45/32) and moving the other notes up or down.  &quot;Werckmeister III&quot; keeps four notes very near their 1/6 comma positions (C, F#, and slightly raised B and lowered G).  His IV keeps five notes (Bb, C, D, E, F#) of 1/6 comma and fusses around with the other seven.  His V is a squared-off version of 1/8 comma meantone, de-regularizing it.  All three of these were low-budget methods to convert existing organs out of everyday meantone, making minimal changes to the pipes (and mostly flatward: i.e. adding material to existing pipes if necessary, to lower the pitch a little bit, but not cutting into existing pipes to shorten them).  [The addition of material is a somewhat reversible procedure, but cutting isn&apos;t....]</p><p>Werckmeister&apos;s musical choices in IV and especially in III have done so much unfortunate violence to tonal music, both from 1690-c1775 and c1960 to now...all (at the root of it) from keeping the F# as low as 45/32!  So many of the notes, frankly, are grossly flat...sort of like the sound of unsupported singing by a weak choir.  Instead of seeking to overturn the classic meantone restrictions for 12-key keyboards, with anything more ideal for music, he merely duct-taped over the most obvious problems without really solving them.  Then those who have emulated his work (because it was so widely influential and fashionable) fell into the same silly traps, not perceiving the underlying shapes and issues well enough.</p><p>It&apos;s been even worse with the taking of his 1/4 comma prescriptions (in III) as any strong theoretical endorsement of 1/4 C per se, instead of recognizing it as a bastardized version of 1/6.  1/4 was already out of the picture by that point.  &quot;Werckmeister III&quot; is basically &quot;squaring off your 1/6 C meantone with as many pure fifths as possible, For Dummies and for churches unwilling to invest in a complete overhaul&quot;...without really extending the range of usable keys at all, but merely watering down their offensiveness in some musical situations.  In W-III and its offshoots one is still stuck within the Eb to G# set of 12 notes; all he did was to make the sorties outside that range a bit less garish.  Ab, Db, Gb, and Cb are the big losers, but D# and A# and E# are pretty rotten, too.</p><p>As Werckmeister himself cleared up later, 12edo and its sound-alikes are better for music than those stopgap conversion-solutions are; but some threads of music history got too stuck on [misinterpretations of] his publications of the 1690s.  And the three temperaments of his colleague Bendeler, also from c1690, are musically more advantageous anyway, as for playing music that circulates into the weirder enharmonics.  Bendeler just hasn&apos;t had the entourage and household-name status that big W has.  (Anybody ever seen an electronic tuner that has the excellent &quot;Bendeler III&quot; pre-programmed into it?)</p><p>I have more to say about this, sometime, but this isn&apos;t the time and place for it.</p><p>Brad Lehman</p></div><h3><a id=55725 href="#55725">ðŸ”—</a>Brad Lehman &#x3C;bpl@umich.edu&#x3E;</h3><span>8/20/2004 2:19:52 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, I &lt;bpl@u...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt; 1/5 comma meantone had yielded in common practice to 1/6 (having<br/>tritone at<br/>&gt; or near 45/32).

Furthermore, the pattern&apos;s not<br/>quite the same as Bendeler III anyway, even if we straighten out the<br/>spot where the narrow and wide fifths are neighboring.</p><p>Bendeler III (1690):<br/>Ab -1/4 Eb 0 Bb 0 F 0 C -1/4 G -1/4 D 0 A 0 E -1/4 B 0 F# 0 C# 0 G#</p><p>Werckmeister V (1691):<br/>Ab +1/4 Eb 0 Bb 0 F -1/4 C 0 G 0 D -1/4 A -1/4 E 0 B 0 F# -1/4 C#<br/>-1/4 G#</p><p>If we straighten out C# 0 G# 0 Eb there at the ends instead of having<br/>the G# lowered, and shift over by a whole tone, we still don&apos;t have a<br/>mapping onto the Bendeler.  There are different numbers of pure<br/>fifths in sequence.</p><p>=====</p><p>There is a Werckmeister/Bendeler connection elsewhere, though;<br/>&quot;Werckmeister III&quot; is a shaved version of &quot;Bendeler I&quot; using 1/4<br/>comma instead of 1/3.  (And &quot;Kellner&quot; fabricated in 1975 is a 1/5<br/>re-shaving of Werck III, and &quot;Barnes&quot; in 1979 is a 1/6 re-shaving of<br/>Kellner...all having a similar layout with one tempered fifth in B-F#<br/>and the rest in sequence in the naturals around C.  Barnes had also<br/>fooled around with an entirely different one, some years earlier.)  Of<br/>course Bendeler and Werckmeister knew one another; Bendeler was the<br/>cantor at Quedlinburg while Werckmeister was the organist.</p><p>Bendeler I:<br/>Ab 0 Eb 0 Bb 0 F 0 C -1/3 G -1/3 D 0 A 0 E 0 B -1/3 F# 0 C# 0 G#</p><p>Werckmeister III:<br/>Ab 0 Eb 0 Bb 0 F 0 C -1/4 G -1/4 D -1/4 A 0 E 0 B -1/4 F# 0 C# 0 G#</p><p>Kellner:<br/>Ab 0 Eb 0 Bb 0 F 0 C -1/5 G -1/5 D -1/5 A -1/5 E 0 B -1/5 F# 0 C# 0 G#</p><p>Barnes:<br/>Ab 0 Eb 0 Bb 0 F -1/6 C -1/6 G -1/6 D -1/6 A -1/6 E 0 B -1/6 F# 0 C#<br/>0 G#</p><p>Brad Lehman</p></div><h3><a id=55842 href="#55842">ðŸ”—</a>Manuel Op de Coul &#x3C;manuel.op.de.coul@eon-benelux.com&#x3E;</h3><span>8/25/2004 9:11:24 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>&gt;No, it&apos;s not.

Still if you transpose one of<br/>&gt; them by a tone, then 10 tones are exactly the same, and 2 differ<br/>&gt; by 1/4 P. comma.</p><p>True.  But that operation of tranposition by a tone makes a huge<br/>difference in *effect* vis-a-vis tonal music, reorganizing the<br/>relationships of the keys and any Affekt they might contribute to;<br/>and<br/>it moves almost all the placements of notes for everybody else<br/>(non-keyboard) who is trying to play and sing with it.</p><p>Granted, Bendeler III in Chorton would sound pretty much like<br/>Werckmeister V in Cammerton, much of the time.  But, string players<br/>would mutiny at the placement of tight 1/4 comma fifths in their<br/>D-A-E.  It makes their use of open strings unreliable.</p><p>And, in the operation mentioned above (comparing Bendeler III in D<br/>with Werckmeister V in C), Werckmeister has done two things typical<br/>for him: ruin the note Ab to give a calmer G# (thereby making Ab-C<br/>Pythagorean), and ruin E# to give a calmer F-A (thereby making C#-E#<br/>Pythagorean).  These are not improvements for the behavior of<br/>circulating tonal music; they&apos;re steps backward in quality for music<br/>that uses enharmonics.</p><p>It may not seem like such a big deal to crank F up a 1/4 comma, and<br/>G#<br/>down a 1/4 comma; but it is, in practical situations.  Every such<br/>move<br/>of dinking a single pitch up or down has repercussions in multiple<br/>other places, both in melody and harmony, because it&apos;s a closed<br/>system<br/>and all the pitches are doing multiple duty within complex<br/>relationships.  Each little move creates some equal and opposite<br/>reaction somewhere else.  Here, the motion of both F and G# creates a<br/>fourth (especially small) size of semitone where Bendeler had only<br/>three; and a fourth (especially large) size of tone where Bendeler<br/>had<br/>only three.  That stuff &quot;sticks out like sore thumbs&quot; on close<br/>hearing<br/>in melodic contexts, and in the playing of Db major and Ab major<br/>triads.
