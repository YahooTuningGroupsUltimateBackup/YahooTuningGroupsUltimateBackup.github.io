The Wilson<br/>fifth is the positive real root of x^4 - 2x - 2. It gives brats of -1,<br/>which is a particularly interesting value, and is a Perron number,<br/>meaning all of its conjugates are less than it in absolute value.

Since it is Perron the ratios of the corresponding linear<br/>recurrences converge, and from this and the power of two property we<br/>have metameantone.</p><p>Very similarly, x^9 - 4x - 8 gives us a Perron number which is a<br/>fourth which works well as a generator for schismic, and it also gives<br/>a brat of -1. It&apos;s just barely Perron, but it could be used for<br/>metaschismic if one were so inclined.</p></div><h3>Gene Ward Smith &#x3C;gwsmith@svpal.org&#x3E;</h3><span>9/2/2003 1:45:35 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;Gene Ward Smith&quot; &lt;gwsmith@s...&gt; wrote:</p><p>&gt; Very similarly, x^9 - 4x - 8 gives us a Perron number which is a<br/>&gt; fourth which works well as a generator for schismic, and it also<br/>gives<br/>&gt; a brat of -1.
