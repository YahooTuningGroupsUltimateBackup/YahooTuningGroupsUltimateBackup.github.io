I&apos;m not sure if this<br/>indicates some kind of a setup by which there are certain<br/>circumstances in which a mode can in fact be ordered, but if you stick<br/>a D in under any D# the above setup, it will actually sound almost<br/>extramodal. Perhaps modes can be sectioned off to different registers?</p><p>&gt; By historical development of European music it happened, that always<br/>&gt; middle of those three major and three minor scales was selected as<br/>&gt; &quot;main&quot; major and &quot;main&quot; minor for future use (golden middle way).<br/>&gt; Maybe European music would be much more contrasting if the most major<br/>&gt; and the most minor scales were selected (Lydian and Phrygian). But of<br/>&gt; course these scales were used in folklore and church music, and since<br/>&gt; 19th century again in common classical music.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Daniel Forro</p><p>Carl told me a while ago that they were chosen because they&apos;re the<br/>only modes that lie adjacent to a diminished fifth, which supposedly<br/>strengthens resolution to the tonic.

If this is your view of &quot;natural&quot; using of mode, stay with it. I don&apos;t see anything natural and typical for that mode in it, and nothing what&apos;s connected to modal harmony. :-) But in music everything is possible in the right context.<br/>&gt; Carl told me a while ago that they were chosen because they&apos;re the<br/>&gt; only modes that lie adjacent to a diminished fifth, which supposedly<br/>&gt; strengthens resolution to the tonic.<br/>&gt;<br/>I don&apos;t think this is the reason, as that diminished fifth is on different grades of both scales, and resolution is different. I have another hypothesis. I agree that there must be some connection to the functional harmony and of course also to the interval of diminished fifth. Because Ionian ending formula D7 - T has that diminished fifth in the first chord which is resolved. Lydian D7 - T has major 7th in the first chord, diminished fifth is missing (there&apos;s pure fifth between third and seventh in the first chord),  and mixolydian dominant has minor 7th chord, again without diminished fifth (it&apos;s again pure fifth). All this weaken power of that narrow Ionian resolution. So they selected Ionian.</p><p>For minor scales: Dorian and Aoelian has the same minor 7th chords as dominants, but Dorian has major subdominant, which sounded archaic. Besides Aeolian can be found on the 6th grade of Ionian as a mode of Ionian. And ending formula could be easily improved by using of major dominant chord, still it&apos;s not so narrow chromatic resolution as in Ionian. Phrygian couldn&apos;t use dominant chord at all, because it&apos;s diminished chord, so they have used II or VII grade resolved to major tonic, which sounds too exclusively. So from all those reasons probably they selected Aeolian.</p><p>Besides both Ionian and Aeolian were new scales not present in the original Middle Age system of 4 authentic and 4 plagal modes, and are adjacent to them on both sides (C - DEFG - A). And because starting only two distinct modes (but with all transpositions) would be still boring despite major/minor contrast, composers must learned how to used more chromatized tone terrain, and develop new ways of harmony - more rich than modal, based on new functional relations inside the newly defined tonality.</p><p>But who knows, I was not there those times...</p><p>Daniel  Forro</p></div>
