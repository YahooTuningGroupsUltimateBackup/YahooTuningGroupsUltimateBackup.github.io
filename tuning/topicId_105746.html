What would actually be a proper<br/>(and until someone writes software to do this, and tedious) approach is to<br/>shift the original pitch in the composition to the nearest quasi-equivalent<br/>pitch. Doing this would keep intact far more information - such as chord<br/>progressions. As an aid I put together a spreadsheet that attempts to<br/>identify equivalents - this is a first pass.
