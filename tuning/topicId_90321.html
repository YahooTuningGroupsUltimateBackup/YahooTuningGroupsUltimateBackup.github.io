Graham&apos;s scripts allow you to find one particular temperament either by combining two EDOs or by specifying which interval should vanish in that particular temperament, depending on whether you choose &quot;Temperament class from ETs&quot; or &quot;Unison vector search&quot;. Defining a temperament by the vanishing interval is a unique definition, tells you more about its possible application in actual music, and doesn&apos;t meaninglessly suggest larger scales than what&apos;s needed to actually use the temperament (which the ET search does if torsion occurs).</p><p>For example, I can get meantone by combining 7-EDO and 12-EDO but I can get exactly the same by combining 12-EDO and 19-EDO so it&apos;s up to me whether I call it &quot;7&amp;12&quot; or &quot;12&amp;19&quot;. What&apos;s more, this hardly tells me anything else than the fact that 7-EDO and 12-EDO are both usable as meantone (unless I had such good imagination to understand what 7-EDO and 12-EDO have in common).</p><p>If I wanted to define meantone, the most important fact for me (from a &quot;musical&quot; point of view) would probably be that a major third should be represented by 4 fifths minus 2 octaves or that a major sixth should be represented by 3 fifths minus an octave or something like that -- because, well, that&apos;s what makes it meantone. So, in 5-limit JI, a pure major third is 5/4, 4 pure fifths minus 2 octaves are 81/64, and therefore the interval which turns into unison in the resulting temperament is 81/80 -- i.e. (81/64) / (5/4). Similarly, a pure major sixth is 5/3, 3 fifths minus an octave are 27/16, and therefore the vanishing interval is again 81/80.<br/>If you then figure out the interval size for the period and the generator (which is exactly what Graham&apos;s &quot;Unison vector search&quot; does after you enter the vanishing interval), you get a temperament in which this is true.</p><p>However, the fact that &quot;a major third is the same as 4 fifths minus 2 octaves&quot; is not a &quot;given thing&quot; which should always be true, it&apos;s something which people &quot;agreed on&quot; during the 16th century. So you can actually take any target interval and represent it by a number of other intervals, which is what offers you the possibility of new harmonic systems and so on. That&apos;s why I&apos;ve given an example of hanson in my last message to show you what I mean. In hanson, the intervals which sounds like a &quot;fifth&quot; is represented by 6 &quot;sounding minor thirds&quot; minus an octave (I say &quot;sounding&quot; because their meanings in hanson are not quite the same). So, a fifth is 3/2, 6 minor thirds minus an octave are 23328/15625, and therefore the interval which turns into unison here is 15625/15552. If you go to Graham&apos;s &quot;Unison vector search&quot; and enter &quot;15625/15552&quot;, you get a temperament which uses minor thirds as generators and which approximates 3/1 by stacking six of these.</p><p>The reason why I was asking you about 34-EDO was that I deliberately chose an EDO which has good approximations to JI but isn&apos;t usable as meantone. If you never get to know something else than JI or meantone, you&apos;ll only understand 34-EDO as &quot;another way to approximate JI&quot; since &quot;it doesn&apos;t make meantone. But once you start discovering other temperaments, sooner or later, you notice that, for example, approximating 3/1 in 34-EDO takes exactly 6 times more steps than approximating 6/5 and therefore 34-EDO can be used as hanson. Interestingly enough, 19-EDO is the one which can be used both as meantone and as hanson.</p><p>Or another example.<br/>Let&apos;s say you&apos;re trying to find a tuning where 4 &quot;seconds&quot; make a usable fifth and where one &quot;second&quot; is close to the 5-limit &quot;narrow major second&quot; of 10/9 (so that you could get a major sixth using 5 of them and a major tenth using 9 of them). So, a fifth is 3/2, 4 narrow major seconds are 10000/6561, and therefore the interval which vanishes in the resulting temperament is 20000/19683. If you put this into Graham&apos;s &quot;Unison vector search&quot;, you get a temperament where this is true -- i.e. tetracot.<br/>Interestingly enough, in 34-EDO, 3/2 is approximated by 4 times more steps than 10/9, which means that not only can 34-EDO be used as hanson but it can also be used as tetracot -- you know what, that&apos;s why I&apos;ve picked an example of tetracot. :-D</p><p>In message #90305, I&apos;ve written the shortest understandable description of &quot;period&amp;generator mapping&quot; I could probably manage, so let&apos;s hope that helps.</p><p>Petr</p></div><h3>genewardsmith &#x3C;genewardsmith@...&#x3E;</h3><span>6/13/2010 3:58:47 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, Petr Par&iacute;zek &lt;p.parizek@...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Chris wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; So.. we are talking about overlaying two EDOs - capital idea!<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; That&apos;s one possible view on 2D tunings, not actually one I prefer.</p><p>For any rank of temperament, it has the advantage that you only need to stick in as many numbers as the rank.

If I were as &quot;unfamiliar&quot; as I was 4 years ago and you offered me 34-EDO and 19-EDO without suggesting anything, I think I would just see how &quot;mistuned&quot; their 2|3|5 approximations are and then simply add the numbers to get 53-EDO. But I would probably not realize what 34-EDO and 19-EDO have in common and therefore get hanson (unless I had some additional &quot;mathematical thoughts&quot; flowing in my head, which I certainly didn&apos;t have until I first tried to temper out something else than 81/80 within the 5-limit framework).</p><p>&gt; For five limit, which you talk about, that&apos;s still two whereas the comma &gt; approach only involves one comma,<br/>&gt; big advantage commas.

For me it&apos;s pretty logical that the more dimmensions I begin with (for the original untempered system), the more numbers I need for the mapping if I want to get a 2D result. If I don&apos;t stick to the requirement of full prime limit approximations, I can temper out 3136/3125 within the 2|5|7-limit space; if I do, I can either simply &quot;clamp the 3 on that&quot; and get a 3D result or find another comma to temper out and get a 2D result. But I think that some unison vectors best reveal their &quot;musical possibilities&quot; if you temper out only one at a time. For example, last year, I made a short piece in a 3D tuning which tempers out 4000/3993 within 2|3|5|11-limit JI. Now I&apos;m glad I wasn&apos;t tempering out anything else back then. Similarly, octacot or miracle may be fine, but the actual 3D version of &quot;breed&quot; suggest an even more efficient way to use the &quot;breedsma&apos;s&quot; possibilities, which one may not think of in the 2D tunings in the first place.
