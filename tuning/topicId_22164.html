I am very happy to be back online, and would clarify<br/>that in this post, &quot;within the last couple of weeks&quot; means &quot;around the<br/>middle of April.&quot;]</p><p>Hello, there, Joseph Pehrson, and thank you for some very helpful<br/>comments and questions.</p><p>Just as you say, actually playing a two-manual keyboard in a 24-note<br/>&quot;two-gear&quot; Pythagorean tuning is a much more effective introduction to<br/>this kind of system than anything I could write here.</p><p>By the way, thank you very much for mentioning my _Flugblatt_<br/>distributed at MicroFest, and I&apos;d like to express my warmest<br/>appreciation to Bill Alves for his pivotal role in making this and all<br/>other aspects of the conference possible.</p><p>Within the very modest limits of written prose and ASCII keyboard<br/>diagrams, maybe one way that I can share some &quot;Pythagorean biking&quot;<br/>ideas with you is by a &quot;test drive&quot; in which we try to design the<br/>perfect &quot;3-speed&quot; model in 24 notes.</p><p>I write this in the hope that you and other readers can reasonably<br/>soon make the &quot;test drive&quot; metaphor more concrete by actually trying<br/>out some of these tunings on a synthesizer, or at least hearing them<br/>on a tape which I may soon by preparing.</p><p>We&apos;ll start out with a rather offbeat (for neo-Gothic purposes) tuning<br/>providing a 3-speed prototype for our bike design, and then seek to<br/>design a Pythagorean-based model (each keyboard in standard<br/>Pythagorean tuning) including similar 3-speed features.</p><p>The result, curiously, is a 3-speed Pythagorean bike with a special<br/>&quot;super-Monzonian&quot; quality: using only powers of 3:2, it almost exactly<br/>emulates an interval which the Monz, in turn, has used to emulate a<br/>ratio of a different prime limit. While I&apos;ve described this new (for<br/>me) tuning on Usenet&apos;s rec.music.theory, this is my first mention of<br/>it on the Tuning List.</p><p>-------------------------------------------------<br/>1. An offbeat 3-speed prototype: 24-out-of-36-tET<br/>-------------------------------------------------</p><p>Given all the recent discussions about 72-tET, why don&apos;t we start with<br/>a prototype of our &quot;Pythagorean bike&quot; design in a very useful subset<br/>of this tuning, 24-out-of-36-tET. Here C4 is middle C, with<br/>Vicentino&apos;s dot shown as an ASCII asterisk (*):</p><p>    133     233          633      833     1033<br/>    C#*3    Eb*3         F#*3     G#*3    Bb*3<br/>C*3     D*3    E*3   F*3      G*3      A*3     B*3   C*4<br/>33      233    433   533      733      933     1133  1233<br/>---------------------------------------------------------<br/>    100     200          600      800     1000<br/>    C#3     Eb3          F#3      G#3      Bb3<br/>C3      D3      E3   F3       G3       A3       B3   C4<br/>0       200    400   500      700      900     1100  1200</p><p>While 36-tET isn&apos;t the most typical neo-Gothic tuning, it features<br/>three of the most popular intonational &quot;flavors&quot; -- a 3-speed bike, to<br/>use our metaphor.</p><p>To get our first or standard Pythagorean speed, we use the regular<br/>intervals available on either keyboard -- identical to those of<br/>12-tET. Here we encounter the main compromise in what would otherwise<br/>be very close to the &quot;perfect&quot; neo-Gothic temperament.</p><p>In the most characteristic neo-Gothic tunings, fifths range from pure<br/>(Pythagorean-based systems) to not quite four cents wide (17-tET).<br/>Major thirds and sixths are Pythagorean or wider, while minor thirds<br/>and sixths are Pythagorean or narrower, as are diatonic semitones.<br/>These parameters nicely fit a style where active thirds and sixths<br/>often serve as points of directed cadential tension, resolving to<br/>stable intervals by progressions involving incisive melodic<br/>semitones.</p><p>In 36-tET, however, the otherwise excellent 700-cent fifths are<br/>tempered by about 2 cents in the narrow or &quot;wrong&quot; direction!  Our<br/>regular thirds and sixths are thus a bit &quot;bland&quot; or &quot;subdued,&quot; and our<br/>100-cent semitones somewhat less incisive and efficient than their<br/>90-cent Pythagorean counterparts. However, these approximations are<br/>still quite reasonable, as a table may suggest:</p><p>--------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>Interval        Pythagorean ratio/cents      36-tET    variation<br/>--------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>   5                  3:2        701.96       700        -1.96<br/>   4                  4:3        498.04       500        +1.96<br/>....................................................................<br/>   M2                 9:8        203.91       200        -3.91<br/>   m7                16:9        996.09      1000        +3.91<br/>....................................................................<br/>   m3                32:27       294.13       300        +5.87<br/>   M6                27:16       905.87       900        -5.87<br/>....................................................................<br/>   M3                81:64       407.82       400        -7.82<br/>   m6               128:81       792.18       800        +7.82<br/>....................................................................<br/>   m2               256:243       90.22       100        +9.78<br/>   M7               243:128     1109.78      1100        -9.78<br/>--------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p>We might accordingly describe 36-tET as a &quot;semi-Pythagorean&quot; bike with<br/>regular thirds, sixths, and diatonic semitones a bit &quot;diluted&quot;; but<br/>the other two speeds, as already noted, are absolutely superb!</p><p>To shift to our second gear -- or speed -- we may try cadences with<br/>major thirds and sixths 1/6-tone wider than the regular ones, and<br/>minor thirds and sevenths 1/6-tone narrower. These cadences combine<br/>usual fifths and fourths with intervals based on factors of 3 and 7<br/>such as 9:7 major thirds, 12:7 major sixths, 7:6 minor thirds, and 7:4<br/>minor sevenths, and are thus referred to as &quot;7-flavor&quot; cadences. Here<br/>are some examples in 36-tET:</p><p>E*4  F4        F4   E*4<br/>D4   C4        D*4  E*4<br/>B*3  C4        Bb3  A*3<br/>G3   F3        G*3  A*3</p><p>The unstable sonority in our first cadence of G3-B*3-D4-E*4, with<br/>rounded intervals of 0-433-700-933 cents, is very close to a pure<br/>ratio 14:18:21:24 (around 0-435-702-933 cents). The outer major sixth,<br/>ideally 12:7 (~933.13 cents), is virtually pure (933.33 cents), and<br/>all other intervals within about 2.16 cents of pure.</p><p>Likewise, in our second cadence, G*3-Bb3-D*4-F4 at 0-267-700-967 cents<br/>outstandingly approximates 12:14:18:21 (0-267-702-969 cents).</p><p>Note that these &quot;7-flavor&quot; cadences in 36-tET involve a melodic<br/>&quot;thirdtone step&quot; such as B*3-C4 or E*4-F4 in the first example, or<br/>Bb3-A*3 or F4-E*4 in the second, with a size of 66-2/3 cents. While<br/>the usual 100-cent semitone may seem a bit wide by neo-Gothic<br/>standards, the contrast between these two sizes of steps can be a very<br/>pleasing one.</p><p>These cadences illustrate a pattern common to many neo-Gothic tunings:<br/>vertical fifths and fourths are played on the same keyboard, while<br/>other intervals such as thirds and sixths often combine notes from<br/>different keyboards.</p><p>Now let us shift to our third speed, featuring cadences with minor<br/>thirds or sixths 1/6-tone _wider_ than usual, and major thirds or<br/>sixths 1/6-tone _narrower_. Since major and minor thirds of this kind<br/>have ratios around 21:17 and 17:14, this is called the &quot;17-flavor,&quot;<br/>again superbly realized in 36-tET:</p><p>B3  C*4<br/>G*3 F*3<br/>E3  F*3</p><p>In this cadence, the sonority E3-G*3-B3 (0-333-700 cents) excellently<br/>approximates the 17-flavor ratio of 14:17:21 (0-336-702 cents).</p><p>Note that each of the outer parts moves by a &quot;2/3-tone&quot; of E3-F*3 or<br/>B3-C*4, or 133-1/3 cents, a characteristic feature of 17-flavor<br/>cadences in various neo-Gothic tunings with similar steps.</p><p>Taken by itself, either the 7-flavor or the 17-flavor of 36-tET would<br/>be very impressive; but _both_ flavors so outstandingly realized make<br/>it a special tuning indeed.</p><p>One of the &quot;offbeat&quot; aspects of 36-tET from a neo-Gothic viewpoint,<br/>its precisely symmetrical regular intervals including our 100-cent<br/>semitones, is not without its advantage here: we can build a given<br/>7-flavor or 17-flavor sonority from all 12 positions on the applicable<br/>keyboard. For example, we can build a 14:18:21:24 sonority like<br/>G3-B*3-D4-E*4, or a 14:17:21 sonority like E3-G*3-B3, above any note<br/>on the lower keyboard; or a 12:14:18:21 sonority like G*3-Bb3-D*4-F4<br/>above any note on the upper keyboard.</p><p>Now for our game of trying to design the &quot;perfect&quot; 3-speed Pythagorean<br/>bike: our object is to come up with a 24-note tuning featuring pure<br/>Pythagorean intonation on each keyboard and at the same time also<br/>offering the best possible 7-flavor and 17-flavor intervals.</p><p>In the process, we&apos;ll encounter another neo-Gothic flavor also<br/>associated with a very famous 20th-century tuning -- before arriving<br/>at a &quot;super-Monzonian&quot; solution I find quite amazing.</p><p>------------------------------------------------------------<br/>2. A perfect bike for two flavors: the septimal comma tuning<br/>------------------------------------------------------------</p><p>Getting two out of our three flavors, or &quot;speeds,&quot; perfect, isn&apos;t<br/>hard, and let&apos;s look at a bike designed for an optimal 7-flavor as<br/>well as the usual Pythagorean intervals.</p><p>Our solution is simply to place our two manuals in regular Pythagorean<br/>tunings of Eb-G# a _septimal_ comma apart: 64:63, or ~27.26 cents,<br/>about 3.80 cents larger than the usual Pythagorean comma with its<br/>ratio of 531441:524288 (~23.46 cents).</p><p>Using Vicentino&apos;s dot, or here our asterisk sign (*), we can give the<br/>notes the same name as in our 36-tET scheme, although the intervals<br/>are different, here shown again in rounded cents:</p><p>    141    321          629       843     1023<br/>    C#*3   Eb*3         F#*3      G#*3    Bb*3<br/>C*3     D*3    E*3   F*3      G*3      A*3     B*3   C*4<br/>27      233    435   525      729      933     1137  1227<br/>---------------------------------------------------------<br/>    114    294          612       816     996<br/>    C#3    Eb3          F#3       G#3     Bb3<br/>C3      D3      E3   F3       G3       A3       B3   C4<br/>0       204    408   498      702      906     1110  1200</p><p>Now our standard Pythagorean intervals forming the backbone of the<br/>tuning, as it were, are perfect on either keyboard: the fifths and<br/>fourths are pure, while the thirds and sixths are active and energetic<br/>and the diatonic semitones incisive.</p><p>Our 7-flavor sonorities such as 14:18:21:24 and 12:14:18:21 are also<br/>perfect. Here a musician accustomed to 12-tET might note a difference<br/>which someone steeped in neo-Gothic tunings would take for granted:<br/>these four-voice sonorities are now available in 8 positions, rather<br/>than the 12 positions of 24-out-of-36-tET.</p><p>For example, we can build G3-B*3-D4-E*3 or G*3-Bb3-D*4-F4 without any<br/>problem because all of the needed spellings are included within our<br/>Eb-G# range (or Eb-G#/Eb*-G#*, to show our full 24-note set). However,<br/>we cannot build something like B3-D#*4-F#4-G#*4 because we do not have<br/>a D#*4 in our set of accidentals; nor F*3-Ab3-C*4-Eb4, which requires<br/>an Ab3. In 36-tET, where Eb*4=D#*4 and G#3=Ab3, there is no problem.</p><p>Historical and &quot;neo-historical&quot; tuning advocates such as myself tend<br/>to describe this as a &quot;stimulating asymmetry&quot; rather than a flaw, and<br/>for typical neo-Gothic styles, 8 positions are quite sufficient. A<br/>composer seeking greater transposibility, however, might find this a<br/>motivation to use 24-out-of-36-tET (or 36-out-of-36-tET!).</p><p>As in 36-tET, our typical 7-flavor cadences involve &quot;thirdtone&quot;<br/>melodic steps such as B*3-C4 or Bb3-A*3, here tuned at a precise ratio<br/>of 28:27, or around 62.96 cents. This is slightly smaller than the<br/>66.67-cent step of 36-tET, either tuning having an excellent effect.</p><p>The Pythagorean-based septimal comma tuning is thus a near-ideal<br/>optimization except for the matter of our 3-speed design: we don&apos;t<br/>have anything close to a 17-flavor in any significant number of<br/>positions.</p><p>While this is in fact a very attractive neo-Gothic tuning, it<br/>therefore isn&apos;t &quot;the tuning to end all tunings&quot; -- and fortunately, we<br/>won&apos;t find any one tuning to replace all the others. Let&apos;s go &quot;back to<br/>the drawing board&quot; on our 3-speed optimization problem.</p><p>-----------------------------------------------------------<br/>3. An ideal model for the 17-flavor -- with something extra<br/>-----------------------------------------------------------</p><p>Suppose that instead of seeking perfect Pythagorean and 7-flavor<br/>ratios, we seek a Pythagorean bike with ideal 17-flavor ratios.</p><p>Just what an &quot;ideal&quot; or &quot;perfect&quot; 17-flavor ratio might be remains an<br/>open question: is it specifically 14:17:21, for example, or equally<br/>anything within about 5 cents in either direction? Let us here take<br/>14:17:21 as _one_ &quot;ideal&quot; as well as mathematically elegant value,<br/>while wisely leaving this larger question open.</p><p>To get a 14:17:21 sonority, we can take an approach similar to that<br/>approximated in 36-tET: place our two Pythagorean manuals at a<br/>distance equal to the difference between a regular minor third and a<br/>17:14 &quot;supraminor&quot; third.</p><p>This difference between a usual Pythagorean minor third at 32:27<br/>(~294.13 cents) and 17:14 (~336.13 cents) turns out to be the complex<br/>integer ratio of 459:448, or about 41.99 cents. We thus get a 24-note<br/>Pythagorean scheme like this:</p><p>    156    336           654       843     1038<br/>    C#*3   Eb*3          F#*3      G#*3    Bb*3<br/>C*3     D*3    E*3   F*3      G*3      A*3     B*3   C*4<br/>42      246    450   540      744      948     1152  1242<br/>---------------------------------------------------------<br/>    114    294           612       816     996<br/>    C#3    Eb3           F#3       G#3     Bb3<br/>C3      D3      E3   F3       G3       A3       B3   C4<br/>0       204    408   498      702      906     1110  1200</p><p>Let&apos;s try out a 17-flavor cadence of the same kind we encountered in<br/>36-tET:</p><p>B3  C*4<br/>G*3 F*3<br/>E3  F*3</p><p>Here the steps E3-F*3 and B3-C*4 have a size equal to about 132 cents,<br/>or more precisely about 132.22 cents, very close to the 133.33-cent<br/>&quot;2/3-tone&quot; step we used in 36-tET.</p><p>From our 3-speed optimization perspective, we find the same kind of<br/>problem as with our septimal comma tuning: we have perfect Pythagorean<br/>tunings on each keyboard, and ideal 17-flavor intervals, but now<br/>cannot get anything very close to a 7-flavor.</p><p>Before moving on to our next bike design, however, let&apos;s pause a<br/>moment to appreciate a different kind of &quot;third speed&quot; on this model,<br/>illustrated in cadences such as the following with the same spellings<br/>as in our examples for 36-tET or the Pythagorean-based septimal comma<br/>system:</p><p>    E*3 F4       F4  E*4<br/>    D4  C4       D*4 E*4<br/>    B*3 C4       Bb3 A*3<br/>    G3  F3       G*3 A*3</p><p>In the first cadence, G3-B*3-D4-E*4 is a rounded 0-450-702-948 cents,<br/>with a 450-cent major third (close to 13:10) and a 948-cent major<br/>sixth (close to 26:15). The latter interval may be close to what<br/>Marchettus of Padua (1318) described as a cadential major sixth<br/>equally distance from the fifth and the octave.</p><p>Similarly, G*3-Bb3-D*4-F4 has a 954-cent minor seventh and a<br/>252-cent minor third, the latter close to 15:13.</p><p>In either variety of cadence, we have very narrow semitones or dieses<br/>of about 48 cents: e.g. B*3-C4 or Bb3-A*3. These steps have a size<br/>equal to the difference between a usual 90-cent Pythagorean semitone<br/>and the 42-cent distance between the keyboards, and are very close to<br/>the 36:35 step (~48.77 cents) of some ancient Greek theorists in the<br/>enharmonic genus.</p><p>In fact, this &quot;3-speed bicycle&quot; shows one way to combine pure<br/>Pythagorean intervals of the kind described by Marchettus of Padua<br/>(2:1, 3:2, 4:3, 9:8) with the kinds of very wide cadential major<br/>thirds and sixths he may well be describing, and very narrow cadential<br/>&quot;dieses.&quot; As I caution in my _Flugblatt_, of course, any keyboard<br/>model can only approximate the fluidity of voices or other<br/>flexible-pitch instruments.</p><p>We can get similarly striking &quot;Marchettan-like(?)&quot; cadences in 24-tET,<br/>with some interesting symmetry properties, as well as in the more<br/>typical neo-Gothic setting of 29-tET.</p><p>To sum up, this is a very notable Pythagorean bike, although with a<br/>different 3-speed set than the one we&apos;re looking for here.</p><p>--------------------------------------------------<br/>4. All three flavors -- a super-Monzonian solution<br/>--------------------------------------------------</p><p>Only within the last couple of weeks or so did a solution to the<br/>Pythagorean 3-speed problem occur to me -- and one with a touch I find<br/>especially elegant, although lovers of _small_ integer ratios may take<br/>another view.</p><p>In our previous two 24-note Pythagorean systems, while each keyboard<br/>featured a chain of pure 3:2 fifths or 4:3 fourths, we used an<br/>interval between the two keyboards involving factors such as 7 (64:63)<br/>or 17 (459:448).</p><p>Here, however, we&apos;ll build a 3-speed bike using _only_ Pythagorean<br/>ratios available in a 53-note chain of fifths or fourths -- that is,<br/>everything will be built from powers of 2:1 and 3:2 or 4:3.</p><p>As it turns out, the solution is tune our two 12-note Pythagorean<br/>keyboards at the distance of three Pythagorean commas, an interval<br/>I&apos;ll call the &quot;tricomma,&quot; equal to 36 pure fifths up less 21 pure<br/>octaves (a single comma is 12 fifths up less 7 pure octaves). This<br/>interval is about 70.38 cents.</p><p>The tricomma is also precisely defined by the rather large integer<br/>ratio of 150094635296999121:144115188075855872.</p><p>Here is our 24-note tricomma tuning in rounded cents:</p><p>    184    365           682       886     1066<br/>    C#*3   Eb*3          F#*3      G#*3    Bb*3<br/>C*3     D*3    E*3   F*3      G*3      A*3     B*3   C*4<br/>70      274    478   568      772      976     1180  1270<br/>---------------------------------------------------------<br/>    114    294           612       816     996<br/>    C#3    Eb3           F#3       G#3     Bb3<br/>C3      D3      E3   F3       G3       A3       B3   C4<br/>0       204    408   498      702      906     1110  1200</p><p>Again, both keyboards are in Eb-G# Pythagorean tunings, so the regular<br/>intervals are all there -- but how about the 7-flavor and 17-flavor?</p><p>Test driving this bike, we notice a change in the &quot;user interface&quot; --<br/>the way we get these other speeds. Let&apos;s see how 7-flavor and<br/>17-flavor intervals are spelled and played, before explicitly letting<br/>the Monzonian cat out of the bag.</p><p>To get 7-flavor intervals, we use spellings like these:</p><p>F4   F*4        E*4 E4<br/>D*4  C*4        D4  E4<br/>C4   C*4        A*3 A3<br/>G*3  F*3        G3  A3</p><p>Here, for example, in the first sonority G*3-C4-D*4-F4, the near-9:7<br/>major third G*3-C4 is actually spelled as a fourth-less-tricomma, and<br/>the near-9:7 major sixth G*3-F4 is a minor-seventh-less-tricomma.</p><p>For the second sonority G3-A*3-D4-E*4, the near-7:4 minor seventh<br/>G3-E*4 is spelled as major-sixth-plus-tricomma, and the near-7:6 minor<br/>third G3-A*3 as major-second-plus-tricomma.</p><p>In these progressions, a small semitone step such as C4-C*4 or F4-F*4<br/>in the first cadence, or A*3-A3 or E*4-E4 in the second, is equal to<br/>the 70-cent tricomma itself.</p><p>We call this kind of cadential semitone &quot;metachromatic&quot;: it involves<br/>moving from a note on one keyboard to the corresponding note on the<br/>other keyboard, with the step equal to the distance between the<br/>manuals, here 70.38 cents.</p><p>Most optimizations tend to involve compromises, and we find here that<br/>our 7-flavor intervals are not especially accurate, varying somewhat<br/>from the pure or near-pure ratios we have seen in some other tunings:</p><p>------------------------------------------------------<br/>Pure ratio/cents      tricomma tuning     variation<br/>------------------------------------------------------<br/> 9:7      435.08         427.66            -7.42<br/>14:9      764.92         772.34            +7.42<br/>......................................................<br/> 7:6      266.87         274.29            +7.42<br/>12:7      933.13         925.71            -7.42<br/>......................................................<br/> 7:4      968.83         976.25            +7.42<br/> 8:7      231.17         223.75            -7.42<br/>------------------------------------------------------</p><p>Our 17-flavor is superb, also involving a different kind of spelling<br/>than in our previous tunings featuring this flavor:</p><p>B*3 C#3<br/>G#3 F#3<br/>E*3 F#3</p><p>Here our near-17:14 supraminor third, E*3-G#3, is actually a usual<br/>Pythagorean major third less a tricomma, an interval of around 337.44<br/>cents, while the near-21:17 submajor third G#3-B*3 is a minor third<br/>plus a tricomma, or about 364.52 cents. These intervals differ by only<br/>about 1.31 cents from our 17-based ratios.</p><p>The large semitone or 2/3-tone steps characteristic of these<br/>resolutions, here E*3-F#3 and B*3-C#4, are realized by the interval of<br/>whole-tone-less-tricomma, or about 133.53 cents, quite close to the<br/>133.33 cents of 36-tET or the 132.22 cents of our Pythagorean-based<br/>pure 14:17:21 tuning.</p><p>Thus our 3-speed tricomma model is a success, at least to my ears in<br/>the right timbre: we get the regular Pythagorean intervals on either<br/>keyboard, plus a rather active 7-flavor and an ideal 17-flavor.</p><p>As &quot;test driving&quot; these different bikes may have suggested, we can use<br/>the same symbols -- the 12 notes from Eb to G# plus Vicentino&apos;s dot --<br/>to specify notes and intervals in any of these 24-note systems. The<br/>musical meaning of these symbols, however, may vary from tuning to<br/>tuning.</p><p>For example, we spell a 7-flavor minor third (at or near 7:6) as<br/>G*3-Bb3 in 36-tET or the Pythagorean septimal comma tuning, but as<br/>G3-A*3 in the tricomma tuning. In the pure 14:17:21 tuning with the<br/>two keyboards 42 cents apart, either spelling would yield an interval<br/>not far from 250 cents, or about midway between a regular major second<br/>and a regular minor third by either Pythagorean or 36-tET standards.</p><p>In this way, the notation is rather like a tablature: it tells which<br/>keys to play, with the resulting intervals depending on the tuning<br/>system in effect for a given piece or section.</p><p>Our bike tour may also have suggested that &quot;optimization&quot; in a<br/>neo-Gothic setting can often be very different than in a typical JI<br/>setting: in addition to simple ratios such as 3:2 or 9:7, we are often<br/>seeking _complex_ ratios, whether built up from Pythagorean chains of<br/>fifths and fourths or derived from some special spacing between the<br/>two manuals.</p><p>------------------------------------------------------------<br/>3.1. The Monzonian cat: Out of the bag and across the bridge<br/>------------------------------------------------------------</p><p>Now for the super-Monzonian (or Monzian?) aspect. Some months ago,<br/>when the Monz discussed using a 75:64 minor third in place of a<br/>simpler 7:6 in order to accommodate the &quot;5-prime&quot; structure of the<br/>overall composition, I was drawn to the idea of using this ratio in a<br/>neo-Gothic tuning. However, I couldn&apos;t come up with any immediately<br/>compelling application, although I told myself that sooner or later I<br/>should tune it on general principle.</p><p>Then, just within the last two weeks or so, looking at the &quot;3-speed&quot;<br/>optimization problem, I came up with the tricomma tuning as a solution<br/>for getting both a 7-flavor and a 17-flavor in a 24-note Pythagorean<br/>tuning -- using only ratios of 2 and 3.</p><p>At about 70.38 cents, the tricomma just happens to be only 0.29 cents<br/>or so smaller than a 25:24 semitone (~70.67 cents), Monz, in your<br/>beloved 5-prime-limit tuning, which Paul Erlich describes as &quot;RI&quot;<br/>(rational intonation).</p><p>As a result, the 7-flavor intervals of the tricomma tuning differ only<br/>by this small amount from a complex 5-limit ratio such as the<br/>Monzonian 75:64 minor third (~274.58 cents), here realized at ~274.29<br/>cents. Likewise our 7-flavor major third is almost identical to 32:25,<br/>our minor seventh to 225:128, and so forth.</p><p>In other words, we have what could be taken as a pure 3-prime-limit RI<br/>emulation of Monz&apos;s 5-prime-limit RI emulation of a 7-based ratio.</p><p>Here my intention wasn&apos;t to emulate the Monz or to use a 75:64, only<br/>to come up with a pure Pythagorean tuning with a good 17-flavor as<br/>well as a 7-flavor. Looking at a 53-note Pythagorean tuning in Manuel<br/>Op de Coul&apos;s Scala program for MS-DOS, I soon realized that a tricomma<br/>tuning could be a neat solution, not-so-accurate 7-flavor and all.</p><p>Then, however, I realized that this tuning included that Monzian 75:64<br/>(or a very close facsimile) I had been meaning to use for months --<br/>maybe making this emulation all the more an act of ultimate flattery<br/>to a connoisseur of &quot;xenharmonic bridges&quot; who richly deserves it.</p><p>Most respectfully,</p><p>Margo Schulter<br/><a href="mailto:mschulter@value.net">mschulter@value.net</a></p></div><h3><a id=22217 href="#22217">ðŸ”—</a>monz &#x3C;joemonz@yahoo.com&#x3E;</h3><span>5/6/2001 6:43:27 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In tuning@y..., mschulter &lt;MSCHULTER@V...&gt; wrote:</p><p><a href="/tuning/topicId_22164.html#22164">/tuning/topicId_22164.html#22164</a></p><p>Hello Margo, and thanks for your delightfully pun-filled<br/>foray into Monzo-land.  :)</p><p>But there is one thing that needs clarification:</p><p>&gt; ------------------------------------------------------------<br/>&gt; 3.1.

Some months<br/>&gt; ago, when the Monz discussed using a 75:64 minor third in<br/>&gt; place of a simpler 7:6 in order to accommodate the &quot;5-prime&quot;<br/>&gt; structure of the overall composition, I was drawn to the idea<br/>&gt; of using this ratio in a neo-Gothic tuning.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; ...<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; In other words, we have what could be taken as a pure<br/>&gt; 3-prime-limit RI emulation of Monz&apos;s 5-prime-limit RI<br/>&gt; emulation of a 7-based ratio.</p><p>While you understood the general point of my discussion of<br/>how I used 75:64 instead of 7:6, I think it&apos;s very important<br/>to clarify that I did *not* use 75:64 to *emulate* 7:6!</p><p>Rather, quite the contrary: I originally tuned that pitch<br/>to 7:6, and upon listening to it, it did not work.  So I<br/>adjusted the pitch upward *by ear* until it was ~279 cents,<br/>which is a few cents higher than 75:64.</p><p>*Then*, in order to fit that pitch into the overall *low-integer*<br/>structure, I chose to tune it as 75:64.  This sounded close<br/>enough to the ~279 pitch I had chosen by ear that I accepted it.</p><p>The point is that I *didn&apos;t* shift that pitch from 7:6 to 75:64<br/>&quot;to accommodate the &apos;5-prime&apos; structure of the overall<br/>composition&quot;.  I shifted it because the simpler ratio 7:6<br/>wasn&apos;t the *sound* I wanted.  If 7:6 had sounded right, as I<br/>had originally anticipated it would, it would have remained.</p><p>There was simply no more-or-less-low-integer ratio that fit<br/>into the ~279-cent slot, so I adjusted it slightly into a<br/>5-limit one that had terms that were still under 100.</p><p>Other than that, your excursion is entirely in keeping with<br/>my ideas.</p><p>Appreciatively,</p><p>monz<br/><a href="http://www.monz.org">http://www.monz.org</a><br/>&quot;All roads lead to n^0&quot;</p></div><h3><a id=22221 href="#22221">ðŸ”—</a>jpehrson@rcn.com</h3><span>5/6/2001 8:21:59 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In tuning@y..., mschulter &lt;MSCHULTER@V...&gt; wrote:</p><p><a href="/tuning/topicId_22164.html#22164">/tuning/topicId_22164.html#22164</a></p><p>&gt;<br/>&gt; Hello, there, Joseph Pehrson, and thank you for some very helpful<br/>&gt; comments and questions.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Within the very modest limits of written prose and ASCII keyboard<br/>&gt; diagrams, maybe one way that I can share some &quot;Pythagorean biking&quot;<br/>&gt; ideas with you is by a &quot;test drive&quot; in which we try to design the<br/>&gt; perfect &quot;3-speed&quot; model in 24 notes.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I write this in the hope that you and other readers can reasonably<br/>&gt; soon make the &quot;test drive&quot; metaphor more concrete by actually trying<br/>&gt; out some of these tunings on a synthesizer, or at least hearing them<br/>&gt; on a tape which I may soon by preparing.<br/>&gt;</p><p>Thank you very much, Margo, for this fascinating post concerning<br/>possible alternate tunings for Gothic music...
