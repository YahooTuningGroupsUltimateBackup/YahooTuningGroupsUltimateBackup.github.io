(obviously, diamond marimba, etc.)<br/>&gt;</p><p>Joseph:</p><p>I hope you don&apos;t mind my jumping in here. This is one area where the notion<br/>of consistency becomes very useful -- when Erv Wilson mapped the<br/>3(1,3,7,9,11,15 Eikosany onto a 22 tone keyboard, it fit wonderfully in that<br/>each appearance of one of the primary just intervals was mapped onto an<br/>identical interval of keyboard space. This is enormously useful in orienting<br/>oneself to the keyboard.</p><p>Of course, by virtue (or vice) of not being equal tempered, the converse --<br/>that each keyboard interval has the same acoustic interval -- is not true,<br/>but I haven&apos;t been greatly bothered by this. In fact, it&apos;s a bit akin to<br/>navigating around a temperament with a wolf, only this one has several<br/>wolves.</p></div>
