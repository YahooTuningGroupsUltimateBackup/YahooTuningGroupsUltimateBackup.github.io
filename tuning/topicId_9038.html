This erroneous technique produces voices that are<br/>&gt; too similar and too smooth, where the evenness of the sound take precedence<br/>&gt; over the interpretation and even the pitch.</p><p>Your use of the words &quot;all the voice coaches&quot; and &quot;everyone&quot; exposes your<br/>na&#xFFFD;vet&#xFFFD;. (Don&apos;t apologize. We were all there once.) Vibrato is different<br/>things to different people. Negative words such as &quot;wobble&quot; and &quot;tremelo&quot;<br/>have been used to describe &quot;erroneous technique&quot; in singing. Is that what<br/>you are referring to as &quot;vibrato.&quot; If so, you are using the word &quot;vibrato&quot;<br/>in a different sense than most teachers of voice.</p><p>Vibrato is a vocal characteristic that emerges quite naturally when singers<br/>_release_ tension in the vocal mechanism. While Asian vocal styles use less<br/>vibrato than most Western vocal styles, it is still there. The most strident<br/>styles are those in which the singer &quot;clutches&quot; the vocal cords in order to<br/>prevent this natural fluctuation from occurring.</p><p>Some jazz singers use vibrato as an expressive element by using it to<br/>&quot;color&quot; the end of a phrase. Some &quot;classical&quot; singers use it continually,<br/>thus eliminating it as an artistic element in their performances.</p><p>I would like to invite you to rethink your statement that vibrato is an<br/>&quot;erroneous technique.&quot;</p><p>Jerry</p></div><h3><a id=9070 href="#9070">ðŸ”—</a>Afmmjr@aol.com</h3><span>3/4/2000 6:07:29 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Vibrato is a treacherous subject: John Cage publicly railed against it,<br/>largely in reaction to opera singers.  It was objectionable to Harry Partch<br/>as constituted by his abhorrence of &quot;the trained voice.&quot;  For me, jazz<br/>stylist Sarah Vaughn is difficult to listen to because her vibrato was so<br/>regular and wide.  I prefer Whitney Houston for her vibrato control.</p><p>Until the 20th century, there was no tradition of vibrato for winds and<br/>strings.  Some instruments, like the clarinet and the horn, still have<br/>traditions which prohibit vibrato.  Voice, like so many other instruments in<br/>12TET, uses vibrato effectively to dull the &quot;compromise&quot; in equal<br/>temperament.  It also aids in disguising poor intonation, especially with<br/>many on a part.</p><p>Jerry, I don&apos;t believe that the vibrato in the voice is all that natural.<br/>For my part, when directing choirs in just intonation in music of Binchois<br/>and Palestrina, vibrato is OUT.  It ruins the power inherent in the tuning,<br/>effectively marring it like graffiti.  For  minimally tempered music, as in<br/>1/4 comma meantone, some vibrato, added to taste, is simply sublime.</p><p>However, vibrato as a normal condition is an unnecessary sideshow, in my<br/>opinion.<br/>There is a natural &quot;jitter&quot; produced by the heartbeat, as reported by Rudolf<br/>Rasch, but it accounts for less than 2 cents.</p><p>Any argument for the natural necessary-ness of vibrato has been disproved by<br/>the ability of those who do not employ it when they will it.  I&apos;ve heard<br/>before from a trained soprano that vibrato was only natural in female voices<br/>and that forcing a female to stop using vibrato was an example of male<br/>domination (in contrast to straight-singing boys).  Though this singer still<br/>struggles with her use of vibrato, her argument seems to have long been<br/>dropped.</p><p>Worse, is when vibrato becomes a bad habit that musicians simply can&apos;t break<br/>off.  Ever hear the old joke of the violinist that was wagging his fingers<br/>even after the conductor asked for non-vibrato?  He argued that the stopped<br/>finger was not moving, only its mates.</p><p>An example of exquisite vibrato is when a classical guitarist lift her or his<br/>instrument and shakes it in the air on a final chord. For solo playing, I&apos;ve<br/>learned at least 7 different vibrati for playing bassoon, sometimes in<br/>combination.  Often, I choose not to use it, or to let it emanate per taste,<br/>regulating its rate as I do dynamics.</p><p>Johnny Reinhard<br/>AFMM</p></div><h3><a id=9075 href="#9075">ðŸ”—</a>Clark &#x3C;CACCOLA@NET1PLUS.COM&#x3E;</h3><span>3/4/2000 4:53:59 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Hi,</p><p>I thought I&apos;d add to Johnny&apos;s informative post perhaps some some<br/>extraneous observations. My own elementary training in a few instruments<br/>treated vibrato in different manners, from none at all - hunting horn -<br/>to obligatory - guitar, in the end all but discarded (with much of the<br/>training) for an idea of vibrato as a sort of extended technique.</p><p>The American parlor organ employs two deliberate effects to a related<br/>end: A &apos;Vox Humana&apos; stop often engages a mechanism which fluctuates the<br/>vacuum of the reservoir resulting more properly in a tremelo despite<br/>it&apos;s more obvious reference to vocal vibrato, alternately it may mean a<br/>secondary rank of reeds mistuned slightly as to beat against the<br/>primary. Of one type of the former method, Horton Presley writes in<br/>_Restoring and Collecting Antique Reed Organs_, &quot;To be perfectly<br/>frank,...It reminds me of some church choir sopranos I have heard who<br/>never seem to find a note to light on.&quot;</p><p>Its contemporary square pianos suffer a vibrato of sorts as a result of<br/>their unfortunate enlargment from earlier, lighter relatives. In nearly<br/>all examples the earlier bridge and soundboard design is retained, while<br/>tensions and hammer size were increased resulting in very prominent<br/>false beats across their compass. More recently, such falseness usually<br/>is isolated and attributed to mistakes, though 1880&apos;s Steinway grands<br/>(and imitations) may have slight bevels in at least one tenor section,<br/>while Baldwin seems to have continued this through the 1960&apos;s in their<br/>concert grands and even more radically in cheap uprights.</p><p>It is interesting to find these variously imitative measures in fixed<br/>pitch instruments, and it would seem to me that similar degrees would<br/>have occurred, perhaps earlier, for those where vibrato is accomplished<br/>more easily.</p><p>Regards,</p><p>Clark</p></div>
