I was inspired to program<br/>it because I came across a book on the Fourth Dimension in Art<br/>(&quot;Foufield: Computers, Art &amp; the 4th Dimension) by Tony Robbin, an<br/>artist who tries to depict 4-D objects in his own work. Back in the<br/>1970, I met him in Houston and had some correspondence with him, but had<br/>lost contact.</p><p>In his book, he showed part of a diagram of a central projection of a<br/>7-D hypercube and I immediately saw that it was based on the<br/>centered-heptagon lattice that I had programmed earlier (based on Erv<br/>Wilson&apos;s ideas). So, I merely had to insert a table of the notes<br/>corresponding to the hypercube or Euler Genus.</p><p>As far as I can tell, hypercubes only in spaces with odd numbers of<br/>dimensions can be projected meaningfully this way. In the  cases of<br/>even-dimensioned spaces, I have had to use some sort of rectilinear lattice.</p><p>Since I already had the programs written, I decided to compute (or write<br/>routines to do so) the notes for all the hypercubes from 2 to 9<br/>dimensions and plot them. Most look very comprehensible and attractive,<br/>except, perhaps, the 9-D hc which is basically a black lace doily with a<br/>nearly solid center due to the low resolution of TrueBASIC and my Mac.<br/>However, the overly of red dots where the notes are looks quite good.</p><p>The hypercubes in even-numbered spaces are less attractive -- the 2, and<br/>4 D cases are fine-- a square and a projected tesseract, but 6 and 8 are<br/>blobby, though if I have time to adjust the angles and lengths of the<br/>underlying lattices, they may improve somewhat.</p><p>--John</p></div>
