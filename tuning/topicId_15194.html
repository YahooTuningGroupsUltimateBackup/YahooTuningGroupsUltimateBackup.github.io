What does it have to do with the<br/>tuning list you ask? Well nothing!, but as most everything else I yap<br/>on about here is more or less appropriate for the forum I figure one<br/>off-topic indiscretion probably won&apos;t raise anyone&apos;s hackles too<br/>much...</p><p>&quot;Frontiersmen are not, as a rule, apt to be very superstitious. They<br/>lead lives too hard and practical, and have too little imagination in<br/>things spiritual and supernatural. I have heard but few ghost-stories<br/>while living on the frontier, and those few were of a perfectly<br/>commonplace and conventional type.</p><p>But I once listened to a goblin-story which rather impressed me. It<br/>was told by a grizzled, weather beaten old mountain hunter, named<br/>Bauman, who was born and had passed all of his life on the Frontier.<br/>He must have believed what he said, for he could hardly repress a<br/>shudder at certain points of the tale; but he was of German ancestry,<br/>and in childhood had doubtless been saturated with all kinds of ghost<br/>and goblin lore, so that many fearsome superstitions were latent in<br/>his mind; besides, he knew well the stories told by the Indian<br/>medicine-men in their winter camps, of the snow-walkers, and the<br/>specters, and the formless evil beings that haunt the forest depths,<br/>and dog and waylay the lonely wanderer who after nightfall passes<br/>through the regions where they lurk; and it may be that when overcome<br/>by the horror of the fate that befell his friend, and when oppressed<br/>by the awful dread of the unknown, he grew to attribute, both at the<br/>time and still more in remembrance, weird and elfin traits to what was<br/>merely some abnormally wicked and cunning wild beast; but whether this<br/>was so or not, no man can say.</p><p>When the event occurred Bauman was still a young man, and was trapping<br/>with a partner among the mountains dividing the forks of the Salmon<br/>from the head of Wisdom River. Not having had much luck, he and his<br/>partner determined to go up into a particularly wild and lonely pass<br/>through which ran a small stream said to contain many beaver. The pass<br/>had an evil reputation because the year before a solitary hunter who<br/>had wandered into it was there slain, seemingly by a wild beast, the<br/>half eaten remains being afterwards found by some mining prospectors<br/>who had passed his camp only the night before.</p><p>The memory of this event, however, weighted very lightly with the two<br/>trappers, who were as adventurous and hardy as others of their kind.<br/>They took their two lean mountain ponies to the foot of the pass where<br/>they left them in an open beaver meadow, the rocky timber-clad ground<br/>being from there onward impracticable for horses. They then struck out<br/>on foot through the vast, gloomy forest, and in about four hours<br/>reached a little open glade where they concluded to camp, as signs of<br/>game were plenty.</p><p>There was still an hour or two of daylight left, and after building a<br/>brush lean-to and throwing down and opening their packs, they started<br/>upstream. The country was very dense and hard to travel through, as<br/>there was much down timber, although here and there the sombre<br/>woodland was broken by small glades of mountain grass. At dusk they<br/>again reached camp. The glade in which it was pitched was not many<br/>yards wide, the tall, close-set pines and firs rising round it like a<br/>wall. On one side was a little stream, beyond which rose the steep<br/>mountain slope, covered with the unbroken growth of evergreen forest.</p><p>They were surprised to find that during their absence something,<br/>apparently a bear, had visited camp, and had rummaged about among<br/>their things, scattering the contents of their packs, and in sheer<br/>wantonness destroying their lean-to. The footprints of the beast were<br/>quite plain, but at first they paid no particular heed to them,<br/>busying themselves with rebuilding the lean-to, laying out their beds<br/>and stores and lighting the fire.</p><p>While Bauman was making ready supper, it being already dark, his<br/>companion began to examine the tracks more closely, and soon took a<br/>brand from the fire to follow them up, where the intruder had walked<br/>along a game trail after leaving the camp. When the brand flickered<br/>out, he returned and took another, repeating his inspection of the<br/>footprints very closely. Coming back to the fire, he stood by it a<br/>minute or two, peering out into the darkness, and suddenly remarked,<br/>&quot;Bauman, that bear has been walking on two legs.&quot; Bauman laughed at<br/>this, but his partner insisted that he was right, and upon again<br/>examining the tracks with a torch, they certainly did seem to be made<br/>by but two paws or feet. However, it was too dark to make sure. After<br/>discussing whether the footprints could possibly be those of a human<br/>being, and coming to the conclusion that they could not be, the two<br/>men rolled up in their blankets, and went to sleep under the lean-to.<br/>At midnight Bauman was awakened by some noise, and sat up in his<br/>blankets. As he did so his nostrils were struck by a strong,<br/>wild-beast odor, and he caught the loom of a great body in the<br/>darkness at the mouth of the lean-to. Grasping his rifle, he fired at<br/>the vague, threatening shadow, but must have missed, for immediately<br/>afterwards he heard the smashing of the underwood as the thing,<br/>whatever it was, rushed off into the impenetrable blackness of the<br/>forest and the night.</p><p>After this the two men slept but little, sitting up by the rekindled<br/>fire, but they heard nothing more. In the morning they started out to<br/>look at the few traps they had set the previous evening and put out<br/>new ones. By an unspoken agreement they kept together all day, and<br/>returned to camp towards evening. On nearing it they saw, hardly to<br/>their astonishment, that the lean-to had again been torn down. The<br/>visitor of the preceding day had returned, and in wanton malice had<br/>tossed about their camp kit and bedding, and destroyed the shanty. The<br/>ground was marked up by its tracks, and on leaving the camp it had<br/>gone along the soft earth by the brook, where the footprints were as<br/>plain as if on snow, and, after a careful scrutiny of the trail, it<br/>certainly did seem as if, whatever the thing was, it had walked off on<br/>but two legs.</p><p>The men, thoroughly uneasy, gathered a great heap of dead logs and<br/>kept up a roaring fire throughout the night, one or the other sitting<br/>on guard most of the time. About midnight the thing came down through<br/>the forest opposite, across the brook, and stayed there on the<br/>hillside for nearly an hour. They could hear the branches crackle as<br/>it moved about, and several times it uttered a harsh, grating,<br/>long-drawn moan, a peculiarly sinister sound. Yet it did not venture<br/>near the fire. In the morning the two trappers, after discussing the<br/>strange events of the last 36 hours, decided that they would shoulder<br/>their packs and leave the valley that afternoon. They were the more<br/>ready to do this because in spite of seeing a good deal of game sign<br/>they had caught very little fur. However it was necessary first to go<br/>along the line of their traps and gather them, and this they started<br/>out to do. All the morning they kept together, picking up trap after<br/>trap, each one empty. On first leaving camp they had the disagreeable<br/>sensation of being followed. In the dense spruce thickets they<br/>occasionally heard a branch snap after they had passed; and now and<br/>then there were slight rustling noises among the small pines to one<br/>side of them.</p><p>At noon they were back within a couple of miles of camp. In the high,<br/>bright sunlight their fears seemed absurd to the two armed men,<br/>accustomed as they were, through long years of lonely wandering in the<br/>wilderness, to face every kind of danger from man, brute or element.<br/>There were still three beaver traps to collect from a little pond in a<br/>wide ravine near by. Bauman volunteered to gather these and bring them<br/>in, while his companion went ahead to camp and made ready the packs.</p><p>On reaching the pond Bauman found three beavers in the traps, one of<br/>which had been pulled loose and carried into a beaver house. He took<br/>several hours in securing and preparing the beaver, and when he<br/>started homewards he marked, with some uneasiness, how low the sun was<br/>getting. As he hurried toward camp, under the tall trees, the silence<br/>and desolation of the forest weighted on him. His feet made no sound<br/>on the pine needles and the slanting sun-rays, striking through among<br/>the straight trunks, made a gray twilight in which objects at a<br/>distance glimmered indistinctly. There was nothing to break the gloomy<br/>stillness which, when there is no breeze, always broods over these<br/>somber primeval forests. At last he came to the edge of the little<br/>glade where the camp lay, and shouted as he approached it, but got no<br/>answer. The camp fire had gone out, though the thin blue smoke was<br/>still curling upwards.</p><p>Near it lay the packs wrapped and arranged. At first Bauman could see<br/>nobody; nor did he receive an answer to his call. Stepping forward he<br/>again shouted, and as he did so his eye fell on the body of his<br/>friend, stretched beside the trunk of a great fallen spruce. Rushing<br/>towards it the horrified trapper found that the body was still warm,<br/>but that the neck was broken, while there were four great fang marks<br/>in the throat.</p><p>The footprints of the unknown beast-creature, printed deep in the soft<br/>soil, told the whole story. The unfortunate man, having finished his<br/>packing, had sat down on the spruce log with his face to the fire, and<br/>his back to the dense woods, to wait for his companion. While thus<br/>waiting, his monstrous assailant, which must have been lurking in the<br/>woods, waiting for a chance to catch one of the adventurers<br/>unprepared, came silently up from behind, walking with long noiseless<br/>steps and seemingly still on two legs. Evidently unheard, it reached<br/>the man, and broke his neck by wrenching his head back with its fore<br/>paws, while it buried its teeth in his throat. It had not eaten the<br/>body, but apparently had romped and gamboled around it in uncouth,<br/>ferocious glee, occasionally rolling over and over it; and had then<br/>fled back into the soundless depths of the woods.</p><p>Bauman, utterly unnerved, and believing that the creature with which<br/>he had to deal was something either half human or half devil, some<br/>great goblin-beast, abandoned everything but his rifle and struck off<br/>at speed down the pass, not halting until he reached the beaver<br/>meadows where the hobbled ponies were still grazing. Mounting, he rode<br/>onwards through the night, until beyond reach of pursuit.&quot;</p><p> -Dan Stearns</p></div>
