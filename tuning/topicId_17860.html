I realize<br/>&gt;&gt;there are serious problems, beyond the mechanics of turning the tuning<br/>&gt;&gt;pin: the string would have to slip over the bridge and the other<br/>&gt;&gt;terminating rail...</p><p>[Ed Foote wrote:]<br/>&gt;I think a more plausible approach would be to mimic the pedal steel<br/>&gt;guitar (the king of all musical instruments!).</p><p>Wow!!  Coming from someone who is intimately familiar with, and clearly<br/>loves, grand pianos, this is a powerful statement!  Where can I learn<br/>more about these?</p><p>[Ed:]<br/>&gt;It would create a piano that weighs several tons, and would have at<br/>&gt;least 30-40 pedals, (driven by a computer-driven set of servos.)<br/>&gt;If I know musicians, there would be a number of them that would want<br/>&gt;the pedals to also be foot-accessible, too, so that they could manually<br/>&gt;adapt pitch on the fly, also.</p><p>Oh yes, count me on that list!  I don&apos;t care what it weighs, as long as<br/>a stage will support it.  To keep the artistic mood intact, it should be<br/>enclosed in a tasteful, if large, case of some sort.  But perhaps, as<br/>long as a computer is in the loop, fewer pedals would do the trick.<br/>Twelve to pick the root key, in some preset tuning, say, and one to<br/>influence the overall sharpness of the instrument.

Assuming it takes 24 notes for one key to work<br/>(9-limit and all) you can do 12 keys with 36 notes.  So that&apos;s only 3<br/>pianos.

I see a small ... black<br/>... shiny box ...  it has MIDI To Host ... and I see a digital audio<br/>out ... it responds to the MIDI Tuning Standard ... including the<br/>realtime messages ... 12 tables it holds ... physical modeling makes<br/>it indistinguishable from a real piano ...  and there ... at the other<br/>end of the MIDI cable ...  a 400GHz Hurd palmtop ... and on the screen<br/>it says ...

Of course, then you&apos;d have the different notes coming from all over,<br/>so that would sound wierd unless you miced them all and mixed it back<br/>together into something that sounded more like one instrument.<br/>At that point you might as well be using a good digital piano instead. My<br/>brother recently got a Yamah P-80, and I&apos;m by no means a digital piano fan,<br/>but boy does it sound amazing, and feels amazing. He&apos;s even able to do wierd<br/>techniques like half-pedalling and stuff like that. Amazing machine and only<br/>about $1000. I don&apos;t know the first thing about its microtonal capabilities,<br/>although if you set it to omni mode, you might be able to run JdLs MIDI<br/>files into it and get a good sound.</p><p>Todd</p></div><h3><a id=17901 href="#17901">ðŸ”—</a>manuel.op.de.coul@eon-benelux.com</h3><span>1/24/2001 12:37:49 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Not so spectacular as the proposals here, but a piano with<br/>real-time tuning is being built at the moment.<br/>Because this year is not only a Partch year but also an<br/>Eivind Groven year, they were born 100 years ago.
