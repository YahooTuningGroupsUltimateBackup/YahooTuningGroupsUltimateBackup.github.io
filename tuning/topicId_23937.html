Playing back a single frequency of a sine wave on tape versus varying the frequency of the oscillator, as it were, live at the same time, either mixed through the same amplifier and loudspeaker or through another channel, would allow an investigation by listening for beats.  Or you could use two oscillators.  Beware because these may have a certain amount of drift, as may a tape machine.  Checking with a frequency counter may help, but this also could drift, or not have a fine enough readout, such as only the nearest 1 Hz.  Still, even without great precision, you could draw a good graph.  Just don&apos;t expect to be able to detect differences of a few cents.  Whether you use sine waves or other waveforms may make a difference.  The choice of what octave to use may also matter.  The oscillator scale is more expanded at lower frequencies, but a frequency counter (most oscillators have markings that aren&apos;t very accurate) good to the nearest Hz, for example, will have more Hz per octave at higher frequencies.  Obviously, the octave between 20 and 40 Hz has only 20Hz, not enough to work with a 43 tone to the octave scale!  If you use other waveforms with harmonics, be aware that some of the harmonics may fall above the upper limit of your range of hearing.  Also, when using electronic equipment, be aware that some intermodulation distortion may be introduced, in addition to any sum and difference tones that you may hear.<br/>If you read Harry&apos;s brief comments in &quot;Genesis of a Music&quot; about the possibilities of electronic instruments, it seems clear that he had no experience with them.  This was largely because they were unaffordable to him, or came on the market too late in his life, rather than any clear aversion to them or philosophical preference for acoustic instruments, apart from being less &quot;corporeal&quot;.<br/>My impression is that Harry was much more concerned with composing and performing real music than with doing psychoacoustic investigations.  After &quot;Genesis&quot; was published, he didn&apos;t even seem very interested or involved with scale theory or discussions about it.  Not only was he a musician seduced into carpentry, he was a writer seduced into arithmetic and mathematics.<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt; <a href="mailto:SETHARES@ECESERV0.ECE.WISC.EDU">SETHARES@ECESERV0.ECE.WISC.EDU</a> 05/29/01 12:13PM &gt;&gt;&gt;</p><p>Michael Saunders asked about the relationship between<br/>Partch&apos;s one footed bride and dissonance curves:</p><p>I havent actually done it, but I&apos;ll bet you could get very close<br/>to the one footed bride using the sensory dissonance methods.<br/>While some people dont like the fact that the method<br/>is dependent on the details of the spectrum of the sound, one<br/>advantage is that by using different spectra you can shape<br/>the curve in many ways.
