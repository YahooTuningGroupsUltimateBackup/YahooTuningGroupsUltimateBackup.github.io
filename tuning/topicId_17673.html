(I remember it was a bit kind of counter-intuitive<br/>somehow).</p><p>Same thing is happening with our Moon and the earth, - the moon<br/>is gaining energy, and its orbit is getting slightly slower, so the month is<br/>getting longer, and at same time the earth&apos;s day is getting longer, so<br/>earth&apos;s rotation is losing energy.</p><p>Slow orbit = higher energy, slow rotation of a planet = lower energy.</p><p>The Earth&apos;s tug on the Moon, instead of speeding it up, slows<br/>it down! (and also slows down the earth&apos;s rotation).</p><p>Sorry to have got it the wrong way round, should have checked it<br/>first.</p><p>Robert</p></div>
