He already had the player piano in mind before he<br/>left the US.  His early pieces published in the New Music Edition were<br/>already rhythmically complex, on the border of playability.</p><p>&lt;&lt;<br/> This is how he came to the player piano... so this &quot;exile&quot; problem is<br/> significant.<br/> &gt;&gt;</p><p>No.  As an exile of sorts from the US as well, and someone who knew Nancarrow<br/>a bit, I think you are confusing matters somewhat.  Exile is an extremely<br/>personal matter, and Nancarrow&apos;s music, while perhaps made possible by the<br/>relative isolation in which he lived, comes out of non-or anti-expressive<br/>aesthetic shared with his idols Bach and Stravinsky.  He would have written<br/>the same kind of music had he stayed in Boston, but probably less of it.</p><p>&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/> It&apos;s lucky that he did, since his player piano music is the most<br/> interesting stuff he has done and really his &quot;claim to fame&quot; or the way he<br/> got recognized through this novelty.<br/>&lt;&lt;&lt;</p><p>There is a great misunderstanding here. Nancarrow never sought out any fame<br/>as a composer; it was just not in his personality, and until the devaluation<br/>of the peso that preceded his winning the MacArthur award, he managed to get<br/>along without music as a source of income.  Even when a circle of his friends<br/>organized a concert in the Belles Artes in Mexico City in the 1950&apos;s, which<br/>was apparently a great success, he would later claim exactly the opposite to<br/>avoid the hassel of hauling his pianos across town again.  The most important<br/>publications of his work were all done largely without his active<br/>participation: Elliot Carter&apos;s arranging score publication in New Music, John<br/>Cage and Merce Cunningham using a recording to accompany a dance, the<br/>Columbia and 1715 Arch recordings and the score publications by Peter<br/>Garland&apos;s _Soundings_: these were all labors of love within a small circle of<br/>friends.</p><p>&gt;&gt;<br/> I believe Kyle Gann is writing a book on Nancarrow...  Gann has transcribed<br/> most of the Nancarrow music for synthesizer.<br/>&gt;&gt;</p><p>Gann&apos;s book has been out for a year or two.   Several others have made<br/>electronic transcriptions, of which K. Barlow&apos;s version of Study #20 presents<br/>some interesting solutions to the limitations of midi.  Yvar Mikhashoff did<br/>several transcriptions for ensembles, under Nancarrow&apos;s authorization<br/>(although the enthusiasm N. had for these is a matter of some controversy).<br/>They are recorded by Ensemble Modern.</p><p>&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;<br/> I am not certain whether Nancarrow did anything outside of 12-tET.  It&apos;s<br/> possible, but I&apos;m not certain...<br/> &gt;&gt;</p><p>Aside from some very tentative work with preparing his pianos and his<br/>collaborations with Trimpin, he stuck to 12tet, and some of the canons are<br/>based upon approximations of tempo ratios corresponding to 12tet ratios.  He<br/>did, however, punch the roll for James Tenney&apos;s wonderful _Spectral Canon_,<br/>which is for a retuned piano.</p></div><h3><a id=6882 href="#6882">ðŸ”—</a>David Beardsley &#x3C;xouoxno@xxxx.xxxx&#x3E;</h3><span>12/11/1999 5:53:59 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p><a href="mailto:DWolf77309@cs.com">DWolf77309@cs.com</a> wrote:</p><p>&gt; &gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;  I believe Kyle Gann is writing a book on Nancarrow...
