All<br/>suggestions are welcome. Science sometimes makes advances when good<br/>shorthand makes apparent previously unseen connections. Maybe it won&apos;t<br/>happen in this case, but it seems to me useful to have a framework and<br/>consistent connected symbology into which like tunings can be grouped.</p><p>John Starrett<br/><a href="http://www-math.cudenver.edu/~jstarret/microtone.html">http://www-math.cudenver.edu/~jstarret/microtone.html</a></p></div>
