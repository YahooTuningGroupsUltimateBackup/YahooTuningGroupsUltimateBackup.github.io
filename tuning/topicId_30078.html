CNMI has been established by<br/>Patrick Ozzard-Low and Lewis Jones, and has recently appointed Donald<br/>Bousted as Leverhulme composer in residence.</p><p>The aim of CNMI is to develop new versions of mainstream acoustic and<br/>orchestral instruments, with the immediate objective of creating<br/>orchestral-type instruments which reliably provide quartertones and<br/>other tuning systems. CNMI is also keen to encourage new timbral<br/>possibilities, acoustic-electronic hybrid instruments, and those which<br/>complement digital and electroacoustic instruments and music.</p><p>The application of new technologies to existing instruments suggests<br/>many new design possibilities. CNMI is prototyping wind instruments in<br/>which keys and valves are activated electromechanically.  For example, a<br/>brass quintet is currently being remodelled by David Cowie to employ<br/>solenoid valve action. Each instrument of the quintet will be<br/>constructed to realise 12, 19, and 24-division equal-temperaments.  A<br/>quartertone flute is also being made in collaboration with the<br/>manufacturer Trevor J. James &amp; Co.</p><p>The purpose of the symposium is to encourage composers, performers and<br/>instrument makers to become involved in the development of new<br/>instruments through the CNMI project.  CNMI plans to announce a &apos;Call<br/>for Scores&apos; for CNMI instruments, for selection and performance in 2002.<br/>CNMI also seeks to create related opportunities for performers,<br/>instrument makers, acousticians and musicologists.</p><p>CNMI projects have recently been generously supported by the Performing<br/>Rights Society Foundation, Boosey &amp; Hawkes, Trevor J. James &amp; Co, and<br/>Paxman Ltd.</p><p>Location: London Guildhall University (Room 100), 41<br/>Commercial Road, London E1 1LA.
