All suggestions are welcome. Science sometimes<br/>&gt; makes advances when good shorthand makes apparent previously<br/>&gt; unseen connections. Maybe it won&apos;t happen in this case, but<br/>&gt; it seems to me useful to have a framework and consistent<br/>&gt; connected symbology into which like tunings can be grouped.</p><p>Go go, go, Johnny, go go go!<br/>... (famous Chuck Berry guitar riff...)</p><p>You&apos;re right on the money here.  I&apos;m sure that one of the<br/>things I found so fascinating the deeper I delved into<br/>tuning theory, was how complicated it seemed to be, and<br/>how mystified and WRONG it has been construed so often<br/>by so many musicians and listeners, when in fact a lot<br/>of the complexity of tuning theory can be reduced to a<br/>couple of very simple principles.</p><p>Abbreviations working in the way John describes reminds<br/>me very much of how mathematics simplifies the operations<br/>and procedures involved in describing how things work, by<br/>representing them by simple symbols, such as letters, various<br/>signs (plus, minus, square root, etc.), Greek letters, and<br/>so on.</p><p>I think lattice diagrams are also a part of that &apos;shorthand&apos;,<br/>in that they reduce a lot of these mathematics, which can<br/>ultimately become quite complex, to an easily-perceived<br/>visual model.</p><p>I register my vote for the EDI/UDI etc., and for the ideas<br/>Carl Lumma presented in contradistinction to these.  They<br/>both have merit.  Can&apos;t wait to see how this turns out...</p><p>(BTW, great subject line for what promises to be a long thread...)</p><p>-monz</p><p>Joseph L.
