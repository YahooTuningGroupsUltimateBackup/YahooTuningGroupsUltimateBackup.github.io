I had always associated the Vikings<br/>&gt; with migrations in a westerly direction, ie, rape and pillage<br/>&gt; in Scotland and the odd foray into North America. This<br/>&gt; gentleman maintained that the Vikings traded extensively down<br/>&gt; the great waterways of Russia and the Ukraine and, via the<br/>&gt; Volga and Dnieper, into Asia Minor. His intention was to canoe<br/>&gt; the rivers and carry the canoe between waterways to simulate<br/>&gt; the Vikings&apos; trade journeys.</p><p>Right, this is absolutely correct.  &quot;Russia&quot; never existed as<br/>a &quot;state&quot; when it was purely Slavic - the first Russian state<br/>was founded by Vikings (with the capital at Novgorod, c. 900),<br/>and so from the beginning was a mixture of the Slavic and<br/>Germanic cultures.</p><p>&gt; ... It struck me when you mentioned<br/>&gt; your interest in Scandinavian and North Germanic music that,<br/>&gt; spaeculatively, all sorts of cultural as well as commercial<br/>&gt; trinkets would have changed hands over a sustained period<br/>&gt; of trading. Who knows what music followed the Vikings back<br/>&gt; to Scandinavia?</p><p>In fact the Vikings are known to have sailed as far south<br/>as Constantinople (which they called &quot;Miklagard&quot;, modern-day<br/>Istanbul, Turkey), as well as the north coast of Africa.</p><p>If they plundered Constantinople (which they most likely did,<br/>but my historical knowledge is wanting here), they certainly<br/>brought back unheard-of treasures, as Constantinople at that<br/>time was pretty much the richest city in the world.</p><p>So perhaps the paradigm shift from 3-limit to 5-limit &quot;3rds&quot;<br/>was really due to the influence of &quot;Oriental&quot; music?  I had<br/>speculated in my long post of 2 years ago that perhaps the<br/>Vikings had even brought it back to Scandinavia from the<br/>native North Americans.</p><p>-monz<br/><a href="http://www.monz.org">http://www.monz.org</a><br/>&quot;All roads lead to n^0&quot;</p></div>
