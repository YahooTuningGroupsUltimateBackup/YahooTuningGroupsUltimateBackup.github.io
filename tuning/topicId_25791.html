Of course, new technologies let us record and share these<br/>performances, or even realize examples or compositions by purely<br/>electronic means.</p><p>The balance between practice and theory can be a delicate one, and my<br/>own approach typically is to tune something at the keyboard, explore<br/>it, and reach conclusions based on that experience.</p><p>The sharing of examples and compositions here is something which gives<br/>the theory a very concrete expression, however small or large the<br/>audience.</p><p>Having said this, I am most pleased to add that public concerts are a<br/>very special kind of arena, and that your contributions to this arena<br/>over the years are a very special gift to our communnity.</p><p>Whether you choose to post, or only at present to read, your sharing<br/>of your experience and musical viewpoint on matters ranging from<br/>1200-tET notation to the intonational ideal of Charles Ives has added<br/>to the variety, color, and excitement both of the microtonal music<br/>scene and of this forum.</p><p>Most appreciatively,</p><p>Margo Schulter<br/><a href="mailto:mschulter@value.net">mschulter@value.net</a></p></div>
