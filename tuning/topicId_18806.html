What follows is in addition to Paul&apos;s remarks in recent<br/>threads on the intentions of those charts, warmly inviting any<br/>corrections or clarifications from Paul.</p><p>The critical point I would immediately make about Paul&apos;s charts is<br/>that they are based on a Partch-like &quot;n-odd-limit&quot; concept which<br/>assumes that each limit includes the intervals of any lower limits.<br/>If any of these lower limits is found to be inconsistent for a given<br/>n-tET, then the charts don&apos;t look at higher-limit ratios for which<br/>what I term &quot;set-consistency&quot; (and Carl Lumma may have termed<br/>something else when he delved into this concept) may indeed obtain.</p><p>To translate this into what may be plainer language: Paul assumes, for<br/>example, that a kind of system on which he focuses, if it seeks ratios<br/>of 7, 9, or 11 odd, will also seek ratios of 5 odd. The tetradic<br/>system he describes, neatly realized in 22-tET, is an example: it<br/>calls for a stable sonority of 4:5:6:7.</p><p>Thus from Paul&apos;s viewpoint (in this article), if an n-tET is<br/>inconsistent for ratios of 5, this is a fundamental flaw from the<br/>viewpoint of building his tetrads -- so rather than proceeding to<br/>survey all of its other resources, he simply shows the highest n-limit<br/>at which it is consistent.</p><p>If I wanted to pick an n-tET for which this procedure does _not_<br/>suggest the total range of resources under other assumptions, an ideal<br/>example might be 17-tET.</p><p>Very simply, for a 7-limit tetradic (4:5:6;7) music, the most relevant<br/>fact is that 17-tET is neither consistent nor accurate for the<br/>5-limit; in fact, 17-tET may be an ideal temperament for avoiding<br/>rather than approximating ratios of 5. From the viewpoint of Paul&apos;s<br/>article, and his charts, that about concludes the inquiry as far as an<br/>ideal 7-limit tetradic tuning goes; the charts do show that 17-tET is<br/>both consistent and rather highly accurate at the 3-limit (fifths at<br/>~705.88 cents, ~3.93 cents wide).</p><p>Now let&apos;s consider a radically different sort of problem: how about<br/>17-tET as a neo-Gothic tuning, where 3-limit ratios form the basis of<br/>stable sonorities, but unstable intervals such as thirds and sixths<br/>can take on all kinds of sizes -- e.g. &quot;thirds&quot; just about anywhere in<br/>the range from around 15:13 (~248 cents) to 13:10 (~454 cents)?</p><p>In contrast to Paul&apos;s 4:5:6:7 tetrad, our stable trine at 2:3:4 has an<br/>excellent representation in 17-tET of around 0-706-1200 cents; less<br/>accurate than some other favorite neo-Gothic tunings, but more<br/>accurate than a typical Renaissance meantone, for example. From Paul&apos;s<br/>charts alone, which show the accurate 3-limit realization for this<br/>tuning, we might find this happy situation an expected one.</p><p>From a neo-Gothic point of view, once we know that a tuning has a<br/>reasonable approximation of 2:3:4 -- or sometimes a &quot;not-so-pure&quot; one,<br/>for example 20-tET at 0-720-1200 cents (fifth ~18.04 cents wide) -- we<br/>can look into the various other resources from a quite different<br/>perspective than would be involved in a music based on 4:5:6 triads or<br/>4:5:6:7 tetrads, for example.</p><p>Rather than following an &quot;n-limit&quot; model which may not so closely<br/>apply, I&apos;ll consider intervals in certain musical groupings which are<br/>intuitive to me (not necessarily to others on this List &lt;grin&gt;).</p><p>First, let&apos;s consider what I&apos;d call the &quot;basic Pythagorean 9-based<br/>intervals,&quot; 9:8 and 16:9, equal respectively to the difference between<br/>a fifth and a fourth, and the sum of two fourths.</p><p>Here the 17-tET counterparts are ~7.85 cents wide of 9:8 (3/17 octave)<br/>and narrow of 16:9 (14/17 octave) -- in each case, a variance equal to<br/>twice the temperament of the fifth or fourth, since these intervals<br/>are formed from chains of two fifths or fourths.</p><p>---------------------------------------------------<br/>Ratio   Cents       17-tET      Cents    Variance<br/>---------------------------------------------------<br/> 9:8   ~203.91    3/17 octave  ~211.76    +~7.85<br/>16:9   ~996.09   14/17 octave  ~988.24    -~7.85<br/>---------------------------------------------------</p><p>Thus we have quite nice although by no means &quot;pure&quot; representations of<br/>such important Gothic/neo-Gothic sonorities as 6:8:9 or 4:6:9,<br/>considerably more accurate than in 22-tET let alone 20-tET -- where,<br/>interestingly, in appropriate timbres these sonorities can remain<br/>recognizable and pleasing.</p><p>How about ratios of 2-3-7? On Paul&apos;s charts, based on a &quot;7-limit&quot;<br/>concept or ratios of 2-3-5-7, the inconsistency of 17-tET for ratios<br/>of 5 makes an inquiry into 2-3-7 somewhat beside the point; but for<br/>neo-Gothic, 2-3-7 (without any need for 5) represents _one_ possible<br/>intonational ideal.</p><p>As it happens, although I haven&apos;t yet confirmed this in a rigorous<br/>manner, 17-tET appears consistent for ratios of 2-3-7, but not<br/>especially accurate (albeit somewhat more so than 12-tET). For<br/>neo-Gothic purposes, the ratios of interest are often, in order of<br/>interval size, 8:7, 7:6, 9:7, 12:7, and 7:4 -- with 14:9 also pleasant<br/>as a minor sixth.</p><p>Accuracy (or rather its inverse, variance) ranges from around 20 cents<br/>for 8:7 and 7:4 to around 16 cents for 7:6 and 12:7, and around 12<br/>cents for 9:7 and 14:9.</p><p>---------------------------------------------------<br/>Ratio   Cents       17-tET      Cents    Variance<br/>---------------------------------------------------<br/> 8:7   ~231.17    3/17 octave  ~211.76   -~19.41<br/> 7:4   ~968.83   14/17 octave  ~988.24   +~19.41<br/> 7:6   ~266.87    4/17 octave  ~282.35   +~15.48<br/>12:7   ~933.13   13/17 octave  ~917.65   -~15.48<br/> 9:7   ~435.08    6/17 octave  ~423.53   -~11.55<br/>14:9   ~764.92   11/17 octave  ~776.47   +~11.55<br/>---------------------------------------------------</p><p>The longer the chain of fifths gets, the greater the accuracy -- in<br/>fact, 17-tET might be described as very close to a 1/7-septimal-comma<br/>temperament. Seven fifths up, curiously, gives us a chromatic semitone<br/>of 2/17 octave or ~141.18 cents -- very close to a &quot;septimal chromatic<br/>semitone&quot; of 243:224, the difference between a 9:8 whole-tone and a<br/>28:27 semitone (~140.95 cents).</p><p>As far as I&apos;ve been able to tell by my crude inductive methods, these<br/>intervals &quot;add up&quot; without any special surprises: we can use the best<br/>approximation for each interval of something like 12:14:18:21 or<br/>14:18:21:24 (the two favorite neo-Gothic quads, or unstable four-voice<br/>sonorities). It may not be especially accurate, but it seems<br/>consistent -- here, unlike on Paul&apos;s charts, factors of 5 aren&apos;t<br/>involved.</p><p>How about ratios of 2-3-7-9-11 -- again without the complication of<br/>Paul&apos;s ratios of 5 (a basic musical ingredient for his purposes in the<br/>article)?</p><p>As it turns out, 17-tET here seems to me both consistent and often<br/>rather accurate.</p><p>Here are some ratios of this 11-based variety, which can have a rather<br/>&quot;mysterious&quot; quality in neo-Gothic, typically resolving by way of<br/>progressions involving the melodic interval of 2/17 octave, the<br/>chromatic semitone:</p><p>---------------------------------------------------<br/>Ratio    Cents       17-tET       Cents    Variance<br/>---------------------------------------------------<br/>11:9    ~347.41    5/17 octave   ~352.94    +~5.53<br/>18:11   ~852.59   12/17 octave   ~847.06    -~5.53<br/>11:8    ~551.32    8/17 octave   ~564.71   +~13.39<br/>16:11   ~648.68    9/17 octave   ~635.29   -~13.39<br/>12:11   ~150.63    2/17 octave   ~141.18    -~9.46<br/>11:6   ~1049.37   15/17 octave  ~1058.82    +~9.46<br/>---------------------------------------------------</p><p>In addition to these &quot;special effects&quot; intervals, we might also<br/>consider 14:11 and 11:7, routinely used (or their close<br/>approximations) as regular major thirds and minor sixths in various<br/>neo-Gothic tunings.</p><p>---------------------------------------------------<br/>Ratio    Cents       17-tET       Cents    Variance<br/>---------------------------------------------------<br/>14:11   ~417.51    6/17 octave   ~423.53    +~6.02<br/>11:7    ~782.49   11/17 octave   ~776.47    -~6.02<br/>---------------------------------------------------</p><p>In conclusion, if we take Paul&apos;s criterion of what I might call<br/>minimal &quot;ballpark&quot; accuracy -- a variance of around 20 cents[1] --<br/>then 17-tET seems to permit consistent expression for a large and<br/>possibly complete set of ratios of 2-3-7-9-11.</p><p>From a neo-Gothic viewpoint, however, if the question is what 17-tET<br/>really does best, I might prefer a more &quot;flavor-oriented&quot; approach:<br/>not necessarily looking at simpler ratios alone, but also at more<br/>complex rational ratios, and at the Noble Mediant of Complexity which<br/>Dave Keenan has introduced to discussions of harmonic entropy.</p><p>In neo-Gothic parlance, 17-tET presents a model &quot;23-flavor&quot; tuning,<br/>because it has a major third very close to 23:18 (~424.36 cents), and<br/>a minor third not too far from 27:23 (~277.59 cents), with<br/>corresponding sizes for major and minor sixths.</p><p>If we apply Dave Keenan&apos;s Noble Mediant, we find that the major third<br/>is also very close to the theoretically estimated point of maximum<br/>complexity or &quot;entropy&quot; between 5:4 and 9:7, ~422.48 cents. Paul<br/>Erlich&apos;s entropy model likewise suggests a maximum around 423 cents.</p><p>More generally, as Dave and I have agreed, 17-tET might be taken as a<br/>kind of overall optimization of complexity for major and minor thirds<br/>and major sixths: these intervals tend toward maximal complexity, and<br/>in many harmonic timbres toward maximal tension.</p><p>From a neo-Gothic perspective, this fine tuning may call for a bit of<br/>discretion with timbres: we want thirds to be active and unstable, but<br/>at the same time to have a _degree_ of blend or &quot;partial concord.&quot; To<br/>borrow a typical 13th-14th century description, these intervals are<br/>&quot;imperfect concords,&quot; and a bit of diplomacy with fifth partials and<br/>the like can bring out this desired effect.</p><p>Of course, from other perspectives, bringing out the extra tension in<br/>those thirds and sixths could facilitate various kinds of effects like<br/>thirds resolving to seconds (a kind of reversal of the Renaissance<br/>suspension), as described by theorists such as Ivor Darreg or John<br/>Chalmers. Neo-Gothic is only one musical approach.</p><p>Curiously, from my neo-Gothic standpoint, 17-tET seems a bit analogous<br/>to 12-tET for someone involved in tertian music of the tonal variety<br/>of which Paul writes. Its symmetry gives it a special status and place<br/>on the spectrum; it appears to be consistent for lots of ratios,<br/>although not necessarily especially accurate in comparison with other<br/>tunings; and it serves as a kind of starting point for unequal 17-note<br/>well-temperaments of the kind which I described here some months ago.</p><p>Anyway, thanks to both you and Paul for an opportunity to touch on<br/>some interesting matters -- and emphasize the point that one article,<br/>by Paul or anyone else, can only look at tunings from a small subset<br/>of the possible viewpoints. Similarly, my description of a tuning from<br/>a neo-Gothic perspective might omit all kinds of things that might be<br/>both obvious and essential for someone involved in a different kind of<br/>music.</p><p>Incidentally, I&apos;d welcome either confirmation or artful contradiction<br/>of my tentative impression that 17-tET is &quot;set-consistent&quot; for ratios<br/>of 2-3-7-9-11.</p><p>----<br/>Note<br/>----</p><p>1. 1.

To fill out the set of tables in my original<br/>post, here&apos;s one for these ratios of 13:</p><p>-----------------------------------------------------<br/>Ratio    Cents       17-tET       Cents    Difference<br/>-----------------------------------------------------<br/>13:7   ~1071.70   15/17 octave   ~1058.82    -~12.88<br/>14:13   ~128.30    2/17 octave    ~141.18    +~12.88<br/>13:8    ~840.53   12/17 octave    ~847.06     +~6.53<br/>16:13   ~359.47    5/17 octave    ~352.94     -~6.53<br/>13:9    ~636.62    9/17 octave    ~635.29     -~1.32<br/>18:13   ~563.38    8/17 octave    ~564.71     +~1.32<br/>13:11   ~289.21    4/17 octave    ~282.35     -~6.86<br/>22:13   ~910.79   13/17 octave    ~917.65     +~6.86<br/>13:12   ~138.57    2/17 octave    ~141.18     +~2.60<br/>24:13  ~1061.43   15/17 octave   ~1058.82     -~2.60<br/>-----------------------------------------------------</p><p>Curiously, in a kind of &quot;numerical pun&quot; which another recent thread on<br/>19-tET and 7-limit JI tunings may suggest, it turns out that these<br/>17-tET approximations of 13-based ratios (2-3-7-9-11-13) are all<br/>accurate to within about 13 cents.</p><p>(As for the roughly 7-cent differences between 19-tET and a 7-limit JI<br/>tuning, it occurs to me that this is, at least in part, a predictable<br/>consequence of the tempering of the fifth or fourth in 19-tET by<br/>around 7.22 cents. Thus 19-tET major thirds will be smaller than 5:4<br/>by this amount, etc. This raises the possibility of a 38-note<br/>&quot;adaptive quasi-JI&quot; system with two 19-tET manuals at ~7.22 cents<br/>apart. I&apos;m not sure if some previous posts may have covered these<br/>points, and my first-blush reading may not have caught everything.)</p><p>People might well observe at this point that all of the above 13-based<br/>ratios with the exception of 13:7 and 13:8, stated in the form a:b,<br/>have a*b &gt; 105, so that it&apos;s debatable whether they would be<br/>&quot;recognizable&quot; as Keenanesque &quot;just&quot; ratios even if purely tuned.<br/>However, the same comment might be made about many of the ratios of 13<br/>and 17 approximated by other tunings such as 22-tET, so I&apos;m presenting<br/>these tables while leaving the &quot;recognizability&quot; issue open.</p><p>By the way, Paul, I much agree that neo-Gothic thirds are really<br/>flexible and don&apos;t need to match or approximate any &quot;recognizable<br/>ratio,&quot; so that we might speak of a &quot;complex 3-limit system.&quot; My use<br/>of &quot;flavors&quot; rather than limits to map the spectrum may in part<br/>reflect this distinction: whether a major third is tuned at or around<br/>81:64, 14:11, 23:18, or 9:7 is a question of &quot;shading&quot; rather than<br/>categorical recognition.</p><p>Just how best to describe this kind of system, and what the<br/>theoretical implications might be, is the kind of issue inviting lots<br/>of dialogue from lots of viewpoints. However, avoiding &quot;n-limit&quot;<br/>terminology in describing unstable neo-Gothic intervals may at least<br/>avoid some opportunities for confusion and misunderstanding, and I&apos;d<br/>like to thank you, Dave Keenan, and others for some exchanges which<br/>have educated me on this not inconsequential point.</p><p>One point on which different musical practices may lead to different<br/>groupings of intervals: like medieval European theorists, I regard the<br/>ratios 9:8 and 16:9 (and also 9:4) as &quot;basic.&quot; The Pythagorean<br/>&quot;quadrichord&quot; with string lengths of 12:9:8:6 includes 9:8 as one of<br/>the four principal nonunisonal intervals of the system (2:1, 3:2, 4:3,<br/>9:8). Thus I tend to group 9:8 -- and its octave complements or<br/>extensions 9:4 and 16:9 -- with the 3-based 3:2 and 4:3.</p><p>In a 3-prime-limit system, 9:8, along with 3:2 and 4:3, is a<br/>superparticular ratio, giving it a certain special status in medieval<br/>theory along with the stable concords, all founded on multiplex (n:1)<br/>or superparticular (n+1:n) ratios.</p><p>There&apos;s lots more to discuss here, Paul, thanks to your creative<br/>comments and those of others, but for now I hope that maybe the list<br/>of 13-based ratios in 17-tET might fill out this point.</p><p>Most appreciatively,</p><p>Margo Schulter<br/><a href="mailto:mschulter@value.net">mschulter@value.net</a></p></div><h3><a id=18982 href="#18982">ðŸ”—</a>PERLICH@ACADIAN-ASSET.COM</h3><span>2/18/2001 8:47:53 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In tuning@y..., &quot;M.
