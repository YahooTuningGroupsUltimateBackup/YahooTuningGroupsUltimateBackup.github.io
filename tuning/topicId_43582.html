I asked if Barbour had any thoughts on<br/>well-temperament being a goal, since it appeared that Barbour actually did<br/>consider them all inferior tunings.<br/>    Owen responded that Barbour was very much a product of his time, and that<br/>he did consider ET to be the ideal.  He quoted Barbour (regarding a<br/>well-temperament) as saying &quot; That would sound out of tune!&quot;  He seemed to<br/>consider  tuning to be divided into two basic forms, restrictive meantone and<br/>equal.  Barbour had never heard a well-temperament until Jorgensen&apos;s<br/>presentation in the mid-60&apos;s!  At that time, Owen said Barbour encouraged him<br/>to continue his investigation.<br/>   So,  I don&apos;t think it too far offbase to believe that when Barbour wrote<br/>his book he considered ET to be the ideal.  It appears that he did, though<br/>was willing to embrace another perspective once he had heard what the<br/>difference is.<br/>Regards,<br/>Ed Foote RPT<br/>Nashville, Tn.</p><p>Ed Foote RPT<br/><a href="http://www.uk-piano.org/edfoote/">www.uk-piano.org/edfoote/</a><br/><a href="http://www.uk-piano.org/edfoote/well_tempered_piano.html">www.uk-piano.org/edfoote/well_tempered_piano.html</a></p></div>
