The relativists would say that numbers<br/>&gt; are a &quot;cultural construct&quot;, basically that we<br/>&gt; invented them. I think the evidence is very strong<br/>&gt; that human beings started using small numbers<br/>&gt; 1,2,3, Many, a long time ago. After the descent into<br/>&gt; agriculture larger numbers were need for counting<br/>&gt; Animals and units of grain to pay to the small number<br/>&gt; of people at the non-shit end of the long stick.

Along with this comes<br/>&gt; an increase in mathematical knowledge.</p><p>what you say here agrees very well with most interpretations<br/>of the archaeological record.</p><p>the Sumerians left the earliest surviving written records<br/>(on baked clay tablets) c. 3500 BC, and they are indeed<br/>simply accounting records, as you descrbe in the first part<br/>of your post.</p><p>by c. 3100 BC they had figured out how to write down<br/>full sentences, and thus began both history and literature.</p><p>&gt; Then some bright spark discovers Pythagoras&apos;s Theorem<br/>&gt; (well before he did), and an even brighter spark asks<br/>&gt; what happens if I want to know the distance across the<br/>&gt; diagonal of a unit square and, Oh Dear, the shit hits<br/>&gt; the fan, the distance is an &quot;irrational&quot; number and<br/>&gt; cannot be written down.
