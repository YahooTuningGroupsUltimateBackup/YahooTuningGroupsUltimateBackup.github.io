They choose the mapping where the period is<br/>an octave, or simple fraction of the octave (half, third,<br/>quarter, etc) and the generator such that it is less than<br/>half the period.  (It&apos;s possible to prove such a mapping<br/>always exists.)  So for father, the period is an octave, the<br/>generator could be a fifth or a fourth, but a fifth would<br/>be &gt; than half an octave so we choose the fourth.

Like, this could be<br/>&gt; rewritten for octave and fifth<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;   2  3  5<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &lt; 1  1  3 | period<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &lt; 0  1 -1 | generator<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Now the generator&apos;s a fifth, so 3/1 is 1 octave + 1 fifth.<br/>&gt; And 5/1 is 3 octaves - 1 fifth.  Keep in mind this is a<br/>&gt; very sharp fifth, just like before it was a very flat fourth.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; So yeah, you can always rewrite a mapping in many ways.<br/>&gt; That&apos;s why Gene and others have devised a standard way of<br/>&gt; choosing one.  They choose the mapping where the period is<br/>&gt; an octave, or simple fraction of the octave (half, third,<br/>&gt; quarter, etc) and the generator such that it is less than<br/>&gt; half the period.  (It&apos;s possible to prove such a mapping<br/>&gt; always exists.)  So for father, the period is an octave, the<br/>&gt; generator could be a fifth or a fourth, but a fifth would<br/>&gt; be &gt; than half an octave so we choose the fourth.  It&apos;s just<br/>&gt; a standard that makes it easier to recognize these mappings.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; -Carl<br/>&gt;</p></div><h3><a id=94475 href="#94475">ðŸ”—</a>Carl Lumma &#x3C;carl@...&#x3E;</h3><span>11/11/2010 5:43:54 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Kraig wrote:</p><p>&gt; I suggest you start over and explain every single number<br/>&gt; in every column because it does not work fro me logically</p><p>These are mappings from the temperament to the primes.<br/>The temperament is generated by two intervals (in the<br/>case of a rank 2 or linear temperament): the period and<br/>the generator.
