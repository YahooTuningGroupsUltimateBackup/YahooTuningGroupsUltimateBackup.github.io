Only one partial will be very strong, while the weak<br/>overtones above that will be exact integer multiples of the frequency in<br/>question. This is because the signal is produced by a spinning wheel, hence<br/>a perfectly periodic vibration, and any perfectly periodic vibration has<br/>exact integer overtones.</p><p>But, if you now engage another drawbar, say the double octave plus major<br/>third, you will now have _two_ overtone series, both with a strong<br/>fundamental and weak overtones, and they will be close to an equal-tempered<br/>major third (rather than a just major third) apart. This can be seen by<br/>examining the gear ratios on the Hammond. We can look at each pair of gears<br/>a major third apart (yes, these are the gears engaged even by the drawbars).<br/>Each individual gear has a two-digit gear ratio with the central 320Hz gear:</p><p>C#4 71/82<br/>D4  67/73<br/>D#4 35/36<br/>E4  69/67<br/>F4  12/11<br/>F#4 37/32<br/>G4  49/40<br/>G#4 48/37<br/>A4  11/8<br/>A#4 67/46<br/>B4  54/35<br/>C5  85/52</p><p>Octave (2/1) gears are used to obtain higher and lower octaves.</p><p>Now let&apos;s calculate the ratios for the major thirds that result:</p><p>notes    ratio      cents<br/>C#-F:   984/781    400.0029<br/>D-F#:   611/485    399.8265<br/>D#-G:    63/50     400.1085<br/>E-G#:  1072/851    399.6886<br/>F-A:    121/96     400.6809<br/>F#-A#: 1072/851    399.6886<br/>G-B:    432/343    399.3873<br/>G#-C:  1604/1273   400.1305<br/>A-C#:   568/451    399.3162<br/>A#-D:    92/73     400.4849<br/>B-D#:  1225/972    400.5042<br/>C-E:    470/373    400.1809</p><p>By contrast, a pure JI major third is 386.3137 cents.</p><p>Anyhow, if you engage all the drawbars, the strongest frequencies will be<br/>tuned virtually in equal temperament with respect to each other. It is true<br/>that, since each drawbar&apos;s tone is not a perfect sine wave, you will also<br/>have some weak frequencies corresponding to exact integer multiples of the<br/>various ET tones.</p><p>Finally, this was the design of the original Hammond organ, and old Hammonds<br/>were made this way. It may be that newer Hammonds use some other mechanism<br/>for the drawbars, perhaps using true harmonic relationships, while the keys<br/>would of course still engage the ET approximations. And that may be one<br/>reason the old Hammonds are more desirable!</p></div><h3><a id=20873 href="#20873">ðŸ”—</a>Alexandros Papadopoulos &#x3C;Alexmoog@otenet.gr&#x3E;</h3><span>4/10/2001 3:15:08 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Can one tune the Hammond by changing the speed of the tonewheels or some<br/>other way?</p></div><h3><a id=20874 href="#20874">ðŸ”—</a>Paul H.
