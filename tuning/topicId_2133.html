You can only<br/>make copies from a home-recorded MD by using the analog (line out)<br/>connections.&quot;</p><p>As information storage changes, the economy must change.  In the &apos;dark<br/>ages&apos; only a few could read, and they controlled the masses in the most<br/>brutal dictatorship ever- a 1000 years of embarrasment.  The printing press<br/>brought about the great revolution of our time, gave rise to &apos;intellectual<br/>property&apos;.  Now &apos;intellectual property&apos; is no good, just like the church of<br/>the middle ages, must go.  I don&apos;t have any easy answers, but I think we<br/>should all be able to agree that the above is not acceptable.</p><p>Carl</p></div>
