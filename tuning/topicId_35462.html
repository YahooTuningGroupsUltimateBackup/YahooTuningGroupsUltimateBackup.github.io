There was an education here that a<br/>piece should not be performed when it malforms and can have no choice but to<br/>malform.  What was in question was a serious of assumptions that I challenged<br/>as false.  The only embarrassment to Carl should be his erroneous assertions.<br/> There were no indications of problems during, or since, the 1999 Microthon.<br/>Carl continues to stand by his assumptions, and that&apos;s just fine.  You are a<br/>different kettle of fish.</p><p>&gt; &gt; Jon, please don&apos;t moralize to me on the List.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; It is a public forum, and your viewpoints are no less subject to commentary<br/>&gt; than anyone else&apos;s. One would hope, being in the position you have placed<br/>&gt; yourself as a concert organizer/promoter, that your ways can be more<br/>&gt; magnanimous in the future, but you have more than two decades worth of<br/>&gt; concerts, and how you run them is certainly your business.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;</p><p>Dear Mom, it&apos;s funny you should try to teach me about magnanimous.  It&apos;s an<br/>inside joke.  I do not consider you fair in your pronouncements for you know<br/>nothing of my concert series.</p><p>Hoping to focus on music again, Johnny Reinhard</p></div>
