So, after some hours of breaking 7-limit commas (I&apos;m feeling almost like in a lab now), I&apos;ve finally found two 2D temperaments with a period of 2/1. The generator for one of them is the 7th root of 14/5, the generator for the other is the 7th root of 12/5. That&apos;s because 3 generators of the former map to 14/9, while 2 generators of the latter map to 9/7. Interestingly enough, the latter also approximates other ratios very recognizably, like 7/2 or 16/11.</p><p>Of course, there are lots of other commas that I could temper out but I was doing it all &quot;manually&quot; and therefore I always tried to find only one step size to save time. For this reason, I often ended up with one approximant being not very recognizable. For example, there&apos;s a comma tempered out if you take 5 equal divisions of 5/1 and use 3 such steps instead of 21/8. But 21/8 is not very recognizable by ear and so I didn&apos;t try that one.</p><p>Okay, these are something like microtonal studies rather than seriously meant compositions.<br/><a href="http://dl.dropbox.com/u/8497979/pp_partial_7limit_1.ogg">http://dl.dropbox.com/u/8497979/pp_partial_7limit_1.ogg</a><br/><a href="http://dl.dropbox.com/u/8497979/pp_partial_7limit_2.ogg">http://dl.dropbox.com/u/8497979/pp_partial_7limit_2.ogg</a></p><p>#2. Recently, someone suggested that some less familiar commas might be worth more obvious illustration. Since I&apos;ve been involved in tempering out small intervals for some time already, I was thinking about a similar idea as well. Interestingly enough, when I try to look them up on the web or temper them out using Graham&apos;s scripts, the &quot;point of a particular comma&quot; seems less obvious to me than when I turn the factors into exponent pairs &quot;manually&quot; using the procedure I mentioned some weeks ago. For example, 2430/2401 is, at least for me quite obviously, 15/8 compared to four steps of 7/6. Or 19683/19600 is, from my personal view again, quite evident 3/1 compared to stacking two 10/9s and two 14/9s. And what I haven&apos;t found mentioned anywhere and what I think is also important in the 7-limit context is the fact that 10976/10935 is an unmistakable 15/4 compared to three steps of 14/9. Therefore, I think there should be some mathematical &quot;mechanism&quot; that would allow to find these kinds of comparison for any particular comma -- at least for those which contain no more than 4 primes, AFAIC. I suspect there are great similarities with my recent idea of 3D temperaments having the lowest possible complexity, but I&apos;m not sure.</p><p>Petr</p><p>PS: Eh, let&apos;s have a 3D one this time:<br/><a href="http://dl.dropbox.com/u/8497979/pp_partial_7limit_3.ogg">http://dl.dropbox.com/u/8497979/pp_partial_7limit_3.ogg</a></p></div><h3><a id=100646 href="#100646">ðŸ”—</a>genewardsmith &#x3C;genewardsmith@...&#x3E;</h3><span>7/8/2011 3:37:57 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, Petr Pa&angst;Â™&Atilde;&shy;zek &lt;petrparizek2000@...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Hi again.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; #1.
