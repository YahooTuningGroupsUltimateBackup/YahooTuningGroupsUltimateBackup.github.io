BTW, I got a very nice new CD from Rod Poole&apos;s<br/>distributor in the mail. Rod plays guitar in JI which two other<br/>musicians bow guitars in the background.</p><p>The neutral diatonic mentioned in the last post and the Clampitt article<br/>has a JI tuning as the 18:22:27 tritriadic. 1/1 9/8 11/9 4/3 3/2 44/27<br/>11/6 2/1. It has a rather Islamic sound and the 9/8 x 88/81 x 12/11<br/>tetrachord was known to Avicenna.</p><p>--John</p></div>
