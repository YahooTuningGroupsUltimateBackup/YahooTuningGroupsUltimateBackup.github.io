Erlich &#x3C;PERLICH@ACADIAN-ASSET.COM&#x3E;</h3><span>3/14/2000 8:36:09 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Looks like it, but it&apos;s actually a plot of the triads x:y:z with x, y, and z<br/>less than or equal to 64, and the upper and lower intervals each between<br/>250&cent; and 550&cent;. <a href="http://www.onelist.com/files/tuning/triads.jpg">http://www.onelist.com/files/tuning/triads.jpg</a>. The three<br/>inversions of the just major triad (clockwise from lower left, 4:5:6, 3:4:5,<br/>and 5:6:8) are shown in red; the three inversions of the just minor triad<br/>(10:12:15, 15:20:24, 12:15:20) are shown in blue; and the three inversions<br/>of Xavier&apos;s minor triad (16:19:24, 12:16:19, 19:24:36) are shown in green.<br/>Not surprisingly, the smaller the numbers in the chord, the larger the<br/>&quot;cell&quot; around it. See if you can identify some of the other large cells.</p><p>Notes for those following the harmonic entropy discussion (see<br/><a href="http://www.ixpres.com/interval/td/entropy.htm">http://www.ixpres.com/interval/td/entropy.htm</a> to catch up):</p><p>These are Voronoi cells, each of which encloses all points closer to its<br/>&quot;nucleus&quot; (the enclosed triad) than to any other nucleus on the plot. They<br/>are not ideal -- you can see that surrounding the simplest chords (=largest<br/>cells), and proceeding alongside each of the &quot;veins&quot; connecting them, there<br/>are a bunch of rather large cells with their nuclei off to one side. The<br/>bulk of these cells should really belong to the simplest chords and to the<br/>thin cells comprising the veins, respectively. Also you can see a couple of<br/>(mostly heptagonal) pointy cells at the confluence of lesser veins -- these<br/>shouldn&apos;t own their pointy end. A 3-term analogue of a Farey series (whose<br/>elements would be the nuclei), delimited by its mediants (which would<br/>somehow define the cell walls), would capture this better, but I haven&apos;t<br/>figured out how to define/calculate such a thing. Matlab has a built-in<br/>Voronoi function, which made plotting this easy.</p><p>I took a look at the effect of using Voronoi cells instead of<br/>mediant-to-mediant ranges for calculating harmonic entropy in the<br/>1-dimensional (dyad) case. For N=20, there were some anomalous minima below<br/>20/19 and above 19/10, due to the lack of fractions between those and 1/1<br/>and 2/1, repsectively, leading to exceptionally large Voronoi cells for<br/>these fractions. For N=40, though, the curve was qualitatively the same<br/>shape as the curve using mediants. That makes sense because for large enough<br/>N, each of the anomalously large cells (which contains a ratio of N or N-1<br/>and is next to a very simple ratio) is close enough to its simple neighbor<br/>(considerably less than a standard deviation away) that its largeness merely<br/>contributes to the dip in harmonic entropy around the simple ratio.</p><p>Therefore I expect that for large enough N, an entropy calculation using the<br/>Voronoi cells will be able to give a reasonable harmonic entropy surface for<br/>triads. Computing this surface will be a very time-consuming task. One minor<br/>complication is that the axes should really be at 120&ordm; angles, not 90&ordm;<br/>angles, so as to treat the three intervals in the chords symmetrically as<br/>regards distance on the plot (this is like the plot on the cover of John<br/>Chalmers&apos;s _Divisions of the Tetrachord_ (see<br/><a href="http://www.ixpres.com/interval/chalmers/diagrams.htm">http://www.ixpres.com/interval/chalmers/diagrams.htm</a>), but here the<br/>intervals add up to zero instead of 500&cent;). That would not affect the<br/>relative areas of the cells but would change the height of a symmetrical 2-d<br/>bell curve over most of them, decreasing those along the axis representing<br/>the outer interval and increasing those perpendicular to it, so as to treat<br/>the three intervals equivalently regardless of the order in which they are<br/>taken.</p></div><h3><a id=9269 href="#9269">ðŸ”—</a>Canright, David &#x3C;dcanright@nps.navy.mil&#x3E;</h3><span>3/16/2000 10:04:00 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Paul,<br/>I had trouble trying to view it yesterday, but today with Carl&apos;s link had no<br/>problem.</p><p>It&apos;s a beautiful and fascinating figure.
