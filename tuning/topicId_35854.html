Some of the experiments I discussed with<br/>John Chalmers provide evidence for this belief. For example, John (in<br/>Tuning<br/>Digest 1008) and I both heard that a chord tuned 0 400 720 was clearly<br/>&quot;better&quot; than a chord tuned 0 372 720, even though the M3 and P5 are<br/>equally<br/>false in both chords. (To refute an explanation based on a preference for<br/>stretched intervals, use the first inversion of these chords.) Therefore<br/>it<br/>matters whether you&apos;re using the best possible m3 in a particular tuning;<br/>just using the best M3 and the best P5 does not guarantee the best major<br/>triad. For example, try 64-tet. There the best perfect fifth is 37 steps,<br/>and the best major third is 21 steps. Changing either of these by 1 to<br/>give<br/>a better minor third of 17 steps improves the major triad. 64-tet is<br/>actually an interesting tuning; it is the simplest equal temperament that<br/>contains all &quot;tonal&quot; systems (defined according to my paper on 22-tET, the<br/>systems are pentatonic, diatonic, and a new system first found in 22-tET<br/>and<br/>described at length in that paper).</p><p>The above assumes that the &quot;best&quot; tuning of a major triad is 4:5:6, a<br/>statement which causes little serious controversy. Unfortunately things<br/>are<br/>not so simple for the minor triad. The 10:12:15 (or 1/6:1/5:1/4) tuning is<br/>lowest in roughness, but for a typical root-position voicing,<br/>(4:8:12:)16:19:24 will sound more stable. Gary Morrison has pointed out<br/>that<br/>there can be two different types of consonance judgments operating at the<br/>same time; I believe that one is based on roughness while the other is<br/>based<br/>on various factors having to do with how well the tones fit into a single<br/>harmonic series. 16:19:24 is typically still within the &quot;dip&quot; in the<br/>roughness function whose local minimum is at 10:12:15, so 16:19:24 is<br/>still<br/>less rough than just about any triad besides the major. To me a<br/>root-position minor triad sounds out-of-tune as 10:12:15, although I think<br/>12:15:20 (1/5:1/4:1/3) is a very sweet first-inversion minor triad.</p><p>So it is possible that the best thirds for the major triad are different<br/>that the best thirds for the minor triad. It destroys a lot of the<br/>mathematical beauty of 5-limit theory by bringing in the 19th harmonic,<br/>but<br/>I have to let my ears be the final arbiter, and in this case they tell be<br/>that the 19th harmonic is important.</p><p>A much-ignored study by Pierce and Roberts (I think; it&apos;s from the book<br/>_Harmony and Tonality_) found that untrained listeners generally fall into<br/>two categories, &quot;pure&quot; and &quot;rich&quot;. The pure listeners liked just 4:5:6 and<br/>3:5:7 triads better than versions of those chords where the middle tone<br/>was<br/>displaced by +/-15 or +/-30 cents, while the rich listeners like the<br/>15-cents-off versions of the chords best, with no particular preference<br/>between a +15 and a -15 cent &quot;error&quot; However, for 10:12:15 (or<br/>1/6:1/5:1/4)<br/>chords, both classes of listeners preferred the version where the middle<br/>tone was lowered by 15 cents. The authors of the article did not provide<br/>much of an explanation of this phenomenon. Note that although the 15-cent<br/>shift has about the same effect on roughness for both major and minor<br/>triads, the listeners may have been motivated not so much by the small<br/>differences in roughness but by a preference for harmonic series. The<br/>preferred version of the minor triad is very close to 16:19:24, which has<br/>a<br/>note octave-equivalent to the fundamental in the bottom voice. Thus in a<br/>sense it better resembles a harmonic series than the &quot;just&quot; or 10:12:15<br/>minor triad. The rich listeners may have also been attracted to the<br/>beating,<br/>which is on the order of 7 times per second for the +/- 15 cent versions<br/>of<br/>all of these chords.</p></div><h3><a id=35970 href="#35970">ðŸ”—</a>paulerlich &#x3C;paul@stretch-music.com&#x3E;</h3><span>3/25/2002 12:27:27 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In tuning@y..., manuel.op.de.coul@e... wrote:<br/>&gt; Paul asked me to repost this:</p><p>thanks manuel. i want to call attention in particular to the last<br/>paragraph.</p><p>&gt;<br/>&gt; Date: Mon, 5 May 1997 07:16:11 -0700<br/>&gt; From: PAULE<br/>&gt; To: Multiple recipients of list &lt;tuning@e...&gt;<br/>&gt; Subject: Tuning thirds in triads<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; The reason I differ with Paul Rapoport when he defines the m3 as<br/>simply<br/>&gt; &quot;left over&quot; from the P5 and the M3 is that in tuning a major triad,<br/>both<br/>&gt; thirds are important to my ears.
