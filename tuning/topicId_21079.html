They have<br/>an ecological mission, believing that the tuning system of 12 equally<br/>spaced pitches to the octave, common in Western music for the past<br/>three centuries, is artificial. They want to get back to pure systems<br/>found in nature that are based upon the harmonic overtone series.<br/>They agree in their joint effort to fight the system, but they are<br/>also mavericks, obsessive in their defenses of their individual arcane<br/>methods of tuning.</p><p>Like so many environmentalists, microtonalists prize<br/>self-sufficiency. They build their own instruments and make their<br/>own CDs. Their patron saint, Harry Partch, whose 100th birthday is<br/>being celebrated this year, created beautiful and unusual homemade<br/>instruments. But he is also celebrated for his profoundly<br/>anti-establishment streak, which included his becoming a hobo during<br/>the Depression.</p><p> But incorrigible maverick though he was, Partch also found favor,<br/>at least for brief stretches, at several academic institutions, as<br/>many microtonalists do today. Thus MicroFest 2001, which was billed as<br/>the first conference of microtonality, was hosted by the Claremont<br/>Colleges Friday through Sunday, and its participants seemed equally<br/>divided between those with academic affiliations and those proudly<br/>without. All the participants in the three days&apos; worth of concerts and<br/>formal papers were, however, far from the musical mainstream. One<br/>of the weekend&apos;s fashion statements was sandals with socks, rain<br/>or shine.</p><p>Passion ran high. A physical fight reportedly broke out at one point<br/>between two feuding participants. During his presentation, a<br/>musicologist from Mexico City described the atmosphere surrounding<br/>one Mexican microtonalist as being like a cult. &quot;You have to go to a<br/>dark house to hear his instruments,&quot; Alejandro L. Madrid said.<br/>As its own religious gathering of sorts, this MicroFest was<br/>oblivious to both the first night of Passover, Saturday (when an<br/> important concert and a keynote address by Lou Harrison was<br/>scheduled) and Palm Sunday (papers began at 9 a.m.)</p><p>For most of us, microtonal music sounds out of tune. But it is hard<br/> to define in what way because just about every microtonal composer<br/> seems to have a different tuning system. Partch invented one with 43<br/>tones to the octave. Modern microtonalists become attached to their<br/>own systems, be they 19 tones to the octave or 23 or some other<br/>number, and they are ready to tell you that one system or another<br/>has the purest intervals. Among the papers were &quot;Common Tone<br/> Adaptive Tuning Using Genetic Algorithms,&quot; &quot;Transposed Hexanies&quot;<br/>and &quot;The Euler Genera and an Hyperdimensional Tone-lattice.&quot;</p><p>My own selective attendance concentrated on more general and<br/>historical approaches, and there were some fascinating points. In the<br/>Renaissance, Guillaume Costeley wrote with microtones, and it<br/>would be good to hear it sung, not presented via computer as it was<br/>during a paper on Friday. Joe Monzo, of Sonic Arts in San Diego,<br/>described Schoenberg and Webern&apos;s fascination with microtones in<br/>the early 20th century. Had the Nazis not stepped in, something might<br/>have come of that.</p><p>But fascination and obsession are two different things. Most at<br/>the MicroFest are obsessed. One heard that obsession in boring<br/>music that lingered on favored intervals but went nowhere.<br/>Occasionally something strong emerged, such as when local<br/> composer Kraig Grady hit combinations of pitches on his jiggered<br/>vibraphone that seemed to turn a listener&apos;s head into a bell. And I<br/>was sorry to miss, on Saturday night, East Coast critic and composer<br/>Kyle Gann&apos;s &quot;Custer and Sitting Bull,&quot; which I know from other<br/>performances and a CD to be an engrossing work for synthesizer<br/>and reciter, in which microtones are used for telling dramatic effect.</p><p>But it was mainly concerts devoted to Partch and Harrison, Friday<br/>and Sunday nights, that demonstrated the lasting power of<br/>microtones. Their music reveals a large and human view of the world<br/>that encompasses many eras of history and many cultures.<br/>Partch once dismissed his 43-pitch scale as one-quarter of<br/>one-tenth the truth. Friday&apos;s concert of early Partch (works from<br/>1929 to 1950) was all about truth--the truth of experience. His<br/>musical subjects were the newsboys on the street corner, the hobos<br/>he met riding the rails, ancient Chinese poetry and ancient Greek<br/>scales.</p><p>His instruments are striking. The performers, Just Strings, a local<br/>five-member ensemble headed by John Schneider, had one<br/>instrument, a kithara built by Partch, a copy of one of his diamond<br/>marimbas, and adapted cellos and guitars. Performances, lyrical and<br/>theatrical, emphasized the musical side of a composer too often<br/>known for his quirkiness.</p><p>The Harrison concert included the premiere of a work from 1935,<br/>a movement from a work for nine strings in quarter tones<br/>&quot;Geography of Heaven,&quot; which Harrison wrote at age 17. It is a<br/>young man&apos;s moody, mystical chromatic music, the movement aptly<br/>titled &quot;Soul Soaring Aflame.&quot;</p><p>Harrison uses many systems of tunings, some from early Western<br/>music, some from his interests in the music of the East. In his long<br/>life--he turns 84 next month--he has gleefully absorbed music from<br/>everywhere. Only a drop in the bucket of a highly prolific composer,<br/>the program ranged from stunning chromatic organ music to small<br/>serenades for guitar, pieces for harp or a score for tack piano (like<br/>those found in honky-tonk). It ended with a rush of glorious melody in<br/>&quot;Threnody for Carlos Chavez&quot; for solo viola and gamelan.</p><p>The level of performance was impressive. Among the Pomona<br/>college soloists were pianist Genevieve Feiwen Lee, violinist Rachel<br/>Vetter Huang, organist Carey Roberson, violist Cynthia Fogg, and<br/>percussionist Bill Alves, who organized the three-day event. In their<br/>hands, Harrison&apos;s microtones sounded no more doctrinaire than the<br/>music of Schubert, which makes Harrison the most natural<br/>microtonalist of them all.</p><p>Copyright 2001 Los Angeles Times</p></div>
