Anybody know if Mathieu was the first to use the term &quot;pun&quot;?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; 2. Anybody know the first theorist to state that puns were a<br/>&gt; natural/desirable thing (as opposed to merely stating that comma<br/>&gt; shifts are bad)?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; -Carl<br/>&gt;</p><p>If we really want to find an earlier usage, then Tanaka&apos;s use of the term<br/>&quot;Verwechselung&quot; carries precisely this sense and is not, in this context,<br/>incorrectly translated as &quot;pun&quot;.</p><p>It&apos;s a term that has definitely been in the air for a long time.  I<br/>certainly used it in a postive sense when teaching theory at Wesleyan  in<br/>&apos;84 and &apos;85.  (I still have some of my worksheets illustrating meantone on<br/>a toroid lattice with word &quot;pun&quot; over an arrow connecting tones ostensibly<br/>a comma apart),  David Feldman and I used in some research in those years,<br/>and I definitely used it at my JIN  talk in San Francisco in &apos;88 or &apos;89 in<br/>discussing progressions like that Partch uses in The Letter and the<br/>choruses in Oedipus.   I either got the term from Leedy or Wilson or<br/>perhaps from Makeig&apos;s dissertation, and that would have been in the late<br/>1970&apos;s.  In any case, given my enthusiam for the puns in Finnegans Wake<br/>and in Duchamp, I was automatically attached to the term.   I did write a<br/>post in the Tuning list in the late 90&apos;s on types of intonational puns,<br/>using types of literary puns (homophonic, heteronymic, portmanteau etc.)<br/>to categorize them, but I don&apos;t have a copy of it myself anymore.
