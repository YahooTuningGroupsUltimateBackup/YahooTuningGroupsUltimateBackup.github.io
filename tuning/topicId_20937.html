It is an exposition which<br/>unequivocally demonstrates the shruti-s on a pair of vina-s.<br/>See &apos;sangita-ratnakara&apos;, Chapter I, section 3, verses 10-22.  The<br/>keywords there are:<br/>two identical vina-s, one of them invariable, the other variable;<br/>four movements; tuning the next string a little bit [the Sanskrit<br/>word used is &quot;manaak&quot;, (an indeclinable)] higher, in ascending<br/>pitches; disallowing any intervening audible sound while maintaining<br/>continuity between any two shruti-s -- this is JND, to be sure,<br/>though, a different kind.  We do not need to go into the details of<br/>the four movements here.</p><p>Comparison between JND and shruti &quot;JND&quot;:</p><p>    JND                                      Shruti &quot;JND&quot;</p><p>1.

The second tone: Higher or lower         Higher<br/>etc. etc. ....<br/>Note: As a mere guess, the lowest vina sound could be, say, 50 Hz.</p><p>The queries: (1) Sharngadeva wants only experts to perform this<br/>experiment -- who better than the members of this tuning group?<br/>(2) I am sure we can use an electronic device (computer?) to<br/>substitute the two vina-s.

Suggestions, please?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Has this ever been tried on a computer, using proper hardware and<br/>&gt; software?<br/>&gt;</p><p> Dear Haresh,</p><p>no, I haven&apos;t tried this, but I think for the experiment to work out<br/>properly you would indeed need experts who know what the srutis are<br/>beforehand. If all the srutis are really equal, the experiment<br/>demonstrates equal temperament (or steps of &quot;roughly&quot; 129/125) with<br/>109 cent for any two sruti, 163 for three, and 218 for four.<br/>(Actually, my source - English translation by Dr. R. K. Shringy<br/>under the supervision of Dr. Prem Lata Sharma, 1991 - presupposes<br/>vinas of 22 strings, where a single one would be sufficient for such<br/>a demonstration; also, they think it will only work in shadja<br/>grama.)</p><p>I try to ignore this experiment. Reason:<br/>My understanding of the sruti is that they were originally a fine<br/>division of the vina fingerboard (?) to define and/or assist in<br/>placing the frets for specific types of music (the gramas). From the<br/>nut, it would start out with a ninefold harmonic division of the<br/>fourth. In this case the first movement would be by 28/27 or 63<br/>cents, the second by 29/27 or 124 cents, the third by 10/9 or 182<br/>cents, the fourth by 31/27 or 239 cents: only the three sruti<br/>movement would yield the desired result. For even more ludicrous<br/>results, you can take your sruti size from the retuned vina and<br/>repeat the 63 cent steps.<br/>Or you could take your steps from the fourfold division of the 9/8<br/>between the fourth and the fifth. The moves would be 33/32 (53<br/>cents), 17/16 (105 cents), 35/32 (155 cents), and 9/8 (204 cents).<br/>If you don&apos;t care about the difference between 16/15 and 17/16 (just<br/>about 5 cents and therefore not necessarily &quot;sruti&quot;, i.e. audible?),<br/>you get sensible results for the two and four sruti movements.</p><p>On the other hand, you could take the expected results and determine<br/>the sruti:<br/>The lower part of shadja grama is 1, 9/8, 5/4, 4/3, and 3/2.<br/>Your first transpositions could be anything, but the second would<br/>have to add up with it to 16/15 (112 cents).<br/>Now Ni will have the same pitch as the original Ma: 16/15, 6/5, 4/3,<br/>64/45, 8/5.<br/>The next move is by 25/24 (71 cents); the pitch of Ga reappears as<br/>Ri: 5/4, 25/18, 40/27, 5/3.<br/>And finally, there is just a komma (81/80; 22 cents) missing to make<br/>Ma equal to the original Pa: 81/64, 45/32, 3/2, 27/16.<br/>Paul Lanski stayed within 5-limit and took the first two<br/>transpositions to be 256/243 and 81/80 (adding up to 16/15).</p><p>Of course, this last experiment could easily be done with two only<br/>slightly sophisticated synthesizers.</p><p>klaus</p></div>
