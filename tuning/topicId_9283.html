My ears don&apos;t analyse that chord as a major and minor<br/>chords sounding together.<br/>For minor triads, I postulate it&apos;s 16-19-24 (my ears agree with my<br/>brain...), but only for Ist degree and may be for minor dominant, for<br/>other degrees, I think that, as for secondary seventh, it depends on the<br/>context. On the IId degree, I suppose it will be 16-19-24 or 6-7-9 or<br/>may be an other thing. On the IIIrd degree, may be it&apos;s 10-12-15?</p><p>Xavier Charles</p></div>
