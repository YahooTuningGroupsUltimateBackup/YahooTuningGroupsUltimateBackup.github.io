I concur with you that any idea, no matter how shocking or intolerable should be open to debate, be it dogmatic, scientific, or else.</p><p>As I have mentioned once too often, Turkey&apos;s record in that respect is not very inspiring. Communist/Socialist/Nationalist regimes have such a bad reputation for promoting censorship and authoritarianism. These, we have to oppose democratically with free thought, righteous determination and strong arguments alone.</p><p>I am not proud to say that I was once an advocate of oppression and censorship, that is, before I was enlightened by the Quran. I say it now to emphasize my realization of how horrible tyranny can be.</p><p>Cordially,<br/>Ozan</p></div>
