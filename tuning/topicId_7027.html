Before I joined the TD last January I just<br/>sort of groped through my own ways doing and (ahem...) &quot;explaining&quot;<br/>things, and while there&apos;s little doubt that for the most part I still<br/>do; I&apos;d also hope that a year of being exposed to people laying things<br/>out in a coherent and intelligible manner has rubbed off at least a<br/>little bit! (And if this isn&apos;t the case - which it probably isn&apos;t,<br/>well I still feel as though I&apos;ve really benefited from the exposure<br/>anyway...)</p><p>[Joe:]<br/>&gt; Your original explanation to me of how the periodic table<br/>&gt; works said that it might be clearer if I relate it to the<br/>&gt; table which appears later in your post, showing the<br/>&gt; 1/35-&apos;octave&apos; space.  But it wasn&apos;t.  That only mystified<br/>&gt; me further, as I saw no connection whatever between the<br/>&gt; periodic table and the 1/35 diagram.</p><p>Ah ha! Think of the two fifths, 3/5 (at 720&#xFFFD;) and 4/7 at (~686&#xFFFD;). Now<br/>I&apos;m sure that this diagram will make sense with that in mind... as<br/>each fraction represents the fifth size over the EDO, or put another<br/>way the linear interval capable of creating the scale (which in this<br/>case is seven note scale with five large and two small step sizes) --<br/>or that falls into this 1/35 space between 3/5 (at 720&#xFFFD;) and 4/7 at<br/>(~686&#xFFFD;) -- and the EDO that contains it.</p><p>                     (4/7)  (3/5)<br/>                         \  /<br/>                         7/12<br/>                        /   \<br/>                    10/17   11/19<br/>                    /   \   /   \<br/>                13/22   14/24   15/26<br/>                /   \   /   \   /   \<br/>            16/27   17/29   18/31   19/33<br/>            /   \   /   \   /   \   /   \<br/>        19/32   20/34   21/36   22/38   17/40<br/>        ...</p><p>Another way to look at this (without the linear interval clearly<br/>illuminated) is:</p><p>(5)  (7)<br/>(10) 12 (14)<br/>(15) 17  19 (21)<br/>(20) 22  24  26 (28)<br/>(25) 27  29  31  33 (35)<br/>(30) 32  34  36  38  40  42<br/>(35) 37  39  41  43  45  47  49<br/> 40  42  44  46  48  50  52  54  56<br/> 45  47  49  51  53  55  57  59  61  63<br/> 50  52  54  56  58  60  62  64  66  68  70<br/> ...</p><p>This also shows how the &quot;periodic table&quot; expands towards &quot;L&quot; without<br/>the truncation... The vertical and horizontal expansions could in a<br/>sense be seen as the cases of  maximum ambiguity in a given mapping,<br/>as s=0 and s=L&amp;L=s are what the horizontal (or diagonal) and vertical<br/>expansions are working towards, i.e., L (equal) and L+s (equal). And<br/>while the truncation -- where the table is seen as a horizontal<br/>sequence of -s (mod L+s) truncated by letting 0=L+s -- addresses the<br/>horizontal (or diagonal) expansion, I&apos;m somewhat inclined to think<br/>that the vertical expansion is probably best addressed by commonsense<br/>and ones personal inclination to work (or not work as the case may be)<br/>with larger and larger EDO&apos;s... If I were to show the previous example<br/>with the truncation it would look like this:</p><p>(5)  (7)<br/>(10) 12 (14)<br/>(15) 17  19 (21)<br/>(20) 22  24  26 (28)<br/>(25) 27  29  31  33 (35)<br/>(30) 32  34  36  38  40<br/>(35) 37  39  41  43  45  47<br/>     42  44  46  48  50  52  54<br/>         49  51  53  55  57  59  61<br/>             56  58  60  62  64  66  68<br/>                 63  65  67  69  71  73  75<br/>                     ...</p><p>Compare that with this:</p><p>(5)  3   1   6   4   2   7<br/>12 (10)  8  13  11   9  14<br/>19  17 (15)(20) 18  16  21<br/>26  24  22  27 (25) 23  28<br/>33  31  29  34  32 (30)(35)<br/>40  38  36  41  39  37  42<br/>47  45  43  48  46  44  49<br/>54  52  50  55  53  51  56<br/>61  59  57  62  60  58  63<br/>...</p><p>Now just as the mediants, or &quot;scale tree&quot; like example I gave of this<br/>before:</p><p>(3/5)                                                (4/7)<br/>                          7/12<br/>          10/17                          11/19<br/>    13/22         17/29          18/31          15/26<br/> 16/27 23/39  27/46   24/41  25/43   29/50   26/45 19/33<br/> ...</p><p>affords a very efficient view of what&apos;s going on (i.e., only the two<br/>borders between which the linear interval must fall and then the EDOs<br/>which don&apos;t represent duplicate mappings, in other words 12 &amp; 24e at<br/>2212221 and 4424442, etc.), the &quot;periodic table&quot; allows one to see<br/>everything of a given mapping at a glance... i.e., the EDOs that won&apos;t<br/>work (which could be seen as both a handy convenience as well as a<br/>possible stable framework from which to index two step size<br/>cardinality in a given mapping), the borders (which are the expansions<br/>&quot;L&quot; and &quot;L&quot;+&quot;s&quot;), and the EDOs that do &quot;work.&quot;</p><p>And while we&apos;ve been pretty consistently sticking to the seven note<br/>scale with five (identical) large and two (identical) small step<br/>sizes, (i.e., a 5L&amp;2s mapping) as an example, L&amp;s are just variables<br/>here, and the 5L&amp;2s just one example...</p><p>Dan</p></div>
