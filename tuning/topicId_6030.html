No matter how<br/>much we would like to make the Babylonians into proto-pythagoreans -- an<br/>attractive idea to be sure -- the evidence is just not there.</p><p>&lt;&lt;<br/> I think it is premature to infer musical universals from such dubious<br/> and fragmentary evidence, but I&apos;m becoming curmudgeonly these days.<br/>&gt;&gt;</p><p>John, I&apos;d suggest we start a club for xenharmonic curmudgeons, but then<br/>again, would we really want to join any club that would have us for members?</p><p>DJW</p></div><h3><a id=6031 href="#6031">ðŸ”—</a>DWolf77309@xx.xxx</h3><span>11/9/1999 9:00:52 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>But seriously, folks:</p><p>The report on the chinese flute is a good example of old-fashioned<br/>soviet-cum-nationalist music ethnology.  The researchers sought to prove a<br/>link between the artifact and the great chinese cultural tradition and did it<br/>by playing a &quot;ancient chinese melody&quot; on the flute.  By blowing harder or<br/>softer, or adjusting the embouchure, one probably could play a folksong from<br/>almost anywhere on said flute.  A reasonable piece of scholarship would have<br/>instead begun by attempting to record tones played in all of the possible<br/>fingering, at each partial, and with a variety of embouchure approaches. Only<br/>then could we begin to get a real idea of the character of the instrument.</p><p>DJW</p></div>
