I suggest our current exchange demands<br/>we review our use the consecutive odd factor assumption (I would<br/>never assume it for CPS).</p><p>&gt;I&apos;d still rather say you&apos;re completing the chords with respect to<br/>&gt;the initial factor set, rather than saturating the chords with<br/>&gt;respect to the initial factor set.</p><p>Sounds good.  We&apos;ll have to replace &apos;Partchian tonalities&apos; with &apos;factor<br/>set&apos; in the entry for complete.</p><p>Further, &quot;basic&quot; and &quot;stellated&quot; would probably have been optimal in my<br/>original post.</p><p>Speaking of incomplete chords, the non m/n=2/1 CPSs are looking cool;<br/>check out the utonal triads in the 2)6 pentadekany (which I hadn&apos;t<br/>noticed until I found Co and Cu).</p><p>&gt;&gt;   N!             N!              N!<br/>&gt;&gt; -------  + -------------- + ------------<br/>&gt;&gt; M!(N-M)!   (M-2)!(1+N-M)!   (N-M-2)!(1+M)!<br/>&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt; ...but it looks like we&apos;re facing some negative factorials.  I also tried<br/>&gt;&gt; expressing it as a single fraction, but got some nasty polynomials.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;The first negative factorial results from dividing by (M-1), which<br/>&gt;is dividing by zero if M=1, so you mustn&apos;t do that.</p><p>Ah yes, I&apos;m aware.  As I said, I did find the correct common denominator...</p><p>&gt;           3       3<br/>&gt;  N!       (M + (N-M) - N) N!<br/>&gt;-------  + ------------------<br/>&gt;M!(N-M)!     (M+1)!(N-M+1)!</p><p>...but forgot how to distribute for cubes.  I had to go to bed, planned on<br/>looking it up tonight.  Thanks!  Now I have something to check my work<br/>against.  Like I said, I couldn&apos;t believe my basic algebra had slipped so<br/>far.</p><p>Looks like we have a winner.  John- what formula did you publish that was<br/>wrong?</p><p>-Carl</p></div>
