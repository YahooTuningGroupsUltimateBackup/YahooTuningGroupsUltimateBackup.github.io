Scott &#x3C;xjscott@earthlink.net&#x3E;</h3><span>7/17/2001 11:01:15 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>John,</p><p>First of all I agree that including the ability to<br/>optimize *away* from just is intriguing and I am<br/>pleased as punch that that capability was used<br/>(unbeknownst to me) in the first adaptatuned piece that<br/>I was batty about. Believe it or not, several months<br/>ago I was grousing to a certain other list member (who<br/>didn&apos;t really want to hear about it I am sure) about<br/>what I thought your program did and said that if I ever<br/>got around to making my own adaptive tuning program I<br/>would have it do things like maximize dissonance<br/>instead of consonance. I had made notes about such a<br/>system before -- the idea is you route the continuous<br/>value foot pedal or any other controller into the<br/>algorithm so that the composer can control the<br/>targetting -- pedal all the way one way targets low<br/>limit just intervals. Pedal all the other way targets<br/>the near-just region of maximum dissonance.</p><p>I think such capability could profitably and trivially<br/>easily be added to your program by routing pedal value<br/>to your spring coefficient. Pedal the one way is<br/>positive, the other way is negative. In the middle<br/>zero?? (Would that mean fixed to the target scale?)</p><p>Fun fun fun! I know there are some of you salivating<br/>over this as I speak.</p><p>Anyway, you&apos;re so close to doing this I thought I&apos;d<br/>toss it your way since it means I don&apos;t even have to<br/>thing about writing my own version to disprove your<br/>version -- your version sounds like it is becoming a<br/>all-inclusive general solution and thus extremely<br/>appealing. Go John!</p><p>&gt; Unused controllers, huh...  Are you referring to the RPN and<br/>&gt; NRPN guys, or to plain ol&apos; Bx xx xx messages?</p><p>CC sure is more convenient than PRN/NRPN as a lot of<br/>software (like the really old DOS and Atari stuff a lot<br/>of people say they are using) can not easily handle<br/>these messages (since you gotta send your MSB LSB and<br/>then data all the time and if you want to interleave<br/>messages, need to atomicize the sequence.) Best if the<br/>sequencer has this support built in. If you do<br/>recognize the [N]RPN messages, make sure you support<br/>use of either &amp; both these and CCs. No reason not to.</p><p>&gt; Are holes in the latter guaranteed to remain throughout time,<br/>&gt; I wonder?</p><p>Absolutely not no way no how!</p><p>&gt; Are they often overloaded by others?</p><p>In every single case without exception! :-)</p><p>I know a lot about this and so I will say FOR SURE that<br/>you should let the composer select whatever controllers<br/>he wants to use. You can make up some defaults if you<br/>like for a bit of standardization but definitly the<br/>composer should be able to override them. Why? Because<br/>most pro level instruments already let you redefine<br/>many the controllers anyway and so it is important to<br/>be able to route around CC #s that a composer is<br/>already using.</p><p>- Jeff</p></div><h3><a id=26353 href="#26353">ðŸ”—</a>John A. deLaubenfels &#x3C;jdl@adaptune.com&#x3E;</h3><span>7/20/2001 4:34:29 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Thanks, Jeff, for your detailed suggestions (now a couple of days ago,<br/>in: <a href="/tuning/topicId_26278.html#26278">/tuning/topicId_26278.html#26278</a> ).  If I&apos;m<br/>understanding you correctly, I&apos;d let my program do a first-pass tuning<br/>of a sequence, then as it was played in real-time, the composer (or<br/>sequencer) would use the foot-pedal to impose in essence a multiplier<br/>to all the deviations from 12-tET (this could include negative<br/>direction).  The program would apply this overtop the original plan,<br/>and save a new file with this action incorporated.</p><p>No, you&apos;re saying that I&apos;d need to calculate two sets of tunings for<br/>the piece, one maximally consonant and the other maximally dissonant,<br/>and the pedal would slide along that line, yes?  Very interesting!</p><p>Your thoughts on Continuous Controllers sound good.  I&apos;ve gotta go back<br/>and refresh my memory on MSB/LSB order; the LSB comes last, right?<br/>Wheee!</p><p>JdL</p></div>
