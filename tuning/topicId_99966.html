If you have flash, maybe you can hear it here:</p><p><a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b011txyb">http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b011txyb</a></p><p>They talked about his microtonal notation.  First they said<br/>he didn&apos;t notate the pitches precisely, and then described<br/>something that appeared to be 72 note equal temperament.<br/>They said he was aiming for sounds from the harmonic series.</p><p>Nothing I can find on the web sheds much light on his use<br/>of microtonality.  Let&apos;s see if anybody here knows anything.</p><p>                      Graham</p></div>
