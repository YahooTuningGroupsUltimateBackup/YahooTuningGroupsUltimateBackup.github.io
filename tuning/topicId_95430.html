It&apos;s lower in<br/>tenney height, but all of the dyads are higher in Tenney height than<br/>those of 14:18:21. This will probably make for music that has some<br/>interesting quirks, like that triads will be more concordant than<br/>dyads, as opposed to superpyth supermajor where it&apos;s the other way<br/>around. I personally find 10:13:15 to be more concordant overall than<br/>14:18:21 - it doesn&apos;t just sound like an annoyingly sharp 4:5:6, but<br/>like its own thing. Maybe that&apos;s just me.</p><p>Another interesting property is that it can be combined with the minor<br/>chord to make 10:12:13:15, which is decently well represented in<br/>19-tet (10:12:13 is better).</p><p>Anyway, the utonal inversion of 10:13:15 is 26:30:39, and although<br/>this is a sound I could probably get used to, it&apos;s close enough to<br/>6:7:9 to consider tempering. If we temper things so that 26:30:39 and<br/>6:7:9 get equated, and conversely so that 10:13:15 and 14:18:21 get<br/>equated, then we have decent triads both ways. This means that 91/90<br/>vanishes. That the comma vanishing is actually &quot;91/90&quot; makes me happy<br/>for very obvious and shallow reasons.</p><p>So let&apos;s say we have a <a href="http://2.3.7.13">2.3.7.13</a> subgroup temperament - tempering out<br/>91/90 puts us at rank 3. Another choice to bring us down to rank 2<br/>might be to temper out 64/63, and then we get a rank 2 &quot;ultrapyth&quot;<br/>tuning in which 27-equal seems like a pretty good choice.</p><p>Any other ideas based on this train of thought?</p><p>-Mike</p></div><h3><a id=95432 href="#95432">ðŸ”—</a>Mike Battaglia &#x3C;battaglia01@...&#x3E;</h3><span>1/6/2011 9:51:42 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>The last property, which I thought too obvious to mention but should<br/>probably include anyway for the sake of completeness, is that 10:13:15<br/>is roughly equivalent in Tenney height to the 5-limit minor triad.</p><p>Furthermore, the 5-limit minor triad also has a &quot;rooted&quot; counterpart<br/>at 16:19:24. There has long been a debate about which one is the<br/>&quot;real&quot; minor triad - since we don&apos;t usually play 10:12:15 in<br/>isolation, but with the root doubled several octaves down, it might be<br/>more that the perception of the minor triad is more related to<br/>1:2:4:8:16:19:24 than 5:10:20:40:48:60.</p><p>Likewise, the 13-limit ultramajor triad has a rooted counterpart at<br/>16:21:24. The difference between 19/16 and 6/5 is 18 cents; the<br/>difference between 21/16 and 13/10 is even less at 16.6 cents. The<br/>main difference is that 16:21 is closer to the 4:3 field of<br/>attraction, and that it&apos;s also generally perceived as a &quot;fourth&quot;; this<br/>would necessitate some clever musical context being used.</p><p>Lastly, 10:13:15 is one of a few triads with reasonable Tenney height<br/>that have a 3/2 as an outer dyad and where the lower two dyads are<br/>split relatively evenly; e.g. they are sized something like &quot;a third.&quot;<br/>Here&apos;s the list:</p><p>4:5:6 - 5-limit major triad<br/>6:7:9 - 7-limit subminor triad<br/>10:12:15 - 5-limit minor triad<br/>10:13:15 - **13-limit ultramajor triad**<br/>14:17:21 - **17-limit superminor triad**<br/>14:18:21 - 7-limit supermajor triad<br/>16:19:24 - 19-limit minor triad<br/>16:21:24 - doesn&apos;t really belong here, but maybe works as the 7-limit<br/>ultramajor triad if you can manage this via musical context</p><p>Anyway, 14:18:21 is already too hard for a lot of people to swallow as<br/>being concordant, so I&apos;ll stop it there. The only reason I went up to<br/>16:18:21 is because 16 is a power of 2, so if you&apos;re playing octave<br/>equivalent music you get a huge rootedness boost (since you can double<br/>the root up to 4 octaves in the bass without having to double the rest<br/>of the numbers in the triad).</p><p>There are only two triads in this list that aren&apos;t generally talked<br/>about much, and the lowest is 10:13:15. The next one is 14:17:21,<br/>which should be more absolutely concordant than 14:18:21, and is a<br/>&quot;superminor&quot; triad in the same way that 14:18:21 is a supermajor<br/>triad. Thus in terms of triads with a fifth on the outside, 10:13:15<br/>is the next logical xenharmonic choice to explore after 6:7:9.</p><p>This is assuming that you aren&apos;t immediately turned off by 10:13:15,<br/>as some have been - I guess it&apos;s one of those chords you either love<br/>or hate.</p><p>-Mike</p><p>On Fri, Jan 7, 2011 at 12:09 AM, Mike Battaglia &lt;battaglia01@...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt; Although the supermajor triad that everyone usually talks about is<br/>&gt; 14:18:21, 10:13:15 has some interesting properties.
