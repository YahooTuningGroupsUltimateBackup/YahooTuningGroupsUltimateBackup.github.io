But you&apos;ve now understood that it is extremely<br/>useful for our purposes, to treat rationals as vectors whose basis<br/>consists of logarithms of the prime numbers.

Now I think you have a very valid point. A monzo is a prime<br/>exponent vector which is a representation of a rational number.

It appears it is *not* the<br/>&gt; number<br/>&gt;&gt; but implies the full structure (prime space, etc.).<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Strings of digits, when interpreted as numbers, also carry structure,<br/>&gt; since you can add, subtract and multiply them, etc. The monzo carries<br/>&gt; the same structure as p-limit rational numbers under multiplication;<br/>&gt; ie, an abelian group structure, since they are a way of representing<br/>&gt; the p-limit rational numbers.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Nonetheless it is still<br/>&gt;&gt; a notation and in fact what it refers to is nothing new at all.  And<br/>&gt; thus I<br/>&gt;&gt; think it is misplaced to say that a &quot;monzo&quot; vanishes.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; This is a little like saying it is wrong to call the number &quot;C&quot; in<br/>&gt; hexidecimal &quot;twelve&quot;, isn&apos;t it? The monzo vanishes, the number<br/>&gt; vanishes, both mean the same thing. Nothing literally vanishes, and<br/>&gt; you could get picky about that also. What is important is to define<br/>&gt; your terms clearly enough that loose language can then do no harm.</p><p>I&apos;ll respond to that below...</p><p>&gt; For example there are<br/>&gt;&gt; alternate notations besides the prime-space mapping that work equally.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I would discount the idea that monzos are necessarily talking about<br/>&gt; prime-space. First, I&apos;d like to see prime-space clearly defined.</p><p>Right, prime space as used in the context of a monzo is simply rational<br/>space.  In some contexts prime space is purely multiplicative and so is<br/>identical with the set of positive integers.  But yes a definition and<br/>consistent use would be good.</p><p>&gt; The<br/>&gt;&gt; thing that vanishes does not depend on the choice of primes as the<br/>&gt; basis.<br/>&gt;&gt; But the &quot;monzo&quot; clearly does.  So the monzo is not the thing that<br/>&gt; vanishes.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; If I write &quot;12&quot;, interpreting it depends on knowing that it should be<br/>&gt; interpreted as a number base ten. That does not make it wrong to say<br/>&gt; &quot;12 is an even integer&quot;. It is also not wrong to say &quot;the roman<br/>&gt; numeral XII is an even integer&quot;.</p><p>It could be misleading though, if the term &quot;roman numeral&quot; were not<br/>introduced merely to disambiguate &quot;XII&quot;, and that&apos;s my point.  The evenness<br/>has nothing to do with it being roman, which relates to your point...</p><p>&gt; It *would* be wrong to think there<br/>&gt; are two kinds of numbers--roman and arabic.</p><p>Since in our culture &quot;12&quot; needs little disambiguation, I think it would be<br/>misleading to say &quot;the arabic number 12 is an even integer&quot;.  The statements<br/>made about monzo&apos;s sound like they are describing attributes of the monzo (a<br/>new notation).  Maybe it is the anti-&quot;promo&quot; in me (referring to Dave&apos;s<br/>joke) that doesn&apos;t want a whole branch of tuning math associated<br/>unnecessarily with a particular notation.  I think it *is* misleading and it<br/>makes people forget that the attributes being ascribed to things are<br/>completely independent of the monzo notational construct.  Rather it sounds<br/>like the whole branch of knowledge belongs to the monzo construct.  If<br/>indeed you have a kind of number whose only notation is the monzo then it is<br/>more appropriate to equate them, but that is not the case.</p><p>&gt;&gt; Since this is new terminology, I figure it is worth bringing these<br/>&gt; things<br/>&gt;&gt; up.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; We are getting perilously close to philosophy by this, however. :)</p><p>Ah, having fun yet?</p><p>-Kurt</p></div><h3>Carl Lumma &#x3C;ekin@lumma.org&#x3E;</h3><span>8/14/2004 4:24:13 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; In an odd-limit, there are more monzos than numbers.<br/>&gt;&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt;&gt; &gt;What in the world do you mean?<br/>&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt; There is no longer a 1:1 mapping between monzos and<br/>&gt;&gt; the rational numbers.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;This is false.
