It would<br/>&gt; be interesting to have some samples of his work.</p><p>I&apos;m sorry, I wasn&apos;t clear on that.  Erv stated to me (as I recall) that he was not a musician or composer, _not_ that he did not write or perform any music.  I was a professional musician at the time (but I am not, now).  I assumed he was merely acknowledging the relative time commitment to making music, from that point of view.

I don&apos;t like his films, so it&apos;s a quip.  I hope that distinction makes some sense, too.</p><p>&gt; Presumably you<br/>&gt; think at minimum you are a lot better than me.</p><p>Truly not so!
