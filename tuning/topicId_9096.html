These scales have not<br/>&gt;been successfully described by anyone. Since they are tuned by ear it<br/>&gt;seems reasonable (but not conclusive) that there is some sort of<br/>&gt;acoustical phenomenon going on.</p><p>Bill Sethares has done a lot of research on Indonesian scales, which you<br/>can read about in his book, &quot;Tuning, Timbre, Spectrum, Scale&quot;.  He<br/>relates the tunings used in Indonesian gamelans to minima in dissonance<br/>curves calculated from the instrument&apos;s non-integer partials.  If I<br/>remember correctly, he also gives examples of Indonesian tunings based<br/>on the minima in dissonance curves formed from the combination of<br/>non-integer partials from the gamelan instruments and integer partials<br/>(harmonics) from other instruments such as bowed stringed instruments<br/>that accompany the gamelan instruments.</p><p>You can read a little about his book at the following webpage:<br/><a href="http://eceserv0.ece.wisc.edu/~sethares/ttss.html">http://eceserv0.ece.wisc.edu/~sethares/ttss.html</a></p><p>Bill&apos;s homepage is:<br/><a href="http://eceserv0.ece.wisc.edu/~sethares/">http://eceserv0.ece.wisc.edu/~sethares/</a></p><p>I have read &quot;Tuning, Timbre, Spectrum, Scale&quot; and recommend it.</p><p>Cheers,<br/>Christopher</p></div><h3><a id=9116 href="#9116">ðŸ”—</a>Christopher J.

Do you have measurements<br/>of Indonesian instruments&apos; partials and tunings that are not consistent<br/>with his theory?
