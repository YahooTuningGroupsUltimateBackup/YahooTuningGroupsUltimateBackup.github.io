That&apos;s funny you call it a &quot;siren&quot;.  What that is is actually<br/>Robert Plant at the opening of &quot;Black Dog,&quot; slowed down about 20 times,<br/>without changing the pitch.  The guy was an amazing microtonal vocalist,<br/>as you can hear!!<br/>As for the &quot;tune&quot;----that was a pretty much a LISP tool I wrote that does<br/>random melodies within a scale, adding bends and so forth once in a while.<br/>The scales were derived from the &quot;chord&quot; that you hear towards the end of<br/>the piece.<br/>It was before I had a lot of experience and knowledge of microtonal<br/>theories &apos;n&apos; @#$%, so the scales I just picked by ear from a bunch of<br/>randomly generated ones.  I&apos;m pretty sure they don&apos;t fit into any<br/>theoretical paradigm.  They are, put simply, &quot;out of tune.&quot;</p><p>CB</p></div>
