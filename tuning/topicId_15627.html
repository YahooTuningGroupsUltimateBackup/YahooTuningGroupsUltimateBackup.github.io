So letting x=2 would gives the corresponding<br/>n-under series, and incrementally increasing the value of x by<br/>rationals works n towards ever more accurate approximations of its<br/>over series. If x=2+(sqrt(2)), the maximum underlying errors for any<br/>given fraction of &quot;n&quot; is only ~2&iuml;&iquest;&half;. This would be virtually<br/>indistinguishable from their corresponding n-tETs. Relaxing<br/>x=2+(sqrt(2)) so that x=3.5 allows for the simplest rational<br/>interpretation of an E-series.</p><p>Though I use three rational U/O-equal variations -- x=3, x=3.5, and<br/>x=4 which reset the 1:2^(1/2) as 5:7, 12:17, and 7:10 respectively --<br/>only the x=3.5 variation is essentially a rational &quot;well temperament&quot;<br/>of its corresponding n-tET. The x=3 and x=4 variations are more like<br/>some very colorful rational recasting of the corresponding n-tET, and<br/>could be said to represent a sort of O/U interpretational extreme.</p><p>Here&apos;s the U/O-equal series where x=3.5 and n=1,...,12 (note that the<br/>O/U-equal series are simply the inversions of these).</p><p>1/1 2/1</p><p>1/1 17/12 2/1</p><p>1/1 24/19 27/17 2/1</p><p>1/1 31/26 17/12 37/22 2/1</p><p>1/1 38/33 41/31 44/29 47/27 2/1</p><p>1/1 9/8 24/19 17/12 27/17 57/32 2/1</p><p>1/1 52/47 11/9 58/43 61/41 64/39 67/37 2/1</p><p>1/1 59/54 31/26 13/10 17/12 71/46 37/22 11/6 2/1</p><p>1/1 66/61 69/59 24/19 15/11 78/53 27/17 12/7 87/47 2/1</p><p>1/1 73/68 38/33 79/64 41/31 17/12 44/29 13/8 47/27 97/52 2/1</p><p>1/1 16/15 83/73 86/71 89/69 92/67 19/13 14/9 101/61 104/59 107/57 2/1</p><p>1/1 87/82 9/8 31/26 24/19 99/74 17/12 3/2 27/17 37/22 57/32 117/62 2/1</p><p>While I think most everyone would agree that these are not equal<br/>temperaments, they are all but sonically indistinguishable from<br/>them... and while I doubt that many would consider these to be JI<br/>scales or sets, they are both rational and derived by walking one<br/>series into the other...</p><p>November in New England is my favorite time of the year. When I&apos;m out<br/>hiking and I see the great gray skies churning through the now<br/>leafless trees, and I feel that crisp snap of early winter winds...<br/>everything just seems so super intense... the density of New England<br/>in November, the visceral physical and emotional impact... that&apos;s what<br/>I want to see and hear in music...</p><p>on a clear day you can see for miles!,</p><p>--Dan Stearns</p></div>
