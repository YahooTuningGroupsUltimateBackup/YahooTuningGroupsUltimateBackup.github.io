The chart at...</p><p>ftp://ella.mills.edu/ccm/tuning/papers/consist_limits.txt</p><p>...implies that it does, but I would guess that it does not, and that the<br/>chart really implies that .001 cent is enough resolution for the step size<br/>of equal temperaments, for practical purposes.</p><p>-Carl</p></div>
