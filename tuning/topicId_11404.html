I was in<br/>Vienna at the end of July and visited the collection of ancient music<br/>instruments in the Kunsthistorisches Museum. There are several citterns<br/>there, all of them with the same irregular pattern of straight frets. The<br/>instrument is bigger than a flat mandolin, but smaller than a lute. This is<br/>what I saw:</p><p>I         (first fret) higher than 12-tet, close to the 2nd fret<br/>II        lower<br/>III       higher<br/>IV        in between III and V<br/>V         OK (4:3?)<br/>VI        close to VII<br/>VII       OK (3:2?)<br/>VIII      higher than 12-tet<br/>IX and X  equally distant between VIII and XI<br/>XI        lower than 12-tet<br/>XII       OK (2:1)</p><p>The most beautiful cittern in the collection for sure is by Giralomo de<br/>Virchi (1574). According to The New Grove, the tuning of the six double<br/>courses was: d-f-b-g-d&apos;-e&apos;.<br/>I&apos;m looking right now to find the tablature music written for this special<br/>instrument by De Virchi&apos;s son, Paolo, in order to see what was the approach<br/>for the intonation.<br/>I think some clever brains on this list may already draw a conclusion from<br/>the tuning of the open courses, combined with the rough description of the<br/>placement of the frets...</p><p>In the same Kunsthistorisches Museum there was also a Harmonie-Hammerfl&uuml;gel,<br/>by Johann Jakob K&ouml;nnicke (Vienna, 1776). This instrument, presented as being<br/>&quot;31-tone&quot;, was played by Beethoven and Schubert. Mozart himself had one<br/>built. It has six identical manuals with 37 keys each. Starting from the<br/>left the first row of seven keys are marked as follows:<br/>Key 1 : three small dots<br/>Key 2 : three small dots<br/>Key 3 : no mark<br/>Key 4 : no mark<br/>Key 5 : a bigger round dot<br/>Key 6 : no mark<br/>Key 7 : no mark<br/>Than the pattern starts again, repeating until key 35. Then comes key 36 :<br/>three small dots, and key 37 : three small dots as well. That makes one of<br/>the six manuals. The museum doesn&apos;t give any other description how the<br/>instrument was tuned.</p><p>--Wim Hoogewerf</p></div>
