Lindley notes that some writings of this era use the<br/>fractional exponents of Nicolas Oresme (14th century), a notation<br/>which Lindley finds not especially helpful, most likely, to the<br/>musicians of the time.</p><p>At the same time, Paul, I agree with you that temperaments and the<br/>like are often distinguished in good part precisely by dispersing<br/>certain commas or distinctions found in many just systems.</p><p>I&apos;d consider it a very important feature of meantone that it tempers<br/>out the 81:80 (4 fifths up = 5:4), of 22-EDO that it tempers out the<br/>64:63 (4 fifths up = ~9:7), and of 46-EDO that it tempers out the<br/>896:891 (4 fifths up = ~14:11).</p><p>Here we&apos;re doing something more than simply emulating a classic JI<br/>system based on the applicable ratios: we&apos;re setting up certain<br/>equivalences.</p><p>Anyway, the &quot;temperament by ratio&quot; concept really has me fascinated<br/>nowadays: your famous Aristoxenian decision in one piece for a minor<br/>third around 279 cents, then realized as a 75:64 (~274.58 cents), is a<br/>fine example.</p><p>As far as this &quot;tempering by ratio&quot; goes, the English organ tuning<br/>described in a treatise of 1373 could be a fine historical<br/>example. Diatonic notes are Pythagorean, with accidentals added by a<br/>division of 18:17:16.</p><p>One result is the &quot;bisecting&quot; of the Pythagorean comma into two parts,<br/>although I&apos;m not sure that this was the main motivation for the<br/>tuning, and the two &quot;odd&quot; fifths are still impure by about 15 cents<br/>and 9 cents, as I recall.</p><p>Since most fifths are still pure, one could call this &quot;JI&quot; from a<br/>Keenan-like viewpoint (in a context where a complete 2:3:4 trine<br/>represents saturated stable concord).</p><p>Maybe I could sum up three possible approaches to musical dilemmas of<br/>the kind often inviting temperament:</p><p>              (1) Leave as many intervals as possible pure,<br/>                  and let the others be as impure as they<br/>                  turn out with these arrangement;</p><p>              (2) Let all relevant intervals be slightly<br/>                  and equally impure, as in a regular<br/>                  temperament; or</p><p>              (3) Let some intervals remain pure, and others<br/>                  be compromised more gently than in (1), but<br/>                  more noticeably than in (2).</p><p>If (3) is realized through rational intonation (RI), then we have a<br/>kind of tuning which might incorporate aspects of both JI and<br/>temperament.</p><p>Most appreciatively,</p><p>Margo Schulter<br/><a href="mailto:mschulter@value.net">mschulter@value.net</a></p></div><h3><a id=35596 href="#35596">ðŸ”—</a>genewardsmith &#x3C;genewardsmith@juno.com&#x3E;</h3><span>3/11/2002 10:19:06 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In tuning@y..., &quot;M.
