Here are some of the best Christmas<br/>&gt;MIDI-files I&apos;ve found:</p><p>&gt;<a href="http://www.lockergnome.com/midi/holiday.html">http://www.lockergnome.com/midi/holiday.html</a></p><p>&gt;PLEASE do &apos;The 12 Days of Christmas&apos; - this arrangement is great!</p><p>Consider it done!  I&apos;ve downloaded, tuned, and uploaded, four pieces:</p><p>   holynite: Oh Holy Night.  A lovely, if untraditional, arrangement.<br/>      Unfortunately, a few of the notes overflowed the channel limit,<br/>      and didn&apos;t make it into the retunings in noticeable places, yet,<br/>      IMHO, it&apos;s still lovely (it almost works as if the gaps had been<br/>      left for the listener to fill in in imagination).</p><p>   green: Greensleeves.  I&apos;m not crazy about this arrangement myself,<br/>      but it&apos;s imaginative.</p><p>   silent: Silent Night.  A carol that I love.  Nice arrangement.</p><p>   12days: Twelve Days of Christmas.  Very funny arrangement, with<br/>      modulations and voice alterations; must hear to believe.</p><p>For once, I&apos;m not going to push 7-limit (Paul E, are you suitably<br/>shocked?).  They&apos;re still my favorites, but most listeners will probably<br/>find 5-limit sufficiently sweet without the potential shock of those<br/>very flat sevenths.  Both options are included, along with the original<br/>12-tET.</p><p>Merry Xmas, everyone, whatever your particular religious persuasion!!</p><p>JdL</p></div><h3>Monz &#x3C;MONZ@JUNO.COM&#x3E;</h3><span>12/20/2000 10:32:16 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@egroups.com">tuning@egroups.com</a>, &quot;John A. deLaubenfels&quot; &lt;jdl@a...&gt; wrote:</p><p>&gt; Consider it done!

I think that once seven gets into your head, it becomes, as<br/>David Finnamore said, something you don&apos;t want to leave &quot;home&quot; without.<br/>When I started tuning, it took a significant time before seven seemed<br/>acceptable to me, but that&apos;s all in the past now!  Every now and then<br/>I come across a sequence that I think sounds better in five, but often<br/>on second hearing I change my mind and prefer it in seven instead.</p><p>[Monz wrote:]<br/>&gt;It just so happens that you picked my four favorites of all<br/>&gt;the files on this page.

I don&apos;t find an<br/>attribution in the sequence.  What&apos;s that at the end?  It sounds like<br/>Nintendo&apos;s Mario being whipped by one of the dragons.</p><p>JdL</p></div>
