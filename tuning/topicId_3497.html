SHORT, it&apos;s hard for me to tell whether the tuning<br/>&gt; seems right or not.</p><p>Yes, I know.  I&apos;ve posted something about this.<br/>I&apos;ll eventually get around to finishing it.</p><p>&gt; (please note the extreme irony in my complaining<br/>&gt; that your sequence is too short, I who am virtually unable to<br/>&gt; play keyboard from a score...).</p><p>Yeah, well, I don&apos;t play anything in from a keyboard either,<br/>because I don&apos;t have one anymore (all stolen).  I use the<br/>click-the-mouse-on-the-staff-one-note-at-a-time method.<br/>Slow and painful, but it (eventually) gets the job done,<br/>and my durations are always accurate!  :)</p><p>One thing that really infurates me about MIDI sequences that<br/>many others make (as downloadable from Classical MIDI Archives,<br/>for example) is that they play them in on a keyboard with<br/>lots of rubato, but their sequencer has no way to keep track<br/>of where the beats fall, so when you look at the MIDI sequence,<br/>the rhythmic notation looks nothing like the original score.</p><p>This lessens the value of their future use and modification<br/>for me.</p><p>I use lots of rubato in the Tempo window to do all that,<br/>retaining the original meters and rhythms.</p><p>&gt; I actually like Beethoven&apos;s mad spirit, except that it seems not<br/>&gt; fully leavened with sweetness most of the time.  Brahms can be<br/>&gt; every bit as stormy as Beethoven, but he always mixes in some<br/>&gt; wonderful lyricism.</p><p>I have to disagree there.  I think the impression of the<br/>never-lyrical Beethoven is a perception resulting from inaccurate<br/>performance.  Give a listen to the &apos;Cavatina&apos; slow movement from<br/>his Bb Quartet op. 130 (Beethoven himself cried when he thought<br/>about this movement - it&apos;s one of the most deeply moving pieces<br/>I know of), or for a more well-known example, the slow movement<br/>from the 9th Symphony.</p><p>Of course, you didn&apos;t say that Beethoven is *never* lyrical,<br/>and I think that often a whole movement may lack lyricism,<br/>but it fits in with his &apos;program&apos;.  One thing Beethoven&apos;s music<br/>has more than most other composers&apos;s is a profound logic and<br/>a sense of inevitability.</p><p>I didn&apos;t mean to imply that I disagree about Brahms.<br/>However...</p><p>&gt; (which MAY be because Brahms had a steady stream of girlfriends,<br/>&gt; whereas poor Beethoven was apparently celibate most or all of his<br/>&gt; life...)</p><p>I&apos;m not so sure about that.  No-one knows for sure, and the<br/>facts about this will probably never be discovered, considering<br/>all the research that&apos;s been done into Beethoven&apos;s life by now.<br/>But its on the record that there were *many* women who were<br/>attracted to him, even tho he was considered ugly and somewhat<br/>crazy.  He himself was frequently under the delusion that he<br/>had found a &apos;suitable mate&apos; (to use Partch&apos;s words...).<br/>Most of the time the reason the &apos;wedding plans&apos; fell thru<br/>was simply because of a difference in social standing: Beethoven<br/>associated with members of the aristocracy, and these were all<br/>aristocratic women, while he was but a lowly composer...</p><p>&gt; Do you like the idea of a &quot;tune-off&quot;?  Do you have any complete<br/>&gt; MIDI (single-voice) sequences you would like to see bent?</p><p>Sure.  There&apos;s some piano stuff of mine on my &apos;List of Works&apos;<br/>webpage that you might try retuning:</p><p>Springtime Rag<br/>Etude in F#<br/>Sonatina<br/>Waltz</p><p>When you say &apos;single voice&apos;, do you mean also &apos;one track&apos;?<br/>Some of these may have more than one track, but they are all<br/>one voice, so the tracks could be combined into one if necessary.</p><p>-monz</p><p>Joseph L.
