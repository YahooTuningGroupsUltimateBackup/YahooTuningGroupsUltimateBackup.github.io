Schiff has written some perceptive stuff this last year or<br/>so, some of the articles having been included in prominent places in the<br/>New York Times...</p><p>It seems that Schiff goes for the &quot;weird&quot; approach in order to keep Ives<br/>from the trodden &quot;mainstream.&quot;  In this sense, he means it as an<br/>accolade...  There certainly is a big difference in a consideration of Ives<br/>as a &apos;great- American- composer- genius- wonderful- offbeat-weirdo- wacko&apos;<br/>and Ives as a &apos;part-time- amateur- musician- wacko- Insurance-<br/>Executive&apos;...</p><p>The latter was, of course, an early view of Ives.  By the time of the<br/>William Austin book of 1966, which is not flattering at all, even this view<br/>had changed.  There is every sense in William Austin&apos;s book that Ives<br/>should be taken seriously as a composer and not a crank.  He does &quot;crank<br/>up&quot; such magnificently damning statements as &quot;Without the prose,<br/>unfortunately, much of the music fails to make any clear effect...&quot;</p><p>I guess the point was whether anybody in the 21st century could really make<br/>that kind of statement and be taken seriously as an &quot;evaluator&quot; of Ives.<br/>To me, anyway, it seems Ives insurance &quot;stock&quot; has gone way up... and some<br/>of William Austin&apos;s statements would not be made at the present time.</p><p>Dan could have a point, though, in his statement that such opinions are<br/>&quot;waves&quot; -- a bull and bear market in Ives&apos; futures, so to speak....</p><p>______________   ________  _____  ___  __  _<br/>Joseph Pehrson</p></div>
