The 10-chime set came on a<br/>holder which held 6 chimes at a time, and they were intended to be in the<br/>same 6-tone sets as the windchimes they produce in their factory (they<br/>only had three pentatonic scales way back then).  The lowest and highest<br/>tones were 3/2 (their more current literature shows it as 1/1 in the key of<br/>D, instead of 3/2 in the key of G).  All three pentatonic scales used<br/>3/2, 1/1, 9/8 and 3/2 (D, G, A, D).
