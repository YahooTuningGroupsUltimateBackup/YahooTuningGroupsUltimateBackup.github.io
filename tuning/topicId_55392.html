The<br/>first one I tried turned out by coincidence to be epimorphic, which is what<br/>I want, but it may not be in other respects as good as some other<br/>possibilities.  However it will be a lot of work to find good scales among<br/>the many possibilities and I think that Gene and perhaps others on tuning<br/>math might have some preliminary results that might answer questions such<br/>as:</p><p>What are the &quot;best&quot; 12-tone 7-limit epimorphic scales?  (I&apos;m interested in<br/>any sense of &quot;best&quot; that anyone else might want to entertain.)</p><p>Do any of these have good approximations of 11-limit intervals that are<br/>actually useful for creating 11-limit chords?  Or is this too much to ask of<br/>a 12-tone scale?</p><p>Also:  scala uses the term &quot;JI epimorphic&quot; I believe.  Is this different<br/>from just &quot;epimorphic&quot;?</p><p>Thanks for any help.</p><p>-Kurt</p></div><h3>Gene Ward Smith &#x3C;gwsmith@svpal.org&#x3E;</h3><span>8/10/2004 12:23:10 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, Kurt Bigler &lt;kkb@b...&gt; wrote:</p><p>&gt; What are the &quot;best&quot; 12-tone 7-limit epimorphic scales?

The most obvious way to give the scale<br/>precisely would be as a 5-limit scale, but then we are back to<br/>JI-epimorphic.
