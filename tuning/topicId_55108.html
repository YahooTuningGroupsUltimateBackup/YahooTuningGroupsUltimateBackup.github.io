Anyway, a few years ago, when working<br/>with digitized sound, I was studiing such things like &quot;ring modulation&quot; in<br/>great detail (I mean the effect of multipliing two signals by each other)<br/>and I think I could give an interesting point for you here which may more or<br/>less explain the matter you spoke about.<br/>If you have a chance to find some detailed papers about acoustics or some<br/>good software for working with it, you may find out that mixing two sine<br/>waves of frequencies of X and Y (if Y is lower) is just the same as<br/>multiplying a sine wave of &quot;(X+Y)/2&quot; with a cosine wave of &quot;(X-Y)/2&quot;. You<br/>can also take it from the other side and say that multipliing a sine wave of<br/>X with a cosine wave of Y is the same as mixing two sine waves whose<br/>frequencies are &quot;X+Y&quot; and &quot;X-Y&quot;. This explains why you heard quartertones<br/>while playing two tones a semitone apart. I don&apos;t know if you have a<br/>possibility to take sine waves through some distortion effect, but I can<br/>highly recommend experimenting with this. Overdriving a single sine wave<br/>results in something which sounds a bit like a square wave. But suppose you<br/>mix two sine waves of 100Hz and 120Hz both at the same volume. When you pass<br/>this through an overdriving effect, you&apos;ll get a feeling that you can hear<br/>110Hz with very quick tremolo. In fact, 110Hz is the frequency between the<br/>two that you mixed and the tremolo is the difference of 20Hz. If you,<br/>instead of mixing two sines of 100Hz and 120Hz, multiply a 110Hz sine with a<br/>10Hz cosine, you get just the same.<br/>Hope this helps.<br/>Petr</p></div><h3><a id=55212 href="#55212">ðŸ”—</a>Kurt Bigler &#x3C;kkb@breathsense.com&#x3E;</h3><span>8/4/2004 6:17:19 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>on 8/4/04 12:52 PM, Petr Par&iacute;zek &lt;<a href="mailto:p.parizek@tiscali.cz">p.parizek@tiscali.cz</a>&gt; wrote:</p><p>&gt; From: &quot;Kurt Bigler&quot; &lt;kkb@b&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt; I just discovered that in the lowest notes on my piano I can simulate<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt; quarter-tones by playing two adjacent notes simultaneously.

Most often I saw describing the ilimba as a<br/>&quot;thumb piano&quot;. The hole used for sound amplification is usually covered with<br/>a very soft membrane (somewhere on the web I found that this can be made,<br/>for example, from spider cocoon fibres) and this makes the tones sound very<br/>much like if they were overdriven electronically, though they aren&apos;t. It&apos;s<br/>amazing, professional musicians use external amplifiers and effect units to<br/>achieve such a thing, and somewhere in East Africa, they get it without any<br/>amplifiers or pickups. Moreover, they play mostly otonal music which sounds<br/>really sweet through this &quot;acoustic overdrive&quot;. For example, Hukwe Zawose<br/>from Tanzania, who is my favorite ilimba player, almost always used a scale<br/>of ratios 6:7:8:9:10:12. The intervals between consecutive tones in this<br/>scale have mostly the same difference tone between them (i.e. the relative<br/>frequency of 1) so it sounds really wonderful if this is distorted.<br/>Petr</p></div>
