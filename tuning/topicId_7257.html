I don&apos;t think you explained on the air<br/>how you consider them to be similar beyond the number of syllables in their<br/>last names, and wondered if you (or anyone else) might like to do so for<br/>the list.</p><p>John Link</p><p>****************************************************************************</p><p>Watch for the CD &quot;Live at Saint Peter&apos;s&quot; by the JOHN LINK VOCAL QUINTET,<br/>featuring original compositions as well as arrangements of instrumental<br/>music by Brahe and Taylor, Chick Corea, Miles Davis, Claude Debussy, Bill<br/>Evans, Ennio and Andrea Morricone, Modeste Mussorgsky, Erik Satie, and Earl<br/>Zindars.</p><p>****************************************************************************</p><p>Check out <a href="http://WWW.DUESBERG.COM">WWW.DUESBERG.COM</a> for information that could make the difference<br/>between life and death for you or someone you know.</p><p>****************************************************************************</p></div><h3><a id=7287 href="#7287">ðŸ”—</a>Afmmjr@xxx.xxx</h3><span>12/26/1999 2:34:44 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Thank you John for your responding to the show.  My guest Carol Baron, author<br/>of a new article on Ives and Bach was responsible for making the connection.<br/>As I recall (and there are tapes) it was pointed out that they were both<br/>professional organists from small towns.  Both had fathers who were<br/>professional musicians.  Both used the idea of systems to compose.  Ives&apos;s<br/>early studies were based squarely on Bach.</p><p>And most important for the radio program, both heard subtleties of intonation<br/>in their imagination that was expressed by a notation that can be<br/>interpretted in different ways.  The recordings demonstrate an idealized<br/>performance for both composers.</p><p>Also, please consider, I had the opportunity to present Ives through the<br/>offices of Bach.  I tried to be graceful.</p><p>Johnny Reinhard<br/>AFMM</p></div>
