Some of those values do not<br/>come directly from the 18:23:28:33 but from neiboughring intervals<br/>that are simpler such as 7:9 which is 10 some ten cents above 18:23.</p><p>The &quot;brute force method&quot; is this: I put all the chord harmonic values<br/>(473,95*1, 473*2... 606,142*1 606,142*2 etc.) on an excel spreadsheet,<br/>sort them and search for those which are nearer to each other than a<br/>given threashold, let say 35 Hz. Let say that 18 is A, 23 is B 28 is C<br/>and 33 is D (nothing to do with the notes of scale) and notate An the<br/>nth harmonics of A (e.g. A10 = 4739,5 Hz). Thus, for instance A14:C9<br/>denotate the beat of the 14th harmonic of the root against the 9th<br/>harmonic of the &quot;fifth*5&quot;.</p><p>In the table below there are the beating frequencies up to 14 kH for a<br/>(rather large) threshold of 40 Hz for beating frequencies. The first<br/>column designate the harmonic pairs. Fc is the central frequency (Fx +<br/>Fy)/2 and Fb is the beat frequency (Fx-Fy). A * in first column<br/>denotate Hpair that belongs to the intended 18:23:28:33 chord.</p><p> Hpair        Fc      Fb<br/>------------------------<br/> A7:B9     4254,3  22,55<br/>*A11:D6    5215,5   4,15<br/> B10:A7    6074,5  25,78<br/>*A14:C9    6631,2   8,24<br/> A14:B11   6651,4  32,26<br/> C13:D11   9569,0   6,82<br/> B17:C14  10306,6   4,35<br/>*A22:D12  10431,0   8,30<br/> A23:B18  10905,7   9,70<br/>*A28:C18  13262,4  16,48</p><p>So it may occur that some contribution to roughness come from dyads<br/>that are foreign to the 18:23:28:33.</p><p>If the chord is lowered by an octave, all the figures above (Fc and<br/>Fb) should be divided by two. Further, if we take the same threshold<br/>for a lowered chord, new contribution to roughness may appear at even<br/>lower frequencies from even simpler ratio. For instance, an octave<br/>below, 18:28 may start to lose its &quot;personality&quot; and sound more as an<br/>out of tune 2:3 as a 25Hz beat starts to be audible around 724 Hz; or<br/>may be it will just add the ruggosity that gives the extra &quot;jazzyness&quot;<br/>and delighfull ambiguity.</p><p>yours truly</p><p>Fran&ccedil;ois Laferri&egrave;re</p><p>--- In tuning@y..., &quot;M.
