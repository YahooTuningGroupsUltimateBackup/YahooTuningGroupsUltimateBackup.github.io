It _does take effort and<br/>concentration to both be excited by new musical happenings and to also want<br/>them.<br/>I think it&apos;s all summed up by an observation from Thomas Beecham which goes<br/>something like: &quot;Very few people love music, but the _do love the noise it<br/>makes.&quot;<br/> At 10:46 PM 10/17/00 -0600, you wrote:<br/>&gt;   Dan&apos;s post about the future of music is the kind of thing I like to<br/>&gt;see...I recently read a good Pat Mehteny interview in a local mag, and<br/>&gt;here&apos;s a few quotes about the state of jazz today...&quot;There was a fairly<br/>&gt;strong movement in the early &apos;80&apos;s, for the first time in jazz history,<br/>&gt;to go back in time with the music.&quot; Later...&quot;I generally resist the<br/>&gt;whole idea of jazz becoming repertory music in a certain style, the same<br/>&gt;way that Baroque music was a certain style with very clear parameters.&quot;<br/>&gt;And...&quot;Someone like Wynton Marsalis, when he was young, decided to put<br/>&gt;on a suit, act older and play for older people.&quot;<br/>&gt;    I posted this because the present state of jazz is awful...when I<br/>&gt;listen to the radio, I can&apos;t tell if I am hearing a piece from 1950 or<br/>&gt;2000..the guys today are really going backwards, instead of forwards,<br/>&gt;just like Metheny is saying.
