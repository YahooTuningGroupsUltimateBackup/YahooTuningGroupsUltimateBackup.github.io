Melody and melodic continuity doesn&apos;t have to be bound to a scale at all- a percieved scale or scales can arise from melodic figures. Or tetrachords (abstracted, &quot;ajnas&quot;, really) can interlock. They&apos;re the structure, the scales percieved later are kind of &quot;byproducts&quot;. See Kalle&apos;s post- and what he says doesn&apos;t just apply to &quot;classical&quot; music.</p></div><h3>Jake Freivald &#x3C;jdfreivald@...&#x3E;</h3><span>3/30/2012 11:54:06 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Hans said:</p><p>&gt; Here is a 22edo composition of mine exploring these ideas<br/>&gt; (it was my contribution to the 2011 Untwelve competition):<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; <a href="https://share.ols.inode.at/ASJRF10WVXSCUTZF14OZ58LWJM1HS0Y33IUII4EE">https://share.ols.inode.at/ASJRF10WVXSCUTZF14OZ58LWJM1HS0Y33IUII4EE</a></p><p>This is a great piece, Hans!
