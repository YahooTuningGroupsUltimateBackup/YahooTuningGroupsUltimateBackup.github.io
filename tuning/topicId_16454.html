There was a great story in &quot;The Real<br/>&gt;Frank Zappa Book&quot; about Zappa having the late Slonimsky over to his<br/>&gt;house, where he explained this concept to Zappa.</p><p>Apparently Slonimsky came onstage with the Mothers soon after that and played a solo piano piece - he was amused but apparently a good sport...</p><p>&gt;I have explored this book too. I used to fancy that it represented a<br/>&gt;sort of Raga book of Western Music.</p><p>Interesting idea...</p><p>The book is absolutely still in print; you can get it from Amazon for about $22.</p><p>Anyway realized I hadn&apos;t properly introduced myself; I signed on here about two weeks ago and have been enjoying myself thoroughly - I&apos;m a composer from NH but living in NY; got into the microtonal hooey (probably like most) by way of Ives &amp; Partch though I haven&apos;t had much opportunity to use it in my own writing...As a side note, I&apos;m putting on a small chamber music concert up at Columbia in early spring &amp; we could use a few more works if anyone&apos;s interested (email me offlist). We&apos;ll have fl, cl, vln, vla, vc, alto sax, tbone, percussion, &amp; turntables on hand.</p><p>Nice to meet y&apos;all. :)</p><p>Franz</p><p>_____________________________________________________________________________________<br/>Get more from the Web.

If one could<br/>memorize all the patterns (and then use them musically), they would<br/>indeed be a bad motorcycle. And yes, Coltrane, as well as many others,<br/>have studied from it. Slonimsky named his cat Grody to the Max after<br/>hanging with the Zappa&apos;s.
