You could output your results, e.g., into Csound scores or MIDI files (e.g., distributing the pitches over multiple channel). For 12 ET, there exist examples for two voice species counterpoint and for florid counterpoint which you can use as a starting point.</p><p>But then again, Strasheela&apos;s user interface is a programming language -- not everyone&apos;s cup of tea :)</p><p>Best<br/>Torsten</p><p>--<br/>Torsten Anders<br/>Interdisciplinary Centre for Computer Music Research<br/>University of Plymouth<br/>Office: +44-1752-586219<br/>Private: +44-1752-558917<br/><a href="http://strasheela.sourceforge.net">http://strasheela.sourceforge.net</a><br/><a href="http://www.torsten-anders.de">http://www.torsten-anders.de</a></p></div>
