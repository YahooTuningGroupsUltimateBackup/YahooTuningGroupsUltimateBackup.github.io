I do have a different view, in<br/>some regards.</p><p>Arp Schnitger built organs in Hamburg, Magdeburg, and throughout<br/>Friesland...but not in Dutch-speaking Nederland.  Dutch-speaking Nederland is<br/>clear to me as a bastion of quarter-comma meantone, which would be fine for<br/>Caspar Schnitger.</p><p>Split-keyed quarter-comma meantone is &quot;Werckmeister II,&quot; described by<br/>Werckmeister as an incorrect approach.  The Hamburg St. Jacobi Church was<br/>reputed to be built by Arp and it was tuned to equal temperament (read<br/>well-temperament, and likely Werckmeister III).  Remember Bach auditioned for<br/>Reinkein here.  As there was no &quot;equal temperament&quot; in the day, that church<br/>is today in Werckmeister III.</p><p>Yes, as to friends, I agree that we hold different standards, as people are<br/>wont to do. Writing a poem to Werckmeister takes a bit of a focus on a person<br/>that would lead me to suspect a &quot;friendship.&quot;</p><p>Your article does not mention Buxtehude, really.  And yet, his music in<br/>Werckmeister III tuning fits like a glove.  And history does consider his W&apos;s<br/>friend.  W had spent some time in Lubeck.</p><p>And then there is Groningen which was tuned to WIII in 1705.</p><p>best, Johnny Reinhard</p></div>
