The book teaches 72-note-to-the-octave equal temperament. After an<br/>introduction to the notation, subsequent assignments will guide us through<br/>playing and writing melody, harmony, and by the end of the book up to 6-part<br/>counterpoint. Our examples will be played and sung by the class, developing<br/>our ability to hear and discern these unique intervals.<br/>The class is inspired by and modeled after the &quot;Microtonal Composition and<br/>Theory&quot; class taught by Joe Maneri at The New England Conservatory. The<br/>class is open to all instrumentalists, singers, composers and theorists from<br/>jazz, classical and any other stylistic background. Students should have a<br/>background in basic music theory.

Hopefully, they will contribute to enthusiasm for 72-tET in<br/>the New York area.</p><p>Being a person involved in 72-tET and who uses the Sims notation, I<br/>will naturally be interested in these developments.  I&apos;m not certain,<br/>at this point, whether I will attend the full 8-week sessions, but,<br/>certainly, I am interested in finding out what is going on.  And, I<br/>already have the text.</p><p>As a composer, I have rather ambivalent feelings toward &quot;ear<br/>training.&quot;  I had *conventional* &quot;ear training&quot; up the wazoo and I<br/>must confess that almost none of it contributed to my composing in<br/>the least.  In fact, if anything it *inhibited* it.</p><p>One thing &quot;ear training&quot; never takes into consideration is *context*<br/>which means *everything* from a compositional standpoint.  Microtonal<br/>chorales and exercises may help people listen and identify the<br/>intervals, but, in my experience the *best* microtonal ear training<br/>for composers is to WRITE MUSIC, and lots of it.</p><p>It also helps to have an accurately tuned synthesizer, an acute ear<br/>and, hopefully, some talent.</p><p>I&apos;ve been working to establish a nice rapport with Julia Werntz, so I<br/>don&apos;t want to disrupt that in any way, but I must confess there were<br/>a few items on her PARIS microtonal article with which I would take<br/>issue:</p><p>The slant of the article meant to show that since certain composers<br/>used lower-integer harmonic intervals, those really *weren&apos;t*<br/>microtonality.  A student who couldn&apos;t hear microtonality in the work<br/>of Harry Partch was cited as an example.</p><p>In the first place, anybody who can&apos;t hear microtonality in Harry<br/>Partch is *really, seriously* in need of &quot;ear training.&quot; That&apos;s not<br/>much substantiation, right there...</p><p>In the second place, again *context* means everything and while it is<br/>true that Just Intonation intervals approximate our &quot;conventional&quot;<br/>ones to a great degree, I would say that 1)they still sound quite a<br/>bit different and, even more importantly 2) due to the nature of the<br/>scales that are used, the *harmonic progressions* are totally<br/>different from our &quot;standard practice&quot; harmonic music.</p><p>Take Blackjack, for example.  The &quot;progressions&quot; while *harmonic* are<br/>nothing like conventional common practice.  They are mostly<br/>constructed by going around the Blackjack lattice and while they may<br/>be vaguely emulated by 12-tET, the *impetus* for the succession of<br/>chords has nothing to do with 12-equal or conventional theory.</p><p>In addition, the use of *small* intervals in Blackjack gives it a<br/>*thoroughly* microtonal cast.  I find the use of these, in<br/>*combination* with harmonic intervals to be the particular interest<br/>of the scale and something that can create music that has a bit of<br/>the past (although with &quot;improved&quot; and slightly strange intervals)<br/>with small &quot;added note&quot; pitches that are a totally new vocabulary.</p><p>So, different people have different ways of working and, personally,<br/>I would never for a moment try to define what &quot;real microtonality&quot; is<br/>or is not for anybody.</p><p>That&apos;s work for the &quot;critics&quot; anyway.  They&apos;ve been proven over time<br/>to be always right...  :)</p><p>cordially,</p><p>Joe Pehrson</p></div><h3>Graham Breed &#x3C;graham@microtonal.co.uk&#x3E;</h3><span>2/7/2003 7:22:39 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Joseph Pehrson  wrote:</p><p>&gt; One thing &quot;ear training&quot; never takes into consideration is *context* &gt; which means *everything* from a compositional standpoint.
