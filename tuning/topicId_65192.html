Personally, I would be more interested in hearing what potential the tradition has for further development. For example, why should it be limited to the two-to-four-minute-long song format, or to repertoire that has dropped out of copyright, or to seven limit harmonies?  I could easily imagine that a barbershop quartet could do fantastic things with, say, Roy Orbison&apos;s _In Dreams_, a song with a formal shape quite unlike  the standard song repertoire. And William Brooks&apos; setting of Foster&apos;s _Nellie Was A Lady_ in his extended vocal technique _Madrigals_ demonstrates potential of another sort.</p></div><h3><a id=65195 href="#65195">ðŸ”—</a>Daniel Wolf &#x3C;djwolf@snafu.de&#x3E;</h3><span>3/8/2006 11:31:05 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Jon wrote:</p><p>&quot;I think the problem for Gene, and this may always be the case, is that<br/>in many circumstances musical terminology is _not_ as codified,<br/>ossified, and concrete as mathematical terminology.

If you have the right frame of mind, this can be a perfectly acceptable state of affairs, as music is, in the end, a subjective and aesthetic experience, and -- so long as they are pursued with internal coherence and honesty -- each theoretical/musicological project has the potential to bring out features or qualities that competing projects simply miss.

Do be aware that<br/>quartets today do and have done music much newer<br/>than copyright expired music, probably well over<br/>the majority of the music sung is still copyrighted,<br/>not THAT old.  On top of that, further stylistic things<br/>like Roy Orbison arrangements are and have been done.</p><p>In addition to all of that, I fully, strongly agree<br/>that it is worthwhile to explore further tonalities<br/>and styles and even opening up exploring new<br/>combinations of ensembles, using the barbershop<br/>quartet traditions to whatever degree.  I&apos;m with you<br/>on that.</p><p>Like anything, it is hard to pin down this sort of<br/>society into one simple view.  Within the society,<br/>there are both conservative traditionalists who<br/>preserve a mythical view of the tradition, as well<br/>as experimental composers who are interested in<br/>incorporating all sorts of things (I&apos;m one of those).</p><p>The way I look at it, it&apos;s like this: besides<br/>sometimes oversimplifying, even the best attempts<br/>at &quot;preservation&quot; of a style can only preserve those<br/>elements that we can easily write down or notate or<br/>describe.  Everything else will get lost over time.<br/>But because this leaves gaps in the expressiveness of<br/>the music, those gaps will be filled in by equally hard<br/>to describe (but not necessarily similar) elements that<br/>help create expressive complete music.  Today&apos;s top<br/>quartets have a new sound that is unlike anything<br/>previous.  This is just how things go.</p><p>The main thing that draws me and I believe most<br/>barbershoppers is simply the focus on harmony,<br/>whereas most music leaves harmony as a background<br/>element.  But not just that focus, it&apos;s the<br/>harmonic and carefully tuned, matched sound that is<br/>what&apos;s so neat.</p><p>-Aaron</p></div><h3><a id=65203 href="#65203">ðŸ”—</a>Carl Lumma &#x3C;clumma@yahoo.com&#x3E;</h3><span>3/8/2006 12:21:36 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>&gt; &quot;Today, the society laments that this fact<br/>&gt; of our history is the reason we have lost some of the african-<br/>&gt; american tradition.
