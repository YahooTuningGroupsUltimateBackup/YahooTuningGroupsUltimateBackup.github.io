Note also that 227c is equivalent<br/>to 1200-227 = 973c, a 4:7 generator.</p><p>Double chain:                               No. generators in<br/>                        Min        Min      interval<br/>Generator  No. tetrads  7-limit    7-limit  2  4  5  4  5  6<br/>(+-0.5c)   in 10 notes  RMS error  MA err.  3  5  6  7  7  7<br/>-------------------------------------------------------------<br/> 71c           4        12.5c      18.2c    1 -3 -4 -3  0  4<br/>230c           4        11.8c      17.5c    3 -1  4 -1  0 -4<br/>380.5c         4        10.3c      17.5c   -3  1  4  1  0 -4<br/>491c           8        10.9c      17.5c   -1  2 -3  2  0  3<br/>506.5c         4        11.2c      17.5c   -1 -4  3 -4  0 -3<br/>521c           4        16.9c      23.1c   -1  3 -4  3  0  4</p><p>In the table above, I haven&apos;t shown whether the half octave is included in<br/>an interval or not, but that&apos;s not difficult to figure out.</p><p>Note that 230c is equivalent to 970c, an approximate 4:7. 380.5c is a major<br/>third. The last three are fourths that correspond to fifths of 709c, 693.5c<br/>and 679c. The first two of these last three were recognised by Paul Erlich<br/>as being in the vicinity of the 22-tET and 26-tET fifths, and the last one<br/>is not really good enough, with a 23.1c error in its fifths.</p><p>So far, 491c with a half-octave (22-tET) is the winner, with the (recently<br/>discovered?) 317c minor-third a close second, and 125c in third place<br/>(based on treating number-of-tetrads as more important than accuracy).</p><p>I wonder which of these have been discovered before? I wonder if I&apos;ve<br/>missed any? I&apos;m 99% sure I haven&apos;t, but I&apos;ll be rechecking. Any journals<br/>likely to be interested in this?</p><p>Does somone want to work out what ET&apos;s these embed in with sufficient<br/>accuracy? Or how many notes in the largest 125c MOS with 12 notes or less?</p><p>I could look at higher multiple chains with the appropriate fraction of an<br/>octave, if anyone cares. Does anyone want me to change my criteria in any way?</p><p>Regards,<br/>-- Dave Keenan<br/><a href="http://uq.net.au/~zzdkeena">http://uq.net.au/~zzdkeena</a></p></div>
