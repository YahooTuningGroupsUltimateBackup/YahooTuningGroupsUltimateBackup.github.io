He wanted to create a polyphonic instrument with a possibility<br/> to generate any frequency in real time, in a form of steady,<br/> continuously sustained tones, where performer can control dynamics<br/> and timbre even during sounding of tones. It looks somehow his ideal<br/> was harmonic series - he emphasized using of 7, 9, 11, 13 harmonics...<br/> He prophecized an instrument with continuously changing spectre,<br/> mainly on the base of additive harmonic synthesis, but some of his<br/> ideas looks like physical modeling as he wanted such instrument which<br/>can start to sound for example like the flutes, changing to the brass<br/> and the end of sound should be in clarinet timbre... Nice idea - such<br/> morphing is to some degree possible with vector synthesis, or on<br/>phzsical modeling domain in Yamaha VP1.</p><p> Anyway he must have been pretty crazy person:</p><p>- his origin was from Don cossacks</p><p> - he changed his original name to Jewish sounding pseudonym<br/> &quot;Avraamov&quot; (based on Abraham) in Russia, country with high<br/> antisemitism and with all those pogroms (yes, this word is from<br/> Russian language) - but who knows, maybe he had good reason. As<br/> Solzhenitsyn mentioned in Archipelag Gulag, there were many Jews<br/>behind the Soviet October revolution and later in high positions (and<br/> many of them had very bad fate later), and Avramov got after the<br/> revolution some high position of state comissar in some government<br/> culture ministry...</p><p> - he hated Bach, called him the greatest criminal, responsible for<br/> destroying of human hearing</p><p> - he sent an official letter to Soviet government asking to destroy<br/> physically all pianos in Russia</p><p> - he wrote Sirens Symphony, and could get it even performed two times<br/> - in Baku (1922 - to celebrate 5th anniversary of revolution) and<br/> Moscow (one year later). In this work (happening? sound<br/> installation?) he used all sirens in the city factories, marine fleet<br/>in the port, artillery cannons and guns, convoys of truck cars<br/> travelling thru city, etc. There were many conductors using flags and<br/> guns to synchronize whole city. This all few years before Antheil and<br/> Varese with their decent number of sirens in their works... That I<br/> would call &quot;industrial music&quot;!</p><p>Otherwise it&apos;s difficult to get more information about people like<br/> Avraamov, many of them get lost in Gulag after big stalinistic purges<br/> in 30ies, and KGB and Soviet government very carefully erased any<br/> traces and records they left from the books, newspapers, magazines,<br/> libraries ... So even for musicologist in Russia with easier access<br/>to archives and knowledge of language is difficult to dig some piece<br/> of information.</p><p>&gt; &gt; Daniel Forro<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;</p></div><h3><a id=92612 href="#92612">ðŸ”—</a>Daniel Forr&#xF3; &#x3C;dan.for@...&#x3E;</h3><span>9/9/2010 5:12:36 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>There&apos;s a lot of interesting people among the musicians in Russian culture, I must say.
