The whole Sibelius package can be had for about $300<br/>with an educational discount in America and I believe it&apos;s more like<br/>$800 or some such in England, if I&apos;m doing my pounds conversion<br/>correctly.</p><p>I understand they want to make &quot;inroads&quot; into the American market,<br/>one of the reasons they insist on spelling colour, &quot;color&quot; :) and<br/>such like, but it seems unfair to the countrymen of the originators.</p><p>In fact, as I say, I was rather embarassed to mention the American<br/>price on the English chat group...</p><p>best,</p><p>Joseph</p></div>
