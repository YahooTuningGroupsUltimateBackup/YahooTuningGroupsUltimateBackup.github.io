I try to introduce people to it<br/>whether they are a musician or not.</p><p>Usually I find that when I&apos;m explaining it to the uninitiated<br/>musician, describing it in terms of a vibrating string, seems to be<br/>one of the easiest ways to understand &quot;rational tunings&quot;.</p><p>When I&apos;m showing it to someone who might not even understand this<br/>analogy - I get very interesting emotional replies - the music<br/>conjures imagery for them, and I always really enjoy hearing about<br/>the pictures that are created in the mind of folks with no ability to<br/>listen to music outside of an emotional way. There can be something<br/>almost like a personal poetry or fantasy that comes out, when they<br/>here the new sounds - which is commonly very beautiful.</p><p>I took the unprecedented step of giving four rational tunings to an<br/>African American R&amp;B producer, who showed interest in my world fusion<br/>work. I&apos;m still waiting to hear his response.</p><p>I have this dream that one day we will realize that all microtones<br/>are created equal (oh, you know what I mean!), and we will be hearing<br/>this on the radio some day. I wonder if &quot;Puff Daddy&quot; is ready for<br/>this!!!</p><p>Well, now back to my gardening - ah, just wondering what a flowering<br/>Eikosany might look over here!</p><p>Jacky Ligon</p></div>
