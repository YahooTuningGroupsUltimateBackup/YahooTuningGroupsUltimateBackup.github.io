Who would like<br/>to do the work? John, you did a great job on the 22-tET one -- do you<br/>have time to do this one for me? I know Glen Peterson&apos;s real busy<br/>right now.</p><p>Hey Paul,</p><p>If neither John nor Glen (Peterson) work out, you might also want to<br/>consider Glenn Nelson. He&apos;s a very respected Luthier and a real sweet<br/>and honest guy to boot. He has done some microtonal work for me in the<br/>past and I also referred Thadd Comstock to him, and Thadd wound up<br/>commissioning him to build a 7-string 25-aliquot acoustic cutaway the<br/>ground up... Here&apos;s his address (and shop phone number) in case your<br/>interested.</p><p>Glenn Nelson<br/>215 South St<br/>Berlin, MA 01503<br/>508-838-2344</p><p>Dan</p><p>PS - Glenn is also a real monster banjoist, and played electric banjo<br/>in my group PRIVATEWORLD. In fact Glenn played with me on the last gig<br/>I played in &apos;93  -- I &quot;retired&quot; from live performing due to recurring<br/>(and viciously debilitating) migraine headaches and the birth of my<br/>son -- I think the last thing we played was an arrangement of Brecht<br/>and Eisler&apos;s _Song Of The United Front_...</p></div>
