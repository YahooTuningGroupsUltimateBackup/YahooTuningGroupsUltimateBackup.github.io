From where I<br/>&gt;sat it looked like you removed something hanging on a string<br/>&gt;inside the instrument. I meant to ask later what you were<br/>&gt;doing and whether it was the standard practice, etc.</p><p>Hi, Greg,</p><p>I&apos;m glad you found your trip worthwhile and I hope you&apos;re having a<br/>well-deserved rest as well. The gamelan instrument I play in those pieces<br/>you saw -- Slendro Suite and Pelog Partita -- are called gender (pronounced<br/>with a hard &quot;g&quot;), specifically gender barung, a thin-key metallophone with<br/>individual tube resonators. Gender are pentatonic instruments, even though<br/>pelog is a heptatonic system. This means that, in a full gamelan, there are<br/>two pelog gender, one for each of the two common 5-tone subsets of pelog&apos;s<br/>7 tones. However, they differ by just one pitch, which means that it is a<br/>rather expensive redundancy.</p><p>As a result, some instrument makers offer the possibility of &quot;sorogan&quot; or<br/>interchangeable keys. Unlike the other keys, which are suspended from<br/>cords, the sorogan are mounted on styrofoam and held in place with<br/>nail-like posts. While they do not ring as long as the suspended keys, they<br/>can then be easily removed and replaced with other pitches. However, this<br/>means that the resonant frequency of the resonating tube has to change. In<br/>order to do that, I lower a block of wood attached to a string into the<br/>tube. The size of the block is determined precisely so that it changes the<br/>frequency by the desired amount.</p><p>While not that &quot;traditional,&quot; sorogan are certainly not unknown in<br/>conventional gamelan. However, after I saw the possibilities, I asked<br/>Suhirdjan, my instrument maker, not only to allow me to replace pitch 1<br/>with 7 (which is the traditional swap), but also 4 with 5 (which would<br/>never be done in a traditional gamelan). This gives me the possibility of 4<br/>different pentatonics, and I used 3 of them in Pelog Partita -- hence what<br/>Mark Nowitzsky characterized as a &quot;pit stop&quot; between most movements.</p><p>I wrote an article outlining some of this for 1/1. You can find it at<br/><a href="http://www2.hmc.edu/~alves/pleng.html">http://www2.hmc.edu/~alves/pleng.html</a>.

I played<br/>in a gamelan (I mean a real gamelan not a plastic one)<br/>twenty years ago but I&apos;ve not heard this explanation before.</p><p>&gt;Yes, I was thinking of this when I decided to use the<br/>&gt;bowls, but also a piece of Henry Cowell&apos;s -- I think it&apos;s<br/>&gt;his Set of Five that uses them.</p><p>Yes. The mood in your piece is reflective like Cowell. On a<br/>cassette recording of Jalataharangam played by Anayampatti<br/>S. Dhandapani, the playing is quite fast. The interesting<br/>thing is that as the speed increases waves on the surface of<br/>the water modulate the frequency producing a lovely vibrato.<br/>In case you&apos;re interested, the cassette, produced by<br/>Sangeetha, Madras is 6ECDB 7091. When my wife and I go back<br/>to India in November (to visit relatives in Mumbai, and<br/>Madras which seems to be the hub of Carnatic music) I&apos;ll be<br/>looking for a Jalatharangam CD if such exists.</p><p>Greg S</p></div>
