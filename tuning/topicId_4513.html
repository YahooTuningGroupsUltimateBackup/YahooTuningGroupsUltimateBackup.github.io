Another flaw<br/>&gt;in Lucy&apos;s theory is that after enough Lucy fifths (695.493 cents), you will<br/>&gt;get an interval that is closer to a Just fifth, and clearly more consonant<br/>&gt;even though it involves far more steps on the chain of Lucy fifths</p><p>The Pauls seem to be muddling their circular logics, by making the<br/>assumption that integer ratios are the ONLY INTERVALS which can be consonnant.<br/>You are both aiming to judge the validity of my proposal by its<br/>proximity to Just Idiocy thinking.</p><p>Suspend this logic for a moment, and you may begin to understand what I<br/>am attempting to explain.</p><p>1.
