Finnamore wrote:</p><p>&gt; Do you still think I don&apos;t have anything to apologize for? ;-) I&apos;ll<br/>&gt; never post anything on 3 hours of sleep again!</p><p>Hello, there, and I&apos;d like indeed to say that no apologies are called<br/>for in expressing one&apos;s opinions on tuning in this forum, and raising<br/>some very interesting issues and distinctions for further discussion.</p><p>As for posting in the circumstances you describe, while the results<br/>might be a bit unpredictable &lt;grin&gt;, I would hardly say that drawing<br/>an equation between &quot;maximal consonance&quot; and &quot;beatless&quot; that one would<br/>later want to quality is anything meriting an apology.</p><p>In fact, as I see it, maybe part of the issue is to _which intervals_<br/>one might want to apply an ideal of maximal &quot;consonance&quot; or<br/>&quot;beatlessness&quot; in a given tuning system or style.</p><p>Your post is a helpful reminder that these terms may not always be<br/>synonymous (some musicians report finding 400 cents more pleasing for<br/>a major third than 5:4 in styles where this is a prime stable<br/>consonance), but nevertheless I find it easy to treat them as<br/>synonymous in many circumstances.</p><p>Maybe Pythagorean (3-limit just intonation or JI) and 1/4-comma<br/>meantone are classic cases of &quot;consonance maximalization&quot; within a<br/>certain stylistic framework.</p><p>Whatever we may conclude about &quot;sensuousness&quot; or &quot;humanism&quot; in<br/>medieval music (and I agree we should be rather careful to be sure<br/>that such a discussion stays focused mainly on tuning), 3-limit JI<br/>_does_ maximize the beatlessness of certain intervals: obviously the<br/>prime concords of 3:2 and 4:3, and also 9:8 and 16:9. At the same<br/>time, other intervals may become more &quot;beatful&quot; or &quot;tense&quot;:<br/>e.g. 81:64 (vs. 5:4), 243:128 (vs. 15:8), etc.</p><p>In 1/4-comma meantone, it is the major third (5:4) which becomes<br/>ideally beatless -- after all, it&apos;s the prime concord in 16th-century<br/>music -- at a cost of slight &quot;beatfulness&quot; of the fifth (~5.38 cents<br/>narrower than just). This raises an interesting question: is the<br/>choice of 1/4-comma rather than pure 5-limit merely an accommodation<br/>to conventional keyboards and their players, or does the more active<br/>fifth somehow give a &quot;Renaissancy&quot; flavor to keyboard music of this<br/>era which pure 5-limit might not?</p><p>If we define &quot;maximal consonance&quot; in one sense as &quot;beatlessness for<br/>the prime concords in a given system or style,&quot; this leaves open the<br/>possibility either of seeking beatlessless (or least beatful ratios)<br/>for _all_ intervals in a system, or of applying the ideal more<br/>selectively.</p><p>There are various directions we might go in from here, but I wonder if<br/>I would be writing this without the help both of your earlier posts,<br/>and of your &quot;apology.&quot;</p><p>&gt; David</p><p>Most appreciatively,</p><p>Margo Schulter<br/><a href="mailto:mschulter@value.net">mschulter@value.net</a></p></div><h3><a id=3756 href="#3756">ðŸ”—</a>Paul H.

Clearly the syntonic comma is not enough in your opinion. Is the<br/>septimal comma enough? If not, then I would have to disagree that 9:8 and<br/>16:9 are the most consonant tunings for their respective intervals. 8:7 and<br/>7:4 are more consonant if the intervals are played alone and not accompanied<br/>by other notes.</p><p>&gt;In 1/4-comma meantone, it is the major third (5:4) which becomes<br/>&gt;ideally beatless -- after all, it&apos;s the prime concord in 16th-century<br/>&gt;music -- at a cost of slight &quot;beatfulness&quot; of the fifth (~5.38 cents<br/>&gt;narrower than just).</p><p>I think this is an oversimplification. I would say that tuning the major<br/>third, rather than one of the other equally important 5-limit concords,<br/>close to just was common because it leads to a smaller error in the fifth<br/>than tuning the minor third just, and it leads to a smaller error in the<br/>minor third than tuning the fifth just. Using various mathematical criteria,<br/>we recently derived various &quot;optimal&quot; meantone tunings (by considering all<br/>three 5-limit concords), ranging from 5/18-comma to 3/14-comma meantone --<br/>all close enough to 1/4-comma meantone to explain the latter&apos;s historical<br/>position of favor.</p><p>&gt;This raises an interesting question: is the<br/>&gt;choice of 1/4-comma rather than pure 5-limit merely an accommodation<br/>&gt;to conventional keyboards and their players, or does the more active<br/>&gt;fifth somehow give a &quot;Renaissancy&quot; flavor to keyboard music of this<br/>&gt;era which pure 5-limit might not?</p><p>I think the former may have started out as the case, but the keyboard music<br/>created in the Renaissance uses the subtle balances of meantone in such a<br/>way that a non-meantone tuning would destroy the meaning of the music.<br/>Sweelinck&apos;s music, for example, seems particularly to cry out for meantone<br/>(you wouldn&apos;t know this if you hadn&apos;t heard it in meantone).</p></div>
