The standard meantoen<br/>scale uses a minor 7th that sounds larger than what 12-ET uses. The one I<br/>made up has the harmonic-minor 7th. And can play in septimal minor, as well<br/>as e and C. In fact, the split digital 7ths provided made it an all-key<br/>scale.</p><p>The meantone major 3rd is 388 cents. This allows the IV chord to be in the<br/>scale. A nice convenince, but one I&apos;m willing to give up, and be on a<br/>separate scale, to have 5ths worth 700 cents. As the meantone 5th doesn&apos;t<br/>create the strong, harmonically-rich difference and sumational tones the ET<br/>5th does.</p><p>Pauline</p></div>
