In other<br/>words, the greatest errors are at the corners of the<br/>lattice.</p><p>This is not the case for 31-Eq, because its error is<br/>so small for 5/4 and so much greater for 3/2, that<br/>going along the any of the 5-axes does not increase<br/>the error by much, but along any of the 3-axes does.<br/>The error for *all* intervals with 81 [= 3^4] as a<br/>factor is near the maximum of 19 cents.</p><p>In fact it is exactly the opposite of 12-Eq, which<br/>implies the 3/2s much better than the 5/4s.</p><p>[Lumma:]<br/>&gt; 19 and 22 sound more alike than any in the bunch.</p><p>With 19- and 22-Eq the errors are more evenly-distributed,<br/>although also more chaotically, because there are<br/>somewhat significant errors for both 3/2 and 5/4,<br/>7 cents for both ratios in 19-Eq, and 7 and 4 cents<br/>respectively for 22-Eq.  Generally speaking,<br/>viewed on the lattice, there is a dip in the amount<br/>of error which reaches its low point along a diagonal<br/>axis.</p><p>[Lumma:]<br/>&gt; 19 sounds a tiny bit better,<br/>&gt; maybe because of its one just interval.</p><p>With 19-Eq the dip travels diagonally as powers<br/>of 5 increase and powers of 3 decrease, and vice-versa.<br/>Because the amount of error is the same for both<br/>axes, there is an extreme diagonal periodicity in the<br/>implied 5-limit lattice of 19-Eq.</p><p>With 22-Eq the dip travels diagonally exactly the<br/>opposite direction as 19-Eq, as the exponents of<br/>both numbers get larger/smaller.</p><p>As Carl pointed out, for 53-Eq the error is virtually<br/>negligible for the whole implied 5-limit lattice.</p><p>I could have put all this on a diagram . . .</p><p>- Monzo<br/><a href="http://www.ixpres.com/interval/monzo/homepage.html">http://www.ixpres.com/interval/monzo/homepage.html</a><br/>___________________________________________________________________<br/>You don&apos;t need to buy Internet access to use free Internet e-mail.<br/>Get completely free e-mail from Juno at <a href="http://www.juno.com/getjuno.html">http://www.juno.com/getjuno.html</a><br/>or call Juno at (800) 654-JUNO [654-5866]</p></div><h3>Joseph L Monzo &#x3C;monz@xxxx.xxxx&#x3E;</h3><span>3/16/1999 11:02:35 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Two important things I left out of my last<br/>post concerning lattice patterns of ETs:</p><p>1)<br/>The ET degree which falls nearest an approximated<br/>ratio may not necessarily be the one which would<br/>be most likely to be used to represent that ratio.<br/>Issues such as consistency may come into play</p><p>I haven&apos;t looked at it for these scales, but<br/>24-Eq has major inconsistencies.
