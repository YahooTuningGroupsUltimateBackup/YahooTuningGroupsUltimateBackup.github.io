The earliest<br/>prominent proponent of this type of concept was Rameau.</p><p>But I think we&apos;ve established beyond a reasonanble doubt that there is a<br/>second component of sonance. That component is what Sethares calls &quot;sensory<br/>dissonance&quot; and has to do with clashing partials. The earliest prominent<br/>proponent of this type of concept was Helmholtz.</p><p>A correct evaluation of either of these two components should include not<br/>only the played notes but also all the combination tones created in the ear<br/>(as well as other auditory effects such as masking and pitch-shifts).</p><p>Finally, there appears to be an effect which makes chords with a power of<br/>two times the virtual fundamental in the bass part more stable than those<br/>with some other harmonic of the fundamental in the bass part. This may be a<br/>separate component of sonance, or an indication that the harmonic entropy<br/>concept needs to be modified to take this type of octave-equivalence into<br/>account.</p></div>
