You cannot listen to someone else&apos;s collection<br/>&gt;using this technology.</p><p>I reiterate that I neither agree or disagree with the ruling or the legitimacy of <a href="http://mp3.com">mp3.com</a>&apos;s policy. Due to the sensitive nature of the developing set of digital rights in our age, I can only say that it was a less than smart venture on mp3.coms part.</p><p>Best,<br/>Jon</p><p>&grave;&apos;&grave;&apos;&grave;&apos;&grave;&apos;&grave;&apos;&grave;&apos;&grave;&apos;&grave;&apos;&grave;&apos;&grave;&apos;&grave;&apos;&grave;&apos;&grave;&apos;&grave;&apos;&grave;&apos;&grave;&apos;&grave;&apos;&grave;&apos;&grave;&apos;&grave;&apos;&grave;&apos;&grave;&apos;&grave;&apos;&grave;&apos;&grave;&apos;&grave;<br/>Real Life: Orchestral Percussionist<br/>Web Life: &quot;Corporeal Meadows&quot; - about Harry Partch<br/>                         <a href="http://www.corporeal.com/">http://www.corporeal.com/</a></p></div>
