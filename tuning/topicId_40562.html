There is one chord you land on and sit for about 2 seconds or so - right around the 3:44 mark - that I really liked. And I don&apos;t hesitate to say that I find it odd to simply like a chord, but it was a very different kind of resting point and caught my ear. Kudos.</p><p>More than that, I don&apos;t feel comfortable making suggestions about composition. But I thought I would mention this, in case others found it handy...</p><p>Some of the harmonies in the piece were passing by too quickly, so I pulled out the SlowMeDown plugin for Winamp:</p><p><a href="http://www.ronimusic.com/winamp.htm">http://www.ronimusic.com/winamp.htm</a></p><p>For those on the Windows platform using Winamp (and possibly others that accept plugins) for listening to mp3 files, the above plugin allows one to slow down (or speed up) the playback without changing the pitch (alternately - or concurrently - you can alter the pitch as well to tune to your instruments). It is *very* effective if you need to transcribe music, and while pushing the boundaries will make some sound anomalies appear, for most listening it really is quite cool.</p><p>And free, as well.</p><p>They make a stand-alone product that I haven&apos;t tried, with more features and the ability to work with the playback of a CD in the computer (for Macs as well), but that one requires a nominal fee.</p><p>Thanks for the music, Gene...</p><p>Cheers,<br/>Jon</p><p>&grave;&apos;&grave;&apos;&grave;&apos;&grave;&apos;&grave;&apos;&grave;&apos;&grave;&apos;&grave;&apos;&grave;&apos;&grave;&apos;&grave;&apos;&grave;&apos;&grave;&apos;&grave;&apos;&grave;&apos;&grave;&apos;&grave;&apos;&grave;&apos;&grave;&apos;&grave;&apos;&grave;&apos;&grave;&apos;&grave;&apos;&grave;&apos;&grave;&apos;&grave;<br/>Real Life: Orchestral Percussionist<br/>Web Life: &quot;Corporeal Meadows&quot; - about Harry Partch<br/>                         <a href="http://www.corporeal.com/">http://www.corporeal.com/</a><br/>NOTE:<br/>If your reply bounces, try --&gt; <a href="mailto:jonszanto@yahoo.com">jonszanto@yahoo.com</a></p></div><h3>Gene Ward Smith &#x3C;genewardsmith@juno.com&#x3E;</h3><span>11/4/2002 8:57:11 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In tuning@y..., &quot;Jonathan M.
