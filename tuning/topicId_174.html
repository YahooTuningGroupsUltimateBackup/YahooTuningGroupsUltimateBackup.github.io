The one I follow particularly<br/>stresses that aspect of it.</p><p>Sometimes one hears of meditation used to help develop concentration,<br/>and in that approach, breath is used as a meditation object<br/>and aim is to settle ones attention on it to get single pointed<br/>concentration. In that case, one would choose a meditation<br/>object appropriate to one, and indeed other objects are used, could<br/>be e.g. a yellow disk, say, or some colour appropriate to<br/>ones practice. Or something more complicated.</p><p>However, it is possible to meditate without ever trying to<br/>develop concentration on a single object as such. The tradition<br/>I follow works like that.</p><p>That&apos;s why, in this tradition, meditation is really very<br/>much the same as non meditation. Out of meditation, breath<br/>is still there. Only difference in meditation is that you<br/>are sitting still, and there is a kind of awareness instruction<br/>that one is following, but it is incredibly light, almost<br/>nothing to do. As one isn&apos;t even particularly trying to<br/>be aware of the breath, it is much the same as when one<br/>isn&apos;t meditating. It rather works, that occasionally<br/>the breath, coupled with the meditation instruction one<br/>is following, brings one back to the meditation, rather<br/>than the other way round.</p><p>In this tradition one meditates with ones eyes half open,<br/>to keep this connection with the waking world. Things may<br/>happen, dogs barking, traffic, someone may bang on your door<br/>and want you to ask you about something, and that is no<br/>problem as it is all part of the meditation - in the case<br/>where one needs to get up, there&apos;s an instruction to help<br/>one notice the transition from &quot;meditation&quot; to<br/>&quot;non meditation&quot;, and the way one makes distinctions between<br/>the two; rather amusing when one notices it. The instruction<br/>is lighter than one can imagine, so light that it is<br/>inevitable that one will make more of it than is there,<br/>and part of the meditation adventure is noticing that<br/>in all its ramifications - happens not just for beginners<br/>but all the way along the path.</p><p>At later stages people may have visions and amazing<br/>experiences and so forth, and I&apos;m not sure, have a feeling all<br/>that would count as making somewhat more of the<br/>meditation instruction than one really needs to.<br/>(I&apos;ll have to ask my teacher about that).</p><p>However, it is one thing to have been taught how to meditate<br/>and another to explain it to anyone else, and I&apos;m not<br/>qualified to do that.</p><p>The connection one has with whoever gives the instruction<br/>is considered something of value, and an essential part<br/>of the process. One could learn to meditate from a book,<br/>but it perhaps wouldn&apos;t work so well - too easy to<br/>get ones own idea about how it should work, and<br/>then one has none of the necessary feedback to get<br/>one back on track.</p><p>One can talk about it in a general way, as I&apos;m doing a bit<br/>here, but to go into details is another thing.</p><p>My teacher goes into more detail in a booklet, but<br/>doesn&apos;t give &quot;how to&quot; instructions in print.</p><p>You will find meditation instructions in print of course,<br/>so much gets printed, but whether they will be helpful<br/>is another matter, for the reasons explained.</p><p>Anyway, sorry not to be more helpful,...</p><p>I believe there is some inspiration in just hearing<br/>about meditation, even if one doesn&apos;t do it as such,<br/>so perhaps that&apos;s the point in saying all this.</p><p>Have a nice break.</p><p>Robert</p></div><h3>M.
