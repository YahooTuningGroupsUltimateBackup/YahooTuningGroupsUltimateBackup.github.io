For<br/>example, the 22 srutis of the Indian tradition have prompted some<br/>quite different systems on the part of European or other musicians<br/>such as 22-tone equal temperament or intonational schemes involving<br/>septimal ratios.</p><p>Here I would like to describe what I call a &quot;raga-like&quot; scale which<br/>could be called a version of the medieval European Dorian mode, but<br/>using ratios different from those of the Indian srutis based on ratios<br/>of 3 and 5. While I actually use a tempered version of this raga-like<br/>mode, I shall also give near-equivalent just intonation ratios for<br/>this version of medieval European Dorian.</p><p>In describing this scale as &quot;raga-like,&quot; I refer both to the spiritual<br/>qualities I find in the music it invites, and to certain musical<br/>traits reflected in or facilitated by the intonational nuances:</p><p>           (1) The scale is typically used for essentially<br/>               monophonic music with a single melodic line;</p><p>           (2) This melodic line typically flows above a fixed<br/>               drone consisting of the final (or 1/1) and fifth;<br/>               and</p><p>           (3) Certain steps of the scale are tuned so as to<br/>               maximize consonance or &quot;simplicity of ratio&quot;<br/>               in relation to this drone.</p><p>In a tempered realization, the scale is as follows, with note names<br/>showing the layout on a 24-note keyboard with two manuals at<br/>approximately 58.680 cents apart, an interval which serves as the<br/>diatonic semitone of this scale. An asterisk (*) shows a note played<br/>on the upper manual: having the fingers of the right hand move fluidly<br/>between notes on the two manuals, while the left hand maintains the<br/>drone on the lower manual, is part of the performance practice for<br/>this scale.</p><p>    1/1      ~44/39  7/6     ~4/3     ~3/2   ~22/13 ~7/4      2/1<br/>    D4         E4    E*4       G4       A4      B4   B*4       D5<br/>     0       208.19 266.87   495.90   704.10 912.29 970.97    1200<br/>       208.19    58.68   229.03   208.19  208.19 58.68   229.03</p><p>In this tuning, fifths are wide and fourths narrow by about 2.14<br/>cents; the small semitones of this scale, E4-E*4 and B4-B*4, are<br/>narrower than the just septimal ratio of 28:27 (~62.96 cents) by twice<br/>this amount, or about 4.28 cents. Likewise, the major seconds D4-E4<br/>and A4-B4 are wider than a pure 9:8 (~203.91 cents) by about 4.28<br/>cents, or twice the tempering of the fifth.</p><p>Followers of ancient Greek and medieval Arabic or European theory<br/>might note that this scale could be described as a kind of tempered<br/>variation on the diatonic of Archytas (steps of 9:8, 8:7, and 28:27)<br/>with two tetrachords so arranged (28:27 as middle step) as to produce<br/>a medieval European Dorian pattern.[1]</p><p>Let consider first the melodic qualities of this scale, and then the<br/>aspect of vertical consonance above a drone. From a melodic view,<br/>there is an engaging contrast between the narrow semitones and the<br/>spacious septimal whole-tones near 8:7 (E*-G, B*-D); the whole-tones<br/>D4-E4, G4-A4, and A4-B4 are also quite generously sized, being<br/>slightly larger than the Pythagorean 9:8.</p><p>More specifically, the Dorian qualities of the mode are often<br/>communicated in a melody by the major sixth and minor seventh degrees<br/>above the final or 1/1. Here the major sixth is rather wide, with a<br/>size of around 22:13, or somewhat larger than the Pythagorean 27:16<br/>(~905.87 cents), while the narrow minor seventh is very close to a<br/>just 7:4 (actually about 2.14 cents larger). Between these two<br/>important modal degrees is a narrow 58.68-cent semitone, which might<br/>be described as a kind of tempered 28:27 &quot;thirdtone.&quot;</p><p>Since the quality of these sixth and seventh degrees of Dorian is felt<br/>vertically as well as melodically in relation to a drone, this raises<br/>the topic of vertical consonance. A &quot;raga-like&quot; property of this scale<br/>is that many of the notes form highly consonant ratios, or reasonably<br/>close tempered equivalents, in relation to a drone of final and fifth.</p><p>In the above diagram, the scale is shown in the octave D4-D5, and for<br/>this usual range the drone would typically be sounded at D3-A3. Above<br/>this drone, the final D4 (the lowest note of the melodic modal octave)<br/>sounds D3-A3-D4, a tempered 2:3:4, the &quot;threefold perfection of<br/>harmony&quot; in medieval European theory with its 2:1 octave, 2:3 fifth,<br/>and 4:3 fourth.</p><p>The second degree of the mode, E4, sounds a highly favored sonority of<br/>D3-A3-E4, with a tempered ratio of 4:6:9; often medieval or<br/>neo-medieval melodies in Dorian tend to emphasize this degree, for<br/>example by dwelling upon it at internal cadences. While the second<br/>degree is actually about 4.28 cents higher than a pure 9:8 or 9:4, and<br/>closer to 44:39 or 88:39, the consonant impression of 4:6:9 can still<br/>be very effective.</p><p>The third degree, E*4, at a pure 7/6, forms with the tempered fifth of<br/>the drone a sonority of D3-A3-E*4, or approximately 6:9:14, with the<br/>outer interval of a just 7:3 minor third.</p><p>The fourth degree, G4, at a tempered 4/3, forms with the drone a very<br/>pleasing combination of the fourth (or eleventh) and fifth above the<br/>lowest note, or D3-A3-G4, a tempered ratio of 6:9:16. The effect is<br/>similar to that of the common 13th-century European 6:8:9.</p><p>The fifth degree, A4, at a tempered 3/2, yields in relation to the<br/>drone an approximate 2:3:6.</p><p>The sixth degree, B4, at approximately 22/13, yields a somewhat more<br/>complex and active type of sonority than the other steps of the mode:<br/>this could be taken as a tempered 26:39:88, or the fifth of the drone<br/>plus a major sixth rather wider than the Pythagorean 27/16. However,<br/>this rather large major sixth and also the major second or ninth<br/>between the fifth of the drone and this sixth degree are both<br/>intervals with some degree of &quot;compatibility&quot; or &quot;concord,&quot; so that<br/>this degree may also be described as somewhat consonant in effect.</p><p>The seventh degree, B*4, at approximately 7/4, forms with the drone a<br/>tempered 2:3:7, with this degree and the upper note of the drone at a<br/>pure 3:7 septimal minor tenth.</p><p>The eighth degree or octave, D5, at 2/1, forms with the drone a<br/>tempered 2:3:8, an octave extension of the approximate 2:3:4 formed by<br/>the modal final D4 an octave below.</p><p>Thus the first, fifth, and eighth degrees of the mode form tempered<br/>versions of 3-odd-limit concords (2:3:4, 2:3:6, 2:3:8). The third and<br/>seventh degrees form approximate 7-prime-limit or 9-odd-limit<br/>concords, with 7:6 or 7:3 pure (6:9:14, 2:3:7). The second and fourth<br/>degrees form temperd 3-prime-limit or 9-odd-limit concords (4:6:9,<br/>6:9:16) of a &quot;quartal/quintal&quot; kind favored in medieval European and<br/>various other world musical traditions. The sixth degree forms a<br/>rather more complex but still somewhat &quot;compatible&quot; sonority<br/>(approximating 26:39:88) lending a bit of contrast to this general<br/>picture of vertical simplicity.</p><p>Of course, the two dimensions interact in musical practice to give an<br/>overall impression of what I might call stateliness, as when the<br/>seventh degree forming a 2:3:7 or 4:6:7 sonority (the latter if it is<br/>sounded at B*3, the step below the final of the modal octave) resolves<br/>by a majestically large whole-tone step near 8:7 to the final or its<br/>octave (2:3:4 or 2:3:8).</p><p>I find the effect very pleasing for medieval or neo-medieval melodies<br/>in a European kind of style: a very different tradition than that of<br/>India, but yet bringing into play melodic patterns along with elements<br/>of drone and consonance which might somehow seem related.</p><p>One might also take the idea of an already hybrid style yet further by<br/>using this scale for polyphonic music. There are fascinating<br/>resources, including the narrow fourth at a near-21:16 between the<br/>fourth and seventh degrees (4/3 and 7/4), thus making possible the<br/>sonority of 16:21:24:28 (4/3-7/4-2/1-7/3), which is among the most<br/>awesome and beautiful things in music.</p><p>However, the most characteristic use of this scale, and the one which<br/>typifies its &quot;raga-like&quot; characteristics, is the setting of a single<br/>melody above a drone, with the element of vertical consonance.</p><p>In conclusion, I would like warmly to thank Haresh Bakshi for his many<br/>generous contributions to this list, and for his role in promoting<br/>both knowledge and friendship among musicians of many cultures and<br/>traditions.</p><p>-----------<br/>Scala files<br/>-----------</p><p>Here is a Scala file for this tempered scale:</p><p>! ragaldor.scl<br/>!<br/>Raga-like medieval European Dorian mode with ~7/6 and ~7/4, tempered version<br/> 7<br/>!<br/> 208.191213 cents<br/> 7/6<br/> 495.904393 cents<br/> 704.095607 cents<br/> 912.286820 cents<br/> 970.966512 cents<br/> 2/1</p><p>Here is a near-equivalent just intonation tuning:</p><p>! ragaldoj.scl<br/>!<br/>Raga-like medieval European Dorian mode with 7/6 and 7/4, just version<br/> 7<br/>!<br/> 44/39<br/> 7/6<br/> 4/3<br/> 3/2<br/> 22/13<br/> 7/4<br/> 2/1</p><p>----<br/>Note<br/>----</p><p>1.

Thanks once again.</p><p>The Dorian mode can be spoken of as a homologous of the Kafi Thaat:<br/>C D Eb F G A Bb C&apos;</p><p>I am putting aside the distinction between the shruti system and the<br/>tempered scale, for a while; as also the distinction between the Thaat and the raga. This means that you can play the notes of the scale, in a raga-like fashion, and create spiritual, even mystical, ambiance. The result of such an approach is not a raga technically -- it is &quot;mood&quot;, &quot;air&quot;, atmosphere, having a distinctive but intangible quality, having its own attributes and ethos. It is eminently disposed and willing to comply with the dictates of the flights of imagination, whether we are performing singly or severally. It is particularly amenable to nascent improvisations and even the question-answer type &quot;jugalbandhi&quot;. I think this will also lend itself well to flexible harmonization, especially because of the absence of the leading note. The recurring melodic line acts as the motif, the unifying theme or design providing a contrast to the free-flowing<br/>patterns.</p><p>You have referred to the drone. In the case of the Dorian mode, the drone (I mean Tanpura here) would be tuned like G3 C4 C4 C3. This will, of course, vary with the mode we select. For example, the NOTES of the raga Malkaus:<br/>C Eb F Ab Bb will require the drone to be tuned in F3 C4 C4 C3. If, in a mode, both F and G are absent, the drone tuning will have to be<br/>B3 C4 C4 C3. [In the latter case, F# will be present in the mode].</p><p>You also mention: &quot;Certain steps of the scale are tuned so as to<br/>maximize consonance or &apos;simplicity of ratio&apos; in relation to this drone.&quot;  This becomes complicated with the simultaneous sounding of the four strings of the drone (I mean Tanpura), because of too many combinational tones. -- Or, have I got it wrong?</p><p>Like the muurchchhana, the modes keep changing their &quot;Sa&quot;, giving rise to several Indian scales, all of which would make for interesting improvisations. Likewise, the notes of several pentatonic raga-s [Bhupali, Deshkar, Shuddha Kalyan, Durga, Bairagi Bhairav, Gunakri, Bhupal Todi, Bhinna Shadja, Madhu Kaus, Sarang -- the list goes on] can be taken to form the respective scales, and elaborated for sheer joy.</p><p>In conclusion, I want to thank you and all the members of this illustrious group, who have been patient with me, and treated me with excessive indulgence, forgetting and forgiving my gross ignorance of the subject matter of the Tuning group.</p><p>Regards,<br/>Haresh.</p></div><h3>wallyesterpaulrus &#x3C;wallyesterpaulrus@yahoo.com&#x3E; &#x3C;wallyesterpaulrus@yahoo.com&#x3E;</h3><span>2/25/2003 5:28:50 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;Haresh BAKSHI &lt;hareshbakshi@h...&gt;&quot;<br/>&lt;hareshbakshi@h...&gt; wrote:</p><p>&gt; You also mention: &quot;Certain steps of the scale are tuned so as to<br/>&gt; maximize consonance or &apos;simplicity of ratio&apos; in relation to this<br/>&gt;drone.&quot;  This becomes complicated with the simultaneous sounding of<br/>&gt;the four strings of the drone (I mean Tanpura), because of too many<br/>&gt;combinational tones. -- Or, have I got it wrong?</p><p>well, i don&apos;t think one would normally worry about combinational<br/>tones explicitly, because if two notes form a simple ratio, or three<br/>or more notes form an otonal chord, then all the combinational tones<br/>will &quot;line up&quot; and add to the sensation of consonance. also, the vast<br/>majority of combinational tones get louder nonlinearly with the<br/>loudness of the &quot;real&quot; tones, and so only become important at quite<br/>loud volume levels -- not a typical feature of raga as i know it.</p><p>however, there can certainly be competing forces involved in<br/>maximizing the consonance of a note with respect to the various drone<br/>strings. for example, A5 can be tuned low to form a 10/3 ratio above<br/>C4, or tuned high to form a 9/4 ratio above G4. it is my<br/>understanding that one or the other tuning of A may be found in<br/>different ragas, though i&apos;m not sure if the low tuning of A is ever<br/>actually used with a G in the drone . . . haresh?</p><p>but margo was only tuning *certain* notes this way, and as i recall,<br/>left some of the potentially conflicted notes in non-<br/>consonant, &quot;spicy&quot; relationship with the drone . . . margo?</p></div><h3>Haresh BAKSHI &#x3C;hareshbakshi@hotmail.com&#x3E; &#x3C;hareshbakshi@hotmail.com&#x3E;</h3><span>2/26/2003 4:25:03 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;wallyesterpaulrus &lt;wallyesterpaulrus@y...&gt;&quot; &lt;wallyesterpaulrus@y...&gt; wrote:</p><p>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; however, there can certainly be competing forces involved in<br/>maximizing the consonance of a note with respect to the various drone<br/>strings. for example, A5 can be tuned low to form a 10/3 ratio above<br/>C4, or tuned high to form a 9/4 ratio above G4. it is my<br/>understanding that one or the other tuning of A may be found in<br/>different ragas, though i&apos;m not sure if the low tuning of A is ever<br/>actually used with a G in the drone . . . haresh? &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;</p><p>Hello, the tanpura is tuned in either<br/>G3 C4 C4 C3  or<br/>F3 C4 C4 C3  or<br/>B3 C4 C4 C3.</p><p>So, the note A does not take part in the tanpura tuning.
