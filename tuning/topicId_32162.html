If one&apos;s outlook is congruent to some quantity of<br/>&gt; &gt; folks who are convinced that they &quot;have it all summed up&quot;,<br/>&gt; &gt; then it seems likely that those folks within the group of<br/>&gt; &gt; (self-procalimed) &quot;objectivists&quot; would see the detractor&apos;s<br/>&gt; &gt; position as &quot;folly&quot;, and the detractor&apos;s &quot;opinions&quot; as<br/>&gt; &gt; lacking value (as seen through their &quot;objective&quot; eyes).<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; Bob now:<br/>&gt; Why assume that that is what&apos;s going on?</p><p>JG: I was just pondering *your*,impression (above), stating,<br/>&lt;&lt;So opinions have no value if there is an objective reality?&gt;&gt;</p><p>My statement,</p><p>&lt;&lt;If an &quot;objective reality&quot; truly exists,<br/>then (it seems) there is no functional need to<br/>formulate a (lasting) concept of &quot;opinion&quot;.<br/>&quot;Opinions&quot; would become fallacious deviancies.&gt;&gt;</p><p>was a thought about the nature of the *concepts*,<br/>and neither it (or my subsequent statement) were<br/>intended to be taken as value judgements about<br/>your thoughts in general.</p><p>&gt; I make no claims to a<br/>&gt; monopoly on objective knowledge, or even that what knowledge I have<br/>&gt; is all objective.</p><p>JG: Fair enough, my friend.</p><p>&gt; I merely object to the idea that everything is a<br/>&gt; matter of opinion, or that opinions disappear in the light of<br/>&gt; objective knowledge.</p><p>JG: Clearly, they do not (since some claim to have<br/>&quot;objective knowledge&quot; and others have varying &quot;opinions&quot;).</p><p>&gt; Opinions are merely confirmed or invalidated by<br/>&gt; objective knowledge to whatever degree we achieve access to it.</p><p>JG: I would point out that you (appear, to me) to &quot;intonate&quot;<br/>here that you envision an &quot;objective knowledge&quot; which exists<br/>outside of (or at least transcending) human experience. I can<br/>respect that, my friend. My own &quot;take&quot; on this stuff would<br/>lean more towards viewing these &quot;concepts&quot; as of our own<br/>making, without a superceding &quot;objective reality&quot; just<br/>&quot;waiting to be discovered&quot; (as if &quot;knowledge&quot; were a &quot;thing&quot;,<br/>and not an aspect of human conceptualization). That does not<br/>mean that I, on the other hand, as a human being, consider<br/>&quot;all other opinions to be equally (and incontrovertably) valid&quot;.</p><p>&gt; And<br/>&gt; no &quot;objective knowledge&quot; concerning relative existence can ever<br/>&gt; represent &quot;absolute truth&quot;.</p><p>JG: Hear, hear. So why fret about the existence of an<br/>&quot;objective knowledge&quot;, since (if it concerns &quot;relative<br/>existence&quot;), &quot;subjectivity&quot; (once again) rears it head?</p><p>&gt; &gt; &gt; Don&apos;t<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; they exist as attempts to approach reality?<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; JG: Your statement appears to imply (to me) that you are<br/>&gt; &gt; a person who is of the mind that there exists an &quot;objective<br/>&gt; &gt; reality&quot;. Personally, I see the concepts of &quot;objectivity&quot;<br/>&gt; &gt; and &quot;subjectivity&quot; as each being &quot;poles&quot; at the (total)<br/>&gt; &gt; conceptual extremes, both of which have &quot;Achilles heels&quot;.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; A *completely* &quot;subjective&quot; outlook, in ignoring the<br/>&gt; &gt; &quot;applicability&quot; of the rest of the universe, might<br/>&gt; &gt; (literally) &quot;bump into&quot; that which they blissfully<br/>&gt; &gt; have (so far) ignored... An unyielding &quot;brick wall&quot;<br/>&gt; &gt; and is likely to remain such, yielding not to one&apos;s<br/>&gt; &gt; &quot;subjective&quot; belief that it exists not ...<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; A *completely* &quot;objective&quot; outlook, in ignoring the<br/>&gt; &gt; possibility that just because &quot;me and my friends of<br/>&gt; &gt; like mind&quot; *think* they have it &quot;all summed up&quot;,<br/>&gt; &gt; fails to account for the vastness and indifference<br/>&gt; &gt; of Nature to cadres of &quot;like-minded folks&quot; who,<br/>&gt; &gt; in their &quot;mutual assuredness&quot;, may fail to recognize<br/>&gt; &gt; the limits of the applicability of such beliefs.<br/>&gt; &gt; Since the concept of &quot;objectivity&quot; depends upon<br/>&gt; &gt; *agreement* between parties, its fortresses may<br/>&gt; &gt; turn out to be less perennial than imagined ...<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; Bob now:<br/>&gt; This is your definition of &quot;objective reality&quot;; not mine!<br/>&gt; Defining &quot;objective reality&quot; as majority [opinion] would be<br/>&gt; sheer folly.</p><p>JG: But how can you separate a &quot;human conceptualization&quot;<br/>such as &quot;objective reality&quot; from the very humans who invent<br/>and utilize said &quot;conception&quot;. How can we have &quot;knowledge&quot;<br/>which can be said to arise from without (while we perceive<br/>it from within)?</p><p>&gt; Nothing I have said was intended to imply that &quot;objective reality&quot;<br/>&gt; consists of or is in any way dependent upon a prevailing set of<br/>&gt; opinions.</p><p>JG: Again, how can you separate the &quot;known&quot; from the &quot;knower&quot;?</p><p>&gt; I believe that often the prevailing set or opinions is<br/>&gt; totally mistaken, as you rightfully point out as historically self-<br/>&gt; evident. So why are you reading all this extraneous stuff into what<br/>&gt; I<br/>&gt; say? I merely said what I said and not all this extra baggage it<br/>&gt; somehow seems to imply for you.</p><p>JG: It would be hard for me to &quot;know&quot; exactly what you meant<br/>every time unless I *were* you... You are not on trial, and<br/>I assume that I am not, either. We are jabbering about &quot;reality&quot;,<br/>after all. Excessive seriousness just makes one &quot;excessively<br/>serious&quot; ... Not my intentions here in our conversation!</p><p>&gt; &gt; &gt; My experience indicates<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; that many opinions do represent a &quot;fallacious deviance&quot;, but<br/>&gt; that&apos;s<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; part of learning, isn&apos;t it?<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; JG: Once again, your statement appears to imply that you are<br/>&gt; &gt; a person who is of the mind that there exists an &quot;objective<br/>&gt; &gt; reality&quot;. Personally, I see the concepts of &quot;objectivity&quot;<br/>&gt; &gt; and &quot;subjectivity&quot; as each being &quot;poles&quot; at the (total)<br/>&gt; &gt; conceptual extremes, both of which have &quot;Achilles heels&quot;.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; Bob now:<br/>&gt; No, it implies only that, as you yourself have just stated above,<br/>&gt; sometimes opinions don&apos;t work out to be worthwhile, and hopefully &gt;we<br/>&gt; learn enough from that to begin to adjust our opinions to align &gt;more<br/>&gt; fruitfully</p><p>JG: Seems pragmatic...</p><p> with reality.</p><p>JG: The term &quot;reality&quot; brings back to &quot;human conceptualization&quot;,<br/>and (in my opinion) not a &quot;thing&quot; (such as a brick wall<br/>is a &quot;thing&quot;)</p><p>&gt; &gt; Only a (pure) &quot;objectivist&quot; would not rest until others were<br/>&gt; &gt; &quot;persuaded&quot; that their &quot;opinions&quot; represented a &quot;fallacious<br/>&gt; &gt; deviance&quot;. A (pure) &quot;subjectivist&quot; mind find other occupations<br/>&gt; &gt; (such as navel-gazing, according to others) more gratifying.</p><p>&gt; Bob now:<br/>&gt; The existence of an objective reality in no way implies that the<br/>&gt; validity of anyone&apos;s opinions has anything to do with whether they<br/>&gt; are aligned with that of the majority.</p><p>JG: Seems (to me) that that depends a lot on to *whom* one<br/>relies for actualization (whether it be others, or one&apos;s self).<br/>However, the term &quot;objective&quot; deeply (and implicitly) implies -<br/>&quot;true for others as well as true for myself&quot;. So, even if one&apos;s<br/>concepts of &quot;objective reality&quot; were of a totally &quot;subjective&quot;<br/>(personal) origin (if such were possible), the implication of<br/>the term &quot;objective&quot; is that it *applies* (in kind) to others.</p><p>&gt; (By the way, I have practiced<br/>&gt; meditation faithfully every day for over 30 years.)</p><p>JG: Sounds like you find what you do to be meaningful!</p><p>&gt; &gt; &gt; If you are serious in the above statement, it would imply that no<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; opinion could ever be wrong.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; JG: If &quot;no opinion could ever be wrong&quot;, then why would we<br/>&gt; &gt; differentiate between the concepts of &quot;truth&quot; and &quot;opinion&quot;?<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; Bob now:<br/>&gt; Exactly my point! So why did your initial statement so clearly<br/>&gt; imply,<br/>&gt; no, directly state that if an objective reality existed, the very<br/>&gt; concept of opinions would become meaningless?!</p><p>JG: Because it seems valid upon analyzing the meaning and<br/>application of the concepts of &quot;opinions&quot; (as diverse views),<br/>and &quot;objective reality&quot;, which would seem to imply that any<br/>&quot;diversions&quot; from that &quot;reality&quot; would (upon that &quot;reality&quot;<br/>becoming known), appear rather &quot;fruitless&quot;. These are<br/>statements of my thoughts about these linguistic metaphors,<br/>their origin, and their application in human conceptualization.<br/>Not a &quot;raging tirade&quot; which has to be perceived as &quot;right&quot;!</p><p>&gt; &gt; &gt; Everything&apos;s just a matter of equally<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; valuable opinions. Some people do indeed seem to think that<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; everyone&apos;s opinion should have equal weight, but in the sciences<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; and<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; engineering this paradigm fails completely to yield fruitful<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; results.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; JG: From an &quot;engineer&quot; - the &quot;sciences and engineering&quot; provide<br/>&gt; &gt; no assurances of the derivation of &quot;absolute truth&quot;, either,<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Bob now: Agreed!<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; any more than other functional social systems such as religion,<br/>&gt; &gt; astrology, reading tea leaves, etc. All of these &quot;alliances&quot;<br/>&gt; &gt; have shown themselves to fall short of producing &quot;neat and tidy&quot;<br/>&gt; &gt; descriptions/explanations. When Einstein saw what all others<br/>&gt; &gt; had missed, I doubt if those others felt that their sense of<br/>&gt; &gt; &quot;objectivity&quot; had served them well, after all. When we look<br/>&gt; &gt; backwards in time, we can see such failures in retrospect.<br/>&gt; &gt; Let us not forget that a party of &quot;like minded&quot; individuals<br/>&gt; &gt; does not a world make, and that Nature is indifferent to all<br/>&gt; &gt; of our explanations ...<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; Bob now: Agreed!<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; The weight of an engineer&apos;s or scientist&apos;s opinions depends very<br/>&gt; much<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; on how often such opinions have borne fruit in the past.<br/>&gt; Combining<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; glycerine and nitric acid does not produce water, and if in your<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; opinion it does, upon attempting to drink it you will likely not<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; last<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; long enough to discover that your opinion represented a rather<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; catastrophically explosive misjudgment of reality.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; JG: Let us hope that humility accompanies our sense of knowing,<br/>&gt; &gt; lest we put too much faith in either human will or &quot;prevailing<br/>&gt; &gt; opinions&quot;. We call it &quot;reality&quot; after the fact presents itself,<br/>&gt; &gt; but why should we assume that the laws of Nature are static and<br/>&gt; &gt; unchanging (as if those laws existed in service of our concepts)?<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; If it were not for diversity of outlooks, there would be little<br/>&gt; &gt; to say. By the same right, who can &quot;know&quot; that an explanation<br/>&gt; &gt; (which looks backwards in time to a predetermined conclusion)<br/>&gt; &gt; will be applicable tommorrow? A comforting (but dubious) thought.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; Freedom of thought and expression is the best we can do at it.<br/>&gt; &gt; &quot;Objectivity&quot; cannot be shoved down peoples throats, for in<br/>&gt; &gt; order that it remain &quot;persuasion&quot; (and not &quot;coercion&quot;), the<br/>&gt; &gt; free human will (to disagree) on the part of the &quot;audience&quot;<br/>&gt; &gt; must remain. And in the realm of the &quot;aural mind&quot;, what could<br/>&gt; &gt; could be a more fruitful environment for &quot;subjective impression&quot;<br/>&gt; &gt; (and a less fruitfull environment for atomization and dogma)?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Bob now:<br/>&gt; Objective reality, assuming that it exists, would not need anyone<br/>&gt; to<br/>&gt; shove it down anyone&apos;s throat.</p><p>JG: Hear, hear!</p><p>&gt; Don&apos;t drink the potion of<br/>&gt; nitroglycerine I referred to earlier, or you will find (assuming an<br/>&gt; afterlife) that nature does a fine job of shoving reality down all &gt;of<br/>&gt; our throats all the time with no outside help other than our own<br/>&gt; foolishness.<br/>&gt; By the way, I believe the scientific method exists only because the<br/>&gt; noise in our human channels of communication with nature has been<br/>&gt; such that a great deal of redundancy has to be built into our<br/>&gt; inquiries into the realities of natural law in order to overcome<br/>&gt; the<br/>&gt; lousy signal-to-noise ratio (from information theory).</p><p>JG: Nature transcends ditties from Shannon and Nyquist, et al ...</p><p>&gt; I believe<br/>&gt; when<br/>&gt; we truly COMMUNE (rather than merely communicate) with nature, the<br/>&gt; noise in our nervous systems is systematically reduced, and the<br/>&gt; communications redundancy implied by the scientific method becomes<br/>&gt; less and less necessary. Then we see life as it really is (a<br/>&gt; condition traditionally referred to as an enlightened mind).</p><p>JG: Yeah, history is full of &quot;enlightened&quot; genocide in the name<br/>of wisdom.

Men/women of peace are known by their actions.</p><p>&gt; I do not claim to have reached this state, but see it as a state in<br/>&gt; which, as you rightly imply, unity eliminates the need for concepts<br/>&gt; such as subjectivity versus objectivity.</p><p>JG: Well, if you had, you probably would not need to talk<br/>about it ...?

I think we&apos;re actually very much on the same wavelength. When I<br/>say &quot;objective reality&quot;, I&apos;m also referring to the indifference of<br/>nature to off-track opinions and useless concepts. I further agree<br/>that even useful concepts do not represent &quot;Truth&quot; in any absolute<br/>sense.</p><p>No intellectual concept is more than a mental model of reality that<br/>is forever condemned to incompleteness, because no finite concept can<br/>ever fully comprehend the ultimate nature of anything. I believe<br/>holograms represent a profound metaphor for the structure of nature,<br/>where the whole is contained in every part, infinity in every point.<br/>I tend to like the Mahayana Bhuddist idea of a systematically self-<br/>negating cosmology that ultimately ends up saying nothing about that<br/>by knowing which all is known.</p></div>
