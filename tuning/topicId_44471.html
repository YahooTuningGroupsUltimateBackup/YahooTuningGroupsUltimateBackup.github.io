There&apos;s<br/>also a bit near the end with a descending C# - Bb, immediately after a<br/>bunch of Db&apos;s in the previous measure. I think the reason it&apos;s spelled as<br/>C# is to avoid confusion with the D naturals -- C# down to Bb doesn&apos;t make<br/>much sense as a meantone spelling.</p><p><a href="http://www.io.com/~hmiller/midi/neige-qc.mid">http://www.io.com/~hmiller/midi/neige-qc.mid</a></p><p>The respelled notes are pretty obvious from listening to them.
