I want to give &quot;concordance scores&quot; to all the dyads in each EDO, and I want to use Harmonic Entropy to do it since it seems like the best (only?) way to do this for tempered intervals.  However, the values that harmonic entropy gives have a very small range to them, from about 2.5 to about 4.9.  Most of the pitch spectrum comes nowhere near 2.5 (which is the approximate value of a unison), or even near 3.3 (the approximate value of an octave).  So it&apos;s actually kind of hard to tell, just by looking at H.E. values, how concordant an interval is likely to be.  I mean, the difference in h.e. between a 5/4 and a 51-cent quartertone is only about 0.3, but between 5/4 and 2/1 it&apos;s 1.2, which makes it look like a pure 5/4 is only marginally more concordant than a quartertone and not NEARLY as concordant as an octave.  Is there any transformation I could apply to harmonic entropy--or just to a table of harmonic entropy values--that would spit out values that give a clearer picture of concordance?  I.e. that puts 2/1, 3/2, 4/3, 5/4 etc. fairly close together and puts the 51-cent quartertone far away from them?  I have an excel spreadsheet that Carl sent me with Paul&apos;s most recent H.E. values for intervals in 1-cent increments between 1 and 2400 cents.  If there&apos;s an array function I could just paste into it or something, that would be SO AWESOME.</p><p>Thanks!</p><p>-Igs</p></div><h3>Michael &#x3C;djtrancendance@...&#x3E;</h3><span>8/22/2010 7:17:08 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Igs,</p><p>What I&apos;d do the calculate dyadic concordance is<br/>A) Round the dyad to the lowest limit dyad within about +/- 7 cents of it IE<br/>&quot;virtually indistinguishable from it&quot;.

Note that anything under 11/10 or so is going to take a<br/>pretty big hit for critical band dissonance.</p><p>...and, optionally...<br/>D) Subtract or add a few &quot;points&quot; from the dissonance rating based on how the<br/>rounded dyad fits the entropy curve</p><p>   I am thinking the effect of Harmonic Entropy, Tenney height, and related<br/>periodicity can generally be pretty well summarized by odd-limit of the<br/>lowest-limit ratio within about 7 cents of a dyad.<br/>  The problem I see in using harmonic entropy alone is that (as you seem to<br/>indirectly imply as well) some dyads barely register differently on the HE curve<br/>if they aren&apos;t either peaks of minimums in the curve.  20/11 and 11/6 may have<br/>very similar values on the HE curve...but try listening to them and I&apos;m betting<br/>your ear will let you know just how big a difference there can be between two<br/>slightly different &quot;off&quot; notes.</p></div><h3>martinsj013 &#x3C;martinsj@...&#x3E;</h3><span>8/23/2010 4:01:16 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;cityoftheasleep&quot; &lt;igliashon@...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; ... the values that harmonic entropy gives have a very small range to them, from about 2.5 to about 4.9.

Use the curve instead of HE for those very close values and you&apos;ll<br/>find, for example, 10/9 being rated at over 1 1/2 times as dissonant as<br/>5/4...which, at least to me, makes a whole lot more sense.</p><p>   Far as the octave being rated absurdly higher than anything else so far as<br/>consonance...I think it&apos;s a problem with virtually all consonance theories.  To<br/>me anything simpler than 5/4 starts experiencing &quot;diminishing marginal returns&quot;<br/>so far as consonance and by around 4/3 the diminishing value is very strong and<br/>between 3/2 and 2/1 you can&apos;t even really tell a difference so far as<br/>consonance.   Meanwhile most theories seem to show consonance exponentially<br/>rising under 5/4 or so...minus the theory of critical band dissonance.</p><p>   To me, Harmonic Entropy seems to have more value in analyzing near-mid-limit<br/>dyads that are further apart.  But even then it seems to miss things like the<br/>significant audible dissonance difference between 20/11 vs. 11/6 or between 9/7<br/>and 19/15...for example.<br/>  Almost anything above 7-limit seems to get jumbled together under HE as if<br/>your ear can&apos;t tell the difference between any of it.  Which I think is fairly<br/>absurd (IE of course my ear can tell a very significant difference between the<br/>consonance of a 22/15 &apos;diminished&apos; 5th vs. a 40/27 outright wolf fifth).</p></div><h3>Michael &#x3C;djtrancendance@...&#x3E;</h3><span>8/23/2010 1:56:46 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p><a href="http://sonic-arts.org/td/erlich/entropy.htm">http://sonic-arts.org/td/erlich/entropy.htm</a></p><p>This article about Harmonic Entropy states:</p><p>&gt;&quot;It is often possible for the brain to look for periodicities among some<br/>&gt;components of the signal and dismiss the rest as &quot;noise.&quot; This is why the root<br/>&gt;of a major triad does not appear to change when the third is decreased from 5/4<br/>&gt;through 11/9 to 6/5 and the chord becomes a minor triad; although the minor<br/>&gt;triad can be understood as 10:12:15, these numbers are already too high for the<br/>&gt;entropy of the entire signal to be low enough to compete with the low entropy of<br/>&gt;the perfect fifth alone (10:15 = 2:3); even the major third alone (12:15 = 4:5)<br/>&gt;is stronger and can dominate if the &quot;third&quot; is in the bass.&quot;</p><p>   This seems to indicate a key to unlocking triadic harmonic entropy is to give<br/>more weight to the lower limit dyads (at least when it comes to determining<br/>&apos;rootness&apos; &quot;.</p><p>The article also says:<br/>Monzo&gt;&quot;A note relating harmonic entropy to my concept of finity: more complex<br/>ratios tend to be understood as simpler ones.&quot;<br/>   This seems to argue toward my idea of doing analysis of temperament by<br/>rounding them to the lowest limit possible nearby JI ratios within 7 cents or<br/>so.</p><p>Thoughts?</p></div><h3>cityoftheasleep &#x3C;igliashon@...&#x3E;</h3><span>8/23/2010 2:10:37 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Thanks, Steve!  This does the trick quite nicely.  The latter formulation gives scores of 100 to a unison, about 85 to an octave, about and about 50 to a fifth.  The major third is about 30, the minor third is about 26, and the quartertone is at a pretty solid 0.  I think this is a pretty good and useful way to depict concordance.

Despite I am not an<br/>&gt; academically formed musician but a guitarist that years ago was always ready<br/>&gt; to sing a serenade, something must be wrong with me because I disliked all<br/>&gt; those microtonal productions.<br/>&gt; I hope that my opinion is not considered aggressive or a disrespectful<br/>&gt; viewpoint.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Thanks<br/>&gt; Mario<br/>&gt; August 26<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; ----- Original Message -----<br/>&gt; From: &quot;Carl Lumma&quot; &lt;carl@...g&gt;<br/>&gt; To: &lt;<a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>&gt;<br/>&gt; Sent: Monday, August 23, 2010 7:11 PM<br/>&gt; Subject: [tuning] Re: Triadic harmonic entropy and &apos;rootedness&apos;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; Mario Pizarro wrote:<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt; I repeat, this kind of didactic messages is welcomed.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; Hi Mario,<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; Probably the best introduction to what we&apos;re talking about<br/>&gt; &gt; here is to read the work of Paul Erlich:<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; <a href="http://lumma.org/tuning/erlich/">http://lumma.org/tuning/erlich/</a><br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; Especially, in the case of harmonic entropy, this article:<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; <a href="http://lumma.org/tuning/erlich/erlich-tFoT.pdf">http://lumma.org/tuning/erlich/erlich-tFoT.pdf</a><br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; and in the case of everything else, this paper:<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; <a href="http://lumma.org/tuning/erlich/erlich-tFoT.pdf">http://lumma.org/tuning/erlich/erlich-tFoT.pdf</a><br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; Best,<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; -Carl<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; ------------------------------------<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; You can configure your subscription by sending an empty email to one<br/>&gt; &gt; of these addresses (from the address at which you receive the list):<br/>&gt; &gt; <a href="mailto:tuning-subscribe@yahoogroups.com">tuning-subscribe@yahoogroups.com</a> - join the tuning group.<br/>&gt; &gt; <a href="mailto:tuning-unsubscribe@yahoogroups.com">tuning-unsubscribe@yahoogroups.com</a> - leave the group.<br/>&gt; &gt; <a href="mailto:tuning-nomail@yahoogroups.com">tuning-nomail@yahoogroups.com</a> - turn off mail from the group.<br/>&gt; &gt; <a href="mailto:tuning-digest@yahoogroups.com">tuning-digest@yahoogroups.com</a> - set group to send daily digests.<br/>&gt; &gt; <a href="mailto:tuning-normal@yahoogroups.com">tuning-normal@yahoogroups.com</a> - set group to send individual emails.<br/>&gt; &gt; <a href="mailto:tuning-help@yahoogroups.com">tuning-help@yahoogroups.com</a> - receive general help information.<br/>&gt; &gt; Yahoo!
