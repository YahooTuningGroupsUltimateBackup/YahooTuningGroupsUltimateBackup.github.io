Just goes to show you how knowledgable (or is that opinionated?) people on this list are.</p><p>In particular, I wanted to thank Joe Monzo for the dictionary. I have spent quite a few hours trying to &quot;catch up&quot;, and there are quite a few things in the dictionary to be learnt. So, again, Joe, thanks for all your work.</p><p>So, if I may  have seemed to be remiss in my follow-ups, please take this as one huge thanks to everyone...</p><p>Mike</p></div>
