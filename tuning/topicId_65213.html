If we start from 9/8-21/16-3/2-15/8,<br/>then we can move to either 15/14-5/4-3/2-15/8, preserving the 5/4-3/2<br/>interval, or 21/20-21/16-3/2-7/4, preserving the 3/2-7/4 interval. The<br/>first involves a parallel 7/6 interval dropping by 21/20, and the<br/>second a parallel 5/3 interval dropping by 15/14. Then from these<br/>intermediate steps to 1-5/4-3/2-7/4, we have a parallel 7/4 interval<br/>dropping by 15/14 from 15/14-5/4-3/2-15/8, or a parallel 5/4 interval<br/>dropping by 21/20 from 21/20-21/16-3/2-7/4. In no cases are parallel<br/>fifths involved.</p><p>Similar chord progressions can be similarly analyzed. From<br/>35/32-5/4-25/16-15/8, we can move to either 35/32-5/4-35/24-7/4,<br/>dropping a 6/5 interval 25/16-15/8 by 15/14 to 35/24-7/4, or to<br/>15/14-5/4-3/2-15/8, dropping a 10/7 interval 35/32-25/16 to a 7/5<br/>interval 15/14-3/2. The second one progresses to the tonic as before,<br/>and the first has the interval 35/32-35/24, of a fourth, proceed by<br/>contrary motion to 1-3/2.</p><p>&gt; (BTW, the single fact about voice leading that impresses me the most is<br/>&gt; that, in four voices, it&apos;s impossible to follow any of the standard<br/>&gt; rules sets and have two complete 7th chords in a row).</p><p>Why is this a good idea?</p></div><h3><a id=65263 href="#65263">ðŸ”—</a>Yahya Abdal-Aziz &#x3C;yahya@melbpc.org.au&#x3E;</h3><span>3/8/2006 5:07:00 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>On Wed, 08 Mar 2006, Daniel Wolf wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Gene wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &quot;&gt; For example, why should it be limited to the<br/>&gt;  &gt; two-to-four-minute-long song format, or to repertoire that has dropped<br/>&gt;  &gt; out of copyright, or to seven limit harmonies?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; The extension I find most intriguing is to get away from the chain of<br/>&gt; fifths.&quot;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Gene:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I suspect that if you want to achieve this -- progressions that<br/>&gt; reinforce particular harmonic patterns and are robust enough to be<br/>&gt; improvised -- you&apos;re going to have to come up with a structure that<br/>&gt; parallel the tritone-descending-by-semitones (actually alternating<br/>&gt; augmented fourth - diminished fifth-descending-by-semitones) voice<br/>&gt; leading that makes chain of fifths progressions work so well.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; (BTW, the single fact about voice leading that impresses me the most is<br/>&gt; that, in four voices, it&apos;s impossible to follow any of the standard<br/>&gt; rules sets and have two complete 7th chords in a row).<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Does anyone know of any similar voice leading patterns associated with<br/>&gt; chains of other intervals?</p><p>Daniel,</p><p>Of course, one can have a two-voice chromatic<br/>progression in which alternately -</p><p>step 1.  minor thirds expand by semitones to perfect fourths,</p><p>step 2. fourths contract obliquely by one part only moving up<br/>or down by a whole tone.</p><p>eg illustrating both up and downwards motion -</p><p>F F# | E ....

Stacking an extra minor third on top of these<br/>dyads again gives us tritone progressions.</p><p>2. Stacking an extra major third on top of these<br/>dyads gives us progressions of inverted minor<br/>triads.</p><p>3. Stacking an extra perfect fourth on top of<br/>these dyads gives us progressions of inverted<br/>major triads.</p><p>In each of these cases, an appropriate bass<br/>note will of coure harmonise the triad, usually on<br/>the root or fifth.
