It&apos;s 99<br/>steel bars will be mounted and struck in such a way as only the lowest<br/>partial will sound, each bar producing a sine tone.  The scale will be two<br/>normalized octaves of the 8 by 8 matrix.  1/1 = 192 hertz.</p><p>I would like to see a discussion of how the following tuning terms (from<br/>monzo&apos;s online dictionary) would apply to the music derived from such an<br/>instrument.  My basic understanding is that many of the harmonic<br/>interactions would not apply when pure sine tones are involved.  Given this,<br/>how might one go about describing the theory of a music that would be played<br/>on the carillon?</p><p>harmonic entropy<br/>consonance/dissonance<br/>roughness<br/>critical band<br/>harmonic complexity</p></div><h3><a id=4899 href="#4899">ðŸ”—</a>Paul H.

However, if they<br/>are played loud enough, non-linear combination tones (Joe Monzo should add<br/>these to his dictionary -- they include difference tones) will acheive<br/>minumum roughness/beating at small integer ratios. Since the sensitivity of<br/>this effect to fine-tuning is much greater than that of other<br/>consonance/dissonance effects, and the other effects are weak or absent with<br/>sine waves, many people find it easiest to tune very precise JI intervals<br/>with loud sine waves.</p><p>harmonic complexity -- I don&apos;t think Wilson cared much about harmonics</p><p>critical band -- it is what it is</p><p>Additionally:</p><p>studies have shown that subjects perceive a melodic octave with sine waves<br/>to be most in-tune at about 1210 cents in the middle register, and even<br/>wider in the extreme registers.</p><p>&gt;Given this,<br/>&gt;how might one go about describing the theory of a music that would be<br/>played<br/>&gt;on the carillon?</p><p>Most importantly, with sine waves only otonal constructions make sense,<br/>since both combination tones and harmonic entropy are fundamentally otonal<br/>in nature (roughness is normally &quot;partial&quot; to both otonal and utonal chords,<br/>when tones with harmonic partials are involved). Utonal constructions may be<br/>fun compositionally but won&apos;t be maximizing consonance in any way when one<br/>is dealing with sine waves.</p><p>Glen Peterson claimed that when difference tones weren&apos;t being produced, he<br/>found otonal and utonal chords to be equally consonant using sine waves. I<br/>suspect that, given the complex chords he was using (though he hasn&apos;t yet<br/>replied to verify exactly what chords he was using), the central pitch<br/>processor (where harmonic entropy happens) was pretty confused -- remember,<br/>pitch resolution is poor (I would say in the 50 cent ballpark) with sine<br/>waves (experiment: play a familiar melody (just one voice) in several<br/>different tunings using sine waves. Give yourself a blind test if possible.<br/>Can you hear the difference?). So the primary factor in the consonance of<br/>the two chords was the roughness, which was about the same for the two<br/>chords since they had similar spacing.</p><p>In all, if your carillon is truly producing sine waves, I suspect you will<br/>find it rather unmusical, a poor demonstration of JI, and probably rather<br/>annoying to the ear.</p></div><h3><a id=4909 href="#4909">ðŸ”—</a>Darren Burgess &#x3C;dburgess@xxxxxxxxxxxx.xxxx&#x3E;</h3><span>9/18/1999 2:00:06 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Paul and the list,</p><p>Ok, so another way of saying this is that all that fine gradation of pitch<br/>provided by a 49 tone scale is for naught when the pitches are sine tones.</p><p>What do the rest of y&apos;all think?</p><p>Darren<br/>Gainesville, FL</p><p>&gt;<br/>&gt;In all, if your carillon is truly producing sine waves, I suspect you will<br/>&gt;find it rather unmusical, a poor demonstration of JI, and probably rather<br/>&gt;annoying to the ear.<br/>&gt;</p></div><h3><a id=4910 href="#4910">ðŸ”—</a>Kraig Grady &#x3C;kraiggrady@xxxxxxxxx.xxxx&#x3E;</h3><span>9/18/1999 2:17:57 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Play on dear brother.

Sethares&apos; book (a work<br/>of no mean scholarship) is pretty much based on the assumption that the only<br/>reason one would want approximations to just intervals is to reduce<br/>roughness between harmonic overtones. This point of view dates back to<br/>Helmholtz. And yet Pagano, who uses just intervals, sees the harmonic<br/>overtones as un-needed. There could not be two more opposite points of view.<br/>But clearly both men are serious about creating music.</p><p>I have spent years listening to xenharmonic intervals and chords, mostly in<br/>synthesized timbres, and studying the psychoacoustic literature. My best<br/>attempts to understand what I hear in relation to the studies done on<br/>experimental subjects have led me to a certain point of view. But I cannot<br/>remove my own musical background and peculiarities of my auditory system<br/>from the picture. My advice to anyone serious about exploring these issues<br/>is to listen to as many different combinations of timbres and tunings as<br/>possible, and try to listen objectively.</p></div><h3><a id=4968 href="#4968">ðŸ”—</a>patrick pagano &#x3C;ppagano@xxxxxxxxx.xxxx&#x3E;</h3><span>9/20/1999 7:46:31 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>&gt; .

That is why i<br/>was so drawn to the Lambdoma Keyboard as it plays sines AS the pitch and the<br/>reduction to such a simplicity enables a more maneuverable complexity in other<br/>highly ambient domains.<br/>arf she said.<br/>Pagano</p></div><h3><a id=4982 href="#4982">ðŸ”—</a>Joe Monzo &#x3C;monz@xxxx.xxxx&#x3E;</h3><span>9/20/1999 11:39:56 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>&gt;&gt; [Kraig Grady, TD 321.23]<br/>&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt; Actually I think also David Beardsley and Pat Pagano have<br/>&gt;&gt; also used Sines?     over to you fellas!.........<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; [David Beardsley, TD 321.24]<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Yep.
