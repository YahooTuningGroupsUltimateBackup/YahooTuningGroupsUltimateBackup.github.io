First, I would like to thank everyone involved in<br/>this list - you have broken me out of the 12et orbit and I am now exploring<br/>the universe (Its HUGE!!!).  Second, I have a request.  I need help in<br/>analayzing a midi file.  The file was saved on a IBM-PC and can be found at<br/><a href="http://homestead.aol.com/amiltonf">http://homestead.aol.com/amiltonf</a> (It&apos;s the only one there).</p><p>The file is one bar long and only contains two notes.  The two notes start at<br/>the same time at an interval of  2/1 and end with the higher note being bent<br/>to 2/1 above its original start point and the lower note being bent to 3/2<br/>above its start point.  Both are bent using a linear slope.</p><p>After looking at a spectrogram of this file I noticed some extra tones.  Two<br/>possible theories sprang to mind.  1- There&apos;s some kind of phase/filter<br/>effect going on that emphasizes these extra tones, or  2- I have crappy<br/>equipment and Spectrogram is acting strangely because of it.  If someone with<br/>a bit more knowledge would take a look at the file and explain to me where<br/>these extra tones are coming from it would be a big help.</p><p>P.S.  -  I have great plans -- I&apos;ll keep you posted</p></div>
