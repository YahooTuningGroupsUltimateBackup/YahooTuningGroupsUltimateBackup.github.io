A quarter-<br/>&gt; tone is exactly half the size of<br/>&gt; a semitone, an interval which therefore doesn&apos;t exist on the piano &gt; but which can be played<br/>&gt; on all the orchestral<br/>&gt; instruments with practice. Quarter-tones can also be played on &gt; specially adapted<br/>&gt; instruments such as guitars or<br/>&gt; brasses with an added fourth, quarter-tone valve.<br/>&gt; The expanded palette of sounds which becomes available through &gt; microtones is being<br/>&gt; sought more and more by<br/>&gt; composers and as well as quarter-tones, in UK MicroFest 1 you can &gt; hear many other<br/>&gt; possibilities realised by<br/>&gt; performers of exceptional ability.<br/>&gt; Microtonal music is not concerned with any particular style of &gt; music, or any particular<br/>&gt; musical culture.</p><p>A few 12EDO instruments - tuned half a semitone apart - if that&apos;s all the .ac.uk grant chasers are offering - I for one will pass.</p><p>Come on; surprise me (with something new or at least 21st century ?) ;-)</p><p>Been there - done that - flame war invitation.</p><p>Charles Lucy - <a href="mailto:lucy@harmonics.com">lucy@harmonics.com</a><br/>------------  Promoting global harmony through LucyTuning  -------<br/>for information on LucyTuning go to:  <a href="http://www.lucytune.com">http://www.lucytune.com</a><br/>for LucyTuned Lullabies go to <a href="http://www.lullabies.co.uk">http://www.lullabies.co.uk</a><br/>Buy/download/CD from: <a href="http://www.cdbaby.com/cd/lucytuned2">http://www.cdbaby.com/cd/lucytuned2</a></p></div><h3>Joseph Pehrson &#x3C;jpehrson@rcn.com&#x3E;</h3><span>9/17/2005 10:51:07 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, Charles Lucy &lt;lucy@h...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt; A few 12EDO instruments - tuned half a semitone apart - if that&apos;s<br/>all<br/>&gt; the .ac.uk grant chasers are offering - I for one will pass.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Come on; surprise me (with something new or at least 21st<br/>century ?) ;-)<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Been there - done that - flame war invitation.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Charles Lucy - lucy@h...</p><p>***Does anybody actually have the energy or interest to continue a<br/>flame war about QUARTERTONES???  :)</p><p>Actually, for some of my more &quot;conventional&quot; works... i.e.<br/>for &quot;retrograde&quot; players (or &quot;inverted&quot; players, depending), I&apos;m<br/>considering not bucking the trend:</p><p>i.e. using quartertones, but maybe slipping in a few sixth tones and<br/>12th tones...</p><p>Hence, 72 equal!</p><p>J.
