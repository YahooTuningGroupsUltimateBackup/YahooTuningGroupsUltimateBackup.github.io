If it would be mapped to something more dissonant or<br/>complex like &quot;75/64,&quot; which may be heard as &quot;junk&quot; as far as the ear<br/>is concerned, it&apos;s dissonant.<br/>6) #4 holds even in a population of listeners that has never heard<br/>music in non-12 tunings of meantone.</p><p>From this, we can infer that the generalized meantone pattern of<br/>consonances can in some capacity be non-trivially internalized by the<br/>listener. For now it should be known that the full picture of this<br/>process is poorly understood, but from this its existence can be<br/>inferred on a basic level.</p><p>It should be noted that the consonance judgments implicated by these<br/>associations seem to override those implicated by psychoacoustics.<br/>This mechanism can change our perception of the consonance and<br/>dissonance of intervals that are exactly equal in size and harmonic<br/>entropy. It can also cause intervals of low harmonic entropy to sound<br/>much more dissonant than they would otherwise.</p><p>Most significantly, this process happens even if the listener has<br/>never heard a tuning in which the ambiguous intervals differ in real<br/>size. This proves that a listener does not require initial exposure to<br/>a tuning in which the diminished fourth is higher in harmonic entropy<br/>to perceive it as being more dissonant. This shows that the consonance<br/>values of more complex intervals in this map are -inferred- by the<br/>listener, and not -remembered-.</p><p>If the meantone organizational pattern can be internalized by the<br/>listener such that major thirds and diminished fourths differ in<br/>perceived consonance, then this suggests that interval categories<br/>don&apos;t have to be limited to containing only melodic data, but can<br/>contain some form of harmonic data as well. It implies that listeners<br/>of harmonic music form cross-associations and expectations between<br/>melodic and harmonic percepts.</p><p>Any such series of cross-associations between melody and harmony can<br/>be represented by a wedgie of a list of vals. This theory thus<br/>suggests that the wedgie is a representation of an actual, low-level<br/>cognitive procedure that listeners form after continued exposure to<br/>music in a certain tuning system. It implies that the associations<br/>that a regular temperament forms between melody and harmony can be<br/>predicted by the listener to such an intuitive extent so as to impart<br/>&quot;functions&quot; onto the temperament&apos;s structure, and that these functions<br/>can be distinguished even in tunings where intervals in different<br/>categories are tempered together in size. Most generally, it suggests<br/>that the regular mapping paradigm is &quot;very successful&quot; in describing<br/>music cognition, rather than &quot;partially successful.&quot;</p><p>Lastly, it suggests that interval categories are most wholly<br/>represented by a set of coordinates in a projective tempered space.</p><p>From all this we might make a prediction: if intervallic consonance<br/>can be inferred, and if this inference can override the psychoacoustic<br/>consonance of an interval as modeled by harmonic entropy, then a piece<br/>of common practice music should be recognizable, with all of the<br/>consonances remaining ordered in the same way relative to one another,<br/>as long as the melodic structure of the piece can remain intact. It is<br/>further predicted that, as far as the diatonic scale is concerned,<br/>this perception will &quot;break down&quot; only when the size of the generator<br/>actually reaches 3\5 or 5\7, as this will be the point at which the<br/>scale will start to present inconsistent categorical information.</p><p>So we might test this by loading up a piece of common practice music,<br/>perhaps a composition by Schubert, altering the size of the generator,<br/>and seeing what happens.</p><p>-Mike</p></div><h3><a id=101597 href="#101597">ðŸ”—</a>Mike Battaglia &#x3C;battaglia01@...&#x3E;</h3><span>9/8/2011 6:10:32 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>I just had a streaming audio sesh with Gene and Ryan, both of whom<br/>stated that they heard the dim4 as being equal in consonance to an M3,<br/>even with a quite lengthy shredfest in the relevant scales preceding<br/>it, and then ending on the bare dyad in question.
