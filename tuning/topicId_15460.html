I love the sound of the subminor<br/> and<br/>&gt;&gt; subminor 7th chords and it would be great to have these available on<br/>1/1.</p><p>Paul wrote</p><p>&gt;I take it you&apos;re not really asking about CS but asking if it&apos;s<br/>&gt;possible to maintain the 80:81 minimum step size and/or the<br/>&gt;superparticularity of the steps?</p><p>Well I guess so.</p><p>The 65/56  if replaced with 7/6 makes a 49/48 superparticular interval with<br/>the preceeding 8/7 and a 99/98 interval with the following step [33/28].<br/>This interval at 18.5 cents is less than a syntonic comma [81/80, 20.5<br/>cents]</p><p>I tried transposing the 25/21 with the complements of the unison vectors<br/>and found only one that yielded a superparticular interval between scale<br/>steps, 84/99 but the interval it formed was between 7/6 &amp;  99/84 was 99/98<br/>[less than the syntonic comma].</p><p>Justin White</p><p>DAVID JONES LIMITED      ACN 000 074 573</p><p>This email and any attachments are confidential and are intended solely for<br/>the recipient.

I&apos;m sure steps of 99/98 are very common<br/>in those. However, since you said you wantes 30-40 notes per octave, I<br/>figured 41 was already pushing it . . .-Paul</p></div>
