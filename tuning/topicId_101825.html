What you can do is take the first d numbers<br/>where d is the number of primes you&apos;re dealing with.  Then<br/>take d-1 numbers, add a zero to the front, and put them in<br/>the second row.  If it&apos;s a rank 3 temperament, take another<br/>d-2 numbers, but two zeros in front, and you have the third<br/>row.  And so on up to the rank you&apos;re dealing with.  Then<br/>you have a mapping, that may have torsion, but that you can<br/>feed into an optimal tuning algorithm.</p><p>That&apos;ll be on the Xenwiki somewhere, and also here:</p><p><a href="http://x31eq.com/te.pdf">http://x31eq.com/te.pdf</a></p><p>                                   Graham</p></div><h3><a id=101850 href="#101850">ðŸ”—</a>Graham Breed &#x3C;gbreed@...&#x3E;</h3><span>10/21/2011 7:31:05 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>&quot;manuphonic&quot; &lt;manuphonic@...&gt; wrote:</p><p>&gt; What about it, Gene?
