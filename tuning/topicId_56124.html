But<br/>I&apos;m very happy with the piece and what&apos;s a date anyway; surely<br/>nothing in the larger scope of appreciating Ives&apos; unique and timeless<br/>contributions!</p><p>Technically speaking, there&apos;s a lot going on in this piece, but I&apos;d<br/>like to take the time to call attention to one aspect in particular.<br/>Over the Rivers is composed in 11-tone equal temperament. This<br/>tuning, and other tunings like it, are routinely mentioned by<br/>theorists as atonal or discordant tunings with little or no practical<br/>purpose. This is simply not the case,and I intentionally kept this<br/>piece on the threshold of tonality just to accentuate the unique<br/>beauty these &quot;atonal&quot; and &quot;discordant&quot;  tunings can express if one<br/>takes the time to look...</p><p><a href="http://zebox.com/daniel_anthony_stearns/">http://zebox.com/daniel_anthony_stearns/</a></p><p>Thanks,<br/>Dan Stearns</p></div><h3><a id=56125 href="#56125">ðŸ”—</a>Carl Lumma &#x3C;ekin@lumma.org&#x3E;</h3><span>10/13/2004 12:12:43 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>&gt;Hello everybody,<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;Over the Rivers is a piece I wrote as a personal homage to Charles<br/>&gt;Ives for the occasion of the 50th anniversary of his passing.<br/>//<br/>&gt;Technically speaking, there&apos;s a lot going on in this piece,</p><p>I&apos;ll say!
