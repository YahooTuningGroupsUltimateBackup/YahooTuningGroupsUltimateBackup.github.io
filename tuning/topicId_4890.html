This one had been<br/>started many months ago, but for what ever reason had been put off,<br/>terminated, re started, scrunched up in frustration and generally<br/>forgotten. It&apos;s just that sometimes I am at a loss to put into words<br/>exactly what it is that I am hearing. This is a dangerous sound composed<br/>of<br/>low drones, alien and alienating, trance like patterns of sounds, at<br/>times<br/>a continuation of Eno and Fripp&apos;s No Pussyfooting / Evening Star, back<br/>in<br/>those early days of experimental electronic musics, where it appeared<br/>that<br/>in order to create &apos;something&apos;, it appeared to the novice listener (me)<br/>that what was really happening was chaos and destruction of sorts using<br/>sound. In essence DB is just as effective with his tonal worlds as<br/>someone<br/>like Robert Rich, though the main difference is that his world is not as<br/>obvious or &apos;pretty&apos; as that of Rich. At the same time there are elements<br/>of<br/>harmonic chant as well, those long sheets of sound that go right through<br/>you and leave you feeling fantastic . Maybe even a hint of Alan Lamb<br/>with<br/>his outback telegraph poles swaying in the winds, recordings of<br/>incredible<br/>beauty and mystique. DB&apos;s world is a raw one, where the &apos;sound&apos; is<br/>unrecognizable, (processed I assume) till it becomes paradoxically, ugly<br/>and beautiful at the same time. It is precisely this ugly beauty that<br/>captivates me to listen to it for hours on end. How odd. My friends say<br/>they can make me recordings of their refrigerators which sound better<br/>than<br/>this. Cruel, but it must be one mother of a fridge. But it does get back<br/>to<br/>having the patience to sit and listen and be actively involved. DB<br/>strikes<br/>me as being an intelligent person. He is involved with Juxtaposition<br/>Ezine,<br/>regularly gets involved in more than a number of discussion groups on<br/>the<br/>net, knows a lot more about microtonal music than I will ever know in my<br/>time (check out his web site for more info) and from time to time takes<br/>the<br/>Sonic Bloom show on the road, so to speak. This release brings up a<br/>range<br/>of feelings and emotions within me, for what ever reasons, but in terms<br/>of<br/>interesting releases for 1999, it rates with many a great recording I<br/>have<br/>been fortunate enough to have heard.</p><p>Best Wishes</p><p>Hans Stoeve<br/>c/o Power Spot 89.7FM<br/>Sydney, Australia</p><p><a href="http://www.users.bigpond.com/nadabrahma">http://www.users.bigpond.com/nadabrahma</a><br/>reviews / interviews / cd&apos;s for sale / the ultimate Jon Hassell webpage</p><p>subscribe to the Jon Hassell discussion group<br/><a href="http://www.onelist.com/subscribe.cgi/powerspot">http://www.onelist.com/subscribe.cgi/powerspot</a></p><p>We always welcome new material for review and airplay.
