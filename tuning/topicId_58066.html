There was some discussion about &quot;adaptive JI&quot; here a few years back; John deLaubenfels had written a program that retuned MIDI files, which would tune each note as appropriate for the context (relative to adjacent and currently playing notes), and William Sethares&apos; book had some discussion of real-time adaptive tuning. The Tonalsoft web site has an article on adaptive JI (<a href="http://tonalsoft.com/enc/adaptive-ji.htm">http://tonalsoft.com/enc/adaptive-ji.htm</a>), which has some examples of some of the things that have been discussed here in past years.
