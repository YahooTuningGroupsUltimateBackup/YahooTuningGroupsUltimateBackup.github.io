Part 3 now addresses<br/>Rotation 4.</p><p>Again, my warmest thanks to Jacques and Francois and all<br/>participants in the Ethno2 contest for the inspiration they have<br/>lent, and to Ozan Yarman, Shaahin Mohajeri, and George Secor, as<br/>well as now to Jacques Dudon, for the very special knowledge and<br/>wisdom they have shared in the exploration of these and other<br/>modes.</p><p>Here I should also mention a poetic liberty I take below, possibly<br/>less than felicitously, in referring to a tetrachord of 0-162-369-496<br/>cents as a &quot;High Moha/Ishku.&quot; I must confess to sometimes falling into<br/>the imprecise colloquialism of using the name &quot;Moha&quot; (short for<br/>Jacques Dudon&apos;s Mohajira) for just about any tetrachord with a lower<br/>and upper neutral second step and a middle step not too far from 9:8,<br/>or one might say not so close to 8:7 (or larger) that the name Buzurg<br/>or Hijaz would seem more apt, with 48:52:59:64 (0=139-357-498 cents)<br/>as a form of Mohajira (dudon_mohajira_r.scl, Scala archive) showing<br/>that 59:52 at 218.6 cents is within the limits of the Mohajira type.</p><p>My understanding is that &quot;Mohajira&quot; in a proper sense would refer to<br/>such tetrachords where the neutral thirds, unequal or equal, are<br/>somewhere in the &quot;central&quot; range from around 39/32 to 16/13, or about<br/>342-360 cents, with other terms (including possibly Ishku) better for<br/>forms with smaller or larger Zalzalian thirds, such as the tetrachord<br/>resembling that available in Jacques&apos; sumer.scl (Ishku -c) in the<br/>Ethno2 collection at 1/1-79/72-89/72-4/3 (0-161-367-498 cents.</p><p>And now for our itinerary, and the continuation of our journey.</p><p> Rotation 0:  1/1<br/> 0 138.3 207.4 264.8 345.7 472.3 680.9 704.3 842.6 969.1 1050.0 1176.6 2/1</p><p> Rotation 1:  138.3 (~13/12)<br/> 0 69.1  126.6 207.4 334.0 542.6 566.0 704.3 830.9 911.7 1038.3 1061.7 2/1</p><p> Rotation 2:  207.4 (~9/8 or ~44/39)<br/> 0 57.4  138.3 264.8 473.4 496.9 635.2 761.7 842.6 969.1 992.6  1130.9 2/1</p><p> Rotation 3:  264.8 (~7/6)<br/> 0 80.9  207.4 416.0 439.5 577.7 704.3 785.2 911.7 935.2 1073.4 1142.6 2/1</p><p> Rotation 4:  345.7 (~11/9)<br/> 0 126.6 335.2 358.6 496.9 623.4 704.3 830.9 854.3 992.6 1061.7 1119.1 2/1</p><p> Rotation 5:  472.3 (~21/16)<br/> 0 208.6 232.0 370.3 496.9 577.7 704.3 727.7 866.0 935.2 992.6  1073.4 2/1</p><p> Rotation 6:  680.9 (~77/52)<br/> 0 23.4  161.7 288.3 369.1 495.7 519.1 657.4 726.6 784.0 864.8  991.4  2/1</p><p> Rotation 7:  704.3 (~3/2)<br/> 0 138.3 264.8 345.7 472.3 495.7 634.0 703.1 760.5 841.4 968.0  1176.6 2/1</p><p> Rotation 8:  842.6 (~13/8)<br/> 0 126.6 207.4 334.0 357.4 495.7 564.8 622.3 703.1 829.7 1038.3 1061.7 2/1</p><p> Rotation 9:  969.1 (~7/4)<br/> 0 80.9  207.4 230.9 369.1 438.3 495.7 576.6 703.1 911.7 935.2  1073.4 2/1</p><p>Rotation 10: 1050.0 (~11/6)<br/> 0 126.6 150.0 288.3 357.4 414.8 495.7 622.3 830.9 854.3 992.6  1119.1 2/1</p><p>Rotation 11: 1176.6 (~77/39)<br/> 0 23.4  161.7 230.9 288.3 369.1 495.7 704.3 727.7 866.0 992.6  1073.4 2/1</p><p>----------------------------------------<br/>Rotation 4 (11/9): At long last, Buzurg!<br/>----------------------------------------</p><p>0 126.6 335.2 358.6 496.9 623.4 704.3 830.9 854.3 992.6 1061.7 1119.1 2/1</p><p>We now come to the first appearance of a regular Buzurg mode,<br/>along with some alternatives for filling out the upper tetrchord<br/>to accompany the Buzurg pentachord described by Safi al-Din and<br/>Qutb al-Din. We begin with the most symmetrical choice, an upper<br/>Buzurg tetrachord:</p><p>                 Buzurg                   &quot;Buzurg&quot;<br/>     |-----------------------------|--------------------|<br/>     0    127    359   497   623  704   831     1062  1200<br/>    1/1  14/13  16/13  4/3  56/39 3/2  21/13    24/13  2/1<br/>      127     231    138  127    81  127    231     138</p><p>Here I have put quotes around the name of the upper &quot;Buzurg&quot;<br/>tetrachord simply to caution that the idea of a Buzurg<br/>_tetrachord_, as opposed to pentachord, may be a modern concept,<br/>although there is no reason that a medieval theorist might not<br/>have thought in these terms.</p><p>An open question is how the 56/39 step, slightly low here at 623<br/>rather than a just 626 cents, might have been used in a medieval<br/>sayr. Personally I am influenced by the modern Shur Dastgah, and<br/>often treat this step as a lowered version of the fifth that<br/>invites descending motion toward the final, for example:</p><p>      3/2   21/13  56/39  4/3  16/13  4/3  16/13  14/13  1/1<br/>      704    831    623   497   359   497   359    127    0</p><p>or</p><p>      4/3   56/39  4/3  16/13  14/13  1/1<br/>      497    623   497   359    127    0</p><p>Some Buzurg modes of Safi al-Din and Qutb al-Din suggest two<br/>general types of variations for the upper tetrachord which are<br/>supported in this rotation, although the intonational fine<br/>details are sometimes different. The first possibility is what in<br/>modern terms might be called a upper Shur or Arab Bayyati<br/>(Turkish Ushshaq or Arazbar) tetrachord with two neutral second<br/>steps followed by a tone:</p><p>                 Buzurg                Shur or Bayyati<br/>     |-----------------------------|--------------------|<br/>     0    127    359   497   623  704   831    993    1200<br/>    1/1  14/13  16/13  4/3  56/39 3/2  21/13  16/9     2/1<br/>      127     231    138  127    81  127    162    207</p><p>In the medieval Buzurg tunings of this variety, the minor seventh<br/>is at 7/4 (not available in this rotation) rather than 16/9, and<br/>with the upper 8/7 step of 7/4-2/1 further divided into steps of<br/>15:14 and 16:15 (a division of 3/2-13/8-7/4-15/8-2/1).</p><p>While somewhat different from this medieval scheme of Qutb<br/>al-Din, our Buzurg-Shur mode does follow the medieval idea of<br/>seeking &quot;consonance,&quot; that is notes in the upper genus which form<br/>fourths or fifths with those of the lower genus, here Buzurg.<br/>This is only a general guideline, of course, since it is the<br/>breaking of symmetry which produces variety in maqam/dastgah<br/>music, as in modern physics. Here the we have a fifth at<br/>14/13-21/13, and a fourth at 4/3-16/9.</p><p>A second Buzurg mode features almost exactly the intervals<br/>described by Qutb al-Din, the lower Buzurg pentachord being<br/>coupled to this theorist&apos;s tuning for Hijaz, one of the most<br/>common forms used in my music:</p><p>                 Buzurg                    Hijaz<br/>     |-----------------------------|-------------------|<br/>     0    127    359   497   623  704    854    1119  1200<br/>    1/1  14/13  16/13  4/3  56/39 3/2   18/11   21/11  2/1<br/>      127     231    138  127    81  150     265     81</p><p>Qutb al-Din&apos;s Hijaz, a permutation as he notes of the chromatic<br/>genus 22:21-12:11-7:6 (Ptolemy&apos;s Intense Chromatic), has the form<br/>1/1-12/11-14/11-4/3 (0-151-418-498 cents), with steps of<br/>12:11-7:6-22:21 (151-267-81 cents). Here the 7:6 step is narrow<br/>by about 2 cents, while 12/11 and 22/21 are virtually just.</p><p>Here an element of consonance is the fourth 16/13-18/11,<br/>interestingly at a &quot;virtually tempered&quot; 117:88 or 493 cents in<br/>Qutb al-Din&apos;s original JI version (359.5-852.6 cents), where it<br/>is narrow of 4:3 by 352:351 (4.925 cents), and closer to pure in<br/>this irrational temperament where this small comma or kleisma is<br/>dispersed by tempering each fourth narrow by one or two binary<br/>millioctaves (i.e. 1/1024 or 2/1024 octave, 1.172 or 2.344<br/>cents).</p><p>A third Buzurg variation uses a minor seventh step like the<br/>first, but with the higher 18/11 rather than 21/13 neutral sixth,<br/>producing an upper tetrachord like a moderate Arab Huseyni or<br/>Turkish Ushshaq at 0-150-288-496 cents (~1/1-12/11-13/11-4/3),<br/>with consonances of 16/13-18/11 (as in the last variant) and<br/>4/3-16/9 (as in the first). The minor seventh at 992.6 cents<br/>could be taken as either 16/9 (996 cents) or 39/22 (991 cents),<br/>the latter equal to a 3/2 fifth plus a 13/11 minor third at 702<br/>and 289 cents (here a tempered 704 plus 288 cents).</p><p>                                       Arab Huseyni or<br/>                 Buzurg                Turkish Ushshaq<br/>     |-----------------------------|----------------------|<br/>     0    127    359   497   623  704     854    993     1200<br/>    1/1  14/13  16/13  4/3  56/39 3/2    18/11  16/9     2/1<br/>      127     231    138  127    81   150    138     207</p><p>Our Buzurg modes invite what I find to be a pleasant modulation to a septimal form of Rast we shall encounter in our next<br/>rotation, and which I will discuss in connection with that Rast.</p><p>With the simple symmetrical Buzurg having an upper Buzurg<br/>tetrachord, a wonderful cadence is the following, already<br/>presented in Rotation 1 for the Ottoman-flavored Maqam Sikah:</p><p>    831  21/13    704  3/2<br/>    127  14/13     0   1/1<br/>   -138  12/13     0   1/1</p><p>Additionally, the present rotation offers a beautiful flavor of<br/>Turkish Maqam Segah, where the structure is somewhat different<br/>from Arab Sikah, and the intonational shading distinct from<br/>either a typical Arab Sikah, which would prefer larger neutral<br/>steps and intervals above the final; or the most usual modern<br/>form of Turkish Segah, which would prefer smaller steps and<br/>intervals of a 5-limit minor nature (e.g. 16/15, 6/5) rather than<br/>Zalzalian ones.</p><p>As Ozan and his colleagues have shown, measurements of recorded<br/>Turkish performances fit quite well the model of a lower Segah<br/>tetrachord of 1/1-16/15-6/5-4/3 (0-112-316-498 cents), or steps<br/>of 16:15-9:8-10:9 (112-204-182 cents).</p><p>Our gently Zalzalian shade of Segah with a lower tetrachord of<br/>0-127-335-497 cents (~1/1-14/13-17/14-4/3) favors small neutral<br/>or &quot;supraminor&quot; intervals. Applying the seyir or path of melodic<br/>development as described by Ozan in his thesis, we begin with an<br/>ascent exploring this lower Segah tetrachord, and then a disjunct<br/>upper Hijaz tetrachord on the 3/2 step:</p><p>            Segah           tone           Hijaz<br/>    |---------------------|.......|----------------------|<br/>    0    127     335     497     704    831     1119   1200<br/>   1/1  14/13   17/14    4/3     3/2   21/13    21/11   2/1<br/>     127     207     162     207    127     288      81</p><p>As tuned here, the upper Hijaz tetrachord is approximately<br/>1/1-14/13-14/11-4/3 (0-128-418-498 cents), or 14:13-13:11-22:21,<br/>which could be expressed by the arithmetic or string-length<br/>division of 28:26:22:21.</p><p>Having reached the 2/1 step of Segah, we descend by an intriguing<br/>path which at this location of our tuning takes on a septimal<br/>quirk, with the notes shown in ascending order but the motion<br/>actually proceeding mostly downward:</p><p>            Segah          14:13         Mahur       22:21<br/>    |---------------------|......|------------------|.....|<br/>    0    127     335     497    623   831    1062  1119  1200<br/>   1/1  14/13   17/14    4/3   56/39 21/13   24/13 21/11  2/1<br/>     127     207     162    127    207    231    57     81</p><p>While it is routine for disjunct tetrachords to be connected by a<br/>tone of around 9:8, here we have two striking &quot;disjunctions&quot;<br/>bridged by smaller intervals. From the 2/1 we move down by a<br/>usual 22:21 semitone to 21/11 (the ascending leading tone of the<br/>previous Hijaz tetrachord), and arrive at the top note of a<br/>Mahur tetrachord with a form of tone-tone-semitone (like a<br/>European Mixolydian or Ionian mode), a Persian and Turkish name,<br/>with this genus known in the Arab world as &grave;Ajam.</p><p>This tetrachord has steps at 0-207-439-496 cents, or<br/>approximately 1/1-9/8-9/7-4/3, with step sizes at 207-231-57<br/>cents, or ~9:8-8:7-28:27 (204-231-63 cents) -- a septimal<br/>variation on a usual Mahur with two whole tones not far from 9:8,<br/>made yet more striking by the compressed upper step at 57 cents,<br/>considerably smaller than a just 28:27 at 63 cents.</p><p>While Safi al-Din describes a tetrachord of 8:7-9:8-28:27, what<br/>we might call one form of septimal Mahur, I must emphasize that<br/>the use of such an entity in Maqam Segah is a combined quirk of<br/>this tuning set and its author! It is certainly possible to find<br/>other locations in the O3 temperament offering a Maqam Segah with<br/>a usual diatonic Mahur tetrachord for this descending seyir, and<br/>such a Segah will be offered, Inshallah, as a part of &quot;Ethno<br/>Extras.&quot;</p><p>Either this Zalzalzian version of Segah or the more typical<br/>5-limit flavor of modern Turkish practice is intimately related<br/>to a companion form of Maqam Rast, which supplies almost all the<br/>notes needed for the basic ascending and descending seyir we have<br/>just surveyed. Here are the _perdeler_ or notes (Turkish plural<br/>of _perde_, a pitch or note) for our Segah and related Rast, with<br/>Turkish names for these steps, taking the final of this Rast as<br/>perde rast. First, let us consider the notes in the ascending<br/>seyir of Segah:</p><p>                       Segah                     Hijaz<br/>              |-------------------|.....|-----------------------|<br/>    231  138     127    209   162  207    127     288       81<br/>21/26 12/13  1/1   14/13  17/14  4/3  3/2   21/13     21/11    2/1 -369  -138    0     127    335   497  704    831      1119     1200<br/>      sarp                                                     tiz<br/> rast dugah segah  chargah neva hisar evdj gerdaniye (sunbule) segah<br/>  0    231   369    496    704   866  1073   1200     1488     1569<br/> 1/1   8/7  26/21   4/3    3/2  33/20 13/7   2/1      26/11    52/21<br/>    231  138     127    209   162  207    127     288       81<br/>  |------------------|......|-----------------|<br/>             Rast     tone   &quot;High Moha/Ishku&quot;</p><p>All these steps are a regular part of the Rast system except<br/>sunbule at a 21/11 above the final in Segah (the leading tone of<br/>the Hijaz tetrachord pulling up to the 2/1), a step at 1488 cents<br/>above rast, or a near-just 13/11 minor third plus an octave.<br/>While this step is characteristic of Turkish Segah and the<br/>related Sazkar rather than Rast, the Arab Sazkar, regarded as a<br/>member of the Rast rather than Segah (or in Arabic, Sikah)<br/>family, may draw on this Ottoman idiom in its lower tetrachord<br/>with a minor third, neutral third, and fourth above rast. We&apos;ll<br/>encounter a variation on this Arab Sazkar, but with a Turkish<br/>flavor of Rast, in Rotation 11.</p><p>Since Segah, as it name implies, starts on the &quot;third&quot; step of<br/>Rast, perde segah, its 1/1 is the bright 26/21 Zalzalian third of<br/>Rast, with an opening small neutral step of about 14/13 leading<br/>to Chargah, the 4/3 of Rast. The higher perde segah is placed in<br/>relation to perde rast, or the wider the rast-segah third, the<br/>smaller a step from segah to chargah (here 26/21-4/3 or 14:13),<br/>and likewise a third from segah to neva (here 26/21-3/2, or in JI<br/>63:52 at 332 cents, and in this temperament a slighter wider 335<br/>cents closer to 40:33 at 333 cents or 17:14 at 336 cents).</p><p>In much modern Turkish practice, with perde segah yet higher and<br/>at or only slightly below 5/4, we get a segah-chargah step of<br/>about 16:15 (5/4-4/3) and a segah-neva third around 6:5<br/>(5/4-3/2). This creates the interesting situation where a &quot;high<br/>segah&quot; (i.e. the perde or step, in relation to Rast) produces<br/>what might be called a &quot;low Segah&quot; (i.e. the smaller sizes of the<br/>steps and intervals in Maqam Segah with respect to perde segah).</p><p>Because of the septimal flavor of the lower Rast tetrachord, the<br/>second or dugah step at 8/7 is called &quot;sarp dugah&quot; in Ozan<br/>Yarman&apos;s naming system, distinguishing it from the usual variety<br/>around 9/8. Otherwise, apart from the sunbule of the upper Hijaz tetrachord, the notes of the upward Segah seyir are shared with<br/>the Rast system -- but in a combination that suggests a variant<br/>on Rast not so often recognized.</p><p>To complete the lower Segah tetrachord, which starts with perde<br/>segah at 26/21 above rast, with a 4/3, we need a large neutral<br/>sixth at around 33/30 or 104/63 above rast, called perde hisar. To start the next tetrachord of Segah at 3/2, we need a large<br/>neutral seventh at around 13/7 above rast, perde evdj.

As we shall see, the step avoilable at 728<br/>cents (a near-just 32/21) makes it possible to realize a permutation<br/>of one of his octave tunings -- and one fitting with an Ottoman<br/>flavor!</p><p>A good point of departure for our exploration is a Turkish flavor of<br/>Zalzal&apos;s tuning, which consists of two conjunct Rast tetrachords plus<br/>an upper tone at 9/8 -- or here slightly larger because of the<br/>temperament with its extended fifths -- to complete the octave.</p><p>            Rast                     Rast             tone<br/>    |----------------------|-----------------------|.........|<br/>   rast   dugah   segah chargah  neva   hisar    ajem     gerdaniye<br/>   0.0    208.6   370.3  496.9  704.3   866.0    992.6     1200.0<br/> ~ 1/1    44/39   26/21   4/3    3/2    33/20    39/22      2/1<br/>       209     162     127    207    162      127      207</p><p>Here, in keeping with the Turkish flavor of intonation, the steps are<br/>given their Turkish names. Each of the conjunct Rast tetrachords has a<br/>tone near 9:8 (here, at a rounded 207 or 209 cents, actually closer to<br/>44:39), plus a large neutral second at 162 cents (about three cents<br/>narrow of 11/10) and a small one at 127 cents (less than two cents<br/>narrow of 14/13).</p><p>This flavor of Rast at 209-162-127 cents is quite close to a<br/>tetrachord of Safi al-Din: 1/1-9/8-99/80-4/3 or 9:8-11:10-320:297<br/>(204-165-129 cents). His 320:297 might be described as a &quot;virtually<br/>tempered&quot; 14:13 enlarged by the small interval of 2080:2079 (0.833<br/>cents) so as to achieve a pure 4:3 fourth. The neutral third at 99/80<br/>or 369 cents differs by this same minute factor from the simpler 26/21<br/>at not quite a cent larger. Although Dr. Fazli Arslan gives no<br/>indication that Safi al-Din associated this tetrachord with Rast, it<br/>nicely fits a style of historical Turkish Rast where, as Ozan Yarman<br/>has noted (Tuning list #90061), the interval between the steps rast<br/>(the final) and segah (its third) is &quot;at 370 cents or so.&quot;</p><p>The basic character of the Rast family is established by the lower<br/>tetrachord, known in Arab theory as the &quot;root&quot; tetrachord. This lower<br/>tetrachord may be paired with an upper Rast tetrachord (conjunct or<br/>disjunct), and also with certain other forms of upper tetrachords, to<br/>make up the different recognized members of the Rast family of<br/>maqamat in Turkish or Arab theory and practice.</p><p>Here the conjuct upper Rast tetrachord brings into play the steps or<br/>perdeler (Turkish plural of _perde_, &quot;pitch&quot;) hisar at a large neutral<br/>sixth above rast, here 866 cents, and ajem at a minor seventh, here<br/>993 cents (tempered a bit narrow of the standard 16/9 at 996 cents).<br/>This variety of Rast is thus often known in Turkish theory as an<br/>&quot;Acemli Rast,&quot; since it uses perde acem at the minor seventh.</p><p>In the Arab world, this same form is known as Nairuz Rast or Nirz<br/>Rast, possibly by association with a medieval form of tetrachord noted<br/>by the Lebanese scholar Nidaa Abou Mrad called Nawruz with a larger<br/>and smaller neutral second followed by a whole tone. In modern terms,<br/>this would correspond with the tetrachord of Maqam Huseyni, here found<br/>on perde neva, the 3/2 step, here at 162-127-207 cents. This upper<br/>Huseyni tetrachord offers an alternative focus which we may explore in<br/>improvisations.</p><p>              Rast                   Rast             tone<br/>    |----------------------|-----------------------|.........|<br/>   rast    dugah  segah chargah  neva    hisar   ajem    gerdaniye<br/>    0      208.6  370.3  496.9  704.3    866.0   992.6    1200.0<br/> ~ 1/1    44/39   26/21   4/3     3/2    33/20   39/22      2/1<br/>       209     162     127    207    162      127      207<br/>                                   |-------------------------|<br/>                                        Huseyni (Nawruz)</p><p>In this standard form of Acemli or Nairuz Rast, the position of the<br/>steps corresponding to a Pythagorean tuning is taken as more or less<br/>stable: dugah (9/8), chargah (4/3), neva (3/2), and ajem (16/9) -- in<br/>Arabic, dukah, jahargah, nawa, and &grave;ajam. It is the steps at the third<br/>and sixth, segah (Arabic sikah) and hisar, that are subject to many<br/>shadings of taste and local custom in the Arab world and Turkey<br/>alike.</p><p>Thus in al-Farabi&apos;s version of Zalzal&apos;s tuning, a classic example of<br/>this form of Rast (not yet so named in any known source), segah and<br/>hisar are at 27/22 and 18/11, or 355 and 853 cents. In Safi al-Din and<br/>they are placed at a complex Pythagorean 8192/6561 and 32768/19683, or<br/>384 and 882 cents, only a schisma of 32805/32768 (1.954 cents)<br/>narrower than a just 5/4 and 5/3, a variety of Rast also described by<br/>Qutb al-Din al-Shirazi (c. 1300), and adopted in 20th-century Turkish<br/>theory as the norm.</p><p>The tuning of segah and hisar at 370 and 866 cents -- respectively<br/>approximationg 26/21 or 99/80 and 104/63 or 33/20 -- represents a<br/>shading higher than that followed in much of the Arab world, but at<br/>the same time distinctly lower than the 5-limit or quasi-5-limit<br/>flavor of Safi al-Din, Qutb al-Din, and much modern Turkish practice.</p><p>While our tuning nicely represents the historical Turkish flavor of<br/>Rast described by Ozan with segah at around 26/21, in certain parts of<br/>the Arab world such as Syria, as well as in Turkey, one encounters a<br/>tuning at around 16/13 (359 cents) or the slightly higher 16 commas<br/>(e.g. 16/53 octave in 53-EDO) at 362 cents. This shading might be<br/>considered in Arab terms a &quot;bright&quot; Rast; but by Turkish standards, as<br/>Ozan notes, 16/13 or 16 commas represents a &quot;low segah,&quot; with 26/21<br/>representing more of an &quot;upper range&quot; -- still lower, of course, than<br/>the 5-limit or quasi-5-limit interpretation also popular in Turkey.</p><p>All of these Turkish and Arab tunings are shadings of the same basic<br/>structure which has been attested for more than a millennium: two<br/>conjunct Rast tetrachords plus an upper tone.</p><p>To move from this Acemli or Nairuz Rast to two other standard modern<br/>forms of Rast, we would need a step not present in this rotation: a<br/>regular major sixth, the classic 27/16 (906 cents) of medieval theory,<br/>realized in our temperament at a somewhat wider 911 or 912 cents, very<br/>close to a just 22/13.</p><p>In place of 22/13, we have a step at 935 cents, about two cents wide<br/>of a just 12/7, or septimal major sixth. We also have available a<br/>septimal major second at 232 cents, less than a cent wide of 8/7. Using these septimal steps, we can construct a variation on the most<br/>typical modern form of Rast with _disjunct_ Rast tetrachords joined by<br/>a middle tone:</p><p>              Rast              tone              Rast<br/>    |-------------------------|.......|------------------------|<br/>             sarp                            sarp<br/>   rast      dugah   segah chargah   neva   huseyni   evdj  gerdaniye<br/>    0        232.0   370.3  496.9   704.3    935.2   1073.4  1200.0<br/> ~ 1/1        8/7    26/21   4/3     3/2     12/7     13/7     2/1<br/>       232       138      127    207     231      138      127</p><p>This septimal version of Rast closely approximates 1/1-8/7-26/21-4/3<br/>or 8:7-13:12-14:13 at 0-231-370-498 cents (231-139-128 cents), a<br/>tetrachord using the same melodic steps as a tuning of Safi al-Din<br/>where the smaller 14:13 step precedes the larger 13:12, thus<br/>1/1-8/7-16/13-4/3 or 8:7-14:13-13:12 (0-231-359-498 cents or<br/>231-128-139 cents).</p><p>More generally, in a disjunct Rast, the kind often assumed in modern<br/>Turkish or Arab theory if the name of the maqam is mentioned without<br/>qualification, we have in the upper tetrachord a major sixth step<br/>huseyni (or here its septimal variation) and a neutral seventh step<br/>evdj (in Arabic, awj). The steps at septimal versions of a tone (8/7)<br/>and major sixth (12/7) are, following a suggestion of Ozan Yarman,<br/>termed sarp dugah and sarp huseyni to show that they are higher by a<br/>septimal comma (in JI, 64:63 or 27.264 cents), here a tempered<br/>difference of about 23 cents.</p><p>The neutral seventh step evdj at some 1073 cents, or a tempered 13/7<br/>(1072 cents), very effectively pulls up to the final or its octave by<br/>a step of 127 cents.</p><p>As mentioned in the previous discussion of Rotation 4 (Part 3), the<br/>Buzurg modality found in that rotation invites a pleasant modulation<br/>to the Rast found in this, and more specifically to the disjunct<br/>septimal Rast we are now considering. Another version of the previous<br/>diagram will show the nexus between these modal systems:</p><p>                    Rast              tone              Rast<br/>           |-----------------------|..........|------------------------|<br/>                  sarp                              sarp<br/>   arak   rast    dugah   segah chargah      neva  huseyni   evdj  gerdaniye<br/>       127     232     138    127      207       231      138    127<br/> -126.6   0.0     232.0   370.3  496.9      704.3   935.2   1073.4  1200.0<br/>~ 13/14   1/1      8/7    26/21   4/3        3/2    12/7     13/7     2/1<br/>             Buzurg              tone            Buzurg<br/>    |-----------------------|......!.....|---------------------|<br/>                  sarp                               sarp<br/>   arak   rast    dugah   segah chargah hijaz neva  huseyni   evdj<br/>   0.0   126.6    358.6   496.9  623.4 704.3 830.9  1061.7   1200.0<br/>~  1/1   14/13    16/13    4/3   56/39  3/2  21/13   24/13     2/1</p><p>From this perspective, taking Rast (the premier maqam) as a point of<br/>reference, our Buzurg mode starts on the step 127 cents below perde<br/>rast, or an octave below perde evdj or a 13/7 with respect to rast, a<br/>step known in Turkish theory as arak, and in Arabic as &grave;iraq. It will<br/>be seen that a Buzurg mode with two disjunct Buzurg tetrachords (here<br/>at a tempered 1/1-14/13-16/13=4/3) shares almost all of its pitches<br/>with our septimal Rast, the exception being perde hijaz at a 3/2 (here<br/>tempered at 704 cents) above Buzurg&apos;s final of arak and a small<br/>tritone of 578 cents or around 88/63 above perde rast.</p><p>A delightful bridge or pivotal note connecting Buzurg with Rast is<br/>perde chargah, not a note of either Buzurg tetrachord but rather the<br/>extra note of the lower pentachord at 623 cents (~56/39 or 63/44)<br/>which divides the middle tone (segah-hijaz) between these tetrachords<br/>into a small neutral second (segah-chargah) plus a form of semitone or<br/>limma (chargah-hijaz), here at 127-81 cents, and in the corresponding<br/>medieval JI version at 14:13-117:112 or 128-76 cents. As I noted in<br/>the discussion of Buzurg (Part 3, Rotation 4), perde chargah might be<br/>used in the manner of a Persian _moteqayyer_ or variation on the 3/2<br/>fifth apt, for example, as the top note of a phrase descending toward<br/>the final.</p><p>To use this note as a bridge to Rast -- or, in the yet more evocative<br/>expression of a modern Arab teacher reported by Scott Marcus, as &quot;the<br/>door&quot; or _al-bab_ providing a modulatory passage to the new maqam --<br/>we might begin at segah (the 4/3 of Buzurg), ascend to chargah, and<br/>from there descend back through segah as if on the way to arak, but<br/>then instead shift the focus to perde rast as the 1/1, with chargah<br/>now serving as the 4/3 of a septimal Rast tetrachord above this new<br/>final. This shift in the role of perde chargah from the &quot;extra&quot; 56/39<br/>or 63/44 step of Buzurg to the 4/3 of Rast, the note providing the<br/>fourth of the all-important lower or &quot;root&quot; tetrachord, is pleasant<br/>indeed.</p><p>A third form of Rast which in Turkish theory is sometimes known (like<br/>our first form with conjunct Rast tetrachords) as Acemli Rast, and in<br/>the Arab world by the name of Suzdular. The latter name is a variation<br/>on Suz-i Dilara, understood in a fuller Arab or Turkish appreciation<br/>to be in fact a _tarqib_ or &quot;composite&quot; mixing elements of various<br/>simple maqamat, with the simpler Arab concept of &quot;Suzdular&quot; evidently<br/>referring to one combination of tetrachords that may arise in the<br/>course of Suz-i Dilara:</p><p>              Rast              tone            Buselik<br/>    |-------------------------|.......|------------------------|<br/>             sarp                            sarp<br/>   rast      dugah   segah chargah   neva   huseyni  ajem   gerdaniye<br/>   0.0       232.0   370.3  496.9   704.3    935.2  992.6    1200.0<br/> ~ 1/1        8/7    26/21   4/3     3/2     12/7   39/22      2/1<br/>       232       138      127    207     231      57       207<br/>                              |-----------------------|<br/>                                        Mahur</p><p>In modern Turkish and Arab practice alike, where the most common form<br/>of ascending Rast is the previous type with two disjunct Rast<br/>tetrachords featuring a major sixth and neutral seventh, this general<br/>type with a major sixth and minor seventh is a characteristic<br/>descending form. The upper tetrachord thus presents us with a new type<br/>of interval not present in either the conjunct or disjunct form: a<br/>semitone between the major sixth (perde huseyni) and minor seventh<br/>(perde ajem), in contrast to the tones and neutral seconds that<br/>otherwise prevail. In our septimal flavor, this melodic nuance is<br/>accentuated by the narrowness of the semitone (sarp huseyni-ajem) at<br/>only 57 cents, which might represent an inaccurate 28/27 (the classic<br/>septimal thirdtone of Archytas) or an accurate 91/88 (the difference,<br/>for example, between 12/7 and 39/22, the latter narrower than 16/9 by<br/>a small comma or kleisma of 352:351).</p><p>The upper tetrachord above the 3/2 step at 0-231-288-496 cents or<br/>231-57-207 cents, approximately 1/1-8/7-13/11-4/3 (8:7-91:88-44:39),<br/>is quite close to a permutation of a Greek tuning, the Diatonic of<br/>Archytas at 1/1-8/7-32/27-4/3 (0-231-294-498 cents) or 8:7-28:27-9:8<br/>(231-63-204 cents). In my experience, this tetrachord coupled to the<br/>lower Rast tetrachord with its kindred septimal flavor serves as<br/>delightful mode of Rast in its own right as well as nicely<br/>complementing the most common modern ascending form with a neutral<br/>seventh.</p><p>In modern Ottoman terms, this tetrachord may be seen as a septimal<br/>variant on Buselik, whose basic pattern is tone-semitone-tone, with<br/>the minor third often around a Pythagorean 32/27 or 294 cents, but<br/>possibly rather narrower, with a septimal flavor around 7/6 (267<br/>cents) possible. Our regular 288-cent minor third, near 13/11 (289<br/>cents), fits this concept. While the Arab term Nahawand might also<br/>fit, the corresponding Turkish name Nihavend would suggest, at least<br/>in theory, a larger minor third typically around 6/5 (316 cents).</p><p>This flavor of Acemli Rast offers another tetrachord with a septimal<br/>flavor inviting exploration in improvisations: the tetrachord on the<br/>4/3 step at 0-207-438-496 cents, or 207-231-57 cents. This is a close<br/>to another permutation of the Archytas Diatonic appearing in Safi<br/>al-Din, but with the first two steps in reverse order: 1/1-8/7-9/7-4/3<br/>(0-231-435-498 cents), or 8:7-9:8-28:27 (231-204-63 cents). Here the<br/>regular tone at 207 cents, close to 9:8, comes first, and then the<br/>septimal tone at 231 cents (a virtually just 8:7), and finally the<br/>small 28:27 semitone narrowed in this temperament from 63 to 57 cents.</p><p>This general type of tetrachord with tone-tone-semitone is known in<br/>Arab and Persian theory alike as Mahur, and in Arab theory often as<br/>&grave;Ajam.</p><p>So far, we have encountered three common forms of Rast sharing in<br/>common their lowest tetrachord, but varying in their upper tetrachords<br/>(3/2-2/1). We might summarize the situation as follows:</p><p>     Acemli (Nairuz) Rast:      neva      hisar    acem      gerdaniye<br/>                                704.3     866.0    992.6      1200.0<br/>                                      162      127        207</p><p>                                            (sarp)<br/>     Disjunct Rast:             neva        huseyni   evdj   gerdaniye<br/>                                704.3        935.2   1073.4   1200.0<br/>                                        231       138     127</p><p>                                            (sarp)<br/>     Acemli Rast:               neva        huseyni acem     gerdaniye<br/>     (Arab Suzdular)            704.3        935.2  992.6     1200.0<br/>                                        231       57      207</p><p>The variable steps are the sixth, neutral or major (hisar/huseyni);<br/>and the seventh, minor or neutral (ajem/evdj). In addition to the<br/>above standard forms of Rast with neutral sixth and minor seventh,<br/>major sixth and neutral seventh, or major sixth and minor seventh,<br/>there is a fourth possibility highlighted by Jacques Dudon: the<br/>combination of neutral sixth and neutral sixth, or hisar-evdj:</p><p>              Rast              tone          Ishku (?)<br/>    |-------------------------|.......|------------------------|<br/>   rast     dugah   segah chargah   neva    hisar     evdj  gerdaniye<br/>   0.0      208.6   370.3  496.9   704.3    866.0    1073.4  1200.0<br/> ~ 1/1      44/39   26/21   4/3     3/2     33/20     13/7     2/1<br/>       207       162     127    207      162      207      127</p><p>Here I have permitted the second step of the lower tetrachord, dugah,<br/>to revert back to its usual position at around 9/8 or 44/39, although<br/>there is no reason why one could not sarp dugah at 8/7 as well. Our<br/>attention is focused especially on the upper tetrachord with its<br/>bright neutral sixth and neutral seventh above the final. This<br/>tetrachord has intervals of 0-161.7-369.1-495.7 cents, with steps of<br/>161.7-207.4-126.6 cents. A fairly close JI equivalent would be another<br/>permutation of Safi al-Din&apos;s &quot;Medium conjunct&quot; tetrachord, yielding<br/>1/1-11/10-99/80-4/3 (0-165.0-368.9-498.0 cents), with steps of<br/>11:10-9:8-320:297 (165.0-203.9-129.1 cents).</p><p>In the most loose and generic terms, the upper tetrachord might be<br/>called &quot;Moha,&quot; short for Dudon&apos;s Mohajira, a pattern with lower<br/>neutral second, tone, and upper neutral second. However, in his<br/>concept of Mohajira proper, the neutral third step is generally<br/>somewhere between 39/32 (342 cents) and 16/13 (359 cents), with the<br/>bright Ottoman flavor here at 369 cents (26/21) clearly out of this<br/>range.</p><p>One possibly more apt term is Ishku, Dudon&apos;s JI sequence with<br/>differential coherence (-c) which makes available a tetrachord of<br/>1/1-79/72-89/72-4/3 (0-160.6-367.0-498.0), or 79:72-89:79-96:89<br/>(160.6-206.3-131.1 cents). See Dudon&apos;s sumer.scl (2-Middle East<br/>folder) in his Ethno2 collection. Since our upper tetrachord above is<br/>very similar, the name Ishku may be an auspicious choice.</p><p>The mode as a whole we might term Rast-Ishku by analogy with a Scala<br/>archive file named rast_moha.scl for a tuning by Jacques Dudon with a<br/>lower Rast and an upper Mohajira tetrachord.</p><p>Having surveyed four varieties of Rast, we might briefly consider a<br/>few polyphonic cadences. Our conjunct or Nairuz Rast with a usual<br/>dugah near 9/8 and a minor seventh step (perde ajem) offers a stately<br/>three-voice cadence identical to a favorite formula of 13th-century<br/>Europe, the only difference being the tempered rather than Pythagorean<br/>intonation resulting from the gently extended fifths and narrowed<br/>fourths.  Each voice moves by a regular tone of around 9:8 so that a<br/>minor sixth expands to an octave and a minor third to a fifth, thus<br/>arriving at a complete 2:3:4 sonority.</p><p> 993  39/22   1200  2/1<br/> 497   4/3     704  3/2<br/> 209  44/39     0   1/1</p><p>Here the minor third at sixth at 288 and 784 cents are close to just<br/>ratios of 13/11 and 11/7 (289 and 782 cents), by comparison to the<br/>Pythagorean 32/27 and 128/81 at 294 and 792 cents. It is curious that<br/>a maqam in a flavor of intonation recalling a tetrachord of Safi<br/>al-Din should invite a polyphonic cadence favored in Europe during the<br/>same century.</p><p>In our other form of Acemli Rast with septimal major second and major<br/>sixth steps at around 8/7 (sarp dugah) and 12/7 (sarp dugah), the same<br/>cadence takes on a special color, and if possible has a yet statelier<br/>effect, because of the raised position of dugah at a comma higher,<br/>thus making the minor third and sixth above it a comma narrower, at<br/>around 264.8 and 760.5 cents, close to 7/6 and 14/9 (267 and 765<br/>cents).</p><p> 993 39/22   1200  2/1<br/> 497  4/3     704  3/2<br/> 232  8/7      0   1/1</p><p>In addition to the vertical septimal color, the wide 8:7 whole-tone<br/>step in the lowest voice may lend this progression an especially<br/>spacious and stately quality.</p><p>With our septimal flavor of disjunct Rast, the high position of dugah<br/>at around 8/7 makes possible the use of an especially engaging<br/>Zalzalian sonority in near-just form: 8:12:13 (0-702.0-840.5 cents),<br/>here tempered at 0-703.1-841.4 cents.</p><p> 1073  13/7   1200  2/1<br/>  935  12/7    704  3/2<br/>  232   8/7     0   1/1</p><p>Harmonically, while the 13:12 neutral second between the upper voices<br/>contributes some notable tension, the outer 13:8 neutral sixth has a<br/>rather &quot;bright&quot; color, an effect which George Secor attributes to the<br/>nature of this interval as the 13th harmonic of the fundamental. While<br/>the two lower voices descend by wide 8:7 steps, the upper voice<br/>ascends by the small Zalzalian second at around 14:13 so typical of<br/>this flavor of Rast. This progression illustrates how Zalzalian<br/>polyphony may arrive at charming results quite different from anything<br/>in the known practice of medieval Europe.</p><p>For our Rast-Ishku variation with dugah in its regular position around<br/>9/8, or here closer to 44/39, we have available this characteristic<br/>cadence:</p><p> 1073  13/7    1200  2/1<br/>  497   4/3     704  3/2<br/>  209  44/39     0   1/1</p><p>While the lower minor third around 13/11 expands to a fifth, the outer<br/>large neutral sixth at around 865 cents, near 28/17 (864 cents) or<br/>33/20 (867 cents), expands to the octave with the lower voice<br/>descending by a tone and the highest ascending by 127 cents. A special<br/>color is lent by the tritone between the two upper voices, about 577<br/>cents (close 39/22 at 574 cents or 88/63 at 579 cents). The effect may<br/>somewhat recall a cadence in Europe around 1200 with a minor third<br/>expanding to a fifth and a major sixth to an octave, with the upper<br/>tritone adding color and tension, but at the same time is unique.</p><p>Since this last cadence does not directly involve the sixth degree of<br/>Rast, it may be found not only in our Rast-Ishku with a neutral sixth<br/>step (hisar), but also in the kind of usual disjunct Rast not<br/>available in this rotation with a regular major sixth step (huseyni),<br/>where it is equally characteristic and effective. The steps involved<br/>in the cadence, dugah-chargah-evdj for the first sonority resolving to<br/>rast-neva-gerdaniye, are the same in both these forms of Rast.</p><p>Before leaving this rotation, we should note a mode of Safi al-Din<br/>placing two of his septimal tetrachords at 1/1-8/7-16/13-4/3 or<br/>8:7-14:13-13:12 in a _conjunct_ arrangement, here as in our disjunct<br/>septimal Rast with the order of the two neutral seconds reversed so as<br/>to produce a higher neutral third step at around 26/21 (370 cents)<br/>rather than 16/13 (359 cents):</p><p>               Rast                     Rast             tone<br/>    |-------------------------|------------------------|,,,,,,,,|<br/>             sarp                     sarp<br/>   rast      dugah   segah chargah    neva   hisar  ajem     gerdaniye<br/>   0.0       232.0   370.3  496.9    727.7   866.0  992.6     1200.0<br/> ~ 1/1        8/7    26/21   4/3     32/21   33/20  39/22       2/1<br/>        232      138      127    231      138     127      207</p><p>Melodically, this is a delightful mode, with polyphony somewhat more<br/>delicate because of the imperfect fifth above the final. However,<br/>medieval Near Eastern and European theory suggest one solution: the<br/>generous use of fourths, much favored in the simple polyphonic<br/>practice around the 9th-11th centuries of what was known to theorists<br/>such as Ibn Sina as _tarqib_ (a &quot;composite&quot; or &quot;mixture&quot; of<br/>simultaneous voices), and Europeans such Guido d&apos;Arezzo as _diaphonia_<br/>(&quot;singing apart&quot;) or _organum_ (an &quot;organized&quot; mixture of voices).<br/>It is interesting that both Ibn SIna and Guido, contemporaries making<br/>their monumental contributions in the early 11th century, both prefer<br/>the fourth as an especially pleasing concord.</p><p>In describing how three voices may sing in parallel, Guido likewise<br/>prefers a sonority which could serve as a close above the final,<br/>3:4:6, with a lower 4:3 fourth and an upper 3:2 fifth.</p><p>A two-voice texture moving mostly in parallel fourths, judiciously<br/>mixed with fifths as one moves about the mode, would nicely complement<br/>the conjunct tetrachordal structure, with an option for sometimes<br/>adding a third voice at the octave. Such an approach seems in line<br/>with the medieval theory of _tarqib_, a term now more familiar in its<br/>meaning of a &quot;composite&quot; maqam formed as a mixture of simpler maqamat,<br/>rather than a mixture of simultaneous pitches. Traditional practices<br/>favoring polyphony in fourths, as on the kemence or fiddle in Turkish<br/>folk music of the Black Sea region, and also the Pontic lyre, also<br/>provide precedents for such a technique.</p><p>Finally, we should quickly mention that a form of Maqam Penchgah is<br/>also available in this rotation, but with some complications resulting<br/>from the lack of a regular as opposed to septimal major sixth. Making<br/>fullest use of this maqam involves an artful alternation between the<br/>two positions of dugah at around 9/8 or 8/7, a nicety likely better<br/>understood after an introduction to the regular Penchgah, which occurs<br/>in the coming Rotation 9.</p><p>For now, it may suffice to show the septimal form of this Penchgah,<br/>much like our disjunct septimal Rast but the 4/3 step replaced by a<br/>step at 577.7 cents or around 88/63:</p><p>                   Penchgah                       Rast<br/>    |---------------------------------|------------------------|<br/>             sarp                            sarp<br/>   rast      dugah   segah    hijaz  neva   huseyni   evdj  gerdaniye<br/>   0.0       232.0   370.3    577.7 704.3    935.2   1073.4  1200.0<br/> ~ 1/1        8/7    26/21    88/63  3/2     12/7     13/7     2/1<br/>        232      138       207     127    231      138      127</p><p>To explain why a regular version of perde dugan at around 9/8 (or here<br/>44/39) plays an important role also, let us consider this delightful<br/>Penchgah cadence for three-voice polyphony:</p><p>   1073  13/7    1200 2/1<br/>    578  88/63    704 3/2<br/>    209  44/39     0  1/1</p><p>Here a large neutral third at 369 cents or around 26/21 expands to a<br/>fifth, while a large neutral sixth at 865 cents between 28/17 and<br/>33/20 expands to an octave, with the lower voice descending by a tone<br/>while both upper voices ascend by approximate 14/13 steps. Placing<br/>dugah at its regular position around 44/39 permits the neutral third<br/>and sixth to have their full size, with a bright and &quot;expansive&quot;<br/>effect so typical of polyphony in Maqam Penchgah, and recalling the<br/>premier final cadence of 14th-century Europe where a major third and<br/>sixth expand to fifth and octave, the lower voice descending by a tone<br/>and the upper voices ascending together semitonally.</p><p>This is not to say that a version with dugah at 8/7 would be &quot;wrong,&quot;<br/>but rather that this form should serve as as option supplementing the<br/>above flavor so summing up the flavor of polyphony in Maqam Penchgah:</p><p>   1073  13/7    1200 2/1<br/>    578  88/63    704 3/2<br/>    232   8/7      0  1/1</p><p>Here the neutral third and sixth at 346 cents and 841 cents<br/>(around 11:9 and 13:8), each a comma smaller than in the previous<br/>example, offer a pleasant flavor of their own. Happily, as we shall<br/>see, Rotation 9 also has available both versions of this cadence.</p><p>Most appreciatively,</p><p>Margo Schulter<br/>mschulter@...</p></div><h3><a id=92941 href="#92941">ðŸ”—</a>Margo Schulter &#x3C;mschulter@...&#x3E;</h3><span>9/17/2010 6:34:36 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>----------------------------------<br/>               Ethno Extras: Zalzalian 12 set<br/>                     Part 5: Rotation 6<br/>             ----------------------------------</p><p>[To preserve formatting as much as possible, please try the Use<br/>Fixed Font Width option if viewing on the Yahoo site.]</p><p>Hello, all.</p><p>To provide a convenient &quot;itinerary&quot; for the Zalzalian 12 set, so that<br/>people can keep track of where we&apos;ve been and where we&apos;re going, I&apos;ll<br/>place at the beginning of each part a summary of the rotations adapted<br/>from Scala output.

As I remarked in discussing an instance of<br/>this 162-207-127 cent flavor of tetrachord in the previous article in<br/>this series (Part 4, Rotation 5), while the structure with lower and<br/>upper neutral seconds and a middle tone around 9:8 might suggest<br/>Jacques Dudon&apos;s Mohajira or &quot;Moha&quot; for short, the use of a neutral<br/>third step larger than 16/13, and here specifically around 26/21,<br/>suggests the name Ishku, a differentially coherent (-c) JI series used<br/>in his sumer.scl in the Ethno2 collection.</p><p>If this charming mode is used as the basis of polyphony, then the<br/>structure of conjunct tetrachords invites a style leaning to parallel<br/>fourths, sometimes mixed at fifths at locations where they are<br/>available.</p><p>It should briefly be noted that while the above version with two<br/>conjunct tetrachords and an upper tone is the complete maqam as<br/>specified by Qutb al-Din, Safi al-Din includes an additional step<br/>subdividing the upper tone. Owen Wright places it at 40/21, thus<br/>dividing this tone into a lower 15:14 (119 cents) and an upper 21:20<br/>(85 cents), a division later used, for example, in Kraig Grady&apos;s<br/>renowned Centaur &quot;7-cap&quot; tuning. Dr. Arslan, in a Pythagorean<br/>interpretation, places it at a 180-cent diminished third above the<br/>16/9 step, or a Pythagorean comma below the octave. Neither variety of<br/>extra step is available here.</p><p>Another kind of conjunct tetrachordal structure invited by this<br/>rotation is a variation the modern Turkish Huseyni, which as described<br/>both by Sulphi Ezgi in 1933 and by Ozan Yarman should have a lower<br/>step around 11/10 or 165 cents, Ezgi&apos;s 1/1-11/10-32/27-4/3<br/>(0-165-294-498 cents), or 11:10-320:297-9:8 (165-129-204 cents), as<br/>mentioned in the previous article, being a permutation of Safi<br/>al-Din&apos;s 1/1-9/8-99/80-4/3 (0-204-369-498 cents) or 9:8-11:10-320:297.</p><p>Our temperament closely approaches Ezgi&apos;s tuning of Huseyni, which in<br/>its usual form uses two disjunct rather than conjunct Huseyni<br/>tetrachords:</p><p>             Huseyni                    Huseyni            tone<br/>   |-------------------------|--------------------------|........|<br/>  0.0    161.7   288.3     495.7    657.4    784.0   991.4    1200.0<br/>  1/1    56/51   13/11      4/3     117/80   11/7    44/39     2/1<br/>      K        S        T        K         S      T         T<br/>     162      127      207      162       127    207       209</p><p>Experience has shown me that this mode is most pleasant not only<br/>melodically but polyphonically, often negotiating the lower tetrachord<br/>in parallel fourths and the upper in parallel fifths, speaking in<br/>terms of the position of the lower voice in a two-voice texture. This<br/>approach may evoke the technique of playing in parallel fourths on a<br/>rebab, which I recall hearing, for example, in a recording of a<br/>performance in Afghanistan, or likewise on the kemence.</p><p>As it happens, this mode, while it was suggested to me by the Huseyni<br/>tetrachord of modern Turkish music, matches a maqam of Safi al-Din<br/>with two conjunct tetrachords of a type called Nawruz likewise with a<br/>pattern, using the above modern Turkish sign,s of K-S-T (in a<br/>Pythagorean interpretation, 180-114-204 cents), and likewise named<br/>Maqam Nawruz. By any name, it is a worthy maqam.</p><p>So far, we have considered modes featuring two identical tetrachords<br/>arranged conjunctly. Safi al-Din&apos;s maqam called Rahawi -- a name with<br/>a range of uses and interpretations in his writings and others! -- as<br/>interpreted by Dr. Arslan involves a conjunct union of a lower<br/>medieval &grave;Iraq tetrachord and an upper medieval Nawruz:</p><p>            &grave;Iraq                       Mawruz             tone<br/>   |-------------------------|--------------------------|........|<br/>  0.0    161.7    369.1    495.7    657.4    784.8    991.4    1200.0<br/>  1/1    56/51    26/21     4/3     117/80   11/7     44/39     2/1<br/>      K        T         S       K         S       T         T<br/>     162      207       127     162       127     207       209</p><p>Here the contrast between the bright 26/21 neutral third of the lower<br/>tetrachord and the minor sixth of the upper Nawruz adds a pleasing<br/>element.</p><p>Improvising in this medieval Nairuz, one option I find attractive is<br/>sometimes using a minor rather than neutral third in the lower<br/>tetrachord, thus transforming it from &grave;Iraq to Nawruz, and modulating<br/>to a medieval Maqam Nawruz (or in modern terms a &quot;conjunct Huseyni&quot;).<br/>Another, as realized in this rotation, would be sometimes to raise the<br/>second step of the upper tetrachord from 657 to 727 cents, thus<br/>transforming the genus from Nawruz to that what modern theory would<br/>call a form of Buselik at 0-230.9-288.3.495.7 cents or 231-57-207<br/>cents -- or, in Safi al-Din&apos;s terms, Nawa.</p><p>            &grave;Iraq                 Buselik (Nawa)           tone<br/>   |-------------------------|--------------------------|........|<br/>  0.0    161.7    369.1    495.7     726.6   784.8    991.4    1200.0<br/>  1/1    56/51    26/21     4/3      32/21   11/7     44/39     2/1<br/>      162      207      127     231        57     207       209</p><p>While the 727-cent step would not form a stable vertical fifth above<br/>the final -- the fourth instead serving this function in polyphony --<br/>I find that it nicely serves melodically as kind of substitute for 3/2<br/>in this upper Buselik tetrachord, which in the course of a seyir<br/>nicely complements the usual Nawruz form.</p><p>Another modulation I am drawn to in Maqam Rahawi, after ascending in<br/>my medieval Nawruz or modern &quot;conjunct Huseyni&quot; flavor, curiously<br/>seems to me a septimal variation on a _disjunct_ &grave;Iraq-Nawruz<br/>structure, but with a difference!

This is much<br/>like the 12:13:14:16 version of Ibn Sina&apos;s famous tetrachord, viewed<br/>by some as his own original version, which I often term &quot;Shur&quot; because<br/>of its aptness for that Persian dastgah or modal family -- but with<br/>the upper 8:7 tone foreshortened by a comma to 9:8 (or here a<br/>virtually just 44:39), and the tetrachord itself from 4:3 to 21:16,<br/>thus 0-138-265-473 cents or 1/1-13/12-7/6-21/16!</p><p>What I should confess is that originally I found this modulation in a<br/>tuning system with a 3/2 step available where the corresponding<br/>tetrachord was something like 132-154-209 cents or 0-132-286-495<br/>cents, another possible sharing of Shur, or perhaps of a popular<br/>Lebanese flavor of the Arab Maqam Bayyati, where Amine Beyhom reports<br/>a taste for a lower step around 130 cents. However, I find a disjunct<br/>upper tetrachord here on the 32/21 step at 0-138-127-209 steps a happy<br/>choice also.</p><p>Given Jacques Dudon&apos;s boldness in embracing 21/16 fourths and 32/21<br/>fifths, as in his famous article on septimal gamelan tunings where he<br/>speaks of the Surakarta (S) style in its characteristic tuning of using &quot;a wonderful 32:21&quot; above the &quot;tonic,&quot; in a scale that &quot;dances<br/>with the wolves.&quot;</p><p>While the vertical concord of these wide fifths in gamelan music<br/>brings into play the matter of timbre, Dudon&apos;s observation that a<br/>viable tonic or final need not have &quot;a 3:2 perfect fifth&quot; holds also<br/>for maqam and dastgah music, where modern as well as medieval modes<br/>without a 3/2 step are well known. Further, Syrian theorists favoring<br/>the Turkish system of 53 commas sometimes describe for certain maqamat<br/>steps at 21 commas (475 cents) or 32 commas (725 cents) above the<br/>final, close to 21/16 and 32/21 at 471 and 729 cents.

See Dudon&apos;s sumer.scl (2-Middle East<br/>&gt; folder) in his Ethno2 collection. Since our upper tetrachord above is<br/>&gt; very similar, the name Ishku may be an auspicious choice.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; The mode as a whole we might term Rast-Ishku by analogy with a Scala<br/>&gt; archive file named rast_moha.scl for a tuning by Jacques Dudon with a<br/>&gt; lower Rast and an upper Mohajira tetrachord.</p><p>Dear Margo,<br/>Before I get deeper in the lecture of your last wonderful posts, just<br/>a quick comment on what is &quot;Ishku&quot; in my sense - also because<br/>sumer.scl, described as a &quot;Rast scale using Ishku -c variations&quot;, was<br/>not very explicit about it ! So now I try to do better :<br/>Ishku is a recurrent sequence (and also a rhythm and a fractal<br/>waveform), based on an -c algorithm that can be generalised that way :<br/>In a triad C : D : E, if you have E - D = C/8 (in frequencies), C :<br/>D : E start a Ishku sequence. Next note will be &quot;F sori&quot; (half-sharp<br/>F) and so on, where each new tone will unvariably tend toward<br/>184.36788 c., that is a slightly large 10/9.<br/>The simplest Ishku series I know, and part of it is in this<br/>sumer.scl,  is :<br/>(64) 72 80 89 99 ... (80 - 72 = 8,  89 - 80 = 9,  99 - 89 = 10 ...<br/>and next numbers will jump 3 octaves up, to 881 and 980)</p><p>Seen like this, a Ishku series has not much relation with Rast or<br/>Mohajira. But when we look closer, we see they have.<br/>We can explain it from the solution of Ishku&apos;s recurrent sequence,<br/>8x^2 - 8x = 1,  or (sqrt of 6 + 2) /4 = 1.112372436,<br/>because it is also the arithmetical mean between the semififth (sqrt<br/>of 6 / 2) and 1/1, that means Ishku tones and  semififths are always<br/>differentially coherent.<br/>For example in the neutral triad 40 : 49 : 60 that we find in<br/>sumer.scl between D and A,<br/>40 + 49 = 89 = E<br/>and 89 - 80 = 49 - 40 = C.<br/>By co&iuml;ncidence, but harmony is based on those, three Ishku tones are<br/>very close to 11/8 (we verify it in the series above in the ratio<br/>between 72 and 99).<br/>11/8 or similar have two occurences in Rast, same in Mohajira, it&apos;s<br/>another possible bridge with Ishku.<br/>Then the fact that Ishku^3  ~11/8, because of other coherences and<br/>natural reasons suggests musical Ishku-based pentachords, ending with<br/>a fifth,<br/>such as 72 : 80 : 89 : 99 : 108<br/>Here we find that 99 - 72 = 27 and 108 - 99 = 9 (pure 3/2 fifths),<br/>but the Ishku fractal value can also suggest -c corresponding fifths<br/>of 703.592 and 708.4936 c... that I know you may not dislike !<br/>In conclusion, in absence of 80 (or 88, since 88 - 79 = 9 is also of<br/>a Ishku kind) the sumer.scl subset 72 : 79 : 89 : 96 will only be an<br/>uncomplete example of a Ishku tetrachord, nevertheless with 96 - 89 =<br/>79 - 72 = 7  it has some other qualities that need to be explored.</p><p>What comes to my mind about this tetrachord is that it could also be<br/>generated by an &quot;Iph&quot; series (that&apos;s how I call a generator of 2/<br/>Phi), since 144 the octave of 72 is precisely the following Fibonacci<br/>after 89, and 144/89 ~1,618, same thing with your original 21 : 26<br/>(Fibonaccis 13 &gt; 21), while 11/10 is found at 7 Iphs, or it can be<br/>seen also simply as a 9/8 below the &quot;Iph&quot; third.<br/>Iph (1.236 = sqrtof5 - 1) is actually a very important attractor for<br/>the Buzurg series, as well as the inevitable alter ego of Mohajira&apos;s<br/>beginnings of series, because  as it appears in a series of three Iph<br/>neutral thirds, Iph - 1 or the difference tone of this neutral third<br/>= Iph^3 / 8<br/>ex. here : 89 - 72 = 17  = 136/8  in the Iph series 72 : 89 : 110 :<br/>136 : 168 : 204 : 256</p><p>Just one thing about &quot;rast_moha.scl&quot; : this mode example was sent to<br/>Manuel thanks to a good angel (not me), and rast_moha is a perfect<br/>name for that Mohajira mode, but I never advocated this 24-ET tuning<br/>myself. And there are as many better values of Mohajira generators<br/>than 350c. as there are better meantones than 12-ET, if it is !<br/>- - - - - - - -<br/>Jacques</p></div><h3><a id=92958 href="#92958">ðŸ”—</a>genewardsmith &#x3C;genewardsmith@...&#x3E;</h3><span>9/18/2010 11:43:49 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, Jacques Dudon &lt;fotosonix@...&gt; wrote:</p><p>&gt; We can explain it from the solution of Ishku&apos;s recurrent sequence,<br/>&gt; 8x^2 - 8x = 1,  or (sqrt of 6 + 2) /4 = 1.112372436,<br/>&gt; because it is also the arithmetical mean between the semififth (sqrt<br/>&gt; of 6 / 2) and 1/1, that means Ishku tones and  semififths are always<br/>&gt; differentially coherent.</p><p>I&apos;ve asked before and I ask again: could you please define &quot;differentialy coherent&quot;?

The point you raise below about various tunings for a<br/>Rast_Moha mode, combined with one of the examples in the 1/1 article,<br/>leads me to share one possible tuning which may have some spectral<br/>coherence, if that concept can apply to tempered systems, although not<br/>differential coherence.</p><p>Before responding to your explanations, I should seek your help and<br/>advice in addressing my dilemma, now that you have shown why Ishku is<br/>really not the best name for the kind of tetrachord I want to<br/>describe, something like 1/1-11/10-26/21-4/3 (0-165-370-498 cents).<br/>In O3, this tempers to 0-162-369-496 cents or 162-207-127 cents or so.</p><p>This genus differs from Buzurg only in the second step, which is a<br/>high neutral second somewhere around 56/51 or 11/10, rather than a<br/>smaller neutral second around 14/13 or 13/12, the two classic ratios<br/>for medieval Buzurg, of course. Or, we might say that the middle<br/>interval of the tetrachord will be around 8:7 or possibly a bit larger<br/>for Buzurg; but in this genus, it is somewhere around 9:8 or 44:39,<br/>for example.</p><p>Since Ishku -c doesn&apos;t fit so well, I wonder if there&apos;s some other<br/>series that might better fit this kind of tetrachord with a high<br/>neutral second and neutral third. From what you say below about the<br/>Iph -c series, I propose the name Iphi, which, if you agree, I will<br/>use in my Ethno Extras documentation. And maybe I can get through the<br/>last five rotations of Zalzalian 12 by around the end of this month, and move on to other tunings, some of which may not involve this many<br/>articles.</p><p>&gt;  Ishku is a recurrent sequence (and also a rhythm and a fractal<br/>&gt;  waveform), based on an -c algorithm that can be generalised that<br/>&gt;  way :</p><p>&gt;  In a triad C : D : E, if you have E - D = C/8 (in frequencies), C :<br/>&gt;  D : E start a Ishku sequence. Next note will be &quot;F sori&quot;<br/>&gt;  (half-sharp F) and so on, where each new tone will unvariably tend<br/>&gt;  toward 184.36788 c., that is a slightly large 10/9.</p><p>A fascinating point here is that Safi al-Din al-Urmawi comes close to<br/>the first two steps in Ishku -c in his tetrachord &quot;doubling&quot; a 10:9<br/>step: 1/1-10/9-100/81-4/3 or 10:9-10:9-27:25 (182.4-182.4-133.2<br/>cents). But in Ishku, as you explain, three slightly wide 10:9 steps<br/>resolt in a just or near-just 11/8, a relationship I hadn&apos;t<br/>recognized!</p><p>&gt;  The simplest Ishku series I know, and part of it is in this sumer.scl,  is :</p><p>&gt;  (64) 72 80 89 99 ... (80 - 72 = 8, 89 - 80 = 9, 99 - 89 = 10 ... and<br/>&gt;  next numbers will jump 3 octaves up, to 881 and 980)</p><p>&gt;  Seen like this, a Ishku series has not much relation with Rast or<br/>&gt;  Mohajira. But when we look closer, we see they have.  We can<br/>&gt;  explain it from the solution of Ishku&apos;s recurrent sequence, 8x^2 -<br/>&gt;  8x = 1, or (sqrt of 6 + 2) /4 = 1.112372436, because it is also the<br/>&gt;  arithmetical mean between the semififth (sqrt of 6 / 2) and 1/1,<br/>&gt;  that means Ishku tones and semififths are always differentially<br/>&gt;  coherent.</p><p>&gt; For example in the neutral triad 40 : 49 : 60 that we find in<br/>&gt; sumer.scl between D and A,</p><p>&gt;  40 + 49 = 89 = E<br/>&gt;  and 89 - 80 = 49 - 40 = C.</p><p>This 40:49:60 triad is something I didn&apos;t notice when looking at the<br/>scale, although now, when I read your message, it&apos;s very close:<br/>10/9-49/36-5/3 or 40/36 : 49/36 : 60/36.</p><p>&gt;  By co?ncidence, but harmony is based on those, three Ishku tones<br/>&gt;  are very close to 11/8 (we verify it in the series above in the<br/>&gt;  ratio between 72 and 99).</p><p>&gt;  11/8 or similar have two occurences in Rast, same in Mohajira, it&apos;s<br/>&gt;  another possible bridge with Ishku.</p><p>Yes, 11/8 or the like will come up, for example, as a neutral third<br/>around 11:9 plus a step around 9:8. This may be especially notable in<br/>the Arab Maqam Sikah, where the lower pentachord may be something like<br/>1/1-88/81-11/9-11/8-3/2 or 0-143-347-551-702 cents, if we follow<br/>al-Farabi&apos;s version of Zalzal&apos;s tuning (143-204-204-151 cents). In O3,<br/>where the smaller neutral second of this general type of Sikah is<br/>narrower but the tone a bit wider than a just 9:8, we have something<br/>like 0-138-346-554-704 cents.</p><p>&gt;  Then the fact that Ishku^3 ~11/8, because of other coherences and<br/>&gt;  natural reasons suggests musical Ishku-based pentachords, ending<br/>&gt;  with a fifth, such as 72 : 80 : 89 : 99 : 108</p><p>&gt;  Here we find that 99 - 72 = 27 and 108 - 99 = 9 (pure 3/2 fifths),<br/>&gt;  but the Ishku fractal value can also suggest -c corresponding<br/>&gt;  fifths of 703.592 and 708.4936 c... that I know you may not<br/>&gt;  dislike!</p><p>Yes, these extended fifths are not unpleasant to me! Curiously, George<br/>Secor&apos;s 29-HTT or 29-note version of his &quot;High Tolerance Temperament&quot;<br/>uses a generator of 703.579 cents.</p><p>&gt;  In conclusion, in absence of 80 (or 88, since 88 - 79 = 9 is also<br/>&gt;  of a Ishku kind) the sumer.scl subset 72 : 79 : 89 : 96 will only<br/>&gt;  be an uncomplete example of a Ishku tetrachord, nevertheless with<br/>&gt;  96 - 89 = 79 - 72 = 7 it has some other qualities that need to be<br/>&gt;  explored.</p><p>Thank you for explaining that this tetrachord is related to Ishku but<br/>incomplete in terms of this -c system, so that another name would be<br/>better.</p><p>&gt;  What comes to my mind about this tetrachord is that it could also<br/>&gt;  be generated by an &quot;Iph&quot; series (that&apos;s how I call a generator of<br/>&gt;  2/Phi), since 144 the octave of 72 is precisely the following<br/>&gt;  Fibonacci after 89, and 144/89 ~1,618, same thing with your<br/>&gt;  original 21 : 26 (Fibonaccis 13 &gt; 21), while 11/10 is found at 7<br/>&gt;  Iphs, or it can be seen also simply as a 9/8 below the &quot;Iph&quot; third.</p><p>Am I right that 11/10 would here be represented by 89/81 (163.060<br/>cents), a bit closer than 161.719 cents in O3?</p><p>If this -c system seems to fit -- as it does to me -- then maybe we<br/>could call a tetrachord of 1/1-11/10-26/21-4/3 or the like &quot;Iphi,&quot; a<br/>name I find euphonious with the final vowel. Then Iph -c would be the<br/>name of the series, and Iphi the name of this type of tetrachord,<br/>basically like Buzurg with a higher neutral second.</p><p>&gt;  Iph (1.236 = sqrtof5 - 1) is actually a very important attractor<br/>&gt;  for the Buzurg series, as well as the inevitable alter ego of<br/>&gt;  Mohajira&apos;s beginnings of series, because as it appears in a series<br/>&gt;  of three Iph neutral thirds, Iph - 1 or the difference tone of this<br/>&gt;  neutral third = Iph^3 / 8</p><p>&gt;  ex. here : 89 - 72 = 17  = 136/8  in the Iph series<br/>&gt;  72 : 89 : 110 : 136 : 168 : 204 : 256</p><p>As an aside, I might mention that this series includes 136:168:204 or<br/>14:17:21, the simplest division of the fifth into two neutral thirds,<br/>as George Secor pointed out to me around nine years ago.</p><p>&gt;  Just one thing about &quot;rast_moha.scl&quot; : this mode example was sent<br/>&gt;  to Manuel thanks to a good angel (not me), and rast_moha is a<br/>&gt;  perfect name for that Mohajira mode, but I never advocated this<br/>&gt;  24-ET tuning myself. And there are as many better values of<br/>&gt;  Mohajira generators than 350c. as there are better meantones than<br/>&gt;  12-ET, if it is !</p><p>Certainly it is possible to choose a range of single generators for<br/>Mohajira, and your analogy with 12-ET and meantone very nicely makes<br/>the point that 24-ET is not the only option!</p><p>However, what especially interests me is the possibility of obtaining<br/>Mohajira and the rast_moha mode through what you have nicely and more<br/>generally termed an Entrelacs or &quot;interlace&quot; system where we alternate<br/>two neutral third generators of different sizes.</p><p>For example, here is an O3 version of rast_moha inspired by some of<br/>your -c Mohajira tunings, and meant to seek a certain degree of<br/>spectral although not differential coherence, if this is possible in a<br/>temperament.

It is very exciting to see how<br/>our discussion has led you to a kind of Iph -c meantone, which in turn<br/>has caused me to explore some structures with extended fifths which<br/>might be in some ways similar.</p><p>&gt;  As I said, that it could also be generated by an &quot;Iph&quot; series (a<br/>&gt;  generator of 2/Phi), since 144 the octave of 72 is precisely the<br/>&gt;  following Fibonacci after 89 and 144/89 ~1,618, same thing with<br/>&gt;  your original 21 : 26 (Fibonaccis 13 &gt; 21), while 11/10 is found at<br/>&gt;  7 Iphs...</p><p>An interesting point is that Ibn Sina has 21/13 in his Shur-like<br/>tuning with tetrachords of 12:13:14:16 or 28:26:24:21, but I&apos;m not<br/>sure if he uses 11/10 in some of his tunings, although Safi al-Din<br/>al-Urmawi does some two centuries later. We can get Iphi as a<br/>permutation of Safi al-Din&apos;s tetrachord which Ozan nicely terms<br/>&quot;medium sundered,&quot; 1/1-9/8-99/80-4/3 or 9:8-11:10-320:297, reversing<br/>the order of the first two intervals (0-165-369-498 cents).</p><p>And 89:144 as part of Fibonacci&apos;s series and also a fine approximation<br/>of Phi is really neat! Scala shows it is narrow of Phi by 0.06 cents<br/>or so.</p><p>&gt; The middle tone of this tetrachord, thus resulting of six Phi<br/>&gt; ratios, gave me the idea of a great system based on the Iph series !</p><p>&gt; I have been many times attracted by this quite harmonic co?ncidence,<br/>&gt; that Phi^6 ~ 18, that we find in the Fibonaccis between 8 and 144 -<br/>&gt; (also a  common co?ncidence between Phi&apos;s main series F and P) -</p><p>&gt; It is in fact one meantone away from 16, that suggests a meantone<br/>&gt; fifth of (Phi^6 /8)^1/2 = 1.497676196228...  and a planar<br/>&gt; temperament based on Iph and this meantone fifth as generators.</p><p>If I am correct, this fifth would be close to 1/8-comma meantone.</p><p>&gt; This works remarquably well and allows many versions, from simple<br/>&gt; ribbon temperament (one single fifth translation) to planar<br/>&gt; temperaments, using several fifths by rows.</p><p>Here I might quickly comment that my 24-note temperaments with<br/>extended fifths tend to be ribbon temperaments with two 12-note<br/>chains. For example, in O3, the fifths are at 703.125 or 704.297<br/>cents, with a single translation, if I am using your language<br/>correctly, of 57.422 cents. However, as you point out, with something<br/>like your Iph meantone there is no reason we might not have a planar<br/>temperament with several rows or chains of fifths!</p><p>&gt; They all lead to different canvas of 36 tones/octave, so nothing<br/>&gt; really new, except these are unequal versions, entirely generated by<br/>&gt; Phi, along with specific -c qualities and possible appropriate<br/>&gt; applications with Phi timbres.</p><p>Here I am curious how the 36 tones would be arranged in terms of the<br/>numbers of rows of generators and so forth. I do recognize that some<br/>of the intervals such as Phi, Iph, 8/7, etc., are very nicely served<br/>by 36-EDO, with your meantone generator at about 699.27 cents not too<br/>far from 700 cents; but the differences could be very interesting.</p><p>&gt; Here is for example such a &quot;meantone-Iph&quot; version of a scale based on two diatonic tetrachords similar to yours :<br/>   ! meso-iph7.scl<br/>   !<br/>   Neutral diatonic variation based on two Iph fractal series<br/>    7<br/>   !<br/>    3072/2783<br/>    3440/2783<br/>    3712/2783<br/>    4168/2783<br/>    4608/2783<br/>    224/121<br/>    2/1<br/>   !

Dudon 2010</p><p>&gt;  I found the neutral diatonic (7 notes above) very charming and<br/>&gt;  Malagasy-like (the mode of F, along with the Bb variation, brings<br/>&gt;  this magnificent Rast option you mentionned for the first<br/>&gt;  tetrachord), while the additional tones, close to 13/12 (47), 8/7<br/>&gt;  (199), 17/12 (123), 7/4 (76) and 9/5 (155) bring more<br/>&gt;  Middle-East-style variations.</p><p>Please let me confirm a few points to be sure I have understood<br/>correctly, and agree that these are indeed delightful options! The<br/>charming &quot;Malagasy-like&quot; diatonic I take to be this, based on Scala:</p><p> 0-171.0-366.9-498.7-699.3-873.0-1066.2-2/1</p><p>This is what I might term an &quot;equable heptatonic,&quot; meaning that it has<br/>some qualities of a division not too far from 7-EDO, as with the steps<br/>of 171 and 174 cents (C-D and G-A).</p><p>Zest-24, based on Zarlino&apos;s 2/7-comma meantone, has something a bit<br/>like this:</p><p> 0-171.2-362.8-504.2-695.8-867.0-1058.7-2/1</p><p>With the F mode using Bb, I see that we indeed get a Rast_Iphi form,<br/>to use a term analogous to Rast_Moha:</p><p> 0-200.6-374.3-501.8-701.3-872.4-1068.3-2/1</p><p>&gt;  I like the very oriental interaction of the &quot;8/7&quot; (199) with E<br/>&gt;  (215) and F (29) - and also the &quot;13/12&quot; (47, definitively<br/>&gt;  Buzurg-genre) along with E (215), F (29), G (521), A (18), and<br/>&gt;  Bb(155).</p><p>Oh yes, I agree that, for example, on C, 2783:3008:3440:3712 at<br/>0-134.6-366.9-498.7 cents is quintessential Buzurg! And I see lots of<br/>options for septimal slendros, including a location with 49:32.</p><p>&gt;  Of course all these could be expressed in simpler ratios. But it&apos;s<br/>&gt;  interesting to hear the specific color Phi brings in here.</p><p>Yes, both Phi itself, and some close approximations like 155/96 and<br/>76/47. These slight variations give this type of -c system some of the<br/>same charms celebrated by George Secor for unequal temperaments<br/>generally. Looking again at the intervals in meso-iph12.scl, I wonder<br/>if your 36-note tuning might be -c variation on 36-EDO.</p><p>With an extended fifth &quot;ribbon&quot; tuning like O3, I find that I can get<br/>_some_ of the same Near Eastern genres and modes, but not all of them<br/>or in the same relationships or with the same subtle variety.</p><p>Congratulations on the Meso-Iph family of -c tunings!</p><p>With many thanks,</p><p>Margo</p></div><h3><a id=93222 href="#93222">ðŸ”—</a>Margo Schulter &#x3C;mschulter@...&#x3E;</h3><span>9/22/2010 9:52:51 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>----------------------------------<br/>               Ethno Extras: Zalzalian 12 set<br/>                     Part 6: Rotation 7<br/>             ----------------------------------</p><p>[To preserve formatting as much as possible, please try the Use<br/>Fixed Font Width option if viewing on the Yahoo site.]</p><p>Hello, all.</p><p>To provide a convenient &quot;itinerary&quot; for the Zalzalian 12 set, so that<br/>people can keep track of where we&apos;ve been and where we&apos;re going, I&apos;ll<br/>place at the beginning of each part a summary of the rotations adapted<br/>from Scala output.

Each<br/>dastgah or avaz, in turn, consists of a series or suite of gusheh-ha<br/>or modal themes, so that a performance in a given dastgah or avaz<br/>consists of a sequence of gusheh-ha, many of them performed in a more<br/>or less standard order, starting with a Daramad or opening piece<br/>introducing the main focus of the modal family, and then progressing<br/>through gusheh-ha which may either retain the modal focus of the<br/>Daramad or serve themselves as independent modes, with the sequence<br/>usually returning eventually to the modality of the opening.</p><p>While it is possible to speak of &quot;the radif&quot; in the singular, from a<br/>practical perspective one often speaks in the plural of radif-ha, the<br/>&quot;radif-s&quot; of different adept masters and teachers. For example, these<br/>different radif-ha might differ on the question of whether the mode<br/>known as Bayat-e Kord, the &quot;song or verses of the Kurd,&quot; should be<br/>considered as a gusheh, for example of Shur, or as an avaz or<br/>satellite dastgah in its own right.</p><p>The radif is enriched by the fact that while some gusheh-ha may be<br/>specific to a certain dastgah, others may be performed as part of more<br/>than one dastgah, or &quot;modal suite&quot; as it might be translated in one<br/>sense. From the perspective of the Islamic maqam system out which the<br/>Persian dastgah system seems to have grown around the 17th-18th<br/>centuries, the latter might be seen as a more structured and often<br/>condensed version of the modulations from one maqam to another which<br/>are a vital aspect of the Near Eastern tradition.</p><p>The concept of a dastgah as a modal family or &quot;suite of gusheh-ha&quot; is<br/>helpful in appreciating the intricacies of looking for a &quot;scale,&quot; or<br/>better a gamut, of pitches for the main gusheh-ha of a given dastgah,<br/>here Dastgah-e Shur (&quot;the dastgah of Shur&quot;).</p><p>Happily, our Zalzalian 12 set in this rotation includes what might be<br/>called the nine basic steps of Shur, with the caution that there are<br/>significant distinctions between octaves, and that the most relevant<br/>steps may vary from gusheh to gusheh. Here I will give Persian note<br/>names starting from G, one standard note for the final of Shur, and<br/>using ASCII &quot;p&quot; for the sign of the koron, an inflection often<br/>lowering a note by about 50-70 cents, or 1/4 to 1/3 of a tone.</p><p>   G     Ap      Bb       C      Dp      D     Eb    Ep      F      G<br/>  0.0   138.3   264.8   495.7   634.0  703.1  760.5 841.4  968.0 1200.0 ~ 1/1   13/12    7/6     4/3    13/9    3/2   14/9  13/8    7/4    2/1</p><p>The lower tetrachord above the final G defines much of the essence of<br/>the Shur family: two neutral second steps, here 138.3-126.6 cents or<br/>very close to 12:13:14, together forming a minor third, with a tone or<br/>major second then completing the fourth. Our division of this fourth<br/>is very close to 12:13:14:16 with a near-just 7:6 minor third followed<br/>by a likewise almost pure 8:7 tone, either the original version or<br/>possibly a permutation of Ibn Sina&apos;s tuning in the early 11th century<br/>with steps of 14:13, 13:12, and 8:7.</p><p>In practice, the tuning of Shur can and does vary considerably, with<br/>Dariouche Safvate in 1966 reporting measurements showing one tuning of<br/>around 0-136-276-500 cents (136-140-224 cents) for this lower<br/>tetrachord. While minor thirds at or not too far from the septimal<br/>ratio of 7/6 may have been popular in Persian music during at least<br/>the millennium from the writings of Ibn Sina to the present, wider<br/>varieties at around 13/11 (289 cents) or 32?27 (294 cents) seem also<br/>commmon.</p><p>In one way, our 12:13:14:16 arrangement may not be the most<br/>characteristic: there is a general preference, at least in theory, for<br/>the smaller neutral second to come first, as also with the Arab Maqam<br/>Bayyati as understood by many traditional performers. However, with<br/>minor thirds of various sizes, one can find measured tunings in which<br/>the smaller and larger neutral seconds occur in either order, as well<br/>as tunings in which they are virtually equal in size, sometimes<br/>closely approaching the 140-140-220 cents recommended as a model for<br/>Shur by the Iranian master Dr. Dariush Tala&grave;i.</p><p>Our simple tuning set for the octave above the final of Shur also<br/>shows the flexible nature of two degrees. The fifth of Shur, known in<br/>Persian as a _moteqayyer_ or variable note, has both a 3/2 version (D)<br/>and a lowered version at D-koron or Dp, here around 13/9. One<br/>characteristic use of the lowered or koron version is in descending<br/>passages moving from the middle or upper portion of the octave down<br/>again toward the final. The lowered fifth might serve as a top pitch<br/>in a phrase, e.g. C-Dp-C-Bb-Ap-A, or as a pleasant nuance in a descent<br/>from the more common minor version of the sixth step through the four<br/>to the lower or main tetrachord, e.g. Eb-Dp-C-Bb-Ap-Bb-Ap-A. Note that<br/>the figure Eb-Dp-C or ~14/9-13/9-4/3 has a descending 14:13:12 pattern like that of the lower tetrachord at approximately 16:14:13:12.</p><p>Additionally, the Dp or 13/9 step is very common in gusheh-ha of Shur<br/>which effectively transpose the lower tetrachord up a fourth to the<br/>4/3 step: C-Dp-Eb-F. Here a caution is that while the O3 system would<br/>have a 16/9 step available to permit a form of this tetrachord with a<br/>usual fourth, in Zalzalian 12 our available choice is approximately<br/>4/3-13/9-14/9=7/4 with a narrow fourth at 472.3 cents, near 21:16.<br/>Narrow tetrachords do sometimes occur in traditional Persian music, as<br/>with a fourth at 484 cents reported by Safvate for the old version of<br/>Avaz-e Bayat-e Tork (the &quot;verses or song of the Turk,&quot; referring not<br/>to the Turks of Anatolia but to the Turkic ethnic communities of<br/>Iran), known as the &quot;old Tork.&quot;</p><p>The usual &quot;textbook&quot; form of Shur shows a minor sixth, in our Persian<br/>notation Eb at 760.5 cents or a narrow 14/9 (actually closer to the JI<br/>ratio of 273/176 at 760 cents), and in other styles of tuning closer<br/>to 11/7 (782 cents) or 52/33 (787 cents), for example. In fact, this<br/>is the most common form of the sixth degree above the final in modern<br/>Shur, although the neutral sixth form, with a Persian spelling here of<br/>Ep at 841.4 cents or a near-just 13/8, also occurs, with the gusheh of<br/>Gereyli as the notable example I found in some published radif-ha.</p><p>As a usual diagram of the octave above the final cannot itself show,<br/>however, the neutral form of this step, or rather its counterpoint an<br/>octave lower in the tetrachord _below_ the final, is standard, a point<br/>especially brought home by the tuning of instruments such as the<br/>traditional Persian santur where for Shur, again using our present<br/>Persian spelling, Ep in the octave below the final but Eb above it<br/>would be the norm. In our septimal version of Shur, the tetrachord<br/>below the final with its &quot;neutral sixth&quot; degree -- or, more precisely,<br/>the degree a neutral third below the final, here about 13/16 -- is as<br/>follows:</p><p>        D     Ep      F      G<br/>      703.1  841.4  968.0 1200.0<br/>     -496.9 -358.6 -232.0   0.0<br/>       3/4   13/16   7/8    1/1</p><p>This Shur tetrachord (here also near 12:13:14:16) below the final<br/>plays a prominent role in the _forud_ or approach to the cadence, with<br/>Hormoz Farhat describing one common formula as moving from the third<br/>below to the second below to the final. In the suite performance that<br/>defines a dastgah, the forud serves as a unifying device reaffirming<br/>the resting note for the dastgah as a whole, in contrast to the often<br/>diverse modalities and modal centers for the various gusheh-ha.</p><p>One nuance of Shur not supported in this Zalzalian 12 version is the<br/>tendency in the upper octave to lower the step a second -- or rather<br/>ninth -- above the final from neutral to minor. Again using our<br/>Persian spelling, it would thus be customary on the santur to use the<br/>neutral second Ap but the minor ninth Ab, an option available at this<br/>location in the 24-note O3 system but not this 12-note subset. While<br/>much beautiful music can be played using only the neutral ninth, the<br/>minor version of this step does add an expressive element worth<br/>seeking when it is available. As we shall see, such an extra step,<br/>often in O3 at around 1281 cents or 44/21 (22/21 plus an octave), is<br/>very desirable in a dedicated Shur tuning.</p><p>A step not listed in usual presentations of this dastgah, but which I<br/>have found useful in Shur-based polyphony, is found in this rotation<br/>at 472.3 cents or slightly wide of 21/16, forming a perfect fifth<br/>below the 7/4 step.</p><p>Here I should emphasize that the dastgah tradition is itself mainly<br/>monophonic, although a drone technique is common in some forms of<br/>Persian music and medieval theorists such as Ibn Sina discuss a<br/>technique of _tarqib_ or &quot;composite&quot; sound in which the performer<br/>plays two notes at the same time, for example at a fourth or a<br/>fifth. (The more common sense of tarqib in the world of maqam means a<br/>&quot;mixture&quot; of two or often several maqamat recognized as a compound<br/>maqam.)</p><p>Polyphonic offshoots of dastgah music may range from discreet<br/>arrangements of traditional themes seeking to keep the main focus on<br/>melodic development, using moveable drones for example, to freer<br/>styles where some of the steps and intervals of a given modal system<br/>serve as the basis for an improvisation or composition which may not<br/>necessarily follow any traditional pattern of development. While<br/>styles at various points along this continuum will draw on resources<br/>such as polyphonic cadences involving neutral steps and intervals,<br/>freer styles may showcase &quot;ostentatious&quot; sonorities which might be<br/>considered a bit too bold or striking for contexts where the desire is<br/>more subtly to reinforce and adorn the flow of a traditonal theme.</p><p>An example leaning to the freer side is _Prelude in Shur for Erv<br/>Wilson_, a piece illustrating the use of the 21/16 step:</p><p>&lt;<a href="http://www.bestII.com/~mschulter/Prelude_in_Shur_for_Erv_Wilson.mp3">http://www.bestII.com/~mschulter/Prelude_in_Shur_for_Erv_Wilson.mp3</a>&gt;</p><p>Here is an unmeasured JI notation for the opening, showing some uses<br/>of 21/16. My convention is that all notes are sustained until the end<br/>of the passage, or until an &quot;r&quot; sign shows a rest.</p><p> 2/1    7/4   13/8   7/4  2/1  13/8  7/4  273/176  3/2<br/> 3/2    3/2   13/8        3/2       21/16          3/2<br/> 3/2   21/16  13/12   r<br/> 1/1    1/1   13/12       1/1        7/8           1/1...</p><p>As seen, after the initial 2:3:4, a highlight of the opening is the<br/>four-voice sonority 16:21:24:28, used according to Kyle Gann by<br/>LaMonte Young as early as the 1960&apos;s, and later advocated by Keenan<br/>Pepper and others. This sonority, which I would rather on the<br/>ostentatious side for a more unassuming style of dastgah-based<br/>polyphony supporting a familiar gusheh, resolves to the fifth<br/>13/12-13/8, the texture for the rest of the passage is in three parts,<br/>with the second voice arbitrarily assigned a rest to show this change<br/>in texture.</p><p>The highest voice next moves into a 13/12-13/8-7/4 or 26:39:42<br/>sonority (here a tempered 0-703-830 cents), with a striking 127-cent<br/>small neutral second near 14:13 between the upper voices, and a<br/>near-just 21:13 between the outer voices. The outer neutral sixth<br/>expands to an octave and the upper neutral second to a fourth,<br/>arriving at 1/1-3/2-2/1 on the final. Then the upper voice descends a<br/>large neutral third, presenting us with 1/1-3/2-13/8 or 8:12:13, a<br/>neutral sixth sonority including the rather tense 13:12 between the<br/>upper voices, but somewhat less tense or more blending than the<br/>previous shading of 26:39:42 because of the harmonic 13:8 neutral<br/>sixth. The resolution follows the same basic pattern, with the neutral<br/>sixth expanding to an octave and the neutral second to an upper<br/>fourth, thus arriving at 7/8-21/16-7/4, a 2:3:4 on the step at a<br/>septimal 8:7 tone below the final.</p><p>Then the upper voice descends by a tone from 7/4 to a degree which<br/>might have specified as an approximate 14/9 but is more accurately<br/>called 273/176, since the notation 7/4-21/16-273/176 accurately shows<br/>that this minor seventh sonority is very close to a just 22:33:39,<br/>with an upper minor third at 13:11, or here not quite a cent narrower<br/>at 288.3 cents. The minor seventh contracts to a fifth, and the upper<br/>minor third to a unison, thus arriving at 1/1-3/2 and concluding this<br/>opening section.</p><p>In a more conservative or less ostentatious style, maybe of the<br/>progressions between the two outer voices, for example, might be<br/>routinely used, as well as a &quot;thickening&quot; of the texture to three<br/>voices for certain important cadences, for example. However, the<br/>balance would be more toward a melody with some polyphonic adornment,<br/>rather than a free polyphonic prelude drawing on the steps of<br/>Dastgah-e Shur.</p><p>Another type of mode with a Near Eastern flavor supported by this<br/>rotation is a variation on Jacques Dudon&apos;s Ibina series. a<br/>differentially coherent (-c) form of what might be termed<br/>Mohajira-Bayyati or &quot;Moha_Baya&quot; for short. The original form of the<br/>beautiful Ibina, closely approximated in O3 although not in this<br/>subset, is as follows:</p><p>    72      78       88      96      108     117    128     144<br/>    1/1    13/12    11/9     4/3     3/2    13/8    16/9    2/1<br/>    0.0    138.6    347.4   498.0   702.0  840.5    996.1  1200.0</p><p>In this rotation, we have a variant form which unfortunately does not<br/>share the -c property, but at least to me has its own appeal. Here I<br/>show the frequency ratios and cents for a JI version, followed by the<br/>tempered values present in the Zalzalian 12 version:</p><p>    72      78       88      96      108     117    126      144<br/>    1/1    13/12    11/9     4/3     3/2    13/8    7/4      2/1<br/>    0.0    138.6    347.4   498.0   702.0  840.5   968.8    1200.0<br/>    0.0    138.3    345.7   495.7   703.1  841.4   968.0    1200.0</p><p>The one difference between these two forms is the minor seventh, at<br/>72:128 or 16:9 in the Ibina -c tuning, but at 72:126 or 7:4 in this<br/>variant, a difference of 128:126 or 64:63, the septimal or Archytan<br/>comma (27.26 cents).</p><p>In either form, we have a lower tetrachord with one flavor of Dudon&apos;s<br/>Mohajira with its general pattern of neutral second, tone, and neutral<br/>second, here 1/1-13/12-11/9-4/3 or 13:12-44:39-12:11. The upper<br/>tetrachord on the 3/2 step is some shading of the Arab Bayyati type<br/>(in Turkey, one type of Maqam Ushshaq), with a pattern of two neutral<br/>seconds, the first often smaller, plus a tone. Ibina proper has a<br/>tetrachord of 1/1-13/12-32/27-4/3 or 13/12-128:117-9:8, while our<br/>septimal variation approximates Ibn Sina&apos;s 1/1-13/12-7/6-4/3 or<br/>13:12-14:13-8:7 tuning for a tetrachord which might fit a variety of<br/>modern Persian Shur or Arab Bayyati.</p><p>While a near-septimal intonation of Shur has been documented by<br/>Safvate, the Lebanese teacher and theorist Ali Jihad Racy may be<br/>describing a somewhat similar flavor of Bayyati when he demonstrates,<br/>as reported by Scott Marcus, that the minor third of Bayyati should be<br/>played notably lower than would result from using a regular fret at<br/>the Pythagorean third or 32/27 (294 cents). Whether this difference is<br/>often taken as about a septimal comma remains an open question which<br/>measurements by scholars such as Amine Beyhom might help to resolve.</p><p>In addition to Dastgah-e Shur and our variation on Jacques Dudon&apos;s<br/>Ibina, we have available a couple of forms of septimal slendro. The<br/>first represents a very simple and harmonious form of septimal<br/>pentatonic (e.g. slendro5_2.scl in the Scala archive):</p><p>    12      14       16       18       21       24<br/>    1/1     7/6      4/3      3/2      7/4      2/1<br/>    0.0    266.9    498.0    702.0    968.8    1200.0<br/>    0.0    264.8    495.7    703.1    968.0    1200.0</p><p>Another form (see slendro_7_4.scl) from Lou Harrison and Jacques<br/>Dudon, called NAT, uses 21/16 rather than 4/3:</p><p>    48      56       63       72       84       96<br/>    1/1     7/6     21/16     3/2      7/4      2/1<br/>    0.0    266.9    470.7    702.0    968.8    1200.0<br/>    0.0    264.8    472.3    703.1    968.0    1200.0</p><p>Erv Wilson&apos;s 1-3-7-9 hexany uses these same five steps plus a 9/8 step<br/>not present in this rotation of Zalzalian 12, but available in<br/>Rotation 0, as was discussed in the first article of these series.</p><p>Most appreciatively,</p><p>Margo Schulter<br/>mschulter@...</p></div>
