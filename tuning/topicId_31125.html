Has<br/>&gt; anyone ever used this scale in a composition?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Kalle</p><p>I&apos;m deeply interested in a set of similar 14-tone scales, which I<br/>call &quot;double diatonic&quot;. They can be tuned for example in 26-tET,<br/>where they each consist of two interweaved meantone diatonic scales.<br/>In one version, the two diatonic scales are a half-octave apart, and<br/>each completes _all_ of the other&apos;s 5-limit triads into 7-limit<br/>tetrads (12 in all). I&apos;m waiting to find out where this shows up on<br/>Gene&apos;s ranking.</p></div>
