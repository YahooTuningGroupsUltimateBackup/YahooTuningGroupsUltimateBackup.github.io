Alternately,<br/>&gt; maybe we need to find a new &quot;optimal&quot; leading tone - maybe the 70 cent<br/>&gt; interval in 19-equal works so well because of the intervals it&apos;s<br/>&gt; approximating, and now that we&apos;re using 10:13:15 for our base triad<br/>&gt; instead of 4:5:6, there will be a new ideal leading tone.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; ! parizekmic14.scl<br/>&gt; &gt; !<br/>&gt; &gt; Parizekmic[14] (676/675 tempering), POTE tuning<br/>&gt; &gt; 14<br/>&gt; &gt; !<br/>&gt; &gt; 44.44614<br/>&gt; &gt; 204.44309<br/>&gt; &gt; 248.88923<br/>&gt; &gt; 293.33536<br/>&gt; &gt; 453.33232<br/>&gt; &gt; 497.77845<br/>&gt; &gt; 657.77541<br/>&gt; &gt; 702.22155<br/>&gt; &gt; 746.66768<br/>&gt; &gt; 906.66464<br/>&gt; &gt; 951.11077<br/>&gt; &gt; 995.55691<br/>&gt; &gt; 1155.55386<br/>&gt; &gt; 2/1<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; And this is the chromatic version, which I haven&apos;t messed around with much yet.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; -Mike<br/>&gt;</p></div><h3><a id=95613 href="#95613">ðŸ”—</a>genewardsmith &#x3C;genewardsmith@...&#x3E;</h3><span>1/17/2011 2:24:04 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, Mike Battaglia &lt;battaglia01@...&gt; wrote:</p><p>&gt; I guess it&apos;s up to Petr, ultimately, but I wish we could give this one<br/>&gt; some kind of programmatic name.</p><p>Petr didn&apos;t come up with it, and didn&apos;t seem to have an opinion on the name, so it&apos;s really still open.

If I want to take an image, it&apos;s something like a house with a bunch of orphan kids playing together (5, 7,  13, 15, 39, 41, 45, etc. and others), while nobody knows what happened with the parents (1, 3, 9...).<br/>After the 6/29 notes MOS of the sequence a relatively small interval increases the precedents every 29 generations, and the first 2^n  approximation is found only 83 generators after the &quot;7&quot; point, himself 12 generators after the &quot;5&quot; point. And the next more satisfying MOS after 29 if my calculations are correct, is found with 251 udo (in which the generator is 52 steps).<br/>So instead, the first direction I tested was to combine two Bala sequences, one of which would bring back the &quot;missing fundamentals&quot; of the initial sequence.<br/>It is very easy to generate such a sequence from the first one, as many -c properties would offer it, such as :<br/>15 - 13 = 2<br/>7 - 5 = 2<br/>13 - 10 = 3, etc.<br/>but the most precise technique I found was to use the Fibonacci numbers triad 13 - 8 = 5 to define a minor sixth above a term (n), by the difference between 4 times the term (n - 3) generations and the term (n ),<br/>ex. in 208 240 277 320,<br/>(4*208) - 320 = 512 = (8/5)*320.<br/>Applying this simple -c algorithm the associated ribbon sequence goes :<br/>216 250 288 332 384 443 512 ... etc., which basically transposes the first scale by 12/13, along with extraordinary precise 16/13, 16/15, 8/5, 6/5 etc. intervals and complements.</p><p>This second sequence divides each step of the 29 notes cycle of the first sequence in approximatively 2/3 + 1/3 step, this means the whole thing could be roughly approximated by a 87-edo.<br/>This is a good example of what I call a &quot;ribbon temperament&quot; which could be translated - I think - as a rank 3 temperament using the compilation of a linear temperament, and its single transposition by a complementary interval.<br/>The whole thing is incredible, as it combines African pentatonics, Eolian modes, Ethiopian and Japanese scales, Pelogs, Mohajiras, etc., etc., in superb kaleidoscopic harmonies with many [9:6:4] chords.<br/>Even with only 12 notes such a scale I experimented with delight is :</p><p>! bala_ribbon.scl<br/>!<br/>Parizekmic scale based on a double Bala sequence<br/> 12<br/>!<br/> 25/24<br/> 9/8<br/> 6/5<br/> 13/10<br/> 4/3<br/> 83/60<br/> 3/2<br/> 8/5<br/> 26/15<br/> 9/5<br/>39/20<br/> 2/1<br/>!
