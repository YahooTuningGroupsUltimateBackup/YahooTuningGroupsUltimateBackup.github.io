What facets of<br/>music, for example, are inescapable? Tension/release? Scales? Notes?<br/>Vibrations? Would music in a galaxy billions of light years away sound<br/>different than ours? How about the Krell music in &quot;Forbidden Planet?&quot;<br/>How WOULD one come up with something totally &quot;new?&quot; Do new things<br/>necessarily build on the past, or can something totally unrelated to<br/>what came before be created in music?Are we, as humans, bound by certain<br/>limits, which we can never transcend?  This music would be new compared<br/>to what? Was bebop new? Debussy&apos;s concepts? Hendrix and feedback/sounds?<br/>I would love to hear what Erlich means...perhaps he would care to<br/>elaborate...or better yet, demonstrate aurally...it&apos;s a fascinating<br/>idea, to be sure...It reminds me a bit of a student of mine(18 years<br/>old), who didn&apos;t want to learn scales or chords, or anyone else&apos;s music,<br/>and wanted to come up with something totaly different from everyone<br/>else. I am indeed curious as to how that could happen...and I am not<br/>saying it couldn&apos;t. I would love to hear it. I hope Paul&apos;s idea is not<br/>simply an empty intellectual exercise...to put it into practice would<br/>be, indeed, a quantum leap...Hstick</p></div><h3><a id=1106 href="#1106">ðŸ”—</a>Joseph L Monzo &#x3C;monz@xxxx.xxxx&#x3E;</h3><span>2/28/1999 10:40:43 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>I found your pondering of &quot;new music&quot;<br/>interesting, Niel.
