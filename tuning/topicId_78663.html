Since hundred years ago, perfect fifths and fourths are the references used to classify the scales; their consonance degrees are unquestionable.</p><p>If we have to accept the equal tempered scale imperfection at least we could introduce in this scale the two perfect consonances. It means two temperaments: The first one controls the tone frequencies that work between C=1 and the new F = 1,3333.. The second section would comprise F, F# and G; this section has a range of (3/2)/(4/3) = (9/8) = 1,125. The third section is comprised between  C = 2 and G = 1,5 with a range of (4/3) = 1,33333., the same range of the first section. So the first and third sections include five equal intervals each. Let us see the detailed proposal :</p><p>MODIFIED EQUAL TEMPERED SCALE</p><p>First section semitone factor = (4/3)0,2= 1,05922384105:</p><p>C   ... 1</p><p>C# ... 1,05922384105</p><p>D  ... 1,12195514545</p><p>Eb ..  1,18840163865</p><p>E ...  1,2587833484***</p><p>F ...  1,33333333333</p><p>Second section semitone factor = (9/8)0,5= 1,06066017178:</p><p>F# ..  20,5= 1,41421356237</p><p>G  ...  (3/2) = 1,5</p><p>Third section semitone factor = (4/3)0,2= 1,05922384105. The same as for the first section:</p><p>Ab ... 1,58883576157</p><p>A ...  1,68293271817</p><p>Bb ... 1,78260245796</p><p>B  ..  1,88817502259</p><p>2C ...  2</p><p>Also the major thirds problem might be reduced.</p><p>It is much better to make an approach to the final scale than to maintain a rather imperfect one.</p><p>I suggest you to make a comparison with the equal tempered scale.</p><p>I would appreciate it if you could give me your opinion on this matter.</p><p>Thanks</p><p>Mario Pizarro</p><p>Lima, October 02</p><p>piagui@...</p></div>
