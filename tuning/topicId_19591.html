Erlich said:</p><p>Well, the frequency ratios of the noble &quot;additive&quot; or &quot;logarithmic&quot;<br/>generators are 2^phi or 2^noble, which don&apos;t share the properties of the<br/>noble ratios themselves. While the noble ratios have continued fraction<br/>representations that end in all 1&apos;s, 2^phi, for example, has C.F.:</p><p>1 + 1/(1 + 1/(1 + 1/(6 + 1/(1 + 1/(2 + 1/(4 + 1/(1 + 1/(52 + 1/(2 + 1/(5 +<br/>1/(4 + 1/(1 + 1/(106...)))))))))))))</p><p>Sarn says:</p><p>I find this use of nested parenthesis very hard to get my head around, and<br/>it makes my eyes water.</p><p>What I would appreciate, and you might want to do for me Paul, is to place<br/>this as an extended fraction, and give me an in depth description of how you<br/>came up with this.</p><p>The reason I am intrigued by extended fraction, is because I chanced upon<br/>one that generated the golden proportion as its convergence, and in addition<br/>to this, I found that it converged IDENTICALLY, and at the same rate as the<br/>Fibonacci series!!!</p><p>I have seen other expressions that generate phi, one with nested square<br/>roots of one added to the square root of one added to the square root of one.</p><p>Also:</p><p>5^0.5*0.5+0.5 gives phi, and also:</p><p>2*cos(pi/5) radians give phi.</p><p>I fiddeled with my own extended fractions, and found what I feel is one that<br/>gives the Tribonacci ratio, but the extended fraction above is surely<br/>something new.</p><p>More information?</p><p>--Sarn.</p></div>
