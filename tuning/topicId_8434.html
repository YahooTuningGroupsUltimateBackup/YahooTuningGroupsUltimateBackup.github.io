The latest<br/>installments were Jerry Eskelin in TD 524.9, Dave Keenan<br/>in TD 525.12, and the following:</p><p>&gt; [Bob Valentine, TD 525.22]<br/>&gt; I see the point that B up to F should be termed a diminished<br/>&gt; fifth and that F up to B should be termed an augmented fourth<br/>&gt; if ones terms are going to match the traditional diatonic scale.<br/>&gt; However, for F over B to be a 7/5 and B over F a 10/7, implies<br/>&gt; the belief that the fourth should always be flattened as part<br/>&gt; of a cadence. Perhaps that is what singers do, although I&apos;d<br/>&gt; like to see some numerical data to back that. Without that<br/>&gt; assumption I would suspect that the diminished fifth is 64/45<br/>&gt; and the augmented fourth 45/32, which are very close to the<br/>&gt; exact opposite view!</p><p>I offer this explanation.</p><p>The terminology (in words) derives from &apos;common-practice&apos; theory,<br/>which was/is based on a diatonic scale in meantone tuning which<br/>represents 5-limit JI.</p><p>Here is a lattice for the &apos;major scale&apos; that is the<br/>&apos;standard&apos; paradigm for 5-limit &apos;common-practice&apos; theory:</p><p>    A --- E --- B<br/>   5/3   5/4   15/8<br/>   / \   / \   / \<br/>  /   \ /   \ /   \<br/> F --- C --- G --- D<br/>4/3   1/1   3/2   9/8</p><p>The &apos;dominant 7th&apos; chord in this context, which most of us<br/>would agree stems from the pitches available here, would<br/>be formed as follows:</p><p>&apos;7th&apos;   4/3<br/>&apos;5th&apos;   9/8<br/>&apos;3rd&apos;  15/8<br/>&apos;root&apos;  3/2</p><p>giving the proportions 36:45:54:64.

Clearly this is an<br/>example of what you are talking about. There had to be a way to sidestep<br/>this problem on Renaissance and Baroque (and later!) keyboard instruments<br/>(necessarily of fixed pitch); the solution was meantone temperament.<br/>Unfortunately for Jerry, meantone temperament has very dissonant dominant<br/>seventh chord. During the meantone period, a keyboard continuo was quite<br/>common and it is doubtful that many vocalists would have made the ~35-cent<br/>change necessary to make 4:5:6:7 dominant seventh chords. But I guess we&apos;ll<br/>never know for sure.</p><p>&gt;Interest in allowing<br/>&gt;for &quot;scale step&quot; deviations to accommodate root changes seems minimal, and<br/>&gt;appears to result in compromised intervals having high-number ratios.</p><p>The type of theory you&apos;re describing here is one that I&apos;ve always lashed out<br/>against. You&apos;ll find a lot of theorists doing that sort of thing, including<br/>Yasser of all people, but those high-number ratios are almost always<br/>irrelevant. The adaptive tuning algorithms John deLaubenfels has been<br/>implementing and I and others have been discussing aim to tune almost all<br/>simultaneities in simple-integer ratios; each &quot;scale step&quot; will fluctuate<br/>over the course of the piece, though John&apos;s program tries to keep sudden,<br/>drastic changes (which would be disturbing in performance) to a minimum.<br/>Meanwhile, John Link and others seems to like sudden, drastic changes,<br/>particularly in scale step 2 in the major scale, but in my opinion they&apos;re<br/>clinging too strongly to an essentially fixed-pitch interpretation like the<br/>one Monz gave (augmented with an additional &quot;D&quot; at 10/9 to make a consonant<br/>D minor triad).</p><p>&gt;&gt; If the notes appear in a different position, with the &apos;B&apos;<br/>&gt;&gt; above the &apos;F&apos;, then the chord contains an &apos;augmented 4th&apos;<br/>&gt;&gt; (which is synonymous with &apos;tritone&apos;), with the ratio 32:45.</p><p>&gt;To me, the functional &quot;augmented fourth&quot; in a dominant 7th chord is _not<br/>&gt;synonymous with &quot;tritone.&quot; The former is larger and specifically has the<br/>&gt;leading tone on top and the latter is the keyboard&apos;s compromised ambiguous<br/>&gt;version of both &quot;inversions.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Tritone&quot; literally means three tones, or three major seconds, or an<br/>augmented fourth.</p><p>&gt;&gt; This is defined on the same page by Ellis as 3^2 * 5^1,<br/>&gt;&gt; and has a size of ~590 cents.  The septimal version, 5:7,<br/>&gt;&gt; is quite close at ~583 cents and is called by Ellis the<br/>&gt;&gt; &apos;septimal or subminor Fifth&apos;,...</p><p>&gt;Why not 600 cents? Aren&apos;t we talking keyboard here?</p><p>Ellis was one of the &quot;high-number ratio&quot; people we both take issue with. His<br/>590 cents is the 45:32. For practical purposes, the keyboard tuning would<br/>indeed be relevant -- as it happens, one variety of meantone, 1/6-comma<br/>meantone, has exactly this 590-cent augmented fourth.</p><p>&gt;In any case, is 7 cents<br/>&gt;considered &quot;quite close&quot;? The difference between a keyboard &quot;tritone&quot; and<br/>an<br/>&gt;acoustic 5:7 diminished fifth or 7:10 augmented fourth is aurally quite<br/>&gt;considerable.</p><p>There are meantone tunings, though, where the augmented fourth would<br/>coincide with Jerry&apos;s &quot;diminished fifth&quot;; namely, 583 cents. Most of the<br/>historical meantone tunings come closer to this than 1/6-comma meantone.</p><p>&gt;Sounds like a whopping difference. I&apos;ll go with the one that best describes<br/>&gt;what ears hear. It appears to me that the 5-limit concept is simply a<br/>&gt;compromised apology to 12-tET tradition.</p><p>The 5-limit concept is much older than 12-tET tradition. The 5-limit<br/>concept, combined with the consensus ears of musicians, brought about the<br/>adoption of meantone tuning in the late 15th century. The dominant seventh<br/>chord was born in this 5-limit, meantone environment. In that environment,<br/>it was the augmented sixth chord, not the dominant seventh chord, that<br/>approximated the 4:5:6:7 chord. In fact, if you look at the historical<br/>literature, you&apos;ll find people discussing ratios of 7 in the context of<br/>augmented sixth chords and on their own merits long before ratios of 7 were<br/>ever discussed in the context of dominant seventh chords. And this wasn&apos;t<br/>the result of any over-abstract theory -- Tartini could play the ratios of 7<br/>on his violin (we know because he reported hearing the then-unknown<br/>difference tones in the correct places) and yet considered these ratios to<br/>be foreign (in a good way!) to diatonic music rather than part of an<br/>already-existing practice involving dominant seventh chords.</p></div><h3><a id=8465 href="#8465">ðŸ”—</a>John Link &#x3C;johnlink@con2.com&#x3E;</h3><span>2/11/2000 5:16:49 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>&gt;From: &quot;Paul H.

(During<br/>most of the 1900s, I would say that &apos;12-EDO thinking&apos; monopolized<br/>most trained musicians&apos;s view of things.  I know for sure that<br/>in my own very extensive musical schooling I never learned one<br/>thing about ratios.  It&apos;s all been a result of personal study<br/>inspired by Partch&apos;s book.)</p><p>You are certainly correct to note that at all times in history<br/>and in all places, music was and is conceived and performed<br/>by people who have no conscious training or mathematical<br/>awareness of their intonation - and sometimes it is very good!.</p><p>&gt; [Jerry]<br/>&gt; I&quot;m beginning to suspect that this &quot;problem&quot; is grounded in<br/>&gt; theorists (and perhaps microtonalists, as well) intent on<br/>&gt; providing a rational system of fixed pitches that relate<br/>&gt; directly to a tonal center.</p><p>I&apos;ll say that the grain of truth in what you say is this:<br/>that theorists often assume that a musical performance makes<br/>use of a set of pitches which is far smaller and less<br/>sophisticated than the one actually being used.</p><p>Partly (perhaps mainly) this is a result of cultural conditioning.<br/>Very often, if you&apos;re not aware of some kind of subtlety in<br/>music you&apos;re listening to, it will be very subtle indeed: you<br/>won&apos;t notice it at all.</p><p>About 12 years ago, I stunned myself one night because I had<br/>been partying late, and the radio played _All My Loving_ by<br/>the Beatles.  A huge Beatle fan in my teens and 20s, I&apos;d heard<br/>the tune probably thousands of times and knew it by heart...<br/>I thought.  Well, this time I was listening so closely that<br/>I noticed something I&apos;d never heard before: on the last verse<br/>(after the guitar solo), when Paul &amp; John sing &apos;miss you&apos;, Paul<br/>plays two wrong notes on his bass.  I was so stoned that even<br/>with my extremely minimal knowledge of bass-guitar technique I<br/>figured out what he did wrong: he played those two notes on the<br/>next higher string.</p><p>Point is: no matter how familiar you think something is, a<br/>true masterpiece of a performance has so much packed into it<br/>that you hear something new every time if you really pay<br/>attention.  And a *lot* of this subtlety in good musicians<br/>has to do with variations in pitch  ...and apparently, some<br/>of it is unintentional!  :)</p><p>&gt; [Jerry]<br/>&gt; Interest in allowing for &quot;scale step&quot; deviations to<br/>&gt; accommodate root changes seems minimal, and appears to<br/>&gt; result in compromised intervals having high-number ratios.<br/>&gt; Help me on this, Monz. Is there any truth to that? Or am<br/>&gt; I out on a shaky and naive limb here?</p><p>The kind of deviations you&apos;re talking about here do indeed<br/>involve high-number ratios, but as I like to point out on<br/>a lattice diagram, the relationships may actually be much<br/>simpler than they would appear (by looking only at the numbers).</p><p>I&apos;ve become very interested in what I call &apos;cross-exponent&apos;<br/>connections, where the tuning of a note in a blues performance<br/>suggests a ratio which is several rungs away from the chord-root<br/>on the lattice, often in several different prime-dimensions.<br/>But functionally, the notes are acting as valid chord-members,<br/>as if they had a direct connection with (i.e., vector to) the<br/>&apos;root&apos; (in the way, for instance, that 5/4, 3/2, and 7/4 all<br/>have a direct connection to 1/1).  One interesting example is<br/>the 80:99 &apos;low 3rd&apos;, which is ~369 cents and functions as a<br/>&apos;3rd&apos; in the chord.  The most relevant work I&apos;ve done on this<br/>is the old post I just referenced yesterday:<br/><a href="http://www.onelist.com/messages/tuning?archive=132">http://www.onelist.com/messages/tuning?archive=132</a><br/>TD 132.2, an analysis of an Etta James MIDI-file.</p><p>On the contrary to what you say, it seems from my reading<br/>of these Digests every day that interest in *lots* of<br/>different aspects of tuning theory is very high, and<br/>increasing all the time.  Quite a few subscribers here<br/>have posted much interesting information on &apos;deviations<br/>to accommodate root changes&apos; - unless I&apos;m really missing<br/>something about all the discussion surrounding John<br/>deLaubenfels&apos;s work.</p><p>&gt; [me, monz]<br/>&gt; If the notes appear in a different position, with the &apos;B&apos;<br/>&gt; above the &apos;F&apos;, then the chord contains an &apos;augmented 4th&apos;<br/>&gt; (which is synonymous with &apos;tritone&apos;), with the ratio 32:45.</p><p>&gt; [Jerry]<br/>&gt; To me, the functional &quot;augmented fourth&quot; in a dominant 7th<br/>&gt; chord is _not synonymous with &quot;tritone.&quot; The former is larger<br/>&gt; and specifically has the leading tone on top and the latter<br/>&gt; is the keyboard&apos;s compromised ambiguous version of both<br/>&gt; &quot;inversions.&quot;</p><p>You are entirely correct to point out that &apos;tritone&apos; has<br/>this meaning.  My dictionary still lacks an entry for this<br/>important term, and I see right away that there are at least<br/>2 distinct definitions.</p><p>One is yours: the tritone does indeed specify the &apos;compromised<br/>ambiguous version&apos;, 2^(6/12) = 600 cents = exactly 1/2-&apos;octave&apos;.</p><p>But the original meaning, which is obvious from the word&apos;s<br/>etymology, is to define an interval composed of *3 tones*.<br/>The term developed at a time which stipulated a Pythagorean<br/>context (help me on the history, Margo), and so thus the<br/>interval was (9/8)^3 = 512:729 = ~611.73 cents.  This is<br/>exactly synonymous with &apos;augmented 4th&apos; in Pythagorean tuning.</p><p>Of course, &apos;tritone&apos; has also been put into service to<br/>mean the 5-limit varieties I discussed in my post, as well<br/>as a myriad of other rational and irrational pitches.<br/>In fact, it is probably the most malleable of all the<br/>interval categories.  Barlow too noticed this, and that&apos;s<br/>why he chose precisely this interval to illustrate in his<br/>paper.</p><p>&gt; [me, monz]<br/>&gt; This is defined on the same page by Ellis as 3^2 * 5^1,<br/>&gt; and has a size of ~590 cents.  The septimal version, 5:7,<br/>&gt; is quite close at ~583 cents and is called by Ellis the<br/>&gt; &apos;septimal or subminor Fifth&apos;,...</p><p>&gt; [Jerry]<br/>&gt; Why not 600 cents? Aren&apos;t we talking keyboard here?</p><p>Partch complained a lot (in 1949) that keyboards had forced<br/>12-tET onto everyone and everything, but today that&apos;s no<br/>longer true.  Lots of synthesizers are microtunable, and lots<br/>of people experiment with &apos;alternate tunings&apos;.  So I wouldn&apos;t<br/>equate the two anymore.</p><p>And to answer your question: No.  *I* wasn&apos;t &apos;talking keyboard<br/>here&apos;! - or more precisely, I wasn&apos;t talking 12-EDO/tET here.<br/>My lattice explictly portrayed 5-limit JI!</p><p>I assumed that we all knew the lovable old 600-cent tritone,<br/>and were looking for alternate rational interpretations.</p><p>I was just trying to provide a backdrop that was based<br/>on *theoretical* tunings for say the last 500 years or so.<br/>Of course in practice this was translated into meantone<br/>until about 1850 and into 12-EDO since then (until recently  ;-).<br/>But until the total dominance of 12-EDO in Euro-centric<br/>theory around 1900, the 5-limit JI paradigm usually played<br/>at last a small part in concepts concerning harmony/tonality.</p><p>&gt; [Jerry]<br/>&gt; In any case, is 7 cents considered &quot;quite close&quot;?</p><p>Well, Fokker considered the 224:225 [= ~7.7 cents] to be<br/>&apos;imperceptible&apos;, and used it in his 1949 book as what I would<br/>call a &apos;5==7 xenharmonic bridge&apos;, that is, a small interval<br/>that related a pitch that listeners familiar with 5-limit<br/>practice would know, with the 7th harmonic, so that singers<br/>could &apos;hear&apos; the &apos;new&apos; musical element.</p><p>I disagree with Fokker, and indeed have chosen (in _3 Plus 4_)<br/>one pitch over another that were separated by exactly this<br/>interval, because to my ears they made a big difference in the<br/>harmony, and I preferred the 5-limit version, while the 7-limit<br/>one (which my non-absolute-pitch mind thought it wanted) sounded<br/>totally out-of-tune.</p><p>But in any case, by this difference of opinion, it seemed<br/>to me that it was OK to characterize two intervals separated<br/>by this distance as &apos;quite close&apos;.  (BTW, since the naming game<br/>is going on, this category is a &apos;kleisma&apos;.)</p><p>&gt; [Jerry]<br/>&gt; The difference between a keyboard &quot;tritone&quot; and an acoustic<br/>&gt; 5:7 diminished fifth or 7:10 augmented fourth is aurally quite<br/>&gt; considerable.</p><p>2^(6/12) / (7/5)  or   (10/7) / 2^(6/12) = ~17.48 cents.</p><p>That&apos;s quite a bit greater - and *usually* *much* more<br/>perceptible - than 7 cents.  But again, *context can play<br/>tricks on you!!!*.  In the very piece I was talking about<br/>above, I *heard* a much larger difference between 75/64<br/>and 7/6 [= the ~7.7 cent &apos;bridge&apos; discussed above] than I<br/>did between 19/16 and 75/64 [= ~22.93 cents].</p><p>&gt; [Jerry]<br/>&gt; I&apos;ll go with the one that best describes what ears hear.</p><p>Hah!  - What do you think it is that we Tuning List addicts<br/>try to thrash out day after day?!  No-one is quite sure<br/>exactly what &apos;ears&apos; hear, and indeed, it&apos;s certain that<br/>everyone hears a little differently.  Let me know when<br/>you figure it out.   ;-)</p><p>&gt; [Jerry]<br/>&gt; It appears to me that the 5-limit concept is simply a<br/>&gt; compromised apology to 12-tET tradition.</p><p>HARDLY !!!!  The 5-limit concept far preceded the &apos;12-tET<br/>tradition&apos;.  That &apos;tradition&apos; is really only a product of the<br/>last century!  At most, it goes back to the Renaissance lutenists.</p><p>The 5-limit concept is at least as old, perhaps stretching<br/>all the way back to ancient Greece.  I have written/will<br/>eventually write a few papers speculating on the use of<br/>5-limit tuning with the Franks, Romans, and Greeks, but most<br/>theorists accept it as beginning in earnest around 1430.</p><p>At any rate, various meantones &apos;won out&apos; first as a popular<br/>fixed tuning which implied 5-limit JI.  Well-temperaments<br/>came later, *then* 12-tET carried the day (for a while).</p><p>&gt; [Jerry]<br/>&gt; Does the mincrotonalist&apos;s term &quot;comma&quot; relate to my question<br/>&gt; above regarding high-number compromises?</p><p>Well, yes...  Take a look at the various entries in my Dictionary.</p><p>The desideratum is usually to have various commas &apos;vanish&apos;,<br/>so that pitches that would be a comma apart are both represented<br/>by a single pitch, generally to prevent &apos;commatic drift&apos;.</p><p>The pitch chosen need not be a &apos;high-number compromise&apos;.  In<br/>many musical styles, particularly folk-music, the performer<br/>simply chooses (or is forced by his instrument to choose) one<br/>of the tones and uses it all the time, in which case it will<br/>be a comma &apos;off&apos; when the other pitch is the one that &apos;belongs&apos;<br/>in the harmony or melody.</p><p>Or, as in meantone, the pitch chosen is not a ratio at all,<br/>but rather an irrational division of the syntonic comma.<br/>For example, in &apos;1/4-comma meantone&apos;, that 1/4-comma is<br/>calculated as (9/8)^(1/4), or &apos;the 4th root of 9/8&apos;.<br/>This results in a number which has a non-repeating decimal<br/>part, and which thus cannot be considered an integer ratio,<br/>no matter how high the terms are multiplied.  Of course,<br/>at some point the ear/brain system fails to distinguish<br/>a difference, but these limits of perception are another<br/>thing no-one is sure of.</p><p>Anyway, I think the most important point you made was that<br/>of the variability of tuning, especially among untrained<br/>performers.</p><p>-monz</p><p>Joseph L.

These apply whether we are talking about fixed tuning or adaptive tuning (e.g. by singers).</p><p>I earlier only gave one of them which is that the chord contains two stacked (approximate) minor thirds 5:6|5:6. This would make the dim 5th 25:36 (631 c).</p><p>The other, and probably more important &quot;pull&quot;, mentioned by Paul E. (and Mark Nowitzky in his web page) is that there is a very important note in the scale, but not in the chord, that needs to be an approximate 3:4 below the high note and an approximate 3:4 above the low note (of the dim 7th chord). Of course that important note is the tonic. This relationship is required to prevent tonic drift in the common-as-dirt I IV V7 I chord progression, with notes sustained between chords. e.g.</p><p>    F---F<br/>E   |       E<br/>    |   D<br/>C---C       C<br/>        B   |<br/>    A       |<br/>G       G---G</p><p>That implies that G:F is 9:16, and assuming we also want G:B to be 4:5, we get a size of 45:64 (610 c) for the B:F dim 5th.</p><p>In 5-limit JI the D:F minor third is broken anyway and so we go with the latter result. In meantone we compromise between the two. And I expect singers make a similar compromise, even when singing a cappella (except for the very distinctive &quot;barbershop&quot; style).</p><p>Diminished fifth candidates:</p><p>Ratio  Cents   Description<br/>----------------------------------------<br/>25:36  631.3   1/3-comma meantone (Just minor thirds 5:6)<br/>       620.5   1/4-comma meantone (Just major thirds 4:5)<br/>7:10   617.5<br/>       614.1   1/5-comma meantone<br/>45:64  609.8   5-limit JI  (Just fourths 3:4 and major thirds 4:5)<br/>       600.0   12-tET</p><p>       588.3   Pythagorean (Just fourths 3:4)<br/>5:7    582.5   Barbershop (extreme dynamic tuning)</p><p>So if we want a low numbered (or 7 limit) ratio to represent the diminished fifth, 7:10 is way more representative of common diatonic practice for the last 400 years.</p><p>If you want to teach your singers to sing barbershop style, that&apos;s fine. In that case your diminished fifths _will_ be 5:7. But don&apos;t kid yourself that this is the &quot;natural&quot; size for a dim 5th. They must somehow hide the not inconsiderable difference between the 9:16 and the 4:7 (27.3 cents). With the above progression, I think that the best they can do is to gliss the C and F down by 9.1 cents and the G up by 9.1 cents.</p><p>Of course a V7 ii progression would present a _much_ harder problem. That of hiding the difference between a 6:7 and a 5:6 (48.8 c) in just one move. Best case would be to gliss the F up by 24.4 cents and the D down by 24.4 cents.

Singers are more likely to sense the perfect-fifth root of<br/>the V7 in relation to the remembered tonic pitch than to adjust the G, B,<br/>and D to a firmly repeated F. As soon as the chord changes to V, the F<br/>becomes less stable and finds &quot;security&quot; in relation to the root G. All of<br/>this returns with no big problem to the same C on which the first tonic<br/>chord was based.</p><p>Apparently, your conclusion that singers would sing a dominant seventh chord<br/>with a 5:6 third from fifth to seventh is a result of your need to minimize<br/>&quot;drift.&quot; Believe me, drift does not occur when singers tune the dominant<br/>seventh chord as 4:5:6:7. The &quot;adjustment&quot; occurs melodically in the<br/>&quot;less-than-half-step&quot; resolution of the chord seventh.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; That implies that G:F is 9:16, and assuming we also want G:B to be 4:5, we<br/>&gt; get a size of 45:64 (610 c) for the B:F dim 5th.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; In 5-limit JI the D:F minor third is broken anyway and so we go with the<br/>&gt; latter result. In meantone we compromise between the two. And I expect<br/>&gt; singers make a similar compromise, even when singing a cappella (except for<br/>&gt; the very distinctive &quot;barbershop&quot; style).</p><p>Why the distinction? Classical singers can achieve wonderfully expressive<br/>results when sensitive to acoustic tuning.
