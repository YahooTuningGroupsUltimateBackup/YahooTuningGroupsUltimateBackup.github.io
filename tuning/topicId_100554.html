But in theory, the interval in question could be called like that as well. Let&apos;s put it straight in the 5-limit  so that you could understand my point:<br/>If you have a step of ~443 cents, then two of them make a nice major sixth (that&apos;s why &quot;semisixth&quot;). But also (and this is an the goal in 5-limit semisixth tempering) 7 of them make a very good fifth plus 2 octaves, and 9 of them make a very good major third plus 3 octaves. This particular temperament is called &quot;semisixth&quot; or &quot;semisixths&quot; (or &quot;sensipent&quot;) and is understood to have a one-octave period in most cases. In my version, I used a two-octave period, which offers more harmonic possibilities with less tones and also gives me a MOS within the entire interval sequence leading to the comma pump.</p><p>Semitenth is rather a piece of my modified terminology, not a well-known term which I would have read somewhere out there. If you have a step of ~757 cents, then two of them make a nice minor tenth (that&apos;s why semitenth). Although the tempering is just the opposite of semisixth (i.e. using -7 and -9 generators for the desired approximations), I called it &quot;semitenth&quot; because a two-octave period makes it a different scale.</p><p>If you use Scala, you can load the first scale and type &quot;show location 2:3:5&quot; or load the second scale and type &quot;show location 3:4:5&quot;. This should tell you which scale degrees approximate the target chords.</p><p>Hope this helps.</p><p>Petr</p></div><h3><a id=100724 href="#100724">ðŸ”—</a>Chris Vaisvil &#x3C;chrisvaisvil@...&#x3E;</h3><span>7/11/2011 2:07:01 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Thanks for the explanation of semisixth, etc. Petr.</p><p>I used pianoteq - that is pretty much my default unless I have my guitar<br/>synth out.</p><p>On Mon, Jul 11, 2011 at 11:21 AM, Petr Par&iacute;zek &lt;petrparizek2000@...&gt;wrote:</p><p>&gt; **<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Chris wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; I used my 88 key fake piano mid controller.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; What synth or WS are you controlling with that?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; I did try quite a number of<br/>&gt; &gt; chords.
