The 7th partial is a rather weak one to<br/>start with, but I don&apos;t hear it appearing when the action is moved in or out<br/>from its normal position.<br/>   It is also worth noting that the contact point of the hammer is usually<br/>wider than on node&apos;s worth, so it is actually covering several &quot;nodes&quot;.  It<br/>doesn&apos;t cancel all of them.<br/>REgards,<br/>Ed Foote RPT<br/>Nashville, Tn.</p></div><h3><a id=31299 href="#31299">ðŸ”—</a>jpehrson2 &#x3C;jpehrson@rcn.com&#x3E;</h3><span>12/10/2001 7:18:38 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In tuning@y..., a440a@a... wrote:</p><p><a href="/tuning/topicId_31247.html#31247">/tuning/topicId_31247.html#31247</a></p><p>&gt; &lt;&lt;&quot;If the string is plucked or struck at a node of a mode, then the<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; corresponding overtone will not be present in the sound.
