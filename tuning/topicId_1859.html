Here&apos;s what he (Dan Wolf) said:<br/>&gt;&gt;I made a series of WAV files with sawtooth waveforms and a smooth envelope<br/>&gt;&gt;in the following series of intervals, with the lower tone set to 200, 300<br/>&gt;&gt;and 400 Hz:</p><p>So I take it he repeated the whole experiment 3 times.</p><p>&gt;If so, then all of the fractions can (and should) be converted to share the<br/>&gt;same denominator.  In which case dissonance, if it is proportional to d,<br/>&gt;doesn&apos;t change across the entire experiment.</p><p>Nah. Why? His whole point was that the dissonance was proportional to d<br/>WHEN THE FRACTION IS IN LOWEST TERMS. This is also true for n+d.</p><p>&gt;&gt;This implies that lower frequencies are inherently more dissonant than<br/>&gt;&gt;higher ones.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;How so?  What does frequency have to do with anything, other than what<br/>&gt;Sethares discussed with the sensory dissonance model?</p><p>Maybe it does correspond to Sethares. Notice how we typically play only<br/>octaves and fifths in the bass. The others are too dissonant down there.<br/>What we are suggesting here is that the dissonance is related to the period<br/>(inverse of frequency) of the virtual fundamental (VF). When the ratio for<br/>an interval is in lowest terms, the VF corresponds to a 1.</p><p>e.g. If the lower tone is fixed at 400Hz the VF of a 6:4 (= 3:2) is 200Hz<br/>(period 5ms) while the VF of a 5:4 is 100Hz (period 10ms). Periods are<br/>proportional to d.</p><p>If instead we fix the average frequency of the two notes at 450Hz. The<br/>notes of a 3:2 will be 360Hz and 540Hz and the VF will be 180Hz (period<br/>5.56ms), while the notes of a 5:4 will be 400Hz and 500Hz and the VF will<br/>be 100Hz (period 10ms). Periods are proportional to n+d or (n+d)/2.</p><p>If we want to talk about the realtive dissonance of intervals (or chords<br/>for that metter) without considering frequency, then the only sensible<br/>thing to do is to compare them all with the same average frequency, hence<br/>n+d or (n+d)/2 is the right approximation for dyads, not d.</p><p>Regards,<br/>-- Dave Keenan<br/><a href="http://dkeenan.com">http://dkeenan.com</a></p></div><h3><a id=1892 href="#1892">ðŸ”—</a>D.
