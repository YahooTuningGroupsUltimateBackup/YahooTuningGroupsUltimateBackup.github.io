I&apos;m debating how widely to<br/>share the paper at this point as I await some feedback from some of the folks I&apos;ve already sent it to. It&apos;s in a final-draft state, complete and well-edited, and I&apos;ve got accompanying audio along with the paper&apos;s illustrations and more.<br/>But there is still room for potential revision so I&apos;m hoping to get some feedback before fully publishing it to the wider public.</p><p>Essentially I wrapped up all my understanding of barbershop tuning into this 82-page (double-spaced, including illustrations) paper based on a score analysis along with multiple sample audio files, with emphasis on presenting perceptual and practical issues for potential future empirical studies.</p><p>I will probably make some minor improvements as I hear feedback, but the current draft is pretty finalized, possibly truly final.<br/>Anyone interested in reading it at this point, contact me and I&apos;ll send you the link!</p><p>In harmony,<br/>Aaron Wolf</p></div><h3><a id=91692 href="#91692">ðŸ”—</a>quadrangle &#x3C;wolftune@...&#x3E;</h3><span>8/11/2010 2:51:37 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Two quick addendum comments:</p><p>1. oops, misspelling in title.</p><p>2. I intentionally wrote this treatise with a broad viewpoint. I use barbershop as the medium by which to discuss the nature of just intonation and pitch perception generally. My explicit intent is to have a paper of value to all musicians doing anything harmonic.</p><p>Cheers,<br/>Aaron</p><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;quadrangle&quot; &lt;wolftune@...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Hi everyone.
