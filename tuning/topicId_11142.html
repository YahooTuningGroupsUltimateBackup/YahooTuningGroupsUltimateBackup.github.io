It creates a java applet that<br/>streams audio. I have my first working<br/>copy at: <a href="http://www.virtulink.com/immp/video">http://www.virtulink.com/immp/video</a><br/>Scroll down to Land of Vibration and check it<br/>out. Does it stream properly? Does it make your<br/>machine or browser hang up and crash?</p><p>There&apos;s also some new Shri Swifty videos<br/>that I put up recently.</p><p>--<br/>* D a v i d         B e a r d s l e y<br/>*           <a href="mailto:xouoxno@virtulink.com">xouoxno@virtulink.com</a><br/>*<br/>* 49/32  R a d i o &quot;all microtonal, all the time&quot;<br/>* M E L A  v i r t u a l  d r e a m house monitor<br/>*<br/>* <a href="http://www.virtulink.com/immp/lookhere.htm">http://www.virtulink.com/immp/lookhere.htm</a></p></div><h3><a id=11164 href="#11164">ðŸ”—</a>Jonathan M.

If you&apos;re using Netscape,<br/>&gt;you should see the progress of the download<br/>&gt;at the bottom of the screen.</p><p>As you noted in later posts (I&apos;m digested), it varies widely in implementation on the different platform/browsers. Not to mention that the basic Java support itself varies in differing setups. This, coupled with the fact that you say the entire wave must be held in memory (did I grok that correctly?), would make this a very dubious choice for an inline/streaming tool. And, yes, it does take a while for the buttons to show up, which means that most surfers, not seeing anything but plain HTML links on the page, wouldn&apos;t have known anything about it.</p><p>With the quality that clunky (saving space because of the applet implementation), other ways seems a better way to go (then again, you did say it was an experiment).</p><p>&gt;This is begining to remind me of working with<br/>&gt;a customer or maybe my 73 year old father.</p><p>Hey, easy. Don&apos;t diss the public until you are sure the technology isn&apos;t at fault (or, at least, isn&apos;t slam-dunk intuitive!). And this coming from someone who *likes* to do Java programming when time allows...</p><p>&gt;Did anybody else check this out?</p><p>Me. BTW, since Joseph P. has also been banging his head on the streaming music wall, how about another facet to the whole thing: I&apos;ve been reading posts on a webdesign list on a couple of sites using Shockwave to steam the audio. Why? Because there is almost no wait (it streams almost instantaneously) and anyone with the plugin gets it. The encoding, which I did not see discussed, sounds at least like better .mp3 encoding (128 bit or so). If it is of interest I&apos;ll try and find some of the commentaries/sites.</p><p>OK, enough beta testing...  :)</p><p>Cheers,<br/>Jon<br/>&grave;&apos;&grave;&apos;&grave;&apos;&grave;&apos;&grave;&apos;&grave;&apos;&grave;&apos;&grave;&apos;&grave;&apos;&grave;&apos;&grave;&apos;&grave;&apos;&grave;&apos;&grave;&apos;&grave;&apos;&grave;&apos;&grave;&apos;&grave;&apos;&grave;&apos;&grave;&apos;&grave;&apos;&grave;&apos;&grave;&apos;&grave;&apos;&grave;&apos;&grave;<br/>Real Life: Orchestral Percussionist<br/>Web Life: &quot;Corporeal Meadows&quot; - about Harry Partch<br/>                         <a href="http://www.corporeal.com/">http://www.corporeal.com/</a></p></div>
