Often when listening to someone of the caliber of Kudsi Erguner, i notice &quot;modulations&quot;<br/>or brief borrowings, or other scales temporarily to such a point i associate it with this music,<br/>This also seems to complicate the reducing of the music to a single scale,</p><p>&gt;<br/>&gt;    From: &quot;ertugrulInanc&quot; &lt;<a href="mailto:ertugrulinanc@yahoo.com">ertugrulinanc@yahoo.com</a>&gt;<br/>&gt; Subject: Re: 7-limit &iuml;&iquest;&half; la Turk<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Just for the record, there has never been a 53-equal Turkish<br/>&gt; temperment.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; All of the above mentioned authors explain the tone system as a non-<br/>&gt; equal division of octave into 17 pitches (or pitch areas).<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; In the late XIX. and early XX. century, christian/arabic theorist<br/>&gt; Mikhail Meshaqa of Lebanon (which was a Turkish terrain) influenced<br/>&gt; the eastern music world with his 24-unequal division. His system is<br/>&gt; officially taught in Arabic countries and Iran today. Turkish<br/>&gt; musicologist Rauf Yekt&iuml;&iquest;&half; Bey also adopted his system with minor<br/>&gt; changes to make it fit the Turkish practice and declared his 24-<br/>&gt; unequal division. This sytem was modified by H.S. Arel and his<br/>&gt; companion Dr. S. Ezgi, gradually becoming the standard system in<br/>&gt; teaching.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; ?efik G&iuml;&iquest;&half;rmeri&iuml;&iquest;&half;, pupil of Arel, started the &quot;tradition&quot; of explaining<br/>&gt; the system as a whole tone divided into 9 &apos;commas&apos;, hence octave<br/>&gt; divided into 53 as a practical approach. Neither Yekt&iuml;&iquest;&half;, nor Arel-Ezgi<br/>&gt; ever stated a 53-equal system.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Aside from those, Ekrem Karadeniz, pupil of great composer<br/>&gt; Abdulkaadir T&iuml;&iquest;&half;re, formed his own 41-tone system identical to Partch&apos;s<br/>&gt; 43.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Again for the record, all of the above mentioned systems, except for<br/>&gt; the classical 17 division, have failed explaining the ongoing Turkish<br/>&gt; music practice. Especially the Arel-Ezgi system with its false<br/>&gt; intervals and scales have never accorded with the performance and<br/>&gt; tradition.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Regards,<br/>&gt; Ertugrul</p><p>-- Kraig Grady<br/>North American Embassy of Anaphoria island<br/> <a href="http://www.anaphoria.com">http://www.anaphoria.com</a></p><p>The Wandering Medicine Show<br/>Wed. 8-9 KXLU 88.9 fm</p></div>
