The accuracy is far less than with harmonic intervals, at<br/>&gt;least because the roughness mechanism is not involved (so melodies produced<br/>&gt;on a tempered instrument will sound okay).</p><p>And in fact, for ratios of 5 or higher, the accuracy with which ratios of<br/>_melodic_ intervals are reckoned is so low that factors of &quot;custom&quot; or<br/>&quot;familiarity&quot; are far more important than the harmonic series. Furthermore,<br/>if your first sentence above is true, why are minor arpeggios at least as<br/>common as major arpeggios in non-harmonized music from around the world (at<br/>least what I&apos;ve heard)?</p><p>&gt;I reject the idea that<br/>&gt;only ratios of 3 are important in melodic tuning.  Often, the desire to<br/>&gt;simplify the DM makes the global scale definable in terms of a single just<br/>&gt;interval, and this interval has historically been the 3/2, because 3/2 is<br/>&gt;such a strong consonance.  But chains of any strong consonance could work,</p><p>Speaking again strictly of melodic tuning, I fail to see any evidence of<br/>that.</p><p>&gt;Let&apos;s not forget Wyschnegradsky, Carillo, Haba, Mandelbaum, Blackwood, or<br/>&gt;Haverstick!</p><p>Surprisingly similar to what I just posted:</p><p>&gt;In this century alone, we<br/>&gt;have counterexamples in Wychnegradsky, Haba, Carillo, Ives, Stockhausen,<br/>&gt;Xenakis, Badings, Darreg, Blackwood, Maneri, Penderecki, Carlos, and<br/>&gt;Reinhard.</p><p>Kraig Grady wrote,</p><p>&gt;Despite the worth of [those composers], they are not as well known!</p><p>Kraig, that may be true on the West Coast, but here on the East Coast,<br/>things are quite different. For example, when I submitted my proposal for a<br/>microtonal independent study course to the chair of the music department at<br/>Yale, the only microtonal composer she had ever heard of was Wyschnegradsky!</p></div><h3>Paul H.

And what are the driving forces behind custom,<br/>&gt;then?</p><p>I don&apos;t know; join the sociology list.</p><p>&gt;I&apos;d call +/-10 cents a fair estimate of the accuracy of singing the<br/>&gt;&quot;base-two under&quot; 7-limit melodic intervals, which is closer than 19-tone<br/>&gt;equal temperament.</p><p>Come again?</p><p>&gt;Far greater accuracy is possible when a drone is present.</p><p>Absolutely.</p><p>&gt;Granted, these<br/>&gt;would be &quot;harmonic&quot; intervals by our current convention,</p><p>Yup.</p><p>&gt;but... clearly a<br/>&gt;melody over a drone is still a melody in some important ways (otherwise we<br/>&gt;would not find approximations to the linear series in Indian and Persian<br/>&gt;melodies).</p><p>Right . . . except I&apos;d replace &quot;the linear series&quot; with &quot;diatonic<br/>structures&quot; -- usually altered ones.</p><p>&gt;[Reference Bobby McFerrin&apos;s &quot;The Voice&quot;]</p><p>That&apos;s a great album -- which track are you thinking of?</p><p>&gt;You&apos;re assuming they approximate a utonal structure?  Stuff I&apos;ve heard is<br/>&gt;usually closer to 7/6 or 19/16.  That may be because of the linear series,<br/>&gt;or the harmonic series, but in neither case are subharmonics implicated.<br/>&gt;There is the exception of ethnic flutes, which often play subharmonic<br/>&gt;series melodies, and after hearing such, it isn&apos;t too hard to sing them...</p><p>Are you buying into the Schlesinger equally-spaced holes argument? No,<br/>flutes aren&apos;t quite like strings. But ethnic frettings often incorporate<br/>equal spacings, producing subharmonic scales. Maybe that&apos;s one source of it.<br/>I think they could arise on other instruments and even vocally, though; if<br/>the common overtone happens to coincide with a resonance, a subharmonic<br/>arpeggio would really stand out.</p><p>By the way, Carl, you&apos;ve referred to &quot;linear series&quot; twice now. Are you<br/>being Wilsonified?</p><p>&gt;Historical evidence, maybe not (although Wilson may disagree).</p><p>Any examples?</p><p>&gt;But<br/>&gt;certainly the melodic validity of Keenan&apos;s chain-of-minor-thirds scales --<br/>&gt;or the 22-out-of-41 scale you proposed -- is not in dispute,</p><p>I recall much dispute over the latter from yourself, and please give us an<br/>mp3 of a nice melody with the former.</p><p>&gt;to say nothing<br/>&gt;of the myriad of proper MOS&apos;s of the 5/4, 7/6, 7/5, and 7/4.</p><p>Ditto.</p></div><h3>Paul H.

What about representations with intermediate numbers of dimensions?</p><p>&gt;I disputed the scale only because it&apos;s so big -- most melodies would be<br/>&gt;subsets of it.  And due to perceptual limitations, even a melody that did<br/>&gt;use the entire scale would probably fail to convey a 22-member melodic<br/>&gt;pitch set.

On first hearing, my culturally-conditioned ear wants to hear them as<br/>the usual octatonic scale in 12-equal (C Db Eb E F# G A Bb C) despite the<br/>fact that your scale is a linear chain. If I listen more, I may learn to<br/>hear them differently. You certainly get more harmonic contrast in<br/>your/Keenan&apos;s scale.</p></div>
