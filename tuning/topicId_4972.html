You tried this once before and evidently did not register our<br/>response. In classical harmonics, &quot;major&quot; (large) and &quot;minor&quot; (small) are<br/>terms of the trade, with varying values within particular tunings or<br/>temperaments. One cannot copyright a set of variables!</p><p>Once again, may I point out Lou Harrison&apos;s article &quot;ITEM: Five-Tone,<br/>Six-Tone, and Seven-Tone Modal Forms within the Traditional Matrix of Two<br/>Tetrachords separated by a Nine to Eight&quot; in Xenharmonikon 4, universal<br/>copyright 1975.  Harrison uses L and s to represent -- yes! -- LARGE and<br/>small.</p><p>Given your sense of priority, Mr. Harrison would be well within his rights to<br/>restrict _your_  use of the variables L and S.  Heck, he should probably ask<br/>you to recall all the copies of your book for correction.</p><p>Fortunately for you, he is a scholar and a gentleman, and wise enough to know<br/>better.</p><p>Daniel Wolf</p><p>Dr. Daniel J.
