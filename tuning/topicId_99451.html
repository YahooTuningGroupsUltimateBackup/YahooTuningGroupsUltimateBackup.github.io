You can get a triadic meantone pump like &quot;C major, A minor, D minor, G major, C major&quot; but you can also get a meantone pump with tetrads like &quot;C-major6, F-major6, G-major6, C-major&quot; (triad). The former takes 4 chords, the latter takes 3 chords, both of them use &quot;G E C A F D B G E C&quot; as the parent sequence of tones (i.e. a 7-tone scale). But, if you don&apos;t stick to a single-octave range for all voices of the progression, you&apos;ll probably use different octave equivalents of the same scale in each rendition.

Or how do you know<br/>&gt; what it is?</p><p>If you have a 5-limit major/minor triad and you want to get another triad by changing one pitch and preserving the other two (i.e. a major triad turns into a minor triad or vice versa), you get three possible intervals for pitch alteration -- namely 10/9, 16/15, 25/24. The interval which is mapped to the smallest number of generator in a particular temperament works as the primary diatonic step, the one mapped to a higher number of generators works as the secondary diatonic step, and the one mapped to the highest number of generators works as the chromatic step. Interestingly enough, for meantone, tetracot or amity, they&apos;re the same (10/9, 16/15, 25/24), while for hanson it&apos;s different (25/24, 10/9, 16/15) and for porcupine it&apos;s still different (10/9, 25/24, 16/15). So a 25/24 in hanson has a completely different meaning, in the hanson harmonic context, than a 25/24 in the meantone harmonic context.</p><p>Petr</p></div>
