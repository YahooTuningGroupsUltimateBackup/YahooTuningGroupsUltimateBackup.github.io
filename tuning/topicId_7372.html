Temperament is no good, but &quot;octave&quot; is?<br/>No one said there&apos;s anything wrong with &quot;Temperament&quot;.<br/>Clearly however, there is confusion with regard to simply calling any EDO a<br/>temperament, which is what that was about.</p><p>Monzo, that&apos;s a bizarre definition of temperament you&apos;ve got in the<br/>dictionary : &quot;a tuning which is not a just-intonation; that is, the<br/>intervals are not small-integer ratios&quot;</p><p>&gt; 3. &quot;chain tuning&quot; -- what it says<br/>&gt;     a) &quot;pythagorean&quot; -- chains of 3/2&apos;s reduced by 2/1&apos;s.<br/>&gt;     b) &quot;meantone&quot; -- chains of flat 3/2&apos;s, reduced by 2/1&apos;s, so that the<br/>&gt;        best 5/4 = 4 of them.  Can also been used to indicate any tuning<br/>&gt;        in which 4(3/2)=5/4, chained or no, with appropriate context.<br/>This sounds like a nice addition. Not that big a leap since &quot;chain of ...&quot;<br/>is common practice.</p><p>&gt; 4. &quot;microtonal&quot; -- for all non-12 music; if you don&apos;t like implications<br/>&gt;     of strangeness, don&apos;t say anything about tuning to your audience!<br/>Carl, understand that 12EDO is not a universal point of reference. I&apos;ve been<br/>listening to Middle Eastern, Indian, &amp; 12EDO music all my life. To me they<br/>are all just tunings, all just music. &quot;micro&quot; nothing.</p><p>&gt; What we have works.<br/>For their specific purposes, yes.</p><p>I can&apos;t believe you&apos;re implying that the handful of terms and theories<br/>we have are the be all &amp; end all, &amp; that they should never change, or<br/>expand. As the tuning arena expands, matures, &amp; diversifies, many more terms<br/>&amp; theories will turn up &amp; evolve.</p><p>If anyone&apos;s worried about too much terminology, don&apos;t be. Look up how many<br/>terms exist within the 12EDO arena alone. This is kid&apos;s stuff.</p><p>&gt; Use your own funky terms if you want, but why insist<br/>&gt; that somebody else does too?  If it ain&apos;t broke...<br/>Some of it is sort of broke, some is just lovely, while much of it does not<br/>exist. Such vehement resistance to change and progress is odd, anyhow<br/>nobody&apos;s forcing anyone to change. You can still call a car a horseless<br/>carriage, if that&apos;s your pleasure.</p><p>Just read TD465 :<br/>First you say :<br/>&gt; There is a great deal of dissatisfaction, and rightfully so.</p><p>Then you say :<br/>&gt; But the terms<br/>&gt; I&apos;m concerned with aren&apos;t &quot;temperament&quot; or &quot;microtone&quot;.  I&apos;m much more<br/>&gt; concerned with &quot;mode&quot;, &quot;5th&quot;, &quot;JI&quot;, etc.  We recently won a great victory<br/>&gt; with &quot;adaptive&quot; and &quot;strict&quot; JI.<br/>So, I guess this means that only what Carl is concerned with is worth<br/>discussing. Duh.</p><p>Free your mind &amp; the rest will follow.<br/>- Drew</p><p>__________________________________________________<br/>Do You Yahoo!?<br/>Talk to your friends online with Yahoo!
