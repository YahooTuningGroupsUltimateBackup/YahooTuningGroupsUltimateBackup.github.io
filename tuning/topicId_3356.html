It sounds a lot better<br/> using the Pythagorean pitch for the leading tone, and choosing<br/> the &apos;root&apos; and &apos;5th&apos; which make a nice 4:5:6 triad with it,<br/> in the corresponding area of the harmonic lattice.[....]&quot;&quot;&quot;</p><p>I wonder whether the term &quot;sharpened Pythagorean &apos;leading-tone&apos;&quot;<br/>here isn&apos;t perhaps pleonastic and potentially confusing too?  A<br/>Pythagorean Major third would be tuned wider than a pure one;  does<br/>monz mean that the third is even wider than a Pythagorean one would<br/>be?  Can one actually speak of a Pythagorean leading tone?  My<br/>understanding - limited, to be sure - is that intervals can be<br/>Pythagorean, but not tones.  And would &apos;raised&apos; not be a better term<br/>than &apos;sharpened&apos;, unless of course he&apos;s referring to the use of a #<br/>sign before the note;  but in that case he&apos;s lost me completely.</p><p>The description of a flat sounding chord also has me wondering.<br/>monz might mean that the *third of the chord* is lower than he<br/>expected, but not likely that there&apos;s a flat sign in front of it.<br/>But a *chord* might sound flat [= dull?] for some other reason than<br/>the tuning, so maybe he&apos;s not referring to the third at all.</p><p>As a relative novice to tuning matters, may I plead for more precise<br/>expression?  The subject is too complex to tolerate unclear use of<br/>terms like sharp and flat.</p><p>Thanx for the chance to rant.....</p><p>&#xFFFD;ale C. Carr</p></div>
