A lot of the music that &quot;uses&quot; symmetric<br/>scales-diminshed, augmented and whole tone-doesn&apos;t really rely on them<br/>being symmetrical, so the musical results might not be artistically<br/>inferior to the &quot;original&quot;, but it would not be &quot;symmetrical&quot; anymore<br/>when transferred to JI, or meantone for that matter.</p><p>&gt; How would you treat the tuning of the 4-tonic system?</p><p>You don&apos;t. :D</p><p>&gt; But if we wanted to<br/>&gt; retune the diminished scale to get just intervals, how<br/>&gt; would it affect the 4-tonic substitution chords?</p><p>Some would work and some would be completely destroyed. The only way<br/>to achieve the proper symmetry is to go equal.</p><p>&gt; One last question (for now) that pretty much<br/>&gt; summarizes everything above:  Are symmetric<br/>&gt; scales/chord progressions exclusive to edo tuning<br/>&gt; systems or is there such thing as Just Symmetry?</p><p>It all depends on what you mean by it. As in scales that repeat 2, 3<br/>or 4 times within an octave, that is itself a equal division, so it is<br/>not possible using only rational intervals. Though many JI scales do<br/>have a certain &quot;partial&quot; symmetry, that is most of the notes, or at<br/>least a subset, can be played in several different keys and form the<br/>whole scale when combined. If you mean inversional symmetry however,<br/>many of the (relatively) commonly used JI scales have that property,<br/>as inversion and transposition itself is not dependent on equal<br/>divisions, only the concept of equal divisions themselves are.</p><p>/&Atilde;Â–</p></div><h3><a id=67625 href="#67625">ðŸ”—</a>Mats &#xD6;ljare &#x3C;oljare@hotmail.com&#x3E;</h3><span>10/3/2006 3:00:34 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>&gt; &gt; Depends what you mean by symetrical.

Now I<br/>have even more questions though!<br/>I&apos;ve read/been taught that symmetry / patterning or<br/>even any type of chord substitution &apos;works&apos; in jazz<br/>(or other music too) because our ears accept the<br/>&apos;dissonance&apos; in favor of the logic of the patterns<br/>created - we hear the structures created (it&apos;s the<br/>&apos;wrong&apos; dominant chord but dominant chords have such a<br/>&apos;strong structure&apos; that it doesn&apos;t matter), or we hear<br/>that the notes form a pattern and excuse the fact that<br/>some of them don&apos;t &apos;fit&apos; the chords.<br/>My big question is if in some (or even all) cases,<br/>it&apos;s not just the patterns that make sense to our<br/>ears, but also that these &apos;outside&apos; notes are<br/>opproximations of higher prime limit rational<br/>intervals.</p><p>Mats &iuml;&iquest;&half;ljare wrote:</p><p>&gt;Well, some would say 13 is approximated by the major<br/>&gt; sixth in some<br/>&gt; complex chords, the minor sixth in others.

Individual chords and<br/>&gt; melodies can be,<br/>&gt; but not the entire scale itself, because each note<br/>&gt; has more than one<br/>&gt; unique intervallic relation to the others.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; Would the symmetrical sound/usage of the scale be<br/>&gt; &gt; destroyed if the intervals were just?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Practically, yes.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; Are symmetric scales too<br/>&gt; &gt; reliant on enharmonicity and patterns to be<br/>&gt; retuned<br/>&gt; &gt; and fitted into JI environments?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; It all depends on your views. A lot of the music<br/>&gt; that &quot;uses&quot; symmetric<br/>&gt; scales-diminshed, augmented and whole tone-doesn&apos;t<br/>&gt; really rely on them<br/>&gt; being symmetrical, so the musical results might not<br/>&gt; be artistically<br/>&gt; inferior to the &quot;original&quot;, but it would not be<br/>&gt; &quot;symmetrical&quot; anymore<br/>&gt; when transferred to JI, or meantone for that matter.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; How would you treat the tuning of the 4-tonic<br/>&gt; system?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; You don&apos;t. :D<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; But if we wanted to<br/>&gt; &gt; retune the diminished scale to get just intervals,<br/>&gt; how<br/>&gt; &gt; would it affect the 4-tonic substitution chords?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Some would work and some would be completely<br/>&gt; destroyed. The only way<br/>&gt; to achieve the proper symmetry is to go equal.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; One last question (for now) that pretty much<br/>&gt; &gt; summarizes everything above:  Are symmetric<br/>&gt; &gt; scales/chord progressions exclusive to edo tuning<br/>&gt; &gt; systems or is there such thing as Just Symmetry?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; It all depends on what you mean by it. As in scales<br/>&gt; that repeat 2, 3<br/>&gt; or 4 times within an octave, that is itself a equal<br/>&gt; division, so it is<br/>&gt; not possible using only rational intervals. Though<br/>&gt; many JI scales do<br/>&gt; have a certain &quot;partial&quot; symmetry, that is most of<br/>&gt; the notes, or at<br/>&gt; least a subset, can be played in several different<br/>&gt; keys and form the<br/>&gt; whole scale when combined. If you mean inversional<br/>&gt; symmetry however,<br/>&gt; many of the (relatively) commonly used JI scales<br/>&gt; have that property,<br/>&gt; as inversion and transposition itself is not<br/>&gt; dependent on equal<br/>&gt; divisions, only the concept of equal divisions<br/>&gt; themselves are.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; /&Atilde;Â–<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;</p><p>__________________________________________________<br/>Do You Yahoo!?<br/>Tired of spam?

The music you are talking about<br/>is made in 12-TET, not JI. It seems that many here and in other places<br/>are obsessed with &quot;rationalizing&quot; existing music and existing scales<br/>ignoring the fact that their full character comes from properties that<br/>are unseparably linked with 12-TET itself.</p><p>Turning 12-TET scales and compositions into ratios always assumes that<br/>each note has only ONE rational relationship to the others, while the<br/>depth and complexity of the compositions and the versatility of the<br/>scales more often than not comes from the fact that a pitch can be<br/>thought of as representing more than one ratio, at the same time. This<br/>is especially noticable in symmetrical scales and other &quot;strange&quot;<br/>modes and harmonies.</p><p>For example, the most common &quot;altered chord&quot;, C E Ab Bb Eb, can be<br/>thought of as approximating high-limit intervals, the Ab 13/8 and the<br/>Eb 19/8, or 7/3, and the Bb 7/4 with the Ab possibly interpreted as<br/>14/9, forming a sequence of forths from the 7/4. But there is also a<br/>Pythagorean (3-limit) interpretation, where C-Bb-Eb-Ab can be seen as<br/>a chain of fourths with only the F missing.</p><p>And if the E is assumed to be 5/4, it may be considered to have a<br/>5-limit relation with the three other tones, as 14/9 is off from 25/16<br/>by just a few cents, enough to completely take its place in practice,<br/>and E-Ab-Eb, with or without the Bb being a strong 5-limit chord with<br/>the C being 5-limit in the &quot;other direction&quot; from the E.</p><p>When you go into adding melodic lines that contain notes not found in<br/>the proper &quot;altered&quot; scale, the complexity increases further to what<br/>is simply &quot;unrationalizable&quot;.</p><p>/&Ouml;</p></div><h3><a id=67667 href="#67667">ðŸ”—</a>misterbobro &#x3C;misterbobro@yahoo.com&#x3E;</h3><span>10/9/2006 10:36:56 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;p_heddles&quot; &lt;p_heddles@...&gt; wrote:</p><p>&gt; That idea intrigues me - I&apos;m not entirely sure what you mean, but it<br/>&gt; sounds like an interesting challenge.
