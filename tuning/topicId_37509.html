The problem with microtemperaments is that the people who one would think would be *most* interested in them, namely the ones who find coarser temperaments too far out of tune, are the very ones who see red and become agitated when the possibility is raised. It makes it an answer to a question many people don&apos;t want asked, so I think plunging into the water myself might be just the thing.</p><p>&gt; it might be tuned in 612-equal, but it will not be extramusical.<br/>&gt; well, as a MIDI composition in gene&apos;s style, you&apos;ll hate the way it<br/>&gt; sounds, no doubt, but it will demonstrate the point, one that could<br/>&gt; certainly be exploited by John Doe&apos;s more musical pair of hands . . .</p><p>I admit it, my music is a little old-fashioned in some ways. Chords, melody, harmony, and all that sort of thing. I figure if you are going to optimize for harmony, you may as well put it to use.

It may not be the kind of music he likes, but it clearly isn&apos;t a bunch of paper formulas either.</p></div>
