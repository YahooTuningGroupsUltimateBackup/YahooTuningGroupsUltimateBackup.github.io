Actually, I think the original Pentium<br/>&gt; chip came out in 150 AD, so his measurements may have been<br/>&gt; afflicted by that chip&apos;s division bug.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Come on, Joe, what kind of accurate measurements could Ptolemy<br/>&gt; have made?</p><p>He used a monochord and a variant instrument of his own invention<br/>based on monochord design.</p><p>Of course, &apos;accurate&apos; is a relative term, and certainly,<br/>objectively speaking, Ptolemy&apos;s methods were far less accurate<br/>than some techniques we have available today.  But I can<br/>certify, from my own experience, that careful listening and<br/>comparison on a monochord can give an accuracy within a few<br/>cents - say, plus or minus 10 cents (I&apos;m guessing and giving<br/>the benefit of the doubt - the error may be less).</p><p>What I meant was that Ptolemy measured the intervals in a wide<br/>variety of scales, and came up with a correspondingly wide variety<br/>of ratios.  Certainly, part of his desiderata was to accomodate<br/>both the Aristoxenean and Pythagorean views on music theory,<br/>which wasn&apos;t easy, the one being based on musical observation<br/>by ear and the other by an avowed sovereignty of numerical<br/>relationship regardless of acoustical observation.</p><p>&gt; P.S. Didn&apos;t Johnny Reinhard tell you that diatonic music in<br/>&gt; Europe derived not from the Greeks but from another source<br/>&gt; (related to the Huns)? According to him, there was a definite<br/>&gt; discontinuity between the civilizations of classical antiquity<br/>&gt; and Christian Europe. Only later did scholars try to tie<br/>&gt; the two together, and apparently they were so succesful that<br/>&gt; many today suppose that one civilzation grew out of the other.</p><p>I wouldn&apos;t doubt that discontinuity one bit.  Indeed, one of the<br/>points I was trying emphasize in the post you quoted was that<br/>*German* influence in the development of early medieval music has<br/>been widely overlooked.</p><p>Their reputation as the most barbaric barbarians notwithstanding,<br/>the Huns apparently had quite a cozy relationship with the<br/>German Goths (I&apos;ll have to go to the library to get the reference<br/>if anyone&apos;s interested).</p><p>So I wouldn&apos;t be at all surprised if aspects of Hunnish music<br/>entered the European mainstream via the Goths, especially since<br/>the earliest and one of the most &apos;civilized&apos; of the German kindgoms<br/>was the Ostrogothic Kingdom in Italy in the late 400s and early 500s<br/>during Boethius&apos;s lifetime.  (&apos;Civilized&apos; is also a relative<br/>concept here: Boethius himself was cruelly tortured before his<br/>execution for treason.)</p><p>However, all that said, there is still no question that the<br/>ancient Greek theorists described a scale which they called<br/>&apos;diatonic&apos;, and whose ratios were virtually always the same<br/>(i.e., did not vary from one theorist to another as did the<br/>other genera), that is, Pythagorean (except for the different<br/>&apos;shades&apos; described by Aristoxenus and Ptolemy), and which<br/>largely agreed with what we think of today as diatonic.</p><p>Dante Rosati just recently mentioned, quoting the same post of<br/>mine, that the Greeks got the diatonic scale from Babylon,<br/>which I also have no reason to doubt.</p><p>So apparently the diatonic scale has been around since at<br/>least ancient Greece or Babylon.  And it doesn&apos;t seem to have<br/>gone out of use at any time since then.  Even tho there are<br/>a few breaks in the production of theory treatises from about<br/>200 to 900 AD, those in existence from either end of that period,<br/>and the few from within it, indicate that the diatonic scale was<br/>the one predominantly in use.</p><p>Of course, as far as actual *music* goes, the few scraps of<br/>ancient Greek compositions must be treated with extreme caution,<br/>as I have found much reason to be wary of the modern transcriptions<br/>of these pieces which I have seen; and the earliest manuscripts<br/>we have of real pieces in the &apos;modern&apos; European tradition, with a<br/>notation that indicates pitch, come from around the 900s.  So<br/>for any music composed before that, all we really have to go on<br/>is the descriptions by the theorists.</p><p>-monz</p><p>Joseph L.
