Then all the triads come out in JI within themselves.</p><p>&gt;Ok... so this is remedial...</p><p>&gt;I thought a 1/3 comma chain is what made the MINOR thirds just.  Why<br/>&gt;wouldn&apos;t it be a superimposed 1/3 comma chain rather than a 1/4 comma<br/>&gt;chain??  And wouldn&apos;t the 1/3 comma chain be BELOW the 1/4 comma<br/>&gt;chain since more of the comma has been subtracted??</p><p>Sorry Joseph, I should have been more clear. The first 1/4-comma meantone<br/>chain is used for the roots and for the major third _of a major triad_. The<br/>other chain, 1/4-comma higher, is used for the fifth _of triads_ and for the<br/>minor third _of a minor triad_. We&apos;re talking chord degrees rather than<br/>intervals here (gosh, if only music terminology wasn&apos;t so darn ambiguous).<br/>The reason this works is that 1/4-comma meantone has major thirds just,<br/>minor thirds 1/4 comma flat, and perfect fifths 1/4 comma flat. So the chain<br/>that&apos;s 1/4 comma higher gives you just minor thirds and perfect fifths<br/>against the notes in the lower chain.</p><p>If you superimposed a 1/3-comma meantone chain with a 1/4-comma meantone<br/>chain, the two chains would get farther and farther apart from one another<br/>as you moved away from the center along the chain of fifths. With two<br/>1/4-comma meantone chains, always 1/4 comma apart, you get all the just<br/>intervals you need for 5-limit triads anywhere along the chain of fifths.</p><p>Try working it out on paper (or better yet, with two keyboards) if you&apos;re<br/>still confused.</p></div><h3><a id=12778 href="#12778">ðŸ”—</a>Joseph Pehrson &#x3C;pehrson@pubmedia.com&#x3E;</h3><span>9/14/2000 1:07:37 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@egroups.com">tuning@egroups.com</a>, &quot;Paul H.
