First, concerning subharmonics.<br/>/&lt;&gt;There is some evidence that the spectra of the attack portions of<br/>/idiophone<br/>/&lt;&gt;sounds are simultaneously subharmonic. This is clearly an exceptional and<br/>/&lt;&gt;transient phenomenon, but one that does violate the notion that there are<br/>/&lt;&gt;no subharmonic series in nature.<br/>/&lt;<br/>/&lt;Mildly interesting; more info would be appreciated.</p><p>/This is more than mildly interesting to those of us working with<br/>/idiophones! I posted an extended review last summer of a recent book with<br/>/very detailed spectrographic analyses.</p></div>
