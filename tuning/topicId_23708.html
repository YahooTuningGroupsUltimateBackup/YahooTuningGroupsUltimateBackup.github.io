(The first chord<br/>is the same type of incomplete-9th, a &quot;4th&quot; higher, so<br/>harmonically this is V11 - I in G over the D drone, but<br/>to my ears the whole section functions as an extended ii<br/>in the tonic of D.)</p><p>&gt; I also spun the Hendrix chords, although, I couldn&apos;t<br/>&gt; figure out how to stay in sync between the text and<br/>&gt; the voicings AND my soundcard produced some &quot;sum tones&quot;<br/>&gt; (I&apos;m sure of it, strong pitches at the #11 region,<br/>&gt; which would be the sum of the b7 and #9) that made<br/>&gt; things... interesting but less informative.</p><p>I really should make mp3s of those _Hendrix Chord_ excerpts,<br/>because the types of affects I talk about on that webpage<br/>are not always heard on the other end if the user&apos;s MIDI<br/>doesn&apos;t produce an end result audio that&apos;s similar to mine.<br/>Thanks for pointing out these defects.</p><p>&gt;<br/>&gt; Just want to say as has been said before, your<br/>&gt; website is a great service.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; thanks,<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Bob Valentine</p><p>Thanks, Bob.
