In it<br/>he<br/>&gt; proposed that gravity is not a force but a curved field in the<br/>space-<br/>&gt; time continuum that is created by the presence of mass. People were<br/>&gt; astonished by the fact that space and time are under relativity.<br/>Even<br/>&gt; though, the world could stay ease within the determinism where<br/>there<br/>&gt; was a general algorithmic procedure for resolving all mathematical<br/>&gt; questions.<br/>&gt; But since Heisenberg&apos;s discovery,</p><p>Heisenberg&apos;s discovery has nothing to do with Einstein&apos;s theory of<br/>relativity, nor is it relevant for music. It seems like you&apos;re<br/>confusing at least three very different concepts here.</p><p>&gt; But over the centuries musicians, mathematicians, theorists,<br/>&gt; thinkers, experts and amateurs have been suffered from the comma<br/>&gt; which is the difference between a perfectly tuned octave and the<br/>&gt; octave resulting from a tuned circle of fifths.</p><p>That&apos;s only one type of comma -- the Pythagorean comma -- and it had<br/>been used as a feature, not always treated as a &quot;bug&quot;.</p><p>&gt; <a href="http://www.geocities.jp/imyfujita/wtcuncertain.html">http://www.geocities.jp/imyfujita/wtcuncertain.html</a></p><p>Your discussion here concerns the Classical Uncertainty Principle.<br/>This is a result from Fourier Analysis and has nothing to do with<br/>Quantum Mechanics or any of the innovations of the 20th century.</p><p>In fact you seem to acknowledge this yourself further in the page. So<br/>why all the obfuscation with appeals to modern physics?</p><p>The Classical Uncertainty principle does have a lot to do with music<br/>and many people, from posters on this list to designers of poor<br/>concert halls, have utterly failed to appreciate it.</p><p>Meanwhile, it&apos;s very easy to distinguish Bach&apos;s C major prelude in<br/>Equal Temperament from the same piece played in one of the<br/>historically appropriate temperaments such as Werckmeister III,<br/>Kellner Bach, Barnes Bach, etc. If your argument is intended to show<br/>that one can&apos;t hear the difference, it must be flawed in at least one<br/>respect. One of the flaws is that you treat the tones as if they were<br/>sine waves. Have you considered the *harmonics* of the notes playing<br/>(which are quite loud on a harpsichord) and that they&apos;ll lead to a<br/>smaller uncertainty than the fundamentals alone? A harpsichord<br/>doesn&apos;t play sine waves! And our ears/brains typically determine the<br/>pitch of fundamentals from the 3rd through 6th harmonics, not<br/>necessarily (or even often) from the fundamental itself.</p><p>Also, your assertion that piano strings tuned in equal temperament<br/>will synchronize into JI when a major chord is played is simply<br/>wishful thinking. Try an actual experiment where you do some<br/>measurements and you&apos;ll see what I mean. Equal temperament is far too<br/>severe a mistuning for the weak coupling between piano strings to<br/>push them into a mode-locked behavior.</p></div><h3>wallyesterpaulrus &#x3C;wallyesterpaulrus@yahoo.com&#x3E;</h3><span>2/22/2005 1:19:44 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;Aaron K.
