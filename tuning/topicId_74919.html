Resolution options are still available using TBXE software.</p><p>The bypass feature improvement was requested by TBX1 owner Jeff Berg of<br/>&lt;<a href="http://www.unfretted.com">http://www.unfretted.com</a>&gt;<br/>who uses TBX1 with GR series Roland guitar synthesizers -- thanks, Jeff!</p><p>TBX1 is a portable hardware retuning device for multi-timbral synthesizers supporting pitch bend. It stores 128 tunings in 4 layers = 512 tuning tables of 128 notes each, all user programmable using TBXE (featuring Scala file import), all immediately accessible at the push of a button.</p><p>Download TBXE for free (Mac or Windows):<br/>&lt;<a href="http://www.h-pi.com/downloads.html">http://www.h-pi.com/downloads.html</a>&gt;</p><p>TBX1 can be purchased here:<br/>&lt;<a href="http://www.h-pi.com/TBX1buy.html">http://www.h-pi.com/TBX1buy.html</a>&gt;</p><p>Thanks for your continued support.</p><p>Yours,<br/>Aaron Hunt<br/>H-Pi Instruments</p><p>NOTE: This announcement is taken from from the H-Pi Instruments Community Forum at<br/>&lt;<a href="http://www.h-pi.com/phpBB2/">http://www.h-pi.com/phpBB2/</a>&gt;<br/>which interested readers are invited to join.
