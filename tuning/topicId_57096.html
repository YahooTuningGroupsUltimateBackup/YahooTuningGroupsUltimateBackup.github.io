Whenever something is added or updated on the site (or more likely, to a particular area or page on the site), the RSS file gets regenerated.  The file has stuff like the title of the item and either a summary or the full text of the item, and it can contain multiple items like this.</p><p>People use RSS readers (e.g., <a href="http://www.bradsoft.com/feeddemon/">http://www.bradsoft.com/feeddemon/</a>, or the one built into <a href="http://my.yahoo.com">my.yahoo.com</a>) to &quot;subscribe&quot; to multiple RSS files, meaning that the reader checks the RSS at those sites on a periodic basis, like once an hour or once a day, and tells you when there&apos;s new/updated material.  So this keeps people from having to remember to check the site manually.  The RSS reader will display the data from the RSS, which could be an excerpt, or full text, or just a link back to the original site.</p><p>For example, here&apos;s the URL to the RSS on my music site: <a href="http://mysterybear.net/?rss=1">http://mysterybear.net/?rss=1</a> (it won&apos;t look like much in a browser unless you use View Source).</p><p>It&apos;s a very widely used technology that&apos;s pretty simple, but adds a whole level of accessibility to a site.</p><p>Here are a couple of references:<br/><a href="http://www.webreference.com/authoring/languages/xml/rss/intro/">http://www.webreference.com/authoring/languages/xml/rss/intro/</a><br/><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RSS_(protocol)">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RSS_(protocol)</a></p><p>- Dave</p><p>monz wrote:<br/>&gt; &gt; hi Dave,<br/>&gt; &gt; --- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, Dave Seidel &lt;dave@s...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;Hi Joe, the site is looking nice!
