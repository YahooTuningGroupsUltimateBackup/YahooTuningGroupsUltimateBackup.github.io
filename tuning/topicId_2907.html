I don&apos;t consider 36:45:54:64 is even one of the candidates<br/>for being a reasonable 7th chord.  Some examples where there is doubt is<br/>when we play C-D which might be 8:9 but might be 9:10 and likewise for<br/>some 3 and 4 note chords, but never 36:45:54:64.</p><p>Someone might speak unclearly in saying for example &quot;I am not sure that<br/>you are right&quot; in that they could mean &quot;I am unsure&quot; or &quot;I think you are<br/>wrong&quot; but they don&apos;t mean &quot;Call on the Spannish Inquisition&quot; if you see<br/>what I mean.</p><p>&gt; What criteria do you use to determine which notes are the<br/>&gt; &apos;main&apos; ones and which are the &apos;others&apos;?</p><p>I will post on the subject &quot;Central Ratio of a Scale&quot; in the near future<br/>and answer this question in great detail, or at least gives a background<br/>which allows this.</p><p>&gt; What method do you<br/>&gt; use to determine the &apos;multiple possible different&apos; rational<br/>&gt; interpretations for those others?  What method to determine<br/>&gt; which is the interpretation that applies?</p><p>See the little slide rule device that I quoted in my post as being at<br/><a href="http://www.kcbbs.gen.nz/users/rtomes/aji-a.gif">http://www.kcbbs.gen.nz/users/rtomes/aji-a.gif</a> which I recommend that<br/>you print out and cut in half horizontally.  If you slide the halves<br/>along you can answer all these questions.  It basically recognises that<br/>the ratios 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 etc occur at spacings in semitones in 12-tET<br/>of 0 12 19 24 28 31 34 36 etc.  By checking a set of notes against this<br/>scale it is possible to find the simplest (and other nearly as simple)<br/>arrangement that fits.  Of course if music is not written in a 12<br/>semitone scale then this does not apply.  However the same principle can<br/>be applied with a different table of numbers.</p><p>The question of which is the best choice is also addressed in my AJI<br/>paper and a number of possible scoring schemes are considered.  I think<br/>that these need trying out and seeing what works in practice.</p><p>&gt; I know that you&apos;re guided largely by natural cycles in the<br/>&gt; universe, but music provides **quite** a variety of different<br/>&gt; contexts within which one may try to make a rational<br/>&gt; interpretation of the harmonies or pitches, and the<br/>&gt; subjectivity of the listener itself affects this too.</p><p>The subjectivity of the listener is a part of the universe.<br/>Our instincts, emotions, reactions are all built from aeons of existence<br/>in the universe behaving as it does.  However this is not important to<br/>my argument - there is no reason to not use correct frequencies.  I wish<br/>that I hadn&apos;t mentioned &quot;nature&quot; at all because it is not really the key<br/>point that I want to make which is &quot;why not have correct frequencies?&quot;</p><p>&gt; In many cases where irrational pitches are specified they carry<br/>&gt; numerical significance of their own, which is (I think) a point<br/>&gt; Dans Stearns tries to make repeatedly.</p><p>&gt; I believe Charles Lucy would agree with that too, although he<br/>&gt; doesn&apos;t like me calling his scale &apos;irrational&apos;, but that&apos;s what<br/>&gt; it is, by definition.</p><p>It is certainly possible that irrational ratios may be desired.<br/>I am not saying that this should not be done.  I am saying that we<br/>should not get irrationality by default and no other option.  That is<br/>only chaos gone mad.  I think that Charles may well be right that pi<br/>does occur naturally in some cases.</p><p>&gt; Actually, I&apos;m not at all sure that a *strict* rule can&apos;t be<br/>&gt; used, but it would most certainly have to be an extremely<br/>&gt; *complex* rule if it were to be strict.  The *simple* strict<br/>&gt; rule is the one that &apos;will often be wrong&apos;.</p><p>This is true.  However it is also true that even a simple rule will<br/>produce more pleasant chords than any ET scale does, even if it<br/>sometimes gets a wrong match on the ratios for a chord.  From there on<br/>it is all profits in the bank.</p><p>&gt; Much of the recent discussion in this forum (which you&apos;ve missed)<br/>&gt; has been precisely about how to measure exactly that complexity,<br/>&gt; and that&apos;s the very word we&apos;ve kicked around.

The problem is, what are they?</p><p>I know you have an answer ready, but I&apos;m afraid it&apos;s just<br/>not that simple.</p><p>As I said, music generally is full of dynamics of tension<br/>and resolution, and the numbers involved in this interplay<br/>don&apos;t have to be, but certainly *can* be, quite complex.</p><p>Music based on simple JI ratios usually lacks tension,<br/>which is great if that&apos;s what you&apos;re aiming for; but if<br/>it&apos;s not...  We live in a world full of tension, and rather<br/>than escape from that in their music, some composers like<br/>to reflect it, and even wallow in it.<br/>(do you hear me Dan Stearns?)   :)</p><p>Also, you can&apos;t just assume that because digital electronics<br/>is a JI panacaea for you (and it is for me too), that other<br/>musicians want to give up playing instruments with strings<br/>and holes and keyboard levers.</p><p>For those instruments, it&apos;s imperative to conscientiously design<br/>a tuning system beforehand, and there are a lot of other factors<br/>that go into that design besides mere rational or otherwise<br/>&apos;in tune with nature&apos; correctness.</p><p>36:45:54:64 can be, is, and was, either used or implied for<br/>the &apos;dominant 7th&apos; chord on keyboards and other instruments for<br/>maybe a couple of centuries.  Just because you don&apos;t consider<br/>it &apos;even one of the candidates for being a reasonable 7th chord&apos;<br/>doesn&apos;t mean other people don&apos;t.</p><p>As I said, in &apos;classical&apos; music, it&apos;s very effective in a typical<br/>cadential formula, and I am prepared to argue that it would be<br/>the proper tuning of the chord in, say, a Beethoven string quartet<br/>(altho string players probably wouldn&apos;t agree because they<br/>like Pythagorean intervals).</p><p>This is the major criticism I have of Easley Blackwood&apos;s<br/>otherwise excellent book _The Structure of Recognizable Diatonic<br/>Tunings_.  He consistently wants to use the simplest rational<br/>interpretation for diatonic music, and it unfortunately just<br/>doesn&apos;t work that way.</p><p>[Ray]<br/>&gt; I clearly need to have a look at some recent posts in the<br/>&gt; archives.

The very<br/>flat Bb falling to A has, to my ear, all the more sense of resolution<br/>than the larger step implied by Monzo&apos;s tuning.
