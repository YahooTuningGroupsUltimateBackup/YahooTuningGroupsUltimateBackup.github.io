Partch the mastermind of modern monophony wrote intense music, while some it does jangle, the power of The Dreamer,the 11 intrusions and Ulysses(pre-beefheartian bliss) completely fulfills his purpose. While i am more interested recently in the theatre of the singular event and minimalist approaches, i for one was drawn to Partch first for the holistic &quot;maximal&quot; appeal of the music and then to the thorough specificity of the theories.<br/>while Genesis may require two full readings to comprehend, the music is instantly lucid despite the occaisonal &quot;jangle&quot;.<br/>pagano</p><p>At Thu, 14 Oct 1999 15:39:04 -0700, you wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;From: &quot;D.Stearns&quot; &lt;<a href="mailto:stearns@capecod.net">stearns@capecod.net</a>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;[Rosati:]<br/>&gt;&gt;I don&apos;t think he really had any sensitivity to the subtleties of the<br/>&gt;intervals he was using, especially vertically. Too much of it sounds<br/>&gt;random and jangly.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;I&apos;ve always thought that this was one of the most curious twists of<br/>&gt;fate in the whole contemporary tuning narrative; that Harry Partch --<br/>&gt;literately the voice of a tuning reform based squarely on aural<br/>&gt;causation -- would end up creating a music that the majority of folks<br/>&gt;of a similar (tuning reform based on aural causation, and some innate<br/>&gt;teleological righteousness) persuasion would probably find acutely<br/>&gt;unpalatable.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;Q: I&apos;m curious as to whether those here on the TD think that Harry<br/>&gt;Partch&apos;s *MUSIC* had of a more salient impact on the alternative<br/>&gt;tuners, or on (what I&apos;ll loosely band together and call) the DIY EMI<br/>&gt;folks?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;Dan<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt;You do not need web access to participate.
