These are<br/>&gt; trivial Partchian o- or utonalities.  The most interesting CPS are<br/>&gt; usually closer to the center.  One could take 2 hexanies and superpose<br/>&gt; them to get 12 notes.  Or if you&apos;re clever you could perhaps overlap<br/>&gt; two dekanies and find 8 notes that overlap.  Erv has a superposed<br/>&gt; dekany scale, which alas has 14 notes...<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; !<br/>&gt;  Union of 2|5 and 3|5 [1 3 5 7 9] dekanies.<br/>&gt;  14<br/>&gt; !<br/>&gt;  21/20<br/>&gt;  9/8<br/>&gt;  7/6<br/>&gt;  5/4<br/>&gt;  21/16<br/>&gt;  7/5<br/>&gt;  35/24<br/>&gt;  3/2<br/>&gt;  63/40<br/>&gt;  5/3<br/>&gt;  7/4<br/>&gt;  9/5<br/>&gt;  15/8<br/>&gt;  2/1<br/>&gt; !<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; ...but remember you&apos;re free to choose the harmonic identities, and<br/>&gt; with this choice you may find a case with more overlaps.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; You could also leave out 3 tones of a 15-tone CPS from the 6th row.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Last but not least, here is a very uneven 12-tone scale of mine<br/>&gt; which is derived from the 7-limit stellated hexany (hexany with<br/>&gt; its triads completed to 7-limit o- and utonalities).  Specifically,<br/>&gt; the st. hexany has 14 tones, and this simply omits 2 of them...<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; !<br/>&gt;  12-out-of [4 5 6 7] stellated hexany.<br/>&gt;  12<br/>&gt; !<br/>&gt;  21/20<br/>&gt;  7/6<br/>&gt;  6/5<br/>&gt;  5/4<br/>&gt;  21/16<br/>&gt;  7/5<br/>&gt;  3/2<br/>&gt;  8/5<br/>&gt;  42/25<br/>&gt;  7/4<br/>&gt;  9/5<br/>&gt;  2/1<br/>&gt; !<br/>&gt; !
