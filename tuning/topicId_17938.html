When the string is first struck, it&apos;d be at the minimum tension<br/>     and therefore frequency.  Within a fraction of a second, the key<br/>     would continue down to its computer-controlled stop, bringing the<br/>     frequency to the desired place, but I have to believe that the<br/>     transition would be audible and undesirable.</p><p>   . As the key is released, the string would first fall back to its<br/>     minimum frequency, then stop sounding, another &quot;blip&quot; in the sound.</p><p>   . While the string is sounding at the desired frequency, wouldn&apos;t<br/>     the key pressure required be substantial, even for a lightly-strung<br/>     clavichord-like instrument?  I can&apos;t believe that&apos;d be fun.</p><p>   . The keys would be unevenly depressed to satisfy tuning for each<br/>     note.</p><p>&gt;Seems like a simple loop-feedback system in charge of keydip.
