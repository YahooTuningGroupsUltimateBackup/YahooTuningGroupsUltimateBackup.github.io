Please take a moment to review<br/>the file and let me know what y&apos;all think.  This post and the html file<br/>contain my latest thoughts on the tuning for the microtonal carillon I am<br/>building.  The carillon will use steel bars driven by solenoids and<br/>amplified through large outdoor PA speakers.</p><p>The first table in the file is the 15 limit tonality diamond, nothing new<br/>-- included for reference.</p><p>The tuning I am considering for the carillon will use the 15 limit matrix<br/>intervals as a scale (49 tones to the octave), ala Partch, but will be<br/>arranged in such a way as to allow easy access to each harmonic and<br/>subharmonic scale of the matrix.  The tuning will comprise two complete<br/>octaves of the scale.  1/1 will be 192 hertz, 4/1 will be 768.  99 bars<br/>will be manufactured with the first three partials tuned to 1/1, 3/1, and<br/>5/1. I have successfully developed a method for achieving this relationship<br/>of partials to a great level of accuracy.  It just so happens that the 4th<br/>partial just about lands on an 8/1, although I have not been able to<br/>measure it very accurately due to equipment problems.  If anyone is<br/>interested, I will post detailed tuning data and notes.</p><p>The second table in the file illustrates the keyboard layout.  It features<br/>128 keys in an 8 by 16 format.  The keyboard can be either a matrix midi<br/>controller or use simple analog swiches to drive the solenoids directly.</p><p>Each subharmonic scale from 16 to 9 is available on a diagonal, and each<br/>harmonic series based on the subharmonics 16 to 9 of 1/1=384 extend from<br/>the first diagonal line of subharmonics.  I may arrange the keyboard as a<br/>rhomboid so that the subharmonic scales are found in vertical or near<br/>vertical lines.</p><p>Also note that I have &quot;stolen&quot; a few of the 2/1&apos;s to make them 4/1.  This<br/>will create some variations in the fingering of some of the scales, but<br/>will allow for a complete 2nd octave to 4/1.</p><p>I believe this arrangement gives the best of both worlds.  It allows for<br/>playing of the 8x8 matrix in its pure form, and at the same time uses the<br/>matrix resources as a scale allowing for voice leading, chord inversions<br/>and melodic lines not possible with a strict matrix.</p><p>There are of course large gaps  (esp. between 1/1 and 16/15, 15/8 and 2/1)<br/>which could be filled in Partch-style with secondary intervals to yeild a<br/>continuous 15 limit scale.  I have played around with substituting some of<br/>the duplicated intervals in the keyboard  (ie 1/1, 2/1, 4/3, 3/2, 8/5, 5/3<br/>and 6/5) and including the resourses that Partch added to his scale.  I was<br/>actually able to include all of his secondary intervals, although<br/>substituting these intervals in for the repeated ones creates alot of<br/>inconsistancy in the keyboard fingerings for some of the basic scales.  Of<br/>couse, the 13 and 15 limits suggest additional secondary resourses for<br/>which there is simply not enough room to include them in the context of a 8<br/>by 16 keyboard.  If I go the route of an analog keyboard with switches<br/>directly driving the solenoids, then I would consider adding a second small<br/>bank of keys to play the bars tuned to the secondary intervals.   A matrix<br/>midi controller would require a second midi channel if secondary intervals<br/>were added in a extra bank of keys.</p><p>Peace,<br/>Darren Burgess<br/>SEJIS<br/>Gainesville FL</p></div><h3>Darren Burgess &#x3C;dburgess@xxxxxxxxxxxx.xxxx&#x3E;</h3><span>3/14/1999 6:18:36 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Dear Tuning Folk:</p><p>I have uploaded the tables referred to in this post to<br/><a href="http://www.acceleration.net/dburgess/matrix.html">www.acceleration.net/dburgess/matrix.html</a>.
