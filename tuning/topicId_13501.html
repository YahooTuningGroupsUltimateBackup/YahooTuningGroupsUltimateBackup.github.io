My main complaint about it is that it&apos;s getting harder to<br/>do anything innovative in this system...it&apos;s a bit played out for me. On<br/>the other hand, I just did a show called &quot;Parade,&quot; which won a Tony last<br/>year for best score...it&apos;s interesting to me, because although the<br/>composer did absolutely nothing innovative, musically, the score,<br/>lyrics, and story line combined were very good, powerful and moving<br/>(it&apos;s about a Jewish guy who got lynched in Atlanta in 1915). The longer<br/>I did it, the more I liked it...hated to see them move on to Seattle. I<br/>learned a lot of things from playing/studying this guy&apos;s writing<br/>style...he&apos;s very good at arranging, orchestrating, meshing lyrics to<br/>rhythms and time signatures, and he covered a wide range of stylistic<br/>genres...plus, he&apos;s just a masterful composer. Overall, I can see why he<br/>won a Tony. I don&apos;t know if it would been any better in another tuning<br/>or not...it surely would have SOUNDED different, perhaps more innovative<br/>in that one department...but, whether or not it would have had a deeper<br/>emotional impact by being in a non12 tuning, I&apos;ll never know...when<br/>everything is added up, tuning is indeed one of many pieces of music<br/>that makes it what it is... whether it&apos;s the most important is an<br/>interesting issue...Hstick</p></div>
