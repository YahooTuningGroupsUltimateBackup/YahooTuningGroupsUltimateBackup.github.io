Maximally even sets come up in<br/>statistical mechanics and other fundamental areas where the energy of<br/>ensembles of particles are considered, specifically, ME sets come up in<br/>one dimensional Ising models. Krantz and his students are currently<br/>extending their ideas to two and more dimensions.</p><p>As for the Mandelbrot stuff, I am sure it is a hoax, or Schipke is<br/>desperately trying to find something that isn&apos;t there. Consider this<br/>statement &quot;Schipke continues: &quot;What was interesting at this point was<br/>that we looked back at the words of O Fortuna, and suddenly they fell<br/>into place. Verse two - Luck / like the moon /<br/>changeable in state / We are cast down / like straws upon a ploughed<br/>field / Our fates measuring / the eternal circle - is very clearly an<br/>allusion to the Buffon&apos;s Needle<br/>method.&quot; Uh uh. Na ga da.<br/>&#x9;While it is reasonable to expect that certain artistic iterations may<br/>produce objects resembling those arising from modern day fractal<br/>computations (take a circle, graft three circles to its perimeter, graft<br/>three circles to their perimeters, etc.), the crotch of the M set is<br/>clearly seen on this page. Getting that detail right is very unlikely.<br/>&#x9;On the other hand Gaston Julia did hand calculations and sketches right<br/>after WWI (and published his conclusions in 1928) of the Mandelbrot<br/>set&apos;s companion set (now called the Julia set), and there are examples<br/>of fractals in Chinese, Indian, and Islamic art.</p><p>--<br/>John Starrett<br/>&quot;We have nothing to fear but the scary stuff.&quot;<br/><a href="http://www-math.cudenver.edu/~jstarret/microtone.html">http://www-math.cudenver.edu/~jstarret/microtone.html</a></p></div>
