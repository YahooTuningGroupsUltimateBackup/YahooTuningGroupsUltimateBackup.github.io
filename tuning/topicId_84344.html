There has been considerable research done on the subject since that publication, and WinAural (an early version in the Gnaural lineage) was used as the audio stimulus for at least one published study, &quot;The Induced Rhythmic Oscillations of Neural Activity in the Human Brain&quot;, D. Cvetkovic, D. Djuwari, I. Cosic (Australia), from Proceeding (417) Biomedical Engineering - 2004.</p></div>
