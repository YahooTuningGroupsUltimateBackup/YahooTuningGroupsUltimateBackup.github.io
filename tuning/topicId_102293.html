I&apos;m pretty sure most of you could give a rat&apos;s ass about a &quot;guaranteed meantone successor&quot;.  But perhaps some of you are generally concerned with this problem; if so, read on.</p><p>I think this is an important theoretical problem, perhaps the most important one faced by this community, but one that is still a long way from being properly addressed.  Carl wrote:</p><p>&gt;The regular mapping paradigm is broadly useful, but one of<br/>&gt;its uses is to generalize Western polyphonic music under<br/>&gt;the assumption that it required a specialized tuning system<br/>&gt;and, through cultural evolution, found one. For composers<br/>&gt;interested in writing polyphonic music with melody, harmony,<br/>&gt;motivic structure, etc. but a different tuning system, the<br/>&gt;theory ought to be able reduce the number of systems they<br/>&gt;need to try before finding one. That would be useful since<br/>&gt;trying novel systems is apparently hard (maybe even requiring<br/>&gt;generations of effort). If we can furnish a top-9 list<br/>&gt;guaranteed to contain at least one viable meantone successor,<br/>&gt;it would be a good thing. In fact we can answer the question<br/>&gt;&quot;Why hasn&apos;t this been done yet?&quot; by saying that the evolution<br/>&gt;of music was stuck in a local minimum and only deliberate<br/>&gt;theory (not a random walk) could get it out.</p><p>Meantone (and eventually, 12-TET) arose as the solution to compositional problems, after centuries of cultural &quot;natural selection&quot;.  There are many reasons to believe that it is, in fact, the &quot;best&quot; solution to the problems it was meant to solve.  Because of this, the way we are currently applying the regular mapping paradigm to the problem of finding a &quot;guaranteed meantone successor&quot;--by this I mean the process of making these best-of lists for various prime limits--is, I believe, doomed to failure.</p><p>We are not going to find a temperament that is better at solving all the same problems as meantone/12-TET.  This should be patently obvious by now.  Think about what the problems *are* that meantone/12-TET solve: these tunings optimize the competing factors of having many intervals that sound very concordant, few intervals that sound very discordant, and few enough intervals to be comfortably played on an acoustic instrument.  12-TET (but not meantone in general) also solves the problems of being able to freely modulate to any key without a change in concordance, and also some other problems that are more instrument- or pedagogy-specific (which we don&apos;t need to worry about addressing just yet).  After decades of systematic exploration via the RMP, we know now that there are more accurate temperaments, and there are simpler temperaments, but there is no temperament that is both more accurate on the 5-limit AND simpler (or even equally-accurate but simpler or equally-simple but more accurate...or even equally-accurate and equally-simple!).  We also know, thanks to Keenan Pepper&apos;s exploration of the average dyadic harmonic entropy of rank-2 scales of comparable size to meantone and 12-TET, that meantone[7] is *significantly* lower in average dyadic HE than any other scale of 7 or more notes.</p><p>Therefore, any other 5-limit (or 7-limit, or 11-limit, or 13-limit) temperament is going to be in some respect inferior to meantone at solving the compositional problems that meantone solves.  Can we all agree on that?</p><p>Now, I don&apos;t think this means a &quot;meantone killer&quot; is impossible.  But to find such a temperament, we have to instead look to compositional problems that meantone *does not* excel in solving.  There are a lot of these, so what we really need to find is a problem not solved by meantone that is actually musically-relevant in the modern musical climate.  We have not even been making the slightest effort to examine this so far as I&apos;ve seen in all my time in this community, despite the fact that the composers among us (and the preferences they have developed) could potentially give some great insights into this question.</p><p>We have instead taken pretty much all of our cues from the advocates of higher-limit JI (since one thing meantone doesn&apos;t do is give a lot of 7, 11, and 13-limit intervals), and looked for temperaments of the 7-, 11-, and 13-limit.  But we&apos;ve done so without taking a good, hard look at what compositional problems are solved by higher-limit JI (and temperaments thereof).  Without having such an anchor in the practical, there&apos;s no reason to think that our &quot;best-of&quot; lists here are going to have a better-than-random chance at leading to a &quot;guaranteed meantone successor&quot;.</p><p>So maybe now would be a good time to open up the floor to some compositional problems that could be optimally solved by something other than meantone?</p></div><h3>genewardsmith &#x3C;genewardsmith@...&#x3E;</h3><span>1/2/2012 10:16:33 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;cityoftheasleep&quot; &lt;igliashon@...&gt; wrote:</p><p>&gt; So maybe now would be a good time to open up the floor to some compositional problems that could be optimally solved by something other than meantone?<br/>&gt;</p><p>Have you been asleep while I&apos;ve been posting all these lists of essentially tempered chords?</p></div><h3>Mike Battaglia &#x3C;battaglia01@...&#x3E;</h3><span>1/2/2012 11:11:04 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>On Mon, Jan 2, 2012 at 1:05 PM, cityoftheasleep &lt;igliashon@...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Now, I don&apos;t think this means a &quot;meantone killer&quot; is impossible.

And miracle&apos;s been on my list of<br/>things to figure out for a while too.</p><p>The real point that I&apos;m not satisfied with is that we don&apos;t really<br/>know what we&apos;re looking for. The Bach retunings clearly show that<br/>common practice music gets &quot;unintelligible&quot; when the categorical<br/>structure becomes undecipherable, not when the ratios change from what<br/>we&apos;re used to. In comparison, the ratios involved tell us to some<br/>extent how &quot;pleasantly intoned&quot; everything is, which is also<br/>important, if not the all-encompassing singular facet of musical<br/>experience. Of course, it could become the all-encompassing singular<br/>facet of musical experience if people start writing music that<br/>prioritizes that over all else, which in itself would be quite a<br/>departure from meantone and lead to a new mode of perception for<br/>music.</p><p>The point is that these &quot;best of&quot; temperament lists tell us the best<br/>structures to intone things. They, as well as the theory they derive<br/>from, ignore any other possible dimensions of musical experience which<br/>could exist. This isn&apos;t the end of the world, because at least we have<br/>something to start with, and as we come up with new things, we&apos;ll just<br/>keep on adding to what we have.</p><p>-Mike</p></div><h3>Carl Lumma &#x3C;carl@...&#x3E;</h3><span>1/2/2012 1:22:52 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Igs wrote:</p><p>&gt; Meantone (and eventually, 12-TET) arose as the solution to<br/>&gt; compositional problems, after centuries of cultural &quot;natural<br/>&gt; selection&quot;.

While there were obvious sets of compositional desideratum that meantone and then 12-TET can be said to clearly fulfill, as expressed in the compositional approaches taken around the time of their development and adoption, I don&apos;t see any cultural forces driving music to evolve further up the harmonic series.  Well, perhaps what Keenan&apos;s getting at, the fusion of Western tonal harmony with Eastern melodic forms (which obviously suggests incorporating one or both of the 11th and 13th harmonics and harmonies thereof).  Or maybe there is something to be said for &quot;novelty&quot; as a driving force, particularly in the form of harmonies in the &quot;xen&quot; zone between the 7 and 17-limit.</p><p>&gt; On balance though I still think it&apos;s worth pursuing top-9<br/>&gt; lists for the reason I gave... especially since I&apos;m trying<br/>&gt; to do so myself.  ;)</p><p>The reason you gave was that a top-9 list would be worthwhile if it saved people time and gave at least one guaranteed meantone successor.  This assumes that we know what a meantone successor looks like, or that we know what constitutes the sort of thing that people are looking for.  I&apos;m not convinced we do, nor that we&apos;ve spent enough time considering these more basic questions.  Instead, it&apos;s like we just said &quot;meantone does lots of good 5-limit harmonies, and some pretty good 7-limit harmonies when extended a bit; let&apos;s generalize the idea of temperament so we can find other things that do what meantone does, and people will be sure to like the results!&quot;.</p><p>&gt; I think porcupine is almost as good as meantone in the<br/>&gt; 5-limit.</p><p>Who&apos;s gonna pay twice the price for something of less quality?  &quot;Almost as good&quot; isn&apos;t good enough.  And I wouldn&apos;t even call porcupine &quot;almost as good&quot; as meantone in the 5-limit--the one advantage porcupine has over the 5-limit JI diatonic only makes sense if we look at it as an 11-limit (or <a href="http://2.3.5.11">2.3.5.11</a> subgroup) temperament.  A 7-note MOS with only 4 concordant 5-limit triads, tuned even less accurately than in meantone, is pathetic, and if that&apos;s the best we can do for a &quot;guaranteed meantone successor&quot;, then we&apos;re screwed and we should stop now.  Even the JI diatonic gives 5 concordant 5-limit triads.  Meantone&apos;s chief advantage is that it provides even more 5-limit concords than JI; porcupine lacks that advantage.  It only looks worthwhile if we interpret it the way Keenan likes to, as substituting 11-limit concords in place of 5-limit discords.  But we still ought to be asking just how concordant the 11-limit really is, what the point of using it over a lower limit system might be, and who (if anyone) would be interested in apply it--what&apos;s it good for, anyway?</p><p>&gt; Good enough to warrant more than 0.0000001%<br/>&gt; of 5-limit music being written in it.

Can we all agree on that?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; If you&apos;re willing to go up to 10/oct I&apos;m not sure it&apos;s<br/>&gt; still true.  I&apos;d have to review Keenan&apos;s results.</p><p>No temperament of greater than 7 notes will have lower average dyadic HE than the best temperament of 7 notes or fewer.

Let&apos;s also not forget Augene[9] and August[9] (which intersect at 12-TET IIRC), Dimisept[8], and Injera[10]--all among the shortlist of 7-limt temperaments according to Paul&apos;s paper, all represented in 12-TET and probably utilized in extant music to a significant extent.  The only compositional problems solved by more optimal meantone[7] and pajara[10] tunings is the problem of discordance, which patently seems to be a non-issue in modern musical culture.  There is a subculture interested in greater concordance than 12-TET, and it is unquestionably the dominant force in microtonal music and theory, but it&apos;s pretty solidly divorced from mainstream musical taste...and also probably more interested in JI and micro temperaments than anything meantone-like anyway.</p><p>-Igs</p></div><h3>Keenan Pepper &#x3C;keenanpepper@...&#x3E;</h3><span>1/2/2012 3:19:52 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;cityoftheasleep&quot; &lt;igliashon@...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; --- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;Keenan Pepper&quot; &lt;keenanpepper@&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; The &quot;problem&quot;, or rather the thing missing, is 10:11:12.

I think the RMP is and will be very important in helping us out once we know what we&apos;re really looking for--i.e. what a &quot;guaranteed meantone successor&quot; might look like.  The fulminant interest in subgroups and essentially-tempered chords is encouraging, because it means we&apos;re finally past the &quot;music will evolve by increasing in scalar and harmonic complexity&quot; stage and conceding that music will evolve by branching in probably a few different dimensions simultaneously, probably most of which will not increase substantially in complexity but will instead probably swap out  some old elements for some new elements.  Maybe we&apos;ll go from the awesomely-simple 2.3.5.7.17.19 harmonies of 12-TET (Hendrix chord!  Minor 6th chord!  Don&apos;t get all &quot;there&apos;s no such thing as the 19-limit in 12-TET&quot; to me) to some equally-awesomely simple other subgroup.

And miracle&apos;s been on my list of<br/>&gt; &gt; things to figure out for a while too.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I guess Keenan only really looked at MOS&apos;s...maybe there is indeed a MODMOS out there that is as simple as meantone but more concordant? Perhaps even several?

If I want to play C augmented<br/>maj7, I&apos;ll play C lydian augmented (C D E F# G# A B C) or C lydian<br/>augmented #2 (C D# E F# G# A B C) or whatever. Each chord implies a<br/>range of modes, and each mode has its own &quot;feeling&quot; because the other<br/>notes can be used as &quot;extensions&quot; on top of your chosen chord. The<br/>modes commonly used are from the diatonic, melodic minor, harmonic<br/>minor, and harmonic major scales, as well as the diminished scale<br/>sometimes.</p><p>Well, except at first, that&apos;s not how it works. At first, a lot of<br/>modes just sound dumb, and like versions of things you know that have<br/>one note changed to not make sense. But once you hear a capable<br/>musician &quot;activate&quot; each mode with some trippy chord progression or<br/>voicing or what have you that only exists in that mode, you&apos;ll<br/>remember the sound forever. And in that way you can learn some sort of<br/>&quot;characteristic sound&quot; of each scale. That&apos;s how the MODMOS&apos;s are for<br/>other temperaments. They&apos;re going to all sound like stupid variations<br/>on the MOS until you realize that they each contain some chord/chord<br/>progression/sound/whatever that&apos;s only in that MODMOS, and then you&apos;ll<br/>realize what its &quot;sound&quot; is and what makes it unique, and start<br/>building a vocabulary, and so on. So the train of thought is</p><p>1) Think of chord you want to play<br/>2) Go to the database in your head of modes which contain that chord<br/>3) Play chord and as many other notes from that mode as you want - &quot;extensions&quot;<br/>4) Use the mode you chose for melody</p><p>So there isn&apos;t going to be a single MODMOS we all use, but that&apos;s<br/>fine.

I thought the 7-limit transition happened many decades ago,<br/>when jazz and blues musicians started using dom7 chords all over the<br/>place, taking advantage of the fact that 12-TET is both a Pajara and<br/>Meantone temperament (and thus also a Dominant temperament).&quot;</p><p>probably needs revising. For example, the German aug6 chord in<br/>quarter-comma meantone is 4:5:6:7, and far more accurate than it is in<br/>12-EDO, but it&apos;s about as unstable as a chord can get. So what does it<br/>mean to &quot;play 7-limit music?&quot; What&apos;s more 7-limit, the 12-EDO 4:5:6:7<br/>chord used as a tonic, or the 31-EDO 4:5:6:7 chord used as a German<br/>aug6 chord?

Mohaha/Maqamic and Bleu are both a lot closer to optimal in 17-TET than Porcupine is in 15-TET...and as you demonstrated yourself, the &quot;neutral 3rds&quot; heptatonic is the closest we get in the heptatonic range to meantone[7] for average dyadic HE (or do I misremember that?).</p><p>It&apos;s nothing more than personal preference that I prefer 10:11:12 to 12:13:14.

The idea of being able to play real major and minor chords, plus all this 11-limit stuff, in a circulating &quot;chromatic&quot; scale of only 15 notes is really exciting to me. That&apos;s part of why 8:10:11:12 is great to me, because it&apos;s something you can add on to a normal major chord which sounds really &quot;weird&quot; but still major and &quot;happy&quot; or whatever. The utonal &quot;minor&quot; version is also great. In contrast 8:12:13:14 still sounds otonal, but not &quot;major&quot;, if that makes sense.</p><p>As for average HE, porcupine[7] actually beats out neutral thirds [7] slightly for &quot;medium&quot; HE ( <a href="https://docs.google.com/open?id=0B9CMyeCjAMQGMDJlOTA3NmQtNDhkMy00NTYxLThjMTMtOTM2YTI2M2Q2YTE5">https://docs.google.com/open?id=0B9CMyeCjAMQGMDJlOTA3NmQtNDhkMy00NTYxLThjMTMtOTM2YTI2M2Q2YTE5</a> ).

The JI crowd has a longer history, a central focus around which to rally, and a better marketing strategy (it&apos;s hard to beat &quot;nature&apos;s perfect tuning, the purest of all, the standard by which all other tunings are judged&quot;, after all), and thus ends up with better performers, better resources to make recordings, and wider avenues to get their music to the public.</p><p>In any case, I could also say &quot;all of the above artists and styles vs. people actively and knowingly writing music based on alternative regular temperaments&quot;, too.

If you like<br/>&gt; 12:13:14, then neutral third scales and bleu are great, as you say, as well as negri<br/>&gt; (specifically this version: <a href="http://x31eq.com/cgi-bin/rt.cgi?ets=19_10&limit=2_3_5_7_13">http://x31eq.com/cgi-bin/rt.cgi?ets=19_10&limit=2_3_5_7_13</a> ).</p><p>Negri was maybe my favorite scale in 19-TET, though I suspect the MODMOS&apos;s of it would have proved even more magical.  I&apos;m starting to look at MODMOS&apos;s of Bleu[8]...they&apos;re pretty sweet, too.</p><p>For me, it&apos;s really a matter of finding a low ET (under 24-TET) that does as many novel things as possible as well as possible, but without entirely divorcing itself from everything familiar.  Since harmonics 7, 11, and 13 are the worst represented in 12-TET, but are significantly concordant in their own right, this makes them appealing as novel musical elements (duh, we&apos;ve all pretty much agreed on this ages ago).  Just looking at <a href="http://2.7.11.13">2.7.11.13</a>, 20-TET looks like the stand-out, but maybe pure novelty is a step too far, so adding back in the 3rd or 5th harmonic is probably wise.  On 2.3.7.11.13, 17-TET is a very clear winner, basically beating out everything until we get to 36.  On 2.5.7.11.13, we have 21-TET as the clear winner, but it&apos;s not as accurate on that subgroup as 17-TET is on 2.3.7.11.13 (and, let&apos;s face it, most people are probably more comforted by keeping around a solid 3/2 than a solid 5/4).  We could demand the full 13-limit, in which case 22-TET wins the day (oddly, given its poor approximations to all ratios of 13...but that&apos;s what Graham&apos;s app says), but we lose a lot of accuracy compared to the 5-less subgroup.  We could also demand less novelty, and say that the full 11-limit is enough, or even <a href="http://2.3.5.11">2.3.5.11</a>...this again points to 22, but even on the latter subgroup, the accuracy is not quite as good as 17-TET on the 2.3.7.11.13 subgroup (8.94 cents of adjusted error for 22, vs. 8.56 cents of adjusted error for 17-TET).  So 22-TET compared to 17-TET gives less novelty, less accuracy, and greater complexity.</p><p>OTOH, there&apos;s 19-TET on the <a href="http://2.3.5.13">2.3.5.13</a> subgroup, which is more accurate than 17 is on the 2.3.7.11.13 subgroup (~7.5 cents of adjusted error for 19-TET).  8:9:10:12:13 chords are pretty cool but you won&apos;t find them in any DE scale of reasonable size.  You gotta MODMOS Meantone or Sensi or Negri, really.  Less novelty, greater complexity, greater accuracy.</p><p>I think of the ETs under 24, 17 wins...but I also haven&apos;t looked at non-integer subgroups yet.</p><p>&gt; And call me conservative, but I&apos;m still really attached to 5-limit harmony. The idea of being &gt; able to play real major and minor chords, plus all this 11-limit stuff, in a circulating<br/>&gt; &quot;chromatic&quot; scale of only 15 notes is really exciting to me.</p><p>It&apos;s pretty cool, no doubt.  Have you compared it with George Secor&apos;s 17-WT?</p><p>&gt; That&apos;s part of why 8:10:11:12 is great to me, because it&apos;s something you can add on to a<br/>&gt; normal major chord which sounds really &quot;weird&quot; but still major and &quot;happy&quot; or whatever.<br/>&gt; The utonal &quot;minor&quot; version is also great. In contrast 8:12:13:14 still sounds otonal, but not &gt; &quot;major&quot;, if that makes sense.</p><p>Yeah, it does make sense.  I&apos;m probably just a bit less conservative, and willing to accept the approximately-septimal major and minor triads of 17-TET&apos;s diatonic scale (and/or those of Bleu, which are the same, basically) as &quot;close enough&quot; to 5-limit harmony to get across the same emotional effect if I want it to.  Compared to the 5-limit harmonies of 15-TET, I&apos;m not sure they&apos;re any less concordant...they might even be more concordant, actually.  Or at least the minor triads are.  Minor triads in 17-TET are gorgeous, easily my favorite of all the subminor-type triads found in ETs up to 24-TET.</p><p>One of the things I like about the 2.3.7.11.13 subgroup is you have these otonal concordant voicings for augmented and diminished chords--7:9:11 and 9:11:13.  That&apos;s pretty sweet to me.  Then throw the true fundamental on them to make 4:7:9:11 and 4:9:11:13 and see how they suddenly change.</p><p>&gt;The way I&apos;d charaterize it, though, is that meantone is the clear winner, and there are<br/>&gt; several runners up that are about equally good.</p><p>Yep, probably.  As an aside, have you ever considered re-doing the calculations according to the Vos-curve model of HE?</p><p>-Igs</p></div><h3>Carl Lumma &#x3C;carl@...&#x3E;</h3><span>1/3/2012 12:11:38 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- &quot;cityoftheasleep&quot; &lt;igliashon@...&gt; wrote:</p><p>&gt; Thanks for clarifying.

There<br/>are definitely other things we&apos;re not thinking of. There&apos;s a million<br/>things, in general.</p><p>The whole lump sum of what I wrote above can be thought of as cultural<br/>conditioning. What&apos;s the most important part?

But things<br/>like the 16-EDO example I gave, which you should try, really make me<br/>wonder if that&apos;s all there is to it. For example, to me, a stack of<br/>450 cent intervals is much less dissonant than a stack of 900 cent<br/>intervals. And to my ears, a stack of POTE sensi intervals is much<br/>less dissonant than a stack of POTE orwell intervals, because the<br/>latter is really dark and sounds like some kind of ultra-diminished<br/>chord, and the former sounds like wind and space and stuff. I don&apos;t<br/>see any psychoacoustic reason for that.</p><p>I do think that categorical perception is very similar to that sort of<br/>thing, except in my experience the thing you wrote above - that the<br/>sound of minor chords is sad and major is happy because of<br/>psychoacoustics - is as fragile as the hand you see in the mirror.</p><p>&gt; &gt; RMP is, by your own admission above, handling the aspect of music<br/>&gt; &gt; which is not the most important.

I&apos;m using &quot;diminished&quot; here to mean the smaller size of 7th<br/>that has been flattened by a chroma.</p><p>-Mike</p></div><h3>cityoftheasleep &#x3C;igliashon@...&#x3E;</h3><span>1/3/2012 5:55:25 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;Carl Lumma&quot; &lt;carl@...&gt; wrote:</p><p>&gt; We don&apos;t, that&apos;s why we make lists at each limit.  :)</p><p>I&apos;m hoping that subgroups will continue to gain attention.

At first blush you want to run out of the room screaming, but then you can relax into it.  How do you suppose that works?  I&apos;ll admit there are some wonky chords--the 738-cent intervals in particular--but I find it approximately as jarring as any of, say, Dante Rosati&apos;s guitar pieces, or anything written in Orwell[9].  Aside from those 738-cent intervals, I do not experience much if any discordance in this piece, unlike (say) Mike&apos;s Mavila retunings.  So I&apos;m kind of surprised by your reaction.</p><p>&gt; When I was in Portland in June I played one of your<br/>&gt; singles for a guitarist friend of mine.  He said he<br/>&gt; thought it sounded out of tune, not nice like the 22-tone<br/>&gt; choob he&apos;d played some months earlier.  I wish I could<br/>&gt; remember which piece it was.</p><p>Well, I can top that.  I demonstrated 19-EDO to a guitarist friend of fine, and he thought it sounded out of tune...and then I demonstrated 16-EDO, and he thought it sounded normal as all get-out.  He couldn&apos;t see what the big deal was, really.  After I let him mess around on both guitars, he said he like 16-EDO the best.</p><p>&gt; For RMS (TE) error the reason why it&apos;s wrong is slightly more complicated.  The<br/>&gt; TOP-max and TOP-RMS 7-limit errors are both higher for<br/>&gt; 19-ET than for 22-ET.</p><p>How are you doing the error calculations?  And is there a way to make Graham&apos;s app spit out the pure-octave error calculations?  I&apos;m gonna have to re-do all those damn subgroup calculations if what you say is correct.</p><p>&gt; &gt; That&apos;s a shame.  I might as well have kept writing in 12, then.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I like the weirdness of the melodies.  It&apos;s refreshing,<br/>&gt; and it more than pays for the blackboard-scratching<br/>&gt; harmonies.  But systems with more accurate harmony have<br/>&gt; weird melodic potentials too...</p><p>It&apos;s not accuracy my music is lacking, per se.  It&apos;s accuracy in the 3- or 5-limit.  Typically I use systems where harmonics 7, 11, and/or 13 are tuned quite accurate (see 16-ED2, 13-ED2, 20-ED2/10-ED2, 17-ED2; or 23-ED2, which doesn&apos;t tune hardly any harmonics accurately but does tune lots of 7, 11, and 13-limit intervals accurately--9/4, 7/6, 7/5, 6/5, 5/3, 11/7, 11/6, 11/5, 13/6, 13/4, etc.).  I suspect you just have a coarser ear than I for discordance--a high &quot;s&quot; as far as dyadic HE is concerned.</p><p>&gt; Hooray!  The only thing I can suggest is to experiment<br/>&gt; with new intonational systems about 15% of the time.<br/>&gt; I think you&apos;ve done that.  From our past discussions, it<br/>&gt; doesn&apos;t seem like you&apos;re really attracted to the sound<br/>&gt; of JI, so the systems you choose are probably right<br/>&gt; for you.  That said, if you&apos;ve never tried writing 3-part<br/>&gt; counterpoint in meantone or porcupine or pajara, you<br/>&gt; might enjoy the exercise.</p><p>Meantone (19-EDO):<br/><a href="http://soundcloud.com/cityoftheasleep/stagnant-deity">http://soundcloud.com/cityoftheasleep/stagnant-deity</a></p><p>Porcupine[8] (in 22-EDO):<br/><a href="http://soundcloud.com/cityoftheasleep/porcupiano">http://soundcloud.com/cityoftheasleep/porcupiano</a></p><p>Superpyth[12] (not stingy with 5-limit harmonies):<br/><a href="http://soundcloud.com/cityoftheasleep/superpythwaltz22">http://soundcloud.com/cityoftheasleep/superpythwaltz22</a></p><p>Injera[12] (empasizing as many 7-limit tetrads as I could figure out how to finger on piano):<br/><a href="http://soundcloud.com/cityoftheasleep/two-pairs-of-socks">http://soundcloud.com/cityoftheasleep/two-pairs-of-socks</a></p><p>A 5-limit 8-note diatonic-like subset of Helmholtz[12] in 29-EDO:<br/><a href="http://soundcloud.com/cityoftheasleep/howling-of-the-holy">http://soundcloud.com/cityoftheasleep/howling-of-the-holy</a></p><p>Augene[12] in 27-EDO:<br/><a href="http://soundcloud.com/cityoftheasleep/sad-like-winter-trees">http://soundcloud.com/cityoftheasleep/sad-like-winter-trees</a></p><p>Happy now?</p><p>I still think all of these sound boring and dull compared to my 10-EDO shred-fests:<br/><a href="http://soundcloud.com/cityoftheasleep/dirty-hands">http://soundcloud.com/cityoftheasleep/dirty-hands</a><br/><a href="http://soundcloud.com/cityoftheasleep/anglebath">http://soundcloud.com/cityoftheasleep/anglebath</a></p><p>-Igs</p></div><h3>genewardsmith &#x3C;genewardsmith@...&#x3E;</h3><span>1/3/2012 6:43:00 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;cityoftheasleep&quot; &lt;igliashon@...&gt; wrote:</p><p>&gt; That&apos;s very interesting.

If<br/>you have half the primes flat and half sharp, meaning things like 15/1<br/>are better than 5/3, then there&apos;s less room for optimization as pure<br/>octaves are already about the ideal stretch, which yields a higher<br/>error.

The category of the third makes this easy.<br/>&gt;&gt; Any good scale lets you create alternating harmony by<br/>&gt;&gt; mixing scale degrees... the diatonic property, on the<br/>&gt;&gt; other hand, is quite rare (at least if you want good<br/>&gt;&gt; tuning accuracy).<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I started this a while ago:<br/>&gt; <a href="http://xenharmonic.wikispaces.com/Consonant+class+scale">http://xenharmonic.wikispaces.com/Consonant+class+scale</a><br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Keenan<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; ------------------------------------<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; You can configure your subscription by sending an empty email to one<br/>&gt; of these addresses (from the address at which you receive the list):<br/>&gt;   <a href="mailto:tuning-subscribe@yahoogroups.com">tuning-subscribe@yahoogroups.com</a> - join the tuning group.<br/>&gt;   <a href="mailto:tuning-unsubscribe@yahoogroups.com">tuning-unsubscribe@yahoogroups.com</a> - leave the group.<br/>&gt;   <a href="mailto:tuning-nomail@yahoogroups.com">tuning-nomail@yahoogroups.com</a> - turn off mail from the group.<br/>&gt;   <a href="mailto:tuning-digest@yahoogroups.com">tuning-digest@yahoogroups.com</a> - set group to send daily digests.<br/>&gt;   <a href="mailto:tuning-normal@yahoogroups.com">tuning-normal@yahoogroups.com</a> - set group to send individual emails.<br/>&gt;   <a href="mailto:tuning-help@yahoogroups.com">tuning-help@yahoogroups.com</a> - receive general help information.<br/>&gt; Yahoo!

Otherwise the basic requirement is<br/>&gt;&gt; simply 3 independent melodies combining to form harmony.<br/>&gt;&gt; I was messing with that with NO clue of theory when I figured out how to<br/>&gt;&gt; use two cassette decks to overdub.<br/>&gt;&gt; Countless bands have done it in one fashion or another. Is it florid<br/>&gt;&gt; Renaissance counterpoint, pretty much no, but it still IS counterpoint.<br/>&gt;&gt; Contrapuntal writing is extremely ingrained in western music tradition.<br/>&gt;&gt; Its been diluted in many cases but it still is there.<br/>&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt; And lets not forget Jazz - where the counterpoint is being made up on the<br/>&gt;&gt; spot.<br/>&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt; Chris<br/>&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt;</p></div>
