Maybe I need to get a hold of the Boston 72 school&apos;s<br/>materials as I find it very  time consuming to devise my own exercises.</p><p>&gt; My view is that neither the ET view nor the JI view capture much of<br/>&gt; what is aesthetically relevant about these scales. They&apos;re simply a<br/>&gt; matter of tradition, experience, learning, practice, and expression.<br/>&gt; One sees identical tetrachords of various constructions, and subtle<br/>&gt; inflections. One can attempt to quantify them in various ways, but<br/>&gt; there&apos;s no reason to assume that this quantification captures much of<br/>&gt; what is aesthetically relevant in the experience of this music<br/>&gt; itself. The music doesn&apos;t employ 7-limit tetradic harmonies, nor does<br/>&gt; it modulate to 72 tonal centers. Thus neither the 7LJI nor the 72-tET<br/>&gt; paradigms is very close, conceptually, to what goes on &quot;behind&quot; the<br/>&gt; music. Just my opinion.</p><p>I agree with that excellent conclusion. It struck me though that despite what I said about the<br/>conservatism and control structure of the Orthodox Church, perhaps they don&apos;t really know of the<br/>finer details musically speaking. I think that some of the points that have been raised in this<br/>discussion by yourself and others should be of great interest to the upper echelons of the<br/>church&apos;s hierarchy in view of the fact that they (the Church) are greatly concerned with the<br/>&quot;correct&quot; tones - to quote John Tavener during a BBC interview.</p><p>Best Wishes</p></div><h3>jpehrson@rcn.com</h3><span>8/31/2001 5:45:44 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In tuning@y..., Alison Monteith &lt;alison.monteith3@w...&gt; wrote:</p><p><a href="http://groups.yahoo.com/group/tuning/message/27713">http://groups.yahoo.com/group/tuning/message/27713</a></p><p>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Paul Erlich wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; Aren&apos;t you the same Alison who doubted that one could even sing<br/>the<br/>&gt; &gt; difference between adjacent degrees in 72-tET?
