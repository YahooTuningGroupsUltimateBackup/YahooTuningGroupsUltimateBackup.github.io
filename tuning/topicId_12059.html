This is<br/>the reason that I love the Just tunings so much! You may remember an<br/>earlier post from me in which I was saying how I observed other<br/>musician&apos;s approach to Just tunings for the first time. This is<br/>exactly what they were doing and what I love to do all the time<br/>is &quot;revel in the idiosyncrasies&quot; of the Just Scales. There is<br/>something so beautiful about the varying size scale steps. The fact<br/>that this is predominantly found in the tuning systems of so<br/>called &quot;Ethnic Musics&quot; of the World, where the ear dictates what<br/>sounds right, must lend some validation to the use of the Just Ratios<br/>(or scales of unequal step sizes).</p><p>&gt;<br/>&gt; I guess my question is VERY general, but I was interested in<br/>peoples&apos;<br/>&gt; reactions concerning equal temperament.  If the UNEQUAL<br/>temperaments<br/>&gt; are so interesting in their idiosyncrasies, why is it so imperative<br/>&gt; to even WANT to use equal temperaments??</p><p>This is the kind of question that I asked myself in the late 80s,<br/>when I turned (permanently) to Just Intonation as my personal<br/>preference. Equal Temperament practice seems to be predominantly<br/>concerned with approximating the Just Intervals, but providing stable<br/>equal intervals for modulation. I have always preferred a &quot;take what<br/>nature gives&quot; approach. My whole approach to tuning comes from this.</p><p>&gt;<br/>&gt; I understand the history of transposition, modulation and so<br/>forth...<br/>&gt; but are people really going to want to &quot;modulate&quot; in traditional<br/>(or<br/>&gt; even untraditional!) ways in non 12-tET systems?  If so... who on<br/>&gt; this list has had experience with non-12-tempered ET&apos;s within the<br/>&gt; realm of transposition and modulation??</p><p>Many times in my Just Intonation compositions, I&apos;m not really<br/>concerned with modulation - at least in the Equal Temperament sense,<br/>and I find it works out Just fine for me to modulate within the scale<br/>structure that I&apos;m using at the moment - and as you would imagine,<br/>there are always the subjectively best modulations in a given JI<br/>system. If I remember correctly, Harry Partch also found that it<br/>worked well for him too. Hey - if harmonic entropy shows us that the<br/>ear makes certain allowances in perception of intervals, then there<br/>is a veritable infinity of resources in the modulations of JI.</p><p>&gt;<br/>&gt; I understand that whatever characteristic is present in one &quot;key&quot;<br/>of<br/>&gt; such an equal system is just as &quot;good&quot; or &quot;bad&quot; as in<br/>another &quot;key.&quot;<br/>&gt; Whoopie.  However, one would NEVER find the purity of certain<br/>&gt; intervals that could be present at certain points, which would be<br/>&gt; discovered by a composer-- by the way -- in a just system (??)</p><p>IMO there is rarely a better substitute than using the Just<br/>Intervals - except for (but not that its&apos; necessarily better), as we<br/>all know, when you go to higher and higher prime divisions of the<br/>octave (53 tET and such), and then you must deal with unwieldy<br/>keyboard mappings, or choosing some subset of a large nTET - so for<br/>me - the best and most beautiful solution is to use the very thing<br/>that Equal Temperaments are trying to be - JUST. An observation I<br/>have long noticed with the Just method, is that the 1/1 tonal key<br/>center seems always implied in a Just system, even when you are using<br/>chords/melodies not containing the &quot;root&quot; (this must have something<br/>to do with Mr. Erlich&apos;s harmonic entropy - or just plain old tonal<br/>gravity, but I&apos;m at this point unqualified to show the mathematical<br/>proof). Undoubtedly though, there is something very beautiful about<br/>tuning up your instruments, and exploring the modulatory<br/>possibilities of a closed set of pitches.</p><p>&gt;<br/>&gt; Have alternate equal temperaments been successful for you?? and are<br/>&gt; they WORTH the evening out of all the intervals and their special<br/>&gt; characteristics in order to achieve it??</p><p>As stated above, I experimented with many different TETs in the first<br/>couple of years of my microtonal tuning experience, to find that I<br/>love and prefer the just logic. Sometimes I feel that this does not<br/>resonate with all here (note that not one person commented on my post<br/>about my 13 Tone Just Intonation system), but here I must agree with<br/>Dan Stearns - there is no reason to narrow the field of choices that<br/>are available to us all that have chosen to be on the vanguard of<br/>microtonal tuning in the 21st Century.</p><p>&gt;<br/>&gt; Any commentary or suggestions would be greatly appreciated.</p><p>How about this: I really dig your music!<br/>&gt;</p><p>Yours Truly,</p><p>Jacky Ligon</p></div><h3><a id=12066 href="#12066">ðŸ”—</a>Joseph Pehrson &#x3C;pehrson@pubmedia.com&#x3E;</h3><span>8/30/2000 11:29:07 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@egroups.com">tuning@egroups.com</a>, &quot;Jacky Ligon&quot; &lt;jacky_ekstasis@y...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt; --- In <a href="mailto:tuning@egroups.com">tuning@egroups.com</a>, &quot;Joseph Pehrson&quot; &lt;pehrson@p...&gt; wrote:</p><p><a href="http://www.egroups.com/message/tuning/12064">http://www.egroups.com/message/tuning/12064</a></p><p>&gt; As stated above, I experimented with many different TETs in the<br/>first<br/>&gt; couple of years of my microtonal tuning experience, to find that I<br/>&gt; love and prefer the just logic.</p><p>Thank you so much Jacky for your observations (and compliments!) and<br/>perceptions of your experiences.

Have alternate equal temperaments been successful for you??<br/>&gt; and are they WORTH the evening out of all the intervals and their<br/>&gt; special characteristics in order to achieve it??</p><p>Hi Joe.  I don&apos;t really have answers to your questions, just<br/>a couple of comments from my own experience.</p><p>One of the main reasons I got so interested in just-intonation<br/>is the variability of interval-size you get in a closed system<br/>of pitches, where often a variety of specific ratios would all<br/>fall collectively under one intervallic _gestalt_.</p><p>I find it attractive that, say, an important motive can appear<br/>in one part of a piece with a &apos;pure major 3rd&apos; of 5/4 in it,<br/>and at another place where the same motive occurs you can<br/>use a &apos;neutral 3rd&apos; 11/9 for variation, and so on.</p><p>From time to time, I retune one of my old 12-tET pieces into JI,<br/>and while most of the retuning follows the dictum of the closest<br/>&apos;traditional&apos; 5- or 7-limit harmonies, I never fail to exploit<br/>some of the &apos;weirder&apos; intervals, on purpose.  Look around on my<br/>&apos;Worklist&apos; webpage for examples.</p><p>I can also agree with much of what Jacky Ligon said in his<br/>response to you:<br/><a href="http://www.egroups.com/message/tuning/12064">http://www.egroups.com/message/tuning/12064</a></p><p>but my exposure to many thought-provoking ideas here on this<br/>List (primarily stemming from Paul Erlich&apos;s unbelievably consistent<br/>logic) has forced me to reconsider many ideas about temperament.<br/>(I have a &apos;24-eq tune&apos; on my site too, if you&apos;d like to hear<br/>something I&apos;ve done with strict quartertones - some people here<br/>really liked this little piece, Carl Lumma in particular.)</p><p>So in addition to my general preference for JI, and for<br/>temperaments that approximate it, I&apos;d have to say that I find<br/>ETs musically useful too.</p><p>An equal-temerament has its own characteristic overall &apos;mood&apos;<br/>that becomes apparent while playing around with its various<br/>pitches.  This too can be musically useful.  As you note, ETs<br/>are far different from well-temperaments, meantones, and other<br/>uneven temperaments in this respect.</p><p>&gt; [Dan Stearns]<br/>&gt; <a href="http://www.egroups.com/message/tuning/12060">http://www.egroups.com/message/tuning/12060</a><br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I personally tend to use a lot of equal tunings simply for the<br/>&gt; beauty and musical usefulness (as I see it) inherent in them,<br/>&gt; and a lot of these are by no means even best seen as<br/>&gt; &quot;temperaments&quot;; i.e., 11, 13, 20, (etc.). I think this is an<br/>&gt; important distinction that you might not be taking into<br/>&gt; consideration. I also occasionally use some unusual equal<br/>&gt; temperaments in the usual sense; i.e., to achieve a greater<br/>&gt; degree of a certain desirable JI paradigm while at the same time<br/>&gt; tempering out another not so desirable condition of that JI<br/>&gt; paradigm (see the recent 5L4s, 9-tone posts)..<br/>&gt;</p><p>In fact, around the end of last year (you may have missed this),<br/>we on this list came up with a broad classification of tunings:<br/><a href="http://www.egroups.com/message/tuning/7343">http://www.egroups.com/message/tuning/7343</a></p><p>Unfortunately, I myself have contributed to confusion by ignoring<br/>the advice I gave myself here:</p><p><a href="http://www.egroups.com/message/tuning/7346">http://www.egroups.com/message/tuning/7346</a></p><p>and indiscreetly mixing the use of 12-EDO and 12-tET on my website.<br/>One of these days I&apos;ll have to clean all this up.</p><p>Carl Lumma suggested an alternative system:</p><p><a href="http://www.egroups.com/message/tuning/7372">http://www.egroups.com/message/tuning/7372</a></p><p>Look around in the archives all around these messages; there<br/>were quite a few interesting comments about this subject.</p><p>I highly recommend getting acquainted with the work of Ivor Darreg,<br/>Easley Blackwood, Dan Stearns, and Brian McLaren for a glimpse into<br/>this &apos;ET universe&apos;.  All four of them have CDs and tapes of their<br/>music, and much written material as well (McLaren and especially<br/>Darreg have been particularly prolific as writers; alas, the past<br/>tense is necessary when speaking of Darreg as he passed away a<br/>few years ago).</p><p>While Blackwood&apos;s approach seems to me to be primarily founded<br/>on the approximations various ETs have to various just intervals,<br/>Darreg&apos;s approach was based more on exploring particular ET &apos;moods&apos;<br/>without so much reference to their JI implications (altho he<br/>did talk about that too).  McLaren and Stearns are pretty much<br/>coming from this angle too.</p><p>As far as I know, Darreg was the first music-theorist to really<br/>discuss the idea of individual &apos;moods&apos; for various ETs, outside<br/>of older research that more closely followed Blackwood&apos;s type<br/>of approach.</p><p>I know Blackwood&apos;s _The Structure of Recognizable Diatonic Tunings_<br/>is out-of-print, but you&apos;ll have no problem finding it at a<br/>library (or used book store?) in New York.  I&apos;m not sure about<br/>the status of the CD/tape of his landmark _Microtonal Etudes_<br/>- others on the List can probably help you; I found a copy of<br/>the CD at a library in Philadelphia.</p><p>Darreg&apos;s CD _Detwelvulate_ is available.  I think Frog Peak has<br/>it, and we have a few copies here at Sonic Arts.</p><p>You can write to McLaren; any interest you show in microtonal<br/>music will prompt him to send you generous packages of his own CDs<br/>and articles. (He&apos;s also very dedicated to spreading info about,<br/>and music by, Darreg.)</p><p>Dan Stearns is on this List and has mp3s on the Tuning Punks site;<br/>he&apos;s very open to extensive theorizing about his work, both<br/>privately and on-List.  (In fact, Dan, it would be nice to have<br/>your theoretical writings collected somewhere, either in print or<br/>on a website.  It would certainly help me to follow your complex<br/>thoughts better.)</p><p>Another thing Dan Stearns, Ezra Sims, and myself all find very<br/>useful about ETs is their notational transparency.  We all agree<br/>(and so does Paul Erlich) that 72-tET is exrememly good for<br/>representing a very broad set of JI tunings.  Sims uses 72-tET<br/>to represent a very complex 37-limit JI, while Erlich&apos;s analysis<br/>of its &apos;consistency&apos; gives him a more conservative view (IIRC,<br/>72-tET &apos;works&apos; up to the 11-limit; correct me if I&apos;m wrong, Paul).</p><p>Stearns has invented a very simple modification of 72-tET notation<br/>into 144-tET, which I also found extremely useful.  Stearns<br/>likes it for its ability to &apos;accurately&apos; represent many different<br/>smaller ETs which are all being used simultaneously, and I like<br/>because of its good approximations of very complex JI systems.<br/>Erlich doesn&apos;t like it because it offers added notational<br/>complexity but no improvement in consistency over 72-tET.

Don&apos;t be bored, be fascinated, mesmerized. This<br/>sensibility opens the door for the more complex symmetrical forces<br/>hidden inside the Trojan horse of equal temperament.&quot;</p><p>&gt; The fact that this is predominantly found in the tuning systems of<br/>so called &quot;Ethnic Musics&quot; of the World, where the ear dictates what<br/>sounds right, must lend some validation to the use of the Just Ratios<br/>(or scales of unequal step sizes).</p><p>Those two can certainly be quite different things though; just ratios<br/>and unequal step sizes.</p><p>&gt; I have always preferred a &quot;take what nature gives&quot; approach. My<br/>whole approach to tuning comes from this.</p><p>Though I may not always agree with the rhetoric, I&apos;ll always defend<br/>the choices of even the staunchest of JI advocates, or ET opponents<br/>(where it&apos;s hard to imagine anyone outdoing Partch&apos;s example for<br/>perspicacity and derision -- wit and spit that is!). Because after<br/>all, these are their choices to make, and certainly it&apos;s sometimes<br/>very hard to argue with the strength of aural causality (or a<br/>teleological persuasion) when it comes to JI... but I can think of<br/>many instances where the subtle or gross distinctions between tuning<br/>and music makes the whole argument or discussion a lot more complex.<br/>One of my favorite analogies would have music as &quot;engineering&quot; and<br/>tuning as &quot;nature,&quot; say the early inventors who were trying to emulate<br/>nature in an attempt to master flight; emulating nature -- i.e.,<br/>birds -- just wasn&apos;t the best model/mindset for the particular job at<br/>hand! &quot;If you want to make something that flies, flapping your wings<br/>is not the way to do it. You bolt a 400-horsepower engine to a barn<br/>door, that&apos;s how you fly. You can look at birds forever and never<br/>discover this secret.&quot;</p><p>Well the same goes for music in some instances. Where for one, you<br/>could see something like tempering (say meantone for instance) as a<br/>really profound solution to a particular musical problem. In this<br/>sense, seeing this as a &quot;compromise&quot; is more of a particular viewpoint<br/>than any sort of fundamental opus contra naturam.</p><p>For me, Carl Seashore really hit the proverbial &apos;distinction nail&apos; on<br/>the head when he wrote that our profoundest appreciation&apos;s of nature<br/>and art are detachments from the physically exact, and that they<br/>constitute a synthesis through the medium of normal illusions... that<br/>when in comes to musical art, in a certain important sense, all is<br/>illusion:</p><p>&quot;Without the blessing of normal illusions, musical art would be<br/>hopelessly stunted&quot;... &quot;If there where a one-to-one relationship<br/>between the physical sound and the mental experience or response which<br/>it illicits, our problem would be simplified. However, these<br/>relationships scarcely if ever exist.&quot;</p><p>&gt; so for me - the best and most beautiful solution is to use the very<br/>thing that Equal Temperaments are trying to be - JUST.</p><p>I sure can&apos;t argue with the first point! But I just don&apos;t think that<br/>the second one is true... true enough, you certainly can argue a ratio<br/>to fraction of the octave interpretation for any equal division,<br/>perhaps even a logical tempering scheme, but there&apos;s more than a<br/>little something to Ivor Darreg&apos;s personality (or &quot;mood&quot;) argument --<br/>especially when it comes to the lower numbered, or even like families,<br/>of equal divisions.</p><p>Alternate tunings?

I would humbly<br/>like to state that I&apos;m a perpetual student of tuning theory and<br/>practice, and anything I say today may be shaken by the next thing I<br/>learn - which may in turn guide me into new areas of microtonal bliss<br/>(please note that I constantly try out different tunings and never<br/>seem to settle for just one thing only - even though it is somewhat<br/>appealing to me to work with a system long enough to really<br/>internalize it&apos;s strengths and weaknesses). I came to this list on<br/>the recommendation of Joe Monzo - and honestly - with great humility<br/>and a spirit of wanting to learn from all of the other points of view<br/>that are represented here. In this spirit of humility, I am<br/>absolutely unable to have anything even remotely resembling a dogma<br/>about tuning, as it would be in direct conflict with my attitude of<br/>wanting to absorb as much as humanly possible from all of those much<br/>wiser than myself. My only regret is that I didn&apos;t come here to learn<br/>from all of you friends 3 years ago when I was able to scrape up<br/>enough money to get my first computer and private internet access. I<br/>can&apos;t begin to explain in mere words how it has - in just a brief<br/>time - enhanced my music making.

It has for the longest time made sense<br/>for my own practices to use the ratios rather than the approximations<br/>offered in equal temperaments, but I have also experienced the great<br/>beauty found in making music with a number of ntets. And if I, in my<br/>own way understand a bit of what Ivor means when he referred<br/>to &quot;moods&quot;; it must be the ineffable emotional quality of any tuning<br/>that makes it a unique sound unto itself - something we experience<br/>like the sun rising or the force of gravity - but can only discuss in<br/>the abstractions of mathematics or the symbols of language. This has<br/>so many rich and infinite possibilities for making beautiful music -<br/>and I would never advocate any frozen way of doing things.

I want to mention that I read something in a<br/>book about Acoustics a few years ago, that the subtle and not so<br/>subtle physical differences in the inner ears of human beings causes<br/>a great range of different kinds of perceptions of music - I will try<br/>to track down this information tonight. So it could be that many of<br/>us are hearing different things and appreciate (and have affinities<br/>for) so many myriad of various tuning systems, because of these very<br/>physical differences. You know, this is so analogous to Sub-Atomic<br/>Physics too - because of the different ways that you can &quot;look&quot; at<br/>sub-atomic matter actually effect what you see. In other words, what<br/>is perceived is only as good as the mechanism of perception, and or<br/>the way of perceiving and analyzing the results of the data<br/>perceived.</p><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@egroups.com">tuning@egroups.com</a>, &quot;Joseph Pehrson&quot; &lt;pehrson@p...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; This is funny.

Our procedures go thru &apos;seasonal&apos;<br/>and &apos;meteorological&apos; changes.</p><p>Many, many times, I&apos;ve done a bit of constructing to get<br/>an initial inspiration for a piece, then keep it mainly<br/>in the background as the composition of the piece progresses<br/>and the auditory logic takes on a life of its own.</p><p>I&apos;ve used this metaphor here before, and many others have<br/>before me (composers like Beethoven and Mahler, for instance):<br/>composing a piece can be very much like raising a child.<br/>These two composers both used the &apos;birthing&apos; metaphor,<br/>but (braach, braach, braach) I&apos;m too chicken to risk<br/>offending any feminists out there by making that claim<br/>myself, so I&apos;ll just say &apos;raising&apos;.  But my point is, there&apos;s<br/>a kind of &apos;nature vs. nurture&apos; dichotomy going on here too.<br/>Just as in the issue of raising offspring, there&apos;s lots of<br/>room in between those two extremes, and most likely, the<br/>best way is to be found within that area of flexibility.</p><p>(A worthwhile digression here:  The issue of the importance<br/>of flexibility in many facets of life was really brought<br/>home to me a long time ago when I read Gregory Bateson&apos;s<br/>_Steps to an Ecology of Mind_.  This is a *fantastic* book<br/>that I heartily recommend to anyone interested in metaphysical<br/>stuff.)</p><p>(Another digression: One of the reasons I keep extolling the<br/>value and beauty of the internet, is that the liberal exchange<br/>of information seems to be the best way to foster this<br/>attitude of encompassing flexibility.
