At first I<br/>wanted to tune to a Blackjack octave plus some extra tones. Armed with a<br/>Peterson Virtual strobe tuner and an ASR 10 and TX 802 both tuned to<br/>Blackjack and set to chime patches, I thought this would be easy enough.<br/>Not so.</p><p>We talk a lot on this list about the inharmonic partials of steel tubes,<br/>but I wonder how many of you have really listened over a few days to<br/>metal bars being struck and attempted to cut and file to precise cent<br/>measurements. Some days I hear the fundamental and the tuner picks up an<br/>alien partial. Other days it&apos;s the other way round. Then the temperature<br/>changes, the bars cool and I&apos;m 10 cents out. I realised that my original<br/>ambition of cutting 36 tubes to Blackjack plus some would have to wait<br/>till I owned an engineer&apos;s shop.</p><p>Strings on the other hand are so simple. Good solid overtones nicely<br/>lined up from the zithers, tunable equally easily by ear and by machine.</p><p>So I can work in Blackjack with zithers and psalteries and have devised<br/>methods of working with voices.</p><p>Blackjack&apos;s voice leading resources are indeed inspiring. For those of<br/>you who like improvising I would recommend the two hexanies &apos;joined at<br/>the hip&apos; on G-D. I have regular sessions now with other musicians and we<br/>never tire of these atonal structures, particularly if the basic tones<br/>are enhanced by the added articulation resources of the zithers.</p><p>So what am I doing with the bars? I started with a mixture of Lou<br/>Harrison&apos;s slendro pentatonics. First &quot;Si Aptos&quot;; 1/1 , 8/7, 4/3, 3/2,<br/>7/4, 2/1. It took me about 12 hours hard labour to cut and tune eight<br/>3/4 inch steel tubes to these ratios. Some of that time was spent<br/>drilling holes in the tubes to tune the air column to the fundamental<br/>and that really does make a difference. I look forward to adding<br/>resonators and designing a stand.  I added a 7/6 and a 12/7 which gives<br/>me the &quot;Mills&quot; tuning and a couple of other options. I&apos;ll do a 9/7 soon<br/>and colour code the different pentatonic options. There is something<br/>special, to my ears at least, about the low number superparticular<br/>ratios between these tones.</p><p>Working in Equal Temperaments has advantages but it&apos;s like acquainting<br/>yourself with men in grey suits on their way to the financial markets.<br/>With Just Intonation you have them in for dinner and a frolic in the<br/>jacuzzi.</p><p>Moving on I looked at the possibilites for expanding into tetrachordal<br/>territory. Naturally, John Chalmer&apos;s &apos;Divisions&apos; is my Bible here. I<br/>intend having the pentatonics with 11, 13, 17 and 19 limit options for<br/>tetrachords. Then I want to have two related hexanies on strings and the<br/>harmonic canon I&apos;m planning will be tuned to an eikosany. By sheer<br/>chance my &quot;anger reduction bars&quot; (two L-section pieces iron used as<br/>anchors for hauling engines out of cars) are a near perfect 3/2 and a<br/>7/4 with my A440 &apos;tonic&apos;.</p><p>I know that somebody&apos;s going to point out that I could use such-and-such<br/>ET to approximate these tunings. Fine, but with most of the JI tones I<br/>can physically &apos;feel&apos; when they&apos;re right, which helps tuning greatly.<br/>And I&apos;m of the opinion that the ear tolerates more &apos;slack&apos; with JI tuned<br/>bars. (Queue up for a flameproof suit) I &apos;d love to hear from anyone who<br/>has managed to tune up complex ETs with wood or steel bars.</p><p>Did you ever wonder why we in the UK never get round to making Partch<br/>type wooden instruments? It&apos;s simple - we don&apos;t have trees big enough<br/>for big 1/4 sawn tops and we don&apos;t have the weather for the right kind<br/>of tree growth. Y&apos;all have it nice with your redwoods and cedars. The<br/>best I can get lacally is Douglas Fir and even then I&apos;ll have to<br/>laminate to make big tops. I only learned to spell laminate last week so<br/>you can see where I&apos;m at. Even the spring tempered rods for my bass<br/>mbira come from Chicago.</p><p>I&apos;ll get some sound files up soon - promise.</p><p>Regards</p></div><h3><a id=34835 href="#34835">ðŸ”—</a>genewardsmith &#x3C;genewardsmith@juno.com&#x3E;</h3><span>2/25/2002 11:36:33 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In tuning@y..., Alison Monteith &lt;alison.monteith3@w...&gt; wrote:</p><p>&gt; Did you ever wonder why we in the UK never get round to making Partch<br/>&gt; type wooden instruments?

You start by drilling evenly  spaced small holes ( 2-3 depending on<br/>tube length, best check the book ) in the tube, a tricky job at times.

I&apos;ve found by<br/>comparing drilled and undrilled tubes that the drilled tubes have a far more pleasing tone, richer<br/>and rounder perhaps.
