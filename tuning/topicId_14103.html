ET will<br/>equate intervals which have distinct expressions in terms of reiterations<br/>of the generator.  For instance, in 12-tET a minor third and aug. 2nd are<br/>equivalent, but in Kornerup tuning they are well distinguished, but not so<br/>much that they threaten the distinction between, say, min and maj thirds.<br/>Whether Kornerup tuning is a maximum distinction across the board I suppose<br/>depends on how you define maximum distinction, but intuitively I think it<br/>would, with a reasonable definition requiring distinctions of every<br/>interval formed by a different number of generator reiterations, prove a<br/>maximum distinction.  Is that accurate?</p></div><h3>Paul H.
