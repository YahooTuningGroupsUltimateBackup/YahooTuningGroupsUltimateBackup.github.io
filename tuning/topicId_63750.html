Can someone give an example of a 7-limit JI scale (.scl syntax)? I found harm7limit.scl, but when normalized it miss a good minor 9th, a good perfect 4th...</p><p>Concerning to &quot;xenharmophobia&quot;, there are many interfering causes.</p><p>Here are my 2 cents:</p><p>Intervals like 7/6, 7/5 etc. can be considered consonant when isolated, but the same intervals can be considered &quot;out of tune&quot; in certain contexts.</p><p>For me, when the lower pitch (of an interval) is contextually a root (fundamental) tone, I find 5/4 quite well tuned. But I cannot accept 9/7 as &quot;well tuned&quot; until I can recognize it as a &quot;high harmony&quot; it is -- the lower pitch is *not* a fundamental tone, but a 7th harmonic.</p><p>Another interesting comparation is between aug.4th and dim.5th from 19-ET. Both can sound detuned until one can understand them.</p><p>The relation between material and context is also very important. For example, there are microtonal music pieces which are not &quot;really&quot; (in its essence) microtonal, but convencional tonal western music with a few &quot;add-ons&quot;, instead. &quot;Perfect&quot; triads in 15-ET, for example, sounds horribly out of tune, because they are similar to that old and well known material, but distorted and off context. Neoclassic music in 15-ET probably sounds &quot;wrong&quot;. So, if your scale have no tuned 3rds and 5ths, forget triads! Use other more characteristic (scale specific) intervals and chords.</p><p>Still there is the case of people who have &quot;perfect pitch&quot;. If they are limited to 12-ET, alternative tunings possibly sound out of tune for such people. (By the other side, it seems that Alois H&iuml;&iquest;&half;ba, an important microtonalist, had &quot;perfect pitch&quot;.)</p><p>Regards,<br/>Hudson</p><p>P.S.:</p><p>To 12-EDO reluctant listeners, try the following:</p><p>0) Use only (synthesised) perfectly harmonic timbres (organ-like), without vibrato or other effects; the sound should be nice, however.<br/>1) Generate some tunings of the major triad: from JI, 12-EDO and 1/4 comma meantone. Include also a bad meantone degree&apos;s (Db?) major triad. (Transpose all triads to the same root.)<br/>2) Play the probe triads to the listeners, and ask them to sort the triads according to the deegree of consonance they perceive.<br/>3) Tell them what is the tuning for each triad.</p><p>This experiment can be an interesting introduction to tunings and microtonalism.</p><p>--<br/>Hudson Lacerda &lt;<a href="http://geocities.yahoo.com.br/hfmlacerda/">http://geocities.yahoo.com.br/hfmlacerda/</a>&gt;<br/>*N&iuml;&iquest;&half;o deixe seu voto sumir! <a href="http://www.votoseguro.org/">http://www.votoseguro.org/</a><br/>*Ap&iuml;&iquest;&half;ie o Manifesto:        <a href="http://www.votoseguro.com/alertaprofessores/">http://www.votoseguro.com/alertaprofessores/</a></p><p>                    == THE WAR IN IRAQ COSTS ==<br/><a href="http://nationalpriorities.org/index.php?option=com_wrapper&Itemid=182">http://nationalpriorities.org/index.php?option=com_wrapper&Itemid=182</a></p><p>&#x9;</p><p>&#x9;<br/>&#x9;&#x9;<br/>_______________________________________________________ Yahoo! doce lar.

I learned to play the piano on an old instrument that was tuned flat, but as long as it was in tune with itself, it sounded &quot;right&quot;. (On the other hand, that could account for why I prefer tuning my &quot;reference&quot; notes slightly flat compared with A=440: two that I&apos;ve used are C=256 and D=290.) What sounds out of tune is when two notes &quot;clash&quot; in a musical context that they shouldn&apos;t be clashing. Even strong dissonances don&apos;t sound &quot;out of tune&quot; if the context and the quality of the performance makes it clear that these are exactly the right notes at the right time. But out of context, any interval with a certain amount of beating will sound &quot;out of tune&quot;, while intervals with less beating might sound pleasantly detuned (I happen to prefer slightly sharpened octaves for the extra color and warmth they bring to dull electronic timbres).</p></div>
