This is what it makes it impossible to write<br/>&gt; the chords as normal aug 6, dim 7, minor or dominant 7th chords.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; From my pocket score, we start in the tonality of Cb major. Then here<br/>&gt; are the chords:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Bn An An Eb Gb<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; B# D# An Eb Gb<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; C# () An Db Gb<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Dn Cn An Cn Gb<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Eb F# An Bn Gb<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; C# () An Db Gb<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Cn Dn An Dn Gb<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Cb () An Eb Gb -&gt; Cb Ger 6<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; and from then on we are in a standard aug 6 progression in E flat<br/>&gt; major. Clearly this cannot be interpreted literally within meantone.</p><p>It&apos;s hard to believe this is really supposed to be played as scored,<br/>however. You are in the key of Cb; hence, the first chord of<br/>B A A Eb Gb is already hard to believe; it would seem it ought to be<br/>Cb A A Eb Gb, solidly planted in the tonic. These are 18th century<br/>string players; they aren&apos;t actually going to play the Cb root a<br/>diesis higher as a B, fighting off the rest of the chord and the key<br/>as well. They are not the Kronos Quartet plus a violist. If you assume<br/>we start out with a Cb, not a B, which almost seems required, then<br/>passing from there to B# makes even less sense. The second chord not<br/>only has the indigestible B#, it has a D# fighting with an Eb. Again,<br/>the Kronos would not be playing this, so it is hard to see that this<br/>could really be anything other than C-Eb-A-Eb-Gb. It looks like<br/>replacing all the anomalous sharps with flats in the rest of it sorts<br/>it all out nicely: we don&apos;t want a C# and a Db in the same chord, nor<br/>an F# with a Gb.</p><p>Why is this a problem?</p><p>&gt; If we then try to rejig enharmonics to respect the E flat minor<br/>&gt; tonality with aug 4th degree we get<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Cb An An Eb Gb -&gt; Cb Ger 6<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Cn Eb An Eb Gb -&gt; An dim 7<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Db () An Db Gb -&gt; * Gb &apos;wolf minor&apos; chord with An not Bbb</p><p>This is not a &quot;wolf&quot; anything chord. This is a perfectly nice and<br/>acceptable chord as it is written, since the augmented second in<br/>meantone from Gb to A is not a &quot;discordance&quot; or whatever we are<br/>calling it today in meantone, but a nice, pleasing interval which<br/>makes a nice sounding chord.</p><p>&gt; Dn Cn An Cn Gb -&gt; * D &apos;wolf dominant 7&apos; chord with Gb not F#</p><p>Again, this is NOT a wolf! A wolf is the fifth you get with a<br/>diminished sixth in place of a perfect fifth. This chord is<br/>one I&apos;m quite familiar with and have often used; it is the meantone<br/>approximation to a 1-9/7-3/2-9/5 chord, which in meantone translates<br/>to D-Gb-A-C. It works even better with a flatter fifth that 1/6 comma,<br/>but these are string players and if they have the ears to hear it,<br/>they can find this chord. It has a distinctive sound and it would be<br/>interesting to know other examples in the 18th century literature<br/>where it appears to be used.</p><p>&gt; Eb Gb An Cb Gb -&gt; Cb Ger 6<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Dn Cn An Cn Gb -&gt; * D &apos;wolf dominant 7&apos;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Db () An Db Gb -&gt; * Gb &apos;wolf minor&apos;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Cn Dn An Dn Gb -&gt; * D &apos;wolf dominant 7&apos;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Cb () An Eb Gb -&gt; Cb Ger 7<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; So, it seems that in this passage, unless the viola and violin<br/>&gt; actually change pitch back and forth during their sustained notes,<br/>&gt; Mozart does use the wolf enharmonically &apos;wrong&apos; intervals for<br/>&gt; expressive effect.</p><p>I think you could use this passage as evidence that Mozart sometimes<br/>uses septimal chords aside from the German sixth. Once you get rid of<br/>the clearly anomalous sharps and replace them with the flats<br/>appropriate to the key of Cb, there is no problem with the tuning and<br/>no problem with the harmony, unless being interesting and intelligent<br/>is a problem. This is a very illuminating example; thanks for this,<br/>Tom. It suggests to me that the septimal resources of meantone, which<br/>Mozart was writing in when he wrote string music, were being explored<br/>pretty fully in the 18th century. Again, by not using meantone as a<br/>tuning basis I think we&apos;ve destroyed the music and any hope of<br/>understanding what it actually is doing.</p></div><h3><a id=58276 href="#58276">ðŸ”—</a>monz &#x3C;monz@tonalsoft.com&#x3E;</h3><span>4/26/2005 12:44:46 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>hi Gene and Tom,</p><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;Gene Ward Smith&quot; &lt;gwsmith@s...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; --- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;Tom Dent&quot; &lt;tdent@a...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; The progression in question is in the 3rd movement, bars 63-65.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &lt;snip&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; It&apos;s hard to believe this is really supposed to be played<br/>&gt; as scored, however.</p><p>i appreciate the effort that both of you have put into<br/>analyzing this. however, knowing that Mozart himself taught<br/>his students that musical intervals should be tuned<br/>according to 55-edo / 1/6-comma meantone, i think it&apos;s<br/>important to recognize and preserve his own notation of<br/>pitches in his compositions.</p><p>if he taught his students that there is a comma difference<br/>between D# and Eb, and he put them both into a chord<br/>played by unfretted strings, then i can only assume that<br/>he *wanted* that comma to be part of the chord.</p><p>in fact, i can see that Mozart was probably guided by<br/>melodic movement in this passage:</p><p>the 2nd violin has: Eb - Db - C - B - C - Db - D - Eb</p><p>the cello has, in between the F# - A:<br/>B - B# - C# - D - Eb - D - C# - C - Cb</p><p>i made a version of it in 55-edo in my Musica software,<br/>using exactly the pitches notated by Mozart, and it sounds<br/>fine -- in fact, quite like what a real string quintet<br/>might play.</p><p>(unfortunately, i can&apos;t share it yet with anyone except<br/>our small handful of Alpha testers. hopefully soon we&apos;ll<br/>be able to export Musica .piece files as MIDI files, then<br/>i can post them here.)</p><p>-monz</p></div><h3><a id=58279 href="#58279">ðŸ”—</a>Gene Ward Smith &#x3C;gwsmith@svpal.org&#x3E;</h3><span>4/26/2005 1:15:45 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;monz&quot; &lt;monz@t...&gt; wrote:</p><p>&gt; i appreciate the effort that both of you have put into<br/>&gt; analyzing this. however, knowing that Mozart himself taught<br/>&gt; his students that musical intervals should be tuned<br/>&gt; according to 55-edo / 1/6-comma meantone, i think it&apos;s<br/>&gt; important to recognize and preserve his own notation of<br/>&gt; pitches in his compositions.</p><p>In 55 meantone, the diesis is just a comma, and hence you have chords<br/>with a comma&apos;s worth of difference in them.
