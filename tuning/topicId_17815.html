Somehow my co-director Bill Rhoads<br/>talked Ornette Coleman into an interview prior to our Composers<br/>Concordance concert Friday, January 26th at Miller Theatre of<br/>Columbia.  These discussions from the stage should start at 7PM.<br/>Coleman  NEVER does interviews of this nature, so this was a great<br/>coup that he was able to negotiate with him over dinner....  Again,<br/>the Miller Theatre is at 2960 Broadway at 116 Street and the tickets<br/>are $17, available at the Miller Box Office, 212-854-7799.</p><p>________ _____ ____ _<br/>Joseph Pehrson</p></div>
