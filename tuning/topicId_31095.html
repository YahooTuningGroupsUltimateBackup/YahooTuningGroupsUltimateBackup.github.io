I had a look through the New Grove entry on<br/>Arabic music.  Some interesting details, like rast was first called rast<br/>in the 13th century.  They give it in quartertone notation, but insist<br/>that Safi ud-Din al-Urmawi was getting quartertones from his Pythagorean<br/>chain anyway.</p><p>Arabic scales in staff notation used to be standardised on a first note of<br/>G, but then changed to C which is pitched around D.  That may be something<br/>to think about as regards the Blackjack standardisation.  Including<br/>C-E[-G-B[-D-F]-A should work fine.</p><p>I found this in Manuel&apos;s bibliograhy:</p><p>Touma, Habib Hassan. &quot;Basics of Ratio in Arab Music. The schismatic<br/>Permutation of Safiyyuddin al-Urmawi&quot;, Lux Oriente. Festschrift Robert<br/>G&#xFFFD;nther zum 65. Geburtstag, Gustav Bosse-Verlag, Kassel, 1995.</p><p>Looks spot on, and more recent than the original German of Die Musik der<br/>Araber.  The first hint I&apos;ve seen that the schism[at]ic connection for<br/>al-Urmawi is more than an artifact of my fevered imagination.  I&apos;ll see if<br/>the library can find it.</p><p>I&apos;d also like to buy the translations of al-Farabi and al-Urmawi.  I found<br/>them at <a href="http://www.orient-lib.com">www.orient-lib.com</a> as two volumes, but it&apos;s a horrible site.<br/>After an hour of working it out, I have the immortal &quot;Server Error&quot;.  So<br/>if anybody can recommend an online French bookshop, please do.</p><p>John Chalmers gives the schismic tetrachord as coming from the Anonymous<br/>treatise translated by d&apos;Erlanger.  So is that worth getting as well?</p><p>                          Graham</p></div>
