There would be a selector button to choose either the major,<br/>&gt; minor, or blue reference. Also there would be a harmonic duodene array above the<br/>&gt; normal keyboard. This duodene would be used to change keys. Although I hazard<br/>&gt; that real keychanges are far less common in music than we think [I feel most<br/>&gt; keychanges can be accomplished without retuning the whole matrix. This way there<br/>&gt; is drive for reslolution on the initial 1/1].<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; The melody in this system would be the unchanging factor. Chords would<br/>&gt; adaptively tune around the melody note [similar to babershop where the lead does<br/>&gt; the least adptive tuning].</p><p>Interesting. and will enjoy hearing the results. It seems to me that these extended references<br/>might be what lead to the impulses of modulating in the first place. if so, one would tend to<br/>think that the adaptation route would water down the dynamics of the melody. It seems one could<br/>let the harmony be based on the same extended reference. Not saying you are right or wrong but<br/>just wanting to know how you ended up drawn to using it his way.
