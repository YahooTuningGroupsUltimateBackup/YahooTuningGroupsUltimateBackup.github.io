Notwithstanding this abuse<br/>&gt; at the hands of theoreticians who never composed music or heard music<br/>&gt; in 15, the 15 tone equal system remains one of the most musically<br/>&gt; popular tunings among all the ETs.</p><p>I like it.  I wrote an 85 minute ballet in it.  (One piece of that is stilll<br/>posted up at the Tuning Punks site.)</p><p>I also like the Carlos alpha tuning (non-octave, but near 15-tET) and have<br/>written in that as well.</p><p>&#x9;Rick</p></div>
