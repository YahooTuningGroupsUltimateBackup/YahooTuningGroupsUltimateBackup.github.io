This kind of<br/>historical information is very difficult to find and quite relevant to our<br/>field of interest, particularly given recent discussions about Bach. Also it<br/>gives performers of early music (hi Judith Conrad) good historical reasons<br/>to &quot;hop on the bandwagon&quot; and help promote the introduction of microtonal<br/>tunings such as 31-tone equal temperament into the musical marketplace.</p></div>
