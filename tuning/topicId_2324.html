That turns out to<br/>be related monotonically to straight RMS, so results in the same solutions for optimization problems as RMS.<br/>All this is mentioned in my paper, where I also gave the size of the fifth of the optimal meantone in terms<br/>of 26ths of an octave but failed to realize that it was 7/26-comma meantone.</p><p>&gt; These last two seem more likely in<br/>&gt; Sethares and your (HE) cases respectively.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; These all give higher weighting to the largest error than RMS does</p><p>These last two don&apos;t necessarily do so.</p></div><h3><a id=2418 href="#2418">ðŸ”—</a>Brett Barbaro &#x3C;barbaro@xxxxxxxxx.xxxx&#x3E;</h3><span>4/19/1999 1:01:28 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>&gt; &gt; These last two seem more likely in<br/>&gt; &gt; Sethares and your (HE) cases respectively.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; These all give higher weighting to the largest error than RMS does<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; These last two don&apos;t necessarily do so.</p><p>Whoops, your &quot;inverse Gaussian&quot; does do so, but is way too flat to approximate the dissonance curves.</p></div>
