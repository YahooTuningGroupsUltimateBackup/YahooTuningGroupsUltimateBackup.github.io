My<br/>&gt; Altec speakers must suck, since I really hear the last chord as a major 9th<br/>&gt; chord with the soprano singing the major 7th. I do hear the tiny upward<br/>&gt; shift today. Would you mind giving the notes for the last few chords?</p><p>Your Altecs are working fine. Evidently my Yamahas are not. I checked the<br/>score and the final melody note is G over an Ab major chord with added<br/>ninth. The spelling (up from bass) is Ab-Eb-Bb-C-G. Evidently, my speakers<br/>had some difficulty sounding the lowest pitch, leaving my ears only the<br/>upper four pitches. My assumption, knowing that the melody is largely in Eb<br/>major, was that the last chord would have been an Eb chord, and that&apos;s what<br/>I heard.</p><p>The important thing here is that both our ears are working fine. It&apos;s<br/>technology that was insufficient to the task. :-)</p><p>The significance of the moving pitch is still of interest, however, since<br/>the tuning of the G may very well have been influenced by the combination of<br/>the sounding Eb and Bb. To me, the shift is not tiny, however.</p><p>Jerry</p></div>
