If<br/>&gt;&gt;it appeared as a 5th and anything else, it would remove strict propriety.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;That&apos;s all fine, but still has nothing to do with modes. All 25 intervals in<br/>&gt;your table appear in all modes. Intervals are not always contructed up from<br/>&gt;the tonic!!!</p><p>As you point out, there is no point in considering &quot;all the modes&quot; if<br/>you&apos;re not measuring up from their tonics!  I&apos;ve always called the columns<br/>in the above chart modes, and I can&apos;t see myself stopping anytime soon.  I<br/>have even taken the trouble never to call a subset of a scale a mode, as is<br/>often done.</p><p>&gt;&gt;&quot;A list of integers representing the cardinalities of nested MOS&apos;s is a<br/>&gt;&gt;Constant Structure of all scales that can support the entire nest.  The<br/>&gt;&gt;larger the numbers, and the more of them, the fewer the number of scales in<br/>&gt;&gt;the Constant Structure (tho the number of scales is always infinite if you<br/>&gt;&gt;assume infinite tuning precision).&quot;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;Whoa, that&apos;s far out! Clearly not related to what we&apos;re arguing strict<br/>&gt;propriety may or may not be implied by, right?</p><p>Right.  This was my stab at Lumma-CS, which we now know is not CS.  It is a<br/>concept I got from Erv, tho; I wonder if he has a name for it?</p><p>&gt;The word from our favorite goat herder (hearder!) is that a Constant<br/>&gt;Structure is one where each interval occurs always subtended by the same<br/>&gt;number of steps. THAT IS ALL NO OTHER RESTRICTIONS this allows such scales<br/>&gt;as the enharmonic which rothenberg does not!</p><p>Bingo!  John Chalmers had also confirmed this in a message sent to me off<br/>the list last night.  Here&apos;s the scale...</p><p>1/1 28/27 16/15 4/3 3/2 14/9 8/5</p><p>...probably Paul&apos;s example works too, when tuned in JI: CS does not require<br/>any kind of propriety, even with the restriction that an interval appears<br/>in more than one mode!</p><p>When I first made my statement to the contrary, I was reading from a chart<br/>I posted here a while back...</p><p>&gt;Every a has only one s.<br/>&gt;(g) strict propriety</p><p>...&quot;a&quot; stands for &quot;acoustic interval&quot;, &quot;s&quot; for &quot;scalar interval&quot;, and &quot;g&quot;<br/>for &quot;guaranteed by&quot;.  The chart also had &quot;r&quot;, for &quot;requires&quot;, which does<br/>not appear above.  Just now I went to take strict propriety out of this<br/>section of my chart, and found that it was correct all along- strict<br/>propriety does guarantee CS!</p><p>-C.</p></div><h3><a id=5256 href="#5256">ðŸ”—</a>Paul H.
