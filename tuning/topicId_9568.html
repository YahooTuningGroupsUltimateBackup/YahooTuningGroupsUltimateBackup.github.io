In reality, the subject is filled with view points that are more close<br/>minded and biased that one could easily be the victim of assumptions that will tie one down<br/>FOR YEARS as opposed to opening the subject up. You have to HEAR FOR YOURSELVES. Many times I<br/>have listened to a theory that might REALLY convince me via its argument. When I come to my<br/>senses (I am easily influenced) and test or observe with my ear it doesn&apos;t hold up. We are<br/>surrounded by Fascist that make the likes of Boulez, or even a Breton:) seem mild.
