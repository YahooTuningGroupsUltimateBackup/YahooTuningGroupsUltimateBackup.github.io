I hurt many friendships in my childhood<br/>with similar behavior, and apparently I haven&apos;t grown up yet. I&apos;m so sorry<br/>for what I&apos;ve done. Dave has been the most impressive contributor to this<br/>list for some time now, consistenly surprising us with valuable ideas,<br/>indulging in in-depth studies with no material reward, and most recently<br/>presenting a totally unprecendented analysis of kleismatic temperament.

What do y&apos;all think?</p><p>No. We don&apos;t need a separatist movement on this list,<br/>it&apos;s been tried before.</p><p>What we do need is less of the cocky attitude from the<br/>folks who dominate this forum. Pat replys to a correction from<br/>Dan Wolf about a chord and notes that it&apos;s nice chord.<br/>Paul Erlich cops the Miles Davis attitude: &quot;So What?&quot;</p><p>I gave up trying to find the reference in my TD archives,<br/>but I seem to remember that sometime this year,<br/>a list newbe who posted a scale of ratios and a list member<br/>responded with a response of how it had errors. I can&apos;t find it,<br/>but is that any way to treat a new comer to the list?<br/>It may be the invented terminology of the list, but how&apos;s<br/>the newbe supposed to know?</p><p>I&apos;d also like to find the ref where Joe Mozo wrote off<br/>Genesis of a Music as beginners material - if I didn&apos;t<br/>dream it, I&apos;d love to quote it.</p><p>When I first got on this list years ago, my first post<br/>was met with a negative comment. It concerned<br/>tuning a EMu Proteus module &quot; Doesn&apos;t that belong in a<br/>hardware group?&quot;.  Like my question didn&apos;t belong here???</p><p>So the list is typical of the net. It used to have the<br/>feel of an academic forum, where posts were met with<br/>a bit of respect (with a few exceptions)<br/>- but that all changed when we went to onelist.</p><p>--<br/>* D a v i d         B e a r d s l e y<br/>*           <a href="mailto:xouoxno@virtulink.com">xouoxno@virtulink.com</a><br/>*<br/>* J u x t a p o s i t i o n  N e t  R a d i o<br/>* M E L A  v i r t u a l  d r e a m house monitor<br/>*<br/>* <a href="http://www.virtulink.com/immp/lookhere.htm">http://www.virtulink.com/immp/lookhere.htm</a></p></div><h3>Kraig Grady &#x3C;kraiggrady@xxxxxxxxx.xxxx&#x3E;</h3><span>8/2/1999 8:15:11 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Paul, Dave, And Pat!<br/>    Many of us have had our demons get the best of us.

So only if it wouldn&apos;t dampen enthusiam, I think moving the<br/>mathematical discussion off the list has merit.  For me, the mathematics on<br/>tuning@onelist can get overwhelming especially with all the cryptic bantering<br/>and misc. emails re corrections.</p><p>To give you my perspective, Juilliard did not offer one mathematics course<br/>while I was going there.  So I&apos;m working with a 12th grade math education.<br/>Perhaps a distillation of a separate discussion (as it relates to historic<br/>tunings and practical music composition problems) would bridge the two<br/>discussions.</p><p>I can go either way.  It might be a fun experiment to get less email about more<br/>practical matters.  However, I say this and I may not be around my computer for<br/>a few weeks to take a trip back east to make arrangements for my daughters<br/>wedding.<br/>RT</p><p>&quot;Paul H.

I agree completely with Dan Stearns that it is<br/>the responsiblity of those who want to see non-theoretical issues<br/>discussed in *this* forum to send in the contributions themselves!</p><p>I argued here before that one of the beautiful things about<br/>freedom of the press (including internet Lists) is that everything<br/>pertaining to a topic can be available to those who are interested,<br/>while stuff that one finds to be of no interest can be easily<br/>skipped over.  Is it really that difficult or painful for those<br/>of you who don&apos;t want to read complicated theory to simply move<br/>your scroll-bar down past the stuff you aren&apos;t interested in?<br/>Come on now, really.</p><p>I already miss Neil Haverstick&apos;s postings, which addressed aspects<br/>of microtonality that us theory-heads often overlook, and now<br/>I&apos;m really going to miss Dave Keenan&apos;s thought-provoking, albeit<br/>mathematically complex, insights.
