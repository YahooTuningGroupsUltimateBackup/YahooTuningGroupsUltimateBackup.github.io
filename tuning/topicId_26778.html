Although it has gotten<br/>mixed reviews from specialists, I recommend it. One of its strengths is<br/>the discussion of aulos tunings and Mathiessen&apos;s experiences with<br/>replicas. I might add that the surviving auloi he studied do not have<br/>equidistant fingerholes. He found that changing reeds from beating-reed<br/>to double-reed would change the pitch by at least a third and expand or<br/>contract all the intervals by up to 50%. Similarly, he could easily bend<br/>the pitch each note by 25 to 50 cents without much effort. In fact,<br/>staying on pitch was quite difficult. In agreement with Jim French&apos;s<br/>findings, the character of the reed was also very important.<br/>Clearly the aulos was a flexible, virtuoso instrument.</p><p>BTW, I also saw a glowing review of Johnny Reinhard&apos;s microtonal<br/>performance in Kazan in 1999 (?) in 20th Century Music.</p><p>--John</p></div>
