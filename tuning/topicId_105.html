The basic concept was that of<br/>the weight &amp; tension of individual intervals, determined by<br/>an acoustic and psychological classification and revealed through<br/>a system of harmonic and melodic necessity (derived in part from<br/>the overtone series). Hindemith&apos;s music after the late 1920&apos;s was<br/>increasingly based on such ideas.&quot;</p><p>___________________________________________________________________________<br/>____</p><p>For anyone interested in the black art of sequencing electric guitar parts<br/>(&amp; Hendrix), there is an amazing sequence (for Yamaha XG compatible<br/>synths only) of Voodoo Chile at<br/>&lt;<a href="http://www.geocities.com/Broadway/Alley/7514/Vchile.mid">http://www.geocities.com/Broadway/Alley/7514/Vchile.mid</a>&gt;</p><p>There are free XG software synths for Macs &amp; Windows :<br/>Quoting Manuel form a few digests back:</p><p>&gt;You can even have real-time synthesis by the CPU.

I can&apos;t find the piece mentioned in his list of works,<br/>though he did have an interest in American popular music in the period<br/>1921-22. Was it originally for piano?</p><p>&gt;Anyway, what I&apos;m wondering is, does anyone know what<br/>&gt;Well-Temperament Hindemith may have used/meant ?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt;From Prentice Hall&apos;s History of Music series,<br/>&gt;&quot;Twentieth Century Music : An Introduction&quot; by Eric Salzman<br/>&gt;I got the foll. about Hindemith that hints at his having<br/>&gt;more than a casual interest in microtonality :-</p><p>What Salzman is refering to is Hindemith&apos;s derivation of the 12 pitches of<br/>the chromatic scale from the overtones and undertones of a single tonic as<br/>set forth in his The Craft of Musical Composition. However, he goes on to<br/>say that equal temperament is a necessity and gives some justifications for<br/>stopping at 12. (I&apos;m afraid this is from memory, as it&apos;s been a long time<br/>since I&apos;ve read it.)</p><p>In fact, I think Hindemith felt the necessity to defend the use of 12 tones<br/>in an attempt to refute microtonalists (Carillo, Haba), while at the same<br/>time relating the derived pitches to a single tonic in an attempt to refute<br/>the possibility or desirability of atonality (Schoenberg, et al.). I seem<br/>to remember that the necessity for temperament is mentioned almost in<br/>passing.</p><p>The weights and tensions of intervals that Salzman mentions refers to<br/>Hindemith&apos;s &quot;series&quot; that served as a harmonic basis for his tonal system.<br/>The first of his series in a sense replaces the circle of fifths of<br/>common-practice harmony while the second in a sense replaces the stacking<br/>of thirds of common-practice harmonies with series of intervals of lesser<br/>to greater tension. Each of these series, I think, assumes equal<br/>temperament.</p><p>Hindemith was a pedant and saw the need (in his Germanic tradition) for<br/>deriving everything in his system in a clear, logical manner. It was<br/>important to him that his system be &quot;natural&quot; in the sense that it was<br/>derived from acoustical properties (he thought) as opposed to the<br/>&quot;arbitrariness&quot; he saw in the 12-tone method as well as further divisions<br/>of the octave by the microtonalists. He was certainly not unaware of what<br/>temperament was or its historical place (he was a great scholar of early<br/>music of course), but as far as I know he never wanted to use anything but<br/>12TET in his own compositions.</p><p>Bill</p><p>^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^<br/>^ Bill Alves                                      email: <a href="mailto:alves@hmc.edu">alves@hmc.edu</a> ^<br/>^ Harvey Mudd College                 URL: <a href="http://www2.hmc.edu/~alves/">http://www2.hmc.edu/~alves/</a> ^<br/>^ 301 E.

In one of Haba&apos;s books, it is<br/>mentioned that Hindemith played viola in one of his quartets and was very<br/>concerned to get the quarter-tone intonation correct to Haba&apos;s<br/>satisfaction.</p><p>Partch&apos;s _Genesis of a Music_ has a fairly clear critique of Hindemith as<br/>theorist.</p><p>For all the acoustical faults, Hindemith&apos;s theories concerning the relative<br/>consonance and directional pull of intervals have remained quite<br/>influential in compositional practice, particularly among commercial<br/>musicians. Such a line of theorizing is closer to the work of many<br/>contemporary tuning theorists than that of Haba, whose own theory had the<br/>&apos;deficit&apos; (as G.F. Haas puts it) of rigorously cataloging all possible<br/>harmonic combinations without putting forward neither a qualitative<br/>analysis of the harmonies nor a suggestion of the syntactic utility of the<br/>material.</p><p>Daniel Wolf<br/>Frankfurt (Paul Hindemith slept here, too)</p></div>
