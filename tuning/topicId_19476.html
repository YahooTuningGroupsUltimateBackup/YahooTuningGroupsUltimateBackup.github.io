A lot of commercial stuff is of the synth-wash /jungle sound variety and<br/>doesn&apos;t really take you anywhere. I was particularly taken with Indian music when I started<br/>practising yoga and meditation and the sound of a tanpura with simple slowly evolving melody is<br/>immensely relaxing. I spent a lot of time working with various drones and my exposure to Eastern<br/>music led me to Western sacred music. I have played Renaissance choral music in my classes to<br/>great effect.  My compositional activities were initially based mainly on dronal, modal modulation<br/>and contrapuntal choral musics. Arvo Part led me to look at purity in tuning and from there to<br/>Just Intonation. Although some might disagree, I find great purity in justly intoned music and it<br/>is this element that has ramifications for music therapy and meditation music. I&apos;m sure you know<br/>the effect of communal overtone singing and chanting. As a performing musician I play guitar and<br/>lute and sing in choirs. And I teach yoga and meditation.</p><p>The upheaval of learning a new universe of scales, harmony and theory set me back a bit in<br/>composition. I had a guitar refretted to 22-tet to keep me going and have some compositions ready<br/>for performance soon. But like you it seems, I can&apos;t get away from tying together music and<br/>meditation.  The art is in placement, repetition without boredom and subtlety in timbral shift.<br/>You&apos;re right about gongs and bells. I use Zen bells a lot (they are actually traditional in some<br/>meditation schools) in composition and in meditation classes. I&apos;ve just converted a double garage<br/>into a workshop in the Scottish Borders where I&apos;ve started making simple instruments and learning<br/>the skills to make more elaborate ones. Very liberating. Several of the compositions I have in<br/>mind will be introspective and meditative in nature. Having written and performed meditative<br/>pieces to shaggy cramped audiences in performance venues I developed a feel for the power of<br/>various forms and timbres to relax and uplift.</p><p>On the electronic front, as I said, I use an Doepfer analogue system, very powerful and capable of<br/>beautiful timbres. With an analogue sequencer endlessly varying gamelan like sequences can be<br/>generated. I&apos;ll try to get some stuff up on a website soon.<br/>But I have to resist the urge to churn out bleepy ambient techno. One avenue I will be pursuing<br/>shortly is the tuning of the Doepfer to some of the amazing Hexanies, Eikosanies and other<br/>systems. Maybe an oscilloscope would help. And then with some Zen bells, dronal strings and justly<br/>intoned choir......</p><p>I suppose it would be interesting to gather feedback on the effects of various scales, ratios,<br/>harmonies, timbres and their variations on groups of meditators. Thanks for the opportunity to<br/>share ideas about these topics. As you say there&apos;s a long way to go in the field but as they say<br/>the journey of a thousand miles begins with just one step (or is that one just step?)</p></div><h3>Dave Keenan &#x3C;D.KEENAN@UQ.NET.AU&#x3E;</h3><span>2/27/2001 1:21:48 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In tuning@y..., Alison Monteith &lt;alison.monteith3@w...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt; ... but as they say<br/>&gt; the journey of a thousand miles begins with just one step (or is<br/>that one just step?)</p><p>I love it!</p></div><h3>Alison Monteith &#x3C;alison.monteith3@which.net&#x3E;</h3><span>2/28/2001 4:04:10 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Haresh BAKSHI wrote:</p><p>&gt; Hi Lawrence,  while Indian classical music may be entertaining, it is<br/>&gt; ONLY about meditation and samadhi.</p><p>Dear  Haresh</p><p>Totally true and often ignored in discussions of Indian music.

You might remember a<br/>thread last autumn about drones that frizzled out a bit prematurely.  As the Scottish Borders is<br/>cut off from the rest of the world by snow I can take more time to share some of my thoughts and<br/>experiences. A lot of my earlier ( what&apos;s the opposite of antediluvian?) 12 tet composition used<br/>modal modulation and hence various dronal and pedal point techniques to pin down the modes. The<br/>shift to just intonation and other equal temperaments was at first a matter of expanding melodic<br/>and harmonic resources and so came quite naturally. So the interest in drones is still there. I<br/>suppose you can split drones into acoustic or electronic with possibly a third category of<br/>electronically modified acoustic drones. It wouldn&apos;t be too far off the mark to say that in<br/>electronic synthesis and in future instrument design we are looking at the concept of the tuning<br/>of drones.</p><p>My earliest experience of acoustic drones was of course the bagpipes which we all learn in<br/>kindergarten here ; - ) What struck me about this instrument was its total self sufficiency (so<br/>much so that a lot of people are quite happy to leave it well alone.). Secondly the drone isn&apos;t<br/>uniform in timbre. There is a constant dynamism in the sound which I later discovered to be the<br/>rise and fall of partials caused by the complexity of the movement of wind in the chanter bore. I<br/>think it is the quality of this movement that makes a good drone. For example I would be reluctant<br/>to use any of the four simple waves (sine, square, saw or triangle) as a drone for long without<br/>running the risk of losing vitality in a composition. BTW one of the best wind produced drones<br/>available is a sample of your vacuum cleaner in full voice. Zappa would have approved. The vacuum<br/>is simply an electrically driven airbag with a simple cylindrical bore. Sampling is an art so you<br/>have to find the optimum loop length which involves listening for cycles in the vacuum&apos;s sound.<br/>Then it can be processed with FX, eq, wave manipulation, layering or whatever your sampler allows.<br/>The other obvious wind choice is the didgeridoo. This sacred instrument is great as a drone to<br/>improvise over as a good player can produce strong controllable harmonics in counterpoint to<br/>another instrumental or vocal melody. Strangely I have found that very young babies love the didge<br/>and can happily relax and sleep to its sound.</p><p>String drones are an obvious choice and my formative experiences in these were from Celtic and<br/>Indian musics. I learned a lot from living in Ireland and accompanying traditional music. As well<br/>as the guitar I had a 5 course flat back bouzouki made by a great Dublin luthier called Joe Foley.<br/>They call the 5 course version a blarge which I think means bloody large. I got the tuning dadGD<br/>from Donal Lunny, the bouzouki main man. This instrument has an incredible zing to it, very strong<br/>in upper partials and if played rhythmically the open strings and good fifths of 12 tet can give<br/>fairly just chords. As the style of music is often purely modal or uses tonic, dominant,<br/>subdominant with the occasional minor substitution, there is no need for the tenseness of dominant<br/>sevenths or complex chords. The guitar in drop D can have the same effect. If you want to hear<br/>this style, listen to Matt Molloy&apos;s (flautist) &quot;The Heathery Breeze.&quot; This is a landmark album in<br/>Western acoustic music because of the combination of the accompanying bouzouki and guitar played<br/>by Donal Lunny and Arty McGlynn. There is also an accompaniment by the latter on an album by<br/>Uillean piper Paddy Keenan in which a complex polyrhythmic drone is set up and tones from the<br/>harmonic series touched on to give a truly mesmerising effect of two or three instruments. Or<br/>perhaps the very fact of hammering a guitar into a good valve microphone can increase the<br/>intensity of the lower partials. The style is very much an emulation of the drones of a bagpipe. I<br/>can supply a recommended discography by private email if you like this style.</p><p>Which all leads to the mighty tanpura. The beauty of this instrument lies in its simplicity.<br/>Strings and a resonator. The fact that there is no fretting or great tension in the strings and<br/>only unison, octave and fifth  in the most common tuning allows the full richness of the vibrating<br/>string to resonate. As it is normally plucked at the first harmonic node, I suppose that partial<br/>is dampened so you get a strong second harmonic (the twelfth of the fundamental), then, it seems<br/>to me, a good spread of prominent partials right up the lower part of the series ( just as you<br/>pointed out Jacky) with the added complexity of combination tones. Hence the lush wall of sound.<br/>I&apos;ve never bothered sampling the tanpura. Even if you isolated one cycle the residue of that cycle<br/>should linger on into the start of the next. Throw in the irregularity of the plucking hand and<br/>you&apos;d need several gigabytes of sampler to get a realistic sample. Be as well learning to play it.</p><p>A lot can be done in electronic music with complex waveforms. Modular analogue synths are the<br/>business for drones because once you have the timbre patched in you can play the partials in a<br/>very hands on fashion, a difficult task with digital synths even with controllers. And they are<br/>analogue, so, in my view, better waves. Two modules that I experiment with a lot are an audio<br/>divider which gives attenuators for the first to fourth sub octaves of a given input, in effect a<br/>subset of the sub harmonic series. All waves output are square. The output can then be seriously<br/>mashed with a voltage controlled waveform processor which has a clipping circuit and an<br/>assymettrical amplifier. The signals are then added. As well as being manually controllable, the<br/>resulting waveforms can be modulated by control voltages. It&apos;s the resulting complex and changing<br/>waveforms which are ideal for drones though lethal on the speaker system. The next step is to try<br/>to add an element of methodical control of the series number and intensity of the harmonics (your<br/>particular interest I believe, Jacky) which is what I suppose synthesis was originally all about<br/>in the beginning, ie emulating acoustic instruments. Just as I would challenge an electronic sound<br/>designer to come up with a realistic tanpura or pipe drone  so would I challenge an instrument<br/>maker to create some of the timbres that can be had out of a Doepfer or a Moog. Each category has<br/>its uniqueness. I found some of that uniqueness in David Beardsley&apos;s two pieces.</p><p>Lastly, the human voice. Composers like Arvo Part and John Tavener use choral drones to great<br/>effect. Both have ascribed mystical significance to the use of the drone, explaining that it<br/>represents the unchanging divine principle underpinning the changing world. Behind this concept<br/>lies the substantial authority and beautiful musical culture of the Eastern Orthodox Church.<br/>Interesting that the basso profundo is normally associated with this tradition. Then there is<br/>harmonic or overtone singing, again a self sufficent system with drone and melody possible at the<br/>same time. I tried sampling some of this from a radio excerpt. I think it was an East European<br/>folk ensemble with a solo male voice doing the overtoning. Again I found  it impossible to isolate<br/>a usable loop because the intensity and movement of the lower partials was so random. In fact the<br/>vocal line was no longer a timbre within an ensemble but a composition in its own right.</p><p>I hope all this rambling helps to answer your question. I have found the more scientific threads<br/>on spectral analysis to be most useful in my study and understanding of drones and look forward to<br/>more fruitful discussion.</p><p>Best Wishes</p></div><h3>Seth Austen &#x3C;klezmusic@earthlink.net&#x3E;</h3><span>3/3/2001 6:52:48 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>on 3/2/01 2:18 PM, <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a> at <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a> wrote:</p><p>&gt; Message: 8<br/>&gt; Date: Fri, 02 Mar 2001 11:53:17 +0000<br/>&gt; From: Alison Monteith &lt;<a href="mailto:alison.monteith3@which.net">alison.monteith3@which.net</a>&gt;<br/>&gt; Subject: Re: Re:</p><p>&gt; Secondly the drone isn&apos;t<br/>&gt; uniform in timbre.

It wouldn&apos;t be too far off<br/>the mark to say that in<br/>&gt; electronic synthesis and in future instrument design we are looking<br/>at the concept of the tuning<br/>&gt; of drones.</p><p>Alison,</p><p>Thanks so much for speaking about your use of drones!</p><p>My experience has been mostly with categories 2 &amp; 3. With #2, I will<br/>use sine waves which &quot;sweep&quot; through the harmonics, which are layered<br/>with harmonics 1-16, 1-8 and 1-4.  This creates movement in the drone<br/>which has always been a direct effort to create a sound which can<br/>serve a function that is similar to that of the tamboura.</p><p>With #3, I will combine a guitar note, with the harmonic sweeps, to<br/>create an acoustic/electronic hybrid drone.</p><p>&gt;<br/>&gt; My earliest experience of acoustic drones was of course the<br/>bagpipes which we all learn in<br/>&gt; kindergarten here ; - ) What struck me about this instrument was<br/>its total self sufficiency (so<br/>&gt; much so that a lot of people are quite happy to leave it well<br/>alone.). Secondly the drone isn&apos;t<br/>&gt; uniform in timbre. There is a constant dynamism in the sound which<br/>I later discovered to be the<br/>&gt; rise and fall of partials caused by the complexity of the movement<br/>of wind in the chanter bore. I<br/>&gt; think it is the quality of this movement that makes a good drone.</p><p>This is fascinating, and I couldn&apos;t agree more about the issue of<br/>movement in the drone.</p><p>&gt; For example I would be reluctant<br/>&gt; to use any of the four simple waves (sine, square, saw or triangle)<br/>as a drone for long without<br/>&gt; running the risk of losing vitality in a composition.</p><p>Yes - I agree that a static drone without &quot;sweeping&quot; or &quot;movement&quot; of<br/>the harmonics is not effective.</p><p>&gt; BTW one of the best wind produced drones<br/>&gt; available is a sample of your vacuum cleaner in full voice. Zappa<br/>would have approved. The vacuum<br/>&gt; is simply an electrically driven airbag with a simple cylindrical<br/>bore. Sampling is an art so you<br/>&gt; have to find the optimum loop length which involves listening for<br/>cycles in the vacuum&apos;s sound.<br/>&gt; Then it can be processed with FX, eq, wave manipulation, layering<br/>or whatever your sampler allows.</p><p>This put a smile on my face!  I&apos;ve explored using my WW2 short-wave<br/>radio in this manner - an infinity of great tones is possible with<br/>this old beast, which I really treat like a synthesizer, where<br/>broadcast signals are the generating waveforms.</p><p>&gt; The other obvious wind choice is the didgeridoo. This sacred<br/>instrument is great as a drone to<br/>&gt; improvise over as a good player can produce strong controllable<br/>harmonics in counterpoint to<br/>&gt; another instrumental or vocal melody. Strangely I have found that<br/>very young babies love the didge<br/>&gt; and can happily relax and sleep to its sound.</p><p>I love the Didj and made two different models last year that sound<br/>wonderful, but as stated before, I&apos;m quite inadequate, when it comes<br/>to circular breathing. It is a gorgeous sound to be sure, and I used<br/>them on my last CD &quot;Galunlati&quot; in quite a few key places. Mostly<br/>there I didn&apos;t employ any vocalizations, but just the plain sound of<br/>the Didj alone, and by manipulating lip pressures I got some pleasant<br/>overtones. I have played them quite a bit to develop the technique of<br/>injecting a vocal note into the sound to create a really thick multi-<br/>phonic chord sound (Manglesdorff inspired Didj playing). One thing<br/>that&apos;s neat about the Didj (or about any winds), is that once you<br/>have got the air column in vibration, it takes less energy to keep it<br/>going - some things I did to my design help this too. These things<br/>have got some serious bass too! I wanted to make them have as low a<br/>tone as possible, so as to put the emphasis on the overtones. Some<br/>early failures at design, involved making them too long, and my lips<br/>were of insufficient mass to activate the vibration. The wax<br/>mouthpiece, I&apos;ve found to be vital to good tone, and when I custom<br/>tailored this to my own dimensions, the results were nice. So there<br/>was a bit of trial and error, leading to the ones I kept. It is one<br/>of my favorite drone instruments too!</p><p>&gt;<br/>&gt; String drones are an obvious choice and my formative experiences in<br/>these were from Celtic and<br/>&gt; Indian musics. I learned a lot from living in Ireland and<br/>accompanying traditional music. As well<br/>&gt; as the guitar I had a 5 course flat back bouzouki made by a great<br/>Dublin luthier called Joe Foley.<br/>&gt; They call the 5 course version a blarge which I think means bloody<br/>large. I got the tuning dadGD<br/>&gt; from Donal Lunny, the bouzouki main man. This instrument has an<br/>incredible zing to it, very strong<br/>&gt; in upper partials and if played rhythmically the open strings and<br/>good fifths of 12 tet can give<br/>&gt; fairly just chords. As the style of music is often purely modal or<br/>uses tonic, dominant,<br/>&gt; subdominant with the occasional minor substitution, there is no<br/>need for the tenseness of dominant<br/>&gt; sevenths or complex chords. The guitar in drop D can have the same<br/>effect.</p><p>This sounds very nice. Please let us know when CDs of your music<br/>become available. By all descriptions, I would love to hear anything<br/>you&apos;ve done.</p><p>&gt; If you want to hear<br/>&gt; this style, listen to Matt Molloy&apos;s (flautist) &quot;The Heathery<br/>Breeze.&quot; This is a landmark album in<br/>&gt; Western acoustic music because of the combination of the<br/>accompanying bouzouki and guitar played<br/>&gt; by Donal Lunny and Arty McGlynn. There is also an accompaniment by<br/>the latter on an album by<br/>&gt; Uillean piper Paddy Keenan in which a complex polyrhythmic drone is<br/>set up and tones from the<br/>&gt; harmonic series touched on to give a truly mesmerising effect of<br/>two or three instruments. Or<br/>&gt; perhaps the very fact of hammering a guitar into a good valve<br/>microphone can increase the<br/>&gt; intensity of the lower partials. The style is very much an<br/>emulation of the drones of a bagpipe. I<br/>&gt; can supply a recommended discography by private email if you like<br/>this style.</p><p>Please do send me a discography. I&apos;ll try to seek out some of it<br/>here. Thanks!</p><p>&gt; Which all leads to the mighty tanpura. The beauty of this<br/>instrument lies in its simplicity.<br/>&gt; Strings and a resonator. The fact that there is no fretting or<br/>great tension in the strings and<br/>&gt; only unison, octave and fifth  in the most common tuning allows the<br/>full richness of the vibrating<br/>&gt; string to resonate. As it is normally plucked at the first harmonic<br/>node, I suppose that partial<br/>&gt; is dampened so you get a strong second harmonic (the twelfth of the<br/>fundamental), then, it seems<br/>&gt; to me, a good spread of prominent partials right up the lower part<br/>of the series ( just as you<br/>&gt; pointed out Jacky) with the added complexity of combination tones.<br/>Hence the lush wall of sound.<br/>&gt; I&apos;ve never bothered sampling the tanpura. Even if you isolated one<br/>cycle the residue of that cycle<br/>&gt; should linger on into the start of the next. Throw in the<br/>irregularity of the plucking hand and<br/>&gt; you&apos;d need several gigabytes of sampler to get a realistic sample.<br/>Be as well learning to play it.</p><p>Yes, it is beautiful and inspiring sound. I would like to purchase<br/>one someday. They can be huge though! A funny story is that some<br/>friends I have locally bought one about 100 miles from where I live,<br/>and couldn&apos;t get the case in their car, so the next time I drove to<br/>this store (a dealer in &quot;world music&quot; instruments), I was able to<br/>bring it back in my car, but I had to lay the seat down to get<br/>this &quot;coffin&quot; sized box in there! Quite funny actually, but they were<br/>glad I brought it to them.</p><p>&gt; A lot can be done in electronic music with complex waveforms.<br/>Modular analogue synths are the<br/>&gt; business for drones because once you have the timbre patched in you<br/>can play the partials in a<br/>&gt; very hands on fashion, a difficult task with digital synths even<br/>with controllers. And they are<br/>&gt; analogue, so, in my view, better waves. Two modules that I<br/>experiment with a lot are an audio<br/>&gt; divider which gives attenuators for the first to fourth sub octaves<br/>of a given input, in effect a<br/>&gt; subset of the sub harmonic series. All waves output are square. The<br/>output can then be seriously<br/>&gt; mashed with a voltage controlled waveform processor which has a<br/>clipping circuit and an<br/>&gt; assymettrical amplifier. The signals are then added. As well as<br/>being manually controllable, the<br/>&gt; resulting waveforms can be modulated by control voltages. It&apos;s the<br/>resulting complex and changing<br/>&gt; waveforms which are ideal for drones though lethal on the speaker<br/>system. The next step is to try<br/>&gt; to add an element of methodical control of the series number and<br/>intensity of the harmonics (your<br/>&gt; particular interest I believe, Jacky) which is what I suppose<br/>synthesis was originally all about<br/>&gt; in the beginning, ie emulating acoustic instruments. Just as I<br/>would challenge an electronic sound<br/>&gt; designer to come up with a realistic tanpura or pipe drone  so<br/>would I challenge an instrument<br/>&gt; maker to create some of the timbres that can be had out of a<br/>Doepfer or a Moog. Each category has<br/>&gt; its uniqueness. I found some of that uniqueness in David<br/>Beardsley&apos;s two pieces.</p><p>It appears we have similar sounding methods of doing this with<br/>electronics. I have uploaded a 35 second long example of my drone<br/>sound design to my folder in the files section for everyone to check<br/>out. This one is in the key of E, which is the lowest functional note<br/>I can sing in. It has always interested me to know what my vocal 1/1<br/>is - which seems to be E.</p><p>Here I have layered the sweeps of harmonics 1-16, 1-8 and 1-4, so<br/>there is constant movement going on. Any comments are welcome and if<br/>anyone feels so compelled, you may use this sample in your music,<br/>provided you let me hear what you do with it.  I have a compliment of<br/>JI scales that I use over this kind of drone, which are derived from<br/>a series I have grown to call the &quot;Harmonic Mirror&quot;, of which there<br/>are 12 - a scale for each month of the year. Some of this I&apos;ve spoken<br/>about before here.</p><p>Yes, I have enjoyed David Beardsley&apos;s music too for all these<br/>attributes.</p><p>&gt; Lastly, the human voice. Composers like Arvo Part and John Tavener<br/>use choral drones to great<br/>&gt; effect. Both have ascribed mystical significance to the use of the<br/>drone, explaining that it<br/>&gt; represents the unchanging divine principle underpinning the<br/>changing world. Behind this concept<br/>&gt; lies the substantial authority and beautiful musical culture of the<br/>Eastern Orthodox Church.<br/>&gt; Interesting that the basso profundo is normally associated with<br/>this tradition. Then there is<br/>&gt; harmonic or overtone singing, again a self sufficent system with<br/>drone and melody possible at the<br/>&gt; same time. I tried sampling some of this from a radio excerpt. I<br/>think it was an East European<br/>&gt; folk ensemble with a solo male voice doing the overtoning. Again I<br/>found  it impossible to isolate<br/>&gt; a usable loop because the intensity and movement of the lower<br/>partials was so random. In fact the<br/>&gt; vocal line was no longer a timbre within an ensemble but a<br/>composition in its own right.</p><p>I love Arvo Part and John Tavener, and feel similarly about the use<br/>of drones. In my Creative Collective, we are all hugely into singing<br/>harmonies, and also work with overtone techniques quite a bit too.  I<br/>practice daily, and have gotten better at suppressing the fundamental<br/>in my voice, so as to make the harmonics more clear. There&apos;s<br/>something that one can do in the throat, which defies description<br/>that enables one to control the volume of the fundamental, not to<br/>mention strategic use of the tongue around the teeth.</p><p>&gt; I hope all this rambling helps to answer your question. I have<br/>found the more scientific threads<br/>&gt; on spectral analysis to be most useful in my study and<br/>understanding of drones and look forward to<br/>&gt; more fruitful discussion.</p><p>It has been wonderful, and I apologize for the time it has taken to<br/>reply - I&apos;ve had a real juggling act going on here this weekend.</p><p>It may perhaps be of interest to know that on my current CD project,<br/>we are using ensembles of idiophones (gongs, bells, ting sha and the<br/>like) as drones for choral singing. I&apos;m using a method that I&apos;m<br/>calling Spectral Tempering, where the spectra of all the idiophones<br/>are taken into consideration for the best ensemble tuning. The<br/>results of my initial tests and sequences have proven to be quite<br/>lovely in combination. This method requires one to, in a way,<br/>consider all the timbres being used in combination as a single<br/>timbre. When complete (which may take until summer), we will use many<br/>forms of harmony singing and overtone (throat singing) techniques,<br/>where we sing in the spectral scales of these inharmonic timbres. An<br/>interesting aside, is that I found that compressed octaves, rather<br/>than stretched were more common in the spectra of the idiophones -<br/>really quite a surprise to find, because I think I had some<br/>preconceptions that I would find the opposite. Certainly makes a case<br/>for having a open mind about what one may find in such an endeavor.</p><p>All this has grown out of an experience I had last year where during<br/>a sampling/recording session, I was able to clearly make my voice<br/>unison with the partials of several Gongs. This immediately made this<br/>whole concept spring into mind, but I&apos;ve had to wrap up the last CD,<br/>before I could get on with it.</p><p>Looking forward to further discussions.</p><p>Best Regards,</p><p>Jacky Ligon</p></div><h3>ligonj@northstate.net</h3><span>3/4/2001 8:33:31 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In tuning@y..., Seth Austen &lt;klezmusic@e...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt; &gt; From: Alison Monteith &lt;alison.monteith3@w...&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; Secondly the drone isn&apos;t<br/>&gt; &gt; uniform in timbre.

I have played Renaissance choral<br/>music in my classes to<br/>&gt;great effect.  My compositional activities were initially based mainly on<br/>dronal, modal modulation<br/>&gt;and contrapuntal choral musics. Arvo Part led me to look at purity in<br/>tuning and from there to<br/>&gt;Just Intonation.</p><p>A curious but logical step - Arvo Part has for me a remarkable ability to<br/>step back from his music, to allow it to follow simple rules, and to have<br/>immense restraint in his developments of sound. I came to JI more via Terry<br/>Riley through finding that timbre and scale melted into each other<br/>beautifully and warmly. I loved and still love playing in mixolydian mode<br/>with a pure (to 1 cent anyhow) 4/5/6/7 tonic tetrad. That to me is a great<br/>goal for tuning, to have the timbre and the scale become part of one entity<br/>or at least become indistinguishable .It makes the act of hearing more in<br/>the unconscious, and easy. In my 1985 piece Silverstream, I use 16 voices,<br/>each with a slightly different timbre, so that the long envelopes on notes<br/>make melody and timbre into a highly structured but amorphous sounding<br/>mobile sculpture.</p><p>&gt;Although some might disagree, I find great purity in justly intoned music and it<br/>&gt;is this element that has ramifications for music therapy and meditation<br/>music. I&apos;m sure you know<br/>&gt;the effect of communal overtone singing and chanting. As a performing<br/>musician I play guitar and<br/>&gt;lute and sing in choirs. And I teach yoga and meditation.</p><p>Greatly broad and deeply rooted! Good for you.</p><p>&gt;The upheaval of learning a new universe of scales, harmony and theory set<br/>me back a bit in<br/>&gt;composition. I had a guitar refretted to 22-tet to keep me going and have<br/>some compositions ready<br/>&gt;for performance soon. But like you it seems, I can&apos;t get away from tying<br/>together music and<br/>&gt;meditation.</p><p>Why &quot;but&quot;? Just curious.<br/>When and where is your music being performed? - I do hope its being<br/>recorded, I would love to hear it.</p><p>I came to JI/retuning slowly. I saw what only playing JI on piano did to<br/>Terry Riley&apos;s concert availability. I actually feel personally that to make<br/>JI into an exclusive crusade is not essential. Some will prefer to devote<br/>themselves to it, but despite interest value I sense that JI is no guarantee<br/>of great results, I hold a lot of store by being able to play tempered<br/>pianos, good music is from the ethers and is not that biased towards tuning<br/>fussiness. That said I am still vastly interested in tuning, and deeply<br/>respect those who aspire to compose with those approaches.</p><p>&gt;  The art is in placement, repetition without boredom and subtlety in<br/>timbral shift.<br/>&gt;You&apos;re right about gongs and bells. I use Zen bells a lot (they are<br/>actually traditional in some<br/>&gt;meditation schools) in composition and in meditation classes. I&apos;ve just<br/>converted a double garage<br/>&gt;into a workshop in the Scottish Borders where I&apos;ve started making simple<br/>instruments and learning<br/>&gt;the skills to make more elaborate ones.</p><p>Do tell us more about this.</p><p>&gt; Very liberating. Several of the compositions I have in<br/>&gt;mind will be introspective and meditative in nature. Having written and<br/>performed meditative<br/>&gt;pieces to shaggy cramped audiences in performance venues I developed a feel<br/>for the power of<br/>&gt;various forms and timbres to relax and uplift.</p><p>What kind of performance occasions are these?</p><p>&gt;On the electronic front, as I said, I use an Doepfer analogue system, very<br/>powerful and capable of<br/>&gt;beautiful timbres. With an analogue sequencer endlessly varying gamelan<br/>like sequences can be<br/>&gt;generated. I&apos;ll try to get some stuff up on a website soon.<br/>&gt;But I have to resist the urge to churn out bleepy ambient techno. One<br/>avenue I will be pursuing<br/>&gt;shortly is the tuning of the Doepfer to some of the amazing Hexanies,<br/>Eikosanies and other<br/>&gt;systems. Maybe an oscilloscope would help. And then with some Zen bells,<br/>dronal strings and justly<br/>&gt;intoned choir......</p><p>May you resist the urge with style and honour (or not at all - if that&apos;s<br/>part of your personality!).<br/>I wish you Good luck and fertile inspiration for this upcoming music.</p><p>&gt;I suppose it would be interesting to gather feedback on the effects of<br/>various scales, ratios,<br/>&gt;harmonies, timbres and their variations on groups of meditators.</p><p>In 1989 healer/counsellor Isobel McGilvray conducted 100 free therapy<br/>sessions to analyse the experiences of 15 folk listening to each of the 7<br/>sound mandalas that had been devised (then called ShapeTapes) which resulted<br/>in a small booklet describing this. In practice individuals vary enormously<br/>so it can take some pinning down.</p><p>&gt;Thanks for the opportunity to<br/>&gt;share ideas about these topics. As you say there&apos;s a long way to go in the<br/>field but as they say<br/>&gt;the journey of a thousand miles begins with just one step (or is that one<br/>just step?)</p><p>Probably both!

My friend Terry Riley studied for over 25<br/>years with the singer Pandit Pran Nath. When I hear Pran Nath&apos;s recordings<br/>or Terry&apos;s singing or Fateh Ali Khan or Bhimsen Joshi I certainly feel close<br/>to my roots in inspiration.</p><p>Sound Mandalas: the subject of a previous post, evolved through my deep<br/>concerns with the work of John Whitney sr. and LaMonte Young- I created an<br/>orchestral note - a digitally alive smooth journey through 400000 timbres<br/>and back to base. There are parallels with tamboura both acoustic and<br/>metaphorical. My friend Nickolay Kachanov (who leads the Russian Chamber<br/>Choir in New York) and who sings the most beautiful undertones and<br/>overtone-singing was awed by the mandalas as they conjure higher harmonics<br/>than are physically possible with the human voice. I am trying to develop<br/>the sounds further at the moment in MAX/MSP as I have intuited that I have<br/>only just scratched the surface when it comes to etching tone sequences on<br/>the timbral loom at one pitch, let alone more. I&apos;m trying at present to make<br/>clusters of harmonics, several harmonics wide, each cluster travelling up<br/>and down the harmonic axis at different speeds. This all attempting to make<br/>sounds which change using a new language derived from the natural laws of<br/>acoustics.</p><p>Some people can&apos;t believe I&apos;m (the sound mandala man) the same person who<br/>produces my piano improvisations, but I feel that both areas are highly<br/>linked. I have recorded over 1500 piano improvisations, and in the near<br/>future I hope to use JI or other re-tunings in this work, what I most am<br/>attracted to is to not know what I am going to play beforehand as much as<br/>possible. True one repeats oneself but this allows a deeper, less surface<br/>self to speak (dare I call it the soul here? perhaps not ..... people might<br/>get the idea that this is a read-about or received idea- .........which it<br/>is not...) and this depth self is to me a source of potent, exciting and<br/>immensely peaceful refreshment. It forms the backbone of my<br/>score-compositional, computer-generated-musical and other activities, and<br/>this aspiration to imbibe ideas spontaneously is a risky but, when it works,<br/>awesomely wonderful method of creating for me.</p><p>In my 1977 piece for tape &quot;Unstruck Sound&quot; I experimented with attempting to<br/>make a piece imitating the &quot;Sound Behind Sound&quot;. In the Vedas, I am informed<br/>by my friend and Vedic scholar Jeanine Miller, physical sound is described<br/>as being only 1/4 of the sounds which sound on all levels of the universe.<br/>Other levels are often unrecognised consciously. One can make hovering<br/>effects with long piano chords by removing the attack with fadeins, and this<br/>piece was made with streams of these sounds at different speeds. Danielou<br/>had inspired me with this idea from Indian music &apos;cosmology&apos; and to this day<br/>I feel that if music does not resonate at a higher level than merely<br/>physical then it is not communicating as it could. A second music should be<br/>heard over and above the physical. I find this transcendence in the music of<br/>certain composers (Alan Hovhaness, Lou Harrison, Jean Catoire, Arvo<br/>Part........see <a href="http://www.planettree.org">http://www.planettree.org</a> for more thoughts and my essay<br/>&quot;The Universe As An Infinite Piano&quot;) but certainly not in that of Harrison<br/>Birtwistle and many &quot;sustained aggression&quot; composers who stimulate more on,<br/>and identify solely with, the level of concrete mind, even though Birtwistle<br/>speaks about going for the stars.</p><p>I share your view that entertainment is of a different order than raga, of<br/>course! But humanity is waking up slowly. Contemporary music is absorbing<br/>the richness of more established cultures slowly but surely and by creating<br/>Planet Tree Music Festival in London I hope to emphasise that absorbtion.<br/>For years in my youth I felt Terry Riley&apos;s music was the real trailblazer<br/>toward that integration.</p><p>Well Haresh, I&apos;d like to know your elaboration on your interests.<br/>What is your conception and intuition of the relation between Indian raga<br/>and its contemporary relations?<br/>What is your background to tuning, experiment and sound creation as of the<br/>current time.<br/>Where exactly do you live?<br/>Can you tell us about your work, or an element of it , in this/these<br/>field/s.</p><p>In a spirit of friendly and open enquiry</p><p>Lawrence Ball</p><p>PS this is an OLT post (overlapping-topic).</p><p>&gt;&gt; I developed a series of Sound Mandalas during the 1980s which have<br/>&gt;a lot in<br/>&gt;&gt; common with tamboura and harmonic overtone singing.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;Hi Lawrence,  while Indian classical music may be entertaining, it is<br/>&gt;ONLY about meditation and samadhi.  More about this later, maybe.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;Right now, I am interested in Sound Mandalas, and &quot;tamboura and<br/>&gt;harmonic overtone singing&quot;.  Can you please elaborate?  I am also<br/>&gt;doing much work in this field.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;Thanks.<br/>&gt;Haresh.</p></div>
