I&apos;m not too surprised that<br/>9:12:16 would be an optimal triad, but something close to 22-tet a nice<br/>choice for a tetrad based on three fourths, with an outer interval close<br/>to 7:3, and this may confirm your original remark about 22-tet &quot;quartal<br/>harmony&quot; in your famous paper which got me interested in this question.</p><p>One question might be how much the septimal schisma or &quot;beta-2&quot; (~3.80<br/>cents) affects the consonance rating of Xeno-Gothic tetrads approximating<br/>12:14:18:21 or 14:18:21:24. These are unstable sonorities with an effect<br/>at once &quot;coloristic&quot; and often cadentially oriented toward a stable trine<br/>or fifth.</p><p>Anyway, thanks for another fascinating survey. Incidentally regarding the<br/>not-so-consonant qualities of the minor sixth: it is often ranked by<br/>13th-century theorists along with the minor second, major seventh, and<br/>tritone or diminished fifth as a strong dissonance. I wonder if the<br/>tension between the third partial of the lower note and the second partial<br/>of the upper note could contribute to this result, not only with a more<br/>complex ratio like the Pythagorean 128:81, but also with a pure 8:5.</p><p>Most appreciatively,</p><p>Margo Schulter<br/><a href="mailto:mschulter@value.net">mschulter@value.net</a></p></div>
