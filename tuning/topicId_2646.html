Look at your latest posts -- you&apos;re a slippery<br/>&gt; fellow!</p><p>I&apos;m not being slippery - I&apos;m just trying different lattice<br/>options  :)</p><p>The bottom line with me is, I designed my lattices as prime-<br/>factor because I felt that that was the simplest way of<br/>portraying the vast amount of harmonic information in a<br/>large JI system.</p><p>More and more as time goes on, however, I find that there<br/>is much value in assigning the Euclidean metric to different<br/>ratios on the lattice (what I&apos;ve been calling &apos;direct<br/>lattice connections&apos; lately).</p><p>Also, I inadvertently posted the first half of that message<br/>hours before it was finished, and didn&apos;t realize it.</p><p>&gt; In a full musical context, composites will most likely come into<br/>&gt; play more than higher primes. But that is by means of chains of<br/>&gt; connections, which the lattice can already display quite nicely.<br/>&gt; I prefer the lattice to be constructed devoid of any<br/>&gt; considerations of musical context, since those can always vary.<br/>&gt; Without context, I see (and more importantly, hear) no reason to<br/>&gt; consider composite simpler than primes with similar-sized numbers.</p><p>Ok, I think basically that makes sense and I can almost agree<br/>with it.  But it was you yourself who just complained recently<br/>about 9:5 having a longer metric than 11:5.  So it seems that<br/>really we&apos;re both looking for a lattice formula that would create<br/>a metric that&apos;s in between what we&apos;re already getting, your<br/>results being too large on one end and mine being too small<br/>on the other.</p><p>I&apos;d like to respond in-depth to the rest of your reply,<br/>but I won&apos;t have the time for the next couple of weeks because<br/>I&apos;m hard at work on my Walt Whitman piece for the AFMM.<br/>So I&apos;ll be scarce on the List for the rest of May.</p><p>-monz</p><p>Joseph L.
