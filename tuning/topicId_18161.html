FTS already does<br/>shepard tones in the Scale / Arpeggio playback config (double quaver next<br/>to play scale button) | Asc/Desc | Endlessly ascending / descending.</p><p>I&apos;d also be interested to know what the name is for discipline that deals with<br/>acoustical properties of materials.</p><p>Robert</p></div>
