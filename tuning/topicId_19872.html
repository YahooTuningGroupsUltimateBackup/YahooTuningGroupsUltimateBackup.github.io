I&apos;ve enjoyed the<br/>one on the newbie 12 notes question. I like the historical<br/>approach to these questions, really puts them in perspective.</p><p>I&apos;ll try it on a newbie friend or two.</p><p>&gt; I don&apos;t have the archive number right here, but if Daniel feels the<br/>&gt; FAQ is ready for posting a quick search, I am sure, will find it...</p><p>&gt; Were there any other &quot;completed&quot; ones that people recall??</p><p>&gt; And ROBERT, for now couldn&apos;t we just keep the tree on YOUR site??  I<br/>&gt; have no idea how large it&apos;s going to be, but right now it consists of<br/>&gt; mostly text.  It can&apos;t even be 1 meg yet.  Can&apos;t we keep it there<br/>&gt; until it gets to large for you to host it??</p><p>The working draft tree, yes, for a fair while, as it just consists<br/>of a list of urls and the descriptions to go in the tree.</p><p>For the on-site tree, and the ascii faq, no, not that site. I&apos;ve deleted<br/>a 1 Mb file which will make some space, but that wouldn&apos;t keep it going for long,<br/>only for a demo version.</p><p>Not that there is any particular hurry as I imagine it will be<br/>a little while before it runs out of space.</p><p>&gt; Just wondering...</p><p>&gt; Even already, it&apos;s a great tool to refer new people to.  We can just<br/>&gt; give them the link as their first &quot;welcome&quot; post!  Well, maybe it<br/>&gt; needs just a bit more &quot;filling in&quot; before it&apos;s ready for that...</p><p>GReat.</p><p>Back to the programming then,....</p><p>Robert</p></div>
