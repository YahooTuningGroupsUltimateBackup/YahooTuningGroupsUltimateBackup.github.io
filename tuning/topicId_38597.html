Suitable for ages 8-12.</p><p>Saturday 7 September - Peebles Arts Festival - performance and workshop<br/>in the grounds and hall of the Leckie Memorial Church, Peebles from 11am<br/>- 1230pm. Performance by the Eastgate Hall between 2 and 4pm.</p><p>Tuesday 24 September - Borders Storytelling Festival - The Salmon Inn,<br/>Galashiels between 8 and 1030pm - an evening of new music and<br/>storytelling from Africa.</p><p>Traquair fair is a big new agey hippy festival with lots of interesting<br/>acts, like the Japanese Taiko Drummers they had last year. Should be<br/>good for meeting people. The Chapel, part of the Scotland&apos;s oldest<br/>inhabited house, should be an excellent acoustic.</p><p>At the Borders Storytelling Festival we&apos;re sharing the stage with a<br/>Ghanaian storyteller, drummer, singer. Time to look out my favourite Ewe<br/>patterns.<br/>Humble beginnings, but think local act global comes to mind. I&apos;m busy<br/>trying to fill out the autumn months with engagements and educational<br/>initiatives.</p><p>It&apos;s microtonal, it&apos;s Just Intonation (as near as my tuner allows) and<br/>the public so far seem to love the music, despite the fact that we<br/>haven&apos;t yet played any of my compositions yet, only structured<br/>improvisations and to a small mixed audience.</p><p>I&apos;ll post later on some of the reactions once the &quot;fundamentalist&quot; stuff<br/>dies down as I don&apos;t feel in the mood for a carping session.</p><p>BTW - you are all cordially invited.</p><p>Kind Regards</p></div>
