As<br/>this is meant to address both the desire to try a lot of differing ratio<br/>scenarios, and an inability to afford anything vaguely resembling a real JI<br/>custom job&#xFFFD;</p><p>Any  guitar costing upwards of 75$ should be immediately and permanently<br/>dislodged from this discussion: tout-de-suite! (I used a 35$ Zim-Gar nylon<br/>string&#xFFFD;)</p><p>Mini-staples, or staple tots are the rather enfeebled munitions of miniature<br/>staplers. They were also ratio stops on the Zim-Gar.</p><p>A couple of forewarnings gleaned from trial and tribulation:</p><p>1)  You will certainly benefit from some reliable form of pitch reference<br/>(such as a tunable keyboard***). For it has been my experience that the<br/>intonational accuracy of (mathematically precise) string ratios fluctuate<br/>quite a bit more than one might anticipate - especially on inexpensive<br/>guitars.</p><p>2)  Before you start taking the strings off (or loosening the string<br/>tension) to start tapping in the faux fretlets, you might want to lightly<br/>mark the entire horizontal run of the strings down the fingerboard to best<br/>approximate where the fretlets should sit (as the strings fan out from the<br/>nut to the bridge).</p><p>3)  To fine-tune and (fine) mark the intervals, I bend a paper clip at the<br/>shoulder and (with the guitar lying on its back) slide the straight section<br/>under the string. This serves the dual purpose of being both [potentially&#xFFFD;]<br/>very precise, and ready-made for making a straight line.</p><p>4)  With the greatest of care (and the most tolerant of temperaments!), the<br/>mini-staples will hammer straight into the fretboard. But as this is<br/>somewhat akin to Kwai Chang walking on rice paper, sooner or later your<br/>probably going to start twisting, buckling, and crumpling them over&#xFFFD; With a<br/>combination of luck, will, and practice, attempt to discourage them from<br/>folding towards the headstock or the soundhole&#xFFFD; If they have crumpled within<br/>earshot of their destination: Start hammering. This will smooth out (smash<br/>in) any crimps or crinkles.</p><p>5)  I found that stopping heptads**** and other perhaps less ambitious<br/>tuning scenarios,***** makes the process of pulling them all out and sanding<br/>down the damage (so you can start all over again&#xFFFD;), a far less dispiriting<br/>devoir.</p><p>Respectfully,<br/>DAN STEARNS</p><p>PS Should your fretboard cleave in half and your truss rod roll to the<br/>floor&#xFFFD; I reserve the right to deny ever having written any of this.</p><p>*Perhaps &quot;Did It Myself&quot; is more appropriate here, as I&#xFFFD;m not so sure this<br/>(Neanderthal) method constitutes the soundest advise&#xFFFD; Nevertheless: It does<br/>work.</p><p>**I&#xFFFD;ve also used this to &#xFFFD;freely&#xFFFD; stop intervals of my own liking. (Tuned by<br/>listening until I found something I deemed &#xFFFD;attractive&#xFFFD;&#xFFFD;)</p><p>***I also tune the adjacent open string to a unison of the open string I&#xFFFD;m<br/>marking ratios for, as it seems to me that I can sometimes &#xFFFD;hear&#xFFFD; the<br/>interval &#xFFFD;better&#xFFFD; against a 1/1 of the same (timbre) species. But this is<br/>really a rather limited sort of double-check that won&#xFFFD;t help you much in<br/>distinguishing a 15/14 from a 16/15, and as 1/15th or 1/16th the distance<br/>from the nut to the saddle may or may not stop a 15/14 or a 16/15... the use<br/>of a reliable pitch reference is highly desirable.</p><p>****The last tuning I used on the (now deceased) Zim-Gar was the main tuning<br/>(1/1, 8/7, 9/7, 7/5, 32/21, 12/7, 27/14, 2/1) I was using to rework an older<br/>arrangement I had done of Lowell Mason&#xFFFD;s &#xFFFD;Work For the Night is Coming&#xFFFD;.<br/>This tuning is featured in the second verse in a sort of polymodal style,<br/>where the guitars take G as the 1/1, and the tenor holds D as the 1/1 (G, A,<br/>B, C#, D, E, F#, G and D, E, F#, G#, A, B, C#, D respectfully). The guitar<br/>was tuned:</p><p>E @ 12/7 (+ 4/3 =)<br/>A @ 8/7 (+ 4/3 =)<br/>D @ 32/21 (+ 21/16 =)<br/>G @ 1/1 (+ 9/7 =)<br/>B @ 9/7 (+ 4/3 =)<br/>E @ 12/7</p><p>*****However it is possible (hit or miss, as sometimes the dips and bends of<br/>the neck coincide with your desires and sometimes they don&#xFFFD;t) to place stops<br/>quite close to each other&#xFFFD; In fact I&#xFFFD;d say as close as your probably apt to<br/>&#xFFFD;fret&#xFFFD;. (Which is somewhat different than &#xFFFD;play&#xFFFD;, as on a fretless guitar<br/>you can very subtly roll your finger to achieve wonderfully infinitesimal<br/>gradations of pitch inflection.)</p></div>
