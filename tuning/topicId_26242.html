The 450 plus membership and its<br/>promise of an interested but silent contingency was a sham... I doubt<br/>that there&apos;s ever more than 25 or 35 active members, with about half<br/>that actually being regular participants.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Let&apos;s face it folks, it&apos;s a pretty darned microscopic microtonal<br/>&gt; community we have here, well at least as it&apos;s represented by the<br/>&gt; online contingency anyway...<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; --Dan Stearns</p><p>I dunno, Dan... this may or may not be an accurate representation of<br/>the &quot;silent majority...&quot;</p><p>The lists states that 469 people are subscribed... that&apos;s up about<br/>100 since I joined a couple years ago...</p><p>Why, if these people aren&apos;t interested, do they still SUBSCRIBE??</p><p>I&apos;m assuming that most of them get the list via e-mail rather than<br/>Web access.  I could understand it if the majority were Web access --<br/>since people could just sign up and forget about it.</p><p>But even of the 25-35 &quot;regulars&quot; here... the MAJORITY, so it seems,<br/>still get an e-mail version...  Since this seems the case, why<br/>wouldn&apos;t it pertain to the others, by extension, as well??</p><p>So, if all these people are getting Tuning List e-mail in their in-<br/>boxes, they *must* be at least moderately interested... or they would<br/>UNSUBSCRIBE... rather than fill their in-boxes with more &quot;spam...&quot;<br/>wouldn&apos;t they??</p><p>Am I missing something??</p><p>Thanks!</p><p>_________ ______ _______<br/>Joseph Pehrson</p></div><h3><a id=26243 href="#26243">ðŸ”—</a>David Beardsley &#x3C;davidbeardsley@biink.com&#x3E;</h3><span>7/16/2001 1:14:32 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>----- Original Message -----<br/>From: &lt;<a href="mailto:jpehrson@rcn.com">jpehrson@rcn.com</a>&gt;</p><p>&gt; Why, if these people aren&apos;t interested, do they still SUBSCRIBE??</p><p>They probably just let the email pile up on their hard drive.<br/>They&apos;re interested, just not very serious.</p><p>David Beardsley<br/><a href="http://mp3.com/davidbeardsley">http://mp3.com/davidbeardsley</a></p></div><h3><a id=26244 href="#26244">ðŸ”—</a>Jon Szanto &#x3C;JSZANTO@ADNC.COM&#x3E;</h3><span>7/16/2001 1:17:41 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Joe,</p><p>--- In tuning@y..., jpehrson@r... wrote:<br/>&gt; So, if all these people are getting Tuning List e-mail in their in-<br/>&gt; boxes, they *must* be at least moderately interested... or they<br/>&gt; would UNSUBSCRIBE... rather than fill their in-boxes with<br/>&gt; more &quot;spam...&quot; wouldn&apos;t they??<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Am I missing something??</p><p>One thing you are missing, at least in your description, is that with<br/>Yahoo Groups one option is to be a member of the list but receive no<br/>email. I have taken to doing this on almost all of the splinter<br/>groups, as by being a member I can post, download files, etc., but I<br/>can just browse the msgs. I don&apos;t really have enough interest to<br/>reply, but can scan topic headers (more reason to have them<br/>pertinent) to see if there is anything of interest.</p><p>Another thing: many people who receive individual emails have filters<br/>setup in their email programs to automatically place those in the<br/>trash they so designate. Filters can be setup on who the email is<br/>from, so particular &apos;correspondents&apos; get dumped before even being<br/>read. I know, because people have told me this about the list.</p><p>The more they have to filter, the less inclined they are to be<br/>involved. And, yes, many just stay subbed and let the stuff pile up.</p><p>Cheers,<br/>Jon</p></div><h3><a id=26266 href="#26266">ðŸ”—</a>David Bowen &#x3C;dmb@sgi.com&#x3E;</h3><span>7/17/2001 6:46:45 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Well, I&apos;m one of the mostly silent members of this list.

Please describe the tuning, including how it maps<br/>&gt; to the mouth organ.</p><p>It started out as a cheap diatonic mouth organ (blues harp) in C major.<br/>(I think, if it was another key adjust the following accordingly.)  The<br/>way the tuning works, you can play C, G and Dm chords.  So I retuned it so<br/>that the thirds of those chords became neutral.  That gives you a neutral<br/>third MOS like the one that started this thread, although in 24-equal<br/>rather than 31-equal.</p><p>I find it works very well, because beats between reeds are an important<br/>feature of the sound of a mouth organ.  I also have a double-reed model<br/>that I retuned to 5-limit JI.  It has a distinctive sound, may be useful<br/>in some context, but thin on its own and not very mouth organ-ish.</p><p>Despite my efforts to hide it with a filter, you can hear in the example<br/>where I played some &quot;wrong notes&quot; that don&apos;t form a neutral-third triad.<br/>For some reason, neutral-third triads do sound &quot;right&quot; with very little<br/>acculturation.  This is the secret to neutral third scales functioning as<br/>diatonics.  Robert Walker&apos;s recent files actually demonstrate this quite<br/>well, although he&apos;s using a 13-limit rationalisation I haven&apos;t considered.</p><p>The updated URL for retuning mouth organs is<br/>&lt;<a href="http://www.patmissin.com/tunings.html">http://www.patmissin.com/tunings.html</a>&gt;.
