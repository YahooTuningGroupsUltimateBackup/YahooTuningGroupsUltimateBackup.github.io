Yes, I agree, at that pitch.</p><p>Indeed, at any fixed pitch I expect.</p><p>So I thought I&apos;d try them at random pitches as well, to see if I do any better<br/>than major / minor, which I still can&apos;t get completely out of context (can&apos;t do<br/>4/3 and 6/5 even).</p><p>However, I can&apos;t do that yet - for me the consonance / otherwise of this chord<br/>is overwhelmed by the absolute pitch timbre of its notes, when completely<br/>out of any context.</p><p>Sometimes in the random chord quiz, I hear the otonal chord, then hear<br/>the next chord shifted in pitch by a smallish amount, and I immediately<br/>say &quot;utonal&quot; on the basis of the kind of overal timbre of the chord,<br/>and in fact it is the &quot;otonal&quot; one again with the pitch timbres all changed.<br/>(I can tell if an otonal and a utonal one are played one after another at<br/>the same pitch.)</p><p>Tried adding a few more pitches to make, say, a seven note otonal chord<br/>from the harmonic series, and compare it with a utonal one, and it still<br/>doesn&apos;t work for me.</p><p>So I&apos;m not a very good subject for experiments in this area unfortunately!</p><p>However I agree with the conclusion that the otonal chord is more<br/>consonant than the utonal one even with this small chord of four<br/>notes.</p><p>It is just that for me, pitch timbres can easily overwhelm<br/>the comparatively smaller effect of consonance of otonal and utonal chords.<br/>which makes it a bit less clear to hear, at least, when the chords<br/>are presented in isolation.</p><p>But I can tell the difference between major and minor triad played<br/>as a melody at any absolute pitch, if you add just a few extra melodic<br/>notes immediately after it.</p><p>E.g. in just intonation 12 t, I can immediately distinguish degrees<br/>0 4 7 9 7 4 from 0 3 7 9 7 3 in nearly all random transpositions<br/>(all except about one or two out of ten)<br/>but often get muddled between 0 4 7 and 0 3 7</p><p>Even between 0 3 and 0 5 (minor third and fourth).</p><p>Indeed, 0 4 7 9 7 and 0 3 7 9 7 also confuse me, so it<br/>isn&apos;t the actual pitches so much as the need to have a bit<br/>of a melodic line to make some intervalic sense out of them.</p><p>Adding one extra note makes all the difference!</p><p>But I think I&apos;m getting there - beginning to anticipate what the chord is<br/>going to turn out to be before the end of the melodic line...</p><p>I wonder, might the extra consonance of the otonal chord, and relative<br/>somewhat dissonance, or &quot;sadness / tenderness&quot; of a minor chord somehow play<br/>a stronger role when it is in the context of a piece of music, or even, used<br/>as a melodic line, than it does in an isolated chord?</p><p>Robert</p></div><h3><a id=18140 href="#18140">ðŸ”—</a>Paul H.
