(Vibrato might take you some time to master, in any case.)<br/>H. Lowery, in &quot;A Guide to Musical Acoustics&quot; (Dobson Books, Ltd. , London, 1956) writes on page 82:<br/>       &quot;In this instrument the vibrato may contribute most artistically to performance for its extent and frequency of oscillation are entirely under the control of the player.  Beats up to about seven per second yield satisfactory results with a pitch range of not more than a semitone on either side.&quot;<br/>At the head of Chapter I the author quotes Clerk Maxwell:<br/>&quot;The special educational value of this combined study of music and acoustics is that more than almost any other study it involves a continued appeal to what we must observe ourselves.  The facts are things which must be felt:  they cannot be learned from any description of them.&quot;</p><p>&gt;&gt;&gt; &quot;Christopher J.
