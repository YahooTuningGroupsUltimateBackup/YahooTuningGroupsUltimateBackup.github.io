As a biologist,<br/>I had to take quite a few chemistry and physics classes, and, therefore, I<br/>am acquainted with the scientific notion of energy. For instance, chemically<br/>speaking you have to increase energy to go from one stable state of atoms in<br/>a compound to another, something we call a chemical reaction. Stable states<br/>have low energy, unstable ones have high energy.</p><p>Now, doing research on intervals I observed that if you play two tones in<br/>alternation (keep one tone stable, move the other slowly upwards) so that<br/>there&apos;s no acoustic overlap, you will still notice something that H. Husmann<br/>called &quot;Lichtpunkte&quot; (points of light)--which correlate to simple integer<br/>pitch ratios (SIPR; I try to avoid the term frequency for psychoacoustical<br/>reasons). This phenomenon reveals our brains&apos; ability to process harmony<br/>even in absence of difference tones, beatings and other secondary harmonic<br/>cues.</p><p>The absolute intensities of these &quot;points of light&quot; seem to correlates to<br/>Barlow&apos;s harmonicity values, whereas their relative intensities seem to<br/>increase as you approach the SIPR and decrease as you leave it. This lead me<br/>to, first, invert Barlow&apos;s harmonicity formula to derive a harmonic energy<br/>function (the &quot;brighter&quot; and stable the SIPR the lower its energy), and<br/>second, to apply a bell curve around each SIPR. Doing this for all strong<br/>intervals within a given interval range yields an &quot;energy landscape&quot; with<br/>&quot;dimples&quot; and &quot;craters.&quot;</p><p>I also took several psychoacoustical and cognitive factors, determining the<br/>depth and width of these local minima, into consideration (and that&apos;s a<br/>major departure from most math-based theories of<br/>harmonicity/consonance/corcordance). I merged these factors into the term<br/>&quot;pitch strength.&quot;</p><p>A tuning (be it equidistant or not) consists of a set of pitches that can be<br/>placed into local energy minima. To calculate the total energy of a tuning,<br/>one has to compute the (combinatorial) energy of all possible interval<br/>combinations.</p><p>I published a ranking of these tunings (relevance) with different pitch<br/>strengths in my paper &quot;Low Energy and Equal Spacing.&quot; What was most<br/>important and gratifying for me, was that, despite their scientific<br/>derivation, the results are pretty consistent with the historical evolution<br/>of music.</p><p>A few years after writing my paper, I was exposed to the theory of<br/>backpropagation neural networks and I learned that the term &quot;energy&quot; is<br/>commonly used to describe the state of a network. It&apos;s the goal that in the<br/>training phase (the phase during which the training values are presented to<br/>the network), it will come as close as possible to reproducing those values<br/>by first setting weights for all the connections randomly and then<br/>optimizing them towards a local or, ideally, a global minimum.</p><p>It&apos;s a fact that the neurons which are responsible for harmonic perception<br/>(lined up like organ pipes in our cortex) also respond to stimuli that are<br/>slightly off. Ultimately, the quality of the tuning in a musical situation<br/>depends on the response of the network of neurons, i.e. on their energy<br/>state. That&apos;s why I never believed in purely mathematical theories of<br/>consonance. Nonetheless, the theory of neural networks is also based on<br/>math; everything is just a little more complicated.</p><p>Georg</p><p>&gt;<br/>&gt; Thanks Georg. Now I wonder if<br/>&gt; you&apos;d care to comment on your<br/>&gt; application of Barlow&apos;s function<br/>&gt; to your paper. You seem to be<br/>&gt; after a notion of &quot;consonance&quot;,<br/>&gt; and bring up some recent<br/>&gt; psychoacoustic concepts in<br/>&gt; defining it, yet rather than<br/>&gt; investigating the mathematics of<br/>&gt; these phenomena themselves,<br/>&gt; you bring in Barlow&apos;s function to<br/>&gt; stand for consonance. Can you<br/>&gt; elaborate on your reasoning<br/>&gt; behind this move?</p></div><h3>Paul H.

The main reason I asked is that I view with<br/>extreme suspicion the idea that hearing a particular frequency ratio, or<br/>approximation thereof, leads to anything like a &quot;mental representation&quot; of<br/>the numbers in the ratio -- and particularly the idea that the absolute<br/>primality of the numerator or the absolute primality of the denominator<br/>could have perceptual relevance. I have argued these points to death on this<br/>list, but my viewpoint is matched by the psychoacoustically derived dyadic<br/>consonance functions of Helmholtz, Plomp, Kameoka &amp; Kuriyagawa, Sethares,<br/>and Parncutt (as well as, incidentally, the more abstract one of Tenney, and<br/>the empirical &quot;one-footed bride&quot; of Partch) which show no special provision<br/>for primality, and I&apos;m rather convinced that perceptions of ratios such as<br/>9:8, 9:5, and 15:8 are biased due to their familiarity from Western music,<br/>and from experience with the simple _musical_ (i.e. not purely _perceptual_)<br/>operation of stacking musical intervals on one another. That is, if you&apos;ve<br/>never heard a fourth and a fifth played in succession with one note in<br/>common, you&apos;d never know that a major second was reducible in terms of<br/>simpler intervals -- in Kantian terms, you might say the reduction is<br/>&quot;synthetic&quot; and not &quot;analytic&quot;.</p><p>&gt;I also took several psychoacoustical and cognitive factors, determining the<br/>&gt;depth and width of these local minima, into consideration (and that&apos;s a<br/>&gt;major departure from most math-based theories of<br/>&gt;harmonicity/consonance/corcordance). I merged these factors into the term<br/>&gt;&quot;pitch strength.&quot;</p><p>If you&apos;re referring to the finite tolerance of the hearing resolution,<br/>certainly Helmholtz, Plomp, Kameoka &amp; Kuriyagawa, Sethares, and even Partch<br/>produced _continuous_ consonance curves which acknowledge this finite<br/>tolerance. You may be interested in learning about my &quot;Harmonic Entropy&quot;<br/>function, a curious parallel to your &quot;energy&quot; function. There is an entire<br/>newsgroup dedicated to the concept, <a href="mailto:harmonic_entropy@yahoogroups.com">harmonic_entropy@yahoogroups.com</a>, I hope<br/>you will join and look at the archives. A very outdated compilation of early<br/>posts on the subject to this list is available at<br/><a href="http://www.ixpres.com/interval/td/entropy.htm">http://www.ixpres.com/interval/td/entropy.htm</a> -- it&apos;s sorely in need of<br/>revision, but should give you a start. The beauty of this formulation, I<br/>feel, is that not only does it exploit the information-theoretic concept of<br/>&quot;entropy&quot; (synonymous with confusion) to model dissonance, but it does so<br/>extremely elegantly with essentially only one free parameter -- you guessed<br/>it -- the standard deviation of the uncertainty in the hearing resolution.</p><p>&gt;A tuning (be it equidistant or not) consists of a set of pitches that can<br/>be<br/>&gt;placed into local energy minima. To calculate the total energy of a tuning,<br/>&gt;one has to compute the (combinatorial) energy of all possible interval<br/>&gt;combinations.</p><p>Would you agree that for a 12-tone scale, you&apos;d have 66 dyads to evaluate? A<br/>few months ago I did a set of such optimizations for locally minimizing the<br/>total dyadic harmonic entropy using starting points that were various N-tone<br/>equal tempered scales. Among the interesting &quot;relaxed&quot; scales obtained were<br/>pentatonic and heptatonic &quot;diatonic&quot; scales in approximately meantone<br/>tuning, while for most values of N the equal tuning proved to be a local<br/>minimum (since bettering one interval here would inevitable worsen another<br/>interval there). I&apos;m preparing to review the results in a little more detail<br/>in response to Darren McDougall&apos;s query . . .</p></div><h3>David C Keenan &#x3C;D.KEENAN@UQ.NET.AU&#x3E;</h3><span>1/31/2001 9:05:01 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Dear Georg Hajdu,</p><p>Good to have you on the list.</p><p>You use the term simple integer pitch ratios (SIPR) and say that you try to<br/>avoid the term frequency for psychoacoustical reasons. But you really are<br/>talking about frequency ratios, aren&apos;t you? As I understand it the percept<br/>of pitch is considered to have an approximately logarithmic relationship to<br/>frequency and is affected by factors other than frequency. Also why<br/>integers? There is no meaning attached to negative numbers. How about small<br/>whole-number frequency ratios (SWFRs).</p><p>You wrote:</p><p>&gt;Hence, Barlow&apos;s (scientifically unproven, but irrefutable) assumption that<br/>an analogous mechanism also determines the<br/>harmonicity/consonance/concordance of an interval, and the<br/>&gt;                 &quot;metrical affinity&quot; of simultaneous meters.</p><p>I assume you mean that, assuming Barlow&apos;s indigestibility accurately models<br/>musicians perception of the relative consonance of dyads (vertical<br/>intervals) with small whole-number frequency ratios (SWFRs), it is<br/>irrefutable whether the mechanism is as he suggests. But the assertion that<br/>Barlow&apos;s indigestibility does accurately model musicians perception of the<br/>relative consonance of dyads is certainly refutable. And I believe it has<br/>been adequately refuted on this list. In fact all prime-factorisation based<br/>measures have been pretty much rejected in the case of dyads. The product<br/>of the two numbers appears to be the best measure (or any monotonic<br/>function of that), except that ratios where the smaller number is a power<br/>of two appear to be at a slight advantage.</p><p>Paul Erlich and I (and possibly others) expect that prime-factor based<br/>measures result only when musicians are simply asked to rank the consonance<br/>of intervals from memory, rather than by a/b comparison listening to bare<br/>dyads. The fact is that IN CHORDS, ratios whose sides have many small prime<br/>factors are more likely to allow factors to cancel in OTHER dyads within<br/>the chord. e.g. 8:15 is not consonant in itself but will readily take part<br/>in chords where the other intervals are very consonant (have very simple<br/>ratios) because it can cancel 2&apos;s, 3&apos;s and 5&apos;s.</p><p>The following URL points to a zipped Excel spreadsheet which compares (on<br/>charts) all of the formulae we could find which purported to model the<br/>relative consonance of SWFRs.

Since I am more a composer<br/>with psychoacoustic awareness rather than a researcher with musical<br/>awareness, the statements I am going to make will be somewhat aphoristic.</p><p>I&apos;m not surprised that someone else has developed his own concept of<br/>harmonic energy/entropy. The analogy to physics/chemistry is so obvious, it<br/>was meant to happen.</p><p>The question is to what degree do perceptual and cognitive aspects of<br/>harmonic hearing interact with and influence each other?<br/>Please believe me, I never stop wondering whether an interval such as 32/27<br/>is a mental reality or not. Sometimes I am inclined to think it&apos;s just a<br/>mathematical construction with little perceptual relevance.</p><p>But on the other hand, very well-trained musicians are able to mentally<br/>track the stacking of fifths in complex musical situations (such as<br/>modulations) and are well aware of mistakes or deviations--so they argue<br/>(something that would be very difficult to show with psychoacoustical<br/>experiments). Hence, I wouldn&apos;t dismiss mental/cognitive abilities in the<br/>processing of non SIPRs (or WNFRs), or call it synthetic as opposed to<br/>analytical in Kantian terms.</p><p>I tend to compare this ability to a football player trying to catch a ball<br/>while running, solely relying on his mental ability to calculate its<br/>trajectory.</p><p>I haven&apos;t been following the discussion on the tuning site for a long time,<br/>I&apos;m not sure what the current agreements or disagreements are. Yet, it seems<br/>to me that it is absolutely necessary to differentiate between simultaneous<br/>and sequential harmonic events.</p><p>The phenomenon I&apos;m most interested in is short-term memory or<br/>ultra-short-term memory, which comes into play when you hear pitches in<br/>SUCCESSION (I am NOT talking about SIMULTANEOUS dyads--no beatings and<br/>difference tones involved). Thus, harmonic perception is purely mental,<br/>achieved by overlap of an active synthesis process in the brain.</p><p>Time and again, I tried to verify the results shown by my continuous<br/>consonance curve by this little experiment:<br/>While I was playing the alternating pitch sequence I described earlier on<br/>this list (let two tones alternate without acoustical overlap, leave one<br/>tone stable, increase the other one gradually by one-cent increments), I<br/>displayed the consonance curve on the computer display and redrew the curve<br/>while the alternating note was increasing in pitch.</p><p>Now, I critically asked myself whether I could hear a correspondence between<br/>the two. And indeed, I felt that there was a pretty good match. I<br/>subsequently showed that Barlow and others who confirmed my observation.</p><p>This procedure may not stand scientific scrutiny. Although, it&apos;s worth<br/>mentioning that I also perceived discrepancies, especially around 600 cents.<br/>For me, the tempered tritone was definitely more consonant than the<br/>&quot;dimples&quot; corresponding to the 7/5 and 10/7 ratios. This supports the idea<br/>that preferences for certain intervals are culturally acquired after all.</p><p>Now, my theory is that the neural networks in our brains are constantly<br/>&quot;trained&quot; with, at least, two different training materials: Firstly, a<br/>&quot;natural training set&quot; which is based on the ubiquitous harmonic series and<br/>which may also be responsible for our preference for SIPRs, and secondly, a<br/>&quot;culturally-determined training set&quot; which is based on &quot;irrational&quot;<br/>intervals which we get used to through repetition.</p><p>These two training sets compete with one another, and eventually,<br/>&quot;irrational&quot; intervals find entry into tuning systems if they contribute to<br/>their low energy (or entropy), as can be argued in the case of the<br/>&quot;irrational&quot; 600ct tritone.</p><p>If you have a stronger &quot;natural&quot; interval in the vicinity of an &quot;irrational&quot;<br/>one, the natural one may have the upper hand, though.</p><p>Based on these findings, one could devise the following experiment (does<br/>anyone like to volunteer?):<br/>Test subjects listen to the alternating pitch sequence (described above) and<br/>use an entry device such as the arrow keys on a computer keyboard to<br/>indicate whether they perceived a relative increase or decrease of<br/>consonance.</p><p>I hope I&apos;m not reinventing the wheel though.</p><p>Georg</p><p>***************************************************<br/>Phone:<br/>+49-251-48233-0 (w)<br/>+49-2506-85758 (h)<br/>+49-172-787-4214 (m)</p><p>Fax: +49-251-48233-30<br/>e-mail: <a href="mailto:hajdu@uni-muenster.de">hajdu@uni-muenster.de</a><br/><a href="http://www.mhs-muenster.de/Hajdu.html">http://www.mhs-muenster.de/Hajdu.html</a><br/>****************************************************</p></div><h3>Paul H.

Hence, I wouldn&apos;t dismiss mental/cognitive abilities in the<br/>&gt;processing of non SIPRs (or WNFRs), or call it synthetic as opposed to<br/>&gt;analytical in Kantian terms.</p><p>Georg, are you saying that musicians who attempt to play some kind of<br/>untempered, just intonation music have an acutity in detecting deviations<br/>from 32/27 in the result of stacking three fifths that is _greater_ than the<br/>acuity one would expect from applying the acuity with which they detect<br/>deviations from 3/2 or 4/3 applied three times? If not, I see no need to<br/>impose an &quot;extra&quot; mechanism.</p><p>&gt;The phenomenon I&apos;m most interested in is short-term memory or<br/>&gt;ultra-short-term memory, which comes into play when you hear pitches in<br/>&gt;SUCCESSION (I am NOT talking about SIMULTANEOUS dyads--no beatings and<br/>&gt;difference tones involved). Thus, harmonic perception is purely mental,<br/>&gt;achieved by overlap of an active synthesis process in the brain.</p><p>Well, it&apos;s good to be clear on that, since your paper didn&apos;t give that<br/>impression. My concern has been with SIMULTANEOUS dyads -- as I believe<br/>factors of melody, such as diatonicity, come into play whenever one heas a<br/>SUCCESSION. Ignoring that, though, I see no need to go &quot;beyond&quot; what each<br/>simple interval in the chain would imply. If 32/27 _isn&apos;t_ obtained by a<br/>stacking of fifths, or by first-hand experience with stacking fifths, why<br/>treat it any differently than, say, 31/26?</p><p>&gt;This procedure may not stand scientific scrutiny. Although, it&apos;s worth<br/>&gt;mentioning that I also perceived discrepancies, especially around 600<br/>cents.<br/>&gt;For me, the tempered tritone was definitely more consonant than the<br/>&gt;&quot;dimples&quot; corresponding to the 7/5 and 10/7 ratios. This supports the idea<br/>&gt;that preferences for certain intervals are culturally acquired after all.</p><p>It would also be consistent with the harmonic entropy calculations<br/>associated with a fairly poor hearing resolution -- one sees a local minimum<br/>_between_ 7/5 and 10/7. But your interpretation supports my assertion above<br/>about the tritone.</p><p>&gt;I haven&apos;t been following the discussion on the tuning site for a long time,<br/>&gt;I&apos;m not sure what the current agreements or disagreements are.</p><p>It&apos;s too bad you weren&apos;t around during the heady days of this discussion.<br/>You may want to look at the archives should you care to pick up on any of<br/>these threads and bring up any issues with me, Dave, or anyone else.</p><p>By the way, I&apos;m still awaiting a response to this:</p><p>&gt;&gt;A tuning (be it equidistant or not) consists of a set of pitches that can<br/>be<br/>&gt;&gt;placed into local energy minima. To calculate the total energy of a<br/>tuning,<br/>&gt;&gt;one has to compute the (combinatorial) energy of all possible interval<br/>&gt;&gt;combinations.</p><p>&gt;Would you agree that for a 12-tone scale, you&apos;d have 66 dyads to evaluate?<br/>A<br/>&gt;few months ago I did a set of such optimizations for locally minimizing the<br/>&gt;total dyadic harmonic entropy using starting points that were various<br/>N-tone<br/>&gt;equal tempered scales. Among the interesting &quot;relaxed&quot; scales obtained were<br/>&gt;pentatonic and heptatonic &quot;diatonic&quot; scales in approximately meantone<br/>&gt;tuning, while for most values of N the equal tuning proved to be a local<br/>&gt;minimum (since bettering one interval here would inevitable worsen another<br/>&gt;interval there).

Based on Goldstein&apos;s work, it seems that a standard<br/>deviation of 1.5% could be considered &quot;average&quot; in a generalist context. And the harmonic<br/>entropy curve associated with this standard deviation indeed shows 9:11 as relatively<br/>concordant, since it lies in the overlap of the 4:5 valley and the 5:6 valley . . . considering that we<br/>have not made any particular assumptions about timbre, register, or duration, I think we&apos;ve done<br/>amazingly well at explaining our perceptions -- don&apos;t you agree?</p></div><h3>PERLICH@ACADIAN-ASSET.COM</h3><span>2/10/2001 12:52:10 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In tuning@y..., &quot;D.Stearns&quot; &lt;STEARNS@C...&gt; wrote:</p><p>&gt; I think a product limit only gives mostly the right answers if you lop<br/>&gt; it off at the point where things start to get difficult (or<br/>&gt; interesting).</p><p>The word &quot;limit&quot; already carries with it the implication that you lop things off at some point.
