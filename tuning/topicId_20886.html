The advertising doesn&apos;t bother me at all,<br/>either, since, after all, it pays for the space.  It&apos;s great that the<br/>space is unlimited.</p><p>I&apos;m having one slight problem with the site.  It doesn&apos;t work well<br/>with Netscape 4.7...  It freezes up the computer when trying to<br/>access more than one message, particularly on the &quot;first&quot; and &quot;last&quot;<br/>message designations.</p><p>There is no problem with the more recent release, Netscape 6.<br/>Probably I will have to use that if I wish to work with the archives.<br/>I use Netscape 4.7 because I prefer the fonts and it also is a<br/>smaller program, so I can have more than one version of it running at<br/>the same time... to access different things for reference.</p><p>Do you think there is any way that problem could be fixed??</p><p>I notice that in Internet Explorer there is also no problem.</p><p>I wonder what causes this??  In any case, like I say, I can easily<br/>switch to a different browser, but it would be great if it would work<br/>with Netscape 4.7....</p><p>Great job, though.  NOW, it would be terrific if somehow all the<br/>MILLS POSTS could be included on the same site.</p><p>Is that possible??

Well, not too much is happening with<br/>&gt; that nowadays... it&apos;s losing steam.</p><p>Perhaps, I&apos;ll be doing a bit more programming on the FAQ tree program<br/>after this, hopefully only needs another day or so, but we&apos;ll see.</p><p>Then maybe others might like to have a try running it to make<br/>the tree on their hard disk? Also to try the option to edit the tree to<br/>make custom versions which one could then print out,<br/>with whichever sections one most wanted to read.</p><p>You can always try adding a few of the faq drafts to the files area<br/>and to the database yourself, but then of course the original writers of<br/>them won&apos;t be able to edit them.</p><p>I think we aren&apos;t sure exactly what John&apos;s plans are, but if<br/>I understand correctly, his idea is that one should post a<br/>faq to the TL first if poss. and then either at same time<br/>or later, add it to the tree.</p><p>At any rate, seems appropriate to add the ones that have been<br/>discussed at length to the tree. The original drafters of them,<br/>if they want their entries in the tree, need to upload them to<br/>a url, such as the files area of the TL, or anywhwer else on the<br/>WWW. Or else if they want someone else to take on the task of<br/>uploading them for whatever reason, they need to say so.</p><p>Note to faq drafters:</p><p>A good place would be under files area / faq / your name<br/>Make sure you leave no spaces in your name, as the spaces<br/>confuse the applet, replace them by underlines as robert_walker<br/>and also replace spaces by underlines in the file names.<br/>There&apos;s nothing we can do about this unless someone writes<br/>a new version of the tree applet without this limitation.</p><p>One doesn&apos;t have to fill in the form with the details,<br/>as it is only a matter of a few minutes for either of us<br/>to do it. Could be helpful if one said which folder on<br/>the tree one wanted the entry to go into, or what name<br/>to give for a new folder, if one thinks one is needed,<br/>as whoever adds it to the tree will have to make that decision<br/>for you otherwise.</p><p>When I get back to work on the FAQ tree, I&apos;ll add an option to<br/>add an entry to the working draft tree only, which one can<br/>use if it is just a try out of an idea. Then it can remain<br/>there for comment for a while, then can be either removed<br/>(perhaps to be recycled to use for other entries later) or<br/>added to the on site tree.</p><p>&gt; I think we need a few more willing &quot;content providers...&quot;</p><p>I have a few ideas of things I might add (e.g. perhaps the<br/>material I did on how to find the number of subsets<br/>of a scale under rotation, and some more for the<br/>calculations page such as a hypermos scale generator,<br/>which would fit in with the other entries already in the tree)</p><p>I&apos;ll get round to them eventually, unless someone else does<br/>them first.</p><p>Prob. many have ideas.</p><p>Looking forward to Seth&apos;s entry!<br/>(I&apos;ve been keeping an eye out, and I don&apos;t think I&apos;ve<br/>missed it).</p><p>If you update the database, let me know as I have stopped<br/>checking it as nothing has been added for some time.</p><p>Later on, when FAQ tree program is completely ready, I think<br/>we need to have a system by which several people have the<br/>ftp password, and can update the FAQ tree, so that it<br/>can be done frequently. Maybe the same people could also<br/>take on the job of adding faq entries as they are uploaded<br/>to the files area, (or wherever)?</p><p>Robert</p></div><h3>jpehrson@rcn.com</h3><span>4/17/2001 8:24:17 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In tuning@y..., &quot;Paul H.
