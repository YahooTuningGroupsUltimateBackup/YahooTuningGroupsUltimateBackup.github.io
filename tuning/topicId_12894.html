Have there ever been electric instruments before<br/>&gt;Pentasystem that have been tuned in fifths? Why has there never been<br/>&gt;a cello tuned if fifths when all the other classical stringed<br/>&gt;instruments are? To see these electric instruments tuned in fifths check<br/>out<br/>&gt;<a href="http://www.pentasystem.com">www.pentasystem.com</a></p><p>I tried to break it to him as gently as possible that cellos &gt;are&lt; tuned in<br/>fifths, and perhaps he was thinking of basses, which are tuned in fourths.<br/>He replied:</p><p>&gt;Do you mean upright or electric bass? What about double bass? Have there<br/>&gt;ever been five string cellos/double bass? Why are guitars not also tuned in<br/>&gt;fifths?</p><p>In reply, I explained that double bass and upright bass refered to the same<br/>thing, and suggested he investigate the viola da gamba family for possible<br/>five string instuments. As to why guitars are not tuned in fifths, besides<br/>the accident of historical precedent, all I could suggest was that it was<br/>one of those mysteries that make life interesting. At that point I could not<br/>resist asking:</p><p>&gt;Really, bucko, you do realize that anyone with even the tiniest musical<br/>&gt;education can tell that everything you are saying on your website is pure<br/>&gt;bullshit?</p><p>Tonite I received this rather telling reply:</p><p>&gt;You still haven&apos;t mentioned any previous electric instruments tuned in<br/>&gt;fifths. Also, we have 16 patents and 32 trademarks issued so far so<br/>bullshit<br/>&gt;or no, the profits will roll in. Believe me they are already crawling at<br/>the<br/>&gt;door, the Japanese tour starts in November. See you there?</p><p>Notice he did not dispute my assesment of the quality of information on<br/>their site, only that to him it seemed to be no impediment to their business<br/>plans. However, due to a heavy toothbrushing schedule, I will probably not<br/>be able to meet with Mr. Calkin and the &quot;maestro&quot; during their upcomming<br/>tour, and discuss further their revolution in the making. Unless what he<br/>meant was if he would see me crawling at the door, which is even more<br/>unlikely. My knees are not as flexible as they used to be.</p><p>I totally forgot to mention to him my JI guitar, which I tune in fifths and<br/>fourths.  Nodoubt it would have only confused him further, and for no<br/>discernable purpose. Actually, I&apos;m glad I forgot, &apos;cause they would probably<br/>patent it and then sue me.</p><p>Dante<br/><a href="http://users.rcn.com/dante.interport/justguitar.html">http://users.rcn.com/dante.interport/justguitar.html</a></p></div><h3>Darren Burgess &#x3C;DBURGESS@ACCELERATION.NET&#x3E;</h3><span>9/17/2000 6:57:30 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>16 Patents?!?
