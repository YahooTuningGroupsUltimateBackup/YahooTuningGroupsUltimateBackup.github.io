That makes sense.  Also I notice, looking at Joe Monzo&apos;s book<br/>&gt; that Young includes ratios 9:7:4 even in his &quot;Dream House&quot; which uses<br/>&gt; so many huge primes...  So by the Schulter definition, since it DOES<br/>&gt; include some smaller intervals, it would also be just intonation...</p><p>So what&apos;s your question?</p><p>--<br/>* D a v i d         B e a r d s l e y<br/>* 49/32  R a d i o &quot;all microtonal, all the time&quot;<br/>* <a href="http://www.virtulink.com/immp/lookhere.htm">http://www.virtulink.com/immp/lookhere.htm</a></p></div>
