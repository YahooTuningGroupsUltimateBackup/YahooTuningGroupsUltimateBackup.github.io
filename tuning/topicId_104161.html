It&apos;s the Generalized<br/>Septimalizer!</p><p>This is an extraordinarily useful, non-12 way to think about the<br/>harmonic series. Furthermore, it&apos;s proven to also be the most stable<br/>non-12-based way I have so far to experience the harmonic series.<br/>Instead of hearing the 12-EDO &quot;formula&quot; to construct the harmonic<br/>series, I can hear this &quot;formula&quot; instead. Instead of remembering that<br/>there&apos;s a &quot;new type of minor third&quot; and a &quot;new type of major second&quot;<br/>(7/6 and 8/7 respectively), I simply remember that there&apos;s the New<br/>Generalized Septimalizer which gives me access to a bunch of hip new<br/>sounds. Easy.</p><p>Porcupine lends itself to other useful theorems: if I have 3/2, I just<br/>go down by the Magical Porcupine Interval and create 8:11:12,<br/>8:10:11:12, and 8:9:10:11:12, in that order. And then if I go up from<br/>1/1, I get this great maqamic sounding interval, and then a minor<br/>third, and then a fourth. That&apos;s a theorem of how the Magical<br/>Porcupine Interval works. And then if I take that, and I put 9/8 below<br/>it, I now have 8:9:10:11:12. Now I&apos;m building new theorems about how<br/>the Magic Porcupine Interval &quot;works&quot; based on the old ones as lemmata.</p><p>So now, when I hear the harmonic series, it&apos;s pretty clear to me what<br/>the underlying formula is. It&apos;s obviously made up of slight variations<br/>of magical porcupine intervals!</p><p>Any other useful &quot;theorems&quot; anyone&apos;s worked out? This stuff seems to<br/>be quite dramatically related to my categorical perception of<br/>intervals.</p><p>-Mike</p><p>PS: I note that non-musicians typically don&apos;t exhibit very strong<br/>categorical perception. Clearly a good dose of ear training would<br/>teach them that harmonic series is obviously made up of slight<br/>variations of magical porcupine intervals!</p></div><h3><a id=104163 href="#104163">ðŸ”—</a>genewardsmith &#x3C;genewardsmith@...&#x3E;</h3><span>3/22/2012 9:01:37 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, Mike Battaglia &lt;battaglia01@...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; In semaphore temperament, the following is true:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; - If I add 7/4 to 4:5:6, it becomes an otonal 7-limit chord.<br/>&gt; - If I add 7/4 to 10:12:15, it becomes a utonal 7-limit chord.</p><p>Why do I care about 10:12:14:15, and what makes it utonal?

That&apos;s an interesting problem<br/>&gt; because, unlike say with the 11-limit, the differences between 7 and 3 or 5<br/>&gt; limit intervals don&apos;t lend themselves to being perceived as step sizes;<br/>&gt; 36/35 and 49/48 for example are what we&apos;d usually consider commas rather<br/>&gt; than steps.</p><p>Most 12-EDO listeners people perceive 36/35 as a &quot;comma&quot; and 49/48 as<br/>a &quot;step.&quot; 36/35 switches between different types of the same thing,<br/>and 49/48 switches between a major second and a minor third, or a<br/>major sixth and a minor seventh, etc.</p><p>I suggest that there&apos;s an alternate way to do things other than the<br/>usual approach above: if one is in 24-EDO or 19-EDO, then 7/4 and 12/7<br/>are the same thing, and they both correspond to an interval &quot;of around<br/>950 cents.&quot; This magical interval turns 5-limit triads into 7-limit<br/>tetrads, regardless of the polarity of the original triad.</p><p>So an alternate way to conceive of the 7-limit is that there&apos;s this<br/>singular new interval to learn, which is in between things that you<br/>know, and that 12/7 and 7/4 are comma-shifted versions of that. Now<br/>49/48&apos;s the comma, and 36/35&apos;s the step. Now you&apos;re thinking of the<br/>7-limit in terms of &quot;quarter tones&quot; rather than thinking of the<br/>11-limit in terms of quarter tones.</p><p>&gt; I think it would be very difficult to get 12-tEt musicians not to hear the<br/>&gt; 7-limit in terms of known categories, and the 11 limit in terms of<br/>&gt; &quot;quartertones&quot;.</p><p>I don&apos;t think it&apos;s that difficult, after a grand total of a half a<br/>month with a 19-EDO guitar. Basically, just imagine you&apos;re not<br/>learning &quot;the 7-limit,&quot; but that you&apos;re instead making the jump from<br/>meantone to semaphore.</p><p>It&apos;s almost the entire point of semaphore, as it pertains to JI, to<br/>think of the 7-limit in the way that I said above - 8/7 and 7/6 become<br/>the same thing, and hence 7/4 and 12/7 become the same thing. Someone<br/>who&apos;s jumping from meantone to semaphore will quickly learn that<br/>there&apos;s this new interval which turns any 5-limit triad they know into<br/>the awesome 7-limit extended version of that triad. If someone&apos;s<br/>really internalizing semaphore temperament, then that will be the<br/>cognitive framework with which they understand harmony. Then when they<br/>want to move to JI, 7/4 and 12/7 will just be comma-shifted variants<br/>of the general-purpose septimalizer utility interval that they know so<br/>well.</p><p>I think I&apos;m going to start telling people that 7/4 is &quot;the interval<br/>that&apos;s about a quarter tone between a minor seventh and a major sixth&quot;<br/>from now on. I&apos;m going to cruelly and evilly split my musician friends<br/>into two groups and teach them totally differently, using my social<br/>status to convince each group separately that the way I&apos;m explaining<br/>it to them is &quot;the right way&quot; to think about microtonal music. Then<br/>I&apos;ll have them play music with one another and watch as nobody can<br/>understand what the other is doing. God, I&apos;m such a sadist.</p><p>&gt; And I think that the solution to getting these intervals to be heard on<br/>&gt; their own terms is obvious: they need categorical (scalar, functional)<br/>&gt; identities which are not dependent on specific precise tuning.</p><p>Yes, this is what I&apos;ve been trying to say. My whole point is, they can<br/>simply learn that &quot;7-limit stuff&quot; emerges from the -general category-<br/>of what Margo Schulter has called an &quot;interseptimal interval.&quot; Then<br/>7/4 and 12/7 emerge as comma-shifted variants of that.</p><p>I note also that it&apos;s not immediately intuitive for many people to<br/>think of 11/8 as a quarter tone between 500 and 600 cents or whatever.<br/>At first I thought of it as a flat #4, so like a flat version of 600<br/>cents, or something like that.
