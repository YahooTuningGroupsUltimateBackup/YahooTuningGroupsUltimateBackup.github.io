I was quite convinced that<br/>Johnny was on the right track.  So I find your theories fascinating.</p><p>I wanted to comment on one particular sentence in your post:</p><p>&gt;<br/>&gt; Baroque minds, JSB included, differ from ours, nowadays.<br/>&gt; Refer to Rolf Dammann, Der Musikbegriff im Deutschen Barock.</p><p>I just came across something regarding this on the internet,<br/>and I wish I could find it now.  It had to do with the use<br/>of well-temperaments during the late-Baroque and Classical<br/>periods.</p><p>The whole development of European music during this time<br/>was deeply rotted in the idea of modulation.  This is a very<br/>important consideration, in light of the fact that the preferred<br/>tunings (at least for keyboards) were well-temperaments, because<br/>each and every key would have its own distinct &quot;color&quot; or &quot;flavor&quot;.</p><p>I&apos;m much more knowledgeable about the Classical symphonic repertoire<br/>than about any other type or period of music which would fall<br/>under the broader umbrella which would also cover Bach&apos;s keyboard<br/>works.  So what follows is based more on Haydn / Mozart / Beethoven<br/>symphonies than on anything else, and digresses quite a bit from the<br/>topic of Bach&apos;s tuning.  But I feel that it&apos;s relevant anyway.</p><p>The evolution of sonata-form during the &quot;Enlightenment&quot; (the period<br/>covering Ha./Mo./Be.) had a *lot* to do with the idea that the<br/>listener would be &quot;traveling&quot; thru the different &quot;colors&quot; of the<br/>different keys.</p><p>The whole basis of sonata-form is the act of modulating into a<br/>new key for the second theme during the exposition, but twisting<br/>that modulation during the recapitulation so that the second<br/>theme returns at that point not in *its* original key, but in<br/>the key of the first theme.</p><p>This is an inherently dramatic situation, whose development [1]<br/>ultimately led to the styles/methods of Wagner and Schoenberg.<br/>The opening key is firmly established by the first theme, and<br/>the second theme is an intruder into a NEW SONIC TERRITORY,<br/>which a well-temperament would help to delineate.</p><p>This sets up a conflict in which various musical motives<br/>are combined and set against each other in an attempt at<br/>resolution: the &quot;development&quot; section.  At some point a<br/>resolution is achieved, the recapitulation brings the listener<br/>back &quot;to the top&quot;, and the formerly antagonistic second theme<br/>is this time presented comfortably in the movement&apos;s &quot;tonic&quot; key.</p><p>It&apos;s my opinion that the use of a well-temperament makes<br/>all of this *much* more audible.</p><p>As I discuss in my webpage on &quot;Mozart&apos;s Tuning: 55-EDO&quot;<br/>&lt;<a href="http://www.ixpres.com/interval/monzo/55edo/55edo.htm">http://www.ixpres.com/interval/monzo/55edo/55edo.htm</a>&gt;,<br/>Mozart&apos;s keyboards would have normally been tuned in a<br/>well-temperament, but otherwise (i.e., for singers and other<br/>instruments), &quot;correct tuning&quot; for him meant a subset of 55-EDO,<br/>or at least something which approximated 55-EDO and exhibited<br/>the characteristics normally found in meantones.</p><p>And as Chesnut states in the article I cite in my webpage,<br/>the &quot;new&quot; Pythagorean-based tuning paradigm came into vogue<br/>right around the time of Mozart&apos;s death, so Mozart may have<br/>been one of the last &quot;big&quot; composers to use a meantone basis<br/>for the tuning of his non-keyboard music.</p><p>It&apos;s also been my contention for a long time that Beethoven&apos;s<br/>harmonic usage stressed an equaling-out of pitch relationships,<br/>thus tending to prepare listeners for the acceptance of 12-EDO<br/>as a standard in symphonic music.  (12-EDO had already been<br/>generally accepted centuries before for fretted string instruments.)</p><p>But the point of all this rambling is that the well-temperament<br/>tuning of keyboards seems to have been the only constant regarding<br/>tuning during this period.  Thus, Ha./Mo./Be. (and their<br/>contemporaries) probably all had the key-colors of well-temperament<br/>in mind when they composed much of their music.  I have seen<br/>documentation that this was indeed the case for Beethoven.</p><p>-----------<br/>NOTE</p><p>[1]</p><p>Hmm... my choice of the word &quot;development&quot; here turned out to<br/>be a serendipitously nice pun... I was using this word here to refer<br/>to the historical evolution of sonata-form from its beginning,<br/>thru Haydn and Mozart, to some kind of culmination in Beethoven<br/>(who more than anyone else, I think, saw the possibilities and<br/>was able to realize them in sound), and beyond.</p><p>But the word also happens to refer, in English-language music-theory<br/>anyway (I know the German is different) to the &quot;development&quot; section<br/>of a sonata-form, which is the &quot;battle-ground&quot; where the drama is resolved.</p><p>It was Beethoven&apos;s genius in his _Eroica_ symphony to add two<br/>enhancements to this procedure: 1) to introduce *new* material<br/>in the &quot;development&quot; section, and 2) to introduce &quot;developmental&quot;<br/>qualities into the music of the recapitulation, so that final<br/>resolution is delayed until the coda, thus keeping the listener&apos;s<br/>attention up to the end.  This is an important consideration in<br/>a symphonic movement that is twice as long as any that had been<br/>written before it!</p><p>Haydn and Mozart tended to use the &quot;twisted&quot; pseudo-modulation<br/>in the recap as a means toward having some fun - a sort of benign<br/>allusion to the real conflict that ocurred the first time around<br/>in exposition.  After this the second theme would be recapitulated<br/>in the movement&apos;s &quot;tonic&quot; and all would be well.</p><p>But Beethoven really saw the dramatic possibilites of this moment<br/>in the structure, and realized that the resolution of the conflict<br/>could be delayed to a point farther along.  This allowed him to<br/>embellish the music of the alleged &quot;recapitulation&quot; with further<br/>variation, which in turn led to the further loosening of structure<br/>and tonality and greater expressivity of Wagner&apos;s music-dramas,<br/>then Mahler&apos;s symphonies, then Schoenberg&apos;s atonality and<br/>expressionism.</p><p>I realize that this is a simplistic &quot;this-begat-that&quot; scenario,<br/>and that the actual situation is really much more complicated.<br/>Please indulge me.</p><p>But this consideration of the further evolution of musical<br/>attitudes does relate to to your original point about the<br/>difference of the Baroque mind from ours today.</p><p>-monz<br/><a href="http://www.monz.org">http://www.monz.org</a><br/>&quot;All roads lead to n^0&quot;</p><p>_________________________________________________________<br/>Do You Yahoo!?<br/>Get your free <a href="https://twitter.com/yahoo">@yahoo</a>.com address at <a href="http://mail.yahoo.com">http://mail.yahoo.com</a></p></div>
