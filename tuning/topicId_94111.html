My experiences through the<br/>American Festival of Microtonal Music have been a different path.</p><p>When I first explored tuning on the bassoon, I could use a Korg tuner that<br/>would literally &quot;sing out&quot; pitches that I calculated by a knob on the<br/>machine.  Since that time (late &apos;70s), that Korg machine was  discontinued.<br/>Later Korg models did not &quot;sing&quot; out pitches, which is  terribly unfortunate<br/>for the up and coming musicians (especially woodwind  players, who need to<br/>document there fingerings for each specific pitch in each  octave).  Yes, there<br/>are other possible methods to learn pitches in other  tuning system, but<br/>NYC musicians were visibly beholden to the Korg  tuner.  The principle oboist<br/>of the NY Philharmonic, Joe Robinson,  regularly tuned the orchestra up with<br/>this very same Korg tuner (model  WT-12).</p><p>Now, in a new era, many different tunings have internalized in my  mind and<br/>on the bassoon.  There is really no interval that cannot be  achieved with<br/>certainty on the instrument.  Of course, this has always been  true on<br/>fretless strings, but it is also true on woodwinds, and  brass.</p><p>So, I&apos;m now playing a 32-tone scale that stems from the 6th octave of the<br/>harmonic series.  Without any outside help, I can now adjudicate any<br/>interval, and have now begun exercises to gain great fluidity in the  playing.  I<br/>am sounding &quot;fresh&quot; again, exploring new terrain, traipsing on  new worlds.</p><p>My sense is that these pitches are part of a harmony that are audio<br/>pressure points on the sensitive human being receptor.  New piece is  coming<br/>together as a result.</p><p>AND most important, this is no gimmick in making the bassoon SOUND more<br/>beautiful in its richness.  The ideas I want to express below were first<br/>written down by me 35 years ago.  Originally, more of an intuition, time  only<br/>anchored these ideas for a raison-d&apos;etre for working so hard to accomplish<br/>microtonal music on the bassoon:</p><p>1.  New fingerings make for virtuosic technique.  Better than  etudes,<br/>working between different fingerings permits (through the complex dance  of<br/>fingering combinations) any music in conventional tuning to be  recognizeably<br/>easy to play.</p><p>2.  Tone richness blooms!  Learning myriads of timbral  possibility<br/>transforms the entire instrument.  Dark to bright range  increases are added to<br/>whole new dimensions of timbre colorings.   There are differences in attack,<br/>differences in dynamic, differences in  otherworldliness.  The whole<br/>instrument is on a higher plane relating to  tone color ability.</p><p>3.  Pitch acuity on levels previously unimaginable result.  Now  that I&apos;ve<br/>been adding tuning upon tuning to my repertoire, I compose<br/>polymicrotonally.  And I can serve as the &quot;tuner&quot; (however  non-electronic) for the other<br/>musicians.</p><p>And of course, all I said about the bassoon is by extension true for  every<br/>other instrument (within degrees).</p><p>Johnny Reinhard</p></div>
