That way you can slide any pattern along the chain and it gives the same chord (or subset scale) everywhere that it fits. No wolves. You&apos;ll just have to change the notation to match your favourite Blackjack key (the above mostly use degree numbers for 72-tET). And of course they must be viewed in a monospaced font such as Courier.</p><p>I give below, a Blackjack chain of secors using the notation that I treat as standard, because it&apos;s center (D) matches a center of the Halberstadt keyboard and the center of the meantone universe that all our notation is based on (D is the central note in the chain of natural fifths FCGDAEB). Note that miracle and meantone meet in 31-tET. This key has the same number of sharps as flats. It also happens to suit my Blackjack guitar design, and I think it suits Graham Breed&apos;s guitar tuning too.</p><p>Note that this key has an A natural in it, which should be tuned to 440 Hz and everything else based on that. The fact that A isn&apos;t the center of the chain is irrelevant.</p><p> D&gt; E[ F&lt;F#v G Ab^ A&gt; B[ C&lt;C#v D Eb^ E&gt; F] G&lt;G#v A Bb^ B&gt; C] D&lt;</p><p>Legend for 72-tET notation:</p><p>ABCDEFG#b as in 12-tET<br/>plus the ASCIIfied Sims accidentals<br/>] = 1/4  tone up<br/>&gt; = 1/6  tone up<br/>^ = 1/12 tone up<br/>v = 1/12 tone down<br/>&lt; = 1/6  tone down<br/>[ = 1/4  tone down</p><p>Here&apos;s the key Joseph Pehrson uses, centered on C.</p><p> C&gt; D[Eb&lt; Ev F Gb^ G&gt; A[Bb&lt; Bv C Db^ D&gt; E[ F&lt;F#v G Ab^ A&gt; B[ C&lt;</p><p>That&apos;s the one Paul Erlich&apos;s 3D 7-limit lattices are based on, since he made them for Joseph, except he uses Gbv where it should be F#v.

It&apos;s centered on the D:A fifth (like Eb to G# in meantone). It contains GDAE naturals. It has a JI major scale with no second, on A, and a JI minor scale with no fourth, on G.

You could center it on G:D and get both C and A naturals. But why any particular natural has to be there, I&apos;m not sure. Whatever naturals you have you would tune the same as they are in a 12-tET based on A440.</p><p>And finally here&apos;s Graham Breed&apos;s decimal notation.</p><p> 4&gt; 5&gt; 6&gt; 7&gt; 8&gt; 9&gt; 0  1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9  0&lt; 1&lt; 2&lt; 3&lt; 4&lt;</p><p>The whole point of the decimal notation is that you can then throw away the slide rule. All you have to remember is that 0&lt; comes after 9 and 9&gt; comes before 0. Then you can transpose chords and scales by simple addition and subtraction.</p><p>But in the meantime, choose the sliders for the scales or chords of interest, from the archived posts whose URLs are given above, and paste them above or below a Blackjack chain of secors as notated above.
