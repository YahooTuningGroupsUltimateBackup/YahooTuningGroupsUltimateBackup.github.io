I<br/>would say within the last 6 months, BOTH the Easley Blackwood book on<br/>the STRUCTURE OF RECOGNIZABLE DIATONIC TUNINGS and the big Owen<br/>Jorgensen TUNING have gone out of print...</p><p>This is a shame, since I was hoping to add BOTH eventually to my<br/>library... I guess we can try again the used outlets... but this is<br/>getting exasperating, after the Barbour out, etc.</p><p>Fortunately Partch&apos;s GENESIS and the Helmholtz SENSATION are still<br/>around... but I guess they make &quot;great classics&quot; status now...</p><p>____________ _____ ____ ___ _ _<br/>Joseph Pehrson</p></div>
