Just a cursory glance at Japanese shakuhachi music reveals that the<br/>pentatonic is much more complex than 5 fixed pitches.  The musics&apos;<br/>expressiveness lies in the many variations of each degree.</p><p>A 72t-ET analysis of &quot;Kyo No Yoru&quot; (&quot;The Art of the Japanese Bamboo Flute&quot; CD<br/>306; Legacy International) shows a basic pentatonic scale of Bb(-17&#xFFFD;);<br/>Cb(-17&#xFFFD;); Eb; F; Gb(-17&#xFFFD;).  However Gb appears at concert pitch; (-67&#xFFFD;); (-50&#xFFFD;)<br/>and (+17&#xFFFD;); the F at (-17&#xFFFD;) and (+17&#xFFFD;); the Eb glides up to +17&#xFFFD; and later to<br/>+50&#xFFFD;; appears at -17&#xFFFD; and +33&#xFFFD;; the Cb (+17&#xFFFD;); (-50&#xFFFD;); (-33&#xFFFD;); and even the<br/>home pitch Bb appears at (+17&#xFFFD;) and at concert pitch.  At the end a sixth pitch<br/>is added, the lowered leading tone or Ab (-17&#xFFFD;).</p><p>Can Akkoc wrote:</p><p>&lt;snip&gt;</p><p>&gt; Dear Mr. Annis,<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; In my humble judgement, per my research based on direct measurements made<br/>&gt; on performances by master musicians, the so called &apos;scales&apos; in Turkish music<br/>&gt; are NOT deterministic/fixed sequences, as in western music. Instead, they<br/>&gt; are distributions or &apos;smears&apos; along the pitch axis, where a certain &apos;note&apos;<br/>&gt; on the scale associated with the underlying maqam may present itself in a<br/>&gt; multitude of pitches depending upon where the music is &apos;coming from&apos; within<br/>&gt; the past few sounds. Therefore, I do not believe a fixed tuning, no matter<br/>&gt; how intricate, is the answer for Turkish music and possibly other musics.<br/>&gt; The concept of &apos;tuning&apos; has to be viewed in a revolutionary manner with a<br/>&gt; fluid  and dynamic structure.<br/>&gt; Dr. Can Akkoc<br/>&gt; Alabama School of Mathematics and Science<br/>&gt; 1255 Dauphin Street<br/>&gt; Mobile, AL 36604<br/>&gt; USA</p></div>
