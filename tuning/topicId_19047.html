I<br/>&gt; &gt; have to pose a few question and some observations.</p><p>&gt; &gt; First are there any  recordings of unaccompanied choral music<br/>&gt; &gt; in meantone.</p><p>There is one recording which comes close to a &quot;Flexible Just Intonation&quot;<br/>(s. below)</p><p>Gesualdo: Quinto libro dei madrigali<br/>The Concsort of Musicke (S: Emma Kirkby and Evelyn Tubb, A: Mary<br/>Nichols, T: Joseph Cornwell and Andrew King, B: Richard Wistreich).<br/>Anthony Rooley [What he did in this recording is not mentioned]<br/>P 1983<br/>released 1991 as CD<br/>Decca: L&apos;oiseau-lyre 410128-2</p><p>It is probably out of stock, nowadays</p><p>Unfortunately some of the nice effects are blurred sometimes by vibrato<br/>of the tenors.</p><p>&gt; &gt; Like is it even possible.</p><p>Probably not - or have you ever heard a singer who is able to produce<br/>constantly a quarter-comma flat fifth etc.<br/>I wrote about this in the harpsichord-list:<br/><a href="http://listserv.albany.edu:8080/cgi-bin/wa?A2=ind0009&L=hpschd-l&P=R23631">http://listserv.albany.edu:8080/cgi-bin/wa?A2=ind0009&L=hpschd-l&P=R23631</a></p><p>&gt; I reiterate -- the distinction between meantone and, say,<br/>&gt; Vicentino&apos;s adaptive JI system is too small to be meaningful<br/>&gt; when applied to a capella vocal music -- both represent an<br/>&gt; idealized point around which &quot;authentic&quot; Renaissance practice<br/>&gt; will deviate more or less. What we can say with some<br/>&gt; confidence is that neither 12-tET nor strict JI renditions would be<br/>&gt; acceptable for this music.<br/>....<br/>&gt; of ratios than 12-tET. But yes, small vocal intonational inflections<br/>&gt; for emotional purposes may have been part of the style, for all<br/>&gt; we know.</p><p>&gt; &gt; I believe the concept of adaptive JI and extended reference</p><p>&gt; Well it&apos;s quite another thing for us denizens of the 21st century, in<br/>&gt; our little corner of tuning experimentation, to imaginatively try<br/>&gt; things out in one tuning or another. However, even today, the vast<br/>&gt; majority of trained singers are singing essentially in 12-tET,</p><p>I don&apos;t believe that - most of have not any good idea about intonation,<br/>because even their teachers don&apos;t know what a pure major third is (not<br/>to speak of minor and major semitones)</p><p>&gt; &quot;high third&quot;) as &quot;normal&quot;. Similarly, singers in Gesualdo&apos;s day<br/>&gt; may have been trained using meantone-tuned keyboards . . .</p><p>I&apos;d think so too. referring to my article in the hspchd-list I&apos;d say<br/>that they used the good thirds in meantone as a reference. But in the<br/>moment that you are playing or singing your note it is too late. You<br/>must know before what the next chord is going to be and &quot;where&quot; your<br/>pitch is expected, to be as pure as possible above the lowest sounding note.<br/>Temperaments of instruments with fixed pitches have little or nothing to<br/>do with the intonation of singers or the other instruments.</p><p>&gt; any documentation on this?</p><p>I doubt that there is any description of how to rehearse, to practice<br/>this aspect of music, from that time, but also not from much later<br/>times. I&apos;d be delighted to be confirmed about the opposite.<br/>But in teaching works up to the late 18th century Agricola/Tosi, Quantz,<br/>Leopold Mozart, T&iuml;&iquest;&half;rk etc. you find descriptions that the singers should<br/>know and make the correct distinction in singing f. ex. a g-sharp resp.<br/>a-flat. Nowhere any hint to keyboard temperaments - because how would a<br/>singer opr violinist in a well-tempered-tuning (of the<br/>continuo-instrument) hit the right c# in an A-major-chord and a few<br/>secons later a somewhat higher major third d# in B-major?</p><p>I compare this to the organ where we find Mixture-stops with pure fifths<br/>and sometimes major thirds, which are tuned pure to the resp. note<br/>played on the keyboard, whichs temperament contrastc more or less. The<br/>organ reflects the vocal instrumental ensemble practice in that respect too.</p><p>kind regards<br/>Ibo Ortgies</p><p>&quot;If everything else fails, practice!&quot;<br/>Inscription on a pencil, found mid of the 1980&apos;s at the<br/>music desk of the mid-17th-century organ in Uttum</p><p>------------------------<br/>Ibo Ortgies</p><p><a href="http://www.hum.gu.se/goart/ortgies/homepage.htm">http://www.hum.gu.se/goart/ortgies/homepage.htm</a><br/><a href="http://www.hum.gu.se/goart/ortgies/public.html">http://www.hum.gu.se/goart/ortgies/public.html</a></p><p>GOArt (G&iuml;&iquest;&half;teborg Organ Art center) G&iuml;&iquest;&half;teborgs universitet<br/><a href="http://www.hum.gu.se/goart/w-1.htm">http://www.hum.gu.se/goart/w-1.htm</a><br/>----------------------------------<br/><a href="http://www.schnitgerorgel.de/html/enginzenso.html">http://www.schnitgerorgel.de/html/enginzenso.html</a><br/>Support  INZENSO<br/>Initiative for the Preservation of the Neuenfelde Schnitger Organ<br/>The historical center of Neuenfelde and the church are threatened by the<br/>expansion of the Hamburg Airbus factory!</p></div><h3>Paul H.
