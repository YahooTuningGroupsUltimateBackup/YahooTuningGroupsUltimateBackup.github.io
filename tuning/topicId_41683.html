(I wish some choir would record Isaac&apos;s Choralis Constantinus, it&apos;s a fascinating collection and provides a lot of insight to Webern&apos;s compositional tendencies.) Bartok went to school for composition and piano, and became a folk music collector later for largely compositional reasons. I got my degrees in composition and then became a music historian partly to redress my own grievances about American music, partly because the academic musicology community had become a lot hipper than the compositional community, and it was the only way a rabble-rouser like me could get a job. To this day I can get interviewed for music history positions, *never* for composition jobs.</p><p>Not that degrees mean anything, as has been intermittently pointed out here lately. I&apos;m glad I got a doctorate in music: it allowed me to pick up a tremendous amount of useless information whose significance I will now never be tempted to overrate. And of course, in all those years nothing was ever mentioned about tuning at all except for a couple of days on the harmonic series and meantone temperament during the first two weeks of my freshman year at Oberlin, which is still more than most undergrads ever get. I didn&apos;t *really* learn harmony until I studied privately with Ben Johnston *after* grad school. I&apos;d like to think that because I went to grad school, hundreds of other musicians with better things to do won&apos;t have to.</p><p>(I have to slightly qualify this bit of cynicism: at Northwestern I took a mind-blowing course on the late Beethoven sonatas with composer Peter Gena. Of course, when they realized how brilliant he was, they denied him tenure.)</p><p>&gt;Hello Kyle!</p><p>&gt;Once again like myself but more toward<br/>&gt;ethnomusicology. i have thought that<br/>&gt;this is a natural balence to being a composer.<br/>&gt;To balence the &quot;creation of the new&quot; with the<br/>&gt;&quot;preservation of the old&quot;.<br/>&gt;next i&apos;ll find out you are left handed</p><p>Nope, right-handed. Kraig, I wouldn&apos;t create any more basis for confusing you and me than already exists. You can only hurt your reputation. :^)</p><p>Cheers,</p><p>Kyle</p></div><h3><a id=41684 href="#41684">ðŸ”—</a>Gene Ward Smith &#x3C;genewardsmith@juno.com&#x3E; &#x3C;genewardsmith@juno.com&#x3E;</h3><span>12/27/2002 7:17:53 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, Kyle Gann &lt;kgann@e...&gt; wrote:</p><p>&gt; Not that degrees mean anything, as has been intermittently pointed<br/>&gt; out here lately.

Of<br/>course, that was a particular location, and probably the number of<br/>such composing communities is quite limited.</p><p>Continued Happy Holidays from Michigan!</p><p>Joseph Pehrson</p></div>
