Not one of the works on the May 20th program featured the typical mad dash<br/>scurrying about that characterizes much of the solo instrument literature in the<br/>12-tone tradition. I heard some wonderfully inspiring solo work that was completely<br/>free of the Paganini / Liszt influence. The works I heard were heart centered<br/>rather than solar-plexus centered in chakra terms. They were not about the<br/>performer as athletic competitor trying to outdo the other or prove  to himself or<br/>the listener that he can conquer the instrument. These were about the love of<br/>sound, breath, time and subtlety.<br/> Ko-Lho by Giacinto Scelsi opened the program. Scelsi exercises the most<br/>extraordinary restraint as he confines pitch between flute and clarinet until a<br/>center from which to microtonaly depart takes hold. Once the ear is centered (and<br/>not simply centered on a drone) then the most subtle departures can unfold without<br/>any interval sounding awkward. The performers were Michiyo Suzuki on clarinet and<br/>Andrew Bolotowsky on flute.<br/> Theodasii Spassov&#xFFFD;s work on the Kaval was nothing short of pure genius as this<br/>brilliant young virtuoso expressed his whole world of influences through a<br/>shepherd&#xFFFD;s pipe, coaxing from it the purest flute tones at one moment to sounds<br/>full of raw breathy guttural power. My mind reeled as I heard coming from this<br/>clarinet sized keyless instrument full bodied tones in the lower bassoon register.<br/>I loved the way he built toward the episodes that sounded distinctly Bulgarian in<br/>rhythm and nuanced pitch.<br/> Johnny Reinhard&#xFFFD;s new work Sleep unfolded masterfully with such a gentle sense of<br/>wide open pitch and time space. His fondness for choreographing the performer<br/>integral to the piece looked ever so graceful to watch as clarinetist Michiyo<br/>Suzuki effortlessly bent, kneeled and even stretched out  on a pillow, all the time<br/>playing her instrument.  She&#xFFFD;s one of the few musicians who&#xFFFD;s control over<br/>multiphonics is such that the multiphonic no longer raises the flag &quot;extended<br/>technique&quot;.  She can really execute multiple tones that grow right out of the<br/>phrase as if the clarinet were originally intended to do such impossibilities. Of<br/>course Johnny may well have been responsible for such elegance in his writing<br/>although I suspect there was a lot of good collaborating as well.<br/>     I enjoyed hearing Dowland played by Wim Hoogewerf in what was described as<br/>Dowland&#xFFFD;s favorite tuning but I had no way to compare the effect to that of<br/>standard guitar tuning. The performance was mature and commanding. Later in the<br/>program Wim returned to perform on the quarter-tone guitar works of Carillo written<br/>in 1931.  Carillos&#xFFFD;s penchant for obvious sequences sounded raw and primitive in<br/>the light of recent conceptions but it was a treat to place microtonality in<br/>historical context.<br/>     Philip Corner&#xFFFD;s Two Microtonal Memories for trombone and theramin was<br/>masterfully played by Peter Zummo with Johnny on the theramin. The theramin was<br/>very intriguing to watch since there is no instrument that I can think of that one<br/>plays without physical contact since gesture becomes sound directly. I naturally<br/>trust in Johnny&#xFFFD;s ear to make things sound right.<br/>     As for the concluding work, Thirsting for Peace in a Raging Century by Edward<br/>Sanders  the synthesized sounds quality of the 31 tone microlyre was dull and dated<br/>as was the two singers harmonizing in 3rds and 6ths. The acoustics of the chapel in<br/>its abundant reverberation suited everything else on the program except  this<br/>strange folk-like work that seemed to go on endlessly, spinning out its twelve<br/>verses which I had difficult understanding. The returning refrain &quot;thirsting for<br/>Peace&#xFFFD;&quot; helped me to keep count.<br/> Overall it was a great and inspiring evening.</p><p>Howard Rovics<br/><a href="mailto:rovics@ct2.nai.net">rovics@ct2.nai.net</a></p></div><h3>David Beardsley &#x3C;xouoxno@xxxx.xxxx&#x3E;</h3><span>5/25/1999 5:42:23 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Howard Rovics wrote:</p><p>&gt;  Ko-Lho by Giacinto Scelsi opened the program.

It just a tube,the mouthpiece: an<br/>end bown hole. One minute he&apos;s playing a flute,<br/>then he produces a didgeridu-like buzz with his lips that access a much lower range<br/>of notes. He played solo but also performed a stunning duet with Johnny Reinhard.<br/>Amazing.</p><p>&gt;  Johnny Reinhard&#xFFFD;s new work Sleep unfolded masterfully with such a gentle sense of<br/>&gt; wide open pitch and time space.
