This<br/>temperament goes to Ludicrous Speed in terms of accuracy, which is<br/>why I hadn&apos;t checked it until now. The amazing thing is, it&apos;s quite<br/>practical! I thought it might be after considering what we get for a<br/>septimal version of the kleismic temperament of minor thirds.</p><p>The generators are closely approximated by 6/5 and 10/9, and in fact<br/>we can take these to be the genrators. In terms of the 612 (shismic)<br/>division, we have one generator of &quot;a&quot; size 161.0087757 shismas and<br/>another &quot;b&quot; of 92.96822599 shismas. We then have</p><p>3 ~ 2^2 * a^(-1) * b^(-1), 0.0000424 cents sharp<br/>5 ~ 2^3 * a^(-2) * b^(-1), -9.42 x 10^(-6) cents flat<br/>7 ~ 2^3 * a * b^(-3), 4.711 x 10^(-5) cents sharp</p><p>If we use instead 6/5 for a and 10/9 for b, we have the 5-limit in<br/>perfect tune, with a pentatonic generator system. The 7 is flat by<br/>exactly 4374/4375. All of this should pass inspection even by Harry<br/>Partch.</p></div><h3>Jon Szanto &#x3C;JSZANTO@ADNC.COM&#x3E;</h3><span>11/24/2001 2:45:02 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In tuning@y..., genewardsmith@j... wrote:<br/>&gt; In Spaceballs...</p><p>...etc...</p><p>&gt; All of this should pass inspection even by Harry Partch.</p><p>Engineer Gene, would you please stop referencing Mr. Partch to cloth<br/>yourself in semi-grandeur, or as some humorous tag line?
