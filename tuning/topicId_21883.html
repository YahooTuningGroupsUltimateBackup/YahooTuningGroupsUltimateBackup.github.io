Each task<br/>handled one of the Commodores music voices interpreting an<br/>independent text encoded part. [Actually it had a compile<br/>phase where some of the text data, for instance floating point<br/>numbers, was converted into whatever the pitch data was represented<br/>as]. I did a some JI and polyrythm experiments on that with accuracy<br/>I believe to be better than I can do now in MIDI. One neat trick<br/>I remember was writing a trill which I sped up until the &apos;note-on&apos;<br/>messages were well within the audio band (a few hundred hertz). It<br/>sounded like a two stroke motorcycle taking off. I believe the<br/>terminal pitch in this experiment was higher than I could acheive<br/>in MIDI as well.</p><p>Bob Valentine</p></div><h3>paul@stretch-music.com</h3><span>4/30/2001 9:23:44 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In tuning@y..., Robert C Valentine &lt;BVAL@I...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Paul said to Joseph :<br/>[...]<br/>&gt; &gt; (maximally even 19 out of 72)<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; ...and perfectly transposable.</p><p>Yes, maximally even or even just distributionally even scales<br/>are &quot;transposable&quot; in your sense.</p><p>So Dave Keenan&apos;s amazing 31 out of 72 is too (did you catch that one)?</p><p>&gt;<br/>&gt; Regarding C64&apos;s, the best music software I wrote was on that beast.</p><p>What did they call the sound chip on that?
