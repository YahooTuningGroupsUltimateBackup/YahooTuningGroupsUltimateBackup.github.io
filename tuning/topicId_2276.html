I don&apos;t<br/>have the references available to put these two<br/>contradictory statements in their proper chronological<br/>order, but the bit I quoted from Euler stating that<br/>music&apos;s basis had become by his time 2/3/5/7 was<br/>written in 1764, 5 years after the letter to Lagrange.</p><p>-monzo<br/><a href="http://www.ixpres.com/interval/monzo/homepage.html">http://www.ixpres.com/interval/monzo/homepage.html</a></p><p>-----------------</p><p>___________________________________________________________________<br/>You don&apos;t need to buy Internet access to use free Internet e-mail.<br/>Get completely free e-mail from Juno at <a href="http://www.juno.com/getjuno.html">http://www.juno.com/getjuno.html</a><br/>or call Juno at (800) 654-JUNO [654-5866]</p></div><h3>monz@xxxx.xxx</h3><span>4/12/1999 4:07:39 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>I wrote:</p><p>&gt; Perhaps this is just an indication that he changed<br/>&gt; his mind over the course of his research.</p><p>Ahh...
