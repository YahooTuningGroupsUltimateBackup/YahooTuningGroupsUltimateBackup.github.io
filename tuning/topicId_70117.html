Do you mean the comma names in<br/>relation to notating JI? Yes. The reader needs to know that if you<br/>want to know how to notate some ratio, you remove any factors of 2 or<br/>3 from it and go looking for the 2,3-reduced ratio in the name of the<br/>comma. Alternatively, you go looking for the exponents you want for<br/>the primes above 3 in the appropriate columns to the right.</p><p>You supply the necessary 3&apos;s by choosing the right Pythagorean nominal<br/>and sharps or flats to go with it.

The convergents to this are 1, 4/3, 5/4,<br/>14/11, 19/15 ... . We start out with (64/63)/(81/80) = 5120/5103.<br/>Hence level one, we might say, is tempering this out. Level two is<br/>the comma (81/80)/(5120/5103)^3 = (64/63)/(5120/5103)^4 = |-34 22 -4<br/>3&gt;. This is tempered out by a number of equal temperaments, but most<br/>notably 171-et.  171 also equates 225/224 with 5120/5103, which<br/>allows us to discuss it in terms of that instead. The third level<br/>would be to use (5120/5103)^4/(81/80) = (5120/5103)^5/(64/63) = |44 -<br/>28 5 -4&gt;. Again, a number of equal temperaments temper this out, but<br/>the standout is 441-et. Hence to simplify these sorts of notational<br/>systems in the 7-limit, fitting them to 171 or 441 seems like the way<br/>to go. Note that in 441, 64/63 is ten steps, 81/80 is eight steps,<br/>and the fundamental unit 5120/5103 is two steps, not one step.</p><p>For the 11-limit, we want 33/32 in the picture, and can&apos;t simply use<br/>the convergents of a continued fraction, but we could analyze it<br/>similarly. However, we might note to start out with that (64/63)^2/<br/>(33/32) = 131072/130977, and tempering this out can make for a<br/>logical simplification of the notation scheme. Both 224 and 441<br/>extend to this; but really, simply seeing what one gets with a good<br/>et probably now makes the most sense.</p></div><h3>Carl Lumma &#x3C;clumma@yahoo.com&#x3E;</h3><span>3/5/2007 12:14:47 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;Gene Ward Smith&quot; &lt;genewardsmith@...&gt;<br/>wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; --- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;Carl Lumma&quot; &lt;clumma@&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; I&apos;ll go on record saying I like HEWM notation.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I think it&apos;s pretty good too.</p><p>It&apos;s what I always thought Johnston notation was, until<br/>Dave told me that it&apos;s instead based on the 5-limit diatonic<br/>scale in JI.

Either will work.</p><p>Hi, Gene!  I&apos;ve been off-list all weekend and have returned to<br/>discover that this has become quite a lively discussion.</p><p>First off, let me apologize for a couple of things:</p><p>1) Inadequate documentation -- There have been so many issues to<br/>resolve lately (and very limited time to do so) that Dave &amp; I have<br/>not been able to give that much priority.</p><p>2) Short-sightedness -- When Dave &amp; I first started collaborating on<br/>Sagittal, we expected that we would be finishing up within 6 months,<br/>or a year at most.  We&apos;ve just begun our 6th year and are still in<br/>the thick of it.  There doesn&apos;t seem to be any end to new and/or<br/>unexpected issues coming up to challenge our way of thinking, so<br/>we&apos;ve constantly had to expand our horizons to keep up with new<br/>developments taking off in different directions.</p><p>A couple of days away from the discussion have given me a little time<br/>to reflect on what you&apos;ve been saying, and I now have a better<br/>perspective.</p><p>Our initial approach to Sagittal was to devise a way to notate<br/>microtonal pitches &amp; intervals for a broad range of tunings using a<br/>single superset of accidentals.  We expected that each tuning would<br/>need to be notated in *only one way*.  When the issue of additional<br/>ways of notating tunings (via non-standard nominals and staff<br/>configurations) came up, we then expected that the Sagittal<br/>accidentals could be used with those, and that approach does in fact<br/>seem to work quite well in the particular instances I&apos;ve looked at.<br/>Certainly, it makes it much less difficult for one to cope with new<br/>staff configurations if one is already familiar with the accidentals.</p><p>Taking the nominals in a chain of 5ths *other than the best 5ths*<br/>will then be treated not as an aberration, but simply as a case of<br/>non-standard nominals (except that they&apos;re &quot;non-standard&quot; only with<br/>respect to usual Sagittal practice), to which the accidentals may be<br/>applied in the same manner as with any other non-standard<br/>configuration.</p><p>The proper agenda, then, is not to debate whether the notation of 171<br/>is better served by a chain of best 5ths or meantone 5ths, but rather<br/>to leave that choice up to the user and, whatever the case, to<br/>specify the set of accidentals most appropriate to that tuning.</p><p>&gt; It should be noted that with 19 notes of Cb-E#, or 21 notes of Fb-<br/>B#,<br/>&gt; we would need in addition six symbol pairs rather than four.

The last certainly has small size working for it. If we<br/>decide that 4375/4374 is to be equated to the landscape comma and<br/>that five of them equal a schisma, a number of simplifications come<br/>into play. We have that two of the basic unit gives 2401/2400, three<br/>420175/419904, four 703125/702464, five a schisma, and six<br/>65625/65536. The temperament in question, the 171&amp;3125 temperament,<br/>is one I&apos;ve not listed because of its high complexity, but since I am<br/>now discussing it in terms of notation, I&apos;ve dubbed it &quot;ragimetric&quot;<br/>and listed it. Since my list is logflat badness ordered, it now shows<br/>up second after ennealimmal. Since 4375/4374 is one step of 3125-et,<br/>we can extend the system painlessly as 3125-et, whereupon 225/224 is<br/>20 ragismas, and so forth.

They both have<br/>the property that landscape is tempered out and 2401/2400 equates to<br/>4375/4374.

If you told me the lot of them were as visually different<br/>&gt; as possible (given that one also has to quickly distinguish<br/>&gt; that they fall into two classes: up and down), I would believe<br/>&gt; you.  But it seems that when using a subset (like the HEWM<br/>&gt; subset) we could do better.  Tartini/Couper seems to be one<br/>&gt; example.</p><p>Hi Carl,</p><p>You&apos;re absolutely right. You can always make any given subset<br/>internally more distinct. But the only way to have all (or even only<br/>the most popular) subsets as internally distinct as possible is to<br/>make them incompatible with each other or to make them less logical in<br/>some way. In a consistent system designed to cover all tunings there<br/>are an enormous number of tradeoffs to be considered. Everyone<br/>naturally tends to think that their application is the most important.</p><p>One of the features of Sagittal, that makes the notation of complex<br/>tunings more manageable, is what we call &quot;flag arithmetic&quot;. A flag is<br/>a half-arrowhead, of which there are 4 shapes and 2 sides on which to<br/>put them. If you see a symbol that _looks_ like it is composed from<br/>two other symbols then you can rest assured that it corresponds to the<br/>sum of their pitch alterations (or very nearly so).</p><p>You may remember that the Sagittal symbols were thrashed out on this<br/>list and the tuning-math list for over a year. Many people had input<br/>into them. It really was the best we could collectively come up with<br/>in a consistent system, and so I&apos;m glad you find that believable.</p><p>However<br/>-------</p><p>As Ralph Waldo Emerson famously said, &quot;A foolish consistency is the<br/>hobgoblin of little minds&quot;.</p><p>You are right that the universal logic of the system means that<br/>simpler tunings have paid a price in symbol distinctness, and they<br/>really shouldn&apos;t have to.</p><p>And they _don&apos;t_ have to! :)</p><p>We long ago provided the Wilson/Wolf sloping + and - symbols as<br/>alternative symbols for the 5-comma. Joseph Pehrson uses them along<br/>with the remaining Sagittal symbols for 72-EDO. You can see them in<br/>the bottom row of figure 12 on page 20 of the Sagittal XH18 article.<br/><a href="http://users.bigpond.net.au/d.keenan/sagittal/sagittal.pdf">http://users.bigpond.net.au/d.keenan/sagittal/sagittal.pdf</a></p><p>And now, in Sagittal-2, we have provided the very symbols you mention.<br/>The Tartini/Couper symbols. You will see them at the start and end of<br/>the character map.<br/><a href="http://users.bigpond.net.au/d.keenan/sagittal/Sagittal2_Character_Map.pdf">http://users.bigpond.net.au/d.keenan/sagittal/Sagittal2_Character_Map.pdf</a><br/>(Don&apos;t forget you can right-click to zoom).</p><p>Please feel free to substitute the Tartini-Couper symbols for the<br/>Sagittal full arrows /|\  and \!/ or whichever Sagittal symbol<br/>corresponds to a half-apotome in the tuning being notated. So for<br/>example you can have a 72-EDO or HEWM-like notation that uses the<br/>Sagittal symbols only for the 7-comma, Wilson symbols for the 5-comma<br/>and Tartini-Couper (which Erv also used) for the 11-diesis.</p><p>I have designed the outlines of these symbol&apos;s so they are all<br/>compatible in visual style.</p><p>&gt; 2.

What&apos;s more, we agree<br/>with you that the tails of flats are too tall and so sagittals have<br/>slightly shorter tails. Sagittal tails are the same length as those of<br/>a conventional natural. Sagittals are designed so that you don&apos;t need<br/>to stagger them when notating a chord containing thirds as you are<br/>forced to do with conventionals and Tartini/Coupers.</p><p>As with the conventional flat, it is the center of gravity of the head<br/>of a sagittal that indicates the line or space to which it applies.<br/>George and I carefully examined all 232 symbols at very low resolution<br/>on a staff, against both lines and spaces, to ensure that they were<br/>not obscured and that it was clear what they applied to.

Please accept that<br/>others are entitled to different opinions.</p><p>&gt; &gt; Then again, we probably haven&apos;t done such a great job of explaining<br/>&gt; &gt; it. I&apos;d love for a professional educator or writer to volunteer to<br/>&gt; &gt; write about sagittal, particularly for non-math types.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; If the symbols are proposed for flexible usage then I&apos;m sorry, you&apos;ve<br/>&gt; done a rotten job explaining it. Why not just start out by giving a<br/>&gt; list of symbols with a primary interpretation, along with things you<br/>&gt; think would be reasonable as a secondary interpretation?</p><p>See the second paragraph on page 1.</p><p>&quot;In the early stages of the discussion, one idea that surfaced<br/>repeatedly was that a set of symbols indicating prime-number commatic<br/>alterations to tones in a Pythagorean series might be used to notate<br/>both rational intervals (e.g. just intonation) and equal divisions of<br/>the octave. ... As a first step, Gene Ward Smith suggested that it<br/>would be desirable that there be no more than one comma symbol per<br/>prime number, and a selection of 19-limit commas was tentatively<br/>identified to define the semantics of the notation.&quot;</p><p>And see table 1 on page 8.</p><p>It is a list of symbols with primary and secondary interpretations.</p><p>&gt; Then you<br/>&gt; could say you envision the primary use of such a set as being a way<br/>&gt; to extend standard staff notation, in which case something which<br/>&gt; plays the role of a generator fifth is presumed to be available? If<br/>&gt; that isn&apos;t made clear, it&apos;s then not that clear you are even allowed<br/>&gt; to notate Palestrina using Sagittal, because of the non-optimality of<br/>&gt; the 1/4 comma fifth in extended meantone. You could then go on to say<br/>&gt; other staff arragements and other generators can be adapted to the<br/>&gt; scheme also,</p><p>See the first paragraph of page 2 (the fourth paragraph of the article):</p><p>&quot;The Sagittal notation uses a conventional staff on which the natural<br/>notes are in a single series of fifths, with sharps and flats (and<br/>doubles thereof) indicating tones that are members of that same<br/>series, regardless of the particular tonal system being notated (see<br/>footnote 2). Therefore, if the notation is used for just intonation,<br/>these notes will indicate a Pythagorean tuning. For an equal division<br/>of the octave, they will indicate the tones in a series built on that<br/>division&apos;s best approximation of a fifth.&quot;</p><p>Footnote 2 reads:</p><p>&quot;The Sagittal accidentals may also be used in a consistent manner with<br/>systems that do not use a conventional staff, or have more or less<br/>than seven nominals, which may not be in a series of fifths, but that<br/>is beyond the scope of this article.&quot;</p><p>&gt; and try to do with a smile on your face instead of<br/>&gt; acting like the Sagittal Police, which is how you&apos;ve been coming<br/>&gt; across.</p><p>You missed have the smileys.

When you wrote:</p><p>&quot;Now, how would this best work in Sagittal?

You had seemed to prefer that sort of<br/>thing in the past. Hence my answer.</p><p>&quot;It&apos;s valid ...&quot;</p><p>But I recall now that you recently said something to someone else to<br/>the effect that there are plenty of Sagittals so why stack them. Now I<br/>realise you were asking for symbol pairs for the remaing degrees. My<br/>most humble apologies for what must have been terribly frustrating.</p><p>George tried to answer, but he in fact gave several commas (and one<br/>symbol) that were valid for 171-EDO, but not for enneadecal.</p><p>It turns out that George&apos;s and my disagreement over the 8G symbol was<br/>because George was notating 171-ET while I was notating Tom&apos;s planar<br/>1/3-comma temperament. Neither symbol is valid for 8G of enneadecal<br/>but when you drop the accents, all those we gave for other numbers of<br/>generators are valid for enneadecal.</p><p>I applied the 7-limit enneadecal mapping [[19, 30, 44, 53], [0, 1, 1,<br/>3]] to every 7-limit comma on my list and found the following.</p><p>Sagittal accidentals (in long ASCII form) for Gene&apos;s enneadecal notation:</p><p>gen. up   comma<br/>--- ----- -----------<br/>1G  &apos;|(   225/224<br/>2G  ~|(.  245/243<br/>and ~|(.. 126/125<br/>3G  /|    81/80<br/>4G  &apos;|)   3645/3584<br/>5G  ~|)   49/48<br/>6G //|    6561/6400<br/>7G &apos;/|)   59049/57344</p><p>I couldn&apos;t find any reasonable 7-limit comma for 8G of enneadecal but<br/>that doesn&apos;t really matter because, as you point out, we only need 4<br/>pairs to notate its 171-MOS/DE.</p><p>However the 11-limit mapping turned up the following<br/>8G &apos;/|\   1082565/1048576</p><p>Now, when you drop the accents you have the following pairs of single<br/>ASCII characters.

Since the exact symbols for 243:245 and 125:126<br/>are ~|(. and ~|(.. respectively (i.e., the 17C symbol with single-<br/>and double-right accent marks), it&apos;s perfectly fine to omit the right-<br/>accent marks if you don&apos;t need to make pitch distinctions as small as<br/>0.4 cents, so that the unaccented symbol ~|( will represent either<br/>one, or both.  So you can use whichever ratio you choose.</p><p>The shorthand for ~|( is in the 2G line, below.</p><p>&gt; &gt; Sagittal accidentals (in short ASCII form) for Gene&apos;s enneadecal<br/>notation:<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; gen. down up<br/>&gt; &gt; ---  ---- --<br/>&gt; &gt; 1G     c   r<br/>&gt; &gt; 2G     a   g<br/>&gt; &gt; 3G     \   /<br/>&gt; &gt; 4G     t   f<br/>&gt; &gt; 5G     h   p<br/>&gt; &gt; 6G     _   =<br/>&gt; &gt; 7G     u   n<br/>&gt; &gt; 8G     v   ^<br/>&gt; ...<br/>&gt; &gt; But you could actually help us here, by taking the values given<br/>for<br/>&gt; &gt; the accents in the Sagiital-2 spreadsheet and looking at possible<br/>&gt; &gt; combinations of left accents and single or double right accents<br/>with<br/>&gt; &gt; at least the Athenian (green background) symbols and telling us<br/>what<br/>&gt; &gt; 23-limit commas you think they should represent. Best do it on<br/>&gt; &gt; tuning-math though, not here.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I no longer have much of a clue what you are looking for in 23-<br/>limit<br/>&gt; commas; long, long ago and far, fae away in another galaxy we were<br/>&gt; considering JI when looking at those.</p><p>Never mind, then.  I think Dave was just extending the courtesy of<br/>inviting you to participate in our ongoing (and very detailed)<br/>discussion about symbol definitions (which he&apos;s pretty much left to<br/>me to finish up, since it&apos;s gotten to be so tedious).  By the time<br/>this is done, we expect to end up with separate symbols for perhaps<br/>150 to 200 different ratios less than 1/2 apotome, and I expect that<br/>just about anything you&apos;ll need will be covered.</p><p>One thing that would help is: if there&apos;s anything you can think of<br/>that we might be likely to miss, then please let us know.</p><p>--George</p></div><h3>Gene Ward Smith &#x3C;genewardsmith@coolgoose.com&#x3E;</h3><span>3/13/2007 12:47:55 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;George D.
