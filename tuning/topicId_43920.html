Somehow it has been missed that if you look at one of her first diagrams  you have the common tone modulations of various subharmonic series. Which every 1st<br/>grade tuning person should know contains the diamond or the lambdoma.  Her weakness possibly is placing it more far reaching than it is. On the other hand Erv Wilson has a large collection of flutes from around the world (he even gave<br/>Partch the one used in delusion) and often has played me these subharmonic scales and illustrated how they could have been assimulated in to the pythagorean chain in Indian music (for example).</p><p>&gt;</p><p>-- -Kraig Grady<br/>North American Embassy of Anaphoria Island<br/> <a href="http://www.anaphoria.com">http://www.anaphoria.com</a><br/>The Wandering Medicine Show<br/> KXLU 88.9 FM WED 8-9PM PST</p></div>
