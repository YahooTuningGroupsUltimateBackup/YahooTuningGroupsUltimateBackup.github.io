I notice that, on the piano, the best way to play a widely spaced chord, such as the mag 7th chord F2-A5-E6-G6, is to play the bottom note much softer than the upper three.  That way, the upper partials of the bottom root note sympathetically vibrate with the upper three notes --all four strings vibrating together.  Whith this sypmpathetic vibration, does the upper cluster of three notes vibrate as loudly as the bass note?  maybe this doesnt make any sense..sorry.  thanks for your opinion, Kelly</p></div>
