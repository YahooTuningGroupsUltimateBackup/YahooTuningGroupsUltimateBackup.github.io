In<br/>the early 1990s I wrote several little BASIC programs that did<br/>various aspects of calculating or graphing ratios, but it&apos;s<br/>only very recently that development on my JustMusic project<br/>has really taken off.

Right now it can<br/>handle up to 13-limit, but we are working on increasing the<br/>prime/odd-limit and also including capability to diagram n-tETs<br/>(which is easy) as well as CETs (which I need to think about<br/>some more).</p><p>Scales can be analyzed and modified either in the lattice<br/>window or in a database table format.

I thought you went to parallelogram lattices<br/>&gt; before or at the time you went beyond 5-limit.</p><p>The original drawings I made of Ellis&apos;s 5-limit systems were<br/>tetrahedral, akin to Partch&apos;s Diamonds.</p><p>At the time, I was interested in constructing a more-or-less-fixed<br/>19-limit system, and the problem I was having was where to put<br/>the 7-, 11-, 13-, 17-, and 19-limit ratios.</p><p>I could see that it was fairly easy to incorporate 7, because it<br/>gave a 3-dimensional layout similar to Fokker&apos;s (with which I was<br/>unfamiliar at the time).  But including 11 and the rest was<br/>perplexing.</p><p>It was when I independently stumbled upon the realization that<br/>Ellis&apos;s Duodenarium illustrated prime-factorization (of 3 and 5)<br/>that I began to prefer the simplicity and logic of the<br/>parallelogram design.</p><p>I stayed with this design, using a 3x5 grid or matrix layout<br/>(think of it as a plane), which could be reproduced like rungs<br/>of a ladder for all the higher primes, until a year ago.</p><p>Even tho I used it for a few years, I still wasn&apos;t entirely<br/>pleased with this type of design, because it was difficult to<br/>portray prime-factors higher than 5 which were raised to powers<br/>higher than +/- 1.</p><p>In May of 1998, when I &apos;broke thru the lattice barrier&apos;, I<br/>realized that giving each vector a unique angle would allow me<br/>to incorporate any prime at any power.  Of course, this design<br/>had been used and published, in a somewhat less complex fashion,<br/>by Erv Wilson and John Chalmers as long ago as the late 1960s<br/>(see the Wilson Archives at <a href="http://www.anaphoria.com">www.anaphoria.com</a>), and has already<br/>been incorporated in software on the Mac - I believe it&apos;s<br/>JICalc (? - I&apos;m a PC user) - but I wasn&apos;t aware of any of this<br/>until late last year, after I had thought of it independently.</p><p>As I&apos;ve said here before, I don&apos;t have any serious reservations<br/>against using tetrahedral lattices, and the reason I generally<br/>don&apos;t show the triangular connections on my lattices is simply<br/>because they clutter it up too much.</p><p>The reason I prefer the parallelogram design is because I find<br/>it just a tad bit more logical and simple than the tetradhedral,<br/>altho it has its drawbacks too, as Paul has pointed out.  Chief<br/>among them is the implications of sonance or complexity given<br/>by the spatial distance between certain ratio points.</p><p>The beautiful thing about the JustMusic software which Ken Fasano<br/>and I are developing is that it will allow the user to change<br/>the view of a scale or system to a number of different lattice<br/>designs, so that the unique information provided by all the<br/>different designs can be viewed at once and compared.</p><p>The two designs already implemented are my &apos;Monzo&apos; lattice<br/>design, with which most of you should be familiar and which<br/>can be seen on my website, and my &apos;Planetary&apos; graph, which<br/>places the &apos;octave&apos;-reduced ratios around a circle representing<br/>the &apos;octave&apos;.  Thus I can see the prime-factor layout with<br/>the &apos;Monzo&apos; lattice, as well as the logarithmic intervallic<br/>distance between the pitches with the &apos;Planetary&apos; graph.</p><p>And it can read any rational Scala file.   :)<br/>(and eventually, the irrational ones too)</p><p>And of course the most powerful aspect of it will be sequencer<br/>(i.e., real-time) capability.</p><p>-monz</p><p>Joseph L.
