This simply means<br/>that it takes two inputs, one of which controls the horizontal position,<br/>the other the vertical (in &quot;normal&quot; scope operation, the horizontal axis<br/>is reserved for the sweep of time, and all inputs are expressed in the<br/>vertical axis).</p><p>I run the output of my Korg M-1 synth to the scope: left channel to<br/>horizontal and right channel to vertical (or the reverse; it doesn&apos;t<br/>matter).  Then I select a horn voice, using effects processor to<br/>include unequal delay in L and R channels.  Play chords (4:5:6 and<br/>4:5:6:7 are solid starters) with and without JI tuning and voila!<br/>Unbelievable, hypnotic results with JI; ugly chaotic mess with 12-tET.</p><p>I&apos;ve had people tell me, when I previewed what they would see, that they<br/>knew I was fibbing, then have watched their eyes bug out.</p><p>The best part is that newcomers are hearing chords that sound &quot;wrong&quot; to<br/>their 12-tET-blasted ears, yet are seeing pictures that are clearly so<br/>much more beautiful than those in ET.  I think this might help them give<br/>JI more hearings, before dismissing it as odd or uninteresting.</p><p>I have only one caution to others: be careful of your common ground.  I<br/>use a 10K resistor between the ground of the synth output and the ground<br/>of the oscilloscope input, just in case the two of them want to fight<br/>each other in any way (they probably won&apos;t, especially if they trace<br/>back to the same wall outlet, a good practice!).  The 10K is transparent<br/>to the miniscule current needed to drive the scope input, but is enough<br/>to limit the effects of any voltage disagreement between the two<br/>instruments&apos; grounds.</p><p>JdL</p></div><h3>alves@xxxxx.xx.xxx.xxxxxxxxxxxxxxx)</h3><span>3/8/1999 10:50:47 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Those interested in JI oscilloscope images or laser images from vibrating<br/>mirrors should check out:</p><p>Pellegrino, Ronald. _The Electronic Arts of Light and Sound_.
