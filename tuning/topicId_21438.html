He has a harmolodic theorgy based on playing in C, Bb, and Eb simultaneously.  Ornette invented a Harmoldoic clef.  The harmonies connect based on a dimished seventh chord.</p><p>The intonation &quot;goes microtonal&quot; in the sense that pitches are quicked to either one direction or another.  It is not intellectual, and seems to require playing by memory.</p><p>I am schedule to meet with Ornette in early May about a collaboration.  He does understand what I mean by microtonal and is most sympathetic.  Whether he wants to walk down a different intonational road is to be seen.  He has a wonderful way with people, very relaxed.</p><p>Johnny Reinhard</p></div>
