It is similar to my 3 black 4 black 16 tone<br/>scale where the basic scale is a 7 tone that first by coincidence also first appears on the<br/>black keys! Neither of these scale i would imagine would be for beginners:) BTW I would<br/>probably color  texture code some of the keys to make the visual overload easier.</p><p>Paul Erlich wrote:</p><p>&gt; The ultimate application of my mapping is to physically remove all<br/>&gt; the &quot;E&quot;s from the keyboard, and close up the resulting spaces, as<br/>&gt; Steven Rezsutek actually did. See the last three figures of<br/>&gt; <a href="http://www.cix.co.uk/~gbreed/instrum.htm">http://www.cix.co.uk/~gbreed/instrum.htm</a> (hey Graham, the last two<br/>&gt; don&apos;t seem to be showing up). This combines the one key, one step<br/>&gt; property that you value with the properties I value:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; (a) scales look the same when transposed by an octave;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; (b) the essential 7-limit scales -- decatonics -- are easy to see and<br/>&gt; to play, using a system of key signatures that begins with all black<br/>&gt; keys and alters these one-by-one to white keys.</p><p>-- Kraig Grady<br/>North American Embassy of Anaphoria island<br/><a href="http://www.anaphoria.com">www.anaphoria.com</a></p></div>
