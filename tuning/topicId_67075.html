If you have a note between B and C that has its own name (as in my notation for blackwood, bug, kleismic, miracle, negri, and orwell temperaments among others), does it go in the same octave with the B below or the C above? Does it depend on whether the note is closer to B or closer to C?</p><p>It might make sense just to start the octave with C, but one way to notate the pitch between B and C is as a C with a half-flat symbol. This could cause all sorts of confusion if this note goes with the lower octave.

The important<br/>point is that the entire PIS is based on one reference<br/>pitch, which was called _mese_ {&quot;middle&quot;) and which was<br/>exactly in the middle of the pitch-range.</p><p>During the Greek and Roman era, the notes could be tuned<br/>to a wide variety of different pitches, resulting in the<br/>various different genera. After the German invasions (late<br/>400s AD), use of the chromatic and enharmonic genera died<br/>out, leaving only the diatonic.</p><p><a href="http://tonalsoft.com/enc/d/diatonic-genus.aspx">http://tonalsoft.com/enc/d/diatonic-genus.aspx</a></p><p>Boethius (c.505) had used Roman letters to represent<br/>pitches in many of his diagrams, but he did not recognize<br/>any kind of pitch-equivalence in his naming schemes, and<br/>often used the entire alphabet and then continued from<br/>the beginning using double letters. But he used the Roman<br/>letters mainly to designate points on his diagrams, in a<br/>geometric sense, and so the order of the letters generally<br/>does not even reflect pitch order.</p><p>It was during the time of Charlemagne (c.800) that our<br/>modern music-theory originated. The Frankish theorists<br/>did not read Greek, and struggled to find ways to represent<br/>musical pitches in writing, utilizing what they knew of the<br/>ancient PIS (diatonic genus only). Also, at this point,<br/>the only standard tuning in European theory became 3-limit<br/>&quot;pythagorean&quot; tuning.</p><p>In the late 900s, the pseudo-Odo _Dialogus_ was the first<br/>treatise to use the Roman alphabet to represent pitches<br/>in pitch order. The ascending order was chosen, even tho<br/>the ancient Greeks actually reckoned their scales in<br/>descending order, and the reference pitch _mese_ obviously<br/>became &quot;A&quot;. I discuss some of this in a post from last year:</p><p><a href="/tuning/topicId_62290.html#62442">/tuning/topicId_62290.html#62442</a></p><p>Thus, the entire PIS was written:</p><p>A B C D E F G a b c d e f g aa</p><p>_mese_ was &quot;a&quot;, and the &quot;b&quot; above it was either a semitone<br/>or whole-tone above &quot;a&quot; (i.e., either a B or Bb), depending<br/>on the tetrachord employed. And it stayed this way for<br/>about 600 years.</p><p>Now, about the shift to C ...</p><p>It was during the centuries from about 1300 to 1500 that<br/>shift ocurred. In part, it was because of the increasing<br/>use of keyboard instruments, and ultimately, it was because<br/>of the recognition of prime-factor 5 as an element in the<br/>ratios of musical harmony, i.e., &quot;5-limit JI&quot;.</p><p>The standard 7-white/5-black keyboard appeared in this<br/>form for the first time in the Halberstadt organ in 1361.<br/>From that time on, it became fairly common for musicians<br/>to describe as &quot;A&quot; the note we now know as &quot;C&quot;. This is<br/>obviously because, with the ascending orientation, the<br/>scale which we today call C-major, where the &quot;do re mi fa<br/>sol la ti&quot; appears on the white keys, was felt to be the<br/>most natural one, thus its tonic was often called &quot;A&quot;.<br/>But the older nomenclature persisted, and is the one<br/>which ultimately survived as the one we still use today.</p><p>The earliest mention of 5-limit ratios in post-classical<br/>theory are from Theinred of Dover (1100s) and Walter<br/>Odington (1300s), both in England. The first theorist to<br/>give measurements for a monochord which form a true<br/>5-limit basis for a musical tuning was Ramos:</p><p><a href="http://tonalsoft.com/monzo/ramos/ramos.htm">http://tonalsoft.com/monzo/ramos/ramos.htm</a></p><p>(and even at this late date we can see Ramos using letters<br/>to represent geometric points on his diagrams, just as with<br/>Boethius -- this time recognizing pitch order but still<br/>not recognizing octave-equivalence.)</p><p>Within about 70 years, this led to Zarlino&apos;s 1558 treatise<br/>_Le institutione harmoniche_, which laid the foundation<br/>for modern music-theory:</p><p><a href="http://www.sonic-arts.org/monzo/zarlino/1558/zarlino1558-2.htm">http://www.sonic-arts.org/monzo/zarlino/1558/zarlino1558-2.htm</a></p><p>By this time, the practice of calling the &quot;do&quot; of the<br/>major scale &quot;A&quot; had pretty much died out, and so it was<br/>established as &quot;C&quot;.</p><p>Zarlino stated that all consonances are based on the<br/>_senario_, ratios using only the numbers 1,2,3,4,5,6.<br/>He defined the PIS (diatonic genus only) in 5-limit terms<br/>as illustrated on the following lattice:</p><p>(horizontal axis = powers of 3, vertical axis = powers of 5;<br/>to view correctly on the Yahoo web interface, click on<br/>&quot;Option&quot; under the date at the right of this message, then<br/>click &quot;Use Fixed Width Font&quot;.)</p><p>.....| -1 ..... 0 ...... 1 ..... 2 ..... 3<br/>-----|--------------------------------------<br/>.. 0 |. d&apos; ..

Because the numbers<br/>here are exactly the same in either interpretation, i<br/>would posit that either interpretation is equally valid.</p><p>However, for the simpler triads which were the basis of<br/>both Zarlino&apos;s theory and the whole era of classical music,<br/>the C-major triad would be otonal 4:5:6 and utonal 1/(15:12:10);<br/>conversely, the E-minor triad would be otonal 10:12:15 and<br/>utonal 1/(6:5:4). Obviously, the otonal interpretation is<br/>better for major triads, and utonal is better for minor.</p><p>This led to the simplification of classification, so that<br/>the number of modes was reduced to only two: major or minor.</p><p>Anyway, the major scale was felt to be the overriding<br/>basis of musical pitch resources, and because the C-major<br/>scale is the one which has no accidentals and appears in<br/>straightforward fashion on the white keys of the keyboard,<br/>the entire gamut of pitches was standardized so that its<br/>nomenclature defines octaves ascending as C D E F G A B.</p><p>-monz<br/><a href="http://tonalsoft.com">http://tonalsoft.com</a><br/>Tonescape microtonal music software</p></div><h3><a id=67123 href="#67123">ðŸ”—</a>Ozan Yarman &#x3C;ozanyarman@ozanyarman.com&#x3E;</h3><span>7/5/2006 3:54:26 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>This is an excellent summary on the music theory of European Dark Ages that<br/>I would like to copy-paste directly into my thesis (with proper references<br/>of course), if it is alright with you dear monz.</p><p>Cordially,<br/>Oz.</p><p>----- Original Message -----<br/>From: &quot;monz&quot; &lt;<a href="mailto:monz@tonalsoft.com">monz@tonalsoft.com</a>&gt;<br/>To: &lt;<a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>&gt;<br/>Sent: 05 Temmuz 2006 &iuml;&iquest;&half;ar&iuml;&iquest;&half;amba 12:11<br/>Subject: [tuning] how the reference pitch changed from A to C (was: how<br/>about this for a pattern)</p><p>&gt; hi Herman, Carl, et al,<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; --- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, Herman Miller &lt;hmiller@...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; Carl Lumma wrote:<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; A G# A E A E B E c B c A c A d A<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; It doesn&apos;t answer whether G# is lower or higher than A.<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; One wonders if this Helmholtz fellow knew what he was doing.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; You know, it does seem strange that octaves traditionally<br/>&gt; &gt; start with C instead of A.

After the German invasions (late<br/>&gt; 400s AD), use of the chromatic and enharmonic genera died<br/>&gt; out, leaving only the diatonic.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; <a href="http://tonalsoft.com/enc/d/diatonic-genus.aspx">http://tonalsoft.com/enc/d/diatonic-genus.aspx</a><br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Boethius (c.505) had used Roman letters to represent<br/>&gt; pitches in many of his diagrams, but he did not recognize<br/>&gt; any kind of pitch-equivalence in his naming schemes, and<br/>&gt; often used the entire alphabet and then continued from<br/>&gt; the beginning using double letters. But he used the Roman<br/>&gt; letters mainly to designate points on his diagrams, in a<br/>&gt; geometric sense, and so the order of the letters generally<br/>&gt; does not even reflect pitch order.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; It was during the time of Charlemagne (c.800) that our<br/>&gt; modern music-theory originated. The Frankish theorists<br/>&gt; did not read Greek, and struggled to find ways to represent<br/>&gt; musical pitches in writing, utilizing what they knew of the<br/>&gt; ancient PIS (diatonic genus only). Also, at this point,<br/>&gt; the only standard tuning in European theory became 3-limit<br/>&gt; &quot;pythagorean&quot; tuning.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; In the late 900s, the pseudo-Odo _Dialogus_ was the first<br/>&gt; treatise to use the Roman alphabet to represent pitches<br/>&gt; in pitch order. The ascending order was chosen, even tho<br/>&gt; the ancient Greeks actually reckoned their scales in<br/>&gt; descending order, and the reference pitch _mese_ obviously<br/>&gt; became &quot;A&quot;. I discuss some of this in a post from last year:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; <a href="/tuning/topicId_62290.html#62442">/tuning/topicId_62290.html#62442</a><br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Thus, the entire PIS was written:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; A B C D E F G a b c d e f g aa<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; _mese_ was &quot;a&quot;, and the &quot;b&quot; above it was either a semitone<br/>&gt; or whole-tone above &quot;a&quot; (i.e., either a B or Bb), depending<br/>&gt; on the tetrachord employed. And it stayed this way for<br/>&gt; about 600 years.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Now, about the shift to C ...<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; It was during the centuries from about 1300 to 1500 that<br/>&gt; shift ocurred. In part, it was because of the increasing<br/>&gt; use of keyboard instruments, and ultimately, it was because<br/>&gt; of the recognition of prime-factor 5 as an element in the<br/>&gt; ratios of musical harmony, i.e., &quot;5-limit JI&quot;.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; The standard 7-white/5-black keyboard appeared in this<br/>&gt; form for the first time in the Halberstadt organ in 1361.<br/>&gt; &gt;From that time on, it became fairly common for musicians<br/>&gt; to describe as &quot;A&quot; the note we now know as &quot;C&quot;. This is<br/>&gt; obviously because, with the ascending orientation, the<br/>&gt; scale which we today call C-major, where the &quot;do re mi fa<br/>&gt; sol la ti&quot; appears on the white keys, was felt to be the<br/>&gt; most natural one, thus its tonic was often called &quot;A&quot;.<br/>&gt; But the older nomenclature persisted, and is the one<br/>&gt; which ultimately survived as the one we still use today.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; The earliest mention of 5-limit ratios in post-classical<br/>&gt; theory are from Theinred of Dover (1100s) and Walter<br/>&gt; Odington (1300s), both in England. The first theorist to<br/>&gt; give measurements for a monochord which form a true<br/>&gt; 5-limit basis for a musical tuning was Ramos:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; <a href="http://tonalsoft.com/monzo/ramos/ramos.htm">http://tonalsoft.com/monzo/ramos/ramos.htm</a><br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; (and even at this late date we can see Ramos using letters<br/>&gt; to represent geometric points on his diagrams, just as with<br/>&gt; Boethius -- this time recognizing pitch order but still<br/>&gt; not recognizing octave-equivalence.)<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Within about 70 years, this led to Zarlino&apos;s 1558 treatise<br/>&gt; _Le institutione harmoniche_, which laid the foundation<br/>&gt; for modern music-theory:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; <a href="http://www.sonic-arts.org/monzo/zarlino/1558/zarlino1558-2.htm">http://www.sonic-arts.org/monzo/zarlino/1558/zarlino1558-2.htm</a><br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; By this time, the practice of calling the &quot;do&quot; of the<br/>&gt; major scale &quot;A&quot; had pretty much died out, and so it was<br/>&gt; established as &quot;C&quot;.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Zarlino stated that all consonances are based on the<br/>&gt; _senario_, ratios using only the numbers 1,2,3,4,5,6.<br/>&gt; He defined the PIS (diatonic genus only) in 5-limit terms<br/>&gt; as illustrated on the following lattice:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; (horizontal axis = powers of 3, vertical axis = powers of 5;<br/>&gt; to view correctly on the Yahoo web interface, click on<br/>&gt; &quot;Option&quot; under the date at the right of this message, then<br/>&gt; click &quot;Use Fixed Width Font&quot;.)<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; .....| -1 ..... 0 ...... 1 ..... 2 ..... 3<br/>&gt; -----|--------------------------------------<br/>&gt; .. 0 |. d&apos; ..

D,d<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; In ascending pitch order:<br/>&gt; A, B, C, D, E, F, G, a, b, h, c, d, d&apos;, e, f, g, aa<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; (I use &quot;d&apos;&quot; to distinguish that note from &quot;d&quot;, but<br/>&gt; Zarlino didn&apos;t -- the proper tuning would be evident<br/>&gt; from the context of which tetrachord the note appeared in.<br/>&gt; Also note the &quot;b&quot; for Bb and &quot;h&quot; for B-natural.)<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Note that Zarlino is using &quot;A&quot; as his 1/1!<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Within this limited pitch universe, Zarlino posited the<br/>&gt; C-major scale as the &quot;natural&quot; one, and the lattice<br/>&gt; demonstrates that its three main chords, which we today<br/>&gt; would call I, IV, and V, are all triads with 4:5:6<br/>&gt; proportions, the most consonant possible in the 5-limit.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Zarlino&apos;s theory was tremendously influential, and formed<br/>&gt; the basis for the subsequent use of &quot;C&quot; as the reference<br/>&gt; pitch.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Glearean came shortly after Zarlino and actually rearranged<br/>&gt; the system of modes so that C was made the reference note.<br/>&gt; But largely due to Zarlino&apos;s theory, the whole system of<br/>&gt; modes had by 1700 morphed into the &quot;common-practice&quot;<br/>&gt; major/minor system of keys.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; In my book _JustMusic: A New Harmony_:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; <a href="http://tonalsoft.com/monzo/book/book.htm">http://tonalsoft.com/monzo/book/book.htm</a><br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; i put forth the thesis that it is the duality of possible<br/>&gt; rational interpretations of JI tuning systems which led<br/>&gt; to the transformation of the old modal system into the<br/>&gt; major/minor key system.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; For example, on the lattice above which shows Zarlino&apos;s<br/>&gt; system, the major-7th chord C-E-G-h could be interpreted<br/>&gt; either as the otonal proportions 8:10:12:15 or as the<br/>&gt; utonal proportions 1/(15:12:10:8). Because the numbers<br/>&gt; here are exactly the same in either interpretation, i<br/>&gt; would posit that either interpretation is equally valid.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; However, for the simpler triads which were the basis of<br/>&gt; both Zarlino&apos;s theory and the whole era of classical music,<br/>&gt; the C-major triad would be otonal 4:5:6 and utonal 1/(15:12:10);<br/>&gt; conversely, the E-minor triad would be otonal 10:12:15 and<br/>&gt; utonal 1/(6:5:4). Obviously, the otonal interpretation is<br/>&gt; better for major triads, and utonal is better for minor.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; This led to the simplification of classification, so that<br/>&gt; the number of modes was reduced to only two: major or minor.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Anyway, the major scale was felt to be the overriding<br/>&gt; basis of musical pitch resources, and because the C-major<br/>&gt; scale is the one which has no accidentals and appears in<br/>&gt; straightforward fashion on the white keys of the keyboard,<br/>&gt; the entire gamut of pitches was standardized so that its<br/>&gt; nomenclature defines octaves ascending as C D E F G A B.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; -monz<br/>&gt; <a href="http://tonalsoft.com">http://tonalsoft.com</a><br/>&gt; Tonescape microtonal music software<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;</p></div><h3><a id=67127 href="#67127">ðŸ”—</a>Tom Dent &#x3C;stringph@gmail.com&#x3E;</h3><span>7/6/2006 2:44:42 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, Herman Miller &lt;hmiller@...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Carl Lumma wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt; A G# A E A E B E c B c A c A d A<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; It doesn&apos;t answer whether G# is lower or higher than A.<br/>&gt; &gt; One wonders if this Helmholtz fellow knew what he was doing.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; You know, it does seem strange that octaves traditionally start with C<br/>&gt; instead of A.
