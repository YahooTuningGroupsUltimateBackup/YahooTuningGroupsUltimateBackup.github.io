And again, (1), (2), and (3) give you ways of<br/>understanding the &apos;TH&apos;, not the &quot;integer limit&quot;.</p><p>&gt; So (perhaps failing to comprehensively consider the full meaning<br/>&gt;and/or implications of your statements, and their applicability or<br/>&gt;non-applicability to the concepts of which my mind has been<br/>&gt;engaged), it occured to me that - this &quot;undertone series&quot; business,<br/>&gt;and (what appears to be the associated) &quot;coincidence of periods&quot;<br/>&gt;business *should* (at least, &quot;could&quot;) have a corollary in the world<br/>&gt;of numerical analysis of musical tones... So (I thought), &quot;where is<br/>&gt;it&quot;?</p><p>The &quot;coincidence of periods&quot; business comes from a rather old view of<br/>psychoacoustics, mentioned by Terhardt, which holds that the shorter<br/>the wave period of the combined waveforms of the tones, the<br/>more &quot;consonant&quot; the sensation. Even Partch at one point seems to<br/>hold this view.</p><p>&gt;Upon reflection, it may be that I (alone) have brought an<br/>&gt;expectation (of a kind of &quot;related physical evidence&quot; existing in<br/>&gt;the realm of &quot;research surrounding aural perceptions&quot;) into my<br/>&gt;desires that a given numerical property (topology,<br/>&gt;pattern, &quot;periodicity&quot;, etc) *could* (at least in part) &quot;be found&quot;<br/>&gt;to objectively describe demonstrable physical phenomena which<br/>&gt;*might* appear to &quot;correlate&quot; with my own (I&apos;ll speak only for<br/>&gt;myself) subjective sensory impressions.</p><p>Well, I think I&apos;m with you on that, but a simple rule like the ones<br/>we&apos;ve been considering obviously breaks down for ratios such as<br/>3001:2001, which is very consonant, despite the extreme height of the<br/>lowest common overtone, the extreme length of the wave period,<br/>etc. . . . This is why I developed the harmonic entropy theory, so<br/>that a very simple conceptual/mathematical model could still account<br/>for my sensory impressions quite well.</p></div><h3>Ray Tomes &#x3C;rtomes@kcbbs.gen.nz&#x3E;</h3><span>12/20/2001 2:45:08 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #ddd'><b>Attachments</b></div><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>While a lot of music fits the implied fundamental frequency, there are<br/>also many cases of implied fundamental period.
