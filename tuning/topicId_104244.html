This came from the basic result, which is<br/>in accordance with the initial desiderata I posed, that the best<br/>rank-2 systems for this criteria are those which avoid the generator<br/>being close to a simple rational division of the period. Scales which<br/>fail to do so inevitably end up generating a ton of very small<br/>comma-sized intervals, and hence will also generate a lot of MOS&apos;s<br/>with nearly-equal intervals that differ only by these comma-sized<br/>intervals (e.g. in the role of c). To reiterate, I suggest that<br/>intervals which differ only by a very small amount are more difficult<br/>to tell apart than intervals which differ by a larger amount, and<br/>hence scales like this will generate a lot of very close, ambiguous<br/>intervals.</p><p>As a second pass in modeling this same feature, we might resurrect our<br/>old friend, the Harmonic Entropy curve: much like ?(x), this also<br/>allows rationals to compete with one another, weighted by their<br/>complexity, and allows us to find the spots that are maximally close<br/>and far from them. However, this time, there&apos;s a twist: since we&apos;re<br/>trying to avoid simple fractions of the period, the ratios we&apos;re going<br/>to use will now be in -linear- space, not logarithmic space.</p><p>Note that in this case, we&apos;re not saying that there&apos;s some process in<br/>the brain that matches intervals to equal divisions of the period.<br/>However, we are saying that a listener won&apos;t be able to distinguish<br/>between intervals that are really close in size, such as 399 and 402<br/>cents, and so will tend to perceive those intervals as being the same<br/>interval, or perhaps different intonations of the same interval. And,<br/>we&apos;re saying that as a side effect of this, a scale generated by a 399<br/>cent interval will tend to produce lots of these ambiguous intervals,<br/>and that this effect simply happens more as the generators get close<br/>to simple rational divisions of the period. The &quot;fields of attraction&quot;<br/>here could perhaps instead to be thought of as &quot;fields of repulsion&quot; -<br/>things we want to avoid - and hence we&apos;ll look for maxima in the<br/>resulting curve.</p><p>Let&apos;s make sure that HE is at least modeling the cursory aspects of<br/>the behavior of MOS scales and ambiguous intervals correctly in ways<br/>that agree with the other plots I&apos;ve posted.</p><p>Firstly, we want to make sure that simple rationals are worse to be<br/>near than complex ones. For instance, a generator that&apos;s 585 cents<br/>will tend to generate a bunch of small 15-cent intervals early in its<br/>MOS series, but a generator that&apos;s 285 cents will generate small<br/>intervals of 60-cents early in its MOS series, which is four times<br/>better. HE does this by assigning simpler rationals a larger field of<br/>attraction.</p><p>Secondly, for the simple rationals, we want to make sure that<br/>generators get a worse rating if they get closer to a rational number,<br/>because the ambiguous comma-sized intervals produced, which will be<br/>chromata for the MOS&apos;s preceding their appearance, will be even<br/>smaller. HE obviously does that.</p><p>Thirdly, it&apos;s probably likely that complex rationals don&apos;t really<br/>matter at all, because you&apos;ll have to use really large MOS&apos;s before<br/>you start seeing any sign of ambiguity whatsoever. For instance, we<br/>probably don&apos;t care at all if the generator is tuned to something like<br/>29/50ths of a period, because we won&apos;t start seeing any c-ambiguity<br/>until we get to the 50-note MOS, nor any s-ambiguity until we get to<br/>the MOS that&apos;s one step larger (either 69 or 81 notes), nor any<br/>d-ambiguity until we get to the MOS that&apos;s one step smaller (31<br/>notes). If we note that the denominator thus reflects the largest<br/>effective MOS size we care about - or the largest equal division of<br/>the period we care about avoiding, which is more or less equivalent -<br/>HE allows us to model this by seeding the rationals with a Farey<br/>series, with the N cutoff bounding the complexity of the things we<br/>care about.</p><p>Fourthly, in order to make any claim that we&apos;re representing some<br/>MOS-agnostic property of generators themselves, it would be good to<br/>make sure that the curve converges as N goes up. HE mostly does this,<br/>but keeps increasing in height; if we can normalize this by dividing<br/>by the Harmonic Renyi Entropy of order 0 it can be shown empirically<br/>to converge.</p><p>Fifthly, we want to model the variation that likely exists in<br/>listeners&apos; abilities to distinguish between similarly-sized melodic<br/>intervals. For instance, one person may find intervals that differ by<br/>~30 cents to be very ambiguous, particularly in a melodic context, and<br/>tend to perhaps perceive them as different intonations of the same<br/>interval, whereas another person might find it pretty easy to<br/>distinguish between them as unique and totally different things. We<br/>also might want to model any contribution to this variation that<br/>timbre might provide. HE attempts to do all of this by smearing<br/>everything out with a Gaussian that takes its standard deviation as a<br/>free parameter. (You might argue that smearing things out cents-wise<br/>is a bad idea, but it&apos;s a start for now.)</p><p>So for now, it all seems decently solid. I&apos;ll be posting some plots in<br/>a minute to show how it looks.</p><p>-Mike</p></div><h3><a id=104252 href="#104252">ðŸ”—</a>Mike Battaglia &#x3C;battaglia01@...&#x3E;</h3><span>3/29/2012 8:18:38 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Rather than post plots, I just updated my online HE app to let you<br/>play around with linear HE. You can find it here:</p><p><a href="http://www.mikebattagliamusic.com/HE-JS/HE.html">http://www.mikebattagliamusic.com/HE-JS/HE.html</a></p><p>Here&apos;s a rather crammed plot showing the settings I used:</p><p><a href="http://launch.groups.yahoo.com/group/tuning/files/MikeBattaglia/HElins=0.6%.png">http://launch.groups.yahoo.com/group/tuning/files/MikeBattaglia/HElins=0.6%.png</a></p><p>I set a=2 for no other reason than that it very closely resembles<br/>exp(HE) with a=1, and hence makes it easier to see maxima. I also set<br/>N=100, but if you want you can try bringing it up to N=2000 if you<br/>want to verify that it appears to converge. The choice of s is<br/>non-trivial, and as I basically have no real data to see what value<br/>might be best, I just set it to 0.6% as a starting point in the<br/>picture above. This is about 7 or so cents.</p><p>Using the above settings, maxima pop out at (in no order)</p><p>737 cents - father, in about 13-EDO<br/>702 cents - pythagorean<br/>672 cents - mavila, in around 25-EDO<br/>422 cents - squares<br/>378 cents - magic, in about 16-EDO or 19-EDO<br/>320 cents - keemun/orgone, in about 15-EDO<br/>280 cents - a very sharp orwell, in about 17-EDO<br/>257 cents - semaphore, in about 14-EDO<br/>220 cents - machine, in about 11-EDO<br/>185 cents - glacial, in about 13-EDO<br/>159 cents - porcupine, in about 15-EDO</p><p>Although the generators have been shifted by a few cents, which has<br/>hence led to some different labels (like meantone being replaced by<br/>pythagorean), many of the same sorts of generators are popping up as<br/>before: something which creates the diatonic scale, something which<br/>creates the superdiatonic scale, something which creates father, etc.</p><p>A sensi-ish and dicot-ish generator didn&apos;t pop up this time, but if<br/>you change s to 0.4% to make it finer, the peak at 422 cents splits<br/>into two peaks at 415 and 441 cents, and the peak at 378 cents splits<br/>into two peaks at 384 cents and 353 cents. Additionally, the 702 cent<br/>peak splits into two at 707 and 697 cents, and the peak at 320 cents<br/>splits into 333 and 315 cent peaks.</p><p>It&apos;s hard to make any real predictions from this without any idea on<br/>how to set s, so these results must be treated as preliminary and are<br/>just to investigate the concept. While it&apos;s hard to use this model to<br/>make any claim about the superiority of any generator, it&apos;s noteworthy<br/>that many of the same sorts of generators keep turning up, although<br/>the generator sizes may change by a few cents and the relative<br/>ordering may change: we get things generating the ubiquitous diatonic<br/>scale, something that&apos;s close to father, sometimes sensi, and orgone,<br/>orwell, semaphore, machine, glacial, porcupine, etc. This shouldn&apos;t be<br/>too much of a shock, because if we set up models of the sort I&apos;ve<br/>proposed here, we&apos;ll typically see phi-based generators returning,<br/>especially the ones in which the L/s ratios of their MOS&apos;s hit phi<br/>quickly on in the series.</p><p>Play around and have fun with it. Next time we&apos;ll try to get past some<br/>of this confusion by tightening things up a bit more.</p><p>-Mike</p><p>On Thu, Mar 29, 2012 at 4:50 PM, Mike Battaglia &lt;battaglia01@...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; So for now, it all seems decently solid.
