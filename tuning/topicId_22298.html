found EXACTLY what I am looking for pokeing around a bit.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; You see, the other day, I had been woundering about a band called ART OF<br/>&gt; NOISE, and I had first heard one of their most famous songs called OPUS 4.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; They did a whole lot of others in the mid to late 1980&apos;s like Dragnet, and<br/>&gt; Peter Gunn.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I managed to get hold of this song OPUS 4, when I had played a friend of<br/>&gt; mind O SUPERMAN (made circa 1982 with tape loops/reels) by a woman called<br/>&gt; Laurie Anderson, and he made the mental connection as to the similarity<br/>&gt; between the two songs and played me Art of Noise&apos;s: OPUS 4.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;

And, it seemed uncanny, but I found the very thing that I was looking for,<br/>&gt; ===&gt; a fan&apos;s tribute to the Art of Noise, in which is known as THE ABDUCTION<br/>&gt; OF THE ART OF NOISE!<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Primarily, as nearly always is the case, the thing that I lack the most is<br/>&gt; money, and I am slowly and surely saving for of microtuneable sampler, and a<br/>&gt; computer upgrade.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I have, at present, an invention which is being submitted to HAMMER<br/>&gt; STRENGTH, an exercise equipment company, related to Arthur Jone&apos;s &quot;Nautilus&quot;<br/>&gt; (owned and founded by Gary Jone&apos;s, [Arthur&apos;s son]), and I am hopeing for a<br/>&gt; long shot about making money from this, amoungst many proects.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; The main point of this email, and please forgive me if it seems somewhat<br/>&gt; lengthy, is to ask if anybody would be interested in making variants on this<br/>&gt; song.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; There is no time limit, just the imagination.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Altho I would not be able, due to lack of resources, get it finished by the<br/>&gt; end date (May), still, oneday, I would like to see microtonal versions for<br/>&gt; Art of Noise.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Also, do checkout the famous poem by Thomas Hood on which the OPUS 4 was<br/>&gt; based:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; <a href="http://www.wallydug.demon.co.uk/wallydug/opus4.html">http://www.wallydug.demon.co.uk/wallydug/opus4.html</a><br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Notice, however (if you&apos;d ever heard Art of Noise&apos;s Opus 4) that not all of<br/>&gt; the words were used, and it was all a woman talking.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Question:  Are there available any downloadable software, even as shareware,<br/>&gt; that enables one to speak into the computer, in your own voice, and to have<br/>&gt; this voice converted to another person&apos;s voice?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I have heard this was done with Humpry Bogart&apos;s voice, and another famous<br/>&gt; actress, but the technology is somewhat sophistocated&mldr;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I feel that the only effective way to do this would be with a physical<br/>&gt; model.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; As I always say, down sampled, and time stretched birds sound SIMILAR to,<br/>&gt; but NOT EXACTLY LIKE whales.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; The same relationship exists with small and large dogs.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; A physical model is non-linear, in this sence&mldr;.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Can anybody provide links?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Whilst on the subject, of sound synthesis, I also thought that mathematical<br/>&gt; formula, like the ones I will often play around with inputting them in a<br/>&gt; mathematical formulae graphing programme (that only shows damn real<br/>&gt; numbers), could be made into waveforms, and some of these would surely sound<br/>&gt; interesting.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; PLEASE, AS MANY OF YOU TUNERS AS WHO CAN, RESPOND TO THIS EMAIL, AND I WOULD<br/>&gt; DEARLY LIKE TO MAKE A/SOME MICROTONAL VERSIONS OF OPUS 4, 5, 6, 7, 8,<br/>&gt; 9,&mldr;&mldr;ALEPH_NULL, as possible, even if not before may 2001, then oneday.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; As I said, it is resources that hold me up, and mostly money.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Someday, oneday, this may change, indeed, I have four month&apos;s to go on my<br/>&gt; provisional patent.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;</p><p>I would consider participating but could I get a little more info first? I<br/>have never heard the music, but I will look for a copy soon since it sounds<br/>interesting. What exatly are you looking for soeone to do some synthesis,<br/>manipulate sound files, manipulate the original audio? I might have some<br/>extra time coming up and I do some sound synth, let me know specifically what<br/>you are looking for. (I am not sure where you can find the physical modelling<br/>thing however)</p><p>ANdy</p></div>
