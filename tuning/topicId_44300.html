Actually,<br/>I used it on my last Blackjack piece, and I&apos;m continuing to use it.</p><p>Initially, when Paul and I were thinking about sonorities of the<br/>Blackjack scale, we made &quot;lists&quot; of sonorities and classified them<br/>according to &quot;consonance&quot; or &quot;dissonance.&quot;  They were, essentially,<br/>classified according to *parallel* chord patterns on the Halberstadt<br/>keyboard.</p><p>Then, I slavishly plotted common-tone harmonies from the Blackjack<br/>lattice.  I think I managed to get some music out of this, but in the<br/>same vein as making serial 12-tone music:  the method was a<br/>little &quot;contrived...&quot; and forced me into a very &quot;harmonic<br/>progression&quot; way of working.</p><p>My &quot;new&quot; way of thinking, if we can call it thinking, is to think of<br/>the Blackjack lattice as viewed from a kind of camera.  There&apos;s<br/>a &quot;zoom&quot; element to it.  In other words, pitches for chords that are<br/>outside the most integral &quot;resolution&quot; or the just paths described by<br/>the lattice, are, of course, usable:  they are just further from the<br/>main &quot;focus...&quot; (And, of course, their relationships would be more<br/>complex and &quot;remote&quot; than the linked lattice pitches.) The &quot;focus&quot; is<br/>the pure, virtually unbeating small ratio elements of the lattice.</p><p>Rather than *plotting* lattice pitches, or finding sounds through<br/>contrived parallel keyboard patterns (the worst idea), I&apos;m going<br/>strictly by *ear*, which is what I should have been doing in the<br/>first place!</p><p>Then, I consult the lattice and see how the pitches fit into<br/>the &quot;grander&quot; scheme of things.  Frequently, I&apos;ll have to &quot;adjust&quot;<br/>pitches when I find that I&apos;ve chosen a &quot;wrong&quot; note that doesn&apos;t fit<br/>into a simpler lattice scheme.  That is, of course, provided that the<br/>resulting sound is *perferential* to the &quot;error...&quot;  In some musical<br/>cases, of course, an &quot;error&quot; could be preferred...</p><p>I imagine the whole idea of approaching the lattice with different<br/>Blackjack pitches insofar as they relate progressively to the<br/>simplest, small ratio joined just lattice pitches could be described<br/>by some mathematical construct, not that I could or would want to try<br/>that.  It seems, in a way, a bit like Harmonic Entropy in the sense<br/>that one is examining a larger &quot;field&quot; and then narrowing it down<br/>(Paul most probably will contest this former statement...)</p><p>Anyway, this seems the most &quot;musical&quot; and &quot;intuitive&quot; way of working<br/>with the Blackjack lattice so far, using it as a &quot;reference&quot; tool,<br/>but not being it&apos;s abject slave...</p><p>J.
