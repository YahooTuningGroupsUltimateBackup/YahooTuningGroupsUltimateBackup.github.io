Why am I doing this??  Well, I want to<br/>canvass the *real* answers, not what people *think* performers are<br/>going to say and how they are or are not going to react.</p><p>This latest cellist is actually a friend of mine, Dan Barrett, who<br/>has *always* taken an interest in contemporary music, and it an<br/>incredibly sensitive and dedicated player.  He&apos;s performed some of my<br/>work before:  12-tET based, but with lots of glissandi and also some<br/>special effects.</p><p>However, I mentioned that this piece was in 72-tET.  The first<br/>reaction: &quot;oh sh*t Joe!  You know how much time that&apos;s going to<br/>take.&quot;  The impression was, also, that microtonality could mess up<br/>his playing.  As he gingerly stated, &quot;working with 31 equal and stuff<br/>like that can f*ck up your playing!&quot;</p><p>People really believe this.  The feel that if they play microtonality<br/>they will ruin their &quot;normal&quot; playing!  And, they also feel that it<br/>will take much too much time to learn to do microtonal works.</p><p>Well, I mentioned to Dan that 1)He really only had to learn THREE<br/>microtones, 1/4 tones, 1/6 tones and 1/12 tones.  He seemed to calm<br/>down a little then.  I also mentioned the practice CD which seemed to<br/>help.  Even better, I told him about the relationship of 72-tET to 12-<br/>tET and that, basically, the things I am going to be asking him to do<br/>are, fundamentally, alterations over his beloved 12-equal framework.</p><p>That seemed to help.  He&apos;s considering the piece.  He&apos;s a great<br/>player, so I hope he decides to do it.  I told him I thought it was a<br/>*benefit* to his playing and that my experience was that my<br/>intonation greatly *improved* for *any* kind of music after working<br/>with microtonality.</p><p>So we will see when he gets the score whether he thinks of my new<br/>_Blacklight_ piece as a &quot;learning experience&quot; or horribly, as<br/>something that will f*ck up his playing!!</p><p>To be continued....</p><p>Joseph Pehrson</p></div><h3><a id=39627 href="#39627">ðŸ”—</a>Jon Szanto &#x3C;JSZANTO@ADNC.COM&#x3E;</h3><span>10/15/2002 7:20:42 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Joe,</p><p>Thoughts on your dilemma:</p><p>1.

I&apos;m genuinely delighted<br/>that you are so interested in this process.  I agree with your<br/>sentiments, but, you see, this entire process is a little &quot;learning<br/>experience&quot; for me.  For example, I never would have thought that Dan<br/>Barrett, who is an excellent player and is *very* interested in<br/>contemporary music (he composes wild stuff himself!) would have<br/>thought that performing in 31-equal could possibly &quot;ruin&quot; his<br/>playing!  I never would have thought about that...</p><p>Now, someone might ask, why *do* you want to know about that... :)<br/>Well, quite frankly, it leads me to be more careful in my approach,<br/>or, at least, in my *salesmanship* of the microtonal works.</p><p>It seems to me, and, Jon, you are actually concurring in this with<br/>many of your statements, that for many players microtonality is a<br/>particular &quot;challenge&quot; perhaps even a &quot;bother!&quot;  In order to get<br/>these people interested, there needs to be a certain salesmanship,<br/>and a careful approach.  THAT&apos;S what I want to learn in this process.</p><p>I&apos;m really not so interested in having the same players play the<br/>music over and over again.  Sure, that might help *my* career, and I<br/>*will* do that to an extent, but I&apos;m also interested in trying to<br/>figure out how to expand the microtonal COMMUNITY.</p><p>I can see, in order to do this, I have to take a *very careful*<br/>approach....</p><p>Maybe I should hire an advertising firm...  :)</p><p>&gt;<br/>&gt; 3. What about some of the killer &apos;rising star&apos; players at the<br/>better Institutions of Higher Learning (Music-type) in the area? Gad,<br/>conservatism rules these days, but (hopefully) youth is still more<br/>willing to take risk than old farts. That&apos;s how it works with<br/>skateboards.<br/>&gt;</p><p>***Yes, but occasionally they will forget to wear their helmets and<br/>then they &quot;brain&quot; themselves on the nearest tree...</p><p>Dunno... Otto Luening was 95 years old and was teaching us<br/>about &quot;totalism&quot;... We&apos;d never heard of it.  And, I believe Partch<br/>was quite adventurous during *every* time of his life, although I<br/>will defer to *you* on that one.  Kind of depends on the person.</p><p>The point is that UNCLE JOSEPH WANTS *YOU* *YOU* *YOU* to join the<br/>microtonal revolution, and in order to do that, we have to approach<br/>things in a certain way.  I just don&apos;t want to see but a handful of<br/>players doing this.</p><p>&gt; 4. I wasn&apos;t kidding about the recordings - maybe you need to<br/>completely alter the way you present the works! What if, instead of<br/>saying &quot;I&apos;d like you to play this piece of mine in 72 divisions of<br/>the octave...&quot;, you said &quot;what do you think of this?&quot; and popped a CD<br/>in the player (CD player, not cello player) and checked the reaction.<br/>&gt;</p><p>***Yes, I&apos;ve been tempted to shove the CD there, but let&apos;s not<br/>continue along that &quot;track...&quot;</p><p>However, saying the piece was in 72 equal right off the bat was<br/>a &quot;baddie boo...&quot;  That turned him off right away, with protests.<br/>OHMYGOD, he probably thought he&apos;d see all kinds of unfamiliar<br/>hieroglyphics on the page.</p><p>Actually, he *will* be seeing all kinds of unfamiliar hieroglyphics<br/>on the page:  the Sims notation.  That&apos;s one reason that Johnny<br/>Reinhard is unenthusiastic about it.  Perhaps he is right there...we<br/>shall see!!!</p><p>Dan mentioned the idea that he&apos;d have to &quot;learn a different<br/>vocabulary...&quot;  which he *will* to a degree.  However, when I<br/>mentioned there really are only THREE microtones and the system is<br/>based on a *foundation* of 12-equal, it seemed to settle him down a<br/>bit...</p><p>&gt; It is ultimately going to have to - Have To - be the music that<br/>wins over anyone, performer and listener alike. Unless you are<br/>planning on becoming independently wealthy, you aren&apos;t going to be<br/>able to pay so much that you are actually &apos;bribing&apos; people! They are<br/>going to have to get so caught up in the music itself that they will<br/>*ask* to play it.<br/>&gt;</p><p>***Yeppir, and if I had to *pay* them big money, and even *had* it,<br/>it would be very &quot;faux...&quot;  A &quot;vanity&quot; activity.  No, you&apos;re right,<br/>they have to come of this themselves...</p><p>&gt; Everyone is biddy. Everyone gots too much toodoo. You won&apos;t be able<br/>to twist arms, it is going to have to be near-irresistable to them,<br/>and they won&apos;t do it just for the challenge. I really think that,<br/>judging from the player comments like take &quot;working with 31 equal and<br/>stuff like that can f*ck up your playing!&quot;, you aren&apos;t reaching the<br/>right people.</p><p>***Well, Jon, I have to assure you that Dan Barrett *is* a &quot;right<br/>person.&quot;  That is what makes this &quot;special case&quot; so interesting!  I<br/>wonder what went on, and what experiences he had with microtonal<br/>pieces that would lead him to that conclusion...</p><p>Let me guess:  somebody gave him an absolutely *impossible* 31-equal<br/>piece to work on, he never really got it, the composer was never<br/>really satisfied, and the system was *so* different for him than 12<br/>that it was totally disorienting...  That&apos;s a guess..</p><p>&gt;<br/>&gt; I&apos;m wishing you the best, and hoping your music finds it&apos;s<br/>performance voice.</p><p>***Thanks for the good wishes, Jon!  Actually, I&apos;m not despairing at<br/>all!  I feel more like a *sociologist* just trying to find out what<br/>*really is out there!*</p><p>I mean, I can always write in 12-equal if I have to, but I don&apos;t<br/>think it will come to that.  I think it&apos;s all in how we *approach*<br/>certain players.  Your idea of the carrot rather than the &quot;stick<br/>it&quot;... or a nice *recording* of a great microtonal piece, and maybe a<br/>little &quot;rah rah&quot; might do the trick.  We really don&apos;t want to have to<br/>go Madison Avenue... :)</p><p>&gt;<br/>&gt; Best,<br/>&gt; Jon<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; (...who just came home from Tower with a CD entitled &quot;Another<br/>Coast: New Works from the West&quot; [Dresher, Stone, Payne, DeMarinis]...)</p><p>***Well, I haven&apos;t really spent enough time on the West Coast to know<br/>if there really is a difference in player attitudes among the<br/>professionals.  Aside from the people who are *especially* interested<br/>in Asian and other &quot;exotic&quot; kinds of music, I wonder what the<br/>more &quot;straight ahead&quot; pros would think of systems like 72-tET, etc.</p><p>My guess is they would have the same reaction as people on *this*<br/>coast... in other words, they might be interested if the product is<br/>*presented* in the right way...</p><p>This investigation will continue...  :)</p><p>It rather looks like Dan Barrett will play the piece, despite the<br/>initial protests.  I&apos;m only hoping that he *will* and that his<br/>encounter with microtonality through this piece will be a *joyous*<br/>experience that he will want to repeat!</p><p>Joe</p></div><h3><a id=39636 href="#39636">ðŸ”—</a>Afmmjr@aol.com</h3><span>10/15/2002 9:49:30 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>In a message dated 10/15/02 11:39:50 PM Eastern Daylight Time,<br/><a href="mailto:jpehrson@rcn.com">jpehrson@rcn.com</a> writes:</p><p>&gt; It rather looks like Dan Barrett will play the piece, despite the<br/>&gt; initial protests.

His quartertones are beyond<br/>reproach.  His experience playing &quot;Natural Coos&quot; by Winifred Keane was<br/>certainly volatile (as in personality conflict with the composer...both from<br/>the same town in Connecticut).</p><p>The 4/15/94 AFMM concert he played had different sections in different<br/>tunings, including 19-tET, eighthtones, Vallotti, Kirnberger, and<br/>quarter-comma meantone.  His reaction to you was likely partly your delivery<br/>(starting with saying there are 72 tones per octave when there are many<br/>less).  His performance was great, regardless of rehearsal friction, and the<br/>piece came out as an independent CD by the composer.  He played great and he<br/>was paid adequately.</p><p>It is also true that Danny has had a history of back problems and posture<br/>problems with the cello.  He went through a torturous reeducation to play as<br/>well as he does now.  We used to hang back when I was at Manhattan School of<br/>Music, and even before that.  Basically, players say something to disarm you<br/>when you shock them with something (72 tones)! So that they calculate if it<br/>is worth their while.  Danny already plays microtonally...reading cents<br/>notation, by the way.  He is not a candidate to convert, in other ways.</p><p>And frankly, Jon, I&apos;m not sure there is a single cellist that could play<br/>72-tET on the West coast...do you know of any?
