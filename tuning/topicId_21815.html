I wanted to<br/>restrict myself to only seven pitches and get inside the scale. So,<br/>because of the nature of the piece I had in mind, I sang through a few<br/>of the more singable tetrachord based scales and chose the &apos;Phrygian&apos;<br/>sounding Ptolemy&apos;s Malakon or soft Diatonic which lays out as follows:-</p><p>                1/1           21/20           7/6<br/>4/3           3/2           63/40           7/4           2/1</p><p> Cents      0              84.47         266.87      498.04<br/>701.96      786.42       968.83      1200</p><p>Steps between a la John Chalmers:-</p><p>            (21/20)          (10/9)        (8/7)         (9/8)<br/>(21/20)        (10/9)        (8/7)</p><p>Cents    84.47            182.4       231.17      203.91<br/>84.47          182.4       231.17</p><p>There are interesting compositional challenges with this scale as<br/>regards harmony if you want a variety of consonant vertical structures<br/>and counterpoint. I chose to use modal techniques and simple dronal and<br/>contrapuntal methods to achieve my objectives. Then I wrote and scored<br/>out my piece for harp, marimba and organ, though it would sound fine for<br/>other combinations, perhaps strings.</p><p>It was suggested by Paul that I look at realising the piece in 22 tet<br/>which I&apos;ve managed to find time to do. I&apos;ve been pleased to find a<br/>satisfying cross-learning process going on as I&apos;ve looked at how close<br/>22 tet comes to Ptolemy&apos;s scale, then at other 22 tet choices and then<br/>at other Just Intonation choices.</p><p>Going by ear and using a 22 tet guitar, my first choice of steps was</p><p>                0            2            5            9<br/>13            15            18            22</p><p>Cents       0        109.09     272.73   490.91     709.09     818.18<br/>981.82    1200</p><p>Steps 9 and 13 are about - and + 7.14 cents from the just 4/3 and 3/2<br/>respectively. There&apos;s not much I can do about this and besides the<br/>exotic fifths and fourths gives different temperaments their<br/>individuality. Step 5 is 5.86 cents sharp of the septimal minor third<br/>7/6 (sensuous interval BTW) which is good to my ears. Step 18 is nearly<br/>13 cents sharp of the harmonic seventh 7/4, not quite satisfactory to my<br/>ears.</p><p>The two remaining steps, 2 and 15 are substantially off the mark. Step 2<br/>is 24.6 cents sharp of 21/20 and step 15 is 31.8 cents sharp of 63/40<br/>which is just TOO MUCH. Must make a note to do some ear training.</p><p>Replacing step 2 with step 1 ( 54.55 cents) isn&apos;t much better. This puts<br/>me nearly 30 cents flat of 21/20. Replacing step 15 with step 14<br/>(763.64 cents) puts me nearly 23 cents flat of 63/40. The just pitches<br/>lie pretty much in between the 22 tet steps. But the upside of this is<br/>that I now have four  22 tet seven note scales to experiment with as I<br/>try to arrange my original piece for guitar. These are:-</p><p>0    2    5    9    13    15    18    22   my original approximation<br/>0    2    5    9    13    14    18    22<br/>0    1    5    9    13    15    18    22<br/>0    1    5    9    13    14    18    22</p><p>The last of these I find to be of considerable melodic interest.<br/>Possible uses for these  could be the use of different variants<br/>ascending and descending in fixed passages or as improvisational choices<br/>in freer passages. Both possibilities present themselves in my original<br/>JI piece.</p><p>Looking back from my new 22 tet variables to close JI pitches I find<br/>that step 1 is only 1.28 cents sharp of 33/32 (11 limit and very sexy).<br/>Step 2 is only 2.64 cents flat of 16/15, an eminently singable tone.<br/>Step 14 is 1.28 cents flat of 14/9 and step 15 is 4.49 cents sharp of<br/>14/9. These are accurate representations. Although I haven&apos;t done this<br/>yet, I intend to explore some of the new JI tetrachords that these<br/>pitches suggest. A trawl through &quot;Divisions of the Tetrachord&quot; has<br/>proved to be edifying. I reckon they will all be diatonic though upper<br/>and lower tetrachords will obviously differ in some cases.</p><p>One example:-</p><p>1/1    33/32    7/6    4/3    3/2    14/9    7/4    2/1</p><p>Ultimately, the proof of the pudding lies in the eating. Some of the new<br/>JI scales might stretch the already fragile consonant structures of the<br/>original composition too much. Others might completely transform the<br/>piece.  I hope to get round to putting up sound files of the original in<br/>Ptolemy&apos;s Malakon realised using samples and then the 22 tet guitar<br/>version (or possibly versions) which I haven&apos;t mastered quite yet (pun<br/>intended).</p><p>Comments (and corrections) welcome.</p><p>Best Wishes</p></div><h3>paul@stretch-music.com</h3><span>4/29/2001 12:49:33 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In tuning@y..., Alison Monteith &lt;alison.monteith3@w...&gt; wrote:</p><p>&gt; Replacing step 2 with step 1 ( 54.55 cents) isn&apos;t much better.
