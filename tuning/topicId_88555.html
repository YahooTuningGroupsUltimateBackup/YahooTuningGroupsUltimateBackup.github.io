Something like<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; <a href="http://x31eq.com/catalog.htm">http://x31eq.com/catalog.htm</a><br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; only much bigger?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; That would be the temperament list Jaques wanted. Otherwise, I can &gt; dig out some tuning-math postings.</p><p>Just a thought about one item in this catalog - &quot;Golden non-meantone&quot; seems a complicated and confusing name to me.<br/>We know certainly what &quot;Golden meantone&quot; refers to, after Joseph Yasser, Thorvald Kornerup, and myself who was completly ignorant of the precedent works from these searchers (and so was Johnny Reinhard apparently when he published my article on &quot;The Golden scale&quot;, or he would have told me).<br/>I haven&apos;t read the Xenharmonikon#15 article, but the description here mentions &quot;Phi as the period, and a generator of 2/1&quot;, which is interesting (BTW would not it be the same as a generator of sqrt of 5 - 1  ~1.236 then ?,  the octave- complement of Phi, that I also use as a generator I call &quot;Iph&quot;), anyway it uses Phi on the frequency level, while in the so-called &quot;Golden meantone&quot; (what I define as a meta-temperament), Phi is used only on the logarithmic level.<br/>I have no idea what a better name would be but it is a &quot;Phiave&quot; temperament and perhaps the article if someone has it, or Walter O&apos;Connell himself could give more indications ?<br/>- - - - - - - -<br/>Jacques</p></div><h3>Graham Breed &#x3C;gbreed@...&#x3E;</h3><span>5/1/2010 4:47:24 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>On 1 May 2010 14:38, Jacques Dudon &lt;fotosonix@...&gt; wrote:</p><p>&gt; Just a thought about one item in this catalog - &quot;Golden non-meantone&quot;<br/>&gt; seems a complicated and confusing name to me.</p><p>Yes, it&apos;s not a name, just a heading.

I saw &quot;Miracle, Magic, Orwell, Porcupine, etc.&quot; and thought it was also a name...<br/>Just a general and personal thought only, about &quot;Golden&quot; : the term is used in architecture, visual arts etc. (&quot;Golden proportion&quot;) and fits well, to my sense, to logarithmic proportions (of intervals). &quot;Phi-based&quot;, as an alternative, would apply better for 1.618, Fibonaccis, etc. in the frequency domain.<br/>Golden scales = logarithmic<br/>Phi-based scales = frequency ratios<br/>?<br/>- - - - - - -<br/>Jacques</p></div>
