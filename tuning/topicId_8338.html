I converted the MP3 to WAV.  The<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt; error range is +/- 1.3 hertz.  I have included the frequency range as the<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt; software does not identify precise frequencies.  The first column indicates<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt; the frequency obtained at the center of each band.  I attenuated the<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt; amplitude of the sample to narrow the frequency band.<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt; Frequency    Range            Atttenuation<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt; 262 htz           259-267             9 dec                   cant<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt; 337                332-340              18 dec                 by<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt; 405                402-407             18 dec                   me<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt; Looks like that third very close to 9/7!  If anyone doubts the analysis, I<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt; will send screen shots justifying the frequencies I chose.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Wim Hoogewerf responded:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt; Darren: my compliments for what seems to be a very precize analysis. I did<br/>&gt;&gt; some strumming and singing, like Joe, with the record in my mind, but I<br/>&gt;&gt; still didn&apos;t hear the E as being higher than usual. It felt more as if the C<br/>&gt;&gt; was much lower.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Wim, I&apos;m interested in your analysis, but I have a few questions. Since the<br/>&gt; issue has to do with the intervalic relationship of C and E, how is C being<br/>&gt; lower different from E being higher? C is lower is relation to what, if not<br/>&gt; to E? Apparently, you agree that the interval is wider than &quot;normal.&quot; Right?<br/>I considered E and G being in tune with  the fixed pitch instruments like<br/>the guitar, strumming the E-minor chord immediatel after the first three<br/>notes. So that&apos;s why I felt the C being low. Of course the interval is much<br/>wider than &quot;normal&quot;.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt; In fact the very first chord which comes in after the words<br/>&gt;&gt; &quot;Can&apos;t buy me&quot; in is E minor and not C major.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I don&apos;t see how the chord that follows the phrase could influence the tuning<br/>&gt; of the phrase in question. The end of the verse is solidly in C major, the<br/>&gt; more likely influence on the tuning of the phrase.<br/>I played the E minor chord, than muted the sound, started singing and felt<br/>that the C was attracted towards the B in this chord, almost like a<br/>dissonant note. Is that impossible?<br/>&gt;&gt; The first C (&quot;Can&apos;t&quot;)<br/>&gt;&gt; McCartney sings is may be attracted downwards to the B in the E minor chord<br/>&gt;&gt; that follows. If we tune this C upwards from 262 to 270 Hz the C - E - G<br/>&gt;&gt; triad would be a virtually perfect 4:5:6.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; But what would it be if we don&apos;t move the C? I think that is the issue.</p><p>I thought about that as well, but only after my post. I discovered that the<br/>frequency of the C (262 Hertz), measured by Darren,  was almost exactly the<br/>frequency of the tempered C if the A was 440 Hertz, which we may presume. In<br/>this way of course the C is normal, we do have a very high E and a G about a<br/>quarter tone lower as &quot;normal&quot;. Still there&apos;s not very much to conclude,<br/>since there is no drone C-G.</p><p>I like the subject of measuring the intonation of melodies , especially when<br/>they&apos;re sung by non-classical singers. There should be better examples than<br/>&quot;Can&apos;t buy me love&quot;.</p><p>--Wim</p></div><h3><a id=8339 href="#8339">ðŸ”—</a>Paul H.
