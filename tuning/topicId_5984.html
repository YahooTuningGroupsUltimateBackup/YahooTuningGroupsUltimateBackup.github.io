I think I&apos;ve got it figured out now.</p><p>There are two versions...</p><p>Strong: All instances of a pitch in a scale&apos;s &quot;Cartesian&quot; cross-set occupy<br/>the same scale-degree position in the row or column in which they fall.</p><p>Weak: All pitches appearing in both the original scale and any one of the<br/>transposed scales in the &quot;Cartesian&quot; cross-set occupy the same scale<br/>position in their respective scales.</p><p>The question...</p><p>If [S -TC-&gt; S*f] and [S -TC-&gt; S*g], must [S -TC-&gt; S*(f-g)]?</p><p>Example, S = 1/1 5/4 3/2<br/>If [S -TC-&gt; S*5/4] and [S -TC-&gt; S*3/2], must [S -TC-&gt; S*6/5]?</p><p>...asks if these two versions are actually independent.  Here&apos;s the<br/>&quot;Cartesian cross-set&quot; of the C major scale in 12tET...</p><p>   B   C#  D#  E   F#  G#  A#<br/>   A   B   C#  D   E   F#  G#<br/>   G   A   B   C   D   E   F#<br/>   F   G   A   Bb  C   D   E<br/>   E   F#  G#  A   B   C#  D#<br/>   D   E   F#  G   A   B   C#<br/>   C   D   E   F   G   A   B</p><p>...the &quot;original&quot; scale of C major is TC with all the transposed scales in<br/>the set.  However, the F and B transposed versions are not TC with<br/>eachother.  So the answer to the question above is &quot;NO!&quot;, and the Strong<br/>and Weak versions above really are independent.</p><p>What does this mean?  It means there are scales that are Weak TC in some<br/>modes but not in others.  Why?  Because B does get compared to the original<br/>scale when the cross set of the Lydian mode is taken.  Is anybody following<br/>this?</p><p>Strong TC is by definition a property of all modes.  It is also equivalent<br/>to CS.  I&apos;ve said that before...</p><p>&gt;&gt;It seems to me, if I&apos;ve understood correctly how you&apos;ve defined it, that<br/>&gt;&gt;in most cases it would be most meaninful to consider TC shorthand for<br/>&gt;&gt;&quot;TC by all intervals within the scale itself&quot;.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;You mean only those intervals measured up from the root, or measured from<br/>&gt;anywhere?  If you mean the latter, then your suggested definition is<br/>&gt;equivalent to CS (constant structureness).</p><p>Here&apos;s an outline of my reasoning...</p><p>1. CS means all instances of a pitch in a scale&apos;s &quot;diamondic&quot; cross-set<br/>occupy the same scale position.</p><p>2. Strong TC means all instances of a pitch in a scale&apos;s &quot;Cartesian&quot;<br/>cross-set occupy the same scale position.</p><p>3. Multiplying a scale by n/d changes its accidentals in the same way (but<br/>in opposite directions) as multiplying the scale by d/n.</p><p>4. So making a &quot;Cartesian&quot; cross set makes a &quot;virtual&quot; diamond, which is<br/>equivalent as far as common tones go.</p><p>5. I realized that all strictly proper scales are CS.  Paul Erlich realized<br/>that all strictly proper scales are TC.  That seems to add weight to the<br/>argument.</p><p>Conclusions?  I like Weak TC, because I think it better reflects how this<br/>property works in music.  Although CS now takes on a new level of interest<br/>for me.</p><p>The future?  I&apos;d like to learn which of these properties, if any, all MOS&apos;s<br/>have.  Strong TC / CS is out, since the diatonic scale in 12tET is MOS.<br/>That leaves Weak TC.  After that, I&apos;ll want to return to lattice TC, and<br/>search for periodicity blocks that have it.</p><p>-Carl</p></div><h3><a id=5996 href="#5996">ðŸ”—</a>Carl Lumma &#x3C;clumma@xxx.xxxx&#x3E;</h3><span>11/7/1999 7:45:09 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>&gt;It&apos;s sounds like you&apos;re retreading -- albeit in a generalized way -- much of<br/>&gt;good old fashioned twelve-tone theory.

The answer<br/>is no, since the far left column _is_ TC with all the others, and the columns<br/>starting on F and B are not TC with eachother.  So we have two seperate<br/>measures, Weak and Strong.  This is trivial, and I gather you understood it.</p><p>It is also trivial that the Weak version varies across the modes of a scale,<br/>since the column starting on F would be in the far left if the cross set of<br/>the lydian mode had been taken instead of the ionion.

Weak TC= No ambiguous intervals between a mode and its transpositions?</p><p>Was there an error in my reasoning that 1 &amp; 2 are the same?</p><p>I asked if all MOS&apos;s have at least one mode that is Weak TC.  That&apos;s the<br/>same as asking if no MOS has at least one ambiguous interval appearance in<br/>every mode.  Last year on November 19th I had asked if any proper scale<br/>could have this property.  I answered the question affirmatively on<br/>December 29th, and the example I gave had Myhill&apos;s property...</p><p>       C   Eb   Gb<br/>2nds   3    3   *6<br/>3rds  *6   *6    9<br/>4ths  12   12   12</p><p>...so it seems not all MOS&apos;s have at least one Weak TC mode.  However, this<br/>is a fairly degenerate case -- the generator has not yet spanned the IE.

Am I following you so<br/>&gt;far?</p><p>Yes, except that TC has always been a relation between two absolute pitch<br/>sets.  First there was lattice TC, where a set of connected lattice points<br/>could be transposed by any one of the intervals connecting it without any of<br/>the (absolute pitch) common tones between the original and tranposed scales<br/>changing scale positions.  Last I remember, we had decided that if you add<br/>connectedness to your search criteria, then lattice TC was basically a weaker<br/>version of your search -- which hardly seemed desirable.</p><p>So I proposed a version where the scale -- connected or not -- could be<br/>rooted on any one of its members without having common tones jump scale<br/>positions.  I called this self TC.  There are two versions: weak and strong.<br/>Weak means you can take a scale and root it on any of its members without<br/>getting ambigous intervals between the two scales.  Say you&apos;re playing along<br/>in Cmaj -- you can switch to Fmaj without a hangup.  You can&apos;t switch to F#<br/>without a hangup, but you&apos;d never think of switching to F# because there<br/>isn&apos;t one in the current scale.  You can switch to D first -- then you&apos;ll<br/>have an F# -- but each of the switches will be cool.</p><p>Strong TC says, &quot;I&apos;m going to be perverse, and demand that TC hold over more<br/>than single depth of switch.  It has to hold from C thru D to F#.  Because a<br/>listener could still have C in his mind when F# comes around.&quot;</p><p>&gt;What would be different if you took the cross set of the lydian mode?</p><p>A single transposition could turn up an ambiguity.</p><p>&gt;&gt;It is also trivial that the Weak version varies across the modes of a<br/>&gt;&gt;scale, since the column starting on F would be in the far left if the<br/>&gt;&gt;cross set of the lydian mode had been taken instead of the ionion.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;But that is not all that would change:</p><p>Yikes!</p><p>&gt;&gt;Different only up to a transposition, which shouldn&apos;t matter.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;I already explained that. If you followed that explanation, you&apos;d know that<br/>&gt;the Cartesian square of the C major scale, which you showed above, is<br/>&gt;identical to the Cartesian square of the Bb lydian mode, provided you rotate<br/>&gt;the numbering of the rows and columns:</p><p>Obviously the relations in the cross set stay the same, which is why Strong<br/>TC is defined for scales, not modes.  So Bb Lydian isn&apos;t Strong TC either --<br/>no mode of the major scale is.  Nor is Bb Lydian Weak TC, as Bb Ionion and C<br/>Ionion are.</p><p>Hopefully all this is clear by now.  I feel like a bit of an ass -- I&apos;ve<br/>managed to confuse everyone here, starting with myself -- over something<br/>rather unremarkable.</p><p>Clearly the missing ingredient in all these TC&apos;s is attention to the<br/>proportion of common tones under transposition.  So basically, what it boils<br/>down to is: &quot;Paul, you could narrow your search by insisting that the<br/>periodicity blocks be connected on the triangular lattice, and that<br/>transposition by at least one of the connecting intervals gives a scale with<br/>many common tones.&quot;</p><p>I&apos;m fairly certain that such a search would find scales with high Rothenberg<br/>efficiency.</p><p>-Carl</p></div><h3><a id=6121 href="#6121">ðŸ”—</a>Paul H.
