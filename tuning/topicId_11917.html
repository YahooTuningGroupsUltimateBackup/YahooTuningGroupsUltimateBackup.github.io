At<br/>the end of the piece, the same passage is played, however the<br/>tuning has been &apos;morphed&apos; to a normal meantone, so that the<br/>thirds are now consonant.</p><p>Something like a Crab Canon would be a nice fit here, as<br/>the begininng section would emphasise the thirds and sixths<br/>resolving to fourths and fifths, while the ending could<br/>emphasise the fourths and fifths (now a bit unpure) resolving<br/>to consonant thirds and sixths.</p><p>Whether such a strong formal plan as &apos;crab cannon&apos; was used, it<br/>looks like an ABA&apos; form is a natural, with the emphasis mentioned<br/>above. The middle section (in the center of the morph), will be<br/>alot like 12tet, since the flats and sharps have to reverse their<br/>orientation and would cross (become synonymous) here.</p><p>Using gigantic temperments may be a good strategy for for<br/>approaching the morph in discreet steps. Whether the final<br/>composition morphs discretely or continuously...</p><p>for instance, in 310tet, the following diatonic systems are<br/>some of those available. [L and s stepsizes, then cents<br/>values for a few important intervals]</p><p>L    s     M2    M3      P5<br/>58   10    225   449     712<br/>56   15    217   434     708<br/>54   20    209   418     705<br/>52   25    201   403     701<br/>50   30    194   387     697<br/>48   35    186   372     693<br/>46   40    178   356     689</p><p>323tet is interesting, providing the morph from 17 to 19 tet,<br/>however, going to 646tet gives an even better morph from 17<br/>to better than 31.</p><p>M2&#x9;M3&#x9;P5<br/>212&#x9;424&#x9;706        this is 17<br/>208&#x9;416&#x9;704<br/>204&#x9;409&#x9;702<br/>201&#x9;401&#x9;700<br/>197&#x9;394&#x9;698<br/>193&#x9;386&#x9;697        L=104 s=63 [105,63 is 31tet]<br/>189&#x9;379&#x9;695        this is 19</p><p>Bob Valentine</p></div>
