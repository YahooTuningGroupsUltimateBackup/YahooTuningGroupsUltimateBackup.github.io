I&apos;m putting together a simple webpage and wanted to place<br/>a link to the xenharmonic websites that are out there. Of course, I don&apos;t<br/>expect to catch them all; there are local experimental music groups all over<br/>the country, not to mention musical traditions all over the world. It seems<br/>like the Microtonal Listening List (also called the Composers&apos; Websites)<br/>page could be combined with the People page, and, when available, a website<br/>could be listed alongside a person. That way all the names, websites, and<br/>personal descriptions would be in one place, and could be edited in a single<br/>place. A separate listening list page might follow a more chronological<br/>progression of &quot;important&quot; works, e.g. Vincentino-&gt;..-&gt;Blackwood-&gt;...</p><p>That said, I sure would like to take you up on your offer to help get us<br/>novices up to speed on this, and definitely don&apos;t mind if we continue the<br/>discussion that way! I feel like part of this is my fault; I just haven&apos;t<br/>had much time in my schedule to work through some of Gene&apos;s ideas,<br/>especially when it comes to pretty much any of the matrix math. When I do<br/>get a little time, I wind up working on some of my own notions and improving<br/>my codebase, and am still short on time for that.</p><p>A possible approach for a Tutorial page might be to come up with a really<br/>good example problem, one that requires many typically important descriptive<br/>and operational concepts to work through, like eigenmonzos, etc., but which<br/>is not terribly difficult. It would also be nice if the result produces<br/>something that sounds interesting. As for tuning set theory and monsters<br/>etc, I don&apos;t know where to begin on that; it maybe a Tutorial page best left<br/>for another day (or decade).</p><p>I&apos;m sure the archives are full of good problems, but I don&apos;t know how to<br/>identify them.</p><p>Dan N</p><p>On Sat, Jun 18, 2011 at 5:06 AM, Mike Battaglia &lt;battaglia01@...&gt;wrote:</p><p>&gt; **<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; On Sat, Jun 18, 2011 at 1:30 AM, Daniel Nielsen &lt;nielsed@...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; I am looking for a single page or web ring that will offer pretty much<br/>&gt; all the online resources of the xenharmonic community, whether established<br/>&gt; or lay person.
