Every direct<br/>connection in my lattices is a consonant interval that _is_ audibly more<br/>consonant than the other, non-directly-connected intervals in the tuning or<br/>temperament in question. Does that answer your confusion? If not, perhaps<br/>you could point to a specific example?</p></div>
