Fauxbourdon, fabourdon, falsabordone etc. are variants.</p><p>&gt; &gt; Can you point me to a (preferably online) reference giving more &gt; detail about the character and practice of &quot;fauxburdon&quot; as &gt; &quot;a semi-improvised form of polyphony&quot;?<br/>&gt; try the New Grove, but if you read German, here&apos;s a quick summary:</p><p><a href="http://www.klassik-heute.de/lexikon/lexikon_fauxbourdon.shtml">http://www.klassik-heute.de/lexikon/lexikon_fauxbourdon.shtml</a></p><p>&gt; BTW:  &quot;Islamdom&quot; ???
