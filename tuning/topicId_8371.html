Schulter &#x3C;mschulter@value.net&#x3E;</h3><span>2/8/2000 1:56:24 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Hello, there, and I&apos;d like to comment on the question of European<br/>music history and especially its intonational side in connection with<br/>matters of spirituality and religious movements. Generally I would<br/>agree with Daniel Wolf that we should be careful about making<br/>generalizations in this area.</p><p>At the same time, of course, I would agree with Joe Monzo that<br/>developments such as the 12th-century Renaissance and the introduction<br/>of Islamic culture and learning (including some Greek sources) to<br/>Europe in that epic may interact with musical developments in some<br/>very interesting ways.</p><p>In approaching both these points, I would like to suggest another<br/>caution: it may be important not to underestimate the influence of<br/>musical and stylistic logic both on shifting choices in tuning<br/>systems, and on the metaphors (theological or otherwise) used to<br/>express music practice and theory.</p><p>For example, the Continental European styles of the era around<br/>1200-1420 can be explained and appreciated in purely musical terms:<br/>they represent some very successful and pleasing approaches to<br/>creating beautiful music based on fifths and fourths as richly stable<br/>intervals. Many other cultures on various continents also create such<br/>music following often very different styles and theoretical<br/>frameworks. In England during this same era, however, some musical<br/>styles preferred thirds as the most favored intervals -- as also<br/>occurs in various other world polyphonies.</p><p>Having emphasized in many articles the ways in which Pythagorean or<br/>3-limit just intonation fits medieval European polyphony based on<br/>stable fifths and fourths, I should add that nevertheless the music<br/>has its own style and logic which I can hear also in 12-tet, 1/4-comma<br/>meantone, 17-tet, etc. In appreciating how these intonational shadings<br/>can affect this music, we should not underestimate the importance of<br/>categorical perception of intervals.</p><p>Thus Perotin or Machaut ending on a sonority including a third, or<br/>Mozart ending on a sonority including a seventh, &quot;sounds wrong&quot; or out<br/>of style -- whether the third is 5:4, 400 cents, 81:64, or 9:7; and<br/>likewise whether the seventh is 7:4, 1000 cents, or 16:9, etc. While<br/>one can certainly say that the tuning systems of these eras reflect<br/>and reinforce style, I would consider it much more questionable to<br/>conclude that these systems _dictate_ style. When styles change, the<br/>systems can change also.</p><p>Returning to the question of religion and intonational systems in<br/>early modern Europe, I would like consider some developments in both<br/>Catholic and Protestant regions which may support Daniel Wolf&apos;s<br/>caution about generalizations.</p><p>For example, it is in 1511, before Luther&apos;s Reformation becomes a<br/>factor, that the German theorist Arnold Schlick proposes a kind of<br/>&quot;well-temperament&quot; not for the entire keyboard, but for one note in<br/>what Mark Lindley describes as a meantone tuning at around 1/5-comma:<br/>Ab/G#.</p><p>Finding Ab too useful a note to miss, but recognizing that G# occurs<br/>in lots of cadential passages, Schlick suggests the compromise on a<br/>12-note keyboard of tuning a high but tolerable Ab which can also<br/>serve as a marginal G# in quick passages. If we assume with Lindley<br/>that Schlick&apos;s regular major thirds are a bit larger than pure, then<br/>the diesis in this tuning might be around 30 cents -- so that Ab-C<br/>might be tuned about 10 cents wide, and E-G# about 20 cents wide<br/>(near-Pythagorean).</p><p>Later in the century, it is the Catholic Nicola Vicentino (1555) who<br/>builds the archicembalo and arciorgano for &quot;enharmonic&quot; or fifthtone<br/>music with a near-equal 31-note meantone division of the octave, as<br/>well as for 5-limit just intonation of a variety which Paul Erlich has<br/>aptly described as &quot;adaptive.&quot;</p><p>Interestingly, Cardinal Carlo Borromeo of Milan remarked that<br/>Vicentino would be welcome to compose a chromatic Mass as one approach<br/>to &quot;intelligible music&quot; -- that is, music where the text could be<br/>readily understood by listeners.</p><p>As it happens, another Catholic composer, Anthoine de Bertrand (1578),<br/>used Vicentinan dieses in an enharmonic chanson: like his Protestant<br/>counterpart Claude Goudimel, another great French musician of the era,<br/>he was assassinated in the course of the terrible civil wars of<br/>religion then ravishing France.</p><p>Despite the all too well known religious hatreds and persecutions of<br/>the 16th and 17th centuries, musical ideas _did_ travel across<br/>boundaries. Thus even while England was executing Catholics as<br/>&quot;traitors,&quot; and the Venetian Inquisition was drowning Protestants, the<br/>Italian madrigal and canzonetta &quot;invaded&quot; England and led to the<br/>English Madrigal School of late Elizabethan and Jacobean times.</p><p>Here my purpose is not to minimize the contributions of either<br/>Protestant or Catholic musicians to intonational and other<br/>developments, but only to respond to the possible assumption that<br/>either religious tradition was incompatible with musical innovation.</p><p>When the Lutheran writer Johannes Lippius (1610, 1612) wrote his<br/>musical synopsis centered on the _trias harmonica_ (triad) as a<br/>keystone of theology and musical practice alike, he drew on Catholic<br/>models in the areas of intonational theory and composition. Thus he<br/>shares Zarlino&apos;s enthusiasm for Ptolemy&apos;s syntonic diatonic tuning as<br/>applied to tertian or 5-limit music, and recommends as models of<br/>practice Luca Marenzio and Orlando di Lasso.</p><p>During this same era, the Lutheran composer Heinrich Schutz studied in<br/>Venice with Giovanni Gabrieli and adapted a song by Claudio Monteverdi<br/>for one of his own pieces, also introducing elements of the new<br/>&quot;concerted&quot; Italian styles into his German music. When Praetorius<br/>championed 1/4-comma meantone -- known to some later theorists as the<br/>&quot;Praetorian&quot; tuning -- he was likely sharing a preference widespread<br/>in Italy also.</p><p>Earlier, as reported in his treatise of 1581, Vincenzo Galilei had<br/>experimented with the usual temperament for a lute -- 12-tet or a<br/>close approximation -- on a harpsichord. He found it &quot;insupportable&quot;<br/>for such a timbre, although in principle he considered the tuning with<br/>equal semitones as more symmetrical and &quot;perfect,&quot; and wrote a piece<br/>assuming the equivalency of accidentals such as G# and Ab to<br/>demonstrate what he considered its unique advantages.</p><p>Moving to the topic of well-temperaments (i.e. 12-note circulating<br/>temperaments, equal or otherwise), with the caution that this is<br/>going beyond my historical range of familiarity, I might note that<br/>Mark Lindley offers some evidence that Frescobaldi favored 12-tet in<br/>the 1630&apos;s, and suggests that this composer&apos;s pupil Froberger wrote<br/>works which may best be performed in this tuning. Here, again, an<br/>intonational preference may have travelled from Italy to Germany -- if<br/>Lindley&apos;s hypothesis about Frescobaldi and Froberger is valid. (One<br/>note to a piece by Froberger, which does not mention his Protestant or<br/>Catholic affiliation, mentions the influence of French lutenists --<br/>who presumably used an approximation of 12-tet.)</p><p>Also, Lindley notes that by the later 17th century, somewhat before<br/>Werckmeister&apos;s publications (starting in 1681) I take it, French<br/>musicians had developed a kind of unequal temperament called<br/>_ordinaire_, likely as a fortuitous but successful modification of<br/>meantone. Misunderstanding the usual meantone instructions for<br/>tempering fifths at the flat and sharp ends of the tuning chain,<br/>tuners sometimes did this tempering in the &quot;wrong&quot; direction -- and<br/>produced some fifths slightly _wider_ than just, thus by indirection<br/>dodging any Wolves.</p><p>While musicians of the later 17th century in both Protestant and<br/>Catholic regions of Europe were moving from the modal system to<br/>major/minor key tonality, one could argue that it was actually Italy<br/>in the vanguard, with Corelli (c. 1680) providing one popular starting<br/>point for the &quot;common practice period.&quot;</p><p>Of course, Werckmeister deserves a special place of pride in the<br/>history of the well-temperaments, but we should not forget Vallotti,<br/>whose approach to well-temperament has been considered as influential<br/>for the era of Mozart.</p><p>We might also note that Rameau, who I&apos;ve heard was favorably inclined<br/>toward 12-tet, championed the major/minor system as a more<br/>thoroughgoing standard, while Kirnberger in 1771 devoted a portion of<br/>his treatise to the techniques and virtues of the older modal system.<br/>Here my purpose is not to argue the merits of either approach, but<br/>only to support Daniel Wolf&apos;s caution regarding generalizations about<br/>trends in Catholic or Protestant regions of Europe.</p><p>Most respectfully,</p><p>Margo Schulter<br/><a href="mailto:mschulter@value.net">mschulter@value.net</a></p></div><h3><a id=8389 href="#8389">ðŸ”—</a>Joe Monzo &#x3C;monz@juno.com&#x3E;</h3><span>2/9/2000 1:56:33 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>&gt; [Margo Schulter, TD 523.19]<br/>&gt; ... it may be important not to underestimate the influence of<br/>&gt; musical and stylistic logic both on shifting choices in tuning<br/>&gt; systems, and on the metaphors (theological or otherwise) used to<br/>&gt; express music practice and theory.</p><p>Agreed.</p><p>&gt; In England during this same era, however, some musical<br/>&gt; styles preferred thirds as the most favored intervals -- as<br/>&gt; also occurs in various other world polyphonies.</p><p>Those interested in this point may like to read an old post<br/>where I responded to Margo, and in which I speculated wildly<br/>that the 5-limit intonational paradigm may have entered<br/>England via undocumented Scandinavian sources, and that the<br/>Scandinavians may have gotten it from Native Americans c 1000 AD.<br/>See TD 207<br/><a href="http://www.onelist.com/messages/tuning?archive=207">http://www.onelist.com/messages/tuning?archive=207</a><br/>message 14, and Margo&apos;s responses in messages 21 and 22;<br/>the thread continues in Margo absorbing reply in 209.19, and<br/>my response to her in 210.15.</p><p>&gt; In appreciating how these intonational shadings can affect<br/>&gt; this music, we should not underestimate the importance of<br/>&gt; categorical perception of intervals.</p><p>Agreed.</p><p>&gt; While one can certainly say that the tuning systems of these<br/>&gt; eras reflect and reinforce style, I would consider it much more<br/>&gt; questionable to conclude that these systems _dictate_ style.<br/>&gt; When styles change, the systems can change also.</p><p>I think it&apos;s reasonable to conclude that it may work both ways.</p><p>&gt; Returning to the question of religion and intonational systems<br/>&gt; in early modern Europe, I would like consider some developments<br/>&gt; in both Catholic and Protestant regions which may support Daniel<br/>&gt; Wolf&apos;s caution about generalizations.</p><p>And I think your examples make your (and Mr. Wolf&apos;s) point well.</p><p>But I think your examples underline the fact that the Greek<br/>scholars fleeing Constantinople settled mainly in Italy.  Don&apos;t<br/>forget that 2 centuries before Schlick, Vicentino and Zarlino,<br/>Marchetto was active in Italy, and whether he was describing an<br/>extended Pythagorean tuning or some other system (*this* jury is<br/>still out on that question), he was most definitely describing<br/>microtonal subtleties in a system of more than 12 distinct notes<br/>per &apos;octave&apos;.
