Scales with this property are called ---&quot;distributionally even&quot;; related terms include &quot;moments of symmetry&quot; ---(MOS) and &quot;Myhill&apos;s property&quot;.<br/>&nbsp; Hmm...this seems to denote a possible pattern that the most consonant ET scales are also MOS scales.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Come to think of it, I could swear I read an article about the best ET tunings&apos; being defined by primes in the fibonacci series IE 5,7,12,19,31...ET (see <a href="http://www.bikexprt.com/tunings/fibonaci.htm">http://www.bikexprt.com/tunings/fibonaci.htm</a>).&nbsp; Bizarrely enough, my PHITER scale is also formed form MOS intervals, despite having the tuning it is based on being generated using the irrational ratio PHI.<br/>&nbsp; I&apos;m not saying making a scale under MOS tuning is the only way to make a scale under a tuning sound good...but, in general, MOS tunings do seem to tend to sound good.<br/>***********************************************************************<br/>---For example, the usual 5-limit interpretation of 12-note equal<br/>---temperament (12-ET), the &quot;nearest prime mapping&quot; as it is called, can<br/>---be represented as &lt;12, 19, 28], where 12 is the number of steps to<br/>---approximate 2:1, 19 is the number of steps to approximate 3:1, and ---28<br/>is the number of steps to approximate 5:1<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp; So it takes 12 steps in 12TET to get to the octave, 19 to get to the tritave, and 28 to get to the &quot;5/1-tave&quot;...this makes sense.</p><p>--The vals &lt;1, 2, 4] and &lt;0, -1, -4] (in the case of this<br/>particular ---mapping of meantone temperament) can be combined by a<br/>---mathematical operation called a &quot;wedge product&quot;, then normalized by<br/>--factoring out the greatest common divisor, resulting in a wedgie<br/>(short --for &quot;wedge invariant&quot;). The wedgie formed by wedging these<br/>meantone --vals (or any pair of vals that represents a meantone<br/>temperament map) ---is &lt;&lt;1, 4, 4]].</p><p>funny, I get<br/>*******************<br/>1 2 4<br/>vs<br/>0 -1 -4<br/>i = 0<br/>j = 1<br/>(val1[0] * val2[1]) - (val2[0] * val1[1])<br/>wedgiesize[0] = (1*-1) - (0*2) = -1<br/>----------<br/>i = 0<br/>j = 2<br/>(val1[0] * val2[2]) - (val2[0] * val1[2])<br/>wedgiesize[1] = (1*-4) - (0*4) = -4<br/>----------<br/>i = 1<br/>j = 2<br/>(val1[1] * val2[2]) - (val2[1] * val1[2])<br/>wedgiesize[2] = (2*4) - (-1*-4) = 4</p><p>IE the result vector -1,-4,4 and not 1,4,4.<br/>***************************************<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp; These &quot;Monzo vectors&quot; are confusing me...what did I do wrongly in the calculation?</p><p>-Michael</p><p>--- On Wed, 2/18/09, Carl Lumma &lt;carl@...g&gt; wrote:</p><p>From: Carl Lumma &lt;carl@...&gt;<br/>Subject: [tuning] Herman Miller&apos;s introduction to Regular Temperaments<br/>To: <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a><br/>Date: Wednesday, February 18, 2009, 11:58 PM</p><p>            For some reason I had not seen this, or at least never looked</p><p>at it properly.
