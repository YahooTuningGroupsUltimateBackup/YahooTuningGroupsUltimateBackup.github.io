I<br/>haven&apos;t had much time to post. I&apos;ll be back soon. Sorry if I&apos;m spotty in<br/>responding to replies before then. If anything is wrong with the lists, like<br/>we run out of file space, or people post spam in the link section, or people<br/>are flaming you, or Gene just snaps and starts banning people left and<br/>right, please mail me offlist and I will solve the problem asap.</p><p>As a side note, the activities of this list have so polluted my mind that I<br/>can no longer think of random sequences of numbers without immediately<br/>mapping applying regular mapping to them. Like someone mentioned to me this<br/>morning that our train left at 10:29, and I immediately went into this<br/>35-second disassociative break from reality where I started figuring out<br/>what temperament 10&amp;29 is (negri) and then what an optimal POTE tuning would<br/>be (I think around 19-equal). I had to cut myself off when I started trying<br/>to figure out what vals for 10 and 29 you&apos;d have to wedge to get negri, like<br/>whether it was the patent vals for 10 and 29 or how that&apos;d work. I dunno if<br/>I&apos;m the only one.</p><p>Cheers,<br/>Mike</p></div>
