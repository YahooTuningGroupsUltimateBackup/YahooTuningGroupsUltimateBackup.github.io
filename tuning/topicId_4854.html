However, another person<br/>independently came upon the same idea about the same time and presented<br/>some of his work at a conference in the 60&apos;s. I&apos;ll try to track down his<br/>name. According to Brian McLaren, who queried Chowning about Stria,<br/>Chowning was unaware of the prior work when he composed Stria.</p><p>--John</p></div><h3>Bill Schottstaedt &#x3C;bil@xxxxx.xxxxxxxx.xxxx&#x3E;</h3><span>9/16/1999 6:29:18 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>&gt; According to Brian McLaren, who queried Chowning about Stria,<br/>&gt; Chowning was unaware of the prior work when he composed Stria.</p><p>My vague recollection is that John was looking at FM wrap-arounds<br/>and discovered that this tuning had neat properties.</p></div>
