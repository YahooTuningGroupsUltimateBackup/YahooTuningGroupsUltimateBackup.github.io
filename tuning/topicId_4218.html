The intervals in the resulting scales could vary a lot and<br/>would really be more than two actual step sizes in most cases.  I&apos;m sure<br/>most of the scales probably sound fine, but it seems they would be much<br/>more loosely defined than their ET analogs.

A fun excersise in to take the Partch 11 limit Diamond and<br/>place it on a 41 tone keyboard (realizing you are going to have 2 places<br/>where pitches will fall upon each other) Then fill in the gaps without<br/>remembering Harrys scale. I learned alot about how Harry thought by this one<br/>because I filled it out differently. Wilson has come up with a 19-tone<br/>exspansion of My tuning, Centaur. Rod Poole came up with a different one, then<br/>a 22, then a 17, and then changed some of the Parent Pitches of Centaur.<br/>    What JI&apos;s have you been using out of curiosity?</p><p>-- Kraig Grady<br/>North American Embassy of Anaphoria Island<br/><a href="http://www.anaphoria.com">http://www.anaphoria.com</a></p></div>
