Anybody out there have this?  My initial<br/>reaction is skepticism, Carl.  How many pitch bend messages are you<br/>going to send per second?  Say one every 16 msec, about 64/sec.  Much<br/>closer than that and you&apos;ll clog the MIDI stream badly.  How fast does<br/>the gliss move?  Say 100 cents in 1/2 sec, just to grab a number out of<br/>the air.  Then each successive MIDI pitch bend message will jump by<br/>more than 3 cents!  The MIDI resolution is 40.96 bend units per cent;<br/>that seems like WAY more than would be needed for such a game.</p><p>If anything, I&apos;d expect the fine resolution to be useful for long,<br/>sustained pairs of notes.  Then, of course, in real life it&apos;s usually<br/>the playing synth that is limited.</p><p>In my own retuning glisses I typically used 64 msec spacing and was<br/>well content with the results.
