By tempering out the full<br/>comma which exists between the 5 pairs of<br/>&quot;superius/inferius&quot; pitches, he reduced the number<br/>of pitches from 24 to 19.</p><p>Below is a lattice which places Salinas&apos;s 1/3-comma<br/>meantone in prime-space and shows its relationship<br/>to his JI system, as he describes it; the slanted<br/>arrows represent the syntonic-comma:</p><p>[lattice diagram]</p><p>It can be seen that, with the exception of A# superius,<br/>all pitches of the meantone are either exactly those<br/>of Salinas&apos;s JI system, or are 1/3, 2/3, or a full comma<br/>higher or lower than those in his JI system.</p><p>He goes on to explain how to temper the 24-note JI system<br/>into 19 notes of 2/7-comma meantone, and then also into<br/>19 notes of 1/4-comma meantone, the latter of which he<br/>finally declares to be the best of the three temperaments.</p><p>Salinas did not explicitly mention the equal nature<br/>of the 8ve-division in his 1/3-comma meantone, but he<br/>would have known about it himself and it can be inferred<br/>from the measurements he described. The 19-tone systems<br/>of the 2/7-comma and 1/4-comma meantone are less<br/>equally-spaced, being rather closer to subsets of 50edo<br/>and 31edo, respectively.<br/>&quot;</p><p>-monz</p></div><h3><a id=43145 href="#43145">ðŸ”—</a>wallyesterpaulrus &#x3C;wallyesterpaulrus@yahoo.com&#x3E;</h3><span>3/31/2003 4:21:46 PM</span><button style="float: right;
