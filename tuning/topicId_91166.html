However, I probably wouldn&apos;t want to use a scale composed of only these intervals; they are very xenharmonic, but I&apos;m a firm believer in the idea that one needs some familiar intervals for contrast, or else the xenharmony gets obscured by its own &quot;shock value&quot;.</p><p>&gt;   Not to be a nudge but what&apos;s been said on this thread seems to hint there&apos;s an<br/>&gt; awful lot of 11-limit intervals that work on par, in many cases, with their<br/>&gt; lower-limit counterparts...I&apos;m wondering if there is a loophole in this idea or<br/>&gt; if the patterns I believe I&apos;m seeing really hold their ground.</p><p>I think it&apos;s more the case that 11-limit intervals are probably some of the most xenharmonic, and a lot of people on this list might have a bias toward favoring them.

I mean, people on the tuning list aren&apos;t a good sample population for determining whether intervals &quot;sound good&quot;, because we tend to either a much broader sense of what is harmonically acceptable, or else a much narrower one.</p><p>OTOH, when you consider that 12-tET is full of near-Just 17 and 19-limit intervals (18/17, 19/16, 24/19, 17/12, 19/12, 32/19, and 17/9), and average people find 12-tET perfectly acceptable, near-Just 11-limit intervals might very well be accepted.  I bet 13/11 and 14/11 could pass unnoticed by the average listener, and most would probably hear 11/8 as a variety of tritone (i.e. dissonant but still &quot;normal&quot;)...even 11/10 could probably pass as a whole-tone in the right context (like in 22-tET&apos;s Pajara/decatonic scale).  Maaaaybe you could sneak 15/11 by as a fourth.  Maaaaaybe.  It works in 9-EDO, more or less, but it really needs the help of the familiar 400&cent; major third.

Certainly 16:21:24:28 is for me impressively, spaciously,<br/>energetically, and transcendently concordant. What I might call<br/>the &quot;guide-intervals&quot; of the outer 7:4 minor seventh and upper<br/>7:6 minor third typically resolve by stepwise contrary motion to<br/>the fifth and unison respectively, although other people might<br/>treat this sonority pleasingly in many other ways. The effect for<br/>me is like an encompassing interstellar medium illuminated by the<br/>vibrant energy of the 21:16.</p><p>Especially smooth is 12:14:16:18:21, a type of septimal slendro<br/>and also, as George Secor has observed in the context of his<br/>17-tone well-temperament (17-WT) where the 64:63 is tempered out<br/>so that all fifths and fourths are close to 3:2 or 4:3, a fine<br/>closing sonority in many modern styles. While five-voice<br/>sonorities are a bit rich in many of my stylistic settings, I<br/>find that in a JI or near-JI version keeping the 21:16 between<br/>two upper voices, also, is very suave, and could well conclude a<br/>piece in the types of styles he addresses. In a neomedieval<br/>setting, I would typically resolve it much like 12:14:18:21, with<br/>the outer seventh contracting to a fifth and the minor thirds to<br/>unisons.</p><p>George Secor has more generally instilled in me an interest in<br/>isoharmonic chords or sonorities, with identical or similar<br/>differences between tones, with 11:16:21:26 as one of my early<br/>&quot;finds.&quot; Here the &quot;guide-interval&quot; is the outer minor tenth, at<br/>the quotidian ratio (as Ozan might say) of 13:11-plus-octave which seeks resolution to an octave. On a 24-note keyboard, with<br/>an asterisk showing a note on the upper 12-note manual raised by<br/>an interval of about 55-60 cents, a typical resolution might be:</p><p>           F*    E<br/>           C#*   B<br/>           A     B<br/>           D*    E</p><p>Here the lowest voice ascends by about a 12:11, while the highest<br/>descends by about a 13:12, thus resolving from 26:11 to 2:1.<br/>I realize that sooner or later I&apos;ll need to produce some mp3<br/>examples.</p><p>Conjuring up for me the image of a Big Band conductor at large in<br/>mostly unsuspected regions of the universe, George Secor has<br/>introduced me to such delights as 8:9:11:13 and 7:9:11:13, the<br/>latter having an especially compelling resolution with the outer<br/>voices of the large Zalzalian or neutral seventh at 13:7<br/>expanding to the octave as each moves by a semitone or thirdtone:</p><p>           Eb*  E<br/>           C*   B<br/>           A    B<br/>           E*   E</p><p>Typically E*-E is a descent of about 55-60 cents, and Eb*-E an<br/>ascent of around 70-80 cents, the two adding up to something like<br/>the 128 cents of 13:7, varying a bit, of course, in tempered<br/>systems.</p><p>An interesting idea I got from a discussion of an &quot;Infinity scale<br/>system&quot; was a sonority of 11:9:8:6 which is nicely approximated<br/>in a version of Maqam Penchgah that I use based on Mustaqim, a<br/>maqam like Rast but favoring a lower neutral third step which Ibn<br/>Sina places at 39:32 and in some systems I use is closer to 11:9.<br/>In Penchgah, the 4/3 of Rast or Mustaqim is replaced with a<br/>smallish &quot;tritone&quot; equal to the neutral third plus a tone at<br/>typically around 9:8, Here I give just ratios, often slightly<br/>tempered in practice, with the 11:6 neutral seventh and 11:9<br/>neutral third as &quot;guide-intervals&quot; resolving to fifth and unison:</p><p>     11/6  D*  12:13  C# 22/13<br/>     11/8  A*  16:13  C# 22/13<br/>     11/9  G*  12:13  F# 44/39<br/>      1/1  E   44:39  F# 44/39</p><p>While the added 11:8 might be a bit rich for the style of<br/>polyphony I often seek in a maqam or dastgan setting, where the<br/>counterpoint should support and adorn rather than overwhelm the<br/>_sayr_ or melodic &quot;path&quot; or procedure, I do find the effect<br/>striking. Note how the classic medieval steps of 9/8 and 27/16<br/>are often altered in the modern tuning systems I use to 44/39 and<br/>22/13 or the like.</p><p>The 11:8 is indeed, as Gene has said, a xenharmonic interval par<br/>excellence, and it may occur routinely in maqam-based polyphony<br/>or take on various more &quot;unusual&quot; effects. The 8:11:13 sonority<br/>has an intriguing quality, often inviting for me a resolution by<br/>way of another sonority introduced to me by George Secor, a<br/>suspended 16:21:24.</p><p>    13/8  F*    3/2   E           14/9  E*<br/>    11/8  D*   21/16 C#*  7/6 B*  28/27 A*<br/>     1/1  A                       28/27 A*</p><p>In my kind of typical stylistic context -- quite unlike in jazz<br/>based on some 12-note circulating concept -- a &quot;tritone<br/>substitution&quot; simply means a sonority where some kind of<br/>&quot;tritonic&quot; interval is used in place of a regular fifth or<br/>fourth. Here is one beautiful example using notes from a usual<br/>set for a septimal version of Dastgah-e Shur:</p><p>  7/4  F#*  13:14   F*  13/8<br/> 13/9  Eb*   9:8    F*  13/8<br/>  7/6  B*   13:14   Bb* 13/12<br/>  1/1  A    13:12   Bb* 13/12</p><p>Generally I would consider this four-voice version with 13/9,<br/>present in Shur as a _moteqayyer_ or variable step acting as a<br/>lowered version of the fifth often favored in descending passages<br/>and in certain of the gusheh-s or modal themes that make up the<br/>Shur family, as a bit ostentatious for a usual dastgah-based<br/>style, by comparison to a more routine 1/1-7/6-7/4 or 12:14:21. However, when colorful xenharmonicism is the goal, this version<br/>with the 13/9, ~36:42:52:63, is certainly ear-catching!</p><p>Now for the Tristan chord, or rather the kind of sonority I<br/>obtain with the same spelling of Eb-A-C#-F#. Here I find that<br/>attractive &quot;guide-intervals&quot; are the augmented sixth Eb-C#, a<br/>small neutral seventh at around 1038 cents or 51/28 in my current<br/>temperament, and the augmented ninth Eb-F#, likewise a small<br/>neutral tenth at around 1534 cents, an octave plus something like<br/>63/52, 40/33, or 17/14. As usual, the seventh tends to contract<br/>to a fifth, with the tenth accordingly contracting to an octave:</p><p>       1534  F#  -207   E 1327<br/>       1038  C#  -207   B  831<br/>        623  A   +207   B  831<br/>         0   Eb  +127   E  127</p><p>In this treatment, the regular augmented fourth or tritone A at<br/>623 cents, or somewhere between 63/44 and 56/39, adds color and<br/>tension while the small neutral seventh and tenth guide the<br/>progression, much as they would do in a familiar context like<br/>the following, shown in the close voicing I most often follow,<br/>although a wider spacing using a neutral tenth, I now realize,<br/>offers a pleasant variation:</p><p>       1038  C#  -207   B  831<br/>        704  Bb  +127   B  831<br/>        334  F#  -207   B  127<br/>         0   Eb  +127   E  127</p><p>In this kind of stylistic and intonational environment where the<br/>&quot;Tristan chord&quot; -- or its parallel universe counterpart! --<br/>brings into play small neutral sevenths and tenths and resolving<br/>steps around 14:13, the explanation of this colorful sonority<br/>may be rather less complicated than in the theoretical milieus<br/>where it has brought forth such an effusion of ink over the past<br/>century and more. However, one point does bear mention.</p><p>If the voices are transposed or inverted to produce the form<br/>A-C#-Eb-F#, then we have a different resolution that stands out,<br/>one guided by the intervals of the regular major third A-C# and<br/>major sixth A-F# expanding respectively to the fifth and<br/>octave. with the tritone (or here more precisely a diminished<br/>fifth A-Eb at around 39/28 or 88/63) again as an element of added<br/>tension or color:</p><p>        911  F#   +81   G  +992 (1200)<br/>        577  Eb   -81   D  +496 (704)<br/>        415  C#   +81   D  +496 (704)<br/>         0   A   -208   G  -208  (0)</p><p>Here the three-voice progressive of A-C#-F# to G-D-G is a<br/>14th-century European classic here realized in a modern<br/>temperament not too far from Pythagorean for the regular diatonic<br/>intervals (e.g. something around 33/26 or 14/11 for 81/64; 22/13<br/>for 27/16; and 22/21 for the classic limma at 256/243). with the<br/>tritone as a coloristic addition. This addition results in a<br/>curious quirk: a diminished third of 162 cents, fairly close to<br/>11:10, between the middle voices, resolves to a unison with each<br/>voice moving by a usual near-22:21 semitone!</p><p>This maybe not-so-routine resolution of a vertical diminished<br/>third, a touch worthy of the exotic expectations that might be<br/>aroused by an inversion of the &quot;Tristan chord&quot; (albeit hardly in<br/>a tuning intended by Wagner, whatever the parameters of that<br/>category might be), could be taken as a variation on the familiar<br/>idiom where an outer augmented sixth expands to an octave, with<br/>each voice moving by a regular semitone or limma:</p><p>       1038  C#   +81   D +1119 (1200)<br/>        415  G   +208   A  +623 (704)<br/>         0   Eb   -81   D  -81   (0)</p><p>Thus the &quot;Tristan chord&quot; and some of its associations as tuned<br/>in my neck of the xenharmonic woods.</p><p>This leaves us for the moment with one vital xenharmonic theme:<br/>the square root of two, of course, or 600 cents. While this<br/>interval is a very bulwark of some harmonic structures and styles<br/>including Paul Erlich&apos;s decatonic, and notably greeted with less<br/>than full enthusiasm in certain quarters, I find it simply one<br/>possible size for an augmented fourth or diminished fifth, and in<br/>one of my favorite tuning systems a rare interval thus worthy to<br/>be cherished in a very special use.</p><p>In this system the square root of 2 wasn&apos;t a planned feature,<br/>just a happy result of &quot;nanotempering&quot; on a device using binary<br/>millioctaves (1024-EDO). While &quot;nanotemperament&quot; may have<br/>different meanings for different people, for example a nuance so<br/>small as to be aurally undetectible and thus inconsequential, for<br/>me it is mainly a synonym for the pastime of reflectively<br/>performing the equivalent of Scala&apos;s QUANTIZE 1024.</p><p>Anyway, the xenoharmonic sonority leading to this story is<br/>12:14:17:21 or 1/1-7/6-17/12-7/4 (0-267-603-969 cents in JI), featuring the &quot;rare&quot; 17:12 tritone, only approximated at one<br/>location in this temperament, Eb-G#*. This could be viewed as<br/>another sonority where a tritone is substtituted for a usual<br/>fifth or fourth, here 17/12 in place of the 3/2 in 12:14:18:21.</p><p>An inspiration was Helmholtz with his diminished seventh chord at<br/>10:12:14:17, whose use of the 7:6 septimal minor third and 17:14<br/>&quot;supraminor&quot; third suggested to me 12:14:17:21, a variation<br/>combining two beloved sonorities: 12:14:21 (a common three-voice<br/>relative of the complete 12:14:18:21); and 14:17:21.</p><p>As it happened, in my chosen nanotemperament Eb-G#* came to 512<br/>binary millioctaves -- or, in other words, precisely 600 cents!<br/>And the result sounds just fine. with the minor complication on<br/>paper (or on screen) that steps at 57.4 and 761.7 cents round to<br/>57 and 762 cents, but form a fifth that rounds to 704 rather than<br/>705 cents:</p><p> 969  C*   -207   Bb* 762 (704)<br/> 600  G#*  +162   Bb* 762 (704)<br/> 265  F*   -207   Eb*  57  (0)<br/>  0   Eb    +57   Eb*  57  (0)</p><p>Here the guide-intervals are the minor third and seventh above<br/>the lowest voice at 265 and 969 cents, a slightly narrow 7/6 and<br/>virtually just 7/4, which contract to the unison and fifth, with<br/>the lowest voice ascending by a 57-cent step, the notably narrow<br/>tempered equivalent of 28:27 at 63 cents, and actually much<br/>closer to 91:88 at 58 cents. The upper three voices in themselves<br/>would form one of the standard resolutions from a tempered<br/>14:17:21 (here 0-335-704 cents) to a stable fifth, with the<br/>middle voice of this trio ascending G#*-Bb* or 162 cents, a<br/>virtually just 56:51.</p><p>At any rate, the 600-cent tempering of 17:12 sounds just fine,<br/>and maybe this escapade of tempering out the 289:288, the<br/>difference between 17:12 at 603 cents and 24:17 at 597 cents, may<br/>recall some of Paul Erlich&apos;s writings about the 50:49.</p><p>With many thanks,</p><p>Margo Schulter<br/>mschulter@...</p></div><h3><a id=91251 href="#91251">ðŸ”—</a>cityoftheasleep &#x3C;igliashon@...&#x3E;</h3><span>7/21/2010 6:41:35 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, Graham Breed &lt;gbreed@...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; On 21 July 2010 17:08, cityoftheasleep &lt;igliashon@...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; Well, those triads weren&apos;t 16/11 but 40/27, actually between 40/27 and 22/15 at 675&cent;, with thirds at 300&cent; and 375&cent;. &Acirc;&nbsp;But regardless--12-tET may hit within 13-15 cents of 5-limit JI diatonic,<br/>&gt; &lt;snip&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; 12-tET intervals don&apos;t, in fact, get within 15 cents of the JI<br/>&gt; diatonic.

Such is the peril of looking at ET&apos;s as approximations to JI scales.  In one modal rotation, the approximation may seem decent, but rotate to another mode, and the approximation seems poor.  If we look at the Dorian (ii) mode of the JI major scale 1/1-9/8-5/4-4/3-3/2-5/3-15/8-2/1, we have 1/1-10/9-32/27-4/3-40/27-5/3-16/9-2/1, two intervals of which are quite a ways from 12-tET.  Quite a different scale from a JI Dorian scale, which would probably be 1/1-9/8-6/5-4/3-3/2-5/3-9/5-2/1.  I guess that&apos;s the upshot of tempering: two JI ratios collapse into one tempered interval, so that interval&apos;s error really should take into account both of the collapsed intervals.  So the 12-tET major scale isn&apos;t just approximating the 5-limit JI major scale, it&apos;s also approximating the Ionian mode of other JI modes.  I never thought about this before.  Interesting.  So if you look at temperaments not just according to harmonics but as two JI scales merged by tempering out a comma, there&apos;s sort of a continuum where the approximations will lean closer to one scale than the other.  For instance, while 12-tET hits closer to 9/8, 32/27, 81/64, 4/3, 3/2, 27/16, and, 243/128, 19-tET is (variably) closer to 10/9, 6/5, 5/4, 27/20, 40/27, 5/3, and 15/8...this is giving me something to think about.</p><p>-Igs</p></div><h3><a id=91252 href="#91252">ðŸ”—</a>Michael &#x3C;djtrancendance@...&#x3E;</h3><span>7/21/2010 7:52:42 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Igs&gt; 12-tET intervals don&apos;t, in fact, get within 15 cents of the JI<br/>&gt; diatonic.

Especially considering the lack of balance in diatonic JI (IE almost<br/>everything is tremendously pure and then you have a fifth and minor third that<br/>are just about as sour as they can be).</p><p>   The way I see it, if you&apos;re willing to settle for a wolf fifth, there are so<br/>many other options than JI that get many more relaxed-sounding intervals as a<br/>result of &quot;compromising&quot; that fifth and often at least have &quot;wolf&quot; fifths that<br/>aren&apos;t nearly as disproportionately sour as diatonic JI&apos;s 40/27.<br/>   And if you give up two fifths or so ALA Ptolemy&apos;s scales I swear you get tons<br/>of very sweet sounding not to mention fresh and exotic intervals.</p></div><h3><a id=91253 href="#91253">ðŸ”—</a>genewardsmith &#x3C;genewardsmith@...&#x3E;</h3><span>7/22/2010 12:11:39 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, Margo Schulter &lt;mschulter@...&gt; wrote:</p><p>Thank you, Margo.
