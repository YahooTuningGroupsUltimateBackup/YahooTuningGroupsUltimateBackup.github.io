So I think I want to share some of the strange stuff that is haunting my head. There is one of Julien Weiss&apos;s various tuning systems that caught my attention - never heard how its sounds, I just liked the math. It goes as follows:</p><p>Take a basically pythagorean skeleton, i.e pythagorean whole tone (9/8, 204 cents), pythagorean minor second or limma (256/243, 90 cents) and its difference (2187/2048, apotome, 114 cents). Divide the apotome into 3 equal parts, which gives 38 cents, and add that to the limma, which gives 128 cents. And that is a close approximation for 14/13, a 2/3-tone, one of the various middle seconds that occur in maqams (AFAIK, at least).</p><p>Now the point is that Julien Weiss&apos;s complete systems encompass 105 tones per octave, which is good for the qanun but much too many notes for me... I just wonder if the ideas sketched above can be used (or maybe have already been used) for some kind of maqam temperament or something?<br/>--<br/>Hans Straub</p></div><h3><a id=101831 href="#101831">ðŸ”—</a>Carl Lumma &#x3C;carl@...&#x3E;</h3><span>10/19/2011 1:37:53 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;hstraub64&quot; &lt;straub@...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Argh, it seems I got infected by a kind of maqam virus, too...</p><p>You may like to play around with</p><p><a href="http://tarsos.0110.be">http://tarsos.0110.be</a></p><p>Be sure to report your results here if so!</p><p>-Carl</p></div><h3><a id=101835 href="#101835">ðŸ”—</a>Margo Schulter &#x3C;mschulter@...&#x3E;</h3><span>10/19/2011 9:31:01 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>&gt; Argh, it seems I got infected by a kind of maqam virus,<br/>&gt; too... I apparently got it from writing the XenWiki page about<br/>&gt; Julien Weiss&apos;s tunings for qanun<br/>&gt; &lt;<a href="http://xenharmonic.wikispaces.com/tuning+systems+for+qanun">http://xenharmonic.wikispaces.com/tuning+systems+for+qanun</a>&gt;.</p><p>Dear Hans,</p><p>This is a great page! Jacques Dudon called my attention to some<br/>of these tunings by Julien Jalaleddine Weiss.</p><p>A caution at the start: translating from his divisions of the<br/>apotome (e.g 38-38-38 cents) to divisions of the tetrachord is<br/>something I do below, and may or may not be clear. Please feel<br/>free to ask questions, which may help me improve my presentation!</p><p>&gt; So I think I want to share some of the strange stuff that is<br/>&gt; haunting my head. There is one of Julien Weiss&apos;s various tuning<br/>&gt; systems that caught my attention - never heard how its sounds,<br/>&gt; I just liked the math. It goes as follows:</p><p>&gt; Take a basically pythagorean skeleton, i.e pythagorean whole<br/>&gt; tone (9/8, 204 cents), pythagorean minor second or limma<br/>&gt; (256/243, 90 cents) and its difference (2187/2048, apotome, 114<br/>&gt; cents). Divide the apotome into 3 equal parts, which gives 38<br/>&gt; cents, and add that to the limma, which gives 128 cents. And<br/>&gt; that is a close approximation for 14/13, a 2/3-tone, one of the<br/>&gt; various middle seconds that occur in maqams (AFAIK, at least).</p><p>This is quite correct: with 38-38-38 we have 90-128-166-204<br/>cents. If 14/13 is just, then the steps within the tone for this<br/>division would be 1/1-256/243-14/13-208/189-9/8.</p><p>Actually one could trace this type of division back to Ibn Sina<br/>around a millennium ago (his dates are 980-1037) with a<br/>tetrachord of 1/1-9/8-63/52-4/3 (0-204-332-498 cents), or<br/>9:8-14:13-208:189 (steps of 204-128-166 cents). At 166 cents, the<br/>208:189 is not quite a cent larger than a simpler 11:10.</p><p>A 2/3-tone around 14/13 or 128 cents might occur in a low Persian<br/>Shur or Turkish Ushshaq, where J. J. Weiss&apos;s division of<br/>128-166-204 would be fine.</p><p>In Lebanon, Amine Beyhom says that a &quot;popular&quot; or &quot;folk&quot; tuning<br/>for the similar Maqam Bayyati favors a step around 130 cents, so<br/>a 128-166-204 division would likely be right at home. It varies<br/>with region and style: a classic Egyptian Bayyati might be more<br/>like 140-154-204, for example, assuming a just 9/8 and 32/27.</p><p>And with Weiss&apos;s 38-38-38 division of the apotome, we can get not<br/>only 128-166-204, but also 166-128-204 for a good Turkish Maqam<br/>Huseyni. And with this tuning we also get 204-166-128, a great<br/>classic Ottoman Rast with a 370-cent third (26/21), as Weiss<br/>mentions in the notes for one of his albums.</p><p>Anyway, Weiss&apos;s 38-38-38 division is very useful!</p><p>&gt;  Now the point is that Julien Weiss&apos;s complete systems<br/>&gt;  encompass 105 tones per octave, which is good for the qanun<br/>&gt;  but much too many notes for me... I just wonder if the ideas<br/>&gt;  sketched above can be used (or maybe have already been used)<br/>&gt;  for some kind of maqam temperament or something?</p><p>Obviously with 17 or 24 notes per octave rather than 105, there<br/>will be compromises, but I&apos;d say his ideas have lots of potential<br/>for temperaments and smaller systems generally also!</p><p>Actually, what happens is that I may get each of the neutral<br/>sizes, or something reasonably close, _somewhere_ in a 24-note<br/>system -- but not with lots of choices all over the place, as<br/>with his 105-note qanun!</p><p>For example (Weiss&apos;s &quot;First System&quot;, not all steps shown!):</p><p>[90]-125-138-150-166-[204]</p><p>And one of my tempered tunings:</p><p>[81]-125-139-150-163-[207]</p><p>The difference is that I need to move around the system to get<br/>all of these, with at most two available at any one location:<br/>maybe 125 and 150, or 139 and 163 -- but not all of them in way<br/>lots of places, as on his qanun!</p><p>How things get warped or distorted a bit in tempered systems is<br/>another topic I&apos;d be glad to discuss, but Weiss&apos;s tunings are a<br/>real dream come true!</p><p>&gt;   --<br/>&gt;   Hans Straub</p><p>Best,</p><p>Margo</p></div>
