For example, a 5-limit triad has three<br/>5-limit consonances. A 7-limit tetrad has six 7-limit consonances. A 9-limit pentad has ten 9-limit<br/>consonances. An 11-limit hexad has fifteen 11-limit consonances. Nothing gets compounded --<br/>every single interval in every one of these chords is within 4 cents of JI in 72-tET.</p><p>If the harmony is constructed differently, then yes, errors can be compounded in the _dissonant_<br/>intervals. For example, if 5:4 is 2.5 cents flat, then 25:16 will be 5 cents flat. But that doesn&apos;t<br/>matter, since 25:16 is dissonant anyway, and can&apos;t be tuned directly by ear. So whether it&apos;s just<br/>or 5 cents flat or 5 cents sharp, 25:16 will have basically the same effect. In a chord composed<br/>of stacking two 5:4 intervals, it&apos;s the 5:4 intervals that give the chord its consonance, not the outer<br/>25:16.</p><p>&gt; or<br/>&gt; would you just pick the next nearest tone in the 72ET galaxy.</p><p>Nope -- then one of the consonances may have to suffer a greatly</p><p>&gt;<br/>&gt; In other words, if you had a seventh or ninth chord (traditional<br/>&gt; terminology)</p><p>Traditional terminology is completely ambiguous . . . do you mean a simple otonal 7- or 9-limit<br/>chord?</p><p>&gt; and all of the intervals are off by as much as 3 cents,<br/>&gt; does this make the chord less stable, make it wobble, or in general<br/>&gt; be a lot less pleasant than a strict JI chord?</p><p>This is independent of what I wrote above, so treat it separately:</p><p>In my experience, much larger errors can be tolerated in a complete 7- or 9-limit otonal chord<br/>than in an isolated 7- or 9-limit interval. If, say, an isolated 9:7 is, say, 10 cents out-of-tune, there<br/>is considerable uncertainty as to what is actually being heard, as compared with a just 9:7, in a<br/>favorable register and timbre. In this context, a 10-cent out-of-tune 9:7 is not a 9:7 in any way . .<br/>. it&apos;s simply a dissonant interval. However, if the chord is 4:5:6:7:9, the brain will quickly<br/>understand that the 7:9 interval represents the 7th and 9th harmonics of an implied fundamental<br/>-- even if the 9:7 is 10 cents out-of-tune.</p></div><h3>JSZANTO@ADNC.COM</h3><span>6/9/2001 1:48:11 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Paul,</p><p>Thanks for the reply!</p><p>--- In tuning@y..., &quot;Paul Erlich&quot; &lt;paul@s...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt; Nothing gets compounded -- every single interval in every one of<br/>&gt; these chords is within 4 cents of JI in 72-tET.</p><p>Yes, I figured that, I just wondered if multiple discrepancies of a<br/>few cents had more, negligable, or less effect -- on the listener --<br/>than a simple interval.</p><p>&gt; If the harmony is constructed differently, then yes, errors can be<br/>&gt; compounded in the _dissonant_ intervals.</p><p>And I realize that I was mostly concerned with the consonant ones.<br/>For some reason, in the kind of music I would imagine wanting to<br/>make, I&apos;d like the consonances be just that, and then have a lot of<br/>different kinds (or degrees) of dissonance.</p><p>&gt; Traditional terminology is completely ambiguous . . . do you mean a<br/>&gt; simple otonal 7- or 9-limit chord?</p><p>Yes, sorry for not being more clear.</p><p>&gt; In my experience, much larger errors can be tolerated in a complete<br/>&gt; 7- or 9-limit otonal chord than in an isolated 7- or 9-limit<br/>&gt; interval.</p><p>That&apos;s interesting.
