I<br/>would at least wanna keep the option of not smoothing out the change of<br/>intonation as a pitch changes its harmonic position. What brought it to my<br/>attention again was some recording of shape-note sings of which I was part<br/>several years ago. I was Cool-editing the old tapes and getting them to<br/>sound much better and I realized that, other than the fact that we&apos;re all<br/>yelling our heads off all about hellfire, brimstone, damnation and all such<br/>tame subjects, the thing that makes that music so effective is the pumping<br/>of pitches. Sometimes it&apos;s a function of tone-painting -- when we sang<br/>&quot;Jehova shut them in&quot; the &quot;in&quot; is the higher member of a minor third and<br/>wow, did we flatten it consistently -- and other times the note is shifted<br/>so as to make its half-step relationship to the next note narrower. Fifths<br/>and octaves get nailed right on, no matter what, but thirds are all over the<br/>map. And those passing tones? Those are some of the most wicked seconds alive.<br/>This isn&apos;t much evident in most of the commercial recordings. Ya gotta gota<br/>a convention with a couple gazillion people. And in spite of all that<br/>pumping, we usually end up essentially on the same tonic pitch we start<br/>with. There&apos;s one marvelous fellow from Georgia who assumed the role of<br/>official pitchgiver who, when he intoned the major thirds of the tonic<br/>chord, consistently sang a highly stretched interval. The choir as a whole<br/>then settled the note down to something more or less Pythagorean, to my ear<br/>at least. Nach, it&apos;s impossible to make accurate measurements of such an<br/>aggregation of untrained voices, but I know I&apos;d never get by with tuning the<br/>thirds on a piano like those. &lt;grin&gt;<br/>I&apos;m not, for a moment, arguing that the sound of pumping pitches is<br/>appropriate for this or that musical style. I&apos;m just saying I like hearing<br/>it and that I know of at least one style in Western music in which it abounds.</p></div><h3><a id=8366 href="#8366">ðŸ”—</a>Paul H.

The style derives from John Playford&apos;s time in England. Although the<br/>harmonies are &quot;functional&quot; in the major/minor sense, the minor key ones,<br/>especially, are what many people would call &quot;modal&quot; that is, they&apos;re _never<br/>in harmonic minor, but a mix of Dorian and Melodic Minor. As I either said<br/>or implied, the groups that make recordings try their best to attain JI, but<br/>in the sings at conventions where the &quot;folks&quot; are, other principles abound.<br/>When I spoke of leading tones, I not only meant those from 7 to 1, but the<br/>downward ones like from 6o to 5 in a minor subdominant to dominant. It&apos;s<br/>this latter that&apos;s noticeable narrowed on many occasions.</p><p>&gt;&gt; [Paul]<br/>&gt;&gt; Also, the standard JI approach makes leading-tone<br/>&gt;&gt; relationships wider.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;Again, if this song has blues-ish tuning, pitches are likely<br/>&gt;to be far different from a &apos;normal&apos; 5-limit JI interpretation.<br/>&gt;As Jay said,<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt; [jay]<br/>&gt;&gt; Fifths and octaves get nailed right on, no matter what, but<br/>&gt;&gt; thirds are all over the map.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;I find in studying the tuning of blues songs that thirds<br/>&gt;can be major, minor, neutral, super-major, sub-minor, or<br/>&gt;any number of other in-between varieties.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;And, contrary to Jay&apos;s experience with this performance, in<br/>&gt;many great blues songs even the &apos;5ths&apos; and &apos;octaves&apos; can also<br/>&gt;be &apos;all over the map&apos;!  (again, see my Robert Johnson page)<br/>Yep, I&apos;ve heard that, too, lotsa recordings by &apos;20&apos;s blues singers are<br/>intonationally liberated for every interval, but not so, the octaves,<br/>fourths, and fifths in shape note singing.<br/>These hymns are written in three parts; the women sing the 3 parts an octave<br/>higher so it&apos;s a six part texture.</p><p>&gt;&gt; [Paul]<br/>&gt;&gt; I agree with John Link: please do an analysis and show<br/>&gt;&gt; us what&apos;s happening.<br/>Hmmm. I know I&apos;ve been unaccountably mum, but fact is, I&apos;ve binna ponderin&apos;<br/>what sorta analysis I could provide that would be of use. I&apos;m not in a<br/>position to scan the music and send it along, but maybe I could manufacture<br/>a MIDI file of one of these thingies and bend the pitches to approximate<br/>what I&apos;ve heard them do. For &quot;authenticity&quot;&apos;s sake, I could stuff in the<br/>program number for that &quot;chorus of voices&quot; patch. Or, I could send an mp3<br/>file and someone could upload it to an appropriate place. (I&apos;ve not dealt<br/>with the uploading of such, yet.)<br/>Ya see, if y&apos;awls could read Braille music, this would be so easy. Anything<br/>in that code has an ASCII equivalent. &lt;grin&gt;<br/>Btw, I tried going to <a href="http://www.shapenote.com">http://www.shapenote.com</a> and got there, but my<br/>screen-reader didn&apos;t seem ta make anything outa what&apos;s there. Or, is it<br/>really blank?<br/>Oh! But I just found one truly wondrous example of the kind of anomalies<br/>people put in this stuff. In the hymn called &quot;Soar Away!&quot; which is in D<br/>minor, on the words, &quot;Fly! Fly! Fly!&quot;, the melody is D-quarter F-quarter<br/>F-half and the chords are all D minor: root position, second inversion, root<br/>position. The tenor line is: A, D, D. Well! on one rendition I have the<br/>tenors consistently flatten the second D -- the one in the 6/4 voicing -- so<br/>it feels like an augmented triad but in great and glorious need of resolution.<br/>&gt;Yes, please!

In fact, li&apos;ll Louis Braille thought up<br/>the code as a music aid and it was only later adapted for literate texts.<br/>So, for example, an ASCII ? is a quarter-note C and a : is a quarter-note D<br/>and so on. If you or anyone wants, though, I can sendja a table of all that<br/>stuff that shows in a general way how the system works.
