I have uploaded a 35 second long example of my drone<br/>sound design to my folder in the files section for everyone to check<br/>out. This one is in the key of E, which is the lowest functional note<br/>I can sing in. It has always interested me to know what my vocal 1/1<br/>is - which seems to be E.</p><p>Here I have layered the sweeps of harmonics 1-16, 1-8 and 1-4, so<br/>there is constant movement going on. Any comments are welcome and if<br/>anyone feels so compelled, you may use this sample in your music,<br/>provided you let me hear what you do with it.  I have a compliment of<br/>JI scales that I use over this kind of drone, which are derived from<br/>a series I have grown to call the &quot;Harmonic Mirror&quot;, of which there<br/>are 12 - a scale for each month of the year. Some of this I&apos;ve spoken<br/>about before here.</p><p>Yes, I have enjoyed David Beardsley&apos;s music too for all these<br/>attributes.</p></div>
