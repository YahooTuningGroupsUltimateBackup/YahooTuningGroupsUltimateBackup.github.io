I&apos;m most interested in using ratios<br/>&gt;rather than 24 TET - just wondering how it&apos;s used in the actual music<br/>&gt;and theory of Arabic Music.</p><p>We had some debate about this here on the list, and there&apos;s really too much<br/>variety between different parts of the Arabic world, and too much divergence<br/>between theory and practice, for there to be one definitive answer to your<br/>question. As I see it, all kinds of creative deviations from the modern<br/>standard 24-tET can be justified on theoretical and/or cultural grounds, but<br/>I wouldn&apos;t automatically stuff everything into the nearest just ratios<br/>unless I were going to make a significant use of harmony (which is rare in<br/>Arabic music). If I were, I&apos;d make sure the ratios provided for simple<br/>proportions in the intervals to be used as harmonies (rather than worrying<br/>about whether they looked simple on their own), and didn&apos;t run into any<br/>comma difficulties (such as the &quot;wolf&quot; fifth between 9/8 and 5/3 if I<br/>planned to use the D-A harmony in the C major &quot;just&quot; scale). Otherwise, I&apos;d<br/>see no real reason to choose just ratios over 24-tET, though in many cases<br/>(11/9, 3/2, etc.), it wouldn&apos;t make an audible difference.</p></div>
