There is more activity in non-12 in NYC than most anywhere on the<br/>planet.  However, early music everywhere has not been properly labeled in its<br/>packaging when it is tuned non-12.  This is true even for Koopman and Uchida<br/>recordings, some of the best.  Not all trust their ears for the distinctions<br/>of the different constellations of pitch available to the modern musician to<br/>use.</p><p>Sieman Terpstra, now in Amsterdam, does regularly turn up early music<br/>performances in non-12TET, however undisclosed in the liner notes.  The Dutch<br/>have been leaders in early music performance in non-12TET.  Dutch recorder<br/>players play non-12TET on an intuitive level with little intellectual<br/>underpinning.</p><p>While there are those resistant to exploration of this kind in NY as<br/>elsewhere, they are feeling besieged by the rising tuning afficiandi, now<br/>including Bernard Holland who has been writing about unequal Bach of late in<br/>our local paper of record.</p><p>And it is one thing to learn a new orientation (like meantone) by ear, only<br/>to wrestle with different varieties of meantone, irregular temperaments, and<br/>pure Pythagorean, mostly in live performance, undocumented.  Additionally,<br/>most New Yorkers are from elsewhere and bring many different intonational<br/>points of view for exploration.</p><p>Johnny Reinhard<br/>AFMM</p></div><h3><a id=8800 href="#8800">ðŸ”—</a>Daniel Wolf &#x3C;djwolf@snafu.de&#x3E;</h3><span>2/24/2000 7:02:51 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Johnny Reinhard:</p><p>The question was about non-12tet organ performances. In the archives of the<br/>organ list I found no mention of an organ in a historical tuning in New York<br/>City, but many elsewhere (I mentioned a continuo organ in Jackson).  I would<br/>be delighted to know of any news to the contrary.</p><p>It&apos;s standard practice now that pre-romantic instruments be restored to<br/>historical tunings. Recordings do not usually advertise this attribute, but<br/>if the recording involves a pre-romantic instrument and there is any mention<br/>of restoration in the past fourty years, it&apos;s a good indicator. Another good<br/>indicator is whether or not the instruments have a _Terz_ stop, a register<br/>matching the fifth harmonic, and nearly unbearable in anything but meantone<br/>or an unequal temperament with good major thirds. The United States, having<br/>very few original organs to restore does have many outstanding new<br/>baroque-style organs in historical tunings, notably those by Brombaugh and<br/>Fisk.</p><p>I live in a modest outer district of Frankfurt, with an even more modest<br/>reputation for musical activities. There are, however, three churches with<br/>pipe organs in the district: one is a restored classical organ in 1/6 comma<br/>meantone, two are small modern baroque-style organs in Kirnberger III.<br/>None of the organists here has a special interest in historical practices,<br/>the tunings just came with the instruments or the restoration.  Apparently,<br/>12tet (or the absence thereof) is simply not an issue here.</p><p>Daniel Wolf</p></div><h3><a id=8812 href="#8812">ðŸ”—</a>Afmmjr@aol.com</h3><span>2/24/2000 3:12:14 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>There are a few non-12TET organs in New York.  St. Adolphous Lutheran has an<br/>organ that has long been tuned to 1/6th comma meantone.  This organ is almost<br/>entirely utilized for church services.</p><p>Another is in the concert hall at Queens College which can be switched into<br/>Vallotti.  This availability is reputed to be at faculty member Joel<br/>Mandelbaum&apos;s suggestion.</p><p>Johnny Reinhard<br/>AFMM</p></div>
