Erlich&quot; &lt;<a href="mailto:PErlich@Acadian-Asset.com">PErlich@Acadian-Asset.com</a>&gt;<br/>&gt; Subject: Reply to Robert C Valentine<br/>&gt;<br/>I had written :<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;   &quot;given an equal tempterment, can I write a program that will come up<br/>&gt; &gt;    with a reasonable, quasi-meantone treatment&quot;.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;For instance, type in &quot;17&quot;, and get out<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;  major scale : 3 3 1 3 3 3 1<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;</p><p>To which Paul replied :</p><p>&gt; Yuck! Have you heard the triads this produces?<br/>&gt;</p><p>Nope, but in my spreadsheet, it looks like the major triad will have a<br/>good deal of &apos;snarl&apos;. The point was really in the following paragraph.</p><p>&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;<br/>The idea being that transposition and alterations used in 12 TET would<br/>have a mathematically consistant mapping in the new temperment (i.e.,<br/>sharping the &apos;F&apos; will produce a G scale that is a transposed version of<br/>the C scale).<br/>&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;</p><p>The algorithm works great for quasi-meantone temperments, 19, 26, 31 etc...<br/>These were the ones I was most interested in, and I wanted to make sure that<br/>the same common music text file would get the correct notes in the new<br/>temperment.</p><p>You are correct that applying these rules to other temperments<br/>will produce some &apos;interesting&apos; cases (hold your nose AND your ears).</p><p>FOr instance, the algorithm I adopted, given a request for 21 tone equal,<br/>determines that</p><p>   whole step = 5<br/>   half step = -2<br/>   sharp = 7 flat = -7</p><p>and C D E F G A B (C) = 0 5 10 8 13 18 23 (21)</p><p>Add an F# (8-&gt;15) and sure enough, starting on G produces a transposed<br/>sequence.</p><p>Along these lines, I attempted the same thing with scales of the type</p><p>   l m s l m l s (for instance 53TET 9 8 5 9 8 9 5, or 22Tet 4 3 2 4 3 4 2,<br/>                      or 17TET 3 2 2 3 2 3 2).</p><p>This immediately showed some of the problems with &quot;non-meantone&quot; tunings.<br/>The same goal (consistent trasposition) immediately falls apart. What the<br/>algorithm WANTS to do is create a vector for the sharps and flats. For<br/>instance, F# in 22TET wants to be (0, 0, 2, 0, 1, 0, 0) to move key of C<br/>to key of G. In two or three transpositions, the original root starts to<br/>drift. Non-key alterations produce bizarre results (for instance, minor<br/>tonality seems to want a different system).</p><p>Bob Valentine</p></div>
