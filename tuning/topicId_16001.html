West has written a very good article on it in Music and Letters<br/>around 1993  or 94 and offered a new transcription. The group &quot;De<br/>Organographia&quot; in Oregon City, OR (USA) has performed it and the rest of<br/>the Hurrian hymns on their CD &quot;Music of the Ancient Sumerians, Egyptians<br/>and Greeks.&quot; They use reconstructed instruments for the pieces. Since<br/>most of the surviving Greek and Near Eastern music texts are<br/>fragmentary, they&apos;ve &quot;repaired (sic) some of them with thematically<br/>similar material, as they did for their earlier CD, &quot;Music of the<br/>Ancient Greek.&quot;</p><p>I&apos;ve enjoyed their renditions very much, particularly those on the first<br/>CD, though there is a bit too much reverb on the vocal parts sometimes<br/>for my taste and the tempo is surprisingly fast in Mesomedes&apos;s hymns.</p><p>The tuning is basically pythagorean, even for the enharmonic passages<br/>which have notes altered by approximate quarter-tones.</p><p>The Egyptian pieces are based on literary references and instrument<br/>characters, not on notation. I&apos;d be very interested in seeing the<br/>publication of the Egyptian musical fragment and an interpretation of<br/>its notation. There are also some later Coptic musical notations, but I<br/>don&apos;t believe they are readable (Spud, you might know?).</p><p>As the rest of De Organographia&apos;s repertory is &quot;early music,&quot; perhaps<br/>Margo can comment better than I on their musicianship and interpretation.</p><p>--John</p></div>
