I had been intuitively working with just<br/>intonation for the past three years and today, for accident, i<br/>landed here... I have taken a look at many of the previous posts,<br/>trying to get used with the right -or most accepted- names used<br/>around tuning, so i hope you will understand my question! :)</p><p>When traveling through the circle of fifths in the 12-tET, you land<br/>again on the inicial note after 12 jumps... That won&grave;t happen when<br/>you are using JI.</p><p>Interested in this fact, i started building structures in reaktor3,<br/>which periodically multiplied the reference frequency of a chord by<br/>a simple just ratio (3/2 , 4/3 , 9/8) and took the result as the new<br/>reference. -obviously i introduced an &quot;autooctaver&quot; which ensured<br/>that the reference would not get out of a desired range.-</p><p>The chords were made up of randomly selected harmonics of the<br/>dynamic reference frequency, which i started to call &quot;dynamic<br/>tonic&quot;. I have the impression that when listening to such a<br/>structure, one starts expecting further modulations, and looses the<br/>need of remainig around a static tonality.</p><p>Does anyone know more about that? Is there a more correct way to<br/>call this &quot;dynamic tonic&quot;?</p><p>Thanks<br/>Kiko Mayorga</p></div><h3>Jon Szanto &#x3C;JSZANTO@ADNC.COM&#x3E;</h3><span>10/13/2002 8:40:01 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Kiko,</p><p>--- In tuning@y..., &quot;kikomayorga&quot; &lt;kikomayorga@y...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt; Hello!</p><p>Same!</p><p>You&apos;re into an interesting area, and two things came to mind...</p><p>&gt; The chords were made up of randomly selected harmonics of the<br/>&gt; dynamic reference frequency, which i started to call &quot;dynamic<br/>&gt; tonic&quot;.

Is there a more correct way to<br/>&gt; call this &quot;dynamic tonic&quot;?</p><p>I don&apos;t think that there is much to theorize about this-it&apos;s a<br/>psychological issue, related to the subjective effects of movement and<br/>&quot;tension&quot;.<br/>I&apos;ve done some similar things with Audiomulch though, using ring<br/>modulation and granulators for transposing. If you use a sine wave,<br/>you can use pretty much any intervals (non-just) because there are no<br/>harmonic overtones to conflict with. So the distinction between<br/>&quot;several notes&quot; and &quot;partials&quot; dissapear, so to speak. I am going to<br/>put some of this material up when i am finished with it.</p><p>/Mats &Ouml;ljare<br/><a href="http://oljare.iuma.com">http://oljare.iuma.com</a></p></div><h3>monz &#x3C;monz@attglobal.net&#x3E;</h3><span>10/13/2002 10:34:29 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>hi Kiko and Jon,</p><p>&gt; From: &quot;Jon Szanto&quot; &lt;<a href="mailto:JSZANTO@ADNC.COM">JSZANTO@ADNC.COM</a>&gt;<br/>&gt; To: &lt;<a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>&gt;<br/>&gt; Sent: Sunday, October 13, 2002 8:40 PM<br/>&gt; Subject: [tuning] Re: &quot;dynamic tonic&quot;?<br/>&gt;</p><p>&gt; Kiko,<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; --- In tuning@y..., &quot;kikomayorga&quot; &lt;kikomayorga@y...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt; &gt; Hello!<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Same!<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; You&apos;re into an interesting area, and two things came to mind...<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; The chords were made up of randomly selected harmonics of the<br/>&gt; &gt; dynamic reference frequency, which i started to call &quot;dynamic<br/>&gt; &gt; tonic&quot;.
