One way is to use a sequencer /<br/>score editor.</p><p>I use NoteWorthyComposer actually - I find it really fast to enter notes<br/>into it by hand. The keyboard shortcuts and things are very<br/>intelligently worked out and quick to use and you can work up<br/>a short score in next to no time. (Not so good if<br/>one wants to write polyrhythms like 5 against 7 or whatever<br/>though)</p><p>Anyway, your favourite score editor, write the piece in 12-tet notation,<br/>and add a note saying which scale you want the notes tuned to.<br/>If scale has more than 12 notes, one option is to use two octaves<br/>of the 12-tet score for one octave of the result.</p><p>My tunes page has various examples of pieces composed in this<br/>way in various scales.</p><p><a href="http://members.tripod.com/~robertinventor/tunes/tunes.htm">http://members.tripod.com/~robertinventor/tunes/tunes.htm</a></p><p>Then, hook midi out of your score editor to the midi in of<br/>FTS using a midi loopback driver, such as Midi Yoke.</p><p>Paste the appropriate scale into FTS.</p><p>Now whenever you click Play in the score editor you will<br/>hear it retuned accordingly.</p><p>I can say that this works very well for me and is a way to<br/>quickly get to hear what a piece sounds like. If this<br/>looks as if it could be of interest, get in touch and<br/>I will help with any questions about how to do it.</p><p>You can also hook your midi keyboard into the Midi In (usually<br/>via the joystick of computer, or soundcard midi in) and then<br/>play it retuned to 19-tet in FTS. Actually FTS also has a couple of<br/>19-tet presets for midi relaying. One plays the 19-tet major<br/>scale from the white notes, with the black notes toggling between<br/>sharps or flats depending on whether you have the caps lock on,<br/>or sustain pedal held down (or various other methods available,<br/>including an option to toggle sharps / flats if you play more<br/>than a certain velocity). The other preset plays 19-tet from<br/>alternate white notes, with in between notes playing the<br/>accidentals (with some repeats when two keys play the same<br/>note).</p><p>What you describe also sounds as though it might tie in well with<br/>the very new scales for tracks feature in FTS.</p><p>Could have several staves and for each one say which scale you<br/>want it played in, then assign Midi channel 1 to play the 1st one,<br/>channel 2 for the 2nd and so on.</p><p>Then in FTS, select the appropriate scale into each track.</p><p>You use SCALA for working with the scales, making new scales,<br/>can also use it for retuning a 12-tet midi file to some other<br/>tuning. You don&apos;t need SCALA to run FTS, or vice versa,<br/>but they complement each other well.</p><p>SCALA works for a wider range of platforms than FTS -<br/>FTS is pretty much tied down to Windows type platforms,<br/>or p.c. emulators in other platforms (if you can find<br/>one that supports sound) as it uses native Windows c<br/>subroutines that are specific to the platform.</p><p>Robert</p></div>
