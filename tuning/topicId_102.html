I&apos;m very disappointed in<br/>her remark as quoted here, but I&apos;ve faced exactly the same misunderstanding<br/>for years in the pedal steel world.  Most of us steel players use electronic<br/>tuners and tune to JI.  In talking about it, most steel players refer to JI<br/>as &quot;tempered tuning&quot;.  Even some of the literature makes that mistake.</p><p>The Internet is starting to change that.  In the Steel Guitar Forum at<br/><a href="http://www.b0b.com/forum">www.b0b.com/forum</a> a few of us clarify any references to &quot;tempered tuning&quot;<br/>and get people on track with the proper terminology.  It&apos;s getting to where<br/>we can use the abbreviations JI and ET and people know what we&apos;re talking<br/>about.</p><p>Before the Internet came along, finding information about tuning issues (or<br/>about the steel guitar) was a major research task.  Today you can type<br/>&quot;microtonal&quot; into a search engine and get all of these references, and most<br/>of them are actually filled with correct information.  My guess is that<br/>Liona Boyd is so preoccupied with keeping her chops up that she doesn&apos;t get<br/>on the net much.</p><p>    -b0b-</p><p><a href="http://www.b0b.com">http://www.b0b.com</a></p></div>
