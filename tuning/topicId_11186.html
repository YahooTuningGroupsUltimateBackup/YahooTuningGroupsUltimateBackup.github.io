Since this is one of the more sensitive topics on the list, I&apos;ve<br/>kept to myself until now.  I am in no way an _expert_ on Partch, but have<br/>studied his scores, read Enclosures as well as Genesis.  The main thing that<br/>I got from all of my study is that he was an innovator, a complex man, and a<br/>musical genious worthy enough to bring his music to live performance today.<br/> Last December I organized a performance at the University of Michigan of<br/>Barstow with our Digital Music Ensemble.  I worked on it for a full year<br/>researching the piece, studying the score and determining how to perform it.<br/>I built an acoustic version of the Surrogate Kithara working with a wood<br/>sculpture student.  I emulated the Chromelodeon with an 88 Key midi<br/>controller running a self-designed TX81Z Chromelodeon patch.  The stops were<br/>emulated with switches on top of the keyboard controller run through Opcode<br/>Max.  As well a volume pedal controlled an effects processor simulating the<br/>pump action of the Chromelodeon.  Yes, the &quot;pain&quot; that Partch shows with the<br/>physical exertion of playing the Chromelodeon in video clips is admittedly<br/>not the same, but at the same time isn&apos;t the only point of focus in a piece<br/>like Barstow.  For the Diamond Marimba part, I built an electronic DM in the<br/>same layout using force sensors as the bars.  The signals were mapped to<br/>MIDI through Max and then triggered specially tuned marimba samples in a<br/>S2000 sampler. The Boo was emulated with 3 MalletKats setup in a pyramid.  I<br/>had one 3 octave Kat at the base, a 2 octave Kat behind it and a 1 octave<br/>Kat behind the 2 octave one.  The bars were mapped in Max to another S2000<br/>sampler with specially tuned bamboo samples.  Only for the Boo did I have to<br/>translate the original score to fit the MalletKat layout.  In every case of<br/>the instruments, the playing technique and sounds were kept as similar as<br/>possible to the original instruments.   The sculpture student even built a<br/>stand for the DM and the SK inspired after Partch&apos;s real instruments to make<br/>the instruments visually compelling as well.  I didn&apos;t stop there in my<br/>realization of the piece.<br/> For the performance we all dressed up in costume as hobos.  I assigned the<br/>non-chorus voice parts to one solo performer who acted out each of scene.<br/>The result was in my opinion a very theatrical and very corporeal<br/>performance of Barstow.  Some on this list will damn me, others will support<br/>me.  It doesn&apos;t matter.  Everyone involved and who was in the audience was<br/>extremely moved by the power of Partch&apos;s music and will remember it for a<br/>long time.  I know I will.  This performance of Barstow was so much closer<br/>to a live experience by NewBand or the Partch Ensemble as compared to<br/>listening to a CD which is the way most of the people on this list have<br/>experienced Barstow.  I think it was definitely worth the effort.</p><p>Alex Ruthmann</p><p>&gt; Message: 1<br/>&gt; Date: Tue, 18 Jul 2000 09:56:43 EDT<br/>&gt; From: <a href="mailto:Afmmjr@aol.com">Afmmjr@aol.com</a><br/>&gt; Subject: Electric Partch<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Jon S. wrote:<br/>&gt;&gt; You need to do more reading, because &quot;pioneered the concept of<br/>&gt; electronics&quot; is a &gt;  bit of a stretch.  IMHO.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Partch wrote in 1967 to Allen Strange (page 410 of Enclosures 3):<br/>&gt; &quot;The  winter of 1937-38 I heard both electronic music and common sounds<br/>&gt; music, recorded on acetate records, by a young man in Los Angeles (he later<br/>&gt; became Schonberg&apos;s secretary).  It was a new, fresh idea, and I was<br/>&gt; enchanted.  I think I can say flatly that I was the only musician who gave<br/>&gt; the man any encouragement.  But he got nowhere with his ideas.  Eighteen<br/>&gt; years later a group in Paris became famous from New York to California for<br/>&gt; doing exactly the same thing, not as well, in my opinion.  Then Columbia and<br/>&gt; Princeton wanted to do something similar and went to Rockefeller.  They did<br/>&gt; not say: Los Angeles has done it, therefore it must be good.  They said,<br/>&gt; Paris and Milan and Cologne have done it, therefore it must be good.  When I<br/>&gt; am pointed out as the Anti Man I hope that someone will add that I am<br/>&gt; probably the first musician in the United States of America to give solid<br/>&gt; encouragement to both electronic music and common-sounds music.  H.P. &quot;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Since Otto Luening&apos;s introduction of electronic music on television in<br/>&gt; 1952 is being celebrated at Lincoln Center in its current electronic music<br/>&gt; festival as the real start for electronic music, it seems increasingly<br/>&gt; reasonable to consider Harry Partch a pioneer in electronic concepts.  It<br/>&gt; also may make one reconsider the use of an electronic &quot;chromelodeon&quot; in<br/>&gt; contemporary performance, as well.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Elsewhere (p. 401 of Enclosures 3) Partch further amplified his thoughts<br/>&gt; on the issue of electronics in a San Francisco publication &quot;Truth-In-Music&quot;:<br/>&gt; &quot;I&apos;m against total electronic music and I don&apos;t believe it will catch on<br/>&gt; totally in the future.  Philosophically, there is magic in anything you<br/>&gt; touch, be it a string, a piece of bamboo or an electron tube.&quot;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Johnny Reinhard<br/>&gt; AFMM</p></div>
