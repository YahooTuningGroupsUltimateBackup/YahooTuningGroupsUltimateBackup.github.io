I&apos;ve become an expert in the theory and practice of carving marimba keys, and also I&apos;ve been helping Daniel Schmidt make American-style gamelan keys out of aluminum. With just a mill and a band saw you can completely control several of the lowest-frequency relevant modes of the spectrum (which is basically four modes - the fundamental, two overtones, and the first lateral mode). If you want to make other wacky shapes besides rectangular bars I can help you tune their modes as well.</p><p>I wouldn&apos;t recommend reading a book with lots of math if all you want to do is tune the modes. The math is beautiful and nice to understand, but pretty irrelevant for actually making keys. When you make a key you don&apos;t spend a bunch of time doing calculations (which would be hopelessly inaccurate anyway unless you&apos;re using sophisticated software); instead you spend the time measuring the frequencies of the different modes and then removing material in a feedback process.</p><p>Here&apos;s the best description I&apos;ve found of the modes of a key that are relevant to its sound, and how to tune them: <a href="http://www.lafavre.us/tuning-marimba.htm">http://www.lafavre.us/tuning-marimba.htm</a> It&apos;s written with wooden keys in mind, but it applies equally well to aluminum. The different stiffness and density will change the absolute frequencies for a given shape and size of key, but the mode shapes and how to tune them are no different.</p><p>Keenan</p></div><h3><a id=104936 href="#104936">ðŸ”—</a>Chris Vaisvil &#x3C;chrisvaisvil@...&#x3E;</h3><span>8/21/2012 7:10:39 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Hi Keenan - that is a very interesting reference.</p><p>Let me post pictures tomorrow of my DOA piece of aluminum and see if it can<br/>be saved.</p><p>Chris</p><p>On Tue, Aug 21, 2012 at 7:32 PM, Keenan Pepper &lt;keenanpepper@...&gt;wrote:</p><p>&gt; **<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; --- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, Chris Vaisvil &lt;chrisvaisvil@...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; Hello all,<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; Through a friend I have access to a metal working shop that mostly deals<br/>&gt; &gt; with aluminum - especially chunks of it.
