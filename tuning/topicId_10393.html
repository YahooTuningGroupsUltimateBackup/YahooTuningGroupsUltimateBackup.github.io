(p _ 1)^2)/p<br/>i&apos;m unsure what the &apos;.&apos; and the &apos;_&apos; are in that formula though.<br/>is the &apos;_&apos; is a typo for &apos;-&apos;?</p><p>the barlow metric (distance between two ratios x and y) is said to be<br/>D(x,y) = 2 . ISUFC(i=1,n, |xi _ yi| . F(((pi _ 1)^2,pi))<br/>this formula uses terms defined elsewhere in the URL, but has<br/>HMSL code i don&apos;t understand (what is &apos;ISUFC&apos;?), and also seems<br/>to have potential typos (&apos;.&apos;?  &apos;_&apos;?).  there is also a code example<br/>of the barlow metric used on a group of ratios (instead of just<br/>two), but it&apos;s just as confusing to me.  so i&apos;m quite lost on<br/>understanding the barlow metric...</p><p>another metric described that i have difficulty grasping is the<br/>&apos;harmonic metric&apos;.  this is &quot;an original function that attempts to<br/>find closeness of one pitch in the lattice to a presumed harmonic<br/>series.  the fundamental of the series is presumed to be the ratio<br/>expressed by the minima of all dimensions&quot;.  this is shown in HMSL<br/>code as D(x) = ISUFC(i=0,n, wi . |xi _ min(xi)|)<br/>and D(L) = ISUFC(j=0,m, D(xj))<br/>but i am at a loss to understand; what is the &apos;minima of all<br/>dimensions&apos; in a lattice?</p><p>finally, the notes in this URL end with some unrealized ideas.<br/>one is the idea that a lattice space could be realized as a<br/>continuous rather than discrete space (allowing, i suppose,<br/>irrational numbers in addition to rational ones).  in a<br/>continuous space you could move around harmonically by<br/>&apos;gliding&apos; rather than using discrete steps in pitch.<br/>i&apos;m curious if anyone has tried this or has any thoughts on it.</p><p>thanks!  pfly</p></div>
