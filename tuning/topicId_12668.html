I wrote the following originally to Patrick Mullen,<br/>off-list.  The acronym COFT stands for &quot;Calculated Optimum Fixed<br/>Tuning&quot;.</p><p>First, about my general &quot;spring&quot; model.  It is an analog of the physical<br/>world; there, springs behave as follows: resisting force is proportional<br/>to displacement times spring constant.  The energy held by a spring is<br/>the integral of force over distance of displacement, which works out to<br/>being proportional to the SQUARE of displacement.</p><p>In my model, energy is the analog of &quot;pain&quot;, refering to the displeasure<br/>of our ears to out-of-tune intervals (chords being represented in this<br/>model as a set of dyads, with some awareness of otonal vs. utonal<br/>chords).  Displacement is the analog of tuning motion, with the &quot;rest&quot;<br/>point being exact JI.</p><p>By setting up a big spring matrix and relaxing it successively, I can<br/>minimize &quot;pain&quot; and hope to approach a nicely tuned piece (it can be<br/>shown that minimum energy is equivalent to each node of the matrix<br/>relaxing fully; i.e., having zero net force).  For each sequence read<br/>into the program, I create three kinds of springs:</p><p>   . to control tuning, I create springs between notes of different<br/>     pitches which sound together.  I call these &quot;vertical&quot; springs.</p><p>   . to control the pain of a note changing pitch (especially while<br/>     the note is sounding!), I create &quot;horizontal&quot; springs between<br/>     successive instances of the same pitch.</p><p>   . to control drift of the entire piece&apos;s tuning over time, I create<br/>     &quot;grounding&quot; springs between each note and some ideal expectation<br/>     of the tuning of that note.  For that ideal I&apos;ve used 12-tET, but<br/>     more recently have let the ideal &quot;float&quot; to any constant value<br/>     (constant over the duration of the sequence, that is).  This last<br/>     is closely aligned with the &quot;COFT&quot; value.</p><p>There&apos;s more, of course: a minor third in 12-tET is either 6/5 or 7/6,<br/>and a major second has three possible JI values (10/9, 9/8, or 8/7).<br/>And, even a major third might be 9/7 rather than 5/4!  A part of the<br/>program that is not always fully ideal at the moment makes the<br/>decision about what JI intervals to shoot for in setting up the<br/>vertical intervals in the spring matrix.  At present, I do not modify<br/>the target tuning of a spring once it is created.</p><p>Now COFT.  If the tuning of a piece is fixed, then two of the<br/>three spring types disappear: horizontal motion within a pitch is<br/>gone, so the value of those springs is of no importance.  Grounding<br/>becomes a non-issue, because drift is impossible with a fixed tuning,<br/>and any tuning can be moved in absolute tuning space so that average<br/>deflection is zero (or, notes are tuned only down from 12-tET, or<br/>whatever...).  So the &quot;only&quot; thing left to worry about is to sum the<br/>values of all the vertical springs and then relax them to the least pain<br/>position.</p><p>I now attach an actual table output for one of the pieces on my web site</p><p>   <a href="http://www.adaptune.com">http://www.adaptune.com</a></p><p>(a piece which works particularly well in COFT), Mozart&apos;s Andante<br/>f&uuml;r Orgelwalze,  K.616, sequence by Hans Jakob Heldstab.  The piece<br/>is in the key of F major.  This is a 5-limit target tuning; COFT for<br/>7-limit tunings is problematical.</p><p>How to read the table: each record shows a pair of pitches, along with<br/>their final tuning, in cents relative to 12-tET.  The strength field<br/>is an integral of loudness over time of that pair of pitches sounding<br/>in the sequence (with some adjustment for less important intervals).<br/>Ideal should tend to show a quasi-JI tuning for this interval (quasi<br/>only because sometimes different interpretations of the interval<br/>conflict to some extent in the composite shown).  Actual reflects the<br/>tunings chosen for the two notes.  Force is the means of communicating<br/>urgency of request, and is Strength times the difference of Actual and<br/>Ideal; the force for all intervals of each note adds to zero because the<br/>spring set has been relaxed to a state of minimum energy (&quot;pain&quot;).  The<br/>Pain column is proportional to (Ideal - Actual) squared times strength.</p><p>In this table 0 == C, 1 == C# and/or Db, etc.  Note that the interval<br/>most strongly represented is C to E (0 to 4), the fifth degree and the<br/>leading tone, with strength 451.285.  That either is or is not<br/>surprising...</p><p>A reformulation of the relationships among the columns:</p><p>   Force =       Strength * (Actual - Ideal)<br/>   Pain  = 0.5 * Strength * (Actual - Ideal)^2</p><p>Which implies,</p><p>   Pain / Force = 0.5 * (Actual - Ideal)</p><p>   Pain = Force * 0.5 * (Actual - Ideal)<br/>   Pain = Force *       (Actual - Ideal) / 2.0</p><p>Ptch Tuning Ptch

I&apos;ll use the first part of this post as a separate<br/>definition for &apos;spring&apos;, which I also need in the Dictionary<br/>... unless you feel the need to write a definition specifically<br/>for &apos;spring&apos;.  The second part will be the definition for &apos;COFT&apos;.</p><p>&gt; Now COFT.  If the tuning of a piece is fixed, then two of the<br/>&gt; three spring types disappear: horizontal motion within a pitch<br/>&gt; is gone, so the value of those springs is of no importance.<br/>&gt; Grounding becomes a non-issue, because drift is impossible with<br/>&gt; a fixed tuning, and any tuning can be moved in absolute tuning<br/>&gt; space so that average deflection is zero (or, notes are tuned<br/>&gt; only down from 12-tET, or whatever...).  So the &quot;only&quot; thing left<br/>&gt; to worry about is to sum the values of all the vertical springs<br/>&gt; and then relax them to the least pain position.</p><p>Hmmm... unless I&apos;m misunderstanding something, you might want<br/>to rethink some of the absolutes you&apos;re seeing here.  It&apos;s<br/>apparent to me that you&apos;re only considering 12-note fixed tunings.<br/>A fixed tuning with many more notes can certainly lead to drift.<br/>I&apos;m thinking here of, say, 53-tET (maybe even 31-tET?).</p><p>The 53-tET step-size is a &apos;mean comma&apos; that gives a good<br/>approximation of both the Pythagorean and syntonic commas, and<br/>I could forsee lots of drift.

Feedback appreciated.</p><p>As it happens, I&apos;m aware of the wonderful properties of 53-tET.</p><p>[Paul E:]<br/>&gt;Monz, in this context, fixed means &quot;only one pitch per pitch-class&quot; or<br/>&gt;better yet, &quot;only one pitch per notated note-name&quot;. So if you&apos;re<br/>&gt;playing a diatonic piece in 53-tET, 53-tET would not be considered a<br/>&gt;fixed tuning, if you use both degree 8 and degree 9 for the note &quot;D&quot;.</p><p>&gt;Although it is true that John&apos;s program so far only handles 12-note<br/>&gt;fixed tunings, there is nothing in his concept that prevents it from<br/>&gt;being adapted to tunings with more notes, AS LONG AS ALL THE NOTES ARE<br/>&gt;NOTATED DIFFERENTLY. The only reason it stops at 12 now is because all<br/>&gt;the MIDI files he&apos;s been retuning have only 12 pitch classes, and<br/>&gt;contain no way of distinguishing , say, G# from Ab, even if the<br/>&gt;composer originally made these distinctions in the score. If MIDI files<br/>&gt;did contain these distinctions, John would calculate COFTs with<br/>&gt;_different_ values for G# and Ab, and hence fixed tunings with more<br/>&gt;than 12 notes. I&apos;ll let John expound on enhancements to his program<br/>&gt;that he may forsee for the future . . .</p><p>Monz, my original purpose in breaking out COFT values from the spring<br/>adaptive model was with the idea of tuning a 12-note fixed-pitch<br/>instrument (piano?  harpsichord?) for a performance of a particular<br/>piece.</p><p>Since then, Paul, Margo, and others have made the point, as you do,<br/>that it would make sense to calculate COFT values for more than 12<br/>notes per octave.  David Keenan, as you undoubtedly know, is also a<br/>major proponent of G#/Ab (etc.) distinctions, and has even written code<br/>to split out notes, given 12-tone input.</p><p>I&apos;m part way through writing code that will (I hope some day) accomplish<br/>this.  I&apos;m having problems with it going crazy, specifying movement of<br/>fifths that is clearly excessive.  I&apos;m using a 31-tET model, my own<br/>choice, but also recommended by others.  Understand, the 31-tET model is<br/>a computational convenience; what&apos;s really taking place is a tracking of<br/>fifths in the extended circle that will yield a set of notes &gt; 12 but<br/>reasonable in number, for an enhanced COFT calculation.  Where these<br/>notes are actually tuned is independent of 31-tET, though it might<br/>track it fairly closely for some sequences, depending upon their<br/>distribution of intervals!

Alma tries to hold back her tears and<br/>   accept her fate stoically, but she is heartbroken, and altho she<br/>   loves him and submits to his demand, she will remain bitter about<br/>   this sacrifice for the rest of her years with Mahler.</p><p>Arggh!!

But tying together the different life stories on one<br/>chronology really starts to bring out the connections.</p><p>&gt; Mahler may be a musical genius, but as a human being, he&apos;s<br/>&gt; pretty pathetic.</p><p>This position can be defended by stating the facts of Mahler&apos;s<br/>life, but it would have to be very much a one-sided presentation.<br/>I&apos;m sorry if this impression is conveyed too strongly by my<br/>webpage, but it&apos;s a result of the terseness to which I tried<br/>to limit myself, in order that the damned thing wouldn&apos;t get too<br/>ridiculously big.</p><p>The reason we Mahler fans find him so interesting is that his<br/>was an extremely complex personality, full of contradictions.<br/>He was a truly warm-hearted human being, full of sincere concern<br/>for his fellow-man (the opening sentence of Schoenberg&apos;s<br/>memorial dedication in his _Harmonielehre_ is: &quot;Gustav Mahler<br/>was a saint.&quot;).  At the same time, he was a cold and ruthlessly<br/>calculating career opportunist, who could walk over anyone<br/>who got in his way.</p><p>As I state on my webpage, while it&apos;s true that Mahler forbade<br/>Alma to continue composing at the time they married, an affair<br/>she had 8 years later finally woke Mahler up to the neglect<br/>to which he subjected her, and he gleefully began listening to<br/>her songs and subsequently encouraged her to publish them.</p><p>So in response to:</p><p>&gt; Arggh!!  Who knows what we have missed?  (end of O.T.)</p><p>The answer is: the songs are out there.  They&apos;ve been published,<br/>performed, and recorded (altho I&apos;ve never heard them myself).</p><p>There&apos;s a new movie just being put in the can, _Bride of the Wind_.<br/>Due out soon, it&apos;s about Alma, and of course features Mahler and<br/>his music too.</p><p>Alma&apos;s diary was published in English in abridged form last year,<br/>and is very fascinating reading indeed.  It covers her last<br/>teenage years and those up to her marriage to Mahler.</p><p>&gt;<br/>&gt; As for the sequence: it&apos;d have to be tuned by hand, I assume,<br/>&gt; to be true to Schoenberg&apos;s ideas?

He *did* mention the possibility<br/>of other ETs and also &apos;untempered&apos; (i.e., JI) music in his<br/>_Harmonielehre_, but lamented that there were too few instruments<br/>capable of playing these other tunings, and so until those<br/>instruments were widely available, the only practical recourse<br/>was to wring new harmonies out of 12-tET.</p><p>The logic and force of his arguments proved strong enough to<br/>play a big part in ensuring the adoption of 12-tET in much of<br/>the Euro-/Americo-centric music world for much of the 1900s.<br/>But I think we&apos;ve finally broken out of that box...</p><p>-monz<br/><a href="http://www.ixpres.com/interval/monzo/homepage.html">http://www.ixpres.com/interval/monzo/homepage.html</a></p></div><h3><a id=12854 href="#12854">ðŸ”—</a>Joseph Pehrson &#x3C;josephpehrson@compuserve.com&#x3E;</h3><span>9/16/2000 5:04:26 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@egroups.com">tuning@egroups.com</a>, &quot; Monz&quot; &lt;MONZ@J...&gt; wrote:<br/><a href="http://www.egroups.com/message/tuning/12849">http://www.egroups.com/message/tuning/12849</a></p><p>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; As for the sequence: it&apos;d have to be tuned by hand, I assume,<br/>&gt; &gt; to be true to Schoenberg&apos;s ideas?
