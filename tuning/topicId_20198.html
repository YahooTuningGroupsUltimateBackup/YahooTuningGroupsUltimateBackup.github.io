The book is a<br/>compilation of avant-garde score excerpts, charts and diagrams, stills<br/>from Lumia and other types of abstract video, even a few playbills, etc.<br/>--virtually of any type of graphic art that relates to music. The<br/>overall effect is simply stunning.</p><p>Erv Wilson and I are represented by couple of pages each of lattices and<br/>diagrams. Mine are pretty much what Joe Monzo (who is mentioned as well)<br/>has posted on the web pages he set up for me at the Sonic Arts site.<br/>Some of Erv&apos;s are also on the Anaphoria site, but I&apos;m not sure all are.</p><p>--John</p></div>
