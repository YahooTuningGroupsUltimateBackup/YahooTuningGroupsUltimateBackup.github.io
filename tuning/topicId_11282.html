Even the wooden xylophones<br/>of Africa approach 5-tET and 7-tET.</p><p>Carl wrote,</p><p>&gt;&gt;Perhaps the range of a &quot;fifth&quot; is better than most here, but many other<br/>&gt;generators do produce proper scales with reasonable number of tones.  And<br/>&gt;&gt;the fact that the fifth has been a historically popular generator isn&apos;t<br/>&gt;&gt;really explained its utility here, since a given culture usually uses only<br/>&gt;&gt;a single scale.  Western music is overwhelmingly diatonic, for example.<br/>&gt;&gt;Why not use one of the proper MOSs of the minor third?  And, as you<br/>pointed<br/>&gt;&gt;out, Rothenberg&apos;s model does not imply that improper scales are &quot;bad&quot;.</p><p>Jason wrote,</p><p>&gt;Not &quot;bad&quot; but definitely &quot;bad for a fugue.&quot;  I&apos;m not undertanding your<br/>&gt;point on how the fact that a given culture sticks to a single scale applies<br/>&gt;here.  If certain scales work better than others given certain other<br/>&gt;stylistic traits of the music, then certainly a stylistically coherent<br/>&gt;music will often use only one scale, if it significantly better than others<br/>&gt;in some respects.  You&apos;re definitely correct, however, that the<br/>&gt;characteristics I&apos;m looking at are too weak to explain the use of the 5th<br/>&gt;as a generator.</p><p>Perhaps what Carl means is, if the music overwhelmingly uses just 7 notes in<br/>the chain, what relevance could the properties of the chain, when extended<br/>out to 50 or 81 notes, possibly have to the music?</p></div>
