As a person who, as a youth, used to carry<br/>around Stravinsky&apos;s _Mass_, at all times, I will agree that it seems<br/>that &quot;context&quot; is everything.  The final chord of the &quot;Sanctus&quot; with the<br/>dominant 7th and the 11th in it really wants to &quot;stay put.&quot;</p><p>It makes me think that much of this &quot;consonance,&quot; &quot;concordance&quot; business<br/>is really psychological... a matter of composer and cultural<br/>conditioning.  This is a topic that Margo Schulter seems to be bringing<br/>up all the time.</p><p>A set of compositional considerations can actually CREATE and enforce<br/>stasis even in a dominant-7th chord in 12-tET, seemingly.</p><p>Correspondingly, the &quot;biases&quot; that Ms. Schulter cites regarding cultural<br/>norms in chords come clearly into play.  It is not hard to believe that<br/>someone who is conditioned to hear 5-limit, 3 or 4 note chords would<br/>reject 3-limit chords stating... well, that&apos;s not really a chord, it&apos;s<br/>&quot;only&quot; counterpoint!<br/>____________ ______ __ __ _<br/>Joseph Pehrson</p></div>
