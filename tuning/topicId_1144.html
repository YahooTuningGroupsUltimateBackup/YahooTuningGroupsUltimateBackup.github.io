I play bass (looking into getting</p><p>&gt;a fretless to explore all intonations), and I have a good singer that<br/>&gt;I&apos;m working with.</p><p>I&apos;m a guitarist/keyboardist living in Somerville and I&apos;ve been playing<br/>22-tone whenever I have a break from 12-tone. Let&apos;s jam.</p></div>
