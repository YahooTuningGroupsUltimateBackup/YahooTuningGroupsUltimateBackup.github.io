His experiment has<br/>a SEPARATE CHORD for every single .mp3 file!  No problems with<br/>voice-leading there!</p><p>I don&apos;t know why it is taking <a href="http://mp3.com">mp3.com</a> so long to get the experiment &quot;up<br/>and running.&quot; It is not yet ready... one important file has not yet been<br/>&quot;approved.&quot;  I am investigating this.  I assume it will all be resolved<br/>by mid-week next week at the latest.</p><p>I was a little confused by your own experiment and comments.  I didn&apos;t<br/>find anyplace where there was an explanation of exactly what chords and<br/>tunings you were using.  Is there something I was missing??</p><p>Also, I found it a little confounding that you were criticizing the idea<br/>of progression in terms of assessing tuning and, yet, in your own<br/>examples there are nothing BUT progressions.(??)  I&apos;m a little<br/>mystified.</p><p>As to the following:</p><p>&gt; Suppose that we agree that there is some significance in the<br/>&gt;dualistic analysis (o-/u-tonality) of the V7-like chords. The<br/>&gt;question arises whether it is important that the root of G#-C-D#-F#<br/>&gt;is then A# (the lowest common overtone).</p><p>I have no answer yet to this question.  In fact, Paul, could you please<br/>explain what is meant by the question??  That might help.</p><p>Thanks, George, for your interest, and for your own experiment.  Please<br/>inform me as to where I can find the accompanying documentation.</p><p>It was also nice that you were able to include a silouhette of Banaphshu<br/>as background for your page.</p><p>Thanks again!</p><p>__________ _______ ___ _ _<br/>Joseph Pehrson</p></div><h3>George Kahrimanis &#x3C;anakreon@hol.gr&#x3E;</h3><span>8/12/2000 1:42:20 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>New though I am in the list, I have noticed that you are quite a teaser, Joseph.</p><p>&gt; a silouhette of Banaphshu as background for your page</p><p>Joseph Pehrson wrote:<br/>&gt;  you were criticizing the idea<br/>&gt; of progression in terms of assessing tuning and, yet, in your own<br/>&gt; examples there are nothing BUT progressions.</p><p>That is, if you study _progressions_, fine. But if you study isolated<br/>chords, any _spurious_ progressions just _might_ affect your results.</p><p>&gt; I didn&apos;t find anyplace where there was an explanation of exactly<br/>&gt; what chords and tunings you were using.  Is there something I was missing?</p><p>I was planning to post that info in about a week, after the participants<br/>would have a chance to respond, without prejudice, on how they compare the<br/>tuning in a1 _vs_ that in a2, in b1 _vs_ b2, and so on.</p><p>I wrote<br/>&gt; &gt; Suppose that we agree that there is some significance in the<br/>&gt; &gt;dualistic analysis (o-/u-tonality) of the V7-like chords.

For _your_ sake he &apos;d better reply,<br/>else I threaten to come back with my own explanation.</p><p>I am having fun surfing the waves in the Tuning List, but I think that<br/>I should get to the reason of my subscribing, to consult y&apos; all about the<br/>importance of the 11th harmonic in Western Musical practice, especially<br/>in relation to the augmented triad. I was planning to post a more detailed<br/>set of questions, but I manage to get distracted (like seduced) every<br/>time I go through the list messages.</p><p>Thank you for the comments (waiting for ther results, too -- no tricks, please)<br/>- George Kahrimanis    <a href="mailto:anakreon@hol.gr">anakreon@hol.gr</a></p></div><h3>Paul Erlich &#x3C;PERLICH@ACADIAN-ASSET.COM&#x3E;</h3><span>8/13/2000 1:51:34 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@egroups.com">tuning@egroups.com</a>, Joseph Pehrson &lt;josephpehrson@c...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt; As to the following:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; Suppose that we agree that there is some significance in the<br/>&gt; &gt;dualistic analysis (o-/u-tonality) of the V7-like chords. The<br/>&gt; &gt;question arises whether it is important that the root of G#-C-D#-F#<br/>&gt; &gt;is then A# (the lowest common overtone).<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I have no answer yet to this question.  In fact, Paul, could you<br/>please<br/>&gt; explain what is meant by the question??  That might help.</p><p>Remember our discussions about utonal chords (you might want to go<br/>back to our posts to refresh your memory). So in a meantone tuning<br/>(like 31-tone equal temperament), which is what George is using, the<br/>chord G#-C-D#-F# would approximate a 1/9:1/7:1/6:1/5 chord -- a<br/>utonal<br/>chord. Now according to Partch&apos;s or any other dualistic theory, the<br/>&quot;root&quot; of this chord is the note 1/1 which is the lowest common<br/>overtone (or its octave equivalents, 1/2 or 1/4 or 1/8) and<br/>corresponds, in this temperament, to the note A#.</p><p>Now I&apos;ll draw on my knowledge from discussions with George a couple<br/>of<br/>years ago. The question George is trying to address with his research<br/>is whether the note A# is somehow relevant to the harmonic function<br/>of<br/>this chord, particularly _in a progression_; in particular, does the<br/>chord, when tuned this way, participate more easily in progressions<br/>that involve other chords whose &quot;roots&quot; (perhaps utonal, perhaps<br/>otonal) are consonant (in meantone) with A# than with chords whose<br/>&quot;roots&quot; are not?</p></div>
