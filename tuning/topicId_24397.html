It might even become a lifelong friend. I&apos;ve found the<br/>possibilities for composition to be very exciting. I started in the world of music on guitar about<br/>the same age as you and I wish I had known about microtonality and just intonation then.</p><p>Best Wishes.</p></div><h3><a id=24430 href="#24430">ðŸ”—</a>Paul Erlich &#x3C;paul@stretch-music.com&#x3E;</h3><span>6/6/2001 1:44:43 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Just wanted to say hello to you, Nikita, and make you feel welcome on<br/>this list.
