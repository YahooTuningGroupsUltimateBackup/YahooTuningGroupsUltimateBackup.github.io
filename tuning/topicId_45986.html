What Twining has<br/>created is a piece that pitch cueing for live performance-- this isn&apos;t a first (for the<br/>first American recording of Boulez&apos;s Le Marteau, the soprano was cued on<br/>headphones with a celesta!). I found this quote especially interesting: &quot;All complete<br/>performances of the Requiem so far have been done with the singers wearing<br/>headphones to hear the synth guide tracks.&quot; I&apos;m wondering if this piece could be done<br/>with no click tracks and no synth guides for pitch cues. It seems like, no matter how<br/>expert a choir gets at singing this way, there is going to be an inevitable loss of<br/>ensemble feel. Plus, it&apos;s hard to get over the feeling that &quot;hey...those guys are<br/>cheating!&quot; -- even when the piece is extremely difficult. It seems weird that anyone<br/>would set out to write a JI piece for live performers with the understanding that live<br/>performers can&apos;t really pull it off without help-- this could be a major obstacle to<br/>performances of the piece by other ensembles, but I&apos;m guessing that&apos;s not Twining&apos;s<br/>goal. To my mind, when JI is applied to live performance, it&apos;s supposed to simplify the<br/>ground rules of tuning by appealing to natural law and aural facility. It&apos;s one thing to<br/>write a devilish extended JI piece for digital instruments, but quite a different matter<br/>when acoustic players/singers are involved. But who knows, maybe someday all<br/>sngers will have the training to sing the Twining Requiem without cues (some humor<br/>intended)... I do agree that the Twining Requiem is an amazing accomplishment--<br/>and the interdependence of the music on the electronic cueing makes the<br/>experience of the piece very &apos;postmodern&apos;, a term I use in a positive sense. -Justin</p><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, Carl Lumma &lt;ekin@l...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt; For those of you, like me, who are wondering &quot;How did he do it!!??&quot;,<br/>&gt; we have this info from Mark Johnson, the engineer for Chrysalid<br/>&gt; Requiem...<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; <a href="http://www.panix.com/~mj/reqrec.html">http://www.panix.com/~mj/reqrec.html</a><br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Here&apos;s an article about CR based on the above info...<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; <a href="http://www.garyeskow.com/interviews/inter8p1.html">http://www.garyeskow.com/interviews/inter8p1.html</a><br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; ...a Grammy nomination??!!

What<br/>about the 11-limit? There&apos;s probably a cut-off point where the music becomes<br/>incomprehensible in a folk tradition, especially when the system begins generating<br/>numerous intervals that could potentially compete for the same function (e.g.,<br/>subminor vs. minor third). Contemporary higher-limit JI developments since Partch<br/>represent an important artistic tradition, but not a folk tradition. If the &apos;people&apos; can&apos;t<br/>find the notes intuitively, the tradition will always remain hyperspecialized and won&apos;t<br/>infiltrate the general artistic culture.</p><p>Of course, by those criteria, it&apos;s amazing that 12tet ever emerged, but the piano and<br/>its proto-ilk are to blame (along with other factors, I know). I&apos;d argue that 12tet is<br/>STILL not truly in practical use in Western music, but that&apos;s another thread. -Justin</p><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, Carl Lumma &lt;ekin@l...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt; &gt;I&apos;m wondering if this piece could be done with no click tracks<br/>&gt; &gt;and no synth guides for pitch cues.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Toby feels that with more rehearsal it could.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;It seems like, no matter how expert a choir gets at singing this<br/>&gt; &gt;way, there is going to be an inevitable loss of ensemble feel.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Yep.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;Plus, it&apos;s hard to get over the feeling that &quot;hey...those guys<br/>&gt; &gt;are cheating!&quot; -- even when the piece is extremely difficult.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; It is cheating, but it&apos;s not just difficult -- you&apos;re attempting<br/>&gt; to perform in a musical culture that doesn&apos;t exist.
