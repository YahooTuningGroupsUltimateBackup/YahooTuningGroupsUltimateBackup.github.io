At the change of the millennium, polyphony was<br/>introduced in Western music, however it was still largely vocal,<br/>particularly in the altus and superius voices, each tuning to the sustained<br/>tenor.</p><p>In the Renaissance, often called the &quot;Golden Age of A Cappella,&quot; it would<br/>seem that &quot;ear&quot; tuning was still basic. The only keyboards around at that<br/>time, I believe, were rich man&apos;s toys (virginals, clavichords, etc.) and<br/>probably were not involved in the very complex and chromatic madrigals of<br/>the late Renaissance.</p><p>The important event of the early Baroque period was the &quot;revolution&quot; toward<br/>homophonic texture, largely due to the incorporation of the harpsichord (and<br/>organ) in the &quot;new style&quot; (as Monteverdi called it). By the middle of the<br/>seventeenth century, instrumental music flourished, largely because of the<br/>invention of the sweet sounding and incredibly flexible violin. This must<br/>have created quite a dilemma for music makers--whether to let the strings<br/>tune to each other or confine these young stallions to the tuning &quot;corral&quot;<br/>of the problematic keyboards. What would you have done? (As you can see, I<br/>don&apos;t necessarily place a lot of stock in what historians say. They (like<br/>me) often tend to approach a subject from a &quot;point of view.&quot;)</p><p>&gt;  Even in the<br/>&gt; century before Monteverdi, the triadic language was to some extent<br/>&gt; predicated on the compromises of meantone -- see Blackwood&apos;s book.<br/>&gt; Jerry, if this issue interests you (and since you are an author), I<br/>&gt; suggest you at least read Daniel Wolf&apos;s recent, and Margo Schulter&apos;s<br/>&gt; forthcoming, comments on this issue.</p><p>I&apos;m sure you are right, and I will put these readings on my long list of<br/>pressing things to do. At least I should know what these folks have to say.<br/>Clearly, you value their contributions and that speaks loudly to me.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Particularly interesting for you, though on a slightly different<br/>&gt; topic, would be for you to read the comments of musicians in various<br/>&gt; decades of the 18th century on the issue of temperament. Many of them<br/>&gt; were clearly as attuned to the tuning practices of their time as you<br/>&gt; are to those of today, and reading their reactions, and the way their<br/>&gt; reactions change between the 1720s and 1750s may force you to<br/>&gt; reconsider your apparent assumption about the level of ignorance with<br/>&gt; respect to tuning that existed among musicians at that time.<br/>&gt; Jorgenson&apos;s big book _Tuning_ contains a few enlightening quotes along<br/>&gt; these lines.</p><p>I didn&apos;t mean that I think historical musicians were unaware of tuning<br/>issues. I simply think that there would have been many, like many musicians<br/>today, who understood the theory and then did what they &quot;heard.&quot; I have<br/>observed, in many arenas of life, that what people _think they do is not<br/>always _what they do.</p><p>I&apos;m not saying the authorities you cite are &quot;wrong.&quot; I simply am filtering<br/>the ideas through my own first-hand observations of &quot;real life.&quot; I think<br/>that is what an &quot;education&quot; is all about. On topics of which I have little<br/>experience, I&apos;ll believe anything.</p><p>Thanks for the suggested readings. I&apos;ll do my best to get to them.</p><p>Jerry</p></div>
