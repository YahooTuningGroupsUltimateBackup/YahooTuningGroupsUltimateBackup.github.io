It&apos;s finding a way to get them exposed, and<br/>consistently...as we see, the media is totally dedicated to the weakest,<br/>most bland sounding forms of music for the airwaves, and this is not<br/>going to change soon, especially as the media is consolidating more and<br/>more into a few huge conglomerates, controlled by a very few people. As<br/>with microtonal tunings, I have found that once folks even know some<br/>alternatives even exist, half the battle is over. That&apos;s why I<br/>constantly keep the subject of alt tunings very much out in the open<br/>with everyone I chat with. I feel that if the folks on this list, and<br/>others like minded, keep up our forward motion on this front, things<br/>will change for the better.<br/>For example, I have tried to play Dan&apos;s music for as many folks as<br/>possible over the years, and the response has always been<br/>favorable...what would happen if we were &quot;allowed&quot; to hear Stearns on<br/>the commercial stations, next to, say, Metallica? I personaly think a<br/>lot of folks would be intrigued, and want to check it out..but, it&apos;s<br/>that initial exposure that is so difficult.<br/>   As far as trying to put Indian intervals into some sort of<br/>theoretical framework, I don&apos;t believe it can be done in a nice, neat<br/>way...I bet there&apos;s a lot of intuitive tweaking of intervals that<br/>happens in an Indian music performance, just like blues music, and it<br/>will not be possible to nail it down. In fact, one of the most<br/>liberating concepts for me, as I have studied tunings, is realizing that<br/>indeed, Indian, Arabic, and most likely many other musical cultures, are<br/>constantly adjusting the size of intervals, depending on their mood at<br/>the time, etc...so, I don&apos;t worry about exact interval sizes, or a<br/>consistent framework, because it most likely is a very fluid situation,<br/>just like when I bend a string playing blues...it doesn&apos;t always wind up<br/>in the same spot...Hstick</p></div>
