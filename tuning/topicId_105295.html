May be teaching courses by mail<br/>&gt; would solve this problem.</p><p>Dear Mario,</p><p>Please let me report that I have looked into the Piagui tuning,<br/>and cautiously conclude that it is a kind of well-temperament of<br/>a kind much like that described by musicians such as Neidhardt<br/>and Marpurg in the 18th century.</p><p>My purpose here is both to explain my tentative findings to you,<br/>so that you may judge whether these findings fit your actual<br/>scale; and also to explain them to others on the list, so that<br/>they may understanding what Plagui is and what it does -- if I am<br/>correct, that is!</p><p>Above all, this should be a friendly and mutually informative<br/>dialogue. I suspect what has happened is that people have had<br/>problems understanding some of your mathematical concepts leading<br/>to Plagui, when the actual scale is quite simple, and certainly<br/>within the legitimate scope of this group, just as similar<br/>historical well-temperaments would be. My purpose is not to blame<br/>anyone, but to suggest what Piagui may be, and seek your<br/>feedback.</p><p>In my analysis, there are two sizes of semitone in Plagui. The<br/>larger semitone or P is equal to precisely half of a 9/8 tone, or<br/>101.955 cents. This is the meansemitone of 9/8, as it might be<br/>called, famously favored by Henricus Grammateus in 1518, who<br/>showed a geometric method for calculating a precisely equal<br/>division of 9/8 in &quot;an amusing reckoning,&quot; as he called it.</p><p>The smaller semitone or K is equal to (128/81)^(1/8), or<br/>precisely an eighth of a Pythagorean minor sixth at 792.180<br/>cents, or 99.0225 cents.</p><p>The Piagui scale, as I understand, has 8 K plus 4 P to form an<br/>octave of 2/1. This makes sense, since the 4 P will add up to a<br/>Pythagorean major third at 81/64 (407.820 cents), and the 8 K, of<br/>course, to 128/81.</p><p>These 8 K and 4 P might be ordered in various ways, but a version<br/>I saw on a webpage of Chris Vaisvil seems musically logical:<br/>there the pattern is K K K K P P K K K K P P. This has the effect<br/>of yielding a just 4/3 and 16/9 above our 1/1, here taken as C in<br/>the well-tempered circle; and also of yielding above this 1/1 the<br/>best major third from a classical perspective favoring 5/4:<br/>396.090 cents, or 9.776 cents wide.</p><p>&lt;<a href="http://chrisvaisvil.com/?p=564">http://chrisvaisvil.com/?p=564</a>&gt;</p><p>! piaguilike2.scl<br/>!<br/>Like Mario Pizarro&apos;s Piagui: steps of (9/8)^1/2 and (128/81)^1/8<br/> 12<br/>!<br/> 99.02250<br/> 198.04500<br/> 297.06750<br/> 396.09000<br/> 4/3<br/> 600.00000<br/> 699.02250<br/> 798.04500<br/> 897.06750<br/> 16/9<br/> 1098.04500<br/> 2/1</p><p>There are two sizes of fifths, eight at 1/8-Pythagorean comma<br/>narrow of just (699.0225 cents); and four at a just 3/2<br/>(701.955).</p><p>We can also write out this temperament as a circle of fifths,<br/>starting for example from Eb, with 4 fifths at a just 3/2 and the<br/>other 8 at 1/8 Pythagorean comma narrow:</p><p>  -1/8   3/2  3/2 -1/8  -1/8 -1/8 -1/8  3/2  3/2 -1/8  -1/8  -1/8<br/> Eb    Bb    F    C    G    D    A    E    B    F#   C#    G#   D#/Eb<br/>297   996   498   0   699  198  897  396 1098  600   99   798   297</p><p>Also, I might ask if your reference to &quot;624&quot; could be to (9/8)^6,<br/>or a 2/1 octave plus a Pythagorean comma at 531441/524288; and<br/>your &quot;612&quot; to 612 steps to the octave? While these concepts may<br/>have played a role in leading you to Piagui, the system itself<br/>seems a mild well-temperament of a general type well-known to the<br/>18th century.</p><p>This style of temperament might also have some resemblance to the<br/>&quot;Victorian&quot; tunings of the later 19th century, which sought<br/>approximately equal semitones, but with some favoring of the<br/>nearest keys. The K K K K P P K K K K P P generally has this<br/>effect for 5/4, and so could be seen as another variation on<br/>either the earlier Neidhardt and Marpurg temperaments in this<br/>general style, or the Victorian tradition of subtly unequal<br/>semitones and key colors.</p><p>&gt; While I was satisfied with the future of the progression of<br/>&gt; musical cells and despite I explained its interesting<br/>&gt; properties, nobody gave a credit to this proposal. The age of<br/>&gt; the 12 tone scale has not ended, the multiple tone scales will<br/>&gt; not necesarily be the solution.  I don&apos;t know if somebody has<br/>&gt; demonstraded whether not one of the twelve tone scale proposals<br/>&gt; complies with the listeners expectancy.</p><p>Mario, I am delighted to give you credit for the Piagui<br/>well-temperament, and to recognize it as one of a number of<br/>moderate well-temperaments quite close to, but distinct from,<br/>12-EDO, which is how you often describe it.</p><p>Of course, it is possible that on further searching we might find<br/>something identical to it from some 18th-century source, say --<br/>and that would make it an &quot;independent rediscovery,&quot; something<br/>yuu devised in your own right, and later found had been described<br/>earlier. This might be true of almost any tuning: but in any<br/>event, I would call it a mild and subtle well-temperament with<br/>four pure 3/2 fifths and eight tempered at 1/8 Pythagorean comma.</p><p>&gt;  Along my stay in tuning I made some mistakes even in conexion<br/>&gt;  with my personal behavior, somebody should press the reset.</p><p>This is actually a good opportunity for all of us to &quot;press the<br/>reset&quot; by recognizing your tuning as a mild well-temperament, and<br/>approaching it on that basis.</p><p>One thing i would urge you to do, early in your presentations of<br/>Piagui, is to give your Piagui scale in cents, and also the sizes<br/>of the K and P semitones in cents. That way, people can quickly<br/>understand what the actual tuning is. I think that a number of us<br/>had problems understanding the basics of the scale, and this<br/>complicated things a bit.</p><p>Also, I&apos;m not sure how Ramos ties in with Piagui, at least in any<br/>direct way: Henricus Grammateus, Neidhardt, and Marpurg all seem<br/>much more immediately relevant. And we could go back to<br/>Philolaus, as recounted by Boethius, who speculated about<br/>dividing a Pythagorean comma into two equal parts, so that a<br/>literal half-tone or (9/8)^(1/2) would be possible. He correctly<br/>concluded, according to Boethius, that this half-tone would be<br/>equal to a limma or diatonic semitone at 256/243 (90.225 cents),<br/>plus the half-comma (11.730 cents).</p><p>In 1482, Ramos described a just intonation monochord based on<br/>ratios of primes 2, 3, and 5; and a 12-note keyboard very likely<br/>in some form of meantone temperament. He does not, to the best of<br/>my knowledge, discuss any form of equal temperament. Nor does<br/>give any mathematical details on his practical keyboard, although<br/>Mark Lindley has shown why meantone temperament is the logical<br/>conclusion based on the &quot;good&quot; and &quot;bad&quot; thirds and other<br/>intervals which Ramos describes.</p><p>What immediately helped me form my hypothesis as to how Piagui is<br/>tuned was the Scala file at Chris Vaisvil&apos;s site. I could look at<br/>the cents, figure the sizes of the semitones P and K, and then<br/>reasons as to their likely mathematical definition.</p><p>If you discuss Piagui as a well-temperament, then people will be<br/>able either to understand immediately what it is, or at least to<br/>look up well-temperaments and fit yours into the history of<br/>tunings while understanding what some of the advantages and<br/>disadvantages might be.</p><p>Peace and love,</p><p>Margo Schulter</p></div>
