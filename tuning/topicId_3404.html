Apart from<br/>the 342 these all agree very well with the average values in your chart.<br/>Perhaps the singer could not reach 342?</p><p>The second best fit is for the frequencies being multiples of 9.177 Hz</p><p>n       37   36   34   33   30   27   22<br/>Freq   340  330  312  303  275  248  202</p><p>I don&apos;t like this as much as the other one.</p><p>One of these days I will make the program consider fraction ratios also<br/>such as 4/3, 3/2, 9/8 and so on, but at present it solves these by going<br/>way outside the range to a common multiple or divisor.  So the JI scale<br/>would give 24 27 30 32 36 40 45 48 rather than 1 9/8 etc.</p><p>-- Ray Tomes -- <a href="http://www.kcbbs.gen.nz/users/rtomes/rt-home.htm">http://www.kcbbs.gen.nz/users/rtomes/rt-home.htm</a> --<br/>   Cycles email list -- <a href="http://www.kcbbs.gen.nz/users/af/cyc.htm">http://www.kcbbs.gen.nz/users/af/cyc.htm</a><br/>Alexandria eGroup list -- <a href="http://www.kcbbs.gen.nz/users/af/alex.htm">http://www.kcbbs.gen.nz/users/af/alex.htm</a><br/>Boundaries of Science <a href="http://www.kcbbs.gen.nz/users/af/scienceb.htm">http://www.kcbbs.gen.nz/users/af/scienceb.htm</a></p></div>
