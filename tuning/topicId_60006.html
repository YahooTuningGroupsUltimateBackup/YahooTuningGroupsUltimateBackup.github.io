I&apos;m not sure how many of the players are consciously playing in non 12, but there&apos;s a lot of interesting pitches throughout, and most of the guitarists have fresh and non commercial sounding concepts. And, there&apos;s a 6 CD series &quot;The Music of Armenia&quot; on Celestial Harmonies, of which I have the first two, (which feature Armenian choral and Medieval music)...I must say both discs are absolutely beautiful and very deep. I don&apos;t know what traditional Armenian tuning was/is (does somebody here?), and not sure this music is far from 12eq, but man, it&apos;s well worth hearing. It sounds both Western and Eastern at various times, and totally uncontrived...check it out...best...HHH<br/><a href="http://microstick.net">microstick.net</a><br/>PS...there&apos;s a fretless festival in NYC on Sept 11/12 (I think), with a number of the guitarists from the CD playing...</p></div>
