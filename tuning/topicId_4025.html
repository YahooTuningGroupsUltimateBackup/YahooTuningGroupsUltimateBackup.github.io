Double it up to<br/>&gt; 22-tET, however, and suddenly lots of consonant structures (and other good<br/>&gt; things) become available.</p><p>Whoops, I missed the 9:7 although I thought about 6:5. I was all set to post<br/>that 11:10 was good - serves me right for looking at a 22-tet table.</p><p>The reason I like 22-tet? Aside from those consonant structures and good<br/>things,  halve it and you get 11-tet!</p><p>Clark Panaccione</p></div><h3><a id=4073 href="#4073">ðŸ”—</a>hmiller@xx.xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx)</h3><span>7/29/1999 6:42:50 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>On Wed, 28 Jul 1999 20:15:38 -0100, Clark &lt;<a href="mailto:caccola@net1plus.com">caccola@net1plus.com</a>&gt; wrote:</p><p>&gt;&gt; Sounds cool.
