Some West Coasters may<br/>remember this piece.  Thanks to John Schneider for finding another copy  (...as<br/>the first remains missing).  Sunday, March 28th at Faust Harrison Pianos (205 W.<br/>58th Street) features polymicrotonal works by Jane Rigler (&quot;Alba&quot;), and yours<br/>truly.  AFMMer Anastasia Solberg will be featured in three additional works,<br/>twice with pianist Joshua Pierce.  These works are &quot;microtonal&quot; only in the<br/>viola part.  (The theme is &quot;Microtones Lite&quot;.) These composers are Stephen<br/>Mayer, Isang Yun, and Victoria Bond.</p><p>My piece is all about the oboe and its powerful timbral voice.  Dutch master<br/>Bram Kreeftmeijer is sure to surprise as soloist.  The piece is called<br/>Melanin.</p><p>BTW, the Bach was rather gorgeous...but hey, I may be subjective.

Besides, the<br/>cantata is called, Ich habe genug.</p><p>While listed as conductor for all three pieces, 3 rehearsals focused the<br/>musicians on following my directions without my actually standing in front of<br/>them.  The only time I actually &quot;conducted&quot; real time was when there was a vocal<br/>soloist, leading to a complexity that required real time leadership.  I took<br/>off for the last recitative and aria so that the piece could end in that freer<br/>way of having the musicians offering a chamber music quality to the music.</p><p>The music is all important: conducting is practiced only when necessary.<br/>What was so beautiful is that it was not at all necessary, except for what has<br/>been described above.  (At least this way, I know that the players were all<br/>satisfied with the tempi, as was I.)  Besides, there were no conductors, as such,<br/>in Bach&apos;s day.</p><p>&gt; Michael Harrison and I feel that Johnny needed to have more material<br/>&gt; in the program notes about the Werckmeister tuning... like where<br/>&gt; the &quot;pure&quot; fifths are, etc...<br/>&gt;</p><p>If the two of you don&apos;t know, I&apos;d say look it up.

I remember saying to Michael, who was obviously enthralled<br/>with the music, that the tuning was great temperament, not non-temperament,<br/>or Just.  I wanted to emphasize how an exact tuning of non-just interval (but<br/>with some) could be used by the master composer in a way that a just tuning<br/>could not.</p><p>Stuart Isacoff was floating off the ground 2 inches.

My opinion, after performing Werckmeister III Bach<br/>for several years, is that explaining how to tune up a keyboard does not aid<br/>in the listening and acceptance of the performance.  It does not explain away<br/>the 39 different intervals, for example.  Besides, we are not asking people in<br/>the concert situation to try tuning up instruments at home.  For example, I<br/>did not and cannot explain how to put the scotch tape on either the oboe or the<br/>flute, or any other instrument.  I suggest you just take in the musical<br/>experience and digest it and leave your intellect for later researches.</p><p>&gt;<br/>&gt; I notice that Barbour defines some Werckmeister temperaments<br/>&gt; as &quot;correct&quot; and the one you used, I think, is not one of them.<br/>&gt;</p><p>Barbour&apos;s Werckmeister I is OUR Werckmeister III.

It does not explain away<br/>&gt; the 39 different intervals, for example.</p><p>I agree that a simple description of a tuning such as you gave (and JP<br/>liked) is not going to greatly enlighten an audience.  It is also true that<br/>people who are already familiar with a tuning may be more (or less)<br/>enlightened by such a description.</p><p>But all that aside I think there is a distinction here that is not being<br/>talked about.  The description you gave is both a description of how to tune<br/>and instrument *and* a description of the resulting tuning.  A description<br/>of how to tune an instrument is most likely not that interesting to an<br/>audience, unless the audience is quite specialized.  However, a description<br/>of a tuning for what it *is* in its final result, what it *means* to the<br/>musician, etc. this can be fleshed out to the point where it *is*<br/>interesting to an audience.  The much larger number of intervals can be<br/>addressed.  What does this mean *more* intervals?  What is an interval?  Can<br/>the audience hear an interval?  Of course they can.  An interval is an<br/>experience, in itself.  An interval in a piece of music is part of a larger<br/>experience.  More different intervals means a richer experience.  I&apos;m not<br/>saying that you *should* do this if you have no interest in it, but this can<br/>be demonstrated by allowing people to hear intervals of different sizes so<br/>they can recognize that the experiences are different.  This does not have<br/>to be stated in such a way as to suggest to the audience that they are<br/>supposed to analyze music as they are hearing it.  Rather it can be<br/>explained in such a way as to wake them up to the possibility that what they<br/>are about to experience may be in some way richer than music they might hear<br/>elsewhere.  Sharing of meaning can be an important part of priming an<br/>audience for an actual experience.  It is not even important that the<br/>meaning is absolutely definitive in its content.  It is common in some<br/>situations for a performer to tell stories about a composer and their<br/>musical meanings prior to a performance or even prior to an individual<br/>piece.  These are &quot;just&quot; stories but if they are good stores audiences do so<br/>love them.  A good story can enliven the listener so they are more open to<br/>an experience.  The importance here is more one of awakening and engaging<br/>the audience rather than of imosing a particular bias on an experience.  A<br/>&quot;story about a tuning&quot; is another possible kind of story.  I can be<br/>meaningful, engaging.  It may alert the listener that something potentially<br/>much more meaningful &quot;than usual&quot; is about to happen for them.  I think this<br/>can be a good thing.  Again I don&apos;t mean to suggest anything like an<br/>obligation that any such thing be done.  Rather I&apos;d like to see each person<br/>presenting things the way they *love* to present it.  This may be different<br/>for JP than for Johnny.  What JP *wants* from a performance in terms of<br/>&quot;suportive&quot; or &quot;meaningful&quot; material on the side may be different from what<br/>Johnny wants.  That&apos;s what makes life interesting.</p><p>Personally I like to offer as many different layers of meaning as possible<br/>to an audience.  My audiences are usually *very* small (so far).  I also<br/>sometimes make a point of *not* offering any specific information so that<br/>people can have a clear enough experience of their own that they could form<br/>their *own* words about it all.  In a really small setting considerable<br/>audience interaction is possible, and feedback from the audience can also be<br/>quite enlivening.  I feel as much responsibility as a &quot;teacher&quot; (for lack of<br/>a better word) as a musician.  I want to be a conveyer of experience, an<br/>enlivener of experience.  This is one of the things I love to do.  I love it<br/>because of what comes back to me as a result.  I want to feel as fully<br/>engaged as possible myself, so that I have the most to offer.  We each can<br/>create our own ways to go about this and need not stick with any traditional<br/>forms regarding what is a &quot;performance&quot;, etc.  We can find what works for us<br/>and what we like to do.</p><p>-Kurt</p><p>&gt; Besides, we are not asking people in<br/>&gt; the concert situation to try tuning up instruments at home.  For example, I<br/>&gt; did not and cannot explain how to put the scotch tape on either the oboe or<br/>&gt; the<br/>&gt; flute, or any other instrument.
