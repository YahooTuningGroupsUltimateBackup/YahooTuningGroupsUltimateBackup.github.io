None, save a handful of malcontents,<br/>&gt; that&apos;d be us, whom barely constitute a seconds thought when it comes<br/>&gt; to anything resembling a market.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; The day that a Tom Morello or a Bill Frisell ditch their twelve-tone<br/>&gt; equal temperament instruments for good, well then we might get a whiff<br/>&gt; of serious interest from some manufacturer with the all important<br/>&gt; qualifier -- real distribution...<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; If blatantly, explicitly twelve-tone equal temperament instruments are<br/>&gt; hanging on the walls of all the music stores kids (and the curious)<br/>&gt; are gonna grab &apos;em and check them out.

Even the master 12 tET players<br/>&gt; that we know have explored microtonality - like Steve Vai - aren&apos;t<br/>&gt; doing anything of significance to draw an audience or musical<br/>&gt; instrument manufacturers to the cause. It was mentioned by Neil<br/>&gt; recently, that it was sad that McLaughlin has walked the 12 tET path<br/>&gt; even with his lifetime involvement with Indian music - now this *IS*<br/>&gt; indeed strange! Him of all people, to still embrace 12 tET this way<br/>&gt; will remain paradoxical to me for all my days.<br/>&gt;</p><p>This is where it gets difficult. Even with the number of great players that<br/>HAVE explored microtonality or fretless, intelligent music by real<br/>musicians/guitarists is a miniscule part of market share compared to the<br/>drivel being sold as McMusic. I can think of a number of &quot;known players&quot;<br/>who&apos;ve used some level of microtonality in their music; Adrian Belew has<br/>used fretless, McLaughlin when he used the scalloped fretboard acoustic in<br/>Shakti, one of the Sonic Youth guitarists studied/played with Glenn Branca,<br/>Matthew Monfort with Ancient Future, along with lots of others known to us<br/>and not the larger market. Unfortunately, the market is still, and probably<br/>will always be dominated by the status quo. It would have to be the guitar<br/>equivalent of Kenny G using microtonality, and I&apos;m not sure we even want to<br/>go there...</p><p>&gt; May the sexiest microtonalists among us please step forward -<br/>&gt; especially if you look good in high-heels!!!  }:  )<br/>&gt;</p><p>I look pretty decent (if I do say so) in a dress, but as a longtime<br/>vegetarian feminist, I don&apos;t do fur or heels.</p><p>Seth</p><p>--<br/>Seth Austen<br/><a href="http://www.sethausten.com">http://www.sethausten.com</a><br/>email; <a href="mailto:seth@sethausten.com">seth@sethausten.com</a></p><p>&quot;i can&apos;t be the only whatever it is i am in the room&quot;<br/>                         -- Ani DiFranco</p></div><h3><a id=16653 href="#16653">ðŸ”—</a>David Beardsley &#x3C;xouoxno@virtulink.com&#x3E;</h3><span>12/17/2000 2:06:46 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Seth Austen wrote:</p><p>&gt; I wonder whether the current state of affairs is changing, however slowly.<br/>&gt; Now that G&amp;L is manufacturing different varieties of frettings on electric,<br/>&gt; and G&amp;L and Godin and Fernandes are selling fretless guitars, I can&apos;t help<br/>&gt; but think that there will be more of a possibility that once a few of these<br/>&gt; instruments are on the walls at music stores, a few more guitar players will<br/>&gt; get curious and jump in.</p><p>G&amp;L just supplies the guitars with out fret slots, the<br/>rest is done by FreeNote Music - <a href="http://microtones.com">http://microtones.com</a></p><p>--<br/>* D a v i d         B e a r d s l e y<br/>* 49/32  R a d i o &quot;all microtonal, all the time&quot;<br/>* <a href="http://www.virtulink.com/immp/lookhere.htm">http://www.virtulink.com/immp/lookhere.htm</a></p></div><h3><a id=16681 href="#16681">ðŸ”—</a>ligonj@northstate.net</h3><span>12/18/2000 10:30:25 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@egroups.com">tuning@egroups.com</a>, Seth Austen &lt;acoustic@l...&gt; wrote:</p><p>&gt; Unfortunately, the market is still, and probably<br/>&gt; will always be dominated by the status quo.

It is unfortunate that the &quot;status<br/>quo&quot; is so spoon-fed by the packaging of pop music and art, which<br/>falls into the insidious category of practice, of subjugating just<br/>about everything that is sacred to human nature (e.g. sex, love,<br/>images of success) to perpetuate itself and the spirit of self<br/>obsessed materialism that rules our land. This is why I&apos;ve been on a<br/>conscious boycott of TV since age 18, and I rather listen to a good<br/>Orchestra of Monkeys playing a Concerto for Trashcan, than to be<br/>forced to listen to the banality that is pop radio.</p><p>When one searches their heart for the truths about music (and life),<br/>instead of letting the &quot;Big Corpo&quot; content controlling media tell you<br/>what&apos;s the in vogue flavors and haircuts of the day, then one is able<br/>to tap into the elemental forms which are timeless - like the musical<br/>archetypes of &quot;intonation&quot;.</p><p>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; May the sexiest microtonalists among us please step forward -<br/>&gt; &gt; especially if you look good in high-heels!!!  }:  )<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; I look pretty decent (if I do say so) in a dress, but as a longtime<br/>&gt; vegetarian feminist, I don&apos;t do fur or heels.<br/>&gt;</p><p>Well I&apos;m afraid I will be of little use to the cause here, since I<br/>look like Leonid Breznef&apos;s twin brother, and my legs have been<br/>mistaken for fur, I think it&apos;s best if I stay out of the microtonal<br/>limelight, whether in dress, heels or thong!</p><p>Jacky Ligon</p></div>
