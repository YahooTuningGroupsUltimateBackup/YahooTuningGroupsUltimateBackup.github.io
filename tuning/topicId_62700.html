I think I can finally (!) phrase<br/>&gt; this question correctly, and invite your thoughts:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Is there a good general approach for finding out<br/>&gt; the inconsistencies in approximation by n-EDO<br/>&gt; of all intervals up to the odd m-limit (m &amp; n both<br/>&gt; odd)?</p><p>Why would n have to be odd, or why would it make a difference? Above,<br/>n=72.</p><p>Let me illustrate the general approach with the example of 72-equal.</p><p>Express each odd number up to m&apos;s ratio (to 1) in steps of the ET<br/>(EDO implies no approximations to ratios, so I won&apos;t use that<br/>acronym):</p><p>3 is approximated by 114.12 steps<br/>5 is approximated by 167.18 steps<br/>7 is approximated by 202.13 steps<br/>9 is approximated by 228.23 steps<br/>11 is approximated by 249.08 steps<br/>13 is approximated by 266.43 steps<br/>15 is approximated by 281.3 steps<br/>17 is approximated by 294.3 steps<br/>19 is approximated by 305.85 steps</p><p>Next, write down what fraction of a step each one overshoots or<br/>undershoots (in the latter case, use a negative value) its best<br/>approximation in the ET. These fractions will all be between -0.5 and<br/>0.5:</p><p>3 overshoots by 0.12 steps<br/>5 overshoots by 0.18 steps<br/>7 overshoots by 0.13 steps<br/>9 overshoots by 0.23 steps<br/>11 overshoots by 0.08 steps<br/>13 overshoots by 0.43 steps<br/>15 overshoots by 0.3 steps<br/>17 overshoots by 0.3 steps<br/>19 overshoots by -0.15 steps</p><p>Now, if and only if the difference between the highest and lowest of<br/>these values is greater than 0.5, we have inconsistency. In this case,</p><p>0.43 - (-0.15) = 0.58, so 72-equal is inconsistent in the 19-limit.</p><p>The numbers above also make it clear that 72-equal is consistent in<br/>the 17-limit.</p><p>Thanks to Paul Hahn for this algorithm.</p><p>This table by Paul Hahn:</p><p><a href="http://library.wustl.edu/~manynote/consist3.txt">http://library.wustl.edu/~manynote/consist3.txt</a></p><p>shows the greatest error, in cents, of each ET in each odd limit in<br/>which it is consistent. Since 72-equal has 8 numbers to the right of<br/>the &quot;|&quot;, we know that it&apos;s consistent up to an odd limit of 2*8 + 1 =<br/>17. We can also see from this table that within the 11-odd-limit, 72-<br/>equal commits no error 4 cents or greater . . .</p></div>
