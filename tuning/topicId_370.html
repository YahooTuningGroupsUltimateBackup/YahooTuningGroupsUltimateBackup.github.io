If one<br/>did them by ear (using slowed down bird song) one would<br/>find more notes, but it would take quite a while.</p><p>Mostly British bird song, and mostly ones I&apos;ve heard<br/>(though some I&apos;d like to hear but haven&apos;t yet).</p><p>The golden eagle transcription is more tuneful<br/>than the recording, and I&apos;ve done it on Shanai as<br/>attempt to get a more &quot;raucous&quot; type sound.</p><p>You set a minimum note length for FTS to search<br/>for and tweak various other parameters until it is<br/>finding as many of the notes as one can get it to find.<br/>If note glissandos or has vibrato, will find the<br/>average pitch, or a series of pitches for a long glissando<br/>(if not too fast).</p><p>It&apos;s done by counting note crossings, much more accurate<br/>than FFT - you can get accuracy of about +-0.1 cents for a 0.1<br/>second note if note is optimal, such as sine wave<br/>(by linear interpolation between the<br/>two samples before and after change of sign).</p><p>Only works for some timbres, but most of the birdsong<br/>timbres are pretty good. So is singing, recorder,<br/>even string instruments, if you tweak the paramaters<br/>according to the instrument (for these timbres,<br/>you need to set it to ignore secondary waves<br/>lower in amplitude than the primary one).</p><p>Examples of birdsong that it hasn&apos;t worked for, not yet,<br/>are Reed Bunting, wood pigeon, and chaffinch.</p><p>New version of FTS will also have FFT which one can<br/>use to find partials of a timbre, and by peak interpolation<br/>between the frequency bins, you can get pretty accurate<br/>partials too for short notes.</p><p>You will be able to sing / play a seed into new version<br/>of FTS for it to use for the fractal tune, though it may<br/>add apparently extra notes, e.g. from the attack, or the<br/>in-between note clicks you sometimes get with the recorder.</p><p>More later - lots to do still!</p><p>Page will need to be moved soon - nbci stop their<br/>web hosting service mid July. Good free hosting is getting<br/>hard to find now, if one needs a lot of web space and<br/>possibly high bandwidth (i.e. so visitors can<br/>download megabyte size files such as programs), so<br/>haven&apos;t quite sorted out where it goes yet.</p><p>Plan to use the birdsong in fractal tunes, and<br/>possibly in organised pieces too. Page has a fractal<br/>tune using the curlew song.</p><p>I include the ts files as well, as you should be able to<br/>play them in the current beta even if you can&apos;t yet<br/>make them - and try changing voice / speed / pitch<br/>etc or use in fractal tunes.</p><p>Robert</p></div><h3><a id=378 href="#378">ðŸ”—</a>Robert Walker &#x3C;robertwalker@...&#x3E;</h3><span>7/13/2001 6:48:00 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Hi there:</p><p>New url:</p><p><a href="http://tunesmithy.netfirms.com/tunes/birdsong.htm">http://tunesmithy.netfirms.com/tunes/birdsong.htm</a></p><p>nbci is very slow at present, and this new site is<br/>really fast.</p><p>Apologies if anyone followed the <a href="http://spaceport.com">spaceport.com</a> urls<br/>that I had as alternative on the nbci page for a short while - didn&apos;t<br/>know about the popups that appear - not when you view<br/>the page, but later (somehow), and are resized so<br/>that the caption bar goes outside the screen, so that they<br/>are hard to get rid of.

However,<br/>program itself isn&apos;t quite ready to upload, still at<br/>the stage of finding bugs and fixing them as they arise.</p><p>I&apos;ve also made a couple of major revisions of the way parts of<br/>the program are organised recently and am gradually going through<br/>it all getting everything in line again.</p><p>The changes are: midi relaying to support multiple output ports,<br/>which is the current beta preview, and the part to do with showing the values<br/>in edit fields and check boxes and saving them at end of<br/>session etc - I&apos;ve figured out a way to do it with just a single<br/>line of code for each one that I write myself, with the rest generated<br/>from those lines with a little code generator I wrote. Will make quite a<br/>difference for a program with as many edit boxes and check boxes as<br/>FTS. However needs a shakedown period to delete all the old code,<br/>carefully! So, not uploaded anywhere yet.</p><p>Advantage is - if you see the value displayed correctly in the box,<br/>then you know it will be saved to the .ini file correctly, read from it<br/>okay, initialised correctly on Reset or New, is declared as correct variable<br/>type and with extern to it, and is read correctly from the box too -<br/>seven places in the code to check for each one reduced to just one place<br/>to check, so will make quite a difference for debugging - it&apos;s this repetetive<br/>type of work that is most responsible for introducing bugs I find.</p><p>In same way, when adding a new dialog to FTS, requires editing in<br/>nine places in the code at present, and I&apos;ll reduce that to a single<br/>place, with the rest all auto-generated.</p><p>I&apos;ll prob. do some gifs of &quot;scores&quot; for the bird-song too as that is easy<br/>to do in FTS.</p><p>Enjoyed your base solo!</p><p>Robert</p></div>
