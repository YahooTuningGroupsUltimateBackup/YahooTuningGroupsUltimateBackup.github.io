YIKES!</p><p>Shoe polish!?  Please, try it out on scrap to be sure that it dries!  I<br/>never thought of waxes as forming any kind of durable coating.  Jon Catler<br/>recommended 2-ton epoxy for fretless necks for sustain and durability.  (or<br/>was it 4-ton?)  Nitrocellulose Lacquer is often used as a covering for maple<br/>fretboards on guitars.  It&apos;s very toxic to spray though, and has limited<br/>durability.  Any hard film finish is ton&apos;s better than shoe polish.</p><p>Two reasons NOT to use shoe polish.</p><p>1. I once worked on a cello that had been &quot;tinted&quot; with shoe polish at least<br/>5 years earlier.  There were still resinous dusty gobs that could be peeled<br/>off with your fingernail, revealing damaged varnish underneath.  Yuck!</p><p>2. My brother once painted black stripes on his white goat with shoe polish<br/>to make it look like a zebra for a Halloween party.  (no kidding!)  The<br/>guests all ended up covered with the black resin.</p><p>I have also heard that brass and stainless steel are safer than aluminum.<br/>Stainless steel is used on sarods.  Little too late for that suggestion<br/>though.</p><p>---<br/>Glen Peterson<br/>30 Elm Street North Andover, MA 01845<br/>(978) 975-1527<br/><a href="http://www.OrganicDesign.org/Glen/Instruments">http://www.OrganicDesign.org/Glen/Instruments</a></p><p>&gt; -----Original Message-----<br/>&gt; From: Rick Sanford [<a href="mailto:rsanf@pais.org">mailto:rsanf@pais.org</a>]<br/>&gt; Sent: Thursday, August 19, 1999 9:23 AM<br/>&gt; To: <a href="mailto:tuning@onelist.com">tuning@onelist.com</a><br/>&gt; Subject: Re: [tuning] Callisto : aluminum oxide<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; From: Rick Sanford &lt;<a href="mailto:rsanf@pais.org">rsanf@pais.org</a>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Hi Drew:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Please take the black finger seriously.
