There are five lines on the staff because there are<br/>    five<br/>     fingers on your hand.&quot;  To which Terry Gross (no slouch herself on<br/>    musical<br/>     matters) said disbelievingly &quot;I didn&apos;t know that!&quot;  Steve Reich, giving<br/>    no<br/>     ground: &quot;Yeah, well, you know, live and learn.&quot;<br/>    -psl]<br/>    ____________________________________________________________________________<br/>     Quoth _The Harvard Brief Dictionary of Music_:<br/>      STAFF (stave). Five parallel horizontal lines, upon and between<br/>      which musical notes are written, thus indicating their relative<br/>      pitch and, in connection with a clef, their absolute notation (see<br/>      under //notation//). The invention of the staff is attributed to<br/>      Guido of Arezzo (c. 995-1050), who recommended the use of three or<br/>      four lines, denoting f a c&apos; or d f a c&apos;.  Even before him,<br/>      rudimentary staffs of two lines, a red one for f and a yellow one<br/>      for c&apos;, were used.  The four-line staff was generally accepted, and<br/>      is retained to this day for the notation of Gregorian chant.<br/>      Five-line staffs, for polyphonic music, were used as early as 1200.<br/>      In the 16th century staffs of up to seven and eight lines were<br/>      employed for keyboard music, particularly for the lower staff (left<br/>      hand) which otherwise would require numerous ledger lines.<br/>    ____________________________________________________________________________<br/>    well, this makes sense, when we consider the evolutionary development of<br/>    the<br/>    human hand.  the early staves were only four and three lines (as little<br/>    as<br/>    two), because humans only had two, three, and four fingers back then.<br/>    the<br/>    hand then evolved to include up to seven and eight fingers, but was<br/>    happening so quickly, that the roman catholic church thought it demonic,<br/>    and<br/>    began cutting off people&apos;s &quot;excess&quot; fingers (excess determined, in good<br/>    roman catholic tradition, by a democratic vote).  this of course was the</p><p>    true intention of the inquisition.<br/>    ____________________________________________________________________________</p></div>
